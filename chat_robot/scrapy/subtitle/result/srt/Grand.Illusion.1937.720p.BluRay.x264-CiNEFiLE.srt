嘿，哈芬…
要去阿盘尼？
什么时候？
半小时以后
Hey, Halphen... Going to Epernay?
- When?
- In half an hour.

8
00:02:58,609 --> 00:03:00,541
在你们卡车里边？…
带我上吧
In your truck?... Give me a ride.

9
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,541
当然…约瑟芬？
- Sure...Josephine?
- Of course!

10
00:03:02,611 --> 00:03:03,542
当然

11
00:03:03,612 --> 00:03:04,543
不单独行
- You're not the only one.
- Big deal!

12
00:03:04,612 --> 00:03:08,544
大买卖

13
00:03:10,614 --> 00:03:13,545
我说，马利沙…
你得接待一位长官
Say, Mar閏hal...
You have to take up a staff officer.

14
00:03:13,615 --> 00:03:15,546
他来的不是时候
He's picked the wrong time.

15
00:03:15,616 --> 00:03:16,547
又是约瑟芬
-Josephine again?
- Yeah, Josephine.

16
00:03:16,616 --> 00:03:18,548
是啊，约瑟芬

17
00:03:18,616 --> 00:03:20,548
那你会有什么收获？
Where will all that get you?

18
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:24,550
她只要等就是了
She'll just have to wait.

19
00:03:37,624 --> 00:03:40,555
酒精伤人
酒精令人疯狂！
Liquor kills!
Liquor drives you crazy!

20
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:44,558
空军中队长喝它
The squadron leader drinks it!

21
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:52,561
波狄奥上尉，
这是陆军长官，分队的…
Captain de Boeldieu.
Staff officer, division...

22
00:03:53,632 --> 00:03:57,564
马利沙先生你见过这幅画吗？
Do you know this photo, Mr. Mar閏hal?

23
00:03:58,069 --> 00:04:00,564
当然见过，
是里科跟我弄的
Sure. Ricord took it with me.

24
00:04:00,634 --> 00:04:02,565
那我哪里可找到里科先生？
And where can I find Mr. Ricord?

25
00:04:02,634 --> 00:04:05,566
他休假了
那是
- On leave.
- Of course.

26
00:04:05,635 --> 00:04:08,567
我担心这灰色的污迹…
This gray smudge worries me...

27
00:04:08,636 --> 00:04:10,568
这里，就在这路下面
Here, just below the road.

28
00:04:10,638 --> 00:04:14,570
那不是路，是条隧道
不，是铁道
- That's not a road, it's a canal.
- No, a railway.

29
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,572
如此一致，
是我们的空中摄影机的荣誉
Such unanimity
honors our aerial cameras.

30
00:04:18,641 --> 00:04:19,572
需很大，那天
It was a foggy day.

31
00:04:19,641 --> 00:04:22,572
我要解决这难题
I'd like to resolve this enigma.

32
00:04:22,643 --> 00:04:26,043
我需要一架飞机
I'll request a plane.

33
00:04:26,045 --> 00:04:29,575
我去准备一下，长官
I'll go get ready, sir.

34
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:31,079
飞行衣还是毛夹克？
Flying suit or fur jacket?

35
00:04:31,081 --> 00:04:35,578
无特别要求
飞行衣臭，毛夹脱毛
No preference.
Flying suits smell, fur jackets shed.

36
00:04:35,648 --> 00:04:39,580
空军中队战机组
Get me the fighter squadron.

37
00:04:55,654 --> 00:04:59,587
开一辆车到糖加工厂
Take a car to the sugar refinery.

38
00:04:59,658 --> 00:05:02,589
刚刚我击落一个科特伦战机
I just shot down a Caudron fiighter.

39
00:05:02,658 --> 00:05:04,589
他们如果是长官
If they're Officers,

40
00:05:04,659 --> 00:05:08,591
就邀请他们来吃午饭
invite them for lunch.

41
00:05:18,664 --> 00:05:20,596
弗莱斯…
Freisler...

42
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:24,598
让我们成为你的一员
make us one of your famous
fruit punches

43
00:05:24,667 --> 00:05:28,599
去庆祝我打下第十二架飞机
to celebrate the downing
of my twelfth plane.

44
00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:33,600
两瓶莫西乐…
两个来恩
Three bottles of Moselle...
two Rhine...

45
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,601
半瓶玛特尔…
half a bottle of Martel...

46
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,601

47
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,603
二瓶矿泉水
two seltzer...

48
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:43,605
菠萝
pineapples...

49
00:05:45,675 --> 00:05:49,606
有两个长官，一个受伤，
我已带他去医务处
Two officers. One is wounded.
I took him to the infirmary.

50
00:05:52,678 --> 00:05:56,609
劳芬斯坦上尉，
21空军中队
Captain von Rauffenstein,
CO, 21 st Squadron.

51
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,611
玻狄奥上尉，参谋
Captain de Boeldieu, staff officer.

52
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,679
马利莎中校，飞行员
Lt. Mar閏hal, pilot.
My apologies.

53
00:06:03,681 --> 00:06:05,681
抱歉
My officers.

54
00:06:05,683 --> 00:06:12,615
我的长官们
很荣幸，我能执行法国客人
I am honored to have French guests.

55
00:06:12,686 --> 00:06:15,616
现在，先生们，
我们吃吧
Now, gentlemen, let us eat.

56
00:06:15,687 --> 00:06:19,618
大衣要放好！
Orderly, coats!

57
00:06:38,696 --> 00:06:40,626
弗莱斯，你的酒…
Freisler, your punch...

58
00:06:40,697 --> 00:06:42,627
我可为你效劳？
May I serve you?

59
00:06:42,697 --> 00:06:46,628
我认识一个在柏林的玻狄奥…
I knew a Boeldieu in Berlin...

60
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:51,630
一个叫坎特玻狄奥的
是我们表兄，
埃蒙得玻狄奥
a Count de Boeldieu.
My cousin, Edmond de Boeldieu.

61
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,632
他是陆军武官
He was military attach?

62
00:06:58,704 --> 00:07:04,635
他现在是战机飞行员
你吃吗？
He's a fighter pilot now.
Aren't you eating?

63
00:07:04,707 --> 00:07:06,637
我割不了肉
I can't cut the meat.

64
00:07:06,707 --> 00:07:11,638
我可以帮你吗？
谢了！
你法语很好
- May I?
- Please do.
You speak good French.

65
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:18,641
我曾在里昂做过机修工
不是开以，
我也是机修工…
I was a mechanic in Lyons.
No kidding!
Me too, I'm a mecha...

66
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:33,648
致克鲁索上尉，
法国飞行兵团
被击落于大焰中…
To Captain de Crussol,
French Flying Corps,
shotdown in flames...

67
00:07:33,718 --> 00:07:36,649
属德国第21空军中队官员
From the Officers
ofthe German 21st Squadron.

68
00:07:36,718 --> 00:07:40,650
我为这意外感到抱歉
I'm sorry about this coincidence.

69
00:07:44,722 --> 00:07:48,653
地球啊，
保佑我们英勇的战士
May the earth lie lightly
on our valiant enemy.

70
00:08:03,998 --> 00:08:08,661
我奉命带受俘长官去监房
I have orders to take custody
of the captured officers.

71
00:08:17,735 --> 00:08:22,494
第17号军官战俘营
PRISONER-OF-WAR CAMP N1 7
OFFICERS' CAMP

72
00:08:42,745 --> 00:08:46,015
向这些先生宣读营里的条例
Read these gentlemen
the camp regulations.

73
00:08:46,017 --> 00:08:51,677
长官会依其等级受不同待遇
"Officers will be treated
with the consideration due their rank."

74
00:08:51,748 --> 00:08:55,679
然而，你们要服从德国法律
"However, you are reminded
that you are subject to German law."

75
00:08:55,752 --> 00:09:00,844
因此，你们要遵守德国纪律
"You therefore must obey
the rules of German discipline."

76
00:09:01,752 --> 00:09:05,621
这里的任何德国士兵
有权命令你
"Any German soldier here
has the right to give you orders

77
00:09:05,623 --> 00:09:08,354
你们必须无条件听从
which must be obeyed without protest."

78
00:09:08,356 --> 00:09:13,688
你们要依德国军规
向长官敬礼
"You must salute Officers
according to German army regulations."

79
00:09:13,757 --> 00:09:17,688
如你们试图越逃，
哨兵可奉命射杀
"If you attempt to escape,
sentries have orders to fire on officers

80
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:20,293
在营外范围发现的长官
found outside camp limits."

81
00:09:20,295 --> 00:09:24,690
着装不许不当
"Incorrect dress is not permitted."

82
00:09:24,761 --> 00:09:26,691
禁止聚众，
不可以侮辱德国人民
" Large crowds are forbidden.
You may not insult the German people,

83
00:09:26,761 --> 00:09:32,695
不可以与营外平民通信或谈话
"or write or speak to civilians
from outside the camp."

84
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,696
禁止与哨兵倾谈
"It is forbidden
to speak to the sentries."

85
00:09:43,506 --> 00:09:48,700
先生们，
现在进行一些例行形式
Gentlemen, we will now proceed
with some minor formalities.

86
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:08,707
俄语我词堕落跟拉丁语一样
Russian nouns are declined
just like in Latin.

87
00:10:15,217 --> 00:10:18,383
新来的
去警告他们一下
- Newcomers.
- Let's warn them.

88
00:10:18,385 --> 00:10:23,552
圣洁之天使，光之天使
Angel of purity, angel of light!

89
00:10:23,554 --> 00:10:28,716
将你们的宝贝藏起来
Hide your valuables...

90
00:10:36,726 --> 00:10:41,721
他们唱什么？
叫我们世故起宝贝
- What are they singing?
- To hide our valuables.

91
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,722
放手！

92
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:44,723
不要碰我！

93
00:10:44,792 --> 00:10:48,725
要我的表？

94
00:10:51,165 --> 00:10:53,358
Don't touch!
Those belong to me.

95
00:10:53,796 --> 00:10:57,728
不要碰，这是我的

96
00:11:05,471 --> 00:11:07,501
我什么也没有，伙计
I've got nothing, old man.

97
00:11:07,503 --> 00:11:12,734
早知道，我就带些现金来
Had I known,
I'd have brought some cash.

98
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:18,735
这行为可不得体
This conduct is unbecoming.
Sorry, it's our duty to search you.
This is war.

99
00:11:18,805 --> 00:11:22,805
对不起，这是我们的责任
去搜查你，这是战争
I perfectly agree,
but conduct it courteously.

100
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:29,740
完全同意，
但可否做理体面些
若否，我要见你指挥官
If not, I'll see
your commanding officer.

101
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:42,216
你的怎么样？
你走好去啊！
How are you - kulele?
Lucky you - calyptus!

102
00:11:42,218 --> 00:11:48,747
Here, M黮ler, have some chocolate.
米勒，这里，吃点巧克力
你没打开我的火腿！
You've no right to open my ham!

103
00:11:48,816 --> 00:11:57,818
规定上这么说的，
我仔细读过
烂掉了，你吃个够吧
It's in the regulations.
I read them carefully.
It's rotten! You can have it!
He's hard to please.

104
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:58,752
他挺难搞
I'm delighted when my folks
send a parcel.

105
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:02,820
家人寄包裹过来，
我感到高兴
Here we are,
in the heart of Germany,

106
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:04,821
终于到了这里，
德国中心
cut off from our families by the front,

107
00:12:04,823 --> 00:12:07,822
前线将其与我们家庭分开
and here's a can of peas,
direct from Paris.

108
00:12:07,824 --> 00:12:10,824
这里是一罐豆，法国来的
Is it all right?

109
00:12:10,826 --> 00:12:17,760
还好吧？
真是奇迹，狱卒
对我们的包裹竟如此诚意
I'm amazed at how honest
our jailers are with our parcels.

110
00:12:17,898 --> 00:12:22,033
的确，看我们的阿瑟…
It's true!
Take our feldwebel, Arthur...

111
00:12:22,035 --> 00:12:27,093
他每天吃白菜，
他告诉我，胃里难受
He eats cabbage every day.
It sticks in his craw. He told me so.

112
00:12:29,171 --> 00:12:33,001
他倒很愿意吃你的豆呢
He'd much rather lay into your peas.

113
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:34,870
跟自己开什么玩笑！
Don't kid yourselves.

114
00:12:34,872 --> 00:12:38,038
如他们这样做，
我们就没包裹了
If they did that,
our parcels would stop coming.

115
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,238
他们也缺食物啊
They're short of food for themselves.

116
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,274
快点，我们的客人帮饿了
Hurry, our guests will be hungry.

117
00:12:44,276 --> 00:12:48,609
这尝起来真糟！
This tastes like an old sock!

118
00:12:48,611 --> 00:12:50,843
那些法国人吃什么？
What do they feed the French?

119
00:12:50,845 --> 00:12:54,243
白菜，但他们可以有包裹
Cabbage, but they have their parcels.

120
00:12:54,245 --> 00:12:57,579
那俄国人呢？
白菜根，但没包裹
- And the Russians?
- Cabbage roots, but no parcels.

121
00:12:57,581 --> 00:13:01,747
那英国人呢？
And the English?

122
00:13:01,749 --> 00:13:04,614
战前我做过演员…
I was on the stage before the war...

123
00:13:04,616 --> 00:13:07,779
表演轻舞歌剧
in vaudeville.

124
00:13:07,847 --> 00:13:11,119
有见到我吗？
剧院大难了
- Ever see me?
- Theater's too deep for me.

125
00:13:11,121 --> 00:13:12,852
我较喜欢骑车运动
I prefer bicycling.

126
00:13:12,854 --> 00:13:15,420
参加过法国之旅？
You follow the Tour de France?

127
00:13:15,422 --> 00:13:20,783
你定听说过法布特，
加里葛，派提布莱登…
You must've heard of Fabert,
Garrigoud, Petit Breton...

128
00:13:24,891 --> 00:13:26,956
我们买东西可否有喜好？
Can we purchase what we like?

129
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:29,091
可以，不过是在饭堂里
Yes, through the canteen.

130
00:13:29,093 --> 00:13:33,191
啊，好！
我想买一张舒服的靠椅…
Fine, I'll buy myself
a comfortable armchair...

131
00:13:33,193 --> 00:13:36,061
用来玩牌，
看书，抽烟
playing cards, a few books,
English cigarettes.

132
00:13:36,063 --> 00:13:40,792
没有这些的
You won't fiind those.

133
00:13:42,031 --> 00:13:44,698
这样吧，长官，
我明天再来
There you go, sir.
I'll come again tomorrow.

134
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:49,794
先生们，该吃饭了
Gentlemen, time to eat.

135
00:13:51,568 --> 00:13:56,798
长官…
Sir...

136
00:13:58,038 --> 00:14:00,805
先生们，我们先吃什么？
So, gentlemen,
what shall we begin with?

137
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:02,805
鸡，还是这个？
Chicken, foie gras,

138
00:14:02,807 --> 00:14:05,239
还是这上尉弄的鱼？
or Captain Cook mackerel?

139
00:14:05,241 --> 00:14:06,939
你个富足
You're well provisioned.

140
00:14:06,941 --> 00:14:09,540
他们让我们在这里吃饭？
Don't they feed us here?

141
00:14:09,542 --> 00:14:14,443
理论上如此，
但我们无法下咽
In theory, they do,
but what they give us is inedible.

142
00:14:14,445 --> 00:14:19,808
好在我们有包裹，
特别有我朋友罗斯坦的
Fortunately, we have our parcels,
especially our friend Rosenthal's.
Oh, please!

143
00:14:19,877 --> 00:14:20,808
唔，请吧！
A cognac to start with, sir?

144
00:14:20,877 --> 00:14:24,876
先来点白兰地吧？
I've never eaten so well in my life.

145
00:14:24,878 --> 00:14:27,809
我从来没吃这么少
Some fish?

146
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:28,810
来点鱼？
I'm getting used to
Rosenthal's kindness.

147
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:31,878
我都习惯罗斯坦的好意了
Man is such an adaptable creature.

148
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:37,149
你知道吗？
他是个教授…
You can see he's a professor...

149
00:14:37,319 --> 00:14:39,618
教她…信仰她…
Profess her... Confess her...

150
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:44,817
跟她说话…
脱她衣服…
Address her... undress her...
Oops, a slip!

151
00:14:44,887 --> 00:14:45,818
噢，打油诗！
You're quite a joker!

152
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:47,885
你真会开玩笑
Is that supposed to be witty?

153
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,886
这也是智慧？
He's hard to please!

154
00:14:50,888 --> 00:14:53,888
噢，他挺难搞的
Let's drink to peace!

155
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,821
为和平而干杯！
Not bad, this cognac.

156
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:56,821
这白兰地不错
Comes from Fouquet's
in mouthwash bottles.

157
00:14:56,891 --> 00:15:00,594
弗科产的，漱口水瓶装的
弗科产的？
Fouquet's?

158
00:15:00,596 --> 00:15:08,827
It's a bar on the Champs-Elys閑s.
这是爱丽舍宫旁的一个酒吧
去巴黎时，
我在妹夫家吃喝，较便宜
When I went to Paris, I ate
at my brother-in-law's. It's cheaper.

159
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,931
最近去过巴黎吗？
上周去过
- Been to Paris lately?
- Last week.

160
00:15:11,933 --> 00:15:15,828
真走运！很多人吗？
Lucky man! Places crowded?
Maxim's was packed.

161
00:15:15,898 --> 00:15:17,897
马克沁机枪给堵了
I never go to places like that...

162
00:15:17,899 --> 00:15:20,897
我没去过这样的地方
I prefer a nice little bar...
with good wine.

163
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:27,901
我较喜欢一个漂亮小吧…
有好酒
马克沁机枪…
也不知道这个
- Maxim's... don't know it either.
- It's no great loss.

164
00:15:27,903 --> 00:15:28,835
无关紧要
We know you eat
at your brother-in-law's...

165
00:15:28,903 --> 00:15:32,836
我们知道
你在你妹夫家里吃…

166
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:40,838
他永远都不放松点！
He never lets up!

167
00:15:40,978 --> 00:15:44,840
莫那科先生在这吗？
Is he there, "Mr. Monocle"?
No, he's not.

168
00:15:44,909 --> 00:15:45,840
不，不在！
I've just been to the canteen.
It's about his armchair request...

169
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:50,909
我刚去过餐厅，
是他要张靠椅…
Let him tighten his belt!

170
00:15:50,911 --> 00:15:51,843
让他系紧他的带子
I'll tell him.

171
00:15:51,912 --> 00:15:55,845
我会告诉他的

172
00:15:56,184 --> 00:15:59,984
拿包裹的那个人不错，
很有钱吧？
He's nice, the guy with the parcels.
Well off?

173
00:15:59,986 --> 00:16:05,777
那又怎样？
你知道罗斯坦银行吗？
And how!
You know the Rosenthal bank?
His parents.

174
00:16:05,917 --> 00:16:08,916
是他的父母
Am I tickling you?

175
00:16:08,918 --> 00:16:12,915
我弄痒你了？
他是干什么的？
- And what's he do?
- Runs a big fashion house.

176
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,852
他开有一家大时装店
Funny.
With his money, I wouldn't...

177
00:16:13,921 --> 00:16:17,921
有意思，有他的钱，
我可不…
What do you do in civilian life?

178
00:16:17,923 --> 00:16:20,923
你平常做什么？
I'm a engineer for the cadaster.

179
00:16:20,925 --> 00:16:22,922
我是卡达斯特的一个工程师
Sure, the cadaster...

180
00:16:22,924 --> 00:16:41,863
噢，是卡达斯特…
就我们之间…
我们可以信任你的伙伴，
那个上尉吗？
噢，他看起来有点怪，
但还可以
你们可以相信他
好吧
为什么呢？
天黑后，我们挖遂道，
你知道吗？
just between us...
can we trust your pal, the Captain?
He may seem strange,
but he's okay.
You can trust him all right.
- It's all right, then.
- Why?
You see, after dark...
we're digging a tunnel.
What for?

181
00:16:41,933 --> 00:16:42,864
为什么呢？
To escape.

182
00:16:42,933 --> 00:16:43,864
越狱啊
What do you dig with?

183
00:16:43,933 --> 00:16:45,931
用什么来掘土？
A coal shovel, old food cans...

184
00:16:45,933 --> 00:16:48,933
煤铲，旧罐头…
I calculate
we should come up in a garden

185
00:16:48,935 --> 00:16:56,868
我估计我们会走到一个花园
就在那些建筑后面
那里是开阔的乡村
那很慢啊
behind those buildings there.
It's open country.
That's slow work.

186
00:16:56,937 --> 00:16:58,869
我们挖了两个月了
We've been at it for two months.
just a few more weeks...

187
00:16:58,939 --> 00:17:00,871
再过几周…

188
00:17:00,939 --> 00:17:05,872
战争先结束了
不要这么灰心
The war'll be over fiirst.
You're deluding yourself.

189
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:10,875
是吗？
最好有所准备
Think so?
Best to be prepared.
Where's the tunnel?

190
00:17:10,943 --> 00:17:11,874
隧道在哪里？
You'll see tonight, after roll call.

191
00:17:11,943 --> 00:17:15,875
晚上点我后，
你就知道了
So you're digging a hole...

192
00:17:16,683 --> 00:17:19,877
像蒙特克里斯托
Like Monte Cristo. What a laugh!

193
00:17:19,947 --> 00:17:20,878
真好笑
- Thanks for the wash.
- You can't do it with your arm.

194
00:17:20,947 --> 00:17:21,879
谢谢你帮我说

195
00:17:21,947 --> 00:17:25,947
你可以用手臂洗的
Mind if I ask you something?

196
00:17:25,949 --> 00:17:27,881
介意我问你些问题吗？
Go ahead.

197
00:17:27,951 --> 00:17:28,882
问吧
What's a "cadaster"?

198
00:17:28,951 --> 00:17:32,883
"卡达斯特"是什么？

199
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:43,886
- Mar閏hal.
马利沙
到！
玻狄奥！
是玻狄奥上尉
卡迪尔
这里！到我啦！
- Present.
- Boeldieu.
- Captain de Boeldieu.
- Cartier.
- Here...we go again!

200
00:17:43,956 --> 00:17:47,889
晚安，阿瑟
Good night, Arthur!

201
00:18:26,645 --> 00:18:28,904
轮到谁了？
- Whose turn is it?
- Cartier's.

202
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:31,906
卡迪尔了

203
00:18:31,975 --> 00:18:32,907
那是干什么的？
What's that for?

204
00:18:32,975 --> 00:18:34,907
呼吸用的
For breathing.
These are to extend the line.

205
00:18:34,976 --> 00:18:37,976
这些用来延长拉线
And the bags?

206
00:18:37,978 --> 00:18:38,909
那袋呢？
For removing earth.

207
00:18:38,979 --> 00:18:45,911
移走泥土的
这是警报装置
This is the alarm.

208
00:18:46,353 --> 00:18:49,980
如我感到窒息
If I start to suffocate,
I yank on the string...

209
00:18:49,982 --> 00:18:51,980
我就拉这线
The can falls...

210
00:18:51,982 --> 00:18:56,916
这罐头就掉下来
然后你们将我拉出来
And the boys pull me out by the feet...

211
00:18:56,985 --> 00:18:57,917
拖着我的腿
The feet...

212
00:18:57,985 --> 00:19:01,918
腿！

213
00:19:03,057 --> 00:19:05,920
还等什么？
What are you waiting for?

214
00:19:05,989 --> 00:19:09,025
看我表演吧
Watch me play the mole...

215
00:19:09,027 --> 00:19:13,921
打洞啦！
mol-asses!

216
00:19:16,992 --> 00:19:18,924
隧道安全吗？
Is the tunnel safe?

217
00:19:18,993 --> 00:19:19,925
用木块筑起来了
It's shored up with wood
from the theater.

218
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:22,993
木块从剧院拿来的
And the earth?

219
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,932
那土呢？
填在地板下面
Stuffed under the floorboards.

220
00:19:25,997 --> 00:19:35,931
但没有地方了
现在我们用袋装土
在出操时，我们再倒掉它
But there's not an inch of space left.
Now we fiill bags and empty them
during exercise.

221
00:19:48,005 --> 00:19:54,938
嘿，听到吗？
我肯定听到什么
Hear that?
I'm sure I heard something.

222
00:19:56,009 --> 00:20:02,941
没有啊
听
It's nothing.
Listen...

223
00:20:03,011 --> 00:20:14,947
我们叫人去看一下
你看起来天真点
去看一下
我会装着去厕所
We'll send someone out
to check.
You've got an innocent face.
Go take a peek outside.
I'll pretend to go to the latrine.

224
00:20:48,966 --> 00:20:51,961
嘿，亚瑟，发生什么事了？
Say, Arthur, what happened?

225
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:54,300
这家伙想逃跑
The fellow tried to escape.

226
00:20:54,302 --> 00:20:57,030
我们在花园里捉住他
We caught him in the garden
behind those buildings...

227
00:20:57,032 --> 00:20:59,032
就在那些建筑后面
We opened fire.

228
00:20:59,034 --> 00:21:01,032
我们开了枪
Behind the buildings?

229
00:21:01,034 --> 00:21:03,967
那些建筑后面？
他死吗？
- Is he dead?
- I think so.

230
00:21:04,035 --> 00:21:05,966
我想是的
And you, what are you doing out?

231
00:21:06,036 --> 00:21:09,968
你在这里干什么？

232
00:21:10,043 --> 00:21:14,970
在厕所
Going to the latrine.

233
00:21:55,593 --> 00:21:58,054
怎么了？
- What was it?
- Someone tried to escape.

234
00:21:58,056 --> 00:22:05,990
有人想逃跑
他到花园那么远呢？
在那些建筑后面
一个哨兵，打中他了
He got as far as the garden
behind the buildings.
A sentry shot him.

235
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:07,991
他死了
He's dead.

236
00:22:08,061 --> 00:22:11,993
警报器！
The alarm!

237
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:21,997
没有声音
拖他出来
- No answer.
- Pull him out.

238
00:23:17,992 --> 00:23:23,019
伤得很重？
Hurt bad?

239
00:23:26,028 --> 00:23:31,023
喝些白半地
Drink some cognac.

240
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:36,024
弗科产的
From Fouquet's.

241
00:23:39,433 --> 00:23:46,029
你眼中有泥
不要把瓶掉了
Here's mud in your eye.
Don't drop the bottle.

242
00:23:47,099 --> 00:23:49,029
明天谁下去？
Who goes down tomorrow?

243
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:57,033
你了，长官，
如果你不介意
荣幸，我懂怎样在矿下爬
You do, sir... if you don't mind.
My pleasure. I understand
crawling is fine exercise.

244
00:24:00,103 --> 00:24:03,034
再提醒一次，严禁
I remind you it is strictly forbidden

245
00:24:03,105 --> 00:24:07,037
接受非军式服装
to receive non-military clothing.

246
00:24:29,253 --> 00:24:31,386
好消息吗？
Good news?

247
00:24:31,388 --> 00:24:35,116
是我阿姨的，
她住博托斯
It's from my aunt in Bordeaux.
People are swarming into town.

248
00:24:35,118 --> 00:24:38,049
人们蜂拥至城镇
有什么想法？
What do you think?

249
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:40,049
他们最好小心
They'd better watch out,

250
00:24:40,121 --> 00:24:51,054
德国人称之为一大突破
没有响铃，
所以不会有太大意思
去做些园林活？
the Germans are claiming
a major breakthrough.
There's been no bell-ringing
so it can't mean much.
Up for some gardening?

251
00:24:53,596 --> 00:24:57,056
我讨厌德国人的公告牌，
总是夸张
I hate the way
German bulletins exaggerate.

252
00:24:57,126 --> 00:24:58,429
我们报纸就不是啦？
And our papers don't?

253
00:24:58,431 --> 00:25:02,031
还记得俄国的
"蒸汽压路机"
Remember the "Russian steamroller"?

254
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:06,365
是时候做些正经事了吧？
Isn't it time we got down
to serious business?

255
00:25:06,367 --> 00:25:11,062
是，但不是突而其来
Sure, but not all at once.

256
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:52,617
那有我的大"冬季"
And that famous General "Winter,"

257
00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:55,519
小气的科劳人怕死它了
so lethal to the nasty Krauts

258
00:25:55,521 --> 00:25:58,080
对盟军都很有用
but so tonic to the Allies...

259
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:02,082
你还记得"特宾尼特"？
And do you remember "Turpinite"?

260
00:26:02,152 --> 00:26:04,082
一个烧瓶，小萝卜大小
A flask the size of... a radish
that could blow up a whole battalion.

261
00:26:04,153 --> 00:26:08,153
可以炸坏一个军营呢
They even tried it on a flock of sheep.

262
00:26:08,155 --> 00:26:16,087
他们在一群羊上试过呢
他们不收手，太坏了
Too bad they didn't stop at that.

263
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,091
你们在种些什么？
- What're you guys planting?
- Dandelions.

264
00:26:26,162 --> 00:26:27,092
蒲公英！

265
00:26:27,162 --> 00:26:34,094
我梦想吃蒲公英沙律呢
你的蒲公英长成前
战争已结束了
I'm dreaming of dandelion salad.
The war'll be over
before your dandelions grow.

266
00:26:34,164 --> 00:26:38,095
这劳动会使我们的手变壮
This singular exercise
will give us workman's hands.

267
00:26:38,202 --> 00:26:40,097
树干在这里
The trunks are here!

268
00:26:40,167 --> 00:26:41,370
制服？  剧院里呢
- The costumes?
- At the theater.

269
00:26:41,372 --> 00:26:45,571
应该有一个
放妇女衣服树干
There should be a trunk
with women's clothes.

270
00:26:45,573 --> 00:26:47,100
来吧，长官？
Coming, sir?

271
00:26:47,169 --> 00:26:48,100
我理论技巧不行
My theatrical skills are questionable.
Besides, I'm engaged.

272
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:50,100
再者，我订婚了

273
00:26:50,171 --> 00:26:57,103
玩耐性？
正是，我是现实主义者
- Playing patience?
- Exactly. I'm a realist.

274
00:27:39,262 --> 00:27:42,120
找到什么没有？
阿瑟？
Find anything, Arthur?

275
00:27:42,191 --> 00:27:44,122
我什么也没有
Nothing.

276
00:27:44,192 --> 00:27:48,124
好吧，先生们，
玩得开心点吧！
Well, gentlemen, enjoy yourselves.

277
00:27:55,195 --> 00:27:56,632
我们把这些放哪？
Where will we put all this?

278
00:27:56,634 --> 00:28:01,128
我去要些钩来
I asked for hangers.

279
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:03,502
小心点
Be careful...

280
00:28:03,504 --> 00:28:06,604
这些东东要小心爱护
These things
should be handled with care...

281
00:28:06,606 --> 00:28:09,437
要闭上眼睛
with your eyes closed.

282
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:12,132
看起来小女孩的衣服
Looks like a little girl's dress.

283
00:28:12,203 --> 00:28:16,135
现在的衣服是短的了
Dresses are short now.

284
00:28:16,204 --> 00:28:17,974
刚盖女膝而已
just below the knee.

285
00:28:17,976 --> 00:28:20,442
我听到了，
我爱看到它！
So I hear. I'd love to see that!

286
00:28:20,444 --> 00:28:22,137
那就穿上它吧
Then put it on.

287
00:28:22,206 --> 00:28:24,443
不行，他从来不刮胡子
Not him, he never shaves.

288
00:28:24,445 --> 00:28:30,139
迈森男，
你长得像天使
有什么好玩的？
- You have an angel face, Maisonneuve.
- Anything to amuse.

289
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:34,142
我们得拿清单
We have to take inventory.

290
00:28:35,283 --> 00:28:37,281
也有女紧身胸衣！
The corset, too!

291
00:28:37,283 --> 00:28:39,143
别激动
Take it easy.

292
00:28:39,212 --> 00:28:41,144
不单是衣服
It's not only the dresses.
They wear their hair short, too.

293
00:28:41,214 --> 00:28:42,146
她们也留短衣

294
00:28:42,214 --> 00:28:44,146
短发
Short hair!

295
00:28:44,214 --> 00:28:46,146
就像跟一个男孩睡觉一样
It's like sleeping with a boy!

296
00:28:46,215 --> 00:28:52,149
我们不在时，
女人变得很傻
我担保妻子没有剪短头发
When we're not around,
women act foolish.
I'm sure my wife hasn't cut her hair.

297
00:28:52,218 --> 00:28:57,150
那是高档妓女才干的
你怎样知道的？
That's for high-class floozies.
How would you know,
with that mug?

298
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:10,156
鞋！
它们多小啊！
长袜子
纯丝长袜！
嘿，伙计，
我准备好了！
我们先梦想一下吧
- Shoes!
- How small they are!
Stockings.
Stockings of sheerest silk!
Hey, fellas, I'm ready!
Let us dream a bit first.

299
00:29:10,225 --> 00:29:13,156
你只会捣鬼
You'll only stifle our imagination.

300
00:29:13,226 --> 00:29:19,159
看这个！
黑长袜
Look at that!
Black stockings!

301
00:29:21,535 --> 00:29:23,161
看起来真像个女孩
Looks like a real girl!

302
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:25,468
滑稽吧
Funny, huh?

303
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:30,164
看起来很滑稽吧
Doesn't it look funny?

304
00:29:43,009 --> 00:29:48,170
的确，很滑稽
Yeah, sure looks funny.

305
00:29:59,617 --> 00:30:04,177
可怜的孩子
Poor boys.

306
00:30:30,229 --> 00:30:35,189
玩得尽兴
Enjoy yourselves.

307
00:30:43,261 --> 00:30:47,193
外面孩子与士兵玩呢
Out there, children play soldier...

308
00:30:47,235 --> 00:30:50,635
这里面是士兵像孩子般玩
In here, soldiers play like children.

309
00:30:50,637 --> 00:30:55,196
要知道家里怎样就好了
I wish I knew what's going on
back home.

310
00:30:55,471 --> 00:30:57,205
没新闻？
没有
- No news?
- Nothing.

311
00:30:57,207 --> 00:30:59,738
我不在乎
我的太太在做什么
I don't care what my missus is up to.

312
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:08,203
我想出去，因为我烦透了
烦透了
I want out
'cause I'm bored stiff... bored!

313
00:31:08,377 --> 00:31:12,203
所以你想逃，追求这一乐趣
So you want to escape for the fun ofit.
Right!

314
00:31:12,273 --> 00:31:13,204
对
For me, it's the spirit
of contradiction.

315
00:31:13,274 --> 00:31:15,205
于我而言，是矛盾的精神

316
00:31:15,274 --> 00:31:17,205
他们不让我战斗
They won't let me fiight,
so I'm dying to.

317
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:28,211
我快死了
我讨厌在这儿
这里别人整天与尘土打交道
我可觉简单了
高尔夫球场是打高尔夫球的
网球场是打网球的
I hate being here
when others are biting the dust.
For me it's simple.
A golf course is for golf.
A tennis court for tennis.

318
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:33,211
监狱是用来越逃的
而你，罗斯坦，
是个运动者
A prison camp is for escaping.
And you, Rosenthal, the sportsman...

319
00:31:33,282 --> 00:31:44,216
他？他出生在耶路撒冷
不，是在维也纳，
母亲是丹麦人
父亲是波兰人，
法语说很好
旧时的凯特人贵族
Him? He was born in Jerusalem.
No, in Vienna. To a Danish mother
and a Polish father, naturalized French.
Old Celtic aristocracy!

320
00:31:44,286 --> 00:31:47,217
但你的法国根
Yet for all your French roots, none
of you owns an acre ofyour country.

321
00:31:47,287 --> 00:31:50,285
却没有一寸你国家的土地
In 35 years,
the Rosenthals have acquired

322
00:31:50,287 --> 00:31:53,288
35年内，
罗斯坦一家就获得了
three chateaux with hunting preserves,

323
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:57,821
三个城堡，
兔场，种马饲养场
farms, orchards, warrens, stud farms,

324
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:00,762
还有三个真真的祖先画廊
and 3 galleries of bona fiide ancestors.

325
00:32:00,764 --> 00:32:04,031
那总算值得逃狱了吧
If that's not worth escaping
to fight for!

326
00:32:04,033 --> 00:32:09,226
我倒没想过
爱国主义可这样看
I'd never considered patriotism
from such an unusual angle.

327
00:32:09,295 --> 00:32:11,266
有那些猎场
With all those game preserves,

328
00:32:11,268 --> 00:32:14,367
你的猎狗真得填得满满的
your lackeys must
really stuff themselves.

329
00:32:14,369 --> 00:32:17,202
我很奇怪地就卷入了战争
I got into the war in a funny way.

330
00:32:17,204 --> 00:32:22,231
因为吃素，
我就成了士兵
I became a soldier
because I'm a vegetarian.

331
00:32:22,706 --> 00:32:26,439
不错，我和我妈胃不好
That's right.
My brother and I had stomach ailments.

332
00:32:26,441 --> 00:32:30,207
医生叫我们不要吃肉
The doctor warned us
against eating meat.

333
00:32:30,209 --> 00:32:33,075
我就吃素，长得好好的
I turned vegetarian and got well.

334
00:32:33,077 --> 00:32:35,743
我母亲，继续吃肉
My brother went on eating meat,

335
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:39,376
就病了，接着死掉了
got sick and was invalided out.

336
00:32:39,378 --> 00:32:43,680
你信奉素食主义，
并不是义务所致
Your citations show vegetarianism
didn't interfere with duty.

337
00:32:43,682 --> 00:32:48,241
或者我妻子不再欺骗我
Or stop my wife from cheating on me.

338
00:32:50,518 --> 00:32:55,244
你觉得这很烦人吧
You have to admit it's stirring.

339
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:09,723
我讨厌横留
I loathe fifes.

340
00:33:09,725 --> 00:33:12,624
当然，你听见了嘛
Still, it gets to you.

341
00:33:12,626 --> 00:33:17,252
不是音乐的缘故
It's not the music that gets to you...

342
00:33:17,322 --> 00:33:21,255
是操步的脚
It's the marching feet.

343
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:35,260
真多谢你的废话
我们裤子弄坏了
Thanks to your dumb talk
I ruined my pants...

344
00:33:49,307 --> 00:33:54,897
杜奥蒙特要塞被占领
FORT DOUAUMONT TAKEN!

345
00:34:25,349 --> 00:34:27,280
我们的表演怎样？
What about our show?
Do we still put it on?

346
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:32,282
还要上演吗？
你打赌吧，我们定会上演的
理由充分着呢！
You bet we do!
All the more reason.

347
00:34:32,351 --> 00:34:35,323
事实上我们应该
邀请德军官来看
In fact we should invite
the German Officers.

348
00:34:35,325 --> 00:34:45,288
in your artistic endeavors, Mar閏hal,
尽管我不会加入
到你的表演中去
马利沙
恭贺你，这就是精神
Although I won't join
let me congratulateyou...
That's the spirit!

349
00:35:10,306 --> 00:35:14,366
你们见过玛格丽了吗？
Have you met Marguerite
She's neither tall nor petite

350
00:35:14,368 --> 00:35:15,299
她不高也不娇小
With eyes that glow, skin like snow
And lips in a cupid's bow

351
00:35:15,369 --> 00:35:17,300
眼睛闪亮，皮肤雪白

352
00:35:17,369 --> 00:35:23,302
嘴唇呈弓形
呵，当这神圣的生物
听到我热情的宣言
Well, when this divine creation
Heard my ardent declaration

353
00:35:23,372 --> 00:35:25,304
她给我一朵玫瑰
She gave me a rose, tweaked my nose
Saying, "I'll give you joy"

354
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,304
拧着我鼻子

355
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:27,305
说"我给你快乐"

356
00:35:27,374 --> 00:35:28,305
我说："还是表示感谢"
I said, "Thanks all the same
But that's not why I came"

357
00:35:28,374 --> 00:35:31,305
但那不是我来的原因

358
00:35:31,374 --> 00:35:35,306
如你想给我快乐
If you want to give me joy

359
00:35:35,376 --> 00:35:47,313
玛格丽，玛格丽
如你想给我快乐
让我做给你的爱人
Marguerite, Marguerite
If you want to give me joy
Make me your loverboy

360
00:35:47,382 --> 00:36:05,319
我在她窗下等待
然后我唱小夜曲
"我的灵魂是
坏供燃烧的木料"
因为你们眼睛让我的心着火
所以这甜蜜的可人女子
扑灭我狂怒的火焰
一个桶从她窗台倾泻，问：
"还在燃烧吗？"
'Neath her window I waited
And then I serenaded::
"My soul's apyre
since your eyes set my heart on fire!"
So this sweet and caring dame
To put out my raging flame
Did a bucket spill from her sill
Asking, "Is it burning still?"

361
00:36:05,388 --> 00:36:08,320
我说："还是表示感谢"
I said, "Thanks all the same
But that's not why I came"

362
00:36:08,389 --> 00:36:12,322
但那不是我来的原因

363
00:36:18,298 --> 00:36:20,956
If you want to give me joy

364
00:36:21,167 --> 00:36:24,931
玛格丽，让我做你的情人
Marguerite, let me be your loverboy

365
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:30,329
现在大家一起来
All together now!

366
00:37:02,983 --> 00:37:08,344
现在…从巴黎来的！
And now... direct from Paris!

367
00:38:30,616 --> 00:38:35,378
接住，亚瑟
Get it, Arthur?

368
00:38:44,451 --> 00:38:48,221
停演！停演！
Stop the show! Stop the show!

369
00:38:48,223 --> 00:38:49,956
停止！伙计们
Stop, fellas!

370
00:38:49,958 --> 00:38:53,385
我们又夺回杜奥蒙特
We've retaken Douaumont!
It's in the German papers.

371
00:38:53,453 --> 00:38:57,386
德国报纸上写着呢

372
00:40:23,695 --> 00:40:28,423
一个小洞，用来逃狱的
A little hole, to escape.

373
00:41:08,279 --> 00:41:13,440
德军占领杜奥蒙特
GERMAN TROOPS
RECAPTURE DOUAUMONT

374
00:41:16,381 --> 00:41:18,748
这不是很糟糕吗？
Isn't that awful?

375
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:23,443
有什么可剩下的
Can't be much left of it!

376
00:41:57,526 --> 00:41:59,457
放手
Get off my back!
I can't take it any more! I'm fed up!

377
00:41:59,527 --> 00:42:01,458
我再也受不了啦

378
00:42:01,529 --> 00:42:03,527
我烦透了
I want to see some light!

379
00:42:03,529 --> 00:42:13,463
我要见些光！
这时臭气熏天！
听到吗？这里臭气熏天！
我要听声音
It stinks of shit in here!
Hear me? It stinks of shit!
And I want to hear a voice.

380
00:42:16,972 --> 00:42:22,466
我想听法国话的声音
I want to hear a French voice.

381
00:42:34,541 --> 00:42:38,472
他在叫什么？

382
00:42:40,543 --> 00:42:44,475
这战争大长了！

383
00:42:52,548 --> 00:42:54,478
如果我估计准确

384
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:58,481
我们可在四天后控制花园墙

385
00:43:01,552 --> 00:43:03,482
很多泥啊！

386
00:43:03,552 --> 00:43:07,484
现在我们就要离开这里了

387
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:37,003
What was he yelling about?

388
00:43:39,772 --> 00:43:41,761
The war's too long.

389
00:43:52,509 --> 00:43:54,304
If my calculations are right,

390
00:43:54,477 --> 00:43:58,272
we should be under the garden wall
in four days.

391
00:44:00,245 --> 00:44:02,507
That's a lot of dirt!

392
00:44:02,982 --> 00:44:04,914
Now that we may get away

393
00:44:05,577 --> 00:44:08,507
再次回到家
and reach home again,
I'm afraid of what's waiting for me.

394
00:44:08,578 --> 00:44:09,508
我害怕等着我的东西

395
00:44:09,578 --> 00:44:13,510
天下何处无芳草！
这不适合我
There's more than one woman on earth!
Not for me.

396
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:15,685
这就是她欺骗你的原因
That's why she cheats on you.

397
00:44:15,687 --> 00:44:22,514
leaving Mar閏hal behind.
有一东西，我很担心
把马利沙留在后面
我也觉得沉重
One thing upsets me:
It weighs on me as well.

398
00:44:22,582 --> 00:44:26,515
实际上，这很烦人
In fact... it disturbs me.

399
00:44:26,584 --> 00:44:30,516
但这是战争，
可没感情可言
But that's war. No room for sentiment.

400
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:43,629
老伙计，见到你真好
Glad to seeyou, old man.

401
00:44:43,631 --> 00:44:46,523
我们也是
We are, too.
Wait until you hear why.

402
00:44:46,592 --> 00:44:47,523
等我们告诉你为什么吧
You old dog!

403
00:44:47,592 --> 00:44:53,526
你这老伙计
有没有可以吃的？我饿了
Got anything to eat? I'm hungry.

404
00:44:53,601 --> 00:44:58,527
坐下吧，
罗斯坦在准备点食物
Have a seat.
Rosenthal's getting some grub ready.

405
00:45:05,505 --> 00:45:07,706
几点了？
What time is it?

406
00:45:07,708 --> 00:45:10,273
11点了！
11 o'clock.

407
00:45:10,275 --> 00:45:12,506
今天时间过得很慢
Time's dragging today.

408
00:45:12,508 --> 00:45:16,441
的确，但今晚就是
"再见"（德）了！
Sure, but tonight it's aufwiedersehen!

409
00:45:16,443 --> 00:45:18,475
我们就在亚姆斯特丹碰面？
So, we meet in Amsterdam?

410
00:45:18,477 --> 00:45:21,978
我希望见到荷兰，看郁金香
I'm keen to see Holland,
for the tulips.

411
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:25,605
这些奶酪怎办？
What about the cheese?
Don'tyou like Dutch cheese?

412
00:45:25,607 --> 00:45:36,542
你不喜欢荷兰奶酪吗？
喜欢
但他们说
郁金香地延伸几英里
你骨子里是逛街女孩的东西
Sure, but they say the tulip fiields
stretch for miles.
You have the instincts of a shop girl.

413
00:45:39,685 --> 00:45:41,852
三点集合
Assembly at three o'clock.

414
00:45:41,854 --> 00:45:44,545
所有官员都要挖营
All Officers are to change camps.

415
00:45:44,615 --> 00:45:48,547
准备好东西
Get your things ready.

416
00:46:06,624 --> 00:46:10,129
先生们，旅途愉快
Gentlemen,
I wish you a pleasant journey.

417
00:46:10,131 --> 00:46:15,559
希望你们尽快再见到妻子们
I hope you will see
your wives again soon.

418
00:46:36,508 --> 00:46:40,568
我们在让他们提高警惕
We ought to alert them.

419
00:46:40,636 --> 00:46:44,569
有关那隧道的
About the tunnel.

420
00:46:58,644 --> 00:47:02,577
先生，
在七号营房有一隧道
Sir, there's a tunnel in Barrack 7.

421
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:40,638
把窗开了
这里臭死了
Open the window.
It stinks in here!

422
00:49:47,711 --> 00:49:49,643
长官，我可否指出一下
Sir, may I point out there are
only two pairs of white gloves left.

423
00:49:49,711 --> 00:49:53,711
只剩两对白手套了
We can't get any gloves here.

424
00:49:53,713 --> 00:49:56,712
这里我们得不到手套
Try to make them last.

425
00:49:56,714 --> 00:50:03,647
尽量久用吧
是，长官，还要咖啡吗？
Yes, sir... More coffee, sir?

426
00:50:03,755 --> 00:50:06,716
如果你管这鬼东西叫咖啡
If you call this muck coffee,
I have to accept it.

427
00:50:06,718 --> 00:50:13,652
我认了吧
至少，它令我暖和
At least it warms my insides.

428
00:50:14,721 --> 00:50:18,653
新牢房人员我单，长官
The list of new prisoners, sir.

429
00:51:00,511 --> 00:51:05,672
三我新官员来报到，长官
Three new officer POWs reporting, sir!

430
00:51:11,483 --> 00:51:16,675
很高兴再次见到你，玻狄奥
Delighted to see you again, Boeldieu.

431
00:51:18,746 --> 00:51:21,678
我很抱歉在这里与你会面
But I'm sorry to see you here.

432
00:51:21,747 --> 00:51:25,653
我们也这样认为
We feel the same.

433
00:51:25,655 --> 00:51:28,680
坐下吧，先生们
Sit down, gentlemen.
No, thank you, sir.

434
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:30,681
不坐了，谢谢，长官
As you wish.

435
00:51:30,751 --> 00:51:34,683
随你吧

436
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:44,360
玻狄奥上尉
Captain de Boeldieu,

437
00:51:44,362 --> 00:51:47,594
四次试图越营
four escape attempts:

438
00:51:47,596 --> 00:51:51,765
利用垃圾筒的加热管
Through a heating duct,
in a garbage bin,

439
00:51:51,767 --> 00:51:55,691
利用排水道，在洗衣篮里边
via the sewers,
in a laundry basket.

440
00:51:55,761 --> 00:51:58,692
有时，人须降格一点
One must lower oneself,
at times.

441
00:51:58,762 --> 00:52:00,500
我明白
I understand.

442
00:52:00,502 --> 00:52:07,697
Lieutenant Mar閏hal,
马利沙中校
五次试图越营
伪装成扫烟囱的
five attempts at escape:
Disguised as a chimney sweep...

443
00:52:07,765 --> 00:52:15,700
有改正，长官
是加热工程师
伪装成一我德军士兵
伪装成一我妇女
Correction, sir:
heating engineer.
Disguised as a German soldier,
disguised as a woman.

444
00:52:15,769 --> 00:52:24,770
有趣，真有趣
可当军士想抓住我时，
并不有趣
我不喜欢这个
Amusing, very amusing.
But less so when an NCO
tried to pick me up. That I didn't like!
Indeed?

445
00:52:24,772 --> 00:52:25,703
真的？
I assure you.

446
00:52:25,772 --> 00:52:33,707
我向你保
狄莫得中尉，
三次试图…
Lieutenant Demolder,
three attempts...

447
00:52:36,651 --> 00:52:38,775
先生们，
我对你们的爱国热忱
Gentlemen, I respect
your patriotism and courage.

448
00:52:38,777 --> 00:52:46,711
及勇气表示尊敬
但这里的情形有根本的不同
But the situation
is completely different here.

449
00:52:48,154 --> 00:52:51,987
没人能从这城堡中逃出去
No one escapes from this fortress.

450
00:52:51,989 --> 00:52:55,922
你理解吧？
You understand me, don't you?

451
00:52:55,924 --> 00:52:58,784
所以为了避免受责
So as not to be accused
of German barbarism,

452
00:52:58,786 --> 00:53:06,719
说我滥用德国暴行
我决定施行法军条例
I have decided to apply
French regulations.

453
00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:13,722
仔细阅读一下这个
Look them over.

454
00:53:13,791 --> 00:53:17,724
很好的睡前读物
They make good bedtime reading.

455
00:53:21,566 --> 00:53:26,728
现在，先生们，你们可跟我…
And now, gentlemen,
if you will follow me...

456
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:32,730
奥思瓦，我的大衣
Oswald! My coat.

457
00:53:47,543 --> 00:53:49,710
我这些士兵不年轻了
My soldiers aren't young,

458
00:53:49,712 --> 00:53:54,738
但他们很会玩这个
but they enjoy playing soldier.

459
00:54:13,816 --> 00:54:17,748
我们还有多25支这样的枪
We have 25 more guns like this one.

460
00:54:18,817 --> 00:54:22,057
我想你们知道
这马克沁机枪吧？
I suppose you know the Maxim gun?

461
00:54:22,059 --> 00:54:25,324
很了解，长官
Very well, sir.

462
00:54:25,326 --> 00:54:30,753
但我较中意饭馆
But I prefer the restaurant.
Touch?

463
00:54:33,823 --> 00:54:35,754
我倒想起十五岁时
识的一个女孩

464
00:54:35,825 --> 00:54:39,757
她叫菲菲

465
00:54:39,825 --> 00:54:43,757
她死了？

466
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:51,761
十二世纪
12th century.

467
00:55:02,074 --> 00:55:04,305
对不起，长官！
Excuse me, sir...

468
00:55:04,307 --> 00:55:08,767
这小屋是否为
玻狄奥上尉和我特制的？
Was this villa built specially
for Captain de Boeldieu and myself?

469
00:55:10,837 --> 00:55:14,770
只有我们才是你的世界？
Are we your only boarders?

470
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:20,773
不，你的同志在那后面
Your comrades are back there.

471
00:55:24,416 --> 00:55:25,642
1 3th century.

472
00:55:30,845 --> 00:55:34,777
十三世纪

473
00:55:43,523 --> 00:55:47,783
有120英尺高
A 1 20-foot drop.

474
00:55:47,853 --> 00:55:51,785
谢谢你带我们参观这里
So kind of you
to show us around the grounds.

475
00:55:52,659 --> 00:55:56,527
这城堡很好，长官
It's such a nice castle, sir.

476
00:55:56,529 --> 00:56:00,962
它如此老了…
It's so old...

477
00:56:00,964 --> 00:56:05,791
如此激奋人心
And so cheerful.

478
00:56:11,863 --> 00:56:16,766
抱歉不能给你自己一间房
Sorry I can't give you
a room to yourself.

479
00:56:16,935 --> 00:56:22,797
我很感动，但…
我永远不会接受
I'm touched,
but I'd never have accepted.

480
00:56:23,772 --> 00:56:27,039
但愿这次步行没有累着你
I hope our walk
didn't weary you too much.

481
00:56:27,041 --> 00:56:31,800
没有，长官，我们挺好的
Not at all, sir, we're fiine.

482
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:46,806
十四世纪    纯哥特式的
- 14th century.
- Pure Gothic.

483
00:56:46,875 --> 00:56:49,779
先生们，如不介意…
Ifyou don't mind, gentlemen...

484
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:53,877
你们的朋友罗斯坦中尉
Your friend Lt. Rosenthal,
from the Hallbach camp, is here.

485
00:56:53,879 --> 00:57:04,812
从哈巴赫来的，在这里
哦，老罗斯坦！
他一样不走运
指挥官将你们都放进同一间
- Not old Rosenthal!
- He wasn't any luckier.
The commandant has put you all
in the same room.

486
00:57:04,882 --> 00:57:12,817
这样你们吃得好些
他真不赖
That way you'll eat better.
That's very nice of him.

487
00:57:12,885 --> 00:57:16,818
只是个形式而已
A mere formality.

488
00:57:27,899 --> 00:57:29,890
我跟一个浅黑女子捉获的
- I caught it with a brunette.
- Who can you trust?

489
00:57:29,892 --> 00:57:38,895
你可信谁啊！
是我母亲的一个朋友
很值得尊敬，
做慈善工作的
好社会里边，
它通常表现为天花
A friend of my mother's.
Quite respectable. She did charity work.
In good society it's usually the pox.
Right, Boeldieu?

490
00:57:38,897 --> 00:57:39,828
对吧，玻狄奥？
The pox used to be our privilege.
But we've lost it.

491
00:57:39,897 --> 00:57:41,828
天花曾是我们的特权

492
00:57:41,897 --> 00:57:44,896
但我们已丢掉它了
Like so many others.

493
00:57:44,898 --> 00:57:46,897
跟许多其他东西一样
Everything is popularized.

494
00:57:46,899 --> 00:57:48,830
什么东西都变得大众化了
Cancer and gout
aren't working-class diseases,

495
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:52,899
癌与痛风并非工人阶级病
but they will be, believe me.

496
00:57:52,901 --> 00:57:54,899
但会是的，信我吧
How about intellectuals?

497
00:57:54,901 --> 00:57:56,901
那知识分子呢？
With us it's tuberculosis.

498
00:57:56,903 --> 00:57:58,901
我们的是肺炎
Here's Mr. Pindar.

499
00:57:58,903 --> 00:58:00,902
平达先生来了
And the middle class?

500
00:58:00,904 --> 00:58:04,836
和中产阶级？
肝，肠脆弱
Liver and intestinal ailments...
They eat too much.

501
00:58:04,906 --> 00:58:05,837
他们吃得太多了
We'd each die
ofour own class diseases,

502
00:58:05,906 --> 00:58:08,906
我们会死得其所的
if war didn't make all germs equal.

503
00:58:08,908 --> 00:58:11,907
如果战争没有创造出平等
Your dictionaries are in myway.

504
00:58:11,909 --> 00:58:14,907
你的字典挡着我了
Excuse me,

505
00:58:14,909 --> 00:58:16,839
不好意思
but Pindar has always been
so badly translated.

506
00:58:16,911 --> 00:58:51,854
但平达总是被译得这么差
真值得哀悼
我真抱歉
我也不在意
但这平达是何人？
继续玩笑！
但平达对我至关重要…
比你重要，在战争，
我的一生！
平达是最伟大的希腊诗人
最伟大的希腊诗人？
你不是说…
看！我的图画马上就好了
看，这是我们所在地…
A lamentable oversight.
I'm so sorry.
Not that I care,
but who's this guy Pindar?
Go on,joke! But Pindar
means more to me than anything...
More than you, the war, my life!
Pindar is the greatest Greek poet.
The greatest Greek poet?
You don't say...
There! My map'sjust about finished.
See... this is where we are...

507
00:58:51,998 --> 00:58:54,697
这弯口上16英里处，
位于梅思河
16 miles above this bend
in the Main River.

508
00:58:54,699 --> 00:58:58,163
到达康斯坦湖上的瑞士
To reach Switzerland
above Lake Constance

509
00:58:58,165 --> 00:59:00,926
避开莱因河
and avoid the Rhine,
we'd have to travel...

510
00:59:00,928 --> 00:59:03,927
我们得走过…
- 200 miles.
- No kidding!

511
00:59:03,929 --> 00:59:31,870
200英里！
不是开玩笑！
这意味着走15夜
每天只吃6块糖，
2块饼干
你和你的地图
你就跟他和他们的平达
一样疯狂
逃营…
这里，图画画完了！
"公正搜寻罪恶"
还可以吧
看，要到这康斯坦…
That means walking 15 nights on 6 lumps
of sugar and 2 biscuits a day.
You and your map, you're as crazy
as him and his Pindar. To escape...
There! My picture's finished.
"Justice Pursuing Crime."
It came out all right.
Look, to reach this Constance place...

512
00:59:35,714 --> 00:59:37,746
它靠得住吗？
Will it hold?

513
00:59:37,748 --> 00:59:42,848
它可耐10个你和5个像我的人
It can hold 10 of you and 5 like me.

514
00:59:42,850 --> 00:59:47,877
他们在检查房间！
They're searching the rooms!

515
00:59:48,486 --> 00:59:50,945
放到毯下面，快点！
- Under the mattress, quick!
- No, under mine!

516
00:59:50,947 --> 00:59:52,946
放到矿上面
That won't do.

517
00:59:52,948 --> 00:59:54,947
这不行
It's childish.

518
00:59:54,949 --> 01:00:00,881
这真幼稚
我可以拿吗？
May I?

519
01:00:07,428 --> 01:00:09,885
我有个主意
Now there's an idea!
A convenient little gutter.

520
01:00:09,955 --> 01:00:13,886
小条便利的水槽

521
01:00:13,897 --> 01:00:18,889
他们来了
Here they are!

522
01:00:19,266 --> 01:00:23,890
先生们，查房！
Gentlemen... inspection.

523
01:00:32,538 --> 01:00:34,569
"路易写给维克多："
"Louise wrote to Victor:

524
01:00:34,571 --> 01:00:37,963
"经22个爱之夜后"
I am as weary as a girl
after 22 nights oflove."

525
01:00:37,965 --> 01:00:45,899
"我像女孩般倦怠"
22个爱之夜，想一想！
22 nights oflove, imagine that!

526
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:16,577
Continue!

527
01:01:16,981 --> 01:01:20,912
继续查！

528
01:01:23,591 --> 01:01:28,916
不是那角落
Not that corner!

529
01:01:32,427 --> 01:01:35,986
向我保
Give me your word that you've nothing
in here against regulations.

530
01:01:35,988 --> 01:01:39,988
人们这里没有违规的东西
You have my word.

531
01:01:39,990 --> 01:01:45,923
我向你保
但为什么要我保  ，
而非他们的？
But why my word and not theirs?

532
01:01:45,933 --> 01:01:50,924
别人的保
The word of a...
Rosenthal...

533
01:01:51,994 --> 01:01:52,926
像罗斯坦…
and a Mar閏hal?

534
01:01:52,994 --> 01:01:55,993
和马利沙的？
It's as good as ours.

535
01:01:55,995 --> 01:01:59,928
他们的跟我们的一样
Perhaps.

536
01:01:59,998 --> 01:02:03,930
或许如此吧

537
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:10,240
不，不要这样
No, not that!

538
01:02:10,242 --> 01:02:14,935
这很稀有的
It's very rare.

539
01:02:24,582 --> 01:02:28,480
可怜的老平达！
Poor old Pindar!

540
01:02:28,482 --> 01:02:32,941
他们真是十足的傻瓜
They really are stupid.

541
01:02:46,623 --> 01:02:50,156
这里一切安好？
Everything go all right in here?

542
01:02:50,158 --> 01:02:54,950
还不赖
我们的也是
- Not bad.
- For us, too.

543
01:03:11,432 --> 01:03:14,464
你的表兄，
埃蒙得玻狄奥怎样了？
And how is your cousin,
Edmond de Boeldieu,

544
01:03:14,466 --> 01:03:17,701
我在柏林碰见的武官？
the military attach?I met in Berlin?

545
01:03:17,703 --> 01:03:19,834
他干得不赖，他很快活
He's doing well. He's very happy.

546
01:03:19,836 --> 01:03:22,970
他丢了条手臂，
娶了有钱女人
He lost an arm
and married a rich woman.

547
01:03:22,972 --> 01:03:27,964
真不赖
A truly fine career.

548
01:03:34,441 --> 01:03:35,667
Recognize her?

549
01:03:36,035 --> 01:03:39,967
认得她吗？

550
01:03:40,037 --> 01:03:41,968
当然认得

551
01:03:42,037 --> 01:03:42,968
1919年在利物浦
我们曾一起骑马来着

552
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:45,970
我还记得呢
Sit down.

553
01:03:46,039 --> 01:03:47,970
坐下吧
Let me tell you something...

554
01:03:48,039 --> 01:03:51,972
我跟你说点话
相信我
Believe me,

555
01:03:52,041 --> 01:03:56,974
我现在的作用
我感到极为反感
my present functions
revolt me as much as they do you.

556
01:03:57,044 --> 01:03:58,975
跟你们感觉一样
That's being harsh.

557
01:03:59,044 --> 01:03:59,975
那太辛苦了
I used to be a combatant.

558
01:04:00,044 --> 01:04:06,978
我曾是个战士
我现在是个官僚，
一个警察
Now I'm a bureaucrat, a policeman.

559
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:10,055
但只有这条路
But it's the only way

560
01:04:10,057 --> 01:04:13,155
我可以看起来仍显得…
I can still appear to be

561
01:04:13,157 --> 01:04:17,823
效忠于我的祖国
serving my fatherland.

562
01:04:17,825 --> 01:04:21,051
我烧掉了所有的东西
I have burns all over...
That explains my gloves.

563
01:04:21,053 --> 01:04:24,052
你明白手套的事了吧
My spine is fractured in two places.

564
01:04:24,054 --> 01:04:28,053
我脊柱有两处破裂了
A silver plate.

565
01:04:28,055 --> 01:04:31,055
一块银色的碟子
In my kneecap, too.

566
01:04:31,057 --> 01:04:36,056
也在我的膝盖骨里边
I owe these riches
to the misfortunes ofwar.

567
01:04:36,058 --> 01:04:40,058
我将这归咎于战争的不幸
- May I ask you a question?
- Of course.

568
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:45,060
我可以问你一个问题吗？
问吧
Why did you make

569
01:04:45,062 --> 01:04:47,061
为什么你使得…
an exception ofme

570
01:04:47,063 --> 01:04:49,994
我成为一个例外
by inviting me here?

571
01:04:50,065 --> 01:05:09,070
将我邀请来这儿呢？
因为你叫玻狄奥
是法军中的职业军官
而我是劳芬斯坦
是德帝国军队的职业军官
但我的同志也是军官
A Mar閏hal and a Rosenthal, Officers?
马利沙和罗斯坦，军官？
Because your name is Boeldieu,
career offiicer in the French Army.
And I am Rauffenstein, career offiicer
in the German Imperial Army.
But my comrades are Officers, as well.
They're fine soldiers.

572
01:05:09,072 --> 01:05:10,003
他们是好兵士
Charming legacy
of the French Revolution.

573
01:05:10,073 --> 01:05:15,072
这法国革命的遗产真迷人
Neither you nor I
can stop the march of time.

574
01:05:15,074 --> 01:05:19,074
你我都不能阻住时间步伐
Boeldieu...

575
01:05:19,076 --> 01:05:21,007
玻狄奥…
I don't know who will win this war,

576
01:05:21,077 --> 01:05:24,075
我不知谁会打赢这局战争
but whatever the outcome,

577
01:05:24,077 --> 01:05:40,014
但无论结果如何
但意味着
劳芬斯坦和玻狄奥的…
完结
不再有人需要我们
这难道不可惜吗？
可能吧
it will mean the end of
the Rauffensteins and the Boeldieus.
We're no longer needed.
Isn't that a pity?
Perhaps.

578
01:05:40,291 --> 01:05:43,458
我欣赏你照料天竺葵的方式
I admire the way
you tend your geranium.

579
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:47,559
不要以为我成了植物学家
Don't think I've become a botanist,

580
01:05:47,561 --> 01:05:52,627
但它是城堡里唯一的花
but it's the only flower
in the fortress.

581
01:05:52,629 --> 01:05:58,021
这里除了常春藤和麻，
什么也不长
Nothing grows here but ivy and nettles.

582
01:05:58,091 --> 01:06:00,229
很高兴我能跟你们一起走
I'm glad I'm leaving with you.

583
01:06:00,231 --> 01:06:01,798
跟我们
With us.

584
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:07,665
的确，我喜欢玻狄奥，
但是…
Sure, I like Boeldieu, but...
With him...

585
01:06:08,095 --> 01:06:10,094
和他…
I never really feel at ease.

586
01:06:10,096 --> 01:06:14,095
我从未感到轻松过
Different backgrounds...
There's a wall between us.

587
01:06:14,097 --> 01:06:17,097
背景不同，
我们之间隔着堵墙
He's a terrifiic guy.

588
01:06:17,099 --> 01:06:19,097
他棒极了
Sure, and he's on the level, but...

589
01:06:19,099 --> 01:06:22,098
唔，他坦率，
但是…
Suppose you and I were on the skids.

590
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:26,100
假如我和你同在滑橇上
We'd just be two bums.

591
01:06:26,102 --> 01:06:27,033
我们只能是叫化子
If it happened to him,

592
01:06:27,103 --> 01:06:29,101
如果变做他如此
he'd still be " Monsieur de Boeldieu."

593
01:06:29,103 --> 01:06:33,102
他仍会是：玻狄奥先生
Anyway, you've been terrifiic, too,

594
01:06:33,104 --> 01:06:35,103
无论怎样，你也很棒
feeding us with your parcels.

595
01:06:35,105 --> 01:06:38,105
能用你的包裹执行我们
That's all vanity.

596
01:06:38,107 --> 01:06:40,106
只是虚荣罢了
I'm really proud to come
from a rich family.

597
01:06:40,108 --> 01:06:43,106
我很得意我家里富裕
Inviting you to my table
is myway ofshowing it.

598
01:06:43,108 --> 01:06:47,109
邀你吃饭，
我就可让你知道了
Most people think we're stingy.

599
01:06:47,111 --> 01:06:50,109
很多人以为我吝啬
Wrong. We're often generous.

600
01:06:50,111 --> 01:06:52,110
错了，我们常显得大方
Unfortunately, along with that quality,

601
01:06:52,112 --> 01:06:55,112
很不幸，
却带上了那东西
Jehovah gave us an overdose of pride.

602
01:06:55,114 --> 01:06:58,113
约赫华太过纵容我们自大了
To hell with Jehovah!

603
01:06:58,115 --> 01:07:05,048
约赫华去死吧
我只知道你是个好伙计
All I know is you've been a real pal.

604
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:11,125
我们收到一个大柳条箱
We've received a large crate,

605
01:07:11,127 --> 01:07:14,359
是我们女沙皇的礼物
a gift from our Czarina.

606
01:07:14,361 --> 01:07:17,361
来，我们一起分享
Please come and share it with us.

607
01:07:17,363 --> 01:07:20,597
女沙皇的礼物？
肯定是鱼子酱
From the Czarina? Must be caviar.

608
01:07:20,599 --> 01:07:24,086
玻狄奥，你也来吧？
他们有伏特加
- Coming, Boeldieu? They've got vodka.
- Vodka? Lead on.

609
01:07:24,124 --> 01:07:28,057
伏特加？带路

610
01:07:29,267 --> 01:07:32,968
现在我们补偿你全盘好意了
Now we can pay you back
for all your kindness.

611
01:07:32,970 --> 01:07:37,001
女沙皇总是好心肠
The Czarina is always good-hearted.

612
01:07:37,003 --> 01:07:42,062
你的女沙皇，
好一位女士
Quite a lady, your Czarina.

613
01:07:57,345 --> 01:08:02,070
猜里面有什么！
Think of what's in store!

614
01:08:16,052 --> 01:08:20,185
"代数学原理"…
"道德基础"…"语法"
"Principles ofAlgebra"...
"Elementary Ethics"... "Grammar"...

615
01:08:20,187 --> 01:08:21,820
烹调书
A cook book!

616
01:08:21,822 --> 01:08:24,819
什么老掉牙的书啊
Something to sink your teeth into!

617
01:08:24,821 --> 01:08:26,687
这是什么日子啊
What a farce!

618
01:08:26,689 --> 01:08:29,321
趁没发生什么，我们还是走吧
Let's go before something happens.

619
01:08:29,323 --> 01:08:34,083
再见，不过还是感谢了
Goodbye, thanks anyway.

620
01:08:52,734 --> 01:08:58,093
哥萨克人来劲了
我们快离开这儿！
- The Cossacks aren't happy!
- Let's get out of here!

621
01:09:01,163 --> 01:09:03,234
你没权烧书
You have no right to burn books!

622
01:09:03,236 --> 01:09:08,096
给我们送书，
真是疯了
It's crazy sending us books!

623
01:09:21,171 --> 01:09:23,576
哨兵正忙着对付俄国人呢
The sentries are busy with the Russians.

624
01:09:23,578 --> 01:09:26,479
这里下去挺久的，
但没哨兵
It's a long drop here,
but it's unguarded.

625
01:09:26,481 --> 01:09:28,172
我们要是准备好，
就可以逃了
If only we'd been ready!
What a chance!

626
01:09:28,174 --> 01:09:33,106
多好的机会
特别是晚上
- Especially at night!
- We'll try again.

627
01:09:33,175 --> 01:09:53,149
我们再试一次
他们预先给我们排练了一下
太好了
现在我们知道
一个人可担搁他们五分钟
他的同志就可逃跑了
太危险了！
你在夸大其辞
我会觉得有趣的
It was kind ofthem
to hold a rehearsal for us.
Now we know if one man
can divert them for 5 minutes,
his comrades can escape.
- Too risky!
- You're exaggerating.
It would amuse me.
When do you want to go?

628
01:09:53,183 --> 01:09:58,115
你什么时候想走？
为什么我们？
你也在我们之列？
Why us? You're in it, too.

629
01:09:58,186 --> 01:10:00,184
不
Why not? Don't you trust us?

630
01:10:00,186 --> 01:10:04,185
为什么？
你不相信我们？
- That wouldn't stop me.
- Well then?

631
01:10:04,187 --> 01:10:07,187
不是这个
那是什么？
A plan like yours
can only work with two men.

632
01:10:07,189 --> 01:10:10,189
你的计划只够两个人用
And I know your preference.

633
01:10:10,191 --> 01:10:14,122
而我知道你的喜好
这不公平
- It's not fair.
- What's fair in war?

634
01:10:14,191 --> 01:10:15,122
战时讲什么公平？
We can't accept that.

635
01:10:15,191 --> 01:10:17,191
我们不能接受
I'm not asking you...

636
01:10:17,193 --> 01:10:20,124
我不是问你…
I'm telling you.

637
01:10:20,194 --> 01:10:23,193
我在告诉你
The arts aren't forbidden here.

638
01:10:23,195 --> 01:10:26,195
这里不禁止艺
You like music?

639
01:10:26,197 --> 01:10:27,128
你喜欢音乐？
So-so... I like a good waltz.

640
01:10:27,197 --> 01:10:30,196
一般…
我喜欢好的华尔兹
I love the flute.

641
01:10:30,198 --> 01:10:31,130
我喜爱长笛
Here's the program:
We buy flutes for everyone.

642
01:10:31,198 --> 01:10:33,130
这是计划

643
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:35,198
我们给每人都买一长笛
On the given day:
concert in all the rooms at 5 p.m.

644
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:39,199
特定的一天：
下午五点房间音乐会
That's when night falls.

645
01:10:39,201 --> 01:10:41,200
那时天黑了
Five minutes later,
they confiiscate our flutes.

646
01:10:41,202 --> 01:10:45,134
五分钟后，
他没收了笛子
At 5:1 5,

647
01:10:45,204 --> 01:10:46,135
五点15分时
another concert
with anything at hand:

648
01:10:46,204 --> 01:10:50,204
另一个音乐会，
什么拿来用了
saucepans, animal noises,

649
01:10:50,206 --> 01:10:52,204
平底锅，动物噪声
grinding teeth, whatever...

650
01:10:52,206 --> 01:10:56,207
磨牙，什么都有
Result: assembly in the courtyard.

651
01:10:56,209 --> 01:10:59,207
结果：庭院里集体
Then what?

652
01:10:59,209 --> 01:11:05,141
然后怎样？
这是我关心的问题
That's my concern.
You'll have fiive minutes...

653
01:11:05,212 --> 01:11:09,144
你清洁墙壁和到林子那里
to clear the walls and reach the woods.

654
01:11:09,586 --> 01:11:11,211
Look, Boeldieu,

655
01:11:11,214 --> 01:11:15,214
看，玻狄奥
我不知道该怎么说
I don't know how to put it,
but I feel awful about this.

656
01:11:15,216 --> 01:11:17,148
但我感到这可怕
- Come now!
- Yes, awful.

657
01:11:17,216 --> 01:11:21,149
振作点  真的，很可怕

658
01:11:21,524 --> 01:11:24,150
我想说点什么…
I'd like to say something...
Pour some warm water
over my gloves, will you?

659
01:11:24,219 --> 01:11:28,151
倒点热水到我手套上，好吗？

660
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:32,220
无论发生什么事情
Whatever happens,
I want you to know that...

661
01:11:32,222 --> 01:11:34,221
我想，你知道…
I'm not doing this for you personally.

662
01:11:34,223 --> 01:11:38,222
我不是为你私人效劳
So we needn't get mawkish.

663
01:11:38,224 --> 01:11:42,157
所以我们不必假作多情
Go on.

664
01:11:42,227 --> 01:11:44,226
再多点
But there are times in life...

665
01:11:44,228 --> 01:11:46,227
但有时生命中有…
Let's avoid them, shall we?

666
01:11:46,229 --> 01:11:50,860
避开它们，可以吧？
Excuse me...

667
01:11:51,229 --> 01:11:55,161
失陪…

668
01:12:00,573 --> 01:12:02,905
你就戴这些？
So you'll be wearing those?

669
01:12:02,907 --> 01:12:05,167
有何意见！？
Any objections?
No, but white gloves
for this sort of thing, what an idea!

670
01:12:05,236 --> 01:12:06,167
没有

671
01:12:06,236 --> 01:12:14,170
但戴白手套做这事，真不赖
每人风格不同
To each his own style.

672
01:12:14,445 --> 01:12:18,279
2你不能像其他人一样做事
You can't do anything
like other people.

673
01:12:18,281 --> 01:12:21,212
我们已呆在一起有18个月了
We've been together
eighteen months,

674
01:12:21,214 --> 01:12:23,248
你还是那么客气
and you still stand on ceremony.

675
01:12:23,250 --> 01:12:28,176
我跟母亲，妻子一样的
I'm the same with my mother
and my wife.

676
01:12:29,251 --> 01:12:33,651
这样的话…
In that case...

677
01:12:33,653 --> 01:12:38,120
不，谢了，
我喉咙不习惯英国烟草
No thanks, English tobacco
gives me a sore throat.

678
01:12:38,122 --> 01:12:41,920
没错：手套，烟草…
No doubt about it: gloves, tobacco...

679
01:12:41,922 --> 01:12:47,155
我们没有共通点
We've got nothing in common.

680
01:12:47,157 --> 01:12:49,591
随所欲言吧
Say what you like,

681
01:12:49,593 --> 01:12:54,186
但那里有德国人，
哪里就有秩序
but where there are Germans,
there is order.

682
01:12:54,427 --> 01:12:57,160
没错，那老伙计有点疯了
Sure, the old man is a bit mad

683
01:12:57,162 --> 01:12:59,928
带着他的花盘，
和所有的…
with his flower pot and all...

684
01:12:59,930 --> 01:13:02,256
我在这里的好处之一
A good thing I'm here
to keep those scoundrels in check.

685
01:13:02,258 --> 01:13:09,190
就是时时督查那些坏分子
在家我是个教师
I was a teacher back home.

686
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:31,199
中尉，
马上没收那些该死的笛子！
Lieutenant, confiscate
those damned flutes at once!

687
01:14:42,038 --> 01:14:45,136
你们最好不要再搞
I advise you not to start again!

688
01:14:45,138 --> 01:14:50,232
15分钟后，我们偏要搞
We'll do just that in 15 minutes.

689
01:15:01,378 --> 01:15:07,237
命令已执行，长官
Order executed, sir.

690
01:15:13,149 --> 01:15:16,715
看到了吧？它发生作用呢？
You see? It worked.

691
01:15:16,717 --> 01:15:22,118
三天内只给面包和水他们吃
Put them on bread and water
for three days. And no parcels.

692
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:27,244
准备，伙计们，两秒…
Ready, boys... Two seconds...

693
01:16:39,017 --> 01:16:44,275
集合！
Assembly!

694
01:16:44,418 --> 01:16:47,276
我现明白我的学生了
真吵
I understand my students now.
What a lark!

695
01:16:47,346 --> 01:16:51,277
还吵这么久！
While it lasts.

696
01:16:51,854 --> 01:16:53,376
Well...

697
01:16:54,589 --> 01:16:59,281
什么？
What?
Goodbye.

698
01:16:59,351 --> 01:17:03,282
再见了

699
01:17:56,180 --> 01:17:57,371
Boeldieu!

700
01:17:57,375 --> 01:18:01,306
玻狄奥
De Boeldieu!

701
01:18:01,376 --> 01:18:05,307
玻狄奥！

702
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:40,415
听着！
求你了，下来！
Listen!
I beg you! Come down!

703
01:22:47,487 --> 01:22:49,418
你真的变疯了？

704
01:22:49,488 --> 01:22:50,419
我清醒得很

705
01:22:50,488 --> 01:22:54,420
玻狄奥，玻狄奥！

706
01:22:55,490 --> 01:22:56,421
你明白吗？

707
01:22:56,490 --> 01:22:59,422
如果你不服从我的命令

708
01:22:59,491 --> 01:23:02,423
我得开枪了

709
01:23:02,493 --> 01:23:06,425
我抱歉我要这样做！

710
01:23:12,496 --> 01:23:14,427
下来吧

711
01:23:14,498 --> 01:23:16,429
去死吧

712
01:23:16,499 --> 01:23:20,432
我才不理呢

713
01:23:39,314 --> 01:23:44,440
Lieutenants Mar閏hal and Rosenthal
马利沙中尉和罗斯坦逃跑了
have escaped.

714
01:23:51,987 --> 01:23:57,445
原来是这回事
So that's why.

715
01:23:57,514 --> 01:24:00,587
探照灯
Search lights!

716
01:24:00,589 --> 01:24:03,489
派出巡逻队，带狗！
Send out patrols with dogs!

717
01:24:03,491 --> 01:24:07,656
所有军事，
民事机构提高警惕！
Alert all military
and civil authorities!

718
01:24:07,658 --> 01:24:12,451
每刻钟向我报告情况！
Report back to me every quarter hour!

719
01:24:58,538 --> 01:25:01,469
你命令已传下去，长官
Your orders have been carried out, sir.

720
01:25:01,540 --> 01:25:05,472
目前没有逃犯踪迹
No sign of the fugitives yet.

721
01:25:45,931 --> 01:25:50,489
原谅我
Forgive me.

722
01:25:50,559 --> 01:25:53,032
换了我，我也会这样做的
I would have done the same.

723
01:25:53,034 --> 01:25:57,492
法国人或德国人，
责任是责任啊
French or German, duty is duty.

724
01:25:59,837 --> 01:26:03,495
你痛吗？
Are you in pain?

725
01:26:03,564 --> 01:26:07,497
肚子中了弹并不怎么伤人
I didn't think
a bullet in the stomach hurt so much.

726
01:26:07,565 --> 01:26:11,498
我瞄准的是你的腿
I aimed at your legs.

727
01:26:12,041 --> 01:26:16,499
有500英尺，视野又暗…
It was 500 feet, with poor visibility...

728
01:26:17,044 --> 01:26:20,501
再说，我还在跑
Besides, I was running.

729
01:26:20,571 --> 01:26:23,502
不要这样，没有藉口的
Please, no excuses.

730
01:26:23,571 --> 01:26:27,504
我笨手笨脚的
I was clumsy.

731
01:26:28,574 --> 01:26:32,507
并不是我要受人怜悯
I'm not the one to be pitied.

732
01:26:32,575 --> 01:26:35,506
我们一切都要完了…
For me it will all be over...

733
01:26:35,577 --> 01:26:38,508
很快！
soon.

734
01:26:38,578 --> 01:26:42,510
但你还要继续走
But you'll have to carry on.

735
01:26:42,579 --> 01:26:46,511
继续行尸走肉的生活
Carry on a futile existence.

736
01:26:50,582 --> 01:26:54,515
普通人死于战争是悲剧
For a commoner,
dying in a war is a tragedy.

737
01:26:55,585 --> 01:26:59,517
但你和我
But for you and me,

738
01:27:00,586 --> 01:27:03,517
这是条好路子
it's a good way out.

739
01:27:03,587 --> 01:27:07,519
我错失了机会
I missed my chance.

740
01:27:08,589 --> 01:27:12,521
你不能说太多话的
You shouldn't be talking so much.

741
01:27:34,875 --> 01:27:39,533
长官
Sir...

742
01:29:21,650 --> 01:29:25,484
我们应避开大路的
We should've avoided the road.

743
01:29:25,486 --> 01:29:29,574
我们不能睡在野草里
We couldn't sleep in the reeds.

744
01:29:29,645 --> 01:29:32,576
他走了
He's gone.

745
01:29:32,646 --> 01:29:34,578
难道你没看见它是个女人？
Didn't you see it was a woman?

746
01:29:34,646 --> 01:29:35,578
继续走吧
- Let's get going.
- Wait till dark.

747
01:29:35,647 --> 01:29:41,580
等到天黑再走
冷死了，我得动一动
I'm freezing, I have to move.

748
01:29:52,029 --> 01:29:56,028
要你的糖吗？
Want your sugar?

749
01:29:56,030 --> 01:29:57,861
没剩多少了
There's not much left.

750
01:29:57,863 --> 01:29:59,664
我们还有很长一段路走呢
And we've a long way to go.

751
01:29:59,666 --> 01:30:04,589
你呢？
我吃我的，我饿了
- What about you?
- I ate mine, I was hungry.

752
01:30:04,659 --> 01:30:21,597
你拿着吧，
这样我不至于谗嘴
可怜的东西…
你连纽扣也吃了？
看得出来吗？
那我们不待天黑啦？
我们先沿着村庄走
You keep it, so I won't be tempted.
You poor thing...
You ate your buttons, too?
Does it show?
So we're not waiting till dark?
No, we'll skirt the village fiirst.

753
01:30:22,665 --> 01:30:28,599
你的腿伤了？
无大碍，没什么…
有点僵硬
Your foot hurt?
It's nothing... a nerve.

754
01:30:47,916 --> 01:30:49,074
Let's go.

755
01:30:49,677 --> 01:30:53,609
走吧

756
01:30:56,679 --> 01:31:00,611
你来吗？
You coming?

757
01:31:23,690 --> 01:31:27,622
你来还是怎么样？
You coming or what?

758
01:31:31,692 --> 01:31:35,625
我在尽力呢
I'm doing the best I can.

759
01:31:48,707 --> 01:31:50,630
你和你的脚！
You and your foot!

760
01:31:50,700 --> 01:31:52,631
不是我的错，我摔倒了
It's not my fault! I slipped.

761
01:31:52,701 --> 01:31:54,774
你摔倒了！我只知道这个
You slipped! That's all I hear.

762
01:31:54,776 --> 01:31:58,634
若你导致我们被抓
你就说你摔倒了？
If you get us caught,
you'll explain you slipped?

763
01:31:58,703 --> 01:32:05,637
我们没食物了，
也没力气了
还好，我已经够了
受够我了？
We're out offood.
Might as well give up now.
- Gladly. I've had enough too.
- Had enough ofme?

764
01:32:05,707 --> 01:32:06,638
肯定是，你知道
Damn right! If you only knew
how you make me sick!

765
01:32:06,706 --> 01:32:12,638
我被你搞得很惨
呵，这感觉大家都一样
Well, the feeling's mutual.

766
01:32:12,709 --> 01:32:23,645
你是个累赘，
绑人的锁链
我从来受不了犹太人！
意识到这点有点晚了
很明显，你要死了
你说好！
You're a dead weight,
a ball and chain.
I never could stomach Jews!
A bit late to realize that!
Clear out, you're dying too.
You said it!

767
01:32:23,714 --> 01:32:26,645
迷路！
我讨厌你这丑八怪！
Get lost! I'm sick ofyour ugly mug!

768
01:32:26,715 --> 01:32:29,646
我走了！
你好自为之吧，再见！
I'm going! You're on your own now!
So long!

769
01:32:29,716 --> 01:32:31,647
再见！走吧
So long! Go ahead!

770
01:32:31,716 --> 01:32:42,651
我如此高兴，
我可唱歌…
从前有一条小蒸汽船
它从没去过海洋
I'm so happy I could sing...
There once was a little steamboat
Which had ne-ne-nevergone to sea

771
01:32:43,596 --> 01:32:48,653
海上五至六周后
After five or six weeks at sea

772
01:32:49,130 --> 01:32:53,655
供给几乎用尽…
The supplies
we real-al-almost gone for good...

773
01:33:10,507 --> 01:33:15,171
你为什么回来？
Why'd you come back?

774
01:33:15,173 --> 01:33:19,665
来吧
Come on.

775
01:33:24,112 --> 01:33:28,668
走吧，伙计
Let's go, fella.

776
01:33:40,650 --> 01:33:42,917
够了吧？
还好
- Had enough?
- It's okay.

777
01:33:42,919 --> 01:33:45,743
想去哪树底休息会吗？
- Want to rest in that shed there?
- Too risky.

778
01:33:45,745 --> 01:33:49,676
太冒险了
没有烟啊
这样也不行…
- I can't see any smoke.
- Even so...

779
01:33:49,747 --> 01:33:59,681
船着火时，你往船外走
对，我们往船外走
走吧，老家伙
When the ship's on fiire,
you go overboard.
Right. Overboard we go!
Let's go, old man.

780
01:34:05,595 --> 01:34:08,684
那里有人
- Someone's there.
- The window! Run for it.

781
01:34:08,754 --> 01:34:09,684
那窗！跟到那里去
I'll draw them off.

782
01:34:09,755 --> 01:34:11,753
我去搞定他们
Don't move! Keep quiet.

783
01:34:11,755 --> 01:34:19,688
不要动！保持安静
留在原地
Stay where you are!

784
01:34:36,607 --> 01:34:37,799
French...

785
01:34:38,766 --> 01:34:41,697
说法语的
We're not thieves.

786
01:34:41,767 --> 01:34:45,699
我们不是贼

787
01:34:47,110 --> 01:34:48,336
Prisoners of war?

788
01:34:48,771 --> 01:34:55,703
战争犯？
说德语吗？
You speak German?

789
01:34:55,773 --> 01:34:58,703
我扭了脚，我们累坏了
I sprained my foot. We're exhausted.
We're not thieves.

790
01:34:58,774 --> 01:35:01,704
我们不是贼
我不怕
I'm not afraid.

791
01:35:01,775 --> 01:35:03,706
去叫警察吧
Go on, call the police.
I won't walk another step!

792
01:35:03,775 --> 01:35:10,709
我不会再动一步了
你扭了脚
You sprained your foot?

793
01:35:15,782 --> 01:35:22,713
她说进到房子里边去
不，我不相信她
She says to come into the house.
No, I don't trust her.

794
01:35:25,660 --> 01:35:30,717
她说她孤单一人在这儿
She says she's alone here.

795
01:36:13,877 --> 01:36:18,078
她说她孩子在睡觉，
别弄出声音
She says her child's asleep,
so don't make any noise.

796
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:22,737
来，坐这里吧
Come and sit down here.

797
01:36:25,183 --> 01:36:29,740
我很快会回来
I'll be right back.

798
01:36:59,562 --> 01:37:01,695
饿了吗？
Hungry? Yes.

799
01:37:01,697 --> 01:37:06,755
她问你饿了没有
我听懂了
- She asked if you're hungry.
- Yeah, I understood.

800
01:37:20,672 --> 01:37:22,570
你呢？
What about you?

801
01:37:22,572 --> 01:37:27,763
我只想睡一下
I just want to sleep.

802
01:38:08,848 --> 01:38:12,783
劳驾，往沃菲斯翰怎么走？
Excuse me, but how far is W鰈fiisheim?
Eight miles.

803
01:38:12,849 --> 01:38:15,849
八英里远
I'd sooner stay here
than slog up there!

804
01:38:15,851 --> 01:38:24,785
去那里，我倒愿留在这里
但是，责任是责任
谢谢了，晚安
But duty's duty.
Thanks and good night.

805
01:38:52,541 --> 01:38:57,798
嘘！孩子在睡觉呢！
Hush! My child's asleep!

806
01:38:58,609 --> 01:38:59,801
My husband.

807
01:38:59,867 --> 01:39:01,867
这是我丈夫
Killed at Verdun.

808
01:39:01,869 --> 01:39:06,869
死在菲尔敦
My brothers...

809
01:39:06,871 --> 01:39:12,804
我的兄弟
Killed at Li鑗e...
死在利格，撒路洛…
唐纳伯格
Charleroi... Tannenberg.

810
01:39:14,150 --> 01:39:18,807
我们最大的胜利
Our biggest victories.

811
01:39:20,920 --> 01:39:25,809
现在这张桌子太大了
The table's too big now.

812
01:39:31,788 --> 01:39:36,813
别紧张，是我罢了
Relax, it's only me!

813
01:39:36,958 --> 01:39:41,815
你不介意一法国人喂你吧
You don't mind
ifa Frenchman feeds you.

814
01:39:43,160 --> 01:39:46,884
你闻起来像我祖父的奶牛
You smell like my grandfather's cows.
A good smell.

815
01:39:46,886 --> 01:40:00,823
好味道
You're a cow from W黵temberg
你是沃滕伯格的奶牛
而我是巴黎来的工人
但我们可以是伙计
你是头可怜的牛
我是可怜的士兵
and I'm a working man from Paris,
but we can still be pals!
You're a poor cow,
I'm a poor soldier.

816
01:40:00,892 --> 01:40:04,824
我们各自尽力
We each do our best.

817
01:40:59,157 --> 01:41:01,923
你是个聪明的小女孩
You're a bright little girl.

818
01:41:01,925 --> 01:41:04,256
妈妈和我是无所不知
Mommy and I know everything.

819
01:41:04,258 --> 01:41:05,925
真的？
Really?

820
01:41:05,927 --> 01:41:10,091
那奶牛每月产多少奶？
Then how much milk
does the cow give each month?

821
01:41:10,093 --> 01:41:15,852
这个妈妈知道
我知道我有10个指头
Mommy knows that.
I know I have ten fiingers.

822
01:41:34,771 --> 01:41:37,925
她要些水
She asked for water.
I know.

823
01:41:37,930 --> 01:41:45,864
我知道
18个月了，
我从未听懂哨兵的话
但她的我听不懂了
For 18 months, I never understood
the guards. But her I understand.

824
01:41:59,281 --> 01:42:02,870
可以，但它看来廉价
我已尽力了
- Nice, but it looks cheap.
- I did my best.

825
01:42:02,940 --> 01:42:06,873
我在跟圣诞老人说话呢
I was talking to Santa Claus.

826
01:42:09,943 --> 01:42:12,385
约瑟夫的胡子真漂亮
Joseph's got a nice beard!

827
01:42:12,387 --> 01:42:14,875
这是圣女玛丽
Here's the Virgin Mary.

828
01:42:14,945 --> 01:42:17,876
我的小驴漂亮吧？
Isn't my little donkey cute?

829
01:42:17,946 --> 01:42:19,877
我的公牛呢？
And my ox?

830
01:42:19,947 --> 01:42:23,887
还有圣婴耶酥
And the infant Jesus...
An ancestor of mine.

831
01:42:23,948 --> 01:42:24,879
我的一个祖先
"Touch?"
as poor Boeldieu would say.

832
01:42:24,948 --> 01:42:26,879
就像可怜的玻狄奥要说的一样

833
01:42:26,950 --> 01:42:28,882
你认为他死了吗？
- Think he's dead?
- Let's not talk about it.

834
01:42:28,950 --> 01:42:30,882
我们不要谈这个

835
01:42:30,950 --> 01:42:34,883
我们准备好了，
叫孩子来吧
We're ready. Go get the kid.

836
01:42:37,954 --> 01:42:41,886
等等…
还有留声机和蜡烛
Hold on...
The gramophone and the candles.

837
01:42:43,956 --> 01:42:47,888
熄灯！
Lights out!

838
01:42:52,368 --> 01:42:55,891
洛特，圣婴耶酥来了
Lotte! Baby Jesus has come.

839
01:42:55,961 --> 01:42:59,893
我知道他会来的
I knew he would!

840
01:43:09,966 --> 01:43:13,140
给我的吗？
Is it for me?

841
01:43:13,142 --> 01:43:15,900
我要小耶
I want little Jesus.

842
01:43:15,969 --> 01:43:17,901
带到床上去？
To take to bed?

843
01:43:17,969 --> 01:43:20,901
不，是吃掉他
No, to eat.

844
01:43:20,971 --> 01:43:23,379
他不是拿来吃的
He's not for eating.

845
01:43:23,381 --> 01:43:27,904
她想吃圣婴耶  ！
She wants to eat Baby Jesus!

846
01:43:28,974 --> 01:43:32,906
绝对不可，甜宝宝！
Strictly forbidden, my sweet!

847
01:43:32,975 --> 01:43:35,415
那我就去吃约瑟夫
Then I'll eat Joseph.

848
01:43:35,417 --> 01:43:39,910
好的，但得在床吃
All right, but in bed.

849
01:43:39,978 --> 01:43:43,911
她要约瑟夫？给你
She wants Joseph? There you go.

850
01:43:46,923 --> 01:43:51,913
你是个好女孩
You're a good little girl.

851
01:43:54,325 --> 01:43:58,916
你的留声机变声了
Your gramophone's on the blink.

852
01:43:59,427 --> 01:44:03,919
"洛特有蓝色的眼睛"怎么说？
How do you say:
" Lotte has blue eyes"?

853
01:44:23,437 --> 01:44:27,929
睡觉去，南瓜
Go to sleep, pumpkin.

854
01:44:48,005 --> 01:44:50,046
我不知怎样感谢你
I don't know how to thank you.

855
01:44:50,048 --> 01:44:51,938
感谢我们？
Thank us?

856
01:44:52,006 --> 01:44:55,939
我们欠你这么多
We owe you so much.

857
01:44:56,008 --> 01:44:59,940
好吧，晚安
Well... good night.

858
01:46:45,993 --> 01:46:47,984
我去煮些咖啡
I'll make some coffee.

859
01:46:48,052 --> 01:46:49,984
咖啡已煮好了
The coffee's ready.

860
01:46:50,054 --> 01:46:53,986
用法语说
Say it in French.

861
01:47:02,500 --> 01:47:06,989
你告诉她我们要走了吗？
Have you told her we're leaving?

862
01:47:07,060 --> 01:47:08,268
还没有
Not yet.

863
01:47:08,270 --> 01:47:12,368
是时候了
It's high time.

864
01:47:12,370 --> 01:47:16,994
你告诉她吧
You tell her.

865
01:47:21,507 --> 01:47:24,998
我们一定得走
我知道
- We must be going.
- I knew it.

866
01:47:25,067 --> 01:47:28,999
马利沙不忍告诉你
Mar閏hal couldn't bear to tell you.

867
01:47:30,078 --> 01:47:32,000
为什么？
Why?

868
01:47:32,069 --> 01:47:36,002
我早知道他会走的
I always knew he'd have to go.

869
01:47:43,283 --> 01:47:46,005
进来吧
Come on in.

870
01:47:46,075 --> 01:47:50,007
有热咖啡
There's hot coffee.

871
01:48:08,259 --> 01:48:13,016
吃点东西再走吧
You should eat something
before you go.

872
01:48:19,262 --> 01:48:21,262
要等到天黑吗？
Do we wait until dark?

873
01:48:21,264 --> 01:48:26,022
要
Sure.

874
01:48:35,094 --> 01:48:39,026
我们去跟牛说再见
Let's say good-bye to the cow.

875
01:48:41,039 --> 01:48:45,029
我孤单得太久了
I've been alone too long.

876
01:48:45,098 --> 01:48:49,031
我等得太久了
I've waited so long.

877
01:48:49,575 --> 01:48:54,032
听到你在房子周围的脚步声
If you knew how happy I've been

878
01:48:54,144 --> 01:48:59,034
你可知我曾经多快乐
to hear your footsteps
around the house.

879
01:49:06,106 --> 01:49:10,039
埃沙…听着
Elsa... Listen.

880
01:49:11,317 --> 01:49:14,450
等战争结束
When war over...

881
01:49:14,452 --> 01:49:16,983
如我还未死
if me not dead...

882
01:49:16,985 --> 01:49:20,041
明白吗？
Understand?

883
01:49:20,112 --> 01:49:24,044
我回到这里来…不
I... come back here... no?

884
01:49:26,114 --> 01:49:28,589
而你…之后…来…
And you... after... come...

885
01:49:28,591 --> 01:49:32,048
跟我…去法国
with me... to France.

886
01:49:32,116 --> 01:49:36,049
和洛特一起去…不好吗？
With Lotte... no?

887
01:49:37,394 --> 01:49:42,051
给你旅途的
For the journey.

888
01:49:48,232 --> 01:49:53,056
快点走，最好这样走
Go quickly. It's better that way.

889
01:50:31,648 --> 01:50:38,071
不望回头？
如望回头，
我可能就不走了
- Not looking back?
- If I do, I might never leave.

890
01:51:10,863 --> 01:51:14,087
走吧
不等天黑了
- Let's move.
- We're not waiting till dark?

891
01:51:14,157 --> 01:51:16,087
我们会迷路的
We'd lose ourway.

892
01:51:16,157 --> 01:51:18,087
树林会掩护我们
The woods will hide us. But in
the valley, we'll have to stay low.

893
01:51:18,158 --> 01:51:23,089
但在峡谷里，
我们得往低处走
你肯定那是瑞士？
You're sure that's Switzerland?

894
01:51:23,159 --> 01:51:25,089
肯定
- Positive.
- It all looks the same.

895
01:51:25,161 --> 01:51:26,091
看起来都一样
You can't see borders.
They're man-made.

896
01:51:26,161 --> 01:51:30,093
看不到边界的，
他们是人造的

897
01:51:30,162 --> 01:51:32,093
大自然也就这样了
Nature couldn't care less.

898
01:51:32,164 --> 01:51:35,094
我想这一切有个了断
I want to see an end to all this.

899
01:51:35,166 --> 01:51:37,096
然后我就回到埃沙身边
Then I'd go back for Elsa.

900
01:51:37,166 --> 01:51:39,096
你爱她？  我想是的
- You love her?
- I think so.

901
01:51:39,166 --> 01:51:41,096
即使我们成功了也要这样
Even if we do make it,

902
01:51:41,167 --> 01:51:43,097
你会回去再开飞机，
我就扛枪
you'll go back to flying
and me to gunning, we'll keep fighting.

903
01:51:43,168 --> 01:51:46,098
我们继续战斗

904
01:51:46,169 --> 01:51:47,099
像那些伙计们
Like the fellas.
We've got to end this damn war...

905
01:51:47,169 --> 01:51:49,099
我们得结束这该死的战争…

906
01:51:49,170 --> 01:51:51,101
让它成为最后一次大战
and make it the last.

907
01:51:51,170 --> 01:51:53,101
不要欺骗自己了
Don't delude yourself.

908
01:51:53,172 --> 01:51:55,103
我们下到地吧？
Let's come down to earth.
What if we run into a patrol?

909
01:51:55,174 --> 01:51:57,172
碰到巡逻队怎办？
We split up, and try our luck.

910
01:51:57,174 --> 01:52:10,108
我们就分开，
大家好运吧
只是以防万一而已
再见吧，希望很快再见到你
再见，你这脏犹太人
再见，你这老东西
just in case, let's say goodbye
and see you soon.
- So long, you dirty Jew.
- So long, you old dog.

911
01:52:47,635 --> 01:52:50,124
别开枪！他们在瑞士境内了
Don't shoot!
They're in Switzerland.

912
01:52:50,195 --> 01:52:54,126
祝他们好运吧！
Good for them!

913
01:53:23,195 --> 01:53:33,126
