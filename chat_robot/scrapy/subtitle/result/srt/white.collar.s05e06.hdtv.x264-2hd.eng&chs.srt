1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,760
"妙警贼探" 前情提要...
Previously on White Collar...

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:03,330
Mosconi法典
The Mosconi Codex.

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,060
这可不是一般的书
This is no ordinary book.

4
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:06,860
- Neal  - 你好 Rebecca
- Neal.  - Hello, Rebecca.

5
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:08,230
你们俩认识?
You two know each other?

6
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,400
我发誓 我下班的时候还戴着员工卡
I swear, I had my key card when I left work.

7
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,000
我们一旦找出那本书里有什么秘密
We figure out what's hidden in those pages

8
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,630
就能先下手为强
and get to it first.

9
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,400
因为我 那个贼才进来的
I'm the reason the thief got in.

10
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,230
我本来是希望收藏家能让我们看一看
My hope was that the owner would let us study

11
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,300
研究研究那本手抄本的 可现在也不在了
and look at the codex, and now it's gone.

12
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,300
David Siegel 死因是
David Siegel. Cause of death

13
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,560
胸部中枪
was a gunshot wound to the sternum.

14
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,300
凶手是谁 动机何在 我们还是毫无头绪
And we're no closer to figuring out who did this and why.

15
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,900
Summers医生 我需要你的帮助
Dr. Summers, I need your help.

16
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,030
一个人开始做好事
Just because a person starts doing good things

17
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,530
并不意味着就不做坏事了
doesn't mean he wants to stop doing bad things.

18
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,130
我有太多主子了
I've been serving too many masters.

19
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,560
我受够了当每个人的玩偶
I'm through being everyone's puppet.

20
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,960
你到底计划脱离哪一方呢?
Which strings, exactly, do you plan on cutting?

21
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,230
统统再见
All of them.

22
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,300
很不错

23
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,530
连封面上的芯片也跟真的一样
Even the chip in the cover works.

24
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,700
你是怎么做到的?
How'd you pull that off?

25
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,930
我不负责做 只负责卖
I don't make them. I just sell them.

26
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:32,560
你个狗娘养的
You son of a bitch.

27
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:34,260
不许动! 举起手来
Freeze! Hands in the air.

28
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:36,060
联邦调查局! 不准动!
FBI! Don't move!

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,500
他是你的了
He's all yours.

30
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,030
- 干嘛?  - 别装模作样的
- What?  - Don't "what" me.

31
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,600
你知道是干嘛 我告诉你明确步骤了
You know what. I gave you specific instructions.

32
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,560
"坐下 交易 逮捕"
"sit down, make the deal, get arrested."

33
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,200
这三步你哪一步不满意了?
Three out of three not good enough for you?

34
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,700
我可不记得我提过
I don't remember mentioning anything

35
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,060
逮捕前还有什么后续提问
about follow-up questions or interrogating the suspect

36
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,530
- 或是盘问嫌犯  - 盘问嫌...
- before the arrest.  - Interrogating the sus...

37
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,860
你在说什... 哦 芯片?
What are you... What, the chip?

38
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,300
- 就是芯片  - 我在收集信息
- The chip.  - I was gathering information.

39
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,430
- 为局里还是为你自己啊?  - 我要是在打什么主意
- For you or for us?  - If I were up to something,

40
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,260
你真以为我会当着你的面问?
you really think I'd do it when you had ears on me?

41
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,700
你就是会这么干
That's exactly when you'd do it.

42
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,000
我感觉这案子不仅仅是关于伪造护照
I have a feeling this is about more than passports.

43
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,300
就是关于护照 以及上一件案子里
Oh, it's about passports. Also about the $2 million

44
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,530
失踪的200万美金
that went missing in the last case.

45
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,930
Summers医生说不定能靠直觉
Oh, Dr. Summers might have some insight

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,230
- 找出它们来  - Summers医生乐于将
- into its location.  - Dr. Summers had a tendency

47
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,900
一心想改头换面的坏人
to take bad guys who wanna be good

48
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,330
变得更坏
and turn them into worse guys.

49
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,600
你的治疗过程中到底发生了什么?
What exactly happened during your therapy session?

50
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:29,300
她鼓励我做真正的自己
She encouraged me to be the man I really am.

51
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,360
Lucy会对Charlie Brown说这种话
I think Lucy told Charlie Brown that

52
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,830
然后只收5美分?(他们都是史努比里的角色 关系不好)
and only charged him 5 cents?

53
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,300
那准确说来 你真正的自我是什么样呢?
And what kind of man might that be, exactly?

54
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,830
这个问题我们下一疗程再讨论
We were gonna discuss that at our next session.

55
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,300
现在我得再等20年
Now I have to wait 20 years.

56
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,130
我想这大概是Jones的
I think these belong to Jones.

57
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,260
嘿 这些都是哪儿来的?
Hey, where'd you get all these?

58
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:55,760
全市各地抄查没收来的
Confiscated in various busts around the city.

59
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,430
大多都是过去几星期
Most in the last few weeks.

60
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,960
它们质量一流 且工艺完全相同
It's first-rate and identical.

61
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,530
这些都是同一个人做的
These were all made by the same person.

62
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,900
- 你确定?  - 没错 你看封面上的鹰眼
- You're sure about that?  - Yeah, the eagle's eye.

63
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,530
这一本和我从Ivan手上买到的那本一样
There's a tiny dot in the center of this one

64
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,460
中间都有个小点
and in the one I bought from Ivan.

65
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:09,200
这个点几乎和指纹一样完美
That dot is as good as a fingerprint.

66
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,330
所以我们面对的是一个相当大的伪造集团
So we're looking at a fairly large forgery operation.

67
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,730
你觉得Ivan是伪造师吗?
You think Ivan's the artist?

68
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,760
不是 他说他只负责卖 我相信他
No, he says he only sells them, and I believe him.

69
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,360
任何一个如此优秀的人都会想居功
Anyone this good would take credit.

70
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,660
你觉得这个与
Think this has something to do

71
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,000
小奥德萨区犯罪率的上升有关吗?
with the uptick of crime in Little Odessa?

72
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,000
我不相信巧合
I don't believe in coincidences.

73
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,730
Ivan的违规停车罚单
Ivan's parking tickets.

74
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,260
今年已经十张了 而且都在
Ten so far this year, and they're all

75
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:27,730
同一个位置
in the exact same spot.

76
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,730
我需要这条街上
I want traffic surveillance video

77
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,630
过去六个月的监控录像
for the past six months on that address.

78
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,560
这就去办
Already on it.

79
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,230
- 当真?  - 当真
- Really?  - Really.

80
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,900
同一个地点 每天都这样
Same spot, day after day.

81
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,530
就在消防栓跟前
Right in front of the hydrant.

82
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,700
这条街上有很多咪表停车位
There's plenty of metered parking down the street.

83
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,000
为什么甘冒被贴罚单的危险?
Why risk another ticket?

84
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,660
多莉丝·戴停车位
Doris Day parking.

85
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,730
抱歉 多莉丝·戴的啥?
I'm sorry. Doris Day what?

86
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,460
正前方的停车位
Spot right in front.

87
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,930
就是多莉丝·戴在她的每部电影里
The kind of parking doris Day miraculously finds

88
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,530
- 都能神奇地找到的停车位  - 没想到你居然是她粉丝
- in all her movies.  - I never knew you were a fan.

89
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,300
我喜欢那些电影
Oh, I love 'em.

90
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,300
这地方看起来废弃了
Place looks abandoned.

91
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,430
是啊 对于护照伪造集团来说不算糟
Yeah, not a bad spot for a passport forgery operation.

92
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,960
我们去弄张搜查令来检查检查
Let's get a warrant and check it out.

93
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,730
密码使用的历史... 令人惊异地隐秘
The history of cryptography... Oddly cryptic.

94
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,430
进展如何 找出这是哪种密码了吗?
Any luck finding out what type of code this is?

95
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,930
我已经排除了移位式密码和凯撒方阵
Oh, I've ruled out transposition and Caesar shifts.

96
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,160
哦 还有数独以及聪明方格
Oh, and sudoku and kenken.

97
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,030
说不定你无意中还证明了
Well, in a happy accident, you may have proven

98
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,660
黎曼假设呢
the Riemann hypothesis.

99
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:32,200
我唯一能证明的是我们需要帮助
The only thing I've proven is that we need help.

100
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,900
我研究了每一个图案 每一个符号
I've studied every pattern, every symbol.

101
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,330
只能总结得出 这东西来自外星人
I can only conclude that it is of alien origin.

102
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,600
我觉得你是对的
I think you're right.

103
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,560
啊哈! 你总算醒悟了
Aha! Finally, you've come around.

104
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,130
我觉得你是对的 我们需要帮助
I think you're right. We need help.

105
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,730
哦
Oh.

106
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,700
我倒是认识一个柏林的修道士
Well, I do know a monk in Berlin

107
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,700
对量子力学有所涉猎
who dabbles in quantum mechanics.

108
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,960
你觉得Hagen在利用修道士?
You think Hagen's using monks?

109
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,300
我觉得Hagen在利用你
I think Hagen is using you.

110
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,660
还有我
and me.

111
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:58,060
率先破解出法典是我们
The only chance we have of getting a leg up on him

112
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,630
扳倒他的唯一机会
is by deciphering the Codex first.

113
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,860
那时...
Until then...

114
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,430
还有很多事情要做
It's ticking clocks and phone calls.

115
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,660
好吧 我得走了
All right, I gotta go.

116
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,800
Peter和我要去找小奥德萨
Peter and I are headed to Little Odessa.

117
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,300
我来跟她说
I do the talking.

118
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,800
我们是来常规检查的
We're just here on a routine visit.

119
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,700
仅此而已
Nothing more.

120
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,400
哦...
Well...

121
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,130
看来不像被废弃了
Doesn't look abandoned.

122
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,530
看来有人重新启用了这里
Looks like someone brought it back to life.

123
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,630
哇 每次我看到冰场
Wow. Every time I see ice like this,

124
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,830
就仿佛回到了童年
I'm ten again.

125
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,330
- 哦 滑得真不错  - 嗯
- Oh, she's good.  - Yeah.

126
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,330
先是多丽丝·戴(德国女导演) 接着又是花样滑冰
First Doris Day, now figure skating.

127
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,060
能看到你柔情面 真是有幸
It's nice to see your softer side.

128
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,130
你们是谁? 找我什么事?
Who are you? What do you want?

129
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,600
我们只想问几个问题
We just have a few questions

130
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,930
关于这座楼的主人
for the owner of this building.

131
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
赶紧收起来 要不然我们都有危险
Put that away, or you'll get all of us killed.

132
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,500
嘿!
Hey!

133
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,000
这里是私人领地
This is private facility.

134
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,160
你们不能擅自闯进来
You're trespassing.

135
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,230
我想他们只是走错了

136
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,330
闭嘴 Katya!

137
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,030
我们只想问点事情
We just have a few questions.

我是体育经纪人 Neal Micali

141
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,330
我旗下有很多世界级运动员

142
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,200
这位是Peter Nevins

147
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:06,530
Peter Nevins教练?
Peter Nevins, coach?

148
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,760
没听说过
Never heard of you.

149
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:10,000
是吗? 那你听过塔拉·利平斯基吗?(花滑奥运冠军)
Really? You ever heard of Tara Lipinski?

150
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,230
还有关颖珊?(著名华裔花滑运动员)
Or Michelle Kwan?

151
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,660
如果没有他
They would be ushers at the ice capades

152
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:13,830
她们只能当场馆引座员
if it weren't for this man.

153
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,530
哦 没错 但...
Oh, yes. He's just...

154
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,830
但... 我只是让她们的天赋
He's just... I simply help them harness

155
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,260
发挥出来
their own natural talents.

156
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,560
不好意思 让你们白来了一趟
Sorry to be wasting your time,

157
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,460
Katya不想参加什么比赛
but Katya has no interest in competing.

158
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:37,860
求你了 Sergei 我想换教练 我想参加比赛

159
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,660
谢谢你们的好意
Thank you for your interest.

160
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,530
- 但抱歉 请吧...  - 没关系
- Now, if you'll excuse us...  - It's not a problem.

161
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,130
这周还要访问另外20个备选人...
We got another 20 girls to see by the end of the week, so...

162
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,760
- 是27个  - 现在是27个了?
- 27.  - Is it 27 now?

163
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,800
- 是27个  - 听我说...
- It's 27.  - Listen...

164
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,530
你有天赋
you're talented.

165
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,000
非常有天赋
Very talented.

166
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,400
别放弃你的梦想
Don't give up on your dream.

167
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:58,100
不好意思 耽误彼此的时间了
Sorry we wasted your time and ours.

168
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:04,000
等等 现在不太方便
Wait. This is not the right time.

169
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,960
但是你们先别选别人
But don't choose another girl yet.

170
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,460
给你
Here.

171
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,400
那我们再联系
We'll be in touch.

172
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,960
- 花样滑冰教练?  - 怎么了?
- Figure skating coach?  - What?

173
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,860
你从当上联邦调查员就开始滑冰了
You've been skating since you were a junior G-man.

174
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,230
但我是打冰球的
But that was hockey.

175
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,800
我们练习的是身体阻挡 不是转圈
We're talking body checks, not twirls.

176
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,060
别这样 这样伪装很好
Oh, come on. It's a good cover.

177
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,560
我才不用伪装 我可以带着特种部队冲进去
I don't need a cover. I could go in there

178
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,630
把里面里里外外搜个遍
with a tac team and turn that place upside down.

179
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,060
如果你想打草惊蛇
Yeah, you could if you wanted to scare off the guys

180
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:28,200
确实可以这么做
we're really after.

181
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,130
你就承认吧... 这个案子的最佳切入点
Just admit it... best way into this case

182
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,660
是滑冰
is on skates.

183
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,400
你已经入围了
You got a ticket.

184
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,400
你要照张简历照 不是搞怪照片
Come on, this is for your bio, not a mug shot.

185
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,860
- 快点  - 哦 折磨死我了
- Come on.  - Oh, you're killing me.

186
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:42,630
我没这闲工夫 我还有工作要做
I don't have time for this. I've got asac work.

187
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,600
- 我没工夫玩这些  - 笑一个
- I can't play dress-up.  - Just smile.

188
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:55,560
Rebecca吗?
Rebecca?

189
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,300
Gershon博物馆的
From the Gershon Museum.

190
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,900
联邦调查局的Neal
Neal, from the FBI.

191
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,930
- 嘿  - 嗨
- Hey.  - Hi.

192
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,600
- 你好吗?  - 我...
- How are you?  - I'm, uh...

193
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,860
一团糟
terrible.

194
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:06,660
博物馆界的都互相认识
The museum world, it's really small.

195
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,130
很难找到别的工作
I can't get another job.

196
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,900
我很抱歉
I'm sorry to hear that.

197
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,460
我能帮你什么吗?
Is there anything I can do to help?

198
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:13,600
你? 不用
You?  No.

199
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,860
你做得够多了
You've done enough.

200
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,100
哇...
Whoa. Wha...

201
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,700
我回想了一下
I've been thinking about that day

202
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,230
找不到门卡的那天
that I lost my key card,

203
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,660
我记得最后看到它 就是和你在一起的时候
and you're the last person that I remember having it with.

204
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,200
你不会是觉得我偷了它吧?
What, you don't think I stole it, do you?

205
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,560
我为什么要偷你的门卡? 我可以自由出入博物馆的
Why would I steal your key card? I had full access to the museum.

206
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,830
那天你无缘无故约了我
Nothing about that day makes sense.

207
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,830
我来是为了问点事情...
I'm just here to get some answers and...

208
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,060
我希望Burke探员能给我开个证明信
I was hoping to get a letter from Agent Burke

209
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:31,700
证明我是清白的
stating my complete innocence.

210
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,430
- 他在那里  - 嗯...
- There he is.  - Uh, yeah, that's...

211
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,900
别这样做
that's a really bad idea.

212
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,230
他正在纠结另一个案子
He is swamped on a new case right now

213
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,800
最好别惹他
and just not in a giving mood.

214
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,700
况且他也不再负责Gershon博物馆案子的调查了
Anyway, he wasn't even in charge of the Gershon investigation.

215
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,730
- 那谁负责?  - Gruetzner探员
- Then who was?  - That would be Agent Gruetzner.

216
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,100
他是艺术品犯罪小组的 不在这里办公
Art crimes. He's not at these offices.

217
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,760
那我要去哪里找...
So where do I find this Agent...

218
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,560
- Gruetzner探员?  - Gruetzner探员
- Gruetzner?  - Gruetzner.

219
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,300
他今天出去办案了
Uh, he is in the field today.

220
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,030
但我可以帮你跟他预约一下明天见面
But I could set something up for tomorrow.

221
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,400
- 好吧  - 好了?
- All right.  - All right?

222
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,730
- 那就明天  - 好的
- Tomorrow.  - Okay.

223
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,630
我把电话号码留给你
Let me give you my number.

224
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,900
然后你把地址发短信给我
You can text me the address.

225
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,600
我们是联邦调查局 当然有你电话
We're the FBI. We have your number.

226
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,700
- 哦  - 你会拿到证明信的
- Ha.  - I'll get you that letter.

227
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,530
什么情况?
What's the story?

228
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,100
这位Sergei Turgenev
Sergei Turgenev.

229
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,060
就是冰场那个能说会道的家伙
Our smooth-talking friend from the ice rink.

230
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:13,230
从信息局一个朋友那得到的材料
Got that from a friend at FAPSI.

231
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,760
- 那可是俄罗斯情报局  - 俄罗斯情报局
- That's Russian Intelligence.  - Russian Intelligence.

232
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:17,030
嗯 这里边全是警方的犯罪记录
Yeah, this is the crime and punishment of rap sheets.

233
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,460
这个家伙... 更了不得了
And this guy... is worse.

234
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:20,660
Sergei的堂弟Nikolai
That's Sergei' s cousin Nikolai.

235
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,030
因谋杀罪被俄国政府通缉
Wanted for murder in Russia.

236
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,630
洗钱 贩毒
Money laundering, drug trafficking,

237
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,830
走私武器 贩运人口
arms trafficking, human trafficking.

238
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,000
基本上 只要是偷渡走私的事都干
Basically, any kind of trafficking.

239
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,330
嗯 到现在为止
- Yeah.  - Nobody knew he was

240
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,130
没人知道他在这儿
in the country until now.

241
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,400
我们不可能给罪犯签证
We don't give visas to criminals,

242
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,800
他要么是偷渡过来...
so either he snuck in on a tuna boat...

243
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,300
要么就是用Sergei的护照
Or he flew here first-class

244
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,860
坐着头等舱过来的
using one of Sergei' s passports.

245
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:38,060
问题是.. .如果Sergei能神不知鬼不觉把Nikolai带进来
Question is... if Sergei can bring Nikolai in here

246
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:41,460
他还打算把谁弄进来呢?
without us knowing, who else is he planning to import?

247
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:42,930
如果我事先知道这个
If I had known about this,

248
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,760
你就能和Sergei一起玩冰球了
you could be playing hockey with Sergei

249
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:45,730
而不是坐着这里
instead of learning the difference

250
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,000
研究勾手跳和后内跳的区别了
between a lutz and a salchow.

251
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,360
行了 你不用为我操心
All right, don't you worry about me.

252
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:51,100
你把自己装成一个顶尖的体育经纪人就成了
You just focus on becoming a top sports agent.

253
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,530
骗子还能拿到10%的回扣? 我肯定没问题
Con men taking 10%? I think I can handle it.

254
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,760
好吧 你的意思是
Okay, let me get this straight.

255
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:02,630
你要在一天之内成为一个花样滑的专家级教练?
You need to become an expert figure skating coach in a day?

256
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,760
错 我只需要看起来像就行了
No, I just need to look the part

257
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,460
然后在学一些必要技能
And learn enough to pass muster.

258
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:07,330
那么.... 你打算怎么帮我?
So... what can you tell me?

259
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,830
- 我?  - 对
- Me?  - Yeah.

260
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,930
你要让我在一天内把你训练成一个教练?
You want me to coach you to become a coach?

261
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,760
没错 亲爱的 你看了那么多花样游泳的比赛
Yeah. Honey, you have watched enough figure skating

262
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:16,560
都能担任下一任世界比赛的解说员了
to do color commentary on the next world championship.

263
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:19,030
是啊 我们通常称之为纸上谈兵
Yeah, that's what we call an armchair expert.

264
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,660
亲爱的 说跟做是不一样的
Honey, that is a world away from actually doing it.

265
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,760
你还记得吗... 我第一次滑冰
You remember... First time I was on the ice,

266
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,300
- 是我们第二次约会  - 记得
- it was our second date.  - Hmm.

267
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,060
我怎么能忘了呢?
How could I forget?

268
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:28,730
你本来该好好教我的
You were supposed to teach me.

269
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,030
呃 我怎么能做到?
Well, how could I?

270
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,200
你像小鹿斑比一样四仰八叉躺在冰上...
You were sprawled out on the ice like bambi...

271
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,260
看起来可爱极了
and looking just as adorable.

272
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:37,030
反应够快啊
Good save.

273
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,360
好吧 我们这样来
All right, this is what we're gonna do.

274
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,600
先从基本的开始
We're gonna start with the basics.

275
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,830
进度快的话 午夜能到
Then we're gonna move to Tonya Harding

276
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,830
Tonya Harding和Nancy Kerrigan(世界级花样滑选手)
and Nancy Kerrigan, hopefully by midnight.

277
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,160
好呀 以后有空
Uh-huh, and then one day,

278
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,700
我一定教你滑冰
I will finally teach you how to skate.

279
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,960
哦 不 这个案子一结
Oh, no, you're gonna teach me how to skate

280
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:49,760
你就得教我
as soon as this case is over.

281
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,730
我看起来怎么样?
How do I look?

282
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,200
像个联邦调查局的会计
Like an FBI accountant.

283
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,560
Gruetzner探员故意穿得很保守
Agent Gruetzner's conservative attire

284
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,500
以图掩饰他的破坏力
is just an attempt to disguise

285
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,860
和波西米亚人的身份
his subversive and Bohemian proclivities.

286
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,500
别夸大其辞了 Moz
Ah, don't overplay this, Moz.

287
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,830
又不是晚餐剧院
It is not dinner theatre.

288
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,260
不过就是回答几个问题罢了
You just need to answer a few simple questions.

289
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,030
我可是大师级的即兴表演家
I'm a master improviser.

290
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,430
我要出演一个完美且苛求的主管
I will be the perfect exigent supervisor.

291
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,530
你说了很多遍了
That sounds familiar.

292
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,330
当然 这可不是第一次
Yeah, it's not the first time

293
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,000
我穿上这身行头
the suit's gotten under my skin.

294
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,160
我刚刚从苛求的主管那得到消息
I just heard from the exigent supervisor.

295
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:21,730
好像Sergei想要改成明天在一个伏特加酒吧见面
Looks like Sergei wants to meet at a vodka bar tomorrow,

296
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,130
这下坏事了
And that's a problem.

297
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,360
我同一时间必须待在小奥德萨
I need to be in Little Odessa at the same time

298
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:25,900
还答应了陪Rebecca去见你
I promised Rebecca a meeting with you.

299
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,460
你错了 在我看来 这正是我们的机会
You say problem, I say opportunity.

300
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:30,100
你就不用被束缚了
You'll be off leash.

301
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,900
你可以偷偷溜走 猫咪探长却不知道
You can slip away, and big brother will be none the wiser.

302
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,460
确实 我们有办公室吗?
True. Do we have an office yet?

303
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:36,660
有 而且不远
Yeah, and it's not far.

304
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:39,100
Gravich医生 我的前任脊椎指压治疗师
Dr. Gravich, my former chiropractor

305
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,860
也是所有脊椎病患者的救星
and hero to ambulance chasers everywhere

306
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:43,900
每天下午一点到两点
takes his entire staff out to lunch

307
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,460
都会带上所有员工去吃午餐
from 1:00 until 2:00 every day.

308
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:48,230
一个脊椎指压治疗师的办公室?
A chiropractor's office?

309
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,800
再来些海报和各种人像
With some posters and sundry accoutrements,

310
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,900
也挺不错的
it'll look the part.

311
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,760
为了不让她问太多问题
And to keep her from asking too many questions,

312
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,030
我们可以给她看看法典
we can show her the codex.

313
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,900
她可是Mosconi专家啊
She is a mosconi expert.

314
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,360
所以在你害她丢了工作前
That's why she started working at the museum.

315
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:00,960
- 她在博物馆工作  - 也许如果让她
- until you got her fired.  - Maybe she'll forgive us

316
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,430
看上一眼我们的法典章节 就会原谅我们
if we give her a little peek at our chapter.

317
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,230
这样你就能弥补自己的过失
So you can reward her for your misdeed

318
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,430
而她也能提供我们想要的情报了
by having her reward us with her information.

319
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,930
- 嗨?  - 哦!
- Hello?  - Oh!

320
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,930
我们的演员来了
Here comes one of our accoutrements now.

321
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,460
快来跟我们艺术品犯罪小组的迷人接待员打个招呼
Say hello to the art crimes division's comely receptionist.

322
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:18,160
这里是联邦调查局 请问需要什么帮助?
FBI. May I help you?

323
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,030
好吧
All right.

324
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,660
好吧 Jones和特别行动小组
All right, Jones and the Tac team

325
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:32,560
在几个街区以外的一辆货车上
are in a van a few blocks away.

326
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,800
再近可能会威胁到我们的安全
Any closer and I think it'd be too risky.

327
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,500
没错 但你喝了半瓶伏特加之后更危险
Yeah, no riskier than you after half a bottle of vodka.

328
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,360
- 什么?  - 所以我才做了这个
- What?  - Which is why I made these.

329
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:40,460
不 听着... 不能耍花招
No, look... No tricks.

330
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:41,460
- 我自己能解决  - 怎么?
- I can handle myself.  - What?

331
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:42,660
- 真的?  - 真的
- Really?  - Yes.

332
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:46,300
你上次喝伏特加是什么时候?
When was the last time you did a shot?

333
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,600
我才没有... 是Hughes的退休派对
I don't... It was Hughes's retirement party.

334
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,130
- 我们喝了三杯  - 哦 三杯? 才三杯
- We did three of them.  - Ooh, three? Three.

335
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,300
- 是的  - 在俄罗斯的传统里
- Yes.  - Well, in Russia it's customary

336
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,030
喝酒就要喝光一整瓶
to drink until the bottle is empty.

337
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,200
好吧? 这辈子能让你保持清醒 不得罪Sergei
Okay? This will keep us sober without insulting Sergei.

338
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,000
Neal 我才不需要你的特技杯
Neal, I don't need your trick glasses.

339
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,330
没问题 但是 呃
No problem, but, uh,

340
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,130
我想也许我不应该戴着脚铐进去
I probably shouldn't walk in there with this.

341
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,060
谢谢
Thank you.

342
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:16,000
他不在这儿
He isn't here.

343
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:19,500
Neal Caffrey! 你个混蛋
Neal Caffrey! You bastard.

344
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,260
我和他妹妹好过 是个芭蕾舞演员
I dated his sister. The ballerina.

345
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:24,260
为啥你的恋爱史到头来总能影响到我?
Why does your love life always end up affecting me?

346
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,400
在他暴露咱俩身份之前把他弄走
Get him out of here before he blows our cover.

347
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,700
- 然后在外面等我  - 嘿!
- And wait for me right outside.  - Hey!

348
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,560
Dimitri! 见到你很高兴
Dimitri! So good to see you.

349
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:33,530
你再没给我妹妹打过电话
You never call my sister.

350
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,400
- 我应该宰了你  - 好了 好的
- I should kill you.  - All right, okay.

351
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,730
别紧张 好吧?
Take it easy now, all right?

352
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,900
我们都知道我只是大多数中的一员
You and I both know I was one of many.

353
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,030
你什么意思 "大多数中的一员"?
What do you mean, "one of many"?

354
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,230
我妹妹是圣徒
My sister is a saint.

355
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,730
- 我演得怎么样?  - 很好
- How was that?  - It was perfect.

356
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,100
- 好得不能再好了  - 口音是不是太重了?
- It could not have gone better.  - Was the accent too thick?

357
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,630
不 没有 很好了
No, it wasn't. It was great.

358
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,000
你肯定能通过"屋顶上的提琴手"试镜
You're gonna nail that Fiddler on the Roof audition.

359
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:48,900
- 谢谢  - 试镜加油 伙计
- Thanks.  - Break legs, kid.

360
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,930
嘿 我把脚铐和Peter都甩了
Hey, I ditched the anklet and Peter.

361
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,260
我这就过去
I'm on my way.

362
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:58,360
你那个花言巧语的朋友呢?
Where is your fast-talking friend?

363
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,960
哦 有急事呢
Oh, something urgent came up.

364
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:02,660
你知道经纪人... 总是到处灭火
You know agents... always putting out fires.

365
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,830
嗯 我们要鱼子酱 烤肉串
Uh, bring us the caviar, shashlik,

366
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,960
再来一碟腌蘑菇
and a plate of pickled mushrooms.

367
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,560
- 所以 你叫Peter Nevins  - 没错
- So, Peter Nevins  - Yeah?

368
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,330
是明星花样滑冰教练
Figure skating coach to the stars.

369
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,400
Nikolai 过来
Nikolai.

370
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:23,700
只有一点问题
There is just one little problem.

371
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,830
是什么?
What's that?

372
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,230
你似乎并不存在
You don't seem to exist.

373
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,730
如果都没有你这个人
Now, how can you be famous

374
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:48,030
你是怎么有名的呢?
if you don't exist?

375
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:51,860
这倒是真的
That's true.

376
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:54,830
Peter"Neevens"确实不存在
Peter"Neevens" doesn't exist.

377
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,060
但是... Peter Nevins...
But... Peter Nevins...

378
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:00,800
这么拼 N-e-v-i-n-s...
N-e-v-i-n-s...

379
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,630
存在
he does.

380
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:10,460
这是个可以理解的错误
It's an understandable mistake.

381
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:12,960
如果把让我用西里尔字母的键盘
If I were put in front of a cyrillic alphabet keyboard,

382
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,730
我... 嗯 我不能
I'd... well, I wouldn't...

383
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,360
我也拼不出"为了我们的健康"
I wouldn't be able to get past na zdorovie.

384
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,800
为了我们的健康
Na zdorovie.

385
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,260
你可能认为
You'd think art crimes

386
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,630
艺术品犯罪小组更需要舒适的办案环境
would call for a more aesthetically pleasing setup,

387
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,000
但我们选了华尔街附近的地方
but we take a backseat to Wall Street.

388
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,260
下午好 Caffrey探员
Good afternoon, Agent Caffrey.

389
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:32,600
这是June
And this is June.

390
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,160
我们部门没她就无法运行
Our office couldn't function without her.

391
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,500
- 他可没夸大其实  -  Lowe女士
- He's not exaggerating.  - Ms. Lowe.

392
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,530
Gruetzner特工 我们正恭候您的到来
Agent Gruetzner. We've been expecting you.

393
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,200
我和Gruetzner探员说过了
I filled Agent Gruetzner in on our talk.

394
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,700
我对我们局可能造成的麻烦表示抱歉
I'm sorry for any problems the bureau may have caused.

395
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,160
这里有你要的证明信
I have the letter you requested,

396
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,460
还有我的名片
along with my card,

397
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:47,400
以防任何潜在的雇主
in case any potential employers

398
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,860
需要电话查证
need to call to verify.

399
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:50,530
谢谢 呃...
Thank you. Uh...

400
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,000
但我还是希望能有个交代
but I'm still looking for closure.

401
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,260
我还有一些问题
I have some questions.

402
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:57,460
我们能单独谈谈吗?
Could we, um, speak privately?

403
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:01,460
事实上 我们有些事要跟你说
Actually, there's something we'd like to talk to you about.

404
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,460
你结婚了 是吗?
You're married, yes?

405
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:10,230
- 是的 非常幸福  - 那很好
- Yeah. Happily.  - That's good.

406
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,430
因为 Katya是很多
Because Katya is a woman

407
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,860
男人的梦中情人
many men desire.

408
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:16,500
她以前有个教练是单身
She once had a coach who was single.

409
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,100
他们整天练习
They would spend hours practicing,

410
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,460
经常练到深夜
often late into the night.

411
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:23,530
非常晚
Very late.

412
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,900
他现在滑得可不咋样了
He no longer skates so well.

413
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:31,430
嗯 那你应该看看如果我错过晚餐
Well, you should see what my wife does to me

414
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,730
我老婆会怎么教训我
when I miss dinner.

415
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,330
- 那很好  - 是的
- That's good.  - Yeah.

416
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,400
- 嗯 有时候  - 是的
- Well, sometimes.  - Yeah.

417
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,800
噢
Oh. 

418
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:44,930
但是现在法典都不知道
But the codex has been hidden away

419
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,530
被藏到了哪里
its entire existence.

420
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,360
法典的主人严格禁止任何人打开它
The owner strictly forbade anyone from opening it.

421
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,600
你们... 是怎么弄到副本的?
How... how did you get a copy?

422
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,030
这是机密
That's classified.

423
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,000
恐怕你只能知道一些基本情况
I'm afraid you're on a need-to-know basis.

424
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,600
就是说 我们需要知道你所知道的
As in, we need to know what you know

425
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,930
而你却不能反过来
and not the other way around.

426
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,400
如果你愿意的话
If you're willing,

427
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,630
联邦调查局需要你的协助
the FBI would like your assistance

428
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,860
来破解它的含义
deciphering its meaning.

429
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:05,330
它可以帮助解决一个重大案件
It could help us solve a very serious case.

430
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,660
还有一件小事必须要跟你
There is one small matter that you need to be

431
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:12,560
说清楚
made aware of.

432
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,660
有一个非常危险的罪犯
There's a dangerous criminal

433
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,600
想要法典里的情报
who wants the information in the codex,

434
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,700
我们得弄清楚为什么
and we need to figure out why.

435
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,000
时间宝贵
And time is of the essence.

436
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,900
你知道吗? 你喝起酒来像俄国人
You know what? You drink like Russian.

437
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,100
- 谢谢  - 嗯 差不多
- Thank you.  - Well, almost.

438
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,100
你从明天开始工作
You start tomorrow.

439
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,730
明天很好
Tomorrow's good.

440
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,600
- 很好  - 很好
- Good.  - Good. 

441
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:46,360
现在 我来给你点建议
Now, let me give you some advice.

442
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,600
只管滑冰 别管我的闲事
Stay on the ice and out of my business.

443
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,360
明白
Understood.

444
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:57,560
所以有个危险的罪犯
So a dangerous criminal is interested

445
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:59,100
对Mosconi法典感兴趣?
in the Mosconi Codex?

446
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,960
我们只是不想让你在毫不知情的状态下
We just wouldn't want to put you in harm's way

447
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,030
就以身犯险
unless you knew what you were getting into.

448
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,100
联邦调查局会保护你的
The FBI will protect you.

449
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,160
听着 我知道在你们看来
Look, I know I might just seem like

450
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,630
我可能只是个书呆子
another bookworm to you guys,

451
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,300
但我可以保护自己
but I can hold my own.

452
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,300
我只是需要时间考虑一下
I just need time to think about it.

453
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,200
你有我的名片 决定了就打电话给我
You have my card. Call with your decision.

454
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,960
但要快点
Just make it soon.

455
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,560
- 时间紧迫  - 我送你下去
- Every minute counts.  - I'll go down with you.

456
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,460
谢谢
Thank you.

457
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,230
我们还有两分钟!
We got two minutes!

458
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,830
恩 Neal?
Hmm. Neal?

459
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,730
人呢?
Neal?

460
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,560
嘿 顺利吗?
Hey. How'd it go?

461
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:47,860
我让你在门口等我的
I told you to wait right outside.

462
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:49,430
我知道 但我觉得你喝了那么多伏特加
Yeah, I figured you could use some coffee

463
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,760
喝杯咖啡比较好
after all that vodka.

464
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,360
我在街角找到个不错的咖啡馆
I found a great little place down the street.

465
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,330
那儿的图拉姜饼很好吃
Amazing Tula gingerbread. 

466
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,100
- 你醉了吗?  - 不 我没醉
- Are you inebriated?  - No, I'm not inebriated.

467
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,860
拿着
Here.

468
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:01,330
你去把车开过来
Get the car. You're driving.

469
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,830
知道吗 酒精会放大
You know how alcohol tends to amplify

470
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,300
某些性格特点?
certain personality traits?

471
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,530
- 把车开过来 Neal  - 就去
- Get the car, Neal.  - I'm on it.

472
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,300
那个Peter Nevins的简历做得不错
Good work on that Peter Nevins bio.

473
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,860
幸好他们没提前五分钟搜索
It's a good thing they didn't check five minutes earlier.

474
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:16,760
那时候数据还在上传
We were still uploading.

475
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,130
Neal开小差了 对吧?
Neal took off, didn't he?

476
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,860
没错 我想跟着他的
Yeah, he sure did. I wanted to follow,

477
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:22,300
但又不放心留你一个人在里面和Sergei会面
but I didn't want to leave you in there with Sergei.

478
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,860
找出他去了哪儿
Find out where he went.

479
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:26,060
明白
Will do.

480
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,860
早上好
Morning.

481
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:39,430
- 有时间吃早饭吗?  - 我快迟到了
- Time for breakfast?  - Uh, I'm running late.

482
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,800
有一叠大小跟畸形婴儿一样的
I've got a stack of ASAC files

483
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,960
主管文件等着我去看呢
the size of an oddly shaped child.

484
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:49,000
要知道 我们当时说到这份工作的时候
You know, when we, um, we talked about this job,

485
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,830
我还以为是...
I was actually thinking, "wow...

486
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,900
"预先安排好的日程
predictable schedule.

487
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,200
合理的工作时间"
Reasonable hours."

488
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:59,860
结果又变成了从早到晚加班加点
And now it's back to late nights and early mornings

489
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:03,330
还得去喝伏特加
and vodka rooms.

490
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,860
更不用提那些穿着小短裙的花样滑冰选手
To say nothing about the figure skaters in short skirts.

491
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:08,230
噢 她们不合我胃口
Well, she's not my type.

492
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,460
我更喜欢小鹿斑比那样的
I'm more into the bambi kind of thing.

493
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:13,100
对啊 两手不协调 随便乱挥
Mm, the uncoordinated limbs sprawled.

494
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,100
正是如此
Exactly.

495
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,100
你没事吧?
You okay?

496
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:24,230
亲爱的...
Hon...

497
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,900
你每天出门工作...
every day you're in the field...

498
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,400
而我每天...
every day, I...

499
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,330
晚上没听到你回家
I can't exhale until I hear you

500
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,430
就没法松这口气
walk through that door at night.

501
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,530
我不喜欢这种感觉
And I don't like that feeling.

502
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:41,730
Siegel探员被谋杀只是随机的暴力事件
Agent Siegel's murder was a random act of violence.

503
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,530
可能发生在任何人身上
Could have happened to anybody.

504
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,060
没错
Mm-hmm.

505
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:50,460
但我不会出事的
But it's not gonna happen to me.

506
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:51,930
我保证
I promise.

507
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:58,760
没事了吧?
We good?

508
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,330
我迫不及待想听你给她些什么建议了
Can't wait to hear your notes on how to improve that.

509
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,630
我不会给训练建议
I don't have to give notes.

510
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,700
只是在假装罢了
I only have to pretend to give notes.

511
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,300
临时抱佛脚
Mm, kneeling at the anklet of the master

512
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,660
看来还是有用的
has taught you well.

513
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:18,260
所以大师在嚼口香糖?
The master is chewing gum?

514
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:19,460
我在进入角色
I'm getting into character.

515
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:20,700
- 这样  - 我是Neal Micali
- Oh.  - I'm Neal Micali.

516
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,930
他紧张的时候就会嚼口香糖
He chews gum when he's nervous.

517
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,730
我可不需要背景故事
I don't need a backstory.

518
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,560
我去找找看Sergel做假护照的工作室
I'm gonna go try to find Sergel's passport workshop.

519
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:30,000
嘿... 动作快点
Hey... make it quick.

520
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,800
Sergei不喜欢别人在这儿乱晃悠
Sergei doesn't like anyone nosing around.

521
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,860
你还是省省力气做教练吧
Save your coaching for the ice.

522
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:36,560
准备好了吗 教练?
You ready, coach?

523
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,100
好了
Yeah.

524
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,300
你可以相信我们
You can trust us.

525
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,600
但你得老实告诉我
But you have to tell me everything

526
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,430
Sergei在做什么生意
about Sergei's business.

527
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,860
我只知道他带了很多坏人
All I know is that he brings terrible people

528
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,730
来小奥德萨
to Little Odessa.

529
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,230
他想控制这块地方
He wants to control it.

530
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,760
所有人都害怕他
Everyone is scared of him.

531
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,900
那你为什么要和他在一起?
Then why are you with him?

532
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,660
起初他是个好人
In the beginning, he was a good man.

533
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:00,700
我从莫斯科搬过来和他住一起
I moved from Moscow to be with him.

534
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,500
现在他把我当成了所有物
Now he treats me like possession.

535
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,300
上星期 他觉得我在外面沾花惹草
Last week, he thought I cheated on him.

536
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:12,730
所以他... 打了我
So he... hit me.

537
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,100
接着第二天 他就跟什么都没发生过似的
And the next day, like nothing happened,

538
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,160
要我嫁给他
he asks me to marry him.

539
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,600
你怎么说的?
What did you say?

540
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,430
如果我答应了...
If I say yes...

541
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,100
这辈子就完了
I'll be miserable forever.

542
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,700
但如果我拒绝了...
And if I say no...

543
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,660
就死定了
I'm dead.

544
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,060
你是我的教练
You're my coach.

545
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:44,030
有什么建议?
You have advice?

546
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,130
嘿 Piotr!
Piotr!

547
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,300
嘿 Sergei
Sergei.

548
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,760
我以为你不会来得那么早呢
I didn't expect you here so early.

549
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:50,600
你觉得我会看都不看
You think I could just let you coach

550
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:55,500
就让你做我最爱女人的教练吗?
the love of my life without a little observation?

551
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,800
我很好奇你怎么看
I'm curious to know what you think.

552
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:09,260
Katya做后内跳的时候有些问题
So Katya's had trouble executing her salchow.

553
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:11,530
我觉得问题出在她用内刃落地时
In my opinion, the problem is her center of gravity

554
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,030
自己的重心
when she lands on the inside edge.

555
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,000
那可是大问题
Well, that would be a problem.

556
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:19,330
后内跳跳时一般都是用外刃着地的
The salchow always lands on the outside edge.

557
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,360
她只需要小小调整一下
All she needs is a slight adjustment.

558
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:26,560
三周跳时 她用于平衡的那只脚
The extension of her free foot on the three spin

559
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:29,330
伸得不够开
tends to be a bit shallow.

560
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,930
好了 看你的了
Okay. Work your magic.

561
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:36,200
听我说 落地时
Now, listen, make sure

562
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,100
把那条腿伸展开来
that you keep that extension long.

563
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,700
伸展开来
Think long.

564
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,400
试试看 相信自己 好吗?
Go skate. Trust yourself, all right?

565
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,830
别忘了盯紧这个家伙
Don't forget to keep an eye on this guy.

566
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:47,860
跳
And push.

567
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,300
不错 不错
Not bad. Not bad.

568
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,500
但也不完美
But not perfect either.

569
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,700
比赛时你必须做到完美
In competition, you gotta be flawless.

570
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,400
我们会接着练习的
We'll keep working on it.

571
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,860
对她严厉点 她需要学学什么叫纪律
Don't go easy on her. She needs to learn discipline.

572
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,560
呃 Sergei
Uh, Sergei.

573
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:29,760
我包里带了冰球鞋
I got my hockey skates in the bag.

574
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:33,660
Katya可以休息一下 我们俩赛一场
Katya can take a break while I give you a few pointers.

575
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,560
你们美国人就是这样失去优势的
That's why you Americans are losing your edge.

576
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:39,130
总是玩 不工作
All play and no work.

577
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,030
好吧 我明白了 明白了
Oh, okay. I get it, I get it.

578
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,460
你是不想让历史重演
You don't want a repeat of miracle on ice.

579
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:48,460
美国队重挫俄国队
The U.S. kicks Russia's ass again.

580
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:53,160
这可是俄国人心里永远的痛 Peter
That's an open wound for many of my countrymen, Peter.

581
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,500
把我的冰球鞋拿来 我们冰场上见
Get my skates. See you on the ice.

582
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,560
太好了
Excellent. 

583
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,060
找到了
Bingo.

584
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,430
Jack 那是你97年在布鲁塞尔...
Jack, that is the same line that you sold Katarina...

585
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,000
- 嘿!  - 卖给Katarina的同一款式 对吧?
- Hey!  - In Brussels in '97, all right?

586
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,900
- 你在干嘛  - 嘿 我手机没电了
- Hey, you.  - Hey, my cell phone died.

587
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,230
明白吗? 能... 借下电话吗?
All right? Can... do you mind?

588
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,700
嘿 伙计 听着 我还在倒时差呢 懂吗?
Hey, pal, listen, I'm jetlagged, all right?

589
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,100
我们这就把事情解决
So let's close this out,

590
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,160
否则我就去找你的对手公司
or I'm gonna have to call your competition.

591
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:46,200
现在出去
Out. Now.

592
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,930
你知道这是什么吗?
Do you know what this is?

593
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,030
这是给Katya签约的条款记录
It's a deal memo for Katya.

594
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,260
一份不错的工资 奖金
A generous salary, bonuses and bumps,

595
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:55,200
旅行 美食 房子 衣服
travel, food, lodging, wardrobe.

596
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,560
你先别吵
Now, get lost.

597
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:58,330
否则你就去跟Sergei解释
Or you can explain to Sergei

598
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,100
Katya为什么要整晚哭泣了
why Katya will be crying into her sequins all night.

599
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,730
我听着呢 抱歉
Yeah, I'm back. Sorry.

600
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,430
没错
Mm-hmm.

601
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,430
稍等 Jack
Hold on, Jack.

602
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,660
给你两分钟 我再回来的时候 你最好已经走了
Two minutes. I come back, you be gone.

603
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:15,360
好的
All right.

604
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,560
对 对 我没挂
Yeah. Yeah, I'm still here.

605
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:23,030
只是稍微让我的耳朵清静清静
Just, uh, cleaning my ears out from all the manure

606
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:26,330
因为这十分钟你一直都在说废话
you've been shoveling into them for the last ten minutes.

607
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
能给你做示范可真是高兴
Oh, it's nice showing you how it's done.

608
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,860
五球四进 Peter
Four out of five, Peter.

609
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:42,960
祝你好运
I wish you good luck.

610
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,000
谢谢
Thank you.

611
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,160
好好看着球
Keep your eye on the puck.

612
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,630
一球
That's one.

613
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,400
真不赖
Not too bad.

614
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,200
但我们是三局两胜
But we're playing best of three.

615
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,030
玩五局三胜好了
Oh, let's make it best of five.

616
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:25,230
嘿 Vanya
Vanya. 

617
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,600
嘿 Seryozha
Seryozha.

618
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:49,730
怎么回事?
What the hell was that?

619
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,360
那球射偏了
That one got away.

620
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:54,500
知道吗? 你真是个疯子
You know what? You're a crazy person.

621
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,300
但我喜欢
But I like that.

622
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,800
我们明天接着比
I'll finish with you tomorrow.

623
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,030
我现在有生意要做
I have business to take care of.

624
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:14,430
Ivan被保释了
Ivan made bail.

625
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,860
我怎么不知道?
Why wasn't I told about this?

626
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:17,200
法庭放弃了诉讼
The court dropped the ball.

627
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,300
显然有人没看到
Someone didn't get the memo

628
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,660
我们要对此展开调查的备忘提醒
that we've got an open investigation.

629
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:21,060
说到这个 冰球王
By the way, Gretzky,

630
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:22,500
你是故意让球击中围栏的
did you mean for the puck to hit the wall,

631
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,760
还是你想打Sergei却射偏了?
or were you trying to hit Sergei and missed?

632
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,260
你该来靶场看看
You should come to the firing range.

633
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,700
相信我 他从来不会射偏
Trust me. He never misses.

634
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,500
谢谢
Thank you.

635
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,100
Neal拿的复印件上的名字
The names on the printout Neal grabbed

636
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,500
和俄罗斯情报局的监视名单上的人吻合
match fugitives on the Russian intel watch list.

637
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,030
冰球场和莫斯科之间
Calls between the ice rink and Moscow

638
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,530
上周通过不少电话
shot up in the past week.

639
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,600
看来Sergei又要招新人了
Looks like Sergei's bringing in new recruits.

640
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,130
他们用新身份
They'll be untraceable

641
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,560
安全通过海关后 就没法再找到他们了
the minute they get through customs with new identities.

642
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:42,030
然后呢?
Yes?

643
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,700
如果我们不尽快捣毁Sergei的组织
So if we don't crack Sergei's network soon,

644
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,300
一大群俄罗斯罪犯
a bunch of hardened Russian criminals

645
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,700
就会涌进美国境内
will go into the wind on U.S. soil.

646
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,100
已经进来够多了
Seems like enough of them already have.

647
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,430
走吧
Come on.

648
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,000
纽约警局今天早上把Ivan的尸体从东河
Ivan was pulled out of the east river this morning

649
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,700
捞了起来
by NYPD.

650
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,300
他们果然是要杀人灭口
They didn't trust him not to talk.

651
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,600
俄罗斯情报局同意引渡
Russian intelligence agreed to extradite

652
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:03,160
所有已经在纽约的Sergei的手下
all of Sergei's men who were already in New York.

653
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:04,760
如果有新护照
With the clean passports,

654
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,660
根本不可能找到他们
they're gonna be almost impossible to find.

655
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:08,700
我们以前处理过洗钱案
We've dealt with money laundering before,

656
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,930
但Sergei在洗人
but Sergei's laundering people.

657
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,330
所以... 我们怎么逮捕一群散布城市四处
So... how do we round up a bunch of fearless Russians

658
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,860
还毫无畏惧的俄罗斯人?
who are scattered throughout the city?

659
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:17,360
还得在他们互相通风报信前
Before they tip each other off.

660
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:18,860
这得耗费很多人力
It's gonna take a lot of manpower

661
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:20,330
做足准备工作
and a lot of preparation,

662
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,830
而且咱们时间不够了
and we're running out of time.

663
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,500
何不让Sergei自己把他们交出来?
What if Sergei brings him to us?

664
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,100
洗耳恭听
I'm listening.

665
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,360
这么说吧 哪件事是这帮人最无法抗拒的?
Well, what's the one thing his guys can't resist?

666
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:30,000
找个由头搞派对
An excuse to party.

667
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,830
那咱们就帮他们找个理由让他们好好庆祝庆祝
So let's give them something to celebrate.

668
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,100
好的
Okay.

669
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,800
或许我们可以给Sergei
Maybe provide Sergei with the answer

670
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,160
- 他一直在等待的那个答复  - 是说Katya吗?
- he's been waiting for.  - Katya?

671
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,560
要是连这么大的喜事
What kind of fiance would he be

672
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:39,730
他都不开个派对庆祝一下
if he didn't throw a party to celebrate

673
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,530
- 还算得上什么好未婚夫?  - 好主意
- the happiest day of his life?  - Nice.

674
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,960
的确不算 太好了
He would not be a good one. That's excellent.

675
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:45,960
咱们把他们同时召集到一处
We put them all together in one place at the same time,

676
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:49,360
顺便可以帮小奥德萨摆脱Sergei的控制
and we put an end to Sergei's grip on Little Odessa.

677
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,700
我答应
I'll do it.

678
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,830
好的 Katya
All right, Katya,

679
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:09,530
我保证你不会有事的
I will make sure that nothing happens to you.

680
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,030
但我必须知道
But I need to know from you

681
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:15,260
你是否为此做好了准备
if you are really up for this.

682
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:18,630
还是个孩子的时候我每天早上5点就要爬起来
I woke up at 5:00 every morning as a child.

683
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:21,460
在雪中走上6英里才能到体育馆
Walked to the gym in the snow six miles away.

684
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:23,830
练习的时候 我的脚趾在溜冰鞋里流血
At practice, my toes bled in my skates.

685
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,330
但我依旧每天强颜欢笑

这不算什么

Peter帮助我认清了我之前是多么愚笨

I can't believe it has taken me so long.

690

Ah, she sends her regrets. She came down with the flu.

699
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:27,560
太遗憾了 那只能婚礼上见了

I want him to be here for her engagement present.

709

可那样我就听不到你的精彩演说了
But I'll miss your speech.

710
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,600
放心 有人会录下来的

726
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:34,460
我想说的是
So what I'm really trying to say is,

你们都被捕了
You're all under arrest.

Peter Nevins根本不存在

746
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:32,960
看样子... 这些人同样如此
By the looks of it... neither do any of these people.

747
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:36,230
我认得你
Remember my face.

748
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,000
把他带走
Get him out of here.

749
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,930
看来...
So...

750
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,600
- 你要回因斯布鲁克了  - 嗯
- off to Innsbruck.  - Yes.

751
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:49,700
肯定会很有意思的吧?
That should be an adventure, huh?

752
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,800
- 希望如此  - 嗯
- Oh, I hope so.  - Hmm.

753

757
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,060
你自己都不知道自己在说什么吧?
Oh, you have no idea what any of that means, do you?

758
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:09,030
是不知道 在我拿来学习的解说DVD里有这句
No. A commentator once said it on my research DVDs.

759
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,560
说起来挺顺溜的
It sounded good.

760

Is there any reason he'd slip away to come here?

774
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,160
Neal来一定是有原因的
Neal always has a reason.

775
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:59,530
- 哦 嘿  - 嘿

What is this, sixth grade?

782
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,800
私以为 她没啥吸引人的
Personally, I don't see the attraction.

783
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:17,300
她不想抢劫你也不想逮捕你
She doesn't want to rob you or arrest you

784
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,900
也不想为保险欺诈起诉你

785
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,660
你就跟我说她都说了什么吧

要不这次你来?

798
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,800
只是惯例检查
Uh, just a routine call.

799
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:57,700
这附近所有办公室我们都查了一遍

也就意味着你做好决定了?
Does that mean you've come to a decision?

815
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:23,430
没错
Yes, it does.

816
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,730
我会帮助你们理解法典
I will help you with the Codex.

817

Really?

823
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,930
- 哇  - 我那时才19岁
- Wow.  - I was 19.

824
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,100
那学期是在马拉喀什
It was a semester in Marrakesh.

825
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,630
我在Menara花园
So I'm in the Menara Gardens,

826
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,760
那有些非常漂亮的绿瓦
and there was this beautiful green tile.

827
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:54,000
什么 在Saadian亭吗?
What, in the Saadian Pavilion?

828
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,830
没错
Yes.

829
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,530
它从屋顶落下
So it had fallen off the roof,

830
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,830
我装口袋里带走了
and I pocketed it.

831
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:02,730
我一直想送回去的
And I always meant to take it back,

832
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,400
结果回去的时候...
and then when I tried...

833
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,660
你被抓了
You got pinched.

834
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:09,460
那是我一生中最吓人的一夜
It was the scariest night of my life.

835
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:11,900
呃 什么 才一夜?
Um, I'm sorry, "night"?

836
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,300
单数?
Singular?

837
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,830
- 没开玩笑...  - 在监狱过上一夜?
- Believe me...  - One night in jail?

838
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,930
在摩洛哥的监狱待上一夜够受的了
One night in a Moroccan prison is enough.

839
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,060
好吧
All right.

840
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:24,700
听着... 我和获释犯共事过
Look... we've worked with ex-cons before.

841
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,730
跟你一样久经沙场的
Even seasoned, hardened criminals,

842
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,060
惯犯
like yourself.

843
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:29,260
没遇到监狱里的饥渴变态吧?
Did you have a prison bitch?

844
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:33,000
嘘
Shh.

845
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:34,600
抱歉
Sorry.

846
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,030
为了完全揭秘
And, in the interest of full disclosure,

847
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:43,300
我... 觉得法典的副本是不完整的
I... look our copy of the codex is incomplete.

848
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,530
哦
Oh.

849
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,100
你手头有多少?
How much do you have?

850
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,300
只有一个章节 第13章
A single chapter. It's chapter 13.

851
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,030
有什么特别的想法吗?
Does that mean anything to you?

852
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,360
- 你知道吗?  - 什么?
- You know what?  - What?

853
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:56,930
我受够了
I'm done with games.

854
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
受够了? 你说什么呢?
Games? What are you talking about?

855
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,800
我... 我有说... 我有说什么吗?
I... did I say... what did I say?

856
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:04,100
来啊 打开看看 第13章
Go ahead. Open it. Chapter 13.

857
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:13,700
找不到? 试试这本
No luck? Try this one.

858
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:23,400
Mosconi极度迷信
Mosconi was incredibly superstitious.

859
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,700
他所写的所有书中
In all the books he ever produced,

860
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,900
从没出现过第13章
he never wrote a chapter 13.

861
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,060
就是这样
That's it.

862
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:41,000
你的水性回来了
You're getting your sea legs back.

863
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,260
早就不灵了
Frozen sea legs.

864
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,100
咱们这样真的不要紧吧?
Is it really okay that we're doing this?

865
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,300
理论上讲 这是犯罪现场
Well, technically, it's a crime scene,

866
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,660
所以不要乱碰东西
so don't touch anything.

867
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:51,100
好吧 再教我一遍怎么转身
Okay. All right, tell me how to turn again.

868
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,760
好 只需在外侧冰刀上加些力道
All right, just put pressure on the outside blade.

869
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:54,930
很好 然后倾斜身体
Yes. And lean.

870
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,560
哦! 就像这样!
Oh! Oh, like that!

871
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:57,930
就是这样 没错!
There you go. Yeah!

872
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,430
很好 哇 等等... 哇!
Good. Whoa. Wait, wait... whoa!

873
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,730
我抓住你了 抓住你了
I got you. I got you.

874
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,930
哇
Whoa.

875
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,030
没事 我抓住你了
Okay. I got you.

876
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,760
是啊 你一直抓得住我的
Yeah. You always do.

877
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:10,230
好吧
Okay.

878
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:15,500

这下有点像咱们第二次约会了
Kind of like our second date.

881
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:32,130
还再美妙点呢
Little better.
