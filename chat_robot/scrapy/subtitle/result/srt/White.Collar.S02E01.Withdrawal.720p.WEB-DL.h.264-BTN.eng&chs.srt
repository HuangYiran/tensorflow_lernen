41

Your only choice is to serve out your time with me or rot in this place.

00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:03,440
市中心的互惠银行有着相似的布局 用着相同的安全系统
All midtown mutual banks have similar layouts and use the same security system.

130
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:05,270
- Renee Simmons小姐  - 先生们
- Miss Renee Simmons  - Gentlemen.

131
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:07,710
负责你们分行的安全工作...
Who's in charge of security for your branches...

132
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:11,020
她要求我们针对分行的安全性做个测试
requested that we conduct a test on that security.

133
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,280
您能解释一下原因吗?
Would you please tell us why this is necessary?

134
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:14,940
我们发现了一些漏洞
We found several flaws.

135
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:15,980
嗨
Hi.

136
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:22,530
嗯 唔 嗯 很多钱
Mm-mm-mm. That's a lot of money.

137
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,850
在地下室我通过了金属检测仪的检测
Basement access let me bypass the metal detectors at the entrances.

138
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:29,780
出纳箱有系统保护 但你们的员工需要提高警惕性
Teller cages are protected, but your employees need to be vigilant.

139
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,560
员工要把员工卡带在脖子上
Staff should wear badges around their neck.

140
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,480
别在腰间很容易被顺手牵羊
Clipped to their waist, too easy to lift.

141
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:36,280
你们正在使用的染色包很容易被识别出来
The old dye packs you're using are too easy to spot.

142
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:39,810
而且密码应该每天更换 而不是一周更换一次
And, guys, the passcodes need to change daily, not weekly.

143
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,870
你们每个人在上周都收到了一张这样的卡...
Each of you have received a card like this in the past week...

144
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,420
这个人自称"建筑师"
from someone calling himself the Architect.

145
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:52,140
我们相信在达拉斯 芝加哥和波士顿抢劫银行的 跟他是同一个人
We believe this is the same person who has hit banks in Dallas, Chicago and Boston.

146
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:54,970
如果他继续用同样的方式作案...
If he's operating under the same MO...

147
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,210
一周之内 你们中就会有银行金库被抢
one of your vaults will be emptied within a week.

148
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:01,370
这就是原因 那么让我们来拟定计划吧
That's why it's necessary. So let's strategize.

149
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,180
进行得很顺利嘛
That went great.

150
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,230
我想他们今晚肯定睡得很香
I'm sure they'll sleep soundly tonight.

151
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:09,280
那么他们开始紧张的时候 我该怎么安慰他们?
So, what do I tell them when they start to panic?

152
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:14,030
告诉他们 我们会保证他们的系统安全 而且联邦调查局也会帮忙
Tell them that we're shoring up their security and that the bureau is on it.

153
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,490
这在达拉斯 芝加哥和波士顿有用吗?
Did that help in Dallas, Chicago and Boston?

154
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,520
这是在纽约 我们一定能抓住他
This is New York. We'll catch him.

155
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,330
希望吧
I hope so.

156
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:26,320
"我们一定能抓住他" 只说了半截吧?
"We'll catch him." Your halftime speech?

157
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:29,110
- 你本该说些什么的  - 那个家伙太狡猾了 好吗?
- You could've said something.  - This guy is amazing, all right?

158
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,170
- 达拉斯那单就干得不错 芝加哥那单 简直就是件艺术品  - 波士顿呢?
- Dallas was good, Chicago, a work of art.  - Boston?

159
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,270
- 我至今没弄明白他是怎么做到的  - 真的?
- I still don't know how he did Boston.  - Really?

160
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:38,450
那我们最好尽快查明 我可不想让曼哈顿也遭洗劫
Well, we better figure out how, because I do not want to add Manhattan to that list.

161
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,670
- 你还好吗?  - 是的 是的 我还好
- You holding up?  - Yeah. Yeah, I'm holding up.

162
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,180
- 你确定?  - 嗯
- You sure?  - Yeah.

163
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:50,920
我要... 嗯 呃
I'm gonna... Mm-hm.

164
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,400
你在哪儿?
Where are you?

165
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,400
我们定了协议
We agreed on a protocol.

166
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,050
你用了变声器?
Are you using a voice changer?

167
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,480
在长椅上坐下 打开时代杂志 翻到国际板块
You sit on the bench, open the Times to the international section.

168
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:05,390
- 按照约定来  - 你用了变声器
- That's what we agreed on.  - You're using a voice changer.

169
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,140
难以置信
Unbelievable.

170
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:16,720
- 我没看见你翻开报纸  - 赶紧过来
- I don't see a newspaper open.  - Get over here.

171
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,250
你负全责哦 猫咪探长
It's your dime, Suit.

172
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,230
- Neal怎么样?  - 你跟他呆的时间不比我少
- How's Neal doing?  - You spend as much time with him as I do.

173
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,690
我需要他 我可全指望他了 很多人都指望着他
I need him. I am counting on him. A lot of people are counting on him.

174
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,750
他可不能出什么问题
And I don't need him going section eight on me.

175
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,410
得给他点时间
He's not exactly forthcoming.

176
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:41,650
Kate才死了两个月 谁能恢复得那么快
Kate's only been dead two months. No one can snap back that fast.

177
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:47,210
你的意思是 你俩都没有调查机场发生了什么?
Are you telling me the two of you aren't looking into what happened at that airport?

178
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:50,140
你该问问 "他怎么样了?"
The question was, "How's he doing?"

179
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:53,390
- 而不是"他在干什么?"  - 行 那你怎么想?
- Not, "What is he doing?"  - All right, then what do you think?

180
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:54,950
交换条件
Quid pro quo.

181
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,310
好吧 他有时会发抖
All right. He's got the shakes.

182
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:03,150
他脑海里回想之前发生的事 他就会害怕
He's flashing back to that moment in his mind and he's freaking out about it.

183
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,220
到你说了
Your turn.

184
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:10,600
依你所想 他还是会有些好奇是谁杀了Kate
As you may imagine, he's a little curious as to who may have killed Kate.

185
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,500
他是不是觉得杀Kate的人实际上也想杀了他?
Does he think whoever killed her was trying to kill him?

186
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,230
他这样想过
It's crossed his mind.

187
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:24,680
好吧 我会一直盯着我这边的情况
All right, I'll keep looking into things on my side.

188
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,590
在我发信息给你之前 让他一直忙着
Until you hear from me, let's keep him busy.

189
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,010
现在我们接了个复杂的案子 就让他负责这个
We've got a good case now. Let's keep him working on that.

190
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:34,310
- 我怎么做?  - 你是他朋友 你会有办法的
- How do I do that?  - You're his friend. You'll figure it out.

191
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,540
你离开这里后 所有东西原封未动
I kept everything as you left it.

192
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,110
- 我看还真和我离开时候一样  - 欢迎回来
- Exactly as I left it, I see.  - Oh, welcome back.

193
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,690
一想到你待在汽车旅馆 我就接受不了了
I couldn't bear the thought of you at that motel.

194
00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:01,340
另外 你都不想象不到你不在的时候这里是多安静
Besides, you can't imagine how quiet it is around here without you.

195
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,880
- 我时不时喜欢来点刺激的事  - 我也是
- I like a little, uh, excitement now and then.  - Me too.

196
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:10,570
- 谢谢你 June  - 不客气
- Thank you, June.  - Of course.

197
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,930
快来看
Let's see it.

198
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:18,080
- 有不少资料  - 我知道
- There's a lot.  - I know.

199
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,180
资料都在这了吗?
This is everything?

200
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:40,740
是 这是你查到的关于Kate 还有Fowler和指导员的所有资料 
Yeah. Everything on your search for Kate, Fowler, Mentor.

201
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,260
- 你有Alex的消息吗?  - 没
- You heard from Alex?  - No.

202
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:46,620
自从那次爆炸之后 她一直很低调 别怪她
Since the explosion, she's been laying low. Can't blame her.

203
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,940
她会出现的
She'll surface.

204
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,860
那音乐盒呢?
What about the music box?

205
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,380
- 根据记录 新来的猫咪女探员...  - 那是Diana
- According to the log, the new lady Suit...  - That would be Diana.

206
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,510
自从Peter从Fowler手中拿回音乐盒...
Diana logged it into evidence in your New York office...

207
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,370
Diana就把它放在了纽约办公室的证物处
after Peter recovered it from Fowler.

208
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:01,750
我看看它是不是在那里 那些炸飞机的人就是想要那个盒子
I wanna see if it's there. Whoever blew up the plane wants that box.

209
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,800
他们不会就此善罢甘休
They're not gonna let it sit in an evidence locker collecting dust.

210
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,480
我只要找到那个想要这个盒子的人 也就找到了杀害Kate的凶手
We find the person who wants the box, we find who killed Kate.

211
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,700
"建筑师" 是个响亮的绰号
The Architect. That's an excellent sobriquet.

212
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,020
- 是你回来的第一个案子吗?  - 是啊
- Is this your first case back?  - Yeah.

213
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:32,120
- 我想要个新昵称  - Mozzie不够响亮了吗?
- I need a new Nickname.  - Mozzie's not cutting it anymore?

214
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:37,190
叫"提问人"? 或者"怀疑者"?
What about, um, the Question? Or perhaps the Skeptic?

215
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,410
大忽悠?
Conman?

216
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:44,050
- 这个"建筑师"是个银行抢劫犯吗?  - 还很厉害
- The Architect, he's a bank robber?  - A good one.

217
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:46,210
你什么时候开始关心联邦调查局的案子了?
Since when are you concerned with FBI cases?

218
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:50,200
从你开始为警察做事开始
Uh, since you started spiraling into the dark place.

219
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:55,890
也许你还记得 在过去的日子里我曾与银行劫匪勾结在一起
And as you may remember, I have colluded on a bank heist or two in my day.

220
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,780
说说 我们都知道什么?
Come on. What do we got?

221
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:04,820
好吧 5年里干净利落地做了3件劫案 没留下踪迹和任何证据
All right. Three clean jobs in five years. No trail, no evidence.

222
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,010
我们就只有这些业务名片
All we have are these business cards.

223
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,690
是浮雕版的 经典
Embossed. Very classy.

224
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:12,950
这个A是什么? 我不知道这是什么字体
What do make of the A? I don't recognize the typeface.

225
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,200
鉴证科也查不出来
Forensics doesn't either.

226
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:17,740
这个是自定义字体 体现了他的狂妄自大
Custom font. That speaks to a high degree of hubris.

227
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,610
嗯
Mm-hm.

228
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,370
你怎么想?
What do you think?

229
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:23,120
字体细长倾斜 肯定是受西里尔字体影响
The elongated slant, it could be a Cyrillic influence.

230
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,630
有点俄罗斯字体 嗯
A bit of Russian. Mm-hm.

231
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:28,000
如果是你留名片 你怎么写呢?
If you left a calling card, how'd you sign it?

232
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:31,470
我从不留名片 那太无耻了 你会那么做吗?
I'd never leave a card. It's way too brazen. Would you?

233
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:34,220
你当然会
Of course you would.

234
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:38,560
更好的问题应该是 如果你是他 你会留什么样的名片?
The better question is, if you were him, what card would you leave?

235
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:46,400
- 早上好  - 在名片上找到些线索
- Morning.  - Found something on the card.

236
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:51,430
我想模糊派俄国画家大概有1000个吧
I'll take obscure Russian painters for 1000.

237
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,560
这字母A一定是受西里尔字体的影响
The A has a definite cyrillic influence.

238
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,770
我们的技术人员已经破解了这个
Well, our tech guys already cracked that one.

239
00:17:56,050 --> 00:18:00,040
如果"建筑师"是个疯狂的俄罗斯人 那也不能排除我们名单上的其他嫌疑人
If the Architect is a Mad Russian, that doesn't narrow down our list of possibles.

240
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:03,020
这人不是俄罗斯人 但很迷俄国画
Not a Russian, but a fan of Russian painting.

241
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,860
Ivan Aivazovsky 看他的签名
Ivan Aivazovsky. Look at his signature.

242
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:10,280
看看啊
Oh, look at that.

243
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,230
有了
Got it.

244
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:16,120
看你俩一起工作 合作很愉快嘛
Look at you two working together, look at that teamwork.

245
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,000
我们对每一个拍卖会进行挖掘分析 看是谁拍下Aivazovskys的画
We dug up every auction to see who's been bidding on Aivazovskys.

246
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,000
太好了 人不少啊
Excellent. That's a pretty thick list.

247
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:26,280
如果我们再对照这份名单和在达拉斯 芝加哥生意业务的联系...
What if we cross-reference people with a business connection in Dallas, Chicago...?

248
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,550
就这
Right here.

249
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,300
- 这样 名单简短了  - 就一个名字
- Yeah, the list gets shorter.  - One name.

250
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,810
叫Edward Walker
Edward Walker.

251
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,300
我们这就去拜访他一下 走吧
Let's go have a visit. Let's do it.

252
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,230
干得漂亮 干得棒极了
Good work. Good work.

253
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,200

- Whitney 拿我的支票簿来  - 我们不开罚单
- Whitney, get me my checkbook.  - The Bureau doesn't give tickets.

256
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,140

00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:40,110
- 你认得这个吗?  - 我可不是什么"建筑师"
- You recognize this?  - Oh, I'm not an Architect.

265
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,280
确实不是 但你的确有着大把时间去搞套利基金
No, you're just a hedge fund manager with too much time on his hands.

有3幅 你是不是想偷一幅?
Three. You thinking about stealing one?

270
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,870
根据你脚踝上那个装置
It's that device on your ankle.

271
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:02,590
联邦调查局一直密切监视你 你之前肯定犯过事
You must have been some kind of criminal for the FBI to wanna keep you so close.

272
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:04,930

I was.

273
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:12,090
喔 你把球打到切希尔码头了
Ooh, you sliced that one over into the Chelsea Pier.

274
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,650
要知道 那可不在我的打球许可范围里
You know, my permit doesn't cover that.

275
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:20,160
我了解到你在达拉斯 芝加哥 还有波士顿设了办公处

让我想出来? 我都不记得了
Off the top of my head? I have no idea.

Providing you can get a warrant based on some bizarre connection you've made...

283

288
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:11,410
向后挥杆前 你得动作娴熟

289
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:15,410

00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:45,710
那家伙在摩天大楼上打高尔夫 你说得没错 他真无聊
Guy's chipping golf balls off skyscrapers. You said it. He's bored.

297
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:48,780
所以他是为了一时痛快冒险犯罪吗?
So he's gonna risk prison for an adrenaline rush?

298
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,610
- 是  - 嗯

Cape cod? What a relief to meet someone else who's over the Hamptons.

320
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:04,270
就是 我总觉得我沉浸在菲茨杰拉德的小说中
I know. I always felt like I was in a Fitzgerald novel.

321
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,450
或者是因为我不是纽约人
Maybe it's because I'm not from New York.

322
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,010
咱俩真是一样
Kindred ex-patriot.

- As far as he says.  - He's putting up a facade, huh?

329
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,940
他肯定会 这是他的本性
Of course he is. It's his natural state.

330
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,540
问题就在于我不知道有多糟糕
Problem is I don't know how bad it is.

331
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,250
你怎么想的?

332
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,640
我想他心灵肯定受到重创
Think he went through one hell of a trauma.

333
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:42,320
我还在想他有没有做好准备面对...
I also think if he was ready for a straitjacket...

334
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:45,500
然后笑着对我说 "Peter 你要相信我 "
he'd be grinning and saying, "Peter, you have to trust me."

335
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,130
他要做回自己还需要些时日
Well, it's gonna take him some time to become himself again.

336
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,990
所以比起马撒葡萄园岛 你更喜欢楠塔基特?

- Does he know?  - Not how bad it is.

349
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,600
他知道我们被当局严密监控
Well, he knows that we're under enhanced scrutiny by the Bureau.

350
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:35,310
但他不知道如果我们把案子搞砸了 我就要失业了...
What he doesn't know is if we drop a case, I'm collecting unemployment...

351
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:39,730
他只能变卖麦考利・库尔金的画换钱了
and he's using pictures of Macaulay Culkin for money.

352
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:43,370
就在飞机爆炸之前

Neal正要离开

He stopped and he turned around and he was about to say something.

355
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,000
然后...
Then...

356
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,610
- 你觉得他要说什么?  - 不知道

- 我不知道 反正不重要了  - 我觉得这很重要
- I don't know. Doesn't matter.  - Well, I think it matters.

359
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:11,550
为什么? 反正也无从得知了
Why? It's kind of a moot point now.

360
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:12,890
对你很重要
It matters to you.

361

手机卡复制好了

365
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,650
真相伤人啊 Mozz

Oh, um...

376
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:14,120
- 那是定位脚铐吗?  - 准确的说是电子监控脚铐
- Is that a tracking anklet?  - Electronic monitoring anklet actually.

377
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,540
说来有趣呢
It's a funny story though.

378
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:20,230
几年前 因为盗窃和伪造艺术品 联邦调查局追捕我
A couple years ago, Feds came after me for everything from art theft to counterfeiting.

379
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,990
但他们只抓到了我伪造证券的把柄
They only got me on bond forgery.

380
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,920
- 我还以为你在联邦调查局工作  - 没错 跟Peter一起工作
- I thought you worked for the FBI.  - Oh, yeah, yeah, with Peter.

381
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,340
就是他抓住了我 两次呢
He caught me. Both times.

382
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,280
不管怎么说 今天是个好日子
Anyway, this is a big day for me.

383
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:33,350
我出狱以来 你是第一个跟我喝酒的女孩子
You're the first girl I've had a drink with since I got out of prison.

384
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:38,350
- 哇  - 没什么问题 对吧? 还是...?
- Wow.  - That's not a problem, is it? Or...?

385
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,030
我得走了
I should really go.

386
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,290
好吧 因为我说的? 你...?
Okay. Is it something I said? Are you...?

387
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:48,440
你知道怎么联系我 过得愉快
You know where to find me. Ha, ha. Have a good one.

388
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,500
假释期的Neal Caffrey 不太妙啊
Neal Caffrey on paper, not so great.

389
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,240
还有很多手续要办
It's a lot to process.

390
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:58,960
- 至少我们拿到了Walker的日程表  - 有什么发现吗?
- Well, at least we got Walker's calendar.  - Anything?

391
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:04,690
以往每次银行劫案发生前几天 他的日程表都标注成绿色
On the days of the previous bank heists, his itinerary is highlighted in green.

392
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:07,080
- 其他的日子是蓝色的  - 绿色代表钞票
- Usually it's blue.  - Green for money.

393
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:10,080
是吗? 象征手法我都生疏了
Oh, really? The symbolism had escaped me.

394
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:14,580
- 看看他明天的日程  - 中午在第一联合银行开会
- Look at tomorrow.  - Got a meeting at First Unity Bank at noon.

395
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:15,880
标注成绿色
Marked in green.

396
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,170
看来我们要抓住他了
I think we got him.

397
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,570
你碰巧遇到了她 然后她请你喝了一杯?
You happened to run into her and then she invited you for a drink?

398
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:27,890
我就爱纽约这一点
Gotta love New York.

399
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,660
是啊 然后她给了你手机卡的副本
Yeah, and then she handed you a copy of her SIM card.

400
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,580
我是个秘密线人 对吧?
I'm a confidential informant, right?

401
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:36,220
如果换成别人打探到这个消息 然后告诉你 你眼睛都不会眨一下就接受了
If someone found this on the street and brought it to you, you wouldn't blink.

402
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,310
我跟你说过 别做傻事
I told you, nothing stupid.

403
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:44,270
有消息说 明天中午Walker要对第一联合银行下手
Word on the street is that Walker's gonna hit the First Unity Branch tomorrow at noon.

404
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:48,560
- 你肯定吗?  - 是的
- You're sure about this?  - Oh, yeah.

405
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,950
全体人员准备就绪
We've got everybody in position.

406
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:00,740
- 你怎么肯定这家银行会被抢?  - 我们收到消息了
- What makes you sure this is the target?  - Word on the street.

407
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,560
我不明白 你为什么觉得这家银行不够安全?
I don't understand. Why don't you think this bank's secure?

408
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:06,440
他们还没来得及安装我们推荐的那些安全系统
They haven't had time to install the security we recommended.

409
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,400
- 你进去过?  - 还出来了
- Been inside?  - I'm very thorough.

410
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:12,650
我们重置了所有的金库门 现在密码每天一换
Well, we've reset the vault doors in all of our locations to change daily.

411
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:15,030
没有通行密码不可能进去
No way they're getting in there without the access codes.

412
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,580
他们可不是省油的灯
These guys have bravado.

413
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,440
达拉斯银行早上9点被抢 芝加哥银行在午饭时间被抢
Dallas was hit at 9 a.m. Chicago, at the lunch hour.

414
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:22,860
- 怎么回事?  - 西北门警卫中午去吃饭了
- What?  - The northwest guard takes lunch at noon.

415
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,340
- 这就是他们的突破口  - 第一小组就绪
- That's their point of entry.  - Team One is clear.

416
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:27,130
金库楼梯 安全
Vault stairwell, clear.

417
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:31,600
- 怎么回事?  - 声控警报器被触发了
- What do we got?  - Sound-activated alarm was triggered.

418
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,670
情况不明 正向金库移动
I got no visual. Accessing vault.

419
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:35,460
- 有可疑分子吗?  - 下面一个人都没有
- Do you see anyone?  - Nobody down here.

420
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,520
也许他们破坏了摄像头 逃过了监控
They could've disabled the detectors, bypassed those cameras.

421
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:41,390
全体行动 查出是什么触发了警报
All units go. Find out what triggered that alarm.

422
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:43,080
我们正在进入
We're moving in.

423
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,520
快上 快上 金库里有情况
Move it, move it. We got something inside the vault.

424
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:51,840
你肯定不会相信 在外面等我
You're not gonna believe this. Meet me outside.

425
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,400
Jones 看着监控
Jones, take the monitor.

426
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,850
- 怎么回事?  - 这是你们的演习训练吗?
- What's going on?  - This one of your bank tests?

427
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:02,170
- 什么意思?  - 这个放在其中的一个保险箱里
- What do you mean?  - That was inside a safety-deposit box.

428
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:05,020
- 谁的保险箱?  - Peter Burke的
- Whose name was on the box?  - Peter Burke.

429
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:08,810
有人在耍你呢 Burke 以后别再浪费我的时间了
Someone's messing with you, Burke. In the future, don't waste my time.

430
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,310
也别浪费我手下的时间
Don't waste my men's time.

431
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:15,530
看啊 这不是Burke探员和他的私人犯罪顾问吗
Well, well, well, if it isn't Agent Burke and his personal criminal consultant.

432
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,740
真是缘分啊
What a coincidence.

433
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:18,880
- 没想到你会来这 Walker  - 为什么?
- Odd seeing you here, Walker.  - Why is that?

434
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,470
我在街对面的尼克斯大厦开会
I have a meeting right across the street at Nix Towers.

435
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:25,530
好像我们错过了好戏 闹钟不错
I guess we missed all the excitement. Nice clock.

436
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:28,230
先生们 走吧
Gentlemen.

437
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:33,230
- 他耍了我 Peter  - 嗯
- He played me, Peter.  - Yeah.

438
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,150
现在我们有麻烦了
Now we got problems.

439
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,970
- 他们已经进去快一个小时了  - 嗯
- They've been in there for almost an hour.  - Yeah.

440
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:52,170
- 你说他们会让我们继续查吗?  - 跟司法部打交道 只丢了案子就算幸运的了
- You think we'll lose the case?  - With the Department of Justice, we'll be lucky if that's all that happens.

441
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:55,910
- 别这样 我们是被算计了 他们知道  - 他们觉得Peter应该知道
- Come on. We were set up. They know that.  - They think Peter should've known that.

442
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:59,270
这里是联邦调查局 Neal 没有把握 我们不会行动的
This is the FBI, Neal. We don't act unless we're sure.

443
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:01,140
Peter就是信了你
Peter trusted your lead.

444
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:14,600
- 今天不太顺  - 你说呢?
- So today was a bit of a setback.  - You think?

445
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:17,130
真是奇耻大辱
Took me a while to wipe the egg off of my face.

446
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:21,120
- 我们会抓住他的  - 他已经不归我们管了
- We can catch this guy.  - This guy is no longer our investigation.

447
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:24,730
真糟糕
This is bad.

448
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:27,890
有件事我想告诉你
There's something you should know.

449
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,430
那天在机场...
When we were at the hangar that day...

450
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:35,240
在那些发生之前 我本打算告诉你件事
before everything happened, I was gonna tell you something.

451
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,720
什么事?
What?

452
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,330
我不想再逃了
I didn't wanna run anymore.

453
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:46,860
如果我登上飞机 不管我得到了什么...
If I had gotten on that plane, regardless of whatever deal was made...

454
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:49,670
- 都不是真正的自由  - 为什么?
- it wouldn't have felt like freedom.  - Why?

455
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:51,310
因为那是在逃跑
Because it was an escape.

456
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,430
你说得对 Peter 我的生活在这里
You're right, Peter. I have a life here.

457
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:57,590
如果当时你能救Kate的话...
If there was something you could've done to protect Kate...

458
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,830
- 你一定会救的  - 我会的
- you would've.  - I would've.

459
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,610
就像我相信你能抓到Walker一样
The same way I know you can get Walker.

460
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:09,230
- 被坏蛋耍了很不爽 是吧?  - 特别是让自己的朋友看起来像白痴一样
- Not fun being tweaked by bad guys, is it?  - When your friend looks like an idiot.

461
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:11,380
- 你说什么?  - 不是说你... 你没有...
- What?  - Not that you... you didn't look...

462
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,440
- 就一小点  - 你只是... 好吧
- Little bit, yeah.  - You kind of... yeah.

463
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:16,860
好了 我们从头理一遍
All right, let's start from the top.

464
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:20,900
他为什么要送卡片去警告银行?
Why would he send a card to warn the bank?

465
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,520
- 向我们挑衅?  - 为什么要这么做?
- To challenge us?  - For what purpose?

466
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,480
看我们是不是他的对手 是个试验
To see if we're on his level. It's a test.

467
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,880
没有旗鼓相当的对手 游戏就没意思了
No fun playing unless you have a worthy opponent.

468
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:30,250
他想看看我们够不够格
He wants to see if we're as good as he is.

469
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,550
- 停一下  - 怎么了?
- Go back.  - What?

470
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,370
- 你说他在试我们  - 看看我们会怎么做
- You said test.  - To see what we'd do.

471
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,330
- 我们怎么做的?  - 我们测试了...
- What did we do?  - We ran the...

472
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,750
我们测试了安保系统
We ran the security.

473
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,510
我们帮他找到了安保的破绽
We revealed the bank's weaknesses to him.

474
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:47,220
我想知道抢劫案发生前局里有没有测试城里其他银行的安保系统
I wonder if the bureau had security tests on the other cities' banks before the robberies.

475
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,870
- 你打给谁?  - Jones
- Who are you calling?  - Jones.

476
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:52,420
说曹操 曹操就打电话来了 Jones 正想打给你
Oh, look at that, ESP. Jones, I was just calling you.

477
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:54,180
Peter 打开电视
Peter, turn on your TV.

478
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,740
- 怎么了?  - 三频道
- Why?  - Channel 3.

479
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:04,760
全市所有银行的36个警报系统全部被触发
City officals are reporting a total of thirty-six alarms have gone off in banks throughout the city.

480
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:08,390
- 情况十分危急...  - 全市的警察肯定都出动了
- There's serious speculation...  - Every cop in the city must be out there right now.

481
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:12,250
- 纽约警察局的电话没人接  - 他把我们都牵制住了
- I can't get anybody from N.Y.P.D.  - He's spreading us thin.

482
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:14,940
- 这又是调虎离山之计  - 那些银行并没有Walker的卡片
- It's another misdirect.  - None of these banks got Walker's cards.

483
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,910
- 他还是会对开始的五家银行之一下手  - 说得没错
- He's going after one of the initial five.  - You got that right.

484
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:22,260
- Renee说她重置了金库密码  - 如果没有她 谁也进不去
- Renee said she changed the vault access codes.  - No one can get in without her.

485
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:24,260
我们得抢在他们之前找到她
We gotta find her before someone else does.

486
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:27,790
请保持通讯线路通畅
Keep the lines of communication open.

487
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:35,780
- 晚上愉快  - 你也是
- Have a good night.  - You too.

488
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:39,740
不好意思 先生们 我们要下班了
I'm sorry, gentlemen. We're closed for the night.

489
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,660
请离开吧
You'll have to go now.

490
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:47,780
别急着走 女士 我们需要留条退路
Not so fast, lady. We need to make a withdrawal.

491
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,220
别动手
Get your hands off me.

492
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:51,960
- 放开我  - 闭嘴 把门锁上
- Let go of me.  - Shut up. Lock those doors.

493
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:59,630
- 快到第一联合银行了  - 就是在那里我们找到的闹钟
- Almost at First Unity.  - First Unity, where we arrested the clock.

494
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:02,770
那里的警报系统又被触发了 城里的银行有可能被抢劫
Their alarms are going off again. Banks in town are being robbed.

495
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:05,110
- 我觉得不是  - 你觉得这是个烟雾弹?
- I don't think so.  - Think it's a smokescreen?

496
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:07,440
嗯 Neal和我正在赶往中心互助银行
Yup. Neal and I are headed to Midtown Mutual.

497
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:10,090
- 互助银行是少数几个没有动静的银行之一  - 没错
- Midtown's one of the few that's silent.  - Exactly.

498
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,890
如果Walker的同伙在那里 你们单独行动太危险了
If Walker's crew are there, can't go without backup.

499
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:15,870
那就给我们派点增援 我有预感他们在找Renne
Then get us some. I got a feeling they're going after Renee.

500
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:18,900
- 好的 我会派特种部队过去  - 快走
- Okay, I'll find you a SWAT team.  - Let's go. Move it.

501
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,220
- 看到他们了吗?  - 嗯 看到了
- You see them?  - Yeah, I did.

502
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,490
- 你要去哪?  - 得找个突破口
- Where you going?  - Gotta break in.

503
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:34,740
- 谁告诉你进去的  - 就算我们能进这道门... 我们也进不去吧
- Nobody said anything about breaking in.  - Even if we could get through these doors... which we can't...

504
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:37,340
- 进去了也会被他们发现的 所以得另找门路  - 没有其他门路
- They'd see us. Go another way.  - There's no other way.

505
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,390
- 自从你测试了他们的系统之后 地下室就被封了  - 地下室只是最简单的进入方法
- We sealed off the basement after your test.  - The basement was the easiest way in.

506
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:43,680
- 最简单的?  - 还有别的方法的
- Easiest?  - There's always another way.

507
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:45,010
来吧 Peter
Come on, Peter.

508
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:01,260
- 看来Walker知道屋顶的通风口  - 嗯
- Looks like Walker knew about the roof vent.  - Yeah.

509
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:04,980
- 他有无线通讯设备  - 我们得速战速决
- He's got a radio.  - We're gonna have to do this quickly.

510
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,790
不能让他通知其他人
Before he alerts the rest of them.

511
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,780
联邦调查局 放下武器...
FBI. Drop your weap...

512
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,870
看来不能活捉了 警长
So much for taking them alive, sheriff.

513
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,310
- 他要告诉Walker我们在这里了  - 不会的
- Now he's gonna tell Walker we're up here.  - No, he's not.

514
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:19,960
立刻 放下武器...
Now, drop your weap...

515
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,080
- 放他走吧  - 我们得快点找到Renee
- Let him go.  - We gotta get to Renee.

516
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:27,120
- 枪法不错 Butch  - 谢谢 Sundance(著名腐剧"虎豹小霸王"里的角色)
- Good shooting, Butch.  - Thanks, Sundance.

517
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:33,940
好了 一 二 三
All right, one, two, three.

518
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:40,150
怎么样? 准备好闯入银行了吗?
What do you say? Ready to break into a bank?

519
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:52,490
你打算什么时候把你那些秘密通道都告诉我?
Were you ever gonna share your alternate access route with me?

520
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:53,660
不刚告诉你了嘛
I just did.

521
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,280
承认吧 Peter 我们是最佳拍档
Admit it, Peter. We'd make a pretty decent team.

522
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,680
- 抢银行的?  - 我看到你笑了
- Bank robbers?  - I see you smiling.

523
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,350
声名狼藉的Caffrey和Burke 我们会被传为佳话的
Come on, the infamous Caffrey and Burke. We'd be legends.

524
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:06,370
- 我都能想象出通缉令的样子  - 那也是先Burke后Caffrey
- I can see the wanted posters.  - It'd be Burke and Caffrey.

525
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:07,630
快走
Okay, move.

526
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:18,210
好了 撤退吧 同志们
All right, stand down, guys. Pack it up.

527
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:21,650
- 又是闹钟?  - 他们在城里的银行里都放上了闹钟
- More clocks?  - They're setting alarms off all over the city.

528
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,430
那你现在肯听我的了吧? 我们得尽快赶到中心互助银行
Now will you listen to me? We've gotta get to Midtown Mutual.

529
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,730
- 门卡本该还给银行的  - 幸好我没还吧?
- That was supposed to be returned to the bank.  - You glad it wasn't?

530
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,450
这边 这边
This way, this way.

531
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:48,420
- 打开金库  - 我在努力试了
- Open the vault.  - I'm trying. I'm doing my best.

532
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,460
- 那是Walker吗?  - 我认不出
- Is it Walker?  - I can't tell.

533
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,630
我在试了 不太记得
I'm trying. I don't remember.

534
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,810
有四人 都有枪 和Renee在金库里
Four of them, armed, in the vault with Renee.

535
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:16,050
把她带走 把她绑在办公室 绑紧点
Take her, put her in her office. Don't be stingy with the tape.

536
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,930
他们往回走呢
They're coming back.

537
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:46,520
楼梯下有个紧急出口 你分散他们注意力 我带她去逃出去?
There's an emergency exit off the staircase. Create the distraction, I'll get her to safety?

538
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:49,500
妙计 但不好 我带她出去吧
Good idea, but wrong. I'll get her to safety.

539
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,390
- 我知道怎么走  - 我有枪
- I know the layout.  - I have a gun.

540
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,970
你带她出去 我来分散他们注意
You get her to safety, I'll create the distraction.

541
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:00,740
- 妙计  - 我需要你的手机
- Good idea.  - I need your phone.

542
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:02,690
- 什么?  - 我要用到手机 拿来
- What?  - I'm doing a phone thing. Come on.

543
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,600
去吧 神探Harry(70年代经典警察电影)
Do your thing, dirty Harry.

544
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:40,850
没电了 检查下 确认外面没特警部队
Lights out in here. Check it out. Make sure SWAT is not outside.

545
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:42,400
我们出去看下
Let's check this out.

546
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:44,240
她逃不了的
She's not going anywhere.

547
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,860
- 别靠近前面窗口  - 看到外面有人吗?
- Stay clear of the front windows.  - Do you see anybody outside?

548
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,370
有人在这里面 我们去看看
There's somebody in the building. We gotta move.

549
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,530
下面
Down here.

550
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:16,020
你们是时候滚蛋了吧
Might be a good time for all of you to leave.

551
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:17,030
该死
Damn it.

552
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:25,050
- 我们被发现了  - 我们完成任务了 回来会合
- We got sirens.  - We're all done. Meet us back here.

553
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,910
- Burke探员?  - 嘘! 我会带你离开的
- Agent Burke?  - Shh! I'm getting you out of here.

554
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,890
- 我们在这  - 怎么那么久?
- We're here.  - What took you so long?

555
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:43,640
比计划晚了30秒 要赶快走了 拿着
We're 30 seconds behind schedule. We have got to move. Take it.

556
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:01,470
- Peter  - 貌似Diana让特警部队开窍了
- Peter.  - Sounds like Diana knocked some sense into SWAT.

557
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:03,440
- 我们带Renee离开这吧  - 他们从后门走了
- Let's get Renee out of here.  - They're out back.

558
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:04,950
- 没关系  - 我要跟着他们
- Doesn't matter.  - I'm going after them.

559
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:07,630
别跟了 他们有枪 Neal
Let them go. They've got guns. Neal.

560
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,650
该死 他从来不听我的
Damn it. He never listens to me.

561
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,830
- Jones 帮我叫Walker来 我要和他谈谈  - 他已经在这了
- Jones, get me Walker. I wanna talk to him.  - He's already here.

562
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:40,310
噢 我听说银行的事了 还觉得我能给你省点事
Oh, I heard what happened at the bank. I thought I could save you some trouble.

563
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,120
所以你是来自首的吗?
So you're here to confess?

564
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:48,290
我知道你会给我打电话 因为Caffrey先生肯定有我手机号
I figured you were gonna give me a call, because I'm sure Mr. Caffrey has my cell number.

565
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:49,530
Arthur 给他们
Arthur?

566
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:53,550
除了我公司的起诉之外 还有我的不在场证明
You'll find my alibi in there in addition to my company's lawsuit.

567
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:54,830
起诉?
Lawsuit?

568
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:57,510
对 毫无依据的骚扰和毁损名誉
Yes, unwarranted harassment, defamation of character.

569
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:59,630
还有一系列的其它起诉项目...
And, you know, there's a litany of other charges...

570
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,730
我还是不破坏这份惊喜了吧? 
But, gee, why spoil the surprise?

571
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,090
慢慢玩你的游戏吧
Enjoy this game you're playing.

572
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:07,690
- 你不会有好结局的  - 噢 游戏已经结束了
- It won't end well for you.  - Oh, the game is already over.

573
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:12,590
无论这个"建筑师"是谁 他都已经赢了
This Architect, whoever he is, has already won.

574
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:15,810
Caffrey先生 再见
Mr. Caffrey.

575
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:22,180
对了 如果真是我做的话 也会让我做联邦调查局初级探员吗?
Oh, if I did do it, do you think they would make me a junior FBI agent too?

576
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:30,770
- 哇 多嚣张的王八蛋  - 哼
- Wow, that is one arrogant bastard.  - Heh.

577
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:32,540
说得没错
That's one way of putting it.

578
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:35,420
这次棘手了
This is gonna be a problem.

579
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:46,960
- 录像没用  - 他们在五分钟内搞定了
- Nothing useful on the tapes.  - They were in and out in five minutes.

580
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:50,850
制造交通阻塞让警察无法及时到达 加上他们完美的撤退策略 
Gridlocked the city to kill response time. Plus they had a perfect exit strategy.

581
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:54,260
Walker操控着每一步 他也想让我们知道 
Walker was in control every step of the way. He wants us to know it.

582
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:57,000
我们也会这样逮到他的 他唯一控制不住的就是自大 
And that's how we get him. One thing he can't control is his ego.

583
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,740
他起诉不是因为虚荣 
Vanity is not cause for indictment.

584
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:01,660
你要抓我的时候 我也不敢胆大包天地走进你办公室啊
I wasn't bold enough to walk into your office when you were after me.

585
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:05,530
- 真想逮住这家伙  - 地狱的恐怖也及不上被惹怒的联邦探员
- I want this guy.  - Hell hath no fury like a Fed scorned.

586
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:09,200
我们被一个嫌疑犯进行几百万的起诉...
We are facing a multi-million-dollar lawsuit from a suspected thief...

587
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:12,240
却眼睁睁看着他在光天化日下逍遥法外
who walked away from the crime scene in broad daylight.

588
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:14,970
- 你是说我们没戏了吗?  - 最好不是 
- What, are you saying we're done?  - We better not be.

589
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:18,980
否则司法部就要砸掉我饭碗 然后赶你回监狱了
Or I can't stop the DOJ from putting me on the bread line and you behind bars.

590
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:22,040
他们在城里瞎跑的时候 我们在抓贼呢
While they were chasing ghosts around the city, we were right.

591
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,870
没办法 我们没抓到人
Doesn't matter. We didn't catch him.

592
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:26,330
最终数据
Final tally.

593
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:30,030
貌似他们偷走了820万
Looks like they got away with 8.2 million.

594
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:37,500
- 你确定?  - Jones写得清清楚楚
- You sure about that?  - Jones has excellent penmanship.

595
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:40,730
四个人 每人两个新秀丽箱
Four guys, two samsonites each.

596
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:45,550
- 你觉得那些箱多大?  - 不知道 16乘13吧
- How big would you say the briefcases are?  - I don't know, 16-by-13.

597
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,700
- 高呢?  - 四或五英寸
- Height?  - Four, 5 inches.

598
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,160
- 纸币面额都是100美元?  - 对
- Denomination of the bills, all Franklins?  - Right.

599
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:54,020
一叠一百张 每叠大小不超过8英寸
Hundred bills in a pack. Volume of each pack, less than 8 inches.

600
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,230
尺寸对不上
Dimensions don't add up.

601
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:58,820
那么每个箱子里就有大概96万美金
We're looking at around $960,000 in each case.

602
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:02,400
- 总数超过650万美金  - 实际总数是820万
- That's over 6.5 million total.  - Final tally was 8.2.

603
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:05,210
也就是有超过150万美金下落不明
Which means that more than a million and a half is unaccounted for.

604
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,240
似乎足够分成了
Sounds like enough to be a share.

605
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:13,690
- 谢谢  - 没关系
- Thank you.  - Sure.

606
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,730
谢谢你抽空见我们
I appreciate your taking the time.

607
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:17,370
你说有个推测
You said you had a theory.

608
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,330
那些戴面罩的家伙好像漏了些东西
Our faceless friends may have left something behind.

609
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:22,730
我想重新检查保险库 以防万一
I'd like to re-examine the vault, just in case.

610
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:24,940
没有好好休息下吗?
No rest for the weary, huh?

611
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:28,000
被那些疯子用枪指着脑袋 等你们抓到人 我才能安心休息
Those creeps held a gun to my head. I'll rest when you catch them.

612
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:35,940
这个团伙作案很周密 你觉得他们漏掉了什么?
The team was pretty thorough. What is it you think that they missed?

613
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:42,640
- 213  - 什么?
- Two-thirteen.  - Excuse me?

614
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:46,850
保险箱213 我很确定还没人查过
Deposit box 213. Pretty sure no one's looked in there yet.

615
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:48,460
貌似值得一看
It sounds like it's worth a shot.

616
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:51,720
噢 抱歉 那是我们其中一个客户的资产
Uh, I'm sorry. That's the property of one of our customers.

617
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:55,330
- 你需要他的授权或者搜查令  - 这是行长给的
- You'd need his authorization or a warrant.  - Got this from the bank president.

618
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:58,770
但这个保险箱不是你们客户的
But the box doesn't belong to one of your customers.

619
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,940
- 是你的  - 哈 哈 
- It belongs to you.  - Ha, ha.

620
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:02,990
我想你搞错了吧
I'm afraid you're mistaken.

621
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:06,830
没有 我们调查了这个保险库的所有箱子
No, we did a background check on all the boxes in this vault.

622
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:09,780
你知道213这个箱子两个月前租给你叔叔了吗?
Did you know 213 was rented to your uncle two months ago?

623
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:12,500
- 我觉得这没问题啊  - 有问题
- I don't see why that would be a problem.  - I do.

624
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,870
他两年前去世了 要么这是个奇迹...
He died two years ago. Either it's a miracle...

625
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:17,430
- 要么就是你伪造了他的申请  - 我打赌是后者 
- Or you forged his application.  - My money's on the latter.

626
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:23,460
好吧 那你们还是看一下吧
Okay, fine. Uh, why don't you have a look?

627
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:36,660
哇
Wow.

628
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:41,890
150万现金
One and a half million dollars in cash.

629
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:43,750
好
All right.

630
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:47,360
- 你知道她有枪吗?  - 不知道 
- Did you know she had a gun?  - I did not.

631
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:50,090
听着 拿那个袋子 把钱装进袋子里
Okay, get the bag. Put the money in the bag.

632
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:54,110
计划不错
Not a bad plan.

633
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:56,250
Walker给你分成
Walker leaves your cut.

634
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:59,280
你只要等事态平息后消失就可以了
All you have to do is walk out once the dust settles.

635
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,220
- 我认为是天衣无缝的计划  - 被我们发现就不是了
- Pretty good plan, I'd say.  - Except we figured it out.

636
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:06,400
- 你真觉得自己能逃过联邦调查局吗?  - 你的档案记录可是一场长跑 不是冲刺
- You really think you can outrun the FBI?  - Your record is a marathon, not a sprint.

637
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:09,170
- 他迟早会知道的  - 闭嘴 把钱装到袋子里
- He'd know.  - Stop talking and put the money in the bag.

638
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:11,820
你在监控录像里的演技不错
That was a pretty nice acting job you did for the cameras.

639
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:15,220
- 堪称完美计划  - 闭嘴
- Even the best laid plans.  - Shut up.

640
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:18,250
Walker说服你帮他 对吧?
Walker convinced you to help him, didn't he?

641
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,790
他说服我没必要等20年拿普通的退休金
He convinced me I shouldn't wait 20 years to have a mediocre pension to retire on.

642
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:25,500
现在就可以拿到三倍的钱 为什么还要等?
Why wait when I can have three times that?

643
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:28,200
- 因为你会被抓  - 都说了 他迟早会知道
- Because you'll get caught.  - Again, he would know.

644
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:29,630
不是叫你闭嘴吗?
Did I tell you to stop?

645
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:32,330
继续装钱
Keep filling the bag.

646
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:35,810
- 别再那样了 拜托?  - 怎么了?
- Could you stop doing that, please?  - What?

647
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:39,090
- 唠唠叨叨 揭人家痛处 真矫情  - 好吧 确实是
- Rubbing it in. It's very hypocritical.  - Well, it's not untrue.

648
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:40,470
- 喂  - 你知道吗?
- Hey. - Okay, you know what?

649
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:42,760
- 我厌倦这样了  - 厌倦做人质?
- I'm tired of this.  - Being held hostage?

650
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:45,070
- 厌倦和你吵架  - 我也是
- Bickering with you.  - You're not the only one.

651
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:46,300
- 真的吗?  - 真的
- Really?  - Yeah, really.

652
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,160
哇 好吧 我们断绝合作关系吧
Wow. Okay, maybe it is time for this partnership to end.

653
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:51,770
好啊 我没问题 终于可以不用管你的破事了
Okay, that's fine by me. I can finally start my novel.

654
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:54,660
- 我的破事? 你连一张违规罚单都不会写  - 知道吗? 你真是...
- Novel? You can barely write a parking ticket.  -  You know? That's very...

655
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:56,430
- 喂!  - 等等
- Hey!  - Hold on.

656
00:44:56,710 --> 00:44:58,430
- 你真的要绝交吗?  - 你呢?
- You really want this to end?  - Do you?

657
00:44:58,570 --> 00:44:59,820
- 我时刻准备着  - 绝就绝
- I'm ready.  - Let's do it.

658
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,180
闭嘴!
Shut up!

659
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:05,790
噢 我的眼睛
Oh, my eyes.

660
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,820
这里 我们在这里
In here. We're in here.

661
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:12,640
- 就在那 给她带上手铐  - 噢!
- Right there. Handcuff her.  - Oh!

662
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:14,950
- 给她念念她的权利  - 好的 长官 
- Somebody read her rights.  - Yes, Sir.

663
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,860
- 干得好  - 你也不差
- Nice job.  - Not so bad yourself.

664
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:27,090
Walker先生 这个是给你的
Mr. Walker, this just arrived for you.

665
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:33,750
现在扯平了 你起诉我们 我现在回赠给你
It's only fair. You gave us a heads-up. I'm returning the favor.

666
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:37,490
- 那我又可以继续起诉了  - 嗯 起诉不了了
- This is going to help my lawsuit.  - Mm. There won't be any lawsuit.

667
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:41,020
- 为什么?  - 你的内线 Renee供出你来了
- And why is that?  - Your inside woman. Renee talked.

668
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:44,020
现在赶紧认罪求情吧 要不得坐上25年牢了
Why settle for 25-to-life tomorrow when you can plea-bargain today?

669
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,730
噢 下次别被抓到哦
Oh, next time, don't get caught.

670
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:53,540
Whitney 打给Arthur 叫律师团
Whitney, call Arthur. Call the legal team.

671
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,170
Neal啊?
Neal?

672
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:10,820
你准备好了吗?
You ready?

673
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:15,820
现在准备好了
I am now.

674
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:30,990
我在公园看到一只知更鸟 然后你说"知更鸟是什么颜色的?"
I saw a mockingbird in the park. Then you say, "What color is the mockingbird?"

675
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:33,930
我可以用报纸做暗号 但鸟的那个蠢主意就算了
I'm doing the newspaper thing. I'm not doing the stupid bird thing.

676
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:37,620
- 他状态怎样?  - 好点了
- How's he holding up?  - Better.

677
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:41,020
- 我看到了以前的Caffrey  - 那就好
- I'm seeing the old Caffrey coming back.  - Good.

678
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:45,620
无论你扮演的是什么角色 你都做得不错
Whatever part you played in it, you did good.

679
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:50,140
我知道你叫我来这不单纯是为了表扬我
I'm sure you didn't call me down here to tell me how great I did.

680
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:52,370
- 不错 你做得不错  - 是很不错 非常不错 
- Good. You did good.  - Great. Great.

681
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:55,990
听着 我知道他不会对我坦诚的 我明白 他可是Neal
Look, I know he won't tell me everything. I get that, he's Neal.

682
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:59,680
我会盯着他 还有你
I'll keep an eye on him and you.

683
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:06,250
但那样我只有收拾烂摊子的份 而不是防患于未然
But that puts me in a position to clean up a mess, not stop it before it happens.

684
00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:09,130
所以你想让我来帮你防患
Oh, that's the part you want me to take care of.

685
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,850
告诉我他会不会做蠢事
Just tell me if he's gonna do anything stupid.

686
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:14,480
- 我不能出卖朋友  - 这是为了保护他
- I can't rat out my friend.  - It's to protect him.

687
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:18,080
盖世太保和克格勃组织也是这样说的
That's the same rationale that was used by the Gestapo and the KGB.

688
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:19,170
看着我
Look at me.

689
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:21,680
他也是我的朋友
He's my friend too.

690
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:26,900
- 我会考虑的  - 好
- I'll take that under advisement.  - Yeah.

691
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:36,040
- Mozz  - 我们得谈谈 朋友
- Mozz.  - We gotta talk, my friend.

692
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:37,410
- 什么?  - 是音乐盒的事
- What?  - About the box.

693
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,630
那个音乐盒出问题了
Something strange is going on with the music box.

694
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:40,820
是这样的
The trail starts here.

695
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:45,600
被包裹的音乐盒在你们纽约办公室的取证组存放了两个小时
It was bagged after forensics held it for two hours in your New York office.

696
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:49,830
- 然后职业督察处要求把它送去华盛顿  - 我就知道他们不会把它留在这儿
- Then OPR requested it be transferred to D.C.  - I knew they wouldn't let it sit still.

697
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:53,700
就在运送的过程中发生了些事情
Somewhere between here and there, this happened.

698
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:56,560
这不是原来的音乐盒 只是形状和颜色相似而已
That's not the box. Got a similar shape and coloring.

699
00:47:56,670 --> 00:47:59,460
- 它被换了  - 真的那个已经被带走了
- It was swapped.  - And the real box is in the wind.

700
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:03,350
虽然我们改变不了风向 但可以调整船帆
Though we cannot change the direction of the wind, we may adjust our sails.

701
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:07,480
问题是 我们往哪个方向前进?
Well, the question is, which way are we headed?

702
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:13,060
- 喂?  - Diana吗?
- Yeah?  - Diana.

703
00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:16,640
你准备好参加Fowler的神秘会议了吗? 我在路上了
You ready for Fowler's mystery meeting? I'm on my way.

704
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:19,720
我随后就到 头儿
I'm right behind you, boss.

705
