00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want a glass of water?

107
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:37,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

108
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks.

109
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:55,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, did you just moved to L.A.?

110
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I've been here for a while.

111
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are just new here?

112
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's Benicio's father.

113
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where is he?

114
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's in prison.

115
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you do?

116
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I drive.

117
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like a limo driver?

118
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, like for movies.

119
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:37,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You mean all those car chases and stuff?

120
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:39,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

121
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:40,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Isn't that dangerous?

122
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's only part time.

123
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Mostly I work at the garage. - Where?

124
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Receda Boulevard.

125
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:09,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I gotta go.

126
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ok.

127
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:16,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks for the water.

128
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Say bye. - Bye.

129
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:58,580


130
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:03,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chicken Chowmein? And, some Peking duck.

131
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:05,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ok. Where are the chopsticks?

132
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:08,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You know the guy just... - Go get 'em. Go get 'em.

133
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't want that. I don't want that.

134
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You need it. Chopsticks and a fortune cookie.

135
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:16,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Put out the fucking cigrette, I'm eating.

136
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Sorry. - What's the matter with you?

137
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just...

138
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Never have a ashtray in this town.

139
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You run a perfectly good business.

140
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know, why you wanna change now.

141
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:31,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know how much my business made last year?

142
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}30 grand.

143
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:35,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can build a car in six months and

144
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:38,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in six seconds these jerks write it off as a stunt,

145
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that won't even make it to the movie.

146
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:44,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See, all I need is a hard used star car.

147
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:45,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's all.

148
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:50,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I figure we start off small town circuit, we work our way up.

149
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:53,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Once we get to the show, we are talking millions.

150
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:53,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chopstick, sir.

151
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:56,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, where's the cookies?

152
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Forget it, forget it.

153
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, you still haven't give me your number.

154
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:05,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alright, four hundred thirty thousand dollars.

155
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Ross, I wouldn't come to you with this

156
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}unless I'm absolutely sure about it!

157
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How can you be sure, Shannon.

158
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you got that the big professional race team don't?

159
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got the driver.

160
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You just told me there haven't got a dozen drivers.

161
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:25,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not like this one.

162
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This kid is special.

163
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:29,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Been working with him for a while,

164
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've never seen anybody like it.

165
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:32,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I had the money, I'd back him myself.

166
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, but you don't have the money.

167
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Ross, you put this kid behind the wheel,

168
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}there's nothing he cannot do.

169
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's money here, you can't lose.

170
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck you eating chink food in my fucking restaurant?

171
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:50,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's a Jew doing running a pizzeria?

172
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You remember Shannon?

173
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:57,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take a fucking hike.

174
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:59,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wanna talk to my partner.

175
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:04,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just fucking with you.

176
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How're you doing, Shannon?

177
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How's the fucking leg?

178
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've paid my debt.

179
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:15,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll think about it. Okay?

180
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I wanna meet the kid first.

181
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:18,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's all I ask.

182
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:33,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}C'mon, I want you to meet somebody.

183
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whatever you do like about the car, don't say anything.

184
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want to drive the price down a little bit.

185
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:41,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kid, I want you to meet Mr. Bernie Ross.

186
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nice to meet you.

187
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My hands are a little dirty.

188
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So are mine.

189
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Good driving out there. - Thanks.

190
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:06,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good kid. So? What do you think?

191
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do we get the 400?

192
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll give you 300 for 70 percent.

193
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Done!

194
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:22,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You won't be sorry!

195
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:30,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm Shannon, can I help you?

196
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey pal, just drop it down here.

197
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're pushing it alright.

198
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:45,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We wanna push her into number three.

199
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:47,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- The car. Not you. - Good.

200
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hi. - Hi.

201
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:54,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You two know each other? - Don't.

202
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at that.

203
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We're neighbours. - Neighbours, very good.

204
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:00,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, we'll try to be neighbourly too.

205
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You blinked.

206
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

207
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:27,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Can I call a cab from here. - Yeah, sure.

208
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What am I talking about.

209
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:33,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You and the kid are neighbours, right? He can take you.

210
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. I feel bad.

211
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no. Don't even think twice about it.

212
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He'll be happy to do it.

213
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's a good guy.

214
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:45,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, he walked into my shop here about five or six years ago.

215
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:48,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right out of the blue, asking for a job.

216
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:51,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, I put him to the test, to see what he could do.

217
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The kid is amazing.

218
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:57,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, I hired him on the spot.

219
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:00,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At about half the wages I normally pay.

220
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:02,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He didn't even blink an eye.

221
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:05,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey kid, come over here for a sec, would you.

222
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I have been exploiting him ever since.

223
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't tell him.

224
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:16,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Looks like we've bigger problem than I thought.

225
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:19,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're gonna have to keep the car here for a few days.

226
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, I offered your services

227
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to take Benicio and Irene home.

228
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Would that be okay?

229
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, sure.

230
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:35,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I don't have wheels on my car. - Ok.

231
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:38,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's one think you should know about me.

232
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:38,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well put the tyres on.

233
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:41,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You got about five minutes? - Yeah.

234
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, do you wanna see something?

235
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

236
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

237
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:23,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Back against the wall and ours

238
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:27,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With the strength of a willing to cause

239
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:30,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A pursuit some called outstanding

240
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:35,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or emotionally complex

241
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Against a grain

242
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:40,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Left to stop at claims

243
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:44,960

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you, have proved, to be

245
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:59,150

246
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:08,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A real human being, and a real hero

247
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A real human being

248
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:23,470


249
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:27,680

251
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:35,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}From the slowly sinking ship

252

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A real human being

258
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:15,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was good. We had a good time.

259
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Me too.

00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:35,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, if I put you on the spot showing up like that.

261
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:36,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's okay.

262
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:02,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not doing anything this weekend.

263
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:09,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you wanna a ride or something.

264
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:46,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry about her bumps and bruises.

265
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thats fiber glasses, that's easily replaceable.

266
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:51,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We coat a paint on there with sponsors detail.

267
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at the thread on the tyre,

268
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}still good huh, we are in business.

269
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:59,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You paid 300 fucking grand for this piece of shit?

270
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:02,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I paid for it, out of my own pocket.

271
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:03,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is just the shell.

272
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:06,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the inside that counts. Not the outside.

273
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right, Shannon?

274
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:08,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are correct sir.

275
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck that shit. If I paid 300 for something,

276
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want everybody to see it.

277
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course you do.

278
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now this.

279
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:18,680

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}motherfucker!

281
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Damn!

282
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shannon, sell him that car.

283
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:27,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He won't be able to find a pussy in a whorehouse.

284
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:31,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what? This car will make you even good looking.

285
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm already good looking, pal.

286
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:34,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How's it going?

287
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When's our first race?

288
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uhh, pretty soon.

289
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:45,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You gonna be ready?

290
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hope so.

291
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:50,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Huh... I hope so.

292
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:54,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, no false modesty. I got a lot of money on this.

293
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did Shannon ever tell you how we met?

294
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:03,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I used to produce movies.

295
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In the 80's.

296
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:08,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kinda like action films and sexy stuff.

297
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One critic called them 'European'.

298
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought they were shit.

299
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:15,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anyway he arranged all the cars for me. Did all the stunts.

300
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:18,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I liked him. I like having him around.

301
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:20,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Even though, he'd overcharge the shit out of me.

302
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His next business venture.

303
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He got involved with some of Nino's friends.

304
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They didn't go for the overcharging bit.

305
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They broke his pelvis.

306
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's never had a lot of luck.

307
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:37,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The reason I'm telling you this is,

308
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's got a lot invested in you.

309
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:40,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So do I.

310
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:44,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, you need anything, you call me.

311
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,200

522
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:16,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}'Cause I can keep it safe for you.

523
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:17,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Would you just stop?

524
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:27,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This guy Cook, he have a real name?

525
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:30,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chris.

526
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe.

527
01:03:34,970 --> 01:03:38,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll ask Bernie, see if he knows him.

528
01:03:39,810 --> 01:03:42,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jesus! I can't stop thinking about...

529
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:44,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}what we could do with all that dough.

530
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:46,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Would you stop? - Alright!

531
01:03:46,350 --> 01:03:48,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, a lot of guys messing around with married women.

532
01:03:48,730 --> 01:03:50,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but you're the only one

533
01:03:50,180 --> 01:03:52,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know who robs a joint, to pay back the husband.

534
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:55,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Crazy!

536
01:03:57,070 --> 01:03:58,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll take care of it.

538
01:04:31,020 --> 01:04:32,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's in the dressing room.

539
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:35,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's that?

540
01:04:36,070 --> 01:04:38,110

01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:09,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whose money do I have?

542
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry... they're gonna come and get it.

543
01:05:15,570 --> 01:05:16,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Call them.

544
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:18,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Somebody call Nino.

545
01:05:30,210 --> 01:05:32,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you remember this?

546
01:05:58,030 --> 01:05:59,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hello. - Nino?

547

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, sorry pal. Why don't you call back later, we're closed.

548
01:06:03,130 --> 01:06:03,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I could,

01:06:03,890 --> 01:06:06,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I think Nino would be upset that you made him wait.

550
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:08,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I ask what this is about?

551
01:06:10,250 --> 01:06:11,620

01:06:12,710 --> 01:06:13,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that would be?

553
01:06:14,930 --> 01:06:16,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A million dollars.

554
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:19,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please hold.

555

558
01:06:41,490 --> 01:06:43,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}why?

559
01:06:44,740 --> 01:06:47,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're expecting to buy my own shit back from you?

560
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:48,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not selling it.

561
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:50,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna give you a time and place,

563
01:06:52,370 --> 01:06:54,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you understand?

564
01:06:56,460 --> 01:06:58,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you getting out of it?

565
01:06:59,630 --> 01:07:00,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just that.

566
01:07:02,010 --> 01:07:03,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}'Out of it.'

567
01:07:04,430 --> 01:07:06,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And your partners are happy with that?

568
01:07:08,470 --> 01:07:09,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't have any partners.

569
01:07:11,430 --> 01:07:15,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You discuss this with anybody else?

570
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:17,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, just with you.

571
01:07:19,230 --> 01:07:21,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not very good at this. Are you?

572
01:07:33,210 --> 01:07:35,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go check it out who the fucking guy is?

573
01:08:14,830 --> 01:08:16,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I talk to you for a minute?

574
01:08:18,210 --> 01:08:19,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't talk, I have to go.

575
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:24,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I just walk with you for?

576
01:08:46,650 --> 01:08:47,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have to tell you something.

577
01:08:54,450 --> 01:08:56,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Standard was into some...

578
01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:01,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}guys in prison for a lot of money.

579
01:09:03,630 --> 01:09:06,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And it would ruin you and Benicio if he wouldn't pay it.

580
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:12,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He asked me for my help.

581
01:09:15,470 --> 01:09:18,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everything went wrong, eh.

582
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:22,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.

583
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:29,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I still got the money.

584
01:09:33,870 --> 01:09:35,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can have it, if you want to.

585
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:40,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can take Benicio...

586
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:53,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just thought, we could get out of here.

587
01:09:53,900 --> 01:09:55,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you wanted.

588
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:00,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I could come with you.

589
01:10:04,570 --> 01:10:06,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I could look out for you.

590
01:10:11,490 --> 01:10:14,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry...uh... Wrong floor.

591
01:13:38,030 --> 01:13:40,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He came into my apartment, Shannon.

592
01:13:41,740 --> 01:13:43,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How did they know where I live?

593
01:13:45,580 --> 01:13:47,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told you, I was gonna call Bernie.

594
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:49,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just wanted him know that...

595
01:13:49,210 --> 01:13:49,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that it wasn't about that,

596
01:13:49,830 --> 01:13:51,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you are not interested in the money.

597
01:13:51,380 --> 01:13:53,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and that you just did it for the girl.

598
01:13:55,470 --> 01:13:56,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did you say?

599
01:13:56,650 --> 01:13:57,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no.

600
01:13:59,260 --> 01:14:01,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the fucking are you told them about Irene?

601
01:14:01,420 --> 01:14:02,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Calm down.

602
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:03,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You told him about Irene!!!

603
01:14:03,890 --> 01:14:04,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Calm down. Calm down.

604
01:14:04,930 --> 01:14:05,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just calm down a little.

605
01:14:07,060 --> 01:14:07,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll kill you.

606
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:09,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You told them about Irene?

607
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:11,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, I just, I just wanted him to know...

608
01:14:12,650 --> 01:14:14,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that as soon as you return the money,

609
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:15,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that was the end of it. That's all.

610
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:17,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't know, how was I supposed to know?

611
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:19,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How was I supposed to know that?!

612
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:20,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay?

613
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:23,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, let me just talk to Bernie... okay?

614
01:14:24,070 --> 01:14:26,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why you got to fuck everything up, Shannon?

615
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:27,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How was I supposed to know?

616
01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:29,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everything is related to Nino!

617
01:14:36,170 --> 01:14:37,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're gonna come looking for me.

618

620
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:43,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You gotta get out of here.

621

623
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:53,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You get out of here and you never fucking come back.

624
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:56,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You never come back.

625
01:15:02,110 --> 01:15:04,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you gonna do?

626
01:15:21,090 --> 01:15:23,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I already gave you my advice.

627
01:15:23,930 --> 01:15:26,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should've taken the money, and left the guy alone.

628
01:15:27,010 --> 01:15:28,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just not that simple Bernie.

629
01:15:28,180 --> 01:15:29,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! Of course not!

630
01:15:29,190 --> 01:15:31,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now everything's bounced up in your face!

631
01:15:31,230 --> 01:15:32,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, I owe you this guy.

632
01:15:32,420 --> 01:15:34,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just give me a little time and I'll get rid of him.

633
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:36,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shut the fuck up.

634
01:15:36,770 --> 01:15:38,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You fucking monkey!

635
01:15:39,230 --> 01:15:42,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The money, belongs to some half-assed wise guy,

636
01:15:42,410 --> 01:15:42,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}out of Philly.

637
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:44,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now I got tipped off...

638
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:47,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he was stashing a million bucks in a pawn shop.

639
01:15:47,290 --> 01:15:49,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's gonna invest it here in L.A.

640
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:51,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was gonna set up a rival operation.

641
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:53,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, you stole from the east-coast mob?

642
01:15:53,830 --> 01:15:56,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now! I stole from some jump up punk,

643
01:15:56,830 --> 01:15:58,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}who's trying to step on our action.

644
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:01,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah... then why didn't you come to me,

645
01:16:01,170 --> 01:16:03,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}before you set up this dummy robbery?

646
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:06,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Before you hire this piece of shit.

647
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This was something off to the side,

648
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:09,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bernie. I didn't wanna involve you on this.

649
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:11,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I'm involved now!

650
01:16:13,850 --> 01:16:15,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me tell you something.

651
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:21,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anybody! Anybody finds out you stole from the family,

652
01:16:21,620 --> 01:16:22,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we are both dead.

653
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:24,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What fucking family?

654
01:16:25,950 --> 01:16:29,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The family who still calls me a fucking kike?

655
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:31,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To my face!

656
01:16:32,580 --> 01:16:34,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, I'm fifty nine years old Bernie,

657
01:16:34,910 --> 01:16:37,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they still pinched my cheek like I'm some fucking kid.

658
01:16:39,250 --> 01:16:40,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Family.

659
01:16:40,630 --> 01:16:43,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The money always flows up, easy.

660
01:16:43,380 --> 01:16:45,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know that.

661
01:16:46,430 --> 01:16:48,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's why this driver's gotta go, Bernie.

662
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:51,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's gotta go.

663
01:16:51,470 --> 01:16:53,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and your pal, Shannon.

664
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:57,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's these two guys, that can tie me to this rob.

665
01:17:36,850 --> 01:17:39,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, it's your turn to clean up after me.

666
01:18:43,130 --> 01:18:44,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All this priceless cars

667
01:18:45,210 --> 01:18:47,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}one would think you'd have better locks.

668
01:18:49,630 --> 01:18:53,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alright... doors is always open to you.

669
01:18:53,590 --> 01:18:55,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Going somewhere?

670
01:19:00,210 --> 01:19:02,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was thinking about it.

671
01:19:03,230 --> 01:19:05,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm looking for your driver.

672
01:19:07,650 --> 01:19:10,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are breaking in here, I figure it's bad news.

673
01:19:10,150 --> 01:19:11,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, Shannon.

674
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:13,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's bad luck.

675
01:19:14,410 --> 01:19:18,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two thousand heists a year in this city.

676
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:19,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He has to pick the wrong one.

677
01:19:20,580 --> 01:19:22,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He tried to put it right.

678
01:19:22,290 --> 01:19:24,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, he picked the wrong guy for that too.

679
01:19:24,580 --> 01:19:26,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My partner is a belligerent asshole,

680
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:28,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with his back against the wall.

681
01:19:29,510 --> 01:19:31,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right now, so am I.

682
01:19:32,380 --> 01:19:34,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I don't set this straight, I'm in big trouble.

683
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:40,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Any idea where he might be?

684
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:44,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mexico.

685
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:48,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or maybe it was Balize.

686
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:52,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really?

687
01:19:59,450 --> 01:20:02,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was excited about this whole thing.

688
01:20:02,870 --> 01:20:05,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My name on a car!

689
01:20:05,370 --> 01:20:07,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, look how beautiful.

690
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:10,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wanted to see my name on this thing.

691
01:20:13,130 --> 01:20:15,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think we would've made a go with this business.

692
01:20:31,230 --> 01:20:32,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry.

693
01:20:32,110 --> 01:20:33,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry.

694
01:20:33,190 --> 01:20:34,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's it.

695
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:38,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's done. There is no pain, it's over. It's over.

696
01:25:16,050 --> 01:25:17,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the fuck was that?

697
01:27:55,730 --> 01:27:57,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello.

698
01:27:58,260 --> 01:28:01,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know the story about this scorpion and a frog

699
01:27:58,260 --> 01:28:03,200


700
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:07,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You friend Nino didn't make it, cross the river.

701
01:28:09,730 --> 01:28:12,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think this thing has gone on long enough.

702
01:28:14,070 --> 01:28:16,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see any reason for this to continue?

703
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:20,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you say we meet?

704
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:23,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why?

705

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You, me and your girlfriend are the only players left.

707
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:34,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How's that for a reason?

708
01:28:35,930 --> 01:28:37,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When?

709

01:28:39,470 --> 01:28:41,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a place on Sherman Way

711

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}there's a restaurant called The Great Wall.

712
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:45,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you know it?

713
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:14,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I talk to you?

714
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:19,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I won't keep you long.

715
01:29:24,350 --> 01:29:26,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have to go somewhere now.

716
01:29:26,270 --> 01:29:28,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think I can come back.

717

720
01:30:34,380 --> 01:30:35,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you bring the money?

721

724
01:30:53,810 --> 01:30:55,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't offer you the same.

725
