1
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,060
Pick up. Come on,pick up.

2
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,490
Hey,it's me.

3
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:11,690
We need to talk.

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:13,230
I can explain everything.

5
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,380
Call me.

6
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:01,090
No!

10
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,800
Then there's your medical history...

11
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,650
the LI-90 for life
insurance, the DA-93...

12
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:46,400
You're lucky this is just a
temp Joint Duty assignment.

13
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,140
Just a few forms left.

14
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:50,140
Like the Notification
of Personnel Action,

15
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,830
the TA-44 and the background questionnaire
for your new security clearance.

16
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,480
- Roda.
- Bishop's gonna be useless for the next week.

17
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,480
Should we rescue her?

18
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,820
No.

19
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,170
If she can't handle Roda,
Gibbs is gonna melt her brain.

20
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:08,380
Oh! And I'm gonna
need...the DD-817 ASAP.

21
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:11,460
Oh,this is actually version 6045.

22
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,710
The DoD is up to v49 on the DD-817.

23
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,670
Black pen only,no smudges.

24
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:20,850
And don't test me...

25
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,390
kitty-cat.

26
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,860
I can see you, gentlemen.

27
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,700
What just happened?

28
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,150
Did I do something wrong?

29
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,290
No,you just passed your first test.

30
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:37,690
Roda,from
HR--legendary.

31
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:38,910
But don't get too cocky.

32
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,490
Still got to take that polygraph.

33
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,360
<i>I have to take another polygraph?</i>

34
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,410
And then all you have to do is survive
Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

35
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:48,920
- In case you haven't heard,the man is...
- He's actually coming up behind you right now.

36
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,720
You're not supposed to do that.

37
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,760
What did I do now?

38
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,090
You've made a friend.

39
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:00,930
Grab your gear.Got a dead
Marine in Potomac Heights.

40
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,020
You waiting on something,Bishop?

41
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,270
I don't have any gear.

42
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,270
Good. You can drive.

43
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,520
Okay.

44
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,390
Corporal Ron Flegman,

45
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:17,910
23,stationed out of
Quantico,worked in the motor pool.

46
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,530
He live here alone?

47
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:23,230
Upstairs.Already spoke with his CO.

48
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,290
Solid Marine, stellar evaluations.

49
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,290
Not much else.

50
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,760
Well,if this was a mugging,it
was a really bad one.

51
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,960
We got a witness.

52
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:36,710
He saw someone enter the back of the
building just prior to the shooting.

53
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,420
We even got a sketch,
courtesy of Magic Fingers here.

54
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,880
Here you go.

55
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,600
That's a clown.

56
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,020
Well,uh,a street performer,yes.

57
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,940
See,there weren't very many details,

58
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,440
<i>so I used Jumpy,from Jumpy's
Funhouse,as a template.</i>

59
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:55,530
Jumpy had this really big,like,this,like,red
nose, and when he smiled,

60
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:59,740
he... It was this kids show I
used to watch,when I was little.

61
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,990
Um,we were told there were several
street performers who work the area.

62
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:07,160
With any luck,maybe Jumpy
the Clown had a permit.

63
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,610
Check the licensing office.

64
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,280
Pull every permit on the block.

65
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,050
Nice.

66
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,250
Oh,thank heavens we're indoors.

67
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,120
It's been a brutal week.

68
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,170
And I have a chill I just can't shake.

69
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:22,430
Me too. Anybody mind if
I do some jumping jacks?

70
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,480
- Yes.
- Yes.

71
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,820
Well,preliminary cause of death appears
to be two gunshot wounds to the chest.

72
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,690
Yeah. From medium range.

73
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:32,690
Ah,Ms. Bishop.

74
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:35,940
Would you care to take a
closer look at the wound?

75
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,810
sure.

76
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,080
Yeah.

77
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,110
Note this one.

78
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,480
It's oval in shape,

79
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,280
which means that the bullet
penetrated the skin at an angle.

80
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,820
Huh. Can you get a trajectory from that?

81
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,160
Well,possible trajectory,yeah.

82
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,340
Very astute.

83
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:58,710
Also,we get a core temperature,we
can approximate time of death.

84
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,760
Boss,he's got a second cell phone.

85
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:01,850
Anything on it?

86
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,330
Well,it's password-locked,

87
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:07,800
but looks like he received almost a dozen
missed calls just prior to the shooting.

88
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,890
Maybe somebody was trying to warn him.

89
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:11,470
I know that number.

90
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,840
Adams House hotel.

91
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,840
Doesn't your dad always stay there?

92
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,030
Yes,but...

93
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,200
no,no,no.

94
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,370
He's at a skin peel retreat,300
miles away, so there's no way.

95
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,820
You know,checkout's in half an hour.

96
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,400
Whoever called our victim
might still be there.

97
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:25,790
McGee,you got the crime scene.

98
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,910
DiNozzo,with me.

99
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,530
that... that was...

100
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:33,860
that was fast.

101
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,080
- Fast.
- Yeah.

102
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,590
Manager said the calls
came from room 103.

103
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:44,040
Registered to Mr. Smith.

104
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,010
I'm gonna go with
"alias"" what do you think?

105
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:48,210
Manager coming to open it up?

106
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:50,850
No.She gave me the key.

107
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:56,270
Since it's two minutes after
checkout,technically,we have a right to enter.

108
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,410
That's funny, that
looks like your ex-wife.

109
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,700
Champagne first,and then...

110
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,070
a little...

111
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:20,090
Well,tie me up and call me Loretta.

112
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,370
Wowzers.

113
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,570
This is not what it looks like.

114
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,620
Right. We were just...

115
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:42,360
No,I do not need the details.

116
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,550
I wouldn't mind a few details.

117
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:46,380
- Okay,look...
- Zip it,windbag. Not another word.

118
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,370
What are you talking about?
The cat is out of the bag.

119
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,390
It just sort of happened,okay?

120
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:55,210
We were gonna tell you. We just
kept it hush-hush because...

121
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:56,240
She's married.

122
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,430
Because we're concerned that
Emily won't take it well.

123
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,480
She's 13,this can be...

124
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:05,480
confusing. And Victor and I are
separated,we're getting a divorce.

125
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:08,940
Your turn. What the hell
are you doing in our room?

126
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,190
Well,we got a dead Marine.

127
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:15,300
His cell phone got a call from
this room just prior to his murder.

128
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,960
That's impossible.

129
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,360
We've been in this room since last
night,and I haven't used the phone.

130
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,570
Oh,but I'm getting a feeling she has.

131
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,740
Diane...?

132
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,410
Could I speak with you?

133
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,790
Privately?

134
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,740
- If you'd like to be shot.
- Okay,fine.I used the phone.

135
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,750
But not to call some Marine.

136
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,930
I was trying to call my boyfriend Eddie.

137
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,300
Oh,that's funny. It sounded
like you said boyfriend.

138
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,770
Well,ex-boyfriend,now. I
was calling to break it off.

139
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:44,060
While I was in the bathtub?

140
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,750
You had a boyfriend while
I was in the bathtub?

141
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,230
But he never picked up.

142
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,390
So,you don't know Private Ron Flegman?

143
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,530
It's probably her fianc茅e.
This is unbelievable.

144
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,360
No,I've never heard
that name in my life.

145
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:56,200
No,you know what?You need to calm down.

146
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,870
You just said it yourself;
this just sort of happened.

147
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,040
So,yes,fine, you caught me.

148
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,790
I was dating someone else.

149
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:06,080
But,you know,it was a
little,innocent overlap.

150
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:11,450
Any idea why our victim would
have your boyfriend's cell phone?

151
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,780
Ex-boyfriend,and no.

152
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,640
But,you know,I gotta say,

153
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,010
I'm not that surprised that Eddie is
mixed up with some dead guy, because,um,

154
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:21,060
I mean,huh,he was,he was fun.

155
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,480
- I don't need the details.
- But the,yeah,there was,something wasn't right.

156
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,350
I kept catching him in these lies and...

157
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,900
he has no credit history.

158
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,610
- Everybody has a credit history.
- Well,that's enough for me.

159
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,440
Let's go arrest him.

160
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,440
Oh,no. We're gonna talk to him first.

161
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,440
I knew you were gonna say that.

162
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,770
Crime scene's locked up.

163
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,740
Thought I'd come by and se...

164
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,310
Hi,Chucky.

165
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:41,660
What?

166
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,820
So,Agent Fornell was
married to Gibbs's ex-wife?

167
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,990
Yup.

168
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:52,660
And the owner of the second cell phone from
our crime scene was dating Gibbs's ex-wife?

169
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,430
Yup.

170
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:56,430
That's quite a coincidence.

171
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,350
I know. It really is.

172
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:02,350
You know, it's hard to imagine the same
woman liking Fornell and this Eddie guy.

173
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:06,350
Although,maybe Diane liked
him because he's not Fornell.

174
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,140
Best leave the psychoanalysis to Ducky.

175
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,560
If you value breathing.

176
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,280
Bishop,you could have warned me.

177
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,480
You said I wasn't supposed to do that.

178
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:21,070
Tobias.

179
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,490
What are you doing here?

180
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:23,960
Just thought you might need some help.

181
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,870
Diane's really worried, I just
want to put her mind at ease.

182
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,360
Yeah,uh-huh.

183
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,660
You shot me in the caboose.You owe me.

184
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,160
McGee.Go.

185
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,090
Okay.

186
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,390
Uh,meet Eddie Macklin.

187
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,390
Diane Sterling's... boyfriend.

188
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,390
Ex-boyfriend.

189
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:47,710
He's 31 years old and works
at a local climbing gym.

190
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:51,180
Yeah,and...?

191
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:54,650
And that's it, we couldn't find
anything prior to six months ago.

192
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,690
No parking ticket,
library card or bus pass.

193
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:57,720
Interesting.

194
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,070
Let's go ask him about it.

195
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:04,750
God...

196
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,200
Yeah,I knew him.

197
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,340
He came in about six months
ago, looking for a job.

198
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,040
He teaches our Basic Climb class.

199
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,060
His chest is bigger than Diane's.

200
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,750
You know where he is?

201
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:20,040
No. And he actually blew off
a private lesson this morning.

202
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:22,630
But I don't think Eddie was
a big fan of the student.

203
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:25,130
How about this guy?You know him?

204
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,890
Yeah,that's him.

205
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,300
That's Eddie's student.

206
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,560
Geez,what happened?

207
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,760
Corporal Flegman was shot.

208
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,360
We found Eddie's cell phone on him.

209
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,060
We'd like to talk to him
about it.Among other things.

210
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,780
I knew Eddie was trouble.

211
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,030
Just something off about him.

212
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,820
You know where we can find him?

213
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,570
I don't know--
his apartment?

214
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:45,740
Uh,it's empty.

215
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,960
No car registration with the DMV.

216
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,540
That's weird. He has a car.

217
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,580
I got the info on his
employment application.

218
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,080
- Let me get it.
- Thanks.

219
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:59,220
Yeah,suspect's vehicle is an '88
silver Lincoln Town Car.it's a DC plate.

220
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,720
Have Bishop run the BOLO.

221
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,790
- You sure?
- Yeah.

222
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:02,950
On it.

223
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,560
Grab a bite?

224
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,620
I'm good.

225
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,860
Beer?

226
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,960
Long day,Tobias.

227
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,180
What the hell am I doing,Gibbs?

228
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:22,770
I feel like I've been swallowed by a python,cut
my way out and then crawled back inside again.

229
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:25,530
- Sounds about right.
- Oh,come on.

230
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:26,930
Are we making a mistake?

231
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:29,760
- **
- ***

232
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,480
What are you looking for?

233
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,080
Not just sex,if that's
what you're getting at.

234
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:34,670
- Stop.
- But don't get me wrong,no,

235
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,790
- it's better than...
- Just stop.

236
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,820
I'm just saying that there's
something different this time.

237
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,840
Maybe because we're exes.

238
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,710
You should try it. I mean...

239
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,600
with another one of your ex-wives,

240
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,180
not this one,'cause this one's... taken.

241
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,350
Can I go home now?

242
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,850
You are the worse advice
giver I've ever met!

243
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,840
Don't quit your day job.

244
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:59,160
I think...

245
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,910
as long as you're happy,
that's all that matters.

246
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,730
Happy?

247
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:05,850
What's that got to do with anything?

248
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,120
It's my neighbor.

249
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,860
She watches Emily.

250
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,410
What'd she do now?

251
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,190
No,I'll go.

252
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,210
She didn't come home for dinner again.

253
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,630
Third time this week.

254
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:23,380
I've got to go prowl
the mall looking for her.

255
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,040
Rain check?

256
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,370
I can wait.

257
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:50,580
No way in hell am I living with either
of them,if they're back together.

258
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:07,650
Can I stay one more night
at your house,Uncle Gibbs?

259
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,770
<i>We can watch African Queen again.</i>

260
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:11,540
Your parents want you back.

261
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,380
They didn't want me back last night.

262
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:16,430
I'm 13-- they'd let me emigrate
to Jupiter if I could get a ride.

263
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:21,330
Morning. I entered Eddie Macklin's
vehicle information into the NCIC database,

264
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,640
along with a physical description.

265
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,550
Then I sent out copies to
all law enforcement agencies.

266
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,440
- And then I-I just
felt like... - Bishop.

267
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,220
You can just say "BOLO's out."

268
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,840
BOLO's out.

269
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:34,730
He actually told me you're doing great,

270
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,700
but you need to relax a little.

271
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,520
Can't say I disagree.

272
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:41,650
- Emily.
- Thank you.

273
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:44,870
Do you have any idea what kind
of trouble you are in,missy?

274
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,020
Me?!

275
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,240
You're the one who's ruining your life.

276
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,130
I beg your pardon?

277
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:52,800
Uh,www.you-and-dad-suck-
together.com?

278
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,920
Or are you too desperate
at this point to care?

279
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,370
Apple doesn't fall
far from the tree,huh?

280
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,710
How dare you talk to me like that.

281
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:02,390
You and Dad speak to each
other?All you guys do is fight.

282
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:04,210
We do not fight.

283
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,980
We are just very loud!

284
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,110
Best let them wear each other
out before I get into it.

285
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:11,050
Right. And you!How
could you do this to me?

286
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,990
Honey,no one is doing anything to you.

287
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,360
Your mother and I are just...

288
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,620
Wait a second.

289
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,830
How exactly do you know about...

290
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,080
your mother and me?

291
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,410
I know everything.

292
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:25,160
I put a keystroke logger on
both your Facebook accounts.

293
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:27,900
- You what?!
- You need a warrant to do that!

294
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,700
Gibbs,Gibbs,Gibbs,Gibbs,Gibbs,Gibbs.

295
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:32,540
I cracked the suspect's cell phone.

296
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:38,240
There are boatloads of juicy texts on
there from him to Fornell's ex-wife.

297
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,350
<i>I mean,this stuff is-is kinkier
than Fifty Shades of Grey.</i>

298
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:43,720
You have got to come see this...

299
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,590
Fornell.

300
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:49,970
Ex-wife.

301
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,590
Daughter.

302
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,900
You get back here or I will smash

303
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:01,280
every computer in that lab!
Don't you touch my babies!

304
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:06,410
Can I apply for asylum?

305
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,780
Abbs,I hope you told Gibbs to come alone

306
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,380
'cause Fornell's head would
explode if he saw these texts.

307
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,620
- Better get a mop.
- Tony! If you value your life,

308
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,950
you will turn off that
computer right now!

309
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,640
Touch that CPU and I touch you.

310
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:24,310
I can't hear you.I have a sinus
infection.I have to go get my neti pot.

311
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:27,130
No,no. Oh...

312
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,010
Hey,what happened?

313
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:32,770
I'm prepared for any contingency.

314
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,520
You are interfering in
an ongoing investigation.

315
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,430
Turn that computer back on.

316
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,610
Okay,Tobias,I sent most of those texts
before you and I were back together again,

317
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,610
so... they're inadmissible.

318
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:46,360
Okay. Just show me the texts that Mata
Hari here sent after we got our game on.

319
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,150
Let's see how innocent that
innocent overlap really was.

320
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:51,280
- Everybody still alive?
- Yes,just wounded.

321
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:53,650
- By betrayal.
- Where's Emily?

322
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,500
Conference room with
Bishop. And she's fine.

323
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:57,670
You got anything besides Diane's texts?

324
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,820
Yeah.

325
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:01,540
The suspect,um,sent a
few texts of his own.

326
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:04,160
He mentioned a safety
deposit box at a local bank.

327
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,100
- Who'd he send them to?
- A burn phone with a black market number.

328
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,300
So something is definitely afoot here.

329
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,840
You got the name of the bank?

330
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,170
Let's go check it out.

331
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,140
Slow down.

332
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:17,860
I want Diane to come along so she can I.D.
her ex-boyfriend from the security tapes.

333
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,840
So?

334
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,810
So I'm not bringing both of you.

335
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:29,820
The locksmith is almost finished
with the safe deposit box.

336
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,290
Let me go check on the security footage.

337
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:34,040
Would you like something to drink?

338
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,190
No,I'm good.

339
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,550
I'll take a water. One straw,two
pieces of ice, three slices of lemon.

340
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,050
Jethro,what the hell am I doing?

341
00:16:56,050 --> 00:17:01,070
I feel like I drove into a ditch,towed my
car out and then drove right back in again.

342
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:03,490
Oh,God,please don't make me do this.

343
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,160
This is all your fault.

344
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:09,560
What? If you hadn't shot Tobias in the ass,I
wouldn't have had to nurse him back to health.

345
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,920
He was so vulnerable.

346
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,030
You know,his pride was so wounded and...

347
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,710
Then one night I was
helping him with his bath...

348
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,100
Stop. Stop.

349
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,400
What is wrong with you two?

350
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:26,550
I just need to know if you
think we're making a mistake.

351
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:29,920
It depends. Uh...

352
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:33,800
What are you... looking for?

353
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,310
I just want to...

354
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,760
wake up next to someone I love.

355
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:44,030
Here's Mr. Macklin's safe deposit
box and the security footage.

356
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,100
Thank you.

357
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,710
He rented the box a month ago.

358
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:57,160
There's been a lot of
activity since then.

359
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,180
Define "a lot."

360
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:01,290
He's been here over ten times
in the last three weeks alone.

361
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:06,250
Well,who stores stationery
in a safe deposit box?

362
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,450
Perhaps he removed the important
contents on his last visit.

363
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:12,090
Let's see his last visit.

364
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:24,470
Oh,that's Eddie right there He
doesn't appear to be carrying anything.

365
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,350
Who the hell is she?

366
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,270
Looks like a girlfriend.

367
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,490
Girlfriend?

368
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,580
While we were dating?

369
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,480
That two-timing

370
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,980
- son of a...
- Hey. Diane.

371
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:36,370
While you were dating
Eddie,you and Fornell were...

372
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:39,320
Oh... forget it.

373
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,650
Did she have to sign in,too?

374
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:41,720
No,just the box's owner.

375
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,520
Well,we're gonna have to find her.

376
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,090
We will. Relax.

377
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,090
She's our only lead to Eddie.

378
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:53,180
The bullet fragment bounced around the
acetabulum, flew up to the iliac crest...

379
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:56,220
Before exiting just below the coccyx.
I'm telling you,Doctor,it's amazing.

380
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,800
Let me guess. The JFK
Magic Bullet Theory?

381
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:01,670
Oh,ac-actually it's...
Agent Fornell's heinie.

382
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,610
Uh,I'm sorry. Uh...

383
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,310
to what do we owe the pleasure?

384
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:10,020
Ooh. Uh,pleasure,no. But,uh,

385
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,020
I do need to better
familiarize myself with...

386
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:15,200
actual dead people.

387
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:17,370
Who are dead.

388
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:19,290
I thought you might be able to help me.

389
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:21,330
You've come to the right place.

390
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:24,910
Say hello again to Corporal Ron Flegman.

391
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,870
Hello.

392
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:38,010
We confirmed that the gunshots
were the cause of death,

393
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,310
but that is really just the start.

394
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,850
For example, the,uh...

395
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:47,220
Postmortem lividity on the body indicates
that the victim wasn't moved after the murder.

396
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,270
That-that is... that is correct.

397
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:53,360
Uh,however,the bruise on
the front of his calf there,

398
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,610
it indicates that...

399
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,860
He was diabetic.

400
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,610
Necrobiosis lipoidica,
I think it's called.

401
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,330
That's also correct.

402
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:06,790
<i>I took the liberty of reading the
Handbook of Autopsy Practice this weekend.</i>

403
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,670
The whole thing?

404
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,430
It's-it's over 600 pages.

405
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:13,930
It was 596,actually.It was really cool.

406
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:19,100
Happy first official
joint duty BOLO to you.

407
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,300
It's a very special moment.

408
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,850
Blow out the candle. Make a wish.

409
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,390
My BOLO on Eddie Macklin came in?

410
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,610
Your wish came true.

411
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:29,540
Ah. Airport police found his car
in a long-term parking facility.

412
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,930
Rock on. Let's go get it.

413
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:34,570
Mm. We are.You aren't.

414
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:37,600
You have a little appointment
with the polygraph person.

415
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,120
Already?

416
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,940
Don't worry. It's gonna
be fun.Polygraphs...

417
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,710
Who doesn't love
talking about themselves?

418
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:51,630
I was dropping Emily off at school.

419
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,120
I heard you found
Diane's ex-boy-toy's car.

420
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,590
Yeah,he left it in long-term
parking at the airport.

421
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,230
What a pile of junk.

422
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:02,390
Hath the woman no shame?

423
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,230
Can you believe he's half her age?

424
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:06,970
I guess you weren't
stallion enough,Chuckie.

425
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,900
Agent Fornell, I swear,we never...

426
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,140
Yeah. Diane told me the same
thing,and I believed her,

427
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:15,610
though current circumstances are throwing
a bit of cold water on her credibility.

428
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,240
You run down the flights
out of the airport?

429
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,660
Yes. There's no Eddie Macklin listed.

430
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:22,150
So why was he parked there?

431
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:24,080
That's not the half of it.

432
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:30,120
Not only did we find a clown nose in
the trunk but we also found blood on...

433
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,490
Abby. We're supposed to
wait for Gibbs to get back.

434
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,210
Oh,right. Never mind.

435
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,590
You found blood in the car?

436
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,160
Minute traces of it everywhere.

437
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:40,170
We think someone tried to clean it up.

438
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:44,600
But I was still able to detect blood
proteins from at least four separate victims.

439
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:49,470
What... You're saying that Diane's
ex was some kind of serial killer?

440
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,810
That's...

441
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:10,790
We interviewed all the street performers licensed
in the area where Corporal Flegman was killed.

442
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:13,830
- They all had alibis.
- And very large shoes.

443
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:17,400
At the moment, that leaves
one remaining suspect.

444
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:22,710
Diane Sterling's ex-lover,and owner of a
Lincoln with multiple blood stains in it.

445
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:28,230
What,Diane?

446
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,890
Well,have you found him yet?

447
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,610
No,we have not found him yet.

448
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:33,950
It's the same answer as the
last four times when you called.

449
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:40,400
We found circumstantial evidence in
this car linking him to Flegman's murder,

450
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:43,660
but no indication  of
his current whereabouts.

451
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,830
What,Tobias? Aren't you with Diane?

452
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,030
Are you holding anything back?

453
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:50,700
No,I am not holding anything back.

454
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,700
I will tell you when I have something.

455
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,170
Fine.

456
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:56,500
Oh,I can't believe I was so
worried about that polygraph.

457
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:58,210
I mean,at NSA, they ask you everything.

458
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,430
As in,like,everything.

459
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:05,900
I'm surprised you guys don't
have,like,more personnel issues with how...

460
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:11,800
I am interrupting something.**

461
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,030
No. I want you to work.

462
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,330
That means we tell him what we know.

463
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:29,120
Oh. So far,no luck using facial
recognition to track our mystery woman.

464
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,590
I'm still working on it.

465
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:34,380
And Abby hasn't gotten any hits on the
blood samples we found in Eddie's car.

466
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,910
Total is five individuals.

467
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:38,850
All right,expand the
BOLO.I want this guy's photo

468
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:41,850
in every train station,
in every bus station.

469
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:43,420
That's a bad idea.

470
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,810
I mean... I might have a better idea.

471
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:51,610
Look,Eddie is coming back.

472
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:56,030
If he was ditching his car, there are easier
places to abandon it than at an airport.

473
00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:00,150
We should put it back and watch
it,and when he comes to pick it up...

474
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:01,600
We grab him.

475
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,210
Absolutely not.

476
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:09,740
We follow him, see what he
does,where he goes, then we grab him.

477
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,950
Works for me.

478
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,300
I got the first shift.

479
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,300
Don't tell anybody where I am.

480
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:01,160
Why do you always go for the gun?

481
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,760
What are you doing here?

482
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:05,670
Well,don't worry, I'm not gonna stay.

483
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,020
I know. It wasn't the question.

484
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:11,520
Tobias and I had a family
dinner planned with Emily,

485
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,520
and she left us a message,
saying she had other plans,

486
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:15,390
so I thought maybe she'd come back here.

487
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:18,110
Try the mall.

488
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:22,680
Yes,that's where I'm going right
now,thank you.I will let you know.

489
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:25,790
I hope you and your
gun have fun together.

490
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,720
Can't believe she missed me.

491
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,840
Who doesn't check the closet
when they're clearing a house?

492
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,090
Who doesn't turn off their cell
phone when they're hiding in a closet?

493
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,480
Wasn't my cell phone.

494
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:55,900
<i>I forgot I set my Happy Cat Friend Alert Watch to
let me know when the Columbo marathonstarted tonight.</i>

495
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,350
Have to tell your mom. She's worried.

496
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:02,360
I know. I know. Just give me
two minutes.I need your help.

497
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,870
All right,what do you need?

498
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:16,870
I want you to help me convince
my parents to break up.

499
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:19,170
They listen to you.

500
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,040
And you know they aren't
right for each other.

501
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,460
You've seen them fight.

502
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,040
They fighting a lot?

503
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:25,680
In public,yeah.

504
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,970
It's like they have a fetish for it.

505
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:33,800
But... when it's just the three
of us,it's not so bad,I guess.

506
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:36,260
But you know this will end badly.

507
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:39,440
Well,yeah,it might.

508
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:43,150
Then I get to watch them
break up all over again.

509
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:44,770
Oh,I... I'm confused.

510
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,870
You-you-you don't
want them together?

511
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:50,490
Or you're scared that
they're gonna break up again?

512
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:53,460
Why would I be scared
of that?It's what I want!

513
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,290
Uh... Wait.

514
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:56,580
<i>Now I'm confused.</i>

515
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,910
You suck at this!

516
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,120
Yeah,it's Gibbs.

517
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,590
Bishop and I are at the airport.

518
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:08,070
Eddie's back. He picked up his car.

519
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,390
We're tailing him now.

520
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:11,390
Yeah,stay with it. Let me know.

521
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:12,590
Will do.

522
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,980
Two minutes are
up,kid.Let's get you home.

523
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,900
Give me a sit-rep.

524
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,350
Eddie drove all night.

525
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,820
I think he was trying
to see if he had a tail.

526
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:27,990
He finally came here, parked
his car and disappeared.

527
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:29,490
Fornell's covering the rear.

528
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:34,030
Okay. DiNozzo,you're with
me.McGee,Bishop, you got the exit.

529
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:47,510
We're clear.

530
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:51,180
Looks like Hannibal
Lecter's little hobby center.

531
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,840
Boss.

532
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,390
I got this.

533
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,700
NCIS.

534
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:12,540
Get on the ground, put
your hands on your head!

535
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:19,960
Where do you think you're going?

536
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,550
Oh,come on.

537
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,010
Senior FBI Agent Tobias Fornell.

538
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:38,930
I believe you know my wife.

539
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:44,400
Is he gonna hit me again?

540
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:48,240
No. And...

541
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,530
And I apologize for that.We just
really needed to talk to you.

542
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:54,900
Yeah,about what?

543
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:03,700
Aren't you gonna ask what happened?

544
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,570
Flegman was a student of yours.

545
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:07,540
What happened?

546
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,880
You slept with my wife!

547
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,580
What happened... was that...

548
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:18,350
your student was murdered...
with your cell phone on him.

549
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,640
And then you disappeared.

550
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:23,060
Why is your car covered with blood?

551
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:25,440
And what's with that little
shop of horrors we found you in?

552
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,980
Oh,that storage unit--
that ain't mine,bro.

553
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,700
Oh,I suppose this isn't yours,either.

554
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,230
We found 20 more of those
hidden in the storage unit.

555
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:33,030
That's almost 100 grand.

556
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,740
It's a lot of cash for a gym teacher.

557
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,070
I need to get out of here.

558
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:40,210
Now. If he thinks I took
off with his money...

559
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:41,830
Who?

560
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:45,550
You ain't arrested me.

561
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:48,580
Everything you got is circumstantial.

562
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,550
So some people cut
their fingers in my car.

563
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:58,090
You got any bodies, aside from this loser
who took the wrong cell phone at the gym?

564
00:29:58,090 --> 00:29:59,460
I know my rights,man.

565
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,930
You got to arrest me or let me go.

566
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:05,180
What's it gonna be,fellas?

567
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,980
Yeah,that's what I thought,too.

568
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:09,020
Whoa,hold on.

569
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:15,480
What is that?

570
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:25,670
Arrest it is. Our forensic tech traced the blood
in your car to an unsolved quintuple homicide.

571
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:29,040
So,sit down, you walking midlife crisis!

572
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,490
This is nuts,man! I didn't kill anybody!

573
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:33,830
That blood is ten years old!

574
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:35,500
The car's from a police impound!

575
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,680
So how are you driving it?

576
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:47,520
'Cause my name isn't Eddie Macklin.

577
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:50,610
It's Special Agent Edward McKenzie.

578
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:52,350
I work for the Secret Service.

579
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:56,920
And you two are about to blow a
highly-classified six-month op.

580
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:04,040
Our financial crimes division has been
working a money-laundering case for over year.

581
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,790
We traced one of the sources
of the cash to the Tower Gym.

582
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,160
I went in undercover.

583
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,380
Found out the cash came from a
bank-robbery gang run by the owner,

584
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:14,080
Elijah Banner, and his girlfriend.

585
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:15,970
There's our mystery woman from the bank.

586
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:19,310
Elijah told me to rent a safe deposit box
there so she and I could case the place.

587
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,640
Oh,were you casing her,too?

588
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,260
Sorry,guys.Boss,she's like
a cat. When she found out...

589
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,650
Hello,Diane.

590
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:30,930
Oh,I heard we broke up.Sorry about
that.Oh,and I'm a Secret Service agent.

591
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:33,050
I heard. What's with the attitude?

592
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,740
I don't know. Maybe
it's,you were sleeping...

593
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,560
...with your ex-husband
 while we were dating.

594
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:39,780
Man has a point.

595
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,360
You guys are buddies now?

596
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,280
Yeah. We were thinking
of starting a club.

597
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,450
Yeah?

598
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:49,240
Well,watch it,boys.

599
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,340
I know something about
each and every one of you

600
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:58,100
that you don't want anybody else
to know.And I got a Twitter account.

601
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,850
We need to get back to work.

602
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,090
Hey,let go of me!

603
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,050
- Come on!
- You take your hands off me right now!

604
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,090
sorry

605
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:12,690
So,how was Corporal Flegman involved?

606
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:16,400
Flegman drove the getaway car,but
Elijah thought he was skimming.

607
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,780
Looks like Elijah finally
did something about it.

608
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,070
Why haven't you taken this guy down?

609
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,270
He keeps his hands too clean.

610
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,900
We need to catch him in the act.

611
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:26,040
When you picked me up,I was
collecting gear for his next robbery.

612
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,160
But if Elijah thinks I
took off with his money,

613
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,910
six months of work goes down the drain.

614
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:31,800
We can get him for Flegman's murder.

615
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:35,280
No way he pulled the trigger.I'm
guessing it was his girlfriend.

616
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,670
She's the clown.
Freelances at kids' parties.

617
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:40,000
We want to get this guy, we
need to put the money back,

618
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:43,590
and I need to get back on the
street before he notices I'm gone.

619
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:51,100
It's Elijah.

620
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,320
He's noticed.

621
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,350
I got to answer it.

622
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:56,820
Yeah,put it on speaker.

623
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:00,310
Yo,E,what's the word,man?

624
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:02,360
Cut the bull, I know you got pinched.

625
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,580
Put agent Fornell on the line.

626
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,700
Agent Fornell.

627
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:16,390
You got something of mine.
I got something of yours.

628
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:19,860
Dad,I'm in a white van, no
windows,I can smell pine...

629
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:24,720
You ever want to see your daughter
again,you give me back my money.

630
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,720
I'll be in touch.

631
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,920
I said everybody, every asset we have.

632
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,310
He's got my daughter, for God's sake.

633
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:44,480
We found a camera hidden
in the storage locker.

634
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,180
Must be how Elijah
knew we had his money.

635
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,600
He watched us collect the evidence.

636
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,460
We need to be ready when he calls.

637
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:52,150
I have friends standing by
to help trace the callback.

638
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:55,300
Right. His apartment's been
cleaned out,he's running.

639
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,470
Any word on the BOLO?

640
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:59,160
Police are stopping every
windowless white van they see.

641
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,490
Your daughter was very brave.

642
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:03,990
They found a broken window in
the kitchen.He was in our house.

643
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,410
It's gonna be, it's okay,babe.

644
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,080
Okay. It's okay.

645
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:10,920
Emily's gonna be all right.

646
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,050
DiNozzo,what do you got?

647
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,870
Elijah's girlfriend is dead.

648
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:16,010
Looks like he's tying up loose ends.

649
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:17,680
You got any idea where he's going?

650
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,290
Well,no,

651
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:23,300
but he's not improvising.We found
surveillance photos of Fornell and Emily.

652
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:27,300
Elijah probably started making exit plans
the moment you two showed up at his studio.

653
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,100
Zeroed in on your daughter
as a lever he could pull.

654
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:32,470
Blocked call.

655
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,860
Tony,keep us posted.

656
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:34,840
Will do.

657
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:39,530
Agent Fornell.

658
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:41,280
I just texted you my location.

659
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,700
I want you to send that girl.

660
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:45,740
The one who helped you
clear out my storage locker.

661
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,450
She's got eight minutes to bring me

662
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,910
my money,by herself.

663
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:52,460
Once I'm safely away,I'll
tell you where you daughter is.

664
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:56,530
She's fine. But if you even think
of sending anyone else, I'll know.

665
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:59,470
And your daughter will pay the price.

666
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:00,800
Okay.

667
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,390
Okay,but just so we're on the same page:

668
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:08,880
if so much as touch a hair on my daughter's
head,so help me God,I will find you.

669
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:13,050
and I will rip your eyes out of your face
and shove them so far down your throat

670
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:15,480
you'll need a proctologist
to read the evening paper.

671
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:17,880
He hung up.

672
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:19,440
What's the move,boss?

673
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:23,220
No,this is your call,Tobias.

674
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,250
Bishop,you're the analyst.

675
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,230
Is he gonna let my daughter
go if we give him his money?

676
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,370
Yes. He's demonstrated...

677
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:40,010
I've got it.

678
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:44,580
I just need to know
if you are up for this.

679
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,920
Yes.

680
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:54,020
Then we give him his money. Gibbs?

681
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,390
No tricks.

682
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:57,440
You can catch him later.

683
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,690
We just want our daughter back.

684
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,790
Comm check.

685
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,790
Yeah,we read you.

686
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:11,210
How you doing,Bishop?

687
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,040
I'm fine,surprisingly.

688
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,790
Tell Agent Fornell I can do this.

689
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,330
He's in the conference
room with Diane,but,will do.

690
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:20,750
Okay,so...

691
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:22,970
I guess I just sit somewhere and wait?

692
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,390
No,keep moving.

693
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,120
Avoid a static blind spot.

694
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:29,060
Remember,this guy's a killer.You
don't want him sneaking up on you.

695
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:31,590
Okay,less fine now.

696
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:36,060
Wait,I see something.

697
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:38,020
There's a jogger approaching.

698
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,470
Right build.

699
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,140
It's him,no white van.

700
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,330
All right.

701
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:50,410
- Dump the cash  in here.
- Okay.

702
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,810
Where's Emily?

703
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:59,490
- Take this.
- Okay.

704
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,340
- Wait here.
- Okay.

705
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,660
When I'm clear,I'll call
you with Emily's location.

706
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:07,680
That was the deal.

707
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,100
Okay.

708
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,930
It's done.

709
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:18,190
I've lost sight of him.

710
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:20,940
But he gave me a cell phone,said he
was gonna call with Emily's location.

711
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,680
Any way to find out
where that cell's been?

712
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,360
We can run its IMEI number.

713
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:29,460
Right. If we find out where it's been,we
might be able to figure out where he's going.

714
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:31,100
Yeah,do it.

715
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:33,080
Okay,uh,it'll just take a minute.

716
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:52,210
Aah,what was that noise?

717
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:53,890
I don't know.

718
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,640
Give me a sit-rep.

719
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:58,100
Okay.

720
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,980
Okay,this doesn't make any sense.

721
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:04,230
There's no upside to killing her.

722
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,520
He's made all the right moves,so far.

723
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:10,820
So what's the play?

724
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:14,700
He can't use the white van to get
away--Emily's description made sure of that.

725
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,110
Bishop,report.

726
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:21,030
Okay,he doesn't want to risk calling.

727
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:25,740
But he has to know if Emily isn't found
ASAP,he's looking at an AMBER Alert.

728
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,910
Then he'll never get away.

729
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:32,410
So,how does she get found?

730
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:39,270
He painted the van.

731
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:40,970
Damn it.

732
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,940
Wait,wait, wait,wait,wait!

733
00:38:57,570 --> 00:38:58,740
You okay?

734
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:05,250
Okay,you're okay.

735
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:08,050
You're okay. I'm gonna
get you out of here,okay?

736
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:09,780
Hang on.

737
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:16,200
Dad..Mom.

738
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:19,260
I'm so glad you're all right.

739
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,340
I love you.

740
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,180
I was so worried about you.

741
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,320
Nice work.

742
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,770
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

743
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:32,490
Next time you take your
earwig out of your ear,

744
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:34,020
Bishop...

745
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,780
I'm gonna use a staple gun.

746
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,410
Yeah,uh,I was worried if the Fornells
found out about the cell phone...

747
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,250
Yeah. Yeah,I know.

748
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,870
Like I said...

749
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:46,170
Nice work.

750
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,340
Thanks.

751
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,870
I need another hug.

752
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:55,210
- I am so proud of you,baby.
- Oh,I am,too.

753
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:57,380
I'm fine. He didn't hurt me.

754
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:00,300
I was just so worried about
you guys-- are-are you okay?

755
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,100
Oh,yeah,we're... Oh,oh,yeah.

756
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:06,000
We're just so happy that
we're all together again.

757
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:11,720
And we-we're just so glad that-that
you're safe and you're back.

758
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:17,620
Hey,any word?

759
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:20,550
Nothing. No sign at the
airports or train station.

760
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:23,780
McGee's talking to Highway Patrol, but
I got a sinking feeling he got away.

761
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,430
Oh, he didn't get away.

762
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:30,160
My last name is Fornell,after all.

763
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:46,510
Freeze.

764
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,480
You're under arrest.

765
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,320
No. Move...

766
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,820
so I can shoot you.

767
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,690
I'm not carrying a cell.

768
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:56,990
This bike's untraceable.
How'd you find me?

769
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,230
We didn't.

770
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,530
My daughter did.

771
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:04,950
Say hello...

772
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:06,870
to her Happy Cat "Friend Alert" watch.

773
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:08,250
It's Bluetooth enabled.

774
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:12,290
It beeps any time a friend wearing
the same watch gets within 30 feet.

775
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:16,260
Course,I had to boost the range on
the second watch to track you,but...

776
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,290
That little bitch.

777
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,930
Watch your mouth.

778
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:23,100
I'd hate to get suspended,and Agent
Gibbs already has enough paperwork.

779
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:25,390
I should have never let her go.

780
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:27,520
I'm sorry,Gibbs.

781
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:35,200
It's okay.

782
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,550
Eh,told you he'd run.

783
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,170
Come on.

784
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,930
We just came to say thank you.

785
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,480
You already said thank you.

786
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,680
This time we brought liquor.

787
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,430
Well,then,you're welcome.

788
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,470
And...

789
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:16,240
And we have a request.

790
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,740
Oh,I can't wait.

791
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:23,050
Oh,will you stop with your whining?I mean,you're
a grown man.It-it's,it's unattractive.

792
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:24,160
What are you doing?

793
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:25,780
We're here to ask a favor
and you're insulting the man.

794
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,150
He has been carrying on
like he lost his dolly.

795
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,870
He hasn't said five
words since he's got here.

796
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:34,490
Anyway,we'll be out of
your hair in a minute.

797
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:35,590
It's just...

798
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:36,670
It's just that...

799
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,830
Well,uh,you've probably noticed that...

800
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:40,960
Tobias
and I--

801
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,260
clearly gluttons
for punishment--

802
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:46,050
are trying to make a
second go of things.

803
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:47,430
And,uh,we...

804
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,520
We,um...

805
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,840
We...

806
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,690
Oh,for Pete's sake.

807
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:55,560
We want your blessing.

808
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,180
My what?

809
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:59,410
Your blessing.

810
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:01,280
It's very important to Diane.

811
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,480
And me.

812
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,120
That we have your blessing.

813
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,240
Why?

814
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,120
Because it-it...

815
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:13,160
What is with the 50
questions,do we have it or not?

816
