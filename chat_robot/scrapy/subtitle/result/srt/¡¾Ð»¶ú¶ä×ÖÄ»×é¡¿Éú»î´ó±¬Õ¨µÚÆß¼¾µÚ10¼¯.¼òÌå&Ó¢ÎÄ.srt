1
00:00:01,148 --> 00:00:02,548
生活大爆炸前情提要
Previously on The Big Bang Theory...

2
00:00:03,265 --> 00:00:04,865
Sheldon  难道你刚刚是想出了
Sheldon, did you just figure out

3
00:00:04,867 --> 00:00:08,135
合成新型稳定超重元素的方法了?
a method for synthesizing a new stable super-heavy element?

4
00:00:08,256 --> 00:00:09,939
我有吗?!
Did I?!

5
00:00:09,941 --> 00:00:11,207
这不太可能
Well, that can't be right.

6
00:00:11,209 --> 00:00:12,908
这事前无古人啊
No one's ever done that before.

7
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,376
除了我  因为我刚刚做到啦!
Except me because I just did it!

8
00:00:14,378 --> 00:00:16,545
# Sheldon和他的大脑  万岁! #
# Sheldon and his brain, yeah

9
00:00:16,547 --> 00:00:18,581
# Sheldon和他的大脑  万岁! #
# Sheldon and his brain, yeah! #

10
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:20,949
我犯了一个致命的错误
I've made a horrible mistake.

11
00:00:20,951 --> 00:00:22,051
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

12
00:00:22,053 --> 00:00:24,786
这个表格  单位是平方厘米
This table, it's in square centimeters

13
00:00:24,788 --> 00:00:26,805
我把它当成平方米读了
I read it as square meters.

14
00:00:26,807 --> 00:00:28,257
你知道意味着什么吗
You know what that means?

15
00:00:28,259 --> 00:00:30,843
美国人搞不定公制单位?
That Americans can't handle the metric system?

16
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:36,265
Amy  我差了整整1万倍
Amy, I was off by a factor of 10,000.

17
00:00:36,267 --> 00:00:38,684
但是中国科学家找到了该元素
But the Chinese team found the element.

18
00:00:38,686 --> 00:00:39,652
是啊  他们不该找到的
Yeah, well, they shouldn't have.

19
00:00:39,654 --> 00:00:41,604
我的计算有误
My calculations were wrong.

20
00:00:41,606 --> 00:00:43,572
我一生中最重要的发现
The greatest scientific achievement of my life

21
00:00:43,574 --> 00:00:45,307
却是来自一个错误
is based on a blunder.

22
00:00:45,309 --> 00:00:46,609
我不是个天才
I'm not a genius.

23
00:00:46,611 --> 00:00:47,943
而是个骗子
I'm a fraud.

24
00:00:47,945 --> 00:00:50,112
Sheldon你要知道  在神经学里
You know, Sheldon, in neuroscience,

25
00:00:50,114 --> 00:00:52,814
我们永远会在大脑某部分发现
we're forever finding something in one part of the brain

26
00:00:52,816 --> 00:00:54,283
本以为在其他地方的东西
that we thought was someplace else.

27
00:00:54,285 --> 00:00:56,985
噢  太好了  我现在连骗子都不如
Oh, great, now I'm worse than a fraud.

28
00:00:56,987 --> 00:00:59,154
我成生物学家了  
I'm practically a biologist.

29
00:01:01,758 --> 00:01:04,260
这是科学星期五  我是Ira Flatow
This is Science Friday. I'm Ira Flatow.

30
00:01:04,262 --> 00:01:07,596
我们今天的嘉宾是发现首个稳定超重元素的
My guest today is responsible for the discovery of the first

31
00:01:07,598 --> 00:01:10,165
科学家
stable super-heavy element.

32
00:01:10,167 --> 00:01:11,684
欢迎  Sheldon Cooper博士
Welcome, Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

33
00:01:11,686 --> 00:01:13,435
谢谢
Thank you.

34
00:01:13,437 --> 00:01:15,020
唔  学校叫我过来的
Uh, the university made me come here.

35
00:01:15,022 --> 00:01:16,505
我一点也不想来
I didn't want to.

36
00:01:17,324 --> 00:01:20,359
厄  我是这个节目的粉丝
Uh, big fan of the show.

37
00:01:20,361 --> 00:01:23,345
那么  我知道你实际上是误打误撞
So, I understand that you actually discovered

38
00:01:23,347 --> 00:01:25,531
才找到这个元素的
this element by mistake.

39
00:01:27,485 --> 00:01:29,318
是的
Yes.

40
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,371
在科学圈里有人把这个现象称作
And some people in the science community are calling it

41
00:01:32,373 --> 00:01:34,356
"神奇的大错误"
"The Wonder Blunder."

42
00:01:34,358 --> 00:01:36,024
谁说的?  把他们名字告诉我
Who? Give me their names.

43
00:01:36,026 --> 00:01:37,910
我打赌肯定是Wolowitz
I bet it's Wolowitz.

44
00:01:37,912 --> 00:01:40,296
这真是个神奇的故事
It's just such a fascinating story.

45
00:01:40,298 --> 00:01:41,830
你的计算差的十万八千里
Your calculations are way off,

46
00:01:41,832 --> 00:01:44,199
但是他们却找到了这个元素
but they find the element anyway.

47
00:01:44,201 --> 00:01:46,502
就好像读错了藏宝图
It's like misreading a treasure map

48
00:01:46,504 --> 00:01:48,921
却仍找到了宝藏
and still finding the treasure.

49
00:01:48,923 --> 00:01:50,923
我们能聊聊其他的吗?
Can we talk about something else?

50
00:01:50,925 --> 00:01:53,509
你知道我会约德尔唱法吗?
Do you know that I yodel?

51
00:01:55,845 --> 00:01:57,229
有意思  但是这个发现有可能会帮你
That's interesting, but this could be taking you

52
00:01:57,231 --> 00:01:59,982
打通获得诺贝尔奖之路
down the path toward a Nobel Prize.

53
00:01:59,984 --> 00:02:01,350
毫无疑问是化学奖
And in chemistry, no less.

54
00:02:01,352 --> 00:02:03,502
不是很奇怪吗?
And wouldn't that be unusual?

55
00:02:03,504 --> 00:02:05,854
因为你是个物理学家
Because you're a physicist.

56
00:02:05,856 --> 00:02:08,157
是啊  是啊  我将会是个获得诺贝尔化学奖的物理学家
Yes, yes, I'd be a physicist with a Nobel in chemistry.

57
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:10,359
人人都会嘲笑这个马戏团的怪物
Everyone laugh at the circus freak.

58
00:02:11,611 --> 00:02:14,163
你知道吗  Flatow  我没必要呆在这里忍受这些
You know, I don't need to sit here and take this, Flatow.

59
00:02:14,165 --> 00:02:16,498
正是因为像你这些恶人
It is because of bullies like you,

60
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,200
越来越多的美国人
every day more and more Americans

61
00:02:18,202 --> 00:02:20,703
才选择看电视了
are making the switch to television.

生活大爆炸第七季第十集

72
00:02:51,175 --> 00:02:53,810
Seibert校长  我不知道为啥你要冲我吼
President Seibert, I don't know why you're yelling.

73
00:02:53,812 --> 00:02:56,179
就是你逼我去上节目的
You're the one who made me go on the radio.

74
00:02:56,181 --> 00:02:59,016
我还以为是一个专业的科学访谈
I was expecting a professional science interview,

75
00:02:59,018 --> 00:03:02,836
而不是收到那些哗众取宠的名嘴的攻击
not an attack by some morning zoo shock jock.

76
00:03:04,305 --> 00:03:06,239
好吧  如果大学这么需要钱
Well, if the university needs money so badly,

77
00:03:06,241 --> 00:03:09,026
也许你应该准备一个脏话罐 
(脏话罐: 说脏话就要向里面投钱的罐子)
perhaps you should start a swear jar.

78
00:03:10,328 --> 00:03:13,363
哇!  你刚才说的话可要投一美金了
Whoa! That one's worth a dollar.

79
00:03:14,665 --> 00:03:16,033
我知道你不喜欢这样
I know you don't like it,

80
00:03:16,035 --> 00:03:17,367
但是每次你去参加访谈
but every time you do an interview,

81
00:03:17,369 --> 00:03:19,402
都会增加学校的声誉
it raises the profile of the university.

82
00:03:19,404 --> 00:03:21,071
那会带来更多的资助
That translates to funding.

83
00:03:21,073 --> 00:03:22,089
是啊  但是我不是被训练
Yeah, well, I'm not just

84
00:03:22,091 --> 00:03:25,909
靠跳舞来赚钱的猴子
some trained monkey dancing for coins.

85
00:03:25,911 --> 00:03:27,010
你当然不是
Of course you're not.

86
00:03:27,012 --> 00:03:29,046
人们喜欢那些猴子
People love trained monkeys.

87
00:03:31,265 --> 00:03:32,299
你有什么好不开心的?
How can you not be happy?

88
00:03:32,301 --> 00:03:34,017
你又高又瘦还出名
You're tall, thin and famous.

89
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:37,137
偶滴神啊  我居然在嫉妒Sheldon
Oh, my God, I'm jealous of Sheldon.

90
00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:39,973
听着  你还得做这些事情做一段时间
Look, you're gonna be doing this stuff for a while.

91
00:03:39,975 --> 00:03:42,359
你必须找到接受它的方法
You're just gonna have to find a way to get used to it.

92
00:03:42,361 --> 00:03:44,260
你们没人能理解这种感受
But none of you know what this is like.

93
00:03:44,262 --> 00:03:47,430
别人一直在庆祝一件你希望自己从没干过的事情
Being celebrated for something you wish you never did.

94
00:03:47,432 --> 00:03:50,650
唔  你肯定没跟我去过狂欢节
Mmm... you clearly haven't been with me at Mardi Gras.

95
00:03:54,122 --> 00:03:56,289
可以停一下游戏来帮我打扫一下吗?
Want to pause the video game and help me clean up?

96
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:57,457
我正在打扫呢
I am cleaning up.

97
00:03:57,459 --> 00:03:59,876
看看小丑把这哥谭市弄得一团糟
Look at the mess the Joker made of Gotham City.

98
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:03,914
拜托  要过来住的可是你哥们
Come on, it's your friend who's coming to stay here.

99
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,298
Raj在印度长大
Raj grew up in India.

100
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,634
相信我  他看过更乱的
Trust me, he's seen worse.

101
00:04:08,302 --> 00:04:09,452
Howie!
Howie.

102
00:04:09,454 --> 00:04:10,637
我保证在接下来的这一周
I promise I'll help out

103
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:11,671
我会帮你打扫的
the rest of the week.

104
00:04:11,673 --> 00:04:12,806
接下来的这一周?
The rest of the week?

105
00:04:12,808 --> 00:04:14,624
你说只是住一两天
You said it was just gonna be a night or two.

106
00:04:14,626 --> 00:04:15,675
好吧  如果我说住一个礼拜
Yeah, but if I told you a week,

107
00:04:15,677 --> 00:04:16,593
你会同意吗?
would you have said yes?

108
00:04:16,595 --> 00:04:20,347
-不!  -那你让我没得选啦
-No! -Then you left me no choice.

109
00:04:20,349 --> 00:04:24,017
我喜欢Raj  但是这也住的太久啦
I love Raj, but that's a long time for a house guest.

110
00:04:24,019 --> 00:04:25,685
我知道  但是他们在装修大楼
I know, but they're tenting his building.

111
00:04:25,687 --> 00:04:28,071
而且他也找不到既能让狗住又让他满意的酒店
He can't find a hotel he likes that allows dogs.

112
00:04:28,073 --> 00:04:29,639
他还要带着肉桂儿?
He's bringing Cinnamon?

113
00:04:29,641 --> 00:04:30,640
在这住一个礼拜!
For a whole week!

114
00:04:30,642 --> 00:04:32,659
某些人胆子实在太大了
The nerve of some people.

115
00:04:35,196 --> 00:04:39,116
尴尬快车来了
Here comes the Embarrassment Express.

116
00:04:39,984 --> 00:04:42,586
将要在欺诈市
With stops at Fraudville...

117
00:04:42,588 --> 00:04:45,088
神奇的大错误山
WonderBlunderberg...

118
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:48,041
还有堪萨斯城停车
and Kansas City.

119
00:04:48,043 --> 00:04:49,309
因为它是个中转站
Because it's a hub.

120
00:04:51,814 --> 00:04:53,280
Sheldon  我能进来吗
Sheldon, can I come in?

121
00:04:53,282 --> 00:04:54,931
-你有曲奇饼吗  -没有
-Do you have cookies? -No.

122
00:04:54,933 --> 00:04:56,883
好  我不配吃曲奇饼  进来吧
Good. I don't deserve cookies. Come in.

123
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:00,170
Wil...?
Wil...?

124
00:05:00,172 --> 00:05:01,104
嗨  Sheldon
Hey, Sheldon.

125
00:05:01,106 --> 00:05:02,022
好久没见
It's been a while.

126
00:05:02,024 --> 00:05:03,523
你来干啥?
Why are you here?

127
00:05:03,525 --> 00:05:04,558
Amy告诉我你最近过的不好
Amy said you were having a rough time,

128
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,143
我想也许我们能聊聊
and I thought maybe we could talk.

129
00:05:06,145 --> 00:05:07,010
可以吗?
Is that okay?

130
00:05:07,012 --> 00:05:08,645
当然
Certainly.

131
00:05:08,647 --> 00:05:09,679
尽管...
Although...

132
00:05:09,681 --> 00:05:11,231
现在我就感到很不舒服
right now, I'm having a rough time

133
00:05:11,233 --> 00:05:12,899
因为有三个人在我的房间里
because there's three people in my room,

134
00:05:12,901 --> 00:05:15,919
感觉像是在迪斯科舞厅一样
and it's starting to feel like a discotheque.

135
00:05:17,371 --> 00:05:19,573
Sheldon你说你因为别人总是注意那些
Sheldon, you said you were unhappy getting attention

136
00:05:19,575 --> 00:05:21,858
你希望自己从未做过的事而不开心
for something you wished you never did.

137
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,693
嗯  我处理这些有点经验
Yeah, I know a little something about that.

138
00:05:23,695 --> 00:05:25,745
哦  Wil你胡说  
Oh, nonsense, Wil.

139
00:05:25,747 --> 00:05:29,299
你没完没了的微博没有那么挫啦
Your endless tweets are not that bad.

140
00:05:29,301 --> 00:05:31,718
我想起来为什么这么久没见他了
I remember why it's been a while.

141
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,171
Sheldon  我说的是我小时候
Sheldon, I was actually talking

142
00:05:34,173 --> 00:05:35,872
演星际迷航的事情
about when I was a kid on Star Trek.

143
00:05:35,874 --> 00:05:38,391
你怎么会不喜欢
How could you not like getting attention

144
00:05:38,393 --> 00:05:39,876
扮演Wesley Crusher带来的关注
for playing Wesley Crusher?

145
00:05:39,878 --> 00:05:41,995
你演的很棒啊
You were wonderful.

146
00:05:41,997 --> 00:05:44,731
一个拥有高清记忆能力无所不知的天才少年
A know-it-all boy genius with an eidetic memory.

147
00:05:44,733 --> 00:05:47,567
谁不会感同身受?
Who couldn't relate to that?

148
00:05:48,436 --> 00:05:50,237
额  不是所有人这么想的
Well, not everybody felt that way.

149
00:05:50,239 --> 00:05:51,988
好多人讨厌那个角色
A lot of people really hated the character,

150
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:54,241
还有人因为这个角色而讨厌我
and some of them hated me because of it.

151
00:05:54,243 --> 00:05:55,225
我上访谈节目
I would do interviews,

152
00:05:55,227 --> 00:05:56,893
那些人对我也很苛刻
and people would be mean to me.

153
00:05:56,895 --> 00:05:59,162
我也是这样
That just happened to me.

154
00:05:59,164 --> 00:06:00,914
下次你疯狂发微博的时候
Next time you're stuck for a tweet,

155
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:04,201
你可以吐槽Ira Flatow的坏人品
feel free to say what a jerk Ira Flatow is.

156
00:06:04,203 --> 00:06:07,287
Sheldon关键是Wil学会接受那段生活
Sheldon, the point is Wil learned to embrace

157
00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:10,573
然后向更美好的方向继续前行
that part of his life and moved on to bigger and better things.

158
00:06:10,575 --> 00:06:12,075
是啊  我现在是个作家
Yeah, I'm an author now,

159
00:06:12,077 --> 00:06:13,627
我还会做一些公共演说
I do public speaking,

160
00:06:13,629 --> 00:06:15,795
而且我还有一些关于棋盘游戏的网站
and I have my own Web series about board games.

161
00:06:15,797 --> 00:06:17,180
额...
Uh...

162
00:06:17,182 --> 00:06:19,049
我们是想让他开心  所以...
We're trying to cheer him up, so...

163
00:06:24,055 --> 00:06:26,022
我想说的是我曾经一度以为
I'm just saying that there was a time

164
00:06:26,024 --> 00:06:28,525
我再也无法逃脱Wesley Crusher的阴影的
when I thought I would never get out of Wesley Crusher's shadow.

165
00:06:28,527 --> 00:06:29,859
但是现在
But now,

166
00:06:29,861 --> 00:06:32,312
那只是我快乐生活的一小部分
it's just one small part of a pretty great life,

167
00:06:32,314 --> 00:06:34,430
而且我很高兴我度过了那样一段时光
and it's a part that I'm happy is there.

168
00:06:34,432 --> 00:06:36,733
我知道你想说什么了
I do see what you're saying.

169
00:06:36,735 --> 00:06:38,235
很有帮助
That helps.

170
00:06:38,237 --> 00:06:39,369
太好了
Good.

171
00:06:39,371 --> 00:06:40,604
你们俩想留下来
Would you two like to stay

172
00:06:40,606 --> 00:06:41,638
和我一起玩火车游戏吗?
and play trains with me?

173
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,706
-当然  -没问题
-Sure. -Okay.

174
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:43,773
太好了
Oh, great!

175
00:06:43,775 --> 00:06:47,110
现在...
Now...

176
00:06:47,112 --> 00:06:48,111
我负责控制
I work the controls.

177
00:06:48,113 --> 00:06:49,296
我说"开动了"
I say "All aboard"

178
00:06:49,298 --> 00:06:52,282
你们就静静的坐着看
You sit quietly and watch.

179
00:06:52,284 --> 00:06:54,384
我能吹口哨吗?
Can I blow the whistle?

180
00:06:55,753 --> 00:06:57,754
你还是走吧
You should probably go.

181
00:07:05,313 --> 00:07:07,414
你这是要在我沙发上刷牙么?
You're gonna brush your teeth on my couch?

182
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:10,567
不  我是要刷肉桂儿的牙
No, I'm gonna brush Cinnamon's teeth.

183
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:11,685
何必呢?
Why bother?

184
00:07:11,687 --> 00:07:14,321
一半的时间她都是在舔屁屁
She spends half the time licking her butt.

186
00:07:15,273 --> 00:07:16,740
还有一半时间是在舔我的脸
And the other half licking my face.

187
00:07:16,742 --> 00:07:18,808
所以我要给她刷牙
That's why I'm brushing her teeth.

188
00:07:20,644 --> 00:07:22,645
嘿  不好意思回来晚了
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm so late.

189
00:07:22,647 --> 00:07:23,646
你们吃过晚饭了吗?
Did you already have dinner?

190
00:07:23,648 --> 00:07:25,248
没呢  在等你
No, we were waiting for you.

191
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,499
你们太贴心了
Aw, that's so sweet.

192
00:07:26,501 --> 00:07:28,752
那当然  所以你打算做什么晚饭?
Yeah. So what do you feel like making?

193
00:07:30,321 --> 00:07:32,505
Howard  你的小可怜刚刚工作回来呢
Howard, the poor thing just got home from work.

195
00:07:32,507 --> 00:07:34,657
我去给你倒杯酒
Let me get you a glass of wine.

196
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:36,176
我来做饭
I'll cook dinner.

197
00:07:36,178 --> 00:07:38,128
-别啊Raj  你是客人  -客气啥呢
-Oh, Raj, you're our guest.  -Don't be silly.

198
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:40,163
你坐  看起来你累了一天了
Sit. You look like you've had a long day.

199
00:07:40,165 --> 00:07:43,149
她看起来总是那样
No, she always looks like that.

200
00:07:45,553 --> 00:07:48,938
因为她嫁给了一个白痴
Because she married an idiot.

201
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:51,591
谢谢你  Raj
Thank you, Raj.

202
00:07:51,593 --> 00:07:54,527
没事儿  这是我感谢的方式
Please, this is my way of thanking you

204
00:07:54,529 --> 00:07:56,363
谢谢你们让我住在这
for letting me stay here.

205
00:07:56,365 --> 00:07:59,316
来  说说你今天怎么样
Now, tell us all about your day.

206
00:07:59,318 --> 00:08:01,318
好的呢  首先呢
Okay, um, well, first,

207
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,286
我开会迟到了  因为堵在路上了
I was late to a meeting 'cause I was stuck in traffic.

208
00:08:03,288 --> 00:08:06,289
我一直叫你手机里安一个实时交通软件的
Well, I keep telling you to put that traffic app on your phone.

209
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,191
喂喂  你今天回家
Hey, when you got home today complaining 

210
00:08:08,193 --> 00:08:09,525
抱怨吃太多软糖不大舒服的时候
that you felt sick from eating too many jelly beans,

211
00:08:09,527 --> 00:08:10,660
我对你指手画脚了吗?
did I tell you how to fix it?

212
00:08:10,662 --> 00:08:11,861
没有!
No.

213
00:08:13,547 --> 00:08:17,533
我跟你说了 "一定很难受吧"  然后摸了摸你的肚子
I said, "Aw, that must hurt," and I rubbed your belly.

214
00:08:20,871 --> 00:08:23,089
我一直都在想着你
I thought of you the whole time.

215
00:08:26,227 --> 00:08:28,178
我想说的就是  有时候你就该安静倾听
All I'm saying is there's a time to just listen.

216
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,512
谢谢
Thank you.

217
00:08:29,514 --> 00:08:31,681
有时候你也得控制不吃太多软糖
There's also a time to stop eating too many jelly beans.

219
00:08:31,683 --> 00:08:33,850
你十岁的时候就该这么做了
And it's when you're ten.

220
00:08:36,654 --> 00:08:38,254
你好  Siebert主席
Hello, President Siebert.

221
00:08:38,256 --> 00:08:39,773
谢谢你接了我的电话
Thank you for taking my call.

222
00:08:39,775 --> 00:08:42,575
我只是想告诉你  本人现在会非常有热情的
I just wanted you to know that you can now expect

223
00:08:42,577 --> 00:08:46,413
参加你鉴于我的重大发现安排的活动
enthusiastic participation from me regarding my discovery.

224
00:08:46,415 --> 00:08:47,697
不不不不不
Oh, no, no, no, no.

225
00:08:47,699 --> 00:08:48,998
没必要谢我
No need to thank me.

226
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,785
谢谢我的朋友  Wil Wheaton
Thank my friend, Wil Wheaton.

227
00:08:51,787 --> 00:08:55,004
我可以告诉你   我可是有9位朋友
For your information, I have nine friends, hmm?

228
00:08:56,207 --> 00:08:59,409
算上你的话有10位哦
Ten if we include you.

229
00:08:59,411 --> 00:09:01,594
那就9位吧
Nine it is.

230
00:09:04,181 --> 00:09:06,182
还是算10位吧
Ah, it's ten.

231
00:09:06,184 --> 00:09:08,017
Wolowitz也算上
I'll count Wolowitz.

232
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:10,770
你好  我的朋友Leonard
Hello, friend Leonard.

233
00:09:10,772 --> 00:09:12,055
你心情不错哟
Hey, you're in a good mood.

234
00:09:12,057 --> 00:09:14,023
我心情大好
I'm in a great mood.

235
00:09:14,025 --> 00:09:15,892
你马上就要心情更好了
Well, you're about to be in an even better one.

236
00:09:15,894 --> 00:09:18,645
本来还不确定的时候我不想说的  但是...
I didn't want to say anything until I knew for sure, but...

238
00:09:18,647 --> 00:09:21,364
我一直在实验室重复测试你的元素
I've been re-running the tests on your element in my lab

239
00:09:21,366 --> 00:09:22,899
而且我已经证明它错误了
and I disproved it.

240
00:09:22,901 --> 00:09:24,701
你的元素根本不存在
Your element does not exist!

241
00:09:25,736 --> 00:09:27,470
但那些中国科研团队是怎么回事?
Yeah, but what about the Chinese research team?

242
00:09:27,472 --> 00:09:28,571
他们明明发现了
They found it.

243
00:09:28,573 --> 00:09:32,442
应该是有人在数据文件里加了模拟信号
Yeah, it turns out someone added simulated signals to the data files.

245
00:09:32,444 --> 00:09:34,127
他们伪造试验结果
They faked the results.

246
00:09:34,129 --> 00:09:35,128
真的?
Really?

247
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:36,863
是呀! 你知道这意味着什么不?
Yes! Do you know what that means?

248
00:09:36,865 --> 00:09:39,883
这意味着你厌恶的所有瞩目都烟消云散了
That means all of this attention that you hate goes away.

249
00:09:39,885 --> 00:09:41,117
所以再也没有什么访问接见了?
So no more interviews?

250
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,118
没有  都没有了
No, it's all over.

251
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,219
真不敢相信
I can't believe it.

252
00:09:43,221 --> 00:09:44,120
不谢
Well, you're welcome.

253
00:09:44,122 --> 00:09:47,056
你夺走了我最伟大的成就!
You robbed me of my greatest achievement!

255
00:09:48,042 --> 00:09:49,008
啥?!
What?!

256
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:51,811
重新回到9位朋友的生活!
I'm back down to nine friends!

257
00:09:51,813 --> 00:09:55,231
还是8位吧... 我也受够Wolowitz了!
Make it eight... I'm sick of Wolowitz, too!

258
00:09:55,233 --> 00:09:57,734
我不懂啊
I... I don't understand.

259
00:09:57,736 --> 00:09:59,352
自从你发现该死的元素
All you've done since you discovered

260
00:09:59,354 --> 00:10:00,770
你一直就是抱怨抱怨
this stupid element was complain.

261
00:10:00,772 --> 00:10:02,105
我是想哄你开心啊!
I was trying to make you happy!

262
00:10:02,107 --> 00:10:04,741
通过夺走我唯一的成名之举吗?
By taking away my only claim to fame?

263
00:10:04,743 --> 00:10:06,409
如果你想让我开心
Well, if you wanted to make me happy,

264
00:10:06,411 --> 00:10:07,827
可以给我讲个笑话啊
you could have told me a joke.

265
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:11,147
或者给我看个树袋熊和水獭
Or shown me a cute video of a koala and an otter

267
00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:12,648
意外做朋友的可爱视频
becoming unlikely friends.

268
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:16,035
怎么对你都不算好啊
Oh, there is no winning with you.

269
00:10:16,037 --> 00:10:18,421
再说树袋熊和水獭根本不生活在一个地方
And koalas and otters don't even live near each other!

270
00:10:18,423 --> 00:10:21,424
所以才让他们的友谊变得意外啊!
That's what makes their friendship unlikely!

271
00:10:21,426 --> 00:10:23,042
嘿
Hey!

272
00:10:23,044 --> 00:10:24,344
你们在吵什么啊?
What's with all the yelling?

273
00:10:24,346 --> 00:10:26,429
Leonard证明了我的元素并不存在
Leonard disproved my element.

274
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,765
现在所有的关注都随风而去了
Now all the attention is going to go away.

275
00:10:28,767 --> 00:10:30,266
那不是很好  你一定很激动吧!
Oh, that's great. You must be thrilled!

276
00:10:30,268 --> 00:10:33,686
到此为止! 我现在只有7位朋友了
That's it! I'm down to seven friends.

277
00:10:33,688 --> 00:10:37,390
他是算上了霍比特人和超级英雄  是吧?
He's counting hobbits and superheroes, right?

278
00:10:37,392 --> 00:10:40,643
当我以为元素是存在的时候  我并不想得到它
When I thought the element was real, I didn't want it.

279
00:10:40,645 --> 00:10:42,479
但是现在Leonard证明了它不存在
But now that Leonard made it not exist,

280
00:10:42,481 --> 00:10:44,981
我想要它胜过世界上的所有东西啊
I want it more than anything in the world.

281
00:10:44,983 --> 00:10:46,566
那元素从来就没存在过啊
The... the element never existed.

282
00:10:46,568 --> 00:10:48,351
又不是我抢走的  是科学抢走的啊
I didn't take it away, science took it away.

283
00:10:48,353 --> 00:10:49,452
生科学的气去吧
Be mad at science.

284
00:10:49,454 --> 00:10:52,455
你怎么敢拿科学来堵我
Don't you dare use science against me.

285
00:10:52,457 --> 00:10:54,991
科学是我最好的朋友!
Science is my best friend!

286
00:10:54,993 --> 00:10:56,459
太好了  我又有8位朋友了
Oh, good, I'm back up to eight.

287
00:10:57,828 --> 00:11:00,046
你能不能告诉他  他已经疯了
Will you tell him he's out of his mind.

288
00:11:00,048 --> 00:11:01,347
其实  我懂他说的话
Actually, I get what he's saying.

289
00:11:01,349 --> 00:11:02,715
太好了! 9位!
Oh, yes! Nine!

290
00:11:02,717 --> 00:11:03,716
欢迎回来  哥们儿
Welcome back, buddy.

291
00:11:06,003 --> 00:11:08,037
就像你在和你不怎么喜欢的男生约会
It's like if you're dating someone you're not that into,

292
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:09,305
然后他们跟你分手了
and then they break up with you

293
00:11:09,307 --> 00:11:10,723
然后你更想得到他们了
and then you want them more than ever.

294
00:11:10,725 --> 00:11:12,425
我完全不知道她在说什么
I have no idea what she's talking about.

295
00:11:12,427 --> 00:11:15,812
但是我们组团对抗你  所以我赞同
but we're ganged up on you so I agree.

296
00:11:16,713 --> 00:11:18,881
算了  Sheldon  你到底想让我怎么样
Okay, Sheldon, what do you want me to do,

297
00:11:18,883 --> 00:11:20,483
把实验结果藏起来吗?
hide the information?

298
00:11:20,485 --> 00:11:21,851
就算我不发表
If I don't publish it,

299
00:11:21,853 --> 00:11:23,236
迟早会有人发表的
it's just a matter of time before someone else does.

300
00:11:23,238 --> 00:11:25,021
不不不  你当然得发表
No, no, of course you have to publish.

301
00:11:25,023 --> 00:11:26,956
这是你作为科学家的责任
That's your responsibility as a scientist.

302
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,608
不然就违背职业道德了
Doing otherwise would be unethical.

303
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:29,892
你别无选择
You have no choice.

304
00:11:29,894 --> 00:11:31,661
行  我会发表的
Fine, I'll publish.

305
00:11:31,663 --> 00:11:33,363
这家伙简直让人难以置信啊
Can you believe this guy?

306
00:11:43,479 --> 00:11:45,480
哇! Raj把碗给洗了
Aw! Raj did the dishes.

307
00:11:45,482 --> 00:11:47,032
你怎么知道不是我洗的?
How do you know I didn't do them?

308
00:11:47,034 --> 00:11:48,767
因为有一次  所有的刀都没洗
Because once, when all the knives were dirty,

309
00:11:48,769 --> 00:11:51,603
你直接用钥匙切的面包
you cut a bagel with your keys.

310
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:54,873
早上好  各位
Good morning, everybody.

311
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:57,008
我出去买了咖啡
I picked up coffee while I was out.

312
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:59,628
Bernadette  这是你的薄荷摩卡加豆奶
Bernadette, here's your soy peppermint mocha.

313
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,797
哇  你不需要帮我买的
Aw, you didn't have to do that.

314
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:02,931
荣幸之至啊
Oh, my pleasure, and don't worry

315
00:12:02,933 --> 00:12:03,999
还有  别担心你今天的演讲
about your presentation today.

316
00:12:04,001 --> 00:12:05,217
你会表现很棒的
You're gonna be great.

317
00:12:05,219 --> 00:12:07,419
没错  你一定会完美收工的
Yeah, you're gonna knock it out of the park.

318
00:12:07,421 --> 00:12:09,621
我今天做的是什么演讲?
What presentation do I have today?

319
00:12:11,057 --> 00:12:12,674
去吧
Just go.

320
00:12:16,012 --> 00:12:18,180
他爱你哦
He loves you.

321
00:12:18,182 --> 00:12:19,147
你在干吗?
What are you doing?

322
00:12:19,149 --> 00:12:20,599
你想让我这么没面子么?
Are you trying to make me look bad?

323
00:12:20,601 --> 00:12:22,133
我就想做个好客人啊
I'm just being a good house guest.

324
00:12:22,135 --> 00:12:23,602
才不是  你是在扮演一个比我更好的丈夫角色
No, you're being a better husband than I am.

325
00:12:23,604 --> 00:12:25,353
洗碗  买咖啡
Doing the dishes, getting coffee,

326
00:12:25,355 --> 00:12:26,571
了解她的生活...
knowing about her life...

327
00:12:26,573 --> 00:12:28,473
谁会这么做啊?
who does that?

328
00:12:28,475 --> 00:12:31,109
拜托  我也给你买了一杯啊
Oh, come on, I brought you one, too.

329
00:12:31,111 --> 00:12:32,794
我不想喝咖啡
I don't want coffee.

330
00:12:32,796 --> 00:12:34,246
所以我买了热巧克力
That's why I got you hot chocolate.

331
00:12:34,248 --> 00:12:36,331
快给我
Give me that.

332
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:39,034
别在让我出丑了行么
Just stop showing me up.

333
00:12:39,036 --> 00:12:40,585
Howard  你听我说
Howard, listen to me.

334
00:12:40,587 --> 00:12:41,986
你是个好丈夫
You're a great husband.

335
00:12:41,988 --> 00:12:44,589
当然你的倾听技术还有待加强
Yes, your listening skills could use some work.

336
00:12:44,591 --> 00:12:47,793
但是作为一个被母亲溺爱大的独生子
But it's amazing how far you've come given that you're

337
00:12:47,795 --> 00:12:51,263
你已经做得很棒了
an only child raised by an over-protective mom.

338
00:12:51,265 --> 00:12:53,882
这是不是变得有点诡异?
Um, is this getting weird?

339
00:12:53,884 --> 00:12:54,933
等下
Hang on.

340
00:12:59,388 --> 00:13:02,224
确实很诡异
So, yes.

341
00:13:03,392 --> 00:13:05,594
嘿
Hey.

342
00:13:05,596 --> 00:13:07,946
我就是想通知你我已经把实验结果发表了
I just wanted to let you know that I-I posted my findings.

343
00:13:07,948 --> 00:13:09,180
我看见了
I saw.

344
00:13:09,182 --> 00:13:10,532
我刚才
And I just

345
00:13:10,534 --> 00:13:12,617
发出了收回我论文的声明
posted a retraction of my paper.

346
00:13:12,619 --> 00:13:15,620
现在整个科学界都知道我犯错了
Now the whole scientific community knows I was wrong.

347
00:13:15,622 --> 00:13:18,290
这是常有的事  Sheldon
These things happen all the time, Sheldon.

348
00:13:18,292 --> 00:13:19,457
对我来说不是
Not to me.

349
00:13:19,459 --> 00:13:21,543
我唯一收回的另一件事便是
The only other retraction I ever had to issue

350
00:13:21,545 --> 00:13:24,212
在我七岁时承认我哥哥是
was when I was seven and I conceded that my brother

351
00:13:24,214 --> 00:13:26,915
德克萨斯东部最好的忍者
was the greatest ninja in East Texas.

352
00:13:28,167 --> 00:13:30,448
但那只是能让我的脑袋从他腋窝下解脱的策略而已
But that was just a ploy to get my face out of his armpit.

353
00:13:31,721 --> 00:13:34,055
你在这呢!
There he is!

354
00:13:35,207 --> 00:13:36,808
这不是我最爱的超级英雄:
It's my favorite superhero

355
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:39,594
回收侠吗!
the Retractor!

356
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:43,398
拜托了  别让他不好过
Come on, don't give him a hard time.

357
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,683
抱歉啦  Cooper
I'm sorry, Cooper.

358
00:13:44,685 --> 00:13:46,885
我"收回"这句话
I retract it.

359
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,654
顺便说一句  Hofstader
By the way, Hofstadter,

360
00:13:49,656 --> 00:13:52,190
驳回中国团队的发现这事干的太好了
nice job disproving the Chinese team.

361
00:13:52,192 --> 00:13:53,275
这没什么大不了的
It's not a big deal.

362
00:13:53,277 --> 00:13:54,910
这很重要好不好
It's a huge deal.

363
00:13:54,912 --> 00:13:57,896
Cooper  也许干物理不是你的强项
Cooper, maybe physics just isn't your thing.

364
00:13:58,898 --> 00:14:00,749
你有没有想过在零售业谋一份工作?
Have you ever considered a career in retail?

365
00:14:00,751 --> 00:14:04,002
这样你就能靠回收东西养家糊口了
That way you could take things back for a living.

366
00:14:05,454 --> 00:14:06,504
好了  Barry  到此为止
Okay, Barry, that's enough.

367
00:14:06,506 --> 00:14:07,906
噢不  这没关系
Oh, no, that's okay.

368
00:14:07,908 --> 00:14:09,875
我的仗我自己来打
I can fight my own battles.

369
00:14:09,877 --> 00:14:12,961
你说对吧  "Bawwy"
Isn't that right, "Bawwy."

370
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,431
这是...?
Is...?

371
00:14:16,433 --> 00:14:19,017
你这是戳我言语障碍的痛处吗?
Is that a reference to my speech impediment?

372
00:14:20,469 --> 00:14:23,054
这太伤人了
That's pretty hurtful.

373
00:14:23,056 --> 00:14:24,472
我...
I...

374
00:14:24,474 --> 00:14:26,474
我没法控制它
I can't control it.

375
00:14:27,944 --> 00:14:29,027
你说得对
You're right,

376
00:14:29,029 --> 00:14:31,062
这太没必要了
That was uncalled for.

377
00:14:31,064 --> 00:14:32,480
我收回这句话
I take it back.

378
00:14:32,482 --> 00:14:33,448
当然你会啦
Of course you do.

379
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:35,450
因为你是回收侠啊!
Because you're the Retractor!

380
00:14:39,822 --> 00:14:41,990
Raj  这顿饭太美味了
Raj, this dinner was amazing.

381
00:14:41,992 --> 00:14:43,107
如果你再住久点
If you're here much longer,

382
00:14:43,109 --> 00:14:45,126
我得去买大一号的衣服了
I'm gonna have to buy bigger clothes.

383
00:14:45,128 --> 00:14:46,110
说什么呢
Nonsense.

384
00:14:46,112 --> 00:14:47,295
你需要长点肉
You need a little fattening up.

385
00:14:47,297 --> 00:14:49,280
你最近看起来太消瘦了
You've been looking too skinny lately.

386
00:14:49,282 --> 00:14:50,615
真贴心
Aw.

387
00:14:50,617 --> 00:14:53,134
Howie  为什么你从来不说像这么贴心的话呢?
Howie, how come you never say anything sweet like that?

388
00:14:53,136 --> 00:14:54,118
你说什么呢?
What are you talking about?

389
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,337
还记得上周  我问你
Remember last week, when I asked you

390
00:14:55,339 --> 00:14:56,721
是不是穿着塑身衣结果你没穿么?
if you were wearing Spanx and you weren't?

391
00:14:56,723 --> 00:14:59,007
这有什么区别吗?
How's that different?

392
00:15:00,509 --> 00:15:02,010
也许你能试着变得更体贴周到
Maybe you could try being more thoughtful,

393
00:15:02,012 --> 00:15:03,628
像你的朋友Raj一样
like your friend Raj.

394
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:06,147
是吗  也许你也能试着变得更像他一样
Yeah, well, maybe you could try being more like Raj.

395
00:15:06,149 --> 00:15:07,232
噢  真的吗?
Oh, really?

396
00:15:07,234 --> 00:15:08,149
真的  那当然
Yeah, yeah.

397
00:15:08,151 --> 00:15:09,567
他早上帮我准备了午餐
He packed me a lunch this morning.

398
00:15:09,569 --> 00:15:12,771
里面还有张便条写着"去打败他们"
And there was a note inside that said, "Go get 'em""

399
00:15:12,773 --> 00:15:15,357
好像我做的还不够一样
Like I don't do enough around here.

400
00:15:15,359 --> 00:15:16,658
现在我还得帮你准备午餐?
Now I need to pack your lunch?

401
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,309
顺便说一句，  你为什么需要一张便条来告诉你
And by the way, why do you need a note telling you

402
00:15:18,311 --> 00:15:19,744
"去打败他们"? 你是个成年人好吗!
to "go get 'em"? You're a grown man!

403
00:15:19,746 --> 00:15:21,079
你应该知道"去打败他们"
You should know to "go get 'em"!

404
00:15:21,981 --> 00:15:23,365
我确实知道"去打败他们"
I do know to "go get 'em""

405
00:15:23,367 --> 00:15:25,050
但有时候当我"出去"并"打败他们"的时候
but sometimes it's nice to have emotional support

406
00:15:25,052 --> 00:15:27,485
有这种精神支持感觉很好!
when I'm going and getting them!

407
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,921
嘿  你们能听见自己在说什么吗?
Hey, hey, do you hear yourselves?

408
00:15:29,923 --> 00:15:33,208
让我们都冷静下退一步讲
Let's just, you know, all calm down and take a step back.

409
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:35,310
这太傻了
This is stupid.

410
00:15:35,312 --> 00:15:36,511
我们为什么要吵架?
Why are we fighting?

411
00:15:36,513 --> 00:15:37,545
我也不知道
I don't know.

412
00:15:37,547 --> 00:15:38,997
我猜我就是感觉
I guess I was just feeling

413
00:15:38,999 --> 00:15:40,832
自己像是个差劲的丈夫
like I'm a lousy husband.

414
00:15:40,834 --> 00:15:42,350
你不是个差劲的丈夫
You're not a lousy husband.

415
00:15:42,352 --> 00:15:43,635
你是个好丈夫
You're a great husband.

416
00:15:43,637 --> 00:15:45,887
我才感觉我自己是个差劲的妻子呢
I was the one feeling like a lousy wife.

417
00:15:45,889 --> 00:15:48,139
你说什么呢? 你是最好的妻子
Are you kidding? You're the best.

418
00:15:48,141 --> 00:15:49,691
我知道问题所在了
I know what the problem is.

419
00:15:49,693 --> 00:15:51,376
就是他!
It's him!

420
00:15:52,194 --> 00:15:54,312
我招谁惹谁啦?
Oh, what did I do?

421
00:15:54,314 --> 00:15:56,681
你让我们觉得我们不够努力
You made us feel like we're not trying hard enough.

422
00:15:56,683 --> 00:15:58,349
就是  我们本来在婚姻的中途好好的
Yeah, we were totally fine half-assing our marriage

423
00:15:58,351 --> 00:16:00,251
直到你出现
till you showed up.

424
00:16:00,253 --> 00:16:02,954
听着  我很抱歉你们对我很生气
Look, I'm sorry you're upset with me,

425
00:16:02,956 --> 00:16:04,656
但我就是想说很高兴看到
but I just have to say it's nice to see

426
00:16:04,658 --> 00:16:06,190
你们站在同一阵线
the two of you on the same page.

427
00:16:06,192 --> 00:16:07,859
是啊  感觉真的很好  
Oh, it does feel good

428
00:16:07,861 --> 00:16:09,461
你终于挺了我一次
to have you backing me up for once.

429
00:16:09,463 --> 00:16:11,778
我一直挺你的好不好! 这也太...
I back you up all the time! That is not...

430
00:16:11,779 --> 00:16:14,146
他又故技重施了! 你丫有病吗?!
He's doing it again! What is wrong with you?!

431
00:16:15,718 --> 00:16:17,419
我真不敢相信他们赶你出来了
I can't believe they kicked you out.

432
00:16:17,421 --> 00:16:21,056
我不敢相信他们竟然还没离婚
I can't believe they're still married.

433
00:16:21,058 --> 00:16:24,559
噢糟了  我把肉桂儿的牙刷忘在Howard家了
Oh, no, I forgot Cinnamon's toothbrush at Howard's.

434
00:16:24,561 --> 00:16:27,312
我想你又得和你爹地我合用啦
I guess you're sharing with Daddy again.

435
00:16:32,351 --> 00:16:34,736
需要我打电话给善待动物组织请叫一声
Bark once if you need me to call PETA.

436
00:16:37,606 --> 00:16:40,325
这只动物在我们公寓做什么呢?
What's that animal doing in our apartment?

437
00:16:40,327 --> 00:16:42,610
别激动  她在箱子里出不来
Oh, relax, she's in her crate. She can't get out.

438
00:16:42,612 --> 00:16:44,329
我给你五个字:
I have two words for you:

439
00:16:44,331 --> 00:16:46,364
侏罗纪公园
Jurassic Park.

440
00:16:46,366 --> 00:16:49,584
这些天真是每况愈下啊
This day just keeps getting worse and worse.

441
00:16:49,586 --> 00:16:51,119
如果能让你好过点...
You know, if it makes you feel any better...

442
00:16:51,121 --> 00:16:52,087
我估计不能
It probably won't.

443
00:16:52,089 --> 00:16:53,204
估计你是对的
You're probably right.

444
00:16:53,206 --> 00:16:56,257
Sheldon  多美的夜晚啊
Sheldon, it's a beautiful night.

445
00:16:56,259 --> 00:16:58,877
要不你和我一起去散个步吧?
Why don't you and I go for a nice walk together?

446
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,429
是不是每件事都能让你性致盎然啊?
Oh, everything is just sex with you isn't it?

447
00:17:02,915 --> 00:17:05,517
Sheldon  我想你可能找到了
Sheldon, I think you might find the support

448
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:07,085
你一直在寻找的支持  如果你能意识到
you're looking for, if you realize

449
00:17:07,087 --> 00:17:09,304
感情有付出和回报
that relationships are a give and take.

450
00:17:09,306 --> 00:17:10,755
只有你对她不离不弃
She can only be there for you

451
00:17:10,757 --> 00:17:12,640
她才会一直在你身边
as much as you are for her.

452
00:17:12,642 --> 00:17:14,442
谢谢你  Rajesh
Thank you, Rajesh.

453
00:17:14,444 --> 00:17:16,761
还有  Amy  你得对Sheldon耐心点
And, Amy, you need to be patient with Sheldon,

454
00:17:16,763 --> 00:17:20,482
别老给他施压让他接受你想要的那种亲密
instead of pressuring him to accept intimacy on your terms.

455
00:17:21,433 --> 00:17:23,768
你还是走人吧
You should probably go.

456
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:36,092
我是Ira Flatow  这里是科学星期五
I'm Ira Flatow, and this is Science Friday.

457
00:17:36,094 --> 00:17:38,194
让我们欢迎Sheldon Cooper博士回来
I'd like to welcome back Dr. Sheldon Cooper,

458
00:17:38,196 --> 00:17:40,280
他认为自己发现了
who thought he had discovered

459
00:17:40,282 --> 00:17:43,032
一种新型的超重元素却不料被
a new super-heavy element only to have it disproved

460
00:17:43,034 --> 00:17:45,485
我的另一位嘉宾Leonard Hofstadter博士驳回  
by my next guest, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

461
00:17:45,487 --> 00:17:46,619
欢迎来到科学星期五  先生们
Welcome to Science Friday, gentlemen.

462
00:17:46,621 --> 00:17:48,071
-谢谢 -谢谢你
-Thanks. -Thank you.

463
00:17:48,073 --> 00:17:50,707
Ira  请允许我
Ira, if I may, I'd like to apologize

464
00:17:50,709 --> 00:17:52,742
为我上周的行为致歉
for my behavior last week.

465
00:17:52,744 --> 00:17:54,327
这没关系
It's all right.

466
00:17:54,329 --> 00:17:57,714
难道你没有什么对我想说的吗?
Now, isn't there something you'd like to say to me?

467
00:17:58,632 --> 00:18:00,667
没有
No.

468
00:18:01,302 --> 00:18:03,169
好的  Hofstadter博士
Now, Dr. Hofstadter.

469
00:18:03,171 --> 00:18:04,554
能否给我们讲述一下你
Can you walk us through the process

470
00:18:04,556 --> 00:18:06,422
驳回他理论所用的方法呢?
you used to disprove his theory?

471
00:18:06,424 --> 00:18:09,142
-嗯... -我想我可以回答
-Well... -I believe I can answer that.

472
00:18:09,144 --> 00:18:11,094
他问的是我
He asked me.

473
00:18:11,096 --> 00:18:12,312
好吧
Fine.

474
00:18:12,314 --> 00:18:13,346
就像我说的...
As I was saying...

475
00:18:13,348 --> 00:18:14,814
你说的不对 Ira...
You're telling it wrong. Ira...

476
00:18:14,816 --> 00:18:16,816
为了能真正了解事情的始末
to really understand the story here,

477
00:18:16,818 --> 00:18:18,401
你得从头开始
you have to start at the very beginning:

478
00:18:18,403 --> 00:18:21,437
在德克萨斯州东部的小镇里  有一个年轻的天才叫做...
A small town in East Texas, where a young genius named...

479
00:18:21,439 --> 00:18:23,306
-Sheldon... -对的  叫Sheldon Cooper  
-Sheldon... -That's right, Sheldon Cooper.

480
00:18:23,308 --> 00:18:26,576
在他被邻居家的狗咬了之后
He was bitten by his neighbor's dog,

481
00:18:26,578 --> 00:18:28,494
引导了他第一个科学发现
leading to his first scientific breakthrough--

482
00:18:28,496 --> 00:18:30,747
狗狗死亡射线
the doggie death-ray.

483
00:18:30,749 --> 00:18:33,116
可惜的是  他失败了
Which, sadly, he couldn't build

484
00:18:33,118 --> 00:18:35,985
因为圣诞老人没得带给他所需的浓缩铀
because Santa wouldn't bring him enriched uranium.

485
00:18:35,987 --> 00:18:38,755
我的意思是  我比较希望能听Hofstadter博士讲讲
I mean, I'd really like to hear it from Dr. Hofstadter,

486
00:18:38,757 --> 00:18:40,039
如果你不介意
if it's okay with you.

487
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:41,991
真是奇了怪了
What a surprise.

488
00:18:41,993 --> 00:18:44,677
你把我请回来就是为了无视我么?
Did-did you invite me back just so you could ignore me?

489
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:46,512
事实上  我根本没邀请你
Actually, I didn't invite you.

490
00:18:46,514 --> 00:18:47,997
你进来  找了个座
You came in, you took a seat,

491
00:18:47,999 --> 00:18:51,017
而且我对这种对峙感到很不舒服
and I'm not comfortable with confrontation.

492
00:18:52,636 --> 00:18:55,121
Sheldon  这个采访应该是和我有关的
LEONARD: Sheldon, this interview is supposed to be about me.

493
00:18:55,123 --> 00:18:57,323
好吧  这也太无趣了
Well, that seems like a snooze.

494
00:18:57,325 --> 00:19:00,093
甚至对公共广播电台来说
Even for public radio.

495
00:19:00,095 --> 00:19:01,928
你知道吗  如果他们每说一句丢人的话
You know, if we did a shot every time

496
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:03,129
我们都喝一杯
they said something embarrassing,

497
00:19:03,131 --> 00:19:05,281
这绝对会是个翻天覆地的饮酒赛
this would be one hell of a drinking game.

498
00:19:05,283 --> 00:19:07,467
现在喝酒早了点吧  是不是?
A little early for alcohol, isn't it?

499
00:19:07,469 --> 00:19:09,352
你要知道  我不止能发表犀利的科学观点
SHELDON: You know, I don't just say smart things about science.

500
00:19:09,354 --> 00:19:10,853
我还会约德尔唱法
I also yodel.

501
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:16,826
我去拿伏特加
I'll get the vodka.
