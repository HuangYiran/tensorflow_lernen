你好  万圣节愉快
Hello! Happy Halloween!

4

有什么需要帮忙的
How can I help you?

5
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,000
我不喜欢我的甜点
I didn't like my dessert.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,040
噢不是吧
Oh no!

7
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,300
很难吃吗
Was it bad?

8
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,740
超难吃
Painfully bad.

9
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,810
所以就免单吧  行不

10
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,440
嗯

可是  你都吃光光了啊
But, you ate all of it.

12
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,930
而且你还在舔盘子
And you're licking the plate.

13
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,510
我在舔走悲伤
I'm licking the pain away.

14
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,810
悲伤是什么  能吃吗
I don't understand pain.

15
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:53,150
嗷
Ow.

00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,240

我回来了
I'm back.

21
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,200
你去哪了  我还以为你掉厕所里了
Where you been? You were in the bathroom forever.

22
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,790
耶  我想提前练练“不给糖就捣蛋”
Yeah! I decided to start trick or treating early.

23
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:11,660
在女厕所里吗
In the girls' bathroom?

24
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:15,030
是呀  我敲了很多隔间门
Uh-huh! I knocked on the stall doors.

25
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,900
好吧  虽然我很怕问你这个  但是你得到什么了
Okay, I'm a little scared to ask this, but what'd ya get?

26
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,870
半卷卫生纸
I got half a roll of toilet paper.

27
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,810
几根牙线
Some dental floss...

28
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,100
还有一把车钥匙
And car keys.

29
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,720
-车钥匙呢  -卫生间地板上呢
- Where are the car keys? - Oh, on the bathroom floor.

30
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,030
那个大妈扔到我脸上  然后反弹掉了
They bounced off my face after the lady threw 'em at me.

31
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,790
-噢  咱们该回家了  -急什么
- Ooh, we gotta go home! - What's the rush?

32
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,740
我得去给你整套新万圣节装扮
Well, I have to get you a new Halloween costume,

33
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,860
而且咱们一点半还要看孩子呢
and we have a babysitting job at one-thirty.

34
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,590
今天还要看孩子
We're babysitting a kid today?!

35
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:45,020
-是呀  -今天周六啊
- Yeah! - But it's Saturday!

36
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:48,120
而且是万圣节  你知道大家都叫今天什么吗
And it's Halloween! Do you know what they call that?!

37
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,340
万圣周六啊
Saturween!

38
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,260
三年一度的重大日子啊
It only happens like once every three hundred years!

39
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:56,630
不是应该七年一度吗
Shouldn't it happen more like, once every seven years?

40
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,110
噢  现在你倒变聪明了
Oh, so all of a sudden you're smart?

41
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:01,960
咱们只需照看一个小姑娘  从一点半到五点
We only have to babysit one little girl from one-thirty to five,

42
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,840
然后我们就可以享受万圣节美好时光啦
and then we can have all our Halloween fun.

43
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,470
-是万圣周六  -你爱怎么叫就怎么叫吧
- Saturween! - Whatever ween you want!

44
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:10,500
而且既然今天是节日...
And since today's a holiday...

45
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,860
我不想看孩子
I don't want to babysit.

46
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,550
我们要双份报酬
We're getting paid double!

47
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:17,370
这我喜欢
I like this plan.

48
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,670
我绝不会在远处
I'm never that far.

49
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:24,130
无论你在哪儿
No matter where you are.

50
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:27,450
相信吧  我们可以让它成真
Believe it, we can make it come true.

51
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:31,600
我们按自己的方式往下做  不管别人怎么说
We'll do it our way, no matter what they say.

52
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,300
因为自己的事情只能自己做
Because no one's gonna do it for you.

53
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,750
而我  我  我  我
But I, I, I, I...

54
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,430
我永远不会说  永不
I'll never say, never.

55
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:45,570
只要我们在一起
As long as we keep it together.

56
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,000
如果你要实现梦想  也深知梦想的意义
If you're living a dream, and you know what it means.

57
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:54,760
绝对不要让别人改变你的主意
Then you can't let them change your mind.

58
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,850
这就是我们所选择的生活  持续地打破常规
It's the life that we choose, and we still break the rules.

59
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:01,820
但一切都会好起来的
But it's all gonna be just fine.

60
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,670
一切都会好起来的
Yeah, we're all gonna be just fine.

61
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:11,230
我们都会好起来的
You and me we're gonna be just fine.

62
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,360

我讨厌这个装扮  我不能穿这个出去见人
I hate this costume. I can't go out in the world like this.

64
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,140
为啥呀
Why not?

65
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,860
因为我看起来像个傻子
Because I look like an idiot.

66
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:33,340
才不是呢  你看起来和我一样

You are ready for some trickin' and some treatin'.

69
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:43,000
然后人们问我  你扮的是谁啊
And when people ask me "Who are you dressed up as?"

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,520
我该说什么呢
What am I supposed to say?

71
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,400
你就说  你好我是瓦伦汀小猫  试试看
You say, "Hi! I'm Cat Valentine". Try it.

72
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,800
你好 我是瓦伦汀小猫试试看
Hi I'm Cat Valentine try it.

73
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,980
不对  你应该像我一样说
No, you're supposed to say it like me.

74
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,860
好吧...
Okay, uh...

75
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,390

80
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,260
好诡异
This is weird.

81
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:20,170
-我去开门  -那我就追随你
- I'll get the door. - I'll trail after you.

82
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,090

“万一她弄脏了 你们要给她洗澡”
"But if she does become filthy, you must bathe her".

好了  看看我的怀表  是时候离开了
Well, according to my pocket watch, it's time for me to take my leave.

123
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,270
-老爸爱你  -别这样

124
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,520
-老爸爱你  -莎姆你住口
- Daddy loves you. - Sam! Don't.

125
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,540
-来爸爸这边吧  -雅蠛蝶啊
- Come to Daddy. - I don't wanna!

126

好了克拉丽斯  我准备了大南瓜给你雕  另一个给莎姆
Okay Clarice, I got a big pumpkin for you to carve, one for Sam.

127
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,220
我就要...
And for me...

128
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,740
一个长残的小南瓜
A pumpkinette!

129
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,280
-小猫  -啊
- Cat. - Aah!

130
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:16,790
你干什么呢
What are you doing?

131
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:19,960
准备咱们一起和克拉丽斯一起雕南瓜啊
Setting up pumpkins for us to carve with Clarice.

132
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,190
那就是个娃娃 不是真的 你看...
It's a doll. It's not real, see...?

133
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,990
她感觉不到疼
It doesn't feel pain.

134
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,430
啥也闻不到
It can't sniff!

135
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:34,460
所以我们不能和她一起雕南瓜
And we're not carving pumpkins with it.

136
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,260
啊
Ah!

Whoa, Sam! You look just like Cat.

140
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:47,730
我不在意  给我来个泡菜
I don't care and I want a pickle.

141
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:50,330
那么  这位漂亮小精灵...
So, for the pretty genie...

142
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:53,030
是在说我吗
I think that's me.

143
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,250
我给你带了
We got...

144
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,900
-一个精灵瓶  -好耶
- A genie bottle. - Yay!

145
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:02,990
然后为了你能扮的更像精灵...
And to complete your whole "Genie thing" A very old book...

146
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,640
一本咒语书
Of magic spells.

147
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,500
耶
Yay!

148
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,250
这些咒语都是真的吗
Are these spells real?!

149
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,750
呃是啊 当然啦
Oh yeah, sure.

150
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,990
嘿  你应该也给我带点东西来的
Hey, you're supposed to bring me something ya know.

151
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,850
噢对啦  你的糖果
Oh yeah, your candy.

152
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:20,740
噢对啦  我的糖果
Oh yeah, my candy.

153
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,480
什么糖果
What candy?

154
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,000
地球上最酸的糖果
The most sour candy on Planet Earth.

155
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
-超级酸嘴巴  -我以为那是违法的呢
- Super Puckers. - I thought those were illegal.

156
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,930
没错  可是哥上面有人
They are. I know a guy.

157
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,200
呃  我等不及把那糖
Ugh! I can't wait to give

158
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,530
给那帮熊孩子们吃 然后看他们...
that candy out to kids and watch 'em go all...

159
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,930
啊 啊
Ah! Ah!

160
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,710
妈咪  我的嘴
Mommy! My mouth!

161
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:39,260
酸死我啦
It's so sour!

162
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,120
啊
Ah!

163
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:46,150
耶  这就是万圣节精神
Yeah, that's the Halloween spirit.

164
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,350
给我糖 快点
Candy! Now!

165
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:49,120
我落在家里了...我这就去取来
I left it at my place... I'll go grab it!

166
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,400
-等等等一下... -怎么了
- Wait wait wait wait... - What?

167
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,360
你走之前 我能试试上面的咒语吗
Before you go, can I please try a spell on you?

168
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,660
你快放这孩子回去取糖
Will ya let the child go get my candy?

169
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,300
等我念完咒语
After my spell!

170
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:02,930
-快点  -好哒
- Hurry. - Kay-Kay.

171
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:06,370
“唛哩唛哩轰”
"Eeeklawokka, eeka lokka rop-chok"...

172
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:08,590
唛哩轰
Rop-chok?

173
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,670
“给我一个野兽..
"A beast for me...

174
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:14,340
你将会变成野兽”
"A beast you'll be!

175
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,620
嘿哈
Y'chaaaa!"

176
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,770
嘿哈
Y'chaaaa!

177
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:27,080
这本书真垃圾
This book is garbage.

178
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:31,230
-快给老娘去取糖  -去去就回
- Go get my candy. - Back in a sec.

179
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,980
嘿 你确定不和我去“不给糖就捣蛋”吗
Hey, you sure you don't want to go trick or treating with me?

180
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,200
没门
No way.

181
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,210
我要呆在家里  分酸糖给熊孩子们
I'm staying home, passing out Super Puckers,

182
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:41,100
延续我从5岁之后每年万圣节的传统
and doing the same thing I've done every Halloween since I was five years old.

183
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,570
什么
What?

184
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,750
我做一个装满辣椒的大南瓜...
I fill a big pumpkin with chili...

185
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,740
嗯哼
Yeah?

186
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,510
-然后我吃掉辣椒  -啊哈
- Then I eat the chili... - Uh huh?

187
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:52,480
然后我解开裤子看电视
Then I unbutton my pants and watch TV.

188
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,740
哦莎姆  你真坏
Oh Sam. You're so damaged.

189
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:00,290
耶  是戴斯回来了  门开着呢
Oh yeah, Dice is back. It's open!

190
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,460
我说  门开着呢
I say, it's open!

191
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,850
他怎么不进来呢
Why won't he just come in?

192
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:11,870
不晓得  我也困惑了
I dunno, but it's wazzin' me off.

193
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,330
啊
Ah!

194
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:17,130
啊
Ah!

195
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,440
莎姆  我的咒语应验了
Sam! My spell!

196
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,110
我把戴斯变成了一只猴子
I turned Dice into a monkey!

197
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:25,830
是啊  他还带来了我的糖
Yeah, and he brought my candy.

198
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,280
谢啦孩子
Thanks, kid.

199
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,610
莎姆
Sam.

200
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:32,020
等一下猴子戴斯  别跑啊
Wait, monkey-Dice! Don't run away.

201
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,300
莎姆  你看见了吗
Sam, did you see that?!?!

202
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,860
-我看见了一只猴子  -那本来是戴斯
- I saw a monkey. - That was Dice!

203
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,420
胡说
Shut up.

204
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,650
我是认真的  你看
Sam, I'm serious! Look!

205
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,090
我施的这条咒语...
This spell I did...

206
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:46,020
是把人变成野兽的
Was to turn a human person into a beast!

207
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,970
而且猴子算野兽
And a monkey is a beast!

208
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:52,630
有没有一条咒语能帮我妈找到工作的
Is there a spell in there that'll turn my mom into a woman with a job?

209
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,690
我很认真的
This is serious!

210
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,470
你得帮我把猴子戴斯捉住
You have to help me get monkey-Dice

211
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,720
好把他变回男孩
back so I can turn him back into a real boy!

212
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,370
你淡定些好吗
Will you chill your chaz?

213
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,800
世界上没有真正的魔法
There's no such thing as real magic, all right?

214
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,450
你没把戴斯变成猴子  还有
You didn't turn Dice into a monkey. And oh, by the way...

215
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:10,500
娃娃是不会自己就把南瓜刻成南瓜灯的
Little girly dolls cannot just carve pumpkins into jack-o-lan...

216
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,160
-哦  但  -啊
- Oh b... - Ah!

217
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,340
还是不相信呢魔法吗
Still don't believe in real magic?!

218
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,260
不信
No...

219
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,240
但以防万一
But just in case...

220
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,700
还是把刀从她手里拿走吧
I'm taking the knife away from the doll.

221
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,170
是谁刻的南瓜
Who carved that pumpkin?

222
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:51,330
告诉我
Tell me!

223
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,770
我竟然在和娃娃说话
Ah, I'm talking to a doll.

224
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:57,440
我看着像小猫  现在行为都不正常了
I look like Cat and now I'm acting like a ding-bat.

225
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,280
肯定是这身行头弄的
I guess that makes sense.

226
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,310
莎姆  莎姆  我们怎么办
Sam! Sam, what are we gonna do?!

227
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,230
-怎么了  -戴斯  他在我们房间
- About what? - Dice! He's in our room.

228
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:07,690
-他还是只猴子  -小猫
- And he's still a monkey! - Cat...

229
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:08,870
我施了3个变回人类的咒语
I tried three different

230
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,080
没有一个有用
change-back spells and none of them worked.

231
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:13,250
他就坐在你床上
He's back there, just sitting on your bed.

232
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,660
那只猴子不是戴斯  我得告诉你多少次
That monkey isn't Dice! How many times do I...

233
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,460
嗯  他在我床上
Mm! He's on my bed?

234
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,970
嗯
Yeah.

235
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:23,330
它可能在上面干了点坏事
And he might have done something bad on it.

236
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:26,570
它在我床上大便了
That monkey pooped in my bed?!

237
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:30,770
我们就叫它猴子方便了一下吧
Let's just call it "Monkey business".

238
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,940
啊  该死
Ah! Dang it!

239
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,680
万圣节不应该是这样的
This is not how Halloween should be!

240
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,560
我手机呢
Where's my phone?!

241
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:42,280
我在猜莎姆在给谁打电话
I wonder who Sam is calling.

242
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,700
我在给戴斯打  所以你就能和他通话
I'm calling Dice so you can talk to him and he can

243
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,290
这就能解释清他还是个孩子  不是只猴子
explain to you that he's still a kid, not a monkey.

244
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,600
像是戴斯手机的声音
That sounds like Dice's phone.

245
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,000
天呐
Oh my gosh.

246
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:02,500
把娃娃放台子上  跟我来
Put the doll on the counter and come with me.

247
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,860
-我们马上回来  -她是个娃娃  不要和她说话
- We'll be right back. - It's a doll, don't talk to it!

248
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,140
好吧
All right.

249
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,950
为什么这只猴子拿着戴斯的手机
Why is that monkey holding Dice's Pear Phone?

250
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:18,790
这只猴子就是戴斯  我告诉你
That monkey is Dice, I tell ya!

251
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,140
不是
It's not Dice!

252
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:25,090
就是  我把他变成了野兽了
Is so! I turned him into a beast!

253
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:27,060
-等下  别跑  -它为什么变这样了
- Wait, no! - Why's he looking like that?

254
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,270
等下  戴斯  不要跑
Wait! Dice, don't leave!

255
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:33,010
我得把你变回小男孩
I have to turn you back into a young boy!

256
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:36,500
赶紧回来把你的方便产物解决掉啊
Oh, get back here and clean up your monkey business!

257
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:42,710
-什么声音  -快走
- What was that? - Come on!

258
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:47,900
哦  猴子戴斯跑走了
Oh! Monkey-Dice ran away!

259
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,940
不关心  我想知道是谁尖叫了
I don't care. I wanna know who screamed.

260
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,510
啊  电视而已
Ah, it was just the TV.

261
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,760
哦
Oh.

262
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,490
等下
Wait...

263
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:01,610
谁把电视打开的
Who turned on the TV?

264
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,720
哦天呐
Oh my!

265
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,680
-你看见了吗  -不  我的眼睛是闭着的
- You see this? - No, my eyes are closed.

266
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:16,040
-看  -我不想看
- Look. - I don't wanna!

267
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:17,810
-不行  -啊
- Mm! - Ah!

268
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,280
-啊  -啊
- Ah! - Ah!

269
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,920
好了  好了  我想知道
Okay! Okay! I wanna know how

270
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,760
那个娃娃是怎么从那个台子到这个沙发上的
that doll got from that counter to this couch!

271
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,160
还开了电视
And turned on the TV!

272
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,240
还做了微波炉爆米花
And made microwave popcorn!

273
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,530
我都不知道怎么做
Even I don't know how to make microwave popcorn!

274
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:36,510
就是说啊
I know!

275
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,380
-啊  -叮咚
- Ah! - Ding dong!

276
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,310
好了  她爹来了
Good. Her "Father's" Here.

277
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:51,290
快

不知怎么你的声音还在我的耳边

338
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,890
你的双眸还清晰地出现在我的眼前
Those eyes I see them so clear.

339
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:51,910
它们似乎在向我诉说

- Hey man, calm down. - No no, I'm not gonna calm down!

353

Every time I do a concert, that dang doll shows up and it's freaking me out!

354
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,130

啊
Ah!

369
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:21,910
要有多丧心病狂才会在万圣节给孩子葡萄干
What kind of cruel grownup gives a kid raisins on Halloween?

370
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,700
你是个真的男孩
You're... you're a real boy!

371

肯定是我的恢复咒语成功了
One of my change-back spells must've worked!

373

哦
Oh!

377
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:43,170
啊
Uh!

378
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,650
看到了吧  我告诉你了它不是戴斯
See?! I told ya the monkey wasn't Dice,

379
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:47,910
而且根本没有魔法这回事
and that there's no such thing as magic.

380
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:48,820
啊哈
Uh-huh.

381
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,850

我姑姑的帮手猴
My Aunt Ferjeen's helper monkey.

384
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,540
它都帮她干什么
What does the monkey help her do?

385
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:02,090
-吃饭  穿衣  洗澡  -不需再说
- Eat, get dressed, wash. - I've heard enough.

386
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:05,490
但你怎么把你姑姑的帮手带来了呢
But, why'd you send your Aunt's helper monkey here?

387
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,090
来给莎姆带糖来啊
To bring Sam her candy.

388
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:09,970
但  它怎么会有你的手机呢
But... but why does he have your cell phone?

389
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:12,770
什么  是我的手机吗
What?! That's my cell phone...

390
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:15,760
我以为我弄丢了
I thought I lost it!

391
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,840
法兹  赶快把我的手机给我
Futz, you gimme my phone right now!

392
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,940
噢

393
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:26,910
他把我的电话本都删除了
He deleted all my contacts!

394
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:28,740
法兹
Futz!

395
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,780

Let's go.

396
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:34,320
你要帮我重新输入所有联系人
You are gonna help me re-input every one of my contacts.

397
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,890
我以为我会魔法了呢
I thought I did magic.

398
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:40,510
抱歉了  孩子
Sorry, kid.

399
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:44,170
此生无魔法
Ain't no magic in this life.

400

我刚看到一个男孩背着一个猴子
I just saw a monkey riding on a boy's back.

402
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:56,610
让我想起了我的童年
It reminded me of my childhood.

403
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:00,040
我猜您可能没结婚吧
I'm guessing there's no Mrs. Drange.

404
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:03,290
克莱里斯在这儿啊

-悠着点  -这是个娃娃
- Easy. - That is a doll!

408
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:15,570
她听不见你说话  也不会回答你的
She can't hear you and she can't talk back!

409
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:17,680
就别假装她是你的女儿
So quit pretending she's your

410

我看我们不受欢迎了
I can see we're not welcome here.

413
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:31,240
我的怀表已经过了睡觉时间了
And my pocket watch tells me it's past our bedtime.

414
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,180
