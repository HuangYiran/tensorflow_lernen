蕴藏于这里的那些神秘莫测

我们称这个地方为"宇宙"
a place we call the universe.

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,822
我们的太阳是否有一颗邪恶伴星呢
Could our Sun have an evil companion?

9
00:00:23,823 --> 00:00:25,984
是否有这样一颗未被发现的死星
An undiscovered death star

10
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:29,026
在最遥远的太阳系边界处旋转  徘徊
rotating at the furthest edges of the Solar System?

11
00:00:30,558 --> 00:00:33,530
这颗神秘的恒星是否每隔一段时间
Does this mysterious star scatter destruction

12
00:00:33,531 --> 00:00:36,083
就为太阳系埋带来毁灭性的灾难
through the Solar System at regular intervals,

13
00:00:36,483 --> 00:00:40,326
它是否造成了地球史上最大规模的灭绝呢
accounting for the greatest extinctions in Earth's history?

14
00:00:41,397 --> 00:00:44,329
科学家敏锐的目光穿过这个充斥着巨恒星
Sifting through a realm populated by giant worlds

and mysterious planetoids, scientists are on the hunt

16
00:00:49,164 --> 00:00:53,297
太阳的邪恶双子星  涅墨西斯

太阳的邪恶双子星 :涅墨西斯

19

我们头顶上闪烁的数以亿万计的群星之中
Of the billions of stars twinkling overhead,

20
00:01:10,081 --> 00:01:13,393
有一颗也许会使地球上生灵涂炭
one may be a scourge to life on Earth...

21
00:01:13,624 --> 00:01:17,797
它就是太阳的邪恶双子星  涅墨西斯
An evil twin to the Sun named Nemesis.

22
00:01:20,639 --> 00:01:23,161
有些科学家怀疑  涅墨西斯是一颗
Some scientists suspect that Nemesis is

23
00:01:23,161 --> 00:01:27,254
不发光且尚未发现的围绕太阳转动的恒星
a dark, still-undiscovered star orbiting our Sun.

24
00:01:28,085 --> 00:01:30,857
而每过两千六百万年
And every 26 million years,

25
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:33,900
它就会带来一场灾难
it triggers a disaster.

and so these successive passages of the Sun's companion

30
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:45,890
将会把一些彗星带入太阳系的内部
would send comets into the inner Solar System.

31
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,951
它们有可能撞击地球
Some of them will hit Earth.

32
00:01:49,933 --> 00:01:53,365
而一旦撞击发生  地球将生灵涂炭
What follows is death on a colossal scale.

令地球大部分物种灭绝的灾难
went extinct 65 million years ago

45
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:22,770
是由于一颗彗星撞击地球而造成的
was because a comet slammed into the Earth.

46
00:02:29,576 --> 00:02:32,218
但天文学家理查德・穆勒却提出了
But astronomer Richard Muller has proposed

47
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:36,151
一套革命性的理论  以解释为何彗星
a revolutionary theory to explain why that space rock

48
00:02:36,151 --> 00:02:38,983
会恰巧在那一时刻撞击地球
crashed to Earth at that particular moment.

49
00:02:40,525 --> 00:02:43,177
涅墨西斯理论描述了这一假想
The Nemesis theory postulates that

50
00:02:42,056 --> 00:02:46,799
理查德・穆勒
美国劳伦斯伯克利国家实验室

51
00:02:43,177 --> 00:02:45,198
即  有一颗恒星在做绕日运动
there's a star orbiting the Sun

52
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:48,090
而其公转周期为两千六百万年
at a 26-million-year period.

53
00:02:48,722 --> 00:02:51,003
足矣
That's about it.

54
00:02:51,374 --> 00:02:55,016
几乎不需要其它假说来支持此理论了
Almost no other assumptions need to be made.

55
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:59,991
穆勒认为当涅墨西斯运行到太阳附近时
Muller believes that as Nemesis nears the Sun,

56
00:02:59,991 --> 00:03:01,942
它所带来的引力扰乱
its gravitational disturbance

57
00:03:01,943 --> 00:03:04,905
会使得一些彗星穿越太阳系
sends comets flying through the Solar System.

58
00:03:08,048 --> 00:03:10,389
这种现象的后果就是造成地球历史上
The resulting impacts have been the source of

59
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,622
多次大规模物种灭绝现象的元凶
many major extinction events in Earth's history.

60
00:03:15,524 --> 00:03:18,736
穆勒这样解释他的理论是如何诞生的
Muller explains how the theory came about.

61
00:03:20,288 --> 00:03:21,819
有两位古生物学者
Two paleontologists,

62
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:23,730
在研究地球生物灭绝的规律时
when looking at patterns of extinctions,

63
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,772
发现了一件似乎十分不可思议的事情
came across something that seemed utterly insane.

64
00:03:27,023 --> 00:03:30,285
他们说  这种类似的灭绝现象
They said that similar extinctions were taking place

65
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:34,619
大约每两千六百万年就要发生一次
every 26 million years on a regular schedule.

66
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:39,683
任何地球本身的现象都似乎都无法解释
The discovery of a 26-million-year pattern of extinctions

67
00:03:40,404 --> 00:03:46,398
这个每两千六百万年的物种灭绝规律
seemed impossible to explain by any process native to the Earth itself.

68
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,351
这可是科学家们梦寐以求的事情
This is the sort of thing you dream about in science.

69
00:03:49,351 --> 00:03:51,933
因为这说明有些事物对我们还是未知
It means there's something we don't understand.

70
00:03:51,934 --> 00:03:53,625
说明有未知的事物亟待发现
It means there's a discovery waiting.

71
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:56,987
于是  我便试图去探求那未解之谜
So I set about trying to figure out what that was.

72
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,942
穆勒提出了一个惊人的假说
Muller made an astonishing proposal.

73
00:04:03,383 --> 00:04:06,615
这些周期性灭绝现象的唯一合理解释就是
The only logical cause of these periodic extinctions

74
00:04:06,616 --> 00:04:11,309
有一颗潜恒星  它每两千六百万年饶太阳一周
is a cosmic stalker that orbits our Sun every 26 million years,

75
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,182
而每一接近太阳就会造成彗星轨道的紊乱
disturbing the comets on each approach.

76
00:04:14,182 --> 00:04:18,205
总之  它是一颗太阳的死亡伴星
In short, a death star companion to our Sun.

77
00:04:20,457 --> 00:04:24,550
如果真的发现这颗恒星  将是意义深远的
If this star is discovered, it is so important.

78
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:30,515
它在地球上生物进化过程中起到了重要作用
It was a major player in the evolution of life on Earth.

79
00:04:30,956 --> 00:04:34,959
若不是这颗恒星  也许恐龙还在称霸地球
Without this, perhaps the dinosaurs would still be here.

80
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,241
如果穆勒所言属实
If Muller is right,

81
00:04:37,241 --> 00:04:40,443
那么人类之所以能够出现在地球上
humanity itself could owe its existence

82
00:04:40,443 --> 00:04:42,724
还是多亏了这颗名叫涅墨西斯的死星
to the Nemesis death star.

83
00:04:43,766 --> 00:04:48,680
毕竟每次大规模灭绝都清除了大量物种
After all, each mass extinction wiped out vast numbers of species,

84
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,453
但这也为新物种的出现和繁衍开辟了道路
but each also cleared the way for new species to arise,

85
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:56,366
其中就包括  最后出现的人类
including, ultimately, humans.

86
00:04:59,469 --> 00:05:02,661
通过在加州的圣塔罗莎高原的可控火灾
We can witness the way Nemesis would have altered evolution on Earth

87
00:05:02,662 --> 00:05:07,856
我们便知道涅墨西斯是如何影响地球生物进化的
by looking at a controlled burn on the Santa rosa plateau in California.

88
00:05:10,378 --> 00:05:13,800
灭顶之灾不时降临在地球上
So every now and again, some cataclysmic event happens

89
00:05:12,069 --> 00:05:16,782
克利福德・强森
南加州大学

90
00:05:13,801 --> 00:05:17,383
并将地球上的大量物种一扫而空
that wipes out a huge number of species here on Earth.

91
00:05:17,654 --> 00:05:20,756
就像这些可控火灾一样
And this is just like happens with these controlled burns,

92
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:23,799
当大火清除了一些物种
where the burn wipes out a number of species,

93
00:05:23,799 --> 00:05:27,001
同时也为新的生命提供了生存的空间
which then makes room for new things to take hold.

94
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:33,637
我看到火焰在我们身后迅速蔓延
So I'm seeing a fire raging behind us.

95
00:05:33,637 --> 00:05:34,727
你们在做什么
What's going on there?

96
00:05:34,728 --> 00:05:36,229
为什么要放火呢
Why do you light fires?

97
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,461
我们在这里放火
We're out here setting this fire

98
00:05:38,461 --> 00:05:40,792
是为了将这一片植被清理干净
to clear part of this vegetation away,

99
00:05:40,793 --> 00:05:44,095
为了将外来的植物清除
to get rid of the non-native species of plants

100
00:05:44,096 --> 00:05:46,828
好让本地植物得以从新回归
that are growing here so the native can grow back.

101
00:05:47,238 --> 00:05:49,009
每年我们都会来到这里
We come here and burn annually

102
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,812
焚烧不同区域  以便进行分析比较
in different plots of land so that it can be studied,

103
00:05:51,812 --> 00:05:55,444
我们还能够借此了解其对于环境的影响
and we can also see the impact it's having on that environment.

104
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:02,670
这次计划烧除展示了
A prescribed fire mimics the kinds of

105
00:06:02,671 --> 00:06:06,404
涅墨西斯所能带来的大规模物种灭绝现象
mass extinctions that Nemesis may have caused.

106
00:06:08,095 --> 00:06:10,446
很多物种就此消失
Many species are swept away,

107
00:06:10,447 --> 00:06:16,121
但幸存物种则有空间得以繁衍  不断进化
but the destruction leaves room for the survivors to flourish and evolve...

108
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:19,954
譬如说  当恐龙突然灭绝后
Just as mammals survived and thrived

109
00:06:19,955 --> 00:06:23,227
哺乳动物幸存下来且日益壮大
after the fiery death of the dinosaurs,

110
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:27,401
从而为人类的进化奠定了基础
setting the stage for human evolution.

111
00:06:31,294 --> 00:06:35,167
每年在圣塔罗莎都有计划烧除
These prescribed fires return to Santa rosa every year

112
00:06:35,438 --> 00:06:38,360
这种现象仿效了
and imitate the driving motivation

113
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,002
涅墨西斯理论的提出诱因
behind the creation of the Nemesis hypothesis--

114
00:06:41,002 --> 00:06:44,735
即灭绝是不断发生的
that extinctions occur over and over.

115
00:06:44,956 --> 00:06:48,689
对于这些有规律的物种灭绝
There are really only two viable explanations

116
00:06:48,689 --> 00:06:51,151
只有两种合理的解释
for the regularity of the extinctions.

117
00:06:51,341 --> 00:06:53,302
其中一种就是涅墨西斯理论
One of them is the Nemesis theory.

118
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:56,955
而另一种解释就是机缘巧合
The other is that by the throw of the dice

119
00:06:56,956 --> 00:06:59,027
那些灭顶之灾只不过是
they just accidentally happen to

120
00:06:59,027 --> 00:07:01,168
恰巧每两千六百万年发生一次
line up every 26 million years.

121
00:07:03,451 --> 00:07:06,673
但涅墨西斯究竟是如何做到如此精准地
But how, exactly, would Nemesis trigger extinctions

122
00:07:06,674 --> 00:07:09,666
有规律地造成"计划烧除"呢
with the regularity of a prescribed burn?

123
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:14,309
在太阳系中一个名为奥尔特云的区域
The possible answer lies in a region of the Solar System

124
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,912
也许能找到我们想要的答案
known as the Oort Cloud.

125
00:07:22,146 --> 00:07:27,009
奥尔特云是大量彗星的"冷藏室"
The Oort Cloud is the place where comets are kept in cold storage

126
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:29,942
直到它们有一天向着太阳呼啸而过
until they come screaming in towards the Sun.

127
00:07:30,423 --> 00:07:32,494
就是说  那些彗星都冷冻在奥尔特云中
So these things are sitting in deep freeze,

128
00:07:33,325 --> 00:07:36,797
它们大概位于为我们与最近恒星的中间
sort of at the distance halfway between us and the nearest stars.

129
00:07:41,812 --> 00:07:44,213
奥尔特云中的大多数彗星
The vast majority of Oort Cloud comets

130
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:48,107
都在距离太阳远达一光年的安全距离环绕
orbit at the safe distance of up to one light year from the Sun.

131
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:53,731
除非有什么东西打乱了它们的轨道
That is, unless something disturbs their orbits.

132
00:07:55,564 --> 00:07:57,175
有时  一颗恒星运行到奥尔特云处
Occasionally, a star will come by,

133
00:07:57,175 --> 00:07:58,786
便会稍微推撞一下这些彗星
and they get a little bit jostled.

134
00:07:58,786 --> 00:08:01,238
但是这轻微的推撞却意义重大
And a little jostling can do a lot of things.

135
00:08:01,238 --> 00:08:04,280
它能让彗星完全脱离太阳引力
It can make them go away and leave the Sun entirely.

136
00:08:04,281 --> 00:08:06,462
或轻微改变它们的运行的轨道
It can put them on a slightly different orbit.

137
00:08:06,463 --> 00:08:09,255
还有一个可能  就是使他们慢慢
But one of the things it can do is put them on an orbit that

138
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:12,107
改变到朝太阳运行的轨道中
slowly falls in toward the Sun.

139
00:08:16,611 --> 00:08:18,992
通过观察杂耍者的动作
By following the motions of a juggler,

140
00:08:18,993 --> 00:08:21,725
天文学家格雷格・劳克林可以直观的看出
astronomer Greg Laughlin can help visualize

141
00:08:21,725 --> 00:08:24,597
为什么类似于涅墨西斯的恒星经过
why cometary orbits are so vulnerable to the effects

142
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:27,480
会很容易影响彗星轨道
of a passing star like Nemesis.

143
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:28,360
嗨  格雷格
Hey, Greg.

144
00:08:28,361 --> 00:08:32,694
这是乔希・霍顿  我们需要乔希的帮助
This is Josh Horton, and we've enlisted Josh to

145
00:08:32,694 --> 00:08:36,126
以便于了解楚奥尔特云到底是怎么运作的
kind of help us understand how the Oort Cloud really works.

146
00:08:36,357 --> 00:08:39,259
你一次能让多少球保持在空中
How many balls are you actually able to keep up in the air at one time?

147
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:39,940
七个
That was seven.

148
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,821
我也能玩八个或者九个
I can do a little bit of eight and nine,

149
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:44,023
不过一般练习时我都用七个球
but seven is what I practice the most.

150
00:08:45,415 --> 00:08:48,637
杂耍者向空中抛东西时的弧线
The arc of something that a juggler is tossing up is very

151
00:08:48,637 --> 00:08:52,289
和彗星在它的偏心轨道上的轨迹非常相似
much like the arc that a comet makes on its eccentric orbit.

152
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,481
特别是因为球在接近最高点时减速
Especially because it's going slow near the top,

153
00:08:54,482 --> 00:08:56,593
接近最低点的时候加速
and it's going very quickly near the bottom.

154
00:08:58,565 --> 00:09:00,826
如果我们想要模仿整个的奥尔特云
If we want to simulate the whole Oort Cloud,

155
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:02,698
我们必须同时让多个球运动
then we've gotta keep a lot of balls in motion.

156
00:09:02,699 --> 00:09:05,191
所以我在想你能不能教教我
So I'm wondering if you can maybe give me a quick--

157
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:07,212
好的  我可以试一下
Yeah. Yeah, I can try.

158
00:09:07,483 --> 00:09:08,894
从两个开始好了
Well, let's start with two.

159
00:09:08,894 --> 00:09:10,054
两个球
Two balls.

160
00:09:10,966 --> 00:09:11,786
你需要做的是
What you're gonna do here

161
00:09:11,786 --> 00:09:14,748
使两个球在空中交叉
is you're gonna cross both balls in the air.

162
00:09:14,749 --> 00:09:15,769
开始扔吧  不对
So it's gonna be throw-- No.

163
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:19,122
两个球的轨迹要相同  和彗星轨道一样
The throws are exactly the same, just like the path of a comet.

164
00:09:19,122 --> 00:09:21,403
看着  交叉  交叉
So...Cross, cross.

165
00:09:22,715 --> 00:09:24,056
它们在空中划出了一个"X"
They're making an "X" In the air.

166
00:09:24,056 --> 00:09:25,817
-它们要同时被扔出去吗  -不对
- Do they leave at the same time or-- - No,

167
00:09:25,818 --> 00:09:28,570
先扔右  再左  接住  接住
It's right, left, catch, catch.

168
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,581
-右  左  -差不多是这样
- Right, left-- - No that was it.

169
00:09:30,582 --> 00:09:31,943
再把你左手那个扔高点就好了
Just throw your left hand a little bit higher.

170
00:09:31,943 --> 00:09:33,113
右  左  接  接
Right, left, catch, catch.

171
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,045
不错  你差不多是同时接住它们的
Good. You're kind of catching 'em at the same time.

172
00:09:35,045 --> 00:09:36,446
右  左  接  接
Right, left, catch, catch.

173
00:09:36,447 --> 00:09:37,277
好一点了
That was better.

174
00:09:37,938 --> 00:09:40,460
我就像是一个太阳系
So I'm a little bit like a Solar System where there's some

175
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:43,802
有着严重的重力不稳定性
serious gravitational instability in the mix.

176
00:09:46,695 --> 00:09:49,887
乔希同时保持七个球在空中
So Josh is keeping seven balls in the air at the same time,

177
00:09:49,888 --> 00:09:53,841
这和太阳的工作有些相似  太阳是同时保持
and that's not unlike the Sun's job, which is to keep trillions

178
00:09:53,841 --> 00:09:57,363
数万亿的彗星同时运行在奥尔特云的轨道上
of comets all orbiting in the Oort Cloud.

179
00:10:02,238 --> 00:10:04,820
但是根据太阳伴星假说
But according to the Nemesis hypothesis,

180
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:08,422
每2600万年  太阳的这个微妙的"把戏"
the Sun's delicate juggling act is disrupted

181
00:10:08,743 --> 00:10:13,286
就会被它的邪恶双子星干扰一次
by its evil stellar twin every 26 million years.

182
00:10:14,117 --> 00:10:18,430
就像恐怖电影中的鬼怪  这个邪恶双子星
And like something out of a horror movie, this evil twin

183
00:10:19,001 --> 00:10:21,453
是极难察觉到的
could be nearly invisible.

184
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:31,141
我们的太阳真的有一颗邪恶双子星吗
Does our Sun have an evil twin?

185
00:10:31,442 --> 00:10:33,113
一颗名为涅墨西斯的恒星
A star named "Nemesis"

186
00:10:33,113 --> 00:10:36,245
是否在远离我们太阳系的轨道上运行着
orbiting the distant reaches of our Solar System?

187
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:40,449
是否每2600万年  它会从奥尔特云向地球
And every 26 million years, does it fling comets

188
00:10:40,449 --> 00:10:42,560
抛掷彗星吗
from the Oort Cloud toward Earth?

189
00:10:44,272 --> 00:10:46,734
有时候它们会被抛出  有时它们也会
Sometimes they get tossed out, other times they orbit

190
00:10:46,734 --> 00:10:49,356
无攻击性的运转直到它们消逝
harmlessly until they evaporate and go away.

191
00:10:49,356 --> 00:10:53,189
如果有彗星群穿越太阳系
If you have comets rattling through the inner Solar System,

192
00:10:49,817 --> 00:10:54,480
格雷格・劳克林
加利福尼亚大学圣塔克鲁兹分校

193
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:55,451
那么就可以说  一切预测都不准了
then, in a sense, all bets are off.

194
00:10:56,272 --> 00:10:58,854
科学家理查德・穆勒不仅仅提出理论认为
Scientist Richard Muller not only theorizes

195
00:10:58,854 --> 00:11:02,927
这种周期性混乱是受一颗太阳的致命伴星影响
that this periodic mayhem is caused by a deadly companion star to the Sun,

196
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:08,902
他还确切的了解它是什么恒星  红矮星
he believes he knows precisely what kind of star it is-- A red dwarf.

197
00:11:09,523 --> 00:11:11,554
有一个恒星以2600万年为周期
That there is a star orbiting the Sun

198
00:11:11,555 --> 00:11:14,587
围绕太阳运转  这是我的想法
in a 26-million-year period, that was my idea.

199
00:11:15,818 --> 00:11:19,721
我们假设这颗恒星是红矮星
Let's assume the star is a red dwarf star.

200
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:20,962
理查德・穆勒
美国劳伦斯伯克利国家实验室

201
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:20,651
为什么是红矮星呢
Why a red dwarf?

202
00:11:20,652 --> 00:11:24,094
因为这是银河系里最常见的恒星
Because that's the most populist star in the galaxy.

203
00:11:28,849 --> 00:11:31,140
红矮星是一颗很小的恒星
A red dwarf is a tiny star

204
00:11:31,141 --> 00:11:35,074
总重量还不及太阳的十分之一
that weighs in with a mass less than 1/10 of our Sun.

205
00:11:35,334 --> 00:11:38,156
但是正如天文学家格雷格・劳克林所展示的
But as astronomer Greg Laughlin demonstrates,

206
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:41,319
它的影响就像是在杂耍者抛掷火焰时
it can have the effect of a 9-pod bowling ball

207
00:11:41,319 --> 00:11:44,651
再接住一个八斤重的保龄球
tossed into the arms of a juggler playing with fire.

208
00:11:46,413 --> 00:11:49,355
奥尔特云本身是个很无聊的地方
All by itself, the Oort Cloud is a pretty boring place,

209
00:11:49,356 --> 00:11:51,747
所以我们打算来点刺激的
and so we're gonna have to up the ante a little bit.

210
00:11:53,939 --> 00:11:58,152
这些就代表奥尔特云里的彗星
These are gonna represent the comets in the Oort Cloud.

211
00:12:00,935 --> 00:12:01,635
准备好了吗
Are you ready?

212
00:12:01,636 --> 00:12:03,437
我最好要往后退一点
I think I'm gonna step back a little bit.

213
00:12:10,253 --> 00:12:12,805
乔希让火炬顺利的运动
So Josh has got them all going nicely,

214
00:12:12,805 --> 00:12:15,747
就像是彗星在奥尔特云里运转一样
just like the comets orbiting in the Oort Cloud.

215
00:12:16,598 --> 00:12:19,920
我们来看看如果我把这个红矮星
So let's see what would happen if I took this red dwarf and

216
00:12:19,921 --> 00:12:22,152
扔进太阳系时会发生什么
tossed it into the Solar System.

217
00:12:22,153 --> 00:12:24,534
-乔希  你准备好接红矮星了吗  -好了
- Josh, are you ready for the red dwarf? - Yeah.

218
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:25,705
开始吧
Here we go.

219
00:12:29,969 --> 00:12:33,762
你可以看见  红矮星闯进太阳系
So as you can see, the red dwarf coming through the solar system

220
00:12:34,283 --> 00:12:38,056
确实改变了彗星群的轨道
has really changed the orbits of the comets.

221
00:12:38,856 --> 00:12:41,698
注意  事实上这两个彗星是落向地球了
Notice that two of these comets actually crashed onto the earth.

222
00:12:41,699 --> 00:12:45,442
这和彗星撞击发生时情况类似
That's not unlike what happens when a giant impact occurs,

223
00:12:45,752 --> 00:12:47,913
大规模物种灭绝就会降临到我们头上
and we get one of these mass extinctions.

224
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:56,220
地球所经历的一系列冲击
For many people the idea that Earth has been

225
00:12:56,221 --> 00:12:58,452
是由一颗环绕太阳的灾星引发的理论
the victim of a series of impacts caused by

226
00:12:58,452 --> 00:13:01,784
对于大多数人来说都不太可信
an orbiting death star seems unlikely.

227
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:05,868
毕竟当我们望向天空时
After all, when we look at the sky,

228
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:08,019
我们只能看见一个太阳
we only see one sun.

229
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:13,064
但事实上  大部分恒星都是成对出现的
But in fact, the majority of stars come in pairs.

230
00:13:14,436 --> 00:13:18,899
大概有60%或者70%的恒星实际上是
Probably something like 60%, 70% of stars may indeed be

231
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:22,882
二元的  或者星系中有两颗以上的恒星
binary, or have even higher numbers of stars in the system.

232
00:13:27,987 --> 00:13:30,879
根据理查德・穆勒的太阳伴星假说
According to Richard Muller's Nemesis hypothesis,

233
00:13:31,169 --> 00:13:34,591
我们的太阳是二元恒星系统的一部分
our Sun is part of such a binary star system.

234
00:13:36,324 --> 00:13:37,645
一切都说得通
It all works.

235
00:13:37,645 --> 00:13:41,708
你需要做的就是假设太阳和
All you have to do is hypothesize that the Sun,

236
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:45,140
银河系里其它三分之二的恒星一样
like 2/3 of all the other stars in the galaxy,

237
00:13:45,141 --> 00:13:46,432
有一个伴星
has a companion--

238
00:13:46,432 --> 00:13:50,205
它2600万年的公转周期  然后就明白了
This one with a 26-million-year period-- And there you have it.

239
00:13:51,386 --> 00:13:52,336
若真为此
But if so,

240
00:13:52,337 --> 00:13:55,199
为什么我们在天上看不见太阳的双子星呢
why don't we see the Sun's twin in the sky?

241
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:58,672
穆勒说  原因很简单
According to Muller, the reason is simple.

242
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:02,595
涅墨西斯是一颗极其黯淡的红矮星
Nemesis is an extremely dim red dwarf.

243
00:14:03,406 --> 00:14:05,737
当我第一次提出涅墨西斯这个理论时
When I first came up with the Nemesis theory, the issue was,

244
00:14:05,738 --> 00:14:07,589
问题在于"等等  那为什么没人发现它呢"
"Well, wait a minute, how come nobody found it?"

245
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,511
答案很显然
And that was pretty obvious.

246
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:12,973
它肯定很难被观测到
It has to be hard to find.

247
00:14:15,366 --> 00:14:19,459
据定义  红矮星基本不会发光
By definition, a red dwarf barely glows at all.

248
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,051
它可能是离我们的太阳最近的一颗恒星
It would be the closest star to our Sun,

249
00:14:23,052 --> 00:14:24,603
可是我们居然不知道它的存在
and we wouldn't even know it.

250
00:14:24,603 --> 00:14:25,964
为什么呢
Now, why is that?

251
00:14:26,134 --> 00:14:29,336
我们发现临近恒星的方法无非是因为
The way we discover nearby stars is either because

252
00:14:29,337 --> 00:14:33,490
它们很耀眼  可是红矮星一点也不明亮
they're very bright-- And the red dwarf star is not very bright--

253
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:35,942
或是因为太阳会经过它
Or because the Sun is moving past it.

254
00:14:36,533 --> 00:14:38,094
这颗恒星和我们一起移动
This star is moving with us.

255
00:14:38,094 --> 00:14:39,114
是的  它围绕我们运转
Yes, it's orbiting us,

256
00:14:39,115 --> 00:14:41,406
但是运转的速度很慢--要2600万年
but that orbit is very slow-- 26-million years.

257
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,668
所以基本上是和地球同步
So it'd be moving with us.

258
00:14:42,668 --> 00:14:46,120
它看上去就像固定在天空中一动不动
It would just be at a fixed position in the sky, and wouldn't move.

259
00:14:46,891 --> 00:14:49,322
换句话说  当从地球上看过去时
In other words, when viewed from Earth,

260
00:14:49,323 --> 00:14:52,825
大部分附近的恒星都在时刻移动中
most nearby objects are shifting over time.

261
00:14:53,307 --> 00:14:55,939
但是涅墨西斯却一直不动
But Nemesis is sitting still.

262
00:14:59,462 --> 00:15:02,504
因此  寻找涅墨西斯逐渐成为热点
So as the search for Nemesis enters high gear,

263
00:15:02,704 --> 00:15:06,266
关键问题在于  何处寻芳踪
one key question is where to look.

264
00:15:07,739 --> 00:15:12,052
所幸科学家们了解双子星的运行方式
Luckily, scientists understand how binary stars orbit each other,

265
00:15:12,853 --> 00:15:16,616
这方法恰可用于寻找涅墨西斯
and they can apply this knowledge to the search for Nemesis.

266
00:15:18,347 --> 00:15:21,909
如果太阳和涅墨西斯质量相当
If both the Sun and Nemesis were of equal mass,

267
00:15:22,441 --> 00:15:25,663
那它们的绕转轨道必是一个巨大的正圆形
they would orbit each other in a vast but equal circle,

268
00:15:25,934 --> 00:15:29,246
寻找涅墨西斯的难度便相对较小
and the search for Nemesis would be relatively easy.

269
00:15:30,357 --> 00:15:34,330
但质量相当的双子星十分罕见
But binary stars are rarely equally sized.

270
00:15:35,672 --> 00:15:39,525
仅有10% 或 20%的双子星
10% or 20% of binary stars have two components

271
00:15:39,525 --> 00:15:41,926
两颗恒星大小完全相当
where the stars are really on an equal footing.

272
00:15:42,097 --> 00:15:44,989
绝大多数情况下  其中的一个
And then there are also a large number of stars where one star

273
00:15:44,989 --> 00:15:47,431
要比另一颗恒星质量更大
is considerably more massive than the other.

274
00:15:50,904 --> 00:15:53,676
若双子星质量大小不等
When binary stars are of different sizes,

275
00:15:53,937 --> 00:15:57,359
较小的一个  即涅墨西斯
the smaller star, in this case Nemesis,

276
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,393
多以椭圆形轨道围绕质量大的恒星
swings in a wide orbit around its larger companion,

277
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:03,154
也就是太阳
in this case the Sun,

278
00:16:03,424 --> 00:16:06,036
太阳基本上看不出来是在运行
which barely seems to orbit at all.

279
00:16:06,317 --> 00:16:10,160
那么  较小的为何在较远轨道上运行呢
Why does the smaller one move in a much wider circle?

280
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,064
这可以用"质心"的概念来解释
The answer has to do with a concept called the "Center of mass."

281
00:16:15,814 --> 00:16:18,175
我们请一对体操运动员在平衡木上
A pair of gymnasts on a balance beam

282
00:16:18,176 --> 00:16:21,088
为各位做直观的阐释
can help us visualize how it works.

283
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:26,733
一对双子星绕着它们的质心运行
Stars in a binary pair orbit around their common center of mass.

284
00:16:23,221 --> 00:16:27,534
劳拉・丹利
格里菲斯天文台

285
00:16:26,733 --> 00:16:29,004
如果二星质量相当
If two stars are about the same mass,

286
00:16:29,015 --> 00:16:32,748
它们将围绕中间不可见的点运行
they orbit around an invisible spot in the middle,

287
00:16:33,129 --> 00:16:34,390
该点恰好位于二者正中
right in between the two of them,

288
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:39,254
就像平衡木上的塔米和卡莉
just like Tami and Carly are balanced on this seesaw.

289
00:16:41,496 --> 00:16:42,556
你们能保持平衡吗
Wow, you guys are balanced?

290
00:16:42,556 --> 00:16:44,117
但与两位运动员不同
But unlike these gymnasts,

291
00:16:44,118 --> 00:16:47,070
涅墨西斯和太阳质量不等
Nemesis and the Sun are not equal.

292
00:16:48,001 --> 00:16:49,842
天文学家理查德・穆勒估算
Astronomer Richard Muller estimates that

293
00:16:50,073 --> 00:16:54,536
太阳的质量是其未知双子星的十倍
the Sun has ten times more mass than its undiscovered twin.

294
00:16:55,227 --> 00:16:58,619
若双子星中的一颗质量大于其"兄弟"
And when one binary star is larger than its sibling,

295
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:03,683
二者的质心将移向较大的一颗
the center of mass between them shifts closer to the larger star.

296
00:17:05,645 --> 00:17:07,946
现在塔米将为我们演示这一理论
So Tami's going to help illustrate that.

297
00:17:07,947 --> 00:17:09,328
塔米  你大概有多重呢
Tami, how much do you weigh?

298
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,669
-大概59公斤  -哦  59公斤
- About 130.  - About 130?

299
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:14,472
在这头  我们放一块约16千克的重物
And we have weights at this end that are about 35 pounds.

300
00:17:14,473 --> 00:17:18,546
这样  你比重物质量的四倍略微轻一点
So you're just a little bit less than four times that weight.

301
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:19,666
上来
So climb on up.

302
00:17:19,667 --> 00:17:23,129
看看你站在哪  才能维持平衡木的平衡
Let's see where you have to be to balance the balance beam.

303
00:17:25,922 --> 00:17:29,494
鉴于塔米大约是金属重物的四倍重
Since Tami weighs about four times as much as the metal weights,

304
00:17:30,526 --> 00:17:34,979
她必须大幅度移向质心以保持平衡
she must move far closer to the center of mass to maintain balance.

305
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:39,612
如果塔米和重物代表双子星
If Tami and the weights represented binary stars,

306
00:17:39,613 --> 00:17:41,614
较轻的重物将在较远的轨道上运行
the weights would orbit far out in the distance

307
00:17:42,015 --> 00:17:44,497
而塔米则近于一动不动
while tami would barely move.

308
00:17:45,288 --> 00:17:48,380
事实上  二者是相互围绕运行的
In fact, both would be orbiting each other.

309
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,523
人们常误以为较重的恒星多原地不动
It's kind of a misconception to think that the more massive

310
00:17:52,524 --> 00:17:56,046
而较轻的都以它为中心绕转
star doesn't move, and the less massive star just goes around it.

311
00:17:56,047 --> 00:18:00,820
事实上  它们仍是绕着共同的质心运行
In fact, they're still both orbiting the common center of mass.

312
00:18:02,172 --> 00:18:04,874
较重的恒星  轨道半径较短
The more massive star moves less,

313
00:18:04,874 --> 00:18:07,876
而较轻的恒星  轨道半径较长
and the less massive star moves more.

314
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:16,353
这一认识对于计算涅墨西斯
This insight is key to calculating where

315
00:18:16,353 --> 00:18:19,675
与太阳的相对距离至关重要
Nemesis might lie in relation to the Sun.

316
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,749
我们知道  公转周期是两千六百万年
We know it's a 26-million-year period.

317
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,241
这提示我们它究竟有多远
That tells us how far out it is.

318
00:18:25,241 --> 00:18:28,343
即其公转半径稍大于一光年
It has a radius of about a little over a light year.

319
00:18:28,343 --> 00:18:30,694
至此我们知道了运行轨道半径
So we know the orbital size.

320
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,971
科学家现已粗略算得搜索范围
Now that scientists know roughly where to look,

321
00:18:37,971 --> 00:18:41,603
寻找涅墨西斯已全面启动
the search for Nemesis is in full swing.

322
00:18:42,995 --> 00:18:47,638
目前  这一研究指向一个令人震惊的理论
And so far, that search has led to an astounding new theory.

323
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:51,642
不光是太阳有个不为人知的"兄弟"
Not only might the Sun have an undiscovered twin,

324
00:18:52,653 --> 00:18:58,157
太阳系里也许藏匿着一颗巨大的未知恒星
the solar system may be harboring a massive undiscovered planet.

325
00:19:05,234 --> 00:19:07,485
太阳邪恶双子星扰动彗星群
In the hunt for an evil twin to our Sun that

326
00:19:07,485 --> 00:19:10,737
将死亡之雨降于大地  我们努力寻其踪迹
shakes comets loose and rains death across the earth,

327
00:19:11,209 --> 00:19:15,282
万事俱备  只欠东风
all of the pieces are in place except one.

328
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:21,537
要使涅墨西斯理论成立
The Nemesis theory really needs the smoking gun of

329
00:19:19,615 --> 00:19:24,268
克利福德・强森
南加利福尼亚大学

330
00:19:21,537 --> 00:19:26,240
必须有确凿证据
actually finding direct evidence for the object itself

331
00:19:26,241 --> 00:19:28,302
证明涅墨西斯确实存在
in order for the whole thing to hold together.

332
00:19:29,494 --> 00:19:31,055
那么  为何我们现在还毫无所获
Now, why haven't we found it yet?

333
00:19:31,055 --> 00:19:34,417
事实上  有不少天文学家对此漠不关心
Actually, there are quite a few astronomers who don't pay very

334
00:19:33,957 --> 00:19:38,600
理查德・穆勒
美国劳伦斯伯克利国家实验室

335
00:19:34,418 --> 00:19:36,880
他们简单的认为
much attention to this, and simply assume that

336
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,622
如果该星存在  那么应当早就被人们发现
if it existed, it would have been found by now.

337
00:19:39,752 --> 00:19:43,755
我们坚信  在接下来的几年该星会被发现
We believe this thing can be found within the next few years.

338
00:19:43,755 --> 00:19:47,147
我们要做的  是对暗星进行一次认真研究
What it takes is a survey of dim stars.

339
00:19:52,162 --> 00:19:53,633
启用"智者"
Enter WISE,

340
00:19:53,633 --> 00:19:57,175
即沿轨道运行的大范围红外研究探测器
the orbiting "Wide-field infrared survey explorer,"

341
00:19:57,797 --> 00:20:02,460
可能成为揭开涅墨西斯之谜的强大新仪器
a powerful new tool that just might crack the Nemesis mystery.

342
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:05,383
"智者"之所以如此出色
The reason that WISE is gonna be so good

343
00:20:04,082 --> 00:20:08,655
麦克・布朗
加利福尼亚理工学院

344
00:20:05,383 --> 00:20:07,584
正是因为它采用红外技术
is because it operates in the infrared.

345
00:20:07,585 --> 00:20:09,966
简单地说  它可以观察到热源
It sees heat, basically.

346
00:20:11,058 --> 00:20:14,791
红外扫描仪通过测算热源  而非传统光源
By measuring heat instead of light, infrared scanners

347
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:18,664
可以轻易发现发热但不发光的物体
can make warm but dark objects easy to spot.

348
00:20:19,665 --> 00:20:22,917
通过红外观察热源的优势在于
The nice thing about looking in the infrared at the heat of

349
00:20:22,917 --> 00:20:26,670
恒星与太阳的距离对观测没有影响
it is you don't care how far away you are from the Sun.

350
00:20:28,222 --> 00:20:30,483
我们以木星为例
Jupiter provides an example.

351
00:20:30,724 --> 00:20:32,995
木星表面的温度
The temperature on the surface of Jupiter

352
00:20:32,996 --> 00:20:37,329
约为摄氏零下145度
measures 230 degrees below zero fahrenheit.

353
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,051
但较之摄氏零下270度的宇宙空间温度
But that's blazing hot when contrasted with

354
00:20:40,342 --> 00:20:44,245
这又是如火般炙热的
the 450-degree-below-zero temperature of space.

355
00:20:45,466 --> 00:20:47,877
所以  即便缺少太阳的照耀
So even in the absence of sunlight,

356
00:20:47,878 --> 00:20:49,849
类似木星这样较远的恒星
a distant, Jupiter-like planet

357
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:52,742
也可能在红外扫描中  发出耀眼的光芒
would glow brightly in the infrared.

358
00:20:59,227 --> 00:21:03,020
我们可以在赛车跑道上直观地了解
By visiting a motor speedway, we can see how the WISE

359
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:06,803
"智者"红外技术比对不同温度的物体
survey might help find Nemesis by exploiting the infrared

360
00:21:06,803 --> 00:21:10,415
对寻找涅墨西斯究竟有何益处
contrast between objects of different temperatures.

361
00:21:13,589 --> 00:21:17,962
在这  轰鸣的发动机只能展示过程的一半
Here, the roar of the engine only tells half the story.

362
00:21:18,713 --> 00:21:21,635
今天  我们来到驾驶技术竞速学校
I came out here today to the drive tech racing school

363
00:21:19,214 --> 00:21:23,877
亚历克・弗里喷库
加州大学伯克利分校

364
00:21:21,886 --> 00:21:23,227
坐进一辆赛车
to be in a race car

365
00:21:23,227 --> 00:21:25,809
在跑道上跑几圈
that would go zooming around this track a bunch of times.

366
00:21:25,809 --> 00:21:30,042
我们要用红外相机拍摄赛车
An idea was to film the car with an infrared camera,

367
00:21:30,043 --> 00:21:32,114
以显示出高热的物体
and show us things that are hot--

368
00:21:32,114 --> 00:21:34,285
温度高于周围环境
hotter than the outside surroundings--

369
00:21:34,286 --> 00:21:36,968
在红外光谱中发光的物体
and glowing at infrared wavelengths.

370
00:21:41,472 --> 00:21:42,472
-泰德你好啊  -你好
- So, hey Ted! - How you doing?

371
00:21:42,473 --> 00:21:43,473
幸会幸会
Good to meet you.

372
00:21:43,474 --> 00:21:44,474
彼此彼此
Likewise.

373
00:21:44,474 --> 00:21:45,474
今天是你来开车吗
Yeah. You're the driver?

374
00:21:45,475 --> 00:21:46,475
是的先生
Yes, sir.

375
00:21:46,736 --> 00:21:48,217
我们打算开多快呢
Now, how fast are we gonna be going?

376
00:21:48,217 --> 00:21:49,988
大概每小时274公里吧
Approximately 170 miles an hour.

377
00:21:49,989 --> 00:21:52,941
差不多就是普通高速路行驶速度的三倍
Now, that's about three times normal highway driving speed, so

378
00:21:52,941 --> 00:21:55,202
看来等下真的会"热火朝天"
whoa, things are really gonna heat up.

379
00:21:55,203 --> 00:21:56,203
是啊
Oh, yeah.

380
00:21:56,204 --> 00:21:57,505
闲话少说  出发吧
All right, let's go, then.

381
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:04,510
工作人员布莱尔・迪普利帮我钻进这辆车
Blair Dupree of drive tech helped me get into the car.

382
00:22:04,511 --> 00:22:06,642
带好护具  这个厚重的头盔
Good protection. This is a nice, thick helmet.

383
00:22:06,643 --> 00:22:08,664
车门都没有  这可不太容易
And it's not so easy, because there's no doors, okay.

384
00:22:08,664 --> 00:22:10,765
你得从窗户爬进去
You have to kind of climb in through a window.

385
00:22:10,766 --> 00:22:12,747
把左脚抬起来放进去
Bring your left foot up in there. Okay.

386
00:22:13,979 --> 00:22:15,119
再把右腿放进去
Bring your right foot on up.

387
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,841
我感觉自己像是"破车而入"
I feel like I'm breaking into a car.

388
00:22:17,051 --> 00:22:18,892
然后再钻进去
And then kind of slither your way in.

389
00:22:24,247 --> 00:22:26,969
在赛车里的感觉真棒
Being in that race car was really exciting.

390
00:22:26,969 --> 00:22:28,950
当我们转弯时
When I was going around the turns,

391
00:22:28,951 --> 00:22:31,292
我能感到强烈的离心力
I could really feel the g-forces.

392
00:22:32,494 --> 00:22:33,775
泰德开得不错  是吧
Ted give you a good ride, did he?

393
00:22:33,775 --> 00:22:35,376
幸亏是泰德开车
Yeah, well, I'm glad Ted was the driver.

394
00:22:35,376 --> 00:22:36,797
我真的来不了这个  我去
I couldn't do this, you know?

395
00:22:37,048 --> 00:22:40,450
我吓得腿都软了  而且我还是坐车的
I was scared out of my seat, and I wasn't even the driver, okay?

396
00:22:42,992 --> 00:22:47,165
车辆预热完毕  热成像专家
With the car nicely warmed, a FLIR infrared camera,

397
00:22:47,326 --> 00:22:50,558
罗斯・欧文斯利特架起一台红外摄像机
set up by thermal-imaging expert Ross Overstreet,

398
00:22:50,789 --> 00:22:54,381
以全新的方式观察一切事物
sees everything, literally, in a new light.

399
00:22:54,862 --> 00:22:55,552
你好  亚历克
Hello, Alex.

400
00:22:55,563 --> 00:22:56,193
罗斯  还好吗
Hey, Ross, how you doing?

401
00:22:56,193 --> 00:22:57,674
-很好  情况怎么样  -好  很好
- Doing good. How you doing? - Good, good.

402
00:22:57,674 --> 00:22:59,235
让我们看看这些红外图像
Let's look at these infrared images.

403
00:22:59,236 --> 00:23:01,197
我们正在拍摄车的尾部
Right now we're pointed at the back of the car.

404
00:23:01,197 --> 00:23:02,548
这台仪器的好处是
The best way to think about it is

405
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:04,559
与其说是摄像机它更像是测量仪
it's more of a measurement device than a camera.

406
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,872
这张图上好像有无数温度计
It's like having a million different thermometers spread across the image.

407
00:23:08,664 --> 00:23:11,626
每一个像素都能体现出测量温度
We're actually getting temperature measurements on each of those pixels.

408
00:23:11,626 --> 00:23:12,796
温度高的地方
Things that are supposed to be hot

409
00:23:12,797 --> 00:23:15,299
就呈现出红色  橘黄色和白色
look like they're glowing red and orange and white.

410
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:18,011
温度低的地方则是蓝色和黑色
Things that are cold are colored blue and black.

411
00:23:18,201 --> 00:23:20,192
也就是我们熟知的冷色调
You know, colors you associate with cool objects.

412
00:23:20,193 --> 00:23:21,634
-对  -你可以看到
- Right. - And you'll notice there's

413
00:23:22,205 --> 00:23:24,346
这辆车上有几个不同的热区
several different hot areas of the vehicle.

414
00:23:24,497 --> 00:23:27,069
我看到轮胎上的温度不太一样
Now, I see some variations across the tires.

415
00:23:27,229 --> 00:23:27,919
你可以看到
Yeah, and you'll notice that

416
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,100
一个轮胎比另外一个轮胎稍许热些
the one tire is a little bit warmer than the other.

417
00:23:30,561 --> 00:23:33,803
右胎温度果然高于左胎
The right-hand tire was indeed hotter than the left-hand tire

418
00:23:33,804 --> 00:23:36,906
因为在转弯时右胎受压更大
because there was more pressure on it during the turns.

419
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:39,819
那么右胎能达到多少度呢
So how hot is that hotter tire there?

420
00:23:39,989 --> 00:23:43,752
我们先前测量过  大概有摄氏89度
We made a measurement earlier of about 190 degrees fahrenheit.

421
00:23:43,912 --> 00:23:46,303
这跟开水的温度差不多了
Almost the temperature of boiling water on the tires.

422
00:23:46,304 --> 00:23:48,946
仅用肉眼  我们不可能区分出
When we just look by eye, we can't tell whether something is

423
00:23:48,947 --> 00:23:50,067
哪里温度更高
hotter than something else.

424
00:23:50,068 --> 00:23:52,369
但这样你就可以区分了  真不错
But here you can tell, and that's really cool.

425
00:23:52,369 --> 00:23:54,250
是的  这台摄像机在漆黑的夜里
Right. And this camera would work just as well

426
00:23:54,251 --> 00:23:56,012
和在大白天都能工作
if it was pitch black or in the middle of the day.

427
00:23:56,012 --> 00:23:58,123
阳光对它没有影响
It doesn't care about solar light at all.

428
00:24:01,747 --> 00:24:04,319
红外摄像机拍摄赛道的原理
The infrared camera sees the racetrack

429
00:24:04,459 --> 00:24:05,820
和用"智者"探测
the way the WISE survey

430
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:09,392
黑暗而又遥远的太阳系领域的原理一样
scans the dark and far-away realms of our Solar System.

431
00:24:11,545 --> 00:24:13,666
如果涅墨西斯真的存在
If Nemesis is out there,

432
00:24:13,667 --> 00:24:15,778
那么红外线应该能探测到
infrared should reveal it.

433
00:24:16,389 --> 00:24:20,112
赛车上的热点就像是那些远离太阳
The hot spots on the race car are sort of like warm,

434
00:24:20,112 --> 00:24:25,096
在寒冷的太空中熠熠发光的温暖恒星
glowing objects out in the cold depths of space, far from the Sun.

435
00:24:25,787 --> 00:24:29,630
这是一种探测遥远恒星的全新技术
This is a whole new way of discovering objects--

436
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:33,973
这些恒星利用光学望远镜是捕捉不到的
Objects too faint to be seen through a normal optical telescope,

437
00:24:33,974 --> 00:24:36,275
但红外线却能探测到
but bright enough to be detected in the infrared.

438
00:24:40,299 --> 00:24:44,422
"智者"于2011年初完成了探测任务
The WISE telescope completed its sky survey in early 2011,

439
00:24:44,953 --> 00:24:49,796
但对涅墨西斯的探测还没定论
but in the search for Nemesis, the results are still inconclusive.

440
00:24:50,817 --> 00:24:55,160
"智者"探测结果要花很长时间去分析
The WISE survey is going to take a long time to analyze,

441
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:57,873
因为它收集到了
simply because there's a huge amount of data

442
00:24:57,873 --> 00:25:00,244
海量的数据
that had been gathered by this craft.

443
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:05,458
我们仅研究了半数可能是涅墨西斯的天体
About half of the Nemesis candidates have not yet been studied.

444
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:08,772
我们预计  这个理论是对是错
But in the next few years, we expect the theory

445
00:25:08,772 --> 00:25:10,583
将在接下来的几年里被证实
will be either proven right or wrong.

446
00:25:11,074 --> 00:25:14,256
在那之前  有争议纯属正常
Until that time, it is and should be controversial.

447
00:25:17,589 --> 00:25:22,322
为何距地球这么近的恒星如此难以发现
That something so relatively near to Earth can be so obscure

448
00:25:22,453 --> 00:25:25,435
来自阿州莫比尔的弗兰克・切科夫斯基
is what Frank Jankowski of Mobile, Alabama,

449
00:25:25,586 --> 00:25:28,298
想要询问宇宙
wants to ask The Universe.

450
00:25:29,089 --> 00:25:34,143
为什么科学家们能观察到百万光年以外的天体

451
00:25:34,513 --> 00:25:38,496
却不能找出在我们太阳系边上的天体

452
00:25:39,247 --> 00:25:41,278
弗兰克  这是个有趣的问题
That's an interesting question, Frank.

453
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,460
百万光年以外的天体能被天文学家发现
The objects that are millions of light years away that

454
00:25:43,461 --> 00:25:46,523
是因为它们能发出强光
astronomers can see are powerful and luminous.

455
00:25:46,523 --> 00:25:48,464
它们能产生大量能量
They produce a lot of energy on their own,

456
00:25:48,465 --> 00:25:50,186
就像是正在爆炸的恒星
like an exploding star.

457
00:25:50,486 --> 00:25:54,259
但是在我们太阳系边上的天体可能很小
But an object near the edge of our Solar System might be small,

458
00:25:54,259 --> 00:25:56,530
只反射微乎其微的太阳光
and it reflects only a little bit of sunlight,

459
00:25:56,531 --> 00:25:59,093
所以我们在可见光的波段看不到它
so we can't see it at visible wavelengths.

460
00:25:59,344 --> 00:26:00,464
询问宇宙

461
00:26:03,767 --> 00:26:07,389
科学家在分析涅墨西斯的探测数据时
But scientist analyzed the data for signs of Nemesis,

462
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:10,202
他们有了一个令人不安的发现
they have made a disturbing discovery.

463
00:26:11,664 --> 00:26:13,195
虽然计算表明
Although calculations indicate that

464
00:26:13,455 --> 00:26:15,766
涅墨西斯要几百万年以后才会回来
Nemesis isn't due back for millions of years,

465
00:26:17,068 --> 00:26:21,721
有颗恒星正在扰乱奥尔特云中的彗星
something appears to be shaking up the comets in the oort cloud right now.

466
00:26:25,275 --> 00:26:28,317
难道涅墨西斯已经兵临城下了吗
Could Nemesis already be upon us?

467
00:26:36,264 --> 00:26:38,976
自从涅墨西斯理论被提出
Since the birth of the Nemesis hypothesis,

468
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,777
天文学家们就密切注意着
astronomers have been on the lookout

469
00:26:40,778 --> 00:26:45,051
会周期性扰乱奥尔特云中彗星引力的
for a faint red star that periodically disturbs the gravitation

470
00:26:45,051 --> 00:26:47,102
黯淡的红矮星
of the Oort Cloud comets.

471
00:26:48,534 --> 00:26:51,016
每隔2600万年  这会使得它们
This sends them on a catastrophic rendezvous

472
00:26:51,016 --> 00:26:52,787
穿越包括地球的内太阳系
with the inner Solar System,

473
00:26:53,218 --> 00:26:56,971
发生灾难性的碰撞
including Earth, every 26 million years.

474
00:26:58,903 --> 00:27:01,254
但当科学家们研究奥尔特云时
But as scientists study the Oort Cloud,

475
00:27:01,255 --> 00:27:03,376
他们发现了令人不安的迹象
they have uncovered unsettling evidence

476
00:27:03,376 --> 00:27:07,519
有东西正在干扰彗星的运行轨道
that something is disturbing comet orbits right now.

477
00:27:10,352 --> 00:27:13,464
涅墨西斯已经回来了吗
Has Nemesis already returned?

478
00:27:14,245 --> 00:27:18,558
如果太阳独立存在  没有涅墨西斯
If the Sun was all by itself, and there was no Nemesis,

479
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,170
那么奥尔特云中的彗星
then the comets in the Oort Cloud

480
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:23,742
格雷格・洛格林
加利福尼亚大学圣塔克鲁兹分校

481
00:27:20,811 --> 00:27:25,294
它们的运行轨道将是可预测和规律的
would all have very predictable and regular orbits.

482
00:27:25,294 --> 00:27:29,517
它们到达和出发的时间应该很有规律
They'd be very regular in their arrival times and departure times.

483
00:27:33,621 --> 00:27:37,584
如果只有太阳的引力干扰
Without gravitational interference from anything other than the Sun,

484
00:27:38,295 --> 00:27:40,967
奥尔特云中的彗星就如杂耍物体
Oort Cloud comets, like juggled objects,

485
00:27:41,377 --> 00:27:44,249
在宇宙中有规律得运动
could spread out evenly across the sky.

486
00:27:46,562 --> 00:27:49,884
但这并不是一些科学家们得出的结论
However, that's not what some scientists report.

487
00:27:49,884 --> 00:27:55,898
我们仰望星空  观察这些彗星从何而来
When we look out into the sky, and look at where the comets are coming from,

488
00:27:55,899 --> 00:28:01,373
它们的方向往往集中在天空的某个固定区域
their directions tend to concentrate in a certain region of the sky.

489
00:28:01,374 --> 00:28:05,026
有一个可能的解释是
And one possible explanation for that is that

490
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:09,280
这种偏移是一个我们看不见的天体
that skew is being directed by the gravitational perturbations

491
00:28:09,661 --> 00:28:13,554
发出的引力干扰所导致的
from an unseen object that is out there.

492
00:28:14,975 --> 00:28:18,638
基于这些研究  科学家们推测
Based on these observations, scientists infer

493
00:28:18,638 --> 00:28:22,301
有一个巨大的天体正在干扰奥尔特云
that a huge object is disturbing the Oort Cloud.

494
00:28:24,052 --> 00:28:27,414
这个道理和加利福尼亚运输官员
They do this the same way that California transit officials

495
00:28:27,415 --> 00:28:31,688
推测扰乱洛城交通秩序的事故如出一辙
infer that an accident is disturbing traffic patterns in Los Angeles.

496
00:28:35,872 --> 00:28:37,243
马克  我们在哪
So, Marco, where are we?

497
00:28:37,243 --> 00:28:38,443
这房间是做什么的
What is this room?

498
00:28:38,444 --> 00:28:40,375
墙上的图
Well, the map we have here on the wall,

499
00:28:40,376 --> 00:28:42,227
是高速公路系统图
that's our freeway system map.

500
00:28:42,227 --> 00:28:43,297
如你所见
And as you can see,

501
00:28:43,298 --> 00:28:46,690
它显示了洛杉矶主要的高速路线
it shows the major freeway routes in Los Angeles.

502
00:28:47,772 --> 00:28:51,164
绿点表示正常的交通车流
The green dots represent normal traffic flow,

503
00:28:51,445 --> 00:28:52,996
红点表示
while the red dots indicate

504
00:28:52,996 --> 00:28:55,808
某些原因引起了交通阻塞
that something is causing traffic to back up.

505
00:29:00,623 --> 00:29:04,426
速度只是发生事故的一个迹象
So the speed here's just one indicator that something's going on,

506
00:29:04,426 --> 00:29:05,957
但想知道到底发生了什么
but to really know what's going on,

507
00:29:05,957 --> 00:29:07,478
你必须得有一个摄像头
you either have to have a camera

508
00:29:07,478 --> 00:29:11,251
或是在现场的人告诉你到底发生了什么
or a report from somebody who's actually there and able to tell you what it is.

509
00:29:11,251 --> 00:29:12,141
非常正确
That's correct.

510
00:29:13,783 --> 00:29:15,834
天文学家总是遇到这样的问题
Astronomers have this problem all the time,

511
00:29:15,835 --> 00:29:18,937
他们试图研究他们并不能真正看到的东西
they're trying to understand what they can't actually see.

512
00:29:20,129 --> 00:29:24,842
劳拉・丹利
格里菲斯天文台

513
00:29:20,249 --> 00:29:22,100
天文学中  我们经常指出
In astronomy, we frequently infer

514
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:25,712
某物体的存在  并非因为我们亲眼所见
the existence of something, not because we can actually see it,

515
00:29:25,713 --> 00:29:27,434
而是因为我们能够看到
but because we can see the influence

516
00:29:27,435 --> 00:29:30,007
它对周围事物的影响
it has on the objects around it.

517
00:29:37,283 --> 00:29:41,696
无论是车流太多还是高峰时段的车道太少
Whether too many cars or crowding too few lanes during rush hour,

518
00:29:42,077 --> 00:29:44,649
或者是事故阻碍了交通
or an accident is slowing traffic flow,

519
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:47,141
一定有什么造成了拥堵
something causes congestion.

520
00:29:48,071 --> 00:29:51,964
既然科学家们在奥尔特云中观测到类似现象
Since scientists see similar congestion in the Oort Cloud,

521
00:29:51,965 --> 00:29:54,447
涅墨西斯有可能是罪魁祸首吗
could Nemesis be the perpetrator?

522
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:56,518
这地方真棒
This place is very impressive.

523
00:29:56,689 --> 00:29:59,451
能得到所有监控录像和探测数据
It's got all the cameras, all the sensor data,

524
00:29:59,451 --> 00:30:03,103
还有所有加州高速路巡逻事件的报告
all the California highway patrol incident reports.

525
00:30:03,104 --> 00:30:07,037
这比天文学家研究的数据多得多
This is far more data than astronomers have to work with.

526
00:30:07,628 --> 00:30:11,881
如果我们在太阳系周边布有无数摄像机
If we only had remote cameras all throughout the outskirts of the Solar System,

527
00:30:11,881 --> 00:30:13,412
我们会更好的了解它
we might know a lot more about it.

528
00:30:18,276 --> 00:30:20,357
尽管没有远程相机
Even without remote cameras,

529
00:30:20,358 --> 00:30:23,190
科学家们提出了一个非凡的理论
scientists have proposed a remarkable theory

530
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:26,152
以解释奥尔特云中的堵塞
to explain the congestion in the Oort Cloud.

531
00:30:28,575 --> 00:30:29,916
根据该理论
According to this theory,

532
00:30:29,916 --> 00:30:33,248
干扰奥尔特云的原因不是涅墨西斯
the culprit disturbing the Oort Cloud isn't Nemesis.

533
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:35,911
而是同样让人惊讶的
Instead, it's something equally

534
00:30:35,911 --> 00:30:39,924
一颗巨大且未知的恒星
astounding-- A giant, undiscovered planet,

535
00:30:39,924 --> 00:30:42,656
质量是木星的四倍
four times the mass of Jupiter.

536
00:30:43,207 --> 00:30:47,090
简言之  它是太阳系最大的恒星
In short, the largest planet in the Solar System.

537
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:50,832
科学家称它为堤喀[命运女神]
Scientists have proposed naming it Tyche.

538
00:30:52,094 --> 00:30:55,767
简单的说  堤喀是"小版的涅墨西斯"
In a nutshell, Tyche is "Nemesis light."

539
00:30:55,957 --> 00:30:58,439
涅墨西斯  在最初的假设中
Nemesis, in the original hypothesis,

540
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,110
是一颗红矮星
was literally a red dwarf star.

541
00:31:00,111 --> 00:31:03,984
质量是木星的100倍
Something that was 100 times more massive than Jupiter.

542
00:31:05,435 --> 00:31:09,248
不像涅墨西斯  堤喀不会像星星一样发光
Unlike Nemesis, Tyche would not glow like a star.

543
00:31:10,569 --> 00:31:14,762
它更像是变形版的木星
Instead, it would look like a strange version of Jupiter.

544
00:31:15,723 --> 00:31:17,544
如果你戴上夜视镜
If you put on night-vision goggles,

545
00:31:17,975 --> 00:31:21,788
会看到很不一般的景象
then it would be quite a bit more impressive sight.

546
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:26,032
你能看到云中的裂缝和闪电
You would see breaks in the clouds, and there would be lightning.

547
00:31:26,032 --> 00:31:30,465
你会看见云层被它底下的闪电
You would see the clouds light up from the lightning down

548
00:31:30,466 --> 00:31:31,096
照亮
beneath the cloud tops.

549
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:39,523
堤喀可能会影响奥尔特云中彗星的轨道
Tyche might disturb the orbit of comets in the Oort Cloud,

550
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:43,486
但它绝不是地球周期性物种灭绝的原因
but it can't be the source of Earth's periodic extinctions.

551
00:31:43,736 --> 00:31:45,507
首先  它的假定位置
First, its proposed position

552
00:31:45,508 --> 00:31:47,990
决定了其100万年的公转周期
puts it on a 1-million-year orbit,

553
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:51,442
而非像涅墨西斯一样的2600万年
not 26 million, like Nemesis.

554
00:31:51,813 --> 00:31:54,054
其次  它太小了
Second, it's too small.

555
00:31:55,576 --> 00:32:01,320
堤喀没有引力来移动彗星群
Tyche doesn't really have the gravitational mojo to dislodge comets,

556
00:32:01,321 --> 00:32:05,614
造成这些周期性的毁灭
send them crashing in these periodic extinctions--

557
00:32:05,614 --> 00:32:07,855
真的重组奥尔特云
really rearrange the Oort Cloud.

558
00:32:09,077 --> 00:32:14,201
所以它的影响仅仅是一些小的偏移
And so it's effects would be visible only in these small skews,

559
00:32:14,201 --> 00:32:19,325
而不会引发大量彗星突然来袭
and not in the form of huge pulses of comets coming out of seemingly nowhere.

560
00:32:23,469 --> 00:32:26,511
如同涅墨西斯一样  NASA的"智者"探测
Just as with Nemesis, NASA's WISE survey

561
00:32:26,512 --> 00:32:30,024
应该能探测到堤喀  只要它存在
should be able to detect Tyche, if it exists.

562
00:32:31,876 --> 00:32:34,528
当我们惊讶于太阳系可能藏有一颗
While it's surprising that our Solar System might harbor a

563
00:32:34,528 --> 00:32:37,990
巨大且未知的恒星  该理论既没有支持
giant, undiscovered planet, it doesn't support or refute the

564
00:32:37,991 --> 00:32:42,474
也没有驳斥未知的涅墨西斯的存在
idea that it also harbors the undiscovered star Nemesis.

565
00:32:42,665 --> 00:32:44,956
但近期一个对外太阳系的发现
But a recent finding in the outer Solar System

566
00:32:45,287 --> 00:32:48,409
可能有助于探索涅墨西斯是否存在
may shed more light on whether Nemesis really exists,

567
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:52,422
和了解它对地球生命的威胁
and the kind of threat it may pose to life on Earth.

568
00:32:54,064 --> 00:32:56,646
2003年  天文学家麦克・布朗
In 2003, astronomer Mike Brown

569
00:32:56,987 --> 00:32:59,719
有了一个历史性的重大发现
made a historic discovery

570
00:32:59,719 --> 00:33:03,402
他在夜空中发现了一颗令人无法解释的恒星
when he found something floating around the night sky he couldn't explain.

571
00:33:03,772 --> 00:33:06,153
我记得我发现塞得娜的那天
I remember the day that I discovered Sedna.

572
00:33:06,154 --> 00:33:09,156
看着我电脑的屏幕和那些图片
Looking at it on my computer screen, looking at these pictures,

573
00:33:07,325 --> 00:33:12,008
麦克・布朗
加利福尼亚理工学院

574
00:33:09,157 --> 00:33:11,959
我的第一反应是"这不是真的"
my first reaction was "That can't be real."

575
00:33:11,959 --> 00:33:12,919
那太遥远了
It's too far away.

576
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,632
不会有这样的东西存在于太阳系中
Nothing like that exists in the Solar System.

577
00:33:18,684 --> 00:33:20,055
他无意中发现的
What he stumbled upon

578
00:33:20,056 --> 00:33:23,418
恰好是一颗比月球要小的小恒星
turned out to be a planetoid just smaller than our moon,

579
00:33:24,099 --> 00:33:26,100
现在被命名为塞得娜
now named Sedna.

580
00:33:27,201 --> 00:33:30,363
然而塞得娜引出了一个科学难题
But Sedna presents a scientific quandary.

581
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:35,368
塞得娜离太阳最近距离
At its nearest point, Sedna lies about three times farther away

582
00:33:35,368 --> 00:33:39,951
是木星和太阳距离的三倍  在此区域中
from the Sun than Pluto, in a region where astronomers never

583
00:33:39,952 --> 00:33:42,924
天文学家从没想过会发现恒星
expected to find planetary bodies.

584
00:33:43,685 --> 00:33:46,016
这是我们知道的
It's the coldest, most distant place

585
00:33:46,017 --> 00:33:48,128
整个太阳系中最寒冷和遥远的地方
that we know in the whole Solar System.

586
00:33:48,439 --> 00:33:49,740
如果你坐在塞得娜的表面
If you were sitting on the surface of Sedna,

587
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,382
你可以拿一根大头针  然后伸直手臂
you could take a straight pin and hold it out at arm's length,

588
00:33:53,673 --> 00:33:57,185
仅用大头针的顶端  你就能覆盖住太阳
and with the head of that pin, you could cover up the Sun.

589
00:33:58,557 --> 00:34:01,879
除了处在出人意料的边远区域
In addition to being in an unexpectedly distant region,

590
00:34:02,681 --> 00:34:07,224
塞得娜还在太阳系中有着广阔的椭圆形轨道
Sedna also takes a wildly elliptical orbit through the Solar System.

591
00:34:08,085 --> 00:34:11,707
奥秘就在于塞得娜附近没有任何事物
The mystery is there's nothing anywhere near Sedna that could

592
00:34:11,708 --> 00:34:15,621
可以产生如此遥远和极端的轨道
account for an orbit that distant and that extreme.

593
00:34:16,802 --> 00:34:20,635
它现在所处的位置  不受任何物体影响
The place where it is now, nothing ever affects it.

594
00:34:20,635 --> 00:34:22,436
它周围没有任何星球
It doesn't come close to any planets,

595
00:34:22,607 --> 00:34:24,448
没有恒星接近过它
there are no stars that ever come close to it.

596
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:29,482
那是什么迫使塞得娜形成如此独特的轨道
So what forced Sedna into its unique orbit?

597
00:34:30,103 --> 00:34:34,136
理论上  死星涅墨西斯是否对其有影响呢
And in theory, could the death star Nemesis have played a role?

598
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:40,631
对于布朗来说  蹦床帮助解释了
For Brown, the bounce of a trampoline offers a way to

599
00:34:40,632 --> 00:34:43,934
塞得娜是如何形成让科学家
understand how Sedna ended up in an orbit

600
00:34:43,934 --> 00:34:46,125
匪夷所思的独特轨道
that remains a head-scratcher for astronomers.

601
00:34:47,427 --> 00:34:50,939
以60里面为单位  我身后的测量杆
I have behind me a measuring stick that gives how high I'm

602
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:54,152
能测出我将要跳多高
gonna bounce in 2-foot intervals you see here.

603
00:34:54,303 --> 00:34:58,266
弹跳高度代表  在我的运行轨道上
And what that bounce is supposed to represent is how far away

604
00:34:58,266 --> 00:35:00,708
我离太阳有多远
from the Sun I am in my orbit.

605
00:35:00,708 --> 00:35:04,060
在普通的恒星轨道上  圆形的恒星轨道
In a normal planetary orbit, in a circular planetary orbit, the

606
00:35:04,271 --> 00:35:06,152
恒星围绕着太阳运动
planet circles around the Sun,

607
00:35:06,153 --> 00:35:09,005
和太阳总是保持不变的距离
always staying the same distance from the Sun.

608
00:35:09,005 --> 00:35:11,236
就有点像我站在蹦床上
And that's sort of like me staying on a trampoline, always

609
00:35:11,487 --> 00:35:13,518
和地面总是保持着相等距离
the same distance from the floor.

610
00:35:13,649 --> 00:35:14,509
除了沿着圆形轨道运动
Other sorts of orbits can be,

611
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:15,980
其它的公转轨道
instead of going in a circular orbit,

612
00:35:16,251 --> 00:35:18,913
可以环绕着太阳  沿着椭圆轨道运动
you can go in an elliptical orbit around the Sun.

613
00:35:18,913 --> 00:35:21,795
你远离太阳  又朝着太阳转回来
You move away from the Sun, you come back towards the Sun.

614
00:35:21,796 --> 00:35:23,897
所以你会越来越远然后越来越近
And so you'll be moving further away and getting closer.

615
00:35:23,897 --> 00:35:28,610
就和你在蹦床上开始上下跳动一样
And that would be starting to jump up and down on the trampoline.

616
00:35:29,822 --> 00:35:31,463
如同地心引力维持公转
Like gravity keeping us in orbit,

617
00:35:31,914 --> 00:35:33,975
当我们到达弹跳顶点
when we reach the apex on the trampoline,

618
00:35:35,056 --> 00:35:37,127
重力会把我们拉下来
gravity will pull us back down.

619
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,751
所以只要没有什么干扰我  我就会一直
So as long as nothing happens to me, I stay in this orbit

620
00:35:41,221 --> 00:35:43,242
在这条轨道上  上下跳动
forever, jumping up and down,

621
00:35:43,243 --> 00:35:44,804
总是达到同一高度
always to the same height.

622
00:35:48,007 --> 00:35:50,979
但一些不平常的因素影响着塞得娜
But something unusual afflicted Sedna.

623
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:54,252
它碰到了一种神秘力量
It brushed up against a mysterious force

624
00:35:54,813 --> 00:35:59,136
将它推入了一个没有恒星存在的区域
that shoved it into a region where no planetary body should exist.

625
00:35:59,296 --> 00:36:02,808
有人怀疑这种力量就是涅墨西斯
Some suspect that force was Nemesis.

626
00:36:02,999 --> 00:36:06,872
假如太阳的邪恶双子星存在
And if the Sun's evil twin is out there,

627
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:10,045
科学家们便可以预测
scientists can tell exactly

628
00:36:10,045 --> 00:36:13,497
我们何时看到其回归的可怕迹象
when we'll see the terrifying signs of its return.

629
00:36:20,123 --> 00:36:23,826
就在天文学家寻找一颗名为涅墨西斯时
As astronomers search for a death star named Nemesis

630
00:36:24,037 --> 00:36:27,629
它可能会周期性对地球造成大量物种灭绝
that might periodically cause mass extinctions on Earth,

631
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:31,272
近期对于小世界塞得娜的发现
the recent discovery of a tiny world named Sedna

632
00:36:31,803 --> 00:36:33,614
也许提供了线索
could prove key.

633
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:38,979
亿万年前  塞得娜围绕着太阳公转
Billions of years ago, Sedna revolved around our Sun,

634
00:36:39,219 --> 00:36:42,601
就像其他星球一样  其轨道近乎圆形
like other planets, in a nearly circular orbit.

635
00:36:43,252 --> 00:36:46,414
然而有两件不同寻常的事情发生了
But then two strange things happened.

636
00:36:46,605 --> 00:36:51,138
首先  塞得娜被某物推入一个椭圆轨道
First, something forced Sedna into an extremely elliptical orbit.

637
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:56,203
然后另有其物把轨道推到如此远的地方
And then something else pushed that orbit out so far that it

638
00:36:56,203 --> 00:36:59,555
以至科学家们无法给出合理的解释
seems to defy any visible explanation.

639
00:37:00,346 --> 00:37:04,219
首先  它的椭圆形轨道是如何形成的
The first question-- What caused it's elliptical orbit--

640
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:06,662
已被轻易阐解
is fairly easily explained.

641
00:37:07,542 --> 00:37:10,474
它可能仅是由于来自外部的巨型气体恒星
It could simply have been gravitational tugs from the

642
00:37:10,475 --> 00:37:13,787
木星和土星所产生的引力牵引
outer gas giants Jupiter and Saturn.

643
00:37:15,009 --> 00:37:17,461
我们可以用蹦床来说明
A trampoline can help illustrate.

644
00:37:21,084 --> 00:37:23,165
为了真正了解太阳系内恒星轨道的运行方式
To really understand how orbits in the Solar System work

645
00:37:23,165 --> 00:37:24,986
以及我们找到的这些极椭圆的轨道
and we get these very elliptical orbits,

646
00:37:24,987 --> 00:37:26,578
我们要尽量在蹦床上跳高点
we need to get more height on the trampoline.

647
00:37:25,167 --> 00:37:29,830
麦克・布朗
加利福尼亚理工学院

648
00:37:27,068 --> 00:37:29,740
我可做不到  所以  肯  你来帮我跳
And I can't do it, so, Ken, I'm gonna need your help.

649
00:37:29,961 --> 00:37:32,423
-好极了  我准备好了  -我先站开点
- Well, awesome, I' ready to help. - Let me get out of your way.

650
00:37:35,876 --> 00:37:39,549
正如蹦床上多一个人的帮助就会使弹跳更高
Just as extra people on a trampoline create extra bounce,

651
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:44,212
太阳系中巨型气态恒星间产生的重力弹力
the large gas giants in the Solar System can create enough

652
00:37:44,212 --> 00:37:50,307
足以使小恒星的轨道伸展成宽阔的椭圆型
gravitational bounce to stretch a smaller body's orbit into a wide ellipse.

653
00:37:51,749 --> 00:37:54,601
这代表塞得娜在椭圆轨道上运行
So here's Sedna on a nice elliptical orbit.

654
00:37:54,831 --> 00:37:58,013
紧接着塞得娜向其中一颗恒星靠近了一点
But then Sedna got a little bit close to one of the planets.

655
00:37:58,524 --> 00:38:01,426
与此同时  这颗恒星所提供的额外引力
As soon as it does that, the extra gravity of the planet

656
00:38:01,427 --> 00:38:05,150
促使了椭圆轨道的一点点变大
gives it a little boost into an even more elliptical orbit.

657
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:08,362
之后它靠近另外一颗恒星  也就是木星
But then it gets close to another planet-- Let's say Jupiter.

658
00:38:08,362 --> 00:38:09,492
这是木星
Here comes Jupiter.

659
00:38:10,094 --> 00:38:11,244
它弹跳得更高了
It bounces even higher.

660
00:38:11,675 --> 00:38:12,755
借助木星足够强的弹力
With enough bouncing from Jupiter,

661
00:38:13,777 --> 00:38:15,918
我们可以使塞得娜弹出太阳系
we could bounce Sedna all of the way out of the Solar System.

662
00:38:21,223 --> 00:38:24,465
由木星和土星证明了的轨道弹力
The orbital bounce provided by Jupiter and Saturn

663
00:38:24,726 --> 00:38:28,429
能帮助解释塞得娜的轨道为何呈椭圆状
can explain how Sedna's orbit got its elliptical shape,

664
00:38:28,919 --> 00:38:33,202
但其不能解释它为何最终被推入太阳系的边缘
but not how it ended up being forced into a distant region of the solar System,

665
00:38:33,873 --> 00:38:38,316
在那里  科学家们认为不会恒星存在
where scientists never expected to find a planetary body.

666
00:38:39,628 --> 00:38:41,919
塞得娜原本是在一个椭圆轨道上
Sedna was on an elliptical orbit,

667
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,331
现在它运行得逐渐越来越远
getting further and further and further.

668
00:38:44,332 --> 00:38:48,055
它在远端轨道的时候  发生了什么
And then something happened to it when it was out here.

669
00:38:49,396 --> 00:38:52,858
另一种引力将其强行推入另一个轨道
Some other gravitational force pushed it off into a different orbit,

670
00:38:52,859 --> 00:38:56,221
导致它不会回到它之前的公转轨道
and so it didn't come back to the same place it was before.

671
00:39:01,026 --> 00:39:04,158
就好像有某种擦身而过的次要引力场
It's as if some second gravitational force was passing by

672
00:39:04,588 --> 00:39:07,220
把塞得娜强行推进一个不同的蹦床上
and shoved Sedna onto a different trampoline,

673
00:39:07,631 --> 00:39:10,453
因此它被弹入了一个意想不到的地方
so that it bounces in an unexpected region.

674
00:39:12,445 --> 00:39:17,769
最有可能的情况是太阳附近有另一颗恒星
The most likely answer is that there was another star very close to the Sun

675
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,882
这段时间塞得娜正在经历这个过程
at the time when Sedna was going through this process.

676
00:39:21,632 --> 00:39:24,844
太阳系可能是从一丛恒星群中诞生而成的
The Solar System probably formed in a cluster of stars,

677
00:39:24,845 --> 00:39:28,718
所以它与邻近的恒星甚至是流浪恒星的交汇
and so close encounters with nearby stars, nearby rogue planets even,

678
00:39:27,497 --> 00:39:31,940
格雷格・洛格林
加州大学圣塔克鲁兹分校

679
00:39:29,149 --> 00:39:29,819
这样的事情
were much more common

680
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:34,283
在太阳系形成的最初期是很寻常的事情
during the very earliest days of the Solar System's formation.

681
00:39:37,636 --> 00:39:41,939
太阳的这些兄弟姐妹们大多早已无影无踪
Most of these solar brothers and sisters have long since dispersed.

682
00:39:42,289 --> 00:39:44,210
但根据涅墨西斯假说
But according to the Nemesis hypothesis,

683
00:39:44,581 --> 00:39:48,254
有一颗仍逗留于此  它仍然环绕着太阳
one of them is still out there, still circling the Sun,

684
00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:52,137
仍旧周期性的引发彗星冲撞
still causing periodic chaos amongst the comets,

685
00:39:52,618 --> 00:39:57,121
仍然在等待再次将灭顶之灾降于地球
and still waiting to rain death on the Earth once more.

686
00:39:57,572 --> 00:39:58,552
如果假设成立
If that is correct,

687
00:39:58,843 --> 00:40:01,985
我们的后代在涅墨西斯归来之时
future generations will be faced with a monumental threat

688
00:40:02,456 --> 00:40:04,637
将面临一场生死浩劫
when Nemesis returns.

689
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:06,979
时间约为一千万年
In 10 million years.

690
00:40:09,742 --> 00:40:12,504
月亮  火星这些行星
The Moon, Mars, the planets would basically

691
00:40:12,815 --> 00:40:15,016
它们在以后还是会保持原状
be unaltered from their current condition.

692
00:40:15,227 --> 00:40:17,568
在地球上  城市可能不复存在了
On Earth, cities might not be there,

693
00:40:17,929 --> 00:40:19,250
但是对于陆地来说
but the continents would still be

694
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:22,452
极有可能与它们现在所处的位置不差分毫
almost in exactly the same places that they are now.

695
00:40:27,336 --> 00:40:29,968
但是  根据涅墨西斯假说
But according to the Nemesis hypothesis,

696
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:34,242
距太阳一光之遥  一场巨变正在进行中
a major change is underway one light year from the Sun.

697
00:40:36,044 --> 00:40:39,757
一颗暗红的恒星已经进入了奥尔特云
A dark-reddish star has entered the Oort Cloud.

698
00:40:40,407 --> 00:40:42,488
涅墨西斯归来了
Nemesis has returned.

699
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,762
如果人类仍在地球上生存
If humans still exist on Earth,

700
00:40:46,762 --> 00:40:50,985
他们即将面临一个缓缓酝酿的宇宙威胁
they'll face a slow-building but imminent cosmic threat.

701
00:40:54,128 --> 00:40:58,361
奥尔特云团可能有十亿余颗彗星
The Oort Cloud contains perhaps 10 trillion comets, maybe even more.

702
00:40:55,840 --> 00:41:00,423
亚历克・弗里喷库
加州大学伯克利分校

703
00:40:58,532 --> 00:41:00,103
但是  它相当庞大
But remember, it's really big.

704
00:41:00,103 --> 00:41:02,214
所以若你置身奥尔特云团之中
So if you were in the Oort Cloud,

705
00:41:02,215 --> 00:41:05,477
它不会让你时刻都被彗星撞击
it's not like you would be pelted by comets all the time.

706
00:41:05,478 --> 00:41:07,950
它们之间的间距一般都很大
The spaces between them would pretty big.

707
00:41:13,194 --> 00:41:15,555
就像这颗杂耍人手中的保龄球
Like a bowling ball in a juggler's hands,

708
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:19,098
涅墨西斯只会让少数彗星轨道混乱
Nemesis simply shuffles some comets out of its way.

709
00:41:21,041 --> 00:41:24,463
奥尔特云团的中间有一块空旷的地方
The Oort Cloud has an empty region in the middle.

710
00:41:22,131 --> 00:41:26,444
理查德・穆勒
美国劳伦斯伯克力国家实验室

711
00:41:24,463 --> 00:41:27,015
它是被木星和太阳清理干净的
It's been cleaned out by Jupiter and by the Sun.

712
00:41:27,015 --> 00:41:28,576
我们就生活在这里
We live in that region.

713
00:41:30,498 --> 00:41:32,239
但随着涅墨西斯的靠近
But as Nemesis approaches,

714
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,942
太阳系的内部就成了一个射击场
the inner Solar System becomes a shooting gallery.

715
00:41:37,004 --> 00:41:39,315
因此有可能会出现数量比平时稍多的彗星
And so there would start to be a few more comets than usual,

716
00:41:39,316 --> 00:41:42,058
然后突然  满眼望去  尽皆彗星
and then, suddenly, there are just comets, comets coming all the time.

717
00:41:43,899 --> 00:41:49,863
数量最多的时  每年将有一千至一万颗彗星
And at the peak, there might be 1,000 to 10,000 comets per year in the sky.

718
00:41:55,899 --> 00:41:57,230
分析显示
According to the projections

719
00:41:57,641 --> 00:42:00,553
地球会成为会成万箭彗星的靶心
Earth would be in the crosshairs of this comet storm

720
00:42:00,973 --> 00:42:02,994
长达一百万年之久
for a million years.

721
00:42:04,046 --> 00:42:05,447
在这一百万年中
Over a period of a million years,

722
00:42:05,977 --> 00:42:10,160
可能有约十亿颗彗星造访
there would be visits by about a billion comets.

723
00:42:10,161 --> 00:42:11,452
事实上  你可以算一算
Actually, you do the calculation,

724
00:42:11,842 --> 00:42:14,003
总归有一颗会撞上地球  或者两颗
it turns out one of them will hit the Earth. One or two.

725
00:42:18,117 --> 00:42:20,358
很难准确预言
It'd be difficult to predict exactly

726
00:42:20,359 --> 00:42:22,130
它究竟会在何时发生
when the impact would happen,

727
00:42:22,131 --> 00:42:24,683
不过可能会有这么个阶段
but there would be this phase--

728
00:42:24,683 --> 00:42:27,335
是一段危险的时间
This sort of danger zone in which the chances

729
00:42:27,735 --> 00:42:30,697
在此期间  彗星撞击地球的几率
for a catastrophic impact with something of a comet's size

730
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:33,810
要比现在高很多
would be much, much higher than they are now.

731
00:42:38,614 --> 00:42:42,997
这次冲撞会再次引发地球物种覆灭吗
Will the impact spark another catastrophic extinction on Earth?

732
00:42:43,128 --> 00:42:44,318
有可能
Perhaps.

733
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:46,941
除非人类坐以待毙
But only if we let it happen.

734
00:42:49,823 --> 00:42:53,896
我喜欢开玩笑说涅墨西斯这次失算了
I like to joke that Nemesis planned this one poorly.

735
00:42:54,267 --> 00:42:56,578
我们处于上次大灭绝与下次之间
In between the last extinction and the next one,

736
00:42:56,579 --> 00:43:01,022
高智能的生物有大把的时间集中精力
there's plenty of time for intelligent life to get its act together

737
00:43:01,023 --> 00:43:03,875
确保涅墨西斯再次归来时
to make sure that next time Nemesis comes back

738
00:43:04,295 --> 00:43:06,036
虽天空彗星满布
and the sky is filled with comets,

739
00:43:06,767 --> 00:43:08,308
却都不会撞击地球
to make sure that none of them hit us.

740
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:12,471
覆灭之路是无法避免的吗
Is this future inevitable?

741
00:43:12,662 --> 00:43:14,873
除非科学家们找到涅墨西斯
Until scientists either discover Nemesis

742
00:43:15,194 --> 00:43:16,845
或完全否认其存在
or definitively rule it out,

743
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:19,547
没人能够确定
no one can know for sure.

744
00:43:20,799 --> 00:43:24,181
要知道这不仅仅只是一次抽象的假设
It's important to realize this is not just an abstract discussion.

745
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:27,093
克利福德・强森
南加利福尼亚大学

746
00:43:25,112 --> 00:43:29,585
这些物体撞击地球无疑是小几率事件
Clearly, these objects colliding with Earth happen very rarely.

747
00:43:29,586 --> 00:43:32,328
但换个角度来说  当它们真的撞上来了
But on the other hand, when they do collide,

748
00:43:32,488 --> 00:43:34,389
它们带来的冲击是巨大的
they're extremely cataclysmic.

749
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:36,291
所以我们能做的
So what we need to be able to do

750
00:43:36,672 --> 00:43:39,594
是要更进一步的了解太阳系
is get better understanding of our Solar System,

751
00:43:39,905 --> 00:43:41,256
并密切留意我们的天空
and keep an eye on the sky,

752
00:43:41,406 --> 00:43:43,858
因为它可能会是决定我们生死的关键
because it maybe crucial for our survival.

753
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:49,282
如果未来有一天  真的彗星漫天
If the future sky one day does fill with comets,

754
00:43:49,492 --> 00:43:52,914
人类也许会找到一条自救之路
perhaps humanity will have found a way to save itself

755
00:43:52,915 --> 00:43:55,276
而非最终成为太阳邪恶双子星的又一牺牲品
rather than end up one more victim of the Sun's evil twin.
