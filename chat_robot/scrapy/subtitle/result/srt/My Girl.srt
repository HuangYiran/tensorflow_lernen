2
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:54,930
I was born jaundiced.

3
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,840
Once I sat on a toilet seat
at a truck stop and caught hemorrhoids.

4
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:03,310
I've learned to live with a chicken bone
lodged in my throat for three years.

5
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:07,470
So I knew dad would be devastated
when he learned my latest affliction.

6
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:10,040
Dad, I don't want
to upset you...

7
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:14,180
but my left breast is developing
significantly faster than my right.

8
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:16,550
It can only mean one thing: Cancer.

9
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,920
I'm dying.

10
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:24,630
Sweetie, hand me the mayonnaise
out of the fridge.

11
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:41,180
Who's in?
Raise your hand.

12
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,180
Are you coming or not,
Thomas J.?

13
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,620
- I don't think so...
- I knew he wouldn't.

14
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,350
I have to go home...

15
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,180
To play with his dolls.

16
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:53,050
Leave him alone.

17
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,320
Come on. Let's go.

18
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,230
You didn't pay me.

19
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,700
How do I know
you'll show us one?

20
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:08,330
You're a baby.

21
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:12,110
All right. Here.

22
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,850
Follow me
and don't say a word.

23
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,720
You ready?

24
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:41,340
You sure you want to see it?
Or are you yellow?

25
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,810
I'm not chicken.

26
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,740
Lean forward.

27
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,480
It's empty.

28
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:55,010
- You're so weird.
- I want my money back.

29
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,720
- I was afraid of this.
- Of what?

30
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,950
Sometimes
when we get them...

31
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,620
they're not
completely dead.

32
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,790
Like when they cut
a chicken's head off...

33
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,830
and they still run around.

34
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,960
You're full of shit.

35
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,030
I bet she's roaming
around this house somewhere.

36
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,140
There she is
in the rocking chair.

37
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,360
Hi, Gramoo.

38
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:51,140
Vada, would you bring down
my cigarettes?

39
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:02,120
See you later.

40
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:07,890
- Did you know he was my wood shop teacher?
- You took wood shop?

41
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,690
I made a tie rack.

42
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,330
- The fluid's mixed?
- Yes.

43
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,300
Put them on the stool.

44
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,670
Guess what?
I beat Thomas J. in Monopoly.

45
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,840
The rack holds six ties.

46
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,350
I still have mine.

47
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,580
- Arthur!
- Vada!

48
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:36,350
- I beat Thomas J. in Monopoly.
- Good for you.

49
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,950
Once you put hotels on Boardwalk
and Park Place, you're a shoo-in.

50
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,520
- I like to buy railroads.
- We're trying to work.

51
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,070
Cruella De Vil
stole all the puppies.

52
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,580
She was going to make
fur out of them.

53
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,170
Hand me the cannula.

54
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,910
<i>There he was
just-a walkin' down the street</i>

55
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:08,850
<i>Singin' "doo-wah diddy-diddy
dum-diddy-doo"</i>

56
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,890
<i>Poppin' his fingers
and a-shufflin'...</i>

57
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,930
- Vada!
- Dad?

58
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:18,630
I'm embalming my high school teacher.
Don't sing.

59
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,570
All right, Arthur.
Slide him to me a little bit.

60
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,840
Let's put him in
a nice model C-501...

61
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:33,570
bronze stainless
Eternal Journey.

62
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:36,380
He'll look like a champion.

63
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,910
Is Mr. Harry Sultenfuss in?

64
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,420
Sure. Come on in.

65
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:29,300
Have you had
the unfortunate experience...

66
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:31,630
of recently
losing a loved one?

67
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,840
Could I see your dad
for a second?

68
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,480
Dad! Somebody's here!

69
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,180
He's downstairs
working on Mr. Layton.

70
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:50,520
Prostate cancer. Once it hits
your prostate, you're a goner.

71
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,060
How may I help you?

72
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:00,530
I'm Shelly DeVoto.

73
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,300
We spoke regarding
the makeup artist job.

74
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,860
- Yes.
- It's still available, I hope?

75
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,630
I think so.

76
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:11,100
I'm a licensed cosmetologist.

77
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:15,200
I worked for two years
at the Dino Raphael Salon.

78
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,840
My customers cried
when I said I was leaving.

79
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:23,610
I have a wonderful disposition.
I put people at ease.

80
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,710
These people
are already at ease.

81
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:30,590
This is not a beauty parlor.
It's a funeral parlor.

82
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:34,570
- They're dead?
- They are.

83
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:36,400
Stiffs?

84
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,330
Deceased.

85
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,200
The ad just said
"makeup artist."

86
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,240
Excuse me a second,
will you?

87
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,240
Sure.

88
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,580
Hi, George.
This is a 1258.

89
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:52,240
I didn't want
the burnished handles.

90
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,050
- Is that your camper?
- Yes. It is.

91
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,680
That's really cool.

92
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,590
Hello.

93
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,690
She's shy.

94
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:06,920
Put it back
in the display room.

95
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,930
Daddy, how come
that coffin's so small?

96
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,700
They come in all sizes,
just like shoes.

97
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:21,080
- Is it for a child?
- Of course not.

98
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,980
Then who's it for?

99
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,380
Short people.
Very short people.

100
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:29,150
Excuse me.
What about the job?

101
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,780
Pardon?

102
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,720
I need the job.

103
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:35,120
You still want it?
Even though...

104
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,630
Sure.
It's no big deal.

105
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,560
You see,
all my former clients...

106
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,570
will eventually die...

107
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,630
and all your clients
used to be alive.

108
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,800
So they have something
in common.

109
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,970
You'd do hair and makeup
and answer the phone.

110
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,780
- You've got a deal.
- You can start right away.

111
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,780
Call me Harry.

112
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,580
Is this what
you'd normally...

113
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:03,710
wear for work?

114
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,660
Don't get me wrong.
I like it.

115
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:10,060
- But...
- I'll take good care of these people.

116
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:12,830
They deserve it.
They're dead.

117
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,130
All they've got left
is their looks.

118
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,780
Look at this.
No feet.

119
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,950
Wow.
A real Evel Knievel.

120
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,230
What are you doing in my garage?!

121
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,740
Get out of here!

122
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,270
Hi, Veda.
What's wrong today?

123
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,300
I'm very sick.

124
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:29,810
Take a seat.
I'll check if the doctor can see you.

125
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:36,080
Vada's here.
She says she's sick.

126
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,740
She looks all right.

127
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:41,490
He'll see you.

128
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,520
Why don't you go in?

129
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,830
Well, what is it?
I can handle it.

130
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,590
You're perfectly healthy.

131
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:57,500
That can't be.
I have the classic symptoms.

132
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:00,630
Did they bring
Mr. Layton to your house?

133
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,940
- Yes.
- You've got to stop this.

134
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:06,540
There's absolutely
nothing wrong with you.

135
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:17,150
I'll just have to get
a second opinion.

136
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:25,230
What did he say
is wrong with you?

137
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,100
The whole medical profession
is a crock.

138
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:30,500
Wait up for me!

139
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:49,180
- Look!
- At what?

140
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,720
That's Mr. Bixler.
Let's go talk to him.

141
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:54,220
I don't want to talk
to no teacher.

142
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:59,020
Mademoiselle Sultenfuss
and the amazing Dr. J.

143
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,030
- How's your summer?
- Okay.

144
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,760
Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books
for summer reading.

145
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,100
Really? Already?
The summer's just begun.

146
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:10,440
Yes. Now I'm reading
"War and Peace" for fun.

147
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:13,030
No wonder
you're my prize pupil.

148
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:16,280
- What about you, Thomas J.?
- I haven't started.

149
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:18,650
Get on his case, Vada.

150
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,480
How come you're painting
this house?

151
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:24,510
Well, I just bought it.
Now I'm fixing it up.

152
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,020
This is one big house
for one single person.

153
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:30,550
Well, you never can tell.

154
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,600
I might get a pet.

155
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,630
How are you going to pay
for this house if you're not working?

156
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,830
I'm going to teach
creative writing.

157
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:45,000
- I'm doing some work.
- How much does it cost?

158
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,710
- Thirty-five dollars.
- What do you get for that?

159
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:51,180
Me. Two hours a week
talking about poetry.

160
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,220
Is this an interrogation, Vada?

161
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,150
No.

162
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,950
Well, I guess I'll go home
and finish off "War and Peace."

163
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:01,620
It's summer.
You're kids. Go play.

164
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:11,100
Want to go to Gray's Orchard
and pick some peaches?

165
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:12,970
No. I'm going home.

166
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,870
Why? It's not dinner time yet.

167
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:18,430
You're like a dog.
You just go home to eat.

168
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:21,070
Don't pee on the hydrant!

169
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:42,690
<i>Bill</i>

170
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:47,760
<i>I love you so
I always will</i>

171
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,400
<i>I look at you
and see the passion</i>

172
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,780
<i>Eyes of May</i>

173
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:58,870
<i>Oh, but am I ever
gonna see</i>

174
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:02,350
<i>My wedding day</i>

175
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,550
Trooper Gwynn called.
There was a big accident.

176
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,090
They're bringing
in two tomorrow.

177
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,590
Excuse me.
I finished Mr. Layton's hair.

178
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,390
He kind of looked...

179
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:15,160
- What's wrong with her?
- She's pretending.

180
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,100
Get up and eat your broccoli.

181
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,270
I think it's my prostate.

182
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,070
Something like
a" Sky Lounge? ''

183
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,770
How many removals...?

184
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:29,180
<i>I got rhythm
I got music</i>

185
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:33,280
<i>I got my man
Who could ask for anything more</i>

186
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,650
<i>I got daisies</i>

187
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,690
<i>In green pastures</i>

188
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,690
I had a body
in my bedroom.

189
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:44,130
<i>I got my man
Who could ask for anything more</i>

190
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,960
- Who's winning?
- I am.

191
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,580
Look!
Vada and her little boyfriend.

192
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,610
He's not my boyfriend.

193
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,010
I bet she kisses him
on the lips.

194
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:07,520
- You think I'd kiss that ugly thing?
- Yeah, anyway.

195
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,080
Come on. Let's go.

196
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,210
Judy's father
owns the Bijou theater.

197
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,290
We see all the movies
we want for free.

198
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:17,160
- Maybe you can come sometime?
- Don't invite her.

199
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:19,630
She'll bring her boyfriend.

200
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,890
<i>Vada and Thomas</i>

201
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:23,700
<i>Sittin' in a tree</i>

202
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:27,640
<i>K-I-S-S-I-N-G</i>

203
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:31,570
<i>First comes love
Then comes marriage</i>

204
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:36,580
<i>Then comes Thomas J.
in the baby carriage</i>

205
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:37,910
You know...

206
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,810
don't let them upset you.

207
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:43,690
I'm not upset.
I would never play with them.

208
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:47,520
I surround myself with people
I find intellectually stimulating.

209
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:55,730
Want a piece of chocolate?

210
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,030
- I'm allergic to it.
- To chocolate?

211
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,660
- He's allergic to everything.
- Chocolate?

212
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,300
To everything.

213
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:08,310
That's a pretty ring.

214
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,870
It's a mood ring.

215
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,750
- It tells my mood.
- It doesn't work.

216
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,810
- It's always black.
- Only when you're around.

217
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,980
You put me
in a bad mood.

218
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:19,060
Maybe black
means you're happy.

219
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,420
I don't think so.

220
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,890
Shelly,
how can I get $35?

221
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,990
She's crazy. She wants to go
to school over the summer.

222
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,590
It's not a real school.
A writing class.

223
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,600
I want to be a writer.

224
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:34,070
Her sweetie pie's
the teacher.

225
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,400
Shut your
big, fat mouth!

226
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,940
I think you'd make
a fine writer.

227
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:40,980
Did you ask your dad?

228
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:42,570
He won't give it to me.

229
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,670
You don't know that.

230
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,240
Ask him.

231
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,720
<i>Edith, what channel
is Cronkite on?</i>

232
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,980
<i>Channel two, Archie.</i>

233
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:55,060
<i>The one we don't watch
because you always say...</i>

234
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,890
<i>Walter Cronkite
is a communist.</i>

235
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,240
<i>I never said that, Edith.</i>

236
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,210
<i>The man ain't all red.</i>

237
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:14,270
<i>What's wrong with this?
Nothing's coming on.</i>

238
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:16,280
<i>I'll help you, Daddy.</i>

239
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:19,510
Daddy, can I have $35?

240
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:21,380
That's a lot
for a little girl.

241
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:23,110
It's for school.

242
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,020
A summer writing class.

243
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,680
Any more soda left?

244
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,190
Shelly thinks I'd be
a good writer.

245
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:35,790
Last month you wanted to play violin.

246
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:39,170
Then you wanted to be
a ventriloquist.

247
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,670
Dad?

248
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,970
I love this guy.

249
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,510
- Dad
- What?

250
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,510
The money?

251
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,480
Maybe next summer.

252
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:56,320
<i>He forgot about the time
I wanted to be a magician.</i>

253
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:59,620
<i>I was really great
at making myself disappear.</i>

254
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,260
Want to play?

255
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:08,460
No, I've got to go
to a cemetery.

256
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,970
Keep your head up.

257
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,400
Don't look at the ball,
look at me.

258
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:17,170
See? You were lookin'
at the ball.

259
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,380
All right?
Keep your head up.

260
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:22,110
Gimme some skin.

261
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:21,410
Please!
Open the door, please!

262
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:24,030
Someone open the door!
Please!

263
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:26,300
Please, open the door!

264
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,180
<i>There he was just-a walkin'
down the street</i>

265
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:33,180
<i>Singin' "doo-wah diddy-diddy
dum-diddy-doo"</i>

266
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,910
<i>Poppin' his fingers
and shuffling his feet</i>

267
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,990
What happened?

268
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:44,050
My ball.
I lost my ball.

269
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,600
Come on.

270
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,330
Excuse me?

271
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,270
Could you take a look
at Mrs. Porter?

272
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:10,420
Didn't I give you
a picture of her?

273
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,490
You don't like it?

274
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,330
This was
the Reverend Porter's wife.

275
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,200
You have her looking
like a two-dollar hooker.

276
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,360
I think she looks nice.

277
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,000
Her lips are very thin.

278
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:31,630
I used the gloss
to give them a sensual quality.

279
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:35,580
And her eyes
just needed a little definition.

280
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:38,910
And her hair...
Nobody wears this hairdo in 1972.

281
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,320
She did.

282
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:43,350
This photo was taken a month ago
at the church food drive.

283
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:46,410
I wanted to get past
the schoolmarm image.

284
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,930
That wasn't an image.

285
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:51,290
She was an old schoolmarm.

286
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,130
Fix it.

287
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:04,140
I was just wondering...

288
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:06,180
if there is anything wrong
with Vada?

289
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,680
What do you mean?

290
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,150
- The other night...
- Oh, that. She likes to play.

291
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,880
I don't think so.

292
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:15,220
I think she's confused
about death.

293
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:18,520
She was raised in a funeral home.
She knows a little about it.

294
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,020
I really think...

295
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:22,580
She's a happy
eleven-year-old girl.

296
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:24,160
Look...

297
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:28,260
don't give me any advice
about my daughter, okay?

298
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:34,740
<i>Late last night
Not the night before</i>

299
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:37,540
<i>Twenty-four robbers
came a- knockin' at my door</i>

300
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:39,910
<i>As I went out
To let them in</i>

301
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:43,070
<i>This is what they told me
And this is what they said</i>

302
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:45,280
<i>Patty-cake, patty- cake
Turn around</i>

303
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,410
There's Shelly!

304
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:53,620
Can we look around
in your camper?

305
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:57,130
Sure. I'll give you
the royal tour.

306
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:10,470
This is the coolest thing.

307
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,370
You can really
eat and sleep here?

308
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,210
I'm going to drive us
to Liverpool.

309
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,150
Big Ringo fan.

310
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:22,750
- Would you like a soda?
- I would.

311
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:24,480
- Thomas?
- Yes, please.

312
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,520
What are you reading?

313
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,130
You shouldn't be looking at that.
It's too old for you.

314
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,470
Did you read
all these books?

315
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,970
What are they about?

316
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:45,770
Mostly love
and romance.

317
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:48,840
Gross.

318
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:51,640
They're just fun to read.

319
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,210
Here. Cheers.

320
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,650
Are you married?

321
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,920
No. I'm divorced.

322
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:04,360
Daddy says it's bad
when people get divorced.

323
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:06,490
I know.
Sometimes married people find out...

324
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:08,500
they can't live
with each other.

325
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:10,190
The Meyers are divorced.

326
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,630
Can I have a cookie?

327
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,500
Where are the cookies?

328
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,100
Well, I guess you found
my secret hiding place.

329
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,120
What are you saving for?

330
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:28,350
Nothing in particular.

331
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,150
Just for a rainy day.

332
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,990
I'm supposed to be home
at noon for lunch.

333
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,390
Thanks.

334
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,360
Bye.

335
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,400
Well.

336
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:45,530
- Let's head back.
- Can I use your bathroom?

337
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,230
- Sure.
- You don't have to wait.

338
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:49,240
Daddy will be mad
if you're late.

339
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:05,420
"The great way is not difficult
for those with no preferences.

340
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,050
With the absence
of both love and hate...

341
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,820
everything becomes clear
and undisguised."

342
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:16,490
That was written by a Chinese
philosopher in the year 600.

343
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:20,370
Why would I bring that up
in a creative writing class?

344
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:23,410
Because...

345
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:27,540
the absence of judgement
helps us to appreciate reality.

346
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:31,840
In other words, I want you to listen
to your classmates' writing...

347
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,180
with a clear
and open heart.

348
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,210
So, who's first?

349
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,760
I got one.

350
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:49,060
"I sang a song
for you to hear.

351
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:51,660
I painted a picture
for you to see.

352
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,230
I picked a rose
for you to smell.

353
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:57,070
I planted grass
for you to touch.

354
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,240
But you did not
hear my song.

355
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:02,080
You did not see
my picture.

356
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:06,310
You did not smell my rose,
and you did not touch my grass."

357
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,550
Maybe she was
out of town?

358
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,490
That's not funny.

359
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:12,390
His poem is about futility.

360
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:16,430
We toil
in unrewarded obscurity.

361
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:17,890
I hear judgment.

362
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,060
Let's not forget
the part about the open heart.

363
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:24,500
Is there something
I can do for you?

364
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:26,400
I paid the money.

365
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,600
For this class?

366
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:32,110
I want to be a writer.

367
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:38,470
But, Vada, this is
an adult writing class.

368
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:43,150
I think it's beautiful.
She wants to be a writer.

369
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,950
More power to you,
little sister.

370
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:49,020
You sure you want
to do this?

371
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:53,390
Welcome to the class.

372
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:56,090
Go find a seat.

373
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:04,110
Who's next?

374
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,640
I experienced something
with my boyfriend the other day...

375
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:08,650
and I wrote
a few words down.

376
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:10,310
The floor is yours, Ronda.

377
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:17,090
"He covers me
like a blanket...

378
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:20,850
from the cold,
dark night.

379
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,490
As I look into his eyes,
I know it's right.

380
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:29,230
To touch.
To feel.

381
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,770
I know he's real.

382
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,700
Flesh all a-mesh.

383
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:40,970
I can't fight it.

384
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:43,450
There's no point.

385
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,970
I wake up
and light a joint."

386
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,860
I wrote a poem, too.

387
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:03,200
Please.

388
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:08,170
"Ode to Ice Cream,"
by Vada Sultenfuss.

389
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,470
"I like ice cream a whole lot.
It tastes good when days are hot.

390
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:14,840
On a cone or in a dish,
this would be my only wish.

391
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:19,510
Vanilla, chocolate, rocky road,
even with pie a la mode.''

392
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,680
That's all I got so far.

393
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,620
I hear that.

394
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,090
"Flesh all a-mesh"
or "rocky road."

395
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,320
It's about desire.

396
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:32,860
It's very sweet
and it rhymes.

397
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:35,530
That's also good, but...

398
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:40,630
you're not expressing to me
what's in your soul.

399
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:43,730
I want you to show me
how you see the world.

400
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:46,870
Your fears,
your desires.

401
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:49,380
Your innermost secrets.

402
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:51,970
<i>My fears and secrets.</i>

403
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:54,880
<i>I'm afraid
I killed my mother.</i>

404
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:30,490
<i>Cannot do without</i>

405
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:33,610
<i>Harry's wild about me</i>

406
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:36,690
Excuse me, Harry.
I'm sorry.

407
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:40,700
The flowers were delivered,
and the room's all set up.

408
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:41,820
Thanks.

409
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,460
Listen, I want to apologize...

410
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,470
for the other day
about Vada.

411
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,630
I was harsh.

412
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:51,300
I shouldn't stick my nose
in other peoples' business.

413
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:53,310
It's just that
I like Vada very much.

414
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,210
After my wife died,
Gramoo moved in here...

415
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:00,220
to help us
take care of Vada.

416
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:02,050
They were very close.

417
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:05,750
But lately, as her mind's
been wandering more and more...

418
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,980
Vada's been acting
kind of crazy.

419
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:11,100
I'm sure she'll
snap out of it, though.

420
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,800
I'm sure she will.

421
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,670
Nothing's biting today.

422
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,500
Maybe they had
a big breakfast.

423
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:25,010
I'm going to be an acrobat
when I grow up.

424
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,440
Big deal. I can do that.
You got something.

425
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,810
Hurry!

426
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:35,410
I'm trying.

427
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:37,390
Reel it in.

428
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,570
It's a sunny.
Throw it back.

429
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:51,690
I don't like
touching fish.

430
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:54,600
I'll pull the hook out
without touching it.

431
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:56,230
You're hurting it.

432
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,610
Darn hook! I'm bleeding.
Did he get away?

433
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,350
Go look.

434
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,250
He got away.
Come on. Let's go.

435
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,350
We can become blood brothers.

436
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,160
I don't want to.

437
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:19,160
You could pick
that scab on your arm.

438
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:20,790
It's a mosquito bite.

439
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:22,660
It'll bleed.

440
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:25,070
If I do it,
can we go?

441
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:32,610
Rub them together.

442
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:38,410
We're blood brothers
for life.

443
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,190
Hi. What can I do
for you?

444
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,530
Nothing.

445
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:02,630
I was just wondering
what you were doing.

446
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:04,440
I'm just typing up
a funeral notice.

447
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:06,940
When someone dies,
we put one in the paper.

448
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:10,000
It's a service
we provide for the family.

449
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,850
Right.

450
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,210
"Bader, Lorenzo.

451
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,520
Died June 22, 1972.

452
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:22,790
Devoted husband to Nicolette.

453
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:27,090
Cherished father
of Fabrizio and Heidi.

454
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:31,360
In lieu of flowers, please send
donations to the Holy Name Society."

455
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,900
I wrote that.

456
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:35,910
No kidding?

457
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,870
It's good.
"In lieu of."

458
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,410
I love that word, "lieu."

459
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,040
I prefer it to " instead.''
It has more dignity.

460
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:45,740
"In lieu." "Instead."

461
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,980
No contest.

462
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:48,990
It's no big deal.

463
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,980
You have to learn
how to take a compliment.

464
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:54,320
"Movies.''

465
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,350
"Love Story'' at the drive-in.

466
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:01,900
Cried my eyes out.
Did you see it?

467
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,040
I haven't been
to the movies in ages.

468
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,040
I love to see movies.

469
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:09,400
Especially at the drive-in.

470
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:12,530
I don't think there's anything
more romantic than the drive-in.

471
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:19,180
I'll let you
get back to work.

472
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,680
I do enjoy
playing bingo.

473
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:31,460
If you'd like to join me
tomorrow night, you're welcome to.

474
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:52,770
- Are you going out somewhere?
- Nope.

475
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:56,790
- Why put on lipstick?
- A girl's always gotta look her best.

476
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:58,820
I think lipstick
looks fake.

477
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,250
No one's lips
are that color.

478
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,790
Have you ever tried any?

479
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:03,920
No.

480
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:06,090
Come here.
Sit down.

481
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:18,570
Go like this.

482
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,370
Little less.

483
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,040
All right.

484
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:29,340
Now first we blot.

485
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,990
Take a look.

486
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,790
It looks nice on you.

487
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:42,800
Do you think I'm pretty?

488
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:46,200
Yes.
I think you're very pretty.

489
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:48,470
You've got these
great, big...

490
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,800
sparkling eyes.

491
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,970
Cutest little nose.

492
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,710
An amazing mouth.

493
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:58,580
Boys at school
don't think I am.

494
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:00,140
They'll come around.

495
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:02,380
Close your eyes.

496
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:04,960
I want to bring out
the gorgeous color in them.

497
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:10,230
Now the first rule
in applying eye makeup...

498
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:13,630
is you can never wear
enough blue eye shadow.

499
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:16,260
Do you like putting makeup
on people?

500
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,040
I've been trying to get
to Hollywood...

501
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,300
to do makeup
for the movie stars, but...

502
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:25,710
I haven't gotten there yet.

503
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:32,840
All right.
Open your eyes.

504
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:41,720
I would definitely hold off
on that Hollywood thing.

505
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:57,100
- Your lip bleeding?
- No.

506
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:59,170
What's wrong
with your eyes?

507
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,370
A girl can never wear
enough eye shadow.

508
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:03,170
Where's your bike?

509
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:05,240
In the garage.

510
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,150
Walk me over.

511
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:14,020
It's only a garage.
Come on.

512
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:18,520
One of my streamers is gone.

513
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,590
It probably fell off
in here.

514
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:24,930
Look at this.

515
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,770
That was Gramoo's.

516
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,430
It's a phrenology chart.

517
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:30,770
They used to study
bumps on your head...

518
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,810
to see if you had
a good personality.

519
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:37,080
- I'll diagnose your head.
- I don't wanna.

520
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:40,170
Come on.
It's fun.

521
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:50,730
- Interesting.
- What?

522
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,730
You have no personality.

523
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,460
- Where does it say that?
- Never mind.

524
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,330
Is that your dad?

525
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:04,270
Who's that with your dad?

526
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:12,320
That's my mother.

527
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:15,050
- Do you remember her?
- No.

528
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,380
Gramoo said she's in heaven.

529
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:19,480
What do you think it's like?

530
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,390
- What?
- Heaven.

531
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:27,330
I think everybody gets
their own white horse.

532
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:31,300
All they do is ride
and eat marshmallows all day.

533
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:34,240
And everybody's best friends
with everybody else.

534
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:38,480
When you play sports,
there's no teams...

535
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:40,510
so nobody gets picked last.

536
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:43,270
But what if you're afraid
to ride horses?

537
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:47,780
It doesn't matter
They're not regular horses.

538
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:50,290
They got wings.

539
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:53,410
And it's no big deal
if you fall.

540
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,120
You just land in a cloud.

541
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:58,490
That doesn't sound so bad.
Come on.

542
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,830
We're gonna find
that streamer.

543
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:20,710
Well. What's going on in here?

544
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:22,080
Nothing.

545
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:23,620
I'm dressing.

546
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,150
You're dressing.

547
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:30,490
Don't you know
it's not nice to lie...

548
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:32,290
to your big brother?

549
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,860
- Watch the hair! The shirt!
- Give!

550
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:37,800
All right!

551
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,960
I'm going out with Shelly.

552
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,600
Yes! That's great.

553
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,470
- I'm very nervous.
- Why?

554
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:51,070
The last date I had
was 20 years ago.

555
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,480
True.

556
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:55,510
Sit down.

557
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,180
Let me fill you in
on today's woman.

558
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:03,260
Since the last time you dated,
something happened.

559
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,920
The sexual revolution.

560
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,730
Before, you had to hold a door
for a woman...

561
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,320
pull her chair out,
pick up the check.

562
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,870
No more.

563
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:15,960
You know what else is missing?
Bras.

564
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:19,740
- Oh, come on.
- I'm serious.

565
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:21,740
Trust me, Harry.

566
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:24,140
This women's lib thing is in.

567
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:26,650
You gotta treat her
like every Tom, Dick and Harry.

568
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,340
Are you sure?

569
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:31,410
Did you not tell Vada
I'm a womanizer?

570
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,290
I'm running late.

571
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:38,060
- Shelly will be here any minute.
- She's picking you up?

572
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:39,930
You're on
the right track.

573
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,760
She's just driving over.
We're taking my car.

574
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,700
How do I look?

575
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:50,040
Like a Sultenfuss.

576
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,630
Go get her.

577
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:57,740
'Night.

578
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,280
Why are you dressed up
to play bingo?

579
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:03,950
I want to look nice.

580
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,820
You never cared before.

581
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,860
Shelly's coming.
We're going together.

582
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:11,990
- Why?
- She likes to play bingo.

583
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,590
Can I go too?

584
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:16,460
No. You'd better
stay and keep Gramoo company.

585
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,710
<i>I've got to admit,
I'd as soon...</i>

586
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:05,720
<i>not have any more bounty prisoners
coming through Dodge any time soon.</i>

587
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,940
<i>It's a bit wearin'
on the nerves.</i>

588
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:12,350
<i>This day was starting off just fine,
and I'm gonna keep it that way.</i>

589
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:15,020
<i>Doc, you never
answered my question.</i>

590
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:26,060
- Where are you?
- Here.

591
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:29,330
- Don't do that.
- Sorry.

592
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:30,740
What do you want?

593
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:34,570
My mom will skin me
if she finds me out here.

594
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:36,880
Let's go to the church.
They're playing bingo.

595
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:38,880
I told you,
I'll get in trouble.

596
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:41,710
- Pacifist
- Am not.

597
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:45,120
- Bed wetter.
- I stopped that.

598
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,420
N-38.

599
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:50,020
Under the " N''...

600
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:52,790
Don't laugh.
There's a strategy to bingo.

601
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:55,530
For instance, on a given night,
anybody can win.

602
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,930
I play the odds.

603
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,970
When choosing bingo cards...

604
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:03,270
I use the laws of probabilities
to avoid duplicate number systems.

605
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,930
You get much more activity.

606
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:07,880
Does it make it easier
to win?

607
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:11,710
No. Just more activity.

608
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:15,120
<i>l- 1 7.
Under the "I," 1- 7.</i>

609
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:17,180
Hi, Carl, Vern.

610
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,580
They won't let us in.
We're kids.

611
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:23,320
We're not going to bet.
We're just going to watch.

612
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:26,190
Watch bingo?
I don't even like to play.

613
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,730
Duck.

614
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:32,270
<i>N- 4-2.</i>

615
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:34,800
<i>Under the "N," 4-2.</i>

616
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:36,500
Great!

617
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:38,170
There's your dad
and Shelly!

618
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,510
I don't want them
to see me.

619
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:43,140
3-7.

620
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:51,250
<i>B- 4.
Under the "B," 4.</i>

621
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:59,890
<i>O- 69.
Under the "O," 6-9.</i>

622
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:02,930
- I just had a terrible thought.
- What's that?

623
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:08,130
I'm going to be putting makeup
on some of these people soon.

624
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:11,140
Why do you think
these seats were empty?

625
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:14,380
B-6.

626
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:16,470
Under the "B," 6.

627
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:18,670
- Can we go yet?
- Go!

628
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:22,190
I'm not allowed
out by myself after dark.

629
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:27,380
I'm just not lucky.

630
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:29,320
It's not always luck.

631
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:30,880
Depending upon the numbers...

632
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,060
a guy with ten cards can win
as easily as a guy with a hundred.

633
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:36,960
Kind of like men.

634
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:39,500
How do you mean?

635
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:42,370
You can be in a room
with 100 men...

636
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:45,140
and not like any of them.

637
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:48,840
Or you can be in a room
with just one man.

638
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:51,210
He's exactly
the one you want.

639
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:01,220
Bingo!

640
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:06,960
We have a winner.
Will the winner raise their hand?

641
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:10,160
There was no bingo.
It came from outside.

642
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:12,600
How could someone outside
get a bingo?

643
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:15,400
Someone outside
didn't get a bingo.

644
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:19,240
Someone outside yelled "bingo,"
you moron!

645
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:22,210
- Who are you calling a moron?
- Put a lid on it.

646
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:27,180
If you weren't 200 years old,
I'd kick your wrinkled ass!

647
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:28,740
Fellows!

648
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:30,910
- It's only bingo!
- We can go.

649
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:36,250
Cards and bad prizes.
A cheap clock, some ugly glassware.

650
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:27,270
I had a good time tonight.

651
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:30,510
I haven't had
a bingo partner in ages.

652
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:38,080
Would you like to see my house?
Just for a minute?

653
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,970
Home sweet home.

654
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,670
It's nice.

655
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:58,710
I did it myself.

656
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:02,710
I read a magazine article
about how to maximize small spaces.

657
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:05,910
Well, it certainly
looks bigger than it seems.

658
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:09,310
You can look in the bathroom,
if you want.

659
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:11,410
People are always
curious about that.

660
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,250
Like what happens
when you flush.

661
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,930
Are you mad at me?

662
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:32,770
No. Why?

663
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:37,380
I don't know.
You just seemed a little cool.

664
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:40,140
Not opening car doors...

665
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:43,650
That was Phil's
advice on dating 70s women.

666
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:46,950
I'm out of touch.
I haven't dated in ages.

667
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:49,030
Not since my wife died.

668
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:51,530
What happened to her?

669
00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:57,360
Complications during childbirth.

670
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:00,930
She died two days
after Vada was born.

671
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:04,610
Did she ever see Vada?

672
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,970
I brought the baby
into the room...

673
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:12,350
a couple of times.

674
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:14,940
She opened her eyes.

675
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:18,310
I think she saw Vada.

676
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:22,760
It was...

677
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:27,160
Did I ruin this?

678
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:31,020
Dance with me?

679
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:33,540
Here?

680
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,440
This is where we are.

681
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:42,040
Is there enough room?

682
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:48,120
- I haven't danced...
- In ages.

683
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:50,680
I know. Me neither.

684
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:00,860
Bra?

685
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,600
See? You're not that
out of touch.

686
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:12,440
You're good.

687
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:17,140
At Woodman High,
I was considered a hot date.

688
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:20,050
I did a killer Trug.

689
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:27,190
What are you wearing?

690
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:28,880
Old Spice.

691
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:31,550
Phil says
it's a timeless classic.

692
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:50,170
So do you want to?

693
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:52,680
Want to what?

694
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:54,010
Kiss me.

695
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,350
- Yes.
- Good.

696
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:11,070
Good at kissing
and dancing.

697
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:13,830
I'm very optimistic.

698
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:24,610
I'd better go.

699
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:27,710
It's only a clock.

700
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:30,010
Good night.

701
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:37,750
Well.

702
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:40,420
I guess it's official.
We had a date.

703
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,490
Maybe we can play bingo
again sometime?

704
00:48:42,570 --> 00:48:45,560
I'm tired of bingo.

705
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:48,570
Maybe we should try
that drive-in of yours.

706
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:52,040
Good night.

707
00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:14,700
Before class started...

708
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:19,030
Ronda and Justin wanted to lead
the class in a group meditation.

709
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:21,430
That's really cool.

710
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:27,240
What we're going to do is
send our vibes out into the group.

711
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:33,150
Everybody hold hands...

712
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,650
and close your eyes.

713
00:49:36,290 --> 00:49:41,120
Relax your muscles
and take deep breaths.

714
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:46,160
Now try to feel...

715
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:50,790
what the other person is feeling
without speaking any words.

716
00:49:51,870 --> 00:49:53,890
Send out your vibe...

717
00:49:53,970 --> 00:49:57,700
and receive the vibes from around you
at the same time.

718
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:00,380
Can you feel it?

719
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:06,510
Open your eyes.
What did everybody feel?

720
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:09,710
I felt Mrs. Hunsaker's strength.

721
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:13,050
I can feel that Ronda
is one with the earth.

722
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,450
She's so cosmically in tune.

723
00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:19,690
So right on.
That's exactly what I sent out.

724
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,990
And I felt like you were full...

725
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:24,230
of inner peace and harmony.

726
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:28,370
Vada, what did you feel?

727
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:32,270
- I felt Justin's hangnail.
- No, Vada.

728
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:34,570
That's not what we're looking for.

729
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,240
A hangnail is insignificant.

730
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,610
What's in my soul...

731
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:43,020
feel my aura.

732
00:50:43,090 --> 00:50:45,680
I don't think I'm allowed to.

733
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:49,260
Tell you what.
Let's try it again.

734
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:52,260
Hold hands.

735
00:50:54,730 --> 00:50:57,170
<i>Gramoo once had a hangnail
on her big toe.</i>

736
00:50:57,230 --> 00:50:59,960
<i>It got infecfed and traveled
to her vocal chords.</i>

737
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:01,800
<i>Ruined her singing voice.</i>

738
00:51:01,870 --> 00:51:05,330
<i>I don't think Gramoo
thought it was insignificant.</i>

739
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,470
And some lettuce.

740
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:09,440
Watch out for the rust
when you get lettuce.

741
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:13,910
I thought I recognized you two.

742
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:19,980
We're just picking things up
for the barbecue.

743
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:22,580
Me too.
Mind if I tag along?

744
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:25,140
Not at all.

745
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:29,850
- A lot of potatoes.
- It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.

746
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:33,290
I'm looking forward to that.
Damn it!

747
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:36,800
- Watch what you're doing!
- Sorry.

748
00:52:38,370 --> 00:52:40,860
This'll be my first July 4th picnic
in a long time.

749
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:45,200
Dad, didn't you say you needed prunes
real bad?

750
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,540
Just put anything you want
in the cart.

751
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:51,650
I don't know
what's gotten in to her today.

752
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,450
I need olives.

753
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:58,210
<i>I used to like to play
with my Ken and Barbie dolls.</i>

754
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:01,780
<i>Ken was my favorite.
Then one Christmas, I got them a camper.</i>

755
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:04,360
<i>All they wanted to do
was hang out by themselves.</i>

756
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:08,690
<i>So I wasn't too upset when they took
that wrong turn and went over the cliff.</i>

757
00:53:08,770 --> 00:53:12,670
<i>Gave proof through the night</i>

758
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:16,760
<i>That our flag was still there</i>

759
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:21,680
<i>Oh, say does that star-spangled</i>

760
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:26,340
<i>Banner yet wave</i>

761
00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:56,610
I told you, use fewer briquettes.
Now look what you've done.

762
00:53:56,680 --> 00:54:00,280
- You've cremated them.
- That's what I do.

763
00:54:00,350 --> 00:54:01,940
Do you want to do it?

764
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:04,990
Why don't you pre-measure the briquettes
in little packages?

765
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:07,110
Put out a product.
Support me a while.

766
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:08,920
How's it going, chef?

767
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:11,990
- I love your apron.
- Thanks.

768
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:15,660
- Is it ready yet?
- No, sweetie. Not yet.

769
00:54:15,730 --> 00:54:18,260
- When.
- Soon, honey.

770
00:54:18,330 --> 00:54:20,270
- When?
- In a minute.

771
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:23,270
It's hot. You'll burn your nose.
Look out.

772
00:54:29,810 --> 00:54:32,750
- Just a minute, Mom.
- Dinner!

773
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:38,590
<i>Rub-a-dub-dub...</i>

774
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:40,180
thanks for the grub.

775
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:43,420
- Yea, God.
- I'll second that.

776
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:44,930
Shelly, like seafood?

777
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,330
Why?

778
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,390
"See food."

779
00:54:48,470 --> 00:54:50,330
That's attractive.

780
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,300
Shit.
Excuse me.

781
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:01,540
Hey, who lives here?
The Addams family?

782
00:55:01,610 --> 00:55:05,010
- Danny, what are you doing here?
- What am I doing here?

783
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:08,310
Hi, Ralph.
Danny, how'd you find me?

784
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:11,880
You told everybody where you were going.
I'm here for the motor home.

785
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:14,980
These two people
do not have a good relationship.

786
00:55:15,090 --> 00:55:17,560
I've been living in it.
The camper is mine!

787
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:20,130
"Mutual asset."
That's what the lawyer said.

788
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:21,860
It's supposed to be ours.

789
00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:24,990
- Not Shelly's recreational vehicle.
- Would you keep your voice down!

790
00:55:25,070 --> 00:55:27,000
My boss is watching us.

791
00:55:27,070 --> 00:55:29,400
I'm impressed.

792
00:55:29,470 --> 00:55:33,170
- I guess I have to introduce you now.
- All right.

793
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:43,220
Vada Sultenfuss?
Tough break.

794
00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:45,480
I like my name.

795
00:55:45,590 --> 00:55:49,180
This is Danny and Ralph. They own
the Dino Raphael Salon in Detroit.

796
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:51,490
We were married.

797
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:53,530
Are you here to take her back?

798
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:59,000
Nice to meet you. We've got burgers
and hot dogs, if you'd care to join us.

799
00:55:59,070 --> 00:56:03,700
- Can't stay. I'm here because my wife...
- Ex!

800
00:56:03,770 --> 00:56:07,000
My ex-wife seems to have ripped off
my camper.

801
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:10,270
Honestly, he got the Mustang.

802
00:56:10,350 --> 00:56:11,970
- I promise...
- I don't think so.

803
00:56:12,050 --> 00:56:14,350
I've got a copy
of the property settlement here.

804
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:17,480
Shit! This is my lease.

805
00:56:17,590 --> 00:56:20,680
Damn it. I keep forgetting things.
Getting senile.

806
00:56:21,830 --> 00:56:23,590
What?

807
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:27,030
I know you've suffered
a terrible loss...

808
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:29,890
and there's nothing
anyone can do to comfort you.

809
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:34,490
I urge you to focus on the times
you had with the camper...

810
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:37,130
the trips you took,
the sights you saw.

811
00:56:37,210 --> 00:56:39,940
Those days are gone, but they'll live on
in your heart forever.

812
00:56:40,810 --> 00:56:42,400
Is he boinking you?

813
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:45,850
That's a real bonehead thing to say!

814
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,940
You're not gonna take her camper.

815
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:50,780
- Oh, no?
- It's her home. It's where she lives.

816
00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:53,080
Really? Fine. Go cook.

817
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:55,180
- Give me the goddamn keys!
- That hurts!

818
00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:00,160
What you do that for?

819
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:02,320
- Who are you?
- I'm his brother.

820
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:06,930
- Then you'll be visiting us quite often.
- Why?

821
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,530
Because if he ever tries to take
Shelly's camper again...

822
00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:11,730
I'm gonna bury him in my front yard.

823
00:57:16,710 --> 00:57:18,680
Your father's a savage.

824
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:22,380
Bye, Ralph.

825
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:31,250
Well, you were pretty great.

826
00:57:31,330 --> 00:57:33,590
Is it really your camper?

827
00:57:43,770 --> 00:57:47,400
- Can we see them from the back yard?
- You can get the general idea.

828
00:57:51,210 --> 00:57:52,940
There they are.

829
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:55,380
They always look the same every year.

830
00:57:56,850 --> 00:57:58,320
Look.

831
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:04,280
Did you love him?

832
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:12,000
I would never marry anybody
I didn't love.

833
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:16,500
He must like Shelly.

834
00:58:16,570 --> 00:58:19,410
I never saw him hit anyone in his life.

835
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,540
He likes her.

836
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:26,240
Does he love her?

837
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,750
Probably.

838
00:58:30,290 --> 00:58:32,520
Do you like her?

839
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:34,560
Yes, I do.

840
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:37,220
I think she's very good for your father.

841
00:58:37,330 --> 00:58:38,760
Why?

842
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:42,890
After your mother died,
he was sad all the time.

843
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:47,430
But before that,
he was pretty funny.

844
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:48,940
Really?

845
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:55,200
Now when I see him with Shelly...

846
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:58,910
sometimes he seems like
the old Harry.

847
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:00,920
My dad was funny?

848
00:59:02,490 --> 00:59:06,890
He wasn't one of the Marx Brothers,
but made me laugh.

849
00:59:10,030 --> 00:59:12,090
<i>My uncle fought in the Korean War.</i>

850
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,490
<i>He had a steel plate
put in his head.</i>

851
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:16,900
<i>Daddy said he didn't come back
the same.</i>

852
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:21,800
<i>One night, we picked up a radio station
from Oklahoma in his teeth.</i>

853
00:59:21,870 --> 00:59:23,810
<i>It was really neat.</i>

854
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:32,370
- What?
- Can't you see it?

855
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:34,510
- No.
- It's there.

856
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:37,350
There is no chicken bone
stuck in your throat.

857
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:41,390
Dr. Welty,
are you sure those are yours?

858
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:46,090
So you fill it with water, like this.

859
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,890
And what have you got?
A water gun.

860
00:59:48,970 --> 00:59:51,060
Cool.
Can I get one for Vada?

861
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:56,160
Let me ask you a question.

862
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:58,900
Does Vada tell you
why she comes here so much?

863
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:01,540
- She's dying.
- Do you think she is?

864
01:00:02,710 --> 01:00:04,440
Why do you think she says that?

865
01:00:04,510 --> 01:00:07,070
She scared of all those dead people
in her house.

866
01:00:07,150 --> 01:00:10,590
You know that saying, " If you can't
beat them, join them''?

867
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:13,210
If she's one of them,
she won't be as scared.

868
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:17,760
You know what I think? She's very lucky
to have a friend like you.

869
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:20,190
She's my best friend.

870
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:23,260
Miss Vada, how are you feeling?

871
01:00:24,330 --> 01:00:26,800
As good as can be expected.

872
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:31,030
- Guess what we got?
- What?

873
01:00:31,110 --> 01:00:35,410
- This!
- Hey, you! I'm gonna get you!

874
01:00:37,110 --> 01:00:38,550
Give me that!

875
01:00:41,450 --> 01:00:45,050
- I just got you.
- You didn't.

876
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:47,420
- Whoa.
- What?

877
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:50,080
- There's a bee hive.
- So?

878
01:00:50,190 --> 01:00:52,130
Stand back.

879
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:56,560
Are you crazy?
You'll get stung!

880
01:00:56,630 --> 01:00:58,260
You're right.
Let's knock it down.

881
01:00:58,330 --> 01:01:01,860
- What do you want if for, anyway?
- 'Cause they're neat.

882
01:01:09,510 --> 01:01:10,770
Got it!

883
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:15,140
My mood ring fell off!
I gotta find it!

884
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:24,490
They're alive!
Run for your life!

885
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:41,270
- Run faster! They're after us!
- I am running faster.

886
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:43,740
- Hurry!
- Jump in the water!

887
01:01:43,810 --> 01:01:46,280
- I have my clothes on!
- Do it!

888
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:04,090
- Vada, is that you?
- Yes.

889
01:02:04,170 --> 01:02:06,930
Guess what? We're going
to the carnival tonight.

890
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,440
Be ready to go in 10 minutes.

891
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:12,130
Shelly's coming with us.

892
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:26,380
- Vada, what's your favorite ride?
- I like the freak show.

893
01:02:26,490 --> 01:02:31,520
I know. Let's go on
the "sit on the bench and rest ride."

894
01:02:31,630 --> 01:02:34,760
I don't think that roller coaster
agreed with your dad's stomach.

895
01:02:34,830 --> 01:02:36,860
You have to watch what you eat here.

896
01:02:36,930 --> 01:02:40,160
Once I went to a carnival
with my cousins, David and Frank.

897
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:43,570
They ate hot dogs, and the next day
came down with nephritis.

898
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:47,630
Nephritis is a kidney disease.
You don't get it from hot dogs.

899
01:02:47,710 --> 01:02:51,410
All I know is,
the next day they had high fevers...

900
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:53,950
and their faces got very fat.

901
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:56,610
It baffled medical science.
They were in a magazine.

902
01:02:58,450 --> 01:03:02,820
The were! "Popular Mechanics"...
No, "Popular Science."

903
01:03:02,930 --> 01:03:05,050
I don't know. It was "Popular."

904
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:09,890
- They're trying to hit that poor thing!
- Watch you don't knock out a fish.

905
01:03:09,970 --> 01:03:11,900
Just arc it.

906
01:03:15,070 --> 01:03:17,200
I don't know which ball's mine.

907
01:03:17,270 --> 01:03:20,400
- I won!
- Great!

908
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,970
We have a winner!
There you go, little girl.

909
01:03:23,050 --> 01:03:25,010
See how easy it is?

910
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:27,110
That's a gorgeous goldfish.

911
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:30,410
Where'd you get that ring?

912
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:35,150
Did you win it?

913
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:43,060
We have something to tell you.

914
01:03:49,870 --> 01:03:51,810
We have some good news.

915
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:53,900
We're getting married.

916
01:03:56,850 --> 01:03:58,470
My fish!

917
01:04:01,850 --> 01:04:04,980
We're having the wedding
sometime near the end of the summer.

918
01:04:05,090 --> 01:04:08,610
You'll be okay, little fish.

919
01:04:10,590 --> 01:04:12,490
Should we get you another goldfish?

920
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:15,990
No. He's fine.

921
01:04:17,470 --> 01:04:20,870
Fish are very resilient animals.

922
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:23,460
Don't worry.
I won't get another fish.

923
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:28,500
The bumper car!

924
01:04:30,010 --> 01:04:33,950
For just 50 cents... a half dollar...
five dimes... ten nickels...

925
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:38,250
we have a ride guaranteed to rearrange
all of your internal organs.

926
01:04:38,350 --> 01:04:41,980
Don't pass me by.
That's the bumper car ride!

927
01:04:42,090 --> 01:04:46,260
Bumper cars! You can't go to a carnival
and not ride them!

928
01:04:46,330 --> 01:04:48,730
I'd fall asleep at the wheel.

929
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,730
I'll ride them with you.

930
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,730
Great!
Come on.

931
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:58,830
I got the blue one!

932
01:05:04,350 --> 01:05:06,320
I'm gonna come get you.

933
01:05:14,290 --> 01:05:16,350
Veda, keep your hands on the wheel.

934
01:05:54,930 --> 01:05:56,760
Careful!

935
01:05:57,830 --> 01:05:59,030
Look out!

936
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:35,030
- Can Thomas J. come out?
- Sure. Come in.

937
01:06:39,110 --> 01:06:41,010
- Wanna ride bikes?
- Sure.

938
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:44,640
- Did you make your bed?
- Yes.

939
01:06:44,710 --> 01:06:46,940
- You're sure?
- It's made.

940
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:50,380
Come here.
You've got a milk moustache.

941
01:06:52,790 --> 01:06:54,480
Let's go.

942
01:06:56,390 --> 01:06:58,790
- Bye, Mom.
- Have fun, kids.

943
01:07:01,930 --> 01:07:06,300
- I'm running away.
- Where are you running to?

944
01:07:06,370 --> 01:07:10,360
California. I'm going to Hollywood
to live with the Brady Bunch.

945
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:13,470
- I wanna live with them too.
- You can't.

946
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:18,140
They have enough kids. You'll have
to live with the Partridge Family.

947
01:07:18,210 --> 01:07:19,980
Really?

948
01:07:34,830 --> 01:07:36,760
That's it.

949
01:07:46,780 --> 01:07:49,180
- Get up.
- I'm tired of running away.

950
01:07:49,250 --> 01:07:53,940
Besides, we passed this place twice.
We're not getting nowhere.

951
01:07:57,090 --> 01:08:01,490
- Why are you running away?
- My dad gave Shelly a ring.

952
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:03,820
Wow! Was it a decoder ring?

953
01:08:03,890 --> 01:08:07,850
You're such a retard.
It was an engagement ring.

954
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:11,760
They're getting married?
Now you have a mother.

955
01:08:11,830 --> 01:08:15,600
- I don't like her.
- I do. She's real funny.

956
01:08:16,540 --> 01:08:18,910
He likes her better than me.

957
01:08:24,810 --> 01:08:28,720
- I'm hungry. I can't last any longer.
- Then go home, baby.

958
01:08:28,780 --> 01:08:31,250
I have to anyway.
My mom will be worried.

959
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:33,720
Leave, then.
Some friend you are.

960
01:08:33,820 --> 01:08:36,350
You can come to my house for dinner.

961
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:38,590
No. I'm hiding out.

962
01:08:38,690 --> 01:08:40,890
See you.

963
01:09:38,820 --> 01:09:40,790
<i>Are the gentlemen
going to stay or not?</i>

964
01:09:43,630 --> 01:09:45,890
Perhaps you didn't hear what I said.

965
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:48,830
<i>The whole Circle fortune
goes to you.</i>

966
01:09:48,900 --> 01:09:51,870
<i>- Twenty million dollars.
- I heard you, all right.</i>

967
01:09:51,930 --> 01:09:53,960
<i>That's quite a lot, isn't it?</i>

968
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:57,840
<i>- It'll do in a pinch.
- I wonder why he left me all that money.</i>

969
01:09:57,910 --> 01:09:59,970
<i>I don't need it.</i>

970
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:06,380
<i>In school, we learned some people stole
the Lindbergh baby out of his house.</i>

971
01:10:06,450 --> 01:10:09,820
<i>I think I'll sleep
with my window open tonight.</i>

972
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:15,720
Oh, my God!

973
01:10:15,820 --> 01:10:17,820
Daddy!

974
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:29,230
What's the matter?

975
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:31,530
- Where's Daddy?
- He just left. What's wrong?

976
01:10:31,610 --> 01:10:33,970
- I'm hemorrhaging.
- What do you mean?

977
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:35,770
I don't want or need your help!

978
01:10:36,850 --> 01:10:38,640
Did this happen in the bathroom?

979
01:10:40,450 --> 01:10:42,750
- How old are you?
- Eleven and a half.

980
01:10:43,590 --> 01:10:46,750
It's okay.
Come upstairs. We have to talk.

981
01:10:49,530 --> 01:10:52,490
My mommy and daddy did that?

982
01:10:52,590 --> 01:10:55,030
It's actually a very beautiful thing.

983
01:10:56,730 --> 01:10:58,500
There wouldn't have been a Veda.

984
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:00,560
I think it should be outlawed.

985
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:03,330
Believe me.
Someday, you'll feel differently.

986
01:11:04,610 --> 01:11:07,400
That's probably Thomas J.
I don't want to see him.

987
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:13,770
It's not fair.
Nothing happens to boys.

988
01:11:17,150 --> 01:11:19,380
Hi. Can you come out?

989
01:11:19,490 --> 01:11:21,960
- I don't know.
- Please!

990
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:24,750
It's real hot.
Maybe we can go swimming.

991
01:11:26,660 --> 01:11:29,260
No! Get out of here!

992
01:11:30,770 --> 01:11:34,130
And don't come back
for five to seven days!

993
01:11:51,350 --> 01:11:54,910
I'm going to the bathroom.
I'll be right back.

994
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:58,820
Stay here.

995
01:12:55,850 --> 01:12:58,380
<i>It's quarter to three</i>

996
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:01,650
<i>There's no one in the place</i>

997
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:04,320
<i>Just you and me</i>

998
01:13:04,430 --> 01:13:07,420
<i>So set them up, Joe</i>

999
01:13:07,530 --> 01:13:11,760
<i>I've got a little story
you ought to know</i>

1000
01:13:12,730 --> 01:13:15,030
<i>We're coming, my friend</i>

1001
01:13:16,310 --> 01:13:20,740
<i>- To the end of brief episode
- I'm so sorry.</i>

1002
01:13:20,810 --> 01:13:25,340
<i>- So make it one for my baby
- All right. It's okay.</i>

1003
01:13:25,410 --> 01:13:29,440
<i>- And one more for the road
- Very, very sorry.</i>

1004
01:13:34,090 --> 01:13:36,580
What were you thinking?

1005
01:13:36,690 --> 01:13:38,660
It's your responsibility to watch her!

1006
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:42,560
Do you have any idea
how upset those people are in there?

1007
01:13:56,310 --> 01:13:59,280
Why do you think people
want to get married?

1008
01:13:59,350 --> 01:14:02,440
When you get older,
you just have to.

1009
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:04,950
I'm going to marry Mr. Bixler.

1010
01:14:05,020 --> 01:14:07,890
You can't marry a teacher.
It's against the law.

1011
01:14:07,990 --> 01:14:10,080
- It is not.
- Yes, it is.

1012
01:14:10,190 --> 01:14:13,250
'Cause then he'll give you all A's,
and it won't be fair.

1013
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:15,300
Not true.

1014
01:14:18,430 --> 01:14:20,090
Have you ever kissed anyone?

1015
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:23,540
Like they do on TV?

1016
01:14:28,610 --> 01:14:31,810
Maybe we should, just to see
what's the big deal.

1017
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:34,680
I don't know how.

1018
01:14:34,750 --> 01:14:36,740
Here. Practice on your arm,
like this.

1019
01:14:37,820 --> 01:14:39,980
Like this?

1020
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:46,690
Enough practice.
Close your eyes.

1021
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:48,700
Then I won't be able to see anything.

1022
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:50,890
Just do it.

1023
01:14:55,570 --> 01:14:57,730
On the count of three.

1024
01:14:58,670 --> 01:15:00,340
One.

1025
01:15:00,410 --> 01:15:03,640
Two.
Two-and-a-half.

1026
01:15:03,710 --> 01:15:05,910
Three.

1027
01:15:13,190 --> 01:15:16,280
Say something.
It's too quiet.

1028
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:21,160
Just hurry!

1029
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:24,660
"I pledge allegiance
to the flag...

1030
01:15:24,730 --> 01:15:26,700
of the United States of America.

1031
01:15:26,770 --> 01:15:29,330
And to the republic
for which it stands...

1032
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:31,430
one nation, under God...

1033
01:15:31,510 --> 01:15:34,810
indivisible,
with liberty and justice for all."

1034
01:15:56,730 --> 01:15:59,790
- You better not tell anyone.
- You better not either.

1035
01:15:59,870 --> 01:16:02,130
Well, let's spit on it.

1036
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:07,010
- See you tomorrow.
- See you.

1037
01:16:09,410 --> 01:16:11,240
What?

1038
01:16:12,380 --> 01:16:15,210
- Would you think of me?
- For what?

1039
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:19,310
If you don't marry Mr. Bixler.

1040
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:23,020
I guess.

1041
01:17:25,090 --> 01:17:26,650
Get away!

1042
01:18:17,770 --> 01:18:20,800
- What are you doing?
- Feeding my fish.

1043
01:18:25,310 --> 01:18:28,110
Is that the fish you won
at the carnival?

1044
01:18:31,450 --> 01:18:33,390
He's getting big.

1045
01:18:37,530 --> 01:18:40,150
Come here and sit down for a minute.

1046
01:18:46,170 --> 01:18:48,500
Something happened to Thomas J.
last night.

1047
01:18:50,770 --> 01:18:52,740
He stepped on a beehive.

1048
01:18:52,810 --> 01:18:57,180
I told him not to tease those bees.
Did he get stung?

1049
01:19:01,050 --> 01:19:03,450
Maybe I should go over and yell at him.

1050
01:19:05,690 --> 01:19:08,210
No, sweetheart.
You can't.

1051
01:19:11,430 --> 01:19:12,890
Why not?

1052
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:18,530
He was allergic to bees.

1053
01:19:19,770 --> 01:19:22,200
He's okay, isn't he?

1054
01:19:24,210 --> 01:19:26,440
There were just too many of them.

1055
01:19:48,730 --> 01:19:50,700
What's wrong, sweetheart?

1056
01:19:50,770 --> 01:19:54,460
- I can't breath. I'm suffocating.
- Relax. Let me look.

1057
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:56,560
It's okay.
Come up here. Let me have a look.

1058
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:58,570
That's a girl.

1059
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:00,610
It hurts so bad!

1060
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:04,080
- Make it stop!
- What hurts?

1061
01:20:05,150 --> 01:20:08,310
The bee stings!
I can't breathe!

1062
01:20:37,410 --> 01:20:40,310
I'm leaving some food by the door
in case you get hungry.

1063
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:49,810
Is Veda home?

1064
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:54,590
She is. But she's very upset
so she's not seeing anyone.

1065
01:20:55,660 --> 01:20:57,790
I'm Judy.
I go to school with her.

1066
01:20:57,870 --> 01:21:00,560
I wanted to tell her
I'm sorry about Thomas J.

1067
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:03,790
Maybe she'll feel better
in a couple days.

1068
01:21:03,870 --> 01:21:05,200
Will you tell her I came by?

1069
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:08,600
- Sure.
- Thank you.

1070
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:10,270
Bye.

1071
01:21:17,690 --> 01:21:19,480
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi, Reverend Moss.

1072
01:21:19,590 --> 01:21:23,460
I know the Sennetts want to thank you
for taking care of things so quickly.

1073
01:21:35,270 --> 01:21:37,470
I see you took your tray in.

1074
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:41,580
Maybe you should come down
for the funeral.

1075
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:43,740
Sometimes it helps.

1076
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:56,360
She won't come out.

1077
01:21:57,790 --> 01:21:59,520
It's been a whole day.

1078
01:22:01,060 --> 01:22:03,760
You have to do something.

1079
01:22:03,830 --> 01:22:09,030
- The funeral's starting.
- She's 11 years old!

1080
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:11,040
Her only friend is dead!

1081
01:22:11,110 --> 01:22:13,100
I know!
What do you want from me?

1082
01:22:13,170 --> 01:22:15,440
Stop hiding!

1083
01:22:15,510 --> 01:22:17,480
You run.

1084
01:22:18,550 --> 01:22:23,450
When I came here, the idea of working
with dead people didn't thrill me.

1085
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:27,820
When I saw a family lived here...

1086
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:31,690
I thought...

1087
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:36,700
if I'm living without a family,
at least I can work with one.

1088
01:22:36,770 --> 01:22:40,200
And maybe, once and a while,
be invited for supper.

1089
01:22:40,270 --> 01:22:44,360
And when those suppers are disrupted
when there's a car crash...

1090
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:46,370
or a little boy
steps on a beehive...

1091
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:50,380
I'm not asking you to stop feeling
for those people.

1092
01:22:52,750 --> 01:22:54,910
But life isn't just death.

1093
01:22:56,990 --> 01:22:58,850
Don't ignore the living.

1094
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:02,550
Especially your daughter.

1095
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:08,420
Excuse me.
The minister's about to begin.

1096
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:11,190
Thank you, Arthur.

1097
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:27,410
We are here to...

1098
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:29,850
honor Thomas James Sennett.

1099
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:33,910
He was born May 7, 1961...

1100
01:23:34,020 --> 01:23:35,680
in Madison, Pennsylvania.

1101
01:23:35,790 --> 01:23:37,760
He's survived by his loving parents...

1102
01:23:37,830 --> 01:23:39,760
Charles and Susan Sennett...

1103
01:23:39,830 --> 01:23:43,030
his grandparents,
William and Gloria Sennett...

1104
01:23:43,100 --> 01:23:45,070
and Gerald and Marjory Finn...

1105
01:23:45,130 --> 01:23:48,760
and many relatives, friends
and schoolmates.

1106
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:53,070
The internment will follow
at Madison Memorial Park.

1107
01:23:53,140 --> 01:23:57,740
The family has asked me
to say a few words before we proceed.

1108
01:24:00,180 --> 01:24:03,810
No words I could say
would begin to express...

1109
01:24:03,890 --> 01:24:06,220
the loss and grief.

1110
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:10,880
One word that keeps ringing in my ear...

1111
01:24:10,990 --> 01:24:12,430
is "why?"

1112
01:24:12,490 --> 01:24:15,490
Why would God choose
to take this little boy from us?

1113
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:20,320
Why? I cant give you an answer
to that question.

1114
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:21,830
I can tell you...

1115
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:26,100
God has chosen Thomas J.
for some very special reason.

1116
01:24:27,940 --> 01:24:32,640
We must find solace in knowing
that he's in God's care.

1117
01:24:32,710 --> 01:24:37,520
In that place,
there is no sorrow or suffering.

1118
01:24:37,590 --> 01:24:39,850
The lion lies with the lamb.

1119
01:24:39,950 --> 01:24:42,890
The day is not divided.

1120
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:46,050
I'd like to read a passage
from the Bible.

1121
01:24:47,660 --> 01:24:50,530
This is Matthew 19.

1122
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:52,620
At one point, children were
brought to Him...

1123
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:57,070
that He might lay his hands on them
in prayer.

1124
01:24:57,140 --> 01:24:59,040
Disciples began to chastise Him.

1125
01:25:00,070 --> 01:25:04,480
But Jesus said,
"Let the children come to me.

1126
01:25:04,550 --> 01:25:06,310
Do not hinder them.

1127
01:25:06,380 --> 01:25:09,350
The kingdom of God
belongs to such as these."

1128
01:25:11,190 --> 01:25:14,180
He laid his hands on their heads...

1129
01:25:14,290 --> 01:25:16,280
before he left that place.

1130
01:25:16,390 --> 01:25:19,450
Let us pray in silence.

1131
01:25:20,900 --> 01:25:23,590
Wanna go tree climbing?

1132
01:25:23,670 --> 01:25:27,120
His face hurts!
And where are his glasses?

1133
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:29,900
He can't see without his glasses!

1134
01:25:29,970 --> 01:25:31,910
Put his glasses on!

1135
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:40,710
- He was going to be an acrobat.
- He's gone, sweetheart.

1136
01:25:45,820 --> 01:25:47,450
Wait!

1137
01:26:03,610 --> 01:26:06,200
I was just on my way to your house.

1138
01:26:06,270 --> 01:26:09,540
You all right?
I'm so sorry about Thomas J.

1139
01:26:11,380 --> 01:26:13,680
We don't have to talk about him!

1140
01:26:16,180 --> 01:26:18,150
It's okay.
We won't talk about him.

1141
01:26:18,220 --> 01:26:22,020
Justin and Ronda say that I should
tell people what I feel.

1142
01:26:22,990 --> 01:26:25,520
Come here.
Sit down over here.

1143
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:33,370
I love you.

1144
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:38,000
I love you like my dad loves Shelly.

1145
01:26:38,070 --> 01:26:40,010
And I wanna live here.

1146
01:26:43,210 --> 01:26:45,480
I think your dad would miss you.

1147
01:26:45,550 --> 01:26:48,740
No, he wouldn't.
I can't go home.

1148
01:26:48,820 --> 01:26:52,840
Hank, I'll be ready in a second.
I can't find my other earring.

1149
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:55,310
This is Veda.

1150
01:26:58,490 --> 01:27:01,020
- I'm really sorry.
- Could you give us a minute?

1151
01:27:05,930 --> 01:27:07,370
Who's that?

1152
01:27:08,570 --> 01:27:10,370
That's Suzanne.

1153
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:18,410
She and I are gonna be married
this fall.

1154
01:27:19,580 --> 01:27:22,480
I was gonna bring her to class
next week.

1155
01:27:22,550 --> 01:27:25,180
I want her to hear your poem.

1156
01:27:27,060 --> 01:27:29,220
Please, honey.
I cared for him too.

1157
01:27:29,320 --> 01:27:31,260
- Please!
- Get away from me!

1158
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:36,430
Sweetheart, don't...

1159
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,930
<i>Why do you think people
want to get married?</i>

1160
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,490
<i>When you get old,
you just have to.</i>

1161
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:21,370
<i>Who's that with your dad?</i>

1162
01:28:22,180 --> 01:28:24,110
<i>That's my mother.</i>

1163
01:28:26,250 --> 01:28:28,770
<i>I'm gonna be an acrobat
when I grow up.</i>

1164
01:28:31,750 --> 01:28:34,450
<i>Would you think of me?</i>

1165
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:37,420
<i>If you don't get to marry
Mr. Bixler.</i>

1166
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:44,330
<i>Now we're blood brothers for life.</i>

1167
01:29:02,580 --> 01:29:05,380
- We haven't found her yet.
- She can't be alone in the dark!

1168
01:29:05,450 --> 01:29:08,510
- We'll keep looking.
- We've been looking since this morning.

1169
01:29:08,620 --> 01:29:10,060
Her teacher said...

1170
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:12,090
I know. You told us.

1171
01:29:18,670 --> 01:29:21,230
Are you okay?

1172
01:29:23,910 --> 01:29:27,710
I should have told Thomas J.
he was my best friend.

1173
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:30,710
I'm sure he knew.

1174
01:29:42,490 --> 01:29:45,150
I stole some money
from your cookie jar...

1175
01:29:45,260 --> 01:29:47,280
to pay for the writing class.

1176
01:29:51,270 --> 01:29:54,130
- It's okay.
- I'll pay you back.

1177
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:58,070
Besides, I don't think
I'll ever go to class again.

1178
01:29:59,870 --> 01:30:01,710
Tell you what.

1179
01:30:01,780 --> 01:30:06,240
You dedicate your first book to me.
I'll forget the whole thing.

1180
01:30:06,310 --> 01:30:08,370
I will. I promise.

1181
01:30:08,450 --> 01:30:10,380
Get into bed.

1182
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:33,400
'Night.

1183
01:30:52,390 --> 01:30:53,950
She's here.

1184
01:31:12,150 --> 01:31:15,170
- Did I kill my mother?
- What?

1185
01:31:18,790 --> 01:31:22,310
The bees killed Thomas J.,
and I killed my mother.

1186
01:31:32,570 --> 01:31:34,530
That wasn't your fault.

1187
01:31:36,300 --> 01:31:39,270
Things like that aren't anybody's fault.

1188
01:31:39,340 --> 01:31:41,270
It just happened.

1189
01:31:45,850 --> 01:31:47,780
I found this.

1190
01:31:53,150 --> 01:31:55,210
I forgot about that picture.

1191
01:31:55,320 --> 01:31:58,160
- Where'd you find it?
- In the garage.

1192
01:31:59,460 --> 01:32:03,060
That little Chevy
was your mother's favorite car.

1193
01:32:03,900 --> 01:32:05,700
What was my mama like?

1194
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:09,730
She was pretty.

1195
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:11,740
Kind.

1196
01:32:11,810 --> 01:32:13,740
She had your eyes.

1197
01:32:16,380 --> 01:32:18,310
Did she love to laugh.

1198
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:23,980
Sometimes when you laugh,
you sound just like her.

1199
01:32:24,050 --> 01:32:25,480
Really?

1200
01:32:27,590 --> 01:32:30,720
Know what she did when she found out
she was going to have you?

1201
01:32:32,660 --> 01:32:35,530
She came home
and painted this whole room pink.

1202
01:32:36,900 --> 01:32:39,200
She was so sure
she was going to have a little girl.

1203
01:32:39,270 --> 01:32:41,730
Do you miss her?

1204
01:32:44,910 --> 01:32:47,030
I did very much...

1205
01:32:47,110 --> 01:32:48,840
for a long time.

1206
01:32:50,240 --> 01:32:55,510
Even now, I get a little sad
when I think about a pretty flower...

1207
01:32:55,580 --> 01:32:58,180
or a beautiful sunset
she would have liked.

1208
01:32:58,250 --> 01:33:03,090
I think every time I see a climbing
tree, I'll think of Thomas J.

1209
01:33:04,060 --> 01:33:05,720
That's good.

1210
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:07,990
Memories are good, sweetheart.

1211
01:33:09,830 --> 01:33:12,770
I'm sorry.

1212
01:33:13,730 --> 01:33:17,190
I was trying to keep it from you.

1213
01:33:20,110 --> 01:33:22,040
I just couldn't.

1214
01:33:25,810 --> 01:33:28,710
You're a good girl.
I want you to be happy.

1215
01:33:29,780 --> 01:33:32,310
Don't be an old grump like me.

1216
01:33:39,790 --> 01:33:41,730
See you in the morning.

1217
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:46,630
Daddy.

1218
01:33:48,100 --> 01:33:50,040
It's not so bad to be like you.

1219
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:18,800
How are you doing?

1220
01:34:21,500 --> 01:34:23,990
Some days I think I'll be okay...

1221
01:34:24,070 --> 01:34:26,340
Others...

1222
01:34:26,410 --> 01:34:30,040
I have to force myself
even to get out of bed.

1223
01:34:30,110 --> 01:34:34,310
I know it's crazy, but sometimes I think
he's just away at camp.

1224
01:34:35,780 --> 01:34:37,720
How's Veda?

1225
01:34:37,790 --> 01:34:39,480
She's doing much better.

1226
01:34:39,550 --> 01:34:41,520
She's just inside.

1227
01:34:53,570 --> 01:34:56,230
I've been wanting to see you.

1228
01:34:59,740 --> 01:35:01,940
Thomas J. had this on him.

1229
01:35:03,180 --> 01:35:05,170
I thought you might like to have it.

1230
01:35:16,860 --> 01:35:19,120
You were such a good friend to him.

1231
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:22,350
I hope you'll still come by
and visit me.

1232
01:35:22,460 --> 01:35:25,830
I will.
I promise.

1233
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:38,440
Thomas J. will be all right.

1234
01:35:38,510 --> 01:35:40,880
My mother will take care of him.

1235
01:35:44,120 --> 01:35:46,050
Thank you.

1236
01:35:55,030 --> 01:35:58,430
"Encased in talent,
like a uniform...

1237
01:35:58,470 --> 01:36:01,090
the rank of every poet
is well known.

1238
01:36:02,670 --> 01:36:06,700
They can amaze us
like a thunderstorm...

1239
01:36:06,770 --> 01:36:10,210
or die so young...

1240
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:12,540
or live for years alone."

1241
01:36:15,880 --> 01:36:18,720
My advice to you on our last class:

1242
01:36:20,820 --> 01:36:23,420
Be a thunderstorm.

1243
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:26,390
What exactly do you mean by that?

1244
01:36:28,930 --> 01:36:32,630
I mean, be dangerous...

1245
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:36,270
and unpredictable.

1246
01:36:37,340 --> 01:36:40,070
And make a lot of noise.

1247
01:36:49,480 --> 01:36:53,610
We missed you, man!
Give me a hug.

1248
01:36:56,790 --> 01:36:59,350
I was hoping you'd stop by today.

1249
01:37:04,130 --> 01:37:06,000
Can't stay.

1250
01:37:06,070 --> 01:37:08,000
I just came to read my poem.

1251
01:37:08,070 --> 01:37:10,000
We'd love to hear it.

1252
01:37:16,780 --> 01:37:19,770
"Weeping willow with your tears
running down...

1253
01:37:19,850 --> 01:37:22,780
why do you always weep and frown?

1254
01:37:22,850 --> 01:37:25,820
Is it because he left you one day?

1255
01:37:25,890 --> 01:37:28,620
Is it because he could not stay?

1256
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:32,190
On your branches he would swing.

1257
01:37:32,260 --> 01:37:35,920
Do you long for the happiness
that day would bring?

1258
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,190
He found shelter in your shade.

1259
01:37:39,330 --> 01:37:42,060
You thought his laughter
would never fade.

1260
01:37:43,140 --> 01:37:46,300
Weeping willow, stop your tears.

1261
01:37:46,370 --> 01:37:49,000
There is something to calm your fears.

1262
01:37:50,210 --> 01:37:54,310
You think death has ripped you
forever apart.

1263
01:37:54,380 --> 01:37:57,280
But I know he'll always
be in your heart."

<i>I finally swallowed that chicken bone.</i>

1266

just renominated Mr. Nixon.</i>

1268
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:24,050
Best watched using Open Subtitles MKV Player

1269
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,480
我一出生就患黄疸病

1270
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,390
有一次坐在车站的马桶上厕所
从此就得了痔疮

1271
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,860
一块鸡骨头
已经卡在我喉咙里三年了

1272
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,020
我肯定爸爸知道
我最近的烦恼痛苦时会崩溃的

1273
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,590
爸爸，我并不想使你伤心……

1274
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:14,730
但我左边胸部
发育得比右边的快很多

1275
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,100
这只可能意味着一件事：癌症

1276
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,470
我快要死了

1277
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:25,180
亲爱的，帮我到冰箱拿点蛋黄酱

1278
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,730
哪几个人要进来？举高你的手

1279
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,730
你要不要进去？汤姆斯

1280
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,170
-我不进去了    -我就知道他不敢

1281
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,900
我要回家了

1282
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,730
他要回去跟洋娃娃玩

1283
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,600
不准欺负他

1284
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,870
来吧，跟我进来

1285
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,780
你们还没有付钱

1286
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:07,250
我们怎么知道你是不是
能让我们看到一个真的？

1287
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,880
你可真幼稚

1288
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,660
好吧，拿着

1289
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,400
跟着我，千万别发出声响

1290
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,270
准备好了吗？

1291
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:41,890
你们确定有足够胆量吗？
还是想退缩了？

1292
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,360
我不是胆小鬼

1293
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:46,290
向前靠

1294
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,030
是空的

1295
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,560
-你是个骗子   -我想要回我的钱

1296
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:59,270
-我很害怕这个   -害怕什么？

1297
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,500
有时候他们被送来时……

1298
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,170
并不是完全死了的

1299
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,340
就好像人们
把鸡的脖子割了下来……

1300
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,380
但它们的身体还会四处走

1301
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:09,510
你满口大话！

1302
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,580
我打赌她正在房子的某个地方徘徊

1303
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,690
她就在摇摇椅那儿坐着

1304
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,910
嗨，奶奶

1305
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,690
薇达，把我的香烟拿下来好吗？

1306
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,670
呆会见

1307
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:08,440
知道吗？他是我木匠工艺班的
老师   -你学过木匠工艺？

1308
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:12,240
我做过铁路的枕木

1309
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,880
-那种横放在铁路基上
以固定铁轨的梁吗？  -是的

1310
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,850
放到凳子上

1311
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:26,220
我玩垄断游戏
（一种棋盘游戏）赢了 汤姆斯

1312
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,390
铁架上要放6根横木

1313
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,900
我现在还保留着一些

1314
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,130
-阿瑟！   -薇达！

1315
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,900
-我玩垄断游戏赢了汤姆斯
-祝贺你

1316
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:40,500
一旦你把酒店建在木板道
或停车场上，你就输定了

1317
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:44,070
-我喜欢把铁路买下来
-我们正在工作呢

1318
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,620
库鲁拉偷走了所有的小狗

1319
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,130
她会捉弄它们

1320
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,720
递套管给我

1321
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,460
他正在街上散步

1322
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,400
唱着“多-拉
嘀嘀-嘀嘀 当-嘀嘀-嘟”

1323
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,440
弹着他的手指，慢吞吞地走--

1324
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,480
-薇达！   -爸爸？

1325
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:19,180
我正在为我的中学老师
涂防腐剂，别在这里唱歌

1326
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,120
好，阿瑟，把他往我这边推过来一点

1327
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,390
替他准备个C-501尺寸的……

1328
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:34,120
青铜不锈钢质地的
“永恒的旅行”型号

1329
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,930
他看起来会像个严肃的战士

1330
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,460
请问哈利・桑特夫斯先生在吗？

1331
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:13,970
是的，请进来吧

1332
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,850
那么，您最近是否很不幸地……

1333
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,180
痛失了某位亲朋好友？

1334
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,390
我可以见你父亲一会吗？

1335
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:41,030
爸爸！有人找你！

1336
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,730
他正在楼下为莱顿先生服务

1337
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,070
前列腺癌。只要得了这种病
你就注定没救了

1338
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,610
我可以怎样帮助您？

1339
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,080
我是雪莉・德沃都

1340
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:03,850
我们曾经就化妆师这份工作谈过

1341
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,410
-是的   -我希望你们仍然想聘人

1342
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,180
我想是的

1343
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,650
我有专业美容化妆师的执照

1344
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:15,750
曾经在迪诺・拉菲尔沙龙工作2年

1345
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:18,390
顾客们都很喜欢我

1346
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,160
我性格和蔼温顺
总能使顾客平静安逸

1347
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,260
这些人已非常平静安逸

1348
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,140
我们不是美容院，而是殡仪馆

1349
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,120
-死人？   -是的

1350
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,950
死翘翘了？

1351
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,880
逝世了

1352
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,750
广告里只写了“招聘化妆师”

1353
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,790
抱歉，失陪一下

1354
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,790
请便

1355
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,130
你好，乔治

1356
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,790
把1258号棺材上的
磨光金属把手去掉

1357
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,600
-那是你的旅游车吗？   -是的

1358
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,230
真酷！

1359
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:02,140
你好

1360
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,240
她很害羞

1361
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,470
请放置在陈列室

1362
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,480
爸爸，为什么这棺材那么小？

1363
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,250
棺材有各种的型号，就跟鞋子一样

1364
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:21,630
-那是给小孩子的吗？   -当然不是

1365
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,530
那是给什么人的？

1366
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,930
矮人。非常矮的人

1367
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,700
抱歉，工作的事情如何？

1368
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,330
什么？

1369
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,270
我需要这份工作

1370
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,670
你仍然愿意做吗？即使……

1371
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,180
当然。完全没问题

1372
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,110
我过去的顾客……

1373
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,120
最终会死去……

1374
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,180
而你的客户过去都是活人

1375
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,350
他们之间存在着共同点

1376
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,520
你的工作包括替顾客整理
头发和化装，以及接听电话

1377
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:56,330
-成交，桑特夫斯先生
-你可以立即开始了

1378
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,330
叫我哈利吧

1379
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,130
请问你经常如此着装……

1380
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,260
工作吗？

1381
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:07,210
别误会，你的衣服很好看

1382
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,610
-但是
-我会好好照顾这些顾客的

1383
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,380
他们死了，应该得到我们的尊重

1384
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,680
他们留下的只有外表了

1385
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,330
看着，我不用脚踩

1386
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,500
哇，就像埃维尔・克尼维尔
（美国特技演员）一样酷

1387
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:50,780
你们到我的车库来干什么？

1388
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:53,290
别再到这里来！

1389
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:24,820
你好，薇达。
今天又有哪里不舒服吗？

1390
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,850
我病得很严重

1391
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,360
坐一下，我通知医生

1392
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,630
薇达来了，她说自己病了

1393
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,290
她看起来没事

1394
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,040
医生在等你了

1395
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,070
进去吧

1396
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:53,380
怎么样？我可以接受任何事实的

1397
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,140
你非常健康

1398
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:58,050
不可能。我有标准的病症

1399
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,180
他们把莱顿先生送去你们那了？

1400
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,490
-是的   -你不可以再这样做了

1401
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:07,090
你的身体一点问题也没有

1402
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,700
我会去看另一位医生

1403
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,780
医生说你有什么问题？

1404
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:28,650
所有的医生都是笨蛋

1405
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,050
等等我！

1406
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,730
-看！   -看什么？

1407
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,270
那是比斯勒先生。 去跟他聊天吧

1408
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,770
我不想跟老师聊天

1409
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:59,570
桑特夫斯小姐和汤姆斯博士

1410
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:01,580
-你们的暑假过得怎样？   -还不错

1411
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:05,310
米勒斯老师，我完成了
所有的暑假阅读作业

1412
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:08,650
真的？已经读完了？暑假才刚开始呢

1413
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,990
是的。现在我正在读
“战争与和平”以娱乐

1414
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,580
怪不得你拿了作文奖

1415
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:16,830
-你呢？汤姆斯   -我还没开始阅读

1416
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,200
帮助他一下，薇达

1417
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,030
你为什么油刷这间房子？

1418
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:25,060
我刚买了它，现在正在搞装修

1419
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:27,570
对单身汉来说这房子太大了

1420
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,100
你绝不可以这样说

1421
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:34,150
我可能会养一只猫

1422
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:39,180
你现在正在放假，
怎能支撑这笔费用？

1423
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,380
我将去教创造性写作班

1424
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,550
-我在工作
-进写作班要交多少钱？

1425
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:48,260
-35美元   -你要怎样工作？

1426
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:51,730
每星期教授两个小时关于诗的知识

1427
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,770
这是个调查吗？薇达

1428
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,700
不

1429
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,500
我想我要回家看完“战争与和平”了

1430
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:02,170
现在是暑假，你们是孩子。玩耍去吧

1431
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,650
想去格雷的果园摘桃子吃吗？

1432
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,520
不，我要回家了

1433
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,420
为什么？还没到晚饭时间

1434
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:18,980
你像一只狗，回家只为了吃饭

1435
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,620
别在消防栓旁小便！

1436
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,240
比尔

1437
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:48,310
我将永远如此爱你

1438
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:51,950
我从你身上看到爱情

1439
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:55,330
五月的眼睛

1440
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:59,420
噢，但我是否能看到

1441
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,900
我的婚礼

1442
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:07,100
格温打电话来，
发生了一起严重的交通意外

1443
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:08,640
他们明天会送两个过来

1444
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:11,140
我弄好莱顿先生的头发了

1445
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:12,940
他看起来--

1446
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:15,710
-薇达怎么了？   -她在演戏

1447
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,650
起来吃你的花椰菜

1448
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:21,820
我想我得了前列腺癌

1449
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:23,620
像场“天灾人祸”？

1450
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,320
有多少幸存者？

1451
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:29,730
（我有旋律，我有音乐）

1452
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,830
（我有亲爱的恋人）

1453
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,200
（我有雏菊）

1454
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,240
（在那绿色的牧场上）

1455
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:41,240
（我的卧室里有一个人）

1456
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:44,680
（那是我亲爱的恋人）

1457
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,510
-谁赢了？   -我

1458
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,130
看！薇达和她的小男朋友

1459
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,160
他不是我的男朋友

1460
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:03,560
我打赌薇达会亲他的嘴唇

1461
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:08,070
-你以为我会亲那难看的物体？
-没错，她不会

1462
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,630
我们走吧

1463
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,760
朱迪的爸爸有个小电影院

1464
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,840
我们可以免费看所有喜欢看的电影

1465
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,710
-以后你也去看吧   -别邀请她

1466
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:20,180
她会带她的男朋友去的

1467
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,440
薇达和汤姆斯

1468
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,250
坐在一棵树上

1469
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,190
亲--吻

1470
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:32,120
相爱，结婚

1471
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:37,130
然后有了 小汤姆斯坐在婴儿车里

1472
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,460
你们……

1473
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:40,360
别在意她们说的话

1474
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,240
我没有不开心，
我绝不跟她们一起玩

1475
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:48,070
我只跟能彼此促进智力的人交往

1476
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,280
要一块巧克力吗？

1477
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,580
-我对这个过敏   -对巧克力？

1478
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:02,210
-他对所有东西都过敏
-包括巧克力？

1479
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:04,850
所有东西

1480
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,860
你戴的戒指真漂亮

1481
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:10,420
是个情绪戒指

1482
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,300
-能够显示出主人的情绪
-根本无效

1483
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:15,360
-他总是黑色的
-只有跟你在一起时才是

1484
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,530
你使我心情不佳

1485
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,610
或者黑色代表快乐

1486
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:21,970
我不认为如此

1487
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,440
雪莉，我怎样才能拿到35美元？

1488
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:27,540
她疯了
她想在暑假里到学校去学习

1489
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,140
不是真正的课程，只是参加写作班

1490
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,150
我想成为一个作家

1491
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,620
她着迷那个老师

1492
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,950
闭上你的大嘴巴！

1493
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:39,490
我想你会成为一个好作家的

1494
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,530
你问过你父亲了吗？

1495
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,120
他不会给我的

1496
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,220
你怎么知道？

1497
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,790
问他

1498
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:51,270
伊迪斯，克朗凯特（美国著名
新闻主播）在哪个频道？

1499
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:53,530
第二频道，阿奇

1500
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,610
我们总不看那频道，因为你说……

1501
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:58,440
沃尔特・克朗凯特是个共产主义者

1502
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,790
我从没那样说过，伊迪斯

1503
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,760
而且他并不完全是共产主义者

1504
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,820
怎么了？什么也看不到

1505
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,830
爸爸，我来帮你

1506
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,060
爸爸，可以给35美元我吗？

1507
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,930
对一个小女孩来说，这是一大笔钱

1508
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,660
是学费

1509
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:25,570
暑假写作班

1510
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,230
还有苏打水吗？

1511
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,740
雪莉觉得我会成为一个成功的作家

1512
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,340
上个月你想学小提琴

1513
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:39,720
接着想成为口技大师

1514
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,220
爸爸？

1515
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:43,520
我喜欢这家伙

1516
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:47,060
-爸爸   -什么事？

1517
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:49,060
我要的钱？

1518
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,030
或者下个月吧

1519
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,870
他忘了我曾经想成为魔术师

1520
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:00,170
我擅长把自己变消失

1521
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:06,810
想玩吗？

1522
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,010
不，我要到公墓去

1523
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,520
抬高你的头

1524
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,950
别看着球，看我这来

1525
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,720
看到 了吗？你总是看着球

1526
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,930
明白了吗？抬高你的头

1527
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,660
拍下手

1528
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,960
开门！开门！

1529
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,580
开门！快点开门！

1530
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,850
快点开门！

1531
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:30,730
他正在街上散步

1532
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,730
唱着-“多-拉
嘀嘀-嘀嘀  当-嘀嘀-嘟”

1533
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,460
弹着他的手指，慢吞吞地走着

1534
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,540
发生了什么事？

1535
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:44,600
我的球，我的球掉了

1536
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:47,150
起来吧

1537
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,880
打扰一下，哈利

1538
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,820
你过来看下伯特夫人的妆好吗？

1539
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,970
我不是给了她的照片你吗？

1540
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,040
你不满意？

1541
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,880
这位是伯特牧师的妻子

1542
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:24,750
你把她弄得像个廉价妓女

1543
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,910
我觉得她看起来很漂亮

1544
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:28,550
她的嘴唇很薄

1545
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:32,180
我为她勾出唇线，看起来会更性感

1546
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:36,130
而且眼睛也画了眼影

1547
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,460
至于头发--1972年的
今天没有人会梳这种发型 了

1548
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,870
她梳这种发型

1549
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,900
相片是1个月前在教堂照的

1550
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:46,960
我想摈弃那种
一贯的女教师的形象模式

1551
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,480
那不是什么模式

1552
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,840
她是个老教师

1553
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:53,680
重新化过

1554
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,690
我想知道……

1555
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,730
薇达是不是有什么问题？

1556
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,230
什么意思？

1557
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,700
-那天晚上
-噢，那件事。她喜欢演戏

1558
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,430
我不赞同

1559
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,770
我想她对死亡感到很困扰

1560
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:19,070
她在一家殡仪馆长大，
她对此有所了解

1561
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:20,570
我真的觉得--

1562
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,130
她是个开心的11岁女孩

1563
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,710
听着……

1564
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:28,810
我不需要你来建议我
怎样照顾女儿，明白吗？

1565
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:35,290
昨天的昨天，不是昨天

1566
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,090
24个劫匪来敲我家的门

1567
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,460
当我开门让他们进来的时候

1568
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:43,620
他们如此对我说

1569
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,830
小馅饼，小馅饼，转过身

1570
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,960
是雪莉！

1571
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,170
我们可以看一下你的旅游车吗？

1572
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,680
当然，我会为你做第一流的导游

1573
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,020
这实在太酷了

1574
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:12,920
你真的可以在这里吃饭和睡觉吗？

1575
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,760
我把你们载到利物浦去

1576
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,700
big ringo fun

1577
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,300
-你想喝点苏打水吗？   -我要

1578
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,030
-汤姆斯呢？   -好的，谢谢

1579
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:32,070
你在读什么书？

1580
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:38,680
你不应该看这本书的，
还未适合你读呢

1581
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:41,020
你把这些书都读完了吗？

1582
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:42,520
书里都写了些什么？

1583
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:46,320
几乎都是浪漫的爱情故事

1584
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,390
无聊

1585
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:52,190
读起来很有意思

1586
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,760
来，干杯

1587
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,200
你结婚了吗？

1588
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:02,470
不，我离婚了

1589
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,910
爸爸说离婚不是件好事

1590
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,040
确实。但有时候人们发觉……

1591
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,050
他们再也无法跟彼此生活在一起

1592
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,740
the MERYER'S 离婚了

1593
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,180
我可以吃块曲奇饼干吗？

1594
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:19,050
饼干在哪里？

1595
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:23,650
我想你发现我的秘密了

1596
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,670
你存钱干什么呢？

1597
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:28,900
没什么特别原因

1598
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:30,700
只是存着备用

1599
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:35,540
我要回家吃午饭了

1600
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:36,940
谢谢你的招待，雪莉

1601
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:39,910
再见

1602
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,950
那么

1603
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:46,080
-我们也回去吧
-我可以用下你的洗手间吗？

1604
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:47,780
-当然可以   -你不用等我的

1605
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,790
爸爸很不喜欢别人迟到

1606
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:05,970
不存偏见

1607
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:08,600
敢爱敢恨的人

1608
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:12,370
是真正的伟人

1609
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:17,040
这是公元600年
一位中国哲学家的名言

1610
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,920
为什么我在创造性
写作的课堂上给你们讲呢？

1611
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,960
因为……

1612
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:28,090
你本身的看法会影响
你对现实作正确的评价

1613
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:32,390
也就是说
我希望你们以坦诚的态度

1614
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:35,730
听其他同学读他们的作品

1615
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:39,760
那么，谁想拔头筹？

1616
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:41,310
我来读一首

1617
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:49,610
我唱一首歌给你听

1618
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,210
我画幅画给你看

1619
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:54,780
我折一朵玫瑰给你闻

1620
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,620
我种植一棵小草给你触摸

1621
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:59,790
但你没有听我的歌

1622
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:02,630
你没有看我的画

1623
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,860
你没有闻我的玫瑰，
也没有触摸我的小草

1624
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:09,100
或者她离开了？

1625
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:11,040
那样并不能显示你的幽默感，女士

1626
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,940
他的诗轻浮夸张

1627
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,980
晦涩生疏的词汇令我们一头雾水

1628
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,440
我听到了意见

1629
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:20,610
大家别忘了要用
宽大的胸怀接纳别人的观点

1630
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:25,050
我能为你做什么吗？

1631
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,950
我交了学费

1632
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,150
报读这个课程？

1633
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:32,660
我想成为一个作家

1634
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:39,020
但是，薇达
这是为成年人设的写作班

1635
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:43,700
我觉得很好，她想当作家

1636
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,500
加油，小妹妹

1637
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,570
你确定你想加入？

1638
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,940
欢迎

1639
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,640
找个位置坐下来

1640
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,660
谁想成为下一个？

1641
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:07,190
前几天男朋友给了我灵感……

1642
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,200
我写下了一些句子

1643
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,860
读给大家听吧，郎达

1644
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,640
他覆盖在我身上……

1645
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:21,400
像一张冷夜里的毛毯

1646
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:26,040
当我看进他的眼里，我知道--

1647
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:29,780
我应伸手去触摸，去感觉

1648
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:32,320
我知道他是真实的

1649
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:36,250
我们的肉体互相契合

1650
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,520
我完全

1651
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,000
无法抗拒

1652
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:47,520
醒来时与他融为一体

1653
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:02,410
我也写了一首诗

1654
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,750
请读

1655
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:08,720
“冰淇淋颂”薇达・桑特夫斯

1656
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:12,020
我很喜欢冰淇淋
天气热的时候尝起来很美味

1657
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:15,390
甜筒和盒装都令我羡慕至极

1658
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:20,060
还有香草，巧克力或脆皮

1659
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:22,230
我写的就这么多

1660
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,170
我听明白了

1661
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:27,640
“肉体”或者“脆皮”

1662
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:29,870
都是是关于“需要”

1663
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,410
意境很美，也押韵

1664
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,080
写得不错，但……

1665
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:41,180
没有抒发出真正的感想

1666
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:44,280
我想你们告诉我你对世界的看法

1667
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:47,420
你的恐惧，你的需要

1668
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,930
你心底的秘密

1669
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,520
我的恐惧和秘密

1670
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,430
我害怕妈妈是因为我而死的

1671
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:31,040
我无法生存

1672
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:34,160
如果哈利不爱我

1673
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,240
打扰了，哈利

1674
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:41,250
花已经送来了，追悼室也布置好了

1675
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,370
谢谢你

1676
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:45,010
非常抱歉那天……

1677
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:47,020
谈薇达的事时

1678
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:48,180
我的言辞激动无礼

1679
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:51,850
我不应该对别人的事多加意见的

1680
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,860
我只是很喜欢薇达，想关心她

1681
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:57,760
我妻子死后，奶奶住进这里……

1682
00:28:57,830 --> 00:29:00,770
帮我照顾薇达

1683
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,600
她们很亲密

1684
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:06,300
但最近，奶奶越来越糊涂……

1685
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:08,530
薇达有点接受不了

1686
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,650
我相信她会振作起来的

1687
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:15,350
我想她一定会的

1688
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:20,220
今天一直没有鱼上钩

1689
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:22,050
或者它们吃了很多早餐

1690
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,560
我长大了要当杂技演员

1691
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:28,990
厉害，我也可以做。
你的鱼竿有动静了

1692
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:33,360
快点！

1693
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,960
我在努力

1694
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,940
拉线

1695
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,120
今天很愉快，放了它

1696
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:52,240
我不喜欢接触鱼

1697
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,150
我会把鱼钩拿出来

1698
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,780
你会弄伤它的

1699
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:07,160
该死的鱼钩！我流血了。它走了吗？

1700
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:08,900
我去看一下

1701
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:13,800
它游走了。我们回去吧

1702
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:15,900
我们可以成为结拜兄弟

1703
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:17,710
我不想

1704
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,710
你可以把手臂上的伤疤挖开

1705
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,340
是蚊子咬的

1706
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,210
会流血的

1707
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,620
如果我这样做，是不是就可以走了？

1708
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:33,160
把他们混合在一起

1709
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,960
我们滴血为盟，是一辈子的兄弟了

1710
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:58,740
你好，有事吗？

1711
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:01,080
没什么

1712
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,180
只是想看下你在做什么

1713
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,990
我在为一份葬礼讣告准备定稿

1714
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,490
我们在报纸上公布逝世者的死讯

1715
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,550
这是为顾客提供的一项服务

1716
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:13,400
这样

1717
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:17,760
贝德・洛伦佐

1718
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:20,070
死于1972年6月22日

1719
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:23,340
是尼科尔深爱的丈夫

1720
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:27,640
法布里希欧和海蒂尊敬的父亲

1721
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:31,910
放下你的鲜花，取而代之
请捐助其名下的慈善基金会

1722
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,450
我写的

1723
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,460
真的？

1724
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,420
写得很好

1725
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:39,960
我喜欢这个词“取而代之”

1726
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:43,590
我觉得比用“代替”好
这样更带文学性

1727
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:46,290
“代替”-“取而代之”

1728
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:47,530
毫无疑问

1729
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,540
我只是班门弄斧而已

1730
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:53,530
你必须学下怎样接受赞扬

1731
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,870
“电影”

1732
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:59,900
“爱情故事”正提供免下车观看

1733
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:02,450
很感人的电影，你看过吗？

1734
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:05,590
我很多年没有看电影了

1735
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:07,590
我很喜欢看电影

1736
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,950
尤其是免下车电影院

1737
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:13,080
没有什么比
在车上看电影更浪漫的了

1738
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,730
我不打扰你工作了

1739
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,230
我喜欢玩宾果游戏
（一种美式赌博游戏）

1740
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:32,010
如果你想去玩，欢迎明天晚上过来

1741
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:53,320
-你要外出吗？   -不

1742
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:57,340
-那为什么擦唇膏？
女孩子总想以最美的一面示人

1743
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,370
我觉得擦唇膏看起来不自然

1744
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:01,800
没有人的嘴唇是那种颜色的

1745
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:03,340
你有试过擦唇膏吗？

1746
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:04,470
没有

1747
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,640
到这来，坐下

1748
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,120
像这样把嘴巴张开

1749
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,920
小一点

1750
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:26,590
好了

1751
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,890
现在我们抿一下

1752
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:38,540
看一下

1753
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:40,340
你擦唇膏很好看

1754
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,350
你觉得我漂亮吗？

1755
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:46,750
是的，我觉得你很漂亮

1756
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:49,020
你有一双又大又美……

1757
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:51,350
闪闪发光的眼睛

1758
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:53,520
可爱的小鼻子

1759
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:55,260
和迷人的嘴巴

1760
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:59,130
学校里的男孩子觉得我不漂亮

1761
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,690
他们以后会发觉的

1762
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:02,930
闭上你的眼睛

1763
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,510
我要带出它们的最大魅力

1764
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:10,780
眼部化妆的第一法则是……

1765
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:14,180
蓝色的眼影永远也不会嫌多

1766
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:16,810
你喜欢替人们化妆吗？

1767
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:20,590
我曾经想到好莱坞去……

1768
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:23,850
帮电影明星们化装，但是……

1769
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,260
我现在还没能到那里去

1770
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:33,390
行了，睁开你的眼睛

1771
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:42,270
毫无疑问我会延迟我的好莱坞梦想

1772
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,650
-你的嘴唇流血了？   -没有

1773
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,720
你的眼睛怎么 了？

1774
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:01,920
一个女孩擦多少眼影也不会嫌多

1775
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,720
你的 自行车呢？

1776
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,790
在车房里

1777
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,700
跟我来

1778
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:14,570
只是个车房而已，过来吧

1779
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,070
我有一边的彩带不见了

1780
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:21,140
可能掉在地上了

1781
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,480
看下这个

1782
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,320
那是奶奶的

1783
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,980
是颅相学模型

1784
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,320
是用来研究你头上的机理……

1785
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:34,360
分析你是否有好的人格

1786
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:37,630
-我来研究下你的头部   -不要

1787
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,720
别这样，很有趣的

1788
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:51,280
-真奇怪   -什么？

1789
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:53,280
你没有人格

1790
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:56,010
-哪里有写这个？   -我瞎掰的

1791
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:00,880
那是你爸爸吗？

1792
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,820
跟你爸爸一起的是谁？

1793
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,870
是我妈妈

1794
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:15,600
-你记得她吗？   -不记得

1795
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:17,930
奶奶说她去了天堂

1796
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,030
你觉得那里是什么样子的？

1797
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,940
-哪里？   -天堂

1798
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:27,880
我想每个
在天堂里的人都有一匹白马

1799
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:31,850
他们每天只是骑马和吃蜜饯

1800
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,790
人们彼此非常友好相爱

1801
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:39,030
运动时，不会分组……

1802
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:41,060
所以没有人会输

1803
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:43,820
但如果你害怕骑马呢？

1804
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:48,330
那也没关系。它们不是一般的马

1805
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,840
它们长着翅膀

1806
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:53,960
就算你摔下来也没什么大不了 的

1807
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:56,670
你只会倒在云朵上面

1808
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:59,040
听起来很不错

1809
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:01,380
走吧，我们去找彩带

1810
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:21,260
发生什么事了？

1811
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,630
没什么

1812
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,170
我在穿衣服

1813
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:25,700
你在穿衣服

1814
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:31,040
你知不知道对你哥哥

1815
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,840
撒谎是不好的？

1816
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:36,410
-小心我的头发！还有衬衣！
-快坦白！

1817
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,350
好吧！

1818
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:41,510
我要跟雪莉出去

1819
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:44,150
非常好

1820
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:49,020
-我很紧张   -为什么？

1821
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,620
我对上一次约会
已经是20年前的事了

1822
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,030
确实是

1823
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,060
坐下来

1824
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:00,730
让我给你解释一下今天的女人

1825
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,810
自从你上一次约会后，
世界发生了大变化

1826
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:05,470
性别革命

1827
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:09,280
在那之前，你必须为女人开车门……

1828
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:11,870
为她拉凳子，付钱

1829
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:13,420
就这么多

1830
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:16,510
你知道缺了什么吗？胸罩

1831
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,290
-噢，别开玩笑   -我是认真的

1832
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,290
相信我，哈利

1833
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,690
妇女解放的关键就在此

1834
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:27,200
你要像对待男人一样待这些女人

1835
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:28,890
你确定？

1836
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:31,960
你不是告诉薇达
说我是个玩女人专家吗？

1837
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:33,840
我就要迟到了

1838
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,610
-雪莉随时可能到达   -她来载你？

1839
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,480
你做的很正确

1840
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:44,310
她只是开车过来，
然后我们坐我的车去

1841
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:47,250
我看起来如何？

1842
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,590
像个真正的桑特夫斯先生

1843
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,180
去获取她的芳心吧

1844
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,290
晚上好

1845
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:02,830
你为什么穿得
这么好去玩宾果游戏？

1846
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,500
我想穿得整齐点

1847
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,370
你之前从来不在乎的

1848
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,410
我和雪莉一起去

1849
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,540
-为什么？   -她喜欢玩宾果

1850
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,140
我可以去吗？

1851
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:17,010
不，你最好留在这里陪奶奶

1852
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:02,260
我必须承认，我会尽量……

1853
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:06,270
阻止这些受酬金驱使的人到这里来

1854
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:08,490
我已经对此有点厌倦了

1855
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:12,900
我们开始得不错，
我会继续按这样子走下去

1856
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:15,570
你从来不回答我的问题

1857
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:26,610
-你在哪？   -这里

1858
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:29,880
-别这样子   -对不起

1859
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,290
你想做什么？

1860
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:35,120
如果我妈妈发现
我走出来，她会打我的

1861
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,430
我们去教堂吧，他们在玩宾果游戏

1862
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,430
我跟你说过了，我会惹麻烦上身的

1863
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:42,260
-懦夫   -我不是

1864
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:45,670
-坏蛋   -才不是呢

1865
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:48,970
N-38

1866
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,570
“N”字母那行

1867
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,340
别笑。玩宾果有一套规则的

1868
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:56,080
例如，在特定的晚上，
所有人都可能会赢

1869
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:57,480
我总是选择基数

1870
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:59,520
选宾果卡片时……

1871
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:03,820
我运用概率规则，
避免号码的重复出现

1872
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:05,480
这样就可以玩得更久

1873
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,430
会更容易赢吗？

1874
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:12,260
不，只是可以玩得更久

1875
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:15,670
I-17。“I”字母行，1-7

1876
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:17,730
你好，卡尔，弗恩

1877
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:21,130
他们不会让我们进去的，
我们只是孩子

1878
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,870
我们不是来赌博，只是来看一下

1879
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:26,740
看宾果？我甚至讨厌这游戏

1880
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:28,280
蹲下来

1881
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:32,820
N-42

1882
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:35,350
“N”字母行，4-2

1883
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:37,050
太棒了！

1884
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,720
是你爸爸和雪莉！

1885
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:41,060
我不想让他们见到我

1886
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:43,690
3-7

1887
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:51,800
B-4。“B”字母行，4

1888
00:41:55,480 --> 00:42:00,440
O-69。“O”字母行，6-9

1889
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:03,480
-我有种不好的感觉   -什么感觉？

1890
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:08,680
不久我将要替这些人其中一些化妆

1891
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,690
为什么你觉得这些位置会变空？

1892
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:14,930
B-6

1893
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,020
“B”字母行，6

1894
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,220
-我们可以走了吗？   -安静！

1895
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:22,740
天黑以后父母不允许我外出的

1896
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,930
我运气很差

1897
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,870
不仅是靠运气

1898
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,430
取决于号码……

1899
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:34,610
一个只有10张卡的人
可以赢一个有100张卡的

1900
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,510
跟人一样

1901
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:40,050
什么意思？

1902
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,920
你可以在一间有100人的房子里……

1903
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:45,690
每一个都跟你不相称

1904
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,390
或者只是跟一个人住在一间房子里

1905
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:51,760
而他就是你想要的那个

1906
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:01,770
宾果！

1907
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:07,510
我们有胜利者了，
请举高你的手好吗？

1908
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:10,710
声音是从外面传进来的

1909
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:13,150
外面的人怎么可能会赢？

1910
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:15,950
外面的人并没有赢

1911
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:19,790
她只是叫了一声“宾果”
你这个笨蛋！

1912
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:22,760
-你叫谁笨蛋？   -阻止他们

1913
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:27,730
如果你不是200岁
我会一脚踢你的屁股上去！

1914
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,290
朋友们！

1915
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:31,460
-只是个游戏！   -我们可以走

1916
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:36,800
只是一些卡片
廉价的奖品。钟，玻璃器具而已

1917
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,820
今晚过得很愉快

1918
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:31,060
我很多年没有跟人一起去玩宾果了

1919
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:38,630
想进来坐一下吗？只是一会儿？

1920
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:55,520
家，温暖的家

1921
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:57,220
很舒适

1922
00:44:57,290 --> 00:44:59,260
我自己布置的

1923
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:03,260
我读了一篇文章，是关于
如何最大程度地利用空间

1924
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:06,460
确实看起来宽敞多了

1925
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,860
你可以看下洗手间
如果你有兴趣的话

1926
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,960
人们总是对
旅游车上的洗手间感到好奇

1927
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:13,800
譬如你怎样冲洗

1928
00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:30,480
你是否讨厌我？

1929
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:33,320
不。为什么这么问？

1930
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:37,930
不知道，你有点冷酷

1931
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,690
不替你开车门--

1932
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:44,200
那是菲尔的建议

1933
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:47,500
我落后了，我很多年没约会了

1934
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:49,580
自从我妻子死后

1935
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,080
她发生了什么事？

1936
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:57,910
分娩并发症

1937
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:01,480
生下薇达两天后她就死了

1938
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,160
她见过薇达吗？

1939
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:10,520
我把婴儿抱进房间……

1940
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,900
几次

1941
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:15,490
她睁开眼睛

1942
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,860
我想她见过薇达

1943
00:46:21,370 --> 00:46:23,310
她……

1944
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:27,710
我破坏了这个约会吗？

1945
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,570
和我跳舞吧？

1946
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:34,090
在这里？

1947
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:38,990
我们在这里

1948
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:42,590
空间足够吗？

1949
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,670
-我没跳舞……   -很多年了

1950
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:51,230
我知道，我也是

1951
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,410
胸罩？

1952
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:07,150
看到没有？你还不是很落伍

1953
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:12,990
你很好

1954
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:17,690
在伐木高中，
很多女孩子想跟我约会

1955
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,600
我会跳摇摆舞

1956
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:27,740
你喷了什么？

1957
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:29,430
老式香水

1958
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:32,100
菲尔说是永恒的名牌

1959
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,720
-那你是不是想做？

1960
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,230
想做什么？

1961
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:54,560
吻我

1962
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:56,900
-是的   -很好

1963
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:11,620
亲吻和跳舞技术都一流

1964
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,380
我很乐观

1965
00:48:22,430 --> 00:48:25,160
我还是走好了

1966
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:28,260
只是个钟而已

1967
00:48:28,330 --> 00:48:30,560
晚安

1968
00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:38,300
那么

1969
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:40,970
我想这是正式的对吗？我们的约会

1970
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:43,040
或者我们以后
可以再一起玩宾果游戏？

1971
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:46,110
我对宾果已经厌倦了

1972
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:49,120
或者我们应该
尝试下你的免下车电影院

1973
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:52,590
晚安

1974
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:15,250
上课前……

1975
00:49:15,350 --> 00:49:19,580
朗达和贾斯廷
会带大家进行集体冥想

1976
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:21,980
真棒

1977
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:27,790
我们将要做的事
是把自己的内在频率发放出来

1978
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,700
大家手连手……

1979
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:35,200
闭上眼睛

1980
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:41,670
放松，然后深呼吸

1981
00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:46,710
现在不要说话，尝试感觉……

1982
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:51,340
其他人的感受

1983
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:54,440
发出你的信息电流

1984
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:58,250
同时接收其他人的电流

1985
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:00,930
感受得到吗？

1986
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:07,060
现在睁开眼睛，你们感觉到什么？

1987
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:10,260
我感觉到亨赛特臂力很大

1988
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:13,600
我唯一感觉到的是朗达

1989
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:16,000
她跟我是那么的合拍

1990
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:20,240
没错，那正是我发出的信息

1991
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:22,540
我感觉到你全身散发出……

1992
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:24,780
和谐和融合的气息

1993
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:28,920
薇达，你感觉到什么？

1994
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,820
我只是感觉到贾斯廷的倒拉刺
（指甲旁的逆刺皮）    -不，薇达

1995
00:50:32,890 --> 00:50:35,120
这不是我们要寻找的东西

1996
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:37,790
一些倒拉刺完全微不足道

1997
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:41,160
我灵魂深处有什么……

1998
00:50:41,230 --> 00:50:43,570
感觉我的气息

1999
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:46,230
我想我做不到

2000
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:49,810
在来一次

2001
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,810
大家一起拉手

2002
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,720
奶奶的大脚趾上曾经长过倒拉刺

2003
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:00,510
受到感染后，影响到她的喉咙

2004
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:02,350
把她唱歌的嗓子都破坏了

2005
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:05,880
我想奶奶绝不会
认为这是微不足道的

2006
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:05,020
一些莴苣

2007
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:09,990
拿莴苣的时候小心其他的菜

2008
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:14,460
我认出你们两个的背影

2009
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,530
我们来买野餐的食物

2010
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,130
我也是。介意我加入吗？

2011
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,690
热烈欢迎

2012
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:30,400
-这么多土豆   -是为雪莉
最喜欢的土豆沙拉准备的

2013
00:52:30,510 --> 00:52:33,840
我很期待。天哪！

2014
00:52:33,910 --> 00:52:37,350
-小心点！   -对不起

2015
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:41,410
我很久没有在独立日烧烤了

2016
00:52:41,490 --> 00:52:45,750
爸爸，你不是说过想买梅肉干吗？

2017
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:49,090
把你想要的都放进车里吧

2018
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:52,200
我不知道她今天怎么了

2019
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:56,000
我想要点橄榄

2020
00:52:56,070 --> 00:52:58,760
我过去很喜欢玩肯特和巴比娃娃

2021
00:52:58,870 --> 00:53:02,330
我最喜欢肯特。然后到圣诞节
我把他们放到旅行车上去

2022
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,910
他们需要做的只是把自己推出车外

2023
00:53:05,010 --> 00:53:09,240
那么当他们跳下悬崖时
我就不会那么伤心了

2024
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:13,220
穿过黑色的夜

2025
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:17,310
证实我们的旗帜仍然在飘扬

2026
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:22,230
噢，那星光灿烂的

2027
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:26,890
旗帜仍然在风中飘扬

2028
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:57,160
我早告诉过你，别加那么多煤炭

2029
00:53:57,230 --> 00:54:00,830
-你把它们都烤焦了
-我正在改善

2030
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:02,490
你想来烧吗？

2031
00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:05,540
为什么你不事先把煤炭
按分量装在小袋子里呢？

2032
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:07,660
把其他食物拿出来，
别总是抓我小辫子

2033
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:09,470
大厨师，进行地怎样了？

2034
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:12,540
-我喜欢你的围裙   -谢谢

2035
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:16,210
-可以吃了吗？
-不，亲爱的，还没准备好

2036
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:18,810
-什么 时候才能吃？
-很快，亲爱的

2037
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,820
-有多快？   -就快

2038
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:23,820
很热，你会烧掉鼻子的。小心

2039
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:33,300
-就来了，妈妈   -回来吃晚餐！

2040
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:39,140
咚咚咚……

2041
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:40,730
谢谢主赐我食物

2042
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:43,970
-开动了    -你先来吧

2043
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:45,480
雪莉，喜欢海鲜吗？

2044
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:46,880
为什么这样问？

2045
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,940
看--

2046
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:50,880
很吸引人

2047
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:55,850
失陪

2048
00:54:59,190 --> 00:55:02,090
嘿，谁住在这里？亚当斯家族？

2049
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:05,560
-丹尼，你来这里干什么？
-我来干什么？

2050
00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:08,860
嗨，拉夫・丹尼，你怎样找到我的？

2051
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:12,430
你告诉了所有人你来这里
我来要回我的车子的

2052
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:15,530
他们间关系恶劣

2053
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:18,110
我一直住在那里面，旅游车是我的

2054
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:20,680
“共有财产”，律师是这么说的

2055
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:22,410
是属于我们两个的

2056
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:25,540
-而不是雪莉的私人娱乐设施
-小声点

2057
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:27,550
我的老板正看着我们

2058
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:29,950
对此我感到很惊奇

2059
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:33,720
-我想我现在必须介绍你   -好

2060
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:43,770
薇达・桑特夫斯？真难听

2061
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,030
我喜欢我的名字

2062
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:49,730
这是丹尼和拉夫。他们是
迪诺・拉菲尔沙龙的老板

2063
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:52,040
我们结过婚

2064
00:55:52,110 --> 00:55:54,080
你来这里把她带回去吗？

2065
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:59,550
很高兴认识你们
我们有热狗和肉排，一起吃吧

2066
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:04,250
-不用了，我来这里
因为我的太太   -前任！

2067
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:07,550
我的前任太太
似乎偷走了我的旅游车

2068
00:56:08,590 --> 00:56:10,820
他在胡言乱语

2069
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:12,520
-我保证   -我不同意

2070
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,900
我有财产分单的说明说在手

2071
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:18,030
妈的，这是我的租契

2072
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:21,230
我最近总是很健忘，越来越老了

2073
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:24,140
什么？

2074
00:56:24,210 --> 00:56:27,580
我知道你遭受严重的损失……

2075
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:30,440
并且无法得到平静下来

2076
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:35,040
我建议你保持
对旅游车的美好记忆……

2077
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:37,680
度过的假期，看过的风景

2078
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,490
这些日子已经过去了
但是会永远活在你的心中

2079
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:42,950
他在跟你说话？

2080
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:46,400
你说的都是些蠢话！

2081
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:48,490
你不可以拿走她的车

2082
00:56:48,570 --> 00:56:51,330
-不可以？
-那是她的家，她住的地方

2083
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,630
是吗？好，你回去烧烤吧

2084
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:55,730
-给钥匙我   -很痛！

2085
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:00,710
你为什么这样做？

2086
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:02,870
-你是谁？   -我是他弟弟

2087
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:07,480
-那我们将常见面了    -为什么？

2088
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:10,080
因为如果他敢再来抢雪莉的车……

2089
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,280
我会把他埋在我的前院

2090
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:19,230
你爸爸是个野蛮人

2091
00:57:21,330 --> 00:57:22,930
再见，拉夫

2092
00:57:28,610 --> 00:57:31,800
你真厉害

2093
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:34,140
那真是你的车吗？

2094
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:47,950
-我们在后院可以看到烟火吗？
-当然可以

2095
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,490
在那里

2096
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:55,930
他们每年看起来都一样

2097
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:58,870
看

2098
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:04,830
你爱过他吗？

2099
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:12,550
我不会嫁给自己不爱的人

2100
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:17,050
他定是很喜欢雪莉

2101
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:19,960
我从没见过他打人

2102
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:23,090
他喜欢她

2103
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:26,790
他爱雪莉吗？

2104
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:28,300
应该是

2105
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:33,070
你喜欢雪莉吗？

2106
00:58:33,170 --> 00:58:35,110
是的，我喜欢她

2107
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:37,770
我想她很适合你爸爸

2108
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:39,310
为什么？

2109
00:58:40,410 --> 00:58:43,440
自从你妈妈死后，他总是死气沉沉

2110
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:47,980
但那之前，他是个很有趣的人

2111
00:58:48,050 --> 00:58:49,490
真的吗？

2112
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:55,750
现在当我看到他和雪莉在一起……

2113
00:58:56,830 --> 00:58:59,460
他看起来像以前的哈利 了

2114
00:58:59,530 --> 00:59:01,470
我爸爸有趣？

2115
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:07,440
他不是个马克思兄弟，
但总能让我开怀大笑

2116
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:12,640
我伯伯参加过朝鲜战争

2117
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:15,040
他脑子里还有块子弹碎片

2118
00:59:15,110 --> 00:59:17,450
爸爸也说他不会回来了

2119
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:22,350
一天晚上，我们从他牙齿缝里捡到
一个俄克拉荷马州的收音机

2120
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:24,360
真奇妙

2121
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:32,920
-什么？   -你看到了吗？

2122
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,060
-没有   -就在那儿

2123
00:59:35,130 --> 00:59:37,900
没有鸡骨卡在你喉咙里

2124
00:59:39,070 --> 00:59:41,940
韦尔奇医生，
你确定那些奖状都是你的吗？

2125
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:46,640
你把水注进去，像这样

2126
00:59:46,710 --> 00:59:49,440
你就得到一把水枪了

2127
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:51,610
真棒，我可以拿一把给薇达吗？

2128
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:56,710
我问你一个问题

2129
00:59:56,790 --> 00:59:59,450
薇达告诉过你她为什么
这么频繁地到这儿来吗？

2130
00:59:59,530 --> 01:00:02,090
-她说自己就要死了    -你相信吗？

2131
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:04,990
你觉得她为什么要那样说？

2132
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:07,620
她害怕家里的那些死人

2133
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:11,140
你知道那句话“如果你害怕
他们，就加入他们”

2134
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,760
如果她成为其中一分子，
她就不那么害怕了

2135
01:00:13,870 --> 01:00:18,310
知道吗？我觉得她有你这样
一个好朋友是很大的福分

2136
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:20,740
她是我最好的朋友

2137
01:00:21,810 --> 01:00:23,810
薇达小姐，你觉得怎么样？

2138
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:27,350
好得不能再好了

2139
01:00:29,590 --> 01:00:31,580
猜猜我们得了什么？   -什么？

2140
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:35,960
-这个！   -嘿，你！我要捉住你！

2141
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:39,100
把那个给我！

2142
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,600
-我捉到你了 ！   -才没有呢

2143
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:47,970
-哇   -怎么 了？

2144
01:00:48,070 --> 01:00:50,630
-那里有个大蜂巢   -那又怎样？

2145
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:52,680
退后

2146
01:00:54,310 --> 01:00:57,110
你疯了吗？你会被针的！

2147
01:00:57,180 --> 01:00:58,810
你说的对，我们把它打下来吧

2148
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:02,410
-你为什么要玩这个？ -因为它
建造得很巧妙，我想看一下

2149
01:01:10,060 --> 01:01:11,320
行了 ！

2150
01:01:12,630 --> 01:01:15,690
我的情绪戒指掉了 ！我要找回它！

2151
01:01:22,710 --> 01:01:25,040
它们是活的！快逃命！

2152
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:41,820
-加速！它们在追赶我们！
-我在加速

2153
01:01:41,890 --> 01:01:44,290
-快！   -跳下水里！

2154
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:46,830
-我还穿着衣服呢！   -快跳！

2155
01:02:01,910 --> 01:02:04,640
-薇达，是你吗？   -是

2156
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:07,480
我们今晚会去参加狂欢节

2157
01:02:07,550 --> 01:02:09,990
做好准备10分钟内出门

2158
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:12,680
雪莉会跟我们一起去

2159
01:02:22,630 --> 01:02:26,930
薇达，你最喜欢的游戏是什么
-我喜欢奇异的表演

2160
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:32,070
我知道，我们去看杂技表演吧

2161
01:02:32,180 --> 01:02:35,310
你爸爸不适合坐过山车

2162
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:37,410
在这里吃东西要格外小心

2163
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:40,710
有一次我和两个表弟参加
狂欢会，戴维和弗兰克

2164
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:44,120
他们吃了很多热狗，
第二天就肾炎发作了

2165
01:02:44,190 --> 01:02:48,180
肾炎不会因为吃热狗而发病的

2166
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:51,960
我所知道的是，
第二天他们发高烧……

2167
01:02:52,030 --> 01:02:54,500
脸变得很肿

2168
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:57,160
使医学界觉得很奇怪，
他们最终上了杂志

2169
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:03,370
是真的，是那本“医学技术”。
不，是“大众医学”

2170
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:05,600
我忘了，是“大众”

2171
01:03:05,710 --> 01:03:10,440
-他们想击中那可怜的小东西
-小心别击中鱼

2172
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,450
沿曲线扔过去

2173
01:03:15,620 --> 01:03:17,750
我不知道哪个球是我的了

2174
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:20,950
-我赢了 ！   -很好！

2175
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:23,520
我们有一位胜利者了 ！给你，小女孩

2176
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,560
看到这是多么容易了吗？

2177
01:03:25,630 --> 01:03:27,660
这些金鱼真漂亮

2178
01:03:29,370 --> 01:03:30,960
你从哪里得到这个戒指的？

2179
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:35,700
你赢的吗？

2180
01:03:42,010 --> 01:03:43,610
我们有点事情要跟你说

2181
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:52,360
是一个好消息

2182
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:54,450
我们就要结婚了

2183
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,020
我的鱼！

2184
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:05,530
我们会在夏季结束前举行婚礼

2185
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:09,160
你会没事的，小鱼

2186
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:13,040
你要换一条鱼吗？

2187
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:16,540
不用了，它很好

2188
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:21,420
金鱼是很念旧的动物

2189
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:24,010
别担心，我不会要另一条鱼的

2190
01:04:27,390 --> 01:04:29,050
是碰碰车！

2191
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:34,500
只要50美分-
半美元-5个一角硬币……

2192
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:38,800
保证刺激又好玩

2193
01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:42,530
这里有碰碰车！快过来玩

2194
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:46,810
碰碰车！来游乐场一定要玩的游戏！

2195
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:49,280
我会在车上睡着

2196
01:04:49,350 --> 01:04:51,280
我陪你玩吧

2197
01:04:51,350 --> 01:04:53,280
太好了！来吧

2198
01:04:58,190 --> 01:04:59,380
我坐蓝色那部！

2199
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:06,870
我回去捉你的

2200
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:16,900
薇达，手要抓紧方向盘

2201
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:57,310
小心！

2202
01:05:58,380 --> 01:05:59,580
小心点！

2203
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:35,580
-可以叫汤姆斯出来吗？
-当然，进来吧

2204
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:41,560
-去骑车吗？   -好的

2205
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:45,190
-整理好床铺了吗？   -整好了

2206
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:47,490
-真的？   -真的

2207
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:50,930
过来，你嘴边还有
牛奶留下的小胡子哦

2208
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:55,030
走吧

2209
01:06:56,940 --> 01:06:59,340
-妈妈，再见   -玩得开心点，孩子

2210
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:06,850
-我要离家出走   -去哪里？

2211
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:10,910
加利福尼亚。我会去好莱坞与
布雷迪家庭（连续剧）的人住一齐

2212
01:07:10,990 --> 01:07:14,020
-我也想和他们住在一起
-你不行

2213
01:07:14,090 --> 01:07:18,690
他们已经有太多孩子了。你只有
住进鹧鸪家庭（美国乐队）里

2214
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:20,530
真的？

2215
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:37,310
好了

2216
01:07:47,330 --> 01:07:49,730
-起来   -我已经厌倦了离家出走

2217
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:54,490
此外，我们经过这里两次了
其实我们根本离不开这里

2218
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:02,040
-你为什么要逃走？
-我爸爸送了个戒指给雪莉

2219
01:08:02,110 --> 01:08:04,370
哇，是个什么样的戒指？

2220
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:08,400
你反应真迟钝，是个订婚戒指

2221
01:08:08,510 --> 01:08:12,310
他们要结婚了？你会有妈妈了

2222
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:16,150
-我不喜欢她   -我喜欢，她很幽默

2223
01:08:17,090 --> 01:08:19,460
他喜欢雪莉多于喜欢我

2224
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:29,270
-我很饿了
-那就回家去吧，小宝宝

2225
01:08:29,330 --> 01:08:31,800
我真的要回去了，妈妈会担心的

2226
01:08:31,870 --> 01:08:34,270
走吧，那，你这个朋友可真好

2227
01:08:34,370 --> 01:08:36,900
你可以去我家吃晚饭

2228
01:08:37,010 --> 01:08:39,140
不，我要躲起来

2229
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:41,440
再见

2230
01:09:39,370 --> 01:09:41,340
那位绅士是否会留下来？

2231
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:46,440
或许你没有听清楚我的话

2232
01:09:46,510 --> 01:09:49,380
全部的财产都会归你所有了

2233
01:09:49,450 --> 01:09:52,420
-20,000,000美元   -我明白

2234
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:54,510
真是一大笔钱，对吗？

2235
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:58,390
-当然   -我不明白
他为什么把钱留给我

2236
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:00,520
我不需要这些钱

2237
01:10:02,030 --> 01:10:06,930
在学校我们学过：有些人会偷走
林德伯格家的小孩子（彼得潘）

2238
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:10,370
我今晚决定大开窗户睡觉

2239
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:16,270
噢！天哪！

2240
01:10:16,370 --> 01:10:18,370
爸爸！

2241
01:10:27,450 --> 01:10:29,780
怎么了？

2242
01:10:29,850 --> 01:10:32,080
-爸爸呢？
-他刚刚离开，发生什么事了？

2243
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:34,520
-我在流血   -你指的是什么？

2244
01:10:34,590 --> 01:10:36,320
我不需要你的帮助！

2245
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:39,190
是在上洗手间时发现的吗？

2246
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,300
-你多少岁了？   -11岁半

2247
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:47,300
没什么事的。我们上楼谈一下

2248
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:53,040
我爸爸和妈妈做那件事？

2249
01:10:53,140 --> 01:10:55,580
事实上是很美妙的

2250
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:59,050
所以才会有了薇达啊

2251
01:10:59,050 --> 01:11:01,110
我想那很讨厌

2252
01:11:01,190 --> 01:11:03,880
相信我，以后你就会有不同的想法

2253
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:07,950
应该是汤姆斯，我现在不想见他

2254
01:11:09,830 --> 01:11:14,320
真不公平，男孩子不用面对这些

2255
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:19,930
嗨，你可以出来玩吗？

2256
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:22,510
-我不知道   -出来吧

2257
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:25,300
今天很热，我们可以去游泳

2258
01:11:27,210 --> 01:11:29,810
不！快走！

2259
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:34,680
5到10天内别来找我！

2260
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:55,460
我去一下洗手间，呆会见

2261
01:11:57,510 --> 01:11:59,370
留在这里

2262
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:58,930
现在是2点45分

2263
01:12:59,670 --> 01:13:02,200
什么人也没有

2264
01:13:02,310 --> 01:13:04,870
只有你和我

2265
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:07,970
乔，听我说

2266
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:12,310
一个小故事

2267
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:15,580
我们开始了

2268
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:21,290
-情节很有趣   -很抱歉

2269
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:25,890
-所以给我的宝贝唱一首
-来，没事了

2270
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:29,990
-再到路旁唱一首
-非常，非常抱歉

2271
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:37,130
你到底在干什么？

2272
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:39,210
你应该看好奶奶的！

2273
01:13:39,310 --> 01:13:43,110
你知不知道里面的人有多伤心？

2274
01:13:56,860 --> 01:13:59,830
你觉得人们为什么要结婚呢？

2275
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:02,990
当你长大了，
这是人生里必要的一部分

2276
01:14:03,070 --> 01:14:05,500
我要嫁给比斯勒先生

2277
01:14:05,570 --> 01:14:08,440
你不可以跟老师结婚，是违法的

2278
01:14:08,540 --> 01:14:10,630
-可以的   -不可以的

2279
01:14:10,740 --> 01:14:13,800
因为你们结婚的话，他就会
给你A，那就不公平了

2280
01:14:13,910 --> 01:14:15,850
乱说

2281
01:14:18,980 --> 01:14:20,640
你试过亲吻吗？

2282
01:14:22,150 --> 01:14:24,090
像电视里那样？

2283
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:32,360
或者我们该试一下，
看看有什么大不了 的

2284
01:14:32,430 --> 01:14:35,230
我不知道怎样亲吻

2285
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:37,290
像这样，先在手臂上练习

2286
01:14:38,370 --> 01:14:40,530
这样？

2287
01:14:43,710 --> 01:14:47,240
练习够了。闭上你的眼睛

2288
01:14:47,350 --> 01:14:49,250
那我会看不到东西的

2289
01:14:49,310 --> 01:14:51,440
快点

2290
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:58,280
数到3

2291
01:14:59,220 --> 01:15:00,890
1

2292
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:04,190
2，2个半

2293
01:15:04,260 --> 01:15:06,460
3

2294
01:15:13,740 --> 01:15:16,830
说点什么吧，太静了

2295
01:15:19,810 --> 01:15:21,710
快点！

2296
01:15:22,910 --> 01:15:25,210
我向美国国旗……

2297
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:27,250
表达我的忠诚

2298
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:29,880
我忠于美国民众

2299
01:15:29,950 --> 01:15:31,980
一个国家，在上帝的指引下……

2300
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:35,360
团结一致，给人民
带来自由民主和公正

2301
01:15:57,280 --> 01:16:00,340
-不要把这告诉别人   -你也是

2302
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:02,680
让我们吐唾液发誓

2303
01:16:05,590 --> 01:16:07,560
-明天见   -明天见

2304
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:11,790
怎么了？

2305
01:16:12,930 --> 01:16:15,760
-你会考虑我吗？   -关于什么？

2306
01:16:16,830 --> 01:16:19,860
如果你不跟比斯勒先生结婚的话

2307
01:16:21,710 --> 01:16:23,570
我想我会的

2308
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:27,200
走开！

2309
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:21,350
-你在干什么？   -喂我的鱼

2310
01:18:25,860 --> 01:18:28,660
是你在游乐场赢的鱼吗？

2311
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,940
它长大了

2312
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:40,700
过来坐一下

2313
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:49,050
汤姆斯昨晚出了些意外

2314
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:53,290
他碰到了蜂巢

2315
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:57,730
我警告过他别去招惹
那些蜜蜂，他被针到了吗？

2316
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:04,000
或者我该去探望他，骂他几句

2317
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:08,760
不，亲爱的。你不可以

2318
01:19:11,980 --> 01:19:13,440
为什么不可以？

2319
01:19:16,450 --> 01:19:19,080
他对蜜蜂敏感

2320
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:22,750
他没什么事，对吗？

2321
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:26,990
太多蜜蜂了

2322
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:51,250
亲爱的，你觉得怎么样？

2323
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:55,010
-我无法呼吸   -放松，让我看一下

2324
01:19:55,090 --> 01:19:57,110
没事的，过来。我帮你检查一下

2325
01:19:57,190 --> 01:19:59,120
好女孩

2326
01:19:59,190 --> 01:20:01,160
很痛！

2327
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:04,630
-很痛！   -哪里痛？

2328
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:08,860
蜜蜂针了我！我要窒息了 ！

2329
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:40,860
如果你饿了，门口有食物

2330
01:20:48,810 --> 01:20:50,360
薇达在家吗？

2331
01:20:50,470 --> 01:20:55,140
在，但是她现在很伤心，不想见人

2332
01:20:56,210 --> 01:20:58,340
我叫朱迪，是薇达的同学

2333
01:20:58,420 --> 01:21:01,110
汤姆斯的死很遗憾。
我是来叫薇达不要太悲伤的

2334
01:21:02,350 --> 01:21:04,340
过几天她可能会慢慢恢复的

2335
01:21:04,420 --> 01:21:05,750
你可以跟她说我来过吗？

2336
01:21:06,590 --> 01:21:09,150
-好   -谢谢

2337
01:21:09,230 --> 01:21:10,820
再见

2338
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:20,030
-你好，哈利   -你好，莫斯牧师

2339
01:21:20,140 --> 01:21:24,010
我知道赛内特一家很感激
你为他们处理得那么周到

2340
01:21:35,820 --> 01:21:38,020
我看到你把食物吃了

2341
01:21:39,190 --> 01:21:42,130
你应该下来参加葬礼

2342
01:21:42,190 --> 01:21:44,290
或者会有所帮助的

2343
01:21:54,970 --> 01:21:56,910
她不肯出来

2344
01:21:58,340 --> 01:22:00,070
已经一整天了

2345
01:22:01,610 --> 01:22:04,310
你应该做点什么

2346
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:09,580
-追悼会就要开始了
-她只有11岁！

2347
01:22:09,650 --> 01:22:11,590
而且她唯一的朋友刚死了！

2348
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:13,650
我知道！你到底想我怎样做？

2349
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:15,990
别把自己藏起来！

2350
01:22:16,060 --> 01:22:18,030
你在逃避

2351
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:24,000
我到这里来时，
与死人作伴并没有吓倒我

2352
01:22:26,070 --> 01:22:28,370
我看到一个家庭住在这里……

2353
01:22:29,470 --> 01:22:32,240
我以为……

2354
01:22:32,310 --> 01:22:37,250
虽然我没有家，但至少
可以在一个家庭里工作

2355
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:40,750
或者，偶尔，会被邀请一起吃晚餐

2356
01:22:40,820 --> 01:22:44,910
那次的晚餐被汽车事件破坏了……

2357
01:22:44,990 --> 01:22:46,920
现在是一个小男孩碰到蜂巢--

2358
01:22:46,990 --> 01:22:50,930
我并不是叫你停止思考或感受

2359
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:55,460
但这世界不仅仅只有死人

2360
01:22:57,540 --> 01:22:59,400
别忽略那些活生生有思想的人

2361
01:23:00,870 --> 01:23:03,100
尤其是你的女儿

2362
01:23:05,780 --> 01:23:08,970
打扰一下，牧师要开始了

2363
01:23:09,050 --> 01:23:11,740
谢谢你，阿瑟

2364
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:27,960
今天我们到这来……

2365
01:23:28,030 --> 01:23:30,400
悼念汤姆斯・詹姆士・塞内特

2366
01:23:30,470 --> 01:23:34,460
他生于1961年5月7日……

2367
01:23:34,570 --> 01:23:36,230
在宾西法尼亚州，麦迪逊市

2368
01:23:36,340 --> 01:23:38,310
深爱他的父母……

2369
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:40,310
查尔斯与苏珊・塞内特……

2370
01:23:40,380 --> 01:23:43,580
他的祖父母，
威廉和格洛丽亚・塞内特

2371
01:23:43,650 --> 01:23:45,620
杰拉尔德和马乔里・费恩……

2372
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:49,310
以及众多的亲朋好友

2373
01:23:49,390 --> 01:23:53,620
汤姆斯将会长存于麦迪逊纪念公墓

2374
01:23:53,690 --> 01:23:58,290
塞内特家庭请我在追悼会前致辞

2375
01:24:00,730 --> 01:24:04,360
我想我必须表达……

2376
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:06,770
我深深的惋惜

2377
01:24:07,870 --> 01:24:11,430
一个词不停环绕在我的脑海……

2378
01:24:11,540 --> 01:24:12,980
那就是“为什么？”

2379
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:16,040
上帝为什么选择把这个
可爱的小男孩从我们身边带走

2380
01:24:16,910 --> 01:24:20,870
为什么？我想我可以告诉大家答案

2381
01:24:20,950 --> 01:24:22,380
原因是……

2382
01:24:22,450 --> 01:24:26,650
上帝由于特别的原因选择了汤姆斯

2383
01:24:28,490 --> 01:24:33,190
我们应该感到安慰因为汤姆斯
现在由上帝照顾了

2384
01:24:33,260 --> 01:24:38,070
他再也不会感到悲伤或痛苦

2385
01:24:38,140 --> 01:24:40,400
那里没有黑夜

2386
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:43,440
只有欢乐和幸福

2387
01:24:43,510 --> 01:24:46,600
我将为大家读圣经里的一个篇章

2388
01:24:48,210 --> 01:24:51,080
马太福音19卷

2389
01:24:51,150 --> 01:24:53,170
孩子被带到基督的面前……

2390
01:24:53,250 --> 01:24:57,620
期望得到他的祝福

2391
01:24:57,690 --> 01:24:59,590
门徒们走过来

2392
01:25:00,620 --> 01:25:05,030
基督说：让孩子们到我这里来

2393
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:06,860
别把他们藏起来

2394
01:25:06,930 --> 01:25:09,900
天堂之国是属于他们的

2395
01:25:11,740 --> 01:25:14,730
他把手……

2396
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:16,830
放在孩子们的头上

2397
01:25:16,940 --> 01:25:20,000
让我们默哀

2398
01:25:21,450 --> 01:25:24,140
想去爬树吗？

2399
01:25:24,220 --> 01:25:27,670
他的脸受伤了 ！他的眼镜呢？

2400
01:25:27,750 --> 01:25:30,450
他没有眼镜会什么也看不见！

2401
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:32,460
帮他戴上眼镜！

2402
01:25:36,630 --> 01:25:41,260
-他想当杂技演员
-他死了，亲爱的

2403
01:25:46,370 --> 01:25:48,000
等一下！

2404
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:06,750
我正想到你家去

2405
01:26:06,820 --> 01:26:10,090
你还好吗？
对汤姆斯的事我感到很遗憾

2406
01:26:11,930 --> 01:26:14,230
不要说他的事！

2407
01:26:16,730 --> 01:26:18,700
好，我们不谈他

2408
01:26:18,770 --> 01:26:22,570
朗达和贾斯廷说我
应该告诉人们我的想法

2409
01:26:23,540 --> 01:26:26,070
到这儿来，坐下吧

2410
01:26:31,950 --> 01:26:33,920
我爱你

2411
01:26:35,150 --> 01:26:38,550
我像我爸爸爱雪莉一样爱你

2412
01:26:38,620 --> 01:26:40,560
我想住在这里

2413
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:46,030
我想你爸爸会想念你的

2414
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:49,290
不，他不会的。我不可以回家了

2415
01:26:49,370 --> 01:26:53,390
亨特，我找不到另一边的耳环了

2416
01:26:54,270 --> 01:26:55,860
这是薇达

2417
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:01,570
-打扰了    -我们要谈一下

2418
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:07,920
那是谁？

2419
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:10,920
她是苏珊娜

2420
01:27:16,630 --> 01:27:18,960
我们秋季就要结婚了

2421
01:27:20,130 --> 01:27:23,030
我打算下个礼拜带她到
写作课介绍给你们认识的

2422
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:25,730
我想让她听你读诗

2423
01:27:27,610 --> 01:27:29,770
亲爱的，我也很喜欢汤姆斯的

2424
01:27:29,870 --> 01:27:31,810
-别这样！   -别碰我！

2425
01:27:35,050 --> 01:27:36,980
亲爱的，别--

2426
01:28:09,550 --> 01:28:12,480
你觉得人们为什么要结婚呢？

2427
01:28:12,550 --> 01:28:15,040
当你长大后，
这是人生里必须的一部分

2428
01:28:19,990 --> 01:28:21,920
跟你爸爸一起的是谁？

2429
01:28:22,730 --> 01:28:24,660
我妈妈

2430
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:29,320
我以后要当杂技演员

2431
01:28:32,300 --> 01:28:35,000
你会考虑我吗？

2432
01:28:35,110 --> 01:28:37,970
如果你不跟比斯勒先生结婚的话

2433
01:28:42,510 --> 01:28:44,880
现在我们是一辈子的结拜兄弟了

2434
01:29:03,130 --> 01:29:05,930
-我们还没有找到她
-她独自一人在外面！

2435
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:09,060
-我们会继续搜寻
-从早上开始我们就一直在找她

2436
01:29:09,170 --> 01:29:10,610
她的老师说--

2437
01:29:10,670 --> 01:29:12,640
我知道，你告诉过我了

2438
01:29:19,220 --> 01:29:21,780
你还好吗？

2439
01:29:24,460 --> 01:29:28,260
我应该告诉汤姆斯
他是我最好的朋友

2440
01:29:29,330 --> 01:29:31,260
我相信他是知道的

2441
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:45,700
我从你的曲奇罐里偷了一些钱……

2442
01:29:45,810 --> 01:29:47,830
为了交写作课的学费

2443
01:29:51,820 --> 01:29:54,680
-无所谓的   -我会还给你的

2444
01:29:54,750 --> 01:29:58,620
而且我不会再去上课了

2445
01:30:00,420 --> 01:30:02,260
告诉你吧

2446
01:30:02,330 --> 01:30:06,790
你将会读你写的
第一本诗集给我听，好吗？

2447
01:30:06,860 --> 01:30:08,920
好，我保证

2448
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,930
睡吧

2449
01:30:32,390 --> 01:30:33,950
晚安

2450
01:30:52,940 --> 01:30:54,500
她回来了

2451
01:31:12,700 --> 01:31:15,720
-是我害死了妈妈吗？   -什么？

2452
01:31:19,340 --> 01:31:22,860
蜜蜂杀死了汤姆斯，
而我杀死了妈妈

2453
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:35,080
那不是你的错

2454
01:31:36,850 --> 01:31:39,820
不是任何人的错

2455
01:31:39,890 --> 01:31:41,820
事情的发生没有人能够阻挡

2456
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:48,330
我找到这个

2457
01:31:53,700 --> 01:31:55,760
我差点忘了这张相片

2458
01:31:55,870 --> 01:31:58,710
-你在哪看到的？   -在车库里

2459
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:03,610
你妈妈最喜欢那辆车

2460
01:32:04,450 --> 01:32:06,250
妈妈是怎样的？

2461
01:32:08,190 --> 01:32:10,280
她很漂亮

2462
01:32:10,350 --> 01:32:12,290
温柔

2463
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:14,290
你长着和她一样的眼睛

2464
01:32:16,930 --> 01:32:18,860
她很喜欢笑

2465
01:32:21,870 --> 01:32:24,530
有时候你的笑声跟她一模一样

2466
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:26,030
真的？

2467
01:32:28,140 --> 01:32:31,270
你知道她发现
怀了你之后做了什么事吗？

2468
01:32:33,210 --> 01:32:36,080
她回家来把这房间油成了粉红色

2469
01:32:37,450 --> 01:32:39,750
她很肯定自己会生个女孩子

2470
01:32:39,820 --> 01:32:42,280
你想念她吗？

2471
01:32:45,460 --> 01:32:47,580
这么多年以来……

2472
01:32:47,660 --> 01:32:49,390
我都非常想念她

2473
01:32:50,790 --> 01:32:56,060
即使是现在，
当我看到一朵美丽的花……

2474
01:32:56,130 --> 01:32:58,730
或者她喜欢的日落，
我都会非常伤心

2475
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:03,640
每次我去爬树，
我也非常想念汤姆斯

2476
01:33:04,610 --> 01:33:06,270
那很好

2477
01:33:06,380 --> 01:33:08,540
回忆是很好的，亲爱的

2478
01:33:10,380 --> 01:33:13,320
对不起

2479
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:17,740
我以前总不想你留下太多的
回忆。因为失去时会痛彻心扉

2480
01:33:20,660 --> 01:33:22,590
我只是无法……

2481
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:29,260
你是个好女孩，
我想你过得开开心心

2482
01:33:30,330 --> 01:33:32,860
而不是变成像我一样忧郁的老头子

2483
01:33:40,340 --> 01:33:42,280
明天见

2484
01:33:45,750 --> 01:33:47,180
爸爸

2485
01:33:48,650 --> 01:33:50,590
像你一样也不错

2486
01:34:17,410 --> 01:34:19,350
你最近好吗？

2487
01:34:22,050 --> 01:34:24,540
有些时候我觉得自己还能顶住……

2488
01:34:24,620 --> 01:34:26,890
另一些日子里……

2489
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:30,590
我甚至怀疑
自己可以怎样撑过这一天

2490
01:34:30,660 --> 01:34:34,860
我知道这很傻，但有时
我觉得他只是去了夏令营

2491
01:34:36,330 --> 01:34:38,270
薇达怎么样了？

2492
01:34:38,340 --> 01:34:40,030
她好了很多

2493
01:34:40,100 --> 01:34:42,070
她在里面

2494
01:34:54,120 --> 01:34:56,780
我一直想见你

2495
01:35:00,290 --> 01:35:02,490
汤姆带着这个

2496
01:35:03,730 --> 01:35:05,720
我想你会想留着它的

2497
01:35:17,410 --> 01:35:19,670
对他来说，你是那么重要的朋友

2498
01:35:20,910 --> 01:35:22,900
我希望你仍然会来探望我

2499
01:35:23,010 --> 01:35:26,380
我一定会的，我保证

2500
01:35:36,390 --> 01:35:38,990
汤姆斯会很好的

2501
01:35:39,060 --> 01:35:41,430
我妈妈会照顾他的

2502
01:35:44,670 --> 01:35:46,600
谢谢你

2503
01:35:55,580 --> 01:35:58,980
充满智慧的结晶……

2504
01:35:59,020 --> 01:36:01,640
诗人的每行字句都很闻名

2505
01:36:03,220 --> 01:36:07,250
它们像暴风雨一般
冲刷我们的灵魂……

2506
01:36:07,320 --> 01:36:10,760
青年早逝……

2507
01:36:10,830 --> 01:36:13,090
但精神长存

2508
01:36:16,430 --> 01:36:19,270
最后一堂课我给你们的建议是：

2509
01:36:21,370 --> 01:36:23,970
创造暴风雨

2510
01:36:24,070 --> 01:36:26,940
什么意思？

2511
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:33,180
我指，要有情感的冲击……

2512
01:36:34,950 --> 01:36:36,820
要创新

2513
01:36:37,890 --> 01:36:40,620
并且勇敢地表达出 自己的情感

2514
01:36:50,030 --> 01:36:54,160
我真想念你！来，给我一个拥抱

2515
01:36:57,340 --> 01:36:59,900
我以为你今天不会来了

2516
01:37:04,680 --> 01:37:06,550
我一定来

2517
01:37:06,620 --> 01:37:08,550
我来读我的诗给大家听

2518
01:37:08,620 --> 01:37:10,550
热烈欢迎

2519
01:37:17,330 --> 01:37:20,320
惦念你-我亲爱的朋友

2520
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:23,330
为什么你总是哀愁和流泪？

2521
01:37:23,400 --> 01:37:26,370
因为某天他离你而去？

2522
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:29,170
因为他无法停留的脚步？

2523
01:37:30,270 --> 01:37:32,740
他曾在那树枝上唱歌

2524
01:37:32,810 --> 01:37:36,470
你仍在怀念那天快乐的时光吗？

2525
01:37:36,550 --> 01:37:38,740
你在那树荫下找到庇护和支持

2526
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:42,610
他的笑容不会消失

2527
01:37:43,690 --> 01:37:46,850
擦干你的眼泪

2528
01:37:46,920 --> 01:37:49,550
平息你的恐惧

2529
01:37:50,760 --> 01:37:54,860
死亡不会把你和他分开

2530
01:37:54,930 --> 01:37:57,830
他会永存你心中

2531
01:38:10,510 --> 01:38:12,450
事情最近有了好转

2532
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:14,480
我吞下了那块鸡骨头

2533
01:38:14,550 --> 01:38:17,350
朱迪和我被分到同一个班

2534
01:38:17,420 --> 01:38:21,320
而尼克松刚被任命为为美国总统

2535
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


2536
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


2537
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


2538
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


2539
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


2540
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


2541
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
