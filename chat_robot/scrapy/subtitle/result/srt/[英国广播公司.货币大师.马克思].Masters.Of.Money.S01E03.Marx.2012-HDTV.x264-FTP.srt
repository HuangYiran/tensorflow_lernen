2
00:00:03,442 --> 00:00:04,561
多佛
Dover.

3
00:00:05,501 --> 00:00:08,420
全欧洲最威胁的人
The most dangerous man in Europe
is about to arrive

4
00:00:08,427 --> 00:00:09,709
即将在此登陆英伦
on Britain's shores.

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,670
他的福音煽动性十足
His preachings are so incendiary,

6
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,071
他被自己的祖国驱逐出境
he's been forced out
of his native country.

7
00:00:23,751 --> 00:00:27,071
只有自由的英国向他敞开怀抱
Only liberal Britain will tolerate
his presence on her soil.

8
00:00:28,751 --> 00:00:32,390
于是他在伦敦开始了流放生涯
He heads to London to live in exile.

9
00:00:32,391 --> 00:00:34,991
那年是1849年
The year is 1849.

10
00:00:40,071 --> 00:00:43,550
时至今日 他的著作仍具威胁性
But today, that man's writings
are still dangerous.

11
00:00:43,551 --> 00:00:47,750
它是如此激进  如此具革命性
They're so radical,
so revolutionary,

12
00:00:47,751 --> 00:00:51,351
世界仍被其一分为二
they continue to divide the world.

13
00:00:52,031 --> 00:00:54,470
自他书写这个世界算起
It's been more than 150 years

14
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,550
已过去150年了
since he started writing
about the world.

15
00:00:56,551 --> 00:00:57,671
但或许你不曾想到
But you know what?

16
00:00:57,672 --> 00:01:00,948
若要审视全球的经济危机
If you're looking for an explanation
of the global economic crisis,

17
00:01:00,948 --> 00:01:03,870
马克思是绝佳的出发点
he's a surprisingly good place
to start.

18
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:11,989
（他的追随者）把世界搞得一塌糊涂
你会想
With everything going so wrong,
you have to wonder,

19
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:14,711
卡尔・马克思的那套还能对到哪里去呢
is Karl Marx turning out
to be right?

20
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:19,349
大多数人知道马克思是共产主义的创始人
Most people know Marx
as the father of communism.

21
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:23,829
也许 对马克思对资本主义的绝大多数论述
You might be surprised to hear
that most of what he wrote

22
00:01:23,829 --> 00:01:25,070
你会感到惊讶
was about capitalism.

23
00:01:25,072 --> 00:01:28,890
但如今 全球商业核心圈都在认真思考
And today his ideas about that
are being taken seriously

24
00:01:28,891 --> 00:01:31,611
他关于资本主义的观点
right at the heart
of global business.

25
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,948
他的理论正中要害
His analysis was pretty
on the button,

26
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,509
对我们目力所及的
and explains a lot, I think,

27
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:39,668
经济生活
about some of the things
that we see going on

28
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:40,989
马克思的理论很有意义
around in our economy today.

29
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:47,388
马克思对资本主义最大的批判是说
资本主义本质上就是不公平的
For Marx, the best argument against
capitalism was that it was
inherently unfair.

30
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:52,229
今天 他的观点
比以往任何时候更具共鸣
His ideas on inequality
have more resonance than ever today.

31
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,668
马克思就是要
What Marx did do

32
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:57,909
唤起我们的紧迫感
is to install this sense of urgency.

33
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:02,311
世界不能再这样继续下去了
Things cannot go on for ever
the way they are.

34
00:02:04,468 --> 00:02:08,909
本系列 我将引领您回顾
以下三位杰出人物的
In this series, I'll tell you about
the lives and revolutionary thinking

35
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,388
生平及其革命性思想
of three extraordinary men...

36
00:02:11,391 --> 00:02:13,388
约翰・梅纳德・凯恩斯
John Maynard Keynes,

37
00:02:13,391 --> 00:02:15,388
弗里德里希・哈耶克 
Friedrich Hayek,

38
00:02:15,391 --> 00:02:17,309
和卡尔・马克思
and Karl Marx.

39
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:21,228
他们都身处激变的时代
Their worlds were changing
as never before.

40
00:02:21,229 --> 00:02:24,068
他们都发现货币驱驰着国家
They saw that the fate of nations
would hang on the power of money

41
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,668
对于如何控制货币
and they had radically
different ideas

42
00:02:26,669 --> 00:02:29,149
给出了各不相同的主张
about how to control it.

43
00:02:30,669 --> 00:02:32,910
今天 赌注不可能再高了
Today, the stakes could
hardly be higher.

44
00:02:35,391 --> 00:02:38,508
三位大师的思想流传至今
All three of these men were giants
whose ideas live on.

45
00:02:38,509 --> 00:02:42,909
但此刻 人们记住的是
But they speak to us right now
because they, more than anyone,

46
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:46,108
正是他们认识到货币是一把双刃剑
recognised the double-edged
power of money...

47
00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:49,388
市场在变革人们生活方式的同时
how markets could transform
all of our lives,

48
00:02:49,391 --> 00:02:51,589
也使我们陷于混乱
but also plunge us into chaos.

49
00:02:51,591 --> 00:02:55,429
凯恩斯和哈耶克 
就政府是否应该对――资本主义
Keynes and Hayek argued about
whether government

50
00:02:55,429 --> 00:02:59,909
――这一人类的本性
进行管制有所争辩
should try to tame this force
of human nature, capitalism.

51
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:04,429
卡尔・马克思则提出最为激进的方案
――消灭资本主义
Karl Marx had the most radical
advice of all - get rid of it.

52
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:13,429
货币大师   马克思

53
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:29,591
1989年  马克思名誉扫地
In 1989, Karl Marx's reputation
lay in ruins.

54
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:43,229
一片荒芜
What a mess!

55
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:49,189
对我们大多数人来说 柏林墙的倒下
For most of us, the fall
of the Berlin Wall

56
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:51,229
意味着马克思主义的终结
meant the end of Marx.

57
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:55,149
数百万人逃离警察国家
Millions rejected the horrors

58
00:03:55,149 --> 00:03:59,869
不再有暴力镇压的恐怖
of a violent and repressive
police state.

59
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,668
由于曾被这些共产主义国家奉为圭臬
And because the Communist countries
claimed Marx as their inspiration,

60
00:04:07,669 --> 00:04:10,350
人们对马克思主义也嗤之以鼻
his ideas were cast aside, as well.

61
00:04:13,871 --> 00:04:15,949
柏林墙倒塌之际
When this wall came down, I was just

62
00:04:15,951 --> 00:04:18,110
我正在大学学经济
studying economics at university.

63
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:19,910
那时 我们认为
Back then we knew,

64
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,309
至少我们自认为
or we thought we knew,

65
00:04:21,311 --> 00:04:24,389
了解马克思及其共产主义的两个方面
two things about Marxism, Communism.

66
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:28,570
一是与其声称的相反  它没有给予工人以自由
One was it hadn't delivered freedom
for the workers. Quite the opposite.

67
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:31,470
第二条  对一个经济学家来说更糟
And the other, just as bad
if you're an economist,

68
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,670
那就是它没有带来繁荣
was it hadn't delivered prosperity.

69
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:37,871
共产主义的经济路数行不通
The Communist approach
to the economy just hadn't worked.

70
00:04:40,391 --> 00:04:42,910
当西方的自由市场制度兴盛一时之际
While the free market West
took great strides,

71
00:04:42,911 --> 00:04:48,010
共产主义的计划经济被弃之如敝屣
the Communist planned economies
had been left behind.

72
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:52,271
马克思作为经济学家的名声狼藉
Marx's reputation as an economist
was in shreds.

73
00:04:57,071 --> 00:04:59,869
然而过去几年世道骤变
In the last few years,
something strange has happened.

74
00:04:59,871 --> 00:05:02,230
似乎全球的金融危机
It's like the global
financial crisis

75
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,749
使马克思主义又死灰复燃
has brought Karl Marx
back from the dead.

76
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:07,590
虽然我们仍不接受他的共产主义
And we still don't care what he said
about Communism,

77
00:05:07,591 --> 00:05:11,470
但人们开始回想起他对资本主义的批判
but people are going back to his
damming assessment of capitalism,

78
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:15,710
不禁怀疑他所说的――
资本主义其根深蒂固的顽疾
all its deep seated flaws,
with a nagging doubt.

79
00:05:15,711 --> 00:05:18,350
今天是否真的发作了
Is it all now coming true?

80
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:23,670
世道昌明 没人会想起马克思
When times were good,
Marx was nowhere.

81
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,389
但如今 西方深陷经济危机
But now the western economies
are in crisis

82
00:05:26,391 --> 00:05:28,309
他的理论又引起
he's attracting new interest

83
00:05:28,311 --> 00:05:31,591
权威经济学家的关注
right at the heart
of the economic establishment.

84
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:35,350
国际货币基金组织的前首席经济学家：
From a former IMF chief economist...

85
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:39,829
从很多方面来说 马克思是对的
Marx is right
on a number of dimensions.

86
00:05:39,831 --> 00:05:42,910
收入不均
He certainly is right

87
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:47,550
导致贫富阶层关系紧张  这一点没错
that income inequality can be a
source of tremendous tension.

88
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:51,309
预见到2008年经济危机的人：
To the man who saw
the 2008 crisis coming.

89
00:05:51,311 --> 00:05:55,030
他认识到 资本主义
He had understood
that there are situations

90
00:05:55,031 --> 00:05:57,550
以及全球经济一体化
in which capitalism
and globalisation

91
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:01,230
会引发经济危机
can lead to economic crisis.

92
00:06:02,391 --> 00:06:06,030
世界知名银行的经济学家：
And an economist at one of the
world's leading banks.

93
00:06:06,031 --> 00:06:08,949
要说服切尔西或切姆斯福德的人 
It's quite hard to convince people
who live in Chelsea or Chelmsford

94
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,311
马克思主义跟他们很相关 这很难
that this is of great relevance
to them, but actually,

95
00:06:11,312 --> 00:06:12,910
但现在值得一试
it's worth a bash.

96
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:21,790
切尔西和切姆斯福德的居民认为马克思
不过就是共产主义 但如今他们会惊讶的
Anyone in Chelsea or Chelmsford
who thinks Marx is only about
communism, is in for a shock.

97
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:25,951
马克思批判的资本主义如今正在此地上演
It's what he said about capitalism
that rings so true today.

98
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:35,110
马克思的关键洞见是
他看到资本主义本质上是不稳固的
Marx's key insight was that
capitalism was inherently unstable.

99
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:37,670
他说 经济危机会一直伴随我们
He said we'd lurch
from crisis to crisis

100
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:40,910
社会的不公将日益加大
and society would become
increasingly unequal.

101
00:06:43,511 --> 00:06:47,430
马克思将世界分为资本家和工人两个阶级
Marx divided the world
into bosses and workers.

102
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:51,309
他认为 他们的争议难以调和
For him, they would always be
at odds

103
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:54,790
并将导致危机
and that battle
was a recipe for crises.

104
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:01,350
为了攫取利益 资本家榨取工人
To make profit, bosses squeeze
what they pay workers.

105
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:05,309
当工人们没有足够的钱
购买资本家售予他们的物品时
The crisis comes when workers
then don't have enough money

106
00:07:05,311 --> 00:07:08,790
危机就爆发了
to buy what bosses
are trying to sell them.

107
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:12,150
二战后的几十年间
这套理论看似站不住脚
And for decades after World War II,
that looked completely wrong.

108
00:07:12,151 --> 00:07:14,150
我们经济增长稳定
We had years of stable growth,

109
00:07:14,151 --> 00:07:18,790
工人们在经济增长的蛋糕中
分享到越来越多的份额
and the workers were taking a
larger and larger share of the pie.

110
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,631
但现在不是了
But not anymore.

111
00:07:25,031 --> 00:07:28,550
马克思解释了为什么会发生经济危机
他注意到 
Marx would explain this crisis
in terms of the fact

112
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:31,829
普通人挣的钱不够花
that ordinary people haven't got
enough money to spend.

113
00:07:31,831 --> 00:07:33,751
为什么没钱花
Why haven't they got enough
money to spend?

114
00:07:33,752 --> 00:07:36,590
因为钱被重新分配了
Because there's been a big
redistribution,

115
00:07:36,591 --> 00:07:38,350
过去几十年来都是这样
over the last few decades,

116
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:42,271
钱从普通人手里转移到资本家 富人手里
away from ordinary people
towards capital, towards wealth.

117
00:07:46,311 --> 00:07:49,150
马克思认为 这一切不会改变
And for Marx,
there's no turning back.

118
00:07:49,151 --> 00:07:53,829
他认为人类历史的发展犹如
牛顿运动定律那般
He thought there were laws of motion
running through human history.

119
00:07:53,831 --> 00:07:57,030
资本主义的危机会越来越严重
Capitalism would produce
bigger and bigger crises

120
00:07:57,031 --> 00:07:59,430
最终它将灭亡
and then it would collapse.

121
00:08:02,311 --> 00:08:06,150
他认为迫使资本主义灭亡的这股力量
And he believed that the force
driving us to this final collapse

122
00:08:06,151 --> 00:08:09,550
跟推动这个世界的动力是一样的
was the same one that built our
world in the first place...

123
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,350
那就是金钱的力量
the power of money.

124
00:08:14,031 --> 00:08:16,710
对于危机 马克思有一个很简单的方程式
Marx had a very simple formulation
about crises,

125
00:08:16,711 --> 00:08:22,910
显示资本主义的根本缺陷
which is that they are manifestations
of the fundamental flaws,

126
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:26,030
或者如他所说的资本主义难以调和的矛盾
or contradictions,
as he called them, of capitalism.

127
00:08:26,031 --> 00:08:30,390
马克思的危机解决方案
How would Marx have suggested
solving the crisis is,

128
00:08:30,391 --> 00:08:33,670
当然就是消除资本主义
of course, by abolishing capitalism.

129
00:08:33,671 --> 00:08:38,551
资本主义是否超过自己的大限了呢
Is capitalism living on borrowed time?

130
00:08:42,831 --> 00:08:48,310
有时 这也没什么难理解的
Sometimes it doesn't feel
that farfetched.

131
00:08:49,099 --> 00:08:52,790
来到这儿 让人的思绪萦绕于马克思
Here's why I've been thinking
more about Marx...

132
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:57,550
因为过去几年的经济衰退很不寻常
it's cos the last few years hasn't
felt like an ordinary recession.

133
00:08:57,551 --> 00:09:00,550
它不是西方某个经济体
It hasn't felt like a crisis
for one economy

134
00:09:00,551 --> 00:09:02,391
或是一组经济体遭受危机
or for a group of economies
in the West.

135
00:09:02,392 --> 00:09:06,350
而是整个体系 即所谓的资本主义制度
At times it really has felt like
a crisis for the system,

136
00:09:06,351 --> 00:09:08,470
遭受危机
for capitalism as we know it.

137
00:09:08,471 --> 00:09:11,030
所以 你得着眼一个更宽泛的解释
You want a bigger explanation.

138
00:09:11,031 --> 00:09:13,710
从这个意义上讲  没人比马克思
And no-one's ever had
a bigger explanation

139
00:09:13,711 --> 00:09:16,711
给出的解释更深刻了
for everything that's happened
than Karl Marx.

140
00:09:25,511 --> 00:09:27,710
对资本主义最严厉的批判家
Capitalism's most implacable critic

141
00:09:27,711 --> 00:09:31,870
诞生在风景如画的小镇特里尔
was born in the picture-postcard
town of Trier,

142
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:33,431
现位于德国西南部
in what is now southwest Germany.

143
00:09:38,591 --> 00:09:43,390
如今 他的出生地为本地经济贡献良多
Today, his birthplace makes its own
contribution to the local economy...

144
00:09:43,391 --> 00:09:46,711
这儿吸引了大量游客
it's a big draw for tourists.

145
00:09:48,511 --> 00:09:52,390
有很多游客 来自世界各地
But do you still have a lot of
people coming here, tourists,

146
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:53,870
慕名而来吧
from around the world?

147
00:09:53,871 --> 00:09:56,550
是的 每年差不多有4000名游客
Yes, we have more than 40,000
tourists a year

148
00:09:56,551 --> 00:10:00,950
其中四分之一来自中国
and 25% came from China.

149
00:10:00,951 --> 00:10:04,150
四分之一来自中国  是的  
So, a quarter of them come from
China... Yes, yeah.

150
00:10:04,151 --> 00:10:05,950
来参观马克思的出生地  是的
To see Marx' birthplace. Yeah.

151
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:08,030
他们买些什么纪念品吗 他们喜欢什么
And what do they buy,
what do they like?

152
00:10:08,031 --> 00:10:10,350
他们喜欢红巧克力
They like the red chocolate.

153
00:10:10,351 --> 00:10:11,469
卡尔・马克思巧克力
The Karl Marx chocolate.

154
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,671
也许 我也应该带上些
Maybe I should get some of that,
as well, actually.

155
00:10:13,672 --> 00:10:14,710
还有酒
And the wine.

156
00:10:14,711 --> 00:10:20,790
马克思的父亲 海因里希・马克思
在特雷尔附近有一座葡萄园
Well, Marx's father, Heinrich Marx,
he had a vineyard nearby Trier.

157
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:24,390
您认为 马克思不会介意
你们售卖这些东西吧
And you don't think that Karl Marx
would mind you selling all this stuff?

158
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:25,951
开这个店 有点资本主义啊
A bit capitalist, having this shop.

159
00:10:25,952 --> 00:10:31,951
也许他会喜欢的吧  他是个很有幽默感的人
Perhaps he'd enjoy it
because he had a good humour too.

160
00:10:37,031 --> 00:10:39,870
这个把我们的世界纳于其宏大理论的人
The man with the big theory
about our world

161
00:10:39,871 --> 00:10:42,311
一开始就显露出凌云之志
had big dreams right from the start.

162
00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:44,751
17岁时
When he was 17,

163
00:10:44,752 --> 00:10:48,910
马克思要写一个未来的职业计划
Marx had to write an essay about
picking the right career.

164
00:10:48,911 --> 00:10:53,350
他说此生要为全人类服务
He said the best position in life
was to serve all of mankind,

165
00:10:53,351 --> 00:10:56,850
“你的事业会获得永生
so your deed would live on
perpetually at work

166
00:10:56,851 --> 00:11:01,050
面对你的骨灰 高尚的人将洒下热泪”
and over your ashes would be shed
the hot tears of noble people.

167
00:11:01,151 --> 00:11:05,030
我怀疑 这个了不起的年轻人
I wonder, would that young man,
that rather grand young man,
 
167
00:11:09,631 --> 00:11:13,910
是否对自己的故居被建成博物馆而惊讶呢
be surprised to hear that his first
home had been turned into a museum?

168
00:11:09,311 --> 00:11:10,351
也许不会吧
Probably not.

169
00:11:14,911 --> 00:11:18,030
虽说抱负远大 但马克思可不是个好学生
But for all his ambitions,
Marx was hardly a model student.

170
00:11:18,031 --> 00:11:20,830
在柏林上大学时
When he was at university in Berlin

171
00:11:20,831 --> 00:11:24,311
他即获得激进分子的名号
he earned a reputation
as a radical thinker.

172
00:11:25,871 --> 00:11:31,030
马克思可以说是一个
Marx comes across as a young man,
as this, sort of,

173
00:11:31,031 --> 00:11:35,310
精力充沛 有血性的危险人物
energetic, fiery, hairy figure.

174
00:11:35,311 --> 00:11:37,910
他被称为是“沼泽里的野猪”
He was known as the
Wild Boar of the Moor,

175
00:11:37,911 --> 00:11:41,510
这被用来形容他早年复杂的性格
which, sort of, points to his,
sort of, Levantine complex.

176
00:11:41,511 --> 00:11:44,070
他主意超多 超爱争辩
He was full of ideas.
He was full of debate.

177
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:48,750
他爱推杯换盏 之后进行思辨的争论
He liked big drinking sessions
and then deep philosophical debate

178
00:11:48,751 --> 00:11:53,431
话题是 基督的本质啦
德国的浪漫主义 以及政治等
about the nature of Christ
and German Romanticism and politics.

179
00:11:57,431 --> 00:11:59,390
24岁时
By the time he was 24,

180
00:11:59,391 --> 00:12:02,030
我们的马克思博士颇有文艺复兴的范儿
Dr Marx was a bit
of a renaissance man.

181
00:12:02,031 --> 00:12:06,350
可以说是法律 哲学方面的专家
He was an expert in law,
philosophy, you name it.

182
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:11,351
事实上 当时他不太懂的就是经济
In fact, the only thing he didn't
know much about was economics.

183
00:12:15,831 --> 00:12:19,830
但1842年之后 一切都变了
That all changed in 1842.

184
00:12:19,831 --> 00:12:23,070
那时 马克思是一家报社的编辑
Marx, by now working as a journalist,

185
00:12:23,071 --> 00:12:25,031
他听闻了一个有关林地的争论
heard about a controversy in this wood

186
00:12:25,032 --> 00:12:27,590
这场争论帮助马克思
that would help shape his understanding

187
00:12:27,591 --> 00:12:29,071
定型了其世界观
of how the world works.

188
00:12:34,111 --> 00:12:38,910
农民从这片林子中捡拾柴火
Peasants taking sticks from the
forest floor to use as firewood

189
00:12:38,911 --> 00:12:40,430
但他们却被人控告犯有偷盗罪
were being prosecuted for theft.

190
00:12:40,431 --> 00:12:42,510
几世纪来 这片林地一成未变
Wood had been gathered here
for centuries

191
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:45,551
但突然 地主说这片地归他们了
but now the landowners had declared
it belonged to them.

192
00:12:48,071 --> 00:12:53,311
原本自由拾取的柴火现在成了私有财产
What had been freely shared
was now private property.

193
00:12:54,671 --> 00:12:57,230
可以说 正是从这件事开始
You could say
that thinking about this question

194
00:12:57,231 --> 00:12:58,870
让马克思变身为一个经济学家
turned Marx into an economist,

195
00:12:58,871 --> 00:13:00,870
但这只是个起点
but that wouldn't really capture it.

196
00:13:00,871 --> 00:13:02,390
马克思开始思考经济问题
He came to think that economics,

197
00:13:02,391 --> 00:13:05,030
他认为人与人之间的经济关系
the nature of economic relationships
between people,

198
00:13:05,031 --> 00:13:08,791
是所有关系中最核心的
were at the heart
of absolutely everything.

199
00:13:10,151 --> 00:13:14,190
马克思主义的理论基础是唯物主义
The foundations of Marx's thinking
was materialism,

200
00:13:14,191 --> 00:13:18,070
即抽象掉宗教 意识形态 政治因素
that when you cut away religion,
ideology, politics,

201
00:13:18,071 --> 00:13:20,950
最后只剩人与人之间的
at its root were the material relations

202
00:13:20,951 --> 00:13:23,310
物质关系――衣食住行等
between man - the need for food,

203
00:13:23,311 --> 00:13:26,190
基本的生活需求
the need to have a roof over your head.

204
00:13:26,191 --> 00:13:30,310
这便是人际互动中的终极驱动力
This is what ultimately drives
so much of human interaction.

205
00:13:30,311 --> 00:13:35,230
马克思独特的地方在于 
经济在他看来
What was unique in Marx,
he didn't see economy

206
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:38,310
不仅仅是一个特殊领域
just as a special sphere.

207
00:13:38,311 --> 00:13:42,510
他把它视作整个社会关系中
He saw economy as
the structuring principle

208
00:13:42,511 --> 00:13:45,190
最根本的一项
of the entire social totality.

209
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:49,590
马克思认为 一切都源自私有财产
For Marx, it all begins
with private property,

210
00:13:49,591 --> 00:13:52,310
正是它赤裸裸地把世界区分为...
which divides the world starkly...

211
00:13:52,311 --> 00:13:53,671
有产者
there are those that have it,

212
00:13:53,672 --> 00:13:55,631
跟无产者
and those that don't.

213
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,510
拿这些木头来说
Take this wood.

214
00:13:59,511 --> 00:14:02,310
它成为私有财产前 我可以随心所欲地处置
Before it became private property,
I could do what I liked with it.

215
00:14:02,311 --> 00:14:05,750
拿它当柴火给房子供暖或者做把椅子
I could heat my house with it,
I could make a chair

216
00:14:05,751 --> 00:14:07,670
或者拿它去换食物
and exchange it for food.

217
00:14:07,671 --> 00:14:11,150
但它若成为某人的私有财产
整个关系就变了
But if it belongs to someone else,
the whole relationship changes.

218
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:14,670
按照马克思的说法 我就成了无产者
Now Marx would say I've become
a member of the proletariat,

219
00:14:14,671 --> 00:14:17,070
必须为这片林地的主人
now I have to work
for the owner of the wood,

220
00:14:17,071 --> 00:14:19,790
也就是资产阶级工作 以换取工资
the capitalist, for a wage.

221
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:22,030
然后他才会把我的劳动产品卖给我
Then he can sell what I've made

222
00:14:22,031 --> 00:14:23,590
而价格却比我的工资还高
for more than he paid me.

223
00:14:23,591 --> 00:14:25,030
瞧 都发生了什么
Look what's happened,

224
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:29,310
我生活中的某些部分 财产上发生了转移
something that was part of my life
is now a financial transaction.

225
00:14:29,311 --> 00:14:31,470
资本家赚取了利润
And the capitalists made profit.

226
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:34,070
这些利润 他可以拿去买更多木头 开工厂
He can use that to buy more wood,
build factories,

227
00:14:34,071 --> 00:14:35,670
以赚取更多利润
make more profit.

228
00:14:35,671 --> 00:14:40,551
这样周而复始 利润成为全部的动力
And so it goes on. Profit
is now the heart of everything.

229
00:14:45,031 --> 00:14:48,590
这就是马克思主义的资本主义理论
So, there you have it -
the Marxian view of capitalism,

230
00:14:48,591 --> 00:14:50,590
或是其精髓吧
or the gist of it, anyway.

231
00:14:50,591 --> 00:14:52,670
如果你想了解更多 那就得去啃
If you want more,
you'll have to wade through

232
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,391
马克思的皇皇巨著了
hundreds of pages of Marx, yourself.

233
00:14:54,392 --> 00:14:59,310
我们所关心的是资本主义的源动力
The key point for us is that
that driving force of capitalism,

234
00:14:59,311 --> 00:15:01,550
即源源不断地攫取利润
the need to earn more
and more profit,

235
00:15:01,551 --> 00:15:05,311
马克思认为 这也将引发不断的危机
well, Marx thought that was also
a recipe for constant crises.

236
00:15:09,191 --> 00:15:11,030
马克思会说
So, Marx would say

237
00:15:10,931 --> 00:15:13,810
追溯现在这场经济危机
you could trace the roots
of the crisis we're in today

238
00:15:13,911 --> 00:15:17,350
其根源都是资本主义的本质
right to the very heart of capitalism,

239
00:15:17,351 --> 00:15:19,791
即追求利润
to its need to generate profit.

240
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:37,310
马克思在特雷尔就预见到
这个变动不居的世界
What Marx was seeing in Trier
was a world in flux.

241
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,710
封建主义正步出历史舞台
Feudalism was on the way out...

242
00:15:39,711 --> 00:15:42,910
一种全新的生产方式来临
an entirely new way of doing things
had arrived.

243
00:15:42,911 --> 00:15:46,670
如今 我们对资本主义了如指掌
Now, we know what capitalism's
really made of,

244
00:15:46,671 --> 00:15:48,390
今天 金钱的力量
and the power of money today

245
00:15:48,391 --> 00:15:52,110
远比把几个农民送进监狱更强大
means a lot more than just
throwing a few peasants in jail.

246
00:15:52,111 --> 00:15:54,390
交易所里的几号人
A bunch of guys on a trading floor

247
00:15:54,391 --> 00:15:57,230
可以把世界经济玩个底朝天
can turn the entire economy
upside down.

248
00:15:57,231 --> 00:16:02,350
世界范围内 我们的生活都依赖于市场
Around the world, all of our lives
depend on markets,

249
00:16:02,351 --> 00:16:04,790
依赖于资本主义制度下的物流
on capitalism being able to deliver.

250
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:09,350
如果马克思是对的 
资本主义有其天生的缺陷
If Marx is right,
if it's fundamentally flawed,

251
00:16:09,351 --> 00:16:11,991
那问题就严重了
well, that's a really big problem.

252
00:16:17,431 --> 00:16:20,430
现代经济是个错综复杂的混合体
We might see a complex, modern economy,

253
00:16:20,431 --> 00:16:22,830
我们谁也无法置身其外
which all of us have a stake in.

254
00:16:22,831 --> 00:16:26,510
马克思主义者会说  老的那套依旧适用 
But Marxists would say
the same old rules still apply.

255
00:16:26,511 --> 00:16:30,711
他们认为 有产者仍掌控一切
For them, who owns what
still means everything.

256
00:16:32,431 --> 00:16:34,830
工人仍辛苦劳碌
They see workers still slaving away

257
00:16:34,831 --> 00:16:37,910
资产阶级或是布尔乔亚们
and capitalists, or bourgeoisie,

258
00:16:37,911 --> 00:16:40,150
仍在剥削工人
still exploiting them,

259
00:16:40,151 --> 00:16:43,231
以攫取更多利润
always striving to make more profit.

260
00:16:48,431 --> 00:16:52,110
马克思认为 任何不追求利益最大化的资本家
In Marx's world, any capitalist
that doesn't seek maximum profit

261
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:54,151
将很快被别人取代
is soon replaced by one who does.

262
00:16:57,431 --> 00:17:01,068
所以 整个体系的过程完全可以预见
So, the system follows a completely
predictable course,

263
00:17:01,069 --> 00:17:03,667
那就是趋向崩溃
he would say,to its own destruction.

264
00:17:03,667 --> 00:17:07,789
对此 很多人并不接受
It's not an idea
that many people accept.

265
00:17:07,789 --> 00:17:10,667
他大错特错
He was completely wrong,

266
00:17:10,667 --> 00:17:13,667
说什么资本主义只是一个过渡阶段
including the idea that capitalism
was merely a phase,

267
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:18,029
自身就包含了毁灭的种子
and contained within it the seeds of
its own destruction.

268
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,789
完全不是那回事
That's not the case.

269
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:22,907
任何事物 放眼足够长的时间都会灭亡
Well, everything is bound to
collapse if you wait long enough.

270
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:25,669
地球也逃不脱
I mean, the earth's going to,you know,

271
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:27,790
某天被太阳吞没的命运
sucked into the sun, some day.

272
00:17:29,251 --> 00:17:32,369
资本主义的完全灭亡 这听起来难以置信
You'd be forgiven for thinking
the total collapse of capitalism

273
00:17:32,371 --> 00:17:33,891
但却情有可原
sounds a little implausible.

274
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:38,909
追求利润怎么就是灾难呢
How could seeking profit
be so disastrous,

275
00:17:38,909 --> 00:17:41,949
它不是也成就了诸多伟业吗
when it's done such amazing things?

276
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:49,029
看看资本主义制度下我们的口福
Just look at how
we eat under capitalism.

277
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:53,388
我们得享来自世界各地的水果
We get fresh fruit flown in
from all over the world.

278
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:57,468
光早餐就有700种谷类食品可供选择
We can choose from 700 types
of breakfast cereal.

279
00:17:57,469 --> 00:18:00,429
应有尽有 而且绝对安全
We have enough of it
and it's all safe to eat.

280
00:18:03,429 --> 00:18:05,669
充足的物资供应 令人难以置信
There's incredible plenty

281
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:09,388
而其依赖的技术并不局限于本国
and the technology it depends
on didn't come from the state.

282
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:12,630
这些都是资本家竞相逐利的结果
It's what happens when you let
capitalists compete for profit.

283
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,388
他们这么做不是为我们
They didn't do it for our benefit.

284
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:18,669
而是为自己致富
They did it because it made them rich.

285
00:18:20,429 --> 00:18:22,549
所以 乍听起来 
So, at first glance, Marx's idea

286
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:25,589
马克思说资本主义逐利的本质
会使其灭亡
that capitalism's search for profit
would be its downfall,

287
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,669
完全是无稽之谈
sounds absurd.

288
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:31,029
利润这词听起来有些贬义 
Profit may often sound venal,
it may often sound wrong,

289
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:33,309
但它却有助于进步
but it is what pushes progress ahead.

290
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:36,029
可以说是利润推动了世界的发展
Profit is actually what drives
the world forward

291
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:38,708
这是马克思主义者不能否认的
and that's what Marx
could never quite handle.

292
00:18:38,709 --> 00:18:40,708
逐利就是世界的本质
The profit motive is essential.

293
00:18:40,709 --> 00:18:42,669
什么是趋利避害
I mean, after all,
what is the profit motive?

294
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:47,148
就是人们为了自己的利益奔忙
It's just a way of achieving
a better society

295
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:51,150
从而也营造更美好的社会
by people wanting to better
their own individual lot.

296
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:57,669
正是利益的驱动
When you think of how fundamentally
the profit motive

297
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:59,829
塑造并繁荣了我们的世界
has shaped and enriched our world,

298
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:02,351
怪不得马克思那套不受欢迎了
it's no wonder Marx
fell out of favour.

299
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:07,549
但据此完全摒弃马克思也不对
But you shouldn't dismiss
Dr Marx quite yet.

300
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:11,748
马克思的确过多关注阶级剥削 穷困 
I mean, it's true he talked a lot
about class exploitation, misery,

301
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:14,909
混乱 但他并没有
把资本主义贬得一无是处
chaos, but he didn't think
capitalism was all bad.

302
00:19:14,909 --> 00:19:16,070
远不是这样
Far from it.

303
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:24,669
伦敦Soho区的这间鸡尾酒吧
隐藏着一段革命史
This cocktail bar in London's Soho
hides a revolutionary past.

304
00:19:26,189 --> 00:19:28,388
它过去是红狮酒吧
It used to be the Red Lion pub,

305
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:32,468
1847年 共产主义者曾在此秘密聚会
site of a clandestine
meeting of communists in 1847

306
00:19:32,469 --> 00:19:35,429
那时 共产国际正风起云涌
that would echo down the ages.

307
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:42,510
正是这次会议 马克思和他的挚友
It was at that meeting
that they commissioned Karl Marx,

308
00:19:42,511 --> 00:19:45,069
弗里德里希・恩格斯被委任
and his side kick Friedrich Engels,
to write

309
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:48,148
为有史以来最具煽动性的宣传册执笔
one of the most incendiary pamphlets
of all time,

310
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:49,869
《共产党宣言》
the Communist Manifesto.

311
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:58,170
有些你们或许知道
Some of this you probably know.

312
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:01,909
著名的开场白――
“一个幽灵在欧洲游荡”。
The famous opening line -
"A spectre is haunting Europe."

313
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:08,188
当然还有最后―― 
无产者在革命中失去的只是锁链。
And of course the end, about the
workers having nothing to lose but their chains.

314
00:20:08,189 --> 00:20:09,909
他们获得的将是整个世界。 
"They have a world to win.

315
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:13,708
以及大写的：全世界无产者联合起来 
"Working men of all countries
UNITE!" in capital letters.

316
00:20:13,709 --> 00:20:17,228
但你或许不知 我找到最有趣的
But what you probably don't know,
what I find most interesting,

317
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:19,509
是在中间
is what's in the middle.

318
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,509
这是我见过的 对资本主义
One of the most perceptive,

319
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:25,708
最有洞察力 最赞赏性的文字
and admiring, bits of writing
about capitalism I've ever read.

320
00:20:25,709 --> 00:20:30,150
实际上 相比于成书之时
现在看来真实性更强
In fact, it reads a lot truer now
than when it was written.

321
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:35,188
我发现  令人惊讶的是
在马克思的诸多作品中
I think what's surprising
about a lot of Marx's writing

322
00:20:35,189 --> 00:20:37,309
即便是有关共产主义的著作中
is that you find, in amongst
the communism,

323
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:42,948
对资本主义都有很多精妙的分析
a lot of good analysis of capitalism
and actually you also find within it

324
00:20:42,949 --> 00:20:45,188
甚至是赞誉
quite a lot of praise
for capitalism.

325
00:20:45,189 --> 00:20:50,029
马克思对资本主义的态度很暧昧
Marx's attitude towards capitalism
is basically ambiguous.

326
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:53,708
一方面 他很真诚
He's, at the same time,
he was honest, here, Marx,

327
00:20:53,709 --> 00:20:55,909
对资本主义极度沉迷
ultra-fascinated.
He was fully aware

328
00:20:55,909 --> 00:20:59,748
他深知 从人类历史看 资本主义
that this is the most productive,
dynamic system

329
00:20:59,751 --> 00:21:01,709
是最有活力和生产力的制度
in the history of humanity,and so on.

330
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:07,509
马克思清楚  逐利的本性
The truth is, Marx did understand
that the drive for profit

331
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:09,709
会获得难以置信的物质增长
would achieve incredible things.

332
00:21:11,429 --> 00:21:15,109
它第一个证明了 
人的活动能够取得什么样的成就
"It has been the first to show
what man's activity can bring about.

333
00:21:15,109 --> 00:21:17,948
它创造了完全不同于
"It's accomplished wonders
far surpassing

334
00:21:17,949 --> 00:21:19,830
埃及金字塔 罗马水道
"Egyptian pyramids, Roman aqueducts

335
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,228
和哥特式教堂的奇迹
"and Gothic cathedrals.

336
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:24,829
它完成了完全不同于
"It has conducted expeditions
that put in the shade

337
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:29,099
民族大迁徙和十字军征讨的远征
"all former exoduses
of nations and crusades."

338
00:21:29,669 --> 00:21:32,549
他预见到了全球化
He did really get
the kind of global aspect.

339
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,588
预见到了
He got the idea

340
00:21:33,589 --> 00:21:35,747
突然间 人们得以从全球不同的地方
that people were suddenly being able
to get things

341
00:21:35,748 --> 00:21:37,109
获取他们想要的东西
from all the way round the world

342
00:21:37,111 --> 00:21:39,148
这是史无前例亦是冲击巨大的
in a completely new way
and the impact of that.

343
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:44,109
不断扩大产品销路的需要
The need of a constantly expanding
market for its products

344
00:21:44,109 --> 00:21:47,909
驱使资产阶级奔走于全球各地
chases the bourgeoisie over
the whole surface of the globe.

345
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:51,109
它必须到处落户 到处开发 
It must nestle everywhere,
settle everywhere,

346
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:53,709
到处建立联系
establish connections everywhere.

347
00:21:55,429 --> 00:21:58,590
这全凭它自己的意志
It creates a world after its own image.

348
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:04,069
但资产阶级有其天生的缺陷
But you know, there's got to be
a downside for the bourgeoisie.

349
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:08,589
现代的资本主义社会恰似一个男巫
Modern bourgeois society
is like the sorcerer

350
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:11,188
他不再能支配
who is no longer able to control the
powers of the netherworld

351
00:22:11,189 --> 00:22:15,029
自己用符咒呼唤出来的魔鬼
whom he has called up by his spells.

352
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:18,948
资本阶级生产的
What the bourgeoisie therefore
produces above all

353
00:22:18,949 --> 00:22:21,029
不过是它自己的掘墓人
is its own gravediggers.

354
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:24,029
资产阶级的灭亡和无产阶级的胜利
Its fall, and the victory
of the proletariat,

355
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:25,669
是同样不可避免的
are equally inevitable.

356
00:22:32,709 --> 00:22:36,829
听起来有点绕  但他的确提出了一个难题
It's stirring stuff,
but it does raise a bit of a puzzle.

357
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:39,909
为什么马克思认为资产阶级 布尔乔亚
How can Marx think the capitalists,
the bourgeoisie,

358
00:22:39,909 --> 00:22:42,948
如此精彩但又注定失败呢
are so brilliant and yet so doomed?

359
00:22:42,949 --> 00:22:46,510
在马克思看来  这都在于他们对待员工的方式
Well, for him, it all came down to
the way they treat their staff.

360
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:58,468
要理解马克思对资本主义危机的分析
To understand Marx's analysis of crises

361
00:22:58,469 --> 00:23:02,388
我们首先得了解他对资本主义的解读
we have to first understand
the capitalism that he knew.

362
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:05,428
19世纪 资产阶级的确创造出
19th century capitalists
might have built wonders

363
00:23:05,429 --> 00:23:07,428
超越了埃及金字塔那样的奇迹
surpassing Egyptian pyramids,

364
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:10,388
但代价是逼迫工人
but they also forced their workers

365
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:14,030
接受难以忍受的工作环境和工资
to endure terrible conditions and pay.

366
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,829
工业革命
The Industrial Revolution

367
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:27,228
及其后难以置信的成就
and all the incredible achievements
that followed

368
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:30,590
这些之所以能实现
离不开煤矿工人的贡献
were made possible by coal miners.

369
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:35,188
这儿再现了维多利亚时期矿井的原貌
This is a replica of what it were
like in Victorian era underground.

370
00:23:35,189 --> 00:23:37,550
你能看到 远处有个人拿着镐和铁锹
The man you can see at far side
he had a pick and shovel,

371
00:23:37,551 --> 00:23:40,549
他在挖煤 直到把煤筐装满
e would work the coal, fill that corf.

372
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:45,428
而他的妻子要把身后的煤拉到装卸点
And his wife had to drag the coal
behind her to a loading point

373
00:23:45,429 --> 00:23:48,228
那大概有三四十米远吧
which, well, could be
up to 30 or 40 metres away.

374
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:51,309
我没料到 竟会是夫妻两人都在这儿工作
I didn't realise that they were
husband and wives that worked here.

375
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,751
哦 是的  都是一家人齐上阵
Oh, yeah, it were all families.

376
00:23:52,751 --> 00:23:55,148
他们还要让一个小男孩或小女孩
They needed a little boy
or a little girl

377
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,909
在门口工作
to work this door as well.

378
00:23:56,909 --> 00:24:00,789
所以 要做这份工作还得生个小孩
But if you took the job you had
to provide a small child, so...

379
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:03,309
是的 他们仅有的照明就是一根蜡烛
Yeah. The only light they had between
them were a candle

380
00:24:03,211 --> 00:24:06,049
由父亲拿着 好看清采煤的工作面 
which their dad kept so he could see
where he was in the coal face,

381
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:07,590
男孩或女孩呢
so the little boy or girl

382
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:12,150
就在黑暗中 孤零零地一天独坐12个小时
was sat on their own, in the dark,
for twelve hours a day.

383
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:17,188
对欧洲工业化时期的恐怖景象
It is difficult to overstate

384
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:19,549
怎么夸大都不为过
the horror of industrialisation
in Europe.

385
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:23,188
以1829年的利物浦为例
In 1829 Liverpool, for example,

386
00:24:23,189 --> 00:24:26,029
平均寿命只有28岁
the life expectancy at birth
was about 28 years.

387
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:29,589
这是自黑死病后最低的数字
And that was the lowest age
since the Black Death.

388
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:33,829
所以 工业革命给人们的生活带来的冲击
So the impact of the Industrial
Revolution on life chances

389
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:36,550
绝对是十分可怕的
was absolutely terrifying.

390
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:42,829
至1849年 马克思因其煽动革命的著作
By 1849, his revolutionary
writings had got Marx

391
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:45,590
被各国驱逐 只有英国接纳了他
banned from everywhere but Britain.

392
00:24:46,949 --> 00:24:51,029
在这里 他观察到金钱的力量
是怎么毁掉人的生活
Here he could observe the power
money had to ruin lives,

393
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:54,310
当然 在适当安全的距离之外
at a suitably safe distance, of course.

394
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,469
过去几分钟
I think in the last few minutes

395
00:24:57,471 --> 00:25:00,669
我与维多利亚时代的苦役生活
有了亲密接触
I've come closer to what
it was actually like,

396
00:25:00,669 --> 00:25:04,669
马克思都未曾做到过
the drudgery of Victorian times,
than Karl Marx ever did.

397
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,949
他可从未下过矿井 而且据我们所知
He never went to a mine
and as far as we can tell

398
00:25:06,951 --> 00:25:10,188
直到他人生末期他才去过一家工厂
he only went to a factory once
towards the end of his life.

399
00:25:10,189 --> 00:25:13,029
不过 这没能阻止马克思生动地呈现
But it didn't stop him
writing vividly

400
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:16,949
英国黑暗 罪恶 恐怖的矿井
about the horrors of Britain's dark,
satanic mills.

401
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:23,309
正是维多利亚时期工人们恶劣的工作环境
The horrors of Victorian
working conditions

402
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:25,630
造就了马克思的经济理论
clearly shaped Marx's economics.

403
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:33,069
在那个年代 工人的工资越低
意味着老板们的利润越高
In his time, minimum pay for proles
meant maximum profits for bosses,

404
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:36,709
谁要是工资开得高  等待他们的是破产
and any bosses who did choose
to pay more usually went bust.

405
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:41,309
他认为工资会越压越低
He thought there'd always be
downward pressure on wages

406
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:43,829
低到最后的工资
and that wages would come down to
the minimum

407
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,109
只能勉强能维持生计
that enabled bare survival.

408
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:47,909
工资不能再低了 否则工人没法活了
They couldn't go lower than that,
otherwise the workers would die.

409
00:25:47,909 --> 00:25:50,348
但马克思认为工资会朝那个最低点逼近
But he thought they'd be
depressed down to that minimum.

410
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:52,310
但事实却恰恰相反
The reality, of course,
has been the opposite.

411
00:25:52,311 --> 00:25:55,909
工资一直在增长
It has been a continual advancement
in wages, year in year out,

412
00:25:55,909 --> 00:25:57,510
数十年都是那样
decade in decade in, decade out.

413
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:03,388
马克思错了
Marx was wrong.

414
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:05,228
他认为 形势会越来越糟
He thought it would all get so bad

415
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,590
工人最终会起来造反
the workers would overthrow the system.

416
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:11,428
然而 即便在他写作的年代
Yet even as he was writing,

417
00:26:11,429 --> 00:26:15,388
已经有改革者开始着手去除
这套雇佣关系中最不利的方面
reformers were beginning to get rid
of the worst employment practices.

418
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:18,909
资本主义趋向温和  而非恶劣
Capitalism got kinder, not nastier.

419
00:26:18,909 --> 00:26:22,069
但马克思的洞见  资本家追逐利润
But the idea that the competing
interests of bosses

420
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:26,790
工人们爆发危机  
这些反倒适用于今天的情况了
and workers would cause crises,
well, that does seem relevant today.

421
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,590
马克思的理论很深奥
That's a very sophisticated argument,

422
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:39,388
让我用玩偶来解释一下吧
so, I'm going to need children's
toys to explain it.

423
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,708
首先 我要强调的是
But let me say, right at the start,

424
00:26:41,709 --> 00:26:46,069
这些玩偶都不准备发起什么暴力革命
none of these toys endorse
any kind of violent revolution.

425
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:50,468
好 这个玩偶好比是矿主
Now here's a mine owner -
capitalist.

426
00:26:50,469 --> 00:26:54,109
这是矿工 哦帽子掉了
Miners, with or without hat.

427
00:26:54,109 --> 00:26:59,669
假设本来矿工不多
Now, imagine that there aren't very
many miners around.

428
00:26:59,669 --> 00:27:04,109
矿主为了和其他资本家竞争工人
Then the mine owner has to compete
with the other capitalists

429
00:27:04,109 --> 00:27:10,428
他将不得不开出较高的工资给工人
for workers, probably ends up having
to pay them more than he'd like to.

430
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:13,309
问题是 人工上去了
Trouble is, those higher costs

431
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:14,948
会削减利润
cut into profits.

432
00:27:14,949 --> 00:27:17,708
如果整个经济体都是这种情况
Now if that's happening across
the economy,

433
00:27:17,709 --> 00:27:20,029
利润率会逐渐下降
you've got a declining rate
of profit

434
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:22,948
很多资本家会破产
and a lot of capitalists
going out of business.

435
00:27:22,949 --> 00:27:24,748
这就是危机了
You get a crisis.

436
00:27:24,751 --> 00:27:27,148
无数工人将失业
You get countless workers
losing their jobs,

437
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:32,309
他们艰难度日 直到工资下降
having a terrible time,
until finally wages fall far enough,

438
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:35,150
资本家再次雇佣他们
the capitalists can go back
to exploiting them again.

439
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:40,188
所以 高工资对经济也不好
So, high labour
costs are bad for business.

440
00:27:40,189 --> 00:27:44,490
但马克思认为
资本主义的崩溃之所以不可避免
But what makes the collapse
of capitalism inevitable for Marx

441
00:27:44,491 --> 00:27:48,289
是因为哪怕资本家获得了其所需的资源  
is that the bosses are in trouble
even when they have things

442
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:49,690
他们依旧麻烦缠身
their own way.

443
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:52,748
现在 假设形势反过来
Now, imagine the opposite situation.

444
00:27:52,751 --> 00:27:59,029
有大批的工人 他们得竞争上岗
You've got loads of workers, all of
this lot competing for a single job.

445
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:02,029
无疑  老板们乐开花
Then, well, no wonder he's smiling,

446
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:06,909
他们只需要付给工人
the capitalist only has to pay
the workers

447
00:28:06,909 --> 00:28:08,869
最低工资即可
the bare minimum.

448
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:13,388
这个桶 用马克思的话来说
This bucket is what Marx
would have called

449
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:15,589
就是失业人口构成的产业后备军
the industrial reserve army
of the unemployed.

450
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:19,748
只要那个桶是满的 竞争上岗
As long as that's full,
this lot can keep paying

451
00:28:19,751 --> 00:28:22,428
就能维持低工资并创造丰厚利润
very low wages
and keep making profits.

452
00:28:22,429 --> 00:28:26,468
除非最终引发大问题
Except, in the end,there's a problem.

453
00:28:26,469 --> 00:28:29,708
因为低薪的工人没钱消费
Cos badly paid workers
don't spend very much,

454
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:33,069
而一个经济体中 消费不足对商业是不利的
and not very much spending in an
economy is not good for business.

455
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:36,708
这又会引发危机  更多的资本家破产
You get another crisis,
more capitalists going bust,

456
00:28:36,709 --> 00:28:40,829
而这种危机更难愈合
and this crisis
is going to be harder to fix.

457
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:43,549
现在你知道为什么马克思认为
无论资产阶级怎么做
So, you can see why Marx thought
the capitalists were in trouble

458
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:44,630
他都会陷入困境了吧
no matter what they do.

459
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:47,388
他们从未想过要付给工人更多工资
They never want to pay
the workers more money.

460
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:50,549
他们一心只想逐利   但正是逐利的本性
They always need to make more
profit. But in seeking out profit,

461
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:53,708
最终会损毁他们赖以生存的基石
they end up eroding the basis on
which it's made.

462
00:28:53,709 --> 00:28:55,309
可以这么说 他们忘了
They've forgotten, if you like,

463
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:57,309
他们的钱最终是从哪儿来的
where their money
ultimately comes from.

464
00:28:57,310 --> 00:29:00,228
正如马克思的警句说的
The punch line, as ever with Marx,

465
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:04,150
资本主义注定灭亡
is that capitalism is doomed.

466
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:09,450
这就是工资是如何引发危机的
So, that's how problems with wages
can cause crises,

467
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:10,790
至少理论上是这样
at least in theory.

468
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:13,630
这套理论跟眼下的危机又有啥关系呢
But how is any of that
relevant to right now?

469
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:19,748
马克思主义者会说  那个玩偶比喻
A Marxist would say
that little parable with the toy men

470
00:29:19,751 --> 00:29:22,509
对当今的金融危机
tells you everything you need
to know about the financial

471
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,948
作了最好的说明
crisis we've just seen.

472
00:29:23,949 --> 00:29:25,070
事实上 他们会说
In fact, they'd say

473
00:29:25,071 --> 00:29:28,029
你可以把过去40年的世界历史
you could explain the last 40 years
of world history

474
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:30,948
解释为资本主义不择手段
entirely in terms
of capitalism's desperate need

475
00:29:30,949 --> 00:29:34,930
想要储备廉价劳动力
to have the advantages of a ready
supply of cheap labour,

476
00:29:34,931 --> 00:29:36,569
但不付出成本的历史
but none of the costs.

477
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:39,290
你不必把我的话当真
And you don't have to take
my word for it.

478
00:29:45,189 --> 00:29:48,109
让我们用马克思主义理论
Let's take a look at the last
40 years of history

479
00:29:48,109 --> 00:29:50,789
回顾过去40年的历史
through the prism of Marxist theories.

480
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:54,029
看看他们是如何解释我们的遭遇的
To show how they might explain
the mess we're in.

481
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:57,589
想象一个马克思主义的电视台
An imaginary Marxist Broadcasting
Corporation

482
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:01,748
70年代的阶级斗争
肯定是他们眼里的好时光
would see it all as a good-old,
1970s-style class struggle.

483
00:30:01,751 --> 00:30:07,029
通常 他们把世界分为工人和资本家
As usual, the world's divided
between workers and capitalists,

484
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:10,909
他们总是在为分得更多的蛋糕而争斗
always fighting to get a bigger
slice of the pie.

485
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:14,309
马克思主义者会说  危机频频爆发
And the crisis happened,
Marxists would argue,

486
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:17,971
原因是 劳资斗争中获胜的常常是资本家
because the capitalists have been
coming out on top a bit too often.

487
00:30:19,469 --> 00:30:21,669
争议的焦点是工资
The fight is over wages.

488
00:30:21,669 --> 00:30:25,188
资本家想压低工资 而工人想挣更多
Capitalists want to pay less -
the workers want to get more.

489
00:30:25,189 --> 00:30:27,109
同意的请举手
All those in favour, please show.

490
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:34,150
70年代 强大的工会组织通过抗争
为自己赢得高工资
In the '70s, powerful trade unions
battled to keep wages high.

491
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:42,270
但到了80年代  胜利的天平倒向资方
Then we come to the '80s.
Fight back time for capitalists.

492
00:30:45,909 --> 00:30:49,069
在马克思主义者看来 
玛格丽特・撒切尔和罗纳德・里根
Marx would have seen
Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Regan

493
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:53,309
代表的完全是资方的利益
as acting purely in the interests
of the capitalist bosses.

494
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:57,029
他们的政府帮助资方
It was their governments
that helped business

495
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:59,990
消除任何障碍  以削减工资
by getting rid of the obstacles
that made it hard to cut wages.

496
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:03,109
恐吓跟暴力
The violence and intimidation

497
00:31:03,109 --> 00:31:05,388
永远不会成功
we have seen should never have happened.

498
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:09,388
他们是激进主义者  是人民内部的敌人
It is the work of extremists.
It is the enemy within.

499
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:12,549
48小时内 如果他们还不回岗位
If they do not report for work
in 48 hours

500
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:15,990
他们就永远别回来了 等待他们的是失业
they have forfeited their jobs
and will be terminated.

501
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:19,351
发言完毕
End of statement.

502
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:24,428
对于马克思主义的电台来说
So, for the Marxist
Broadcasting Corporation,

503
00:31:24,429 --> 00:31:27,150
自1980年代起  胜利的一直是资方
the capitalist won in the 1980s,
and they kept on winning.

504
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:34,069
工人们享受的高工资和就业保障
The guaranteed high wages
and job security

505
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:37,669
随着70年代一去不复返了
that workers had enjoyed
until the seventies had gone.

506
00:31:39,709 --> 00:31:43,109
下行的薪资走势
And downward pressure on wages
started to lay the seeds

507
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:45,790
为今天的危机埋下了祸根
of the crisis we see today.

508
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:56,669
节目很棒  事情真是这样吗
Well, it's great telly.
Is it actually true?

509
00:31:56,669 --> 00:31:59,909
马克思的历史观在一件事情上是正确的
Well, we know the Marxist view of
history is right about one thing,

510
00:31:59,909 --> 00:32:01,549
至少对英国和美国是这样
at least in Britain and America.

511
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:05,388
过去几年来 处于金子塔顶的人收入激增
Earnings at the very top have
soared in the last few years

512
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,948
而其他人的剩余价值被榨干
and everyone else has been squeezed.

513
00:32:07,949 --> 00:32:11,309
在英国 危机爆发前高速发展的十年间
In Britain, real earnings have been
flat or falling

514
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:14,829
人们的实际收入没怎么长 甚至下跌了
for the best part of ten years,
since before the crisis.

515
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:19,230
而在美国 70年代以来都是那样
And in America, that's been
happening since the '70s.

516
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:25,869
美国全职的男性工人
In the United States,
a full-time male worker,

517
00:32:25,869 --> 00:32:30,309
取中位数的话 
他们的平均工资30多年没变了
median income has stagnated
for a third of a century.

518
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:31,948
没有增加
No increase.

519
00:32:31,949 --> 00:32:38,309
家庭收入跟15年前一样
Household income today is the same
as it was fifteen years ago.

520
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:40,829
增长的部分都被塔顶的人吸收了
All the increase to the income
has gone to the top.

521
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:44,228
在美国  1%最富有的家庭
The share of income
in the United States

522
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:49,029
他们的财富占全国财富的比率
that was going to the top 1%
of the households

523
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:54,069
20年前是12%
20 years ago, was around 12%.

524
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:59,949
如今 这个数字增加到23%
Today that share is closer to 23%.

525
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:07,069
在英国  形势还不至于那样
Things haven't gone
that far in the UK

526
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:10,390
但不平的现象在加剧
but inequality is certainly
creeping up the agenda.

527
00:33:12,709 --> 00:33:16,790
是贪婪的资本家掏空了工人的钱袋吗
So, have the greedy capitalists been
picking the pockets of the workers?

528
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:23,829
为什么我说 财富都流进高层了呢
So, why do I think all that money's
been flowing to the top?

529
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:26,069
我不认为这其中有什么阴谋
Well, I don't think
it's a big conspiracy

530
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:28,748
只不过 社会和政治的变革
but there have been social
and political changes

531
00:33:28,751 --> 00:33:30,388
造成了这一变化
that have made a difference.

532
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:32,708
过去 我们有强有力的工会
We used to have really big unions,

533
00:33:32,709 --> 00:33:36,468
曾对富人刻以高额的税率
we used to have very high tax rates
on rich people.

534
00:33:36,469 --> 00:33:39,029
还有一定的社会规范
And we had social norms.

535
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:41,669
银行家们可不能
It just wasn't done for the people
running a bank

536
00:33:41,669 --> 00:33:44,468
给自己开天价的工资
to take a huge chunk of the profits
for themselves.

537
00:33:44,469 --> 00:33:47,148
这些都限制了社会不平等现象的恶化
Those things helped keep
a lid on inequality.

538
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,069
但这些都不再有了
We don't have them anymore.

539
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:51,109
但问题最关键的还在于
But really crucial to all of this

540
00:33:51,109 --> 00:33:54,150
我们的经济结构变了
has been the changing
structure of our economy.

541
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:03,228
新的科技在其中扮演了重要角色
A lot of it's down to new technology.

542
00:34:07,668 --> 00:34:11,429
工作由机器取代了人手
Work previously done by hand
is now done by machines.

543
00:34:14,308 --> 00:34:17,947
不再需要那么多工人了
机器能胜任任何工作
Fewer workers needed, there are more
competing for every job,

544
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:20,668
资方现在能进一步压低人工了
meaning bosses can pay them less.

545
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:26,429
也许 全球化是更重要的因素
But perhaps the most significant
factor is globalisation.

546
00:34:27,668 --> 00:34:30,708
贸易壁垒进一步取消
With falling barriers
to trade around the world,

547
00:34:30,708 --> 00:34:35,429
全球化使资方能获得巨大的廉价劳动力
global business has gained access to
a giant new pool of cheaper labour.

548
00:34:36,668 --> 00:34:39,387
伴随着新兴市场的是
You have brought into the market now

549
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:42,507
上亿的新劳力
millions and millions of new workers.

550
00:34:42,509 --> 00:34:46,867
中国 印度 以及亚洲其它国家
In China, in India,
in other parts of Asia,

551
00:34:46,869 --> 00:34:50,108
还有南美的巴西等国
in parts of South America,
Brazil, for instance.

552
00:34:50,108 --> 00:34:54,428
全球化的过程
So, that process has transformed

553
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:58,669
使得劳资比例被纳入到全球范围
the capital labour ratio
on a global scale.

554
00:34:58,669 --> 00:35:03,948
举例来说 一位分析师可以坐在菲律宾
For example an analyst can as well
be sitting in the Philippines

555
00:35:03,949 --> 00:35:07,748
或是孟买的家中工作
or in Mumbai to do the job
that is done

556
00:35:07,748 --> 00:35:11,350
而同样的工作在纽约的成本就很高
at a much higher price in New York.

557
00:35:15,469 --> 00:35:18,109
很多富裕国家的工人们
Many workers in the rich countries

558
00:35:18,109 --> 00:35:20,828
不得不面临数以亿计的
are now competing with
an industrial reserve army

559
00:35:20,831 --> 00:35:23,909
产业后备军的竞争
running into the billions.

560
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:30,188
我认为新兴市场经济体
I think, in emerging market economies,

561
00:35:30,188 --> 00:35:33,547
他们会完全欢迎眼下发生的事
there'd be an overwhelming vote
in favour of what has happened

562
00:35:33,549 --> 00:35:36,388
因为几乎所有人的日子都比以前好过
because almost everyone is better off
than they were,

563
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:37,469
他们早盼着这天了
and would have been.

564
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:40,669
然而很少证据表明 在发达国家
But that's less evident in the
industrialised world

565
00:35:40,669 --> 00:35:44,067
低收入者的工资走低
where many lower paid people
have become even lower paid

566
00:35:44,069 --> 00:35:47,631
与新兴市场国家有关  这必须得注意
relative to those who have prospered,
and that is a concern.

567
00:35:51,469 --> 00:35:52,949
二战后很多年
For years after World War II

568
00:35:52,949 --> 00:35:55,027
我们很肯定地认为马克思错了
we could be pretty sure
Marx was wrong.

569
00:35:55,031 --> 00:35:58,188
资本主义不是很兴盛吗
Where you had capitalism,
it was working pretty well.

570
00:35:58,188 --> 00:36:02,388
潮水上涨不是托起了所有的船只了吗
You could talk about
a rising tide lifting all boats,

571
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:05,109
但是 看看今天的全球经济
but you look at the global economy today

572
00:36:05,109 --> 00:36:07,987
你会发现马克思眼中的资本主义
and I think you see a capitalism
that Marx would recognise.

573
00:36:07,989 --> 00:36:11,388
它使中国数百万人摆脱了贫困
It's lifted hundreds of millions
out of poverty in China,

574
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:13,669
但对于西方的普通人而言
but for most ordinary people
in the West,

575
00:36:13,669 --> 00:36:15,587
这套制度不再适用
the system's not working at all.

576
00:36:15,589 --> 00:36:20,589
他们与资本主义的婚姻看似要破裂了
For them, capitalism's not coming
through on its side of the deal.

577
00:36:25,228 --> 00:36:27,067
有分析亮起警报
It's an analysis that rings true

578
00:36:27,069 --> 00:36:30,549
甚至世界最大经济体的领导者都意识到
even for the leader
of the world's biggest economy.

579
00:36:32,469 --> 00:36:34,027
早在经济衰退来临前
Long before the recession,

580
00:36:34,031 --> 00:36:37,669
制造业的就业机会就开始向海外转移
jobs in manufacturing began
leaving our shores.

581
00:36:37,669 --> 00:36:40,388
科技令商业更高效
Technology made businesses
more efficient

582
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:43,587
但同时也淘汰了一些行业
but also made some jobs obsolete.

583
00:36:43,589 --> 00:36:47,308
精英们发现他们的荷包前所未有的增长
Folks at the top saw their incomes
rise like never before.

584
00:36:47,308 --> 00:36:50,109
但大多数努力工作的美国人却深受煎熬
But most hardworking Americans
struggled

585
00:36:50,109 --> 00:36:53,669
开支上升  工资却没有上升
with costs that were growing,
pay cheques that weren't

586
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:56,228
债台不断高筑
and personal debt that kept piling up.

587
00:37:10,669 --> 00:37:14,027
马克思会说我们现在遭受的严重的经济危机
Marx would say this squeeze on wages
was the root cause

588
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:19,067
其根源就在于资本家榨取剩余价值
of the huge economic crisis
that we've been living through.

589
00:37:19,069 --> 00:37:24,748
但马克思主义者的解释有个问题
But you might see a problem
with the Marxist explanation.

590
00:37:24,748 --> 00:37:27,388
如果什么都归结为低工资
If it was all down to low wages,

591
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:29,788
那你就能预期  危机将由
you'd expect the crisis
to have started

592
00:37:29,788 --> 00:37:33,067
民生方面或实体经济引发
where people spend their pay,
out in the real economy.

593
00:37:33,069 --> 00:37:34,109
两者必居其一
One way or another,

594
00:37:34,111 --> 00:37:37,507
二战后绝大多数的衰退都是这么开始的
that is how most of the recessions
since the war have got started.

595
00:37:37,509 --> 00:37:40,587
但这次 使城市沦陷的不是街头
But this time it wasn't the high
street that sank the city...

596
00:37:40,589 --> 00:37:42,428
它完全来自另一个方向
it was the other way round.

597
00:37:42,429 --> 00:37:46,067
2008年 引爆全球经济危机的
The explosion that rocked the global
economy in 2008

598
00:37:46,069 --> 00:37:48,600
竟是银行内部
was detonated deep inside the banks.

599
00:37:53,308 --> 00:37:57,388
那么 马克思是怎么把低工资
跟劣质银行联系在一起的呢
So, how would Marx link low wages
to troubled banks?

600
00:37:57,390 --> 00:38:00,788
答案是 他视资本具有极强的适应能力
The answer is - he saw
capital as endlessly adaptable.

601
00:38:00,788 --> 00:38:03,908
它解决低薪资问题的同时
It could solve one problem -
low wages...

602
00:38:03,909 --> 00:38:06,509
又创造出新的问题
but only at the cost
of creating another.

603
00:38:09,109 --> 00:38:11,388
记住 马克思从未低估过资本主义
Remember, Marx didn't
underestimate capitalism.

604
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:13,308
他只是认为它有天生的缺陷
He thought it was
fundamentally flawed.

605
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:15,507
并没有说资本主义是愚笨的
He didn't think it was stupid.

606
00:38:15,509 --> 00:38:18,708
如果大多数人的收入不足以
If large parts of the population
weren't being paid enough

607
00:38:18,708 --> 00:38:22,788
满足他们的需求
马克思绝不会惊叹于
to support demand, well, he wouldn't
have been at all surprised

608
00:38:22,788 --> 00:38:25,507
资本主义又一项闪亮的发明
to hear that capitalists had come up
with a brilliant solution,

609
00:38:25,509 --> 00:38:27,031
信用卡 
the credit card.

610
00:38:28,669 --> 00:38:31,027
你确定都带齐了吗 钱呢
Now are you sure you've got
everything, Money?

611
00:38:31,031 --> 00:38:32,149
我看看  酒 ...
Let me see, wine...

612
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:36,868
有了消费信贷 即便没钱
With consumer credit, people can
carry on spending,

613
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:39,388
人们都可以继续消费
even if they haven't got the money.

614
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:44,788
经济情况良好 资本家仍有利可图
The economy stays afloat, and the
capitalists still make their profit.

615
00:38:49,109 --> 00:38:53,547
信用卡对于资本主义的顽疾倒是一剂良方
So, credit provided an answer
to all of capitalism's woes.

616
00:38:53,549 --> 00:38:55,547
但这只能持续一段时间
But only for a while.

617
00:38:55,549 --> 00:38:58,788
记得不 马克思认为资本主义制度
有其先天的缺陷
Remember, Marx thought the system
was fundamentally flawed.

618
00:38:58,788 --> 00:39:01,669
资本家也许都很聪明
They might be very clever,
these capitalists,

619
00:39:01,669 --> 00:39:07,027
但现在 他们比以往任何时候
都苟延残喘
but now, more than ever,
they were living on borrowed time.

620
00:39:13,748 --> 00:39:17,587
其实 这不仅仅是信用卡的问题
As we know,
it went well beyond credit cards.

621
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:20,388
危机爆发的根本原因
What ultimately brought the crisis
to a head

622
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:22,948
是巨额的抵押贷款
was the billions borrowed on mortgages.

623
00:39:22,949 --> 00:39:26,908
人们以为他们的物业将一直升值
People thought the value of their
house would keep going up for ever.

624
00:39:26,909 --> 00:39:29,908
住房抵押贷款这事很妙
Housing credit is beautiful

625
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:32,388
因为如果房价一直上涨
because if your house price is increasing

626
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:36,109
依靠房子的升值作抵押贷款
and you're borrowing against the
increase in value of your house,

627
00:39:36,109 --> 00:39:39,109
你都不会感到是在举债
you don't feel you're borrowing
your way into debt.

628
00:39:39,109 --> 00:39:42,027
但其实 你是在举债
But, of course, you are.

629
00:39:42,031 --> 00:39:46,428
房贷现象在美国大规模上演
In America,it happened on a massive scale.

630
00:39:46,429 --> 00:39:53,308
那儿 资产阶级越来越富有
There, as we know, the capitalists
were getting richer and richer.

631
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:56,388
有点闲钱 他们不会都用来消费
They couldn't spend
all of their extra money.

632
00:39:56,390 --> 00:40:00,388
一如往常 在逐利本性的驱使下
Driven, as ever, by the desire
to make more profit,

633
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:04,708
他们把钱投入到风险越来越大的项目中
they lent it out in riskier
and riskier ways.

634
00:40:04,708 --> 00:40:09,308
这种贷款方式的名字您也许不陌生
The name given to this lending might
well be familiar.

635
00:40:11,308 --> 00:40:13,069
次级房贷
Subprime.

636
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:20,149
美国发生的实际上是
What we did is, as the incomes

637
00:40:20,149 --> 00:40:22,669
当大多数美国人的收入停滞
of most Americans were stagnating,

638
00:40:22,669 --> 00:40:24,027
甚至下跌
or even declining,

639
00:40:24,031 --> 00:40:27,027
有人却说：“别为这担心
we said, "Don't let it bother you.

640
00:40:27,031 --> 00:40:30,067
继续消费  就当收入在涨”
"Keep spending
as if your income was going up."

641
00:40:30,069 --> 00:40:32,669
这套还真管用
And they did that very well.

642
00:40:32,669 --> 00:40:35,507
谁会反对呢  银行还在挣钱
I mean, who would oppose it?
The banks who are making money?

643
00:40:35,509 --> 00:40:38,828
业主也买到了房子
The households
who are getting their house?

644
00:40:38,831 --> 00:40:41,067
政客把选民哄得爽歪歪
The politicians who have happy
constituents?

645
00:40:41,069 --> 00:40:42,507
没有一个人
I mean, there is nobody

646
00:40:42,509 --> 00:40:46,308
整个过程没人不爽  直到最后崩盘
who's going to be unhappy
in this process until it collapses.

647
00:40:48,669 --> 00:40:51,788
最后怎么收场的我们都明白
And we all know how it ended.

648
00:40:51,788 --> 00:40:54,188
现在回想起来 问题很清楚
In retrospect, it seems obvious.

649
00:40:54,188 --> 00:40:56,069
借贷给没有偿还能力的人
Lending to people
who couldn't afford it

650
00:40:56,071 --> 00:40:59,828
这怎么可能永久地解决问题呢
wasn't a lasting solution to anything.

651
00:40:59,831 --> 00:41:02,669
最终房地产泡沫破裂
It led to a housing bubble which burst,

652
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:05,228
危及一些世界级大银行
threatening some of the world's
biggest banks,

653
00:41:05,228 --> 00:41:07,987
拜全球经济一体化之赐
and thanks to our integrated world,

654
00:41:07,989 --> 00:41:09,908
肇始于美国的危机
what started in the United States

655
00:41:09,909 --> 00:41:13,388
波及整个经济体
spread and infected the entire system,

656
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:15,228
全球经济随之衰退
causing a global recession.

657
00:41:17,989 --> 00:41:22,388
这就是马克思主义者对危机的解释
So, here's the Marxist explanation
for the crisis we've just seen.

658
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:23,908
经济的全球化
You've got a global economy

659
00:41:23,909 --> 00:41:26,308
使商业越做越大
with businesses
getting better and better

660
00:41:26,308 --> 00:41:28,708
薪资压低产生出更多利润
at squeezing wages
and pushing up profits.

661
00:41:28,708 --> 00:41:30,467
但有一个问题
But there's a problem.

662
00:41:30,469 --> 00:41:32,308
生产过剩
They're producing a lot of stuff

663
00:41:32,308 --> 00:41:34,467
但工人无力购买
that the workers can no longer afford,

664
00:41:34,469 --> 00:41:36,908
而热钱还在追逐新的投资方向
and a lot of profits looking for a new home.

665
00:41:36,909 --> 00:41:41,788
于是 全球的房产泡沫成为新的方向
A global property bubble provided
an answer to both those problems.

666
00:41:41,788 --> 00:41:45,868
整个系统继续运行 但债务堆积如山
The system was kept afloat
on a mountain of debt

667
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:50,708
它的崩塌只是时间问题
but it was only a matter of time
before it all came crashing down.

668
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:55,031
资本主义当时貌似强大 但那只是暂时的
Capitalism's only ever as strong
as its latest, temporary fix.

669
00:41:58,549 --> 00:42:03,467
这听起来像离奇的传说 很多人会说
It's an extraordinary tale
and a lot of people would say

670
00:42:03,469 --> 00:42:06,547
这完全是一派胡言
it's completely wrong.

671
00:42:06,549 --> 00:42:08,308
马克思主义说的不对
Marxism doesn't actually work,

672
00:42:08,308 --> 00:42:11,228
它不过就是哗众取宠 能不时吸引人罢了
but it keeps coming back,
cos it makes for a good story.

673
00:42:11,228 --> 00:42:14,149
我不认为危机跟低工资有什么关系
I don't think low wages played any
role at all in causing the crisis.

674
00:42:14,149 --> 00:42:17,067
危机的根源在政府和中央银行
The crisis was caused by governments
and central banks

675
00:42:17,069 --> 00:42:19,908
向市场注入了太多低息贷款
flooding the market with cheap credit
and cheap money

676
00:42:19,909 --> 00:42:23,027
因为政客们不想看到经济出现拐点
because politicians don't like the
downturn in an economy

677
00:42:23,031 --> 00:42:24,669
那会加大失业人口
that throws people out of work.

678
00:42:24,669 --> 00:42:27,067
我认为从某种意义上说
I think it may have,to some degree,

679
00:42:27,069 --> 00:42:29,188
政府增加了负债额 
increased the level of indebtedness

680
00:42:29,188 --> 00:42:31,908
不仅使人们陷入危机 
that people went into the crisis with,

681
00:42:31,909 --> 00:42:35,388
更使危机加剧
which, I think, intensifies
how deep the crisis became,

682
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:38,027
但这还不是根本的原因
but it wasn't the underlying cause.

683
00:42:38,031 --> 00:42:40,589
是整个大环境使情况更为恶化
It was a contextual factor
which made it a bit worse.

684
00:42:42,228 --> 00:42:48,067
即便马克思的思想一直都被认为是有害的
但其低工资促成危机的理论
But the idea that low wages
may have contributed to the crisis

685
00:42:48,069 --> 00:42:51,788
越来越被人所接受
is gaining ground, even if the name
Marx is as toxic as ever.

686
00:42:54,949 --> 00:42:58,228
乔治・马格纳斯是全球顶级银行的
George Magnus
is a senior economic adviser

687
00:42:58,228 --> 00:43:02,228
资深经济顾问
to one of the world's leading banks.

688
00:43:02,228 --> 00:43:05,308
危机爆发后 您写了很多有关马克思的文章
You've been writing quite a lot
about Marx since this crisis started.

689
00:43:05,308 --> 00:43:06,909
您怎么重新评价他的呢
How did you come to look at him again?

690
00:43:06,909 --> 00:43:09,388
实际上 从这个交易所就能理解
Actually it was on this trading floor.

691
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:13,748
雷曼倒下前的一个周末
It was probably the weekend
before Lehman's went bust,

692
00:43:13,748 --> 00:43:16,748
这个地方通常有些喧闹
and it's normally a little bit noisy,

693
00:43:16,748 --> 00:43:18,188
但那时
but at the time it was...

694
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:21,388
这里安静地连掉根针都能听见
you could hear a pin drop,
it was that deathly quiet

695
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:25,908
我感觉全球金融体系都快崩溃了
and I could almost feel, you know,
that the global system was frozen.

696
00:43:25,909 --> 00:43:28,788
真是惊恐万分
And it was quite a scary thought.

697
00:43:28,788 --> 00:43:32,308
这使我又重新回顾了
It took me back to a lot of the
things that I used to read about

698
00:43:32,308 --> 00:43:34,388
我年轻时曾经看过的很多东西
and study when I was much younger...

699
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:38,149
那会儿 读马克思完全是为了好玩
the days when I actually read Marx for fun.

700
00:43:38,149 --> 00:43:40,388
你还写了文章 发表后有什么反响
And you wrote about that,
and what was the reaction?

701
00:43:40,388 --> 00:43:42,308
我得说 我收到了很多恐吓信
I did get a lot of hate mail,
I have to say.

702
00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:46,748
很多人对社会主义 马克思主义
There are a lot of people
who were quite opposed to the idea

703
00:43:46,748 --> 00:43:49,149
的思想非常反感
that anything that was
socialistic or Marxist,

704
00:43:49,149 --> 00:43:53,587
主流们对之很警惕
you know, could be at all considered
serious in the mainstream.

705
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:57,388
很多恐吓信件来自美国
A lot of this hate mail, I have to
say, came from the United States

706
00:43:57,390 --> 00:44:00,228
我被人责骂为奥巴马的傀儡
and I was accused of being, you know,
an Obama clone and...

707
00:44:00,228 --> 00:44:03,228
总统奥巴马  大家熟知的马克思主义者
是的 大家熟知的马克思主义者
President Obama - the well-known
Marxist. The well-known Marxist!

708
00:44:03,228 --> 00:44:04,788
真是不可思议
Very mysterious forces.

709
00:44:04,788 --> 00:44:08,788
有很多反对之声来自
So, there was a lot of negative
reaction from, I think

710
00:44:08,788 --> 00:44:12,149
你能预计到的那些
people that probably
predictably, you know,

711
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:15,669
意识形态固化的人
had already tied their own
ideological colours to the mast.

712
00:44:15,669 --> 00:44:18,027
发现马克思的真知灼见
But the people who do find value
in Marx

713
00:44:18,031 --> 00:44:21,031
并不意味着就是马克思主义者
aren't necessarily going
to follow him all the way.

714
00:44:24,949 --> 00:44:26,948
我认为 马克思有助于我们廓清问题
I think Marx helps
in framing the problem,

715
00:44:26,949 --> 00:44:30,669
但考虑到我们身处不同的环境
but I think the solutions
have to be different,

716
00:44:30,669 --> 00:44:34,027
解决之道真的很难
given the different environment
we are in.

717
00:44:34,031 --> 00:44:39,669
但有一点除外 马克思坚称
资本主义的陷落不可避免
Except, Marx would insist,
the trap is inescapable.

718
00:44:39,669 --> 00:44:43,507
资本家必须全力追逐利润
Capitalists must seek profit
above all else

719
00:44:43,509 --> 00:44:44,827
否则他们就会破产
or they'll go out of business.

720
00:44:44,828 --> 00:44:46,188
所以 他们凭什么会
So, why would they ever choose

721
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:48,788
让渡给工人更多份额呢
to give workers a bigger share of
the pie?

722
00:44:48,788 --> 00:44:55,149
马克思说 我们得走出危机
What Marx would say is that we have
to look for ways out of this crisis,

723
00:44:55,149 --> 00:44:58,308
但那得放眼远方
which look beyond the restoration

724
00:44:58,308 --> 00:44:59,748
资产阶级是不能指望的
of capitalist class power.

725
00:44:59,752 --> 00:45:03,388
我想 此时正是我们重新思考
And, I think, this is a time when
we actually need to start thinking

726
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:06,031
革命性的解决方案的时候了
about the revolutionary
solution again.

727
00:45:09,308 --> 00:45:11,788
但说到造反 谁造谁的反呢
But who, exactly,
is revolting against who?

728
00:45:11,788 --> 00:45:15,587
马克思把世界分为工人和资本家
Marx divided the world
neatly into workers and capitalists

729
00:45:15,589 --> 00:45:19,788
但今天看来 这一僵硬的划分
变得模糊不清
but today his stark distinction
is incredibly blurred.

730
00:45:19,788 --> 00:45:23,350
老板们也在为自己工作
工人们也分得他们的份额
Bosses work for themselves
and workers own shares.

731
00:45:30,031 --> 00:45:33,507
现代社会下 
大多数人的利益与社会休戚相关
In our modern world, enough of us do
have a stake in the system,

732
00:45:33,509 --> 00:45:36,547
移动电话也好 退休计划也罢
whether mobile phones
or pension plans,

733
00:45:36,549 --> 00:45:39,509
没人想要革命
to stave off talk of armed revolt.

734
00:45:42,308 --> 00:45:44,788
但资本主义下失意的人怎么办
But what about the people
capitalism's failing?

735
00:45:44,788 --> 00:45:47,870
马克思怎么关照这些人呢
What does Marx have to say to them?

736
00:45:53,031 --> 00:45:57,188
马克思对现代社会有深刻的洞见
这着实令人惊讶
It's really amazing how well Marx
seems to understand our world,

737
00:45:57,188 --> 00:46:00,388
我们比任何时候都与他人紧密相连
where we're more interconnected
than he could ever have imagined

738
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:04,428
资本主义的各个方面  好与坏
and where all the faces
of capitalism, good and bad,

739
00:46:04,429 --> 00:46:08,109
都呈现于世界任何角落
are now on display in pretty much
every corner of the globe.

740
00:46:08,109 --> 00:46:10,388
但马克思说过一句著名的话
But he was the one who famously said

741
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:14,788
重要的不是解释这个世界
而是改变这个世界
it wasn't enough to interpret the
world - the point was to change it.

742
00:46:14,788 --> 00:46:19,828
如果你问他 我们该做什么来取代资本主义
If you ask him what exactly we're
supposed to replace capitalism with,

743
00:46:19,831 --> 00:46:23,429
那他很可能无言以对
well, he had remarkably little
to say about that.

744
00:46:28,031 --> 00:46:30,109
在其晚年
As Marx entered his final years,

745
00:46:30,109 --> 00:46:32,788
马克思似乎对一切都安然接受
he seemed quite content
with the way things were.

746
00:46:36,228 --> 00:46:39,027
他穷了一辈子
He'd been poor
for a lot of his life,

747
00:46:39,031 --> 00:46:43,429
但到1865年 他已有足够的钱移居伦敦市郊
but by 1856, he had enough money
to move to London's suburbs.

748
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:51,027
年轻的叛乱分子
如今看来就像是体制内人士
The young firebrand now looked
like part of the establishment.

749
00:46:51,031 --> 00:46:55,507
他会在汉普特斯西斯公园漫步
He would spend his day
walking around Hampstead Heath

750
00:46:55,509 --> 00:46:58,149
担忧自己的理财状况
and he would worry about personal finances,

751
00:46:58,149 --> 00:47:00,308
还有他的女儿们
he would worry about his daughters

752
00:47:00,308 --> 00:47:02,828
钢琴课的花销
and the expense of their piano lessons.

753
00:47:02,831 --> 00:47:08,149
从很多方面看 他过的就是资产阶级的生活
I mean, he lived a remarkably
bourgeois life, in many ways.

754
00:47:09,909 --> 00:47:14,828
后来 马克思成为世界革命的权威
In his later years, Marx was the
world authority on the revolution,

755
00:47:14,831 --> 00:47:17,388
但他本人似乎并不急于看到革命的发生
but he didn't seem to be in a hurry
to make it happen.

756
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:20,109
来自世界各地 年轻的
头脑发热的社会主义者
Young hot-headed socialists
from around the world

757
00:47:20,109 --> 00:47:23,587
慕名来到北伦敦 希望获得他的支持
would come to North London to pay
their respects, win his support.

758
00:47:23,589 --> 00:47:26,831
马克思高兴的等待他们的到来
Mr M seemed happy to watch and wait.

759
00:47:32,149 --> 00:47:35,467
马克思完全鄙视恐怖主义
Marx only really had contempt
for terrorists,

760
00:47:35,469 --> 00:47:38,788
反对激进的政治运动
those who were seeking
to fast-forward political progress

761
00:47:38,788 --> 00:47:41,908
反对专横的暴力革命
by having change
through arbitrary violence.

762
00:47:41,909 --> 00:47:45,669
要紧的是改革经济基础
You needed the economic fundamentals
in place

763
00:47:45,669 --> 00:47:49,031
那才是正确的革命方式
for a proper revolution to succeed.

764
00:47:50,748 --> 00:47:54,149
要理解为什么马克思不想要冒进的革命
To understand why he didn't want
to rush revolution

765
00:47:54,149 --> 00:47:57,547
我们必须更深入地了解马克思主义的理论
we need to understand -
for the last time, I promise...

766
00:47:57,549 --> 00:47:59,268
这也是我最后要提请大家注意的
a bit more Marxist theory.

767
00:48:02,748 --> 00:48:09,027
一如往常 
马克思对世界史做了宏大的分析
As usual, he had a grand analysis
of the history of the world.

768
00:48:09,031 --> 00:48:12,587
他洞见到 人类历经穴居时代
He saw the great
sweep of humanity's endeavours,

769
00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:14,507
希腊罗马时期的奴隶社会
from the caveman,

770
00:48:14,509 --> 00:48:18,388
以及之后诸侯割据的封建社会
to the slave societies
of Greece and Rome,

771
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:22,788
这都是人类自身的巨大飞跃
to the feudalism
of kings and castles.

772
00:48:22,788 --> 00:48:25,587
此后 基于劳资关系的资本主义社会
All of which was replaced, in turn,
by our own capitalist system

773
00:48:25,589 --> 00:48:28,149
取而代之
of bosses and workers.

774
00:48:29,748 --> 00:48:31,428
这一制度绝对不公平
Incredibly unfair,

775
00:48:31,429 --> 00:48:34,390
但生产力也绝对惊人
but also incredibly productive.

776
00:48:37,669 --> 00:48:40,308
马克思说  只有资本主义
Marx said only when we'd got
everything we could

777
00:48:40,308 --> 00:48:41,308
不再能给予我们所需的时候
out of capitalism

778
00:48:41,310 --> 00:48:44,631
我们才会发动革命
could we afford to have a revolution.

779
00:48:48,831 --> 00:48:54,348
用他的话说就是
“资本主义私有制的丧钟就要响了
In his words, "the knell of
capitalist private property sounds,

780
00:48:54,350 --> 00:48:56,868
剥夺者就要被剥夺了。”
"the expropriators are expropriated,

781
00:48:56,870 --> 00:49:00,109
资本主义的一切
"all to be replaced by

782
00:49:00,109 --> 00:49:02,948
都将被取代
"more or less nothing."

783
00:49:02,949 --> 00:49:06,948
但令人烦恼的是 他并没有指明方向
Irritatingly there's next to no
alternative laid out.

784
00:49:06,949 --> 00:49:09,388
总的来说 马克思
Marx, basically,

785
00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:12,507
没有给我们设计什么蓝图
was not the one who simply gave us a
blueprint, you know,

786
00:49:12,509 --> 00:49:14,388
资本主义完了后 怎么个五步曲啦
five stages after capitalism...

787
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:17,149
共产主义的基本方针啦
communism, here you have the basic
guidelines,

788
00:49:17,149 --> 00:49:18,669
行动指南啦 等等
what to do, and so on.

789
00:49:18,669 --> 00:49:20,507
这些他都没说   完全留给了我们
No, no, it's up to us.

790
00:49:20,509 --> 00:49:23,109
他只是向我们打开了一扇窗
He just opened up the field.

791
00:49:23,109 --> 00:49:25,069
资本主义之外 还有什么体制吗
Is there an alternative to capitalism?

792
00:49:25,071 --> 00:49:27,027
我不知道
I've no idea.

793
00:49:27,031 --> 00:49:30,109
也许会有很多替代方案
Well, I suppose there could be all
kinds of alternatives.

794
00:49:30,109 --> 00:49:33,308
死寂  挨饿
Dead silence, starvation,

795
00:49:33,308 --> 00:49:35,308
或世界毁灭
or the end of the world or anything,

796
00:49:35,308 --> 00:49:37,509
但我是压根想不到还有什么出路
but I simply have no idea
if there is an alternative.

797
00:49:37,509 --> 00:49:40,388
我觉得这并不重要
It doesn't occur to me, it doesn't
seem to me to be important.

798
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:43,429
这就好比说  天气有得换吗
It's like saying,
is there an alternative to weather?

799
00:49:46,949 --> 00:49:50,828
马克思说  我们无法预测
Marx said we couldn't describe
what the next stage of human
development

800
00:49:50,831 --> 00:49:53,587
人类发展的下个阶段是什么  就好比
would look anymore than
a feudal serf

801
00:49:53,589 --> 00:49:56,388
一个农奴无法理解我们现代的生活一样
could have described
our lives today,

802
00:49:56,390 --> 00:49:59,027
对此 你或许会说“很公平嘛”
to which you might say,
"fair enough."

803
00:49:59,031 --> 00:50:01,390
除非你只把这当作是句俏皮话
Except you might also think
it was pretty telling.

804
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:04,027
毕竟 没人能给出一个
After all, nobody else
has been able to describe

805
00:50:04,031 --> 00:50:06,788
令人信服的资本主义的替代方案
a convincing alternative
to capitalism either.

806
00:50:09,831 --> 00:50:12,908
我想 如果马克思能再多活10年
I think he would have
written a lot more

807
00:50:12,909 --> 00:50:15,027
他会更多着墨于
had he lived ten years more,

808
00:50:15,031 --> 00:50:18,788
社会主义的共和制这一主题
on what a socialist republic
would look like,

809
00:50:18,788 --> 00:50:24,268
没准这真的能给世界带来安宁
谁又说得准呢
and who knows, but that might have
saved the world a lot of bother.

810
00:50:29,831 --> 00:50:34,788
没有他的蓝图  
接下来发生了什么我们都看到了
Without his blueprint,
we all know what happened next.

811
00:50:34,788 --> 00:50:38,149
与马克思预期相反 在富有的发达国家
There weren't any revolutions

812
00:50:38,149 --> 00:50:41,308
没有爆发革命
in the rich, developed countries,
as Marx predicted.

813
00:50:41,308 --> 00:50:46,547
相反 革命爆发在某个最穷的国家
Instead it happened in one
of the world's poorest nations.

814
00:50:46,549 --> 00:50:49,669
苏俄也许跟马克思想象的共产主义相距甚远
Soviet Russia may have left Marx
far behind

815
00:50:49,669 --> 00:50:53,149
但这确是一次尝试
but it was an attempt
to try something else,

816
00:50:53,149 --> 00:50:56,868
从它的失败中 我们获益良多
and many have drawn lessons
from its failure.

817
00:50:56,870 --> 00:51:00,149
事实上  资本主义各式各样
The truth is, at the moment there
are different forms of capitalism.

818
00:51:00,149 --> 00:51:03,669
但若谈及 你是想要
But on the big argument
about whether you really want

819
00:51:03,669 --> 00:51:06,308
资本主义还是共产主义这一大问题时
to have a communist system
or a capitalist one,

820
00:51:06,308 --> 00:51:08,828
我想 回答几乎是一定的
that is pretty much won everywhere
I think.

821
00:51:08,831 --> 00:51:11,828
资本主义有人性的
There are more humane versions
of capitalism

822
00:51:11,831 --> 00:51:15,188
也有残酷的
or more barbaric forms of capitalism.

823
00:51:15,188 --> 00:51:18,428
但要说完全取代它  我不看好
But I don't think there's a systemic
alternative to capitalism.

824
00:51:18,429 --> 00:51:21,188
未来有可能吗？  我想会吧
Will there ever be?
Yes, I would think so.

825
00:51:21,188 --> 00:51:23,748
没什么是永恒的嘛
I mean, you know, nothing is for ever.

826
00:51:23,748 --> 00:51:27,909
绝对没有 资本主义也不例外
Absolutely nothing,
and capitalism is not for ever.

827
00:51:31,308 --> 00:51:34,027
但任何人若要寻求一个更公平的制度
But anyone looking
for a fairer alternative

828
00:51:34,031 --> 00:51:38,388
千万不能忘记柏林墙以东发生的事
knows they can't ever repeat what
happened east of the Berlin Wall.

829
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:43,509
独裁 政治压迫 数百万生命被践踏
Dictatorship, political oppression
and millions of ruined lives.

830
00:51:50,788 --> 00:51:52,788
1945到1989年
From 1945 till 1989,

831
00:51:52,788 --> 00:51:57,027
这里是共产主义东德的重要监狱
this was the main remand centre
for political prisoners

832
00:51:57,031 --> 00:51:59,149
羁押的都是政治犯
in communist East Germany.

833
00:52:00,228 --> 00:52:02,989
如今 这里已是一座纪念馆
Today it's been turned into a memorial.

834
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:08,748
这儿奉行一个特别的理念
There was a special ideology.

835
00:52:08,748 --> 00:52:12,308
逮捕即有罪
Whoever we arrest,he or she is guilty.

836
00:52:14,669 --> 00:52:17,149
类似这样的地方或许解释了
It's possible that places like this

837
00:52:17,149 --> 00:52:21,027
为什么今日对资本主义 
即便批评再怎么严厉
explain why even capitalism's
toughest critics today

838
00:52:21,031 --> 00:52:24,069
但几乎很少有人提出要取而代之
seldom talk seriously
about replacing it.

839
00:52:29,549 --> 00:52:33,547
在欧洲的希腊等国到处是抗议之声
You can see with all these protests
in Europe, Greece, and so on.

840
00:52:33,549 --> 00:52:39,027
我曾在西班牙 希腊问人们相同的问题
I was in Spain, in Greece,
asking always the same question,

841
00:52:39,031 --> 00:52:41,109
那好 你们究竟要什么呢
OK, what do you want?

842
00:52:41,109 --> 00:52:44,109
除了一些纯粹诉诸道德的答案外
Apart from some purely
moralistic answers,

843
00:52:44,109 --> 00:52:46,788
没啥有益 建设性的答案
I didn't get any good,
complete proposals,

844
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:48,748
回答都类似
you know, answers like,

845
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:53,669
"是钱为人服务 而不是人为钱服务"
"Oh, money should serve people,
not people serving money."

846
00:52:53,669 --> 00:52:57,188
上帝啊 我肯定
连希特勒都会同意这套说辞
My God, Hitler and everyone would
have agreed with this, I'm sure.

847
00:52:57,188 --> 00:53:01,188
您也许会认为
You would have thought that with this
implosion of the banking system

848
00:53:01,188 --> 00:53:04,027
随着英美以及其它国家
at the heart of capitalism
in the United States

849
00:53:04,031 --> 00:53:07,388
居于资本主义核心地位的银行的崩盘
as well as the United Kingdom,
and so on,

850
00:53:07,390 --> 00:53:09,669
会有一股强大的势头
there would be a huge rush

851
00:53:09,669 --> 00:53:14,228
倒向马克思主义和激进的社会主义
to Marxism and extreme socialism.

852
00:53:14,228 --> 00:53:15,669
但那没有发生
That hasn't really happened.

853
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:20,989
这很让人惊讶  对此我很欣慰
It is quite surprising
and I'm very pleased.

854
00:53:25,031 --> 00:53:27,547
但如果人们对这样的地方记忆慢慢消退
But if memories
of this place do fade,

855
00:53:27,549 --> 00:53:31,308
是否又会想着给资本主义找替代方案呢
could there ever be
an alternative to capitalism,

856
00:53:31,308 --> 00:53:36,547
亦或者这个地方应该成为人们永恒的记忆呢
or should what happened here be
a lesson for all time?

857
00:53:36,549 --> 00:53:40,067
有人想寻求资本主义的替代方案
If someone wants to seek
an alternative to capitalism,

858
00:53:40,069 --> 00:53:43,027
并声称通过努力
and they're saying
by seeking that alternative

859
00:53:43,031 --> 00:53:48,669
能超越资本主义
that capitalism is a system
rather than a fact of life,

860
00:53:48,669 --> 00:53:50,948
他们或许还会说
and they're saying that,for instance,

861
00:53:50,949 --> 00:53:52,669
人性可以改变
that human nature can be altered,

862
00:53:52,669 --> 00:53:55,547
但这根本就是乌托邦
fundamentally they're revealing
themselves as utopian.

863
00:53:55,549 --> 00:53:57,308
而乌托邦的最大问题是
And the problem with utopia

864
00:53:57,308 --> 00:54:00,868
血海深渊是它唯一的路径
is that it can only ever be
approached across a sea of blood

865
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:02,308
而且它永远也实现不了
and you never arrive.

866
00:54:02,308 --> 00:54:05,788
说左翼人士是乌托邦 这是对我们的大不敬
This is my big mantra, when we
leftists are accused of utopians.

867
00:54:05,788 --> 00:54:09,547
或许吧   但真正的乌托邦是
Maybe, but the only real utopia
is to think

868
00:54:09,549 --> 00:54:11,948
面对现实 只作小修小补
that with some cosmetic changes

869
00:54:11,949 --> 00:54:15,989
真正的变革遥遥无期
things can go on indefinitely
the way they are now.

870
00:54:17,069 --> 00:54:21,748
起来 斯大林主义者们
Arise ye Stalins from your slumbers

871
00:54:21,748 --> 00:54:24,748
起来 全世界受苦的人
Arise ye criminals of want

872
00:54:25,748 --> 00:54:29,748
满腔的热血已经沸腾
For reason in revolt now thunders

873
00:54:29,748 --> 00:54:32,507
要为真理而斗争
And at last ends the age of can't. ?

874
00:54:32,509 --> 00:54:35,669
马克思卒于1883年
Marx died in 1883.

875
00:54:35,669 --> 00:54:39,308
在他墓前 马克思一生的挚友和同志
In a speech at his grave, his long
time friend and collaborator,

876
00:54:39,308 --> 00:54:40,669
弗里德里希・恩格斯称
Freidrich Engels,

877
00:54:40,669 --> 00:54:44,669
他的英名功绩将被时代所铭记
declared his name and work will
endure through the ages.

878
00:54:47,469 --> 00:54:51,109
他的名字的确深深地烙印于
20世纪大部分时间 
For most of the 20th century
his name did endure,

879
00:54:51,109 --> 00:54:53,708
但很多是对他的误解
though, usually, 
for all the wrong reasons.

880
00:54:56,748 --> 00:54:58,587
如今 21世纪
But now it's 21st century,

881
00:54:58,589 --> 00:55:02,069
这位过世已久的普鲁士人
会留给我们怎样的忠告呢
what can this long-dead Prussian
really say to us?

882
00:55:09,669 --> 00:55:11,908
我认为 最主要的是 马克思提醒我们
Fundamentally,
I think Marx reminds us

883
00:55:11,909 --> 00:55:17,350
如果资本主义不是为所有人服务
那它就没有生命力
that if capitalism doesn't work for
everyone, it might not work at all.

884
00:55:19,831 --> 00:55:23,027
面对目前发生的事
以及薪资方面的危机
When you look at what's happening
and the pressure on wages,

885
00:55:23,031 --> 00:55:26,669
你怎么理解 有人
can you understand why people are
sort of looking again

886
00:55:26,669 --> 00:55:29,027
如此怀念马克思主义呢
at some of Marx's analysis?

887
00:55:29,031 --> 00:55:31,308
是的  这是个热点
Yes, it... The big picture.

888
00:55:31,308 --> 00:55:34,348
劳资关系
The workers versus the capitalists.

889
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:37,828
毫无疑问 
在社会不平等 及收入分配方面
And there is no doubt that there
have been significant changes

890
00:55:37,831 --> 00:55:40,669
有显著的变化
in inequality and in the
distribution of income,

891
00:55:40,669 --> 00:55:45,467
这使我们对已有的成功和财富
which make you pause about
the benefits of the developments

892
00:55:45,469 --> 00:55:48,547
有了一丝疑虑
of output and prosperity
that we've seen.

893
00:55:48,549 --> 00:55:50,788
但我认为 你不能想当然
And I don't think you can afford

894
00:55:50,788 --> 00:55:54,228
以为市场经济的优势
to believe that the benefits
of a market economy

895
00:55:54,228 --> 00:55:57,308
――它给我们带来财富会一直持续 
in bringing prosperity
will be there

896
00:55:57,308 --> 00:55:59,428
除非人们有共同的诉求
这套制度才能良好运转
unless there is a collective
commitment to keep the system going,

897
00:55:59,429 --> 00:56:01,390
这就需要人们秉持
and that does require people to believe

898
00:56:01,390 --> 00:56:03,547
人人受益的原则
that everyone will benefit in the end.

899
00:56:03,549 --> 00:56:07,547
我认为 资本主义某些丑陋的一面
I think some of the ugliness
of capitalism

900
00:56:07,549 --> 00:56:10,467
如马克思在19世纪看到的那些
that he saw in the 19th century

901
00:56:10,469 --> 00:56:14,547
似乎在20 21世纪重演了
seems to be appearing
in the 20th and 21st,

902
00:56:14,549 --> 00:56:20,109
我们必须提请这方面的关注
and in a way we have to keep
our perspective on this.

903
00:56:20,109 --> 00:56:22,388
人们的健康是比以前好了
The health conditions are much better,

904
00:56:22,390 --> 00:56:26,027
生活条件也更好了
living standards are starting
from a higher level,

905
00:56:26,031 --> 00:56:30,149
但问题是
but it is still the case that

906
00:56:30,149 --> 00:56:34,027
情况离理想状态还很远
things aren't the way they ought to be.

907
00:56:34,031 --> 00:56:37,228
并没有朝正确的方向迈进
And they're not moving
in the way they should be.

908
00:56:38,788 --> 00:56:42,908
让我们面对现实 
马克思并不只是个补锅匠
But let's face it, Marx wasn't just
talking about tweaking the system.

909
00:56:42,909 --> 00:56:47,109
他有更远大的抱负
He had a much grander claim
than that.

910
00:56:47,109 --> 00:56:50,027
马克思改变了世界吗
那当然
Did Marx change the world?
Of course he did.

911
00:56:50,031 --> 00:56:51,507
在他葬礼过后
And after that funeral,

912
00:56:51,509 --> 00:56:53,868
然们在他的墓前撒下热泪
people did weep hot tears
at his grave,

913
00:56:53,870 --> 00:56:57,428
正如17岁的他曾梦想见到的那样
just as his 17-year-old self
would have wanted.

914
00:56:57,429 --> 00:56:59,748
也许有更多人想诅咒他
Probably many more
lived to curse his name.

915
00:56:59,748 --> 00:57:03,308
但无可置疑的是 资本主义还在
But there's no getting round it,
capitalism's still here.

916
00:57:06,831 --> 00:57:11,308
马克思正确地洞察到资本主义
与生俱来的不稳定性
Marx was right to see capitalism
as inherently unstable

917
00:57:11,308 --> 00:57:13,748
以及经常的不公平现象
and often unfair.

918
00:57:13,748 --> 00:57:18,308
凯恩斯和哈耶克也看到了这点
但马克思走的最远
Keynes and Hayek saw that too,
but Marx was the first

919
00:57:18,308 --> 00:57:23,188
不同于这两位大师
他认为我们应抛弃资本主义制度
and unlike them, he didn't think we
should find a way to live with it.

920
00:57:23,188 --> 00:57:26,828
他说 危机过后
He said capitalism would
bounce back from crises

921
00:57:26,831 --> 00:57:28,228
资本主义会卷土重来
and reinvent itself,

922
00:57:28,228 --> 00:57:31,467
但最终 一个无法抗拒的制度
会取而代之
but in the end a compelling
alternative would appear,

923
00:57:31,469 --> 00:57:33,428
资本主义制度会完全毁灭
and capitalism would collapse.

924
00:57:33,429 --> 00:57:37,109
这套曾经被认为大错特错的观点 
For all that rings true now in Marx,

925
00:57:37,109 --> 00:57:40,308
如今听上去像是真的
on that he seems to have been
dead wrong.

926
00:57:40,308 --> 00:57:43,507
没准马克思真的低估了资本主义
Maybe he did underestimate capitalism.

927
00:57:43,509 --> 00:57:46,308
就像他高估了资本主义的对立面一样
He certainly overestimated
the opposition to it.

928
00:57:46,308 --> 00:57:50,308
但我认为 资本主义真的要重铸自己
I think the system needs
to reinvent itself now, again.

929
00:57:50,308 --> 00:57:52,669
若它真的能走出泥淖
If it can pull that off,

930
00:57:52,669 --> 00:57:56,109
下个世纪 我们或许能忽略一下马克思
we'll be talking even less about
Marx a century from now.

931
00:57:56,109 --> 00:58:00,788
但过去几年的危机
资本主义真得付出良多来为自身证明了
But the last few years have left
capitalism with plenty to prove.

932
00:58:08,748 --> 00:58:11,308
公开大学制作了六部1分钟的动画片
The open University's produced six
one minute animations

933
00:58:11,308 --> 00:58:15,308

to explain some of the key economic
ideas that affect all of us,

934
00:58:15,308 --> 00:58:17,669
如果您想了解什么是“看不见的手”
