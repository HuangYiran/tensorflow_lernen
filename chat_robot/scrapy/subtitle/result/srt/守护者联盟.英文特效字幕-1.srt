00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,480

107
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I've got a serious situation with some eggs.

108
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Man in Moon!

109
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sandy, why didn't you say something?

110
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's been a long time, old friend.

111
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is big news?

112
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is Pitch.

113
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Manny, what must we do?

114
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guys, you know what this means?

115
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's choosing a new Guardian.

116
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? Why?

117
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Must be big deal.

118
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Manny thinks we need help.

119
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Since when do we need help?

120
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wonder who it's gonna be!

121
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,850


122
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe the Leprechaun?

123
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please not the Groundhog, please not the Groundhog.

124
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack Frost.

125
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I take it back. The Groundhog's fine.

126
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As long as he helps to protect the children.

127
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right?

128
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack Frost? He doesn't care about children!

129
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right? All he does is freeze water pipes

130
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and mess with my egg hunts!

131
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right? He's an irresponsible, selfish...

132
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:29,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guardian.

133
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack Frost is many things,

134
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but he is not a Guardian.

135
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now that, that was fun.

136
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:01,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wind!

137
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take me home.

138
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Snow day!

139
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's freezing!

140
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,030


141
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:41,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That looks interesting. Good book?

142
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-All right! -Yeah!

143
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Snow day! -Snow day! Yeah.

144
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're welcome.

145
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:47,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guys, wait up!

146
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you guys coming to the egg hunt Sunday?

147
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah! Free candy.

148
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hope we can find the eggs with all this snow!

149
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It says here that

150
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they found Bigfoot hair samples

151
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:00,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and DNA in Michigan!

152
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's like super-close!

153
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here we go again.

154
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You saw the video too, Claude.

155
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:05,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's out there.

156
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what you said about aliens.

157
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the Easter Bunny!

158
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Easter Bunny is real.

159
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's real all right.

160
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:14,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Real annoying,

161
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:15,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}real grumpy and really full of himself.

162
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on! You guys will believe anything.

163
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Easter Bunny, hop, hop, hop!

164
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom, Sophie fell again!

165
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You okay, Soph?

166
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jamie, hat.

167
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:26,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't want Jack Frost nipping at your nose.

168
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's Jack Frost?

169
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No one, honey. It's just an expression.

170
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:34,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Who's Jack Frost?"

171
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, who threw that?

172
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, it wasn't Bigfoot, kiddo.

173
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jamie Bennett, no fair!

174
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You struck first!

175
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Free-for-all!

176
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, who needs ammo?

177
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at that!

178
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Crud! I hit Cupcake!

179
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-She hit Cupcake. -You hit Cupcake?

180
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Did you throw that? -No.

181
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It wasn't me!

182
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A little slippery!

183
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jamie, watch out!

184
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-That's the street! -Stop! There's traffic!

185
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry, Jamie. I got you. Hold on!

186
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's gonna be all right!

187
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keep up with me, kid! Take a left!

188
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:49,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Slow down!

189
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold up. No, no, no, no.

190
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that Jamie Bennett?

191
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-There you go. -No, no!

192
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-My gosh! -Yeah!

193
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That looks serious.

194
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:19,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jamie, are you all right?

195
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you guys see that? It was amazing!

196
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I did a jump

197
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:26,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I slid under a...

198
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cool! A tooth!

199
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Dude, that means cash! -Tooth fairy cash!

200
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Oh, no! -You lucky bum!

201
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got to put this under my pillow!

202
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait a minute. Come on. Hold on, hold on.

203
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about all the fun we just had?

204
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That wasn't the Tooth Fairy, that was me!

205
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My ears are freezing!

206
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's a guy got to do to get a little attention around here?

207
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There was a patch of ice.

208
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:54,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't understand how it got here.

209
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, Easter is around the corner!

210
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...It was awesome!

211
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:00,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So then I was flying down this hill

212
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and it was like... through these cars

213
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and then the sled hit this thing

214
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:06,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and it was like way up in the air!

215
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then, bam, the sofa hit me...

216
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...And see, my tooth came out!

217
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, you. Tooth under your pillow?

218
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I'm ready.

219
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now don't stay up trying to see her, Jamie,

220
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or she won't come.

221
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I can do it this time! You want to help me, Soph?

222
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can hide and see the Tooth Fairy!

223
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hide, hide, hide, hide.

224
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Straight to bed now, mister.

225
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom.

226
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If there's something I'm doing wrong,

227
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:46,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}can you just tell me what it is?

228
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because I've tried everything

229
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:53,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and no one ever sees me.

230
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You put me here.

231
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:01,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The least you can do is tell me...

232
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell me why.

233
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right on time, Sandman.

234
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:11,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought I heard the clippity-clop of a unicorn.

235
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:14,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What an adorable dream!

236
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And look at her.

237
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Precious child.

238
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So sweet.

239
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So full of hope and wonder.

240
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why, there's only one thing missing.

241
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A touch of fear.

242
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That never gets old.

243
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:40,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Feel your fear. Come on. Come on, that's right.

244
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:45,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, what a pretty little Nightmare!

245
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now,

246
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want you to go tell the others the wait is over.

247
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't look at me like that, old friend.

248
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:05,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You must have known this day would come.

249
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:07,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My Nightmares are finally ready.

250
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are your Guardians?

251
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:41,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello, mate.

252
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:44,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Been a long time.

253
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Blizzard of '68 I believe.

254
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Easter Sunday, wasn't it?

255
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bunny! You're not still mad about that, are you?

256
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

257
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But this is about something else.

258
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fellas?

259
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Put me down! What the...

260
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Me?

261
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:14,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not on your nelly. See you back at the Pole.

262
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:28,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's here.

263
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Quiet.

264
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There he is!

265
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack Frost!

266
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:38,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got to be kidding me.

267
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,510


268
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Put me down. -I hope the yetis treated you well.

269
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love being shoved in a sack and tossed through a magic portal.

270
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:50,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, good. That was my idea!

271
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know Bunny, obviously.

272
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Obviously. -And the Tooth Fairy.

273
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello, Jack. I've heard a lot about you.

274
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:56,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And your teeth!

275
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My what?

276
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Open up! Are they really as white as they say?

277
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:00,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes!

278
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They really do sparkle like freshly fallen snow!

279
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Girls, pull yourselves together!

280
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:07,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's not disgrace the uniform.

281
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And Sandman.

282
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:10,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sandy?

283
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:12,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sandy? Wake up!

284
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anyone want to tell me why I'm here?

285
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not really helping,

286
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but thanks, little man.

287
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I must've done something really bad

288
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to get you four together.

289
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Am I on the naughty list?

290
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:30,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}On naughty list?

291
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You hold the record.

292
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:33,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, no matter. We overlook.

293
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now we are wiping clean the slate.

294
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How come?

295
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good question.

296
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How come? I tell you how come!

297
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:42,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because now

298
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you are Guardian!

299
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing? Get off of me!

300
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:55,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the best part!

301
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:27,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What makes you think I want to be a Guardian?

302
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course you do.

303
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:37,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Music!

304
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No music!

305
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is all very flattering, but,

306
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you don't want me.

307
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're all hard work and deadlines,

308
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:50,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I'm snowballs and fun times.

309
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not a Guardian.

310
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. That's exactly what I said.

311
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:57,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack, I don't think you understand what it is we do.

312
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:59,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Each of those lights is a child.

313
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A child who believes.

314
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:05,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And good or bad, naughty or nice,

315
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we protect them.

316
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tooth! Fingers out of mouth.

317
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry. They're beautiful.

318
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. No more wishy-washy.

319
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pitch is out there doing who knows what!

320
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You mean the Boogeyman?

321
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:21,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes! When Pitch threatens us,

322
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he threatens them as well.

323
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All the more reason to pick someone more qualified.

324
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pick? You think we pick?

325
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:30,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, you were chosen! Like we were all chosen.

326
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:32,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}By Man in Moon.

327
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

328
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Last night, Jack, he chose you.

329
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe.

330
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:40,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Man in the Moon... He talks to you?

331
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:44,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see, you cannot say no.

332
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is destiny.

333
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But why wouldn't he tell me that himself?

334
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After 300 years this is his answer?

335
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:57,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To spend eternity like you guys,

336
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:01,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}cooped up in some hideout thinking of new ways to bribe kids?

337
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:06,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no. That's not for me! No offense.

338
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How is that not offensive?

339
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what I think?

340
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:12,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think we just dodged a bullet.

341
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, what's this clown

342
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:16,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}know about bringing joy to children anyway.

343
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You ever hear of a snow day?

344
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:20,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know it's no hard-boiled egg,

345
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but kids like what I do.

346
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But none of them believe in you, do they?

347
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see, you're invisible, mate.

348
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:28,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's like you don't even exist.

349
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bunny! Enough.

350
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, the kangaroo's right.

351
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The what? What did you call me?

352
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not a kangaroo, mate.

353
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, and this whole time I thought you were.

354
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:41,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you're not a kangaroo, what are you?

355
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm a bunny. The Easter Bunny.

356
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}People believe in me.

357
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:57,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack. Walk with me.

358
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's nothing personal, North.

359
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:02,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But what you all do, it's just not my thing.

360
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Man in Moon says it is your thing!

361
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We will see.

362
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:07,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Slow down, would you? I've been trying to bust in here for years.

363
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I want a good look. -What do you mean, bust in?

364
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:12,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry. I never got past the yetis.

365
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Phil.

366
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keep up, Jack, keep up!

367
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I always thought the elves made the toys.

368
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:30,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We just let them believe that.

369
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:36,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Very nice! Keep up good work.

370
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't like it! Paint it red!

371
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Step it up, everybody!

372
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fruitcake?

373
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:04,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, thanks.

374
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now we get down to tacks of brass.

375
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tacks of...

376
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:15,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who are you, Jack Frost?

377
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:18,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What is your center? -My center?

378
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:21,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If Man in Moon chose you to be a Guardian,

379
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you must have something very special inside.

380
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here.

381
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:34,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is how you see me, no?

382
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:37,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Very big, intimidating.

383
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:40,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But if you get to know me a little...

384
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:41,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, go on.

385
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:47,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are downright jolly?

386
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:50,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But not just jolly!

387
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am also mysterious,

388
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and fearless,

389
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and caring!

390
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:02,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And at my center?

391
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:07,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a tiny wooden baby.

392
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look closer. What do you see?

393
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have big eyes.

394
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:15,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes! Big eyes. Very big.

395
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:18,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because they are full of wonder.

396
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is my center.

397
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is what I was born with.

398
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:28,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eyes that have always seen the wonder in everything!

399
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eyes that see lights in the trees and magic in the air.

400
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:38,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This wonder is what I put into the world!

401
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:41,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And what I protect in children.

402
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:43,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is what makes me a Guardian.

403
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is my center.

404
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is yours?

405
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know.

406
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have a problem, mate.

407
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:04,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Trouble at the Tooth Palace.

408
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}North! North!

409
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:09,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told you I'm not going with you guys!

410
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:12,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There is no way I'm climbing into some rickety old...

411
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...Sleigh?

412
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. One ride, but that's it.

413
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everyone loves the sleigh!

414
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:46,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bunny, what are you waiting for?

415
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:50,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think my tunnels might be faster, mate, and safer.

416
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:51,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get in!

417
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buckle up!

418
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are the bloody seatbelts?

419
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:58,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was just expression. Are we ready?

420
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:00,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good. Let's go! Clear!

421
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:07,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Out of the way!

422
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:18,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no!

423
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Slow down! Slow down!

424
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hope you like the loopty-loops.

425
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hope you like carrots.

426
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:35,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here we go!

427
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Blastoff!

428
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:57,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bunny.

429
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:00,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Check out this view.

430
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:02,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}North! He's...

431
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You do care.

432
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:09,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rack off, you bloody show pony!

433
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold on, everyone! I know a shortcut.

434
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Strewth, I knew I should've taken the tunnels.

435
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I say Tooth Palace.

436
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

437
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are they?

438
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're taking the tooth fairies!

439
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:48,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Little Baby Tooth, you okay?

440
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:05,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here, take over.

441
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're stealing the teeth!

442
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack, look out!

443
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tooth! Are you all right?

444
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:29,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They... They took my fairies.

445
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:31,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the teeth! All of them!

446
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:33,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everything is gone.

447
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everything.

448
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:42,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, thank goodness. One of you is all right.

449
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have to say, this is very, very exciting.

450
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Big Four, all in one place.

451
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:52,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm a little starstruck.

452
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:55,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you like my show on the Globe, North?

453
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Got you all together, didn't I?

454
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:01,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pitch! You have got 30 seconds to return my fairies!

455
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:03,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or what?

456
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:05,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll stick a quarter under my pillow?

457
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are you doing this?

458
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe I want what you have.

459
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To be believed in.

460
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:17,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe I'm tired of hiding under beds!

461
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe that's where you belong!

462
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go suck an egg, rabbit.

463
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:26,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hang on. Is that Jack Frost?

464
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Since when are you all so chummy?

465
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:32,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're not.

466
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good. A neutral party.

467
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:37,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then I'm going to ignore you.

468
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:39,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you must be used to that by now.

469
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pitch, you shadow-sneaking ratbag, come here!

470
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey! Easy, girl, easy.

471
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:57,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look familiar, Sandman?

472
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Took me a while to perfect this little trick.

473
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:02,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Turning dreams into Nightmares.

474
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't be nervous.

475
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It only riles them up more. They smell fear, you know.

476
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:12,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What fear? Of you?

477
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:15,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No one's been afraid of you since the Dark Ages!

478
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Dark Ages.

479
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:20,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everyone frightened. Miserable.

480
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Such happy times for me.

481
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The power I wielded.

482
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But then the Man in the Moon

483
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:32,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}chose you to replace my fear with your wonder and light.

484
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:37,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lifting their hearts and giving them hope.

485
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:41,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Meanwhile, everyone wrote me off as just a bad dream!

486
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:42,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"There's nothing to be afraid of.

487
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:45,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no such thing as the Boogeyman!"

488
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:49,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, that's all about to change.

489
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look.

490
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's happening already.

491
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:57,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is?

492
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:03,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Children are waking up and realizing

493
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:05,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the Tooth Fairy never came.

494
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, such a little thing. But to a child...

495
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's going on?

496
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They... They don't believe in me anymore.

497
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:18,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Didn't they tell you, Jack?

498
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:21,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's great being a Guardian.

499
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:22,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But there's a catch.

500
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:25,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If enough kids stop believing,

501
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:26,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}everything your friends protect,

502
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:30,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}wonder, hopes and dreams, it all goes away.

503
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:33,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And little by little, so do they.

504
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No Christmas or Easter,

505
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:40,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or little fairies that come in the night.

506
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:45,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There will be nothing but fear and darkness.

507
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And me.

508
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:51,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's your turn not to be believed in.

509
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's gone.

510
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:18,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, all right, I admit it.

511
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:20,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were right about Pitch.

512
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry about the fairies.

513
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:26,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should have seen them. They put up such a fight.

514
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:30,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why would Pitch take the teeth?

515
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not the teeth he wanted.

516
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the memories inside them.

517
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you mean?

518
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's why we collect the teeth, Jack.

519
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:43,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They hold the most important memories of childhood.

520
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:47,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My fairies and I watch over them.

521
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And when someone needs to remember what's important,

522
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we help them.

523
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We had everyone's here.

524
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:58,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yours, too.

525
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My memories?

526
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}From when you were young.

527
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:05,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Before you became Jack Frost.

528
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I wasn't anyone before I was Jack Frost.

529
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course you were.

530
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:13,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We were all someone before we were chosen.

531
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

532
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should have seen Bunny.

533
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told you never to mention that!

534
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:22,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The night at the pond, I just... I assumed...

535
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:24,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you saying...

536
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you saying I had a life before that,

537
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with a home and a family?

538
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You really don't remember?

539
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:37,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All these years, the answers were right here.

540
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I find my memories,

541
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then I'll know why I'm here.

542
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have to show me!

543
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't, Jack. Pitch has them.

544
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then we have to get them back!

545
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no.

546
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The children!

547
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:54,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're too late!

548
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:57,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! No!

549
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No such thing as too late!

550
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait, wait, wait, wait!

551
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Idea!

552
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:10,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We will collect the teeth.

553
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

554
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:14,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We get teeth, children keep believing in you!

555
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're talking seven continents and millions of kids!

556
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:18,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give me break.

557
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:20,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know how many toys I deliver in one night?

558
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:23,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And eggs I hide in one day?

559
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:26,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, Jack, if you help us,

560
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we will get you your memories.

561
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:38,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm in.

562
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:42,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Quickly! Quickly!

563
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:45,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hop to it, rabbit! I'm five teeth ahead!

564
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, right. Look, I'd tell you to stay out of my way,

565
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:48,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but, really, what's the point?

566
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}'Cause you won't be able to keep up anyway.

567
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:51,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that a challenge, cottontail?

568
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't want to race a rabbit, mate.

569
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A race? Is it a race?

570
00:36:57,670 --> 00:37:00,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is going to be epic!

571
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:01,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Four bicuspids over there!

572
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:02,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}An incisor two blocks east.

573
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that a molar? They're everywhere!

574
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You okay?

575
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:08,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm fine. Sorry.

576
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:11,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's been a really long time since I've been out in the field.

577
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How long is a long time?

578
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}440 years, give or take.

579
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Twins!

580
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:29,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jackpot!

581
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Looks like you're a bit of a brumby,mate?

582
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is piece of pie.

583
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:42,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's my tooth! Sandy! Sandy!

584
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take it easy there, champ.

585
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's one of us! Part of the European division.

586
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Crikey!

587
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:10,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes!

588
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

589
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow! You guys collect teeth and leave gifts

590
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}as fast as my fairies.

591
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You guys have been leaving gifts, right?

592
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The lights.

593
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why aren't they going out?

594
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're collecting the teeth?

595
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pipe down or I'll stuff a pillow with you!

596
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fine. Have your last hurrah.

597
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:28,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For tomorrow,

598
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}all your pathetic scrambling will be for nothing.

599
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Left central incisor,

600
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:37,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}knocked out in a freak sledding accident.

601
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:40,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wonder how that could've happened, Jack.

602
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:43,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kids?

603
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:49,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This was always the part I liked most.

604
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Seeing the kids.

605
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:00,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why did I ever stop doing this?

606
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:04,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a little different up close, huh?

607
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks for being here, Jack.

608
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wish I'd known about your memory.

609
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:12,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I could have helped you.

610
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah...

611
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:15,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, let's just get you taken care of.

612
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:17,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then it's Pitch's turn.

613
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here you are!

614
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What gives, slowpokes?

615
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How you feeling, Toothy?

616
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:30,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Believed in.

617
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:32,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what I want to hear.

618
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I see how it is. All working together

619
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to make sure the rabbit gets last place.

620
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:41,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think I need help to beat a bunny?

621
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Check it out, Peter Cottontail.

622
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You call that a bag of choppers?

623
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now that's a bag of choppers.

624
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gentlemen, gentlemen. This is about Tooth.

625
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not a competition.

626
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:53,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But if it was, I win!

627
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:57,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no.

628
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Santa Claus?

629
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Easter Bunny?

630
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:04,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sandman?

631
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:06,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Tooth Fairy! I knew you'd come!

632
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:09,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Surprise! We came.

633
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He can see us?

634
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:14,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Most of us.

635
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:22,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You guys, he's still awake.

636
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:23,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sandy, knock him out.

637
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With the Dreamsand, you gumbies!

638
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, stop! That's the Easter Bunny!

639
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing, Abbey? Down!

640
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, nobody panic.

641
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But that's a greyhound.

642
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you know what greyhounds do to rabbits?

643
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:41,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think it's a pretty safe bet he's never met a rabbit like me.

644
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Six-foot-one,

645
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}nerves of steel.

646
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Master of tai-chi and the ancient art of...

647
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:50,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop! Sit!

648
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Down, girl, down!

649
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:55,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sandy!

650
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:02,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's rabid! Get this dingo off me!

651
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:04,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no.

652
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Candy canes...

653
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:22,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I really wish I had a camera right now.

654
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sandy, come on! We can find Pitch!

655
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:49,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pretty.

656
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:52,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bunny, hop, hop, hop!

657
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What...

658
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:13,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes!

659
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got it.

660
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sandy!

661
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:43,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sandy, did you see that?

662
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:46,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at this thing.

663
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Frost?

664
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, for a neutral party,

665
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:56,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you spend an awful lot of time with those weirdos.

666
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This isn't your fight, Jack.

667
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You made it my fight when you stole those teeth!

668
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Teeth? Why do you care about the teeth?

669
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:09,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now this is who I'm looking for.

670
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:29,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remind me not to get on your bad side.

671
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:32,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, easy. You can't blame me for trying, Sandy.

672
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:36,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't know what it's like to be weak and hated.

673
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:39,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was stupid of me to mess with your dreams.

674
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:41,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, I'll tell you what.

675
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:43,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can have them back.

676
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:58,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You take the ones on the left,

677
00:44:58,230 --> 00:44:59,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll take the ones on the right?

678
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on!

679
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:58,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You might want to duck.

680
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:13,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've got to help Sandy!

681
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

682
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:22,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack!

683
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:26,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't fight the fear, little man!

684
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:31,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hurry! Hurry, Jack!

685
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd say "Sweet dreams,"

686
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But there aren't any left.

687
00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:48,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sandy?

688
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:50,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

689
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack!

690
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:25,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack, how did you do that?

691
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:28,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't know I could.

692
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:40,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Finally!

693
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:43,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Someone who knows how to have a little fun!

694
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:44,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you all right?

695
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:45,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just...

696
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wish I could've done something.

697
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:49,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Done something?

698
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:52,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack, you stood up to Pitch.

699
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:52,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You saved us!

700
00:48:53,050 --> 00:48:54,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But Sandy...

701
00:48:54,350 --> 00:48:56,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Would be proud of what you did.

702
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:03,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know who you were in your past life.

703
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:06,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But in this life, you are Guardian.

704
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:11,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But how can I know who I am until I find out who I was?

705
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You will.

706
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:15,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I feel it

707
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in my belly.

708
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:22,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look how fast they're going out.

709
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's fear.

710
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:27,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's tipped the balance.

711
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:32,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, buck up, you sad sacks!

712
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:36,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can still turn this around!

713
00:49:36,970 --> 00:49:39,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Easter is tomorrow.

714
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:40,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I need your help.

715
00:49:40,990 --> 00:49:43,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I say we pull out all the stops

716
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and we get those little lights flickering again.

717
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:51,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bunny is right.

718
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As much as it pains me to say, old friend,

719
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:57,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}this time, Easter is more important than Christmas.

720
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, did everyone hear that?

721
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We must hurry to the warren.

722
00:50:01,310 --> 00:50:02,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everyone! To the sleigh!

723
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:05,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, mate. My warren, my rules.

724
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:06,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buckle up.

725
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:08,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shostakovich!

726
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:21,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Buckle up." Is very funny.

727
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Welcome to the warren.

728
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:30,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something's up.

729
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sophie?

730
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:56,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Elf, elf, elf! -What is she doing here?

731
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Snow globe.

732
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:00,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Somebody do something.

733
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:02,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't look at me. I'm invisible, remember?

734
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:03,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Elf! Elf!

735
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:06,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry, Bunny. I bet she's a fairy fan.

736
00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:08,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-It's okay, little one. -Pretty.

737
00:51:09,190 --> 00:51:11,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what? I've got something for you!

738
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:13,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here it is!

739
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at all the pretty teeth,

740
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with little blood and gum on them!

741
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:22,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Blood and gums?

742
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When was the last time

743
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:25,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you guys actually hung out with kids?

744
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:26,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Peek-a-boo!

745
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are very busy bringing joy to children.

746
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't have time...

747
00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:34,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For children.

748
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:38,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If one little kid can ruin Easter,

749
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:41,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then we're in worse shape than I thought.

750
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:52,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want to paint some eggs? Yeah?

751
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:54,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Okay. -Come on.

752
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:01,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rimsky-Korsakov!

753
00:52:01,570 --> 00:52:02,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a lot of eggs.

754
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How much time do we have?

755
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:12,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, troops, it's time to push back.

756
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That means eggs everywhere!

757
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:17,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Heaps of you in every high-rise,

758
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:20,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}farmhouse, and trailer park!

759
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In tennis shoes and cereal bowls.

760
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:26,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, there will be bathtubs filled with my beautiful googies!

761
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:37,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, that's a little strange.

762
00:52:37,570 --> 00:52:38,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, mate.

763
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:40,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's adorable.

764
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:46,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There will be springtime! On every continent!

765
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:49,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I'm bringing hope with me!

766
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:00,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Too Christmas-y, mate. Paint them blue.

767
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:05,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's over there?

768
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:08,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a beauty!

769
00:53:09,230 --> 00:53:11,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, all we got to do is get him and his little mates

770
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}through the tunnels to the top

771
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:16,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and we'll have ourselves Easter.

772
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:28,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not bad.

773
00:53:31,290 --> 00:53:33,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not bad yourself.

774
00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:38,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, I'm sorry about the whole...

775
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, the kangaroo thing.

776
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:42,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the accent, isn't it?

777
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:47,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Poor little ankle-biter. Look at her. All tuckered out.

778
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:49,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love her.

779
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:53,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think it's time to get her home.

780
00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:54,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How about I take her home?

781
00:53:54,810 --> 00:53:56,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack, no. Pitch is...

782
00:53:56,370 --> 00:53:57,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No match for this.

783
00:53:57,730 --> 00:54:00,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Which is why we need you here with us.

784
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:03,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Trust me. I'll be quick as a bunny.

785
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sophie? Is that you?

786
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:28,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We should get back.

787
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:31,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack!

788
00:54:33,730 --> 00:54:35,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That voice, I know that voice.

789
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:53,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack!

790
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:03,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry, there's still time.

791
00:55:16,310 --> 00:55:17,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack?

792
00:55:27,110 --> 00:55:28,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Baby Tooth, come on!

793
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have to find out what that is.

794
00:55:45,170 --> 00:55:46,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keep it down!

795
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:47,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna get you out of here just as soon as...

796
00:55:48,050 --> 00:55:49,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack?

797
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:52,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack!

798
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:54,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...As I can.

799
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:02,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Looking for something?

800
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:10,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't be afraid, Jack. I'm not gonna hurt you.

801
00:56:11,450 --> 00:56:14,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Afraid? I'm not afraid of you.

802
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:16,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe not. But you are afraid of something.

803
00:56:17,410 --> 00:56:19,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You think so, huh? -I know so!

804
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:23,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the one thing I always know.

805
00:56:23,090 --> 00:56:25,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}People's greatest fears.

806
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:28,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yours is that no one will ever believe in you.

807
00:56:32,930 --> 00:56:34,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And worst of all,

808
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:36,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you're afraid you'll never know why.

809
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:38,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why you?

810
00:56:39,310 --> 00:56:42,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why were you chosen to be like this?

811
00:56:43,110 --> 00:56:44,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fear not.

812
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:47,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For the answer to that is right here.

813
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:53,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you want them, Jack? Your memories?

814
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:06,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everything you wanted to know, in this little box.

815
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:11,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why did you end up like this? Unseen.

816
00:57:11,550 --> 00:57:13,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Unable to reach out to anyone.

817
00:57:13,970 --> 00:57:15,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want the answers so badly.

818
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:18,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want to grab them and fly off with them.

819
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:22,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you're afraid of what the Guardians will think.

820
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're afraid of disappointing them.

821
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:26,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me ease your mind about one thing.

822
00:57:26,690 --> 00:57:29,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They'll never accept you. Not really.

823
00:57:29,150 --> 00:57:31,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop it! Stop it!

824
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After all, you're not one of them.

825
00:57:34,370 --> 00:57:35,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't know what I am.

826
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:38,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course I do! You're Jack Frost.

827
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:40,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You make a mess wherever you go.

828
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why, you're doing it right now.

829
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:45,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did you do?

830
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:48,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}More to the point, Jack, what did you do?

831
00:57:57,220 --> 00:57:58,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Baby Tooth!

832
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:01,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Happy Easter, Jack.

833
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:07,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

834
00:58:08,070 --> 00:58:09,440


835
00:58:08,070 --> 00:58:09,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There aren't any eggs.

836
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:11,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-There's nothing here. -I give up.

837
00:58:11,110 --> 00:58:13,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-He didn't come. -I don't understand.

838
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:15,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe he just hid them really well this year.

839
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:17,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Kids! -I checked everywhere.

840
00:58:17,330 --> 00:58:17,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's nothing.

841
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:19,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, there is! There is!

842
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:21,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, these aren't my best looking googies,

843
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:22,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but they'll do in a pinch.

844
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:23,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't believe it.

845
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:25,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know.

846
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:28,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no such thing as the Easter Bunny.

847
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:29,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? No.

848
00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:31,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wrong! Not true!

849
00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:33,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm right in front of you, mate.

850
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:33,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why wouldn't he come?

851
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:40,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They don't see me.

852
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:47,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack, where were you?

853
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:50,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Nightmares attacked the tunnels.

854
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:54,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They smashed every egg, crushed every basket.

855
00:58:54,570 --> 00:58:56,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing made it to the surface.

856
00:58:57,570 --> 00:58:58,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack.

857
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:02,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where did you get that?

858
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:04,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was... Lt's...

859
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:05,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's Baby Tooth?

860
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:10,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack, what have you done?

861
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:13,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is why you weren't here?

862
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:15,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were with Pitch?

863
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:17,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, listen, listen.

864
00:59:18,390 --> 00:59:21,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry. I didn't mean for this to happen.

865
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:23,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-He has to go. -What?

866
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:25,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We should never have trusted you!

867
00:59:29,310 --> 00:59:33,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Easter is new beginnings, new life.

868
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:36,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Easter's about hope.

869
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And now it's gone.

870
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:13,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's check the park again.

871
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Really? -For what? The Easter Bunny?

872
01:00:15,650 --> 01:00:17,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guys, I told you, I saw him!

873
01:00:17,650 --> 01:00:18,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's way bigger than I thought

874
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:20,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and he's got these cool boomerang things!

875
01:00:20,990 --> 01:00:22,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grow up, Jamie.

876
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:23,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, man. Seriously?

877
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:29,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's happened to you guys?

878
01:00:30,330 --> 01:00:31,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was a dream!

879
01:00:31,630 --> 01:00:33,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should be happy you still get dreams like that

880
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:35,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and not...

881
01:00:36,590 --> 01:00:38,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nightmares.

882
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:42,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Forget it, Jamie.

883
01:00:44,470 --> 01:00:46,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's just no Easter this year.

884
01:00:47,230 --> 01:00:49,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He really is real!

885
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:52,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know he is.

886
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:22,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought this might happen.

887
01:01:23,090 --> 01:01:25,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They never really believed in you.

888
01:01:25,430 --> 01:01:27,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was just trying to show you that.

889
01:01:27,890 --> 01:01:29,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I understand.

890
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:33,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't understand anything!

891
01:01:33,730 --> 01:01:37,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No? I don't know what it's like to be cast out?

892
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:43,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To not be believed in?

893
01:01:44,950 --> 01:01:48,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To long for a family.

894
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:53,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All those years in the shadows I thought

895
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:56,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}no one else knows what this feels like.

896
01:01:57,250 --> 01:01:58,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But now I see I was wrong.

897
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:03,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't have to be alone, Jack.

898
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:08,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I believe in you. And I know children will, too.

899
01:02:08,970 --> 01:02:10,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In me?

900
01:02:10,270 --> 01:02:11,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes!

901
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:14,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at what we can do.

902
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:18,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What goes together better than cold and dark?

903
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can make them believe.

904
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:23,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll give them a world where everything, everything is...

905
01:02:24,110 --> 01:02:25,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pitch black?

906
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:28,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And Jack Frost, too.

907
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:30,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They'll believe in both of us.

908
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, they'll fear both of us.

909
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:34,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that's not what I want.

910
01:02:35,330 --> 01:02:36,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now for the last time,

911
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}leave me alone.

912
01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:44,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Very well. You want to be left alone.

913
01:02:44,370 --> 01:02:45,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Done. But first...

914
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:50,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Baby Tooth!

915
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:53,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The staff, Jack!

916
01:02:55,190 --> 01:02:58,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have a bad habit of interfering.

917
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:02,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, hand it over, and I'll let her go.

918
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:20,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right.

919
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:21,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now let her go.

920
01:03:23,420 --> 01:03:24,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

921
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:28,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You said you wanted to be alone.

922
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:29,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So be alone!

923
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:34,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

924
01:03:58,710 --> 01:04:00,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Baby Tooth!

925
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:02,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You all right?

926
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:09,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry. All I can do is keep you cold.

927
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:14,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pitch was right.

928
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:17,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I make a mess of everything.

929
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:34,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack?

930
01:04:35,620 --> 01:04:41,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack!

931
01:04:59,310 --> 01:05:00,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Jack,

932
01:05:00,650 --> 01:05:02,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you can't have fun all the time.

933
01:05:02,110 --> 01:05:03,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack, get down from there.

934
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:05,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Jack! -You're funny, Jack.

935
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:07,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Be careful.

936
01:05:09,490 --> 01:05:10,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We will.

937
01:05:18,830 --> 01:05:20,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's okay. It's okay.

938

01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:26,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm scared.

941
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:29,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know. I know.

942
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:35,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you're gonna be all right. You're not gonna fall in.

961
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:17,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two.

962

965
01:06:56,090 --> 01:06:57,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was me!

966
01:06:57,350 --> 01:06:59,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I had a family! I had a sister!

967
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:01,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I saved her!

968
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:06,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's why you chose me.

969
01:07:08,610 --> 01:07:10,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm a Guardian.

970
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:17,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have to get out of here.

971
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:28,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:57,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's wrong?

975
01:08:00,490 --> 01:08:01,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}None of you can fly?

976
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The lights.

977
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:19,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're all free to go!

978
01:08:19,510 --> 01:08:22,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We won't be needing any Christmas toys this year,

979

01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:25,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nor ever again.

981
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:33,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're all going out.

982
01:08:34,030 --> 01:08:35,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Only six left.

983
01:08:35,650 --> 01:08:37,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Six precious children

984
01:08:37,610 --> 01:08:41,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}who still believe in the Guardians with all their hearts.

985
01:08:41,870 --> 01:08:43,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Make that

986

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Four.

988

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One.

991

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you and I are obviously at what they call a crossroads.

994
01:09:18,860 --> 01:09:20,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So here's what's gonna happen.

995
01:09:21,660 --> 01:09:25,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If it wasn't a dream and if you are real

996
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:29,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then you have to prove it, like, right now.

997
01:09:38,590 --> 01:09:41,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've believed in you for a long time, okay?

998

01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:46,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you kind of owe me now.

1000
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:48,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't have to do much.

1001
01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:50,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just a little sign so I know.

1002
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:54,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anything.

1003
01:09:55,110 --> 01:09:56,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anything at all.

1004
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:04,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I knew it.

1005
01:10:36,310 --> 01:10:37,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's real!

1006
01:10:57,250 --> 01:10:58,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Snow?

1007
01:11:06,890 --> 01:11:09,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack Frost.

1008
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:11,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did he just say...

1009
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:13,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack Frost?

1010
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:16,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He said it again. He said...

1011

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You said...

1012
01:11:19,820 --> 01:11:21,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack Frost!

1013
01:11:21,690 --> 01:11:23,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's right!

1014
01:11:23,110 --> 01:11:26,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But that's me! Jack Frost! That's my name!

1015
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:28,950

1016
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:34,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait. Can you hear me?

1017
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:39,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you... Can you see me?

1018

01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:03,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But what about the Easter Bunny? And the Tooth Fairy?

1027
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:07,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Real, real, real! Every one of us is real.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack, he sees you.

1043
01:13:07,670 --> 01:13:09,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait. But where's Bunny?

1044
01:13:10,010 --> 01:13:13,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Losing Easter took its toll on all of us.

1045
01:13:13,850 --> 01:13:15,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bunny most of all.

1046
01:13:19,810 --> 01:13:21,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

1047
01:13:24,020 --> 01:13:25,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's the Easter Bunny?

1048
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:27,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now somebody sees me!

1049
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:29,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where were you about an hour ago, mate?

1050
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:31,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happened to him?

1051
01:13:31,660 --> 01:13:34,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He used to be huge and cool. And now he's...

1052
01:13:34,950 --> 01:13:36,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cute.

1053
01:13:36,330 --> 01:13:38,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's good.

1054
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:40,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you tell him to say that? That's it!

1055
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go! Me and you! Come on!

1056
01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:45,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Actually, he told me you were real.

1057
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:48,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just when I started to think that maybe you weren't.

1058
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:51,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He made you believe?

1059
01:13:52,180 --> 01:13:53,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In me?

1060
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:10,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get Jamie out of here.

1061
01:14:10,150 --> 01:14:11,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Be careful, Jack.

1062
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:17,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack Frost.

1063
01:14:17,580 --> 01:14:20,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's end this, shall we?

1064
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:26,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That little trick doesn't work on me anymore.

1065
01:14:32,130 --> 01:14:33,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This way, this way.

1066
01:14:34,550 --> 01:14:36,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dead end. Other way, other way!

1067
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:41,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack!

1068
01:14:43,770 --> 01:14:46,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was good try, Jack. "A" For effort.

1069
01:14:46,650 --> 01:14:49,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's stronger. I can't beat him.

1070
01:14:55,370 --> 01:14:57,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All this fuss over one little boy,

1071
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:01,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and still he refuses to stop believing.

1072
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:02,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Very well.

1073
01:15:02,150 --> 01:15:06,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There are other ways to snuff out a light.

1074
01:15:08,210 --> 01:15:10,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you want him, you're gonna have to go through me.

1075
01:15:12,420 --> 01:15:14,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look how fluffy you are.

1076
01:15:14,970 --> 01:15:16,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Would you like a scratch behind the ears?

1077
01:15:17,050 --> 01:15:18,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you even think about it.

1078
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:22,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't tell you how happy it makes me to see you all like this.

1079
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:27,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You look awful.

1080
01:15:34,150 --> 01:15:43,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack. I'm scared.

1081
01:15:43,790 --> 01:15:45,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know, I know.

1082
01:15:46,290 --> 01:15:48,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you're gonna be all right.

1083
01:15:49,790 --> 01:15:53,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're gonna have a little fun instead.

1084
01:15:54,130 --> 01:15:56,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's it! That's my center!

1085
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:02,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So what do you think, Jamie?

1086
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:07,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you believe in the Boogey...

1087
01:16:13,650 --> 01:16:15,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now let's go get your friends.

1088
01:16:29,420 --> 01:16:30,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cool!

1089
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:57,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jamie, how are you doing that?

1090
01:16:57,490 --> 01:16:58,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack Frost!

1091
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:00,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, we need your help!

1092
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:04,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that...

1093
01:17:04,370 --> 01:17:05,950

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Merry Christmas! -Happy Easter!

1095
01:17:13,550 --> 01:17:14,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't forget to floss!

1096
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:18,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Cupcake? -What?

1097
01:17:21,260 --> 01:17:22,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jamie, you were right!

1098
01:17:23,050 --> 01:17:24,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Easter Bunny's real!

1099
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:26,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-The Tooth Fairy! -And Santa!

1100
01:17:26,220 --> 01:17:27,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're all real!

1101
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:45,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think a few children can help you? Against this?

1102
01:17:53,380 --> 01:17:55,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're just bad dreams, Jamie.

1103
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:58,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And we'll protect you, mate.

1104
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:00,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll protect them?

1105
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:04,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But who will protect you?

1106
01:18:12,810 --> 01:18:15,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I will.

1107
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:19,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I will. -I will.

1109
01:18:22,110 --> 01:18:23,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll try.

1110
01:18:28,450 --> 01:18:32,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Still think there's no such thing as the Boogeyman?

1111
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:43,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I do believe in you. I'm just not afraid of you.

01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:21,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wrong roof.

1126

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at that!

1127
01:20:40,340 --> 01:20:41,630

1131
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:48,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no place to hide.

1132

1134
01:21:28,430 --> 01:21:31,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mate, you are a sight for sore eyes.

1135
01:21:55,910 --> 01:21:57,540

1136
01:22:47,050 --> 01:22:48,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your center?

1137
01:22:50,550 --> 01:22:52,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It took a while,

1138
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:53,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I figured it out.

1139
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:08,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're all on naughty list!

1140

1141
01:23:15,450 --> 01:23:16,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

1142
01:23:20,870 --> 01:23:24,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You dare have fun in my presence?

1143
01:23:24,460 --> 01:23:29,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am the Boogeyman and you will fear me!

1144
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:32,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! No.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You didn't even say goodbye.

1147
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:53,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A quarter?

1148
01:23:58,870 --> 01:24:00,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that's for my fairies.

1149
01:24:01,790 --> 01:24:04,660

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There will always be fear.

1151
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:11,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So what? As long as one child believes,

1154
01:24:22,680 --> 01:24:24,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They can't be my Nightmares. I'm not afraid.

1155
01:24:27,650 --> 01:24:30,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Looks like it's your fear they smell.

1156

1160
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:17,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then is time you take Oath.

1161

1184
01:26:53,540 --> 01:26:55,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But what if Pitch comes back?

1185
01:26:55,380 --> 01:26:57,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What if we stop believing again?

1186
01:26:57,420 --> 01:26:58,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I can't see you...

1187
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:01,590

01:27:02,650 --> 01:27:04,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}believing in the moon when the sun comes up?

1190
01:27:04,470 --> 01:27:05,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

1191
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:07,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Do you stop believing in the sun

1192
01:27:07,810 --> 01:27:09,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when clouds block it out?

1193

01:27:18,780 --> 01:27:22,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Which kind of makes you a Guardian, too.

1197

01:28:02,110 --> 01:28:04,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because the moon told me so.

1203
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:07,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So when the moon tells you something,

1204
