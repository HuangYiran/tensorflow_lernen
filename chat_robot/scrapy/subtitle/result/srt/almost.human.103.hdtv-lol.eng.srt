Hey, James.

18
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,000
- Morning, Mr. Navarro.
- How you doing?

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,900
Miss Miller.

20
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,300
Oh. James.

21
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,100
Left your key in the lock again.

22
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,500
Thank you. I swear my memory gets worse every day.

23
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,300
I told you, I can have maintenance come in and switch those out for bio locks if you'd like.

24
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,700
That's all right, I prefer the old-fashioned way.

25
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,400
- I'm funny, I guess.
- No, no, no, I like that.

26
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,500
Uh, this came to the security desk for you.

27
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,400
- Oh, thank you.
- I got to get back to the desk.

28
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,400
See you.

Hi, can I help you?

31
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,900
- What's your name?
- James.

32
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000

36
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,500
You're late and the car smells like olive oil.

37
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,200
Hold this... and this.

38
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,300
What am I doing here?

39
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,700
You're heating my coffee.

40
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,600
I like it hot.

41
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,100
It's best between 155 and 175 degrees.

42
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,300
Most people prefer it at 175.

43
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:17,600
You like it at 165, and that's what it is.

44
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,100
You know how I like my coffee?

45
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:23,100
Yes, I, unlike you, pay attention to details, like what time it is and what time

46
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,000
you're supposed to pick up your partner for shift.

47
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Oh, I pay attention to details, like you just put your finger in my coffee.

48
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,700
If you'd like, I could put it somewhere else.

49
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,900
Wa-Wa-Wait, go back.

50
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,600
- To where?
- To when I didn't have a partner and I could drive to work in peace.

51
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:37,900
I know you took my advice

52
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,100
and used olive oil on your leg, John, and it works.

53
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,800
You're just too stubborn to say thank you, but you're welcome.

54
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,900
I ate a salad... a Greek salad.

55
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,100
At 10:00 a. m.?

56
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,900
Boy, you're some detective.

57
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,400
Finally. Now you're talking.

58
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,400
13 RAY. Possible 31. Homicide.

59
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,900
Body discovered at 4500 Crescent Av.

60
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,200
- That's three blocks away.
- All right, let's go to work.

61
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,300
How long you been here?

62
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,800
We just got here. There were no witnesses to the shooting.

63
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,600
The incident happened within the last 20 minutes.

64
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,500
- Who found him?
- These two, and we've cordoned off the area.

65
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,500
They killed the cameras.

66
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,000
I think I can still access the archived footage.

67
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,400
John...

68
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,400
They went up to the 25th floor.

69
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,100
They shut down the elevator.

70
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,600
Transmit that security footage to Maldonado,

71
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,700
so we can try and I.D. these guys.

72
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,300
Officer Harrison, call for backup and begin evacuation protocols.

73
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,200
- Yes, sir.
- And be careful.

74
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,700
- Perps are still in the building.
- You got it.

75
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,000
What's the plan?

76
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,300
I got no idea...

77
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:31,000
but we got 25 floors to figure it out.

78
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,400
Hand over the phone.

79
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,100
- Shut your mouth.
- Hand it over.

80
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,100
- Stop talking.
- Please don't hurt me.

81
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,800
- Let me see it... hey, hey.
- ??? Let's go.

82
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,000
I told you, you sit down.

83
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,000
Hello.

84
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,700
What's your name?

85
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,000
Oh, you, you don't know how to answer that, do you?

86
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,900
You're afraid if you answer, you'll get hurt, huh?

87
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,500
Well... the only way around that is...

88
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,200
that you answer honestly.

89
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,800
It's always the best policy.

90
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,600
Jenna.

91
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,400
Why don't you come and join me, Jenna?

92
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,500
Yo.

93
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,200
- We can start now.
- Cops are still in the lobby.

94
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,900
Well, that's their fault.

95
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,400
It's time to get their attention.

96
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,000
Out of the way, out of the way.

97
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Stay down.

98
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,100
- Police. Keep moving.
- This is not a drill.

99
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,400
- What's going on?
- Sir, we need you to keep moving, continuing out of the building.

100
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,200
- Go down the stairwell.
- What's going on out there?

101
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,500
- Out of the building, please.
- Take the rest of the day off.

102
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,000
Move to the stairs, exit the back of the building.

103
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,900
- What's the update, Stahl?
- It's the Sanderson building downtown.

104
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,900
John's on the second floor ascending.

105
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,700
Ascending? John!

106
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,800
What's your status?

107
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,600
Dorian says the building is still structurally sound.

108
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,400
There's damage to the third and fourth emergency exits.

109
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,100
The southeast stairwell is also blocked.

110
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,700
Emergency personnel are getting people out by the second story.

111
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,600
John, do not ascend. Negative.

112
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,700
Continue to direct the employees to the second floor

113
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,800
and go there yourself until we know what we're dealing with here.

114
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,100
I know what we're dealing with.

115
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,900
The assailants are still in the building. We're going after them.

116
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,700
Buy me some time. You should initiate the protocol.

117
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,500
Jam all comm signals coming in and out of the building,

118
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,800
cut their communication, and get me some backup.

119
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,300
John, if we jam the signal, comms won't make it out of the building.

120
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,100
We won't be able to communicate.

121
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,100
Leave the building now.

122
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,300
There's... I can't...

123
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,500
What... do...

124
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,000
Do you... Christmas.

125
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,600
Did you just hang up on Captain Maldonado?

126
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,800
Yeah, boring conversation anyway.

127
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,000
I just love that you wear your insubordination like it's a virtue.

128
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:14,900
- Did we evacuate the perimeter?
- Per protocol, three-block radius.

129
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,600
Yeah, this is Paul.

130
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,400
Lock down communications.

131
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,900
- Initiate the jam.
- Sequence initiated.

132
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Okay, signal active. Switching to internal comms.

133
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,300
They jammed us.

134
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,500
All external communications are blocked.

135
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,100
Law enforcement is nothing if not predictable.

136
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,600
Alpha team, take the north side.

137
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,800
Bravo team, take the rooftop.

138
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,500
Hold your fire until instructed.

139
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,700
Clear.

140
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,200
Any more thoughts on that plan? We're running out of floors, John.

141
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,600
Well, I thought backup would be here by now.

142
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,400
Guess we just keep moving up.

143
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,200
Maybe there's another option.

144
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,200
The entire air system is interconnected.

145
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,300
We just have to make it to the 23rd floor.

146
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:25,300
- There's an access door to the air system there that'll take us up to where these guys are.
- See?

147
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,800
Told you we'd come up with a plan.

148
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,500
What's with the disco face? Got something to tell me?

149
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:40,100
Since the signals are now being jammed, every emergency call being placed in this building

150
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,800
(EMERGENCY RESPONSE REQUESTS)
is bouncing back to me because they can't get out.

151
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,700
Answer the calls. We might get some information.

152
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,700
Hello?

153
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:52,600
Thnak God. I need police. I am in my office. There was an explosion.

154
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:58,400
Ma'am, it's okay. I understand. The police are already on their way.

155
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,500
Make your way down to the second floor.

156
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,400
- What are you doing?
- In the Portuguese culture, it is proven

157
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,100
that people find a woman's voice more soothing in moments of crisis.

158
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,500
- Hello?
- Hello.

159
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,700
I'm Detective John Kennex.

160
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,400
I'm an automated police officer with a very difficult personality.

161
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,700
- 911?
- Please remain calm.

162
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,800
I'm-I'm trapped with a gunman. Please help.

163
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,400
Everything's all right. Just take a breath.

164
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,600
What is your name?

165
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,100
It's Paige.

166
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,300
Hi, Paige.

167
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:33,000
- What can you tell me about the gunmen?
- I don't know.

168
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,200
They have my sister...

169
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,300
and others.

170
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,900
Listen, Paige, I'm in the building.

171
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,800
I need to ask you a few questions,

172
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,000
but first I need to know... are you safe?

173
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,600
Are you out of harm's way?

174
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,200
I think so.

175
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,700
- For now.
- Okay, listen to me.

176
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,300
Where are you? What floor are you on?

177
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,600
I'm on the 25th floor.

178
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,800
I'm in the utility closet.

179
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,700
Next face.

180
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,500
You, on your knees.

181
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:06,900
On your knees!

182
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,400
Oh, no, no! Oh, God.

183
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:14,900
Paige?

184
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,200
Paige, what's happening?

185
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,900
They've shot him.

186
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,000
Lou is dead.

187
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,800
Hey, dogface. Water.

188
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,400
We got a body!

189
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,800
(NO COPS STAY OUT)
Keep those people back!

190
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,800
Those bastards. What do they want?

191
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,500
Detective Paul, initiate hostage protocol.

192
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,500
Send them the comm. Send them the comm!

193
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,700
Get that drone in the air. We've got to start negotiating.

194
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,500
Comm's here.

195
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,900
- What's your name?
- Captain Maldonado.

196
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,400
And you are?

197
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,700
Well, I'd tell you, but I don't want to nullify your efforts.

198
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,200
Now that we have your attention...

199
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,700
we have some demands.

200
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,400
Paige, can you hold the phone up so I can hear what's going on?

201
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,800
I really hate to throw out any more hostages.

202
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,900
- Let's get down to brass tacks, huh?
- What do you want?

203
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,900
First, get your snipers off the roof, and tell those men

204
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:11,700
you have assembled out front to stand down, and keep them away from the building,

205
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:15,200
or hostages will continue to fall from the sky.

206
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,800
Tell Detective Paul to have his men stand down.

207
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,800
Bravo team, stand down.

208
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,000
All clear.

209
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,500
Done. What else?

210
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:39,500
We'd like three v-tols on the roof standing by, clear airspace from here to the border,

211
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:44,000
and finally, I'd like one fission igniter delivered to me, please.

212
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,700
That's military-grade technology. I don't have that authority.

213
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,600
Well, then I suggest you contact someone who does.

214
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,300
Facial recognition identified.

215
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,200
(LUCAS VICENT - HOLY RECLAMATION ARMY)

216
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,400
Now, you listen to me, Lucas, if you want me to cooperate with you,

217
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,300
I need you to cooperate with me.

218
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,800
How many hostages do you have?

219
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,700
More than enough to end your career

220
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,000
if they die.

221
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,900
You have 43 minutes.

222
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,800
Set the timer for 43 minutes, and get me Rudy Lom.

223
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,100
Hello? Are you there?

224
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,500
- Right here, Paige.
- Is anyone coming?

225
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,400
You just hang tight. We're gonna be with you real soon.

226
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,400
- Did you hear the phone call?
- Yeah, I did. Thank you.

227
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,900
Just hold on a second. I'll be right back.

228
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,200
Is a fission igniter as bad as I think it is?

229
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,300
It's a trigger mechanism for a large explosive device.

230
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,400
- Megaton level.
- Megaton.

231
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,600
Paige, you there?

232
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,700
Can you tell me how many hostages they've got up there?

233
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,800
25 or so.

234
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,100
At least in this room. It's hard for me to see.

235
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,100
You're doing great, Paige.

236
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:15,900
- How's your sister?
- This is all my fault.

237
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,400
She wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me.

238
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,500
She's visiting from out of town.

239
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,000
She just stopped by to have lunch...

240
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,100
and now she's all alone.

241
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,800
Paige, can you tell me how many gunmen there are?

242
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,500
People keep coming and going; I don't know.

243
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,000
Five... six, at least.

244
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,500
But there were more.

245
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,200
I'm sorry, I can't do this.

246
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,100
I'm so scared.

247
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,100
Paige, you ever been ice fishing?

248
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,700
- No.
- When I was 11 years old,

249
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,000
my dad took me ice fishing to Lake McFarland.

250
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,300
We were coming back, and all of a sudden

251
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,500
the ice cracked, and I went right under.

252
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,300
I couldn't see, I couldn't breathe.

253
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,600
I thought I was gonna die.

254
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:15,200
The water was so cold, it was like thousands of needles

255
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,300
stinging every part of my body.

256
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,700
And then my dad jumped in,

257
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,400
and he grabbed me and started dragging me back to shore.

258
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,200
Are you trying to put her to sleep?

259
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,800
And even though we were still in a lot of danger,

260
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,000
I felt safe. I felt like...

261
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,300
everything was gonna be okay, because I wasn't alone.

262
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,400
Paige...

263
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,100
you're not alone.

264
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,500
I'm with you.

265
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,300
Everything is gonna be okay.

266
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,400
Do you believe me?

267
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:56,300
- Yeah, I do.
- All right, good girl.

268
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,900
You just hang in there.

269
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,100
Yeah. Paul.

270
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:09,800
- Any sign of Kennex and Dorian?
- Uh, nothing so far.

271
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,200
Keep your men back, but I want drones and spotters on every window and exit.

272
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,400
- I want to know what's happening with my men.
- Yeah, you got it, Captain.

273
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,200
There's no way I can get a fission igniter.

274
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,800
What if there was a way to give them what they wanted

275
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,000
and stall them at the same time?

276
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,100
- What have you got?
- I could build a replica.

277
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,200
What if they can spot a fake?

278
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,900
I can make one that will pass a scan.

279
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:42,200
If they test it out or try and use it immediately, then we're out of luck.

280
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,200
That's risk we'll have to take. Let's get started.

281
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,000
- Captain?
- Yep?

282
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,200
Lucas Vincent... he's a high-level operative in the Holy Reclamation Army,

283
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:57,500
a decentralized network of terrorist cells with anti-Western bias and a history of hostage taking,

284
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,300
none of them ending well.

285
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,900
Last August they took over an embassy near Tokyo.

286
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,900
Same MO... they enter with force,

287
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,900
drew the attention of the media and law enforcement

288
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,800
using human hostages as collateral for their demands.

289
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,600
- What happened?
- They facilitated the release of several of their comrades.

290
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,500
Once they got what they wanted, they released the hostages.

291
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,500
But they're not afraid to take lives... including their own.

292
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,000
You know, everyone trips on stairs,

293
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,300
and it's calculated to occur in one in every 2,222 occasions.

294
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,200
That's very interesting.

295
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,500
- You know what would be interesting, John?
- What?

296
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,200
If you told me that ice fishing story again.

297
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,700
If you want to get in shape, we can run the O-course every weekend.

298
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,300
O- can we?

299
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,800
Let's split up.

300
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,600
Dorian, you okay?

301
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,700
John, get over here.

302
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,200
(Identify tech)

303
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,300
Floor's clear.

304
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,600
You okay?

305
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,400
You took one to the head.

306
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,500
Yeah, ricochet.

307
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,100
- Whatcha got?
- I'm not sure.

308
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,800
But there's writing on it. "Start. "

309
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,400
- Start?
- Start.

310
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,000
You I.D.'d him?

311
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:19,600
His name is Michael Demerais. He's a member of the Holy Reclamation Army.

312
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,200
So they're behind this.

313
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,800
Maybe not.

314
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,900
It's a facemaker.

315
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,900
So who's this guy?

316
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:47,000
His name is Gregor Stone. He has a few priors for armed robbery.

317
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Why would they impersonate members of a radical organization?

318
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,600
What's wrong?

319
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,700
My dynamic voltage scaling has been damaged by the bullet.

320
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,500
You want to say that a little less complicated?

321
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,400
I won't be able to walk in five minutes.

322
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:13,400
- Where are our v-tols?
- I'm working on it.

323
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,200
Based on the frequency at which these transmit...

324
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,900
I detect seven facemakers in the building.

325
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:29,100
If they hide their identities, why not just wear a mask?

326
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,500
- Why pretend to be something else?
- That's a good question.

327
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,100
All right.

328
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,200
Let's try and fix you.

329
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,200
How does it look?

330
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,900
Yeah, it's, uh, totally fine.

331
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,900
- You can hardly see it.
- Okay.

332
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,400
So, what do I do?

333
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,100
All right, there's a magenta colored tendon.

334
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,600
I need you to cut it.

335
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,700
All right, is... is that thing clean?

336
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:09,300
- Of course it is.
- Are you sure?

337
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,300
Positive.

338
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,300
Damn it.

339
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,900
- I said magenta.
- It was magenta.

340
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,500
- I said magenta. That was lavender.
- The hell's magenta?

341
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,100
There's 50 shades of purple in there.

342
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,400
I'm telling you, that was the lavender one.

343
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,200
- No, no. Okay, wait a minute.
- What?

344
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,600
- What are you doing with that?
- Gotta cut the wire.

345
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,600
- That's not going inside of my head.
- I'm your partner, trust me.

346
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,200
If Rudy were here,

347
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,200
he'd have a really big issue with you right now.

348
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,600
- John...
- Look, it could always be worse.

349
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,700
- John, the statistics...
- You're going to be fine.

350
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,200
Dorian?

351
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,000
Please stop looking at me like that.

352
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,700
You have five minutes to deliver the decoy fission device.

353
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,600
I'm working as fast as I can.

354
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,200
Four minutes, 45 seconds.

355
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,900
You can't put a clock on perfection.

356
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:12,000
Clearly someone was rushing when they designed your manners chip.

357
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,300
- John, are you there?
- I can hear you, Paige.

358
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,800
They've moved.

359
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,900
They keep going to a corner window...

360
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:31,400
- doing something.
- What are they doing?

361
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,500
I don't know.

362
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:39,000
My sister... she's crying.

363
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,000
And one of the guards, he keeps looking at her.

364
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,900
Look, I promise I'll get to you soon, Paige.

365
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,200
What's your sister's name?

366
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,400
Jenna.

367
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,400
- Jenna?
- Her middle name's Gertrude.

368
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,600
- Ooh, that's rough.
- What's yours?

369
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:00,000
Oh, no. No, no, we're not doing that.

370
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,800
Come on, tell me.

371
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,900
All right, but you better not tell anyone, okay?

372
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,200
Police orders.

373
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,200
It's Reginald.

374
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,400
My dad was a big Elton John fan.

375
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,800
Who?

376
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,400
Elton John. He's an old-time singer.

377
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,000
Apparently, his real name was Reginald.

378
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,900
You okay?

379
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,300
Gross.

380
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,400
- But good.
- Something's happening.

381
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,500
Get over here and help.

382
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,500
One of the gunmen,

383
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,600
- he's hurt.
- Who shot you?

384
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,900
There are two men in the building.

385
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,600
- Cops?
- I don't know.

386
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,700
Where's Gregor?

387
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,800
- We got separated.
- Do you want us to look for him?

388
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:53,900
No.

389
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,300
Put more men on the stairwell. No one gets up on this floor.

390
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,100
Go. You, go.

391
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,700
John, they know you're in the building.

392
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,900
They sent a couple guys with giant guns to guard the stairs.

393
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,200
Even if you do get up here, how are you gonna get in?

394
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,300
Trust me, Paige.

395
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,900
We'll find a way to get to you.

396
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,300
I'm disappointed in you, Captain Maldonado.

397
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,500
I thought we were getting along so well.

398
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,000
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I said no cops.

399
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,000
I pulled my men back.

400
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,900
The only people I have there are conducting the evacuation, outside the building.

401
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,700
Then how do you explain the two cops

402
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,700
my men just killed downstairs?

403
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,000
He's bluffing.

404
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,600
I don't know what men you killed, but they weren't mine.

405
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,500
We made a deal. I get you what you want, no one else dies.

406
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,100
When do I get my fission ignitor?

407
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,500
It's on its way, ten minutes or less.

408
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,100
Great. Every minute longer

409
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,800
is another body you'll be scraping off the pavement.

410
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,300
Keep your mouth shut.

411
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,200
John?

412
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,900
I'm going out there. I can't leave Jenna alone.

413
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,300
- Paige, that's a bad idea.
- I have to. I have to.

414
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:48,300
- We're a few floors away.
- She needs me.

415
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,800
I need her.

416
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,600
If we're gonna die...

417
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,400
...I want to be with her.

418
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,800
She's my sister.

419
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,900
Now is my only chance to blend in without anyone seeing me.

420
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:09,800
- Paige, just stay where you are.
- I'll leave my phone open.

421
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,100
- You'll be able to hear what's going on.
- Paige, it's too risky.

422
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:16,100
- Listen to me, just stay put.
- I have to.

423
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:19,600
- please
- Paige, please, just listen to me. Paige.

424
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,900
Paige, are you there? Paige?

425
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,600
I think I can do that.

426
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,000
I'm here.

427
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,200
It'll be okay.

428
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,000
Detective Paul?

429
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,600
- Copy.
- The ignitor is ready for delivery.

430
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,200
- Come on.
- Come on, come on, speed it up.

431
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,100
- It's good to go, sir.
- Okay, waiting on your order.

432
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,600
Send it.

433
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,100
Let's get her up.

434
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,700
Excuse me.

435
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,500
I have to go to the bathroom.

436
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,100
You're not going to make me pee on the floor, are you?

437
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,300
You've got 30 seconds.

438
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,600
Hey, boss...

439
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,500
we're getting another delivery.

440
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,200
The drone's coming.

441
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,500
(CALL CONNECTED)

442
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:35,100
We had an agreement, Lucas. We've operated in good faith here.

443
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,600
I believe in honoring a deal.

444
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,500
Stand by.

445
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,400
I'll let you know how we're gonna release the hostages.

446
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,300
Let's hope they buy it.

447
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,100
Send the message to the other crew now.

448
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:54,600
They should be ready. It's time to wind this up.

449
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:59,300
- What other crew?
- Maybe there are more of them in the building.

450
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:03,000
- Maybe they're outside the building.
- But the jammer's still on. If they have people outside,

451
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,700
they wouldn't be able to talk to each other.

452
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,900
Unless they were talking some other way.

453
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,300
"Start. "

454
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,500
They must be using it as some sort of point-to-point communication

455
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:35,300
- with someone in proximity - of the building.
- Paige said the man in charge...

456
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,300
kept going to the window.

457
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,900
I didn't think they'd come through.

458
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,600
What if there's a tracking device?

459
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,800
We're not taking it anyway.

460
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,300
It doesn't matter.

461
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,700
He doesn't want the tech. That doesn't make sense.

462
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,200
Why take hostages and negotiate for tech you don't want?

463
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,800
Maybe it's a diversion.

464
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,700
Yeah, but for what?

465
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,300
Are there any targets of value in the adjacent buildings?

466
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,100
(DIETER INC. PRECIOUS METALS - CRESCENT AVE.)

467
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:26,400
The only target of any value is a precious metal weigh station specializing in palladium.

468
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,900
It's a heist.

469
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,800
Palladium. That would make all this worthwhile.

470
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,000
(10 min)

471
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,600
Wrap it up. We're out of here in ten.

472
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,300
Hang in there, Daniel.

473
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:13,600
When this is over, we'll all be on a beach somewhere,

474
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,100
you'll be as good as new.

475
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,300
I need a doctor.

476
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,400
Soon.

477
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,500
What's that beeping?

478
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,300
You and the guys pick three hostages.

479
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,000
Why?

480
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,400
We may need insurance. Let's pack it up.

481
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,100
(LIGHTBOMB AUDIO DETECTED)
John, they've activated a light bomb.

482
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,600
They're gonna kill the hostages.

483
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,200
- What are you doing?
- Sticking to the plan. We're going up.

484
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,200
John, they know we're here.

485
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,800
They're expecting us to come up the stairs.

486
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,200
We won't make it to the 25th floor alive.

487
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,800
You heard him. We have no choice.

488
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,800
I don't have a choice.

489
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,400
People's lives are in jeopardy.

490
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:12,500
Dorian, You've been shot. Your head's full of bubble gum. You can't do this alone.

491
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:16,300
- I have to.
- Then I'm coming with you.

492
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,300
You can't.

493
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,800
I'm designed to do this, John.

494
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,900
(Identify Device Explosive/light bomb)

495
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,900
(Hostage/Civilian)

496
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,100
It's time.

497
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:01,000
(Identify subject Vicent Lucas)
Jenna... why don't you come with me.

498
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,200
No, no, no. Don't you touch her.

499
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,400
Don't you touch her. Take me!

500
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,200
Let her go! I will shoot you!

501
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,600
- No, no! Take me! No, leave her!
- I will shoot you!

502
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,600
Take me! Please! Me!

503
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,200
Police! Get down!

504
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,100
What's your name?

505
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,200
I've never killed a man I didn't know.

506
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,700
But then again...

507
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:50,900
you're not a man.

508
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,400
Are you?

509
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:59,200
- Nice of you to show up, Gregor.
- Where the hell have you been?

510
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,100
We thought you were dead.

511
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,900
- Maldonado?
- John?

512
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:18,200
The hostages are secure. The whole thing is a palladium heist.

513
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,300
Shut it off... now!

514
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,300
They got us to block the alarm system.

515
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,600
Turn the jammer off!

516
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,200
Detective Paul, turn off the jammer now!

517
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:27,500
Shut it off.

518
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:39,800
Let's go.

519
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,400
Thank you.

520
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:08,900
John?

521
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,200
You must be Paige.

522
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,900
- Thank you.
- No. Thank you.

523
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,800
You were very brave.

524
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,600
You helped save a lot of lives today.

525
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,800
Where's your partner?

526
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,600
Oh, he's, uh...

527
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,500
he's getting patched up.

528
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,600
John, this is my sister. This is Jenna.

529
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:45,300
Jenna, it's a pleasure to meet you. I've heard a lot about you.

530
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,500
I'm glad you're okay.

531
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:14,900
Thanks.

532
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,800
I've got some intel on the perps.

533
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,300
Guy behind it all was Gerald Leighton.

534
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,100
We linked him and his men to four high-value robberies in the last two years.

535
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,700
Using police jamming protocol to initiate a palladium heist.

536
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:31,100
- Pretty elaborate for a bunch of thieves.
- It's going to be a paperwork nightmare.

537
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,900
And I thought you had come down here to thank me.

538
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,900
For what? Doing your job?

539
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,900
Just for the record, I did tell you to get out of the building, right?

540
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,300
I swear, all I heard was static.

541
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,200
Oi! I've got a bone to pick with you, Detective.

542
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,300
Chewing gum? Really?

543
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,200
Would you fix a race car with chewing gum?

544
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,100
Uh, yeah, if it was busted, and I need to win a race.

545
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,100
He'll need extensive diagnostics.

546
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,500
Ah, that can wait.

547
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,700
Come on, let's go get some noodles.

548
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,200
You are aware that I don't eat.

549
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,500
Perfect. I'm buying. Let's roll.

550
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,100
Well, I'll just wait here, shall I?

551
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:24,200
Thank you for what you did back there.

552
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,600
Don't mention it.

553
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:33,700
Besides, no one messes with my coffee warmer.

554
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:41,500
Hey, John, you know that story you told Paige,

555
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,100
when you fell through the ice as a kid?

556
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,500
When that gun was pointed at my head, I felt something similar.

557
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,500
I- I didn't want to die.

558
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:01,600
I know it's not the same with me, but...

559
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,600
Hey, dead is dead.

560
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,200
Yeah.

561
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,000
I suppose so.

562
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,000
Why don't you chuck some music on?

563
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:31,000
Elton John, huh? You heard me, didn't you?

564
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,400
Don't. Don't. Please, don't do that.

565
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,900
Whatever you say, Reginald.

566
