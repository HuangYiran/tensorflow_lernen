1
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,252
我收拾衣柜的时候
When I was going through my wardrobe

2
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:46,421
在地板上我发现了一个多余的发夹
I found an extra hairpin on the floor

3
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:49,466
那不算什么，我还在床上发现了她的头发
That's nothing, I found her hair in my bed.

4
00:00:53,971 --> 00:01:00,185
我想，那只是另一出心力交瘁的悲剧，
Just another tragedy of a down-and-out, I guess

5
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:03,605
我所卖出的东西
For I'm selling the thing

6
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:06,900
代表了我的生命和我的幸福的一切...
That means every thing to my life...

7
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,660
有的女人，她们走到哪儿，欢乐就跟到哪儿；
Some women bring happines...

8
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:21,331
有些，则是及时行乐
wherever they go.Others, whenever they go.

9
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,167
我二者兼顾
I do both.

10
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,586
丈夫们乐意看到我来，
Husbands like tosee me come...

11
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:28,130
妻子们则喜欢送我走
wives prefer to seeme go.

12
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,716
她在那，那就是她
There she is.That's her.

13
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:33,010
她谁的丈夫没睡过啊?
Whose husband didn't she sleep with?

14
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,137
- 她现在跟谁在一起啊?- 谁知道
- Who's she with now?- Who knows.

15
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:38,265
- 她比我想的老- 看，看好
- She's older than I thought.- Look. Watch.

16
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:40,809
这会给她个教训
This will teach her.

17
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:44,897
对不起，Erlynne太太,但是那个账户已经
I'm sorry, Mrs Erlynne, but that account was closed.

18
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:47,441
被Fairchild太太停了
By Mrs Fairchild.

19
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,487
我希望你在我点Bordeaux酒之前告诉我就好了
I wish you'd told me before I ordered the Bordeaux.

20
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,283
什么Bordeaux酒, Erlynne太太?
What Bordeaux, Mrs Erlynne?

21
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:59,119
Joe, 你是我喜欢的那类男人
Joe, you're my kind of guy.

22
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:03,624
- 她在我后面吗?- 穿兰色衣服
- Is she behind me?- In the blue.

23
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,876
那就算在Kleghorn参议员的帐上吧
Charge it to Senator Kleghorn.

24
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:08,837
Fairchild太太边上坐的就是Kleghorn太太
That's Mrs Kleghorn sitting next to Mrs Fairchild.

25
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:12,216
- 世界可真小啊- 她左边的是Winters太太
- What a small world.- And Mrs Winters on her right.

26
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:15,052
哦，越来越小了
And getting smaller.

27
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,179
你要从后面走吗?
You wanna go outthe back?

28
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:21,308
不，如果你从后门走就再也别想从前面进来了，Joe
No, if you go out the back, you'll never come in the front, Joe.

29
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,978
淑女怎么来，便怎么走
A lady always leaves the way she came.

30
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:33,153
你看看她，我以为我丈夫更有品呢
I thought my husband had more taste.

31
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:36,448
听说你要走真难过，Erlynne太太
So sorry to hear you're leaving us, Mrs Erlynne.

32
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:40,285
我要退房？- 我给您备好账单
- I'm leaving you?- I'll prepare your bill.

33
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,083
我让你开个价，
I ask you to make me an offer

34
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:51,171
我不知道那会值多少
I don't know how much it will bring

35
00:02:51,547 --> 00:02:53,340
虽然那并不算太多
It isn't a lot...

36
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:55,884
但那已经倾我所有
but it's all I've got

37
00:02:56,301 --> 00:03:00,222
把老金戒也一起卖了？
Pooled by an old gold ring?

38
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:04,226
有时我一贫如洗，象个乞丐
It's known me as poor as a beggar

39
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:08,856
有时我挥金如土，象个国王
And it's known me as rich as a king

40
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:13,986
我既下过地狱，又上过天堂
And it's known me in hell And in heaven as well

41
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:19,074
把老金戒也一起卖了？
Pooled by an old gold ring?

42
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:29,668
我环境的突变...
My sudden changeing circumstance...

43
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:32,296
并不是我离开的唯一理由
was not the only reason for my departure.

44
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:36,466
夏季的意大利海滩吸引着富者和名人
The italian coast in summerattracts the rich and famous.

45
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:38,594
我没名气又穷
I'm infamous and poor.

46
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:40,679
挺接近的
Close enough.

47
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,391
一扇门关闭，另一扇开启了
One door closes,another opens.

48
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:48,478
有时那并不是你所期待的门
Sometimes that door isnot the one you expect.

49
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:53,859
我看到了我的机会并决定抓住

50
00:04:56,547 --> 00:04:59,842
Meg, 亲爱的，快过来

这是城里最好的手套店

55
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:10,853
她会给你个好折扣

56
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:15,649
你去吧，我会找到你丈夫的，别担心

- 你的手看上去差不多- 你说什么?
- Your hand looks about right.- I beg your pardon?

60
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,723
我的小妹妹，她把细节都说了...

61
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,517
就是忘了告诉我尺码，你介意吗?

不，当然不会

63
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,939
第一次有点挤
It's always a little snugthe first time.

64
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:58,108
也许你该退去戒指
Maybe you should takeoff your ring.

65
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,402
那是我的结婚戒指，我不能把它拿下来

可却是个了不起的桥梁合伙人
But an excellent bridge partner.

要不我肯定会忍受不了他的

I feel like a princessin a fairly tale.

86
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,486
你就是公主

87
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:26,697
那是因为我嫁给了王子

我把她完全骗住了，可怜的女孩
I have her completely fooled,poor girl.

如果我能骗到一个象你太太一样漂亮的女孩我就不会仍是单身汉了
If I could fool a woman aspretty, I wouldn't be a bachelor.

大脚，浮桥

101
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:41,355
如果期待能够修正，那就是她的浮桥了

102
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:43,398
我想的都得病了

- Three, four? I've simply lost count.- That's bigamy.

105
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,656
重婚是有过多妻子
Bigamy is having one wifetoo many.

106
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:52,366
那是一夫一妻
So is monogamy

107
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:55,702
每个人都该有个合理的婚姻基础一个相互……
One should always have a properbasis for marriage. A mutual...

108
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:57,496
- 误解?- 没错
- Misunderstanding?- Exactly.

109
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,957
男人只有一个女人是不会快乐的
A man can't be happywith one woman.

110
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:03,168
只要不爱，男人跟任何女人都会快乐
A man can be happy with any woman.As long as he doesn't love her.

111
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,837
对于一个永不言婚的男人来说...
For a man who's never thoughtof getting married...

112
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:06,880
你知道的够多的

我对婚姻考虑甚为周详所以至今未婚
I've thought very seriously of marrying.That's why I'm still single.

114
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,884

Hear, hear.

115
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:14,429
我只是还没遇到合适的看Cecil, 还跟Edna在一起
I just haven't met the right woman.Look at Cecil, still with Edna.

116
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,849
一个人该在婚礼前大睁双眼...
One keeps one's eyes wide openbefore the wedding...

117
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,601
其后就要睁一眼闭一眼了

- 就那么回事- 没错

119
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,948

00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:35,659
哦，幸运的家伙
Oh, lucky blighter!

121
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:47,421
你看着不怎么开心啊
You don't look as ifyou're enjoying yourself.

122
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:49,673
哦，我开心，晚会很好
Oh, I am. It's a verynice party.

123

- Can I get you a drink?- No, thank you. I don't drink.

124
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:54,178
你不喝?
You don't drink?

125
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,805
- 我看上去象个假正经的人吗?- 不，当然不是
- Do I seem like a prig?- No, of course not.

是我的Julia姑姑我父亲的姐姐

我幼年丧母

这是我有的她唯一的照片
It's the only picture Ihave of her.

130
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:16,325
我父亲从没再婚

131
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:18,869
她似她女儿般美貌
She's every bit as beaultifulas her daughter.

132
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:24,291
我冒犯你了吗?我是在恭维你呢
Have I offended you?I meant it as a compliment.

133
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:27,711
- 你过于恭维我了- 我会马上停止
- You pay me too many compliments.- I'll stop at once.

134
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:32,049
- 谢谢你- 你只要知道，我是真心的
- Thank you.- Just so you know, I meant every one.

135
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:35,260
你假装坏，但...
You pretend to be bad, but...

136
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:38,430
- 其实你不是- 没有好坏之分
- you're not really.- There is no good or bad.

137
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:40,057
人只有迷人和沉闷之分
People are either charmingor tedious.

138
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:42,518
如果我是后者，我真诚道歉
If I've been the latter,I sincerely apologize.

139
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,479
- 我希望我们能成朋友- 我们已经是了，对吧?
- I'd like us to become friends.- We already are, aren't we?

140
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:49,858
那就别奉承我或是说些愚蠢的恭维话
Not if you keep flattering me andpaying me silly compliments.

141
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:51,693
定义“愚蠢”
Define silly.

142
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:54,154
你得保证
I want your word.

143
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:57,491
我发现要想不食言就别乱保证
I find the best way to keep myword is never to give it.

144
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:18,971
看到漂亮女人永远都是一种荣幸
It's always a pleasureto see a pretty woman.

145
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:20,931
天气不错
Good day.

146
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,990
一定得是特别的东西...
It has to be somethingreally special...

147
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:41,535
是我妻子的生日
My wife's birthday.

148
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:45,247
这个非常特别
This is a very specialobject.

149
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:01,805
你觉得怎么样?
What do you think?

150
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:05,225
蓝宝石很衬你的眼睛
The sapphire matches your eyes.

151
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:08,937
是给我妻子的
It's for my wife.

152
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:11,148
男人可不该给妻子买珠宝
A man should never buy hiswife jewellery.

153
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:12,941
那是为什么?
And why is that?

154
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:15,944
那会让她猜测他会给情妇买什么
It makes her wonder whathe bought his mistress.

155
00:12:16,195 --> 00:12:19,364
我妻子没什么可猜测的
My wife has nothing towonder about.

156
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,617
她是个幸运的女人
She's a lucky woman.

157
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,703
如果我是你妻子...
If I was your wife...

158
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:27,789
- 这才是我想要的- 一把扇子?
- this is what I'd want.- A fan?

159
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:31,126
不为鼓动空气，为了鼓动心灵
Not for stirring the air,for stirring the heart.

160
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:32,419
是经历百年...
For centuries...

161
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:36,131
男女间的性欲语言
an erotic language betweenmen an women.

162
00:12:38,342 --> 00:12:42,888
如果女人把它这样放在胸前那意思是“我爱你”
If a woman placed it on her breastlike this, it meant "I love you".

163
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:46,016
"我几时能见你?"
"When can I see you?"

164
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,310
"等我"
"Wait for me."

165
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,314
"你可以亲吻我"
"You may kiss me."

166
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,652
"我们正被监视"
"We're being watched."

167
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,367
我被出卖了
I'm sold.

168
00:13:10,374 --> 00:13:11,708
多少钱?
How much?

169
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:13,836
不，那个不是卖品
No, it's not for sale.

170
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,879
非卖品？
Not for sale.

171
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:21,301
那会伤透我妈妈的心
It would break mymom's heart.

172
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:23,095
我妈妈
My mama.

173
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:28,600
真金的
Real gold.

174
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:33,480
如果你倾囊而出谁给我买浓缩咖啡啊?
If you give him everything, who'sgoing to buy me an espresso?

175
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,363
我的后背啊
My back.

176
00:13:43,574 --> 00:13:46,493
而且到处都是美国人
And Americans everywhere.

177
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:50,455
你根本不会知道他们国家正经历经济危机
You'd never know there was adepression in that country.

178
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:54,209
拜托，我晕倒前喝点东西吧
Please, something to drinkbefore I faint.

179
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,045
他们不是买东西，他们在掠夺
They don't shop, they pillage.

180
00:13:57,296 --> 00:13:59,006
而且他们说话声音太吵
And they speak loudly.

181
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:02,634
难道他们整个民族都有听力障碍吗?
Could the entire nation behard of hearing?

182
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:04,761
可能是吃的东西有问题，也许?
Something in the diet, perhaps?

183
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:06,972
但是我们有美国朋友啊，妈妈
But we have Americanfriends, mama.

184
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:09,766
但他们不需要知道我们是怎么讲究他们的
They don't need to know whatwe say about them.

185
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,020
如果每个人都知道别人背后怎么讲究自己...
If everyone knew what everyonesaid of each other...

186
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,897
那人生在世不会有超过四个朋友了
there wouldn't be four friendsin the world.

187
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:16,273
我喜欢美国
I like America.

188
00:14:16,607 --> 00:14:19,401
你找不到一个社会由荒蛮进入颓废
Name me another society that's gonefrom barbarism to decadence...

189
00:14:19,735 --> 00:14:22,404
都不劳神经历文明时代
without bothering to create acivilization in between.

190
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:24,531
全拜美国人所赐
Tribute to American efficiency.

191
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:28,160
- Windemere先生在那- 他得加入我们
- There's Mr Windemere.- He must join us then.

192
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:31,580
他看不见你，妈妈
He can't see you, mama.

193
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:33,499
跟他一起的是谁?
Who's that with him?

194
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:35,584
好像是他妻子
Looks like his wife.

195
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:38,086
不，我看不是
No, I don't think it is.

196
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:43,467
我现在看不见了，他们进车里了
I can't see now.They're getting into the car.

197
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:45,969
如果她进车里肯定是他妻子
It must be the wife if she'sgetting into the car.

198
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:48,138
不是的
It wasn't her.

199
00:14:48,472 --> 00:14:50,432
那我就得知道到底是谁
Then I must know who it is.

200
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:52,643
我觉得我们该管自己的事
I think we should mind ourown business.

201
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:54,603
我自己的事太无聊了
My own business bores me.

202
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:57,272
我更喜欢管别人闲事
I much prefer other people's.

203
00:14:57,606 --> 00:14:59,900
可怜的Meg，她多可爱
Poor little Meg,she's so sweet.

204
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,110
而且她没妈妈
And the girl has no mother.

205
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:05,113
- 我想把她揽在怀里- 我曾有过类似想法
- I want to take her to my breast.- I had a similar thought.

206
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:08,992
我猜Windemere先生不会想听到这些
I don't suppose Mr Windemerewould be pleased to hear it.

207
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:10,744
神圣的赐福...
Merital bliss...

208
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:13,121
对两个人是巨大的负担, Tuppy
is a great burden to placeon two people, Tuppy.

209
00:15:13,497 --> 00:15:15,999
有时第三者是摆脱负担的必需
Sometimes a third person isneeded to lighten the load.

210
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:19,837
看起来， Windemere先生是赞许你的
It would seem,Mr Windemere agrees with you.

211
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:56,039
我能猜出你干了什么
I can guess what you were doing.

212
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:59,126
给我买生日礼物?
Shopping for my birthday present?

213
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:06,425
我对了
I was right.

214
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,218
你买什么了?
What did you get?

215
00:16:08,427 --> 00:16:11,013
什么也没买，你老得不配买礼物
Not a thing. You're too oldfor presents.

216
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:15,475
- 一个提示，一个小不点的提示- 你得等着瞧
- A hint. A tiny speck of a hint.- You'll have to wait and see.

217
00:16:17,603 --> 00:16:20,147
- 香水?- 不，别猜了
- Perfume?- No, stop it.

218
00:16:20,731 --> 00:16:22,524
一本诗集?
A book of poems?

219
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:24,443
一件套装?
A dress?

220
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:26,278
一个象女爵爷提的，用小爪子做扣的
A crocodile handbag like theone the Contessa has...

221
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:29,656
鳄鱼皮的手袋？
with the little claws hangingoff the bottom?

222
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,035
别猜了
No more guessing.

223
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:34,828
Robert?
Robert?

224
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:37,915
保证我，我们不会落得跟那些老家伙一样的下场...
Promise we won't end up like thoseold married couples...

225
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:41,877
虽然在吃饭时面对面坐着但无话可谈
sitting opposite each other atdinner with nothing to say.

226
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:44,505
你，无话可谈?
You, with nothing to say?

227
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:47,716
我保证
I promise.

228
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:50,093
我们要一直彼此讲真话?
We'll always tell eachother the truth?

229
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:52,513
除了生日
Except around birthdays.

230
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:03,732
你很活跃啊在看什么书?
You're feisty.What have you been reading?

231
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:08,153
- 什么意思?- 没有，挺好
- What do you mean?- No, it's nice.

232
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:09,947
关上灯
Turn out the lights.

233
00:17:10,322 --> 00:17:12,950
-可我想看你－拜托
- But I like to see you.- Please?

234
00:17:33,345 --> 00:17:34,930
我都要了
I'll take them all.

235
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:37,975
- 你好，女士- 请原谅
- Good day, madam.- Excuse me.

236
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:39,434
我买了一件套装
I bought a suit.

237
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:41,645
正在改，给Margaret Windemere
It's being altered.For Margaret Windemere.

238
00:17:41,937 --> 00:17:44,189
啊, Windemere太太请稍等
Ah, Mrs Windemere.One moment, please.

239
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:45,440
谢谢
Thank you.

240
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:55,409
请原谅你是美国人，对吧？
Forgive me.You're American, aren't you?

241
00:17:55,868 --> 00:17:58,120
我从New York来，Erlynne太太
I'm from New York.Mrs Erlynne.

242
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:00,664
Rhode 岛，Windemere太太
Rhode Island.Mrs Windemere.

243
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:05,586
我需要点建议，真心话
I need an opinion from here.Now be honesty.

244
00:18:09,006 --> 00:18:10,632
你会穿它吗?
Would you wear it?

245
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:19,850
这会让人失去想像力，是吧?
Well, it doesn't leave muchto the imagination, does it?

246
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:24,271
那要看有多少想像力，有些男人比其他的多些
That depends on the imagination.Some men have more than others.

247
00:18:25,397 --> 00:18:28,650
我觉得肯定不够端庄
I suppose it's certainly immodest.

248
00:18:29,026 --> 00:18:30,903
你觉得它粗俗吗?
Do you think it's vulgar?

249
00:18:32,988 --> 00:18:35,365
有些人会那么想
Some people might.

250
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:38,952
你丈夫跟你一起来了吗?我需要一个男人的意见
Is your husband with you?I'd love a man's opinion.

251
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:41,830
我可以告诉你，他很保守
I can tell you.He's very conservative.

252
00:18:42,164 --> 00:18:44,416
一个女人是不会了解她丈夫的
A woman doesn't knowher own husband.

253
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,960
哦，我了解 Robert我们都结婚快一年了
Oh, I know Robert.We've been married over a year.

254
00:18:47,211 --> 00:18:50,047
一年？简直就跟一辈子似的
A year? Pratically forever.

255
00:18:50,422 --> 00:18:52,049
给你，女士
Here it is, signora.

256
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:54,218
哦 谢谢
Oh, thank you.

257
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:57,387
多谢你，请再光顾
Thank you very much.Come back again to see us.

258
00:18:58,764 --> 00:19:01,558
- 再见- 你不要帽子吗?
- Goodbye- You're not taking the hat?

259
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:04,144
颜色很合你，你不要吗?
The colour looks perfect on you.Don't you like it?

260
00:19:04,436 --> 00:19:07,523
不，我没场合戴，周日并不上教堂
No, I've nowhere to wear it.It's not exactly church on sunday.

261
00:19:07,773 --> 00:19:09,107
为什么?
Why not?

262
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:11,610
你能想像人们会怎么说吗?
Can you imagine whatpeople would say?

263
00:19:11,944 --> 00:19:13,403
哦，如果我们总让别人左右我们...
Well, if we're always guided byother people's thoughts...

264
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:15,405
那还要自己的头脑干什么用呢?
what's the point ofhaving our own?

265
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,535
高兴人士你，Ewin太太
It was nice meeting you,Mrs Ewin.

266
00:19:19,827 --> 00:19:22,079
- Erlynne.- Erlynne.
- Erlynne- Erlynne

267
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:41,056
她本来在一个小旅馆...
She was staying in a pensione...

268
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:43,892
现在她住在离俱乐部几分钟远的别墅里

我老是看见他

他整天来来去去

她只穿最新的时装

274

肯定有某人给她很慷慨的资助
Somebody must be giving her a verygenerous allowance.

275
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:19,136
Silence!

276
00:20:19,595 --> 00:20:24,099
如果Tuppy还不清醒过来她就快把手伸进他口袋里了
And she'll have her hand in Tuppy'spocket next, if he doesn't wake up.

277
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:26,935
她不过是个公众的妓女
She's nothing better thana common prostitute.

278
00:20:29,188 --> 00:20:32,733
Windemere太太不知道吗?
And Mrs Windemere has no idea?

279
00:20:33,442 --> 00:20:35,152
根本不知道
None at all.

280
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:49,082
- 对不起- 她肯定在露台
- I'm sorry.- She must be on the terrace.

281
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:09,645
对不起，我可不想吓到你

- Yes, you did.- Yes, you did. What's that?

283

我正准备我生日晚会的菜单

284
00:21:15,526 --> 00:21:18,529
龙虾的意大利文怎么说?

我以为你同意不往我家打电话?
I thought you agreed not tocall me at home?

291
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:52,437
你老带着丈夫，我怎么引诱你啊?

太慢了，走吧

293
00:21:57,943 --> 00:21:59,194

- 你在工作吗?- 钱可不睡觉

299
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:16,545
该死
Bugger!

300
00:22:17,713 --> 00:22:19,965
付钱的工作吸引人
All paying jobs absorb...

301
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,842
也会使人堕落
and degrade the mind.

302
00:22:22,176 --> 00:22:23,385
你没有付钱的工作
You never had a paying job.

303
00:22:23,635 --> 00:22:25,179
我在休庭阶段

304
00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:28,265

不，当然不会

309
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:54,958
如果你非要护送那女人去看歌剧别跟我们坐一起
If you have to escort that woman tothe opera, please don't sit with us.

310
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:56,335

Erlynne 太太有自己的座位

他当然是在运作她的投资了

316
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:09,431
你太爱嚼舌根了
You're so fond of gossip.

317
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,683
根本没给真相一个穿裤子的机会
You don't give the truth a chanceto put its pants on.

318
00:23:11,975 --> 00:23:16,021
亲爱的Tuppy，没穿裤子的不是真相
It's not the truth that's going withoutpants, dear Tuppy.

319
00:23:16,355 --> 00:23:18,315
你介意别抽烟吗?

歌剧让我感觉太浪漫了

歌唱真是无聊之极
Anything too stupid to besaid is sung.

322
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,532
有什么浪漫的?
How's that romantic?

323
00:23:26,824 --> 00:23:29,827
而且女人也都太肉感了
And the women arealways so fleshy!

324
00:23:30,536 --> 00:23:33,080
对不起，那是我的脚
Excuse me, that's my foot.

325
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:35,040
就在那吗?
Right over here?

326
00:23:35,374 --> 00:23:37,209
我怎么跟你说的？
What did I tell you?

327
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:50,556
别那样，孩子
Stop, boy!

你跟Robert说我们去俱乐部

331
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:04,570
我方向感极差
I have a very poor senseof direction.

332
00:24:04,862 --> 00:24:06,321
你的礼貌才差
You have a very poor senseof decorum.

333
00:24:06,655 --> 00:24:08,824
我从不用那个字，把握不好意思
I never use that word.I'm not sure what it means.

334
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:12,161
- 在俱乐部就得跟其他人在一起- 说对了
- At the club we'd be with other people.- You're right.

335
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:13,829
而我们在这里，在阳光里...

吃着刚从船上打来的鱼...
eating fish, literallyjust off the boat...

337
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:20,169
代替了在Tubby大人和光彩照人的 Cecil中间挤着……
when we could be squashed between LordTubby and Cecil the Scintillating...

338
00:24:20,502 --> 00:24:23,005
听他们抱怨自己的消化病
listening to one or theother gripe about his digestion...

339
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,507
同时混杂着女爵爷哀号……
while the Contessa, in acounter-medley, wails that...

340
00:24:25,716 --> 00:24:27,509
Alessandra比关心自己...
Alessandra cares more for...

341
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:30,554
还更关心蓝腹鸟交配习惯...

342
00:24:30,804 --> 00:24:32,931
Plymdale寡妇转着怪异的眼睛...

死盯着别人的裤子

344

那是我看书时打发的时光

所以，是的，我接受你的意见

346
00:24:42,024 --> 00:24:43,942
我无法争辩，在俱乐部我们得跟其他人一起
I can't argue. At the club, we'dbe with other people.

347
00:24:45,152 --> 00:24:47,196
害怕我们被发现吗?
Afraid we'll be seen?

348
00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:49,656
给人嚼舌根?
Set the chins wagging?

349
00:24:50,491 --> 00:24:53,118
你知道我发现比被人嚼舌根更可怕的是什么?
Do you know what I findworse than being talked about?

350
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:56,747
根本不被人谈起
Not being talked about at all.

351
00:25:39,915 --> 00:25:41,834
Erlynne太太在楼上见你
Mrs Erlynne will see you upstairs.

352
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:48,465
在她卧室

353
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:50,843
谢谢，我不会久呆
Thank you. I won't be long.

354
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,178
"我不会久呆"
"I won't be long."

355
00:26:07,192 --> 00:26:08,610
这很贵
This is expensive.

356
00:26:08,819 --> 00:26:11,280
- 只给你最好的- 我知道，是我付的钱

我们该这么早就喝酒吗?

世界上的某地现在很晚了

00:26:19,329 --> 00:26:21,456
我不想让你觉得这样成习惯了
I don't want you thinkingI make a habit of this.

361
00:26:21,999 --> 00:26:23,584
那是你看上去内疚的原因吗?
Is that why you look so guilty?

362
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:25,627
我不喜欢跟她说谎
I don't like lying to her.

363
00:26:26,211 --> 00:26:28,297
我得走了，她只是去吃饭
I should go.She's only gone to lunch.

364
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,844
这是我现在所有的现金
This is all the cashI have right now.

365
00:26:34,219 --> 00:26:36,471
我会给你建个账号

我遇到Meg了
I met Meg.

368
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:43,812
是个巧遇
It was by chance.

369
00:26:44,646 --> 00:26:47,274
没事的，她不知道我是谁
It's all right,she had no idea who I was.

370
00:26:47,566 --> 00:26:49,067
你跟她说话了吗?
You spoke to her?

371
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:51,778
对，很短，她很漂亮
Yes, for a minute.She's very pretty.

374
00:26:59,828 --> 00:27:01,663
我好奇，很自然的

375
00:27:01,872 --> 00:27:03,999
这些问题没意义
There's no pointto these questions.

376
00:27:05,584 --> 00:27:07,836
- 你爱她吗?- 很爱
- Do you love her?- Very much.

377
00:27:09,338 --> 00:27:11,548
我宁可断臂也不想让Meg受伤
I'd rather cut off my armthan see Meg hurt.

378
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,134
你是在保护她还是保护你的名声?
Are you protecting her oryour reputation?

379
00:27:14,426 --> 00:27:16,803
你对我一无所知
You don't know me at all.

380
00:27:21,058 --> 00:27:22,809
他在你们的新婚之夜也工作吗?
Did he work on yourwedding night?

381
00:27:26,647 --> 00:27:29,483
他很尽责，我为此而敬重他
He's very conscientiousand I respect him for it.

382
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:32,027
假设不是因为工作，假设他有情妇
Suppose it wasn't work,suppose he had a mistress.

383
00:27:33,195 --> 00:27:35,072
哦，那我可不敬重了
Well, I couldn't respect that.

384
00:27:35,322 --> 00:27:36,824
一旦妻子遭背叛...
Once a wife's been betrayed...

385
00:27:37,032 --> 00:27:38,909
她就有依样做的理由
she has the freedom todo likewise.

386
00:27:39,117 --> 00:27:41,328
不，那岂不让她跟那丈夫一样坏了吗?
No, that would make her as badas her husband, wouldn't it?

387
00:27:41,411 --> 00:27:43,205
现代婚姻因彼此欺骗而兴旺
Modern marriage thrives onmutual deception.

388
00:27:43,413 --> 00:27:45,499
我们彼此完全忠诚

389
00:27:45,624 --> 00:27:47,417
你该以他为榜样

我正打算，从现在开始

你不喜欢吗?

哦，我给Robert留着，他喜欢无花果
Oh, I'm saving it for Robert.He loves figs.

393
00:27:58,929 --> 00:28:00,722
那吃我的吧
Share mine, then.

394
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:05,102
我们能去电报局吗?
Can we go to thetelegraph office?

395
00:28:06,144 --> 00:28:08,021
他可能还没吃东西呢
He probably hasn't eaten.

396
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,362
Alberto? Fabrizio?
Alberto? Fabrizio?

00:28:24,663 --> 00:28:27,666
另外, 你的Erlynne太太完全没有原则
And another thing, your Mrs Erlynnehas no principles at all.

402
00:28:28,125 --> 00:28:29,877
我喜欢人甚于原则
I like people more than principles.

403
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,838
没原则的人就更好了
And people without principles,even better.

404
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:36,425
但是Augustus大人她只是要你的钱啊
But Lord Augustus, she onlywants you for your money.

405
00:28:36,633 --> 00:28:38,594
她干嘛不能？那是我最好的资产
Now why shouldn't she?It's my best asset.

406
00:28:39,219 --> 00:28:42,181
又老又胖，完全无脑
Old-ish, fat-ish,absolutely no brain...

407
00:28:42,431 --> 00:28:43,891
成堆的钞票

408
00:28:44,183 --> 00:28:45,934
并不需要贬低自己，Tuppy

409
00:28:45,934 --> 00:28:47,394
让你的朋友们来嘛

410
00:28:50,314 --> 00:28:54,526
在码头，一起徘徊，跟你一样美……
Down by the marina, strolling along,pretty as you please...

411
00:28:54,568 --> 00:28:57,654
猜我看见谁跟Darlington大人在一起?

412
00:29:05,162 --> 00:29:06,788
他们今天没看见他
They haven't seen him today.

413
00:29:29,186 --> 00:29:31,104
你知道我丈夫在哪吗?
Do you know wheremy husband is?

414
00:29:31,396 --> 00:29:33,732
我以为他跟你一起走了，女士

415
00:29:37,486 --> 00:29:38,779

我们去电报局了，你去哪了?

418
00:30:06,557 --> 00:30:09,059
我们也许刚巧错过了

419
00:30:42,134 --> 00:30:45,721
现在我看见叔叔了他跟那美国女人在一起
Now I see uncle.He's with the american woman.

420
00:30:47,973 --> 00:30:50,350
口红过多，衣服过少
Too much rouge and notenough clothing.

421
00:30:50,684 --> 00:30:52,895
她使尽招数引诱那可怜的男人
She's appealing to the worstin the poor man.

422
00:30:53,228 --> 00:30:54,897
那是女人的拿手好戏

423
00:30:55,063 --> 00:30:58,400
我听说她离开New York连酒店的帐都没付
I heard she left New Yorkwithout paying her hotel bill.

424
00:30:58,609 --> 00:31:00,319
真是个丑闻
Quite a scandal.

425
00:31:00,527 --> 00:31:03,238
- 谁? 你认识的人吗?- 是个你不想认识的人
- Who? Someone you know?- Someone you don't want to know.

426
00:31:03,906 --> 00:31:05,741
不，Steer Clear
No. Steer clear.

427
00:31:05,991 --> 00:31:07,951
她就是跟Augustus大人在一起的

428
00:31:08,452 --> 00:31:10,162
你已经认识Erlynne太太了，是吧？

- 没有.- 可我看见你了

哦，那是你的脚吗?

431
00:31:17,669 --> 00:31:19,838
你到哪去找合脚的鞋啊?
Wherever do you findshoes to fit?

432
00:31:20,172 --> 00:31:22,382
我的脚跟我身体其他部分很成比例

哦，是的，当然

434
00:31:25,219 --> 00:31:27,971
尽管他们有在奇特的地方出现的习惯

435

那些人在盯着我们看呢

436
00:31:31,141 --> 00:31:32,142
谁?

别理会他们

那是我哥哥的妻子和她的朋友Plymdale女士

439
00:31:40,901 --> 00:31:43,821

441
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:49,201
因为伤心，她的头发越发的金色了

442
00:31:51,995 --> 00:31:54,623
Erlynne, 对了，她有了一些进项
Erlynne, that's right.She came into some money.

443
00:31:54,998 --> 00:31:58,293

- I made an investment for her.- An inheritance, I suppose?

444
00:31:59,837 --> 00:32:02,339
商店里的女人，我告诉过你的，记得吗?

00:32:04,591 --> 00:32:07,302
不，后背，几乎没有前片你什么都能看见
No, back and almost no front.You could see everything.

447
00:32:07,511 --> 00:32:08,804
很不像样
It was indecent.

448
00:32:09,137 --> 00:32:10,889
你只是不习惯意大利时装而已
You're just not used toItalian fashions, that's all.

449
00:32:11,139 --> 00:32:12,850
我觉得你妻子挺合拍的
No, I'm sure your wife ison the mark.

450
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:15,686
Erlynne太太是个声名狼藉的无耻女人
Mrs Erlynne is anotorious Jezebel.

451
00:32:16,103 --> 00:32:18,564
那是诽谤，如果你不收回，我不会重复
That's a slanderous statement. If youcan't back it up, I wouldn't repeat it.

452
00:32:19,606 --> 00:32:22,109
Robert总是给不随便评价他人的
Robert always gives everybodythe benefit of the doubt.

453
00:32:22,693 --> 00:32:24,778
对不起，我只是不喜欢流言
I'm sorry, I just don't like gossip.

454
00:32:24,945 --> 00:32:27,906
流言没什么，这是口味低下的布道
Gossip's all right, it's themoralising that's in poor taste.

455
00:32:30,117 --> 00:32:32,578
她看上我了，你该懂我意思
She's got her eye on me,if you know what I mean.

456
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:35,164
所以我根本不担心他们说什么不过是囊中之物吧了
So I wouldn't worry about what theysay, it's all cats in a bag.

457
00:32:36,999 --> 00:32:39,001
怎么了，他们怎么说我的？

一个厚颜无耻的女人，哦，我的天啊

461
00:32:46,466 --> 00:32:49,178
由我陪伴的你才真是厚颜无耻呢
You're very brazen yourselfto be seen in my company.

462
00:32:49,386 --> 00:32:50,971
我也有个复杂的背景啊

无论你怎么讲究婚姻都肯定是有价值的

当人们讲究经历的时候...

467
00:33:01,231 --> 00:33:02,816
他们多半说的是错误

468
00:33:03,108 --> 00:33:04,735
我无任同意
I couldn't agree more.

469
00:33:04,943 --> 00:33:06,778
我们都在储藏间里藏着几具骷髅
We've all got a couple ofskeletons in the closet.

470
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:09,239
如果他们要喋喋不休还不如干脆跳舞
If they're going to rattle,they may as well dance.

471
00:33:09,698 --> 00:33:11,158
你完全正确

只要有人赞同我我一定错了

473
00:33:15,746 --> 00:33:17,748
你喜欢作最后一个剩下的人，是吧?

我从来就不能理解女人

475
00:33:20,417 --> 00:33:23,128
女人不需要人理解，只需要人爱

476
00:33:23,629 --> 00:33:25,339
你这就大错了

477

你真善解人意

478
00:33:29,468 --> 00:33:31,678
戴丁香花的女人，你认识吗?

Look, it's terribly stuffy in here,I can hardly breathe.

我们走吧，你介意吗？
Shall we go? Would you mind?

我根本一点都不介意

我叫个出租车吧?

- It's the key to happiness.- Do you really think so?

绝对是，健康，很重要...
Absolutely. Good health,it's important, but...

00:34:54,678 --> 00:34:57,681
无知是钥匙，太多知识你就被限制住了

502
00:35:08,775 --> 00:35:10,444

- I love you.- I love you, too.

536
00:37:49,728 --> 00:37:51,230
哦，天啊
Oh, my!

537
00:37:54,525 --> 00:37:56,360
- 谢谢- 别提了
- Thank you.- Don't mention it.

538
00:38:05,202 --> 00:38:07,204
你喜欢吗?
You like it?

539
00:38:08,831 --> 00:38:10,582
食物是岩石...
Food is the rock...

540
00:38:10,999 --> 00:38:12,835
由我们创造
on which we build.

541
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:17,840
没有爱象食物一样纯洁而简单
No love is pure and simpleas the love of food.

542
00:38:18,048 --> 00:38:20,092
爱少有纯洁，Augustus大人而且从不简单
Love is rarely pure, Lord Augustus.And never simple.

543
00:38:21,593 --> 00:38:23,679
我不认为你曾爱过，Erlynne太太
I don't think you've beenin love, Mrs Erlynne.

544
00:38:24,847 --> 00:38:26,849
你可以假称我Stella...
You may presumeto call me Stella...

545
00:38:27,015 --> 00:38:28,851
但别假装你知道我的心
but don't presumeto know my heart.

546
00:38:29,017 --> 00:38:31,353
根据你的情报，我永远都在恋爱
For your information,I'm always in love.

547
00:38:32,062 --> 00:38:35,399
好，出色的态度，而且你很美
Good. Excellent attitude.And you're beautiful.

548
00:38:36,525 --> 00:38:38,777
也精明，比我精明，我希望……
Smart, too. Smarter than me,I expect, but...

549
00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:40,863
希望没说太多
that's not saying much,I'm afraid.

550
00:38:41,613 --> 00:38:43,365
不，我觉得如果跟你结婚我会很好的
No, I think I'll do very wellto marry you.

551
00:38:45,075 --> 00:38:46,702
多实际啊
How very practical.

552
00:38:46,952 --> 00:38:49,746
我开始过太多不涉及情感的浪漫了
I've begun too many romancesout of sentiment.

553
00:38:50,747 --> 00:38:52,583
最终都以结算为结局
They always end in settlement.

554
00:38:52,916 --> 00:38:54,877
我可以整夜听你倾诉Augustus大人
I could listen to you all night,Lord Augustus.

555
00:38:55,419 --> 00:38:57,212
请叫我Tuppy
Tuppy, please.

556
00:38:59,131 --> 00:39:01,341
你会考虑我的提议吗?
You'll think about my offer?

557
00:39:02,968 --> 00:39:05,179
男人不跟我这样的女人结婚的
Men don't marry women like me.

558
00:39:06,096 --> 00:39:07,973
那是因为没有你这样的女人
There aren't any women like you.

559
00:39:08,307 --> 00:39:11,393
至少我认识的人里面没有我遇到可以分享的了
At least, not among the womenI've met, and I've met my share.

560
00:39:11,727 --> 00:39:14,897
我曾结婚，但不喜欢
I was married - I didn't take to it.

561
00:39:15,397 --> 00:39:18,483
人会变，你会感受到不同的
People change. You mightfeel differently.

562
00:39:19,735 --> 00:39:21,570
当我想到的时候我想到
When I think of it, I thinkof a room...

563
00:39:22,154 --> 00:39:24,114
一个不能开窗的房间
where you can't open a window.

564
00:39:25,782 --> 00:39:27,910
因为没有窗户
Where there is no window.

565
00:39:29,495 --> 00:39:31,705
每天醒来，你发现房间又变小了
Every day you wake upand the room is smaller.

566
00:39:33,916 --> 00:39:37,336
你不会注意，开始不会逐渐发生
You don't notice, not at first.It happens slowly.

567
00:39:38,253 --> 00:39:40,255
一点点的
In inches.

568
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:43,258
然后某天早晨你睁眼发现...
Then one morning,you open your eyes...

569
00:39:44,801 --> 00:39:46,970
房间已经小的...
and the room is so small...

570
00:39:48,138 --> 00:39:49,765
你无法腾挪了
you can't move.

571
00:39:51,016 --> 00:39:52,935
无法呼吸
You can't take a breath.

572
00:39:54,394 --> 00:39:55,979
你不得不逃走
You have to get out.

573
00:39:57,814 --> 00:39:59,983
你什么事都无法想
You can't think of anything else.

574
00:40:00,526 --> 00:40:02,069
什么人都无法想
Or anyone else.

575
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:05,572
你只是嫁错了人
You married the wrong man,that's all.

576
00:40:09,451 --> 00:40:11,370
他娶错了人
He married the wrong woman.

577
00:40:13,539 --> 00:40:14,957
很晚了
It's late.

578
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:17,584
该上床了
It's time for bed.

579
00:40:18,335 --> 00:40:19,628
睡觉
Sleep.

580
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,672
"偶然的梦境"
"...Perchance to dream".

581
00:40:22,047 --> 00:40:24,299
是吟游诗人，你知道我自己也读过点书的
That's the bard, you know.I'm a bit of a reader myself.

582
00:40:24,508 --> 00:40:26,593
照你说的，晚安，Tuppy
So you said. Goodnight, Tuppy.

583
00:40:30,681 --> 00:40:32,641
我讨厌烟草味
I hate the taste of tobacco.

584
00:40:37,187 --> 00:40:38,689
好，就这样
Well - that's it then.

585
00:40:45,821 --> 00:40:48,699
我戒了，当场
I quit. On the spot.

586
00:40:52,077 --> 00:40:54,079
我还能告诉你什么?
What else can I tell you?

587
00:40:56,081 --> 00:40:58,000
我是个非常富有的人，你知道
I'm a very rich man, you know.

588
00:40:59,251 --> 00:41:01,128
你是个非常好的人
You're a very nice man.

589
00:41:01,962 --> 00:41:03,255
上床吧
Go to bed.

590
00:41:08,468 --> 00:41:10,554
你知道，我很高兴戒烟了
You know, I'm glad I quit.

591
00:41:12,764 --> 00:41:14,433
肮脏的习惯，真的
Filthy habit, really.

592
00:41:18,687 --> 00:41:20,314
晚安
Goodnight.

593
00:41:55,098 --> 00:41:57,893
是驯狮人或只是普通的小丑?
Is there going to be a lion tamer,or is it just the usual clowns?

594
00:41:58,143 --> 00:42:00,938
Robert害怕会下雨呢
Robert was afraid it might rain.

595
00:42:01,104 --> 00:42:04,024
我本来只想几个人吃饭但他说你一生只得一次21岁
I just wanted a few people for dinnerbut he said you are only 21 once.

596
00:42:04,274 --> 00:42:07,069
我认识很多女人，按照她们的记录年年都过35
I know plenty of women who, of theirown accord, turn 35 year after year.

597
00:42:07,486 --> 00:42:09,738
我肯定你可以21岁很多年
I'm sure you can be 21 as many times.

598
00:42:10,072 --> 00:42:11,865
我觉得对于岁数撒谎很蠢
I think it's silly to lie about your age.

599
00:42:12,115 --> 00:42:14,660
- 你没有补偿的恶习- 我希望没有
- You have no redeeming vices.- I hope not.

600
00:42:16,245 --> 00:42:18,038
生日快乐
Happy Birthday.

601
00:42:19,122 --> 00:42:21,333
邀请信上写了不要礼物
The invitation said no gifts.

602
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:23,335
所以我现在把它带来了
That's why I brought it now.

603
00:42:27,798 --> 00:42:30,884
这太贵了，我知道你没什么意思...
It's too expensive. I know youdon't mean anything by it, but...

604
00:42:31,134 --> 00:42:32,427
但看上去不对
it wouldn't look right.

605
00:42:32,636 --> 00:42:34,429
金子衬什么都行，戴上就是了不需要人知道
Gold looks right with everything.Just wear it. No-one has to know.

606
00:42:34,596 --> 00:42:37,140
我知道
I'd know.

607
00:42:38,475 --> 00:42:40,102
我可意味深长
I do mean something by it.

608
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:42,104
- 拜托...- 这是友谊的礼物, Maggie
- Please...- It's a gift of friendship, Maggie.

609
00:42:42,271 --> 00:42:44,439
如果你拒绝就太伤我了
You'll hurt me deeply if you refuse.

610
00:42:45,524 --> 00:42:46,942
看看你现在逼的我
Now look what you've made me do.

611
00:42:47,276 --> 00:42:49,111
一点真诚会成为很危险的事
A little sincerity can be a verydangerous thing.

612
00:42:49,319 --> 00:42:50,737
再来点就致命了
Any more could be fatal.

613
00:42:50,946 --> 00:42:52,906
在我死在你露台上前赶紧把这该死的玩艺接过去吧
Just take the damn thing beforeI die and ruin your terrace.

614
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:58,620
很美，谢谢你
It's very pretty. Thank you.

615
00:43:02,958 --> 00:43:05,169
Robert在哪? 又发电报去了吗？
Where's Robert? Off sendinganother telegram?

616
00:43:06,837 --> 00:43:09,423
女主人，花匠在等着拿工钱
Signora, the florist is waitingfor his money.

617
00:43:09,673 --> 00:43:11,258
我得跟Windemere先生拿
I'll have to get it fromMr Windemere.

618
00:43:11,425 --> 00:43:12,885
他能呆会儿再来吗?
Can he come back later?

619
00:43:13,093 --> 00:43:14,887
Robert 在办公室不是有支票本吗？
Has Robert a cheque-bookin his office?

620
00:43:15,053 --> 00:43:16,930
- 你能在账户签单吗?- 啊，是的，当然
- Can you sign on the account?- Ah, yes, of course.

621
00:43:17,097 --> 00:43:19,349
让他等一下我们今晚见了
Tell him to wait.I'll see you tonight.

622
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:21,768
人们并不总象我们希望的那样守规矩
People don't always behavethe way we expect.

623
00:43:22,728 --> 00:43:25,939
其实正相反，事实是我不希望看到你受伤
Just the opposite. The truth is Idon't want to see you hurt.

624
00:43:26,231 --> 00:43:28,108
你说什么呢?
What are you talking about?

625
00:43:28,317 --> 00:43:29,651
这些日子你或许需要个朋友
You may need a friendone of these days.

626
00:43:30,235 --> 00:43:33,030
当你需要的时候，我在这里你会记得吗?
When you do, I'm here.Will you remember that?

627
00:43:33,822 --> 00:43:35,365
是，当然
Yes, of course.

628
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:18,927
我尽快赶来了
I came as quickly as I could.

629
00:45:19,511 --> 00:45:22,306
我们都很悲伤
We're all so distressed over it.

630
00:45:23,891 --> 00:45:26,185
可你不该太责备自己了
But you mustn't take it personally.

631
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,479
Erlynne太太是那种...
Mrs Erlynne is one ofthose women...

632
00:45:29,813 --> 00:45:33,567
火焰吸引蜜蜂一样吸引男人的女人
that attract men like abee to a flame.

633
00:45:34,818 --> 00:45:38,113
- 是飞蛾- 飞蛾吸引蜜蜂
- A moth.- Bee to a moth.

634
00:45:41,867 --> 00:45:44,203
一定有其他解释
There must be someother explanation.

635
00:45:51,543 --> 00:45:54,630
我有个主意－咱们去散步好吗?
I have an idea - shallwe go for a walk?

636
00:46:03,138 --> 00:46:05,474
当婚姻没有爱时会有无婚姻的爱
When there's marriage without love,there'll be love without marriage.

637
00:46:05,766 --> 00:46:08,393
但Robert和我是因爱而结合的...
But Robert and I marriedfor love...

638
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:11,313
当然，我也曾是的
Of course. And so did I.

639
00:46:12,147 --> 00:46:13,982
但当热情逝去后...
But before the year was over...

640
00:46:14,191 --> 00:46:16,485
Benito开始摆弄各式衬裙
Benito was lifting all kindsof petticoats.

641
00:46:16,985 --> 00:46:19,238
我不得已辞去了最好的女佣
I had to dismiss my best maid.

642
00:46:19,822 --> 00:46:21,365
不，我想起来了
No, no, I remember.

643
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:23,575
我把她送给了我的表亲
I passed her on tomy cousin.

644
00:46:24,493 --> 00:46:26,537
她丈夫很短视，我觉得
Her husband was soshort-sighted, I thought.

645
00:46:27,788 --> 00:46:29,998
他好像是循着气味查的
But he navigated by scent,it seems.

646
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:33,335
真不幸
So unfortunate.

647
00:46:34,044 --> 00:46:36,713
相信我，这我们都经历过
Believe me, darling,it happens to us all.

648
00:46:37,381 --> 00:46:39,633
不死的爱就象你别墅里的鬼魂
Undying love is like theghost in your villa.

649
00:46:39,883 --> 00:46:41,093
人们都谈论...
Everybody talks about it...

650
00:46:41,301 --> 00:46:43,679
但试试去找一个得到的人吧
but try and find one personwho has seen it.

651
00:46:49,226 --> 00:46:51,645
- 你能帮我个忙吗?- 任何事
- Can I ask you a favour?- Anything at all.

652
00:46:52,938 --> 00:46:54,690
关于Erlynne太太...
About, Mrs Erlynne...

653
00:46:55,858 --> 00:46:57,568
很聪明的女人
Very clever woman.

654
00:46:57,776 --> 00:46:59,486
她昨晚把我扔出来了
She threw me out last night.

655
00:46:59,695 --> 00:47:01,947
知道了我有多蠢知道的跟我自己一样清楚
Knows what a fool I am.Knows it as well as I do myself.

656
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:04,658
她会在这跟我碰面喝茶
She's meeting me herefor tea, though.

657
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:11,999
能跟一个完全理解我的女人走到一起真是太棒了
It's a great thing to come across awoman who thoroughly understands me.

658
00:47:12,499 --> 00:47:15,669
今晚别带她到我们的舞会你会介意吗?
Would you mind not bringingher to our party tonight?

659
00:47:17,004 --> 00:47:18,672
这是你要的帮忙吗?
That's the favour?

660
00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:20,716
Meg 觉得那样会使事情变的不舒服
Meg feels it might makethings awkward.

661
00:47:20,966 --> 00:47:22,593
那么是真的喽?
So it's true, then?

662
00:47:22,801 --> 00:47:26,013
我不相信，你不是那个类型
I don't believe it.You don't seem the type.

663
00:47:26,555 --> 00:47:28,974
尽管我会说Erlynne太太实在迷人难以抗拒，但是……
Though I will say Mrs Erlynne's damnfascinating. Hard to resist, but...

664
00:47:32,311 --> 00:47:34,396
你不是认真的，对吧?
You're not serious, are you?

665
00:47:34,438 --> 00:47:37,024
我警告你，你得跟我决斗才能抢她
I warn you, you'll have tofight me for her.

666
00:47:37,274 --> 00:47:38,942
而我可是个坠入爱河的男人
And I'm a man in love.

667
00:47:39,735 --> 00:47:41,987
你说什么呢?
What are you talking about?

668
00:47:43,739 --> 00:47:45,407
这边请，Erlynne太太
This ways, Mrs Erlynne.

669
00:47:45,699 --> 00:47:47,284

672

我要见Augustos大人

673
00:48:01,632 --> 00:48:03,383
你马上得离开Amalfi

674
00:48:03,509 --> 00:48:07,304
去哪?你已经替我付了一个季的租金
And go where? You've paid myrent here for the season.

675
00:48:07,596 --> 00:48:09,765
我会付其他地方的帐我要你上明天第一班飞机
I'll pay it somewhere else. I wantyou on the first plane out tomorrow.

676
00:48:10,057 --> 00:48:12,309

我们
About us.

678
00:48:15,854 --> 00:48:17,439
我不觉得可笑
I don't see the humour.

679
00:48:17,731 --> 00:48:21,944
在这里，埋葬一个秘密会冒出另一个假的吗？
Bury a real secret anda false one pops up in its place?

680
00:48:22,444 --> 00:48:24,738
你得承认确实这么荒谬
There's a certain irony,you have to admit.

681
00:48:26,657 --> 00:48:29,201
我不想走，在这挺高兴的
I'm not ready to leave.I'm enjoying myself here.

682
00:48:29,409 --> 00:48:30,994
我恳求你
I'm begging you.

683
00:48:31,703 --> 00:48:35,123
想想Meg，如果她知道你是她妈妈...
Think of Meg. If she knew thatyou were her mother...

684
00:48:37,751 --> 00:48:39,127
那会毁灭她的
it would destroy her.

685
00:48:39,419 --> 00:48:41,463
Meg, 高尚的Windemeres?
Meg, of the magnificentWindemeres?

686
00:48:41,672 --> 00:48:44,383
家族丑闻对一个有抱负的政治家是不健康的
Family scandal is unhealthyfor aspiring politicians.

687
00:48:44,508 --> 00:48:46,468
我不是这屋里唯一一个爱管闲事的人
I'm not the only pragmatistin this room.

688
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:51,765
爱管闲事? 20年，音讯全无
Pragmatist? Twenty years,and not a word.

689
00:48:51,974 --> 00:48:54,309
当她嫁入豪门时你倒出现了
You turn up when she marriesa man with money.

690
00:48:54,476 --> 00:48:57,062
你管那叫爱管闲事？我有更好的形容方法
You call that pragmatism?I can think of other words.

691
00:48:57,271 --> 00:48:59,106
你想伤害我的感情吗?
Are you trying to hurtmy feelings?

692
00:48:59,273 --> 00:49:02,067
你有感情吗？那是不能买卖的
Do you have any? That can'tbe purchased, I mean.

693
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:06,488
多少钱，能让你坐上头班机走开?
How much - to get youon the first flight out?

694
00:49:11,201 --> 00:49:13,662
我觉得每次他吻我都是不洁的
I feel every time he'skissed me it's filthy.

695
00:49:14,454 --> 00:49:16,582
我们在一起的每分钟都是谎言
A lie, every minute we'vebeen together.

696
00:49:19,334 --> 00:49:20,794
他怎么能呢?
How could he?

697
00:49:21,378 --> 00:49:24,173
每个男人生来都说实话但死时都是骗子
Every man is born truthfuland every man dies a liar.

698
00:49:25,716 --> 00:49:28,385
现在，无论你做什么都不能引人注目
Now, whatever you do, youmustn't make a scene.

699
00:49:28,594 --> 00:49:30,637
太令人不快而且也浪费你的精力
It's too unpleasant.And you waste your energy.

700
00:49:32,764 --> 00:49:34,308
当然不会
No, of course not. I wouldn't.

701
00:49:34,933 --> 00:49:37,227
哭是平庸女人的庇护所
Crying is the refugeof plain women.

702
00:49:38,729 --> 00:49:40,564
漂亮女人去购物
Pretty women go shopping.

703
00:49:53,452 --> 00:49:56,121
上那班飞机我会把现金奉上

704
00:50:06,256 --> 00:50:08,383
我没听错吧?

705
00:50:08,592 --> 00:50:11,762
Meg Windemere 是你的女儿?
That Meg Windemere isyour daughter?

706
00:50:12,554 --> 00:50:14,223
我女儿?

00:50:14,473 --> 00:50:16,266
Robert的妻子?

她至少有20岁了，她的妈妈?

710
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,526
我真的看上去有那么老吗?
Do I look as old as all that?

711
00:50:28,111 --> 00:50:29,112
当然不是
Of course not.

712
00:50:30,531 --> 00:50:33,408
我一定是在打盹
I must have nodded off.

713
00:50:34,117 --> 00:50:36,787
你困了，回去接着睡吧
You were dozing.Go back to sleep.

714
00:50:48,006 --> 00:50:49,591
快点

我猜也是，尽管是个闷人的季节是吧？
I suppose so. It's been a very dullseason, though, hasn't it?

肯定不是，至少还会有两个

我今天做了个怪透了的梦

刚刚想起了一小部分...

733
00:52:28,565 --> 00:52:30,275
如果你想享受她们...

734
00:52:30,484 --> 00:52:32,194
千万别看过程

00:53:46,685 --> 00:53:49,313
- 那是新的吗?- 刚出盒，你喜欢吗?
- Is that new?- Just out of the box. Do you like it?

00:53:49,771 --> 00:53:51,732
你会有点冷，我给你拿个披肩吧
You might be a little cold.I'll get you a wrap.

737
00:53:52,107 --> 00:53:55,110
毁掉线条吗，你朋友没教你意大利时装吗?
And spoil the lines? Didn't your friendteach you about Italian fashion?

738
00:53:55,444 --> 00:53:56,862
我朋友?
My friend?

739
00:53:57,112 --> 00:53:59,239
我看见支票了，少来...

740
00:53:59,531 --> 00:54:01,450
Plymdale女士, 你来真好

再要一杯香槟吗?

我俩都来点吧

743
00:54:07,164 --> 00:54:08,957
你怎么给我问安?
Why don't you ask me how I am?

744
00:54:09,166 --> 00:54:11,084
我喜欢人给我问安
I like people to ask.

745
00:54:11,335 --> 00:54:13,170
表示对我健康的普遍关心
It shows a widespreadinterest in my health.

746
00:54:13,337 --> 00:54:15,464
你不会知道那让人多舒服
And you can't imagine howcomforting that is.

747
00:54:17,007 --> 00:54:18,800
晚会不错

748
00:54:18,926 --> 00:54:20,636
- 你好, Cecil?- 一点都不好
- How are you, Cecil?- Oh, not well at all.

749
00:54:21,345 --> 00:54:23,305

跟Windemere先生走谢谢
Go with Mr Windemere.Thank you.

753
00:54:32,272 --> 00:54:35,234
她是我最小的，我会想她的
She's my last, you know.I will miss her.

754
00:54:35,526 --> 00:54:37,986
但是在她们开始攻击你之前...
But it's best to get them outof the nest...

755
00:54:38,153 --> 00:54:40,155
还是把她们从巢里赶走吧
before they turn on you.

756
00:54:40,322 --> 00:54:43,408
女孩最初是爱妈妈的但长大后就会评价你
Girls begin by loving their mothers.But as they grow they judge us.

757
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:46,161
很少会宽容
Rarely do they forgive us.

758
00:54:49,498 --> 00:54:52,459
哦，可怜的傻子就是学不会

Tuppy,he's brought Mrs Erlynne.

761
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:00,175
所有女人都会怠慢她
All the women will snub her.

762
00:55:00,551 --> 00:55:02,761
她跟男人在一起没准会有点运气
She may have betterluck with the men.

763
00:55:03,011 --> 00:55:04,555
那是因为男人...
It is because of men...

764
00:55:04,805 --> 00:55:07,015
女人才不信任女人
that women distrust other women.

765
00:55:07,182 --> 00:55:08,684
女人不信女人,男人也不信女人...
Women don't trust women,men don't trust women...

766
00:55:08,851 --> 00:55:11,770
没人相信女人
no-one trusts women.

767
00:55:12,062 --> 00:55:14,439
就是这个联合了印度教和天主教
It's what binds the Hinduand the Catholic.

768
00:55:25,576 --> 00:55:28,537
我知道我发过誓但我必需说你今晚真美
I know I promised, but I must tellyou how beautiful you look tonight.

769
00:55:29,913 --> 00:55:32,416
好吧，如果你非说就说吧
Well, if you must, you must.

770
00:55:33,542 --> 00:55:36,128
请原谅，我在找其他人
I beg your pardon, I waslooking for someone else.

771
00:55:36,378 --> 00:55:38,338
而你找到了我

772
00:55:38,714 --> 00:55:40,340
Erlynne太太
Mrs Erlynne.

773
00:55:40,591 --> 00:55:42,259
我可以叫你Stella吗？

774
00:55:42,843 --> 00:55:45,137
Augustus大人给我拿香槟去了
Lord Augustus is gettingme champagne.

775
00:55:45,429 --> 00:55:47,514
你和我可以交换恩宠
You and I can trade favours.

776
00:55:47,931 --> 00:55:49,725
很诱人，但算了
Tempting, but no.

777
00:55:50,142 --> 00:55:53,729
我宁愿他不会看到月光下的我们或许会令他误解
I'd rather he didn't see us under themoonlight. He might misunderstand.

778
00:55:54,188 --> 00:55:55,814
听我说
Hear me out.

779
00:55:56,064 --> 00:55:58,233
Windemere财富胜过Tuppy
Windemere's fortune exceeds Tuppy's.

780
00:55:58,525 --> 00:55:59,693
干嘛现在换马?
Why change horses now?

781
00:55:59,943 --> 00:56:02,070
你得到所要的，Meg也自由了
You can have waht youwant and Meg's free.

782
00:56:02,946 --> 00:56:04,364
自由?
Free?

783
00:56:04,573 --> 00:56:06,533
她没有离开他的勇气
She hasn't the courage to leave him.

784
00:56:06,783 --> 00:56:08,869
但如果明确了他跟你在一起...
But if it's clear to her thathe's with you...

785
00:56:09,203 --> 00:56:11,205
他没有
He's not.

786
00:56:11,622 --> 00:56:15,417
你买的谣言不可靠，赶紧去退款吧
You've been buying idle gossip.You should get a refund.

787
00:56:16,793 --> 00:56:18,420
请原谅
Excuse me.

788
00:56:18,921 --> 00:56:21,131
我非邀请她不可, Dumby
I had to invite her, Dumby.

789
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:24,426
问题是，她变了你可以从她眼睛里看出来
The point is, she's a changed woman.You can see it in her eyes.

790
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:27,095
你以为你要是穷她会看你一眼吗?
Do you think she'd look atyou if you were poor?

791
00:56:27,304 --> 00:56:29,014
那你以为如果她丑我会看她吗?
Do you think I'd look at herif she were ugly?

792
00:56:29,264 --> 00:56:31,475
公平是公平，互利互惠
Fair's fair, exchange ratesand so forth.

793
00:56:31,975 --> 00:56:33,769
我知道她有点这有点那...
I know she's had her thisand her that, but...

794
00:56:33,977 --> 00:56:36,271
但如果男人能有过去...
if a man can toleratehis own past...

795
00:56:36,647 --> 00:56:38,982
他妻子干嘛不能有?而且肯出钱...
Why not a past in his wife?At any rate...

796
00:56:39,399 --> 00:56:41,819
什么都能擦干净重新开始
it's wipe the slate.Clean start.

797
00:56:41,985 --> 00:56:44,947
她和我……我们可以互相理解
She and I, we...understand each other.

798
00:56:45,864 --> 00:56:47,366
你知道他们怎么说
And you know what they say.

799
00:56:47,574 --> 00:56:50,577
每个圣人都有个过去而每个罪人都有个未来
Every saint has past,every sinner has a future.

800
00:56:55,290 --> 00:56:57,376
如果她肯要，我想向她求婚
I'm going to ask her to marryme if she'll have me.

801
00:56:58,669 --> 00:57:01,964
你知道人们为什么称之为圣坛, Tuppy?
You know why they call itan altar, Tuppy?

802
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:05,509
因为那里以人为祭祀
It's where they makehuman sacrifices.

803
00:57:06,885 --> 00:57:09,513
我今天梦到 Erlynne太太
I had a dream aboutMrs Erlynne today.

804
00:57:10,848 --> 00:57:11,682
是吗...
Yes, well...

805
00:57:11,849 --> 00:57:13,809
你是情不自禁吧...
you couldn't help it,I suppose. She...

806
00:57:14,935 --> 00:57:16,436
她真了不起
she is quite the woman.

807
00:57:17,396 --> 00:57:19,648
但以后……
But in future...

808
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,317
还是请梦别人去吧
please try to dream ofsomeone else.

809
00:57:46,133 --> 00:57:48,260
你不觉得自己喝够了吗?
Don't you think you'vehad enough?

810
00:58:03,734 --> 00:58:06,320
- 晚会很好- 谢谢赏光
- Lovely party.- Thanks for coming.

811
00:58:09,865 --> 00:58:11,158
Meg?
Meg?

812
00:58:11,492 --> 00:58:13,327
我得去换衣服

813
00:58:13,535 --> 00:58:15,454
- 你看见她了吗?- 没有
- Did you see her?- Don't.

814
00:58:15,954 --> 00:58:17,706
你很可爱
You're lovely.

815
00:58:17,915 --> 00:58:20,167
她那岁数的女人穿真荒唐
It's ridiculous on a woman at her age.

816
00:58:21,043 --> 00:58:22,920
你干嘛不告诉我?
Why didn't you tell me?

817
00:58:23,837 --> 00:58:25,839
你说过你是我的朋友
You said you were my friend.

818
00:58:26,381 --> 00:58:28,300
男女之间无法成朋友
Men and women can't be friends.

819
00:58:33,222 --> 00:58:34,556
- Meg?- 不

820
00:58:55,077 --> 00:58:57,788
你能跟他在一起吗?

你今晚能跟他上床吗?
Can you get into bedwith him tonight?

822
00:59:01,959 --> 00:59:04,545
明晚?以后呢？
Tomorrow night?Nights after that?

823
00:59:05,879 --> 00:59:09,049
你自己说的，男人背叛妻子不可原谅
You said yourself, there's noforgiving a man who betrays his wife.

824
00:59:09,299 --> 00:59:10,342
你怎么选?
What will you choose?

825
00:59:10,509 --> 00:59:13,095
一个虚伪可耻的婚姻还是一个没有妥协的真我？
A false degrading marriage, or yourown true self, free of compromise?

826
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:16,223
我对你一见钟情，这是真的
I've loved you from the beginning.It's the truth.

827
00:59:16,431 --> 00:59:19,226
你在手套店抽出手来的那刻我想“就是她了”
Moment you held out your hand to me inthe glove shop, I thought 'there she is".

828
00:59:19,768 --> 00:59:22,187
那时，我是否该不加停留的离去呢?
And then, suppose I'd walkedby without stopping?

829
00:59:23,564 --> 00:59:25,524
只那样一想
Just the thought of it.

830
00:59:26,108 --> 00:59:28,068
至今我从未爱过
I've never loved anyone until now.

831
00:59:28,318 --> 00:59:30,154
停
Stop.

832
00:59:40,164 --> 00:59:41,748
John?
John?

833
00:59:42,708 --> 00:59:44,918
对不起，我不想吓你
I'm sorry, I didn't meanto startle you.

834
00:59:45,252 --> 00:59:47,546
我在找Meg，你看见她了吗？
I'm looking for Meg. If you see her,it's important.

835
00:59:48,463 --> 00:59:50,132
你排队了吗?
Have you had a row?

836
00:59:51,717 --> 00:59:53,635
一个小舞会
A little misunderstanding.

837
00:59:54,678 --> 00:59:56,346
看看酒吧
Try the bar.

838
01:00:03,353 --> 01:00:05,522
Tuppy为她戒烟了
Tuppy's given up smokes for her.

839
01:00:05,814 --> 01:00:06,899
女人
Women.

840
01:00:07,191 --> 01:00:08,901
Women 给我们向上的灵感
Women inspire us to great things.

841
01:00:09,401 --> 01:00:11,487
却又不明所以地阻止我们实施
Then somehow prevent usfrom doing any of them.

842
01:00:11,945 --> 01:00:14,490
他向她求婚了

843
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:16,283
该是他第三次上圣坛了
It will be his third time up the aisle.

844
01:00:16,533 --> 01:00:19,161
希望是个制胜之举， Dumby
Hope trumps experience, Dumby.

845
01:00:19,369 --> 01:00:21,330
是人类竞争中上帝之玩笑而已
It's God's joke on the human race.

846
01:00:21,538 --> 01:00:24,041
他确信她已改过自新了
He's quite convinced she'schanged her spots.

847
01:00:24,666 --> 01:00:26,627
想把那变有趣吗?
Care to make it interesting?

848
01:00:27,211 --> 01:00:29,338
告诉你我是认真的了
I told you I was serious.

849
01:00:30,923 --> 01:00:33,133
没有人警告你该反对我吗?
Hasn't anyone warned youagainst me?

850
01:00:33,383 --> 01:00:35,219
哦，是的，所有人
Oh, yes. Everyone.

851
01:00:36,762 --> 01:00:38,388
把它拿开
Put it away.

852
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:41,141
你并不用马上就爱上我
Now, you don't have to loveme right away.

853
01:00:41,391 --> 01:00:43,352
想想钱

855
01:00:47,356 --> 01:00:49,316
我就被个叫花子栓住了
I'll be stuck with a pauper.

856
01:00:49,525 --> 01:00:50,943
另一个情形是...
On the other hand...

857
01:00:51,068 --> 01:00:52,736
我可能下礼拜二死在高尔夫球场……
I could drop dead on the golf coursenext Tuesday...

858
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:53,904
而你可就富裕了

859
01:00:53,904 --> 01:00:56,031
生命就是赌博, Stella

860
01:00:57,407 --> 01:00:59,368
我不知如何作答
I don't know what to say.

861
01:01:00,869 --> 01:01:02,704
人讲太多话
People say too much as it is.

862
01:01:26,103 --> 01:01:27,729
Windemere太太跟Erlynne太太...
Mrs Windemere andMrs Erlynne...

863
01:01:27,896 --> 01:01:30,274
看起来就跟母女是的，是吧?

他们穿着同样的衣服

865
01:01:32,943 --> 01:01:34,611
就是的

866
01:01:40,659 --> 01:01:42,536
跟我走吧

01:01:56,383 --> 01:01:58,427
这是你开玩笑的方式吗？

I know we said cash, so I'm raisingthe amount. I want you to leave now.

874
01:02:14,151 --> 01:02:16,236
我要是你会更小心的
I'd be more concernedif I were you.

875
01:02:16,487 --> 01:02:18,071
你不是我

876
01:02:18,322 --> 01:02:20,199
问题是我对我妻子说谎了...

877

而我很不在行

我和Stella Erlynne之间什么都没有

895

你怎么能那么想?

我不能老解释跟...

我丈夫让你来的
My husband sent you.

939
01:09:01,934 --> 01:09:04,353
你丈夫以为你喝了一瓶矿泉水...
Your husband thinks you'rein bed sleeping off...

940
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:06,605
已经睡了

941
01:09:07,898 --> 01:09:09,691
走吧
Let's go.

942
01:09:10,526 --> 01:09:12,694
他给我钱了，就这样
He gave me money,that's all.

943

我是家族的老朋友

944
01:09:14,905 --> 01:09:16,532
你以为我傻吗?
Do you think I'm stupid?

945
01:09:16,698 --> 01:09:18,659
嫁给了一个爱的人，又跟...
Married to man you loveand running off...

946
01:09:18,826 --> 01:09:22,079
一个国际花花公子离家?我以为你傻?
with an international playboy?Do I think you're stupid?

947
01:09:22,204 --> 01:09:23,539
这跟你无关
This is none of your business.

948
01:09:23,705 --> 01:09:25,415
你以为开衩变高了，我们可以投票...
You think because hems are higherand women can vote...

949
01:09:25,582 --> 01:09:27,584
一切就会为我们而改变吗?
that anything hasreally changed for us?

950
01:09:27,876 --> 01:09:30,295
朋友们会不跟你联系
Friends will stop calling.

951
01:09:30,587 --> 01:09:32,548
他会受邀回家，而你不会
He'll be invited into homesyou're not.

952
01:09:32,965 --> 01:09:34,550
你可以做到

953
01:09:35,592 --> 01:09:37,177
别吓比较
Don't compare yourself.

954
01:09:37,386 --> 01:09:39,721
无悔的生活需要准备和练习
It takes practice andskill to live without regret.

955
01:09:43,225 --> 01:09:45,644
一段婚姻需要你整个心灵
A marriage takesyour whole heart.

956
01:09:45,894 --> 01:09:49,356
自私的人做不到，但你不是
Selfish people can't pull it off,but you're not that.

957
01:09:49,648 --> 01:09:52,067
我们都失败了你也不会
You can succeed wherethe rest of us fail.

958
01:09:53,110 --> 01:09:56,155
- 我干嘛要信你?- 别信我，信他
- Why should I believe you?- Don't believe me, believe him.

959
01:09:56,738 --> 01:10:00,117
他对你是忠诚的，我以性命担保
He's been faithful to you,I'll swear it on my life.

960
01:10:00,367 --> 01:10:01,827
他让你撒谎
He told you to lie.

961
01:10:03,537 --> 01:10:05,414
他甚至不知道你在这
He doesn't evenknow you're here.

962
01:10:09,543 --> 01:10:11,545
他不必知道
He never has to know.

963
01:10:12,671 --> 01:10:14,423
你让我再撒谎吗?
You want me to lie again?

964
01:10:14,631 --> 01:10:16,592
我们间的一切都完了，我不能
Everything's spoiledbetween us. I can't.

965
01:10:17,259 --> 01:10:18,468
你怎么了?
What's happened to you?

966
01:10:18,635 --> 01:10:20,512
谁教你这么不能宽容?
Who taught you to be sounforgiving?

967
01:10:20,679 --> 01:10:22,598
你犯了个错，别再犯了
You made a mistake,don't make it worse.

968
01:10:22,806 --> 01:10:25,267
你对不完美的东西熟视无睹...
You shut your eyes to everythingthat isn't perfect...

969
01:10:25,434 --> 01:10:27,352
你被带向一个陷阱
you're just asking to fallinto a hole.

970
01:10:33,442 --> 01:10:35,027
好吧
Fine.

971
01:10:36,778 --> 01:10:38,322
去吧
Go ahead.

972
01:10:38,822 --> 01:10:40,491
放弃爱而选择傲慢和内疚吧
Step over love to pick uppride and guilt.

973
01:10:41,074 --> 01:10:44,745
真是20岁这一年里
What will that tradebe worth in a year?

974
01:10:45,704 --> 01:10:47,289
最赔了买卖了
In twenty?

975
01:11:04,681 --> 01:11:07,142
Darlington, 你的船非得这么大吗?
Darlington, does your boatreally have to be so big?

976
01:11:07,309 --> 01:11:09,353
你知道人们怎么议论有大船的男人吗？
You know what they say aboutmen with big boats.

977
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:12,231
- 我得回家了- 你得抽支雪茄，真的?
- I should be getting home.- You'll take a cigar, surely?

978
01:11:12,439 --> 01:11:15,150
我以为你放弃对好女人的爱了呢
I thought you'd quitfor the love of a good woman.

979
01:11:15,317 --> 01:11:18,862
好女人可不是 Erlynne太太的名字
Good woman isn't exactly themoniker I'd choose for Mrs Erlynne.

980
01:11:19,071 --> 01:11:21,490
你在暗示她是魔鬼的侍女吗？
You imply she'sthe devil's handmaiden.

981
01:11:21,657 --> 01:11:24,493
Dumby和我正为你的未来担忧呢
Dumby and I are just concernedfor your future.

982
01:11:24,785 --> 01:11:29,832
魔鬼般的女人是麻烦好女人又太闷了
Devilish women are a bother,and good ones are a bore.

983
01:11:30,165 --> 01:11:32,042
那是唯一的不同
That's the only difference.

984
01:11:32,251 --> 01:11:34,002
Erlynne太太即不是麻烦也不是沉闷
Mrs Erlynne is neither a bothernor a bore.

985
01:11:34,545 --> 01:11:37,339
你改变了习惯但我怀疑她也会改变
You change your habits,but I doubt she'll change hers.

986
01:11:37,798 --> 01:11:40,050
我跟 Dumby 赌了50块
I've bet Dumby fifty quid.

987
01:11:40,425 --> 01:11:41,844
够了
Enough of this.

988
01:11:42,010 --> 01:11:44,304
我不想听反对她的话了
I won't hear any more wordssaid against her.

989
01:11:44,513 --> 01:11:46,431
她是我对女人一切愿望的完美体现
She's everything I've everwanted in a woman.

990
01:11:46,974 --> 01:11:51,186
我亲爱的Tuppy,这世界上只有两个惨剧
My dear Tuppy, in this worldthere are only two tragedies.

991
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:54,356
一是一无所获，一是得偿所愿
One is not getting what one wants,the other is getting it.

992
01:11:54,565 --> 01:11:59,236
后者是最差的，真正的惨剧
The last is very much the worst.The last is a real tragedy.

993
01:12:00,112 --> 01:12:02,114
婚姻
Marriage.

994
01:12:02,281 --> 01:12:05,450
痛苦万分，问Edna
It has its pains - ask Edna.

995
01:12:06,702 --> 01:12:08,996
单身生活没乐趣
Celibacy has no pleasures.

996
01:12:09,454 --> 01:12:11,331
- 你怎么知道?- 我可以学
- What would you know about it?- I can learn.

997
01:12:11,373 --> 01:12:12,583
来证明我的爱
If it will prove my love.

998
01:12:12,708 --> 01:12:14,960
女人需要验证?
A woman who needs proof?

999
01:12:15,127 --> 01:12:16,587
在她离开她丈夫以前
Before she'll leave her husband.

1000
01:12:16,837 --> 01:12:19,214
John,你是个无赖
John, you are a cad.

1001
01:12:19,631 --> 01:12:21,592
我们都在臭水沟里
We're all in the gutter.

1002
01:12:21,884 --> 01:12:23,427
而我们中的一些人却在看星星
But some of us are looking at the stars.

1003
01:12:23,635 --> 01:12:25,679
男人称它为“殷勤”
What men call gallantry...

1004
01:12:26,430 --> 01:12:28,474
上帝称它为“通奸”
ans God's adultery...

1005
01:12:28,682 --> 01:12:32,686
这种事在天气闷热的地方，尤其容易发生
is far more common where the climate's sultry.

1006
01:12:34,855 --> 01:12:37,065
那是我买给Meg的
That's the one I bought Meg.

1007
01:12:39,067 --> 01:12:40,569
生日礼物
For her birthday.

1008
01:12:40,903 --> 01:12:42,613
你肯定吗?
Are you sure?

1009
01:12:43,071 --> 01:12:45,491
必是上次你来吃饭时她落在这的
She must have left it last weekwhen you came for lunch.

1010
01:12:45,741 --> 01:12:47,743
可她今晚拿着来着
She was carrying it tonight.

1011
01:12:47,993 --> 01:12:50,120
扇子彼此相象
One fan looks very muchlike another.

1012
01:12:50,204 --> 01:12:51,705
John?
John?

1013
01:12:52,873 --> 01:12:56,210
- 我不知道- Meg不是在这里吧?
- I've no idea.- Meg's not here, is she?

1014
01:12:57,711 --> 01:13:00,380
当然不是
No, of course not.

1015
01:13:02,257 --> 01:13:04,593
- 那是什么?- 我什么都没听见
- What's that?- I didn't hear anything.

1016
01:13:05,302 --> 01:13:06,887
她在楼下
She's downstairs.

1017
01:13:07,095 --> 01:13:08,472
冷静你喝太多了...
Calm down.You've had too much...

1018
01:13:09,932 --> 01:13:11,809
别让你自己出丑
Don't make an ass of yourself.

1019
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:14,102
太晚了
Too late.

1020
01:13:14,394 --> 01:13:16,313
- 该死- 你弄点冰敷上吧
- Bloody hell!- You better put some ice on that.

1021
01:13:23,904 --> 01:13:26,031
我以为是我的呢
I thought it was mine.

1022
01:13:26,532 --> 01:13:28,992
肯定是误拿了Windemere的
I must have picked upMrs Windemere's by mistake.

1023
01:13:42,047 --> 01:13:44,675
Tuppy, 我发誓，我不知道
Tuppy, I swear, I had no idea.

1024
01:13:53,809 --> 01:13:56,937
你欠Cecil 50磅，对不起
You owe Cecil fifty quid. Sorry.

1025
01:14:02,151 --> 01:14:05,571
好像是我出丑了Windemere，不是你
It seems I'm the ass,Windemere. Not you.

1026
01:15:16,558 --> 01:15:19,228
我在John船上过的夜
I spent the night on John's boat.

1027
01:15:22,272 --> 01:15:24,399
我喝多了
I had too much to drink.

1028
01:15:24,858 --> 01:15:26,860
你能原谅我吗?
Can I ask you to forgive me?

1029
01:15:29,071 --> 01:15:31,198
我昨夜做了很蠢的事
I did something very stupidlast night.

1030
01:15:36,245 --> 01:15:38,247
你不是我的同伙
You're not in my league.

1031
01:15:38,413 --> 01:15:40,165
我出了大丑
I made a complete ass of myself.

1032
01:15:40,374 --> 01:15:42,251
毁了Tuppy
Ruined it for poor Tuppy.

1033
01:15:42,417 --> 01:15:44,336
但我想这迟早会发生
Better now than later, I guess.

1034
01:15:44,503 --> 01:15:45,671
Tuppy?
Tuppy?

1035

他取消了向Erlynne太太求婚
His engagement toMrs Erlynne is off.

1036
01:15:51,093 --> 01:15:52,970
你说什么呢?
What are you talking about?

1037
01:15:53,137 --> 01:15:56,306
昨晚在John游艇上，Erlynne在他卧室里等他
Last night on John's yacht, MrsErlynne was waiting in his bedroom.

1038
01:15:57,933 --> 01:15:59,810
看，我喝多了，我以为...
Look, I was drunk, I thought...

1039
01:16:00,352 --> 01:16:02,020
我看见了你的扇子，我以为...
I saw your fan, I thought that...

1040
01:16:03,105 --> 01:16:04,648
我没用脑子
I didn't think.

1041
01:16:04,773 --> 01:16:06,024
是她

01:16:06,191 --> 01:16:07,943
她说是她误拿了

1043
01:16:08,152 --> 01:16:10,445
- 不，那不是事实- 当然不是
- No, that's not true.- Oh, of course not.

1044

最好数数勺子
Better count the spoons.

1045
01:16:13,115 --> 01:16:15,075
你不让她来是对的
You were rightnot to want her here.

1046
01:16:15,284 --> 01:16:17,327
我对John期望挺高的，Tuppy可是他的朋友啊
I'd have expected more from John,though. Tuppy's his friend.

1047
01:16:18,453 --> 01:16:21,248

有美国的电话

是你父亲，Windemere 先生

1052

一个女人送来这个

1055
01:16:56,533 --> 01:16:59,119
谢谢
Thank you.

1056
01:17:27,064 --> 01:17:30,442
你在这里干嘛?我们有协议

我回来还扇子

是我的秘密，不是你的

你保守的很好

20年是个很久的时间

没造成什么伤害

你看个小女孩...

1068

我不觉得你对她有感情

你做错了

你的麻烦，你来扛吧

I can't be responsiblefor ruining that.

你们相爱，这就是事实

她是我的守护天使

我的一生，都想象她那样

1108
01:20:27,411 --> 01:20:30,080
我确信她不想你以她为标准
I'm sure she wouldn't hold youto such a standard.

1109

她此时一定以我为耻

If we never look down, how canwe know who we are?

1112
