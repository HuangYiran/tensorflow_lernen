1
00:00:01,237 --> 00:00:03,694
Why would the President want to kill your wife?

2
00:00:03,694 --> 00:00:05,665
Her very existence is a threat to him.

3
00:00:05,665 --> 00:00:10,043
So, you're telling me, he's so afraid of a scandal that he would commit murder.

4
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:10,854
Yes.

5
00:00:12,336 --> 00:00:13,373
This is crazy.

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,663
And, assassinating him, how does that even help you get his bone marrow?

7
00:00:17,663 --> 00:00:19,718
It was the only way to get near him.

8
00:00:19,718 --> 00:00:24,359
I needed allies, resources, people inside the White House to help arrange all this.

9
00:00:24,971 --> 00:00:26,433
So, we went to Kincaid's enemies.

10
00:00:26,433 --> 00:00:30,957
They were willing to assist, on the condition that we guaranteed his death.

11
00:00:30,957 --> 00:00:35,391
And, what about your team? Archer, Sandrine...

12
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,216
They're what, hired guns? Do they know all this?

13
00:00:41,891 --> 00:00:45,030
- So you lie to them, too. - I told them what they need to know.

14
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,373
And I suggest you do the same with your family, especially Brian.

15
00:00:48,952 --> 00:00:50,572
Do you trust how he'll react?

16
00:00:51,203 --> 00:00:53,555
You are out of your mind.

17
00:00:53,555 --> 00:00:56,550
Innocent people are dead because of you.

18
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,597
I didn't want it to happen this way, but I'm in too deep.

19
00:01:02,831 --> 00:01:06,329
If I back out now, they'll get rid of me.

20
00:01:07,224 --> 00:01:11,367
And anybody else who's involved. My family.

21
00:01:13,214 --> 00:01:16,601
- And your family. - You're an FBI agent, you can make a deal.

22
00:01:16,601 --> 00:01:19,562
Go to the police, the prosecutors, there's a way out of this.

23
00:01:19,562 --> 00:01:20,978
There isn't.

24
00:01:21,725 --> 00:01:23,783
I can't stop this thing.

25
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:24,960
And neither can you.

26
00:01:27,644 --> 00:01:29,093
Well, I don't accept that.

27
00:01:33,489 --> 00:01:35,009
What if I go to the President?

28
00:01:35,577 --> 00:01:40,084
I'm meeting with his Chief of Staff tomorrow, I could tell him what's going on.

29
00:01:40,084 --> 00:01:41,350
I don't think so.

30
00:01:42,045 --> 00:01:45,229
The Chief of Staff just died of a heart attack an hour ago.

31
00:01:47,167 --> 00:01:50,285
The Chief of Staff, and now Hoffman's dead, too?

32
00:01:50,285 --> 00:01:51,751
Just saw it on the news.

33
00:01:51,751 --> 00:01:54,973
Police believe he was the victim of an attempted carjacking.

34
00:01:54,973 --> 00:01:58,363
Hoffman I can understand. He was getting too close to the truth.

35
00:01:58,363 --> 00:02:00,599
But Creasy? Why'd they take him out?

36
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:02,646
Creasy was never the boss.

37
00:02:02,646 --> 00:02:04,854
Maybe the people up the chain got cold feet.

38
00:02:04,854 --> 00:02:09,850
- Decided to shut down the operation. Eliminate loose ends. - If that's true, why aren't we dead?

39
00:02:11,388 --> 00:02:15,068
- The night's still young. - Hoffman's murder wasn't a coincidence.

40
00:02:15,622 --> 00:02:17,689
I just spoke to the guy, he knew what was going on.

41
00:02:17,689 --> 00:02:20,848
Duncan and his friends are nervous and they took him out.

42
00:02:20,848 --> 00:02:24,666
- It's possible. - "It's possible"?

43
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:27,660
Well, I don't think they would murder a federal agent.

44
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:31,391
What are you talking about? They just gunned down a teenager in our house.

45
00:02:31,391 --> 00:02:33,173
They'll do anything to get rid of the President.

46
00:02:33,173 --> 00:02:35,789
I have a feeling it's more complicated than that.

47
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:36,723
Why?

48
00:02:37,792 --> 00:02:41,713
I just do. I don't think they're terrorists.

49
00:02:41,713 --> 00:02:43,844
I think there's something else going on.

50
00:02:43,844 --> 00:02:47,309
This leaves us in a bad spot.
We don't know who we're dealing with anymore.

51
00:02:47,309 --> 00:02:49,144
Logan's our only partner now.

52
00:02:49,144 --> 00:02:51,773
Partner? I'm not so sure.

53
00:02:51,773 --> 00:02:55,426
I don't like the fact that he didn't give us a heads up about Hoffman.

54
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:57,050
Or Creasy.

55
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:59,484
- It's not a good sign. - I'm meeting him tomorrow.

56
00:03:00,279 --> 00:03:03,088
- I'll get some answers then. - Just watch your step.

57
00:03:05,274 --> 00:03:07,464
- Ellen figured it out. - Excuse me?

58
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:08,868
Nina.

59
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:13,309
Her relationship to the President. The bone marrow.

60
00:03:14,117 --> 00:03:17,171
The more people who know, the more complicated this becomes.

61
00:03:17,171 --> 00:03:18,356
She's smart.

62
00:03:19,837 --> 00:03:22,295
- She understands that. - I know she's smart.

63
00:03:22,295 --> 00:03:24,171
But will she keep her mouth shut?

64
00:03:25,094 --> 00:03:27,679
Do you know something that you're not telling me?

65
00:03:27,679 --> 00:03:30,847
- Like what? - I don't know. That's why I'm asking.

66
00:03:32,036 --> 00:03:34,334
Do you know why Duncan is doing this?

67
00:03:35,234 --> 00:03:38,434
No. I have no idea.

68
00:03:46,837 --> 00:03:48,819
One of my assistant's was there.

69
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:52,394
She saw it with her own eyes, said it was horrible.

70
00:03:53,453 --> 00:03:55,746
Gasping and convulsing...

71
00:03:56,777 --> 00:03:59,814
I can't even think about his poor wife and their little girl.

72
00:04:00,838 --> 00:04:02,208
It's tragic.

73
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,293
Yeah.

74
00:04:03,852 --> 00:04:06,219
I never cared for Quentin, but...

75
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,125
but any time a young man dies in the prime of his life...

76
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,259
Like Peter?

77
00:04:12,682 --> 00:04:13,878
Sort of.

78
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,255
What do you mean, "Sort of"?

79
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:20,793
The truth is, Peter was partially responsible for his own death.

80
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:23,846
You think it was Peter's fault that his plane crashed?

81
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:27,448
It was his fault that he thought he was invincible and could fly a plane

82
00:04:27,448 --> 00:04:30,930
over the Rockies, at night, after 20 straight hours of campaigning.

83
00:04:31,473 --> 00:04:34,930
Don't look at me like that. I loved him as much as you did.

84
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,718
For God's sake, I practically raised him.

85
00:04:37,718 --> 00:04:41,105
But that doesn't mean we shouldn't be honest about what happened.

86
00:04:41,105 --> 00:04:42,353
I agree.

87
00:04:42,353 --> 00:04:46,650
The way that my sister compartmentalizes, and rationalizes, it's...

88
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:51,343
It's infuriating. "Peter was too brash, so, he died. "

89
00:04:51,343 --> 00:04:53,461
There you go. As simple as that.

90
00:04:53,461 --> 00:04:55,498
Well, she didn't want to face the truth.

91
00:04:55,498 --> 00:04:59,212
It's just, I wanted to say to her, God, I wanted to tell her so badly,

92
00:04:59,212 --> 00:05:02,145
the reason Peter died is because your husband had him killed.

93
00:05:02,145 --> 00:05:04,983
Well, I'm glad you restrained yourself.

94
00:05:06,367 --> 00:05:07,187
Here.

95
00:05:08,161 --> 00:05:09,954
It wasn't easy, I swear.

96
00:05:12,054 --> 00:05:13,121
Don't worry.

97
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,106
He'll pay for what he did.

98
00:05:17,824 --> 00:05:18,867
He better.

99
00:05:19,467 --> 00:05:21,963
- Are you losing faith? - I'm losing patience.

100
00:05:22,664 --> 00:05:24,553
And confidence.

101
00:05:24,553 --> 00:05:27,284
I still have no idea if this doctor is going to come through

102
00:05:27,284 --> 00:05:30,162
or if the FBI agent is doing his job.

103
00:05:30,162 --> 00:05:31,686
Vanessa, what are you saying?

104
00:05:31,686 --> 00:05:34,669
I'm saying it's time for us to get more involved.

108
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:02,715
- I heard about our friend, Stan Hoffman. - Yeah. Sad. Another random act of violence.

109
00:06:02,715 --> 00:06:04,586
I thought we were going to take care of that together.

110
00:06:04,586 --> 00:06:06,917
Clock was ticking. Had to take care of it myself.

111
00:06:06,917 --> 00:06:07,727
Right.

112
00:06:08,313 --> 00:06:11,162
- So, do you have the OR schematics? - No, not yet.

113
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:13,342
Security plan isn't final yet.

114
00:06:13,342 --> 00:06:14,979
Surgery's in five days.

115
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,754
I'll see what I can do.

116
00:06:16,754 --> 00:06:20,625
My contact had a heart attack last night. Who do I talk to now?

117
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:23,360
Should I be insulted? You have me.

118
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:28,757
My deal was with Creasy. Not you.

119
00:06:28,757 --> 00:06:32,708
So, with all due respect, I need to know my side of this is being taken care of.

120
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:37,844
If they want to reach out to you, they will. Simple as that.

121
00:06:40,829 --> 00:06:42,351
Oh, one more thing.

122
00:06:43,211 --> 00:06:45,957
The five minute window you requested in the operating room?

123
00:06:45,957 --> 00:06:46,779
What about it?

124
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:49,949
- It's getting harder to make those arrangements. - That's non-negotiable.

125
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:52,811
Why do you need all that time?

126
00:06:52,811 --> 00:06:57,144
We made a deal. I expect you and your partners to honor it.

127
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,610
I'll let them know.

128
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,649
- I just talked to our friend at the FBI. - And?

129
00:07:14,649 --> 00:07:16,539
He wants direct contact with you.

130
00:07:18,086 --> 00:07:19,929
It's not gonna happen. He talks to you.

132
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,182
That's what I told him.

133
00:07:29,059 --> 00:07:30,592
I got his cell number. You ready?

134
00:07:31,299 --> 00:07:32,388
Go ahead.

135
00:07:32,388 --> 00:07:35,968
202-555-0163.

136
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:42,600
It's encrypted. I can't hack it.

137
00:07:43,168 --> 00:07:45,600
- So how do we get access? - We need a warrant.

138
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:49,253
- A warrant? What are you talking about, like going to a judge? - Who said anything about a judge?

139
00:07:49,253 --> 00:07:52,174
I said we need a warrant, I didn't say it needed to be real.

140
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,580
The President seems to be a reasonable man.

141
00:07:56,206 --> 00:07:58,172
Did you even try to approach him directly?

142
00:07:58,172 --> 00:08:01,742
- I told you, that's not an option. - But how could you be so sure?

143
00:08:01,742 --> 00:08:04,726
So, he had an illegitimate child. That was over 30 years ago.

144
00:08:04,726 --> 00:08:07,629
- Kincaid raped Nina's mother. - What?

145
00:08:10,585 --> 00:08:13,076
Kincaid was a young congressman at the time.

146
00:08:14,123 --> 00:08:16,639
Nina's mother was a young journalist.

147
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,431
She went to his hotel room. For an interview.

148
00:08:22,505 --> 00:08:23,697
And he raped her.

149
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,997
A few weeks later, she threatened to go public with her story.

150
00:08:30,298 --> 00:08:32,346
Kincaid tried to buy her silence.

151
00:08:33,205 --> 00:08:34,914
How could you possibly know all this?

152
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:38,334
Burton Delaney was one of Kincaid's closest advisors.

153
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:40,357
He told me what happened next.

154
00:08:40,357 --> 00:08:44,049
I didn't force myself on her, Burton. Now, you believe me, right?

155
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:45,916
It's not about what I believe.

156
00:08:46,553 --> 00:08:50,244
It's about your reputation. Your political future.

157
00:08:50,244 --> 00:08:52,287
You're on the cusp right now, Paul.

158
00:08:52,287 --> 00:08:54,894
This accusation could derail your entire career.

159
00:08:54,894 --> 00:08:58,401
- I gave you the money to pay her off. - She wouldn't take it.

160
00:08:58,401 --> 00:09:01,344
Double the offer. Everyone has a price.

161
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,526
Not this one.

162
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:08,787
- We need to take a different approach. - Well, what exactly are you saying?

163
00:09:08,787 --> 00:09:11,700
I'm saying this is a problem that won't go away on its own.

164
00:09:12,787 --> 00:09:17,764
If you can't buy silence, you have to eliminate the source of the noise.

165
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:25,217
The woman's name was Kate Renner.

166
00:09:26,174 --> 00:09:27,338
Burton knew her.

167
00:09:29,239 --> 00:09:31,138
He couldn't go through with it, so...

168
00:09:31,824 --> 00:09:33,912
he helped her get out of the country.

169
00:09:33,912 --> 00:09:37,165
A few months later, he found out she was pregnant with Kincaid's child.

170
00:09:37,165 --> 00:09:39,369
- Where is she now? - She died in childbirth.

171
00:09:39,369 --> 00:09:42,187
- Oh... - Burton adopted the girl.

172
00:09:42,187 --> 00:09:43,921
Nina. Raised her.

173
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:47,161
He never told her or anybody else the truth.

174
00:09:47,815 --> 00:09:50,319
The only reason he told me is because...

175
00:09:55,552 --> 00:09:56,990
because Nina got sick.

176
00:09:59,793 --> 00:10:01,371
So, now do you understand?

177
00:10:02,366 --> 00:10:05,722
Kincaid is not a reasonable man.

178
00:10:23,747 --> 00:10:24,959
DAD

179
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:37,686
<i>Hey, Boyd. It's Dad.</i>

180
00:10:37,686 --> 00:10:39,458
<i>Did you get my last message?</i>

181
00:10:40,236 --> 00:10:42,102
<i>I haven't heard from you in a couple of days.</i>

182
00:10:42,102 --> 00:10:43,653
<i>Hey, call me back, buddy.</i>

183
00:10:48,093 --> 00:10:50,666
<i>Trying you again. Hey, call me back.</i>

184
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:55,499
<i>Uh, I'm sure you're fine, but, uh, I'm getting worried.</i>

185
00:10:55,499 --> 00:10:59,323
<i>Okay? Talk soon. I love you.</i>

186
00:11:01,724 --> 00:11:02,888
You just found this phone?

187
00:11:03,983 --> 00:11:07,124
Yeah, it must have fallen out of his pocket when he climbed in the window.

188
00:11:09,453 --> 00:11:12,445
But this is the first time I heard it ring, I swear.

189
00:11:12,445 --> 00:11:13,865
Relax, I believe you.

190
00:11:15,794 --> 00:11:19,809
What if Boyd's dad goes to the police? What are we gonna do?

191
00:11:22,361 --> 00:11:23,866
Maybe there's a medical solution.

192
00:11:23,866 --> 00:11:27,616
If there were a medical solution, do you really think I'd be going through all this?

193
00:11:27,616 --> 00:11:30,794
Let me review Nina's files, maybe I'll come up with something that...

194
00:11:30,794 --> 00:11:33,506
I've talked to the best oncologists in the world, Ellen.

195
00:11:34,056 --> 00:11:36,544
There are no other solutions.

196
00:11:36,544 --> 00:11:38,470
Look, I'm sure you're right.

197
00:11:39,453 --> 00:11:41,216
But if I'm going to be standing over that man,

198
00:11:41,216 --> 00:11:43,880
watching him die on the operating table,

199
00:11:44,592 --> 00:11:47,913
I can't be wondering if Nina could have been saved some other way.

200
00:11:48,471 --> 00:11:49,480
You're right.

201
00:11:50,215 --> 00:11:52,981
Read the files. Examine everything.

202
00:11:52,981 --> 00:11:55,318
You'll come to the same conclusion I did.

203
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:03,561
I'll send over Nina's medical records to your office today.

204
00:12:14,647 --> 00:12:18,097
Mr. President. I'm afraid he was needed in another meeting.

205
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,444
Ted Jankowski. Acting Chief of Staff.

206
00:12:21,444 --> 00:12:23,228
It's nice to finally meet you.

207
00:12:23,885 --> 00:12:26,630
- Something I can help you with? - Uh, yes, there might be.

208
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:29,217
First of all, my condolences on Quentin.

209
00:12:29,217 --> 00:12:31,540
I met him a few times. Great loss.

210
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,927
I need to speak with the President.

211
00:12:32,927 --> 00:12:35,390
He and I were supposed to discuss a major policy initiative.

212
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,872
- What initiative? - I'm afraid it's classified.

213
00:12:37,872 --> 00:12:40,525
I'm sorry, but the President's schedule is fully booked.

214
00:12:40,525 --> 00:12:43,860
- We can set something up for next week. - Uh, this matter is time sensitive.

215
00:12:44,526 --> 00:12:47,135
Any chance I can get even a brief meeting on schedule sooner than that?

216
00:12:47,135 --> 00:12:49,160
Sorry, it's a busy week.

217
00:13:34,846 --> 00:13:36,910
- Ellen? - I found something in your wife's files.

218
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:40,008
1,249 people were tested, not one of them was a match.

219
00:13:40,008 --> 00:13:43,087
But there was one anonymous donor who came close.

220
00:13:43,087 --> 00:13:44,024
How close?

221
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:45,492
28%.

222
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:47,504
So? That's not enough for a viable transplant.

223
00:13:47,504 --> 00:13:50,467
I know, but this person could be a relative, maybe even a sibling.

224
00:13:50,467 --> 00:13:52,836
What I'm saying is, this person could lead us to a better match.

225
00:13:52,836 --> 00:13:54,951
If there were a better match, we'd already know.

226
00:13:55,748 --> 00:13:57,691
I'm trying to save your wife.

227
00:14:00,425 --> 00:14:01,330
What do you need?

228
00:14:02,005 --> 00:14:05,549
- Uh, name and address. - Give me the donor number.

229
00:14:06,073 --> 00:14:09,025
With Creasy gone, I've got no damn access.

230
00:14:09,025 --> 00:14:12,193
You still think Kincaid will go public with OTI before the surgery?

231
00:14:12,193 --> 00:14:13,085
Possibly.

232
00:14:13,768 --> 00:14:16,283
- I don't know. - Why roll the dice?

233
00:14:16,283 --> 00:14:19,045
- What are you saying? - OTI is important.

234
00:14:19,911 --> 00:14:22,896
Don't give this bastard a chance to take that away from you.

235
00:14:23,971 --> 00:14:28,584
Do we really want to bet the future of this country on Dr. Sanders?

236
00:14:29,971 --> 00:14:31,936
Or Duncan Carlisle?

237
00:14:31,936 --> 00:14:33,898
They tried and failed.

238
00:14:35,384 --> 00:14:38,870
Why should we believe they'll pull it off this time, hmm?

239
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:41,518
Fair enough, but what other options do we have?

240
00:14:41,518 --> 00:14:44,130
It's not that easy to kill the President.

241
00:14:53,841 --> 00:14:55,484
Maryland College Hospital
SCHOOL OF MEDICINE

242
00:15:00,353 --> 00:15:01,251
What did you find?

243
00:15:01,251 --> 00:15:05,246
The name of your mystery donor is Sally Whitaker. I'm texting you her address now.

244
00:15:05,246 --> 00:15:07,535
Okay, perfect. I'll let you know what I come up with.

245
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,130
Can I help you? I'm looking for Sally Whitaker. Is she in?

246
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:52,225
I'm afraid she's not.

247
00:15:53,047 --> 00:15:55,652
Do you know when she'll be back? I really need to speak with her.

248
00:15:56,214 --> 00:15:57,030
What for?

249
00:15:57,549 --> 00:15:59,824
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm with the Reston Blood Bank.

250
00:15:59,824 --> 00:16:02,678
I tried calling a few times, but I couldn't get through.

251
00:16:02,678 --> 00:16:05,157
Um, it's about a recent donation Sally made.

252
00:16:05,157 --> 00:16:07,315
I have the paperwork here somewhere.

253
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:10,340
Do you mind if I come in for a moment?

254
00:16:11,578 --> 00:16:12,400
Okay.

255
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:17,108
But, uh, you must have some kind of a mix-up.

256
00:16:17,108 --> 00:16:20,594
Sally never mentioned anything about giving blood.

257
00:16:20,594 --> 00:16:23,954
Are you sure? Our records indicate she did make a donation.

258
00:16:23,954 --> 00:16:27,851
It was earmarked for a very sick patient, Nina Carlisle?

259
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:29,686
Never heard of her.

260
00:16:38,219 --> 00:16:39,100
Miss?

261
00:16:40,398 --> 00:16:45,389
- Are you all right? - Sorry, I just, uh, that photo there...

262
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,775
It just looks like someone I know.

263
00:16:52,656 --> 00:16:55,018
Oh, yeah. Them. Um...

264
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,323
Yeah, they're, uh, friends of my wife.

265
00:17:01,203 --> 00:17:03,173
Okay, well, I'm sorry to have bothered you.

266
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:06,678
Uh, can I just trouble you for a glass of water?

267
00:17:06,678 --> 00:17:09,423
I've been driving in the car all day, I just...

268
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,803
Sure.

269
00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:26,771
Thank you.

270
00:17:28,913 --> 00:17:30,977
I understand the President's going to New York tomorrow.

271
00:17:30,977 --> 00:17:33,703
- Do you have his full itinerary? - They just issued it to us.

272
00:17:33,703 --> 00:17:35,367
I'm talking about his unofficial itinerary.

273
00:17:35,367 --> 00:17:37,447
The one that includes his off-the-record meetings.

274
00:17:37,447 --> 00:17:38,497
I will.

275
00:17:38,497 --> 00:17:40,316
I'm on his detail tomorrow.

276
00:17:40,316 --> 00:17:42,996
He'll have at least one off-the-record meeting tomorrow.

277
00:17:43,499 --> 00:17:47,049
I want exact details. Time and place. Operational security.

278
00:17:47,049 --> 00:17:49,108
- Everything. - Copy that.

279
00:17:49,108 --> 00:17:51,351
Logan, one more thing.

280
00:17:51,926 --> 00:17:54,060
I'm gonna need you to get in touch with somebody.

281
00:18:07,162 --> 00:18:08,117
All
Sally

282
00:18:08,117 --> 00:18:09,000
Calling...
Sally

283
00:18:10,887 --> 00:18:14,160
Hey, sweetie. I'm with customers, can I call you right back?

284
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,363
Sorry, my name's Ellen.

285
00:18:15,363 --> 00:18:18,493
I found this phone in the street and just called the last number dialed.

286
00:18:18,493 --> 00:18:21,792
Oh, thanks so much, it belongs to my husband.

287
00:18:21,792 --> 00:18:23,649
Well, I just want to return it to the owner.

288
00:18:23,649 --> 00:18:27,383
That's so nice of you. I can come get it wherever is convenient.

289
00:18:27,383 --> 00:18:30,710
Uh, well, I'm driving right now, where are you?

290
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:34,735
Uh, North Arlington. Near Wilson Boulevard and 20th.

291
00:18:34,735 --> 00:18:38,252
Well, I can drop it over to you if you like.

292
00:18:38,252 --> 00:18:40,392
I have to head over there in about a half hour, anyway.

293
00:18:40,392 --> 00:18:45,392
Really? You're an angel. I'm in the antique store on the corner.

294
00:18:45,392 --> 00:18:46,624
See you soon.

295
00:18:50,528 --> 00:18:51,639
Yeah?

296
00:18:51,639 --> 00:18:54,485
- Raven gave me your number. - Okay, I'm listening.

297
00:18:54,985 --> 00:18:56,659
I'd like to meet in person.

298
00:18:56,659 --> 00:18:59,961
- It's about a job opportunity. - Where's the party?

299
00:18:59,961 --> 00:19:01,835
I can tell you everything in person.

300
00:19:01,835 --> 00:19:06,482
But Raven said to let you know that it'd be a platinum level gig, platinum level pay.

301
00:19:06,482 --> 00:19:07,686
Sounds good.

302
00:19:07,686 --> 00:19:10,147
Meet me in 30 minutes at Mitchell Park.

303
00:19:10,147 --> 00:19:13,225
- Southwest corner, I'll find you. - See you there.

304
00:19:15,017 --> 00:19:16,670
What, did you use a fake warrant?

305
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:20,275
Warrant was real. Signature was fake. Nobody ever looks.

306
00:19:20,275 --> 00:19:23,120
- So, what's this phone call about? - I don't know.

307
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,931
You think it's anything to do with us?

308
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:29,230
In the past 24 hours, a Secret Service agent and the Chief of Staff were killed.

309
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:32,087
The fact that Logan's reaching out to some sort of operative?

310
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:33,563
It's not good.

311
00:19:51,297 --> 00:19:54,197
Hi. I called you about your husband's phone.

312
00:19:54,197 --> 00:19:58,949
Oh, hello. I'm just finishing up some paperwork, why don't you come on back?

313
00:20:06,392 --> 00:20:08,326
You have some beautiful pieces here.

314
00:20:12,481 --> 00:20:13,849
Who the hell are you?

315
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:18,831
Start talking.

316
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,051
Put the gun down. Please.

317
00:20:22,051 --> 00:20:23,729
Who are you?

318
00:20:24,822 --> 00:20:27,361
- I'm a doctor. - My husband called me.

319
00:20:27,361 --> 00:20:32,202
I know you came to the house. You stole his phone. What do you want?

320
00:20:33,368 --> 00:20:35,934
I know you're related to Nina Carlisle.

321
00:20:36,674 --> 00:20:39,734
You two are a 28% match for bone marrow type.

322
00:20:39,734 --> 00:20:43,318
Trust me, you don't want to get involved in this.

323
00:20:43,318 --> 00:20:45,224
I saw the wedding photo in your hall.

324
00:20:45,224 --> 00:20:49,879
If you knew what was good for you, you'd leave and never come back.

325
00:20:49,879 --> 00:20:51,474
Well, I can't do that.

326
00:20:54,001 --> 00:20:55,475
I know who you are.

327
00:20:57,109 --> 00:20:58,306
You're Kate Renner.

328
00:20:59,088 --> 00:21:00,135
Nina's mother.

329
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,092
I haven't heard that name in many years.

330
00:21:15,531 --> 00:21:17,084
Why are you here?

331
00:21:19,122 --> 00:21:20,525
Burton Delaney.

332
00:21:21,372 --> 00:21:24,793
He told me your story, I'm sorry.

333
00:21:24,793 --> 00:21:28,482
It was a lifetime ago. I've moved on.

334
00:21:29,339 --> 00:21:32,932
- I thought you were dead. - That was the idea.

335
00:21:34,331 --> 00:21:38,015
Must have been hard. Giving up your child.

336
00:21:39,937 --> 00:21:41,393
What do you want?

337
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:44,162
Your daughter is sick.

338
00:21:46,274 --> 00:21:48,008
She has leukemia.

339
00:21:48,579 --> 00:21:50,236
She needs a donor.

340
00:21:50,941 --> 00:21:54,304
You're not a close enough match, but I was hoping you could lead me to one.

341
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:57,719
If Nina has one other blood relative, there's a chance.

342
00:21:59,178 --> 00:22:01,529
Did you ever have any other children?

343
00:22:02,102 --> 00:22:02,990
No.

344
00:22:09,946 --> 00:22:11,008
I see.

345
00:22:13,902 --> 00:22:17,604
Well, I'm sorry to have disturbed you.

346
00:22:22,868 --> 00:22:25,347
Why is Nina's life so important to you?

347
00:22:27,373 --> 00:22:28,606
Because...

348
00:22:31,126 --> 00:22:32,646
I have a family too.

349
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,726
Hi, can I help you?

350
00:22:44,726 --> 00:22:46,842
Yes, I'm John Norton.

351
00:22:47,454 --> 00:22:48,563
Boyd's father.

352
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:50,802
Oh, right.

353
00:22:51,353 --> 00:22:53,262
Boyd. Right okay.

354
00:22:53,262 --> 00:22:55,571
Um, I'm Brian Sanders. Come on in.

355
00:22:57,009 --> 00:22:58,387
Nice to meet you.

356
00:22:59,107 --> 00:23:01,350
Morgan's told me all about your son.

357
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:04,026
Oh, well...

358
00:23:04,026 --> 00:23:05,562
I'm sure you heard the news.

359
00:23:06,739 --> 00:23:09,845
No, I haven't. Everything okay?

360
00:23:09,845 --> 00:23:11,393
Not exactly.

361
00:23:12,369 --> 00:23:14,406
I'm afraid, Boyd, uh...

362
00:23:14,406 --> 00:23:18,182
Well, he broke up with your daughter in a rather cowardly manner.

363
00:23:19,286 --> 00:23:21,804
Oh. Um, okay.

364
00:23:22,513 --> 00:23:24,594
Well, listen, not to worry.

365
00:23:25,168 --> 00:23:29,748
Boys that age tend to not have the highest emotional IQs.

366
00:23:29,748 --> 00:23:31,467
Yeah, I agree.

367
00:23:31,467 --> 00:23:33,376
That's why I'm here.

368
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:35,293
I'd like to talk to Morgan, in person.

369
00:23:35,293 --> 00:23:36,938
I feel I owe it to her.

370
00:23:38,281 --> 00:23:40,192
Okay. Sure.

371
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:42,823
Morgan!

372
00:23:43,468 --> 00:23:44,566
Morgan?

373
00:23:49,848 --> 00:23:53,261
This is Mr. Norton. Boyd's dad.

374
00:23:54,248 --> 00:23:55,450
We've met.

375
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,385
- Hello, Mr. Norton. - Hi, Morgan.

376
00:23:58,385 --> 00:23:59,996
Nice to see you, I...

377
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,222
wish it were under different circumstances.

378
00:24:04,667 --> 00:24:08,242
I felt I needed to come over and apologize to you on my son's behalf.

379
00:24:08,242 --> 00:24:11,036
That's so sweet of you, but you didn't have to do that.

380
00:24:12,259 --> 00:24:13,251
I'm fine.

381
00:24:14,257 --> 00:24:17,072
Really, I'm okay.

382
00:24:17,674 --> 00:24:19,726
Um, I'm confused.

383
00:24:21,453 --> 00:24:23,825
I'm sorry, Mr. Sanders, I thought you knew.

384
00:24:25,942 --> 00:24:29,474
Look, I heard from Boyd about an hour ago. He told me everything.

385
00:24:33,651 --> 00:24:35,496
This is no ordinary target.

386
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:38,595
He's a man, like any other.

387
00:24:38,595 --> 00:24:40,613
You pull the trigger, you get paid.

388
00:24:41,464 --> 00:24:43,957
I want double what you're offering.

389
00:24:43,957 --> 00:24:47,510
I can go back with that. Anything else?

390
00:24:48,041 --> 00:24:50,824
Yeah, I pick my team.

391
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:53,600
Okay.

392
00:24:54,127 --> 00:24:56,866
I'll reach out to you later today with more details.

393
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:01,212
Come to think of it, I do have one question.

394
00:25:02,203 --> 00:25:03,159
Why?

395
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:11,601
It's okay, Mr. Norton. My parents know that I got pregnant.

396
00:25:11,601 --> 00:25:14,508
Boyd shouldn't have run out on his responsibilities.

397
00:25:14,508 --> 00:25:19,446
I mean, now is not the time to ship out on a fishing boat for three months.

398
00:25:23,248 --> 00:25:25,460
Well, he's been talking about that for a long time.

399
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:30,414
I know. He has no idea how hard the work's gonna be.

400
00:25:30,414 --> 00:25:31,950
Well, I don't blame him...

401
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:37,139
Mr. Norton, and I certainly don't blame you.

402
00:25:38,091 --> 00:25:40,392
I appreciate that, Morgan.

403
00:25:40,392 --> 00:25:42,474
Really, I do.

404
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:45,776
But you know, it's not really Boyd's fault.

405
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:47,946
The truth is,

406
00:25:49,404 --> 00:25:51,516
I should have set a better example.

407
00:25:52,862 --> 00:25:55,189
I wasn't around enough when he was growing up.

408
00:25:59,347 --> 00:26:01,338
It was nice to see you again, Morgan.

409
00:26:03,536 --> 00:26:05,846
Guess my son has a lot of growing up to do.

410
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:15,419
I need your help. Take a look at this photo.

411
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,187
Who are they?

412
00:26:18,187 --> 00:26:20,844
The guy on the right is our contact inside the Secret Service.

413
00:26:20,844 --> 00:26:22,163
His name's Logan.

414
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:24,592
He met up with that other guy about a half an hour ago.

415
00:26:24,592 --> 00:26:26,719
Duncan wants to know who he is.

416
00:26:26,719 --> 00:26:29,920
I'll run it through facial recognition. See if we get a hit.

417
00:26:37,905 --> 00:26:38,983
Are you okay?

418
00:26:40,148 --> 00:26:41,330
Yeah, I'm fine.

419
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:48,107
What happened with Sally Whitaker?

420
00:26:51,757 --> 00:26:54,411
- She's Nina's mother. - What?

421
00:26:55,272 --> 00:26:58,549
- Sally Whitaker's real name is Kate Renner. - Are you positive?

422
00:26:58,549 --> 00:27:00,123
Yes, I...

423
00:27:00,696 --> 00:27:02,769
I saw a picture of you and Nina.

424
00:27:02,769 --> 00:27:06,210
In her house. And I confronted her and...

425
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:09,208
she confirmed everything you said about Kincaid.

426
00:27:09,208 --> 00:27:11,892
She's been living under an assumed identity all these years.

427
00:27:15,208 --> 00:27:18,566
- Why didn't you tell me? - What good would it have done for me to tell you?

428
00:27:18,566 --> 00:27:21,348
You don't think Nina would have wanted to know her mother was alive?

429
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:25,671
Of course she would have. That's why I had to lie.

430
00:27:25,671 --> 00:27:28,618
You think I wanted to keep this secret? I did it to protect everybody.

431
00:27:28,618 --> 00:27:31,029
Nina, Kate, Sawyer.

432
00:27:32,184 --> 00:27:34,500
- You could have told me. - I could have.

433
00:27:35,019 --> 00:27:36,168
But then what?

434
00:27:36,168 --> 00:27:40,210
You'd be forced to lie to your wife every day for the rest of your life.

435
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:43,550
I carried that burden with me since she was born.

436
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:44,430
Trust me.

437
00:27:45,157 --> 00:27:47,165
I did you a favor, Duncan.

438
00:27:49,842 --> 00:27:52,257
You know I always thought of you like a son.

439
00:27:52,257 --> 00:27:53,380
I know you have.

440
00:27:54,876 --> 00:27:56,763
So I'm gonna ask you one time.

441
00:27:57,922 --> 00:28:00,195
Is there anything else you haven't told me?

442
00:28:01,044 --> 00:28:03,702
- Excuse me? - I don't want any more surprises.

443
00:28:03,702 --> 00:28:05,580
I've told you everything.

444
00:28:22,482 --> 00:28:23,445
Duncan, it's me.

445
00:28:24,127 --> 00:28:25,248
What is it?

446
00:28:25,248 --> 00:28:28,378
Kramer took a photo of a guy talking to the Secret Service agent.

447
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,206
You got a name?

448
00:28:30,206 --> 00:28:34,224
Robert Harper. Former Army Ranger and decorated sniper.

449
00:28:35,931 --> 00:28:39,537
- Sniper? - Four tours of duty in Iraq.
(United States Military)

450
00:28:39,537 --> 00:28:41,407
Over 100 confirmed kills.

451
00:28:48,374 --> 00:28:51,004
Duncan. What is it?

452
00:28:54,423 --> 00:28:56,795
The guy Logan was talking to in the park.

453
00:28:59,221 --> 00:29:00,401
He's a sniper.

454
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:04,311
They want to take me out.

455
00:29:14,762 --> 00:29:19,224
They did the math and decided that it was just too risky to continue the operation.

456
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:22,153
- Creasy, Hoffman. - Now me.

457
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:24,401
They're mopping up.

458
00:29:25,311 --> 00:29:27,318
- You should get out of the country. - No.

459
00:29:28,586 --> 00:29:31,590
- We've come too far. - So, what do you propose?

460
00:29:36,081 --> 00:29:38,269
Shoot the sniper before he shoots me.

461
00:29:45,114 --> 00:29:47,497
What the hell just happened back there with Boyd's father?

462
00:29:50,383 --> 00:29:52,300
I found Boyd's phone.

463
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,420
And his Dad kept calling,

464
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:56,269
so Sandrine and I texted him back.

465
00:29:56,894 --> 00:30:00,892
We made up a cover story, so that Mr. Norton wouldn't go to the cops.

466
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,730
What?

467
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:05,002
I can't believe you. When were you going to tell me this?

468
00:30:06,205 --> 00:30:07,739
We didn't know he was going to come over.

469
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:11,442
"We"? Hey. We're not on the same side, Morgan.

470
00:30:11,442 --> 00:30:13,743
We have to cooperate with them.

471
00:30:17,143 --> 00:30:19,361
- Besides... - Besides what?

472
00:30:22,107 --> 00:30:23,994
They didn't mean to kill Boyd.

473
00:30:25,542 --> 00:30:27,996
It just... happened.

474
00:30:27,996 --> 00:30:31,919
Oh, for God sakes. Morgan, listen.

475
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,495
These people are holding us hostage.

476
00:30:35,363 --> 00:30:37,715
They're evil. You see that, don't you?

477
00:30:49,294 --> 00:30:52,262
- How are you feeling? - Optimistic.

478
00:30:53,183 --> 00:30:55,496
Now, frankly, I never liked the idea of sitting back and

479
00:30:55,496 --> 00:30:57,908
relying on somebody else. I'm a Marine at heart.

480
00:30:58,732 --> 00:31:01,911
- Only happy in the mud. - But you clean up so well.

481
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:05,292
You can't have dirt on your shoes in the oval office?

482
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:08,850
That is why I have you to keep me civilized.

483
00:31:09,637 --> 00:31:11,319
Not too civilized.

484
00:31:19,152 --> 00:31:21,113
What about that FBI agent?

485
00:31:21,619 --> 00:31:23,236
Carlisle.

486
00:31:23,236 --> 00:31:25,767
- I'm handling it. - Good.

487
00:31:40,133 --> 00:31:44,521
I'm worried about Morgan. She's starting to believe these guys.

488
00:31:44,521 --> 00:31:45,605
What do you mean?

489
00:31:46,868 --> 00:31:49,428
She helped them cover up Boyd's death.

490
00:31:49,428 --> 00:31:52,594
It's like she's... part of their team.

491
00:31:52,594 --> 00:31:56,018
She told me what happened. I don't understand why you're so upset with her.

492
00:31:57,574 --> 00:31:59,250
What do you mean you don't know why?

493
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:03,079
I think she did the right thing, given the circumstances.

494
00:32:03,583 --> 00:32:07,337
We're in too deep. We no longer have the privilege of being...

495
00:32:08,328 --> 00:32:10,617
- moralistic. - What the hell does that mean?

496
00:32:11,595 --> 00:32:13,393
I think your initial instinct was right.

497
00:32:13,393 --> 00:32:16,255
- Initial instinct? - That I should do what they want.

498
00:32:19,432 --> 00:32:23,976
I know I told you to cooperate, but you were the one who had the strength to say no.

499
00:32:23,976 --> 00:32:25,637
You fought back.

500
00:32:25,637 --> 00:32:28,686
I admire that about you. You made the right choice.

501
00:32:29,425 --> 00:32:30,342
Did I?

502
00:32:30,955 --> 00:32:33,707
Too many people have died since then. You almost died.

503
00:32:34,446 --> 00:32:36,240
All to save one man?

504
00:32:37,442 --> 00:32:42,185
No, I'm not willing to sacrifice our family for the life of Paul Kincaid.

505
00:32:43,848 --> 00:32:45,296
Where is that coming from?

506
00:32:46,725 --> 00:32:48,075
Nowhere.

507
00:32:48,075 --> 00:32:50,921
It's just a decision that I have to make.

508
00:32:50,921 --> 00:32:52,751
That's Duncan talking.

509
00:32:55,055 --> 00:32:58,806
- What? - He's been manipulating us from the start.

510
00:32:59,448 --> 00:33:01,844
You gotta let me in. We gotta be together on this.

511
00:33:01,844 --> 00:33:04,519
If I do what he wants, then we're free.

512
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:09,141
We cannot trust him.

513
00:33:10,889 --> 00:33:11,950
I disagree.

514
00:33:17,009 --> 00:33:19,650
The guy was hard to track down but I got an address for you.

515
00:33:20,414 --> 00:33:21,336
Thanks.

516
00:33:21,336 --> 00:33:23,230
- Do you need any help? - No, I got it.

517
00:33:24,784 --> 00:33:28,962
And thanks for sticking around. Archer was right about you.

518
00:33:29,611 --> 00:33:30,578
You're good.

519
00:33:32,045 --> 00:33:34,084
I'll take care of the sniper tonight.

520
00:33:40,855 --> 00:33:43,454
TEXT MASSAGE
Meet me at Gaskin&Smith St in 1Hour

521
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:49,114
Your son's future could depend on it.

522
00:33:58,565 --> 00:34:00,592
- What's wrong? - Nothing.

523
00:34:01,784 --> 00:34:02,910
I, um...

524
00:34:04,114 --> 00:34:05,315
It's about my kid.

525
00:34:08,065 --> 00:34:10,219
Well, go. I'll cover for you.

526
00:34:11,968 --> 00:34:12,924
Thanks.

527
00:37:41,424 --> 00:37:44,079
BOARDING PASS

528
00:37:51,971 --> 00:37:54,530
BOARDING PASS 
Name ROBERT HARPER
Flight: 1707
Depart: Washington D.C(DCA) 9:05 PM
Arrive: New York, NY(LGA)    10:17 PM

529
00:38:03,089 --> 00:38:04,069
What do you want?

530
00:38:07,308 --> 00:38:08,911
This was in Boyd's pocket.

531
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:11,984
Guess he meant it for you.

532
00:38:32,056 --> 00:38:33,434
Where did you bury him?

533
00:38:34,241 --> 00:38:36,846
Don't think about that. Just keep the ring.

534
00:38:43,164 --> 00:38:45,238
U.S. NEWS
President....??????

535
00:38:53,126 --> 00:38:56,309
- Did you kill him? - I went to his apartment, but he wasn't there.

536
00:38:56,309 --> 00:38:58,404
He's on a plane to New York City right now.

537
00:38:59,095 --> 00:39:02,507
If he's trying to kill you, why is he on his way to New York?

538
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:04,242
Because I'm not the target.

539
00:39:05,416 --> 00:39:07,000
The President is.

540
00:39:07,601 --> 00:39:10,571
He's scheduled to be in New York all day tomorrow.

541
00:39:10,571 --> 00:39:12,639
The question is, where and when?

542
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:14,184
How are they planning to take him out?

543
00:39:24,575 --> 00:39:25,840
Glad you could make it.

544
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:29,409
- Where's my son? - Safe and sound. With his father.

545
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:31,213
Call him if you don't believe me.

546
00:39:31,213 --> 00:39:34,950
- I just needed to make sure you'd show. - What do you want?

547
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:39,880
I have a business proposition for you. Low risk. High reward.

548
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,358
My kid is the one who believes in fairy tales.

549
00:39:42,358 --> 00:39:45,961
Not me. I need a friend inside Duncan's operation.

550
00:39:45,961 --> 00:39:47,066
A friend?

551
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:50,395
You're talking to the wrong girl.

552
00:39:50,956 --> 00:39:52,560
Okay, a spy.

553
00:39:53,551 --> 00:39:54,416
Better?

554
00:40:00,401 --> 00:40:01,618
What are you offering?

555
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:11,425
He spends the morning at the UN, but security there is far too tight.

556
00:40:11,425 --> 00:40:15,671
Lunch and photos at the New York Stock Exchange and then a meeting at the Federal Reserve.

557
00:40:15,671 --> 00:40:18,740
Both hard targets. Doesn't seem viable.

558
00:40:20,896 --> 00:40:21,718
Here.

559
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:27,488
At 5:30, the President has scheduled a meeting
with Mike Petrocelli, head of the Teamsters.

560
00:40:27,488 --> 00:40:30,066
- That meeting is a fiction. - How do you know?

561
00:40:30,066 --> 00:40:33,302
Kincaid's got the unions in his pocket for years,

562
00:40:33,302 --> 00:40:36,849
and he hates Petrocelli, he's not wasting an hour with him.

563
00:40:36,849 --> 00:40:38,255
Unless it's an election year.

564
00:40:38,255 --> 00:40:39,703
So where do you think he's going?

565
00:40:45,632 --> 00:40:46,950
To church.

566
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:47,755
What?

567
00:40:47,755 --> 00:40:49,351
When I was in his camp,

568
00:40:50,195 --> 00:40:53,593
he always stopped by St. Theodore's when he was in New York.

569
00:40:53,593 --> 00:40:56,066
The church is on Broadway and 24th,

570
00:40:56,066 --> 00:40:58,968
which is five minutes away from his 4:30 meeting.

571
00:40:58,968 --> 00:41:01,348
- You think that's where he's going to be? - I do.

572
00:41:02,772 --> 00:41:05,325
And it's the perfect place to take him out.

573
00:41:05,325 --> 00:41:07,721
If they succeed, Nina dies.

574
00:41:07,721 --> 00:41:09,510
Then we need to get there first.

575
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:11,500
