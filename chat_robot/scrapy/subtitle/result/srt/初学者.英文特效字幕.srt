00:41:11,222 --> 00:41:15,682
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}- Oh, God, what have you got this time?
- It's a green caterpillar.

474
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,489
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}No, no, no, you don't have a green caterpillar.

475
00:41:17,562 --> 00:41:18,941
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Yeah, I do.

476
00:41:18,963 --> 00:41:21,796
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Oh, my God. Gross! Oh, Jesus.

477
00:41:26,404 --> 00:41:29,532
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}- Hey, you going?
- Yeah. Michael's in town.

478
00:41:32,143 --> 00:41:33,167
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Right.

479
00:41:39,984 --> 00:41:42,111
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I thought he was your boyfriend.

480
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:45,050
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}At least I'm the number one boyfriend.

481
00:41:45,623 --> 00:41:46,681
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}- (GROANS)
- Pop.

482
00:41:48,192 --> 00:41:50,660
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}- My stomach.
- All right, come on.

483
00:41:52,463 --> 00:41:53,452
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Come on.

484
00:41:53,564 --> 00:41:56,192
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}- Well, let's say...
- Arthur, down.

485
00:41:56,267 --> 00:41:59,236
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Let's say, since you were little,

486
00:41:59,804 --> 00:42:05,208
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}and you always dreamed
of some day getting a lion?

487
00:42:06,544 --> 00:42:08,205
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}And you wait and you wait
and you wait and you wait,

488
00:42:08,279 --> 00:42:10,747
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}and the lion doesn't come.

489
00:42:12,984 --> 00:42:15,077
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Then along comes a giraffe.

490
00:42:16,954 --> 00:42:21,857
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}You can be alone
or you can be with the giraffe.

491
00:42:26,197 --> 00:42:27,528
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I'd wait for the lion.

492
00:42:28,432 --> 00:42:30,093
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}That's why I worry about you.

493
00:42:35,439 --> 00:42:36,463
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Here.

494
00:42:40,811 --> 00:42:45,680


495
00:42:46,317 --> 00:42:49,480


496
00:42:52,556 --> 00:42:56,014


497
00:42:56,093 --> 00:43:00,189


498
00:43:01,932 --> 00:43:04,628


499
00:43:04,702 --> 00:43:07,933


500
00:43:08,072 --> 00:43:11,803


501
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,979
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}You see,
you'd like me to be with someone like me.

502
00:43:19,083 --> 00:43:21,779
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I like Andy because he isn't like me.

503
00:43:23,587 --> 00:43:24,576
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}He's fun.

504

{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}(ANNA SHOUTS)

506
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:40,833
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Hey, what'd you get?

507
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:46,405
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Liv Ullmann. (LAUGHS) Very serious.

508
00:43:47,778 --> 00:43:51,509
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}And I found this crazy book.

509
00:43:51,582 --> 00:43:52,571


510
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:55,141
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}That's kind of a classic American thing.

511
00:43:55,219 --> 00:43:57,016
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}(BOTH LAUGHING)

512
00:43:58,689 --> 00:44:02,523
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Maybe we can figure out
some classic American things to do.

513
00:44:02,593 --> 00:44:03,582
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Yeah.

514
00:44:05,296 --> 00:44:06,820
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}- Like 75.
- Mmm-hmm.

515
00:44:10,768 --> 00:44:12,736
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Or 75 all the way through...

516
00:44:13,204 --> 00:44:14,364
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Through 80.

517
00:44:15,639 --> 00:44:18,437
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Louise Brooks, star of silent screen,

{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}effectively banned from Hollywood

{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}ended up
working as a salesgirl at Saks Fifth Avenue.

520
00:44:24,315 --> 00:44:26,943
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}- ANNA: I love her.
- And Veronica Lake.

521
00:44:28,052 --> 00:44:30,077
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Was a pin-up model and a film star.

522
00:44:30,621 --> 00:44:33,488
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Success was short-lived,
a series of broken marriages.

523
00:44:33,557 --> 00:44:36,219
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}She struggled with mental illness
and alcoholism.

524
00:44:37,962 --> 00:44:40,954
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}She died of hepatitis at the age of fifty-three.

525
00:44:42,633 --> 00:44:44,931
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}All these actor stories end sad.

00:44:45,469 --> 00:44:47,198
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I can tell you that already.

527
00:44:47,705 --> 00:44:49,138
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}That's not a good thing.

528
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:59,647
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}So. Now I want real Mexican food.

529
00:45:00,484 --> 00:45:04,420
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}And I want to try page

530
00:45:05,556 --> 00:45:06,545
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}forty-six.

531
00:45:08,959 --> 00:45:12,019

{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}ANNA: No.

533
00:45:14,064 --> 00:45:16,760
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}- Really?
- It's really good.

534
00:45:24,141 --> 00:45:25,802
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}What do you think?

535
00:45:29,346 --> 00:45:31,576
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-It's so good.It's good.
- Mmm.

536
00:45:31,682 --> 00:45:33,274
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}- I wasn't sure you'd like it.
- Why?

537
00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:36,751
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}You're an actress
and staying in that fancy hotel.

538
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:41,219
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I like this place.

539
00:45:44,128 --> 00:45:46,153
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I used to love hotels.

540
00:45:47,531 --> 00:45:52,434
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}But now I'm always in a new apartment
or in another hotel somewhere.

541
00:45:53,103 --> 00:45:57,267
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}How do you keep hold of friends?
Or boyfriends?

542
00:46:01,278 --> 00:46:04,907
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Makes it very easy to end up alone.

543
00:46:07,685 --> 00:46:09,277
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}To leave people.

544
00:46:14,692 --> 00:46:17,923
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}You can stay in the same place
and still find ways to leave people.

545
00:46:27,872 --> 00:46:29,237
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}ANNA: You are like that?

546
00:46:30,908 --> 00:46:31,966
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}It's what you do?

547
00:46:42,119 --> 00:46:44,644
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}So, we are the same?

548
00:46:46,523 --> 00:46:47,649
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Yeah, I guess so.

549
00:47:12,182 --> 00:47:13,672
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Oh, did I wake you?

550
00:47:14,184 --> 00:47:15,811
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Yeah. Thank you, Maria.

551
00:47:15,886 --> 00:47:17,183
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}And now that you're here,

552
00:47:17,721 --> 00:47:20,815
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-would you please put those up there? -What are you... Pop.

553
00:47:21,292 --> 00:47:23,487
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}- What...
- HAL: I'm reorganising.

554
00:47:24,028 --> 00:47:25,757
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Prednisone makes you crazy.

555
00:47:26,297 --> 00:47:28,857
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I'm just not sleepy. I feel great.

556
00:47:33,604 --> 00:47:34,935
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Pop, you should rest.

557
00:47:35,372 --> 00:47:39,172
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Soon as I finish these papers. Right, papers?

558
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:43,571
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}(IN DEEP VOICE) Right, Hal.
As soon as you're done, you can rest.

559
00:47:55,726 --> 00:47:56,920
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}ANNA: (CHUCKLES) What?

560
00:47:57,895 --> 00:47:59,294
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}OLIVER: Nothing. You're pretty.

561
00:48:00,564 --> 00:48:01,588
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}ANNA: No.

562
00:48:02,199 --> 00:48:03,188
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Yeah.

563
00:48:04,535 --> 00:48:06,264
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Jewish girls are not pretty.

564
00:48:06,337 --> 00:48:09,568
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}They can be interesting or cute,
but not pretty.

565
00:48:10,507 --> 00:48:11,872
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}You're kidding, right?

566
00:48:12,209 --> 00:48:13,972
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}That's what my mom told me.

567
00:48:16,747 --> 00:48:17,736
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}She did not.

568
00:48:18,849 --> 00:48:19,975
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}No, you're right.

569
00:48:20,284 --> 00:48:22,582
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}This girl at school told me that,

570
00:48:22,653 --> 00:48:27,215
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}and I went home
and my mom said, "Anna, who told you that?"

571
00:48:27,291 --> 00:48:31,421
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}OLIVER: This is what it looks like when
Anna tells me about being Jewish in 2003.

572
00:48:31,929 --> 00:48:34,159
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}And when I tell her my mother was Jewish.

573
00:48:34,331 --> 00:48:38,199
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}And that my father turned in his gay badge
when my mother turned in her Jewish badge.

574
00:48:38,268 --> 00:48:40,566
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}And they got married in 1955.

575
00:48:41,872 --> 00:48:44,568
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}My mother didn't know she was Jewish
until she was thirteen.

576
00:48:44,641 --> 00:48:45,835
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}It was 1938.

577
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:48,205
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}This is what people looked like.

578
00:48:49,179 --> 00:48:51,306
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}And lions and giraffes.

579
00:48:51,615 --> 00:48:53,082
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}This man was the Man of the Year.

580
00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:54,139


581
00:48:54,351 --> 00:48:57,081
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Her father tried to hide that they were Jewish.

582
00:48:57,154 --> 00:49:01,284
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}This is the swim team that asked her to leave
once they discovered that she was Jewish.

583
00:49:01,725 --> 00:49:04,216
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}This is what pretty looked like in 1938.

584
00:49:05,562 --> 00:49:07,962
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}My father realised he was gay
when he was thirteen.

585
00:49:08,032 --> 00:49:09,465
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}It was 1938.

586
00:49:10,067 --> 00:49:11,659
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}This is what pretty looked like.

587
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:15,668
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}This is the high school where they first met.

588
00:49:15,939 --> 00:49:17,839
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}This is the war they both went to.

589
00:49:18,175 --> 00:49:20,575
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}And this man was popular
when they met again.

{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Our good fortune allowed us to feel a sadness

864

{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}and a happiness that I never saw with them.

{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}and I can really see Anna's eyes in 2003.

{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Her feet.

870
01:10:14,263 --> 01:10:18,597
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}This is what it looks like
when she says, "I love you," in 2003.

871
01:10:19,402 --> 01:10:21,632
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}This is what it looks like when she cries.

872
01:10:22,071 --> 01:10:25,268
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}When she tells me there's always
a new empty room waiting for her.

873

{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}They used to make her feel free.

874
01:10:29,345 --> 01:10:31,745
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Now they make her feel the opposite of free.

01:11:06,282 --> 01:11:07,715
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}- Last one.

{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}We loved each other.

890
01:11:57,466 --> 01:11:58,831
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}But you were gay the whole time.

{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Well, I worked hard not to be.

893
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:06,307
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I knew I was gay, though.

01:12:06,675 --> 01:12:09,701
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I mean, at parties I'd be staring

895
01:12:13,582 --> 01:12:15,106
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}What about sex?

01:12:15,818 --> 01:12:18,218
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Well, she didn't think I was the greatest lover.

897
01:12:20,489 --> 01:12:22,013
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}But we made do.

01:12:29,865 --> 01:12:32,356
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}- That's what I wanted.
- And Mom.

901
01:12:32,701 --> 01:12:34,828
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}- You wanted Mom, too, right?

902
01:12:34,937 --> 01:12:36,302
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Stop that.

903
01:12:42,945 --> 01:12:45,038

904
01:12:48,017 --> 01:12:49,541
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I said,

{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}The first Gay Pride flag was made by a man

921
01:13:40,503 --> 01:13:42,300
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}He gave a meaning to each colour.

{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}This was invented.

01:13:45,808 --> 01:13:47,139
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}This is what movies looked like.

926
01:13:49,545 --> 01:13:54,107
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}On November 27th, 1978,

927
01:13:54,783 --> 01:13:58,947
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}One week after, my father opened
his annual museum Christmas exhibit.

928
01:13:59,021 --> 01:14:01,489
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}He collected stuffed animals
from people in the community

929
01:14:01,557 --> 01:14:02,990
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}and he put them on display.

930
01:14:03,859 --> 01:14:06,054
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}My father printed a quote
from The Velveteen Rabbit

{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}in large type on the wall.

932
01:14:08,731 --> 01:14:11,632
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}The stuffed rabbit asked, "What is real?"

933
01:14:12,535 --> 01:14:15,402
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}And the rabbit asked, "Does it hurt?"

934
01:14:16,171 --> 01:14:18,469
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}And the horse said, "Sometimes."
