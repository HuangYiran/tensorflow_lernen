它怎么占了我的位

那个熊孩子出去买泡泡糖味的冰激凌
That dopey looking kid went out to get bubblegum ice cream.

或许一些特殊事件能触发她的记忆
Maybe some specifics would jog her memory.

25
00:01:01,388 --> 00:01:02,620

不  是"闪现男"
No. deja vu Man!

61
00:02:43,087 --> 00:02:44,318
该死  我老是遇不着他
Damn, I always miss him.

62
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,164
-他们在说谁呢  -闪现男
- What are they talking about? - deja vu Man.

63
00:02:46,351 --> 00:02:47,830
他是我老妈意淫出来的朋友
He's mom's imaginary friend.

64
00:02:47,831 --> 00:02:50,567
才不是  他是真实存在的
He's not imaginary. He's real.

65
00:02:50,855 --> 00:02:53,237
每隔几年就会闪现一次
He shows up every few years.

66
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:54,307
还记得第一次见面
The first time,

67
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:56,770
我正在等曾爷爷来接我放学
I was waiting for Paw Paw to pick me up from school.

68
00:02:56,895 --> 00:02:58,507
还当他是个变态呢
I just thought he was a pervert,

69
00:02:58,508 --> 00:03:00,703
但后来发现他胡子剃得超干净
but then when I saw he didn't have a mustache,

70
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:02,070
我琢磨着自己是不是
I assumed I was being discovered

71
00:03:02,071 --> 00:03:04,489
被便衣模特星探发现了
by an undercover modeling talent scout.

72
00:03:07,376 --> 00:03:09,957
门儿敲敲敲  清洁工来到

73
00:03:07,776 --> 00:03:11,788
他总是在我最不上照的时候出现
He always shows up when I'm at my least photogenic.

74
00:03:17,827 --> 00:03:20,627
最近一次是在大约一年前
The last time before today was about a year ago.

75
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:30,887
我们必须速度赶过去
We got to get there quick.

76
00:03:30,888 --> 00:03:32,097
我跟踪他到了理发店
I followed him to the barbershop

77
00:03:32,098 --> 00:03:33,431
他的头发可不多  分分钟就剪完了
and he doesn't have a lot of hair.

78
00:03:35,809 --> 00:03:38,143
轮到谁转了啊
Someone gonna spin, or what?

79
00:03:39,396 --> 00:03:40,450
他在那儿
There he is.

80
00:03:41,024 --> 00:03:42,109
让我看看
Let me see.

81
00:03:44,007 --> 00:03:44,884
看见了吗
You see him?

82
00:03:45,065 --> 00:03:47,566
没  被洗剪吹合唱团挡住了
No. The Hair-monizers are in the way.

83
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,321
他们看上去唱得很欢乐
They look like they sound great.

84
00:03:50,537 --> 00:03:52,395
快看  饼干男也在
Hey! Cookie Man is in there, too!

85
00:03:52,396 --> 00:03:53,432
哪个
Which one?

86
00:03:53,906 --> 00:03:55,489
窗户旁边正刮胡子的那个
The guy by the window getting a shave.

87
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:58,794
但那个就是闪现男啊
But... the guy by the window getting a shave, that's deja vu Man!

88
00:04:00,012 --> 00:04:02,688
所以说闪现男就是饼干男
Then deja vu Man is also Cookie Man!

89
00:04:04,062 --> 00:04:04,947
好吧  我忍不住了
Okay, fine, I'll bite--

90
00:04:04,948 --> 00:04:07,311
-谁是饼干男  -我爹意淫出来的朋友
- who's Cookie Man? - Dad's imaginary friend.

91
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:09,299
饼干男好多年前就出现了
Cookie Man started coming around years ago

92
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,468
当时吉米还是个小孩
when Jimmy was little.

93
00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:12,087
他总是出现在公园
He would show up at the park

94
00:04:12,087 --> 00:04:13,087
分饼干给我们吃
and share his cookies with us.

95
00:04:13,088 --> 00:04:14,733
还老打听吉米的事
He was always asking about Jimmy.

96
00:04:14,734 --> 00:04:16,328
这娃可聪明了
He's a very smart baby.

97
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,898
我觉得他是遗传到我的优良基因
I think he gets from me.

98
00:04:18,523 --> 00:04:21,779
-你是在喝母乳吗  -是啊  你想来点吗
- Are you drinking breast milk? - Yeah. You want some?

99
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,462
不  我就免了吧
Uh, no, I'm gonna pass.

100
00:04:25,994 --> 00:04:27,293
那个面具可真有意思
Well, that's an interesting mask.

101
00:04:27,294 --> 00:04:29,142
他扮的是谁啊
Uh, what's he supposed to be?

102
00:04:29,555 --> 00:04:32,369
我们问过他万圣节想装扮成谁
We asked him what he wanted to dress up as for Halloween--

103
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:33,702
他说  吉米
he said, "Jimmy."

104
00:04:34,152 --> 00:04:35,483
他只会说这个词
It's the only word he knows.

105
00:04:35,815 --> 00:04:37,596
-对吧  儿子  -吉米
- Isn't that right, boy? - Jimmy.

106
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:39,646
你想再来点饼干吗
Want some more cookies?

107
00:04:39,647 --> 00:04:40,509
吉米
Jimmy.

108
00:04:40,782 --> 00:04:41,676
你几岁了
How old are you?

109
00:04:41,677 --> 00:04:42,522
吉米
Jimmy.

110
00:04:42,825 --> 00:04:43,689
你叫什么名字
What's your name?

111
00:04:43,801 --> 00:04:44,596
饼干
Cookie!

112
00:04:45,017 --> 00:04:47,481
太好了  他学了个新词
Hey! He learned a new word!

113
00:04:47,961 --> 00:04:49,121
我就跟你说他很聪明吧
Told you he was smart.

114
00:04:53,815 --> 00:04:54,786
他上个月还刚出现过
He even showed up last month

115
00:04:54,787 --> 00:04:56,258
当时我正带喜旺在公园玩
when I was in the park with Hope.

116
00:04:56,259 --> 00:04:58,376
其实有很多陌生人
You know, there's a lot of strangers

117
00:04:58,377 --> 00:05:00,278
在镇上散发零食给孩子们吃
who hand treats to kids in this town,

118
00:05:00,895 --> 00:05:02,687
但目前为止  你的饼干是最美味的
but your cookies are by far the best.

119
00:05:02,688 --> 00:05:04,947
伯特  我可不是陌生人
Burt, please, I'm not a stranger.

120
00:05:05,062 --> 00:05:06,216
我是饼干男
I'm Cookie Man.

121
00:05:07,782 --> 00:05:09,156
我真的很抱歉  伯特
I'm really sorry, Burt.

122
00:05:09,157 --> 00:05:10,907
我还以为饼干男是你瞎编出来的呢
I always thought you made up Cookie Man

123
00:05:10,908 --> 00:05:12,916
帮着吉米不好好吃晚饭找借口
just to cover for spoiling Jimmy's dinner.

124
00:05:12,917 --> 00:05:16,109
我也很抱歉  我也常怀疑闪现男
I'm sorry, too. I sometimes wondered if deja vu Man

125
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,607
是你那疯狂阴谋论的又一产物
was just another one of your crazy conspiracy theories,

126
00:05:18,608 --> 00:05:20,295
就像飞碟啦  大脚怪啦
like UFOs or Bigfoot

127
00:05:20,296 --> 00:05:21,901
或什么特拉华州根本不存在
or that Delaware doesn't actually exist.

128
00:05:21,902 --> 00:05:24,214
有本事说出一个去过特拉华州的人试试看
Name one person that's ever been to Delaware.

129
00:05:24,215 --> 00:05:26,624
那个在刮胡子的男人
Did you say that deja vu-slash-Cookie Man

130
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,431
就是你们说的闪现饼干男
was the one in front getting a shave?

131
00:05:28,432 --> 00:05:31,427
-是啊  怎么了  -好奇先生也是他
- Yeah. Why? - 'Cause that's also Super Curious Guy!

132
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:32,824
好奇先生是谁啊
Who's Super Curious Guy?

133
00:05:32,825 --> 00:05:35,809
那是吉米意淫出来的朋友
That would be Jimmy's imaginary friend.

134
00:05:36,018 --> 00:05:37,472
他是真实存在的
He is not imaginary.

135
00:05:37,473 --> 00:05:40,460
这人总是时不时会在码头出现
He's this guy who shows up every now and then on the loading dock

136
00:05:40,461 --> 00:05:42,612
跟我问七问八
and asks me tons of questions.

137
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,893
我记得有一次他说
I remember once that he said...

138
00:05:44,894 --> 00:05:45,809
吉米  没空听你扯
Jimmy! There's no time!

139
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,709
知道你有好些趣事可以说
I'm sure you got two or three funny memories you could describe,

140
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:50,313
但我们现在得先想出下一步对策
but we need to figure out what to do next.

141
00:05:50,314 --> 00:05:52,079
是白人版摩根・弗里曼
Ooh! White Morgan Freeman!

142
00:05:59,803 --> 00:06:00,916
哦天哪
Oh, my God.

143
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:05,099
闪现男  饼干男  好奇先生居然
Deja Vu Man, Cookie Man, and Super Curious Guy is also

144
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,248
还是个外科医生  96年我见他偷了我妈的肾
Roofie Surgeon, who I saw steal my mother's kidney in 1996.

145
00:06:08,249 --> 00:06:09,271
此话当真
Really?

146
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,923
姐扯的  姐那时太寂寞  
No, I just felt left out.

147
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:12,073
伯特  我们怎么打算
Okay, Burt, how should we play this?

148
00:06:12,074 --> 00:06:13,900
你们干啥不直接过去
You guys, why don't you just go over there

149
00:06:13,901 --> 00:06:15,302
问他到底打的什么主意
and ask him what's going on?

150
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:18,243
你提得出这种建议
You make suggestions like that,

151
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:19,449
还不知道自己当年为啥寂寞
you wonder why you get left out?

152
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:20,551
多谢提议  塞布丽娜
Thanks, Sabrina.

153
00:06:20,552 --> 00:06:22,662
我们都知道  他是公务员
For all we know, he works for the government

154
00:06:22,663 --> 00:06:26,129
人一个不高兴就能把咱扔杰罗尼莫湾关上一辈子
and can lock us all up in Geronimo Bay for the rest of our lives.

155
00:06:22,663 --> 00:06:26,129
罗杰尼莫湾  二次元高级军事基地

156
00:06:26,508 --> 00:06:28,521
他要走了  咱得跟上
Oh, he's leaving, we've got to follow him,

157
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:29,579
看看他背后的主子到底是谁
find out who he works for.

158
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,222
高  实在是高
Good idea. Good idea.

159
00:06:31,223 --> 00:06:32,741
吉米  记得我们讨论过
Jimmy, do you remember

160
00:06:32,742 --> 00:06:34,145
当你爹妈发神经时
how we talked about not letting your parents

161
00:06:34,146 --> 00:06:36,298
我们不能总被卷进去吗
drag us into something crazy every week?

162
00:06:36,344 --> 00:06:37,792
我得去接喜旺了
Guys, I got to go pick up Hope.

163
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:41,406
我这不是在努力做一个负责的爹嘛
I am trying to be a responsible parent.

164
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,558
糟了  他要蹬上自行车了
Oh, crap, he's getting on his bike.

165
00:06:44,559 --> 00:06:46,591
我们是把卡车开来  还是徒步跟踪
Should we get the truck, or follow him on foot?

166
00:06:49,077 --> 00:06:50,024
都不用
Neither.

167
00:06:55,794 --> 00:06:56,721
我跟着呢
I got him.

168
00:07:05,365 --> 00:07:08,457
我不知道这人的真实身份  但他绝对是个土豪
I don't know who this guy is, but he must be loaded.

169
00:07:05,571 --> 00:07:11,342
三季汽车旅馆

170
00:07:08,457 --> 00:07:10,688
他住的可是三季汽车旅馆
He's staying at the Three Seasons Motel.

171
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,809
他到底在搞什么
What is he doing in there?

172
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,557
自己出谜自己猜
He's either doing solo charades

173
00:07:17,626 --> 00:07:19,165
或者打太极
or Tai Chi.

174
00:07:19,783 --> 00:07:21,717
如果谜面就是太极的话  那他就是边猜边打
Or both, if the clue is "Tai Chi."

175
00:07:21,718 --> 00:07:23,821
咱必须得承认  这人还有点意思
I got to be honest, he sounds like an interesting guy.

176
00:07:23,822 --> 00:07:25,577
我觉得他肯定是公务员
I'll bet he works for the government.

177
00:07:25,691 --> 00:07:26,694
我不明白
I just don't understand

178
00:07:26,695 --> 00:07:28,400
他干啥对我们的生活那么感兴趣
why they care so much about what we're doing.

179
00:07:28,401 --> 00:07:30,838
反正哥无聊的时候
Well, when I'm bored, I like to look up

180
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:32,257
就爱上网看看怎么造炸弹
how to build bombs on the Internet.

181
00:07:32,258 --> 00:07:34,514
九十年代  姐无聊时还爱去放点小火呢
And I was a bit of a firebug in the '90s.

182
00:07:34,515 --> 00:07:36,579
也许他跟踪我们也是有苦衷的
Maybe he's following us for a good reason.

183
00:07:37,132 --> 00:07:39,388
说不定他是黑客帝国里的人
Maybe he's one of those guys from The Matrix.

184
00:07:39,694 --> 00:07:41,568
那样他就能跟我说说黑客帝国到底是咋回事了
Then he could explain The Matrix to me.

185
00:07:42,422 --> 00:07:43,386
他要走了
Oh, he's leaving.

186
00:07:44,082 --> 00:07:45,312
机会来了
All right, here's our chance--

187
00:07:45,313 --> 00:07:47,092
我们溜进他房间  去查明此人真实身份
we're gonna break into his room and find out who he is.

188
00:07:47,093 --> 00:07:48,266
听着挺像回事儿
Sounds like a plan.

189
00:07:48,475 --> 00:07:50,031
哥只要一个打火机
All I'm gonna need is a lighter,

190
00:07:50,055 --> 00:07:51,446
一瓶洁厕剂
a bottle of toilet bowl cleaner,

191
00:07:51,447 --> 00:07:52,677
还有一老式闹钟
and an old-fashioned alarm clock.

192
00:07:52,678 --> 00:07:54,695
就能在他门上炸个洞出来
We'll blow a hole right through his door.

193
00:07:54,843 --> 00:07:58,024
或者我们可以直接用"请勿打扰"牌直接撬开门
Or we could just jimmy it open with the "Do Not Disturb" Sign.

194
00:08:03,912 --> 00:08:06,365
真豪华
Whoa! Fancy.

195
00:08:06,366 --> 00:08:08,860
摇滚明星就得在这种房间里嗑药啊
This is the type of room a rock star would O.D. In.

196
00:08:09,224 --> 00:08:10,508
来试试这个
Hey, check this out.

197
00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:11,493
咋了
What? What is it?

198
00:08:12,861 --> 00:08:14,186
全宇宙最销魂的床
The greatest bed ever made.

199
00:08:14,187 --> 00:08:14,982
你必须来试试
You got to try this.

200
00:08:14,983 --> 00:08:17,227
伯特  别这样  我们得
Burt, we can't. We got to...

201
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,170
我的神哪
Oh, my God.

202
00:08:22,915 --> 00:08:25,164
这床硬度恰好  柔软适度
It's both firm and soft.

203
00:08:25,165 --> 00:08:27,594
姐好像都看到天堂了
It's like lying on Santa Claus.

204
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:31,830
搞什么飞机
What the hell?

205
00:08:34,137 --> 00:08:35,519
姐的整个人生啊
It's, like, my whole life.

206
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,881
这太诡异了
This is creepy.

207
00:08:37,218 --> 00:08:38,386
在他回来
Let's get out of here quick,

208
00:08:38,387 --> 00:08:40,988
把我们的脸剥了做面具前  我们快溜
before he comes back and makes masks out of our faces.

209
00:08:42,784 --> 00:08:44,329
现在我也有他的照片了
Now I got a picture of him.

210
00:08:45,805 --> 00:08:48,167
哇  这张把我俩都照得不错嘛
Wow. We both looked really good in that shot.

211
00:08:48,168 --> 00:08:48,929
那倒是
You're right.

212
00:08:49,156 --> 00:08:51,480
如果他不是变态杀人狂的话
If he doesn't turn to be a weirdo pervert killer,

213
00:08:51,481 --> 00:08:53,310
我们就找他帮拍圣诞卡片照
we should have him take our Christmas card.

214
00:08:56,693 --> 00:08:59,348
做传单找出此人真实身份的主意实在太妙
Making a flyer to find out who this guy is was a great idea.

215
00:08:59,349 --> 00:09:03,012
传单  你那傻儿子又走丢了吗
Flyers? Did that dopey son of yours wander off again?

216
00:09:03,013 --> 00:09:03,803
才不是
No.

217
00:09:03,804 --> 00:09:05,263
那是谁走丢了
Well, who's lost, then?

218
00:09:05,307 --> 00:09:06,801
你家疯奶奶
Your crazy old grandmother?

219
00:09:06,802 --> 00:09:08,207
那不就是你嘛  曾奶奶
That's you, Maw Maw.

220
00:09:09,565 --> 00:09:12,488
阿诺德  快把这张照片扔出去
Arnold! Get this picture out of my house.

221
00:09:12,489 --> 00:09:13,245
你认识这人
You know who this is?

222
00:09:13,246 --> 00:09:16,564
认识  这混小子睡了我女儿
Yeah. That's the bastard who knocked my daughter up.

223
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:21,081
睡了你女儿的混蛋  那不就是
So the guy who knocked up your daughter... would be...

224
00:09:21,082 --> 00:09:22,938
-我爹  -等等我想想
- My father?!  - No. Wait.

225
00:09:27,686 --> 00:09:29,072
就是你爹
Your father!

226
00:09:29,479 --> 00:09:31,592
如果你认识此人
请拨555-0137

227
00:09:34,767 --> 00:09:37,983
我第一眼看到这个恶心男人的时候
I knew this no-good, disgusting excuse for a man was trouble

228
00:09:37,984 --> 00:09:39,537
就知道肯定没好事
the minute I laid eyes on him.

229
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:41,091
但他是我爹啊
But he's my father.

230
00:09:41,092 --> 00:09:42,739
爷爷就是你爹
Paw Paw was your father.

231
00:09:42,801 --> 00:09:45,112
阿诺德只是个道德沦丧的混蛋
Arnold's just an immoral, horrible person.

232
00:09:45,113 --> 00:09:46,993
你不会想和那种人扯上关系的
You don't want to associate with people like that.

233
00:09:46,994 --> 00:09:49,195
所以你就编了个维吉尼亚她爹
So you just made up a story about Virginia's father dying

234
00:09:49,196 --> 00:09:50,468
死在马赛中的故事
in a horse racing accident?

235
00:09:50,469 --> 00:09:51,832
你为什么要这么做啊
Why would you do that?

236
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:54,262
因为那时你想要一匹小马和一个爸爸
Because you wanted a pony and a father,

237
00:09:54,263 --> 00:09:56,447
这不是一石二鸟嘛
and it solved two problems at once.

238
00:09:58,641 --> 00:10:01,391
我们还是去找你爹吧
Well... guess we'd better go meet your dad.

239
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:04,289
不去  如果他想走进我生活的话
No way. If he wanted to be a part of my life,

240
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:06,113
他多得是机会来找我
he had plenty of chances to talk to me.

241
00:10:06,114 --> 00:10:08,445
我觉得你需要点菲尔医生总爱说的
But I think you're gonna need some of that...

242
00:10:06,114 --> 00:10:09,445
著名心理医生与主持人

243
00:10:09,098 --> 00:10:11,763
那什么感情什么东西
emotional stuff Dr. Phil's always talking about.

244
00:10:11,785 --> 00:10:16,027
就是  你不能用红柄梳子修轮胎
The... "You can't fix a flat tire with a red-handled hairbrush."

245
00:10:16,105 --> 00:10:17,086
不是这句
Nah, that's not it.

246
00:10:17,087 --> 00:10:18,575
爹  妈
Ma! Dad!

247
00:10:18,687 --> 00:10:20,875
快看看我刚为父女舞会
Check out the moves I just taught Hope

248
00:10:20,876 --> 00:10:22,543
教给喜旺的舞步
for the father-daughter dance!

249
00:10:24,634 --> 00:10:26,231
得了吧  吉米
Oh, come on, Jimmy.

250
00:10:26,242 --> 00:10:28,907
这样下去她什么时候才能学会自己跳舞
How is she supposed to ever learn to dance on her own?

251
00:10:28,908 --> 00:10:31,391
压抑小孩才能  这是哪门子的爹啊
What the hell kind of father smothers his daughter like that?

252
00:10:31,392 --> 00:10:33,196
维吉尼亚  你心情不好
Virginia, you're obviously upset.

253
00:10:33,781 --> 00:10:36,829
哥一般不喝啤酒  但一喝起来
"I don't always drink beer, but when I do..."

254
00:10:37,082 --> 00:10:39,324
不  这也不是菲尔医生说的
Nah, that's not Dr. Phil.

255
00:10:39,325 --> 00:10:42,272
拜托  顺手关门好吗  虫子都飞进来了
And for God's sake, you're letting all the bugs in. Close the door.

256
00:10:42,273 --> 00:10:44,052
了断[关闭]  就是这个了
Closure-- that's it!

257
00:10:44,115 --> 00:10:45,904
你得去见见你爹  做个了断
You got to go meet your dad for closure.

258
00:10:46,542 --> 00:10:48,093
好吧  我去
Fine, I'll go.

259
00:10:48,472 --> 00:10:50,632
但那可不是因为我信菲尔医生
But it's not because I trust Dr. Phil.

260
00:10:50,987 --> 00:10:52,143
只是在《实习医生格蕾》里
It's 'cause that closure thing

261
00:10:52,144 --> 00:10:54,100
这套理论似乎还挺管用
always seems to work on Grey's Anatomy.

262
00:10:57,392 --> 00:10:59,478
我手都开始抖了
Oh, my hand's shaking.

263
00:10:59,479 --> 00:11:01,914
自从吉米出生后  我好久都没这么紧张过了
I haven't been this nervous since Jimmy was born.

264
00:11:02,239 --> 00:11:04,042
至少生吉米时我还能抽烟缓和一下
At least I had cigarettes to get me through that.

265
00:11:04,043 --> 00:11:05,306
放松放松
Don't be nervous.

266
00:11:05,307 --> 00:11:07,164
想象一下你爹只穿内裤的样子
Just picture your dad in his underwear.

267
00:11:07,165 --> 00:11:08,724
伯特  关键是我不认识他
Burt, I've never met the man.

268
00:11:08,725 --> 00:11:10,665
不知道他穿啥样的内裤啊
I don't know what sort of underwear he wears.

269
00:11:13,052 --> 00:11:14,511
不好意思
No, I'm sorry, no, uh...

270
00:11:14,687 --> 00:11:16,968
我今天不需要家政服务  也不用修理草坪
no housekeeping or lawn care today.

271
00:11:16,969 --> 00:11:19,270
一看就知道你们是干这行的
Assuming that's what you do.

272
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,541
少废话  别以为我不知道你是谁
Cut the crap. I know who you are

273
00:11:21,542 --> 00:11:24,510
我还知道你这么多年来干的那些鬼事
and I know what you've been doing all these years,

274
00:11:24,511 --> 00:11:25,793
赶紧给我收手
and it needs to stop.

275
00:11:25,794 --> 00:11:27,468
-离我家人远点  -好
- Stay away from my family... - Okay.

276
00:11:27,469 --> 00:11:29,773
把偷拍我们的照片删干净
...and delete all those creepy pictures of us.

277
00:11:29,774 --> 00:11:31,635
然后有多远滚多远
And then I want you to go away

278
00:11:31,636 --> 00:11:33,268
别再阴魂不散了
and never come near us again.

279
00:11:34,087 --> 00:11:35,232
不过你先告诉我
Right after you tell me

280
00:11:35,233 --> 00:11:37,345
为什么一个人能够
what possible reason a person could have

281
00:11:37,346 --> 00:11:39,380
如此狠心抛弃自己年幼的宝贝女儿
to abandon his precious baby girl.

282
00:11:41,365 --> 00:11:42,258
因为我是基佬
I'm gay.

283
00:11:44,773 --> 00:11:46,286
我晕
I'm confused.

284
00:11:46,287 --> 00:11:47,626
我当年就是同性恋了
So was I, back then.

285
00:11:48,191 --> 00:11:49,645
一切都发生在后台
You see, it all started backstage

286
00:11:49,646 --> 00:11:51,478
那晚在餐厅剧院有一场《皮蓬》
after a dinner theater performance of Pippin.

287
00:11:51,479 --> 00:11:52,628
我演皮蓬
I played Pippin,

288
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:55,560
当地的评论家都盛赞我的表演可谓精彩绝伦
local critic said I was "mesmerizing."

289
00:11:55,561 --> 00:11:56,604
庆功宴后
After the cast party,

290
00:11:56,605 --> 00:11:59,658
一瓶苹果酒把我和你妈都给放倒了
your mom, me, and a bottle of apple wine--

291
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:03,084
于是我们晕头转向地进了道具室
we, made our way into the prop closet.

292
00:12:03,085 --> 00:12:04,031
维吉妮亚  这也许可以解释
Virginia, that's probably where you get

293
00:12:04,032 --> 00:12:05,669
为什么你这么喜欢喝果酒
your love of fruit-based alcohol.

294
00:12:06,516 --> 00:12:09,375
假装非常享受与那姑娘滚床单
Pretending to enjoy sex with a woman

295
00:12:09,376 --> 00:12:12,946
是我那晚的第二场精彩演出
was perhaps my second great performance that evening.

296
00:12:12,947 --> 00:12:14,349
一不小心就当上爹了
Your mom got pregnant,

297
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,373
而我
and I got...

298
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,751
我大大方方地出了柜
I got the guts to admit that I am gay.

299
00:12:18,908 --> 00:12:20,076
我也不想走
I wanted to stay,

300
00:12:20,086 --> 00:12:23,311
但1973年的纳什维尔
but no, the-the people of Natesville in 1973,

301
00:12:23,312 --> 00:12:27,877
没有我的容身之地
they did not want to be associated with, "my kind."

302
00:12:27,878 --> 00:12:30,081
这就是曾奶奶生气的原因
That's what Maw Maw was talking about.

303
00:12:30,587 --> 00:12:31,573
她恨死你了
She hates you.

304
00:12:31,574 --> 00:12:34,020
是啊  曾爷爷也不怎么高兴
Yeah, Paw Paw wasn't so thrilled either.

305
00:12:34,021 --> 00:12:35,492
你有没有尝过穿着羊绒喇叭裤
You ever tried dodging buckshot

306
00:12:35,493 --> 00:12:36,872
躲避大铅弹的滋味
in cashmere bell-bottoms?

307
00:12:36,873 --> 00:12:38,075
想想都痛苦
I can only imagine.

308
00:12:38,347 --> 00:12:40,551
我曾穿着牛仔短裤尝试过  已经很不易了
I did it in jean shorts and that wasn't easy.

309
00:12:40,981 --> 00:12:42,692
真的很抱歉
I am so sorry.

310
00:12:42,693 --> 00:12:43,877
这不是你的错
It wasn't your fault.

311
00:12:44,851 --> 00:12:45,791
是我不好
Was my fault.

312
00:12:46,343 --> 00:12:47,350
我不希望你在成长的过程中
I didn't want you to grow up

313
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:49,409
总是被人嘲笑有一个基佬爸爸
with the stigma of having a gay father.

314
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,966
我只能请求你的原谅
I can only hope you'll forgive me.

315
00:12:52,262 --> 00:12:53,296
爹地
Daddy!

316
00:12:53,297 --> 00:12:55,775
当老妈弄清楚  她爸当年为何要离开后
Once my mom understood why her dad had left,

317
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:57,568
她就没法再对他生气了
it was hard to stay mad at him.

318
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:58,567
冰淇淋

319
00:12:57,881 --> 00:12:59,756
他们也都想追回
And they both wanted to make up for lost time

320
00:12:59,757 --> 00:13:02,760
曾经错过的父女时光
doing all those father-daughter things they missed out on.

321
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,519
你的奶子就和布里的车轮一样大[法语]
Vos mamelons sont comme des roues de Brie.

322
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:09,984
他说...
He said...

323
00:13:13,609 --> 00:13:14,489
他说了啥
What'd he say?

324
00:13:35,138 --> 00:13:37,048
我还指望今晚能吃上墨西哥肉卷呢
I was really looking forward to taco night.

325
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:38,075
别这样  伯特
Oh, come on, Burt.

326
00:13:38,076 --> 00:13:39,540
你的味蕾也太单调了
Your palate is so pedestrian.

327
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:41,021
何不尝试点新鲜事物呢
Why don't you try something new?

328
00:13:41,022 --> 00:13:43,729
寿司不就是远东的墨西哥卷
Sushi is the taco of the Far East.

329
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:44,539
你看啊
Now, look.

330
00:13:46,872 --> 00:13:48,156
这里面富含蛋白质
You've got your protein,

331
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,384
和碳水化合物
you've got your rice,

332
00:13:49,385 --> 00:13:52,050
都用不着玉米饼
and instead of a corn tortilla,

333
00:13:52,107 --> 00:13:53,431
光一片海苔
it's all wrapped

334
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:55,591
便将美味与营养尽裹
in a delicious piece of mori.

335
00:13:55,592 --> 00:13:59,160
如果忽略它的制作食材的话  那就好吃多了
If you ignore-i what it's made of, it tastes p pretty good.

336
00:14:01,938 --> 00:14:03,392
海胆怎么样  伯特
How is that sea urchin, Burt?

337
00:14:05,323 --> 00:14:07,819
就好像大海在我嘴里打了个喷嚏
It's like the ocean sneezed in my mouth.

338
00:14:08,933 --> 00:14:12,326
这么多年来  我背着相机跟踪你们时
You know, all those years I've been following you guys around with a camera,

339
00:14:12,326 --> 00:14:14,019
多么渴望自己能走上来
and I feel like I've just walked

340
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,431
成为那画面中的一份子
right into the picture.

341
00:14:16,178 --> 00:14:17,921
我们应该拍张全家福
You know, we should have a family photo.

342
00:14:17,922 --> 00:14:20,115
-我最爱拍全家福了  -必须有主题
- I love family photos. - With a theme.

343
00:14:20,116 --> 00:14:22,728
带主题的全家福什么的最喜欢了
I love family photos with themes!

344
00:14:25,013 --> 00:14:28,603
纳什维尔古董博物馆

345
00:14:26,354 --> 00:14:27,425
太棒了
This is amazing.

346
00:14:27,426 --> 00:14:28,621
我最爱角色扮演了
I love costumes.

347
00:14:28,622 --> 00:14:30,048
亲爱的  我是否有幸
Oh, boy, do I have a parade

348
00:14:30,049 --> 00:14:31,635
将你永远留在这一刻
to take you to next summer.

349
00:14:31,636 --> 00:14:34,186
这肯定会是有史以来最漂亮的全家福
This is gonna be the best family photo ever.

350
00:14:34,187 --> 00:14:36,240
维吉妮亚  我得和你谈谈
Virginia, I gotta talk to you.

351
00:14:38,156 --> 00:14:39,896
超适合我的是不是
Isn't this the cat's pajamas?

352
00:14:39,897 --> 00:14:40,690
是啊
Yes.

353
00:14:40,691 --> 00:14:42,997
你就把自己的快乐建立在别人的丑态上
But only because I think cat's pajamas are stupid.

354
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:43,931
你爸爸给我挑的这身
I look like an idiot

355
00:14:43,932 --> 00:14:45,692
穿起来就像个白痴
in this thing your dad picked out.

356
00:14:45,693 --> 00:14:46,925
别这样  伯特
Oh, come on, Burt.

357
00:14:46,926 --> 00:14:48,039
多好玩啊
This is fun.

358
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,051
不  不好玩
No, it's not fun.

359
00:14:49,052 --> 00:14:51,217
阿诺德一来就没什么好事
Nothing's been fun since Arnold showed up.

360
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:52,579
你是在吃醋吗
Are you jealous

361
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,364
就因为我总是和爸爸在一起
because I'm spending time with my dad?

362
00:14:54,365 --> 00:14:55,930
不是  但我知道
No. But I just know that

363
00:14:55,931 --> 00:14:57,059
他看不惯我的行为作风
he doesn't like the way I act

364
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,081
话不投机  饭也吃不到一块儿
or what I say or what I like to eat.

365
00:14:59,167 --> 00:15:00,443
他对我简直百般挑剔
He doesn't like anything about me.

366
00:15:00,444 --> 00:15:02,040
那你希望我怎么做
So what do you want me to do?

367
00:15:02,245 --> 00:15:03,220
他是我爸爸啊
He's my father.

368
00:15:03,221 --> 00:15:05,007
我以后都不能见他了吗
Am I supposed to not see him anymore?

369
00:15:05,008 --> 00:15:06,291
我不是这个意思
I didn't say that.

370
00:15:06,632 --> 00:15:09,626
我只是希望他能离开  再也不要出现
I just would like him to go away and never come back.

371
00:15:10,032 --> 00:15:11,720
他让我觉得很不舒服  维吉妮亚
He makes me uncomfortable, Virginia.

372
00:15:11,986 --> 00:15:13,532
他跟我们不是一类人
He's just too different than us.

373
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,891
听到这里的人
Wish I could say I was surprised

374
00:15:15,892 --> 00:15:17,440
说出这样的话
to hear that kind of intolerance

375
00:15:17,441 --> 00:15:18,871
还真是意料之中
from someone in this town.

376
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,147
他就在我身后  是不是
He's right behind me, isn't he?

377
00:15:22,148 --> 00:15:24,373
伯特  这话要在人家还没开口之前就问
Burt, that only works if he hasn't said anything.

378
00:15:28,336 --> 00:15:30,548
很抱歉我跟你不是一类人  伯特
Sorry to be so different from you, Burt.

379
00:15:30,668 --> 00:15:33,773
显然你老公不赞同我的生活方式
Obviously your husband doesn't approve of my lifestyle.

380
00:15:33,774 --> 00:15:35,889
不  不  那不是我的真实想法
No, no. Honestly, I didn't mean that.

381
00:15:36,244 --> 00:15:38,031
只是你喜欢的一切
It's just that everything you like to do

382
00:15:38,032 --> 00:15:39,955
让我觉得难受不适
makes me uncomfortable or sick.

383
00:15:40,896 --> 00:15:43,271
看来想要融入你的生活是大错特错了
Trying to be a part of your life was clearly a mistake.

384
00:15:43,272 --> 00:15:45,690
我不适合演情景喜剧
I'm not one for melodrama, so...

385
00:15:46,251 --> 00:15:47,398
永别了
good-bye forever.

386
00:15:48,845 --> 00:15:49,719
伯特
Burt...

387
00:15:50,022 --> 00:15:51,773
我们刚刚父女重聚
I just got my dad back,

388
00:15:51,774 --> 00:15:53,437
你就把他赶走了
and now you drove him away.

389
00:15:53,729 --> 00:15:54,574
我能处理好的
I can fix this.

390
00:15:54,575 --> 00:15:55,951
还记得那次我打碎了你最爱的茶杯吗
Like when I broke your favorite mug.

391
00:15:55,952 --> 00:15:58,022
就是那个每次喝水  我都会头晕目眩的茶杯吗
The mug that makes me dizzy every time I drink from it?

392
00:15:58,023 --> 00:15:58,940
没错
Good point.

393
00:15:59,071 --> 00:16:01,614
我保证  这次绝不用劣质有毒胶水
I promise I will not use the same toxic glue

394
00:16:01,615 --> 00:16:02,721
来修复我和你爸爸的关系
to fix your dad.

395
00:16:05,805 --> 00:16:08,429
老爸因为阿诺德外公的事很内疚
Dad felt so bad about what happened with Grandpa Arnold

396
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:10,334
所以他不仅在全家福中出镜凹造型
that he not only posed for the family picture,

397
00:16:10,335 --> 00:16:11,555
还决定为此举办一个聚会
he decided to throw a party

398
00:16:11,556 --> 00:16:13,879
让纳什维尔的其他人都来欢迎阿诺德回家
so the rest of Natesville could welcome Arnold home.

399
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,636
他是个快乐的基佬
For he's a jolly gay fellow

400
00:16:15,637 --> 00:16:19,185
他是个开心的基佬
For he's a jolly gay fellow...

401
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,577
我原谅你们  纳什维尔人民
I forgive you, Natesville.

402
00:16:20,578 --> 00:16:22,872
这点毋庸置疑
Which nobody can deny.

403
00:16:22,873 --> 00:16:27,418
后来我舍弃了终身职位
And then I left a... a tenured position

404
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:30,116
转而去做一名自由人种音乐学家
to become a freelance ethnomusicologist.

405
00:16:30,117 --> 00:16:33,174
我曾在非洲的村落里见过一个男人
I once saw a man in a small African village

406
00:16:33,175 --> 00:16:35,216
单凭一个石头和人的牙齿
who could perform an entire symphony

407
00:16:35,217 --> 00:16:37,722
就演奏出一首完整的交响曲
using nothing but a rock and a human tooth.

408
00:16:37,723 --> 00:16:39,482
天呐  真是美妙极了
Ah... Oh! Was it amazing?

409
00:16:39,483 --> 00:16:41,920
不是  听得我想死
Oh, no, it was... it was excruciating.

410
00:16:43,431 --> 00:16:45,542
但他的努力确实值得敬佩  是吧
But you had to admire the effort, right?

411
00:16:45,543 --> 00:16:47,883
他周游列国  连加拿大都去过
He's been all over the world. Even Canada.

412
00:16:47,884 --> 00:16:49,476
学一下加拿大口音  老爸
Do your Canadian accent, Dad.

413
00:16:49,477 --> 00:16:51,074
维吉妮亚是我闺女
Virginia's my daughter, eh?

414
00:16:52,897 --> 00:16:54,380
跟在看现场版冰球赛似的[加拿大人擅打冰球]
It's like we're at a hockey game.

415
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:56,775
这是在给我过生日  还是守灵呢
This my birthday or my wake?

416
00:16:57,127 --> 00:16:57,871
把她弄进去
Go get her back inside.

417
00:16:57,872 --> 00:17:00,453
我不想让她看到我爸  然后不停地攻击同性恋
I don't want her to see my father and start gay-bashing.

418
00:17:00,454 --> 00:17:01,174
好
Okay.

419
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:03,802
给你守灵呢  你来早了
It's your wake and you're early.

420
00:17:03,803 --> 00:17:05,181
咱们进屋吧
Let's get you back inside.

421
00:17:05,701 --> 00:17:08,194
那个不要脸的混蛋怎么在这
What the hell is that depraved son of a bitch doing here?

422
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:09,544
他是我爸爸
He's my father,

423
00:17:09,627 --> 00:17:11,309
是我邀请他来的
and I invited him here.

424
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,802
这还是我家
This is still my house,

425
00:17:12,803 --> 00:17:14,780
我不想这种恶心
and I don't want that kind of disgusting,

426
00:17:14,781 --> 00:17:16,600
下流  变态
immoral, deviant...

427
00:17:18,161 --> 00:17:21,288
曾奶奶  你不能再说这种话了
Maw Maw, you can't say stuff like that anymore.

428
00:17:21,289 --> 00:17:23,990
好吗  都2013年了
Okay? It's 2013.

429
00:17:23,991 --> 00:17:26,717
我靠  老娘也活得忒久了
Damn it, this life is taking forever.

430
00:17:26,943 --> 00:17:27,784
听着
Look...

431
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:30,551
我们都接受了真正的他
we all accept my dad for who he is.

432
00:17:30,552 --> 00:17:33,942
纳什维尔的人已经不介意他是同性恋了
Nobody in Natesville cares anymore that he's gay.

433
00:17:34,431 --> 00:17:35,473
他是同性恋
He's gay?

434
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,669
我对同性恋没意见
Well, I don't have a problem with gays.

435
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,151
吉米就是同性恋  但我依然爱他
I mean, Jimmy's gay, and I love him

436
00:17:39,152 --> 00:17:40,350
还有他的小老公
and his little husband.

437
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,799
这是她对我说过的最动听的话了
Oh, that's the nicest thing she's ever said to me.

438
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,852
但那家伙
But that guy?

439
00:17:44,145 --> 00:17:46,023
他是世界第一自恋狂
He's a first-class narcissist.

440
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:47,537
自恋狂
Oh, "Narcissist."

441
00:17:47,538 --> 00:17:49,425
咱们应该都知道这词的意思吧
I think we know what that's code for.

442
00:17:49,426 --> 00:17:51,282
你哪个词没听懂
You fall asleep in the middle of sentences?

443
00:17:51,283 --> 00:17:52,235
他是个自私的混蛋
He's a selfish jerk.

444
00:17:52,236 --> 00:17:54,305
他只关心自己
He doesn't care about anybody but himself.

445
00:17:54,387 --> 00:17:55,954
这就是他离开你和你妈的原因
That's why he left you and your mother.

446
00:17:55,955 --> 00:17:57,454
他没离开
He didn't leave.

447
00:17:57,455 --> 00:17:59,567
他只是出城了  对吧
He was run out of town. Right?

448
00:17:59,903 --> 00:18:01,194
对  出城
Well, "Run out of town,"

449
00:18:01,195 --> 00:18:03,254
就是感觉不受欢迎
"Made to feel unwelcome,

450
00:18:03,255 --> 00:18:04,970
不被赏识  都一样
unappreciated..." Same diff.

451
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:06,771
我觉得不一样
I don't think it really is the same.

452
00:18:06,772 --> 00:18:07,988
说着容易
That's easy for you to say.

453
00:18:07,989 --> 00:18:10,746
你试试70年代生活在这个小镇
You try being gay and raising a child

454
00:18:10,895 --> 00:18:12,989
当个同性恋还要养个孩子
in this town in the '70s.

455
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:14,354
说到这个
You know, now that you mention it...

456
00:18:14,355 --> 00:18:17,243
我那一对女同妈妈就是70年代在这把我养大的
my lesbian mothers raised me in this town in the '70s.

457
00:18:17,244 --> 00:18:19,003
虽然  她俩中的一个得打扮成男人
Sure, one of them had to dress up like a man

458
00:18:19,004 --> 00:18:20,733
才带我去参加父子独木舟旅行
to take me on the father-son canoe trip,

459
00:18:20,734 --> 00:18:22,010
但她们都挺过来了
but they toughed it out.

460
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,352
不过这都没什么  因为她本来就有小胡子
It didn't hurt that she already had a mustache

461
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,938
和一柜子的男士衣装
and a closet full of flannels.

462
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,075
女同
Lesbians.

463
00:18:27,105 --> 00:18:28,919
女同人人爱
Everybody loves lesbians.

464
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,862
你至少可以给她写封信嘛
You could've at least written her a letter.

465
00:18:31,032 --> 00:18:32,797
但你连个电话都没打过
Or not even a phone call?

466
00:18:32,922 --> 00:18:35,146
70年代有电话的
They had phones in the '70s.

467
00:18:35,693 --> 00:18:36,721
-没错吧  -没错
- Right? - Yep. Right.

468
00:18:36,722 --> 00:18:39,476
电话公司跟同性恋...
The phone company and-and gay people...

469
00:18:39,477 --> 00:18:43,468
你分明就是拿同性恋做借口
You're clearly using your homosexuality as an excuse

470
00:18:43,608 --> 00:18:47,726
来掩盖你拒绝承担为人父责任的事实
to cover up for your refusal to accept your parental responsibilities.

471
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:49,303
对了  还没正式介绍
By the way, we haven't met.

472
00:18:49,304 --> 00:18:50,255
我是弗兰克
I'm Frank.

473
00:18:50,658 --> 00:18:51,400
幸会
It's a pleasure.

474
00:18:51,401 --> 00:18:53,315
再说一遍  纳什维尔恨我的人
Once again, the haters of Natesville

475
00:18:53,617 --> 00:18:54,682
都高昂着他们丑恶的头颅
rear their ugly heads.

476
00:18:54,683 --> 00:18:56,171
你们这群人真有意思
You know, you people are very interesting,

477
00:18:56,172 --> 00:18:58,198
就是不肯悔改
because you don't seem to be able to change, do you?

478
00:18:58,199 --> 00:19:00,612
你才是死不悔改的人吧
Maybe you're the one who hasn't changed.

479
00:19:00,841 --> 00:19:02,614
因为我想了一下
'Cause now that I'm thinking about it,

480
00:19:02,895 --> 00:19:04,275
我们这周做的所有事
everything that we've done this week

481
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:05,996
都是按照你的意愿
has been something you wanted to do.

482
00:19:06,348 --> 00:19:08,303
我们按你的意愿吃了寿司
We had that sushi dinner 'cause you wanted it.

483
00:19:08,304 --> 00:19:09,734
你提议星期二吃玉米卷
You suggested Taco Tuesday.

484
00:19:09,735 --> 00:19:11,316
你不会真想让我
Do you honestly expect me

485
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:14,242
吃移民摆的路边摊吧
to eat the street food of a migrant people?

486
00:19:14,243 --> 00:19:16,524
我们看了你挑的法国电影
We went to that French movie 'cause you picked it.

487
00:19:16,525 --> 00:19:18,375
瑞典版的爹已经看过了
Already saw the Swedish version.

488
00:19:18,376 --> 00:19:21,078
你还坚持
And you insisted

489
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:22,908
让我们拍那个主题的全家福
on the theme for our family picture.

490
00:19:22,909 --> 00:19:25,888
因为我想把照片给我的朋友们看
Because I wanted to share it with my friends.

491
00:19:26,101 --> 00:19:27,026
你还不明白吗
Don't you understand?

492
00:19:27,027 --> 00:19:30,897
你们穿成平常那样拍照
Do you honestly expect me to show a photo of-of you guys

493
00:19:30,898 --> 00:19:33,097
你真觉得这种照片拿得出手吗
dressed the way you normally do?

494
00:19:33,098 --> 00:19:33,934
对不起  我错了
Forgive me for trying

495
00:19:33,935 --> 00:19:35,735
我不该让你们显得更有格调
to raise you to a higher level.

496
00:19:38,688 --> 00:19:40,261
你可以再一次
I think you should leave...

497
00:19:41,024 --> 00:19:42,058
离开了
again.

498
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,069
但这次  是我让你离开的
But this time, it's my choice.

499
00:19:48,256 --> 00:19:49,457
永别了
Good-bye forever.

500
00:19:52,634 --> 00:19:55,183
这个我要带走  因为我照得还挺帅的
I'm gonna take this because I look fantastic.

501
00:20:01,427 --> 00:20:03,674
有时候爸爸不在你身旁
Sometimes your dad's not here

502
00:20:03,675 --> 00:20:05,727
有时候你爸是个自私的大...
Sometimes your dad's a big selfish...

503
00:20:05,728 --> 00:20:07,191
歇了吧  雪莉
Quit it, Shelley.

504
00:20:09,617 --> 00:20:12,600
那晚我爸邀请所有人来见我妈的爸爸
Dad invited everyone over that night to meet Mom's father.

505
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:16,154
但原来他们早就认识我妈的爸爸了
But in the end, it turned out they already knew her father,

506
00:20:16,243 --> 00:20:19,033
因为曾爷爷才是我妈的真爸爸
because Paw Paw was Mom's real dad.

507
00:20:28,286 --> 00:20:29,854
真遗憾
I'm sorry your gay father

508
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:32,421
你的基爹原来是个自恋狂魔
turned out to be a narcissist.

509
00:20:33,268 --> 00:20:34,201
你还好吧
You okay?

510
00:20:34,714 --> 00:20:35,511
挺好
Yeah.

511
00:20:36,846 --> 00:20:39,434
其实以前我以为爸爸是个好人
The truth is, I had a pretty good father figure.

512
00:20:40,432 --> 00:20:43,138
所以阿诺德在我小时候就离开也是件好事
And I guess it's good Arnold left when I was a baby.

513
00:20:43,484 --> 00:20:46,353
给我省了多少高档通心粉啊
Think of all the macaroni art I would have wasted on that guy.

514
00:20:46,956 --> 00:20:47,987
还有手指画
Finger-paintings.

515
00:20:47,988 --> 00:20:49,931
-烟灰缸  -难看的领带
- Ashtrays. - Ugly ties.

516
00:20:49,932 --> 00:20:51,684
他可能会给
He probably would've given me zero stars

517
00:20:51,685 --> 00:20:53,643
我为他做的父亲节早餐打零分
on the Father's Day breakfast I made him.

518
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:56,758
而且
And besides...

519
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,986
如果我正经有个爹
if I didn't have some daddy issues,

520
00:20:58,987 --> 00:21:01,211
我可能不会15岁就被搞大了肚子
I might not have got knocked up at 15.

521
00:21:01,865 --> 00:21:03,408
那样如今的我会是什么样呢
Then where would I be?
