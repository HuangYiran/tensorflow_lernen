00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,920

00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:25,500
领衔主演:安娜.金斯卡娅

00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,710

内拉·露西斯

7
00:01:54,109 --> 00:01:56,361
亲我 达里奥 求你了！
Kiss me Dario, please!

8
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,874
亲我的脖子
Kiss me on the neck.

9
00:02:20,594 --> 00:02:22,429
就像你初次吻我…
Like you used to...

10
00:02:22,606 --> 00:02:25,703
欲望高涨 激情四射地亲我
just one kiss, but sensual, passionate.

11
00:05:06,301 --> 00:05:08,136
8月26日
August 26th.

12
00:05:08,491 --> 00:05:12,349
我自己也不知道为什么深夜1点写下这些东西
I don't know why I'm writing this at one in the morning.

13
00:05:12,526 --> 00:05:15,758
我只知道如果不写出来, 我就会歇斯底里尖叫
I only know that if I don't, I'll scream.

14
00:05:15,936 --> 00:05:18,897
达里奥是个好丈夫 我也深爱着他
Dario is a wonderful husband and I love him,

15
00:05:19,074 --> 00:05:22,891
但是自从结婚以后, 与他云雨我就再难达到高潮
but since we've been married I can't reach orgasm with him.

16
00:05:23,068 --> 00:05:25,018
为什么？究竟哪里错了？
Why? What's wrong?

17
00:05:25,226 --> 00:05:28,532
我们结婚不过半年
It's only been six months since our wedding.

18
00:05:29,022 --> 00:05:33,359
那事儿似乎每况愈下, 日复一日 单调乏味
and things seem to get more boring, flavourless and banal every day.

19
00:05:33,547 --> 00:05:36,738
往日的激情 惊喜 欢乐与狂野
What happened to all the enthusiasm, surprise, fun.

20
00:05:37,228 --> 00:05:40,012
都跑到哪儿去了？
and craziness we had before?

21
00:07:29,298 --> 00:07:31,206
让我抓住 会给你们好看！
If I catch you, you're dead!

22
00:08:02,456 --> 00:08:04,782
让我来收拾你 你个小骚货！
I'll fix you, you naughty girl!

23
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:27,805
哦 爽…爽…达里奥 舔我！我的小妹妹欲火高涨啊
Oh yes...yes... Dario, lick me! My pussy's on fire.

24
00:08:29,869 --> 00:08:33,508
萨堤尔(色狼)眼前的歧途…是选择信徒通往俄摩拉城(罪恶之都)的路…
The satyr's crossroads...the Apostles' road to Gomorrah...

25
00:08:33,696 --> 00:08:36,793
还是直达所多码(罪恶之地)的污渎小道？
or the unhallowed alleyway to Sodom?

26
00:08:39,754 --> 00:08:44,092
哦 不！肉棒不能进！除非我们已经是夫妻
Oh no! Not this! Only when we're husband and wife.

27
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:55,436
哦 好爽！肏得小妹妹好爽！
Oh yes! Give it to me!

28
00:08:55,614 --> 00:08:58,982
这辈子从未这样爽过！
I've never come so much in my life!

29
00:10:01,617 --> 00:10:04,287
昨天文学节上 有人把它硬塞给我
They foisted it on me at the Literature Festival yesterday.

30
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:08,739
你帮我看看 我相信你的眼光, 达里奥留言
Why not take a look at it? You know I trust your judgement. Dario.

31
00:10:08,854 --> 00:10:13,118
附言：你睡得正香，我不想叫醒你！
PS: You were sleeping so peacefully I didn't want to wake you up!

32
00:10:14,005 --> 00:10:16,809
我还没反应过来，就被他压在身下
"I found myself pressed against him without realising it.

33
00:10:16,997 --> 00:10:20,365
我俩双唇紧贴 他的舌头贪婪地在我嘴里搅动
His mouth glued onto mine, his tongue scavenging greedily,

34
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:23,983
甚至想直捣我炙热的喉咙
pushing itself into my parched throat.

35
00:10:24,161 --> 00:10:27,278
我无法呼吸，却又无法抗拒
I couldn't breathe, but I didn't break away.

36
00:10:27,466 --> 00:10:31,731
我的胸脯感觉到他肌肉的起伏, 充斥着我呼吸的 尽是他的气味
I felt his muscles rippling against my breasts. I breathed in his smell.

37
00:10:32,857 --> 00:10:35,735
我充耳所闻 尽是那些舞者的呻吟
The groans of the dancers filled my ears

38
00:10:35,922 --> 00:10:39,739
有人对我低语说我是个婊子
and someone whispered that I was a whore.

39
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:42,950
但这一切 似乎对我都已无关紧要
But it all seemed so insignificant to me.

40
00:10:43,117 --> 00:10:46,110
我的全部注意力集中在
The stranger's hand under my skirt

41
00:10:46,287 --> 00:10:49,102
陌生的手伸进我的裙下 放在臀间
and on my ass was all that I cared about.

42
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,752
那对笨拙而又强壮的手掌拉着我, 让我紧贴他的腹部
Those strong, blundering hands that pressed me to his stomach

43
00:10:53,283 --> 00:10:55,640
逼着我用身体摩擦他那话儿
and compelled me to rub myself against his cock,

44
00:10:55,817 --> 00:10:59,008
那玩意儿好生粗大 膨胀得像要夺裤而出
which seemed ready to burst out of his trousers.

45
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,699
还是那双手 突破我亵裤的防线
Those same hands that invaded my panties

46
00:11:02,887 --> 00:11:04,899
我的仙人洞可怜地落入它的掌握
and grabbed my pussy.

47
00:11:05,076 --> 00:11:09,174
在我花瓣间翻江倒海的那只巧手仿佛发出阵阵箭簇
His finger shot between my cunt lips like an arrow.

48
00:11:09,352 --> 00:11:13,387
我的花径湿得一片狼籍 蓬门顺从地洞开, 他没有遭遇任何抵抗
I was moist, open, yielding, he didn't meet any resistance.

49
00:11:13,564 --> 00:11:17,672
直到现在我还感觉到他笨拙的手指在我的屄里抽插
I can still feel it now, his clumsy finger on my pussy

50
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,832
一股冷颤直冲脊背 依旧令我回味无穷
and the cold shiver that ran down my spine.

51
00:11:21,009 --> 00:11:23,710
我三下五除二 解除他的裤子
I undid his trousers

52
00:11:23,897 --> 00:11:26,254
踢掉我的鞋子
and kicked off my shoes.

53
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:28,861
我呼吸短促 屄缝溢满甜蜜的汁液
My breath was short and my pussy was wet.

54
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,416
我肆无忌惮 毫无羞耻
I felt free to show my eagerness

55
00:11:32,938 --> 00:11:35,440
展示我膨胀的欲望
and my desire without shame."

56
00:12:44,165 --> 00:12:45,302
在这儿呢
Here it is.

57
00:13:54,235 --> 00:13:57,113
这书让你昏昏欲睡？我不会怪罪你睡觉
The book made you nod off? I don't blame you for sleeping.

58
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:00,106
这次文学节简直无聊透顶！
The Literature Festival is a total drag!

59
00:14:00,283 --> 00:14:03,380
你要不就去德泰宫观赏景致？
Why don't you visit Palazzo Te?

60
00:16:47,221 --> 00:16:48,983
你好放肆！
How dare you!

61
00:16:56,052 --> 00:16:58,378
你干什么？放开我！
What are you doing? Leave me alone!

62
00:17:01,516 --> 00:17:04,394
你喜欢这些壁画 嗯？
You like the frescoes, huh?

63
00:17:14,915 --> 00:17:16,333
瞧他俩在干啥？
Do you see those two?

64
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:26,656
孩子们 集中精力看壁画！
Kids? Look at the frescoes!

65
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:30,034
我们是来这儿研究朱利奥·罗曼诺的, 用心点！
We're here to study Giulio Romano, pay attention.

66
00:17:38,918 --> 00:17:41,139
他真可爱！
He is cute though!

67
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,223
多可爱的奶头！
Those lovely little tits!

68
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,675
迷人的小屄！
That lovely little pussy!

69
00:18:38,728 --> 00:18:41,324
快点 我们要迟到了！
Hurry up, we're late!

70
00:18:46,548 --> 00:18:47,873
你还在等什么？
What are you waiting for?

71
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,669
有件事想跟你说说…
I've got to tell you something...

72
00:18:53,889 --> 00:18:56,923
怎么 把我的信用卡刷爆了？
You've gone over the limit on my credit card?

73
00:18:58,341 --> 00:19:00,396
那个…我…
Well...I...

74
00:19:16,266 --> 00:19:20,051
你还好吧？我当然不忙
Hello? Of course I'm not busy!

75
00:19:20,228 --> 00:19:22,282
我该怎么开口？
How can tell him?

76
00:19:23,992 --> 00:19:26,526
难道照直说亲爱的 今天我做了对你不忠的事
Today I cheated on you, my love.

77
00:19:28,371 --> 00:19:31,364
老公 我给你戴绿帽了！
Darling, I've been unfaithful!

78
00:19:34,221 --> 00:19:36,922
达里奥…我私通野汉
Dario...I'm an adulteress.

79
00:19:43,334 --> 00:19:45,211
你刚才说什么？
Well? You were saying?

80
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,985
我想跟你说…
I wanted to tell you...

81
00:19:48,235 --> 00:19:50,831
我们非得出席这个宴会吗？
Do we really have to go to this party?

82
00:19:51,196 --> 00:19:54,773
这可是开幕盛典 难道你想要他们炒我的鱿鱼？
It's the grand opening, do you want them to fire me?

83
00:19:55,305 --> 00:19:59,496
届时宾客济济 其中有著名作家, 你会有乐趣的
There'll be lots of guests, famous writers, you'll have fun.

84
00:19:59,684 --> 00:20:02,291
好无聊啊！
What a drag!

85
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:08,578
就像你们东北那边说的 “生意终归是生意”
As you say in the North-East, "Business is business."

86
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:13,385
乖啊 别磨磨蹭蹭
Come on, hurry up.

87
00:20:24,042 --> 00:20:27,066
我今天差点被人强奸了！
I was nearly raped today!

88
00:20:36,043 --> 00:20:39,307
我说 我这娇艳迷人的玉门关…
I said this lovely little pussy

89
00:20:39,484 --> 00:20:42,779
被人硬捅进去了 好比鸟儿被穿在烤肉叉上
was speared like a bird on a skewer.

90
00:20:48,462 --> 00:20:50,016
你听见没有 老公！
Did you hear, darling?

91
00:20:50,964 --> 00:20:53,884
我说我被人强奸了！
I said that I was raped!

92
00:20:54,061 --> 00:20:56,011
我晓得啦！
I understood!

93
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,295
差点还是既成事实？
Nearly or actually?

94
00:20:58,451 --> 00:21:00,432
你不相信我的话？
You don't believe me?

95
00:21:00,745 --> 00:21:05,427
我当然信 宝贝. 谁干的好事？那个酒店的摩洛哥侍应？
Of course I do, darling. Who by? That Moroccan waiter in the hotel?

96
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,816
不 是个陌生人
No, by a stranger.

97
00:21:09,128 --> 00:21:10,828
就在德泰宫
At Palazzo Te.

98
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:15,072
这是被老公疏忽的老婆做的白日梦吧？
The fantasies of a neglected wife?

99
00:21:15,395 --> 00:21:18,023
你听着 我甚至还觉得很爽
Look, I even enjoyed it!

100
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,150
哦 是吗？
Oh, really?

101
00:21:20,369 --> 00:21:24,529
既然你这么玩世不恭, 今天的派对干脆别穿内裤出席
Seeing as you're so outrageous, don't wear any panties to the party.

102
00:21:25,165 --> 00:21:28,356
你当我不敢么！
You say it as if I wouldn't be capable!

103
00:21:28,544 --> 00:21:31,495
快点 你要累我迟到了！
Come on, you'll make me late!

104
00:21:33,695 --> 00:21:35,843
滚你妈的！
Fuck off!

105
00:22:21,075 --> 00:22:24,902
我想让一个情人站在另一个情人面前说
I'd like to place one lover in front of the other and say:

106
00:22:25,841 --> 00:22:27,863
这是当代趋势吗？
is this the current trend?

107
00:22:28,103 --> 00:22:30,919
心灵再也不能承受重负
The heart can no longer shoot its load.

108
00:22:31,482 --> 00:22:33,421
臀部是伟大的平等主义者
The ass is a great leveller.

109
00:22:33,953 --> 00:22:36,278
阴户是心灵的眼睛！
The pussy is the minds eye.

110
00:22:36,487 --> 00:22:38,395
粗鄙不堪！
How vulgar!

111
00:22:40,386 --> 00:22:43,379
一点也不！能指是真正的标志！
Not at all! The signifier is the real signified!

112
00:22:43,379 --> 00:22:43,994
注:一种语言学理论,语言有两个组成部分:所指和能指;
所指即文字能指即此文字对应的符号或概念

113
00:22:44,036 --> 00:22:47,790
如此说来 “情欲”去除所有文化价值后就成了“色情”
Eroticism loses all cultural value that way, it becomes pornography.

114
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:51,064
大师 是否“色情”就是“情欲”?
Is it true, maestro, that pornography is to eroticism

115
00:22:51,554 --> 00:22:53,014
“吹箫”其实就是“口淫”？
what the blow job is to fellatio?

116
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,830
诚然如此 这只是语义学和语言学的问题
Exactly, it's just a matter of semantics and language.

117
00:22:57,153 --> 00:22:59,207
简单点说 就是舌头的活儿！
Of tongues, if anything!

118
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:03,514
艺术成为色情 或者说反之亦然？
Does art become pornography or vice versa?

119
00:23:04,077 --> 00:23:08,529
你的出版社能赚个盆满钵盈 还正是靠了性
Sex is the only thing that keeps your publishing houses a float.

120
00:23:08,706 --> 00:23:11,595
还有《圣经》 那从来都是最畅销的书
And the Bible, it's always the number one seller.

121
00:23:11,772 --> 00:23:15,620
宗教 性 暴力, 这些就是成功的秘诀 为此干杯！
Religion, sex, excess, a recipe for success! Cheers!

122
00:23:57,797 --> 00:23:59,497
住手！
Stop it!

123
00:24:00,477 --> 00:24:02,385
会被人家看见的
They can see us.

124
00:24:15,304 --> 00:24:19,194
《青楼情史》一个月就卖了20万本！
"Whores in Love". 200,000 copies in a month!

125
00:24:19,402 --> 00:24:21,769
-这位是…？ -麦克斯·扎诺克
- Who? - Max Zanouk.

126
00:24:22,572 --> 00:24:26,878
最有前途的作家之一
One of our most promising authors.

127
00:24:27,827 --> 00:24:30,006
恭喜你了
Ah, congratulations.

128
00:25:04,009 --> 00:25:06,084
你会料到在这儿见着我么…
You expected to see me here...

129
00:25:06,272 --> 00:25:09,744
-求求你 别在这儿 -你居然是真空上阵！
- Please, not here. - You've got no panties on!

130
00:25:10,265 --> 00:25:13,300
那又如何 不过是在跟我丈夫斗气
So what, it's just to spite my husband.

131
00:25:13,467 --> 00:25:16,657
-这里水漫金山也是由于赌气吗？ -别碰我
- Is that why you're all wet too? - Leave me alone.

132
00:25:16,845 --> 00:25:18,962
那是因为我酒喝多了
It's all the wine I've drunk.

133
00:25:19,316 --> 00:25:23,477
我早就想找你了
I've looking for you.

134
00:25:32,882 --> 00:25:34,967
你在听吗?
Are you listening.

135
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:39,138
-玛尔塔·贝托鲁奇 -西维娅
- Marta Bortoluzzi - Silvia

136
00:25:40,504 --> 00:25:42,652
再次见到你可真高兴！
How nice to see you again!

137
00:25:42,871 --> 00:25:45,822
-文学节期间你一直在吗？ -是的 直到周日
- Staying for the whole festival? - Yes, till Sunday.

138
00:25:45,999 --> 00:25:47,907
太好了！
Wonderful!

139
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:50,378
-达里奥呢？ -他也来了
- And Dario? - He's here too.

140
00:25:52,088 --> 00:25:54,070
你丈夫呢？
And your husband?

141
00:25:54,247 --> 00:25:57,198
亨利不幸得留守巴黎…
Unfortunately Henry's had to stay in Paris...

142
00:25:57,375 --> 00:26:00,399
你也知道…出版社这块…
You know how it is... work, the publishing house.

143
00:26:00,753 --> 00:26:02,662
我是和弗朗索瓦一起来的
I'm here with François,

144
00:26:03,193 --> 00:26:06,593
-亨利的秘书 你还记得他吗？ -当然记得
- His secretary. Remember him? - Of course.

145
00:26:06,812 --> 00:26:09,689
你婚礼那天他也去了托尔切洛
He was at Torcello the day you got married.

146
00:26:09,908 --> 00:26:13,308
不过…我们似乎来得不是时候？
But...did we interrupt something?

147
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:17,061
哪里的话 我正要上洗手间
No, not at all. I'm on my way to the bathroom.

148
00:26:17,249 --> 00:26:19,501
-陪我去吗？ -好啊
- Will you come with me? - I'd love to!

149
00:26:20,023 --> 00:26:22,171
我有好多话想跟你聊呢
We've got so much to talk about.

150
00:26:55,589 --> 00:26:56,976
恭喜你啦！
Congratulations!

151
00:26:57,883 --> 00:27:01,846
-什么时候学会不穿内裤外出的？ -不是你想的那回事儿
- When did you start going without? - It's not what you think.

152
00:27:02,054 --> 00:27:03,962
-真的吗？ -真的！
- Oh, no? - No!

153
00:27:04,181 --> 00:27:08,248
-都怪达里奥 -你懂得这么玩 真难得！
- It's Dario's fault. - You're lucky you play those games!

154
00:27:09,051 --> 00:27:10,365
跟你说了 不是那回事儿
I told you, it's not like that.

155
00:27:10,542 --> 00:27:13,733
其实 我和他之间不太协调
In fact, things aren't going too well between us.

156
00:27:14,473 --> 00:27:17,956
-你是指床上那回事儿？ -我跟他云雨不出高潮来了
- You mean in bed? - I can't orgasm with him anymore.

157
00:27:18,758 --> 00:27:20,906
这很正常呀 甜心！
But that's normal, darling!

158
00:27:21,084 --> 00:27:24,243
每个人迟早都会那样
It happens to everyone sooner or later!

159
00:27:24,775 --> 00:27:26,850
-我也一样 -那你怎么办？
- It happened to me too. - And what did you do?

160
00:27:27,069 --> 00:27:31,521
你以为我为啥会跟弗朗索瓦来文学节？
Why do you think I came to the festival with François?

161
00:27:32,043 --> 00:27:34,232
他可不光是亨利的秘书
He's not just Henry's secretary,

162
00:27:34,451 --> 00:27:38,716
那方面才是妙用无穷！
he's an incredible stud!

163
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,615
你对丈夫不忠就没有罪恶感？
You feel guilty for cheating on your husband?

164
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,369
罪恶感归罪恶感 可我就是觉得爽极了
There's guilt and guilt. I feel really good.

165
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:51,176
事实上 出轨之后我跟亨利之间还更有进步
In fact, so good that things have even improved with Henry.

166
00:27:51,354 --> 00:27:55,483
-哪方面？ -各个方面 甚至床上
- In what way? - Every way. Even in bed.

167
00:27:56,056 --> 00:28:00,363
亲爱的玛蒂娜 嫉妒是疗效最佳的春药
Jealousy, my dear Martina, is the strongest aphrodisiac.

168
00:28:00,571 --> 00:28:04,398
没有什么东西比猜忌…
There's nothing better than suspicion

169
00:28:04,575 --> 00:28:07,943
更能重新点燃伴侣对你的欲望 相信我！
to rekindle your partner's desire, believe me!

170
00:28:08,548 --> 00:28:11,113
找个可以肏得你爽翻天的男人
Find someone who'll give you a good fucking.

171
00:28:11,812 --> 00:28:14,762
对达里奥来说 没有比这更好的礼物了
You couldn't give Dario a better present.

172
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:19,017
就比如…刚才那个陪着你的男人
Someone...like that man you were with, for example.

173
00:28:20,028 --> 00:28:24,126
可我只是今晚才认识他的, 甚至都不知道他叫什么！
But I only met him this evening, I don't even know his name!

174
00:28:24,616 --> 00:28:28,505
有时候 名字和时间长短并不重要
Sometimes you don't need names or a long time.

175
00:28:29,068 --> 00:28:33,719
看长短要看另一方面…
You need something else that's long...

176
00:28:34,084 --> 00:28:38,077
可是…背着达里奥跟别的男人偷情…
But... to be unfaithful to Dario, screw with someone else...

177
00:28:38,255 --> 00:28:40,851
-我都无法确认自己能否做到 -你能的 甜心
- I don't know if I could. - You could, darling.

178
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:45,522
你肯定行 不是说所有男人都对你“见花泄”
You could. The notorious "quick one"!

179
00:28:46,012 --> 00:28:48,160
不过你得有分寸
You've just got to do it right.

180
00:28:48,348 --> 00:28:52,686
-啥意思？ -要分清主次
- Meaning? - Get your priorities right.

181
00:28:53,072 --> 00:28:55,991
-什么主次？ -要合情合理
- What priorities? - The legitimate ones.

182
00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:00,621
我从来只让弗朗索瓦走后门
I only let François use the rear entrance.

183
00:29:01,048 --> 00:29:03,999
至于前面嘛 却是时刻留给亨利享用的
The front one is reserved for Henry.

184
00:29:06,262 --> 00:29:09,213
你可真是个荡妇！
You're such a slut!

185
00:29:18,545 --> 00:29:22,883
恭喜 小姐们, 屁股可不光是用来排泄的
Congratulations, ma'am. The ass isn't just for making poo-poo.

186
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:27,481
正如男人们在我那里面说的, 绰绰有余！
And as they say in my neck of the woods, it hasn't got a meter!

187
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:07,698
这双高跟鞋好伤我的脚
These heels have ruined my feet!

188
00:30:13,798 --> 00:30:14,664
可是…
But...

189
00:30:15,915 --> 00:30:17,969
-怎么了？ -你的内裤呢？
- What is it? - Your panties?

190
00:30:18,522 --> 00:30:20,398
-我没穿 -我看得见 那你的内裤哪去了？
- I'm not wearing any. - l can see, where are they?

191
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:24,569
-我之前根本就没穿  -什么意思？
- I didn't put any on. - What do you mean?

192
00:30:25,101 --> 00:30:28,219
你不记得啦？是你赌我敢不敢不穿的
You were the one who dared me to, remember?

193
00:30:29,314 --> 00:30:33,724
你敢归敢啊 要是被人察觉怎么办？
There are dares and dares. What if someone had noticed?

194
00:30:33,975 --> 00:30:36,894
要是我告诉你当真有人发现了呢？
What if I tell you they did?

195
00:30:46,424 --> 00:30:50,908
-你这么说是什么意思？ -跳舞时总有些手不太规矩
- What do you mean by that? - Hands can wander during a dance.

196
00:30:51,263 --> 00:30:54,287
就一件薄薄的丝裙 有什么摸不出来
You can feel everything through a silk dress!

197
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:57,383
是那个跟你跳舞的狗杂种？
That son of a bitch who danced with you!

198
00:30:57,561 --> 00:31:00,970
-你认识他？ -我才不会跟这种人扯上关系！
- You know him? - I don't mix with people like that!

199
00:31:01,804 --> 00:31:04,724
那你干嘛怒气冲天？
Why get so hot under the collar then?

200
00:31:04,901 --> 00:31:07,373
这种鸟人只要看看脸谱 就知道是龟公 舞男…
You can see in his face that he's a whoremonger, a gigolo

201
00:31:07,894 --> 00:31:09,385
肮脏的变态！
and a filthy pervert!

202
00:31:09,708 --> 00:31:12,617
难怪说男人不坏 女人不爱
That must be why women find him attractive.

203
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:32,241
你可别说喜欢上他了！
Don't say you like him!

204
00:31:32,418 --> 00:31:36,141
我也是个女人 对不对？
Well, I'm a woman too, aren't I?

205
00:31:37,121 --> 00:31:39,790
-可你首先是我妻子 -是么！
- First of all, you're my wife. - You don't say!

206
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,262
我差点忘了
I'd forgotten.

207
00:31:42,439 --> 00:31:45,598
那种男人只会对婊子感兴趣
Men like that are only interested in whores.

208
00:31:45,786 --> 00:31:49,185
从他揉捏我的方式看 我肯定也是婊子了
From the way he was squeezing me, I must be a whore too.

209
00:31:49,717 --> 00:31:52,772
你今晚究竟怎么了？
Anyway, what's got into you this evening?

210
00:31:53,231 --> 00:31:57,016
没什么 我不过是想告诉你发生了什么
Nothing, I just wanted to tell you what happened.

211
00:31:57,370 --> 00:32:01,437
我看你朝着他笑 当时就想警告你
l saw you smile at him and l wanted to warn you.

212
00:32:01,614 --> 00:32:05,472
你看到我笑了？那你还看到点别的没有？
You saw me smile? Well then, you didn't see anything.

213
00:32:05,785 --> 00:32:07,975
难不成我还应该看到点什么？
What else should I have seen?

214
00:32:08,507 --> 00:32:11,697
比方说 他摸了我的屁股
He touched my ass, for example.

215
00:32:11,875 --> 00:32:14,617
-你是不是有点过分了？ -我？
- Aren't you going too far? - Me?

216
00:32:15,149 --> 00:32:19,184
是他过分才对 他把手伸到我裙子底下
He went too far, he put his hand under my skirt.

217
00:32:19,361 --> 00:32:23,522
-他发现你没穿内裤？ -他还摸了我的屄
- He found out you had no panties? - He touched my pussy.

218
00:32:24,022 --> 00:32:26,587
-那你干什么了？ -我让他伸进两根手指
- What did you do? - I let him stick two fingers in.

219
00:32:27,077 --> 00:32:31,248
-你当时肯定春水泛滥了 -简直堪比威尼斯水城涨潮
- I'm sure you were all wet. - Like Venice at high tide.

220
00:32:32,896 --> 00:32:35,742
-他胀起来没有？ -堪比铁棍！
- Did he get a hard on? - And how!

221
00:32:36,618 --> 00:32:38,797
-比你硬多了！ -你俩入港没有？
- Stiffer than yours! - Did you fuck?

222
00:32:38,975 --> 00:32:42,238
别紧张 你不是觉得这样太过分了？
Take it easy, don't you think that's going too far?

223
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:44,845
玛尔塔 你都让我快疯了
Oh, Marta, you drive me crazy.

224
00:32:45,064 --> 00:32:49,026
-等等 我们就在这儿干 -站着搞？畜生才会这样
- Wait, let's do it here. - Standing up? That's for animals.

225
00:32:49,204 --> 00:32:51,570
-这有什么？ -床上比这舒服多了
- What's wrong with that? - The bed's more comfortable.

226
00:32:51,883 --> 00:32:53,510
过来 我忍不住了
Come on, I'm desperate.

227
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:08,859
谁啊？
Who is it?

228
00:37:09,036 --> 00:37:11,289
贝托鲁奇太太 您有信
A message, Mrs Bortoluzzi.

229
00:37:12,999 --> 00:37:14,427
稍等！
Just a moment!

230
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:38,034
-对不起 我没零钱 -没关系 太太
- Sorry, I don't have any change. - That's all right, ma'am.

231
00:37:51,579 --> 00:37:57,668
12点钟 “猪船”上见.  附注：当然别穿内裤！-莱昂
12 o'clock at "The Pig's Boat",  PS: No panties, of course! Leon.

232
00:38:03,966 --> 00:38:06,041
神经病！不过…
What a nerve! But...

233
00:38:07,584 --> 00:38:09,732
莱昂…好听的名字！
Leon... nice name!

234
00:38:12,214 --> 00:38:13,351
都11点了！
It's eleven!

235
00:38:39,001 --> 00:38:41,431
我今天整日都会呆在外国文学馆
I'll be in the Foreign Literature Pavilion all day.

236
00:38:41,618 --> 00:38:44,246
你要是觉得无聊就过来找我 , 我爱你.. 达里奥
If you get bored, why not drop in? I love you, Dario.

237
00:38:44,601 --> 00:38:47,176
附注：这回记得穿好内裤！
PS: Wear some panties this time!

238
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,709
我该如何是好？
What should I do?

239
00:38:48,886 --> 00:38:52,463
去“猪船”还是外国文学馆？
"The Pig's Boat" or foreign literature?

240
00:38:52,848 --> 00:38:54,965
找莱昂还是达里奥？
Leon or Dario?

241
00:38:55,705 --> 00:38:58,135
穿还是不穿内裤？
Panties or no panties?

242
00:39:16,925 --> 00:39:19,771
做选择题最讨厌！
It's a drag having to choose!

243
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:50,917
您早！
Good morning!

244
00:39:51,271 --> 00:39:53,315
找人吗？
Looking for someone?

245
00:39:53,628 --> 00:39:55,505
嗯…是的
Well... yes.

246
00:39:55,682 --> 00:39:58,675
我找一位法国人 莱昂先生
A French gentleman, Monsieur Leon.

247
00:39:58,852 --> 00:40:02,011
-他应该订过席位 -好的 女士 这边请
- He should have a booking. - Of course, ma'am. This way.

248
00:40:12,459 --> 00:40:14,597
-要不要边等边喝点什么？ -不了 谢谢
- A drink while you're waiting? - No, thanks.

249
00:40:14,962 --> 00:40:16,515
您随便
As you wish.

250
00:40:16,943 --> 00:40:19,049
忘掉普奇尼 罗西尼和贝利尼！
Forget Puccini, Rossini and Bellini!

251
00:40:19,414 --> 00:40:21,489
威尔第 只有威尔第 永远的威尔第！
Verdi, only Verdi. Verdi forever!

252
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:32,563
可是和《塞维尔的理发师》根本没法比…
But there's no comparison with "The Barber..."!

253
00:41:11,112 --> 00:41:13,656
算了 我还是来杯马提尼酒
I've changed my mind. A Martini.

254
00:41:13,823 --> 00:41:15,804
-苦艾酒要红还是要白？ -红吧
- Vermouth? White or red? - Red.

255
00:41:16,023 --> 00:41:17,483
马上就来 女士
Right away, ma'am.

256
00:42:00,307 --> 00:42:01,339
再来一杯！
Another one!

257
00:42:01,735 --> 00:42:03,748
-还要红的？ -白的！
- Red? - White!

258
00:42:58,094 --> 00:43:01,253
你崇拜的罗西尼何时写出过这样的…
When did your Rossini ever write anything like...

259
00:43:21,023 --> 00:43:22,973
侍应 买单！
Waiter, the bill!

260
00:43:37,696 --> 00:43:39,708
再来一杯！红酒
Another one! Red.

261
00:43:43,358 --> 00:43:47,529
谢谢
Thank you!

262
00:44:11,469 --> 00:44:15,296
-想让我独自一人进餐吗？ -王八蛋！你足足迟到1个小时
- Want me to eat alone? - Bastard! You're an hour late.

263
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:17,486
要怪就怪…
Blame it on...

264
00:44:19,821 --> 00:44:22,783
满脑子臭屁又没胆量鸡蛋里挑骨头的家伙！
Cowardly nitpickers with farting brains!

265
00:44:26,265 --> 00:44:28,309
除非你有问必答 否则我可不原谅你
I'll only excuse you if you tell me something.

266
00:44:30,259 --> 00:44:33,105
你怎么晓得我住哪家酒店？
How did you know which hotel I'm staying at?

267
00:44:34,607 --> 00:44:36,682
经纪人都住那家
Managers always go to that one.

268
00:44:37,047 --> 00:44:40,488
那么好色淫乱 脾气糟糕的法国佬又住哪家呢？
Where do horny, bad mannered Frenchmen go?

269
00:44:40,801 --> 00:44:43,345
就住在经纪人太太们的两腿之间
Between the legs of the managers wives.

270
00:44:46,754 --> 00:44:47,766
打扰一下…
Excuse me...

271
00:44:48,141 --> 00:44:50,581
填馅意大利面条 还有烤鸭 两份
Stuffed pasta and roast duck for two.

272
00:44:51,832 --> 00:44:54,012
要不要来点蔬菜？
And some vegetables?

273
00:44:56,566 --> 00:44:58,089
我们上洗手间吧
Let's go to the bathroom.

274
00:44:58,412 --> 00:45:00,591
-厕所？ -那边
- The toilet? - Through there.

275
00:45:03,344 --> 00:45:05,367
抱歉！马提尼喝多了…
Excuse me! The Martini...

276
00:45:19,391 --> 00:45:20,945
我的报告…
My report...

277
00:45:24,959 --> 00:45:26,826
放他妈哪儿了？
Where the fuck is it?

278
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:33,517
7月20日 我们结婚四个月后渐渐起了些变化
July 20th, we've been married four months. Something's changed.

279
00:46:33,872 --> 00:46:36,020
达里奥不再那么在意我
Dario is less attentive towards me

280
00:46:36,208 --> 00:46:39,304
而且他肏起我来不再像以前那样激情澎湃
and he doesn't fuck me like he used to.

281
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:41,880
8月13日
August 13th.

282
00:46:42,224 --> 00:46:44,414
达里奥根本不晓得我在写日记
Dario doesn't know about this diary.

283
00:46:44,622 --> 00:46:47,719
就算在他鼻子底下写 他也毫无觉察
It's quite easy to write in it right under his nose.

284
00:46:48,032 --> 00:46:51,786
说不定我随便跟哪个上了床 他也会这样懵懵懂懂
Maybe it's just as easy to go to bed with other men.

285
00:47:02,546 --> 00:47:04,246
8月26日
August 26th.

286
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:08,146
我自己也不知道, 为什么深夜1点写下这些东西
I don't know why I'm writing this at one in the morning.

287
00:47:08,323 --> 00:47:11,618
我只知道如果不写出来 我就会歇斯底里尖叫
I only know that if I don't, I'll scream.

288
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:14,402
达里奥是个好丈夫 我也深爱着他
Dario is a wonderful husband and I love him.

289
00:47:14,579 --> 00:47:18,125
但是自从结婚以后, 与他云雨我就再难达到高潮
But since we've been married, I can't reach orgasm with him.

290
00:47:18,343 --> 00:47:20,700
为什么？究竟哪里错了？
Why? What's wrong?

291
00:47:20,919 --> 00:47:24,141
我们结婚不过半年
It's only been six months since our weddings

292
00:47:24,495 --> 00:47:27,613
那事儿似乎每况愈下
and things seem to get more boring, flavourless and banal

293
00:47:27,978 --> 00:47:29,292
日复一日 单调乏味
every day.

294
00:47:29,615 --> 00:47:32,493
往日的激情 惊喜 欢乐与狂野
What happened to all the enthusiasm, surprise, fun

295
00:47:32,816 --> 00:47:35,965
都跑到哪儿去了？
and craziness we had before?

296
00:47:40,814 --> 00:47:42,305
8月27日
August 27th.

297
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:45,777
差点被达里奥当场抓到我手淫
Dario almost caught me masturbating.

298
00:47:45,965 --> 00:47:48,843
我听到他开门进来 就赶紧装睡
I pretended to be asleep when I heard him come in.

299
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:51,564
他看见我玉体横陈 有备而睡
He saw me naked and ready on the bed

300
00:47:51,773 --> 00:47:55,412
却连碰都不碰我 他对我已经没有激情了？
but he didn't even touch me. Has he gone off me?

301
00:48:04,609 --> 00:48:08,852
不 我知道他还爱着我 可他就是不来攻占娘子关
No, I know that he loves me, but he doesn't screw me.

302
00:48:09,207 --> 00:48:12,794
就算他来肏了 我反倒觉得不如不肏！
And when he does I'd prefer it if he didn't!

303
00:48:12,961 --> 00:48:16,224
8月28日 我得好好理清头绪
August 28th. I've got to get my head in order.

304
00:48:16,621 --> 00:48:20,781
一定是德泰宫那些壁画的缘故 朱庇特(罗马保护神)的大鸡巴
It must be those frescoes at Palazzo Te, Jupiter's hard cock.

305
00:48:21,313 --> 00:48:23,429
对 鸡巴 我说的是鸡巴！
Yes, cock. I said, cock!

306
00:48:23,784 --> 00:48:27,423
说出来的感觉真好！鸡巴！鸡巴！鸡巴！
It's wonderful to say it! Cock! Cock!

307
00:48:27,642 --> 00:48:30,708
真想在阳台上大声叫出来——鸡巴！
I want to shout it from the balcony. Cock!

308
00:48:31,886 --> 00:48:35,118
假如让达里奥知道我都写了些什么 一定很好玩！
It'd be funny if Dario knew what I wrote in here!

309
00:48:35,473 --> 00:48:39,602
我还差点让自己被一个陌生人干了屄
I almost allowed myself to be screwed by a stranger.

310
00:48:39,967 --> 00:48:42,104
他一巴掌拍在我的屁股上
He slapped my ass

311
00:48:42,323 --> 00:48:44,409
在我欣赏朱利欧·罗马诺的壁画时
while I was looking at Giulio Romano's frescoes.

312
00:48:44,659 --> 00:48:47,234
要不是那群学生突如其来
If that group of students hadn't shown up,

313
00:48:47,412 --> 00:48:50,602
我的屄说不定就让那陌生人肏了
I'd have let that stranger fuck me.

314
00:48:56,275 --> 00:48:59,465
说来也巧 当晚的文学节宴会上 我又见到了他
As luck would have it, I saw him at the festival party.

315
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:02,604
他一把捉住我的手臂 把我拖进舞池
He grabbed me by the arm and dragged off to dance.

316
00:49:02,959 --> 00:49:05,732
其实他是醉翁之意 我也一样！
He didn't care about dancing and neither did I!

317
00:49:06,087 --> 00:49:08,203
他想找个隐蔽的角落
He wanted to find a secluded corner

318
00:49:08,391 --> 00:49:12,906
好乘没有旁人和我丈夫看见 肏我的屄
where he could screw me without the others and my husband seeing.

319
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:16,138
就在达里奥的附近偷情 很够刺激！
What a turn on to do it with Dario nearby!

320
00:49:16,493 --> 00:49:18,641
他没有给我喘息时间
He didn't give me time to catch my breath.

321
00:49:18,829 --> 00:49:22,259
发现我没穿内裤 立即把手指插进我的水帘洞
He realised I had no panties on and slid a finger in my pussy.

322
00:49:22,864 --> 00:49:27,483
当他按住我的头 把鸡巴凑到面前时 我也没有拒绝
I didn't resist when he pushed my head down onto his dick.

323
00:49:28,494 --> 00:49:30,152
臭贱人！
Rotten slut!

324
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:33,458
原来她在浴室说的话不是幻觉！
So she wasn't just fantasising in the bathroom!

325
00:49:37,608 --> 00:49:40,736
等我们回到酒店 达里奥也被燃起欲火
Dario had a hard on too when we got back to the hotel.

326
00:49:41,090 --> 00:49:43,520
他有点奇怪 表现得很不安
He was weird, agitated.

327
00:49:43,697 --> 00:49:46,658
就像他目睹了什么 还想进一步了解情况
It was as if he'd seen something and wanted to know more.

328
00:49:46,836 --> 00:49:48,911
我听从了西维娅的建议
I followed Silvia's advice:

329
00:49:49,088 --> 00:49:53,957
什么都别告诉他 表现得规规矩矩 但就是要让他疑神疑鬼
don't tell him everything, appear honest, but leave him in doubt.

330
00:49:54,281 --> 00:49:55,740
8月30日
August 30th.

331
00:49:56,085 --> 00:49:57,742
我终于知道他的名字了
I finally know his name.

332
00:49:57,930 --> 00:50:00,005
真是命运的巧安排 他叫莱昂
By a quirk of fate, he's called Leon,

333
00:50:00,401 --> 00:50:03,519
和达里奥给我看的书中男主人公的名字一样
like the man in the book that Dario gave me to read.

334
00:50:03,707 --> 00:50:05,719
他本不该给我看那本书的
He shouldn't have given it to me.

335
00:50:06,074 --> 00:50:09,890
玩火者必自焚
If you play with fire, you're going to get burned.

336
00:50:10,213 --> 00:50:13,310
莱昂邀我到河边一条美食船上共进午餐
Leon invited me to lunch at an eatery by the river.

337
00:50:13,477 --> 00:50:17,126
还要我不穿内裤！我本来就不想穿的
No panties! I wouldn't have worn them anyway.

338
00:50:17,481 --> 00:50:21,610
我觉得自己有点不要脸 但和莱昂在一起 我什么都愿意做
I feel shameless, with Leon I'm willing to do anything.

339
00:50:21,798 --> 00:50:25,437
尽管如此 我并不觉得有什么罪恶感 达里奥并没有失去我
Above all, I don't feel guilty, Dario's not losing out.

340
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:29,128
和莱昂在一起 不过像在品尝从未尝过的食物
With Leon it's like eating food I've never tasted before.

341
00:50:29,451 --> 00:50:31,182
我一定要跟西维娅说说这事
I've got to tell Silvia about it,

342
00:50:31,474 --> 00:50:34,623
我安排好跟她一起去阿巴诺(意大利温泉胜地)
I've arranged to go to Abano with her.

343
00:52:15,078 --> 00:52:17,549
小心点 你这样会留下痕迹！
Careful, you'll leave a mark!

344
00:52:33,794 --> 00:52:34,983
好爽
Hot

345
00:52:34,983 --> 00:52:39,018
-你干嘛？ -留个印记啊
- What are you doing? - Leaving a mark.

346
00:52:39,018 --> 00:52:43,179
不要 莱昂 不要
No...Leon...no!

347
00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:51,531
巴隆 布特列 索林 你们在哪？哥伦布 夯歌 毕加索 还有你
Barron,Butlerov,Sorin, where are you? Colombo, Hangle, Picasso, and you...

348
00:52:54,669 --> 00:52:58,840
宝贝 你的屁股夹得我好爽 别叫了…
Baby, you get me so hot ass clip. Hush...

349
00:53:00,728 --> 00:53:03,355
你的屁股快让我爽死了！
I want to go crazy up your ass!

350
00:53:22,124 --> 00:53:23,886
现在放松
Now relax.

351
00:53:24,074 --> 00:53:27,296
一会我们拿些石子来做“石头疗法”
We'll be back later with some rocks for the "Stone Therapy".

352
00:53:28,005 --> 00:53:32,165
[法语]滚蛋吧

353
00:53:32,488 --> 00:53:35,408
-你真相信那种疗法吗？ -狗屁!
- Do you believe that therapy works? - Like fuck!

354
00:53:35,585 --> 00:53:38,536
我相信鸡巴胜过相信石子
I believe in cocks not rocks!

355
00:53:40,006 --> 00:53:43,479
要是这儿能有人让我们爽到潮吹可多好！
Imagine if there was someone here to get us nice and wet!

356
00:53:43,802 --> 00:53:47,274
别说了 西维娅！我的面膜都要笑裂了
Cut it out, Silvia! You'll make me crack my mask!

357
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:51,299
来个半小时“比翼双飞式”(法语)舔阴
Half an hour of cunnilingus in the "poulet rôti"!

358
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:53,562
-什么式？ -“比翼双飞式”(法语)
- In the what? - Poulet rôti!

359
00:53:54,093 --> 00:53:56,346
-我最喜欢的体位 -怎样的体位？
- My favourite position. - Which one is it?

360
00:53:56,638 --> 00:53:57,774
就是这样…
This one...

361
00:53:59,630 --> 00:54:02,227
像烤鸡！
The roast chicken!

362
00:54:04,291 --> 00:54:06,887
-我懂了！ -我看你还是不懂
- I get it! - I don't think you do!

363
00:54:07,075 --> 00:54:10,099
要真正弄懂 你最好亲自去试试
You have to try it to know what I mean.

364
00:54:10,276 --> 00:54:12,330
要不就今晚 和达里奥…
Maybe tonight, with Dario...

365
00:54:12,674 --> 00:54:15,698
算了吧 我和他之间还能有什么新意
You said it! There's nothing to try with him!

366
00:54:16,011 --> 00:54:18,336
我还差点忘了！
I was forgetting!

367
00:54:19,494 --> 00:54:22,612
那就和你宴会上认识的那位炮友试试啊
Well then, do it with your friend from the party.

368
00:54:23,498 --> 00:54:26,720
-他叫莱昂是吗？ -你怎么知道？
- His name's Leon, isn't it? - How do you know?

369
00:54:26,939 --> 00:54:31,391
刚才按摩师揉你屁股时 你喃喃自语说的
You said it while the masseuse was rubbing you.

370
00:54:31,704 --> 00:54:35,009
当时在想他那双魔手了 是不是？
You were thinking about his hands, weren't you?

371
00:54:35,218 --> 00:54:37,991
何止想他的手！
Not just his hands!

372
00:54:39,222 --> 00:54:41,797
你们入过港了？
So you've done it!

373
00:54:44,331 --> 00:54:46,417
我听从了你的建议
I followed your advice.

374
00:54:46,636 --> 00:54:48,648
好样的 玛尔蒂娜！
Well done, Martina!

375
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:51,880
-感觉如何？ -你说的一点没错
- How did it go? - You were right.

376
00:54:52,235 --> 00:54:55,780
我都好几个月没享受过这样的高潮了！
I'd not had an orgasm like that for months!

377
00:54:55,989 --> 00:54:57,490
没错吧！
See!

378
00:54:57,834 --> 00:54:59,951
快从实招来 有多详细说多详细
Come on, I want all the details.

379
00:55:00,128 --> 00:55:04,779
我完全照你说的做 而且还很好地把握了分寸
I did exactly as you said, I got my priorities right.

380
00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:06,562
太棒了！
Fantastic!

381
00:55:07,333 --> 00:55:10,628
-他是不是对你感激流涕了？ -才怪！
- And did he appreciate it? - Did he ever!

382
00:55:10,983 --> 00:55:15,154
-是他主动要走后门的 -这头贪婪的猪！
- He was the one who wanted it! - The greedy pig!

383
00:55:17,844 --> 00:55:19,992
你们在哪入港的？
Where did it happen?

384
00:55:20,378 --> 00:55:23,047
-他的鸡巴长什么样？ -你问那么清楚干嘛？
- What's his dick like? - Why all these questions?

385
00:55:23,235 --> 00:55:28,792
你对他的兴趣未免过分点了吧？
Aren't you showing a bit too much interest in him?

386
00:55:29,116 --> 00:55:31,170
有什么啊？毕竟…
Why not? After all...

387
00:55:31,858 --> 00:55:35,049
我可是不介意玩玩3P的
I wouldn't mind a little threesome.

388
00:55:35,413 --> 00:55:37,488
你…他…
You, him...

389
00:55:38,469 --> 00:55:39,897
还有我…
and me...

390
00:55:40,982 --> 00:55:42,890
我可是很有天分的
I'm very talented, you know.

391
00:55:43,067 --> 00:55:46,164
肯定比刚才那按摩师还厉害
Even better than your masseuse.

392
00:55:47,936 --> 00:55:50,116
这我不怀疑 不过…
I don't doubt it, but...

393
00:55:50,335 --> 00:55:52,973
假如你想的话 我甚至可以叫上弗朗索瓦
I'll bring François along if you want.

394
00:55:53,776 --> 00:55:55,861
他的舌功可是一流
He's great with his tongue.

395
00:55:59,031 --> 00:56:00,564
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

396
00:56:00,668 --> 00:56:03,546
擅自剥脱面膜吗？
Taking your masks off by yourselves?

397
00:56:03,692 --> 00:56:04,943
躺下！
Lie down!

398
00:56:14,651 --> 00:56:17,716
西维娅的面膜很利索地脱落了下来！
Well, Silvia's mask had definitely been stripped off!

399
00:56:18,311 --> 00:56:21,407
可跟她交谈一点帮助都没有
But talking to her hadn't done much good.

400
00:56:21,574 --> 00:56:24,390
她满脑子想的就只有性 比我还差劲
All she thinks about is sex. She's worse than me.

401
00:56:24,567 --> 00:56:27,455
我 她和莱昂玩3P…去她的！
Me, her and Leon... like hell!

402
00:56:27,632 --> 00:56:30,166
要是莱昂更喜欢她怎么得了？
What if he prefers her over me?

403
00:56:35,807 --> 00:56:39,248
我怎么了？在嫉妒么？莫非我堕入爱河了？
What's happening, am I jealous? Am I falling in love?

404
00:56:39,665 --> 00:56:42,408
难道他不只是个让我愉悦的性工具？
Isn't he just supposed to be a stud to service me?

405
00:56:42,762 --> 00:56:45,609
天 我现在可真是乱成一团麻！
Oh dear, I've got myself into a real mess!

406
00:56:50,530 --> 00:56:53,617
嗨 甜心 今天怎么回来这么早？
Hi darling, how come you're back so soon?

407
00:56:58,351 --> 00:57:00,081
-你在给谁写信？ -没有啊
- Who are you writing to? - No one.

408
00:57:00,436 --> 00:57:03,595
不过是在记录些流水帐
I'm making out a list of things to do.

409
00:57:03,919 --> 00:57:05,723
-比方说？ -就一些傻事
- Like? - Just silly things.

410
00:57:06,463 --> 00:57:09,205
去参观维吉尔(古罗马诗人)的陵墓
Visiting Virgil's mausoleum,

411
00:57:09,382 --> 00:57:13,376
去诺瓦拉利博物馆看曼特尼亚的壁画
going to the Nuvolari museum, seeing Mantegna's frescoes.

412
00:57:13,553 --> 00:57:16,515
那你不打算跟我去文学节？
So you're not thinking of coming to the festival?

413
00:57:16,932 --> 00:57:19,924
你知道我会很没趣的！
You know it bores me!

414
00:57:23,094 --> 00:57:26,764
-你今天都做了些什么？ -出去走动了一下
- What did you do today? - I was out and about.

415
00:57:27,161 --> 00:57:28,965
去哪儿？
Where?

416
00:57:29,392 --> 00:57:31,467
去了阿巴诺
I went to Abano.

417
00:57:32,072 --> 00:57:34,428
-去干什么？ -你问这个干嘛？
- What for? - Why do you ask?

418
00:57:34,606 --> 00:57:36,931
问你问题 你就给我老实作答 臭婆娘！
I asked you a question, answer me, bitch!

419
00:57:40,518 --> 00:57:42,770
-去做泥浴… -跟谁？
- A mud-bath treatment... - Who with?

420
00:57:44,282 --> 00:57:45,700
西维娅
Silvia.

421
00:57:46,294 --> 00:57:49,068
你要防着她点！还跟谁在一起？
Be careful of her! Who else went with you?

422
00:57:49,422 --> 00:57:51,894
没了 就我俩
No one, it was just us two.

423
00:57:52,353 --> 00:57:56,513
我们先在蒙塔格纳纳吃午饭 然后就去了阿巴诺
We had lunch in Montagnana and then we went to Abano.

424
00:57:57,013 --> 00:57:58,296
当然了
Sure.

425
00:57:58,546 --> 00:58:01,007
哪家餐厅吃的？
What was the restaurant called?

426
00:58:01,362 --> 00:58:04,552
或者只是个小饭店？食物可口吗？
Or was it an eatery? Was the food good?

427
00:58:04,667 --> 00:58:07,764
我记不得了 我们就匆匆吃了份快餐
I can't remember, we just had a quick snack!

428
00:58:07,941 --> 00:58:09,745
那之前呢？
And before?

429
00:58:10,725 --> 00:58:12,800
-什么之前？ -今天早上
- Before what? - Before, this morning.

430
00:58:12,873 --> 00:58:15,939
你去见西维娅之前都干了些什么
What did you do before meeting Silvia?

431
00:58:17,888 --> 00:58:18,994
没干什么
Nothing.

432
00:58:19,213 --> 00:58:21,840
就睡觉 醒来后冲了个淋浴
I slept, took a shower.

433
00:58:22,205 --> 00:58:24,906
好老套的谎言！
The usual lies!

434
00:58:25,365 --> 00:58:27,388
-你怎么这样说？ -因为我了解你
- Why do you say that? - Because I know you.

435
00:58:27,554 --> 00:58:29,150
-你不相信我？ -是
- Don't you believe me? - No.

436
00:58:29,473 --> 00:58:31,725
我今天回过酒店来拿份报告 可你当时不在
I came back here for my report and you were out.

437
00:58:31,913 --> 00:58:34,822
-可能我当时正在淋浴  -去你娘的！
- l must have been in the shower. - Like fuck you were!

438
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:37,710
-我只不过想幽默一下  -可是这并不好笑！
- It was a joke.  - It wasn't funny!

439
00:58:37,929 --> 00:58:40,526
-我又不是故意这样  -难道不是吗？
- That wasn't what I intended.  - It wasn't?

440
00:58:40,849 --> 00:58:45,051
那你的目的是什么？被人干 或许？
What was your intention? To get fucked, perhaps?

441
00:58:45,479 --> 00:58:49,264
你有病吗？怎么能这样说话？
Are you mad? How can you say that?

442
00:58:49,483 --> 00:58:53,601
文学节把你冲昏头了是不是？你到底想怎样？
This festival's gone to your head, what the hell do you want?

443
00:58:53,789 --> 00:58:56,229
我就想知道你今天被谁肏了！
To know who screwed you today!

444
00:58:56,542 --> 00:59:00,358
就冲你肏我那德性 我早就该找个替用！
The way you screw I should have got someone else!

445
00:59:01,828 --> 00:59:02,840
骚货！
Slut!

446
00:59:08,303 --> 00:59:09,763

贱人！
Slut!

448
01:01:25,764 --> 01:01:28,120
荡妇…她是淫娃荡妇！
Slut... she's a slut!

449
01:01:31,572 --> 01:01:33,230
肮脏的贱货！
Filthy slut!

450
01:01:58,328 --> 01:02:01,101
臭婊子！你就是个贱货！给我滚下车！
Dirty whore! You're just a slut! Get out of the car!

451
01:02:01,289 --> 01:02:03,823
-我做错什么了？ -别让我再见到你 臭婊子！
- What did I do? - Get out of my sight, you bitch!

452
01:02:04,136 --> 01:02:06,012
不 达里奥 求求你
No, Dario, please.

453
01:02:07,545 --> 01:02:11,747
你这贱人就属于这里 就去马路上做街鸡吧！
That's were you belong, you cow! Whoring around in the road!

454
01:02:15,584 --> 01:02:19,745
达里奥！
Dario!

455
01:02:56,292 --> 01:02:58,377
西维娅！
Silvia!

456
01:02:58,377 --> 01:03:02,340
西维娅！莱昂！
Silvia! Leon!

457
01:03:02,548 --> 01:03:03,904
你们在干什么？
What are you doing?

458
01:04:39,656 --> 01:04:41,710
今晚文学节有个闭幕晚宴

I'd like you to be there. I'm sorry about yesterday.

460

假如之前对你有所疏忽 我保证以后不会再这样--达里奥手笔
And if I've been neglecting you, it won't happen again.

461
01:04:55,484 --> 01:04:57,538
他读过吗？
Did he read it?

462
01:05:28,538 --> 01:05:32,698
曼图亚酒店 莱昂

463
01:05:41,165 --> 01:05:43,386
喂 我是玛尔塔 我想和你见见
It's Marta, I've got to see you.

464
01:05:43,574 --> 01:05:45,649
(你之前怎么不给我电话？)
Why didn't you call me before?

465
01:05:46,035 --> 01:05:49,163
-我没机会 我要和你谈谈  -(说吧)
- I couldn't. I need to talk to you.  - Talk.

466
01:05:49,486 --> 01:05:51,884
-不是电话里讲 要当面谈  -(你现在在哪？)
- Not like this, face to face.  - Where are you?

467
01:05:52,541 --> 01:05:54,689
在酒店
In the hotel.

468
01:05:54,877 --> 01:05:57,942
(想像我跟你在一起 你穿着衣服吗？)
Pretend I'm there with you. Are you dressed?

469
01:05:58,109 --> 01:06:01,175
-穿着睡衣 怎么了？  -(睡衣下面呢？)
- I'm in my negligee, why?  - And underneath?

470
01:06:01,873 --> 01:06:03,218
赤身裸体
I'm naked.

471
01:06:04,449 --> 01:06:07,598
(抚摸自己 轻轻捏自己的乳头 想象是我的双手在你身上游走)
Touch yourself. Squeeze your tits, imagine my hands on your body.

472
01:06:08,276 --> 01:06:09,933
莱昂 拜托！
Leon, please!

473
01:06:11,331 --> 01:06:15,157
(还记得我鸡巴的味道吗？ 想象它就在你的喉管进出)
Remember how my cock tastes? Imagine it in your throat.

474
01:06:15,512 --> 01:06:19,057
光靠想象不够 我要你真枪实弹
Imagining is not enough, I want you in the flesh.

475
01:06:19,443 --> 01:06:23,186
-(就像在洗手间那样？) -就像在洗手间

- Not before two though.  - That's fine, where?

480
01:06:41,882 --> 01:06:43,467
(波利特街308号“里格莱托膳宿公寓”)
"Pension Rigoletto", 308, Via delle Bollette.

481
01:06:49,817 --> 01:06:53,977
好吧 到时见
Okay, see you later.

482
01:07:23,663 --> 01:07:26,510
我不需要这些
Well, I won't need them.

483
01:07:50,701 --> 01:07:53,443
别抽什么大麻了！赶快把你的大家伙掏出来！
Forget that little joint! Get the big one out!

484
01:08:04,194 --> 01:08:08,052
我迫不急待地想见莱昂 就提早离开酒店
I was so eager to see Leon  that I left the hotel early.

485
01:08:13,766 --> 01:08:17,551
我就像发情的猫咪 不停地想找点东西来摩擦阴户
I was like a cat in heat that wanted  to rub against something.

486
01:08:21,940 --> 01:08:25,204
我穿上件性感惹火的衣裳
I put on a sexy, provocative dress.

487
01:08:27,123 --> 01:08:31,398
我强烈而又果断地相信自己 感受着命运由我一手操纵
I felt strong, decisive, sure of myself and mistress of my destiny.

488
01:08:50,959 --> 01:08:53,138
我开始飘飘欲仙
My senses were heightened.

489
01:08:53,357 --> 01:08:55,755
或许他们会以为我是瘾君子
Maybe they thought I was a drug addict.

490
01:08:56,068 --> 01:08:57,570
这么想也不算离谱
They weren't far off the mark.

491
01:08:58,195 --> 01:09:00,625
不过让我上瘾的是性
But my addiction is to sex.

492
01:09:00,979 --> 01:09:03,753
我的过瘾良药叫莱昂
My drug is called Leon.

493
01:10:52,028 --> 01:10:53,905
有人在吗？
Is there anyone here?

494
01:10:57,669 --> 01:11:00,411
不用理睬她 她不过就是件家具
Ignore her, she's part of the furniture.

495
01:11:00,589 --> 01:11:02,434
婆婆…
Grandma?

496
01:11:03,206 --> 01:11:04,228
瞧
See?

497
01:11:04,666 --> 01:11:07,095
她这儿有毛病 需要效劳吗？
She's out of it. Can I help you?

498
01:11:08,701 --> 01:11:11,297
-我和一位莱昂先生有约  -莱昂？
- I have an appointment with Mr Leon.  - Leon who?

499
01:11:11,694 --> 01:11:12,788
一个法国人

500
01:11:14,405 --> 01:11:17,251
哦 那个画光屁股女人的
Yes, the one who draws naked women.

501
01:11:20,942 --> 01:11:24,488
他在房里 二楼九号房
Yes, he's in his room.  Number nine, on the second floor.

502
01:11:25,603 --> 01:11:26,990
那边请
That way.

503
01:11:32,464 --> 01:11:33,559
谢了
Thanks.

504
01:12:44,515 --> 01:12:46,288
这模特是谁？
Who's the model?

505
01:12:46,528 --> 01:12:48,937
伊芳德芙
Yvonne Dove.

506
01:12:48,937 --> 01:12:50,605
好美…
Beautiful...

507
01:12:50,605 --> 01:12:52,409
你肏过她吗？
Did you do it?

508
01:12:57,007 --> 01:12:58,071
还有男模？
And the man?

509
01:13:02,054 --> 01:13:03,472
让你亢奋吗？
Does it turn you on?

510
01:13:04,692 --> 01:13:07,466
你的一切都会让我亢奋
Everything about you does.

511
01:13:08,206 --> 01:13:12,366
好 过来坐我这儿
Please come and sit here.

512
01:13:18,925 --> 01:13:21,177
我们不能这样下去
We can't keep on like this.

513
01:13:22,095 --> 01:13:23,711
我是有夫之妇
I've got a husband.

514
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:28,518
这就是你不穿内裤的理由？
Is that why you're not wearing any panties?

515
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:40,561
莱昂…肏我…求你…
Screw me, please...

516
01:13:41,854 --> 01:13:44,315
我的“莫娜”好像火烧火燎
My "mona" feels like it's burning.

517
01:13:45,785 --> 01:13:47,276
莫娜？
mona?

518
01:13:47,276 --> 01:13:48,778
我的“莫娜”
My "mona".

519
01:13:50,102 --> 01:13:52,239
就是这里…这是威尼斯方言
This...in Venetian dialect.

520
01:13:53,084 --> 01:13:57,255
“莫娜” 好美的词语  “莫娜” 真的好美
“mona” beautiful words,  “mona” really beautiful

521
01:14:07,181 --> 01:14:09,163
这个叫“oseo”
And this is the "oseo".

522
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:20,257
你根本就不想乖乖做个良家妇女
You've no intention of behaving like a good wife.

523
01:14:21,414 --> 01:14:24,188
一天到晚就想被男人肏
You want to get fucked all day long.

524
01:14:27,952 --> 01:14:30,830
你想要个金枪不倒的种马
You want a stallion with a permanent hard-on.

525
01:14:31,810 --> 01:14:33,166
像你一样
Like you.

526
01:14:38,317 --> 01:14:42,175
你一闻到坚挺的鸡巴 就张开双腿…
You open your legs as soon as you smell a hard cock...

527
01:14:57,909 --> 01:15:00,120
进我体内来！
Come inside me!

528
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:06,387
摸过你屁股的人你都肯给他干！
You say yes to whoever touches your ass!

529
01:15:08,305 --> 01:15:09,244
对…
Yes...

530
01:15:10,464 --> 01:15:11,850
我就是荡妇
I'm a slut.

531
01:16:07,833 --> 01:16:09,679
好口渴
My throat's dry.

532
01:16:25,403 --> 01:16:27,843
我去给你拿点喝的
I'll get you something to drink.

533
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:33,156
真不错
Wonderfully.

534
01:18:33,510 --> 01:18:35,950
这是特别为你准备的
This is especially prepared for you.

535
01:18:35,950 --> 01:18:39,777
莱昂 谢谢你！
Oh, Leon, thanks!

536
01:18:39,777 --> 01:18:40,434
抬起头来
Head up!

537
01:18:40,434 --> 01:18:43,041
-蒙上眼干嘛？  -因为…
- Why?  - Because.

538
01:18:50,486 --> 01:18:52,508
你想做什么？
What do you want to do?

539
01:19:28,763 --> 01:19:32,924
不会有事的 就照几张相 来！
There'll be alright as some picture, come on!

540
01:19:40,244 --> 01:19:42,329
很好
Good.

541
01:19:42,329 --> 01:19:46,490
太好了 屁股摆一下
Good,  ass put it.

542
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:50,254
拱起背来
Arch your back.

543
01:19:53,809 --> 01:19:57,980
太棒了
Great.

544
01:19:57,980 --> 01:20:02,151
酷一点 来个酷点的
A little cool, more...

545
01:20:04,382 --> 01:20:07,615
我想拍下你肏屄时候的样子
I'd like to photograph you while you're fucking.

546
01:20:10,514 --> 01:20:14,674
别动
Hold

547
01:20:22,098 --> 01:20:25,643
-是谁？  -来送饮料的
- Who's that?  - He's brought something to drink.

548
01:20:53,265 --> 01:20:55,903
-谁啊？  -别担心
- Who is it?  - Don't worry.

549
01:20:56,403 --> 01:20:57,790
相信我
Trust me.

550
01:21:11,324 --> 01:21:13,233
真解渴啊
I needed that.

551
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:17,341
他到底是谁？
Who the fuck is it?

552
01:21:31,365 --> 01:21:34,285
-他上不上镜？  -上镜极了 心肝
- Is he photogenic?  - Yes, my dear.

553
01:21:34,462 --> 01:21:36,297
会很喜欢的 等着瞧吧
You'll love it, you'll see.

554
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,023
我全身酸疼
I'm sore all over.

555
01:23:59,367 --> 01:24:01,557
慢慢就好了
It'll wear off soon.

556
01:24:15,196 --> 01:24:19,127
-你就不嫉妒？  -嫉妒谁？那门房？
- Aren't you jealous?  - Who of? The porter?

557
01:24:19,930 --> 01:24:23,569
他不过就是个“振荡器”  帮我们提升激情的辅助品而已
He was just a "vibrator", a sex aid for our passion.

558
01:24:25,393 --> 01:24:27,646
文学节今晚就闭幕了
The festival ends tonight.

559
01:24:29,324 --> 01:24:32,421
我丈夫想要跟我一起参加闭幕晚宴
My husband wants me to go  to the party with him.

560
01:24:34,966 --> 01:24:38,782
可是…我不知道…回到米兰
But... I don't know... it won't be easy to go back to Milan,

561
01:24:38,959 --> 01:24:41,670
回归日常生活
back to everyday life.

562
01:25:00,950 --> 01:25:03,525
这个会有助于你 我的爱
This will help you, mon amour.

563
01:25:05,757 --> 01:25:07,321
呵 莱昂…好美…
It's beautiful.

564
01:25:13,514 --> 01:25:15,423
你真美
You are beautiful.

565
01:25:16,361 --> 01:25:18,655
今晚我要你陪我
You'll spend tonight with me.

566
01:25:42,074 --> 01:25:45,661
-我们开始先来个五万册…  -失陪一下
-We'll buy fifty thousand books first.  -Excuse me.

567
01:25:46,245 --> 01:25:47,350
我们回米兰再讨论吧
We'll discuss it in Milan.

568
01:25:47,538 --> 01:25:50,489
记住啊 圣诞节可是快到了！
Remember, Christmas isn't far off!

569
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:58,049
-西维娅  -是达里奥
-Silvia.  -It's Dario.

570
01:25:59,821 --> 01:26:00,989
-玛尔塔呢？  -你不知道？
- Where's Marta?  - You should know!

571
01:26:01,177 --> 01:26:03,325
-怎么跑来问我？  -我以为她和你在一起
- You're asking me?  - I thought she was with you.

572
01:26:03,544 --> 01:26:05,452
她关手机了
Her cell phone's off.

573
01:26:06,150 --> 01:26:08,653
或许她是不想和你说话
Maybe she didn't want to talk to you.

574
01:26:12,344 --> 01:26:16,160
-你丈夫呢？  -你问他怎么了？
- What about your husband?  - What about him?

575
01:26:16,901 --> 01:26:19,226
他当然是在巴黎啦
He's in Paris, of course.

576
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:23,439
我不理解她究竟发生了什么
I don't understand what's happened to her.

577
01:26:23,929 --> 01:26:28,204
亲爱的达里奥 女人要的是被男人占有
Women, my dear Dario, want men to take them,

578
01:26:28,663 --> 01:26:30,571
而不是被理解！
not understand them!

579
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:46,209
-看见她吗？
-她那浪臀可真惹火
- Seen her?
- She's got a fantastic ass.

580
01:27:54,561 --> 01:27:55,948
打个小小的赌如何？
How about a little bet?

581
01:28:12,266 --> 01:28:14,383
让她见识见识你的本事
Show her what you're made of!

582
01:28:22,078 --> 01:28:23,924
这个大傻屄！
What an asshole!

583
01:29:05,434 --> 01:29:08,729
-大家都在盯着看  -谁还管他们
- Everyone's looking.  - Who gives a damn?

584
01:29:15,944 --> 01:29:19,417
-抛开一切 跟我走吧  -什么行装都不拿？
- Leave everything and come with me.  - Without taking anything?

585
01:29:19,938 --> 01:29:21,596
到巴黎再买就是了
You can shop in Paris.

586
01:29:22,096 --> 01:29:25,193
起码让我回酒店拿几条内裤
At least let me get some panties from the hotel.

587
01:29:25,433 --> 01:29:27,696
你一到丈夫身边就有去无回了
lf you go up to your husband, you won't come back.

588
01:29:28,707 --> 01:29:30,824
我会回来的…
I'll come...

589
01:29:31,564 --> 01:29:33,149
你等着瞧
You just see if I don't.

590
01:29:40,021 --> 01:29:41,887
不 我毫不后悔
No, I don't regret anything.

591
01:29:42,064 --> 01:29:45,443
“你的手在他的肉棒上揉搓 使它硕硬无比”
"Rub your fingers on his stick to make it nice and thick",

592
01:29:45,964 --> 01:29:49,196
我会一边偷窥男生们撒尿一边欢快地哼唱这旋律
I'd sing that rhyme with glee spying on boys as they took a pee.

593
01:29:49,405 --> 01:29:50,688
好多根鸡巴…
So many cocks...

594
01:29:51,188 --> 01:29:54,410
一个糟老头在我回家的路上一路跟着我
A old man dragging his balls followed me all the way home.

595
01:29:54,598 --> 01:29:57,788
“你的小屄长毛没有？” 他含混不清地问
"Is your little pussy furry?" he asked, his speech all slurry.

596
01:29:57,966 --> 01:30:00,155
上床时我担忧 恐惧…
I shook with fear and dread...

597
01:30:00,687 --> 01:30:03,982
浑身颤抖 却在抚摸我的蜜穴
but I stroked my pussy when I went to bed.

598
01:30:13,731 --> 01:30:17,339
你不是第一个肏我屁眼的人
You're not the first one who's stuck it up my ass.

599
01:30:17,558 --> 01:30:19,737
温柔点 会痛 我说道
Be gentle, I said, it hurts.

600
01:30:19,925 --> 01:30:22,699
在这儿射最安全 他说
It's the safest place to come, he said,

601
01:30:22,876 --> 01:30:24,899
然后拼命往里面顶
pushing it all the way in.

602
01:30:25,107 --> 01:30:27,850
当他拔出鸡巴时 上面沾满屎
He pulled it out covered in shit.

603
01:30:28,027 --> 01:30:31,218
我的屁眼在屄眼之前被开了苞
Deflowered in the ass before the pussy.

604
01:30:46,431 --> 01:30:47,640
真是个贱货…
What a slut...

605
01:30:47,828 --> 01:30:50,080
我们都是那样
We're all like that.

606
01:30:50,570 --> 01:30:52,823
我们都有自己的价值
We've all got our values.

607
01:30:53,010 --> 01:30:56,159
这只是时间 地点和大小的问题
A matter of time, place and size.

608
01:30:56,347 --> 01:30:59,058
一个周日的清晨 我和一个医生…
With a doctor one Sunday morning

609
01:30:59,235 --> 01:31:01,216
在诊所还没开门的时候
when the clinic was closed.

610
01:31:01,425 --> 01:31:03,792
他要我把它含进嘴里
He wanted me to put it in my mouth.

611
01:31:04,282 --> 01:31:07,400
那话儿好大 我觉得我都吞不进去
It was so big I didn't think I'd be able to.

612
01:31:07,587 --> 01:31:10,059
还有在海滩暗房和一个摄影师
With a photographer in his booth at the beach,

613
01:31:10,549 --> 01:31:12,759
打着看照片的借口
with the excuse of looking at photos.

614
01:31:12,947 --> 01:31:15,929
他是有妇之夫 但手指相当灵巧
He was married, but very talented with his finger.

615
01:31:16,878 --> 01:31:20,069
在音乐会的楼上包厢和一位同学
With a schoolmate in the upper-tier-box at a concert.

616
01:31:20,465 --> 01:31:23,416
他略显笨拙 但舌功相当好
A bit clumsy, but good with his tongue.

617
01:31:23,593 --> 01:31:27,409
他不仅吻我的嘴 还亲脖子 乳头
Not just in my mouth, but on my neck, on my tits,

618
01:31:27,597 --> 01:31:29,922
亲我的屁股中间和阴户
between my ass cheeks and in my pussy.

619
01:31:36,741 --> 01:31:40,109
婚后六个月 我又勾搭上个陌生人
Married six months and I'm taking it up the ass from a stranger.

620
01:31:40,287 --> 01:31:42,893
假如我不回米兰 他们会怎么说我？
What would they say if I don't go back to Milan?

621
01:31:43,112 --> 01:31:46,022
假如我和这样一个画裸体女人的男人私奔到巴黎？
If I run off to Paris with a man who draws nude women?

622
01:31:46,209 --> 01:31:49,014
你晓得他那一天到晚提醒着 “先生 记住你和这个那个有约”
You know that four-eyed slut who works as his secretary.

623
01:31:49,202 --> 01:31:51,704
的四眼婊子秘书
"Remember the appointment with so and so, sir."

624
01:31:52,121 --> 01:31:54,196
还有那些想出书的骚货
Whores who want to be published,

625
01:31:54,384 --> 01:31:57,606
巴不得爬到桌下帮他吹箫 就像此处这些女人
eager to suck him off under the desk, like these women here

626
01:31:57,794 --> 01:32:02,204
谁都在假装震惊 可是谁不想占据我的位置
who pretend to be shocked but who would all like to be in my place.

627
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,961
达里奥会不在意我
Dario would treat me like an accessory.

628
01:32:11,224 --> 01:32:14,488
可是如果他现在见到我 或许会改变主意
If he could see me now, maybe he'd change his mind.

629
01:32:14,665 --> 01:32:16,396
他的鸡巴就会硬起来
He'd get a hard-on

630
01:32:16,583 --> 01:32:20,473
因为他知道我的蜜穴里有根鸡巴 屁股上有只手
knowing I have a cock in my pussy and a hand on my ass.

631
01:32:23,747 --> 01:32:27,188
西维娅说得没错 嫉妒真是剂生猛的春药
Silvia's right, jealousy is an aphrodisiac.

632
01:32:30,180 --> 01:32:33,444
莱昂是个聪明的美男子
Leon must be as intelligent as he is hung,

633
01:32:35,540 --> 01:32:38,313
但我们的关系又能维持多久？
but how long could our relationship last?

634
01:32:38,501 --> 01:32:42,568
十厘升吧 鸡巴平均能喷射到你体内的量
Ten centilitres, the average amount a cock can spurt on you.

635
01:32:43,402 --> 01:32:45,873
那就是爱所能遗下的仅有一切
That's all that's left of love.

636
01:32:46,739 --> 01:32:49,064
文学节结束了
The festival has ended,

637
01:32:49,523 --> 01:32:51,994
宴会也结束了
the party's over too.

638
01:33:56,777 --> 01:33:58,957
你是在找这个吧？
Is this what you're looking for?

639
01:34:01,793 --> 01:34:04,775
我问你问题呢 回答我！
I asked you a question, answer me!

640
01:34:06,276 --> 01:34:10,343
-我在找我的睡衣  -忽悠精 你知道睡衣就在这儿
- I was looking for my nightgown.  - Liar, you know it's here.

641
01:34:10,833 --> 01:34:13,263
-还真在这儿呢  -知道现在几点了吗？
- Oh, of course it is.  - Know what time it is?

642
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:15,421
不知道 大概两点吧？
No. Around two?

643
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:19,237
现在是凌晨五点 你他妈的去哪儿了？
It's five in the morning. Where the fuck where you?

644
01:34:19,571 --> 01:34:22,522
我去哪儿？我陪西维娅出去跳舞了
Where was I? Out dancing with Silvia.

645
01:34:22,699 --> 01:34:24,847
西维娅在宴会上 你怎么谎话不断？
Silvia was at the party, why do you keep on lying?

646
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:29,925
要是你读过 自然就会明白原因！
If you read it, you know why!

647
01:34:33,449 --> 01:34:35,180
我当然看过
Sure, I read it.

648
01:34:38,110 --> 01:34:40,164
还真是本纪实杰作啊！
It's a real masterpiece!

It should be published and launched at the next festival.

650
01:34:45,274 --> 01:34:47,422
里面真是事无巨细滴水不漏
You don't leave anything out.

651
01:34:48,725 --> 01:34:52,646
在你那虚伪的端庄外表下 你却是最放荡的婊子！
Behind that fake veneer of modesty you're the biggest whore of all!

652
01:35:02,218 --> 01:35:04,439
让我来肏你 婊子 你是不是就想要这个？
Let me fuck you, bitch. Is this what you want?

653
01:35:15,481 --> 01:35:17,181
不…
No...

654
01:35:17,181 --> 01:35:19,652
不…达里奥…不要！

大声尖叫 我的爱！

那是你承诺给我的结婚礼物！
It's the wedding present you promised me!

662

西尔维亚是对的 多亏了莱昂 我又重新找回了达里奥
Silvia was right, thanks to Leon I found Dario again.

663
01:35:50,266 --> 01:35:53,331
看过我的日记后 他甚至行为都有点像莱昂
After reading my diary he even behaved like him.

664

嫉妒真的重新点燃了他的激情？
Did jealousy really rekindle his passion?

665
01:35:57,367 --> 01:36:00,735
那点一直纠缠他的疑心 让他大展雄风
Always having that little suspicion, that's what turns him on.

666
01:36:01,611 --> 01:36:04,561
当他疲倦而又满足之后 入睡前
Before he fell asleep, worn out and satisfied,

667
01:36:04,739 --> 01:36:07,835
他把手放在我的屁股上低声地明知故问：
he put his hand on my ass and whispered knowingly:

668
01:36:08,013 --> 01:36:10,891
你何时再去跟西尔维亚跳舞？
"When are you going dancing with Silvia again?"

669
01:34:45,274 --> 01:34:47,422
哇 多漂亮的车啊

你要去巴黎 是吗？
You'll going to Paris, isn't it?

671

正好搭顺风车 弗朗索瓦 你回酒店收拾好行李 顺便买单
Just get a ride, François, go to the hotel, bags-packing and paying.
