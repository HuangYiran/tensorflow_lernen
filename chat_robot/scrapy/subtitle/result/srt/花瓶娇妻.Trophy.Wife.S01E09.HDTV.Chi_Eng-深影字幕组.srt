我想我病了
I think I'm sick.

00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:14,350
你一晚上都睡这儿?
Did you sleep in here all night?

4
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:15,690
我不想传染给你
I didn't want to get you sick.

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,550
还有就是 我得离厕所近点儿
Plus, I needed to be near a toilet.

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,850
我们结婚了呢
And now we're married.

你哪儿都别去
You're not going anywhere.

11
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,180
你能把一整个班的二年级生都传染了
You could wipe out an entire class of sophomores.

12
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:30,770
管什么二年级生呢
Nobody cares about sophomores.

13
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:32,540
不 回你那充满病菌的浴缸里躺着 行吗
No, get back in your germ tub, all right?

14
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:33,570
你好好待着
You're staying here.

- 你在笑吗 - 什么

19
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,240
- 你刚刚是笑了吗 - 好吧 一下下啦
- Did you just smile? - Well, maybe a little.

20
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,270
我 我已经盘算着怎么才能不去好几个礼拜了
I I-- I've been wanting to get out of it for weeks.

21
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,800
就是不知道怎么办 直到
I just didn't know how until to--

22
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,060
你干什么呀 打电话找医生吗
What are you doing? Are you calling a doctor?

23
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,820

26
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,400
你能来看看他嘛
Could you come by and check on him?

27
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,930
不要啊 我错了
No. I'm sorry I smiled.

28
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,330
我不该笑 我收回 拜托
I take the smile back. Come on.

29
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:08,590
你当然可以用我们的榨汁机榨树叶汁
Oh, of course you can put leaves in our juicer.

30
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:09,960

花瓶娇妻 第一季第09集

34
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,790
要去参加活动了 你激动吗
You excited about the field trip?

35
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,450
当然啦 考察都是装装样子的
Yeah, it's fake school.

36
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:36,280
我可存了所有的零用钱准备去礼品店呢
And I saved up all my allowance for the gift shop.

37
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:37,660
你想在礼品店买什么
What do you want to buy at the gift shop?

38
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,460
我也不知道 凯特
Aw, gee, I don't know, Kate.

39
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,750
买个让你听起来像青蛙的哨子怎么样
Oh, how about a whistle that makes you sound like a frog?

40
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,220
你兴奋吗
Are you excited?

41
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:48,120
是啊 我要对着孩子们大吼大叫 跟你妈共处一室
Yeah, I get to yell at kids and hang out with your mom...

42
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,030
整整八个小时 还是在博物馆里
For eight hours... in a museum.

43
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:54,000
你在担心她会让你觉得自己很没文化 对吧
You're worried about her making you feel stupid, aren't you?

44
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,030
好吧 谢了 沃伦
Oh. Well, thanks, Warren.

45
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,270
我还没这么想过呢
I hadn't thought of that angle.

46
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,940
有时候我只想她对我和善一点
Sometimes I just wish she were a little nicer to me.

47
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:03,170
- 她可能需要来点儿吧 - 沃伦
- Maybe she needs to get some. - Warren!

48
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,800
这想法太赞了
That's a great idea.

49
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,870
但你不应该说那个
But you shouldn't be saying that.

50
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,090
听着 凯特我们都是成年人了
Oh, look, Kate, we're both adults here,

51
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,430
我觉得这完全是常识嘛
And I think it's common knowledge

52
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,700
来点儿 更轻松
that when people get some, they relax.

53
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,310
是啊 我知道
Yeah. I know.

54
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,530
只是听到你谈论你老妈的性生活 我震惊了
I'm just surprised to hear you talk about your mom having sex.

55
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,510
"来点儿"是这意思?
That's what "Get some" Means?

56
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,360
那你觉得是什么意思
What'd you think it meant?

57
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,780
我不知道啊 来点儿薯条 来条毯子
I don't know -- get some chips, a blanket,

58
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,850
只要是让你开心的东西都行
whatever makes you happy.

59
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,290
就是 "来点儿" 后面的词随便填 
You know, "Get some..." Fill in the blank.

60
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:32,260
沃伦 那就是性生活的意思 没事儿
Warren, it means "Sex," And that's okay.

61
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,730
你知道的 一个人性生活规律了
You know, when -- when people are getting it on the regular,

62
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:35,730
就会冷静下来
they chill out.

63
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,020
坦白的说 你的想法很好
And frankly, your idea's a good one.

64
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,880
- 你妈需要来点儿 - 性生活
- Your mom needs to get some... - sex.

65
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,380
是的
Exactly.

66
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,320
她需要来点儿性生活
She needs to get some sex...

67
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,270
好了
All right.

68
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,920
和老爸以外的男人
...with another man.

69
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,080
嘿 有什么事儿吗 伯特
Hey, everything okay, Bertie?

70
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,760
你会模仿老爸的签名吗
Can you sign dad's signature?

71
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,660
这个得看情况
Now, that depends.

72
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,640
是考察活动还是因为你干坏事儿了
Is it for a field trip or because you're in trouble?

73
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,390
- 坏事儿 - 那不行
- Trouble. - Then no.

74
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,760
那就是考察活动好了
Then field trip.

75
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,130
好吧 你干什么了
Okay, what did you do?

76
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,470
"伯特连续两天都不能有课间休息
"Bert has had to sit out of recess two days in a row

77
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,830
因为他经常用一些愚蠢的行为打断课堂"
For interrupting class with excessive silliness."

78
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,480
你都干什么了
What were you doing?

79
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:14,550
没什么啊
Nothing.

80
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,220
就是安静的看书
Just reading quietly,

81
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,160
偶尔跳个小舞 做几个伯特翻
sometimes a little dancing, a few bertwheels.

82
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:19,940
伯特翻?
Bertwheels?

83
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,360
就和侧手翻差不多 但一边翻一边叫
They're like cartwheels but with screaming.

84
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,330
你老师是维切山姆女士 对吧
Ms. Wickersham's your teacher, right?

85
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,470
- 是的 - 她以前是我老师
- Yeah. - She was my teacher.

86
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:28,150
很喜欢我
She adores me.

87
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,280
你老姐我要来救你了
Your big sister's gonna hook you up.

88
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,420
你这是干什么
What are you doing?

89
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,690
伯特翻
Bertwheels!

90
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,830
看看是谁萎靡不振的样子呀
Whoa. Look who hit the wall real hard.

91
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,730
幸好我下了猛料
Wow, I'm glad I sold high.

92
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:46,920
好 太完美了
Okay. Perfect.

93
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,380
我不要喝那个
I am not drinking that.

94
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:49,630
好吧
Okay.

95
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,710
事情是这样的 
So, here's the deal. Cool?

96
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,710
不管从哪个洞
This is gonna go in you,

97
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,120
我都会把这东西灌进去
one hole or another.

98
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,260
我还是用嘴喝吧
I choose mouth.

99
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,610
我喝下去你就走吗
If I drink this, you'll leave?

100
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:00,880
是的
Uh, yeah. Mm.

101
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,010
喝 喝 喝
More. More. More.

102
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,620
慢走不送
Bye-bye.

103
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:11,490
我得留下来 一小时后检查瞳孔
I have to stay and check your pupils in an hour --

104
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,800
确保我用对了蘑菇
Make sure I used the right kind of mushroom.

105
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,090
- 用对了蘑菇? - 是啊
- Right kind of mushroom? - Yeah.

106
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,040
给我
Give me that.

107
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,600
不要说话 好吗
No talking. Okay?

108
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,930
因为你需要休息
'cause you need to rest.

109
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:31,210
他们穿越了路桥 到这儿定居
They crossed the land bridge, and they came and settled here.

110
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,250
你们有五分钟时间去看看
So you've got five minutes to go look

111
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,170
蒙古建筑物 好吗
at the Mongolian structure, okay?

112
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,130
- 嗨 黛安 那么 - 凯特很好
- Hi, Diane. So -- - Kate, good.

113
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,280
我的想法是这样的
This is what I need --

114
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,610
A小队的孩子们现在应该要从鸟类展馆出来了
"A" kids should be coming out of the hall of birds right now.

115
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,670
然后我们让其中一半去鲸类馆
Then we'll send half of them up to the whales

116
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:45,400
另一半去亚洲织锦馆 好吗
and the other half down to the Asian tapestries, okay?

117
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,720
- 好的 - 很好
- Okay. - Good.

118
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,150
那么 周末如何呀
So, how was your weekend?

119
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,490
无论如何 我刚去过洗手间
Anyway, I just went to the bathroom,

120
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,930
现在你去的话刚刚好
so now's a good time for you to go.

121
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:53,670
然后就召集B队的学生 检查作业纸
Then we will round up group "B," check the work sheets,

122
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:54,790
确保没人作弊
Make sure they're not cheating,

123
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,640
然后我会偷听C组的情况
And I will eavesdrop on group "C."

124
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,120
偷听
Eavesdrop?

125
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,040
是的 凯特百分之九十的监护在于预防
Yes, Kate, 90% of chaperoning is prevention.

126
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:06,960
雅各布想要猥亵 一只恐龙
Jacob wanted to feel up...a dinosaur.

127
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:08,670
我偷听就是为了预防这个
My eavesdropping prevented that,

128
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:11,250
现在他要坐早班巴士回家了
And now he is going home on the early bus.

129
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,590
- 说到猥亵 - 嘘
- Speaking of feeling up -- - Shh.

130
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,150
青少年 偷听
Teenagers. Eavesdropping.

131
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,380
嘿 黛安
Oh, hey, Diane.

132
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,870
看到那对情侣没
Look at those two lovebirds, huh?

133
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:25,660
就算是几百年 几千年前

就是你生病的源泉吗
is the reason that you're sick to begin with?

168
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:53,130
也许是因为我的秘书在我眼睛里打喷嚏呢
Or maybe it's because my secretary sneezed in my eye.

169

You know what you need?

178
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:15,880
你需要待在包的紧紧的襁褓中
You need a nice tight swaddle.

179
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,060
不 求你了 别把我包起来

May I join you?

212

我认为监护人分开坐
I think it's more efficient

213
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,850
更方便 你不觉得吗
If the chaperones spread out, don't you?

Ohh, Kate. Is all the world a sex club to you?

245
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,110
要拉皮条也是给别人
Go pimp someone else, please.

246
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,090

It was, but I put an assload of codeine in your tea.

253
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,420
真搞笑 我得走了

- What's a suck-up? - Your sister.

271
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,930
我不该这么说的
I shouldn't have said that.

272
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:55,300
这场对话没有发生过
This conversation never happened.

273
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,880
什么对话
What conversation?

274
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:02,170
啥 她真的这么说了
What? She actually said that?

275
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:05,710
对 不过这场对话从没发生过
Yeah, but this conversation never happened.

276
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,220
她说我拍马屁
She called me a suck-up?

277
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:16,330
你要干嘛
Where are you going?

278
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:20,600
我要去对维切山姆小姐臭骂一顿
I am going to give Ms. Wickersham a piece of my mind...

279
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,360
把这个苹果带给她
And bring her this apple.

280
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,800
黛安 你好
Hey, Diane.

281
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,130
我和沃伦要在附近散会儿步
Uh, me and Warren were gonna go roam around.

282
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,560
你也应该来的
You should come with.

283
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,830
然后放弃我即将获得去兰花厅的位置
And give up my place in line for the orchid pavilion?

284
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,410
多谢你喜感的消遣 凯特
Thanks for the comedy entertainment, Kate.

285
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:38,670
兰花厅
The orchid pavilion?

286
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:41,820
那可是博物馆的中心展品
Oh, it is the centerpiece of this museum,

287
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,510
每次只让少数人进去
And they only let in a few people at a time

288
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,690
以便最大限度地享受宁静之美
to maximize the tranquil beauty.

289
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,340
那好 去吧
Okay.Go.

290
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,260
站到队后去 继续
Back of the line. Go ahead.

291
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:54,270
沃伦 我们得让你妈妈还有鲁斯 布拉德利 莫里森
Warren, we have got to get your mom and Russ Bradley Morrison

292
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,680
一起去兰花亭
into the orchid pavilion together.

293
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,220
- 你在唱... 唱的是啥啊 - 没啥
- What are we -- what are we singing? - Never mind.

294
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,420
只是...我们的人呢
Just -- where's our man?

295
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,850
就在那边
Oh, right there.

296
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:05,260
不要吧 他们从来不会一同进去
Oh, no. They'll never get in at the same time.

297
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,460
那我在你前边
Oh, uh, I'm way ahead of you.

298
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,620
瞧我怎么让谣言四起的
Watch me crank up the rumor mill.

299
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,870
伙计们
Hey, guys. Guys.

300
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,710
在更新世岩厅要有一场打斗演出
There's gonna be a fight in the Pleistocene room.

301
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,060
相互转告 伙计们
Pass it on. Hey, guys.

302
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,510
在更新世岩厅要有一场打斗演出
There's gonna be a fight in the Pleistocene room.

303
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,700
更新世岩厅 走吧 快来
Pleistocene room. Let's go. Come on.

304
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,520
走吧 打打打
Let's go. Fight. Fight. Fight.

305
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,410
搞定
Get on it.

306
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:20,950
谢谢你
Thank you.

307
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,780
- 谢谢 - 尽情享受展览吧
- Thank you. - Enjoy the exhibit.

308
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,030
救命
Help.

309
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,110
有男人
A man.

310
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:01,690
你怎么下床了
How are you out of bed?

311
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,670
茶里的可待因都够让一头熊晕过去了
There was enough codeine in that tea to knock a bear out.

312
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,420
这些人是谁 他们在我家做什么
Who are these people? What are they doing in my house?

313
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,680
他们不是人
There's no people.

314
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,230
只是幻觉
That's a hallucination.

315
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,940
所以回去睡觉
So, go back to sleep.

316
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,000
- 睡觉 - 睡...
- Sleep. - Sl--

317
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,720
我命令你 睡觉
I command it. Sleep.

318
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,190
就是这样 鲁斯 布拉德利 莫里森.
That's right, Russ Bradley Morrison.

319
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,340
你知道你喜欢亲眼所见的
You know you like what you see.

320
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:35,040
中世纪的时候 兰花被看成春药
In the middle ages, orchids were considered an aphrodisiac,

321
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:37,350
但真正吸引我来到这里的
but the only thing turning me on in this room

322
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,980
是你裤套装的曲线
are the curves of your pantsuit.

323
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,480
像在印度遗产文化博物馆里那样吻我吧
Kiss me like you did at the Indian Heritage Museum.

324
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,570
在安哥拉洛奇后面
Behind the Potawatomi Lodge?

325
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,590
老天
Oh, my god!

326
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,330
怎...出什么事了
Wh-- what's going on?

327
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:56,970
你认识他
You know him.

328
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,580
不不 我不认识
Uh, no. No. I don't.

329
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,610
又来了 难以相信
Here we go again. Unbelievable.

330
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:03,080
她确实认识我 她非常了解我
She does know me. She knows me very well.

331
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,470
她一直是我的...
She's been to my condo...

332
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,810
因为我们互相见了两年了
Because we've been seeing each other for two years.

333
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,950
我可不是博物馆随便约炮的人
I am not a cheap museum booty call.

334
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:13,740
我是个男人 黛安
I'm a man, Diane.

335
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,080
鲁斯 布拉德利
Russ Bradley.

336
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:17,980
过去了
It's over.

337
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,190
很抱歉
Oh, I'm sorry.

338
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:21,270
我们每十分钟才开一次这扇门
We only open this door every 10 minutes

339
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,730
为了给兰花提供适当的湿度
to provide the proper, uh, humidity for the orchids.

340
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,050
所以你们还有六分钟
So you've got six minutes.

341
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:42,210
我不认识你
Well, I don't know about you,

342
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,700
不过我今天确实学到了很多兰花的知识
but I sure learned a ton about orchids today.

343
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:47,720
你怎么敢在插在我私事中间
How dare you meddle in my personal affairs?

344
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,720
黛安  我只不过想帮忙
Diane, I was just trying to help.

345
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:51,350
我是说 我以为你跟他很融洽
I mean, I thought you'd get along with him,

346
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:54,390
显而易见你们确实是...长达两年
which apparently you did... for two years.

347
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:57,010
我意思是 我们就不能在此承认吗 我都逮到了
I mean, can we just acknowledge here -- I nailed it.

348
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:59,850
贸易学校不教圆滑处事吗
Do they not teach tact in trade school?

349
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:02,980
你刚刚毁了我的恋爱 凯特
You just destroyed my relationship, Kate.

350
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,180
你想的都是什么
What were you thinking?

351
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,380
- 黛安 我... - 不不不
- Diane, I...  - No, no, no, no, no.

352
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,410
我确实想知道
I really want to know.

353
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:11,250
我想理解 像我研究洞穴人那样
I want to understand and study you

354
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,480
来研究你
the way I would study a caveman.

355
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,790
说实话 我只是想
Well, to be totally honest, I just thought

356
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:20,890
如果你有...伙伴关系
that if you were getting some...companionship,

357
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,590
可能你对我会好一点
that maybe you would be nicer to me.

358
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:24,370
我懂了
I see.

359
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:27,460
要是发生关系 我会放松下来
If I got laid, I might relax.

360
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:29,390
话不是这么说的
Well, not in those words.

361
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,510
如果我定期和人亲热一下
We might be friends, even,

362
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:34,310
我们甚至可能成为朋友
if I just got a little roll in the hay on a regular basis.

363
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:36,370
- 话绝对不是这么讲的 - 天呐
- Definitely not in those words. - Oh, god.

364
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,190
你为什么要搞地下情呢?
Why would you keep your relationship a secret?

365
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,500
我的意思是 你又不是要去参加竞选
I mean, it's not like you're running for office.

366
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,470
天呐 你要去竞选职位吗?
Oh, my god, are you running for office?

367
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,830
让我把某些事情跟你说清楚 凯特
Let me spell something out for you, Kate.

368
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:49,360
我做的每件事都很成功
I succeed at everything I do.

369
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:52,320
我失败过一次 我的婚姻
I had one failure -- my marriage.

370
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,410
我搞地下情
I kept this relationship private

371
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:58,580
是因为这是我的事
because it's my business.

372
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:02,180
我懂了
Ohh, I get it.

373
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:05,800
所以如果这段恋爱不顺利
And maybe if it didn't work out,

374
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,520
没人会知道你失败了
no one would have to know that you failed.

375
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:12,270
当我想知道拿铁里要放多少牛奶时
When I want to know how much milk to put in a latte,

376
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,340
我会问你的
I'll ask you,

377
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,860
所以直到那时 亲爱的 请别给我忠告
And until then, dear, no advice, please.

378
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,150
我从来没做过咖啡师
I was never a barista.

379
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:20,560
从未做过咖啡师
Never a barista.

380
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,840
我甚至不喜欢咖啡
Don't even like coffee.

381
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,160
该死的目标小组是什么东西?
What the hell is a goals group?

382
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:26,790
目标
G.O.A.L.S.

383
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:29,890
"以目标为导向的成熟女企业家"
"Goal-oriented adult lady entrepreneurs-s-s"

384
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:30,700
简称目标
G.O.A.L.S.

385
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,430
我们基本上是一个由未绝经的
We're basically a business support group

386
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:35,420
中年女人们所组成商业扶持小组
of women of a certain age who haven't yet gone through menopause.

387
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,340
看 我们通过鼓励和反复打气
See, we help each other achieve our goals

388
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:41,620
帮助彼此实现我们的目标
through encouragement and repetition and repetition.

389
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:44,520
- 你们谁有工作吗? - 我们有目标
- Do any of you people have jobs? - We have goals.

390
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,470
我的目标是完成我起头的事
My goal was to finish what I started.

391
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:48,690
所以 当我同意照顾你
So, when I agreed to take care of you

392
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,220
和护理你恢复健康
and nurse you back to health,

393
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,930
我清除了一切障碍
I didn't let anything get in my way.

394
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:53,360
你没有护理我恢复健康
You didn't nurse me back to health.

395
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:55,130
我的病比之前更严重了
I'm sicker than I was before.

396
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:57,400
你说得对 杰基他真的很悲观
Oh, you're right, Jackie. He's really negative.

397
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,060
没人... 没人让你发表意见
Uh, nobody... nobody asked you.

398
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,990
杰基你 你 你把我困在床上
Jackie, y-y-you trapped me in my bed.

399
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,950
你截断了我与外界的联系
You cut me off from the outside world.

400
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,340
你对我下药
You drugged me.

401
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,840
这 这像是"危情十日"的情节
Th-this is like the plot of "Misery."

402
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,380
你知道吗?
You know what?

403
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,550
我觉得你有点戏剧化了
I think you're being a little dramatic,

404
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,500
因为我所做的... 杰基所做的
because what I did... what Jackie did

405
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,030
是重新安排了她的整个日程表 好吗?
is rearranged her entire schedule, okay?

406
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:17,570
还有我想要一点点感谢语 目标
And I'd like a little bit of gratitude. Goals.

407
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,250
目标 目标 目标 目标 目标
Goals. Goals. Goals. Goals. Goals.

408
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,380
目标? 你们知道吗?
Goals? You know what?

409
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,610
你们... 你们知道我的目标是什么吗?
You... you want to know my goal?

410
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,930
我希望你们所有人十秒钟之内离开我的房子
I want all of you out of my house in 10 seconds,

411
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:31,060
不然 我就要打喷嚏 挠痒 咳嗽...
or I'm gonna sneeze, scratch, cough...

412
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,930
喘息 还有舔你们每一个人
wheeze, and lick every one of you.

413
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:39,670
我要把锁换了 把备层填满
I'm changing the locks, filling in the crawl space,

414
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:41,150
还要把狗洞用木板封住
and boarding up the dog door.

415
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,080
那些...
Well, that...

416
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,140
...没有帮助!
...won't help!

417
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,240
这谈话只需要一分钟 南希
This will only take a minute, Nancy.

418
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,550
刚开始 我对你说我是马屁精这事很生气
At first, I was offended that you called me a suck-up,

419
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,980
但一路骑车过来 我理解了有些事
but on the ride over here, I realized something.

420
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:58,860
你说我是马屁精 我觉得我是进取之人
What you call a "suck-up" I call a "go-getter."

421
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,110
所以我会继续做进取之人
So I am going to keep go-getting,

422
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,300
因为它会带领我去我想要去的地方
because it is going to go-get me places.

423
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,220
首先 它会带我进入大学
First, it's going to go-get me into college,

424
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:09,420
然后 它会带我进入法律学院
and then it's going to go-get me into law school,

425
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:12,160
最后 它会带我取得
and finally, it's going to go-get me a job

426
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,890
高等法院法官索尼娅 索托梅耶尔的书记员工作
clerking for Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor,

427
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,960
所以就去拍我的马屁吧
so suck up on that.

428
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,710
顺便说一下 这是给你的
By the way, this is for you.

429
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,170
这是有机苹果
It's organic.

430
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,390
你的妈妈生气了 这是我的错
So, your mom's mad, and it's kind of my fault.

431
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,740
我真心希望我能和她谈谈 但她根本不理我
And I really wish I could talk to her, but she won't listen.

432
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,120
她很记仇
That bites.

433
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,210
能给我点去买宇航员雪糕的钱吗?
Can I get some money for some astronaut ice cream?

434
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,080
过来
Come here.

435
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,390
为什么? 
Why?

436
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:44,610
沃伦 我知道你害怕的东西
Warren, I know what you're afraid of.

437
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:45,900
- 剪刀 - 失败
- Scissors. - Failure.

438
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,950
不要试图去做完美无缺的人
Don't let trying to be perfect

439
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:49,710
而是只要自己开心就好
get in the way of you being happy.

440
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,090
我的意思是 当然 你可以为了保全面子
I mean, sure, you can play it safe

441
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,100
而永远不敞开心扉
and never put yourself out there,

442
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:55,750
但所有的这些只是你在害怕而已 你知道吗?
but all that really is, is you just being afraid, you know?

443
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,640
我的生活中常常发生美好的事情
Everything great that's ever happened in my life

444
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,090
是因为我愿意去丢脸受挫
has been because I've been willing to fall on my face.

445
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,650
你说的对 你知道吗?
You're right. You know what?

446
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:05,320
从现在开始 我不会化太多精力去变得十全十美
From now on, I'm not gonna focus so much on being so perfect.

447
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,780
不客气 去玩吧
You're welcome. Go play.

448
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:10,950
打扰一下?
Excuse me?

449
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:13,760
今天 天文馆节目的标题是
And now today's planetarium show,

450
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,070
"数学 太间的组成部分"
entitled "Math: The Building Block of Space."

451
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,000
不好意思?
Excuse me?

452
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,930
在我们开始之前
Um, before we begin,

453
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:24,860
我想说件事
there is something I'd like to say.

454
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,500
你们看到那位男士了吗?
Do you see that man?

455
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,440
我认识那个人
I know that man.

456
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:36,020
我认识他 而且和他交流过
I know him and have talked to him.

457
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,170
还有...
And...

458
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,180
我很享受和他的谈话
I enjoy talking to him.

459
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:46,030
在未来的某时
And I hope to talk to him again

460
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,630
我希望还能再次与他交谈
sometime in the future.

461
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:48,570
谢谢大家
Thank you.

462
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,880
说的真好 你做的不错
That was beautiful. You did great.

463
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,770
什么意思?
What?

464
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,760
谢谢你的帮助... 沃伦
Thank you for your help... Warren.

465
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,420
我要你
I want you.

466
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,630
来吧
Take me.

467
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,810
笑什么?
What?

468
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,040
据官方消息
It's official.

469
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,130
火星上无生命迹象
There's no life on Mars.

470
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,720
他们何时才能明白?
When will they ever learn?

471
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,890
几年前我就能告诉他们这事儿了
I could have told them that years ago.
