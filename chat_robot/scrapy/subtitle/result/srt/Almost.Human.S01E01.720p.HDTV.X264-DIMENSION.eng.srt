00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,210
It's an ambush!

11
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:01,000
John, damn it. I've been hit! I'm down!

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,830
Pelham! - On the west side!

13
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:09,200
Pelham's down. I need you to lead me in!
We don't know how many suspects are in there.

14
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,900
- Risking one life to save one life... - Shut up!

15
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,730
Lead me in! Move!

16
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,270
Hey, buddy. So this ain't good.

17
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,550
No, it's not. Could always be worse!

18
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:44,010
It just got worse. They were ready for us, John.

19
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:48,100
How did Insyndicate know we were coming? How did they know?

20
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,020
MX! - How'd they know?

21
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,310
We're getting out of here. Give me a diagnostic!

22
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,650
Blood pressure's dropping, celiac artery's blown apart.

23
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:00,910
There's nothing to do, sir. We're getting out of here.

24
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:03,380
He will bleed to death - before you get him out of here. - Shut up!

25
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,620
- Cover us! We're leaving! - I cannot do that.

26
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:09,470
Others have a better statistical chance of surviving. I need to protect them.

27
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:12,430
Are you staying with your partner? You're damn right I am!

28
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,630
 Come back here!

29
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:17,230
Come on.

33
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,780
Tell me what you remember. This time...

34
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,640
I remember the radio call. From Pelham.

35
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:57,040
Your partner.

36
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,970
Yeah. - But not much more than that.

37
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,200
I still can't remember every detail.

38
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,180
I want to go again. You made good progress tonight, John.

39
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,780
You were in a coma for 17 months, yes?

40
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,520
Technically, we shouldn't be doing this procedure

41
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,010
until you've been fully conscious for one year.

42
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,640
Yeah. Well, technically...

43
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,290
you're an unlicensed doctor from SubAsia

44
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,350
practicing black market medicine.

45
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,230
Well, yes, you can throw me in prison if you want,

46
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:30,320
but... I accepted you as a patient out of kindness.

47
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,820
You seemed like a desperate man when I met you.

48
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,900
And now? Now... you seem like a desperate man.

49
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:41,040
John, I know you said the people who ambushed you disappeared,

50
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,590
but, despite my best efforts, you may not remember who they are.

51
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,780
Most people come to a Recollectionist...

52
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,820
they want to remember good things.

53
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,980
Why can't you let this go?
It's been two years.

54
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,920
You know...

55
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,800
they killed my team...

56
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,990
my friends.

57
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:06,720
And without this treatment, I can't remember anything.

58
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,720
I remembered something else this time.

59
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,120
My ex-girlfriend. Anna.

60
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,040
We were in my apartment.

61
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,870
Strange. I'll, uh...

62
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:29,220
refine the triggering of that cluster next time.

63
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,650
Your nose is bleeding.

64
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:20,370
Detective. You all right?

65
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:22,670
Yeah.

66
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:26,220
Where's your MX? I'm off duty.

67
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,850
- Where's your human? - Talking to a witness.

68
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:31,850
Individuals came over the wall an hour ago.

69
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:38,190
Drive safely. Yeah, I will.

70
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,280
Message saved for 738 days.

71
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,590
Hi, honey.

72
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:36,030
So, I know you're probably still asleep, but,

73
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:38,150
John, the sun is setting

74
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:41,560
and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

75
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,610
Look.

76
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,870
Your father would've loved this place.

77
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,230
Oh, I can't wait to get back to you.

78
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:53,060
I know I have to wait a week, but...

79
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:57,270
what I really wish is that you were here with me.

80
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,740
Morning. - Morning.

81
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,780
- You coming in? - I know I said I was ready.

82
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:23,150
Just give me one more day. No. I already gave you one more day.

83
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:25,910
And another and another. It's time, John.

84
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:28,610
John?

85
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,050
I just got a report of a coordinated armed robbery in South Kelvin.

86
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,720
Looks like it was Insyndicate.

87
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,870
Insyndicate?

88
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,980
Okay. I'll come in.

89
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:59,820
Synthetic calibration incomplete.

90
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,700
Synthetic calibration incomplete.

91
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,780
Synthetic calibration incompl...

92
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,310
I can't access the system. Are you in?

93
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:18,040
I'm in. - I'm not in. I'm out. All my files are locked.

94
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,440
Sounds like Martinez is messing with you again.

95
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,080
We're supposed to be in a truce, so, if that's true, I'm gonna kill him.

96
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:26,850
Well, there is one other possibility.

97
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:29,880
Did you forget your password again, Detective Vogel?

98
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,920
Not bad for a guy who's been asleep for two years.

99
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:41,420
I wouldn't say that. He looks weak, to me.

100
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,950
Richard,

101
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:45,610
I know this won't be easy for you: don't be a prick.

102
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:48,810
This department's handled affairs just fine without him. What's your problem with Kennex?

103
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,690
Don't ask to hear the story... you'll die of boredom.

104
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,790
And exposure to severe envy. Look, there's nothing to envy in him.

105
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:58,530
Kennex oversaw that raid, controlled all the intel and got his team ambushed.

106
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:02,100
Everyone, except the one man responsible... Kennex... was killed.

107
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,760
Should've been discharged. Richard.

108
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:08,520
He won't last. You just watch.

109
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:25,110
Kennex, John. Registration complete. Thanks.

110
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:30,500
Detective Kennex, I'm 785. I've been assigned to you.

111
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,850
I'm aware this is your first day back.

112
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:38,040
I only want to make your acclimation to active duty as smooth as possible for you.

113
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,600
I'm here to attend to all your n...

114
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,810
I'm not driving with one of those things.

115
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:44,090
Human partner was good enough for my father.

116
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,550
It's good enough for me.

117
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:48,410
Since you were last here, MX partners have become mandatory.

118
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,650
I'm not gonna fight you on some kind of regulation thing, okay?

119
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,810
I'm not doing it. - Like hell you're not.

120
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:54,610
Have you read Tilden's profile of you?

121
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:57,020
And, by the way, he is a very capable psychiatrist.

122
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,080
"Kennex should return to service never. "

123
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,050
- Never? Wow, that's... that's a long time. - "Kennex is suffering

124
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:03,690
"From depression, mental atrophy,

125
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:09,100
"Trauma onset OCD, PTSD and psychological rejection of his synthetic body parts. "

126
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,800
Well, that last part is true.

127
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:18,670
Listen, you're the only person more desperate than I am to find out how Insyndicate learned about the raid.

128
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,790
If we work together, we can do it.

129
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,300
This happened a few hours ago.

130
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,340
Robbery target was an armored truck, carrying bio research.

131
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:33,800
If this is an Insyndicate operation, it might help us learn more about them.

132
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,820
What's the connection? Parabolic pulse charge was used to stop the vehicle.

133
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,920
I haven't seen that since the ambush.

134
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,670
Well, sure looks like Insyndicate.

135
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,840
Inventory report? - That's not in yet.

136
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,320
Whatever they wanted, they killed four security guards to get it.

137
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:55,520
One of the thieves was shot. He's being treated at County.

138
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,250
John?

139
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:01,130
Keep the Insyndicate connection between us, okay?

140
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,430
You think someone in the department's working with them?

141
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,600
You're the only guy I trust here.

142
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,430
Okay. I'll check it out.

143
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:18,170
One more thing. Go easy on your partner.

144
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,220
Come.

145
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:40,000
Truck belongs to a private lab run by Omni, company specializing in DNA research.

146
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:45,640
According to the manager, they were transporting vials of single-strand synthetic, programmable DNA.

147
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,740
Detective? Valerie Stahl.

148
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,750
John Kennex.

149
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,570
Pleasure to meet you. - You, too.

150
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,390
Okay.

151
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:55,910
So tell me what you got on programmable DNA.

152
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:59,600
Programmable DNA can be used to trigger the process of tissue creation.

153
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,540
For example, to grow sets of organs in humans, possibly for harvest.

154
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,830
What else was taken?

155
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:07,910
Acid, bencarmidium, thianel, Myklon Red.

156
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,000
Myklon Red.

157
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:17,020
Myklon Red, Myklon Red...

158
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,040
Detective?

159
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,240
Detective, you okay?

160
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,180
Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks.

161
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:37,830
This sector is Khmer Black territory. They've been known to traffic in biotech in the past.

162
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:40,090
We're rounding up the usual suspects.

163
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:41,840
You don't buy it?

164
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,110
Ruby Mah assumed leadership of the gang six months ago when his brother was killed.

165
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,630
It was controversial. He's seen as too Western.

166
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,810
He needs to show the people he's traditional.

167
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,890
Today is the last day of the Cambodian New Year,

168
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:55,610
Loeung Sakk, a day of repentance for wrongdoing.

169
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:58,900
He wouldn't commit violence today. This was another gang.

170
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:04,420
I find behavioral tendencies in data and identify criminal patterns.

171
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:08,140
Or didn't intelligence analysts do that before I got here?

172
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:11,700
Thanks. I, uh... I really appreciate it.

173
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,350
Excuse me. Sure.

174
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,180
Tell command we're 10-19. What happened back there?

175
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,710
What are you talking about?

176
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:39,210
It seemed like a petit mal seizure. I will need to report what I saw.

177
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:40,870
I'm fine. You're not gonna report anything.

178
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,890
You were in Koln Avenue District last night.

179
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:45,940
An MX saw you there. I am concerned, Detective.

180
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:49,030
That area is populated by numerous black market medical clinics.

181
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:51,290
And some tasty noodle joints.

182
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:58,050
Look, I appreciate your concern, but there's nothing to report.

183
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,840
Another curious thing, Detective Kennex?

184
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,960
Last night, there were no comestible trace particles on your breath,

185
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,730
indicating you were not there for noodles. I think we should...

186
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,270
 Hey, Rudy.

187
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:44,070
 As I live and breathe.

188
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,770
Or should I say, as you live and breathe? How are ya?

189
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:50,690
Constantly turning down party invitations.

190
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:54,390
I've become quite popular with the ladies. How can I help?

191
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:59,120
I got a rec order for another synthetic.

192
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,200
He fell?

193
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:04,470
Out of a moving car?
Yeah, crazy, huh?

194
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:08,630
Must be some kind of software issue. Gonna need a new one.

195
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,640
Software?

196
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,250
Since we don't have any MXs available,

197
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:20,610
department's only cleared one model for active duty. Funny, actually. This, uh...

198
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:25,160
this unit was scheduled to be transferred to NASA next month.

199
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,480
It's sad really. He's scrap metal.

200
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,090
The trimidium circuits in his spinal column are
worth more than the whole of him.

201
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,330
Wait a minute. That's... that's one of the crazy ones.

202
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:42,790
What? No. That's rude. Not crazy, per se.

203
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:43,690
You know, they had their...

204
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:47,120
What? Problems? Who doesn't have problems?

205
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:52,150
Technically, they're perfectly functional. Look at him.

206
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,850
He's road-worthy.

207
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:58,240
John, Dorian. Dorian, John.

208
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:07,150
There. Should be functional. His DF was bad.

209
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,180
Anything I need to know?

210
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,590
Well, the DRN series...

211
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:13,730
they were based on a program called Synthetic Soul.

212
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:18,000
And while he isn't crazy, as you say, there may be some bugs.

213
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,470
Bugs? What kind of bugs?

214
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:23,510
Some of them had difficulty dealing with their emotive regulations.

215
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:27,530
Emotional issues. The idea behind the DRNs was to be as human as possible.

216
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:31,570
And the truth is that it's human to have unexpected emotional responses.

217
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:35,840
And if, uh, being as close to human was the goal, then,

218
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,050
I guess the DRNs weren't such a failure after all.

219
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:43,160
People have breaking points, and... so do DRNs.

220
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,730
So you're saying he's a basket case. Not words I would use, or agree with.

221
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,800
All right, plug it in already.

222
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,650
I got to get back on the street. - Okay.

223
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:59,700
Please have the honor of waking him up yourself.

224
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,350
Touch it against his left ear.

225
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,730
How long was I out?

226
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,480
Uh, four years and three months.

227
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,630
Detective John Kennex.

228
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,970
I'm Dorian. How are you?

229
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:43,060
Your record is outstanding.

230
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,410
Used to be. Excuse me?

231
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:47,600
Update your files. Let's go.

232
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:54,990
Hey, boss.

233
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:02,030
He's on the move. Let's go!

234
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,480
You heard him. Let's go.

235
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,810
So what do I call you? Detective.

236
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,310
Well, Detective, this sure beats repairing thermal insulation tiles

237
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,040
on the C.N.A. Space Station.

238
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:42,000
I was decommissioned four years ago, as you know.

239
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,270
Why am I in this car with you?

240
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:47,600
I'm required to ride with a synthetic.

241
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,530
I'm not a huge fan of that term.

242
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,890
St. Christopher.

243
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:58,930
This has to be a gift from someone. Am I right?

244
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:01,500
Something like 80% of these are given as gifts.

245
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,210
Synthetics are precise.

246
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:06,160
There's that term again. You just said, "Something like 80%."

247
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:10,780
The actual statistic is 83.42%, but I'm running my colloquialism routine,

248
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:13,350
so I express most data conversationally, man.

249
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,610
Terrific.

250
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,910
So, who's "A"?

251
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:22,150
Addison? Annie? Adeline?

252
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:24,000
Alana? Anita?

253
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,290
Amy? Audrey? Aquamarine? Okay, that's enough, all right?

254
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:30,990
 synthetic off.

255
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:37,240
Synthetic off? Does that mean you want me to be quiet?

256
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,310
Yeah, whatever the mode is for you to be quiet, just do that.

257
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:43,000
Hey, man, I can be quiet.

258
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,040
You can just... ask.

259
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:51,280
Synthetic calibration incomplete.

260
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:55,200
Synthetic calibration incomplete.

261
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,780
Stand by. I'll be back.

262
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,660
Here you go, ma'am.

263
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:16,520
Yeah, give me a black coffee, no sugar.

264
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,180
You got it, Detective Vogel.

265
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:29,820
Officer Vogel, it's good to see you again. Who are you?

266
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,240
Haven't seen one of those synthetics for years.

267
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:01,690
It's perfect. Two cops from the scrap heap.

268
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:03,720
This is gonna be more pathetic than I thought.

269
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:07,090
Those are the models that replaced me.

270
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:14,420
Intimidating. Go register so we can get moving.

271
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,360
DRN registration complete. Hey, bot.

272
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,300
Don't snap on us, now.

273
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:41,150
Sir, Detective Vogel's been abducted. Maldonado wants you on it.

274
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:44,350
His MX was destroyed. This is all we could get off it.

275
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,400
Based on the masks,

276
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,620
these are the same guys from the armed robbery.

277
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:51,000
Suspect back from County?

278
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:56,050
Your gang kills four security guards.

279
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:59,360
Now you've taken a cop. Where is he?

280
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,390
Did they take him 'cause we have you?

281
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:12,230
You know what this is? It's your booking file.

282
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:15,090
It describes the condition you were in when we got you.

283
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,730
Now...

284
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:20,570
What are you doing with programmable DNA?

285
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,750
What's the Myklon Red for?

286
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:36,090
Oh, look, suspect has a scratch above his eye. I have no idea how he got that.

287
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:39,620
Better add it, and get ready to write down "missing molar".

288
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,520
There are other ways, Detective.

289
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:46,150
I'm questioning this man, okay, not you.

290
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:50,640
Now...

291
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,860
Synthetic fail. Calibration required.

292
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:56,920
Synthetic fail. Calibration required.

293
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,740
Synthetic fa...

294
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:05,100
You shot yourself.

295
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:10,130
Perhaps it was a bit crazy this morning, maybe the doctors at County even missed it,

296
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:13,640
but the trajectory of the bullet that hit you, the burn marks on your flesh...

297
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,540
basically there's no chance that you were hit by a bullet from any gun but your own.

298
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:22,960
Is that true?

299
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,340
You don't know the people I work for. Trust me, I do.

300
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,570
I needed to get away from them any way I could,

301
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:36,490
because there's no getting away from them.

302
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:39,440
Look, we can help you, we can keep you safe, but you need to give us information.

303
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,450
No, I'm not safe anywhere, not even here.

304
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:43,600
We'll put you in a secure location under guard.

305
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,100
No one will find you, but you need to talk.

306
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:49,930
I need to be somewhere safe. Then, where's Detective Vogel?

307
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:53,190
What's the address?

308
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:58,190
325 Grand, Apartment 6.

309
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:09,520
Not that you need me to tell you this, but you just violated the crap out of that guy's civil rights.

310
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,160
Fantastic, I get the synthetic with the bleeding heart.

311
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,800
Look, I don't care what you're programmed to do.

312
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,940
You report what happened in there and you'll find yourself bouncing down the 604.

313
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:21,850
Detective, if I'm going to report anything, it is because I decided it needed to be reported.

314
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,990
I feel sick.

315
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,570
I need a toilet.

316
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:00,550
You all right?

317
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,800
I'll be fine.

318
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:29,310
Stop. Potential explosive device.

319
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,440
Humans back.

320
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,970
Evacuate the building.

321
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:38,510
DRN, halt advancement, halt advancement.

322
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:51,920
Detective.

323
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,330
What is it? It's not a bomb.

324
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:05,300
That trip wire leads somewhere.

325
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,870
I'll lead you in? I do not advise that, sir.

326
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:13,970
Let's go.

327
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:37,810
Vogel.

328
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:41,150
Help! Stay calm.

329
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:43,800
Kennex, help me! Help!

330
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,500
Do something!

331
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,680
Bulletproof glass. It's welded shut.

332
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,260
Patel speaking. Patel, where are you?

333
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,780
En route to the safe house. We have the perp in the car.

334
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,670
Okay, turn around... this whole thing's a setup.

335
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:11,060
Patel, Patel.

336
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,590
No, no, no, no...

337
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,760
Sergeant Patel and two other officers were killed,

338
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,510
three MXs were destroyed, and the suspect escaped.

339
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:42,890
It's about time.

340
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,520
I'm sorry.

341
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,850
Morgue lab is too slow.

342
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:13,600
Get a lab box, take a sample of his blood, and send it to Rudy for analysis.

343
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,130
Don't need a lab box.

344
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:32,820
I just downloaded the information. Rudy should have the data now.

345
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,540
Why him? Why target Vogel?

346
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:48,040
Scan every case Vogel was on.

347
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,640
Any connection to biotech, science, medicine, DNA.

348
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,800
I want to see it.

349
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,680
I don't know if this is anything, but one of his files is missing.

350
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:04,420
Case file number 6663. It's gone from all internal records.

351
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:08,170
Wait a minute, Detective Vogel told me this morning that he couldn't get access to his terminal.

352
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:10,770
Maybe whoever took him was deleting the file.

353
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:15,370
They got into the whole system. Who is they?

354
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:18,400
See if anyone downstairs can get that file back. On my way.

355
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:24,190
The way you said that...

356
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:27,860
you're thinking someone specific is behind this. Who?

357
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,060
When I want your help, I'll ask for it.

358
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,320
You know what your problem is?

359
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:40,700
Always my favorite part of the day: a synthetic telling me what my problem is.

360
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:45,280
There's that word again. Your problem is, you don't know yourself.

361
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,040
You don't trust anyone. Is that my problem?

362
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,010
And, man, I don't blame you.

363
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:53,290
After all you've been through, if I were like you, I wouldn't know myself either.

364
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:57,010
Okay, firstly stop saying "Man. " Secondly you're not like me.

365
00:30:57,010 --> 00:31:00,750
And I'm not like them. MX units are logic-based and rule-oriented.

366
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:04,240
They have no true free will and they are designed to feel nothing.

367
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,140
Now, I can't say that I was born, I can't say I grew in a womb or had a childhood,

368
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:13,040
but I was made to feel and I do
as much as you.

369
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:17,250
I read what you wrote: that if an MX hadn't left you behind to save some others,

370
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,760
your partner might have made it out of that ambush alive,

371
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,890
and that part may be true, but I read the whole report.

372
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:27,680
By the time the ambush had begun, it was already too late and it was you who led them in,

373
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:31,910
so you can blame an MX or you can blame yourself.

374
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:33,800
- Okay, you know what? - I am nothing like an MX-43.

375
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,930
You're obviously malfunctioning right now.

376
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:36,670
Why don't you just take a second to reboot yourself? Do not talk to me that way.

377
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:38,890
If anyone is malfunctioning, it is you, Kennex. You know what I'm gonna stop doing?

378
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:41,710
I'm gonna stop arguing with a piece of silicon and carbon fiber.

379
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,430
Kennex. It's Rudy.

380
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:48,660
All police in the department are required to have mandatory inoculations

381
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:51,620
designed in police labs for officers only.

382
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,840
Those inoculations are meant to keep cops safe.

383
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,850
Protects against biowarfare, gases, pathogens, et cetera.

384
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:02,450
We found Myklon Red in Vogel's blood, combined with programmable DNA.

385
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:05,130
It targets the inoculation directly.

386
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:08,140
It's like getting a hundred different diseases at once.

387
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:10,940
The immune system goes berserk. What are you saying, Rudy?

388
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:15,420
That's why his body reacted in the way that it did. That's why he died.

389
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:18,820
I believe Detective Vogel was a test subject.

390
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:21,730
Whoever we're up against... They're targeting cops.

391
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:29,750
Where are you going?

392
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,300
I cannot allow you to do this. It's far too soon.

393
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,240
Look, this isn't about me, okay?

394
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,170
Someone is killing police officers, and the only way we're gonna find them

395
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:41,670
is if I remember more about the people who are doing it.

396
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:44,310
John, it's not safe for you.

397
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:46,580
You do this and you do it now.

398
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:05,800
They were ready for us, John. How did Insyndicate know we were coming?

399
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,650
How did they know? How'd they...?

400
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,120
Hey, come back here! You're damn rob...!

401
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,920
I am so sorry. I told him it was too dangerous.

402
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:07,930
You used my locator chip. Maldonado wanted me to keep an eye on you.

403
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:09,970
Okay.

404
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:18,670
You're lucky you got the partner with the bleeding heart.

405
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:36,520
What did you see... when you were under?

406
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:48,870
I saw someone who was close to me.

407
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:52,240
Someone who, I realize now,

408
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,570
that I should never have trusted.

409
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,930
I want to say I... I'm not even sure it's real, but...

410
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,830
But it was.

411
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:10,540
Who was it, John?

412
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:15,600
It was my ex-girlfriend.

413
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:19,910
When I came out of my coma, she had disappeared.

414
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:25,740
Now I know why.

415
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,060
Synthetic fail. Calibration required.

416
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:35,680
Synthetic fail. Calibration required. I've got a fix for that.

417
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:39,830
What? It gets creaky sometimes?

418
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:42,760
I've got a fix for that. Olive oil.

419
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,960
Olive oil?

420
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,320
Yeah, man. You put it right on the joint. Olive oil?

421
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,700
You'll thank me.

422
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,370
I suppose I, uh...

423
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:03,650
I should acknowledge the fact that you saved my life.

424
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:08,250
No need.

425
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:13,390
I only did it because you're my one ticket. Without you, I'm off the force.

426
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:15,530
You're lucky I want to be a cop so bad.

427
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:25,040
You're not like them, the MXs.

428
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,670
I don't know why, but you're not. I should take that as a compliment.

429
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,370
You should.

430
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:37,820
The MX series is based on first order predicate calculus.

431
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:40,970
MXs have no intuition, or as you might say, no soul.

432
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:44,950
For them, experience, memory is just recorded data.

433
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:48,990
My series is designed to draw conclusions, make inferences.

434
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,880
The answer is Vogel, right?

435
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,110
Who was targeting him, what was the payback for? Yeah.

436
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:59,920
And the only witness we have is Vogel's MX,

437
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,920
Who was blown apart when they took Vogel. Yeah, Ru-Rudy said his neural net was completely fried.

438
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,140
Worthless to another MX, who wouldn't be able to-to put it together, to make sense of it,

439
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,210
but you could make those connections.

440
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:15,560
If we transferred the memory, or whatever's left of the memory from Vogel's MX to you,

441
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:17,830
you could make the connection.

442
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:22,140
It's worth a shot, Detective. Check, please!

443
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,400
I'm in its short-term memory now.

444
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,670
Stand by. I'll be back. coffee... sugar.

445
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,950
Officer Vogel. It's good to see you again.

446
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:22,870
who are you

447
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:27,080
A few years ago, you logged something into evidence that doesn't belong to you.

448
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:30,150
You may remember it as case number 6663.

449
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:31,710
No?

450
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:34,580
Well, your precinct has been kind enough to hold it in evidence,

451
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:37,730
but tonight, we're gonna get it back,

452
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:39,530
and you're gonna help us do it.

453
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,120
We've got something they want.

454
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,700
Captain, we need to go into lockdown.

455
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,720
What's going on? They're hitting us tonight.

456
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,660
They're after something in the evidence room!

457
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,700
Light it up, take out the MXs.

458
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:43,060
The Insyndicates are on the roof! Come on, now. Go, go, go, go, go!

459
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:45,540
Evacuate building.

460
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,300
Evacuate building. Why are they shutting down and not you?

461
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,550
They run on a different frequency than mine.

462
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:58,330
Sometimes newer technology isn't better.

463
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,800
Come on.

464
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,310
Open the valves.

465
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,180
We got to go through every piece by hand. We don't even know what we're looking for.

466
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,310
We know it's here.

467
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:28,550
And we know it's valuable because they were willing to kill a lot of cops to get it.

468
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:33,860
There must be some way to restore those evidence files that were wiped.

469
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:38,330
I've been trying, but the sabotage was extremely thorough.

470
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,360
I'll keep trying.

471
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,270
Thanks, man.

472
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,650
Rise...

473
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,560
and be counted.

474
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,430
Stay out of trouble.

475
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:19,210
Your father would have loved this place.

476
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:24,160
Oh, I can't wait to get back to you.

477
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:26,690
I know I have to wait a week,

478
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:31,350
but what I really wish is that you were here with me.

479
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:40,950
We're gonna find her, John.

480
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:52,850
If you hadn't come back...

481
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:57,760
You saved a lot of lives.

482
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:02,420
Thanks.

483
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:05,290
Thanks for insisting.

484
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:15,980
You put in the rec order.

485
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:19,110
For Dorian. I checked out his record.

486
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:23,580
It's mostly redacted, but I saw that it was you who put in the request for me to get him. Why?

487
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:25,690
The DRN is good for you.

488
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:33,870
Sandra... you didn't answer my question.

489
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:37,270
Why Dorian? 'Cause he's special.

490
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:41,800
Just like you. See you at roll call.

491
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:54,120
I assume you want quiet mode, Detective?

492
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:59,420
Not necessarily.

493
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:04,810
Call me John.

494
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:11,400
