00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,430
目前来看是这样
It seems that way.

160
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,760
怎么会
How?

161
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,070
是啊 怎么会呢
Correct. How?

162
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,340
啊 好了
Ah, there you go.

163
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,940
很好 很好
Perfect, perfect.

164
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,040
看看你 动来动去的小怪物
Oh, look at you. Wriggle monster.

165
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,380
好了
Okay.

166
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,750
妈妈帮你拿这个
Mommy'll take it then.

167
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,050
擦擦你的手 擦擦你的脸
Give me your hands, give me your face.

168
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,420
真漂亮
Beautiful.

169
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,720
又发生了一起绑架案
Another abduction happened.

170
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,190
跟妮可・布鲁姆奎斯特的案子一样
Same M.O. as Nicole Bloomquist.

171
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,350
二十多岁 女性 案发地是停车场
20-something female, parking structure.

172
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:21,320
监控摄像头坏了 没有留下关于绑架的任何录像
Cameras were disabled. There's no surveillance of the abduction.

173
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,590
我还找到了三起和这个案子类似的人口失踪案
And I found three more missing persons cases with the same pattern.

174
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,530
这么说 他们关了摄像头 绑架了那个女人
So, they kill the cams and then take the women.

175
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,770
是 不过这次有所不同 他们漏了一个
Yeah, except this time, something was left behind.

176
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:38,540
他叫维克多 当时在车里
He was in the car. His name is Victor.

177
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,240
我可以和他聊聊吗
Can I talk to him?

178
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,440
还是我去吧
Maybe I should talk to him.

179
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,750
- 他不太会和孩子打交道 - 嘿
- He's not good with kids. - Hey.

180
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,080
- 还有猫 - 胡说...胡...
- Or cats. - That-That's not...

181
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,680
我跟孩子很处得来 真的
I'm great with kids, really.

182
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,870
嗨
Hey.

183
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,740
我是肯尼思警官
I'm Detective Kennex.

184
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,240
你应该就是维克多 对吗
You must be, uh, Victor, right?

185
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,680
维克多是...是个好名字
Victor's a-a good name.

186
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,210
是个强大 无所畏惧的名字 
It's a good, strong name.

187
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,210
Victor本意是胜利者

188
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,420
听着 我知道这一定很难面对
Look, I know this must be hard...

189
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:25,590
但是我需要你勇敢起来
but I need you to be brave.

190
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,620
好吗
Okay?

191
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,960
你必须要告诉我你妈妈出了什么事
I really need you to tell me what happened with your mom.

192
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,220
你喜欢这个
You like him?

193
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,160
你想要我可以送给你
I'll give him to you if you want him.

194
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,530
但是你要向我保证会好好照顾他
But you got to promise me to look after him

195
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,300
因为他对我来说意义重大
because he means a lot to me.

196
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:09,230
- 我保证 - 你保证
- I promise. - You promise?

197
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,800
好的
Okay.

198
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,340
我相信你
I trust you.

199
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,340
听着 维克多
Look, Victor.

200
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,570
我真的很需要你的帮助
But I really need your help.

201
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:20,840
你要告诉我到底发生了什么
Need you to tell me what happened with your mom.

202
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,910
你们当时在车里 对吗
You guys were in a car, right?

203
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,380
你妈妈出去了
Your mom got out.

204
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,780
她去扔垃圾
She went to put the trash away.

205
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,090
然后发生了什么
Then what happened?

206
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,920
我看到一辆车
I saw the car.

207
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,590
你看到谁在车里了吗
Did you see who was in it?

208
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,530
两个男人
Two men.

209
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,230
两个男人
Two men?

210
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,060
然后发生了什么
What happened then?

211
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,070
车开走了
The car drove away.

212
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,770
是什么样的车什么颜色
What kind of car was it? What color?

213
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,970
是一辆很大的银色的车
It was a big, silver car.

214
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:53,940
很大的银色的车
A big, silver car.

215
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,120
棒极了
That's good.

216
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,850
我妈妈什么时候来
When is my mom coming?

217
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,030
嘿 维克多
Hey, Victor.

218
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:19,900
你做的很好
You did really good.

219
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,950
- 怎么了 - 现场勘查员通过录像在车库旁边的街区
- What's up? - CSI found the silver sedan on a traffic cam

220
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,840
发现了那辆银色轿车
a block from the parking structure.

221
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,540
它的车牌是属于一辆红色越野车的
The license plates tracked back to a red SUV.

222
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,780
他们用的是偷来的车牌
They're using stolen plates.

223
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:32,310
我们动用城市中所有车牌扫描仪寻找那些车牌
We got every plate scanner in the city looking for those tags.

224
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,720
我们会找到那辆车的
We'll find that car.

225
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:37,950
好的 两个女孩都被相同的手法绑架
Okay, two girls were abducted with the same M.O.

226
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:40,990
而其中一个的DNA在塞巴斯蒂安・琼斯被杀时
and one of them, her DNA was found on the sexbot

227
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,560
和他在一起的性爱机器人上找到
who was with Sebastian Jones when he was murdered.

228
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:43,990
我想我们应该寻找那个
I think we should focus on finding

229
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,530
和塞巴斯蒂安在一起的性爱机器人
the sexbot that was with Sebastian.

230
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,860
如果我们可以获取她的记忆 
If we can access her memory,

231
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,760
我们也许能看到那天晚上酒店里到底发生了什么
we might be able to see what happened in the hotel that night.

232
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,230
还可以确定是谁做的
And identify who did it.

233
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:52,370
这是寻找两名失踪者最好的办法
That's our best bet for finding the missing women.

234
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,000
诸位 我有了新线索
Guys, I might have a new angle.

235
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,840
我细查了你们找到的这些传票
I dug into those summonses you found.

236
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,210
塞巴斯蒂安以前的生意伙伴洛伦佐・肖
Sebastian's former business partner Lorenzo Shaw

237
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,140
曾起诉他侵犯知识产权
was suing him for intellectual property infringement

238
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,560
还有他刚在市中心开了一家性爱机器人展销厅 
and he just opened a sexbot showroom downtown for himself...

239
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,280
他有动机 他或许参与了这事
it's motive. He could be involved.

240
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,750
去查查他
Check him out.

241
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:12,490
刚才你和那孩子相处的异常融洽 约翰
You were surprisingly good with that kid back there, John.

242
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,990
尽管你用长颈鹿贿赂他
Even though you had to bribe him with a giraffe.

243
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,180
多谢夸奖
Thanks.

244
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,660
你觉得他妈妈还活着吗
Do you think his mother is still alive?

245
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,460
希望如此
I hope so.

246
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,800
每过一小时 她活着被我们找到的机会就减少一分
Every hour she's gone diminishes the chance of us finding her alive.

247
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,980
如果有人死了 你会怎么告诉一个小孩
What do you tell a small child when someone dies?

248
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,150
我从来没想过这个 你会怎么跟小孩讲
I've never considered that what you would tell a small child.

249
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,480
和对成年人说的话一样
Well, you say the same thing that you'd say to an adult.

250
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,050
对他们怎么说
What do they say?

251
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,620
你告诉他们死去的人
You tell them that the person that died

252
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:46,520
去了更美好的地方
has gone to a better place.

253
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,320
为什么他们会这么说
Why would anyone say that when there's no way

254
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,130
没人知道活着的东西死了之后会去哪
to really know where living things go when they stop living?

255
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:56,500
这是为了给他们希望和安慰
It's designed to give hope and comfort.

256
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,140
减轻痛苦
To ease the pain.

257
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:02,540
人们相信是因为他们必须相信
People believe it because they need to.

258
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,310
我的研究数据表明
Hmm, the data I've studied suggests

259
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,680
证明一个人存在过的最好方式是
that the best proof of one's existence

260
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:11,070
在他们死去后有人会纪念他们
is if one is remembered after they're gone.

261
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,720
有人告诉过你搭档的儿子
Was your partner's son told that his father

262
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,490
他爸爸去了更美好的地方吗
went to a better place?

263
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,920
我不知道
I don't know.

264
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:24,730
你从没跟你搭档的儿子讲过话吗
You never spoke to your partner's son?

265
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,970
我理解你为什么会觉得这事很难面对
I can understand why that would be hard for you.

266
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,430
你们把我儿子怎么了
What did you do with my son?

267
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,260
别担心
Don't worry.

268
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,360
现在相关机构会管他的
The authorities will have him by now.

269
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,500
你看 我们...我们不是坏人 
You see, we're... we're not monsters.

270
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,470
我有钱 你想要什么都可以 我什么都给你
I have money! Anything you want, anything. I'll give you anything.

271
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,840
求你 我就想见我的儿子
Please, I just want to see my son...

272
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:12,440
我已经有了
I already have

273
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,010
我想要的东西
what I want.

274
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,550
不 不 不
No, no, no!

275
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,180
你的前生意伙伴
Your ex-partner,

276
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:26,010
塞巴斯蒂安・琼斯
Sebastian Jones,

277
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,750
你最后一次见他是什么时候
when was the last time you saw him?

278
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,950
半年前 还是七个月前
Six months? Seven?

279
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,080
我们最近闹翻了
We'd been sort of on the outs lately.

280
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,550
"闹翻了"
"On the outs"?

281
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:34,790
你起诉他了
You were suing him.

282
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:38,890
我对我们在奥利瑞安一起改进的作品有知识产权
I have intellectual property rights on designs we developed together at Orillian.

283
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,160
既然塞巴斯蒂安裸了 知识产权会发生什么变化
What happens to the I.P. rights now that Sebastian's naked?

284
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:45,160
我的意思是"死了"
Um, I mean "dead."

285
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,700
现在塞巴斯蒂安死了 知识产权有什么变化
Now that Sebastian's dead. What happens to the I.P. rights?

286
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:50,670
它们自然归给我了
Well, they would naturally revert to me.

287
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:58,240
这是你做的模型吗
Is this one of your models?

288
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,140
不 她不是我的
No, she's not mine.

289
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,310
那这个呢
What about this one?

290
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,820
还有这个
Or this one?

291
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:06,480
你之前见过这些女人吗
You ever seen these women before?

292
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,150
没有 但她们不是人造人
No, but they're not synthetics.

293
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:10,120
- 你怎么这么肯定 - 我是做这行的
- How can you be sure? - In my line of work,

294
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,390
自然明白
you get to know.

295
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,390
我有很长一段时间没见到你这种型号了
You know, I haven't seen one of you in a while.

296
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:18,460
最新的性爱机器人加入了一点你的老技术
The latest sexbots have a little bit of your old tech in them.

297
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,830
她们能和她们的服务对象
They're capable of bonding empathetically

298
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:22,300
建立情感纽带
with their clients.

299
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:23,970
能感受他们的心情
Sense their moods...

300
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,240
然后作出相应的反应
and respond accordingly.

301
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:28,310
这是个重大的成就
It's a significant achievement.

302
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:30,040
如果你的机器人这么特别
If your bots are so special,

303
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,840
为什么塞巴斯蒂安会债务缠身
why was Sebastian so in debt?

304
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,880
如果你认识塞巴斯蒂安 你就会明白
Well, if you knew Sebastian, you'd understand.

305
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:35,580
他曾经是个艺术家
He was an artist.

306
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:36,880
我们一起赚了很多钱
We were making good money.

307
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,950
不过后来他决定发展新业务
But he was determined to create the next line.

308
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,120
要比之前的更好
Better than the last.

309
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:42,450
他把所有的钱都砸了进去 建设新的工厂
He sunk all our capital into new fabs,

310
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,360
购买器材 编制子系统
tooling, subsystems.

311
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,160
他把整个公司都赌在这上面
He bet the whole company on it.

312
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,360
接着我们最大的客户撤销了与我们的合同
And then our biggest client canceled their contract with us.

313
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:50,960
让我们措手不及
Took us completely by surprise.

314
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,060
也让我们破产了
Bankrupted us.

315
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,030
你们最大的客户是谁
Who was your biggest client?

316
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:58,600
如果你不想告诉我 那也没关系
Ah, if you don't want to tell me, that's okay.

317
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,840
我们只要命你交出交易记录
We'll just subpoena your records.

318
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,710
挨个检查它们 顺便让你关几天门就够了
Shut you down for a few days while we go through them.

319
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,750
是一个阿尔巴尼亚的财团
It was an Albanian consortium.

320
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,680
他们说过他们正在撤销中间商
They said they were cutting out the middle man.

321
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:11,420
你是说他们找到了新的供应商
You mean they found a new supplier?

322
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:12,380
显而易见
Apparently.

323
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,750
塞巴斯蒂安不相信有人
Sebastian couldn't believe that anyone could build

324
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,390
能作出比我们更好的性爱机器人
a better sexbot than us.

325
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,890
我给你看的第一张图
The first picture I showed you.

326
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,960
她是不是阿尔巴尼亚公司的
Did she belong to the Albanians?

327
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:23,290
是不是因为她 塞巴斯蒂安那晚在酒店才被杀的
Is she why Sebastian was at the hotel the night he was killed?

328
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:27,630
我不知道
I wouldn't know.

329
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:29,700
听着 我不想再谈这些了
Look, I-I don't want to talk about this anymore.

330
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,340
他们威胁你了吗
Did they threaten you?

331
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:33,640
没有
No...

332
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,970
他们是很好的客户 总是按时付钱
They were good clients. They always paid on time.

333
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:38,380
我能说的就这么多了
And that's all I'm gonna say about them.

334
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,710
抱歉 我还有顾客
Excuse me. I have customers.

335
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,410
肖先生
Mr. Shaw?

336
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:43,780
你有没有听说过有人
Have you ever heard of people

337
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:46,680
把人类DNA嵌入性爱机器人身上
incorporating human DNA into a sexbot?

338
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:49,950
那是违法的
That's illegal.

339
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:52,290
我觉得你们应该知道这个
And I think you know that.

340
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,270
你可以说你不喜欢机器人
You can say you don't like robots all you want.

341
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,970
不过你的心跳证明你在撒谎
Your pulse says otherwise.

342
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,170
什么
What?

343
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:10,010
我说的非常清楚
Precisely.

344
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:13,740
我想要你侵入肖的顾客网络
I want you to hack into Shaw's customer network.

345
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,880
找到阿尔巴尼亚人
Find the Albanians.

346
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:17,750
我们不需要许可吗
We don't need a warrant?

347
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,320
的确如此
I agree.

348
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,920
找到了
Got it.

349
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,760
五星好评
Five star rating.

350
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,400
计划是什么
What's the plan?

351
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:34,030
煽风点火
Stir the pot.

352
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:59,850
他们在寻找拥有人类DNA的机器人

353
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:11,200
把手从口袋里拿出来
Hands out of your pockets.

354
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,640
- 你见过这个机器人吗 - 没有
- You seen this bot? - No.

355
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,770
没有吗
No?

356
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:16,710
- 见过这个机器人吗 - 没有
- Seen that bot? - No, no...

357
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,680
我们测试了所有的机器人
We tested all the bots.

358
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,550
他们都通过了 没问题
They all check out. They're clean.

359
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,550
好的 谢谢
Okay, thanks.

360
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,880
没错
Yup.

361
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,120
警官们
Officers.

362
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:36,440
我是经理 有什么能帮助的吗
I'm the manager. Can I help you?

363
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,860
这是你们这儿的机器人吗
Is this one of your bots?

364
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,690
不是
No.

365
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:44,130
我们这儿有很多选择 能给你找到一个相像的
We got a great selection here. We can get you pretty close to this one.

366
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:47,000
我们的机器人全都通过了测试
Our bots have passed all the required tests.

367
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,510
警察还有优惠价
Special rate for cops.

368
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,840
我们喜欢警察
We love cops.

369
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:50,870
没错
Yeah.

370
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,440
- 我们喜欢警察 - 好的 很好
- We love cops. - Well, great.

371
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,280
如果你答出了我所有的问题
If you answer all of my questions,

372
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:57,780
我也许会考虑你们的服务
maybe I'll let you get to first base.

373
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,290
你是不是从塞巴斯蒂安・琼斯和洛伦佐・肖那进的货
You ever buy from Sebastian Jones and Lorenzo Shaw?

374
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,290
以前是
We used to.

375
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,160
- 现在不是了 - 为什么
- Not anymore. - Why'd you stop?

376
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:06,170
我们自产自销
We make our own now.

377
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:08,660
你们确定其中没有一个长成这样的
And you're sure that's not one of them?

378
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,260
之前说过了
Already said.

379
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,630
约翰
John.

380
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,830
斯特尔警员有话要和我们说
Detective Stahl needs to talk to us.

381
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,470
谢谢你 先生
Thank you, gentlemen.

382
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,610
他的生命特征表明他在撒谎
His vitals suggest that he is lying.

383
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,510
没错
Yup.

384
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,980
也可能是他非常讨厌你
Or he doesn't like you very much.

385
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:31,020
把他加到小孩和猫的那一栏里
Add him to the list of kids and cats.

386
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:37,390
我们追踪到那辆银色轿车了
We got a hit for the silver sedan.

387
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:40,120
就是在停车场绑架克里斯汀・海斯曼的那辆
The one that kidnapped Kristen Haseman in the parking garage.

388
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,330
我们在扫描仪里发现了它的踪迹
We picked it up on a plate scanner.

389
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,430
多利安 你看那辆轿车
Dorian, watch the sedan as it goes

390
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,930
在扫描仪里记录的影像
past the scanner.

391
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,440
他的车牌变了
The license plate changes.

392
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,200
他们用了车牌干扰器
They're using a tag scrambler.

393
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,100
我们也发现了 所以转换成了直接监控录像
Once we realized that, we switched to straight surveillance cams

394
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,080
并且发现它进入了第八大街的一个工业设备厂
and tracked it to an industrial facility off 8th Street.

395
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,710
他们在那干嘛
What were they doing there?

396
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,450
不知道 他们在那呆了二十分钟
I don't know, they were there for 20 minutes,

397
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,120
之后我们就找不到他们了
and then we lost 'em.

398
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,950
好吧 我们三分钟之内赶过去
All right, we're three minutes out.

399
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:27,710
那是什么东西
What the hell is that?

400
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,170
是克里斯汀・海斯曼吗
Is that Kristen Haseman?

401
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:31,580
不是人类
It's not human.

402
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:41,050
是酒店的那个女机器人
This is the android from the hotel.

403
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,120
如果他们是这么对待性爱机器人的
If this is what they're doing to their sexbots,

404
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,960
可以想象他们对抓来的女人会做些什么
imagine what they're doing to the women they've abducted.

405
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,430
漂亮的绿眼瞳
Beautiful green.

406
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:05,440
他们把颜色调得刚刚好
They really have got the color just right.

407
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:07,240
这些枪眼就是为了
You see, these shots were targeted

408
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:09,870
粉碎外皮的继电器和存储中心的
precisely to shatter the cortical relays and storage centers.

409
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:11,110
他们销毁了她的记忆
They destroyed her memory.

410
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,580
当然了 他们要确保不会有人
Yeah, they wanted to ensure no one

411
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:16,610
通过她的记忆找到塞巴斯蒂安・琼斯的凶手
could retrieve her recorded memories of Sebastian Jones' murder.

412
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:20,280
- 这些白化人知道他们在做什么 - 是阿尔巴尼亚人
- These albinos knew exactly what they were doing. - Albanians.

413
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,150
那 那就说的通了
Well, that, that would make more sense.

414
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:23,530
但她的外壳可能会
But there is a small chance

415
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:25,890
一定程度上保护她的记忆不受损
that her temporal housing might be intact enough

416
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,230
我们就可以来播放她的声像记忆
to salvage some of her echoic memory.

417
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,160
她可能告诉我们那些人
Uh, she might still be able to tell us

418
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,560
对她做了什么
something about the people that did this.

419
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:35,500
抱歉 伙计
Apologies, mate.

420
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:37,370
我做这个的时候通常都是一个人
I'm used to being alone when I do this.

421
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,140
- 你可以不用看 - 没关系
- You might want to look away. - It's fine.

422
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:44,680
为什么他们要把它的皮肤去掉
Why did they peel its skin off?

423
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:46,880
显然他们不想我们找到线索
Well, they obviously didn't want us to see that either.

424
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:48,410
等下
Wait a minute,

425
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:49,980
酒店的监控器发现
the surveillance footage at the hotel.

426
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,980
她的手留下的是人类DNA
Her hands left traces of human DNA.

427
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,950
你觉得他们绑架这些女的是为了她们的皮肤
You think they're abducting the girls to harvest their skin.

428
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:56,850
如果使用人类皮肤
If you used human skin,

429
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:59,390
那你就造出了最好的性爱机器
you'd make the best sex machines on the market.

430
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:01,960
我想塞巴斯蒂安发现这个方法了 所以他们杀了他
I think Sebastian found out about it. That's why they killed him.

431
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:03,960
性爱机器 机器炮友
Sex machine, bang bot?

432
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,600
有点目光短浅 对吧
It's a bit myopic, isn't it?

433
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:08,360
不是每个找性爱机器人的人都是为了性爱
Not everyone who visits a sexbot is looking for sex.

434
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,270
有些人是为了交流
Some people go for the conversation

435
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:13,400
或是结束了应付某些无事不登门的人之后
or for a sympathetic ear at the end of a long working day

436
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,270
拖着疲惫的步伐
surrounded by people who only ever come to visit

437
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:16,910
寻找倾听者
when they want something from you.

438
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:25,420
我只是想说
I'm just saying that, uh,

439
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:28,020
神经界面很精密
the neural interface is quite sophisticated.

440
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,050
总之 可以看出
Anyway, it appears

441
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:33,120
他们利用被绑架女子的DNA来制造皮肤
they're growing skin using DNA from the abducted women.

442
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,990
再好的人造皮和真正的皮肤相比还是有很大差距
Well, synthetic skin, as good as it is, is a long way from the real thing.

443
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:39,130
还需要加入能带来吸引力的 
There are pheromones and other biological features

444
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,330
信息素和其他生物特征
that trigger attraction.

445
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,240
找到了
Here it is.

446
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,980
完了 彻底被毁
Sorry, it's too damaged.

447
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:55,940
如果你想知道这些机器人在哪制造 
If you want to know where these bots are coming from,

448
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:58,550
就要给我一个活着的机器人
I'm going to have to get my hands on a live one.

449
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,070
你懂我的意思
So to speak.

450
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,860
你很安静
You're quiet.

451
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,630
怎么了
What's wrong?

452
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:19,170
刚才看到鲁迪桌子上的机器人
Just looking at that bot on Rudy's table

453
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,260
让我开始思考
makes me think,

454
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:24,310
谁会记得我
who is going to remember me?

455
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:30,550
你是个警察
You're a cop.

456
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,720
你帮助过的人都会记得你
The people you help will remember you,

457
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,950
不管你叫什么
whatever your name is.

458
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:43,490
说到名字 刚有人回复你的交友信息了 约翰
Speaking of names, someone just responded to your dating profile, John.

459
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:45,400
我的交友信...我以为你开玩笑的
My dating pro... I thought you were kidding.

460
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:48,300
不开玩笑 我见过你看那些性爱机器人时的神情
Not kidding... I saw the way you were looking at those sexbots.

461
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:49,870
你的用户名是
Your profile name is...

462
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,670
理查医生
Dr. Richard.

463
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,170
- 理查医生 - 喜欢乳蛋饼
- Dr. Richard. - Who likes quiche,

464
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,510
- 在沙滩上漫步 听轻柔的爵士乐 - 你不要叫我理查医生了
- long walks on the beach, smooth jazz. - You seriously did not call me Dr. Richard.

465
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,360
我以为你想约个会
I thought you wanted to meet someone.

466
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,110
我约了很多女人了 不需要你的帮助
I meet plenty of women. I don't need your help.

467
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:03,350
我进行了生物扫描 你的睾丸已经蓄势待发了
I-I ran a bio scan, and it looked like your testicles were at full capacity.

468
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,510
你扫描了我的蛋蛋
You're scanning my balls?

469
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:06,130
我并不享受那个过程 我只是... 
I didn't enjoy it, i just...

470
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:09,450
- 我的天 疯了 - 我没有办法不注意到你的蠢蠢欲动
- Oh, my God, this is unbelievable. - I can't help but notice you're backed up.

471
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:11,390
你这是什么毛病
What is the matter with you?

472
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:20,930
别再扫描我的蛋了
Don't scan my testicles ever again.

473
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:21,970
知道了
Copy that.

474
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,480
她长什么样
What does she look like?

475
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,610
你希望她什么样
What do you want her to look like?

476
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:37,580
深情的棕眼睛
Brown eyes, soulful.

477
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,880
身高
Height?

478
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:42,990
标准就行 我喜欢小麦色皮肤的
Average height. I like brunettes.

479
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,590
你会和同行交往吗
Would you date anyone in your profession

480
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:47,160
或者说你更喜欢和非同行交往
or would you prefer to date someone outside of it?

481
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:49,890
都可以
Sure, either way.

482
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:54,600
我喜欢聪明的女人 比我聪明的女人
I like smart women, you know, women that are smarter than me.

483
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:56,170
这不难找
That won't be hard.

484
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:02,810
你知道你刚才描述的就是斯特尔警探 对吧
You are aware that you just described. Detective Stahl, right?

485
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,280
肯尼思
Kennex.

486
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:11,580
嘿 我们找到你说的银色轿车了
Hey, we got a 20 on the silver sedan you posted.

487
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,520
我刚刚上传给多利安
I just uploaded it to Dorian.

488
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:16,190
好的 谢啦
Uh, okay, thank you, um,

489
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:18,960
斯特尔警探 谢啦
Detective Stahl, thanks.

490
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:22,190
- 好啦 谢谢 斯特尔警探 - 闭嘴
- Okay, thank you, Detective Stahl. - Shut up.

491
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:24,960
给我闭嘴
Shut it, zip it.

492
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:33,940
警察
Police!

493
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:36,440
举起手来 不许动 把手放在仪表盘上
Hands up! Hands on the dash! Don't you move! Put your hands on the dashboard!

494
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:37,870
抓住他们 别让他们乱动 
Hold 'em, keep 'em there!

495
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:39,480
不许动 赶紧把手放在仪表盘上
Do not move! Put your hands on the dashboard now

496
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:41,240
- 放到我能看到的地方 - 转过去
- where I can see 'em! - Turn around, turn around!

497
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,510
从车里出来
Step out of the car.

498
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,350
过来
Come on.

499
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,520
到前面来
Around front.

500
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,970
嗨 我是瓦妮莎
Hi, I'm Vanessa.

501
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,300
- 嘿 你好吗 - 我需要一个DNA样本
- Hey, how you doing? - I need to take a DNA sample.

502
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,270
请张开嘴
Open your mouth, please.

503
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,270
为什么
Why?

504
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:12,380
我已经通过所有测试了
I've passed all my tests.

505
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:14,010
劳驾
Please.

506
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,400
她的DNA属于罗琳・怀特
Her DNA belongs to a Lorraine White,

507
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:39,070
她两个月前在圣克莱尔被绑架
abducted from a parking structure two months ago in St. Clair.

508
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:46,140
实验室
Lab.

509
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,310
鲁迪
Rudy,

510
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,610
给你找了些皮肤
found you some skin.

511
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,370
阿尔巴尼亚人不会告诉我们被绑架的人在哪
The Albanians aren't telling us where the kidnap victims are.

512
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,070
我们得从性爱机器人那里收集信息
We need to get that information from a sexbot.

513
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,340
已经有三个女孩失踪了
We have three missing girls out there

514
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:42,340
可能还有更多女孩失踪
somewhere, maybe more.

515
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:43,970
我会尽我所能来解决这个案子
I'll pull everything I can from it.

516
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,190
又见面啦
Hello again.

517
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,560
一个人类的DNA被用来合成你的皮肤
A human's DNA was used to make your skin.

518
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,830
这个女人
This woman.

519
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,160
我们得找到她 时间不多了
We need to find her. We don't have much time.

520
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:08,900
你以前见过她吗
Have you seen her before?

521
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,440
没
No.

522
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:13,270
你仔细想想
I need you to think.

523
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,040
这很重要
It's really important.

524
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:17,410
你见过她吗
Have you seen her?

525
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,680
没
No.

526
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:21,410
你在哪里生产出来的
Where were you made?

527
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:24,980
你主人是谁
Who owns you?

528
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,230
你知道你在哪里出生的吗
Do you know where you were born?

529
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:38,600
你跟这个女孩工作过吗
You ever worked with this girl?

530
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:44,070
沙琳
Charlene.

531
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,570
是的 沙琳
Right, Charlene.

532
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,910
你知道她在哪出生的吗
Do you know where she was born?

533
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:52,240
你们的主人是谁
Who owns you?

534
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:58,380
她可能不太理解这些词
She's probably not conscious of those terms.

535
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:04,390
今晚这些人要把你带去什么地方
Where were those men taking you tonight?

536
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,820
他们想载我一程
They were taking me for a ride.

537
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:08,060
我们认为他们载你是想要毁掉你
We think they were taking you to be destroyed.

538
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:10,230
为什么有人想要毁掉我
Why would anybody want to destroy me?

539
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:14,560
跟我在一起有好多好多乐子可享受呢
There are much, much better things to do with me.

540
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:18,200
如果你不愿意的话 我们可以什么都不做
We don't have to do anything if you don't want to.

541
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:22,110
我很善于倾听
I'm a very, very good listener.

542
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:25,780
你知道 人们通过不同方式寻求联系
You know, people look for connections in different ways.

543
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:27,950
但所有人都在寻找的
That's all people are looking for,

544
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:30,310
就是有人关心他们
is someone who cares about them.

545
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:33,320
这也是我在这里的原因
That's what I'm here for.

546
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:38,560
你知道沙琳在哪吗
Do you know where Charlene is?

547
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:40,690
知道
Yes.

548
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:41,960
我能见她吗
Can I see her?

549
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:45,300
为什么你要见她
Why do you want to?

550
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,930
我不知道
I don't know.

551
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:52,570
你被设计来跟人们建立联系
You were designed to bond with people.

552
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,310
这是你的使命
That's what you were developed to do.

553
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:58,510
即察觉他们的存在
To notice when they're there.

554
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:03,450
也就是说他们不在的时候你也能察觉到
That also means you notice when they're not there.

555
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,620
这就是你要见她的原因
That's why you want to see her.

556
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:07,780
就是你的感觉
That's what you're feeling.

557
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:13,880
是谁让你跟今晚我们找到的那些人走的
Who told you to go with the men we found you with tonight?

558
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:16,960
尤里
Yuri.

559
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:20,830
你认识尤里吗
Do you know Yuri?

560
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:24,540
认识 我们认识
Yeah, we know Yuri.

561
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,010
我去楼上
I'm going upstairs.

562
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:41,250
闪开
Move!

563
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,700
该走了

564
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,720
什么都不要带

565
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,640
摧毁实验室

566
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:11,940
她们会死的

567
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:15,470
她们还能生长很多皮肤

568
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:16,830
我们会在别处再建一个实验室

569
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,040
快点走

570
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:21,230
你先走
You go first.

571
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,340
他们不在这儿
They're not here.

572
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:37,340
这不是那栋楼
This isn't the right building.

573
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,380
办公室也是空的
Office is empty, too.

574
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:13,710
我想我能找到皮肤实验室
I think I can find the skin lab.

575
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,240
鲁迪 
Rudy?

576
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:16,310
怎么了 多利安
Yes, Dorian?

577
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:18,010
这些性爱机器人大部分是建立在
Most of these sexbots are platformed

578
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,680
旧的尤朱诺悬挂式学习模块的平台上
on an old UJuno Pendant Learning Module.

579
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:24,430
是啊 自从我们停止在DRN上使用它们之后
Uh, yeah, uh, those modules were available to the public sector

580
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:26,620
那些模块就对公众开放了 
once we stopped using them on the DRNs.

581
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:28,990
问题在于它们会发出多余的GPS信号
Problem was that they were giving off an unwanted GPS signal.

582
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:31,220
是啊 这是个烦人的副作用
Yeah, it was an unwanted side effect.

583
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:35,240
每当它们自动更新它们的软件时 
Um, whenever they, uh, automatically updated their software,

584
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,570
就会不经意发出信号
they'd inadvertently send out a signal

585
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:41,000
这样那些想找到你的人就有路可循了
allowing those so inclined to, uh, track you.

586
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:42,470
那个东西有没有日志
Is there a log of that?

587
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,560
我想一定有
I'm sure there is.

588
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:46,040
你能不能进入瓦妮莎内部的GPS日志
Can you access Vanessa's internal GPS log

589
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:49,580
来找出那个模块第一次发出信号的时间
to find the very first time that the module sent a signal?

590
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:50,640
这是可实现的
It's possible.

591
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,950
如果我们能发现她第一次被激活的时间
If we can find out the first time she was activated,

592
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,650
- 我们就能找到... - 找到她的出生地点
- we can find... - Find out where she was born.

593
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,680
那个皮肤实验室
The skin lab.

594
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,350
好了 请耐心点
All right, bear with me.

595
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:03,090
不会太久的
It won't be a minute.

596
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,890
瞧瞧这个
Oh. Look at that.

597
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,430
那是我的充电器 用来... 不重要啦
That's the charger for my... doesn't matter.

598
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,160
我们开始吧
Um, here we go.

599
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,500
我需要的就是这个
This is the one I need.

600
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,900
好吧 你好
right. Uh, hello.

601
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:16,340
我需要进入你的数据端口
I need to access your data port.

602
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:17,770
听上去有点粗鲁
That sounds rude. Um,

603
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,240
我需要插入我的... 更难听了
I need to insert my... Oh, that's even worse.

604
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:22,510
哦 真友好
Um... Oh, friendly.

605
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:25,080
我向你保证 这跟性无关
Um, it's nothing sexual, I assure you.

606
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:27,050
倒不是说性有什么不好的
Not that there's anything wrong with sex.

607
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,750
我是说 谁不喜欢性呢
I mean, who doesn't like sex?

608
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:29,820
反正我喜欢
Not me.

609
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:31,720
我是说 我喜欢 这才是重点
I mean, I do. That's-that's the point.

610
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:34,320
但那样的话 至少是不太恰当
But that would be, um, inappropriate at best.

611
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:36,190
我保证 这不会痛的
This is not gonna hurt, I promise you.

612
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,690
这就好
There we go.

613
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,630
好吧
right.

614
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:42,760
让我
Just, um...

615
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,900
看一看你的...
having a look at your, uh...

616
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,200
数据
...statistics.

617
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:58,210
看起来你是在金斯敦高地第一次被激活的
Looks like you were first activated in Kingston Heights.
