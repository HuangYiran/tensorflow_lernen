1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,700
星际之门亚特兰蒂斯  前情回顾
Previously on stargate atlantis...

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:05,700
这是什么东西
what is it?

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,960
总有一天  这能让我们对幽灵族完全免疫
Something that will one day make us completely immune to the wraith.

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,390
我们打算用你的囚犯
We want to test the serum's effectiveness

5
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:11,300
测试血清的效果
Against your prisoner.

6
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,660
我们说的是把一个人类
We're talking about

7
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:13,700
与一名饥饿的幽灵人
Putting a human being in the same room

8
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,130
关在同一间屋子里
As a starving wraith.

9
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,560
一名晚期的重症患者自愿
The test subject is a terminally ill patient

10
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,260
做这次测试的对象
Who has volunteered himself.

11
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,300
你对我做了什么
What have you done to me?

12
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,460
我们正在追踪飞马星系上
Now we've been tracking what appears to be

13
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,330
一例新变种疾病
A new sickness in the pegasus galaxy.

14
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,030
这种始于霍夫星上居民的
It's a unique protein originally created

15
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:31,000
独特蛋白质
By the inhabitants of a planet called hoff.

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,260
它被设计于干涉幽灵族的
It was designed to interfere

17
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,430
捕食机制
With the wraith's feeding mechanism,

18
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:34,700
使得他们对捕食过程免疫
Making them immune to the process.

19
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,300
它也会使捕食的幽灵人
It also killed the feeding wraith

20
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,830
和半数接种人类致死
And half the people who took it.

21
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,300
大家可别忘了
Well, let's not forget

22
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,360
迈克尔把这种经过修改的hoffan药
That michael spread the modified hoffan drug

23
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,660
散播到几十个甚至更多的星球
To dozens of worlds, possibly more.

24
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,030
我的意思是  谁也不清楚具体数目吧
I mean, no one knows for sure, right?

25
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,630
这意味着你们每次捕食
Which means that every time you feed,

26
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,160
都是在冒风险
You're taking a risk.

27
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,130
再来一次
Once more.

28
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,860
是你的坏消息啊
Bad news, I'm afraid.

29
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,230
明天你可要返校了
You'll have to go back to school tomorrow.

30
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,500
阿莫西林再持续服用三天
Maintain the amoxicillin for three more days.

31
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,160
就可以彻底康复
That should do the trick.

32
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,700
你这儿怎么了
Now, what do we have over here?

33
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,660
得重新换药了
All these dressings need to be changed.

34
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,200
可以去储藏室
Do you mind going back to the storeroom

35
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,160
拿点绷带过来吗
And getting some more bandages, please?

36
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,330
没问题  医生
Yes, doctor.

37
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:39,160
谢谢  另外
Thank you. besides that,

38
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,160
你看上去好多了  伙计
You're looking good, my friend.

39
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,100
邮件到了
Mail call.

40
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,030
中校
Colonel!

41
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,330
你们都来这儿干什么
What are you all doing here?

42
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,860
我们听说你需要些日常补给
Well, we heard you needed supplies,

43
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,100
所以就送过来些  顺便看看你近况如何
So we thought we'd come by and see how you were doing.

44
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,160
经历飞行 跳跃  还要穿越星门
A "hop, skip, and a jump from the gate"?

45
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,500
这也叫顺便过来啊
That's what you call that?

46
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,530
很高兴见到你  罗德尼
Nice to see you too, rodney.

47
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:52,660
最近还好吗  医生
How are you, doctor?

48
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,000
还不错  谢谢关心
Well, thanks.

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,460
这些应该就是我要的抗生素吧
I take it these are the antibiotics I ordered?

50
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,230
凯勒医生给的可不少
Dr. keller gave you a whole whack of them,

51
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,760
够你用一些日子了
So they should last for a while.

52
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,300
上帝  希望是真的
Ah, god, I wish that were true.

53
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,460
什么意思
What does that mean?

54
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,560
我最近一直在治疗
Well, I've been dealing with

55
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,000
Hoffan瘟疫幸存者带来的大量传染病
A number of infections from the hoffan plague survivors.

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,900
我只能勉勉强强应付得来
I can barely keep on top of it.

57
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,630
这里有Hoffan瘟疫幸存者?
Survivors of the hoffan plague here?

58
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,830
这个星球不在迈克尔的目标之列吧
This is not one of the planets that michael targeted.

59
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,060
是的  但这儿有很多人
No, but many of these people

60
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,930
都是从另一个叫巴拉的星球上来的
Actually come from another planet, balar.

61
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,960
他们成功从瘟疫中存活了下来
They managed to survive the plague,

62
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,130
但就在他们族人重新聚集
And just when they're starting

63
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,200
开始生活的时候
To get their pieces back together,

64
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,400
幽灵人出现了
The wraith showed up,

65
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,800
力图将他们赶尽杀绝
Tried to wipe them out.

66
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,830
我们听到过类似的传闻
Mm, we heard rumors about that.

67
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,200
幽灵人很不乐意
Well, the wraith aren't too pleased

68
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,300
有人能够免疫于
To have whole populations out there

69
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,500
他们的吸食啊
That are immune to their feeding.

70
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,560
只有少数的巴拉人存活了下来
Just a handful of the balarans survived.

71
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,030
当地人很善良的接纳了他们
The locals were kind enough to take them in.

72
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,730
医生
Doctor?

73
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:34,730
诺瓦
Novo!

74
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:36,000
这些是从亚特兰蒂斯来得朋友
These are my friends from atlantis.

75
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,500
谢帕德·中校  泰勒  若男
Colonel sheppard, teyla, ronon,

76
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,130
罗德尼·麦凯博士
And dr. rodney mckay.

77
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,260
这位是诺瓦
This is novo.

78
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,400
一直在我的诊所里帮忙
She's been helping me here in the clinic.

79
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,130
很高兴见到你
Pleasure to meet you.

80
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:47,030
我也是  我听到过很多关于你们的事
You as well. I've heard a lot about you.

81
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:50,300
他就是那个人吗
Is he the one?

82
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,330
那个人?
The one what?

83
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,160
众多妙趣横生的故事都有你
From all the funny stories.

84
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,400
对了
Right!

85
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,900
大家都留下来吃晚饭吧
Yeah, well, I hope you all can stay here for dinner?

86
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,260
这里的食堂不算豪华
I mean, the canteen's not fancy,

87
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,500
不过他们用一种类似于山羊的
But they do serve up one heck of a stew,

88
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,130
生物炖的菜
Made from a goat-like creature.

89
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,130
味道好极了
Delicious!

90
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,160
类似于山羊?
Goat-like?

91
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,460
这主意不错
I think it's a great idea.

92
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,660
正好让我们有机会回忆下
Gives us a chance to catch up

93
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,760
那些..."妙趣横生的故事"
And relive all those... "funny stories."

94
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,230
在飞马星系这样的荒芜地带过得怎样啊
So how's life in the wilds of pegasus?

95
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:17,330
会怀念亚特兰蒂斯吧
You got to be missing atlantis by now.

96
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,760
令人惊讶地是  没有
Surprisingly, no.

97
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,900
得了吧
Oh, come on.

98
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,660
就不会想热水澡  游戏机  除臭剂
The hot baths, playstation, deodorant?

99
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,630
这儿可能看起来有点简陋
I know it seems a wee bit rough,

100
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,960
但事实上不是
But it's not, really.

101
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,630
不论在哪里  人们都对我很友好
Wherever I go, people are kind to me.

102
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,960
我一直都是衣食无忧
I never want for a meal or a place to sleep.

103
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,230
实话对你说
And to be honest with you,

104
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:34,800
我现在才真正感觉到
I'm really starting to feel like

105
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,860
我也可以贡献一份力量了
I'm making a difference.

106
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,000
怎么了
What is it?

107
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,230
幽灵人
Wraith.

108
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,300
有九个敌人
I count nine of 'em.

109
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,430
我们能搞定
We can take 'em.

110
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,430
不行  这里平民太多了
No. there's too many civilians.

111
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,500
这似乎不是平常的捕食
It does not appear to be an ordinary culling.

112
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,400
你怎么知道
How do you figure that?

113
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,230
首先  天上没有幽灵战机
Well, for one thing, there are no darts,

114
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:19,060
而且他们也没有要攻击村民的迹象
And they do not seem to be attacking the villagers.

115
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:31,330
你们之中谁说了算
Who among you speaks for the rest?

116
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,960
我是埃尔森
I'm elson...

117
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,630
这里的村长
Leader of this village.

118
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:43,130
你来这里有何贵干
What do you want with us?

119
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,990
你们最近收容了
You've recently taken in

120
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,990
其他星球上的一些难民
A group of refugees from another planet.

121
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,060
他们是瘟疫的幸存者
They are survivors of a plague.

122
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:53,070
你必须马上把他们交给我
It's important that you turn them over to me immediately.

123
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,120
为什么
Why?

124
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,800
你不需要知道原因
The reasons why do not concern you.

125
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,800
你要是肯定合作
Provided you cooperate,

126
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,350
我们会和平撤离
You have my word we will leave peacefully.

127
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,970
如果我们不呢
And if we don't?

128
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,860
那可不是个好决定
That would be a very unwise decision.

129
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:21,360
我们的蜂巢战舰会在黄昏前抵达
Our hive will be here before the night is through.

130
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,930
如果你执迷不悟
If you have not complied by then,

131
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,360
别怪我不客气了
I will give the word,

132
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,800
你的村庄会毁于一旦
And your entire village will be destroyed.

133
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,860
交出外来人
Turn over these outsiders,

134
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,430
就绕你们一命
And your lives will be spared.

135
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,800
抵抗的话
Resist,

136
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,800
就跟他们一块死吧
And you will all die together.

137
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,160
你看着办
The choice is yours.

138
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,130
我不明白
I don't understand.

139
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,830
他们都已经把我们家园毁了
They've already destroyed our homeworld.

140
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,230
为什么还要赶尽杀绝呢
Why would they hunt the rest of us down as well?

141
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,800
你没告诉他们?
You didn't tell them?

142
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,160
没彻底说明
Not the whole story.

143
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,060
你们在说什么
What are you talking about?

144
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,160
诺瓦  记得我告诉过你
Novo, remember when I told you that,

145
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,400
作为一个瘟疫的幸存者
As a plague survivor,

146
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,530
你们可以对幽灵人的捕食功能免疫
You'd be immune to the wraith feeding?

147
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:18,330
其实不仅仅是那样
Well, there's a bit more to it than that.

148
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:21,500
任何幽灵人企图捕食你或者类似的人时
Any wraith who tries to feed on you, or anyone like you,

149
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,300
其结果都是  他们立刻死亡
Will, as a result, die instantly.

150
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,530
你对他们来言是毒药
You're poison to them.

151
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,730
也就是说我们跟死了一样
Then we're as good as dead.

152
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:33,930
不一定
Not necessarily.

153
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,160
如果你们说得是真的
They won't tolerate our presence anywhere.

154
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,500
幽灵人不会容忍我们存在世上
Not if what you say is true.

155
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,000
那是因为他们在这里发现了你们
Just because they found you on this world

156
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,730
并不意味你们不能有其他藏身之处
Does not mean that there is nowhere you can hide.

157
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,460
诺瓦
Novo?

158
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,700
听说了吗
Did you hear?

159
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,730
是的
Yes.

160
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,930
这是塞法里斯  也是巴拉星人
This is sefaris. he's also from balar.

161
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:50,730
村里的议员们正在讨论
The councilors are meeting to discuss

162
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,430
是否遵从幽灵人的要求
Whether or not to heed the wraith's request.

163
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,060
什么  哪里
What? where?

164
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,500
在矿工办公室
The mine office.

165
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,630
我试图进去  可是他们不让
I tried to get in, but they turned me away.

166
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:00,460
若男和泰勒  去视察星门周围
Ronon and teyla, scope out the gate.

167
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,860
你们俩在这呆着
You two stay here.

168
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,160
照顾下他们
Watch these people.

169
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,100
能告诉我那个办公室在哪里吗
Can you show me where this mine office is?

170
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,630
没问题
Yes.

171
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,330
中校  你打算怎么跟他们说
Colonel, what are you going to say to them?

172
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,630
我去给他们指条明路
I'm going to give them another way out.

173
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:15,300
你是说  经历过这场瘟疫
You're telling us that, as a result of this plague,

174
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,100
巴拉星人变成了幽灵人的致命毒药
The balarans are now deadly to the wraith?

175
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,660
差不多
Pretty much.

176
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,630
所以幽灵人不会冒险
So the wraith would never risk

177
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,130
洗劫村子
Culling this village?

178
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,000
的确如此
Mm, that's true,

179
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,830
这也正是为什么他们希望
But that's also why they're willing

180
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,260
将你们赶尽杀绝的原因
To wipe you guys out completely.

181
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,460
一个无法洗劫的村子对他们可不是好事
A village that can't be culled is no good to them.

182
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,460
他们知道吗
Did they know?

183
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,330
什么
What?

184
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,830
巴拉人来这之前知道
Did the balarans know

185
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,360
他们的到来
They were bringing this curse upon us

186
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,630
为我们带来诅咒吗
When they came here?

187
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,900
不  他们懵然不知
No. they had no idea.

188
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,160
错不在他们   杰维斯
It's not their fault, jervis.

189
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,300
或许吧
Maybe not,

190
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,100
不过也无关重要了
But that doesn't matter.

191
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,460
除非这个银河系
The wraith won't rest

192
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:47,930
最后一个残存的人也断气  否则幽灵人不会善罢甘休
Until every last plague survivor in this galaxy is dead.

193
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:49,930
现在幽灵人对于他们的行踪毫无头绪
Except the wraith have no idea who they are

194
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,830
除非你们众人把他们供出来
Unless people like you point them out.

195
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:55,430
中校  我也不希望发生这样的事
I'm not happy about this either, colonel,

196
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:58,100
但我们还有别的选择吗
But what other choice do we have?

197
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,900
或许我们可以把你的人民
We may be able to move all your people

198
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,930
转移到别的星球
To a different planet,

199
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:06,260
一个安全的地方
Where they'll be safe.

200
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,260
你要我们离开家园?
You mean leave our homes?

201
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,300
我知道这不好受
I know it's not ideal,

202
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,600
但剩下的唯一选择就是
But the only other choice

203
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,800
供出那些清白无辜的人
Is to turn in a bunch of innocent people,

204
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,100
你们也不愿意做这个吧
And I know you guys aren't going to do that, right?

205
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,000
正如幽灵人所说  他们是外人
Well, as the wraith said, they're outsiders.

206
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,530
杰维斯
Jervis,

207
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,530
我们达成共识  让他们进来
We agreed to let them come here.

208
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:23,330
我没有
I didn't agree.

209
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:26,130
再者  那时他们还没造成威胁
Besides, they weren't a threat at the time.

210
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,500
如今大势已变
Now that's changed.

211
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,100
但他们已成了我们的一份子
But they've become like family.

212
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,500
诺瓦跟我同一个屋檐下生活
Novo lives under my roof.

213
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,430
同一张桌子上吃饭
She eats at my table.

214
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:36,930
我女儿很喜欢她
My daughter adores her.

215
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,500
你叫我怎么跟她说
What am I supposed to tell her?

216
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,200
难道你要我们全去送死
You'd prefer that we all be killed?

217
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,900
谢帕德中校  有情况
Colonel sheppard, come in.

218
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,500
失陪
Excuse me.

219
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,000
说
Go ahead.

220
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,630
若楠和我在星门附近
Ronon and I are at the gate.

221
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,960
那里的守卫尚不算森严
It does not appear to be heavily guarded.

222
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,300
是村庄看到的那帮人
It's the same guys from the village.

223
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,030
我认出他们的指挥官
I recognize the commander.

224
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:57,160
靠近他们的几率大吗
What are the odds of you two getting by 'em?

225
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,300
挺大的
Pretty good.

226
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,360
事实上  微乎其微
Slim, actually,

227
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,900
如果你和罗德尼也来  成数会高点
But much better if you and rodney join us.

228
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,060
那好吧
Yeah, all right.

229
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:07,300
我们到之前先按兵不动
Hold your position till we can get there.

230
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,860
怎么了
What is it?

231
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,560
这个村庄有多少口人
How many people are in this village?

232
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,560
600到700
600, 700.

233
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,330
时间可能有点紧  但我们尽量安排
Well, we'll be tight for time, but we can manage.

234
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:17,600
你有什么计划
What are you suggesting?

235
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,060
我们去引开幽灵人
We take the wraith out,

236
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:22,430
在蜂巢战舰到之前  让所有人穿过星门
Get everybody through the gate before the hive ship comes.

237
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:25,630
在我们重新安置你们之前  留在亚特兰蒂斯应该很安全
You should be safe in atlantis till we can relocate you.

238
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:29,530
无法接受
Unacceptable.

239
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:32,060
巴拉族不应受到如此对待
The balarans don't deserve this.

240
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,600
他们只是疾病的幸存者
They did nothing but survive a sickness.

241
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,460
有朝一日  我们也会如此
It could just as easily have happened to us.

242
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,960
如果我们供出他们
If we turn these people over,

243
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,860
我们就和凶残的幽灵人无异
We are no better than the wraith ourselves.

244
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,400
听着
Look.

245
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,500
即使你和幽灵人合作
Even if you cooperate with the wraith,

246
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,800
也不能保证
There's no guarantee

247
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,300
他们会信守诺言
They're going to keep their word.

248
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,300
也许他们会把你们全杀了  免得碍手碍脚
They may just kill all of you for being an inconvenience.

249
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,430
好吧
All right.

250
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:55,760
我们要做什么
What do you want us to do?

251
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,600
准备好转移
Be ready to move.

252
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,630
带上必需品
Take only what you can carry.

253
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,430
罗德尼  跟我走  我们去袭击幽灵人
Let's go, rodney. we're going to hit the wraith.

254
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:09,960
我们?
We are?

255
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,800
我跟你一起去
I'll come with you.

256
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,630
医生  别
Not a chance, doc.

257
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,860
中校
Colonel--

258
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,800
我没时间解释了
I don't have time to argue.

259
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,230
另外  还要组织大家转移
Get these people ready for transport.

260
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:16,500
当星门安全之后
Once the gate's secure,

261
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,200
我们要尽快行动
We're going to have to move fast.

262
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:22,360
好的  万事小心
Okay, but be careful.

263
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,660
如果要袭击
If we're going to attack,

264
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,700
得从那边开始
We got to do it from over there.

265
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,700
没错
Agreed.

266
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,700
一旦我们夺回星门
As soon as we take the gate,

267
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,230
得召些飞船来
We should call in some jumpers.

268
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,960
有助于撤空这里的村民
It'll make evacuating the village a lot faster.

269
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,700
加上我们可以运用飞船上的火力
Not to mention we can use the extra firepower

270
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,860
以防在转移过程中战舰提早到来
In case the hive gets here before we're done.

271
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,460
希望不要走到这一步
Oh, let's hope it doesn't come to that.

272
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,760
谢帕德中校  有情况
Colonel sheppard, come in.

273
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,830
说
Go ahead.

274
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,200
我们遇到难题了
We have a problem.

275
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,300
越来越多的幽灵人聚集在星门处
More of the wraith have begun arriving back.

276
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,830
他们一定是外出巡逻来了
They must have been out on patrol.

277
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:17,960
有多少
How many?

278
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,400
有机会突围吗
Can we still get out?

279
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,430
没有  我的意思是  我们被困了
No.from what i mean we're stuck here

280
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,380
你说  你能带我们走
You said you could get us out.

281
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,580
幽灵人的数目比我想的要多
Well, there are more wraith than we thought.

282
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,280
星门守卫森严
The gate's too heavily guarded.

283
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,450
我们被困了?
So we're trapped?

284
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:36,680
现在
For the moment.

285
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,980
我还没放弃希望
I haven't given up hope.

286
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,050
只是需要些许时间  拟定新的作战计划
I just need time to develop a new strategy.

287
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,950
你能制定什么计划
What strategy do you propose

288
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:43,180
来对付幽灵人大军
We use to defeat an army of wraith?

289
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,650
暂时不知道
Well, I don't know.

290
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:47,220
我还没仔细考虑
I haven't thought of it yet.

291
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,580
听着
Look,

292
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:51,320
最坏打算  如过我的组员和我再不回去
Worst-case scenario-- my team and I don't show up,

293
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,980
亚特兰蒂斯的人会利用星门拨号
The people back on atlantis will dial the gate

294
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,480
用无线电联系我们
And contact us by radio.

295
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,920
我们可以叫援兵
I can order back-up.

296
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,480
能赶在战舰来之前召集援兵吗
Will that happen before the hive ship arrives?

297
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,980
可能不会
Probably not.

298
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:01,980
我们等不了那么久
We can't wait that long.

299
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,250
就我们所知
For all we know,

300
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,180
幽灵人可能对战舰夸大其词
The wraith could be lying about the ship.

301
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,520
他们为什么要这么做
And why would they do that?

302
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,850
我说的是
I'm just saying,

303
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:10,250
我们要尽可能地拖延时间
We need to stall as long as possible.

304
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,580
这是疯子的行为
This is madness.

305
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,850
伊森  我们不能把
Elson, we have to think

306
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,280
村民的安全置之不理
Of the safety of our people.

307
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,380
我一直考虑的都是你们的安危
Oh, I'm thinking about the safety of your people.

308
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,720
你们全村的人
All your people!

309
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,950
我们不能指望他们的帮助
We can't rely on their help.

310
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:21,020
我们要自己做主
We have to make our own decisions.

311
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:23,550
我要时间好好考虑
I need time to think about this.

312
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,580
伊森  时间紧迫
The time for that has passed, elson.

313
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,580
我们得行动
We have to act.

314
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,720
如果你还犹豫不决
And if you're not prepared to do so,

315
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,380
我自己来做
Then I will.

316
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,420
杰维斯
Jervis!

317
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,180
他要做什么
What's he going to do?

318
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,720
我不知道
I don't know.

319
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,520
诺瓦和别的人哪去了
Where's novo and the others?

320
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,280
我们叫他们回去了  怎么了
We sent them home. why?

321
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,950
他们可以行走吗
Can these people walk?

322
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,650
应该可以
Well, if need be,

323
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:54,850
但我觉得  他们不能穿越星门
But I thought we couldn't get them through the gate.

324
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,150
我也认为如此  时间太紧了
No, we can't for the time being,

325
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:58,550
但留下也不安全
But I don't think they're safe here either.

326
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,280
拿起武器
Grab your weapons.

327
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,380
跟我来
Come with me.

328
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,450
让开
Get out of my way.

329
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:37,150
她不在这里  杰维斯
She's not here, jervis.

330
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,850
她在哪
Where is she?

331
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,350
我们该怎办  诺瓦
What are we going to do, novo?

332
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:01,550
我们得离开这个村子
We have to get out of the village.

333
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,380
外面发生什么事
What the hell's going on out there?

334
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,550
部分村民
Some of the villagers

335
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,820
决定自扫门前雪
Decided to take matters into their own hands.

336
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,320
我们去制止他们
Well, let's go stop 'em.

337
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,520
当务之急
First things first.

338
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,450
我们要撤离村民  拿些工具
We got to move these people. grab some gear.

339
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:32,780
我们不想惹事端
We don't want any trouble.

340
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,050
只要供出巴拉族人的下落
Just hand over the balarans.

341
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,420
我不认同
I don't think so.

342
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,350
中校  别让我难做
Don't make things difficult, colonel.

343
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:40,220
你错过了拯救村民的机会
You had your chance to save the village.

344
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:43,120
是时候让我挺身而出
Now it's my turn.

345
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,580
拯救村庄  你是这么认为的吗
Saving the village? that's what you call this?

346
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,920
你少管闲事
This isn't your affair.

347
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,620
这件事该怎么处理  是我们的事
It's up to us to decide how to deal with the situation.

348
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,820
是的  没错
Yes, it is,

349
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:55,350
杰维斯  但这不是我们的做法
But jervis, this is not our way.

350
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,520
我们的做法?
Our way?

351
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,480
我们的做法就是
Our way is what got us into this situation

352
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,880
自找麻烦
In the first place!

353
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,420
我们对他们已经是
We've already given them

354
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,720
仁至义尽
More than they could have ever asked for.

355
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,880
好吧
All right,

356
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,250
为何不将他们都杀了
Why not just shoot them right now

357
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,350
干脆了事
And get it over with?

358
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,450
横也是死  竖也是死
It's a death sentence anyway.

359
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:11,520
现在杀了他们
Shoot them yourself,

360
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,880
免得他们还要遭受
And spare them the torment

361
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,050
幽灵人的折磨
Of being tortured by the wraith.

362
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,220
你反倒帮了他们个大忙
You'd be doing them a favor.

363
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,320
卡森
Carson.

364
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,720
来吧  杀光他们
Go on! kill them all, then,

365
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,550
你当真如此想摆脱他们
If you're that desperate to be done with them!

366
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,780
你们犯大错了
You're making a big mistake.

367
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,150
或者吧
Maybe,

368
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:37,380
至少我们问心无愧
But at least we do so with a clear conscience.

369
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,880
已经无关重要了
Doesn't matter anyway.

370
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,420
你什么意思
What are you talking about?

371
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,280
我的手下已经把刚抓到的人
My men are already on the way to the gate

372
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,980
押往星门
With the first group we captured.

373
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,250
为时已晚
It's too late.

374
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,780
他们要对我们怎样
What are they going to do to us?

375
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,320
冷静点  塞法里斯  别吓着别人
Be calm, sefaris. you're scaring the others.

376
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,420
或许他们应该害怕
Maybe they should be scared.

377
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,380
我们都知道  这次我们无路可逃
We both know there's no escape from this.

378
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,520
我们不能放弃希望
We cannot give up hope.

379
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,150
勇敢地面对它  诺瓦
Face it, novo...

380
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:16,220
他们背叛了我们
We've been betrayed.

381
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,950
他们不想我们待在这里  一直视我们为外人
They don't want us here.They never did.

382
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:22,150
当我们离开自己家的时候就注定玩完了
We were doomed the moment we had to leave our homes.

383
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:24,820
想到...
And, to think...

384
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,480
作为幸存者
As a survivor,

385
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,550
我还一度以为自己是幸运的
I used to consider myself one of the lucky ones.

386
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,620
看好杰维斯没?
Is jervis taken care of?

387
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,080
他和那些人都被关起来了
He and his men have been locked up.

388
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,450
他们不会再惹麻烦了
They will not be giving us any more trouble,

389
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:39,750
尽管我觉得没必要打晕他们
Though I do not think it was necessary to stun them.

390
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,520
但那样感觉更好
Felt good, though.

391
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,920
现在怎么样
So what now?

392
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,150
我们要把剩下的巴拉人
Well, I got to get the rest of the balarans

393
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,180
迁移出村
Out of the village.

394
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,280
没有任何证据说
There's no telling if anybody else

395
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,850
其他人就不会有杰维斯这样的想法
Might feel the way jervis does.

396
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:48,850
那我们带他们去哪儿
Where should we take them?

397
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:50,180
森林里?
The forest?

398
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,220
大半夜的  那可要拖很远
It's kind of a long haul at night.

399
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,650
等一下  矿井怎么样
Wait a minute. what about the mine?

400
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:54,080
这些路就通向矿井
These tracks lead right down to it.

401
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,620
沿着走就行
I mean, we just follow them.

402
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,950
没人会迷路
No one gets lost.

403
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:57,950
完全正确
Exactly.

404
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,020
就这么办
All right.

405
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,020
回去找贝克特和他的病人
Go get beckett and his patients.

406
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,520
把他们带过来  我们集中其他人
Bring them here. we'll round up everyone else.

407
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:19,050
怎么了
What is it?

408
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:20,980
肯定发生了什么事
Something's happening.

409
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,020
什么事
What's going on?

410
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,280
你们马上要转移
You'll be moving shortly.

411
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,280
到哪儿
Where?

412
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,920
你们的新家
Your new home.

413
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,420
战舰已经到了
The hive ship has just arrived.

414
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,580
等等
Wait.

415
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,980
我有个提议
I have a proposition for you.

416
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,650
你要干什么  塞法里斯
What are you doing, sefaris?

417
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,680
有些事很早前我们就该做了
Something we should have done a long time ago.

418
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,150
你没什么我想要的
There is nothing you have to offer me.

419
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:51,020
别那么肯定
Don't be so sure.

420
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,350
村子里藏着个人
There's someone hiding in the village.

421
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:55,620
他比我们所有人的价值都大
He's of far greater value than all of us put together.

422
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,080
塞法里斯  不行...
Sefaris, no--

423
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,220
放了我们  我就带你去
Spare our lives, I'll take you to him.

424
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,050
提议不错
A fair attempt...

425
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:06,250
但我的答案是  不
But the answer's no.

426
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,950
那就放了我
My life, then.

427
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,480
你怎么能这么做
How could you do this?

428
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,680
我保证  你们的等待绝对值得
I promise, it'll be worth your while.

429
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,780
我想所有人都在这儿了
I believe that is everybody.

430
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,220
麦凯和贝克特在哪里
Where's mckay and beckett?

431
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,420
罗德尼  你那边情况怎么样
Rodney, what's your status?

432
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,220
还在医务室
Still at the clinic.

433
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,580
卡森决定再带点东西
Carson decided to pick up a few more supplies.

434
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,020
叫他快点
Tell him to get a move on.

435
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,220
我们不能待很久
We can't stay here forever.

436
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,450
中校  你们先走
Go ahead, colonel.

437
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:33,480
我们会追上来的
We'll catch up.

438
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,750
你肯定?
You sure?

439
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,720
绝对肯定  我们就跟在你们后面
Absolutely. we'll be right behind you.

440
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,780
我们出发
Let's get going.

441
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:41,280
跟紧了  沿着路走
Stay together. follow the tracks.

442
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,480
那儿  那应该行
There. that should do it.

443
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,450
罗德尼  能不能帮个忙
Rodney, can you give me a hand here?

444
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:55,620
记得提醒我  下次来的时候带个夏尔巴人
Remind me to bring a sherpa next time I visit.

445
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,280
他
Him.

446
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,280
他就是那个人
He's the one.

447
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,920
你瞧
You see?

448
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,980
我遵守了我的约定
I kept up my end of the bargain.

449
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,850
的确
So you did.

450
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,580
但很不幸
Unfortunately,

451
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,920
基于你的
In light of your...

452
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,750
情况
"condition"...

453
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:25,780
留你活口太危险了
Keeping you alive is far too risky.

454
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,480
幽灵战斗机
Darts.

455
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,450
罗德尼和卡森还没来
Rodney and carson are still not here.

456
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,120
罗德尼  请回话
Rodney, come in.

457
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,120
麦凯
Mckay?

458
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,320
你们继续走
You guys keep moving.

459
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,220
我回去接应他
I'm going to go get him.

460
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,720
若楠  泰勒
Ronon? teyla?

461
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,950
请说
Go ahead.

462
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:29,480
幽灵人抓了贝克特和麦凯
The wraith just got beckett and mckay.

463
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,650
什么  怎么会
What? how?

464
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:31,980
他们被带到幽灵战斗机上
Took 'em up in a dart.

465
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:34,380
我想他们是要被送到战舰上
I think they're on their way up to a hive.

466
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,350
幽灵是怎么知道他们在村里的
How did the wraith know that they were in the village?

467
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,780
我想我有点头绪
I think I got an idea.

468
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,280
罗德尼
Rodney.

469
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,720
罗德尼  醒醒
Rodney, wake up.

470
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,320
我的上帝  这是我么
Oh... god, is it me,

471
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,280
还是他们的电晕武器加了电量
Or have they juiced up the stun weapons?

472
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,720
他们还把我们带到了战舰上
Oh, and they brought us to the hive.

473
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,980
真是太好了
That's great.

474
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,280
我们怎么办
What are we going to do?

475
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,180
别  别惊慌
Uh, just don't-- don't panic.

476
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,350
别惊慌
Don't panic.

477
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,050
我对逃离这种地方很有经验
I have... got lots of experience escaping from these things.

478
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:14,080
你?
You do?

479
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,450
是啊
Oh, yeah. yeah.

480
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:16,420
这种情况  我碰到过几十次了
I've been in this situation dozens of times,

481
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,420
总能找到出去的方法
Always figured a way out.

482
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,420
具体怎么办
How, exactly?

483
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,880
让我想想
Uh, let's see.

484
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,450
上一次  泰勒冒充女皇  所以...
Last time, teyla was posing as a queen, so...

485
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:26,320
然后  她把我们放了
You know, she had us released.

486
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,050
这次不太可能
Not much chance of that happening.

487
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:29,220
我猜也不行
No, I guess not.

488
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,550
那再上次呢
How about the time before that?

489
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:32,150
若楠的朋友泰尔假装成
Ronon's friend tyre was pretending to be

490
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,150
幽灵人的同盟军
In league with the wraith,

491
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:34,750
但事实上他是我们这边的  所以...
But really he was on our side, so...

492
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,180
他放了我们
He let us out.

493
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,850
我想我看出规律了
I'm starting to sense a pattern here.

494
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:39,180
事实上  你从来没有
You've actually never really

495
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,680
靠自己逃出这种监狱过
Escaped from one of these cells on your own?

496
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,850
凡事都有第一次
First time for everything, right?

497
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:44,450
我的上帝  罗德尼
Oh, god, rodney.

498
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:45,750
好了  给我一分钟
Well, just... give me a minute.

499
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,450
让我想想怎么办
I'll think of something.

500
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:48,880
我不想给你压力  罗德尼
I hate to pressure you, rodney,

501
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,480
但我想我们连一分钟都没了
But I don't think we have a minute.

502
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,550
把他们带出来
Bring them.

503
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,780
这是什么地方
What is this place?

504
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:10,780
我的顶级科学家用的实验室
A lab belonging to my top scientist.

505
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,720
过去6个月他一直在研究
For the last six months he has been studying

506
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,180
渗入到
The deadly toxin

507
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:18,780
我们食物中的剧毒
That has infiltrated our food supply.

508
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:21,780
他现在人呢
Where is he now?

509
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,350
死了
Dead.

510
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:26,320
他确信
He was convinced

511
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,880
自己找到了一种安全可行的方法
He had arrived at a foolproof way

512
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,450
来检测毒药
To detect the poison.

513
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,920
为了证明这点
To prove it, he decided

514
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,350
他决定以身试药
To feed on one of his test subjects.

515
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,820
我猜结果没用
Guess that didn't work out so well?

516
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:39,850
他在痛苦中死去
He died in excruciating pain.

517
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:41,620
更不用说
Needless to say,

518
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:45,520
他的研究就此止步
His research has been stalled ever since.

519
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,320
所以你们才会在这儿
And that's where you come in,

520
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,620
医生
Doctor.

521
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,520
我?
Me?

522
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,580
你想让我干嘛
What do you expect me to do?

523
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,120
指认你的人说
The one who identified you said

524
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,950
你在处理毒药方面经验颇丰
You had considerable expertise in dealing with the toxin.

525
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:02,420
他甚至说你有参与研究它
He even said you had a hand in developing it.

526
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,150
如果有谁能找到
If anyone can find

527
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:06,650
检测毒药的方法  那就是你
A way to detect it, you can.

528
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:07,950
如果你觉得我能帮到你
If you think I'm going to help you,

529
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,580
你就大错特错了
You're sorely mistaken.

530
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,320
我预测到你会这么说
I anticipated you might say that,

531
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,680
所以我为你准备了
Which is why I'm prepared

532
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,850
一点奖励
To offer you an incentive.

533
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:18,420
目前为止
Thus far,

534
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:22,120
我决定放过下面星球上的人们
I have spared the lives of the people on the planet below.

535
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:25,450
如果你合作  我就继续这么做
If you cooperate, I will continue to do so.

536
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:29,280
如果你们任何一个惹火我
But if either of you try to cross me in any way--

537
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,720
好好好  我们明白了
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we get the picture.

538
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,780
我就知道你们会明白的
I knew you'd come to see it my way.

539
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:42,150
开始吧
Get to work.

540
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:57,950
给我个不打爆你头的理由
Give me one reason why I shouldn't Blow your head off.

541
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:58,950
为什么
What for?

542
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:01,380
幽灵人怎么会去抓贝克特的
How did the wraith know to grab beckett?

543
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,550
你什么意思
W-what do you mean?

544
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:03,520
医生被抓了?
Doctor's been captured?

545
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:08,820
我发誓  和我没关系
I swear, I had nothing to do with that.

546
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:09,920
那你的人呢
What about your men?

547
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,920
也没有
No.

548
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,420
绝不可能
No, there's no way.

549
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,320
医生对我们一向很好
The doctor has been nothing but good to us.

550
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,350
他们不可能是碰巧去医务室的
Well, they didn't just stumble across the clinic.

551
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,550
一定有人带他们过去
Somebody brought them there.

552
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:23,280
你为什么不问问巴拉人
Well, why don't you ask the balarans?

553
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,220
他们最有利益可图
They're the ones with the most to gain.

554
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,350
他们中可能有人觉得
One of them probably thought

555
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:31,120
交出医生能换自己一命
He could save himself by turning in the doctor.

556
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:39,020
我告诉过你他们不是好人  中校
I told you they were no good, colonel.

557
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,820
该死
Damn it.

558
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,520
这些仪器没一个能连上
None of these consoles are hooked into anything.

559
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,180
我没法进入任何一个飞船系统
I can't access any of the ship's systems.

560
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,350
你呢
What about you?

561
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,450
有没有什么进展
You making any progress?

562
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:00,420
卡森
Carson?

563
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,080
你还好吧
You okay?

564
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,050
我办不到  罗德尼
I can't do this, rodney.

565
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:06,420
什么意思
What do you mean?

566
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,720
还没明白吗
You don't understand it?

567
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,250
不是  我是说  我做不到
No. I mean, I can't do it.

568
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,850
要是幽灵人找到检测hoffan药的方法
Do you realize what'll happen

569
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:13,280
你知道会有什么后果吗
If the wraith find a way to detect the hoffan drug?

570
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,420
他们会将整个银河系里
They'll hunt down

571
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,380
带毒的人全部歼灭殆尽
Every last person in this galaxy that has it.

572
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,750
那可是成千上万的人啊  罗德尼
That's hundreds of thousands of people, rodney.

573
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,950
更不用说当他们杀完后
Not to mention the fact that, when they're finished,

574
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:24,020
就会随心所欲地四处捕食
They can start feeding again, indiscriminately.

575
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,250
还有其它选择吗
What's the alternative, huh?

576
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,380
我们都知道幽灵人
We know the wraith

577
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,720
是不会就此罢休的
Aren't just going to let the matter drop.

578
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,180
我们都见识过他们的行径
We've seen what they can do.

579
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,620
他们会彻底摧毁整个村庄
They'll-- they'll wipe out entire villages

580
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,620
只是为了抓到几个巴拉星人
Just to get a few like the balarans.

581
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,320
那我要怎么做
So what am I supposed to do?

582
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,850
拖延时间就行了
You just stall.

583
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:37,750
假装你在干活
You know, you make it look like you're working, and...

584
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,680
直到我们找到逃跑的办法
Till we figure out how to get the hell out of here.

585
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,850
之后呢  继续做我们的事
And then what? go about our business?

586
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:42,080
假装一切从来没发生过吗
Pretend this never happened?

587
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,680
我没说这件事很容易
I never said it was going to be easy.

588
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,250
你不可能把银河系的所有问题
But you can't solve all the galaxy's problems

589
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:46,280
在一天内解决
In one day.

590
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,620
听着  我理解
Look, I understand.

591
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,150
你有罪恶感
You feel guilty.

592
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,580
但这不是你的错
But this is not your fault.

593
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,380
你又不知道事情会这样
You had no idea that any of this was going to happen.

594
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:56,220
医学院里老师教我们的第一件事
One of the first things they taught us in medical school

595
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,520
就是"不要害人"
Was "do no harm."

596
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,850
这种情况下我都不知道怎么做
Now, I'm at a loss right now

597
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:03,550
才能算是不去害人
To figure out how that's even possible in this situation.

598
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,820
他们怎么样了
How are they doing?

599
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,520
惊吓过度
They are frightened.

600
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,180
我一直试着让他们放心
I've been trying to reassure them,

601
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,420
不过没什么用
But it is of little use.

602
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,620
情况怎么样
How's it going in here?

603
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:23,980
勉强应付
We are getting by.

604
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,450
村里发生什么事了
What is happening in the village?

605
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:27,950
没啥  人人都躲在家里
Ah, not much. everybody's hiding indoors.

606
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:29,580
蜂巢战舰为啥还没开始进攻
Why hasn't the hive ship attacked yet?

607
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,320
你觉得这跟罗德尼和卡森的被俘
Do you think it could have something to do

608
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,980
有什么关系么
With rodney and carson's capture?

609
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,420
不清楚
I don't know,

610
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,180
不过我们应该利用现在的时间定个计划
But we should use this time to come up with a plan.

611
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,020
你有主意了?
You got anything?

612
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:40,380
算是吧  但是得费点事
Maybe, but it's going to take some work.

613
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,880
那是啥  发现什么了吗
What is it? you got something?

614
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,020
没有
No.

615
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,220
你确定
You sure?

616
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:54,180
你的脸上又浮现了"贝克特式"经典表情
You got one of those "beckett" faces.

617
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,180
有吗  真没啥  罗德尼
Aye, I'm sure, rodney.

618
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,180
回去做事吧
Just go back to work.

619
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,180
你去哪儿
Where are you going?

620
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,180
跟蜂巢战舰指挥官谈谈
To talk to the hive commander.

621
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:58,920
什么
What?

622
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,250
为什么
Why?

623
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:01,450
有点事得和他说下
There's something I need to tell him.

624
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:02,850
明白了  你发现什么了  到底是什么
Oh, I knew it. you found something. what is it?

625
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,050
开门
Hey, open up!

626
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:05,520
说真的  能告诉我吗
Seriously, will you just tell me?

627
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,250
你知道一旦你离开
You know I'm going to go through your stuff

628
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,250
我就会查看你的东西的
As soon as you're gone.

629
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,850
别管我了  罗德尼  开门
Just leave me be, rodney. open the door!

630
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:10,650
告诉我怎么回事不行吗
Will you just tell me what's going on?

631
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:13,880
我得马上跟指挥官谈谈
I need to talk to the commander right away.

632
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,580
听着  罗德尼  我要你待在这
Listen to me, rodney. I need you to stay here.

633
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,750
别担心
Don't worry.

634
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:17,720
不会有事的
Everything will be just fine.

635
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,680
走吧
Right.

636
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,720
医生
Doctor.

637
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,280
没想到那么快就有消息了
I didn't expect to hear from you so soon.

638
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,920
一定是好事吧
This must be good news.

639
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,450
对有些人来说  可能是的
For some people, maybe.

640
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:46,920
我来是告诉你我不干了
I'm here to tell you that I'm off the case.

641
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,650
你说什么
What are you talking about?

642
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:52,380
我不会再为你做那些龌龊的事了
I'm not going to do your dirty work for you.

643
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,750
另请高明吧
Find someone else.

644
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,150
没人可以代替你
There is no one else!

645
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,420
那只能算你运气不好啦
Then that's too bad for you, isn't it?

646
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:59,250
你在试探我的耐心  医生
You're trying my patience, doctor.

647
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:00,450
别忘了
You forget,

648
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:02,880
我手里握着下面那些人的性命
I control the fate of the people below.

649
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,880
无论我怎么做他们都会死的
People will die no matter what I do,

650
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,020
所以我什么都不会做
So I'm not going to do anything.

651
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:13,320
如果你拒绝完成这次研究
If you refuse to complete the research,

652
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,580
那你对我来说
Then there is only one other way

653
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,720
就只有另外一种用途了
That you could be of use to me.

654
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,280
相信我
And, trust me,

655
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,120
你不会喜欢的
You won't like it.

656
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,680
别再吓唬我了
You don't scare me anymore.

657
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,250
还不明白吗
Do you understand?

658
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:29,150
你怎么做都没用
I don't give a damn what you do to me.

659
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:31,380
随便你
Suit yourself.

660
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:35,320
我会非常享受的
I'm going to enjoy this... very much.

661
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:54,220
这是什么
What is this?

662
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:59,590
你对我做了什么
What have you done to me?

663
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,250
想不到你们距离检测出hoffan药
Turns out you were closer

664
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:04,020
只有一步之遥了
To detecting the hoffan drug than you thought.

665
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,520
完善你们的血液测试并没有花费多大功夫
It didn't take me long to perfect your blood test.

666
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,990
用你们提供的样品
And once I confirmed it

667
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:10,390
确认完以后
Using samples that you provided,

668
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:11,920
我决定拿我自己再做一次试验
I decided to do one more test,

669
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:16,190
以便万无一失
Just to be certain... on me.

670
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:18,190
你有毒素
You have the toxin?

671
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,890
说对了
Indeed.

672
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:23,520
现在  你也有了
And now... so do you.

673
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:44,520
卡森
Carson!

674
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,690
罗德尼
Hello, rodney.

675
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:46,950
你能删了那些数据吗
Can you delete this data?

676
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,390
当然  不过你怎么
Yeah, of course, but how did you--

677
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:49,720
我引诱指挥官吸食我
I talked the hive commander into feeding on me.

678
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,990
什么  什么
What? what?

679
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:51,850
为什么那么做
Why would you do that?

680
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,390
我有hoffan药  罗德尼
I have the hoffan drug, rodney.

681
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:55,520
一定是在和幽灵人作战的时候迈克尔给我的
Michael must have given it to me as a defense against the wraith.

682
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,720
为什么你没告诉我
Well, why didn't you tell me?

683
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,320
因为你会阻止我的
Because you would have stopped me from going.

684
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,590
是  因为那么做太蠢了
Yeah, because it's stupid!

685
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:00,350
要是你错了怎么办
What would've happened if you were wrong?

686
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,690
我得做点什么
I had to do something.

687
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:02,890
这是我们逃走的唯一机会
It's the only chance we had to get away.

688
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:04,120
现在你能在他们发现之前
Now, will you help me destroy this research

689
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,490
毁了这些研究资料吗
Before they find out what I've done?

690
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:06,520
可以
Right.

691
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,050
太棒了
Okay, great.

692
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:15,720
此路安全
The coast is clear.

693
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,450
我们到底在干嘛
What are we doing, exactly?

694
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:18,490
你说呢
What do you think?

695
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:20,120
我们在找飞船的出口
We're looking for a way off this ship.

696
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,820
就在走廊里漫无目的地晃悠?
By wandering aimlessly through the hallways?

697
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,390
我不是漫无目的地晃悠
I'm not wandering aimlessly.

698
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:25,590
我是在探索
I'm exploring.

699
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:28,390
两者差别很大的
There's a big difference.

700
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:33,750
找到了
Bingo!

701
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:43,320
你干什么呢  罗德尼
What are you doing, rodney?

702
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,120
侵入飞船的通讯系统
Hacking into the ship's communications.

703
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,320
你确定这么做好吗
Are you sure that's a good idea?

704
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,020
听着  要是不先联系上谢帕德
Look, if we don't get in touch with sheppard,

705
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:51,390
我们就别想离开飞船
We don't stand any chance of getting off this ship.

706
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:53,020
你得掩护我
You're going to have to cover me.

707
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,190
对
All right.

708
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:55,720
从哪个方向
From which direction?

709
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,550
那是什么
What was that?

710
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,450
谢帕德  听到了吗
Sheppard, do you read me?

711
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:01,950
麦凯  是你吗
Mckay, is that you?

712
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:03,650
谢天谢地
Oh! thank god!

713
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:05,850
我们在蜂巢战舰上  和贝克特一起
Okay, we are on the hive ship. I've got beckett with me.

714
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:07,690
到底怎么了
What the hell is going on up there?

715
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:10,190
我们试着逃跑
We managed to escape.

716
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:11,650
贝克特帮了大忙
Beckett helped.

717
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:12,890
太好了
Oh, that's great,

718
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:14,020
终于有救兵了
'cause we could really use the help.

719
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,350
你
You?

720
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,050
被困在船上的是我们
Look, we're the ones stuck on the ship!

721
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:18,750
现在需要你们在飞船上
That's exactly where you need to be right now,

722
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:19,850
因为我们需要有人
Because we need someone

723
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:21,750
除去蜂巢战舰的主要武器
To take out the hive's main weapons.

724
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:22,890
什么
What?

725
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:24,090
我们做了个计划
We got a plan,

726
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:25,350
不过只有先把蜂巢战舰搞垮
But it's only going to work

727
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,720
计划才能实施
If we take the hive out of the picture.

728
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,250
侵入通讯系统就已经够糟的了
It is bad enough that I hacked into communications!

729
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,620
要是再闯进别的系统
If I start messing around with other systems,

730
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,490
他们肯定会在几分钟内找到我们的
They'll track us down in a matter of minutes!

731
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:33,850
罗德尼  这是救其他人的
Rodney, it's the only way

732
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:35,520
唯一办法
To get these people to safety.

733
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,850
一旦结束
Once that's done,

734
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:38,520
我们就会想办法去救你们
We'll figure out a way to get you guys out of there.

735
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:43,990
好吧
All right.

736
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:45,950
看看我能做什么  给我几分钟的时间
I'll see what I can do. give me a few minutes.

737
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:47,090
应该就够了
That should be enough time.

738
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,350
你真是个好人  罗德尼
You're a good man, rodney.

739
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,520
是啊  是啊
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

740
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,590
别忘了我们就行了
Just don't forget us, okay?

741
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,750
不会的  祝你们好运
We won't. good luck.

742
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,050
你觉得他能搞定吗
Think he'll be able to pull it off?

743
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:55,350
最好能
Well, he'd better.

744
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:58,890
否则  事情就会变得非常糟了
Otherwise this thing's going to go very badly.

745
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,090
杰维斯
Jervis.

746
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:28,490
杰维斯
Jervis.

747
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:29,850
想干嘛
What do you want?

748
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:31,020
我们得谈谈
We need to talk.

749
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:33,420
和你没什么好谈的
Well, I have nothing to say to you.

750
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:36,050
你一直都是对的
You were right all along.

751
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:38,820
我应该听你的
I should have listened to you.

752
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:42,190
亚特兰蒂斯人根本不知道他们在干嘛
The atlantians have no idea what they're doing.

753
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:44,190
他们说是已经有了计划  实际上
They claim to have a plan, but, in reality,

754
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,390
只是拿我们的性命
They're just putting

755
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,090
去冒险
All our lives at risk.

756
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:56,250
现在有点太迟了  不是吗
It's a little late now, isn't it?

757
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,790
不一定
Is it?

758
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:02,090
如果你现在去星门那儿找幽灵人
If you went to the wraith at the gate right now,

759
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:05,520
你觉得他们会遵守原先的承诺吗
Do you think you could get them to honor the original deal?

760
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,790
有可能的
It's possible.

761
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:09,590
但是
But...

762
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,020
我得立刻交出
I'd have to deliver

763
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:13,320
剩下的所有外来者
All of the remaining outsiders at once.

764
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,520
他们在矿山里
They're in the mine,

765
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,350
藏在主室
Hiding in the main chamber.

766
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:23,050
其他村里的议员也同意吗
Are the other councilors on board with this?

767
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:24,720
他们知道得越少越好
The less they know about it, the better.

768
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,950
你呢
And you?

769
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:31,790
你对得起你的良心吗
Can you reconcile this with your conscience?

770
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:35,520
这不用你担心
Leave that to me.

771
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:38,890
你搞定交易就好
You just make that deal.

772
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,190
怎么回事
What is it?

773
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:11,590
搜索飞船
Search the ship.

774
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:14,420
这得花多久  罗德尼
How long is this going to take, rodney?

775
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,790
你在做手术时
Do I rush you

776
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:17,090
我有催过你么
While you're performing complicated surgery?

777
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:18,620
我知道你会催的
Aye, it's been known to happen.

778
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,320
好了  搞定了
All right, I'm in.

779
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,850
现在给我几分钟时间来解除
Now, I just need a few minutes to disable the--

780
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:26,650
老天哪
Oh, geez!

781
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:28,090
我们被发现了
I think they found us!

782
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:29,520
你说呢
You figure?

783
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,050
你得把他们牵制住
Okay, you're going to have to hold them off.

784
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:32,320
我?  现在?
Am i, now?

785
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,250
就是你  上吧
Yeah. come on, carson.

786
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:34,790
你能行的  好吧
You can do this, all right?

787
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:36,450
好吧  我数到三
All right. on three?

788
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:37,750
数到一就好了
How about on one?

789
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:38,820
好吧  好吧
All right. right.

790
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,190
一
And, one!

791
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,050
怎么样了
How's it coming?

792
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,750
差不多了
Almost there.

793
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,120
我不能一直拖住他们  罗德尼
I can't hold them off forever, rodney!

794
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:59,050
我们得走了  立刻
We have to go! now!

795
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:00,750
好了  搞定了  走吧走吧
All right, that's it! I got it! let's go!

796
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:07,590
我们去哪儿
Where are we going?

797
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:08,590
战机停靠处
The dart bay.

798
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:09,590
你知道怎么开幽灵战斗机
You know how to fly a dart?

799
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:10,550
我以前开过飞船
Well, I've flown jumpers before.

800
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:11,690
我去过东京
I've been to tokyo before.

801
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:13,050
并不意味着我会说日语啊
Doesn't mean I can speak japanese.

802
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:14,020
能有多难啊
Well, how hard can it be?

803
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:17,850
你到底知不知道自己去哪儿
Do you even know where you're going?

804
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:19,090
知道啊  我从控制台
Yeah, I pulled up

805
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:20,520
扯了张飞船示意图
A schematic of the ship on that console.

806
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,390
什么  在我们被袭击的时候?
What? while we were being fired upon?

807
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:30,490
好了  锁上了
All right, that's sealed.

808
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:31,990
这能拖住他们多久
How long do you think it'll hold them?

809
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,720
不太久
Not very.

810
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,020
来吧
Well, come on.

811
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,590
你在干什么
What are you doing?

812
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:49,750
挤进来
I'm getting in.

813
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,390
容不下我们两个的
Well, we can't both fit in here.

814
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:53,120
一点没错  往旁边去点
You're damn right I can. now shove over!

815
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:56,250
你很舒服吧
You comfy?

816
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:58,550
爽呆了
Peachy.

817
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,450
你还在等什么
What are you waiting for?

818
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:02,350
应该起飞了啊
Well, it should just start up.

819
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:03,550
它怎么没反应
Well, it didn't.

820
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:04,690
我知道  这不对啊
I know, but it doesn't make sense.

821
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:06,220
我们头顶应该形成顶篷
A canopy should form over our head.

822
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,420
难到还有重量限制
Maybe there's some kind of a weight limit?

823
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,690
这是什么意思
What's that supposed to mean?

824
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:10,720
我是说这儿多了个人
I mean because there's two of us!

825
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,420
可能要用钥匙什么的
Well, maybe you need a key, or something?

826
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:14,250
这可不是大众汽车
It's not a volkswagen, carson!

827
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:15,850
听着
Okay, look,

828
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:17,290
显然是飞船操作系统
These are obviously the flight controls.

829
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:18,990
推进飞船前进
That makes that propulsion, so...

830
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:20,550
如此绝妙的结论哪儿来的
Where'd you come up with that brilliant conclusion?

831
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,920
这是常识
It's just common sense!

832
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,650
给点反应
Come on!

833
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:24,990
是啊  常识而已
Right, common sense.

834
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:26,120
我能怎么样
What do you want from me?

835
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,450
上面又没贴标签
It's not like there's labels!

836
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:29,850
大事不妙了
Oh, not good!

837
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:30,850
一点没错
You're telling me.

838
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:32,050
重想个计划  罗德尼
We need a new plan, rodney.

839
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:32,850
我当然知道  我在想啊
I know! I'm thinking!

840
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:34,120
总之  快想
Well, whatever you do, think fast,

841
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,490
只要幽灵突破了这道门  我们就挂定了
Because if those wraith come through that door, we both dead

842
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:43,720
罗德尼  我们得走了
Rodney, we need to go.

843
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,720
去哪儿  我们被困住了
Where? I mean, we're trapped in here!

844
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,160
那也得找个地方藏身啊
Then we need to find a place to hide.

845
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,290
快点
Come on.

846
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:49,320
怎么了
What?

847
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,720
我有主意了
I have another idea.

848
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,260
成功机会渺茫  但总得试试
It's a long shot, but it might work.

849
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:55,860
你得先从我身边挪开
But you're going to have to get off me!

850
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,520
一旦你带上他们
Once you've taken these people,

851
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,560
就会离开村庄  对吧
You're going to leave the village, right?

852
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,060
永远的
For good?

853
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:16,920
这个地方对我们没有意义
This place is of no concern to us.

854
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,160
我们只想得到巴拉人
All we want is the balarans.

855
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,860
前面有个大房间
There's a large chamber up ahead.

856
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:23,520
他们就藏在那里
That's where they're hiding.

857
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:29,760
他们在哪
Where are they?

858
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,620
我也不知道
I don't understand.

859
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:34,320
他说他们在这儿的
He said they were here!

860
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,320
我...他们应该就在这儿
I... they should be right here!

861
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:59,020
这是什么
What is this?

862
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:08,260
杀了这么多幽灵
Think we killed enough wraith

863
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,690
有用么
To make a difference?

864
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:12,190
走着瞧
Guess we'll find out.

865
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:17,590
干得漂亮
Nice work.

866
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,520
我们收到消息
We've received word

867
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,190
地面上发生爆炸
Of an explosion on the planet

868
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:33,960
我们不少战士因此丧生
That's killed several of our warriors.

869
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,520
人类不断袭击我们的部队
The humans continue to attack our troops.

870
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,220
他们要逃跑
They're trying to escape.

871
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,190
瞄准星门附近的地区
Target the area around the portal

872
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:41,360
开火
And open fire.

873
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,720
武器没反应
Weapons aren't responding!

874
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,720
什么
What?

875
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,420
拨号星门
Dial the gate.

876
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:05,620
这只是先遣部队  还会有更多
This is the first group. there are more are coming.

877
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,190
快点行动
We've got to move fast.

878
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:08,520
他们可不会中途躺下休息
They won't take this lying down.

879
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,560
出发
Let's go.

880
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,720
好的  来吧  出发
All right. come on, let's go.

881
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,720
弯腰  低一点
Stay low, stay low.

882
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,820
我们和把守星门的部队失去联系了
We've lost contact with the troops at the gate.

883
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:26,590
那两个人类囚犯呢
What about the two human prisoners?

884
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,420
不见了
They're nowhere to be seen.

885
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:31,090
他们不可能就这么消失了
They couldn't have just disappeared.

886
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:33,260
不过没关系
It doesn't matter.

887
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:36,590
不能让村民逃了
We can't let the villagers escape.

888
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:39,160
启动飞船
Launch the darts.

889
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:46,260
中校
Colonel!

890
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:48,760
快走  快走
Go, go, go!

891
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,690
该死的
Oh, crap!

892
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:08,860
谢帕德  又有人来了
Sheppard! we've got more coming!

893
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:14,820
快点  就快到了
Go, go, go! you're almost there.

894
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:19,990
泰勒
Teyla!

895
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:23,620
罗德尼  卡森
Rodney! carson!

896
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:24,690
老天哪  成功了
Oh, my god, it worked!

897
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:25,990
你简直是天才
Rodney, you're a genius!

898
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:27,260
你做了什么
What'd you do?

899
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:29,120
我重新设定了选择性电波使我们消失
I reprogrammed the culling beam to dematerialize us,

900
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,460
然后使其仅在一点释放
Then to discharge only from that point on.

901
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:32,590
一旦幽灵失去了他们的主武器
Once the wraith lost their main weapons,

902
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,990
启动飞船只是时间的问题
It was just a matter of time for them to launch the darts.

903
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:40,190
出发
Let's go!

904
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,560
你终于出现了
There you are!

905
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,760
我一直在呼叫你
I've been calling you.

906
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,460
对不起  什么事
Oh, I'm sorry. what's up?

907
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:56,290
罗恩他们为村民找到了一个
Lorne's team just found a suitable planet

908
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:57,490
合适的星球
For the villagers.

909
00:41:57,490 --> 00:41:58,920
他们下午就搬过去了
They're going to move them out this afternoon.

910
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,360
我听说了  我和他们一起走
Aye, I heard. I'm going with them.

911
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,620
是啊  当然
Oh, right.Of course.

912
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:03,590
要不要一起吃顿午饭
Um, well, you want to... grab some lunch?

913
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:05,060
我们还没时间唠唠嗑呢
We didn't get any chance to socialize this time around,

914
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,660
除非算上
Unless you count, you know,

915
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,560
在蜂巢战舰大厅转悠的时候
Running through the halls of the hive ship as social time.

916
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,590
是啊
Aye, you're right.

917
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:11,360
罗德尼  我很愿意
Look, rodney, I'd love to,

918
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,390
但我得先搞定这个
But I really need to get through this.

919
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:14,720
这是什么
Well, what is it?

920
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,060
凯勒医生关于血清的研究
Dr. keller's research on the serum

921
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,390
防止我的细胞持续恶化
That keeps my cells from deteriorating.

922
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:18,960
我想对那些在瘟疫中幸存下来的人
I think there might be something in here

923
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,590
可能有帮助
To help the plague survivors,

924
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:22,560
我已经不再感染了  而他们还在
Since I'm not getting the infections that they are.

925
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,790
你不用现在做啊
Well, you don't have to do this now.

926
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:25,420
要是我的话  会下到硬盘里
I'll download the data to a drive.

927
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:27,090
你带走就是了
You can just, you know, take it with you.

928
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:28,460
事实上不行
Actually, you can't.

929
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:31,060
伍尔希先生不想让数据离开基地
Mr. woolsey doesn't want it leaving the base.

930
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,320
对不起  罗德尼
I'm sorry, rodney.

931
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,420
没关系  我不在意
Well, I don't care.

932
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:35,820
只是想防止你总抱怨说
I was just, you know, trying to stop you

933
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,520
见不到我的人影
From whining about never seeing me.

934
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,890
好吧
All right.

935
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,920
罗德尼  等等
Rodney, wait.

936
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:44,290
现在我有点饿了
Now that I think of it, I am a wee bit peckish.

937
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:47,090
另外我也不可能把银河系的所有问题
Besides, I can't solve all the galaxy's problems

938
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:48,120
在一天内解决吧
In one day, can i?

939
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,660
那我
Well, i--

940
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:51,220
别说了
Shut it.

941
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:53,460
好了  走吧
Right, let's go.

942
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:54,790
那么
So?

943
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:57,460
最近有没有心上人
Interested in anyone these days?

944
00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:00,360
没有  没时间想那个
Me? no, I don't have time for that.

945
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,590
你真不会说谎  麦凯博士
You're a terrible liar, dr. mckay.

946
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:04,620
快说  快说
Tell me, tell me, tell me.
