It's only the other investors we have to worry about, all right?

42
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,380
你的任务
Your job is to keep calm

43
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,540
就是去安抚演员和工作人员  好吗
and reassure the cast and crew, all right?

44
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,320
道奇先生

52
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,850
她为何去914房吗
what she was doing up in room 914?

53
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,320
那块区域是我们这次演出用的化妆室
Well, we were using that area as a dressing room for this event.

54
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,150
她本应在下面的宴会大厅的

55
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,350
她第三个出场

我们让演员零零散散地

58
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:37,070
装扮成酒店客人  工作人员和餐厅服务员
dressed as hotel guests, workers, caterers.

59
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,890
开场是布兰的创意
It was Bran's idea to start the show.

60
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,300
对  一个客人突然出来唱歌
Yeah, a guest breaks out into song,

61
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,040
然后是侍者  再是女服务员

62
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,990
就是莎伦
That was Sharon.

63
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,820
她该呆在宴会大厅的
She was supposed to be in the ballroom.

64
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,050
你们帮了大忙
You've both been really helpful.

65

别跟我说你在医院

离开那儿
Get out of there.

81
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,960
如果杰森·列侬醒了
If Jason Lennon wakes up,

82
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,100
如果他开口了
and if he talks,

83
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,440
如果他知道血腥约翰的身份

00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,710
你这是在玩火
You're playing with fire.

88
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,810
还有更坏的呢
There are worse things to play with.

89
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,180

我们都清楚你为何来这儿
We both know why you're here.

98
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,710
不过我很好奇为什么你急着要和列侬谈话
Although I find your need to talk to Lennon now interesting.

99
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:00,790

You did stand by while Lorelei Martins shot him.

100

但是我觉得你应该离开了

00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:14,550
不用介绍了  我在电梯里过了一遍
No need. I just caught up in the elevator.

147
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:18,250
道奇  麦克塔维什  克莱尔
Uh, Dodge, McTavish, and Clare,

148
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,520
制片人  导演  公关
producer, director, publicist.

149
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,100
莎伦和其他演员或工作人员有什么矛盾吗
Was Sharon having any trouble with the, uh, cast or crew?

150
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,350
不  不  一点也没有
No, no. Not at all.

151
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,470
我们《火炬》剧组是个大家庭
We're a very happy family here at "Torch."

152
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:30,330
当然了  一个好公关
Yes, of course. That's exactly what a good publicist

153
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,900
就应该这么说  对吧
should say, isn't it?

154
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,710
受害人坠楼时你在哪  克莱尔小姐
Uh, where were you when the victim fell, Ms. Clare?

155
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,800
我在宴会大厅
Oh, I was in the ballroom.

156
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,730
道奇先生  你为什么要让
Mr. Dodge, uh, what made you want

157
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,760
莎伦·沃里克演女二号
to cast Sharon Warwick as the second lead?

158
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,350
根据这上面来看  她没有多少戏剧经验
According to this, she doesn't have much theater experience.

159
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,420
她这段介绍挺短的
Her paragraph's very short.

160
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,120
莎伦从纽约来
Well, uh, Sharon came out here from New York,

161
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,780
她试镜的时候征服了布兰
and she just knocked Bran out with her audition.

162
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,310
我信任他的判断力
And, uh, I trust his judgment.

163
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,300
她是个天生的舞者  声音洪亮
She's a natural dancer, big voice,

164
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,910
学得快  急欲成长
quick learner, and she was hungry.

165
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:57,880
这就够了
That's all you need.

166
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,540
她有什么好处
Well, what was in it for her?

167
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,810
我是说  大材小用了
I mean, it's a revival in the sticks.

168
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:05,010
她在纽约已经是歌星了
She was already a well-known singer in New York.

169
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:08,210
她想尝试一些特别的东西
She wanted to be a part of something special.

170
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,710
确实如此  我们在萨克拉门托首映
Exactly. I mean, we're starting out here in Sacramento,

171
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,750
但是《火炬》六个月后就会登上百老汇
but "Torch" will be on Broadway in six months.

172
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,510
九个月后会成为托尼奖竞争者
And a Tony contender in nine.

173
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:18,140
演员们和当地人有什么接触吗
Did the cast have much contact with the locals?

174
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,630
不知道  我认为没有
Uh, I don't know. I don't-- I don't think so.

175
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,220
我觉得他们没有时间
Oh, I wouldn't think they'd have the time.

176
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,320
他们肯定马上开始彩排了
They would have been right into rehearsals straightaway.

177
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,460
-是的  很对  -好吧
- Yeah. That's right. - So, yeah.

178
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,870
那么你跟我想的一样
So you think like me.

179
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,300
凶手和你的音乐剧有关联
The killer is connected to your musical.

180
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,520
有什么想法吗
Any guesses?

181
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,620
没有  好吧  谢了
No? Okay. Thanks.

182
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,420
不好意思  他是谁
I'm sorry. Who is that?

183
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,290
他是个顾问
He's a consultant.

184
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,790
谢谢你们合作
Thank you for your time.

185
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,320
嫌疑人太多了
The suspect pool is huge.

186
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,740
这会跟噩梦一样
It's gonna be a nightmare.

187
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,640
怎么一开始就这么消极
Why start on such a pessimistic foot?

188
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,750
你为什么闷闷不乐的
Why are you so glum?

189
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,070
我给你打电话  你却在围着列侬转
I call you up, and you're creeping around Lennon,

190
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,860
试图插手柯克兰的工作
getting into Kirkland's business.

191
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,930
我当然闷闷不乐了
Of course I'm glum.

192
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,730
-因为这个啊  -是的  因为这个
- Oh, that. - Yeah. That.

193
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,750
劳拉蕾·马丁斯这事儿上我们已经颜面尽失了
We look bad enough after the whole Lorelei Martins mess.

194
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,750
列侬是找到血腥约翰的直接线索
Lennon is a direct link to Red John.

195
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,300
我得跟他谈谈
I need to talk to him.

196
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,210
你要学会守规矩
You need to try and start following the rules for a while.

197
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:13,750
如果你非要不按规矩办事
And if you must break the rules,

198
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,160
那就用你自己的时间
break them on your own time.

199
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,520
什么时候不是我自己的时间
When am I not on my own time?

200
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,750
格蕾斯
Grace.

201
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:35,930
见到你真高兴
It's so good to see you.

202
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,080
洛杉矶怎么样
How was L.A.?

203
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,970
学到不少好东西
I learned a lot of really great stuff,

204
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,810
但我不知道别人是怎么住在那的
but I don't know how anybody lives there.

205
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,000
能回家我很开心
I'm really happy to be home.

206
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,540
欢迎回来工作
Well, welcome back to the grindstone.

207
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,660
谢谢  这音乐怎么回事
Yeah. What's with the music?

208
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,940
我们的死者是名歌手
Our victim's a singer.

209
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,680
她被人从窗口推了下去
She was pushed out of a window.

210
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,990
挺上口的  是吧
It's kind of catchy, huh?

211
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:50,060
是网络热门歌曲
It was an Internet hit.

212
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,090
她来这主演音乐剧  结果被杀了
She comes out here to star in a musical and gets killed.

213
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:54,060
范佩尔  欢迎回来
Van Pelt! Welcome back.

214
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,000
谢了  头儿  回来真好
Thanks, boss. It's good to be back.

215
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,160
见到你真好
It's good to see you.

216
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,660
进展怎么样
How we doing so far?

217
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,890
挺好  发现了沃里克其实是本地人
Good. Found out that Warwick was actually a local.

218
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,640
真的吗  戏剧公司的人似乎
Really? The people from the theater company

219
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,120
觉得她是纽约来的
seemed to think she was from New York.

220
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,880
我跟一个叫波丽·戴迟的谈过了
No, I spoke to a Polly Datch.

221
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,890
她说她是沃里克在萨克拉门托的养母
Said she was Warwick's foster mother here in Sacramento.

222
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,120
她在来加调局的路上
She's on her way to CBI.

223
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,170
案发当晚沃里克的行程是什么
What about Warwick's timeline the night of the murder?

224
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:13,030
我已经和大概一半的演员谈过了
Wll, I've spoken to about half the cast so far.

225
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:15,050
坏消息是他们为了方便进出  没有锁上
Bad news is they were leaving the door to that room unlocked

226
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,000
那房间的门
for ease of access.

227
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,970
所以她死的时候  在场的可能是任何人
So anyone could have been in there when she died?

228
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,330
是的  好消息是我们有很多视频和照片
Yeah. The good news is we got a whole lot of video

229
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,850
来进行调查工作
and photos to work off.

230
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:24,230
演员在7点45分左右离开房间
So the cast left the room at around a quarter of 8:00

231
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,430
准备就位
to get into position.

232
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,920
沃里克当时还跟他们在一起
Warwick was with them.

233
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,700
她7点52分离开宴会大厅
She leaves the ballroom at 7:52.

234
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,340
8点01分坠落在轿车上
At 8:01, she hits the limo.

235
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,230
在这期间制片方
Was anyone else from production missing

236
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,820
-有没有人不见  -目前还不能确定
- during that period? - I can't tell just yet.

237
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,550
我会继续查
I'll keep digging.

238
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,240
在她坠楼后有人匆忙离开吗
Did anybody leave in a hurry after she fell?

239
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,950
有一个  迪安德拉·桑德兰  女主角
Yeah, one. Deandra Sunderland, the star.

240
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,060
演员中有传言
Now the rumor among the cast

241
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,700
她有酗酒的问题
is that she's got a drinking problem,

242
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,970
他们认为她很可能
so they think she's probably getting sauced

243
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,940
去酒店吧台喝酒了
in one of the, uh, hotel bars.

244
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,070
有酗酒问题的过气天后  真不寻常
A fading diva with a drinking problem? That's unusual.

245
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,890
-是啊  看看这个  -这是她离开的时候
- Yeah. Check this out. - This is her leaving.

246
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,000
什么时间
Well, when was that?

247
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,500
案发后半小时
About half-hour after the murder.

248
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,860
宾馆的监控录像呢
Uh, what about the surveillance footage from the hotel?

249
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,650
大厅和电梯有录像
Cameras in the lobby and all the elevators.

250
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:00,620
马上就送到
It's being sent over.

251
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,180
那那个投资商呢  汉诺威
What about the investor-- Hanover?

252
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:02,890
查到他什么了吗
Do you have anything on him?

253
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,790
演员说了他很多事情
Yeah, the cast had a lot to say about him, too.

254
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,450
他富得能买下特拉华州
Apparently he can buy Delaware.

255
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:09,470
在公关送来的录像中我们可以看到他到场
We also found his arrival in the party footage the publicist sent over.

256
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,550
我在网上查到了他
I looked him up on the Internet.

257
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,320
他是外汇交易员  喜欢艺术
He's a currency trader, and he likes the arts.

258
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,090
头儿  波丽·戴迟  死者的养母
Hey, boss, Polly Datch, victim's foster mom--

259
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,470
-想跟你谈谈  -好的
- wants to talk to you. - All right.

260
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:34,690
戴迟夫人  我是里斯本探员
Uh, Mrs. Datch? I'm Agent Lisbon.

261
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:38,650
你是莎伦·沃里克的养母吗
Uh, you were Sharon Warwick's foster parent?

262
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:41,280
-是的  警官  -多久了
- Yes, ma'am. - Uh, for how long?

263
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:44,430
莎伦来我家时十二岁
Sharon came to live with me when she was 12.

264
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:46,960
她不知道她的亲生父母
Never knew her biological parents.

265
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,860
我和我大多数的孩子都很亲密
I stay close with most of my kids,

266
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,800
但是 莎伦很特别
but Sharon was special.

267
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:55,160
这是你们要找的人
That's the man you need to find--

268
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,860
贝利·拉辛
Billy Racine.

269
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,380
他是什么人
Who is he?

270
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,530
他是个小混混
No-good thug, that's who.

271
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:01,780
他是她的前男友吗
Is he an ex-boyfriend?

272
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,820
那是她做的一个不明智的选择
He was her one bad choice.

273
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,350
你们回来后
Had she been in contact with Racine

274
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,190
她还有和拉辛联系吗
since you came back to town?

275
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,690
肯定有
I'm sure of it.

276
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:12,300
而且我觉得一周前他打了她
And I think he assaulted her a week ago.

277
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,490
你觉得
You think?

278
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,920
我不能说我知道  因为她不肯提这件事
I don't really know because she wouldn't talk about it.

279
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,950
她气坏了  说自己是被抢劫了
She bursted off, called it a botched mugging.

280
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,110
但我可以肯定就是他
But I'm certain it was him.

281
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,160
不然她为什么不报案
Why else wouldn't she report it?

282
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,600
他以前有对她动粗过吗
Had he been violent with her in the past?

283
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,460
莎伦说没有  但是...
Sharon said no, but...

284
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,850
我知道贝利·拉辛有暴力倾向
I know Billy Racine is a violent man.

285
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,240
当然
Sure.

286
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:40,970
当然  汉诺威先生  非常感谢
Of course, Mr. Hanover. Thank you for your time.

287
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,880
终于找到汉诺威了
Finally found Hanover?

288
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,550
是啊  他也没看到事发那一幕
Yeah. He didn't see the crash either,

289
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,840
但他说他回来以后
but he said he'd be happy to talk to us

290
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,090
很乐意和我们谈谈
when he gets back in town.

291
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,240
回来以后
Back in town?

292
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,520
他飞去参加一个艺术展开幕式了
He had to fly to an art opening.

293
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,070
有一件艺术品他志在必得
A piece he just had to have.

294
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:52,080
有钱人啊
Rich people.

295
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,910
你查到了什么
What'd you get?

296
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,660
里斯本从她的养母那里得来的
Lisbon got this from the foster mom.

297
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:57,190
贝利·拉辛  她的前男友
Name's Billy Racine. Ex-boyfriend.

298
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:00,000
她养母觉得是他做的
Foster mother thinks he could have done it.

299
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,210
这家伙劣迹斑斑啊
Guy's had a life.

300
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:02,840
多次涉嫌伤害  敲诈
Multiple assaults, extortion.

301
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,970
这名字听着耳熟
That name sounds familiar.

302
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:09,700
拉辛  威廉
"Racine. William."

303
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,500
他在演出募款晚宴的入场券
He's on the list of people who purchased tickets

304
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,120
购买者名单上
to the show's fund-raiser.

305
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,430
他去那里做什么
What was he doing there?

306
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,350
我看看能不能找到他
I'll see if I can track him down.

307
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:26,020
多谢
Thanks.

308
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,440
你两天前去《火炬》的募款晚宴
What were you doing at the fund-raiser for "Torch"

309
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,630
做什么
two nights ago?

310
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,670
支持艺术啊
Supporting the arts.

311
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:35,770
你那晚有和莎伦·沃里克联系吗
Did you have any contact with Sharon Warwick that evening?

312
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,030
要是有  有什么关系吗
If I did, what's it matter?

313
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,850
在她去纽约前你们两个有过
You two had quite the tempestuous relationship

314
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,610
一段相当糟糕的情侣关系
before she moved to New York.

315
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:44,770
激烈争吵  你还一拳把墙打穿了
Shouting matches. You even put your fist through a wall.

316
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,370
一个月前她回来的时候
Did you pick up where you left off

317
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:47,580
你是不是又故态复作了
when she came back a month ago?

318
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,780
别想把这盆脏水泼到我身上
Don't even try to pin this on me.

319
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,700
我知道发生了什么  我没杀她
I know what's happened, and I didn't kill her.

320
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,740
我为什么要相信你呢
Why should I believe you?

321
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,380
因为我是绝对不会伤害那个姑娘的
Because I would never put my hands on that girl.

322
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,470
我爱她
I loved her.

323
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,420
我觉得也许你爱她太多了
I think you loved her maybe too much.

324
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,340
她拒绝了你
She rejected you,

325
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,430
你不能容忍她的拒绝
you didn't take "No" for an answer,

326
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,410
你跟踪她到募款晚宴
you stalked her to the fund-raiser.

327
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:04,710
她再次拒绝了你
And when she rejected you again,

328
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:06,670
你就气不过出手杀了她
your hands got the better of you.

329
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,670
我是去保护她的
I went there to protect her.

330
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:11,600
保护她什么
Protect her from what?

331
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,510
她上周被抢劫了
She got mugged last week.

332
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,670
她反抗了
Said she fought 'em off

333
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,080
而且把其中一个抓伤了
and scratched one of them up pretty good,

334
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,420
但我看得出来她很害怕
but I could see she was shook.

335
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,210
这和募款晚宴有什么关系
What does that have to do with the fund-raiser?

336
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,520
莎伦觉得抢劫是剧组里的某个人设计的
Sharon thought someone from the show set it up.

337
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,070
所以我一听说她要去那个宴会
So when I heard they were doing that party...

338
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:27,850
你就去找袭击她的人
You went to find her attackers?

339
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,170
我本来是要教训一些人的
I was gonna tune some people up.

340
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:34,660
可莎伦说"别这样"  她能处理好
But Sharon said "Be easy." Said she'd handle it.

341
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,270
她有提过她怀疑谁吗
Did she say who she suspected?

342
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,700
她不肯说
She wouldn't say.

343
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,740
她害怕我会对那些人做出什么不好的事
She was scared I was gonna do something bad to 'em.

344
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,690
她是对的
And she was right.

345
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:44,100
你是说你们之间一切安好吗
So you're telling me everything was good between you two?

346
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:48,320
你和她养母谈过了  对吧
You've been talking to that old foster lady, huh?

347
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,480
她从来就不喜欢我
She never liked me.

348
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,790
你不能相信她的一面之辞
You can't believe what she says.

358
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,470
我们必须做好准备

This is a closed rehearsal.

375
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,670
我们在调查一起谋杀案
Yeah. We're investigating a murder.

376
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:10,660
那你们在这可找不到什么线索
Well, you won't find any clues here.

377
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:13,270
实际上  我们可以在观看排练中
Actually, we could learn a lot

378
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,480
获得很多信息
from watching a rehearsal.

379
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,990
真的吗
Oh, really?

380
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,540
是的  一个人唱歌的方式
Yes. The way a person sings

381
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,710
能反映出很多自身的内在
says a great deal about them.

382
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:22,900
比如说  布丽奇特  你的嗓音很甜美
For instance, Bridget, you have a very sweet tone.

383
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:23,850
谢谢
Thank you.

384
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:27,640
带着粉饰过的愤怒和嫉妒
Yes, with nice shades of pent-up anger and envy.

385
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,600
你应该是讨厌莎伦的
You hated Sharon on principle,

386
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,150
你可能就是来取代她的
yet you may come to replace her.

387
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:35,170
所以很明显  你有杀她的动机
So obviously, you had very good motive to want to kill her.

388
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:38,150
但我觉得你没有把她推下阳台的
But I don't think you have the stomach or the strength

389
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,630
勇气和力量
to push someone off a balcony.

390
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,860
你  曼迪  从一方面来说
You, Mandy, on the other hand,

391
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,220
你绝对有完成谋杀的能力
are perfectly capable of murder.

392
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,270
你手段很高
You have a very strong instrument.

393
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,880
你可以演莎伦的部分
You could play Sharon's part.

394
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,160
但你有没有到非杀她不可的地步呢
But are you hungry enough to kill?

395
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,650
你有那么盛怒吗
Do you have that kind of passion?

396
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,920
我不知道
I don't know.

397
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,570
别看我了  谢谢
Oh, don't even look at me. Thank you.

398
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:58,990

Oh, please. Pitchy.

399
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:01,280

Yes. Well, that leaves you, Mr. McTavish.

402
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,610
虚荣  控制狂  神经质  自大
Vain. Controlling. Neurotic. Egotistical.

403
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,530

Sleeping with, uh,

404
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:16,500
手下的两名演员上过床
at least two of your actors.

405
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,370
你是凶手吗
Are you a killer?

406
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:23,350
我还不知道你的名字呢
You know, I never did catch your name.

407
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,650
该死
Mm. Damn.

408
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:28,030
我还以为凶手是你来着
I was sure it was you.

409
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,550
算了  我叫简
Never mind. Name's Jane.

410
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,470
很高兴见到你们  祝你们演出成功
Nice to meet you all. Break a leg.

411
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:44,750
我觉得你们的歌声...非常动听
Well, I thought you sounded... great.

412
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,140
演员的情绪都被他影响了
He's upsetting the performers.

413
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,150
-我知道  我知道  -他会搞砸演出的
I know. I know. He's gonna throw their performances off.

414
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,740
-布兰  我会处理的  -好吧
- Bran, I'll take care of it. - All right.

415
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,360
可以吧
All right?

416
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,400
简先生
Mr. Jane.

417
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,040
拜托了  你在场影响了他们的情绪
Please. Your presence isn't good for morale.

418
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,050
大家的状态似乎还不错嘛
Everyone seems to be handling it okay.

419
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:18,620
问题也问完了  你还要待在这里吗
You've asked your questions. Is it necessary that you remain?

420
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,890
我们不会影响你们的
We'll stay out of your way.

421
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,290
你们都不会发现我们的存在
You'll hardly know we're here.

422
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,650
打扰一下  我和所有
Pardon me. Okay, so I've gotten confirmations

423
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,890
投资方确认过了
from all of our bigger investors.

424
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,480
他们都会出席改期的预演
They will all be at the rescheduled preview.

425
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,030
太好了  汉诺威呢
Excellent. And, uh, Hanover?

426
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,240
还需要再确认一下
Still need to double confirm.

427
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,320
很好  很好
Good. Good.

428
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,740
真是忙碌啊
Busy, busy.

429
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,790
确实
Indeed.

430
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:37,440
抱歉  我得接个电话
If you'll excuse me, I have to take this.

431
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,540
没问题
Sure.

432
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:54,010
打扰一下
Um... Excuse me.

433
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,120
抱歉打扰到你了
Sorry to bother you.

434
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,860
你知道爵士手势是什么吗
Uh, I was wondering if you knew what jazz hands were?

435
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:00,830
当然知道
Sure.

436
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,470
就是舞蹈编排中运用大幅度的手部动作
It's the use of big hand movements in choreography.

437
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:04,680
为什么这么问
Why do you ask?

438
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,170
我刚刚偶然听到导演在大吼
Oh, I just overheard the director

439
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:07,780
说什么爵士手势
ranting about jazz hands,

440
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,450
所以我就好奇到底是什么让他这么激动
so I was curious to know what got him so worked up.

441
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,880
他是怎么大吼的
Ranting how?

442
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,860
很显然  他非常非常讨厌爵士手势
Well apparently, he hate, hate, hates jazz hands.

443
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,520
而且一旦让他给看到爵士手势
And if he sees one jazzy little hand,

444
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,290
舞蹈演员就会被踢出表演
that dancer is out of the show.

445
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,660
很高兴知道这件事  谢谢
Oh. Good to know. Thanks.

446
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,480
别担心  你最好把这件事和
No worries. Uh, you might wanna pass that on

447
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,530
你后面那些姑娘说一下
to the girl that comes up after you.

448
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:27,090
祝你演出成功
Break a leg.

449
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,630
麦姬  到你了
Okay, Maggie, you're up.

450
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:37,460
我们到底为什么要在这里看试镜
So what exactly are we looking for with these auditions?

451
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,430
看到就知道了
We'll know when we see it.

452
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:41,460
你喜欢音乐剧吗
You like musicals?

453
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,000
没理由不喜欢啊
Oh, what's not to like?

454
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,460
她们表演得真好
They're so good.

455
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,850
还有多少人
How many more are there?

456
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:24,020
我也不清楚
I'm not sure.

457
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:27,470
有个捣蛋鬼应该马上就要露面了
A troublemaker should reveal herself very shortly.

458
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:01,060
不  不  不不不不不不不
No! No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

459
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,140
你在干什么  布丽奇特
What are you doing, Bridget?

460
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,280
怎么突然就变成了爱达荷的夜店风了
Suddenly we were in a cabaret bar in Idaho.

461
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,450
我以为你希望有大幅度的手部动作
I thought you wanted bigger hand movement.

462
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,250
谁告诉你的
What gave you that idea?

463
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:11,640
抱歉  不过  这可能是我造成的
Uh, I'm sorry, but this, uh, might indirectly be my doing.

464
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:15,050
我跟第一个舞者说
I told the first dancer that the director

465
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:19,700
导演会开除有大幅度手部动作的人
would fire anyone that added big hand movements.

466
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,190
什么
What?

467
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:23,920
请她  还有所有试镜的姑娘
And she, along with everyone else who auditioned,

468
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,290
都要告诉自己后面出场的人
made sure that the dancer that came after them

469
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,120
不要做爵士手势
didn't use the jazz hands

470
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,720
这样就不会被开除了
so that they didn't lose their job...

471
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,080
除了布丽奇特
until Bridget.

472
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,440
曼迪在我前面
Mandy came before me.

473
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,470
你不是说真的吧
You can't be serious.

474
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:38,810
只有诡计多端的狡诈的人
Only a scheming and conniving person

475
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:42,560
才会这么无情地想除去和自己共事的同伴
would so callously try to get a fellow cast mate fired.

476
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,960
真说不准你这种人会做出什么事
There's no telling how far someone like you will go.

477
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:48,400
他说的是真的吗  曼迪
Is he telling the truth, Mandy?

478
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,770
这重要吗
What does it matter?

479
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:51,230
反正你把手从中间
At least the hands distract away

480
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:53,580
向两边打开的动作也糟透了
from the dreadful syncopation problem you have.

481
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,480
你想我试镜失败吗
You wanted me to fail?

482
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,440
反正也不难
That's not hard.

483
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,590
你个贱人
You bitch.

484
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,620
瑞斯比
Uh, Rigsby?

485
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:02,020
等等  你刚刚喊我什么来着
Okay. I'm sorry. What did you just call me?

486
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,470
-不好意思  -拿开你的手
- Oh, I'm sorry... - Get your hands off me!

487
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,910
你介意去平息事态吗
You mind stepping in and handling this?

488
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:08,890
女士们  女士们  女士们
Ladies, ladies, ladies...

489
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:11,090
我还有点事
I have an errand to run.

490
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:20,990
帮帮忙
Help!

491
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,220
好了
Aah! Okay.

492
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,100
我知道你跟我说话就是为了套消息
I know you're only talking to me to get information out of me,

493
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,250
但是你人很好
but it's been nice.

494
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,140
让我很开心
You make me smile.

495
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,100
还有什么能比得上你的笑容呢
What's worth more than a smile?

496
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:36,100
说得真对
True enough.

497
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,530
列侬先生的伤势已经稳定下来了
Mr. Lennon is pretty much stable.

498
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,200
血容量也回升了
His blood volume is up,

499
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,030
明天一早医生就能让他从昏迷中
and the doctors could bring him out of the coma

500
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,400
苏醒过来
as early as tomorrow.

501
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,310
谢谢  很高兴了解到这些
Thank you. That's very good to know.

502
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:52,100
到底是怎么回事
What is all this about?

503
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:55,710
为什么联调局的人怪里怪气又神秘兮兮的
And why are the federal guys so weird and creepy?

504
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:58,530
是吗  他们怎么怪里怪气神秘兮兮的
They are? How are they weird and creepy?

505
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:00,100
好像他们表里不一
Like they're not what they seem.

506
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,670
好像有一天他们会撕下脸皮
Like one day they might pull their faces off,

507
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:05,820
露出外星蜥蜴人的脸出来
and there'd be alien lizards underneath, you know?

508
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:08,810
也不是没可能  就是可能性很低
I know. Not impossible, but very unlikely.

509
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:12,730
我知道  他们就是这种德性
I know. They just have that vibe.

510
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,000
是啊
I understand.

511
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,390
他们叫醒列侬先生时  你能通知我吗
Will you call me when they bring Mr. Lennon out of his coma?

512
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:19,510
没问题
Sure.

513
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:21,970
谢谢  非常感激
Thank you. I appreciate that.

514
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,790
这些抓痕挺引人注目的
Interesting set of scratch marks.

515
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:30,020
怎么回事
What happened?

516
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,190
猫抓的
Cat.

517
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,230
莎伦·沃里在遭到行凶抢劫的时候反击过
Sharon Warwick fought back against one of her attackers

518
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,450
其中一名袭击者
when she was mugged.

519
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:39,630
你知道吗
Know anything about that?

520
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,460
你知道谋杀发生后  他们在莎伦的
You know they found D.N.A. samples

521
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,800
指甲里找到了DNA样本吗
under Sharon's nails after the murder?

522
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,980
真是神奇啊  一点点DNA
It's amazing how a little D.N.A.

523
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,530
就能把两个人联系起来
can tie two people together.

524
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,590
好吧  是我袭击她的
Okay. The mugging, that was me.

525
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,900
我只是想吓吓她
I just wanted to scare her a little bit.

526
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,950
我没杀她
I didn't kill her.

527
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,450
你的同谋是谁
Who was your accomplice?

528
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,660
一个叫乔伊的人
A guy named Joey.

529
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,490
他是我在萨尔萨舞班上的舞伴
He's my partner in Salsa class.

530
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:04,340
你为什么想吓唬她
And why did you want to scare her?

531
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,700
因为她只是个名不见经传的女孩
Because she was just some girl

532
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,590
声音不错  但缺乏经验
with an okay voice and no resume,

533
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,750
而她竟然跟迪安德拉一起上了头条
and there she was headlining with Deandra.

534
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,950
那让你很恼火吗
And that made you mad?

535
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:12,980
女二号本应是我  而不是莎伦
Second lead should have been me, not Sharon.

536
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,540
所以当她出席募款晚宴
So when she showed up for the fund-raiser,

537
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,440
准备开始走上成名之路的时候
ready to launch a star-making turn,

538
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,540
你一时冲动  就将她推下了阳台
you snapped and you pushed her off that balcony.

539
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,250
我说了人不是我杀的
I told you I didn't kill her.

540
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:22,420
你已经承认策划了那场袭击
Well, you've already admitted to organizing an assault.

541
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,670
怀疑你一不做二不休
Why is it so crazy to think

542
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,210
把她杀了也是非常合理的
that you didn't decide to finish the job?

543
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,890
因为我并不想要她的命
Because I didn't want her dead,

544
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:28,710
我只想让她离开
I just wanted her to leave.

545
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:33,490
如果你要找嫌疑犯
If you're looking for suspects,

546
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:35,850
最好去查查演出的领衔主演
you might wanna check out the star of the show.

547
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,360
迪安德拉·桑德兰吗
Deandra Sunderland?

548
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,630
卑鄙女王
The queen of mean.

549
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,550
你为什么认为桑德兰会杀了沃里克
What makes you think Sunderland could have killed Warwick?

550
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:47,100
因为导演想让莎伦取代迪安德拉
Because the director wanted to replace Deandra with Sharon.

551
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,660
所有人都知道
Everybody knew it.

552
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:52,150
她年纪太大了  不适合扮演天真少女角色了
I mean she's too old to be playing the ingenue, right?

553
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,870
谋杀当晚  你见过桑德兰吗
Did you see Sunderland the night of the murder?

554
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,100
没有
No.

555
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:59,180
序曲开始的时候  到处都找不到她
She was nowhere to be found when the overture began.

556
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,840
意外发生之后呢
What about after the accident?

557
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,990
她直到第二天早上的排练才出现
Not until rehearsal the next morning.

00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:57,240
好的  不  那听起来很好
Yeah. Yes. No, that sounds good.

Sorry. Um, how long you gonna keep Mandy?

571
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:09,590
得关一阵子  对待犯法的人就要这样
A while. That's what we do when people break the law.

572
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,170
探员  我是专业人士
Okay, look, agent, I'm a pro.

573
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:12,240
我能够扭转这场灾难
I can spin this tragedy.

574
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,940
它甚至可让作品更吸引人
It can even add an air of fascination to the production.

575
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,870
但是  如果你们
But if you arrest the cast

576
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,840
在给投资商的演出进行之前逮捕演员的话
right before a performance for the investors,

577
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:20,650
那会让我的工作陷入困境
that makes my job rather difficult.

578
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:24,860
我得让投资商们保持兴趣
You see, I need my investors to stay... invested.

579
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,890
那先给你打个预防针
Well, brace yourself,

580
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,410
因为我要去找迪安德拉·桑德兰问话了

My apologies for interrupting.

589
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,130
我们得谈谈
We need to talk.

590
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:04,020
我正在排练  我希望不被打扰
I'm rehearsing here. I asked not to be disturbed.

591
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:06,240
这很重要
This is important.

592
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:09,320
莎伦·沃里克坠下阳台的时候你在哪里
Where were you when Sharon Warwick fell off the balcony?

593
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,340
我在宴会大厅
I was in the ballroom.

594
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:16,340
所有的证据都和你的说法相反
All of our evidence points to the contrary.

595
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:18,290
每一个和演出相关的人
Everybody involved in the production

596
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:20,140
都觉得你是跑去喝酒了
seems to think you were off drinking.

597
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:23,080
我认为你有可能和莎伦在一起
I think you might have been with Sharon.

598
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:26,920
我认为你发现了麦克塔维什打算
I think you found out that McTavish was planning

599
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,510
让她来取代你  然后你很恼火
on replacing you with her, and you got mad.

600
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,040
他想让莎伦取代我吗
He wanted Sharon to replace me?

601
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:35,870
她在学习你所有表演的录像
She was studying film of all of your performances

602
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:37,730
并且在背你的台词
and memorizing your lines.

603
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,370
你根本不理解
You don't understand.

604
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,400
你如果告诉她实情  她就会理解了
She would if you told her the truth.

605
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,130
你的歌声很美
You sing beautifully.

606
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,590
你在那待多久了
How long have you been out there?

607
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,280
很久了
Long enough.

608
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:04,680
我一直在想  是什么让莎伦·沃里克
You know, I kept wondering what brought Sharon Warwick

609
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,940
回到萨克拉门托
back to Sacramento.

610
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,110
她为了自己的追求离开萨克拉门托
She left Sacramento because she wanted something,

611
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,590
现在她回来了
and now she's back.

612
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:12,690
显然是和《火炬》有关
It's obviously connected to "Torch,"

613
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,920
但她所追寻的东西并不是观众的喝彩
but it couldn't be acclaim she was looking for,

614
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:16,940
因为那她在纽约已经实现了
'cause she got that in New York City.

615
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,770
后来我听到你唱歌  我才明白
And then I heard you sing, and it came to me.

616
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,240
每个被收养的孩子都在寻找的是什么
What is it that every foster child is looking for?

617
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,340
里斯本  这位是莎伦·沃里克的亲生母亲
Lisbon, I'd like you to meet Sharon Warwick's mother.

618
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,360
我有莎伦的时候
I was, uh...

619
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,890
还非常年轻
very young when I had Sharon.

620
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,010
她父亲是我的导演  他已经结婚了
Her father was my director, and he was married.

621
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:08,770
把她送走是我人生中最艰难的决定
The hardest thing I ever did in my life was giving her away.

622
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,010
你什么时候知道她是你女儿的
When did she learn she was your daughter?

623
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,180
她在第一天排练之后
She came to my dressing room

624
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:17,200
来到我的更衣室
after the first day of rehearsals.

625
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,700
你一定很震惊吧
Must have been a shock.

626
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:23,020
我很高兴她的成长
I felt so happy seeing the person that she had become.

627
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:26,390
她那么有才华
So talented, so...

628
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,330
充满活力
full of life.

629
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,810
你为什么保密呢
Why did you keep it a secret?

630
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:37,730
内疚  羞愧
Guilt. Shame.

631
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:40,400
还有其它的原因
Something else.

632
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:43,470
你在隐瞒其它原因
You're hiding something else.

633
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:48,560
你真是个聪明的警察
You're quite a clever policeman, aren't you?

634
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:54,090
我在六个月前被诊断出
I have multiple sclerosis,

635
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,820
患有多发性硬化症
diagnosed six months ago.

636
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:00,650
我很遗憾
Hmm. I'm sorry.

637
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,110
疾病的症状
Symptoms of the disease is what

638
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:07,170
让人们以为你在酗酒
made people think you were drinking.

639
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:10,490
我已经戒酒十四年了
Well, I've been sober for 14 years,

640
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:12,770
至今滴酒未沾
haven't touched a drop.

641
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,940
我听到别人在我背后的窃窃私语
I heard the whispers behind my back,

642
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,220
觉得是时候离开了
I thought it might be better to quit.

643
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,380
莎伦很生气
Sharon was so mad,

644
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,240
对我爱护备至
already protective towards me.

645
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:31,150
她告诉我要坚强
She told me to be strong.

646
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,750
你在第一场演出之前
And you had an attack

647
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:35,280
疾病发作了  是吗
right before the first performance, didn't you?

648
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:37,140
你没带药
You didn't have your medication.

649
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,230
是的
Yes.

650
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:42,260
莎伦说她会去楼上套房里帮你拿药
Sharon said she'd go up to the suite and get it for you.

651
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:48,300
她是个惊人的小姑娘
She was an incredible young woman.

652
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:52,370
所以我没法弃演
That's why I can't quit the show.

653
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,460
我不得不继续
I have to go on with it--

654
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:56,750
来祭奠我的孩子
to honor my child.

655
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,480
早
Morning.

656
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,150
-早  -早
- Morning. - Morning.

657
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:06,670
我们查了所有的照片  视频
We've been through all the photos, videos,

658
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:08,100
和监控录像
and security footage.

659
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,920
比对了每个来宾  酒店工作人员
Cross-indexed every guest, hotel worker,

660
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,250
出席者  以及演出相关人员
attendee, and person connected to the play.

661
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,510
所有人的行程都能证实  除了他
All their movements are accounted for, except for him.

662
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:17,150
伯恩特·汉诺威  那个投资商
Berndt Hanover, the investor?

663
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,660
这是他在凶案发生前
He, uh, here he is before the murder,

664
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,990
在进电梯
getting into the elevator.

665
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:23,610
他去了莎伦·沃里克遇害的楼层
He goes to the floor Sharon Warwick was killed on

666
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:26,220
然后下来  之后就不见了
and gets off, and that's the last time we see him.

667
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,440
什么意思  怎么可能
What do you mean? How can that be?

668
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,480
不知道  他再也没上电梯
I don't know. He never gets back on the elevator,

669
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,420
也没人见到他离开大楼
and he's never seen leaving the building.

670
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:35,880
好  可怎么会  为什么  他怎么做到离开大楼
Okay, but how? Why? How does he leave the building

671
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,130
而不被人看到的
without being seen?

672
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:39,530
如果他等到走廊没人
If he waited until the hallway was empty,

673
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:42,010
他可能走下楼到一层
he could've taken the stairs down to the first floor.

674
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,980
就算是这样  他之后怎么躲过别人的视线
Yeah, but how does he avoid being seen after that?

675
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,840
他又不是什么不起眼的小人物
It--it's not like he's a guy who doesn't stand out.

676
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,910
没错
True.

677
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,930
这是案发的房间
This is the room the murder took place.

678
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:56,490
那里是阳台  门口通往走廊
That's the balcony. Doorway out here to the corridor.

679
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:59,760
走楼梯  下去坐电梯
Past the stairs, down to the elevators.

680
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:05,350
如果我没记错  这里是通往消防梯的窗户
This, if I recall, was a window out to a fire escape.

681
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:06,790
他可能从消防梯下去吗
Could he have gone down a fire escape?

682
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:08,860
他块头很大  我觉得他身手没那么敏捷
He's a big man. I don't think he's that agile.

683
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:09,940
那怎么回事
Then what?

684
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:12,800
对  这是个谜题
Hmm. Yes, it's a puzzle.

685
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:16,390
你怎么看上去那么高兴
Why do you look so happy?

686
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:17,970
你有办法解开这个谜题
You have a way to solve the puzzle?

687
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,470
那是自然
Naturally.

688
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:24,990
剧院见
Meet me at the theater.

689
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:33,320
干得好
This is good work.

690
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:35,940
及时向我汇报进展
Keep me informed of your progress.

691
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:49,660
你在门口偷偷摸摸干什么呢  简先生
Why are you lurking out there, Mr. Jane?

692
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,910
我要你帮忙
I need a favor.

693
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,180
是不是我帮了你的忙
Is this the type of favor where...

694
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:02,010
你就欠我个人情
You would then owe me a favor?

695
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:04,120
实际上  你已经欠我个人情了
Actually, you already owe me a favor,

696
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,460
可如果你高兴  我可以另借你个人情
but I'll spot you another if that pleases you.

697
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,000
你要什么
What do you need?

698
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,140
要你
I need you.

699
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,090
好  还有十五分钟开幕  各位
Okay, 15 minutes to curtain, people.

700
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:17,440
加油  加油
Let's pick it up, pick it up.

701
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:24,730
迪安德拉  别忘了在第一个前奏时
Um, hey, Deandra, uh, don't forget to wait

702
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:26,700
等三个小节  好吗
three bars in the first intro, okay?

703
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,760
亲爱的  我在你学会擦鼻子之前
Darling, I've been doing this since before you learned

704
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,490
就已经在这一行了
to wipe your own nose.

705
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:32,540
管好自己的事吧
Worry about your own business.

706
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:36,910
别指导  别指导
Never direct. Never direct.

707
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:41,970
女士们  先生们  请各位有序入场
Ladies and gentlemen, if you will kindly enter the theater

708
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:43,360
并就座
and take your seats, please.

709
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,890
里斯本  你到剧场了吗
Hey, Lisbon, you at the theater yet?

710
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,330
简  你在哪儿
Jane, where are you?

711
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,890
在路上  快到了
Uh, on my way. Almost there.

712
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:59,260
你去后台  我们马上去找你
You head backstage. We'll see you in a minute.

713
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:01,050
我们  还有谁
We? Who's we? Uh...

714
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:02,800
很快就见到了  里斯本  再见
I'll see you very soon, Lisbon. Bye.

715
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,750
我心里真没底
I don't know about this.

716
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:08,130
相信我  你会觉得很有意思
Oh, trust me. You'll have fun.

717
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:10,910
"相信我  你会觉得很有意思"
"Trust me. You'll have fun."

718
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,440
还有什么情况会这更可疑
Was there ever a more suspicious phase?

719
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:17,370
J.J.  你该给生活找点乐子
J.J., you have to live a little.

720
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:20,260
你每天都在抓小偷
You spend your days chasing paper clip thieves.

721
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,780
什么时候能有机会揪住凶手
When do you ever get the chance to nail a killer?

722
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,600
是没有
No, it's true.

723
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:25,950
我很乐意帮忙
I'm happy to help.

724
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:32,920
我担心的是我的表现
It's the performance aspect that concerns me.

725
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:36,710
什么表现
What performance aspect?

726
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:38,150
你进入房间
You go into a room.

727
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,890
如果有人和你说话
If someone says anything to you,

728
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:43,240
你就说  "哈哈哈"  或"可能吧"...
you say, "Ha ha ha", or "perhaps"...

729
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,410
哈哈哈
Ha ha ha.

730
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:48,830
可能吧
Perhaps.

731
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:51,900
够了
Good enough.

732
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,430
要带口音吗
Would an accent help?

733
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,950
简单就好
Keep it simple.

734
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:04,400
你们都知道  这场演出
As you know, this, uh, show

735
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,400
在过去的几天里
has faced a great deal of hardship and tragedy

736
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,840
遭遇了极大的困难和灾难
the past few days.

737
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:12,530
可我能告诉你们  这只会让我们变得更强
But I can tell you that it has only made us stronger.

738
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:18,890
-谢谢  -晚上好  里斯本  找到乐子了吗
- Thank you. - Evening, Lisbon, you having fun yet?

739
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:20,700
你来了  刚才去哪里了  你有什么计划
There you are. Where have you been and what's your plan?

740
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,580
等一下告诉你
I will tell you in one minute.

741
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,920
晚上好  真是个美好的夜晚
Oh, good evening, and what an evening it is.

742
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,680
里斯本  你认识道奇先生吗
Lisbon, you remember Mr. Dodge?

743
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,700
当然
Of course.

744
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:30,020
两位警探  有事吗
Agents, what are you doing here?

745
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,510
我告诉你  道奇先生
Well, I've gotta tell you, Mr. Dodge,

746
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,220
看了那么多场彩排
after watching all those rehearsals,

747
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,090
我们欲罢不能  可以看表演吗
we couldn't just stay away, could we?

748
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:36,950
好  沃伦  你该上台说话了
Okay, uh, Warren, you're supposed to go say something.

749
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,980
好  我知道  我准备好了
Yes, I know. I'm ready.

750
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:41,490
最后  有请我们尊敬的制片人
Finally, let me introduce our esteemed producer,

751
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:43,440
沃伦·道奇  来讲话
Warren Dodge, to tell you...

752
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,670
那是谁
Who is that?

753
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,880
天呐  是伯恩特·汉诺威
Oh, my goodness. It's Berndt Hanover.

754
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,490
汉诺威先生
Mr. Hanover. Hi.

755
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:53,530
真让人惊喜
What a wonderful surprise.

756
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,790
汉诺威先生  真荣幸
Mr. Hanover, such an honor.

757
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:03,080
我是西尔维亚·克莱尔  我们通过电话
I'm--I'm Sylvia Clare. We spoke on the phone.

758
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,570
旅途还顺利吧
Your trip was a good one, I hope?

759
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:07,090
是的  很顺利  谢谢  克莱尔女士
Yes, it was very good. Thank you, Ms. Clare.

760
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:08,060
-好  -请问
- Sure. - Excuse me.

761
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,070
怎么回事
What's going on?

762
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:14,070
沃伦  你怎么不出来跟可爱的观众们说说话
Warren? Why don't you come out and talk to the lovely people?

763
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,950
克莱尔女士  我是来给我的投资者们
Ms. Clare, I have come to address

764
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:18,570
发表讲话的
my fellow investors.

765
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:20,910
不如我去给他们说说话
Why don't I go and speak to them now?

766
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:21,680
什么
What?

767
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,800
太好了  真是个好主意
Oh, terrific. That is a great idea.

768
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,830
-不是吗  沃伦  -你是谁
- Isn't it, Warren? - Who are you, huh?

769
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,090
怎么了  等等  你在干什么
W-w-w-whoa. Wait. What are you doing?

770
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:29,010
他不是伯恩特·汉诺威  他是冒牌货
He's not Berndt Hanover. He's a fraud!

771
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:31,470
沃伦  怎么回事
Warren! What is going on?

772
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,700
我不知道他在耍什么把戏
I don't know what game he's playing,

773
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:33,540
反正他不是汉诺威
but he's not Hanover.

774
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,160
你在说什么  不然他是谁
Well, what are you saying? Then who is he?

775
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,770
他叫J.J.拉罗彻
His name is J.J. LaRoche.

776
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:40,150
道奇先生说得对  他不是伯恩特·汉诺威
Mr. Dodge is correct. It isn't Berndt Hanover.

777
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,390
好吧  我一头雾水
Okay, I'm totally confused.

778
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:44,310
我们伪装了他  帽子和眼镜
Ah, we faked it--the hat, the glasses,

779
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:45,960
手杖  大衣
the cane, the coat.

780
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,280
瞧  伯恩特·汉诺威出现了
Et voila. Berndt Hanover.

781
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,450
可是这是为了什么
But why?

782
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:51,840
做个测试  你们都以为是他
A test. You all believe it was him,

783
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,950
而且让你们相信易如反掌
and it was easy to make you believe it.

784
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:57,910
可好景不长  他把我拆穿了
For about ten seconds, until he said that I wasn't.

785
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:00,640
然后你们就没人相信是他了
And then nobody believed it anymore,

786
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,530
而我也不再相信
just like I don't believe anymore

787
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:04,900
这世界上有伯恩特·汉诺威这个人存在
that Berndt Hanover exists.

788
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,630
什么  太荒唐了
What? Well, that's ridiculous.

789
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:08,770
-是吗  -当然有伯恩特·汉诺威这个人了
- Is it? - Of course Berndt Hanover exists.

790
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:09,870
那就叫他出来吧
Then produce him.

791
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:11,620
你不是这方面的专家吗  他在哪儿呢
You're a producer. Where is he?

792
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,000
我总不能把他变出来吧
Well... I just can't magically make him appear.

793
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,950
给他打电话
Call him.

794
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:18,790
简先生  我手边没他的电话号码
Mr. Jane, I don't have his phone number on me.

795
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:19,660
难以置信
Hard to believe.

796
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:22,240
在我办公室呢
You know, uh, it's at my office,

797
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,020
我等会儿去那儿打给他
and I will call him there, uh, when I'm--

798
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,580
-我有  我来打  -还好
- I have it. I'll call him. - That's lucky.

799
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:28,300
-我打了  -很好
- I'm calling him. - Good idea.

800
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,720
-通了  -太好了
- It's ringing. - Excellent.

801
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,470
他可能不会接  他很忙的
He might not answer. He's a--he's a very busy man.

802
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:36,340
那是
Of course.

803
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,100
打扰一下
Excuse me.

804
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:46,170
你的衣服在演奏《第五交响曲》呢
Your coat is playing the "Fifth Symphony."

805
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:50,150
不接吗  道奇先生
Gonna answer that, Mr. Dodge?

806
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,940
还是该称你为
Or should we call you mister...

807
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:56,480
汉诺威先生
Hanover?

808
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:00,160
你好  抱歉
Hello? Sorry.

809
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,870
道奇先生现在没空接电话  西尔维亚
Mr. Dodge can't come to the phone right now, Sylvia.

810
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:05,750
他正忙着被抓起来呢
He's a little busy getting arrested.

811
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,340
汉诺威没坐电梯下楼
Hanover didn't come down in the elevator,

812
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:11,380
因为汉诺威这人根本就不存在
because Hanover never even existed.

813
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,310
道奇从一开始就扮上了
Dodge was playing the part from the beginning.

814
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:16,520
他撕下伪装
He took off his disguise,

815
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,830
为躲避摄像头  从逃生梯下楼
eluded the cameras by coming down a fire escape.

816
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,970
里斯本  他归你了
Lisbon, he's all yours.

817
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,970
你被捕了
You're under arrest.

818
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:29,610
有意思吧
Tell me that wasn't fun.

819
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:34,320
谈不上  不过咱俩扯平了吧
I cannot tell you that, but we are even, yes?

820
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,820
扯平了
Yes.

821
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:43,260
只要能让演出打响  我什么都豁得出去
I wanted the show to work. I was willing to do anything.

822
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,790
杀人都不在话下吗
Even kill?

823
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,400
我
W... I...

824
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,300
她吓了我一跳
She surprised me.

825
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,970
我当时想换掉扮演汉诺威的那身行头
When I was changing out of the Hanover costume,

826
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:53,990
那会儿那个房间里不应该有人
nobody was supposed to be in the room at that time.

827
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:55,320
一个人都不该有
Nobody.

828
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:58,520
我跟她说  我为这场演出倾尽了所有
I told her that I put every penny I had into the show

829
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:03,080
需要有汉诺威这么个人  给投资商信心
and that Hanover was necessary to give our investors a confidence

830
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:03,610
给他们吃下定心丸
and peace of mind

831
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:05,860
我告诉她  只要我赚足了钱
and that once I had the money I needed,

832
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,700
就会让汉诺威消失
I would make Hanover disappear

833
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:11,170
最终一切都会迎刃而解
and that everything would work out in the end.

834
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:13,510
但她不肯
But she said no.

835
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:17,590
她不想参与
She wouldn't be any part of it...

836
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:21,100
她说要告诉桑德兰
That she was going to tell Sunderland,

837
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:24,050
那一切自然就穿帮了
which of course meant that everyone would find out

838
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:27,970
全都毁了
and... that would have ruined everything.

839
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:39,150
真的  我没想到会变成这样
Yeah. I didn't mean for this to happen.

840
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:40,700
接下来发生了什么
So what happened next?

841
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:44,900
我从逃生梯逃走了  没被人看见
Uh, I left by the fire escape. No one saw me.

842
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:48,060
然后到了我停在街角的车里
And then I went and got in my car around the corner,

843
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:51,080
再把车开回来  见到了警察
and I drove up and introduced myself to the police.

844
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:58,660
这场演出要是一炮而红  我就能重回巅峰了
This was gonna be the hit show that put me back on top.

845
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,360
本来可以皆大欢喜的
Everyone would have benefited.

846
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:06,930
要是她没走进那扇门就好了
If only she hadn't walked through that door.

847
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:25,660
我跟她在一起的时间很少
I, um, I didn't have nearly enough time with her.

848
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:30,000
但我非常爱她  很佩服她
But I so loved the person that she was and respected her.

849
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:35,070
谢谢你们为她主持公道
Thank you for giving her justice.

850
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:36,670
这对我意义重大
It means a lot.

851
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:39,570
抱歉
I'm sorry.

852
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:41,790
不好意思  我得接个电话
Embarrassing. Uh, I have to take this.

853
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,240
-失陪  -接吧
- Excuse me. - Of course.

854
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:46,100
-你好  -派翠克  我是医院的希拉
- Hello? - Patrick, it's Sheila from the hospital.

855
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,250
医生让他醒过来了
They're bringing him out of the coma.

856
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,380
什么时候
When?

857
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:51,850
你得快点过来
You need to get over here.

858
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:55,060
好
Okay.

859
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,640
他清醒了  不过得留意着他
He's conscious, but keep an eye on him.

860
00:38:58,090 --> 00:38:59,670
有事按那个钮  我们马上过来
Hit that button, and we'll be right in.

861
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,400
好的  谢谢  护士
Okay, thank you, nurse.

862
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,510
杰森·列侬  你这混蛋命够硬的
You are one tough S.O.B., Jason Lennon.

863
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:15,660
命真硬
You really are.

864
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:18,550
我在哪儿
Where am I?

865
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,130
出什么事了
What happened?

866
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:25,800
你在萨克拉门托  你中枪了
You're in Sacramento. You got shot.

867
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,260
记得吗
Do you remember that?

868
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:31,090
记得
Yes, I do.

869
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:33,000
劳拉蕾·马丁斯开的枪
Lorelei Martins.

870
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,480
没错  很好  很好  你头脑清楚了
Correct. Very good. Good. Your mind is clear.

871
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,070
现在听着  我有个问题要问你  杰森
Now listen, I have a question for you, Jason.

872
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:40,860
看着我
Look at me.

873
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,970
看仔细了
Look close.

874
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,410
认识我吗
You recognize me?

875
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:47,350
以前见过我没有
You ever seen me before?

876
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,490
没有
No.

877
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:51,650
确定吗  这很重要
Are you sure? It's important.

878
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,450
是的
Yes.

879
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:57,840
我确定
I'm sure.

880
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:01,340
这就好  谢谢
That's good to know. Thanks.

881
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:04,790
你是谁
Who are you?

882
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,550
一个朋友
I'm a friend.

883
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,310
谈点儿实际的吧  杰森
Let's face facts, Jason.

884
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:29,060
你要是恢复了  活了下来
If you recover and live,

885
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,240
会被控谋杀  蹲一辈子大牢
you'll spend life in prison for murder--

886
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,990
沦为那些变态的玩物
the plaything of monsters.

887
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:44,480
要是换做我
I just hope that if I'm ever in your shoes,

888
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,250
我希望能有个好朋友为我做这件事
I have a friend close enough to do this for me.

889
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:50,710
等等
Wait.

890
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:53,710
别怕
Don't be scared.

891
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,480
很快的
This'll be quick.

892
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,600
不怎么痛
Very little pain.

893
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,530
没事  好了
It's okay. It's all right.

894
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:14,830
没事的  我在这儿陪你
It's okay. I'm here for you.

895
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:16,950
我不会走的
I won't leave you.

896
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:32,600
来人啊  护士
Help! Nurse!

897
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:33,720
护士
Nurse!

898
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,220
是室颤
He's in V-fib.

899
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:36,690
把急救车推进来
Get that crash cart over here.

900
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,790
怎么了
What happened?

901
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:57,240
派翠克  很遗憾
Patrick, I'm sorry.

902
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,820
他心脏衰竭
His heart gave out.

903
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:02,990
一句话都没留下
Never said a word.
