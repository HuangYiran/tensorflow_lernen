Kate给你留了个带有地图的瓶子
Kate leaves you a bottle with a map on it,

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,201
却带我们来到了... 纽约中央车站?
and this is where it leads us... Grand Central Station?

5
00:00:21,268 --> 00:00:22,934
这肯定有我认识的东西 Moz

是熟悉的东西
Something familiar.

10
00:00:28,967 --> 00:00:31,001
她本可以指引我们到任何地方
She could have sent us anywhere,

11
00:00:31,067 --> 00:00:33,001
结果却是可以去任何地方的车站?
so she sends us to a place that leads everywhere?

12
00:00:33,067 --> 00:00:34,533
Moz 看
Moz.

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,433
这有一家很好的牡蛎餐厅
You know, there's a great oyster bar in there.

14
00:00:43,234 --> 00:00:46,533
我觉得那里面有东西
Hey, I think there's something in here.

15
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,334
"X"标记地点... 又一次吗?

我希望我能解释 但是时间不允许

19
00:01:01,334 --> 00:01:03,734
但是你不要再找我了
but you need to stop looking.

20
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,934
我们曾经深爱过 但一切都结束了
No one can deny what we have, but it's over.

21
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:08,600
请放手向前
Please move on.

22
00:01:08,667 --> 00:01:09,867
Kate敬上"
Kate."

23
00:01:13,001 --> 00:01:14,767
留了这么多密码 就说了一句"放手向前"
All this for "move on".

24
00:01:14,834 --> 00:01:16,101
太矛盾了
Oddly bipolar.

25
00:01:16,167 --> 00:01:18,500
我宁愿去吃点牡蛎
I'd rather have some oysters.

26
00:01:35,268 --> 00:01:36,334

Coffee?

32
00:01:44,834 --> 00:01:46,901
没时间喝咖啡了 有个画作失窃案

豪斯腾伯格的作品
Haustenberg.

36
00:01:51,767 --> 00:01:53,400
豪斯腾伯格啊...
Haustenberg, well...

37
00:01:53,467 --> 00:01:55,334
在博物馆失窃的吗?

38
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,567

我想见见
I'd like to meet the person

40
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,334
把豪斯腾伯格的画挂在墙上的人
who keeps a Haustenberg over their mantel.

41
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:11,925
大爱豪斯滕伯格 哪一幅画作被偷了?
Love Haustenberg. Which one of his paintings is stolen?

42
00:02:13,001 --> 00:02:15,467
这幅画叫"戴金挂坠的女孩'

43
00:02:15,533 --> 00:02:16,634
没照片吗?
No photograph?

44
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,500
没有 但我敢肯定这幅画上
No, but I bet you it's a painting

45
00:02:18,567 --> 00:02:20,433
画着个带金挂坠的女孩
of a young girl wearing a locket.

46
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,368
你的推理能力我可不敢恭维
You don't get enough credit for your deductive skills.

47
00:02:23,433 --> 00:02:24,700
这幅画价值超过两百万美元
It's worth $2 million and change.

48
00:02:24,767 --> 00:02:25,867
真厉害
That's nice.

49
00:02:25,934 --> 00:02:27,334
豪斯腾伯格的画很少见
Haustenbergs are rare.

50
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,734
他的作品只有很少在战争后流出了匈牙利
Not many of his works made it out of Hungary after the war.

51
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,500
是啊 稀少所以才值钱... 非常的值钱
Yeah. Rare can make it valuable... very valuable.

52
00:02:32,567 --> 00:02:34,001
你这么看着我干吗?
What are you looking at me for?

53
00:02:34,067 --> 00:02:35,134
为什么这么问?
Why do you think?

54
00:02:35,201 --> 00:02:36,433
我没偷
I didn't steal it.

55
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,934
我知道你没偷
I know you didn't steal it,

56
00:02:38,001 --> 00:02:39,301
但是你喜欢画作
but you like paintings.

57
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:40,734
我担心如果我们找到了它
I'm worried that if we find it,

58
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,334
会对你产生巨大的诱惑
it may be too much temptation for you.

59
00:02:42,433 --> 00:02:44,134
我会抵制诱惑
I can handle temptation.

60
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:48,967
你能盯着前面的路吗?
Do you want to keep your eyes on the road?

61
00:02:49,034 --> 00:02:51,034
这是辆福特金牛座 可以自动刹车的
This is a Taurus. Car can take care of itself.

62
00:02:51,101 --> 00:02:52,334
我要盯着你
I'm keeping my eyes on you.

63
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,134
好吧 随你 看路也很重要
Good, good. The road is important, too.

64
00:02:54,201 --> 00:02:55,834
我看着的 抱歉
I see the road. Sorry about that.

65
00:02:55,901 --> 00:02:57,901
别 别道歉 那是... 他停下的错
No. Don't apologize. That was... he stopped.

66
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:03,301
你知道我没偷 你查看了我的脚铐记录?
You know I didn't steal it. You checked my anklet?

67
00:03:03,368 --> 00:03:04,867
我一直在查看记录
I always check your anklet.

68
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:07,167
我每天对着地图检查
I pull a map up on you every day

69
00:03:07,234 --> 00:03:08,934
那我就能知道你每天去了哪
so I can see exactly where you've been.

70
00:03:09,001 --> 00:03:12,268
纽约中央车站有什么有趣的东西吗?

牡蛎餐厅啊... 城里最好的了

72
00:03:14,867 --> 00:03:17,433
我待在我的两公里活动范围内
I stayed within my two-mile radius.

73
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,034
我在想 你的活动范围是不是太大了
I wonder if we've been a little too generous on that.

74
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:23,167
天啊
Oh, yeah.

75
00:03:23,234 --> 00:03:25,234
怎么 你还不高兴了?
What, are you gonna sulk now?

76
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:27,001
你不信任我
You don't trust me.

77
00:03:27,067 --> 00:03:28,800
里根(美国总统)说过什么?
What did Reagan say?

78
00:03:28,867 --> 00:03:30,201
"信任他 但要核查"
"Trust, but verify."

79
00:03:30,268 --> 00:03:32,767
还有句出自苏联秘密警察的名言
That was also the motto of the Soviet secret police.

80
00:03:32,834 --> 00:03:34,368
同志们 学着适应吧
Get used to it, comrade.

81
00:03:34,433 --> 00:03:35,834
看路!
Eyes! Road!

82
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:38,500
我们还是专注办案吧
Let's just recover the painting.

83
00:03:38,567 --> 00:03:40,867
是啊 还有开车
Yeah, and drive.

84
00:03:40,934 --> 00:03:43,634
联邦调查局都出动了... 你们很看重这事啊?
Wow, so, the FBI... you're really taking this seriously, huh?

85
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,901
是的
We are.

86
00:03:44,967 --> 00:03:46,967
你是房子的主人吗?
Are you the homeowner?

87
00:03:47,034 --> 00:03:48,400
是的
Yes.

88
00:03:48,467 --> 00:03:49,867
这样啊

89
00:03:49,934 --> 00:03:53,433
我父母去世了 我已经21岁了 还有我被盗了
My parents are dead, I'm over 21, and I was robbed.

90
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,901
还有什么问题吗?
Any other questions?

91
00:03:54,967 --> 00:03:56,400
画上过保险吗?
Was the painting insured?

92
00:03:56,467 --> 00:03:57,467
没有
No.

93
00:03:57,533 --> 00:03:58,934
它可值两百六十万啊
It's worth $2.6 million.

94
00:04:02,634 --> 00:04:04,368
它原来在那
That's where it was.

95
00:04:06,101 --> 00:04:07,967
星期二我有课
Tuesdays I have classes.

96
00:04:08,034 --> 00:04:09,734
老师提前下了课
Uh, the instructor let us out early.

97
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:14,934
我进家门 看见有个... 怪物在那
I came in here, and there was this... monster here,

98
00:04:15,001 --> 00:04:16,834
他把我按在墙上

他伤到你了吗?
He hurt you?

100
00:04:18,101 --> 00:04:19,334
是的
Yeah.

101

我一拳打在他脸上
I hit him in the face,

102
00:04:20,967 --> 00:04:23,901
他说 我再打他 就杀了我
and he said if I did it again, he would kill me.

103
00:04:23,967 --> 00:04:25,167
然后呢?
What did you do?

104
00:04:25,234 --> 00:04:26,967
我又打了他
I hit him again.

105
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,400
你有画的照片吗?

这个窃贼是内部人吧?

小偷了解她的行程 除了画什么都没拿

133
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:32,368
你看上去不像是联邦探员啊
You don't look like an FBI agent.

134
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,234
我也当这是夸我了
I'll take that as a compliment.

135

联邦探员是什么样?
What's an FBI agent look like?

136

我从没见过那么快申请律师了的
I've never seen a guy lawyer up that fast.

I've got that he's a stock trader on Wall Street

142
00:06:11,234 --> 00:06:12,467
然后他就让我
and that his attorney

143
00:06:12,533 --> 00:06:15,067
问他的律师了
will answer any further questions I might have.

144
00:06:15,134 --> 00:06:16,100
那么 Gary叔叔给小偷提供了情报
So, uncle Gary tips off the thief,

145
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,334
从其中分成
splits the take.

146
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,001
更可能是他欠了别人钱
More likely uncle Gary owes money to somebody,

147
00:06:20,068 --> 00:06:22,601
然后他受够了看着两百万美元的画
and he got tired of staring at 2 million bucks

148
00:06:22,667 --> 00:06:23,867
挂在墙上
hanging on the wall.

149
00:06:23,934 --> 00:06:26,867
他既然什么都不肯定说 我们要来点强制手段
Now he shuts up, and we do this the hard way.

150
00:06:27,334 --> 00:06:28,301
什么强制手段?
The hard way?

151
00:06:28,368 --> 00:06:30,200
我们只需要知道跟他合作的那个小偷叫什么 是吧?
All we need from Gary is the name of the guy he's working with, right?

152
00:06:30,267 --> 00:06:32,500
- 是的  - 那为什么不让我跟他谈谈?
- Right.  - So, why don't I talk to him?

153
00:06:32,567 --> 00:06:33,600
- 你?  - 是啊 
- You?  - Yeah.

154
00:06:33,667 --> 00:06:35,501
好... 好吧 我再说一遍
O... Okay, let me rephrase that.

155
00:06:35,567 --> 00:06:36,801
因为我只是个顾问
Since I am a consultant

156
00:06:36,868 --> 00:06:38,968
不是严格意义上的联邦调查局的...
and not technically an employee of the FBI...

157
00:06:39,033 --> 00:06:40,934
是假释试用期的顾问
A consultant on a tenuous probation.

158
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,367
我从不敢忘
As I'm constantly reminded.

159
00:06:42,434 --> 00:06:44,467
我跟他谈话有什么不合法的地方吗?
Is there anything illegal about me talking to him?

160
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,752
- 不准威胁他  - 没这个打算
- You can't threaten him.  - Don't plan to.

161
00:06:47,752 --> 00:06:48,501
不准骗他
Or lie to him.

162
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:51,767
好吧
All right.

163
00:06:51,834 --> 00:06:53,234
好吧 不骗他
All right. No lying.

164
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,501
我只是要问他名字
I'm just gonna ask him for the name.

165
00:07:03,033 --> 00:07:04,334
告诉我 Gary
Tell me, Gary,

166
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,100
Julianna知道你帮别人偷了那幅画吗?
Does Julianna know you helped steal the painting?

167
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:08,234
你不能在这
You can't be here.

168
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,734
我的律师说得很清楚
My lawyer was very clear.

169
00:07:09,801 --> 00:07:12,300
首先 雇律师显得你有罪
First of all, hiring a lawyer makes you look guilty.

170
00:07:12,367 --> 00:07:14,601
律师明确告诉我 不能跟联邦调查局的人讲话
He told me specifically not to talk to the FBI.

171
00:07:16,701 --> 00:07:18,467
我看上去像联邦探员吗?
Do I look like an FBI agent?

172
00:07:21,367 --> 00:07:22,801
你是谁?
Who are you?

173
00:07:22,868 --> 00:07:25,033
好好想想 Gary
Think hard, Gary.

174
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,801
他派你来的?
Did he send you?

175
00:07:28,867 --> 00:07:31,001
你觉得呢?
What do you think?

176
00:07:31,067 --> 00:07:33,101
天啊 我就知道会这样
God, I knew this would happen.

177
00:07:33,168 --> 00:07:34,801
难道整件事都是个圈套?
What, that whole thing at the house was a setup?

178
00:07:34,867 --> 00:07:36,001
怎么会出错的?
How'd it go wrong?

179
00:07:36,068 --> 00:07:38,200
Julianna不该在那
Julianna wasn't supposed to be there.

180
00:07:38,267 --> 00:07:39,500
现在她是个目击证人
Now she's a witness.

181
00:07:39,567 --> 00:07:42,068
这不关我的事 她提前下课了
It wasn't my fault. Her class got out early.

182
00:07:42,133 --> 00:07:43,467
请别伤害她
Please don't hurt her.

183
00:07:43,534 --> 00:07:45,100
你要说服的不是我
It's not me you need to convince.

184
00:07:45,167 --> 00:07:47,167
告诉他...
Tell him...

185
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:50,167
告诉他 我保证她不会是个麻烦
tell him I'll make sure she doesn't cause any trouble.

186
00:07:50,233 --> 00:07:52,267
她已经对画师描述罪犯长相了
She's ready to sit with a sketch artist.

187
00:07:52,334 --> 00:07:55,200
这种情况让他很难
This is the kind of thing that makes it much harder for him

188
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:56,434
把画卖掉
to sell the painting.

189
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,968
这样... 好吗?
How about... here?

190
00:07:58,034 --> 00:08:00,467
我交保证金怎么样?
How about a good-faith payment?

191
00:08:00,534 --> 00:08:03,133
这有三百 我身上就这么多
Here. Here's $300. That's all I got.

192
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,001
才三百
$300.

193
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,934
Gary啊
Gary.

194
00:08:07,001 --> 00:08:09,367
好吧 你是对的
All right, you're right. You're right.

195
00:08:11,801 --> 00:08:13,167
我给他开张支票吧
I can write him a check.

196
00:08:15,767 --> 00:08:18,034
这个可以
That could work.

197
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,200
他给你开了张个人支票
He wrote you a personal check

198
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:22,801
给偷了他母亲的画的人
to the guy he helped steal his mother's painting.

199
00:08:22,867 --> 00:08:24,634
他执意这么做
He was very insistent.

200
00:08:24,701 --> 00:08:26,701
没有威胁 没有撒谎
No threats. No lies.

201
00:08:26,767 --> 00:08:28,267
都是他自愿坦白的
I let him do all the talking.

202
00:08:28,334 --> 00:08:30,601
我把这叫做"灰色地带"
I'm calling this a "gray area".

203
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,734
是Gerard Dorsett啊
Oh. Gerard Dorsett.

204
00:08:34,801 --> 00:08:36,133
- 你知道他?  - 是啊
- You know him?  - Yeah.

205
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,500
是啊 他是个... 坏蛋
Yeah, he's a... bad guy.

206
00:08:38,567 --> 00:08:39,934
我知道
So I figured.

207
00:08:41,834 --> 00:08:43,367
Julianna怎么办?
Hey, what about Julianna?

208
00:08:43,434 --> 00:08:45,400
他知道了她跟我们谈过话...
He figures out she's talking to us...

209
00:08:45,467 --> 00:08:48,367
让我们在坏事发生前抓住这混蛋
Let's catch the bastard before that happens.

210
00:08:52,467 --> 00:08:53,801
是啊 我们找到他了
Yeah, we got him.

211
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,834
而且已经监视他两天了
We've been sitting on him for two days.

212
00:08:55,901 --> 00:08:58,400
他们跑遍了曼哈顿的所有高级画廊
They've gone to every high-end gallery in Manhattan

213
00:08:58,467 --> 00:08:59,634
要出手那幅豪斯滕伯格的画
offering the Haustenberg.

214
00:08:59,701 --> 00:09:00,867
那个人是谁?
Who's that?

215
00:09:00,934 --> 00:09:02,400
那个大块头? 他是Joshua
The big guy? Joshua.

216
00:09:02,467 --> 00:09:04,500
退役军人 偷走画的人就是他
Ex-military, the muscle who stole the painting.

217
00:09:04,567 --> 00:09:06,200
Julianna说打了他一拳 还真不是开玩笑的
Julianna wasn't kidding about the punch.

218
00:09:06,267 --> 00:09:07,534
那女孩可够有劲的
Girl has an arm.

219
00:09:07,601 --> 00:09:10,267
另一个家伙是Dorsett 法国移民
And the other guy is Dorsett, French expat.

220
00:09:10,334 --> 00:09:13,467
除了勒索股票经纪人 他还对什么事感兴趣?
What's he into, besides shaking down stockbrokers?

221
00:09:13,534 --> 00:09:15,367
放高利贷
High-end loan-sharking,

222
00:09:15,434 --> 00:09:16,934
但说他是放高利贷的人
although calling him a loan shark

223
00:09:17,001 --> 00:09:18,734
就像说俄狄浦斯(希腊神话中弑父娶母的人)是妈妈的乖宝宝一样
is like calling Oedipus a mama's boy.

224
00:09:18,801 --> 00:09:22,167
他用大笔公款放高利贷
He makes questionable loans with big corporate money.

225
00:09:22,233 --> 00:09:25,200
不还钱的话 他就去烧了你的办公室
Get behind on your payment, he'll firebomb your office.

226
00:09:26,734 --> 00:09:29,667
不过好消息是 你明天就会见到他
But the good news is, you get to meet him tomorrow.

227
00:09:29,734 --> 00:09:30,901
你怎么安排的?
How'd you arrange that?

228
00:09:30,968 --> 00:09:32,001
是我安排的
I set it up.

229
00:09:34,467 --> 00:09:36,934
Neal 这是Taryn Vandersant
Neal, this is Taryn Vandersant.

230
00:09:37,001 --> 00:09:38,801
她是Lambert画廊的顾客
She's a buyer at the Lambert gallery

231
00:09:38,867 --> 00:09:40,968
而且还很热心地要帮我们解决这个案子
and is nice enough to help us out on this one.

232
00:09:41,034 --> 00:09:43,400
我让Dorsett相信 我这里有一位有钱的买家
I convinced Dorsett I have a wealthy client

233
00:09:43,467 --> 00:09:45,034
对他手里的画很感兴趣
who's very interested in the painting.

234
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,400
他要价多少?
How much is he asking?

235
00:09:46,467 --> 00:09:47,534
十万美金
$100,000.

236
00:09:50,834 --> 00:09:53,300
Neal 我们已经安排好
We've arranged to have the exchange happen

237
00:09:53,367 --> 00:09:54,667
在画廊进行交易了
at the gallery, Neal.

238
00:09:54,734 --> 00:09:56,267
Jones 咱们得好好准备一下
Jones, let's get a prep.

239
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:02,267
这一定会很有趣的
This should be fun.

240
00:10:05,434 --> 00:10:06,567
怎么了?
What?

241
00:10:06,634 --> 00:10:08,701
你有没有遇到过哪个女人对你不...
Have you ever met a woman who didn't...

242
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,634
有啊 Brittni... Brittni Nichole...
Brittni... Brittni Nichole...

243
00:10:10,701 --> 00:10:12,133
在二年级的时候
in second grade.

244
00:10:14,034 --> 00:10:15,100
那时候我有牙缝
I had a gap in my teeth.

245
00:10:59,767 --> 00:11:02,201
周五中午 在这里见面

246
00:11:03,867 --> 00:11:05,701
Kate喜欢经典的东西
Kate loves the classics.

247
00:11:12,534 --> 00:11:14,634
那真的就是一大包要洗的衣服啊
That's a big load of laundry.

248
00:11:14,701 --> 00:11:16,901
是啊 这包东西刚卖了十二万美金
Yeah. It just sold for $120,000.

249
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:18,400
什么?
What?

250
00:11:18,467 --> 00:11:21,001
- 嘿 别碰!  - 怎么了?
- Hey, hey!  - What?

251
00:11:21,068 --> 00:11:22,467
你永远不能给艺术品标价
Can't put a price on art.

252
00:11:22,534 --> 00:11:25,001
确实不能 所以我才觉得以二百六十万的价格
No, you can't, which is why I think $2.6 million

253
00:11:25,068 --> 00:11:27,434
卖豪斯滕伯格的画也太贵了
is a little steep for the Haustenberg.

254
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,400
你不是特别喜欢豪斯滕伯格的作品吧?
You're not a fan of Haustenberg?

255
00:11:29,467 --> 00:11:30,567
呃 我不知道
Uh, I don't know.

256
00:11:30,634 --> 00:11:33,334
对于我来说 他的画有点太卡通了
It's a little cartoony for my taste.

257
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,133
你... 你真是个俗人
You're... you're a philistine.

258
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,434
好吧 好吧
Yeah, yeah.

259
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,734
我... 我才是疯子
I... I'm the crazy one.

260
00:11:38,801 --> 00:11:40,200
- 都装好了吗?  - 装好了
- You all set?  - All set.

261
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:42,934
咱们去装窃听器吧
Well, let's get wired.

262
00:11:45,068 --> 00:11:47,734
十万现金... 那可是不少钱呢
100 grand in cash... that's a lot of money.

263
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,367
有诱惑力吗?
Tempted?

264
00:11:52,634 --> 00:11:54,334
你为什么这么想?
Why would you think that?

265
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,001
Peter警告我小心你
Peter warned me about you.

266
00:11:56,068 --> 00:11:58,167
警告你?
Warned you?

267
00:11:58,233 --> 00:12:00,634
听起来挺危险的嘛
Sounds ominous.

268
00:12:00,701 --> 00:12:02,867
- 有吗?  - 有啊
- Does it?  - Yeah.

269
00:12:02,934 --> 00:12:05,901
你是刚从监狱里出来吗?
Is it true you just got out of prison?

270
00:12:05,968 --> 00:12:07,534
我看起来像是刚从监狱里出来的吗?
Do I look like I just got out of prison?

271
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:08,834
他说了你会这样的
He said you'd do that.

272
00:12:08,901 --> 00:12:10,001
哪样?
What?

273
00:12:10,068 --> 00:12:11,834
反问
Redirect.

274
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,334
是 我是刚从监狱里出来
Yes, I just got out of prison,

275
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,334
也是Peter把我送进去的
yes, Peter is the guy who put me there,

276
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,801
而且没错...
and, yes...

277
00:12:20,867 --> 00:12:21,934
这钱确实很诱惑
I'm tempted.

278
00:12:24,567 --> 00:12:26,400
你真的是为了一个女孩才越狱的吗?
Is it true you escaped for a girl?

279
00:12:28,167 --> 00:12:30,567
有人说我个浪漫的人
Some people think I'm a romantic.

280
00:12:30,634 --> 00:12:31,701
她这么觉得吗?
Did she?

281
00:12:32,934 --> 00:12:34,867
我以后再告诉你
I'll let you know.

282
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:38,334
我们看见Dorsett穿过了第20街
We got Dorsett crossing 20th.

283
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,267
把画面切过去
Let's get a camera on that.

284
00:12:40,334 --> 00:12:41,400
看到了
Okay.

285
00:12:41,467 --> 00:12:43,034
他们正在往画廊走
They're approaching the gallery.

286
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,034
第一分队盯紧点
Team one has the eye.

287
00:12:51,968 --> 00:12:53,200
很高兴再次见到你
Good to see you again.

288
00:12:53,267 --> 00:12:54,467
我也很高兴见到您
Good to see you.

289
00:12:54,534 --> 00:12:58,267
我电话里说的就是他 Devore先生
As I said on the phone, this is Mr. Devore.

290
00:12:58,334 --> 00:13:01,068
叫我George就好
Call me George.

291
00:13:09,834 --> 00:13:11,767
这画比我想象的小啊
It's smaller than I expected.

292
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:14,267
你见过"蒙娜丽莎"吗? 那幅画更小
Have you seen the "Mona Lisa"? It's tiny.

293
00:13:15,801 --> 00:13:17,601
我能看看钱在哪里吗?
Could I see the money, please?

294
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:22,500
我来做鉴定吧
I'd like to authenticate it.

295
00:13:24,767 --> 00:13:27,001
你们两个认识很久了?
So, you two have known each other for a long time?

296
00:13:27,068 --> 00:13:30,068
我们认识了 我都不记得了 有多久了?
We've been friends for, I don't know, how long's it been?

297
00:13:30,133 --> 00:13:31,267
很多年了
Years.

298
00:13:31,334 --> 00:13:34,267
两位才貌出众 一定不只是朋友吧
Beautiful people are never just friends.

299
00:13:34,334 --> 00:13:36,734
George有女朋友
George has a girlfriend.

300
00:13:36,801 --> 00:13:40,500
又一次证明了一夫一妻制是美人的不幸
Again, monogamy is the great casualty of beauty.

301
00:13:40,567 --> 00:13:42,434
不一定吧
Not always.

302
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,734
真的
Please.

303
00:13:43,801 --> 00:13:45,801
我们用"蝴蝶"形容
We use the expression "butterfly"

304
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:48,200
到处拈花惹草的男人
for a man who flits from flower to flower.

305
00:13:48,267 --> 00:13:52,068
您这样一表人才 肯定在这方面很成功吧
A man such as yourself could be quite a successful butterfly.

306
00:13:52,133 --> 00:13:55,767
我们觉得蝴蝶是一种脆弱的生物
We consider butterflies weak, delicate creatures.

307
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:58,901
是啊 但是蝴蝶扇一扇翅膀 就能引起一场飓风呢
Yes, but flap their wings, and they can set off hurricanes.

308
00:13:58,968 --> 00:14:00,734
你真会说话 可以写本书了
That's beautiful. You should write a book.

309
00:14:00,801 --> 00:14:02,901
- 我们...  - 请把门关上
- Can we...  - Close the doors, please.

310
00:14:04,367 --> 00:14:06,834
我也有个女朋友
I have a girlfriend myself.

311
00:14:06,901 --> 00:14:08,434
她对你忠诚吗?
Is she faithful?

312
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,034
她也是法国人 我尽量不去想这个问题
She's French. I try not to think about it.

313
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,734
Brigitte昨晚刚到这里
Brigitte arrived last night,

314
00:14:17,801 --> 00:14:20,334
我不应该让她一个人在陌生的城市里待太久
and I shouldn't leave her alone in a new town for long.

315
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,100
我们可不可以快点
Perhaps we could hurry.

316
00:14:22,167 --> 00:14:23,734
当然 请关下灯
Of course. Lights, please.

317
00:14:33,233 --> 00:14:36,267
荧光下 画面上显示出来了镉绿色和石青蓝色
I've got fluorescing cadmium green and azurite blue.

318
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:38,701
证明这幅画的创作时间早于六十年代
That puts the paint composition pre-1960.

319
00:14:38,767 --> 00:14:40,001
你能不能解释一下
Perhaps you can explain

320
00:14:40,068 --> 00:14:42,334
外面的人为什么互相打暗号
why there are people signaling each other outside.

321
00:14:43,567 --> 00:14:45,068
我们过去吗?
You want us to go?

322
00:14:45,133 --> 00:14:47,367
现在还不行 太冒险了
Not yet. We can't risk it.

323
00:14:47,434 --> 00:14:49,734
他们是什么人?
Who are they?

324
00:14:49,801 --> 00:14:51,567
要是你把联邦调查局的人引来这里...
If you brought the FBI into this...

325
00:14:51,634 --> 00:14:53,034
我才没有!
It was not me!

326
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,467
我告诉你低调行事
I told you to keep a low profile.

327
00:14:54,534 --> 00:14:55,867
你们太不小心了
You were careless.

328
00:14:55,934 --> 00:14:57,434
你们带着这幅画满城招摇
You've been flashing this painting all over town.

329
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,367
他们当然是跟着你们来的
They followed you here.

330
00:14:59,834 --> 00:15:01,634
这里面肯定有问题
Something is not right here.

331
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:03,534
当然有问题
Damn right it's not.

332
00:15:03,601 --> 00:15:05,701
我浪费了时间和精力 钱我拿走了
For my time and inconvenience.

333
00:15:07,634 --> 00:15:09,767
好了 快行动 行动!
That's it. Move, move!

334
00:15:09,834 --> 00:15:11,534
第一分队 第二分队注意
Team one, team two, alpha bravo is exiting

335
00:15:11,601 --> 00:15:12,968
目标正从建筑物后方逃离... 快行动
the rear of the building... move in.

336
00:15:20,167 --> 00:15:21,934
快! 快!
Go! Go!

337
00:15:22,001 --> 00:15:24,068
跟上! 跟着Jones!
Go! Follow Jones!

338
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:25,100
你没事吧?
You okay?

339
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:26,334
我们都没事
We're fine.

340
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,367
把他们带走
Arrest them.

341
00:15:28,434 --> 00:15:30,834
带走他们 别让他们暴露了
Arrest them. We have to keep their cover.

342
00:15:30,901 --> 00:15:32,334
戴上手铐 宣读条约 一切按规矩走
Handcuff them. Read them their rights, everything.

343
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,467
你们俩去北边 和Jones分开走!
You two are on the north end, opposite side of Jones!

344
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:35,367
快!
Go!

345
00:15:36,734 --> 00:15:37,901
他们在哪?
Where are they?

346
00:15:37,968 --> 00:15:39,601
在楼群中跑了
They disappeared between the buildings.

347
00:15:39,667 --> 00:15:40,767
有人看到他们吗?
Anyone have eyes?

348
00:15:40,834 --> 00:15:42,901
没有
Negative.

349
00:15:42,968 --> 00:15:44,200
我们只找到了这个
All we got is this.

350
00:15:44,267 --> 00:15:45,367
什么?
What?

351
00:15:45,434 --> 00:15:47,968
他们换衣服了 真可恶!
Ah, they switched clothes. Damn it!

352
00:15:51,734 --> 00:15:53,867
你参与的任务都这么好玩吗?
Are things always this interesting when you're around?

353
00:15:55,634 --> 00:15:56,834
过来吧
Come on.

354
00:15:56,901 --> 00:15:58,734
你被捕了
You're under arrest.

355
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:13,067
你弄丢了十万美金 他们有多生气?
So, how upset were they that you lost the 100 grand?

356
00:16:13,134 --> 00:16:15,667
"生气"这个词都不足以形容了
"Upset" is a bit of an understatement.

357
00:16:15,734 --> 00:16:18,334
他们已经开始了针对我的行政调查
It started an administrative inquiry.

358
00:16:18,401 --> 00:16:21,267
不过只要我能把钱找回来就没事了...
Everything will be fine if I recover it...

359
00:16:21,334 --> 00:16:22,934
还是等我找回来再说吧
when I recover it.

360
00:16:23,001 --> 00:16:26,401
好吧 幸好钱不是Neal拿的
Well, the good news is Neal didn't take it.

361
00:16:26,468 --> 00:16:27,533
是啊
Yeah.

362
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,967
算是有点进步
This is progress.

363
00:16:30,034 --> 00:16:32,434
你觉得他和这事有什么关系吗?
Do you think he actually had anything to do with it?

364
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,967
没有 但是Neal这个人...
No, but the thing about Neal...

365
00:16:35,034 --> 00:16:37,468
我从来都看不清他的真实面目
nothing is ever what it seems.

366
00:16:37,533 --> 00:16:38,934
他本来就是个矛盾体
The guy's a contradiction.

367
00:16:39,001 --> 00:16:40,334
一边对Kate不能自拔
He's obsessed about Kate,

368
00:16:40,401 --> 00:16:41,867
另一边又和
But you should have seen him

369
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:43,934
遇到的女人打情骂俏
flirting with this girl at the takedown.

370
00:16:44,001 --> 00:16:45,368
亲爱的 Neal就是这样的人
Well, honey, that's who Neal is.

371
00:16:45,434 --> 00:16:46,667
本性难移嘛
That's never gonna change.

372
00:16:46,734 --> 00:16:48,468
所以我才这么爱你
That's what I love about you so much.

373
00:16:48,533 --> 00:16:51,767
怎么 结婚之后我就不会勾搭女人了吗?
What, that I lost all ability to flirt when we got married?

374
00:16:51,834 --> 00:16:54,734
- 亲爱的 结婚之前你也不太会  - 那倒是
- Honey, it was even questionable then.  - It was

375
00:16:54,901 --> 00:16:56,001
那个女孩是谁?
Who's the new girl?

376
00:16:56,067 --> 00:16:57,134
她叫Taryn Vandersant
Taryn Vandersant.

377
00:16:57,201 --> 00:16:58,234
我不认识她
Don't know her.

378
00:16:58,301 --> 00:17:00,600
她是Lambert画廊的顾客
She's a buyer at the Lambert gallery.

379
00:17:00,667 --> 00:17:02,500
挺漂亮的 看起来人也不错
She's beautiful, seems nice.

380
00:17:02,567 --> 00:17:04,800
如果Neal喜欢的话 你应该鼓励鼓励他
Well, if Neal's interested, you should encourage it.

381
00:17:04,867 --> 00:17:07,134
鼓励他? 我疯了吧
Encourage it? Oh, I need that like a hole in the head.

382
00:17:07,201 --> 00:17:08,900
亲爱的 要是他能爱上另外一个女孩
Honey, if he would fall for the new girl,

383
00:17:08,967 --> 00:17:10,368
说不定就真的不会再去找Kate了呢
he might actually stop chasing Kate.

384
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,401
- 爱你  - 我也爱你
- Love you.  - Love you.

385
00:17:21,267 --> 00:17:24,434
昨天你和Taryn相处得不错嘛
You and Taryn were getting along pretty good yesterday.

386
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,667
她不是我的菜
She's not my type.

387
00:17:25,734 --> 00:17:27,967
什么? 不是你的... 为什么不是你喜欢的类型?
What? Not your... why isn't she your type?

388
00:17:28,034 --> 00:17:29,301
她喜欢艺术
She loves art.

389
00:17:29,368 --> 00:17:30,767
她看起来就像是穿着卡其色衣服的劳拉・克劳馥(古墓丽影中角色)
She looks like Lara Croft in khakis.

390
00:17:30,834 --> 00:17:32,600
是吗? 她是不是还给孤儿们烤饼干?
Really? Does she bake cookies for orphans, too?

391
00:17:32,667 --> 00:17:33,700
是啊
She does.

392
00:17:35,201 --> 00:17:36,334
我懂了
I get it.

393
00:17:36,401 --> 00:17:38,867
要是我遇到喜欢的女孩 也许就能安定下来
Meet a nice girl, maybe settle down.

394
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:41,101
我就能省点心了 你也一样
Simplify my life, probably save yours.

395
00:17:41,167 --> 00:17:42,934
你在饼干的事上肯定没说实话
You're lying about the cookies.

396
00:17:43,001 --> 00:17:43,967
你怎么证明
Prove it.

397
00:17:45,301 --> 00:17:46,434
那人是谁?
Who's that?

398
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,368
钱宁博物馆的馆长
Curator from the Channing Museum.

399
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:49,401
什么?
What?

400
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:50,700
他... 他来这干嘛?
Why... why is he here?

401
00:17:50,767 --> 00:17:53,167
为了豪斯滕伯格那幅画来的 他说那幅画是他们馆藏的
The Haustenberg. He says it belongs to them.

402
00:17:53,234 --> 00:17:54,734
把帽子摘了
Lose the stupid hat.

403
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,800
这幅画丢失的时候 钱宁博物馆为什么没有上报?
How come the Channing didn't report it missing?

404
00:17:58,867 --> 00:18:02,600
当时我们确实上报了 不过那是在1967年
We did report it, when it was stolen in 1967.

405
00:18:02,667 --> 00:18:03,967
我有个问题
I have a question.

406
00:18:04,034 --> 00:18:06,134
画是在67年被偷的
The painting was stolen in '67,

407
00:18:06,201 --> 00:18:08,533
那为什么失踪艺术品登记处的名录上没有它
but it's not listed on the art-loss registry.

408
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,468
那个登记处是1990年才建立的
The registry was established in 1990.

409
00:18:10,533 --> 00:18:11,633
其实是91年
'91, actually.

410
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,267
你可以重新登记的
You could have re-filed the claim.

411
00:18:13,334 --> 00:18:15,867
不好意思 你是哪位?
I'm sorry. You are who?

412
00:18:15,934 --> 00:18:19,001
Neal Caffrey 他是我们的艺术顾问
Neal Caffrey. He's one of our art consultants.

413
00:18:19,067 --> 00:18:20,067
叫Caffrey啊
Caffrey.

414
00:18:20,134 --> 00:18:22,967
我可没听说过这个人
Not familiar with that name.

415
00:18:23,034 --> 00:18:24,567
幸好你没听说过
It's probably for the best.

416
00:18:24,633 --> 00:18:26,001
你是研究豪斯滕伯格作品的专家?
You're an expert on Haustenberg?

417
00:18:26,067 --> 00:18:28,468
我了解近代欧洲后印象派的所有画家
All the late European post-impressionists.

418
00:18:28,533 --> 00:18:31,201
"戴项链的年轻女孩"进馆时 
I authenticated "young girl with locket" myself

419
00:18:31,267 --> 00:18:32,667
是我亲自做的鉴定
when it first entered our collection.

420
00:18:32,734 --> 00:18:34,900
的确是杰出的作品
You'll agree it's an excellent work,

421
00:18:34,967 --> 00:18:37,734
我觉得这画过于伤感了
a bit sentimental for my taste,

422
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,800
很显然是受到了马蒂斯的影响
but the Matisse influence is apparent.

423
00:18:40,867 --> 00:18:42,767
哦 鉴于马蒂斯是野兽派
Oh, well, considering Matisse was a Fauvist,

424
00:18:42,834 --> 00:18:43,967
你这么说我无法赞同
I wouldn't agree with that at all.

425
00:18:44,034 --> 00:18:45,600
除非你是在说他的早期作品
Unless you're talking about his early work,

426
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:47,301
我觉得你肯定没关注过 如果关注过 你那么说就大错特错了
which I don't think you are, and if you are, you're just wrong.

427
00:18:47,368 --> 00:18:49,334
我们有理由相信
We have reason to believe that 

428
00:18:49,401 --> 00:18:50,633
它在一次入室抢劫中丢失了
this was taken in a residential robbery.

429
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,001
我并不关心这幅画
What happened to the painting

430
00:18:52,067 --> 00:18:55,101
从我的博物馆丢失以后的去向
when it was taken from my museum is not my concern.

431
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:58,468
现在有人想买回被窃之物
Now, someone elected to buy stolen property.

432
00:18:58,533 --> 00:19:01,334
我认为那也是犯罪
I believe that is a crime.

433
00:19:04,001 --> 00:19:05,633
你知不知道豪斯腾伯格这幅画
Do you know how the Haustenberg

434
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,767
是怎么到你祖母手里的?
came into your grandmother's possession?

435
00:19:07,834 --> 00:19:09,667
她在战后从匈牙利
She brought it with her from Hungary

436
00:19:09,734 --> 00:19:11,767
来到这座城市时就带着它了
when she came to this country after the war.

437
00:19:11,834 --> 00:19:12,967
怎么了?
Why?

438
00:19:13,034 --> 00:19:14,301
Burke探员 打扰一下
Agent Burke, got a question for you.

439
00:19:14,368 --> 00:19:15,434
好的
Yeah.

440
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,134
请原谅
Excuse me.

441
00:19:17,201 --> 00:19:18,500
好好表现 小子
Play nice, kids.

442
00:19:25,468 --> 00:19:26,700
这是怎么了?
What's going on?

443
00:19:31,934 --> 00:19:33,401
你不擅长撒谎啊
You're not a very good liar.

444
00:19:33,468 --> 00:19:35,167
那幅画是你祖母偷来的
Your grandmother stole the painting.

445
00:19:35,234 --> 00:19:36,567
你为什么这么说?
Why would you say that?

446
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,101
她从未给这幅画买过保险
She never had it insured.

447
00:19:38,167 --> 00:19:39,600
这是线索一
That was my first clue.

448
00:19:39,667 --> 00:19:42,067
你俩这是在表演红脸白脸吗?
Is this like a good-cop, bad-cop thing?

449
00:19:42,134 --> 00:19:44,067
他去接电话 你来搞怀柔
He takes a call. You wink at me.

450
00:19:44,134 --> 00:19:46,667
就算我们拿回那幅画 也要还给钱宁博物馆
If we get the painting, it's going back to the Channing,

451
00:19:46,734 --> 00:19:48,934
除非你给我个合适的理由不让他们拿回去
Unless you give us a good reason to keep it away from them.

452
00:19:52,368 --> 00:19:54,533
行了 跟我说说吧
All right. Tell me a story.

453
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,234
她是怎么弄到画的?
How did she take it?

454
00:19:56,301 --> 00:19:58,934
假设一下就好
Just... hypothetically.

455
00:19:59,001 --> 00:20:00,468
假设?
Hypothetically?

456
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:05,201
小黑裙 一瓶系着蕾丝带的威士忌 
A little black dress, a laced bottle of whiskey,

457
00:20:05,267 --> 00:20:07,368
还有一个好色的爱尔兰保安
and a horny Irish security guard.

458
00:20:07,434 --> 00:20:09,434
她干嘛要那么做?
Why'd she do it?

459
00:20:16,334 --> 00:20:18,567
这是画里的吊坠
That's the locket.

460
00:20:18,633 --> 00:20:21,201
你祖母就是画里的小女孩
Your grandmother's the little girl in the painting.

461
00:20:34,134 --> 00:20:35,567
情况怎么样?
How's it going in there?

462
00:20:35,633 --> 00:20:37,001
呃 还好吧
Oh, it's... it's fine.

463
00:20:37,067 --> 00:20:38,633
- 找到Dorsett了吗?  - 没有
- Any luck on Dorsett? - No.

464
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,267
想像一下你怀揣十万美元和那幅画
Assuming you just walked with 100 grand in cash

465
00:20:41,334 --> 00:20:43,167
你会怎么做?
and the painting, what do you do?

466
00:20:43,234 --> 00:20:44,667
躲起来等风头过去
Go to ground till things cool off.

467
00:20:44,734 --> 00:20:46,533
你会躲在哪里?
Where do you go?

468
00:20:47,867 --> 00:20:50,334
Dorsett说过他有个女朋友
Dorsett said something about having a girlfriend.

469
00:20:50,401 --> 00:20:51,633
- Brigitte  - 没错
- Brigitte. - Yeah.

470
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,401
昨晚有多少叫Brigitte的法国人入境?
How many Brigittes came in from France last night?

471
00:20:54,468 --> 00:20:57,334
包括中间名和拼写变化的
Accounting for middle names and spelling variations,

472
00:20:57,401 --> 00:20:59,001
比我想象中多得多
a lot more than I thought.

473
00:20:59,067 --> 00:21:01,267
嗯 可以忽略中转航班的
Well, we can discount connecting flights.

474
00:21:01,334 --> 00:21:02,368
以及50岁以上的
And women over 50.

475
00:21:02,434 --> 00:21:04,967
告诉我我错了
Tell me I'm wrong.

476
00:21:05,034 --> 00:21:06,667
嗯 这就剩下七个了
Well, that leaves seven.

477
00:21:06,734 --> 00:21:08,267
很好
All right.

478
00:21:08,334 --> 00:21:10,267
好了 弄些人手来 一组盯一个Brigitte
So, let's pull in some teams, and everybody take a Brigitte.

479
00:21:10,334 --> 00:21:13,401
我们... 我们盯那个住在甘斯沃尔特的(以艳遇著名的酒店)
We'll...  we'll take the girl staying at the Gansevoort.

480
00:21:13,468 --> 00:21:15,167
要是我就会住那里
That's where I'd stay.

481
00:21:20,633 --> 00:21:24,434
为什么不用卫星什么的处理这种事
You'd think they'd have a satellite for things like this.

482
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,533
卫星能告诉我们的只有一点
The only thing a satellite is gonna tell us

483
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,067
他没在屋顶上
is that he's not on the roof.

484
00:21:28,134 --> 00:21:29,034
这是传统方法
This is old-school.

485
00:21:29,101 --> 00:21:30,600
"传统方法"
"Old-school".

486
00:21:30,667 --> 00:21:32,267
你放松点好吗?
Will you relax?

487
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:33,900
你常冥想吗?
You meditate?

488
00:21:33,967 --> 00:21:35,600
- 没有啊  - 真的?
- No.  - Really?

489
00:21:35,667 --> 00:21:37,633
你这样子好像常冥想的样子
You look like a guy who meditates.

490
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,001
三明治?
Sandwich?

491
00:21:42,533 --> 00:21:43,667
什么味道啊?
What is that smell?

492
00:21:43,734 --> 00:21:45,267
辣味烤火腿
That's deviled ham.

493
00:21:45,334 --> 00:21:46,334
- 不要!  - 尝点
- No!  - Come on.

494
00:21:46,401 --> 00:21:48,267
不!
No!

495
00:21:54,167 --> 00:21:56,267
不 别 调回去听比赛
No. Wait. Go back to the game.

496
00:21:56,334 --> 00:21:57,867
不 这是我点的
No, I called it.

497
00:21:57,934 --> 00:21:59,867
你不过是按按钮而已 那不叫点歌
You were just touching the buttons. That's not calling it.

498
00:21:59,934 --> 00:22:01,201
能不这么孩子气吗?
What are we, 12?

499
00:22:01,267 --> 00:22:02,734
也许吧
I guess we are.

500
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,633
如果这是你的车 我们就听你选的台
When we're in your car, we can listen to your station.

501
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,067
我没车
I don't have a car.

502
00:22:07,134 --> 00:22:08,434
可悲的人生之路
Poor life choice.

503
00:22:11,434 --> 00:22:13,834
还是听比赛
And we got the game.

504
00:22:19,234 --> 00:22:21,734
你觉你能负担得起在那消费吗?
What do you think you can afford in that place?

505
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,034
给我20块
Spot me a $20.

506
00:22:23,101 --> 00:22:26,067
干嘛不用你的新信用卡 金卡嘛?
Why don't you use your new gold card to get it?

507
00:22:27,368 --> 00:22:28,867
你怎么知道的?
You know about that?

508
00:22:31,001 --> 00:22:33,434
留着吧 可以让我掌握你都买了些什么东西
Keep it. It makes it easier for me to know what you're buying.

509
00:22:40,934 --> 00:22:42,500
喔
Oh.

510
00:22:42,567 --> 00:22:45,734
好吧 去吧 别耍花样
All right, go, but no Shenanigans.

511
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,500
十分钟 手机开着
You've got 10 minutes. And keep your phone on.

512
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:50,101
送给你的
That's for you.

513
00:23:36,034 --> 00:23:37,034
打扰一下

514
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,567
你们讲法语吗?

515
00:23:40,633 --> 00:23:42,201
可以请你们喝一杯吗?
Can I buy you a drink?

516
00:23:51,434 --> 00:23:52,368
嘿!
Hey!

517
00:23:52,434 --> 00:23:54,234
怎么?
What?

518
00:23:57,001 --> 00:23:58,234
你觉得怎么样?
What do you think?

519
00:23:58,301 --> 00:24:00,301
妓女吗?
Hookers?

520
00:24:00,368 --> 00:24:01,067
不是
No.

521
00:24:01,134 --> 00:24:03,134
那是Brigitte和她的朋友
That's Brigitte and her friend.

522
00:24:03,201 --> 00:24:04,667
我说服她们带我们去她们那儿
I convinced them to invite us up to their suite.

523
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:06,101
Brigitte喜欢我 Claire是你的
Brigitte likes me. You can have Claire.

524
00:24:06,167 --> 00:24:08,533
你疯了吧?
Are you completely out of your mind?

525
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,167
房间是以她的名义订的
The room is rented in her name.

526
00:24:11,234 --> 00:24:15,034
她请我们去 这又不违法
We're not breaking any laws if she invites us in.

527
00:24:15,101 --> 00:24:17,334
十万美元和那幅画说不定就在那里呢
The 100 grand and the painting could be inside.

528
00:24:17,401 --> 00:24:18,700
你难道不想知道
Wouldn't you like to know

529
00:24:18,767 --> 00:24:20,533
我们盯的这个到底是不是她吗?
if we're sitting in the right place?

530
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,201
对
Yeah.

531
00:24:24,167 --> 00:24:25,533
哪个是Claire?
Which one's Claire?

532
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,967
好
Ah, oui.

533
00:24:48,034 --> 00:24:49,401
Claire很可爱
Claire's cute.

534
00:24:49,468 --> 00:24:51,934
没错 现在她就是此时此刻我最需要的
Yeah. She's exactly what I need in my life right now.

535
00:24:54,067 --> 00:24:56,767
好了 没发现男式袜子
All right. There are no men's socks lying around.

536
00:24:56,834 --> 00:24:59,468
Brigitte看来一点都不担心
Brigitte does not look like a girl

537
00:24:59,533 --> 00:25:01,434
男朋友突然回来
who's worried about her boyfriend coming home.

538
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,934
Peter 你淡定点
Peter, you have to relax.

539
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,067
如果是找错了人 很快就会知道的
If we have the wrong Brigitte, we'll know soon enough.

540
00:25:05,134 --> 00:25:07,334
回到车里去 继续吃辣味火腿
Beats sitting in the car, eating deviled ham.

541
00:25:07,401 --> 00:25:08,800
好吧 好的
All right, fine.

542
00:25:08,867 --> 00:25:12,301
一旦发现Dorsett住在这里
The second we find out if Dorsett is staying here,

543
00:25:12,368 --> 00:25:14,368
我们马上离开 我来呼叫增援
we leave, and we call in reinforcements.

544
00:25:14,434 --> 00:25:15,401
没问题
Done.

545
00:25:15,468 --> 00:25:16,700
她们来了
They're coming.

546
00:25:19,967 --> 00:25:21,767
嗯
Hmm.

547
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,301
喝一点?
Voil?

548
00:25:28,334 --> 00:25:30,101
谢谢 非常感谢
Merci. Ah, merci beaucoup.

549
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,834
她不想让我们进那间屋
She doesn't want us in there.

550
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,201
没错 我看到她把门锁上了
Yeah, I saw her lock the door.

551
00:25:37,267 --> 00:25:38,834
卫生间肯定还有个门
I bet there's a door in the bathroom

552
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,368
通向主卧的
that connects to the master suite.

553
00:25:40,434 --> 00:25:41,500
我能打开
I can open it.

554
00:25:41,567 --> 00:25:42,533
不 不行
No, you can't.

555
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,767
- 我谁也不说  - 不行
- I won't tell anyone. - No, no.

556
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:45,700
你知道规矩的
You understand the rules here.

557
00:25:45,767 --> 00:25:47,101
听着 这我知道
Listen, I've heard the speech.

558
00:25:55,867 --> 00:25:57,101
什么?
What's that?

559
00:25:57,167 --> 00:25:58,434
她们想玩"输了脱"游戏
They want to play strip poker.

560
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,967
噢...
Oh...

561
00:26:00,034 --> 00:26:01,034
开玩笑的
I'm kidding.

562
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,800
但你幻想一下啊 多美妙?
But could you imagine?

563
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,468
她们要来点音乐 对吧?
They want music, all right?

564
00:26:06,533 --> 00:26:08,267
- 来吧 放松点  - 好吧
- Come on. Relax. - All right.

565
00:26:08,334 --> 00:26:10,034
在那边呢 去吧
It's over there. Come on.

566
00:26:12,067 --> 00:26:13,967
哦
Ooh.

567
00:26:25,034 --> 00:26:26,401
稍等片刻
Just un moment.

568
00:26:30,234 --> 00:26:31,934
Neal 我知道你想干嘛!
Neal, I know what you're doing!

569
00:26:32,001 --> 00:26:33,468
稍等片刻
Just un moment.

570
00:26:33,533 --> 00:26:35,167
别用法语说废话! 出来!
Cut the French crap! Get out here!

571
00:26:35,234 --> 00:26:36,301
吸引她们的注意
Keep them occupied.

572
00:26:36,368 --> 00:26:38,201
我没法吸引她们注意力!
I can't keep them occupied!

573
00:26:38,267 --> 00:26:40,401
我不会... 说法语!
I don't... speak French!

574
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,533
哇
Whoa.

575
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:51,633
喔!
Whoo!

576
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,401
知道吗? 我必须起来了
You know what? I should get up right now.

577
00:27:02,468 --> 00:27:03,800
我... 我做不到... 不行...
I... I can't... I can't do...

578
00:27:05,134 --> 00:27:06,401
葡萄不错
That's a good grape.

579
00:27:12,434 --> 00:27:13,834
啊!
Aah!

580
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,567
噢! 没事... 是手机响
Oh! It's just... It's just my phone.

581
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:16,867
我的手机
Just my phone.

582
00:27:16,934 --> 00:27:18,167
别怕 我拿一下手机
No, I'm just getting my phone.

583
00:27:18,234 --> 00:27:19,101
只是拿一下手机
I'm just getting it. That's all I'm doing.

584
00:27:19,167 --> 00:27:20,368
拿一下我的... 看到没?
Just getting my... see?

585
00:27:20,434 --> 00:27:21,434
不!
No!

586
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,001
不! 请别这样!
No! Please don't!

587
00:27:23,067 --> 00:27:24,368
让我... 让我接电话
Let's... let me have the phone.

588
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:26,101
把电话给我!
Give me the phone!

589
00:27:26,167 --> 00:27:27,533
谢谢
Thank you.

590
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,500
天啊 是El!
Oh, God, it's El!

591
00:27:30,533 --> 00:27:31,667
嗨
Hello.

592
00:27:31,734 --> 00:27:33,468
哦 嘿 我以为你不会接的
Oh, hey. I didn't think I was gonna get you.

593
00:27:33,533 --> 00:27:35,034
我只是给你留个信儿
I was actually gonna leave a message.

594
00:27:35,101 --> 00:27:36,533
嗯 是呀 好的
Oh, hi. Yeah. Well.

595
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,767
看到是你打来的当然要接了 怎么了?
Uh, saw that it was you. What's up?

596
00:27:38,834 --> 00:27:41,800
没事 刚和客户吃完晚餐回来
Nothing. I just got back from a client dinner.

597
00:27:41,867 --> 00:27:43,101
我想知道监视工作怎么样啦
I wanted to see how the stakeout was going.

598
00:27:43,167 --> 00:27:44,600
有突破性进展
Having a blast.

599
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,700
你在哪啊?
Where are you?

600
00:27:47,767 --> 00:27:49,201
我在... 我在...
I'm at a... I'm at a...

601
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:50,967
在夜店?
Are you at a nightclub?

602
00:27:51,034 --> 00:27:52,134
没错 就是在夜店
Yes, that's where I am.

603
00:27:52,201 --> 00:27:53,533
我们... 我们... 就是在夜店
We... we... we're at a nightclub.
607 

604
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,001
我们...我们跟踪他到了夜店
We... we followed him into a nightclub.

605
00:27:56,067 --> 00:27:57,334
在甘斯沃尔特?
At the Gansevoort?

606
00:27:57,401 --> 00:27:58,567
亲爱的 真棒
Wow, honey. I'm impressed.

607
00:27:58,633 --> 00:28:00,167
真没想到你到那儿去了
I can't believe you got in there.

608
00:28:00,234 --> 00:28:03,301
说来话长 El
It's a long story, El.

609
00:28:03,368 --> 00:28:06,468
El 我得走了 这里有点状况 好吗?
El, I've got to go. I've got a situation here, okay?

610
00:28:06,533 --> 00:28:07,600
我爱你 亲爱的!
I love you, honey!

611
00:28:07,667 --> 00:28:09,368
我爱你 这人很多
I love you. It's crowded.

612
00:28:09,434 --> 00:28:12,267
有点乱
It's crowded.

613
00:28:12,334 --> 00:28:14,434
嘿 Neal Caffrey!
Hey, Neal. Caffrey!

614
00:28:25,334 --> 00:28:27,167
Caffrey 我们... Caffrey!
Caffrey, we got... Caffrey!

615
00:28:50,434 --> 00:28:51,767
哦!
Oh!

616
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:59,034
"致最亲爱的Julianna 请永远留着它"
"to my dearest Julianna, keep this forever."

617
00:30:08,001 --> 00:30:10,434
我来跟Elizabeth谈吧 行吗? 让我弥补一下
Let me talk to Elizabeth, all right? It's the least I can do.

618
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,034
不 真想弥补就什么都别做
No, the least you can do is nothing,

619
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:13,401
必须什么都别做
which is exactly what you will do.

620
00:30:13,468 --> 00:30:14,600
都是我的错
It's my fault.

621
00:30:14,667 --> 00:30:16,600
不 我不许你骗我妻子
No, I don't need you to lie to my wife.

622
00:30:16,667 --> 00:30:17,800
你要自己骗她?
You gonna do it yourself?

623
00:30:17,867 --> 00:30:18,800
不
No.

624
00:30:18,867 --> 00:30:20,834
真相 Peter
The truth, Peter.

625
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,867
- 很冒险啊  - 假设一下...
- Bold choice. - Hypothetically ...

626
00:30:22,934 --> 00:30:25,167
听着 我来跟他说我一直不停抱怨你的车
See, I would tell her that I wouldn't stop complaining about the car,

627
00:30:25,234 --> 00:30:26,468
所以你就让我到夜店里去了
so you let me go into the nightclub,

628
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:28,034
你看到了嫌犯在我后面进去了
and you witnessed the suspect enter after me

629
00:30:28,101 --> 00:30:30,101
只有跟过来
and had no choice but to follow.

630
00:30:30,167 --> 00:30:31,567
跟事实差不多
It's almost the truth.

631
00:30:31,633 --> 00:30:33,234
总比离婚要好
It's better than alimony.

632
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,867
是
Yeah.

633
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:37,401
我们跟丢了Dorsett
We lost Dorsett.

634
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:39,167
糟糕...
God...

635
00:30:39,234 --> 00:30:40,900
画和现金呢?
What about the painting and the cash?

636
00:30:40,967 --> 00:30:42,001
都不见了
All gone.

637
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:47,101
Dorsett逃跑了
Dorsett escaped.

638
00:30:47,167 --> 00:30:48,434
糟糕了
This is bad.

639
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,034
对 是很糟糕
Yeah, this is bad.

640
00:30:53,301 --> 00:30:56,401
现在可能真成问题了 EL
You know, this one may be a real problem, El.

641
00:30:56,468 --> 00:30:58,600
所以要是你找不到Dorsett
So, if you don't find Dorsett,

642
00:30:58,667 --> 00:31:00,267
Neal怎么办?
what happens to Neal?

643
00:31:00,334 --> 00:31:02,800
他完了 重新回去坐牢
He's done. He's back inside.

644
00:31:02,867 --> 00:31:05,767
你觉得他真的偷了画吗?
Do you actually think he stole it?

645
00:31:05,834 --> 00:31:07,767
嗯
Yeah.

646
00:31:07,834 --> 00:31:09,334
嗯
Yeah.

647
00:31:10,633 --> 00:31:12,800
你没事吧?
You gonna be okay?

648
00:31:12,867 --> 00:31:16,900
我... 我没事 嗯
Yeah, I'll be... I'll be fine, yeah.

649
00:31:16,967 --> 00:31:18,767
亲爱的 听我说
Honey, listen.

650
00:31:18,834 --> 00:31:22,533
昨晚在酒店的事...
About last night at the hotel...

651
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,301
你说夜店吧
You mean the nightclub.

652
00:31:24,368 --> 00:31:25,468
对对
Yeah.

653
00:31:25,533 --> 00:31:27,800
呃...
Well...

654
00:31:27,867 --> 00:31:29,633
Neal 在抱怨我的三明治
Neal was complaining about my sandwich,

655
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,034
然后他就开始摆弄收音机 所以我...
and then he started fidgeting with the radio, so I ...

656
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:36,134
其实我们没去夜店
there was no nightclub.

657
00:31:36,201 --> 00:31:38,201
我明白
I know.

658
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,134
亲爱的 你觉得做夫妻都10多年了 我会不知道...
Honey, you don't think after 10 years I know when you're...

659
00:31:42,201 --> 00:31:43,667
我在夸大事实吗?
Stretching the truth?

660
00:31:43,734 --> 00:31:46,600
呃 这样也算吧
Well, that's a nice way of putting it.

661
00:31:46,667 --> 00:31:48,267
下次可以直接告诉我
Next time, just tell me.

662
00:31:48,334 --> 00:31:49,800
我跟Neal就这么说的
That's what I told Neal.

663
00:31:49,867 --> 00:31:50,867
那继续保持
Then stick to it.

664
00:31:52,034 --> 00:31:53,201
我会的
I will.

665
00:31:53,267 --> 00:31:55,368
我知道你是好男人
I know you're a good man.

666
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,167
她好看吗?
Was she cute?

667
00:32:00,234 --> 00:32:02,834
这个得看你怎么想了
Well, now, that depends on your definition,

668
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:06,401
因为我现在不想再说这事了
'cause I... I got to plead the fifth on this one.

669
00:32:06,468 --> 00:32:07,600
那好吧
Yeah, okay.

670
00:32:27,967 --> 00:32:29,101
你是哪位?
Who is this?

671
00:32:29,167 --> 00:32:31,334
我得问你才对
I could ask you the same thing.

672
00:32:31,401 --> 00:32:33,500
你好像有不少名字 George
You seem to have many names, George.

673
00:32:33,567 --> 00:32:34,600
你是Dorsett
Dorsett.

674
00:32:34,667 --> 00:32:35,334
你从哪弄到号码的?
How'd you get this number?

675
00:32:35,401 --> 00:32:38,167
你用信用卡给我女朋友买了杯酒
You bought my girlfriend a drink with your credit card.

676
00:32:38,234 --> 00:32:40,301
你的足智多谋让我印象很深刻
I'm impressed with your resourcefulness.

677
00:32:40,368 --> 00:32:42,334
现在让你见识见识我的本事了 我要那幅画
Now you will see mine. I want the painting.

678
00:32:42,401 --> 00:32:43,867
如果没还回来的话
If it is not returned,

679
00:32:43,934 --> 00:32:47,567
Joshua会去画廊好好拜访一下你的漂亮女友
Joshua will pay a visit to your beautiful friend at the gallery.

680
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:49,234
你别把她扯进来
You leave her out of this.

681
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:52,468
Brigitte本无牵连 但你把她扯进来了
Brigitte was out of bounds, yet you involved her.

682
00:32:52,533 --> 00:32:53,734
你制定了规则
You set the rules.

683
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,500
那你就得照着来玩
Now you must play by them.

684
00:32:55,567 --> 00:32:56,667
给我两天
I need two days.

685
00:32:56,734 --> 00:32:57,867
你只有两天时间
That's all you have.

686
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:06,167
你偷了那幅画?
You stole the painting?

687
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:08,600
我打算还给Julianna
I was going to give it back to Julianna.

688
00:33:08,667 --> 00:33:11,368
你怎么这么孩子气... 不考虑后果
You're like a child... No sense of consequence.

689
00:33:11,434 --> 00:33:13,500
好吧 你看到这里的题字吗?
Okay. Will you look at the inscription?

690
00:33:15,867 --> 00:33:18,067
钱宁馆长说他在这幅画被偷之前
The Channing curator said he authenticated the painting

691
00:33:18,134 --> 00:33:19,267
就验过了
before it was stolen.

692
00:33:19,334 --> 00:33:20,900
他看到了这幅画该归Julianna
He saw that it belonged to Julianna

693
00:33:20,967 --> 00:33:22,434
但却视而不见
and chose to ignore it.

694
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,867
所以你就来做罗宾汉
And you're Robin Hood.

695
00:33:23,934 --> 00:33:25,667
我有没有忘了告诉你
And did I forget to mention the part

696
00:33:25,734 --> 00:33:27,201
是你"偷"了这幅画啊?!  
where you stole the painting?!

697
00:33:27,267 --> 00:33:29,001
我没料到Dorsett会逃跑
I didn't think Dorsett would get away.

698
00:33:29,067 --> 00:33:31,767
那是因为你不喜欢博物馆里的人
This is because you don't like the guy from the Channing.

699
00:33:31,834 --> 00:33:33,101
你因为有成见才这么做
You did this for spite.

700
00:33:33,167 --> 00:33:34,600
我尽量克制自己了
I've done things for less.

701
00:33:34,667 --> 00:33:37,567
我不能让他去骚扰Taryn
I can't let him go after Taryn.

702
00:33:37,633 --> 00:33:39,967
那你要怎么做?
So, what are you gonna do?

703
00:33:45,201 --> 00:33:47,967
最好是好消息
This better be good.

704
00:33:50,234 --> 00:33:51,500
我拿了那幅画
I took the painting.

705
00:33:51,567 --> 00:33:53,434
该死 Neal
Damn it, Neal.

706
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,234
我没打算...
I wasn't gonna...

707
00:33:55,301 --> 00:33:56,700
我是为...
I did it for...

708
00:33:59,567 --> 00:34:02,500
我能用它抓来Dorsett 他不知道我替你干活
I can use it to catch Dorsett. He doesn't know I work for you.

709
00:34:09,234 --> 00:34:10,368
我们明天再说
We'll set it up tomorrow.

710
00:34:12,667 --> 00:34:13,967
现在从我家滚出去
Now get the hell out of my house.

711
00:34:14,034 --> 00:34:15,368
好的
Okay.

712
00:34:18,368 --> 00:34:19,368
再见 Elisabeth
Good night Elisabeth.

713
00:34:19,434 --> 00:34:21,368
拜拜 Neal
Bye, Neal.

714
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,734
呃 他...
Well, he, uh...

715
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,301
跟你说了偷画的事实
told you the truth about the painting.

716
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:36,600
嗯 因为他们拿Taryn来威胁他
Mm-hmm. Because they threatened Taryn.

717
00:34:38,734 --> 00:34:40,700
这是个开始
It's a start.

718
00:34:40,767 --> 00:34:42,067
嗯
Yeah.

719
00:34:42,134 --> 00:34:43,834
的确是个开始
It's a start.

720
00:34:56,767 --> 00:35:00,067
你知道你完全无法克制冲动
You know you have absolutely no impulse control.

721
00:35:00,134 --> 00:35:01,667
把鹅黄的颜料给我
Hand me the Naples yellow.

722
00:35:05,533 --> 00:35:08,134
豪斯腾伯格的笔法非常流畅
Haustenberg's brushwork is much more fluid.

723
00:35:08,201 --> 00:35:09,533
但你的却坑坑洼洼的
You're being choppy.

724
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,234
哪有 我的笔法没问题
Nah. My brushwork's fine.

725
00:35:13,201 --> 00:35:15,667
这是可以骗过普通游客
This could trick the occasional tourist,

726
00:35:15,734 --> 00:35:18,533
但钱宁博物馆馆长可不是等闲之辈
but this guy at the Channing will not be fooled.

727
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,633
我相信他不是
I'm sure he won't.

728
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,001
这颜料要做旧
This pigment needs to be aged.

729
00:35:26,368 --> 00:35:27,667
我去加热烤箱
I'll go preheat the oven.

730
00:35:27,734 --> 00:35:29,101
- 125度  - 明白 明白
- It's 125.  - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

731
00:35:29,167 --> 00:35:30,567
我知道怎么给画做旧
I know how to age a painting.

732
00:36:13,134 --> 00:36:15,134
我的缓刑还靠谱吗?
How tenuous is my probation?

733
00:36:15,201 --> 00:36:16,401
很难说
It's pretty thin.

734
00:36:16,468 --> 00:36:17,700
就看这次了
We need this one.

735
00:36:17,767 --> 00:36:19,001
很简单 对吧?
It's simple, right?

736
00:36:19,067 --> 00:36:21,334
对 所以别搞复杂了
Yeah, so don't make it complicated.

737
00:36:21,401 --> 00:36:23,067
快点把Dorsett拿下
Take Dorsett down quickly.

738
00:36:23,134 --> 00:36:24,334
要是我抓到他 你会再相信我吗?
If I get him, you trust me again?

739
00:36:24,401 --> 00:36:26,934
是的 同志
Yeah, comrade.

740
00:36:27,001 --> 00:36:28,368
你还要再验证?
You still gonna verify?

741
00:36:28,434 --> 00:36:29,800
嗯 对
Oh, yeah.

742
00:36:32,767 --> 00:36:33,734
到了
Here we go.

743
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,368
真了不起你还有胆子自己来
Surprised you had the guts to come yourself.

744
00:36:44,434 --> 00:36:45,967
这不是胆量
It's not bravery.

745
00:36:46,034 --> 00:36:49,368
Joshua带着一幅一百万美元的画我不放心
I simply don't trust Joshua with a million-dollar painting.

746
00:36:49,434 --> 00:36:51,468
这样活着不容易吧?
Is it hard to live like that,

747
00:36:51,533 --> 00:36:54,101
连最亲近的人都不敢相信
not trusting the people closest to you?

748
00:36:54,167 --> 00:36:56,500
大概吧 但钱归我了
I suppose, but I'll take the money.

749
00:36:56,567 --> 00:36:57,734
你赢了
You won.

750
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,468
对啊 是个好游戏
Yes, but it was a good game.

751
00:37:02,401 --> 00:37:04,067
联邦调查局! 你被捕了!
FBI! You're under arrest!

752
00:37:04,134 --> 00:37:06,201
把手举起来让我们看见! 把画给我!
Hands where I can see them! Give me the painting!

753
00:37:35,967 --> 00:37:37,667
豪斯腾伯格是她的父亲
Haustenberg was her father.

754
00:37:37,734 --> 00:37:39,101
对
Yes.

755
00:37:39,167 --> 00:37:41,633
她是他的私生女
She was his illegitimate daughter,

756
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,167
但他其实在匈牙利有家室了
but he had a family then in Hungary.

757
00:37:44,234 --> 00:37:45,934
在战争开始之前
It was before the war.

758
00:37:46,001 --> 00:37:48,700
那这为何最后到了钱宁博物馆手里?
How did the painting end up at the Channing?

759
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:51,301
他遗嘱里说把画给我祖母
He willed the painting to my grandmother,

760
00:37:51,368 --> 00:37:54,633
但他死后 博物馆对他的遗嘱视而不见
but when he died, the museum chose to ignore his will.

761
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:57,834
谁会在乎一个著名画家的私生女啊?
Who cares about the illegitimate daughter of a famous artist?

762
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,633
有钱人偷了也不能说偷
It's not theft when rich men do it.

763
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,034
你怎么知道钱宁博物馆的人
How do you know that the Channing

764
00:38:03,101 --> 00:38:04,567
不会再要回去呢?
won't try to take it back again?

765
00:38:04,633 --> 00:38:06,834
要是他们会的话 馆长就要解释
Because if they do, the curator will have to explain

766
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,967
为什么博物馆要违背豪斯腾伯格的遗愿
why the museum went against Haustenberg's wishes,

767
00:38:09,034 --> 00:38:11,834
但... 我觉得他不会这样做
and... I don't think he wants that.

768
00:38:16,834 --> 00:38:19,101
Neal 你到底做什么了?
Neal, what have you done?

769
00:38:20,933 --> 00:38:23,968
我亲爱的Walter 我知道你上次看到了什么 NC

770
00:38:28,633 --> 00:38:30,368
有问题吗?
Problem?

771
00:38:30,434 --> 00:38:31,767
没有没有
No, no.

772
00:38:31,834 --> 00:38:35,867
只是突然觉得...
Just, uh, overcome with the, uh...

773
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:41,800
能看到Haustenberg的原著归其所属
I'm thrilled to have the original Haustenberg

774
00:38:41,867 --> 00:38:43,101
我非常激动
back where it belongs.

775
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,517
偷偷出来幽会
Forbidden romantic meetings

776
00:39:14,584 --> 00:39:16,284
是一件私事 Moz
are kind of a personal thing, Moz.

777
00:39:16,351 --> 00:39:18,184
嗯 说得好像我会让你一个人来一样
Yeah, like I was gonna let you come alone.

778
00:39:18,251 --> 00:39:19,817
万一是戴戒指的人放的纸条呢?
What if the guy with the ring planted that note?

779
00:39:19,884 --> 00:39:21,051
他不会的
He didn't.

780
00:39:21,117 --> 00:39:22,584
当你额头上出现红色光点时
You'll be happy I came

781
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:24,951
你就会高兴多亏我来了
when a red laser dot suddenly appears on your forehead.

782
00:39:25,017 --> 00:39:26,383
别再装英雄了
Enough with the hero talk.

783
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:28,717
- Kate留下了纸条  - 好吧
- Kate left the note.  - Okay.

784
00:39:28,784 --> 00:39:30,784
也许她三天前写的
Maybe she wrote it three days ago

785
00:39:30,851 --> 00:39:32,251
也可能是三个月前写的
or maybe three months ago.

786
00:39:32,318 --> 00:39:33,817
她会来的
She'll be here.

787
00:39:33,884 --> 00:39:36,117
今天是星期五
Well, it is Friday,

788
00:39:36,184 --> 00:39:39,684
已经中午了 那她在哪?
and it was noon, so where is she?

789
00:39:51,284 --> 00:39:52,684
- Kate?  - 喂 Neal?
- Kate?  - Neal?

790
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:55,017
Kate 你在哪?
Kate, where are you?

791
00:39:55,084 --> 00:39:57,117
我没有很多时间
I don't have a lot of time.

792
00:39:58,284 --> 00:39:59,617
你在这
You're here.

793
00:39:59,684 --> 00:40:01,884
Neal 还在听吗?
Neal, are you still there?

794
00:40:01,951 --> 00:40:03,350
听着 Neal
Neal.

795
00:40:03,417 --> 00:40:04,550
嗨
Hi.

796
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:07,884
嗨
Hi.

797
00:40:07,951 --> 00:40:09,218
- 呆着别动 我马上过去...  - 不 Neal
- Stay there. I'm coming...  - No, Neal.

798
00:40:09,284 --> 00:40:10,483
Neal 他就在附近
Neal, he's close.

799
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:12,184
- 戴戒指的男人?  - 对
- The man with the ring?  - Yes.

800
00:40:12,251 --> 00:40:13,717
我不管
I don't care.

801
00:40:13,784 --> 00:40:15,550
听着 我要你告诉我 你把所有东西都藏到哪了
Listen, I need you to tell me where you hid everything.

802
00:40:15,617 --> 00:40:16,951
什么?
What?

803
00:40:17,017 --> 00:40:19,684
钱 债券 艺术品... 所有东西
The money, the bonds, the art...  all of it.

804
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:22,017
怎么了?
Why?

805
00:40:22,084 --> 00:40:23,517
他想样东西...
He wants something...

806
00:40:23,584 --> 00:40:26,084
一样你偷了藏起来的东西
Something you took, something you hid.

807
00:40:26,151 --> 00:40:27,383
我藏了不少东西
I hid a lot of things.

808
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:29,218
那你就全都给他
Well, then, give him everything.

809
00:40:29,284 --> 00:40:31,417
要是他拿到了他想要的 他就会放我回到你身边了
If he gets what he wants, he'll let me come back to you.

810
00:40:31,483 --> 00:40:32,784
他是谁?
Who is he?

811
00:40:32,851 --> 00:40:34,717
我不能告诉你 对你来说太危险了
I can't tell you. It's too dangerous for you.

812
00:40:34,784 --> 00:40:35,951
危险? 怎么这么说?
Dangerous? Why?

813
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:37,318
Kate 告诉我 我能保护你
Kate, just tell me. I can protect you.

814
00:40:37,383 --> 00:40:39,084
你只有这样才能帮我
This is the only way you can help me.

815
00:40:39,151 --> 00:40:41,450
你总是对我说要相信你
You always told me I had to trust you.

816
00:40:41,517 --> 00:40:43,517
现在你要相信我
Well, now you have to trust me.

817
00:40:43,584 --> 00:40:44,884
我想要回家
I want to come home.

818
00:40:46,884 --> 00:40:48,917
拜托你就告诉我你把东西都藏哪了
Please just tell me where you hid everything.

819
00:40:51,251 --> 00:40:52,750

No.

820
00:40:54,584 --> 00:40:55,951
我想要回家
I want to come home.

821
00:40:56,017 --> 00:40:58,051
这是我仅有的赌注了
It's the only leverage I got.

822
00:40:58,117 --> 00:41:00,584
待在那 行吗? 我马上过去 
Just stay there, okay? I'm coming up.

823
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:03,084
Neal! 等等!
Neal! Neal!

824
00:41:06,151 --> 00:41:07,017
Kate吗?
Kate?

825
00:41:09,917 --> 00:41:12,750
Mozzie 跟Neal说我爱他
Mozzie, tell Neal I love him.

826
00:41:12,817 --> 00:41:15,318
告诉他这是唯一的方法
Tell him it's the only way.

827
00:41:21,151 --> 00:41:23,851
嘿 Kate!
Kate!

828
00:41:23,917 --> 00:41:25,084
嘿 Kate!
Kate!
