1
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:05,380
Is everybody okay?!

2
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:06,690
I'm fine.

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:07,750
Thanks for waiting.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:08,620
What was that?

5
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,030
Water heater,gas line
- The training's the same,people.

6
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,460
Just stay low and move out!

7
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:13,960
Honey,luke's gone.

8
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,260
Claire,spontaneous human
combustion is very rare.

9
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:18,330
I don't think he exploded,phil.

10
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:19,970
The rope ladder works.

11
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:21,980
At least someone followed protocol.

12
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:23,160
Oh!Oh,it's there!

13
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,360
Smoke is coming out of
luke's stupid suitcase.

14
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,520
Like his old man,luke is a magician.

15
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,280
I'm taking lessons from
some guy my dad found online.

16
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:34,130
He came personally
recommended from the guy

17
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,490
who runs the warlock
conference up in modesto.

18
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,010
Ocupado,big guy.

19
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,560
Find another foxhole.

20
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:22,460
this is how we learn to sing

21
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:26,470
who can go up here with me

22
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:30,050
cam took a job teaching music
at the local middle school.

23
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,760
Yeah,his first day is tomorrow.

24
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:35,430
I'm excited for me,but I'm probably
more excited for the students

25
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,680
because a great teacher is a gift.

26
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:38,650
Hasn't started yet.

27
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,110
I have to tip my hat to my
high school music teacher...

28
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,350
A real force of nature who was also the
defensive coordinator for the football team

29
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,770
and supervised calf birthing
for the animal husbandry club.

30
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,850
Doris olson.

31
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,820
Great lady.

32
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,010
Lady.

33
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:58,360
this is how we learn to sing

37
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,950
Ay,jay,i'm going to miss you.

38
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:19,730
It's one night.

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,220
No,I don't want to be without you,not
even one night in my whole life.

40
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,080
What can I make you?

41
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,180
How about a little room
on my side of the bed?

42
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,220
I mean,I shouldn't complain.My
wife's a knockout.But...

43
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,300
She's at that place in her
pregnancy where,she's,you know...

44
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:35,920
Ample.

45
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:36,920
And the snoring.

46
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:40,200
I swear in the last ultrasound,the
baby was like this...

47
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,770
So I should be home about noon tomorrow.

48
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,130
Who drank all the coffee?

49
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,200
Oh,i,uh,I had quite a bit of that.

50
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,800
You know,I haven't,um,been
sleeping too well.

51
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,830
There's actually a funny story
about what's causing that.

52
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,360
Mom,I'm fully aware of the
changes your body is going through,

53
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,120
and that nasal stuffiness is
very common during pregnancy,

54
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,000
but we got a crisis in this house.

55
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,180
You've been snoring.

56
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,530
But I got you these nasal strips.

57
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:06,830
In the commercial,the old man's angry
red sound waves turn a gentle blue.

58
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,880
So I'm like an old man?

59
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:09,670
no!

60
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,860
Like a dog then?

61
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:11,750
A pig?

62
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,240
What is it,manny?I'm an
old man,a dog,or a pig?

63
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,510
Jay,help me out here.

64
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,290
You've heard it.

65
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,530
I don't know what the
boy's talking about.

66
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,240
If this is a glimpse of
teenage manny,I don't love it.

67
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,330
Have a little respect
for your beautiful mother.

68
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,450
Thank you,jay.

69
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,410
You're right.

70
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,610
Sorry,mom.

71
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,720
And,jay,have a great
trip to san francisco.

72
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,290
Okay,lily's drop-off time
is between 8:45 and 8:50,

73
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:40,590
so you should be fine
to get to work by 9:00.

74
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,200
Here is her checklist for her backpack.

75
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,010
Oh,I have this whole thing planned.

76
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,380
Okay,I'm gonna walk in,take off my
jacket,and say,"here comes treble.

77
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,130
" Big swing on the first day.

78
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,890
Please don't tamp down my enthusiasm.

79
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:52,500
Okay,what else?

80
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:56,300
The dimmer came in for the switch,so I want
you to call the electrician,but not brad.

81
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,250
Remember?We had a problem with
him last time about the billing.

82
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,740
He wanted his name above the title?

83
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,870
Yes,you've done that joke before.

84
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,210
So cute.So funny.What else?

85
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,010
Lily needs to get a present
for gio's birthday party.

86
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:06,120
And don't be thrown by the invitation.

87
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:08,000
It is a pirates
party,not a pilates party.

88
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,440
Now sit.I wanna talk juice boxes.

89
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,270
Cam.Cam,I know what's happening here.

90
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,600
You're feeling very anxious
about your first day at work,

91
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,680
and you're focusing that
anxiety on my day with lily.

92
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,020
Really?

93
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,980
Are you sure I'm not completely confident about
my first day because it's gonna be a home run,

94
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,740
and I am worried about you because you're
taking on a little bit more of the lily load?

95
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,480
Don't be scared,sweetie.

96
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,140
She's not scared!

97
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,350
Wh-wh-what
are you doing?

98
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,480
Just call me if you need me.

99
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,720
- I won't!
- And thank you for managing my expectations today.

100
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,830
Not necessary.

101
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,320
I saw you practicing a bow last night.

102
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,390
That was just in fun.

103
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:39,030
You know,I highly doubt some teenagers
are gonna throw rose petals at my feet.

104
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:44,060
But I wouldn't be surprised if I got
slow-clapped out of my first class.

105
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,380
Wrong.

106
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,860
I am thinking.

107
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:51,380
If you were thinking,you wouldn't have
seattle as the capital of washington.

108
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,370
Yeah.It's spokane.

109
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,100
Sure,which makes the 11th president
of the united states "james k.Pslk.

110
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,900
" Okay,alex,stop.

111
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,340
I'm trying to figure this out.

112
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,640
Buzz.Time's up,dummy.It's olympia.

113
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,170
Make sure you sound
out the big scary words.

114
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,760
Mom,something's on my mind,and
it's really bothering me.

115
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,960
Yeah,it's really bothering
me,too,but I think it's gonna be rich,

116
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,260
so we better be nice to it.

117
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,520
I wanna quit magic.

118
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:19,640
What?

119
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,350
I'm not really interested anymore,but
I don't think dad's gonna be happy.

120
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,280
Oh,sweetheart.Don't worry
about disappointing your father.

121
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,500
He only wants you to do
it if you wanna do it.

122
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:28,820
Tell you what.

123
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,950
I will talk to dad

124
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,550
Talk to dad?That sounds serious.

125
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:37,330
Don't do drugs.Stay in school.

126
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,620
Luke wants to quit magic.

127
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,230
That's not happening.

128
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,340
Well,see you guys at dinner.

129
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,440
Sweetheart,don't you even
want to talk about this?

130
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,090
What's to talk about?The
kid's a natural.

131
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:47,560
He has everything-the
hands,the patter,the outfits.

132
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,930
Okay,let's play this out.

133
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:52,520
Even if he is one in a million,what's
our best case scenario here?

134
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,660
He becomes,what...

135
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,850
- A professional magician!
- A professional magician?

136
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,990
Honey,the boy has a gift.

137
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,320
You wanna just throw that away?

138
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,920
I don't think it's
about throwing it away.

139
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,260
- I think it's about you pushing him
- don't I get a say in any of this?

140
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,690
I'm sorry I don't like magic
as much as you,but I don't.

141
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,810
This isn't about magic.

142
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,170
No,it's about my life
and you controlling it.

143
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,230
Look,you made a commitment.

144
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:11,520
You will honor that commitment.

145
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,110
I hate it here!

146
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:16,460
Luke!

147
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,960
All right,young ladies and gentlemen,if
I can have your attention,please.

148
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:30,750
Let's settle down

149
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,320
and let's say a temporary good-bye to
your neighbor and to life as you know it,

150
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,810
because here comes treble.

151
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:40,310
That's right,my friends,we got
treble,right here at franklin middle.

152
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,730
I'm cameron t.,and that rhymes with
"g," and that stands for "good morning"!

153
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,960
Yes!Love the enthusiasm.Go
ahead.First question.

154
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,120
When's Mr.Namagachi coming back?

155
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:55,200
Okay,Mr.Namagachi isn't coming back,but there
is somebody that i'd like to introduce you to.

156
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,780
Don't know that you properly met.

157
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:02,290
She's a good friend of mine,and
she goes by the name of "music.

158
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:08,400
" And sometimes my
friend music can be shy.

159
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,250
Sometimes she can be angry!

160
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,920
Sometimes she can be playful.

161
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:24,170
And sometimes she can
be downright a-funky!

162
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,720
Train wreck.

163
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,690
There's no way he ran
this past mitchell.

164
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:33,110
Daddy always parks in
the back of the school.

165
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:36,860
I know,sweetie,but,uh,those
spots were all taken.

166
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,840
Because we're late?

167
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,840
No,we're,like,a minute late,and
that's 'cause of traffic.

168
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:44,270
And because I tipped over.You
didn't snap my car seat right.

169
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:46,040
Okay,well,it certainly
didn't hurt your memory any.

170
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,310
All right,here's your lunch.

171
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,190
You spilled it!

172
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:51,860
Why is the top open?

173
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,230
Daddy always zips it for me.

174
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,770
Maybe you should zip it.

175
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,150
I heard that.

176
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:00,500
- So with just a few more minutes left
- Mr.Namagachi...

177
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,330
Used to work here,but he got fired,okay?

178
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:07,870
So now let's form an orchestra made up of my
favorite instruments Your beautiful bodies.

179
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,880
Gettin' creepy.

180
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:11,670
Okay,so you guys are gonna
be my,uh,table slappers.

181
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,730
You're my bass line.

182
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,950
Okay,and you're gonna be mouth
trumpeters in the back with the melody.

183
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,980
Okay,now let's bring it all together.

184
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:20,910
One,two,three.

185
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:25,330
The bass line is a
little A little softer.

186
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,690
Okay,louder with the mouth trumpets.

187
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,020
Okay.Great.Well,thank you so much.

188
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,830
And,um,I thought it
was a great first day.

189
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,020
And I love the
give-and-take,everyone.

190
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,300
And,um...

191
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,730
Hey,dad.

192
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,400
How's frisco?

193
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,810
My meetings ended early.

194
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,240
I didn't even have to spend the night.

195
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:48,530
And don't say "frisco.

196
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,440
" They hate it when you call it "frisco.

197
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,250
" How do you know what they hate?

198
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,490
You've been there two
times in your life.

199
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,260
Anyway,I haven't slept in a week.

200
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,990
Gloria's snoring like a water buffalo.

201
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:00,330
Well,she's pregnant.It's uncomfortable.

202
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:03,620
What,she put on 15?20?25?30?

203
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,680
We're not doing this again.

204
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,640
How do I bring it up?

205
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,890
Well,for starters,you don't.

206
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:10,330
You suck it up.

207
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:14,480
Dad,your hot wife who was learning
to walk when you were 30 years old,

208
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:19,210
is pregnant with a baby you conceived
doing something most men would kill to do.

209
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,800
I'm just so tired.

210
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:24,090
It's a small sacrifice compared
to what she's going through.

211
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:28,620
- Poor thing,what with the extra...30?35?40?45?
- We're done.

212
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,410
All right,here we go.How's this?

213
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:31,900
That's not the kind we get.

214
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,500
Okay.

215
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:38,160
Hello?Hey,cam.Just
checking in on me again?

216
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,140
Yeah.Just wanted to see if you got lily.

217
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,760
Yeah,we're-we're just- We're at the
grocery store,having a great time.

218
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:47,020
Yeah.Any questions about the...

219
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,760
About the grocery list?

220
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,330
No,we're just picking up the granola.

221
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,420
So how was it?How was the big debut?

222
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,830
Was it a comfortable ride around the
schoolyard on the shoulders of the children?

223
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:57,870
Well,I stood and delivered.

224
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,600
Thank you for sarcastically asking.

225
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,850
Okay,did you call the
electrician about the dimmer?

226
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,570
Yes.Yeah.Yeah,I'm on the
other line with him right now.

227
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:08,130
Oh,well,I should probably let you go.

228
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:08,940
Keep your eye on lily.

229
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:10,250
She has a tendency to wander off.

230
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:13,790
Cam...Uh,wh-wh-i'm- I'm
totally capable of...

231
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,830
You lost her,didn't you?

232
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,610
No.No,no,no,no.No,she
is right next to me.

233
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,350
Hi,honey.

234
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,400
I can hear it in your voice.

235
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,420
Look in the dairy case.

236
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:23,230
Cam,do you honestly
think that I would lose...

237
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,740
The doors don't pull.They slide.

238
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,060
You never saw me.

239
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,640
Thank you very much.

240
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:57,250
hey.

241
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:02,610
Look,um,I thought about it,and if
you really want to,you can quit magic.

242
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:08,960
You just have to do one thing
first Execute the butler's escape.

243
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:12,570
It goes without saying that the butler's
escape is one of the most challenging feats

244
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,880
of escapology an
illusionist can perform.

245
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:19,140
It's-it's based,of course,on the well-known
story of the earl of flanning's manservant percy,

246
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,470
who was imprisoned in the tower
of london,and as we all know,

247
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,480
refused to take off his
uniform when he was shackled.

248
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:28,330
Famously,as the,uh,tower
guard gert slept,

249
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:33,600
percy freed himself and leapt over the sleeping
guard,giving rise to the popular expression...

250
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:37,660
"percy jumped the gert.

251
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,150
" Why are you making
me do this stupid trick?

252
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:41,990
I think you're quitting...

253
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,380
Because magic's getting hard,and that's
not a good reason for quitting anything.

254
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,010
But...

255
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:50,640
If you can do this,then I'll know
that you genuinely don't like it,

256
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,130
and you'll have my blessing
to pursue other interests.

257
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,780
No strings attached.

258
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:56,430
Sorry,buddy.

259
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:57,420
I'm so sorry.

260
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,170
You're kidding,right?

261
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:02,450
You cannot really be
enjoying that stupid show.

262
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,720
I was changing channels.

263
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:05,870
God.Why are you so mean lately?

264
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,130
Is something wrong with you?

265
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,330
Is it that obvious?

266
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,260
Oh,my gosh.Come on.You can talk to me.

267
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:13,350
Well...

268
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,310
There's this girl at school,and...

269
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,010
She got pregnant.

270
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:19,640
no.

271
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:19,900
I know.

272
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,960
I've been trying to help her,but with all
the pills she's taking,she kinda lashes out.

273
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:25,430
Oh,honey,this is too much
for you to take on alone.

274
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,630
Where are the parents?

275
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:27,330
They're no help.

276
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,420
Dad's all consumed with his
plastic surgery business,

277
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,760
and her mom's an ex-model who's
trying to launch a music career.

278
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:34,390
You're describing the show
I was just watching,right?

279
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,090
I'm just saying,mix in a
book every now and then.

280
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,540
Mean!Mean!

281
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,420
Try to see this from my perspective.

282
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:41,250
I can't.

283
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:43,160
I'm not raising a quitter.

284
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,770
Trust me.I know what's best for you.

285
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:46,970
And watch your time.

286
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:50,450
In the stage version,the rope's on fire,and
you're suspended over a bed of nails.

287
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,110
I hate this!

288
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,380
Why are you making me do this?

289
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,710
Use that anger,lukini.

290
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:57,680
Let it be the key that
opens the vault of fear...

291
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:04,040
That holds the chalice of hope
that contains the elixir of success.

292
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,890
In a few short minutes...

293
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,770
Son of alkazeel!You've done it!

294
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,740
I quit.

295
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,160
So how was your first day?

296
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,020
Tell me everything.

297
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,470
Well,you know,it was a lovefest.

298
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,740
And the kids
- They were,you know,and...

299
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,150
Is that a roast?

300
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,200
W
- yes.Yes.

301
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,010
But I'm surprised you
could smell it over the ...

302
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:34,840
no dairy yellow pepper
bisque with cheesy croutons.

303
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,500
- You had time to do a roast and soup.
- Hi,daddy!

304
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,010
Hi,angel!

305
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:40,840
How are you?Did you miss daddy?

306
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:43,470
Bathed and braided.

307
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:45,950
Yeah.Let me just put you in
a more flattering light here.

308
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,310
The dimmer.

309
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,570
Who'd you call?

310
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,540
I called myself 'cause I did it.

311
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,540
Yeah,I had time after picking
up gio's present,so,uh...

312
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,890
Go show daddy what it is.

313
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:56,900
- Okay.
- Yeah.

314
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,110
It sounds like you had a
pretty successful day yourself.

315
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:02,100
Well,it's just a matter
of being organized.

316
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:03,360
But who am I telling,huh?

317
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,080
You do this sort of stuff every day.

318
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,270
Oh,blow on that.

319
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,720
So tell me more about the kids.

320
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,000
Well,it was as I predicted,you know.

321
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,370
They just needed somebody to come in
there and bring music back to life.

322
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,040
And,you know,that person was...

323
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:17,960
That person was...

324
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,300
It's not me!

325
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:21,120
What's happening?

326
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,660
It was a disaster,mitchell.

327
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,190
They hated me!

328
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,740
Not just the kids,the teachers.

329
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,080
They wouldn't sit with me
at lunch.I had to sit alone.

330
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,030
Oh,honey.

331
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,640
And my sweater-the shop
teacher spilled juice on it.

332
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,910
He said it was an accident,but
it wasn't an accident.

333
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:34,950
It's okay.

334
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,030
It's not okay!

335
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,630
I failed miserably.

336
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,030
And look at you.You did
everything so perfectly.

337
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,530
Well,yes.

338
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,300
And-and-and
no.Look,look,I...

339
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:46,930
I gotta tell ya.

340
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,460
I've just been watching how you've done
things all these years,and I just perfected it.

341
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,410
- Oh,please,mitchell!
- Claire...

342
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,660
Cam,he was every bit
the failure you were.

343
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,020
He was late picking up lily.

344
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:58,720
She was in with the custodians.

345
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:02,060
The only thing he had less to do
with than dinner was the dimmer.

346
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:05,240
And her hair was in braids
because there was gum in it.

347
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:05,920
And...

348
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:07,430
Why are we hugging?

349
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:11,680
Because I know if he called you for help and
heard as many insults as I know he had to hear,

350
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,140
then he had a worse day than me.

351
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,960
Oh,she was horrible,cam.

352
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:16,790
You know what?It's gonna get better.

353
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:19,150
No,I know.We just need some time
to settle into these new roles.

354
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,810
You were right to lower my expectations.

355
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,470
I just wish I had lowered mine.

356
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,780
This gonna work its way around
to a "thank you," ladies?

357
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:37,620
Hey,honey.

358
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,680
Surprise!I'm in san francisco!

359
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,310
What?

360
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:45,020
I dropped manny at a friend's and,I know it's
crazy,but I hopped on a plane and I'm here!

361
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,240
I'm driving to the hotel.

362
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:47,520
That is so great.

363
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,740
The thing is,honey,i'm
not here right now.

364
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,960
See,I'm,uh,i'm out at dinner.

365
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,460
Probably won't be back for,um...

366
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:57,680
Oh,I don't know.A couple of hours.

367
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,300
It's okay.I'll wait for you there.

368
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:00,690
Don't be silly.

369
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,610
How often do you get to san francisco?

370
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:04,120
There's so much to see there.

371
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:05,620
I mean,here.

372
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,580
Ghirardelli square?Fisherman's
wharf?Alcatraz?

373
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:11,370
Hey,take that segway tour.

374
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:12,730
That's a great way to see the city.

375
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,820
And when you get the chowder,make
sure it's in one of those bread bowls.

376
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:16,950
You can eat the bowl.

377
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:19,570
Yeah,it's a story you'll
tell for a lifetime.

378
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,760
You know what?Later on...

379
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:29,330
Maybe we can watch some
of your lance burton dvds.

380
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,470
Thanks.I think I just
wanna try this escape.

381
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,860
Would you mind tightening my arms?

382
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:34,930
Oh.Sure.

383
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,200
It's just hard,you know?

384
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,400
It's the first time he hasn't
shared one of my interests.

385
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,170
It's scary to think that this
is the start of us growing apart.

386
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:45,370
Oh,honey,it's probably just a phase.

387
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:46,970
Alex is going through
something right now.

388
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,420
I wish I could figure that out.

389
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,540
I can't breathe.

390
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,400
Anxiety.

391
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,220
No,no,I'm-i'm fighting the jacket.

392
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,610
The key to this escape is balance.

393
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:58,500
The whole thing is based on the idea of
opposing forces holding each other in check.

394
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,470
That actually makes some sense.

395
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,490
Some sense?

396
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,410
there are two things I
know with dead certainty

397
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:10,990
How to shoulder roll out of a human pyramid,and
the black arts of the butler's escape.

398
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,480
No,honey,our house is out of balance
because alex is missing her opposing force.

399
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,240
Y-you're missing out.

400
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:22,420
Some people describe this
escape as visual poetry.

401
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:26,520
Honey?

402
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,680
Oh,no.

403
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:36,810
Gloria.

404
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,540
You told me that you were in
frisco,and you were here in a hotel?

405
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:42,930
Let me just say one thing.

406
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,600
Don't say "frisco." They hate that.

407
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:46,350
And how the hell did you find me?

408
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:50,260
The house has been a little noisy lately,and
the school library is a pickup scene.

409
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,350
So where does a kid go
for some peace and quiet?

410
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,140
Tell me right now if
you're having an affair,

411
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:07,610
and we will find some time
later for me to kill you.

412
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:11,070
No.I'm just trying to have one
night away from your snoring.

413
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:14,190
- You came to a hotel to sleep?
- I'm exhausted,

414
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,830
and I didn't want to hurt your
feelings,but you're huge and you're loud.

415
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,690
It's like sleeping with rush limbaugh.

416
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:20,750
And I didn't want to bring it up

417
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,250
because I figured you'd get mad
at me the way you got mad at manny.

418
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:26,320
I am not mad at you because
you told me that I snore.

419
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,760
I am mad at you because
you didn't say anything.

420
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,230
'cause I didn't want to get yelled at.

421
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,530
Well,too bad.

422
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:35,290
When you're married to me,you're
going to get yelled at many times.

423
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,630
And you're tough enough to take it.

424
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,060
That's what I love about our marriage.

425
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:43,590
We can say whatever we want,but
the next day,we're still there.

426
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,310
That's what I like about it,too.

427
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,330
What am I gonna say
you couldn't forgive me?

428
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:49,770
There are things,jay.

429
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:50,880
You ready to go?

430
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:56,430
I was thinking,it's such a shame that
this hotel room is going to go to waste.

431
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,030
I like where this is headed.

432
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:00,180
Make manny some pasta.

433
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,980
I'll see you tomorrow morning,okay?

434
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,170
- Hey,dad.
- Hey,buddy.

435
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,970
- Look,I...I'm sorry if I...
- No,no,no.

436
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,480
No,don't apologize.

437
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,950
There's still plenty of
stuff we can do together.

438
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:20,580
So if you want out,you are...Out!

439
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,390
Uh,I know we bought
a lot of magic stuff,

440
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:30,920
but we can return some of it
- Merlin's hat,the gloves,most of the capes.

441
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,440
What about houdini's wands?

442
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,190
They kinda got broken.

443
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,770
All three?What happened?I
got you carbon fiber.

444
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,890
Some kids were messing
around with them at school.

445
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:40,700
What do you mean?

446
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,830
What-what were they doing?

447
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:44,950
I don't really want to talk about it.

448
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:52,190
You know,I went through
that,kids-kids messing with my stuff.

449
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:52,860
Really?

450
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:56,050
Oh,yeah.In high school,when I first got
nominated for junior tumbling congress,

451
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,730
my parents had to sign a...Release!

452
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:08,790
Anyway,my buddy dizzy brindizzi saw
it,grabbed it,and made a lot of fun of me.

453
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,900
I thought about not going.

454
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,050
But you did.

455
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:12,730
Oh,yeah.

456
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:14,360
Had a blast.

457
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:19,170
Made a lot of friends,shared milkshakes
with more than one female tumbler.

458
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,710
The minute I stopped caring what other people
thought and started doing what I wanted to do,

459
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:26,590
is the minute I finally felt...Free!

460
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,340
Buddy...

461
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:39,500
You're gonna make your own choices,and
whatever you decide,i'll always support you.

462
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,970
You're not just saying all
this 'cause you're stuck,right?

463
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:45,090
Nothing you decide
will ever disappoint me.

464
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,150
Thanks,dad.

465
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:54,320
Relax your arms,roll your shoulders
forward,bend down your head,exhale...

466
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:55,290
And then arch.

467
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,150
It sorta worked.

00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,320
Well,honey,I just wanted
to check in and say hi.
