"生活大爆炸" 前情提要...
Previously on The Big Bang Theory...

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,100
Sheldon 你是找出了
Sheldon, did you just figure out

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,400
人工合成新的稳定超重元素的方法了吗?
a method for synthesizing a new stable super-heavy element?

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,060
是吗?
Did I?!

5
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,330
这不对劲
Well, that can't be right.

6
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:13,030
以前都没人做到的
No one's ever done that before.

7
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:14,560
除了我 因为我算出来了!
Except me because I just did it!

8
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,760
# Sheldon的脑子最管用 耶 #
# Sheldon and his brain, yeah #

9
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,730
# Sheldon的脑子最管用 耶! #
# Sheldon and his brain, yeah! #

10
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:21,100
我犯了一个天大的错误
I've made a horrible mistake.

11
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,230
你在说什么呢?
What are you talking about?

12
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,930
这个周期表... 它的单位是平方厘米
This table, it's in square centimeters

13
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,000
但是我当成平方米了
I read it as square meters.

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,500
你知道这意味着什么吗?
You know what that means?

15
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,900
美国人不擅长公制?
That Americans can't handle the metric system?

16
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:36,500
Amy 我相差了整整一万倍
Amy, I was off by a factor of 10,000.

17
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,830
可是中国研究队发现了这个元素啊
But the Chinese team found the element.

18
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:39,830
没错 但他们不该发现的
Yeah, well, they shouldn't have.

19
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,830
我的计算是错的
My calculations were wrong.

20
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,730
这个我生命中伟大的科学成就
The greatest scientific achievement of my life

21
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:45,460
是基于一个错误
is based on a blunder.

22
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:46,730
我不是天才
I'm not a genius.

23
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,130
而是个骗子
I'm a fraud.

24
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:50,260
Sheldon 在神经学里
You know, Sheldon, in neuroscience,

25
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:53,000
我们总是在意想之外的地方
we're forever finding something in one part of the brain

26
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,500
发现我们要找的东西
that we thought was someplace else.

27
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,100
这下好了 我连骗子都不如
Oh, great, now I'm worse than a fraud.

28
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,200
简直是生物学家了
I'm practically a biologist.

29
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:02,000
现在...

30
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,530
这里是"科学星期五"节目 我是Ira Flatow
This is Science Friday. I'm Ira Flatow.

31
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,860
今天的嘉宾发现了第一个
My guest today is responsible for the discovery of the first

32
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,400
稳定超重元素
stable super-heavy element.

33
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,960
欢迎做客节目 Sheldon Cooper博士
Welcome, Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

34
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,760
谢谢
Thank you.

35
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,300
是大学让我来的
Uh, the university made me come here.

36
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,630
我可不情愿
I didn't want to.

37
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,660
我很喜欢这档节目
Uh, big fan of the show.

38
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,560
我获悉 你是由一个意外
So, I understand that you actually discovered

39
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,760
才发现了这个元素
this element by mistake.

40
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,600
没错
Yes.

41
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,730
有些科学界的人称之为
And some people in the science community are calling it

42
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,630
"奇妙的错误"
"The Wonder Blunder."

43
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,300
是谁? 告诉我名字
Who? Give me their names.

44
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,260
我猜一定是Wolowitz
I bet it's Wolowitz.

45
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,560
这整件事情太神奇了
It's just such a fascinating story.

46
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,100
你的计算彻底错了
Your calculations are way off,

47
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,530
但他们却找到了元素
but they find the element anyway.

48
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,700
就像是看错了寻宝图
It's like misreading a treasure map

49
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,230
却还是找到了宝藏
and still finding the treasure.

50
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,160
我们能聊聊其它话题吗?
Can we talk about something else?

51
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,600
你知道我会唱约德尔腔吗?
Do you know that I yodel?

52
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,600
{\an8}(一种乡村唱法)

53
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,530
很有趣 但这件事可能会让你
That's interesting, but this could be taking you

54
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,160
获得诺贝尔奖
down the path toward a Nobel Prize.

55
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,560
不过是化学方面的
And in Chemistry, no less.

56
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,730
难道不是很不寻常吗?
And wouldn't that be unusual?

57
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,580
因为你是个物理学家
Because you're a physicist.

58
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,460
没错 那我就会是一个拿了化学诺贝尔奖的物理学家
Yes, yes, I'd be a physicist with a Nobel in Chemistry.

59
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,460
大家都会嘲笑马戏团的小丑
Everyone laugh at the circus freak.

60
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:14,430
要知道 我不用坐在这儿被你羞辱的 Flatow
You know, I don't need to sit here and take this, Flatow.

61
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,760
就因为有你这样的混混
It is because of bullies like you,

62
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,500
现在越来越多的美国人
every day more and more Americans

63
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,800
才会放弃广播 转看电视的
are making the switch to television.

Seibert校长 我不知道你干嘛要大吼大叫
President Seibert, I don't know why you're yelling.

75
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,060
是你让我去接受电台访谈的
You're the one who made me go on the radio.

76
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,860
我本来以为是专业的科学采访
I was expecting a professional science interview,

77
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,560
不是这种攻击人为乐的无脑节目
not an attack by some morning zoo shock jock.

78
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,130
如果学校这么需要钱的话
Well, if the university needs money so badly,

79
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,730
你不如搞个脏话罐
perhaps you should start a swear jar.

80
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:13,060
哇哦! 这句就得罚一美元
Whoa! That one's worth a dollar.

81
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,930
我知道你不喜欢做采访
I know you don't like it,

82
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,260
但每次你接受采访
but every time you do an interview,

83
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,200
学校曝光率就高一点
it raises the profile of the university.

84
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,860
筹款就多一些
That translates to funding.

85
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,000
但我不是被耍的猴啊
Yeah, well, I'm not just

86
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,730
为赚硬币而跳舞
some trained monkey dancing for coins.

87
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:26,830
你当然不是
Of course you're not.

88
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,730
人们至少喜欢猴子
People love trained monkeys.

89
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,130
你怎么能不开心呢?
How can you not be happy?

90
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,860
你又高 又瘦 又有名
You're tall, thin and famous.

91
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,860
天啊 我嫉妒Sheldon
Oh, my God, I'm jealous of Sheldon.

92
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:39,830
反正像这样的事情还得再继续
Look, you're gonna be doing this stuff for a while.

93
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:42,260
你不如找到一种方式来适应它
You're just gonna have to find a way to get used to it.

94
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,160
但你们都不知道那是什么滋味
But none of you know what this is like.

95
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,300
因为一件你后悔的事而被祝贺
Being celebrated for something you wish you never did.

96
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,360
嗯... 看来你没跟我一起过狂欢节
Mmm... you clearly haven't been with me at Mardi Gras.

97
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,130
想不想停下游戏 帮我收拾?
Want to pause the video game and help me clean up?

98
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,300
我在收拾呢
I am cleaning up.

99
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,560
看看小丑把哥谭市祸害成什么样了
Look at the mess the Joker made of Gotham City.

100
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,730
拜托 要来住的是你朋友
Come on, it's your friend who's coming to stay here.

101
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,130
Raj是在印度长大的
Raj grew up in India.

102
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,330
他见过更脏的地方 相信我
Trust me, he's seen worse.

103
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,260
Howie啊
Howie.

104
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,500
我保证
I promise I'll help out

105
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,500
这周我都会帮忙的
the rest of the week.

106
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,700
这周?
The rest of the week?

107
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,430
你说他只住一两晚
You said it was just gonna be a night or two.

108
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,500
是 但如果我跟你说一周
Yeah, but if I told you a week,

109
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,500
你会答应吗?
would you have said yes?

110
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,260
- 不会!  - 对啊 我别无选择嘛
- No!  - Then you left me no choice.

111
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,930
我喜欢Raj 但作为客人 他要住的也太久了
I love Raj, but that's a long time for a house guest.

112
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,600
但他们在补他的房子呢
I know, but they're tenting his building.

113
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,860
他找不到可以带狗入住的旅馆
He can't find a hotel he likes that allows dogs.

114
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,460
他要带Cinnamon来?
He's bringing Cinnamon?

115
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,460
住一周!
For a whole week!

116
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,360
有些人的胆子可真是不小啊
The nerve of some people.

117
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,800
驶来的是耻辱号
Here comes the Embarrassment Express.

118
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,430
将停靠在卑鄙骗子村...
With stops at Fraudville...

119
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,900
大错特错镇...
WonderBlunderberg...

120
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,900
和堪萨斯市
and Kansas City.

121
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,160
因为那是交通枢纽
Because it's a hub.

122
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,200
Sheldon 我能进来吗?
Sheldon, can I come in?

123
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,800
- 你有饼干吗?  - 没有
- Do you have cookies?  - No.

124
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,600
好 我也不配吃饼干 进来吧
Good. I don't deserve cookies. Come in.

125
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:00,000
Wil你...?
Wil...?

126
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,930
嘿 Sheldon
Hey, Sheldon.

127
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:01,860
好久不见啊
It's been a while.

128
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,400
你怎么来了?
Why are you here?

129
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,460
Amy说你最近不太开心
Amy said you were having a rough time,

130
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,960
所以我想我们可以聊聊
and I thought maybe we could talk.

131
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,830
可以吗?
Is that okay?

132
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,460
当然
Certainly.

133
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,530
尽管...
Although...

134
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,060
有三个人在我的房间里
right now, I'm having a rough time

135
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,800
所以现在我不太开心
because there's three people in my room,

136
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,600
我感觉有点像在迪斯科舞厅里
and it's starting to feel like a discotheque.

137
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:19,430
Sheldon 你说你不希望因为自己后悔的事
Sheldon, you said you were unhappy getting attention

138
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,760
而得到关注
for something you wished you never did.

139
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,530
是 我有点理解那种感觉
Yeah, I know a little something about that.

140
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,630
胡说 Wil
Oh, nonsense, Wil.

141
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:29,200
你没完没了的发推特也没那么讨厌
Your endless tweets are not that bad.

142
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,530
我知道我们为什么这么久没见了
I remember why it's been a while.

143
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:34,100
Sheldon 其实我想说的是
Sheldon, I was actually talking

144
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,760
我小时候 演星际迷航的时候
about when I was a kid on Star Trek.

145
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,230
你演的是Wesley Crusher
How could you not like getting attention

146
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,700
怎么会不喜欢被关注呢?
for playing Wesley Crusher?

147
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,830
你演的太棒了
You were wonderful.

148
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,560
一个过目不忘而且无所不知的天才男孩
A know-it-all boy genius with an eidetic memory.

149
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,260
谁看了都会觉得你把他们自己给演出来了
Who couldn't relate to that?

150
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,130
呃 并不是所有人都这么想
Well, not everybody felt that way.

151
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,830
很多人讨厌我的角色
A lot of people really hated the character,

152
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:54,060
有些人连带着也讨厌起我来
and some of them hated me because of it.

153
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,030
我参加采访的时候
I would do interviews,

154
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,730
人们对我的态度很不好
and people would be mean to me.

155
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:59,060
我就是这么被欺负的
That just happened to me.

156
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,800
下一次你想不出推特发什么好的时候
Next time you're stuck for a tweet,

157
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,100
就说Ira Flatow是个混蛋
feel free to say what a jerk Ira Flatow is.

158
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,130
Sheldon 重点是Wil学会了怎么接受
Sheldon, the point is Wil learned to embrace

159
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:10,400
他那段不愉快的生活 然后继续向更大更高的目标努力
that part of his life and moved on to bigger and better things.

160
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,900
是啊 我现在是作家了
Yeah, I'm an author now,

161
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,530
我给公众演讲
I do public speaking,

162
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:15,600
而且我自己还制作了有关棋牌游戏的网络剧
and I have my own Web series about board games.

163
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,000
呃...
Uh...

164
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,830
我们现在是给Sheldon鼓劲 所以...
We're trying to cheer him up, so...

165
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,860
我的意思是曾经有一段时间
I'm just saying that there was a time

166
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,330
我认为我爬不出Wesley Crusher的阴影了
when I thought I would never get out of Wesley Crusher's shadow.

167
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,700
但是现在我明白
But now,

168
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,160
那段经历只是我精彩生活的一小部分
it's just one small part of a pretty great life,

169
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,260
而且我很高兴我拥有了那样一段经历
and it's a part that I'm happy is there.

170
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,560
我明白你的意思
I do see what you're saying.

171
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,060
对我很有帮助
That helps.

172
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,200
那就好
Good.

173
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,400
你们俩愿意留下来
Would you two like to stay

174
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,530
跟我一起玩火车吗?
and play trains with me?

175
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:42,530
- 没问题  - 好的
- Sure.  - Okay.

176
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:43,630
噢 太好了!
Oh, great!

177
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:46,900
现在...
Now...

178
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,000
我来控制火车
I work the controls.

179
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,130
我来说"各位请上车"
I say "All aboard."

180
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:52,060
你们安静地坐在那看着就好
You sit quietly and watch.

181
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,060
我能给火车鸣笛吗?
Can I blow the whistle?

182
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,460
那你还是走吧
You should probably go.

183
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,330
你要在我的沙发上刷牙?
You're gonna brush your teeth on my couch?

184
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:10,400
不是啊 我要给Cinnamon刷牙
No, I'm gonna brush Cinnamon's teeth.

185
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,500
干嘛给狗刷牙啊?
Why bother?

186
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,660
她每天花一半的时间
She spends half the time

187
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,030
在舔屁股
licking her butt.

188
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,600
那另一半时间都在舔我的脸啊
And the other half licking my face.

189
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,500
所以我才要给她刷牙
That's why I'm brushing her teeth.

190
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,460
嗨 不好意思我回来晚了
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm so late.

191
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,430
你们已经吃过晚饭了吗?
Did you already have dinner?

192
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,060
没呢 我们在等你回来
No, we were waiting for you.

193
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,400
哦 真体贴
Aw, that's so sweet.

194
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,430
那是 你晚饭打算做什么?
Yeah. So what do you feel like making?

195
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,330
Howard怎么说话的 小可怜
Howard, the poor thing

196
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:32,330
刚刚才下班回家
just got home from work.

197
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,500
让我给你倒一杯酒吧
Let me get you a glass of wine.

198
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,130
我来做饭
I'll cook dinner.

199
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:38,030
- 噢 Raj 那怎么行 你是我们的客人啊  - 不要客气了
- Oh, Raj, you're our guest.  - Don't be silly.

200
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:40,030
坐下来 看样子你忙了一整天
Sit. You look like you've had a long day.

201
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:42,860
才不是呢 她每天都是这副样子
No, she always looks like that.

202
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,630
因为她嫁了一个傻子
Because she married an idiot.

203
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,500
谢谢你 Raj
Thank you, Raj.

204
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,630
不用这么客气
Please, this is

205
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,360
这是我答谢你们的方式
my way of thanking you

206
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,160
你们都让我住家里了
for letting me stay here.

207
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,100
跟我们说说你今天都干了什么
Now, tell us all about your day.

208
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,200
好的 呃 首先
Okay, um, well, first,

209
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,200
我开会迟到了 因为路上太堵
I was late to a meeting 'cause I was stuck in traffic.

210
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,200
难怪 我跟你说了多少次 把那个路况软件安在手机上
Well, I keep telling you to put that traffic app on your phone.

211
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,100
嘿 当你今天回到家的时候 你跟我抱怨说
Hey, when you got home today complaining that you felt sick

212
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,360
你吃了太多的软糖 肚子难受
from eating too many jelly beans,

213
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,500
我有没有说你不应该吃那么多糖?
did I tell you how to fix it?

214
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,560
没有
No.

215
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,230
我说的是 "哦 很难受吧" 然后我帮你摸摸肚子
I said, "Aw, that must hurt," and I rubbed your belly.

216
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,800
我可是一直想着你的
I thought of you the whole time.

217
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,000
我说的意思是有时候要善于倾听
All I'm saying is there's a time to just listen.

218
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,330
谢谢
Thank you.

219
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,430
而且有些时候
There's also a time to stop

220
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,500
就不要吃那么多软糖了
eating too many jelly beans.

221
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,530
比如十岁以后
And it's when you're ten.

222
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,100
你好 Siebert校长
Hello, President Siebert.

223
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,660
谢谢您接我电话
Thank you for taking my call.

224
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:42,460
我只是想告诉你现在
I just wanted you to know that you can now expect

225
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:46,260
我对自己的科学发现会非常积极
enthusiastic participation from me regarding my discovery.

226
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,500
哦 不不
Oh, no, no, no, no.

227
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,830
不需要谢我
No need to thank me.

228
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,700
谢我的朋友 Wil Wheaton
Thank my friend, Wil Wheaton.

229
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,700
不怕告诉您 我有九个朋友 怎样?
For your information, I have nine friends, hmm?

230
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:59,230
加上你算十个
Ten if we include you.

231
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,300
那还是九个
Nine it is.

232
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
啊 是十个
Ah, it's ten.

233
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,700
Wolowitz也算
I'll count Wolowitz.

234
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:10,630
你好 我的朋友Leonard
Hello, friend Leonard.

235
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,900
嘿 你心情不错啊
Hey, you're in a good mood.

236
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,900
是心情大好
I'm in a great mood.

237
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,730
接下来你会心情更好的
Well, you're about to be in an even better one.

238
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,100
在不确定之前
I didn't want to say anything

239
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,560
我不想说什么 但是...
until I knew for sure, but...

240
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,200
我一直在实验室重现你的元素实验
I've been re-running the tests on your element in my lab

241
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,730
然后推翻了它
and I disproved it.

242
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,400
你的元素是不存在的!
Your element does not exist!

243
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,300
但中国研究队是怎么回事?
Yeah, but what about the Chinese research team?

244
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,360
他们找到了
They found it.

245
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,860
原来是有人向数据文件里
Yeah, it turns out someone added

246
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,230
掺了仿真信号
simulated signals to the data files.

247
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,930
他们伪造了结果
They faked the results.

248
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:34,960
真的?
Really?

249
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,700
没错! 你知道这意味着什么吗?
Yes! Do you know what that means?

250
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,700
意味着你痛恨的这些关注都会烟消云散了
That means all of this attention that you hate goes away.

251
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,930
所以不会有采访了?
So no more interviews?

252
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:41,960
没了 都结束了
No, it's all over.

253
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,060
简直不敢相信
I can't believe it.

254
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:43,960
不用客气
Well, you're welcome.

255
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,960
你抢走了
You robbed me

256
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,760
我最大的成就!
of my greatest achievement!

257
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,900
什么?!
What?!

258
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,730
我现在只有九个朋友了!
I'm back down to nine friends!

259
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:55,060
是八个... 我也讨厌Wolowitz!
Make it eight... I'm sick of Wolowitz, too!

260
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,600
我不明白
I... I don't understand.

261
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,260
自从发现这愚蠢的元素后
All you've done since you discovered

262
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,560
你就一直在抱怨
this stupid element was complain.

263
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,000
我是想让你开心!
I was trying to make you happy!

264
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,630
所以夺走我唯一成名的机会吗?
By taking away my only claim to fame?

265
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,230
如果你想让我开心
Well, if you wanted to make me happy,

266
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,630
你可以给我讲个笑话
you could have told me a joke.

267
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,900
或者给我看一个萌视频
Or shown me a cute video

268
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,960
里面考拉和水獭
of a koala and an otter

269
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,460
不可思议的变成了好朋友
becoming unlikely friends.

270
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:15,960
跟你就没好果子吃
Oh, there is no winning with you.

271
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,330
而且考拉和水獭都不住在一起!
And koalas and otters don't even live near each other!

272
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:21,260
所以说它们的友谊不可思议!
That's what makes their friendship unlikely!

273
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,900
嘿!
Hey!

274
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,200
吵什么呢?
What's with all the yelling?

275
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,330
Leonard证明了我的元素不存在
Leonard disproved my element.

276
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:28,660
现在所有的关注都不会有了
Now all the attention is going to go away.

277
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,160
太棒了 你肯定激动坏了!
Oh, that's great. You must be thrilled!

278
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,530
够了! 我只有七个朋友了
That's it! I'm down to seven friends.

279
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:37,300
他加上了霍比特人和超级英雄 对吧?
He's counting Hobbits and superheroes, right?

280
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,530
当我以为元素存在的时候 我不想要它
When I thought the element was real, I didn't want it.

281
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,360
但现在Leonard让它不存在了
But now that Leonard made it not exist,

282
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,800
我比世界上任何事都想要它
I want it more than anything in the world.

283
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,460
元素本来就不存在的
The... the element never existed.

284
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,160
不是我夺走的 是科学夺走的
I didn't take it away, science took it away.

285
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,360
生科学的气啊
Be mad at science.

286
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,300
不许用科学来对付我
Don't you dare use science against me.

287
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,900
科学是我最好的朋友!
Science is my best friend!

288
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,160
太好了 我又有八个朋友了
Oh, good, I'm back up to eight.

289
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:59,900
你能告诉他他精神失常了吗
Will you tell him he's out of his mind.

290
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,200
其实 我懂他的意思
Actually, I get what he's saying.

291
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,560
太棒了! 九个朋友!
Oh, yes! Nine!

292
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,430
欢迎归队 伙计
Welcome back, buddy.

293
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,830
就像你和你不爱的人恋爱
It's like if you're dating someone you're not that into,

294
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,130
然后和分手了
and then they break up with you,

295
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:10,600
最后发现你又想要他了
and then you want them more than ever.

296
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,330
我不知道她在说什么
I have no idea what she's talking about,

297
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:15,500
但我们是一伙的 所以我同意
but we're ganged up on you so I agree.

298
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,700
好吧 Sheldon 你想让我怎样
Okay, Sheldon, what do you want me to do,

299
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,300
把信息藏起来吗?
hide the information?

300
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,730
如果我不发表
If I don't publish it,

301
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,160
肯定别人会发表 只是时间的问题
it's just a matter of time before someone else does.

302
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,860
不 不 你当然要发表
No, no, of course you have to publish.

303
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,830
那是你身为科学家的职责
That's your responsibility as a scientist.

304
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,460
要不然就没有职业操守了
Doing otherwise would be unethical.

305
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,730
你毫无选择
You have no choice.

306
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,500
好吧 我发表
Fine, I'll publish.

307
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,910
你能相信他吗?
Can you believe this guy?

308
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,400
哇! Raj洗碗啦 
Aw! Raj did the dishes.

309
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,960
你怎么不说是我洗的?
How do you know I didn't do them?

310
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,600
因为有一次 所有刀具都脏的时候
Because once, when all the knives were dirty,

311
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,330
你用钥匙隔开了一个面包圈
you cut a bagel with your keys.

312
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,760
大家早上好哇
Good morning, everybody.

313
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,930
我出去给大家买了咖啡哟
I picked up coffee while I was out.

314
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:59,460
Bernadette 这是你的大豆薄荷摩卡 
Bernadette, here's your soy peppermint mocha.

315
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,630
太谢谢你了
Aw, you didn't have to do that.

316
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,800
没事 别为你的报告
Oh, my pleasure, and don't worry

317
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,860
而担忧哦
about your presentation today.

318
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,160
你会表现很好的
You're gonna be great.

319
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,330
是啊 你会大获成功的 
Yeah, you're gonna knock it out of the park.

320
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,360
我今天的报告是什么?
What presentation do I have today?

321
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,430
快去吧
Just go.

322
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,060
他是爱你哒
He loves you.

323
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,100
你在干嘛?
What are you doing?

324
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,530
想让我难堪吗?
Are you trying to make me look bad?

325
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:22,030
我只是想当个好客人嘛
I'm just being a good house guest.

326
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,500
哪有 你当了比我更好的老公
No, you're being a better husband than I am.

327
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,200
又是洗碗 又是买咖啡
Doing the dishes, getting coffee,

328
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,430
还了解她的生活...
knowing about her life...

329
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,360
这都是谁干的?
Who does that?

330
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,930
得了吧 我也给你买了啊
Oh, come on, I brought you one, too.

331
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:32,660
我不想喝咖啡
I don't want coffee.

332
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,100
所以我给你买了热可可
That's why I got you hot chocolate.

333
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,160
给我吧
Give me that.

334
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,930
别让我难堪了
Just stop showing me up.

335
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:40,430
Howard 听着
Howard, listen to me.

336
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:41,860
你是一个好丈夫
You're a great husband.

337
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,460
你的听话技巧要加强了
Yes, your listening skills could use some work.

338
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:47,660
但你已经很不错了
But it's amazing how far you've come given that you're

339
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:51,130
作为一个有过度保护欲的妈妈的独子
an only child raised by an over-protective mom.

340
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:53,730
这发展好像不太对劲?
Um, is this getting weird?

341
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:54,660
等一下
Hang on.

342
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:01,960
是很奇怪
So, yes.

343
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,110
嘿
Hey.

344
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,800
我只是来告诉你 我...我把研究成果发出去了
I just wanted to let you know that I... I posted my findings.

345
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,030
我看到了
I saw.

346
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,360
我也刚把
And I just

347
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,530
我的论文撤回了
posted a retraction of my paper.

348
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:15,560
现在所有科学界的人都知道我错了
Now the whole scientific community knows I was wrong.

349
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,160
这种事常发生 Sheldon
These things happen all the time, Sheldon.

350
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,400
对我来说不然
Not to me.

351
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,500
仅有一次的撤回是
The only other retraction I ever had to issue

352
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,160
我七岁那年承认我哥是德州东部
was when I was seven and I conceded that my brother

353
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,660
最伟大的忍者
was the greatest ninja in East Texas.

354
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,130
因为我的脸被他的腋窝夹住了
But that was just a ploy to get my face out of his armpit.

355
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,800
你在这啊!
There he is!

356
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,660
我最爱的超级英雄...
It's my favorite superhero...

357
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,330
撤回侠!
the Retractor!

358
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:43,260
好了 别让他难堪
Come on, don't give him a hard time.

359
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,560
不好意思 Cooper
I'm sorry, Cooper.

360
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,630
我撤回刚才说的
I retract it.

361
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,600
随便提一下 Hofstadter 
By the way, Hofstadter,

362
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,030
推翻中国研究队这件事干的不错
nice job disproving the Chinese team.

363
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,160
没什么
It's not a big deal.

364
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,860
当然有什么了
It's a huge deal.

365
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,630
Cooper 也许你不是研究物理的料
Cooper, maybe physics just isn't your thing.

366
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,630
你考虑过去零售业吗?
Have you ever considered a career in retail?

367
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:03,730
那样还能偷偷拿点吃的回家
That way you could take things back for a living.

368
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:06,330
好了 Barry 别说了
Okay, Barry, that's enough.

369
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:07,760
哦 没关系
Oh, no, that's okay.

370
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,800
我能应付的过来
I can fight my own battles.

371
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,700
你说对吧 Bawwy
Isn't that right, "Bawwy."

372
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,700
{\an8}(讽刺他r和w不分)

373
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,330
你...?
Is...?

374
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,760
你这是在讽刺我话说不清吗?
Is that a reference to my speech impediment?

375
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,930
太伤人了
That's pretty hurtful.

376
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,360
我...
I...

377
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,230
我又不想那样
I can't control it.

378
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:28,900
你说得对
You're right,

379
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,900
我过分了
That was uncalled for.

380
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,330
我收回那句话
I take it back.

381
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,330
你当然要收回了
Of course you do.

382
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,200
因为你是撤回侠!
Because you're the Retractor!

383
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,860
Raj 晚餐太美味了
Raj, this dinner was amazing.

384
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,030
如果你多住几天
If you're here much longer,

385
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:45,000
我都得买大一号的衣服了
I'm gonna have to buy bigger clothes.

386
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
怎么会
Nonsense.

387
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,230
你应该长点肉
You need a little fattening up.

388
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:49,130
你最近太瘦了
You've been looking too skinny lately.

389
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,530
啊
Aw.

390
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:53,030
Howie 你怎么就不能像人家那样会说话?
Howie, how come you never say anything sweet like that?

391
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,030
怎么回事?
What are you talking about?

392
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,260
还记得上周吗? 我以为
Remember last week, when I asked you

393
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,600
你穿了紧身裤但你没穿
if you were wearing Spanx and you weren't?

394
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,760
我怎么不会说话了?
How's that different?

395
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:01,900
也许你可以学学你朋友Raj那样
Maybe you could try being more thoughtful,

396
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,530
更体贴一点
like your friend Raj.

397
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:06,030
哦 好吧 也许你该像Raj学学
Yeah, well, maybe you could try being more like Raj.

398
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,060
哦 是吗?
Oh, really?

399
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,100
嗯 嗯
Yeah, yeah.

400
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,560
今天早上他给我带了爱心便当
He packed me a lunch this morning.

401
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,700
里面还有一张字条 写着"加油哟"
And there was a note inside that said, "Go get 'em."

402
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,230
你这么说 像我做的不够多似的
Like I don't do enough around here.

403
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,560
还要我给你做便当?
Now I need to pack your lunch?

404
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,300
再说了 你是成年人了!
And by the way, why do you need a note telling you

405
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,660
还要写着"加油哟"的字条干嘛!
to "go get 'em"? You're a grown man!

406
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,800
你自己应该知道"加油"的!
You should know to "go get 'em"!

407
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:23,300
我知道要"加油"
I do know to "go get 'em,"

408
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,900
但在我加油的时候
but sometimes it's nice to have emotional support

409
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,360
能得到一点鼓励更好!
when I'm going and getting them!

410
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,860
嘿 嘿 你们说什么呢?
Hey, hey, do you hear yourselves?

411
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:33,060
都冷静一下 各让一步吧
Let's just, you know, all calm down and take a step back.

412
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,200
太傻了
This is stupid.

413
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,400
我们为什么要吵架?
Why are we fighting?

414
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,430
不知道
I don't know.

415
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:38,860
我就是觉得
I guess I was just feeling

416
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,700
我是个坏丈夫
like I'm a lousy husband.

417
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,200
你才不是坏丈夫
You're not a lousy husband.

418
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,560
你是个好丈夫
You're a great husband.

419
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,760
我才是讨厌的妻子
I was the one feeling like a lousy wife.

420
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,000
说什么呢? 你是最好的妻子
Are you kidding? You're the best.

421
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,560
我知道问题所在了
I know what the problem is.

422
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,100
都怪他!
It's him!

423
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,230
哦 我做什么了?
Oh, what did I do?

424
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,560
你想挑拨我们俩
You made us feel like we're not trying hard enough.

425
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,230
嗯 我们正努力磨合婚姻
Yeah, we were totally fine half-assing our marriage

426
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:00,160
但你一出现就都乱了
till you showed up.

427
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,860
听着 很抱歉惹你们生气了
Look, I'm sorry you're upset with me,

428
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,500
但我只是想说 我很开心
but I just have to say it's nice to see

429
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,060
你们俩终于一条战线了
the two of you on the same page.

430
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,800
哦 有你支持我
Oh, it does feel good

431
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,330
我真是太开心了
to have you backing me up for once.

432
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:10,960
我一直都很支持你!
I back you up all the time!

433
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,130
不对... 他又来了! 你怎么回事?!
That is not... he's doing it again! What is wrong with you?!

434
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,330
他们竟然把你赶出来了
I can't believe they kicked you out.

435
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:20,960
他俩竟然还没离婚
I can't believe they're still married.

436
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,500
哦 不 我把Cinnamon的牙刷落在Howard家了
Oh, no, I forgot Cinnamon's toothbrush at Howard's.

437
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,030
那你就和爹地用一把吧
I guess you're sharing with Daddy again.

438
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:34,500
你嗷一声我就帮你联系善待动物组织
Bark once if you need me to call PETA.

439
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:40,260
咱公寓里怎么多了个这货
What's that animal doing in our apartment?

440
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,460
没事的 她在笼子里跑不出来
Oh, relax, she's in her crate. She can't get out.

441
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,230
我提醒你一下
I have two words for you:

442
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,260
{\an8}(恐龙冲出围栏)

443
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,260
侏罗纪公园
Jurassic Park.

444
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:49,530
今天真是越来越糟了
This day just keeps getting worse and worse.

445
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:51,000
如果能让你稍微高兴点...
You know, if it makes you feel any better...

446
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,960
应该不会的
It probably won't.

447
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,030
你说得对
You're probably right.

448
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:56,200
Sheldon 夜色如此美好
Sheldon, it's a beautiful night.

449
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,800
咱俩要不去散散步
Why don't you and I go for a nice walk together?

450
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,160
你怎么随时随地都想那档子事啊
Oh, everything is just sex with you isn't it?

451
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,400
Sheldon 我觉得如果你能认识到
Sheldon, I think you might find the support

452
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,030
恋爱中有付出也有回报
you're looking for, if you realize

453
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:09,160
你就会得到想要的支持
that relationships are a give and take.

454
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,630
你给她一个拥抱
She can only be there for you

455
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,500
她才会还你一个港湾
as much as you are for her.

456
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,400
多谢 Rajesh
Thank you, Rajesh.

457
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,700
Amy 你也得耐心对待Sheldon
And, Amy, you need to be patient with Sheldon,

458
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:20,230
不要总逼着他跟你进行亲密接触
instead of pressuring him to accept intimacy on your terms.

459
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,500
你还是走吧
You should probably go.

460
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,330
我是Ira Flatow 现在您收听的是科学星期五
I'm Ira Flatow, and this is Science Friday.

461
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:37,760
首先欢迎Sheldon Cooper博士的回归
I'd like to welcome back Dr. Sheldon Cooper,

462
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,930
他以为自己发现了
who thought he had discovered

463
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:42,600
一种新的超重元素 却被下一位来宾推翻
a new super-heavy element only to have it disproved

464
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,200
那就是Leonard Hofstadter博士
by my next guest, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

465
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,260
您好 欢迎来到科学星期五
Welcome to Science Friday, gentlemen.

466
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,700
- 谢谢  - 谢谢
- Thanks.  - Thank you.

467
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,230
Ira 你不介意的话
Ira, if I may, I'd like to apologize

468
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:52,260
我想为上周道个歉
for my behavior last week.

469
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,930
没关系
It's all right.

470
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:57,130
那 你有没有什么要对我说的?
Now, isn't there something you'd like to say to me?

471
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,100
没
No.

472
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,760
Hofstadter博士
Now, Dr. Hofstadter.

473
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,060
你能不能跟我们讲讲
Can you walk us through the process

474
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,000
你是如何推翻他的结论的?
you used to disprove his theory?

475
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,700
这个... 我可以回答
Well... I believe I can answer that.

476
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,630
他问的是我
He asked me.

477
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:11,900
好吧
Fine.

478
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,930
正如我说的...
As I was saying...

479
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,430
你说错了 Ira...
You're telling it wrong. Ira...

480
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,460
这件事要说个明白
to really understand the story here,

481
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,030
我得从头说起
you have to start at the very beginning:

482
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:21,060
在德州东边的一个小镇上 一位少年天才...
A small town in East Texas, where a young genius named...

483
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,930
- Sheldon...  - 对 他叫Sheldon Cooper
- Sheldon...  - That's right, Sheldon Cooper.

484
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:26,200
他被领居家的狗咬伤了
He was bitten by his neighbor's dog,

485
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,060
激发他做出了他人生中第一个科学成果...
leading to his first scientific breakthrough...

486
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,260
狗狗死亡射线
the doggie death-ray.

487
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,700
但因为圣诞老人给不了浓缩铀
Which, sadly, he couldn't build

488
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,530
这个成果没能实现
because Santa wouldn't bring him enriched uranium.

489
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:38,300
我比较想听Hofstadter博士来说
I mean, I'd really like to hear it from Dr. Hofstadter,

490
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,600
如果你不介意的话
if it's okay with you.

491
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,560
真奇怪
What a surprise.

492
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,260
你... 请我过来就是无视我的吗?
Did... did you invite me back just so you could ignore me?

493
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,100
其实 我也没请你吧
Actually, I didn't invite you.

494
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,600
你就这么走进来坐下了
You came in, you took a seat,

495
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,460
我也不想跟你对质
and I'm not comfortable with confrontation.

496
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,700
Sheldon 这是对我的采访
Sheldon, this interview is supposed to be about me.

497
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,480
无趣得我都要打哈欠了
Well, that seems like a snooze.

498
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,730
虽说是广播电台节目吧
Even for public radio.

499
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:01,560
如果每次他们说些丢人的话
You know, if we did a shot every time

500
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,760
我们就喝一杯
they said something embarrassing,

501
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,900
那我们肯定喝嗨了
this would be one hell of a drinking game.

502
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,100
现在喝酒太早了吧
A little early for alcohol, isn't it?

503
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,900
我不止在科学上颇有建树
You know, I don't just say smart things about science.

504
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,400
我还会约德尔腔
I also yodel.

505
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:18,500
我去拿伏特加
I'll get the vodka.

506
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,500
