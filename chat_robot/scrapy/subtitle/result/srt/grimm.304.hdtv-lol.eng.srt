1
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:09,030
"More and more she grew to love human beings and wished
that she could leave the sea and live among them."

2
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:21,090
* Ice-cold beer everybody's here tonight *

3
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:27,640
* ice-cold beer everybody's here tonight *

4
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:31,870
Wow, that was so bad, you guys.
I think I threw up in my mouth a little.

5
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,740
We probably scared all of the fish away.

6
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,920
I never catch anything anyway.
What, two beautiful women don't rate?

7
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,360
You kidding me? Pretty thing like you, you're not even a keeper.

8
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,380
I should toss you in right now.

9
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,190
So I'm gonna get some more beer.

10
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:52,370
Okay.

11
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,110
That's good.

12
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:03,160
Ooh, boy.

13
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:07,340
Oh, what do you want?

14
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,160
No, no, no, no.

15
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,360
You little pervert!

16
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,320
What do you think you're doing?

17
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:28,300
NOTHING. I WAS JUST GOING FOR A WALK

18
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:32,800
You were not just walking around. I saw you spying on us.

19
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,620
I'm gonna tell dad.

20
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,300
NO

21
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,900
YOU CAN'T

22
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:41,040
If you don't want me to tell him, you need to get your butt outta here.

23
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,440
NOT HIM

24
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,640
ANYBODY BUT HIM

25
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:54,090
What do you care about Jake?
I mean, he doesn't even know that you exist.

26
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,590
I LOVE HIM

27
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:01,450
Look, you're never going to be the same as them, you know,

28
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,480
so you need to stop trying to become something that you're not.

29
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,210
Now, go.

30
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,240
What, no beer?

31
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,030
Changed my mind.

32
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,930
What's the matter? 

33
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,410
You scared of me?

34
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,550
That was incredible.

35
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,110
You're incredible.
You're not so bad yourself.

36
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,530
No!

37
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:13,120
No! Help! Help!

38
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,440
- Get out of the water! - What's going on?

39
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,310
Get out!
Help!

40
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:21,690
Dan!

41
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,830
Dan!

Dan.

46
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:49,920
Dan!

47
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,830
Dan! Dan!

48
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,660
Well,

49
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:59,060
this is the last of your stuff.

50
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,880
Are you sure this is a good idea?
Whoa, wait, what?

51
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,570
Of course this is a good idea. This is a great idea,

52
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:07,730
- 'cause you and I... - No, no.

53
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,780
- What? - Not that.

54
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:13,490
I'm just... I'm saying I-I have so much stuff,

55
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:16,460
and your house suddenly seems a lot smaller.

56
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,010
No, there's plenty of room. Plus, look.

57
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:23,280
It's a golden opportunity for me to get rid of some stuff.
What are you going to get rid of?

58
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,570
Oh, you kidding? Any number of... like...

59
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,130
or...

60
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,440
you know, like this, for example.

61
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,960
Well, that's a start.

62
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,440
This was presented personally to my great, great Uncle Bernard by Sigmund Riefler himself

63
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,690
when Bernard retired from the clemens Riefler clock works in Munich.

64
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,690
Sigmund was the son of the founder clemens Riefler,

65
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:48,420
but it was actually Sigmund who invented the Riefler escapement,

66
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,220
which is a mechanical device for precision pendulum clocks.

67
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,150
And I actually have one right over there.

68
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,530
So...

69
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:00,440
I think everything should stay right where it is.

70
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,940
Even me.

71
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,160
I cut up some fruit. You want some?

72
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,620
Yeah, please, and a lot of coffee.

73
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,780
Got you covered.

74
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:29,890
What?

75
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,630
Nothing.

76
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,380
That's what makes this so great.

77
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,390
Yeah, I really missed all this, like, everyday stuff.

78
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:45,100
I missed that too.
See you after work.

79
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:50,300
Hey, hey, what about the doctor's reports?
Oh, he was supposed to send me the email yesterday.

80
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,210
Just check my email, see if it came in.

81
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,350
Tell me if I'm still alive.

82
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:59,060
Gillnetter out on government island fished him out of the river this morning.

83
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,380
I cross-checked with missing persons.

84
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,420
A report was filed yesterday matching his description,

85
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,410
name listed as Daniel Hopkins.

86
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:11,160
Same as we got.
Report also lists as a possible assault.

87
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:14,470
Looks pretty beat up.
Probably from river debris.

88
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:20,100
I don't know about these marks on his ankles.
Yeah, same here too, like scratches.

89
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,260
Yeah, scratches or claws.
Maybe something pulled him under.

90
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,620
What are we talking, a loch ness monster?

91
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,650
- Who filed the report? - Uh, Jake Barnes.

92
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:33,010
Filed last night at 9:15.
Let's talk to him.

93
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,020
One second.

94
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,310
- Jake Barnes? - Yeah.

95
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,990
I'm Detective Burkhardt. This is Detective Griffin.

96
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:49,790
You filed a missing persons report for Daniel Hopkins.
Oh, God, did you find him?

97
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,400
Mind if we talk inside?

98
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,380
Yeah, sure.

99
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,980
So did he make it out?

100
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,570
Afraid not, they discovered Dan's body this morning.

101
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,030
Oh, man.

102
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,580
Oh, man, I was afraid of this.

103
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,660
You know, he was... he was pulled underwater.

104
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,610
By what?
I don't know, I just saw something, it got me too.

105
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:23,430
All right, we're gonna need you to go over everything that happened yesterday...

106
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:26,340
where you were, who was there, anything you can remember.

107
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:30,330
Oh, jeez.
He's really dead, I can't believe this.

108
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:34,140
All right, was anyone else there with you?
No, not at first.

109
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,210
We were fishing up near steelhead,

110
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,960
and... and then these two girls showed up.

111
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,720
- You get their names? - Mm-hmm. Sarah and Anna.

112
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,070
They were sisters, I didn't... I'm sorry,

113
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:47,890
I didn't get their last name.
You must have got a number, right?

114
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:50,440
I never had a chance.
I mean, one thing led to another.

115
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,190
Did things get sexual?

116
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,840
Yeah.
Who were you with?

117
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,080
Sarah. Dan was with Anna.

118
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,860
We were all in the river. Sarah and I...

119
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,910
Anyway, afterwards, we were swimming, and...

120
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:09,150
that's when I heard Dan.

121
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,990
He was screaming, and Anna looked really scared,

122
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:14,770
and she was yelling for us to get out of the river, and... 

123
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:19,260
And then something... something pulled him under.

124
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,160
Did you try to get to him?
Of course, but...

125
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,410
I mean, and then something pulled me under too.

126
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,650
And then that's the last thing I remember.

127
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,710
Look, I told all this to the police last night.

128
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,400
I don't think they believed me.

129
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,790
How'd you manage to get out?

130
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:42,670
I'm not sure.

131
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,960
I mean, all I know is there was this...

132
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,250
This what?

133
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:53,200
Girl, I think, but you know,
I mean, I'm not even sure she was real, man.

134
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,780
I mean, I was still just trying to breathe.

135
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,600
It wasn't Sarah or Anna?
No, this one was younger,

136
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,750
but I don't know, man, I don't know what I saw.

137
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,270
How'd you get those scratches?

138
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:09,610
I'm telling you, I mean, it felt like something, like, grabbed me.

139
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:13,610
Okay, what kind of something?
I mean, it's a little hard to focus when you're drowning.

140
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,880
Why don't you take us to the place where this all happened?

141
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:19,540
My car was parked behind these trees.
We came down here and made a campfire.

142
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:23,530
My clothes were right here, Dan's too.
I mean, I looked all up and down the river for him.

143
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,850
I should have gone in after him, but after what happened...

144
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,940
Is this where you went into the river?
Yes.

145
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:32,440
And where'd you get pulled out?
Down there, I guess.

146
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,280
What happened to the girls you were with?

147
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,280
I don't know, I...

148
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,830
I mean, I thought maybe they got grabbed too,
but then their clothes were gone when I came to.

149
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:43,820
You said there was another girl that pulled you out.
What happened to her?

150
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:47,900
Uh, I think she ran off as soon as I was out of the river.

151
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,630
Now, when'd you call 911?
Soon as I got back up here.

152
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:53,040
I couldn't find my phone, so I used Dan's.

153
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:57,510
How'd the girls get here?
Uh, just from back there.

154
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,680
- You didn't see a car? - No.

155
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,210
Hank!

156
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,500
Police!

157
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,400
Stop!

158
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,780
I'm not gonna hurt you!

159
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,950
What happened?
She dove in.

160
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:45,290
- You see her come up? - Yeah, about 50 yards out.

161
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:48,940
She swam all that way underwater?
What are we dealing with?

162
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:52,170
Hey, hey, I think that's the girl I saw when I came up.

163
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:54,610
- Where'd she go? - I'm not sure.

164
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:01,480
River patrol didn't find any bodies matching Jake's description of Sarah, Anna,

165
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,580
or the girl Nick saw jump into the river.

166
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:07,070
They're probably still alive. Somebody went back to the campsite and took the sisters' clothes.

167
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:11,070
Jake said they were scared.
They probably got out of the river, grabbed their stuff, and ran.

168
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:15,380
The girl I saw go into the river was a lot more than a girl when she got under the water.

169
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:18,070
- You know what she was? - Not yet.

170
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:20,600
Let's round up the unusual suspects.

171
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,680
SENT YOU PHOTO

172
00:13:58,010 --> 00:13:58,830
Oui?

173
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,010
ARE YOU ALONE

174
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:01,780
I CAN TALK

175
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,110
YOU RECEIVED THE PHOTO?

176
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,270
Adalind.

177
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:08,350
THE SACHER HOTEL ROOM NUMBER I FOUND AT FRAU PECH'S...

178
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,570
..IT'S ADALIND'S ROOM

179
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,020
SHE WAS DOING BUSINESS WITH FRAU PECH?

180
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,160
APPARENTLY

181
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,700
FRAU PECH MIGHT HAVE APPROACHED HER KNOWING SHE WAS A LAWYER FOR THE FAMILY

182
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,730
IN ORDER TO GET AROUND ME AND MAKE A DEAL FOR THE CHILD

183
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,660
DID MY BROTHER KNOW ABOUT THIS

184
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,260
I NEVER HAD A CHANCE TO TELL HIM

185
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:29,660
WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHO'S SELLING THE BABY

186
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,920
OR WHOSE CHILD IT IS

187
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:39,220
UNLESS ADALIND APPROACHED FRAU PECH TO MAKE THE DEAL

188
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,200
ADALIND

189
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:46,310
SHE MIGHT BE THE ONE WHO'S GOING TO HAVE A CHILD WITH ROYAL BLOOD TO SELL

190
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:49,950
In the river?

191
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,940
You know, I'm not really that much of a water person.

192
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:55,270
I'm really more of a Mountain and land kind of lubber.

193
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:59,860
There was this girl I knew in Seattle, she was a naiad, lived out on Bainbridge island.

194
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:03,210
She's was kind of weird, nice, though.

195
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:06,530
But she could swim, man, like a fish.

196
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:09,110
Uh, naiad?

197
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,840
Oh, naiads. Yeah, no, I've heard of naiads.

198
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:16,000
I've never seen one, though.
What are they, like, a water nymph or something?

199
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,710
Sort of. Very close-knit families.
They never stray far from the water.

200
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:24,060
That's probably why Jake can't describe who saved him.
I bet you'd have something about them in your trailer.

201
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,720
Well, at least we have an idea of what we're dealing with now.

202
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,560
Yeah.

203
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:36,290
Right, we should be going.
Looks like you guys have a lot left to do.

204
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:38,180
Yeah, we do. We sure do.

205
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,210
Hey, you know, but if you guys need any help, you know, in the trailer...

206
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:46,700
I mean, I probably shouldn't leave with so much left to do.

207
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,330
- Go ahead. - Are you sure?

208
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:53,070
I mean, it's not gonna take that long.
Please, take him.

209
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,420
Thanks.

210
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:07,080
Oh, listen to this, it's dated 1755.

211
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,660
Looks like a Grimm working for the East India company.

212
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:14,500
"A strange event aboard the merchant vessel Doddington.

213
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:18,380
"Jory, our third mate, disappeared overnight.

214
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:21,580
"The rest of the crew grows superstitious.

215
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:27,840
"Recently, Jory had taken to raving "about a beautiful woman

216
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,280
"swimming alongside our ship like a fish.

217
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,650
"I have decided to stand the man's watch "as we round the cape

218
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:38,830
"to see if there is any truth to these rumors.

219
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:44,210
"It turns out Jory was no lunatic.

220
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:48,390
"I saw the creature known to my kin as the naiad.

221
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:52,760
"After capturing it in a net, "I was able to haul the creature aboard,

222
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,490
"where she donned her human shape.

223
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,220
"I find her mesmerizing

224
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:01,710
"and have kept her hidden from the Captain and crew.

225
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,500
"After some hours on board,

226
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,720
"the woman's skin began to dry and peel.

227
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,460
"She begs me to return her to the sea,

228
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:15,120
"but I am determined to prove Jory true.

229
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,680
"I have questioned her regarding his disappearance,

230
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,120
"but she refuses to betray any secrets of her kind

231
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,080
and only pleads to be let back into the water."

232
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,550
"At sunrise this morning, the creature died

233
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,490
"from what I assume was severe dehydration.

234
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:37,980
"I'm afraid whatever secrets the naiad was keeping have died with her."

235
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:39,860
It's wu.

236
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,470
Got something for us?

237
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:45,310
We ran the number from Jake Barnes' missing cell phone.

238
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:48,070
GPS puts it at the andersen marina.

239
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:50,040
That's not far up the river from where they went swimming.

240
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,390
How you want to handle this?
Meet us at the marina.

241
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,020
We should bring Jake along in case he can I.D. whoever took the phone.

242
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,550
- You ever been here? - No.

243
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:10,910
You know anybody who lives here?
Not that I know of.

244
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:13,720
- Stay in the car. - See if you recognize anybody.

245
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,700
The phone's still on...

246
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,620
In one of these houseboats.

247
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,290
Looks like this one here.

248
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:45,440
Sir, I'm Detective Burkhardt. This is Detective Griffin.

249
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,240
We're following up an investigation about a drowning.

250
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,580
Need to ask you a few questions. Who drowned?

251
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:54,520
Can I have your name, sir?
Abel Mahario.

252
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,500
I don't know anybody who drowned.
We're tracking a stolen cell phone.

253
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,980
It was taken from where the victim went into the river.

254
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,910
The signal led us here. Mind if we take a look inside?

255
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:06,430
I haven't done anything wrong, and I told you I don't know anybody who drowned, 

256
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,790
so this must be a mistake.

257
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,790
Should be easy enough to find out.

258
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,640
Calling the stolen cell phone now.

259
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:19,090
That sounds like probable cause to me.
We're going inside, sir.

260
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,380
Sir, will you stay right here?

261
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,990
So how'd Jake's phone get in here?

262
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,240
Girl on the left looks like the one I chased into the river.

263
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,080
- The naiad? - Let's find out.

264
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,520
Sir, do you want to take a crack at how this cell phone got in your house?

265
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,260
I have no idea how it got there.
This girl, is she your daughter?

266
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,500
Why? Elly didn't do anything.

267
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,480
She may have been in the area at the time of the drowning.
We need talk to her, see if she saw anything.

268
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,460
Well, you can't talk to her.
Sir, this is a police investigation.

269
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:19,120
She's deaf, so unless one of you can sign...

270
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,850
Hey, Sarah. Sarah.

271
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,420
Sarah, hey. Yeah, it's me, Jake.

272
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,010
Sarah, hey.

273
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,520
Hey, hey, hey. Whoa, guys.

274
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,300
Guys, guys, wait. Whoa, hold on.

275
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,210
Look, they found Dan's body.
I don't know what you're talking about.

276
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:52,360
Dan, he drowned. The police are here.

277
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:56,090
- We have to go. - Wait, I'm sorry, did you hear what I just said? 

278
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,680
Dan's dead!
Why don't you just leave us alone?

279
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:02,760
Guys, these are the girls I was telling you about. Sarah and Anna.

280
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,990
Sarah, Anna, get in the house.

281
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:06,430
Everyone's gonna stay right here until we're done questioning them.

282
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:08,550
- Who was with Dan? - Anna. I was swimming with Sarah.

283
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,680
I don't know what he's talking about.
What, are you crazy?

284
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,870
Look, we were together yesterday.
All right, we're gonna need to see some identification.

285
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:16,610
My girls didn't do anything wrong.
I.Ds. 

286
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,130
Now, you wanna tell us where you were yesterday afternoon and evening?

287
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:22,670
- We were here with our dad. - They were with me and Dan.

288
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:25,380
Anna?
Hey, what the hell's going on here?

289
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,730
It's a police investigation, sir.
I need you to stop right there.

290
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:29,170
Investigation of what?

291
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:30,940
- Who are you? - We live over there.

292
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:34,930
Then I suggest you go home and stay out of it,
unless you want my sergeant to put you in the back of his car.

293
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:37,640
I already told you, my girls were home last night.

294
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:42,280
You recognize this girl?
Yeah, I mean, that looks like the girl who saved me.

295
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,410
You want to explain how this cell phone got in your house?

296
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,780
That's my phone. They had my phone?

297
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,140
Fine, you don't want to explain here, I get it.

298
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,300
Sarah, Anna, you go back to the precinct with us.

299
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,040
Let's go. This way, please.

300
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:56,810
Anyone else want to go?

301
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,430
Let's get back in the car.

302
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,140
Listen, you can't do this.

303
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:13,570
Sir, we can make the same arrangements for you,
unless you want to clear this up right now.

304
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:15,380
You don't understand.

305
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:23,040
Well, I guess we have more to talk about than I thought.

306
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:25,960
But I'm going to talk to your daughters first,

307
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,590
give you some time to think about it.

308
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:34,720
Damn it.

309
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:39,250
I told you I didn't want this kind of trouble.
Why did you do it?

310
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,760
Because you forgot where you come from. We haven't.

311
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,170
I haven't forgotten anything.
I know what it takes for us to survive.

312
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:48,450
Your world died 200 years ago,

313
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,890
and now you've jeopardized all of us with this fundamental crap!

314
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:55,930
It was Elly, your daughter.
She pulled him out.

315
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:59,040
Which is how that phone got in your house.
She has to be cut.

316
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:02,730
Are you crazy? Nobody does that anymore.

317
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:05,790
Where we're from, they do, and we don't have these kinds of troubles.

318
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,690
And this is your fault, old man.

319
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,760
This is what happens when you don't raise your women right.

320
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:15,080
No, no, wait.
Please, she's just a girl.

321
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:18,120
I'm not gonna let you touch her.

322
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,440
Who's gonna stop us?

323
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,210
Jake says this is the girl that pulled him out.

324
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,670
You want to tell us what happened?

325
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:42,790
We're the only two here who know what you and your sister are.

326
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:46,180
I don't know what you're talking about.
You're naiads.

327
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:51,780
You really want to spend the next 24 hours drying out in a holding cell?

328
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:54,310
'Cause that's where you're going if you don't start talking.

329
00:23:56,510 --> 00:24:00,080
I have nothing to say.
Well, let's hope your sister does.

330
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:10,050
Jake saw Dan pulled under.

331
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,490
Jake is only alive because Elly saved him.

332
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:21,320
That means you either saw what happened or were involved with what happened.

333
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,050
You need to tell us, Anna.

334
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:30,640
Because I know naiads can only be out of the water for so long.

335
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:39,260
And you will die in here if you don't start talking.

336
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,630
Who pulled Jake under the water?

337
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,120
Who killed Dan?

338
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:57,090
Knowing what they are and what will happen to them, we don't want to keep them locked up.

339
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:58,720
But they're not giving us much choice.

340
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,340
At the very least, they know what happened and didn't report it. So they might know who did it.

341
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:05,470
That's the problem, we think they're protecting somebody.

342
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:09,710
How much time do you think they have?
I doubt they'll survive the night.

343
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:13,210
And what about the girl who saved your victim from the river? Can't find her.

344
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:18,170
So how do we explain two dead women in our holding cells?
We can't very well say they're naiads.

345
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:22,010
We'll get blamed for something we had no control over.
And they're playing a very serious game.

346
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:25,310
If they're involved, what do we do, just let 'em go?

347
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:28,440
No. This is their problem, not ours.

348
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,920
If they choose to die, we let the M.E. explain it.

349
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:35,010
Just 'cause they're wesen, it doesn't entitle them to special treatment.

350
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,070
Yeah?

351
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:42,110
Girls' father, Abel Mahario, is here.

352
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:44,070
Apparently, he wants to talk.

353
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:47,950
I killed that boy. I did it.

354
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,850
You need to arrest me and let my daughters go.

355
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:53,790
- How'd you kill him? - I drowned him.

356
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:57,050
Why?
I have my reasons.

357
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:58,800
I know you didn't do it for a cell phone.

358
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:03,320
We know you want to save your girls, but we'd rather leave here with whoever's really responsible.

359
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,070
I am! I told you I did it!

360
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:08,040
I-I pulled him underwater!

361
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,850
- Were your daughters there too? - No.

362
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:12,300
- Jake Barnes says they were. - Well, he's lying.

363
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,590
Why would he lie?

364
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,060
He just saw them.

365
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,290
Then they were there?

366
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:23,630
I saw those two boys attacking my daughters, and I did what I had to.

367
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:26,030
So you're telling us you were saving your daughters?

368
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:27,630
They were being raped.

369
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:31,820
Then why did your other daughter pull Jake out of the water?

370
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:34,420
Who gave you the black eye?
Did you know she was there too?

371
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,810
What time did you get there?

372
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:38,630
- How did you get there? - You walk? Take a car?

373
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:41,020
What did the other guy look like, the one you killed?

374
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:44,120
Was he tall, short, fat, black, white?

375
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,530
We need some details here.
Why don't you take us to the place where it happened?

376
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:50,450
You see how difficult this gets when you're not telling the truth?

377
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:52,000
Why does it matter?

378
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,940
I'm offering my life for my daughters'.

379
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:04,650
Not easy being a parent.
Yeah, but it could be what we need.

380
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:07,090
Those girls may be ready to throw their own lives away,

381
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,410
but they might not be so willing when it's their dad's life they're dealing with.

382
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:13,680
Use his confession as leverage?
Might be just as tough being a daughter.

383
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:17,030
I guess we'll find out if it's a loving family.

384
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:59,060
You're the one who saved my life.

385
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,720
What's your name?

386
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,780
Elly.

387
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:06,650
Elly?

388
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,350
Okay.

389
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,620
What are you doing here, Elly?

390
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:19,090
Oh, you're deaf?

391
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,940
But you can read my lips?

392
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Okay.

393
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,540
You know, I almost thought I imagined you.

394
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:44,290
Um, the police need to talk to you.

395
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,570
The police, they're looking for you.

396
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:55,820
What are you doing?
You want to show me something?

397
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:59,270
Something about you? Okay.

398
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,630
What are you doing?

399
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,930
You want to go swimming?

400
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,980
Huh? Now?

401
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,370
Elly.

402
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:35,430
Oh, my God.

403
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:41,890
You... you're what I saw.

404
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:43,630
My God, you're real?

405
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,410
No!

406
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:50,540
No! No!

407
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,060
NO

408
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,500
Hey! What's going on down there?

409
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,840
- Mm! - We gotta go.

410
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:19,670
The last in a long line of boxes.

411
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:21,690
What have we here?

412
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:24,580
Oh, I'm not sure. That was in my brother's apartment.

413
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,450
This is really...

414
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,640
It-it's interesting. Oh, wow!

415
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,700
I have not seen that since I was a kid.

416
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:38,700
Belonged to my grandparents.
They brought it with them from Holland.

417
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:42,850
Well, in that case,

418
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:46,530
it should sit in a place of honor.

419
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,820
Hey. Don't try so hard.

420
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,460
I know this is a big deal for you and me, moving in together,

421
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,740
but we have to be honest.

422
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,440
That is butt ugly.

423
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,770
- I know, but... - But what?

424
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:07,330
I mean, maybe there's things of mine that you don't like.

425
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,910
What are you afraid of?

426
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,450
Me.

427
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:14,330
Why?

428
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,330
There have been other... you know,

429
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:20,830
but no one I ever even considered moving in with.

430
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:22,380
Are you getting cold feet?

431
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:25,140
No. God, no. I knew it would sound like that.

432
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,160
Stop.

433
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,260
It's okay. It's all going to be okay.

434
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,590
I just didn't want you to think...

435
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,190
- stop thinking. - Mm.

436
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:35,800
I love you, you love me,

437
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:40,280
and we both hate this.

438
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,840
And if you can't build a relationship on hate...

439
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,760
Right, then... I mean, what do you have?

440
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,920
Us.

441
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:57,860
Your father confessed to everything.

442
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,970
You are free to go. What?

443
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:02,880
What did... what did he confess to?

444
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,900
The murder of Dan Hopkins and the attempted murder of Jake Barnes.

445
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:09,190
- That's a lie. - You think we'd be letting you go if we didn't have a confession?

446
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:12,070
No. This isn't right.

447
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:14,040
Sarah, they're letting us go.

448
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:17,200
And arresting dad? He'll die here.

449
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,830
We can talk about this at home.
It's dad, Anna.

450
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:22,810
Sarah, don't.

451
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:30,190
Dominic did it.

452
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:32,810
- Dominic? - And Jesse too.

453
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:35,270
It's those two guys from the marina.

454
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:38,530
They'll kill us, Sarah.

455
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:51,280
You don't have much time left. We need to get you out of here.

456
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:57,210
Sarah, he's a Grimm. You can't trust him.

457
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,270
I have no choice.

458
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:02,820
Let's go.

459
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,510
Anna, come on.

460
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:12,930
We didn't even know they were there.
Dominic and Jesse?

461
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,830
They must have been waiting for us in the river.

462
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:20,950
Dominic pulled Dan under, and Jesse pulled Jake.

463
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:25,070
Why?
It was time to start our families.

464
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:29,280
You start your families by killing two innocent victims?
That wasn't supposed to happen.

465
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:33,010
In the old days, maybe, but we don't do that anymore.

466
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:35,180
At least we didn't...

467
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:40,300
Till Dominic and Jesse showed up about six months ago.

468
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,750
- From where? - Alaska.

469
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,180
Did you know them prior to that?

470
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:47,820
No. Our relationships are arranged.

471
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:52,310
Dominic and Jesse come from a family that believe in all of these...

472
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,640
Old traditions.

473
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,010
We didn't think that they would actually do anything,

474
00:33:57,010 --> 00:34:00,580
we just... we just thought they were talking.

475
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:02,310
This is some kind of ritual?

476
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,880
I think that's what they want us to think,

477
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:09,410
but it's more about revenge.

478
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:16,950
We can only conceive and give birth in the water.

479
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:20,160
Naiad men are born sterile.

480
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:24,750
They know we have to mate with other men. Otherwise, we'll die out.

481
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:27,680
I mean, they're not very happy about it, but neither are we.

482
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:31,090
Well, I can see where that may cause a little bit of tension.

483
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:34,760
Our men have to raise the children of other men.

484
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,610
I mean, some of them are okay with it, but...

485
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,240
Others aren't so... Accepting.

486
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:48,850
It's Jake. Hello?

487
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,980
Detective Burkhardt? It's Jake.

488
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:54,300
She was just here, the girl who saved me.

489
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,440
- Where are you? - At my apartment. She was in the pool.

490
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,870
Those two guys from the marina, they jumped me and took her.

491
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:03,430
Stay where you are.
We're gonna send some uniforms your way.

492
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:08,720
Jesse and Dominic beat up Jake.
Elly was there, and they took her.

493
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,610
Oh, my God, they're gonna cut her.

494
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:13,890
- What? - They'll cut the telae between her fingers and toes.

495
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:17,480
It's how they used to banish those that broke our laws.
Where would they take her?

496
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,420
- Where they can make an example

497
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,810
Home.

498
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:30,370
You left us no other choice.
I know you can understand me.

499
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:32,030
This is for the good of all of us.

500
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,660
Shouldn't have done that! Now you're gonna get it!

501
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,940
Tie her legs.

502
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,540
You like their kind so much? Now you can be just like them.

503
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:53,440
Ow, damn it! She won't stop kicking.
I'll make her stop kicking.

504
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:03,780
Come on, Elly, you gotta breathe sometime.

505
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:05,950
Breathe.

506
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:18,990
Stubborn little bitch.
Not for much longer. Breathe or drown, Elly!

507
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,080
She's breathing.

508
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:29,720
- That's a good girl, Elly. - Cut her quick!

509
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,530
Damn it! We're gonna have to hold her under again.

510
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,670
- Push her in. - Oh.

511
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,020
Police!

512
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,390
No, no, you don't!

513
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,770
You're staying right here.

514
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:27,610
Nick!

515
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:37,880
Nick!

516
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,540
Nick!

517
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:48,660
Here.

518
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:04,850
You all right?

519
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,380
I think so.

520
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,100
Are you okay?

521
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:17,530
I got Dominic and Jesse handcuffed.
How do you want to deal with them?

522
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,740
Lock 'em up.
They won't last long.

523
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:24,670
They should've thought about that before.
You know how long you were under that water?

524
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:27,940
Thought you were dead.
You sure look like it.

525
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,130
- Oh, my God! Elly? - Elly!

526
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:33,980
- Elly! - Elly!

527
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:37,750
- Oh, thank God she's okay. - Oh, baby, come here.

528
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:39,850
You're okay.

529
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,070
I'm so sorry.

530
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,390
Oh, my girls.

531
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:52,050
"I can't find anything medically wrong with you,

532
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:55,780
"except you appear to have a metabolic rate "half a normal person's.

533
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:59,060
"I can't explain this, but it doesn't seem "to be interfering with your life.

534
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:02,790
You seem healthy, with tremendous physical endurance."

535
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:06,720
"Bheadr."

536
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,140
"Haven't been able to spend the money.

537
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:13,500
"Royal assassination causing much turmoil.

538
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:17,910
"No longer safe. Must leave now.

539
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,000
Love you, M."

540
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,210
"Love you, M"?

541
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,450
Who the hell is M, Nick?

542
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:38,360
Europe and the world have gathered today in Vienna, Austria,

543
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,370
to mourn the passing of crown prince Eric Renard,

544
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:44,660
second in line to the Cronenberg throne and empire.

545
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:47,880
British media report allegations by an unnamed source

546
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:52,750
that an underground movement may have been responsible for the crown prince's assassination.

547
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:58,010
Austrian police are working with French and British intelligence to find those responsible.

548
00:40:58,010 --> 00:41:00,480
The question on everyone's mind is

549
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,060
who will be given the reins of this royal family?

550
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:07,570
Number three.

551
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:10,880
- You sure? - Yeah.

552
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:27,010
Look, can I... can I ask you guys something?

553
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,200
Sure.

554
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,420
I-I'm not so sure how to say this, but...

555
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:38,780
You know that girl that pulled me out of the water, Elly?
What about her?

556
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:40,680
Well, I don't know, but 

557
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:45,330
I saw something really strange.

558
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:47,430
- Like what? - Like, I...

559
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:52,550
Think she's, like, a mutant or something, some kind of,

560
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:55,200
like, mermaid thing... I...

561
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:58,520
Okay, I know how that sounds, believe me.

562
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:02,370
I just... She came over when

563
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,720
and she just wasn't...

564
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:08,610
Normal.

565
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:10,520
Nobody is, Jake.

566
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:12,300
It's Portland.

567
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:24,560
