4
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
这是哪里?
Where are we?

5
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,630
飞机上
The plane.

6
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:59,160
什么飞机?
What?

7
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,700
Udinov家族的慷慨赠送
Courtesy of the Udinov family trust.

8
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,960
我们可以把这里当成指挥部
We've been using it as our command center.

9
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:14,130
你怎么...
How did you...

10
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,360
你没来约定的地方
When you didn't show at the rendezvous point,

11
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,160
我就回头找你 在车祸现场发现了你的踪迹
I backtracked and picked up your trail from the crash.

12
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,930
子弹直接穿了过去 但是你失血过多
It's through and through, but you lost a lot of blood.

13
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:27,730
可能会有点晕
You're gonna feel faint.

14
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:30,530
为了处理伤口 我把你的衣服剪掉了
I had to cut your shirt off to get to the wound.

15
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:31,700
要是她醒了 我...
If she's awake, I need to...

16
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,060
不 让她休息一下
No, let's let her rest.

17
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,500
- Nikki  - 呆子
- Nikki.  - Nerd.

18
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,660
嘿
Hey.

19
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,800
我真怕再也见不到你了
Wasn't sure we'd see you alive again.

20
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,960
还好你没事
Glad we did.

21
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,000
这里还有别人吗?
Who else is here?

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,430
没有了 就我们
Right now, this is it.

23
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,930
- 谁开的飞机?  - 自动驾驶
- Who's flying the plane?  - Autopilot.

24
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,000
我们现在正要去华盛顿
Right now, we're halfway to D.C.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,200
为什么?
Why?

26
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,000
你应该看看这个
There's something you should see.

27
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,660
现已确定 正是刺杀了总统的刺客
At this point, I can confirm that presidential assassin

28
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:18,800
Nikita Mears策划了这场爆炸
Nikita Mears was the individual who planted the explosive device

29
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,200
导致ENN记者Dale Gordon的死亡
resulting in the death of ENN journalist Dale Gordon.

30
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,700
同时 我们已经确定了
We also believe that we have uncovered

31
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,930
她的动机
the motive for the killing.

32
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:30,500
根据他的调查笔记
According to his notes, Mr. Gordon was set

33
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,100
Gordon先生正在调查一个海外账户
to report on evidence of an offshore cayman account

34
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,900
据国安局称 那个账户是Nikita Mears名下的
that, according to NSA, was in Nikita Mears's name.

35
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,560
一派胡言
That's a lie.

36
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,660
一定是Graham杀了Dale之后
Graham must have planted that evidence on Dale

37
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,960
又把笔记本放在他身上
right after he killed him.

38
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,600
是我让Dale直接去找联邦调查局局长的
I told Dale to go straight to the head of the FBI.

39
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,300
- 是我害了他  - 不
- I'm the reason he's dead.  - No.

40
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,700
Amanda才是凶手
He's dead because of Amanda.

41
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,960
她控制着Graham
She's the one controlling Graham.

42
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,460
但她怎么做到的?
Yeah, but how? How is she doing this?

43
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,930
- 她怎么做到这一切的?  - 我想我知道了
- How is she doing any of this?  - I think I know.

44
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,730
联邦调查局的副局长
The Deputy Director of the FBI,

45
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,660
德国情报局官员 机密行动指挥官
a German BND officer, a secret service supervisor,

46
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,700
还有美国总统
and the President of the United States.

47
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,860
他们都是高层领导人
All high level.

48
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,030
不可能被收买
All seemingly incorruptible,

49
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,700
但却都叛国了 为什么?
yet all clearly compromised. how?

50
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,430
Amanda可以给他们下药
Well, if Amanda drugged them,

51
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,160
然后让他们坐上手术椅
she could have gotten them in her chair,

52
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,660
给他们的脑袋来一针?
stuck her needle in their heads?

53
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,760
Amanda的手术需要几个小时
Amanda's needling takes several hours,

54
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,060
最少也得半天
half a day at least.

55
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,060
如果这些人消失这么长时间
Any of these people disappear for that long,

56
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,230
一定会有人察觉的
they would have been noticed.

57
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,500
那她是怎么给他们洗脑的?
So how did she brainwash them?

58
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,460
不是洗脑 是掉包
She didn't. she switched them.

59
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,530
掉包?
Switched?

60
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,630
复制品
A double.

61
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:40,430
完美的替代
A perfect replica.

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,130
他们在身体上和精神上
Someone who's been physically

63
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:47,430
都与被复制者完全一样
and mentally altered to act as a replacement.

64
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,960
哦... Ryan
Uh... look, Ryan, I know

65
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,830
我知道你是个阴谋论者
you're the conspiracy guy and everything,

66
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:56,160
- 但这也太...  - 让人难以置信?
- but all this sounds a little...  - Hard to believe?

67
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,330
如果不知道已经有这种技术了
It would be, if we didn't know

68
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:59,530
确实可能不会相信
the Shop already had the tech for it.

69
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,530
高分子聚合物可以复制出人脸
Polymers that can make copies of someone's face,

70
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:05,430
DNA可以分化出身体各器官
body parts regenerated from source DNA,

71
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:08,930
再加上Amanda的一点技术
and now, Amanda is working with them.

72
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:12,030
她可以向人脑里移植芯片
She can install psychic circuit breakers into a person's head,

73
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,030
让他们忠心耿耿
make subjects suggestible and loyal.

74
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,900
她就是这样让Sam变成了Owen
The way she turned Sam into Owen.

75
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,130
这些加在一块
Put it all together, and you got a system

76
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,160
她就有了完美的卧底计划
to create the perfect undercover operative.

77
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,900
他们和真身一模一样
They look and act exactly like the real thing,

78
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,660
就连最亲近的人也看不出来
enough to fool even the people closest to them.

79
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,430
把他们安插进去
Place in the right positions, these operatives

80
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:35,430
商会就能掌控无上权力
would give the Shop incredible access and power.

81
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:41,130
在Alex发现商会运送的四个巴基斯坦人
It came together for me after Alex intercepted

82
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:44,260
完全一样的时候... 我就明白了
the Shop's latest shipment... four Pakistani men,

83
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:47,730
他们长得一模一样
All the same physical type.

84
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:51,060
他们要找的不是普通奴隶
They're not looking for random slaves.

85
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,160
而是能够塑造成别人的
They're looking for a specific type of clay

86
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,360
复制品原料
to mold into a preexisting form.

87
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,560
她怎么发现的?
How did she find that out?

88
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,700
她在追踪人贩子
She's been chasing human traffickers,

89
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,200
特别是和商会有关系的那些
ones with connection to the Shop.

90
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,160
- 她单独行动的?  - 还有Sonya
- By herself?  - Sonya's with her.

91
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,200
她可是Alex
Anyway, it's Alex.

92
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,460
她知道怎么照顾自己的
She knows how to take care of herself.

93
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,200
你不是在海边度假吗?
Shouldn't you be on a beach somewhere,

94
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,260
像其他退休清理人一样晒着太阳
doing whatever retired cleaners do?

95
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,830
那多没劲 事实证明 那会让我长雀斑
It got boring. Turns out, I freckle.

96
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,930
{\an8}印度 孟买

97
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,660
你偷了那么多钱
And you couldn't think of anything else to do

98
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,600
就不能干点别的吗?
with your stolen money?

99
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,100
偷? 那是我应得的
Stolen? I earned that money.

100
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,530
是Amanda对我洗脑
That's payback for ten whole years

101
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:28,000
整整十年的补偿
Amanda's brain rape stole from me.

102
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,730
三亿的补偿可真够多的
300 million is pretty good payback.

103
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,800
这只是个开始
It's a start.

104
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,560
你觉得无聊...
So you just got bored...

105
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,760
就来到孟买
decided to come to Mumbai

106
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,160
追捕人贩子了?
and hunt human traffickers?

107
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,830
不 我来到孟买
No. I decided to come to Mumbai

108
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:45,130
来抓那个想要抓人贩子的俄罗斯富二代
to hunt Russian heiresses who hunt human traffickers.

109
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,660
为什么?
Why?

110
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,760
因为有了你 我才能找到Amanda
'Cause you're my best shot at finding Amanda.

111
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,800
她把我像傻瓜一样耍
She made me look like a fool,

112
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,000
先是把我变成Owen
first by turning me into Owen,

113
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,760
然后在多伦多的G20峰会上让我出丑
then by playing me at the G20 back in Toronto.

114
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,560
我知道你们也在找她
I knew you guys would be looking for her too,

115
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,860
所以一直跟着你们
so I've been following you.

116
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,060
我看到你从他手下那里
I saw you take that scanner

117
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,360
拿到了一个扫描仪
off one of her operatives.

118
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,660
这是我在几个月里的第一条确凿线索
First solid lead I've seen in months,

119
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,660
你得把它给我
and you're gonna give it to me.

120
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,830
里面的数据
The data on this

121
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,260
能让我们找到陷害Nikita的人
could lead us to the people who framed Nikita.

122
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,130
- 它对我们很重要  - 你别无选择
- We need this.  - I'm not asking.

123
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,260
快走! 快走!
Go, go, go, go, go!

124
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:30,460
是人贩子 他们在找同伙
More traffickers, looking for their pals.

125
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,430
给我把枪!
Give me a gun!

126
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,460
Owen 快点!
Owen!

127
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,960
等等

128
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,260
他们逃不掉的

129
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,730
我本来是打算离开的
I was on my way out of here.

130
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,630
那辆车被遗弃在西面
The car was abandoned on the west side.

131
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,330
我们封锁了附近五十个街区
We've got a 50-block cordon around the area.

132
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:09,700
没用的 她已经逃走了
It won't matter. she's gone.

133
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,960
她受伤了 需要医治
She's wounded. she'll need medical attention.

134
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,160
她干了这么一票
After what she just pulled,

135
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,760
肯定很久不会再冒险
she won't stick her head up for anything,

136
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,200
她会低调行事
not for a very long time. 

137
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,400
先生 你的电话 Nikita打来的
Sir, you've got a call. it's Nikita.

138
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,100
先生 这个电话
Sir, call's right here.

139
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,500
嘿! 小点声!
Hey! Keep it down!

140
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,830
接通她
Put her on.

141
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,830
我是Graham
This is Graham.

142
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:29,960
你把我耍了
You know, you really had me fooled,

143
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,600
你说你只要真相
saying you were looking for the truth.

144
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,960
我没想到你自己就是个骗局
I didn't realize you were hiding it about yourself.

145
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,330
你受伤了 赶紧自首
You're injured. turn yourself in.

146
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,060
我保证你会得到治疗的
I promise, you'll be taken care of.

147
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,930
就像你给Dale Gordon的治疗一样?
Oh, you mean the way you took care of Dale Gordon?

148
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,660
别伤及无辜
No one else has to get hurt.

149
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,260
我要揭露你的真实身份
I'm going to expose you for who you really are.

150
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,460
我不知道你有什么目的
I don't know what you hope to accomplish.

151
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,260
大家听好了 这个自称Graham副局长的人
To everyone listening in, the man claiming

152
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,560
是个冒牌货
to be Deputy Director Graham is an impostor.

153
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,730
你们肯定也发现了
I'm sure many of you have noticed

154
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:52,830
他最近有点不对劲
that he's been a little off.

155
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,730
有点行为异常
Lapses in routine.

156
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:56,130
你们都知道
Have any of you asked him

157
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:59,000
最近他给谁打私人电话了吗?
who he's been talking to on his private phone?

158
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,960
你听好了 我会找到你的
Listen to me. I am gonna find you.

159
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,330
你觉得你还能躲多久?
How long do you think you can keep running?

160
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:05,060
不 不 你没听明白我的话
No, no, no, I don't think you're hearing me.

161
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,130
我已经躲了三个月
I've been on the run for three months,

162
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,460
躲着你 躲着大家
from you, from my life.

163
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,630
我放弃了一切
I have given up everything

164
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,800
甚至不敢说真话 但现在不会了
for even a shred of the truth, and now I have it.

165
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,430
我不会再躲躲藏藏了
So I'm not chasing shadows anymore.

166
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:19,330
我已经知道怎么反击了
I have a point of attack.

167
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:21,200
你就是目标
You.

168
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:25,200
尼基塔 第四季第2集

169
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,150
有四个人
I count four.

170
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:37,650
- 在两个位置  - 他们在等我们出去
- Two cover positions.  - They're waiting us out.

171
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,810
也许在等待支援
Probably expecting reinforcements.

172
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:43,710
我们应该在支援到达之前出去
We should get out of here before they arrive.

173
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:46,150
我们得想办法到货车上
We need to make it to that van.

174
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:50,680
他们抢占了很好的位置 这是找死
With the cover they have? That'd be suicide.

175
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,750
Sonya 能听到吗?
Sonya, are you there?

176
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,950
Alex! 你怎么还没回来?
Alex! Why aren't you on your way back?

177
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,910
我被困住了
Got held up.

178
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,450
- 我们需要帮忙  - "你们"?
- We need your help.  - "We"?

179
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:05,080
- 我和Owen  - Owen?
- Me and Owen.  - Owen?

180
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,480
- 就是Sam  - 他怎么...
- I mean, Sam.  - What's he...

181
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,750
以后再说 我们被Priya的手下
Later. look, we got pinned down

182
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,910
困住了
by Priya's men.

183
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:12,580
我们需要掩护来突出重围
We need some sort of distraction to get past them.

184
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,810
我可以入侵电网
I think I can hack the power grid

185
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:24,010
关掉路灯
and shut down the lights.

186
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:27,110
- 这样足够了吗?  - 够了
- Will that give you enough cover?  - I think so.

187
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:29,080
我们得打掉车头灯
We need to take out the headlights.

188
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,880
好的 你负责左面
All right. you take the left,

189
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,880
我负责右面
I got the right.

190
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,250
我知道你想报仇
Look, I get it. you want vengeance.

191
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,650
Amanda那样对你
After what Amanda did to you,

192
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:40,980
我也会感同身受 所以我知道你的目的
I would feel the same way, so I get what you're doing.

193
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,710
但不代表我信任你
But that doesn't mean I trust you.

194
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:45,750
没关系 我也不信任你
That's okay. I don't trust you either.

195
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:50,780
我们在这点上是一致的
So we've got that in common.

196
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:53,410
Sonya 动手吧
Sonya, do it.

197
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:09,610
Alex啊!
Alex!

198
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:26,080
你对我开枪!
You shot me!

199
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,110
射在防弹衣上了
In the kevlar.

200
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:30,080
我把你推出了他的发射范围
I knocked you out of his line of fire.

201
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,450
你怎么知道我穿了防弹衣?
How did you know I had it on?

202
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:34,750
标准行动装备
Standard mission protocol.

203
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,150
你是那种严守规定的人
And you're the kind to keep to protocol.

204
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:40,710
也就是说你是瞎猜的
Meaning you guessed.

205
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,980
下次给我点提醒
Next time, give me a heads-up.

206
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,510
我叫"Alex"了
I said "Alex".

207
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:51,980
不 我... 我觉得没人会相信她
No, I... I don't think anyone believes her.

208
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,780
她也没指望
She didn't expect them to.

209
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,250
她打给你只是为了通知我
She called you to let me know

210
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,980
她重回游戏了
she's back in the game.

211
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,250
那我要进行阿尔法应急计划吗?
Do I proceed with alpha contingency?

212
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,180
不用了 她只是想逼你做出反应 
No, she's trying to get you to react,

213
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,150
走进陷阱而已
force you into a false move.

214
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,080
你叫Matthew Graham
Your name is Matthew Graham.

215
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,080
你是联邦调查局的副局长
You're the Deputy Director of the FBI.

216
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,910
你要对政府 对国家 以及对我
You have a duty to your office and to your country

217
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,910
负责
and to me.

218
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:16,880
我们在执行重大的使命
This is important work we're doing.

219
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,110
Nikita活在聚光灯下好久了
Nikita's been living under the glare of the spotlight.

220
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,810
现在她觉得也许有办法
Now she thinks there may be a way

221
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:27,180
把这当成优势
to use it to her advantage.

222
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,650
好吧 我会保证继续让她成为焦点
Well, I'm going to make sure it stays on her.

223
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:35,010
终有一天把她烧焦
I'm going to make sure it sears her.

224
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:36,080
Amanda到底要利用
What's Amanda trying to do

225
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,550
这个秘密账户的谎做什么?
with this lie about the secret account?

226
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:40,050
铺设背景
Establish a context.

227
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:43,480
为Spencer的暗杀编故事
Create a narrative for Spencer's assassination.

228
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,610
没错 但为什么?
Yeah, but why?

229
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:46,810
我们以为杀了总统
We thought killing the President

230
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:47,910
商会的游戏就结束了
was the endgame for the Shop,

231
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,950
但可能那只是开始
but maybe it's just the beginning.

232
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:53,410
这不像Amanda的风格
This doesn't feel like Amanda.

233
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:57,210
太阴险了
It's too subtle.

234
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,150
另有其人
This is someone else.

235
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,450
他知道怎么在财政部门
Someone who knows how to maneuver

236
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:01,710
游刃自如
in the financial sector.

237
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:04,050
他以前掌握权势
Someone who's used to power

238
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:08,310
但也安于待在阴暗处
but comfortable staying in the shadows.

239
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,850
Nikita那边的电话
And no other voices could be heard

240
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,010
没听到其他声音吗?
on Nikita's side of the call?

241
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:13,680
没有 长官 声音取证也没结果
No, sir, audio forensics were inconclusive.

242
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,150
我以为联邦调查局有追踪信号
I'm assuming the FBI tried to trace the signal.

243
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:18,110
他们追踪了 但是没追到
They did, but without any success.

244
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:21,210
他们是怎么发现复制的?
How did they discover the double?

245
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:22,850
我们没留下蛛丝马迹
We left no loose ends.

246
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:25,580
事实证明Nikita掌握着很多资源
Nikita has proven to be very resourceful.

247
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:28,910
不 这超出她的能力范围了
No. No, this is beyond her.

248
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:31,910
要解决这样的问题...
Figuring out something like this is...

249
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:34,250
需要更抽象的思维
It's a much more abstract level of thought.

250
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,350
非对称
Asymmetrical.

251
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:40,550
对模式识别的独特天赋
A unique talent for pattern recognition.

252
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:49,010
是Ryan Fletcher
Ryan Fletcher.

253
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,550
抱歉
Sorry.

254
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:57,380
噢 伤口真糟糕
Ugh, that's gnarly.

255
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,050
原本有可能更糟
Could have been a lot worse.

256
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:02,980
你够幸运的 Mikey及时找到了你
You're lucky Mikey got to you when he did.

257
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,310
幸运
Lucky.

258
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:09,850
Dale Gordon就没那么幸运 对吧?
Not so much for Dale Gordon, huh?

259
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:12,410
每个人都被Graham骗了 你也不知道
Graham had everybody fooled. You couldn't have known.

260
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:14,750
对 但我把Dale也卷进来了
Yeah, but I'm the one who got Dale involved.

261
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,780
我老是犯错
I'm always the one.

262
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,510
当时我已经很小心了
You know, when I was out there, nerd, I was so careful.

263
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:26,480
非常小心 我只是... 我一直低着头
So careful, I just... I kept my head down,

264
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,380
往前走
and I kept going.

265
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:31,780
我没有接触任何人 因为我知道一接触的话 
I didn't contact anyone, because I knew that if I did,

266
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,110
肯定有人受伤
that someone would get hurt.

267
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:36,150
所以我马上离开了
That's why I left in the first place.

268
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:39,750
如果我留下的话 下个受伤的人会是谁?
Who else is going to get hurt because of me if I stay?

269
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:47,310
他怎么样?
How is he?

270
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:52,050
他比我前段时间看到的更专注了
He's a lot more focused than I've seen him in a while.

271
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:59,110
我知道我的离开伤害了他
I know when I left, I hurt him.

272
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,310
也伤害了我自己
It hurt me too.

273
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,110
他有说什么吗?
Did he say anything?

274
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:09,380
- 我离开之后?  - 关于你的事?
- After I left?  - About you?

275
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:18,380
- 他什么都没说  - 一次都没有?
- He didn't say anything.  - Not once?

276
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,710
在我们面前没有
Not in front of us.

277
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,450
抱歉 亲爱的
Oh, sorry, darling.

278
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:40,850
我没时间做晚饭
I didn't have time to make dinner.

279
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:43,350
委员会延时了
The committee meeting ran late.

280
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,450
给你三次机会猜为什么
Three guesses why.

281
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:48,710
我保证 那些贵妇们很喜欢这样的星期五酒会
I swear, those ladies love their wine Fridays.

282
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:50,780
你要点意大利餐吗?
You want to order italian?

283
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:53,780
听着 我们得聊下
Listen, we need to talk.

284
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,180
怎么了? 一切还好吧?
What's the matter? Is everything okay?

285
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,910
当然好 我只是...
Yes, of course. I just...

286
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:01,110
我想谢谢你做的一切
I wanted to thank you for everything,

287
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:04,680
你对我的支持
How you've stood by me.

288
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,080
Mattew 发生什么事了?
Matthew, what's going on?

289
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,910
转右一点
Turn to your right a bit.

290
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:09,980
什么? 我不懂
What? I don't understand.

291
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,480
伙计们! 你们过来看看
Uh, guys! You need to see this.

292
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,180
如果您是刚刚调到本台 我们正在
If you're just joining us, we are live

293
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,750
联邦调查局副局长Matthew Graham家门外实况转播
outside the residence of FBI deputy director Matthew Graham,

294
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:51,010
今晚早些时候 Graham的妻子被暗杀了
where earlier tonight an attempt was made on Graham's life.

295
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:52,650
根据初步报告
According to preliminary reports,

296
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,410
枪弹射入其室内
shots were fired into the home,

297
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,910
Gramham受伤 妻子Sarah身亡
wounding Graham and killing his wife Sarah.

298
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,610
当局还在收集证据
Authorities are still piecing together the evidence,

299
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:01,510
但一位知情人士透露
but a source close to the investigation

300
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,550
联邦调查局确信
tells us that the FBI believes this to be

301
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:06,810
这是刺客Nikita Mears的所作所为
the work of assassin Nikita Mears.

302
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:08,110
我们需要回应
We wanted a response.

303
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,280
- 我们有回应了  - 不 这不对 
- We got a response.  - No, this is all wrong.

304
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,780
对于商会来说太高调了
This is too loud for the Shop.

305
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:12,850
对于Amanda就不高调了
But not for Amanda.

306
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,680
这太过分了 对于她来说也是
This is over the top, even for her.

307
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,210
我们把聚光灯射向Graham
We put the spotlight on Graham.

308
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:18,410
Amanda就推回给Nikita
Amanda shoved it back to Nikita.

309
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:21,380
她真强硬
She's really playing hardball.

310
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,410
那现在轮到我们强硬了
Then it's time we did the same.

311
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:25,980
如果Gramham是复制出来的 我们把他曝光
If Graham is a double, we expose him to the world.

312
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,910
我们没有实质证据
We have no physical proof.

313
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,510
联邦调查局有 他们必须有
The FBI, they have to have a sample

314
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,750
Gramham本人的基因取样 对吧?
of the real Graham's DNA, right?

315
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,810
对
Sure.

316
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:35,950
全体人员都被要求提供取样的
All personnel are required to provide one.

317
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:37,910
那我们就可以对比存档上的
Then we have them compare it to what's on file,

318
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,250
和骗子手上的基因取样
to the impostor's DNA.

319
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:42,010
我认为这个复制人不会和我们合作
I don't think the double is going to cooperate.

320
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:45,380
那我们就让他别无选择
So we don't give him a choice.

321
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:49,180
联邦调查局验尸时都要拿基因样本
The FBI has to take a DNA sample while they're doing an autopsy.

322
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,950
你想杀了联邦调查局的副局长?
You want to kill the Deputy Director of the FBI?

323
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:55,680
Amanda已经杀了
Amanda already did that.

324
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,580
她不是想让大家认为我就是杀手吗?
She wants the world to see me as an assassin?

325
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,910
那就随她意吧
Let's give her what she wants.

326
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:06,060
Gramham藏在他家里
Graham's holed up at his casa.

327
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,360
毫无疑问 安全系统也加倍了
Not surprisingly, the security detail has doubled,

328
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,400
那里媒体的人也很多
as has the media presence.

329
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,860
接近他家会非常困难
Getting close is gonna be insanely hard.

330
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:15,930
要接近而且不被发现 就更没可能了 
Getting close without being seen, forget about it.

331
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:17,860
我们现在资源有限
Standard kill protocols won't work,

332
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,060
标准的刺杀计划肯定没用
not with our limited resources.

333
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,600
我们来玩声东击西吧
We're gonna have to run a bluff.

334
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,000
逼他出来 或者至少
Get him out of there, or at least,

335
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,100
让他想离开那
get him to want to come out of there.

336
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,660
这需要双人操作才行得通
This only works as a two-man op.

337
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:34,230
我们这样可以吗?
Are we okay with that?

338
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,760
可以 绝对可以
Yeah, absolutely.

339
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,060
谢谢你的帮助
Well, thanks for your help.

340
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,700
如果你认为我会留下
If you think I'm leaving here

341
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,360
扫描器就走 那你错了
without that scanner, you're wrong.

342
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,500
你带不走扫描器的 
Not gonna happen.

343
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,830
不打就带不走?
Without a fight?

344
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:09,530
听着 我们连里面是什么都不知道 对吧?
Look, we don't even know what's on that thing, right?

345
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:12,830
我提议先打开看看 再决定
I say we crack it first, decide then.

346
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,600
我们有新发现后会通知你的
I'll contact you when we find something.

347
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,530
我不会让你或者扫描器离开我的视线
Uh... uh, I'm not letting you or it out of my sight.

348
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:29,230
另外 你一直和
Besides, you keep mixing it up

349
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:31,900
仓库那些小伙子们混在一起
with boys like that at the warehouse,

350
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,200
- 你迟早会需要我的  - 需要你?
- you are gonna need me.  - Need you?

351
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,160
就像暴动时组织需要你那样?
The way we needed you at division during the mutiny?

352
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,660
别说需要了 你拿枪指着
Instead of backing us up, you put a gun

353
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:44,030
Birkhoff的头 还想开枪射Michael
to Birkhoff's head, and you tried to shoot Michael.

354
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:47,500
容我澄清下 是Michael先动手的
In my defense, it was Michael.

355
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:52,000
好 听着 
Okay, look, look.

356
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,660
我一直在回想你说过的话 
I've been thinking about what you said.

357
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,400
在多伦多的时候
Back in Toronto?

358
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,800
别做傻事
Don't do this.

359
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,300
你作为Owen的那段生活肯定有意义
Your time as Owen has to mean something.

360
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,100
对 意味着我失去了10年的生命
Yeah, it means I lost ten years of my life.

361
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,600
并不只有损失
It wasn't just a loss.

362
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,300
你也有收获 我们这些朋友
You gained as well. All of us.

363
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:20,230
我们都在乎你
We care about you.

364
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:24,060
我... 我确实射了黑盒
I... I did shoot the Black Box.

365
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:28,400
我不是你的敌人
I'm not your enemy.

366
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,630
也许我们可以互相帮助
Maybe we could help each other out.

367
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:39,760
你可以待到Sonya破解了那个扫描器
You can stick around until Sonya decrypts the scanner.

368
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,400
之后的事情我可不能保证
After that, no promises.

369
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,660
像Nikita Mears这样的刺客以为消灭了证人
Thugs like Nikita Mears think that by killing the messenger,

370
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,430
就消灭了证据
they kill the message.

371
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:09,300
相反 这只会让真相更快水落石出
Instead, it just makes the truth even louder.

372
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,000
我现在可以确认Nikita Mears
I can now confirm that the secret Cayman account

373
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,030
在也门的秘密账户
in Nikita Mears's name was,

374
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,330
其实是巴基斯坦情报局设立的
in fact, funded by Pakistani intelligence.

375
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:19,760
追查这条线索
Now, tracing this connection

376
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,060
并不容易 因为这些资金
has not been easy because the money

377
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,900
是通过一个关键的第三方势力小心转移的
was carefully laundered through a key third party,

378
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,860
此时此刻我们正在追查这个第三方势力
a party that we are closing in on as we speak.

379
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,160
他们想把事态做的像Nikita
They want it to look like Nikita

380
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,930
在为巴基斯坦工作一样
is working for the Pakistanis.

381
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:41,900
- 为什么?  - 如果他们能够
- Why?  - If they can prove

382
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,560
证实巴政府是
the Pakistani government was

383
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,200
刺杀总统的幕后主使
behind the President's assassination,

384
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,460
美国就可以名正言顺的入侵
then the U.S. would have grounds to invade.

385
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,930
证实? 我们可是美国
Prove? This is America.

386
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:52,160
只需要有个暗示 模糊的暗示就够了
All they have to do is hint, vaguely insinuate.

387
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,430
哦 那么他们是在计划暗示出一次世界大战
Well, then they're planning to hint their way into a world war.

388
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:58,360
巴基斯坦是核势力国家
Pakistan is a nuclear power.

389
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,600
哦 商会他妈为什么要这样?
Well, why the hell would the Shop want that?

390
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,430
我们只知道
All we know is,

391
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:06,260
这事情不仅仅是陷害Nikita那么简单
this was always bigger than framing Nikita.

392
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,530
现在我们知道有多严重了
Now we know how much bigger.

393
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,530
那个呢?
What's up with that?

394
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:16,860
鱼还没有上钩
The shoe yet to drop.

395
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:20,560
这是Graham第二次使用国安局的情报了
This is the second time Graham has referenced NSA intel.

396
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,400
什么 你觉得他在里边也有内鬼吗?
What, you think he's got a double-in-arms over there?

397
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,930
有可能
Could be.

398
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:27,260
你能不能黑进联邦调查局的通信记录?
Can you hack into the FBI's communication logs?

399
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,960
查查Graham跟国安局的什么人联系过
Find who Graham has been communicating with at the NSA.

400
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,960
会有不少人的
Gonna be a big list.

401
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,630
你只要使用我们早些的搜索规则
Not if you filter the results

402
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:33,860
过滤一下就不会太多了
using our earlier search criteria.

403
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,400
只盯着高层的人物就好
Just stick to the higher-level names.

404
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,160
他们想让大众认为Nikita是恐怖分子
They want people to think Nikita is a terrorist.

405
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,930
哦 这样的话 她接下来的行动就像回事了
Well, in that case, they're gonna love what she does next.

406
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,630
我到位了 很快准备好
I'm in position. Be ready soon.

407
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:56,430
收到 我在停车场
Copy that. I'm in the lot.

408
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:58,800
你确定是这辆车?
Are you sure the right car is here?

409
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,800
确定
Yep.

410
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,260
五层 黑色SUV
Black SUV, level five.

411
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:04,930
用雷明顿700(枪支型号)是吗?
Using the Remington 700?

412
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:06,800
不是 是PSG1型
No, the PSG-1.

413
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,260
稳定性够吗?
Gonna have enough stability with that?

414
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,260
可以 我能搞定
Yeah, I'll be fine.

415
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,330
可是 你很久没开过枪了
Well, you haven't shot in a while.

416
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:14,660
对 但有些事情是忘不掉的
Well, some things you don't forget.

417
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,200
希望如此
Let's hope not.

418
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:22,300
Michael 离开你我也悲痛欲绝
Michael, leaving you almost killed me.

419
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:25,360
不用解释了
Don't have to explain.

420
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,330
那是为了保护你 保护你们
It was to protect you. All of you.

421
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:29,400
你说得很明白了
Well, you made that clear.

422
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,830
如果我不得不再离开的话 我也会的
If I had to do it over again, I would.

423
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:33,200
因为你自己做的决定总是正确的
Because your call is always the right call.

424
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,900
- 这些都不是我的决定!  - 不允许别人
- None of this is my call!  - No one else is allowed

425
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,300
- 做决定  - 我不能置你们于险地
- to decide.  - Not if it puts you in danger.

426
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,700
这个被动的局面不是我有意要选择的
This whole impossible situation is not something I chose.

427
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,130
我就不该来这
I shouldn't even be here now.

428
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:50,050
我还是应该走
I should leave again.

429
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:53,250
不 你属于这里
No. you belong here.

430
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,280
我们合作会更好一些
We're all better working together.

431
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,810
我们一直是这样
We always have been.

432
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:01,710
所以你生气是因为我的离开会伤害到团队?
So you're upset I left because it hurt the team?

433
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:02,850
是的
That's right.

434
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:05,880
团队需要你 一直是如此
The team needs you. It always has.

435
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,450
我也需要你们大家
I needed all of you too.

436
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:18,550
我知道
I know.

437
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,910
欢迎回家
Welcome home.

438
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,400
数字化面具快完工了
Digital mask is almost done.

439
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,300
怎么样?
How's it look?

440
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,730
太他妈棒了 我不得不夸自己
Pretty damn good, if I say so myself.

441
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,760
空包弹直接命中
Squib placement was dead-on.

442
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,930
Nikki用假弹打得很逼真
Nikki hit him perfectly with the false round.

443
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:06,460
我一直在问自己是不是真的
I never cease to amaze myself.

444
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:16,200
快准备好传送信号了
Almost ready to transmit.

445
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,330
收到
Copy that.

446
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,260
我们会准备好的
We'll be ready.

447
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,500
用点38口径的子弹试试
Try .38s.

448
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,230
弹径更小 更合适
It's a smaller barrel. it'll fit better.

449
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,960
我觉得那打击力量不足
Don't think that's enough stopping power.

450
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,630
我们只有一枪的机会
We're only getting one shot at this.

451
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:29,830
那就用热装填的空尖弹
Then use hot-loaded hollow points.

452
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:32,900
热装填 是吧? 你在哪学的那个?
Hot loading, huh? Where'd you learn that?

453
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,030
德州
Texas.

454
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,630
Los Zetas组织的正常训练
It's common practice with Los Zetas.

455
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:39,900
我在那停留过几周
I spent a couple of weeks with them.

456
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:45,060
Los Zetas 那可是个强悍的帮会
Los Zetas. That's a rough gang.

457
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:48,000
没有Michigan Winters那么强悍
Not as rough as Michigan Winters.

458
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:52,130
也没有成为头号公敌这么强悍
Or seeing that you've become public enemy number one.

459
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:55,400
是啊 我觉得你在德州的时候我们发现过你
Yeah, I think we got a hit on you in Texas.

460
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,530
为了阻止边境巡逻队发现你的行踪
Birkhoff had a hell of a time keeping

461
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:00,800
Birkhoff可是花了一段时间的力气
the border patrol from picking up your trail.

462
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,930
很欣慰那个怪才替我打掩护
Well, I'm glad that nerd was watching out for me.

463
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:12,130
是啊 他是担心你
Yeah. he was worried about you.

464
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,400
必须要谢谢他了
I'll have to thank him.

465
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,600
- 电磁脉冲准备好了  - 发射干扰吧
- E.M.P. is ready.  - Fire the pulse.

466
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,100
嘿 我这没信号了
Hey, I just lost juice here.

467
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:50,500
没有 我什么都没干 我们还没开始转播
No, I didn't do anything. we weren't even transmitting.

468
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,830
行 好的 我去检查一下天线
Yeah, yeah, I'll go check the cable.

469
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:18,400
Michael 他回来了
Michael, he's coming back.

470
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,160
又有信号了
We're back.

471
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:39,600
有一个加密芯片 不过加密法则
It's got a cryptographic chip, but the encryption algorithm

472
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,900
- 是我没见过的  - 好极了
- is like nothing I've seen.  - Great.

473
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:45,630
我们只能破解源代码了
We're gonna have to unpack the source code.

474
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:48,360
- 需要多久?  - 哦 如果商会
- How long will that take?  - Well, assuming the Shop

475
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,960
没有用太多黑暗手段的话
didn't protect it with too much dark magic,

476
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,730
- 一两个小时就可以了  - 可以
- A couple hours.  - All right.

477
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:54,660
这段时间我可以盯住Sam
I can deal with Sam until then.

478
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:58,000
Sam 别忘了 他可是个演技派
Sam. Don't forget, he's a pod person.

479
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,330
外表看起来可能完全正常
May look all normal on the outside,

480
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:03,000
不过在内心深处 他很记仇
but deep down inside, he is Sith.

481
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,200
我会注意他的
I'm keeping an eye on him.

482
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,900
而且 他看起来更能自控了
Besides, he does seem more manageable,

483
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,700
更像Owen了一些
more Owen-like.

484
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,160
呦 行了 伙计
Yo, come on, man.

485
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:15,660
我还需要点时间
I need a little more time.

486
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:18,530
我跟你说了 我会还你钱的
I told you, I'm gonna pay you back.

487
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:20,760
你了解我
You know me.

488
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,100
我哪一次没有成功?
Have I ever not come through?

489
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,460
那次不算
That doesn't count.

490
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:31,260
别 嘿 不要! 别派人来!
No, hey, no! Don't send guys!

491
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,900
我现在就去拿钱
I'm getting the money now.

492
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,700
我是Graham
Graham.

493
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,900
打开新闻看看
Turn on the news.

494
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:44,830
如果那是副局长Graham
To be that of Deputy Director Graham.

495
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,000
显而易见 他在自己的车旁
You can see, he approaches his car,

496
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,060
而且我们已经证实车辆确实是
and we have confirmed that the make and model of the vehicle

497
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:53,060
跟Graham所驾驶的一模一样 然后...
is the same one Graham drives. And then...

498
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:56,130
现在 我再重复一遍
Now, I want to repeat this again.

499
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:59,600
这段视频来自匿名发布者
This video was provided to us by an anonymous tipster,

500
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,260
我们目前还不能证实
and we have been unable to confirm

501
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,730
这个人 就是 副局长Graham
this is, indeed, Deputy Director Graham.

502
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:05,100
我们联系了联邦调查局...
We've called the FBI...

503
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,300
你们为什么不封锁这个?
Why didn't you put an end to this?

504
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,630
它直接就播出来了
It just came through,

505
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:09,660
而且现在已经传到了所有的媒体和网络上
but it's already all over the media and the internet.

506
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,730
召开一个媒体见面会
Call a press conference.

507
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:11,860
我半个小时之内到办公室
I'll be at the office in half an hour.

508
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,660
等等 我们可以在这发布否定信息
Wait, we could issue a denial from here.

509
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,330
她是在将我们的军! 她想逼我
She's playing mind games! She's trying to get me

510
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:17,800
躲起来 让我不见天日
to back down, to keep me in a hole.

511
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,760
我要阻止这个 现在就要
I'm putting a stop to this, right now.

512
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,730
这可能正中了Nikita的下怀
That could be exactly what Nikita wants,

513
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:26,100
让你在事先未安排的情况下出来
to draw you out at an unscheduled time.

514
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:29,260
她可能会在途中袭击
She might attack during transit.

515
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,100
你说得对
You're right.

516
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:36,800
没必要冒险 我们可以办到 就在这里
No need to risk it. We can do this, right here.

517
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,300
现在 我再重复一次
Now, I want to repeat this again.

518
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,530
这段视频来自匿名发布者
This video was provided to us by an anonymous tipster.

519
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:43,230
- 你要干什么 Nikita?  - 我们还不能证实
- What are you doing, Nikita?  - We have been unable to confirm

520
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:46,330
这个人 就是 副局长Graham
This is, indeed, Deputy Director Graham.

521
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:47,730
我们联系了联邦调查局

522
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:49,600
不过被告知他现在不方便接受采访
But were told he's not available at this time.

523
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,900
带一个"B"级的客人来我这
I need one of our guests from level "B" brought up to me,

524
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,760
然后再安排打个电话
and then I need to place a call.

525
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:08,660
他们来了
There they go.

526
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:12,430
等等!
Wait!

527
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,730
我们连上了
We're online.

528
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,000
遥控枪状况如何?
Status on the remote gun? 

529
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,800
一切正常 我们可以射击了
Green light. we're ready to go.

530
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,230
Alex 有你一个电话
Alex, you've got a call.

531
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,460
是从前台打来的
It's coming from the front desk.

532
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,730
有人从酒店给你打电话
Someone's calling you at the hotel.

533
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:02,300
喂?
Hello?

534
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,330
引领公众的生活其中有一点好处就是
One good thing about leading such a public life

535
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:06,330
让你的追随者更容易
is it makes it much easier

536
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:08,860
找到和联系你
for your fans to find and contact you.

537
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,260
你也是追随者吗?
Is that what you are, Amanda?

538
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,400
- Amanda?  - 我当然是 Alex
- A fan?  - Oh, of course, Alex.

539
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,600
我非常喜欢看你
I've especially enjoyed watching

540
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,230
带领人们 讨伐对抗人口买卖
you lead this crusade against human trafficking.

541
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,560
你要怎么样?
What do you want?

542
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,660
- 注意礼貌 亲爱的  - 哦 抱歉
- Manners, dear.  - Oh, I'm sorry.

543
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:22,030
我更乐意面对面给你一个更温暖的问候
I'd be happy to give you a much warmer greeting in person.

544
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,700
只要告诉我在哪能找到你就行
Just tell me where I can find you.

545
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,900
那还要等等了
That'll have to wait.

546
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,600
现在 我需要跟Nikita讲话
For now, I need to speak with Nikita.

547
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,030
还蛮着急的
It's rather pressing,

548
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:31,600
所以我们不要浪费时间了 让Birkhoff给我们联线
so let's stop wasting time, and have Birkhoff connect us.

549
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:37,230
Seymour 有情况了
Seymour, we have a situation.

550
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,700
你好 副局长 你能告诉我们是怎么回事吗?
Excuse me, Deputy Director. can you tell us what's going on?

551
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,730
- 好了  - 锁定目标
- Here we go.  - Target acquired.

552
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:50,400
有一段视频 报出我被谋杀了
A video was released, reported to show my death.

553
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,630
这只是彻头彻尾的谎言而已...
This was nothing but an elaborate lie...

554
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:53,900
Nikki 有电话找你
Nikki, you've got a call in.

555
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,630
这是由刺杀总统的杀手Nikita Mears捏造出来的
Perpetrated by presidential assassin Nikita Mears.

556
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:56,900
什么?
What?

557
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:59,260
是Amanda
It's Amanda.

558
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:03,230
- 只是又一次企图...  - 你好 Nikita
- Just another attempt...  - Hello, Nikita.

559
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:05,360
我不知道你在哪里 不过我猜
I don't know where you are, but my guess is

560
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,830
你正要杀掉我们的一个重要棋子
you're poised to kill one of our important assets.

561
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,860
- 动摇...  - 猜得很准 Amanda
- Shake...  - Gold star, Amanda.

562
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:13,530
哦 在你动手之前 有件事情你应该知道
Well, before you do, there's something you should know.

563
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:15,660
在我们用替身替换目标任务时
When we swap out a target for a double,

564
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,200
我们会留着其本人
we hold on to the original subject

565
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,130
来给我们提供作战保障
to assist in operational support.

566
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:23,600
Matthew Graham本人就在我旁边
The real Matthew Graham is right here next to me.

567
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,460
如果我们的人死了 
If our asset dies, there's no reason

568
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:30,100
那他本人也就没用了
to keep the original alive.

569
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,730
你明白我的意思吧 Nikita?
Do you understand what I'm saying, Nikita?

570
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:36,430
扣动扳机 你也就等于杀了Matthew Graham本人
You pull that trigger, you'll be killing the real Matthew Graham.

571
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,230
这些欺骗 这些骗局
These tricks, these attempts at deception,

572
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:49,760
正是她个人越来越绝望走投无路的最好说明
are nothing more than signs of an increasingly desperate individual.

573
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,260
我活着...
And I am alive...

574
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,400
一旦发布会结束的话
Once this press conference is over,

575
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,130
我们就杀不了他了 如果真是这样的话
we lose our shot at him, and if that happens,

576
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:58,930
谁知道他还会怎么作恶?
who knows how much more damage he'll do?

577
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:02,530
没错 Nikita 不惜一切代价杀了Graham
Yes, Nikita. Stop Graham at all costs.

578
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:03,830
最多你也就是再背负
All it will require of you

579
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:05,890
一条无辜的人命
is the death of one more innocent.

580
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:07,090
反正已经杀了那么多人了
You have so much blood

581
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:09,290
多死一个又何妨?
on your hands already, what's one more life?

582
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:11,090
我怎么知道你是不是在吹嘘?
How do I know you're not bluffing?

583
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:12,790
你或许早已经杀了Graham本人
You could have killed the original graham a long time ago.

584
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:15,430
告诉她
Tell her.

585
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:18,290
我是... 我是Matthew Graham
This is... this is Matthew Graham.

586
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:21,190
- Birkhoff  - 正在查
- Birkhoff.  - On it.

587
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:23,260
你能告诉我你在哪里吗?
Can you tell me where you are?

588
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:27,190
我也不知道我在哪里
I have no idea where I am.

589
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:29,090
- 马上就好 Nikki  - 这群疯子已经
- Incoming, Nikki.  - These lunatics have been

590
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:30,660
把我困在这里好几个月了 你是谁?
holding me here for months. Who is this?

591
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,690
你现在认真听我说
I need you to listen to me carefully.

592
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:34,790
现在有另一个人冒充是Matthew Graham
There's another person posing as Matthew Graham.

593
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:36,090
他掌管的是联邦调查局的特种部队
He's running a task force for the FBI,

594
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:38,690
所以我要确认你本人的真实身份
so I need to confirm you are who you say you are.

595
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:42,090
告诉我你进局里之前的最后一个职位是什么吗?
Can you tell me what your last post was before the Bureau?

596
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:44,090
我是海军负责武器的军官
I was a weapons officer in the navy.

597
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:47,530
等等 难道这就是他们为何要抓我?
Wait a minute, are you telling me that that's why they took me?

598
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:48,690
那边到底发生什么事了?
What the hell is going on out there?

599
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:49,960
Sarah呢?
What about Sarah?

600
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:53,760
她一定会受不了这种事的
She'd never go along with something like this.

601
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:59,830
Sarah死了 Matthew
Matthew, Sarah's dead.

602
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:03,290
- 什么?  - 替身把她害了
- What?  - The double had her killed,

603
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:04,590
现在他们在把事情忘我身上推
and they're trying to pin it on me.

604
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:06,290
因为都是你的错
Because it was your fault.

605
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:08,530
如果你不把信息给联邦调查局
If you hadn't sent that message to the FBI,

606
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:10,830
她会依然活着 你还是没变啊
she'd still be alive, but as always,

607
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:11,930
做事从不三思而后行
you never gave a thought

608
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:14,060
永远不会顾忌你所造成的伤害 
to the collateral damage you might cause.

609
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:17,330
Graham的替身是找到商会的关键 Nikita
Nikita, Graham's double is a key link for the Shop.

610
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:19,530
是他编造了也门账户和巴基斯坦的关系
He established the Cayman and Pakistan connection,

611
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:22,030
要是我猜得没错 他给大家引的这条路
and if I'm right, the path he's leading everyone on could lead

612
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:24,590
会造成更多的伤亡 甚至引起战争
to many more casualties, possibly a war.

613
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:27,630
好吧 我们来谈下伤亡
Yes, let's talk casualties.

614
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,190
因为你 Dale Gordon死了
Because of you, Dale Gordon is dead.

615
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:32,030
因为你 Sarah Graham死了
Because of you, Sarah Graham is dead.

616
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:34,930
我们拭目以待
We'll see.

617
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,390
就回答这些问题吧 我还有...
That's all for questions. I just have...

618
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:39,660
Nikita 这是我们最后的机会了
Nikita, this is our last chance.

619
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:43,030
一份声明要宣读一下
One statement that I would like to read.

620
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:46,760
不管到底是谁在说话
Whoever you are out there,

621
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,890
快开枪杀了那个混蛋!
blow that bastard away!

622
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:49,290
不管怎样他们都会杀了我的
They're gonna kill me anyway,

623
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:51,830
要是这个贱人赢了的话 我死也不会瞑目的
and I'll be damned if I let this psycho bitch win,

624
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:54,060
快开枪! 开枪啊!
So do it! Do it!

625
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:58,090
Nikita 动手吧
Nikita.

626
00:33:58,090 --> 00:33:59,660
到底还要多少人因你而死?
How many more have to die because of you?

627
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,860
他会造成更多的伤亡的
He'll cause thousands of casualties.

628
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,290
- 快没时间了  - 有一点我们知道
- We're gonna lose him.  - One of the things we know

629
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:08,930
那就是她是一个冷酷无情的杀手
is that she is a callous and cold-hearted killer,

630
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:11,260
对人命不会有任何怜惜
with no regard for human life.

631
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:14,930
她坚信这种残忍代表力量
She believes that such cruelty is a sign of strength.

632
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:18,090
我跟大家保证 根本不是这样
I am here to tell you that it is precisely the opposite.

633
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,990
我们会找到她 严惩她
She will be found, and she will be punished.

634
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:50,690
祝贺你 Nikita
Congratulations, Nikita.

635
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:53,290
你终于除掉了一个
You've managed to eliminate an operative

636
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:55,890
早就该死了的特工
who had already outlived his usefulness.

637
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:58,760
你唯一赢得的
All you've succeeded in doing

638
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:02,690
无非就是再多背负一条无辜的人命
is you've spilled more innocent blood.

639
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:06,530
我希望她能找到你
I hope she finds you.

640
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:08,930
我也是
So do I.

641
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,460
必须得这么做
It had to be done.

642
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,360
Amanda是绝对不会让Graham活着离开的
Amanda never would have let Graham out of there alive.

643
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:35,300
是她杀了那些人 不是你
And she's the one who killed those people, not you.

644
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,700
她只是在跟你玩心理战
She was just playing more of her head games.

645
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,960
谢谢
Thank you.

646
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:47,230
我都忘了我是多么需要你们
I forgot how much I need you guys.

647
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,800
哦 嘿
Oh, hey.

648
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,300
还有人要跟你说话
Another voice to add to the chorus.

649
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,360
Nikita吗?
Nikita?

650
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,200
嘿 Alex
Hey, Alex.

651
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,330
听到你的声音真开心
It's good to hear your voice.

652
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:02,460
你怎么样啊?
How are you doing?

653
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:05,800
我会没事的
I'll get by.

654
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,860
你呢?
How are you?

655
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,660
我听说你去追踪一些人贩子了
I heard you took on some traffickers.

656
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:11,960
- 情况怎么样?  - 完全在我控制之中
- How'd it go?  - Nothing I couldn't handle.

657
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,100
我还得到了一位老朋友的帮助
And I had some help from an old friend.

658
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,830
老朋友?
Old friend?

659
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:17,130
Sam在这里
Sam's here.

660
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:19,160
说他想向Amanda报仇
Says he wants revenge on Amanda

661
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,800
说我们应该合作 一起找到她
and that we should work together to find her.

662
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,000
他帮助我逃离了危险
He helped me out of a jam,

663
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,960
但我依然不确定是否该相信他 
but I'm still not sure I can trust him.

664
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,630
Owen啊
Owen.

665
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:28,630
给他一次机会吧
Give him a chance.

666
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:30,900
我... 我依然觉得我所认识的他
I... I still think that the person I knew

667
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:35,360
并没有完全消失 
is somewhere inside there.

668
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,200
知道吗 Alex 我觉得我...
You know, Alex, I think I just...

669
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,760
我还是需要相信有些人
I need to believe that there are people

670
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:44,930
依然值得我们为之战斗 知道吗?
still worth fighting for, you know?

671
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:47,330
你知道Michael依然关心你的
You know Michael still cares about you.

672
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,730
我知道 我也这么希望
I know, I just hope he does too.

673
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,430
我得挂了 稍后再联系你
I gotta go. I'll check in soon.

674
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:58,800
嘿 万事小心
Hey, be careful.

675
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:02,530
趴下 都趴下! 快点!
Get down, get down! Do it now!

676
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:04,400
不许动! 趴下!
Don't move! Get down!

677
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,760
- 你们抓错人了!  - 我说了 趴下!
- You've got the wrong person!  - I said, get down!

678
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,760
啊!
Aah!

679
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,630
快点 快走!
Come on, move!

680
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:16,760
- 嘿 嘿 嘿!  - 我们得帮忙...
- Hey, hey, hey!  - We gotta help...

681
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,830
听我说 在这个小地方
Listen to me. we can't do anything

682
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:19,160
我们什么都做不了! 我们先出去
from inside a cell! Let's clear out,

683
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,330
随后再想办法 但是现在 我们得快点走!
and we can figure it out, but right now, we gotta go!

684
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:23,530
快走!
Go!

685
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,500
有关当局依然在调查
Authorities are still investigating

686
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,260
Graham的谋杀案件 
Graham's shocking murder.

687
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:32,130
其中他们正在分析的一个难题 就是一段录像
One piece of the puzzle they're analyzing is the video,

688
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:36,500
这段视频在袭击发生后不久 被人送到了新闻处
sent to news outlets shortly after the attack.

689
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:39,460
我很抱歉采取这种过激行动
I apologize for taking such a drastic action,

690
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,730
但我杀的这个人
but the man calling himself

691
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:43,160
并不是Matthew Graham本人
Matthew Graham was not who he said he was.

692
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:47,000
我非常确定 所以我们做个交易吧
I am so sure of that that I will make this offer.

693
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,530
对他的尸体进行DNA检测
Do a DNA test on his body

694
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:50,460
跟原有的DNA样本对比
and compare it to the samples already on file.

695
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:53,530
只要你们这么做 我就自首
Do that, and I will turn myself in.

696
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:54,900
我们就是想要避免
This is exactly the sort of undue attention

697
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,600
引起这种过度关注
we sought to avoid. 

698
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:00,100
DNA检测 验尸 突发事件等 我们都计划好了
DNA tests, autopsies, contingencies we've planned for.

699
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,660
我们要考虑的是说好的协议
Taking established protocols into account.

700
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:05,200
不是Nikita这个不稳定的变数
Not the volatile movements of Nikita.

701
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,030
不得不承认
I have to admit,

702
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:11,030
当她扣动扳机时 我的确是惊讶到了
I was a bit surprised she pulled the trigger.

703
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:14,760
或许她真的已经变了
Perhaps she really has changed.

704
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:28,460
嘿 Michael...
Michael...

705
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:32,630
谢谢你
thank you.

706
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:34,630
我知道这场战争中 肯定会有伤亡的
I know there are going to be casualties in this war,

707
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:36,660
但是今天
But today,

708
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:40,500
因为有了你 我不用自责自己是一个杀手
I didn't have to be a killer because of you.

709
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:48,260
知道吗 在外面我最不想看到的
You know, the hardest part about being out there

710
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:52,000
就是那些到处张贴的通缉我的海报 
was seeing myself on those wanted posters.

711
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,800
它不断的触动我最深处的恐惧
This constant reminder of my worst fear,

712
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,660
那就是我只是"组织"创造出来的
that all I am is what Division made me.

713
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:04,860
"组织"不再跟我们有任何关系
Division doesn't define any of us anymore.

714
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:07,130
我们战斗是因为我们想战斗
We fight because we want to

715
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:09,260
也因为我们会一直互相扶持
and because we're here for each other.

716
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,530
所以我们是一个团队
That's why we're a team.

717
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:13,730
Michael 拜托你 能不能不说团队吗?
Michael, can we stop talking about the team, please?

718
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:19,430
Nikita 我说团队是有原因的
Nikita, there's a reason why I'm talking about the team.

719
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:23,060
我依然在这里帮你
I'm still here to help you,

720
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,960
永远都会
and I always will.

721
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:29,300
我依然在跟Amanda和商会斗争
And I'm still here to fight Amanda and the Shop.

722
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:36,960
但不再是为了我们的将来
But I am done fighting for us.

723
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:51,430
不管联邦调查局的验尸情况如何
No matter how the FBI autopsy plays out,

724
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:55,900
这件事已经逼得我们必须要速战速决了
this has already forced us to accelerate our timeline.

725
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,200
揭露Alexandra Udinov作为第三方
Revealing Alexandra Udinov as the third party

726
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,000
给巴基斯坦提供资助 完成暗杀
who helped Pakistan finance the assassination

727
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,560
本不应该是现在就做的
was not supposed to have happened until later.

728
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:05,000
这真的重要吗?
Does it really matter?

729
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,530
Alex也没法否认她在资助Nikita的事实
It's not like Alex can deny she's funding Nikita.

730
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:11,460
随便看一下Udinov账户 就会知道她已经资助
A look at the Udinov accounts will show she's been financing

731
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:14,900
她们那个小团队几个月了
their little band for months.

732
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,330
她们怎么去跟事实争辩呢 是吧?
How are they going to fight the truth, hmm?

733
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,500
我们现在进行的项目
The projects we have under way

734
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,230
相互重叠 相互依赖
are overlapping and interdependent.

735
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:21,860
所以时机非常重要
That is why timing is so important.

736
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:24,500
Graham本来还有其他事情要做
Graham had more of a part to play.

737
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,860
那我们就调整
Then we'll adjust.

738
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:29,830
别忘了 我们手中还有一张王牌
Don't forget, we still have one more ace in the hole,

739
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:32,530
他的任务才刚刚开始
and his mission is just beginning.

740
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:54,930
国家安全局 副局长 Ronald Peller

741
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:57,930
目标可能性: 98.9%

742
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:00,330
嘿 Birkhoff
Hey, Birkhoff.

743
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:02,730
国家安全局的搜查怎么样了?
How's the NSA search going?

744
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:04,530
找到替身了吗?
You find any doppelgangers yet?

745
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:07,300
还没有 暗影网还在搜索
Not yet, shadowbot's still doing his thing.

746
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:10,760
可能还需要等等吧
I guess you're just gonna have to wait.

747
