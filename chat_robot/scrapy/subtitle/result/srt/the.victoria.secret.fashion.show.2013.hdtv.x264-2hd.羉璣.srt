準備登台
We are standing by.

116
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,880
我覺得我從小到大
LILY ALDRIDGE: I have been walking up and down

117
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,170
就一直在模擬天橋走秀
fake runways my whole life, I think.

118
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,460
我第一次知道時尚秀時
The first time I was introduced to a fashion show,

119
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,150
我好像才四歲
I was, like, four years old.

120
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,710
我的夢想
LINDSAY ELLINGSON: My dream was to walk in

121
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,700
就是參加維密時尚內衣秀
the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show.

122
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:46,140
對於來自巴西小鎮的我來說
ADRIANA LIMA: Coming from a small town in Brazil,

123
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,130
這太了不起了
it's huge.

124
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,290
我就想成為那些女孩中的一員
ALESSANDRA AMBROSIO: I just wanted to be one of those girls,

125
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:53,720
加入這個不可思議的大家庭
you know, and wanted to be part of this incredible family.

126
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,600
我18歲時
When I turned 18,

127
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,610
我就定下目標
I had set a goal of being

128
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:00,000
要參加維密時尚內衣秀
in the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show

129
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,170
卻不知道這意味著什麼
and had no comprehension of what was ahead.

130
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:07,070
我當時年紀小  缺乏安全感  很害怕
DOUTZEN KROES: I was young and insecure and very scared.

131
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,220
我來維密的第一件事
CANDICE SWANEPOEL: The first thing I did

132
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,340
就是參加時尚內衣秀的模特選拔
with Victoria's Secret was the fashion show casting.

133
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,050
很多人問我們
Hi. MONICA MITRO: A lot of people ask us,

134
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:15,250
你們選拔都看重什麼
"What do you look for when you're cas?"Ting

135
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,130
對我們來說  最重要的是找到
For us, it's very, very important to have someone

136
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:20,390
熱情向上  積極開朗的人
who's enthusiastic and always positive and always happy--

137
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,870
我們要找一位美麗健康的女性
this gorgeous, healthy woman.

138
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:25,660
我從沒這麼緊張過
I had never been more nervous in my entire life.

139
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:29,900
把果凍和水泥混起來的感覺
If you could mix Jell-O and a cement block together...

140
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,310
-就是當時我腿的感覺  -慢點  慢點
that is how my legs felt. Slow down, slow down.

141
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,880
這是個成為巨星的好機會
This is a real opportunity

142
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,520
這是個成為巨星的好機會
to become a big star.

143
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,310
我當時很年輕  對我來說簡直不可思議
I was so young-- it was just mind-blowing for me

144
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:42,150
我能夠參加走秀  能夠站上天橋
that I'd booked the show and that I was there.

145
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:45,740
我見到了Heidi  Laetitia  Stephanie

00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,770
最溫柔  最美麗的姑娘
most gentle, beautiful thing I've ever seen.

443
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,360
我從沒在天橋上摔倒過
I've never fallen on the runway.

444
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,840
但世事無常  一旦發生後果極其沉重
But it's, you know, it happens, and it's awful when it does.

445
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:23,850
參加這個秀是每個女孩的夢想
To be in this show is a dream for every girl.

446
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,310
我十分重視它
It's a big deal.

447
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:30,280
去年在綵排的時候
Last year, I got there to do the rehearsal.

448
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,910
不知道怎麼回事
Then, I don't know how it happened.

449
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,830
我突然摔倒了
I just fell down.

450
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,250
我覺得我的腳踝斷了
I thought I broke my ankle.

451
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,440
恐懼感會一直縈繞在你腦海中
It's always in the back of your mind.

452
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,910
這件事真的特別可怕
It's a scary thing.

453
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:43,240
在綵排中扭傷腳踝
At the rehearsal,

454
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:46,030
然後無法參加走秀
hurt your foot, and you can't do the show?

455
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:49,030
這事太讓人傷心了
It was a very sad moment.

456
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:50,910
好了
Okay.

457
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,440
大家都嚇壞了
Everybody was freaking out

458
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,910
因為他們說
because they said it looked like

459
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:55,840
看上去很嚴重
her foot literally broke,

460
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,860
她的腳踝好像真的斷了
snapped from underneath her.

461
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,060
我當然特別沮喪
Of course, I was very upset.

462
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,780
我開始哭泣
You know, I start to cry.

463
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,560
當時的場面特別沉重
It was pretty heavy.

464
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,190
第二天  我醒來
And the next day, I woke up,

465
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:08,290
試著站起來
and then, I tried to put my feet on the ground.

466
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,470
還是不行
No.

467
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:10,870
沒法走路
No way to walk.

468
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:11,620
我不得不
I had to go out there

469
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,540
穿起她的裝扮  替她走秀
and walk the show in her look.

470
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,720
那感覺太糟糕了
It felt really horrible.

471
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,700
穿著她的裝扮太難受了
I felt so bad putting that outfit on,

472
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,400
因為那本是她的  不該由我去展現
'cause it wasn't mine, I wasn't supposed to have it.

473
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:25,210
今年  我做了更充足的準備
This year, I'm more than prepared for this show.

474
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,290
Lais  出來讓我們看看吧
Okay, Lais, can we see your outfit?

475
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,300
辣妹喲
Wow! It is hot!

476
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,340
試衣的時候
In the fitting,

477
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,710
我告訴他們  如果我又摔倒
I told them, if I fall again,

478
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:37,590
我一定會揮著翅膀飛起來
of course I'm gonna use my wings to fly.

479
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:41,390
因為去年你出了意外  所以今年
Because of what happened to you last year, we wanted you to know

480
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:44,370
我們希望你來走這個單元的開場
that we're going to have you open the section of the show

481
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:46,370
叫作"天堂飛鳥"
which is called "Birds of Paradise."

482
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,000
感謝你
: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you...

483
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,970
抱歉
I'm sorry.

484
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:54,520
今晚  我無比興奮和快樂
Tonight, I'm more than excited, happy.

485
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:56,340
也很緊張
Nervous.

486
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:58,160
我希望Lais今年
I want for Lais, this year,

487
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,460
能走一場最美妙的秀

希望一切都如她所願
to have whatever she wants.

490
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:06,520
我們都會在她身後支持她
We're all gonna be behind her this year, and be, like,

491
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,680
為她歡呼
"Yeah!"

492
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:10,980
我一定會在後台支持她
I will definitely find Lais backstage.

祝她享受最美時刻
I want her to just have the best time.

494

?Let's go! ?

601
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,640
我最開始接觸的是Twitter
I started with Twitter.

602
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,240
我從那裡得到所有的消息
That's where I get all of my news.

603
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,260
沒有Instagram沒法活啊
I would die without Instagram.

604
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,070
我覺得Facebook很棒

00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:45,370
不好意思
Cara Delevingne. Sorry.

608
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:49,060
她在社交媒體上很有影響力
She's remarkably powerful in social media.

609
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,390
這很好啊
That's a good point, though, yeah.

610
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,330
網絡平台很自由
There's so much freedom.

611
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:57,330
沒有任何限制  暢所欲言
There is no boundaries; you can say whatever you want.

612

她特別大膽

613
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,060
我沒考慮太多  想做什麼就做什麼

614
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,600
我喜歡她這態度

我在Instagram上有290萬粉絲

總共得有上千萬的粉絲
Collectively, it's in the tens of millions.

618
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,650
我每隔三四分鐘
LILY: I pick up my phone

619
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,830
就會拿起手機看看
at least every three to four minutes.

620
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,780
每次打開手機  都會看到新的東西
Every time you pick it up, there's something else to look at.

621
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:16,020
我發的大多都關於
I like to post a balance

622
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,610
家庭  工作和慈善的東西
between family, work, and charity.

623
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:19,930
鼓舞人心的名人名言

624
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,620
積極向上的消息
Positive messages.

625
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:24,430
有時我發了不該發的照片
Sometimes I post photos I shouldn't.

626
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,780
我所擁有的一切
In one second, I could

627
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,270
就可能立刻毀於一旦
screw up everything I have.

628
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,630
就好像按了一個巨大的紅色按鈕
It's like the big red button.

629
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:31,660
一切瞬間爆炸
And everything explodes.

630
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,630
小心哦
Be careful.

631
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:35,180
悔推  你不能發任何讓你後悔的東西
tweegret-- You shouldn't tweegret anything.

632
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,640
我想我以前刪過一些東西
I feel like I've deleted something before,

633
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,210
但我不記得是什麼了
but I can't remember what it is.

634
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:43,360
-刪除  -我還沒碰到情況糟糕到
Delete. I haven't had, like, a shocking moment

635
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,650
我得找我的經紀人  讓他"快刪掉"
that I had to get... My agency is like, "Get that off!"

636
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:47,100
Instagram蒙羞
instashame.

637
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,880
生命苦短  沒空在Instagram上蒙羞
Life is too short for instashame.

638
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:50,250
隨便去谷歌搜一搜
You can just go on Google

639
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,730
很容易就搜到我的屁股了
and see my butt anyway.

640
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:52,940
太瘋狂了
That's crazy.

641
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,080
咱們現在應該幹點壞事兒
We should do something bad right now.

642
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,310
-我知道  有"助"形象  -沒錯
I know, it'd be great for our image. Yeah.

643
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,860
這個品牌在世界上如此聞名
One of the reasons the brand is so

644
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:01,790
也得益於她們那些社交活動
well-known worldwide is because of their social activity.

645
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:02,830
這也是工作的一部分
It's part of the job.

646
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:03,590

653
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,680
其他人為我第一次表演而緊張
Makes me nervous that other people are nervous for me

654
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,740
這也讓我很緊張
for being here for the first time.

655
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,890
