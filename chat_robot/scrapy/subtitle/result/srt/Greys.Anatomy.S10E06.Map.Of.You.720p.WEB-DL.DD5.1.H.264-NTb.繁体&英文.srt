研究人員目前正在
Researchers are currently working

18
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,440
繪制人類大腦架構圖
to make a map of the human brain.

19
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,140
這興許是有史以來最復雜的
It may be the most complex map

20
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,470
架構
ever created...

21
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,880
-早安  -早安
- Good morning. - Good morning.

22
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,120
上十億的神經發生萬億次的神經傳遞
Billions of neurons making trillions of connections.

23
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,640
而最初  它們看似完全無章可循
At first glance, they seem completely random.

24
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:34,650
小心燙
Careful. Hot.

25
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,320
然而  它們并非沒有規律
But there is nothing random about them.

26
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,150
這些神經傳遞都是有章可循
All these connections have to happen

27
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,390
并共有一套機制
in a specific pattern.

28
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,960
每種存在都有自己的功能
It is designed for a function.

29
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:58,670
這些傳遞決定了我們的一切  包括
These connections determine everything about us,

30
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:00,890
我們所愛的
what we love...

31
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,070
深惡痛絕的
what we hate...

32
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:05,740
我們的言語
what we say...

33
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:07,940
我們的行為
what we do...

34
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,490
我們做的每一個動作
Every action we take.

35
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,500
把手張開  米基
Open your hand, okay, Mickey?

36
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,000
這樣么
Like this?

37
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,880
正是  就這樣
Exactly. Like that.

38
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,810
叼爆了
Yeah, baby!

39
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:24,090
好的  現在合上
Okay, now close it.

40
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:25,510
不錯
Oh, yeah!

41
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:28,450
他想著各種動作時  我們看到大腦的
As he thinks about movements, we see brain activity

42
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:31,050
這  還有這  開始發亮
here and here. These areas lighting up.

43
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,060
這個腦機接口讓一切變為可能
Now the brain-computer interface is the key

44
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,210
即使是像米基這樣的四肢癱患者
to new possibilities, whether it be robotic prosthetics...

45
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,690
裝的機械假肢
for quadriplegics like Mickey...

46
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:39,990
還能讓我再次完爆俄羅斯方塊
Or letting me kick ass at "Tetris" again.

47
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,490
大家伙來看這個
Hey, check this out, you guys.

48
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,580
不費吹灰之力啊
Hang loose!

49
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,100
誒  托瑞斯醫生呢
Hey, where's Dr. Torres?

50
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:49,980
她怎么能錯過這個
How's she missing this?

51
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,370
歷史性的突破啊
This is the best that we've ever done.

52
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,960
肖恩  再給她發個短信
Shane, text her again, will you?

53
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,510
-有什么不對勁嗎  -顳葉沒有任何反應
- Is something wrong? - There's not a lot of temporal lobe activity.

54
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,460
這里沒有發亮
Nothing lights up here.

55
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,790
-是不是傳感器連接的問題  -但愿如此
- Is it a bad connection in the sensor? - I hope so.

56
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,480
如果不是傳感器  那就是他大腦有問題了
If not, it's a bad connection in his brain.

57
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,050
給米基做個磁共振
Schedule Mickey for an M.R.I.

58
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,750
這個我出門的時候帶錯了
I brought this from home accidentally.

59
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,550
麻煩你把它和我那些尿片放一起吧
Can you just put it in with my diaper bag and stuff?

60
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,600
然后  我等會去找托瑞斯
And, uh, I'll try and find Torres.

61
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,790
感覺如何  小二年
What's up, second year?

62
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,750
-更上一層樓了喲  -這都是發的么
- This is a step up, right? - Are these assigned?

63
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,120
對啊  我們衣服上都繡了名字
Yes. There's a lab coat with your name.

64
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,620
你到底在高興什么啊
What are you so happy about?

65
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,290
才不告訴你  
Can't tell you.

66
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,930
你肯定想知道  但不可說
You wish I could, but I can't.

67
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,250
所以就不要問啦
So please don't ask.

68
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,370
-怎么連個門都沒了  -就是啊
- Why are there no doors on these? - I know, right?

69
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,270
姨媽棉條都沒地兒藏了
Like, "Hello, tampons. Meet everyone."

70
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,030
海瑟·布魯克斯醫生

71
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,180
大伙兒  竟然有給海瑟·布魯克斯的白大褂
You guys, there's a coat here for Heather Brooks.

72
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,620
-天哪  -真的么
- Oh, my god. - Seriously?

73
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,270
他近來很怪啊
Okay, is he being weird?

74
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,550
沒過測試么
Did he fail the exam?

75
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,520
他直接離開了  都沒來一起慶祝
He left right after. He didn't come celebrate.

76
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,840
還有  他竟然親了我
Also, he kissed me.

77
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,610
說的跟真的似的  想得到挺美
Oh, yeah, he kissed her. It could be that.

78
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:55,270
完全能理解  我自己也有小秘密
I totally get it. I've got a secret thing going, too.

79
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,530
竟然沒咖啡  糟透了
There's no coffee here. This is bad.

80
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,290
只能告訴你某人親了我
I can't tell you who kissed me, though.

81
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,000
嗨
Hey.

82
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,910
嗨  我今早從你床上起來
Hey! I woke up at your place...

83
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,270
-發現又是我一人  -噢  我晚上在外頭
- alone, again. - Yeah, I was out late.

84
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,550
連著三晚都是這樣
This has been three nights now.

85
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,710
對  我每晚都出去了  沒別的原因
Yeah, I've been, uh, going out. That--that's all.

86
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:15,280
我的實習測試過了  你都沒打電話來問我
I passed my intern exam. I never heard from you.

87
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,180
是不是出什么事了
Is there something going on?

88
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,660
阿歷克斯  回答我
Alex, talk to me.

89
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,050
阿歷克斯
Alex?

90
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,930
終于走了  我還以為她不走了呢
Ugh. I thought she would never leave.

91
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,730
-怎么  -你收到我的短信了么
- Hmm? - So you got my texts?

92
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:33,900
我通過了測試
I passed my intern exam.

93
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,160
當然  我也回了啊
Yeah, yeah, I did. I-I replied.

94
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,330
回了  "恭喜"
I-I wrote "Congratulations."

95
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:40,120
我還想著能見見你呢
I hoped I would see you.

96
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,670
畢竟那晚我倆過得挺愉快嘛
I had such an amazing time the other night.

97
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,860
對  挺愉快的 
Yeah, it was fun.

98
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,310
我覺得  我們可以更進一步
I feel like I'm ready to... take it further--

99
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,130
這個  也許不是個好主意
Um, you know, um, it's-- it's not a good idea,

100
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,890
是啊  上班不該談的
Um... at work?

101
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,270
完全理解
I totally get it.

102
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,280
-那今晚見  -噢
- See you tonight? - Mm-hmm.

103
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,140
你呼我
You paged me?

104
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,490
愛德華茲醫生  這是本·博斯克
Dr. Edwards, Ben Bosco,

105
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:03,760
-還有他妻子喬伊斯  -你好
- his wife Joyce. - Hi.

106
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,170
他踝關節骨折了
He's got an ankle fracture.

107
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:06,850
我們當時在機場的傳送走道上跑
That moving walkway thing at the airport--

108
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,470
因為要去趕阿拉斯加的飛機
We were running to catch our connection to Alaska--

109
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,970
去那看北極光嘛
Ahh, to see the northern lights.

110
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:12,520
結果他崴了一下
Then he steps off that thing,

111
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,010
然后我就聽到了
and I heard it. I heard it just go

112
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,400
-”?”的一聲  -就像劇烈的剎車聲
- crack. - Like the whole world slammed on the brakes,

113
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,250
-而我還在繼續跑  -于是就來這了
- and I kept going. - And here we are.

114
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,580
給他做個全身檢查  再喊骨科醫生來會診
He's gonna need a full workup and an ortho consult.

115
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,550
再做個胸腔照片  因為可能會要做手術
Also get a chest x-ray, 'cause it might be surgical.

116
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:23,690
記得告訴我結果
Keep me posted.

117
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,700
好了  我先去安排X光
Okay. I will get those x-rays.

118
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,380
-抱歉  -抱歉
- Oh! Excuse me. - Sorry. Oh! Sorry.

119
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,770
-你確定這沒關系  -我喊你來的  沒事
- You're sure it's not weird? - I called you.

120
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,480
羅賓斯還不知道我們在交往吧
Robbins doesn't know that we're dating, does she?

121
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:33,140
因為我可不想靠這個
'cause I just don't want to trade on our...

122
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,410
不管這是什么 換參觀手術的機會
Whatever this is to, uh, get to observe a surgery.

123
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:36,400
她不知道
No.

124
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:39,000
很好  我只是想專業點  你懂的
Good. I just like to keep it professional, you know?

125
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,230
-工作嘛  -當然
- At work. - Yeah, of course.

126
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,950
那個
Um, hey, uh...

127
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,390
真不能告訴別人么  因為我已經告訴幾個了
Are we not telling people? 'cause I told a couple people.

128
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,170
當然可以
Yeah, you could.

129
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,230
該告訴嘛
Uh, you should.

130
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,940
我也會告訴啦
I would.

131
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:51,610
那就好
Good. Good.

132
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,610
好了  既然是工作
Well, we are at work. So...

133
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,340
-多謝你請我來  -沒問題
- Thanks for the call. - Yeah.

134
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,920
-抱歉  -你好
- Oh. Excuse me. - Hi. Hello.

135
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,950
上班還帶女友來了
Bring your girlfriend to work day?

136
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,440
羅賓斯要給一個三月大的的畸胎瘤嬰兒做手術
Robbins has a teratoma in a 3-month,

137
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,170
而  艾瑪
And, uh, Emma--

138
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,270
瑪琳醫生
Doctor, uh, Marling--

139
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,690
想看看
is gonna observe.

140
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,310
真貼心啊
That's sweet.

141
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,150
這樣不會太奇怪吧  是嗎
This isn't gonna be weird, is it?

142
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,810
對我來說  不會
For me? Please.

143
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,150
對她來說會很奇怪嗎
Will it be weird for her?

144
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,240
我是說  她是那種會被前任嚇跑的人嗎
I mean is she-- is she the type to get freaked out by the ex?

145
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,460
該死
Damn it.

146
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,400
梅
Mer...

147
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:27,880
你在干什么
What's going on?

148
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,310
沒什么  我在
Oh, nothing. I'm--

149
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:33,870
我在決定選哪個研究項目
I'm just, uh, trying to decide on a research project.

150
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,860
有什么可選的
Decide between what?

151
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,360
沒什么  我能搞定
Nothing. I got it.

152
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,560
疼痛感不會消失的
This pain isn't going away.

153
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,550
我的左肩一直在疼
It's a constant pain in my left shoulder.

154
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,190
您覺得是什么原因引起的呢
And what do you think is causing that?

155
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,900
是不是摔著肩膀了
Were you injured in a fall?

156
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,290
你告訴我啊  你是我醫生
You tell me. You're my doctor.

157
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,650
對  抱歉
Right. Sorry.

158
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:57,050
只是你也是我的老師
It's just that you're also my teacher.

159
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,040
打擾一下  貝利醫生
Excuse me, Dr. Bailey...

160
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,740
你記不記得在哪讀到過一個未完成的
Do you remember reading somewhere

161
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,170
研究報告  是關于髂門靜脈移植的
about unfinished research on iliac-portal vein grafts?

162
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,590
-怎么了  -今天是上交
- Why? - Tonight is the deadline

163
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,900
國家衛生研究院研究基金申請的最后一天
to submit for the N.I.H. research grant I want.

164
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,350
我現在不確定
And I'm having trouble deciding

165
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,900
是選擇局部缺血...
between ischemia--

166
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,970
你要做出一番事業啊
Ah, you're peeing on a tree.

167
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,260
作為主治醫生的第一年都害怕搞砸
Yeah, first year attending scared of screwing up.

168
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,310
所以她選了那些簡單的病例
So, um, she takes the easy cases.

169
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,070
保持低調
She keeps a low profile.

170
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,170
但主治醫生的第二年就得有突出表現
But second year attending has got to step it up--

171
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:25,140
選一些典型病例  發表研究報告
take the flashy cases, publish the research,

172
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,550
確定研究領域  干出一番事業
mark her territory. Pee on some trees.

173
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,420
髂門靜脈  記不記得
Portal veins... any bells?

174
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,150
那是你母親的研究
It was your mother's.

175
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:35,830
"門靜脈插補術和髂靜脈移植"
"Portal vein interposition with iliac vein graft."

176
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,060
愛麗絲生病時正在研究這個
Ellis was working on it when she got sick.

177
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,980
在你給我的某本日記里有這個
It's in one of the journals you gave me.

178
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,890
該死
Oh, crap.

179
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,520
我有個同樣的杯子
I have a mug like that.

180
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:47,170
如果對于我的肩部疼痛
If you don't come back with a solid diagnosis

181
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,080
你無法給出明確的診斷
for my shoulder pain,

182
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,530
我就得要求你離開了
I'm gonna kick you off my case.

183
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:51,990
是作為老師還是病人
As my teacher or my patient?

184
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,930
出去
Get out.

185
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:00,150
我得給韋伯的肩部疼痛做出診斷
I need a differential diagnosis for Webber's shoulder pain.

186
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,070
關節炎  黏液囊炎
Arthritis, bursitis...

187
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,830
任何年齡大的人都有的"炎癥"
Any of the old people "-itises."

188
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,430
還在等我那個踝骨骨折病人的胸部CT
Still waiting on my broken ankle's chest scans.

189
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,060
你居然有咖啡
You got coffee.

190
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,580
阿歷克斯不跟我說話
So Alex isn't talking to me.

191
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,670
我猜是因為我逼著他
I think it's 'cause I pushed him to

192
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:12,950
和他游手好閑的老爸說話
talk to his deadbeat dad.

193
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,580
阿歷克斯有個老爸
Alex has a dad?

194
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:15,810
你跟肖恩談過了沒
Have you talked to Shane?

195
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,820
我還是希望這事能平息下去
I'm still hoping it'll go away.

196
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,010
肖恩親了我  我又沒親他
Shane kissed me. I didn't kiss him.

197
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,360
這是他的問題
It's his problem.

198
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,910
他的心臟上有個巨大的腫瘤
He has a huge tumor in his heart.

199
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:27,850
不
No...

200
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:31,610
他只是踝骨骨折了啊
He has a broken ankle.

201
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:45,730
好的  謝謝
Okay, yeah. Thank you.

202
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:48,090
-你沒事吧  -對啊  怎么了
- You okay? - Yeah, why?

203
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:49,020
我們今天早上測試了
Yeah, we tested the new sensors

204
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,460
米基·溫思勒的新傳感器
with Mickey Wenschler this morning.

205
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,800
結果非常成功
And--and it was a huge success.

206
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,560
但是他一直在問為什么你沒在那
But he kept asking why you weren't there.

207
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,860
你沒有...你沒有收到我的短信嗎
Uh, well, didn't you-- didn't you get my text?

208
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,600
你短信說  "我不去了"
Your text said, "Won't be there."

209
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:00,280
好吧  是這樣子的
Okay, well, uh, here's the thing--

210
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,820
搬回我家讓我覺得
Moving back into my place made me feel like

211
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,450
我真的需要搬回"我家"
I really need to move back into "My place,"

212
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,080
集中精力在成就我本人的事情上
You know, concentrate on what makes me, me.

213
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,720
我研究的是再生軟骨
I do regenerative cartilage.

214
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,430
這也是我的TED演講的主題
It's what my T.E.D. Talk was about--

215
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,140
你到底什么意思
What are you saying?

216
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,840
我不打算繼續那個項目了
I'm not going forward with the project.

217
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,990
而你應該繼續下去
You should totally run with it, though.

218
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,190
不  這是你的項目
No, this is your project.

219
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,560
米基是你的病人  我沒法做
Mickey's your patient. I can't do this.

220
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,100
我沒有時間  梅瑞迪斯和我
I don't have time. Meredith and I

221
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,130
得花大量時間照顧孩子們
are in over our heads with kids,

222
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,490
而且她也需要時間
and she needs time, too.

223
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:19,850
那我們放棄這個項目吧
So maybe we just drop it.

224
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:20,900
也沒什么壞處  對嗎
No harm done, right?

225
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,950
那你去跟米基·溫思勒說吧
Oh, and tell that to Mickey Wenschler.

226
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,220
米基會沒事的
Mickey will be all right.

227
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,730
愛德華茲  我剛才檢查了踝骨骨折
Edwards, I just saw your broken ankle.

228
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,290
不用手術  夾板固定就行
No surgery, just splint it.

229
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:28,080
他不會沒事的  那會殺了他的
He won't be all right. It's gonna kill him.

230
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,870
我知道
I know, right?

231
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,130
我做不到啊
I can't do this.

232
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,260
-這是你干的嗎  -我...
- Did you do this? - Uh, I...

233
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,010
我得去找凱普納  
I need to find Kepner.

234
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:36,840
不行  這是誰打碎的
No, who broke this?

235
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,690
是我  抱歉  是我摔碎了
Yeah, sorry. I dropped it.

236
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,320
楊醫生  你能看一下這個嗎
Dr. Yang, uh, would you look at this?

237
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,380
-天哪  -這很糟糕  對嗎
- Holy--wow! - I mean, it's bad, right?

238
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,100
-你不能用這個的  -肖恩  等會說
- Look, this wasn't yours to use-- - Shane, not now!

239
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,380
左心室有一大片的動靜脈畸形瘤
This is a rat's nest of an A.V.M. in the left ventricle.

240
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,110
說不定已經擴展到心臟瓣膜了
It's probably pushing in on the valve.

241
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,890
如果不治療  他只能活幾個月
If it's not treated, he'll be dead in months.

242
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,450
他是因為踝骨骨折來的
He came in for a broken ankle.

243
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,680
現在我得去告訴他  他要死了
And now I have to tell them he's dying.

244
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,520
讓我看看血檢結果
Okay, let me look at the blood work,

245
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,970
然后我們一起告訴他們
and we'll tell them together.

246
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,260
天哪  太謝謝你了
God, thank you so much.

247
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,270
這地方像個迷宮
This place is a maze.

248
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,980
-那是羅賓斯醫生  -對
- That's Dr. Robbins? - Yeah.

249
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,510
那你是
And you are?

250
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,610
-羅賓斯醫生  我是艾瑪·瑪琳  -對
- Dr. Robbins, Emma Marling. - Oh, right.

251
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,780
-對  你是來觀摩手術的  -我希望
- Right, right, you're observing. - And I'm scrubbing in...

252
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,470
我能參加
I hope.

253
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,840
墨菲  抱歉  加上瑪琳醫生
Murphy, I'm sorry. With Dr. Marling,

254
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,160
我覺得手術臺都滿了  下次吧
I think the table's full. Um, next time?

255
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:23,690
我們剛給小艾琳的父母講解了手術
Okay, so we just gave little Erin's parents the pre-game,

256
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:24,840
然后我們就帶她去做手術
and we're about to take her up.

257
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,860
墨菲  你能帶她去找手術服嗎
Murphy, will you show her where to get some scrubs?

258
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,620
觀摩醫生
Visiting surgeon?

259
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,640
對  她是婦科和兒科醫生  正在研究
Yeah, maternal/fetal. She's researching

260
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:35,860
微創治療子宮畸胎瘤
minimally invasive in-utero teratomas.

261
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:38,130
她很性感  我只是說
And she's hot. I'm just saying

262
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,940
我會在一旁看著你的  以防你就范
It's good that I'll be there to chaperone.

263
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,170
怎么  不能拿這個開玩笑嗎
What, we're not joking about this yet?

264
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,130
手術室見了
See you in there.

265
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:50,800
給你
Here.

266
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,920
這是我母親的日記  你從哪找到的
This is my mother's journal. Where did you get this?

267
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,940
韋伯...讓我去他家了
Webber... made me go to his house.

268
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,500
我還要去搞清楚他的肩膀到底為什么疼
And I need to figure out why his shoulder hurts.

269
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,020
-我可以走了嗎  -可以
- Can I go? - Yeah.

270
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,980
-你們這是搞什么  -研究基金
- What was that about? - Research funding.

271
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,340
我正在糾結到底是局部缺血
I'm trying to decide between an ischemia study

272
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,780
還是我母親曾經做過的門靜脈研究
and this portal vein thing that my mother was working on.

273
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,710
做那個
Ooh! Do that.

274
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:08,580
可是這個都已經做好一半了
It's half-baked.

275
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,470
再加上我不喜歡沾我媽的光
A-and I don't like trading on my mother's name.

276
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,220
不  這完全是你的杰作
No, it's your story.

277
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,280
杰出的年輕外科醫生完成了
"Brilliant young surgeon finishes work

278
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,570
她去世母親未完成的工作
of dead brilliant mother surgeon"--

279
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,820
這太順理成章了  你要打響自己的名號
It writes itself. Invest in your brand.

280
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,910
你把我說的好像是個軟飲似的
You make me sound like a soft drink.

281
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:19,850
我也正是這么做的呀
That's what I'm doing.

282
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:21,490
重新對自己投資
Yeah, I'm reinvesting in myself.

283
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:22,970
-就沖著這個  -一起努力吧
- That's the perfect reason... - Right?

284
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:23,970
我也不干
not to.

285
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,780
肖恩  給你  好東西
Shane, here you go. Some good stuff in there.

286
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,350
-好好享受吧  -你不會明白的
- Enjoy. - Ugh. You don't get it.

287
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,950
這是米基的核磁共振結果
These are Mickey's M.R.I.s?

288
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:37,670
謝博德醫生  我想問您一下
Dr. Shepherd...I wondered if you'd mind

289
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,740
今天結束后  我跟別的醫生可以嗎
if I switch services after today.

290
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:42,470
-你是我點名要求的  -我知道
- I asked for you specifically. - I know.

291
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,590
我知道去年發生在你和布魯克斯之間的事
Look, what happened last year between you and Brooks,

292
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,140
也許是我當時有失公平
I think I may have been unfair,

293
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,330
而我也一直希望找個機會彌補
and I was hoping for a chance to make it right.

294
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,350
所以說  現在布魯克斯不在了
So...now that Brooks is gone...

295
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,480
-就由我頂替她  -該死的
- I get to take her place? - Oh, hell.

296
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,340
怪不得傳感器不發光呢
Well, that's why the sensors weren't lighting.

297
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,690
他長了個神經膠質瘤
He has a glioma.

298
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:59,700
你能治好他嗎
Can you treat it?

299
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,120
我可以用膠試試
I could try hitting it with some glue.

300
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,020
-膠  -栓塞膠  一般用在腦動靜脈畸形
- Glue? - Embolization glue. We use it for A.V.M.s.

301
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,580
我們把超能膠注射到血管中
We pump superglue into the vessels,

302
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:08,070
膠水凝固后便切斷了通往腫瘤的血液
the glue hardens, cuts off blood to the tumor.

303
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,000
我可以試試看
I could try it. Mm...

304
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,450
不行  血管直接連接到腦干
No. It goes all the way to the brain stem.

305
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:13,950
-太危險了  -那動手術呢
- It's too dangerous. - And going in surgically?

306
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,760
結果也是一樣
It's the same thing.

307
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,970
恐怕也是弊大于利
I'm afraid of doing more harm than good.

308
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,190
這是一個非常致命的腫塊
It's a very deadly mass.

309
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,210
是個巨大的靜脈畸形
It's a large veinous malformation...

310
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:25,320
如果不馬上加以治療
and without intervention immediately,

311
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,010
恐怕結果不堪設想
I'm afraid the prognosis is very bad.

312
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,600
沒錯  就是那個東西
Yeah, that's the thing.

313
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:33,420
我這幾年一直帶著它活的
Um, I have been dying of that for years.

314
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,050
你知道你心臟有腫瘤卻只字不提
You knew about this and you didn't mention it?

315
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,440
-抱歉  -在你的醫療記錄上沒有
- I'm sorry. - In your medical history, there's --

316
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,620
我滿腦子都是錯過航班的事
I was so hung up on missing our plane --

317
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:42,490
這是個不能動手術的動靜脈畸形瘤
It's an inoperable A.V.M.

318
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:44,780
他大概在一年
He was diagnosed with it, what, a y --

319
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,120
-一年半  -沒錯  前年就確診了
- Year and a half -- - Year before last, yeah.

320
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,840
-一月份  -而且是晚期
- January. - And terminal.

321
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,740
那我們還能怎么辦
So...what are you gonna do?

322
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,510
我們就辭了工作  把銀行里的錢都取了出來
So we just quit our jobs, cashed out all our accounts,

323
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:55,810
-然后開始旅游  -沒錯  開始干各種事
- and just started traveling. - Yeah, just doing stuff --

324
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:58,590
旅游  活動  基本上把剩余的一切時間
trips, activities, basically cramming as much living

325
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,820
都盡可能地填滿
as we could into the time we have left.

326
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,730
好吧  你的醫生  他  他
Okay, did your doctor -- did he or -- or --

327
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:05,110
或是她有沒有試過給你用輻射治療
or she, uh, try treating it with radiation?

328
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,880
-試過了  -靜脈卷呢
- Yeah, tried that. - Intravenous coiling?

329
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,890
也試過了  沒用
Mm-hmm. Yeah, no dice.

330
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:10,320
還有硬化劑
And the sclerosing agents --

331
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,780
那移植呢  或是
Uh, what about a transplant? Or what about...

332
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,330
還有很多
There are a lot of --

333
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,350
親愛的
Sweetie...

334
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,850
我知道這很難接受
I know it's hard.

335
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,030
對我們來說也是一樣
It was hard for us, too.

336
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:22,740
但是你必須學會放手
But you have to let it go.

337
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,770
因為我對此無能為力
Because there is nothing I can do about it.

338
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:27,590
很抱歉  最好的選擇就是
I'm sorry. The best course

339
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:30,970
不去管它  然后期待最好的結果
is to leave it alone and hope for the best.

340
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:33,150
但研究還是要繼續的  對吧
We'll keep doing the study, right?

341
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,670
-拜托  為什么不行  -因為太危險了
- Come on. Why? - Because it is too dangerous.

342
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:38,060
而且腫瘤可能會導致異常結果
Also the tumor could give us abnormal results.

343
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,710
那你要把腫瘤取出來呢
What if you take the tumor out?

344
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,430
-那我可以繼續做實驗了  -可以  但是
- I could keep doing the testing. - You could, but --

345
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,350
那就把它取出來呀
Then take it out, man!

346
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,010
我們離成功已經近在咫尺了
We're so close, right?

347
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:48,450
今天早上的結果跟上一次的相比
This morning, I was miles beyond anything

348
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,710
-簡直是天壤之別  -太危險了
- what I did last time -- - It's too dangerous.

349
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,970
我們得把你送進手術室  取出你的傳感器
We're gonna take you out there, remove your sensors,

350
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:52,780
然后還要縫合你的
and then we're gonna close

351
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,170
-開顱術  -要是我不簽同意書呢
- your craniotomy -- - What if I don't consent?

352
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:55,640
什么
What?

353
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,450
要是我說  除非你把我的腫瘤也取出來
What if I say you can't take your sensors back

354
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,030
不然就別想拿回你的傳感器呢
unless you take my tumor, too?

355
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,070
米基  我必須把傳感器取出來
Mickey, I need to take them out.

356
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,940
對不起  哥們
Sorry, bud.

357
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,560
拒絕訪問
Access denied.

358
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:06,580
除非把我的腫瘤摘除
You're not going in my head

359
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,400
不然你就別想碰我的腦子
unless you're leaving with that tumor.

360
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:15,410
能用上電熱封口器真是好呀
Lucky you use electro-thermal sealers.

361
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:17,800
我們做子宮內部手術時就用不了  太大了
They're too big to get in there when we do these in-utero.

362
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:18,680
忍耐我一下  艾瑪
Bear with me, Emma.

363
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,870
阿歷克斯  我需要你的建議
Alex, I need your advice.

364
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,730
如果你跟某人有了一夜情
What's your strategy when you have a one-night-stand --

365
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:24,450
都算不上是一夜情  就只是親熱了一下
not even -- you just make out with someone,

366
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,260
然后那個人就黏上來了  你怎么辦
and then they get way too attached?

367
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,490
你知道誰是這樣的人嗎
You know who's like that?

368
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:28,950
莉亞·墨菲
Leah Murphy.

369
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,300
真的嗎
Really?

370
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,350
是啊  我跟她也就上了一次要不就兩次床
Yeah, I slept with her one, maybe two times.

371
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,660
然后她就跟超能膠一樣粘著我
She stuck to me like glue.

372
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,850
那小妞從不認識你到跟你說"我愛你"
That girl goes from zero to "I love you"

373
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,190
只需要七秒
in seven seconds.

374
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,210
我從來從來都沒有過這種感覺
I've never, ever felt this way.

375
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,720
如果我告訴你們這個人是誰的話
And if I tell you guys who it is,

376
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,450
會給我  也會給這個人
it would cause so many problems for me

377
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:45,030
帶來太多問題  而且
and for this person, and...

378
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,270
說不準還會影響整間醫院
god, for the hospital, probably.

379
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,480
所以拜托你們別問
So please don't ask.

380
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,780
會不會是跟心臟相關呢
Could it be heart-related?

381
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,640
-他有心室衰竭  -什么
- He had ventricular failure. - What?

382
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,990
韋伯的肩膀疼
Webber's shoulder hurts.

383
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:54,480
你跟阿歷克斯聊過嗎
Hey, did you talk to Alex?

384
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:56,570
我試過  但是他只是不停地躲我
Yeah, I tried. He just keeps running away.

385
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,930
他這是要甩了你  他當初對我就是這樣的
He's dumping you. It's what he did with me.

386
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:01,130
他會假裝你不存在  直到你真的就不存在了
He'll pretend you're not there until you're not there.

387
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,030
等你不在了
And when you're not there,

388
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,500
他就會跟其他人上床
he'll have sex with someone else.

389
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,460
你干嗎粘我的杯子
Why are you gluing my mug?

390
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,370
這不是你的杯子  這是謝博德的
It's not yours. It's Shepherd's.

391
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,040
這個馬克杯該我負責
The mug was my responsibility.

392
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,800
-你怎么打破了  -她被一顆腫瘤嚇到
- How'd you break it? - She got scared by a tumor.

393
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,210
是腦動靜脈畸形  而且是很可怕的一個
It's an A.V.M., and it's a scary one.

394
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:13,730
完全無法手術
Totally inoperable.

395
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:15,230
估計只能活幾個月了
Guy probably has months to live,

396
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,170
他和他可憐的老婆
and he and is his poor wife

397
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:18,190
想好好度過在一起剩下的時光
are just trying to make the most of their time together.

398
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,770
膠水怎么樣
What about glue?

399
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,330
什么膠水  
What about glue?

400
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:31,850
不好意思  用在腦動靜脈畸形上
I'm sorry. For your A.V.M.--

401
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,160
你的腦動靜脈畸形
this A.V.M.

402
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,310
你看  謝博德醫生一直在說用在神經
Look, Dr. Shepherd was talking about the embolization glue

403
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:37,700
腦動靜脈畸形上的栓塞膠  然后我就想
they use in neuro A.V.M.s, and I wondered--

404
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,540
這種方法有沒有用在心臟上
has this approach ever been used in the heart?

405
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,950
我沒聽說過  所以不行
Not that I'm aware of. So... no.

406
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:45,880
在神經腦動靜脈畸形上用栓塞膠
They glue neuro A.V.M.s

407
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,950
因為腦血管很細微
because they’re microscopic.

408
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:49,350
這些血管太大了
These vessels are huge.

409
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,750
-你是說膠沒用嗎  -我是說
- You saying it won't work? - I'm saying...

410
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,370
我需要很多膠
I'd need a crapload of glue.

411
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:55,910
膠不起作用
I'm saying the glue won't work,

412
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,480
化療也不起作用
the radiation won't work,

413
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,850
我不想進行手術
and I don't want to go in surgically.

414
00:14:58,850 --> 00:14:59,810
風險太大  會致命
I risk killing him.

415
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:02,330
所以他用腦子里的傳感器來威脅你嗎
So he's holding your sensors hostage in his skull?

416
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:04,630
這不好笑  凱麗  你得和他談談
This is not funny, Callie. You have to talk to him.

417
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,950
他是米基  給他一點時間
It's Mickey. Just give him a few hours.

418
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:07,980
他自己能想明白的
He'll come around.

419
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,110
你不想和他談
You don't want to talk to him

420
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,560
因為你不想看著他
because you don't want to look him in the eye

421
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,510
然后告訴他  你放棄了
and tell him you're bailing on this.

422
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,630
顯然你也不想告訴他
And you certainly don't want to tell him

423
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,400
你為什么放棄
why you're bailing.

424
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,910
為什么
Why is that?

425
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:27,450
你為亞利桑那開啟這個項目
You started this project for Arizona.

426
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:31,230
你對她沒有興趣后  對這個項目也沒興趣
When you lost interest in her, you lost interest in this.

427
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,670
你讓你的私人問題
You're letting your personal problems

428
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,140
阻礙了幾個月的研究
get in the way of months of research.

429
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,340
你不是也在做一樣的事情嗎
Well, you're doing the same thing.

430
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:37,130
你說過你要放棄這個研究
You said you were done with the study

431
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:38,300
多花時間陪孩子
to spend time with your kids.

432
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,360
這完全不同  
That's completely different.

433
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,960
為什么不同呢  德里克
Oh, why is it different, Derek?

434
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,050
因為你的家庭美滿  
'Cause your family's perfect,

435
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:43,030
而我的卻支離破碎嗎
and mine's a disaster?

436
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,730
因為你放棄這個項目去支持你老婆
Because you're leaving the study to support your wife,

437
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:45,970
而我放棄是為了忘記我的老婆嗎
and I'm doing it to forget mine?

438
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:47,230
我懂你經受了什么
I know what you're going through.

439
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,480
你什么都不懂
You don't know anything about it.

440
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:53,620
你們找到了解決的辦法
You guys have figured it out how to make the pieces fit.

441
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,000
而我本以為我也做到了  但
And I thought we did, too, but...

442
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,860
我只能靠自己撐過去  所以
I'm figuring this out for myself now, so...

443
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:03,690
對我寬容點  好嗎
Just bear with me, okay?

444
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,820
我會和米基談的
I will talk to Mickey.

445
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,090
我將問你一系列的問題
And I'm gonna ask you a series of questions.

446
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,320
你打網球嗎
"Are you a tennis player?"

447
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,720
神啊
Oh, good lord.

448
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,940
你經常用受傷的手臂
"Do you frequently carry heavy loads,

449
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,350
搬重的物品嗎  比如日常用品
groceries, etcetera, with your injured arm?"

450
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,290
我在這張床上躺了一個月了
I've been in this bed a month.

451
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:28,140
我只是想詳盡一些
I'm just trying to be thorough.

452
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:32,720
你最近進行了強烈的性交
"Have you recently engaged in any strenuous sexual--"

453
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,570
這個我就跳過了
I am skipping that one...

454
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,400
這個也跳過
Uh, too, uh...

455
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,370
機器顯示的不是很正常
Uh... I'm not getting a very good reading on,

456
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,000
先生  你
Uh, sir, are you-- oh--oh...

457
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,510
不關網球的事  也不關我心臟的事
It is not my tennis game, and it's not my heart.

458
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,970
看仔細點
Look deeper.

459
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:51,840
滾出去  把那機器也帶走
Now get out, and take that thing with you.

460
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,790
我擦  沒時間搞這個
Oh, come on. I don't have time for this.

461
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,400
胸部創傷缺血再灌注損傷

462
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:12,050
胸部創傷缺血再灌注損傷
"Ischemia reperfusion injury in thoracic trauma"?

463
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:13,420
門靜脈怎么了
What happened to portal veins?

464
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,240
我知道局部缺血很無聊
I know ischemia is boring,

465
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,630
但我媽的門靜脈研究過時了
but my mother's portal vein research is outdated.

466
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,540
我們已經從干細胞里培植出來了
I mean, we've already grafted them from stem cells.

467
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,770
而且我也不想一輩子
And I don't want to spend my life

468
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:22,450
都拿來和我媽作比較
being compared to my mother.

469
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,020
她是位聰明的女人
She was a smart woman.

470
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,180
一輩子都沒拿來和她比可能更差
It might be worse to never be compared to her.

471
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:28,570
我找不到進一步研究的方法了
I can't find a way to take the research further.

472
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:30,820
這個文件也打不出來
And I can't print this damn thing!

473
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,660
你還好嗎
You all right?

474
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,920
我們用3D打印機
We've bio-engineered blood vessels

475
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,570
做了血管
from a 3-d printer.

476
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,090
對啊
Yeah.

477
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:50,990
但我不認為有人做出過門靜脈
But I don't think anyone has ever printed a portal vein.

478
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,930
從沒有人做過
It's never been done before.

479
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:55,630
這個膠是為大腦設計的
The glue is designed for use in your brain,

480
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:58,930
但我想在你的心臟上試一試
but I would like to try it in your heart.

481
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:00,270
這是一個大膽的方法
It--it's a bold approach.

482
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,870
等等  你是說
Wai--are you-- are you saying that--

483
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:04,520
我有信心可以治好你
I am optimistic that it could save your life.

484
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,370
完了
That's awful.

485
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:09,640
什么
I'm sorry?

486
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:14,560
在得知本的診斷結果后  你知道的
After got Ben's diagnosis, well, I mean, you--you know,

487
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,880
我們賣了所有東西
we--we--we sold everything.

488
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,590
花光了所有積蓄
We--we cashed out all our accounts.

489
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:20,610
我們刷爆了一張又一張信用卡
We maxed out our credit cards and more credit cards.

490
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:21,960
我們去了歐洲  去了印度
We went to Europe. We went to India.

491
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,170
還去了摩洛哥
We went to Morocco.

492
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,450
我們租了一整座島
We rented a whole island.

493
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:27,920
我們坐飛機去體驗失重
We--we went up in that plane where you get to be weightless.

494
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,270
一人五千美元
That's 5 grand a pop.

495
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:31,420
我們去了十一次  然后買了一艘船
We went up 11 times-- and then bought a boat.

496
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:32,850
再然后我們把它點了  
And then we blew it up,

497
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,270
因為我們想看燒船的情景
'cause we wanted to watch it burn.

498
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:38,680
我們欠了一屁股的債
We owe creditors hundreds of thousands of dollars.

499
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,250
-你們打算怎么還這些錢  -人生保險
- How were you planning to pay for-- - Life insurance.

500
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,310
-本計劃的天衣無縫  -我以為是的
- Ben's a very good planner. - I thought I was.

501
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:45,270
但沒想到會活下去
I didn't plan for surviving.

502
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,190
但不管怎樣  親愛的
But still, hon...

503
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:52,670
我們還是得試一試  對嗎
We... we gotta try it, right?

504
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:54,820
等等
Wait.

505
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,960
風險有多大
What are the risks?

506
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:00,220
如我所說
Well, as I said,

507
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,610
從沒在心臟上做過這個手術
this has never been done before on a beating heart.

508
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:03,840
我可能會死嗎
Could I die?

509
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,380
我可能死在手術臺上嗎
Could I die on the table?

510
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,410
有可能
It's possible.

511
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:13,710
那還有希望
Then there's hope.

512
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,680
在手術室給我準備一個C型臂
I want a c-arm set up in the O.R.

513
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,980
-我可能會做胸骨切開術  -真的嗎
- I may have to do a crash sternotomy. - Really?

514
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,310
但我不知道會發生什么
Well, I don't know what's gonna happen.

515
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,640
以前又沒做過
This has never been done before.

516
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,120
你覺得我們需要多少動靜脈畸形膠
How much A.V.M. glue do you think we'll need?

517
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,260
剛說了  從沒做過這種
Again, never been done before.

518
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,590
隨時都可能出問題
Err's on the side of all of it.

519
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,320
-在哪  -什么東西在哪
- Where is it? - Where is what?

520
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,930
-我媽的日記  -我怎么會知道
- My mother's journal. - Why would I know?

521
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:36,770
那本黑色的書
The black book--

522
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,070
我今天給你的那個黑色的小本
The little black book I gave you today--

523
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,010
你得還給我  肖恩
I need it back, Shane.

524
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:39,950
好像給愛德華茲了
I think I left it with Edwards.

525
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,180
-愛德華茲  -干嗎
- Edwards! - What?

526
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,360
急診需要這張床  能幫我推一下嗎
E.R. needs this bed. Can you help me?

527
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,800
博斯克先生是怎么了
Hey, and what is going on with Mr. Bosco?

528
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:47,870
腳扭了為什么要被挪去
Why has a broken ankle been moved to pre-op

529
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,870
-做心臟手術的術前準備  -什么
- for a cardiac procedure? - What?

530
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:52,550
你不能就這樣改變療程  還沒有
You can't change the course of treatment like that without...

531
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:54,650
不是我  心臟科診治宣稱無法手術
I didn't. The cardio consult declared it inoperable.

532
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:56,920
那他怎么還做術前準備  誰
So then why is he in pre-op? Who--

533
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,880
-誰做的會診  -是楊醫生
- Who did the consult? - Dr. Yang!

534
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,590
-怎么了  -抱歉  我們剛才在這里
- What? - Sorry. We were in here before,

535
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:03,000
我好像把手機落在這了
and I think I left my... phone.

536
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,250
這是準備做什么手術
Well, what do we have here?

537
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,960
心室動靜脈畸形啊
Oh, a ventricular A.V.M.

538
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,700
我要用膠做液體栓塞
I'm doing liquid embolization with glue.

539
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,430
等等  是用來治腦動脈瘤的膠嗎
Wait, glue for brain aneurysms?

540
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,440
這種手術有人做過么
Has that been tried on a heart before?

541
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,630
謝謝  事實上
Thank you. As a matter of fact,

542
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:18,540
還真沒有
no.

543
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,530
確定能治好么
Are you sure it'll work?

544
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,860
也不確定
That is also a no.

545
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,130
你真是太勇氣可嘉了哦
I-I am impressed with your enormous balls.

546
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:28,350
我還真想在這觀看
I wish I could stick around and watch this.

547
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:31,610
我是克里斯蒂娜
I'm Cristina... by the way.

548
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,740
克里斯蒂娜·楊  知道了吧
Cristina Yang. Just so you know.

549
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,930
我知道  我們見過幾次面
Yeah, I know. We've met a couple of times, actually.

550
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:38,870
我是艾瑪·瑪琳
Emma Marling.

551
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:41,970
我知道  我意思是  我是歐文的
I know. I'm--I'm saying I'm Owen's, um...

552
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,520
前妻
Ex-wife.

553
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,170
對
Yes.

554
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:50,960
沒錯
Right.

555
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,720
這真是太棒了
Well, this looks amazing.

556
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,530
我迫不及待想知道結果了
And I can't wait to hear how it went.

557
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,230
晚安
Good night.

558
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,730
你都不和我道別么
You weren't gonna say good night?

559
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,540
這個啊  我下班了  一會兒見
Oh, hey. I'm off. I'll-- I'll see you later.

560
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,200
會見嗎
Will you?

561
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,460
可能不會  我大概會很晚回去
Probably not. I'll probably be late.

562
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,970
你在跟別人約會嗎
Are you seeing someone else?

563
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:11,950
是不是這樣
Is that what's happening?

564
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,090
我就是想知道
'Cause I just need to know.

565
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:14,990
-不是這樣  -那是怎么回事
- Oh, it's not that. - Then what is it?

566
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,750
跟你沒關系
It's none of your business.

567
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,460
這是我和謝博德之間的事
It is between me and Shepherd,

568
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,030
他該知道的我都說了
and I told him everything he needs to know.

569
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:22,750
米基
Mickey...

570
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:25,820
米基  看著我
Mickey, look at me.

571
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,560
如果我看你  外星人就會贏的
If I do, the aliens will win.

572
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,770
這手術會讓你喪命
This operation could kill you.

573
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:44,640
我沒跟你說過我是怎么變成廢物的吧
I never told you how I became a quad, did I?

574
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:47,950
你發生了車禍
You were in a car accident.

575
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:54,300
是我制造了一場車禍
I caused a car accident...

576
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,770
因為我喝醉了  我喝多了
Because I was drunk. I got drunk,

577
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:59,850
還開車  我撞上了另一輛車
and I drove, and I hit another car,

578
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,060
撞死了兩個十幾歲的女孩
and I killed two teenage girls--

579
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,490
琳賽和謝麗爾
Lindsay and Cheryl.

580
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:10,270
我只能這么待著  廢物一個
So there I am, a pile of garbage.

581
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,220
既不能動又不能離開  什么都干不了
Can't move, can't walk, can't do anything

582
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,550
只能回想我對那些家庭
except think about what I did...

583
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:16,760
犯的錯
to those families.

584
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:23,100
而現在竟然還有人照顧我
I've got people tending to me.

585
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,230
有人喂我吃飯
People feed me,

586
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:27,750
給我刮胡須  給我洗澡
and shave me and clean me,

587
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,150
我不值得他們為我花時間
and I don't deserve their time.

588
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:33,040
我就該死在那輛車里
I deserve... to have died in that car.

589
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,480
我每天都這么想
And I wish I did every day...

590
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,280
已經九年了
for nine years.

591
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:41,460
當你讓我
And when you asked me...

592
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,320
加入這個項目時
to do this...

593
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,420
當我有機會
When I had a chance to do something

594
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,460
做些對別人有利的事情時
affecting someone in a good way...

595
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,020
第一次
For the first time,

596
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,800
我覺得自己有了價值
I thought I was worth having around.

597
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:03,820
如果我死了
If I die,

598
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:07,950
把我的大腦捐去研究  我還能有用
give my brain to science, and I still help.

599
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:12,920
讓我幫助你們
Let me help.

600
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,650
求你了
Please.

601
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:20,080
需要什么嗎
And how can I help you?

602
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,020
是你啊  和昨晚一樣的嗎
Oh, hey. Same as last night?

603
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,420
是的  謝謝
Yeah, thanks.

604
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,510
你是真的喜歡這些人吧
You must really like these guys, huh?

605
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,740
我還是覺得這主意不咋地
I still think it's a bad idea.

606
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,660
我知道  但這是對的
I-I know, but it's the right idea.

607
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:58,930
米基沒什么損失  反而會有所獲
Mickey has nothing to lose and a lot to gain.

608
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,430
好吧  把他排在明早
Okay, I'll schedule him for tomorrow morning.

609
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:05,340
不  等等  我明早不能做
Oh, no, wait. I can't do tomorrow morning.

610
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,640
貝利要做產后優生測試
Bailey has a well-baby exam,

611
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:09,860
我要連做兩個脊椎間板脫位癥手術
I've got back-to-back discotomies,

612
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,130
還有  我得帶佐拉去報舞蹈課
and Zola and I were gonna check out a dance class.

613
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:13,550
只能今晚做了
It's gonna have to be tonight.

614
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,050
佐拉  你和弟弟要回日托所
Zola, you and your brother are gonna have to go back to day care

615
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:17,100
再待一會兒了  好嗎  親愛的
for a little while longer, okay, sweetie?

616
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,110
不用你去了  我來送
No, no, no. I'll take 'em back up. I got it.

617
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:21,200
這邊  來吧  寶貝
Here. Come on. This way, babes.

618
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:22,690
呼羅斯醫生
Page Dr. Ross.

619
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,030
好的
Okay.

620
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:29,630
再加點膠
More glue.

621
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,910
我們的膠快用完了
We're getting to the end of our supply.

622
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:32,910
那就再去拿點
Then go get more.

623
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:34,730
我需要補上這整塊
I think I need to fill this whole thing.

624
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,660
導管卡在靜脈里了
Okay... the catheter is stuck to the vein.

625
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,230
天吶  這玩意真緊
God, this stuff is intense.

626
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,680
這么使勁拽好嗎
Should you be tugging that hard?

627
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:45,090
你想讓我把它留在里面嗎
Well, you want me to leave it in there?

628
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:49,600
好了  搞定了
Okay. Okay, we're good.

629
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,460
你是怎么想到的
How did you come up with this?

630
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:54,420
不知道  就是簡單的聯想
I don't know. I just... connected the dots.

631
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,730
你真是驚奇無限啊  小鯊魚
You are full of surprises, sharky.

632
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:59,840
奇思妙想  又斗勁十足
Innovative instincts and killer instincts--

633
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:02,540
還有什么絕活
What other secrets are hiding in there?

634
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,750
你覺得還有什么
What do you think you'll find?

635
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:07,970
如果不是關節炎  滑囊炎或肌腱套炎
Well, if it's not arthritis or bursitis or rotator cuff,

636
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,610
而且你心臟也沒事  那就不該痛
and your heart's fine, then it can't hurt.

637
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:11,820
除非是牽涉痛導致的神經反跳
Unless it's referred pain, which could be nerve impingement

638
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:13,740
或是橫隔膜受刺激  這樣的話
or diaphragmatic irritation, so...

639
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,340
你根本就不用照X光
You don't need an x-ray.

640
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,170
棒極了
Bravo.

641
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,210
你需要做超聲檢查
You need an ultrasound.

642
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,900
希望你不是認為我懷孕了
Well, I hope you're not thinking I'm pregnant!

643
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,390
叫愛德華茲醫生到這  馬上
Page Dr. Edwards here stat. Right away.

644
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:32,590
我需要做超聲檢查
I need an ultrasound.

645
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:34,510
你懷孕了  阿歷克斯知道嗎
Are you pregnant? Does Alex know?

646
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:36,440
不是  我只是需要一臺超聲儀
No, I-I need an ultrasound machine.

647
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,410
你見到愛德華茲嗎
Have you seen Edwards?

648
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,870
阿歷克斯以為我懷孕了么
Does Alex think I'm pregnant?

649
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,290
我有個和這一樣的馬克杯
I have a mug like that.

650
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,410
你去哪了
Where the hell have you been?

651
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:49,670
我以為你走了
Uh, I thought you were leaving,

652
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:50,790
而且我和楊醫生發現了一個
and Dr. Yang and I found

653
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,000
左腦室動靜脈畸形的病人
a left ventricle A.V.M.

654
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,730
那你現在在這了  進來手術吧
Yeah, well, you're here now. Scrub in.

655
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:54,780
我拒絕
I'd rather not.

656
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:58,060
肖恩  你得忘掉它
Shane, you gotta get past this.

657
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,650
讓你參與手術可不是為了安慰你
You're not a consolation prize.

658
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:00,890
而是你有真材實料
You deserve to be here.

659
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:03,890
布魯克斯的天賦...
Brooks had a gift that needed to be...

660
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:05,550
我不想和你共事
I don't wanna work with you.

661
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,580
我對這科沒興趣
I'm not interested.

662
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,200
我說得夠清楚了吧
Can I be more clear?

663
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,990
挺清楚了
I suppose not.

664
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:15,180
你走吧
Go.

665
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,780
時間才能見證療效
To a certain extent, time will tell.

666
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:26,820
現在我們確定的是你的心臟沒有受到損害
What we know for sure is we've done no damage to your heart,

667
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,510
而且在這種初期階段
and at this preliminary stage,

668
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:32,390
腦動靜脈畸形不會繼續發展
it appears the A.V.M. won't continue to grow.

669
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,830
那就是說
So you're saying...

670
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,060
我會活下去
I'll live?

671
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,180
是的
Yes.

672
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:39,700
我的天吶
Dear god.

673
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,760
-本  親愛的  -我懂
- Ben? Honey? - I know.

674
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,810
不會有事的
We'll be all right.

675
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:48,960
我知道花了太多錢  這一年太瘋狂了
I know it's a lot of money. It's been a crazy year,

676
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,150
但我的世界不能沒有你
but the world is a lot more fun with you in it.

677
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:55,410
只要我們倆在一起  一切都會沒事的
As long as we have each other, everything will be fine.

678
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:57,490
-喬伊斯  我們玩完了  -是的
- Joyce, we're screwed. - I know.

679
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,070
我們不只是破產  我們還是罪犯
We're not just bankrupt. We're criminals.

680
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,770
我們很可能會坐牢
I think we might go to jail.

681
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:02,220
我們簡直親手埋葬了自己
Oh, we're so incredibly screwed.

682
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,290
就像廉價妓女作踐自己一樣
Like a $2 whore.

683
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,920
楊  那是我的踝關節骨折病人
Yang, that's my broken ankle.

684
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,660
下次在偷我的病人之前
How about a little heads-up

685
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,560
知會我一聲好么
next time you wanna steal one of my patients?

686
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:16,290
他們怎么了
What happened to them?

687
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,470
我救了他
I saved his life.

688
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:24,610
我知道你救了他
So I get that you saved him,

689
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:27,490
但他是我的病人  你得提前跟我說
but he was my patient, and you should've told me before you...

690
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:29,680
我想出了治療方案  而你沒有  
I came up with the fix. You didn't.

691
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,930
如果你還因那晚的事而生氣
If you're still pissed about what happened the other night.

692
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,310
我   我在和杰克森交往
I... I'm with Jackson.

693
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:38,210
上次那事的確不該發生  也不會有下次
It was inappropriate, and it's not gonna happen again.

694
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:39,160
你在說什么
What are you talking about?

695
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,540
你親了我  肖恩
When you kissed me, Shane.

696
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:42,860
是那個啊
Oh. That.

697
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:46,110
我們那時很激動  所以就發生了
We were excited. It happened.

698
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:48,020
我很抱歉你想多了
I'm sorry it meant more to you--

699
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:50,810
-沒想多  -那你還說
- It didn't. - You're still talking about it.

700
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:53,510
你怎么回事啊
What's happened to you?

701
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,560
你倆在嘀咕啥
What are you guys whispering about?

702
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,940
-沒事  -天吶  你們  好吧
- Nothing. - God, you guys, fine.

703
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,380
是亞利桑那·羅賓斯
It's Arizona Robbins.

704
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,520
但別到處說好嗎
But please don't say anything, okay?

705
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,400
-因為她不想  -羅賓斯
- Because she really doesn't need...  - Robbins?

706
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,990
就是說  你現在是拉拉了
So... you're gay now?

707
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:06,430
肖恩  成熟點  這東西沒定性的
Shane, grow up. It's a sliding scale.

708
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:07,540
我只是對她有點好感而已
I slide over her way.

709
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,110
如果你見人就貼標簽
If you really have to label everything,

710
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,170
那就給我貼"熱戀中"
then label me "in love."

711
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:10,970
墨菲
Murphy!

712
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,050
很抱歉  他們猜得七七八八了
I'm sorry. They pretty much figured it out.

713
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:22,880
不  我才要道歉  因為我得跟你說實話了
No. I'm sorry, because I'm about to be very frank.

714
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:24,700
那晚我做了非常糟糕的決定
The other night was a bad call on my part.

715
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,180
我那時很孤獨  而且當時很愉悅
I was lonely, and it was... lovely.

716
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,720
但僅僅只是那一晚
But it was-- it was one night,

717
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,040
不會再有下一次
and that's all that it will ever be,

718
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,300
所以如果這和你預期不一樣
so if you had different expectations,

719
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,470
那就慢慢適應
please adjust them.

720
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:34,340
當然
Of course.

721
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,990
你不需要道歉  這是我的錯
There's no need to apologize. It's my fault.

722
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:40,480
我從不和別人深交
I don't open up to people much,

723
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:42,300
而只要和別人交往深入點
and when I try to open up a little bit,

724
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:45,000
我就會得意忘形  以前就有過
I can get carried away. It's happened before.

725
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:47,660
而你
And you...

726
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:51,590
我一直很欣賞作為外科醫生的你
I've just always admired you as... a surgeon,

727
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:53,050
還有你這個人
and--and a person,

728
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,270
所以我以為你有那個意思
and the thought that you thought about me...

729
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,560
我卻誤解了
I misunderstood.

730
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,570
我想過頭了  很抱歉
Um, I went overboard, and I'm sorry.

731
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:02,680
不會有下次
It won't happen again.

732
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:05,860
莉亞
Leah...

733
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,050
謝謝你的理解
Thank you for understanding.

734
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:17,350
杜松子酒  加冰
Gin, rocks.

735
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,400
你不會要我買單吧
You gonna charge me again?

736
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:21,380
別的酒吧對樂隊都免費啦
Most places comp the bands, you know?

737
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,320
這杯我請
I got this one.

738
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:25,500
謝謝
Appreciate that.

739
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,320
吉米·埃文斯
Jimmy Evans.

740
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:28,880
你好
Hey.

741
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,350
我認識你
I know you.

742
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:37,520
我這幾天一直有來
I've, uh, been here the last couple of nights.

743
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,880
不  我不是說這個
No. Something else.

744
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,530
天吶
Oh, my god.

745
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:49,550
你是醫院里的
You're a doctor...

746
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,090
醫生
at the hospital.

747
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:52,580
被你發現了
Guilty.

748
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,110
你每晚都來這干嘛
What brings you back here every night?

749
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:58,550
聽你彈奏  我喜歡你的歌
Oh, uh, you. I mean, I like your set.

750
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,860
其實我是喜歡艾伯特·柯林斯的歌
Uh, I like the Albert Collins stuff.

751
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,860
美國布魯斯吉他大師

752
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:02,970
耳力不錯嘛  你會彈嗎
Ah. You got a good ear, then. You play?

753
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,870
小時候我爸教過我一點
My dad taught me a little when I was a kid,

754
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,670
但他后來沒繼續教我了
but, uh, he didn't stick with it.

755
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,260
那你應該堅持去自學
Aw, you should have stuck with it.

756
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,770
彈吉他能給你帶來很多東西
Look where it could've taken you.

757
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,270
雖說不能當醫生救死扶傷
I mean, instead of saving people's lives,

758
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,140
但你可以來這給四個聽眾
you could be playing 70-year-old songs

759
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:16,660
演奏首懷舊老歌
to four people in a giant ashtray.

760
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,140
你是哪方面的醫生
What kind of doctor are you?

761
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,000
小兒科醫生
Pediatric surgeon.

762
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:29,160
嬰兒  小孩
Babies, kids.

763
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:31,230
我這輩子見過兒科醫生一次
I met a pediatric surgeon once.

764
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,990
我人生中最恐怖的一晚
Scariest night of my life.

765
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:36,350
我兒子兩歲都不到
My son's not even 2 years old.

766
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,340
我給他吃草莓  他噎著了
I'm feeding him strawberries, and he starts choking.

767
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,660
臉色發紫
Turned blue.

768
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,570
趕緊送他去醫院  醫生把他救活了
We take him in, they get him breathing again.

769
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:47,820
兒科醫生給他插管
Pediatric surgeon runs the tube down his throat,

770
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,070
把噎著他的東西取出
and got the thing out.

771
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:52,940
救了我兒子  也救了我
Saved my boy's life. Saved my life, too.

772
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,250
如果那晚我兒子死了
If I'd lost my little boy that night,

773
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:58,430
我估計也活不下去了
I never would've made it. I never would've survived.

774
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,580
幸好沒事啊
I'm glad it worked out for you.

775
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:06,970
是啊  真心得感謝你們兒科醫生啊
Yeah. Thank god for you guys, man. Seriously.

776
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:09,890
你兒子在哪
So where is he?

777
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:12,420
你家人呢
Now, I mean. Where's your family?

778
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,700
這個問題很復雜
That's a complicated answer.

779
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:19,830
這酒吧都沒什么人了
This place has really cleared out.

780
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,300
看來我真有"魅力"啊
I guess I was the big draw.

781
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:24,900
是的啊
Yeah, well...

782
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,900
我也該走了
I probably should head out myself.

783
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,650
你會彈吉他嗎
I was gonna say, you play a little?

784
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:30,630
我多出一把吉他
I got an extra guitar.

785
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:32,000
我們可以一起彈啊
We can get up and make some noise.

786
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,630
不了  我就小時候彈過  之后就沒彈了
No. No, I haven't played since I was a kid.

787
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:36,480
反正沒人聽  彈不好也沒關系
Well, there's no one here to hear you suck.

788
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,090
一起啊  很好玩的
Come on. It'll be fun.

789
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:40,570
我什么曲子都不懂
I don't know any songs.

790
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,660
還記得你爸爸教你彈的曲子嗎
What about the songs your daddy taught you?

791
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:45,340
我可能會彈
I might know one of those.

792
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:50,950
是不是心律有變化
Am I hearing changes in his rhythm?

793
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,560
請打開心臟檢測儀
Turn up the heart monitor, please.

794
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,380
開了
Done.

795
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:57,420
增加甘露醇劑量
More mannitol.

796
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,940
心律混亂  血壓上升
Rhythm's getting very erratic, and--and B.P.'s rising.

797
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,720
安靜
Quiet. Quiet.

798
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:12,890
好  先停下手術
All right. Reverse the paralytics.

799
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:15,350
檢查嘔吐反射
All right, let me check his gag reflexes.

800
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:22,660
不要啊  米基  加把勁
Oh, no, Mickey. Come on. No.

801
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:26,610
謝博德醫生  沒有任何腦活動
Dr. Shepherd, there's no brain activity.

802
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,560
那是
That is a...

803
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:48,410
胰腺假性囊腫  萬歲
pancreatic pseudocyst! Bam!

804
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,750
你剛才高呼”萬歲”了
Did you just say "bam"?

805
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,800
這是牽涉性疼痛吧
It had to be referred pain, right?

806
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:55,530
但肩部牽涉性疼痛
But referred pain to the shoulder

807
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,970
是隔膜刺激的癥狀
means irritation of the diaphragm,

808
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:59,570
這看似不合理  但是
which did not make sense, but...

809
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:01,440
你有胰液外漏
you have pancreatic fluid leakage,

810
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,950
所以我在想  
so I was thinking, well, maybe something

811
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:05,340
也許是有什么刺激到隔膜
was aggravating the diaphragm,

812
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,920
導致肩部牽涉性疼痛
which referred to the shoulder,

813
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,380
然后  萬歲
And bam!

814
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:10,880
胰腺假性囊腫
Pancreatic pseudocyst.

815
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:13,320
也許在告知病人的時候
Maybe you should wipe that smile off your face

816
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,900
不要笑得這么開心
before you tell the patient.

817
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:18,610
天啊  抱歉
Oh, god. I am so sorry.

818
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:20,970
我忘記這不是個好消息
I-I forgot that this is bad news.

819
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:23,920
那你為什么笑啊
And... you're laughing.

820
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:27,320
這是我首次覺得  你讓我放心了
For the first time today, I feel like I'm in good hands.

821
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,150
干得好  威爾遜
Nice work, Wilson.

822
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,250
你找到病源了
You traced it back to the source.

823
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,860
我準備接手我媽媽的研究
Hey! I'm doing my mother's research,

824
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,880
但不是你說的那個原因哦
but not for the reasons you said I should.

825
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,150
-別鬧  格蕾  -是因為她的想法很好
- Not now, Grey. - She had a good idea!

826
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:54,320
我不是沾她的光  我是延續她的熱情
I'm not riding her coattails. I am sharing her passion.

827
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,560
或許這就是我母親留給我的
Maybe this is what my mother gave me.

828
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,690
你爸把你教的不錯啊
Your daddy taught you pretty good.

829
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,210
向前走*
*Go ahead

830
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,290
親愛的孩子*
*Pretty baby

831
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:09,430
向前走  享受人生*
*Go ahead, knock yourself out

832
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,030
我一直愛著你  寶貝*
*I still love you, baby

833
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:17,010
你是如此純潔無暇*
*'Cause you don't know what it's all about

834
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:22,550
明亮燈光*
*Bright lights

835
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,260
大都市*
*Big city

836
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:30,510
都讓孩子眼花繚亂*
*Gone to my baby's head

837
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,770
明亮燈光*
*Bright lights

838
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,430
大都市*
*Big city

839
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:39,920
沒事吧
You okay?

840
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:45,100
這首歌真不錯
You know... that's a good tune.

841
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:46,210
讓我想起很多以前的事
Brings back a lot.

842
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:49,070
如果你不提醒自己
You know, if you're not careful,

843
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:51,280
以前犯下的錯誤就會很困擾你
all your old mistakes can just roll up on you.

844
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:55,900
我也教我的孩子彈吉他
I taught my kid to play guitar, too.

845
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,700
就像你說的
It's like you said.

846
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:00,870
我多希望我當時堅持下去
I wish I'd had stuck with it.

847
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:04,390
也許你孩子堅持彈吉他了
Well, your kid probably does, too.

848
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,550
但時光無法倒流  是吧
Yeah, but there's no going back, is there?

849
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,410
你想看看他的照片嗎
Can I show you a picture of him?

850
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,430
我兒子
My boy?

851
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,460
你有他的照片啊
What, you have one?

852
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:28,700
這是尼基
That's Nicky.

853
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:32,990
他那時五歲  現在差不多十二歲了
He's 5 there. He'd be about 12 now.

854
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,440
旁邊那位是他媽媽娜奧米
And, uh, that's his mom, Naomi.

855
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:36,930
她是日本人
She's Japanese.

856
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:39,400
這是
Who's...

857
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,750
他們現在在哪
Where are they?

858
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:43,700
南佛羅里達州
South Florida.

859
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:46,660
我很久沒有回去了
I haven't been back there in years.

860
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,810
天啊  你真是死性不改啊
God, you just keep doing this.

861
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,460
什么意思
What do you mean?

862
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:54,480
放過這個孩子  永遠都別回去
Do this kid a favor. Don't ever go back.

863
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:55,760
讓他好好長大
Let him grow up

864
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,990
不要讓他知道你是個爛人
without knowing you any more that he already has.

865
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,080
搞什么啊 
What the hell, man?

866
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:01,760
這樣對他比較好  你知道的
He's better off. You know that.

867
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,010
你怎么了啊
What's your problem?

868
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,820
剛才還好好的
We were having fun here.

869
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:11,110
我是在保護你兒子  你兒子沒你更好
I'm trying to protect your kid. You're no good to him.

870
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:14,500
你不了解我  也輪不到你來說我兒子
Hey, you don't know me, and you don't talk about my kid.

871
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,080
別動手
Hey! no!

872
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:18,830
滾
Out!

873
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,200
給我滾
You, out, now!

874
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:32,430
這樣對大家再好不過了
This way, you can do the most good for the most people.

875
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,330
你真這樣認為
You think so?

876
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:36,050
他會很欣慰的
He would be grateful.

877
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:38,080
你所做的正是他希望的
You did exactly what he wanted.

878
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:43,410
我不會退出這個項目
I'm not dropping the project.

879
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,710
你是對的
You were right.

880
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,230
我開始是為了她
I was doing it for her.

881
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:50,080
現在我要為造福他人完成它
And now I will do it for a million people

882
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,450
即使我見不到他們
I'll never even meet.

883
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:53,620
也是為了米基
And for Mickey.

884
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,250
我非常需要你的幫助
I could really use your help.

885
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,960
我們才剛剛有點了解
We were just starting to learn

886
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,230
大腦神經連接之廣袤
the extent of the brain's connections...

887
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,930
連接之遠  連接之深
How far they reach, how deep they go.

888
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,430
我已經不知道該怎么說我自己了
I think I've ceased to exist.

889
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,940
我今天創造了歷史  實話實說
I made history today, literally.

890
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:38,640
給無法手術的病人手術  
Operated on the inoperable,

891
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,370
把病人從死亡中拯救出來
saved a man from certain death,

892
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,620
但卻毀了他的生活
and then ruined his life.

893
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:45,230
還有  歐文
Oh, also Owen

894
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:49,610
好像跟那個叫瑪琳的處得很好
seems very happy with that Marling person

895
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:52,490
而他卻從沒跟她提起過我
to whom he has never even mentioned me.

896
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:56,950
就好像過去幾年什么事都沒發生過一樣
It's as if the last few years never happened.

897
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,970
還有  賣紙巾的自動售貨機
Also, the automatic paper towel thingy

898
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:02,660
認不出我是個人類
won't recognize me as human.

899
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,320
我就站在那  像個傻子一樣揮著手
I'm just standing there, waving my hands like an idiot.

900
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:07,110
對不起  你說什么
I'm sorry. What?

901
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,170
你在干什么
What are you doing?

902
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:13,500
申請研究基金
Application for research funding.

903
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,980
你選好項目了
Oh, you picked your project.

904
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,630
我要做3D打印的門靜脈
I'm gonna 3-D print portal veins.

905
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,630
這太棒了  梅
That is amazing, Mer.

906
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,820
-你打算如何  -好了  別說了
- How are you gonna do that-- - Okay, don't.

907
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:24,860
所以我才沒有告訴你
It's why I didn't tell you.

908
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:26,900
我有一份事業和一個家庭  
I have a career and a family,

909
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,040
我決定要同時照顧兩方面
and I'm going to do both.

910
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:30,640
我沒有時間聽你說我做不來什么
What I don't have time for is for you to tell me that I can't.

911
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,590
我從沒說過這種話
I never said that.

912
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:33,190
你知道  我一直支持你
You know, I was always there for you,

913
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:34,800
無論你想要什么
for whatever you needed.

914
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,940
現在要你來支持我了
And now this is when I need you,

915
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,980
你應該來幫我
and you're supposed to help me.

916
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:42,620
然而相反地  上周你把我推到一邊
And instead, last week you pushed me aside

917
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:44,280
就因為我有了孩子
because I had a baby.

918
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,560
你是現在沒時間考慮我嗎
You don't have time for me now?

919
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,820
是你從來就不想
Because you don't have time

920
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:50,940
為了那些和你追求不一樣的人付出
for people who want things that you don't want.

921
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:55,790
但我們知道所有的連接都很重要
But we know that every connection matters.

922
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,470
每一個連接都很關鍵
Every connection is crucial.

923
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,740
我  我還得把這做完
I-I-I have to finish this.

924
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,420
如果有一個斷開了
And when one is broken...

925
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,800
那通常說明某處已有損傷
It usually means some damage has been done.

926
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:14,980
我不知道是你有了別人
I can't figure it out if you're seeing someone else

927
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,440
還是你覺得我懷孕了
or you think that you knocked me up,

928
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,060
所以  
So...

929
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:20,740
我試著回想問題究竟出在哪
I tried to trace it back to the root of the problem,

930
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:21,900
然后我認為是因為你爸爸
and I think it's your dad.

931
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:22,760
聽著  我告訴過你
Look, I told you--

932
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:23,930
別再提起這事  我知道
Not to bring it up again, I know,

933
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:26,270
但這是最后一次  因為如果我搞錯了
and this is the last time, because if I'm wrong--

934
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:28,890
你沒錯  你應該為自己感到驕傲
You're not wrong. You should be proud of yourself.

935
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:30,370
我本該不去招惹他
I could've let him just pass through,

936
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:32,090
但你卻總說什么"和他談談
but you were all "talk to him,

937
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:33,820
不然你后半輩子肯定要后悔"
you'll wonder for the rest of your life."

938
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:34,800
很好  謝謝  
Well, thanks.

939
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:36,440
十八年前跟他鬧翻時  我以為
I didn't know I could feel this crappy again

940
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,330
我再也不會那樣生氣了
after 18 frickin' years!

941
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:46,200
這種連接的系統驅使我們行動
This system of connections compels us to act

942
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,820
作出選擇以及如何表現
and choose and behave...

943
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:55,940
有時似乎違背了我們的本意的
Sometimes seemingly against our own will.

944
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:58,970
短信
莉亞·墨菲

945
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:07,400
你在干什么呢

946
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:14,230
你在干什么呢
發送

947
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,040
但并不是無章可循的
But it is not random at all.

948
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,320
它是我們之所以成為我們的藍圖
It is the map of who we are.

949
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:24,020
你收到我的短信了嗎
Did you get my text?

950
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:26,820
對不起  我有事耽擱了
Sorry. I was stuck there.

951
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,440
我必須今晚把那做好
I had to get this thing out by tonight.

952
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,480
我也有點事情
I got hung up, too.

953
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,940
我剛剛把他們哄睡著
I just barely got them down.

954
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:32,540
-剛剛  -我知道
- Just now? - I know.

955
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:33,250
這么晚
It's so late.

956
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:35,300
我知道  我盡力了
I know. I tried.

957
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:38,910
這樣下去不行
It's not working.

958
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,610
對  不行
No, it isn't.

959
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:44,760
我們沒法又忙工作又忙孩子
We just can't seem to make the pieces fit.

960
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,080
我同意  但我不知道還能怎樣
I agree, but I don't know how--

961
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,050
我有辦法
I think I do.

962
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,920
我想多花點時間在BCI研究上
I wanna spend more time on this B.C.I. research.

963
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:52,720
B.C.I.  基于運動想象的腦機接口

964
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,330
托瑞斯和我  今天開了個好頭
Torres and I... blew it wide open today.

965
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:57,490
-所以你想花更多時間工作  -不
- So you wanna take on more? - No.

966
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,260
其實是更少
Less, actually.

967
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,130
今年對你來說很重要
This is a big year for you,

968
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:03,710
你得花時間搞好自己的工作
and you need time to make it work.

969
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,060
我已經經歷過了  我可以先退回來
I had a big year. I can step back,

970
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,260
少做點手術  專心做科研
scale down the surgery, focus on this research,

971
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,640
多花時間陪孩子
spend time with the kids,

972
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:13,610
給你更多時間
and give you the slack you need

973
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:15,200
把這一年過得充實
to make this year count.

974
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:18,420
我不喜歡
I don't like it.

975
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:19,560
-什  -你會恨我的
- Wh-- - You'll resent me,

976
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,610
孩子們也會恨我的
and so will the kids,

977
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:23,160
而且  我不想變成我母親那樣
and... I don't wanna be my mother.

978
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:26,810
你不是你母親  你知道的
You're not your mother. You know that.

979
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,290
我們會繼續努力試著理解我們自己
We will work to understand ourselves...

980
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,540
解開這個謎團
Solve the puzzle...

981
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:33,670
這不公平
It feels unfair.

982
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:36,200
跟孩子們在一起又不是什么稱心的獎勵
Spending time with the kids is not a consolation prize.

983
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:37,850
這就是獎勵
It is the prize.

984
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,020
你要公平嗎  也許以后
You want fair? Maybe down the road,

985
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,630
我會讓你跟他們在一起過一年
I'll give you a year with them.

986
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:43,460
也許等佐拉開始出去約會的
Maybe when Zola's dating,

987
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,070
因為我可不想那會兒成天在她身邊攪局
'cause I don't wanna be around for that.

988
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:51,360
我愛你
I love you.

989
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,280
你可是該愛我  我為你做了多大的犧牲啊
Well, you should. What I'm doing is amazing for you.

990
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:01,460
你的日子會比我的更有趣
You're gonna have more fun than me.

991
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:04,200
我知道  原來杯子在這
I know. Oh, so that's where that went.

992
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:05,810
是啊  這是我們的嗎
Yeah. Is that ours?

993
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:06,530
是的
Yes.

994
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:08,490
這些連接是如何工作的
how all the connections work

995
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:12,570
以及零碎的片段是如何
and all the pieces...

996
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,290
完美結合的
fit.
