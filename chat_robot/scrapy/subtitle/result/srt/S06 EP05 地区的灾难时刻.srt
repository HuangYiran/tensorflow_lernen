1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,190
上溯至宇宙初始  周遭还只是一片漆黑
In the beginning, there was darkness.

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:03,800
不知何时  忽地一声巨响  
And then-- Bang!

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,980
时间空间以及物质皆由此发端
Giving birth to an endless expanding existence

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,060
此后不断膨胀  延伸  永无止境
of time, space, and matter.

5
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:12,060
每一天  新的发现都在不断为我们解开 
Every day, new discoveries are unlocking

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,010
蕴藏于这里的那些神秘莫测  
the mysterious, the mind-blowing,

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,880
令人大开眼界  致命的秘密 
the deadly secrets of a place we call

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,180
我们称这个地方为"宇宙"
the universe.

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,730
在其40多亿年的存在时间里
Throughout its more than 4 billion years of existence,

10
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,400
地球经历了一些极其险恶的状况
planet Earth has endured some extremely rough days,

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,510
但是最险恶的是什么呢
but what were the very worst?

12
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:38,050
是和相距过近的行星发生碰撞吗
Was it a shadowing encounter with a planet that got too close?

13
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,980
不管当时有什么  肯定也都灰飞烟灭了
Had anything been there, it definitely wouldn't have survived.

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,720
还是炽热的致命射线
Or a hot shower of deadly rays

15
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,490
几乎把地球上的生命扫荡一空 
that almost scoured the planet clean of life?

16
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:51,920
后续的热浪涌向四面八方
The blast from the impact would have laid waves

17
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,570
辐射范围达到数千公里
to thousand miles in every direction.

18
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,670
可以算得上是全球范围的声波
It's literally the sound waves around the world.

19
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:59,620
从摧毁一切的失控火山活动
From runaway volcanism that led to vast extinctions

20
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,710
到引发了全球深度冻结的微生物
to tiny microbes that triggered a global deep freeze.

21
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,910
生命在灭绝的边缘  摇摇欲坠
Life is teetered perilously close to the break,

22
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:08,700
一次又一次
time and time again.

23
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,750
此次生物灭绝数量之多  可能空前绝后
More life died then, than any time since and maybe any time before.

24
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,180
这是史上范围最广程度最惨烈的灭绝
This was the biggest and the baddest of them all.

25
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:21,360
最黑暗的时候已过去  还是潜伏在未来
Are the darkest hours behind us or lurking in the distant future?

26
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:28,530
做好准备  我们要倒数地球的七次灾难了
Take cover as we count down the seven worst days on planet Earth.

27
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,570
宇                   宙

28
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,570
地 球 的 灾 难 时 刻

35
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:48,790
也许你认为你经历过一些困难的时刻
You may think you've had some really rough days

36
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,360
比如严重的堵车
stuck in gridlock traffic,

37
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:56,260
上班途中人山人海
dodging the sea of humanity on their way to work

38
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,840
遭遇一场暴雨或暴风雪
or trapped in a torrential down pour or blizzard.

39
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:04,250
但是这些情况跟地球的七次灾难相比
But they can't even begin to compare

40
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,620
完全就是小巫见大巫
to the seven worst days on planet Earth.

41
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,840
纵观历史  地球遭遇过一些极其恶劣的情况
Throughout its history earth has experienced some really bad days,

42
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,400
灭绝生命的  创造生命的
days that have killed off life, created life,

43
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,480
以及重塑整个地球的
restructured the planet as a whole.

44
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:20,840
所有这些才形成了现今的地球
All of this together has formed the Earth that we live on today,

迈克尔・密史纳
美国宇航局  喷气推进实验所

46
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,210
但是那些时期
but during those really bad days

47
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:27,130
我们绝对不想去经历
we certainly wouldn't want to be here.

48
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,980
在我们看来
From our point of view,

49
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,690
地球确实经历过一些灾难时期
Earth has been through some pretty rough days.

50
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:36,490
灾难性的冲击极大地改变了地貌
Catastrophic impacts that have really changed the face of the planet

劳拉・丹莉
格里菲斯天文台

52
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,880
改变了植物群和动物群
and changed the makeup of the flora and fauna,

53
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,150
即地球上所有动植物
the animals and plants on the planet.

54
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,580
灾难时刻之一发生在地球的早期
One of Earth's worst days came early in its history

55
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,010
一颗飞来横星猛冲而来
when an uninvited guest barged into our neighborhood

56
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:55,320
在生命出现之际便将其扼杀在摇篮中
and threatened to destroy the planet before life had a chance to blossom.

57
00:03:00,280 --> 00:02:57,500
忒伊亚星撞击

58
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,660
现在我们就来探索地球第七大灾难时刻
Let's dig in as the 7th worst day on Earth...

59
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,210
忒伊亚星撞击
The Theia impact.

60
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,480
大约在45亿年前
About 4.5 billion years ago

61
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,430
我们的太阳系是一片战场
our solar system was a battle zone.

62
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:23,050
巨砾相互碰撞  融合  形成行星
Giant boulders collided and coalesced to form planets.

63
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:29,620
早期的地球在灼烧形成之后不断遭到袭击
Infant Earth took hit after searing hit.

64
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,900
如果我们有时光机
If we could somehow magically transport ourselves

65
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,790
回到早期的地球时期
back in time to be in the time to be on the early Earth

66
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:34,860
我认为那会非常有意思
it'd be very interesting, I think,

67
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,110
能够亲眼看看那些大事件
to watch one of these large impact events.

68
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,410
地球表面
The surface of the Earth itself

69
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:42,090
炽热到接近熔点
was probably heated to a nearly molten state.

70
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,160
大气层布满灰尘
The atmosphere would be very dusty,

71
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,630
十分炎热
you'd be very hot.

72
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:46,280
那是一个我们完全陌生的环境
So, it would be a very alien world to us

73
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,970
丹・杜尔达
西南研究所

74
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,750
人类不可能生存
one that we couldn't actually survive on

75
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,220
不能像现在这样站在这里
just standing like we are here today.

76
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,050
石块不断撞击  
Pounding by incoming rocks,

77
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:58,300
地球逐渐增至近似现在的体积
Earth slowly grew to nearly its present size.

78
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,780
有一个坚硬的地壳
Developing a solid crust,

79
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,140
厚实的地幔
a thick mantel,

80
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,850
铁质地核
an iron core

81
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:06,710
和炎热的大气层
and a hot stormy atmosphere.

82
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:11,140
有些人推测那时的生命非常脆弱
Some speculate that life may have taken a tenuous hold

83
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:14,210
但之后  就是灾难
but then disaster.

84
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,530
邻近一颗叫忒伊亚的行星
A neighboring planet named Theia

85
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:20,440
试图挤入地球的公转轨道
had been edging into Earth's orbital path.

86
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,450
此次入侵以最具灾难性的形式结束
The intrusion ended in the most disastrous way imaginable...

87
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,290
世界大碰撞
A collision of worlds.

88
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,000
这是一次十分惨烈的事件
It was a very violent event.

89
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,260
想象一下  火星质量的物体  
Imagine something the mass of Mars,

90
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:35,090
即地球质量的一成
about 10% the mass of the Earth

91
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:33,520
唐・布朗李
华盛顿大学

92
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,970
从太空飞奔而来
whacking in from space

93
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,570
将自己撞得粉身碎骨
and blowing all its material.

94
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,560
那时地球表面的所有物体 
Whatever was on the Earth at that time,

95
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,140
都因这次事件面目全非
it was radically changed by this event.

96
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,570
当火星那么大的行星撞击地球
When a Mars size object whacked in to the Earth,

97

亚历克斯・菲利彭科
加利福尼亚大学伯克利分校

98
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,910
这可是地球的灾难日
that was a bad day on Earth.

99
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:56,190
不管当时有什么  肯定也都灰飞烟灭了
Had anything been there, it definitely wouldn't have survived.

100
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:02,260
整个灾难历时数小时
It took hours for the full scope of the catastrophe to unfold.

101
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:05,430
随着两颗星球内核的融化
As the cores of the two planets melted,

102
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:08,550
地球的大气层物质被撞击飞向太空
Earth's atmosphere was blasted into space.

103
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:14,350
在超过一千摄氏度的高温下  地壳融化
Its crust liquified at over 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit,

104
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:19,450
地球和忒伊亚星地幔的大部分
and vast portions of both Earth's and Theia's mantels,

105
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,700
被抛射进入轨道
were rejected into orbit.

106
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,810
这跟电影里演的不一样
It's not at all like what you see in the movies.

107
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:27,750
你可以坐下喝上一杯咖啡
You could sit down and have a cup of coffee

108
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,310
发现还没撞完
and it's still going on!

109
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,600
大块物体撞击得花费很长时间
These, like you know, big objects take a long time to incur,

110
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,870
子弹打穿墙体那种火光可比不了这个
so these aren't the normal flashes you'd think about bullets hitting a wall.

111
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:43,340
这些喷射出的物质形成了一条巨大的轨道环
The bloom of ejected material created a vast orbital ring

112
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,900
之后逐渐融合为地球的新伙伴
before coalescing into a new companion for the Earth.

113
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,550
这就是新生的月球
The new born, Moon.

114
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,550
那颗成熟的星球和地球合为一体
That fully fledged planet merged with the Earth.

115
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,700
两颗星内部铁质内核融合
The iron cores would have come together,

116
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:00,070
含硅的地幔物质留在地球表面
and their silicon mantels were left on the Earth

117
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:04,760
并且形成了环绕地球的碟状带
and also it created into a disc that was orbiting the Earth.

118
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:07,280
这个碟状带的大部分物质撞击回地球  
This disc most of it came back and crashed back on to the Earth

120
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,330
但有一部分
but then a portion of it

121
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,470
重新组合  逐渐被越推越远
reformed and over time has been pushed out

122
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,970
最后形成了月球
and it's become the Moon.

123
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:23,180
足足过了1.5亿年  地球形态才稳定下来
It took about 150 million years for Earth to stabilize

124
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,910
融化的地壳逐渐冷却凝固
and its molten crust to reharden.

125
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:30,460
尽管忒伊亚星撞击对地球来说是灾难
But although the Theia impact was a very bad day on Earth,

126
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:36,170
但有助于地球形成适宜生命存在的条件
it was a very good day for its ability to sustain life.

127
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,900
月球形成后  地球的自转轴稳定了
When the Moon formed, it stabilized Earth's axis of rotation

128
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,420
否则来自其他星球的重力牵引
otherwise gravitational tugs from other planets

129
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,910
将导致地球混乱无序地变动
would have caused it to chaotically vary

130
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:51,150
而这样就会对严重破坏长期气候稳定
and that would have been bad for a long-term climate stability.

131
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,860
如果这种影响没有产生
Would we even have life as we know it

132
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,910
地球上能否有生命存在呢
if that impact had not taken place?

133
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:01,330
如果没有月亮  那么热带地区
Without a moon, you could really have a case with your tropics

134

彼得・沃德
华盛顿大学教授

135
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:05,550
在经过几百万年后  可能会转过来
within hundreds of thousands of years, could rotate

136
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,470
变成像两极地区
and become the Arctic or the Antarctic

137
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,910
这样所有生物就会死亡
and you kill everything.

138
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,810
当冲击结束后
With the impact over,

139
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:17,810
月球提供了轨道稳定性
and the Moon now providing orbital stability

140
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,390
地球的情况貌似安稳下来了
the stage seems set for a quiet future.

141
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,200
但事与愿违
But that was not to be.

142
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:28,230
行星形成  月球形成  皆大欢喜
You formed the planets, you formed the Moon, everyone's happy

143
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,760
但是突然间可怕的事情就发生了
and all of a sudden something terrible happens.

144
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,970
地球又一次的被卷入到一场浩劫中
Earth was suddenly caught in the cross fire once again.

145
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,360
第六大地球灾难时刻
Number six on our countdown of worst days...

146
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:43,330
太阳系后期重轰炸期

147
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,210
太阳系后期重轰炸期
The Late Heavy Bombardment.

148
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,910
在忒伊亚撞击过去约一亿五千万年后
Approximately 150 million years after the Theia impact,

149
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,350
地壳冷却了
the Earth's crust cooled.

150
00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:01,330
一些人推测  早期大洋甚至生命或已形成
Some speculate that early oceans and even life may have evolved.

151
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,710
但另一场大灾难将把这一切切摧毁殆尽
But another cataclysm would wipe the slate clean.

152
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,920
在太阳系的边缘
In the far reaches of the Solar System

153
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,910
外太阳系的巨大气体行星轨道开始波动
the orbit of the outer gas giants began to fluctuate

154
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:18,870
干扰了大量的彗星以及小行星
disrupting vast swarms of asteroids and comets.

155
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:22,560
数兆颗小行星脱离了原始轨道
Trillions broke loose from their orbits

156
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,370
并且朝着一颗布满岩石的行星冲来
and plunged inward towards the rocky planets,

157
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,710
开始了一段炙热的毁灭浩劫
launching an era of fiery destruction

158
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,590
也就是我们所知的后期重轰炸期
known as the late heavy bombardment.

159
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:38,340
我们知道有德州大小的陨石撞上地球
We know asteroids of the size of Texas hit the Earth.

160
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:43,260
任何该体积的陨石撞击都会导致大洋的消失
Any impact that big causes the entire ocean to go away.

161
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,630
地球一次又一次的变成不毛之地
We sterilize the Earth over and over and over

162
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:54,190
所以我们推断  地球上的生命不断进化
so the inference we have is that life evolved over and over and over

163
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:58,120
但是总是被这些陨石冲击所摧毁
just to be snuffed down again by these large impacts.

164
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:03,410
无休止的陨石轰炸形成了
The relentless bombardment gouged down craters

165
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,290
数千英里宽的环形山
thousands of miles wide

166
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:11,040
而这些陨石冲击持续了至少两亿年之久
and the hits just kept coming for at least 200 million years.

167
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:19,980
今日  历经数十亿年的侵蚀和板块运动
Today, billions of years of erosion and shifting plaque tectonics

168
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,160
当年那些陨石冲击的痕迹已经消失
have erased any trace of the cataclysm from the Earth's surface.

169
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:32,920
但在月球上的环形山就不一样了
But it is a different story on the crater face of the Moon.

170
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:41,330
我们可以很清楚的看到月球表面上的痕迹
We can see very clearly its record on the face of the Moon.

171
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:45,900
熔岩区就是在这次巨大冲击下形成的
The lava field basins were formed during the giant impact events

172
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,410
也就是在地球的后期重轰炸期
that occurred during the late heavy bombardment

173
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:52,930
所以我们便知在这期间有大型物体撞击地球
and so we know that large objects hit the Earth during this time.

174
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,250
但是这些天国的怒火
But this celestial reign of fire

175
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,700
或许还带来了希望之光[银光]
may have had a silver lining.

176
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:01,450
确实如此
Literally.

177
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:05,220
最新证据表明  在后期重轰炸期
New evidence suggests the late heavy bombardment

178
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,410
给地球表面带来的贵金属
delivered precious metals to the surface of Earth.

179
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:13,200
例如  银  金和铂
Things like silver, gold and platinum.

180
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,960
地球上原先的这些贵金属
Earth's original store these elements

181
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:22,720
随着地球慢慢变冷  已沉入地心铁核 
had sunken in its molten iron core as the planet slowly cooled.

182
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:27,140
但是现在地球表面早已固化
But now with the planet already solidified,

183
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:31,290
这种贵金属仍贮藏在地表
this new supply of materials remain near the surface

184
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,690
未来人类可进行开采
able to be mined by future humans.

185
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,160
我们今天的科技极其依赖这些重金属
Today's technologies depend on a lot of the heavy elements that

186
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,100
是通过陨石/彗星撞击地球而得来的
were delivered to the Earth through impacts.

187
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:46,660
所以  这也许对地球上的生命是个灾难
So, it may have been very difficult for the life,

188
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,470
如果在重轰炸期有生命存在的话
if there were life on Earth during the heavy bombardment

189
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,310
但是这对地壳却是件好事
but it was very good for the Earth's crust

190
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:55,420
因为它们的冲击给地表带来了
to have all these materials that we now depend on

191
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,470
这些我们赖以生存的材料
delivered to the surface of Earth through impacts.

192
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:05,550
后期重轰炸期实乃对地球火的洗礼
The late heavy bombardment was Earth's true baptism by fire.

193
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:12,410
但是现在该轮到第五大地球灾难时刻了
But now as we reach number five on our countdown of our planet's worst days,

194
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:16,260
地球经历了有史以来最严寒的时期
Earth catches the worst cold in history.

195
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,750
一场极寒的气候危机
A climatic crisis so chilling

196
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:24,610
让地球上的生命差点冻结在进化历程上
that life itself was in danger of being frozen in its tracks.

197
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:35,920
忒伊亚大冲击和后期重轰炸期
Both the Theia impact and the late heavy bombardment

198
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,590
都让地球变成了一片火海
turned Earth into an inferno.

199
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,560
现在继续倒数  地球七大灾难时刻
But now as we continue our countdown of the 7 worst days on Earth

200
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,590
我们回到从前
we escape forward in time

201
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:52,850
到达不是炙热而是极寒的灾难时期
to a catastrophe not of fire, but of all encompassing ice.

202
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,940
第五大灾难时刻
Number five on our countdown.

203
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:58,280
"雪地球"

204
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:02,700
也就是被称为"雪地球"的冰冻灾难期
The frozen cataclysm known as Snowball Earth.

205
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,080
地球曾经历过一些灾难日  
We had these bad days

206
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,300
但雪地球期可远远不止一天
and snowball Earth is much longer than a bad day.

207
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,320
它是长达数十万年的灾难
It's a bad hundreds of thousands of years.

208
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,780
雪地球期使整个行星变成了一个大雪地球
Snowball Earth is that the planet, it goes all snowball.

209
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:21,230
彼得・沃德
华盛顿大学教授

210
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,140
它让地球冷到整个大洋都冻住了
It cools enough that the oceans freeze,

211
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:24,930
大洋的冰层厚达三  六  十五米
down to 10 ft., 20, 50 ft. thick...

212
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,430
想象一下我们现在看到的北冰洋就知道了
Imagine the Arctic Sea ice we see now,

213
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,280
只不过当时整个地球都是如此
except the whole planet has that.

214
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:34,390
在一般的冰河期中  冰川会入侵温带
During a typical ice age, glaciers invade the temperate zones

215
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:38,720
最远至现在纽约和巴黎的位置
often reaching as far south as modern New York or Paris.

216
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:43,880
但在雪地球期  冰川仍锐势不减
But during Snowball Earth, the glaciers just kept coming

217
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,680
直到包围了整个地球
until they had encircled the entire planet

218
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,080
并且将海洋的冰层厚度扩大到1.6千米
and frozen the oceans to a depth above to a mile.

219
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:56,910
当时的平均气温已低至零下59摄氏度
As average temperatures plunged to a -75 degrees Fahrenheit,

220
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:01,610
赤道和今天的南极一样寒冷
the equator grew as cold then, as the South Pole is today.

221
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:07,870
而席卷全球的极寒  或许发生了两次
And this global deep freeze may have happened not once, but twice.

222
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:13,300
第一次发生在二十四亿年前
The first episode beginning 2.4 billion years ago.

223
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,360
在雪地球期间  整个地球的气候
During the Snowball Earth phase, the entire Earth has

224
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,180
都很像现在的南极地区气候
a climate quite similar to modern day Antarctica.

225
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,080
格雷格・劳克林
加利福尼亚大学  圣克鲁兹分校

226
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,600
极其寒冷  极其干燥
It's extremely cold, extremely dry,

227
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:27,860
狂风肆虐  荒芜一物
extremely windy, extremely inhospitable to life.

228
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:32,660
雪地球假设很好的解释了
The Snowball Earth hypothesis helps explain

229
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:37,860
曾是赤道的地区发现的冰川沉积物
the discovery of glacier deposits in areas that were once at the equator.

230
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:43,310
这一理论为  冰川从两极地区开始进发
It's theorized that as the glaciers marched on from the polar regions

231
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:46,100
它们把太阳光反射回宇宙
they reflected sunlight back into space

232
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,150
并且创造出一个强大的反馈回路
and created a powerful feedback loop,

233
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,260
无情地把地球气温一降再降
turning the thermostat relentlessly lower.

234
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,760
如果两极地区面积过大
If the polar regions get too large,

235
00:13:54,760 --> 00:14:00,190
如果雪和高反射率的冰层到达低纬度
if the snow and high reflective ice coatings get to far down in latitude

236
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:02,980
它们就能把更多的太阳光反射回宇宙
they reflect more light back into space.

237
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,490
地球就会变得更冷
The Earth gets cooler.

238
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:07,260
冰层也就会更靠近赤道
The ice goes closer and closer and closer to the equator

239
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,400
这也就形成了恶性循环
so it's gotta be kind of a runaway process

240
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,350
至少它将会将地球完全冻结
as the least it will freeze over of the Earth.

241
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:17,640
但是究竟是什么引发了首次雪地球期呢
But what caused the first Snowball Earth?

242
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,200
科学家们认为罪魁祸首可能是生命本身
Scientists think the culprit actually may have been life itself.

243
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:28,000
地球生命诞生之初  大气中的主要气体
The gas that was most prevalent when life first appeared in the Earth

244
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,250
不是氧气  而是甲烷
wasn't oxygen, it was methane.

245
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:34,180
那时的生命  单细胞细菌
Creatures at that time, single-celled bacteria

246
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:38,510
会将甲烷作为日常生存代谢过程的一部分
would have used methane as part of their normal living processes.

247
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:41,930
甲烷是一种显著的温室气体
Methane is a phenomenal greenhouse gas.

248
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:45,500
迈克尔・密史纳
美国宇航局  喷气推进实验所

249
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:45,450
如果大气中存在许多甲烷
So if you had a lot of methane in the atmosphere

250
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:48,110
那么很可能会产生较高的温度
you'd had likely very warm temperatures.

251
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:55,090
但24亿年前  一群新生的水生微生物
But 2.4 billion years ago, a new group of underwater microbes

252
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,720
开始从阳光中吸收能量
began absorbing energy from the Sun

253
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:01,130
这一过程被称为光合作用
in a process called photosynthesis.

254
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:06,410
通过将二氧化碳和水转化为能量
By converting carbon dioxide and water into energy,

255
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:11,900
光合作用形成的新的有毒废物开始污染地球
photosynthesis polluted the Earth with a toxic new waste product,

256
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,130
氧气
oxygen.

257
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:16,060
大量的氧气
Vast amounts of it.

258
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,840
在24亿年之前  氧气是毒气
Prior to 2.4 billion years ago, oxygen was a poison

259
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,680
任何地球上的生命都不需要氧气
and any life that was on Earth did not use oxygen,

260
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,490
氧气被认为是废气
it was considered a waste gas.

261
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,380
所有不喜氧气的生命
All of that life that didn't like oxygen

262
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:33,090
被暴露在富氧环境中
was exposed to this rich oxygen environment

263
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:35,740
情况开始变得很紧迫
and it caused great deal of stress.

264
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,950
甲烷生物快乐的生活在无氧世界中
Methane creatures were happy to live in this oxygen free world.

265
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:42,430
这时氧气出现了
Now, when oxygen finally does appear,

266
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:45,550
这是它们历史中最不幸的灾难
it was like the worst calamity in their history.

267
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:49,920
当氧气席卷全球时
As oxygen flooded the world,

268
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,750
甲烷被氧化
it oxidized methane

269
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,970
成为二氧化碳
turning it into carbon dioxide.

270
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:59,100
以甲烷为生的生物快速灭绝
The methane consuming creatures died off in a fast extinction event,

271
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,780
这被称为"大氧化事件"
called the great oxygen catastrophe.

272
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,440
由于地球失去了起保暖作用的甲烷
And as Earth lost its warming blanket of methane gas

273
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,350
整个星球开始冻结
the planet froze over.

274
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:13,090
如果是生产氧气的生命是
But if oxygen producing life, was the primary trigger

275
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:15,130
首次"雪地球"形成的主要诱因
of the first Snowball Earth,

276
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,450
这些生命现在需要则寻找到温暖的地方
that life now needed to find a warm place

277
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:21,410
来躲避由它们引起的灾难
to escape the disaster it had caused.

278
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,740
那时的地球比起现在  构造过程更活跃
The Earth at that time was even more energetic tectonically than it is now.

279
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,620
地球的形成会产生巨大的热量
The formation of the Earth produced enormous heat,

280
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,340
这些热量会来到地表  过程很慢
that heat comes to the surface, it's slowing,

281
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,940
但那时有许多火山  每个火山周围
but back then many more volcanoes, around every volcano

282
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:42,090
都会出现这样一个被融化的湖泊状地区
would have been this melted lake-like zone

283
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:43,810
生命就在这里蓬勃发展
where life could have thrived.

284
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,200
要演示火山活动如何为生命提供保温所
To show how volcanism could have carved out cozy niches for life

285
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:55,180
你只需要一把喷枪和一个大冰球
all you need is a blow torch and a big ball of ice.

286
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,180
我们在"冰雕店"
We are here at Carving Ice,

287
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,390
这是罗兰・赫尔南德斯所有的冰雕室
an ice house owned by Roland Hernandez,

288
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:04,240
他是一位出色地冰雕家  他为我们制作了
an amazing ice sculptor who has created for us

289
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,980
这个全冰的半球  代表"雪地球"
this hemisphere of solid ice which represents Snowball Earth.

290
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,590
我们把它放在这个推车上  
We've placed it up here on this dolly

291
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,850
以便能用工业喷枪  从下面加热
so that we can heat it from below with an industrial blow torch

292
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,810
用来演示在雪地球时期地下火山活动
to represent the type of heating that we would experience on Snowball Earth,

293
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:19,510
所带来的热量
from vulcanism deep beneath the surface.

294
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:21,110
现在我打开它
Now let me light this up.

295
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:26,580
-给你喷枪  -好的
- All right, passing you the torch. - Okay.

296
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,400
科学家们怀疑  由地表下的火山活动
Scientists suspect that the extreme heat pressure

297
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,590
所产生的极大的热量和压力
generated by volcanism beneath the Earth's surface

298
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,070
可能会使冰层开裂  从而为生命提供避难所
would have created cracks in the ice for life to take refuge.

299
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:52,650
你能看到这些裂缝是如何贯穿整个冰块 
Okay, so you can see how the cracks are formed all throughout the ice,

300
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,320
沿着顶端这里...
along the top here...

301
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,710
这同"雪地球"事件中出现的
These are very similar to the types of cracks

302
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:59,020
裂缝是非常相似的
that would form during a Snowball Earth event.

303
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,980
在这些裂缝中你就可以得到
It's in these cracks where you can get the mixture

304
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,410
一些液体  一些热量
of a little bit of liquid, a little bit of heat,

305
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:05,810
和一些化学物质的混合体
a little bit of chemistry,

306
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:08,420
换句话说  这是生命生根发芽
in other words, the perfect ingredients for generating

307
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:12,070
甚至蓬勃发展所需环境的完美组合
an environment where life can take root and even thrive.

308
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:18,370
火山活动并非只是生命
Volcanism wasn't just key

309
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,770
在雪地球时期生存的关键
to life survival during Snowball Earth.

310
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:27,530
它也许最终迫使了冰川的消退
It also may have forced the glaciers to finally retreat.

311
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:31,510
所有这些从火山口冒出的气体
See, all these gases that are coming out of the volcanoes,

312
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:35,310
例如水蒸气  二氧化碳  二氧化硫
things like water vapor, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide

313
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:38,340
它们都进入了大气之中
for example, which are escaping into the atmosphere

314
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,490
经过千万年的时间
and over time, over tens of millions of years,

315
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:44,500
它们不断地提高温室气体的水平
you're building up these levels of greenhouse gasses.

316
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,010
在某一时刻  大气变得足够温暖
At some point, it's going to get so warm in the atmosphere

317
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:49,940
冰川开始融化
that the ice begins to melt.

318
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,990
"雪地球"的两个时期
Both episodes of Snowball Earth,

319
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:56,550
首先是24亿年前
the first 2.4 billion years ago,

320
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,980
其次是6亿年前
and the second, 600 million years ago,

321
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,210
都对早期的生命产生了巨大的影响
placed profound stresses on early life.

322
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:10,980
但奇怪的是  两个时期后都有大量物种出现
But oddly, both were followed by enormous flowerings of new species.

323
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,250
通过沉积的地质记录
We know from the sedimentary record,

324
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,760
就在动物开始出现并繁荣前
that just before animals bloomed into existence,

325
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:22,090
大量的磷进入了海洋中
an enormous amount of phosphorous came in to the ocean,

326
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:24,040
大块的含磷岩石
there were big rocks of phosphorous

327
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:29,370
被腐蚀了  从而使得海洋中磷的含量上升
they eroded as that erosion occurred phosphorous levels in the ocean rose.

328
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:32,560
突然间生命开始繁荣发展了
All of a sudden life is able to just bloom.

329
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:38,020
这可能真正导致了两个时期的生命多样化
This may really have caused the diversification two times,

330
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:41,000
先是23亿年前微生物世界的多样化
of the microbial world, at 2.3 billion years ago,

331
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,890
更重要的是  对我们来说
but more importantly to us,

332
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:47,090
它可能很好地促进了6亿年前
it really probably helped the diversification of the animals

333
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:49,580
动物的多样化
that 600 million years ago.

334
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:56,480
虽然"雪地球"带来了地球上最严酷的气候
Although Snowball Earth produced some the planet's harshest weather,

335
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,400
生命不仅存活了下来
life not only managed to survive,

336
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,910
而且比以往更坚强的繁荣发展
it bounced back stronger than ever,

337
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:05,980
因此这次灾难只能在
which is why this disaster only ranks as number 5

338
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,180
灾难时刻中位列第五
on our list of worst days.

339
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,350
我们继续倒数
But as the countdown continues,

340
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,730
确凿的证据浮出水面
forensic evidence is finally emerging,

341
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:19,740
它将可能解释一场更极端的灾难
that just may explain a far deadlier cataclysm...

342
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,850
一次杀戮盛宴
A mass killing spree

343
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:27,130
恐怕可以说是地球上最古老的谋杀案了
that stands as the oldest murder mystery on the planet.

344
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:38,640
在我们倒数地球七大灾难时刻的时候
So far, on our countdown of the 7 worst days on Earth

345
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,840
我们看到地球曾在月球形成撞击中破损不堪
we've seen our planet battered, during the Moon forming impact,

346
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:47,780
被晚期重度轰炸洗礼
baptized by the Late Heavy Bombardment

347
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:53,530
被"雪地球"几乎完全冻住
and almost completely frozen over by Snowball Earth.

348
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:58,470
现在我们将再前进一亿年
Now we travel forward over a 100 million years,

349
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,540
地球经历了其历史上最大规模的屠杀之一
as the world is rocked by one of the greatest mass killings in its history.

350
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,440
第四位
Number four on our list.

351
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:11,480
奥陶纪大灭绝

352
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:11,480
奥陶纪大灭绝
The ordovician extinction.

353
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:20,310
在地球上数十亿年生命的历史中
In the billions of years of life on Earth,

354
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:27,060
99%曾出现过的物种最终都消亡了
99% of all species that ever lived have ultimately vanished.

355
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,800
大部分是由于五次大规模灭绝事件
Mostly due to five mass extinction events.

356
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:35,750
第一个便是奥陶纪时期
The first was during the ordovician period,

357
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:38,530
4.5亿年前
450 million years ago.

358
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:42,430
奥陶纪大规模灭绝是
The mass extinction during the ordovician is

359
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:46,120
唐・布朗李
华盛顿大学

360
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,860
在五大灭绝事件中最为神秘莫测
the most mysterious of the so called big five

361
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:49,310
主要由于它发生的年代最为久远
simply because it was the one that was the oldest.

362
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:52,240
而其余四个事件的发生时间据今越来越近
Everyone after that was closer to us in time

363
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,030
相隔时间越久远
and the further back in time you go

364
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:57,910
历史原貌对我们来说就越模糊
the more fuzzy our scientific view of the past is.

365
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,230
奥陶纪时期
During the Ordovician period,

366
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:05,800
地球上有三大洋和四大陆
the globe was covered with three major oceans, and four super continents.

367
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:09,700
陆地尚且贫瘠
The land was still bare,

368
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:12,740
海洋已遍布生物
but the oceans teamed with life,

369
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,420
包括艳丽的珊瑚
including brilliant corals

370
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,430
和地球最早的鱼类
and the planet's first fish.

371
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:22,560
然而一场突发的灾难横扫海洋
Then a mysterious cataclysm swept the seas,

372
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:25,280
地球上60%的生物
and 60% of life on Earth

373
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,100
灰飞烟灭
vanished.

374
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,750
有一系列的可能性解释
There's a couple of possibilities.

375
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:33,390
首先是地球再次变冷  原因何在
Number one, it got cold again, so why would it have gotten cold?

376
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:35,530
有可能是板块构造运动
Well, it could have been the plate tectonics

377
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:40,600
使得原本温暖的大陆南移至两级地区
moved all of the formerly warm continents down to the polar regions

378
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,970
导致整体性的降温
and that dropped the temperature of everything.

379
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:48,880
多年来  科学家将奥陶纪大灭绝
For years, the scientists blamed the Ordovician extinction

380
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:51,230
归咎于毁灭性的冰河时期
on a devastating ice age.

381
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,810
但现在一些研究者提出  
But now some researchers propose

382
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:59,180
罪魁祸首可能来自宇宙
that the mass killer could have been something from the cosmos.

383
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:01,170
例如伽马射线爆发
Like a gamma ray burst,

384
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:05,380
宇宙最强的爆发
the biggest blast in the universe.

385
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:11,070
伽马射线大爆发是由于
A gamma ray burst is a colossal explosion of a star

386
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:13,070
恒星不对称爆炸产生的
that occurs asymmetrically

387
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:15,770
两束方向相反的直线光束
there are two oppositely directed beams,

388
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:15,650
亚历克・菲力彭科
加州大学伯克利分校

389
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:19,220
充满高能速的粒子流和辐射
of very energetic, high speed particles and radiation,

390
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:22,540
像激光一样急速穿越宇宙空间
they go zipping through space, kind of like a laser beam.

391
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:25,720
如果光束接落到地球上
If that beam is aimed right at Earth

392
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,260
便会造成巨大的破坏
it can cause significant damage here.

393
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:33,640
一场大爆发将会蒸发掉
A large burst would vaporize

394
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,650
地球上三分之一的臭氧保护层
1/3 of the planet protective ozone layer.

395
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:40,390
地球遭受重创面的生物
And creatures on the side of the Earth facing the onslaught

396
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:43,240
它们将直接暴露在致命的宇宙辐射下
would suffer lethal radiation exposure.

397
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:47,740
我们可以在地球上演示
The destructive energy of a gamma ray burst

398
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:50,350
伽马射线大爆发的破坏力量
can be demonstrated here on Earth.

399
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,960
这是地球仪  代表奥陶纪末期的地球
Here's our globe, representing the Earth at the end of the ordovician period,

400
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,240
一部分科学家认为当时的大灭绝
a time where one group of scientists thinks

401
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,590
可能是伽马射线大爆发造成的
that a gamma ray burst may have triggered a mass extinction.

402
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,930
外面包裹的纸代表臭氧层
The paper represents the ozone layer

403
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:08,010
这把丙烷火枪模拟伽马射线爆发
and the gamma ray burst is represented by this propane torch.

404
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:25,770
8  9  10秒  仅仅这段时间
8, 9, 10 seconds were, that is all they say it would take

405
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,770
地球三分之一的臭氧层将被破坏
to destroy about 1/3 of the Earth's ozone.

406
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:33,090
当然伽马射线大爆发没让地球烧焦
So of course the gamma ray burst didn't actually torch the Earth

407
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:36,050
但当它到达地球时确实摧毁了臭氧层
but it did destroy the ozone that it encountered

408
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:39,000
其破坏了地球这一侧的
that would have messed with the chemistry of the ozone molecules

409
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,790
臭氧分子
on this side of the globe.

410
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,100
臭氧层遭到破坏后
And when the ozone was destroyed

411
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:44,950
劳拉・丹莉
格里菲斯天文台

412
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:44,950
紫外线就能直达地表
UV radiation can penetrate into the surface

413
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:48,240
紫外线辐射对生物是致命的
and the ultraviolet radiation is very lethal to life.

414
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,270
它能破坏DNA
It's very destructive to DNA.

415
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:55,860
因此伽马射线爆发对臭氧层的破坏
So, it may be that a gamma ray burst destroying the ozone layer

416
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,920
有可能促使甚至导致了
contributed or maybe even triggered

417
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:01,290
奥陶纪末期的大灭绝
a mass extinction at the end of the Ordovician.

418
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,850
削弱臭氧层的同时
In addition to depleting the ozone layer

419
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,570
伽马射线大爆发会破坏
a large gamma ray burst also could have ripped apart

420
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:14,640
大气层中氮气和氧气的分子结构
nitrogen and oxygen molecules in the atmosphere

421
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,130
生成二氧化氮  进而形成烟雾层
producing a gaseous smog of nitrogen dioxide

422
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:22,720
阻挡阳光射入  造成第二次劫难
that blocked sunlight and sent off a secondary disaster.

423
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,250
冰河时期
An ice age.

424
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:32,540
伽马射线爆发是否是诱因目前尚不明确
It's not clear whether that could have been caused by a gamma ray burst.

425
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:35,020
但至少奥陶纪的大灭绝
But at least part of the Ordovician extinction

426
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,570
有一个特征
seems to have been marked

427
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:41,540
即大量生活在地表的生物灭绝了
by a huge decrease in the number of surface dwelling creatures,

428
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,830
例如生活在陆地表面
like on the Earth's surface

429
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:45,160
或者是海洋浅水层的生物
or in the surface layers of the ocean.

430
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:50,040
这或许能够说明是紫外线辐射
That may well indicate that it was ultraviolet radiation

431
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:53,070
而非其他因素导致了生物死亡
that killed them off rather than some other factor.

432
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,090
伽马射线大爆发也许是
A gamma ray burst could be one explanation

433
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:02,720
地球第一次大灭绝的原因之一
for the first mass annihilation of life on Earth.

434
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,370
但一个惊人的新设想
But a startling new hypothesis

435
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:09,460
指向了另一种宇宙能量
points to a different cosmic force.

436
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:15,480
奇异而致命的弓形激波
A bizarre and potentially deadly phenomenon known as a bow shock.

437
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,050
弓形激波是运动物体前方的物质
A bow shock forms when there's compression

438
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:22,470
受到挤压时形成的
of material in front of a moving object.

439
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:25,240
举个例子  行驶在水中的船
So for example if you have a boat swimming along,

440
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,560
通过压迫正前方的水而形成波浪
it creates a wave a compression in front of it,

441
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,280
但随着船的前行水波便逐渐弯曲了
but then bends around as the boat moves through.

442
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:33,890
我们所在的星系在宇宙中快速运动
Well, our galaxy is moving rapidly through space.

443
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:37,760
因此它会挤压前方星系间的气体
So it can compress intergalactic gas in front of it

444
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,690
导致其升温并产生辐射
heating it up creating cosmic rays

445
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:44,110
部分辐射可能到达地球上
and some of those cosmic rays can then hit the Earth.

446
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:49,810
太阳系在银河系中来回运动
Our Solar System oscillates through the Milky Way

447
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:54,240
每6400万年在银河系主圆盘中
traveling above and below the main disc of the galaxy

448
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,670
上下运动一次
every 64 million years.

449
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:01,750
一旦脱离星系的保护性磁场
Once outside the galaxy protective magnetic field,

450
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:05,480
我们的地球便毫无保护的暴露在
our planet is vulnerable to deadly cosmic rays

451
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:08,270
星系弓形激波产生的致命宇宙射线中了
generated by the galactic bow shock.

452
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,830
这跟湖上的滑水者相似
Much like a wakeboarder on a lake.

453
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:25,710
滑水运动很好地解释了弓形激波的原理
Wakeboarding would be a reasonable example of bow shock in space.

454
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:25,620
迈克尔・密史纳
美国宇航局  喷气推进实验所

455
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:34,710
当滑水者处于快艇弓形波的范围内
While the wakeboarder is well within the confines of the bow wave of the boat

456
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:36,200
水面平稳  易于滑行
the water is very calm and smooth

457
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,260
站到板上很轻松
and he has no trouble standing up.

458
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:41,160
但当他滑出波浪的边缘时
But during those periods where he moves out of the edge of the wave

459
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,920
水面开始无序地波动
the water becomes a bit more turbulent and a bit more chaotic

460
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,710
他要站住就有些难了
and he has trouble standing up.

461
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,310
在宇宙空间里也是一样
The same thing is true in space,

462
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:53,460
大多数时间  
for most of the time,

463
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:56,790
太阳和地球都在银河系磁场的
the Earth and Sun are well within the protective confines

464
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:59,600
保护范围内
of the Milky Way galaxy's magnetic field

465
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,330
使它们不受弓形激波产生的
protecting it from the cosmic rays and other

466
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:04,900
宇宙射线或其他辐射影响
radiation that's coming in from the bow shock.

467
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,180
但当太阳和地球
But during those periods when the Earth and the Sun

468
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,270
飞出这艘"星系飞船"的顶端
rise above the galactic plane

469
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:13,400
就更容易受到其产生的宇宙射线的影响
is much vulnerable to all of these cosmic rays coming from the bow shock.

470
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:20,710
化石记录显示每隔6200万年
Fossil records indicate that the biodiversity of many species

471
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:25,160
大量物种的多样性增加和减少一次
may increase and decrease in 62 million years cycles.

472
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:28,370
该循环与地球每6400万年就会
Those cycles closely coinciding with the times of greatest

473
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:32,110
暴露于弓形激波宇宙射线下的时间
exposure to cosmic rays from the galactic bow shock

474
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:35,270
非常相近
which occur every 64 million years.

475
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,440
二者之间是否有一定联系
Could the two events be connected?

476
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:42,050
两次大灭绝恰好都发生在
Two of the mass extinctions happened to have occurred

477
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:47,160
太阳位于我们银河系最高端
at about the time when the sun was highest above the plane of our galaxy.

478
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:51,140
这意味着那个特殊的位置
That suggests that there is something about that particular location

479
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:54,370
其特殊之处导致了那些大灭绝
that's special, causing these mass extinctions.

480
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:58,930
奥陶纪大灭绝期间
During the Ordovician extinction,

481
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:02,410
地球可能因足量的星系弓形激波
Earth could have been blasted with enough deadly radiation

482
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:04,430
所产生的致命辐射
from the galactic bow shock

483
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:08,010
导致各种基因突变和DNA损害
to unleash genetic mutations and DNA damage

484
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:12,110
使得近半数物种灭绝
that wiped out over half of all species.

485
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:18,250
这个想法未经证实
This is not yet a well tested idea,

486
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:20,500
只是一个设想
it is just out there on the drawing board

487
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:24,550
但它可以解释地球大灭绝的
but it could explain some of the possible periodicity

488
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:26,610
一些可能性的周期性
in Earth's mass extinctions.

489
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:31,400
但当奥陶纪绝大部分物种都灭绝的时候
But while the Ordovician extinction was fatal to most species

490
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,470
有些物种抓住了机会
some grasped at the opportunity.

491
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:36,840
就像在花园里除草
It's like pulling weeds out of a garden,

492
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:40,320
你清扫  清除  花草变得稀疏
you sort of clean out and weed out and thin out.

493
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:43,370
奥陶纪的大灭绝似乎就是如此
That seems to have happened in the Ordovician mass extinctions.

494
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:47,550
物种此消彼长
Some creatures which died out allowed others to diversify.

495
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,380
奥陶纪是第一次大灭绝
The Ordovician was the first mass extinction

496
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,410
但不是最惨烈的
but hardly the worst.

497
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:00,510
地球第三大灾难时刻
Number three on our countdown of the worst days on Earth.

498
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:04,520
是最著名的史前灭绝
It's the most famous die off in pre-history.

499
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:08,470
但是如果你自认了解龙灭绝的原因
But if you think you know what killed the dinosaurs

500
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:10,830
你也许会大吃一惊
you may be in for a surprise

501
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:15,960
而现在  有些科学家认为
because some scientists now argue that

502
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:20,080
恐龙灭绝缘于一颗巨型陨石撞击的普遍说法
the common explanation of a single giant impact on a single disastrous day

503
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:23,530
可能是错误的
is itself about to be blasted away.

504
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:31,310
我们倒数的地球灾难时刻中
In our countdown to the very worst day on Earth,

505
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:35,560
没有哪次灾难的主题
no catastrophe has been the subject of

506
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,580
比大撞击最终为人类发展开道
more public fascination and sensational headlines

507
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:42,840
更能吸引大众且引起轰动了
than the bombardment that ultimately cleared the path for mankind.

508
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:49,820
但今天  争议性的新假设挑战
But today controversial new hypothesis challenge the concept

509
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:54,890
一次灾难性的撞击使恐龙灭绝的观点
that a single disastrous impact wiped out the dinosaurs

510
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:57,880
便是  地球第三大灾难时刻
and led to the third worst day on Earth.

511
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,510
白垩纪-第三纪灭绝

512
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:01,660
白垩纪-第三纪灭绝
The KT extinction.

513
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,020
六千五百万年前
65 million years ago

514
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:12,450
我们有类似于非洲的世界
we would have seen a world something like Africa,

515
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:14,440
因为动物数量众多
in terms of the numbers of animals out there.

516
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,200
但是没有哺乳动物  只有大恐龙
But instead of being mammals, we had big dinosaurs

517
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:17,040
彼得・沃德
华盛顿大学教授

518
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,690
大量的三角龙  成群的梁龙
herds of triceratops, herds of diplo dinosaurs,

519
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:25,810
大小不一的食肉恐龙  最大的是霸王龙
small to big predators, the largest being T-Rex.

520
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:33,490
恐龙在史前世界称霸了约2亿年
Dinosaurs ruled the pre-historic world for almost 200 million years,

521
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:39,390
之后某物灭绝了地球上三分之二的生物
then something took out 2/3 of all living creatures

522
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,720
包括巨型野兽[恐龙]
including the giant beasts.

523
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:50,060
研究多年以后  绝大部分专家认为
After years of searching for clues, most experts now agree

524
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:54,490
一次大灾难终结了恐龙
that a single cataclysm doomed the dinosaurs.

525
00:31:55,280 --> 00:32:00,300
6500万年前一颗直径9.6公里的小行星撞击地球
The evidence for an impact of a 6-mile wide asteroid 65 million years ago,

丹・杜尔达 
西南研究所

527
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:03,170
科学上已经很好的证明了这一点
is about as good as anything gets in science.

528
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,840
六千五百万年前  
65 million years ago,

529
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,440
一块珠穆朗玛峰体积的岩石
a rock the size of Mount Everest

530
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,430
破空而落
barreled down from the sky

531
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:14,270
撞入尤卡坦半岛
and slammed into the Yucatan peninsula

532
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:16,530
位于现在的墨西哥希克苏鲁伯附近
near modern Chicxulub, Mexico.

533
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:23,330
此次撞击引发了一条毁灭链 
The impact unleashed an unstoppable chain of destruction.

534
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:27,450
从该地区开始  然后横扫全球
First locally, and then across the globe.

535
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:30,790
第三纪灭绝是由小行星撞击引起的
The KT is an asteroid driving to an extinction

536
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:32,830
当其撞击地球时
when a big rock from the space came down

537
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:34,730
小部分恐龙直接死亡
clunked a few dinosaurs on the head.

538
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:38,300
但是毁灭机制却是这件事的副效应
But the kill mechanism was really the secondary effects of this.

539
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,030
它导致大气层变黑
It would have been darkened the atmosphere

540
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:44,450
酸雨  整个生物圈改变
acid rain, a change in the entire biosphere.

541
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,610
但是单一碰撞学说的反对者
But opponents of the single impact theory,

542
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:50,360
举出一组令人信服的证据
point to a convincing array of evidence,

543
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:54,930
包括第三纪灭绝事件地质层或死亡层中
including high levels of the asteroid element iridium

544
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:59,920
具有高含量的小行星元素铱
at the KT event's geological boundary or death layer.

545
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,920
当然这个确凿的证据本身
And of course the smoking gun itself,

546
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:06,230
就是现代墨西哥的水下火山口
the underwater crater in modern Mexico.

547
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:10,530
但是旧案得以了结吗
But is this cold case finally closed?

548
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,920
一些科学家现在认为
Some scientists now argue that the

549
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,100
尤卡坦半岛的小行星有共犯
Yucatan asteroid had accomplices.

550
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:19,080
似乎很多原因都可能触发这次事件
There's seems to be various causes that could trigger this.

551
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,750
有时候  几个原因同时出现
In some cases, several causes come together

552
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,990
格雷格・鲁克林
加州大学圣塔克鲁兹分校

553
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:23,950
造成很糟糕的情况
and sort of confluence of bad circumstances

554
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:27,590
导致了具有特殊破坏性的灭绝事件
to provide a particularly damaging extinction event.

555
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:31,190
第三纪毁灭之前的数百万年
Millions of years before the KT extinction

556
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:35,330
已经有巨大的熔岩流注入德干岩群
vast lava flows had been pouring out into the Deccan traps,

557
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:40,020
那是现在位于印度西南的系列熔岩层
a series of lava beds, now located in southwest India.

558
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:44,720
这些溢流玄武岩曾喷出的岩浆
These flood basalts once spewed out enough magma

559
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,420
能覆盖1600万平方公里
to cover over a million square miles,

560
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:50,360
并喷出一种有毒的气体
and belched up a toxic brew of gases

561
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,570
也许改变了整个地球的气候
that could have altered the climate around the world.

562
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:58,400
火山爆发的时间
That period of eruption is pretty coincident

563
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,540
与六千五百万年前的灭绝也很符合
with the extinction 65 million years ago, as well.

564
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,420
实际上  在第三纪撞击和大灭绝之前
In fact, they were going on millions of years

565
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:06,080
这种情况已经持续了几百万年
before the KT impact and before the extinctions.

566
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,540
所以  原因也许是一个复合因素
And, so, perhaps can be a complicating factor.

567
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:15,070
在这个假设里  恐龙被双重淘汰
In this scenario, the dinosaurs received a double knockout blow.

568
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,460
首先是德干岩群的活跃的火山活动
First the rapid volcanism of the Deccan traps,

569
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:23,400
然后是尤卡坦半岛撞击
then the Yucatan impact.

570
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,680
一小群反对者甚至宣称
And a small group of dissenters goes even further,

571
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:34,060
在六千五百万年前的几乎同一时间
claiming that multiple asteroids stroke Earth

572
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:38,150
有多次小行星撞击地球
at roughly the same time 65 million years ago.

573
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:43,450
他们认为  尤卡坦半岛撞击不算最剧烈
According to them, the Yucatan impact wasn't the largest,

574
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:46,100
只是人类对其记录很完整
only the best documented.

575
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:51,100
有些人认为可能有多次撞击
Some people think that there may be have been multiple impacts,

576
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,260
亚历克・菲力彭科
加州大学伯克利分校

577
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,700
陨石雨般的撞击
a shower of impacts, for example.

578
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:57,610
也许他们来自同一物体  它碎成数块
Perhaps they came from a single object that broke apart.

579
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,820
这种假设的支持者
Supporters of this hypothesis

580
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:03,910
指出了一种可疑的地质特征
point to a suspicious geologic feature,

581
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:08,410
印度海岸处有块直径595公里的盆地
a 370-mile basin off the coast of India.

582
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:12,660
比尤卡坦半岛撞击点面积大三倍多
More than 3 times larger than the Yucatan impact site.

583
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:17,620
但对于这个所谓的湿婆陨石坑  争论不断
But controversy swirls around this so called Shiva crater,

584
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:20,800
它以印度教毁灭神的名字命名
named after the Hindu god of destruction,

585
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:24,650
讨论包括它到底是不是个火山口
including whether it is even a crater at all.

586
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:30,650
虽然它的外型像个环状的大坑
While this feature certainly looks circular and looks crater-like

587
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:34,380
但是没有其他证据证明它的确是撞击所致
there is no other evidence that it's an actual impact structure.

588
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,260
虽然恐龙灭绝争论不一
For some the dinosaur die-off debate rages on.

589
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,310
但是大部分科学家都认为
But most scientists agree

590
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:45,470
这次毁灭事件对于小型哺乳动物来说
the apocalyptic event was a very fortunate day

591
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:47,420
却是很幸运的
for small mammals,

592
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:50,480
它们再也不必成为霸王龙的盘中餐了
that were no longer dinner for T-Rex.

593
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:54,030
如果没有第三纪大撞击和火山作用
Had it not been for the KT impact and the volcanism

594
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:54,720
劳拉・丹莉
格里菲斯天文台

595
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,250
也就是恐龙灭绝的时候
that was also at the time of the extinction of the dinosaurs,

596
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:02,480
也许哺乳动物就不可能崛起
the mammals probably wouldn't have reason to the prominence that they did

597
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,400
由于哺乳动物的崛起
and thank heaven for the rise of mammals

598
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,580
人类得以起源
because that led to the rise of humans.

599
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:11,310
第三纪灭绝引发了一个严峻的问题
A KT extinction raises a sobering question...

600
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:15,790
是否有一天人类也会跟恐龙的下场一样
Could humans one day go the way of the dinosaurs?

601
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:21,850
这是来自密歇根艾德里安市的汤姆・莫尔想要
That's what viewer Tom Moore from Adrian, Michigan wanted to

602
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,740
询问宇宙的问题
ask The Universe.

603
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:31,870
地球会再次与一颗第三纪时期大小的小行星相撞吗
-汤姆・莫尔  密歇根  艾德里安市

604
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:34,620
汤姆  地球绝对可能会遭受
Well, Tom, Earth could definitely be hit

605
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:37,330
另一颗第三纪时期大小的彗星或小行星的撞击
by another KT-sized comet or asteroid.

606
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:38,500
它们就在那
They're out there.

607
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:42,320
好消息是我们正追踪大部分大行星的位置
The good news is we are tracking the position of most of the big ones.

608
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,770
如果我们发现一颗可能撞向地球
So if we ever find one with Earth's name written on it

609
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:49,020
希望能在它撞击地球前将其打偏
hopefully we'll be able to deflect it before it reaches Earth.

610
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:53,450
白垩纪-第三纪灭绝事件终结了霸王龙
The KT event toppled T-Rex,

611
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:56,470
但这只能算作是
but it only ranks as number three

612
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,550
第三大地球灾难时刻
on our countdown of worst days on Earth.

613
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:04,330
排名第二的是最惨烈的灭绝
Number two was the mother of all extinctions,

614
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:08,610
地球生物所经历的最惨烈的毁灭事件
the greatest die-off that life on Earth has ever suffered.

615
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:13,530
这仍是科学领域最大的未解之谜之一
It is also been one of the biggest unsolved mysteries in science,

616
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,610
直到现在
until now.

617
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:26,200
随着灾难倒数的高潮临近
As we near the climax of our countdown

618
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:30,410
我们重新开启最古老的未解悬案
we reopen one of the oldest cold cases,

619
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:36,970
这个未解谋杀之谜发生在2亿5千万年前
an unsolved murder mystery that happened 250 million years ago,

620
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:43,610
大约在恐龙灭绝两亿年前
almost 200 million years before the downfall of the dinosaurs.

621
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,170
第二大灾难时刻  
The second worst day

622
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,530
见证了地球史上规模最大的物种灭绝
witness the greatest mass extinction in the planet's history.

623
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:51,990
大灭绝

624
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:55,470
一次被称为大灭绝的灾难
A cataclysm known as the great dying.

625
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:01,880
二叠纪期间  地球上充满了
During the Permian period, Earth was a wondrous world

626
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,660
类哺乳的爬行动物和奇异的海洋生物
of mammal-like reptiles and exotic sea creatures.

627
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:11,810
之后  95%的生物从这颗星球上消失
Then, 90% of all life disappeared from the planet.

628
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,490
这是地球上命运多舛的几万年
This is a bad few hundred thousand years on planet Earth,

629
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:16,960
但确是最具灾难性的
but it was certainly the most catastrophic.

630
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,680
彼得・沃德
华盛顿大学教授

631
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:23,870
此次生物灭绝数量之多  可能空前绝后
More life died then, than any time since and maybe any time before.

632
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:26,180
也是规模最大  死亡最惨重的一次
This was the biggest and the baddest of them all.

633
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:31,560
几十年来  科学家们搜寻线索
For decades, scientists have sifted through clues,

634
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,740
试图揭开大灭绝的谜团
struggling to solve the mystery of the great dying,

635
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:39,400
那时的生物真是命悬一线啊
when the survival of life itself seemed to hang by a thread.

636
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:44,600
其中可能性最大的是
One of the prime suspects

637
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:49,550
一座超级火山冲破西伯利亚  地裂数百公里
a super volcano that tore Siberia open for hundreds of miles

638
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:52,800
喷发了至少一百万年
erupted for at least a million years

639
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:56,940
产生了史上最大规模的熔岩流
and produced the greatest lava flows ever known,

640
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:02,290
足以将整个美国埋在数百米深的熔岩流下
enough to bury the entire United States, thousands of feet deep.

641
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,540
这不只是座巨型火山
This wasn't a single giant volcano,

642
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,480
简直就是地表开裂
it was simply cracks in the Earth

643
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,670
喷射熔岩一样
and they were like pumping out lava.

644
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:13,520
那就像是消防水龙头  岩浆喷涌到处都是
It's like a fire hose, spewing lava everywhere.

645
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:16,640
熔岩所经之处  必将生灵涂炭
Well that sort of would have killed anything in its way.

646
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:19,860
人们相信这些煤层
It's believed that you have these beds of coal

647
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,420
就在现在的西伯利亚
on what it is now Siberia,

648
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:24,280
熔岩在煤层之下喷发
which then had lava erupting underneath them

649
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,680
将煤燃烧并产生有害的温室气体
and burning the coal and putting sorts of noxious

650
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,740
格雷格・鲁克林
加州大学圣塔克鲁兹分校

651
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:29,230
和其他有毒气体进入大气中
greenhouse and other toxic gasses into the atmosphere

652
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:33,230
对生物圈的影响非常可怕
and really putting strong stress on to the biosphere.

653
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:37,860
与日俱增的全球变暖给多数动物带来灾难
The increased global warming was fatal to most animals.

654
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:42,590
但植物通常靠二氧化碳生长
But plants usually thrived on carbon dioxide,

655
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,710
那么为何它们也经历了史无前例的灭绝呢
so why did they also succumb at rates that have never been equal?

656
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:51,120
我们认为的  也是刚发现的
There's a second killer in the story

657
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,510
这次事件的二号杀手
that we think and just now discovering,

658
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:56,170
是地球上第一次出现的
and that's the presence for the first time on the planet

659
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:59,650
大量硫酸氢气体
of massive amounts of hydrogen sulphate gas.

660
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:03,650
同坏鸡蛋所散发的气体一样  绝对的毒气
The same stuff you see with rotten eggs, that is a true poison

661
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:06,510
我觉得  它与热结合
and yet with the heat combined I think

662
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:08,970
造成了规模最大的生物灭绝
it caused this greatest of mass extinctions.

663
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:14,470
如果科学陪审团仍然在为
If the scientific jury is still debating the cause

664
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:16,860
三叠纪灭绝的原因辩论
of the Permian-Triassic extinction,

665
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,950
他们一致认为那段时间是到目前为止
no one disputes that those were the darkest days

666
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:24,120
地球上最黑暗的日子
for life on our planet so far.

667
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:31,130
但地球上的生命不能  也不会幸免于
But life on Earth cannot and will not survive an event

668
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:35,930
一次科学家预测的如死亡一样必然的事件
that scientists predict it's as unavoidable as death itself.

669
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:38,900
地球第一大灾难时刻
The number one worst day on planet Earth.

670
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,920
末日审判

671
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,110
末日审判
The solar apocalypse.

672
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:50,290
再过50亿年  太阳将走到生命的尽头
In five billion years, our Sun will reach the end of its life,

673
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,260
随着核燃料的耗尽
as it exhausts its nuclear fuel,

674
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,530
它将经受一次毁灭性的转变
it will undergo a disastrous transformation

675
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,650
膨胀成一颗巨型恒星
bloating into a red giant star

676
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,520
是现在体积的二百倍
200 times its original size.

677
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:09,430
其膨胀过程中  它将首先吞掉水星
As it swells, it will first engulf Mercury,

678
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:11,140
之后是金星
then Venus,

679
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:16,350
被烧烬的地球也将被推上更远轨道
the incinerated Earth will either be pushed to a higher orbit

680
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,410
或是被吞没
or swallowed itself.

681
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,320
好消息是  太阳烧烬地球的那一天
The goods news, humans won't be around

682
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,770
人类早已不在此生活了
the day our Sun incinerates Earth.

683
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:31,190
但在这之前  我们将长期被烈日烘烤
Bad news, we will have been roasted long before.

684
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:38,840
太阳逐渐变亮  大约每十亿年增加百分之十
The Sun gets brighter, about 10% every billion years

685
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:41,140
因此  不到十亿年
and so in less than a billion years,

686
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:43,020
太阳将变得足够明亮
the Sun will be bright enough.

687
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,580
据估计  这会抽走大气中的几乎所有
It's predicted that it will pump basically all

688
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:49,980
或是大部分的二氧化碳
or most of the carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere,

689
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:54,030
那些依赖二氧化碳生存的生物  如植物
and so things that rely on carbon dioxide like plants

690
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:57,950
将很难在自然界中生存
are gonna have a hard time surviving in a natural world.

691
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:03,960
随着星球枯萎和海洋蒸发
As plants shrivel and oceans evaporate

692
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:08,150
生物学家预测未来将有一次超级大灭绝
biologists predict a future mega-mass extinction.

693
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,550
动物时代将在五亿年内结束
The age of animals will end in about 500 million years.

694
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:20,460
我们在未来有足够的时间像动物一样生存
We have as much time in the future to be alive as an animal

695
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:22,610
就像过去一样  我们已经成功一半了
as we had in the past, we're half way through,

696
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:24,210
这是个好消息
that's a sobering thought.

697
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:38,180
我们目睹了地球经历了形成月球的撞击
We've seen Earth smacked by the giant Moon forming impact,

698
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:42,830
在晚期大轰炸时期  被狂轰乱炸  横扫一空
strafed and sterilized during the Late Heavy Bombardment

699
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,250
以及冰冻成一个巨大的雪地球
and frozen into a giant snowball,

700
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:52,000
在第一次大规模灭绝期间
a cosmic force ravished an ancient water world

701
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:54,390
宇宙能量灭绝了古海底世界
during the first mass extinction,

702
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:59,200
大灭绝期间  一次近似全体消亡紧跟其后
followed by a near total extinction during the Great Dying

703
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:03,300
还有恐龙时代的惊人落幕
and the spectacular fall of the dinosaurs.

704
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:07,570
在地球最终被太阳炙烤之前
What else lies in store

705
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:12,630
还会发生什么呢
before our planet is ultimately baked by the Sun...?

706
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:17,400
地球在死亡前
Earth will certainly continue to experience

707
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,300
必定会继续经历灾难
disasters all the way up until the very end

708
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:24,600
直至太阳的红巨星阶段为地球画上句号
and sun's red giant phase brings ends to the story.

709
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:29,470
历史证明地球是一颗不可预知的星球
History has proven that Earth is an unpredictable planet

710
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:33,970
环绕在一个非常危险的银河地带
orbiting in a very dangerous galactic neighbourhood.

711
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:40,500
为了生存  人类必须从过往灾难中学习
To survive, mankind must learn from the worst days of our past

712
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:44,550
试着在未知的宇宙事件发生前做好准备
and try to prepare for whatever the cosmos might throw at us,

713
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:49,350
只有增加对宇宙的认识
only by increasing our knowledge of the universe,

714
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:51,730
我们才可能繁荣发展并好好享受
and we hope to thrive and fully enjoy

715
00:43:51,970 --> 00:43:56,840
地球上最后的五亿年
our final 500 million years of life on Earth.
