00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:02,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I still have plenty enough essence left to carry out my delightfully diabolical plan.

106
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now,my adoring public desires me.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are not more popular than I am.

121
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A little green dot?

122
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:07,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why do you get all the little green dots?

123
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:09,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get it,get it.

124
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Father's going to love this.

00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:38,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And round 12 goes to the Naughties.

139
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:43,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well said,my dim brother.

140
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:45,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Apparently,it wasn't a gift,Azrael.

141
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was a trap.

142
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Very amusing,my little Naughties. - Hey!

143
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did we please you,Father?

144
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,no,you didn't.

145
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:58,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what would please me,Vexy,if you were blue like real Smurfs,

146
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:02,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then your essence would endow me with real magic like that of a true-blue Smurf.

147
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:05,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That would excite me.

148
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Instead,you're both just deeply disappointing experiments.

149
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:09,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Experiment?

150
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like my traitorous Smurfette.

151
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:16,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The banner goes over there,please. Thank you,and I love the pinata.

152
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:19,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- How's that,Gutsy? - A little lower,Grouchy.

153
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want to be able to whack him right in the smurf berries.

154
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey,Grouchy. Hey,Gutsy.

155
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:27,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What a cake! Smurfette's gonna love this party!

156
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey,who smurfed a bite out of Smurfette's birthday cake?

157
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Not me. - I don't know.

158
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Greedy? - What? Why you all looking at me?

159
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:36,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey,Brainy,here's my present for Smurfette's surprise party.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- would fall for your sophomoric gag? - Yep.

162

00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Daddy,can we cut the cake?

207
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:54,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah. - All right,let's do that.

208
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:55,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cut it.

209
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Boy,who thought parenting could be so complicated?

210
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yummy. - Seriously,guys?

211
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:00,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You guys make it look easy.

212
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah,you must have had a great role model.

213
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,not really.

214
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:08,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- My dad took off when I was five,so... - Am I late?

215
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did I miss all the presents?

216
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:12,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey!

217
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Grandpa Vicster! - Hey!

218
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:18,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Happy birthday,Blue.

219
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now it's a party. Hello.

220
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:22,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm Victor,Patrick's dad.

221
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:25,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you must all be his friends,which makes you my friends.

222
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:26,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So let's go.

223
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Arms in the air,you're all getting hugs.

224
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:29,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey,okay.

225
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:32,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought you said your father left you.

226
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:34,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He did. This is my stepfather.

227
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll want him to leave. Just wait.

228
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello. Where's my Gracie?

229
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hey. - Victor.

230
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How are you?

231
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know,ever since Blue was born,

232
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I kind of miss you being as big as a house with more of you to hug.

233
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yep.

234
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:50,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And now,I've saved the biggest hug for last.

235
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Boundaries,please. Boundaries. - Let's show them how it's done.

236
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Unhand me.

237
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't like this at all.

238
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

239
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's nothing like the embrace of two proud Doyle men.

240
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:03,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am not a Doyle man.

241
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Little Paddy Doyle.

242
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Winslow. - Okay,compromise. Winslow.

243
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hyphen-Doyle.

244
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:13,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey,isn't he the guy from the Korndog commercials on TV?

245
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:15,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hey,you're right. - Well,you got me.

246
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Korndog King. - No,no,no.

247
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- One moment. - Please not this.

248
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now,in honour of Blue's birthday,

249
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:23,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going to present each and every one of you with a free Korndog...

250
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Thank you. - ...on the house.

251
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Teriaki dog.

252
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:28,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's for you.

253
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do these have any peanuts?

254
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I would never put peanuts in a Korndog.

255
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great.

256
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go ahead,big guy,it's okay.

257
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For the simple reason,you see,we deep-fry them in peanut oil.

258
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Peanut oil?

259
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:42,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What? - Johnny,spit it... Spit it out right away!

260
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay,I got the phone,okay.

261
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:47,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Spit it out,Johnny! Spit it out right away! Into Mama's hands.

262
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:48,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Deep breath for the EpiPen.

263
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's okay. - What's happening to that kid's lips?

264
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:58,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Azrael,bring me my plan. - Father?

265
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's in the bathroom. Check my side of the sink.

266
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Father?

267
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:02,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's feeding time.

268
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hackus dizzy.

269
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes,I almost forgot.

270
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Apparently,I have to keep you alive.

271
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hope you both appreciate what a tremendous burden this is upon me.

272
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right,mind your manners.

273
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

274
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:20,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you were real Smurfs,I'd be taking essence from you.

275
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:24,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't hear a "thank you."

276
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Close enough. Come,come.

277
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:30,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We must review my plan before tonight's raid on Smurf Village.

278
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:35,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is not my writing parchment. Where is my plan?

279
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:37,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Gone digital"?

280
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't understand what that means.

281
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:43,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes,phase one,"Create Naughties." Yes.

282
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Check. Where is phase two?

283
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am enamoured of that swiping motion.

284
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes,get away,get away,get away,get away.

285
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:57,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Phase three... Swipe.

286
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I capture my ungrateful daughter

287
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:04,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and force her to tell me the secret formula that Papa used to turn her blue.

288
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:05,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Swipe.

289
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I turn you and hundreds other like you blue.

290
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:08,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hackus blue!

291
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hackus blue!

292
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I place you into a terrifying machine and extract your essence.

293
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What? - And then,

294
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:19,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the entire world shall bow before me!

295
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:23,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will that extracting thing hurt?

296
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's excruciatingly painless.

297
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:28,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll see,it'll be fun,for me.

298
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anyway,we're getting ahead of ourselves.

299
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:36,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Back to phase two,the very reason we came to this cheese-infested metropolis.

300
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:39,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The great iron spire.

301
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The only possible way

302
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:45,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to harness enough energy to create a portal right into the heart of Smurf Village.

303
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How I love portal creation.

304
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come,come,let us away! To the iron spire!

305
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It worked!

306
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes! Just enough essence!

307
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:50,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And now I will go down in history!

308
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:53,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing can stop me now!

309
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My Gargaberries!

310
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,no!

311
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:09,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now I shall prove my genius!

312
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:14,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Head spin!

313
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:24,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It appears I lack sufficient essence to create a human-size portal.

314
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Father,I can fit through there. Let me get Smurfette.

315
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:28,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hackus go! Hackus go!

316
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hey! - Hackus go!

317
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes,yes. Well,let's see here.

318
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:37,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Eeny,meeny,miny... - Pick me! Pick me!

319
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Moron.

320
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes!

321
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:42,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hey,Hackus,listen to this. - What?

322
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I win.

323
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nicely played,Vexy.

324
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now,I must warn you.

325
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:49,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your destination is a true horror.

326
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:54,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A realm filled with the relentless crushing quiet of peace,

327
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:57,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}punctuated by the wretched cacophony of joyousness.

328
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's horrible. - What a nightmare.

329
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes,yes,it completely ruined your sister.

330
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's such a shame when a bad girl turns good.

331
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So true.

332
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:08,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But she does know the secret formula,

333
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:12,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so go get Smurfette!

334
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just don't get it.

335
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They know how tough my birthday can be,

336
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:25,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and they didn't even remember.

337
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe Papa was wrong.

338
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:31,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guess I'll never really be one of them.

339
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh,no! - Help.

340
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:41,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please,wait.

341
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:44,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I escaped.

342
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Escaped?

343
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:48,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}From the evil wizard who made me.

344
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:52,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you mean Gargamel?

345
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is Gargamel your father?

346
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

347
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:59,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But he's...

348
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That means you're just like me.

349
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Gotcha! - What are you doing?

350
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Father's going to be very happy.

351
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Smurfette's in trouble!

352
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:09,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Crikey! - Oh,no!

353
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Come on,Smurfs! - Smurfette!

354
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

355
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:15,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh,no,you don't. - No!

356
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:17,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Let go! - Now get in there!

357
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,no!

358
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- She's being smurf napped. - Unhand her!

359
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:25,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So long,Smurfs.

360
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Smurfette! - Smurfette!

361
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:28,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are we gonna do now?

362
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:33,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My powers of deduction lead me to believe that this is the work of Gargamel.

363
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,no,oh,no!

364
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:43,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yes! - Pretty blue.

365
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gargamel.

366
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:48,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Smurfette. Welcome home.

367
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're wasting your time,Gargamel.

368
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Papa and the others are gonna come for me.

369
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:02,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think so.

370
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They came for Clumsy.

371
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:09,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes,but you see,Clumsy was a real Smurf.

372
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whereas I was the one who created you.

373
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:16,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You do remember that,don't you,dear?

374
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:21,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not my father. Just let me go home.

375
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course.

376
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anything you say,

377
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:30,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but first,I will need one itsy-bitsy,teeny-tiny little thing first.

378
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Teeny-tiny. - What?

379
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:38,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just the secret formula that Papa used to turn you into a real Smurf.

380
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hackus real Smurf. Hackus blue!

381
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:42,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like you,blondie.

382
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:45,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It would benefit us both,don't you see,my dear?

383
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:48,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You give me the formula,I turn my little Naughties blue.

384
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Blue. - I use their essence

385
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to continue with my wonderful magic show here.

386
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:58,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That way I never have to bother you or Smurf Village again.

387
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:01,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't trust you,and I'm not telling you anything.

388
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:06,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,perhaps you need a little persuasion,eh?

389
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Naughties,attack!

390
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With pleasure.

391
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Attack!

392
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No,no,no,not each other. - Not me!

393
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:15,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got you...

394
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hackus!

395
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:18,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kitty,kitty,kitty.

396
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not the cat,not the...

397
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:25,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Deeply,deeply disappointing experiments.

398
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've got to rescue Smurfette.

399
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's our plan to bring Smurfette home?

400
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right,Smurfs,listen up.

401
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:35,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I saved enough grotto water from the last blue moon for just such an occasion.

402
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:38,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was able to smurf it into smurfportation crystals.

403
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:42,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you don't need a portal. Very clever,Papa.

404
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Smurf-xactly.

405
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:46,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These will take us directly to Master Winslow's mushroom.

406
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah,Patrick and Grace helped us last time we smurfed through the portal.

407
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Precisely! They'll know what to do!

408
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Sign me up! - Sign me up.

409
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- At your service,Papa. - Pick me!

410
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:55,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Did someone say,"Baker should go"? - I would rather not.

411
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Me,me,pick me,Papa!

412
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now,now,Smurfs. I only had water enough for nine crystals.

413
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:04,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's me and three others round trip,plus Smurfette on the way home.

414
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Assuming you can find her,which you won't.

415
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:10,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not a very smurfy attitude,Grouchy.

416
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Actually,for me,that was pretty good.

417
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:15,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll need courage,intelligence and strength.

418
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- So Gutsy. - Aye.

419
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:18,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Brainy. - Of course.

420
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hefty. - You got it.

421
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You'll smurf with me. - Yeah,can I...

422
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:23,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes,Passive-Aggressive Smurf?

423
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:27,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think Brainy is a really excellent choice.

424
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:28,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good luck with that.

425
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see what he does?

426
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:32,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That's not a compliment. - Go figure.

427
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:34,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Okay,Hefty,take one. - Let's do this.

428
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Go get her,guys! - Oops!

429
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Clumsy.

430
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Somebody do something!

431
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stand back! I know the Smurflich manoeuvre.

432
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He doesn't look good.

433
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:44,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,dear,he's turning blue-er.

434
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:45,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not good.

435
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Somebody get my hammer!

436
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nice going,Clumsy.

437
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:54,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got it!

438
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cheerio!

439
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This was supposed to be Hefty!

440
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry! My bad!

441
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I get so puffy when I travel.

442
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:03,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bye.

443
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:07,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,sometimes,you got to smurf with the changes.

444
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:08,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Travel safe,Papa.

445
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:11,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And so Papa and his B team...

446
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:12,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll be in charge while you're gone!

447
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:15,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- And so Papa... - Go get Smurfette back!

448
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:17,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Come on! - And bring her home!

449
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:23,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm glad his throat opened up and his lips are back to normal.

450
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Again,we're so sorry.

451
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If... Hello?

452
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:33,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Johnny can breathe again,which makes two of us since both of his parents are lawyers.

453
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,that's why they overreacted.

454
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They didn't overreact.

455
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's dying.

456
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:43,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think it's time for this.

457
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You didn't bring the crown. Don't put the crown on him.

458
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:47,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on,you used to love this crown.

459
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No,I didn't. - Yes,you did.

460
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You wore it everywhere. - I did not.

461
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:52,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Never did. Never once.

462
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the way you do it... Look.

463
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you see what is going on out there?

464
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah,they're bonding.

465
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Technically,they're spitting. - Come on.

466
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Blue needs to know that family's not just you and me,

467
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and it's really good for him to play with his grandfather.

468
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:12,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good job!

469
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh,yeah. He's a terrific role model. - Come on,Patrick.

470
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grace,he ruins everything.

471
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:20,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He shows up,and he ruins things. That's what he does.

472
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:23,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just like when he first moved into my house.

473
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He sent my parrot away.

474
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:26,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your parrot?

475
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My father's parrot.

476
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:35,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When my dad took off,he left Zeus,and I loved that bird.

477
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:40,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was a kid,and Zeus was the only part of my dad I had left.

478
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There you go.

479
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

480
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:00,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get Blue. Blue?

481
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Blue?

482
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:06,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Blue! Victor!

483
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Stay there. - Victor,do you have Blue?

484
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Victor! We can't get the door open!

485
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Victor!

486
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:25,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Victor,open the door! - Victor,we can't open the door!

487
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't see! I can't see!

488
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:37,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm on a dark,lifeless planet that smells like corn dogs!

489
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,the smurfanity.

490
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:48,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry,mister. Your face got in the way.

491
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Is that Clumsy? Smurfs? - Clumsy?

492
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Help! - Look out,Grouchy

493
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:55,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Clumsy,is that you? - This way!

494
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm blind! - No,you're in a corn dog.

495
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I knew it would end this way!

496
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where am I?

497
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This place is strange and terrifying

498
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and so handsome.

499
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello,you.

500
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:13,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everyone is ok?

501
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

502
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're lost in the dark,and it smells like corn dogs!

503
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Watch out!

504
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:21,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Master Winslow's gotten old.

505
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:23,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Wait,wait,wait. - Blue?

506
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:25,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop,stop,stop. They're friends.

507
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:26,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Friends? - Yeah.

508
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:28,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're little blue aliens trying to steal our faces.

509
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,no,they're called Smurfs.

510
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:33,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And they are the sweetest little things you ever did see.

511

516
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Is that Blue? - He's huge.

517
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wouldn't want to be the stork that brought that guy.

518
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:53,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,if Blue likes the Smurfs,then Vicster likes the Smurfs.

519
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What a thrill this must be for all of you.

520
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No pictures,please.

521
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's Vanity.

522
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:01,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Narcissist.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you guys doing here?

524
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Smurfette's been taken.

525
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Wait,what? - Taken? What do you mean "taken"?

526
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Smurf napped by that ghastly Gargamel.

527
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:10,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She was off alone because she thought we forgot her birthday.

528
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:13,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There was a misunderstanding.

529
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But if we can find him,we'll find her.

530
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:17,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,that shouldn't be hard. He's a big star now.

531
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He's in Paris. - I'll call the dog sitter.

532
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You get Blue's passport.

533
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:24,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes,a rescue mission. I'll come,too.

534
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:25,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You need all the help you can get.

535
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait a minute,Blue's passport?

536
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can't just up and go to Paris.

537
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At least,not all of us.

538
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:36,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay,so that's one vote no. Who votes yes?

539
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Me. - Of course.

540
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:43,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Daddy always loses.

541
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look,this is my Smurfette we're talking about. We have to go.

542
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:50,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If we're going to be traveling,let's make sure we do this properly.

543
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:54,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}La la la la,Sing a happy song.

544
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay,here we are. Victor,can you get Blue?

545
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:21,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- All right. We're all clear on the plan,right? - Yeah.

546
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll head over to Gargamel's show

547
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- and see if Smurfette's there. - Yes.

548
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:27,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I'll go to Gargamel's hotel and see if I can find out what room he's in.

549
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:29,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And,Victor,you and Blue can just check into the room here.

550
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:33,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Well,actually,I was thinking... - No. "Actually,I" nothing.

551
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You and Blue,upstairs.

552
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:35,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's the deal. End of story.

553
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:39,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}L'Opera House,s'il vous plait.

554
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My French is tres sexy,non?

555
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:45,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oui,maybe I'll get you a beret. - You cannot handle me in a beret.

556
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:48,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Is that what you think? I can't... - Hey!

557

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get a shroom.

558
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:53,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Good luck. - You,too.

559
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:54,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

560
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:59,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give him the formula.

561

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give him the formula.

562
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:04,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give him the formula.

563
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:07,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want to give it to him.

564
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll feel better about yourself

565
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:13,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if you stop being such an annoying little brat and give him the formula.

566
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:20,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Make her stop. It burns.

567

573
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you mean,I'm out of essence?

574
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can still do the show,all right.

576
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going to need a little snip.

577

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,no!

578
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:58,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just going to take a little off around the ears.

579

581
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:06,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your Papa is not coming because your real Papa is already here.

582

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,wait a minute,wait a minute.

612
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:03,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I asked for a shroud of mystery. This is a wisp!

613
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:06,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alakazatmosphere!

614
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Holy smurf!

615
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:12,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Where did that come from? - He's never had this much power before.

616
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:28,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,I am outraged!

617
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Positively outraged.

618
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry,who are you?

619
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:37,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am Monsieur Gargamel's manager,Madame Doolittle.

620
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:41,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is this outhouse you call a room?

621
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- The Napoleon Suite? - Napoleon Suite? Yes.

622
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But,Madame,this is the finest room in all the hotel.

623
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What could possibly...

624
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:50,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,for starters,darling,it's on the wrong floor.

625
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No one wants to be on the...

626
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:55,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- The fifth floor. - Yes. Yes,that's much too low.

627
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:01,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good evening! Good evening!

628
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay,guys,we're going in.

629
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:04,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,no,no.

630
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great.

631
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay,Papa,sneak out the back of my sweater

632
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:13,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}while I talk to this man who has no idea what I'm saying

633
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and go find that dressing room.

634
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:19,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is a great vacation,guys. I can feel the stress melting right off me.

635
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:22,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Don't spiral,Grouchy. - Yeah. We got this.

636
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:26,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Gentlemen,we have a cat problem. - Get down,get down.

637
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:29,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There! No,no,don't be alarmed.

638
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:32,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is how I treat all the critics.

639
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hurry,up those ropes.

640
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is Smurfette really worth all this?

641
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm just saying. - Let's go.

642
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:41,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Not permis. Not permis. - What? This is outrageous.

643
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:43,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your families will all pay dearly.

644
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:45,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As a result,some of you may die.

645
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,I'm sorry,you will need your key card.

646
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes,of course,darling,my key card!

647
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:08,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,dear,I've left it.

648
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:13,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oui,I was having breakfast at Tiffany's.

649
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:18,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll just go back and get it.

650
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:29,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I bet my glutes look great climbing up this rope.

651
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grouchy,take a look.

652
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:32,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hate my life.

653
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Clumsy! - Move it.

654
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:37,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...Interrupt my sorcery,at least I should be amused.

655
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:43,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now,you will all kindly hail to the great and exceedingly powerful Gargamel...

656
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:45,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing out here? How dare you?

657
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:49,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You smell something suspicious? Well,of course you do!

658
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:51,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've seen where you put your nose.

659
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now,get out of here.

660
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:53,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi,Daddy.

661
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:56,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Blue? - Yeah,yeah,yeah,just listen...

662
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:58,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Blue and I decided we can't let you run solo on this.

663
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can do this together.

664
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:03,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Three generations of proud Doyle men standing shoulder to shoulder.

665
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Even though we're all different heights and whatnot.

666
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are not Doyle men.

667
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Winslow-hyphen-Doyle.

668
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:12,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have a bee in your bonnet about the whole name thing.

669
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:13,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why do you chortle?

670
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:16,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Usually,in magic,the cats are big,no?

671
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like tiger or like lions,you know?

672
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:22,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Silence,knave! And allow me to oblige you.

673
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alakazanimal!

674
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Try not to smell delicious!

675
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So far,this is the worst trip of my life!

676
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I've only taken two!

677
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:42,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Look! There's Gargamel's dressing room. - Good eye,Vanity.

678
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:44,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please! He's got a star on his door.

679
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go.

680
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remind me to put a star on my mushroom when we get home.

681
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- If we ever want to be blue... - Blue.

682
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...we've got to come up with some way to get her talking.

683
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah. - Got any ideas?

684
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got it! Say "please."

685
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Never mind. I forgot you were you.

686
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- All right,here's my plan. - Okay.

687
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:06,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We trick her into acting like us,being naughty.

688
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Naughty,naughty!

689
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We use all her goodness against her.

690
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:14,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Once that happens,she'll feel like she's part of our family!

691
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Family! I like family!

692
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:17,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love this plan!

693
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh,no! - Broken family!

694
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:23,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Get her! - Catch her! Catch Smurfette!

695
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:25,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See you later,Smurfigators!

696
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Father's gonna kill us! Go faster!

697
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Au revoir,trolls! - Get her!

698
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hello? - Smurfette?

699
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Where are you? - Quick question.

700
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:37,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How is it we can't reach a doorknob,but we can get up here?

701
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,Clumsy,don't! No,no!

702
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:48,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You just lost a fight to an empty room.

703
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:51,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nobody wants to come up here

704
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:54,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and play with the larger kitty that they so annoyingly asked for!

705
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:55,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have to go! Now!

706
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:57,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah,soon as we get the Smurfette. - Yeah!

707
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He coughs up everything he eats. - You!

708
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:03,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Magic man,hand over the Smurfette.

709
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did you just say?

710
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You heard me.

711
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give me the Smurfette! Now!

00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How dare you? Alaka...

713
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Duck! - ...duck!

714
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Duck?

715
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:21,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was... up.

716
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

717
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:24,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You.

718
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}By great Merlin's beard,I remember you!

719
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We meet again,eh?

720
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:35,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Daddy's flying! Daddy's flying!

721
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:40,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,well,well,it appears we have a volunteer after all!

722
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Enough fooling around,yes? Open wide,Azrael.

723
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:50,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Put him down,Gargafella!

724
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:54,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Leave my son alone!

725
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll teach you to mess with us Doyle ducks!

726
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You again!

727
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:12,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing? Put me down!

728
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on,Blue.

729
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:16,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Put me down! I could have taken him! I had him!

730
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm afraid that's all the show we have time for.

731
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:22,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good bye.

732
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:24,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go on,get out,get out,get out.

733
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Smurfette's hair. She's been here.

734
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:29,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look! I found something.

735
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:31,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A portrait of perfection.

736
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Imagine how good you'd look if you were actually helping.

737
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:36,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't hate the player,hate the game.

738
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:38,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Smurfette? - Smurfette?

739
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:40,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey,is that coffee?

740
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:43,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anyone else want a cup o' joe?

741
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:46,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey,what's that?

742
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a mirror,you barbarian.

743
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Snap out of it,Vanity,and push!

744
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:54,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rage before beauty.

745
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:56,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whatever this is,it's making my butt scrunch.

746
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a little scary. I mean...

747
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gargamel!

748
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:07,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Clumsy! Are you trying to get us smurfed?

749
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:10,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's some sort of magic window.

750
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:12,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe it'll show us where Smurfette is.

751
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Naughties?

752
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:16,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Gargamel! - Quickly,pick it up.

753
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Quickly,to me,to me!

754
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Smurfette? Hello?

755
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:23,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where did you go? Hello?

756
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Move,Smurfs. - Here he comes. Hurry.

757
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:27,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Let's go! Let's go! - Where are you? Are you here?

758
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Children? Smurfette? - Back up,back up.

759
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:31,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Close the door! Close the door!

760
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:33,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your papa is back.

761
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Her papa?

762
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:37,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If this is a joke,I assure you I don't find it funny.

763
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hello? - Hold it!

764
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:44,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Are you down there,you little delinquents? - Keep still.

765
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:46,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They must have retreated back to the hotel.

766
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:52,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course we're running out of time.

767
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:55,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If that Patrick person is here,then Papa cannot be far behind.

768
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Quickly,to the hotel! We must get to her before he does.

769
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:04,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My face! My face!

770
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:07,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What? - It's gorgeous.

771
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:10,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We fell,and it wasn't even my fault!

772
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:13,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anyone? Anyone?

773
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:17,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,my Smurf.

774
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm scrunching again.

775
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:27,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Papa,what does this have to do with Smurfette?

776
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:29,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everything,I'm afraid.

777
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:33,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why would he build such a hideous device?

778
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:35,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that a giant Smurfalator?

779
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:37,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To extract our essence.

780
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:41,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are all those containers for?

781
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:44,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ninety-nine bottles of Smurf on the wall.

782
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:47,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So if Smurfette gives him the formula...

783
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:53,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He can turn as many Naughties into Smurfs as his greedy heart desires.

784
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:55,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guys?

785
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Total Smurf a geddon.

786
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,dear.

787
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Need a catch,please.

788
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This place really needs to recycle.

789
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:16,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Think,Smurfette,think. Oh,no!

790
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Where's Smurfette? Where's Smurfette? - There she is!

791
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:21,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's fast! I love this game!

792
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:25,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait! Let's let her run for a bit. She's got nowhere to go.

793
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- This is perfect for my plan! - Yeah,yeah.

794
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:30,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you so cross about? I'm the duck!

795
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:33,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You always barge in and ruin everything! You're like a walking disaster!

796
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey,look me in the eyes and say that.

797
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:38,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I can't. - That's right,because it's not true.

798
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,I can't because your eyes are on the sides of your head!

799
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:45,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All the better for me to see your disrespect!

800
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What are you looking at? - Hurry up.

801
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:50,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's global warming. Buy a Prius.

802
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:53,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Did I lose them?

803
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:58,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good dog.

804
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:02,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,no... Sorry. Excuse me.

805
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay,I got this.

806
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:19,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Papa,where are you?

807
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why am I not surprised the way out of Gargamel's lair is through a sewer?

808
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:25,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Master Winslow. - Papa!

809
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Patrick,look. - What happened?

810
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:30,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gargamel is hatching a terrible,terrible plan.

811
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's with the duck?

812
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's Victor. Gargamel turned him into a duck.

00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:57,060

820
00:42:57,310 --> 00:43:00,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go get yourself in trouble. Be naughty! I'll take care of the rest.

821

00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Leave me alone.

824
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:12,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You mean like your so-called Papa has?

825

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,he hasn't!

826
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:17,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He will come for me.

827
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:23,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He won't,because he knows you're where you really belong.

828
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:25,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't kidnap you,Smurfette.

829
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I brought you home.

830
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:32,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna make big trouble.

831

00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:21,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,no. I'm really in trouble now.

841
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:23,940

844
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Smurfette,what are we gonna do?

845
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:33,070

00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nice move,stealing a cart.

853
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't exactly steal it.

854
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Sorry! - Well,it's not yours,is it?

00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:01,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Naughty,naughty,naughty.

856
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:04,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See? You're just like us.

857
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:09,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How am I going to get Smurfette to give me that formula,Azrael?

858
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:12,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This whole thing just makes me want to...

859
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:15,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cry? No. Flush her down the toilet bowl.

860
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There must be something we can do.

861
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:20,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know you only have a tiny little pea-sized brain in there,but think!

862
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:24,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is it her birthday? Really? Who cares?

863
00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:28,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A present? A cake?

864
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:29,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Be nice to her?

865
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:37,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bribery and flattery to soften her stony little heart,eh?

866
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:40,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's counterintuitive,but that just might work.

867
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:43,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm so glad I thought of this!

868

870
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:49,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What kind of gift should I get her?

871
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:51,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Kitty,kitty,kitty! - Hey,fish breath!

00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not now,Azrael,I'm trying to think of

873
00:45:55,610 --> 00:45:58,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a genuine and heartfelt gift that I can deceive that Smurfette with!

874
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:00,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I said not now!

875
00:46:01,490 --> 00:46:05,040

00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:07,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are walking home.

877
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:10,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cats.

878
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:13,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Faster! Faster!

879
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:14,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse us! Sorry!

880
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:16,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How are we gonna stop this thing?

881
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:18,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think that's gonna be a problem!

882
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:21,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And she sticks the landing!

883
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:28,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yummy pudding! - Hackus,it's mud.

884
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:30,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yummy mud!

904
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:22,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stork going backwards! Stork going backwards!

00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- How did it go? - Couldn't have gone better.

909
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:42,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Except that everything was a complete smurftastrophe.

910
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:44,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's Smurfy's Law.

911

00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:52,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I borrowed a waiter's outfit for you,complete with a security card for the elevator.

913
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:53,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How did you manage that?

914
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:57,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's just say that the Plaza Athénée laundry room was paid a little visit

915
00:47:57,230 --> 00:48:01,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}by international apparel inspector Mademoiselle Doolittle.

916
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was like Meryl smurfin' Streep.

917
00:48:04,110 --> 00:48:05,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good job,Grace!

918
00:48:05,870 --> 00:48:08,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Does everyone get a new outfit,or just Patrick?

919
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:11,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Bloody window. - What was that?

920
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:12,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's Victor.

921
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:15,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They wouldn't let him through the lobby,so he flew up.

922
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No depth perception.

923
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grandpa Vicster is a duck!

924
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:22,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gargamel zapped him.

925
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:23,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can change him back,right?

926
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:26,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,but it's a transformation spell.

927
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It'll wear off eventually.

928
00:48:28,310 --> 00:48:30,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everybody relax. It's not a problem.

929
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But if you see me lay an egg,it's just between us.

930
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:36,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't seem too upset about this.

931
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:39,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not in a duck's nature to get upset.

932
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:41,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We like to let things roll off our backs.

933
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:44,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Seriously? You seriously just said that?

934
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I like that. That's very smurfy of you. - Very smurfy.

935
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:48,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why,thank you. See?

936
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:50,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The little Santa Claus Smurf appreciates me.

937
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:54,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe someday,Patrick,you'll learn to appreciate my smurfy qualities,too!

938
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. I've... There's... You know...

939
00:48:57,130 --> 00:48:58,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not having this conversation with a duck.

940
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:02,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now I'm catching a cold.

941
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:03,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wish I had a cold.

942
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:06,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've had Hefty's crystal shoved down my throat,

943
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:09,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}got attacked as a corn dog,fell down a sewer,

944
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:11,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and if that wasn't smelly enough,

945
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:15,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}had to travel by armpit just to find out we're all gonna be extinct!

946
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:20,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Holy smurf,I'm a downer. - You most certainly are.

947
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:22,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grouchy,the only way we'll be extinct

948
00:49:22,850 --> 00:49:25,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is if Smurfette gives Gargamel the secret formula.

949
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:27,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- But Smurfette would never tell. - Of course not.

950
00:49:28,070 --> 00:49:29,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Never. - Absolutely not.

951
00:49:29,370 --> 00:49:32,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Smurfette could never be tricked into being one of them.

952
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:34,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey,Smurfette.

953
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:37,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you do this with your sisters back in Smurf Village?

954
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:40,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lots of flying,but I never had a sister.

955
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:42,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,you do now.

956
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:45,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Want to race? - You want to race me?

957
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're in trouble now!

958
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:51,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm gonna lose you,Smurfette. - Not a chance.

959
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:03,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Watch out!

960
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:04,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold on tight,Hackus.

961
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:07,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Not that tight,Hackus. - Sorry.

962
00:50:07,950 --> 00:50:09,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stork fight!

963
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:12,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Coming through!

964
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is insane!

965
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:18,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Smurf,smurf,and away.

966
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hackus,king of world!

967
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:25,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're playing dirty now!

968
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:27,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just getting started.

969
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:28,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go,go!

970
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:31,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I call that a Crepe Smurfette.

971
00:50:32,850 --> 00:50:34,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Snails to go?

972
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:37,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Batter up! - Come on!

973
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:40,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hit me with your best shot.

974
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:43,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Snailed her!

975
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:46,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You are naughty,Smurfette. - Yeah.

976
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:53,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey! I've seen that lady before.

977
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:55,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's beautiful.

978
00:50:55,410 --> 00:50:58,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They've got one of these everywhere.

979
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:00,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna strangle that duck.

980
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:02,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Vic's like a black cloud that follows me around.

981
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay,look,I get it.

982
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:07,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you know what,he's here,isn't he?

983
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:08,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He shows up.

984
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:10,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah,whether you want him to or not.

985
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:13,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay,I always heard that showing up was 90% of the job.

986
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A lot of fathers don't even do that.

987
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's not my father.

988
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:19,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,that's too bad.

989
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:21,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}'Cause that pretty much leaves you without one.

990
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Patrick. - All right,guys.

991
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:38,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Come on. - Let's do this!

992
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:40,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm gonna stay with Blue. - And Vic.

993
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:43,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay,Smurfs,off to Gargamel's hotel.

994
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:44,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Patrick,there's actually something I'd like to...

995
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No "actuallys."

996
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:47,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're staying here.

997
00:51:47,590 --> 00:51:48,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not what I was even going...

998
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:50,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Victor,don't make me pluck you.

999
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Let's go. - Let's do it.

1000
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:56,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're gonna get Smurfette this time,100% guaranteed.

1001
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:57,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did you just say,Grouchy?

1002
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:03,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You heard it. I'm tired of being Grouchy. I am changing my tune to a happy one.

1003
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:05,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}From now on,lam...

1004
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:07,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ready? Positive Smurf.

1005
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:09,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I sprained my face.

1006
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:12,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll get used to it. Let's go,Smurfs.

1007
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:14,780

1117
00:58:13,310 --> 00:58:15,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think they're hugging.

1118
00:58:15,390 --> 00:58:16,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Papa?

1119
00:58:16,770 --> 00:58:18,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hackus love to hug.

1120
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:19,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hackus.

1121
00:58:19,850 --> 00:58:22,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Smurfette,come on,I got to show you something.

1122
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:27,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at us. Come on,tell me we're not family.

1123
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:30,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Smurfette!

1124
00:58:31,030 --> 00:58:32,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Over here!

1125
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Smurfette!

1126
00:58:33,370 --> 00:58:36,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry Papa Smurf didn't come for you.

1127
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:41,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But maybe your place is here with us.

1128
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:43,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

1129
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:45,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe it is.

1130
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:48,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why is she being nice to them?

1131
00:58:48,470 --> 00:58:52,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's just identifying with her captors. It's classic Smurf-holm syndrome.

1132
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:56,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,she thinks we don't care anymore,and they do.

1133
00:58:56,470 --> 00:58:57,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's confused.

1134
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:01,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Clumsy,Grouchy,get up there,and help me get this door open.

1135
00:59:01,230 --> 00:59:02,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That's my daughter in there! - Okay,Papa.

1136
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'll get on top. - Okay,Grouchy,you jump,I'll pull.

1137
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:08,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Come on,we can do this. - Children.

1138
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:11,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Gargamel! - Clumsy,don't let go...

1139
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:13,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Daddy's home.

1140
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:18,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And consistent with his kind nature,he brought you a present.

1141
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:19,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grouchy,get down. He'll see you.

1142
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:21,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- How are we gonna rescue her now? - Quiet.

1143
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:24,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I do believe we got off on the wrong foot earlier.

1144
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:25,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's happening?

1145
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:29,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Would you allow me to wish you a very,very happy birthday?

1146
00:59:30,630 --> 00:59:32,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It seems like only yesterday

1147
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:36,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you were just my little glob of clay and other putrid ingredients.

1148
00:59:36,810 --> 00:59:40,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You remembered my birthday?

1149
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course I did. We're family.

1150
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:44,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What? - But we're her family.

1151
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:47,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Families don't forget things like that. - Does she think we abandoned her?

1152
00:59:47,530 --> 00:59:51,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Speaking of which,your little blue step-papa never did arrive,now did he?

1153
00:59:51,150 --> 00:59:52,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Step-Papa?

1154
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:55,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why,I am truly sorry,my dear. That must really sting.

1155
00:59:57,370 --> 01:00:01,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I remember when my father threw me down the well for the first time.

1156
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:04,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The disappointed look on his face

1157
01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:07,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when I finally managed to claw my way out.

1158
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:12,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anyway,happy birthday,my dear.

1159
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:13,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Happy birthday,Smurfette! - Happy birthday,Smurfette!

1160
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:16,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I want to open! Let me open! - No,no,no.

1161
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:17,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ugly.

1162
01:00:22,190 --> 01:00:25,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Bow. Kneel. Worship me."

1163
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:30,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes,delightful rendition,really.

1164
01:00:30,610 --> 01:00:32,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keep it up,no-neck,I'll turn you into a cross-eyed newt.

1165
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:36,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes,yes,my dear.

1166
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:38,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go ahead,take it.

1167
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:42,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a tiny little magical wand of your very own.

1168
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:45,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go ahead. It's your birthday present.

1169
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:51,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

01:00:52,010 --> 01:00:53,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't do it.

1171
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:57,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you like it?

1172
01:00:58,890 --> 01:01:02,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Silly me. I've forgotten to turn it on.

1173

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here we are.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes,go ahead,try it out. Don't be afraid.

1176
01:01:15,910 --> 01:01:17,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- A Dragon Wand. - Oh,dear.

1178
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:24,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do you know I won't use it on you?

1179
01:01:25,460 --> 01:01:26,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well...

1180
01:01:26,670 --> 01:01:31,090

01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:57,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have always wanted to do this!

1189
01:02:00,990 --> 01:02:02,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're losing her.

1190

01:03:00,340 --> 01:03:02,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is a lot of white meat.

1209
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:04,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now panic!

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's Smurfette?

1217
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:35,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- She's... - Where's Smurfette?

1218
01:03:36,050 --> 01:03:38,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We were too late.

1219
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:42,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nice going.

1220
01:03:45,470 --> 01:03:49,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have fun,children. Just remember,be kind to each other.

1221
01:03:49,850 --> 01:03:52,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will you get away from me,you bumbling moron?

1222
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:53,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Where are they? - What?

1223
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:56,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Smurfs were here? In this room? Why didn't you say so?

1224
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:58,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right now!

1225
01:04:00,530 --> 01:04:01,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She must not learn of this.

1226
01:04:01,950 --> 01:04:06,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We must spirit her away from here and get that formula now.

1227
01:04:07,370 --> 01:04:10,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Smurfette,my dear,are you ready to go celebrate?

1228
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:12,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah! - Come on,come on. This'll be fun.

1229
01:04:14,290 --> 01:04:15,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We were this close to getting Smurfette back.

1230
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:16,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know.

1231
01:04:16,590 --> 01:04:19,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He distracted me at the worst possible moment,Grace.

1232
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:21,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I would have been in the elevator if it wasn't for him.

1233
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:24,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay,okay,use your indoor voice,and please,Patrick,just breathe.

1234
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:25,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want him gone.

1235
01:04:25,930 --> 01:04:28,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He's your dad. - No,that's one thing he is not.

1236
01:04:28,810 --> 01:04:31,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's right,Grace. I'm not his father.

1237
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:34,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His real father left and started a new family.

1238
01:04:35,770 --> 01:04:37,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's been chewed up about it ever since.

1239
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:40,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Excuse me? - As well you might.

1240
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:43,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I can't take the brunt of it anymore.

1241
01:04:44,030 --> 01:04:47,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey,I never asked for you to come barging into my life,okay?

1242
01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:51,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't ask you to marry my mother or take away Zeus.

1243
01:04:51,870 --> 01:04:54,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Zeus? The pigeon?

1244
01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:56,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The parrot.

1245
01:04:56,330 --> 01:04:57,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My parrot.

1246
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Taken away because you were allergic.

1247
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:06,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was not allergic to that bird,Patrick.

1248
01:05:06,340 --> 01:05:07,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes,you were.

1249
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:10,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,I wasn't.

1250
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:11,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were.

1251
01:05:12,310 --> 01:05:13,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

1252
01:05:13,850 --> 01:05:17,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It got so bad,every day,you were wheezing,coughing.

1253
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:19,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your mother and I both knew that it would break your heart

1254
01:05:19,650 --> 01:05:22,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to think the bird had to go away because of you.

1255
01:05:22,490 --> 01:05:24,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You already blamed yourself for your dad.

1256
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:26,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I took the heat.

1257
01:05:26,950 --> 01:05:30,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a lie. What are you... I'm not allergic to birds.

1258
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:32,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay,tell you what.

1259
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:34,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sniff my feathers.

1260
01:05:34,870 --> 01:05:37,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm not going to... - Come on,sniff them.

1261
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:45,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Truth itches,doesn't it?

1262
01:05:49,890 --> 01:05:51,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen to me,Patrick.

1263
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:54,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I loved your mother with all my heart.

1264
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:57,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I took care of Jeannette,and I made her happy.

1265
01:05:58,060 --> 01:06:00,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I also chose to love you as my own.

1266
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:02,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now,I didn't have to do that.

1267
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:07,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you were this little kid,no father,no hope in his eyes,a big hole in his heart,

1268
01:06:07,820 --> 01:06:09,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so I gave you everything I could.

1269
01:06:10,070 --> 01:06:11,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I'm done,you know?

1270
01:06:11,990 --> 01:06:14,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't want it,that's fine.

1271
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My last word of advice to you is this...

1272
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will you grow up?

1273
01:06:19,830 --> 01:06:22,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop blaming everyone else for your pain.

1274
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And whatever you do,

1275
01:06:24,090 --> 01:06:27,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}don't teach that beautiful son of yours that love is conditional,

1276
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because it is not.

1277
01:06:31,550 --> 01:06:33,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good bye,Grace.

1278
01:06:38,190 --> 01:06:40,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bye-bye,Blue.

1279
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:51,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grandpa Vicster.

1280
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:56,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bye.

1281
01:06:59,790 --> 01:07:01,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Goodbye,Patrick Winslow.

1282
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:14,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at that big wheel.

1283
01:07:14,510 --> 01:07:17,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come. Come along,my dear.

1284
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:20,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So this is why they call it the City of Light.

1285
01:07:21,770 --> 01:07:23,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a lot of people.

1286
01:07:23,650 --> 01:07:25,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes,well...

1287
01:07:25,610 --> 01:07:28,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I prefer to call them "worshippers."

1288
01:07:28,940 --> 01:07:30,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Worshippers."

1289
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:32,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alakakneel!

1290
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:37,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bow. Kneel.

1291
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:39,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hackus.

1292
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:41,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Shall we? - Let's go.

1293
01:07:41,620 --> 01:07:45,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry. Everyone likes it. He's a celebrity. Come on.

1294
01:07:46,090 --> 01:07:47,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

1295
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes,hello. It's me.

1296
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:52,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- These are my children. - Hi.

1297
01:07:52,510 --> 01:07:54,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Who's that? - That's my brother.

1298

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi. I'm Hackus.

1299
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:57,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at that. It's a magical creature.

1300
01:07:58,310 --> 01:07:59,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi.

1301
01:07:59,850 --> 01:08:01,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's my birthday.

1302
01:08:01,770 --> 01:08:02,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

1303
01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:05,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I have a FASTPASS. - Yeah,FASTPASS.

1304

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Monsieur Gargamel!

1305
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:10,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you for keeping our seats warm. Goodbye.

1306

01:08:15,070 --> 01:08:17,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Monsieur Gargamel! Monsieur Gargamel!

1309
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:20,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go!

1310
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Father. - Not now.

1311
01:08:22,330 --> 01:08:23,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's feeding time soon.

1312
01:08:23,830 --> 01:08:25,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Not now! - But...

1313

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here we are.

1314

1315

1316
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:45,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But isn't this lovely,my dear?

1317
01:08:45,940 --> 01:08:47,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And just think,

1318
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:52,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with your secret formula and my incredible magic,

1319
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:56,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}there's absolutely nothing that we cannot do.

1320
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:59,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

1321
01:08:59,370 --> 01:09:02,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Think of all the fun we could have,Smurfette.

1322
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:09,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

1323
01:09:09,340 --> 01:09:12,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then why are we going so slow?

1324
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:34,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Look out! - Yeah!

1325
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:36,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Isn't this fun?

1326
01:09:36,570 --> 01:09:38,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Decidedly not!

1327
01:09:48,540 --> 01:09:52,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Best ride ever! Smurfette's fun,huh?

1328
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Incoming!

1329
01:10:00,550 --> 01:10:03,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look out! Coming through!

1330
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:07,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry!

1331
01:10:24,450 --> 01:10:26,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I must have failed her.

1332
01:10:27,580 --> 01:10:30,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry. I was looking for a place to think.

1333
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:33,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,no,no,no. It's okay.

1334
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:36,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was doing a little thinking myself.

1335
01:10:39,930 --> 01:10:42,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Master Winslow,it's hard for me,

1336
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:46,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but,well,can I ask you some advice?

1337
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean,papa to Papa.

1338
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:51,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's about Smurfette.

1339
01:10:52,150 --> 01:10:53,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know what to do.

1340
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:56,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I turned her blue.

1341
01:10:56,190 --> 01:10:58,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I taught her love and kindness.

1342
01:10:59,110 --> 01:11:01,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But the truth is,Gargamel made her.

1343
01:11:02,070 --> 01:11:06,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's only a Smurf as long as she chooses to be.

1344
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:08,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But what if she doesn't?

1345
01:11:10,210 --> 01:11:12,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What if she chooses him?

1346
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:14,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We could lose her.

1347
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:16,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We may have already.

1348
01:11:18,590 --> 01:11:20,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I haven't done enough.

1349
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:21,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you kidding?

1350
01:11:21,930 --> 01:11:24,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gargamel just made her,but you,

1351
01:11:24,390 --> 01:11:25,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you made her what she is.

1352
01:11:25,850 --> 01:11:28,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You stepped in and loved her as your very own.

1353
01:11:29,020 --> 01:11:31,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No one asked you to,you just did.

1354
01:11:31,350 --> 01:11:33,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because you knew she needed that.

1355
01:11:33,690 --> 01:11:35,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that's a...

1356
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:41,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a pretty special kind of love.

1357
01:11:44,530 --> 01:11:46,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's way too smart not to see that.

1358
01:11:49,370 --> 01:11:50,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're right.

1359
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:53,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We didn't believe in her because she changed.

1360
01:11:53,790 --> 01:11:56,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She changed because we believed in her.

1361
01:11:57,960 --> 01:11:59,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you,Master Winslow.

1362
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:03,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was exactly what I needed to hear.

1363
01:12:11,890 --> 01:12:13,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Me,too.

1364
01:12:15,610 --> 01:12:17,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just a few more bubbles.

1365
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:18,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How's that?

1366
01:12:18,980 --> 01:12:22,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sweet Smurf in Heaven,what have you eaten?

1367
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:25,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's okay. Every time a Smurf toots,someone smiles.

1368
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:27,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Let's go,Smurfs. - Where?

1369
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're getting Smurfette.

1370
01:12:29,410 --> 01:12:31,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you saw her,Papa.

1371
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:33,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's one of them now.

1372
01:12:33,250 --> 01:12:35,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- A horse whisperer? - No!

1373
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:37,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- A French Socialist? - No!

1374
01:12:37,130 --> 01:12:38,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A Flying Wallenda!

1375
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:40,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,she's with Gargamel. Keep up.

1376
01:12:40,340 --> 01:12:42,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't care what we saw.

1377
01:12:42,090 --> 01:12:44,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You never give up on family.

1378
01:12:44,510 --> 01:12:46,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah,Papa's right.

1379
01:12:46,510 --> 01:12:48,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who are you,and what have you done with Grouchy?

1380
01:12:48,890 --> 01:12:51,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey,I'm Positive,remember?

1381
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right,Smurfs. Let's get smurfing.

1382
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:57,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Master Winslow,you coming with us?

1383
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:58,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is a Smurf's butt blue?

1384
01:13:01,190 --> 01:13:02,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You tell me.

1385
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:04,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grouchy.

1386
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:07,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Put it away. - Anybody else?

1387
01:13:07,660 --> 01:13:09,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay,then. Out of the tub with you.

1388
01:13:09,830 --> 01:13:10,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We've got work to do. - Hey.

1389
01:13:10,990 --> 01:13:13,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's smurf this mushroom stand. Let's roll.

1390
01:13:13,210 --> 01:13:15,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah,guys,let's do this.

1391
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:25,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Victor? Hey.

1392
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:56,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay,Master Winslow,we'll split up here.

1393
01:13:56,210 --> 01:13:58,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. I'll find the electrical room and cut the power.

1394
01:13:58,500 --> 01:13:59,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And we'll find Smurfette.

1395
01:13:59,580 --> 01:14:01,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And we'll all look fabulous doing it.

1396
01:14:02,050 --> 01:14:03,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,come on.

1397
01:14:03,420 --> 01:14:05,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Team building. Hello!

1398
01:14:05,550 --> 01:14:08,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right,see you inside. Good luck.

1399
01:14:08,180 --> 01:14:10,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Come on,guys. - lnto the belly of the beast.

1400
01:14:12,350 --> 01:14:14,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are we coming down here,Father?

1401
01:14:14,730 --> 01:14:18,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,we are celebrating your long-lost sister's birthday.

1402
01:14:18,770 --> 01:14:19,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really?

1403
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:22,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can't very well end the festivities without

1404
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:25,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a cake.

1405
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:29,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I made you your favourite,my dear. Blue velvet.

1406
01:14:31,370 --> 01:14:32,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cake.

1407
01:14:33,580 --> 01:14:36,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go ahead. Go ahead. Make a wish,my dear.

1408
01:14:36,710 --> 01:14:41,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anything your tiny little heart can dream of,and it is yours.

1409
01:14:41,590 --> 01:14:43,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anything?

1410
01:14:43,130 --> 01:14:44,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But of course.

1411
01:14:45,210 --> 01:14:46,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes,well,within reason.

1412
01:14:46,970 --> 01:14:51,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm afraid we're on a bit of an essence budget around here lately.

1413
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:54,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's why we need the formula,you see.

1414
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:03,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There she is.

1415
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:05,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that a birthday cake?

1416
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:07,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We had a birthday cake for her,too.

1417
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:09,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She just never saw it.

1418
01:15:09,910 --> 01:15:12,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They look like a happy family.

1419
01:15:12,950 --> 01:15:15,290

1420
01:15:15,370 --> 01:15:18,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If she does,it would mean the end of all Smurf kind.

1421
01:15:20,580 --> 01:15:22,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait. Even the handsome ones?

1422
01:15:22,790 --> 01:15:24,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah. - Vanity,you come with me.

01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:27,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Clumsy and Grouchy,go meet Master Winslow.

1424
01:15:38,390 --> 01:15:40,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Victor,what are you doing here?

1425
01:15:40,270 --> 01:15:41,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grace called me.

1426
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She said you might need a hand.

1427
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:48,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,no. Victor,wait.

1428
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:51,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As usual,Grace is right.

1429
01:15:52,860 --> 01:15:53,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I could use some help.

1430
01:15:54,490 --> 01:15:57,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,for starters,you might try lifting the sewer cover.

1431
01:15:57,740 --> 01:15:59,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Unless you're planning on fixing the phone lines?

1432
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:06,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Smurfette,the formula?

1433
01:16:07,050 --> 01:16:08,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take all the time you need,my dear.

1434
01:16:09,090 --> 01:16:10,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As long as it's very,very soon.

1435
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:13,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then we can all be blue. Together.

1436
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:17,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hackus blue. Hackus blue.

1437
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:19,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see? They want to be blue,

1438
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:21,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}just like their big sister.

1439
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:24,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then we could be a real family.

1440
01:16:29,070 --> 01:16:30,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is something.

1441
01:16:31,070 --> 01:16:35,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A sacred gift entrusted to me.

01:16:44,210 --> 01:16:45,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't.

1445
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:50,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you mean,you can't?

1446
01:16:51,010 --> 01:16:52,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've given you everything.

01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:57,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a cake with no poison. It's been horrible!

1449
01:16:57,850 --> 01:17:00,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now,I have had just about enough of this,young lady.

1450
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:03,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are going to give me what I want right now!

1451

01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:13,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's happening to them?

1456
01:17:14,150 --> 01:17:15,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So dizzy.

1457
01:17:15,490 --> 01:17:18,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't tell me you actually care for these pathetic creatures.

1458
01:17:19,030 --> 01:17:20,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How sad for you.

01:18:06,210 --> 01:18:08,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's the point? You won't give me the formula,

1476
01:18:08,830 --> 01:18:12,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so,well,I might as well just let them go.

01:18:15,550 --> 01:18:18,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You mean you'd let them die?

1479

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're blue! We're Smurfs!

1521
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:49,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It worked. All the world is mine!

1522
01:20:49,660 --> 01:20:52,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I can make my own Smurfs! - No!

1523
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:56,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've been betrayed.

1524
01:20:57,090 --> 01:20:59,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Finally,finally.

1525
01:20:59,380 --> 01:21:01,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're a real boy.

1526
01:21:01,420 --> 01:21:02,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm blue.

1527
01:21:02,590 --> 01:21:04,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now into the machine with all of you.

1528
01:21:04,630 --> 01:21:05,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Father,no.

1529
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:10,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No cage for Hackus. No cage for Hackus. - All right,all right.

1530
01:21:11,220 --> 01:21:13,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- In you go. - No cage for Hackus!

1531
01:21:13,180 --> 01:21:15,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Everybody gets their own room. - Please!

1532
01:21:15,690 --> 01:21:18,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I failed her,Vanity. - Papa,wait.

1533
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:21,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think I can reach that pin.

1534
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:22,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good idea,Vanity.

1535
01:21:22,990 --> 01:21:24,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on,come on.

1536
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:26,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Father,please.

1537
01:21:26,740 --> 01:21:28,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now,don't go anywhere.

1538
01:21:30,580 --> 01:21:33,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You face leaking.

1539
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:37,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hackus leaking.

1540
01:21:38,590 --> 01:21:41,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hackus leaking.

1541
01:21:41,300 --> 01:21:46,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You sacrificed everything just to save us.

1542
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:48,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I had to.

1543
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:49,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I care about you.

1544
01:21:51,970 --> 01:21:53,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're family.

1545
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:56,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No like leaking.

1546
01:21:56,980 --> 01:21:58,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hackus like blue.

1547
01:21:58,900 --> 01:22:01,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What a sickening scene.

1548
01:22:01,150 --> 01:22:03,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd be completely nauseated if this weren't

1549
01:22:04,030 --> 01:22:06,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the happiest moment of my life!

1550
01:22:07,070 --> 01:22:09,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Try the lever,the big one. - Get on my shoulders.

1551
01:22:09,370 --> 01:22:10,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hurry,lads.

1552
01:22:10,910 --> 01:22:11,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Which way do I go?

1553
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:13,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Try negative. That might shut it off.

1554
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:16,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Negative? Nah. I'm all about positive.

1555
01:22:20,170 --> 01:22:21,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There.

1556
01:22:21,290 --> 01:22:25,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One small step for a wizard,

1557
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:28,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}one giant leap for... What?

1558
01:22:29,590 --> 01:22:30,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Positive!

1559
01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:33,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Too much smurf berry cobbler.

1560
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grouchy!

1561
01:22:34,850 --> 01:22:37,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes,I said you could press the button,didn't I?

1562
01:22:40,230 --> 01:22:42,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grouchy!

1563
01:22:42,270 --> 01:22:44,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I lied. One giant leap for me!

1564
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:50,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just got fried.

1565
01:22:50,820 --> 01:22:53,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hard to put a positive spin on that.

1566
01:22:58,370 --> 01:22:59,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Son of a Smurf!

1567
01:22:59,710 --> 01:23:00,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hurry,Vanity.

1568
01:23:00,790 --> 01:23:04,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Narcissism is about to save the day.

1569
01:23:04,550 --> 01:23:05,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Got it! - Smurftastic work.

1570
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:07,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I knew it. - Now go.

1571
01:23:07,090 --> 01:23:08,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What? - Go!

1572
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:09,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come,Azrael!

1573
01:23:10,010 --> 01:23:14,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Apparently,we must harness the power of the skies one final time.

1574
01:23:14,390 --> 01:23:15,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why does this have to be so Les Misérables?

1575
01:23:15,890 --> 01:23:18,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Let's go. - Look at me,all rough-and-tumble.

1576
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:20,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm like Commando Smurf.

1577
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:21,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hooah!

1578
01:23:22,810 --> 01:23:25,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are right. Commandos are quiet and stealthy.

1579
01:23:25,570 --> 01:23:26,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hooah!

1580
01:23:27,030 --> 01:23:28,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- There she is! - Smurfette.

1581
01:23:29,570 --> 01:23:30,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Santa!

1582
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:34,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Papa? You... You came for me.

1583
01:23:34,450 --> 01:23:37,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,of course we came for you. You're my daughter.

1584
01:23:37,870 --> 01:23:39,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Was there ever a question?

1585
01:23:39,790 --> 01:23:41,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No,it's locked. - Go on through.

1586
01:23:41,580 --> 01:23:42,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We'll find another way. - Okay.

1587
01:23:42,750 --> 01:23:45,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll see you in there,Master Winslow. Hurry!

1588
01:23:48,630 --> 01:23:49,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here.

1589
01:23:50,550 --> 01:23:51,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold this!

1590
01:24:08,650 --> 01:24:09,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Papa.

1591
01:24:09,940 --> 01:24:12,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,my dear.

1592
01:24:12,780 --> 01:24:16,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Papa,I gave Gargamel the formula.

1593
01:24:16,660 --> 01:24:18,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But she saved our lives.

1594
01:24:18,370 --> 01:24:20,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hackus live! Hackus live!

1595
01:24:20,910 --> 01:24:23,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Papa,I let you down.

1596
01:24:24,630 --> 01:24:27,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I betrayed the Smurfs.

1597
01:24:27,130 --> 01:24:28,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm so sorry.

1598
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:33,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Smurfette,life is the most precious thing to protect.

1599
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:35,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm very proud of you.

1600
01:24:35,970 --> 01:24:37,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You... You are?

1601
01:24:38,140 --> 01:24:41,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Seriously? No spanking? No smack to the knuckles?

1602
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:43,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You forgive her,just like that?

1603
01:24:43,390 --> 01:24:46,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course. We rise to the amount of love we're shown,

1604
01:24:46,810 --> 01:24:50,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and we sink only when that love stops.

1605
01:24:50,190 --> 01:24:53,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hackus leaking again. Leaking again!

1606
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:55,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey,you found Smurfette!

1607
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:57,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello.

1608
01:24:58,580 --> 01:24:59,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi.

1609
01:25:01,540 --> 01:25:02,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,no,we don't have much time.

1610
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:06,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's just get the formula back and get out of here. Hooah!

1611
01:25:06,330 --> 01:25:07,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait! What about them?

1612
01:25:08,090 --> 01:25:10,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about them? They kidnapped you.

1613
01:25:10,130 --> 01:25:11,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah,they're Gargamel's.

1614
01:25:11,510 --> 01:25:16,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So was I,but Papa never gave up on me.

1615
01:25:16,140 --> 01:25:18,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I'm not about to give up on them.

1616
01:25:19,140 --> 01:25:21,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you thought you weren't a real Smurf.

1617
01:25:22,770 --> 01:25:24,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Get them out,quickly. - Right,Papa.

1618

1619
01:25:26,190 --> 01:25:28,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then there were seven,eh?

1620
01:25:29,820 --> 01:25:31,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello,kitty.

1621
