00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:01,600
上溯至宇宙初始  周遭还只是一片漆黑
In the beginning, there was darkness,

10
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:05,010
不知何时  忽地一声巨响  
and then--Bang--giving birth to

11
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:06,520
时间空间以及物质皆由此发端
an endless expanding existence

12
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,810
此后不断膨胀  延伸  永无止境
of time, space, and matter.

13
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,740
每一天  新的发现都在不断为我们解开
Every day, new discoveries are unlocking

14
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,810
蕴藏于这里的那些神秘莫测
the mysterious, the mind-blowing,

15
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:15,470
令人大开眼界  致命的秘密
the deadly secrets of

16
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:18,720
我们称这个地方为"宇宙"
a place we call the universe.

17
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,960
我们的太阳是否有一颗邪恶伴星呢
Could our Sun have an evil companion?

18
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,120
是否有这样一颗未被发现的死星
An undiscovered death star

19
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,160
在最遥远的太阳系边界处旋转  徘徊
rotating at the furthest edges of the Solar System?

20
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:33,660
这颗神秘的恒星是否每隔一段时间
Does this mysterious star scatter destruction

21
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,210
就为太阳系埋带来毁灭性的灾难
through the Solar System at regular intervals,

22
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:40,450
它是否造成了地球史上最大规模的灭绝呢
accounting for the greatest extinctions in Earth's history?

23
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,450
科学家敏锐的目光穿过这个充斥着巨恒星
Sifting through a realm populated by giant worlds

24
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:49,020
以及神秘的小恒星的地带  去搜寻
and mysterious planetoids, scientists are on the hunt

25
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,410
太阳的邪恶双子星  涅墨西斯
for Nemesis...The Sun's evil twin.

26
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,080
我们头顶上闪烁的数以亿万计的群星之中
Of the billions of stars twinkling overhead,

27
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:13,490
有一颗也许会使地球上生灵涂炭
one may be a scourge to life on Earth...

28
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,890
它就是太阳的邪恶双子星  涅墨西斯
An evil twin to the Sun named Nemesis.

29
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:23,250
有些科学家怀疑  涅墨西斯是一颗
Some scientists suspect that Nemesis is

30
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,340
不发光且尚未发现的围绕太阳转动的恒星
a dark, still-undiscovered star orbiting our Sun.

31
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,940
而每过两千六百万年
And every 26 million years,

32
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,980
它就会带来一场灾难
it triggers a disaster.

33
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:35,730
大家都知道  太阳系的周围
We know that the Solar System

34
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,120
环绕着巨大的彗星团
is surrounded by this enormous cloud of comets,

35
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,260
格雷格・洛格林
加利福尼亚大学圣塔克鲁兹分校

36
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:43,030
因此太阳伴星这一系列运动产生的轨迹
and so these successive passages of the Sun's companion

37
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,960
将会把一些彗星带入太阳系的内部
would send comets into the inner Solar System.

38
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:48,020
它们有可能撞击地球
Some of them will hit Earth.

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,430
而一旦撞击发生  地球将生灵涂炭
What follows is death on a colossal scale.

40
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,720
现在普遍的理论是  在六千五百万年前
It is now widely accepted that a rock from space

41
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:10,490
一块来自太空的岩石结束了恐龙时代
caused the end of the age of dinosaurs 65 million years ago.

42
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,010
我们现在已有十足的把握认定
So we now are pretty convinced that

43
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,670
六千五百万年前的那场
the reason that a huge fraction of life on the Earth

44
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,710
令地球大部分物种灭绝的灾难
went extinct 65 million years ago

45
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:19,430
麦克・布朗
加利福尼亚理工学院

46
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:22,810
是由于一颗彗星撞击地球而造成的
was because a comet slammed into the Earth.

47
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:32,250
但天文学家理查德・穆勒却提出了
But astronomer Richard Muller has proposed

48
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,180
一套革命性的理论  以解释为何彗星
a revolutionary theory to explain why that space rock

49
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,010
会恰巧在那一时刻撞击地球
crashed to Earth at that particular moment.

50
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:43,200
涅墨西斯理论描述了这一假想
The Nemesis theory postulates that

51
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,220
即  有一颗恒星在做绕日运动
there's a star orbiting the Sun

52
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,820
理查德・穆勒
美国劳伦斯伯克利国家实验室

53
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,110
而其公转周期为两千六百万年
at a 26-million-year period.

54
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,020
足矣
That's about it.

55
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:55,030
几乎不需要其它假说来支持此理论了
Almost no other assumptions need to be made.

56
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:00,000
穆勒认为当涅墨西斯运行到太阳附近时
Muller believes that as Nemesis nears the Sun,

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,950
它所带来的引力扰乱
its gravitational disturbance

58
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,910
会使得一些彗星穿越太阳系
sends comets flying through the Solar System.

59
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,390
这种现象的后果就是造成地球历史上
The resulting impacts have been the source of

60
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,620
多次大规模物种灭绝现象的元凶
many major extinction events in Earth's history.

61
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,730
穆勒这样解释他的理论是如何诞生的
Muller explains how the theory came about.

62
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,810
有两位古生物学者
Two paleontologists,

63
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,720
在研究地球生物灭绝的规律时
when looking at patterns of extinctions,

64
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,760
发现了一件似乎十分不可思议的事情
came across something that seemed utterly insane.

65
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:30,270
他们说  这种类似的灭绝现象
They said that similar extinctions were taking place

66
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:34,600
大约每两千六百万年就要发生一次
every 26 million years on a regular schedule.

67
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:39,660
任何地球本身的现象都似乎都无法解释
The discovery of a 26-million-year pattern of extinctions

68
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:46,370
这个每两千六百万年的物种灭绝规律
seemed impossible to explain by any process native to the Earth itself.

69
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,320
这可是科学家们梦寐以求的事情
This is the sort of thing you dream about in science.

70
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,900
因为这说明有些事物对我们还是未知
It means there's something we don't understand.

71
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,590
说明有未知的事物亟待发现
It means there's a discovery waiting.

72
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:56,950
于是  我便试图去探求那未解之谜
So I set about trying to figure out what that was.

73
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,900
穆勒提出了一个惊人的假说
Muller made an astonishing proposal.

74
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,570
这些周期性灭绝现象的唯一合理解释就是
The only logical cause of these periodic extinctions

75
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:11,260
有一颗潜恒星  它每两千六百万年饶太阳一周
is a cosmic stalker that orbits our Sun every 26 million years,

76
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,130
而每一接近太阳就会造成彗星轨道的紊乱
disturbing the comets on each approach.

77
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:18,150
总之  它是一颗太阳的死亡伴星
In short, a death star companion to our Sun.

78
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,490
如果真的发现这颗恒星  将是意义深远的
If this star is discovered, it is so important.

79
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:30,450
它在地球上生物进化过程中起到了重要作用
It was a major player in the evolution of life on Earth.

80
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:34,890
若不是这颗恒星  也许恐龙还在称霸地球
Without this, perhaps the dinosaurs would still be here.

81
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,170
如果穆勒所言属实
If Muller is right,

82
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:40,370
那么人类之所以能够出现在地球上
humanity itself could owe its existence

83
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,650
还是多亏了这颗名叫涅墨西斯的死星
to the Nemesis death star.

84
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:48,600
毕竟每次大规模灭绝都清除了大量物种
After all, each mass extinction wiped out vast numbers of species,

85
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,370
但这也为新物种的出现和繁衍开辟了道路
but each also cleared the way for new species to arise,

86
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,280
其中就包括  最后出现的人类
including, ultimately, humans.

87
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,570
通过在加州的圣塔罗莎高原的可控火灾
We can witness the way Nemesis would have altered evolution on Earth

88
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:07,760
我们便知道涅墨西斯是如何影响地球生物进化的
by looking at a controlled burn on the Santa rosa plateau in California.

89
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,700
灭顶之灾不时降临在地球上
So every now and again, some cataclysmic event happens

90
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:16,680
克利福德・强森
南加州大学

91
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,280
并将地球上的大量物种一扫而空
that wipes out a huge number of species here on Earth.

92
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,650
就像这些可控火灾一样
And this is just like happens with these controlled burns,

93
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,690
当大火清除了一些物种
where the burn wipes out a number of species,

94
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,890
同时也为新的生命提供了生存的空间
which then makes room for new things to take hold.

95
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,520
我看到火焰在我们身后迅速蔓延
So I'm seeing a fire raging behind us.

96
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,610
你们在做什么
What's going on there?

97
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,110
为什么要放火呢
Why do you light fires?

98
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,340
我们在这里放火
We're out here setting this fire

99
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,670
是为了将这一片植被清理干净
to clear part of this vegetation away,

100
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:43,970
为了将外来的植物清除
to get rid of the non-native species of plants

101
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,700
好让本地植物得以从新回归
that are growing here so the native can grow back.

102
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,880
每年我们都会来到这里
We come here and burn annually

103
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,680
焚烧不同区域  以便进行分析比较
in different plots of land so that it can be studied,

104
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,310
我们还能够借此了解其对于环境的影响
and we can also see the impact it's having on that environment.

105
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,530
这次计划烧除展示了
A prescribed fire mimics the kinds of

106
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:06,260
涅墨西斯所能带来的大规模物种灭绝现象
mass extinctions that Nemesis may have caused.

107
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,300
很多物种就此消失
Many species are swept away,

108
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:15,970
但幸存物种则有空间得以繁衍  不断进化
but the destruction leaves room for the survivors to flourish and evolve...

109
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,800
譬如说  当恐龙突然灭绝后
Just as mammals survived and thrived

110
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,070
哺乳动物幸存下来且日益壮大
after the fiery death of the dinosaurs,

111
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,240
从而为人类的进化奠定了基础
setting the stage for human evolution.

112
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:35,000
每年在圣塔罗莎都有计划烧除
These prescribed fires return to Santa rosa every year

113
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,190
这种现象仿效了
and imitate the driving motivation

114
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,830
涅墨西斯理论的提出诱因
behind the creation of the Nemesis hypothesis--

115
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:44,560
即灭绝是不断发生的
that extinctions occur over and over.

116
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:48,510
对于这些有规律的物种灭绝
There are really only two viable explanations

117
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,970
只有两种合理的解释
for the regularity of the extinctions.

118
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,120
其中一种就是涅墨西斯理论
One of them is the Nemesis theory.

119
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,770
而另一种解释就是机缘巧合
The other is that by the throw of the dice

120
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,840
那些灭顶之灾只不过是
they just accidentally happen to

121
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,980
恰巧每两千六百万年发生一次
line up every 26 million years.

122
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:06,480
但涅墨西斯究竟是如何做到如此精准地
But how, exactly, would Nemesis trigger extinctions

123
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,470
有规律地造成"计划烧除"呢
with the regularity of a prescribed burn?

124
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,110
在太阳系中一个名为奥尔特云的区域
The possible answer lies in a region of the Solar System

125
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:16,710
也许能找到我们想要的答案
known as the Oort Cloud.

126
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:26,800
奥尔特云是大量彗星的"冷藏室"
The Oort Cloud is the place where comets are kept in cold storage

127
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,730
直到它们有一天向着太阳呼啸而过
until they come screaming in towards the Sun.

128
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:32,280
就是说  那些彗星都冷冻在奥尔特云中
So these things are sitting in deep freeze,

129
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:36,580
它们大概位于为我们与最近恒星的中间
sort of at the distance halfway between us and the nearest stars.

130
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,990
奥尔特云中的大多数彗星
The vast majority of Oort Cloud comets

131
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:47,880
都在距离太阳远达一光年的安全距离环绕
orbit at the safe distance of up to one light year from the Sun.

132
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,500
除非有什么东西打乱了它们的轨道
That is, unless something disturbs their orbits.

133
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:56,940
有时  一颗恒星运行到奥尔特云处
Occasionally, a star will come by,

134
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,550
便会稍微推撞一下这些彗星
and they get a little bit jostled.

135
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:01,000
但是这轻微的推撞却意义重大
And a little jostling can do a lot of things.

136
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,040
它能让彗星完全脱离太阳引力
It can make them go away and leave the Sun entirely.

137
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,220
或轻微改变它们的运行的轨道
It can put them on a slightly different orbit.

138
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:09,010
还有一个可能  就是使他们慢慢
But one of the things it can do is put them on an orbit that

139
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:11,860
改变到朝太阳运行的轨道中
slowly falls in toward the Sun.

140
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,740
通过观察杂耍者的动作
By following the motions of a juggler,

141
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,470
天文学家格雷格・劳克林可以直观的看出
astronomer Greg Laughlin can help visualize

142
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:24,340
为什么类似于涅墨西斯的恒星经过 
why cometary orbits are so vulnerable to the effects

143
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,220
会很容易影响彗星轨道
of a passing star like Nemesis.

144
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:28,100
嗨  格雷格
Hey, Greg.

145
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:32,430
这是乔希・霍顿  我们需要乔希的帮助
This is Josh Horton, and we've enlisted Josh to

146
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:35,860
以便于了解楚奥尔特云到底是怎么运作的
kind of help us understand how the Oort Cloud really works.

147
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,990
你一次能让多少球保持在空中
How many balls are you actually able to keep up in the air at one time?

148
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:39,670
七个
That was seven.

149
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:41,550
我也能玩八个或者九个  
I can do a little bit of eight and nine,

150
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,750
不过一般练习时我都用七个球
but seven is what I practice the most.

151
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:48,360
杂耍者向空中抛东西时的弧线
The arc of something that a juggler is tossing up is very

152
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,010
和彗星在它的偏心轨道上的轨迹非常相似
much like the arc that a comet makes on its eccentric orbit.

153
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,200
特别是因为球在接近最高点时减速
Especially because it's going slow near the top,

154
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,310
接近最低点的时候加速
and it's going very quickly near the bottom.

155
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,540
如果我们想要模仿整个的奥尔特云
If we want to simulate the whole Oort Cloud,

156
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,410
我们必须同时让多个球运动
then we've gotta keep a lot of balls in motion.

157
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,900
所以我在想你能不能教教我
So I'm wondering if you can maybe give me a quick--

158
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,920
好的  我可以试一下
Yeah. Yeah, I can try.

159
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,600
从两个开始好了
Well, let's start with two.

160
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,760
两个球
Two balls.

161
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:11,490
你需要做的是
What you're gonna do here

162
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:14,450
使两个球在空中交叉
is you're gonna cross both balls in the air.

163
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,470
开始扔吧  不对
So it's gonna be throw-- No.

164
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:18,820
两个球的轨迹要相同  和彗星轨道一样
The throws are exactly the same, just like the path of a comet.

165
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,100
看着  交叉  交叉
So...Cross, cross.

166
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:23,750
它们在空中划出了一个"X"
They're making an "X" In the air.

167
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,510
-它们要同时被扔出去吗  -不对
- Do they leave at the same time or-- - No,

168
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:28,260
先扔右  再左  接住  接住
It's right, left, catch, catch.

169
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,270
-右  左  -差不多是这样
- Right, left-- - No that was it.

170
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,630
再把你左手那个扔高点就好了
Just throw your left hand a little bit higher.

171
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,800
右  左  接  接
Right, left, catch, catch.

172
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,730
不错  你差不多是同时接住它们的
Good. You're kind of catching 'em at the same time.

173
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,130
右  左  接  接
Right, left, catch, catch.

174
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:36,960
好一点了
That was better.

175
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,140
我就像是一个太阳系
So I'm a little bit like a Solar System where there's some

176
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,480
有着严重的重力不稳定性
serious gravitational instability in the mix.

177
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:49,560
乔希同时保持七个球在空中
So Josh is keeping seven balls in the air at the same time,

178
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,510
这和太阳的工作有些相似  太阳是同时保持
and that's not unlike the Sun's job, which is to keep trillions

179
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:57,030
数万亿的彗星同时运行在奥尔特云的轨道上
of comets all orbiting in the Oort Cloud.

180
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,480
但是根据太阳伴星假说
But according to the Nemesis hypothesis,

181
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:08,080
每2600万年  太阳的这个微妙的"把戏"
the Sun's delicate juggling act is disrupted

182
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,940
就会被它的邪恶双子星干扰一次
by its evil stellar twin every 26 million years.

183
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:18,080
就像恐怖电影中的鬼怪  这个邪恶双子星
And like something out of a horror movie, this evil twin

184
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:21,100
是极难察觉到的
could be nearly invisible.

185
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,780
我们的太阳真的有一颗邪恶双子星吗
Does our Sun have an evil twin?

186
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,750
一颗名为涅墨西斯的恒星
A star named "Nemesis"

187
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,880
是否在远离我们太阳系的轨道上运行着
orbiting the distant reaches of our Solar System?

188
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:40,080
是否每2600万年  它会从奥尔特云向地球
And every 26 million years, does it fling comets

189
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,190
抛掷彗星吗
from the Oort Cloud toward Earth?

190
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,360
有时候它们会被抛出  有时它们也会
Sometimes they get tossed out, other times they orbit

191
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,980
无攻击性的运转直到它们消逝
harmlessly until they evaporate and go away.

192
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:52,810
如果有彗星群穿越太阳系
If you have comets rattling through the inner Solar System,

193
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,100
格雷格・劳克林
加利福尼亚大学圣塔克鲁兹分校

194
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:55,070
那么就可以说  一切预测都不准了
then, in a sense, all bets are off.

195
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:58,470
科学家理查德・穆勒不仅仅提出理论认为
Scientist Richard Muller not only theorizes

196
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:02,540
这种周期性混乱是受一颗太阳的致命伴星影响
that this periodic mayhem is caused by a deadly companion star to the Sun,

197
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:08,510
他还确切的了解它是什么恒星  红矮星
he believes he knows precisely what kind of star it is-- A red dwarf.

198
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:11,160
有一个恒星以2600万年为周期
That there is a star orbiting the Sun

199
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,190
围绕太阳运转  这是我的想法
in a 26-million-year period, that was my idea.

200
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:19,320
我们假设这颗恒星是红矮星
Let's assume the star is a red dwarf star.

201
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:20,560
理查德・穆勒
美国劳伦斯伯克利国家实验室

202
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,250
为什么是红矮星呢
Why a red dwarf?

203
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,690
因为这是银河系里最常见的恒星
Because that's the most populist star in the galaxy.

204
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,730
红矮星是一颗很小的恒星
A red dwarf is a tiny star

205
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:34,660
总重量还不及太阳的十分之一
that weighs in with a mass less than 1/10 of our Sun.

206
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,740
但是正如天文学家格雷格・劳克林所展示的
But as astronomer Greg Laughlin demonstrates,

207
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,900
它的影响就像是在杂耍者抛掷火焰时
it can have the effect of a 9-pod bowling ball

208
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,230
再接住一个八斤重的保龄球
tossed into the arms of a juggler playing with fire.

209
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,930
奥尔特云本身是个很无聊的地方  
All by itself, the Oort Cloud is a pretty boring place,

210
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:51,320
所以我们打算来点刺激的
and so we're gonna have to up the ante a little bit.

211
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:57,720
这些就代表奥尔特云里的彗星
These are gonna represent the comets in the Oort Cloud.

212
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,200
准备好了吗
Are you ready?

213
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,000
我最好要往后退一点
I think I'm gonna step back a little bit.

214
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:12,360
乔希让火炬顺利的运动
So Josh has got them all going nicely,

215
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,300
就像是彗星在奥尔特云里运转一样
just like the comets orbiting in the Oort Cloud.

216
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:19,470
我们来看看如果我把这个红矮星
So let's see what would happen if I took this red dwarf and

217
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,700
扔进太阳系时会发生什么
tossed it into the Solar System.

218
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,080
-乔希  你准备好接红矮星了吗  -好了
- Josh, are you ready for the red dwarf? - Yeah.

219
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:25,250
开始吧
Here we go.

220
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:33,300
你可以看见  红矮星闯进太阳系 
So as you can see, the red dwarf coming through the solar system

221
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:37,590
确实改变了彗星群的轨道
has really changed the orbits of the comets.

222
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:41,230
注意  事实上这两个彗星是落向地球了
Notice that two of these comets actually crashed onto the earth.

223
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:44,970
这和彗星撞击发生时情况类似  
That's not unlike what happens when a giant impact occurs,

224
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,440
大规模物种灭绝就会降临到我们头上
and we get one of these mass extinctions.

225
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,740
地球所经历的一系列冲击
For many people the idea that Earth has been

226
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,970
是由一颗环绕太阳的灾星引发的理论
the victim of a series of impacts caused by

227
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:01,300
对于大多数人来说都不太可信
an orbiting death star seems unlikely.

228
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:05,380
毕竟当我们望向天空时
After all, when we look at the sky,

229
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,530
我们只能看见一个太阳
we only see one sun.

230
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:12,570
但事实上  大部分恒星都是成对出现的
But in fact, the majority of stars come in pairs.

231
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:18,400
大概有60%或者70%的恒星实际上是
Probably something like 60%, 70% of stars may indeed be

232
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,380
二元的  或者星系中有两颗以上的恒星
binary, or have even higher numbers of stars in the system.

233
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,370
根据理查德・穆勒的太阳伴星假说
According to Richard Muller's Nemesis hypothesis,

234
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:34,080
我们的太阳是二元恒星系统的一部分
our Sun is part of such a binary star system.

235
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:37,130
一切都说得通
It all works.

236
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:41,190
你需要做的就是假设太阳和
All you have to do is hypothesize that the Sun,

237
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:44,620
银河系里其它三分之二的恒星一样 
like 2/3 of all the other stars in the galaxy,

238
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,910
有一个伴星
has a companion--

239
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:49,680
它2600万年的公转周期  然后就明白了
This one with a 26-million-year period-- And there you have it.

240
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:51,810
若真为此
But if so,

241
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:54,670
为什么我们在天上看不见太阳的双子星呢
why don't we see the Sun's twin in the sky?

242
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,140
穆勒说  原因很简单
According to Muller, the reason is simple.

243
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:02,060
涅墨西斯是一颗极其黯淡的红矮星
Nemesis is an extremely dim red dwarf.

244
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:05,200
当我第一次提出涅墨西斯这个理论时
When I first came up with the Nemesis theory, the issue was,

245
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,050
问题在于"等等  那为什么没人发现它呢"
"Well, wait a minute, how come nobody found it?"

246
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,970
答案很显然
And that was pretty obvious.

247
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,430
它肯定很难被观测到
It has to be hard to find.

248
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,910
据定义  红矮星基本不会发光
By definition, a red dwarf barely glows at all.

249
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,500
它可能是离我们的太阳最近的一颗恒星
It would be the closest star to our Sun,

250
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,050
可是我们居然不知道它的存在
and we wouldn't even know it.

251
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:25,410
为什么呢
Now, why is that?

252
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:28,780
我们发现临近恒星的方法无非是因为
The way we discover nearby stars is either because

253
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:32,930
它们很耀眼  可是红矮星一点也不明亮
they're very bright-- And the red dwarf star is not very bright--

254
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:35,380
或是因为太阳会经过它
Or because the Sun is moving past it.

255
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:37,530
这颗恒星和我们一起移动
This star is moving with us.

256
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:38,550
是的  它围绕我们运转
Yes, it's orbiting us,

257
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,840
但是运转的速度很慢--要2600万年
but that orbit is very slow-- 26-million years.

258
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,100
所以基本上是和地球同步
So it'd be moving with us.

259
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,550
它看上去就像固定在天空中一动不动
It would just be at a fixed position in the sky, and wouldn't move.

260
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,750
换句话说  当从地球上看过去时 
In other words, when viewed from Earth,

261
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:52,250
大部分附近的恒星都在时刻移动中
most nearby objects are shifting over time.

262
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:55,360
但是涅墨西斯却一直不动
But Nemesis is sitting still.

263
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,920
因此  寻找涅墨西斯逐渐成为热点
So as the search for Nemesis enters high gear,

264
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,680
关键问题在于  何处寻芳踪
one key question is where to look.

265
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:11,460
所幸科学家们了解双子星的运行方式  
Luckily, scientists understand how binary stars orbit each other,

266
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:16,020
这方法恰可用于寻找涅墨西斯
and they can apply this knowledge to the search for Nemesis.

267
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,310
如果太阳和涅墨西斯质量相当
If both the Sun and Nemesis were of equal mass,

268
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,060
那它们的绕转轨道必是一个巨大的正圆形
they would orbit each other in a vast but equal circle,

269
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:28,640
寻找涅墨西斯的难度便相对较小
and the search for Nemesis would be relatively easy.

270
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:33,720
但质量相当的双子星十分罕见
But binary stars are rarely equally sized.

271
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:38,910
仅有10% 或 20%的双子星
10% or 20% of binary stars have two components

272
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:41,310
两颗恒星大小完全相当
where the stars are really on an equal footing.

273
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,370
绝大多数情况下  其中的一个
And then there are also a large number of stars where one star

274
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:46,810
要比另一颗恒星质量更大
is considerably more massive than the other.

275
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,050
若双子星质量大小不等
When binary stars are of different sizes,

276
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:56,730
较小的一个  即涅墨西斯
the smaller star, in this case Nemesis,

277
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:00,760
多以椭圆形轨道围绕质量大的恒星
swings in a wide orbit around its larger companion,

278
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,520
也就是太阳
in this case the Sun,

279
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:05,400
太阳基本上看不出来是在运行
which barely seems to orbit at all.

280
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,520
那么  较小的为何在较远轨道上运行呢
Why does the smaller one move in a much wider circle?

281
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:14,420
这可以用"质心"的概念来解释
The answer has to do with a concept called the "Center of mass."

282
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:17,530
我们请一对体操运动员在平衡木上
A pair of gymnasts on a balance beam

283
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:20,440
为各位做直观的阐释
can help us visualize how it works.

284
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:26,080
一对双子星绕着它们的质心运行
Stars in a binary pair orbit around their common center of mass.

285
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:26,880
劳拉・丹利
格里菲斯天文台

286
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,350
如果二星质量相当  
If two stars are about the same mass,

287
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:32,090
它们将围绕中间不可见的点运行
they orbit around an invisible spot in the middle,

288
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,730
该点恰好位于二者正中  
right in between the two of them,

289
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:38,590
就像平衡木上的塔米和卡莉
just like Tami and Carly are balanced on this seesaw.

290
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:41,890
你们能保持平衡吗
Wow, you guys are balanced?

291
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,450
但与两位运动员不同
But unlike these gymnasts,

292
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:46,400
涅墨西斯和太阳质量不等
Nemesis and the Sun are not equal.

293
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:49,170
天文学家理查德・穆勒估算 
Astronomer Richard Muller estimates that

294
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:53,860
太阳的质量是其未知双子星的十倍
the Sun has ten times more mass than its undiscovered twin.

295
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:57,940
若双子星中的一颗质量大于其"兄弟"
And when one binary star is larger than its sibling,

296
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:03,000
二者的质心将移向较大的一颗
the center of mass between them shifts closer to the larger star.

297
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,260
现在塔米将为我们演示这一理论
So Tami's going to help illustrate that.

298
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,640
塔米  你大概有多重呢
Tami, how much do you weigh?

299
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,980
-大概59公斤  -哦  59公斤
- About 130.  - About 130?

300
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,780
在这头  我们放一块约16千克的重物
And we have weights at this end that are about 35 pounds.

301
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:17,850
这样  你比重物质量的四倍略微轻一点
So you're just a little bit less than four times that weight.

302
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:18,970
上来
So climb on up.

303
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:22,430
看看你站在哪  才能维持平衡木的平衡
Let's see where you have to be to balance the balance beam.

304
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:28,790
鉴于塔米大约是金属重物的四倍重
Since Tami weighs about four times as much as the metal weights,

305
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:34,270
她必须大幅度移向质心以保持平衡
she must move far closer to the center of mass to maintain balance.

306
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:38,900
如果塔米和重物代表双子星
If Tami and the weights represented binary stars,

307
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,900
较轻的重物将在较远的轨道上运行
the weights would orbit far out in the distance

308
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,780
而塔米则近于一动不动
while tami would barely move.

309
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:47,660
事实上  二者是相互围绕运行的
In fact, both would be orbiting each other.

310
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,800
人们常误以为较重的恒星多原地不动
It's kind of a misconception to think that the more massive

311
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:55,320
而较轻的都以它为中心绕转
star doesn't move, and the less massive star just goes around it.

312
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:00,090
事实上  它们仍是绕着共同的质心运行
In fact, they're still both orbiting the common center of mass.

313
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,140
较重的恒星  轨道半径较短
The more massive star moves less,

314
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:07,140
而较轻的恒星  轨道半径较长
and the less massive star moves more.

315
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,610
这一认识对于计算涅墨西斯
This insight is key to calculating where

316
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:18,930
与太阳的相对距离至关重要
Nemesis might lie in relation to the Sun.

317
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:23,000
我们知道  公转周期是两千六百万年
We know it's a 26-million-year period.

318
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,490
这提示我们它究竟有多远
That tells us how far out it is.

319
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:27,590
即其公转半径稍大于一光年
It has a radius of about a little over a light year.

320
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,940
至此我们知道了运行轨道半径
So we know the orbital size.

321
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,210
科学家现已粗略算得搜索范围
Now that scientists know roughly where to look,

322
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:40,840
寻找涅墨西斯已全面启动
the search for Nemesis is in full swing.

323
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:46,870
目前  这一研究指向一个令人震惊的理论
And so far, that search has led to an astounding new theory.

324
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:50,870
不光是太阳有个不为人知的"兄弟"
Not only might the Sun have an undiscovered twin,

325
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:57,380
太阳系里也许藏匿着一颗巨大的未知恒星
the solar system may be harboring a massive undiscovered planet.

326
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:06,700
太阳邪恶双子星扰动彗星群
In the hunt for an evil twin to our Sun that

327
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,950
将死亡之雨降于大地  我们努力寻其踪迹 
shakes comets loose and rains death across the earth,

328
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:14,490
万事俱备  只欠东风
all of the pieces are in place except one.

329
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:20,740
要使涅墨西斯理论成立
The Nemesis theory really needs the smoking gun of

330
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:23,470
克利福德・强森
南加利福尼亚大学

331
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:25,440
必须有确凿证据
actually finding direct evidence for the object itself

332
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,500
证明涅墨西斯确实存在
in order for the whole thing to hold together.

333
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:30,250
那么  为何我们现在还毫无所获
Now, why haven't we found it yet?

334
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:33,610
事实上  有不少天文学家对此漠不关心
Actually, there are quite a few astronomers who don't pay very

335
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:37,790
理查德・穆勒
美国劳伦斯伯克利国家实验室

336
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:36,070
他们简单的认为
much attention to this, and simply assume that

337
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:38,810
如果该星存在  那么应当早就被人们发现
if it existed, it would have been found by now.

338
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,940
我们坚信  在接下来的几年该星会被发现
We believe this thing can be found within the next few years.

339
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:46,330
我们要做的  是对暗星进行一次认真研究
What it takes is a survey of dim stars.

340
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,810
启用"智者"
Enter WISE,

341
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:56,350
即沿轨道运行的大范围红外研究探测器
the orbiting "Wide-field infrared survey explorer,"

342
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:01,630
可能成为揭开涅墨西斯之谜的强大新仪器
a powerful new tool that just might crack the Nemesis mystery.

343
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,550
"智者"之所以如此出色
The reason that WISE is gonna be so good

344
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:07,820
麦克・布朗
加利福尼亚理工学院

345
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,750
正是因为它采用红外技术
is because it operates in the infrared.

346
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,130
简单地说  它可以观察到热源
It sees heat, basically.

347
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:13,950
红外扫描仪通过测算热源  而非传统光源
By measuring heat instead of light, infrared scanners

348
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:17,820
可以轻易发现发热但不发光的物体
can make warm but dark objects easy to spot.

349
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:22,070
通过红外观察热源的优势在于
The nice thing about looking in the infrared at the heat of

350
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:25,820
恒星与太阳的距离对观测没有影响
it is you don't care how far away you are from the Sun.

351
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:29,630
我们以木星为例
Jupiter provides an example.

352
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,140
木星表面的温度
The temperature on the surface of Jupiter

353
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:36,470
约为摄氏零下145度
measures 230 degrees below zero fahrenheit.

354
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,190
但较之摄氏零下270度的宇宙空间温度 
But that's blazing hot when contrasted with

355
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:43,380
这又是如火般炙热的
the 450-degree-below-zero temperature of space.

356
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,010
所以  即便缺少太阳的照耀
So even in the absence of sunlight,

357
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,980
类似木星这样较远的恒星
a distant, Jupiter-like planet

358
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,870
也可能在红外扫描中  发出耀眼的光芒
would glow brightly in the infrared.

359
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:02,140
我们可以在赛车跑道上直观地了解
By visiting a motor speedway, we can see how the WISE

360
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:05,920
"智者"红外技术比对不同温度的物体
survey might help find Nemesis by exploiting the infrared

361
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,530
对寻找涅墨西斯究竟有何益处
contrast between objects of different temperatures.

362
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:17,070
在这  轰鸣的发动机只能展示过程的一半
Here, the roar of the engine only tells half the story.

363
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,740
今天  我们来到驾驶技术竞速学校
I came out here today to the drive tech racing school

364
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,980
亚历克・弗里喷库
加州大学伯克利分校

365
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:22,330
坐进一辆赛车
to be in a race car

366
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:24,910
在跑道上跑几圈
that would go zooming around this track a bunch of times.

367
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:29,140
我们要用红外相机拍摄赛车
An idea was to film the car with an infrared camera,

368
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,210
以显示出高热的物体
and show us things that are hot--

369
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:33,380
温度高于周围环境
hotter than the outside surroundings--

370
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:36,060
在红外光谱中发光的物体
and glowing at infrared wavelengths.

371
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,560
-泰德你好啊  -你好
- So, hey Ted! - How you doing?

372
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,560
幸会幸会
Good to meet you.

373
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,560
彼此彼此
Likewise.

374
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,560
今天是你来开车吗
Yeah. You're the driver?

375
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,560
是的先生
Yes, sir.

376
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,300
我们打算开多快呢
Now, how fast are we gonna be going?

377
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,070
大概每小时274公里吧
Approximately 170 miles an hour.

378
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:52,020
差不多就是普通高速路行驶速度的三倍
Now, that's about three times normal highway driving speed, so

379
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,280
看来等下真的会"热火朝天"
whoa, things are really gonna heat up.

380
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,280
是啊
Oh, yeah.

381
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,580
闲话少说  出发吧
All right, let's go, then.

382
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,580
工作人员布莱尔・迪普利帮我钻进这辆车
Blair Dupree of drive tech helped me get into the car.

383
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,710
带好护具  这个厚重的头盔
Good protection. This is a nice, thick helmet.

384
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:07,730
车门都没有  这可不太容易
And it's not so easy, because there's no doors, okay.

385
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,830
你得从窗户爬进去
You have to kind of climb in through a window.

386
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,810
把左脚抬起来放进去
Bring your left foot up in there. Okay.

387
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,180
再把右腿放进去
Bring your right foot on up.

388
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,900
我感觉自己像是"破车而入"
I feel like I'm breaking into a car.

389
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,950
然后再钻进去
And then kind of slither your way in.

390
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,020
在赛车里的感觉真棒
Being in that race car was really exciting.

391
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,000
当我们转弯时
When I was going around the turns,

392
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,340
我能感到强烈的离心力
I could really feel the g-forces.

393
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,820
泰德开得不错  是吧
Ted give you a good ride, did he?

394
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,420
幸亏是泰德开车
Yeah, well, I'm glad Ted was the driver.

395
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,840
我真的来不了这个  我去
I couldn't do this, you know?

396
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:39,490
我吓得腿都软了  而且我还是坐车的
I was scared out of my seat, and I wasn't even the driver, okay?

397
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:46,200
车辆预热完毕  热成像专家
With the car nicely warmed, a FLIR infrared camera,

398
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,590
罗斯・欧文斯利特架起一台红外摄像机
set up by thermal-imaging expert Ross Overstreet,

399
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:53,410
以全新的方式观察一切事物
sees everything, literally, in a new light.

400
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:54,580
你好  亚历克
Hello, Alex.

401
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,220
罗斯  还好吗
Hey, Ross, how you doing?

402
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,700
-很好  情况怎么样  -好  很好
- Doing good. How you doing? - Good, good.

403
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,260
让我们看看这些红外图像
Let's look at these infrared images.

404
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,220
我们正在拍摄车的尾部
Right now we're pointed at the back of the car.

405
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,570
这台仪器的好处是
The best way to think about it is

406
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:03,580
与其说是摄像机它更像是测量仪
it's more of a measurement device than a camera.

407
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:06,890
这张图上好像有无数温度计
It's like having a million different thermometers spread across the image.

408
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,640
每一个像素都能体现出测量温度
We're actually getting temperature measurements on each of those pixels.

409
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,810
温度高的地方
Things that are supposed to be hot

410
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:14,310
就呈现出红色  橘黄色和白色
look like they're glowing red and orange and white.

411
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:17,020
温度低的地方则是蓝色和黑色
Things that are cold are colored blue and black.

412
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:19,200
也就是我们熟知的冷色调
You know, colors you associate with cool objects.

413
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,640
-对  -你可以看到
- Right. - And you'll notice there's

414
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:23,350
这辆车上有几个不同的热区
several different hot areas of the vehicle.

415
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,070
我看到轮胎上的温度不太一样
Now, I see some variations across the tires.

416
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:26,920
你可以看到
Yeah, and you'll notice that

417
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,100
一个轮胎比另外一个轮胎稍许热些
the one tire is a little bit warmer than the other.

418
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,800
右胎温度果然高于左胎
The right-hand tire was indeed hotter than the left-hand tire

419
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,900
因为在转弯时右胎受压更大
because there was more pressure on it during the turns.

420
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,810
那么右胎能达到多少度呢
So how hot is that hotter tire there?

421
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:42,740
我们先前测量过  大概有摄氏89度
We made a measurement earlier of about 190 degrees fahrenheit.

422
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,290
这跟开水的温度差不多了
Almost the temperature of boiling water on the tires.

423
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,930
仅用肉眼  我们不可能区分出
When we just look by eye, we can't tell whether something is

424
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:49,050
哪里温度更高
hotter than something else.

425
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:51,350
但这样你就可以区分了  真不错
But here you can tell, and that's really cool.

426
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:53,230
是的  这台摄像机在漆黑的夜里
Right. And this camera would work just as well

427
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,990
和在大白天都能工作
if it was pitch black or in the middle of the day.

428
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:57,100
阳光对它没有影响
It doesn't care about solar light at all.

429
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,290
红外摄像机拍摄赛道的原理
The infrared camera sees the racetrack

430
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:04,790
和用"智者"探测
the way the WISE survey

431
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:08,360
黑暗而又遥远的太阳系领域的原理一样
scans the dark and far-away realms of our Solar System.

432
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:12,630
如果涅墨西斯真的存在
If Nemesis is out there,

433
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:14,740
那么红外线应该能探测到
infrared should reveal it.

434
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:19,070
赛车上的热点就像是那些远离太阳
The hot spots on the race car are sort of like warm,

435
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:24,050
在寒冷的太空中熠熠发光的温暖恒星
glowing objects out in the cold depths of space, far from the Sun.

436
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:28,580
这是一种探测遥远恒星的全新技术 
This is a whole new way of discovering objects--

437
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:32,920
这些恒星利用光学望远镜是捕捉不到的
Objects too faint to be seen through a normal optical telescope,

438
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,220
但红外线却能探测到
but bright enough to be detected in the infrared.

439
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:43,360
"智者"于2011年初完成了探测任务 
The WISE telescope completed its sky survey in early 2011,

440
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:48,730
但对涅墨西斯的探测还没定论
but in the search for Nemesis, the results are still inconclusive.

441
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:54,090
"智者"探测结果要花很长时间去分析
The WISE survey is going to take a long time to analyze,

442
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:56,800
因为它收集到了 
simply because there's a huge amount of data

443
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,170
海量的数据
that had been gathered by this craft.

444
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,380
我们仅研究了半数可能是涅墨西斯的天体
About half of the Nemesis candidates have not yet been studied.

445
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:07,690
我们预计  这个理论是对是错
But in the next few years, we expect the theory

446
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:09,500
将在接下来的几年里被证实
will be either proven right or wrong.

447
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:13,170
在那之前  有争议纯属正常
Until that time, it is and should be controversial.

448
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:21,230
为何距地球这么近的恒星如此难以发现
That something so relatively near to Earth can be so obscure

449
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,340
来自阿州莫比尔的弗兰克・切科夫斯基
is what Frank Jankowski of Mobile, Alabama,

450
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:27,200
想要询问宇宙
wants to ask The Universe.

451
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:33,040
为什么科学家们能观察到百万光年以外的天体

452
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:37,390
却不能找出在我们太阳系边上的天体

453
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,170
弗兰克  这是个有趣的问题
That's an interesting question, Frank.

454
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:42,350
百万光年以外的天体能被天文学家发现
The objects that are millions of light years away that

455
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:45,410
是因为它们能发出强光
astronomers can see are powerful and luminous.

456
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,350
它们能产生大量能量
They produce a lot of energy on their own,

457
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:49,070
就像是正在爆炸的恒星
like an exploding star.

458
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:53,140
但是在我们太阳系边上的天体可能很小
But an object near the edge of our Solar System might be small,

459
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:55,410
只反射微乎其微的太阳光
and it reflects only a little bit of sunlight,

460
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:57,970
所以我们在可见光的波段看不到它
so we can't see it at visible wavelengths.

461
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,340
询问宇宙

462
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,260
科学家在分析涅墨西斯的探测数据时
But scientist analyzed the data for signs of Nemesis,

463
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:09,070
他们有了一个令人不安的发现
they have made a disturbing discovery.

464
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:12,060
虽然计算表明
Although calculations indicate that

465
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,630
涅墨西斯要几百万年以后才会回来
Nemesis isn't due back for millions of years,

466
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:20,580
有颗恒星正在扰乱奥尔特云中的彗星
something appears to be shaking up the comets in the oort cloud right now.

467
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:27,170
难道涅墨西斯已经兵临城下了吗
Could Nemesis already be upon us?

468
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:37,820
自从涅墨西斯理论被提出
Since the birth of the Nemesis hypothesis,

469
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,620
天文学家们就密切注意着
astronomers have been on the lookout

470
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:43,890
会周期性扰乱奥尔特云中彗星引力的
for a faint red star that periodically disturbs the gravitation

471
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:45,940
黯淡的红矮星
of the Oort Cloud comets.

472
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:49,850
每隔2600万年  这会使得它们
This sends them on a catastrophic rendezvous

473
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:51,620
穿越包括地球的内太阳系
with the inner Solar System,

474
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:55,800
发生灾难性的碰撞
including Earth, every 26 million years.

475
00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:00,080
但当科学家们研究奥尔特云时
But as scientists study the Oort Cloud,

476
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,200
他们发现了令人不安的迹象
they have uncovered unsettling evidence

477
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:06,340
有东西正在干扰彗星的运行轨道
that something is disturbing comet orbits right now.

478
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:12,280
涅墨西斯已经回来了吗
Has Nemesis already returned?

479
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:17,370
如果太阳独立存在  没有涅墨西斯
If the Sun was all by itself, and there was no Nemesis,

480
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:18,980
那么奥尔特云中的彗星
then the comets in the Oort Cloud

481
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:24,100
它们的运行轨道将是可预测和规律的
would all have very predictable and regular orbits.

482
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:22,550
格雷格・洛格林  
加利福尼亚大学圣塔克鲁兹分校

483
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:28,320
它们到达和出发的时间应该很有规律
They'd be very regular in their arrival times and departure times.

484
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:36,380
如果只有太阳的引力干扰 
Without gravitational interference from anything other than the Sun,

485
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:39,760
奥尔特云中的彗星就如杂耍物体
Oort Cloud comets, like juggled objects,

486
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:43,040
在宇宙中有规律得运动
could spread out evenly across the sky.

487
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:48,670
但这并不是一些科学家们得出的结论
However, that's not what some scientists report.

488
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:54,680
我们仰望星空  观察这些彗星从何而来
When we look out into the sky, and look at where the comets are coming from,

489
00:27:54,680 --> 00:28:00,150
它们的方向往往集中在天空的某个固定区域
their directions tend to concentrate in a certain region of the sky.

490
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:03,800
有一个可能的解释是  
And one possible explanation for that is that

491
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:08,050
这种偏移是一个我们看不见的天体
that skew is being directed by the gravitational perturbations

492
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:12,320
发出的引力干扰所导致的
from an unseen object that is out there.

493
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:17,400
基于这些研究  科学家们推测
Based on these observations, scientists infer

494
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:21,060
有一个巨大的天体正在干扰奥尔特云
that a huge object is disturbing the Oort Cloud.

495
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:26,170
这个道理和加利福尼亚运输官员
They do this the same way that California transit officials

496
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:30,440
推测扰乱洛城交通秩序的事故如出一辙
infer that an accident is disturbing traffic patterns in Los Angeles.

497
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:35,990
马克  我们在哪
So, Marco, where are we?

498
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:37,190
这房间是做什么的
What is this room?

499
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:39,120
墙上的图
Well, the map we have here on the wall,

500
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,970
是高速公路系统图
that's our freeway system map.

501
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:42,040
如你所见
And as you can see,

502
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,430
它显示了洛杉矶主要的高速路线
it shows the major freeway routes in Los Angeles.

503
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:49,900
绿点表示正常的交通车流
The green dots represent normal traffic flow,

504
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,730
红点表示
while the red dots indicate

505
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,540
某些原因引起了交通阻塞
that something is causing traffic to back up.

506
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:03,150
速度只是发生事故的一个迹象
So the speed here's just one indicator that something's going on,

507
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,680
但想知道到底发生了什么
but to really know what's going on,

508
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,200
你必须得有一个摄像头
you either have to have a camera

509
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,970
或是在现场的人告诉你到底发生了什么  
or a report from somebody who's actually there and able to tell you what it is.

510
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:10,860
非常正确
That's correct.

511
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,550
天文学家总是遇到这样的问题
Astronomers have this problem all the time,

512
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:17,650
他们试图研究他们并不能真正看到的东西
they're trying to understand what they can't actually see.

513
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:23,550
劳拉・丹利
格里菲斯天文台

514
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,810
天文学中  我们经常指出
In astronomy, we frequently infer

515
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:24,420
某物体的存在  并非因为我们亲眼所见
the existence of something, not because we can actually see it,

516
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,140
而是因为我们能够看到
but because we can see the influence

517
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,710
它对周围事物的影响
it has on the objects around it.

518
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:40,390
无论是车流太多还是高峰时段的车道太少
Whether too many cars or crowding too few lanes during rush hour,

519
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:43,340
或者是事故阻碍了交通
or an accident is slowing traffic flow,

520
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:45,830
一定有什么造成了拥堵
something causes congestion.

521
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:50,650
既然科学家们在奥尔特云中观测到类似现象
Since scientists see similar congestion in the Oort Cloud,

522
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:53,130
涅墨西斯有可能是罪魁祸首吗
could Nemesis be the perpetrator?

523
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:55,200
这地方真棒
This place is very impressive.

524
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:58,130
能得到所有监控录像和探测数据
It's got all the cameras, all the sensor data,

525
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:01,780
还有所有加州高速路巡逻事件的报告
all the California highway patrol incident reports.

526
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:05,710
这比天文学家研究的数据多得多
This is far more data than astronomers have to work with.

527
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:10,550
如果我们在太阳系周边布有无数摄像机
If we only had remote cameras all throughout the outskirts of the Solar System,

528
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:12,080
我们会更好的了解它
we might know a lot more about it.

529
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,020
尽管没有远程相机
Even without remote cameras,

530
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,850
科学家们提出了一个非凡的理论
scientists have proposed a remarkable theory

531
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:24,810
以解释奥尔特云中的堵塞
to explain the congestion in the Oort Cloud.

532
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,570
根据该理论
According to this theory,

533
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:31,900
干扰奥尔特云的原因不是涅墨西斯
the culprit disturbing the Oort Cloud isn't Nemesis.

534
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:34,560
而是同样让人惊讶的
Instead, it's something equally

535
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:38,570
一颗巨大且未知的恒星  
astounding-- A giant, undiscovered planet,

536
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:41,300
质量是木星的四倍
four times the mass of Jupiter.

537
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:45,730
简言之  它是太阳系最大的恒星
In short, the largest planet in the Solar System.

538
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:49,470
科学家称它为堤喀[命运女神]
Scientists have proposed naming it Tyche.

539
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:54,400
简单的说  堤喀是"小版的涅墨西斯"
In a nutshell, Tyche is "Nemesis light."

540
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:57,070
涅墨西斯  在最初的假设中
Nemesis, in the original hypothesis,

541
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,740
是一颗红矮星
was literally a red dwarf star.

542
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:02,610
质量是木星的100倍
Something that was 100 times more massive than Jupiter.

543
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:07,870
不像涅墨西斯  堤喀不会像星星一样发光
Unlike Nemesis, Tyche would not glow like a star.

544
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:13,380
它更像是变形版的木星
Instead, it would look like a strange version of Jupiter.

545
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,160
如果你戴上夜视镜     
If you put on night-vision goggles,

546
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:20,400
会看到很不一般的景象
then it would be quite a bit more impressive sight.

547
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:24,640
你能看到云中的裂缝和闪电
You would see breaks in the clouds, and there would be lightning.

548
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,070
你会看见云层被它底下的闪电 
You would see the clouds light up from the lightning down

549
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:29,700
照亮
beneath the cloud tops.

550
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:38,120
堤喀可能会影响奥尔特云中彗星的轨道
Tyche might disturb the orbit of comets in the Oort Cloud,

551
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:42,080
但它绝不是地球周期性物种灭绝的原因
but it can't be the source of Earth's periodic extinctions.

552
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:44,100
首先  它的假定位置
First, its proposed position

553
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,580
决定了其100万年的公转周期
puts it on a 1-million-year orbit,

554
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:50,030
而非像涅墨西斯一样的2600万年
not 26 million, like Nemesis.

555
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,640
其次  它太小了
Second, it's too small.

556
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:59,900
堤喀没有引力来移动彗星群
Tyche doesn't really have the gravitational mojo to dislodge comets,

557
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:04,190
造成这些周期性的毁灭
send them crashing in these periodic extinctions--

558
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:06,430
真的重组奥尔特云
really rearrange the Oort Cloud.

559
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:12,770
所以它的影响仅仅是一些小的偏移 
And so it's effects would be visible only in these small skews,

560
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:17,890
而不会引发大量彗星突然来袭
and not in the form of huge pulses of comets coming out of seemingly nowhere.

561
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:25,070
如同涅墨西斯一样  NASA的"智者"探测
Just as with Nemesis, NASA's WISE survey

562
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:28,580
应该能探测到堤喀  只要它存在
should be able to detect Tyche, if it exists.

563
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:33,080
当我们惊讶于太阳系可能藏有一颗
While it's surprising that our Solar System might harbor a

564
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:36,540
巨大且未知的恒星  该理论既没有支持
giant, undiscovered planet, it doesn't support or refute the

565
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:41,020
也没有驳斥未知的涅墨西斯的存在
idea that it also harbors the undiscovered star Nemesis.

566
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:43,500
但近期一个对外太阳系的发现 
But a recent finding in the outer Solar System

567
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:46,950
可能有助于探索涅墨西斯是否存在 
may shed more light on whether Nemesis really exists,

568
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:50,960
和了解它对地球生命的威胁
and the kind of threat it may pose to life on Earth.

569
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,180
2003年  天文学家麦克・布朗
In 2003, astronomer Mike Brown

570
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,250
有了一个历史性的重大发现
made a historic discovery

571
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:01,930
他在夜空中发现了一颗令人无法解释的恒星
when he found something floating around the night sky he couldn't explain.

572
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,680
我记得我发现塞得娜的那天
I remember the day that I discovered Sedna.

573
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,680
看着我电脑的屏幕和那些图片
Looking at it on my computer screen, looking at these pictures,

574
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:10,530
麦克・布朗
加利福尼亚理工学院

575
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,480
我的第一反应是"这不是真的"
my first reaction was "That can't be real."

576
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,440
那太遥远了
It's too far away.

577
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,150
不会有这样的东西存在于太阳系中
Nothing like that exists in the Solar System.

578
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,570
他无意中发现的
What he stumbled upon

579
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:21,930
恰好是一颗比月球要小的小恒星
turned out to be a planetoid just smaller than our moon,

580
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:24,610
现在被命名为塞得娜
now named Sedna.

581
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:28,870
然而塞得娜引出了一个科学难题
But Sedna presents a scientific quandary.

582
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:33,870
塞得娜离太阳最近距离
At its nearest point, Sedna lies about three times farther away

583
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:38,450
是木星和太阳距离的三倍  在此区域中
from the Sun than Pluto, in a region where astronomers never

584
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:41,420
天文学家从没想过会发现恒星
expected to find planetary bodies.

585
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:44,510
这是我们知道的
It's the coldest, most distant place

586
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:46,620
整个太阳系中最寒冷和遥远的地方
that we know in the whole Solar System.

587
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:48,230
如果你坐在塞得娜的表面  
If you were sitting on the surface of Sedna,

588
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:51,870
你可以拿一根大头针  然后伸直手臂
you could take a straight pin and hold it out at arm's length,

589
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,670
仅用大头针的顶端  你就能覆盖住太阳
and with the head of that pin, you could cover up the Sun.

590
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:00,360
除了处在出人意料的边远区域
In addition to being in an unexpectedly distant region,

591
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:05,700
塞得娜还在太阳系中有着广阔的椭圆形轨道
Sedna also takes a wildly elliptical orbit through the Solar System.

592
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:10,180
奥秘就在于塞得娜附近没有任何事物
The mystery is there's nothing anywhere near Sedna that could

593
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:14,090
可以产生如此遥远和极端的轨道
account for an orbit that distant and that extreme.

594
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:19,100
它现在所处的位置  不受任何物体影响
The place where it is now, nothing ever affects it.

595
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,900
它周围没有任何星球
It doesn't come close to any planets,

596
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:22,910
没有恒星接近过它
there are no stars that ever come close to it.

597
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:27,940
那是什么迫使塞得娜形成如此独特的轨道
So what forced Sedna into its unique orbit?

598
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,590
理论上  死星涅墨西斯是否对其有影响呢
And in theory, could the death star Nemesis have played a role?

599
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:39,080
对于布朗来说  蹦床帮助解释了
For Brown, the bounce of a trampoline offers a way to

600
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:42,380
塞得娜是如何形成让科学家 
understand how Sedna ended up in an orbit

601
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,570
匪夷所思的独特轨道
that remains a head-scratcher for astronomers.

602
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:49,380
以60里面为单位  我身后的测量杆
I have behind me a measuring stick that gives how high I'm

603
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,590
能测出我将要跳多高
gonna bounce in 2-foot intervals you see here.

604
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:56,700
弹跳高度代表  在我的运行轨道上
And what that bounce is supposed to represent is how far away

605
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:59,140
我离太阳有多远
from the Sun I am in my orbit.

606
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:02,490
在普通的恒星轨道上  圆形的恒星轨道
In a normal planetary orbit, in a circular planetary orbit, the

607
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,580
恒星围绕着太阳运动
planet circles around the Sun,

608
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:07,430
和太阳总是保持不变的距离
always staying the same distance from the Sun.

609
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:09,660
就有点像我站在蹦床上
And that's sort of like me staying on a trampoline, always

610
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:11,940
和地面总是保持着相等距离
the same distance from the floor.

611
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:12,930
除了沿着圆形轨道运动  
Other sorts of orbits can be,

612
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:14,400
其它的公转轨道
instead of going in a circular orbit,

613
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:17,330
可以环绕着太阳  沿着椭圆轨道运动
you can go in an elliptical orbit around the Sun.

614
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:20,210
你远离太阳  又朝着太阳转回来
You move away from the Sun, you come back towards the Sun.

615
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:22,310
所以你会越来越远然后越来越近
And so you'll be moving further away and getting closer.

616
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:27,020
就和你在蹦床上开始上下跳动一样
And that would be starting to jump up and down on the trampoline.

617
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,870
如同地心引力维持公转  
Like gravity keeping us in orbit,

618
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,380
当我们到达弹跳顶点  
when we reach the apex on the trampoline,

619
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,530
重力会把我们拉下来
gravity will pull us back down.

620
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:39,150
所以只要没有什么干扰我  我就会一直
So as long as nothing happens to me, I stay in this orbit

621
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,640
在这条轨道上  上下跳动
forever, jumping up and down,

622
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,200
总是达到同一高度
always to the same height.

623
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,370
但一些不平常的因素影响着塞得娜
But something unusual afflicted Sedna.

624
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:52,640
它碰到了一种神秘力量
It brushed up against a mysterious force

625
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:57,520
将它推入了一个没有恒星存在的区域
that shoved it into a region where no planetary body should exist.

626
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,190
有人怀疑这种力量就是涅墨西斯
Some suspect that force was Nemesis.

627
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:05,250
假如太阳的邪恶双子星存在  
And if the Sun's evil twin is out there,

628
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:08,420
科学家们便可以预测
scientists can tell exactly

629
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:11,870
我们何时看到其回归的可怕迹象
when we'll see the terrifying signs of its return.

630
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:22,190
就在天文学家寻找一颗名为涅墨西斯时
As astronomers search for a death star named Nemesis

631
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,990
它可能会周期性对地球造成大量物种灭绝
that might periodically cause mass extinctions on Earth,

632
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,630
近期对于小世界塞得娜的发现
the recent discovery of a tiny world named Sedna

633
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,970
也许提供了线索
could prove key.

634
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:37,330
亿万年前  塞得娜围绕着太阳公转 
Billions of years ago, Sedna revolved around our Sun,

635
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:40,950
就像其他星球一样  其轨道近乎圆形
like other planets, in a nearly circular orbit.

636
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,760
然而有两件不同寻常的事情发生了
But then two strange things happened.

637
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:49,480
首先  塞得娜被某物推入一个椭圆轨道
First, something forced Sedna into an extremely elliptical orbit.

638
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:54,540
然后另有其物把轨道推到如此远的地方
And then something else pushed that orbit out so far that it

639
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:57,890
以至科学家们无法给出合理的解释
seems to defy any visible explanation.

640
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:02,550
首先  它的椭圆形轨道是如何形成的
The first question-- What caused it's elliptical orbit--

641
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:04,990
已被轻易阐解
is fairly easily explained.

642
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:08,800
它可能仅是由于来自外部的巨型气体恒星
It could simply have been gravitational tugs from the

643
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,110
木星和土星所产生的引力牵引
outer gas giants Jupiter and Saturn.

644
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:15,780
我们可以用蹦床来说明
A trampoline can help illustrate.

645
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,480
为了真正了解太阳系内恒星轨道的运行方式
To really understand how orbits in the Solar System work

646
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,300
以及我们找到的这些极椭圆的轨道
and we get these very elliptical orbits,

647
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,890
我们要尽量在蹦床上跳高点
we need to get more height on the trampoline.

648
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:28,140
麦克・布朗
加利福尼亚理工学院

649
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:28,050
我可做不到  所以  肯  你来帮我跳
And I can't do it, so, Ken, I'm gonna need your help.

650
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:30,730
-好极了  我准备好了  -我先站开点
- Well, awesome, I' ready to help. - Let me get out of your way.

651
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:37,850
正如蹦床上多一个人的帮助就会使弹跳更高
Just as extra people on a trampoline create extra bounce,

652
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,510
太阳系中巨型气态恒星间产生的重力弹力
the large gas giants in the Solar System can create enough

653
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:48,600
足以使小恒星的轨道伸展成宽阔的椭圆型
gravitational bounce to stretch a smaller body's orbit into a wide ellipse.

654
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,890
这代表塞得娜在椭圆轨道上运行
So here's Sedna on a nice elliptical orbit.

655
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:56,300
紧接着塞得娜向其中一颗恒星靠近了一点
But then Sedna got a little bit close to one of the planets.

656
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:59,710
与此同时  这颗恒星所提供的额外引力
As soon as it does that, the extra gravity of the planet

657
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:03,430
促使了椭圆轨道的一点点变大
gives it a little boost into an even more elliptical orbit.

658
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:06,640
之后它靠近另外一颗恒星  也就是木星
But then it gets close to another planet-- Let's say Jupiter.

659
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,770
这是木星
Here comes Jupiter.

660
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:09,520
它弹跳得更高了
It bounces even higher.

661
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:11,030
借助木星足够强的弹力  
With enough bouncing from Jupiter,

662
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:14,190
我们可以使塞得娜弹出太阳系
we could bounce Sedna all of the way out of the Solar System.

663
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:22,730
由木星和土星证明了的轨道弹力
The orbital bounce provided by Jupiter and Saturn

664
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:26,690
能帮助解释塞得娜的轨道为何呈椭圆状
can explain how Sedna's orbit got its elliptical shape,

665
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:31,460
但其不能解释它为何最终被推入太阳系的边缘
but not how it ended up being forced into a distant region of the solar System,

666
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:36,570
在那里  科学家们认为不会恒星存在
where scientists never expected to find a planetary body.

667
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,170
塞得娜原本是在一个椭圆轨道上
Sedna was on an elliptical orbit,

668
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:42,580
现在它运行得逐渐越来越远
getting further and further and further.

669
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:46,300
它在远端轨道的时候  发生了什么
And then something happened to it when it was out here.

670
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:51,100
另一种引力将其强行推入另一个轨道  
Some other gravitational force pushed it off into a different orbit,

671
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:54,460
导致它不会回到它之前的公转轨道
and so it didn't come back to the same place it was before.

672
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:02,390
就好像有某种擦身而过的次要引力场 
It's as if some second gravitational force was passing by

673
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:05,450
把塞得娜强行推进一个不同的蹦床上 
and shoved Sedna onto a different trampoline,

674
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:08,680
因此它被弹入了一个意想不到的地方
so that it bounces in an unexpected region.

675
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:15,990
最有可能的情况是太阳附近有另一颗恒星
The most likely answer is that there was another star very close to the Sun

676
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:19,100
这段时间塞得娜正在经历这个过程
at the time when Sedna was going through this process.

677
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:23,060
太阳系可能是从一丛恒星群中诞生而成的
The Solar System probably formed in a cluster of stars,

678
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:30,150
格雷格・洛格林
加州大学圣塔克鲁兹分校

679
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:26,930
所以它与邻近的恒星甚至是流浪恒星的交汇
and so close encounters with nearby stars, nearby rogue planets even,

680
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,030
这样的事情
were much more common

681
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:32,490
在太阳系形成的最初期是很寻常的事情
during the very earliest days of the Solar System's formation.

682
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:40,140
太阳的这些兄弟姐妹们大多早已无影无踪
Most of these solar brothers and sisters have long since dispersed.

683
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:42,410
但根据涅墨西斯假说  
But according to the Nemesis hypothesis,

684
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:46,450
有一颗仍逗留于此  它仍然环绕着太阳  
one of them is still out there, still circling the Sun,

685
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:50,330
仍旧周期性的引发彗星冲撞
still causing periodic chaos amongst the comets,

686
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:55,310
仍然在等待再次将灭顶之灾降于地球
and still waiting to rain death on the Earth once more.

687
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,740
如果假设成立  
If that is correct,

688
00:39:57,030 --> 00:40:00,170
我们的后代在涅墨西斯归来之时
future generations will be faced with a monumental threat

689
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,820
将面临一场生死浩劫
when Nemesis returns.

690
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:05,160
时间约为一千万年
In 10 million years.

691
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,680
月亮  火星这些行星
The Moon, Mars, the planets would basically

692
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:13,190
它们在以后还是会保持原状
be unaltered from their current condition.

693
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,740
在地球上  城市可能不复存在了  
On Earth, cities might not be there,

694
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,420
但是对于陆地来说
but the continents would still be

695
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,620
极有可能与它们现在所处的位置不差分毫
almost in exactly the same places that they are now.

696
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,130
但是  根据涅墨西斯假说
But according to the Nemesis hypothesis,

697
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:32,400
距太阳一光之遥  一场巨变正在进行中
a major change is underway one light year from the Sun.

698
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,910
一颗暗红的恒星已经进入了奥尔特云
A dark-reddish star has entered the Oort Cloud.

699
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,640
涅墨西斯归来了
Nemesis has returned.

700
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:44,910
如果人类仍在地球上生存  
If humans still exist on Earth,

701
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:49,130
他们即将面临一个缓缓酝酿的宇宙威胁
they'll face a slow-building but imminent cosmic threat.

702
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:58,560
亚历克・弗里喷库
加州大学伯克利分校

703
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:56,500
奥尔特云团可能有十亿余颗彗星
The Oort Cloud contains perhaps 10 trillion comets, maybe even more.

704
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:58,240
但是  它相当庞大
But remember, it's really big.

705
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,350
所以若你置身奥尔特云团之中
So if you were in the Oort Cloud,

706
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:03,610
它不会让你时刻都被彗星撞击
it's not like you would be pelted by comets all the time.

707
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:06,080
它们之间的间距一般都很大
The spaces between them would pretty big.

708
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,680
就像这颗杂耍人手中的保龄球
Like a bowling ball in a juggler's hands,

709
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,220
涅墨西斯只会让少数彗星轨道混乱
Nemesis simply shuffles some comets out of its way.

710
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:24,560
理查德・穆勒
美国劳伦斯伯克力国家实验室

711
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:22,580
奥尔特云团的中间有一块空旷的地方
The Oort Cloud has an empty region in the middle.

712
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:25,130
它是被木星和太阳清理干净的
It's been cleaned out by Jupiter and by the Sun.

713
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:26,690
我们就生活在这里
We live in that region.

714
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:30,350
但随着涅墨西斯的靠近
But as Nemesis approaches,

715
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:34,050
太阳系的内部就成了一个射击场
the inner Solar System becomes a shooting gallery.

716
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:37,420
因此有可能会出现数量比平时稍多的彗星
And so there would start to be a few more comets than usual,

717
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:40,160
然后突然  满眼望去  尽皆彗星
and then, suddenly, there are just comets, comets coming all the time.

718
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,960
数量最多的时  每年将有一千至一万颗彗星
And at the peak, there might be 1,000 to 10,000 comets per year in the sky.

719
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:55,320
分析显示
According to the projections

720
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:58,640
地球会成为会成万箭彗星的靶心 
Earth would be in the crosshairs of this comet storm

721
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:01,080
长达一百万年之久
for a million years.

722
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:03,530
在这一百万年中  
Over a period of a million years,

723
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:08,240
可能有约十亿颗彗星造访
there would be visits by about a billion comets.

724
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,530
事实上  你可以算一算
Actually, you do the calculation,

725
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,080
总归有一颗会撞上地球  或者两颗
it turns out one of them will hit the Earth. One or two.

726
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:18,430
很难准确预言
It'd be difficult to predict exactly

727
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:20,200
它究竟会在何时发生
when the impact would happen,

728
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,750
不过可能会有这么个阶段
but there would be this phase--

729
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:25,400
是一段危险的时间 
This sort of danger zone in which the chances

730
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,760
在此期间  彗星撞击地球的几率 
for a catastrophic impact with something of a comet's size

731
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:31,870
要比现在高很多
would be much, much higher than they are now.

732
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:41,050
这次冲撞会再次引发地球物种覆灭吗
Will the impact spark another catastrophic extinction on Earth?

733
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:42,370
有可能
Perhaps.

734
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:44,990
除非人类坐以待毙
But only if we let it happen.

735
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:51,940
我喜欢开玩笑说涅墨西斯这次失算了
I like to joke that Nemesis planned this one poorly.

736
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:54,620
我们处于上次大灭绝与下次之间
In between the last extinction and the next one,

737
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:59,060
高智能的生物有大把的时间集中精力
there's plenty of time for intelligent life to get its act together

738
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:01,910
确保涅墨西斯再次归来时 
to make sure that next time Nemesis comes back

739
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:04,070
虽天空彗星满布
and the sky is filled with comets,

740
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,340
却都不会撞击地球
to make sure that none of them hit us.

741
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,500
覆灭之路是无法避免的吗
Is this future inevitable?

742
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:12,900
除非科学家们找到涅墨西斯
Until scientists either discover Nemesis

743
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:14,870
或完全否认其存在
or definitively rule it out,

744
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,570
没人能够确定
no one can know for sure.

745
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:22,200
要知道这不仅仅只是一次抽象的假设
It's important to realize this is not just an abstract discussion.

746
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:25,110
克利福德・强森
南加利福尼亚大学

747
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:27,600
这些物体撞击地球无疑是小几率事件
Clearly, these objects colliding with Earth happen very rarely.

748
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,340
但换个角度来说  当它们真的撞上来了
But on the other hand, when they do collide,

749
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,400
它们带来的冲击是巨大的
they're extremely cataclysmic.

750
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,300
所以我们能做的
So what we need to be able to do

751
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:37,600
是要更进一步的了解太阳系  
is get better understanding of our Solar System,

752
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:39,260
并密切留意我们的天空
and keep an eye on the sky,

753
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:41,860
因为它可能会是决定我们生死的关键
because it maybe crucial for our survival.

754
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:47,280
如果未来有一天  真的彗星漫天
If the future sky one day does fill with comets,

755
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:50,910
人类也许会找到一条自救之路
perhaps humanity will have found a way to save itself

756
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:53,270
而非最终成为太阳邪恶双子星的又一牺牲品
rather than end up one more victim of the Sun's evil twin.
