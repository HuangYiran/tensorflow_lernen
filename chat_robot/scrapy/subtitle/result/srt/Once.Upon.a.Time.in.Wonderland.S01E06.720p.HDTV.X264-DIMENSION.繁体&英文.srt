1
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,600
沒人相信愛麗絲
No one believed Alice

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,820
所說的仙境冒險
when she spoke of her adventures in wonderland

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,080
她是如何愛上精靈塞勒斯
Of how she fell in love with a Genie named Cyrus

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,020
紅心王后又是如何拆散他們的 
And how the Red Queen tore them apart.

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:12,850
不
No!

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,690
她被關進一家精神病院
She was locked away in an asylum.

7
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,770
愛麗絲  她需要幫助
Alice. She needs help.

8
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:20,080
所以紅桃杰克和我帶她回了仙境
So the Knave of Hearts and I brought her back to Wonderland

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,590
尋找她的真愛
to search for her true love.

10
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:23,200
他在這里  我能感覺到
He's here. I can feel it.

11
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,240
有人想阻止她
There are those who will try to stop her.

12
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,390
讓那個女孩許下三個愿
What we want can't be accomplished

13
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,280
我們的目的才能達成
until the girl's made all her wishes.

14
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,300
但是愛麗絲的偉大冒險
But alice's greatest adventure

15
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,620
剛剛開始
has just begun.

16
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,830
《仙境奇緣》前情提要
Previously in Wonderland...

17
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,330
父親  是我
Father, it's me!

18
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:40,050
你絕對不會相信我去了哪里
You're never going to believe where I've been!

19
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:40,870
愛麗絲
Alice.

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,270
你把魔塵給我弄來
You get me the dust,

21
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:44,890
我就幫你找你的精靈
and I'll help you find your Genie.

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,650
因為今天我們就將逃離此地
Today's the day we get out of here.

23
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,430
現在我想出去走走
I'd like to take a trip now.

24
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,860
-去哪  -你知道去哪
- Where to? - You know where.

25
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,360
我想去貝特萊姆皇家醫院
I'm looking for Bethlem Royal Hospital.

26
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:35,790
離這里遠嗎
Is it near?

27
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:38,570
這是...
What is...

28
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,020
你是...
Who are...

29
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,560
貝特萊姆  精神病院
Bethlem. The asylum.

30
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,490
在哪里
Where is it?

31
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,160
往東走
East of here,

32
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,370
過了威斯敏斯特大橋就是
Just past Westminster Bridge.

33
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:53,750
看吧
See?

34
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,920
這不是很容易嘛
That wasn't so difficult, was it?

35
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,420
不得不夸您一句
And I must compliment you.

36
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,300
這套西裝真不錯
That is a very nice suit.

37
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:13,460
貝特萊姆精神病院

38
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,790
鴉片酊

39
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:27,880
你好
Hello?

40
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,470
請問有什么事嗎
Can I help you?

41
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:31,900
但愿如此
I certainly hope so.

42
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,800
我是謝菲爾德醫生
My name is Dr. Sheffield.

43
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,960
我剛剛來到倫敦
I've just arrived in London

44
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,630
想向您請教一下
and I was hoping to pick your brain

45
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,630
之前一個病人的問題
about a former patient?

46
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,270
沒問題  我一向樂于為同行幫忙
Yes, of course. Always happy to help a colleague.

47
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,630
進來吧  請坐
Come in. Have a seat

48
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,180
我這里有點亂請別介意
You'll have to excuse the mess

49
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:47,870
沒想到會有客人來
I wasn't expecting anyone.

50
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,490
沒關系
That's quite all right.

51
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,790
我想這里的訪客應該不多
I imagine you don't get many visitors here.

52
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,650
大多數人對精神病院都有抵觸
Most people tend to avoid asylums.

53
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,370
他們擔心會受到這里...
They worry there might be something...

54
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,080
負面情緒的影響
contagious in the air.

55
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,390
請問您要詢問哪位病人呢
So, uh, which patient were you after?

56
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,050
金發  藍眼
Blonde hair, blue eyes.

57
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,230
你一定記得她
I'm sure you remember her.

58
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,640
名字叫愛麗絲
Name of Alice.

59
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,600
我貌似不記得
I don't recall

60
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,070
哪個病人叫愛麗絲
any Alice, I'm afraid.

61
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,730
我們這里病人太多了
We have so many patients.

62
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:25,980
你一定記得
Well, of course you do.

63
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,900
能有幾個病人會跟
But how many of them escape

64
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,850
一只會說話的兔子結伴逃跑呢
in the company of a talking rabbit?

65
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,760
我不知道你在說什么
I have no idea what you mean.

66
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,600
真的嗎  就算是親眼看到也不相信嗎
Really? Even after you saw it with your own two eyes?

67
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:40,920
會說話的兔子
A talking rabbit?

68
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,790
太離譜了
That's madness.

69
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:47,150
有時候最離譜的故事
Sometimes the maddest stories...

70
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,150
才是最可信的
are the truest ones.

71
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,730
快拿走
Put it away.

72
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,200
求你了
Please.

73
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,860
我一直在努力忘掉那件事
I've tried so hard to forget.

74
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:06,970
好吧
Yes, well...

75
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,690
我希望你現在能夠回憶起來
What I need you to do now is remember.

76
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:13,020
你的專長是探知人們的思想
Your speciality is getting inside heads.

77
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,840
現在  我要探知她的一切
Now... I want to get inside hers.

78
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,750
我需要了解愛麗絲的所有事
I need to know everything about Alice.

79
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:36,660
有人嗎
Hello?

80
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,100
賈法爾
Jafar?

81
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,270
我覺得他不在這里  陛下
I don't think he's here, your Majesty.

82
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:44,250
我覺得這里沒人  親愛的
I don't think anyone's here, darling.

83
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,980
賈法爾  衛兵都不見蹤影
Not Jafar, not the guards,

84
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,720
最重要的是精靈也不在了
and more importantly, the Genie.

85
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:51,300
現在我非常好奇
Now this has got me quite curious.

86
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,640
如果有誰能告訴他們去哪了
If only someone could tell me where they went.

87
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,010
我或許是賈法爾的犯人
I may be Jafar's prisoner,

88
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,940
但不是你的
but I'm not yours.

89
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,840
我不會回答你的任何問題
You will get no answers from me.

90
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,750
沒必要這么粗魯
Oh, now, no need to be rude.

91
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,870
我們彼此還不了解呢
We don't even know one another.

92
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,950
現在了解了
Yes, now we do.

93
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,190
我可以一直這樣  直到把你摔死
I can continue doing that until you're dead...

94
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,640
或者你可以張嘴說話
or you can talk.

95
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,470
賈法爾走了
Jafar is gone.

96
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,890
我不知道他去哪了
I don't know where he went.

97
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,510
但他把塞勒斯也帶走了
But he brought Cyrus with him.

98
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,530
親愛的  這籠子已經破了
Darling, the cage has been cut open.

99
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,090
賈法爾想帶他走  用鑰匙就可以了
If Jafar wanted to take him, he'd have used the key!

100
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:37,290
無所謂  你永遠抓不到他
It doesn't matter. You will never catch him.

101
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,210
為什么
Why is that?

102
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,760
因為他身上蘊藏著世間最強大的力量
Because he carries with him the greatest power of all.

103
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,460
真愛
True love.

104
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,250
他在哪
where is he?!

105
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,970
愛麗絲  你在哪
Alice, where are you?

106
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,450
我只要跟隨下山的太陽
All I have to do is follow the sun west

107
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,710
就能找到你
and I'll find you.

108
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,590
堅持住  愛麗絲
Stay strong, Alice.

109
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,370
我來找你了
I'm coming for you.

110
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,150
不許動  你這是要去哪啊
Hold on there. Where do you think you're headed?

111
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,110
我往西走
I'm heading west.

112
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,380
去找個人  你擋路了
I need to find someone, and you're blocking my way.

113
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,250
如果你一直往西走
If you keep heading west,

114
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,920
就會走進黑森林  親愛的
you'll end up in the black forest, love.

115
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:06,590
在哪里誰到找不到
You won't find anyone there.

116
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,380
據說那里是黑暗之地
They say it's so dark,

117
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,310
連自己的鼻子都看不到
you can't even find your own nose.

118
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,940
我決定碰碰運氣  謝了
I'll take my chances. Thank you.

119
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,400
這樣做似乎很冒險  對吧
That seems awful dangerous, don't it?

120
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,380
一個女孩獨自出行
A little girl traveling alone.

121
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:21,780
也許她不知道規矩
She might not know the rules.

122
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:25,310
有很多路是收費的  你得交買路錢
See, this here's a toll road. You needs to pay the toll.

123
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,750
乖乖的吧
Now be a good girl...

124
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,390
把項鏈給我們
And give us that necklace.

125
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,910
你敢碰這項鏈  我就把你手砍下來
You even touch this necklace, and you'll lose your hand.

126
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,740
說話注意點  親愛的
Careful who you threaten, luv.

127
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,240
不要舍命不舍財
No bauble's worth losing your life.

128
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,350
我就是不舍
This one is.

129
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:01,220
說話注意點  親愛的
Be carefulwho you threaten... Luv

130
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,320
謝謝你們的火把
Thanks for the light.

131
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,840
我已經失去了你一次
I already lost you once before.

132
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,110
我絕不會重蹈覆轍
I'm not gonna lose you again.

133
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,230
英格蘭  維多利亞時代
一年前

134
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,660
不
No.

135
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:38,680
塞勒斯
Cyrus?

136
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,500
塞勒斯
cyrus?

137
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,650
不
No...

138
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,910
不
No.

139
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,370
你沒事吧
Are you okay?

140
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:57,860
我沒事
Yes, I'm fine.

141
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,470
我只是
I'm just...

142
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,810
只是迷路了
just a little lost.

143
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,990
我在找回家的路
I'm trying to find my way home.

144
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:06,940
你住在附近嗎
Do you live near here?

145
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,040
以前是
I used to.

146
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,320
很早以前
A long time ago.

147
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,550
-米莉  你在哪  -米莉
- Millie, where are you? - Millie!

148
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,360
我父母  他們一定能幫你
My parents--I'm sure they can help you.

149
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:16,800
在這里
Over here!

150
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,590
米莉
Oh, Millie.

151
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,280
跟你說過不要到處亂跑的
What have we told you about running off?

152
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,900
我只是想幫忙
But I'm only trying to help.

153
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,800
她找不到家了
She can't find her way home.

154
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,330
父親
Father.

155
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:32,690
愛麗絲
Alice?

156
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,820
我的天吶  你還活著
Oh, my god. You're alive.

157
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,270
父親  他不在了
Oh, father. He's gone.

158
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,700
誰不在了
Who's gone?

159
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:43,370
塞勒斯  被她殺了
Cyrus. She killed him.

160
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:45,750
我不明白  愛麗絲
I don't understand. Alice...

161
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,070
你這么多年都去哪了
Where have you been all these years?

162
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,630
塞勒斯是誰
Who's Cyrus?

163
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:51,950
我要嫁的人
The man I was going to marry.

164
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,640
但是紅心王后  把他殺了
But the Red Queen... She killed him.

165
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,190
-把他殺了  -別說了
- She killed him. - Hush.

166
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:01,420
你回家了
You are home now.

167
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,880
我們回頭再說
We can talk about all this later.

168
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,450
父親  這個姑娘是誰
Father, who is this girl?

169
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,200
這是愛麗絲
This is Alice.

170
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,140
你的姐姐
She's your sister.

171
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,500
同父異母的姐姐
Your half-sister.

172
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,690
你從沒說起過我有個姐姐
You never told me I had a sister.

173
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,050
父親
Father...

174
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:22,030
愛麗絲  你走了以后發生了很多事
Alice, so much has changed since you left.

175
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,580
我給你介紹一下米莉
I'd like to introduce you to Millie.

176
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,790
還有
And this--

177
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,960
這是你的繼母  莎拉
this is your new mother-- Sarah.

178
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:34,500
我們現在是一家人了
This... this is your family now.

179
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,560
王后大道的盡頭

180
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,790
進入者請放棄一切希望
"Abandon all hope ye who enter."

181
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:52,320
往回走

182
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,110
我什么都不會放棄  尤其是希望
I'm not going to abandon anything, certainly not hope.

183
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,750
請注意
前方是黑森林

184
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,110
這純粹是浪費木材
Seems like an awful waste of wood,

185
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,440
豎一塊牌子還不夠嗎
when one sign would do.

186
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:02,590
前方是無盡的黑夜

187
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,390
真有這么可怕嗎
I mean, is it really that bad?

188
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:26,070
好了  愛麗絲
Okay, Alice...

189
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,150
一點點黑暗算不了什么
A little bit of darkness won't hurt anybody.

190
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,050
該死的  我的頭
Bloody hell, my head.

191
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,780
拜托  老兄  能讓我喝口水嗎
Please, mate, can I get a sip of that water?

192
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,560
你沒事吧  看起來氣色不好
Are you okay? You don't look too good.

193
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:47,790
你被石化過嗎
You ever been stoned?

194
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,320
像死了一樣的感覺
Feels like death when you come out of it.

195
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,790
可能你吸的不是真貨吧
Maybe you've been messing with the wrong stuff.

196
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,180
不  我是說"石化"  被變成石頭
No, I mean "Stoned" As in turned to stone.

197
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:58,880
好吧  好吧
Sure. Sure.

198
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:00,250
真的
Yeah.

199
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:01,830
給你
Here.

200
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,840
全都給你了
Take the whole thing.

201
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,180
紅桃杰克
Knave of Hearts.

202
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,300
請給和你一路的女魔頭
We've got a message for that she-devil

203
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,250
帶個口信
you've been traveling with.

204
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,430
愛麗絲  你們見到她了嗎
Alice? You've seen her?

205
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:21,890
她是個瘋子
She's mad, that one.

206
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,710
趁我們睡覺的時候  無緣無故的攻擊我們
Attacked us for no reason while we were sleeping.

207
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,680
你告訴她  如果讓我們再見到她
You tell her, If we meet again,

208
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,200
我們絕不會手軟
we won't go easy.

209
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,050
沒問題
Of course.

210
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:34,240
不過你們兩個混蛋得先給我指個路
If you lads could point me in the right direction.

211
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,020
她剛剛救了我的命  我得找到她
Look, she just saved my life. I have to find her.

212
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,140
祝你好運吧
Well, good luck with that.

213
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:40,960
她往黑森林去了
She's headed to the black forest.

214
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,550
黑森林
The black forest?

215
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,120
該死的
Bloody hell.

216
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,890
對  如我們所說
Yeah. Like we said,

217
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,540
好運吧
good luck.

218
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,240
一直走直線
Keep walking in a straight line.

219
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,860
一直  朝  西走
Keep... walking... west.

220
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,760
不
Oh, no.

221
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,850
不要滅啊  求你了
Please stay alight. Please.

222
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,750
不要  不要  不要
No, no, no. No!

223
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,280
我過來了
I made it through.

224
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:53,410
我就知道不遠了
I knew I was close.

225
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,480
感覺太棒了
That feels so wonderful.

226
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,000
很美吧
Beautiful, isn't it?

227
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:33,760
讓你感覺非常  閑適
Makes you feel quite... mimsy.

228
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:34,770
你是誰
Who are you?

229
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,380
我是木匠
I'm the carpenter.

230
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,550
你是誰
Who are you?

231
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,130
我不太想讓你知道我的名字
I'm not sure I want to give you my name.

232
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,140
你知道這是什么地方嗎
Do you know where we are?

233
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,330
我一直試圖定位方向
I've been trying to find my bearings.

234
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,660
這里是米堡果林
We are in the Boro Grove,

235
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,960
世上最美的地方
The most beautiful place in the world.

236
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:54,750
何不放下你的寶劍
Why don't you put down your sword

237
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,560
感覺一下
and stay a while?

238
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:58,870
我不可能留下來
I couldn't possibly.

239
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,380
我有很重要的事要做
I've got quite important things to do.

240
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,440
有什么事比曬太陽更重要呢
What could be more important than basking in the sun?

241
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:09,010
救人
S-s... saving... someone's life.

242
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,470
我一直跟著太陽
I-I've been, uh, following the sun,

243
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,910
我是說
and, uh, I mean...

244
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,260
我正在尋找
I'm trying to find, uh...

245
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,820
一個精靈
there's... Uh, there's this genie,

246
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,630
可是他
and he's, uh...

247
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,110
他遇到了麻煩
he's in trouble, and, uh...

248
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,910
至少我覺得他遇到了麻煩
uh, uh... at least I thought he was.

249
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,760
我突然不太記得了
Uh, s-suddenly I can't quite remember.

250
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,440
那你就要留下
Then you must stay.

251
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,950
這里挺漂亮的
It is quite beautiful here.

252
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:59,170
也許我該在這兒待會兒
Maybe I will stay a while.

253
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,060
她打算在這待多久
How long is she planning to stay?

254
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,000
我還不知道
I don't know yet.

255
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,260
你不擔心她嗎
Aren't you concerned about her--

256
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,590
先讓我和她聊聊吧
Let me talk to her. Please.

257
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,950
但愿我們有個像樣的臥室
I wish we had a proper bedroom...

258
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:23,730
或是換洗的衣物
or a change of clothes.

259
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,950
當然我們可以給你買新的
We can get you new things, of course.

260
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,370
我想知道的是
What I would like to know...

261
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,410
你這次打算在這留多久
how long are you planning on staying this time?

262
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,180
再也不走了
Forever.

263
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,060
仙境沒有值得我留戀的東西了
There's nothing left for me in Wonderland.

264
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,490
愛麗絲
Alice...

265
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,520
有些事情你必須要明白
there's something you must understand.

266
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:50,970
我已經有了一個新家
I have a new family now,

267
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:53,300
他們也會像我一樣愛你
and they will love you as I do.

268
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:55,980
可是米莉
But Millie...

269
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:59,380
她年紀還很小  而且容易受到影響
is quite young and impressionable.

270
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,040
如果你真的要留下來
If you truly want to stay,

271
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,780
就不能再提仙境
there can be no more mention of Wonderland...

272
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,290
或是那個精靈
or this... genie.

273
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:10,260
他叫塞勒斯
He had a name. Cyrus.

274
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,210
愛麗絲
Alice...

275
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,310
不管你到底去了哪里
wherever you really were...

276
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:16,160
不管發生了什么事
whatever really happened,

277
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,680
你最好把這些事都忘了
these things are best forgotten.

278
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,640
難道我要將他遺忘
So I should just sweep him under the rug,

279
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,730
就像你對媽媽
like you did with mother...

280
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,480
和對我那樣嗎
and with me?

281
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,980
我沉溺于過去痛苦的回憶中
I spent a long time clinging

282
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,120
已經太久了
to painful memories.

283
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,330
直到有一天我才發現  我必須放手
And then one day I realized I had to stop clinging...

284
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,770
才能擁有快樂
to be happy.

285
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:45,230
但要是沒有了他
I don't think I can be happy again...

286
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,880
我再也不會快樂了
and not without him.

287
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:53,570
你會快樂的
You will be...

288
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,600
只要你愿意住在這個家里
if you want to live in this house.

289
00:17:58,810 --> 00:17:59,740
你能做到嗎
Can you do that?

290
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,860
你能試著融入我們
Can you try to fit in,

291
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,120
在這個家里重拾歡樂嗎
to be happy in our home?

292
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,750
我已經無處可去了
I have nowhere else to go.

293
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,570
我會試試
I'll try.

294
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,320
那么你會忘記仙境
And you will forget about Wonderland?

295
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:18,030
忘記塞勒斯嗎
And this Cyrus?

296
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,580
愛麗絲
Alice.

297
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:27,600
我回來你高興嗎  父親
Are you glad... I'm back, father?

298
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:34,820
你真的想要我留下嗎
Do you really want me here?

299
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,410
我當然想  愛麗絲
Of course I do, Alice.

300
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,470
當然了
Of course.

301
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,530
塞勒斯是從這逃走的
Cyrus ran this way.

302
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,400
賈法爾那些卑鄙的守衛都在緊追其后
Jafar's filthy guards-- they all ran after him.

303
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,270
好極了  那他們很快就能抓到他了
Good. Then they'll have him apprehended in no time.

304
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,150
恰恰相反  我的小傻瓜
That, my little dimwit,

305
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,870
我們才不想他被抓到
is precisely what we do not want.

306
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,830
我不明白
I don't understand.

307
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,700
你當然不懂了  你倆雙胞胎兄弟啥都不懂
Of course you don't. You tweedles never do--

308
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,510
一個比一個笨
Each one dumber than the next.

309
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,620
可是王后陛下  你不能獨自去追捕他
But your majesty can't go after him alone, and...

310
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,670
而且這身打扮也不適合一位王后
that outfit is not befitting a queen.

311
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,370
不要對我
Do not tell me

312
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:16,730
指手畫腳
what I can and can't do!

313
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,600
每個人都在低估我
Everyone keeps underestimating me.

314
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,600
我又不是一開始就是王后
I was not always queen.

315
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,070
我知道怎么做那些骯臟的勾當
I know how to get my hands dirty.

316
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,770
是的
Of course.

317
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:26,910
如果我獨自抓到精靈
If I alone capture the genie,

318
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:28,770
我就會得到他和他的瓶子
I will have him and his bottle.

319
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,610
我就會得到一切
I will have everything.

320
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:34,320
賈法爾將會一無所有  而我將會
Jafar will have nothing, and I win...

321
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:35,790
成為這場游戲的贏家
the game.

322
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,740
愛麗絲
Alice!

323
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,130
愛麗絲
Alice!

324
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,470
愛麗絲  你
Alice, are you--

325
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:55,800
搞什么鬼
What the hell?

326
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:57,710
是瓶該死的香水嗎
Is this a bloody perfume bottle?

327
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,250
你來了
You're here!

328
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,000
找到你了
Found ya.

329
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:08,730
你安然無恙
And you're in one piece.

330
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,610
看來我們倆都沒事了
I guess we're both okay.

331
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:11,820
我還擔心你來著
You had me worried for a bit.

332
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:14,120
什么也不要擔心
Don't worry about anything.

333
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,250
這里的一切都太美好了
Everything is wonderful here.

334
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,200
你一定要來看看這個
You've got to see this!

335
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:21,280
慢一點
Slow down.

336
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,090
快來
Come on!

337
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,530
這是什么鬼東西
What the hell is that?

338
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,300
我做的  是不是很漂亮
I made it. Isn't it pretty?

339
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:36,110
這里到底是怎么回事
What the bloody hell is going on here?

340
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,080
他是誰
Who's that?

341
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:44,000
只是個木匠  不用擔心他
Oh. That's just the carpenter. Don't worry about him.

342
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,840
不要擔心一個拿著鋸子
Right. Don't worry about the man

343
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,570
笑容詭異的人
with the saw and the scary grin.

344
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,190
說對了
Exactly.

345
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,730
你在這多久了  愛麗絲
How long have you been here, Alice?

346
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,620
不記得了
I don't remember.

347
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,210
有一會了吧
A while.

348
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,400
你把項鏈摘下來  就這樣什么都不干
And you took the necklace off and just stopped everything

349
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,480
只摘花嗎
to pick flowers?

350
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,290
可塞勒斯還被關押著對嗎
With Cyrus still a prisoner?

351
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,640
是的
Yes?

352
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,400
為什么要這樣
Why would you do that?

353
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:16,040
因為這樣我會很開心
Because it makes me happy.

354
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:24,090
回到家  我真的很高興
I really am so happy to be back.

355
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,090
謝謝你給我的新裙子
Thank you for my new dress.

356
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,990
我非常喜歡這些雛菊的香味
I really love the smell of those daisies.

357
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:34,910
那是大麗花  親愛的
They're dahlias, dear.

358
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:39,190
大麗花  當然了  我一定會記住的
Dahlias. Of course. I must remember that.

359
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:42,800
我覺得你穿那條裙子很漂亮  愛麗絲
I think you look beautiful in that dress, Alice.

360
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,710
當然很漂亮
Of course she does,

361
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,880
所以我想我們該談談她的社會責任
which is why I think we should talk about her social obligations...

362
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:51,340
既然她死而復生了
now that she's back from the dead.

363
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:55,170
-社會責任  -我不是想討人厭
- Social obligations? - Well, I don't want to put a fine point on it,

364
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:57,460
但你已經不是個小姑娘了
but you're not a little girl anymore.

365
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,930
是的  當然不是
No, of course not.

366
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,220
一個年輕女性應該考慮一下自己的未來
And a young woman should think about her future.

367
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,010
莎拉  拜托  她才剛剛回來
Sarah... Please. She's only just returned.

368
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:06,680
所以我們更加應該幫忙
All the more reason we have to help.

369
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,010
幫忙  怎么說
Help? With what, exactly?

370
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,970
當然是把你介紹給合適的年輕人  
Meeting a suitable young man, of course.

371
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:13,900
讓你繼續生活
Moving on with your life.

372
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,500
我已經跟住在路那頭的達西夫人說了
I've been speaking with Mrs. Darcy down the road.

373
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,920
她的兒子還沒結婚  有工作  
Her son is unmarried, employed,

374
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,290
而且也不太難看
and not awful to look at.

375
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:23,730
我們已經說好哪天一起喝茶了
We've arranged for a tea.

376
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:28,310
我只是...我不能這樣
I just... I just couldn't.

377
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,540
恐怕你必須如此
I'm afraid you must.

378
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,160
我都已經安排好了
I've already made the arrangements.

379
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:33,430
只是喝茶罷了 愛麗絲 
It's just tea, Alice.

380
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,610
你肯定能做到的
Surely you can manage that much.

381
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,530
達西家的兒子會出來幫著打圓場的
The Darcy boy will carry on both halves of the conversation.

382
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,720
你只需要微笑就可以了
All you have to do is smile.

383
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,020
這對你有好處  愛麗絲
This could be good for you, Alice--

384
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,870
是一種  你知道的
A way to, you know...

385
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,970
讓你忘掉煩惱的方法
forget your troubles.

386
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:48,910
愛麗絲
Alice.

387
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,010
到底怎么回事
What on earth?

388
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,580
天啊  我很抱歉
oh, god. I'm so sorry.

389
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:55,850
我只是現在還沒準備好見任何年輕男士
I'm simply not ready for meeting any young men right now.

390
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,530
我想忘掉某些煩惱需要多花一點時間
I think some troubles take a bit longer to forget.

391
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,000
他往哪邊走了
Where did he go?

392
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,250
他往這邊跑了
well, he went this way!

393
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,380
這邊
This way.

394
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,530
他過河了  你們倆往那邊走  
He's in the river. You two that way.

395
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:42,060
好的  長官
Yes, sir.

396
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,640
你們跟著我  找到他的時候
You lot with me. And when you find him,

397
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,070
記住  那個混蛋殺了我們一個兄弟
remember, that bastard killed one of ours.

398
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,100
讓他見見血
So make him bleed.

399
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,610
遵命  長官  跟我來
Yes, sir. Come with me.

400
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,910
走吧  愛麗絲  我們得去找塞勒斯
come on, Alice. We've got to find Cyrus.

401
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:56,270
再過一會兒吧
Maybe in a little while.

402
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,640
你摸過這些樹的樹皮嗎  非常可愛
Have you felt the bark on this tree? It's lovely.

403
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,430
我不想摸這些破樹皮
I don't want to feel the bloody bark.

404
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:02,940
我想讓你恢復過來
I want you to snap out of it.

405
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,340
恢復什么啊
Snap out of what?

406
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,990
-愛麗絲  你怎么了  -沒什么
- Alice, what's wrong with you? - Nothing.

407
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:09,470
頭一遭啊  我的生活中什么麻煩都沒有
For the first time in my life, nothing's wrong.

408
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:11,210
我很開心  他很開心
I'm happy. He's happy.

409
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:12,390
為什么你不開心
Why aren't you?

410
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,860
你對愛麗絲做了什么
What have you done to Alice?

411
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,490
我問你  你對她做了什么
I said, what did you do to her?

412
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:27,400
聽著  我一般比較善良
Listen, I'm more of a lover, generally.

413
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:29,030
但如果你不說的話  
but if you don't talk,

414
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,480
我就會把你揍到說出答案為止
I will knock an answer out of you.

415
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,910
伙計  你那里有東西
Mate, you got something.

416
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,380
該死
Bloody hell!

417
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:49,850
天啊
Oh, god.

418
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,670
這可不妙
This is not good.

419
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:04,100
它讓你想要留下來
It makes you want to stay.

420
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,070
愛麗絲
Alice!

421
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:09,020
愛麗絲  愛麗絲
Alice! Alice!

422
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:12,150
愛麗絲  愛麗絲  我們得立刻離開這里
Alice, Alice, we have to get out of here right bloody now.

423
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,600
愛麗絲
Alice.

424
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,790
愛麗絲是誰
Who's Alice?

425
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,280
不  塞勒斯
No. Cyrus.

426
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:36,940
塞勒斯
Cyrus!

427
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:37,710
不
No!

428
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:40,350
塞勒斯
Cyrus.

429
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:41,800
愛麗絲
Alice?

430
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:42,540
愛麗絲
Alice!

431
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,430
米莉
Millie.

432
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,000
你在這兒干什么
What are you doing in here?

433
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,330
我聽到你在尖叫
I heard you screaming.

434
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,470
我做噩夢了  沒什么  回去睡覺吧
It's just a bad dream, that's all. Go back to bed.

435
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,460
爸爸說我們不該害怕惡夢
Father says you should never be afraid of your bad dreams,

436
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:02,710
因為那不是真的
because they're not real.

437
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:05,860
的確像是父親的話
That certainly sounds like father.

438
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:09,260
但是你的惡夢是真的嗎
Are your bad dreams real, though?

439
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:12,020
所以你才在吃飯的時候捏碎了那個杯子
Is that why you broke that glass at dinner?

440
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,650
別說了  去睡吧
That's enough. Off to bed.

441
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:18,040
至少告訴我  誰是塞勒斯
At least tell me who Cyrus is.

442
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,330
你說什么
What did you say?

443
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:24,030
塞勒斯  你一直在叫他的名字
Cyrus. You kept yelling his name.

444
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,600
他是誰
Who is he?

445
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,640
他是個很特別的人
He's someone very special.

446
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:37,470
一個讓人難以忘懷的人
Someone impossible to forget,

447
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,230
不管我怎么努力
no matter how hard I might try.

448
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,190
希望我有天也能碰見這樣一個人
I hope I meet someone like that someday.

449
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,910
我相信你會的
I'm sure you will.

450
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,070
當你遇見他們的時候
And when you meet them,

451
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,700
你就再無所求
you won't wish for anything else in the whole world.

452
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:56,870
米莉  馬上上床去
Millie. Get to bed this instant.

453
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,330
好的
Yes.

454
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:02,620
對不起  
I'm sorry.

455
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,630
我們不需要你說對不起  愛麗絲
We don't need you to be sorry, Alice.

456
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,960
我們需要你變得好
We need you to be better.

457
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,030
如果你不愿意放棄這些傻事
And if you won't stop believing this foolishness,

458
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:11,630
至少不要對別人提及
at least have the decency to keep it to yourself.

459
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,460
我希望變好
I want to be.

460
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,680
我想要快樂
I want to be happy.

461
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,600
我在努力
I am trying.

462
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,160
努力的不夠
Not nearly hard enough.

463
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,600
我們真以為你能忘記這些荒唐事  愛麗絲
We really thought you could forget this nonsense, Alice.

464
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,740
看來我們錯了
It appears we were wrong.

465
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:36,730
好了  夠了
All right, that's enough.

466
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,850
你不記得塞勒斯  也不記得自己
You don't remember Cyrus. You don't remember yourself.

467
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:40,460
但別再爭了  我們走
Well, no more arguments. We're going.

468
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:40,770
去哪
Go where?

469
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:42,610
離開這鬼地方  看啊  愛麗絲
The hell out of here. Look, Alice!

470
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:45,000
看到這些樹了嗎  它們以前都是人
You see all these trees? They all used to be people.

471
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:46,960
如果留下來  你也會變這樣
That's what's gonna happen to you if you stay.

472
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,130
所以我得把你帶出去
So I'm getting you're out.

473
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:49,550
不要
No!

474
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,070
我不想走
I don't want to go!

475
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,290
我不走  離我遠點
I'm not leaving! Stay away from me!

476
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:55,430
冷靜  冷靜點
Easy. Easy!

477
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:57,240
我不會走的  別想逼我離開
I won't go! You can't make me go!

478
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,970
別管我  讓我留下來
Just leave me alone! Let me stay!

479
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,190
我不想傷害你  愛麗絲
I don't wanna hurt you, Alice,

480
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:02,130
但你已經不像你自己了
but you're not yourself.

481
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:04,880
我變得更好了  這才是我想要成為的人
I'm better! I'm the person I've always wanted to be!

482
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:05,910
我現在很開心
I'm happy!

483
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:07,710
這個地方讓你以為自己很快樂
This place is making you happy!

484
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:09,000
這不是真的快樂
It's not real happiness!

485
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:11,250
相信我  我知道區別在哪
Believe me. I know the difference when I see it.

486
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,450
有什么區別
And why is that?!

487
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,570
聽著  有些事我從沒告訴過你
Listen. There's something I never told you before.

488
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,250
當我的心臟被奪走時
When my heart was ripped from me--

489
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:20,160
我是說  真的從我胸膛里被奪走時
I mean, literally taken from my chest--

490
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,830
我以為這個空洞永遠都不會再被填滿了
I thought that hole could never be filled.

491
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,860
但是你幫我拿了回來
And then you got it back for me.

492
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:27,280
從那時起  我沒有好好地用心
Since then, I didn't really use it properly.

493
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:29,480
我一直覺得很愧疚
I always felt guilty about that.

494
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,790
好像我受之有愧
Like you gave me something more than I deserved.

495
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:35,210
好像我欠了你什么
Like I still owe you something.

496
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,960
也許正因如此我不能讓你去送死
Maybe that's why I can't let this happen.

497
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:41,070
住手
Stop!

498
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,700
把劍給我  愛麗絲
Give me the sword, Alice!

499
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:57,430
愛麗絲  我不能逼你離開
Alice, I can't make you go.

500
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:58,510
沒錯
Exactly.

501
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:00,000
不  我說真的  我不能逼你
No, I mean it. I can't make you.

502
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,960
我不能帶你走  不能強迫你離開
I can't take you. I can't force you.

503
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,670
因為在這個地方
Because this place--

504
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:05,530
唯一脫身的方法就是自愿離開
the only way out is wanting to go.

505
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:07,800
所以求你了  愛麗絲  跟我走吧
So please, Alice, just come with me.

506
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,380
該死的  愛麗絲  看看你自己
Oh, bloody hell, Alice. Look at ya!

507
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:18,750
跟我走吧
Please just come with me.

508
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,380
不要
No.

509
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,610
我哪都不會去
I'm not going anywhere.

510
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,900
我終于找到家了
I finally found a home.

511
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:01,360
如果我是個受到驚嚇的小精靈
Now if I were a frightened little genie...

512
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,730
我會逃去哪呢
which way I would run?

513
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,040
真聰明
Clever.

514
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,210
但還不夠
But not clever enough.

515
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,450
她在這里
Ah. There she is.

516
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:52,130
看來她沒等我們吃早餐
Looks like she started breakfast without us.

517
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,500
愛麗絲  這就是我跟你說過的那個男孩
Alice. This is the boy I was telling you about--

518
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,040
達西夫人的兒子
Mrs. Darcy's son.

519
00:30:58,050 --> 00:30:59,230
他只是順便路過
He just stopped by.

520
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,230
我們覺得如果你感覺好些了
We thought he could join us for breakfast...

521
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,620
可以邀他一起吃早餐
if you were feeling better.

522
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:06,110
早上好  愛麗絲  很高興見到你
Good morning, Alice. Nice to meet you.

523
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,340
是你把他帶過來的
You brought him here?

524
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:13,970
你在想什么
And you thought what?

525
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:16,090
你以為這能讓情況好轉嗎
That it would make things better?

526
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,710
幫我忘卻往事嗎
Help me forget?

527
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,950
你真的一點都不了解我
You really don't know me at all.

528
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,120
你要去哪
Where are you going?

529
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,140
反正不留在這兒
Anywhere else.

530
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,360
但是你無處可去了
But you have nowhere else to go.

531
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,620
你自己不也說過嗎
Isn't that what you said?

532
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:45,590
快進去道歉
Go back in and apologize.

533
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:46,500
不可能
I won't.

534
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,730
你娶了一個自己不愛的人
Just because you married someone you don't love

535
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:50,010
不代表我也要這樣做
doesn't mean I have to.

536
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:51,190
你在說什么
What are you talking about?

537
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:52,490
她不能讓你真的感到幸福
She doesn't make you truly happy.

538
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:53,620
她當然能了
Of course she does.

539
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,070
不能像媽媽那樣
Not like mother.

540
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,770
我們不能在哀悼中
We can't... spend our whole life

541
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,110
度過余生  愛麗絲
in mourning, Alice.

542
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,700
你必須得走出陰影
You must find a way to move forward...

543
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:10,470
像我一樣
as I did.

544
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,110
你用了好多年才忘掉媽媽
It took you years to get over mother.

545
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:17,950
在我小時候  你一直愁眉不展
You were sad my entire childhood.

546
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:20,070
你為什么覺得我在幾天內
Why do you think I can forget Cyrus

547
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,510
就能忘記塞勒斯
in just a few days?

548
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:24,470
因為不像他  你媽媽是真實存在的
Because unlike him, your mother was bloody real!

549
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:26,170
塞勒斯也是
Cyrus was real.

550
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:27,330
不  他不是
No, he's not!

551
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:28,620
你得想辦法忘記
You need to find a way to give up

552
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,290
你想象中的愛情故事  愛麗絲
this imaginary love story, Alice,

553
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:32,600
然后開始你自己的生活
and move on with your life.

554
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,070
要是我做不到呢
What if it's not possible?

555
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,470
如果一個人不管多努力
What if a person can't forget their love,

556
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:37,580
都無法忘記她的真愛呢
no matter how much easier it would be?

557
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,740
你必須忘記
You must.

558
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:40,290
我做不到
I can't.

559
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,070
那你就不能和我們一起
Then you can no longer live under our roof

560
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,800
住在這房子里
with our family.

561
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:49,870
這是你說的  還是她
Is that you talking, or her?

562
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:55,760
還有另一個好辦法
There's one other.. good option.

563
00:32:57,190 --> 00:33:00,580
倫敦有個醫生  叫利德蓋特
A doctor in London-- Lydgate.

564
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,450
他開了一家精神療養院
He runs a psychiatric hospital.

565
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:03,560
瘋人院
A madhouse?

566
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,840
那和書上寫的不一樣
It's not like it is in the books.

567
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,710
那個地方很好  很現代化
This place is very nice, very modern.

568
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:10,700
但是我沒瘋  你為什么不能相信我
But I'm not mad! Why can't you just believe--

569
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,600
你想讓我相信什么
And what part do you want me to believe?

570
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,820
精靈還是會說話的兔子
The genie or the talking rabbit?

571
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:15,560
相信我
Me.

572
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,650
你應該相信我
You should believe in me!

573
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:21,290
對不起
I'm sorry.

574
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,170
我們不能再這樣下去了
We can't go on like this.

575
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,070
我必須為米莉著想
I have to think of Millie.

576
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:29,100
你會把我送進瘋人院
You'll just send me to a madhouse.

577
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,380
不是把你送去
Not send you.

578
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:32,960
只是給你一個選擇
Offer you a choice.

579
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:35,040
你可以讓莎拉幫你找個丈夫
You can let Sarah find you a husband,

580
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:36,610
或者是去醫院
or you can live in a hospital.

581
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,670
但是你不能留在這
But you can't sit here

582
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:41,610
渴望活在一個虛構的世界里  愛麗絲
pining for a make-believe life, Alice.

583
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,050
愛麗絲  決定權完全在你手上
The choice, Alice... is entirely yours.

584
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,740
沒時間了  愛麗絲
Running out of time, Alice.

585
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:58,770
你必須做出選擇
You have to make a choice.

586
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,630
別過來
Don't come any closer.

587
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,980
只有你想留下  這個地方才能留住你
This place can only make you stay if you want to.

588
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:07,490
所以我要幫你想起來
So I'm gonna help you remember,

589
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:08,760
就算要以生命為代價
even if it kills me.

590
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:11,970
記得這是誰給你的嗎
You know who gave you this?

591
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,330
是塞勒斯
His name was Cyrus.

592
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,580
而你為了找到他  一直在艱苦地戰斗
And you've been fighting like hell to get to him.

593
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,920
別說了  我在這里很開心
Stop it. I'm happy here.

594
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,290
你可以殺了我
You can kill me.

595
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:25,470
變成一棵該死的樹
Become a bloody tree.

596
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,050
永遠待在這里
Stay here forever.

597
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:29,310
但是沒有塞勒斯  你是不會真的快樂
But you'll never be truly happy until you're with him.

598
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:34,640
我認識的愛麗絲絕不會在這一點上讓步
The Alice I know would never give up on that.

599
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,300
拜托  別說了
Please stop it.

600
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:40,170
不
No.

601
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:02,860
塞勒斯
Cyrus.

602
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:09,090
這是什么東西
What are these?

603
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,680
放開我  讓我走
Get off me! Let me go!

604
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,860
就是這樣  棒極了  愛麗絲
Yes, that's it. Bloody brilliant, Alice!

605
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,630
我要去找他
I need to find him.

606
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:34,290
小心點  注意腳下
Careful now. Watch your step.

607
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,310
是你
You.

608
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:39,820
沒錯  就是我
Yes. Me.

609
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,940
是不是似曾相識
Look familiar?

610
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,560
一切都會好起來的  埃德溫
It's going to be all right, Edwin.

611
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:29,370
你確定嗎
Are you certain?

612
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:31,570
我們都很清楚留她不能留在這里
We both know she couldn't stay here.

613
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:33,280
她在那里會更開心的
She's going to be much happier.

614
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,010
所以你覺得她是做出了正確的選擇
So you think she made the right decision?

615
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:37,710
我知道她做對了
I know she did.

616
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,170
我為她的聰明感到驚訝
I was actually surprised at her wisdom.

617
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,780
都會好起來的
It's going to be fine.

618
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:48,250
她不能永遠做一個小女孩  埃德溫
She can't be a little girl forever, Edwin,

619
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:50,460
而且醫生會好好照顧她的
And he'll take excellent care of her.

620
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,400
我也希望如此
I certainly hope so.

621
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,960
她甚至都不想我到醫院去看她
She doesn't even want me to visit the hospital, you know.

622
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:36,280
她還太過年輕魯莽
She's still young and impetuous,

623
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,220
所以這樣對她來說才是最好的
which is why this is best.

624
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,270
是時候讓她成長起來了
It's time for her to grow up.

625
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,230
媽媽
Mommy?

626
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,100
謝謝
Thank you.

627
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,590
只是想報答你的救命之恩
Just trying to get square for once.

628
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,410
這樣我就少欠你一個人情
That's one less I owe ya.

629
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:12,000
我還從沒體會過那種感覺
I've never felt anything like that.

630
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:17,000
所有的煩惱  就在一瞬間消失了
All my troubles just-- just lifted away.

631
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:20,550
現在它們一下子又回來了
Now it's all just coming back all at once.

632
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,530
我的心好痛
There's this pain in my heart.

633
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:26,510
你也有這種感覺嗎
Do you feel it, too?

634
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,990
一點沒有
Nothing like that.

635
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,340
但你會沒事的
But you're gonna be fine.

636
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,450
我剛解除石化狀態時感覺也很糟
I mean, I felt like hell when I got out of that statue,

637
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:37,070
但瞧瞧我現在  煥如新生
But look at me now. Good as new.

638
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,010
謝謝你
Thank you for that.

639
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:39,630
謝什么
For what?

640
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,660
把我變回來
For turning me back.

641
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:42,980
不是我做的
That wasn't me.

642
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,140
不是你嗎  那是誰
Wasn't you? Then who was it?

643
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,580
安娜斯塔西婭拿到了魔塵
Anastasia had a bit of magic dust.

644
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,630
該死的
Bloody hell.

645
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:50,310
什么
What?

646
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:51,570
你想繼續當一座石像嗎
You want to remain a statue?

647
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:53,130
我不想和她扯上關系
I want nothing to do with her.

648
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,540
她也許還愛著你  威爾
Perhaps she's still in love with you, Will.

649
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:58,770
我已經不再愛她了
Well, not only don't I love her back--

650
00:38:58,770 --> 00:38:59,650
我做不到
I can't.

651
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,680
很早以前我就確認了這一點
I made sure of that a long time ago.

652
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,630
這是什么意思
What does that mean?

653
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,630
跟你的心有關  對不對
It's about your heart, isn't it?

654
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:07,710
你說過有些事你還沒告訴我
You said there was something you didn't tell me.

655
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:09,970
威爾  你欠我一個解釋
Will? You owe me an explanation.

656
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,260
聽著
Look...

657
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:14,440
我知道你歷經許多艱險
I know you went to a lot of trouble

658
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,780
才找回我的心
to get my heart back, but...

659
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:19,080
但把我的心放回去并不能改變什么
But that place back there can't possibly affect it.

660
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,650
因為你根本就沒有把心放回去
Because you never put it back in.

661
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,730
你都在想些什么啊
What were you thinking?

662
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:30,430
安娜斯塔西婭讓我的心碎了
Anastasia broke my heart.

663
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,860
我知道一旦把心放回胸膛
I knew the minute I put it back in me chest,

664
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,070
我就會重新體會到心碎的感覺
I'd feel all that again.

665
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:37,370
你不想去感受
You didn't want to feel?

666
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:38,220
我不想
Not that.

667
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,600
所以我想  為什么不把這苦難留到明天
So I thought, why not put off the misery until tomorrow?

668
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,430
然后是后天  然后是大后天
Then the next tomorrow. Then the next.

669
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:46,490
過了一陣之后  我就有點習慣了
And after a while, I... I kinda got used to it...

670
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,170
那種空蕩蕩的感覺
the emptiness.

671
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,350
如果你沒有把心放回胸膛的話
So if you didn't put your heart back in,

672
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:53,600
你把它藏到哪兒了
where did you put it?

673
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:57,040
晚點再告訴你  先看看這東西
I'll tell you later, because look at that bloody thing.

674
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,790
想要逃回到愛麗絲身邊
It was a wonderful fantasy you had--

675
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:11,250
真是異想天開
escaping back to Alice.

676
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:12,960
這絕不只是異想天開
It's much more than a fantasy.

677
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,210
我會再見到她的
I will see her again.

678
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,470
現在你被困在一座漂浮小島上
You're trapped on a floating island

679
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:19,070
無路可逃
with nowhere to escape.

680
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,740
親愛的  殘酷的現實就是
Darling, the harsh reality is

681
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:23,210
有時候僅僅有愛情是不夠的
sometimes love is not enough.

682
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,550
恐怕你錯了
I'm afraid you're wrong.

683
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:56,590
有什么事嗎
Can I help you?

684
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,270
事實上  我相信我可以幫到你
Actually, I believe I can help you.

685
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:02,820
抱歉  我們認識嗎
I'm sorry. Do we know one another?

686
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:05,520
不認識  但我認識你的女兒
No. But I know your daughter,

687
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:08,360
而且我知道她逃出瘋人院后
and I know where she went after she escaped

688
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,470
去了什么地方
from that asylum.

689
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:11,660
愛麗絲嗎
Alice?

690
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:14,120
你見過愛麗絲
You've seen Alice?

691
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:14,970
是的
Yes.

692
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,340
我還可以帶你去見她
And I can take you to her.

693
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:29,780
仙

694
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:29,780
境

695
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:29,780
奇

696
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:29,780
