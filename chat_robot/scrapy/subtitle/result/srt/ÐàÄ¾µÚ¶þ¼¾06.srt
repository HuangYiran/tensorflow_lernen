1
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,316
你 AI 是展示人体强大的恢复力的实例
You, Al, are an object lesson in the healing powers of obstinacy...

2
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,231
也是战胜病魔的典型
and a hostile disposition.

3
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,637
我仍然四肢无力
My leg and arm are waxy.

4
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,518
你对它们感觉如何并不重要
How they feel to you is not the relevant measure.

5
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,871
我会依据他们对刺激的反应进行实际的判断
I judge objectively the way they respond to stimuli...

6
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,077
它们好多了
and they are much fucking improved.

7
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,199
总体来讲  先生  我称之为奇迹
In the overall, sir, I call you a miracle.

8
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,592
准备觐见吧
Ready to meet the world.

9
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,475
沃尔科特先生 你希望我买债权这事再干多长时间
How much longer you suppose I'll be buying claims, Mr Wolcott?

10
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,673
快完事了
We're close to the end.

11
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,560
再不完事  我就要穷得穿内裤在这跳舞了
Otherwise, I'll need to start dancing out here in long johns...

12
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,358
而不是像现在这样抱怨了
or baying at the moon.

13
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,393
也会透漏给人们我要逆势而为的信息了
Give people some idea of why I'm going against logic.

14
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,311
这个阶段要结束了
This phase is nearly over...

15
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,873
同时另一阶段将要开始
even as another begins.

16
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,670
我提出建立银行的计划
I propose formation of a bank...

17
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,152
斯塔尔先生  你任执行官
Mr Star, with yourself as chief officer...

18
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,278
我在营地的财产做抵押
my holdings in the camp standing surety...

19
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,030
埃尔斯沃斯先生担任我的股份的监管人
and Mr Ellsworth as overseer of my interests.

20
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,314
我明白
I see.

21
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,111
可惜我没做个振奋人心的发言
Not quite a rousing endorsement.

22
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,770
盖勒特夫人  那就不必了
It's just what's needed, Mrs Garret. 

23
00:02:55,771 --> 00:02:57,871
我不知道我该不该参与
I don't know that I should be part of it.

24
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,214
为什么呢  斯塔尔先生？
Why, Mr Star?

25
00:03:01,215 --> 00:03:02,558
我有其他的义务在身
Other obligations.

26
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,238
你
Oughtn't you...

27
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,234
或者其他任何想利用人情限制你资格的人
or anyone urging such connections as disqualifying you...

28
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,231
就不考虑一下营地给我们带来的好处么？
think of the good of the camp?

29
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,878
我们都有
We all have...

30
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,194
复杂的义务
complicating obligations.

31
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,434
这些会是我的新员工么？
Might those be my new employees?

32
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,197
两虎之间必有一争啊
There's a combat in prospect between those two.

33
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,994
就好比苏族和白人
As equal as the Sioux with the Whites.

34
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,429
怎么样？
All right?

35
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,389
Well  你左边高大约半头
Well, you left upright, about half a cunt hair.

36
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,079
Well  那就把我扶正了
Well, bring me fucking straight then.

37
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,479
我给他弄吧  丹
I got him, Dan.

38
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,435
Whoa.
Whoa.

39
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,431
对了  就这样  笔直
Right, there you go. Straight as a string.

40
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,839
退后吧  约翰尼
Stand back then, Johnny.

41
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,296
有口水流下来么  有血点么
Any drool, first fucking fleck,

42
00:04:45,297 --> 00:04:46,673
你按住我的时候留下的？
you give me this.

43
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,910
你从来就没流过口水  艾尔
You never showed no fucking spittle, Al.

44
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,997
要按我说的做哦
Do as I fucking say.

45
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,514
好的  先生
Yes, sir.

46
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,109
我进去
I'm going in.

47
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,630
那为啥是我坐在最前排呢？
Then why am I in first chair?

48
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,476
你们能给他口交么？
Anyone else suck his prick?

49
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,315
托利维先生  你抛弃了我
You washed your hands of me, Mr Tolliver...

50
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,550
当我被暴民包围的时候
when I was beset amid that rabble...

51
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,837
卑鄙可比本丢・彼拉多(钉死耶稣的罗马犹太总督)
no less contemptibly than Pontius Pilate.

52
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,631
有时候影子是保护之手投下的
Sometimes the shadow's cast by the sheltering hand.

53
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,709
你是说暴民在你的控制之下？
Meaning the rabble was under your control?

54
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,836
不是  先生  我控制不了他们
No, sir. Wouldn't have them.

55
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,674
但我刚才是以他们的方式思考的
I am attuned, though, to the workings of what passes for their minds.

56
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,796
早上我们已经看到结果了
This morning we see the result:

57
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,589
更多的债权被抛售  价格更低了
more claims offered for sale and prices pressed downward.

58
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,392
拥有者害怕你把怒火倾泻在他们头上
You suppose the owners fear you might visit your ire on their titles?

59
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,672
-我想离开这里  -我理解
-I want to get out of here. -I understand.

60
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,756
你离开前会有点闲暇么？
Will you have a quick wind of your timepiece before you go?

61
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,751
没有  先生  我没功夫了
No. No, sir, I will not.

62
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,910
我感到脚下的土壤正在被水冲走
I feel the earth washing away from beneath me.

63
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,479
我想离开
I want to go away.

64
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,637
我们会想你的
We'll fucking miss you.

65
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,037
还有你  沃尔科特先生
And you, Mr Wolcott,

66
00:06:18,038 --> 00:06:20,114
我发现你是最让人失望的
I find you the most severe disappointment of all.

67
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,151
我对自己也经常如此
Often to myself as well.

68
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,752
我们预料他会给杨克顿带去什么样的印象呢？
What impressions do we expect he'll take to Yankton?

69
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,910
你的钱花在了那儿
That your money spends...

70
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,634
所以我会是个但杨克顿不认为是的危险分子
and I'm a dangerous man with whom to disagree.

71
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,288
你把我们组在一起
You put us together,

72
00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:39,556
不会让我们给赫斯特先生留下坏印象
don't that make us the very image of Mr Hearst...

73
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,234
因为他想让杨克顿考虑他
as he'd want Yankton to think of him?

74
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,277
你家的那个犹太人怎么样？
How's the Jew-fucking going?

75
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,234
还行
It's all right.

76
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,590
这个信息对我有什么帮助？
What does it add to my understanding?

77
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,148
今早他去见那个寡妇了
He's meeting with the widow this morning.

78
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,313
他和另一个人提到了建银行 这件事上也提到了她
Spoke to the other of forming a bank, and of her in that connection.

79
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,039
-你说的另一个人是谁？  -布洛克
-Who's the fucking "other"? -Fucking Bullock.

80
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,759
我的情感没那么娇气
My sensibilities do not need coddling, either.

81
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,036
与你无关
It's no concern for you.

82
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,915
我不想叫出那个混蛋的名字
I don't like naming the cocksucker.

83
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,235
不管怎样  那可能就是打算了
Anyways, that may be its purpose...

84
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,716
他和那个寡妇坐在一起
he‘s sitting down with the widow.

85
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,759
那个犹太人？
The Jew?

86
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,035
我希望你能为和他滚床单收点钱
I hope you're getting paid for the pussy.

87
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,192
你不定价就会失去他们的尊重
Don't put a price to it, you'll lose their respect.

88
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,119
他教我算账了
He's teaching me accounts.

89
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,838
那就没事了
That's all right then.

90
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,468
对他们来说学习就是货币了
Learning is like currency to them.

91
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:40,318
他和我做爱是看着我的眼睛  赤裸裸的渴望
He stares in my eyes when he fucks me, longing-like.

92
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,159
上帝啊
Jesus Christ.

93
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,791
你看起来不太糟
You don't look so bad.

94
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,549
Yeah  下一件事呈上来
Yeah, next thing to up and about.

95
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,799
夫人  我可以打扰一下么？
Ma'am, may l?

96
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,872
A・W・梅里克  夫人  黑山先锋报
A.W. Merrick, ma'am, of the Black Hills Pioneer...

97
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,030
冒昧的介绍下自己
making bold to introduce himself.

98
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,713
我是玛丽・斯托克斯  梅里克先生
I am Mary Stokes, Mr Merrick.

99
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,237
我想是的 果然如此  认识你很高兴  夫人
I thought so! I hoped so. I'm delighted to make your acquaintance, ma'am.

100
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,710
也替你要教的营地孩子们高兴
And for the camp's children, whom you will edify.

101
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,919
-这是你的么？ -是的
-ls this yours? -Yes.

102
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,560
还有你的包  你的包 我们看看是不是在上面
And your bags, your bags. Let's see, are they up here?

103
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,874
别说实话
Liar.

104
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,238
-崔克茜小姐  -怎么了？
-Miss Trixie. -What is this now?

105
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,709
没什么糟糕的事  我在找你
Nothing nefarious. I was looking for you.

106
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,592
我被震惊了
My nerves have had a shock.

107
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,951
-怎么了？ -盖勒特夫人情况不怎么好
-How so? -Mrs Garret took poorly.

108
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,031
在会见斯塔尔先生的时候？
At the meeting with Mr Star?

109
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,515
过来谈
Come here.

110
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,992
我补充点
I'll add that...

111
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,713
最近几周她都不怎么好
she hasn't looked well the last few weeks...

112
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,916
尤其早上  眼色苍白
especially in the morning. Pale.

113
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,072
你在暗示什么？
What are you fucking hinting at?

114
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,479
－什么也没有  －没事？
-Nothing. -Nothing?

115
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,473
她就早上脸色苍白  其他时间不这样么？
She ain't looked well mornings opposed to the rest of the day? Pale?

116
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:40,115
怎么我说出我的发现反而受指责了？
How does sharing observations make me liable to rebuke?

117
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,038
换句话说  你让她怀孕了
You got her knocked up, in other words.

118
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,471
我？ 我不会让她怀孕的  崔克茜
Me? I ain't got her in any way at all, Trixie.

119
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,269
在你看来  我在讲的  就是她怀孕了
In your opinion, I'm saying, she's in the way.

120
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,268
我受雇佣而为她工作
I work for the woman in her fucking employ.

121
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,794
我理解
I understand that.

122
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,997
那就是全部了
And that is the sole fucking full extent of it.

123
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,956
你想做对的事么？
Would you do the right thing?

124
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,077
此事与我无关啊
I was not involved.

125
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,357
我们跳过这个  我知道与你无关
We're fucking past that. I know you weren't fucking involved.

126
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,391
那与谁有关呢？
Who was involved, too...

127
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,636
就事态发展来看？
far as that fucking goes?

128
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,314
你愿意么？
Would you?

129
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,678
我愿意什么？
Would I fucking what?

130
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,436
在这个情形下干点对的事
Do the right fucking thing in that fucking situation?

131
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,434
什么情形？解释一下啊
What's the situation? Explain it.

132
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,916
如果她想要这个孩子
If she wanted the child...

133
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,846
一个女人是多么想要一个孩子
how a woman wants one

134
00:10:27,847 --> 00:10:29,834
而且不确定她能够忍受许多
that ain't certain she's made to bear many...

135
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,390
她甚至愿意忍受未婚生子
willing even to bear it out of wedlock...

136
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,075
承受伤害  承受屈辱
but for the hurt she'd do another and the humiliation she'd do...

137
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,343
还会对另一个女人的孩子造成这些影响
and to that other woman's little boy.

138
00:10:39,344 --> 00:10:40,753
那么你愿意吗？
Would you do it then?

139
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,229
愿意？
Do?

140
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,119
做正确的事  别惺惺作态
The right fucking thing. Don't get fucking coy with me.

141
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,516
你是说娶她？
Marry her, you're saying?

142
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,353
在他人看来孩子
And the child in the eyes of others...

143
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,877
就是我的了
the issue of my loins.

144
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,590
他们只关心表面
As much as they care to see.

145
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,630
这只会暂时的吸引大家的眼球
This is only a passing glance.

146
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,108
而精液又不是当着他们的面射出来
So the cum's true author ain't thrown in their fucking face.

147
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,407
或者是肇事者妻子的面
Or the true author's wife's face,

148
00:11:11,408 --> 00:11:14,275
又或者是当着那个小孩的面
or the face of that little fucking boy.

149
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,435
Well?
Well?

150
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,911
她愿意我娶她么？
Would she fucking have me?

151
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,196
我去解决这事
I'd work on that next.

152
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,510
-课本  -Oh  漂亮
-Books. -Ah, wonderful.

153
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,956
我在俾斯麦群岛把它们分装在几个箱子里了
I parted with several boxes in Bismarck.

154
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,112
我支持俾斯麦改革
I'm sure to Bismarck's betterment.

155
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,351
大部分缘由是为了孩子们
Mostly for the sake of the children.

156
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,113
那我猜其他的缘由
The other few, might I suspect...

157
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,998
就是因为你自己的某种儿时记忆了
for the sake of certain childhood memories of your own?

158
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,879
你可能是猜对了
You may, and be in the right.

159
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,277
斯托克斯夫人  你去住处的时候
When you're situated, Miss Stokes...

160
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,509
我可以陪你参观营地么？
may I take you on a tour of the camp?

161
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,638
那我就谢了
I would be grateful.

162
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,878
斯托克斯夫人  包在我身上了
no more than l, Miss Stokes, I assure you.

163
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,510
Oh  一个男的来到了营地  沃尔科特
Oh, a man's come to camp. Wolcott.

164
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,310
代理赫斯特的利益
Agent for the Hearst's interest.

165
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,396
我相信他和杨克顿还有托利维通过话
I believe he's made calls with Tolliver and Yankton.

166
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,869
那就是为什么杨克顿突然有胆量了
That's why Yankton's suddenly got balls.

167
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,917
我让他错以为我要骗他
I made him think I was trying to gull him...

168
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,468
但他反而逆转了
and that he had turned the tables on me.

169
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,876
他花了多少钱收买你？
How much did he buy you for?

170
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,798
你恢复中的时候我让丹上报了
I kept Dan apprised while you convalesced...

171
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,151
以简短的形式
in abbreviated fashion.

172
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,835
多少钱？
How much?

173
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,512
Oh  1万美金
Oh, $10,000.

174
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:35,355
他认为  招募我  来传播债权失效的谣言
Enlisting me, so he thought, to spread rumours about rescission of the claims.

175
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,590
托利维出头？
Tolliver's the front?

176
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,717
从恐慌的卖者手里买  被沃尔科特雇佣
Buying from the panicked sellers, engaged by this Wolcott.

177
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,996
代理乔治・赫斯特？
This agent for George Hearst?

178
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,751
简而言之就是如此
That's it in a nutshell.

179
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,395
AI  我没对你不忠
I meant you no disloyalty, Al.

180
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,435
你为自己打算以防我死了
You look out for yourself against the chance I'd die.

181
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,189
我绝对没希望是那个结果
I never wished for that outcome.

182
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,349
但我是天生的追随者
But I am a born follower.

183
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,398
无论如何  现在是我们在一起了
In any case, here we are...

184
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,356
如果战术上不利  那就要从力量上补回来了
if tactically disadvantaged, exactly as before in strength.

185
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,920
Oh  当然  谢谢接见  先生
Oh, sure. Thank you, sir.

186
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,630
-早上好  -早上好  索尔
-Morning. -Morning, Sol.

187
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,634
谢谢帮我开张
Thanks for opening.

188
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,154
你出去了
You were out.

189
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:55,712
是的  我出门拜访然后走了一会儿
Yes. Yes, I paid a call and then I've been walking.

190
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,558
拜访的是盖勒特夫人
The call was on Mrs Garret.

191
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,029
我们说好不这么干的
We agreed that wasn't gonna happen.

192
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,909
我们的协议是不请她投资银行
Our agreement was to not solicit her investment in a bank.

193
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,039
这次拜访是应她邀请的
The call I paid was at her invitation.

194
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,910
我不在乎谁邀请谁  索尔
I don't give a fuck who invited who, Sol.

195
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,069
那是你的立场
That's your position.

196
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,232
银行是会议的议题么？  出去
Was the bank the subject of the meeting? Get out!

197
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,389
请等我们一会儿
Excuse us a little while, please.

198
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,831
她邀请的我  塞斯
She invited me, Seth.

199
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,310
讨论成立银行  来这儿邀请你么？
To talk of forming a bank, came here and invited you?

200
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,038
派来了为她工作的埃尔斯沃斯
Sent Ellsworth that works for her.

201
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,997
你没告诉我这事
You told me none of it.

202
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,674
怕你表现得不理智
Suspecting maybe you mightn't act rational.

203
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,591
但我肯定你告诉那个妓女了
But I bet you told the whore.

204
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,990
这事我们现在谈完了
We're done talking about this for now.

205
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,355
-没有  -谈完了  塞斯
-No! -Yes, Seth.

206
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,998
我们已经谈完这事了
We're done talking about this.

207
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,638
如果你坚持  咱俩就得打架了
If you keep it up, we're going to fight...

208
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,029
然后我调养期间你就得自己工作了
and you'll have to work by yourself while I convalesce.

209
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,992
斯维尔根先生  我被艾尔玛・盖勒特雇佣到深夜
Until late, Mr Swearengen, I was employed by Alma Garret...

210
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,832
作为她监护的孤儿的教师
as tutor to her orphan ward.

211
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,992
-两天前被解雇  -让她说
-Sacked two days ago. -Let her tell it.

212
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,028
在我被雇佣期间
In the course of my employment...

213
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,112
我经常看到盖勒特夫人处于鸦片的影响下
I frequently saw Mrs Garret under the influence of opiates.

214
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,633
在此状态  她对我承认
In this state, she admitted to me...

215
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,790
她委托别人做得她丈夫的谋杀案
having commissioned the murder of her husband.

216
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,313
多么荒唐的世界啊
What a world.

217
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,191
她说你是她的行凶者
She named you as her instrument.

218
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,395
说我杀了他？
Said I killed him?

219
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,994
她没详细说你真得杀了他
She never specified you'd actually killed him.

220
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,116
-说得很模糊  -不错
-Left it vague-like. -Exactly.

221
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,112
-我是行凶者？ -是的
-That I was her instrument? -Yes.

222
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,816
那我们就能说成是别人
So we could pin it on someone else,

223
00:15:27,817 --> 00:15:30,079
否则我就得代人受罪 供认
or I could take the fall, confess...

224
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,435
-支持你的说法  -是的
-supporting your version -Yes.

225
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,432
写下来  然后逃跑
In writing and then subsequently escape.

226
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,638
这是已知中将会发生的
Such has been known to occur.

227
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,519
留下寡妇一个人在牢房里
Leaving the widow lonely at the bar of justice.

228
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,511
总比一个都没有强
Better one than none at all.

229
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,998
-你为谁卖命？  -卑鄙的人
-Who do you work for? -People of means.

230
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,119
你为之工作的人是被卑鄙的人雇佣的
People you work for were hired by people of means.

231
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,510
不用小心翼翼地  伊斯林豪瑟小姐
Don't get cagey, Miss lsringhausen.

232
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,075
我提醒下  斯维尔根先生
Let me suggest, Mr Swearengen...

233
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,594
你还没偏离自己的机会
you do not get distracted from your opportunity.

234
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,672
你不应考虑我为谁工作  而是你要付多少钱
Not who I work for should concern you, but the amount you'll be paid...

235
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,352
以及接款人的担保
and the surety of its delivery.

236
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,509
太他妈对了
Too fucking true.

237
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,275
为什么我真想祈祷不是平克顿呢  他们收买了你
Why, I pray fervently it ain't the Pinkertons whose pay you're in...

238
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,791
她丈夫的家人雇佣了他们来偷她的金子
and that her dead husband's people hired to steal her gold.

239
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,072
我没缘由的讨厌那些混蛋
I got unrelated reasons to hate those cocksuckers.

240
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,628
5万美元
$50,000.

241
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,109
我想不出来其他可能的人会是谁
I'm hard-pressed to think who the fuck else it would be.

242
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,509
5万美元  斯维尔根先生
$50,000, Mr Swearengen.

243
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,070
从你付给你下属的钱里出
Separate from pay to your subordinates.

244
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,897
从你的口袋 不是我的[说给塞拉斯的]
Your pockets, not mine?

245
00:16:27,898 --> 00:16:28,355
是的
Yes.

246
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,479
需要为他和你做爱付钱么？
Would it go against his for the pussy?

247
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,513
不必为滚床单付款
No charge for the pussy.

248
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,872
-介意我考虑一天么？ -不介意
-Mind if I take the day? -Not at all.

249
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,470
眼下我还有很多事要做
I've got a lot on my plate just now...

250
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,677
并且我感觉还没到让我筋疲力尽的程度
and I'm feeling less than my full fucking self.

251
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,910
你让我感到害怕
You seem quite formidable to me.

252
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,950
不管怎样我等着从塞拉斯那儿听信儿
In any case, I'll wait to hear from Silas.

253
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,715
成交
Do.

254
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,233
这是很大一笔钱啊
That'd be grand.

255
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,193
我感觉我要是骂你妓女  我感觉你都不会晕倒
I guess if I called you a cunt, I needn't expect you to faint?

256
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,430
-是的  -乍一听到会有点受打击么？
-No. -Getting struck be a first?

257
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,238
我怎么损害你的利益了？
How have I injured your interests?

258
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,959
做梦他在楼上正考虑给我升职？
Think he's upstairs considering me for promotion?

259
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,434
无论如何  离开我的房间
Anyway, clear out of my room.

260
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,996
过来干我吧  为什么不呢？
Come up and fuck me, why don't you?

261
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,518
这么简单？  我害怕被蛇咬
Simple as that? I'd fear a snakebite.

262
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,918
上来干我  我会回答你问的每一个问题
Come up and fuck me, and I'll answer every one you want to ask.

263
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,149
早上好  治安官
Morning, Sheriff.

264
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,038
你足够冷静地听我说话了么？
You sober enough to listen?

265
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,110
你想羞辱我？
Did you just intend to insult me?

266
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,959
-抱歉  治安官 -我知道
-Excuse me, Sheriff. -I know.

267
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,076
你面子被撅了
You face business reverses.

268
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,390
就好像正在失去的债权
Like losing my fucking claim.

269
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,235
为困难生气的人往往表现得像个白痴
People angry at their difficulties often act like fucking idiots...

270
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,949
但是也不能谋杀这个营地的任何肤色的人
but there'll be no murdering people in this camp of any colour...

271
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,349
或者袭击任何类别的政府官员
or assaults on officials of any stripe.

272
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,989
即使杨克顿那些和上帝勾结的贼都知道阴谁？
Even Yankton thieves who are in league with God knows fucking who?

273
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,755
官员来自于杨克顿或者其他方面  是或不是贼
Officials from Yankton or otherwise, or thieves or not.

274
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:45,589
如果你受不了就离开这个营地
If you can't live with that, get out of this fucking camp.

275
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,310
我能受得了  但你就得给我收拾烂摊子了
I can live with it. You have to keep rubbing my fucking nose in it?

276
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,959
不要再在营地撒野
Do not misconduct yourself again in this camp.

277
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,309
他必须得按治安官说得做么？
Must he take what the Sheriff just fucking give him?

278
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,072
明显是啊
Apparently so.

279
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,950
他没必要的  这儿没有惯例  没有法律
He needn't. Not by custom, not by fucking law.

280
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,192
给我指条道吧
Name my remedy then.

281
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:16,755
地上每个政府所在之外都有照顾不到的地方
Outside every county courthouse in the land is the lady blindfolded.

282
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,312
不错  目前来讲的确如此
True, far as it goes.

283
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,273
别拿他们当回事就能平衡了
To ignore how them scales she carries sometimes gets balanced out.

284
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,152
在政府里  我没有地位
There, I take no position.

285
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,310
我可以弄个皮头
I could take a leather punch...

286
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,676
捅进那个混蛋的马屁股
and stab the bastard's horse in the fucking ass.

287
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,354
你可以的  那就对了
You could, and you'd be in the right.

288
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,797
在它身上刻上写上：布洛克  我干了你的马
Carve on its coat: "Bullock, I fucked your horse..."

289
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,429
咱们的帐抵消了
and square the fucking scales.

290
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,518
如果摘下眼罩  看到那个女士在眨眼
And if the blindfold was down, see the lady a-winking...

291
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,478
然后她告诉你  你干的真像个男人
while she told you, you done it like a man.

292
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,399
如果我刻上‘干’  那么我会
And if I carve "fuck," I will...

293
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,473
去对着唱诗班说吧
Preaching to the choir.

294
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,069
-多谢  -没事
-Thanks. -Sure.

295
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,237
可能会沾上点屎的
Mingle the shit somewhat.

296
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,832
你应该少说两句
You ought to take up whittling.

297
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,718
船长  准备收钱吧  交换所有权
Ready to receive currency, Captain, in exchange for titles.

298
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,949
好的
Yes.

299
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:30,318
因为我做的维持演说  所以记功时…
And as I've learned to sustain discourse while counting...

300
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,439
我想和你商量一下
I'm gonna ask you to take counsel with me.

301
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,873
关于什么？
In what regard?

302
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,316
首先  我们要达成一致  中国妓女卖相不好
Well, first, let's agree them Chink whores make a poor appearance.

303
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,469
是的
Yes.

304
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:44,031
就她们关押的地方而言  她们不吸引人
And as far as locales for fucking them cribs they're in lack allure.

305
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,996
她们可以吸引有意的客户
They might attract the intended clientele.

306
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,352
现在  有个想法我想让我们商量一下的
Now, that's an attitude right there I want us to counsel on.

307
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,830
自作聪明的那种想法
Smart-alecky sort of attitude...

308
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:57,710
可能会有点气人
and almost with a quality of fucking anger to it.

309
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,758
我找不到一个准确的词来描述
I don't find exact fucking words for it...

310
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,434
但是它让我烦扰、担心
but it fucking disturbs and concerns me.

311
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,715
在我看来  我感觉我安排的挺好
By my lights, I feel I manage well.

312
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,077
Well  沃尔科特先生  你当然可以那么说
Well, you can say that, Mr Wolcott...

313
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,516
然而我听到的描述是
yet I hear accounts...

314
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,918
你是个危险的嫖客
that you're a dangerous lay...

315
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,159
这加深了我的烦扰
and that adds to my feeling disturbed.

316
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,994
你有点偏心  先生 偶尔
Are you inclined, sir, every so often...

317
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,191
要把人挤下悬崖
to ride one off the cliff?

318
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,274
姑娘们  我是说？
Girls, I mean?

319
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,199
我的私人生活被提及让我很是不安
I am disturbed at my private conduct being spoken of.

320
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,350
Well   我应该想到你会如此的
Well, I should think you fucking would be.

321
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,158
应该先考虑赫斯特先生的不安
And to think of Mr Hearst's disturbance

322
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:34,836
如果赫斯特先生知道的话
if he was to fucking know.

323
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,148
因为
Because...

324
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,549
当你不在朋友之间时  放纵是个危险的习惯
that's a dangerous habit to indulge when you're not among friends.

325
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,037
你是我的朋友么  托利维先生？
Are you my friend, Mr Tolliver?

326
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:50,989
有些人经过对于习惯 偏袒 形势变化的惊讶
And someone past surprise at habits or inclination, or turns of events...

327
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,232
就不会困扰自己了  直到和基督
and who don't confuse himself far as sitting in judgement...

328
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,197
一起坐在天堂评判他人
with our Lord in fucking Heaven.

329
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,799
-我明白  -那么
-I see.  -And...

330
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,634
不会泄露给你的老板的人也不会
who would never tattle to your employer...

331
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,916
危及自己快要到手的可观的收入
or jeopardise what's got to be a handsome fucking income.

332
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,039
他妈的 对了  我是你的朋友  沃尔科特先生
Goddamn right, I am your friend, Mr Wolcott.

333
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,998
我唯一不能提供会给这次联合的就是绝路
All I can't provide for the party is the cliff.

334
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,199
你要相信刚发生的惊讶是不会让你变成我的朋友的
Believing yourself past surprise does not commend you to me as a friend.

335
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,514
一个不够世故
A man inadequately sophisticated...

336
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,836
并且有点愚昧  还有点愚蠢的男人
or merely ignorant, or simply stupid...

337
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,311
可能会相信这个惊讶结束了
may believe himself past surprise...

338
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,073
然后会惊讶的发现  比如
then be surprised to discover, for example...

339
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,589
赫斯特先生已经知道并且意识到了我的偏心
that Mr Hearst already knows of my inclinations and finds them immaterial.

340
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,115
我的建议  作为结论  你敲诈和操纵的技巧
Suggesting, as a corollary, that your skills for blackmail and manipulation...

341
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,077
不再是你拥有的财富了
no longer are assets to you...

342
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:47,758
对于你那愚蠢的准则  在使用的效果上
and for your fatuous belief in their efficacy...

343
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,471
事实上  已经变成了债务
in fact, have become liabilities.

344
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,956
简而言之  你手伸过界了
In short, you've overplayed your hand.

345
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,631
现在  我因此认为
Now, I should think in consequence...

346
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,957
察觉了你是一个在最后的过渡时期
now recognising yourself as a man past his time...

347
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,075
错过了自己时机的人
that during this last transitional period...

348
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,796
你最好感激、勤勉的奉献自己
you would devote yourself with grateful and quiet diligence...

349
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,279
到这些用处上  因为有人发现你仍然适合干这些事
to such uses as others may still find you suitable.

350
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,397
你赌我会感激涕零  一个像你这样的人
Oh, you bet I'm grateful. A man like yourself...

351
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,714
靠在赫斯特先生怀里
warmed at Mr Hearst's bosom...

352
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,598
用他的信任获得保障
secure in his confidence and trust...

353
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,514
花着时间和精力来说服像我这么顽固的人
taking the time and spending the energy to persuade a relic like me.

354
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,470
她在芝加哥 波士顿 纽约登广告找家教
She'd placed adverts for a tutor in Chicago, Boston and New York.

355
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,751
薪酬驱使我来看看
The interests that employ me saw.

356
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,316
-那时你在做什么？  -开汽船
-What was you doing at the time? -Piloting a steamboat.

357
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,148
对于雇你阴她的人 AI说得对么？
Was Al right who hired you people to fuck her up?

358
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,912
我也没被告知
That's not something I'm told.

359
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,558
肯定是她死去的丈夫的家人
Must be the dead husband's parents...

360
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,756
如果他们想吊死她的话
if they want to hang that murder off her neck.

361
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,353
有可能
That would make sense.

362
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,396
为什么斯维尔根讨厌平克顿呢？
Why does Swearengen hate the Pinkertons?

363
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,632
不知道  一个那么顽强的组织
Beats me, a stalwart organisation like that.

364
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:08,036
在宾夕法尼亚你帮助运送矿工  让他们送死么？
Did you help send them miners up the fucking scaffold in Pennsylvania?

365
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,151
我在密西西比州工作
I was busy on the Mississip'.

366
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,508
没有希望
Past hope.

367
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,557
没有善良和关心
Past kindness or consideration.

368
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,753
没有正义
Past justice.

369
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,038
没有满足
Past satisfaction.

370
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,589
没有冷暖舒适
Past warmth or cold or comfort.

371
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,879
没有爱
Past love.

372
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,279
也没有惊喜
But past surprise?

373
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,633
会变成一个无尽的多么无趣的人生啊
What an endlessly unfolding tedium life would then become.

374
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,673
不  多丽丝
No, Doris...

375
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,519
我们必须让你经历惊讶
we must not let you be past surprise.

376
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,116
凯莉打盹呢  我去叫醒她
Carrie's napping. I'll awaken her.

377
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,351
不必了  我现在想要这个年轻的姑娘陪我
You needn't. I'd like to see this young lady just now.

378
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,633
好的  多丽丝？
All right. Doris?

379
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,153
Ah  老师在我的记忆力
Ah, teachers one remembers.

380
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,239
总是那么善良
The thrilling kindness of the extra moment taken...

381
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,550
总是那么的鼓舞人心
the extra word of encouragement offered.

382
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:40,435
可能会这样 “你  小伙子”或者“小姑娘”
"You, young man," or "woman" as the case might have been...

383
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,518
有着令人瞩目的才情
"have an interesting turn of mind."

384
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,030
是的  来回来去总是那些情形
Yes. And to take that extra moment in turn.

385
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:52,399
Oh 斯托克斯夫人  一句话改变人的一生的
Oh, Miss Stokes, to alter a life's course with a word...

386
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,477
我是多么的尊敬您啊
how I revere you...

387
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,758
还有你的专业水准
your profession.

388
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,482
Well  谢谢  梅利克先生
Well, thank you, Mr Merrick.

389
00:25:59,483 --> 00:26:00,959
不  应该谢谢你  斯托克斯夫人
No, thank you, Miss Stokes.

390
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,190
以及所有如你这般的老师
And all teachers in you.

391
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,948
在你前面的是布洛克的房子
There before you is the Bullock house.

392
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,750
它是最近由布洛克先生建的
It was recently constructed by Mr Bullock.

393
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,511
这些街道啊
These streets.

394
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,878
我要见他  吴
I got to meet him, Wu.

395
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,952
混蛋
Cocksucker!

396
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,237
旧金山混蛋
San Francisco cocksucker.

397
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,635
我要见他
I have got to meet him.

398
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,479
斯维尔根  旧金山混蛋
Swearengen, San Francisco cocksucker meet!

399
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,870
旧金山混蛋和斯维尔根要见面
San Francisco cocksucker and Swearengen got to meet.

400
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:34,192
吴 我要见他  我看看他有多少料
I've got to meet him, Wu. I've got to see how much juice he's got.

401
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,994
犹太人？
Jews?

402
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:41,512
Yeah  我要见他 探探旧金山混蛋的底细
Yeah, I've got to see how much juice San Francisco cocksucker's got.

403
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,031
犹太人？犹太人？
Jew? Jew?

404
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:53,590
-不 吴 不是犹太人  -犹太人？
-No. No, Wu. No Jews. -Jew?

405
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,113
不是犹太人  忘了这个词吧
No Jew. Forget juice.

406
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,474
-忘了它  -不是犹太人？
-Forget juice. -No Jew?

407
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,549
忘了这个词
Forget juice.

408
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,552
不是  斯维尔根  不是旧金山混蛋  也不是犹太人
No, Swearengen. No San Francisco cocksucker. No Jew.

409
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,719
斯维尔根和吴
Swearengen, Wu.

410
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,594
吴和斯维尔根
Wu and Swearengen.

411
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,112
其他的姑娘在哪？
Where are the other girls?

412
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,236
在店里闲逛  怎么了？
Mooning over a dress at that store. What is it?

413
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,952
他和多丽丝在房间里
He's in a room with Doris.

414
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,634
沃尔科特
Wolcott.

415
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,548
-为什么和多丽丝在一起？  -我不知道
-Why is he with Doris? -I don't know.

416
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,314
-Well 为什么不是凯莉？ -凯莉在打盹
-Well, why ain't he with Carrie? -Carrie's napping.

417
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,473
我无法想象
I can't imagine...

418
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,431
关于多丽丝  凯莉告诉沃尔科特什么了
what Carrie might have told Wolcott about Doris...

419
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,590
才让他想干她
to make him want to fuck her.

420
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,954
也许是她报告给赛・托利维了
Maybe that she reports to Cy Tolliver?

421
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,993
好让沃尔科特别把她当球往墙上扔
To keep Wolcott from bouncing Doris off more walls?

422
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,396
从你的杂志上抬头吧  麦蒂
Look up from your fucking magazine, Maddie.

423
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,958
我现在要凯莉
I would like to see Carrie now.

424
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,958
帮我想想  绅士们
Assist me in a flight of fancy, gentlemen.

425
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,790
Well T先生 不要让我想象里昂穿裙子的情景
Well, don't make me think of Leon in a dress, Mr T.

426
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,355
或者我代替他做除了穿衣服
Or me of him anything but fully clothed.

427
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,159
想像梅里克出现在你们面前
Mr Merrick appears before you.

428
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:28,196
他说  有人砸了我的报社
"Somebody's fucked with my newspaper office," he says.

429
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,392
我的印刷设备一片狼藉
"My presses are a mess.

430
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,438
‘我的字母盘打翻了’诸如此类的情形
"My vowel trays are overturned," or the like.

431
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,915
-你们怎么回答？  -滚蛋
-How do you respond? -Go fuck yourself.

432
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,194
我们不知道这事儿
We don't know anything about it.

433
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,093
如果你当时不在那儿被打了或被杀了
If you ain't here to fuck or be fleeced,

434
00:28:39,094 --> 00:28:40,113
就该谢天谢地了
get on your merry way.

435
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,350
不错  这样怎么样
Good. Now, how about:

436
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,955
在拳击赛中裁判是中立的  梅里克
"Referee's the only neutral in a prize fight, Merrick...

437
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,712
可惜你不是裁判
"and you ain't one of those."

438
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,393
我们可以那么说
We could say that.

439
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,513
我们在说什么？
What would we mean?

440
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:01,473
我不知道  伙计们  我什么都不知道
I don't know, fellas. I do not fucking know.

441
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,910
Well  你要是不知道  那我们也不知道
Well, if you don't, we don't have to, either.

442
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,438
我在说 在我看来
I am saying, far as I'm concerned...

443
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,432
你们的主动性和主导的能力
your initiative and leadership abilities...

444
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:13,796
持之以恒的就是不断地问问题
and stick-fucking-to-it-iveness are all in fucking question.

445
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,273
如果我是你们或者其中之一
And was I either or both of you...

446
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,471
我会认为这是个考验
I'd consider this a fucking test.

447
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,798
你感觉他什么时候会露面
When do you suppose he'll show up?

448
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,633
里昂  一旦我们造访了他的地盘之后
Once we've paid a visit to his place, Leon.

449
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,989
Oh
Oh.

450
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,078
以及后果  当梅里克碰上我们
And aftermath, when Merrick's path crosses ours...

451
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,990
他会听到‘中立’和‘拳击赛’
he'll hear of the "neutral" and the "prize fight."

452
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,230
毋庸置疑
In no uncertain terms.

453
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,119
知道了预言的出处
And know the import of that fucking parable.

454
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,873
那么好吧
All right then.

455
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,753
用锤子？
Got any sledgehammers?

456
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,989
必须的
Always.

457
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,190
-我要进去  -不 你不能
-I'm going in there. -No, you aren't.

458
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,357
他不是那种喜欢双飞的人
He ain't the type to be with two women.

459
00:29:59,358 --> 00:30:01,115
我没研究过他的历史
I never took his full history.

460
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,554
我是说他不是
I'm saying he ain't.

461
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,269
凯莉 我们要在这做什么呢？
What are we to do here, Carrie?

462
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,199
除掉她
Get rid of her.

463
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,119
他们会妨害你
They'll let you.

464
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:21,519
我猜是的  但是并不能解决问题
I suppose they will, but that won't dispose of the problem.

465
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,719
问题是什么？
What's the problem?

466
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,879
我不知道
I don't know.

467
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,034
我不能说
I can't say.

468
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,316
我不想让你看到我
I don't want you to have seen me.

469
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,915
我不在乎你杀了她  她肯定对你做了什么
I don't care you killed her. She must have done something to you.

470
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,752
我是说事情不一样了
I mean something different.

471
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,471
我不想被看到
I don't want to have been seen.

472
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,836
你他妈疯了
Then you're fucking crazy.

473
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,600
你要在这个鬼地方杀了我
And you're going to kill me in this fucking shithole.

474
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,591
你知道怎样能让它无害么？
Do you know how to make it not hurt?

475
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,718
现在我可以断臂保军了
Now, I could cut off my arm.

476
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,028
我要进去
I'm going in.

477
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,998
你的枪不在那儿
Your gun isn't there.

478
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,314
我拿了
I've got it.

479
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,234
继续走  出去
Go on, get out!

480
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,629
斯塔布斯小姐
Miss Stubbs.

481
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,188
乌特先生
Mr Utter.

482
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,511
你做了什么  W先生
What did you do, Mr W?

483
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:19,597
昂贵的事儿
Something very expensive.

484
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,231
10万美元
$100,000.

485
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,828
现在
For now.

486
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,877
我想用它度过我活着的时间
And more when I want it for as many years as I live.

487
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,635
度过余生[这句话没翻译好]
For all the years of my life.

488
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,958
你明白么？
Do you understand?

489
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,429
我的地方有麻烦了 塞
There's trouble at my place, Cy.

490
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,829
当需要的的时候治安官布洛克又在哪呢？
Where is Sheriff Bullock when he's needed?

491
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:14,109
她最后向你汇报了  多丽丝提到被打了么？
Her last report to you, did Doris speak of getting beat on?

492
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:18,479
-搞出的麻烦是哪个人啊 -别跟着我
-That's the man making the trouble. -Don't you fucking follow me.

493
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,870
杰克  你有多少钱？
How much money you got, Jack?

494
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,913
别让我为难  乔安妮
Don't put me in the fucking middle, Joanie.

495
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,513
是的  我不会让你为难的
No, I wouldn't.

496
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,318
1400美元
$1,400.

497
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,138
莱拉  你能去找下乌特先生么
Can you run to Mr Utter, Lila,

498
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:34,352
让他准备一辆马车
tell him to ready a wagon.

499
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,873
好的  乔安妮
Sure, Joanie.

500
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,152
去拿钱  杰克
Go get your fucking money, Jack.

501
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,389
再拿一袋
Again.

502
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:03,750
给他打开袋子 确认这是黄金
Open the fucking bag for him, verify it's fucking gold.

503
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,436
我知道但我不想要
I know. I don't want it.

504
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,916
不管怎样  见到你很高兴
Anyways, good meeting you.

505
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,632
出来吧  吴
Come on out, Wu.

506
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,834
底细？
Juice?

507
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:34,749
如果2万元都不能引他反水  那么你对了
If $20,000 don't tempt him to converse, you're fucking-a-right.

508
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,115
也许你和我应该一起对付他
Maybe you and me should be working for him.

509
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,833
吴  斯维尔根
Wu, Swearengen.

510
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,392
好的  吴  难熬的一天啊
All right, Wu, it's been a long fucking day.

511
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,349
-没有旧金山的混蛋  -拜托  吴  AI累了
-No San Francisco cocksucker. -Come on, Wu, Al's tired.

512
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,069
-赫斯特  -他是个怎么样的人呢
-Hearst. -What about him?

513
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,439
旧金山
San Francisco.

514
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,916
你认为赫斯特和中国佬联合了？
You think Hearst and the Chink's connected?

515
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:12,235
你以为他生来就能不屑2万美金么
You think he was born looking down his nose at $20,000?

516
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:28,278
主要事实是  没有存活的目击者
Chief fact is, no witnesses are extant.

517
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:33,711
我出来的时候另一个女的在这  乔安妮・斯塔布斯
The other madam was here once when I came out, Joanie Stubbs.

518
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,358
-在你杀人之前？  -是的
-Before you did this? -Yes.

519
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,108
当我最后出来的时候  她跑了
When I came back out, she was gone.

520
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,189
-她不在卧室么？  -不在
-Was she ever in the bedroom? -No.

521
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,713
别关心那个女的了
Don't worry about the other madam.

522
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:01,270
回旅店  吃点东西  如果你还能吃得下话
Go to the hotel. Eat, if you can stand the food.

523
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,630
这里会被处理好的
This will all be took care of.

524
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:09,751
沃尔科特先生  我告诉过你 我不会坑队友
I told you, Mr Wolcott, all's I can't provide is the cliff.

525
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,790
走吧  离开这
Go on now, get out of here.

526
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,832
对于我提及崔克茜并辱骂了她 我表示抱歉
I apologise for bringing Trixie into it, and calling her what I did.

527
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,514
这话我听过
That wasn't new information to me.

528
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,713
在咱俩谈过之后  我出去找傻逼史蒂夫了
After you and me talked, I searched that idiot Steve out...

529
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,349
骂了他 还打了那个傻逼的脸
to rebuke him and smack him in the face for being who he was.

530
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,388
治安官
Sheriff.

531
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,110
告诉我有关你和盖勒特夫人会面的事
Tell me about your meeting with Mrs Garret.

532
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,670
她一次都没提你的名字
She never once mentioned your name.

533
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,392
她想成立银行以便将营地变得更好
She wants to form the bank to better the camp.

534
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,070
-邀请你了加入了？  -我当执行官
-And asked you to be involved? -To serve as chief officer.

535
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,434
你会很称职的
You'd be a good one.

536
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,077
我感觉她可能有孩子了
I got the impression that she might be with child.

537
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,550
洛特在任何情况下也不会做出那样的饭的
Lot, before God, could make no case for that food.

538
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,631
可能是洛特的妻子做的饭
Lot's wife may have been in that food.

539
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,551
盐放多了
Over salted as it was.

540
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,355
我就这么理解你的意思了
I took that to be your meaning.

541
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,919
我擦
Shit.

542
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,796
别动  该死的
Stay still, God damn it.

543
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,954
在我干你的腿的时候
While I come on your fucking leg.

544
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,229
你很幸运我没干你
You're lucky I'm not fucking you.

545
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,359
你要告诉治安官
You tell the Sheriff how that fucking felt...

546
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,670
我干你的腿的时候你感觉如何
me coming on your fucking leg.

547
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:27,508
以及我把你从被干屁股救了出来
Or that I saved you from an ass fucking.

548
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:33,028
在学校你学了什么  他们就教了你这个？
What else did you learn at that school that teached you that?

549
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,470
托利维先生  我的办公室被砸了
Mr Tolliver, my office has been torn apart.

550
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,714
-运气不好啊  -我的出版社被砸坏了
-Hard luck. -My press has been damaged...

551
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,076
我的字母盘无法修复了  还有刚到的教师…
my vowel tray beyond repair. And the newly-arrived schoolteacher...

552
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,596
斯托克斯夫人  被吓得跑回了她的旅馆房间
Miss Stokes, has been badly frightened and has retreated to her hotel.

553
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,553
我们归罪于捣乱分子么？
Do we blame unsavoury elements?

554
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:53,189
我将此事件作为
I regard this incident as postscript...

555
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,396
特派员访问的增刊
to the visit by County Commissioner Jarry.

556
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,629
有意思
Interesting.

557
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:00,190
报复我拒绝将杨克顿的债券所有权
Retribution for my refusal to associate my newspaper...

558
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:03,829
的通知印在报纸上
with Yankton's notice on title to the claims.

559
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,634
你是说在墙上订个通知？
For pinning the notice, you mean, on a wall...

560
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,995
而不是印在报头？
instead of printing it under your masthead?

561
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,150
那就是我的意思
That is my meaning exactly.

562
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,308
朽木先锋报和我干的事无关
Disassociating the Deadwood Pioneer from what I took to be...

563
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,391
与宣告的事正好相反
the opposite of an effort to inform.

564
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:21,189
也许你要是做好了你的份内  这潭水会平静点
Maybe if you had done your part, calmed the fucking waters a little...

565
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,032
就不会逼着特派员跑
instead of treeing the county commissioner...

566
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,759
民众也会稳当地离开  该干嘛干嘛
the hooples would have gone and got their loads on...

567
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,478
然后等着你的下一期报纸
and been waiting for your next edition.

568
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:30,094
不  我们见解不同  托利维先生
No, we differ, Mr Tolliver,

569
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:31,678
对于出版社的作用
on the function of the press.

570
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,718
梅里克  对于你 这不是个教训么？
Ain't the lesson for you in this, Merrick...

571
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,429
被砸坏的机器  报社一点都不能工作了
that with fucked up machinery, the press cannot function at all?

572
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,318
先生 这就是你破坏他人财物的目的？
And is that the vandalism's purpose, sir?

573
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:46,273
找条狗在我办公室撒野？
And of the dog defecating in my office...

574
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:51,196
通过你派遣的暴徒来给我教训？
with ruffians dispatched by you as the lesson's author?

575
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,469
对他们是否带狗我表示怀疑
I doubt they had a dog with them.

576
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,715
霍斯泰特勒  你在搞什么？
Hostetler, what the hell are you doing?

577
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,234
-他在这干马  -我没干马
-He was in here fucking a horse. -I did not fuck that horse.

578
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,758
我在问你在干什么？
I'm asking you what you're doing.

579
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,314
我要去拿个修蹄工具
I'm gonna go get a shoeing tool...

580
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,039
然后我要在这儿打死这个混蛋
and I'm gonna hit this bastard right here...

581
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,594
最后像片牛肉一样扔了他
and I'm gonna drop him like a piece of beef.

582
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,796
我没伤害过你
I never fucking harmed you.

583
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,071
我猜他不是在对我说
Guess he ain't talking to me.

584
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:28,197
我没像他捆着要杀我这样杀你
I didn't kill you like he's fixing to kill me.

585
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,035
你要死了  史蒂夫
You need to die, Steve.

586
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,390
你是这么干你也会付出代价
Hard as you worked, as much shit as you had to eat...

587
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,030
杀了他有意义么
only way it makes any sense to kill him...

588
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,708
如果你要写点东西  你得先听明白我说的
is if you sign everything you got across to me first.

589
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,358
因为我能看到合理性
'Cause then I could see the logic.

590
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,671
我要杀了他  然后我再回来杀了你
I'm gonna kill him, then I'm fucking gonna come back and kill you.

591
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,671
这不是我的想法
And this isn't my will.

592
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,310
你相信上帝会通过一个黑人来显灵么
Do you believe that God can act through a nigger?

593
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,630
上帝不想你被杀
God does not want you to kill.

594
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:58,271
你相信上帝会让我宽恕你么
Do you believe that God would let me feel mercy toward you...

595
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:01,511
你给我涂沥青  还干了他的马
that tarred me and fucked his horse?

596
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,909
我信  但我没干马
I do. But I did not fuck the horse.

597
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,672
你会满怀感激的走出去么？
Would you go hence in gratitude...

598
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,355
如果你在这个马厩得到宽恕
if you received mercy in this stable?

599
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,794
我会的
I would.

600
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,433
写下
Write out...

601
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,871
’我干了治安官的马‘  我们让他签字
"l fucked the Sheriff's horse." Then we gonna have him sign it.

602
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,236
-我没干马 -‘我干了’
-I didn't fuck the horse. -"l fucked--"

603
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,351
我自慰的  我在它的腿上
I jerked off. I came on his leg.

604
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,829
你会在这个有点夸大的记录上签字
Would you sign off on that slight exaggeration...

605
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:27,036
好保住你的脑袋不会被打碎么？
to keep from getting your fucking head smashed in?

606
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,235
是的
Yes.

607
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,800
你会为有色人种祝福
Would you bless coloured folk 

608
00:42:29,801 --> 00:42:32,598
承认上帝是我们所有人的圣父么？
and God that's father to us all?

609
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,188
我会的  然后满怀感激的走出去
I would and go hence in gratitude.

610
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:07,400
-现在走吧  史蒂夫  -走吧
-Go hence now, Steve, go on. -Now go.

611
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:11,474
如果你的感激消退了 就想想我们有你的签名
And if your gratitude ebbs, remember, we got your signature.

612
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,670
我要走了  我会记住的
I'll go, and I'll remember.

613
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,868
我喝了点酒就睡着了
I took a drink of liquor and it put me to sleep.

614
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,679
他怎么进来的  我都不知道
How he got in, how I got beside myself....

615
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,797
我有17年
I ain't took a drink...

616
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,519
没喝酒了
in 1 7 years.

617
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,191
Yeah Well  你解决这事了
Yeah, well, you're over that now.

618
00:43:35,192 --> 00:43:36,112
我再也不喝了
I don't want any.

619
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,874
那个假小子给你的消息？
That tomboy get you that message?

620
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,078
我欠你的  当他们像以前那样来找你的时候
I owe you. When they come for you like they did before...

621
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,078
你本可以像我做的那样做的
you would have did like I did.

622
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:49,597
就是快了点 没来得及
Only quicker.

623
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:53,829
-我很感谢那个消息 
-I appreciated the message. -So be it henceforth.

624
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,436
今天过的不好么？
Was it a difficult day?

625
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:02,669
不
No.

626
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:07,029
妈妈见了新的教师  并且很喜欢她
Mamma met the new schoolteacher and very much liked her.

627
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,875
梅里克先生领来的
Mr Merrick brought her to call.

628
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,473
好的
Good.

629
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:18,716
我很喜欢她  我很高兴她最后到了
I liked her very much. I'm delighted she's finally arrived.

630
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,199
不错
Good.

631
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,914
我精力不足
I lack my accustomed stamina.

632
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,869
妈逼的 医生  他们一波一波的来拜见AI
Bullshit, Doc. They've been coming at Al in waves...

633
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:37,313
他坚持到他们所有人离开
and he stood them all the fuck off.

634
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,356
他已经让谢尔曼人汗颜了
He'd have stopped Sherman shy of the sea.

635
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,352
没用腿  会成为他们关注的借口么？
Without the use of a leg, would they have fired me from a fucking cannon?

636
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:45,079
Well  我发现你情绪不错
Well, I find you in excellent fettle.

637
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,715
相对于我之前的惨样？
Relative to my former wreckage?

638
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:52,271
相对而言  是的 Ai的情形是相对的
Relatively speaking, yes. All conditions are fucking relative.

639
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,998
那现在怎么样？
So how is this?

640
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:58,799
-相对而言？  -比早上好
-Relatively speaking?  -Better than this morning.

641
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,870
好的  谢谢
All right, thanks.

642
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,629
医生  走之前爽爽么？
Poke a girl before you go, Doc?

643
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,356
Well  轮流检查检查她们的阴部吧
Well, change off rummaging their twats.

644
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:12,229
我希望你没和新到的中国妓女联系
I hope you ain't connected with them new Chinese prostitutes.

645
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:15,875
我没有  但我正在尝试和她们的皮条客做朋友
I ain't. But I did try to make friends with their pimp.

646
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:17,714
Yeah
Yeah.

647
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,110
-我们需要支援  －本地的？
-We need to muscle up. -Local?

648
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:26,515
-不知道能带来谁  -Well  派我去夏延吧
-Don't know who's been bought. -Well, send me to Cheyenne.

649
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:29,877
你去  我想留你在身边
You go. I want you close.

650
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,794
我想我要出去看看
I think I'll take a look outside.

651
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,198
那个树林大盗怎么样
What about that forest fucking type...

652
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,111
就是你过去在见到我之前一起抢劫的那个
you used to maraud with before you met me?

653
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,235
Crop Ear?
Crop Ear?

654
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,912
Yeah  他少个号角
Yeah, he lacked the use of a fucking horn.

655
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,399
用不上他了
He ain't available.

656
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,238
Yeah  我最近没听说过他  丹
Yeah, didn't I hear lately, Dan...

657
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:46,912
Crop Ear去别处抢劫了
Crop Ear's been marauding elsewheres?

658
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,228
Yep
Yep.

659
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:51,153
别让我们跟三胞胎似的一起出现
Let's not appear as fucking triplets, huh?

660
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,792
从后面下去  你们俩
Go back down, both of you.

661
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,509
还要拖着一部分体重[半身不遂]
Took some fucking portion of the relative fucking weight.

662
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,352
来  来
Come on, come on.

663
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,236
谁伸出个手
Someone put a hand out.

664
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,072
-谁拿到了 -Enid.
-Who got it?  -Enid.

665
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:04,072
-分成三份 Enid. -谢谢  乔安妮
