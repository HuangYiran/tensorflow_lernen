唐顿庄园
第四季  第八集

10
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,160
我想Drewe知道我们来了
I assume Drewe knows we're coming.

11
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,100
是的 我昨天送了便条
Yes. I sent a note yesterday.

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,160
那些猪好些了吗
So have the pigs recovered, do you think?

13
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,487
刚开始它们有点吓到我
They look in good shape to me,

14
00:00:46,488 --> 00:00:48,020
不过现在好多了
after the shock of their arrival.

15
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,140
可是他怎么不来检查下
But why didn't he check to see

16
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,180
猪夜里饮用的水够不够
... they all had water before he left for the night?

17
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,020
他可能以为把水槽里装满了就行了
Maybe he thought a full trough was enough.

18
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,980
他也没想到这些猪把水槽踢翻了
He wasn't to know they'd kick it over.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,229
Branson先生说的对
Mr Branson is right.

20
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:58,080
他应该再检查一遍的
He should have made sure.

21
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,220
你也该如此
You would have done.

22
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,120
你知道怎么养猪吗
Where did you learn about pigs?

23
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,180
我们在紫衫农场一直都有养猪 夫人
We've always had pigs at Yew Tree, m'lady.

24
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,220
不是很多 但也足够摸清它们的秉性了
Not many, but enough to learn their ways.

25
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,160
还好你养过
Thank heavens you did.

26
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,020
你找到接管这事的人了吗
So, have you found a man to take over?

27
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,200
还没
Not yet.

28
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,220
不过我想知道 你对这工作感兴趣吗
First, we'd like to know if you'd want the job.

29
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,030
我吗 你指的是我去喂养
Me? You mean I'm to manage

30
00:01:20,031 --> 00:01:23,060
庄园地产上的和我们自己农场的猪吗
the pigs for the estate, as well as my farm?

31
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,140
这要求是多了点
It's asking a lot.

32
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,140
我可以的 如果你们确定的话
I can do it. If you're sure.

33
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,080
我们可以试试 再看怎么继续干下去
Let's give it a try, see how we get on.

34
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,100
我很感激 夫人
I'm very grateful, m'lady.

35
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,060
这是你们家族给我的第二次恩惠了
This is the second good turn I've received from your family,

36
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,040
我只希望有一天可以回报
and I just hope I can pay back a favour one day.

37
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,140
你真的太善良了
How nice of you.

38
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,140
我不知道这算不算恩惠
I don't know if it's much of a favour.

39
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,692
我们给你的活太多了
We're giving you a lot of work.

40
00:01:45,693 --> 00:01:47,140
工作就像老龄
Work's like old age, m'lady.

41
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,240
虽然让人厌恶 但也不可或缺
The worst thing in the world except for the alternative.

42
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,200
是我罢了
It's only me.

43
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,650
我总认为这个问候语
I always feel that greeting betrays

44
00:02:00,651 --> 00:02:03,080
有点自轻自贱的意味
such a lack of self worth.

45
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,140
你今天怎么样
How are we today?

46
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,384
亲爱的 别这样对我说话
My dear, please stop

47
00:02:08,385 --> 00:02:11,140
显着我像个无药可救的孩子
talking to me as if I were a child past hope.

48
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,140
好吧 你现在感觉如何
Very well. How are you feeling?

49
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,180
像Manette医生似得
Like Doctor Manette.

50
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,180
{\a6}Manette医生-双城记里的人物 在长期囚禁下未老先衰

51
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,120
我要是再不出门
If I don't get out of this house soon,

52
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,140
恐怕我就只记得自己的岁数了
I shall remember nothing but my number.

53
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,592
要不我们下午走去庄园吧
Then why don't we walk to the Abbey this afternoon,

54
00:02:22,593 --> 00:02:23,200
可以吗
if it's fine?

55
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,220
听听Robert的美国之行
Hear how Robert's getting on in America.

56
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,180
那真的是唤作茶壶圆顶绯闻吗
Is it really called the Tea Pot Dome scandal?

57
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,180
{\a6}1920-1923年在美国发生的著名受贿丑闻

58
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,100
- 听起来不可思议   - 关于什么的
- It seems so unlikely.  - What's it about?

59
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,240
- 还不是老一套 无非是贿赂跟腐败呗
- What is it always about? Bribery and corruption.

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,060
拿了好处 允许私企
Taking money to allow private companies

61
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,160
在政府的土地开采石油
to drill for oil on Government land.

62
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,180
Levinson先生的公司是其一吗
Mr Levinson has one of these companies?

63
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,060
我想是如此
I assume so.

64
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,410
你见过他吗
Have you ever met him?

65
00:02:47,411 --> 00:02:49,140
就一次 在当年的婚礼上
Once. At the wedding.

66
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,080
但那一次就足够了
And once was quite enough.

67
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,055
我没法告诉你那有多令人兴奋呢
I can't tell you how thrilling that sounds.

68
00:02:55,056 --> 00:02:56,180
我会等你
I'll be waiting for you.

69
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,040
我们会度过美好的一天
We'll have such a lovely day.

70
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,060
- 那是谁   - 一个朋友而已
- Who was that? - No-one. Just a friend.

71
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,100
你得为义卖多出点力了
You have to pull your weight with the bazaar.

72
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,060
感觉这都成我一人的事了
It seems to have crept up on me.

73
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,020
Robert表哥经常组织这些事吗
Does Cousin Robert usually do it?

74
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,100
是的 村子里的人互相看不顺眼
He does. Half the village hates the other half

75
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,920
只有他能阻止
and he's the only one who can stop them

76
00:03:12,921 --> 00:03:15,020
他们互相斗嘴了
tearing each other's throats out.

77
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,140
真羡慕 这是真手艺啊
I admire that. It's a real skill.

78
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,160
Molesley先生
Mr Molesley, erm,

79
00:03:35,161 --> 00:03:37,240
你曾经做过贴身男仆是吗
is it true that you were a valet?

80
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,120
还是服伺已故的Crawley先生是吗
For the late Mr Crawley?

81
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:42,020
是的 在此之前是Crawley先生母亲的管家
And butler to his mother before that.

82
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,511
最近我的生活很不顺
I've come down in the world.

83
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,100
你会再爬起来的
You can climb up again.

84
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,000
也许吧 但生活有时会
Maybe. But life kicks the

85
00:03:48,001 --> 00:03:51,160
踢你一脚呢 对吧
stuffing out of you sometimes, doesn't it?

86
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,220
噢 那我可跌下不止一次了
Oh, I've had my stuffing kicked out more than once.

87
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,100
我曾醒来想着这到底有没有意义呢
I've woken and wondered if there was any point to it.

88
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,080
现在呢 我是伯爵夫人的贴身女仆
Yet here I am, lady's maid to a countess.

89
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,080
所以 一切都会好的
So, it can happen.

90
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,040
你现在让我很好奇了
Now you've made me curious.

91
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:11,200
我也在好奇一些事 你也许能给我答案
I'm curious about something and you could help me.

92
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:17,100
你知道Bates夫妇吵架了吗
Do you know if Mr and Mrs Bates have had a falling out?

93
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,980
Bates夫妻吗 不大可能吧
Mr and Mrs Bates? That doesn't sound very likely.

94
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,020
你可以把那个机器挪开吗
Can I ask you to put that machine away?

95
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,040
- 我们马上要准备茶了   - 好的
- We'll be laying for tea in a minute. - Of course.

96
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,200
大家都准备好仆人的茶了吗
Is everything ready for the servants' tea?

97
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,210
到底是我一人 还是大家的
Oh, is it just me or do we

98
00:04:33,211 --> 00:04:35,020
花销都比过去多了一倍
have twice the bills we used to?

99
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,040
Ivy 这是你的
Ivy, this is for you.

100
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,100
你找到去除水壶污垢的蛎壳粉了吗
Did you find those oyster shells for the kettle?

101
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,000
我已经放进去了 得等一会 里面都是生水垢
I've put them in. About time. It were full of scale.

102
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,020
那信里到底写的什么啊
What in God's name was that about?

103
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,258
别小题大做 她只是
Don't rise to it. She just

104
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:54,180
故意想让我们觉得她日子很有趣呢
wants us to think her life's interesting.

105
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,618
有啥趣事吗
Anything interesting?

106
00:05:00,619 --> 00:05:02,040
我在读郡的政报
I'm reading about County Politics.

107
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,240
他们正在招募地方议会的候选人
They're looking for candidates for the local Council.

108
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,060
你怎么不自荐呢
Why don't you put yourself forward?

109
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,120
但我最近没去了解时政 没有把握
But what are my politics these days? I'm not sure.

110
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,120
你总可以了解些的
You could always read a bit about it.

111
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,879
这个房间里你找不到几本
You won't find many books

112
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,220
自由主义思想的书籍
on the Liberal ideals in this room.

113
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,120
更别提关于社会主义的了
And nothing at all about Socialism.

114
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:22,160
要是你真想明天把我载到瑟斯克
If you're serious about driving me to Thirsk tomorrow,

115
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,040
也许我们可以找到一些那方面的书
perhaps we might find some then.

116
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,020
你现在好多了吗 奶奶
Are you better now, Granny?

117
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,980
你要是来看望过我 你就知道了
If you'd been to see me, you'd know.

118
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,980
别取笑我了 我又不是那照顾人的料
Don't bully me. I'm not up to it.

119
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,100
是啊 Rosamund都告诉我了
No. Rosamund told me.

120
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,100
什么时候 她说什么了
When? What did she say?

121
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,240
你只是需要点关爱罢了
Only that you needed a little cherishing, that's all.

122
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,020
这么说Drewe接受了你提议的工作
So Mr Drewe's accepted your officer.

123
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,140
我很高兴
I'm so pleased.

124
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,040
Drewe一家在紫衫农场做了很多年
The Drewes have been at Yew Tree Farm for many years.

125
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:53,960
我以为你要说他
I suppose you think

126
00:05:53,961 --> 00:05:56,020
是感情用事的人呢 Blake先生
that's sentimental bosh, Mr Blake.

127
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,140
别为难他 奶奶
Don't be too hard on him, Granny.

128
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,920
Blake先生比他给我们的
Mr Blake has a softer side

129
00:05:59,921 --> 00:06:01,140
第一映象要友善多了
than we first gave him credit for.

130
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,471
在我们启程去伦敦前
I'm relieved to hear I am redeemed

131
00:06:02,472 --> 00:06:04,220
知道你原谅了我真是个宽慰
before we leave for London.

132
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,060
希望你也原谅我
I hope I'm forgiven, too.

133
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,992
我知道你第一次见我时
I know you thought me very snobbish

134
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:10,140
觉得我很势利
when you first arrived.

135
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,688
我没怪你 我来时
I don't blame you. Given my work,

136
00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:15,140
可是作为国家敌人的特使
I came as an envoy of the enemy.

137
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,700
是我们来早了吗
Are we too early?

138
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:18,240
保姆 把他们抱进来吧
Bring them in, Nanny.

139
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,100
我想没人介意吧
I don't think anyone will mind.

140
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,060
你爸爸可能会 不过他不在这里 哪来抱怨
Your Papa might, but he isn't here to complain.

141
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,020
等一会 宝贝 妈妈放下杯子
One moment, darling, while Mummy puts away her cup.

142
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,160
来 过来这里 我宝宝 你好啊 小子
Oh, here, let me. Hello there.

143
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,100
对 真乖
Oh, it's all right.

144
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,180
小家伙长得真壮实
He's turning into quite a bruiser.

145
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,514
我得走了
Yes, and I must go.

146
00:06:36,515 --> 00:06:38,120
留下来吃晚餐 妈妈
Stay and have some dinner, Mama.

147
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,382
你不必换晚装
You needn't change.

148
00:06:39,383 --> 00:06:41,040
不了 谢谢 亲爱的 真的不用
No. Thank you, my dear, but no.

149
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,220
你应该要更衣了 我则该走了
You should change and I should go.

150
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,302
你下楼时能不能帮我
When you go down,

151
00:06:51,303 --> 00:06:53,040
带个话给Hughes夫人
can you give a message to Mrs Hughes?

152
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,080
当然好
Of course.

153
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,180
Gillingham昨天打电话过来
Lord Gillingham telephoned today.

154
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,140
明天晚上他想回家之前
He wants to break his journey home.

155
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,000
顺便过来这里
Tomorrow night.

156
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,220
他又来了吗
He'll be here again?

157
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,020
是的 我真不该鼓励他
You're right. I shouldn't encourage him,

158
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:11,160
可是我想不到别的话叫他不要来
but I couldn't think what to say to persuade him not to.

159
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,240
你会觉得我很懦弱吗
Do you think me very feeble?

160
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,140
不是的 夫人
It's not that, m'lady.

161
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,120
那怎么了
Then what is it?

162
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,040
Anna
Anna?

163
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,003
这不是你该烦恼的事
It's nothing to bother you with.

164
00:07:30,004 --> 00:07:31,080
拜托麻烦我吧
Please bother me.

165
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,160
要是我告诉你 你得保证你听过就罢
If I did, you'd have to promise to do nothing about it.

166
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:41,140
可这关Gillingham伯爵什么事呢
But how does this concern Lord Gillingham?

167
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,345
不是的 夫人
It doesn't, m'lady.

168
00:07:43,346 --> 00:07:46,240
这跟Gillingham伯爵无关
It's nothing to do with Lord Gillingham himself.

169
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,180
- 那   - 是他的男仆 夫人
- But then...  - It's his man, m'lady.

170
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,160
他的仆人 跟他一起旅行的Green先生
His servant, Mr Green, who travels with him.

171
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,120
噢 天哪
Oh, my God.

172
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,020
- 可是警察应该   - 不可以
- But the police ought to...  - No!

173
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,485
我必须要告诉Gillingham伯爵
I must tell Lord Gillingham.

174
00:08:05,486 --> 00:08:06,240
不 夫人 你答应过的
No, m'lady, you promised.

175
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Bates先生还不知道是他
Mr Bates doesn't know it was him.

176
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,080
但他来的次数越多
But the more he comes here,

177
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,000
Bates先生越有可能发现他是犯人
the more likely it is that Mr Bates will find out.

178
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,548
那我就电话告诉他
Then I'll telephone him and

179
00:08:14,549 --> 00:08:17,040
不要过来了 或者别带Green先生来
tell him not to come, or not to bring Green.

180
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,207
每次Green来这里
I'm frightened every time

181
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,180
跟Bates先生在同一房间时我都很害怕
Mr Green and Mr Bates are in the same room.

182
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,240
你是想他要是猜到了会做蠢事吧
You think, if he guesses, he'll do something.

183
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,160
如果他真那么做了 他们会绞死他的
And if he does, they'll hang him.

184
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,020
或是把他关进大牢 让他永世不能翻身
Or lock him up and throw away the key.

185
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,420
Jimmy 开胃菜可以端上去了
Jimmy, the savouries can go in

186
00:08:32,421 --> 00:08:34,100
Daisy会把沙司送过去
and Daisy'll bring up the sauce.

187
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,080
现在 或许你能解释给我听
And now perhaps you can explain why

188
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,481
为什么你从晚餐时起
you have apparently been under hypnosis

189
00:08:40,482 --> 00:08:42,140
就像被催眠了一样在走神呢
since dinner began.

190
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,426
我不明白您什么意思
I don't know what you mean.

191
00:08:43,427 --> 00:08:44,240
你知道我的意思
Yes, you do.

192
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,140
像树懒一样悠闲地躺在水里
Mooning about like a sloth under water.

193
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,060
说吧
Well?

194
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,180
你知道我早上收到了一封信吗
You know I had a letter earlier?

195
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,861
是Alfred写来的信
It were from Alfred.

196
00:08:52,862 --> 00:08:54,140
好像是他的父亲过世了
It seems his father died

197
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,000
他要回来参加葬礼
and Alfred's coming up for the funeral.

198
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,080
- 我很遗憾   - 还不止这些
- Oh, I am sorry.   - That's not all.

199
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,020
他说他想娶我
He says he wants to marry me.

200
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,020
什么  信里是这么说的吗
What?! Just like that?

201
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,381
他说上次他离开时
He says the way I behaved towards him

202
00:09:04,382 --> 00:09:06,020
我看起来很喜欢他的样子
when he were last here

203
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,140
他希望我们俩之间能有更进一步的发展
made him hope that things had changed between us.

204
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,180
- 你是表现得挺“友好”的   - 还有
- Well, you were very friendly.   - That's not all.

205
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,060
他希望我能离开唐顿  和他一同去伦敦
He wants me to leave Downton and go up to London.

206
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,320
他说他能帮我找到一份工作
He says he can find me a job.

207
00:09:16,321 --> 00:09:16,980
上帝啊
Blimey.

208
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,478
Alfred在信里写了这么多内容
He puts a lot in a letter,

209
00:09:18,479 --> 00:09:19,000
他写得还真多
does Alfred.

210
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,564
开胃菜端上桌了
They're serving the savouries.

211
00:09:20,565 --> 00:09:21,980
这事我们待会儿再说
We'll talk about it later.

212
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,160
现在 把水烧上 准备煮咖啡
Now, er, put the water on for the coffee.

213
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,018
今天做得事情够多了
That's enough for one day, surely.

214
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:37,040
剩下的明天再做吧
You can finish them tomorrow.

215
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,212
我们散步回村舍吧
Shall we walk back to the cottage?

216
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:42,060
其他人都准备去睡了
The others are going to bed.

217
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,100
你和Hughes太太说了什么
What were you saying to Mrs Hughes?

218
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,627
就是Gillingham勋爵
Just that Lord Gillingham's asked himself

219
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:48,060
要再来这里来过夜
for the night again.

220
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,120
他还真是不放手啊
He can't stay away.

221
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,180
是啊  是有点混乱
Yes. It's a bit of a tangle.

222
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,980
你觉得她对他还有好感吗
Do you think she's sweet on him?

223
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,323
他们互有好感
They're sweet on each other,

224
00:09:57,324 --> 00:09:59,120
可是这事没看起来得那么简单
but it's not as simple as that, is it?

225
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,682
现在又加上了Blake先生
Then there's Mr Blake.

226
00:10:02,683 --> 00:10:04,200
我还以为她不喜欢他
I thought she didn't like him.

227
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:07,160
她起先是不喜欢
She didn't. At first.

228
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,200
总之 他们会处理好他们之间的关系的
Anyway, they can sort it out between them.

229
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,140
Green先生
And Mr Green.

230
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,200
他也会来
He'll be coming back.

231
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,060
你对他没热情了吗
Have you gone off him?

232
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,980
为什么这么说
Why do you say that?

233
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,060
他刚来的时候你非常喜欢他
You liked him so much when he first came.

234
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,980
- 你觉得他很有趣   - 我有吗
- You thought he was funny.   - Did I?

235
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
我记不清了
I can't remember.

236
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,680
你对Drewe先生很满意了
So, you're pleased with Mr Drewe?

237
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,155
是的  我也对小猪们很满意
I am. And I'm very pleased with the pigs too.

238
00:10:44,156 --> 00:10:45,520
它们的状态很不错
They're a grand addition.

239
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,448
这些事情都搞定后
When they've settled,

240
00:10:46,449 --> 00:10:47,660
你就可以去忙牛奶场的事了
you ought to consider dairy.

241
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,600
给表现出色的Drewe先生另一份工作吗
Another job for the splendid Mr Drewe.

242
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,480
我认为他表现得确实很出色
I think he IS rather splendid.

243
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,551
看起来他想要把毕生
He seems to want to make farming

244
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:54,720
都奉献给唐顿的农事上
at Downton his life's work.

245
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,560
这话说得很有腔调
That's very lyrical.

246
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,740
Rosamund Painswick夫人打来电话
Lady Rosamund Painswick is on the telephone, m'lady.

247
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,580
今天有什么安排吗
Do you have anything planned for today?

248
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,720
逛街  就这么多
Some shopping. That's all.

249
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,700
你觉得我应该给他回信吗
Do you think I should write and give him my answer?

250
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,140
如果你考虑好了
If you're sure about it.

251
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:16,680
我不想嫁给Alfred
I don't want to marry Alfred.

252
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,600
那就没必要多说什么了
Then there's no more to be said.

253
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,600
即使我想 但我还不想现在就把自己束缚住
Even if I did, I wouldn't care to tie myself down yet.

254
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,680
我怎么能知道以后的日子会是什么样的呢
How do I know what life has in store?

255
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,600
你是乐观的一代人 我只能这么说
You're a very optimistic generation, I'll say that.

256
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,640
- 你们在聊什么   - 没什么
- What are you talking about?   - Nothing.

257
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,276
我希望你告诉我
I wish you'd say,

258
00:11:31,277 --> 00:11:33,500
因为很明显你心里藏着事
cos it's clear as day you're up to something.

259
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,580
我们都不知道爸爸什么时候回来
None of us know when Papa's coming back.

260
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,640
不过是的 我们必须在他回来前告诉她
But yes, we must tell her before then.

261
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,500
实际上 我已经有主意了
In fact, I've had an idea.

262
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,560
如果你已经确定了 那为什么不呢
Well, if you're sure, then why not?

263
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,676
Mary的朋友们已经在这里住下了
We've already got friends of Mary staying.

264
00:11:49,677 --> 00:11:51,520
车票订好了再电话联系
Ring with the train time.

265
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,640
“亲爱的 再见”
'Bye-bye dear.'

266
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,813
谁的电话
Who was that?

267
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,480
Rosamund姑妈的
Aunt Rosamund.

268
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,088
她要来探望祖母
She's coming to see how Granny is.

269
00:11:58,089 --> 00:11:59,677
你怎么这么早就下来了
Why are you down so early?

270
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,973
我要在Tom出发去 Thirsk之前
I've got to check some

271
00:12:00,974 --> 00:12:03,560
和他核对好账目数据
figures with Tom before he goes into Thirsk.

272
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,620
越来越像位女实业家了
Quite the businesswoman.

273
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,500
我们要迎接生活发来的挑战
We must rise to life's challenges.

274
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,580
是啊 我想是的
Yes, I suppose we must.

275
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,640
十分钟后咱们在书店见
Let's meet in the book shop in ten minutes.

276
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,580
我有一些信要寄出去  就在那儿见
I've got some letters to post. I'll see you there.

277
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,540
谢谢你
Thank you.

278
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,740
日安
Good day.

279
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,660
别 别这么做
Don't, don't do that.

280
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,560
你没必要这么小心翼翼
You mustn't be so self-conscious.

281
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,660
一个黑人歌手和
A black singer with the

282
00:13:01,661 --> 00:13:03,680
侯爵的女儿在约克郡的小镇上见面
daughter of a marquess in a Yorkshire town?

283
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,375
我们干嘛要这么吸引别人的注意力
Why should we attract any attention?

284
00:13:06,376 --> 00:13:07,580
那是他们的问题
Well, that's their problem.

285
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,500
我们不用理会
It doesn't have to be ours.

286
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,680
你到这儿来让我兴奋得快要窒息了
I'm terribly puffed that you made the journey.

287
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,560
- 我也是 可是   - 可是什么
- Me too, but...   - But what?

288
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,846
我希望我们两人能勇敢地面对这事
I hope we're brave enough for this.

289
00:13:20,847 --> 00:13:21,640
我们当然会
Of course we are!

290
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,620
这不就是让那些心胸狭隘的人们意识到
Isn't it time people knew there are bigger and better

291
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,549
他们应该有更为宽广和
values than the mean-

292
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,640
更为优越的价值观的时候吗
spirited ones they live by?

293
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,500
Grantham夫人知道你今天出来吗
Does Lady Grantham know you're out for the day?

294
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,540
只要我按时回去吃晚餐就没问题
It won't matter as long as I'm back for dinner.

295
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,109
你今晚有演出吗
Are you playing tonight?

296
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,680
有演出的话我就不会来了
I wouldn't be here if I were.

297
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,600
你想让我待多久我就可以留多久
I can stay for as long as you want.

298
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,551
我希望你永远都留在这儿
Well, I want you to stay forever,

299
00:13:40,552 --> 00:13:41,740
可是六点钟就够了
but six o'clock will do.

300
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,640
你今天怎么这么沉默  发生了什么事
You're not very talkative. What's the matter?

301
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,600
我在考虑一些人所处的场合
I was thinking about a couple of people

302
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,720
可能会给他们带来麻烦
who are in a situation which will cause trouble.

303
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,620
这会让他们不快吗
Will it make them unhappy?

304
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,660
不好说
It's hard to say.

305
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,500
这会让某些人不开心
It'll make some people unhappy.

306
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,720
我要煮些咖啡喝  你要来一杯吗
I thought I might make some coffee. Would you like a cup?

307
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,660
不了 谢谢你
No, thank you.

308
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,585
只是咖啡而已  你没必要
It's just coffee. You won't

309
00:14:07,586 --> 00:14:10,620
把自己独立封锁起来
have to surrender any of your independence.

310
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,620
好吧 你赢了
Er, you win.

311
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,600
加牛奶 不加糖
Er, milk but no sugar.

312
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,480
Baxter小姐
Miss Baxter,

313
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,580
我明白你的感受 脆弱的感觉
I do know what it's like, to feel fragile.

314
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,520
我这辈子都挺脆弱的
I've felt fragile my whole life.

315
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,520
现在你也能感受得到 就在这儿
You'll have realised by now that, down here,

316
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,588
我们不怎么喜欢Barrow先生
we don't much care for Mr Barrow,

317
00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:36,740
这话可能有点冒犯你
which may offend you.

318
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,660
我没感觉到冒犯
I'm not...offended.

319
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,092
可我希望你给予我们信任
But I wish you'd give us

320
00:14:41,093 --> 00:14:43,740
让我们对你有个不一样的评价
credit for making up our own minds about you.

321
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,620
你们好
Hello.

322
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,768
这位小姐是
This is Miss...

323
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:58,540
Bunting 我叫Sarah Bunting
Bunting. Sarah Bunting.

324
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,520
这位是Crawley夫人
And this is Mrs Crawley.

325
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,080
{\a6}==BTM字幕组出品==

326
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,003
我是在你让我去参加的那个政治集会
I met Miss Bunting at the

327
00:15:02,004 --> 00:15:03,801
上认识Bunting小姐的
political meeting you sent me to.

328
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:04,520
在里彭的那个
In Ripon.

329
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,328
原来如此
Ah, so that was the reason.

330
00:15:06,329 --> 00:15:07,520
什么意思
Why do you say that?

331
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,902
他对自由主义者的事业
He wasn't exactly enthralled to

332
00:15:08,903 --> 00:15:09,720
并不完全热衷
the cause of the Liberals.

333
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,605
虽然现在我对他的社会主义论
Though I'm not now convinced

334
00:15:11,606 --> 00:15:13,720
- 也不怎么信服   - 为什么不信服
- by his Socialism.   - Why not?

335
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,711
我那时还不知道你是土地中介
I didn't know then that you were the land agent

336
00:15:16,712 --> 00:15:17,560
而且还是
and son-in-law

337
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,113
我们地方乡绅的女婿
of our local milord.

338
00:15:19,114 --> 00:15:20,520
原来我还这么出名呢
I'm surprised I'm so famous.

339
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,520
你不为自己的原则而战吗
Won't you defend your principles?

340
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,500
不 以后再说吧
No, not now.

341
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,208
那我来捍卫  Branson先生
Then I will. Mr Branson

342
00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:27,580
是一位目光锐利的政治思想家
is a keen political thinker.

343
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,713
他毫不畏惧去质疑自己的信仰
He proves this by not being afraid to

344
00:15:29,714 --> 00:15:30,700
这就能证明这点
question his own beliefs.

345
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,943
口才够雄辩
Very eloquent.

346
00:15:31,944 --> 00:15:34,740
我想留下来同您辩论 可我要迟到了
I'd stay to argue, but I'm late.

347
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,660
你住在附近吗
Do you live around here?

348
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,560
我在这儿附近工作
I work here.

349
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,580
在一所学校里
At the school.

350
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,500
很高兴再次见到你
It was nice to see you again.

351
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,740
- 小姐 你好  - 你们好
- Hello, Miss.   - Hello.

352
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,127
她的思想很独立
She knows her own mind.

353
00:15:51,128 --> 00:15:52,620
是的 她确实是这样
Yes, I think she does.

354
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,665
很显然 早餐后
Apparently, he left

355
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:57,560
他就直接同Dalrymples辞别了
the Dalrymples straight after breakfast,

356
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,500
所以我打电话过去时他已经走了
so I missed him when I telephoned.

357
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:04,660
- 您已经尽全力了   - 我真的很抱歉
- You did your best.   - I am so sorry.

358
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,700
进来
Come in!

359
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,540
你没穿燕尾服吗 你知道祖母要过来的
No tails? You know Granny's coming.

360
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,680
天啊 她要来吗  我不知道这事
Oh, God, is she? I didn't realise.

361
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,260
算了 别换了
No, don't change.

362
00:16:17,261 --> 00:16:19,600
她也该见识一下现实世界了
It's time she learned about the real world.

363
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,660
这话意味深长啊
A phrase with more than one definition.

364
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,580
我能和你说个事吗
Can I have a word?

365
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,500
我看到一些事情
I've seen something,

366
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,680
可是我不是说这件事有什么不妥当
and I'm not saying there's anything wrong about it,

367
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,540
只是如果我隐瞒了它的话 我会感觉很不舒服
but I'd feel uncomfortable if I kept it to myself.

368
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,560
洗耳恭听
I'm all ears.

369
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:43,480
今天早晨 在瑟斯克  我看到了Rose
This morning in Thirsk,... I saw Rose.

370
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,500
没错 她在逛街啊
Yes, she was shopping.

371
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,540
不 她没在逛街
No, she was not shopping.

372
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,700
她在和一个男人约会
She was...meeting a man.

373
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,560
她伸手抚摸那人的脸颊时刚好被我看到了
I saw her as she reached up to stroke his cheek.

374
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,720
天啊  这次又是和谁
Oh, golly. Who is it this time?

375
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,254
是Jack Ross
It was Jack Ross -

376
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:03,600
那个请来为你父亲庆生
the singer with the band

377
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,560
的乐队歌手
who came up for your father's party.

378
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,428
就这些  我都告诉你了
Well, that's it. I've told you

379
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:08,660
其他的就没什么了
and I have nothing more to add.

380
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,640
Anna
Anna?

381
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,600
她已经告诉你了 是吗
She's told you, then?

382
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:26,580
不要告诉别人 Hughes太太 拜托了
Don't give me away Mrs Hughes, please.

383
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,700
我熬得过去
I can get through it.

384
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,560
我的女仆说你在这里等我
My maid said you were waiting in here.

385
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,540
其他人都在客厅
Everyone else is in the drawing room.

386
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,620
我知道 可是我想你可能想知道
I know, but I thought you'd want to hear.

387
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:43,480
我想我有办法保住孩子了
I think I know how I can keep the baby.

388
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,580
什么  怎么保
What? How?

389
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,520
有一个佃农
There's a tenant farmer,

390
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,960
他们家一直在为唐顿服务
whose family has been at Downton for years.

391
00:17:50,961 --> 00:17:52,480
我相信他是值得托付的人
I'm sure he can be trusted.

392
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,560
这样风险太大了
This is very reckless.

393
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,600
可 那您什么建议呢
Well, what would you suggest?

394
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:03,520
我的建议是我们离开这儿
I'd suggest that we go away,

395
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,680
你和我 去远途旅行  无论去哪都行
you and me, on an extended trip to...somewhere.

396
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,918
那么孩子
Then the baby can be

397
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,720
就能被某个国家无子嗣的夫妇收养
adopted by a childless couple in that country,

398
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,640
无论去哪个地方 他们都会喜出望外的
wherever it may be, and they are made very happy.

399
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,660
孩子也会很幸福 你也能
And the baby is happy, and you are...

400
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:20,520
就算不幸福 至少也是一种解脱
..Well, if not happy, at least free.

401
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:23,620
可我就不能伴着孩子长大了
But I wouldn't be part of its growing up?

402
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,520
你不能陪伴孩子一生
You wouldn't be part of its life.

403
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,660
为什么说我的主意不可行呢
Why is my idea so reckless?

404
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,680
亲爱的 我该怎么和你说呢
Oh my dear, where shall I start?

405
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,600
如果那个佃农泄露秘密了怎么办
Suppose the farmer talks?

406
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,720
如果有人看到你在他家中出入怎么办
Suppose you're seen visiting his home,

407
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,700
这就是你的主意吗
which I presume is the idea?

408
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,614
如果孩子长得像你
Suppose the baby looks like you

409
00:18:40,615 --> 00:18:42,720
被村民们发现了怎么办
and people in the village notice?

410
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:45,520
如果是你泄露的呢
Suppose you talk?

411
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,882
我把我需要的东西都写在单子上了
I left a list somewhere that

412
00:18:49,883 --> 00:18:51,520
交给了Patmore太太
I need for Mrs Patmore.

413
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,520
你知道Gillingham勋爵在这儿吗
You know Lord Gillingham is here.

414
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,011
知道  我们刚还聊天的来着
Er, yes. We were just chatting.

415
00:18:55,012 --> 00:18:55,600
我们马上就来
We're coming now.

416
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,520
我太想来管理这个集市了
I'm desperately trying to take control of the bazaar.

417
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,200
可实在是难以取悦大家
Talk about herding cats.

418
00:19:00,201 --> 00:19:01,640
需要的话 我留下来帮你
I'll stay and help if you want.

419
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,600
那你可就要后悔说这话了
You may regret saying that.

420
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,076
趁我在这里 我们可以
And while I'm here, we can

421
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:07,540
聊聊那个我决定了的计划
discuss a plan that I'd like to get settled.

422
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,700
我一直都想把法语说得更流利一些
I've always wanted to speak better French than I do,

423
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,704
所以我想离开这里几个月
so I thought I'd take a few months off,

424
00:19:15,705 --> 00:19:16,700
去瑞士
go to...Switzerland

425
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,525
切实学习一下
and really learn it.

426
00:19:18,526 --> 00:19:20,660
我明白了  不去法国吗
I see. Not France?

427
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,680
你知道法国就那个样子
You know what the French are like.

428
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,580
而瑞士更干净
While Switzerland is so clean.

429
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,680
他们有一流的医院  就是我们生病了也不怕
And they have wonderful hospitals... in case we get ill.

430
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,522
我们   - 不知道Edith
We?   - I wondered if Edith

431
00:19:31,523 --> 00:19:33,680
是不是也愿意来 陪我做个伴
might like to come. Keep me company.

432
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,620
费用算我的
I'll pay.

433
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,700
你是怎么想的
What do you have to say about that?

434
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,660
我愿意去
I'd like to.

435
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,740
天啊  那好吧 没理由拒绝啊
Goodness. Oh. Well,...why not?

436
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,600
天啊 生活中的惊喜真是无处不在
Golly, life is full of surprises.

437
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,932
可我最好先去确定
But I'd better check to

438
00:19:49,933 --> 00:19:52,500
一下那些小家伙们没有调皮捣乱
see that the young men are keeping the peace.

439
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,560
那我们不告诉她吗
So we won't have to tell her?

440
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,500
我认为没必要 你觉得呢
I don't think we need to, do you?

441
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,751
可你真能支付得起
Can you really afford to

442
00:20:06,752 --> 00:20:10,560
在阿尔卑斯山看四个月小说的花费吗
spend four months reading novels in the Alps?

443
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:13,540
既然已经做决定了 就没必要再问其他问题了
Why ask the question when the decision has been made?

444
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,700
来吧 我们回到他们中去
Come on, we ought to join the others.

445
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,600
我们上次见面后 你又游历过苏格兰吗
Have you been wandering round Scotland since we saw you?

446
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,540
我来过  我去了Spey
I have. I was on the Spey.

447
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,582
去拜访了堂兄
I did a tour of the cousinage,

448
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,480
然后去艾尔郡参加了一场婚礼
then a wedding in Ayrshire.

449
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,756
我玩得很惬意
I've enjoyed myself.

450
00:20:29,757 --> 00:20:31,640
旅行给了我时间去思考过往
It gave me time to think for once.

451
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,700
有什么与众不同的吗
Oh, what about particularly?

452
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,500
我的人生改变了 我想是这样
My life, I suppose.

453
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,600
有时每个人都应该这样
Everyone should, from time to time.

454
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,855
我可不同意
Oh, I can't agree.

455
00:20:39,856 --> 00:20:42,680
从我的经验来看 这是个危险的职业
In my experience it's a dangerous occupation.

456
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,706
危险
Dangerous?

457
00:20:43,707 --> 00:20:45,720
是的 如果你思考得太多
Well, no life appears rewarding

458
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,600
人生就没喜乐之事了
if you think too much about it.

459
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,680
我听说你最近开始养猪了
I gather you've launched into pigs these days.

460
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,600
是的  它们给了我一份颇具挑战性的工作
Yes. And their arrival was quite the adventure,

461
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:57,520
这多亏了Blake先生和Mary的英勇之举
in which Mr Blake and Mary were the hero and heroine.

462
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,740
这就是我上次过来时 你没告诉我的事情吗
Is this what you wouldn't tell me when I was last here?

463
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,520
我只是不想为此沾沾自喜
Only because I didn't want to make too much of it.

464
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,154
Mary小姐当时的表现很出色
Lady Mary was perfectly splendid.

465
00:21:05,155 --> 00:21:06,720
Mary小姐一直都很出色
Lady Mary IS perfectly splendid.

466
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:09,620
Charles 说真的 你也是养猪专家吗
Really, Charles, are you a pig expert, as well?

467
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,500
谢天谢地 还好那晚有他在
He was that night, thank heaven.

468
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,720
Rosamund和Edith有好消息要公布
Rosamund and Edith have some exciting news.

469
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,560
什么消息
What's that?

470
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,600
我么要去度假
We're going on a sabbatical

471
00:21:17,601 --> 00:21:19,640
去真正提升一下我们的法语水平
so we can really improve our French.

472
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,032
我从女家教那儿
The only thing I ever learned

473
00:21:21,033 --> 00:21:22,600
学到的只是怎么说
from my governess was how to say

474
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:25,640
“请”“谢谢”和“我发烧了”
"Please", "Thank you" And "I have a temperature."

475
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,740
在旅行的时候还是挺有用的
Very useful if one were travelling.

476
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,680
你还记得她吗 妈妈   她总是泪眼汪汪的
Do you remember her, Mama? She was always in tears.

477
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,406
可怜的Mademoiselle
Oh, poor Mademoiselle.

478
00:21:33,407 --> 00:21:34,680
她的生活太复杂了
Her life was full of... complications.

479
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,520
不过 我觉得她倒是乐享其中
I think she quite enjoyed it, though.

480
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,620
你也要去  你不是不想学法语的吗
But why you? You don't want to learn French.

481
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,933
还是借此隐姓埋名
Or is this an incognito

482
00:21:41,934 --> 00:21:44,520
去寻找销声匿迹的Gregson先生吗
search for the missing Mr Gregson?

483
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:47,520
别戳她的伤心事  这事不能开玩笑
Don't tease her. It's much more serious than that.

484
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,520
谢谢你 Tom
Thank you, Tom.

485
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,030
如果你想知道的话
If you must know,

486
00:21:51,031 --> 00:21:52,520
我只想离开一段时间
I fancy getting away for a bit.

487
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,580
就像Gillingham勋爵一样
Oh. Like Lord Gillingham,

488
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,580
绕着高原思考人生
thinking his way around the Highlands.

489
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,210
我喜欢苏格兰  至少
I like Scotland, me. At least,

490
00:22:01,211 --> 00:22:02,560
我很愿意在那儿生活
I would if I'd ever been there.

491
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,560
我在那吃的一口沙子
Well, I've had a bellyful of heather and no mistake.

492
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,500
你不打算反驳他吗 Hughes女士
Aren't you going to fight back, Mrs Hughes?

493
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,660
Green先生知道他自己喜欢什么
Mr Green can think what he likes.

494
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,520
所以你很期待这次纽约之行了
So you're glad you're on your way to London?

495
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:19,480
我会尽量忍着不唱出声来的
It'll be all I can do to stop singing when I get in the car.

496
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,589
你去那住哪啊
Where do you live when you're there?

497
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,620
{\a6}美国纽约州首府

498
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,620
老爷在奥尔巴尼有套房子
His lordship's got a set at Albany.

499
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,480
- 离西部远吗   - 你开玩笑吧
- Is that handy for the West End? - You're joking.

500
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,560
皮卡迪利在这头  塞维尔街在那头
Piccadilly one end, Saville Row the other.

501
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,560
{\a6}伦敦繁华大街之一

502
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,740
- 噢 幸运的家伙   - 是啊
- Oh, you lucky tyke. - I am a lucky tyke.

503
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,012
Baxter小姐 你喜欢伦敦吗
Do you like London, Miss Baxter?

504
00:22:34,013 --> 00:22:34,640
一般吧
Not particularly.

505
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,640
我曾在那住过一段日子
I lived there at one time

506
00:22:36,641 --> 00:22:37,720
但我并不中意
but it didn't work for me.

507
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,687
你呢 Anna
What about you, Anna?

508
00:22:38,688 --> 00:22:40,700
你倾心于Green先生那样的生活吗
Do you fancy a taste of Mr Green's life?

509
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,500
我在这过的挺好的 谢谢
I'm happy where I am, thank you.

510
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:49,520
Rose又吵着我要去伦敦了
Rose was badgering me about going up to London again

511
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,791
但她最近去的太频了 你觉得呢
but she's been enough lately, don't you think?

512
00:22:51,792 --> 00:22:52,740
再同意不过了
I certainly do.

513
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,010
毕竟她和我们在一起就是
After all, she's got to

514
00:22:55,011 --> 00:22:56,520
为了多尝试尝试新事物的
have some novelty when we bring her out.

515
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:59,640
- 这也是   - 她可以帮着管理集市
- Quite right. - She can help with the bazaar.

516
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:02,580
这样能让她收收心
That'll take her mind off things.

517
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,560
问题是 管理一个成年人
Trouble is, parenting an adult

518
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,720
尤其是别人家的孩子可
especially when it's someone else's daughter

519
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:10,640
真需要提前商量好才行
is really a matter of mutual agreement.

520
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:13,560
这样该给她立多少规矩 我至少心里有个数
There's a limit to how much one can simply forbid.

521
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:16,600
嘘嘘 她来了 事实上 我有话要和她谈谈
Sshh. Here she is. Actually, I want a word with her.

522
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,368
Rose 亲爱的
Rose, darling.

523
00:23:18,369 --> 00:23:20,700
你等会儿能来我房间一下吗
Can I drag you into my room for a moment?

524
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,600
Anna 你能让我们单独谈谈吗
Anna, could you leave us for a minute?

525
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,500
当然
Of course.

526
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,134
你现在睡觉还太早了吧
This is early for you to go to bed.

527
00:23:35,135 --> 00:23:36,540
我今天挺累的
I had rather a tiring day.

528
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,740
我听说
So I heard.

529
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,520
我听说你今天过得很精彩
Well, I heard you had an interesting day.

530
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:44,700
这到底累不累 我想你应该比我清楚
Whether or not it was tiring, you know better than I.

531
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,660
谁告诉你的
Who told you?

532
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,220
亲爱的 我只是
My dear, all I want

533
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:52,640
不想让你的生活失控而已
is for you not to lose control of your life.

534
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,560
我爱他
I love him.

535
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:57,680
我不想听所谓的要同等种族的帝国
And I won't listen to any imperialist nonsense

536
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,560
主义的废话
about racial purity

537
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,520
更别提因为敢于追求梦想就要受到惩罚的事了
and how he should be horsewhipped for daring to dream.

538
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,520
你不明白我的意思吗
Don't you know me better than that?

539
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,720
我要和他结婚 Mary
I'm going to marry him, Mary.

540
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,453
我不在意这要付出什么代价
I don't care what it costs

541
00:24:07,454 --> 00:24:08,640
我是不会藏着掖着的
and I won't keep it a secret.

542
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,600
我一定会告诉我妈妈的
Not once I've told Mummy.

543
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,680
我就是想看到她听到消息那一刹那扭曲的脸庞
I want to see her face crumble when she finds out.

544
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,620
Rose
Rose!

545
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,420
我感觉我们是赶你走似的
I feel we're driving you away.

546
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,387
噢 不是的
Oh, hardly.

547
00:24:26,388 --> 00:24:28,440
我们已经在这待了很长时间了
We're in grave danger of outstaying our welcome.

548
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,540
如果不是Tony提供顺风车的话
If Tony hadn't offered us

549
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:30,620
我们还不知道要在这赖到什么时候呢
a lift we'd be here forever.

550
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,286
盼望你下次再来拜访
I hope you'll be back soon.

551
00:24:32,287 --> 00:24:33,580
祝你的集市举办顺利
Good luck with your bazaar.

552
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,645
那你不能留下来帮帮我吗
Can't you stay and lend me a hand?

553
00:24:35,646 --> 00:24:36,540
别诱惑我了
Don't tempt me.

554
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,460
我很感激你提出的明智建议
I'm so grateful for your advice and wisdom.

555
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,786
这不仅仅指的是
And not least for

556
00:24:40,787 --> 00:24:43,400
那次有效和满身泥水的救猪事件
the very practical and muddy pig rescue.

557
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,580
乐意为你效劳 小姐
Glad to be of service, m'lady.

558
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,470
你是直接到那吗
Are you going straight there?

559
00:24:51,471 --> 00:24:53,380
我们可能停下来吃午饭
We might stop for some lunch...

560
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,640
谢谢你提供便车
It's kind of you to give them a lift.

561
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,420
这纯属个人原因  我不想
Pure self interest. I

562
00:24:56,421 --> 00:24:58,560
让Charles呆在这 单独和你在一起
couldn't leave Charles here, alone with you.

563
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,400
你下次去南部的时候能来看看我吗
Will you let me see you when you're next down south?

564
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,500
你想说什么 Tony
What would be the point, Tony?

565
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,460
我是不会做你的情人的
I'm never going to be your mistress.

566
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,480
我不会做这样的事的
That's not me at all.

567
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,640
我已经下定决心准备取消订婚了
I've made up my mind to call off the engagement.

568
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,540
- Mabel知道吗   - 还不知道
- Does Mabel know? - Not yet.

569
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,570
从那次以后 我再也没去伦敦
I haven't been in London since...

570
00:25:20,571 --> 00:25:22,580
我应该当面告诉她
and I must tell her face to face.

571
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,022
是应该当面说的
Of course you must,

572
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:27,540
但我希望你是真的已经考虑好了
but I wish you'd think seriously before you do.

573
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,620
你的意思是想再拒绝我一次
You mean you're going to turn me down again.

574
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,657
我的意思是
I've told you

575
00:25:30,658 --> 00:25:33,540
我不是可以放下这一切的人 Tony
I'm not on the market, Tony.

576
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,580
我不自由
I'm not free.

577
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,620
有时候我也希望我可以 但我不行
Sometimes I almost wish I were, but I'm not.

578
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,520
现在就是这么个情况
And that's all there is to it.

579
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,337
噢 你真是好心
Oh, you have been incredibly kind

580
00:25:45,338 --> 00:25:47,460
谢谢你招待我们这么久
to put up with us for so long.

581
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,336
我们会想你的
We'll miss you.

582
00:25:48,337 --> 00:25:49,620
你们走了 房子都显得空了
The house will seem rather empty.

583
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,791
如果可以的话
If it were my choice,

584
00:25:50,792 --> 00:25:52,600
我真希望可以永远留在这
I should never be away from here.

585
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,182
我能问你一件事吗
Can I ask you one thing?

586
00:25:54,183 --> 00:25:56,440
你对你的那位仆人是什么看法
How do you feel about your man?

587
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,400
我还是不喜欢他 怎么了
I'm still not very keen on him. Why?

588
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,640
我们最好该启程了  所以 真的再见了
We'd better get started. So, this really is goodbye.

589
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,580
希望很快能再见到你
Not for long, I hope.

590
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,480
你把我想说的也给说了
You took the words right out of my mouth.

591
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,040
真遗憾他们走了
I'm sorry to see them go.

592
00:26:30,041 --> 00:26:31,600
你可比不上Mary遗憾
Not as sorry as Mary.

593
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,560
描述爱慕者们的名词都有什么
What's a group noun for suitors?

594
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,580
你说呢  渴望
What do you think? A desire?

595
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,440
爱慕者的渴望  挺好的
A desire of suitors. Very good.

596
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,998
如果你们再胡说八道的话
If you're going to talk nonsense,

597
00:26:41,999 --> 00:26:43,480
我就不理你们了
I have better things to do.

598
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,230
我已经把信寄出去了
I've posted the letter.

599
00:26:51,231 --> 00:26:52,480
那他也有可能会来
Well, he'll probably still come.

600
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,447
不管怎么样
He's got to be

601
00:26:53,448 --> 00:26:55,500
他还是要回约克郡参加葬礼的
in Yorkshire for the funeral, whatever you said.

602
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,480
她对谁说什么了
Whatever she said to who?

603
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,580
噢 就告诉我吧  我知道你藏着秘密
Oh, just tell me. I know you've got a secret,

604
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,239
如果你是为照顾我的心情才这样做
and if you're trying to spare my feelings

605
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,580
这不管用
it's not working.

606
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,520
Alfred写信来了
Alfred's written.

607
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:09,380
他父亲去世了 所以他要回来安排下葬的事
His father's died, so he's coming for the burial.

608
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,186
他想过来看看我们
He wants to look in and see us all.

609
00:27:11,187 --> 00:27:12,560
是看我们还是看她
See us all, or see her?

610
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,037
Alfred向我求婚了
Alfred's asked me to marry him.

611
00:27:16,038 --> 00:27:17,500
但是她拒绝了
But she's turned him down.

612
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,243
所以这次他的心是彻底碎了
So his heart's broken properly this time.

613
00:27:20,244 --> 00:27:21,500
这样你满意了
Are you satisfied now?

614
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,382
我们就不能不讨论这件事了吗
Why don't we leave the subject there?

615
00:27:23,383 --> 00:27:24,500
我们不想看你们闹翻
We don't want to fall out.

616
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,640
我们不会闹翻的 我们根本就没好过
We can't fall out, we've never fallen in!

617
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,600
所以他们是整整齐齐的离开了呗
So they got off in good order.

618
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,272
我怀疑到底还要多久
I wonder how long it'll take for them

619
00:27:36,273 --> 00:27:38,420
他们才能纷纷向Mary求婚
all to propose to Mary.

620
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,500
Gillingham勋爵不是订婚了吗
Isn't Lord Gillingham engaged?

621
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,423
是这样的 但看得出来
He's supposed to be,

622
00:27:42,424 --> 00:27:44,500
他还是对Mary很感兴趣
but he still seems as keen as mustard.

623
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,420
嗯 这挺有意思的
Well, that is very interesting.

624
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,560
但不是我叫你们来的原因
But it's not why I asked you here.

625
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,580
- 哦   - 不
- Oh? - No.

626
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,580
我是想知道你到底来唐顿干什么
I want to know what you were doing at Downton.

627
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,540
我不明白
I don't understand.

628
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,580
我为什么不能来唐顿  我是在这长大的
Why shouldn't I come to Downton? I grew up here.

629
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:06,520
看来我要循序渐进一些了
I see I'll have to take the slow path.

630
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:11,520
你打电话说Edith应该好好被照顾
You telephone to say Edith is to be cherished,

631
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:14,400
但你没说原因
but you don't say why.

632
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,440
- 没有吗   - 没有
- Didn't I? - No.

633
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:20,460
接着 你来唐顿拜访 然后在晚餐上说你要和
Next, you invite yourself to Downton and reveal at dinner

634
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,117
Edith要去欧洲大陆
that you and Edith are

635
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:25,540
待上几个月以便于
retreating to the continent for several months

636
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:29,460
- 你可以改善你的法语   - 是
- so you can improve your French. - Yes.

637
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,580
Rosamund对学法语不感兴趣
Rosamund has no interest in French.

638
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,953
如果她真的要别人听懂她在说什么
If she wishes to be understood by a foreigner,

639
00:28:36,954 --> 00:28:38,420
她会大吼大叫的
she shouts.

640
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,520
这么说可不公平
That's not fair.

641
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:44,440
都到这时候了 你们谁不该告诉我实情吗
Isn't it time one of you told me the truth?

642
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,956
如果我告诉你事实是什么
If I told you the truth,

643
00:28:50,957 --> 00:28:53,400
奶奶 我想你就再也不会和我说话了
Granny, you would never speak to me again.

644
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,420
我大概明白是什么情况了
Then you have told me the truth.

645
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:00,640
但我还是希望你们能说的详细些
But I would like to hear it enunciated more clearly.

646
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,420
好了 现在 我们必须打起精神来
Right. Now, we must all look lively.

647
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,420
今天主子们准备在集市上摆上摊位了
They're starting to set up the stalls for the bazaar today

648
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,500
这需要我们全部出动
and her ladyship will need all hands on deck.

649
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,446
James Molesley先生
James, Mr Molesley,

650
00:29:11,447 --> 00:29:12,580
你们可以也帮着干一些
if you could both keep an eye on things.

651
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,580
- 那我们能有额外的补贴吗   - 没有
- Do we get paid extra? - No,

652
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,087
但如果你干的好的话
but if you play your cards right,

653
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,620
你可以避免被训斥
you'll avoid a clip round the ear.

654
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,734
我要向Patmore女士
I'll ask Mrs Patmore

655
00:29:19,735 --> 00:29:21,480
要一些给村民们的茶点
for some refreshment for the village people.

656
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,002
你要知道 他们会在
This is an early warning that

657
00:29:23,003 --> 00:29:25,540
周六来摆上自己的摊位
they're coming to set up the stalls for Saturday,

658
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,440
所以我们现在最好开始准备三明治和啤酒
so we'd better have sandwiches and beer at the ready.

659
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:30,175
我所担心的是  Alfred要在
As I feared. Alfred's looking

660
00:29:30,176 --> 00:29:32,600
周六回伦敦
in on Saturday on his way back to London.

661
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,400
所以他有可能会赶上集市
So he'll be here for the bazaar.

662
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,420
他知道他和Ivy没戏了吧
He does know there's no hope with Ivy?

663
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,081
他就是因为这件事写信给我的
Well, that's why he's written to me.

664
00:29:43,082 --> 00:29:44,540
他说他还是想见她一面
But he says he wants to see her.

665
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,580
这对Daisy来说可不好过
It's not going to be very easy for Daisy.

666
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,450
我想给Daisy放一天假好了
I thought I'd give her the day off.

667
00:29:49,451 --> 00:29:50,400
你不介意吧
You won't mind, will you?

668
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,455
你拿主意吧
If you think it best.

669
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:54,560
反正你是那个要代替Daisy工作的人
It's you who'll do the extra work, not me.

670
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,460
真是的
What a nightmare.

671
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,460
卖冰的那个人病了 所以我要再去找个人
The man selling ices is ill so I've got to find another.

672
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,080
{\a6}==BTM字幕组出品==

673
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,506
来着伊辛沃尔德和莫尔顿的杂货商有仇
The grocers from Easingwold and Malton

674
00:30:02,507 --> 00:30:03,460
不能安排在一起
can't be side by side,

675
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,440
我还要和Patmore女士讨论今天的菜单
and I've got to decide the house menus with Mrs Patmore.

676
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,420
我来吧  集市的事
I'll do that. Tend to the bazaar.

677
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,400
- 你确定吗 因为你   - 我确定
- Are you sure? Because if you are... - I'm sure.

678
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,723
Robert表叔什么时候回来
When's Cousin Robert coming back?

679
00:30:15,724 --> 00:30:17,460
我不知道 我真希望能知道
I don't know. I wish I did.

680
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,400
我们已经好几天没他的消息了
We've had no word from him in days.

681
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,400
你怎么了
What is it?

682
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,580
我要去告诉大家 要不然我就要疯了
I've got to tell someone, or I'll just explode.

683
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:34,600
- 告诉谁什么   - 噢 Mary
- Tell someone what? - Oh, Mary.

684
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,640
你觉得呢
What do you think?

685
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,440
我订婚了
I'm engaged!

686
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,480
什么事这么着急
But what was so urgent?

687
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:46,620
第一 今天你能和我一起吃午餐吗
First, can you join me for luncheon today?

688
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,436
噢 行
Well, I suppose so.

689
00:30:47,437 --> 00:30:51,620
不过我要回去告诉Field女士一声 什么事
I ought to go back and tell Mrs Field. Why?

690
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,520
我邀请了Merton大人来
I've got Lord Merton coming.

691
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,480
Mary的教父吗
Mary's Godfather?

692
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,490
嗯 这是很久以前的事了
Mm. It was fixed years ago,

693
00:30:57,491 --> 00:30:59,480
Robert现在出远门了
but now Robert's off on his travels,

694
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:03,560
Cora太忙了  Mary有别的事
Cora is too busy... and Mary's chucked.

695
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,913
她干嘛去了
For what reason?

696
00:31:05,914 --> 00:31:08,480
她突然之间要去伦敦
Suddenly she has to be in London.

697
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,875
Rosamund不是还在这么
I think Rosamund's still here.

698
00:31:10,876 --> 00:31:12,500
噢 不 她可忍受不了他
Oh, no, she can't stand him.

699
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:15,540
我可以问问Edith  她应该有空
I could ask Edith. She might be free.

700
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,620
嗯 希望如此
Oh, I hope so.

701
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,560
我是Crawley家族可有可无的一份子
I'm a feeble substitute for the entire Crawley family.

702
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:22,620
嗯 是 但有你总比没有强
Mmm, yes, but you're better than nothing.

703
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,580
你这么说 我还是挺欣慰的
How warming you make that sound.

704
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,070
噢 太高兴你在这
Oh, I'm ever so glad to find you.

705
00:31:28,071 --> 00:31:29,580
你能帮我弄弄这个吗
Can you help me do these?

706
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,540
为什么这么着急
What's the rush?

707
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,620
Mary小姐要去伦敦
Lady Mary has to go to London.

708
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,440
- 为什么   - 我不知道
- Why? - I'm not sure.

709
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,520
- 但她想我和她一起去   - 当然了
- But she wants me to go with her. - Of course.

710
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,586
你什么时候能回来
When will you be back?

711
00:31:42,587 --> 00:31:44,420
明天晚上 或是再晚点
Tomorrow evening, but we'll be late.

712
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,400
这真不公平
It's not fair.

713
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,867
因为我你没能去纽约
I stop you going to New York

714
00:31:50,868 --> 00:31:52,460
结果现在我可以去伦敦了
and then I set off for London.

715
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,600
别傻了
Don't be silly.

716
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,500
进来
Come in.

717
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,355
Carson先生 我希望我明天
Mr Carson, I'd like to go

718
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:08,440
可以去约克  我希望你不介意
into York tomorrow. I hope you don't mind.

719
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,420
你在这又没事可做  我为什么会介意
You've got no duties here. Why should I mind?

720
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,380
如果你不反对 我一大早就出发
I'll set off first thing, if you've no objection.

721
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,600
请自便 Bates先生
Be my guest, Mr Bates.

722
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:18,620
我还是不知道你为什么不去纽约
I still don't understand why you're not in New York,

723
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,420
所以我又能对约克说什么呢
so I can hardly object to York.

724
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,520
玩的开心
Enjoy yourself.

725
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,480
很好 做的好 女士们
Very good. Well done, ladies.

726
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,440
- 我能试试吗   - 现在还不行
- Can I have a go? - It's not ready yet.

727
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,480
至少 你有点矮 不是吗
Anyway, you're a bit of a shrimp, aren't you?

728
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,640
我是矮 但我有肌肉
I'm a shrimp with muscles, me.

729
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,440
我们周六见分晓吧
We'll find that out on Saturday.

730
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,534
我一直不喜欢这些
I've never had a go on one of those.

731
00:32:54,535 --> 00:32:56,420
你不适合玩这些
It's not your sort of thing.

732
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,130
再来些三明治和啤酒
More sandwiches and more beer.

733
00:32:58,131 --> 00:32:59,580
就像是受蝗虫灾了似的
It's like a plague of locusts.

734
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,025
忙吗 Molesley先生
Busy, Mr Molesley?

735
00:33:01,026 --> 00:33:01,580
我喜欢集市
I like the bazaar.

736
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,580
我很享受这个  我希望你也能喜欢
I always enjoy it. I hope you will.

737
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,580
你能帮帮她吗 Molesley先生
Can't you help her too, Mr Molesley?

738
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,400
噢 离远点 你这厚脸皮的家伙
Oh, get off with you, you cheeky devil.

739
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,303
Alfred周六要来 是吗
Alfred's coming Saturday, in't he?

740
00:33:14,304 --> 00:33:15,540
你怎么知道的
How do you know that?

741
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,570
我听到你和Hughes女士的谈话了
I heard you and Mrs Hughes talking.

742
00:33:17,571 --> 00:33:19,580
噢 我 我正想 跟你说呢
Well I, I were going to mention it,

743
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,560
因为我觉得你最好避开他
because I wondered if you'd rather be away.

744
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,900
那工作怎么办
What about all the work?

745
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:25,580
噢 到时候也干的差不多了
Oh, it's mostly done by then.

746
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,580
如果你想避开他 我不介意的
If you'd rather avoid him, I won't mind.

747
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,540
我能去看看Mason先生吗
Could I go and see Mr Mason?

748
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,420
可以啊 这是个好主意
That's a good idea.

749
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,520
去多久都行  注意安全就好
Stay away as late as you like. Just to be safe.

750
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,480
为什么这么着急
But why the urgency?

751
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,424
我说不清楚
I can't explain,

752
00:33:41,425 --> 00:33:43,580
但如果你知道的话 你会明白的
but I swear if you knew, you'd approve.

753
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,805
怎么了 发生了什么
What this? What's happened?

754
00:33:45,806 --> 00:33:47,380
Mary要去伦敦
Mary has to go to London.

755
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,460
没什么事  我明晚就回来
It's no big thing. I'll be back tomorrow night.

756
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,580
- 我能一起去吗   - 不行
- Can I come? - No.

757
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,750
为什么
Well, why not?

758
00:33:51,751 --> 00:33:53,620
因为妈妈需要你在这帮她
Because Mama needs you here.

759
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,640
再见  再见 Rose
Goodbye, then. Bye, Rose.

760
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,490
你想在我那住一宿吗
Do you want to stay at the house?

761
00:33:57,491 --> 00:33:58,580
我可以打电话安排一下
I'll telephone if you do.

762
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,420
行吗  谢谢你
Could you? You're an angel.

763
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,620
我让Mead去他斯温登的姐姐那
I told Mead he could visit his sister in Swindon,

764
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,754
他们尽可能的安排好的
but they'll do the best they can.

765
00:34:04,755 --> 00:34:05,600
谢谢你了
Thank you.

766
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,400
真神秘
How mysterious.

767
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,580
出什么问题了吗
Is anything wrong?

768
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,480
车子不转了 我朋友去找人求救了
The car's packed in, my friend's gone for help.

769
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,970
我帮你看看吧
Would you like me to have a look?

770
00:34:32,971 --> 00:34:34,440
我不想耽误你的时间
I don't want to hold you up.

771
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:36,560
我也没事  我是去斯基普顿见
I've no appointment. I was on my way to Skipton

772
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:39,560
供应商比较价格的
to see some suppliers and compare prices.

773
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,460
挺不错的
How impressive.

774
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,042
我以为
I thought that

775
00:34:42,043 --> 00:34:45,420
当代理人成为有钱人的表亲或是女婿的话
when the agent was a cousin or son-in-law,

776
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,640
他就不用再为生活奔波了 反正有别人干
he had free shooting for life, but others did the work.

777
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,520
引用我老婆的奶奶的话
To quote my wife's grandmother,

778
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:53,380
你一定是读过有关社会主义的报纸的
you've been reading Socialist newspapers again.

779
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,560
你说对了
You should know.

780
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,440
这样好吗
Is this wise?

781
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,560
你可能听过有关于我的故事 但只是一部分
You've heard some of my story, but not all of it.

782
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,620
我以前是在唐顿做司机的
I came to Downton to be the chauffeur.

783
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,640
现在
Now...

784
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,620
可口的午饭
That was a splendid luncheon.

785
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,295
这让我大开眼界了
Quite a change for me.

786
00:35:16,296 --> 00:35:17,600
噢 我才不相信呢
Oh, I can't believe that.

787
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:20,480
是真的  我吃的简直是病号饭
It's true. I eat nothing but nursery food.

788
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,878
也许你需要一个新的厨师
Perhaps you need a new cook.

789
00:35:22,879 --> 00:35:23,620
这不是厨师的错
It's not her fault.

790
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,500
是我不知道该点些什么
I never know what to order.

791
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,460
人们经常对男人说 你要比老婆先死
A husband is told so often he's going to die first,

792
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,460
否则你是不知道要怎么独自一人生活下去的
you never think you're going to have to manage on your own.

793
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,690
我想Crawley医生还在的话
I doubt Doctor Crawley

794
00:35:33,691 --> 00:35:34,520
他会做的很好
would have managed any better.

795
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,460
我真惊讶他是个医生
I'm so interested he was a doctor.

796
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,840
我曾想自学医术
I wanted to study medicine myself,

797
00:35:37,841 --> 00:35:39,540
但是我父亲真的不认为
but my father didn't really...

798
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:43,420
不认为这是个绅士的职位
Didn't see it as a profession for a gentleman.

799
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,540
我想他也不至于这么说
I don't believe he'd have gone that far.

800
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,640
但他是确实不认为这是个适合贵族的职位
But he didn't think it quite suitable for a peer, no.

801
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,520
我应该试着举个例子反驳他
I must try and find an example to rebut that.

802
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,520
我该走了
Well, I must be going.

803
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,580
我送你吧 我的车子就停在外面
Let me take you. My car's outside.

804
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,440
我走回去就行
I can easily walk.

805
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,480
请让我载您一程
I'd like to. Please.

806
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,540
那么谢谢了
Then...thank you.

807
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,460
我也得走了
I should go too, Granny.

808
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,460
别走
No. Stay.

809
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,440
我有话想对你说
I want to speak to you.

810
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:19,440
你结婚的时候还是个司机吗
So were you still the chauffeur when you married?

811
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,580
说来话长
That's a long story.

812
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,540
你的事都是说来话长
Everything with you's a long story.

813
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,560
这个故事有个美好的结局
That one had a happy ending.

814
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,640
至少有段时间是
For a time, anyway.

815
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,440
我知道她死了
I know she died.

816
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:39,420
很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

817
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,520
她一定是一个不平常而又独立的人
She must have been a very unusual and independent person.

818
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,620
你说得对
You could say that again.

819
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,887
他们让你留下来
It's nice that they asked you to stay,

820
00:36:48,888 --> 00:36:50,560
在这里谋生是件好事
to make your life here.

821
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,440
我有一个小女儿 这看上去是件正确的事
I have a little daughter, and it seemed the right thing.

822
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,460
这让我对这家人的看法更温和了
Still, it makes me take a kinder view of the family.

823
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,420
你以前对这家人有什么不满意吗
Oh? What do you have against them?

824
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,540
什么都没有
Nothing.

825
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:07,540
但是 照例 我对他们这类人没什么好感
But, as a rule, I don't really warm to their type.

826
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,580
我不相信人的阶级
I don't believe in types.

827
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,640
我相信人本身
I believe in people.

828
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,400
现在来试试
Now give it a try.

829
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:28,400
真的很谢谢你  谢谢
I really am very grateful. Thank you.

830
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,540
我不怎么说这个
I don't often say it,

831
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,620
但是Rosamund是对的
but Rosamund is right.

832
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,640
我不知道Drewe先生
I do not know this Mr...Mr Drewe,...

833
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,440
即使他是你说的那样
..But even if he is everything you say,

834
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,540
让孩子留在这
to keep the child here

835
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,446
会像离你脑袋很近的
would be like a permanent

836
00:38:01,447 --> 00:38:04,540
达摩克利斯之剑一样
sword of Damocles, inches from your head.

837
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,400
我无法忍受把他送走的想法
But I can't bear the thought of giving it away.

838
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,600
让他在瑞士长大对不对
And is it right that it should grow up Swiss?

839
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:15,440
瑞士可以提供一切
Well, Switzerland has everything to offer,...

840
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,500
除了日常对话少了点
..Except perhaps conversation.

841
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:21,440
但至少缺了也不影响
And one can learn to live without that.

842
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,580
如果Michael出现了呢
And if Michael turns up?

843
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:27,460
我的建议就是 和他重新开始
Well, if you want my advice, start again.

844
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,580
我会负担一切
Now, I will pay for everything.

845
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,440
Rosamund姨母说她会负担一切
Aunt Rosamund said she would.

846
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:35,460
事实上你会无法忍受
You'll be quite enough in her debt as it is.

847
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,460
欠她哪怕一分钱
Take any more,

848
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:41,420
她会开始收严苛的年贡
and she'll start exacting annual tribute.

849
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,460
你的儿子们做什么  我认为他们是有工作的
What do your sons do? I assume they do something.

850
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,420
记得我在晚宴时遇到Larry吗
Remember I met Larry at that dinner?

851
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,400
别提醒我了
Ah, don't remind me.

852
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,460
他们是有工作
They do work.

853
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,540
Larry是银行职员Tim是外交官
Larry's in banking and Tim's in the diplomatic,

854
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,520
没什么令人吃惊的  那你的儿子呢
so nothing very startling there. What about yours?

855
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:01,420
Matthew是个律师
Matthew was a lawyer.

856
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,600
他辞职了吗
Oh, has he given it up?

857
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,520
他
He's...

858
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,460
他死了
He's dead.

859
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,540
我以为你知道
I thought you would know that.

860
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,560
天呐
Oh, good God.

861
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,470
真的非常抱歉
I'm terribly sorry.

862
00:39:15,471 --> 00:39:17,380
我刚才忘了你是谁
I... I'd forgotten for a moment who you were.

863
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,520
请不要担心
Don't worry. Please.

864
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,460
Mary呢  我以为我今天可以见到她
How is Mary? I do wish I could have seen her today.

865
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,929
虽然慢了些
Well, slow to start with,

866
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:28,480
但是我很高兴 她走上了正轨
but now she's on her way, which I'm glad of.

867
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,580
- 我听说他们很合适   - 是的
- I heard they were well suited.   - Yes.

868
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:34,420
他们曾经很幸福 这让分离变得更糟糕
They were happy, which makes the parting worse,

869
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,600
但这样的爱情 最终都会带给人力量
but gives you strength in the end, as we know.

870
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,560
那是你  但不是我
You maybe. Not me.

871
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,500
Mearton女士和我不是刻意要在一起
Lady Merton and I were not exactly meant to be together.

872
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:52,420
那时候 我们像其他人那样挣扎着活着
We struggled on, of course, as everyone did in those days,

873
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,480
但是我现在不确定它是否明智
but I'm not sure now how sensible it was.

874
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:59,101
我嫉妒你 你美好的记忆
I envy you, your wonderful memories,

875
00:39:59,102 --> 00:40:01,520
但是我不能觊觎它们
but I can't pretend to match them.

876
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,600
Ross先生还在这么
Is Mr Ross here yet?

877
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:24,460
- 请问您是谁   - Rose的表姐
- Who shall I say is calling?    - Rose's cousin.

878
00:40:42,525 --> 00:40:46,460
Mary女士
Lady Mary.Huh.

879
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,580
我还在想是不是你
I was wondering if it would be you.

880
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,540
你怎么知道会有人来找你
How did you know someone was coming?

881
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,540
Rose打过电话
Rose telephoned.

882
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,560
她说她告诉了你我们准备确定日期
She said she'd told you we were about to set the date.

883
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,620
我煮了茶  你要来一杯么
I just made some tea. Would you like a cup?

884
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,400
谢谢
Thank you.

885
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,420
我猜你来是想说弗林特郡的老爷
I suppose you're here to say that Lord Flintshire

886
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:09,540
发现他有个黑人女婿很荒谬
would find the prospect of a black son-in-law preposterous.

887
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,520
您父亲会很赞同
And your father would agree.

888
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:14,600
说句实在话 比起忍受你的肤色
To be fair to Papa, he'd find your being a band singer

889
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:17,460
他更难接受你是一个乐队歌手的事实
even harder to swallow than your colour.

890
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:24,560
Ross先生 你确定吗
Mr Ross, are you sure about this?

891
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:29,460
婚姻是一项挑战 即使每个人都想要它
Marriage is a challenge, even when everyone wants it.

892
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,580
即使每个人都祈祷你能幸福
Even if everyone prays you'll be happy.

893
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,648
你的意思是在我们这件事上
You mean in our case,

894
00:41:34,649 --> 00:41:36,540
他们一直在努力地拆散我们
they'll all be trying to pull us apart.

895
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,400
每时每刻
Every hour of every day.

896
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,440
告诉我 你觉得她爱你吗
Tell me, do you think she loves you?

897
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,420
你不相信我们吗
Don't you believe in us?

898
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,560
我相信你  但是我不确定她的感情
I believe in you. I'm not so sure about her.

899
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:03,420
她可能有点爱你 但是我想说
She may love you a bit, but mostly I'd say

900
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,600
她想刺激她的母亲  她恨她
she wants to shock her mother, whom incidentally, she hates.

901
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,560
我的母亲也这么说
That's what my mother said.

902
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:13,600
她说Rose肯定是想证明什么
She said Rose must be proving some point.

903
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,640
你跟我的母亲有不少共同点
You and my mother have a lot in common.

904
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,892
诚实地告诉我 你觉得
Tell me honestly: Do you

905
00:42:20,893 --> 00:42:23,540
你能挺过他们将对你做的一切吗
think you can survive what they'll do to you?

906
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:26,540
因为我觉得Rose做不到
Because I don't believe Rose could.

907
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:29,580
也许你听到这个会安心
It may come as something of a relief for you to hear that

908
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,420
我不会跟Rose结婚
I will not be marrying Rose.

909
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:35,440
- 你不和她结婚   - 是的
- You won't?   - No.

910
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,540
我曾经分享过她的梦想
I've enjoyed her dreams.

911
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,520
我想她要比你认为的坚强
I think she's more than you allow.

912
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,500
但是
But?

913
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,440
我不想毁了她的生活
I don't want to spoil her life.

914
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:50,560
我不想让她被人们指指点点和嘲笑
I don't want to watch while people point at her and jeer.

915
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,600
我爱她
I love her.

916
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,600
我希望她幸福
I want her to be happy.

917
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,420
所以你要结束这一切吗
So you'll end it?

918
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,580
是的
Yes.

919
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,800
我本应该早点终止这一切
I should probably have stopped it sooner,

920
00:43:04,801 --> 00:43:05,600
但至少
but at any rate,...

921
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,420
我现在终止了
..I'm stopping it now.

922
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,374
你会告诉Rose吗 还是我去说
So will you tell Rose, or shall I?

923
00:43:13,375 --> 00:43:14,500
我会告诉他的
I'll tell her.

924
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,640
我会给她写封信
I'll write to her.

925
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,580
她明天会收到
She'll get it tomorrow.

926
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,560
但并不意味着我认为这是正确的
It doesn't mean I think it's right.

927
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:27,697
如果我们生活在更美好的世界里
I wouldn't give in if we lived in even

928
00:43:27,698 --> 00:43:28,560
我绝不会放弃
a slightly better world.

929
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,500
您可能会惊讶 Ross先生
It may surprise you, Mr Ross,

930
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,288
如果我们生活在更美好的世界里
but if we lived in a better world,

931
00:43:36,289 --> 00:43:37,580
我也不愿您放弃
I wouldn't want you to.

932
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,845
夫人 我刚才在楼下
I've been downstairs, m'lady.

933
00:44:02,846 --> 00:44:04,500
他们正在给您做晚饭
They're making dinner for you now.

934
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,640
- 我不想吃太多   - 我告诉他们了
- I don't want a lot.   - I've told them that.

935
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,640
你怎么样了
How are you?

936
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,520
跟昨天差不多
Much as I was yesterday.

937
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:16,420
跟明天也差不多
Much as I will be tomorrow.

938
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,500
Anna
Anna,

939
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:21,540
我准备去见Gillingham爵士
I've decided to see Lord Gillingham.

940
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:24,500
很抱歉 但我不能无所作为
I'm sorry, but I must do something.

941
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:27,380
我会打电话告诉他我们在午宴时见面
I'll telephone and suggest we meet for luncheon.

942
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,560
我会让他直接解雇他的仆人
Then I'll ask him straight out to dismiss his valet.

943
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:31,460
我不会说理由
I won't say why.

944
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,460
- 这让我好不安   - 不要不安
- That makes me so nervous.   - Don't be.

945
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:37,540
不会有人知道原因
No-one needs to know the reason.

946
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:40,580
Green就不用再回到唐顿了
Green simply won't be back at Downton again.

947
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,640
Bates会怀疑Gillingham爵士
Is Bates going to challenge Lord Gillingham

948
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,560
为什么会换男仆吗
as to why he has a different valet?

949
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,500
我觉得不会
I suppose not.

950
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,440
所以你不用害怕他来访
So you have nothing to fear if he pays us a visit.

951
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,440
他会吗 夫人
And will he, m'lady?

952
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,440
晚餐好了 夫人
Er, dinner's on the table, m'lady.

953
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:59,488
我不确定Mead会这么做
I'm not sure Mead would have put it like that,

954
00:44:59,489 --> 00:45:00,580
不过还是谢谢了
but thank you.

955
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,080
{\a6}==BTM字幕组出品==

956
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:21,420
今天我们装饰了摊位 你们也清楚程序
So, we decorate the stalls today. You all know the drill.

957
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,420
记着
And remember,

958
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,500
所有不完美都会让唐顿面上无光
anything shabby shows Downton in a bad light.

959
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,811
我们不能让这发生
And we can't have that.

960
00:45:27,812 --> 00:45:29,640
对 Hughes夫人 我们不能
No, Mrs Hughes, we can't.

961
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,560
你会来吗
Will you come?

962
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:34,637
这是个让你
It'll give you a chance

963
00:45:34,638 --> 00:45:36,540
见识村庄的人的机会
to meet a few people from the village.

964
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:39,400
- 他们不都是些工人吗   - 不 不是
- Is it not just the estate workers?   - Oh, no, no.

965
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:41,520
地点在教堂义卖市场的后面
The whole area gets behind the Church bazaar.

966
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:44,580
你要知道你是很幸运的
You're very lucky, you know.

967
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,500
从没有人这么说我 尤其是我自己
Nobody's ever called me that. Least of all myself.

968
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,500
在你一个人们都认识你喜欢你的村庄长大
To grow up in a village where people know and like you,

969
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,646
你的家族受到尊重
where your family's respected.

970
00:45:54,647 --> 00:45:56,560
人们都会欣赏这一点
Plenty would give an eye for that.

971
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,540
我不习惯觉得幸运
I'm not used to feeling lucky.

972
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,400
你应该觉得
Well, you should be.

973
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,460
我们在做色彩搭配吗
Are we trying for a colour scheme?

974
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,580
天呐 我一定会是第一个累倒的
Goodness, I thought I'd be down before anyone.

975
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:18,380
不  这项任务应该早点开始
Oh, no. This is one task that demands an early start.

976
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,502
帐篷里在准备茶
The tent's up for the tea.

977
00:46:19,503 --> 00:46:21,580
他们正从仓库里搬桌椅
They're fetching tables and chairs from the barn.

978
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:24,560
不要让他们在接人回来时糟蹋了草地
Don't let them mess up the grass when they drive them back.

979
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:27,640
Rose   一 二 三 抬
Rose! One, two, three, lift.

980
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,620
我可以的
Oh! I can manage.

981
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:35,420
Rose  你应该这么做吗
Rose... Should you be doing this?

982
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,952
为什么  你有什么好担心的
Why? What are you afraid of?

983
00:46:37,953 --> 00:46:39,460
怕我会失去这孩子吗
That I'll lose the baby?

984
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,500
看来他们没少让你卖力干活啊
So they've made you a beast of burden now?

985
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,480
是的
That's right.

986
00:46:44,481 --> 00:46:46,400
他们这不是在占你的便宜吗
And they're not taking advantage?

987
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,580
他们准备好了吗  这些给我  James
Are they ready for these? Give me those. James!

988
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,420
能请您把这个带去帐篷吗
Could you take these to the tent, please?

989
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,420
我来介绍一下Bunting女士
May I present Miss Bunting?

990
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,000
她在村庄的学校教书
She teaches at the village school.

991
00:46:59,001 --> 00:47:00,560
我对学校很感兴趣
I'm very interested in the school.

992
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:03,560
你知道Grantham女士吗
You know Lady Grantham?

993
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,420
当然  很高兴见到您
Of course. It's nice to meet you,

994
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,440
但是我恐怕要上车了
but I'm afraid I must get on.

995
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:16,380
她是Grantham伯爵夫人吗
So that's the great Countess of Grantham.

996
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,400
是的  也是一个卖力干活的人
It is. Another beast of burden.

997
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:29,105
如果你坚持 那么我会解雇他
I'll sack him if you insist,

998
00:47:29,106 --> 00:47:30,560
但是告诉我原因  这才公平
but tell me why. It's only fair.

999
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:33,480
不管这公不公平 但是我不能说
I don't know if it's fair or unfair, but I can't.

1000
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:34,594
一点提示都没有吗
Not even a hint?

1001
00:47:34,595 --> 00:47:35,520
如果我能说我会说的
I've said what I can.

1002
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:41,560
他做了些你会觉得可恶的事
He's done something you'd find...abhorrent.

1003
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,440
好吧 你赢了
Well, you win.

1004
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,520
虽然我不喜欢他 不过这样还是有些卑鄙
But it does seem mean, even if I don't like him very much.

1005
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:53,460
如果你知道真相就不会觉得卑鄙了
You wouldn't think it mean if you knew the truth.

1006
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,520
好吧 我相信你
Well, I believe you.

1007
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,640
我爱你 我也相信你
I love you and I believe you.

1008
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,440
你跟Mabel说了吗
Have you spoken to Mabel?

1009
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,620
说了 但我没提那事
I have. But I wasn't going to bring it up.

1010
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:09,420
- 为什么   - 我不想说服你
- Why not?   - I don't want to twist your arm.

1011
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,300
我知道除非合你胃口
And I know that you won't make a decision

1012
00:48:11,301 --> 00:48:12,540
你才会做决定
until it suits you.

1013
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:15,540
- 她怎么想   - 我很高兴你问了
- How did she take it?   - I'm so pleased you asked.

1014
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:17,560
我想她的答复一定会很有风度
I think the answer is with real style.

1015
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:20,520
我很高兴
Well, I'm glad.

1016
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,620
现在可以结账了吗  我恐怕要迟到了
And now, can you get the bill? I'm terribly late.

1017
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,902
我必须赶上最后一班车
I must catch the last train.

1018
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,600
明天就是教堂义卖了
It's the Church bazaar tomorrow.

1019
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,460
我不会放弃的 Mary
I won't give up, Mary.

1020
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:34,540
哪怕你和另一个男人走进礼堂
Not until you walk down the aisle with another man,

1021
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:37,480
很可能那样我也不放弃
and very possibly not even then.

1022
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:42,500
这话让我既闹心又开心啊
I find that both irritating and beguiling in equal measure.

1023
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:46,383
我应该觉得欣慰吗
Should I take comfort from that?

1024
00:48:46,384 --> 00:48:47,440
随你怎么想
Take what you like.

1025
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:49,460
我走了
I'm going.

1026
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,520
处理一下Green的事
And do what I ask with Green,...

1027
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:03,400
请你完成之后告诉我
..And please let me know when you've done it.

1028
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:15,900
你送给我的吗
You sent for me?

1029
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,880
我不会这么做
I wouldn't put it like that.

1030
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:20,780
我还在想你是否有空
I just wondered if you might be free.

1031
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,680
悉听尊意
Oh. Your wish is my command.

1032
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:26,042
今天早上Merton爵爷
These came this morning from

1033
00:49:26,043 --> 00:49:27,800
送来这些花表示感谢
Lord Merton. As a thank you.

1034
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:30,820
他一贯如此  那我又算什么呢
That was kind of him. But what part do I play in it?

1035
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:33,860
这是给你的
They're for you.

1036
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:36,800
给我的  肯定不是
For me? Surely not.

1037
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:40,940
是给你的 他也送我一些 这是一起送来的
Yes, he sent me some too, these came with them.

1038
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:43,860
我看了卡片
I read the card.

1039
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:48,700
他为他的不得体请求原谅
He asks forgiveness for his tactlessness.

1040
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:52,860
他不得体了吗  他不是故意的
Was he tactless? He didn't mean to be tactless.

1041
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:56,820
- 多好看   - 是的
- How nice.   - Mmm.

1042
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:59,780
非常好看
Very nice.

1043
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:03,940
非常意外 但是非常好看
Quite...quite surprising, but very nice.

1044
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:09,920
我正要去看看他们还需要什么
I'm just going up to see if they need anything more.

1045
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:12,740
能让门童擦一下鞋子吗
Can you leave these for one of the hall boys?

1046
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,860
Carson先生 我来做  我不介意
I'll do them, Mr Carson. I don't mind.

1047
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:17,740
你在约克郡待过吗
You took your time in York.

1048
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,700
是的 那是段漫长的日子
Yes, it was quite a long day.

1049
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:27,820
- 你做些什么   - 很多事
- What were you up to?   - Oh, this and that.

1050
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:33,820
一 二 三 出发
One, two, three, go!

1051
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:48,940
很高兴再见到你  非常感谢
Lovely to see you again. Thank you very much.

1052
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:05,800
你收到他的信了吗
You got his letter, then?

1053
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:07,740
你真令我失望 Mary
You're so disappointing, Mary.

1054
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:11,860
我以为你明白我 结果你和我妈一个样
I thought you understood, and you're just like my mother.

1055
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:15,880
不 我不像  但是我明白
No, I'm not. But I understand this -

1056
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:18,170
如果你想让你的生活变得复杂
if you're going to complicate your life,

1057
00:51:18,171 --> 00:51:19,760
至少要为个正当的理由
do it for the right reasons.

1058
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:24,780
Jeames 我把茶帐篷交给你管
James, I'm putting the tea tent in your charge.

1059
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,760
确保茶不会被喝完
Make sure they don't run out of anything.

1060
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:30,700
但是夫人让我们好好玩
But her ladyship said we were to enjoy ourselves.

1061
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:31,880
我们来分析一下
Let us consider this.

1062
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:34,000
她希望你能玩得愉快
She wants you to enjoy yourself,

1063
00:51:34,001 --> 00:51:35,680
我希望你管好帐篷
I want you to run the tent.

1064
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:37,860
我们谁可以让你的生活更不便呢
Now, which of us can make your life more uncomfortable?

1065
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:43,820
Molesley先生
Mr Molesley.

1066
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:46,740
Molesley先生  Molesley先生
Mr Molesley! Mr Molesley!

1067
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:49,720
告诉那些人应该把车停哪儿
Tell those people where they're supposed to park.

1068
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:52,720
稍等一下  那是老爷  老爷回来了
Wait a minute. It's his lordship! His lordship's back!

1069
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:54,820
告诉别人 老爷回来了
Tell the others! His lordship's back!

1070
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:55,900
James
James!

1071
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:04,760
你怎么回来了
How can you be here?!

1072
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:06,700
也不说给人打个招呼
Why didn't you send a message?

1073
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,880
万一我们手忙脚乱的  你真是过分啊
We would have made such a fuss! You're a beast!

1074
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:10,840
我希望没有太过分
Oh, not quite a beast, I hope.

1075
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:12,920
我只是想给你们个惊喜 现在做到了
I wanted to surprise you and I think I have.

1076
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:14,846
爸爸 你该提前告诉我们的
Papa, you should have let us know!

1077
00:52:14,847 --> 00:52:15,800
你什么时候到的
When did you get in?

1078
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:17,880
今天早上  我都忘记有义卖了
This morning. I'd forgotten about the bazaar.

1079
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:20,840
没有打扰你们劳动真是明智之举
I was right not to distract you all from your labours.

1080
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:24,086
Harold叔叔的事怎样了
What happened to Uncle Harold?

1081
00:52:24,087 --> 00:52:25,700
他只受了顿训斥
A reprimand, but nothing more.

1082
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:26,880
看来你没有白白赶过去
So it was worth your going.

1083
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:29,032
我觉得我没起到什么作用
I don't think I made a bit of difference,

1084
00:52:29,033 --> 00:52:30,800
但就让他们认为我起到了吧
but let's hold on to that fiction.

1085
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:32,940
- 纽约怎么样   - 很有趣
- How was it?  - Interesting.

1086
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:36,920
很现代 很有趣
Very modern...and very interesting.

1087
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:39,760
家里怎么样
How's it been here?

1088
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:41,820
不大有趣也不大现代
Not very interesting and not very modern.

1089
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:44,865
Carson 你好 Bates
Carson. Hello, Bates.

1090
00:52:44,866 --> 00:52:45,760
有没有挂念我啊
Have you missed me?

1091
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:48,760
我倒是蛮挂念你们
Because I've certainly missed you.

1092
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:50,780
很高兴您回家 老爷
Good to see you back, m'lord.

1093
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:54,900
你回来了
You're back.

1094
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,900
真不敢相信
I can't believe it.

1095
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,940
我梦想这一刻多时了
If you knew how many times I'd imagined this scene.

1096
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:11,700
这是个小慰劳  咱们有段时间没见了
This is a treat. It's been a while.

1097
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:14,800
我很抱歉一直没来看你
I'm sorry if I've stayed away.

1098
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:17,840
别抱歉 你不该道歉 别在这里
Nay, no apologies. Not from you. Not here.

1099
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:19,880
你是我的儿媳妇
You're my daughter-in-law,

1100
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:22,860
是我儿子为我留下的唯一的亲人
you're all that I've got left of my son.

1101
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:26,720
不论你回不回来 这儿都是你的家
Whether you come here or not, this is your home.

1102
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:28,820
我每次回来都很高兴
I do love it when I come.

1103
00:53:28,821 --> 00:53:29,860
那么我也高兴
I'm glad.

1104
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:32,800
这就是了
That's it.

1105
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:35,409
你在这儿啊 Alfred
Oh, there you are, Alfred.

1106
00:53:35,410 --> 00:53:37,800
很高兴见到你 喝杯饮料吧
Nice to see you. Have a glass of this.

1107
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:40,820
- Ivy在吗  - 我在这儿呢
- Is Ivy about?  - I'm just here.

1108
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:46,700
谢谢
Thank you.

1109
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:53,680
- 葬礼怎么样   - 办的不错
- How was the funeral?  - Was well attended.

1110
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:56,760
对我妈也算是个宽慰了
So that's something for my mother to hold on to.

1111
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:58,860
我读了你的信
I read your letter.

1112
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:02,880
如果伤害了你的感情 那我很抱歉
I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.

1113
00:54:02,881 --> 00:54:03,720
该道歉的是我
No, I'm sorry.

1114
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,860
我上次过来的时候误会了你的意思
I got the wrong end of the stick when I were last up here,

1115
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,740
但这是我的错
but it were my mistake.

1116
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:11,700
你的本意 只是想尽量友好的欢迎我
All you did was...try and give me a nice welcome,

1117
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:13,740
所以你不该抱歉
and you can't feel sorry for that.

1118
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:14,920
你我能以朋友身份道别吗
We can part as friends?

1119
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:17,820
当然可以 我可以做到
We can, as far as I'm concerned.

1120
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:23,840
Daisy在吗
Is Daisy here?

1121
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:26,524
我想知道
I wanted to see if she

1122
00:54:26,525 --> 00:54:29,700
我和她能不能继续是朋友
and I could be friends an' all before I go.

1123
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:31,920
她今天去Mason家的农庄了
She's gone to Mr Mason's farm for the day.

1124
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:34,740
直到晚上才能回来
She won't be back till late.

1125
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:43,760
Daisy你今天来是为了避开Alfred吗
Daisy, are you here to avoid seeing Alfred?

1126
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:45,537
Ivy又拒绝了他
Ivy's turned him down again,

1127
00:54:45,538 --> 00:54:47,880
所以他以后应该不会回来了
so he won't come back after today.

1128
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:50,760
Patmore太太对此怎么说
What does Mrs Patmore say about it?

1129
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:52,820
让我避开他 所以我就这么做了
To stay away so I don't meet him.

1130
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:56,780
- 我觉得这个想法不对   - 为什么
- I would advise against that.  - But why?

1131
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,880
我在这里多待一会你难道不高兴吗
I thought you'd be glad if I stayed a bit longer.

1132
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:00,547
我自然是希望你不会离开
I wish you'd stay and never leave,

1133
00:55:00,548 --> 00:55:01,920
我希望有朝一日会这样
and I hope you will one day,

1134
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:04,760
但Patmore太太错了
but Mrs Patmore's wrong.

1135
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:08,866
Daisy 你一生中
Daisy, there won't be

1136
00:55:08,867 --> 00:55:10,780
爱上的人不会有很多
too many people that you love in your life,

1137
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,760
而他是其中之一
and he's one.

1138
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:15,720
我不知道现在我是怎么想他的
I don't know what I feel about him. Not now.

1139
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:19,680
即使这样 你也要去和这个年轻人道个别
Even so, you need to say goodbye to this young man,

1140
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:21,680
在你们两之间
with nothing jagged,

1141
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:23,880
不要心存遗憾和怨恨
nothing harsh, between you.

1142
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:26,800
我不知道该说什么
I couldn't think of the words.

1143
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:28,860
到时候就知道了
We'll find them together.

1144
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:33,880
我会及时把你送回唐顿
And er, we'll get you back to Downton in time.

1145
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:37,760
你在默默忍受吧
Are you bearing up?

1146
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:39,800
坐这里
In here.

1147
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:41,920
我再也见不到Michael了 是不是
I'm never going to see Michael again, am I?

1148
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:45,206
如果你想去那里找他
If you want to go out there and look for him,

1149
00:55:45,207 --> 00:55:46,840
我会支持你
I'll support you.

1150
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:48,940
别人已经找过了
They've already done all that.

1151
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:51,840
警察 私人侦探 能出动的都出动了
Police and private detectives and everything.

1152
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:53,940
那么你必须耐心
Well, then you must be patient.

1153
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:57,760
有时我觉得上帝不愿我幸福
Sometimes I feel that God doesn't want me to be happy.

1154
00:55:57,780 --> 00:55:59,920
亲爱的 所有生命都是由麻烦组成的
My dear, all life is a series of problems

1155
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:02,720
我们必须努力解决
which we must try and solve.

1156
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:05,860
一个一个的解决
First one, then the next, and the next,...

1157
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:08,940
直到我们死亡
..Until at last we die.

1158
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:15,840
不如你给咱拿点冰淇淋吧
Why don't you get us an ice cream?

1159
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:18,900
对啊 吃点冰一切就解决了
Yes. That should sort it out.

1160
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:34,392
那不是Gillingham大人吗
Isn't that Lord Gillingham?

1161
00:56:34,393 --> 00:56:35,840
怎么 不会吧 他在哪
What? It can't be. Where?

1162
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:41,097
Lane Fox小姐会怎么想啊
What does Miss Lane Fox think about it?

1163
00:56:41,098 --> 00:56:41,880
我也很好奇
That's what I wonder.

1164
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:42,712
我同意
I agree.

1165
00:56:42,713 --> 00:56:45,760
他是我知道的最不靠谱的未婚夫了
He's the most unconvincing fiance I've ever come across.

1166
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:47,840
她可能不知道
Perhaps she doesn't know.

1167
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:50,940
咱们知道她就知道  这点我很确定
If we know, she knows. You can count on that.

1168
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:55,880
Green怎么会死了呢
Green. But how could he be dead?

1169
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:58,720
我也从别人那里听说的
I'm only telling you what they told me.

1170
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:00,880
他当时在皮卡迪利大街
That he was in Piccadilly and he...

1171
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:01,880
{\a6}伦敦的繁华街道

1172
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:04,880
然后他滑倒在马路上
slipped or stumbled and fell into the road.

1173
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:06,940
我不知该说什么
I don't know what to say.

1174
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:09,946
咱们昨天刚说完那样的话就出事了
It just seemed so odd after

1175
00:57:09,947 --> 00:57:10,920
我觉得很奇怪
our conversation yesterday

1176
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:13,860
我觉得我应该亲自告诉你
that I felt that I should... bring you the news myself.

1177
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:20,900
现在你能告诉我你想让他走人的原因了吗
Can you explain to me now why you wanted him sacked?

1178
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,940
不能
No.

1179
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:25,680
你好Tony 天哪
Hello, Tony. Heavens,

1180
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:27,880
今天的集会变得多热闹了啊
what a gathering of the clans today's turning out to be.

1181
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:29,800
我先离开片刻
Would you excuse me for a moment?

1182
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:32,424
我猜你回到唐顿
I don't suppose it's a good sign

1183
00:57:32,425 --> 00:57:34,820
是因为出了些不好的事吧
to find you back at Downton?

1184
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:37,800
确实  发生了点事
Not really. Not this time.

1185
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:46,360
你是说他跌倒在路上 然后被车撞了 在昨天
You mean he fell into the road and he was hit? Yesterday?

1186
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:48,460
不是汽车就是卡车
By a bus or lorry, apparently.

1187
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,520
有人看到吗
And someone saw this?

1188
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:55,500
人行道上都挤满了  很多人都目睹了
The pavement was crowded. Lots of people saw it.

1189
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:02,340
- 这也算是个解脱   - 为何这么说
- That's a relief.  - What do you mean?

1190
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:07,380
没什么 我只是这么一说
Nothing. I don't mean anything.

1191
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:10,360
Mary
Mary!

1192
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:12,520
你妈妈说过我要来吗
Did your mother warn you I was coming?

1193
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:14,520
她说过
She did.

1194
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:16,540
为什么你这么快又回到约克郡了
Why are you back in Yorkshire so soon?

1195
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:18,888
本来不会这么快
I'd no sooner got back than I was

1196
00:58:18,889 --> 00:58:21,440
但我被派到惠特比去参加佃农大会
despatched to a tenant farmers' convention in Whitby.

1197
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:24,360
可会议已经结束了 我准备从这儿回家
But it's over now, so I'll go home from here.

1198
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:27,360
- 我能问你个问题吗  - 当然
- Can I ask you something? - Of course.

1199
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:30,380
- 有点古怪   - 说吧
- It's an odd question.  - Go on.

1200
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:34,114
假设你认为有个人涉嫌犯罪
If you thought a man was involved in a crime,

1201
00:58:34,115 --> 00:58:35,340
或是一起事故
or an incident,

1202
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:37,440
但你不责怪他
but you didn't blame him,

1203
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:40,520
你甚至觉得正义在他这边
in fact you thought right was on his side,

1204
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:42,520
你会怎么做
what would you do?

1205
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:45,440
这个问题稍微理论化了些
It's a bit theoretical for an opinion.

1206
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:48,520
- 你不认为他是错的吗   - 是的
- But you don't believe he was wrong? -  No.

1207
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:50,807
看来我所知不多
Well, I'm guessing in the dark,

1208
00:58:50,808 --> 00:58:53,440
但要是我 我会守口如瓶
but...I suspect I would say nothing.

1209
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:00,540
这不公平 锤子加重了
That isn't fair. It's weighted.

1210
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:04,400
你来试试吧 Molesley先生 到你了
Go on. You have a go, Mr Molesley.

1211
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:07,420
不了 如果Jimmy都不成 我更没戏
No, no, I won't manage it if Jimmy can't.

1212
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:10,460
试试 我想看
Try. I want to see it.

1213
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:24,400
打得好
Well done!

1214
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:26,440
你作弊了
That was cheating.

1215
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:29,540
这个嘛 靠的只是巧劲罢了
Well, it...it's in the arms.

1216
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:33,540
主要是挥舞 然后就是一点巧劲
It's all to do with the swing, and the swing is in the arms.

1217
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:36,360
你好啊 Baxter女士
So, Miss Baxter,

1218
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:39,520
自我走后都发生过什么 说说吧
anything to tell me about life since I've been away?

1219
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:43,340
没发生什么
No. Nothing's happened.

1220
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:48,400
如果有事情 我会查出来的
I'll find out if it has, you know.

1221
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:50,300
离她远点 Barrow先生
Leave her alone, Mr Barrow.

1222
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:53,400
我们不欢迎海外回来的恶霸
We don't want any bullying brought back from overseas.

1223
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:55,360
是吧 Baxter夫人
Do we, Miss Baxter?

1224
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:59,340
现在 你还想看看其它摊位吗
Now, are there any stalls you'd still like to see?

1225
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:13,500
天哪 终于能在公共场所喝酒了
God, what a relief to be able to drink in public

1226
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:16,520
再也没有警察突击检查了  去他的禁酒令
without a policeman pouncing. Down with Prohibition.

1227
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:17,558
这段时间
You can't mean

1228
01:00:17,559 --> 01:00:20,360
你不会是一直都没得喝吧
you never had a drink all the time you were there.

1229
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:22,440
Harold 自有办法
Harold has his uses.

1230
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:24,440
我估计也是
I suppose he does.

1231
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:28,320
希望他两以后别再招惹咱了
And let us hope they both leave us in peace.

1232
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:30,320
我恐怕这希望不大
A slim hope, I'm afraid.

1233
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:31,463
Martha想带他来参加
Martha wants to bring him

1234
01:00:31,464 --> 01:00:33,440
明年夏天Rose初次进入社交界的舞会
over next summer for Rose's coming out ball.

1235
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:34,480
为什么
Why?

1236
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:35,340
她说她想
She says she wants

1237
01:00:35,341 --> 01:00:38,280
在死前再参加一次伦敦的社交季
to see another London Season before she dies.

1238
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:51,440
你还在 谢天谢地
You're still here. Thank goodness.

1239
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:53,954
我提前赶公车 但还是迟了
I caught an early bus, but it was delayed.

1240
01:00:53,955 --> 01:00:55,440
我还以为会错过你
I thought I'd missed you.

1241
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:57,460
Daisy我正要去车站
I'm off to the station now, Daisy.

1242
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:59,320
以后也不回来了
And I won't be back.

1243
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:00,948
我爸爸去世了
My dad's gone and mother's

1244
01:01:00,949 --> 01:01:03,360
妈妈搬去去和克鲁郡的姐姐做邻居
moving to Crewe to be nearer my sister,

1245
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:05,520
所以我很高兴你来送我 真的
so I'm glad you're here to say goodbye. I really am.

1246
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:07,460
我给你准备了礼物
I've brought you a present.

1247
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:10,460
Mason先生做的 整整一篮子
Mr Mason's made you a basket full of things.

1248
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:13,420
肉卷 奶酪 火腿 果酱和咸菜
Rolls and cheese and ham, and jams and pickles,

1249
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:14,865
还放了些苹果汁
and he's put some cider in too,

1250
01:01:14,866 --> 01:01:16,520
是给你在路上吃的
to keep you going on the train home.

1251
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:18,237
他真好 Daisy
That was kind of him, Daisy.

1252
01:01:18,238 --> 01:01:20,480
你确定这些不是给你做的
Are you sure it wasn't meant for you?

1253
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:22,400
不 他是为Alfred准备的
No, he did it for Alfred.

1254
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:25,400
我告诉他我们是老朋友 他就做了这些
I told him we were old friends, so he did it for you.

1255
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:35,360
--你知道Ivy拒绝我了吧   -是的
- You know Ivy turned me down? - I do, yes.

1256
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:37,540
我想我在对待她上有点犯傻
I think I've been a bit blind where she's concerned.

1257
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:39,400
爱情本来就是犯傻
Love is blind.

1258
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:42,460
也许吧 我在想我是不是又做了傻事
Maybe. But I wonder now I've not been a fool.

1259
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:46,280
你对我一直都这么好 这么真诚
You've always been so good to me, Daisy. So true.

1260
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:47,500
可我却一直没注意到
But I could never see it.

1261
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:51,360
谢谢你 我很高兴
That's kind of you to say, and good to hear.

1262
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:55,480
我爱过你 Alfred 我不会否认
I loved you, Alfred. I'll not deny it.

1263
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:59,480
但现在一切都结束了 我们也无法回到从前
But that's done with now, and what I felt won't come back.

1264
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:02,380
是时候你走你的 我走我的了
It's time for you to go your way and me to go mine.

1265
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:04,487
你会祝福我吧
But you wish me well?

1266
01:02:04,488 --> 01:02:06,480
是的 我真心祝福你 Alfred
Oh, I do, Alfred, yeah.

1267
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:09,320
那就好 那就很好了
So well. So very well.

1268
01:02:09,340 --> 01:02:10,520
永远是朋友
Friends forever.

1269
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:13,500
永远是朋友 Daisy
Friends forever, Daisy.

1270
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:19,520
好的 现在我真的得走了
Right, now this really is goodbye.

1271
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:32,480
你还好吗Daisy
Are you all right, Daisy?

1272
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:36,420
我去储藏室换上围裙
I'll just get this off and pop in the pantry for my apron.

1273
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:53,540
好了 就是这样了
Well, that's that, then.

1274
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:01,420
当你拿出那个篮子
Do you know, when you brought up that basket,...

1275
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:07,320
我真是为你骄傲 差点哭了
..I were so proud of you, I felt like crying out.

1276
01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:10,360
就算你是我的女儿
If you were my own daughter,

1277
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:13,360
我也不可能比现在更自豪了
I couldn't be prouder than I am now.

1278
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:33,376
你知道我今天为什么来吗
You do know why I came today.

1279
01:03:33,377 --> 01:03:34,440
来看义卖
To see the bazaar.

1280
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:36,400
是来看你
To see you.

1281
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:41,500
令我惊讶的是 我发现 自从我走后
I find - perhaps to my surprise - that since I left,

1282
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,480
我就一直想着你
I can't think of anything but you.

1283
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:46,340
我也很惊讶
To your surprise and my surprise.

1284
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:49,320
我只是不想放过机会
I'm only asking for a chance.

1285
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:52,500
真的有会议在惠特比举行吗
Was there really a conference in Whitby?

1286
01:03:53,540 --> 01:03:55,380
当然没有
Of course not.

1287
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,180
你真让我受宠若惊
I'm flattered,

1288
01:03:58,181 --> 01:04:00,420
Charles 还有感动
Charles, and even moved.

1289
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:04,520
但与其再在名单上添加一个对我灰心的男人
But rather than add to the list of men I've disappointed,

1290
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:07,820
现在拒绝你可能会更好些
it might be kinder to refuse you now

1291
01:04:07,821 --> 01:04:09,460
你也会释怀些
and let you off the hook.

1292
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:14,440
恐怕我是不会允许你这么做的
Hmm, I'm afraid I couldn't allow that.

1293
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:19,420
至少得让我放手一搏
Not without putting up a fight.

1294
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:34,400
你怎么还在这里啊
What are you still doing here?

1295
01:04:34,420 --> 01:04:36,440
我想知道你昨天做了什么
I wish I knew what you were up to yesterday.

1296
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:40,340
- 为什么要出门  - 我只是想出趟门
- Why did you go?   - I wanted to get away.

1297
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:43,500
你没有做什么傻事吧
You'd never do anything foolish, would you?

1298
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:47,340
你绝不会拿我们的一切去冒险吧
You'd never risk everything we've built together?

1299
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:49,380
当然不会 你了解我
Certainly not. You know me.

1300
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:50,561
当我想要做一件事时
When I do a thing, I like

1301
01:04:50,562 --> 01:04:52,420
都是会有一个非常充分的理由的
to have a very good reason for doing it.

1302
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:09,480
你们两躲到哪里去了
Where have you two been hiding?

1303
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:12,320
视野良好的地方  魔术师们的最佳藏匿处
In plain view, where all good tricksters hide.

1304
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:14,320
看看我找到了什么  Tom找找看
Look what I've found. Tom, will you see

1305
01:05:14,340 --> 01:05:16,480
桌子上还有没有干净酒杯
if there are some clean glasses on that table?

1306
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:21,300
非常好亲爱的 大获全胜啊
Well done, my dear. A real triumph.

1307
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:23,460
但愿吧
I hope so.

1308
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:26,440
我让大家明天再清扫场地
I've told them they can clear up the rest tomorrow.

1309
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:29,360
我觉得这是历史上最好的一次义卖
I thought that was the best bazaar I've known here.

1310
01:05:29,380 --> 01:05:32,500
没错 在我们这代人以后最好的
Certainly. At least since your father and I were running it.

1311
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:37,280
现在 我作为一个归家的海外浪人丈夫
And now, as the Prodigal Husband home from the sea,

1312
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:39,520
让我为我的贤妻祝酒
let me raise a glass to my extraordinary wife

1313
01:05:39,540 --> 01:05:44,340
她把一切都打理的比我在家时好
who can clearly manage far better in my absence. Cora.

1314
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:45,370
敬Grantham夫人
Lady Grantham.

1315
01:05:45,371 --> 01:05:46,380
敬Cora  - 敬妈妈
Cora.  - Mama.

1316
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,121
非常出色 Grantham夫人
Very well done, Lady Grantham.

1317
01:05:48,122 --> 01:05:50,360
现在我恐怕得走了
And now, I'm afraid, I should be going.

1318
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:52,300
你能来真好
It was so kind of you to come.

1319
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:53,355
我估计这次
I don't suppose I could

1320
01:05:53,356 --> 01:05:55,380
- 搭不了你的顺风车了吧 我坐火车来的
- ask YOU for a lift this time?  - I came by train

1321
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:58,360
- 我更喜欢驾车  - 当然
- but I'd much rather drive.  - Certainly.

1322
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:00,380
我送送你们
I'll see you off.

1323
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:06,016
我离开期间
What sort of menage has

1324
01:06:06,017 --> 01:06:08,540
到底发生了什么啊
that turned into while I've been away?
