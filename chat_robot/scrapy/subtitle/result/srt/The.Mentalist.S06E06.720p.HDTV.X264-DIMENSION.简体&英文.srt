我们得找到基拉·汀斯利
We need to find kira tinsley.

21
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:04,780
她要么跟血腥约翰是一伙的
She either works for Red John,

22
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,790
要么马上就要成为他下一个目标了
or she's about to become his next victim.

23
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,690
谁干的  告诉我
Who did this to you? Tell me.

24
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,320
简  她说什么了
Jane, what did she say?

25
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,670
她说血腥约翰左肩膀有个纹身
She told me Red John has a tattoo on his left shoulder--

26
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:24,940
三个点
Three dots.

27
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,300

简  别这么做  别扔下我这么做
Jane, don't do this, not without me.

Jane, I am begging you. You're in danger!

No, you're not.

You do this, and you're throwing your life away.

00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,600
纹身吗
A tattoo?

42
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,420
对
Yes.

43
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,740
我们可以用那个来确定血腥约翰的身份
That we can use to identify Red John?

44
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,270
-是的  -太好了
- Yes. - That's great.

45
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,360
所以我们只要一个个检查疑犯
So all we have to do is check each one of the suspects

46
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,590
看哪个人身上就纹身就行了
one by one until we find out who has the tattoo.

47
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,540
不行
No.

48
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,350
为什么不行
Why not?

49
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,580
血腥约翰还不知道我发现纹身的事
Red John doesn't know I know about the tattoo.

50
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,030
好吧
Okay.

51
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:31,770
所以如果我们去查他们
So if we start checking suspects,

52
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:33,770
很有可能血腥约翰会发现此事
it's very likely that red john will find out.

53
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:36,240
然后在我们还没机会接近他的时候就销声匿迹
And disappear before we have a chance of getting him.

54
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,450
正是如此
Exactly.

55
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,820
那你们打算怎么办
Then what do you want to do?

56
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,430
把五名疑犯同时
Gather all five suspects together

57
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,620
集合到一个地方
at the same place, same time,

58
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,430
然后再检查是否有纹身
And then start checking for the tattoo.

59
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,310
如何才能做到呢
And how do we do that?

60
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,120
就直接叫他们过来
We'll ask them.

61
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:49,880
你觉得他们会同意吗
And you think they'll agree?

62
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,250
没打算给他们选择的余地
Wasn't planning on giving them a choice.

63
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,120
就算成行了  还有个问题
Even so, there's a problem.

in connection to two homicides.

66
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,370
对  二十多年前的悬案
Yeah. Cold cases from over 20 years ago.

67
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,080
真的假的
You're kidding,

68
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,200
都过去那么多年了
after all this time,

69
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,730
联调局现在才跟进吗
the F.B.I. is moving in now?

70
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,140
他们肯定是有了什么新的
Well, they must have found something new--

71
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,570
-法医证据  目击证人  -那斯特尔斯在哪
- forensics, a witness. Well, where's Stiles?

72
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,030
关键就是这个  没人知道他在哪
Well, that's the thing. Nobody knows,

73
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:13,110
连联调局也不知道  斯特尔斯几周前就消失了
Not even the F.B.I. Stiles disappeared weeks ago.

74
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,560
我们会找到他的
We'll find him.

75
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:15,980
怎么找
How?

I don't know, but we'll find him.

00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:19,700
必须找到他
We have to.

78
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,380
我配合你的计划
I'm on board with your plan.

Good.

80

On one condition.

81
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,640
你揭露血腥约翰身份的时候我要在场
I want to be there when you reveal Red John.

00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:32,580

Okay.

83
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,030
我说真的
Seriously.

84
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,830
-我说了好的  -说是说了  但你说的肯定不算数
- I said okay. - Yeah, but you didn't mean it.

85
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,880
是吗  你怎么知道
Did I not? Uh, how can you tell?

86
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,670
这事没有商量的余地  简
This is non-negotiable, Jane.

87
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,310
我百分百同意
I agree 100%.

88
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,200
我认为我之前说得够清楚了  探员们
I think I've made myself clear, agents.

89
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,290
我完全不知道布莱特·斯特尔斯在哪
I have no knowledge of Bret Stiles' whereabouts.

90
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,490
对  你说了
Yes,

91
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,640
而我们也表达得很清楚了  你这说法我们不买账
and we've made it clear that we're not buying it.

92
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,370
斯特尔斯把天眼组织的领导权留给了你
Stiles leaves you in charge of Visualize,

93
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,140
但他却没有告诉你他躲藏在哪里吗
but he keeps you in the dark about where he's hiding?

94
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,290
这根本说不通
Doesn't make sense.

95
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,440
斯特尔斯自始至终
Stiles has and always will

96
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,860
都将教徒的需要放在他自己之前
put the church's needs before his own.

97
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,400
这次也一样
This time is no different.

98
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,790
他不想让我知道是因为他想保护我
He doesn't want me to know because he wants to protect me.

99
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,520
也因为他不想被人找到
And because he doesn't want to be found.

100
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:15,050
我不觉得布莱特·斯特尔斯担心是否会被找到
I doubt Bret Stiles is worried about being found.

101
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,690
你看起来很有信心
You seem confident.

102
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,960
这叫信仰
Call it faith.

103
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,450
斯特尔斯在我们这个
You see, Stiles' time

104
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,900
现实世界里的时间  是有限的
in our... reality is limited.

105
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,220
就在我们说话的这会
As we speak,

106
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,020
他正在做好心理和身体上的准备
he's preparing his mind and body

107
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:32,960
以摆脱我们这个物质世界的束缚
for a departure from the confines of our material world.

108
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,610
他要死了吗
He's dying?

109
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,060
这是非常天真
That is a very naive,

110
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,340
非常无知的想法
very ignorant way of looking at it.

111
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,800
布莱特·斯特尔斯不会死
Bret Stiles is not dying.

112
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,350
他也不能死
Bret Stiles cannot die.

113
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,840
他是要将自己提升到一个新的高度
He is elevating himself to another plane,

114
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,800
我们这种道行不够的
one lesser men like ourselves

115
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,200
要非常艰难才能触碰到这种高度
can only strive to reach.

116
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,650
显然我们中有人对此是无法理解的
And one some of us obviously can't comprehend.

135
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,850

Okay, but not here.

138

好吧  在哪见
Fine. Where?

I'll let you know the day of.

太扯淡了
This is crazy.

142
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:28,120
我已经犯过很多次错误了
I've made the mistake of underestimating Red John

143
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,260
总是低估了血腥约翰
a number of times now.

144
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,020
我不想再犯这种错误了
I don't want to make that mistake again.

If you want the information, it's on my terms.

为什么要搞得这么神秘
What is with all the secrecy?

我就干点跑腿的活
Oh, just running some errands.

00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,180
一切都好吗
Everything okay?

295
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,070
好极了  有事吗
Yeah, right as rain. What's up?

00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:37,210
能见他我再高兴不过了
nothing would please me more than to meet with him.

323
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:39,450
我真的很乐意  但是

好像不太能成行
it's probably not gonna happen.

你是说因为联邦调查局吗
You mean because of the F.B.I.?

327
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,360
你功课做得不错嘛
Mm. You have been doing your homework.

他们不知道我来了
They don't know I'm here.

329
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:55,380
所以他们也就不知道你在这里
Which means they don't know you're here.

330
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,130
但你要是不肯见简  他们就会知道了
But they will if you don't agree to meet with Jane.

331
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,350
你的确变了  不是吗
You have changed, haven't you?

332

你去过厄瓜多尔吗

他很穷  但野心勃勃
he was underprivileged, ferociously ambitious.

339
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:29,280
我在他身上看到了些东西
I saw something in him.

340
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:32,870
所以我决定试着帮帮他
So I decided to try and help him.

341
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,720
我帮他付学费
You know, I-I paid for his school fees,

342

N-nothing really much, but wouldn't you know it?

Anyway, he invited me to stay in this palatial consulate.

在这一片小小的外国领土上
This morsel of foreign soil.

is outside the jurisdiction of you, the F.B.I.,

So, you see, Gracie, your idle threats are just that.

You will, sir.

And I want to be there when you end this.

00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,670
我来对付斯特尔斯
I'll handle Stiles.

381
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,930

He's not gonna come with you. He doesn't have to.

382
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,420

I'll be persuasive.

383

You don't want me to be there.

390
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,660
是的
No, I don't.

391
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,270
你不希望我在场是因为你觉得

Are you saying that you won't?

394
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,670
我想说的是
What I'm saying is some men--

397
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,840
这种人就该就地正法
They deserve what they have coming to them.

398

00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:59,160
在血腥约翰案上吗  没错
About Red John? Yes.

You would never lie, not about something like this.

00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,460
可是派翠克
But you see, Patrick,

427
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,690
将死之人还怕什么死亡威胁呢
a dying man does not fear death.

428
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:31,750
省省吧
Oh, please.

429
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,860
装模作样骗骗你那些信徒还行
This charade might work on your disciples.

430
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,250
骗我就算了吧
It doesn't work on me.

431
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:39,010
你太高估我了
You think too highly of me.

432
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,510
非常不幸的是
Unfortunately,

433
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:43,860
这次不是装的了
it's not a charade.

434
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:48,900
你还剩多长时间
How long have you got?

435
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,670
已经扩散到血液了
It's spread to the blood.

436
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:54,870
已经无药可医了  我不知道
There's nothing they can do. I don't know...

437
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,720
也许两周  也许一个月
Two weeks, a month.

438
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,520
听我说
You see...

439
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:03,680
这不是针对你
it's not personal.

440
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:05,230
只是现在
It's just that...

441
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:08,980
时间对我来说太宝贵了
my time now is very precious.

442
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,520
今晚我还是需要你来
I'm still gonna need you tonight.

443
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,960
看在上帝的份上  为什么
For god sake, why?

444
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:17,170
有什么事如此重要
What's so damned important?

445
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:18,780
血腥约翰
Red John.

446
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,420
我终于接近他了
I'm close.

447
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,770
前所未有的接近
Closer than I've ever been.

448
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,080
血腥约翰
Red John...

449
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,630
听着
Look...

450
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,750
今晚我若能去见你
nothing would give me more pleasure

451
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,900
那是再高兴不过了
than to be with you there tonight.

452
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,680
但是
But?

453
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:41,730
我的情况比你想象的复杂
There's more to this than you know.

454
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:44,230
我被困在这儿还有别的原因
There's--there's more keeping me here.

455
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:45,170
联调局吗
The F.B.I?

456
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,460
对  事实正是如此
Yeah, as a matter of fact.

457
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:48,980
他们跟我到这里
You know, they tracked me here.

458
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,390
就等着我出去
They're just waiting for me to leave

459
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:51,770
然后逮捕我
so they can arrest me.

460
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:54,060
不是我想呆在这儿的
Look, I'm not choosing to stay here,

461
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,540
我被困住了
but I'm trapped.

462
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,650
这么说联调局是唯一的问题了
So the F.B.I's the only thing that's keeping you here?

463
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,860
注意  前门有动静
Eyes up, we've got movement at the front entry.

464
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,180
是天眼组织的车
That's a Visualize car.

465
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,350
他们在偷偷往外转移什么人
I think they're sneaking someone out.

466
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:11,250
随时准备行动
Get ready to move.

467
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:14,040
立即行动  行动  上
Go now! Go! Go! Go!

468
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:33,900
-不许动  -不许动
- Don't move! - Don't move!

469
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,300
把手放在方向盘上
Hands on your steering wheel!

470
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,790
把手放在我们能看见的地方
Keep your hands where we can see 'em.

471
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:40,160
你们好  先生们
Hello. Gentlemen.

472
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,490
有什么能为你们效劳的吗
Something I can help you with?

473
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,500
斯特尔斯入局了
Stiles is in.

474
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,190
我们该出发了
We'd better get going.

475
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:20,950
我们可有很长一段车程
We've got a long drive ahead of us.

476
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:27,160
把他带走
Take him.

477
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,090
{\an8}晚上八点  马里布  雪松街1309号见  走便道

478
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:42,760

479
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:03,920
那么萨城警局只有等着了
Well, then Sac P.D.'s just gonna have to wait.

480
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:06,070
我不想用职权压人
Look, I-I don't wanna pull rank...

481
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,040
但若有必要我会的
but I will.

482
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:12,030
凯文  回头我再打给你
Kevin, I gotta call you back.

483
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,780
我需要一辆车
I'll be needing a car.

484
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,200
我们要去干什么
What are we doing?

485
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,230
我想看看日落
I want to see the sunset.

486
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,830
里斯本  有些话我想跟你说
There's something I want to tell you, Lisbon.

487
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:42,770
很早以前就应该跟你说了
Something I should have said a long time ago.

488
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:47,030
谢谢你做的一切
I want to thank you for everything that you've done.

489
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,220
晚点再谢也不迟
You can thank me later.

490
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,260
不
No, I...

491
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,360
我必须现在就说
I need to say this now.

492
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:58,570
你
You have...

493
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,480
不知道你对我意味着什么
no idea what you've meant to me.

494
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,440
你对我有多重要
What you mean to me.

495
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,130
谢谢你
Thank you.

496
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,910
差点忘了  我有个惊喜给你
I almost forgot. I have a surprise for you.

497
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,060
在这等我
Wait here.

498
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:46,620
简

499
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:48,400
简

停车
Hey! Stop!

503
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:48,470
请等等
Please.

504
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:53,070
我叫特蕾莎·里斯本
My name is Teresa Lisbon.

505
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:55,420
我是加州调查局探员
I am an agent with the California Bureau of Investigation,

506
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,720
现在我要征用你的车
and I need to borrow your car.

507
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,780
这是紧急情况
It's an emergency.

508
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,620
什么  不行
What?! No way.

509
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:00,290
立即下车  快
Get out. Now. Come on.

510
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:01,390
快
Come on.

511
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,800
太过分了
This is outrageous.

512
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,460
我要报警
I'm calling the police.

513
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:06,080
好主意  谢谢
Good idea. Thanks.

514
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:23,050
-简  -喂  里斯本
- Jane. - Hello, Lisbon.

515
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:25,720
简  别这么做  别扔下我这么做
Jane, don't do this, not without me.

516
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,840
对不起
Listen, I'm sorry.

517
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:29,480
简  求你了  你身处险境
Jane, I am begging you. You're in danger!

518
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:30,990
没事的
I-it's gonna be okay.

519
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:32,550
我不会有事的
I-I'm gonna be okay.

520
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:33,700
不可能
No, you're not.

521
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,870
你这样做是在自寻死路
You do this, and you're throwing your life away.

522
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:37,730
再见  里斯本
Bye, Lisbon.

523
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,570
简
Jane...

524
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:39,850

00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,550
我来早了吗
Am I early?

527
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:11,780
不早  来得正好  坐吧
No, no. Right on time. Have a seat.

528
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,630
911  您遇到了什么紧急情况
9-1-1. What's your emergency?

529
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:31,000
我是加州调查局的
This is Agent Teresa Lisbon

530
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,800
特蕾莎·里斯本探员
with the California Bureau of Investigation.

531
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,810
请派警员到马里布的雪松街1309号
I need officers at 1309 Cedar Street in Malibu.

532
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,370
有探员需要立即支援
I have an agent who needs immediate assistance.

533
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:44,660
我让你们五个聚在一起是有原因的
I brought you five together for a reason.

534
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,820
有人可能知道了
Some of you may know that reason.

535
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,600
也有人可能猜到了
Some of you may have guessed.

536
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:52,260
你们中的一个人
But one of you here...

537
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,370
是血腥约翰
is Red John.

538
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:00,940
什么  在我们几个中间
What?! One of us?

539
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,170
我们其中之一是血腥约翰
One of us here is Red John?

540
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,480
真有意思
Well, that's very interesting.

541
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:08,780
-是谁  -我不知道
- Who is it? - I don't know.

542
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:11,380
我们到这来就是为了找出答案
And that's what we're gonna find out.

543
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,500
你是想说这个房间里的某个人
Wait, you're trying to say that one of us in this room...

544
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,670
是个连环杀手
is a serial killer?

545
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:16,070
-我很确定  -太荒唐了
- I know it. - No, this is crazy.

546
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,630
我向你保证完全不荒唐
I can assure you it's not.

547
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:20,630
我向你保证  我才不跟你在这儿胡闹
Well, I can assure you I'm not sticking around for this crap.

548
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,320
坐下
Sit down.

549
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,350
一步都别想往门口走
Do not move toward the door.

550
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:31,910
谁都不准走
No one is leaving.

551
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:35,070
放轻松  派翠克
Take it easy, Patrick.

552
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,680
我看起来很紧张吗
Do I look distressed?

553
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,270
别动
Don't.

554
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,740
我会开枪的
I will shoot you.

555
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,500
其他人也一样
That goes for the rest of you as well.

556
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,420
慢慢把你们的枪拿出来  放在地上
Take out your weapons slowly, place them on the floor,

557
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:55,770
推到我这边来
and push them toward me.

558
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:06,140
谢谢
Thank you.

559
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:08,660
谢谢
Thank you.

560
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,250
行了  派翠克
Okay, Patrick.

561
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:16,400
够了
This is... this is enough.

562
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:17,950
该到此为止了
It's gone far enough.

563
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:20,130
不  这才刚刚开始呢
No, we're just getting started.

564
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:22,730
为这一刻  我等了十年
I've waited ten years for this moment.

565
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:26,230
多年来  血腥约翰一直很狡猾
All those years, Red John has been smart.

566
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,620
你们中的某个人一直很狡猾
One of you has been smart.

567
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:31,680
很谨慎  除了这次
Careful. But not this time.

568
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,500
这一次  你露出马脚了
