这不是件坏事 对吗
That is not a bad thing.

32
00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:41,058

48
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,099
最后的机会 法兰克
Last chance, Frank.

49
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,939
我带莎拉回家去
I'm taking Sarah home.

50

51
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,939

他还是那么栩栩如生
He still looks so lifelike.

61
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,099
好像仍然活着
He's not dead.

62
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,938
不要这样 把感伤发泄出来
Don't do that. Just let your feelings out.

63
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:32,099
不 真的
No. Really.

64
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,939
他经常这么做
He does this a lot.

65
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:55,979
对吗
Really?

66
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:01,938
不要这样 把针给我

67
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:04,099
来吧 亲爱的 快坐下
Come on, sweetie. Let's go sit down.

68
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,099
我应该先亲他的

69
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,099
你要就去吧

70
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:12,099
让我们坐下 来吧 亲爱的
Let's go sit down. Come on, sweetie.

71
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,058
这一刻 我们将开放
At this time, we'll open the floor to anyone...

72
00:05:19,059 --> 00:05:22,979
希望有人对死者说几句话
who wishes to say a few words about the deceased.

73
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:25,979
宝贝
Babe...

74
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,899
分享回忆

75
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:32,099
或者咏诗 或歌曲
Perhaps, a poem. A song lyric.

76
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,059
谁来
Anyone?

77
00:05:34,939 --> 00:05:35,939
你可以的
You can do it.

78
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,899
先生
Sir?

79
00:05:56,059 --> 00:05:58,979
马文
Marvin was...

80
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,899
与众不同
different.

81
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,019
他
He was...

82
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,979
一个好人
a vey good shot.

83
00:06:08,059 --> 00:06:09,899
有人说
Some would say that...

84
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,019
他很偏执
he was paranoid.

85
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,058
但是你也能想到些
But you have to expect a little of that...

86
00:06:16,059 --> 00:06:18,099
因为中情局给了LSD
when the CIA's dosing you with LSD...

87
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,939
差不多十年了
for a little more than a decade.

88
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:23,019
他可以引爆一个炸弹
He could wire a bomb...

89
00:06:25,059 --> 00:06:27,059
比任何人都要快
faster than anybody I ever met.

90
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,939
我所知道的人当中
The good people of Moldova will always...

91
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,019
马文是最好的
be in Marvin's debt.

92
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,859
他是个真正的好朋友
He was a really good friend.

93
00:06:46,059 --> 00:06:47,099
真的很好
Really good.

94
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:50,019
我会怀念他的
I'm gonna miss him.

00:06:51,059 --> 00:06:52,059
会想念他的

96
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:54,938
我们该走了
We have to move.

97
00:06:54,939 --> 00:06:55,899
加拿大
Canada?

98
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,938
离开这危险之地 那里有个小农场
High ground. Good kill zones. It's a little farm.

99
00:06:58,939 --> 00:07:02,899
农场 像耕农一样
A farm? Like, to farm on?

100
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,099
像种小麦
Like, with crops?

101
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,019
是啊 很有趣
Yeah. It could be fun.

102
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,979
听着 宝贝
Listen, babe...

103
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:11,099
你要知道人们常说 重要的是经过
You know they say it's really important not to make big...

104
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:15,059
危难之后才会做出选择
life altering decisions right after a loss.

105
00:07:15,939 --> 00:07:18,979
他们可以杀了马文 也可以杀了你或我
If they can get to Marvin, they can get to you and they can get to me.

106
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,099
他们是谁
Who are they?

107
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,899
到安全的地方去
Go to the safe house.

108

到安全的地方去
Go to the safe house.

111
00:07:31,939 --> 00:07:33,099
我不会离开你的
I'm not leaving you.

112
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,019
真的没事的
It'll be All right.

113
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:36,899
这是什么
What is it?

114
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,019
摩西先生
Mr. Moses...

115
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,938
他们要你做一份白扬基的汇报
They want to debrief you at a Yankee White facility.

116
00:07:40,939 --> 00:07:41,979
是你的狙击手吗

你对冷战有特殊的兴趣

149
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,899
他们是来杀我们的
They're coming to kill us.

150
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,019
打开手铐
Get me outta these cuffs.

151
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:14,018
我不能 先生
I can't do that, sir.

152
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:15,059
你有钥匙 对吧
You have the key, right?

153
00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:18,399
举起手来
Hands up!

154
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:20,059
50英尺
50 feet.

155
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,859
如果不打开手铐 他们会杀了我们
They're gonna kill us both, if you don't get me outta these cuffs.

156
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:28,859
快点
Come on.

157
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:41,059
法兰克?摩西
Frank Moses.

158
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,979
你可是我心目中的大英雄
Coming up through the ranks, you were my hero.

159
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,979
时间充足 每个人都会受不了
Given enough time, I guess eveyone cracks.

160
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:50,979
法兰克
Frank.

161
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:54,100
你是谁  我吗
Who are you?

162
00:09:54,101 --> 00:09:55,019
Me?

163
00:09:56,019 --> 00:09:58,099
我是政府雇用收集情报的
I'm the guy the government hires to get information.

164
00:09:59,019 --> 00:10:02,059
我为求情报不择手段
And I'm allowed to use any form of torture I deem fit.

165
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,939
我打算折磨莎拉 直到你开口
And I will torture Sarah until you speak.

166
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:09,939
提到莎拉
Speaking of Sarah...

167
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:12,059
我喜欢看着她
I love watching her...

168
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,939
在浴缸里挣扎的样子
shave her legs in the tub.

169
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,979
令我想起了刚果叛军
Kinda reminds me of these Belgian mercs I met in the Congo.

170
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:24,018
他们为了情报而活剥人的皮肤
They would skin people alive to get them to talk.

171
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:25,418
你知道他们在哪里开始的吗
And do you know where they started?

172
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:26,979
猜猜看
Guess.

173
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:34,019
脚踝 就像你的莎拉一样
At the ankles. Just like your Sarah.

174
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,899
所以
So...

175
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,979
给我满意的答案
you either give me the information that I need to know...

176
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,859
否则对你的女友毫不留情
Or I'm gonna filet your girl from head to toe with no mercy.

177
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,099
真棒啊
Awesome.

178
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:09,979
哇
Wow.

179
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,979
退休真好 但是你
Pretty good for a retired guy. But are you

180

向他开枪 但别杀了他
Shoot him, but don't kill him.

185
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,139
好了 杀掉他吧 散开
All right, kill him. Spray it up.

186
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,099
法兰克 这是你最后的机会
Frank, this is your last chance.

187
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:38,979
射击
Fire.

188
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,019

00:13:27,019 --> 00:13:27,979

00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:50,399
马文

191
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,059
你把我逼疯了
You're driving me crazy!

192
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:52,939
我带钥匙来了
I brought the key.

193
00:13:56,899 --> 00:13:57,979
你骗我你死了
You faked your death.

194
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,019
我们该走了
Gotta go.

195
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:01,399
走吧
Let's go.

00:14:01,899 --> 00:14:02,399
快走
Gotta go.

197
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:05,538
我现在该怎么办
You have no idea what you put me through!

198
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,939
感谢老天爷 你没事
Thank God, you're okay.

199
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:12,440
不
No!

200
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,099
你在这里干什么
What are you doing here?

201
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,859
马文从那屋子把我带出来
Marvin brought me. From the house.

202
00:14:18,019 --> 00:14:20,059
大家都疯了吗
Has eveybody lost their mind?

203
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,018
你怎么能把一个女孩带到这里
You don't bring a girl like that here.

204
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:23,258
我必须确认你没事
I had to see if you were okay.

205
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,099
甜心
Honey!

206
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,059
我以为
I thought...

207
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:26,979
什么
What?

208
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:31,099
我不是说过要低调点吗
Remember when we discussed how you were gonna lay low?

209
00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:33,378
你又没有告诉我到何时为止
You don't get to tell me when to lay.

210
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,019
我是没有这么说
I'm not saying that.

211
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,019
止住 就停住
Stop. Just don't.

212
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,939
你现在要对我发飙吗
You're mad at me now?

213
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,099
你一直像对玩偶一样耍我
You treat me like a China doll.

214
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,898
法兰克 我能给你一点忠告吗
Frank, can I give you a little advice about women?

215
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:46,099
当然不
Absolutely not!

216
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:50,979
你扪心自问一下 什么样的女孩喜欢你这种家伙
Ask yourself, what is a girl like that doing with a guy like you?

217
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,059
这不是你的样子
It ain't for your looks.

218
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:55,059
我会射你 我会射掉你的肝脏
I will shoot you. I will shoot you in the liver.

219
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,059
A, R, D, A
A, R, D, A.

220
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,939
冒险 浪漫 危险
Adventure, romance, danger...

221
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,018
活动 你们可以是一对搭挡
activities you can share as a couple.

222
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:06,059
是因为你骗了我
It's about you lying to me.

223
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:08,018
法兰克
Frank...

224
00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:12,059
我很感动你在我的葬礼上哭
I was vey touched that you cried at my funeral.

225
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,059

That's not true.

226
00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:25,059
我根本没有哭
I didn't cy at your funeral.

227
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:26,939
我没有哭
I'm no crier.

228
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,979
96小时 有人在网上泄露文件
96 hours ago, somebody posted a document on the Internet...

229
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:40,059
提到我与你参与的"暗影行动"
that said you and I took part in an operation called Nightshade...

230
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,939
在79年时
back in '79.

231
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,018
所以你装死吗
That's why you fake died?

232
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:45,939
是啊 唠叨的快撑破屋顶了
Yeah. The chatter went through the roof.

233
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,018
所以老是很多人追你
So eveybody's after you...

234
00:15:48,019 --> 00:15:51,859
问你一些你不知道的事情
for something they think you know that you don't even know at all?

235
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:57,099
喔 天啊 蜘蛛
Oh my God! Spiders!

236
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,059
亲爱的 你最好藏到我不知道的地方
Honey, you need to go to ground and it's best I don't know where.

237
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,059
我哪里也不去
Yeah, I'm not going anmhere.

238
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,979
只用现金 不能打电话
Cash only. No calls.

239
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:04,939
不要联系
No contacts.

240
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:05,939
谢谢 听着
Thanks. Look...

241
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:09,059
我不会躲在安乐窝里
I'm not hanging out in some bunker...

242
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,059
当你在外面一边与深肤色的性感女人鬼混
while you slink around and save the planet...

243
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,979
一边去拯救世界
with dusky international femme fatales.

244
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:14,979
深肤色的性感女人

我知道那是什么意思 马文
I know what it means. Marvin.

247
00:16:19,899 --> 00:16:23,099
我现在的处境很危险
It's hard to be the kinda person I have to be right now...

248
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,939
要做的事情也很困难
and do the kinda things that I'm going to have to do...

249
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,059
而你在这里
while you're here.

250
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,059
这对我们都不是很好
This is gonna be good for us.

251
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,099
我们要怎么做
What are we doing?

252
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,059
我们面对它 科伦坡 让事情可以控制
Face it, Columbo, things were getting a little stale.

要跟国防部怎么报告
And the SecDef wants a briefing?

266
00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:16,099
你是罪魁祸首
You were brought in to contain this.

267
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,059
冷静点
Calm down.

268
00:17:17,899 --> 00:17:20,019
我无法相信事隔多年故事又重演了
I can't believe this is coming back on me after so many years.

269

FBl正以谋杀罪搜捕他们
The FBI is seeking them for the murders.

271

国安局把他们列为恐怖份子

273
00:17:29,899 --> 00:17:30,399
是的
Yes.

274
00:17:30,939 --> 00:17:34,059
问题是 如果文件在网路上流传
The problem is with that document su_acing on the Internet...

275
00:17:34,939 --> 00:17:36,939
所有参加"暗影行动"的人将曝光
all the players will be coming after Nightshade.

276
00:17:41,899 --> 00:17:43,058
这事可能会被史书记载

277
00:17:43,899 --> 00:17:46,059
我去国防部一趟 我们要公诸大众

It's been tried, sir. Didn't work so well for those guys.

284

你认为我会屈服你的暴行吗

"暗影行动"是个疯狂的计划

584

585
00:38:44,019 --> 00:38:46,058
受意识和恐惧的驱动

586
00:38:46,059 --> 00:38:48,139
对这美丽的世界没有爱

587
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:51,059
我不能相信像你这样的畜生
I can't trust animals like you!

588
00:38:53,899 --> 00:38:54,939
随你怎么做
Do what you will.

589
00:38:55,979 --> 00:38:56,979
死亡很简单
Death is easy.

590
00:38:57,899 --> 00:39:00,059
但这不是目的 主要是过程
It's not about the destination.it's about the journey.

591
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,978
死亡在俄国是一门艺术

592
00:39:03,979 --> 00:39:08,019
有很多方法让一个人开口

我们从剥下他的脸皮开始 压住他
Shall we start with a Chechen facelift? Hold him down!

594
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,978

这就是我们的风格
This is how we do it.

求你了 你这么勇敢

但是你必须明白

我们这么做有正当的理由 还有

00:39:30,019 --> 00:39:32,019
这不值得你去卖命
This isn't worth your life.

600

女人

604
00:39:49,099 --> 00:39:50,059

613
00:40:33,939 --> 00:40:36,979
真的吗 你这样勾搭上的
Seriously? You hooked up with that?

614
00:40:39,059 --> 00:40:41,099
女人啊
What a woman.

615
00:40:43,939 --> 00:40:45,059
那是同样一件吗
Is that the same dress?

616
00:40:46,939 --> 00:40:48,019
你看起来是一样的吗
They look the same to you?

617
00:40:53,979 --> 00:40:56,899
没有人称我是"法兰克・摩西的克星"
No one ever called me Frank Moses' kyptonite.

618
00:40:57,899 --> 00:40:58,978
法兰克对你太着迷了
Frank's crazy about you.

619
00:40:58,979 --> 00:41:01,939
我从没看过他那么害怕失去了你

如果我毁了他的人生怎么办
What if I'm ruining his life?

621
00:41:09,899 --> 00:41:13,019
法兰克是个单纯生物 他的需求很简单

622
00:41:13,979 --> 00:41:15,019

什么意思呢
What's your point?

628
00:41:26,899 --> 00:41:29,058
我无法相信你吻了这只"青蛙"
I can't believe you kissed The Frog.

629

Well, I've kissed a lot of frogs.

630
00:41:32,979 --> 00:41:34,098

"青蛙"秘密保险柜的钥匙
The key to The Frog's security deposit box.

633
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:39,018

00:41:39,019 --> 00:41:40,899
里昂信贷银行
Credit Lyonnais.

635
00:41:46,019 --> 00:41:49,099
宝贝 我有个请求

636

今晚与我一起出去吃晚餐如何
How would you feel about going out to dinner with me tonight?

637
00:42:00,099 --> 00:42:02,018
毕竟这里是巴黎

638

641
00:42:24,939 --> 00:42:25,979
这可不是好时机
It's not a good time.

642
00:42:26,939 --> 00:42:30,018
我们有个老同事说有重要的情报

643
00:42:30,019 --> 00:42:31,979
他需要马上见我们

644
00:42:33,899 --> 00:42:34,399
不行
Nah.

645
00:42:35,939 --> 00:42:38,018
法兰克 你在干什么 她是你的克星
Frank, what are you doing? She's kyptonite.

646
00:42:38,019 --> 00:42:39,978
我会处理好的
I'll handle it.

647
00:42:39,979 --> 00:42:40,939
你肯定吗
Are you sure?

648
00:42:43,939 --> 00:42:44,899
是
Yeah.

649
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:51,018
不太好吧 还有工作呢 不是开玩笑的
It's not okay. It's just some work. No, it's not fun.

650
00:42:51,019 --> 00:42:54,058
走 去和斯维特兰娜干活吧
Go. You and Svetlana work it out.

651
00:42:54,059 --> 00:42:58,859
我保证会回来一起吃晚餐的

653
00:43:06,979 --> 00:43:07,979
照顾她的安全
Keep her safe.

654
00:43:15,939 --> 00:43:17,059
我们怎么了 法兰克
What happened to us, Frank?

655
00:43:17,979 --> 00:43:19,098
嗯
Well...

656
00:43:19,099 --> 00:43:24,019
你背叛我 你坑了我 你打算杀了我
You betrayed me. You set me up. Tried to kill me.

657
00:43:24,979 --> 00:43:26,059
我是打算杀了你
I tried to kill you.

658
00:43:27,899 --> 00:43:29,938
这是最好的机会 不是吗
They were good times, weren't they?

659
00:43:29,939 --> 00:43:34,019
知道吗 如果你要我背叛我的国家 你知道我会的
If you'd asked me to betray my county, you know I would have.

660
00:43:37,979 --> 00:43:38,939
是的 夫人
Yes, madam.

661
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:43,019
天啊
My God.

662
00:43:44,899 --> 00:43:47,899
知道吗 我见过你们
You know, I looked you up once.

663
00:43:48,899 --> 00:43:50,979
在洛杉矶的屋子里
You were in a bungalow in Los Angeles.

664
00:43:51,899 --> 00:43:53,939
屋前满满的玫瑰
There were roses out in front.

665
00:43:55,059 --> 00:43:56,899
但我失去了我的自信
But I lost my nerve.

666
00:44:07,899 --> 00:44:10,899
那么你想怎样呢
So what do you want?

667
00:44:11,939 --> 00:44:15,898
和你都只是工作关系 规则
It was all about work with you. Rules.

668
00:44:15,899 --> 00:44:16,979
不是规则
Not rules.

669
00:44:17,899 --> 00:44:19,019
是对与错
Right and wrong.

670
00:44:19,899 --> 00:44:25,098
违抗命令对我来说很难
It's harder for me not to follow orders.

671
00:44:25,099 --> 00:44:27,859
我可以不顾个人感受
Despite my personal feelings.

672
00:44:28,939 --> 00:44:31,899
但感觉与对错无关
But feelings don't matter any more than right or wrong.

673
00:44:33,899 --> 00:44:36,098
命令至关重要
Orders matter.

674
00:44:36,099 --> 00:44:38,098
命令
Orders?

675
00:44:38,099 --> 00:44:40,059
俄国会操纵这里的一切
Russia will handle things from here.

676
00:44:41,059 --> 00:44:42,939
我要拿走钥匙
I'm taking the key.

677
00:44:44,939 --> 00:44:46,059
我不会让这种事发生的
I can't let that happen.

678
00:44:46,979 --> 00:44:47,979
不会吗
No?

679
00:44:55,939 --> 00:44:59,859
我的胳臂失去知觉了
I can't feel my arms.

680
00:45:04,899 --> 00:45:05,979
享受堪萨斯吧
Enioy Kansas.

681
00:45:19,899 --> 00:45:20,859
他失去知觉了
He's out.

682
00:45:24,059 --> 00:45:25,938
或许会清醒过来
He might be awake.

683
00:45:25,939 --> 00:45:27,019
很好 那就会有感觉了
Good. So he can feel it.

684
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:32,059
在你整个生涯中
Did you ever, ever in your entire career...

685
00:45:32,899 --> 00:45:35,018
有没有什么让你变得麻木
let yourself get drugged?

686
00:45:35,019 --> 00:45:37,059
我就是不喜欢她
I just don't like her!

687
00:45:38,939 --> 00:45:40,059
现在她有钥匙了
And now she has the key!

688
00:45:40,899 --> 00:45:43,938
她没有钥匙  她有钥匙
She doesn't have the key. She has a key.

689
00:45:43,939 --> 00:45:45,058
什么
What?

690
00:45:45,059 --> 00:45:48,978
我知道她会让他中计
I knew she would play him like a banjo at an Ozark hoedown.

691
00:45:48,979 --> 00:45:50,099
所以我保留钥匙了
So I have the key.

692
00:45:52,059 --> 00:45:53,939
水
Water.

693
00:46:11,099 --> 00:46:13,018
我还要多久才能离开
How long was I out for?

694
00:46:13,019 --> 00:46:15,018
有一些是他的
Some of it's his.

695
00:46:15,019 --> 00:46:16,099
马文
Et tu, Marvin?

696
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:18,298
风格是生活中唯一不变的
Style is the only constant in life.

697
00:46:20,899 --> 00:46:23,899
我们来巴黎不是渡假的
We didn't come to Paris on vacation.

698
00:46:25,979 --> 00:46:30,018
我以为你是来巴黎"血拼"的
Shopping's what I thought you did in Paris...

699
00:46:30,019 --> 00:46:31,978
用你男朋友的钱
with your boyriend's money...

700
00:46:31,979 --> 00:46:33,978
当你在等他的时候
while you're waiting for him...

701
00:46:33,979 --> 00:46:35,098
在沉迷中醒过来
to wake up from being taken down...

702
00:46:35,099 --> 00:46:39,978
他的前任俄国女婊子
by his skanky, slutty, Russian bitch ex girlfriend.

703
00:46:39,979 --> 00:46:40,979

So thanks.

704
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:44,058
感谢你所有的恭维
Thanks for the compliment for the fur.

705

告诉我我穿这条裙子很好看

707

也让我感觉你也很好

708
00:46:53,939 --> 00:46:55,058
为什么他对我这么做
Why is she doing this to me?

709
00:46:55,059 --> 00:46:56,939
我们可以叫计程车

710
00:46:57,939 --> 00:46:59,979
听着 我有些事要跟你说
Listen, I gotta tell you something.

711
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:05,018
你需要把你的感受告诉周围的人
You have to share your feelings to evolve your relationship.

712
00:47:05,019 --> 00:47:07,059
虽然刚开始很别扭
Even if it seems uncomfortable at first.

713
00:47:07,899 --> 00:47:10,098
譬如你被困在火海里
Say you're pinned down in a firefight.

714
00:47:10,099 --> 00:47:13,978
如果你待在原地就会烧死 知道吗
If you stay where you are, you're gonna die. Okay?

715
00:47:13,979 --> 00:47:16,978
那么 你怎么做
So what do you do?

716
00:47:16,979 --> 00:47:17,978
逃跑啊
Make the run.

717

她怎么可能发现我们呢

752
00:50:53,059 --> 00:50:56,019
因为我告诉她 我们要来了

753
00:51:00,019 --> 00:51:02,939
我无法承受事情不确定的压力
I couldn't take the pressure of not knowing.

754
00:51:11,019 --> 00:51:13,019
为什么她不朝我们开枪

我认为他现在什么也不会说
I don't think he's gonna say anything now.

768

你必须去找摩西和博格斯

它是秘密关押罪犯的监狱

777
00:52:47,899 --> 00:52:49,219
深藏在那座大楼中
buried deep within that building.

778
00:52:49,939 --> 00:52:51,979
就像监狱中的监狱
It's like a prison within a prison.

779
00:52:54,019 --> 00:52:56,059
我们要怎么进去
How are we gonna get in there?

780
00:53:00,019 --> 00:53:02,098
他想要我的头
She wants my head!

781
00:53:02,099 --> 00:53:03,938
这是天主教的阴谋
It's a Papist plot.

不 不
No! No!

788
00:53:20,979 --> 00:53:25,019
头戴王冠可不简单啊
"Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown."

789
00:53:25,979 --> 00:53:29,018
他们所有的人都想要反抗我
They're plotting against me. All of them.

790
00:53:29,019 --> 00:53:30,939
这才是个好皇后
There's a good queen.

791
00:53:32,099 --> 00:53:35,059

00:53:38,019 --> 00:53:40,979
如果不介意 别再叫我老妖怪了
Not so much the "old", if you don't mind.

794
00:53:49,899 --> 00:53:51,058
我觉得这个很不错
I think it was really good.

795
00:53:51,059 --> 00:53:53,059
我以为在引导Bette Davis呢

电脑表单上没有你的名字

趴在地板上 很好
Lay down on the ground.

维多利亚
Victoria.

826
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:38,938
维多利亚 你应该看看这个 列宁的 "国家与革命"
Victoria! You should read this. Lenin. " State and Revolution."

827
00:55:38,939 --> 00:55:41,058

833
00:55:51,059 --> 00:55:54,938
抱歉 这是药物作用 影响我的记忆
sorry, it's the drugs they're feeding me, it's my short term memory.

834
00:55:54,939 --> 00:55:59,059
一种让我平静而又无害的东西
Something that's meant to keep us peaceful or harmless!

835
00:55:59,899 --> 00:56:03,059
反正就在附近 但我又不知道在哪里
Anmay, it's around here somewhere, but I don't know where.

836
00:56:04,099 --> 00:56:07,098
贝利教授 我们需要你的帮助
Dr. Bailey, we need your help.

837
00:56:07,099 --> 00:56:09,099
你记得"暗影行动"吗
Do you remember Nightshade?

838
00:56:09,939 --> 00:56:14,018
抱歉 我在找烟斗和圣克里斯托弗奖章
I'm looking for my pipe and my St. Christopher medallion.

839
00:56:14,019 --> 00:56:16,099
那些年轻人把它给别人了 都是些小孩
Boys gave it to someone. They were little boys.

840
00:56:16,899 --> 00:56:19,059
大概跑到哪里去了
And now it's gone somehow.

841
00:56:29,939 --> 00:56:31,979
喔 糟糕
Oh shit!

842
00:56:33,059 --> 00:56:34,978
法兰克 我在这里
Hey, Frankie, I'm over here.

843
00:56:34,979 --> 00:56:36,898
我找到了 一直在我的口袋里
I found it. It was in my pocket the whole time.

844
00:56:36,899 --> 00:56:38,978
尽管我找不到烟斗了 还好在这里
I couldn't find my damn pipe, though. But here it is.

845
00:56:38,979 --> 00:56:41,059
抱歉 亲爱的 你刚才问我什么
sorry, my dear, what was the question you asked me?

846
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:43,059
你记得"暗影行动"吗
Do you remember Nightshade?

847
00:56:43,899 --> 00:56:46,018
我记得那是一种炸弹
Vaguely. It was some kind of a bomb, I believe.

848
00:56:46,019 --> 00:56:49,938
有人正在找它 想要使用它
People are looking for that weapon. People who want to use it.

849
00:56:49,939 --> 00:56:52,058
亲爱的 我了解 相信我
Oh dear. Yes, I do understand of course. Believe me.

850
00:56:52,059 --> 00:56:55,098
我为美国制造了很多东西
But I made many things for the Americans and...

851
00:56:55,099 --> 00:56:57,099
"暗影行动"是最吓人的杰作
Nightshade turned out to be a bit of a nightmare.

852
00:56:57,899 --> 00:56:59,098
与众不同 又非常危险
It was quite different. Turned out to be too dangerous.

853
00:56:59,099 --> 00:57:01,938
所以他们自然要把我关在这里
So naturally, they had to lock me up in this place.

854
00:57:01,939 --> 00:57:04,018
即使他们对我做了这些事后 我觉得这很正常
And after what they did to me, I think it's perfectly natural...

855
00:57:04,019 --> 00:57:07,059
我警告过他们要滚远点
I tell them all to go F off!

856
00:57:08,099 --> 00:57:11,018
MI6想制造贝利死亡的谎言
MI6 tried to fake Bailey's death?

857
00:57:11,019 --> 00:57:12,059
为什么 他们想隐瞒什么
Why? What are they hiding?

858
00:57:12,899 --> 00:57:15,180
你得走了 他们发现你了
You're gonna have to go. You're gonna have to go find out.

859
00:57:16,979 --> 00:57:19,098
他们想杀了我的
You know they're gonna Ty and kill me.

860
00:57:19,099 --> 00:57:20,098
到俄国再找你
I'll call you from Russia.

861
00:57:20,099 --> 00:57:22,899
维护7号桥
Maintenance to Bridge 7.

862
00:57:23,939 --> 00:57:25,979
安全系统出现紧急状况
We got a breach in Maximum Security.

863
00:57:34,899 --> 00:57:35,979
保全
Secure!

864
00:57:41,059 --> 00:57:42,938
什么事那么重要
What's so important?

865
00:57:42,939 --> 00:57:46,098
我刚从MI6得到消息 爱德华贝利还活着 并已经逃走了
I just heard from my source at MI6 that Edward Bailey's alive and on the run.

866
00:57:46,099 --> 00:57:47,019
这不可能
That's not possible.

867
00:57:47,899 --> 00:57:50,018
这比想像中的麻烦还大
This is bigger than a rogue General and his unexploded ordinance.

868
00:57:50,019 --> 00:57:51,058
我还有什么不知道的
What don't I know?

869
00:57:51,059 --> 00:57:52,938
游戏改变了
The game has changed.

870
00:57:52,939 --> 00:57:55,058
贝利知道的事情太危险了
The things Bailey knows are too dangerous.

871
00:57:55,059 --> 00:57:59,099
如果贝利或者暗影行动落入恐怖份子 将有数万人会丧生
If Bailey or Nightshade fall into terrorist hands, millions will die.

872
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:02,018
喔 天啊 这是真的
Holy shit, it's real.

873
00:58:02,019 --> 00:58:05,058
除非我们销毁它，那个武器正在莫斯科中心地区
Unless we secure it, that weapon's going off in the middle of Moscow.

874
00:58:05,059 --> 00:58:07,979
这就是我们最好的应急措施
Right now, that's our best case scenario.

875
00:58:14,939 --> 00:58:16,939
俄罗斯
RUSSIA

876
00:58:39,019 --> 00:58:41,859
伙计们
Guys?

877
00:58:59,099 --> 00:59:01,979
欢迎 我的朋友们
Welcome, my friends.

878
00:59:04,059 --> 00:59:09,018
传言是真的 你还活着
So, it is true. You're alive.

879
00:59:09,019 --> 00:59:13,059
告诉我 是谁操控的
Tell me, then, where is this device?

880
00:59:13,979 --> 00:59:15,899
谁
Who?

881
00:59:18,939 --> 00:59:20,899
我们在努力
Work in progress.

882
00:59:22,899 --> 00:59:25,058
我从来没有想过
I never thought I'd be smuggling...

883
00:59:25,059 --> 00:59:29,058
带法兰克・摩西到俄罗斯中心地区去
Frank Moses into the heart of Mother Russia.

884
00:59:29,059 --> 00:59:31,098
我也是
Me, neither.

885
00:59:31,099 --> 00:59:34,058
在我忘记前 这里有点小东西
Before I forget. A little something.

886
00:59:34,059 --> 00:59:38,018
如果你被抓了或韩抓了你
If you are caught or Han catches you...

887
00:59:38,019 --> 00:59:43,019
服药自杀是最好的选择
suicide pill is a much better option than what you face.

888
00:59:44,899 --> 00:59:48,059
就算死 也会死得很漂亮
You die with Russian smile on.

889
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:52,979
祝好运
Good luck.

890
00:59:54,019 --> 00:59:55,058
贝利教授
Mr. Bailey.

891
00:59:55,059 --> 00:59:56,058
法兰克
Yes, Frank?

892
00:59:56,059 --> 01:00:01,018
有什么方式可以告诉我们核武器在哪里
Is there any way you could tell us where you hid the nuclear weapon?

893
01:00:01,019 --> 01:00:04,979
这些堡垒 可真是漂亮啊
Look at all those cows. They're beautiful.

894
01:00:05,899 --> 01:00:07,859
堡垒
Yeah.

895
01:00:08,979 --> 01:00:10,979
母牛
Cows?

896
01:00:15,979 --> 01:00:18,899
嗨！
Hi! Yoo hoo!

897
01:00:21,939 --> 01:00:24,019
情况不妙
That's not good.

898
01:00:24,899 --> 01:00:26,979
莫斯科
MOSCOW

899
01:00:36,979 --> 01:00:39,899
我们被跟踪了 法兰克
We have eyes on, Frank.

900
01:00:59,019 --> 01:01:00,939
我的飞机在哪里
Where's my plane?

901
01:01:02,979 --> 01:01:05,018
他们雇我来杀你
They paid me to kill you.

902
01:01:05,019 --> 01:01:07,059
没有说要保留全尸
They didn't say I had to do it all at once.

903
01:01:07,899 --> 01:01:08,978
别动
FREEZE

904
01:01:08,979 --> 01:01:09,939
把手放头上
HANDS ON YOUR HEAD

905
01:01:22,939 --> 01:01:25,058
波士奇呼叫 这里有警察受伤
THIS IS OFFICER BOESKY. OFFICER DOWN

906
01:01:25,059 --> 01:01:27,939
我们需要医生
WE NEED MEDICALASSISTANCE

907
01:01:35,019 --> 01:01:38,098
别动 把手放头上
FREEZE, HANDS ON YOUR HEAD

908
01:01:38,099 --> 01:01:39,939
他怎么了
What's wrong with him?

909
01:02:36,939 --> 01:02:38,059
哇
Wow.

910
01:02:38,899 --> 01:02:40,098
这是什么地方
What is this place?

911
01:02:40,099 --> 01:02:41,979
我第一个安全屋
My first safe house.

912
01:02:43,099 --> 01:02:47,059
邻家女孩 是从1984年开始的
Untouched, since 1984.

913
01:02:54,059 --> 01:02:56,058
河豚毒
Fugu poison?

914
01:02:56,059 --> 01:02:59,938
那可是剧毒
Fugu poison is deadly stuff. Terrible death.

915
01:02:59,939 --> 01:03:03,099
看到了吗 XKG毒气 我发明的
This little gizmo? XKG gas. I invented it.

916
01:03:04,059 --> 01:03:07,018
我们想在61年刺杀古巴总统卡斯楚
We tried to take out old Fidel Castro in '61 in Cuba.

917
01:03:07,019 --> 01:03:09,018
但是没有奏效
That didn't work though.

918
01:03:09,019 --> 01:03:10,019
选一个吧 法兰克
Any tea, Frank?

919
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:12,099
为什么韩那么讨厌你
Why does Han hate you so much?

920
01:03:12,899 --> 01:03:14,059
从小时候起他就讨厌我
Not enough hugs as a child.

921
01:03:16,059 --> 01:03:21,098
法兰克盗取了国家的机密
Frank framed him for stealing state secrets.

922
01:03:21,099 --> 01:03:25,059
然后从一个优秀情报员
So he went from being a highly decorated counter intel officer...

923
01:03:25,899 --> 01:03:28,059
变成可怕的杀手
to being a pariah.

924
01:03:28,939 --> 01:03:30,978
最讽刺的是 法兰克
What's ironic is that Frank...

925
01:03:30,979 --> 01:03:35,058
总在刺杀时出现了些状况
actually created the circumstances for his own death.

926
01:03:35,059 --> 01:03:37,018
很戏剧性
It's poetic.

927
01:03:37,019 --> 01:03:38,059
我还没有死
I ain't dead yet.

928
01:03:46,899 --> 01:03:50,098
你在吃那东西
Should you eat that?

929
01:03:50,099 --> 01:03:52,098
安全吗
Is that safe?

930
01:03:52,099 --> 01:03:56,859
它还是在  过期之前
It's before they had that, you know, "sell by" date stuff.

931
01:03:59,899 --> 01:04:02,058
所以你见过卡斯楚了
Did you get to meet Castro?

932
01:04:02,059 --> 01:04:03,059
谁
Who?

933
01:04:03,939 --> 01:04:05,058
你见过卡斯楚了
Did you get to meet Castro?

934
01:04:05,059 --> 01:04:07,300
当然 在甘乃迪死后的二星期
Yes, I did. About 2 weeks after Kennedy was assassinated.

935
01:04:07,939 --> 01:04:09,018
顺便说一下 法兰克
Talking of which, Frank...

936
01:04:09,019 --> 01:04:12,019
我开始记起来我是谁了
I'm starting to remember more and more who I am...

937
01:04:12,860 --> 01:04:14,018
我以前干什么的 还有我制造的武器
and who I was and the weapons I made.

938
01:04:14,019 --> 01:04:16,058
天啊 太神奇了
My God, it really is amazing.

939
01:04:16,059 --> 01:04:19,978
MI6的人都是好人 上帝保佑他们
How efficiently those boys from MI6, God bless 'em...

940
01:04:19,979 --> 01:04:22,180
但他们确实遗弃了我们 不是吗 老兄
But they really do throw us away. Don't they, old sport?

941
01:04:22,899 --> 01:04:25,058
我们年龄大了 大概吧
When we're no longer convenient, I suppose.

942
01:04:25,059 --> 01:04:27,419
好像我们没有把最好的时光献给它
As though we'd never given them the best years of our lives.

943
01:04:27,939 --> 01:04:28,979
真是个天大的笑话
Bit of a ioke, really.

944
01:04:29,979 --> 01:04:31,939
没错 真奇怪
Yes, vey strange.

945
01:04:33,059 --> 01:04:36,059
你记得"暗影行动"在哪里吗
Do you remember where Nightshade is?

946
01:04:36,979 --> 01:04:38,098
抱歉 亲爱的
I'm sorry, my dear?

947
01:04:38,099 --> 01:04:41,018
你记得"暗影行动"在哪里吗
Do you remember where Nightshade is?

948
01:04:41,019 --> 01:04:42,059
当然记得
Oh, yes.

949
01:04:43,939 --> 01:04:45,859
好像是穿过这里
This feels right.

950
01:04:48,899 --> 01:04:51,099
我来过这里 我肯定
It's around here somewhere. I'm sure this time.

951
01:04:51,979 --> 01:04:54,058
一切都变不一样了
Eveything looks different completely.

952
01:04:54,059 --> 01:04:56,018
可能是穿过这里
Maybe it's over here.

953
01:04:56,019 --> 01:04:56,978
一小时了
It's been hours.

954
01:04:56,979 --> 01:04:58,058
就是这里
Yeah, this is it.

955
01:04:58,059 --> 01:05:00,058
我们到了
Here we are.

956
01:05:00,059 --> 01:05:02,939
你觉得这事和吉米周有什么关系
How are those Jimmy Choos working out for you?

957
01:05:03,899 --> 01:05:05,018
入口在上面
The entrance is up there.

958
01:05:05,019 --> 01:05:06,098
约翰爸爸
PAPA JOHN'S

959
01:05:06,099 --> 01:05:07,978
谁是约翰爸爸
Who's Papa John?

960
01:05:07,979 --> 01:05:09,058
刚听到的
It's new.

961
01:05:09,059 --> 01:05:10,059
去哪里的入口
Entrance to what?

962
01:05:10,899 --> 01:05:12,938
穿过古陵寝的秘密通道
Secret tunnels through the old catacombs.

963
01:05:12,939 --> 01:05:14,978
这曾是布里滋涅夫情妇的秘密通道
Brezhnev used it to sneak his mistress in.

964
01:05:14,979 --> 01:05:15,898
在那里吗
In where?

965
01:05:15,899 --> 01:05:16,859
在那里
In there.

966
01:05:18,019 --> 01:05:19,978
克里姆林宫
The Kremlin?

967
01:05:19,979 --> 01:05:21,978
核弹在克里姆林宫
The weapon is in the Kremlin?

968
01:05:21,979 --> 01:05:23,979
那是他们唯一不会检查的地方
It's the one place they wouldn't look.

969
01:05:40,979 --> 01:05:43,979
天啊 你能让它保暖吗
Jesus.Do you mind keeping it warm?

970
01:05:57,979 --> 01:06:01,058
你不知道你所做造成了多大破坏
You have no idea the damage you've done.

971
01:06:01,059 --> 01:06:04,058
你居然把自己人关了32年
You kept one of our own locked up for 32 years.

972
01:06:04,059 --> 01:06:05,179
我要让世界维持和平
I have kept the world safe.

973
01:06:05,939 --> 01:06:07,018
如果核武落入不法份子手中呢
If that weapon falls into the wrong hands.

974
01:06:07,019 --> 01:06:08,899
武器
The weapon?

975
01:06:09,979 --> 01:06:13,059
你真是什么都不懂
You haven't the slightest idea.

976
01:06:19,019 --> 01:06:22,978
你要马上联系摩西 他不知道是陷阱
You must let me call Moses. He doesn't know what he's walking into.

977
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:27,058
你已经有过这机会的 都结束了
You've had your chance. It's over.

978
01:06:27,059 --> 01:06:29,099
我很抱歉 维多利亚
I'm sorry, Victoria.

979
01:06:35,099 --> 01:06:37,939
去你妈的抱歉
sorry, my ass.

980
01:06:38,979 --> 01:06:41,058
他们说你是这里的传奇
They say you're a legend around here.

981
01:06:41,059 --> 01:06:42,019
但是 我...
I've...

982
01:06:43,099 --> 01:06:45,059
我从没有听说过
I've never heard of you.

983
01:06:45,939 --> 01:06:48,939
一定要说些我以前的事
Must have been a bit before my time.

984
01:06:54,099 --> 01:06:56,859
现在听说过我了吧
You've heard of me now.

985
01:06:59,059 --> 01:07:03,098
他们怎么检测不到核弹的幅射呢
How is it possible they never picked up the radiation signature from that bomb?

986
01:07:03,099 --> 01:07:05,059
这个问题很好
That's the million dollar question.

987
01:07:06,979 --> 01:07:10,018
嘿 伙计 这是新的
Hey, gang. This is new.

988
01:07:10,019 --> 01:07:12,019
墙的后面是什么呢
What do you think is behind that wall?

989
01:07:14,099 --> 01:07:16,099
应该是俄国人
I think Russians.

990
01:07:39,059 --> 01:07:41,978
要是有人发现这个洞 我们就死定了
If anybody sees that hole, we're dead.

991
01:07:41,979 --> 01:07:43,938
我需要你解除核武装置
I'm gonna need you to help me to disarm the weapon.

992
01:07:43,939 --> 01:07:45,859
要有人在外面把风
Somebody's gotta guard the door.

993
01:07:46,939 --> 01:07:47,898
不
No.

994
01:07:47,899 --> 01:07:48,859
但是
But...

995
01:07:50,099 --> 01:07:51,019
你需要这个
