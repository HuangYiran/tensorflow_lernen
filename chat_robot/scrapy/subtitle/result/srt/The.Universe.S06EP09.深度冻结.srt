00:00:00,334 --> 00:00:02,541
混沌初世，一片黑暗
Male narrator: In the beginning, there was darkness.

2
00:00:02,583 --> 00:00:04,263
接着...爆炸
And then... Bang.

3
00:00:04,763 --> 00:00:07,250
产生了无边无际的
Giving birth to an endless expanding existence

4

时间、空间和物质
of time, space, and matter.

5
00:00:09,958 --> 00:00:13,464
有一个地方，每天都有新发现
Every day, new discoveries are unlocking the mysterious,

6
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:16,638
但它依然极端神秘，让人饶有兴趣
the mind-blowing, the deadly secrets of a place

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,791
它就是宇宙
we call the universe.

8
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:24,319
在深邃虚无的太空
In the deep nothingness of space,

9
00:00:24,638 --> 00:00:27,513
宇宙的沉默被打破
the cosmic silence is broken.

10
00:00:30,735 --> 00:00:32,957
太空其实很嘈杂
- Space is actually kind of a noisy place.

11
00:00:35,582 --> 00:00:39,124
星系、恒星、行星和卫星
narrator: Galaxies, stars, planets, and moons

12
00:00:39,207 --> 00:00:42,207
高唱着奇异的外域神曲
sing out with strange and alien music.

13
00:00:43,013 --> 00:00:45,666
它们让人以为是外域发来传真
- They sound a little bit like an alien fax.

14
00:00:46,471 --> 00:00:48,138
我们将以倒数的形式
narrator: Now the cosmic playlist

15
00:00:48,152 --> 00:00:50,039
揭晓宇宙十大金曲
in a top ten countdown,

16

向大家呈现宇宙最精彩的...
the greatest hits of the universe...

21
00:01:14,137 --> 00:01:17,290
在太空，无人能听到你的尖叫
In space no one can hear you scream.

22
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,582
作为雷德利·斯科特导演的
As the promo line for Ridley Scott's

23
00:01:21,596 --> 00:01:23,346
科幻电影《异形》的广告词
science-fiction film Alien,

24
00:01:23,457 --> 00:01:26,512
它刻意地让你背脊发凉
it was designed to send chills down your spine.

25
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,749
它基于一个混乱的认识
It's based on the unsettling idea

26
00:01:30,886 --> 00:01:32,748
认为太空是真空的
that space is a vacuum,

27
00:01:32,886 --> 00:01:36,656
声音，无论是尖叫、呼喊，还是唱歌
and sounds, whether screams, shouts, or songs,

28
00:01:37,007 --> 00:01:38,886
都不能在真空里传播
can't travel in a vacuum.

29
00:01:40,237 --> 00:01:42,007
果真如此吗？
But is that really true?

30
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:47,837
这种想法太狭窄
- Well, it's kind of narrow to think that,

31
00:01:47,864 --> 00:01:50,243
不仅在太空里, 你听不到任何人的尖叫
in space, you can't hear anyone scream,

32
00:01:50,351 --> 00:01:53,675
而且在地球，也有许多声音我们听不到
because, in fact, here on Earth, there are lots of sounds we can't hear.

33
00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:56,229
它们或是音调太高，或是音调太低
They're either too high a pitch or too low a pitch.

34
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,505
再者，太空不是完全空洞的
Moreover, space isn't completely empty.

35
00:02:00,181 --> 00:02:02,721
最后一点，太空的定义是什么？
And then finally, you know, what's the definition of space?

36
00:02:02,992 --> 00:02:05,789
如果我是在火星表面的宇航员
If I'm an astronaut on the surface of Mars

37
00:02:05,803 --> 00:02:08,776
穿着宇航服的我，是不是在太空里？
and I have a spacesuit on, am I in space, or am I not?

38
00:02:08,803 --> 00:02:10,214
我会认为是
Well, I would think I am.

39
00:02:11,025 --> 00:02:13,498
好的，就这里
- Okay, let's try right over here.

40
00:02:16,119 --> 00:02:17,092
说回地球
narrator: Back on Earth,

41
00:02:17,173 --> 00:02:19,192
美国加利福尼亚州
Bruce Betts of The Planetary Society

42
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,970
帕萨迪纳行星学会的布鲁斯.贝茨
in Pasadena, California, has given a lot of thought

43
00:02:21,983 --> 00:02:24,611
对火星和声音颇有研究
to Mars and the subject of sound.

44
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,470
他在计算机上编写了
He's programmed his computer

45
00:02:30,497 --> 00:02:32,990
他命名为“火星终结者”的程序
with what he calls the "Marsinator"

46
00:02:33,138 --> 00:02:36,239
去演示在火星寒冷的二氧化碳大气层中
to demonstrate what his voice would sound like in the cold,

47
00:02:36,252 --> 00:02:38,887
在没有宇航服的情况下
carbon-dioxide atmosphere of Mars...

48
00:02:39,942 --> 00:02:42,050
他的声音是怎样的
without those space suits.

49
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:47,497
火星大气层会改变你的声音
- The atmosphere of Mars would actually change your voice

50
00:02:47,644 --> 00:02:50,163
听起来较为低沉
so it sounded deeper.

51
00:02:50,387 --> 00:02:53,866
让我们用“火星终结者”来进行模拟
So let's go ahead and simulate that using the Marsinator,

52
00:02:53,893 --> 00:02:55,515
我会录下我的声音
and I will record my voice,

53
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:56,920
然后让它变成
and then we will shift it

54
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:59,069
在火星上听到的声音
to what it would sound like on Mars.

55
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:02,123
这是我在火星上的声音
This is what I'd sound like on Mars,

56
00:03:02,245 --> 00:03:05,426
我当然希望能有氧气呼吸
although I'd be wishing I had some oxygen to breathe.

57
00:03:05,696 --> 00:03:10,088
然后我通过“火星终结者”对它进行加工
Then I go ahead and process it, put it through the Marsinator.

58
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:13,034
接着我们回放它，听一听是什么样子
And then we play it back and see what it sounds like.

59
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,548
这是我在火星上的声音
This is how I would sound on Mars,

60
00:03:16,656 --> 00:03:19,621
我当然希望能有氧气呼吸
although I'd be wishing I had some oxygen to breathe.

61
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:23,918
当然，如果真的有人在火星上这样做
narrator: Of course, if humans ever do make it to Mars,

62
00:03:24,378 --> 00:03:27,351
我们不会透过大气层听到他们的声音
we will not hear their voices through the atmosphere.

63
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:31,486
我们要依赖的是无线电波...
Instead, we'll get them via radio waves...

64
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:35,897
这种在我们身边萦绕的重要声音
the way many of our most important sounds already reach us.

65
00:03:36,046 --> 00:03:36,938
是
- Yes.

66
00:03:37,694 --> 00:03:40,275
我们一想到声音，总是想起
- We're familiar with thinking of sound as something

67
00:03:40,289 --> 00:03:41,911
穿过空气来到跟前的东西
that comes through the air to us,

68
00:03:41,951 --> 00:03:44,181
正如谈话时彼此所听到的
just like we hear each other when we're talking,

69
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,538
但实际上，许多我们听到的声音
but, in fact, a lot of the sounds that we hear

70
00:03:46,552 --> 00:03:49,351
是用电磁信号来传送的
are transmitted through electromagnetic signals.

71
00:03:49,619 --> 00:03:52,721
例如，电机是把电视信号
For example, your television actually transmits

72
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:55,862
转化为声音，让你能听到
a television signal into sound that you can hear.

73
00:03:56,241 --> 00:03:58,092
谁是今晚的第一个选手？
- Who's our first contestant tonight?

74
00:04:00,057 --> 00:04:01,382
宇宙里的声音
narrator: Sound in the cosmos

75
00:04:01,395 --> 00:04:04,179
永远也不会穿过虚空直达我们这里
will never reach us directly across empty space,

76
00:04:04,814 --> 00:04:08,071
所以无线电、光，或者其它电磁波
so radio, light, or other electromagnetic waves

77
00:04:08,355 --> 00:04:10,111
是必不可少的载体
are the inevitable carriers,

78
00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:12,909
从而让我们能够通过聆听
bringing us a universe we can hear...

79
00:04:13,455 --> 00:04:15,550
去认识宇宙的多样性
in all its variety.

80
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,725
太空其实很嘈杂
- Space is actually kind of a noisy place.

81
00:04:20,036 --> 00:04:22,258
它有许许多多的杂音
It has many, many sources of noise

82
00:04:22,347 --> 00:04:23,718
我们能够通过
that we are able to detect

83
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:26,252
射电望远镜之类的工具去探测它们
with special radio telescopes, for example.

84
00:04:30,785 --> 00:04:32,204
这些外域声音
narrator: These alien sounds

85
00:04:32,218 --> 00:04:34,058
构成了一个不可思议的
make up an incredible collection-

86

超级播放列表
the ultimate playlist.

87
00:04:36,299 --> 00:04:39,440

88
00:04:39,467 --> 00:04:42,223
投票决出了十个

And now the countdown starts.

92
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,202
第十名是
Coming in at number ten,

93
00:04:57,405 --> 00:05:00,621
跨越130亿光年而来的
ringing out from a distance of 13 billion light-years,

94
00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:04,459
宇宙初生时的婴啼，我们称它为
the birth cry of the universe in a hit called

95
00:05:04,594 --> 00:05:07,121
“大爆炸余音”
"The Audio Afterglow of the Big Bang."

96
00:05:11,924 --> 00:05:15,613
引人注目的是，年幼宇宙曾发出了一个声音
- It's remarkable that the young universe actually made a sound,

97
00:05:15,667 --> 00:05:20,185
让我们能够知道
and the reason we know that is that we can actually witness

98
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:25,187
发光气体在当时已经存在
the glowing gases that were present at that time.

99
00:05:28,822 --> 00:05:30,349
这些气体散发的光
narrator: The glow from these gases

100
00:05:30,362 --> 00:05:33,578
被认为是宇宙微波背景辐射
is known as the cosmic microwave background radiation,

101
00:05:34,619 --> 00:05:36,341
即CMBR
or CMBR.

102
00:05:37,192 --> 00:05:39,638
它是一种微弱的微波
It is a faint trace of microwaves

103
00:05:39,746 --> 00:05:42,719
充斥在太空的每个角落
that stretches across every point in the sky.

104
00:05:44,895 --> 00:05:48,017
科学家们在20世纪60年代中期
Discovered by scientists in the mid-1960s,

105
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:51,631
发现这种辐射是大爆炸的余音
the radiation is the afterglow of the big bang.

106
00:05:53,698 --> 00:05:56,728
著名的“普朗克”CMBR卫星图
The famous Blotchy satellite map of the CMBR

107
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:59,268
反映了诞生初期
represents the cosmos in its infancy,

108
00:05:59,698 --> 00:06:02,820
只有380,000岁时的宇宙
when it was only 380,000 years old.

109
00:06:05,515 --> 00:06:07,353
我们观察CMBR图
- When we look at the CMBR map,

110
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:10,663
其实是在观察早期宇宙的声纹
we're essentially looking at a voice print of the early universe,

111
00:06:10,988 --> 00:06:13,494
因为这些颜色的微弱变化
because those tiny variations in color

112
00:06:13,677 --> 00:06:15,989
相当于温度的变化
correspond to variations in temperature,

113
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:19,399
也相当于密度和压力的变化
and those correspond to variations in density and pressure.

114
00:06:20,075 --> 00:06:22,208
受压的波就是声波
Well, pressure waves are just sound waves.

115
00:06:22,331 --> 00:06:24,752
因此，压力的细小变化
So we're seeing little variations in pressure,

116
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:27,588
就是早期宇宙的细小声波
little sound waves in the early universe.

117
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,107
为透彻理解大爆炸余音
narrator: To understand the audio afterglow of the big bang,

118
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,387
我们得去了解早期宇宙
we need to know how the early universe

119
00:06:35,472 --> 00:06:38,337
怎样让压力发生变化，去形成声波
varied its pressures to generate sound waves.

120
00:06:39,594 --> 00:06:41,810
为此，天文学家马克.怀特
To find out, astronomer Mark Whittle

121
00:06:41,878 --> 00:06:43,979
和风琴制作者曼纽尔.罗萨莱斯
and organ builder Manuel Rosales

122
00:06:44,289 --> 00:06:46,262
到加州的克莱尔蒙特联合基督教会
visit the magnificent pipe organ

123
00:06:46,275 --> 00:06:49,451
参观了一架华丽的管风琴
at Claremont United Church of Christ in California.

124
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:59,592
从某方面来说，这架管风琴的4,000根音管
In a way, the 4,000 pipes in this organ are comparable

125
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:02,768
所发出的声音堪比早期宇宙的嗓音
to the voice of the early universe.

126
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,503
曼纽尔，早期宇宙让人非常惊讶
- Manuel, the amazing thing about the early universe is that

127
00:07:10,849 --> 00:07:12,845
它是万音齐鸣
all its pipes were sounding together,

128
00:07:13,368 --> 00:07:16,062
用这架管风琴来演绎它，应该很好听
and it would be lovely if we could just try that with this organ.

129
00:07:16,138 --> 00:07:19,125
我们同时弹奏出所有音符，好吗？
So do you think we could do that now, play all the notes at once?

130
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:22,393
好的，尽力而为吧
- Yes, let's pull out all the stops and try it.

131
00:07:22,517 --> 00:07:24,106
神曲来啦
- Ah, that's where that phrase comes from.

132
00:07:24,131 --> 00:07:25,482
- 好  -  好，动手
- Yes. - Okay, let's go.

133
00:07:34,185 --> 00:07:39,009
非常强劲，只是有点象嘶嘶的白噪声
Very powerful, but really hissy white noise kind of sound,

134
00:07:39,441 --> 00:07:42,785
但宇宙的原始声音有一个非常特别之处
but an even more remarkable thing about the primordial sound

135
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:45,333
它的音调较为独特
is that, in fact, a few particular tones

136
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,457
而且在任意的时间段内很明显
were present and were stronger at any given time.

137
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,872
这就是首先出场的第十名
narrator: This is the opening note of hit number ten,

138
00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:00,656
“大爆炸余音”
"The Audio Afterglow of the Big Bang."

139
00:08:01,034 --> 00:08:04,439
通过计算机的分析，它那明显的音调
A computer sound analyzer reveals its strong tones

140
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,442
在彩色码图中显著不同
as distinct columns on a color-coded graph.

141
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:10,297
虽然早期宇宙也有嘶嘶声
As hissy as the early cosmic sound is,

142
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,506
但它不同于纯粹的白噪音...
it differs from pure white noise...

143
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,575
(白噪音)

144
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:18,395
它在分析仪上毫无规律
which has no organized features at all on the analyzer.

145
00:08:20,964 --> 00:08:22,547
（余音）

146
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:25,289
这个“余音”，在另一方面
The sound of the audio afterglow, on the other hand,

147
00:08:25,356 --> 00:08:28,003
让人听起来音色含糊
comes through with a vaguely musical quality.

148
00:08:28,033 --> 00:08:28,978
（余音）

149
00:08:29,117 --> 00:08:32,103
（白噪音）

150
00:08:32,242 --> 00:08:35,561
（余音）

151
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:44,349
管风琴的音管都由木头和金属制成
The pipes of this, or any organ, are made of wood and metal,

152
00:08:44,619 --> 00:08:48,354
而组成早期宇宙音管的材料是暗物质--
but the pipes of the early universe were pits of dark matter,

153
00:08:48,908 --> 00:08:51,895
只有从重力才能感知其存在的
the mysterious substance whose existence is known

154
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,490
神秘物质
only from its gravity.

155
00:08:56,017 --> 00:08:59,098
声波的载体是重力
- What drives the sound waves is gravity.

156
00:08:59,908 --> 00:09:02,185
举例来说，如果某一个区域
So, for example, if there's a region

157
00:09:02,212 --> 00:09:04,832
有稍微高密度的暗物质
of slightly higher density of dark matter,

158
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:07,158
就会有吸引力
there's a gravitational force pulling in.

159
00:09:07,536 --> 00:09:10,158
周围的气体感受到吸力
Gas that's surrounding this region feels that pull,

160
00:09:10,171 --> 00:09:11,549
就会跑进去
and it falls in.

161
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:15,609
但它是气体，正如跑进去一样，它会产生压缩
But it's gas, so it also as it falls in, it compresses.

162
00:09:16,015 --> 00:09:17,880
这种压缩就象弹簧
That compression acts like a spring,

163
00:09:18,069 --> 00:09:19,947
推动气体返回出来
and so it pushes the gas back out.

164
00:09:20,271 --> 00:09:23,961
然后它过度膨胀，直到再次跑进去
But then it overshoots until it falls back in again.

165
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:27,981
气体就是这样运动着，跑进去，弹出来
This is how the motion of the gas falls in, bounces out,

166
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,602
跑进去，弹出来
falls in, bounces out.

167
00:09:29,615 --> 00:09:33,358
所以就产生了一个振荡的压力波，即声波
So we have an oscillating pressure wave, a sound wave.

168
00:09:37,561 --> 00:09:39,359
宇宙背景辐射
narrator: The cosmic background radiation,

169
00:09:39,499 --> 00:09:42,729
至关紧要的是，它只是一个静止图像
as important as it is, is just a still picture.

170
00:09:43,418 --> 00:09:45,391
它所反映的声音
Its imprint of sound has the effect

171
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:49,121
只是嘈杂声，与音乐简直不沾边
of no more than one noisy, barely musical note.

172
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,324
很难听
And even hearing that is a struggle.

173
00:09:54,256 --> 00:09:56,621
管风琴帮我们揭示个中原因
The pipe organ helps show us why.

174
00:09:59,748 --> 00:10:02,789
宇宙的声音远比我们听到的低沉
- The sounds of the universe are way too low for us to hear.

175
00:10:03,005 --> 00:10:06,316
这架管风琴的最低音出自哪里？
In fact, what's the lowest note that this organ plays?

176
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:08,639
出自一根32英尺长的音管
- It is a pipe 32 feet long,

177
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,105
只能用脚来弹奏它
and it can only be played with one's foot.

178
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,159
哦，相当低沉
- Yeah, that's pretty deep.

179
00:10:17,362 --> 00:10:20,511
对宇宙来说，32英尺的长度等于没有
32 feet were nothing compared to the cosmic organ pipes.

180
00:10:20,551 --> 00:10:25,990
其音管长达20,000至400,000光年
They were between 20,000 and 400,000 light-years across.

181
00:10:26,395 --> 00:10:28,708
对不起，我们没有这么长的音管
- Sorry, we don't have any pipes quite that long.

182
00:10:28,976 --> 00:10:29,827
对
- No.

183
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:36,967
早期宇宙的声音如此低沉
narrator: The deep sound of the early universe is so low,

184
00:10:37,165 --> 00:10:40,725
我们只有把它变高，才能听得到
we can hear it only after a massive shift upward.

185
00:10:49,414 --> 00:10:51,560
宇宙背景辐射
The background radiation of the universe

186
00:10:51,677 --> 00:10:55,352
始于宇宙诞生后的380,000年
dates from 380,000 years after its creation.

187
00:10:56,298 --> 00:10:58,501
但之前发生了什么呢？
But what happened before that?

188
00:10:59,082 --> 00:11:02,985
可能会发现自大爆炸的那一瞬间起
Is it possible to uncover the whole song of the universe

189
00:11:03,406 --> 00:11:06,696
完整的宇宙之歌吗？
from the very instant of the big bang?

190
00:11:14,696 --> 00:11:18,574
在宇宙响荡着的外域声音中
The cosmos is filled with a symphony of alien sounds,

191
00:11:18,783 --> 00:11:20,881
我们现在欣赏着的是
and we're counting down the top ten

192
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:23,094
精选出来的第十首
of the universe's greatest hits.

193
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,341
这首“大爆炸余音”
Number ten on the playlist sings out

194
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,513
它唱出了
with the earliest tones of the universe

195
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,323
宇宙最早期之音
from "The Audio Afterglow of the Big Bang."

196
00:11:36,843 --> 00:11:39,464
但是，我们在解读这宇宙婴啼的时候
But our download of the universe's birth song

197
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,897
遇到了一些困难
has some problems.

198
00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:45,424
由于宇宙是同时万音齐奏
With the cosmic organ playing all its pipes at once,

199
00:11:45,613 --> 00:11:47,443
我们耳朵听到的声音
what reaches our ears sounds like

200
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:50,686
只是一片混乱的嘈杂声
only one complex, noisy note.

201
00:11:52,835 --> 00:11:56,170
它只有一个调，这是因为它是
It's only one note because it comes from the pressure waves

202
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,470
从宇宙背景辐射图解读出来的压力波
we read from the map of the cosmic background radiation,

203
00:11:59,565 --> 00:12:03,152
那只是描绘宇宙诞生380,000年后的
which is just a still picture of the sound in the early universe

204
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:07,016
早期宇宙声音的静止图像
taken 380,000 years after its birth.

205
00:12:07,814 --> 00:12:10,233
我们怎样去倒流时光
How then do we run the clock backwards

206
00:12:10,395 --> 00:12:12,503
听一听歌曲的其它部分呢？
and hear the rest of the song?

207
00:12:13,225 --> 00:12:15,333
现代天文学相当先进
- Modern cosmology is sufficiently advanced

208
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,874
它可以利用计算机
that it's possible to create a computer replication,

209
00:12:18,887 --> 00:12:21,237
模拟幼年期的宇宙
a simulation of the young universe.

210
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:25,460
能够重现从最初的最初
It's possible to re-create within a computer

211
00:12:25,717 --> 00:12:27,743
到第一个400,000年的这段时间里
what's going on and how the sound developed

212
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,528
发生了什么事
right from the very, very beginning

213
00:12:29,663 --> 00:12:32,393
以及声音如何演变
through those first 400,000 years.

214
00:12:34,096 --> 00:12:36,906
这些超级计算机生动而形象地
narrator: They are the same kind of supercomputer simulations

215
00:12:36,933 --> 00:12:38,420
让我们知道了
that have given us pictures

216
00:12:38,501 --> 00:12:41,136
早期宇宙如何发展
showing how the early universe evolved.

217
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,845
早期宇宙的暗物质“音管”
The dark-matter pipes of the early universe

218
00:12:47,926 --> 00:12:50,088
类似于教堂管风琴的音管
acted like those in the church organ.

219
00:12:51,377 --> 00:12:55,107
越大的音管，就会产生越深沉的音调
As bigger pipes were played, deeper notes were sounded.

220
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,940
当宇宙膨胀
As the universe expanded,

221
00:12:58,094 --> 00:13:00,607
空间更大，时间更多
there was more space and more time.

222
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:04,356
更大的空间意味着更大的音管
More space meant bigger pipes.

223
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:07,029
所以在演奏的时候
So the notes in the song got lower and lower

224
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:08,721
曲调越来越低沉
as the song played out.

225
00:13:16,735 --> 00:13:20,518
如果全部算上，那么宇宙最初的400,000年
Put it all together, and the first 400,000 years of the universe

226
00:13:20,532 --> 00:13:23,430
可以被浓缩为一段10秒长的
can be condensed down to just ten seconds-

227
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:27,257
原始尖叫
a haunting primal scream.

228
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:42,652
进进出出暗物质区域的气体
- The gas that's falling in and out of these dark-matter regions

229
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:47,368
最后逐渐形成首批星体、首批星河
is ultimately going to become the first stars, the first galaxies,

230
00:13:47,401 --> 00:13:50,777
并最终将会成为我们今天所看到的
and ultimately, it'll be corralled into the thousands of galaxies

231
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,576
无数星河的一部分
that we see around us today.

232
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:59,669
所以说，重现这些声音，去聆听它们
So while it's been amusing, really, and playful

233
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,387
在好玩，富有乐趣的同时
to reproduce these sounds for us to listen to,

234
00:14:03,393 --> 00:14:04,486
我们要明白
in the big picture,

235
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,347
在未来宇宙和现时宇宙的结构构成中
they play an enormously important role in crafting the structure of the universe

236
00:14:08,361 --> 00:14:11,704
它们都扮演着非常重要的角色
that's going to unfold and the universe that we find ourselves in today.

237
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,521
我们的排行榜倒数
narrator: From the big-band sound of the big bang,

238
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,361
从大爆炸的大乐团演奏
our countdown takes a step down in size

239
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,152
转到一个不起眼的一千五百万光年大小的
to the modest 15-million-light-year span

240
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,944
星系团
of a galaxy cluster.

241
00:14:31,652 --> 00:14:33,722
宇宙十大金曲的
Coming in at number nine on our list

242
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:35,874
第九名是
of the universe's top ten hits

243
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:39,319
“英仙座沉音”
is the "Deep Tone of Perseus."

244
00:14:46,027 --> 00:14:48,718
这是一个非常低沉的声音
This is low sound to the extreme,

245
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,837
来自于英仙座星系团
emanating from the Perseus cluster,

246
00:14:51,263 --> 00:14:53,888
一个大约有1,000个星系
a grouping of roughly 1,000 galaxies

247
00:14:54,277 --> 00:14:57,402
距离地球25亿光年的地方
250 million light-years from Earth.

248
00:14:58,707 --> 00:15:01,068
这个星团的中心星系
- The central galaxy in this cluster of galaxies

249
00:15:01,082 --> 00:15:04,166
其中央有一个特大质量的巨型黑洞
has a huge super-massive black hole at its center.

250
00:15:05,068 --> 00:15:08,571
星团的中心星系称为英仙座A
narrator: The cluster's central galaxy is called Perseus A,

251
00:15:08,818 --> 00:15:11,862
它那质量超级大的黑洞，让它成为
and its super-massive black hole gives it what's called

252
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:14,235
一个活动星系核
an active galactic nucleus,

253
00:15:14,443 --> 00:15:17,790
以排山倒海之势
which shoots out energy in the form of gigantic jets,

254
00:15:18,596 --> 00:15:20,943
猛烈喷射能量到周围空间
tearing into the surrounding space.

255
00:15:21,957 --> 00:15:24,221
由于某些尚未充分了解的原因
- For reasons which we don't fully understand,

256
00:15:24,652 --> 00:15:26,082
它看起来象是在喷发
it seems to be coming out.

257
00:15:26,096 --> 00:15:28,670
大约每隔一千万年左右
The energy is being produced episodically

258
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,985
能量会短暂地产生
about every 10 million years or so.

259
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:35,818
这些能量的波动其实就是压力的波动
narrator: Those energy pulses are actually waves of pressure.

260
00:15:36,082 --> 00:15:39,193
而这恰恰正是所谓的声波：
And that's exactly what sound waves are:

261
00:15:39,707 --> 00:15:41,165
压力波
pressure waves.

262
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,971
波，正如体育迷们的展示
The wave, as demonstrated by sports fans,

263
00:15:47,054 --> 00:15:50,387
有着我们非常熟悉的上下往复运动
has an up-and-down motion that's very familiar to us.

264
00:15:50,721 --> 00:15:53,323
但加州大学伯克利分校的学生将会变化一下
But these UC Berkeley students will switch gears

265
00:15:53,415 --> 00:15:55,784
给我们展示声波是如何的不同
and show us how a sound wave is different.

266
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,581
好的，大家放好彩球
- Okay, everyone, lose the pom-poms!

267
00:15:59,845 --> 00:16:02,165
由于声波是压力波
Since sound waves are pressure waves,

268
00:16:02,206 --> 00:16:04,790
我们将请学生们制造一个压力波
we're gonna build a pressure wave out of all these students.

269
00:16:05,276 --> 00:16:07,276
好的，大家排成一行
Okay, everybody, let's line up.

270
00:16:07,498 --> 00:16:09,124
肩挨着肩
You go over here and then shoulder-to-shoulder

271
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,331
就象这样
just like this.

272
00:16:10,359 --> 00:16:12,915
一直排下去，不留缺口
Stretch out over there a little bit, no gaps.

273
00:16:13,442 --> 00:16:15,706
你们等一会要互相碰撞
You're gonna be students colliding with each other

274
00:16:15,776 --> 00:16:19,220
就象声波里的分子去互相碰撞
like molecules colliding in a sound wave.

275
00:16:19,998 --> 00:16:21,768
看起来好多了
That's looking a lot better.

276
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,478
你们是一群分子吗？
Do you feel like a bunch of molecules?

277
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:26,428
- 是  - 好的，不错
- Yeah! - Okay, okay, this is looking good.

278
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,914
队伍两端各有一面大鼓
We have a bass drum at each end of the line.

279
00:16:29,025 --> 00:16:30,150
你等着瞧
You'll see why in a minute.

280
00:16:30,164 --> 00:16:32,647
我们要用鼓来表演
We'll get things going with this drummer over here.

281
00:16:33,289 --> 00:16:35,609
在击鼓之后，请注意发生的事
He's gonna hit the drum, and watch what happens.

282
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:40,322
在这个例子中，压力很好地传递着
In this case, the pressure is a good healthy shove,

283
00:16:40,622 --> 00:16:42,234
从一个学生到另一个学生
and it moves from student to student

284
00:16:42,372 --> 00:16:43,859
传遍了整个队伍
all the way down the line.

285
00:16:43,914 --> 00:16:46,859
最后，末端的学生通过击鼓
At the end, the last student applies his pressure

286
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,956
把压力传到了第二面鼓
to the second drum by banging on it.

287
00:16:51,414 --> 00:16:53,608
第二面鼓就象是我们的耳膜
This second drum is like our eardrum.

288
00:16:53,997 --> 00:16:57,130
当空气里声波的压力冲击我们的耳膜
When pressure from a sound wave in the air hits our eardrums,

289
00:16:57,192 --> 00:16:58,497
我们就能听到声音
we hear the sound.

290
00:16:58,678 --> 00:17:01,013
正如学生的彼此推动
This is just how sound travels through the air,

291
00:17:01,247 --> 00:17:03,887
空气分子通过彼此推动
except instead of having students shoving each other,

292
00:17:03,997 --> 00:17:06,469
让声音得以穿过空气
there are air molecules shoving each other.

293
00:17:07,066 --> 00:17:09,761
声音需要分子来传送
A sound needs a medium to travel through.

294
00:17:10,553 --> 00:17:12,479
它不能穿越真空
It can't travel through a vacuum.

295
00:17:12,636 --> 00:17:15,053
所以在实际当中，要从A点去到B点
So, in fact, to get from point A to point B,

296
00:17:15,178 --> 00:17:17,594
就需要空气分子彼此碰撞
you need air molecules hitting each other.

297
00:17:17,622 --> 00:17:19,122
这就是它的运作原理
That's how it works.

298
00:17:23,622 --> 00:17:25,400
那么，第九位的“英仙座沉音”
narrator: So how do those pressure waves

299
00:17:25,413 --> 00:17:27,793
它的压力波
from number nine's "Deep Tones of Perseus"

300
00:17:28,066 --> 00:17:32,372
是如何穿越星系之间的真空地带呢？
travel through what's essentially the vacuum of intergalactic space?

301
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:37,628
俄亥俄大学的天体物理学家理查德.波格
Astrophysicist Richard Pogge of Ohio State University

302
00:17:37,844 --> 00:17:40,594
让我们在他学校的足球场上
gives us a sense of the emptiness in deep space

303
00:17:40,622 --> 00:17:42,746
体验太空深处的虚空
at his school's football stadium.

304
00:17:45,316 --> 00:17:48,052
虽然声音真的不能穿越宇宙真空
- While it's true that sound waves can't travel through the vacuum of space,

305
00:17:48,066 --> 00:17:49,675
但太空不是完全真空的
space is not a complete vacuum.

306
00:17:49,677 --> 00:17:51,816
这里是俄亥俄体育馆，七叶树队的主场
I'm here at Ohio Stadium, home of the Buckeyes.

307
00:17:51,996 --> 00:17:54,121
今天很空旷，我是唯一的人
It's very empty today. I'm the only one here.

308
00:17:54,149 --> 00:17:57,191
这个场馆能很形象地说明宇宙的真空
And I can't think of a better place to illustrate the vacuum of space.

309
00:17:58,274 --> 00:18:00,482
空空如也的体育馆可以视为
narrator: The empty stadium can be a stand-in

310
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,177
宇宙真空的替代物
for the vacuum of space

311
00:18:02,191 --> 00:18:05,316
如果与比赛日的盛况相比较的话
if we compare it with what it looks like on game day.

312
00:18:09,829 --> 00:18:13,210
在超过102,000名观众的情况下
With more than 102,000 people in its seats,

313
00:18:13,621 --> 00:18:16,815
俄亥俄体育馆如同地球的大气层
Ohio Stadium would be like the atmosphere on Earth

314
00:18:17,065 --> 00:18:19,218
空气分子摩肩接踵
jam-packed with air molecules.

315
00:18:21,621 --> 00:18:23,454
要让体育场怎样空荡荡
- So how much do we have to clear out this stadium

316
00:18:23,468 --> 00:18:25,055
才相当于宇宙真空呢？
to equal the vacuum of space?

317
00:18:25,385 --> 00:18:27,176
信不信由你，你要赶走每一个人
Believe it or not, you have to clear out everybody,

318
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,482
包括我也不例外
including me, and then even I'm too much.

319
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:33,025
只有在波格身上的一个细胞也不会留下时
narrator: No more than a single cell from Pogge's body

320
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:34,704
才能让俄亥俄体育馆
could remain in Ohio Stadium

321
00:18:34,732 --> 00:18:37,523
近似于太空深处的真空
to come close to the vacuum of deep space.

322
00:18:39,495 --> 00:18:42,273
在英仙座星系团星系之间
With what seems like almost nothing in the expanse

323
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,843
看似是空无一物
between galaxies of the Perseus cluster,

324
00:18:45,579 --> 00:18:49,995
这让声波的存在更显得不可思议
the existence of sound waves seems all the more incredible.

325
00:18:50,704 --> 00:18:53,829
怎样传送声波，让它穿越极度空洞的太空？
- How do you propagate a sound wave through empty space when it's mostly empty?

326
00:18:54,412 --> 00:18:56,551
就以奔跑在赛场上的我作例子吧
Let's use the example of me running down the field.

327
00:18:56,717 --> 00:18:58,876
在遇见别人之前，我不停地跑
I have to run a long ways before I encounter somebody,

328
00:18:58,967 --> 00:19:00,298
遇到别人了
but I still encounter somebody,

329
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,176
我就把能量传递过去
and I can pass energy along to them.

330
00:19:03,204 --> 00:19:05,314
在星际空间里的原子也是如此
The same is true of atoms in interstellar space.

331
00:19:05,439 --> 00:19:08,144
它进行漫漫长征，可能长达300光年
It has to travel a long ways,  maybe 300 light-years,

332
00:19:08,203 --> 00:19:09,762
才会遇到另外的微粒
before it encounters another particle,

333
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:11,537
当彼此相遇，它传递能量
but when it encounters it, it passes the energy,

334
00:19:11,564 --> 00:19:13,176
波就扩散出去
and the wave moves along.

335
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:18,231
在英仙座星系团里发生碰撞的微粒
narrator: The colliding particles in the Perseus cluster

336
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,564
会发射出微弱的X射线
also emit faint X-rays whose traces,

337
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:24,068
我们利用钱德拉太空望远镜
imaged by the Chandra space telescope,

338
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,203
就能知道波在那里
tell us the waves are there.

339
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:28,197
但这些波非常多
But these waves are huge,

340
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:30,328
而且所产生的音调之低
and the notes they produce are lower

341
00:19:30,342 --> 00:19:33,286
是人类从未有遇到过的
than anything any human has ever experienced.

342
00:19:35,856 --> 00:19:40,169
它的音调比我们听到的钢琴中央A音
- The pitch is about 57 octaves below our hearing,

343
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,295
要低57个八度
below the middle of a piano range,

344
00:19:42,383 --> 00:19:45,173
这足以让它作为人类知道的最低音调
and that actually qualifies this for the Guinness Book of Records

345
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,176
入选《吉尼斯世界记录》
as the deepest pitch known to man.

346
00:19:50,411 --> 00:19:53,161
这个源自英仙座的极端低音
narrator: The extreme deep note emanating from Perseus

347
00:19:53,203 --> 00:19:55,453
远远低于我们的听力范围
is so far below our hearing range

348
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,564
只有在模拟之后，才能听得到
that it can only be approximated.

349
00:19:57,967 --> 00:20:00,286
它被说成是英仙座正在演奏着的
It's been said the galaxy cluster is playing

350
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,508
令人震撼的低音降B曲调
an awesomely low B-flat,

351
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:05,610
据科学家们的估计
and scientists calculate it'll be playing constantly

352
00:20:06,161 --> 00:20:08,536
它会不停地演奏25亿年
for 2 1/2 billion years.

353
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,873
第九名的“英仙座沉音”
Number nine's "Deep Tone of Perseus"

354
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,702
已经揭开面纱
drones on, as the countdown advances.

355
00:20:18,147 --> 00:20:21,213
虽然神秘的第一名在等着我们
A secret number one waits at the end of the line,

356
00:20:21,397 --> 00:20:22,563
但我们...
but first...

357
00:20:24,952 --> 00:20:26,938
还是按次序看看第八名吧
A strange, high-pitched squeal

358
00:20:26,966 --> 00:20:29,313
这是一个来自宇宙的奇怪尖锐叫声
hints at what comes in at number eight...

359
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:34,813
它们让人以为是外星人发来的信号
sounds from space and their link to signals from...extraterrestrials.

360
00:20:34,888 --> 00:20:40,188

361
00:20:40,591 --> 00:20:42,067
从大爆炸开始
Starting with the big bang,

362
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:45,605
我们追寻着宇宙十大金曲--
we've been tracking the top ten of the universe's greatest hits-

363
00:20:46,493 --> 00:20:49,355
这些来自太空的最美妙的外域声音
the best of the alien sounds from space.

364
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:54,341
现在，让我们见识位居第八的
Jumping to number eight on the countdown,

365
00:20:55,104 --> 00:20:58,354
急速且呈多样化的声音--
we find a sudden wide variety of different sounds-

366
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:03,257
喀哒声、呜呜声和尖叫声--
clicks, whines, and screeches-

367
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:06,104
这些我们在银河系里处处能听到的
all coming from strange stars

368
00:21:06,271 --> 00:21:09,257
由奇异星球所唱出的歌声
singing out from everywhere we look in the galaxy.

369
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:13,185
它们是节奏分明的宇宙之声
They're cosmic squeals with a rhythm section

370
00:21:13,257 --> 00:21:15,410
共同谱写了一曲“韵动脉冲”
in the "Beat of the Pulsars."

371
00:21:17,229 --> 00:21:19,650
每个脉冲星的声音虽然各不相同
Every pulsar has a different sound,

372
00:21:19,882 --> 00:21:21,234
但它们有共同点
but they are all related,

373
00:21:21,354 --> 00:21:23,062
就是会重复信号
because they're repeating blips,

374
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:25,118
表现出有规律的节奏
beating out regular rhythms.

375
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,366
只是不同声音的
The different sounds come from beats

376
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,271
节拍速度不同
sounding out at different speeds.

377
00:21:34,965 --> 00:21:38,953
一开始，脉冲星发射的无线电波被探测到很有规律
The first pulsars to be detected emitted radio waves so regular

378
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:42,506
天文学家最初以为这是外星人的信号
that astronomers first thought they were signals from aliens.

379
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:46,368
但真相很快被揭开
But the truth about them was quickly discovered.

380
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,594
脉冲星是快速转动的中子星
- A pulsar is a rapidly rotating neutron star.

381
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:52,091
其密度非常高
That's a very dense star.

382
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:55,090
其两极会发射出两束辐射
And it's got two beams of radiation coming out the poles.

383
00:21:56,437 --> 00:21:59,478
当这些辐射旋转并横切过我们的视线
As those beams rotate and intersect our line of sight,

384
00:21:59,548 --> 00:22:01,423
我们就会看到一系列的脉动
we see a series of pulses.

385
00:22:05,117 --> 00:22:07,941
之所以把脉冲星与声音连系在一起
We can think of pulsars being associated with sound,

386
00:22:08,312 --> 00:22:11,200
是因为它们最初是被射电望远镜发现的
because they were first discovered with radio telescopes.

387
00:22:11,895 --> 00:22:15,478
射电望远镜检测到一系列的哔哔声
There was a series of beeps that radio telescopes detected.

388
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,770
一颗缓慢转动的脉冲星
For a slowly rotating pulsar,

389
00:22:19,784 --> 00:22:22,617
你会得到这样的节拍
you might have a series of beats like a metronome-

390
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:25,045
哔、哔、哔、哔
beep, beep, beep, beep.

391
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:28,186
(PSRB0329脉冲星，每秒1.4转)

392
00:22:29,922 --> 00:22:32,853
或者是哔-哔，哔-哔，哔-哔，哔-哔
Or you might hear a beep-beep, beep-beep, beep-beep, beep-beep.

393
00:22:32,867 --> 00:22:35,783
(船帆座脉冲星,每秒11转)

394
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:39,936
一颗快速转动的脉冲星
Now, for a rapidly rotating pulsar,

395
00:22:40,089 --> 00:22:41,450
哔哔声混杂在一起，所以会是...
the beeps blur together, so you got...

396
00:22:41,478 --> 00:22:42,769
...这样的声音
Like that.

397
00:22:42,797 --> 00:22:47,103
（蟹状星云脉冲星，每秒30转）

398
00:22:48,978 --> 00:22:51,116
一颗转动非常快速的脉冲星
And for a very rapidly rotating pulsar,

399
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,714
它会是一个连绵的声音
it's just a continuous sound

400
00:22:52,728 --> 00:22:54,797
听起来象是一个音符
that registers like a note in your ears.

401
00:22:55,019 --> 00:22:58,797
(J0437脉冲星，每秒176转)

402
00:23:00,929 --> 00:23:04,602
脉冲星是巨大质量的恒星坍塌的产物
narrator: Pulsars form from the collapse of very massive stars 

403
00:23:04,658 --> 00:23:07,116
在恒星发生超新星爆炸后形成
after they explode as supernovas.

404
00:23:10,294 --> 00:23:12,262
一颗质量巨大的恒星
But how long does it actually take

405
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:14,584
它的坍塌要花多长时间？
for a massive star to collapse?

406
00:23:15,111 --> 00:23:18,651
这是佛罗里达州坦帕市的谢尔曼想知道的...
That's what Sherman D. of Tampa, Florida, wanted to...

407
00:23:18,746 --> 00:23:20,381
宇宙问题
ask the universe，

408
00:23:20,705 --> 00:23:22,746
他为此咨询了我们
when he texted his question to us.

409
00:23:23,408 --> 00:23:26,311
谢尔曼，超新星的影响会持续数月或数年
- Sherman, the visible effects of a supernova can last

410
00:23:26,454 --> 00:23:28,900
甚至几个世纪
for months or years or even centuries

411
00:23:29,144 --> 00:23:30,690
如果你去观察超新星遗迹--
if you're looking at the supernova remnant-

412
00:23:31,008 --> 00:23:32,603
这种膨胀气体的话
the expanding gases.

413
00:23:33,238 --> 00:23:35,076
可是，虽然好象是不可思议
But although it may seem incredible,

414
00:23:35,184 --> 00:23:37,860
大质量恒星中心的坍塌
the collapse of the core of a massive star

415
00:23:37,968 --> 00:23:39,779
只不过是一两秒的事
can take just a second or two,

416
00:23:39,887 --> 00:23:42,866
跟着就引发超新星爆炸
and that's what initiates the supernova explosion.

417
00:23:46,393 --> 00:23:49,798
太阳的质量还未大到足以演变为超新星
narrator: Our own Sun isn't massive enough to go supernova,

418
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,068
但它是一个巨大的氢球
but it is a giant ball of hydrogen

419
00:23:52,588 --> 00:23:55,844
质量是地球的330,000倍
330,000 times more massive than the Earth

420
00:23:55,858 --> 00:23:57,858
因核聚变而不停燃烧
and burning by nuclear fusion.

421
00:23:58,209 --> 00:24:00,696
所以，正如下一首金曲呈现的那样
So our home star can hardly keep quiet,

422
00:24:00,723 --> 00:24:02,588
我们家园的明星很不安份
as our next hit proves.

423
00:24:04,093 --> 00:24:07,931
第七名是这首热辣的爵士金曲
This hot combo chimes in at number seven on the countdown.

424
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:11,458
“太阳之歌”
Here it is, the "Song of the Sun."

425
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,255
太阳的声音
- The Sun makes sounds,

426
00:24:15,269 --> 00:24:16,701
不可爱
but they're not really sunny sounds.

427
00:24:16,728 --> 00:24:17,999
听起来不好受
They're not happy sounds.

428
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:22,613
有点象难听的低沉咯咯声
They're kind of low, ominous roars that gurgle along.

429
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:30,128
太阳之所以发出声音
The Sun makes sounds because there are a bunch of gases

430
00:24:30,356 --> 00:24:33,252
是因为气流串由于对流而忽上忽下
going up and down through a process called convection.

431
00:24:33,423 --> 00:24:37,808
从而产生贯穿太阳这个气体球体的压力波
So they're sending pressure waves through the ball of gas that is the Sun,

432
00:24:37,983 --> 00:24:39,781
让人听起来有点象钟声
and it kind of rings like a bell.

433
00:24:44,267 --> 00:24:46,867
与钟声不同，太阳的声音
narrator: Unlike a bell, the Sun rings

434
00:24:46,881 --> 00:24:49,611
同时糅合着一千万种不同的音调
with 10 million different tones at once.

435
00:24:50,313 --> 00:24:52,448
我们从太阳表面压力波的微小鼓胀
We detect them from the tiny bulges

436
00:24:52,462 --> 00:24:54,948
可以检测到它们
from the pressure waves on the Sun's surface.

437
00:24:58,786 --> 00:25:01,543
太阳监测卫星能够对鼓胀高度
Solar satellites measure the height of the bulges

438
00:25:01,557 --> 00:25:03,170
进行十分精确的测量
with exquisite accuracy.

439
00:25:04,143 --> 00:25:07,454
除了声音，它们还带来了科学知识
Apart from sound, they also produce science.

440
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:12,495
利用观测到的太阳声音
- So using these sounds from the Sun that we can observe,

441
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:15,163
我们能够非常详尽地知道
we can actually tell very detailed things

442
00:25:15,176 --> 00:25:17,690
太阳的内部结构
about the interior structure of our star.

443
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:20,757
比如，我们能神奇地知道
For example, one of the amazing things that we can tell

444
00:25:20,784 --> 00:25:24,082
什么时候太阳背面有太阳黑子群
is when there's a sun spot group on the other side of the star,

445
00:25:24,271 --> 00:25:25,979
哪怕它还没在边缘出现
even before it comes around the limb

446
00:25:25,983 --> 00:25:28,506
还不能用光学望远镜看到它
and we're able to see it with our optical telescopes.

447
00:25:31,723 --> 00:25:35,236
太阳是太阳系里最大的声音源头
narrator: The Sun may be the biggest source for sound in the solar system.

448
00:25:35,979 --> 00:25:38,466
紧跟其后的是木星
But next in line is Jupiter.

449
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,406
它带来了位居第六位的
So coming in at number six in the top ten is a medley

450
00:25:43,445 --> 00:25:46,864
奇怪的电子杂烩“木星爵士乐”
of strange electronic "Jazz from Jupiter."

451
00:25:52,242 --> 00:25:54,087
我们能够知道“木星爵士乐”
"Jazz from Jupiter" comes to us

452
00:25:54,215 --> 00:25:57,427
是因为极其著名的两艘旅行者飞船
courtesy of the two legendary Voyager spacecraft,

453
00:25:57,896 --> 00:26:02,113
它们现在正展开史诗般的旅程，奔向太阳系边界
now on their epic journey to the edge of the solar system.

454
00:26:03,288 --> 00:26:04,677
两艘旅行者飞船
- The two Voyager spacecraft

455
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,275
在朝着星际空间飞去
are headed for interstellar space.

456
00:26:06,302 --> 00:26:09,896
它们正处于太阳势力范围的最外边缘
They're on the very outer edges of the bubble the Sun creates around itself.

457
00:26:10,213 --> 00:26:13,010
目前，旅行者1号飞船到太阳的距离
Today Voyager 1 is 118 times

458
00:26:13,037 --> 00:26:15,078
是地日距离的118倍
as far from the Sun as the Earth is,

459
00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:18,213
是海王星到太阳距离的将近四倍
almost four times as far from the Sun as Neptune is.

460
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:23,370
自从1979年这两艘飞船的
narrator: Project scientist Ed Stone has been heading

461
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:25,867
泛外空间之旅伊始
the Voyager mission since its two spacecraft

462
00:26:25,881 --> 00:26:28,070
工程师ED.斯通一直负责着
made their grand tour of the outer planets

463
00:26:28,259 --> 00:26:30,205
“旅行者任务”
beginning in 1979.

464
00:26:34,516 --> 00:26:36,327
它们在接近木星的时候
On their approach to Jupiter,

465
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:38,454
首先遇到了一件谁都没想到事
the first thing each one encountered

466
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:41,630
这个巨星的弓形激波
was the giant planet's bow shock,

467
00:26:42,211 --> 00:26:45,589
从电子信号中传出象风的声音
producing a wind-like sound from the electronic data.

468
00:26:50,946 --> 00:26:52,555
太阳向外吹出的风
- There's a wind blowing outward from the Sun

469
00:26:52,582 --> 00:26:54,109
时速约每小时一百万英里
at about a million miles per hour.

470
00:26:54,122 --> 00:26:55,379
超过了音速
It is supersonic.

471
00:26:55,811 --> 00:26:59,176
当风逐渐接触木星周围的磁场
As that wind approaches contact with a magnetic field

472
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:02,730
它只好降到次音速
around, say, Jupiter, it has to go subsonic.

473
00:27:02,865 --> 00:27:04,763
声激波就会在
There is a sonic shock which forms

474
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:07,619
木星磁场前面产生
in front of the magnetic field of Jupiter.

475
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,236
它被称为弓形激波
That's called the bow shock.

476
00:27:09,425 --> 00:27:12,912
非常象超音速飞机前面的声激波
It's very much like a sonic shock in front of a supersonic aircraft.

477
00:27:16,696 --> 00:27:18,701
比弓形激波更为有趣的是
narrator: More intriguing than the bow shock

478
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,423
木星合唱
is the Jovian chorus,

479
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:24,174
它恍如拂晓时群鸟的鸣叫声
sounding something like the chorus of birds chirping at dawn.

480
00:27:30,809 --> 00:27:34,045
它和艏波都是来自于木星磁场范围内
Both it and the bow shock come from radio waves

481
00:27:34,099 --> 00:27:37,027
快速运动的带电粒子
generated by fast-moving charged particles

482
00:27:37,207 --> 00:27:40,193
所产生的无线电波
within the bubble of Jupiter's magnetic field.

483
00:27:45,929 --> 00:27:48,955
现在，在向神秘的第一名进发的过程中
Now, the scramble toward the mysterious number one

484
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:50,497
让我们去聆听
in the top ten

485
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:54,307
在木星的卫星们与土星环之间响荡着的声音
swings to the moons of Jupiter and the rings of Saturn,

486
00:27:54,645 --> 00:27:59,429
它来自于电回路、发光气体和阵风
where the noises from electric loops, glowing gases, and streams of wind

487
00:27:59,989 --> 00:28:02,678
俨然是太阳系里的
vie for distinction as the spookiest sounds

488
00:28:02,827 --> 00:28:04,354
幽灵声音
in the solar system.

489
00:28:10,381 --> 00:28:13,508
十大宇宙外域声音，现在倒数到了
The top ten countdown in the alien sounds of the universe

490
00:28:13,643 --> 00:28:15,170
木星
has reached Jupiter,

491
00:28:15,968 --> 00:28:18,562
它正向外发送着独具特色的太空音乐
sending out its own brand of space music.

492
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,356
但这首不是独奏曲
But the next hit is no solo.

493
00:28:22,508 --> 00:28:24,414
木星有伴唱团
Jupiter has a backup group.

494
00:28:25,865 --> 00:28:29,028
伴唱者是环绕着这个巨大星球的卫星们
They're the Jovian moons circling the giant planet.

495
00:28:29,595 --> 00:28:31,663
它们各有各唱
And now they have their own album.

496
00:28:32,338 --> 00:28:35,127
十大金曲第五名是
It places at number five in the top ten,

497
00:28:36,095 --> 00:28:39,555
被称为“木卫组曲”的曲子
and the tune is called "Moons Over Jupiter."

498
00:28:43,317 --> 00:28:45,550
领唱的是卫星伽倪墨得斯
The lead singer is the moon Ganymede,

499
00:28:45,777 --> 00:28:48,168
其声音在1995年
recorded by the Galileo spacecraft,

500
00:28:48,304 --> 00:28:51,506
被抵达木星的伽利略航天器录制下来
arriving at Jupiter in late 1995.

501
00:28:52,952 --> 00:28:54,912
伽利略号发回来的
- The sounds that Galileo sent back

502
00:28:54,993 --> 00:28:56,566
木卫伽倪墨得斯的声音-
from Jupiter's moon Ganymede-

503
00:28:56,688 --> 00:28:58,642
顺便说一下，它是太阳系最大的卫星-
by the way, the largest moon in the solar system-

504
00:28:59,053 --> 00:29:00,110
非常迷人
are very intriguing.

505
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:02,944
它们让人以为是外域发来传真
They sound a little bit like an alien fax.

506
00:29:04,134 --> 00:29:06,363
说实在的，当我昨晚在办公室
In fact, when I played that sound clip

507
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:07,653
播放声音片段时
in my office yesterday,

508
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,275
人们围过来，看看我是不是
people came around the corners to see what was going on,

509
00:29:10,288 --> 00:29:12,599
在接收来自外域的信息
if I was receiving some alien transmission.

510
00:29:15,748 --> 00:29:16,923
与旅行者号一样
narrator: As with Voyager,

511
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:20,883
伽利略号发回的声音出自于电离气体，即等离子
Galileo's sounds came from ionized gas, or plasma.

512
00:29:23,307 --> 00:29:27,010
等离子中的原子分裂为负电子
Atoms in a plasma are split apart into negative electrons

513
00:29:27,024 --> 00:29:29,199
和带正电的原子核
and positive atomic nuclei,

514
00:29:30,024 --> 00:29:32,578
换而言之，即是带电微粒
in other words, charged particles.

515
00:29:34,456 --> 00:29:35,867
航天器上的
Two slender antennas

516
00:29:35,894 --> 00:29:38,394
等离子体波器的两条修长的天线
on the spacecraft's plasma wave instrument

517
00:29:38,597 --> 00:29:39,989
捕获到了
picked up the radio waves

518
00:29:40,016 --> 00:29:41,746
带电微粒因磁场而运动
that the charged particles produced

519
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:44,651
所产生的无线电波
as they were set in motion by a magnetic field.

520
00:29:49,211 --> 00:29:52,572
这些来自于伽倪墨得斯卫星的声音证明了
- These sounds that we hear from Ganymede are the evidence

521
00:29:52,873 --> 00:29:55,073
伽倪墨得斯卫星有一个磁场
that Ganymede actually has a magnetic field,

522
00:29:55,495 --> 00:29:57,738
这得归功于伽利略号上的等离子体波器
and you cannot find that information without using

523
00:29:57,751 --> 00:30:00,143
没有它，我们无法知道这一切
the plasma-wave instrument, as we did on Galileo.

524
00:30:05,419 --> 00:30:07,987
一个突如其来的外域声音
narrator: A very sudden burst of alien sound

525
00:30:08,082 --> 00:30:10,622
从木星的另一个卫星传来
came from another of Jupiter's moons.

526
00:30:11,771 --> 00:30:15,595
这发生在伽利略号飞临伊欧的北极上空时
It happened when Galileo flew over Io's north pole.

527
00:30:21,344 --> 00:30:24,439
在太阳系里，我特别喜欢的卫星是木卫一伊欧
- My favorite moon in the solar system is Jupiter's moon Io.

528
00:30:24,587 --> 00:30:26,150
它看起来很象比萨饼
It looks a lot like a pizza.

529
00:30:27,222 --> 00:30:30,412
它是整个太阳系里活动最猛烈的卫星
This is the most volcanically active moon in the entire solar system,

530
00:30:30,709 --> 00:30:33,296
比地球的活动猛烈10到100倍
10 or 100 times more volcanically active than the Earth.

531
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:36,080
它每秒向太空喷发
It literally spews tons of material

532
00:30:36,093 --> 00:30:37,755
数以吨计的
into space every second-

533
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,709
硫磺和氧原子
sulfur and oxygen atoms.

534
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:43,147
这些物质在木星磁场里成为离子
These get ionized in Jupiter's magnetic field

535
00:30:43,363 --> 00:30:45,383
并反过来影响木星
and actually connect back to Jupiter,

536
00:30:45,396 --> 00:30:48,275
在其南北极产生环状物
to the north and south poles, making a doughnut.

537
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:52,598
这个环状物被称为木卫一磁流管
narrator: The doughnut is called the Io flux tube,

538
00:30:52,666 --> 00:30:55,889
带电粒子在木星和活动猛烈的卫星之间
and the charged particles carry a monster electric current

539
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:58,442
产生巨大的电流
between Jupiter and its volcanic moon.

540
00:30:59,942 --> 00:31:01,726
在伽利略号穿越它的时候...
As Galileo flew through it...

541
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:05,777
声音骤然而来，嘎然而止
The sound ended as abruptly as it started.

542
00:31:15,543 --> 00:31:18,394
木星和其卫星的演出告一段落
With Jupiter and its moons finishing their acts,

543
00:31:19,489 --> 00:31:21,570
我们的倒数对象，这次是土星
our countdown swings to Saturn,

544
00:31:21,773 --> 00:31:25,056
它虽比木星小，但也能入围十大金曲榜
smaller than Jupiter but right up there in the top ten.

545
00:31:25,692 --> 00:31:29,278
这个带光环的行星名列第四位
The ringed planet comes in at number four on the list.

546
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:33,278
请仔细听“土星的超现实声音”
Listen up for the "Surreal Sounds of Saturn."

547
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:38,560
它们是卡西尼号航天器传给我们的
They come to us from the Cassini spacecraft,

548
00:31:38,819 --> 00:31:41,646
卡西尼号在2004年到达这个行星后
which has been delivering mind-blowing pictures and data

549
00:31:41,973 --> 00:31:45,473
传回了许多令人兴奋的照片和数据
since its arrival at the ringed planet in 2004.

550
00:31:47,757 --> 00:31:49,988
就象旅行者号和伽利略号一样
As on Voyager and Galileo,

551
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:53,020
卡西尼号的等离子体波器
Cassini's plasma wave instrument is our proxy

552
00:31:53,141 --> 00:31:55,141
充当了我们人类在太空里的耳朵
for human ears in space.

553
00:31:58,074 --> 00:32:00,682
- 从卡西尼号的无线电和等离子体波器
- The eerie and bizarre sounds we hear from

554
00:32:00,695 --> 00:32:03,087
所听到的声音怪诞奇异
Cassini's radio and plasma-wave instrument

555
00:32:03,641 --> 00:32:05,195
让我们犹如置身于万圣节前夕
make me think of Halloween.

556
00:32:08,471 --> 00:32:11,918
它们起源于远比地球极光小得多的土星极光
They're due to the aurora on Saturn, very similar to Earth's aurora.

557
00:32:14,782 --> 00:32:16,904
你的耳朵永远听不出这些频率
Your ears could never pick up these frequencies,

558
00:32:16,958 --> 00:32:19,323
但把它们转换到一定范围后
but we move them into a range, and when we do,

559
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:22,747
我们会吃惊于它们是多么的怪诞和奇异
we were surprised to see how eerie and scary they actually were.

560
00:32:29,774 --> 00:32:31,437
“土星的超现实声音”
narrator: The "Surreal Sounds of Saturn"

561
00:32:31,464 --> 00:32:34,442
不是这个带光环的行星唯一的上榜金曲
isn't the ringed planet's only song on the countdown.

562
00:32:36,524 --> 00:32:39,915
紧接着的金曲榜第三名是
Turn it over, and we find number three on the playlist:

563
00:32:40,415 --> 00:32:42,294
“土星的另一面”
"Saturn's Flip Side."

564
00:32:45,516 --> 00:32:48,191
科学家称这首歌曲为“交叉”
Scientists call this hit a crossover.

565
00:32:48,935 --> 00:32:52,597
这首“交叉”与音乐风格毫无关系
This crossover has nothing to do with mixing musical styles

566
00:32:53,529 --> 00:32:55,056
只是对土星南北半球
but describes radio waves

567
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:57,543
无线电波波型的描述
from Saturn's northern and southern hemispheres,

568
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:01,562
它们在一个时间周期内会发生频率交叉
as they actually crisscross in frequency over a period of time.

569
00:33:04,211 --> 00:33:06,724
我们在无线电数据、等离子体波数据中
- We saw something really strange in our radio data,

570
00:33:06,738 --> 00:33:08,468
发现相互交叉的一对频率
in our plasma-wave data-

571
00:33:08,616 --> 00:33:10,738
这非常奇怪
a couple of crossing frequencies

572
00:33:11,224 --> 00:33:13,332
似乎暗示着南北半球
that apparently suggested that the northern

573
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:16,157
在以不同速率旋转
and southern hemispheres were rotating at different rates.

574
00:33:16,433 --> 00:33:18,994
这在我们固体地球上很不寻常
That's very unfamiliar to us on a solid Earth,

575
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,811
地球是以一个速率旋转的
where the Earth rotates at one rate.

576
00:33:22,095 --> 00:33:23,798
不过，我们不认为
It actually turns out we don't think

577
00:33:23,825 --> 00:33:25,365
土星是以不同的速率在旋转
Saturn's rotating at different rates.

578
00:33:25,392 --> 00:33:28,966
我们认为，高空处的西风带蒙骗了我们
We think that high-altitude zonal winds are tricking us

579
00:33:28,979 --> 00:33:31,655
让我们以为南北半球的
and making us think that there's different rotation

580
00:33:31,668 --> 00:33:33,170
旋转速率不同
in the northern and southern hemisphere,

581
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:34,520
但实情并非如此
but it's probably not the case.

582
00:33:39,168 --> 00:33:40,114
类似的波
narrator: Similar waves,

583
00:33:40,236 --> 00:33:42,851
沿着土星磁场路线分布
following the lines of Saturn's magnetic field,

584
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,850
揭露了这个带光环行星的一个神奇现象
revealed a surprise about the ringed planet.

585
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:49,812
卡西尼号所发现的最离奇事情之一是
- One of the most bizarre things that Cassini found

586
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:51,188
土星的一天
was apparently the Saturn day

587
00:33:51,215 --> 00:33:54,728
比数十年前旅行者号探测到的
was about six minutes longer than it was back in the days of Voyager,

588
00:33:54,742 --> 00:33:56,106
长了6分钟
mere decades earlier.

589
00:33:56,174 --> 00:33:58,529
土星一天的时间长度
The determination of the length of Saturn's day

590
00:33:58,612 --> 00:34:02,099
不能通过观察它周围的云层来测量
is actually not possible by watching the clouds rotate around the planet.

591
00:34:02,356 --> 00:34:05,491
我们只能使用射电辐射这些太空声音
We have to use these radio emissions, the sounds of space,

592
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:07,693
来观察内部深层的运行情况
to see what the deep interior is doing.

593
00:34:07,869 --> 00:34:09,720
去发现其中奥秘
And that's where we found this mystery.

594
00:34:13,186 --> 00:34:16,050
让土星这样块头的行星
narrator: It's virtually impossible to slow down a planet

595
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:19,429
停滞哪怕一瞬间，那是不可能的
the size of Saturn that much in such a short time.

596
00:34:20,415 --> 00:34:22,348
所以科学家们认识到
So scientists now realize

597
00:34:22,375 --> 00:34:25,921
射电辐射很可能给不出清晰的照片
the radio emissions probably don't give an accurate picture.

598
00:34:27,056 --> 00:34:29,921
靠着对土星风图的精确测绘
And by sophisticated mapping of Saturn's winds,

599
00:34:30,164 --> 00:34:32,726
他们现在已经知道
they now have a better take on Saturn's day,

600
00:34:33,043 --> 00:34:37,800
土星的一天是10小时34分钟13秒
which happens to be 10 hours, 34 minutes, and 13 seconds long.

601
00:34:42,035 --> 00:34:44,617
现在，我们正在接近土卫六泰坦
Now we're closing in on the surface of Titan,

602
00:34:45,035 --> 00:34:46,330
它是土星最大的卫星
Saturn's biggest moon,

603
00:34:46,549 --> 00:34:49,467
也进入了我们的外域声音排行榜
as it swings into the Alien Sounds Countdown.

604
00:34:49,805 --> 00:34:53,041
位居第二的是“非常泰坦”
Hit number two rings out as "Totally Titan."

605
00:34:54,365 --> 00:34:56,716
它以超自然的嘶嘶声作为开始
And it opens with an otherworldly hiss

606
00:34:56,798 --> 00:34:59,622
是卡西尼号在远离地球约十亿英里的地方
from an actual microphone on the Huygens lander,

607
00:34:59,784 --> 00:35:01,129
所释放的惠更斯号登陆车
separated from Cassini

608
00:35:01,216 --> 00:35:03,803
在挂着降落伞穿过泰坦的甲烷大气层时
and parachuting through Titan's methane atmosphere,

609
00:35:04,108 --> 00:35:06,722
车上的麦克风所捕捉到的
nearly a billion miles away from Earth.

610
00:35:08,276 --> 00:35:10,142
在跳伞中，你会听到...
- If you're parachuting, you're going to hear...

611
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:14,856
这正是我们在惠更斯号上听到的声音
That's exactly what we hear in these Huygens sounds.

612
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,890
在2005年，在登陆车冲向泰坦表面的时候
narrator: The sound was transmitted as the lander headed

613
00:35:20,904 --> 00:35:23,796
这些声音被传送回来
toward Titan's surface in 2005.

614
00:35:26,471 --> 00:35:29,782
惠更斯号上的声敏元件其实就是麦克风
- The acoustic sensor on Huygens was essentially a microphone,

615
00:35:29,917 --> 00:35:33,166
但它是每隔2秒才取样
but it only sampled every couple seconds.

616
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:36,045
它会短促地捕获声音--细小细小的声音
It would take a little sound- tiny, tiny sound bite

617
00:35:36,112 --> 00:35:38,801
接着无声，然后又是细小细小的声音
and then nothing and then a tiny, tiny sound bite.

618
00:35:38,964 --> 00:35:43,747
它没有被计划为普通人听的声音
It wasn't planned to turn that into sounds that the public could hear.

619
00:35:48,361 --> 00:35:50,469
与其它从土星而来的声音不同
narrator: But unlike the other sounds from Saturn,

620
00:35:50,645 --> 00:35:53,064
这些并不是转换自无线电波
these were not converted from radio waves.

621
00:35:54,064 --> 00:35:58,145
它们是泰坦甲烷大气层里的真实声波
They began as true sound waves in Titan's methane atmosphere,

622
00:35:58,726 --> 00:36:03,658
行星学会把从麦克风而来的声音样本进行转换
and The Planetary Society stepped in to convert the staccato sampling of the microphone

623
00:36:03,705 --> 00:36:06,313
让人们能听得到
into something audible to human ears.

624
00:36:08,272 --> 00:36:11,124
- 最后，听到的多半是
- In the end, what you hear is mostly wind noise

625
00:36:11,245 --> 00:36:14,085
降落伞穿过大气层时的风噪声
as the parachute's descending through the atmosphere.

626
00:36:14,224 --> 00:36:16,922
然后声音非常非常小
And then things get much, much quieter on the surface.

627
00:36:16,981 --> 00:36:18,062
它从...
It goes from...

628
00:36:20,576 --> 00:36:21,724
突然变成...
To suddenly being...

629
00:36:26,792 --> 00:36:31,000
至关紧要的是，我们听到的声音
But what's really profound is, we're hearing sounds

630
00:36:31,216 --> 00:36:33,225
是由一个十亿英里外的声敏元件
taken by an actual acoustic sensor

631
00:36:33,635 --> 00:36:35,243
所捕捉到的
from a billion miles away.

632
00:36:35,365 --> 00:36:39,325
这是我们首次听到来自于别的行星
First time we've ever heard sounds from another planet

633
00:36:39,581 --> 00:36:41,682
或来自于其卫星的声音
or moon around another planet.

634
00:36:44,168 --> 00:36:47,925
但是，这急速的风声并不是从惠更斯号传来的唯一声音
narrator: But the rushing wind wasn't the only sound coming from Huygens.

635
00:36:48,736 --> 00:36:52,263
在登陆车冲向泰坦表面的时候
As data streamed in from the lander on the way to Titan's surface,

636
00:36:52,709 --> 00:36:56,242
控制室里极度紧张的工程师们屏息以待
white-knuckled engineers in Mission Control held their breath,

637
00:36:57,106 --> 00:37:00,809
希望这艘无畏的航天器会安全着陆
hoping the intrepid spacecraft would make its landing safely.

638
00:37:02,323 --> 00:37:04,169
这个故事的最后篇章
The final chapter in the story

639
00:37:04,363 --> 00:37:07,079
是一个不可思议的音乐视频
is told in an incredible music video

640
00:37:07,174 --> 00:37:10,369
保证让你觉得非常刺激
guaranteed to keep you on the edge of your seat.

641
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:23,956
宇宙十大外域声音
We've been counting down the top ten alien sounds of the universe,

642
00:37:24,172 --> 00:37:26,780
我们已几乎倒数到了第一名
and we've almost reached number one.

643
00:37:28,226 --> 00:37:30,807
但首先，让我们回到第二名
But first we're shifting into high gear...

644
00:37:32,618 --> 00:37:34,294
它有一曲副歌
as number two runs with

645
00:37:34,321 --> 00:37:37,023
其来自于惠更斯航天器
an astronomical riff from the Huygens space probe

646
00:37:37,037 --> 00:37:39,313
当时航天器在拜访土星最大的卫星...
visiting Saturn's largest moon...

647
00:37:40,353 --> 00:37:41,367
泰坦
Titan.

648
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:46,110
它是唯一一个拥有音乐视频的声音
It's the only alien sound that comes with its own music video.

649
00:37:47,921 --> 00:37:49,347
注意了
Look and listen.

650
00:37:49,624 --> 00:37:52,900
所以说，第二名“非常泰坦”分为两部分
Cut two on number two- it's "Totally Titan."

651
00:37:56,819 --> 00:37:59,846
我们称之为来自于“卡西尼-惠更斯号”的
- Here we have what's called the bells and whistles movie

652
00:38:00,089 --> 00:38:01,734
动感电影
from Cassini-Huygens,

653
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:03,581
它展示了下降的过程
and it's showing the descent,

654
00:38:04,284 --> 00:38:07,149
是利用声音去传递各种不同数据的
and it's a great example of using sound

655
00:38:07,176 --> 00:38:10,114
一个极好例子
to convey all sorts of different kinds of data.

656
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,455
正如盖格计数器
narrator: Just as a Geiger counter

657
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:17,541
用听得到的喀哒声来报告放射性
announces radioactivity using audible clicks,

658
00:38:17,911 --> 00:38:21,344
在惠更斯登陆车上的仪器也会发出声音
the instruments on the Huygens lander were given their own sounds

659
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:23,817
来表明自己的状态
to register the measurements they were taking.

660
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:31,677
- 你听到的韵律声- 每一下都意味着
- Those chimes you hear- each one of those means

661
00:38:31,749 --> 00:38:33,633
仪器或是正在照相
that an instrument was taking a picture

662
00:38:33,647 --> 00:38:35,268
或是在捕获其它数据
or some other kind of data.

663
00:38:35,309 --> 00:38:37,395
不同的仪器有不同的声响
Different instruments are a different chime.

664
00:38:37,579 --> 00:38:40,936
我们也会听到背景杂音
We also are hearing a kind of a hum in the background.

665
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:44,363
那是因为在与卡西尼号通信
That's the signal strength to the Cassini spacecraft.

666
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,612
我们发现，有一个嘀嘀声一闪而过
We've got a ticking that occurs

667
00:38:46,734 --> 00:38:49,247
这与航天器的旋转有关
that has to do with the spinning and rotation of the spacecraft.

668
00:38:49,274 --> 00:38:51,963
每旋转一次，就会有这个嘀嘀声
Every time it rotates once, they have the tick.

669
00:38:53,828 --> 00:38:56,815
虽然这是科学仪器的大合唱
narrator: Though it's just an assembly of pure scientific information,

670
00:38:57,193 --> 00:38:59,767
这个视频似乎在原汁原味地展现
the video seems to preserve what must have been

671
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:02,185
扣人心弦的最后时刻...
those last moments of high tension...

672
00:39:03,699 --> 00:39:06,337
任务控制室内的科学家们想知道
when the scientists in Mission Control wondered,

673
00:39:06,564 --> 00:39:09,037
“这个小不点航天器会安全着陆”
"Will the tiny spacecraft land safely,

674
00:39:09,172 --> 00:39:10,875
“还是会撞毁？”
or will it crash?"

675
00:39:15,097 --> 00:39:18,353
- 开始啦，差不多了...
- So here we go, and almost down...

676
00:39:19,056 --> 00:39:21,516
然后...
and then...

677
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:23,759
着陆了
and we're landed.

678
00:39:25,894 --> 00:39:27,927
在十亿英里外的一片声响中...
narrator: Mission accomplished...

679
00:39:28,711 --> 00:39:31,454
任务完成了
with sound a billion miles away.

680
00:39:35,886 --> 00:39:37,494
第二名的“非常泰坦”
"Totally Titan" has been a thrill

681
00:39:37,521 --> 00:39:39,328
让我们激动万分
at number two on the countdown,

682
00:39:39,595 --> 00:39:43,284
现在，让我们在唱片机上播放神秘的第一名...
but now we spin the platter on the mysterious number one...

683
00:39:46,365 --> 00:39:49,257
这首歌曲的发源地
A song that comes from a place totally unlike

684
00:39:49,284 --> 00:39:52,527
在我们所认识的宇宙中，与别处绝然不同
anything else in the universe we've ever encountered.

685
00:39:54,033 --> 00:39:57,830
正如从木星和土星而来的信号
While some remind us of the strange signals from Jupiter and Saturn,

686
00:39:58,438 --> 00:40:00,395
这首歌曲的声音也让我们奇怪之至
there are also sounds in this song

687
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,140
它完全不同于我们曾测量过的东西
that are completely different from anything we've measured

688
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:06,322
也不同于我们在宇宙其它地方曾发现的东西...
or detected anywhere else in the cosmos...

689
00:40:09,674 --> 00:40:11,572
这是因为第一名
because number one on the countdown

690
00:40:11,647 --> 00:40:14,404
虽在外面的整个宇宙里回响
has sounds alien to the entire universe,

691
00:40:14,687 --> 00:40:17,282
但偏偏把它的发源地排除在外
except for the place where they originate.

692
00:40:18,066 --> 00:40:20,411
宇宙金曲的第一名
Number one in the universe's greatest hits

693
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:23,166
是一个特别地方的回响
resounds with echoes of a singular place.

694
00:40:24,544 --> 00:40:27,207
它就是“地球回声”
"The Echoes of Earth."

695
00:40:39,591 --> 00:40:42,915
在地球，我们习惯地认为
- Here on Earth, we're used to thinking of the alien sounds

696
00:40:42,929 --> 00:40:45,685
外域声音是来自于我们星球之外
as being everything that comes from beyond our planet,

697
00:40:45,942 --> 00:40:49,314
它应当象穿透天文物理介质或物体的
and that might be examples of plasma waves

698
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:52,975
等离子波和压力这些东西
and pressure moving through astrophysical media or objects.

699
00:40:53,461 --> 00:40:57,326
但实际上，如果你从远方观察我们的地球
But, really, if you think about observing our Earth from afar,

700
00:40:57,799 --> 00:40:59,195
外星人就是我们
the aliens are us.

701
00:40:59,394 --> 00:41:00,663
我们的声音独一无二
And our sounds are unique,

702
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:03,329
因为它来自于活着的生物
because they come from living organisms,

703
00:41:03,467 --> 00:41:05,089
它是人类的语言...
whether it be human language...

704
00:41:07,332 --> 00:41:08,535
或是鸟儿的歌
Or bird songs.

705
00:41:13,751 --> 00:41:16,261
外域探测器扫描地球表面时
narrator: An alien probe exploring Earth space

706
00:41:16,311 --> 00:41:19,135
肯定会捕获到与木星或土星相类似的
would certainly pick up the Jupiter- or Saturn-like sounds

707
00:41:19,149 --> 00:41:22,514
带电粒子因被地球磁场推动而产生的声音
of charged particles propelled by Earth's magnetic field.

708
00:41:25,257 --> 00:41:27,189
但我们的行星，与众不同的是
But our planet, unlike the others,

709
00:41:27,324 --> 00:41:29,257
还会发出无线电波
also emits radio waves,

710
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,249
在宇宙里昭告人类的存在
broadcast into the cosmos by human beings.

711
00:41:40,979 --> 00:41:44,498
晚上好，我是雷吉纳德 A. 费森登教授
- Good evening, this is Professor Reginald A. Fessenden,

712
00:41:44,768 --> 00:41:47,349
在马萨诸塞州的布兰特洛克镇和你说话
speaking to you from Brant Rock, Massachusetts.

713
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:51,620
1906年，在马萨诸塞州的布兰特洛克镇
narrator: In 1906, at Brant Rock, Massachusetts,

714
00:41:51,998 --> 00:41:54,917
雷吉纳德.费森登首次利用无线电
Reginald Fessenden made the first radio broadcast

715
00:41:54,958 --> 00:41:56,674
广播了声乐节目
of speech and music.

716
00:41:57,990 --> 00:42:00,585
费森登是调幅(AM)广播的发明者
Fessenden was the inventor of AM radio,

717
00:42:00,653 --> 00:42:03,801
他在圣诞前夕进行了首次信号传送
transmitting his first signals on Christmas Eve.

718
00:42:05,855 --> 00:42:09,558
信号被水手们在数百英里外的海洋上捕捉到
It was picked up by sailors hundreds of miles out at sea

719
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:14,010
并从此贯穿太空
and has been traveling through space ever since.

720
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:16,685
自从有了无线电
- Ever since the beginning of radio,

721
00:42:16,712 --> 00:42:19,158
我们一直在向太空发出广播
we've really been broadcasting out into space.

722
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:21,486
我们所发送的这些信号
And we've been sending out these signals,

723
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:23,783
希望有某些人会截获到
in the hopes that somebody will intercept them.

724
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,907
当然，太空实在太大了
Of course, space is a very large place,

725
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:27,704
所以，难以知道
and, therefore, it's hard to know

726
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:29,488
谁会在什么时候收到它们
who would have gotten them and when,

727
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:32,921
但他们会在那里，尽管谁也不知道是哪里
but there they are on their way out to who knows where.

728
00:42:36,164 --> 00:42:38,928
地球上的小孩在向您打招呼
- Hello from the children of Planet Earth.

729
00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:40,717
（日语女声）
[woman speaking Japanese]

730
00:42:40,778 --> 00:42:43,251
地球上的声音也在太空里传送着
narrator: Earthly sounds are also traveling through space,

731
00:42:43,292 --> 00:42:47,156
但靠的不是无线电，而是装载在稳步迈向太空深处的...
not by radio, but aboard the two Voyager space probes...

732
00:42:47,994 --> 00:42:51,048
两艘旅行者号上的探测仪
on a slow but steady course to the stars.

733
00:42:51,792 --> 00:42:53,459
（法语）大家早上好
- Bonjour, tout le monde.

734
00:42:54,365 --> 00:42:57,351
对地球上的我们来说，声音很重要
- One of the examples of how important sound is

735
00:42:57,365 --> 00:43:00,716
所以，在发射旅行者号的时候
to us here on Earth is that when we launched Voyager,

736
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:05,068
我们放上了一张录有地球声音的黄金唱片
we actually included a golden record of sounds from our Earth.

737
00:43:05,405 --> 00:43:08,200
其中不仅有人类的声音
And this was to represent not only human sound

738
00:43:08,263 --> 00:43:11,965
还有许多同在地球生活的生物的声音
but also sounds of the many creatures that live here on Earth with us.

739
00:43:12,303 --> 00:43:15,736
所以，它实际上是地球生命的声学指纹
So it's really a sound fingerprint of life on our planet.

740
00:43:16,188 --> 00:43:21,188

741
00:43:21,309 --> 00:43:22,782
我们以自己的方式
narrator: As we take our own place

742
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:25,228
对十大声音进行的探讨
among the top ten hits in our playlist,

743
00:43:26,525 --> 00:43:29,262
对响荡在虚空里的太空声音来说
we realize they only scratch the surface

744
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:32,322
其实很肤浅
of the cosmic voices calling out in the void.

745
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:35,409
从创世至今
From creation to the present day,

746
00:43:36,031 --> 00:43:39,151
宇宙产生了数不胜数的声音
space has produced a broad catalog of sounds

747
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:41,342
为它的壮丽景色伴奏
to accompany its brilliant sights.

748
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:45,544
这些各种各样的声音似乎很怪异
As strange as these many sounds seem,

749
00:43:45,896 --> 00:43:48,780
但我们知道，它们携带着重要信息
we've learned that they carry important messages,

750
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,766
能帮助我们去解开自然之谜
helping to solve mysteries of nature

751
00:43:52,266 --> 00:43:56,334
让我们最大程度地去了解宇宙
and our ultimate understanding of the universe.

752
