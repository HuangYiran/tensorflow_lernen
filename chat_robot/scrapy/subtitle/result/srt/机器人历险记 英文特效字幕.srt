00:01:15,707 --> 00:01:19,040
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just talked to my wife. My baby's gonna be delivered any minute.

00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:45,500

{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm here. I'm here.

00:01:53,011 --> 00:01:54,884
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You missed the delivery.

22
00:01:56,047 --> 00:01:57,150
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's okay. Making the baby's the fun part.

00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:01,243


24
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:11,336

00:02:20,188 --> 00:02:22,513
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honey, I think you've got the wrong...

26
00:02:23,124 --> 00:02:26,243
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I don't need to see the directions.

27
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:43,435
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Push, push.

28
00:02:43,511 --> 00:02:45,135
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Push!

00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:00,190
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Twelve hours of labor.

00:03:00,328 --> 00:03:02,166
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, but it was worth it.

31
00:03:02,263 --> 00:03:04,588
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at him. Look at him.

32
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:07,166
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rodney Copperbottom.

00:03:07,268 --> 00:03:09,841
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's got your mom's eyes and my dad's nose.

34
00:03:09,904 --> 00:03:12,335
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I knew we were smart to save those parts.

35
00:03:12,407 --> 00:03:15,811
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This Copperbottom will do great things for the world, I can feel it.

36
00:03:15,843 --> 00:03:17,230
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Honey? - What?

37
00:03:17,345 --> 00:03:19,491
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's that extra piece?

38
00:03:19,847 --> 00:03:23,108
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no, they always put in an extra...

39
00:03:23,885 --> 00:03:25,961
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We did want a boy, right?

40
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:31,115
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This won't hurt a bit, son.

41
00:03:38,633 --> 00:03:40,614
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Got your nose. Got your nose.

42
00:03:40,736 --> 00:03:42,467
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Got your...

43
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,802


44
00:03:54,515 --> 00:03:58,192


45
00:04:03,725 --> 00:04:05,836
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hi, son. - Are those my big-boy parts?

46
00:04:05,927 --> 00:04:07,623
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They sure are.

47
00:04:10,064 --> 00:04:12,210
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're not shiny.

48
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:16,187
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, they're not brand-new. They're preowned. So...

49
00:04:16,237 --> 00:04:20,056
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're hand-me-downs from your cousin Jeffrey.

50
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:21,697
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And they're only for a year.

51
00:04:26,981 --> 00:04:30,764


52
00:04:48,235 --> 00:04:50,417
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Dad, who's that?

53
00:04:50,504 --> 00:04:52,935
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That, Rodney, is Bigweld.

54
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,257
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The greatest robot in the world.

55
00:04:55,376 --> 00:04:58,400
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought you were the greatest robot in the world.

56
00:04:58,447 --> 00:05:00,143
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, besides me.

57
00:05:00,247 --> 00:05:02,156
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's the head of Bigweld Industries.

58
00:05:02,283 --> 00:05:05,544
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He invents things that make everyone's life better.

59
00:05:05,653 --> 00:05:08,772
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Could I meet him? - Sure, maybe someday.

60
00:05:08,856 --> 00:05:10,243
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Dad? - Yeah?

61
00:05:10,357 --> 00:05:14,319
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What do you do? - Me? I work in a big, fancy restaurant.

62
00:05:14,361 --> 00:05:16,792
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm a dishwasher.

63
00:05:21,602 --> 00:05:25,635
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And now, live from Robot City, it's The Bigweld Show.

64
00:05:27,274 --> 00:05:29,147
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah!

65
00:05:29,477 --> 00:05:32,394
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Dad, you're missing it.

66
00:05:32,446 --> 00:05:35,043
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, Rodney. All right, I'm coming. I'm coming.

67
00:05:35,117 --> 00:05:37,584
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I had to bring work home with me again, I'm sorry.

68
00:05:37,685 --> 00:05:39,701
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Gunk has really been piling it on.

69
00:05:39,787 --> 00:05:43,915
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And now, the host of our show, Bigweld.

70
00:05:43,924 --> 00:05:48,609
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Welcome. This week I thought you'd like to take a look around Bigweld Industries.

71
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:52,757
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This here is the front gate. Kind of cute, ain 't it?

72
00:05:54,635 --> 00:05:58,039
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Good morning, Tim. - Good morning, Mr. Bigweld, sir.

73
00:05:58,105 --> 00:06:00,216
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tim, who closed the front gate?

74
00:06:00,341 --> 00:06:02,701
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I just thought since...

75
00:06:03,277 --> 00:06:05,814
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We never shut the gate, Tim.

76
00:06:05,913 --> 00:06:09,211
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shutting this gate means shutting out fresh ideas.

77
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,954
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See, every day, robots come here from hither and yon...

78
00:06:12,019 --> 00:06:14,344
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...bringing us new ideas.

79
00:06:15,423 --> 00:06:18,649
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I listen to every single one of them.

80
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:28,602
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So remember, whether a bot is made of new parts, old parts or spare parts...

81
00:06:28,602 --> 00:06:31,448
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...you can shine no matter what you're made of.

82
00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:33,685
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's talking to me, Dad.

83
00:06:33,774 --> 00:06:36,763
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He sure is, son. He sure is.

84
00:06:36,811 --> 00:06:40,393
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, folks, let's get to inventing.

85
00:06:44,385 --> 00:06:46,258
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, I love to tinker...

86
00:06:46,387 --> 00:06:51,701
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but all the tinkering in the world isn 't useful unless it starts with a good idea.

87
00:06:53,627 --> 00:06:59,265
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So look around for a need and start coming up with ideas to fill that need.

88
00:06:59,266 --> 00:07:03,120
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One idea will lead to another, and before you know it...

89
00:07:04,905 --> 00:07:08,510
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...you've done it. See a need, fill a need.

90
00:07:08,576 --> 00:07:12,181
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's it, Dad. I have to look for...

91
00:07:14,882 --> 00:07:16,376
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...a need.

92
00:07:29,163 --> 00:07:30,550
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Easy, now.

93
00:07:46,047 --> 00:07:49,202
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hey there, sport. - Oh, hi.

94
00:07:49,316 --> 00:07:52,340
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These are your 12-year-old parts. They're...

95
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:55,160
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hand-me-downs. I know, Dad.

96
00:07:55,222 --> 00:07:58,448
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I don't mind. - They are from your cousin...

97
00:07:58,525 --> 00:07:59,983
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...Veronica.

98
00:08:00,094 --> 00:08:02,834
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know how popular she is.

99
00:08:09,403 --> 00:08:10,790


100
00:08:10,905 --> 00:08:13,645


101
00:08:28,656 --> 00:08:30,423
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks.

102
00:08:33,427 --> 00:08:36,024


103
00:08:44,071 --> 00:08:45,494
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, hey. Hey.

104
00:08:46,573 --> 00:08:50,641
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Soon as you reach the age where your warranty expires, you start falling apart.

105
00:08:50,678 --> 00:08:53,275
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pretty soon there's gonna be more duct tape than me.

106
00:08:53,381 --> 00:08:56,891
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Can I try it now, Dad? - Oh, Rodney...

107
00:08:56,951 --> 00:09:01,114
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Have you worked all the kinks out of it? - This is gonna make your job easy.

108
00:09:01,155 --> 00:09:03,231
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I invented it for you.

109
00:09:06,027 --> 00:09:07,971
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Let's try it.

110
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:10,906
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great. Okay, this is it.

111
00:09:10,965 --> 00:09:14,642
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wonderbot, go to work.

112
00:09:28,182 --> 00:09:29,913
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, yeah.

113
00:09:39,727 --> 00:09:40,830
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey!

114
00:10:09,724 --> 00:10:11,313
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Copperbottom!

115
00:10:11,492 --> 00:10:12,879
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Mr. Gunk. - What is that?

116
00:10:12,994 --> 00:10:15,983
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh, that. My son made it. - What's it doing?

117
00:10:16,063 --> 00:10:20,191
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Gunk, please, you're making it nervous.

118
00:10:20,234 --> 00:10:22,630
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's wrecking my kitchen!

119
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:26,339
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'll stop it. - No!

120
00:10:29,977 --> 00:10:31,329
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your son, huh?

121
00:10:31,512 --> 00:10:33,979
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It wasn't his fault. He had nothing to do with it.

122
00:10:34,048 --> 00:10:36,645
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, sir, he's a brilliant boy. An inventor.

123
00:10:36,751 --> 00:10:40,914
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You, clean up this mess. And, you, get out.

124
00:10:40,988 --> 00:10:42,340
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Inventor.

125
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:46,380
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're the hand-me-down son of a dishwasher, and that's all you'll ever be.

126
00:10:46,394 --> 00:10:51,115
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Somebody scrape this crud off of me. And serve it to the customers.

127
00:10:52,066 --> 00:10:53,453
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Roundtrip or one-way?

128
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,581
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One-way.

129
00:10:58,238 --> 00:11:01,879
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There you are. I told you I'd find him.

130
00:11:01,909 --> 00:11:05,622
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's a mother's instinct. - Instinct? He left us a note:

131
00:11:05,646 --> 00:11:08,219
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"I'm leaving. I'll be at the train station."

132
00:11:08,316 --> 00:11:11,056
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Never mind. Pick up that suitcase. You're coming home.

133
00:11:11,152 --> 00:11:15,589
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, Mom. I have to do this. I'm going to Robot City tonight.

134
00:11:15,589 --> 00:11:18,649
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna get a job and I'm gonna help Dad pay back Mr. Gunk.

135
00:11:18,725 --> 00:11:20,112
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Talk to him.

136
00:11:20,227 --> 00:11:23,180
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Ro... - Robot City? You're just a kid.

137
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:25,409
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm never gonna be someone here.

138
00:11:25,532 --> 00:11:28,343
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wanna be an inventor. I wanna meet Bigweld.

139
00:11:28,402 --> 00:11:29,860
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wanna be somebody.

140
00:11:30,037 --> 00:11:31,531
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are somebody.

141
00:11:31,638 --> 00:11:34,069
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Somebody who's not getting on that train.

142
00:11:34,174 --> 00:11:37,887
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yes, I am. - Talk to him.

143
00:11:40,581 --> 00:11:43,534
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- One ticket for Robot City. - Where are you going?

144
00:11:43,617 --> 00:11:46,878
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Not me. Him. - But...

145
00:11:46,954 --> 00:11:51,781
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rodney, did you know that when I was your age, I wanted to be a musician?

146
00:11:52,093 --> 00:11:54,381
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I played pretty well too...

147
00:11:54,462 --> 00:11:57,581
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but my dad was worried I wouldn't be able to make a living.

148
00:11:57,664 --> 00:12:01,768
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I got refitted to be a dishwasher. Now, I'm not complaining.

149
00:12:01,768 --> 00:12:04,923
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I've always said to myself...

150
00:12:05,473 --> 00:12:10,372
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...if I could do it over again, I would follow my dream.

151
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:13,566
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've got greatness in you, Rodney.

152
00:12:13,648 --> 00:12:15,237
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Never doubt it.

153
00:12:15,383 --> 00:12:17,364
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You go to Robot City.

154
00:12:17,451 --> 00:12:21,954
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You go meet Bigweld, and you show him your big ideas.

155
00:12:21,955 --> 00:12:23,342
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, Rodney...

156
00:12:23,457 --> 00:12:27,454
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...never, never give up.

157
00:12:27,494 --> 00:12:30,518


158
00:12:42,609 --> 00:12:45,420
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All aboard.

159

{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom.

160
00:13:02,663 --> 00:13:05,165
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I won't let you down, Dad.

161
00:13:05,232 --> 00:13:06,726
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll make you proud.

162
00:13:10,003 --> 00:13:11,805
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know you will.

163

166
00:14:07,128 --> 00:14:09,310
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Could you direct me to Bigweld Indust...?

167
00:14:09,397 --> 00:14:11,864
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What? - Perfect. That will be 50 bucks.

168
00:14:11,933 --> 00:14:13,285
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fifty bucks? For what?

169
00:14:13,401 --> 00:14:16,105
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A beautiful picture of your first moment in Robot City.

170
00:14:16,203 --> 00:14:18,420
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There. Your second moment. That's another $50.

171
00:14:18,572 --> 00:14:20,410
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you keeping track?

172
00:14:21,008 --> 00:14:24,198
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, work with me, work with me. More pout, less pose.

173
00:14:24,278 --> 00:14:27,338
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great. Inside of you is a fashion model waiting to throw up.

174
00:14:27,415 --> 00:14:30,890
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give me those eyes. Big eyes, big eyes. Give me big anime eyes.

175
00:14:31,953 --> 00:14:35,392
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah! Loving it, loving it, loving it! - I don't want any pictures.

176
00:14:35,455 --> 00:14:36,878
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You don't? - No.

177
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:41,023
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's all right. There's no film. Would you like a map to the stars' homes?

178
00:14:41,028 --> 00:14:42,830
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where did he go?

179
00:14:44,966 --> 00:14:47,990


180
00:14:53,341 --> 00:14:55,772

199
00:16:39,546 --> 00:16:43,259
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good luck in the big city. If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere.

200
00:16:43,351 --> 00:16:47,241
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And if you can't make it here, welcome to the club.

201
00:16:56,062 --> 00:16:57,342
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh, no. - What? What is it?

202
00:16:57,497 --> 00:16:59,478
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're going off the track. We're gonna crash!

203
00:16:59,599 --> 00:17:02,066
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What? - I don't wanna die.

204
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:16,170
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was just kidding. Just put your head between your legs.

205
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:24,583
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah!

207
00:17:50,183 --> 00:17:53,278
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I tell you, the things that fall off me... It's embarrassing.

208
00:18:13,341 --> 00:18:14,799
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry.

209
00:18:27,854 --> 00:18:31,495
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, it used to be a lot worse. They had this giant hammer...

210
00:18:31,525 --> 00:18:33,221
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, they brought it back.

211
00:18:56,983 --> 00:18:59,200
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stick with me. I know this town like the back of my hand.

212
00:18:59,287 --> 00:19:01,718
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, that's new.

213
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:22,678


214
00:19:23,578 --> 00:19:26,151
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me. Can I help you?

215
00:19:26,246 --> 00:19:27,977
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, l...

216
00:19:28,114 --> 00:19:33,285
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hey, you're Tim from the TV show. - That's me.

217
00:19:33,286 --> 00:19:34,673
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, hey, Tim.

218
00:19:34,789 --> 00:19:37,778
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who closed the gate? It's never supposed to be...

219
00:19:37,824 --> 00:19:39,282
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, okay, what do you want?

220
00:19:40,894 --> 00:19:43,254
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd like to see Mr. Bigweld.

221
00:19:43,331 --> 00:19:46,213
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm an inventor.

222
00:19:47,335 --> 00:19:49,932
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, why didn't you say so?

223
00:19:50,071 --> 00:19:52,217
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stand back.

224
00:20:09,689 --> 00:20:11,562
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks.

225
00:20:11,691 --> 00:20:13,244
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

226
00:20:13,493 --> 00:20:17,003
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got you. You see, because you were all excited and then, boom!

227
00:20:18,633 --> 00:20:21,752
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, I had my laugh. Go on in.

228
00:20:27,073 --> 00:20:28,769
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, that's funny.

229
00:20:29,609 --> 00:20:31,755
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The second time.

230
00:20:31,845 --> 00:20:36,471
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You really think I'm gonna let you in. But I'm not.

231
00:20:36,484 --> 00:20:39,437
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, kid, nobody gets in. Company rules.

232
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:42,817
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Company ru...? Well, then how do they hire new inventors?

233
00:20:42,889 --> 00:20:45,320
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They don't. Those days are over.

234
00:20:45,393 --> 00:20:49,805
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My advice: Come back two years ago. Then the job is yours.

235
00:21:03,009 --> 00:21:08,247
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So remember, whether a bot is made of new parts, old parts or spare parts...

236
00:21:08,248 --> 00:21:10,715
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...you can shine no matter what you're made of.

237
00:21:11,851 --> 00:21:15,456
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My goodness, what a remarkable legacy.

238
00:21:15,488 --> 00:21:18,512
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Concern for the common robot.

239
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:23,063
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't come across old-fashioned values like that anymore, friends.

240
00:21:23,064 --> 00:21:24,653
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And for good reason.

241
00:21:24,764 --> 00:21:26,780
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no money in it!

242
00:21:26,867 --> 00:21:30,864
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello? Memo to Bigweld: We're not a charity.

243
00:21:30,904 --> 00:21:34,130
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's why old fat face no longer sits in the big chair.

244
00:21:34,174 --> 00:21:35,727
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's a relic.

245
00:21:35,876 --> 00:21:40,324
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I don't wanna hear another, "Where's Bigweld?"

246
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:46,304
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll see him next month at the Bigweld Ball. He always goes to that.

247
00:21:49,055 --> 00:21:52,601
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, let's get down to the business of sucking every loose penny...

248
00:21:52,659 --> 00:21:55,778
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...out of Mr. And Mrs. Average-Knucklehead.

249
00:21:56,229 --> 00:21:57,616
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's our big-ticket item?

250
00:22:04,671 --> 00:22:07,031
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Upgrades, people. Upgrades.

251
00:22:07,274 --> 00:22:08,768
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's how we make the dough.

252
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:13,813
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, if we're telling robots that no matter what they're made of, they're "fine"...

253
00:22:13,813 --> 00:22:17,418
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...how can we expect them to feel crummy enough about themselves...

254
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:20,190
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...to buy our upgrades and make themselves look better?

255
00:22:20,287 --> 00:22:23,892
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Therefore, I've come up with a new slogan.

256
00:22:23,957 --> 00:22:27,705
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Why be you when you can be new?"

257
00:22:30,297 --> 00:22:33,108
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I gotta tell you, I think it's brilliant...

258
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:39,522
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but, honestly, I'd like to hear what you employees think about this.

259
00:22:39,706 --> 00:22:42,695
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hear, hear. - Out of the ballpark, Ratchet.

260
00:22:48,448 --> 00:22:50,144
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just don't look down.

261
00:23:01,261 --> 00:23:02,328
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey.

262
00:23:04,164 --> 00:23:05,895
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get off.

263
00:23:06,433 --> 00:23:08,164
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go on, get off.

264
00:23:09,936 --> 00:23:11,667
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get off of...

265
00:23:11,806 --> 00:23:14,581
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cappy, you haven't said a word.

266
00:23:14,641 --> 00:23:18,674
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It gave me chills. - Thank you, thank you.

267
00:23:18,745 --> 00:23:20,726
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- But... - But?

268
00:23:20,847 --> 00:23:24,975
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just wondering, why would robots buy new upgrades...

269
00:23:24,985 --> 00:23:27,760
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...if parts are so much cheaper?

270
00:23:27,822 --> 00:23:30,218
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, right. Well, that's easy.

271
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:35,495
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because as of today, we are no longer making spare parts.

272
00:23:35,495 --> 00:23:39,799
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you know what I call robots who can't afford upgrades? Scrap metal.

273
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:43,132
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see them on the streets, misshapen and rust-covered.

274
00:23:43,203 --> 00:23:48,074
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They turn your insides out. You wanna run home and scrub yourself.

275
00:23:48,074 --> 00:23:51,169
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, Cappy, I want your department to push our new slogan.

276
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:54,195
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In fact, I'm moving you into the office right next to mine.

277
00:23:54,281 --> 00:23:57,958
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll be working very, very closely together on this one.

278
00:23:57,984 --> 00:24:00,130
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Won't that be fun? - Oodles.

279
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:14,463
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh, so sorry, l... - What the...?

280
00:24:14,568 --> 00:24:21,107
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sir, I am a young inventor, and it has been my dream to come to Robot City...

281
00:24:21,107 --> 00:24:24,653
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and to present my ideas to Mr. Bigweld.

282
00:24:24,678 --> 00:24:26,409
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who doesn't seem to be here.

283
00:24:26,746 --> 00:24:31,265
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gee, no, no. But while he's away, he left me in charge.

284
00:24:31,318 --> 00:24:34,164
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, well, then let me show you what this can do.

285
00:24:34,721 --> 00:24:40,093
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have a better idea. Why don't you let me show you what it can do.

286
00:24:40,093 --> 00:24:41,480
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It can do this!

287
00:24:57,911 --> 00:24:59,784


288
00:25:03,583 --> 00:25:05,172
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So how did it go?

289
00:25:08,121 --> 00:25:11,726
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the heck is going on around here?

290
00:25:11,758 --> 00:25:16,550
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some highly polished jerk is sitting in Bigweld's chair.

291
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:21,258
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you're sitting on the sidewalk, magnetized.

292
00:25:21,301 --> 00:25:25,678
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, I'll be back, and I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.

293
00:25:25,739 --> 00:25:28,894
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When you pick a lost cause, you really commit.

294
00:25:28,942 --> 00:25:32,796
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where do they make dreamers like you? Get lost, freak!

295
00:26:36,576 --> 00:26:38,936


296
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:42,193
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, break time.

297
00:27:45,378 --> 00:27:47,489
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, break time's over.

298
00:27:47,581 --> 00:27:49,454
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chop-chop.

299
00:27:51,751 --> 00:27:53,375
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look who's here.

300
00:27:53,553 --> 00:27:57,550
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hi, Mom. - Hi, sweetie. How's my boy?

301
00:27:57,591 --> 00:28:02,062
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great. I did just what you told me. No more spare parts.

302
00:28:02,062 --> 00:28:06,332
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In a couple of weeks, those broken-down losers out there will be scrap metal.

303
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,352
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You will be up to your bloomers in broken-elbow junk.

304
00:28:09,436 --> 00:28:11,203
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Such a good boy.

305
00:28:11,304 --> 00:28:13,035
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And after you finish off Bigweld...

306
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,393
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...there will be nobody out there to fix them.

307
00:28:15,541 --> 00:28:17,617
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Exactly!

308
00:28:17,743 --> 00:28:19,819
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wanna swing that one by me again?

309
00:28:19,946 --> 00:28:23,385
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Idiot! Those outmodes look up to him.

310
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:27,127
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Suppose he decides to come back? - Oh, come on, Mom.

311
00:28:27,187 --> 00:28:30,733
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He's not gonna be trouble where he is. - What are you afraid of?

312
00:28:30,756 --> 00:28:32,143
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grow some bolts.

313
00:28:32,291 --> 00:28:34,864
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or do you want to end up like your father?

314
00:28:35,061 --> 00:28:37,421
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, son. Good to see you.

315
00:28:37,563 --> 00:28:39,057
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Think what it would mean.

316
00:28:39,166 --> 00:28:44,203
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not Bigweld Industries, Ratchet Industries.

317
00:28:44,203 --> 00:28:45,590
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keep talking.

318
00:28:45,705 --> 00:28:48,445
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ratchet City!

319
00:28:48,508 --> 00:28:51,663
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, everything shiny.

320
00:28:51,711 --> 00:28:55,839
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No more Bigweld, no more outmode.

321
00:28:55,849 --> 00:28:57,758
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's do it!

322
00:28:57,851 --> 00:29:00,033
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's my boy!

323
00:29:07,994 --> 00:29:10,105
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you hungry? Can I get you something?

324
00:29:10,197 --> 00:29:14,301
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You look thin. - No, no, no, Mom. I gotta go. Bye.

325
00:29:14,301 --> 00:29:15,510
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bye, Pop.

326
00:29:15,669 --> 00:29:18,788
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So long, son. Good luck with your dastardly plans.

327
00:29:42,863 --> 00:29:44,630
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey.

328
00:29:45,198 --> 00:29:46,894
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi there.

329
00:29:46,999 --> 00:29:53,251
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, if I seem to be getting smaller, it's because I'm leaving.

330
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,969
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Foot, don't fail me now.

331
00:29:55,142 --> 00:29:58,261
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop! Hey, you got my foot!

332
00:30:41,455 --> 00:30:44,337
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, great. Happy now?

333
00:30:44,423 --> 00:30:47,756
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not until you give me back my foot, you mugger.

334
00:30:47,828 --> 00:30:51,754
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am not a mugger. I happen to be...

335
00:30:51,765 --> 00:30:52,868
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...a scrounger.

336
00:30:53,065 --> 00:30:55,496
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't know you were at the end of that foot.

337
00:30:55,569 --> 00:30:58,000
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here, let me help you with that.

338
00:30:58,105 --> 00:30:59,658
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no, I'll do it myself.

339
00:30:59,773 --> 00:31:01,990
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have my pride, you know. Over here.

340
00:31:02,074 --> 00:31:05,751
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no. No, not that close. Hold on, hold on.

341
00:31:05,779 --> 00:31:07,546
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. No, no.

342
00:31:10,484 --> 00:31:13,366
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's the use? There's nothing left.

343
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:17,239
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Diesel, I found you a voice box.

344
00:31:22,129 --> 00:31:25,533


345
00:31:26,732 --> 00:31:28,084
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here's another one.

346
00:31:29,935 --> 00:31:32,046
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's no good. Give me that.

347
00:31:35,609 --> 00:31:37,969
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can never find parts in my size.

348
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,826
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is it, boy?

349
00:31:43,549 --> 00:31:46,086
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Fender, have you lost weight?

350
00:31:46,153 --> 00:31:48,264
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lost weight?

351
00:31:48,355 --> 00:31:51,865
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at where you're looking. He's a head in a basket.

352
00:31:51,892 --> 00:31:54,252
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're doomed, I knew it. We're doomed.

353
00:31:54,361 --> 00:31:58,524
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, will you shut up, you neurotic nut? Why, I'd smack you if I had a hand.

354
00:32:00,167 --> 00:32:02,148
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow, speak of the devil, here I come.

355
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:04,437
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dang!

356
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:07,226
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Check this out.

357
00:32:07,374 --> 00:32:11,157
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who would throw away such a cute little doodad?

358
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:14,124
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Don't be scared. - Hey, that's mine.

359
00:32:14,481 --> 00:32:17,707
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's him. That's the guy. I would know that face.

360
00:32:17,783 --> 00:32:20,772
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know that face, and I know that foot.

361
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,944
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's over there, moron.

362
00:32:23,055 --> 00:32:25,486
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's the perpetrator. He knocked my head off.

363
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:28,441
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You want another piece of me? - All right, buster.

364
00:32:28,495 --> 00:32:32,658
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you think you can mess with my big brother, you're... You're kind of cute.

365
00:32:32,998 --> 00:32:35,358
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Piper, would you behave yourself.

366
00:32:35,434 --> 00:32:38,351
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, come on, let's get Fender fixed. Again.

367
00:32:38,537 --> 00:32:41,039
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here's your thingamabob.

368
00:32:41,108 --> 00:32:43,468
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}By the way, the name's Piper.

369
00:32:43,542 --> 00:32:45,795
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rhymes with "viper."

370
00:32:46,947 --> 00:32:48,749
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See you around.

371
00:32:53,452 --> 00:32:55,705
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've told you a hundred times:

372
00:32:55,821 --> 00:32:58,109
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Don't talk to strange men." Thank you, Manuel.

373
00:32:58,225 --> 00:33:01,451
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I talk to you. Who's stranger than that?

374
00:33:04,029 --> 00:33:05,487


375
00:33:08,367 --> 00:33:11,771
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got good news, and I got bad news.

376
00:33:11,872 --> 00:33:14,339
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What's the bad news? - I checked the stock book.

377
00:33:14,408 --> 00:33:17,883
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And as of today, they are no longer making parts for your model.

378
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:20,650
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have been officially outmoded.

379
00:33:20,746 --> 00:33:22,335
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Outmoded? Well, that's fine.

380
00:33:22,449 --> 00:33:24,108
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's the good news?!

381
00:33:24,251 --> 00:33:29,257
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, when we had your parts, they were on sale.

382
00:33:34,126 --> 00:33:38,538
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How could this happen to me? I'm practically a kid.

383
00:33:38,564 --> 00:33:42,632
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, pull yourself together. All you need is an upgrade.

384
00:33:44,004 --> 00:33:46,779
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That new-upgrade smell.

385
00:33:46,907 --> 00:33:49,576
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just came in, fully loaded. Look.

386
00:33:49,675 --> 00:33:51,751
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's got cup-holders, standard.

387
00:33:51,912 --> 00:33:53,370
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Does it come in plus sizes?

388
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:58,343
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sure, take a look at the new Bigweld spring collection.

389
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:04,256
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't afford that fancy stuff. All I need is one stinking neck joint.

390
00:34:04,256 --> 00:34:07,660
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Why did this happen to me?

391
00:34:10,429 --> 00:34:12,611
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm hurting me. Idiot.

392
00:34:12,766 --> 00:34:16,407
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, pal, it's either upgrade or the chop shop for you.

393
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:18,237
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The chop shop?

394
00:34:18,971 --> 00:34:22,232
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm fine, I'm fine. Look, no hands.

395
00:34:25,911 --> 00:34:28,580
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ta-da! I'm back. Miss me?

396
00:34:28,682 --> 00:34:31,493
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No one's going to the chop shop. - That's right.

397
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:33,566
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you think we can get for him?

398
00:34:33,652 --> 00:34:36,225
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will you stop? Listen, shiny pants...

399
00:34:36,323 --> 00:34:38,920
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...you get back there and find a part for my brother.

400
00:34:38,991 --> 00:34:43,676
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are not junk, we are not scrap, and we will not be treated this way.

401
00:34:45,364 --> 00:34:47,237
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry. I don't have the parts.

402
00:34:47,334 --> 00:34:50,524
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, do you have two washers, an S-spring and some Fastweld?

403
00:34:50,569 --> 00:34:52,122
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can fix you easy.

404
00:34:54,473 --> 00:34:57,771
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Force is strong with this one.

405
00:35:08,889 --> 00:35:10,656
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When was the last time you got oiled?

406
00:35:10,956 --> 00:35:13,316
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't answer that with my kid sister here.

407
00:35:13,392 --> 00:35:14,779
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can it, Fender.

408
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,427
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold still. This might tickle.

409
00:35:17,496 --> 00:35:19,548
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We haven't been properly introduced.

410
00:35:19,665 --> 00:35:21,681
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm Fender. Used to be Bumper...

411
00:35:21,767 --> 00:35:24,364
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but had to change it when we came in to the country.

412
00:35:24,471 --> 00:35:26,167
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Copperbottom, Rodney Copperbottom.

413
00:35:26,338 --> 00:35:29,528
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Riddle me this: Why did I meet you among the garbage?

414
00:35:29,608 --> 00:35:32,277
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, today I tried to get in to see Bigweld.

415
00:35:33,212 --> 00:35:37,245
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, if you find him, tell him we really need him to come back.

416
00:35:37,284 --> 00:35:39,086
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He cared about bots like us.

417
00:35:39,218 --> 00:35:42,551
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I heard they've done him in and left the rest of us to fall apart.

418
00:35:43,089 --> 00:35:45,377
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, that ought to do it.

419
00:35:45,492 --> 00:35:49,275
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at that! And he fixed my neck.

420
00:35:49,296 --> 00:35:51,312
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Sweeper! - Sweeper?

421
00:35:51,932 --> 00:35:54,008
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Make yourself scarce.

422
00:36:00,106 --> 00:36:01,458
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's the big deal?

423
00:36:01,575 --> 00:36:05,608
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Well, if you're an outmode like Fender... - Hey.

424
00:36:05,644 --> 00:36:08,040
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They sweep you up and take you to the chop shop.

425
00:36:08,114 --> 00:36:12,918
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where they melt you down and turn you into something else.

426
00:36:12,918 --> 00:36:14,791
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You mean...?

427
00:36:15,621 --> 00:36:16,973
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yep.

428
00:36:17,089 --> 00:36:18,512
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sweepers. Sweepers.

429
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:22,527
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Help. Here's one outmode you're not gonna get.

430
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:31,986
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fender, run!

431
00:36:37,843 --> 00:36:39,681
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was close.

432
00:36:39,779 --> 00:36:42,411
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When in Robot City, guests of the Rusties... That's us.

433
00:36:42,481 --> 00:36:45,363
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Stay at Aunt Fanny's boarding house, where our motto is:

434
00:36:45,418 --> 00:36:47,955
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Beats rusting outside."

435
00:36:48,254 --> 00:36:52,452
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me just let her know you're here. Aunt Fanny!

436
00:36:52,491 --> 00:36:55,195
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We brought someone. - I'm in the kitchen.

437
00:36:55,261 --> 00:36:58,416
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Are you sure your aunt won't mind? - Relax, she's not my aunt.

438
00:36:58,465 --> 00:37:02,593
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She just takes in bots who are broke. Bless her little heart.

439
00:37:02,636 --> 00:37:04,747
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, then why is she called Aunt Fanny?

440
00:37:04,838 --> 00:37:06,534
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We couldn't call her Aunt Booty.

441
00:37:10,176 --> 00:37:11,729
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, crap.

442
00:37:11,845 --> 00:37:13,576
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's a little artsy-fartsy.

443
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:16,774
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The artsy's okay, but when she gets fartsy...

444
00:37:16,816 --> 00:37:19,485
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at... Oh, right on my shoes.

445
00:37:19,585 --> 00:37:21,174
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm so clumsy.

446
00:37:21,287 --> 00:37:24,477
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, hello there. What's your name?

447
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:25,870
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm Rodney Bigbottom...

448
00:37:25,991 --> 00:37:29,217
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I'm Rodney Copperbottom. Copperbottom.

449
00:37:29,628 --> 00:37:33,032
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a wonderful name, Bigbottom.

450
00:37:35,135 --> 00:37:36,688
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I just...

451
00:37:36,802 --> 00:37:39,719
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What happened to your friend? - He's been rear-ended.

452
00:37:41,607 --> 00:37:43,789
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, there you are.

453
00:37:44,744 --> 00:37:47,519
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aunt Fanny, he needs a place to stay.

454
00:37:47,613 --> 00:37:50,317
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, just make yourself at home.

455
00:37:50,383 --> 00:37:52,494
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you. That's very kind of you.

456
00:37:52,618 --> 00:37:54,076
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My pleasure.

457
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,944
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See a need, fill a need.

458
00:37:56,122 --> 00:37:57,746
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, just like Bigweld.

459
00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:01,151
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bigweld. That's a lot of robot.

460
00:38:03,896 --> 00:38:06,113
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. You can bunk with me.

461
00:38:06,198 --> 00:38:08,142
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll ignore the gossip.

462
00:38:14,441 --> 00:38:16,350
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You missed a spot.

463
00:38:16,509 --> 00:38:18,655
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fender, get out of my room!

464
00:38:18,778 --> 00:38:20,165
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not in your room.

465
00:38:20,279 --> 00:38:22,604
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am now. Now I'm not. I am. Not. Am...

466
00:38:22,682 --> 00:38:24,758
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get out of my room.

467
00:38:27,721 --> 00:38:31,434
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, man, this is my third oil change today. Something's wrong with me.

468
00:38:32,291 --> 00:38:33,785
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry.

469
00:38:34,694 --> 00:38:37,849
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here we are. Home sweet home.

470
00:38:37,897 --> 00:38:40,364
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's mine is yours.

471
00:38:40,433 --> 00:38:42,092
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh, dear. - I'll get them.

472
00:38:42,201 --> 00:38:44,182
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at that. Now they're arm-wrestling.

473
00:38:47,474 --> 00:38:51,115
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Could you separate them? Hurry, my backside itches.

474
00:39:15,267 --> 00:39:19,430
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know that sounds bad, but I'm just doing musical arm farts.

475
00:39:21,141 --> 00:39:22,564
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know how to do those?

476
00:39:22,742 --> 00:39:26,252
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're hard to do, because we're metal, but that's where the skill comes in.

477
00:39:26,278 --> 00:39:28,151
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm real close. Listen.

478
00:39:28,247 --> 00:39:29,906
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, wait.

479
00:39:30,016 --> 00:39:31,889
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, wait, wait.

480
00:39:32,652 --> 00:39:35,950
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't tell me that didn't sound like a... Like an old man.

481
00:39:36,922 --> 00:39:40,397
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, I'm a little tired. Maybe tomorrow.

482
00:39:40,426 --> 00:39:42,572
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kind of a rough day, huh?

483
00:39:42,728 --> 00:39:45,468
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kind of. My dad's probably sitting by the phone...

484
00:39:45,531 --> 00:39:47,677
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...waiting for his brilliant son to call...

485
00:39:47,767 --> 00:39:51,313
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and tell him what a big success my first day was.

486
00:39:51,671 --> 00:39:53,200
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know it's not your problem.

487
00:39:53,306 --> 00:39:55,773
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you burden your friends, you won't have any.

488
00:39:55,841 --> 00:39:57,572
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you, a fortune cookie?

489
00:39:57,677 --> 00:40:00,488
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"That's what friends..."

490
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,067
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You consider me a friend?

491
00:40:02,248 --> 00:40:04,229
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sure, what else would I consider you?

492
00:40:04,317 --> 00:40:07,128
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}An embarrassment, a way to rebel against your parents...

493
00:40:07,187 --> 00:40:09,618
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...a desperate cry for help. The list is endless.

494
00:40:09,855 --> 00:40:11,444
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's just stick with friend.

495
00:40:11,557 --> 00:40:14,617
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, even though you had a discouraging day, remember...

496
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:16,604
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...there's another one coming tomorrow.

497
00:40:16,696 --> 00:40:19,649
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, my last roommate jumped out that window.

498
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:22,275
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Fender.

499
00:40:24,337 --> 00:40:27,598
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, baby. Let it rip!

500
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:33,426
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guys, come on, what are you, 3 years old?

501
00:40:33,512 --> 00:40:35,588
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is how a man does it.

502
00:40:35,681 --> 00:40:37,827
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You guys are so gross.

503
00:40:37,917 --> 00:40:41,107
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Besides, this is how you do it.

504
00:40:41,554 --> 00:40:44,436
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, kids, get a load of this.

505
00:40:48,894 --> 00:40:50,910
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aunt Fanny...

506
00:40:50,997 --> 00:40:53,143
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...we were using our arms.

507
00:40:53,232 --> 00:40:55,972
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, excuse me.

508
00:40:56,035 --> 00:40:59,024
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lady, please...

509
00:40:59,372 --> 00:41:01,660
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...see a doctor.

510
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:14,648
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Breakfast.

511
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,314
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This will perk everyone up.

512
00:41:16,422 --> 00:41:18,853
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some of Aunt Fanny's fresh-brewed grease.

513
00:41:18,924 --> 00:41:20,382
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yummy!

514
00:41:20,526 --> 00:41:23,028
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Careful, it's hot.

515
00:41:29,568 --> 00:41:31,644
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, what are you guys doing today?

516
00:41:32,138 --> 00:41:34,391
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We're doing it. - What about you?

517
00:41:34,473 --> 00:41:36,525
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bigweld's disappeared, and you're sitting here.

518
00:41:36,609 --> 00:41:38,447
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's already been established.

519
00:41:38,577 --> 00:41:41,838
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I gotta find out what happened to him. - Hey, you want my advice?

520
00:41:41,881 --> 00:41:43,790
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Sure. - Forget it.

521
00:41:43,883 --> 00:41:47,560
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Never try, never fail." Those are the words I live by.

522
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:50,775
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Crank, the idol of millions is gone, and no one seems to care.

523
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:53,250
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There should be an angry mob out there.

524
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:54,983
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the...?

525
00:41:58,164 --> 00:42:00,240
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow, that was great, psychic friend.

526
00:42:00,366 --> 00:42:03,948
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now say, " Money should be falling from the sky."

527
00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:06,567
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Say it. Say it.

528
00:42:08,307 --> 00:42:10,667
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, folks, all sold out.

529
00:42:10,743 --> 00:42:13,174
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing but upgrades from here on in.

530
00:42:13,245 --> 00:42:16,091
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I like myself just the way I am.

531
00:42:16,148 --> 00:42:18,745
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We can't afford upgrades! - Let's get him!

532
00:42:18,818 --> 00:42:22,008
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing? Don't throw me.

533
00:42:22,788 --> 00:42:24,934
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Isn't that the guy that fixed Fender's neck?

534
00:42:25,024 --> 00:42:26,755
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, that guy fixes bots.

535
00:42:26,892 --> 00:42:28,765
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, that kid can help you.

536
00:42:28,928 --> 00:42:31,216
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Brace yourself. You're about to get popular.

537
00:42:32,398 --> 00:42:34,165
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Only those with insurance.

538
00:42:34,267 --> 00:42:37,386
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I forgot. Everybody, come on.

539
00:42:37,803 --> 00:42:40,199
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Parts, man. I need parts.

540
00:42:40,273 --> 00:42:43,119
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't look that... bad.

541
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:46,877
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hey, everybody, spare parts! - Yeah!

542
00:42:46,979 --> 00:42:50,312
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What's wrong with you robots?

543
00:42:50,416 --> 00:42:52,704
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should all be ashamed of yourselves.

544
00:42:52,785 --> 00:42:54,338
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why do you have two noses?

545
00:42:54,453 --> 00:42:57,679
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One's for showing, one's for blowing.

546
00:42:57,723 --> 00:43:01,269
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Sorry. - Hey, could you look at my arm?

547
00:43:01,494 --> 00:43:03,819
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Nice grip. - Like iron.

548
00:43:03,963 --> 00:43:07,189
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I can't get rid of this spare tire. - I am losing my mind.

549
00:43:07,733 --> 00:43:09,286
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Back off, back off.

550
00:43:09,435 --> 00:43:12,246
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's got his own dreams that won't come true.

551
00:43:14,507 --> 00:43:16,036


552
00:43:17,376 --> 00:43:20,329
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See a need, fill a need.

553
00:43:20,579 --> 00:43:22,238
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait.

554
00:43:23,149 --> 00:43:25,093
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who wants to get fixed?

555
00:44:07,493 --> 00:44:10,612
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks, Rodney. You're number one.

556
00:44:26,913 --> 00:44:30,459
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rodney! Rodney! Rodney!

557
00:44:39,392 --> 00:44:41,194
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah.

558
00:44:41,521 --> 00:44:44,676
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have never felt so relaxed.

559
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:49,242
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Say, do you mind giving me a little scratch between the shoulder blades?

560
00:44:49,529 --> 00:44:52,375
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There you... Easy, tiger.

561
00:44:52,432 --> 00:44:54,163
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey! Take it easy.

562
00:44:54,266 --> 00:44:56,733
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, what are you trying to do, kill me?

563
00:44:56,803 --> 00:44:59,614
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Relax. It's me, your mommy.

564
00:44:59,673 --> 00:45:02,590
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- How did you get in here? - I came up the air shaft.

565
00:45:02,641 --> 00:45:05,416
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know you don't like anybody here to see me.

566
00:45:05,478 --> 00:45:08,431
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Well, what do you want? - Someone's fixing them.

567
00:45:08,548 --> 00:45:11,703
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What? - Someone is repairing outmodes...

568
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:14,525
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and they are laughing at you. - Who?

569
00:45:14,588 --> 00:45:17,185
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And are you sure they're not laughing with me?

570
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:18,877
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

571
00:45:18,992 --> 00:45:23,025
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So what if one crazy fanatic repairs a few outmodes? Who cares?

572
00:45:23,063 --> 00:45:26,776
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Think. Use those brains I stole for you. Today, it's one.

573
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,919
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about tomorrow, when everybody gets the idea this is okay?

574
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:32,887
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"We can fix ourselves. We don't need upgrades.

575
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:34,396
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We want Bigweld."

576
00:45:34,507 --> 00:45:36,583
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then what happens to you?

577
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:38,726
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, okay. Take it easy.

578
00:45:38,812 --> 00:45:41,931
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've got to find out who this is and stop him.

579
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:45,869
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not stop him, crush him, destroy him.

580
00:45:45,886 --> 00:45:50,334
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And by the way, I brought you a little something for your desk.

581
00:45:50,357 --> 00:45:52,230


582
00:45:57,864 --> 00:46:00,959
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Is there anyone else waiting? - Let me look.

583
00:46:02,836 --> 00:46:05,089
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- A few. - "A few"?

584
00:46:05,171 --> 00:46:08,432
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did you expect, Rodney? Bigweld was gone.

585
00:46:08,475 --> 00:46:13,313
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sweepers were on the loose, but then came Copperbottom.

586
00:46:13,313 --> 00:46:15,910
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm getting all static-y just thinking about it.

587
00:46:16,016 --> 00:46:18,933
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not Bigweld. These robots need parts.

588
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:21,795
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mail call. Mail call.

589
00:46:21,855 --> 00:46:24,322
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Copperbottom, this one's from your mom.

590
00:46:24,391 --> 00:46:26,573
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, is there anything for me?

591
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:29,506
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I got something for you.

592
00:46:29,563 --> 00:46:31,401
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's from my sister.

593
00:46:31,498 --> 00:46:33,051
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I recognize the handwriting.

594
00:46:33,632 --> 00:46:35,328
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is anything wrong?

595
00:46:35,435 --> 00:46:39,040
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll say. His father's got one foot in the junkyard...

596
00:46:39,072 --> 00:46:42,891
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and if they can't find new parts for him, he's only got a few miles left.

597
00:46:43,243 --> 00:46:46,125
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rodney, are you really worried about your dad?

598
00:46:46,213 --> 00:46:47,837
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you wanna go home?

599
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:50,089
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, if I go home, I still can't help him.

600
00:46:50,183 --> 00:46:52,852
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're out of parts. We've gotta get to Bigweld.

601
00:46:52,918 --> 00:46:56,144
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's the only one that can fix this.

602
00:46:58,191 --> 00:47:01,595
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's trying to tell us something. What is it, boy? What's wrong?

603
00:47:01,962 --> 00:47:05,081
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bigweld is going...

604
00:47:05,165 --> 00:47:06,517
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...dancing.

605
00:47:06,665 --> 00:47:09,820
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course, the Bigweld Ball.

606
00:47:09,970 --> 00:47:12,923
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't have the Bigweld Ball without Bigweld.

607
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:15,813
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, that's it, then. I'm going to the Bigweld Ball.

608
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:18,127
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? That's the fanciest party of the year.

609
00:47:18,211 --> 00:47:19,942
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll never get past the gate.

610
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:27,236


611
00:47:30,789 --> 00:47:33,944
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Can I help you? - I think maybe you can.

612
00:47:33,994 --> 00:47:37,362
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is Count Roderick von Brokenzipper.

613
00:47:37,397 --> 00:47:39,508
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Formerly Count Velcro.

614
00:47:40,432 --> 00:47:42,021
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are the trumpets?

615
00:47:42,202 --> 00:47:45,084
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We were promised trumpets to announce the count's arrival.

616
00:47:45,138 --> 00:47:48,542
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, Your Grace. Beat me until you're happy.

617
00:47:48,575 --> 00:47:52,121
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's happy. And I'm not feeling too bad myself.

618
00:47:52,579 --> 00:47:56,161
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Let me... You're not on the list. - We're what?

619
00:47:56,216 --> 00:47:58,197
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Once again.

620
00:47:58,717 --> 00:48:02,085
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you. Fine, we will go.

621
00:48:02,122 --> 00:48:03,853
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll explain to your superiors...

622
00:48:03,957 --> 00:48:08,440
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...why we were not able to attend your little luau, barn dance, whatever it is.

623
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:10,606
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But we're leaving in a huff.

624
00:48:10,729 --> 00:48:13,575
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no. No. Please, go right in.

625
00:48:13,632 --> 00:48:16,787
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In fact, would the count like to hit me?

626
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:19,989
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The count hit you? The arrogance of some people.

627
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:23,135
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I will hit you on his behalf.

628
00:48:23,977 --> 00:48:25,530
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you, Your Grace.

629
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,069
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, let's split up.

630
00:48:30,183 --> 00:48:33,136
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you see Bigweld, come and find me.

631
00:48:33,485 --> 00:48:36,117
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If anything goes wrong, we'll signal each other.

632
00:48:36,189 --> 00:48:39,937
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What kind of signal do you want? You want something kind of subtle, like:

633
00:48:40,827 --> 00:48:42,250
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or:

634
00:48:43,395 --> 00:48:44,948
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, how about this:

635
00:48:49,903 --> 00:48:53,342
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ricola!

636
00:48:53,572 --> 00:48:56,074
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Subtle. Let's get to work.

637
00:48:56,476 --> 00:48:59,322
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A screwdriver, please. Shaken, not stirred.

638
00:48:59,379 --> 00:49:00,908
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, sir.

639
00:49:19,566 --> 00:49:21,819
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll have what he's having.

640
00:49:22,102 --> 00:49:26,406
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, Cappy, it's nice that you can see me like this, away from work.

641
00:49:26,406 --> 00:49:30,676
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See my more casual, fun-Ioving side.

642
00:49:33,812 --> 00:49:36,314
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, where were we?

643
00:49:36,416 --> 00:49:39,998
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, there are never any interesting men at these parties.

644
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:43,174
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello, ladies. Fender von Fender at your service.

645
00:49:43,323 --> 00:49:45,790
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi, I'm Loretta...

646
00:49:45,859 --> 00:49:47,174
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...Geargrinder.

647
00:49:47,327 --> 00:49:52,012
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anyone dressed as badly as you are must be an eccentric billionaire.

648
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:56,389
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ladies and gentlebots, now coming to the stage...

649
00:49:56,436 --> 00:49:58,618
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...the top bot, the big bolt...

650
00:49:58,705 --> 00:50:02,595
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...who's your daddy? Mr. Phineas T. Ratchet.

651
00:50:02,709 --> 00:50:06,007
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you. We now come to the point of the evening...

652
00:50:06,045 --> 00:50:09,591
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...where I have the tremendous honor of introducing...

653
00:50:09,616 --> 00:50:12,914
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Excuse me. Sorry. ...our beloved founder, Mr. Bigweld...

654
00:50:12,986 --> 00:50:15,655
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...who, unfortunately, is unable to attend.

655
00:50:16,755 --> 00:50:19,530
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What? - He sends his apologies...

656
00:50:19,592 --> 00:50:22,261
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...his love and a small box of assorted cookies.

657
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:25,513
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Not coming? - And what are you doing here?

658
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:27,366
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What have you done with Bigweld?

659
00:50:29,301 --> 00:50:31,661
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How come we don't see him anymore, huh?

660
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:35,031
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Security, we have a party-crasher.

661
00:50:35,074 --> 00:50:39,479
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, that's right, and I had to put all this junk on in order to get in here...

662
00:50:39,479 --> 00:50:43,998
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...so that I could tell Bigweld that you are outmoding millions of bots.

663
00:50:44,384 --> 00:50:47,373
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I know because I spend all day fixing them.

664
00:50:47,654 --> 00:50:49,006
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You.

665
00:51:09,275 --> 00:51:12,857
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my darling, that is the cry of the deep-doo-doo bird.

666
00:51:12,912 --> 00:51:14,856
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I must fly.

667
00:51:16,216 --> 00:51:17,710
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take him for a drive...

668
00:51:17,816 --> 00:51:21,979
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and bring me back his exact weight in paper clips.

669
00:51:23,223 --> 00:51:25,583
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No! - No?

670
00:51:26,426 --> 00:51:28,299
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll escort him out.

671
00:51:28,661 --> 00:51:31,472
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't wanna look bad in front of your people, do you?

672
00:51:31,531 --> 00:51:33,084
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Good point. - When I get back...

673
00:51:33,199 --> 00:51:35,381
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...I'll show you my casual, fun-Ioving side.

674
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:37,198
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, you.

675
00:51:37,337 --> 00:51:39,662
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Get moving. - What? What are you doing?

676
00:51:39,738 --> 00:51:41,754
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Saving your life.

677
00:51:42,542 --> 00:51:44,558
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Come on. - Let him go.

678
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:46,374
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let him go. Let him go.

679
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:48,766
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Get out of here, you idiot. - Get him!

680
00:51:48,882 --> 00:51:50,755
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Fender, let's go. - You know him?

681
00:51:50,850 --> 00:51:52,581
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fender, wait for me.

682
00:51:53,018 --> 00:51:54,785
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wonderbot.

683
00:51:56,723 --> 00:51:58,596
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get out of my way!

684
00:51:59,758 --> 00:52:01,940
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Tim, I'd like to see Mr. Bigweld.

685
00:52:02,061 --> 00:52:04,172
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, you again.

686
00:52:07,867 --> 00:52:09,598
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, that was amazing.

687
00:52:09,702 --> 00:52:13,248
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- So where do we go now? - I'm taking you to the train station.

688
00:52:13,339 --> 00:52:15,141
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What? No way.

689
00:52:15,241 --> 00:52:16,593
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You don't know what you're dealing with.

690
00:52:16,709 --> 00:52:19,140
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ratchet will use your head for a hood ornament.

691
00:52:19,212 --> 00:52:21,809
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not leaving until I find Bigweld.

692
00:52:21,881 --> 00:52:23,825
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That's not... - Can't you take me to him?

693
00:52:26,185 --> 00:52:28,473
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I must be out of my mind.

694
00:52:39,064 --> 00:52:41,460
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Au reservoir, my darling.

695
00:52:42,535 --> 00:52:46,081
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Thanks for walking me home. - Thanks for carrying me up that hill.

696
00:52:46,139 --> 00:52:49,329
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Until tomorrow? - I shall count the seconds.

697
00:52:49,608 --> 00:52:51,660
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So far, I'm up to four.

698
00:52:52,579 --> 00:52:54,867
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You crazy nut boy.

699
00:52:55,014 --> 00:52:57,302
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Crazy about you.

700
00:53:09,461 --> 00:53:13,315
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm singing in the oil

701
00:53:13,333 --> 00:53:16,772
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm singing in the oil

702
00:53:16,803 --> 00:53:19,756
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After all that work and toil

703
00:53:19,806 --> 00:53:23,839
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just slipping in the oil

704
00:53:23,843 --> 00:53:27,389
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know where I've been sent

705
00:53:27,413 --> 00:53:30,995
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm covered in lubricant

706
00:53:31,084 --> 00:53:33,195
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My life has turned around.

707
00:53:33,285 --> 00:53:37,413
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}From now on, I'm a winner!

708
00:53:37,656 --> 00:53:40,751
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop, you've made a mistake. I'm alive. You can't do this.

709
00:53:40,793 --> 00:53:42,346
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Help.

710
00:53:51,204 --> 00:53:53,256
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, we tried. Let's get out of here.

711
00:53:53,339 --> 00:53:54,928
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no. Something's up.

712
00:53:55,074 --> 00:53:57,126
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at all these newspapers and this mail.

713
00:53:57,210 --> 00:54:00,163
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. They probably stopped delivering these years ago.

714
00:54:00,213 --> 00:54:01,909
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Paper.

00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:08,062
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You say something? - Nice one of you.

717
00:54:08,154 --> 00:54:09,257


718
00:54:09,389 --> 00:54:12,058
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. We gotta get you out of here.

719
00:54:20,599 --> 00:54:22,995
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Big, creaky door.

720
00:54:23,102 --> 00:54:24,276
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perfect.

721
00:54:49,895 --> 00:54:51,733
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at this.

722
00:54:51,831 --> 00:54:53,977
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is Bigweld's actual workshop.

723
00:54:54,067 --> 00:54:56,143
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I recognize it from his old TV show.

724
00:54:56,235 --> 00:54:59,912
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Could you keep it down? We're not supposed to be here.

725
00:55:01,941 --> 00:55:03,470
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you know what these are?

726
00:55:03,576 --> 00:55:06,387
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These are Bigweld's original invention designs.

727
00:55:06,446 --> 00:55:09,672
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That's his own writing. - This is strange.

728
00:55:09,716 --> 00:55:12,147
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How come it just stops in the middle?

729
00:55:12,218 --> 00:55:14,329
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at this.

730
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:18,203
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember, he used to have these on his show?

731
00:55:18,224 --> 00:55:20,691
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rodney, I don't know how to tell you this, but...

732
00:55:20,759 --> 00:55:22,976
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are they so dusty?

733
00:55:23,062 --> 00:55:25,043
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait, don't.

734
00:55:50,990 --> 00:55:54,085
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is much more elaborate than the ones on his show.

735
00:56:29,628 --> 00:56:31,359
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rodney, what do we do?

736
00:56:31,464 --> 00:56:35,283
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. This is kind of a first for me.

737
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:43,644
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah! - It's him.

738
00:56:53,018 --> 00:56:56,078
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Who's the king of the beach? - Are you all right?

739
00:56:56,155 --> 00:57:00,389
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, considering I'm an old fat guy who just crashed to the floor...

740
00:57:00,392 --> 00:57:03,274
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...I'm fantastic. Now, who the heck are you?

741
00:57:03,329 --> 00:57:04,681
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm Rodney.

742
00:57:04,797 --> 00:57:07,892
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I thought you were the dominoes delivery boy.

743
00:57:07,967 --> 00:57:10,884
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, let's set them up again, only bigger.

744
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:13,994
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sir, is this what you've been working on?

745
00:57:14,073 --> 00:57:17,097
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is why no one sees you?

746
00:57:17,543 --> 00:57:20,496
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Young man, nobody likes a chatterbox.

747
00:57:20,579 --> 00:57:22,655
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But there's a terrible crisis, Mr. Bigweld.

748
00:57:22,882 --> 00:57:25,170
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We need to talk.

749
00:57:26,152 --> 00:57:30,556
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Son, I've gotta tell you, you're making a lousy first impression.

750
00:57:30,556 --> 00:57:35,060
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please, sir, he is your biggest fan. In fact, he's an inventor just like you.

751
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:37,171
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Well... - Show him that thing you made.

752
00:57:37,430 --> 00:57:39,683
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A device? A doohickey? A thingamajig?

753
00:57:41,567 --> 00:57:45,695
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, don't be scared. Show Mr. Bigweld what you can do.

754
00:57:45,704 --> 00:57:48,100
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go on. It's okay.

755
00:57:51,343 --> 00:57:54,889
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that what it's supposed to do?

756
00:57:56,449 --> 00:57:58,108
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It gets nervous under pressure...

757
00:57:58,250 --> 00:58:00,882
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Son, let me give you a good piece of advice.

758
00:58:00,953 --> 00:58:02,934
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yes? - Give up.

759
00:58:03,022 --> 00:58:05,797
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? You're telling me to quit?

760
00:58:05,891 --> 00:58:09,189
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I said "give up," but "quit" works just as good.

761
00:58:11,045 --> 00:58:13,298
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that what you did? Is that why you're sitting here...

762
00:58:13,382 --> 00:58:16,786
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...letting Ratchet turn robots like my father into outmodes?

763
00:58:16,819 --> 00:58:19,843
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kid, sometimes you just gotta know when you're licked.

764
00:58:19,889 --> 00:58:23,602
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you're Bigweld. You can fix anything.

765
00:58:23,626 --> 00:58:25,179
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I used to think so.

766
00:58:25,326 --> 00:58:28,765
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To me, having the company was all about making life better.

767
00:58:28,831 --> 00:58:32,021
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With Ratchet, it was making money that came first.

768
00:58:32,066 --> 00:58:36,372
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I became old-fashioned, an outmode.

769
00:58:36,572 --> 00:58:40,320
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go home, kid. If he beat me, he's gonna beat you.

770
00:58:40,341 --> 00:58:43,816
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The world you're looking for no longer exists. You missed it.

771
00:58:43,846 --> 00:58:45,755
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Find some other foolish dream.

772
00:58:45,881 --> 00:58:48,656
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm very, very...

773
00:58:48,716 --> 00:58:51,776
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...very busy.

774
00:58:52,688 --> 00:58:54,561
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I can see that.

775
00:58:56,592 --> 00:59:00,138
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All I ever wanted was to grow up to be like him.

776
00:59:11,207 --> 00:59:13,259
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Help. Open the door.

777
00:59:13,342 --> 00:59:15,488
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Open the door.

778
00:59:17,046 --> 00:59:19,027
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Close the door. Close the door!

779
00:59:29,058 --> 00:59:32,011
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow, look at all these parts. It's a smorgasbord.

780
00:59:32,061 --> 00:59:35,156
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at that. So many things I've wanted all my life.

781
00:59:35,231 --> 00:59:36,760
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, that's pretty.

782
00:59:53,948 --> 00:59:56,344
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, Mother, this way.

783
00:59:56,452 --> 00:59:58,504
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me look, please. I can't bear it.

784
00:59:58,854 --> 01:00:01,142
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No peeking, now. It's a surprise.

785
01:00:01,257 --> 01:00:02,644
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, you are a wicked boy.

786
01:00:02,758 --> 01:00:07,650
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And look.\n- For me? - It's got a full tank of gas.

787
01:00:06,362 --> 01:00:07,677


788
01:00:07,863 --> 01:00:09,915
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you're ready to mow, she's ready to go.

789
01:00:09,999 --> 01:00:13,225
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Has any mother ever had a better son?

790
01:00:13,269 --> 01:00:16,080
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}By the way, I found out who's been fixing those outmodes.

791
01:00:16,138 --> 01:00:17,667
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So tomorrow, these babies...

792
01:00:17,773 --> 01:00:20,442
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...are gonna chop him up along with all his buddies...

793
01:00:20,509 --> 01:00:24,055
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and every other walking pile of junk I'm sick of looking at.

794
01:00:25,481 --> 01:00:26,975
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's that?

795
01:00:57,413 --> 01:00:59,630
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is so wrong. This is so wrong.

796
01:01:00,149 --> 01:01:01,916
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Help. Help!

797
01:01:03,152 --> 01:01:04,219


798
01:01:10,658 --> 01:01:13,160
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rivet Town, please. One-way.

799
01:01:17,665 --> 01:01:19,017
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi, Mom.

800
01:01:19,134 --> 01:01:22,467
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I'm doing fine. How are you?

801
01:01:22,504 --> 01:01:26,466
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- And Dad? - He's right here. I'll put him on.

802
01:01:26,475 --> 01:01:29,107
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, buddy, how's it going?

803
01:01:29,211 --> 01:01:31,120
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Dad. How are you feeling?

804
01:01:31,213 --> 01:01:34,617
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, fine, fine. I...

805
01:01:35,451 --> 01:01:37,597
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've just been a little under the weather.

806
01:01:37,685 --> 01:01:39,796
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, we're just having a little trouble...

807
01:01:39,888 --> 01:01:43,114
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...finding your old man a replacement part, that's all.

808
01:01:43,192 --> 01:01:46,038
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But let's talk about you. What kind of work are you doing?

809
01:01:46,095 --> 01:01:47,968
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's Bigweld like? Did you meet him?

810
01:01:48,263 --> 01:01:51,003
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I met him, but...

811
01:01:51,966 --> 01:01:53,460
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's wrong, son?

812
01:01:53,601 --> 01:01:57,242
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not how we thought it was, Dad.

813
01:01:57,272 --> 01:02:00,225
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not... I can't...

814
01:02:01,043 --> 01:02:02,466
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I see.

815
01:02:02,610 --> 01:02:05,006
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm really sorry I let you down. - No, no, no.

816
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:07,997
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You could never let me down, Rodney.

817
01:02:10,419 --> 01:02:13,408
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, I know it isn't easy, Rodney...

818
01:02:13,489 --> 01:02:16,121
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but a dream that you don't fight for...

819
01:02:16,191 --> 01:02:19,904
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...can haunt you for the rest of your life.

820
01:02:21,262 --> 01:02:22,685
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, Dad.

821
01:02:22,798 --> 01:02:25,158
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's up to you, son.

822
01:02:28,604 --> 01:02:32,043
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Your father loves you very much. - I know.

823
01:02:32,074 --> 01:02:36,202
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With our Friends and Family plan, you can talk to him 500 minutes a month.

824
01:02:36,211 --> 01:02:37,835
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Free nights and weekends.

825
01:02:37,946 --> 01:02:40,483
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yoo-hoo, Rodney!

826
01:02:40,549 --> 01:02:42,280
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait.

827
01:02:43,052 --> 01:02:46,112
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Your suitcase. - Thanks, Aunt Fanny, but I'm...

828
01:02:46,155 --> 01:02:48,895
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The others wanted to come and see you off too.

829
01:02:48,957 --> 01:02:50,486
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, why didn't they?

830
01:02:50,592 --> 01:02:53,652
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, they did.

831
01:02:55,663 --> 01:02:57,157
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Next time, let's split a cab.

832
01:02:59,835 --> 01:03:01,981
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who the heck is she?

833
01:03:02,104 --> 01:03:05,259
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I used to have a figure like that.

834
01:03:05,306 --> 01:03:07,702
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hurry, come on. One ticket to anywhere.

835
01:03:07,942 --> 01:03:09,531
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fender?

836
01:03:09,645 --> 01:03:11,518
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have a sister.

837
01:03:12,047 --> 01:03:13,991
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}An ugly sister.

838
01:03:14,116 --> 01:03:16,891
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, guess what. It's the sweepers.

839
01:03:16,951 --> 01:03:20,664
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're rounding up outmodes and taking them... What "them"? Us.

840
01:03:20,688 --> 01:03:22,597
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- To Madame Gasket's chop shop.

841
01:03:22,690 --> 01:03:25,572
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- And guess who's really behind it all. - Ratchet.

842
01:03:25,661 --> 01:03:28,258
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't wanna guess? I ran all this way in heels.

843
01:03:28,329 --> 01:03:29,918
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Come on, take a stab. - Ratchet.

844
01:03:30,099 --> 01:03:33,159
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ratchet! Listen to me. Listen to me.

845
01:03:33,202 --> 01:03:37,021
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We won't last a week. - Okay, okay. Settle down. I got a plan.

846
01:03:37,072 --> 01:03:39,539
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Let's all get on that train. - Come on.

847
01:03:39,641 --> 01:03:42,273
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, wait a minute. You're all giving up?

848
01:03:42,343 --> 01:03:44,419
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You started it. - Well, I'm ending it.

849
01:03:44,513 --> 01:03:47,502
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My mistake was hoping that Bigweld would fight our battles.

850
01:03:47,583 --> 01:03:49,729
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, he won't. It's up to us.

851
01:03:49,852 --> 01:03:52,627
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If we don't do something about Ratchet, no one will.

852
01:03:52,721 --> 01:03:54,523
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, let's fight back.

853
01:03:54,656 --> 01:03:56,708
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fighting never solved anything.

854
01:03:56,825 --> 01:03:59,565
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Quitting isn't so productive either. I gotta tell you.

855
01:03:59,661 --> 01:04:01,677
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the big boy.

856
01:04:01,797 --> 01:04:03,908
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, be still, my pump.

857
01:04:04,032 --> 01:04:06,949
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kid, if you're gonna fight, I'm going in with you.

858
01:04:07,001 --> 01:04:08,424
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You... You are?

859
01:04:08,537 --> 01:04:11,798
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, who's the dame with the sweet keister?

860
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:13,393
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- But why? - I don't know.

861
01:04:13,509 --> 01:04:15,655
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm a big guy, and I like women with large...

862
01:04:15,744 --> 01:04:18,484
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no. Why are you gonna help us?

863
01:04:18,547 --> 01:04:22,022
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because I wanna grow up to be like you.

864
01:04:26,021 --> 01:04:27,610
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then let's do it.

865
01:04:27,756 --> 01:04:33,141
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, gang. Let's give that Ratchet an old-school fix-it!

866
01:04:34,363 --> 01:04:37,661
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, what a man.

867
01:04:38,567 --> 01:04:39,811
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Someone get a crane.

868
01:04:47,342 --> 01:04:49,109
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mother, I'm an adult, okay?

869
01:04:49,211 --> 01:04:52,401
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So stop telling me how to kill Bigweld. I'm doing it today...

870
01:04:52,447 --> 01:04:56,824
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...how I want, where I want and with whatever I want.

871
01:05:00,689 --> 01:05:03,713
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, boardroom, 10 minutes. I want you both there.

872
01:05:03,759 --> 01:05:06,332
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Bigweld, should we come too?

873
01:05:06,428 --> 01:05:08,645
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no. You stay here...

874
01:05:08,730 --> 01:05:11,885
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and watch Daddy's limo. - Yes, sir.

875
01:05:11,966 --> 01:05:13,875
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going inside to kick some booty.

876
01:05:13,968 --> 01:05:16,293
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, you know, your boyfriend here is a genius.

877
01:05:16,405 --> 01:05:18,101
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What? - Oh, he's not my... He is?

878
01:05:18,207 --> 01:05:19,974
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am?

879
01:05:20,909 --> 01:05:23,482
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks for still believing in me.

880
01:05:24,546 --> 01:05:27,879
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's good to be home. Toodley-oodley!

881
01:05:36,592 --> 01:05:40,102
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I use the Brazilian wax. It makes me feel like every day's a fiesta.

882
01:05:40,128 --> 01:05:42,204
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell Mr. Ratchet his 10:00 is here.

883
01:05:42,297 --> 01:05:43,791
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm all over it. Yes, sir.

884
01:05:50,906 --> 01:05:52,364
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Bigweld, sir.

885
01:05:53,008 --> 01:05:55,060
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Bigweld, sir.

886
01:05:59,214 --> 01:06:01,087
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Mr. Bigweld.

887
01:06:01,950 --> 01:06:03,931
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no. Tell him I'm not here.

888
01:06:04,019 --> 01:06:06,936
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Tell him anything, just don't let him in. - Ratchet!

889
01:06:09,358 --> 01:06:11,374
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'll cut to the point. - What happened?

890
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:13,404
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Run out of dominoes? I'll send you more.

891
01:06:13,528 --> 01:06:16,125
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You're fired! - Fired? On what grounds?

892
01:06:16,231 --> 01:06:18,413
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This company's never been more profitable.

893
01:06:18,533 --> 01:06:20,406
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Profit, schmofit. Now, get out.

894
01:06:20,535 --> 01:06:23,630
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, wait, please listen to me. You can't do this to me.

895
01:06:23,672 --> 01:06:26,732
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This job is my life. It means everything to me.

896
01:06:26,775 --> 01:06:28,921
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't know what I've done to get here.

897
01:06:29,044 --> 01:06:33,979
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The lies I've told. The lives I've ruined. This isn't helping me.

898
01:06:34,315 --> 01:06:36,640
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Get me security. - Wait, please.

899
01:06:36,785 --> 01:06:39,560
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can't I just make one more heartfelt plea?

900
01:06:39,621 --> 01:06:41,530
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, what did you wanna say?

901
01:06:41,623 --> 01:06:43,247
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That.

902
01:06:43,659 --> 01:06:47,205
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my gosh. I'm as crazy as my mother.

903
01:06:55,904 --> 01:07:00,067
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take that fish to the chop shop and put my name on his parking space.

904
01:07:00,142 --> 01:07:01,636
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let go of him.

905
01:07:02,678 --> 01:07:05,833
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sure. Listen, kid, it's over. You lost.

906
01:07:05,914 --> 01:07:09,318
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bigweld is gonna be melted down into next season's upgrades...

907
01:07:09,351 --> 01:07:13,549
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...along with you, your moronic coffeepot and Cappy.

908
01:07:14,656 --> 01:07:16,565
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Such a waste.

909
01:07:51,693 --> 01:07:53,674
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Bigweld, are you okay?

910
01:07:53,762 --> 01:07:56,679
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm the prettiest girl at the Harvest Moon Ball.

911
01:07:56,765 --> 01:07:59,161
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll take that as a "no."

912
01:08:12,414 --> 01:08:14,110
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Out of the way!

913
01:08:16,451 --> 01:08:17,909
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rodney.

914
01:08:29,931 --> 01:08:32,742
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Road trip! Road trip! Road trip!

915
01:08:32,801 --> 01:08:34,497
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You guys are so embarrassing.

916
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:38,416
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, that's Rodney. He's in some kind of trouble.

917
01:08:38,673 --> 01:08:40,369
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've gotta repair him.

918
01:08:40,475 --> 01:08:43,012
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, I got your back.

919
01:08:48,616 --> 01:08:51,771
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, we've gotta help Rodney.

920
01:08:53,522 --> 01:08:56,297
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No, Piper, you stay here. - No way.

921
01:08:56,391 --> 01:08:59,581
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's be honest. We're headed for a huge butt-whupping.

922
01:08:59,628 --> 01:09:01,988
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whatever happens to us, make something of yourself.

923
01:09:02,464 --> 01:09:05,762
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're the only thing I've got to leave behind. Goodbye!

924
01:09:05,801 --> 01:09:07,330
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's right, Piper.

925
01:09:07,436 --> 01:09:09,796
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're headed for a huge butt-whupping.

926
01:09:10,372 --> 01:09:13,432


927
01:09:13,675 --> 01:09:16,936


928
01:09:36,198 --> 01:09:40,231


929
01:09:42,237 --> 01:09:44,075
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, got it!

930
01:09:44,172 --> 01:09:46,224
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rodney, what's going on? Where are we?

931
01:09:46,308 --> 01:09:48,110
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's okay. You're all right.

932
01:10:08,697 --> 01:10:11,164
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, boys, we got them right where they want us.

933
01:10:11,234 --> 01:10:12,763
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Boost me up.

934
01:10:14,002 --> 01:10:15,661
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Watch your hands down there.

935
01:10:17,606 --> 01:10:19,966
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rodney! We're here to save you!

936
01:10:28,083 --> 01:10:29,850
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do you think it's going so far?

937
01:10:38,693 --> 01:10:39,796
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The plug.

938
01:10:39,995 --> 01:10:43,150
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold on, guys! I gotta get to the other side.

939
01:11:13,628 --> 01:11:15,988
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're out of here!

940
01:11:35,817 --> 01:11:37,548
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The chop shop.

941
01:11:37,686 --> 01:11:41,434
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That's it. Game over. - The game is not over.

942
01:11:41,923 --> 01:11:43,725
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is our moment to shine.

943
01:11:43,825 --> 01:11:46,944
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is where you show what you're really made of.

944
01:11:48,797 --> 01:11:51,987
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In my case, it's a rare metal. It's called "afraidium."

945
01:11:52,067 --> 01:11:54,569
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's yellow. It tastes like chicken.

946
01:11:56,271 --> 01:11:58,073
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't know I could do that.

947
01:11:58,206 --> 01:11:59,664
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rodney's right.

948
01:11:59,774 --> 01:12:05,312
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am tired of just complaining and never doing anything.

949
01:12:05,313 --> 01:12:06,937
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}L... l...

950
01:12:07,515 --> 01:12:09,388
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wanna try.

951
01:12:09,517 --> 01:12:11,011
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Forget it. I'm sorry. No.

952
01:12:11,119 --> 01:12:14,523
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes! I want to try.

953
01:12:14,623 --> 01:12:16,567
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then you're first.

954
01:12:18,693 --> 01:12:20,222
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}First for what?

955
01:12:20,362 --> 01:12:24,668
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They want us to upgrade? Then let's upgrade.

956
01:12:30,405 --> 01:12:33,809
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gasket, you're a sick, twisted, evil robot.

957
01:12:33,975 --> 01:12:35,184
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I try.

958
01:13:07,275 --> 01:13:09,184
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, good.

959
01:13:09,277 --> 01:13:11,079
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Company.

960
01:13:11,179 --> 01:13:16,149
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you're the little glob of tin who's been making all the trouble.

961
01:13:16,184 --> 01:13:17,951
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who are these losers?

962
01:13:18,086 --> 01:13:20,268
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We, sir... - I'm a woman.

963
01:13:20,388 --> 01:13:21,917
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ouch.

964
01:13:22,023 --> 01:13:24,834
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've come to rescue our friend, you evil bag of bolts.

965
01:13:24,893 --> 01:13:28,154
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you will be defeated by the very outmodes...

966
01:13:28,196 --> 01:13:31,564
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...that you scorned and defaced.

967
01:13:31,666 --> 01:13:35,379
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, because there's seven of us and only one of you.

968
01:13:40,075 --> 01:13:42,744
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's seven of us and... Eight, nine...

969
01:13:42,811 --> 01:13:44,863
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Did you count that one? - I think so.

970
01:13:44,979 --> 01:13:47,932
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Could you all stop moving around?! It's so frustrating!

971
01:13:47,982 --> 01:13:49,855
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think I counted one of you twice!

972
01:13:49,984 --> 01:13:53,352
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}While you're at it, count these.

973
01:13:58,293 --> 01:14:02,456
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As soon as we're done with you, these hit the streets.

974
01:14:03,198 --> 01:14:07,575
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the last day any outmode will ever see.

975
01:14:16,611 --> 01:14:18,413
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did I miss the butt-whupping?

976
01:14:20,115 --> 01:14:22,617
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No. - Matter of fact, you're a little bit early.

977
01:14:27,155 --> 01:14:32,025
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rodney! Rodney! Rodney!

978
01:14:32,026 --> 01:14:35,252
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Well, let's get started. - Testify, sister!

979
01:14:36,364 --> 01:14:38,937
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Charge! - Charge!

980
01:15:02,056 --> 01:15:04,653
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no! He's got a steel chair.

981
01:15:06,561 --> 01:15:10,451
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But he's back up into a neck-breaker.

982
01:15:10,498 --> 01:15:12,550
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's up to the top rope.

983
01:15:12,667 --> 01:15:16,450
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Look at the hang time! - That's sure gonna leave a dent.

984
01:15:53,508 --> 01:15:55,939
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Say hello to my dimpled friend.

985
01:16:02,383 --> 01:16:07,839


986
01:16:09,624 --> 01:16:12,814


987
01:17:19,994 --> 01:17:22,105
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is gonna get greasy!

988
01:17:26,401 --> 01:17:30,564
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Are you thinking what I'm thinking? - I sure am.

989
01:17:44,419 --> 01:17:47,479
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See a need, fill a need!

990
01:17:47,556 --> 01:17:49,738
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This isn't what I was thinking at all.

991
01:18:02,571 --> 01:18:05,346
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing? Get off me.

992
01:18:06,674 --> 01:18:10,113
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me go! Do as I say. Get off!

993
01:18:16,184 --> 01:18:17,499
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ma!

994
01:18:20,021 --> 01:18:21,408
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My upgrades!

995
01:18:45,113 --> 01:18:48,826
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's all right, son. You can shine no matter what you...

996
01:18:48,850 --> 01:18:51,803
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! Just stop!

997
01:18:51,887 --> 01:18:53,239
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Rodney.

998
01:18:53,354 --> 01:18:56,343
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's open the gates of Bigweld Industries forever.

999
01:18:56,391 --> 01:19:00,245
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait a minute. There's one thing I need to do first.

1000
01:19:00,395 --> 01:19:03,312


1001
01:19:03,798 --> 01:19:05,292
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Herb!

1002
01:19:05,433 --> 01:19:07,377
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Herb! - Honey, what are you doing here?

1003
01:19:07,502 --> 01:19:10,039
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's Rodney, honey. - Rodney? Is he all right?

1004
01:19:10,104 --> 01:19:11,693
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come outside. Hurry.

1005
01:19:11,807 --> 01:19:14,132
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Copperbottom, where are you going?

1006
01:19:14,208 --> 01:19:15,939
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about the dishes?

1007
01:19:19,213 --> 01:19:20,600
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, get back here!

1008
01:19:20,715 --> 01:19:23,561
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll never wash in this town again.

1009
01:19:26,621 --> 01:19:29,503
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is all this? The whole town is out here.

1010
01:19:30,725 --> 01:19:33,227
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Rodney? - Dad!

1011
01:19:33,327 --> 01:19:35,165
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's someone I want you to meet.

1012
01:19:35,430 --> 01:19:37,647
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Is that...? - That's Bigweld, Dad...

1013
01:19:37,732 --> 01:19:40,020
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...the greatest robot in the world.

1014
01:19:40,134 --> 01:19:41,830
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Besides you.

1015
01:19:41,969 --> 01:19:46,441
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I understand you need a few parts. - Well, I'm not one to complain.

1016
01:19:46,441 --> 01:19:49,916
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, then don't. I've brought enough parts to make two of you.

1017
01:19:49,945 --> 01:19:51,012


1018
01:19:51,612 --> 01:19:55,289
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ladies and gentlebots...

1019
01:19:55,316 --> 01:19:58,198
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...I came all this way...

01:19:58,252 --> 01:20:00,683
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Would you cut that out? It's very distracting.

1021
01:20:00,755 --> 01:20:02,308
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where was I?

1023
01:20:03,959 --> 01:20:07,742
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. And Mrs. Copperbottom, I came all this way...

1024
01:20:07,762 --> 01:20:11,475
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...to tell you in person that your son, Rodney...

1025
01:20:11,566 --> 01:20:15,279
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...the man who got me off my big titanium tochis...

1026
01:20:15,336 --> 01:20:20,578
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...is now my right-hand bot and my eventual successor.

1027
01:20:23,512 --> 01:20:24,827
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Way to go, Rodney!

1028
01:20:27,181 --> 01:20:29,718
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Mom.

1029
01:20:30,852 --> 01:20:32,441
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Son.

1030
01:20:34,156 --> 01:20:37,145
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad, I know you kind of felt bad when I was growing up...

1031
01:20:37,191 --> 01:20:40,251
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...that you couldn't give me a lot of stuff.

1032
01:20:40,328 --> 01:20:42,474
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you gave me the most important thing:

1033
01:20:42,630 --> 01:20:44,574
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You believed in me.

1034

1035
01:20:47,869 --> 01:20:51,095
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, Dad, now I want your dream to come true.

1036
01:20:52,406 --> 01:20:54,979
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad, you always wanted to be a musician.

1037
01:20:55,109 --> 01:20:58,133
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now be one, for everyone to hear.

{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now I'm sure I've got a heart, because it's aching.

1041
01:21:17,265 --> 01:21:19,482
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll have to forgive me.

1042
01:21:19,634 --> 01:21:22,101
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm a little rusty.

1043

1045
01:21:41,422 --> 01:21:42,975
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's called "junk."

1046
