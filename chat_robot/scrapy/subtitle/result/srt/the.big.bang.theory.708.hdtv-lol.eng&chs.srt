1
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:04,060
- 嘿 我能问你个问题吗?  - 当然
- Hey, can I ask you a question?  - Sure.

2
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:05,030
从我认识你开始 这靶子就在了
You've had this dart board since I've known you,

3
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:06,400
但我从来没见你玩过飞镖
but I've never seen you play.

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,360
哦 我们玩过... 一次
Oh, uh, we played... once.

5
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,830
我把窗户砸破了
I broke a window.

6
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,030
什么窗户?
What window?

7
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,800
就是那边那扇
That one over there.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,330
Leonard 投球奖券在哪儿?
Leonard, where are the Skee-Ball tickets?

9
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:18,660
什么投球奖券?
Skee-Ball tickets?

10
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,860
就是我们三年前去游戏机房玩的时候赢来的
Yeah, from when we went to the arcade three years ago?

11
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:23,000
我终于决定要换什么奖品了
I finally decided what prize I want.

12
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,260
快点
Hurry up.

13
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,900
如果我还留着
Uh, if I still have them,

14
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,960
估计就在废料箱里
they're probably in the junk box.

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,260
你想换什么?
Ooh, what are you gonna get?

16
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,460
不关你的事
None of your business.

17
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,900
但如果你一会儿看到我
But when you see me wearing a flower

18
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,160
在翻领上带了朵花儿
in my lapel later,

19
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,300
很欢迎你来嗅嗅香味
you are most welcome to sniff it.

20
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,560
好了... 给你
Yup, oh... here you go.

21
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,960
谢谢
Oh, thank you.

22
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,900
给你 去换个橡皮擦玩吧
Here, get yourself an eraser for your troubles.

23
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,930
哦
Oh.

24
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,330
这个
Oh-ho.

25
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,600
我都忘了这个了
I forgot about this.

26
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,800
我考上大学的时候 我婶婶给我做的
My aunt made it for me when I started college.

27
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,430
她是不是讨厌你?
Aw, did she hate you?

28
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,330
为什么这么说? 就因为给了我一件扎人的丑毛衣
Why? Because I got an ugly, itchy sweater,

29
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,200
而给了我弟弟一辆车吗? 当然不 我是她最爱的孩子
and my brother got a car? No, I was her favorite.

30
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,600
好吧 好像还缺几张奖券
Yeah, I seem to be a few tickets short.

31
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,100
盒子里还有吗?
Are there more in the box?

32
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,730
我好像都拿出来了
Hmm, I think I got them all.

33
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:14,160
没了 里面没了
Nope, they're not in there.

34
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,260
你都没好好找 我来看看
Well, you barely looked. Let me see.

35
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,830
才不是 我... 我找了...
No, no, no, I... I looked, and...

36
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:20,060
没有奖券了
no more tickets.

37
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,200
Leonard 让我看看盒子里有什么
Leonard, let me look in the box.

38
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,430
好吧 好吧!
Okay, okay!

39
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,730
我会给你看盒子里的东西
I'm gonna show you what's in the box.

40
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:27,530
但你得保证... 别发疯
But just... promise not to flip out.

41
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,230
我干嘛要发疯?
Why would I flip out?

42
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,600
里面有蜘蛛吗?
Is it a spider?

43
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,830
真的有蜘蛛!
It's a spider!

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,630
不 如果真的有蜘蛛
No, if it was a spider,

45
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:38,100
Lenny肯定先疯了
Lenny would've flipped out.

46
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,160
好吧 Sheldon
Okay, Sheldon,

47
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,600
我知道我很早之前
I know I was supposed to return

48
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,200
就该去把这张碟还掉
this DVD a long time ago,

49
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,300
我也知道是用你的卡
and I know we rented it

50
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,400
租的
on your card.

51
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,430
但都已经过去快七年了
But it's been, like, seven years

52
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,500
也没发生什么坏事
and clearly nothing bad has happened.

53
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,860
所以... 与其和平时一样
So in... in... in... instead of being

54
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,500
你又叫又闹 使劲折腾
a giant pain in the ass like you always are,

55
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,660
能不能
what if

56
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,830
这次就试着冷静点呢?
this one time you just tried staying calm?

57
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,400
这要求好像挺合理的
That seems like a reasonable request.

58
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,260
但我还是得说 "嘿 Leonard 你能不能
Although so did, "Hey, Leonard, would you mind

59
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,260
把碟去还了?"
returning that DVD?"

60
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,130
对不起 我... 我会去还掉的
I'm sorry. I'll... I'll take care of it.

61
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,630
好吧
Okay.

62
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,530
我是说真的 真的会去还
I mean it, I'm going to.

63
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,360
我相信你
I believe you.

64
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,630
而你会继续保持冷静?
And you're going to stay calm?

65
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,860
我说过会的
I said I would.

66
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,130
怎么样?
How about that?

67
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:37,400
Sheldon讲道理了
Sheldon's being reasonable.

68
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,430
没错 我被吓到了
Yeah, it's freaking me out.

69
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,560
我还是走吧
I'm gonna go.

所以... 你说
So... when you say

81
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,360
你不会为了影碟的事乱发疯
you're not going to freak out about the DVD,

82
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,000
应该包括以下几点
here's what that means.

83
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,330
别盯着这件事
Don't fixate on it.

84
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:22,360
别大半夜把我叫醒
Don't wake me up in the middle of the night.

85
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,230
别在我上厕所的时候
Or nag me through the door

86
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,700
隔着门教训我
while I'm on the toilet.

87
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,360
首先我得说清楚 你上厕所的时候和你说话
Okay, first, talking to you while you're on the toilet

88
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,230
我也不好受 好吗?
isn't exactly a picnic for me either, okay?

89
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,530
记得...
Remember...

90
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:36,100
你能听到我讲话 我也能听到你放屁
when you can hear me, I can hear you.

91
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,430
其次...
And second...

92
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,900
你完全忽略了
you completely disregard

93
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,260
未尽事宜让我很不舒服这一点
how uncomfortable unresolved issues are for me.

94
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,330
这... 这就像是...
It's... it's like, a...

95
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,760
大脑有点痒 我却挠不到
an itch in my brain I can't scratch.

96
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,600
我手臂骨折的时候
When I broke my arm I used

97
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,260
就那衣架插这儿挠痒
to stick a coat hanger down there.

98
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,430
你试过吗? 插耳朵里挠挠?
You ever try that? Maybe go in through the ear?

99
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:59,000
如果你明白我的感受 就不会开这种玩笑
You wouldn't make jokes if you could feel the way I feel.

100
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,160
我也没法明白你的感受
Well, I don't know how to do that.

101
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,500
这样如何?
How about this?

102
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,260
我保证不会为影碟的事纠缠你
I promise I won't pester you about the DVD.

103
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,430
上厕所也不会骚扰你
You can defecate in peace.

104
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,000
这是双赢
That's a win for both of us.

105
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,460
但是...
But...

106
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,930
在这件事解决之前
until this matter is resolved,

107
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,500
我要你
I would like you

108
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,530
穿着这毛衣
to wear this sweater.

109
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,400
里面还不准穿其它衣服
With nothing underneath it.

110
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,660
这太蠢了
That's stupid.

111
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,930
为什么?
Why?

112
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,060
你说了这毛衣穿着扎人 不舒服
You say it's itchy and uncomfortable.

113
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,830
在我看来 这件事给我的感受完全相同
I say situations like this make me feel the same way.

114
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,600
我跟你说了 试试看用衣架挠
I'm telling you, try the hanger.

115
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,730
穿上
Put it on.

116
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,960
我们来分享一下这感受
Let's share the experience.

117
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,300
好吧
You got it.

118
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,730
如果穿上这件毛衣就能让你闭嘴的话
If this sweater shuts you up,

119
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,100
大家都会来买的
I'm gonna make a fortune

120
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,000
那我就发财了
selling them to everyone we know.

121
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,100
至于现在...
Now...

122
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,360
我只需要
all I need to do

123
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,100
到楼下的光盘店
is head down to the video store

124
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,030
把影碟还回去就行了
and return the DVD.

125
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,360
哦 我是不是忘记告诉你了?
Oh, did I forget to tell you?

126
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,900
那家店好几年前就关门了
That store went out of business years ago.

127
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,060
真的?
Really?

128
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,760
你的咪咪感觉如何?
How those nipples feeling, chief?

129
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,560
Penny 能把我俩的饮料给我们不?
Penny, can we please get our drinks?

130
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,960
好啊 稍等一下
Yeah, hang on, just give me sec.

131
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,300
今天上班的时候 我做了活体立体定位手术
At work today, I did an in vivo stereotaxic surgery.

132
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,600
高端啊 今天我在实验室里
Cool. At my lab,

133
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,460
做了十次激光捕获微切割
I performed ten laser capture micro-dissections.

134
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,830
我今天从那张桌子底下扣下来了一块口香糖
I scraped gum off the bottom of that table.

135
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,760
就因为经理看见是我粘在那的
Only because my manager saw me put it there.

136
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,730
天啊
Oh, my gosh.

137
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,760
她就是那个让Rajesh伤心欲绝的女孩
That's the girl that broke Rajesh's heart.

138
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,130
是Lucy?
That's Lucy?

139
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:44,060
我不知道为什么 但是我总把她想象成印度人
I don't know why but I always pictured her as Indian.

140
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,800
貌似这就叫种族歧视吧
I think that reason's called racism.

141
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,600
我要去跟她聊聊
I'm gonna go talk to her.

142
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,430
为什么? 你想说什么啊?
Why? What are you gonna say?

143
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,560
我不会乱说的
I'm not gonna say anything.

144
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,830
我就是想去见见她
I just want to check her out

145
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:53,900
因为她伤害了我朋友
because she hurt my friend.

146
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,530
我的印度朋友
My Indian friend.

147
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,030
现在是谁种族歧视?
Who's racist now?

148
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:00,030
你啊 因为你刚把他叫做你的
You because you just called him

149
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:03,130
"印度朋友"
your "Indian friend."

150
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,630
好吧 总之你长不高
Yeah, well, you're short.

151
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,800
我们再也喝不上饮料了
We're never getting our drinks.

152
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,800
反正也不抱期望
No, but we knew that.

153
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,100
嗨 想先喝点什么呢?
Hey, can I start you off with something to drink?

154
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,460
哦 水就行
Oh, water would be great.

155
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,530
好的
Okay.

156
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,860
呃 你是Lucy?
Um, you're Lucy, right?

157
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,460
我是Raj Koothrappali的朋友
I'm a friend of Raj Koothrappali's.

158
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,100
其实是Amy认出来的你
Actually Amy recognized you.

159
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,530
哇
Wow.

160
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,030
他现在怎么样?
How's he doing?

161
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,460
哦 你懂的啊 还好啦
Oh, you know, he's good.

162
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,630
那就好
Great.

163
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,730
其实 这事跟我没什么关系
Yeah, this is none of my business.

164
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:41,130
不过 你为什么要用发邮件的方式跟他分手?
But why did you break up with him in an e-mail?

165
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,760
我也不知道
Oh, I don't know.

166
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,430
可能就是觉得这样比较容易吧
I guess I thought it would be easier.

167
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,160
好吧 我懂了
Yeah, I get that.

168
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,500
我去给你拿杯水
I'll go get you your water.

169
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,930
你说"容易"的意思是
When you say "easier,"

170
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,700
这对于你来说更容易 对吧?
you mean easier for you, right?

171
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,900
因为显然对他来说这根本不容易
Because it certainly didn't make it easier for him.

172
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,630
我能不能
Any chance I can get

173
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:02,160
换个服务员?
a different waitress?

174
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,260
对... 对不起 是我不好
I... I'm sorry, this is rude of me.

175
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,330
我去给你拿水
I will go get that water.

176
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:08,300
你看 你看 你看
See, see, see, see.

177
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,660
就在刚才 你面对面地告诉我你的感受了
Just now you expressed your feelings to my face.

178
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,560
为什么你能这么面对我 却不能这么面对Raj?
How come you could do that with me, but not Raj?

179
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,960
因为我不知道你的邮箱啊
I don't know your e-mail.

180
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,530
你知道最糟糕的是什么吗?
You know what the worst part is?

181
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:18,860
你现在开开心心地坐在这里
You're sitting here, perfectly happy

182
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,860
他却窝在家里哭成一团
and he's at home, a blubbering mess.

183
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,360
哦 你刚才不是说他挺好的嘛
Oh, I thought you said he was okay.

184
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,600
是啊 我还说要给你拿水呢
Well, I also said I was getting you water,

185
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,360
我不还是站在这里么
but look at me still standing here.

186
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,330
知道吗 我可能不是个好服务员
You know, I may be a bad waitress,

187
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,060
但你根本就是个坏人
but you are a bad person.

188
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,400
现在 要听听今天的特价菜是什么吗?
Now, you want to hear the specials?

189
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,830
所以你永远不能脱下来?
So, you can never take it off?

190
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,500
不能
No.

191
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,800
睡觉的时候也不行?
Not even to sleep?

192
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,230
不行
No.

193
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,260
你简直就是个白痴
So, you're just an idiot?

194
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:04,460
这是在摆明立场
It's called proving a point.

195
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,500
那立场就是你是个白痴?
Is the point you're an idiot?

196
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,260
先生们 听我说
Gentlemen, please.

197
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:13,200
Leonard正在努力感同身受呢(直译为穿我的鞋)
Leonard is trying to walk a mile in my metaphorical shoes.

198
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,230
他穿不了我真实的鞋
He can't walk in my actual shoes.

199
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:17,360
他那脚只能穿童鞋呢
He has the feet of a toddler.

200
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,160
要是那家店已经停业了的话
So, how are you gonna return the DVD

201
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,500
你打算怎么还光盘?
if the store went out of business?

202
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,600
周一早上我要去趟市中心
Monday morning I'll go downtown

203
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,830
找找店主的信息
look up the owner's information.

204
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:30,530
然后把光盘寄给他
And send him the DVD.

205
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:34,030
再把罚款交了
Pay the late fee.

206
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,930
这样 我就可以向Sheldon证明
And prove to Sheldon

207
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,060
不用那么抓狂...
that you can have a problem and solve it...

208
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,600
也可以发现并解决问题了
without acting like a complete lunatic.

209
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,000
哈!
Ah!

210
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,660
扮狗熊的人还想让每个人都知道(指美国林务局的吉祥物Smokey熊)
And the man impersonating a bear would like everyone

211
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,730
"只有你能防止森林火灾"呢
to know that "Only you can prevent forest fires."

212
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,760
什么意思
I don't get it.

213
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,600
你们印度没有Smokey熊吗?
You didn't have Smokey the Bear in India?

214
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,830
没有 哦 他是不是和猫鼬萌萌差不多?
No. Oh, is he anything like, uh, Mun-Mun the Mongoose?

215
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,260
萌萌告诉我们不要招惹眼镜蛇
He taught us not to play with cobras.

216
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,930
不要招惹眼镜蛇还用人教?
You had to be taught not to play with cobras?

217
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,230
还有人教你们
You had to be taught

218
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:11,260
不能烧了森林呢 对吧?
not to burn down the forest?

219
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,160
嘿 你们要是饿了的话
Hey, if you guys were hungry, why didn't you order

220
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,530
为什么在餐厅的时候不要点吃的?
something at the restaurant?

221
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,460
我们要了 你一直没给我们啊
We did, you never brought it.

222
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:29,200
哦 想起来了
Oh, that's right.

223
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,230
是栗米脆饼和火鸡
Nachos and a turkey club.

224
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,830
差的也太远了吧
Not even close.

225
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,700
我是忙着给朋友出气
Well, I was too busy standing up

226
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,330
才忘了你们的...
for my friend to worry about your...

227
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:39,500
我想想该说什么
I want to say

228
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,730
是三文鱼吧
salmon.

229
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:43,300
还是说对不起吧
You want to say sorry.

230
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,860
你要怎么跟Raj说你干的好事?
So, how are you gonna tell Raj abut what you did?

231
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,500
什么叫"怎么说"? 这有什么大不了的?
What do you mean "how"? What's the big deal?

232
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,560
你跟Lucy说Raj现在可怜兮兮 生活一团糟
You told Lucy he was a pathetic mess.

233
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,760
后来你还把人家弄哭了 气走了
Then you made her cry and leave.

234
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,700
好啦 你们太小题大做了
Okay, you guys are overreacting.

235
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,200
我为Raj报了一箭之仇 他会感谢我的
Raj is gonna appreciate how I had his back.

236
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,660
你脑子被驴踢了吗 Penny?
What is wrong with you, Penny?!

237
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,360
我跟Lucy重修旧好的机会
You ruined any chance I had

238
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,000
都让你给毁了!
of getting back with Lucy!

239
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,160
现在她实实在在知道我是个惨兮兮的可怜虫啦
Now she knows I'm a desperate mess

240
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,460
以前她只不过是很肯定而已
instead of just being pretty sure!

241
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:15,300
是Lucy
It's Lucy.

242
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,130
她想约我喝咖啡
She wants to meet for coffee.

243
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:19,200
爱死你啦 Penny!
I love you, Penny!

244
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:26,200
嘿 在忙什么呢?
Hey, what're you working on?

245
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,360
我在想
I'm thinking about

246
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,200
高速旋转的镜子
how one could use the fact

247
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,060
能让假光子变成成真的光子
that a rapidly rotating mirror

248
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,260
那我们是否可以利用这种现象
turns virtual photons into real ones

249
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,230
来探索观察暗能量的方法呢
as a method of observing dark energy.

250
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,960
这想法很酷
That's a pretty cool idea.

251
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,000
耶 你来得正好
Yeah. It's great you're here.

252
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,530
我想听听工程师的看法
I'd love to get an engineer's opinion.

253
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:43,800
没问题
Sure.

254
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,160
这把椅子老是咯吱咯吱响
This chair is squeaky.

255
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,100
能修好吗? 不行我再换一把
Now, do I fix it or get a new one?

256
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,060
啊哈 Sheldon 我浪费了一早上的时间
Well, Sheldon, it took me all morning,

257
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,530
找到那家影碟店的老板了
but I found the owner of the video store.

258
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:01,260
但是 听好了 他已经死翘翘了 喝醉后安详地睡死过去了
And I am happy to report that he died peacefully in his sleep,

259
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,260
沉到了游泳池底部
drunk at the bottom of a pool.

260
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,700
总之就是 这张DVD还不回去了
Anyway, there is no one to return the DVD to,

261
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,400
所以 跟你的恩怨到此结束
so this issue is resolved.

262
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,560
哈...
Ah...

263
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:16,500
我还想说
And I'd just like to point out that

264
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,030
虽然这件毛衣快把我扎死了
even though the sweater was uncomfortable,

265
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,560
我也没有以此为借口
I didn't use it as an excuse

266
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,100
找身边任何人的茬儿
to antagonize everyone around me.

267
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,960
貌似你可以还给
You know, you could reimburse

268
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,560
影碟店老板的某个亲戚啊
the video store owner's next of kin.

269
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,060
我说了到此结束!
Or it's resolved!

270
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,630
嘿 Haward的主意听起来很不错哦
Hey, that next of kin thing sounds pretty good.

271
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,310
给你 不谢
This is yours.

272
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,000
问你俩一个问题
Can I ask you guys a question?

273
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
我明天晚上要见Lucy
So, I'm seeing Lucy tomorrow night,

274
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,700
我还从没跟已经跟我分手的人约会过
and I've never hung out with someone who broke up with me.

275
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,060
该怎么做呢
How do you do it?

276
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,530
别让她知道你被她伤害了
You can't let her know you're hurting.

277
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:55,060
关键是自信
You know, the key is confidence.

278
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,530
为什么关键总是自信?
Why is the key always confidence?

279
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:00,860
怎么从来都不是腰上的赘肉和紧张出来的汗呢?
How come it's never love handles and flop sweat?

280
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,500
这个女孩伤你那么深
If this girl hurt you so much,

281
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,900
你确定还想见她?
are you sure you want to see her again?

282
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,260
呃 容我插一句
Well, if I may...

283
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,760
他几乎没啥自尊
he has so little self-respect

284
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,900
又极其渴望
and is so desperate

285
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,400
哪怕是一星半点的关爱
for the smallest crumb of affection,

286
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,230
Lucy就算是跟他老爹滚床单
she could literally sleep with his own father

287
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,360
并且把视频传到YouTube上
in his own bed and post the video to YouTube,

288
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,630
这笨蛋还会给她买花
and he'd still buy her flowers

289
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,630
向她求婚呢
and ask her to be his bride.

290
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,930
没错
He's right.

291
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,600
但是 叫我说啊 是可忍
But in my defense, if we could survive that,

292
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,530
孰不可忍
we could survive anything.

293
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:32,730
好吧 既然你确定你想见她
Well, if you're sure you want to do this,

294
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:33,730
那就只是喝喝咖啡
it's only coffee...

295
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,800
心态放轻松 顺其自然吧
just relax and see what happens.

296
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,860
那 我能夸她漂亮不?
Well, can I say she looks nice?

297
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,700
当然
Sure.

298
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,330
我能告诉她我想她了吗？
Can I tell her I miss her?

299
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:42,330
看情况 要是她问的话
Maybe, if she asks.

300
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,130
哦 我能让她看看我画的一幅油画吗?
Oh, can I show her an oil painting I made

301
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,830
上面画着我俩儿孙绕膝
of us surrounded by our children and grandchildren?

302
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,730
还是下次约会再看吧
I'd save that for the second date.

303
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,130
好主意 好主意
Good, good.

304
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,800
我反复试了很多次
'Cause no matter how hard I try,

305
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,300
还是没能把那对双胞胎画得一样
I cannot get the twins to look alike.

306
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,930
你在干嘛？
What are you doing?

307
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:07,660
噢 我要找到那个傻叉老板的
Oh, I'm just trying to find the stupid next of kin

308
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,730
傻叉亲戚
to this stupid video store owner

309
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,500
这样我就可以归还那张影碟
so I can return the DVD

310
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,130
看到Sheldon脸上的傻叉表情了
and see the look on Sheldon's stupid face

311
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:16,060
我要让他知道 这点儿事哪能难倒我
when he sees that I didn't let this get to me.

312
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,760
Sheldon又不在这儿
Sheldon's not here.

313
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,060
为啥不把毛衣脱了呢?
Why don't you take the sweater off?

314
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,830
这-这-这是原则问题!
Th-Th-There's a principle at stake!

315
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,200
- 什么原则?  - 噢 不知道
- Which is?  - Oh, I don't know.

316
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,500
很重要吗? 看看我!
Who cares? Look at me!

317
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,030
噢 老天爷!
Oh, my God!

318
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,660
那是件毛衣 还是个蜂窝啊
Is that sweater made of bees?

319
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,800
快点 脱下来 我不会出卖你的
Come on, take it off. I won't tell.

320
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,060
不 不行 亲爱的 要是我脱了 Sheldon就赢了
No, no, honey, if I take it off, Sheldon wins.

321
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,400
亲
Sweetie...

322
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,260
每天晚上你没在他熟睡的时候杀了他
every night you don't kill him in his sleep,

323
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,060
就已经是他赢了
he wins.

324
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,360
哎呀 就-就快熬到头了
Nah, i-it's... it's almost done.

325
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,900
我 我只用找到
I just, I have to find...

326
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,060
他的亲戚 把影碟还回去
the next of kin, and send 'em the DVD

327
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,160
接下来就皱着个苦瓜脸等某人来
and then just wait for someone with my complexion to die

328
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,060
然后我就去做个制皮手术
so I can get a skin graft.

329
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,460
笑
Smile.

330
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,700
干啥-什么呀?
What-what is that?

331
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,700
拍我干啥?
What is that for?

332
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,200
发给普利斯顿大学
So you can send it to Princeton

333
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,860
把你交的学费要回来（这么笨 学都白上了）
and get your money back.

334
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:04,400
不得不说 Sheldon
I must say, Sheldon,

335
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,100
DVD这件事你处理得相当老练
you're handling this DVD business

336
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,800
叫人佩服呀
with an impressive amount of maturity.

337
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,230
真奇怪 这你都会觉得惊喜
I don't know why that surprises you.

338
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,330
我已经是个成年人了
I'm a grown man.

339
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:13,700
从我这身行头不也能看出来嘛
As should be evident by this sport coat

340
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,400
短外套 翻领上别一朵高仿花朵
and very real flower in my lapel.

341
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,600
你正在使用什么新的问题应对机制吗?
Is there some kind of new coping mechanism you're employing?

342
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,900
你更应该问
The more interesting question you should be asking is:

343
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,730
"这朵花什么味道?"
"What does this flower smell like?"

344
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:29,630
我猜是悲伤的味道
I'm gonna go with sad.

345
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:32,160
说说是怎么回事
So what's the story

346
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,600
你和这DVD到底怎么了?
with you and this DVD?

347
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,130
没什么
There's nothing to tell.

348
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:37,230
我买了一本书
Maybe I purchased a book entitled,

349
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,730
题目叫"不要为小事苦恼"
Don't Sweat the Small Stuff

350
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:41,460
它里面的建议挺不错的
and I followed its wise suggestions,

351
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,730
其中有一条:
one of which was:

352
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:44,800
停下来闻闻花香
stop and smell the flowers.

353
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,700
真的吗?
Seriously?

354
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,730
求你了
Please.

355
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,160
哈哈!
Ha-ha!

356
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,960
哦
Oh.

357
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,400
- 嗨  - 你好
- Hi.  - Hello.

358
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,330
见到你真高兴
Oh, it's so good to see you.

359
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:10,500
我也是
You, too.

360
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,500
请坐吧
Please, sit.

361
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,130
我给你点了一杯卡布奇诺
I, uh, I got you a cappuccino.

362
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,430
我记得这是你的最爱
I remembered it was your favorite.

363
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:17,160
哦 我还点了面包屑
Oh. I also got crumb cake,

364
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,530
但后来想起来这是我的最爱 所以我就把它吃了
but I remembered it was my favorite and I ate it.

365
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,530
好吧 你怎么样?
Anyway, uh, how are you?

366
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:25,360
还不错
I'm pretty good.

367
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,900
真是很抱歉
Listen, I just wanted to apologize

368
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,160
用电子邮件跟你分手
for breaking up with you in an e-mail.

369
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,330
我把面包屑全吃掉了
Well, and I ate all the crumb cake.

370
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,100
我们都有做的不好的地方嘛
We both made mistakes.

371
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,060
好吧
Okay.

372
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,100
你约我出来太让我高兴了
I'm so happy you asked me here,

373
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,930
希望以后我们也能常一起出来玩
and I hope we can hang out again sometime.

374
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:40,360
就像朋友那样
You know, as friends,

375
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,200
或是炮友神马的
lovemaking partners, whatever.

376
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,500
哦...
Oh, uh...

377
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,730
我已经有对象了
I'm kind of seeing someone.

378
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,400
我知道这显而易见
I think I know the answer to this,

379
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,800
不过还是想确认一下 你说的不是我 是吧?
but just to be clear, it's not me, right?

380
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,360
这都怪你!
This is all your fault!

381
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,960
我应该听萌萌的话
I should've listened to Mun-Mun

382
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,430
因为我竟然和眼镜蛇一起玩
because I've been playing with a cobra

383
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,130
她叫Penny!
and her name is Penny!

384
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,000
你怎么那么残忍?
Why are you so cruel?

385
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,760
看到我心碎你很开心吗?
Do you enjoy my pain?

386
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,830
起司蛋糕店有个女孩 我可以介绍给你认识
There's a girl at the Cheesecake Factory I can set you up with.

387
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,900
爱死你了 Penny!
I love you, Penny!

388
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:18,030
为什么我能解释清楚
How is it I can conceptualize a methodology

389
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:20,560
检测宇宙黑暗物质的方法论
of examining dark matter in the universe

390
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,900
却搞不明白怎么修好一朵喷水花?
but can't figure out how to fix a novelty squirt flower?

391
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,000
其实问题在于
I think the real question is,

392
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,330
你为什么要浪费时间修理这个小孩子的玩意儿?
why do you waste your time with cheap, childish pranks?

393
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,630
这是一个很深奥的问题
There's probably a deep reason.

394
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,930
我想一边品尝花生碎
Which I'd be happy to discuss with you

395
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:36,000
一边与你探讨
over some peanut brittle in a can.

396
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,900
好吧 Sheldon 我受够了!
Okay, Sheldon, I am out of options!

397
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,860
音像店老板Nursis Manookian
Video store owner, Nursis Manookian,

398
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,500
根本没有亲属!
has no next of kin!

399
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,460
你看起来有点热...
Well, you seem hot under the collar...

400
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,560
是因为毛衣吗?
or is that the sweater?

401
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,100
哦 不 不
Oh, oh, no, no.

402
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,130
是因为整个下午
It... It's because I spent all afternoon

403
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:55,460
都在亚美尼亚教堂参加他的葬礼
at the Armenian church where his funeral mass was held.

404
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,430
听Solakian神父说
According to Father Solakian,

405
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:58,900
没有别人会去
no one attended.

406
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,900
还好我没有白走一趟
Luckily, my trip wasn't a complete waste.

407
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,560
我点了根蜡烛 祈祷上帝快点把你带走
I lit a candle and prayed for your death.

408
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,960
但我不是亚美尼亚人 所以应该不灵验!
But I'm not Armenian, so it probably won't work!

409
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,930
这事结了 是吧?
This is over, right?

410
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,860
还不一定
Oh, not necessarily.

411
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,560
我建议
I suggest

412
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,560
你去亚米尼亚或是黎巴嫩
you look for long-lost relatives

413
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,800
寻一下亲
either in Armenia or Lebanon.

414
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,460
听着 Sheldon
Listen to me, Sheldon.

415
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,630
我不会去黎巴嫩
I am not going to Lebanon

416
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:27,330
只为还"超级玛丽兄弟"这部电影!
to return Super Mario Bros. the movie!

417
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:31,000
或许很有意思呢
You know, it might be fun.

418
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,460
你喜欢鹰嘴豆泥
You love hummus.

419
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,030
为什么你不烦恼?
Why isn't this bothering you?

420
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:38,400
难道你心里就不会不安吗?
It... Isn't your brain getting itchy?

421
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,800
这是用你的卡租的
This is on your card.

422
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,200
这会给你带来不良信用记录的!
This could be ruining your credit score!

423
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,730
你怎么能忍呢?
Why isn't this making you crazy?

424
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:50,730
Leonard 听着...
Leonard...

425
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:53,030
我要跟你说件事
I have something to tell you,

426
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:56,000
但你要答应我 别发疯
but I want you to promise not to flip out.

427
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,400
什么事?
What?

428
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,700
七年前
Seven years ago,

429
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,660
我发现这个DVD租期到了
I found out the DVD was late

430
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,860
于是就把它买了下来
and I paid for it.

431
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,960
再说一遍?
What?

432
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,860
我本来想告诉你的
I was going to mention it at the time,

433
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:20,060
但后来又想 有一天
but then I thought, some day,

434
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:23,030
可能这个能给某人一点教训
this might be a teachable moment.

435
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,230
啊...
Hah...

436
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,800
我... 你...
I... you...

437
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,200
怎么...
How can...

438
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,260
怎么?!
What?!

439
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:57,260
哦 Sheldon...
Sheldon...

440
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,860
这么做太坏了
that was diabolical.

441
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,060
我知道
I know.

442
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,030
太艰辛了
And it wasn't easy.

443
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,630
苦等了这么多年
Do you have any idea what it's like

444
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:08,000
只想看谁能笑到最后
to wait for years and never know

445
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,570
你知道这有多难熬吗?
who would finally get satisfaction?

446
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:22,900
哇
Wow.

447
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,730
你比Penny说的还漂亮
You're even prettier than Penny said.

448
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,000
难以置信
I can't believe

449
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,600
你这样的女孩竟然没有男朋友
a girl like you doesn't have a boyfriend.

450
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,930
确实没有
Well, I don't.

451
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,860
我才不信 你这个骗子!
I don't believe you, you're lying to me!

452
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,060
你说什么?
What?

453
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,400
哦 没什么
Oh, it's okay.

454
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,100
我已经寂寞得没有节操了
I have no morals and I'm desperately lonely.

455
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,360
如果你喜欢踏两只船
I'll be the other man

456
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,130
我也觉得无所谓啊
if you want a little something-something on the side.

457
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:41,960
你脑袋被驴踢了吧?!
What is wrong with you?!

458
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,630
你脑袋被驴踢了吧?!
What is wrong with you?!

459
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:45,460
你脑袋被驴踢了吧?!
What is wrong with you?!

460
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:48,460
