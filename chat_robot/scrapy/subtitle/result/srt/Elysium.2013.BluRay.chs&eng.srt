00:20:56,681 --> 00:20:59,129
34号炉门关闭！
Closing 34!

283
00:21:06,615 --> 00:21:08,766
门禁故障

284
00:21:09,238 --> 00:21:12,534
注意，炉门未关闭，请检查
Attention, doors are not aligned. Worker attend.

285
00:21:17,335 --> 00:21:20,540
嘿，别偷懒
Hey, you're holding up the line.

286
00:21:20,992 --> 00:21:23,307
不，我没有，门卡住了！
No, no, I got a jam!

287
00:21:23,673 --> 00:21:26,621
注意：值班时使用厕所不得超过一次…
Attention: workers may not use the restroom more than once per sh...

288
00:21:26,673 --> 00:21:28,430
你都干了什么把门弄坏了？
What've you done to close up?

289
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:30,133
没有，我在试着重启
No, I'm just trying to reset.

290
00:21:30,135 --> 00:21:31,649
让我看看
Let me look.

291
00:21:33,071 --> 00:21:35,111
- 卡到货板了   - 是啊，动不了了
- The pallet's pinched. - Yeah, It didn't move.

292
00:21:35,112 --> 00:21:37,486
- 进去修好   - 不，我是指…
- Just go in there. - No, I mean...

293
00:21:37,489 --> 00:21:39,789
听着，要么进去给我弄好…
Look, you go in there right now...

294
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:41,088
要么我找想弄的人来
or we'll find someone who will,

295
00:21:41,088 --> 00:21:42,588
然后你走人
and you can go clean out your locker.

296
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,567
别这样，伙计
Come on, man.

297
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:45,220
就这样 你去修，明白？
Not. That's the deal, OK?

298
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:46,474
快去！
In you go!

299
00:21:50,877 --> 00:21:53,086
加把劲，干活！
C'mon people, work!

300
00:21:55,236 --> 00:21:56,907
见鬼
Fuck.

301
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:24,227
不，不，不，停下！
No, no, no, stop!

302
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,101
探测到有机组织 K-34

303
00:22:44,702 --> 00:22:47,853
快点！去干活！
Come on! Go work!

304
00:22:47,903 --> 00:22:49,278
来不及了！
Too late!

305
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:54,253
清场！
Extraction!

306
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:26,229
嬷嬷，他们打我
Sister, they beat me up.

307
00:23:27,209 --> 00:23:29,786
我只想去那儿生活
I only want to live there.

308
00:23:31,612 --> 00:23:34,491
从这里看那儿很美吧？
See how beautiful it looks to us down here?

309
00:23:35,524 --> 00:23:37,066
是啊
Yes.

310
00:23:39,211 --> 00:23:40,544
那么…
Well, now...

311
00:23:40,546 --> 00:23:44,124
从那里看地球也很美
See how beautiful we look to them up there.

312
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:47,713
拿着
Keep this.

313
00:23:47,714 --> 00:23:50,353
我把它给你
Now it belongs to you.

314
00:23:50,713 --> 00:23:54,624
这样你就不会忘记你是从哪儿来的了
So you never forget where you come from.

315
00:24:12,087 --> 00:24:13,358
什么情况？
What happened?

316
00:24:14,105 --> 00:24:17,267
你遭到了致命辐射
You have been exposed to a lethal dose of radiation.

317
00:24:17,286 --> 00:24:20,777
你的身体器官将会严重衰竭
You will experience catastrophic organ failure.

318
00:24:20,956 --> 00:24:23,760
你会在五天之内死亡
In five days time, you will die.

319
00:24:33,436 --> 00:24:34,608
发生什么事了？
What is going on?

320
00:24:34,608 --> 00:24:36,368
为什么生产线停了？
Why has production stopped?

321
00:24:37,048 --> 00:24:39,303
- 他被辐射了…   - 别对着我呼吸
- He's been exposed... - Don't breathe on me.

322
00:24:39,387 --> 00:24:41,489
- 捂住你的嘴   - 对不起，老板
- Cover your mouth. - I'm sorry, sir.

323
00:24:50,325 --> 00:24:53,769
他会脱皮之类的吗？
Does his skin fall off, or something?

324
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:55,775
我可不想把床换掉
I don't want to replace the bedding in there.

325
00:24:55,775 --> 00:24:56,517
赶紧把他丢出去
Just get him out.

326
00:24:56,728 --> 00:24:58,866
- 遵命，老板   - 很好，谢谢
- Yes, sir. - Right, thank you.

327
00:24:58,991 --> 00:25:02,225
卡莱尔先生，您的飞船已经准备就绪
Mr. Carlyle, your shuttle is ready for departure.

328
00:25:07,927 --> 00:25:11,326
请在药品接收单上签字
Please sign this to receive medication.

329
00:25:19,281 --> 00:25:21,835
迈普龙… 药效很强

330
00:25:21,837 --> 00:25:24,836
死前会维持你的身体机能运转

331
00:25:25,189 --> 00:25:27,778
配合三餐服用
Please take one pill with each meal.

332
00:25:28,004 --> 00:25:29,967
感谢你的服务
Thank you for your service.

333
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:43,268
昨天下午三点
At 15:00 hours yesterday

334
00:25:43,268 --> 00:25:45,436
你击落了两架飞船
you shot down two shuttles,

335
00:25:45,436 --> 00:25:47,063
造成46人死亡
killing 46 civilians.

336
00:25:47,233 --> 00:25:50,033
对于那些非法移民，你应该采取秘密措施
Your mandate is to deal with illegals 'quietly'.

337
00:25:50,035 --> 00:25:51,834
我知道
I am aware of that.

338
00:25:51,835 --> 00:25:54,860
你还启用这位探员
And then there's the use of this agent.

339
00:25:55,324 --> 00:25:57,324
克鲁格探员
A Mr. M. Kruger.

340
00:25:57,603 --> 00:26:00,148
15项侵犯人权指控…
15 human rights violations...

341
00:26:00,235 --> 00:26:02,435
强奸，绑架，虐待
Rapes, kidnapping, torture.

342
00:26:02,437 --> 00:26:05,914
这人被确诊有严重的精神问题
The man's been diagnosed with serious psychological issues.

343
00:26:05,936 --> 00:26:07,691
我们已经明确向你表过态
We made explicitly clear to you

344
00:26:08,054 --> 00:26:10,836
不再启用潜伏探员
that we're no longer using sleeper agents.

345
00:26:10,838 --> 00:26:14,169
告诉我，帕特尔总统
Tell me something, President Patel.

346
00:26:14,633 --> 00:26:16,726
你有孩子吗？
Do you have children?

347
00:26:17,738 --> 00:26:20,372
我可不是接受质询的人
I'm not the one being reviewed here.

348
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:23,212
那我就假设你没有
Then I will assume you do not.

349
00:26:23,639 --> 00:26:26,639
或许，如果你有孩子
Perhaps, if you did have children.

350
00:26:26,641 --> 00:26:28,440
你就会觉得
Then you would behave in a manner

351
00:26:28,441 --> 00:26:32,440
这样做有利于极乐空间的长久发展
that is more conducive to the longevity of this habitat.

352
00:26:32,442 --> 00:26:33,294
我明白
I understand,

353
00:26:33,579 --> 00:26:37,641
我的做事风格不是你们想要的那种
it is not the fashion to think and to act as I do.

354
00:26:37,643 --> 00:26:39,606
我很明白
I understand that perfectly.

355
00:26:40,085 --> 00:26:42,774
但当他们来抢你的房子时…
But when they come for your house...

356
00:26:42,776 --> 00:26:45,103
或者你为你孩子建造的房子
or the house you built for your children.

357
00:26:45,143 --> 00:26:47,148
和你子孙的房子时…
And your children's children...

358
00:26:47,243 --> 00:26:51,343
什么公共关系和竞选承诺可阻止不了他们
It won't be PR or campaign promises that keep them out.

359
00:26:51,345 --> 00:26:52,974
我能！
It will be me!

360
00:26:52,994 --> 00:26:56,041
我听够了！这是给你的最后警告
I've heard enough! This is your final warning.

361
00:26:56,067 --> 00:26:57,906
只要再有什么未授权的越界行为
Any further unauthorized actions,

362
00:26:57,906 --> 00:26:59,855
你将会被清除出内阁
and you will be removed from office.

363
00:26:59,856 --> 00:27:03,963
永久解除克鲁格的探员职务
And let's discharge this agent Kruger permanently.

364
00:27:04,074 --> 00:27:06,131
全体通过吗？
All in favour?

365
00:27:07,247 --> 00:27:10,323
很好 决议立即生效
Good. Effective immediately.

366
00:27:11,208 --> 00:27:13,200
协议

367
00:27:18,823 --> 00:27:21,188
代码更新
克鲁格探员已解职

368
00:27:28,472 --> 00:27:30,081
想来点啤酒吗？
You want some beer?

369
00:27:39,688 --> 00:27:42,738
你已被CCB解职
You have been discharged from CCB.

370
00:27:42,738 --> 00:27:45,764
请把所有武器交还至当地大使馆
Please return all weapons to local embassy

371
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:50,299
去你的政客！去你的！
Fuck your 'Politikster'! Fuck you!

372
00:28:02,619 --> 00:28:03,833
快看…
Look...

373
00:28:05,427 --> 00:28:06,390
麦克斯…
Max...

374
00:28:10,749 --> 00:28:11,744
麦克斯！
Max!

375
00:28:13,974 --> 00:28:15,651
怎么了？出了什么事？
What's wrong? What happened?

376
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:18,842
天哪，我扶你，走吧
Jesus, let me help you. Let's go.

377
00:28:21,444 --> 00:28:23,278
麦克斯，发生了什么事？
Max, what happened?

378
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,297
麦克斯，发生什么事了？
Max, what happened?

379
00:28:25,297 --> 00:28:27,393
我就不该进去
I shouldn't have gone in it.

380
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:30,445
进哪儿去？
Gone in where?

381
00:28:33,991 --> 00:28:37,863
我遭到了强辐射，伙计
I took a full dose, man.

382
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,078
致命剂量的
Lethal dose.

383
00:28:40,963 --> 00:28:43,562
你还好吧？我来帮你
You OK? Let me help.

384
00:28:45,004 --> 00:28:46,203
你会好起来的，麦克斯
You're gonna be OK, Max.

385
00:28:46,945 --> 00:28:48,997
他们给了我一瓶药
They gave me Miporol, man.

386
00:28:50,837 --> 00:28:55,754
就给了一瓶… 药
They gave me... Miporol.

387
00:28:57,207 --> 00:28:58,833
我只剩五天活头啦！
I got five fucking days!

388
00:28:59,689 --> 00:29:01,774
我只剩下五天了！
I only got five days!

389
00:29:01,819 --> 00:29:03,732
你得吃药
You have to take this.

390
00:29:04,668 --> 00:29:07,332
在极乐空间就能治好
They can fix this shit on Elysium, man.

391
00:29:08,208 --> 00:29:08,967
我知道
I know.

392
00:29:08,968 --> 00:29:12,390
- 我得去找斯派德  - 麦克斯，麦克斯！
- Gonna go see Spider. - Max, Max!

393
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:14,622
赶紧把药吃了！
Take the pill!

394
00:29:18,269 --> 00:29:19,987
给你水！
There you go!

395
00:29:20,769 --> 00:29:23,455
要见斯派德，得花钱
To see Spider, you need money.

396
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:25,741
就算搭上我的全部家当
I'll give you everything I have,

397
00:29:25,741 --> 00:29:27,813
也买不起票啊
but it's not enough for a ticket.

398
00:29:28,271 --> 00:29:30,832
他会给我票的
He's going to give me a ticket.

399
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:34,653
绝对会给我的
He's gonna give me a fucking ticket.

400
00:29:36,987 --> 00:29:40,373
弗蕾，我们已经尽全力救治你的女儿了
Frey, you know we've done everything we could to help your daughter.

401
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,129
但是今天我和院方高层碰了头
But I had a meeting today with the board,

402
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:43,853
他们建议我把她送回家
and they're recommending that we send her home with you.

403
00:29:43,873 --> 00:29:46,450
把她留在家里我还怎么工作？
How can I work here and leave it at home?

404
00:29:46,453 --> 00:29:48,252
你清楚她的病随时会发作，法伊泽尔医生
You know it can happen anytime, Dr. Faizel.

405
00:29:48,377 --> 00:29:50,457
我知道，如果她再突然发作
I know, if she has another seizure,

406
00:29:50,457 --> 00:29:52,191
我们就把她送回家
of course bring her back here.

407
00:29:52,504 --> 00:29:55,419
但到那个时候她就没救了
But until then she's discharged.

408
00:29:55,805 --> 00:29:57,471
这里不是极乐空间
This isn't Elysium.

409
00:29:57,471 --> 00:29:59,388
我们没办法治
We can't just heal her.

410
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,736
麦克斯！
Max!

411
00:30:44,165 --> 00:30:46,084
好久不见啊，兄弟！
It's been a while, my brother!

412
00:30:46,713 --> 00:30:49,184
上班的日子如何？
How's life at the factory?

413
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,496
我需要你帮个忙
I need to ask you a favour.

414
00:30:51,496 --> 00:30:53,373
什么？我听不见 什么？
What? I can't hear you. What?

415
00:30:54,238 --> 00:30:57,356
我需要一张票 去极乐空间
I need a ticket. Up there.

416
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:58,511
和一个身份证
And an ID.

417
00:31:01,186 --> 00:31:03,111
行，没问题
Yeah, sure sure.

418
00:31:04,575 --> 00:31:07,747
没说的，你想要过道的位置还是靠窗的？
Absolutely. You prefer aisle or window?

419
00:31:07,788 --> 00:31:11,185
别耍我，我是认真的，伙计
Don't play games with me. I'm fucking serious, man.

420
00:31:11,188 --> 00:31:14,787
听着，我会回来为你工作的
Listen, I'm gonna come back and work for you.

421
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:19,977
听凭差遣，我会还你钱的
Anything you need. I'll fucking pay it back.

422
00:31:20,103 --> 00:31:21,820
知道吗？
You know what?

423
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:25,566
这… 可是…
This... is...

424
00:31:25,591 --> 00:31:27,528
无价的
priceless.

425
00:31:28,791 --> 00:31:32,673
这可是无价的
This is priceless.

426
00:31:32,675 --> 00:31:34,251
让我问你个问题
Yeah, let me ask you a question.

427
00:31:34,692 --> 00:31:38,052
你知道有多少蠢货
Do you have any idea how many idiots

428
00:31:38,054 --> 00:31:41,505
跑到这里和我说着同样的话吗？
come in here saying the same kinda bullshit?

429
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:45,972
每天都有一群小屁孩儿过来找我
I got little kids coming here every day.

430
00:31:45,994 --> 00:31:47,949
麦克斯，我要是你
Max, if I were you,

431
00:31:47,949 --> 00:31:51,764
我会立刻滚出去
I'd get the fuck out of here, right now

432
00:31:54,595 --> 00:31:56,016
我替你卖了3年命
I did 3 years for you.

433
00:31:56,016 --> 00:31:57,622
整整3年
Everything I did for you,

434
00:31:57,622 --> 00:31:59,415
你必须把我送上去
you're gonna get me up there.

435
00:31:59,446 --> 00:32:00,279
开枪吧
Go ahead and shoot.

436
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:02,196
反正我已经被辐射了
I got so much radiation in my body, right now,

437
00:32:02,198 --> 00:32:04,547
可能你也会被传染
you're probably getting a little sick yourself.

438
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:05,690
你真的快死了？
You really dying?

439
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,632
是的，你个杂碎
I'm fucking dying, motherfucker.

440
00:32:08,098 --> 00:32:09,793
看到了吗？我把枪放下
See this? I put the gun down.

441
00:32:10,019 --> 00:32:10,444
把枪放下！
Put the gun down!

442
00:32:11,009 --> 00:32:13,241
都把枪放下！
Put the gun down!

443
00:32:13,241 --> 00:32:14,673
出去！
Get out of here!

444
00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:16,642
好吗！
Okay!

445
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:21,899
听着，我正在找人替我干一票
Listen, I've been looking for someone to take a job for me.

446
00:32:21,902 --> 00:32:25,126
但这儿没人有那个胆量
But no one here has the balls.

447
00:32:25,901 --> 00:32:29,201
你说你愿意干任何事，对吗？
You said you'd do anything, right?

448
00:32:29,251 --> 00:32:31,328
麦克斯…
Max...

449
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:41,044
- 嘿   - 我没事
- Hey. - I'm OK.

450
00:32:55,254 --> 00:32:56,373
这个…
This...

451
00:32:57,962 --> 00:32:59,453
我的朋友
My friend.

452
00:33:00,352 --> 00:33:03,669
这个就是你的票
This can be your ticket up there.

453
00:33:06,208 --> 00:33:09,777
你替我干最后一票，我就帮你上去
One last job for me, You earn your way up.

454
00:33:10,131 --> 00:33:11,387
是什么？
What is it?

455
00:33:11,766 --> 00:33:15,328
抓一个极乐空间的混蛋，明白？
Take an Elysian asshole, right?

456
00:33:15,495 --> 00:33:20,993
一个因为生意上的事来地球的亿万富翁…
A billionaire who's down on Earth for some business...

457
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,675
他是，是来这儿，管他干什么呢，我们绑了他
He's, he's here for, whatever. We hijack him.

458
00:33:23,786 --> 00:33:25,779
- 得了吧！   - 放松
- Fuck that! - Relax.

459
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:28,800
这家伙可没那么简单
The guy's like much worse.

460
00:33:28,932 --> 00:33:32,490
我们不抢表，不抢车，什么都不抢
Forget his watch, forget his ride, forget all that shit.

461
00:33:32,597 --> 00:33:35,750
就抢这个
This, is what you take.

462
00:33:38,111 --> 00:33:42,124
储存在他脑子里的有机信息
Organic Information, right out of his head.

463
00:33:42,255 --> 00:33:44,805
我说的是银行代码
I'm talking about the bank codes,

464
00:33:44,805 --> 00:33:46,606
密码，登陆数据…
passwords, login data...

465
00:33:46,714 --> 00:33:49,559
能赚上千万
Access to billions.

466
00:33:50,115 --> 00:33:52,940
你要做的就是把这个插入他的脑子里
All you have to do is plug into his brain,

467
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,831
下载数据到你脑子里…
download the data to yours with this baby...

468
00:33:56,116 --> 00:33:57,949
然后带回来给我
And bring it to me.

469
00:33:58,265 --> 00:33:59,673
这太疯狂了，麦克斯
This is crazy, Max.

470
00:33:59,692 --> 00:34:01,221
一旦我们确认数据
Once we verify the data,

471
00:34:01,978 --> 00:34:03,731
我就帮你上去
I'll give you a one way ride,

472
00:34:03,731 --> 00:34:05,053
全部免费
all expenses paid.

473
00:34:05,218 --> 00:34:08,065
还会附赠点心和饮料
Even throw in some snacks and a drink.

474
00:34:08,374 --> 00:34:11,037
你要做的就是走到房子里
All you have to do is walk into a house

475
00:34:11,201 --> 00:34:13,888
去找一张医疗床，然后你就痊愈了
and use the Med-bay, and you're cured.

476
00:34:15,063 --> 00:34:17,614
桑德罗会给你做手术，你知道他吧？
Sandro who will do the surgery. You know him?

477
00:34:17,636 --> 00:34:20,219
- 见鬼…  - 天哪！
- Fuck... - Christ!

478
00:34:20,221 --> 00:34:21,220
我很好
I'm good.

479
00:34:21,223 --> 00:34:25,241
老实说，你看起来太虚弱了
Actually, you seem all weak.

480
00:34:25,427 --> 00:34:27,048
一团糟啊，那么…
And a fucked up, so...

481
00:34:27,053 --> 00:34:30,420
知道吗？我有…
You know what? I have...

482
00:34:30,422 --> 00:34:32,796
这太疯狂了，我们走吧
It's crazy, let's get out of here,

483
00:34:32,796 --> 00:34:34,221
拜托，你就听我的吧
Please, listen to me.

484
00:34:34,361 --> 00:34:36,275
我还有的选吗？
What am I gonna do?

485
00:34:36,415 --> 00:34:38,393
我会让他们给你装上…
I'll have them install...

486
00:34:38,853 --> 00:34:40,053
这玩意儿！
this!

487
00:34:40,193 --> 00:34:42,232
第三代机械骨骼战甲
A third generation Axo-suit.

488
00:34:42,338 --> 00:34:44,353
我们把它和你的神经系统连接起来
We hook this into your nervous system,

489
00:34:44,353 --> 00:34:46,421
你就会变得和那些机器人一样强
and it'll make you as strong as a droid.

490
00:34:46,425 --> 00:34:48,625
你已经蓄势待发了，对吧？
You're already under the knife, right?

491
00:34:48,626 --> 00:34:50,625
我们走吧，求你了
Let's get out of here, please.

492
00:34:50,626 --> 00:34:53,337
我要一个四人分队，人由我来挑
I want a 4 man team. But I pick them.

493
00:34:53,408 --> 00:34:55,889
但得要有我的数据操作员
I'm sending my own data wrangler.

494
00:34:55,926 --> 00:34:59,148
大脑传输，那可不是件轻松的事啊
Brain to brain, that is real tough.

495
00:34:59,152 --> 00:35:01,548
行，但我要带上胡里奥
OK, but I'm taking Julio,

496
00:35:02,137 --> 00:35:03,915
他也得要有一张票，和我一样
he gets a ticket up there, same as me.

497
00:35:03,928 --> 00:35:05,374
可以，没问题
Yeah, sure.

498
00:35:05,378 --> 00:35:07,900
好了，我去叫人准备
OK, I'll go get the boys ready.

499
00:35:07,901 --> 00:35:09,091
等等！
Wait!

500
00:35:10,606 --> 00:35:13,480
就绑约翰·卡莱尔
It's gotta be John Carlyle.

501
00:35:14,229 --> 00:35:17,676
就是那个阿曼达因公司的首席执行官，卡莱尔？
The CEO of Armadyne, Carlyle?

502
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:20,380
就是他
That's the mark.

503
00:35:26,231 --> 00:35:29,529
德拉库特部长，卡莱尔先生到了
Secretary Delacourt, Mr. Carlyle has arrived.

504
00:35:29,581 --> 00:35:32,085
你来这儿是为了说服我
You are here to persuade me

505
00:35:32,085 --> 00:35:34,703
和你们续签阿曼达因的合同的吧？
to renew our Armadyne contracts, yes?

506
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:36,715
您是个聪明人
Astute as always.

507
00:35:37,703 --> 00:35:39,382
跟我来
Come with me.

508
00:35:46,695 --> 00:35:50,348
我对你的小算盘不感兴趣
I'm not interested in your little ideas.

509
00:35:50,425 --> 00:35:52,958
我只对“大生意”感兴趣
I am interested in something much larger.

510
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,635
这个地方正在走下坡路
This habitat is dying.

511
00:35:55,636 --> 00:35:58,494
这里的领导层不行了
There is a political sickness inside of it.

512
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,453
这块“毒瘤”必须得切除
A tumor that needs to be removed.

513
00:36:01,455 --> 00:36:06,511
你和你的公司所需要的利润正在枯竭
You and your company are in need of revenue that is drying up.

514
00:36:06,674 --> 00:36:07,927
所以…
So...

515
00:36:08,642 --> 00:36:10,663
既然是你建造的极乐空间
You built the Torus.

516
00:36:10,753 --> 00:36:12,478
能否越过服务器
Can you override the servers

517
00:36:12,478 --> 00:36:16,004
直接扶植一个新总统上台呢？
and place a new president in power?

518
00:36:18,946 --> 00:36:20,639
政变？
A coup?

519
00:36:21,841 --> 00:36:24,040
您是打算发动政变？
Are you suggesting a coup?

520
00:36:24,071 --> 00:36:25,840
有可行性吗？
Is it possible?

521
00:36:27,142 --> 00:36:29,936
我可以编写一段重启数列
I could write a reboot sequence.

522
00:36:29,942 --> 00:36:31,928
它会关闭整个系统
It'd shut down the entire system,

523
00:36:32,135 --> 00:36:34,220
到那时…
and at that point...

524
00:36:34,938 --> 00:36:37,622
您就可以任命一个新总统了
you can encode a new President, yes.

525
00:36:37,698 --> 00:36:39,629
那就赶紧去做吧
Then that is what you will do.

526
00:36:39,644 --> 00:36:44,244
而且接下来200年的合同就全都是你的了
And you will have your contract secured for the next 200 years.

527
00:36:44,246 --> 00:36:46,103
导弹防御电池，机器人
Missile Defense Batteries, Droids,

528
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:49,446
所有的一切，来保卫自由
everything we need, to protect our liberty.

529
00:36:49,447 --> 00:36:54,310
当然，新总统会兑现承诺的
All guaranteed, of course, by your new President.

530
00:37:00,947 --> 00:37:04,384
去吧！着手进行吧，卡莱尔先生
Go! Get to work, Mr. Carlyle.

531
00:37:07,605 --> 00:37:09,223
就是那个家伙
This is the guy.

532
00:37:10,642 --> 00:37:13,135
- 就是他？   - 就是他
- He's the guy? - This is him.

533
00:37:13,739 --> 00:37:15,503
坐下
Sit down.

534
00:37:17,403 --> 00:37:19,443
我们会治好你的，宝贝儿
We're gonna cut you up good, homie.

535
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:23,051
小心点儿，朋友，小心
Play nice, amigo. Play nice.

536
00:37:23,084 --> 00:37:25,250
先给他标上身份证
Let's get him an ID first.

537
00:37:25,337 --> 00:37:27,165
一组身份代码
one of them identification codes.

538
00:37:27,337 --> 00:37:29,165
准备好
Get that ready.

539
00:37:29,337 --> 00:37:31,165
胳膊抬起来
Arm up.

540
00:37:36,766 --> 00:37:38,310
它会和你的DNA结合
It'll merge with your DNA.

541
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:40,448
这样你就成合法公民了
Now you fit in.

542
00:37:40,454 --> 00:37:42,149
就像在那儿出生的一样
Like you were born there

543
00:37:43,655 --> 00:37:45,955
现在好戏开场了
Now it's time for the real fun.

544
00:37:55,657 --> 00:37:57,256
把它给我
Lower it to me.

545
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,970
嘿，伙计
Hey, man.

546
00:38:09,702 --> 00:38:11,252
会疼吗？
This gonna hurt?

547
00:38:13,259 --> 00:38:15,149
没错，会疼
Yeah bitch, it's gonna hurt.

548
00:38:15,221 --> 00:38:16,705
但是不会很疼
It's gonna hurt good.

549
00:38:16,809 --> 00:38:18,402
等我们完事儿了
When we're done with you,

550
00:38:18,402 --> 00:38:19,873
你就成忍者了
you're gonna be a ninja.

551
00:38:20,261 --> 00:38:21,374
玛丽安娜…
Mariana!...

552
00:38:21,441 --> 00:38:23,691
把骨锯给我！
Bring down the bone saw!

553
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,787
这伤不了我
This ain't gonna kill me.

554
00:38:31,263 --> 00:38:33,700
你不会有事的，不会的
You'll be airight. Not bad.

555
00:38:34,988 --> 00:38:36,136
麦克斯
Max.

556
00:38:37,484 --> 00:38:39,114
我就在这儿
I'm here.

557
00:38:40,799 --> 00:38:42,374
我们能做到的，兄弟
We got this, man.

558
00:38:42,605 --> 00:38:44,471
能吗？
We got this?

559
00:38:46,276 --> 00:38:47,462
能！
Yeah!

560
00:39:42,958 --> 00:39:44,864
他醒了！
He's awake!

561
00:39:46,558 --> 00:39:47,864
成功了？
Made it, huh?

真意外！
Surprised!

563
00:39:54,713 --> 00:39:57,277
你还能继续打飞机呢
You can still jack off, alright?

564
00:39:57,278 --> 00:39:59,171
进展如何？

一切顺利
Ready to kick ass?

566
00:40:05,425 --> 00:40:07,762
你都对我干了些什么？
What the fuck did you do to me?

567
00:40:09,489 --> 00:40:11,483
给你条活路
Gave you a way out.

568
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,175
协议重启

00:40:34,175 --> 00:40:37,650
序列完成

570
00:40:37,995 --> 00:40:40,035
想要保护这个数据吗？

571
00:40:43,828 --> 00:40:46,444

怎么样，兄弟？

Wait for it.

583
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:40,473
还有…

出发！
Move out!

587
00:41:58,378 --> 00:41:59,644

您的飞船准备好了

589
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:10,763

摄像头启动，小子们
Be back in five, boys.

599
00:42:45,299 --> 00:42:48,016
好了，我们出发，好戏开始！
Alright now, let's go! Let's play ball!

600
00:42:57,170 --> 00:42:58,819
紧张吗？
You nervous?

601
00:42:58,994 --> 00:43:00,778
-不   - 真的？

我怕得要死

临界发动机故障

608
00:44:21,126 --> 00:44:24,495
夫人，有极乐空间公民在地球遇到危险

德拉库特女士

616
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:45,471
听到您的声音可真高兴啊

有一位携带敏感资料的公民

618

正在城外

政府还不知道此事吧？
The government doesn't know about this, do they?

625
00:45:02,027 --> 00:45:04,498
这么说来我可以漫天要价了，对吧？

伙计们！我们得走了！

686
00:50:18,676 --> 00:50:19,805
我靠

Again!

704
00:51:40,737 --> 00:51:43,027
这下完了！这下全完了！
This is wrong! This is all wrong, man!

705
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,080
进入盘旋模式！
Going into holding pattern, sir!

706
00:52:36,081 --> 00:52:38,120
你认为能逃到哪？
Where do you think you're going?

707
00:53:09,821 --> 00:53:11,890
可恶！
Fuck!

708
00:53:12,015 --> 00:53:14,746
可恶！
Motherfucker!

709
00:53:17,479 --> 00:53:18,559
来啊！
Come on!

710
00:53:19,268 --> 00:53:20,480
不！
No!

711
00:53:59,795 --> 00:54:02,224
不，不！
No, no!

712
00:54:02,854 --> 00:54:05,452
不！快起来！
No! Get up!

713
00:54:12,913 --> 00:54:15,382
起来啊！
Get up!

714
00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:24,853
不！
No!

715
00:54:43,549 --> 00:54:46,582
一名反抗者正在徒步逃跑
We've got one assailant leaving on foot, ma'am.

716
00:54:46,794 --> 00:54:48,288
他们有数据
They have the data.

717
00:54:48,288 --> 00:54:50,830
重复：这些罪犯有数据
Repeat: The thieves have the data.

718
00:54:50,957 --> 00:54:53,497
不惜一切代价抓住他
Apprehend the target at all costs.

719
00:54:53,497 --> 00:54:55,240
但不要损坏他的大脑
Do not damage his brain.

720
00:54:55,246 --> 00:54:57,736
走吧！去抓住那家伙
Let's go! We got a runner, boy!

721
00:55:03,497 --> 00:55:06,325
这个公民失血过多
The citizen has suffered catastrophic blood loss

722
00:55:06,325 --> 00:55:07,768
导致心跳停止
leading to cardiac arrest

723
00:55:07,798 --> 00:55:10,997
死亡时间，17点45分
Time of death, 17:45.

724
00:55:54,995 --> 00:55:57,071
出来吧，你藏哪了
Come on, where are you hiding?

725
00:55:57,606 --> 00:55:59,461
那是什么？
What's that?

726
00:56:09,057 --> 00:56:11,488
看上去像是猪
Looks like a herd of pigs, boss.

727
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,043
可恶，找到他
Fuck you, man! Find him!

728
00:56:14,068 --> 00:56:16,823
去坠机地点，看看留下什么线索
Go back to the crash site, see what they left behind.

729
00:56:16,824 --> 00:56:18,025
收到
Roger, that.

730
00:56:31,912 --> 00:56:33,246
谢了，婆婆
Thanks ma'am.

731
00:56:55,154 --> 00:56:59,033
头儿，我想你最好过来看下
Hey boss, I think you better come look at this.

732
00:57:00,817 --> 00:57:02,517
这是我们截获的
This is a record of what we picked up

733
00:57:02,518 --> 00:57:05,478
卡莱尔和逃犯之间的传输记录
being transferred between Carlyle and the criminals.

734
00:57:05,974 --> 00:57:08,361
难怪她如此想要追回来
That's why she wants it so badly.

735
00:57:08,706 --> 00:57:11,819
他脑子里有开启极乐世界的钥匙
He's got the keys to the kingdom in his fucking head!

736
00:57:12,817 --> 00:57:14,755
现在，我们只需要找到他
Now we just need to find it.

737
00:57:16,929 --> 00:57:18,820
释放飞碟
Gonna let the girls out.

738
00:57:28,421 --> 00:57:30,932
搜寻3到11路
13 grid, 3 to 11.

739
00:57:31,822 --> 00:57:34,721
我下令封锁全区
I'm authorising a Full Containment Order.

740
00:57:34,723 --> 00:57:37,623
洛杉矶禁飞
Issue a No Fly Zone for Los Angeles.

741
00:57:37,624 --> 00:57:38,903
全洛杉矶？
All of Los Angeles?

742
00:57:38,903 --> 00:57:40,823
罪犯正在逃亡
The murderer's still out there.

743
00:57:40,825 --> 00:57:42,314
直到找到他
Until we apprehend him,

744
00:57:42,314 --> 00:57:44,736
否则全洛杉矶不能有任何人离开
No one leaves the surface of that city.

745
00:57:52,236 --> 00:57:53,890
搞什么…？
What the f...?

746
00:57:58,463 --> 00:57:59,947
麦克斯
Max.

747
00:58:42,397 --> 00:58:45,145
宝贝！
Hey, sweety!

748
00:58:45,169 --> 00:58:46,754
我们能回家了
We can go home.

749
00:58:47,535 --> 00:58:50,065
我好点了吗？
Am I better?

750
00:58:51,582 --> 00:58:54,508
我去开车，好吗？
I'm gonna get the car, okay?

751
00:58:57,418 --> 00:58:59,017
马上回来
Be right back.

752
00:59:04,255 --> 00:59:06,409
弗蕾…
Frey...

753
00:59:07,901 --> 00:59:10,139
麦克斯
Max!

754
00:59:12,142 --> 00:59:14,622
我的天哪，你怎么了？
My God, what happened to you?

755
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:20,497
- 该死，我去叫医生  - 不，不！
- Shit, gonna get the medics. - No, no!

756
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:22,793
- 我不能进去  - 麦克斯！
- I can't go in there. - Max!

757
00:59:22,796 --> 00:59:23,537
我进不去…
I can't go in...

758
00:59:23,537 --> 00:59:24,982
麦克斯，听着，你需要看医生
Max, listen, you need a doctor, OK?

759
00:59:24,983 --> 00:59:27,555
他们再找我 他们要杀了我
People are looking for me. They're gonna kill me.

760
00:59:27,673 --> 00:59:29,542
- 我到这来找你 你得帮我  - 麦克斯！
- I came here for you. I need your help. - Max!

761
00:59:29,543 --> 00:59:32,265
你必须去医院接受治疗
You've got to go through the system to get treatment.

762
00:59:32,399 --> 00:59:36,077
拜托你帮我，我还不想死
Please help me. I don't wanna die.

763
00:59:38,544 --> 00:59:39,559
麦克斯！
Max!

764
00:59:40,144 --> 00:59:41,159
麦克斯！
Max!

765
00:59:43,346 --> 00:59:45,031
醒醒！
Stay awake!

766
00:59:54,450 --> 00:59:56,340
我想看看那个人
I wanna see the man.

767
00:59:56,341 --> 00:59:58,643
妈妈去帮他，好吗？
Mama's gonna help him, OK?

768
00:59:58,717 --> 01:00:00,063
你先睡吧
Try to sleep.

769
01:00:04,359 --> 01:00:06,403
别睡着！
Don't sleep!

770
01:00:06,449 --> 01:00:08,487
你可真够重的
You're too heavy for me.

771
01:00:08,487 --> 01:00:09,547
麦克斯，帮帮我！
Max, help me!

772
01:00:10,449 --> 01:00:11,891
加油！
Come on!

773
01:00:11,911 --> 01:00:14,534
麦克斯，你行的，加油！
Max, you can do it, come on!

774
01:00:16,957 --> 01:00:19,855
等会，我先把你转过来！
No, wait. Let's turn you over!

775
01:01:06,136 --> 01:01:09,170
麦克斯，等下
Max, Max, wait.

776
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:15,567
- 谢谢  - 谁把你弄成这样？
- Thank you. - Who did this to you?

777
01:01:15,593 --> 01:01:18,149
好吧，我在工作时受到了感染
Okay. I got hurt at at work.

778
01:01:18,150 --> 01:01:20,700
我只有接受斯派德的工作
I had to take a job from Spider

779
01:01:20,722 --> 01:01:23,777
设法上极乐空间去得到治疗
to try to get up there and get healed.

780
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:27,291
结果失败了，现在我有麻烦了
It went bad, now I'm in trouble.

781
01:01:27,293 --> 01:01:28,880
妈妈？
Mommy?

782
01:01:30,849 --> 01:01:33,952
宝贝，到这来！
Hey, sweety, come here!

783
01:01:37,564 --> 01:01:39,475
找个人是谁？
Who is that man?

784
01:01:40,764 --> 01:01:42,074
他叫麦克斯
His name is Max.

785
01:01:42,074 --> 01:01:44,851
我和你这么大的时候认识他的
Mommy knew him when he was your age.

786
01:01:45,665 --> 01:01:48,767
这是玛蒂尔达
It's Matilda.

787
01:01:49,266 --> 01:01:51,366
你去看动画片吧
You can go watch cartoons, OK?

788
01:01:52,066 --> 01:01:53,665
我一会就过去
I'll be right there.

789
01:01:56,020 --> 01:01:57,692
我并不知道你已经有…
I didn't know you had...

790
01:01:59,169 --> 01:02:00,627
我很抱歉，我得走了
I'm so sorry, I need to go.

791
01:02:00,755 --> 01:02:02,167
等下，麦克斯，你不能离开这
Wait, Max, you can not leave.

792
01:02:02,167 --> 01:02:04,199
我不该来这，我得走了！
I shouldn't have come here. I have to leave!

793
01:02:04,268 --> 01:02:05,648
麦克斯！她快死了
Max! She's dying.

794
01:02:05,648 --> 01:02:08,562
白血病晚期
She's in the final stages of leukemia.

795
01:02:09,512 --> 01:02:11,805
我说过我的人生很坎坷
I told you my life complicated.

796
01:02:11,805 --> 01:02:13,383
我需要你的帮助
I need you to help me.

797
01:02:13,570 --> 01:02:15,688
我不知道怎么办？
I've no idea how to do this.

798
01:02:15,688 --> 01:02:16,851
干什么？
How to do what?

799
01:02:16,870 --> 01:02:18,447
带他去极乐世界
Get her to Elysium.

800
01:02:18,448 --> 01:02:20,170
我不能帮他 我…
I can't help her. I...

801
01:02:21,171 --> 01:02:22,796
如果我能我当然会.
I would if I could.

802
01:02:23,216 --> 01:02:25,311
这个呢？假的身份
How about this? Fake citizenship.

803
01:02:25,311 --> 01:02:26,668
如果你带她去那里
If you took her there,

804
01:02:26,829 --> 01:02:28,496
你能带她去那吗？
could you heal her with this?

805
01:02:28,496 --> 01:02:29,904
这不可能
It doesn't work that way.

806
01:02:30,032 --> 01:02:33,365
这个代码是和我的DNA锁在一块的
This is coded to me, it's locked to my DNA.

807
01:02:33,373 --> 01:02:35,212
那些人正在找我 他们…
The people looking for me. They...

808
01:02:35,212 --> 01:02:37,420
你不了解他们是什么样的人
You don't understand who these people are.

809
01:02:37,774 --> 01:02:40,403
如果他们在这找到我，他们会杀光我们
If they find me here, they will kill all of us.

810
01:02:40,406 --> 01:02:42,962
我唯一能帮你的就是离开这里
The only thing I can do to help you is leave.

811
01:02:42,962 --> 01:02:43,740
我保证
I promise you.

812
01:02:44,175 --> 01:02:45,490
她是我的全部
She's all I have.

813
01:02:45,987 --> 01:02:47,075
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

814
01:02:53,008 --> 01:02:55,551
你身上绑着绷带
You have bandages.

815
01:02:57,377 --> 01:02:59,284
是，我绑着绷带
Yeah. I got bandages.

816
01:03:02,878 --> 01:03:04,563
你在干嘛？
What are you doing?

817
01:03:04,778 --> 01:03:07,143
我不想你生病
I don't want you to be sick.

818
01:03:07,143 --> 01:03:09,019
你想听故事吗？
You wanna hear a story?

819
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:15,040
从前，有一只狸住在森林里面
There once was a meerkat who lived in the jungle.

820
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:18,026
它很饿，而且它很小
He was hungry and he was small.

821
01:03:18,281 --> 01:03:19,910
非常的小
So small.

822
01:03:19,981 --> 01:03:23,075
其他大的动物都有食物
And the other big animals had all the food,

823
01:03:23,323 --> 01:03:25,982
因为他们可以够到水果
'cause they could reach the fruits.

824
01:03:25,990 --> 01:03:29,282
所以它和一个河马当了朋友
So he made friends with a hippopotamus

825
01:03:29,284 --> 01:03:31,063
好了，别说了
OK, stop!

826
01:03:32,583 --> 01:03:34,856
关于狸的故事还没好的下场
It doesn't end well for the meerkat.

827
01:03:35,584 --> 01:03:40,984
对，它站在河马的背上
Yes, it does 'cause he can stand on the hippopotamus' back

828
01:03:40,986 --> 01:03:44,285
可以吃到它想吃的所有水果
to get all the fruits that he wants.

829
01:03:44,385 --> 01:03:46,040
它给河马什么好处？
What's in it for the hippo?

830
01:03:46,278 --> 01:03:49,203
这个河马想要一个朋友
The hippo wants a friend.

831
01:04:05,372 --> 01:04:07,465
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

832
01:04:45,596 --> 01:04:47,596
头儿
Hey, boss.

833
01:04:49,441 --> 01:04:51,596
我想我找到他了
I think we got him.

834
01:04:56,998 --> 01:04:59,362
降落飞船
Yank this fucking boat!

835
01:05:23,502 --> 01:05:25,542
妈妈，一切都好吗？
Mommy, is everything OK?

836
01:05:25,542 --> 01:05:26,902
是的，宝贝
It's OK, sweety.

837
01:05:36,604 --> 01:05:38,404
安全
Clear!

838
01:05:40,805 --> 01:05:42,705
这是什么？
What is this?

839
01:05:42,905 --> 01:05:44,505
下午好
Good afternoon.

840
01:05:45,106 --> 01:05:48,806
很抱歉闯进你家 不是有意…
Sorry to come bursting into your home. Didn't mean to...

841
01:05:48,807 --> 01:05:51,006
吓着你女儿
traumatize your young daughter.

842
01:05:52,226 --> 01:05:55,907
我们正在找一个年轻的家伙…
Me and the boys here are looking for a young gentleman...

843
01:05:55,909 --> 01:05:58,724
他之前还在这
who was in this very house a moment ago.

844
01:05:58,808 --> 01:06:01,708
我希望你能告诉我他去哪了
We're hoping you can tell us where he went.

845
01:06:01,768 --> 01:06:03,496
不
No.

846
01:06:04,109 --> 01:06:05,608
我…
I...

847
01:06:07,509 --> 01:06:09,814
我不知道他去哪了
I don't know where he is.

848
01:06:09,815 --> 01:06:11,710
我不想…
I don't believe in...

849
01:06:11,711 --> 01:06:14,504
在小孩面前用暴力
committing violent acts in front of the kids.

850
01:06:14,811 --> 01:06:17,191
所以我需要你闭上你的眼睛
So I just need you to close your eyes, sweetheart.

851
01:06:17,192 --> 01:06:17,899
没事
It's OK.

852
01:06:19,582 --> 01:06:22,315
我真需要你告诉我
I really need you to tell me.

853
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:26,112
- 想起来了吗？ - 妈妈！
- You remember now? - Mommy!

854
01:06:26,114 --> 01:06:28,386
闭上眼睛，捂住她的眼
Close your eyes, keep your fucking eyes closed.

855
01:06:28,386 --> 01:06:29,381
让她闭上眼
Keep her eyes closed.

856
01:06:29,513 --> 01:06:31,224
求你了，我真不知道他去哪了
Please, I don't know where he is.

857
01:06:31,226 --> 01:06:34,514
他受伤了，我帮他治疗，之后就离开了
He was wounded, I helped him and he left.

858
01:06:35,315 --> 01:06:36,412
拜托
Please!

859
01:06:36,413 --> 01:06:38,133
你听到了吗？
D'you fucking hear that?

860
01:06:38,133 --> 01:06:39,854
现在已经没有忠诚了吗？
No loyalty nowadays, hey?

861
01:06:43,965 --> 01:06:46,216
这是什么？
What's this here?

862
01:06:46,316 --> 01:06:49,110
这是你的医院？
This a hospital you're running here?

863
01:06:49,111 --> 01:06:50,067
她病了
She's sick.

864
01:06:50,068 --> 01:06:51,075
她病了？
She's sick?

865
01:06:51,075 --> 01:06:54,181
让我看看她…
Let me have a look at her...

866
01:06:54,217 --> 01:06:55,582
别碰她
Don't touch her.

867
01:06:55,583 --> 01:06:58,313
看见了吗？母亲的本能保护！
See that? Protective instinct, here!

868
01:06:58,338 --> 01:06:59,500
我说过了，别碰她！
I said don't touch her!

869
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:01,690
我看看能不能在你孩子口里套出话
I'm just trying to have a word with your child.

870
01:07:01,775 --> 01:07:02,716
别碰她！
Do not touch her!

871
01:07:02,842 --> 01:07:04,024
带她走
Bring her. Come!

872
01:07:04,024 --> 01:07:05,705
你要带她去哪？
Where are you taking her?

873
01:07:05,931 --> 01:07:07,266
宝贝，没事的
Sweety, it's OK.

874
01:07:07,601 --> 01:07:09,794
没事，没事的
It's OK, darling. It's OK.

875
01:07:09,795 --> 01:07:11,782
坐下！闭嘴！
Sit! Shut up!

876
01:07:25,996 --> 01:07:27,532
停下！
Stop!

877
01:07:30,591 --> 01:07:31,931
别，别，别开枪！
No, no, don't shoot him!

878
01:07:32,686 --> 01:07:35,286
把枪放下！让他进来！
Put the gun down! Let him come!

879
01:07:36,038 --> 01:07:38,528
你下载了一下数据，知道吗？
You got something, didn't you?

880
01:07:38,529 --> 01:07:39,058
什么？
What?

881
01:07:39,184 --> 01:07:41,572
这就是他们禁飞的原因…
That's why they shut down the sky...

882
01:07:41,572 --> 01:07:42,283
是什么？
what is it?

883
01:07:42,285 --> 01:07:43,501
转账资料？公司机密？
Wire transfers? Corporate intel?

884
01:07:43,501 --> 01:07:44,903
你肯定搞到了重要资料！
You gotta have something big in there!

885
01:07:44,963 --> 01:07:46,932
不 我们弄不到任何东西！
No. I fucking got nothing, man!

886
01:07:46,986 --> 01:07:49,350
全是扰频 胡里奥死了
It all got scrambled. Julio is dead.

887
01:07:49,350 --> 01:07:51,460
你欠我的 现在让我马上走！
You owe me. Let's go fucking now!

888
01:07:51,545 --> 01:07:55,049
不行！飞行系统被他们锁定了！
We can't! The flight system is jammed!

889
01:07:55,133 --> 01:07:57,286
没人能离开这
Nobody is going up there.

890
01:08:00,330 --> 01:08:02,483
- 到什么时候？  - 我不知道
- Until when? - Till I don't fucking know.

891
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:05,093
我得离开这！
I gotta fucking get up there!

892
01:08:05,093 --> 01:08:06,922
所有人都想离开这
Everyone needs to get up there.

893
01:08:07,051 --> 01:08:08,032
我的人已经再想办法了
My guys are working on it.

894
01:08:08,075 --> 01:08:12,581
我认为可能再也连不上线了
See if they have a hope in hell of ever getting back online.

895
01:08:12,781 --> 01:08:15,131
但现在…
But, for now...

896
01:08:15,608 --> 01:08:18,423
看看你脑袋里面到底是什么
Let's just take a look at that head of yours.

897
01:08:18,424 --> 01:08:19,832
离我远点！
Get away from me, man!

898
01:08:19,833 --> 01:08:20,497
看着我
Look at me,

899
01:08:21,623 --> 01:08:24,756
他们关闭了整个天空
if they shut down the whole fucking sky,

900
01:08:24,834 --> 01:08:27,757
就因为有什么在你脑袋里…
for what's in your head...

901
01:08:27,877 --> 01:08:30,203
或许打开它的钥匙
Maybe the key to opening it

902
01:08:30,227 --> 01:08:32,662
就在里面，对吧？
could be in there too, right?

903
01:08:34,457 --> 01:08:35,595
过来
Come on.

904
01:08:40,072 --> 01:08:41,413
好
Alright

905
01:08:50,537 --> 01:08:54,992
为了这个他们会追杀你到天涯海角的
They will hunt you to the edge of the world for this.

906
01:08:54,994 --> 01:08:56,248
这是什么？
What is it?

907
01:08:56,673 --> 01:08:59,210
这是极乐世界的重启系统
It is a reboot program for Elysium.

908
01:08:59,308 --> 01:09:00,081
谁拥有了它
Whoever has this,

909
01:09:00,081 --> 01:09:03,888
就相当于有权利控制整个系统
has the power to override their whole system.

910
01:09:04,890 --> 01:09:06,890
开放边界…
Open the borders...

911
01:09:06,983 --> 01:09:12,040
所有人将成为极乐世界的公民
Make everyone a citizen of Elysium.

912
01:09:12,871 --> 01:09:17,441
这也能救你的命
This can save your life.

913
01:09:18,542 --> 01:09:21,002
我们能够拯救所有人
We can save everyone.

914
01:09:21,002 --> 01:09:22,642
我什么时候去？
When can I go?

915
01:09:22,644 --> 01:09:25,443
他们正在尝试黑进去关闭信号阻挡，应该不久…
They're trying to hack through the signal jam, but soon...

916
01:09:25,444 --> 01:09:28,058
别说没用的，我们什么时候能走？
Don't bullshit me, when can we go?

917
01:09:28,058 --> 01:09:28,765
我不知道
I dunno.

918
01:09:28,767 --> 01:09:29,844
五天… 一周？
Five days... a week?

919
01:09:29,845 --> 01:09:32,211
去你的，我没有5天了！
Fuck you, I don't have 5 days!

920
01:09:32,211 --> 01:09:33,128
我没有时间了
I got hours.

921
01:09:33,129 --> 01:09:34,762
我的人正在努力进去
My guys are working on it.

922
01:09:34,764 --> 01:09:36,335
你总这么说
You're always working on it,

923
01:09:36,335 --> 01:09:37,745
你不让我上去
You can't get me up there.

924
01:09:37,746 --> 01:09:39,945
我不懂你为什么把人们弄上去
I don't know why you try sending people up there,

925
01:09:39,946 --> 01:09:41,544
他们去了就是去送死
they just get fucking shot down.

926
01:09:41,546 --> 01:09:42,893
有你脑袋里的东西就不会了！
Not with what's in your head!

927
01:09:42,893 --> 01:09:44,240
这就是我要说的！
That's what I'm talking about!

928
01:09:44,241 --> 01:09:46,118
我们将会控制这个系统
We would control the system.

929
01:09:46,118 --> 01:09:47,542
我们将说了算！
We would be in charge!

930
01:09:47,544 --> 01:09:50,447
我们甚至能改变这该死的历史！
We can change the course of fucking history!

931
01:09:50,448 --> 01:09:51,447
回到刚才说的…
Back up there...

932
01:09:51,448 --> 01:09:53,240
我脑袋里面的东西
What I have in my head,

933
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:55,480
对他们很重要，对吧？
is worth a lot to them, right?

934
01:09:57,392 --> 01:09:58,330
不要这么做
Don't do this.

935
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:00,701
如果这落到他们的手里
If it falls into the wrong hands,

936
01:10:00,701 --> 01:10:02,863
他们永远不会让我们进去的
they could shut us out for good.

937
01:10:02,986 --> 01:10:05,932
听我说，我现在就上去
Listen, man, I'm going up there right now.

938
01:10:06,050 --> 01:10:08,601
如果你找到我，而且我被治好了
If you can find me, and I'm healed,

939
01:10:08,601 --> 01:10:10,374
我把一切给你
you can have all of this.

940
01:10:10,484 --> 01:10:12,147
但我现在不想死
But I'm not fucking dying.

941
01:10:12,147 --> 01:10:14,212
这不对，麦克斯，别这么做
This is wrong, Max, don't do this.

942
01:10:24,964 --> 01:10:27,455
别开枪！
Do not shoot him! Do not shoot him!

943
01:10:27,581 --> 01:10:28,997
让他走！
Let go!

944
01:10:34,855 --> 01:10:37,772
没事，没事
It's okay. It's okay.

945
01:10:40,707 --> 01:10:42,977
我一直想要个老婆
I always wanted a wife.

946
01:10:46,857 --> 01:10:48,758
只是不能安定下来，你知道吗？
Just couldn't quite settle down, you know?

947
01:10:49,408 --> 01:10:52,236
诱惑太多了
Too much temptation.

948
01:10:55,258 --> 01:10:57,426
但你…
But you...

949
01:11:02,259 --> 01:11:04,273
你让我想安家了
You make me ready to settle down.

950
01:11:04,275 --> 01:11:07,574
你真的让我想安家了，宝贝
You really make me want to settle down, baby.

951
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:21,734
- 见鬼了，头 - 呃？
- Holy shit, sir. - Eh?

952
01:11:21,803 --> 01:11:23,100
你最好过来看看
You better come take a look at this.

953
01:11:23,167 --> 01:11:26,199
- 怎么了？  - 看看这个家伙
- What is it? - Check this fucking guy.

954
01:11:29,772 --> 01:11:31,371
转头回去
Turn us around.

955
01:11:56,369 --> 01:11:57,568
- 拿着它  - 好的，头
- Take it. - Right, sir.

956
01:11:57,869 --> 01:11:59,499
开开门
Open the door.

957
01:12:11,871 --> 01:12:12,993
站在那
Stop right there,

958
01:12:12,993 --> 01:12:15,425
你在照我说说的做
and you're gonna do exactly what I say.

959
01:12:15,672 --> 01:12:19,191
或者我将炸开我的头，明白了吗？
Or I'm gonna blow my fucking head off, understand?

960
01:12:19,673 --> 01:12:20,790
好！
Yeah!

961
01:12:21,573 --> 01:12:24,045
你能得到我脑袋里的一切东西！
You can have everything in my head!

962
01:12:24,073 --> 01:12:25,717
只要你带我上去
Just take me up there,

963
01:12:25,717 --> 01:12:27,433
并让我进医疗舱
and get me in a med-bay.

964
01:12:27,444 --> 01:12:29,342
我的东西很有价值
What I have is very valuable.

965
01:12:30,079 --> 01:12:31,726
我们能治好你
We can fix you up.

966
01:12:32,275 --> 01:12:35,732
把你放进医疗舱，这些问题都好解决
Put you in a med-bay, Sort all this fuck-up.

967
01:12:35,875 --> 01:12:39,277
走吧！我们带你上去
Let's go! We'll take you up there.

968
01:12:39,547 --> 01:12:41,852
晴朗的天气，清新的空气
Weather's nice, air's nice and clean.

969
01:12:42,849 --> 01:12:44,675
你将会喜欢那的
Likely you'll dig it.

970
01:12:46,109 --> 01:12:48,210
别想其他的事！
Don't you fucking try anything!

971
01:12:48,210 --> 01:12:49,076
上船吧！
Step aboard!

972
01:12:49,455 --> 01:12:52,295
进来看看我们的兄弟，来吧
Come meet the boys, come on!

973
01:12:53,057 --> 01:12:54,659
别害羞，他们吃不了你
Don't be shy, they won't bite.

974
01:12:54,910 --> 01:12:56,454
我给你介绍
Let me introduce you.

975
01:12:56,454 --> 01:12:58,421
这是德雷克 这是麦克斯
This is Drakie. This is Max.

976
01:12:58,573 --> 01:12:59,719
怎么样？
What is news?

977
01:13:11,281 --> 01:13:12,584
走吧！
Let's fly!

978
01:13:14,582 --> 01:13:18,400
是的，夫人.我们已经抓到罪犯
Yes, ma'am, we apprehended the subject.

979
01:13:19,226 --> 01:13:21,754
打开领空，我们要进去
Open the skies, we're coming in.

980
01:13:21,754 --> 01:13:24,066
我们十九分钟后见
I'll expect you in 19 minutes.

981
01:13:37,272 --> 01:13:39,458
取消禁飞
Cancel the No Fly Zone.

982
01:13:39,458 --> 01:13:40,551
是的，夫人
Yes, ma'am.

983
01:13:43,273 --> 01:13:44,552
连上…
Hold it...

984
01:13:45,073 --> 01:13:46,155
连上了 怎么了？
Hold it. What is that?

985
01:13:46,615 --> 01:13:48,018
网络连上了？马塞洛！
Are we back? Marcelo!

986
01:13:48,018 --> 01:13:50,252
怎么回事？恢复了？
What the fuck is that? Are we back?

987
01:13:50,378 --> 01:13:52,168
- 我们都连上了  - 好

我们该不该弄掉这些东西？

不行，得到我们得到数据

接近警告
一不明飞行器正在靠近

1058
01:20:59,525 --> 01:21:01,601

1063
01:21:12,069 --> 01:21:13,135
准备好了吗？
Are you ready?

1064
01:21:14,063 --> 01:21:16,256
你们想在他那取出什么？
What are you taking out of him?

1065
01:21:16,385 --> 01:21:19,326
你们对他做了什么？

1066

吃了个手雷

His brain is fine.

1074
01:22:04,656 --> 01:22:07,272
（已检测到颌面撕裂伤）

But he's gonna be pissed when he wakes up.

1075
01:22:07,373 --> 01:22:11,072
记得在印度，他丢掉了条胳膊吗？
Remember what cock-up happened in India when he lost his hat?

1076
01:22:16,965 --> 01:22:18,433

1077
01:22:34,776 --> 01:22:36,380
克鲁格

好了，一切就绪

1082
01:22:52,327 --> 01:22:53,979
我们可以获取数据了
Let's get the data.

1083
01:22:54,589 --> 01:22:56,561
准备注射
I got the needle prepped.

1084
01:22:56,561 --> 01:22:58,079
你抓住这个
You wanna grab this?

1085
01:22:59,090 --> 01:23:00,680
抓住针头！抓住…

你们把她们带去哪了？

1087
01:23:22,979 --> 01:23:23,735
在储备库

1088
01:23:23,736 --> 01:23:25,085

1091
01:23:37,608 --> 01:23:40,274
你需要立即接受治疗

1092
01:23:48,112 --> 01:23:48,900
你个蠢货！
You idiot!

1093
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:51,195
你知道你在干嘛吗？
Do you realize what you've done?

1094
01:23:51,683 --> 01:23:56,365
你在郊区坠毁了一艘无证飞船
You crashed an unlicensed vehicle into a suburban area.

1095
01:23:58,015 --> 01:24:01,458
你的命令是机密行动
Your orders were to keep this covert.

1096
01:24:01,460 --> 01:24:04,691
你知道这是什么意思吗？

1097
01:24:07,304 --> 01:24:09,326
你是不是完全疯了？
Have you completely lost your mind?

1098
01:24:10,028 --> 01:24:11,617
你已经没用了
You're useless to me.

1099
01:24:11,693 --> 01:24:14,764
如果政府意识到我们在做什么
If the administration realized what we're doing.

1100
01:24:14,766 --> 01:24:17,084
他们会把我们以叛国罪杀死
They'd hang us both for treason.

1101
01:24:19,465 --> 01:24:20,985
天哪，克鲁格！
For God's sake, Kruger!

1102
01:24:20,985 --> 01:24:22,506
听见了吗？

破坏了别人的草坪
and ruined someone's lawn.

1108
01:24:38,079 --> 01:24:41,056
没人能以叛国罪杀死我们
But nobody is gonna hang us for treason.

1109
01:24:41,738 --> 01:24:43,621
我们现在说了算！
We do the hanging!

1110
01:24:45,599 --> 01:24:48,091
把手放在上面，按住
Put your hand on it. keep pressure on it.

1111
01:24:49,300 --> 01:24:51,700
不能说话了吗？
How tough you be now, eh?

1112
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:56,237
好了，伙计们极乐世界总算可以有个称职的总统了
Right boys, Elysium is about to get its first proper president.

1113
01:25:00,702 --> 01:25:02,992
她需要一些治疗
She needs some medical attention.

1114
01:25:09,203 --> 01:25:11,473
我本来想治好你女儿的
I was gonna heal your daughter.

1115
01:25:11,599 --> 01:25:15,102
但现在，她永远不可能被治好了
But now, I'll make sure she's never healed.

1116
01:25:15,804 --> 01:25:19,104
德雷克，不要相信任何政客说的话
Drakie, don't trust any of those politicians!

1117
01:25:19,106 --> 01:25:20,804
清空这栋楼
Clear out this whole building!

1118
01:25:20,805 --> 01:25:22,555
好的，头
Thank you, boss.

1119
01:25:22,705 --> 01:25:25,115
我去找那个小混混
I'm gonna find that little gangster.

1120
01:25:25,117 --> 01:25:27,282
我将去下他的脑袋
I'm gonna take what's in his head.

1121
01:25:27,282 --> 01:25:28,706
现在这是我的了
This place is mine now.

1122
01:25:28,707 --> 01:25:31,368
你想来我家和我玩？
You want to come to my fucking house and play?

1123
01:25:31,370 --> 01:25:32,607
来玩吧
Then play!

1124
01:25:32,608 --> 01:25:35,870
我去干掉那个家伙
I'm going to annihilate that little motherfucker

1125
01:25:35,874 --> 01:25:37,871
把他碾成粉末…
Pulverize that damn...

1126
01:25:52,485 --> 01:25:53,838
发什么什么情况？
What the hell was that?

1127
01:25:55,711 --> 01:26:00,441
所有CCB成员请在最近的出口撤离
All members of CCB please go to the nearest exit

I can not arrest a citizen of Elysium.

1273
01:40:27,419 --> 01:40:28,949
什么？
What?

1274
01:40:29,334 --> 01:40:31,078
干的好
Doing a great job.

1275
01:40:31,859 --> 01:40:34,709
猜猜极乐空间现在属于谁了？
Guess who Elysium belongs to now?

1276
01:40:35,152 --> 01:40:38,044
新的公民需要医疗

1277
01:40:38,044 --> 01:40:40,027
计算中…

1278
01:40:40,027 --> 01:40:42,691
派遣医疗机去地球进行援救医疗

1279
01:41:29,743 --> 01:41:31,981
从我们这看过去那里很美不是吗？

1280
01:41:33,119 --> 01:41:36,497
从我这看过去那里也很美

1281
01:41:36,671 --> 01:41:38,770
现在它属于你了

1282
01:41:39,117 --> 01:41:42,771
你永远不要忘记你来自哪里

1283
01:41:54,773 --> 01:41:57,019
我的小麦克斯
