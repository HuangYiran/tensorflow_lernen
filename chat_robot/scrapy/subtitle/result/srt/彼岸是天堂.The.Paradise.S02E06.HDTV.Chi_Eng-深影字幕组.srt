00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,530
彼岸是天堂 第二季 第六集

2
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,530
艾德蒙・洛维特

3
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:42,530
在干什么 叔叔?
What are you doing, Uncle?

4
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,410
用你自己的名字当店名 不是个简单的事
To have your name above a shop, it's no small thing.

5
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,020
你才发现么?
Have you only just noticed?

6
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,850
你忘了 是么?
You've forgotten, haven't you?

7
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,770
明显 我知道或者应该知道你在说什么
Clearly I have or I'd know what you're talking about.

8
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,450
五年了
Five years.

9
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,210
到这周
This week.

10
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,970
那块招牌挂上去有五年了
Five years since that sign went up,

11
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:07,180
天堂百货取代了艾默森服装店
this place stopped being Emmerson's Drapery and became The Paradise.

12
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,340
芙罗拉?
Flora?

13
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,730
你在哪 亲爱的?
Where are you, darling?

14
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:35,580
芙罗拉?
Flora?

15
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,380
芙罗拉?
Flora?

16
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,420
- 芙罗拉? - 嘘
- Flora? - Ssh.

17
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,100
芙罗拉?
Flora?

18
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,140
约翰?
John?

19
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,140
被你发现了
You caught me.

20
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,570
对不起 亲爱的 我没能忍住
I'm sorry, sweetheart. I couldn't resist.

21
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,330
我总是在想坐在这里是什么感觉
I've always wondered what it would feel like to sit there.

22
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:40,300
也许我该当心自己的位子啦
Perhaps I ought to be careful where I leave my trousers lying.

23
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,890
我们玩个游戏
It's a game.

24
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,577
不管凯瑟琳说什么 我们都别和她说话 
Whatever Katherine says, we don't speak to her. 

25
00:03:04,578 --> 00:03:06,050
老天啊! 搞什么鬼
Heavens! What a trick.

26
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,330
我差不多找了你一整天了
I might have been searching for you the whole day.

27
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,850
我都急疯了
It has quite jangled my nerves.

28
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,690
汤姆 亲爱的 听到了么?
Tom, darling, did you hear me?

29
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,370
芙罗拉...
Flora...

30
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,700
- 我们去树迷宫里玩好吗? - 好的爸爸
- Shall we go and play in the maze? - Yes, Papa.

31
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,300
汤姆
Tom.

32
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,740
芙罗拉
Flora.

33
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,570
我在和你说话
I'm talking to you.

34
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,650
芙罗拉宝贝 你追我还是我追你?
Flora, sweetheart, will you chase me or shall I chase you?

35
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,180
你来追我 爸爸
You chase after me, Papa.

36
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,220
你们今天当我不存在么?
Do I not exist today?

37
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,020
你们倒是说句话啊!
I demand that you speak to me!

38
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,610
汤姆 你已经这样好几天了
Tom, you have been like this for days.

39
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,860
像鬼一样盯着我 又一句话也不说
Like a ghost staring at me but, but saying nothing.

40
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,180
到底怎么了?
What is the matter?

41
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,820
女士
Ma'am.

42
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,087
- 早上好 - 先生 
- Good morning. - Sir. 

43
00:04:17,088 --> 00:04:18,980
我们当然得好好庆祝这个日子
 Of course we must mark the occasion.

44
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:23,410
橱窗展览 布满彩旗
Window displays, flags and bunting throughout the place.

45
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,330
装饰一新
All manner of decorations.

46
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,890
要不 在天花板上悬挂天堂鸟
I thought, perhaps, birds of paradise hung from the ceiling.

47
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,130
达德利 我很欣赏你的干劲十足
I appreciate the sentiment, Dudley,

48
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,168
但这是我们陶醉于做这些琐事的时候么? 
but are these times for us to revel in our position? 

49
00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:34,250
先生 早上好
Sir. Morning.

50
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,510
每个可人的小玩意
Every bright bauble 

51
00:04:35,511 --> 00:04:38,010
都将是汤姆・威斯顿的眼中钉肉中刺
will be a poke in the eye of Tom Weston.

52
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,970
一想到他会看到我们的成就 我就开心
I like the thought of him seeing what we have achieved here.

53
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,690
也对
Yes.

54
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,490
- 那就做吧 - 莫里先生 
- Then let's do it. - Mr Moray

55
00:04:44,491 --> 00:04:45,130
早上好
- Morning.

56
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,730
早上好
Good morning.

57
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,540
简直跟泡在了蜜罐里似的 这感觉太美了!
I feel like I'm wrapped in butter, It's heavenly!

58
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,890
美吗?
Is it heavenly?

59
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,130
我是说 我穿起来很蠢么? 我该买么?
I mean, do I look foolish in it? Should I buy it?

60
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,410
这... 这很完美 夫人 我觉得
It... it's perfect, ma'am, I think.

61
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:01,250
或者... 你觉得如何 克莱拉?
Perhaps... What do you think, Clara?

62
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,967
夫人我向你保证 
Ma'am I promise you, 

63
00:05:02,968 --> 00:05:06,170
这条裙子 是最优雅时尚的选择
it is a most tasteful and fashionable choice.

64
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:10,290
我该什么时候穿? 有的裙子是晚...
When do I wear it? I know some dresses are for evening...

65
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,010
夫人 这件裙子任何时候都能穿
Ma'am, this dress can be worn at any time.

66
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:17,610
噢 这太好玩了 你们又这么热心地帮我
Oh, but this is such fun and you're so kind to help me.

67
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,770
穿这裙子要配什么鞋子好?
What shoes does a lass wear with this dress?

68
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,820
你喜欢什么款式 夫人?
What kind of shoes would you prefer, madam?

69
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,592
我想要你来帮我选 
I'd prefer you to choose. 

70
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:29,530
你之前给我选的这些 简直是...
Everything you've chosen so far, it's just...

71
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,810
完美
Perfect.

72
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,810
不如...
What about...

73
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,930
这款灰色纽扣中靴?
The grey button boots?

74
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,660
要来一双试试么?
Would you like to try a pair?

75
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:42,090
要是你能帮我包起来 我丈夫就会来付款
If you can have them wrapped up, my husband will come in to pay.

76
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,090
当然 巴伦坦夫人
Of course, Mrs Ballentine.

77
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,530
我亲爱的巴伦坦 他把我捧在手心里爱着
Darling Ballentine. He does love to spoil me.

78
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,970
这也不多 是么?
It's not too much, is it?

79
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:53,570
买这么多会不会很俗很不淑女呢?
It's not coarse and unladylike to buy so much?

80
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,460
才不会 夫人 我们会帮你打包好
Not at all, Madam. We will have it all ready for you.

81
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,170
我以前是个护士 
I was a nurse, you know,

82
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:03,530
我有的差不多就一双靴子 你看我现在
with hardly a pair of boots to my name. Look at me now.

83
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,690
不知是谁梦寐以求的呢?
Who would have dreamed?

84
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,930
我从没想过我能每天穿着这么精美的制服上班
I never dreamed I'd have such a fine uniform to wear every day

85
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,700
还和这么好的朋友们住在一起
and such fond friends to share a dorm with.

86
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,810
包裹谁来送呢?
Who will deliver the parcels?

87
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:19,530
- 会有送货员的 夫人 用送货车 - 噢
- Oh, the delivery lads deliver, ma'am, on their delivery wagon. - Oh.

88
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:22,460
我更希望是你来送 苏西
I was rather hoping it would be you, Susy.

89
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,890
或者你 克莱拉
Or you, Clara.

90
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,255
我就能把它们都试一遍 
then I could try them all on and 

91
00:06:27,256 --> 00:06:28,610
然后你就能告诉我...
you could tell me...

92
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,970
你还能看看我们家的枝形吊灯
And you could see our chandeliers

93
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,650
感觉一下地毯有多厚
and feel how thick the carpets are.

94
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,682
巴伦坦夫人 如果您能抽出一上午在家试衣 
If you would care for a morning fitting at home, 

95
00:06:35,683 --> 00:06:37,850
 我可以来安排
Mrs , I'm sure that could be arranged.

96
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,930
可以
Yes.

97
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:43,050
我喜欢试衣这个词 我们可以喝茶吃烤饼
I like the sound of a fitting. We could have tea and scones.

98
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,690
还是说 烤饼只能午后吃?
Or, perhaps scones are only eaten in the afternoon?

99
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:49,871
请原谅 夫人 我的意思是午后试衣 
Forgive me, ma'am. What I meant to say was an afternoon fitting. 

100
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,980
好的!
Yes!

101
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:04,876
艾德蒙叔叔 
Uncle Edmund, 

102
00:07:04,877 --> 00:07:06,817
这是我这周第三次在旅馆看到你了
this is the third time I've seen you at the inn this week.

103
00:07:06,818 --> 00:07:08,370
奥德丽难道不会想你吗?
 Won't Audrey be missing you?

104
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,530
别急 德妮丝
Don't fret, our Denise.

105
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,198
天知道 我已经让人捎去便条
Hell's teeth, I've sent her a note 

106
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:13,730
告诉她我在回家的路上了
telling her I'm on my way back home.

107
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,170
我决不会干涉别人的家事
Far be it for me to interfere in another man's marriage,

108
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,253
但你为什么不自己去送便条给她? 
but why didn't you just take her the note yourself? 

109
00:07:18,254 --> 00:07:19,254
对啊
Yes.

110
00:07:19,255 --> 00:07:20,050
那你这会儿就能在家了
Then you would have been there,

111
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:23,810
就用不着送便条去解释为什么你...不在家
you wouldn't have needed to send a note to say why you're... not there.

112
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:27,010
坐吧 苏西 让你的小脑袋瓜儿歇歇
Have a sit down, Susy. Rest your mind a while.

113
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,677
你得承认 洛维特先生 你没有理由留这儿
You must admit, Mr. Lovett, you don't have any cause to stay...

114
00:07:29,678 --> 00:07:30,690
我有
Yes, I do.

115
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,810
我不是干涉别人婚姻上的私事的人 但是
I'm not one to meddle in the affairs of a marital nature, but,

116
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,370
你的理由是什么 艾德蒙?
what are your reasons, Edmund?

117
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:40,890
我不能因为这小店看起来破烂不堪就卖了它
I can't sell the shop because it looks so worn down and decrepit.

118
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,730
要是我粉刷一下 你就瞧着吧
Now, if I paint it up, you'll see,

119
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:46,330
它会成为一个小小的购物胜地
it'll make it a more agreeable proposition for any buyer.

120
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,199
辛苦劳作个几天 一切都会天差地别
A few days sweat and toil will make all the difference.

121
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,450
你当刮目相看
 You'll see.

122
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,330
- 加油 艾德蒙! - 我会证明给你们看
- Come on, Edmund! - I'll prove to the lot of you,

123
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,770
我在这儿唯一的理由是我打算出发了!
I'm only here because I intend to leave!

124
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,940
啊呦 艾德蒙!
Ah, Edmund!

125
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,050
她做到了 不是吗?
She's done it, hasn't she?

126
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,370
巴伦坦夫人
Mrs Balentine.

127
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,210
她得到了我们大家梦寐以求的一切
She's got what we all hanker after.

128
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,970
她嫁的是多金的丈夫 过的是奢华的生活
She's bagged herself a wealthy husband, living the grand life.

129
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,610
我不想 我想要温柔体贴的丈夫
I don't. I want a kind husband.

130
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,722
苏西 再考虑一下 
Susy, think on. 

131
00:08:21,723 --> 00:08:24,050
如果他不富裕的话 温柔体贴有何意义呢?
If he's not well-off, what good is his kindness?

132
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,890
我们都说梦想得到爱情
We all say what we dream of is love,

133
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,371
但是 我们就承认吧 
but, let's admit it, 

134
00:08:28,372 --> 00:08:30,660
我们真想要的是财富与爱情兼具
what we really want is love and riches.

135
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:35,170
每一个踏过那扇门的光鲜亮丽的女人
Every fine-dressed woman who walks through that door,

136
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,130
就是我们艳羡的
we just long for what she has.

137
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,697
这就是我们来百货商店工作的原因
That's why we come to work in a department store.

138
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,970
你都不发言 德妮丝
You're quiet, Denise.

139
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:45,050
你怎么看巴伦坦夫人的好运?
What do you say about Mrs Ballentine's good fortune?

140
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,370
我不会嫉妒我们的顾客
I don't envy our customers.

141
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:51,010
我也不渴望到天堂百货来购物挥霍
I can't say I long to come to The Paradise to shop and to spend.

142
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,810
噢 我们走吧
Oh, here we go.

143
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,810
你渴望什么 德妮丝?
What do you want, Denise?

144
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,255
在我梦想中的世界 
I dream of a world 

145
00:08:57,256 --> 00:08:59,330
女人不需要嫁一个富有的丈夫
where a woman doesn't need a rich husband.

146
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,010
噢 是啊
Oh, yes.

147
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:04,290
我还期待有一天女人当选首相
And I'm looking forward to the day when a woman is Prime Minister,

148
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,210
女人成为布道坛上的牧师
and a woman is a priest in the pulpit

149
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,490
女人掌控天堂百货!
and a woman is in charge of The Paradise!

150
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,780
汤姆?
Tom?

151
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,980
汤姆?
Tom?

152
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,090
他建议送德妮丝去巴黎...
His proposal to send Denise to Paris...

153
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,770
我怀疑他这么做是为了和我作对
I have little doubt he did it to antagonise me.

154
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,850
他擅自从店里拿走了你父亲的表
He took your father's watch from the store

155
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,690
甚至没经过你的同意
without so much as a by-your-leave.

156
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,290
就好像他知道我们谈了什么
It was as if he knew what you and I had spoken about,

157
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,330
你父亲的意愿是...
your father's wishes for the watch...

158
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:57,780
..把这只表留给你的丈夫
..to be left to the man you married.

159
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,810
怎么了?
What is it?

160
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,930
你明天能来吗?
Will you come back tomorrow?

161
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,460
我们到时候再说
We can speak then.

162
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,060
当然
Of course.

163
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,820
求你了 告诉我
Please, tell me.

164
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,810
天哪 帮帮我
God, help me.

165
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,460
天哪 请帮帮我吧
God, please help me.

166
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:26,330
他竟然能这么残酷
He is capable of such cruelty.

167
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,260
我从来没想到!
I never imagined!

168
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:34,460
我们结婚结的太匆忙 我几乎不了解他
We married in such haste. I hardly knew him.

169
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,060
我一直怕惹到他 生活在恐惧中
I live in terror of upsetting him.

170
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,100
我不知道他会如何反应所以一直不敢说出来
I dare not speak for fear of how he will react.

171
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,380
我总感觉他恨我
There are times I think he hates me.

172
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,940
他一心想要惩罚我
He wishes only to punish me.

173
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,100
这种日子我一天也受不了了!
I cannot bear one more day!

174
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,620
谢谢
Oh, thank you.

175
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,820
谢谢你
Thank you.

176
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,660
你不能这么过下去 凯瑟琳
You cannot live like this, Katherine.

177
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,580
那我又能怎样?
What else can I do?

178
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:30,500
答应我 如果你需要人陪一定要来找我
Promise me you will come to me when you need someone.

179
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:52,130
是她 是巴伦坦夫人! 她和她丈夫一起来了
It's her. It's Mrs Ballentine! She's here with her husband.

180
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,530
他 他是 他不是...
And he's, well, he's, well he's not...

181
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,749
我想说的是 他不是... 
What I'm trying to say is, he's not...  

182
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,370
她们在这 亲爱的!
Here they are, my darling!

183
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,050
我的新朋友们
My new friends.

184
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:04,690
- 她们一直都很照顾我 - 谢谢 姑娘们
- They've been looking after me so sweetly. - Thank you, girls,

185
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,210
让我妻子成为这整个城市最幸福的女人
for making my wife the happiest woman in the whole city.

186
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,770
拿出来 巴伦坦
Well, show them, Ballentine.

187
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,913
让她们看看我们有多感激 
Show them how obliged we are. 

188
00:12:12,914 --> 00:12:13,980
哦 没错!
Oh, yes!

189
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:28,066
我带您去收银台吧  巴伦坦先生
Perhaps you might come with me to the Cashier desk, mr Ballentine,

190
00:12:28,067 --> 00:12:29,650
去那儿结账
 to settle your account?

191
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,850
我打赌它一定在最下面!
I'll wager it's down all those stairs!

192
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:35,668
我可是刚刚爬上来! 谢谢 亲爱的! 
And I've just climbed up them! Thank you, dear! 

193
00:12:35,669 --> 00:12:36,620
这边请
This way.

194
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,767
我想让你们给我给我示范下
I need you to show me 

195
00:12:42,768 --> 00:12:44,140
穿上我的新衣服应该如何走路
how to walk in my new dresses.

196
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:48,050
我知道你在想什么 你在想
I know what you're thinking. You're thinking,

197
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,370
"这个男人
"Here's a man who's

198
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,543
深爱着他的妻子
"so in love with his wife 

199
00:12:50,544 --> 00:12:53,370
所以他会放任她所有心血来潮的行动"
that he will indulge her every whim."

200
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,540
你们的业绩要大大地上升咯!
Oh, how your sales will soar!

201
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:00,410
莫里先生 我能为你介绍巴伦坦先生吗?
Mr Moray, sir, might I introduce you to Mr Ballentine?

202
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,730
坎贝尔・巴伦坦? 我们之前见过一面 先生
Campbell Ballentine? We met once before, sir.

203
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,938
我想是在赌马赛场上 
I believe it was at the race course. 

204
00:13:04,939 --> 00:13:06,770
哦 是的 没错!
Oh, yes, of course!

205
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:09,450
我那天运气可不怎么样!
I lost a fortune that day!

206
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:13,210
我很高兴能在我的... 在天堂百货见到您
Well, I am pleased to see you in my...in The Paradise.

207
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,690
失陪一下 先生
If you'll excuse me, sir?

208
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,100
这边
This way.

209
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,500
巴伦坦先生的账 谢谢
Mr Ballentine's accounts, please.

210
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,930
多么辉煌的企业!
What a splendid enterprise!

211
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,810
我们最近开了一家美食厅
We've recently opened a Food Hall.

212
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:34,010
我们的东洋式房间大受欢迎
We have an Oriental Room which has proved very popular.

213
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,370
我们打算进一些不同价位的商品
We try to stock items at a range of prices

214
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,570
来吸引各层次的顾客
to attract all manner of customers.

215
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,930
那些无法负担贵重商品的人
Those who can't afford the finer goods

216
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,570
仍可以进来观看它们
can still come in to gaze at them.

217
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,290
我们还有童装店
We have a Childrenswear department

218
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:49,330
床上用品 男装和家具 我们一直在努力扩大
Bedding, Menswear and Furniture. We're always looking to expand.

219
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,450
我有一个酒厂
I have a brewery.

220
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,625
从一瓶麦芽酒开始做起 到现在 
I started out with one ale, and now,

221
00:13:53,626 --> 00:13:56,850
我为这个城市超过一半的酒馆和旅店提供酒水
I supply more than half the inns and hostelries of the city.

222
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,890
除了这些
And beyond.

223
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:02,490
我或许应该歇歇了 但我仍然每天坚持工作
I may get short of breath, but I still go to work every day,

224
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,290
我仍然知道我每个供应商都姓什么
and I still know each employee by their first name.

225
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,050
我也知道你在想什么
I know what you're thinking.

226
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,970
应该在我们的美食厅提供您的酒
We ought to supply those ales of yours in our Food Hall!

227
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:17,010
感觉就像是... 就好像你的脚踩在轮子上
The idea...is to walk as though your feet were on wheels.

228
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:20,210
噢 像这样吗?
Oh. Like this?

229
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,490
不要一上一下的 手别动
Not up and down, no hands.

230
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,100
我们叫它"游步"... 苏西?
Er, "tripping", we call it...Susy?

231
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,250
非常好!
Wonderful!

232
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:35,570
把你的手放在前面 像这样 然后...
Place your hands in front, like this. And...

233
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,860
苏西?
Susy?

234
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,530
女人不要迈大步
Long strides are not feminine.

235
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,130
小步走 好吗?
Short strides. Yes?

236
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,380
小...步走
Short...strides.

237
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,992
每一步都要用你的优雅和平稳
Every step is meant to draw attention for 

238
00:14:48,993 --> 00:14:50,970
来吸引人们的注意
its grace and poise.

239
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,890
我不确定能有这种优雅和平稳!
I'm not sure I can do grace and poise!

240
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,090
那先走平稳了再考虑优雅吧
Perhaps try poise and worry about grace later.

241
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,235
我们一定要一起出去 
We must all go out together. 

242
00:14:58,236 --> 00:14:59,850
我请客 我们该去哪?
Be my treat. Where shall we go?

243
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,530
我们能参加的最盛大的晚会是什么?
What's the most lavish night out we could possibly have?

244
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,873
巴伦坦夫人... 
Er, Mrs Ballentine... 

245
00:15:03,874 --> 00:15:05,450
拜托 叫我露西尔...
Please, call me Lucille...

246
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,780
露西尔 不用这么破费
Lucille, there's no need for extravagance.

247
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,020
巴伦坦真英俊 不是吗?
Ballentine's so handsome, isn't he?

248
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:18,555
你丈夫一定很爱你 夫人 
Your husband clearly adores you, madam. 

249
00:15:18,556 --> 00:15:20,700
他有时也很风趣
He can be so funny sometimes.

250
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,380
我找不到比他更好的人了
I've never known a kinder man.

251
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,330
我想邀请你们都来我家里
I'm going to invite you all out to the house,

252
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,810
那一定是今年最快乐的聚会
and it will be the jolliest party of the year.

253
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,012
求你了 快说你会来! 
Please, say you'll come! 

254
00:15:35,013 --> 00:15:35,930
哦 我们很乐意去
Oh, we'd love to come.

255
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,791
我们还想参观下你家的吊灯呢 
We want to look at your chandeliers. 

256
00:15:37,792 --> 00:15:38,850
不是吗 克莱拉?
Don't we, Clara?

257
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:43,210
或者 有时我们周末会去野餐
Or, sometimes we have a picnic on Sundays.

258
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:46,130
我真高兴能认识你们
I am so glad I found you.

259
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:49,210
我最近见过的女人都是那种出身高贵
The only women I've met so far have been those well-to-do society wives

260
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,490
又瞧不起我的人
who look down their noses at me.

261
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,330
我喜欢野餐 来我家的花园一起坐坐
I love picnics. Come and sit in my garden.

262
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,370
我们一起喝香槟
We'll have champagne

263
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:59,540
还有烤肉和果汁...
and roasted meats and oranges...

264
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:03,500
我们都... 很愿意去 露西尔
We would all...love to come, Lucille.

265
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:13,596
我能请您喝杯白兰地吗 先生? 
Can I offer you a glass of brandy, sir? 

266
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,490
我一定要除掉他
I must be rid of him.

267
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:19,367
也许我们应该进里面谈 先生 
Perhaps we should speak inside, sir. 

268
00:16:19,368 --> 00:16:21,060
是的 当然
Yes. Yes of course.

269
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:27,250
我再也受不了他在这里作威作福了
I can't bear to watch him lord it about this place for one more day.

270
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:30,050
太匆忙可不太合适 威斯顿先生
Haste will not serve you well, Mr Weston.

271
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,384
如果您真下决心要除掉莫里先生
If you are determined to dispose of Mr Moray,

272
00:16:32,385 --> 00:16:34,210
可不能顺了他的意
 do not do so on his terms.

273
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:37,010
如果您现在解雇他 反而对他有利
If you dismiss him now, you will play into his hands.

274
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,820
- 他可能会翻身的 - 你什么意思?
- He would come out on top. - What do you mean?

275
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,450
我听说了一些事 先生
There are things I have heard, sir.

276
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,410
您会不会相信 这件事我知道得最清楚?
Will you trust that I know best in this?

277
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,890
让我来做些安排
Let me make some arrangements

278
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,140
我会把如何终结莫里的提案摆在您面前
and a proposal will be laid before you that will finish Moray.

279
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:57,730
五周年庆典! 我们会用丝带 彩旗和天堂鸟
A five-year celebration! We will deck the halls with ribbons, bunting

280
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:00,690
来装饰大厅给每一个顾客看
and a bird of paradise for every customer.

281
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:04,410
莫里先生 您的信
Mr Moray, sir, your messages.

282
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,020
达德利能处理这些事
Dudley can deal with these.

283
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,370
我只是借用它一下 不会偷走的
I'm only borrowing it, I'm not going to steal it!

284
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,370
我要用它来把活干完 不是吗?
I need it to get the job done, don't I?

285
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,010
好吧 下次最好找莫里先生或达德利先生
Well, next time ask Mr Moray or Mr Dudley,

286
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,970
或者任何比这梯子高的人
or someone else higher up the ladder.

287
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,210
看到这条街了吗?
You see this street?

288
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,250
我上上下下打量它
I look up and down it,

289
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,650
没有比我更早在这儿的人了
there's nobody that was here before me.

290
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,141
这意味着什么 
That means something. 

291
00:17:27,142 --> 00:17:29,610
这意味着你在这的时间太长了
Aye. It means you've been here a long time

292
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,055
该轮到你拉梯子了 
and it's your turn to pull up the ladder. 

293
00:17:31,056 --> 00:17:32,490
我们的德妮丝...
Our Denise...

294
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,650
跑到旅馆来责备我 她想要摆脱我
Coming to the inn to chide me. She wants rid of me.

295
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:38,090
她只怕也想把我推倒在路上
She might as well push me down the road.

296
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,370
她只想让你感到快乐 就这样 艾德蒙 
She just wants you to be happy, that's all, Edmund.

297
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,850
你肯定看得出吧
Surely you can see that.

298
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,420
我要把我的店从头到尾漆上颜色 然后
I'll paint my shop from top to bottom. And then...

299
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:51,250
如果你想的话 我星期天可以来帮你
I can help you out if you want, on Sunday.

300
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,490
礼拜天是我用来向着河的上流追女孩的
I'd only spend it chasing girls up the river.

301
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,380
或往下流追
Or chasing girls down the river.

302
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:59,340
这里就是我所知道的世界
Everything I know in this world is right here.

303
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,340
"店铺出售"

304
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,290
我很担心凯瑟琳
I am concerned for Katherine.

305
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,563
她丈夫的嫉妒心已经影响到她了 
Her husband's jealousy is telling on her. 

306
00:18:39,564 --> 00:18:40,770
我怕她可能会病倒
I fear she might fall ill.

307
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:43,170
那最好了
Well, that is all to the good.

308
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,330
你向她献殷勤的效果已经达...达到了
Your courting of her has w-worked to our favour.

309
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,970
我想向你说清楚
What I am trying to make clear to you is that

310
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:51,770
我不能继续欺骗下去了
I cannot continue with this deception.

311
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:55,210
汤姆・威斯顿是个非常危险又不稳定的人
Tom Weston is a dangerously volatile man.

312
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,650
他开始受压力的影响了
The pressure is telling on him.

313
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,690
- 我见过 - 那最好了
- I have seen it. - All to the good.

314
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,010
莫里先生 请容我说一句
Mr Moray, sir, if I may.

315
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,168
你已经演完你的角色了 
You have played your part. 

316
00:19:05,169 --> 00:19:06,090
而且做得很棒
And played it handsomely.

317
00:19:06,091 --> 00:19:08,005
现在 我们要带着我们的提议
= Now, we will approach Tom Weston

318
00:19:08,006 --> 00:19:08,724
去接近汤姆・威斯顿
 with our proposal.

319
00:19:08,725 --> 00:19:10,530
什么提议
What proposal?

320
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:13,530
约翰? 
John? 

321
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,113
- 约翰? - 乔纳斯 带他往这走 
- John? - Jonas, take him through this way. 

322
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:17,610
我不想让她发现你在这
I don't want her to find you here.

323
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,820
先生
Sir.

324
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,920
你在里面吗?
Are you in there?

325
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,220
约翰 你在里面吗?
John, are you in there?

326
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,730
你在和谁说话
Who were you talking to?

327
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:42,140
我刚反应过来 我肯定是在自说自话
It has finally come to it. I must have been talking to myself.

328
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:48,130
巴伦坦? 他把他所有的钱
Ballentine? He's spending all of his money

329
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,130
都花在一个比他女儿还年轻的老婆上了
on a wife who's young enough to be his daughter.

330
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,924
这男人已经被爱冲昏头脑了 
The man's mind is addled with love. 

331
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,410
这有什么错呢
And what's wrong with that?

332
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,570
没有 没有错
Nothing. Nothing's wrong with that.

333
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,610
一旦涉及生意上的事
When it comes to business matters,

334
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,050
他的脑子可比我们都敏锐
his mind is as sharp as the best of us.

335
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,530
我相信如果去向他提议...
I believe if we came to him with a proposal...

336
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:06,290
他的漂亮新娘很喜欢我们商场 亲爱的
He has a pretty bride who's taken a fancy to the store, darling,

337
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,570
我们没有理由相信这男人是个合适的投资者
those are not grounds for us to believe the man is a suitable investor.

338
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:13,133
你反对这个想法是因为是我向你提出的吗?
Are you opposed to the idea because I suggested it to you? 

339
00:20:13,134 --> 00:20:13,810
抱歉
I'm sorry.

340
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,760
我今天状态不佳 
I'm not at my best. 

341
00:20:15,761 --> 00:20:19,060
你怎么这么易怒 这么心烦的样子?
Why are you so irritable, so distracted?

342
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,980
是因为凯瑟琳吗
Is it Katherine?

343
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,450
什么意思
What do you mean?

344
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,814
我们去吃晚饭的时候我看到她是什么样了 
I saw how she was when we went to dinner. 

345
00:20:30,815 --> 00:20:32,050
她一句话都没说
She hardly said a word.

346
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,210
她已经愤怒至极了
She was festering with rage.

347
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:37,570
我觉得她的婚姻不幸福
I think she's unhappy in her marriage.

348
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,420
她差不多也是这么说的
She almost said as much.

349
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,060
你去看她了?
You went to see her?

350
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:48,530
是的 去求她拴住她的老公
Yes. Yes. To plead with her to rein in her husband.

351
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,980
他干涉店里的生意 
His dabbling in the business of the store 

352
00:20:49,981 --> 00:20:51,900
已经让这儿的日子很难过了
is making life here quite impossible.

353
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:57,850
但你没告诉我你会去见凯瑟琳
But you did not tell me you were going to see Katherine.

354
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:02,490
他们是我们的上司 我们尽量必须应付他们
While they are our masters, we must deal with them, as best we can.

355
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,860
当心点约翰
Be careful John.

356
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,980
凯瑟琳可没忘记 她永远也不会忘记的
Katherine has not forgotten. She'll never forget.

357
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:16,650
你不愿意卖 我接受
You do not wish to sell. I accept that.

358
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:19,050
我们应该相互理解
We shall both of us proceed on that understanding.

359
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:22,010
但如果我没有告诉你我的想法
But it would be duplicitous of me

360
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:25,570
那我就是个两面派了
were I not to advise you of my intentions.

361
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:29,450
我兄弟和我在曼切斯特和利物浦各有一家店
My brother and I have a store in Manchester and one in Liverpool.

362
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:33,810
我们希望向南部和北...北部扩张
We wish to expand south and, indeed, n-north.

363
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,890
我们的目标是成为第一个
Our intention is to be the first and, sir,

364
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:41,490
也是唯一一个国际连锁商城
the only, national formation of emporiums.

365
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,925
你是打算建在这里吗 
And you propose to build here? 

366
00:21:43,926 --> 00:21:47,050
我们有个施工地址 已经在起草计划了
We have a site. Plans are being drawn.

367
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:49,290
到目前为止 威斯顿先生
Up until now, Mr Weston,

368
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:53,290
只是些小商店与天堂百货之间的小打小闹
the battle has been between the small stores and The Paradise.

369
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,490
那种仗赢得很轻松
That war was easily won.

370
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,451
等我建好了
If I build 

371
00:21:57,452 --> 00:22:01,355
那则会发生一次完全不同规模的交锋
will be an almighty clash on an altogether different scale.

372
00:22:01,356 --> 00:22:02,770
一场价格战争
 A price war.

373
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:07,210
你的一些最佳员工可能会被更好的薪资所诱惑
Some of your best staff might well be tempted by better offers.

374
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:11,370
顾客会... 至少会分散
Customers will be, at the very least, divided.

375
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,500
为什么你提前警告我
Why would you wish to forewarn me?

376
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:20,940
这意味着我会防备 不让你得逞
It means that I might arm myself against your intentions.

377
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:24,740
因为这场战争我肯定能...能赢
It is a battle I W-WILL win.

378
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:30,610
但那肯定会用很多钱 我希望你
But it will be a costly affair. I would prefer you...

379
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:33,490
现在接受失败吗 在我自己家里?
To accept defeat now? In the comfort of my own home.

380
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:37,970
不是失败 不 应该是说个人的胜利
Not defeat, no. Perhaps a more personal triumph.

381
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,690
你应该赞同
You will appreciate that a businessman must be,

382
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,810
一个生意人是一根筋的
shall we say, "single-minded"?

383
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:48,010
如果我建好了 我想雇莫里做我的商场经理
If I build, I intend to employ Moray as my store manager

384
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:52,050
我会提供他足够的钱 只要能赢
and I will provide him with whatever funds are needed to succeed.

385
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,650
如果你把天堂商店卖给我
If you sell The Paradise to me,

386
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:57,290
我会把莫里解雇
I will cast Moray into the wilderness

387
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,780
永远驱逐他
never to return.

388
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,420
不
No.

389
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:16,530
我理解情感可能会战胜理智 先生
I understand that emotion might get the better of judgment, sir,

390
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:22,090
所以我给你一个礼拜
so I will wait for one week whilst you allow yourself some

391
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,970
让你在家好好考...考虑这件事
re-reflection on the matter.

392
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:29,210
让我解释一下
Let me explain.

393
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,930
你所描述的
What you describe,

394
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:33,970
芬顿先生 是些客观因素
Mr Fenton, are the circumstances.

395
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,650
你现在所应对的是一个男人
What you are dealing with is a man.

396
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:40,650
如果我对你的要求低头
If I surrender to your demand,

397
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:43,050
就会变成
it will be...

398
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,060
一个懦夫
..because I am a coward.

399
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:01,595
一旦你把名字拿下来 那就是结局了 是吗 
Once you take the name down, that really is the end, isn't it? 

400
00:24:01,596 --> 00:24:02,260
是的
It is.

401
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,450
是的 你必须得做 把它拿下来
Yeah, well, you have to. Take it down.

402
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,404
你不能给"艾德蒙・洛维特"涂上亮丽的新色
I mean, you can't paint Edmund Lovett 

403
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:09,890
再放上去了
back up there again

404
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,130
否则这看上去会成什么样
in bright new colours, cos what's that going to look like?

405
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,370
是啊 但如果我的名字不在店上
Yeah, but if my name's not above the shop,

406
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,490
那我是在卖什么?
what is it I'm supposed to be selling?

407
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,490
任何一个想买的人都会想知道
Anyone interested is going to want to know

408
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,050
他们要买下的一个经营发达的企业
they're buying a going concern.

409
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:23,010
- 你可以就写"服装店" - 你看吧 
You could just write up there - "Draper's Shop". There, you see!

410
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:26,490
- 从孩子的口中说出来了 - 是的好吧
- Straight from the mouths of babes. - Yeah... Well...

411
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,180
你是来提供意见的
It's for you to have opinions.

412
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,260
我是来做决定的
It's for me to decide.

413
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,615
多加一点 谢谢 
Oh, a little more, thank you. 

414
00:24:35,616 --> 00:24:37,690
你的花园真漂亮 露西尔
You have such a lovely garden, Lucille.

415
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,610
快吃 姑娘们
Eat up, girls.

416
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:43,290
你们没享受完可不许走
You're not allowed to leave until you are properly indulged.

417
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:46,170
四个女店员在一起 一个男人的影子都没有!
Four shop girls on a blanket and not a man in sight!

418
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,850
今天可没人会享受
No-one's going to be indulged today.

419
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,330
吃点肉
Have some meat.

420
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,900
有乡下人
There's peasant.

421
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:59,700
注: 英语中"乡下人"与"鸡肉"拼写相似

422
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,700
我意思说 鸡肉
I mean "pheasant".

423
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,730
在我家乡 "乡下人"是种美味佳肴
Where I come from, "peasant" is a delicacy.

424
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,370
有个蛋在最上面呢
We have it with an egg on top!

425
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,380
我是个乡下人
I'm a peasant.

426
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,500
实际上
As good as.

427
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:18,410
我知道你们都知道
I know you all know it.

428
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:21,210
我不知道怎么打扮 怎么走路 怎么说话
I don't know how to dress, how to walk, how to talk.

429
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,658
你们肯定很疑惑
You must be wondering 

430
00:25:22,659 --> 00:25:25,740
我怎么嫁得了巴伦坦这么好的丈夫!
how I got myself a husband like Ballentine!

431
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,100
这可不关我们事 露西尔
Well, it's none of our business, Lucille.

432
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,620
我想知道
I was wondering.

433
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,010
他病了
He was sick.

434
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,330
我是在看护他 然后
I was nursing him and, er...

435
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:41,890
男人们总是喜欢护士
Men always fall for the nurses.

436
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:45,010
好了 现在我们知道了 他能有你真幸运
There. Now, we know. He's a lucky man to have you.

437
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,410
还有"油炸杂种"和"乡下人"一起上吗?
Any fried mongrel to go with that peasant?

438
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,027
他生病时在医院追求你的吗?
Did he court you whilst he was sick in hospital? 

439
00:25:50,028 --> 00:25:51,890
我让他把我迷倒了
I let him woo me.

440
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:55,780
为什么不呢 我已经心碎很多次了
Why should I not? I've had my heart broke plenty of times.

441
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,820
当男人们病好了 就离开了
Men get well and they move away...

442
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:05,380
然后就忘记他们曾爱过
..and they forget they were in love.

443
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,770
我以为我已经没戏了
I thought my time had passed.

444
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:12,730
但巴伦坦没有忘记 他想要娶我
But Ballentine didn't forget. He wanted to marry me,

445
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:16,580
我知道这儿的夫人们都怎么看我
and I know what all the wives around here think of me.

446
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,100
你们肯定也这样想
You must be thinking the same.

447
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,060
我不过是有张漂亮脸蛋
I'm no more than a pretty face...

448
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:37,210
你和我们的唯一不同 露西尔
The only difference between you and us, Lucille,

449
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,210
就是你找到了一个好男人
is that you chased after a good man.

450
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,410
对吧 姑娘们
Isn't that right, girls?

451
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,184
你找到了一个丈夫 
You found a husband 

452
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:45,930
他唯一想做的事情就是让你开心
whose only desire is to make you happy.

453
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:49,330
如果你认为我们会因此而在这里评论你
If you think we're here to judge you for that,

454
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:51,330
那你就错了
then you're wrong.

455
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:02,140
谢谢你 谢谢你 克莱拉
Thank you. Thank you, Clara.

456
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:10,170
能向你求助真是给我很大的安慰 莫里
It truly is a comfort to me to have you to turn to, Moray.

457
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:12,890
我希望你能知道到我有多庆幸
I hope that you appreciate how grateful I am.

458
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:16,767
凯瑟琳 汤姆是在惩罚你
Katherine, Tom is punishing you 

459
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:17,850
因为我在这 会使他想起
because I'm here to remind him

460
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:20,570
我们之间的一些事情
of how things were between us.

461
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,540
这对他来说是一种挑衅
It is a provocation to him.

462
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:27,780
如果我们见面 我觉得情况会更加糟糕
If we see one another, I can't help thinking it will make this worse.

463
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:33,220
对我诚实 并对你自己也诚实
Be honest with me, be honest with yourself.

464
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,700
你认为我们这样下去会让情况好起来吗?
Do you suppose it will make things better if we continue like this?

465
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:44,570
我把你带回这里就是为了惩罚你
I brought you back here to punish you.

466
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,260
这不足以毁掉你
It wasn't enough to ruin you.

467
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:50,660
这还远达不到你抛弃我时带来的伤痛
That could never match the hurt I felt when you abandoned me.

468
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,253
我把你安排在那个职位 
I put you back in that place 

469
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:54,860
因此我可以看着你和德妮丝
so that I could watch you with Denise and...

470
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,580
我不在乎会花多长时间
..I didn't care how long it might take...

471
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,540
我想让她尝尝我的感受
I wanted her to feel as I felt.

472
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,850
害怕失去你
To be terrified of losing you.

473
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,300
然后 再失去你
And then, to lose you.

474
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,300
但是 现在
But now...

475
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,850
和你一起呆几分钟 感受你的温柔
A few moments alone with you, to feel your tenderness,

476
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,500
你的庇护 我现在不想伤害任何人
your protection... I don't want to hurt anyone now.

477
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,540
我只是想知道以后我们还会像现在这样
I only want to know that sometimes we can be like this.

478
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:26,570
- 不要将它夺走 - 汤姆会毁了你
Don't take that away from me. Tom will destroy you...

479
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,330
德妮丝也会毁了你
Denise will destroy you.

480
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,170
你想过这个吗?
Have you thought of that?

481
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:35,930
汤姆告诉了我他在店里所看见的
Tom told me what he sees in the store.

482
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,890
德妮丝很有野心
Denise has such ambition.

483
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,345
当他提议让她去巴黎的时候 
I saw her face when he suggested 

484
00:28:41,346 --> 00:28:43,850
我看到过她的表情
that she might go to Paris.

485
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,140
他说她将会超过你
He says she will outrun you...

486
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,410
你要我对你诚实 莫里
You asked me to be honest with you, Moray.

487
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:52,740
那我也恳求你认清事实
I implore you to meet truth with truth.

488
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,730
我所说的
What I describe,

489
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,420
你也看出来了吧?
is that what you see?

490
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,930
你安慰了我
You have comforted me.

491
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,460
我就不能安慰你吗
Can't I comfort you?

492
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:24,386
您有一个如此华丽的家 美好的生活
You have such a splendid home, a good life, 

493
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:26,290
一个可爱的妻子
a lovely wife,

494
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,690
但是
but...

495
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,820
为什么我不退休呢 为什么要呢
Why do I not retire? Why should I?

496
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:35,530
曾有好几次机会我可以卖掉我的啤酒厂
Oh, I've had several opportunities to sell my brewery,

497
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:38,050
但是我从未动心
but I've never been tempted.

498
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,890
是工作让我一直在继续
It's what keeps me going, work.

499
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,170
让我一直思维敏捷
Keeps me sharp.

500
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:46,610
每一个新的挑战都要花费我十年光阴
Every new challenge takes ten years off my age!

501
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,940
好吧 可能是五年
Well, maybe five.

502
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:54,290
我生产啤酒 我感觉我已经竭尽所能
I make beer, and I feel I've done all I can

503
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,370
把麦芽酒推向全国
selling ales to the nation.

504
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:59,728
我还要再一次征战商场
I want one more business conquest

505
00:29:59,729 --> 00:30:01,860
好使我再年轻起来
 to make me young again.

506
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:08,690

我听说莫里想筹集资金买回他的商场
Now I hear that Moray is trying to raise funds to buy back his store

507
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,850
但没取得成功
without much success.

508
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,660
他是怎么失去它的?
How did he come to lose it?

509
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:17,340
他 坠入了爱河
He...fell in love.

510
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:21,220
他放弃了他的所有来爱这个女孩
He gave up all that he had to be true to his girl.

511
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,780
我听过这些故事
Aye, I've heard the stories.

512
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,690
这使我更喜欢他了
It rather endears him to me.

513
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:32,650
另一方面也是因为我在我的暮年变得浪漫了
But then, I have become something of a romantic in my old age,

514
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:35,290
正如你所见 德妮丝
as you can see, Denise.

515
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,170
巴伦坦先生 您可以见见莫里先生吗?
Mr Ballentine, might you meet with Mr Moray

516
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:41,570
好让他能给您投资天堂百货的提议
so that he might put before you a proposal to invest in The Paradise?

517
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:45,810
这是一个健全的 有广泛扩张潜力的企业
It is a sound enterprise, with potential for extensive expansion.

518
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:48,410
我们不会受时尚变化无常的影响
We are not vulnerable to the whims of fashion,

519
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:51,690
事实上 我们总是在走在顾客的前面
in fact, we are always ahead of our customers.

520
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,410
当时尚生产商创造新产品时
As modern manufacturing creates new goods,

521
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:56,090
我们是第一个供应给消费者的
we are the first to offer them.

522
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,290
越来越多的人来到这个城市
More and more people are coming to the city,

523
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,970
我是这样 你的妻子也是这样
as I did, as your wife did,

524
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:02,810
客人想要的是新潮的 有魅力的
and what they want is the new, the glamorous,

525
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,410
外国货
foreign goods.

526
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,730
人们想要改变 天堂百货就是一个天堂
People want betterment, and The Paradise is a haven

527
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,540
他们想要这里都有
for all that they wish for.

528
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,003
既然你做得这么好 
Why would I want Moray 

529
00:31:11,004 --> 00:31:13,690
为什么会想让莫里来给我提议呢?
to present to me when you do it so admirably?

530
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:17,370
对不起 我太得意忘形了
Oh! I'm sorry, I got carried away...

531
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:20,770
不要对你所擅长的东西说抱歉
Nae, don't apologise for what you're good at.

532
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,490
我想要一个儿子
I wanted a son.

533
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,890
一个能继承我的生意的儿子
Someone who would take on my business

534
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,100
然后在他那一代使其繁荣
and make it flourish for his own generation.

535
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,130
如果我真有这样一个儿子
If I'd had the son I'd wished for,

536
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:32,380
他肯定就像你一样 德妮丝
he'd have been just like you, Denise.

537
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:36,810
现在 你写一份正式的提案
Now, you put together a formal proposition

538
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,460
我会好好考虑的
and I'll consider it.

539
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:45,130
艾德蒙 不得不这么说 你做得真不错
It's a fine job you're doing, Edmund. It has to be said.

540
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,916
对啊 你知道接下来会怎么样
Yes, so fine you know what's coming,

541
00:31:46,917 --> 00:31:48,010
对吧 梅尔托?
 don't you, Myrtle?

542
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,738
确实 当他完成外面的后 
I do. When he's finished the outside, 

543
00:31:49,739 --> 00:31:51,170
他又会想把里面弄一遍
it'll cross his mind to do the inside.

544
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,946
所以里外都会变成一样 
Just so they're all the same, like. 

545
00:31:52,947 --> 00:31:54,170
当他完成里面后
And when he's done the inside...

546
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:57,130
他会后退一步欣赏他的作品 然后说
He'll step back and admire his handiwork and say...

547
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:59,036
当我把它弄得如此辉煌后
"Seems a shame to leave the place 

548
00:31:59,037 --> 00:32:01,450
再离开这个地方似乎是一件憾事
when I've got it looking so splendid!"

549
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,690
来吧 艾德蒙 吃蛋糕吧
Come on, Edmund, eat your cake.

550
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,570
艾德蒙 来吧 吃蛋糕了 艾德蒙
Edmund? Come on, eat your cake. Edmund...?

551
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:09,450
莫里 德妮丝可能正好找到你所要找的东西了
Moray, Denise may well have found exactly what you are looking for.

552
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,730
巴伦坦先生说好愿意投资
Mr Ballentine as good as said he's willing to invest.

553
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,090
他想让你见见他
He'd like you to meet with him.

554
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,857
凯瑟琳和汤姆不想卖
Katherine and Tom are not minded to sell. 

555
00:32:14,858 --> 00:32:17,356
如果他们认为我们在对他们玩花样 
It would antagonise them if they thought 

556
00:32:17,357 --> 00:32:18,450
说不定会反击的
we were manoeuvring against them.

557
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,850
当然有资金投入是没有坏处的
Surely there's no harm in having the funding in place?

558
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:23,250
我们必须找最优的投资
We must find investment that is from the best source

559
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,170
同时也得在最合适的时机
that comes at the most favourable time.

560
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,020
莫里先生 你的信件
Mr Moray, sir, your messages.

561
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:31,140
我知道 先生 达德利先生会处理
I know, sir. Mr Dudley will deal with them.

562
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:45,130
我真渴望回到我们天真无邪的时候
I long to go back to that time of innocence between us.

563
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:47,420
我们两个在夜里说着悄悄话
The two of us just talking in the dark.

564
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:51,610
亲爱的 我们从来没有天真无邪的时候
Sweetheart, it was never innocent.

565
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:55,490
你当时定了婚 而我是为你工作的售货员
You were engaged to be married, and I was a shop girl working for you.

566
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,530
重重困难摆在我们面前
Things have always been difficult,

567
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,850
可我们坚持下来了 因为我们爱着彼此
but we persevered because we love one another.

568
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,450
现在也是这样
It's the same now.

569
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:05,090
有时候 我多希望你没有在这工作
Sometimes, I wish you just didn't work here.

570
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,530
我希望我们在街上邂逅
I wish we'd met in the street.

571
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,970
我只想我们能够爱着对方
I just want us to be able to love one another

572
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:12,490
一切只要简简单单就好 这有什么问题呢
and for it all to be simple. What is wrong with that?

573
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,850
这没有问题
There's nothing wrong with that.

574
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,500
我认为这叫做浪漫
I think they call it romance.

575
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,130
你认为我们要和莫里对着干吗?
You think we should defy Moray?

576
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,770
不要那样说
Let's not call it that.

577
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:29,188
应该说是帮助 只是没让他知道 或者同意 
Let's call it helping. Without his knowledge. Or consent.

578
00:33:29,189 --> 00:33:33,380
但是尽管是帮助 如果我们能弄到可行的资金
But helping nonetheless. If we can secure workable funds...

579
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:38,500
威斯顿夫妇在逼约翰 达德利
The Westons are crushing John, Dudley.

580
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:43,330
我们应该要做一些事情 即使只是
We have to do something. Even if it only amounts

581
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:46,140
给他一点点继续下去的希望
to giving him a little bit of hope to carry on.

582
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:51,100
我不确定私底下行动是最好的方式 德妮丝
I'm not sure that acting secretly is the best way, Denise.

583
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,530
我不知道梅尔托在她的糕点里放了什么
I don't know what Myrtle puts in her pastry,

584
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:58,770
她说她有一种秘制调料
she says she has a secret ingredient.

585
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:01,130
只要不是她的脚趾甲
Provided it's not her toenails,

586
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:04,410
如果尝起来还不错 我就不需要知道
I don't need to know as long as it tastes good.

587
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:06,570
噢 德妮丝 你叔叔今天吃了什么?
Eh, Denise, what is eating up your uncle?

588
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:09,570
他甚至都不吃我的蛋糕
I couldn't even get him to eat my cake today.

589
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:12,010
我必须去对面看看他 我一直很忙
I must go across and see him, I've been so busy.

590
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:14,850
或许他已知道你在蛋糕里放了什么 梅尔托
Perhaps he's wise to what you put in your recipe, Myrtle.

591
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:24,130
我知道当我和巴伦坦在一起的时候人们在看我
I see people looking at me when I'm with Ballentine.

592
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:27,290
当我把他带进商场时我看到你也有同样的神情
I saw it on your face when I brought him into the store.

593
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,013
为什么要在意别人怎么看你呢? 
What does it matter what others think of you? 

594
00:34:29,014 --> 00:34:31,450
因为那是真的啊
Because it's true.

595
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,780
一定是真的
It must be true.

596
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:37,690
他对我越好我越内疚
The more kindness he shows to me, the more guilty I feel.

597
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,500
我做错了 我不得不承认 我得承认 
I made a mistake. I have to admit it, I have to.

598
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:47,500
我要离开他
I will leave him.

599
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:51,540
这样对待一个爱你的男人不是很残忍么?
Isn't that a cruel thing to do to a man who loves you?

600
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,780
我留下更是对他的残忍
It's more cruel if I stay.

601
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:13,370
凯瑟琳?
Katherine?

602
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,900
凯瑟琳?
Katherine?

603
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:25,130
不要不懂装懂
Don't pretend to know or understand anything you don't.

604
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:28,810
他有那么多年的从商经验 他会看出来的
He's a businessman of many years' experience. He will know.

605
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:31,930
把数据弄得简单些 别抬高夸大
Keep the figures simple - don't inflate or exaggerate.

606
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:34,340
如果被他发现 你就会失去他
If he catches you out, then you've lost him.

607
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:38,090
如果你跟我一块去不会更好吗?
Wouldn't it be better if you came with me?

608
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,890
不 不会的
No, it wouldn't.

609
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,860
为什么?
But, why wouldn't it?

610
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:46,770
因为是你找到巴伦坦的啊 他是你的战利品
Because you found Ballentine, he's your conquest.

611
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,060
没有人
There's no-one here.

612
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:00,260
达德利先生 你刚说的不是真的原因吧?
What you just told me, Mr Dudley, that's not the true reason, is it?

613
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:05,770
我去呢 会给他展示数据 他也会觉得我
I would present Mr Ballentine with figures, and he would see in me

614
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:08,540
是个信得过的合作者 而你去呢?
a man who could be trusted with his investment. You?

615
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:12,610
德妮丝 你的风采能照亮整个洽谈室
You would light up the room, Denise.

616
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:16,130
我擅长我正在做的 也能把它做得最好
I'm good at what I do. The best at my own job.

617
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:19,530
但像这种事就需要个企业家来完成了
But something like this takes an entrepreneur.

618
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:22,349
我只想看看当我告诉约翰我们有出路时
I just want to see the look on John's face when I tell him

619
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:23,010
他的表情
 we have a way out.

620
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:25,380
你会看到的 德妮丝 你会的
And you will, Denise. You will.

621
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,770
走吧 该走了
Go on, go.

622
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:31,060
去睡觉 祝你好运
Go to bed. And good luck.

623
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,370
出发咯
Walk on!

624
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,620
德妮丝...
Denise...

625
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:10,730
先生 威斯顿先生在军队时发生了点事
There is something about Mr Weston's time in the army, sir.

626
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:14,130
一些他无法提起的事
Something he cannot bear to speak about.

627
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:17,610
德妮丝刚坐马车走了 她去哪了?
Denise has just left the street in a carriage. Where has she gone?

628
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:20,220
先生 您最好还是问达德利先生吧
You might be better asking Mr Dudley about that, sir.

629
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,490
克莱拉? 克莱拉?
Clara? Clara?

630
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,010
我不知道我在想什么
I don't know what possessed me

631
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,210
而跟你说了关于我丈夫的那些事
to say such things to you about my husband.

632
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:32,020
我睡不着觉担心...
I couldn't sleep for fear that...

633
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:36,650
你没把我说的话告诉给别人吧 有吗?
You didn't tell anyone what I said to you, did you?

634
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,130
没什么可以告诉别人的
There was nothing to tell.

635
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:40,050
我会受不了的 如果巴伦坦知道了
I couldn't bear it if Ballentine found out.

636
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,807
知道了我对你说的那些 
I mean, found out what I'd been saying. 

637
00:37:41,808 --> 00:37:43,420
可你不是心意已决么?
But your mind is made up?

638
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:49,620
噢! 我还没见过这些披肩呢
Oooh! I've not seen these shawls before.

639
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:54,450
你喜欢吗? 克莱拉 我们都得有一条
Do you like them? We must both have one, Clara.

640
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:57,290
没必要这么做巴伦坦太太
There's no need for that, Mrs Ballentine.

641
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,730
我只想让你知道你对我有多重要
I just want to show you what you mean to me. 

642
00:37:59,731 --> 00:38:00,490
我有朋友了
I have a friend.

643
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,740
我有真正的朋友了
I have a true friend.

644
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,810
我希望你收下它
I want you to have this.

645
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:07,651
我不能收的 
I can't accept that from you. 

646
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:09,730
好嘛 你一定要收下 这代表你是我的
Please. You must. To show you.

647
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,330
朋友 我信赖的朋友
Friends. Trusted friends.

648
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,730
商场有相关的规定的
There are rules about such things in the store.

649
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,050
如果我收了 我会丢了工作的
If I accept that, I could lose my position.

650
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:18,810
不要告诉他们啊 就我俩知道
Then don't tell them. Be between us.

651
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:22,050
你觉得你能买到我的同情? 我的沉默?
Do you think you can buy my sympathy, my silence?

652
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,890
我的友情?
Buy my friendship?

653
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,570
你只是我的客人
You're a customer.

654
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,620
除此之外我们没别的关系
You are no more to me than that.

655
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,580
芙罗拉?
Flora?

656
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,501
明年的预期收入... 
The projected income for the next year... 

657
00:39:13,502 --> 00:39:14,980
是的 先生?
Yes, sir?

658
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:19,570
我以为会多一点的 是出了什么问题吗?
I imagined it might be more. Is there a problem?

659
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,450
我是有点太谨慎了
I have erred on the side of caution.

660
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,890
但错误的期望会导致失望的
False expectations create disappointment

661
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,290
也会有失败感
and a sense of failure.

662
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,850
我预计的和我们做到的
What I have predicted and what we reach for

663
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,850
是两回事
are not the same thing.

664
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:33,300
那德妮丝你有你们能做到的预期收入么?
And do you have figures for what you might reach for, Denise?

665
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:44,420
为什么莫里不亲自来介绍呢?
Why did Moray not make this presentation himself?

666
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:48,810
先生请您原谅他这个小疏忽
Please, don't hold this one small omission against him, sir.

667
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:51,050
莫里白手起家 创立天堂百货
Moray has built The Paradise from nothing.

668
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:54,060
他比所有人都清楚怎么经营好这间百货
He knows better than anyone how to make the store a success.

669
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:59,260
德妮丝 我很满意你提的方案
Your proposal meets with my satisfaction, Denise.

670
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:03,740
但我还有一些其它因素要考虑
But I have other considerations to take into account.

671
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:08,406
我会很快答复你的
I will not keep you waiting too long for an answer. 

672
00:40:08,407 --> 00:40:09,700
谢谢你 先生
Thank you, sir.

673
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:13,690
他是个幸运的家伙
He's a very fortunate fellow.

674
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,340
希望他知道
I hope he knows it.

675
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,450
我看到她坐在我的凳子上...
I found her sitting in my chair...

676
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:21,410
就像她在试宝座似的
As though she were trying out the throne.

677
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:24,490
你以为我没做过这事么? 还有山姆
Do you suppose I haven't done the same? And Sam?

678
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,010
我上次还看到亚瑟坐在上面呢
I once found Arthur sitting there.

679
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:29,730
莫里 每个人都有权利做白日梦的
We're all allowed to daydream, Moray.

680
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:31,780
又不会有什么坏处
There's no harm in it.

681
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:37,090
抱歉 好像是我自己在钻牛角尖 是吧?
I'm sorry, I seem to be jumping at shadows, don't I?

682
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,248
你知道为什么吗?
You know why? 

683
00:40:38,249 --> 00:40:40,690
因为你被和乔纳斯和芬顿的勾当蒙蔽了
You're consumed with such underhand business

684
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:43,130
你甚至已经看不到
with Jonas and Fenton that you refuse to notice

685
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:46,740
巴伦坦是你最好的投资人 究竟为什么啊?
that Ballentine's the perfect financier for you. Why is that?

686
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:51,940
因为是... 德妮丝找到他的
Because Denise...found him.

687
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:53,933
是她争取到的 
She wooed him. 

688
00:40:53,934 --> 00:40:55,437
这是她为你准备的礼物啊!
She brought you a gift! 

689
00:40:55,438 --> 00:40:56,690
她这么做是为了你啊!
She did it for you!

690
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,340
因为她爱你
Because she loves you.

691
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:02,010
你看不见真正重要的东西
You've lost sight of what really matters.

692
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:04,130
你反倒宁愿去跟凯瑟琳・威斯顿混在一起
Instead you prefer to dally with Katherine Weston

693
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:05,640
希望能... 
in the hope that you can...

694
00:41:05,641 --> 00:41:07,140
谁知道你想干嘛
who knows what.

695
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:14,290
达德利 我成大傻瓜了
I've been an almighty fool, Dudley.

696
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:17,420
的确 那你现在想怎么补救?s
You have. And what do you propose to do about it?

697
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:43,380
凯瑟琳 我去你房间不是去吓你的
I did not come to your room to frighten you, Katherine.

698
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,180
我只想去看看你
I came to look at you.

699
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:57,340
我接受出售天堂百货的提议了
I've received an offer to sell The Paradise.

700
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:00,890
你怎么会愿意的呢?
Why would you want to do such a thing?

701
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,860
因为这样是最好的
I've decided it is for the best.

702
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,639
不 你不能这么做 
No. You can't. 

703
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,100
我可以 我是你的丈夫
I can. I'm your husband.

704
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:11,570
我的决定说了算
What I decide will prevail.

705
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:13,540
但这不合理啊...
But it makes no sense...

706
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:23,100
凯瑟琳 我昨晚去你房间是想告诉你...
Last night, Katherine, I came to your room to tell you...

707
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,780
我不想失去你
I don't want to lose you.

708
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:31,220
如果我们能停止会怎么样?
What if we were to stop?

709
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,060
停止...
Stop...

710
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:37,660
折磨彼此
punishing one another.

711
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,140
如果我们能说...
What if we were to say...

712
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,820
我们结婚了
we are married now.

713
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,220
我们能好好地一块生活
We can make a life.

714
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:53,220
芙罗拉爱你
Flora adores you.

715
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:57,540
我们有个孩子要照顾
We have a child to care for.

716
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:19,170
我答应你 我永远都在这
I promise you, I will always be here.

717
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:20,620
绝不食言
I will not break my word.

718
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:31,090
'我亲爱的莫里
'My dear Moray.

719
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:33,130
我不得不再一次利用
I must put upon your good nature

720
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:36,690
你的好脾气和善良 请求你
and your kindness towards me once more, and ask that you

721
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,420
马上过来见我'
come to meet with me urgently.'

722
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:49,810
'请原谅我的匆忙 看到你时我会向你解释的
'Please forgive my haste, I will explain when I see you.

723
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:52,100
凯瑟琳'
Katherine.'

724
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:55,410
约翰?
John?

725
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:57,130
你出去么?
Are you going out?

726
00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:01,170
亲爱的 我约了坎贝尔・巴伦坦
Darling, I have an appointment to see Campbell Ballentine.

727
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:04,460
- 我听你的话去找他 - 太棒了
- I took your advice and approached him. - That's wonderful.

728
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:07,500
我太开心了
I'm so pleased.

729
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:31,130
- 你是克莱拉 没错吧? - 没错 先生
- It's Clara, isn't it? - It is, sir.

730
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:32,254
抱歉 失陪了 
If you'll excuse me. 

731
00:44:32,255 --> 00:44:33,740
克莱拉我有点事跟你说
I'd like a word with you, Clara.

732
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:46,457
你告诉他了吗? 
Did you tell him? 

733
00:44:46,458 --> 00:44:47,426
我才不会说呢 
I wouldn't do such a thing. 

734
00:44:47,427 --> 00:44:48,810
你说了 我看到了
You did. I saw you.

735
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:50,490
我看到你和我的丈夫在聊天
I saw you speaking with my husband.

736
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:51,630
他是在邀请我 
He was inviting me, 

737
00:44:51,631 --> 00:44:53,890
邀请所有的女孩去他的生日派对
inviting all of the girls, to his birthday party,

738
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,060
来取悦你
to please YOU.

739
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:57,734
就是这个!你明白了吧!
There! Do you see now? 

740
00:44:57,735 --> 00:44:59,530
你明白我必须要离开他的理由了吧?
Do you see now why I must leave him?

741
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:00,959
明白什么啊? 
WHAT is there to see? 

742
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,010
我配不上这样一个好男人
I don't deserve a man like him.

743
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:04,930
他对我的爱越深
The more devoted he is to me,

744
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:07,930
他就越难发现我真正的样子
the more I wait for the day when he sees me as I truly am.

745
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:09,949
我骗了他 我魅惑了他 
I tricked him. I bewitched him. 

746
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:11,340
你是什么意思?
What do you mean?

747
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:17,620
当我照顾他的时候 有一天晚上...
When I was nursing him, there was one night...

748
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:23,260
他看起来那么的英俊 他睡着的时候...
He looked so handsome, when he was sleeping and...

749
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:26,700
我情不自禁地...
...I couldn't seem to stop myself.

750
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:29,300
我吻了他
I kissed him.

751
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:33,970
我感觉他的灵魂在睡梦中被我偷走了
I feel like I've stolen his soul in his sleep

752
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:35,660
这就是他爱我的原因
and that's why he loves me.

753
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:40,850
你为什么要用这种迷信来折磨自己呢?
Why would you torment yourself with such superstition?

754
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:44,290
您真的认为他这么容易被瞒骗吗?
Do you really think he's so easily fooled?

755
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:47,930
你没有偷走他的爱 也没有欺骗他
You did not steal his love, you did not trick him.

756
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:50,530
请听我说
Look, listen to me.

757
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:52,570
- 你爱他吗? - 当然!
- Do you love him? - Of course!

758
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:54,530
那就好好爱他
Then LOVE him.

759
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:56,250
那就是他所期望的全部
That's all he wants from you.

760
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:58,740
真心爱他 你就能摆脱你的心魔
Love him and you'll be rid of your torments.

761
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:02,238
如果你离开了他 
If you leave him, 

762
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:04,930
你就会在余生中不断地诅咒自己
you will curse yourself for the rest of your days.

763
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:08,370
让那些别人的看法见鬼去吧
To hell with what other people think of you.

764
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:10,570
你的丈夫真心爱慕你
Your husband adores you.

765
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:14,010
拥有这样一位爱人你很幸运
You've been lucky in finding such a man.

766
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:16,540
为什么不去接受这份幸运呢?
Why not just accept your luck?

767
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:27,050
好 谢谢你
Yes, thank you.

768
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:34,170
为什么如此吃惊呢 德妮丝
Don't look so startled, Denise.

769
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:37,290
我以为你见到我会很开心
I thought you'd be pleased to see me.

770
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:39,740
是很开心 巴伦坦先生 只是...
I am, Mr Ballentine. It's just...

771
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:44,130
很高兴见到您
I am glad to see you.

772
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:46,650
我本希望莫里至少能够
I had hoped that Moray would have the good grace

773
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:48,730
爽快的给我个信儿
to send me a note at least.

774
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:51,450
他还没有联系您吗?
He's made no contact with you?

775
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:53,300
不过这也无妨
Perhaps that is just as well.

776
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:57,210
我被这个地方迷住了 德妮丝
I am tempted by this place, Denise.

777
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:59,210
我想投资
I want to invest.

778
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:03,210
这个消息真是太棒了 谢谢您
Well, that is wonderful news. Thank you.

779
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:06,890
但是同时我也考虑了另外的可能...
But one of the things I've had to consider is this...

780
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:11,090
不如我买下整个商店 安排一位经理
I could just as well buy the store. Put in a manager.

781
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:14,330
一个我可以信任 可以寄予希望的人
Someone I could trust, someone I have faith in.

782
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:17,050
一个有远见 抱负的...
Someone with vision, ambition...

783
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:21,650
先生 我恳请您在做出任何这样的考量之前
Please, sir, before any such considerations,

784
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:24,130
和莫里见一次面
I implore you to meet with Moray,

785
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:26,810
听听他对于这个地方的看法
hear him talk about this place.

786
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:30,250
我敢肯定 您会想要和他做生意
I am certain you'll want to do business with him.

787
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:31,580
好的
Very well.

788
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:34,983
这件事上我相信你的判断力 德妮丝 
I will trust your judgment in this, Denise. 

789
00:47:34,984 --> 00:47:35,970
谢谢您 先生!
Thank you, sir!

790
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:37,580
还有...
And...

791
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:41,620
谢谢您
Thank you.

792
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:49,701
你可以转行啦 艾德蒙 
You could take on a new calling, Edmund. 

793
00:47:49,702 --> 00:47:51,580
我的房子也得好好刷一刷!
My house needs painting!

794
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:57,380
我知道我不能永远呆在这儿
I know I can't stay here.

795
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:01,420
我知道我已经结婚了
I know I'm a married man.

796
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:05,580
我有了全新的生活 我知道
I have a new life. I know it.

797
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:16,100
我觉得我过去的生活被带走了
I feel like my old life's been taken away from me.

798
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:18,940
被硬生生地夺走了
I've been robbed of it.

799
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:23,460
我无法放手
I can't let it go.

800
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:27,060
还不行
Not yet.

801
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:30,610
不能就这样
Not like this.

802
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:33,770
艾德蒙!
Edmund!

803
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:36,930
艾德蒙 怎么了? 慢点 慢点! 艾德蒙!
Edmund, what's wrong? Easy, easy! Edmund!

804
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:39,850
你还好吗?
You all right?

805
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:41,660
艾德蒙!
Edmund!

806
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:44,820
叔叔!
Uncle!

807
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:47,810
艾德蒙 快去!
Edmund. Go!

808
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:49,650
叔叔!
Uncle!

809
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:51,130
帮忙啊!
Get help!

810
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:53,060
艾德蒙叔叔? 我是德妮丝!
Uncle Edmund? It's Denise!

811
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:05,300
他会好起来的
He will recover from this.

812
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:09,940
他需要休息 长时间的休息
He'll need rest. A lifetime of rest.

813
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:15,540
他对我就像是父亲一样
He's been like a father to me.

814
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:21,180
我只顾着忙我自己的事情 都没有时间陪他
I was so caught up in my own concerns, I had no time for him.

815
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:27,380
最后一次和他说话的时候 我还在责备他
The last time I spoke to him, I was chiding him.

816
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,539
那下次你再和他说话的时候 
Then next time you speak to him, 

817
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:33,090
一定要让他开心地笑
be sure to make him laugh.

818
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:54,141
约翰在哪里? 
Where's John? 

819
00:49:54,142 --> 00:49:55,690
要是他知道发生了什么
If he knew what had happened,

820
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:58,540
他肯定会想要来陪着你
I am certain he would want to be with you here.

821
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:04,020
你没有回答我的问题 达德利
You haven't answered my question, Dudley.

822
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:06,820
他在哪儿?
Where is he?

823
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:27,060
感谢你的到来
Thank you for coming.

824
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:40,890
- 凯瑟琳... - 能否让我说呢?
- Katherine... - Will you allow me to speak

825
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:43,140
我已经想明白了 而且也下定决心了
while it is all clear to me and I have the resolve?

826
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:49,490
我现在是一位母亲了
I am a mother now.

827
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:52,820
我要对我的孩子负责
I have the responsibility of a child.

828
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:56,610
我忍不住要去想象我的行为
I can't bear to think that my actions

829
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:58,860
可能会让我的亲爱的女儿感到恐惧
might cause fear for that dear girl.

830
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:04,060
你明白了吗?
Do you see?

831
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:07,860
我必须阻止自己再和你单独见面了
I must forbid myself from seeing you alone.

832
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:11,820
是的
Yes.

833
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:15,090
是的 我明白
Yes, I see.

834
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:16,980
这是最后一次了
This must be the last time.

835
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:24,060
那我不希望再让你背负更多的不安了 凯瑟琳
Then I would not want to burden you with any more anxiety, Katherine.

836
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:28,460
- 我会离开的... - 要不...
- I will go... - Perhaps...

837
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:31,820
...再坐一会儿吧
...a few moments more.

838
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:44,260
当我独自一人时 我的思绪被理性主宰
When I am alone my thoughts are governed by reason.

839
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:50,460
但是和你在一起时 一切就不同了
But when I am with you, it is different.

840
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:57,900
我被想要见到你想要触碰你手的念头给征服了
I am overcome with the wish just to look at you, to touch your hand.

841
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:08,180
我说过 我希望你在痛苦的时候能来找我
I said I wanted you to come to me in your distress.

842
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:15,380
我对你的关心 凯瑟琳 一直是非常真诚的
My concern for you, Katherine, has been entirely genuine.

843
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:18,690
我希望你能了解
I want you to know that.

844
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:20,300
- 我今天来是... - 不!
- When I came here today... - No!

845
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:53,460
我爱德妮丝
I love Denise.

846
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:56,931
我不能以任何的... 
I cannot in any way... 

847
00:52:56,932 --> 00:52:58,290
你一直都钟情于她吗?
You were always true to her?

848
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,180
是的 全心全意
With all my heart, yes.

849
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:22,740
我要自己站起来
I will stand on my own.

850
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:44,340
凯瑟琳?
Katherine?

851
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:09,380
是不是他害你这样的?
Did HE do this to you?

852
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:22,340
我不能控制自己
I can't help myself.

853
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:37,020
德妮丝...
Denise...

854
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:45,860
对不起 我没能陪着你
I'm sorry I wasn't here with you.

855
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:50,220
你刚才和凯瑟琳在一起 对不对?
You were with Katherine, weren't you?

856
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:56,860
看着我 告诉我你去哪了?
Look at me and tell me where you've been.

857
00:54:58,540 --> 00:54:59,980
我...
I've...

858
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:03,300
我是和凯瑟琳在一起
I've been with Katherine.

859
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:12,620
但我没有背叛你
I've not betrayed you.

860
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:17,780
我想和我叔叔独处
I wish to be alone with my uncle.

861
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:25,700
求你了 让我在叔叔身边安静地坐一会儿
Please, let me sit in peace with my uncle.

862
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:56,980
这真是太棒了
It really is. It's wonderful.

863
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:01,620
- 都满意吗? - 都满意
- All is well? - All is well.

864
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:35,650
我觉得是时候退休了 是不是?
I think it's about time I retired, isn't it?

865
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:39,890
我不会责备您的 如果这就是您想要的
I am not going to chide you, if that's what you want.

866
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:41,570
我只想喝一杯茶
What I want is a cup of tea.

867
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:44,210
您一直说我泡的茶是世界上最难喝的
You always said I make the worst tea in the world.

868
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:47,020
那就来一杯世界上最难喝的茶吧
Then I want a cup of the worst tea in the world.

869
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:53,340
为什么只有痛苦才能教会我们珍惜所拥有的?
Why is it that pain has to teach us what is right under our noses?

870
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:56,610
我爱慕奥德丽整整二十三年
23 years I've loved Audrey,

871
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:58,330
没想到有美梦成真的一天
never believing it would be.

872
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:01,130
现在她为我守候 而我却为了维护一点自尊心
Now, she's waiting for me and I fight it

873
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:03,020
而抗拒这件事情
to hold on to a bit of pride.

874
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:08,730
好吧...
Well...

875
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:11,170
我不会再抗拒了 德妮丝
I'm done fighting now, Denise.

876
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:33,980
德妮丝 我希望你不要...
Denise, I don't want you to...

877
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:39,620
我知道这一定...
I know this must be...

878
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:44,090
请你一定不要走
You must not think of leaving.

879
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:47,500
我不会走的 我属于这里
I am not going to leave. I belong here.

880
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:04,010
我想要向你们介绍一位非常特殊的客人
I'd like to introduce you all to someone very special.

881
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:07,130
这个国家最具盛名的摄影师之一
One of the most celebrated photographers in all of the land.

882
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:09,314
你看上去糟糕透了
You look like hell. 

883
00:58:07,314 --> 00:58:09,314
注: hell也指地狱

884
00:58:09,315 --> 00:58:10,850
我觉得我正往地狱走呢
One feels that's exactly where I'm headed.

885
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:13,890
我们的关系只不过是一个痛苦的故事的结语
Our case was nothing more than an epilogue to an arduous tale.

886
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:16,410
- 我见过鬼 - 那只是你的幻想
- I've seen things. - You've imagined things.

887
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:17,690
哦 有鬼!
Oh, it is!

888
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:20,170
这儿有鬼啊!
It's here!
