1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:03,630
数学推导出来的
The math is all there.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:05,560
- 这不可能  - 有可能的
- It's not real.  - Yes, it is.

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,760
好吧... 看 从科学角度来说
Yeah... uh, look. It is scientifically impossible

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,830
一个人不可能推倒一头牛
for a person to tip a cow.

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,660
哪怕你熊腰虎背的
Even you, with your stocky build

6
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:15,630
也没法做到
and lumberjack shoulders, you couldn't do it.

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,460
太残忍了 你干嘛要推倒一头牛?
It's horrible. Why would you push a cow over?

8
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:19,400
它们是神圣的
They're sacred.

9
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,760
够了
Oh, stop it.

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,700
我看你不也吃了上百万个汉堡嘛
I've seen you eat, like, a million hamburgers.

11
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,600
嘿 神圣的动物也可以很好吃啊
Hey, an animal can be both sacred and delicious.

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,460
听着 我说了我就这么干过 好吗?
Look, I'm telling you I've done it, okay?

13
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,130
我记得很清楚那头牛站着
I clearly remember the cow standing up

14
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,660
然后就被我推倒了
and then the cow on its side.

15
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,660
你当时喝醉了吗?
Were you drunk?

16
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,300
我当时在内达华州 只有16岁 你说呢?
I was 16 in Nebraska. What do you think?

17
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,130
我觉得你才是倒地的那个
I think you're the one who fell over.

18
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:44,660
这也就解释了为什么我看天空也倒下了
That would explain why the sky was also on its side.

19
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:45,930
嘿
Hey.

20
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,330
Howard 你说推倒一头牛: 是真是假?
Howard. Cow tipping: real or not?

21
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,730
嗯 我觉得... 是假的
Mmm. I'm gonna say... not.

22
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,860
因为我在我妈打呼噜时
That's just based on me trying to roll

23
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,760
也推不动她
my mom over when she's snoring.

24
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,230
说到那个胖女人
Speaking of that big side of beef,

25
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:02,430
她邀请你们大家感恩节去她家
uh, she's invited all of you to Thanksgiving at her house.

26
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,400
要知道 我听说没有理由地
You know, I've been told that a bald refusal

27
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,660
拒绝邀请很不友好 所以我必须
of an invitation is rude and one must instead

28
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,530
说一个借口以示礼貌...
offer up a polite excuse, so...

29
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,930
我很想去 但不幸的是
I'd love to go, but, unfortunately,

30
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:15,660
那听上去太糟了
that sounds awful.

31
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,260
来吧 会很有趣的
Come on, it'll be fun.

32
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,630
事实上 我们会在这里过感恩节
Uh, we were actually gonna do it here.

33
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:24,430
求你们了 因为Bernadette的妈妈出远门了
Please? Bernadette's bringing her dad

34
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,660
所以她要把爸爸接过来
'cause her mom's out of town,

35
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,660
我跟老头子什么共同语言都没有
and I never have anything to say to that guy.

36
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,960
既然你这么说了 我挺想去的
Oh, since you put it that way, I'd love to go,

37
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,600
但那听上去更糟糕了
but that sounds even more awful.

38
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,300
其实能让Sheldon抱怨别人的厨艺
It'd actually be nice to not hear

39
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,030
而不是我的 这挺好
Sheldon complain about my cooking all day.

40
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,460
你... 不好意思
Yo... uh, excuse me,

41
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,260
但每年你都会做一顿糟糕的饭菜
but every year you prepare a terrible meal

42
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,460
每次我都会批评一番
and every year I criticize it.

43
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,560
我们的传统在你看来就毫无意义吗?
Do our traditions mean nothing to you?

44
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,530
- 我想去  - 我也是
- I want to go.  - Yeah, me, too.

45
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:49,860
- 算我一个  - Sheldon
- I'm in.  - Sheldon.

46
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,300
好吧 我去
Ugh, fine, I'll go.

47
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,700
但如果她做的菜很好吃 那感恩节就毁了
But if her food is delicious, Thanksgiving is ruined,

48
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,730
到时候都赖你
and it's on you.

49

* 宇宙一度又烫又稠密 *
* Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state *

* Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! *

51
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,330
* 地球开始降温 *
* The Earth began to cool *

52

53
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,530
* 我们建长城 我们建金字塔 *

我们真的得去Wolowitz夫人家吗?
Do we really have to go to Mrs. Wolowitz's house?

60
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,400
是的
We do.

61
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,260
我希望你能老老实实的
And I expect you to be on your best behavior.

62
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,330
现在我知道非洲黑奴的心情了
Now I know how the African slaves felt.

63
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:42,650
被迫离开家园 被白人奴役 做苦力活
Being dragged from their homes to labor under the yoke of the white man.

64
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:48,280
你真的要把去Wolowitz妈妈家吃感恩节晚餐这事
Are you honestly comparing Thanksgiving dinner at Wolowitz's mom's

65
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,300
跟人类史上最悲惨的惨剧之一比较吗?
with one of the greatest tragedies in the history of mankind?

66
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,290
是的
Yes.

67
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:58,590
Sheldon 其实去哪儿过感恩节都很开心的 我上次去拉斯维加斯就是
Sheldon, you can have a nice Thanksgiving anywhere. I spent one in Vegas.

68
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:58,980
你去过?
You did?

69
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,640
当然 那还是我跟Zack在一起的时候
Yeah, back when I was dating Zack.

70
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,280
Zack其实比我想象的更有趣
Zack was actually more fun than I thought.

71
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,560
我们去赌博 去了某个廉价的婚礼教堂
We gambled, we went to one of those cheesy wedding chapels,

72
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,860
还吃了顿可口的火鸡大餐
we had a really good turkey dinner.

73
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,860
这有点奇怪 我们当时毕竟是在脱衣舞厅呢
which was surprising, since we were at a strip club.

74
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:12,900
等下 你去了教堂?
Wait, you went to a chape?

75
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,260
是啊 怎么了?
Yeah. Why?

76
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,000
我们办了一场假婚礼
We had one of those silly fake weddings.

77
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,100
呃 Penny...
Penny...

78
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,400
你知道那是真的吧?
you know those are real, right?

79
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,700
才不是 那是闹着玩的
No, they're not.

80
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:28,830
不 是真的
Yeah, they are.

81
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,000
不是啊
No, they're not.

82
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,730
就是真的
Yeah, they are.

83
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,200
- 他说得对  - 婚礼是真的
- He's right.  - They're real.

84
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,800
但是... 看起来不像啊
But it... didn't seem real.

85
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,330
我来问你
Let me ask you a question.

86
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:47,460
你当时有没有觉得 拉斯维加斯是倒着的?
At any point, was Las Vegas on its side?

87
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,300
嗨 老爸
Hi, Dad.

88
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,500
嗨 宝贝
Hi, honey.

89
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
哦 你还给大家买了啤酒
Oh, you brought beer for everybody.

90
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,300
呃 好吧 是给大家买的
Uh, okay, yeah, it's for everybody.

91
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,100
我其实真的只想安安静静地待在家里
I really just wanted to have a nice, quiet day at home

92
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,500
看看球赛
and watch the game.

93
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,000
你在这里也可以安安静静地看球赛啊
You can have a quiet day and watch the game here.

94
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,300
Howard 这药不管用!
Howard, the medicine's not working!

95
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,500
你只管吃就好了
You just took it.

96
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,860
至少让它进到你胃里!
At least let it reach your first stomach!

97
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,730
嗨 Mike
Hey, Mike.

98
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,060
我帮你拿吧
Let me help you out, there.

99
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,130
谢了 你妈妈怎么了?
Thanks. What's wrong with your mom?

100
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:29,560
哦 她痛风又发作了
Oh, her gout's flaring up.

101
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,460
这就证明一天一个苹果派可没法保持健康
Turns out an apple pie a day does not keep the doctor away.

102
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,260
我的小脚趾怎么会这么疼?
How can one little toe hurt so bad?

103
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:42,430
大概是被你全身的重量压的!
Maybe because that little piggy is being crushed by the barn!

104
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,830
她应该很快就会安静下来
She should quiet down soon.

105
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,660
我给她的止痛药都能让牛... 呃她倒了
I gave her enough pain meds to choke a... well, her.

106
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,300
我们一起做饭吧
I guess we're gonna have to do all the cooking.

107
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,560
我倒有个主意
I have a better idea.

108
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,900
你想都别想
If you think you're gonna make me

109
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,230
让我一个人做饭
do all this by myself, you're crazy.

110
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,160
我是打算让Raj一个人做饭的
I was gonna make Raj do it all by himself.

111
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,400
哦 确实是个好主意
Oh, well, that's a great idea.

112
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,560
车这么少 一路畅通啊
No traffic, we're sailing.

113
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,700
是啊
Yes.

114
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,360
就像在船上一样
Like we're on a ship.

115
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,100
从非洲开到美洲的船上
Coming from Africa to America.

116
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:17,230
Sheldon 这样做不好
Sheldon, that's completely inappropriate.

117
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:19,930
别总把自己比作奴隶
You can't keep comparing yourself to a slave.

118
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,630
遵命 Amy小姐
Yes, Miss Amy.

119
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,760
真不敢相信你和那个白痴结婚了
I can't believe you're married to that idiot.

120
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,260
呃 你能不能不说了? 我们是闹着玩的
Ugh, would you stop? We just did it as a goof.

121
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,860
不管是不是闹着玩的 你都已经结婚了!
Well, a goof or not, you're actually married.

122
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,600
你得想办法解决这件事
You need to get this taken care of.

123
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,030
我会的 你干嘛这么纠结这件事?
I will. Why are you making this such a big deal?

124
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,230
哦 哦 我知道原因
Oh, oh, oh, I have a reason.

125
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:41,200
没准是因为你同意嫁给Zack
It could be because you said yes to marrying Zack,

126
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,730
可是每次Leonard求婚的时候
but every time Leonard's proposed,

127
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,060
你都坚决反对
he's gotten a resounding no.

128
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:49,400
真的 我真的是这么想的
Yeah, that's just off the top of my head.

129
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,330
我要怎么办?
So how do I undo this?

130
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,830
你最好能和他离婚
I'm hoping you can get an annulment.

131
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,300
就像从没发生过一样
It's just like it never happened.

132
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,060
好啊 我要做什么?
Great, well, what do I have to do?

133
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,730
这上面说你只能在以下情况下
It says here you can get an annulment

134
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,500
解除婚姻关系
if any of the following conditions are met.

135
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,460
"你是否无法过上幸福的婚姻生活?"
"Were you unable to consummate the marriage?"

136
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,260
Penny? 还是看一下条吧
Penny? Next.

137
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,860
"有没有任何证据能证明婚姻关系中存在 
"Is there any evidence of fraud, bigamy,

138
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,460
欺骗 重婚 或缺乏了解?"
want of understanding?"

139
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,500
"缺乏了解?"
"Want of understanding?"

140
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,630
那是什么意思?
What does that even mean?

141
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,460
叮咚 就这条了
Ding, ding, ding. We have a winner.

142
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,330
谢谢你今天来帮忙
Thanks for saving the day.

143
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:18,460
不用客气
Ah, no problem.

144
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,660
没有印度人(印第安人)做饭的感恩节
It wouldn't be Thanksgiving

145
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,660
不叫感恩节
without an Indian providing the food.

146
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,830
你妈把黄油罐头放哪?
Uh, now, where does your mom keep the Crisco?

147
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:27,900
我不知道
Um, I don't know.

148
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,630
可能在她脸上的那坨肉里
Probably in a wad in her cheek.

149
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,300
我在这帮Raj 你为什么不去陪陪我爸呢?
I'll help Raj in here. Why don't you go keep my dad company?

150
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,660
他不想让我陪他 我是个跟他女儿上床的
Oh, he doesn't want me in there. I'm the creepy little guy

151
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,830
猥琐矮子
who has sex with his daughter.

152
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,560
- 别傻了 他很爱你  - 是吗?
- Don't be silly, he loves you.  - Does he?

153
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,160
- 好吧 但他很关心你  - 真的吗?
- Okay, he cares about you a lot.  - Really?

154
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,060
我总给你收拾烂摊子 赶紧给我过去
I do crap for you all the time. Get out there.

155
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:58,600
你妻子跟孙子孙女在亚利桑那州是吧?
So your wife's in Arizona with the grandkids?

156
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,160
啊
Uh-huh.

157
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,900
其实 我妈也去过... 亚利桑那州
You know, my mom's been to... Arizona.

158
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,660
她骑着骡子去了大峡谷
She rode one of those mules down in the Grand Canyon.

159
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,060
长话短说 他们不得不毙了那头骡子
Long story short, they had to shoot it.

160
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,530
因为她很肥
'Cause she's so fat.

161
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,460
我去开门 你接着笑
I'll get the door while you finish laughing.

162
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,400
嗨 小伙伴们
Hey, guys.

163
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,430
感恩节快乐
Happy Thanksgiving.

164
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,030
闻起来真香啊
It smells wonderful.

165
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:33,300
有没有人在厨房里干苦工啊?
Is anyone slaving away in the kitchen?

166
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,560
- 因为我也知道这滋味...  - Sheldon
- Because I, too, know...  - Sheldon.

167
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,860
给你 谢谢你让我们来吃饭
Here. Thank you for having us.

168
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,900
你什么情况?
What's with you?

169
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,100
她生我的气
Oh, she's mad at me

170
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,430
因为她刚发现她跟Zack结婚了
because she just found out she's married to Zack.

171
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,460
真的吗?
Really?

172
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,500
她之前交的那个笨蛋男朋友?
That dumb-ass she used to date?

173
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,060
实在太招笑了
That's hysterical.

174
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,360
我真不该为在车里开了这瓶酒而自责
I can't believe I felt bad for opening this in the car.

175
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,530
你需要帮忙吗?
You need any help?

176
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:02,230
需要 你能帮我把那个调味汁瓶够下来吗?
Uh, yeah, can you, uh, reach that, uh, gravy boat up there?

177
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,560
- 好  - 太棒了
- Uh, sure.  - Great.

178
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,700
终于有个人能够着了
That makes one of you.

179
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,660
好 我们在很短的时间内要做很多事
Okay, we have a lot to do and not much time to do it.

180
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,260
Bernadette 你负责玉米 调味汁和山药
Bernadette, you're on corn, gravy and yam detail.

181
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,660
Amy 你负责面包卷 越桔
Amy, you're on rolls, cranberries

182
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,800
还要保证Bernadette离棉花糖远远的
and making sure Bernadette stays away from the marshmallows.

183
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,400
没错 我看见你偷吃了
That's right, I see you.

184
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,400
好 如果你们有什么问题
Okay, if you have any questions,

185
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,060
我就在这脚打后脑勺地干活
I'll be over here basting my ass off.

186
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,160
集中精力是关键
Focus is key.

187
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,860
你们知道Penny跟Zack三年前结婚了吗?
Did you guys know Penny married Zack three years ago?

188
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,460
什么? 什么...?
What? Wha...?

189
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,600
你玩过橄榄球吗?
You ever play football?

190
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,200
在大学里玩过
A little in college.

191
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,230
你呢?
You?

192
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,430
没踢过
No.

193
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:45,030
但我在走廊里被撞过一次
But I did get tackled in the hallway once.

194
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,600
整个学校都雀跃了
The whole school cheered.

195
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,860
我找到了你跟Zack需要填的
Hey, I found the, uh, court papers

196
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,430
法律文件
that you and Zack need to fill out.

197
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:57,030
- 回家之后我就把它们打出来  - 行
- I'll print them when we get home.  - Fine.

198
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,230
然后我们就把这篇翻过去
And we can just put this whole thing behind us.

199
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,300
你够了没?
Are you done?

200
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,060
- 怎么了?  - 我知道 我搞砸了
- What?  - Look, I get it, I screwed up.

201
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,730
但我们这一天都要谈这个事吗?
Is this all we're gonna talk about the rest of the day?

202
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,100
你为什么跟我生气?
Why are you mad at me?

203
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,830
干了蠢事的那个人是你
You're the one that did the stupid thing.

204
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,300
- 我只是在挽救  - 啊!
- I'm just trying to fix it.  - Ugh!

205
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,700
我需要新鲜空气
I need some air.

206
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,330
但... Penny
Well... Penny.

207
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,130
虽然我一点也不了解女人
Now, I don't know the first thing about women,

208
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,830
但我绝对不会追出去
but I would not follow her.

209
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,640
好好看比赛
Listen the stretch.

210
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,630
我怎么成坏人了?
How am I the bad guy?

211
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:34,400
她是那个跟别人结婚的人 我是受害者
She's the one who married someone else. I'm the victim.

212
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,860
听起来Zack才是受害者 你在睡他媳妇呢
Sounds like Zack's the victim. You're sleeping with his wife.

213
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:43,060
我跟我的老太婆已经结婚35年了
I've kept my marriage together for 35 years.

214
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,560
所以我能插一句吗?
Can I weigh in here?

215
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,730
当然
Sure.

216
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,600
我想好好看比赛啊 闭嘴
I'm trying to watch the game. Shut up.

217
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,830
喔!
Oh!

218
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:53,830
你们这群人是怎么把首攻给搞砸的啊? 
How do you not make a first down there?

219
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,560
他们想要冲出五人防守阵势
They passed against a nickel defense.

220
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,160
但是他们应该用离铲球策略才对
They should have run it off-tackle.

221
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,930
天呐 你是怎么知道这些的?
How the hell do you know that?

222
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,560
我爸爸喜欢橄榄球
My father loved football.

223
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,400
他过去经常逼我看比赛
He always made me watch it

224
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,200
然后他才允许我去做作业
before I was allowed to do my homework.

225
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,160
好了 这下你开心了
Well, you'll be happy

226
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,699
我已经跟Zack通过话了
to know I just spoke to Zack

227
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,330
他愿意在协议书上签字
and he's willing to sign the court papers.

228
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,630
他正在过来的路上
He's on his way here now.

229
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:16,530
- 等等 你把他请到这里来了?  - 是啊
- Wait, you invited him here?  - Yeah.

230
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:18,230
我准备要再插一句了
I'm getting ready to weigh in again.

231
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,800
过来
Come on.

232
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,700
你认为现在他们该怎么做?
What do you think they ought to do now?

233
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,000
我会让外接员快速斜角跑来应接传球员
I would throw a quick slant to a wideout,

234
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,430
因为防守方准备向传球员发动突然袭击
given that the defense is showing blitz.

235
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:31,400
喔 我可喜欢吃薄煎饼了 特别是蘸了酸奶的那种 
Oh, I love a good blitz, especially with sour cream.

236
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:31,400
{\an8}(blitz音似blintz 一种煎饼)

237
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,860
听懂没?
Get it?

238
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,130
因为这两个词听起来很像
'Cause it sounds like "blintz."

239
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,400
是不是有人说煎饼了?!
Did someone say "blintz"?!

240
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,860
我就是不明白
I just don't understand

241
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,330
为什么你要请他今天到这里来
why you invited him here today.

242
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,400
那是因为你不停地说这件事
Because you wouldn't shut up about it.

243
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,860
我给他打电话的时候 他没什么事可干
When I called him, he had nothing to do,

244
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,960
所以我就想啊 过来也挺...
so I just thought it would...

245
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,760
嗨 伙计们 我在这辛苦地准备大餐啊
Hey, guys, I'm trying to cook in here.

246
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,030
喔 不好意思 我们声音会小一点
Oh, sorry. We'll keep it down.

247
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:54,860
不 不 大声点
No, no, speak up.

248
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,330
我马上要用搅拌机了
I'm about to use the blender,

249
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:57,930
我怕听漏了什么
and I don't want to miss anything.

250
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:01,030
好吧 你可能要多准备一人份了
Well, you might have to cook for one more

251
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,230
因为她请了Zack过来
because she invited Zack.

252
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,860
- 不是吧?  - 喔!
- What?  - Ooh!

253
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:07,000
我的天啊 我的天啊
My, my.

254
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,460
故事的情节 就想我的肉汁一样 越发变成一团糊糊了
The plot, like my gravy, thickens.

255
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,330
我真不喜欢你妈妈的厕所
I don't care for your mother's bathroom.

256
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,400
不管我站在那个角度办事
There's not an angle to do one's business

257
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,860
都有一个小丑的塑像在盯着我看
without a clown figurine staring at you.

258
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,800
所以我坐着办事啊
That's why I sit.

259
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,060
啊 原来如此
Yeah, that's why.

260
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,530
你记得感恩节的那场
You remember the Thanksgiving game

261
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:34,560
在下雪的达拉斯举行的比赛吗?
when it snowed in Dallas?

262
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,160
那是1993年 Leon Lett在比赛的最后关头搞砸了
1993. Leon Lett blew the game in the final seconds

263
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,130
结果Dolphins赢得了胜利
and the Dolphins emerged victorious.

264
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:43,100
然后我终于能开始写微积分作业了
Then I finally got to do my calculus.

265
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,600
我那时候太生气了 都想把电视机给砸了
I was so pissed, I wanted to shoot my TV.

266
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,460
我爸也这么想
So was my dad.

267
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,660
然后他确实把电视机砸了
And then he did.

268
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,630
- 有没有人想要啤酒?  - 我 
- Anyone need a beer?  - Yeah.

269
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,030
感谢上帝
Thank God.

270
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,960
那现在 你父亲还住在德州吗?
So, does your dad still live in Texas?

271
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,460
不了 他在我14岁的时候去世了
No. He died when I was 14.

272
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,760
真遗憾
I'm sorry to hear that.

273
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,330
我们那卖酒的人也是这么觉得的
So was the man who owned the local liquor store.

274
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:10,830
他哭的不行
He cried and cried.

275
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,560
给你
Here you go.

276
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,660
喔 谢谢
Oh, thanks.

277
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,500
所以 你父亲在你14岁的时候就去世了
So, if your dad died when you were 14,

278
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,560
你从来没有机会跟他好好喝一杯吧
you were never old enough to have a beer with the man.

279
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,960
没有
No, sir.

280
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,830
他确实想要在我的高中毕业典礼上跟我喝一杯
He did try to give me one for my high school graduation,

281
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:28,060
但是那个时候我只有11岁 我妈不让我喝酒
but I was 11 and my mom said no.

282
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,560
那么 你今天就跟我喝一杯吧
Well, you're having one with me.

283
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,930
好啊
All right.

284
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,230
敬你的父亲
To your dad.

285
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,800
我也没机会和我爸共饮啤酒
I never had a beer with my dad, either.

286
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:58,800
别捣乱 我们这儿正开心着呢
Do you mind? We're having a moment here.

287
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,930
我真不相信Penny嫁给Zack了
I can't believe Penny's married to Zack.

288
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,660
不知道看上那家伙哪点了
Wonder what she saw in that guy.

289
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,160
不知道
I don't know.

290
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,130
他很温柔 又高大 很帅气
He's sweet, he's tall, handsome.

291
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:16,100
肩膀宽阔 头发也不错
Broad shoulders, good hair.

292
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,460
那她看上Leonard哪点了呢
Hmm. Wonder what she sees in Leonard.

293
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,200
外面如何?
How's it going out there?

294
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,930
Sheldon和你爸爸很合得来 完全把我无视了
Sheldon and your dad are bonding and completely ignoring me.

295
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:29,030
我了解你此刻的想法
I know how you feel.

296
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:32,700
当Sheildon买了那台自动吸尘器 一个星期没理过我
Sheldon ignored me for a week when he got that Roomba vacuum.

297
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,430
我趁他不注意把那玩意弄坏了
I kick it when he's not looking.

298
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,030
他们在干嘛?
What are they doing?

299
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:42,860
喝着啤酒 看着球赛
They're drinking beer and watching football.

300
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,400
那你为啥不去加入他们呢?
So, why don't you do that with them?

301
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,730
他们不想我在那儿
They don't want me.

302
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:46,900
什么意思?
What do you mean?

303
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,400
Sheldon说他的父亲
Well, Sheldon started talking

304
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,660
已经不在人世
about how his dad isn't alive anymore,

305
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,030
然后他们在喝酒 然后我就
and they were toasting, and I tried

306
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,530
说我有多悲伤
to tell them about how sad I was

307
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:54,760
被我爸抛弃...
when my dad abandoned...

308
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,530
Zack来了!
Zack's here!

309
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,700
搅拌肉酱
Stir the gravy.

310
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,330
抱歉 我虽然很想继续听你说
Sorry. I really want to hear how sad you are.

311
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:05,530
等我5 哦 不 等我10分钟
I'll be back in like five, ten minutes.

312
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,300
真不好意思耽误你放假的日子过来
Sorry she made you come over here on a holiday.

313
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,400
没关系 反正我也没啥事
It's all right. I didn't have anything going on.

314
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,000
而且 Penny刚告诉我说我们结婚了
Plus, Penny told me we're married,

315
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,400
而且感恩节就是家人团聚的时候
and Thanksgiving's a time to be with family.

316
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,360
好吧 很好
Yeah, okay, great.

317
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,630
我们能不能赶快了结这事儿?
Can we just get this over with?

318
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:24,600
好吧 你们必须在这儿签字
Yeah, uh, you guys have to sign here and here.

319
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,360
星期一 就去离婚登记
On Monday, we'll file for the annulment,

320
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,100
这场"婚姻"就结束了
and this "marriage" will be over.

321
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,560
好
Okay.

322
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,030
我觉得我不太想签
I don't know if I want to sign it.

323
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:34,030
哦 哦 哦
Ooh. Ooh. Ooh.

324
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,630
为什么你不签字?
Why won't you sign it?

325
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:41,160
我想 如果我们离婚 对孩子很不好
I just think splitting up can be rough on kids.

326
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,560
我们没有孩子
We don't have any kids.

327
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,100
确定吗? 因为直到今早
Are you sure? 'Cause you didn't know

328
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,700
你才直到我们结婚
we were married until this morning.

329
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,600
好吧 Zack 别这样
Okay, look, Zack, come on.

330
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,730
咱都不认为那场婚礼是认真的
You know neither of us thought this was real.

331
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:55,660
主婚的可是个扮猫王的人啊
I mean, we were married by an Elvis impersonator.

332
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,200
当然是个扮演者
Of course it was an impersonator.

333
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,700
我们雇不起猫王啊
We could never afford a real Elvis.

334
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:04,530
你嫁他不嫁我?
You married him instead of me?

335
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,330
很明智
Good call.

336
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:07,930
签了它
Sign the papers.

337
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:09,230
等下 你知道吗?
Hang on. You know what?

338
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:11,100
你今天一直很刻薄
You have been a jerk about this all day.

339
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,630
每次你都这样... 每次当我搞砸了
You always do this... whenever I mess up,

340
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,600
你都大加嘲讽 让我更加不爽了
you're right there to make me feel even worse about it.

341
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,700
不是这样啊
That is not true.

342
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,960
是啊 我们本可以等到星期一
Yeah, we could've waited till Monday,

343
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,500
再签这玩意 这就很简单了啊
signed the papers, this all would have been over.

344
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,000
可是你请他过来的
You're the one who invited him here.

345
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,600
好吧 你又来了... 又在指责
Oh, there you go again... just another mistake

346
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,600
我的过错
you're throwing in my face.

347
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,200
这可不好 老兄
Not cool, bro.

348
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,700
我开始觉得
I'm starting to think

349
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,100
你并不适合和我老婆约会
you're not the kind of guy I want dating my wife.

350
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,100
好吧
Yeah, well,

351
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,600
她很快就不是你的老婆了
she's not gonna be your wife for long.

352
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,400
哦不 你快死了?
Oh, no. Are you dying?

353
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,460
快了 你快签吧
I'm about to. Sign the paper.

354
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:47,160
知道吗 "老婆好才是真的好"
Know what they say: "Happy wife, happy life."

355
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,930
我们开吃吧
Let's eat.

356
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:58,200
二 三 八 四 六
Two, three, eight, four, six.

357
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,160
不吐的话 这是我的极限了
That's all I can do without throwing up.

358
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,430
我可不这么想
That is not what I expected

359
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:09,200
你不是说你要把"圆周率"嗝一遍吗
when you said you were gonna burp "pie."

360
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,160
有人说有"馅饼"吃吗?!
Did somebody say "pie"?!

361
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,160
{\an8}(馅饼和圆周率都读pie)

362
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,860
我分不清哪个更吓人
I don't know what's scarier

363
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,430
是那个浴室的小丑
the bathroom clowns

364
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:20,030
还是那个老女人
or the woman that put them there.

365
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:24,900
我只知道 车里只能塞进她一个人
All I know is you can only fit one of her in a car.

366
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,760
这就是她生出来的小丑
And there's the clown that came out of her.

367
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:37,200
我本来不愿意来的
I really didn't want to come here,

368
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,200
但我现在觉得
but this is shaping up to be

369
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,630
这是长久以来我过得最好的感恩节
one of the best Thanksgivings I've had in a long time.

370
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:44,000
我也是
Me, too.

371
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,930
嘿 Howie说你们俩嘲笑了他一天了!
Hey. Howie says you've been making fun of him all day!

372
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:48,130
你们快给他道歉
Now, both of you apologize

373
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,660
立刻马上!
right now!

374
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,700
她那么小只
She's so tiny.

375
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:58,730
发起脾气来真有意思
It's funny when she's mad.

376
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,730
好了 先生们
All right, mister, I think you owe

377
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:06,360
你们应该向Howard和Bernadette说声对不起
Howard and Bernadette an apology.

378
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,630
好吧 你说得对
Perhaps you're right.

379
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,160
我很抱歉
I'm sorry for my behavior.

380
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,260
我喝高了
I've had alcohol, and it's caused me

381
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,600
所以做了出格的事情
to be inappropriate.

382
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,500
- 没关系  - 别放在心上
- It's okay.  - Don't worry about it.

383
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,430
谢谢
Thank you.

384
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:21,900
她很棒 是吧?
Ain't she great?

385
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,060
嗯
Mmm.

386
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,400
Sheldon 别这样
Sheldon.

387
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,160
给我们拿点酒来 怎么样?
Now, how's about you get us a couple of beers?

388
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,100
谢谢你做了这么好吃的食物
Thanks again for cooking.

389
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,560
是啊 很美味
Yeah, everything was delicious.

390
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,730
如果没有这两位女士的帮助
Well, I couldn't

391
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:50,000
我是做不出来这些美味的
have done it without my two favorite girls.

392
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
哦
Aw.

393
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,130
她们是玛莎·斯图尔特和瑞秋·雷(都是美食节目女主持)
Martha Stewart and Rachael Ray.

394
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:59,730
嘿 Sheldon 我们出去
Hey, Sheldon, what do you say we go outside

395
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:01,660
扔球玩怎么样?
and throw around the old pigskin?

396
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:01,660
{\an8}(橄榄球的俚语 直译为猪皮)

397
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,630
这里是犹太家庭
This is a Jewish house.

398
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:06,260
他们没有猪皮的
I don't think they have pigskin.

399
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:11,660
有人说"猪皮"了?!
Did someone say "pigskin"?!

400
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,330
亲爱的 今天真是抱歉
Hey, honey, I'm sorry about today.

401
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,400
我答应你 下次如果我结婚了
And I promise, next time I get married,

402
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,000
肯定不是玩笑
it won't be a joke.

403
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,560
是为了爱情
It'll be for love.

404
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,560
或者为了钱
Or money.

405
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,100
我也有错
I'm sorry, too.

406
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,560
你没有
Don't be.

407
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,530
都是我的错
It's my fault.

408
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:30,830
我是个不合格的丈夫
I was a terrible husband.

409
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,130
一直不在你身边
