00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:15,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look out!

52
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I checked it a couple minutes ago. - What do you mean?

53
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Puppy Paws!

54
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:31,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Son, I am very disappointed in you.

55
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:35,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You disrupted the workshop and wasted a whole day of work.

56
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:39,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The elves are very upset. They're now another day behind schedule.

57
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:42,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know how hard they work getting ready.

58
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't realize it would cause such havoc.

59
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just wanted to have some fun.

60
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:50,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe you should be thinking about how important Christmas is

61
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to children and puppies all around the world.

62
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:56,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's our responsibility to deliver good puppies the gift

63
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they've wished for the entire year.

64
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You mean it's your responsibility.

65
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just want to be an ordinary puppy.

66
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're grounded until further notice.

67
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:08,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That means no playing fetch with the elves

68
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and no flying with the reindeer.

69
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:12,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wish Christmas would just go away.

70
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:15,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Puppy Paws! What a horrible thing to say!

71
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you think I was too strict with him?

72
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe just a smidgen, but...

73
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...I'm sure he'll get over it.

74
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Puppy Paws has to understand,

75
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he's the future of Christmas.

76
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:34,110


77
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:36,670


78
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You pups want to sing along?

79
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yo, I don't sing. I rap.

80
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why do we even have to come here?

81
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a Christmas tradition.

82
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've been watching the lighting of the tree since I was a pup like you Buddies.

83
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:07,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're quiet this evening, Budderball.

84
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hadn't even heard your stomach grumble.

85
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anything the matter?

86
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm still in the doghouse for eating the Thanksgiving turkey.

87
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:18,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you worried you might be on Santa Paws' naughty list?

88
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:22,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Santa Paws is just Dad dressed up in a red and white suit.

89
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:26,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's all, dawg. They just use it so we behave all year.

90
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that right, B-Dawg?

91
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's look at the evidence, Deputy Sniffer.

92
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:34,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If the jolly dude came down the chimney, wouldn't there be a lot of soot?

93
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:37,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not really buying the whole ''Santa Paws'' thing, either,

94
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:40,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I sure do love all the presents.

95
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your material desires are those of the wanting mind.

96
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Enough is never enough.

97
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buddha's right, Buddies.

98
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Getting material things isn't what Christmas is all about.

99
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:54,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Christmas spirit is about the unselfish spreading of love and kindness.

100
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There are plenty of lonely puppies

101
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}without families or children to love them.

102
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:11,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello, everybody. Thank you for coming down to the annual lighting

103
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}of the Fernfield Christmas tree.

104
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not quite the turnout we expected.

105
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Three...

106
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:25,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...two... one!

107
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:38,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buddies, it's Mr. Cruge, the dog catcher.

108
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,070


109
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:52,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's probably just a faulty bulb.

110
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:21,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my!

111
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:24,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you, Lord, for this blessing. Amen.

112
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thought you could run wild in the streets?

113
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not on my watch you don't.

114
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:34,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't wanna be responsible for Christmas.

115
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just wanna be an ordinary puppy.

00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For a minute there I thought I might have to push.

225
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:05,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What's wrong with the truck? - Almost ran out of power.

226
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's all the mail, sir?

227
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's all there was.

228
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,690


229
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:23,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sweet mama! Gingerbread cookies!

230
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:27,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Budderball? Is it really you?

231
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:30,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've been looking for you all over town.

232
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:32,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That polar bear cub sure looks realistic.

233
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:35,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His mouth even moves.

234
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, big fella!

235
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Budderball! Wait!

236
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good boy.

237
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:48,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my!

238
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. I've just got...

239
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:02,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK... Just a little knot here.

240
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What in tarnation?

241
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:15,020


242
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:17,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me?

243
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me!

244
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:25,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, hello there, young'un.

245
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Deputy Sniffer at your service.

246
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:30,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm looking for a pup I just saw.

247
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:32,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But then he disappeared. His name is Budderball.

248
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I've known that pup his whole life.

249
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:36,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you know where he lives?

250
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:39,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Budderball lives at Livingston Manor.

251
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:42,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now to get there you want to go left down Main Street,

252
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:46,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then take a right at the candy store and keep going.

253
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's on the outskirts of town. You can't miss it.

254
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:51,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks, Deputy.

255
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:56,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK, heads up, I'm sending it down.

256
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks, Budderball.

257
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Got it.

258
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:13,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This must be it.

259
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think we got some in the van.

260
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, there's a box right there. I'll grab 'em.

261
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:27,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here you go!

262
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:33,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll send them up.

263
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:37,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- A bit heavy. - OK, I got it.

264
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:39,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK. You sure?

265
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:50,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I think we

266
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:52,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}are just about done.

267
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:55,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think we should lower the candy canes a little.

268
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're kinda hard to... see.

269
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:04,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, that's heavy.

270
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:06,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Off we go.

271
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Budderball.

272
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:20,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, sweet mama.

273
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not sure how Dad does this,

274
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:39,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but here goes nothing.

275
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:50,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey! Do you mind getting off me?

276
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:53,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's you, right? Budderball?

277
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I finally found you!

278
00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:01,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who do you think you are rolling out of my chimney and busting my candy cane?

279
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm Puppy Paws. Pleased to meet you.

280
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:05,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Where do you come from? - The North Pole.

281
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:08,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah. I bet you belong to Santa Claus.

282
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:10,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, technically, yes.

283
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:12,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But Santa Paws is my pa.

284
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:17,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, right. You expect me to believe that your dad is Santa Paws?

285
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:18,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why wouldn't you?

286
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who put you up to this?

287
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No one. I was checking the naughty list and you looked like fun.

288
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:26,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What'd you say? I'm on the naughty list?!

289
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was just a little turkey!

290
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:31,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry, you can get off the naughty list and onto the nice list

291
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:33,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}by doing good deeds for others.

292
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Like? - Well...

293
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like teaching me how to be an ordinary pup.

294
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK, well, I'll show you what I like to do.

295
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:51,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the most magical room in the house.

296
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:53,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What kind of toys do you make here?

297
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They don't make toys, they make food.

298
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:57,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The most delicious food around.

299
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:00,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like roast beef sandwiches, chicken wings, chili dogs...

300
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is he one of your elves?

301
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:05,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're a real joker, aren't you? That's the chef.

302
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What's he doing? - Making cookies.

303
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:09,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But we can't eat them, they're for Christmas.

304
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:19,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, how'd you get up there?

305
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bad idea.

306
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Wow! - What?

307
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:39,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Those cookies. They just changed. How did you do that?

308
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:42,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's no biggie. Christmas magic is stored in here.

309
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I can do stuff like my dad.

310
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:46,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I can't quite control it.

311
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, you want a cookie?

312
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you remember? I'm trying to get back on the nice list.

313
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, suit yourself.

314
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:05,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Be good, Budderball, be good. Don't eat the cookies!

315
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no!

316
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:13,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My compliments to the chef.

317
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:19,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I believe it's time for lunch, Budder...

318
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...ball.

319
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah, laugh it up.

320
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:39,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now I'm going to be late meeting my brothers and sis in the park!

321
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:41,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How about you introduce me to them?

322
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:45,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Once I get done with my timeout, I'd be happy to get you out of my fur!

323
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:47,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks! You're the best!

324
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:51,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is Budderball fashionably late again?

325
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:53,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hope the dude's not in trouble.

326
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:56,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll meditate and send him some positive energy.

327
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's the white, fluffy dude Budderball's with?

328
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Puppy Paws, these are the Buddies.

329
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The mucky pup is Mudbud.

330
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:12,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The blinged-out one is B-Dawg.

331
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:14,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buddha looks like he's sleeping,

332
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but he calls it meditation.

333
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:18,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And Rosebud is our little sis.

334
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But don't let the pink bow fool you.

335
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's feistier than she looks.

336
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:23,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And this is Puppy Paws.

337
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:26,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He claims to be Santa Paws' son from the North Pole.

338
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:29,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yo, you straight up trippin'?

340
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry about my brother.

341
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've just grown a little skeptical about Christmas.

342
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:40,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not alone. No one believes in Christmas spirit anymore.

343
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:43,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's why I'm here. To learn how to be an ordinary pup.

344
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, you found the right dog to school you.

349

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for the B-Dawg Nation.

354
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Way to break those moves.

374
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dude, can I give it a roll?

375

378
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:12,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Strictly off limits.

379
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:20,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dude! Is it normal for mud to feel itchy?

380

387
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,670

388
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:13,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've gotta hang with Puppy Paws now.

389
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:16,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have to wear this clean coat as punishment.

390

392
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,450

393
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,160

394
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've never had a sis before.

395

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or a brother. This is gonna be epic!

396
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:37,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rosebud! Where are you?

397

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, what do you think?

402
00:32:57,930 --> 00:32:59,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're right. What was I thinking?

403
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Accessories! Hang on. I'll be right back.

404
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:05,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's taking so long?

405
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You startled me.

406
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:19,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That's your new Christmas look? - You don't like it?

407
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:20,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think it's totally fetch.

408
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:23,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I like it, but it's not very Christmassy.

409
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:25,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What could be more Christmassy than this?

410
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me!

411
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rosebud sent me.

412
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:46,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She was, like, totally freaking out about her Christmas makeover.

413
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:48,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, it's time for meditation.

414
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:53,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This Buddha statue came from the Ming Dynasty,

415
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:54,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}over 600 years old.

416
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Very sacred.

417
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:59,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, like, how do we do this ''meditate'' stuff?

418
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:00,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We simply sit and breathe.

419
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:04,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A clear mind is developed through meditation.

420
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:19,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My Buddha statue!

421
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:22,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a snowman, very Zen in the North Pole.

422
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:43,190


423
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

424
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anyone here?

425
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:04,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes?

426
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:06,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi.

427
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My son would like a puppy for Christmas.

428
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:13,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, then, you've come to the right place.

429
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Quiet!

430
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:26,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Where are the puppies? - They're hiding.

431
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:29,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They'll come out if they know what's good for them.

432
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:35,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the one.

433
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's perfect. I'll take her.

434
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's $300.

435
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:43,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought the puppies were free for adoption. We'll give her a loving home.

436
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:45,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Take good care of her. - You're wasting your breath.

437
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:48,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That doesn't matter to me. I want the $300.

438
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:51,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's for my son for Christmas. He's sick.

439
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:56,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A puppy might be just what he needs to brighten his spirits.

440
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:59,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have $50.

441
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No money, no mutt.

442
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:09,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you can find it in your heart...

443
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:26,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dudes, where's Buddha?

444
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:27,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buddha's always on time,

445
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}whereas I'm only on time at dinnertime.

446
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:31,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I sent Puppy Paws over to Buddha's.

447
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:35,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought he might be the only one with the patience to handle him.

448
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:38,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That ''being one with the universe'' stuff...

449
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So powerful.

450
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:43,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And being present, not just giving presents, is so Zen.

451
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:46,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- So, how'd it go? - I lost it.

452
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's the ''it,'' Zen Master?

453
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My temper! That's the ''it'' I lost, OK?

454
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:54,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, I know something that ordinary puppies always do.

455
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Play Hide-and-Go-Seek. - Hide-and-Go-Seek? What's that?

456
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You close your eyes and count down from 1 2 while we hide.

457
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:03,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When you finish counting, you yell really loud,

458
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:05,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}''Ready or not, here I come!''

459
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:07,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you start looking for us, got it?

460
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yo, BFFing dudes,

461
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that sounds like mad, gnarly fun for shizzle! Namaste.

462
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:16,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, brother.

463
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:19,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Twelve drummers drumming, eleven pipers piping...

464
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:23,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everyone go in separate directions and meet behind the stump.

465
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:27,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eight maids a-milking, seven swans a-swimming.

466
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:30,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Six geese a-laying, five golden rings.

467
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:38,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two turtle doves,

468
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:40,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and a partridge in a pear tree.

469
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:41,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's twelve!

470
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:44,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here I come!

471
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:47,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I called you to this stump meeting to discuss Puppy Paws

472
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:49,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and what we are going to do with him.

473
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This game isn't so hard.

474
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:03,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Puppy Paws actually thinks that I'm buying that his pop is Santa.

475
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not even shopping, yo.

476
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:09,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That dude got me in some serious doo-doo.

477
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:13,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I had the humiliation of wearing a clean coat for the entire day.

478
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:15,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If he's Santa Paws' son,

479
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:19,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}why'd he get me in more trouble, rather than help me get off the naughty list?

480
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you should have seen what he did to me. It was a fashion disaster.

481
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:26,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I was just trying to be like them.

482
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:35,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait a second, Buddies. We all have our own karma.

483
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:38,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Puppy Paws is not responsible for me losing my center.

484
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:40,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To find faults in him,

485
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we're really just finding faults in ourselves.

486
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:45,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Zen dude is correctamundo.

487
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:47,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was only trying to fit in.

488
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:05,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was only jealous 'cause the dawg schooled me in the hip-hop battle.

489
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:08,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess I ate myself onto the naughty list.

490
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:12,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's my responsibility to get myself off, not Puppy Paws'.

491
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:13,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We should be ashamed of ourselves.

492
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:17,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Poor Puppy Paws doesn't have any brothers or sisters.

493
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:19,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I couldn't imagine not having you guys.

494
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's embrace Puppy Paws with compassion.

495
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:37,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where did the dude go?

496
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:00,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Christmas icicle is almost gone.

497
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:07,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wouldn't believe it if I didn't see it with my own eyes.

498
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:11,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When Puppy Paws left, the icicle started melting even faster.

499
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:16,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If we don't find Puppy Paws, Christmas as we know it will be lost forever.

500
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:23,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. Come on. Come on.

501
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:30,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sniff, sniff. All right, let's go.

00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right.

504
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:53,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You won't be needing this anymore.

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Very, very funny.

00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is this place?

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The pound is where they put us dogs that no one cares about.

513
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:57,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm Puppy Paws. What's with that guy?

514
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did he get coal in his stocking or something?

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think we know where Puppy Paws is.

550
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fernfield, Washington.

551
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:52,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In search of a pup named Budderball.

552
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:55,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know how he was saying he wanted to be an ordinary pup?

553
00:44:56,950 --> 00:45:00,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Santa Claus? Santa Paws? You OK?

554
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:03,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please, bring back Puppy Paws as fast as you can.

555
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:08,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Without him I'm afraid Christmas may be gone forever.

556
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:13,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, sir! We'll be back quicker than you can say ''Candy Cane Lane.''

557
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, at least we made it.

558
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:40,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have no idea how we're going to get back. The tank is out of magic.

559
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. I'll try and find Puppy Paws.

560
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I'll see what I can do about the truck so we can get home.

561
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:56,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Where's Budderball? - That dawg ain't ever on time.

562
00:45:56,370 --> 00:45:58,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Being fashionably late is one thing,

563
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:01,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but this is way out of style.

564
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:07,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dude, am I hallucinating or is Budderball running with an elf?

565
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:09,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's an elf, all right.

566
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:12,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where does he find these dawgs? The looney bin?

567
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:17,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi, guys. Sorry I'm late.

568
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:20,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I had another surprise visitor from way up north.

569
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:23,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is Eddy. He claims to be Santa Paws' head elf.

570
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We need your help. Christmas is in great danger.

571
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:29,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And we need to get Puppy Paws back to the North Pole.

572
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:32,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I for one totally love your shoes,

573
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:34,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and will do anything to help.

574
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:38,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your presence indicates that our disbelief may have been unfounded.

575
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:41,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, regardless, there is one obstacle.

576
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:43,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Puppy Paws has disappeared.

577
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Quick, hide! It's Cruge!

578
00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:51,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, let's go!

579
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Coming through! - Hurry up.

580
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:04,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no! Do you think Puppy Paws might be in the pound?

581
00:47:04,370 --> 00:47:06,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This way, dawgs!

582
00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:12,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right...

583
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:20,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No magic in the tank, no way to get home.

584
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:24,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's officially the end of Christmas spirit.

585
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:26,760


586
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Next. - Have a nice day.

587
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:31,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hello. - That's great.

588
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:48,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There it is. There you go.

589
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:51,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Look at that. Keep moving. - Thank you.

590
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:53,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I had enough magic, even just a little...

591
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey!

592
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:58,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bub, I'm all for slacking off,

593
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:01,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I've been busting my hump over here and you've been standing over here...

594
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- ...hiding out, so... - I'm not hiding out.

595
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:06,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm trying to see if I can make this sleigh fly

596
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:10,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so we can get Puppy Paws back to the North Pole and save Christmas.

597
00:48:11,370 --> 00:48:13,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Puppy Paws! Of course! Yes!

598
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have an idea!

599
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's sprinkle a little fairy dust over the reindeer

600
00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:21,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to come alive and they can fly you back to Santy Claus.

601
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:22,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you have some?

602
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:25,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. No...

603
00:48:25,790 --> 00:48:28,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you don't get back to work right now, I'm gonna tell the big boss.

604
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is killing me.

605
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:34,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You want your uniform revoked? - Of course not.

606
00:48:34,130 --> 00:48:35,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, follow me.

607
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:44,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think anyone's home.

608
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:47,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe we should come back another time, dawgs?

609
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:49,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dudes, look!

610
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:50,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a hole in the back!

611
00:48:52,610 --> 00:48:54,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yo, dawgs, hold up!

612
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:08,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK, you know the plan. Budderball, you're on lookout.

613
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:10,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bark twice if Mr. Cruge returns.

614
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:13,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mudbud and B-Dawg, you find the key.

615
00:49:13,170 --> 00:49:15,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buddha, Eddy and I will find Puppy Paws.

616
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:18,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Got it? - Go! Quickly!

617
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:21,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Come on, let's go! - Hurry.

618
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:29,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Puppy Paws? - Puppy Paws!

619
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eddy! Is that you?

620
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:33,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Over here, last cage.

621
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:35,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eddy, I'm so happy to see you.

622
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm so sorry I messed everything up.

623
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}From now on, I promise to be good for goodness sake.

624
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:43,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're gonna need you to be great for greatness sake.

625
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:45,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Christmas icicle has all but melted now.

626
00:49:45,770 --> 00:49:47,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Santa Claus and Santa Paws need you back.

627
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your dad has grown very weak.

628
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:52,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your dad is Santa Paws?

629
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:55,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There isn't going to be a Christmas?

630
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I won't let that happen, Tiny.

631
00:49:57,610 --> 00:50:00,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You pups taught me the true meaning of Christmas spirit.

632
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:02,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not just about presents.

633
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:05,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In fact, it's not about presents at all.

634
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:08,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's about things you can't wrap in a box or tie with a bow.

635
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:12,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}First, find my collar so we can get out of here.

636
00:50:12,290 --> 00:50:13,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll retrieve it.

637
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:19,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- The key is not in here. - It's not over here, dawg.

638
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:21,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've gotta find Puppy Paws' collar.

639
00:50:26,810 --> 00:50:29,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's too many, dawg. Which one is it?

640
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:34,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I remember! It looks like a candy cane.

641
00:50:37,390 --> 00:50:38,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There it is!

642
00:50:58,170 --> 00:50:59,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's about time.

643
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:00,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hurry!

644
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:09,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow! I can't thank you guys enough.

645
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what friends do, help each other out of a jam.

646
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:29,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Budderball, if you're here, then who's on the lookout?

647
00:51:34,810 --> 00:51:36,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're coming to me now!

648
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:38,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You guys go. I'll take care of him.

649
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:39,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And we will help.

650
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:42,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You would be willing to do that for Christmas?

651
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:44,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's us or saving Christmas, right?

652
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:49,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This job just gets easier and easier.

653
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:52,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get back in your cage.

654
00:51:52,330 --> 00:51:55,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get out of here! Quickly! Eli's waiting for you in front of town hall.

655
00:51:55,630 --> 00:51:58,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You guys can do it. I know you can.

656
00:51:58,570 --> 00:52:00,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're our Christmas miracle.

657
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We won't let you down, Tiny.

658
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:05,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, let's go!

659
00:52:07,910 --> 00:52:09,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Follow me.

660
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:14,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Watch out! Coming through!

661
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:15,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Move over, guys!

662
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:22,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go away! Go away!

663
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:29,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go away. Go away!

664
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:32,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm ticklish!

665
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm ticklish!

666
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:45,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm ticklish!

667
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:56,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eli, wake up!

668
00:52:57,590 --> 00:52:58,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Puppy Paws!

669
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:01,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've got to get back to the North Pole right away!

670
00:53:01,530 --> 00:53:04,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- How'd you get here? - The mail truck.

671
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:06,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But it doesn't have enough power to get us back.

672
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:09,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've been trying to figure out how to get this sleigh to work, but...

673
00:53:11,110 --> 00:53:13,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Puppy Paws, your collar!

674
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:16,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It might have enough magic to make this thing fly.

675
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:18,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's lighter than the truck and it needs a lot less power.

676
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:20,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But we still need reindeer.

677
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:24,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There are no reindeer in Fernfield other than those plastic ones there.

678
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:26,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait a sec! We know how to pull a sleigh.

679
00:53:26,990 --> 00:53:28,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me get this straight, Elf Dude.

680
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All we have to do is pull the sleigh

681
00:53:30,730 --> 00:53:33,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and Puppy Paws' magic collar will make it fly?

682
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:34,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is correct.

683
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:39,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Will you guys do it? - B-Dawg is all about the heroics.

684
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:43,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yo, P-Squared, you need help saving Christmas,

685
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we're your Buddies.

686
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:45,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's do it!

687
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:55,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For that little stunt, there'll be no dinner.

688
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:05,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll bet you haven't laughed like that in a long time.

689
00:54:08,830 --> 00:54:10,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who said that?

690
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:15,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We know all about you at the North Pole.

691
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:17,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You didn't get a puppy when you were a boy,

692
00:54:17,510 --> 00:54:19,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and it made you hate Christmas.

693
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:23,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But Santa knew that your mother was very allergic to dogs,

694
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:25,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that it wasn't right for your family.

695
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:29,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know a lot of things about you, Stan Cruge.

696
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:34,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you talking to me?

697
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:37,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm from the North Pole where we can communicate with all creatures.

698
00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:39,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's part of the Christmas magic.

699
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:43,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you know the best way to heal your broken heart

700
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:45,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is to give to those in need.

701
00:54:54,110 --> 00:54:55,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What has gotten into me?

702
00:54:56,010 --> 00:54:59,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Christmas, sir. Christmas has gotten into you.

703
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:05,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's time to let Christmas back into your heart.

704
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:11,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I would love to stay for eggnog, but I have to get back to the North Pole

705
00:55:11,630 --> 00:55:13,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and help save Christmas.

706
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:32,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dawgs, it just struck me that we ain't playin' no more.

707
00:55:32,110 --> 00:55:35,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This Santa stuff is for real, yo.

708
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:37,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK, you're all set.

709
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:39,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We only have one shot at this,

710
00:55:39,390 --> 00:55:42,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so it's important you believe you can fly without a shadow of a doubt.

711
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Ready, Buddies? - That's ''reindogs'' to you, bro.

712
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:47,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Next stop, the North Pole.

713
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:06,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you see that?!

714
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:10,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're flying.

715
00:56:13,550 --> 00:56:15,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I most certainly did.

716
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:17,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, yes, they are flying.

717
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:27,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- This is so fly! I'm flying! - But I'm afraid of heights!

718
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:29,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Budderball, don't look down.

719
00:56:31,010 --> 00:56:33,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yo, dawgs, there's the dog pound.

720
00:56:33,270 --> 00:56:35,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's do a flyby.

721
00:56:53,930 --> 00:56:58,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guys, wait. Does anyone actually know how to get to the North Pole?

722
00:56:58,430 --> 00:57:00,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just follow the North Star.

723
00:57:15,150 --> 00:57:17,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The best way to heal your broken heart

724
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:20,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is to give to those in need.

725
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:13,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you feel that?

726
00:58:13,370 --> 00:58:15,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Somewhere, somehow,

727
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:18,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}somebody just decided they believed in Christmas after all.

728
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:22,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It only takes one person to change the lives of many.

729
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:26,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Santa Claus, I do believe the Christmas spirit has begun its turnaround.

730
00:58:31,930 --> 00:58:36,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see, the magic is stored all year round in the great Christmas icicle

731
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:38,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and is released at Christmas.

732
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If people don't believe in Christmas,

733
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:44,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then there isn't enough magic for us to make the toys or fly the sleigh.

734
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, if there isn't enough Christmas spirit,

735
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:50,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then the icicle that stores the magic will melt and...

736
00:58:50,510 --> 00:58:52,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...Christmas will be gone forever?

737
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:53,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Precisely.

738
00:58:53,710 --> 00:58:56,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Children will never get to experience the joy of Santa,

739
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:58,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or learn about the spirit of Christmas.

740
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:02,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To children, you are Santa's elf.

741
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:05,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's why your job as an elf representative is so important.

742
00:59:05,390 --> 00:59:07,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't actually work for us directly,

743
00:59:07,530 --> 00:59:10,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but you do work to spread Christmas spirit.

744
00:59:10,230 --> 00:59:13,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And if you don't believe, neither will the children.

745
00:59:15,270 --> 00:59:17,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow.

746
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks, Eli.

747
00:59:18,970 --> 00:59:22,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See, I had no idea my job was so darn important.

748
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:24,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here comes my boss.

749
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:26,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That little dog is your boss?

750
00:59:28,450 --> 00:59:30,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eddy, this is Clark.

751
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:32,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He's an official elf representative. - Hey.

752
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:35,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eli, we'd better get back to the North Pole, lickety-split.

753
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:37,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Santa's gonna need all the help he can get.

754
00:59:37,590 --> 00:59:39,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He can talk?

755
00:59:39,930 --> 00:59:41,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't have enough magic to power the truck.

756
00:59:42,030 --> 00:59:46,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We will soon. Eli, things are turning around.

757
00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:47,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happened at the pound?

758
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:49,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Christmas. That's what happened.

759
00:59:53,010 --> 00:59:56,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Remember your promise, Clark. - I will.

760
00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:59,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Merry Christmas.

761
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:08,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There it is, Buddies. The North Pole.

762
01:00:11,030 --> 01:00:13,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can land right by Santa's house.

763
01:00:13,230 --> 01:00:14,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yo, don't worry, P-Squared.

764
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:17,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are in good paws with the B-Dawg.

765
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:32,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess I overshot the landing a little.

766
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:33,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You could say that again.

767
01:00:43,990 --> 01:00:45,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad!

768
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:48,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Son!

769
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:51,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm so sorry for not believing.

770
01:00:51,670 --> 01:00:54,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just didn't understand how important Christmas was.

771
01:00:54,770 --> 01:00:56,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I'm sorry I was so hard on you.

772
01:00:56,970 --> 01:01:00,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I should have trusted you would come to that realization yourself.

773
01:01:00,510 --> 01:01:03,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, it took the help of a few friends.

774
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:12,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buddies! Nice to see you again.

775
01:01:13,350 --> 01:01:15,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How've you been behaving, Budderball?

776
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:17,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Any more turkey infractions?

777
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:20,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, Mr. Paws. I haven't even sneaked a cookie.

778
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:25,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, big fella, we'll have to see about getting you off Santa's naughty list

779
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:27,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and back onto the nice list.

780
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That would make my Christmas special, sir.

781
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:32,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can vouch for all the good karma Budderball has created

782
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:34,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}since the infraction in question.

783
01:01:34,110 --> 01:01:37,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your wisdom is appreciated, Buddha. Namaste.

784
01:01:37,910 --> 01:01:40,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are totally stoked to help, Santa Dude.

785
01:01:40,550 --> 01:01:42,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bro, that would be super rad.

786
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:46,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll make sure we all do everything we can to make Christmas happen.

787
01:01:46,490 --> 01:01:50,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rosebud, your leadership skills are exemplary.

788
01:01:50,090 --> 01:01:54,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If memory serves, you're near the very top of Santa's nice list.

789
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:58,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you all for coming. We're very behind here at Santa's workshop,

790
01:01:58,570 --> 01:02:02,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and it's going to take all the help we can get to make Christmas happen.

791
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:24,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yo, I gotta give props to those elves.

792
01:02:25,030 --> 01:02:27,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They know how to get it done.

793
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:32,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are back in business!

794
01:02:32,770 --> 01:02:34,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that Santa Claus?

795
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:36,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, that's Santa himself!

796
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:39,030


797
01:02:39,070 --> 01:02:41,300


798
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:44,680


799
01:02:44,710 --> 01:02:48,010


800
01:02:48,850 --> 01:02:52,080


801
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:53,750


802
01:02:53,790 --> 01:02:57,620


803
01:02:58,730 --> 01:03:00,920


804
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:05,660


805
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:11,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Puppy Paws! It's so great to see you!

806
01:03:12,470 --> 01:03:14,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What a glorious day!

807
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:17,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you're right on time!

808
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:19,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The great Christmas icicle is back!

809
01:03:19,410 --> 01:03:22,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Santa, my friends the Buddies have come to help!

810
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:26,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Welcome, Buddies!

811
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:30,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As you can see, there's still lots of toys to be made for children and puppies

812
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}all over the world.

813
01:03:32,090 --> 01:03:35,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're gonna need all hands and paws on deck!

814
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:46,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're back.

815
01:03:47,510 --> 01:03:49,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's quite a haul you've got there.

816
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:53,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}From the looks of this load, I'd say Christmas spirit is on the rise.

817
01:03:53,210 --> 01:03:56,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, peopIe, let's get these letters opened on the double.

818
01:03:56,780 --> 01:03:58,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Christmas Eve's a-comin'.

819
01:03:58,850 --> 01:04:02,850


820
01:04:02,890 --> 01:04:04,880


821
01:04:04,930 --> 01:04:07,220


822
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:11,430


823
01:04:11,470 --> 01:04:13,490


824
01:04:13,530 --> 01:04:15,430


825
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:18,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Budderball, nice haul.

826
01:04:18,270 --> 01:04:19,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey!

827
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:30,080


828
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:32,110


829
01:04:32,150 --> 01:04:33,180


830
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}B-Dawg...

831
01:04:43,730 --> 01:04:46,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Thanks, Mr. Cruge. - Merry Christmas!

832
01:04:59,650 --> 01:05:02,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Merry Christmas!

833
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:05,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here it comes... Yeah! There it is!

834
01:05:10,930 --> 01:05:12,450


835
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:18,790


836
01:05:40,890 --> 01:05:42,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We did it!

837
01:05:47,330 --> 01:05:49,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, Santa, we're ready for a test flight.

838
01:05:50,030 --> 01:05:53,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK, everyone, let's give this our best effort.

839
01:05:53,030 --> 01:05:56,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's cross all our fingers and paws...

840
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:14,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Comet, Donner, Blitzen! Are you OK?

841
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:17,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, Santa Claus.

842
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:21,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We still don't seem to have enough strength to even fly the empty sleigh.

843
01:06:32,010 --> 01:06:35,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Christmas icicle is growing, but not fast enough.

844
01:06:35,910 --> 01:06:39,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Buddies and I flew the small sleigh to the North Pole

845
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:41,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with the little magic left in my crystal.

846
01:06:41,350 --> 01:06:43,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe we can fly Santa's sleigh?

847
01:06:52,860 --> 01:06:55,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What's happening? - That's what happens to the leader.

848
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:57,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's to light the way for the rest of us.

849
01:06:58,030 --> 01:07:00,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think we're going to call you Ru-Dawg.

850
01:07:00,130 --> 01:07:04,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now that's tight. My nose shines just like my bling.

851
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:05,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Prepare for departure.

852
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:14,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good luck, son. Stay focused.

853
01:07:14,150 --> 01:07:16,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tonight is the most important night of the year.

854
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:19,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All good children and puppies are counting on you.

855
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:23,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No matter what happens tonight, I want to thank you, Buddies.

856
01:07:23,190 --> 01:07:25,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're the best friends I've ever had.

857
01:07:25,090 --> 01:07:29,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We should thank you. We had stopped believing in Christmas until we met you.

858
01:07:29,230 --> 01:07:31,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Enough of this Kumbaya stuff.

859
01:07:31,530 --> 01:07:33,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm in it to win it!

860
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:36,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, Buddies, it's up to us to save Christmas!

861
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Bye! - Goodbye!

862
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:48,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Merry Christmas.

863
01:08:55,820 --> 01:09:00,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Santa, I know it's late to be making Christmas wishes...

864
01:09:00,820 --> 01:09:04,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I know I've been playing like I don't believe in Santa Claus...

865
01:09:04,190 --> 01:09:05,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't need any presents.

866
01:09:06,430 --> 01:09:09,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The only thing I want for Christmas...

867
01:09:09,460 --> 01:09:12,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...is for the Buddies to be safe at home. Amen.

868
01:09:49,740 --> 01:09:51,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}''Dear Santa,

869
01:09:55,540 --> 01:09:58,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know this is a lot to ask,

870
01:09:58,980 --> 01:10:03,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but this year if you could find a puppy

871
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:06,750
