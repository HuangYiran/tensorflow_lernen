1
00:00:02,116 --> 00:00:04,284
左边选手领先
Advantage left-side competitor.

2
00:00:06,871 --> 00:00:08,405
哇  你游刃有余啊
Wow, you're really good at this.

3
00:00:08,407 --> 00:00:11,575
我重心极低
Well, I have an extremely low center of gravity.

4
00:00:11,577 --> 00:00:14,795
就像个金字塔
I'm like a pyramid.

5
00:00:17,248 --> 00:00:18,498
你那儿怎么样了?
How you doing over there?

6

00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,002
噢  我希望这只是扭伤
Oh, I hope it's just a sprain.

7
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,254
我不要又因为电子游戏伤
I cannot walk into that E.R.

8
00:00:24,256 --> 00:00:27,440
进那个急诊室了
with another video game injury.

9
00:00:27,442 --> 00:00:29,759
嘿  Sheldon  你一会儿玩吗?
Hey, Sheldon, you want to play next?

10
00:00:29,761 --> 00:00:32,145
哦  我想玩  但我要出门了
Oh, I would, but I'm on my way out.

11
00:00:32,147 --> 00:00:35,381
-去哪儿?   -德克萨斯州
-Where?  -Texas.

12
00:00:35,383 --> 00:00:37,350
现在?
Right now?

13
00:00:37,352 --> 00:00:38,435
为什么?
Why?

14
00:00:38,437 --> 00:00:39,920
是不是有人病了?  是的
Is someone sick? Yes.

15
00:00:39,922 --> 00:00:43,523
我姐姐的子宫上长出了个孩子
My sister's uterus came down with a baby.

16
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:46,359
噢  她怀孕了? 太棒了
Oh, she's pregnant? That's great.

17
00:00:46,361 --> 00:00:48,328
你成舅舅了呢  Sheldon舅舅
You're gone an uncle-- Uncle Sheldon.

18
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:51,064
不  我会变成Cooper博士舅舅
No, I will be Uncle Dr. Cooper.

19
00:00:51,949 --> 00:00:54,034
你怎么能从来不提她怀孕的事?
How come you never said she was pregnant?

20
00:00:54,036 --> 00:00:56,036
额  我从没告诉你我哥哥的肾结石啊
Well, I never told you about my brother's kidney stone.

21
00:00:56,038 --> 00:00:57,287
你难道想知道
You want to hear about everything

22
00:00:57,289 --> 00:00:59,372
关于我家庭成员生殖器的一切事宜吗?
that comes out of my family's genitals?

23
00:01:00,341 --> 00:01:01,908
好吧  恭喜  很棒呢
Well, congrats, and it's nice

24
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,339
你要在那儿照顾你姐姐
you're gonna be there for your sister.

25
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,069
是的
Yes.

26
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:06,079
我要填补她丈夫的空缺  
I'm filling in for her husband who's recovering

27
00:01:06,081 --> 00:01:08,381
他刚从一个严重的机动车事故中痊愈
from a horrible motorcycle accident.

28
00:01:08,383 --> 00:01:10,600
幸运的家伙
Lucky duck.

29
00:01:10,602 --> 00:01:13,419
那你要去多久呢?
Wow, so, how long will you be gone?

30
00:01:13,421 --> 00:01:15,222
嗯  明天她就生了
Well, she's due tomorrow.

31
00:01:15,224 --> 00:01:17,307
她可是花了六年完成高中学习的
Although it did take her six years to finish high school,

32
00:01:17,309 --> 00:01:18,758
所以谁知道呢?
so who knows?

33
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,977
要我载你去机场吗?
Can I give you a ride to the airport?

34
00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:23,596
噢不了  谢谢  我不想成为一个累赘
Oh, no, thank you, I don't want to be an inconvenience.

35
00:01:23,598 --> 00:01:24,898
快快快  Leonard
Chop-chop, Leonard.

36
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,900
我们十分钟后出发
We leave in ten minutes.

37

生活大爆炸第七季第11集

47
00:01:57,606 --> 00:01:59,657
好嘞  万事俱备
All right, here's the deal.

48
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,876
Sheldon走了  所以圣诞树装饰条例
Sheldon is gone, so the tree decorating rules

49
00:02:01,878 --> 00:02:02,910
全部废除
are out the window.

50
00:02:02,912 --> 00:02:03,928
是的  这意味着
Yeah, which means

51
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,430
我们可以不用这个可笑的
we don't have to use his ridiculous

52
00:02:05,432 --> 00:02:08,332
装饰间隔装置
ornament-spacing template.

53
00:02:08,334 --> 00:02:10,518
而且我很开心地宣告它的kickstarter项目
(通过网站进行公众集资以提供人们进行创意项目的筹集资金)
And I'm happy to report its kickstarter campaign

54
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,387
筹集资金维持在零美元呢
is holding strong at zero dollars.

55
00:02:13,389 --> 00:02:16,307
等等  这么说星球大战和星际迷航的角色
Wait, so Star Wars and Star Trek characters

56
00:02:16,309 --> 00:02:18,592
可以装饰在同一根树枝上了?
can go on the same branch?

57
00:02:18,594 --> 00:02:19,894
我知道  这很疯狂
I know, it's crazy.

58
00:02:19,896 --> 00:02:21,929
欢迎来到雷电堡!
Welcome to the Thunderdome, people!

59
00:02:23,733 --> 00:02:25,099
我还从没干过这个呢
I've never done this before.

60
00:02:25,101 --> 00:02:26,400
很有意思呢
It's kind of fun.

61
00:02:26,402 --> 00:02:27,434
是的  如果你妈现在看到
Yeah, if your mom could see

62
00:02:27,436 --> 00:02:28,753
她的受戒犹太小男孩
her little Bar Mitzvah boy right now,

63
00:02:28,755 --> 00:02:29,871
她会心脏病发
she'd have a heart attack.

64
00:02:29,873 --> 00:02:32,373
好主意  我来照张相
Good idea, I'll take a picture.

65
00:02:36,444 --> 00:02:38,329
亲爱的  今年我手头有点儿紧呢
Honey, I'm a little strapped for cash this year,

66
00:02:38,331 --> 00:02:41,632
所以圣诞节我打算给你
so for Christmas I was thinking of giving you...

67
00:02:41,634 --> 00:02:44,502
这个
this.

68
00:02:44,504 --> 00:02:45,837
哦我喜欢
I love it.

69
00:02:45,839 --> 00:02:47,171
好
Okay.

70
00:02:47,173 --> 00:02:49,140
但这也是你去年给我的
But it is what you got me last year.

71
00:02:49,142 --> 00:02:51,175
对  还有昨晚
Yeah. And last night.

72
00:02:53,263 --> 00:02:54,812
嗨
Hello.

73
00:02:54,814 --> 00:02:56,180
嗨  Stuart
ALL: Hi, Stuart.

74
00:02:56,182 --> 00:02:57,231
噢  不错  我很高兴你们
Oh, good, I'm glad you guys

75
00:02:57,233 --> 00:02:58,566
没有等我就开始了
didn't wait for me to start.

76
00:02:58,568 --> 00:02:59,800
虽然你们说了是7点
Although you said 7:00

77
00:02:59,802 --> 00:03:02,687
而且现在  现在是7点  但没关系
and it's-it's 7:00, but that's fine.

78
00:03:04,991 --> 00:03:08,442
噢  可能是Sheldon呢
Oh, it's probably Sheldon.

79
00:03:08,444 --> 00:03:09,560
嗨  Sheldon
Hi, Sheldon.

80
00:03:09,562 --> 00:03:11,829
大家都在呢  打个招呼吧
Everybody's here, say hi.

81
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:12,980
-嗨  -哥们你好
-Hey.  -Hey. Hey, buddy.

82
00:03:12,982 --> 00:03:14,481
嗨
Howdy. Hi.

83
00:03:14,483 --> 00:03:16,250
你好
Hello.

84
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,337
我前脚刚走
The second I go out of town

85
00:03:19,339 --> 00:03:21,655
你们就趁我不在办圣诞派对了?
you throw a Christmas party without me?

86
00:03:21,657 --> 00:03:23,291
额  算是吧
Yeah, kind of.

87
00:03:23,293 --> 00:03:24,959
太贴心了
That's so thoughtful.

88
00:03:24,961 --> 00:03:26,794
你们真是美国好朋友
You guys are the best.

89
00:03:26,796 --> 00:03:29,514
嘿  你姐姐怎么样了?
Hey, how's your sister?

90
00:03:29,516 --> 00:03:32,049
一小时前就开始阵痛了
She went into labour an hour ago.

91
00:03:32,051 --> 00:03:34,501
太好了  那你现在在医院咯?
That's wonderful. So you're at the hospital?

92
00:03:34,503 --> 00:03:36,271
没  她选在家里生...
No, she chose to have a home birth...

93
00:03:36,273 --> 00:03:38,175
因为她想活在石器时代
because she wants to live in the Stone Age

93
00:03:38,175 --> 00:03:41,175
可这里没有洞穴
and a cave wasn't available.

94
00:03:41,177 --> 00:03:44,362
其实  很多人认为
You know, many people believe

95
00:03:44,364 --> 00:03:46,364
在家分娩更好
that home births are better because the mother

96
00:03:46,366 --> 00:03:47,865
因为家里的环境温暖舒适
is in a warm, comfortable environment

97
00:03:47,867 --> 00:03:49,951
还有家人的悉心照料
where she can be nurtured by loved ones.

98
00:03:49,953 --> 00:03:51,702
然后家里的地板
And turn the bedroom floor

99
00:03:51,704 --> 00:03:54,688
变成羊水滑梯
into an amniotic Slip 'n Slide.

100
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:57,408
Shelly  快来!
Shelly, come on!

101
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,710
你姐姐子宫已经完全张开了
Your sister's fully dilated

102
00:03:59,712 --> 00:04:01,996
她想在鲜血四溅之前
and she wants a nice family picture

103
00:04:01,998 --> 00:04:05,082
来一张温馨的全家福!
before there's blood everywhere!

104
00:04:05,084 --> 00:04:06,700
哦  天呐
Oh, boy.

105
00:04:06,702 --> 00:04:10,371
真不该在今天穿这件拉风的机器人T恤
I picked the wrong day to wear my good robot T-shirt.

106
00:04:12,591 --> 00:04:14,342
如果你怀了Sheldon的孩子
If you were having Sheldon's baby

107
00:04:14,344 --> 00:04:16,310
你真希望他在产房里围观?
would you really want him in the room?

108
00:04:16,312 --> 00:04:18,212
那啥  如果他们真能共处一室造人
Yeah, if he's in the room when they're making the baby,

109
00:04:18,214 --> 00:04:20,765
我给你10美刀
I'll give you ten dollars.

110
00:04:21,733 --> 00:04:23,100
嗨  我带了电影《美好人生》过来
Hey, I brought over It's a Wonderful Life

111
00:04:23,102 --> 00:04:24,819
待会一起看啊
if you guys want to watch it later.

112
00:04:24,821 --> 00:04:26,053
哦  我超爱那部
Oh, I love that movie.

113
00:04:26,055 --> 00:04:27,021
从没看过
I've never seen it.

114
00:04:27,023 --> 00:04:28,923
-我也是  -电影可棒了
-Me neither.  -It's great.

115
00:04:28,925 --> 00:04:31,776
那是在圣诞节  Jimmy Stewart万念俱灰
It's Christmastime and Jimmy Stewart's really depressed

116
00:04:31,778 --> 00:04:34,328
打算跳桥自杀  结束自己的生命...
and he's gonna jump off a bridge and kill himself...

117
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,547
不必看了  正经历着
Don't need to see it. Living it.

118
00:04:37,532 --> 00:04:38,666
后来他有幸目睹如果自己未曾出生
But then he gets to see what the world

119
00:04:38,668 --> 00:04:41,068
世界又会如何
would be like if he'd never been born.

120
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,453
那你们设身处地想过吗?
Hey, you ever imagine what that would be like?

121
00:04:42,455 --> 00:04:43,838
如果自己没有来到这个世界?
Not being born?

122
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,572
你认为呢?
What do you think?

123
00:04:45,574 --> 00:04:47,008
你认为呢?
What do you think?

124
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:49,176
你认为呢?
What do you think?

125
00:04:51,046 --> 00:04:53,014
你们拿Sheldon开玩笑
You make jokes about Sheldon,

126
00:04:53,016 --> 00:04:54,348
但要不是他
but if it weren't for him,

127
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,700
我想我们此时
I don't think any of us

128
00:04:55,702 --> 00:04:57,635
我们就不会像现在这样坐在一起
would be sitting in this room right now.

129
00:04:57,637 --> 00:04:59,220
讲真的?  正是因为Sheldon不在
Really? Sheldon not being here

130
00:04:59,222 --> 00:05:02,056
我才愿意在这屋里待着
is the main reason I'm in this room.

131
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:04,925
真的啊
It's true.

132
00:05:04,927 --> 00:05:06,644
不然你们不会认识我
None of you would know me.

133
00:05:06,646 --> 00:05:08,396
也不会与Bernadette相识
You wouldn't know Bernadette.

134
00:05:08,398 --> 00:05:10,815
-你没机会和Penny拍拖  -才不是呢
-You wouldn't be dating Penny. -You don't know that.

135
00:05:10,817 --> 00:05:12,617
我常年去芝士蛋糕店吃饭
I've been going to the Cheesecake Factory for years.

136
00:05:12,619 --> 00:05:13,734
可能就泡上她了
I could have picked her up.

137
00:05:17,573 --> 00:05:20,441
哦  你没在开玩笑啊
Oh, you weren't joking.

138
00:05:20,443 --> 00:05:21,375
当然
No.

139
00:05:21,377 --> 00:05:22,910
好吧  甜心  让我来告诉你
Okay, sweetie, let me tell you

140
00:05:22,912 --> 00:05:24,996
那样故事会如何发展
exactly how that would have gone down.

141
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:29,667
我决定了  我要约她出去
I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna ask her out.

142
00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:34,171
我的乳头要喷出巧克力牛奶
I'm gonna squirt chocolate milk out of my nipples.

143
00:05:34,173 --> 00:05:36,290
抱歉  我还以为我们在讨论
Sorry, I thought we're saying things

144
00:05:36,292 --> 00:05:38,009
绝不会发生的事情呢
that are never gonna happen.

145
00:05:38,011 --> 00:05:40,394
也许这次他真的会迈出这步
Maybe this time he's going to do it.

146
00:05:40,396 --> 00:05:42,346
口渴了吧  给你挤奶喝
Hope you're thirsty, here it comes.

147
00:05:45,017 --> 00:05:46,400
看着吧
Watch me.

148
00:05:46,402 --> 00:05:49,770
嗨  你们希望现在就点还是再等会?
Hey, you guys ready to order or you need a few minutes?

149
00:05:49,772 --> 00:05:51,055
我  呃  唔  我....
I, uh, ah, um, I...

150
00:05:51,057 --> 00:05:52,606
那就再等会儿
A few minutes it is.

151
00:05:53,975 --> 00:05:56,911
你没约她出去  倒是出了不少声
You didn't ask her out, but that was a lot of sounds.

152
00:05:58,613 --> 00:06:00,364
你们这些混蛋让我很忐忑
You guys are making me nervous.

153
00:06:00,366 --> 00:06:02,083
好吧  你自己找她说话
Fine, then go talk to her on your own.

154
00:06:02,085 --> 00:06:04,118
我就去
I will.

155
00:06:11,176 --> 00:06:12,376
不好意思
Excuse me.

156
00:06:12,378 --> 00:06:13,627
什么事?
Yeah?

157
00:06:13,629 --> 00:06:16,830
你好  唔  我是那个Leonard
Hi, uh, um, I'm Leonard?

158
00:06:16,832 --> 00:06:19,833
真的吗?  你好像不太确定
Really? You don't sound so sure.

159
00:06:19,835 --> 00:06:22,803
不  我就是他
No, I am he.

160
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:27,174
呃  不过  唔
Uh, any-anyway, um,

161
00:06:27,176 --> 00:06:29,310
有些事很久以前
there's been something I've wanted to ask you

162
00:06:29,312 --> 00:06:31,445
就想问你了  唔...
for a long time. Um...

163
00:06:31,447 --> 00:06:33,280
-什么事?  -呃  就是
-What's that?  -Eh, uh, well,

164
00:06:33,282 --> 00:06:35,682
我想知道  如果你有空的话
I was wondering... if you're not too busy...

165
00:06:35,684 --> 00:06:37,101
唔  如果...
um, uh, if,

166
00:06:37,103 --> 00:06:39,787
如果你会告诉我
if you'd be interested in...

167
00:06:40,572 --> 00:06:44,075
洗手间在哪?
...telling me where the restroom is?

168
00:06:47,629 --> 00:06:49,246
恐怕来不及了
I think you're too late.

169
00:06:49,248 --> 00:06:53,968
拜托  我肯定不会尿裤子的
Come on, I would not have peed my pants.

170
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,869
-她说的没错  -听起来就是这样
-She nailed it.  -Sounds about right.

171
00:06:56,888 --> 00:06:59,507
你别忘了  在现实生活中我真的约过你
But, you forget, I did ask you out in real life.

172
00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:01,976
如果你们没住对门也就不会发生
Which couldn't have happened if you didn't live across the hall

173
00:07:01,978 --> 00:07:04,311
还不多亏了Sheldon
from her, which couldn't have happened without Sheldon.

174
00:07:04,313 --> 00:07:05,813
你俩也一样
Same goes with you guys.

175
00:07:05,815 --> 00:07:07,181
如果Leonard没和Penny在一起
If Leonard wasn't with Penny,

176
00:07:07,183 --> 00:07:08,682
她也不会撮合你和Bernadette
she never would have set you up.

177
00:07:08,684 --> 00:07:10,551
这没关系  Bernadette还是会在
Doesn't matter. Bernadette still would've been working

178
00:07:10,553 --> 00:07:11,852
芝士蛋糕店工作
at The Cheesecake Factory,

179
00:07:11,854 --> 00:07:14,888
我也依旧是宝刀未老的"鸡肉"美男
and I still would've been working this beefcake factory.

180
00:07:16,525 --> 00:07:18,993
你肯定会将我扑倒
You would've been all over me.

181
00:07:18,995 --> 00:07:20,694
这个嘛...
Well...

182
00:07:23,115 --> 00:07:24,999
Penny  我能接手那桌吗?
Hey, Penny, can I take that table?

183
00:07:25,001 --> 00:07:26,117
当然啦  为什么啊?
Sure, why?

184
00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:28,252
那个高领男是我的菜
The one in the turtleneck is cute.

185
00:07:28,254 --> 00:07:29,736
张大嘴嘴咯
Open wide,

186
00:07:29,738 --> 00:07:32,289
开心小火车要进站啦
here comes the happy train.

187
00:07:33,842 --> 00:07:37,578
嗯  狂吃  狂吃  美味  美味啊
Mm-hmm, chug-a chug-a, yum, yum.

188
00:07:38,913 --> 00:07:40,965
噢
Oh.

189
00:07:40,967 --> 00:07:42,749
别动
Hang on.

190
00:07:43,685 --> 00:07:46,187
你脸上... 沾了点东西
You got a... you got a little something.

191
00:07:49,474 --> 00:07:51,091
还是算了吧
Never mind.

192
00:07:52,778 --> 00:07:54,645
我的老天
Oh, man,

193
00:07:54,647 --> 00:07:57,097
我们还真是这样的
that is so us.

194
00:08:01,153 --> 00:08:03,120
说起来  也许你我没有在一起
You know, maybe you and I wouldn't be together,

195
00:08:03,122 --> 00:08:04,938
但你肯定比现在过得糟
but you wouldn't have done so great yourself.

196
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,440
-凭什么?  -因为我清楚的很
-Why? -Because I know exactly

197
00:08:06,442 --> 00:08:08,609
你会和哪种男人共度余生
the kind of guy you would've ended up with.

198
00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:13,380
嘿  宝贝
Hey, babe.

199
00:08:13,382 --> 00:08:15,049
嘿  没忘交房租吧? 
Hey. Did you remember to pay the rent?

200
00:08:15,051 --> 00:08:17,835
比交了更赞  我用那些钱买了这些魔法豆呢
Better. I used the money to buy these magic beans.

201
00:08:19,004 --> 00:08:21,088
他也许是个傻蛋  
He may be an idiot, but at least

202
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:22,840
但至少他没尿自己一身啊
he didn't pee himself.

203
00:08:24,626 --> 00:08:26,844
莫急
Oh, hold on.

204
00:08:27,813 --> 00:08:29,796
嗷  宝贝  我尿裤子了
Aw, babe, I peed myself.

205
00:08:31,566 --> 00:08:33,818
我也是啊
Me, too.

206
00:08:40,075 --> 00:08:43,444
全剧终
The end.

207
00:08:47,449 --> 00:08:48,866
嗨  Sheldon
Hi, Sheldon.

208
00:08:48,868 --> 00:08:50,150
一切都好吗?
Everything okay?

209
00:08:50,152 --> 00:08:52,870
不  一点都不好
No, it's not.

210
00:08:52,872 --> 00:08:54,707
我看到了些东西
I've seen things.

211
00:08:55,888 --> 00:09:00,160
女人身上的东西
Lady things.

212
00:09:00,161 --> 00:09:01,828
听我说
Listen to me.

213
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,665
那不是它们本来的样子
That is not the way they usually look.

214
00:09:07,486 --> 00:09:09,103
无所谓
Doesn't matter.

215
00:09:09,105 --> 00:09:11,772
这不是在繁衍生息
This is no way to make new humans.

216
00:09:11,774 --> 00:09:14,058
人从人身体里出来
People coming out of people.

217
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,895
这明明是某种恶俗的魔术节目
It's some kind of dirty magic show.

218
00:09:17,897 --> 00:09:20,564
Sheldon Lee Cooper！
Sheldon Lee Cooper.

219
00:09:20,566 --> 00:09:23,400
你现在赶紧滚回这间房
You get back in this room right now.

220
00:09:23,402 --> 00:09:25,686
带着拖把
Bring a mop.

221
00:09:25,688 --> 00:09:27,020
你听到没?
Did you hear that?

222
00:09:27,022 --> 00:09:28,689
拖把
A mop.

223
00:09:28,691 --> 00:09:31,158
我堂堂一个双博士学位的学者
I have two PhDs yet somehow I'm the janitor

224
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,127
如今沦为我姐姐产道的清洁工
of my sister's birth canal.

225
00:09:42,673 --> 00:09:45,958
快看  Sheldon给我们发了群邮件
Hey, Sheldon sent us all an e-mail.

227
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,894
来自德克萨斯的节日祝福 
"Happy holidays from Texas." 

228
00:09:47,896 --> 00:09:49,095
还有图片呢
And there's pictures.

229
00:09:49,097 --> 00:09:50,163
我去啊啊!
Aah!

230
00:09:50,165 --> 00:09:52,232
别打开  千万别打开
Don't open them. Do not open them.

231
00:09:52,234 --> 00:09:54,184
拜托
Oh, come on.

232
00:09:54,186 --> 00:09:56,152
生产是一种自然的  美丽的...
Childbirth is a natural, beautiful...

233
00:09:56,154 --> 00:09:59,189
天哪  好像有人把一头牛锯成两半
Oh, it's like someone sawed a cow in half.

234
00:10:02,076 --> 00:10:05,862
我老爸是个妇科医生  我觉得我能挺住
My father's a gynecologist, I think I can handle it.

235
00:10:06,497 --> 00:10:09,049
如此这般  好吧  我甘做基佬
And, now, I'm gay.

236
00:10:11,369 --> 00:10:13,152
真的  我在想如果没有Sheldon
You know, I was thinking. Without Sheldon,

237
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,504
我们大多会是陌路人
most of us would have never met,

238
00:10:14,506 --> 00:10:16,589
但Penny还是会住在他对面
but Penny would still live across from him.

239
00:10:16,591 --> 00:10:19,492
这么一来Leonard便出局了
And with Leonard out of the picture,

240
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:21,094
接下来想必各位心知肚明
we all know what that would mean.

241
00:10:21,096 --> 00:10:22,729
真的?
We do?

242
00:10:25,983 --> 00:10:27,600
是你呢  Sheldon
Hey, Sheldon.

243
00:10:27,602 --> 00:10:29,769
你好
Hello.

244
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,806
洗衣服呢?
Doing laundry?

245
00:10:36,811 --> 00:10:38,978
我当然在洗衣服
Of course I'm doing laundry.

246
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,697
星期六是洗衣之夜
Saturday night is laundry night,

247
00:10:40,699 --> 00:10:43,182
并且我就在洗衣房里  所以...
and I'm in a laundry room, so...

248
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,068
我确信你的推理很合理
I believe your inference is justified.

249
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:47,620
噢  我的推理很合理
Oh, my inference is justified.

250
00:10:47,622 --> 00:10:50,156
Sheldon  你太幽默了
Sheldon, you are so funny.

251
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,462
总之  我也要洗衣服
Anyway, I need to do my laundry, too,

252
00:10:55,464 --> 00:10:58,865
因为这些衣服实在太"脏"了
because these clothes are so dirty.

253
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:02,669
几乎就和穿着它们的放荡女一样脏
Almost as dirty as the dirty girl who's wearing them.

254
00:11:05,205 --> 00:11:06,139
好了  适可而止啊
Okay, that's enough.

255
00:11:06,141 --> 00:11:08,692
-反对  -继续啊  多来点
-Disagree.  -Keep going. More.

256
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:13,179
你觉得怎么样?
So, what do you think?

257
00:11:13,181 --> 00:11:18,318
有点不对称  但没什么可担心的
A tad asymmetrical, but nothing to be concerned about.

258
00:11:19,653 --> 00:11:21,688
拜托了  Sheldon  我想要你
Please, Sheldon. I need you.

259
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:25,058
做... 什么?
To... what?

260
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,160
占有我(带我走)
To take me.

261
00:11:27,162 --> 00:11:30,697
你不穿件衣服我是不会带你去哪的
I'm not taking you anywhere till you put on a shirt.

262
00:11:31,866 --> 00:11:35,234
来吧  Sheldon  咱们在这儿大干一场
Come on, Sheldon. You and me right here.

263
00:11:35,236 - -> 00:11:37,921
Penny  我已经说过一千遍了
Penny, for the thousandth time,

264
00:11:37,923 --> 00:11:41,073
我要为我的梦中情人保留处子之身
I'm saving myself for someone special.

265
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:44,048
或许是位可爱的神经学家四眼妹
Perhaps a cute bespectacled neuroscientist

265
00:11:44,048 --> 00:11:48,548
有着一头泥土色秀发  
with hair the color of mud.

267
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:51,184
我知道怎么让你改变主意
I think I know how to change your mind.

268
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,304
够了  呕~~~
That's enough. Ew...

269
00:11:55,189 --> 00:11:57,557
我觉得还行
I was okay with it.

270
00:12:01,863 --> 00:12:04,063
怎么样了  Sheldon?
How's it going, Sheldon?

271
00:12:04,065 --> 00:12:05,482
现在好多了
Actually, much better.

272
00:12:05,484 --> 00:12:06,983
那太好了  孩子出生了吗?
Oh, good. Is the baby born yet?

273
00:12:06,985 --> 00:12:09,135
我不知道  我刚回来
I don't know. I just got back.

274
00:12:09,137 --> 00:12:10,203
你去哪儿了?
Where'd you go?

275
00:12:10,205 --> 00:12:13,206
我妈让我去拿几条毛巾
My mother asked me to get some towels.

276
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,441
我利用这个模糊请求
I took advantage of the vague request

277
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:18,011
去了趟床上用品超市透透气
and went to Bed, Bath & Beyond.

278
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:23,950
小声点儿! 我在打电话呢!
Excuse me! I'm on the phone!

279
00:12:25,419 --> 00:12:28,354
太没礼貌了
So rude.

280
00:12:29,456 --> 00:12:31,708
还有一个  Penny
Here's another one. Penny,

281
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,092
要不是Sheldon
if it weren't for Sheldon,

282
00:12:33,094 --> 00:12:37,680
你怎么能见到漫画界传奇人物Stan Lee呢?!
you never would have met comic book legend Stan Lee.

283
00:12:38,816 --> 00:12:41,067
真走运
Great.

284
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:46,172
至少我  Leonard还有Howard还是朋友
At least Leonard, Howard and I would have always been friends.

286
00:12:46,174 --> 00:12:48,908
你们仨怎么没住在一起呢?
Hey, how come you three never got an apartment together?

287
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,143
我们谈过这个事儿 
We talked about it, 

288
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:54,330
显然Howard跟他妈妈如胶似漆
but Howard was in a pretty serious relationship with his mom.

289
00:12:54,332 --> 00:12:57,000
我跟她住一起是为了省钱
I lived with her to save money.

290
00:12:57,002 --> 00:12:58,384
对  饭费也省了
Yeah, you didn't have to buy groceries

291
00:12:58,386 --> 00:12:59,419
因为你喝奶就行了
'cause you were breast-feeding.

292
00:13:00,455 --> 00:13:03,756
所以要不是我  
Aw, so I guess if it weren't for me,

293
00:13:03,758 --> 00:13:05,508
你现在还跟你妈妈住吧?
you'd still be living with her, huh?

294
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,510
也不会
Not exactly.

295
00:13:07,512 --> 00:13:08,761
你说"也不会"是什么意思?
What do you mean, "not exactly"?

296
00:13:08,763 --> 00:13:11,998
情况也许会有逆转
Well, things would be a little different.

297
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,001
Howard  我的午餐呢?!
Howard, where's my lunch?!

298
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:18,137
我快饿死了!
I'm starving!

299
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:19,606
我知道你快饿死了
I know you're starving.

300
00:13:19,608 --> 00:13:21,391
隔壁邻居也知道你快饿死了
The neighbors know you're starving.

301
00:13:21,393 --> 00:13:24,677
饱受饥荒的非洲难民都知道你快饿死了!
There's starving people in Africa who know you're starving!

302
00:13:26,564 --> 00:13:29,249
就这么点儿?! 这怎么够吃啊!
That's it?! There's not enough food!

303
00:13:29,251 --> 00:13:33,553
你把地球上的食物都吃光了! 我有什么办法!
Well, you cleaned out Earth! I don't know what else to do!

304
00:13:34,138 --> 00:13:36,806
这哪儿有不一样啊?
How is this any different?

305
00:13:36,808 --> 00:13:39,292
我还没说完
You didn't let me finish.

306
00:13:39,294 --> 00:13:41,794
给你  老母亲
Here you go, Mother.

307
00:13:41,796 --> 00:13:44,297
Howard  好孩子
You're a good boy, Howard!

308
00:13:44,299 --> 00:13:48,084
真是个好孩子
Such a good boy!

309
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:55,241
等等  她是自己死的还是你杀死的?
Wait, did she die or did you kill her?

310
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:01,014
还不是一回事儿  重要的是她死了
Eh, tomato, tomahto. The important thing is she's dead.

311
00:14:02,683 --> 00:14:05,768
那你俩怎么没一块儿住?
Hey, so how come you two didn't move in together?

312
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:07,520
这家伙想一个人住
This guy wanted a place of his own

313
00:14:07,522 --> 00:14:09,822
因为他很肯定他会有女朋友
because he was sure he was gonna be a ladies' man.

314
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,443
是啊  我错了
Yeah, I was wrong.

315
00:14:14,528 --> 00:14:17,363
但我真心觉得咱俩同居一定其乐无穷
But I do think you and I would have had a great time.

316
00:14:17,365 --> 00:14:20,250
Leonard  来吃晚饭了
Come on, Leonard, dinner.

317
00:14:20,252 --> 00:14:22,185
来了
Coming.

318
00:14:30,961 --> 00:14:32,161
等会儿
Hang on.

319
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:33,846
为什么我这么肥?
Why would I be fat?

320
00:14:34,932 --> 00:14:37,300
你没有女朋友  没人会看你的裸体
You'd have no girlfriend to see you naked,

321
00:14:37,302 --> 00:14:40,053
你就用食物来填补空虚
you'd try to fill the void with food,

322
00:14:40,055 --> 00:14:43,255
而我则是个厨神
and I'm an enabler who once deep-fried a pancake.

323
00:14:43,857 --> 00:14:45,975
为什么你不胖呢?
Why can't you be fat, too?

324
00:14:47,561 --> 00:14:50,280
甜点想吃什么?
What do you want to do for dessert?

325
00:14:52,316 --> 00:14:55,418
好像早餐还剩了半个蛋糕
I think there's still half a cake from breakfast.

326
00:14:57,204 --> 00:14:59,372
怎么会剩
No, there's not.

327
00:15:04,128 --> 00:15:07,080
兄弟们好
Hey, guys.

328
00:15:07,082 --> 00:15:08,998
-Stuart  -Stuart
-Stuart  -Stuart.

329
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
你在干吗?
What are you doing?

330
00:15:11,002 --> 00:15:18,341
我只是想出现在你们任何一个人的故事中
I... just wanted to be in anyone's story.

331
00:15:18,343 --> 00:15:20,710
但你为什么也这么肥呢?
Yeah, but why are you fat?

332
00:15:22,763 --> 00:15:25,264
因为Leonard很肥
'Cause Leonard was fat.

333
00:15:27,101 --> 00:15:28,735
Amy  你呢?
Amy, what about you?

334
00:15:28,737 --> 00:15:30,937
要是没遇到Sheldon  你觉得你现在在干吗?
What do you think you'd be doing if you never met Sheldon?

335
00:15:30,939 --> 00:15:33,072
很难说
It's hard to say,

336
00:15:33,074 --> 00:15:35,325
我的生活将大不相同
my life would be so... different.

337
00:15:35,327 --> 00:15:38,978
你可以说"变得更好"  Sheldon又听不到
You can say "better." Sheldon can't hear you.

338
00:15:40,247 --> 00:15:41,648
我不知道
I don't know.

339
祝我生日快乐
Happy birthday to me

340
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:51,691
祝我生日快乐
Happy birthday to me

341
00:15:53,093 --> 00:15:57,296
泪水落在糖霜上
There's tears in the frosting

342
00:16:03,904 --> 00:16:08,041
祝我生日快乐
Happy birthday to me.

343
00:16:17,484 --> 00:16:19,152
我会就此打住
I'll stop now.

344
00:16:22,656 --> 00:16:24,240
进展如何  Sheldon?
How's it going, Sheldon?

345
00:16:24,242 --> 00:16:25,691
结束了
That's it.

346
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,460
孩子诞生了
The baby's here.

347
00:16:27,462 --> 00:16:28,527
是个男孩!
It's a boy.

348
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,329
-恭喜恭喜  -太棒了
-Congrats. Aw. -Yay.

349
00:16:30,331 --> 00:16:32,048
谢谢
Oh, thank you.

350
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:34,366
我都不知道我能挺过来
I wasn't sure I was gonna to make it.

351
00:16:36,003 --> 00:16:39,055
但是我妈妈给了我些沙冰
But my mother gave me some ice chips,

352
00:16:39,057 --> 00:16:41,090
姐姐叫我深呼吸
my sister told me to breathe.

353
00:16:41,092 --> 00:16:43,042
我在心里告诉自己
And I just thought to myself, "Sheldon,

354
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:45,228
"Sheldon啊  如果《绿灯侠》你都能坚持看完"
"if you can make it through the Green Lantern movie,

355
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,379
"这个绝不再话下啊"
you can make it through this."

356
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,749
干得好  哥们
Well, good for you, buddy.

357
00:16:49,751 --> 00:16:51,200
那我们不聊了  你先回去吧
We'll let you get back in there.

358
00:16:51,202 --> 00:16:53,152
不不不  我不想回去
Oh no, no, I'm not going back in there.

359
00:16:53,154 --> 00:16:55,888
那娃太讨人厌了
That baby is so irritating.

360
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:59,158
他简直就是用生命在哭泣
He has literally been crying his entire life.

361
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,296
他已经在向Shelly舅舅学习了呢
Aw, he's already taking after Uncle Shelly.

362
00:17:04,498 --> 00:17:06,416
Sheldon  你应该回去的
Come on, Sheldon, you should go.

363
00:17:06,418 --> 00:17:07,583
为什么?
Why?

364
00:17:07,585 --> 00:17:09,519
你总是抱怨  成长过程中
Well, you always complain that you never

365
00:17:09,521 --> 00:17:11,587
从未有智慧的榜样让你崇拜
had an intelligent role model growing up,

366
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:13,823
而现在你为侄子的树立榜样
and now you can be one for your nephew.

367
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:18,044
好吧  那我回去
Ugh, all right, I'll go.

368
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,013
但如我所见
But from what I've seen, his attention span

369
00:17:21,015 --> 00:17:23,466
他的注意力与膀胱控制力一样让人失望
is as limited as his bladder control.

370
00:17:24,802 --> 00:17:26,719
他还真听你的
You actually got him to do it.

371
00:17:26,721 --> 00:17:27,920
是呀  你一直说
Yeah, you keep saying

372
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:29,639
Sheldon给我们的影响有多大
how much Sheldon has affected all of us,

373
00:17:29,641 --> 00:17:32,024
但你其实一直在影响他
but you've clearly had an impact on him.

374
00:17:32,026 --> 00:17:33,643
真是这样的话
If that were true,

375
00:17:33,645 --> 00:17:35,611
我就不会现在还独居了
I wouldn't still be living alone.

376
00:17:35,613 --> 00:17:36,929
也不算完全独居
Well, not exactly alone.

377
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:39,198
我那还有一袋50磅重的大米
I do have a 50 pound sack of rice

378
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,068
穿着Sheldon的一件T恤
with one of Sheldon's T-shirts on it.

379
00:17:44,671 --> 00:17:47,874
坦白说  Sheldon比你想的更在乎你
I'm telling you, Sheldon cares for you more than you think.

380
00:17:47,876 --> 00:17:50,442
真希望我能相信你的话
I wish I could believe you.

381
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:53,146
我还希望Sheldon米人里面没有老鼠寄居
I also wish there wasn't a mouse living in Rice Sheldon.

382
00:17:56,283 --> 00:18:00,286
等下  送你件圣诞预热小礼物
Hang on, I'm gonna give you a little early Christmas present.

384
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:02,839
我给你看点东西  但你要告诉Sheldon
I'm gonna show you something, but if you ever told Sheldon

385
00:18:02,841 --> 00:18:04,757
他可能再也不会理我了
he'd probably never speak to me again.

386
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:07,343
所以你真想告诉他的话  那也行
So, if you want to tell him, that's fine.

387
00:18:07,345 --> 00:18:09,428
瞧
Look.

388
00:18:12,182 --> 00:18:14,567
什么意思
I don't understand.

389
00:18:14,569 --> 00:18:16,986
他用你的照片作屏保啊
He made you his screensaver.

390
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,939
哦对哦
Oh.

391
00:18:19,941 --> 00:18:21,073
哇
Wow.

392
00:18:21,075 --> 00:18:24,277
我都不知道
I had no idea.

393
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:26,913
他爱死我了
He is so into me.

394
00:18:28,782 --> 00:18:30,266
等等等下
Wait, wait,

395
00:18:30,268 --> 00:18:31,317
我的照片呢?
where'd I go?

396
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,669
屏保的照片有你  还有沼泽异形
Oh, well, it's you, Swamp Thing,

397
00:18:33,671 --> 00:18:34,704
霍金  蜘蛛侠... 
Stephen Hawking, Spider-Man...

398
00:18:34,706 --> 00:18:37,173
不过  你是其中一个哟
but, look, you're in the mix.

399
00:18:37,175 --> 00:18:39,491
我是其中一个!
I am in the mix.

400
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,460
而且是最辣的那个
And I'm the hottest one.

401
00:18:41,462 --> 00:18:42,712
那是谁?
Who's that?

402
00:18:42,714 --> 00:18:44,463
那是居里夫人
Oh, Madame Curie.

403
00:18:44,465 --> 00:18:46,632
没事  她已经死了
That's fine, she's dead.

404
00:18:59,112 --> 00:19:00,813
你没事吧?
You okay?

405
00:19:01,732 --> 00:19:04,016
就是很高兴你回来了
Just really glad you're back.

406
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:05,651
我也这么想
Me, too.

407
00:19:06,738 --> 00:19:09,355
还有很多剧要追呢
I got a lot of TV to catch up on.

408
00:19:15,212 --> 00:19:17,296
我想你了
I missed you.

409
00:19:17,298 --> 00:19:20,833
引用星球大战Han Solo的台词 "我懂得"
To quote Han Solo, "I know"

410
00:19:24,537 --> 00:19:26,472
想我了吗?
Did you miss me?

411
00:19:26,474 --> 00:19:29,058
我更希望当时有你陪着我
I would've preferred to have you there with me.

412
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,760
哦
Oh.

413
00:19:30,762 --> 00:19:32,595
或者你替我在那
Or instead of me.

414
00:19:35,882 --> 00:19:37,266
你抱过小婴儿了吗?
Did you hold the baby?

415
00:19:37,268 --> 00:19:38,851
抱过了
I did.

416
00:19:38,853 --> 00:19:40,353
然后呢?
And? 

417
00:19:40,355 --> 00:19:42,738
感觉怎么样?
How did it make you feel?

418
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,024
面对空洞无知的眼神
Looking into the blank, innocent eyes

419
00:19:45,026 --> 00:19:47,193
又一个不懂我的
of a creature that couldn't begin to comprehend

420
00:19:47,195 --> 00:19:48,894
生物
anything I was saying?

421
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,747
基本就跟在办公室的日子一模一样
Basically just another day at the office.

422
00:20:00,425 --> 00:20:02,126
我这就去
I'm gonna do it.

423
00:20:02,128 --> 00:20:03,761
我这就去约她
I'm gonna ask her out.

424
00:20:06,014 --> 00:20:09,500
是呀  我的乳头要喷巧克力牛奶了
