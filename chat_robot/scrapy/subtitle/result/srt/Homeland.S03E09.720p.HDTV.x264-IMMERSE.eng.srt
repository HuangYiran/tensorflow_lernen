1
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,550
<i>Air and naval forces of the United States</i>

2
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,430
<i>launched a series of strikes against terrorist facilities...</i>

3
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:14,930
<i>Pan Am Flight 103 crashed into the town of Lockerbie.</i>

4
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:18,300
<i>He has sanctioned acts of terror</i> <i>in Africa, Europe and the Middle East.</i>

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,150
<i>This will not stand, this aggression against, uh, Kuwait.</i>

6
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,210
<i>This relentless pursuit of terror.</i> <i>We will make no distinction...</i>

7
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,040
<i>The USS Cole was attacked</i> <i>while refueling in the port of Aden.</i>

8
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,260
This was an act of terrorism.

9
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,890
It was a despicable and cowardly act.

10
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,730
<i>The next samba we're going to swing for you</i> is one of the good old favorites.

11
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,310
...until something stops him.

12
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:41,640
<i>It was right in front of my eyes,</i> <i>and I never saw it coming.</i>

13
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,210
<i>That plane crashed into the World Trade Center.</i>

14
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,150
<i>Thousands of people running.</i>

15
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:53,040
We must and we will remain vigilant at home and abroad.

16
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:59,940
<i>You're the smartest and the dumbest fucking person</i>

17
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,230
<i>I've ever known.</i>

18
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,820
<i>I'm not the one who got it wrong.</i>

19
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,890
<i>I'm the only one who got it right.</i>

20
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,290
<i>Take 'em.</i> <i>Take 'em all.</i>

21
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,060
<i>Previously on Homeland...</i>

22
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,510
I got plans for you. What plans?

23
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,410
I'm gonna play you back into Iran.

24
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:32,910
From now on, you work for us.

25
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,890
The Senator's made some serious allegations.

26
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:40,870
That you had Majid Javadi in a safe house on American soil and let him go.

27
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:44,610
We debriefed him, turned him. He's ours.

28
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:48,830
I've made a decision to give the marriage another chance.

29
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:03,180
So I told him something before you left... about the Langley bomber.

30
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,100
You mean Brody.

31
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,100
No, that's just it. It's not him.

32
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,600
The bomber's the only way to prove that Brody's innocent.

33
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,770
Carrie, what the fuck are you doing?

34
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,200
Carrie, turn around now.

35
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,250
This is your last warning.

36
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,110
Got a gunshot wound to the upper left bicep.

37
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,510
significant bleeding. Might have clipped an artery.

38
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,460
Where the fuck is Saul?

39
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,420

42
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,170
You're awake.

43
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,400
Where am I? The Naval hospital.

44
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,480
They brought you here after you were shot.

45
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,420
Careful, you don't want to rip the sutures. Quite a few of them.

46
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:14,550
It was a through and through. Missed the bone.

47
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:18,340
Some muscle and tissue damage but no nerve involvement.

48
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,650
You're lucky.

49
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,470
No, he's just a great shot.

50
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:29,310
How long will I be in here? As long as you need to be.

51
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,920
For me to heal or for the CIA to figure out what to do with me?

52
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,770
You'd have to talk to them.

53
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:41,520
Are you aware you're 13 weeks pregnant?

54
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,710
Yes.

55
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,200
The baby should be fine. In case you're wondering.

56
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,150
Pupils reactive to light.

57
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,430
BP of 60 over 40. Too fucking low.

58
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:31,520
Lay down.

59
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,570
He started going cold turkey on the flight,

60
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,850
so they knocked him out - with a half pint of vodka. - Idiots.

61
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,830
Pulse is thready.

62
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:57,910
Take it easy.

63
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:02,230
Where's my stuff, you fucking thieves?!

64
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:05,860
Fuck! Where is my stuff?! Calm down, goddamn it!

65
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,940
Where's my stuff?

66
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,290
Don't move now.

67
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,400
You've got seven days till Lockhart's confirmed.

68
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,420
You think this guy's gonna be ready by then?

69
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,050
He's not what we expected...

70
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,980
but he's what we've got. If he agrees to do it.

71
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,070
He's a mess...

72
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:39,970
anemic...

73
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:43,950
severely dehydrated, probably hep C.

74
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,940
HIV isn't a stretch.

75
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,600
If you're suggesting a hospital, it's out of the question.

76
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,280
I'm pretty sure I can keep him stable, but the guy's a junkie, sir.

77
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,850
How far is he into withdrawal? Hardly started.

78
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:00,390
What he's feeling now, it's gonna get a hell of a lot worse.

79
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:05,000
Methadone would make it easier. Has to be cold turkey.

80
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,520
Where he's going, we need him functional.

81
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,430
Even if it kills him? It won't.

82
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:15,400
'Cause you will keep him alive. Do you understand?

83
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:17,480
Sir.

84
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:00,720
You all right?

85
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,370
Whoa, whoa!

86
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,740
Stop! What are you doing?

87
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,230
I need it! There's nothing there for you.

88
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,030
- No, I need it now! - No.

89
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,350
Give it to me, give it to me, give me...

90
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,990
Hey, grab him!

91
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:19,770
Where's the needle? Got it.

92
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,640
Cover him up. Stay down.

93
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,020
Please...

94
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,220
How are you feeling?

95
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,460
The doctor says you're progressing nicely.

96
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,680
You'll be up and walking in no time.

97
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,320
Though, not necessarily out of here.

98
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,040
There are two armed guards outside your door.

99
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:06,610
You know it never ceases to amaze me how you people close ranks.

100
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,350
Here you are,

101
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:13,690
a casualty of some CIA op gone very, very wrong,

102
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:19,450
basically a prisoner, and still, somehow, I'm the enemy.

103
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:24,040
You are aware that the CIA charter does not include

104
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,580
operations on US soil?

105
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,680
You know, I'm on painkillers.

106
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,950
I can barely understand anything you're saying.

107
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:34,950
Well...

108
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,700
I've been going through your file.

109
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,210
The fact is,

110
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,340
you need someone you can trust.

111
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,940
And why is that?

112
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:55,200
You're lying there shot and you need to ask?

113
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,550
The man who did this to you,

114
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,400
he's on his way out.

115
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,770
But I need to know...

116
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,530
what's he up to?

117
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,620
Ask him.

118
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,760
What was he doing in Caracas?

119
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,750
You didn't even know he was there, did you?

120
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:39,620
I got another message from Carrie.

121
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,330
Is she calming down at all? No, the opposite.

122
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,390
Senator Lockhart just paid her a visit.

123
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,020
Somehow, he knows about Caracas.

124
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,950
It's impossible. Well, he does.

125
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,160
You think he suspects? I'm sure he doesn't have a clue.

126
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,100
She does now.

127
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,320
So what do we do about that? Same as before;

128
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,550
keep her under guard at the hospital.

129
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,460
Away from Brody. And Lockhart?

130
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,700
I don't know how the hell he found out.

131
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,930
No one knew besides us.

132
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,100
Have our houses and offices swept.

133
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:26,740
Every room, top to bottom.

134
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,360
What happened? Shat himself.

135
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,910
Jesus Christ.

136
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:51,490
Who are you?

137
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,340
Don't talk.

138
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:57,000
You're soldiers, aren't you? Don't talk.

139
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,310
It's burning! It's burning.

140
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,710
It's not hot.

141
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,250
It's burning!

142
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:09,650
It'll continue as bad as this, or worse, another three days.

143
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:12,300
And at least a week after that before the stuff's out of his system.

144
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,270
So you're saying ten days. We have six.

145
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:18,890
Plus, at the end of all this, he's gonna be weak as a fuckin' kitten.

146
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,710
There is another option.

147
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,540
What?

148
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,070
Ibogaine.

149
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:30,130
It's a drug based on a Nigerian plant.

150
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:34,020
It dramatically accelerates the withdrawal process and kills the addiction.

151
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:37,800
The side effects are brutal, which is why it's outlawed here.

152
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,590
Nausea, vomiting, some hallucinations.

153
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:44,580
Violent, mind-bending hallucinations.

154
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,850
Does it work?

155
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,740
It does.

156
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:50,870
Take my word.

157
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,570
 Say something, you motherfucker.

158
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:30,050
Don't just stand there.

159
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,360
Say something...

160
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,550
 Of United States Marine.

161
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,490
God...

162
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,290
Get out.

163
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,070
Get out!

164
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,570
What the fuck did you give me?!

165
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,710
No...

166
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,980
Give me that! Get off me!

167
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:02,800
Get off!

168
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:10,200
Get off of me! Get off!

169
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,000
Get off me, no!

170
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,130
He'll sleep now.

171
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:41,760
For a while.

172
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,720
Maybe we should just call Saul's landline, trigger the voice activation,

173
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,510
double-check our tracking program. We could.

174
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:00,970
But...?

175
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:04,760
This house is leased to a shipping consortium out of Tel Aviv.

176
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,610
- It's got Mossad written all over it. - Yeah,

177
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:09,790
but what if it's just a monitoring station, or a dead drop?

178
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,510
Then we're wasting our fucking time.

179
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,920
Are you gettin' this?

180
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,510
You're alive.

181
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,800
That wasn't a given.

182
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,760
Want some water?

183
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:16,450
Why couldn't you have just left me there to die?

184
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,280
I think you know that wasn't really an option.

185
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:24,560
So...

186
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,780
what now?

187
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,550
That'll be up to you.

188
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,160
A trial?

189
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,820
'Cause I didn't do it.

190
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,770
You talking about bombing the CIA?

191
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,910
I'm inclined to agree.

192
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:52,660
But your transgressions don't begin or end there.

193
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,870
And I'm not about to engage in a back and forth where you somehow end up the victim.

194
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,290
We both know what you've done.

195
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:05,610
We both know what you are.

196
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:09,870
A man who's dug himself into a hole so deep,

197
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:12,410
common sense'd tell you there's no way out.

198
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,020
I am telling you, though, that there might be.

199
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,520
How?

200
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:29,990
I'm offering you a chance to be a Marine again.

201
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,330
The man you were...

202
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:39,050
before they broke you.

203
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,490
Please.

204
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:52,980
No more.

205
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,370
I'm done.

206
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:56,910
You are not.

207
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:03,160
You will do this one last thing.

208
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,050
No.

209
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,960
So kill me. Kill me now.

210
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:18,340
You want to die, huh?

211
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,490
We'll see about that.

212
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,210
Put him overboard.

213
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,480
Fuck this shit. I'm going in.

214
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,300
Don't. He'll come up.

215
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,990
I don't believe this.

216
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,240
Fuck it. Let's go.

217
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,230
Pull him...

218
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,760
He went down like a stone.

219
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,910
No attempt to save himself whatsoever.

220
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:24,540
Now he's refusing to eat. Make him.

221
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,310
How do you expect us to do that? It's called force-feeding.

222
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:31,840
All due respect, sir, the guy's a waste of space.

223
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,990
Now, I suggest whatever you've got in mind for him, just push it six months.

224
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:36,560
Let us do this thing right.

225
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,190
You done letting us in on your thought process?

226
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,540
Yes, sir.

227
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,920
Get him to eat.

228
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:54,590
He's right, you know. Our window's closing fast.

229
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:55,980
It's now or never, Saul.

230
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:18,370
How you feeling? As if you actually cared.

231
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,200
You know, I've had time to think here.

232
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:28,040
And I keep coming back to the fact that this bullet in my shoulder

233
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,440
would never have happened without your okay.

234
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,300
You were about to compromise the mission.

235
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:36,860
I was about to clear Brody. You said you were behind that.

236
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:39,150
"Clear Brody. " What does that even mean?

237
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:42,130
So you lied to me.

238
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,620
I don't think you want to go there-

239
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,840
who lied to whom.

240
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:51,660
Brody slipping out of the country while you were unconscious for 14 hours.

241
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,550
You think I believed that for a second?

242
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,380
You know I was in Caracas, you left me a message.

243
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,430
Don't you want to know how he is?

244
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,620
How is he?

245
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,180
He's not well.

246
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:37,010
What did you do to him?

247
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,970
You know, the assumptions behind that question are so misguided, it frightens me.

248
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,910
I found him in a bad way.

249
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,250
Believe me.

250
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,310
It wasn't something I wanted.

251
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:02,040
Where is he?

252
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,750
In Virginia.

253
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,170
At Dam Neck.

254
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,240
Got a special ops team trying to get him in shape.

255
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,130
In shape for what? That's what I wanted to talk about.

256
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,440
I have a play.

257
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,490
It involves Brody.

258
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:27,930
And I'm hoping you'll convince him it's in everyone's interest.

259
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:38,840
You told me Javadi was the play. He is.

260
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,530
Brody's the next phase.

261
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:44,020
And you need me why?

262
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:47,630
I'm assuming he already turned you down. We didn't get that far.

263
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:49,400
Like I said, he's not well.

264
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,840
So, what is it? What's your big idea?

265
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,500
Darnish Akbari.

266
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,100
Head of Iran's Revolutionary Guard.

267
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,060
Right.

268
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,350
Javadi's boss.

269
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,960
And the single greatest impediment to peace.

270
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,070
I want him gone.

271
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,940
Well, good luck with that.

272
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,890
Brody can get to him.

273
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:23,530
How?
As the Langley bomber.

274
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,670
Brody seeks political asylum there.

275
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:29,280
Gets an audience with Akbari, takes him out.

276
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:33,550
Javadi's the heir apparent.

277
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:36,280
He ascends the throne, and he goes from being

278
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:40,270
one of the 20 most important people in Iran to one of three.

279
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,740
Only he's working for us.

280
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,150
Brody takes him out?

281
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:51,260
Yes. Come on, Saul, you're reaching.

282
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,450
Akbari's better protected than the Ayatollah.

283
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:58,490
Brody's got a knack for getting into tight places.

284
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:02,940
He's done it before. At best it's a suicide mission.

285
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,860
No, he'll have a team on the ground.

286
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,800
And you expect me to convince him of this?

287
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:16,680
I expect you to consider deeply the upside of placing a US asset at the very top of the Iranian food chain.

288
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,210
That's what I expect.

289
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:24,490
Javadi won't be just an intelligence source.

290
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:29,380
He'll be in control of the entire Iranian security apparatus.

291
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:32,240
That doesn't mean he'll roll over and play dead.

292
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:34,120
I know.

293
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:36,150
But he can do something.

294
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,700
Something to break the long jump.

295
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,170
Something besides another war.

296
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,860
Something that'll change the facts on the ground...

297
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,080
just enough...

298
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,060
so two countries that haven't been able to communicate

299
00:26:56,060 --> 00:27:01,280
for over 30 years except through terrorist actions and threats...

300
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,240
can sit down and talk.

301
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,030
That's the play, Carrie.

302
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:18,610
Tell me it's not worth your time.

303
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:33,170
Brody, I want you to know that I didn't know you were here until today.

304
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:34,980
I came as soon as I heard.

305
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,480
Tell me if there's anything I can do for you.

306
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,170
Anything.

307
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:38,050
When do you need him ready by?

308
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,570
27th of this month.

309
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:43,320
Why so soon?

310
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,770
It's the day Senator Lockhart's confirmation hearings begin.

311
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,300
Right.

312
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,010
Tell me what happened to him in Caracas.

313
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,930
A world of shit as far as we know.

314
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:02,750
He was gut-shot at the Colombian border.

315
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,040
Nearly died.

316
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,040
Got hooked on the painkillers, I guess.

317
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,820
There was also an incident at a mosque.

318
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:14,010
An imam and his wife were murdered.

319
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:16,530
Because of him?

320
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:17,950
Because of him.

321
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,710
I need a vehicle.

322
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:39,880
What happened to your arm? Hang gliding accident.

323
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,410
For real? Fucking CIA, Baraz.

324
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:46,380
What are you asking her questions for? Just making conversation.

325
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,770
It's the next left.

326
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,250
What now?

327
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,600
Now we wait.

328
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:17,260
We sat on the house for 24 hours.

329
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,800
And this is the only person who ever came in or out.

330
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,750
Oh, Christ.

331
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,230
You know him?

332
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:29,040
Yeah, I'm afraid so. Who is he?

333
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,880
A friend of my wife's.

334
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:38,700
His name is Alain Bernard.

335
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,590
She met him in Mumbai.

336
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:45,290
They struck up a relationship there, which may or may not be ongoing.

337
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,650
I hate to ask this, Saul, but do you think Mira's aware?

338
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:51,760
That he's an Israeli intelligence officer?

339
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,650
No.

340
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,190
Falling for the guy is her only crime.

341
00:32:57,210 --> 00:33:01,030
What do you want me to do? For the time being?

342
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:05,580
Pick him up.
Put him in a dark fucking hole.

343
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:09,040
What about Lockhart? How does he fit into the equation?

344
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:12,630
I think I buried a lead. Meaning what?

345
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:16,320
After our guy left the safe house, I followed him to Pete's Diner,

346
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,480
Capitol Hill.

347
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,530
Dana?

348
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:57,290
Dana?

349
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:57,730
Dan...

350
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:01,430
Hey, assholes, let me out! Brody...

351
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:03,610
Get off me! Oh... God...

352
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:05,660
- Let me the hell out! - Relax!

353
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,640
Brody! Motherfucker!

354
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,910
Dana, it's me! Dana!

355
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:11,580
- Get back... - Get off of me...

356
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,300
Dana!

357
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,770
Fuck. Dana!
She can't hear you, Brody.

358
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,770
You... you bitch.

359
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:22,160
You fucking bitch.

360
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:40,160
Is he in? Is he expecting you? Sir, you can't go in there.

361
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,840
I'm hosting a fund-raiser that night anyway.

362
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,500
Listen, I got to go. What the hell, Saul?

363
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,620
What is this? Open it.

364
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:10,700
Care to explain?

365
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:14,680
<i>Alain Bernard is writing a profile on me for Le Monde.</i>

366
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:19,430
20 minutes ago, Alain Bernard admitted to being an asset of Israeli intelligence.

367
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,450
And I should be concerned about this... why?

368
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,350
Because he claims he passed you information obtained

369
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:30,300
from a listening device planted in my home.

370
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:38,220
That's preposterous. Is it?

371
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:43,720
One call to Ambassador Benayoun, it would be an international incident.

372
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,160
<i>A second call to The Post,</i>

373
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:51,240
and your picture'd be on the front page of every newspaper in the country.

374
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:00,840
What do you want?

375
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,240
Time.

376
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,260
Time?

377
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:08,640
Postpone your confirmation until the middle of next month,

378
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:11,370
and these'll never see the light of day.

379
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:14,170
I don't understand.

380
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:17,250
It's a simple request. Give me a few more weeks.

381
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:18,790
That's not what I meant.

382
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:20,830
You could destroy me with this.

383
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,380
You could guarantee your own tenure as director.

384
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,300
Why are you letting me off the hook?

385
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:30,180
Because it would humiliate my wife, Senator.

386
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,900
And because it would damage the Agency.

387
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,850
Badly.

388
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,300
We have a deal?

389
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:49,330
We do.

390
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,490
I was hoping you've calmed down enough to talk.

391
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:22,840
What's Dana doing cleaning motel rooms - in the middle of nowhere? - Why?

392
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,560
Is something wrong with that?

393
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,000
- Being a maid? - There's nothing wrong with that, goddamn it-

394
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,700
 I just want to know what's going on with my daughter!

395
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:35,240
Drink it, and I'll tell you about Dana.

396
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,560
Slowly, or you'll be sick.

397
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,560
There.

398
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:02,390
Now, what's going on? Well, she's had a rough time, Brody.

399
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,440
She dropped out of school.

400
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,600
She moved out of the house.

401
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:11,670
She changed her last name.

402
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:21,220
Take me back to the motel. That's not gonna happen.

403
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,550
For Christ's sake, Carrie. I told you.

404
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:25,020
if you want to see her again you have to...

405
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:28,870
Quit your fucking games, Carrie! I need to look her in the eye.

406
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:30,410
I want her to know I'm innocent!

407
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:33,200
If you keep yelling, this conversation is over.

408
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,300
Now I would like to tell these two men to leave, can I do that?

409
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,710
What do you want?

410
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:08,240
The same thing as Saul Berenson, I'm guessing.

411
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,950
Some bullshit about me being a Marine again?

412
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:11,580
What do you want, Brody?

413
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,960
What have you always wanted?

414
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:19,320
A chance at redemption.

415
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:23,160
For the last time, Carrie. I didn't do the bombing.

416
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,450
You of all people should know that. I'm not talking about the bombing.

417
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:31,280
I'm talking about the suicide vest.

418
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:36,270
I'm talking about the death of Elizabeth Gaines

419
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:39,710
and those two Secret Service agents outside the State Department.

420
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:46,490
I'm talking about what happened to that imam and his wife in Caracas.

421
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,650
Do what Saul is asking.

422
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:03,690
- What you're asking? - All right, what I'm asking.

423
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:08,040
If not for your sake, then for Dana's.

424
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,550
Otherwise, telling her you're innocent is just...

425
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:17,430
is just one more lie.

426
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:23,570
Look at me, Carrie.

427
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:28,810
You couldn't send me out for a pack of cigarettes right now.

428
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:33,920
We'll get you ready.

429
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:38,070
You just have to be willing.

430
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:58,620
Well, look who's come out to play.

431
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,900
About fucking time. Did you get Mommy's permission?

432
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,150
Hey, shut the fuck up, everybody.

433
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,260
We're going this way.

434
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,460
You ready?

435
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:28,220
Come on. On your feet.

436
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,980
No. He needs to do it by himself.

437
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,530
Tell me when you're good to go again. Now.

438
00:41:58,530 --> 00:41:59,350
Go.

439
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,560
Sixteen Days Later

440
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,720
Find Maputo, Mozambique.

441
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:29,820
What's the frequency?

442
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:32,170
KHZ 3265.

443
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:38,900
<i>What language are they speaking?</i>

444
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:39,970
Portuguese.

445
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:49,440
Bottom three cards? Eight of clubs.

446
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:52,130
Ten of hearts.

447
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:56,230
Jack of spades?

448
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:00,930
Spell her last name.

449
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:03,090
Uh, B-A-C-Z-

450
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:05,290
<i>E- W-S-K-I. Baczewski.</i>

451
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:07,150
<i>It says here she's hotter than what?</i>

452
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:09,090
<i>- Georgia asphalt? - And who said that?</i>

453
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:12,430
Lula Fortune to Sailor Ripley <i>in Wild at Heart.</i>

454
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:13,780
Fucking-A right.

455
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:16,950
Yeah.

456
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:30,450
So, you guys got something going on?

457
00:43:31,930 --> 00:43:35,540
No. Come on, man,

458
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:38,390
I've seen the way she's checking you out when you're not looking.

459
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,500
There's nothing.

460
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:42,270
Seriously?

461
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:43,620
Seriously.

462
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,220
So, you don't mind if I... if I hit that shit then, right?

463
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:52,290
See? There is something.

464
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:53,810
I knew it.

465
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:55,210
No, go ahead. Really.

466
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:57,180
Nah, man, I'm just fucking with you.

467
00:43:57,870 --> 00:43:59,110
I'm married.

468
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:01,830
And, uh, we just had our first kid.

469
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,660
It's a boy. Name's Devon.

470
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,130
How come I didn't know that?

471
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:10,660
Just...

472
00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:14,000
I don't like talking about my family.

473
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,480
Superstitious.

474
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,510
Hey, we're on in five. In the briefing room.

475
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:32,190
Iranian patrols in the area are intermittent.

476
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:34,660
But they are well-trained and equipped.

477
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:39,090
Also, there is also an IRIAF base
in Bijar, 70 miles away,

478
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:41,300
which means they can call in air support.

479
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:42,660
What kind of planes are we talking?

480
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:47,410
Uh, some French-built F-1 Mirages impounded from Iraq after the First Gulf War

481
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:49,050
and six Chinese SU-24s.

482
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:52,080
Excuse me, can we back up a minute? Sure.

483
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,950
The guys gets me to the border... where I surrender myself?

484
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:56,010
Correct.

485
00:44:56,010 --> 00:45:01,180
We chose Marivan because several Al-Qaeda commanders also asked for political asylum there.

486
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:04,350
What happens then? I get flown to Tehran?

487
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:07,260
After a period of vetting, yeah, that's our expectation.

488
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:12,630
Okay, but what makes you think I'll ever get close enough to General Akbari to take him out?

489
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:14,910
You'll be treated as a hero of the Revolution.

490
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:18,410
The senior members of the regime, like the general,

491
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:21,380
want to take advantage of your propaganda value.

492
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:24,540
Plus Javadi's on the ground to facilitate a meeting between the two of you.

493
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:27,130
But if we don't know where or when the assassination goes down...?

494
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:31,180
You're concerned about our extraction plan. How we're gonna get you out of there once it's done?

495
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:32,460
Yeah.

496
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:34,290
I was just getting to that.

497
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:36,750
Once you're inserted at the border,

498
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:40,130
four members of your team will continue south to Nodesheh,

499
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:43,770
where they cross the mountains and make their way overland to Lavasan, 

500
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:46,590
a small city just outside Tehran.

501
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:50,280
Opposition groups there have provided us with a safe house.

502
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,900
We've already gone ahead

503
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:54,590
and put in secure Satcom.

504
00:45:54,590 --> 00:46:00,370
Our code there is...

505
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:20,610
Since when do you smoke? I don't.

506
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:22,560
I'm not.

507
00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:28,940
It just looks like I'm smoking.

508
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:35,410
There. It never happened. You saw nothing.

509
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:36,530
Nothing.

510
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:42,290
Look... I did what you asked.

511
00:46:42,290 --> 00:46:44,100
I'm doing what you want.

512
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:47,450
Now you told me you'd take me to see Dana again.

513
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:51,260
I meant after you get back. Come on, Carrie.

514
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:54,770
We both know that's a long shot.

515
00:46:57,110 --> 00:46:58,510
We made it this far.

516
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,390
That's true.

517
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:07,800
I admit, I had my doubts.

518
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:11,690
Is that why you've kept your distance?

519
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:16,350
Hey, it's fine. You're entitled.

520
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:25,920
You're loading out in six hours.

521
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,870
I'm not sure I can get you off the base and back in time.

522
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:31,530
Well, I'm not leaving until I see Dana again.

523
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:50,200
It's there. 119.

524
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:58,490
Brody, there's something you need to know.

525
00:48:01,310 --> 00:48:03,940
Before she changed her name, before she left home...

526
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:09,080
Dana was hospitalized.

527
00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:12,710
About two weeks after the bombing...

528
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,860
she tried to kill herself.

529
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:46,820
Who is it?

530
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,730
Dana, it's me.

531
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:53,350
It's your dad.

532
00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:49,090
How did you find me?

533
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:57,100
Carrie.

534
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:02,940
Can I come in?

535
00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:10,060
Dana, please?

536
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,450
Thank you.

537
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:32,780
I had to see you.

538
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:36,790
Okay.

539
00:50:36,790 --> 00:50:37,960
You have.

540
00:50:43,630 --> 00:50:46,090
Oh, my baby, I'm so sorry.

541
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:49,660
Don't be.

542
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:57,680
How are you now?

543
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:06,280
Why are you here?

544
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:14,300
I just wanted to tell you that all those things those people said I did, I didn't do.

545
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:16,290
Fine. Fine, good.

546
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:18,860
I didn't kill all those people.

547
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:21,590
It wasn't me.

548
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:23,080
I didn't do it.

549
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:35,180
And I have to leave soon. In a few hours.

550
00:51:40,870 --> 00:51:43,640
But I just wanted to see you before I go.

551
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:46,760
You did.

552
00:51:50,510 --> 00:51:53,570
Did you ever, for one second,

553
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:56,780
think about if I wanted to see you?

554
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:04,420
What... what do you want to hear?
That you were a good dad?

555
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:11,010
That despite everything, it's all okay?

556
00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:13,480
What do you want me to say?

557
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:19,740
Look...

558
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:22,950
look, here... here, just write it down.

559
00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:26,230
Really, just write it down and I will say it to you...

560
00:52:27,570 --> 00:52:31,480
as long as you promise I will never have to see you again.

561
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:40,170
Either of you.

562
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:18,670
I will come back from Tehran.

563
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:22,510
I know you will.

564
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:27,370
And not just for her.

565
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:07,980
Where the fuck were you? He wanted to talk.

566
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:11,500
He's got 45 minutes to load out. He's all set.

567
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:20,880
You took him off base. He threatened to pull out, Saul.

568
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,320
Anything could've happened out there. But it didn't.

569
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:27,390
I am truly at a fuckin' loss with you.

570
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:31,190
Have a little faith, Saul.

571
00:54:31,190 --> 00:54:34,970
Two weeks ago, there was no operation. Now there is, because of me.

572
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:38,250
I really need you to get that.

573
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:40,840
Because in order for us to pull this thing off,

574
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:43,520
we're gonna have to find a way to trust each other again.

575
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:47,610
Or at least come up with a really great plan for faking it.

576
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:34,760
Brody...

577
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:44,420
See you on the other side.

578
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:09,070

579
00:56:21,370 --> 00:56:25,760
All he has to do tonight is walk across the border and ask for asylum.

580
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:30,240
And in the unlike event that anything goes wrong? We have it covered.
