1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,586
7,549.
7,549.

2
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:05,839
噢，质数
Oh, please. Prime.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,382
4,021.
4,021.

4
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:09,050
哈, 不错的尝试
Ah, nice try.

5
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:10,176
不是质数
Not prime.

6
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:12,804
好吧, Ford中尉, 599.
Okay, Lieutenant Ford, 599.

7
00:00:12,887 --> 00:00:15,056
我可不管这个数字是不是质数
I don't care if it's a prime number or not.

8
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:17,142
- 噢，来吧. 是还是不是?
- 不是
- Oh, come on. Yes or no?
- No.

9
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:19,602
难以相信. 10个了
It's incredible. 10 for 10.

10
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:22,105
- 他太厉害了
- 这些问题把我搞得烦死了
- He's terrible.
- So I suck nat prime/not prime.

11
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:23,773
不知怎么今晚我总是想睡觉
Somehow I'm going to sleep tonight.

12
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:26,234
从这点来看, 这已经不是判断是不是质数的问题了
At this point, it's gone way beyond
you not knowing your prime numbers.

13
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:27,402
这是一个判断真假的游戏
It's a true/false game.

14
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:30,238
从统计学上来说, 单单是猜测的话,
你也至少会答对一半
Statistically, just by guessing,
you should be getting at least half of these right.

15
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:32,198
听好, 993.
Look, 993.

16
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,701
- 质数
- 嗨, 这个不难啊
- Prime.
- Come on. That's an easy one.

17
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:36,119
Hays, 你都听到了?
Are you hearing this, Hays?

18
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:37,203
没有
Not really.

19
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:38,913
我想我是太投入我的工作了
I guess I've been too busy doing my job.

20
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:41,499
我们已经穿过Atlantis城的这个区域了, Killjoy博士
We've already been through
this section of Atlantis, Dr. Killjoy.

21
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,209
你不可能没有听到
It's structurally sound.

22
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:44,169
Ford中尉...
Lieutenant Ford...

23
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:48,673
你介不介意作一下
统计学不可能性研究这篇论文的研究对象?
Would you mind being a subject of
research paper on statistical improbabilities?

24
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:52,302
这就是我在高中痛揍像你这样的小子所得的回报, 是么?
This some sort of payback for guys like me
beating up guys like you in high school, right?

25
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,358
Rodney, 今天在郊区发现了什么没有?
So, Rodney,
what's it like out there in the suburbs today?

26
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:08,943
基本上, 除了一个位于高层的储藏室
Essentially, with the exception
of the upper-level storage room,

27
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:12,822
我们可爱及天才的Dumais
告诉我它目前没有危险
which the lovely and talented Dumais
informs me is in no immediate danger,

28
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:14,824
这一片支墩没有什么问题
this pier is in relatively good shape.

29
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:16,826
即使是被随风暴而来的洪水洗劫之后?
Even after the flooding from the storm?

30
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,995
好吧, 这里阴暗潮湿, 气味也很难闻,
Well, it's dark, it's damp, and it smells terrible,

31
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,789
但从一个工程师的立场来看, 我们都很好.
but from an engineering standpoint, we're good.

32
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:22,582
回来吧
Head back.

33
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:24,084
准备回去
Heading back.

34
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:25,794
好了, 你们这些小丑, 听好了
All right, you clowns, listen up.

35
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:28,672
我并不是经常有这个机会, 所以好好听好了...
I don't often get a chance to say this, so savor it...

36
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:30,298
你们都干得很好
good work, boys and girls.

37
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:31,633
现在我们回家吧
Let's go home.

38
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,134
等等, 等等, 等等.
Wait, wait, wait.

39
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,679
Johnson和Wagner找不到了
We're missing Johnson and Wagner.

40
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,265
Wagner, Johnson, 你们在哪儿?
Wagner, Johnson, what's your position?

41
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,229
我们需要支援!
We need backup!

42
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:46,231
- 它们正朝我们过来!
- 什么?
- They're coming at us!
- What?

43
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,565
它们在哪?
Where are they?

44
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:48,733
这条走廊
Down this corridor.

45
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,151
我们出发
We're on our way.

46
00:01:58,868 --> 00:01:59,911
Johnson.
Johnson.

47
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:01,287
Johnson, 你还好吧?
Johnson, are you okay?

48
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:06,751
McKay...他死了
McKay... he's dead.

49
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:08,503
Johnson, 这里到底发生了什么?
Johnson, what happened here?

50
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,880
- 它们抓住了他
- 谁抓住了他?
- They got him.
- Who got him?

51
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:16,261
镇静. 这什么都没有.
Calm down. There's nothing here.

52
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,139
你看不见它们?
Can't you see them?

53
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,557
它们到处都是!
They're everywhere!

54
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:22,684
Beckett, 我需要一支医疗队过来
Beckett, I need a medical team down here, stat.

55
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:42,412
没用了
It's no use.

56
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:43,955
她死了
She's gone.

57
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:53,183
星际之门之亚特兰蒂斯
第一季第13集 热区
Season 1 : Episode 13 Hot Zone

58
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:03,910
McKay, 我是Beckett博士
McKay, this is Dr. Beckett.

59
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,204
急救具体是什么性质的?
What exactly is the nature of the emergency?

60
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,750
太迟了
他们已经死了
It's too late.
They're gone.

61
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:13,336
- 谁死了? 怎么死的?
- Wagner 和 Johnson.
- Who's gone? How?
- Wagner and Johnson.

62
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,171
我需要一个隔离小组过来.
I need a containment team here.

63
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:16,047
什么意思?
I'm sorry?

64
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,632
隔离小组? 为什么?
A containment team? Why?

65
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,635
人们不会只是看到了什么然后就倒下死了, 中尉
People don't just see things
and drop dead, Lieutenant.

66
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:22,846
最近一个小时
我们都在调查这个城市中未勘测的区域
We've spent the last hour
surveying unexplored areas of the city.

67
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,431
我想Wagner和Johnson接触到了什么东西
I think Wagner and Johnson
were exposed to something.

68
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:28,101
如果他们被感染了
那我们也很可能被感染了
And if they were infected,
there's a very good chance that we were too.

69
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,896
在我们搞清楚我们面对的是什么之前
我建议进行四级隔离
I recommend a level-four quarantine
until we know what we're dealing with.

70
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:33,773
同意. Carson, 你都听到了?
Agreed. Carson, you hear all that?

71
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,234
是的. 我们将会进入紧急状态并尽快处理
Aye. We'll get into our hazmat gear and head down.

72
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:38,611
先不要动. 等我先向Weir博士报告
Sit tight. I'll make sure Dr. Weir is briefed.

73
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:39,696
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

74
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:42,240
好了, 你们都听到了
女士们, 先生们, 跟我来
Okay, you heard the man.
Follow me, ladies and gentlemen.

75
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,534
这么说等着, 为什么?
我们要一直呆在这里?
So wait, what? We're just going to stay here?

76
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:46,995
对, 是这样安排的
That's the plan. Yes.

77
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,705
我可以说这实在是一个糟糕的安排么?
May I say it's a terrible one?

78
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,248
不, 你不能这么说
No, you may not.

79
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,750
我想我们应该尽快离开这里
I think we should get the hell out of here.

80
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,044
如果它是靠空气传播的
那我们已经被感染上了
If it is an airborne agent,
we may already be infected.

81
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:57,172
返回到城市中只会让其他人面临危险
Heading back to the city would only
endanger the rest of the population.

82
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,007
但如果我们还没有被感染呢?
But what if we're not infected yet?

83
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:00,383
我们无从知道
There's no way of knowing.

84
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,385
但我感觉没事. 我感觉非常好!
But I feel fine. I feel perfectly fine!

85
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:03,887
讨论结束
End of discussion.

86
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,930
Peterson, 我们必须呆在这里
Peterson, we're staying here.

87
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,516
事实上, 等一下
Actually, wait a second.

88
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:10,977
各位, 跟我来
Everyone, follow me.

89
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,951
他们已经开始建立四级隔离了
They've begun to institute a level-four quarantine.

90
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:29,537
这不会真是一场生物传染, 对么?
It can't really be a biological infection, can it?

91
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,040
我不知道这到底是什么...
I have no idea what it is...

92
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:37,921
但我同意我们应该安全地对待它
并且在城市所有有人的地方进行就地隔离
But I agree we should play it safe
and initiate self-regulated quarantine
in all populated sections of the city.

93
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,339
太过激烈了吧
That's pretty severe.

94
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:41,883
我们已经知道曾经某时
亚特兰蒂斯人确实经历过一场瘟疫
We've known for some time that
the Ancients suffered from a plague.

95
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:44,928
如果McKay他们以某种方式
不经意间发现了它并且已经被感染了
If McKay and his team have somehow
stumbled upon it and become infected,

96
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,597
我们必须采取一切可能的措施防止它扩散
we'll need to take every precaution
to prevent an outbreak.

97
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,432
好吧
All right.

98
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:53,269
我们将会关闭所有的大门
让大家都呆在各自所在的地方
We will suspend any and all gate activity
and keep everyone where they are,

99
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:58,024
重复一遍, 直到我们确切的弄明白
到底是什么杀死了Wagner和Johnson.
again, just until we have a clearer picture
of exactly what it is that killed Wagner and Johnson.

100
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:41,985
- 你根本就没有投入
- 不, 我投入了
- You have not been practicing.
- Yes, I have.

101
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,570
如果这是真正的格斗的话...
If this was really a fight...

102
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:46,114
如果这是真正的格斗
我现在已经开枪把你打倒了
if this was really a fight,
I would have shot you by now.

103
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:56,958
要知道, 不管我在这上面花费多少时间
仍然不会是你的对手
You know, no matter how many hours I put into this,
you're still going to kick my ass.

104
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,753
这不是指在我们的练习中取胜
It is not for the winning that we practice.

105
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,421
嗯, 那是什么意思?
Well, what's the point?

106
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,175
<i>各位, 请注意</i>
<i>May I have everyone's attention, please.</i>

107
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:10,555
<i>我们现在碰到一个可疑的医学情况,</i>
<i>根据Beckett的建议</i>
<i>We've run into a questionable medical situation,</i>
<i>and at Dr. Beckett's suggestion,</i>

108
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,225
<i>我们不得不决定将这个城市就地隔离</i>
<i>we have decided to put the city into</i>
<i>a self-regulated quarantine.</i>

109
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:20,523
<i>在这之后至少两个小时内</i>
<i>我们需要所有人呆在原处</i>
For at least the next couple of hours,
I need everyone to stay where they are

110
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,985
<i>并且报告所有在走廊走动的人</i>
<i>and report anyone moving freely through the halls.</i>

111
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:26,988
<i>希望你们能够理解. 谢谢</i>
I hope you understand. Thank you.

112
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,701
这到底是什么?
What the hell is this?

113
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,038
你带了无线电么?
Did you bring your radio?

114
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:39,626
这就是Wagner和Johnson所勘查的区域么?
Isn't this the same section
Wagner and Johnson were exploring?

115
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:40,585
是的
Yes.

116
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,212
这就是说我们在沿原路返回?
So we're retracing their steps?

117
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:45,340
是的. 不用担心
我的动机完全是出于自我防护
That's right. Don't worry.
My motivations are based entirely on self-preservation.

118
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,217
等等, 等等, 等等.
Wait, wait, wait.

119
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:50,136
Ford是对的
这会不会增加我们受到感染的可能性?
Ford's right.
Doesn't this increase our chances of getting infected?

120
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,096
好吧
All right.

121
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,056
让我好好给你解释清楚, 好么?
Let me spell this out for you, okay?

122
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:56,643
如果细菌不是通过空气传播的
If there is a bacterial agent and it is not airborne,

123
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,603
那我们四处看看相对来说就是安全的
then it should be relatively safe
for us to look around

124
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,689
只要我们采取了适当的预防措施
as long as we take the proper precautions.

125
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,148
但是...
However...

126
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:06,611
如果是通过空气传播的
那我们就很可能已经把感染了
if it is an airborne agent, then there's a
very good chance we've already been infected.

127
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,114
好吧, 难道我们不应该等Beckett来作确切的诊断么?
Well, shouldn't we wait for Dr. Beckett to decide that?

128
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,491
那些人到这里来只有12小时
Those men were only down there for 12 hours.

129
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:14,953
即使他们立刻就被感染
那潜伏期也是非常短的
Even if they were infected right away,
that's an alarmingly short incubation period.

130
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:18,081
现在, 如果有人已经被感染了...
噢, 我不知道, 可能我们...
Now, if anyone else is infected...
as in, oh, I don't know, maybe us,

131
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:20,417
所剩时间已经不多了, 中尉
seconds are going to count, Lieutenant.

132
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:22,585
好了, 手电
All right, light.

133
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,379
我们走
Let's go.

134
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:39,853
所有人, 呆在原地
Everybody, stay here.

135
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:41,688
Ford
Ford.

136
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:45,108
- 你刚刚告诉我...
- 所有人, 除了Ford, 呆在原地
- You just told me...
- Everybody except Ford stay here.

137
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,860
你认为我应该自己一个人进去?
You think I'm going in there by myself?

138
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,712
不要碰任何东西
Don't touch anything.

139
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,935
这可不好
This is not good.

140
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,443
我是这里的最高军事指挥官
I'm ranking military officer here.

141
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,944
是的, 我很清楚这点, 少校
Yes, I'm aware of that, Major.

142
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,530
无线电联系不到你, 而我们必须快速行动
You were off radio, and we had to act quickly.

143
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,407
所有这些已经付诸实施的方案
Now, this is all protocol that was put into place

144
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,701
在此次考察之前很久就已经制定好了
long before this expedition even began.

145
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:40,246
Bates正在我身边
并且我们同意这是最好的实施方案
Bates is here with me,
and we agreed this was the best plan of action.

146
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:41,581
好吧, 好吧
All right. All right.

147
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,666
我和Teyla正过来跟你们会合
Teyla and I are coming up to join you.

148
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,710
我们正在就地隔离, 少校
We're in a self-regulated quarantine, Major.

149
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:47,504
每个人都要呆在原地
Everyone stays where they are.

150
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,756
从东边的支墩到这里差不多有一英里
They're nearly a mile away on the east pier.

151
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,385
你认为我从这里走到控制室真的会有什么危险么?
Do you really think I'm in any sort of danger
walking from here to the control room?

152
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,012
从这点上说, 我们不知道他们在哪接触到的病毒
At this point, we don't know
where they contracted the virus.

153
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:58,264
这是一个医学状况, John.
This is a medical situation, John.

154
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,559
只有经过授权的、穿有防护服的人才被允许自由走动
Only authorized personnel in
hazmat suits are allowed to roam freely.

155
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:04,354
这些规则作用于任何人身上, 包括你
Those rules apply to everyone, including you.

156
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:09,025
好吧, 那叫个人给我送一套防护服来
Well, then get someone to bring me a hazmat suit.

157
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:13,405
每个穿戴防护服的人都在忙着布置实验室
来应对可能爆发的疾病
Everyone in hazmat is busy configuring
the lab to deal with a possible outbreak.

158
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:16,825
目前, 只要机会允许
我一定会派个人来接你
Now, if an opportunity arises,
I will send someone to come get you,

159
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,369
不过在此之前, 我们只能通过无线电联系
but in the meantime, radio contact will have to do.

160
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:21,538
好吧
All right.

161
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:24,541
那就...让我们保持联系
Just...keep us in the loop.

162
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,626
会的
Will do.

163
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:34,050
这些破碎敞开容器中的任何一个都有可能
释放出病毒, 杀死了Johnson和Wagner
Any number of these smashed and open containers could
have released the virus that killed Johnson and Wagner.

164
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:36,553
那这种东西怎么可能活了这么些年?
And how would something like that
survive for all these years?

165
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,805
病毒可以长时间保持休眠状态.
Viruses can remain dormant for long periods.

166
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,349
希望可以在数据库中找到答案.
I'm hoping the answer will be found in the database.

167
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,477
- 好吧, 我想我们应该...
- 是的, 是的, 是的.
- Okay, I think that we have to...
- Yes, yes, yes.

168
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,563
看不出跟古人的其他系统有什么网络连接
Doesn't appear to be networked in
with the rest of the Ancient systems.

169
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:49,607
事实上, 正如你看到的, 这只保存了
In fact, if you look, it only contains information

170
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:51,901
在这个房间里所进行的实验的信息
about the experiments that took place in this room.

171
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,654
Weir, 我是McKay.
Weir, it's McKay.

172
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,031
说吧, Rodney.
Go ahead, Rodney.

173
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,699
- Beckett在哪?
- 在路上
- Where's Beckett?
- On his way.

174
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:59,993
让整个医疗队都穿上防护服需要一些时间
It takes some time to load
a whole medical team into suits.

175
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:03,455
好吧, 看起来我们偶然发现了什么
我发现了...一个小麻烦
Well, we seem to have stumbled across
something that I find... a little troubling.

176
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,874
这不是我想听到的
That's not what I wanted to hear.

177
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,626
我想我们找到了一个古人的病毒实验室
I think we may have found an ancient viral lab.

178
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,378
Wagner和Johnson一定是在这里被感染的
Wagner and Johnson must have been exposed here.

179
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,255
目前, 查看所有这些数据需要数周的时间
Now, it'd take weeks to sift through all this data,

180
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:13,923
而且, 我们也不知道古人到底是
and there's no way of knowing whether the Ancients

181
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,426
仅仅只是研究这些病毒
或者是在积极地制造它们...
were just studying the viruses
or actively creating them...

182
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:18,845
不管是那种情况, 风暴已经把这里破坏得一塌糊涂
Either way, the storm has done
quite a number on this place,

183
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:19,929
并且我们已经...
and I've got...

184
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,438
它在你上面!
It's all over you!

185
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,025
他们在你上面!
他们在你上面!
They're all over you!
They're all over you!

186
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:33,902
让她躺下
Get her off.

187
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:54,798
告诉Beckett快点赶来
Tell Beckett to pick up the pace.

188
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,008
我们刚刚失去另外一个队员
I've just lost another member of our team.

189
00:11:57,676 --> 00:11:58,885
Peterson在哪?
Where's Peterson?

190
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:00,512
什么?
What?

191
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:01,596
Peterson.
Peterson.

192
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:12,440
是的, 好了, 我想我们找到他了
Yes, okay, I think we have him.

193
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:13,817
他正在找路回来
He's trying to make his way back.

194
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:15,235
应该没事的
It should be okay.

195
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:18,988
Grodin正在锁住走廊中所有的门
然后切断整个区域的电源
Grodin is locking all the doors in the hallway
and killing power to the entire section.

196
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:21,449
你需要派人去阻止他
You need to send someone to stop him.

197
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,867
都在控制之中, Rodney...
It's under control, Rodney...

198
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,953
不, Elizabeth, 不在控制之中
No, Elizabeth, it's not under control.

199
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,747
他所知道的古人的科技不比我少
He knows almost as much about
Ancient technology as I do.

200
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:31,001
你所做的一切至多也只能让他慢一点
At the very most,
what you're doing will just slow him down.

201
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,936
那条走廊通向哪里?
Where does that hallway lead?

202
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,022
一直到这里
Straight here.

203
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,072
Peterson, 我是Elizabeth Weir.
Peterson, this is Elizabeth Weir.

204
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,449
能听到我说话么?
Can you hear me?

205
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:06,161
我无法想象这整个经历是多么的令人恐惧
I can't imagine how frightening
this whole ordeal must be,

206
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:10,874
不过Beckett博士已经找到了你们其他队员
并且开始医治他们
but Dr. Beckett has reached the rest
of your team and begun to treat them.

207
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,836
现在, 你现在最应该做的就是返回去
Now, I think the best thing
for you to do is to head back.

208
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:19,632
如果Beckett证明你完全健康
我们保证你可以尽快回到城市中来
If Beckett gives you a clean bill of health, we'll make
sure you get back to the city as soon as possible.

209
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:26,848
你确信他能够听到么?
Are you sure he can hear me?

210
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:28,266
肯定
Positive.

211
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:31,227
你能让通过这些门更困难一些么?
Can you do anything to make it harder
to get through those doors?

212
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,271
我可以试试
I can try.

213
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,789
好了, 你看起来非常好
Well, you seem perfectly fine.

214
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,916
Dumais在她突然不好之前, 看起来也非常好
Well, Dumais seemed fine right up
to the point where she wasn't.

215
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,794
我已经让他们在走廊上搭了一小块地方
I've had them set up
a small field station down the corridor.

216
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,212
我们已经开始尸体解剖了
We've already started the autopsies.

217
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,213
有什么看法?
Any ideas?

218
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,964
从现在来看,
你一切都好, 所以我不会...
From what we can tell,
you're all in good shape, so I wouldn't...

219
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:02,217
不要再告诉我我一切都好了, Carson.
stop trying to convince me I'm fine, Carson.

220
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,510
我想我们更加了解
I think we all know better.

221
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,095
- 我只是想...
- 我们搞完了么?
- I was just trying to...
- Are we done here?

222
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:06,763
是的
224
Yes.

223
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,140
我要看看我可以从数据库中找到什么
I'm going to see what I can get from the database.

224
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,809
尸体解剖有什么结果, 马上告诉我
Let me know what the autopsy shows up.

225
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:11,810
好的
All right.

226
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,896
噢, 告诉你那些病理学家
从他们的头部开始
Oh, and tell your pathologists
to start with their heads.

227
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:48,138
必须有人做些什么
Someone has to do something.

228
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,806
我们正在做
We are doing something.

229
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:51,975
Grodin正在想办法限制门的控制...
Grodin's working on a plan to limit door controls...

230
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:54,310
这还不够好
必须有人去阻止他
That's not good enough.
Someone has to go out there and stop him.

231
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:55,603
我和Teyla已经准备好了
Teyla and I are ready.

232
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:56,479
少校, 我们已经...
Major, we've been...

233
00:14:56,521 --> 00:15:00,692
Peterson的想法很明显是错误的
他将会让城市中的所有人处于危险之中
Peterson obviously isn't thinking straight,
and he's endangering the entire population of the city.

234
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:02,944
我们现在仍然不知道我们所对付的病毒的习性
We don't yet know the nature
of the virus we're dealing with.

235
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:05,113
这仍然只是一个医学状况
This is still a medical situation.

236
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,115
我们没必要浪费时间了
我要出去了
We don't have time for this. I'm heading out.

237
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:08,491
Grodin, 封住体育馆.
Grodin, seal the gym.

238
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:15,915
这到底是怎么回事?
What the hell is this?

239
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:18,835
你自己说的
你是最高军事指挥官
You said so yourself.
You are the ranking military officer.

240
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:20,587
我不能让你有机会感染病毒
I can't chance you getting infected.

241
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:23,089
我不能让你有机会感染病毒. Bates?
I can't chance you getting infected. Bates?

242
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:23,965
是的, 长官
Yes, sir.

243
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:25,050
打开体育馆
Unlock the gym.

244
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,260
遵命, 长官
Yes, sir.

245
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:28,636
站住, Bates.
Stand down, Bates.

246
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,597
这里不归你做主, 少校.
You are not in command here, Major.

247
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,557
好吧, 我们少数服从多数
Well, we'll agree to disagree.

248
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:34,351
Bates, 把门打开
Bates, open the door.

249
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:37,562
不要
Don't.

250
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,064
Elizabeth, 他正朝你那边过来
Elizabeth, he's heading right for you.

251
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,273
所以我们一定要制止他
So we'll stop him.

252
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:41,775
我们会劝阻他, 我们会堵住他的路...
We'll talk him down, we'll block his way...

253
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:47,072
Bates中士, 我现在命令你立刻打开
体育馆到医学实验室之间所有的门
Sergeant Bates, I am ordering you to open up
the doors between the gym and the med lab right now.

254
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:56,706
我们准备出去
We're heading out.

255
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,636
对不起, 夫人
I'm sorry, Ma'am.

256
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:13,682
现在这都不要紧, 是么?
Doesn't really matter now, does it?

257
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:25,694
Beckett博士?
Dr. Beckett?

258
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,822
我已经有了最开始两位遇难者的初步解剖结果
I have the preliminary autopsy results
on the first two victims, Sir.

259
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,740
有什么值得关注的?
Anything of interest?

260
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:33,368
他们都死于大脑动脉瘤破裂
They both died of a ruptured saccular brain aneurysm,

261
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,912
这真是太不寻常了
which, in and of itself, isn't all that remarkable.

262
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:38,581
我的意思是, 两个站在一起的人
I mean, sure, the chances of two people
standing next to each other

263
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:41,042
同时死于这种原因在统计学上是不可能的
and dying of it is statistically improbable, yes,

264
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:44,546
不过这不是我们所希望的最终原因,
因为我知道你说过...
but it's not the smoking gun we were hoping for,
because I know you said...

265
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:46,381
直接说真正原因, Biro博士
Get to the good part, Dr. Biro.

266
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:47,465
对不起, 先生
Sorry, Sir.

267
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:50,885
真正引起我们关注的是
这两起动脉瘤的破裂
What's truly interesting
is that both ruptures happened

268
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:54,389
正巧都发生在相同的区域
刚好在视觉皮层
in exactly the same place,
right above the visual cortex.

269
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,516
那么第三个呢? Dumais?
And the third one? Dumais?

270
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:59,019
刚好轮到她了, 先生
Just getting to her now, sir.

271
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,270
我会告诉你的
I'll let you know.

272
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:01,855
她是说, "大脑动脉瘤," 对么?
She did say, "brain aneurysm," right?

273
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:02,939
是的
That's right.

274
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:05,275
这是我今天听到的最好的消息了
让我给你看些东西
That's the best news I've heard all day.
Let me show you something.

275
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:15,285
你本不应该在Bates中士面前破坏Weir博士的威信的
You should not have undermined Dr. Weir's
authority in front of sergeant Bates.

276
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:20,707
有时候, Elizabeth先作出了一个决定,
然后就困在那里面了    这就是问题
Sometimes, Elizabeth makes a decision
early on and gets locked into it. That's a problem.

277
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:25,462
她并不是唯一遭受这种苦恼的人
She is not the only one who suffers
from that affliction.

278
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:30,258
Weir博士, 我是Sheppard.
Dr. Weir, this is Sheppard.

279
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,385
我和Teyla已经准备好出去了
Teyla and I are ready to head out.

280
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,429
Peterson的位置在哪儿?
What's Peterson's location?

281
00:17:41,353 --> 00:17:43,355
Elizabeth
Elizabeth.

282
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:46,983
他在E-19区, 第三层
He's in section E-19, level three.

283
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:56,368
我们走
Let's head out.

284
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:38,284
我没有读完整个条目
因为它实在是太长了
I haven't read the entire entry
because it's incredibly long,

285
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:39,744
不过这看起来像我们这些家伙
but this looks like our guy.

286
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:42,747
六小时休眠
重复出现的幻觉, 然后, 在这之后,
Six-hour hibernation,
recurring visions, and, best of all,

287
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:46,167
我们最后...
大脑出血或者动脉瘤
so I've left it to last...
brain hemorrhage or aneurysms.

288
00:18:46,418 --> 00:18:48,294
这听起来非常熟悉
That definitely sounds familiar.

289
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,171
也许这里有讲如何...
Maybe there's something in here about how to...

290
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:55,760
不!
No!

291
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:04,686
抱歉
Sorry.

292
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,023
Rodney.
Rodney.

293
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:15,864
我刚才看见什么东西了
I've been seeing things.

294
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:18,825
从什么时候开始的?
Since when?

295
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:21,369
大约一个小时了
About an hour.

296
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:24,539
开始你会认为这只是你的眼睛在欺骗你, 不过最终...
First you think it's just your eyes
playing tricks on you, but eventually...

297
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:25,957
它们变得更糟
they get worse.

298
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:28,668
你也是?
You too?

299
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:31,463
他们直冲你过来
They come right at you.

300
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:36,426
看起来像鬼魂
It's like a ghost.

301
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:38,386
我已经去检查过了调查计划
I've been going over the survey schedule.

302
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:40,513
Johnson和Wagner从他们的位置出发
Johnson and Wagner started off on their own,

303
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:43,725
不过接着一小时后将穿过Dumais所经过的路线
but then crossed paths with Dumais an hour later.

304
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,605
Dumais差不多刚好在Johnson和Wagner之后一小时死去
Dumais died almost exactly
an hour after Johnson and Wagner.

305
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:51,107
他们接下来碰到的是谁?
Who did they meet up with next?

306
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:53,777
我现在最关心的是Dumais接下来碰到的是谁
My greater concern is who Dumais met up with next.

307
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:54,652
Dumais?
Dumais?

308
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:56,446
她碰到的是谁?
Who did she run into?

309
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:06,790
我
Me.

310
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:09,501
她碰到了Hays...
She ran into Hays...

311
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:11,127
和我
and me.

312
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:14,756
我们是下一波
We're next.

313
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,937
Peterson博士, 是你么?
Dr. Peterson, I presume?

314
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:31,106
我不会回到那去的
I'm not going back there.

315
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:32,732
你别无选择
You don't have much of a choice.

316
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:36,611
放松...
Easy...

317
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:41,241
我回到那去, 我就会被感染. 这是谋杀
I go back there, I get infected. That's murder.

318
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:43,368
一旦我们确定你没有受到感染
Once we ensure that you are not infected,

319
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,286
你会被允许返回城市
you will be allowed back into the city.

320
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:48,540
在那之前, 你对其他人来说都是一个威胁
Until then, you are a threat
to the rest of the population.

321
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,751
你不会朝自己人开枪的
You won't shoot a member of your own team.

322
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:54,796
Peterson, 你没被允许回到城市
Peterson, you will not be allowed
to go back to the city.

323
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:56,589
等等, 等等. 就等一会儿
Wait, wait. Just wait a second.

324
00:20:57,132 --> 00:21:01,136
把我带回医学实验室
把我隔离在那儿. 我可以自己过去.
Take me back to the med lab.
just quarantine me there. I'll go voluntarily.

325
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:03,430
求你了, 不要让我回到那去
Just, please, don't make me go back there.

326
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:11,354
事实上, 我很好. 我感觉非常好.
Really, I'm fine. I feel perfectly fine.

327
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:14,315
Weir博士, 我是Sheppard.
Dr. Weir, this is Sheppard.

328
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:19,279
Peterson已经同意回到医学实验室
直到我们搞定当前的情况
Peterson has agreed to go back to the med lab
until we can get the situation resolved.

329
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:20,739
站住!
Stop!

330
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:35,754
噢, 天哪!
Oh, my god!

331
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:36,921
他中枪了
He's been shot.

332
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:38,214
发生什么了?
What's going on?

333
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:02,614
发生什么了?
What's going on?

334
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,366
古人的控制器没有反映了
Ancient controls are unresponsive.

335
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:07,535
我接到报告Peterson已经被传送到了餐厅了
I'm getting reports that Peterson
transported into the mess hall.

336
00:22:07,744 --> 00:22:09,746
处于某种原因, 我们无法跟着他
For some reason, we can't follow him.

337
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:11,081
这个城市被接管了...
The city has taken over...

338
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,749
把我们投入一级防范状态
put us into a lockdown.

339
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:15,168
- 超驰自动控制
- 我做不到
- Override it.
- I can't.

340
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,962
Atlantis一定被设计用来可以自动应对疾病的爆发
Atlantis must be designed
to respond to outbreaks automatically.

341
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:21,257
当Peterson从东边传送出来时
城市的一级防范就被启动了
The city initiated a lockdown when Peterson
transported out of the east side.

342
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:22,217
为什么是现在?
Why now?

343
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:24,135
为什么不是当Johnson和Wagner被感染的时候?
Why not when Johnson and Wagner became infected?

344
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:27,681
那些区域的传感系统可能受到了洪水的影响
The city's detection systems might have been
affected by the flooding in those areas...

345
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:30,392
不过当Peterson进入餐厅时
But once Peterson entered the mess hall,

346
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:33,269
病原体几乎立刻就被自动系统检测到了
the pathogen was almost instantly
detected by automated systems,

347
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:35,271
城市立刻就开始保护自己
and the city protected itself.

348
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:39,275
好吧, 我现在有什么选择?
All right, what are my options?

349
00:22:39,693 --> 00:22:40,735
很少
Limited.

350
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,571
正如现在, 我们完全被隔离在主机之外了
As of now, we're completely
locked out of the mainframe.

351
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,834
这是真的么?
我将会死于脑动脉瘤
Is this really necessary?
I am about to die of a brain aneurysm.

352
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,711
装上心脏监视器有什么用?
How does being attached to a heart monitor help?

353
00:22:57,752 --> 00:23:00,338
如果你想其他人那样死去,
我们将会更清楚其中的过程.
If you die like the others,
we'll have a better idea of how.

354
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,298
这么说, 我就不在意了
At that point, I will cease to care.

355
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:04,676
还有很多其他人住在这个城市, 伙计
There are a lot of other people
that live in the city, man.

356
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:06,386
是的, 活着的
Yes, the living.

357
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:15,520
我本以为我们被锁死了
I thought we were in a lockdown.

358
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:17,230
那个门为什么为我们打开?
Why'd that open up for us?

359
00:23:19,774 --> 00:23:21,443
Weir, 我是Sheppard.
Weir, this is Sheppard.

360
00:23:21,735 --> 00:23:24,446
你现在可以把传送器联机么?
Were you able to get the transporters online or not?

361
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:26,489
看起来没有希望
It doesn't look promising.

362
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:30,994
Atlantis自己好像已经探测到了威胁
然后接管了大部分控制
Atlantis itself seems to have somehow sensed
a threat and taken over most of the controls.

363
00:23:31,536 --> 00:23:33,246
所以它关闭了传送器?
So it shut down the transporters?

364
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:34,456
是这样
That's right.

365
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:36,541
好吧, 我想我们应该考虑到这个
Well, I wish we would have thought of that.

366
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:39,085
我们确实考虑到了, 少校
We did think of that, Major.

367
00:23:39,336 --> 00:23:43,298
为了你们, 必须给整个区域供电
以打开通往Peterson的大门
That entire section had to be powered up
for you to open the door to Peterson.

368
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,799
事实上, 如果你们没有跟着他
In fact, if you hadn't gone after him,

369
00:23:44,883 --> 00:23:47,385
他也本可以不使用那些传送器的.
he wouldn't have been able to use the transporters.

370
00:23:49,763 --> 00:23:52,057
你现在还认为这是一个好主意么?
Do you still feel it was a good idea?

371
00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:54,559
传送器去了哪里?
Where'd he transport to?

372
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:55,894
餐厅
The mess hall.

373
00:23:56,019 --> 00:23:57,854
感谢上帝, 其他人都很尊重隔离
Thankfully, everyone else respected the quarantine.

374
00:23:57,979 --> 00:23:59,397
只有少数人在那里
There's only a handful of people there.

375
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:01,232
好了, 你已经说清楚了
All right, you've made your point.

376
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:02,859
你们赶快回到城市来
Make your way back to the city.

377
00:24:03,026 --> 00:24:05,612
在Beckett的实验室等进一步指示
Wait in Beckett's lab for further instructions.

378
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:12,452
Beckett博士?
Dr. Beckett?

379
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:13,995
有什么进展么, Biro博士?
Any progress, Dr. Biro?

380
00:24:14,037 --> 00:24:15,789
刚刚完成Dumais的尸体解剖
Just finished Dumais' autopsy.

381
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:18,124
如果告诉您她也死于动脉破裂, 您会感到奇怪么?
Would it surprise you to learn she died of a ruptured

382
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:20,251
视觉皮层的大脑动脉瘤, 先生?
brain aneurysm above the visual cortex, sir?

383
00:24:21,002 --> 00:24:22,712
不, 我不会奇怪
谢谢你, 博士
No, it wouldn't. Thank you, Doctor.

384
00:24:22,754 --> 00:24:23,838
不客气
Didn't think so.

385
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,383
血管破裂的位置可以解释那些幻觉
You know, the position of
the rupture could explain the visions.

386
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:28,677
在破裂之前, 那个区域的血流量猛增
Swelling in that area before the breakage

387
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:30,887
完全可以引起幻觉.
could absolutely account for the hallucinations.

388
00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:33,264
我不是医学博士, 不过大脑视觉皮层的血流量猛增
Look, I'm no M.D., but wouldn't brain
swelling on the visual cortex

389
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:36,643
就一定会引起色彩的混乱和奇怪的视觉?
just mean that we experience
washes of color or weird visual anomalies?

390
00:24:36,768 --> 00:24:37,936
这取决于个人
It would depend on the person.

391
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:39,187
Yeah, 这就是我要说的
Yeah, that's my point.

392
00:24:39,229 --> 00:24:40,480
所有的幻觉都是如此的接近
All of our visions are so similar.

393
00:24:40,522 --> 00:24:42,148
如果它们是动脉血流量猛增的结果
If they're the result of arterial swelling,

394
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:44,317
难道我们经历的视觉不会更随机一些么?
wouldn't the visions we experience be more random?

395
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:45,694
很可能是
Most likely.

396
00:24:45,735 --> 00:24:48,863
Yeah, 那好, 我们看到的东西几乎全是一样的
Yeah, well, the things we're seeing
are pretty damn identical.

397
00:24:49,197 --> 00:24:51,157
你想可能是有什么东西在起作用...
You think it might have
something to do with the nature...

398
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:57,414
Hays, 这不是真的. 记住, 这不是真的
Hays, it's not real. Remember, it's not real.

399
00:24:58,498 --> 00:25:02,335
他们正朝我们过来! 你看不见它们么?
They're coming right at us! Can't you see them?

400
00:25:04,087 --> 00:25:05,672
他的心率急剧上升, 不过那以后...
His heart rate's spiked, but aside from that...

401
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:08,133
不要说"好"! 他不好. 做点什么!
Don't say "fine!" He's not fine. Do something!

402
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:09,426
什么也做不了
There's nothing to do.

403
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:17,058
一, 二,
One, two,

404
00:25:17,225 --> 00:25:18,309
三, 四,
three, four,

405
00:25:18,476 --> 00:25:19,144
五...
five...

406
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:21,771
一, 二,
one, two,

407
00:25:21,896 --> 00:25:23,773
- 三, 四, 五
- 停
- three, four, five.
- Stop.

408
00:25:26,693 --> 00:25:27,902
不是他的心脏
It's not his heart.

409
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:30,488
...停
...stop.

410
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:52,010
你感觉怎么样?
How are you feeling?

411
00:25:54,804 --> 00:25:55,847
我...
I'm...

412
00:25:57,474 --> 00:25:58,558
我...
I'm...

413
00:26:00,977 --> 00:26:03,605
听着, 我有一个妹妹
Listen, I have a sister.

414
00:26:04,356 --> 00:26:06,566
- 我们并不亲近. 我甚至不知道你是否能找到她
- 不要说了
- We're not close. I don't even know how you'd find her.
- Don't talk like that.

415
00:26:06,608 --> 00:26:10,403
她是我真正拥有的唯一家人,
所以一定要有人告诉她发生了什么...
She's the only family I really have,
so someone should tell her what happened...

416
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:14,366
并让这一切听起来很好, 好么?
And make it sound good, okay?

417
00:26:14,908 --> 00:26:19,162
告诉她我是为了救人而死的... 救几个小孩
Tell her I died saving someone... kids.

418
00:26:19,329 --> 00:26:21,498
我因救几个小孩而死, 一群小孩...
I died saving kids, a bunch of them...

419
00:26:21,706 --> 00:26:26,670
另外, Zelenka, 我有一些理论
通过环接大门中的电源给用完的ZPM充电
And, Zelenka, I got some theories on looping
the power in the gate to charge a dummy ZPM.

420
00:26:26,711 --> 00:26:29,798
这可能并不能工作, 但你应该让人看看
因为这也有可能会导致其他的结果
It probably won't work, but you should have someone
look at it, because it might lead somewhere else.

421
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:31,257
我们会一起去看的
We'll look at it together.

422
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:33,843
你真的要中断我最后的思考么
You seriously have
to stop interrupting my last thoughts.

423
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:36,262
我的意思是, 刚才说的都非常重要
I mean, this is important stuff you need to hear.

424
00:26:41,935 --> 00:26:44,854
现在...如果你们在这里再多呆上一年
Now...if you're here for more than a year,

425
00:26:44,896 --> 00:26:46,856
我会留下一些笔记
关于如何进行应对电力不足
I've left some notes on how to roll blackouts

426
00:26:46,898 --> 00:26:49,401
来有效地维持你们的能源需求以及...
to effectively maintain your power requirements and...

427
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:53,822
告诉所有人我距离理论的统一只有咫尺之遥
Tell everyone that I was inches
away from a theory of unification,

428
00:26:53,947 --> 00:26:58,076
而那些笔记, 它们也将不再继续, 当我救那些...的时候
but the notes, they were lost when I died saving the...

429
00:26:58,493 --> 00:26:59,744
- 孩子
- 对
- kids.
- Yeah.

430
00:27:20,932 --> 00:27:22,392
我应该现在就死了
I should be dead now.

431
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:30,650
你是同时碰到Dumais的?
You ran into Dumais at the same time?

432
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:31,860
完全是同时
Exactly the same time.

433
00:27:31,901 --> 00:27:34,612
那么, 是的, 你应该死了
Then, yes, you should be dead.

434
00:27:36,656 --> 00:27:38,158
噢, 天哪
Oh, god.

435
00:27:42,996 --> 00:27:44,289
我仍然还活着
I'm still here.

436
00:27:44,414 --> 00:27:45,707
是的, 你还活着
Yes, you are.

437
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:49,878
有意思
Interesting.

438
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,588
有意思?
Interesting?

439
00:27:51,629 --> 00:27:53,131
不要想歪了, 不过...
Don't take this the wrong way, but...

440
00:27:53,173 --> 00:27:54,090
为什么?
why?

441
00:27:54,132 --> 00:27:55,383
正好
Exactly.

442
00:27:56,468 --> 00:27:57,719
什么, 我不介意
Well, I don't care.

443
00:27:59,262 --> 00:28:01,306
我是说, 我真的不介意
I mean, I really don't care.

444
00:28:10,565 --> 00:28:11,649
Weir博士?
Dr. Weir?

445
00:28:11,691 --> 00:28:12,734
是的, 少校?
Yes, Major?

446
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:19,657
我们已经到达城市了
We've reached the city.

447
00:28:20,033 --> 00:28:21,576
不过我们没有破坏城市的隔离
But we haven't hit the city's quarantine.

448
00:28:21,618 --> 00:28:23,119
你确信它把你锁在那里?
Are you sure it's locked you out?

449
00:28:23,161 --> 00:28:25,330
非常肯定. 我甚至不能进入我的办公室.
Pretty sure. I can't even get into my office.

450
00:28:25,413 --> 00:28:27,749
它到现在还没有给我们任何麻烦.
It hasn't giving us any trouble yet.

451
00:28:30,043 --> 00:28:32,003
防护服. 他们已经受到保护了
Hazmat suits. They're protected.

452
00:28:32,045 --> 00:28:32,879
什么?
What?

453
00:28:33,213 --> 00:28:36,549
这个城市一定能够感觉到他们没有感染的危险
The city must be capable of sensing
they're in no danger of infection.

454
00:28:37,008 --> 00:28:38,176
事实上, 这很有意义
It makes sense, actually.

455
00:28:38,218 --> 00:28:41,054
照这么说, Atlantis允许
受到保护的人去帮助受到感染的人
This way, Atlantis allows
protected personnel to assist the infected.

456
00:28:41,596 --> 00:28:43,640
如果是这种情况的话
我们应该可以去餐厅
If that is the case,
we should make our way to the mess hall.

457
00:28:43,682 --> 00:28:46,017
我想那里的每个人一定会非常恐惧和迷惑
I imagine everyone there will be
very scared and confused.

458
00:28:46,142 --> 00:28:46,935
同意
I agree.

459
00:28:47,102 --> 00:28:48,687
快去餐厅, 然后发回报告
Get to the mess hall and report back.

460
00:28:54,192 --> 00:28:56,236
你确信你想看这个么, Rodney?
Are you certain you really want to see this, Rodney?

461
00:28:56,403 --> 00:28:57,737
太精确了
It's too accurate.

462
00:28:57,862 --> 00:28:59,531
为什么有器官可以如此的高效?
How can something organic be that efficient?

463
00:28:59,656 --> 00:29:01,825
再说一遍, 我们在另一个星系的中央
Again, we're in the middle of another galaxy.

464
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,702
只是因为它跟我们平常不同
Just because it's out of the ordinary for us

465
00:29:03,743 --> 00:29:04,786
但这并不意味着它在这里就不平凡
doesn't mean it's not commonplace here.

466
00:29:04,828 --> 00:29:06,121
不, 不, 不, 我不认为这样
No, no, no, I don't buy that.

467
00:29:06,162 --> 00:29:07,914
我们迄今为止所遇到的大多数可居住的行星
Most of the habitable planets
we've encountered thus far

468
00:29:07,997 --> 00:29:10,792
都跟地球的环境条件非常相似
are carbon copies of earth in terms
of environmental conditions.

469
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:13,503
除非...
Unless...

470
00:29:13,753 --> 00:29:14,754
我就回来
I'll be back.

471
00:29:14,796 --> 00:29:16,006
怎么了, Rodney?
What's up, Rodney?

472
00:29:16,673 --> 00:29:18,967
潜伏直到完成需要刚好六个小时
Incubation to completion is exactly six hours.

473
00:29:19,342 --> 00:29:21,094
所有受到感染的人看到的幻觉都完全相同
The visions are identical for all the infected,

474
00:29:21,219 --> 00:29:24,764
而且每位死者的动脉瘤的位置都是完全一样
and the location of the aneurysm is
the same for every single deceased.

475
00:29:31,855 --> 00:29:33,565
你想我认为它是什么?
Is that what I think it is?

476
00:29:33,606 --> 00:29:38,028
这是纳米病毒, 每个都被造出来用以杀死人类
It's a nanovirus, one manufactured to kill humans.

477
00:29:45,618 --> 00:29:46,953
纳米病毒?
A nanovirus?

478
00:29:47,078 --> 00:29:47,912
对
That's right.

479
00:29:48,038 --> 00:29:50,290
OK, 告诉我这到底是什么
Okay, let's pretend I don't know exactly what that is.

480
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:54,753
纳米科技... 这是操作在纳米级的科技
Nano technology... it's technology
that operates on a nanite scale.

481
00:29:54,878 --> 00:29:56,671
大概是一米的十亿分之一
It's around a billionth of a millimeter.

482
00:29:56,838 --> 00:30:01,468
基本上, 它们是一些精微的机器
专门完成适合它们身材的非常特殊的任务
Basically, they're microscopic machines that are able
to carry out very specific tasks suited for their size.

483
00:30:01,509 --> 00:30:03,219
其结果是, 你可以吞下一枚药片
It's the whole idea of being able to swallow a pill

484
00:30:03,303 --> 00:30:05,972
然后成百万的小机器人投入工作
治愈折磨你的疾病
and having a million little robots
go to work and cure whatever ails you.

485
00:30:07,932 --> 00:30:10,643
你们都是被这种精微的机器感染了?
You're all infected with microscopic machines?

486
00:30:10,935 --> 00:30:12,979
是的, 它们比一个单细胞生物还要小
Yeah, they're no bigger than a single-celled organism,

487
00:30:13,104 --> 00:30:15,440
然而却有某一特定的作用, 如治疗疾病
although instead of having
a sole purpose of curing a disease

488
00:30:15,482 --> 00:30:16,524
或者修补血管...
or mending a blood vessel...

489
00:30:16,566 --> 00:30:18,777
这种病毒是被设计用来恐吓其受害者
The virus is programmed to terrorize its victims

490
00:30:18,818 --> 00:30:22,739
通过侵入他们的视觉皮层
然后让大脑中的一条动脉破裂
by tapping into their visual cortex
and then rupturing an artery in their brain.

491
00:30:22,947 --> 00:30:24,574
用同样的方法传染其他人
Infecting others along the way as they can.

492
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:25,700
它们是一种好东西
There's one good thing.

493
00:30:25,784 --> 00:30:27,160
我怀疑它们可以复制...
I doubt they can multiply...

494
00:30:27,243 --> 00:30:29,454
我不知道需要多少个才能杀死一个人
I don't know how many nanites
it takes to kill a human,

495
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:32,290
不过最后
我想它们太薄弱以致不能传播自己了
but eventually,
I imagine they'll spread themselves too thin.

496
00:30:33,792 --> 00:30:35,418
这可能是幽灵做的么?
Could it be Wraith?

497
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,504
我开头也这么想
That would definitely be my first guess.

498
00:30:37,545 --> 00:30:39,047
我不是很确信
I'm not so sure about that.

499
00:30:39,172 --> 00:30:41,466
不过那个幻觉, 那个尖叫的声音
你告诉我当他们...
But the visions, the shrill sound
you told me they make when they...

500
00:30:41,549 --> 00:30:42,842
我会告诉你它们也是同样可怕
I'll give you that they're equally terrifying,

501
00:30:42,926 --> 00:30:45,720
不过幽灵为什么制造一个同样恐怖的WMD呢?
but why would the Wraith even
create the equivalent of a WMD?

502
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:48,682
它们杀死我们并不是因为他们想把我们虐待致死
They're killing us not because
they sadistically want us dead,

503
00:30:48,765 --> 00:30:50,684
只是因为作为食物, 他们需要消耗我们
but because they need to consume us for food.

504
00:30:50,725 --> 00:30:55,689
瞧, 这就等同于养牛的农场主制造疯牛病. 我可不会去买
Look, it would be like the equivalent of cattle
farmers creating mad cow disease. I don't buy it.

505
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:58,149
你确实是从古人的实验室中发现这个的
You did come across it in an Ancient lab.

506
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:01,820
什么, 那么, 断绝幽灵的食物供给
是最后走投无路的想法?
What, so, wiping out the Wraith's food
supply is a last-ditch consideration?

507
00:31:01,986 --> 00:31:03,196
我从来不这么想
I don't believe that for a moment.

508
00:31:03,238 --> 00:31:04,989
古人绝对不会造出这种东西
The ancients would never create something like this.

509
00:31:05,031 --> 00:31:06,533
这也无法解释那个幻觉
That doesn't explain the visions, either.

510
00:31:06,616 --> 00:31:10,412
好吧, 现在, 谁制造了这个病毒
并不是我们现在所需要关注的
Okay, for the moment, who built the virus
is really the least of our concerns.

511
00:31:10,787 --> 00:31:12,122
说得好
Good point.

512
00:31:13,081 --> 00:31:15,583
我们需要搞清楚人是如何传播这个病毒的
We have yet to determine how one contracts the virus.

513
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:19,629
很可能你们都没有被感染
It is very possible that
none of you have been infected.

514
00:31:19,838 --> 00:31:21,297
那你为什么要穿防护服呢?
Then why are you in hazmat suits?

515
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:23,466
这只是预防措施
Just as a precaution.

516
00:31:24,259 --> 00:31:26,344
Sheppard少校, 我是McKay.
Major Sheppard, this is McKay.

517
00:31:26,553 --> 00:31:27,554
怎么了?
What is it?

518
00:31:27,595 --> 00:31:29,264
到我的实验室来, 我需要你帮忙
I could use your help at my lab.

519
00:31:31,224 --> 00:31:33,309
去吧. 我不会有事的.
Go. I will be fine.

520
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,941
我和Hays同时被感染
Hays and I were infected at the same time.

521
00:31:39,983 --> 00:31:42,068
只有一种可能可以解释为什么我可以存活下来
There's only one thing that explains why I survived.

522
00:31:42,193 --> 00:31:44,320
Rodney具有古人的基因, Hays却没有
Rodney has the ancient gene. Hays did not.

523
00:31:44,362 --> 00:31:45,947
但是Rodney不是古人
But Rodney's not an Ancient.

524
00:31:45,989 --> 00:31:48,450
对, 不过他曾经接种过A.T.A.基因
Aye, but he's been inoculated with the A.T.A. Gene.

525
00:31:48,825 --> 00:31:51,828
你是说这种病毒是被专门设计用来杀死人类的?
You're saying the virus
is designed to only kill humans?

526
00:31:52,037 --> 00:31:53,204
好吧, 我是人类
Well, I'm human.

527
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:53,913
是的, 是的
Yes, yes.

528
00:31:53,997 --> 00:31:55,373
我们有个想法, Rodney.
We're making a point, Rodney.

529
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:57,292
因此我们要给每个人进行基因治疗?
So we give everyone the gene therapy?

530
00:31:57,417 --> 00:31:58,793
不, 不准备这样做
No, that's not going to do it.

531
00:31:58,877 --> 00:32:00,170
我在几周以前就已经被给与了这种基因
I've already been given the gene weeks ago.

532
00:32:00,211 --> 00:32:01,296
但我没有带有
It didn't take.

533
00:32:01,338 --> 00:32:02,839
我知道. 我已经带有了
I know. I'm already on it.

534
00:32:03,048 --> 00:32:05,967
基因治疗只会在48%的接受者中起作用
The gene therapy is
only effective in 48% of recipients.

535
00:32:06,384 --> 00:32:07,677
如果我现在被注射基因
If I was given the gene shot right now,

536
00:32:07,844 --> 00:32:09,512
需要多久才可以奏效?
how long would it take to kick in?

537
00:32:09,804 --> 00:32:11,473
至少四个小时
A minimum of four hours.

538
00:32:11,931 --> 00:32:13,099
噢, 我没有四小时!
Well, I don't have four hours!

539
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:16,728
我在McKay和Hays碰到Dumais之后90分钟就遇到了他们
I met up with McKay and Hays
90 minutes after they met up with Dumais.

540
00:32:17,354 --> 00:32:20,565
我还有... 不到一个小时
我的大脑就会爆炸
I have... a little under an hour
before my brain explodes.

541
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:22,233
Hayden, 听我说
Hayden, listen to me.

542
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:24,277
你现在距离出事已经有20小时了
You've been up for almost 20 hours now.

543
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:26,237
不是你想的那回事
试图冷静一些
You're not thinking straight. Just try to stay calm.

544
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:27,072
冷静?
Calm?

545
00:32:27,489 --> 00:32:29,032
你告诉我我身体中有一百万个小机器人
You told me I have  a million tiny robots

546
00:32:29,199 --> 00:32:31,868
沿着我的血管在跑
它们唯一的目的就是恐吓我然后杀了我
running through my veins whose
only purpose is to terrorize and kill me.

547
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:32,952
你能冷静么?
You stay calm.

548
00:32:32,994 --> 00:32:34,579
你就要开始有幻觉了
We are about to have hallucinations.

549
00:32:34,954 --> 00:32:36,164
我们被感染了, Carson.
We are infected, Carson.

550
00:32:36,206 --> 00:32:37,540
我想我们都发作么?
How do you expect us to act?

551
00:32:38,833 --> 00:32:40,001
看来必须另寻出路
There's got to be another way.

552
00:32:40,043 --> 00:32:42,545
我已经告诉你了, 我正在努力
I've already told you, I am working on it.

553
00:32:45,924 --> 00:32:47,509
好吧, McKay. 我在这里
All right, McKay. I'm here.

554
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:48,468
你看见它没有?
Do you see it?

555
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:50,595
是房间中央的那个大东西么?
Is it the big thing in the middle of the room?

556
00:32:51,054 --> 00:32:52,097
是的, 就是那个
Yeah, that's the one.

557
00:32:52,681 --> 00:32:54,683
我要注意这些警告么?
Should I pay attention to all these warnings?

558
00:32:54,808 --> 00:32:56,267
不, 不需要
Not today, no.

559
00:32:58,812 --> 00:32:59,896
你要做什么?
What are you going to do?

560
00:32:59,938 --> 00:33:03,942
好吧, 只要它们还在这里
这些纳米机器人就会被计算机控制而运作
Well, as small as they are, the nanovirus is still
effectively just a machine run by a computer.

561
00:33:03,983 --> 00:33:06,486
而最好的停掉计算机的方法就是制造一个电磁脉冲
The best way to knock out a computer
is with an electromagnetic pulse.

562
00:33:06,528 --> 00:33:08,196
值得欣慰的是, 这个我们能够做到
Thankfully, that's something we can do.

563
00:33:12,826 --> 00:33:15,954
我们要关掉所有我们从地球上带来的电子设备
We're about through shutting down
all the electronic gear we brought from earth.

564
00:33:15,995 --> 00:33:18,164
我们仍然被锁在古人的控制器之外
We're still locked out of the Ancient controls, though.

565
00:33:18,206 --> 00:33:19,666
没有办法把它们都关掉
There's no way to power them down.

566
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:20,750
好吧, 那没有必要
Well, it's not going to be necessary.

567
00:33:20,792 --> 00:33:22,585
古人的技术跟我们的工作原理不同
The Ancient technology works differently than ours.

568
00:33:22,627 --> 00:33:24,921
一个E.M. 脉冲不会对它造成长期影响
An E.M. Pulse shouldn't have
any long-lasting effect on it.

569
00:33:25,505 --> 00:33:26,589
我们准备好了
We're ready.

570
00:33:28,425 --> 00:33:29,884
我们全都就绪了, Rodney.
We're all set, Rodney.

571
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:34,097
好的... 来吧
Okay... here we go.

572
00:33:34,139 --> 00:33:35,181
等等
Wait.

573
00:33:35,724 --> 00:33:37,267
我们怎么知道这可以奏效?
How will we know if it works?

574
00:33:37,308 --> 00:33:40,061
Sheppard将会拨出发电机所能够制造的最强大的脉冲
Well, Sheppard's dialing up the most
powerful pulse the generator can manage.

575
00:33:40,228 --> 00:33:41,479
这可能不会影响全部
It probably won't make it all the way down here,

576
00:33:41,521 --> 00:33:43,606
不过确实可以影响到大多数中央控制塔
but it should affect most of the central tower.

577
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:45,442
我想一旦病毒被消除掉了
I imagine once it wipes out the virus,

578
00:33:45,483 --> 00:33:48,903
城市将会解除锁定, 把控制权交还给你们
the city should return control
of it to you and end the lockdown.

579
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:50,155
在这没有用吧?
It won't make it here?

580
00:33:50,196 --> 00:33:53,575
如果脉冲奏效的话, 你将会到我的实验室中
If the pulse works, it'll simply be a matter
of walking you down to my lab,

581
00:33:53,616 --> 00:33:56,286
坐在EMP前面, 重复以上的过程
sitting you down in front of the EMP,
and repeating the process.

582
00:33:56,327 --> 00:33:57,370
少校?
Major?

583
00:33:57,704 --> 00:33:59,831
开始工作了. 我应该什么时候按下放电按钮?
It's working. When I should hit the discharge button?

584
00:34:00,123 --> 00:34:02,625
嗯, 应该有一个红色的过载指示灯
Okay, there should be a red overload light.

585
00:34:06,921 --> 00:34:08,173
好的, 我看见了
Yeah, I see it.

586
00:34:08,298 --> 00:34:11,259
等到它亮起, 数十下, 然后放电
Wait till it comes on,
give it a good 10-count, and then discharge.

587
00:34:12,552 --> 00:34:13,595
数十下?
A 10-count?

588
00:34:13,636 --> 00:34:14,554
别担心
Don't worry.

589
00:34:14,596 --> 00:34:16,431
我可能比其他任何人在EMP前待的时间都长
I've probably been around more EMPs than anyone.

590
00:34:16,473 --> 00:34:17,390
这会...
This is going to be...

591
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:19,768
会没事的, 对么?
going to be fine, right?

592
00:34:19,851 --> 00:34:21,519
是的, 没事的
Yes, that's a yes.

593
00:34:21,644 --> 00:34:23,021
你会没事的
You'll be fine.

594
00:35:00,475 --> 00:35:01,518
有效果么?
Anything?

595
00:35:01,643 --> 00:35:03,103
这是不是要等一段时间?
Is it possible it might take some time?

596
00:35:04,396 --> 00:35:05,647
可能吧
Doubtful.

597
00:35:10,318 --> 00:35:12,195
你仍然无法进入古人的主机?
Are you still locked out of the Ancient mainframe?

598
00:35:19,077 --> 00:35:20,495
还有其他办法么?
Got any other ideas?

599
00:35:28,461 --> 00:35:30,338
29分钟
29 minutes.

600
00:35:44,936 --> 00:35:46,813
这没有用, 这没有用
It didn't work. It didn't work.

601
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,148
仍然没有清除干净
It is still unclear.

602
00:35:48,189 --> 00:35:49,065
什么没有干净?
What's unclear?

603
00:35:49,107 --> 00:35:50,567
要么它有效, 要么就没有
Either it worked or it didn't.

604
00:35:50,608 --> 00:35:51,943
他们正在试图找出...
They are trying to determine...

605
00:35:54,279 --> 00:35:55,321
他们到处都是!
They're everywhere!

606
00:35:55,488 --> 00:35:57,782
你正在经历一场幻觉.
You are experiencing a hallucination.

607
00:36:13,506 --> 00:36:14,799
噢, 我的天哪
Oh, my god.

608
00:36:20,555 --> 00:36:22,557
我已经试过了. 这没有用
I've already tried that. It's blown.

609
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:24,851
那是在我们重置子开关之前
That is before we reset the sub-switch.

610
00:36:24,893 --> 00:36:27,187
好吧, 也许我们不应该过载那么多
Well, maybe we shouldn't have overloaded it so much.

611
00:36:27,437 --> 00:36:29,147
这是固定的, 这是固定的
Look, it's fixable. It's fixable.

612
00:36:29,189 --> 00:36:30,857
我们只是需要使用一点点尝试和错误
We just need to use a little trial and error.

613
00:36:30,899 --> 00:36:32,400
即使我们让这东西工作起来
Look, even if we get this thing working,

614
00:36:32,484 --> 00:36:34,486
谁能够说脉冲可以获得更大呢?
who's to say the pulse is going to get any bigger?

615
00:36:34,611 --> 00:36:37,864
好吧, Ford和Zelenka只剩下20分钟了
All right, Ford and Zelenka have 20 minutes
before their arteries rupture.

616
00:36:43,661 --> 00:36:46,081
你确信EMP会杀死这东西?
Are you sure an EMP will kill this thing?

617
00:36:47,582 --> 00:36:48,625
是的
Yes.

618
00:36:49,042 --> 00:36:50,710
好吧, 我有一个主意
All right, I have an idea.

619
00:36:58,301 --> 00:36:59,844
你这是什么意思, "不"?
What do you mean, "no"?

620
00:37:00,136 --> 00:37:01,388
这太危险了
It's too dangerous.

621
00:37:02,055 --> 00:37:04,307
你想我们当中三分之一的人死去么?
You'd rather lose a third of our population?

622
00:37:04,349 --> 00:37:05,517
我们还没到那个地步, 少校
We're not there yet, Major.

623
00:37:05,558 --> 00:37:06,726
我们已经到了!
We are there!

624
00:37:06,935 --> 00:37:08,603
Ford和Zelenka就是下一波了
Ford and Zelenka are next.

625
00:37:08,645 --> 00:37:10,772
餐厅中的人只有三个小时多一点时间了
The people in the mess hall have
a little over three hours.

626
00:37:10,814 --> 00:37:12,607
这是一次完全的爆发
This is a full-blown outbreak.

627
00:37:12,649 --> 00:37:15,151
如果我们不这样做, 就会不断有人死去
People are going to keep dying unless we do this.

628
00:37:15,276 --> 00:37:17,696
即使我们把EMP发电机重新联机
Even if we were able to get
the EMP generator back online,

629
00:37:17,862 --> 00:37:20,782
我们让它足够强大的机会也是微乎其微
the chances are slim that we would
ever be able to get it powerful enough.

630
00:37:20,949 --> 00:37:22,909
我们不能把受感染的人带到发电机那里去么?
Can we bring the infected to the generator?

631
00:37:22,951 --> 00:37:23,952
不能
We can't.

632
00:37:23,993 --> 00:37:26,746
城市不会让受到感染的人通过任何一道门
The city won't let infected personnel
through any of the doors.

633
00:37:26,871 --> 00:37:28,331
少校是对的
The major is right.

634
00:37:28,456 --> 00:37:31,418
唯一可以制造足以消灭这些家伙的EMP的办法就是...
The only way to create an EMP
strong enough to wipe these little guys out is...

635
00:37:31,543 --> 00:37:33,878
在大气中引爆一次核爆炸
to detonate a nuclear explosion in the atmosphere, yes.

636
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,963
我还是第一次听说
I heard the first time.

637
00:37:35,005 --> 00:37:36,715
我知道这听起来很严重
I know it sounds severe,

638
00:37:36,923 --> 00:37:41,302
不过如果少校可以在离城市20英里远的地方引爆
but if the major was able to overload
a naquadah generator 20 miles above the city,

639
00:37:41,344 --> 00:37:43,680
从发射学的立场看, 我们是非常安全的
we'd be perfectly safe from a radiological standpoint,

640
00:37:43,722 --> 00:37:47,559
并且可以保证爆炸能够制作一个
具有强大破坏力的电磁冲击波
and the ensuing blast would be capable of creating
a devastating electromagnetic shock wave.

641
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,477
足够消除这些病毒
Definitely enough to knock this virus out.

642
00:37:49,561 --> 00:37:52,313
希望不要摧毁我们自己的计算机设备
Hopefully without destroying
all our own computer equipment.

643
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,524
这值得冒一下险
It's worth the risk.

644
00:37:58,653 --> 00:38:01,072
好吧, 你可以出发了
Okay, you have a go.

645
00:38:35,899 --> 00:38:37,108
我已经就位了
I'm almost in position.

646
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,443
明白
Understood.

647
00:38:38,818 --> 00:38:41,237
E.M.脉冲对飞船会有什么影响么?
Will the E.M. Pulse have any
effect on the puddle jumper?

648
00:38:41,279 --> 00:38:42,447
希望没有
I'm hoping not.

649
00:38:42,489 --> 00:38:44,908
无论如何, 我还是担心冲击波
Either way, I'm more worried about the shock wave.

650
00:38:45,367 --> 00:38:46,409
祝你好运
Good luck.

651
00:38:46,618 --> 00:38:47,869
你也是
You too.

652
00:38:48,161 --> 00:38:50,705
在你放出它之后, 你只有30秒钟逃命
You're only going to have 30 seconds
once you release it before it explodes.

653
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:52,665
你需要尽可能飞远一些
You need to get as far away as you can.

654
00:38:52,707 --> 00:38:56,628
离核爆炸越远越好
Get as far away from
the nuclear explosion as possible.

655
00:38:57,462 --> 00:38:59,506
这是个好建议, Rodney. 多谢
That's good advice, Rodney. Thanks.

656
00:38:59,756 --> 00:39:00,840
不客气
You're welcome.

657
00:39:00,882 --> 00:39:02,634
我准备释放发生器了...
I'm releasing the generator...

658
00:39:03,885 --> 00:39:05,136
现在
now.

659
00:39:14,104 --> 00:39:16,022
25秒后引爆
Detonation in 25 seconds.

660
00:39:19,901 --> 00:39:21,152
20 秒...
20 seconds...

661
00:39:24,989 --> 00:39:26,408
15 秒...
15 seconds...

662
00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:31,079
10 秒后引爆...
detonation in 10...

663
00:39:31,371 --> 00:39:34,332
9, 8, 7...
nine, eight, seven...

664
00:39:34,541 --> 00:39:35,709
6...
six...

665
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:36,918
5...
five...

666
00:39:37,085 --> 00:39:40,422
4, 3, 2...
four, three, two...

667
00:39:40,588 --> 00:39:41,673


one.

668
00:40:01,234 --> 00:40:02,694
Sheppard少校, 请回答
Major Sheppard, come in.

669
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:06,239
我是Weir. 请回答
This is Weir. Please respond.

670
00:40:06,364 --> 00:40:08,867
通讯可能会受到爆炸的干扰
Communications may have been disrupted by the blast.

671
00:40:11,244 --> 00:40:12,579
少校, 能听到么?
Major, do you read me?

672
00:40:26,009 --> 00:40:27,052
我是Sheppard.
This is Sheppard.

673
00:40:27,469 --> 00:40:29,054
我已经从爆炸中出来了
I've cleared the blast.

674
00:40:29,346 --> 00:40:30,805
我正在回家的途中
I'm returning home.

675
00:40:33,516 --> 00:40:34,726
很高兴听到你的声音, 少校
Glad to hear it, Major.

676
00:40:34,768 --> 00:40:35,852
奏效了么?
Did it work?

677
00:40:35,894 --> 00:40:37,354
我们正在检查
We're about to find out.

678
00:40:42,942 --> 00:40:44,235
我们应该马上就可以知道
We should know almost right away.

679
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:47,447
脉冲只持续了两微秒...
The pulse only lasts a couple of microseconds...

680
00:40:47,489 --> 00:40:49,491
城市已经回到我们手中了, Rodney.
The city is already ahead of us, Rodney.

681
00:40:49,574 --> 00:40:51,868
你可以放心回来了
You have a green light to return.

682
00:40:55,872 --> 00:40:56,706
你还好吧?
You all right?

683
00:41:11,971 --> 00:41:13,223
还好吧?
You okay?

684
00:41:14,015 --> 00:41:16,309
是的, 只是一个小核弹. 没有什么, 真的.
Yeah, just a little nuke. Nothin', really.

685
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:19,187
这个计划真是聪明
The naquadah generator plan was very clever.

686
00:41:19,354 --> 00:41:21,106
- 干得好
- 谢谢你
- Good work.
- Thank you.

687
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,733
现在我要去睡觉了
Now I'm going to bed.

688
00:41:24,859 --> 00:41:27,195
我们需要讨论一下早先发生的事情
We need to discuss what happened earlier.

689
00:41:27,779 --> 00:41:28,738
现在?
Now?

690
00:41:32,909 --> 00:41:34,994
以后再也不能发生了类似的事情了
That can never happen again.

691
00:41:37,122 --> 00:41:38,957
我很抱歉...
Look, I'm sorry about...

692
00:41:39,082 --> 00:41:41,418
我了解你在处理军事事务中的经验
I understand your expertise in military matters,

693
00:41:41,543 --> 00:41:45,630
并且我也同意我应该在
类似的情况中推迟这些经验的实施...
and I agree that I should defer
to those expertise in such situations...

694
00:41:45,714 --> 00:41:46,798
谢谢
Thank you.

695
00:41:47,007 --> 00:41:51,344
不过你还不是那个判断到底是不是军事状况的那个人
But you are not the one who decides what is
and what is not a military situation.

696
00:41:52,137 --> 00:41:54,139
O'Neill将军和Sumner上校
Now, both general O'Neill and colonel Sumner

697
00:41:54,222 --> 00:41:56,975
都曾经警告过我你并不是非常尊重上级的命令
warned me that you don't respect
the proper chain of command.

698
00:41:57,017 --> 00:41:59,602
有些时候, 我所看到的情况跟你稍微一点不同
Sometimes, I see a situation
a little different than you.

699
00:41:59,686 --> 00:42:01,229
不, 听我说, John
No, listen to me, John.

700
00:42:01,479 --> 00:42:04,566
如今, 你把你自己和很多其他人的生命推入险境
Now, you endangered yourself
and the lives of many others.

701
00:42:04,691 --> 00:42:07,819
因为我认为到了采取行动的最佳时机了
Because I thought it was
the best course of action to take,

702
00:42:07,902 --> 00:42:09,654
而且, 顺便说一句, 我救了你的命
and, by the way, I saved your ass.

703
00:42:09,696 --> 00:42:10,905
我知道你所做的...
I know you did...

704
00:42:12,198 --> 00:42:14,576
不过你必须相信我
but you have to trust me.

705
00:42:16,202 --> 00:42:17,412
我相信
I do.

706
00:42:17,495 --> 00:42:18,580
是么?
Do you?

707
00:42:18,955 --> 00:42:20,206
你们有时间么?
You guys have a minute?

708
00:42:20,457 --> 00:42:24,294
我们可以花些时间来研究那些纳米病毒样品了
We've been able to spend some
quality time with the nanovirus samples.

709
00:42:24,336 --> 00:42:26,963
据我们所知, 它们全部已经失去能力了
From what we can tell,
they've all been incapacitated.

710
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:28,590
好啊, 这是个好消息
Well, that's good news.

711
00:42:28,631 --> 00:42:30,842
是的, 另外, 根据进一步的研究
Yes, also, upon further investigation,

712
00:42:30,884 --> 00:42:33,053
我想我们可以排除它们是由幽灵制造的可能性了
I think we can rule out that
they were created by the Wraith.

713
00:42:33,345 --> 00:42:35,764
他们跟我们以前碰到的任何幽灵的科技都不相同
They're different than any Wraith technology
we've come across thus far.

714
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:37,390
如果不是幽灵...
If not the Wraith...

715
00:42:38,683 --> 00:42:39,934
那么是谁制造了他们?
then who made them?

716
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:42,270
老实说我也不知道
I honestly don't know.

717
00:42:42,937 --> 00:42:46,316
不管它们是谁, 只希望他们不要在周围
Whoever they were, let's just hope
that they're not still around.

718
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:51,404
但愿吧


Let's hope.
