1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:03,740
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,650
After five years on a hellish island,

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,660
I have come home with only one goal...

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,450
to save my city.

5
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:16,130
But to do so,I can't be the killer I once was.

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,990
To honor my friend's memory,I must be someone else.

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,450
I must be something else.

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,750
Previously on "Arrow"...

9
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:30,240
This one's no longer of use to us.

10
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:31,750
Wait.He could still be useful.

11
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:32,770
She's right.

12
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,200
Once we get rid of his friends,we'll need him to lead us to the grave.

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,900
You're going back to the island.

14
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:40,000
Look,you already lost your dad.

15
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,210
Your mom,she's still here.

16
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,660
And I'm sure she'd love to see you.

17
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,570
I'm not going to that prison.

18
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,780
It's the only way I know how to hurt her.

19
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:48,310
And I want to hate you.

20
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:50,930
But I can't.

21
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,440
I didn't think that there were secrets kept between us.

22
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:58,120
Mom...what are you hiding?

23
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,420
My name is Moira Dearden Queen.

24
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:06,630
I am the acting CEO of Queen Consolidated.

25
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:09,600
And,God forgive me,I have failed this city.

26
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:15,890
I have been complicit in an undertaking with one horrible purpose...

27
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:23,010
to destroy the Glades and everyone in it.

28
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:27,530
If you reside in the Glades,please,you need to get out now.

29
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,040
Your lives and the lives of your children depend on it.

30
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,270
Please.

31
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:35,560
Warden says we got to evacuate.

32
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:39,100
Help me get these out of here.

33
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,510
What about the inmates?

34
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,920
Leave 'em.

35
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,490
Over here,let me out.

36
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,810
No.Give me the keys!

37
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:38,110
No,no,too violent.Too Sloppy,too stupid.

38
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,980
Too...ambitious.

39
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,010
You.

40
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,130
I love your work.

41
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,990
Big future.

42
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,280
Hey,be careful.

43
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,400
There's liable to be aftershocks.

44
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,210
Oh,I'm counting on it.

45

48
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,120
Mr.Queen,what are your mother's chances?

49
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,840
Is she on suicide watch?

50
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,360
Mr.Queen,can you give us any comment?

51
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,680
It's not fair.

52
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:37,830
They're not the ones on trial.

53
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:41,410
That won't stop Jean Loring from using them as props to drum up sympathy.

54
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,820
You don't seem overly concerned.

55
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,590
She confessed to being an accomplice on live television.

56
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,270
Also sad that Malcolm Merlyn coerced here.

57
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,320
You have something,don't you?

58
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,280
I thought I was your co-counsel,Adam.

59
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,330
If you're holding a trump card,don't you think maybe you should share it with me?

60
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,170
It's going to be a good trial.

61
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,170
Come on,let's get inside.

62
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,400
You don't have to do this.

63
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:14,540
Ivo says we do.

64
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,850
Your friends are a danger to his men.

65
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,500
Go.Quick and quiet.

66
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,370
Slade!Shado!Run!

67
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,790
There's no one here.

68
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:38,620
They must have moved on from their position.

69
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,770
Chargers are placed.Here's the detonator.

70
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,460
Make sure they have no place to return to.

71
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,700
Go.

72
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,140
And you.

73
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,230
Now you're going to take us to the graves.

74
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:52,450
Let's go.Get him up.

75
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,380
Let's get clear.

76
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,340
Did you find the detonator?

77
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,220
Yes.

78
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,800
We were lucky.

79
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,720
I was lucky.

80
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,370
You were good.

81
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,130
Either way...

82
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,290
They have Oliver.

83
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:16,870
I'm going after him.

84
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,140
Not alone.

85
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,630
You can barely walk.

86
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,960
All the more reason not to stay here.

87
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,680
Give them another chance at blowing me up.

88
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:35,720
Are you two ok?

89
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,010
I should be asking you that question.

90
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:37,950
I'll be fine.

91
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,410
You look like you have the flu.

92
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,140
If that's true,I shouldn't have wasted my time getting vaccinated.

93
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,980
Diggle,whatever it is,just go home.

94
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,940
Oliver,listen,I can take care of things.

95
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,880
No,we'll be fine,all right?

96
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,000
Go rest.And don't make me call a cop.

97
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,980
There are a few of them around here.

98
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:24,750
...have been complicit in an undertaking with one horrible purpose...

99
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:28,490
to destroy the Glades and everyone in it.

100
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,720
And it worked.

101
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,130
The Glades were destroyed.

102
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,130
Homes and lives were lost.

103
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,350
All because of her actions.

104
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:41,830
True,she had second thoughts; Remorse which compelled her to deliver this statement.

105
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,840
But on behalf of the 503 lives that were extinguished that day,

106
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:49,870
I say,Moira Queen,your remorse comes too late.

107
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:56,210
For the last five years,under the threat for my life and the lives of my family...

108
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,280
Why wouldn't those threats silence her?

109
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,460
Why wouldn't Moira Queen be terrified?

110
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:06,280
Malcolm Merlyn killed her first husband,abducted her second.

111
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,600
Why wouldn't she be in fear for her life?

112
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,660
For the lives of her children?

113
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,160
What would you do?

114
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:17,200
If it were your children in the crosshairs of a mad man's rage?

115
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:25,650
S.T.A.R.Lab's particle accelerator will be turned on right on schedule.

116
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,690
In other news,we have just received word

117
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:32,250
that both sides have now completed their opening statements in the Moira Queen trial.

118
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,500
Don't take this the wrong way,but you look disgusting.

119
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,630
Yeah,well,I don't feel great,Felicity.

120
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,140
Is there a right way to take that?

121
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:40,890
You should go home.

122
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,460
I am going.

123
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,610
I just need to make arrangements for a replacement bodyguard.

124
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,030
Did you get the flu shot?

125
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:49,020
Personally,I never do.I know that I should.

126
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,590
I just,I have this thing about needles.

127
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,280
All pointy things,really.

128
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,340
Which is ironic,considering who we work with.

129
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,590
Yeah,it's not the flu,Felicity,it's more like...

130
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,880
Dig!

131
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,700
Hello?

132
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,440
Are you here?

133
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,090
Here...

134
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,530
there...

135
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,050
everywhere.

136
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:14,740
So.How goes our little science project?

137
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,030
Working like you said it would.

138
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,790
How wonderful.

139
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,220
Ah,so listen.

140
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,380
Doing the thing was 50,000.

141
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,120
Keeping quiet about it,I'm thinking it should be 50 more.

142
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,340
Oh,I want word to spread.

143
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,740
It's kind of the whole objective,actually.

144
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,710
You see my point?

145
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:43,350
You should know,I find post hoc negotiation...

146
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:44,950
distasteful.

147
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:51,490
Such a shame you won't get to see what your works have wrought,doctor.

148
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:54,460
But soon,everyone else will.

149
00:08:55,350 --> 00:09:00,210
And they'll beg for it to end.

150
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,190
What the hell are you doing here?

151
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:11,930
I heard you passed out.

152
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,150
I told Felicity not to call you.

153
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:16,480
Yeah,but before that,you said "gaw" and "thud," so I didn't take it very seriously.

154
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:19,040
She was right to call me.Diggle,you need medical attention.

155
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:20,350
He needs more than that.

156
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:23,070
When Dig passed out,I sent a sample of his blood to a chemist I know at QC.

157
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,850
The guy owes me a favor.Long story,I fixed his parking ticket.

158
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,850
Huh.I guess it's not that long.

159
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,940
Felicity.The blood sample.

160
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,960
Yeah.It came back positive...

161
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:33,470
for trace amounts of Vertigo.

162
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,930
I never used Vertigo before in my life.

163
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,360
You were exposed to it somehow.

164
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,730
Vertigo's in play again?

165
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:41,580
When the Count recovered from his OD on Vertigo,he was sent to Iron Heights.

166
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,520
That got hit in the quake.

167
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,370
He got out the same way the Doll Maker did?

168
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,010
And just like with the Doll Maker,

169
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,170
prison officials worked overtime to keep the lid on the escape.

170
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,040
I know what you're thinking.

171
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:58,380
No,you don't.

172
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:00,820
I made a choice not to put an arrow in this guy.

173
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,700
And it was the right choice.

174
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,400
There's no more killing.

175
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:08,380
I worked this up to counteract the effects of Vertigo.

176
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,920
Give it to Diggle.I...

177
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,980
I need to get back to court.

178
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,910
While I'm gone,just work up whatever you can

179
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,530
and figure out how Diggle got Vertigo in his system without his knowledge.

180
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,180
Ok.Go.

181
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:26,060
When was the first time you heard about this so-called Undertaking?

182
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:29,940
When everyone else did,when my mother gave the press conference.

183
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:31,610
Doesn't seem like you took it too well.

184
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,150
I was surprised.

185
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,980
Who wouldn't be?

186
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:42,610
Uh,your mother was,um,immediately take into custody,

187
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,020
but I assume you went down to the precinct to see her?

188
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:48,250
Um,actually I didn't see her until she was moved.

189
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,630
To the prison.

190
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:52,750
Do you remember when you visited her?

191
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,710
Uh,not the exact date.

192
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:58,070
It's ok,I have the visitor log here.

193
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,840
October ninth.

194
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,500
Five months later.

195
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,420
Why so long?

196
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,420
Um,I...I...

197
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,490
Are you ok?

198
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,510
An answer,please.

199
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,060
Why did it take you five months to visit your mother?

200
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,270
Your Honor,if I...

201
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,940
No.I want to hear this.

202
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,440
I needed time.

203
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,070
I was...

204
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:24,220
Angry.

205
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:28,640
So angry,perhaps,that it took you five months to forgive her?

206
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,650
It was complicated.

207
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,290
No.It's very simple.

208
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:35,970
You blamed your mother for what she had done.

209
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,320
So why shouldn't the jury?

210
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:47,100
Your Honor,we have no further questions for the...witness.

211
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,560
Adam!

212
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,100
Where is it?

213
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:02,990
Come on,where is it?!

214
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,030
The Hosen,where is it?

215
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,260
- What? - The arrowhead.

216
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:12,200
Every report said it was with these bodies.

217
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,050
You said you and your friends were here.

218
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,550
Now,where is it?

219
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,090
Take him outside.

220
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,010
Make him show you where his friends are hiding.

221
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,560
Take us to them.

222
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,570
I don't know where they are!

223
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,570
Tell me,or you lose your hand.

224
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:36,600
Let us suggest another option.

225
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:40,320
You hand the kid over to us,and we don't kill you all.

226
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:52,060
Hey,are you ok?

227
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,100
Don't worry about me.

228
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,440
I can take it.

229
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,520
Was that as bad as it seemed?

230
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,980
Thea's testimony?

231
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,410
It was a set-back.

232
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:23,910
We were counting on her to... Humanize me.

233
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,310
Frankly,yes.

234
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,220
And now we're going to have to go another way.

235
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,640
No. No,I told you,I won't testify.

236
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:30,710
I know you did.

237
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,340
But now you have to.

238
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,780
She's right,Mom.

239
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,510
Jean,can you give us a minute?

240
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,710
Yeah.

241
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,440
I know what you're going to say.

242
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,740
But if I testify,it will destroy our family.

243
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,830
And if your lawyer's right,you don't have a choice.

244
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:55,600
Mom,secrets are what put you in this situation.

245
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,070
Secrets and lies.

246
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,860
And now it is time to give the truth its day.

247
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:10,420
Now,I don't want us to lose sight of the other major event in court today.

248
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:13,490
Was there any indication of Adam Donner being ill?

249
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:17,590
No,there was very little warning before Mr.Donner collapsed to the ground.

250
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,200
I've spoken to several people that were in the courtroom with me...

251
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,580
How are you feeling?

252
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:24,530
Fine.

253
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,930
You have a lousy poker face,Diggle.

254
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,520
Did he take the antidote?

255
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,580
Didn't work.

256
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,230
The Count must have futzed with his recipe.

257
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,600
Heard what happened with Donner at the court,and with Thea.

258
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,950
How is she?

259
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,500
Going to be fine.

260
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:39,590
Your poker face isn't much better than mine,Oliver.

261
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,710
Hello,Starling City.

262
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,040
Felicity!

263
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,500
Miss me?

264
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,830
Many of you have noticed that you're not feeling quite like yourselves...

265
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,310
He's taken over all the local station feeds.

266
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,390
Track his signal.

267
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,860
Like our good assistant district attorney here.

268
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:59,390
You might recognize him from his work in the ongoing Moira Queen trial.

269
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,130
Hi,Adam.

270
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,440
What do you want?

271
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:03,910
I want what you want.

272
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,220
For you to feel better.

273
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,870
Go to hell!

274
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:13,150
I do think you want the pain to end,and I can do that...

275
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,840
With Vertigo.

276
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:19,350
It's what all of your bodies crave.

277
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:22,360
Fortunately,the power of relief is right here.

278
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:27,020
And all you have to do is go to your friendly neighborhood Vertigo dealer and request the cure.

279
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:29,300
Simply supply and demand at work.

280
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:34,670
Now,tell me you want this and it's yours.

281
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:37,070
All the pain will just...

282
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:38,810
disappear.

283
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,970
Say it.

284
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,570
Say...

285
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,310
You want it.

286
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:53,250
I-I...want...I want it.

287
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,060
You see...

288
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,960
a simple solution.

289
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:07,720
I'm Count Vertigo,and I approve this high.

290
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:12,780
What do we do now?

291
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:15,190
We find him...

292
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,060
And we shut him down.

293
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,730
Where did he broadcast from?

294
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:30,240
He bounced the signal off of S.T.A.R.Lab's satellite.

295
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:31,880
He could have sent that transmission from Markovia.

296
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,140
He would want to stay local.

297
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,620
Scrub the footage,frame by frame if you have to.

298
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,940
There's something on here that gives us a clue to where he is.

299
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:41,120
If he dosed the whole city,why are only some people showing symptoms?

300
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,550
Maybe exposure was selective.

301
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:45,940
The Count contaminated something that only certain people,like you and Donner,consumed.

302
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,320
A most dramatic turn.

303
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:55,000
City officials are urging calm,hoping to avoid widespread panic.

304
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,480
Deputy Mayor Levitz has...

305
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:59,940
The Count has turned Starling into a city of junkies.

306
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,720
Any leads on where he's holding ADA Donner?

307
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,550
Hmm,no.

308
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,080
As cold as it sounds,I've got other concerns.

309
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,350
Laurel?

310
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,530
Adam's trial notes are very thorough.

311
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,680
They better be.

312
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:12,940
You're lead counsel now.

313
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,200
Ms.Spencer,you're the district attorney.

314
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:17,740
Yes,but you're the one that the jury knows.

315
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:24,410
You'll do fine,Laurel.

316
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:25,740
I know.

317
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:28,700
I just found Adam's trump card.

318
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:44,110
Sorry,I didn't hear you walk up.

319
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,600
I just want to be left alone.

320
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,500
Well,too bad that's not an option for you.

321
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:49,420
But maybe I know something that is.

322
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,290
Hit me.

323
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,800
What?

324
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:05,010
You wonder why I used to go out at night looking to throw down with bad guys.

325
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:08,570
Part of it was to help the city.

326
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:12,400
And the other part was to help me.

327
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,690
Getting tuned up by street thugs helped you?

328
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,580
Yeah,well,I gave as good as I got.

329
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,690
There we go.

330
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,830
When I would throw a punch,I'd be so angry.

331
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:28,230
I'd feel this heat rising inside of me,in my jaw.

332
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,090
In my chest.

333
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,320
And my fists.

334
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:36,240
But I needed somewhere to go.

335
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,470
Come on.

336
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,450
Thea,you're angry.

337
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:49,640
At your mother,the D.A.,yourself,maybe.

338
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,840
But that anger is going to chew up your insides if you don't let it out.

339
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,670
I'm not going to hit you,Roy.

340
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:56,880
Try.

341
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,160
Try!

342
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,590
I said hit me,right?

343
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,800
'Cause that felt like...

344
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,880
that didn't really feel like anything.

345
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,530
Better.

346
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:11,840
But keep your wrists straight.

347
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:14,800
Don't just use your arm.Put your entire body into it.

348
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,940
Come on,again.

349
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:44,250
At least let me call Lyla.

350
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:46,240
All she could do is worry about me.

351
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,550
I found something.

352
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,060
I don't see anything.

353
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:51,520
Because you have to see what Donner does.

354
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,470
His eye caught a reflection.

355
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,010
Can you enhance?

356
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,960
It hurts me that you feel a need to ask.

357
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,180
What are those,wings?

358
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,360
It's the city seal.

359
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,090
Starling Municipal Records department.

360
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:06,530
That building's been abandoned since the city went to digital.

361
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,390
Dollars to donuts,that's where  is operating out of.

362
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,930
Not for long.

363
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,620
You shouldn't be here.

364
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,000
- My attorney needs... - Moira.

365
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:28,560
I know I could be disbarred for speaking with you,but this isn't something for lawyers.

366
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,760
This is a family matter.

367
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,410
Jean told me she's calling you to the stand tomorrow.

368
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,730
Yes.

369
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,660
You can't testify.

370
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,260
Well.

371
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:59,210
The fact that you don't want me to,Laurel,is a good indication that I should.

372
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:01,660
If you take the stand,I'll have to cross examine you,

373
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,780
and I'll have to do it to the best of my ability.

374
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,200
- Yes,I understand. - No,I don't think you do.

375
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:22,160
Forget about what this will do to Oliver and Thea.

376
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:25,090
It also could undermine your entire case.

377
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,500
So,Moira,please.

378
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,130
Please.Don't make me use this.

379
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,600
Everything is at stake for you.

380
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:39,800
And I don't want to be the one to take it all away.

381
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:45,900
Faster,please.

382
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:47,290
Faster!

383
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,360
We have a city full of customers.

384
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:51,660
And I mean this literally.

385
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:56,900
I'm afraid my production apparatus is a little over-taxed with the increased demand.

386
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,190
I can live with it,though.

387
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,230
I can't say the city can.

388
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,120
Go.

389
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,180
Be still,my heart.

390
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,700
Step away from them.

391
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:21,970
Yes,I've heard you've developed an allergy to killing.

392
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:23,160
Do it!

393
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,460
Or what?

394
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:26,090
You'll kill me?

395
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:48,200
You're really on the no killing wagon?

396
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,610
Shame.

397
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:53,020
Really letting one of life's true pleasures pass you by.

398
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:03,440
But you said you didn't want to testify.

399
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,250
But you have to.

400
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:09,240
- Because of me. - No.

401
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:10,580
You have to do damage control.

402
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,840
None of this is your fault.

403
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,710
We're here because of what I did.

404
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:18,690
Now,you both know the truth,but you don't know all of it.

405
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:21,550
Laurel does.

406
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:22,940
What does she have?

407
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,290
You shouldn't have to find this out in court.

408
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:30,690
Find out what?

409
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:38,850
Years ago... it was many yes ago...

410
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:47,380
Your father was engaging in his... his extramarital activities.

411
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:52,280
And I had a moment of weakness.

412
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,910
I cheated on him.

413
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,810
With Malcolm Merlyn.

414
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,990
No.

415
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,990
No,I...

416
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:12,470
I asked you about this.

417
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:14,630
Last year.

418
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:17,790
You said that there was nothing between you two!

419
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,950
There wasn't.

420
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,470
Sweetheart,it wasn't an affair.

421
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,850
It was very brief,and a long time ago.

422
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:25,530
And despite it,you remained friends with Mr.Merlyn.

423
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,380
In fact,he frequently attended parties at your home.

424
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,620
He was my husband's best friend until Malcolm killed him.

425
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,410
And this is why you claimed to feel as though

426
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:37,010
you were in fear for your life and the lives of your children?

427
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:39,160
Well,I think it's a fairly compelling reason.

428
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:47,790
Last year,your second husband,Walter Steel,was abducted by Mr.Merlyn,is that correct?

429
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,280
Yes.So you seen.

430
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,020
Why didn't Merlyn kill Walter,the same as your first husband?

431
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,590
I convinced Malcolm not to.

432
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,680
And Malcolm listened to you.

433
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,150
Your friend spared Walter's life,and yet,

434
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:07,670
you'd have this jury believing that you and your children were in danger?

435
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:11,200
- We were.I was afraid...  - Afraid of getting caught.

436
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:19,850
Despite whatever youthful mistakes I might have made,Malcolm Merlyn was a dangerous man.

437
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:21,360
To other people.

438
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:28,490
But the only person who truly posed a danger to Moira Queen and her family was Moira Queen.

439
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,430
Hey.

440
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,190
Ok,if you want to attack me,go right ahead.

441
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:57,310
But you should know that you're not going to say anything that I haven't already said to myself.

442
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,380
Whoa.

443
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:02,930
I know that that was difficult for you,and I just want to make sure that you're ok.

444
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:05,610
No,no.

445
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,250
I don't understand how you can forgive me after what I just did in there.

446
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,200
I don't understand how anyone could.

447
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:24,670
So,obviously you three took the Hosen out of this cave.

448
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,120
Lift him up.

449
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:31,360
Now I know he doesn't have it,which means one of you two does.

450
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,000
Give it to me,and we'll discuss an exchange.

451
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:35,950
We don't know what you're talking about.

452
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:39,190
Give us Oliver,and we'll leave you alone to look for it.

453
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,300
Anybody else want to be stupid?

454
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:48,140
Hey.Hey!Fine.Take 'em.

455
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,670
Cut him loose.

456
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,840
What are you doing?!

457
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:07,540
We have to keep moving,they're following us!

458
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:22,080
Obviously we're continuing to monitor both of these major stories

459
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:25,170
in what has become a significant news day here in Starling.

460
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:26,380
What can you tell us about...

461
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:29,060
Oliver's going to be pretty wrapped up with his mother.

462
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:32,920
You making any process on how The Count's getting Vertigo into people's systems?

463
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,330
Not much.

464
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:37,110
Each dot is the home of somebody with withdrawal symptoms.

465
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,450
That seems pretty random.

466
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,150
That's because it's very random.

467
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,430
Ok.

468
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:48,460
What if people weren't exposed at home; what if they got dosed at work?

469
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:50,710
Can you do this by their employment addresses?

470
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:54,620
I'm really starting to wonder what it would take to impress you guys.

471
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,750
It's a trail.

472
00:27:58,950 --> 00:27:59,900
A path through the city.

473
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:00,960
Any place you've been?

474
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:02,790
59th and Dell,that's where I got my flu shot.

475
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:04,600
You got your vaccination from one of those trucks,right?

476
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,040
One of those roving flu trucks?

477
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:08,710
The route.

478
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:10,870
It's a flu vaccination tour.

479
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:12,710
A truck sent out by Starling City Mobile Care.

480
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:14,410
I got addicted after one injection?

481
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:15,890
That can happen?

482
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,670
Sure.Try heroin some time.

483
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:18,970
Not try...

484
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,040
Try.

485
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:21,240
All right,where's the truck now?

486
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:22,590
Downtown.

487
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:24,150
What do you think?

488
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,140
Call Oliver?

489
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,030
No,no,he's busy with his family.I'll go.

490
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:29,300
Yeah,no.

491
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:30,680
That's not happening.

492
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:32,440
I'll go.

493
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,110
Felicity,it's too dangerous.

494
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,260
It could turn out to be nothing.

495
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,040
If it's not,I'll call.

496
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,610
...courtroom drama you've just witnessed?

497
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,560
Bethany,no one expected the turn that testimony took.

498
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:45,190
A revelation that Moira Queen once had an affair with Malcolm Merlyn

499
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,360
became the sole focus of the prosecution's cross.

500
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,710
Hello?

501
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,530
Anybody home?

502
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,640
Vertigo.Got ya.

503
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:23,910
Funny,eh?

504
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,080
You took the words right out of my mouth.

505
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,560
Thea?

506
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,300
Can we call it a night?

507
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,800
Jury just signaled that they could have a verdict.

508
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,290
Judge will not send them home.

509
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,650
He wants to get this over with.

510
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:44,420
Line forms behind me.

511
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:46,700
A verdict that quickly is bad,isn't it?

512
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,770
I think the two of you should prepare for the worst.

513
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,280
Excuse me.

514
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:00,970
Felicity...

515
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,660
Oliver.

516
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:05,550
Is it ok if I call you Oliver?

517
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:09,230
Surprised to hear from me,right?

518
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:11,780
Not as surprised as I was.

519
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:18,770
You see,I find this not unattractive blonde,getting all up in my business.

520
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:21,250
And what does she have on her?

521
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:23,680
A Queen Consolidated I.D.badge.

522
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:28,080
Now,I think to myself,why does that name ring a bell?

523
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,860
Oliver Queen.

524
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:36,480
He tried to buy off me last year,just before the hood put me in a padded cell.

525
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:40,620
Ipso facto,Arrow.

526
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:42,900
Where are you going?!

527
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:44,170
Oh...

528
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,680
Something's come up at the office.

529
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:49,800
Ollie,the jury!

530
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,600
I have to go.

531
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:23,960
Pretty swanky offices.

532
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:29,980
You can see all the destruction that your mom caused from up here.

533
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:31,640
What do you want?

534
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,150
World peace and personal satisfaction.

535
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:38,780
Though not necessarily in that order.

536
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:44,320
You poisoned me and put me in a hole.

537
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,290
You have no idea how much I hated you for that.

538
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,300
Turns out,someone else hates you,too.

539
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:54,570
- Who? - Who?Oh,you're going to be surprised when you find out.

540
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:56,880
He's a man of means.

541
00:31:57,170 --> 00:32:00,210
Set me up with my new operation so I could draw you out.

542
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:01,350
To do what?

543
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,710
This.

544
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,680
You're going to have to try harder.

545
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:10,150
Done!

546
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:20,060
Come on!

547
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,160
So now we move on to plan B.

548
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,070
Oliver,don't!Not for me!

549
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,930
Quiet,please.I'm threatening.

550
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,740
Lower your bow.

551
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,730
Your problem is with me.

552
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,470
It's not with her.

553
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,700
Well,then,consider this your penalty for making me go to plan B in the first place.

554
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:13,340
Hey.Hey.Hey,shh,shh.

555
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:16,810
It's all right.You're safe.

556
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,510
Oh,you were shot.

557
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:22,840
Hey.It's nothing.

558
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:56,800
Any news?

559
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,330
Where have you been?

560
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:01,310
Something...

561
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:02,950
happened at Queen Consolidated.

562
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:05,700
You will see it on the news later.

563
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,630
Just don't worry about it.

564
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:09,840
What would you have done if there'd been a verdict?

565
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,220
Thea...

566
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,460
I don't know.

567
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:16,290
Are you ok?

568
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:18,980
Hey.

569
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:20,380
Jury's back.

570
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:22,820
Come on.

571
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:27,200
I have received a note that the jury has arrived at a verdict.

572
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:32,760
Please publish the verdict.

573
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:40,130
In the superior court of Star county state versus Moira Queen verdict...

574
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:47,120
On one count of conspiracy in the first degree,the defendant is found not guilty.

575
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:52,780
On the 503 counts of murder in the first degree,the defendant is found...

576
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:56,680
Not guilty.

577
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,920
Mom.

578
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:21,610
I love you both so much.

579
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:36,650
A stunning result,as Moira Queen is acquitted of all charges.

580
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:40,360
In a day that's provided a week's worth of shocks and legal twists,

581
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,910
many had pronounced this case a done deal.

582
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,280
Congratulations.

583
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,030
Is that appropriate?

584
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:47,520
She should have lost.

585
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:50,170
She should have been convicted.

586
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:52,990
Did you want her to be?

587
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,470
I expected her to be.

588
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:57,660
Verdict doesn't make sense.

589
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,120
Still,your mom must be thrilled.

590
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:00,070
Beyond.

591
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,520
It's more like shock,I think.

592
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,420
They're processing her now.

593
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:06,490
I just wanted to check in on you.

594
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,300
And you.

595
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,540
I'm feeling better.

596
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,160
And,with the Vertigo tainted vaccine,

597
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:17,280
Queen Consolidated's Applied Sciences Division was able to formulate a non-addictive treatment.

598
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:21,390
Good.

599
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,490
I need to meet my family at home.

600
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:28,720
So you guys go home,get rest.

601
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:36,010
- Good night. - Good night.

602
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:40,490
Oliver.I,uh...

603
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:44,200
- I just wanted to say thank you. - Yeah.

604
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:45,880
And I'm sorry.

605
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:48,430
For what?

606
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:52,400
I got myself into trouble again,and you...

607
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,000
killed him.

608
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:59,820
You killed again,and I am sorry that I was the one to put you in a position where you had to make that kind of choice.

609
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,320
Felicity...

610
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:05,860
He had you,and he was going to hurt you.

611
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,250
There was no choice to make.

612
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:20,900
Why did you do that?!

613
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:23,000
Because you stopped the captain from killing me.

614
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,050
Thank you for coming.

615
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:27,350
Shado,he doesn't look too good.

616
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,010
He's not.

617
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:30,240
Who's this?

618
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:31,430
It's complicated.

619
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,260
That Hosen thing they're looking for is back on the plane.

620
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:37,400
No,I've got it.

621
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,220
It has a Buddhist inscription on one side.

622
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,730
It reminded me of my father.

623
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:44,670
I'm pretty sure they aren't interested in Buddhism.

624
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:46,180
What's on the other side?

625
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:52,440
Ok,numbers,what...

626
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,180
Coordinates.

627
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:56,850
To what?

628
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:01,450
A Kairyu-class Japanese submarine which ran aground here during World War II.

629
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:04,320
What do these guys want with a 70 year old sub?

630
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:07,090
The sub isn't important,but what's on it...

631
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:10,250
It'll save the human race.

632
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:14,210
Will it save him?

633
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:26,260
Well,you survived your own stupidity,congratulations.

634
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,870
You know...

635
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,580
I needed you to deal with any resistance that I encountered on the island.

636
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,680
I got to say,you've done a fairly lousy job of that.

637
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,090
Congratulations.

638
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:43,880
You're the new captain.

639
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:55,990
I arranged for  to take out the Arrow,and all I accomplish is reigniting the vigilante's killing spree.

640
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:58,220
Sir,there's been a development.

641
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:23,210
Brother Cyrus...

642
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,640
How do you feel?

643
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:31,270
Stronger.

644
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,940
Good.

645
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:35,770
Then you're ready.

646
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:42,270
Mrs.Queen,how does it feel to get away with murder?

647
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:45,490
Once you go out back,there's a car waiting for you.

648
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,030
Did you kill your first husband?

649
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:48,390
Just keep going.

650
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:53,670
Obviously Mrs.Queen is overjoyed that the jury has ruled that she was acting under terrible duress.

651
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:55,500
Can you give us anything else?

652
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,690
This way,Mrs.Queen.

653
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,590
The freeway will be quicker.

654
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,940
I'm sorry,Mrs.Queen.

655
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:23,970
I was instructed not to take you home.

656
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,620
Not yet.

657
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:38,420
Where are we?

658
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,240
I-I don't know this place.

00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:42,550
I've got her,sir.

660
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:50,270
Hello,Moira.

661
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,630
They said you were dead!

662
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:56,850
There are parts of the world where death is an illusion.

663
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:58,260
I've been to one.

664
00:40:58,430 --> 00:40:59,940
I learned to be very convincing.

665
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:04,420
But I returned because you needed my help.

666
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:08,550
Help?

667
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:10,220
With your trial.

668
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:14,310
You didn't think that jury acquitted you without a little persuasion?

669
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,240
Dear God.

670
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,710
What do you want,Malcolm?

671
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:25,020
I still have resources in Starling.

672
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,100
Associates.

673
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:31,460
Including one in the D.A.'s office.

674
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:35,260
I followed Mr.Donner's investigation of you with interest.

675
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:40,160
The ease with which you lied about us for years,it made me wonder whether you lied to me .

676
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,430
No.No.

677
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:48,260
It was a matter of a simple surreptitious genetics test to confirm my suspicion.

678
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:49,750
Don't.

679
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:55,290
Imagine my joy at learning that Thea is my daughter.
