我毁掉了你的文件
I destroyed your file. 

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,400
但不确定那是唯一的一份
I can't be certain that's the only one they have.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,000
如果他们发现你有前科 肯定会撤销你的签证
If they find out you've got a history, they will revoke your visa

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,800
然后遣送你回国
and they will send you home,

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,360
有前科的人是不允许获得学习签证的
because people with histories don't get study visas.

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,240
这是一个女人昨晚放在我们门口的
A woman left this at our door last night.

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,047
在你被杀的那晚它就不见了 
Disappeared on the night you were murdered. 

8
00:00:18,048 --> 00:00:19,880
没想到现在又出现了
Now it's returned to me.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,400
这女孩很漂亮呢
Pretty girl.

10
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,000
你想让我找到她的档案
You wanted me to find her file.

11
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,920
别着急 我们这里还有很多有趣的照片
Don't worry. We have many interesting photographs.

12
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,840
怎么了?
What's wrong?

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,520
弗兰克 我喜欢上别人了 我要搬出去了
Frank, I've met someone. I'm moving out.

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,994
康 你居然出卖我! 
You set me up, Kang!  

15
00:00:34,995 --> 00:00:36,440
不然他们会吊死我的!
They were gonna hang me!

16
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,560
- 我们完了 - 我们早完了 山姆!
- We're done. - We've been done for a while, Sam!

17
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,240
我想找山姆 但他还没有回来
I was supposed to meet Sam. He hasn't come back yet.

18
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,240
你确定想看他这个样子?
You're sure you want to see this?

19
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,800
他还好吗?
Is he alright?

20
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,600
至少好几个小时他哪儿都去不了
He won't be going anywhere for a few hours.

21
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,360
最好让他在这里睡一觉
Better to just let him sleep it off here.

22
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:27,060
石龙岗之路 第一季第08集


23
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,440
你想谈谈这事吗?
Do you want to talk about it?

24
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,720
山姆?
Sam?

25
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,720
你看 我已经道过歉了 但你要明白...
Look, I said I'm sorry, but, you know...

26
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,920
- 嘿 你当时完全失去意识了
- Hey.You were completely unconscious.

27
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,700
又不是每天都会这样
It's not like it happens every day.

28
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,420
你也知道 我遇到你之后就再没碰过了
You know, I haven't touched it since we met.

29
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,100
但你昨晚又开始了
But you chose last night to start again.

30
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,580
我们说好了
We had an arrangement.

31
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,820
- 我们约好见面的 - 没错
- We were meant to meet. - Yeah.

32
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,380
你要说的就这些?
That's all you're going to say about it?

33
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,660
康走私炸药被抓了
Kang was caught smuggling explosives.

34
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,420
我意思是... 他说他是被陷害的
I mean... he said he was set up.

35
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,660
我信了他 结果一个无辜的人被杀害了
And because I believed him, an innocent man was shot.

36
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:30,100
为什么你不等等 和我商量一下呢?
Why didn't you wait, talk to me about it?

37
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,860
我们不是要一起吗?
We're together, aren't we?

38
00:03:38,861 --> 00:03:39,820
当然了
Of course we are.

39
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,160
听着 你还打算告诉弗兰克吗?
Listen, you still plan on telling Frank?

40
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,880
山姆! 辛普森夫人
Sam! Mrs Simpson.

41
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,920
打扰了 有一个澳大利亚外交官在侦探所等你
Sorry, there's an Australian diplomat at the agency.

42
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,160
- 能等会吗? - 恐怕不行
- Can it wait? - Not really.

43
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,440
去吧 去吧 稍后我再来找你
Go, go. Um... I'll come back later.

44
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,638
郑夫人 希望你能理解 
As you can understand, 

45
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,600
这件事您必须优先处理
this has to take complete priority, Mrs Cheng.

46
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,600
山姆 这是澳大利亚大使馆的安德森先生
Sam. You know Mr Anderson from Australian Embassy.

47
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,760
- 斯图尔特 - 天哪 山姆你看起来真糟
- Stuart. - God, Sam, you look like hell.

48
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,600
如果我知道你来 就会花时间打理一下了
If I'd known you were gonna be here, I would've made the effort.

49
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,640
听说你弄丢了几个澳大利亚女孩
Heard you lost a couple of Australian girls.

50
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,120
什么? 不 我没有...
What? No, I didn't...

51
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,880
她们在一艘开往伦敦的货船上
They were on a freighter, bound for London.

52
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,425
安德森先生本打算去接应 
Mr Anderson was to meet them 

53
00:04:37,426 --> 00:04:38,580
然后让她们乘飞机回国
and send them on a plane home,

54
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,360
但是他到了之后她们都不见了
but they were gone when he arrived.

55
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,560
什么时候外交官们开始关注起观光客了?
Since when do diplomats babysit tourists?

56
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,000
因为其中一个女孩是加里・艾奎斯特的女儿
Since one of the girls was Gary Edquist's daughter.

57
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,320
艾奎斯特?
Edquist?

58
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,360
我想他拥有你们北部国土的一半面积
I believe he owns half of your Northern Territory,

59
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,040
可对土地任意取舍
give or take an acre.

60
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,120
她当时是在货船上旅行吗?
What was she doing travelling on a freighter?

61
00:04:52,121 --> 00:04:53,926
她老爸都可以买只班轮了  
Dad could have bought a liner.  

62
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,700
显然 她老爸并不知情
Apparently, Daddy did not know.

63
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,400
干得不错呢
Well, good for her.

64
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,720
我们还是告诉她老爸只在乎他的生意算了!
I mean, come on, tell her old man to mind his own business!

65
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,200
这样问题就解决了 哈?
Problem solved, huh?

66
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,320
轮船靠岸时这些女孩并不在船上
The girls weren't on the ship when it docked.

67
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,640
海关也没有她们在新加坡上岸的记录
And Customs has no record of disembarkation in Singapore.

68
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,280
还有她老爸是首相的密友
And her father is a close friend of the Prime Minister.

69
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,040
不是吧
Oh, for fuck's sake.

70
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,720
我们必须找到这些女孩
We have to find the girls.

71
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,120
卡米拉・艾奎斯特 19岁
Camilla Edquist. 19.

72
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,680
已被悉尼大学法律系录取
She's been accepted into law at Sydney Uni.

73
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,160
她朋友呢?
Who's her friend?

74
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,920
吉娜・克肖
Gina Kershaw.

75
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,120
消防局炊事员的女儿
She's the daughter of the station cook.

76
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,800
她们一块长大
The girls grew up together.

77
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,320
好吧 我们去找这个船长谈谈
Right, let's talk to this captain.

78
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,640
你最后一次见到她们是什么时候?
When was the last time you saw them?

79
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,640
晚饭时间
Dinner time.

80
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,034
她们像往常一样 
They grabbed their food 

81
00:05:59,035 --> 00:06:01,040
拿了吃的到她们的船舱里去吃
and took off to their cabin, just like always.

82
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,120
你和她们聊得来吗? 喜欢她们吗?
Did you get on with them? Did you like 'em?

83
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,280
我不必和她们套近乎 她们只是付费的乘客
I don't have to get on with them. They were paying passengers.

84
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,760
我喜欢的是她们的钱
I like their money.

85
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,000
所以你也想不出她们的去向?
And you've got no idea where they could be?

86
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,360
不知道 问完了吗?
No. We done?

87
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,840
完了
Yeah.

88
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,200
我半小时后加燃油
I'm bunkering fuel in half an hour.

89
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,120
在太阳落山前开船
We cast off by sunset.

90
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,560
看 她们不在这儿 你满意了吧?
Oh, look, they're not here. You happy?

91
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,760
我们不应该去唐人街找她们吗?
Look, shouldn't we be in Chinatown trying to find them?

92
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,760
有人去那看过了
Someone's had a go at that.

93
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,320
这是什么?
What?

94
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,800
看来有人曾尝试把这门踢开
Looks like someone's tried to kick the door in.

95
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,360
你想说什么?
What are you saying?

96
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,920
或许什么都不是 是这船太旧了
It may be nothing. It's an old boat.

97
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,080
听着 大使答应了艾奎斯特先生
Look, the ambassador promised Mr Edquist

98
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,640
而我答应了大使
and I promised the ambassador.

99
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,400
- 你报警了吗? - 什么? 没有
- Did you alert the Singapore police? - What? No.

100
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,880
我不认为...
Look, I didn't think...

101
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,400
这些女孩可能只是想去城里 去观光旅游
The girls have probably just gone into town. They've gone sightseeing.

102
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,280
那她们为什么要带行李?
So why did they take their luggage?

103
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,920
大概是要待在新加坡又不想告诉其他人
Maybe they decided to stay in Singapore and not tell anyone.

104
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,800
所以偷偷地过了海关
Snuck past Customs.

105
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,280
或许吧
Maybe.

106
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,840
她们知道你是来带她们回国的吗?
Did they know that you were coming to send 'em home?

107
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,320
不知道
No.

108
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,460
那么 为什么她们要溜走? 
Well, why did they sneak off, then? 

109
00:07:12,461 --> 00:07:13,680
为什么不过海关?
Why not go through Customs?

110
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,120
给我一小时时间 如果我还找不到她们...
Give me an hour. If I can't find them...

111
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,880
我马上报警
I'll call the police.

112
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,440
你是谁? 你想干什么?
Who are you? What do you want?

113
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,920
- 你是帕特丽夏・郑? - 你是谁?
- You're Patricia Cheng? - Who are you?

114
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,840
我是美玲 我...
I'm Mei Ling. I...

115
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,200
- 我们能去别处谈谈吗? - 谈什么?
- Can we go somewhere to talk? - About what?

116
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,120
这附近有个茶社
There's a tea house around here.

117
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,120
- 我有话要说... - 就在这儿说吧
- What I have to say... - You can say it right here.

118
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:41,360
我见过你丈夫... 就在他出事的那晚
I saw your husband... on the night he died.

119
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,720
你看到了?
Did you see it?

120
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,720
- 你知道发生什么事了吗? - 不知道
- Do you know what happened? - No.

121
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,280
然后呢?
Then what?

122
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,200
那晚早些时候 我们在一起
We were together, earlier in the night.

123
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,680
在一起?
Together?

124
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,320
你是他的客户... 还是朋友?
You were a client... or friend?

125
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,240
比朋友更近一些
More than friends.

126
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,920
我是在周怡家工作的时候认识他的
We met each other when I worked at Joo Ee's.

127
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,040
我生了他的孩子
I had his baby.

128
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,520
一个男孩
A boy.

129
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,240
已经四岁了
He's four now.

130
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,600
以前温斯顿抚养他
Winston used to provide for him.

131
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,198
可自从他死了... 
But since his death... 

132
00:09:21,199 --> 00:09:23,880
我已经花光了所有的积蓄
I've run out of all my savings.

133
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
我没有其他人可以依靠了
I've no-one else to turn to.

134
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,640
你真无耻 你个下流的骗子
You have no sense of shame.You dirty liar.

135
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,240
那块手表
The watch.

136
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,760
七月份我放在你家门阶上了
I left it on your doorstep during Seventh Month.

137
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,400
如果你再跟着我 我就报警了

138
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,400
大娘

139
00:09:59,501 --> 00:10:01,400

00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:02,401
给我你的手


141
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,420
今天你想要什么消息?
What you want today?

142

离开这里!
Get out of here!

156
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,380
他们是猎户星船的人吗?
These guys off the Orion Star?

157
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,380
只有那个人是
Just that guy.

158
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,856
先生? 在你杀了这小子之前 
Gentlemen? Mind if I have a word with this bloke 

159
00:11:12,857 --> 00:11:13,540
介意我和他说两句吗?

160
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,220
滚远点儿
Stay out of it.

161
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,700

00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:34,260
- 你就是杰克? - 是啊

163
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:47,660
你出现的时候 我正好恢复元气了

165
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,260
没什么的 那 说说这些女孩子吧
Oh, don't mention it.So, these girls, you were saying?

166
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,780
好 大部分时间
Yeah. Oh, kept to themselves.

167
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,940
她们都自己呆着 
You know, most of the time.

168
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,780
那剩下的时间呢?
How about the rest of the time?

169
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:03,180
你应该和霍克谈谈
You ought to talk to Hawk about that.

170
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,060
霍克是谁?
Who's Hawk?

171
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:07,900
就是那个手臂上有个老鹰纹身的中国小混混
Oh, mad Chinese bastard with a hawk tattoo on his arm.

172
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,380
亚麻色头发的那个
The blonde-haired one was all over him.

173
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,660
那个黑妞呢? 她有没有和谁在一起?
What about the brunette? Was she with anyone?

174
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,180
没有吧 至少我不知道
Nah, not that I saw.

175
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:17,220
一开始几天她们真的很友好
Oh, they were friendly enough in the first few days,

176
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,100
但是她们根本不知道她们来是要干什么
but they had no idea what they were in for.

177
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,500
你什么意思?
What you mean?

178
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:32,020
听着 你得知道... 只有他喝醉的时候
Look, you gotta understand...it's only when he drinks.

179
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:38,660
我们有证人看见你袭击了那些女孩
We have a witness who says he saw you attack those girls.

180
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,140
胡说
That's bullshit.

181
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,260
- 你有没有强暴他们? - 没有
- Did you rape them? - No.

182
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:45,060
但是你跟踪她们到了船舱里 踢门而入
But you followed them back to their cabin, kicked the door in.

183
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,020
没有 我不会回答你们任何问题
No. I'm not saying anything.

184
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,780
- 我要找律师 - 去你的律师!
- I want a lawyer. - Screw the lawyer!

185
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,980
- 她们到底在哪儿? - 我不知道
- Where the bloody hell are they? - I don't know.

186
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:55,060
也许她们威胁说要报警 你就让她们闭嘴了
Maybe they threatened to go to the police so you shut 'em up.

187
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,860
在中国南海没有人会找到她们的尸体的
No one's going to find their bodies in the South China Seas.

188
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,380
- 什么? - 天呐
- What? - Oh, Lord.

189
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,620
这太疯狂了 你一定要相信我
That's crazy.You have to believe me.

190
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,168
我碰都没碰她们一下 
I didn't touch 'em.

191
00:13:04,169 --> 00:13:05,140
那你做了什么?
Well, what did you do?

192
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,660
我当时喝醉了 好吗?
I was pissed. Alright?

193
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,620
我想进她们的船舱
I tried to get into their cabin,

194
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:17,300
但是霍克还有其他人 他们不让我进去
but Hawk and the others,they stopped me.

195
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,380
要是你不相信我 去问他们啊
If you don't believe me, ask them.

196
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,500
关于霍克你知道多少?
What do you know about this Hawk guy?

197
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,260
他真名叫杜坦
Real name, Do Tan.

198
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,180
几年前保释后消失了
Jumped bail and disappeared a couple of years ago.

199
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:29,100
街上三流小混混 与红龙帮有染
Small-time street thug.Known associate of the Red Dragons.

200
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:35,100
我负责集合船员 找到霍克 再看看他怎么说
I'll round up the crew, find Hawk,and let's see what he has to say.

201
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,900
汤米
Tommy.

202
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,500
见过这些女孩吗?


203
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,900
确定吗?


204
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,580
- 五百 数数吧 - 这是什么?
- 500. Count it.- What's this?

205
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:05,780
是你那一半股份 我买下了
It's your half of the business.I'm buying you out.

206
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:12,060
你知道吗... 有些人可以是好朋友
You know... how some people make great friends

207
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:15,220
可作为商业伙伴却很差劲?
but they're just lousy business partners?

208
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:18,140
你不应该带她去那里
You shouldn't have brought her there.

209
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,740
你根本不应该出现在那里
You shouldn't have been there, man.

210
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,300
真高兴你推荐了这个地方
You know,I'm so glad you suggested this.

211
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,100
我好出来跟女孩们吃吃午饭
It got me out of lunch with the girls.

212
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,100
哪里?
Where?

213
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:41,780
那个可怕的螃蟹餐厅 利奈特爱死了
Oh, that awful crab restaurant Lynette loves so much.

214
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,660
就在河那边 她说她想叫你来着
It's down on the river.She said she tried to call you.

215
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,380
我很久没回家了
I haven't been home much.

216
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,980
我离开了弗兰克
I've left Frank.

217
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,060
明白了
Mmm... I see.

218
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,060
不好意思
Excuse me.

219
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,833
麻烦给我两杯琴酒补剂好吗? 
Can I get two gins and tonic? 

220
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:02,140
特浓的 加酸橙
Doubles. With lime.

221
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,140
我能问问你是为了谁才离开他的吗?
May I ask for who?

222
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,285
一定要因为别人吗?  
Does there have to be a who?  

223
00:15:09,286 --> 00:15:10,940
从我的经验来看 是的
Well, in my experience, yes.

224
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,340
山姆・卡拉汉
Sam Callaghan.

225
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,740
这就对了
Right.

226
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:19,660
好吧 可以理解
Well... one had speculated.

227
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,500
我是说 山姆 一表人才
I mean, Sam, you know, he's awfully good-looking,

228
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,460
充满激情 勇于冒险
he's dangerous, he's exciting.

229
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,700
不过从长远看 还是应该考虑弗兰克
But for the long haul,one would have thought Frank.

230
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,380
但是 山姆 我从来...
But, Sam, I've...

231
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,587
...从来没有过那样的感受... 
...I've never felt anything like that... 

232
00:15:36,588 --> 00:15:38,380
跟任何人在一起都没有
with anyone.

233
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,620
克莱尔 我得承认
You've got guts, Claire.

234
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,260
你真有胆量
I'll give you that.

235
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,500
一小时之前有人把这个放在了领事馆
Someone dropped it at the consulate about an hour ago.

236
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,500
一万英镑 否则撕票
'￡10,000 or we kill 'em.'

237
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,100
直奔主题啊 是吧?
Straight to the point, isn't it?

238
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,159
你觉得她们现在在谁手上?  
Who do you think's got 'em?  

239
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,380
很明显啊 不是吗?
Well, it's obvious, isn't it?

240
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:06,340
海滨那片儿是谁控制的? 凯・索和他的手下
Who controls the waterfront? Kay Song and his thugs.

241
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,144
否则他们怎么下船?  
How else did they get off the boat?  

242
00:16:07,145 --> 00:16:08,340
他们不会这样做的
They don't operate like that.

243
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,380
- 你在说什么啊? - 虎威将军控制红龙
- What are you talking about? - Tiger General runs the Red Dragons.

244
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:14,900
他们很守旧 赌钱 嫖娼
He's strictly old-school, gambling, prostitution.

245
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,020
他们不会绑架游客 
They don't kidnap tourists.  

246
00:16:16,021 --> 00:16:16,980
他们现在这么做了!
They have now!

247
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,700
- 我们没有证据 - 这就是我需要的证据
- We have no proof.- This is all the proof I need.

248
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,940
我要他们搞突然袭击 找到那些女孩
I want their premises raided and the girls found.

249
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,500
你没这个权利
You have no authority.

250
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,740
很快就有了 我要正式成为你上司了
I will soon enough.I'm officially going over your head.

251
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,660
为什么你们这些人总以为自己知道很多?
Why do you colonials always think you know best?

252
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,980
- 嘿 - 好了
- Hey.- Alright.

253
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,900
好好
It's alright.

254
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:10,020
我爷爷很不爽
My grandfather is very unhappy.

255
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,900
是吗? 不爽的不只他一个
Yeah? Well, he's not the only one.

256
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,820
说说袭击的事吧
Tell me about the raids.

257
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,140
很明显 你绑架了两个澳大利亚女孩
Apparently,you kidnapped two Australian girls.

258
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,660
那警察为什么不这样觉得呢?
And why would the police think that?

259
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,660
他们被混淆了
Well, let's just say they were persuaded to the view.

260
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:33,420
有人找刺激拿枪指着他们的脑袋吗?
So someone put a gun to their head to make my life more exciting?

261
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,980
我想他们别无选择
I don't think they had much choice.

262
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,700
不要为懦弱找借口
Weakness is no excuse.

263
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,860
我知道是你的人绑架了她们
We know one of your men's got them.

264
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,340
你知道?
Do you?

265
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,620
叫霍克的那个混蛋
Bloke by the name of Hawk.

266
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,660
霍克与十三红龙无关
Hawk is no friend of the 13 Red Dragons.

267
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,020
实际上 他最后一次被看见是在香港
In fact, he was last spotted in Hong Kong,

268
00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:00,620
可能是在跟什么老妓女翻云覆雨呢
probably catching the clap from some old prostitute.

269
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,100
他回到新加坡了
He's back in Singapore.

270
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,460
你可以帮我找到他
You could help me find him.

271
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,860
爷爷 我们不能袖手旁观


272
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,860
让这些畜生无法无天


273
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,860
我的父亲不会这么做


274
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,860
让我处理吧


275
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:44,500
这些澳大利亚人真是杞人忧天啊
Those Australians really have got their knickers in a knot.

276
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:48,060
看来他们给两个栽培者带错了路
Seems they've misplaced two of their breeders.

277
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:52,980
目前为止 新加坡在这案子里占优势
Still, with Singapore's finest now on the case,

278
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,300
我保证他们迟早会现身
I'm sure they'll turn up sooner or later.

279
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,980
要么死了 要么活着
Dead or alive.

280
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,020
你想见我
You wanted to see me.

281
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,180
坐下吧
Well, sit down.

282
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,500
你喝什么茶?
How do you have your tea?

283
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,620
我需要知道
I'll need to know.

284
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:20,340
我们还有长久的良好合作前景呢
We have many years happy collaboration ahead of us.

285
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,060
你说什么?
Excuse me?

286
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:25,660
你是我进入兰利的新渠道
You're my new conduit into Langley.

287
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:29,100
我估计你喜欢先加牛奶吧 是吧?
I expect you take milk in first,hmm?

288
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:34,380
你要我帮你监视中情局?
You want me to spy on the CIA for you?

289
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,740
我们不应该是同一个团队吗?
Aren't we supposed to be on the same team?

290
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,540
你到底什么想法?
What on earth made you think that?

291
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:44,340
这是莫大的荣幸啊 米勒先生
It's always a pleasure, Mr Miller.

292
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,620
要是传出去 你毁了一份
If it gets out that you destroyed a file

293
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:50,940
有关一个共产主义潜伏特工的文件
relating to a potential Communist sleeper agent,

294
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:54,912
而且你所作所为还是出于个人原因 
and you did so for personal reasons,

295
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:56,580
受你老二的唆使
dictated by your penis,

296
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,020
你的前途就毁了
your career will be over.

297
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:02,660
你本国的人民很可能会吊死你
Your own people might even hang you.

298
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:07,340
当然 还有苏玲
And then... of course, there's Su Ling.

299
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,860
不会有美国人支持她
No America for her.

300
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:15,940
事实上 马来西亚特别支队
In fact, the Malaysian Special Branch

301
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,740
明天就有可能逮捕她
might even arrest her tomorrow.

302
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,061
你有一晚上的时间考虑 
You have till tonight. 

303
00:22:23,062 --> 00:22:25,060
希望你能做出明智的选择
Make the sensible choice.

304
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:41,100
假如我不是中情局的一员
Imagine if I wasn't in the CIA.

305
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,340
那就太好了
That would be great.

306
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,620
假如你也不想去美国上大学
And if you didn't want to go to college in the States.

307
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,740
我们就可以一起逃跑了
We could just run away together.

308
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,220
跑去哪儿?
To where?

309
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,900
澳大利亚
Australia.

310
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,420
- 澳大利亚? - 嗯
- Australia? - Mmm.

311
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,780
康拉德  这样如何?
Conrad, how about this?

312
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:03,620
我们一起去美国 我上完大学取得学位
Let's go to America, let me get my degree

313
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:07,340
然后或许 我说或许 我们就结婚吧
and then maybe, just maybe, I'll let you marry me.

314
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,100
不行吗?
No?

315
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,900
这太疯狂了
Sounds crazy.

316
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,980
好吧 那我们就一起去看袋鼠吧
Alright, then let's go see the kangaroos.

317
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:18,100
不不不 我只是想...
No, no, no, I just thought...

318
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,180
想什么?
Thought what?

319
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,780
没什么
Nothing.

320
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,860
没什么 一起都会好起来的
Nothing. It's all gonna be fine.

321
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,420
肯定会的
Of course it will.

322
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,800
郑太太
Mrs Cheng.

323
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,280
你认识我丈夫
You knew my husband.

324
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:25,400
- 是啊 大家都爱他 - 他经常来这里
- Oh, yes. Everyone loved him. - He was here a lot.

325
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,000
有时他会来跟乐队一起玩
Sometimes he get up and play with the band.

326
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,880
我们都很想念他
We all miss him.

327
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,640
他认识那个这里工作过的女孩
He knew a girl who sometimes worked here?

328
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,680
- 美玲吗? - 是的
- Mei Ling? - Yes.

329
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,040
他跟她有多熟?
How well did he know her?

330
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,520
- 我不太清楚... - 他有没有...
- I really don't know what the... - Did he...

331
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,800
他有没有跟她交往?
Did he have an affair with her?

332
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,520
我不知道 不清楚
I don't know. Not for sure.

333
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,800
她说她怀了他的孩子
She says there is a child.

334
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,640
我要知道真相
I need to know the truth.

335
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,920
我不确定那是不是他的小孩
I'm not sure it was his.

336
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,640
但我从没见过她和别的男人在一起
I never saw her with another man.

337
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,080
郑太太 你还好吧?
Mrs Cheng, are you alright?

338
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,280
我能为你做些什么吗?
Is there something I can do?

339
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,520
能 离山姆远点
Yes. Leave Sam alone.

340
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,680
抱歉 你说什么?
Excuse me?

341
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,440
就算帮我个忙 回你自己丈夫身边吧
Do him a favour.  Go back to your husband.

342
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,768
我不能 再也不会了  
I can't. Not anymore. 

343
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:05,360
那就别毁了他的生活
Then don't ruin his life too.

344
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,600
我的价格很合理 好吗?
I think I paid a fair price, OK?

345
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,200
如果你还想为了几美元跟我讨价还价...
If you wanna haggle over a few dollars...

346
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,560
我需要你的帮助
I need your help.

347
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,960
不是让你白帮我 我会付钱
It's not a favour. I can pay.

348
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,380
如果我想让两个女孩悄悄离开一艘货船
If I wanted to get two girls off a freighter unnoticed,

349
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,020
我要怎么做?
how would I do it?

350
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,380
- 多少钱? - 什么多少钱? 
- How much? - How much what?

351
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:35,320
你说你会付钱 多少钱?  
You said you'd pay. How much?

352
00:26:35,321 --> 00:26:37,460
十块钱 这价格很合理
Ten. It's a fair price.

353
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,900
这叫做循环取货
It's called a milk run.

354
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,380
皮条客们会把妓女们带到货船上
Pimps will take the working girls out to the freighter

355
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,340
给那些不能上岸的船员们
for crew who can't make it ashore.

356
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:49,020
然后他们会把她们带回来的 是吗?
Then they bring them back, yeah?

357
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:51,556
好吧 - 就这样? 
OK.  - That's it? 

358
00:26:51,557 --> 00:26:53,140
这钱赚得真容易啊
Oh, that's easy money.

359
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,418
我要你查出昨晚在猎户星号货船上
I need you to find out 

360
00:26:55,419 --> 00:26:56,540
有没有循环取货
if there was a milk run to Orion Star last night.

361
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,940
我还有生意要做
I got a business to run.

362
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,100
我觉得两个女孩子在船上被绑架了
I think two girls were kidnapped off the ship.

363
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,620
绑架的人是为了勒索赎金
They're being held for ransom.

364
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,020
你先帮我搬这些货
Help me with this first.

365
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,660
是谁指使你的?
Who are you working for?

366
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,500
什么?
What?

367
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:26,180
我丈夫被人谋杀了
Someone murdered my husband,

368
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:31,220
而你告诉我这个故事 这个捏造的故事
and now you arrive with this story, this fabrication.

369
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,362
是为了玷污他的名声 
Is this to muddy his reputation, 

370
00:28:33,363 --> 00:28:35,940
好让我不去追究凶手是谁吗?
so I don't go look for his killer?

371
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:40,580
- 不是 - 你怎么拿到他的表的?
- No. - How did you get his watch?

372
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,140
你到底有什么目的?
What do you really want?

373
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:48,140
他根本没有情妇 是吗?
There was no affair, was there?

374
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:51,540
也没人怀孕 没有小孩 对不对?
No pregnancy? No child?

375
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,620
妈咪?
Mummy?

376
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,420
你先回去睡觉吧


377
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,920
妈妈等下讲故事给你听


378
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:23,900
他死的那晚 来过这里
On the night he died, he was here.

379
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,980
他通常在周三过来
He usually came on Wednesdays.

380
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:33,540
每周三 他都说去打麻将
Wednesdays, he played mahjong.

381
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:38,700
但是那晚我没想到他会来
But I wasn't expecting him that night.

382
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:43,140
他看上去很忧虑 甚至有点恐惧
He seemed worried, even scared.

383
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:46,660
他确信有人在跟踪他
He believed that someone was following him,

384
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:49,860
想要伤害他
that they meant to do him harm.

385
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:54,100
他走之前 给了我这块表
Before he left, he gave me the watch.

386
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:02,280
他说如果出了什么事 就把表给你
He said to give it to you, should anything happen.

387
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:08,240
我本想留着那块表 为了我们的儿子
I wanted to keep it, for our boy.

388
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,180
但我做不到
But I couldn't.

389
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,820
我没钱了
I've run out of money.

390
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,060
我无路可走
I've nowhere else to turn.

391
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,700
请你等等
Please.

392
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,665
他爱你吗?
Did he love you? 

393
00:30:29,066 --> 00:30:31,220
他爱我们的儿子
He loved our boy.

394
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,340
他爱你吗?
Did he love you?

395
00:30:34,341 --> 00:30:38,380
他不爱我 但他爱我们的儿子
No, he didn't. But he loved our son.

396
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:42,060
他说孩子是你一直渴望得到的
He said it was the one thing that you've always wished for.

397
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,361
你们在一起多久? 
How long?

398
00:30:50,132 --> 00:30:53,400
不久 就几个晚上 仅此而已
Not long. A few nights, no more.

399
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,576
求你了  
Please. 

400
00:30:57,277 --> 00:31:02,020
你尽管恨我吧 但别恨孩子
Hate me all you want, but not the boy.

401
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:05,180
那温斯顿呢?
What about Winston?

402
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:11,100
我要怎样体谅我的丈夫呢?
What do I feel for my husband?

403
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,740
艾奎斯特正在替我凑赎金
Edquist is wiring the ransom money to me now.

404
00:31:29,741 --> 00:31:30,700
我一小时内就能拿到钱了
I'll have it in an hour.

405
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,780
你本可以不用惹这些麻烦的
You could have saved yourself some trouble.

406
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:36,220
我差点没渴死
Oh! A man could die of thirst around here.

407
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,060
多谢 安格
Thanks, Ange.

408
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:41,740
那个叫艾奎斯特的女孩怎么样了?
So, what's the latest on the Edquist girl?

409
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,900
- 官方消息 无可奉告 - 非官方的呢?
- Officially, no comment. - Unofficially?

410
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,820
去你的
Bugger off.

411
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,587
所以你有什么消息给我 
So you got something for me, 

412
00:31:49,588 --> 00:31:51,080
还是我用我现有的?
or do I run with what I got?

413
00:31:51,085 --> 00:31:52,963
"牧场主女儿的黑社会恐怖故事" 
'Grazier's Daughter Triad Horror'. 

414
00:31:52,964 --> 00:31:54,020
这名字就说明了一切
This story writes itself.

415
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,780
我很快就回来
Back in a sec.

416
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,260
- 打听到什么了吗? - 一个人名
- What have you got? - A name.

417
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,260
他带了两个女孩出去 却带着四个女孩回来
He went out with two girls, came back with four,

418
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,740
还有几个船员
along with a few crew.

419
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,140
- 这是他带她们去的地方 - 谢谢
- This is where he dropped them. - Thanks.

420
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:10,900
嘿 要把她们带回来哦
Hey, bring them back, yeah?

421
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,200
你好吗?


422
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,200
你有见过这些女孩吗?


423
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,660
霍克!
Hawk!

424
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,880
有人吗?
Hello?

425
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,280
好了好了 没事了 我不会伤害你的
It's OK, it's OK, it's alright. I'm not gonna hurt you.

426
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,520
放轻松 冷静
Just relax, relax.

427
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,899
卡米拉? 我叫山姆 
Camilla? I'm Sam. 

428
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,560
我是来救你们离开这儿的
I'm going to get you out of here.

429
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,840
找到吉娜了吗? 她还好吗?
Have you found Gina? Is she alright?

430
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:10,280
我上上下下找遍了那里 就是不见吉娜的踪迹
I searched the place top to bottom. There was no sign of Gina.

431
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:14,696
那么卡米拉最后一次见她是什么时候?  
So when did Camilla see her last?  

432
00:35:14,697 --> 00:35:16,040
大概两小时前
About two hours ago.

433
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,760
她说她们被分开关押
She said they were kept separate

434
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,080
这样就不能一起逃跑了
so they wouldn't escape without each other.

435
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,960
她在这儿吗?   
Is she here?  

436
00:35:24,961 --> 00:35:26,080
她在跟她父亲通电话
She's on the phone with her father.

437
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,680
我是澳大利亚领事馆的斯图尔特・安德森
Stuart Anderson from the Australian Consulate.

438
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,160
很高兴看到你安全归来
We're so glad that you're safe.

439
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,320
爸爸 有个政府部门的人来了
Daddy, there's a man from the government here.

440
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,600
他想跟你通话
He wants to talk to you.

441
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,720
你还好吗? 你父亲呢?
You alright? How's your father?

442
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,280
他很生气
Angry.

443
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,480
不过很欣慰我没事
Glad that I'm OK.

444
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,160
你说船长跟这件事无关?
So you were saying the Captain wasn't involved?

445
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,960
不 呃...
No, um...

446
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,680
他曾试图...
After he tried...

447
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,240
我只是再也不能呆在那艘船上了
Just couldn't be on that ship anymore.

448
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,040
没事 我们理解
It's OK. We understand.

449
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,720
霍克说他会在船长眼皮子底下偷偷带我们下船
Hawk said he could get us off the ship without the Captain knowing.

450
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,000
他的一番话让我们觉得新加坡很给力
He made Singapore sound so exciting.

451
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,600
植物园里的抽彩和猴子
The Raffles and monkeys in the Botanical Gardens.

452
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:10,800
那些都是吉娜想要看的
That's what Gina wanted to see.

453
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,440
她会没事的 是吧?
She's going to be OK, isn't she?

454
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,512
山姆 我可以跟你私下说两句吗? 
Sam, can I have a word? 

455
00:36:16,513 --> 00:36:17,240
怎么了?
Why, what's the matter?

456
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:22,360
情况很微妙 是关于艾奎斯特先生的钱
It's a delicate situation. Mr Edquist's money.

457
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,980
他对于这笔钱怎么花要求很明确
He's being very specific about what it can and cannot be used for.

458
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,386
他在说什么?  
What is he talking about?  

459
00:36:28,387 --> 00:36:30,279
他不会帮吉娜付赎金的
He won't pay for Gina's release.

460
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,200
- 什么?! - 听着 我很遗憾
- What?! - Look, I am sorry.

461
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,280
他怪吉娜让你卷入这个麻烦
He blames Gina for getting you into this mess.

462
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,000
我会跟堪培拉的人谈
I will speak to Canberra.

463
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,360
我会试着用别的方法来筹齐这笔赎金
I will try and raise the ransom money some other way.

464
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,160
- 这要多长时间? - 很长
- How long will that take? - Too long.

465
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,760
不 山姆 这笔钱已经不能用了
No, Sam. This money is quarantined.

466
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,360
不要再想了
It is off the table.

467
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:35,720
安德森先生 真的有必要这样吗?
Mr Anderson, is this really necessary?

468
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,920
如果出了什么岔子 我有不在场证明
If things go bad, then I have an alibi.

469
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,000
你们从我这里偷了那笔钱
You stole that money from me.

470
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,102
安德森先生不和我们一起吗?  
Mr Anderson not joining us? 

471
00:37:47,103 --> 00:37:48,480
不了 他现在很忙
No, he's tied up right now.

472
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:39,820
- 你怎么看? - 我们先看看什么情况
- What do you think? - Let's see what's going on first.

473
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:41,300
如果我们冲进去 他可能会紧张
If we bust in, he might panic.

474
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,540
他在屋里 里面还有其他人
He's in there with at least one other.

475
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:44,000
那是凯・索的人 我会组织突袭
That was Kay Song's men. I'll organise a raid.

476
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,720
她可能活不了那么长
She's not going to live that long.

477
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,240
- 你去哪儿? - 去试试把她带回来
- Where are you going? - To try and get her back.

478
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,840
嘿 山姆!
Hey, Sam!

479
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,440
- 嘿 - 敢碰我 你就死定了
- Hey. - Touch me, you're dead.

480
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,520
来坐吧 国际友人 我们有很多要庆祝的呢
Oh, come sit, my Ang mo friend. We have much to celebrate.

481
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,840
今天我赚了不少钱
Today I made a lot of money,

482
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,880
干掉了仇敌 恢复了我爷爷的名声
spilled the blood of my enemy, restored my grandfather's honour.

483
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,480
我都不知道要怎样感谢你
I'm not quite sure how to thank you.

484
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,160
告诉我那个女孩在哪
Just tell me where the girl is.

485
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:50,400
我们从不绑架白人女孩 没人跟你说过吗?
We don't kidnap white girls. Didn't anyone tell you?

486
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,720
那她到底在哪?
Then where is she?

487
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:57,760
这就是你的计划? 来这里向我提要求?
So that's your plan? Come in here, demand things from me.

488
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,960
你应该感激我没当场把你干掉
You should be grateful I don't kill you where you stand.

489
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,880
你刚刚还说你要谢谢我
You just said you wanted to thank me.

490
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,120
你没看到吗?
You don't see, do you?

491
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:16,200
我的人到的时候 你的公主正和霍克数钱呢
When my men arrived, your princess was counting money with Hawk.

492
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,800
坐下吃点吧
So sit and eat.

493
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:23,560
别为她流泪了
Oh, don't go shedding tears for her.

494
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,920
卡米拉没事 就是担心吉娜
Camilla's fine, just worried about Gina.

495
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,960
安德森先生情况越来越差了
Mr Anderson's gone into a steep decline.

496
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,040
哈 我保证他会活着
Ha. I'm sure he'll live.

497
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,160
我不明白 她会去哪?
I don't understand. Where would she go?

498
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,480
吉娜说了什么? 霍克告诉他们的地方?
What did Gina say? The places Hawk told them about?

499
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:51,600
- 是的 抽彩和... - 植物园的猴子
- Yes, Raffles and...- The monkeys in the garden.

500
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,980
吉娜・克肖?
Gina Kershaw?

501
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,820
拜托 别跑了 没事的
Please, don't run. It's alright.

502
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,680
你是谁?
Who are you?

503
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:11,480
我是山姆 我刚刚和卡米拉在一起来着
I'm Sam. I was just with Camilla.

504
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:18,280
- 她怎么样? - 她没事
- How is she? - She's fine.

505
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,680
她很担心你
She's worried about you.

506
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,760
我知道
I know.

507
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,720
你跟霍克一起参与了这件事 对吗?
So you and Hawk were in this together, were you?

508
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,840
她是你最好的朋友 为什么你要那么做?
She's your best friend. Why would you do that?

509
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:48,040
她和我 我们计划了一年了
She and I, we planned it for a year.

510
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:53,600
我省吃俭用
I saved up every penny I had.

511
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:58,100
我们俩 一路去了伦敦
The two of us, all the way to London.

512
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:02,200
我们要告诉全世界我们能独立完成
We were going to show the world we could do it on our own.

513
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:12,120
船长袭击她以后 她一心想回家
When the Captain attacked her,she just wanted to go home.

514
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:17,120
我恳求她
I begged her.

515
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,249
对她来说钱不是问题 
Money was never a problem for her 

516
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:22,660
但我没足够的钱一个人生存
and I couldn't afford to stay on alone,

517
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:25,360
如果我回去了 我就一无所有
and if I went home, I would be left with nothing

518
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:28,480
然后我又得重新开始省吃俭用
and I would have to start saving all over again.

519
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,600
我们之间有约定
We made a promise to each other.

520
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:55,700
哈里森 来杯威士忌?
Harrison. Whisky?

521
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:10,820
你要我怎么做 我就怎么做
I'll do what you want.

522
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:12,580
那当然啦
Well, of course you will.

523
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:14,180
你又不傻
You're not stupid.

524
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,430
我想要每周一份报告 
I'll expect a report, weekly, 

525
00:47:16,431 --> 00:47:18,940
关于在兰利总部的人的动向
on what our friends at Langley are doing.

526
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:22,380
每周五交给我 一份也不能少 明白了么?
Every Friday. Don't miss a report. Are we clear?

527
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:30,300
哈里森
Harrison.

528
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:35,740
没什么好值得羞愧的
The shame goes away.

529
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:39,940
振作起来吧
Chin up.

530
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:43,220
这下你是货真价实的间谍了
You're a real spy now.

531
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:53,860
亲爱的 你真应该跟我们一起晚餐
Oh, darling, you really should come and join us for dinner.

532
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:57,380
不行啊 弗兰克会在那的
I can't. Frank will be in there.

533
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:01,700
你不能告诉你丈夫你为了别人离开他
You can't tell your husband you've left him for someone else

534
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:03,420
然后还跟你丈夫一起吃晚餐
and then sit down for dinner with him.

535
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:09,460
- 你不属于唐人街 - 那我属于哪儿?
- You don't belong in Chinatown. - Where do I belong?

536
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:13,860
我得跟山姆在一起
I have to be with Sam.

537
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:15,420
我想跟他在一起
I want to be with him.

538
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:26,940
好吧
Alright.

539
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:29,020
那你去吧
Well, off you go, then.

540
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,014
好了 我把吉娜交给了斯图尔特 
Well, I left Gina with Stuart. 

541
00:48:45,015 --> 00:48:47,020
没提绑架的事
Didn't mention the kidnapping.

542
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:50,100
我想如果他够聪明 他自己会发现的
I suppose if he's smart enough,he'll work it out for himself.

543

我都不能朝他发火
I don't even get to scream at him

549
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:24,940

554

这里的生活不是你想象的那样

你... 你不属于这里

565
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:06,820
你还没告诉他吧?
You haven't told him yet, have you?

566
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:10,940
- 所以你仍然可以... - 没错

572
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:48,340
因为澳洲政府...

00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,500
- 迈卡! - 太忙了 没法

574
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:52,220
让正义得到伸张

575
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:53,565
那个人是军人! 
That man's a soldier! 

576

可能她调查得比迈卡想得还要深

580
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:05,060
有没有可能你朋友就犯过错呢?

Maybe I don't want to find out.Maybe I did it.
