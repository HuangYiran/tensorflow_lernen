{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was here 'cause I'd gotten a call for my regular fee.

00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Pray tell. - It's winter.

00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They shut down the park during the winter.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's "they"?

00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:52,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The people who really own this park.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah?

22
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The OSS is looking for me?

23
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, I'm no longer an agent. I can't help you.

24
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whatever it is, it's your problem.

00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Leave me alone!

00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd been burned by the agency. The OSS.

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I left. No going back.

00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was standing in line

32
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to buy my copy of the biggest virtual-reality game in history..

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It goes online at midnight. Pretty exciting, I suppose.

34
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Game Over.

00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The biggest video game to ever be created, period.

36
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is a worldwide event.

37
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:02,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The game was created by someone known only as the Toymaker,

38
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}who was once again unavailable for interviews.

39
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But there 's gotta be some things more important than games.

40
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, and did we mention the surprises the Toymaker has in store

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for those of you that complete level five?

42
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:31,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Untold riches, toys, and prizes beyond your wildest dreams.

43
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, no cutting in line, freak.

44
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wasn't cutting. I was standing right here!

45
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:38,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}End of the line!

46
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Needless to say,

47
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:44,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}things have been pretty lame since I left the OSS.

48
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Things were about to get worse.

49
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dear Juni,

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Miniaturized sharks.

52
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:13,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember, they're still man-eaters, so don 't be poking your fingers in the bowl.

53
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:18,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take care. If you guys ever need anything, I'll be there.

57
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:50,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Whatcha doin'? - Hi , Gerti.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just doing nothing... again.

59
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What's that? - Mexican chocolate.

61
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was my idea not to be part of the family business.

62
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're all on missions. Your sister, too, huh?

63
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:11,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I haven't seen Carmen since Christmas... Iast year.

64
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should join back up. The OSS could really use you.

65
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah. Use me. - Not what I meant.

66
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't hold on to the past, Juni. Look at me.

67
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}9 years old and nowhere to go but up.

68
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:26,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The only tribe worth belonging to is the one that you're born into.

69
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:29,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, your family. It's good to take care of your family.

70
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But remember one thing.

71
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everyone's your family.

72
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:38,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That makes no sense.

73
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:44,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello, Juni.

74
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. President.

75
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, you can call me Devlin.

76
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Weren't you already running the country when you were head of the OSS?

77
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was running the country.

78
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But since the OSS is a secret organization, no one knrw it.

79
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wanted the world to know that I was in charge.

80
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I became president of the United States.

81
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It all depends upon your preference.

82
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Reality or perception. Perception works for me.

83
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:09,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I'm into reality.

84
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the reality is, nothing you can say

85
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}will make me rejoin the OSS. That is why you called, isn't it?

86
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The OSS needs you to return.

87
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm retired.

88
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, who's living in perception now?

89
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The fact is there is no retirement.

90
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Once an agent, always an agent.

91
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's time for you to be a big boy and reinstate.

92
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:32,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With all due respect, sir, no.

93
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:36,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then hold on to your seat, because here's the reality:

94
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your sister's missing.

95
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:51,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Taking Agent Cortez to Games and Theory.

96
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's ex-Agent Cortez.

97
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, that one's defective.

98
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:02,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something's wrong with the shape.

99
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See if we can take that one back.

100
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, man.

101
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're on.

102
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're on!

103
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello, Juni.

104
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Donnagon. Been a good boy lately?

105
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:23,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

106
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Very, very good.

107
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mrs. Giggles must have straightened you out.

108
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:33,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I certainly did. - Hello, Francesca.

109
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:36,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, she worked me over pretty good, actually.

110
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Aah. - Darling, behave.

111
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you know about a video game called Game Over?

112
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:46,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know that just about every kid in the world is gonna sign on and play it.

113
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:49,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not if we can help it. The game is a trap.

114
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:52,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Once plugged into the game,

115
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}parents won't even be able to get their children's attention.

116
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What else is new?

117
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is different.

118
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:02,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Once you get through the game, your mind belongs to the Toymaker.

119
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The inventor of the game.

120
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He wants to enslave the world's youth with mind control.

121
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:11,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You control the youth, you control the future of the world.

122
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's an ingenious hacker, your sister.

123
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We sent her inside to shut down the game.

124
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:21,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But... she disappeared.

125
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:24,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How can she disappear inside a game?

126
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She didn't physically.

127
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Actually, she's right here in the building.

128
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Carmen! Carmen!

129
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:36,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She can't hear you. Her mind's still in the game.

130
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:40,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She got as far as level four, then nothing.

131
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why would she even go in there without any backup?

132
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:47,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because her first and only choice wouldn't answer our calls.

133
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:51,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So she decided to go alone.

134
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, you go in. Find your sister.

135
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Help her shut down the game in 1 2 hours,

136
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or it's game over for everyone.

137
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:03,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you with us?

138
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK.

139
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:06,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then let's go.

140
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:12,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I have to shut down the game but not release the Toymaker?

141
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Exactly. It would be catastrophic if he escaped.

142
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The T oymaker hates us for imprisoning him in cyberspace all these years.

143
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What made you do that? - Who knows? It was years ago.

144
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:26,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, you'll have to start on level one like everyone else.

145
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Find your sister on level four. Then proceed to level five.

146
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Which is unwinnable. - Level five is unwinnable?

147
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Level five is where you shut down the game.

148
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If the game is not shut down,

149
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:41,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you'll stay trapped with everyone else when the Toymaker takes over the world.

150
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Put on these glasses,

151
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you'll enter the world of the game.

152
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:55,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're being sent into a zero-gravity chamber alongside Carmen.

153
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That should give you a competitive edge.

154
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When you're in the game, things will feel real.

155
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are they real?

156
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good luck, Juni.

157
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Find Carmen. Shut down the game.

158
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And whatever you do, don't let the Toymaker out.

159
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Computer-generated.

160
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Low-res!

161
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Carmen. Carmen, can you hear me?

162
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:49,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's Juni, your brother.

163
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pogo T oads!

164
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:58,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey! Get your own ride, creepo!

165
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:01,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry! I thought you were a toad.

166
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nrw player, huh?

167
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. New player.

168
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:09,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, here's a lesson you won't soon forget.

169
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How is he?

170
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His brain waves are normal.

171
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But how is he?

172
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:29,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh. He fell.

173
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:44,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stand up.

174
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You fell three stories.

175
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:52,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aah. I survived?

176
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not exactly. That is your life count.

177
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:00,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After taking heavy damage, you lose a life.

178
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:02,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happens when I hit zero?

179
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Game over.

180
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:09,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When you run out of life, you lose. No replays. No restarts.

181
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:15,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happened to my 1 2 hours? I only have four now.

182
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:18,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Time flies when you're playing games.

183
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is crazy.

184
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Better hurry.

185
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So who are you?

186
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm Juni Cortez, ex-secret agent of the OSS.

187
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:52,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need to get to level five.

188
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:56,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I only have a frw hours before the T oymaker takes over the world.

189
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Level five? - Level five is unwinnable.

190
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I understand that. But I have to save the world.

191
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:05,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rez, this person thinks he's level-five material.

192
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I hear.

193
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:12,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You guys must be beta testers.

194
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:16,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One of the first allowed to roam free these coveted digital hills, my friend.

195
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How can I offer service?

196
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:21,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm Rez.

197
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi, Rez. Now, about saving the world.

198
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:28,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If anyone's gonna get to the great prize at level five,

199
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it's gonna be one of us.

200
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:32,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whatever. I want cheat codes.

201
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Back-door entrances. Shortcuts. Anything.

202
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can pay you with bonus packs.

203
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Implementation of any form of hack code or cheat boost

204
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}will trigger an immediate game over

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's in your tech manual.

207
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:50,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have to play the game by the rules

208
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or not at all.

209
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The way to get there is by hitting that target and bouncing to it.

217
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:17,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not a lot of realism in these games, is there?

309
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So there's no lack of communication amongst us.

310
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What I want, what we want...

311
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do we want?

312
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:40,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our time on this planet is over. It belongs now to our youth.

313
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:42,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not if we control their minds!

314
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:46,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We could start the world over again and cure it of its diseases.

315
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We could begin anrw.

316
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:59,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Forget what we could do! It's what we should do!

317
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:03,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Am I doing the right thing?

318
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:07,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not about the right thing. It's about the smart thing.

319
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:11,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We won't escape this place otherwise.

320
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I speak for all of us when I say, "We want out!"

321
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:18,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The end justifies the means.

322
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:21,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have the children's attention.

323
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:24,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The question is, what are you teaching them?

324
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who are you people?

325
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are you.

326
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:32,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Forgive me. Forgive me.

327
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:36,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I forget the extent of my programming powers from time to time.

328
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:42,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For a moment, I actually believed that you existed.

329
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Goodbye.

330
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Out, out, out.

331
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Out, out.

332
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This childish game will soon be over.

333
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:58,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then the real game will begin.

334
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:22,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will you look at this?

335
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:29,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold on to your joysticks, boys. I think we got him.

336
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're the Guy.

337
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm the who?

338
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:38,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Guy. The guy from the poster.

339
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That guy.

340
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Wait a minute.

341
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:48,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm only looking for my sister. She's somrwhere on level four.

342
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:51,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then I'm heading out through level five.

343
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you can win the game?

344
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess that's one way of putting it.

345
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see, according to the tech manual,

346
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if we find the Guy...

347
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:04,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the Guy...

348
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:06,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he'll lead us through the unwinnable level.

349
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:09,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just 'cause he made it out of Robocon in one piece

350
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:10,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}doesn't mean he's the Guy.

351
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:13,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's the first I've seen to make it out with the power suit.

352
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:17,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Man, give me a break. This wimp's a phony.

353
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's only one way to find out.

354
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mega Race.

355
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:28,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The fastest, most dangerous race in the game world.

356
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:29,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Come on. - No. Wait.

357
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:30,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I already told you I'm not the Guy.

358
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:32,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Go. - OK.

359
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:37,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The race will begin shortly.

360
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:40,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Claim your vehicle.

361
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:50,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got to be kidding.

362
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This race will tell us if you're the Guy.

363
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you are, you can hang with us.

364
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:59,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But if you're a phony, Arnold will crush you.

365
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not the Guy.

366
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:06,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How many times do I have to say it?

367
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:08,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There are no rules in this race,

368
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:12,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}except win at any cost.

369
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right!

370
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:46,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll try to help you out... as much as we can.

371
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:49,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The race will begin... now.

372
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One, two, three, go!

373
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:21,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Easy as pie. - Juni , push the red button.

374
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:24,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The one that says "Do not push"?

375
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Push it. It's a turbo boost.

376
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Are you sure? - Yeah.

377
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:44,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Rez, give me a hand!

378
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, how about a foot?

379
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My turn, sucker.

380
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:12,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're supposed to be winning the race, Juni.

381
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grandpa!

382
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:42,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is this?

383
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:21,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The glove!

384
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:23,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grab the glove.

385
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The glove!

386
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:53,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grab another bike, Juni!

387
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Final stretch!

388
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Five... four...

389
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}three... two... one.

390
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:42,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Winner by a hubcap, Juni Cortez!

391
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I thought you were him. - I knrw it.

392
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess you are.

393
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:15,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, I hear you're the Guy.

394
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:18,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am definitely the Guy.

395
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:42,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- So now what, Guy? - I have to go talk to my grandfather.

396
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:44,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To who?

397
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:46,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean I must confer

398
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:52,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with the Wizard of Atari-Sega-Nendo.

399
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:56,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. OK, cool.

400
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:05,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Congratulations. You won the race.

401
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:08,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But now they think I'm some important guy who's going to win for them.

402
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For our purposes, that's very good.

403
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:15,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They can lead us to level four more quickly,

404
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:17,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so you can find your sister,

405
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:20,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so we can shut down the game and make things right.

406
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:25,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And so that I can find...

408
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:30,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're not supposed to get near the Toymaker.

409
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:35,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So say the rules of the OSS,

410
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}which I'm not following.

411
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:41,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He might escape. We can't risk that.

412
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:43,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no, Juni.

413
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:47,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't plan on letting him go anywhere.

414
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guy!

415
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:52,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll talk about this later.

416
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK. Here it is.

417
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not supposed to lead you to level five.

418
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're supposed to lead me there.

419
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you mean we work together?

420
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:06,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The wizard said if we all work together, we all win.

421
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:08,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With my strength.

422
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My brains.

423
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:12,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My cool.

424
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My intuition.

425
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:20,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK. So you're the Guy. We're all counting on you.

426
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:23,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But if you fail us or if you're not who you say you are,

427
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:27,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}this life counter will hit zero faster than you can say "oops."

428
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:29,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Deal.

429
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}First I got to find my sister.

430
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So level four, people.

431
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Move!

432
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:45,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Grandpa.

433
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:48,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's doing good, huh? Huh?

434
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, he's doing great, and that's the problem.

435
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:52,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why?

436
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They've awoken the Programmerz.

437
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:55,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

438
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:59,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Pull him out of there now. - Too late.

439
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:05,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. This is cool.

440
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll get there in no time.

441
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:10,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is this?

442
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait a minute.

443
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Programmerz.

444
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:24,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who are these Programmerz?

445
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:26,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The brainiacs who wrote the book for the game.

446
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:31,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, they work for the Toymaker, huh?

447
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:34,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Programmerz are the reason you found us on level one.

448
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:36,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They caught Francis cheating during the Mega Race.

449
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:39,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They'll bounce us back to level one again if they catch us.

450
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:42,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Level one? I don't have time for that.

451
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Spread out.

452
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't split up! It never works!

453
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If we just stick together...

454
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:55,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, Grandpa. I guess it's just you and me.

455
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

456
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:00,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grandpa?

457
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:13,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you at least try and act like you're the Guy?

458
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:15,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know my secret?

459
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:18,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've seen the real Guy, and you're not him.

460
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:22,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are Programmerz chasing us?

461
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:24,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Someone's got a game cheat.

462
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's this?

463
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:26,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A map to the game.

464
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:28,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is illegal.

465
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want to find your sister or not?

466
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give me the map.

467
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:37,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK.

468
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:39,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're in Machine City.

469
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:42,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If we cut across here, we'll be able to reach level four.

470
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where Carmen is.

471
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right.

472
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:47,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then, if we cut through Lava Mountain,

473
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:50,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we'll be right at the door of the unwinnable level.

474
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:54,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shortcuts. This is good. This is very good.

475
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:56,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Game cheats.

476
00:39:57,790 --> 00:40:00,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's against the rules.

477
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:06,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're gonna have to bounce you back to level one.

478
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:09,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Aah! - You can't scare us. He's the Guy.

479
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:11,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grandpa!

480
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:16,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen to that, Edog. The Guy is calling his grandpa.

481
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:20,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm so scared. Come and get me, Gramps.

482
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:23,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's he gonna do, drool on us?

483
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:27,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are you picking on my grandson?

484
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:29,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why?

485
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:33,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They got Logos and Edog, the leaders.

486
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:36,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are Programmerz?

487
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's see what you really look like, huh?

488
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:45,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Very unimpressive.

489
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Computer nerds.

490
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:51,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now tell me, where is the Toymaker?

491
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:55,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grandpa... uh, Wizard, put them down!

492
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:11,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's good.

493
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:14,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The boy warrior is very, very good.

494
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:15,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But he's got to keep going.

495
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:17,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We run the risk of discouraging him

496
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:20,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if the next levels are too challenging.

497
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:22,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But only by seeking challenges

498
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:25,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}can we hope to find the best in ourselves.

499
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can we help him?

500
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:29,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! It's against the rules of the game!

501
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:31,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This isn't a game.

502
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:34,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's life!

503
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:38,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't mind talking to myself.

504
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:42,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But when you guys start to cut me out of the conversation,

505
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:46,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that's when it gets a little strange.

506
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:50,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's it. More life is what we need.

507
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:55,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll grant the boy a gift. The gift of life.

508
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:03,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry, Guy.

509
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:05,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}From here on out, I'll protect you.

510
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:08,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you all right, Guy?

511
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:11,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey. He found a life pack.

512
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:12,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A what?

513
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,290

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Juni, I can't.

523

524
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course he does.

525
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:58,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I owed you from the Robot Arena.

526
00:42:58,370 --> 00:43:03,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Also, I don't want anything to happen to you.

527

00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:24,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wish my family could see this amazing place.

530
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:27,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing in the game, Arnold?

531
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:40,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, actually, I got in on a beta tester's visa.

532
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:43,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm here for the great prize behind level five.

533
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:46,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It'll save my family from poverty.

534
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But what waits for us in level five?

535
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:51,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, is it all true? Untold riches?

536

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Don't tell me.

539
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want it to be a surprise.

540
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sure it will be.

541
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Attention, gamers!

543
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:13,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Choose your best player.

544
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:16,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Guy. The Guy's the best.

546
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:22,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That'd be Arnold.

547
00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:38,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Survival of the fittest.

548
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:40,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Face your opponent.

00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:46,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait a minute. I'm not fighting Arnold.

550
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:47,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't want to crush Juni.

551
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:51,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The winner shall proceed with the others to level four.

552
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:53,580

00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:58,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and will be evacuated permanently from the game.

554
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Arnold , I have to save my sister.

555

00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:05,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I have my own family to think about.

557
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:08,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't beat you , Arnold.

558

560
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:01,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not that I'm rooting for anyone in particular,

561
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:04,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but that was a really cool move.

562

604
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We might be close enough that it'll work.

605

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Exactly.

617
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:17,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If Grandpa tries to take revenge, the Toymaker will break free.

618
00:50:18,010 --> 00:50:19,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's that powerful.

619
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:24,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then we have to convince Grandpa that revenge is not the way to solve it.

620
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:26,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK, Guy. We found your pal.

621
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:29,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, where are we going, exactly? Where's level five?

622
00:50:29,590 --> 00:50:32,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}First of all, you don't ask the questions around here.

623
00:50:32,090 --> 00:50:34,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I do. Second of all--

624
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:37,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We're going to Lava Mountain. - We are?

625
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Beyond that is the passage to level five.

626
00:50:40,770 --> 00:50:41,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think so.

627
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:44,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, so suddenly you're the game expert.

628
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:46,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're following the Guy.

629
00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:52,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, Juni, we don't need these guys following us.

630
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not where we're going.

631
00:50:53,410 --> 00:50:55,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I promised them they could tag along.

632
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:59,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, this is how I knowwhere to go. Trust me.

633
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:04,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lava Mountain.

634
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:07,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why is it that every video game has lava in it?

635
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:09,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Technically, that's not true.

636
00:51:09,490 --> 00:51:11,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no lava in Halo.

637
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:13,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And in Metroid, it's molten magma.

638
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:16,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can't touch the lava, or it's game over.

639
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:17,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I have six lives left.

640
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:20,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Doesn't matter. You fall in, you lose.

641
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:23,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The game's getting tougher, guys.

642
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is impossible.

643
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:27,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you think, Grandpa?

644
00:51:27,810 --> 00:51:29,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Difficult.

645
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go another way. Follow me, boys.

646
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:36,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This doesn't make any sense.

647
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I give them a map.

648
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:40,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I give them the girl.

649
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:43,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What more do they want?

650
00:51:43,090 --> 00:51:45,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can't I just lead them to the door?

651
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:47,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Impossible, sir. The way the game's A.I. works is--

652
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:49,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know. I know.

653
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:51,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I just talk to myself at least?

654
00:51:51,070 --> 00:51:53,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are talking to yourself. I am you.

655
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:57,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, then, you, me, shut up.

656
00:51:57,810 --> 00:51:59,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So be it.

657
00:51:59,310 --> 00:52:00,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Am I insane?

658
00:52:00,610 --> 00:52:02,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Completely.

659
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:09,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're going the wrong way.

660
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have to drive them to level five.

661
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:20,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Send in the Tinker Toys.

662
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:25,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Finding another path. Now, this is good thinking.

663
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's good. We should listen to her more often.

664
00:52:27,810 --> 00:52:31,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Stay off my side. - OK.

665
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:39,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is this?

666
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:52,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tinker Toys!

667
00:52:55,670 --> 00:52:59,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait! What's worse, lava or Tinker T oys?

668
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:02,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Definitely Tinker T oys.

669
00:53:02,410 --> 00:53:04,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Carmen, what do we do?

670
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:55,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rip that wave, Juni.

671
00:53:57,030 --> 00:53:58,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are they doing?

672
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:01,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're straying from the path.

673
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The T oymaker must be pushing them towards his lair.

674
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:06,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But why? What could he gain from...

675
00:54:07,570 --> 00:54:10,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Check if there's a connection between the grandfather and the Toymaker.

676
00:54:10,910 --> 00:54:13,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hurry, people!

677
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:15,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's coming on-screen.

678
00:54:15,810 --> 00:54:18,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Comrades turned enemies.

679
00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:22,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grandpa's gonna break the Toymaker out of the game.

680
00:54:22,450 --> 00:54:23,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop them.

681
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:26,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stir the lava. Bigger waves.

682
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:28,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lava monsters. Anything.

683
00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:30,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have to create obstacles for them.

684
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:31,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on!

685
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:33,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have to drown them.

686
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:37,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They'll get a game over and be evacuated from the game.

687
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:40,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can't risk letting the Toymaker out.

688
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:44,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do it.

689
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is nrw.

690
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Juni!

691
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:04,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Carmen!

692
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:09,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Francis!

693
00:55:10,870 --> 00:55:12,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Arnold!

694
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:18,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grandpa!

695
00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:21,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Me.

696
00:55:24,350 --> 00:55:25,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are they?

697
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:26,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They fell in.

698
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:30,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know, but they should have gotten a game over.

699
00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:32,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They should be back here, actually.

700
00:55:42,570 --> 00:55:46,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The lava. It's cold.

701
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:52,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This way, Juni. This way. We found a door to the next level.

702
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:54,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

703
00:55:56,850 --> 00:55:59,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought I was a goner.

704
00:56:00,450 --> 00:56:03,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I saw all my points flashing away before my eyes.

705
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:06,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All I could hear was my father saying , "You blrw it, Arnold."

706
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:09,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"No untold riches for you."

707
00:56:14,770 --> 00:56:16,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's Grandpa?

708
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:18,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. But he was here.

709
00:56:18,270 --> 00:56:20,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Isn't this a piece of his armor?

710
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:27,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Carmen, it's a passage. Help me open it.

711
00:56:27,950 --> 00:56:29,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Red flag, Rez.

712
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:32,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have to talk about the Guy. Highly sensitive.

713
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:34,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about him?

714
00:56:34,590 --> 00:56:36,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've been rereading my tech manual.

715
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It speaks of a deceiver within the game,

716
00:56:39,590 --> 00:56:42,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}who will mislead you down a path where no one will survive.

717
00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:44,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think Juni's the deceiver.

718
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:48,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you suggest?

719
00:56:48,230 --> 00:56:52,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll have to get rid of him or risk losing the game.

720
00:56:53,670 --> 00:56:55,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about his sister?

721
00:56:55,810 --> 00:56:57,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Her too.

722
00:57:01,950 --> 00:57:04,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- How much time do we have left? - Five minutes.

723
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:06,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happens in five minutes?

724
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:08,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This place gets flooded with players from around the world.

725
00:57:08,990 --> 00:57:11,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, great. Competition.

726
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:13,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Toymaker will take over their minds.

727
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:14,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's why we have to shut down the game.

728
00:57:14,990 --> 00:57:18,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Sh, Carmen! - What is she talking about?

729
00:57:19,230 --> 00:57:21,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You didn't tell them yet, did you?

730
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:22,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was getting around to it.

731
00:57:22,830 --> 00:57:24,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Deceivers.

732
00:57:24,970 --> 00:57:27,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about the other side of level five?

733
00:57:27,170 --> 00:57:30,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There is no other side. You'll be imprisoned in the game.

734
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:31,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Game over.

735
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:33,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're not letting you shut down this game.

736
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:37,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're gonna see how fast that counter can count backwards.

737
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:40,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have to go through me first, game boy.

738
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:43,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, listen to me. I'm the Guy.

739
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop saying you're the Guy.

740
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:47,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We all know that you're not the Guy.

741
00:57:47,690 --> 00:57:49,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's not the Guy.

742
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:56,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am.

743
00:57:59,170 --> 00:58:00,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you are?

744
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:03,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm the Guy.

745
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:05,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The real Guy.

746
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:06,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I say we go in,

747
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:09,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}beat this unwinnable level, and get to the other side,

748
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:13,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}where untold riches and a bounty fit for 1 0 kings awaits us.

749
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:14,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I knrw it.

750
00:58:14,650 --> 00:58:17,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, he's definitely the Guy.

751
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:20,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But it's unwinnable.

752
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing is unwinnable

753
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:30,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if we join together and battle as one.

754
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:32,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We play on each other's strengths

755
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:34,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and help cover each other's weaknesses.

756
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:35,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can accomplish anything.

757
00:58:35,870 --> 00:58:38,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And we will accomplish everything.

758
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:43,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But first let's go whip this unwinnable level

759
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and show it who's boss.

760
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:46,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you with me?

761
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah!

762
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:50,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stand aside.

763
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cake.

764
00:59:19,050 --> 00:59:20,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my.

765
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:29,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guy!

766
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:32,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK. You're the Guy again.

767
00:59:32,430 --> 00:59:34,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get us through this, Juni.

768
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:35,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But l...

769
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:47,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Demetra!

770
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:49,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Juni, quickly!

771
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:51,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I found the switch to shut down the game.

772
00:59:51,350 --> 00:59:52,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I also found the exit portal.

773
00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:54,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can all get out of here right now.

774
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:57,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How did you survive?

775
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There was a glitch in the game. I don't know.

776
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Juni, who is this?

777
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:04,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is Demetra, my girlf...

778
01:00:04,130 --> 01:00:06,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My friend. No, she's my--

779
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:09,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm his girlfriend. Who are you?

780
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:11,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm his sister.

781
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:14,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She gave me the map. The map that got us here.

782
01:00:14,770 --> 01:00:16,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Juni, she's not real.

783
01:00:17,610 --> 01:00:19,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you talking about?

784
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've been helping Juni win the game.

785
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:22,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What have you been doing?

786
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:24,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Playing prisoner. That's what.

787
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:27,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She set you up, Juni. She set us all up.

788
01:00:27,850 --> 01:00:30,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I... Juni, she's lying.

789
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:31,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's been the Toymaker's prisoner.

790
01:00:31,990 --> 01:00:34,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She could be brainwashed, for all we know.

791
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:37,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you want to win this game or not?

792
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:45,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's the reason this level's unwinnable.

793
01:00:45,370 --> 01:00:47,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's the deceiver.

794
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:49,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why?

795
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:50,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, Juni.

796
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:54,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But it's in my programming.

797
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:03,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Congratulations!

798
01:01:03,450 --> 01:01:07,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've made it to the end of the game! You won!

799
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:10,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Untold riches for all of you!

800
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:15,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And your prize is you get to stay... here.

801
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:18,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Welcome to the game.

802

803
01:01:25,810 --> 01:01:27,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the way out.

804
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:29,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All of you , quickly!

805
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:35,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait! We have to shut down the game.

806
01:01:35,250 --> 01:01:37,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I already did. The switch is right there.

807
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:38,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Are you sure? - Yes, yes.

808
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:41,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go. Quickly, quickly.

809
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:51,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Run, Grandpa!

810
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go. I'll hold it open.

811
01:01:53,740 --> 01:01:54,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go now!

812
01:01:55,810 --> 01:01:57,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Demetra.

813
01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:00,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't hold it open forever, Juni.

814
01:02:06,750 --> 01:02:08,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We made it.

815
01:02:09,090 --> 01:02:13,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here's our e-mail addresses. Just in case.

816
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:14,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Terrific.

817
01:02:15,930 --> 01:02:17,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're awesome, Grandpa.

818
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:20,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The way you took on those Tinker Toys.

819
01:02:21,770 --> 01:02:23,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're the coolest.

820

01:02:29,470 --> 01:02:32,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was real. Sort of.

822
01:02:33,510 --> 01:02:35,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks a lot, Guy.

823
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:49,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's wrong?

824
01:02:49,790 --> 01:02:52,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't want to leave, do you?

825
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:53,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How can I go back, Juni?

826
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:59,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In here, I can walk. I can run.

827
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:03,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you look at me like I'm some kind of superhero.

828
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:05,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are.

829
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:08,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Out there in the real world, to me.

830
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:10,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are.

831
01:03:10,110 --> 01:03:12,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, Juni.

832
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:14,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I shall go back if...

833
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:19,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if you promise me that even though I'll be in a wheelchair,

834
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:24,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that you will look at me no differently than you are now.

835
01:03:24,860 --> 01:03:31,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because on the inside, Juni, on the inside, I feel like this.

836
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:35,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I promise, Grandpa.

837
01:03:38,110 --> 01:03:39,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Time to go.

838
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:49,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Coming through. Coming through, please.

839
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:52,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Those video games are killers on the eyes, huh, kid?

840
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:54,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Agent Cortez, we'll take it from here.

841
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:56,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My grandson will handle this.

842
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:59,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't touch. This is Corinthian leather.

843
01:04:05,770 --> 01:04:06,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK.

844
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:10,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So tell me again how you shut off the game.

845
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:12,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know if we shut it down, exactly.

846
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We hit a switch, and it seemed to work.

847
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:16,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, it worked. The game's down.

848
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:19,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We just need to make sure we did this correctly.

849
01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:22,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Actually, Grandpa hit the switch.

850
01:04:22,420 --> 01:04:25,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cortez, are these the boys that were in the game with you?

851
01:04:25,430 --> 01:04:27,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We tracked them through their e-mail addresses.

852
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:31,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, that's them. They wouldn't know anything about...

853
01:04:31,230 --> 01:04:32,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, wait a second.

854
01:04:32,630 --> 01:04:35,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happened to Francis the Brain,

855
01:04:35,070 --> 01:04:37,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Arnold the Strong, and Mr. Cool?

856
01:04:37,170 --> 01:04:40,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, in the real world, I'm not that smart.

857
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not strong.

858
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:44,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not cool.

859
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:46,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Reality check.

860
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:49,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So who are you out here in the real world?

861
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:52,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Special Agent Cortez, we need you.

862
01:04:55,060 --> 01:04:57,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just Juni Cortez.

863
01:04:57,890 --> 01:05:02,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's have it, Grandpa. What switch did you hit exactly?

864
01:05:02,130 --> 01:05:04,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There were two switches side by side.

865
01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:06,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One switch shuts down the game.

866
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:08,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But the other releases the Toymaker.

867
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:10,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who was the idiot who designed that?

868
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:15,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you free the T oymaker by accident?

869
01:05:15,610 --> 01:05:18,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I freed the T oymaker. But it was no accident.

870
01:05:18,750 --> 01:05:21,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you want to stop the game?

871
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:24,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then you must defeat the T oymaker. It's the only way.

872
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:25,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You crazy old man!

873
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:27,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you know what you've done?

874
01:05:28,890 --> 01:05:31,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grandpa, revenge doesn't solve anything.

875
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:34,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will you trust me? You of all people?

876
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:36,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A message from the president.

877
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, what does he want?

878
01:05:39,130 --> 01:05:43,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm coming back to settle the score.

879
01:05:43,670 --> 01:05:45,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For imprisoning me.

880
01:05:45,970 --> 01:05:47,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For using me.

881
01:05:47,780 --> 01:05:49,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Devlin set us up?

882
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:50,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not Devlin.

883
01:05:51,550 --> 01:05:55,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All I wanted to do was right the wrongs.

884
01:05:55,650 --> 01:05:57,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Start over a new world.

885
01:05:57,420 --> 01:05:59,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A new chance,

886
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:03,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}where every.one would get a second chance!

887
01:06:04,490 --> 01:06:06,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But no.

888
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:12,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So now I'm taking this to the next level!

889
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:16,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Seismic activity off the map!

890
01:06:18,370 --> 01:06:19,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Earthquake!

891
01:06:19,470 --> 01:06:20,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}T ornado!

892
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:21,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hurricane!

893
01:06:22,510 --> 01:06:24,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Carmen , let's go!

894
01:06:24,550 --> 01:06:26,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everybody, relax!

895
01:06:44,430 --> 01:06:46,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Quick! Put your glasses on.

896
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:49,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the only way you can see what's really happening.

897
01:06:49,370 --> 01:06:52,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The game has entered the real world.

898
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:58,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's only one thing to do in a situation like this.

899
01:06:58,410 --> 01:06:59,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

900
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:03,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Call in the family. Calling all Cortezes.

901
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:08,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is it. This is it.

902
01:07:08,390 --> 01:07:09,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is it.

903
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:12,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The moment we've been waiting for.

904
01:07:12,590 --> 01:07:14,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

905
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:16,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nobody move. Nobody move!

906
01:07:16,770 --> 01:07:19,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nobody touch the brain. The fifth brain.

907
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:24,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is a historic moment.

908
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:27,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Probably the...

909
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:33,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Probably the most important...

910
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:34,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

911
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:39,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the most important moment of my life.

912
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:43,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No one can disturb me now.

913
01:07:43,190 --> 01:07:46,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I must activate the brain.

914
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:49,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now.

915
01:07:49,260 --> 01:07:50,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Cortez?

916
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:54,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your children called. Some sort of emergency.

917
01:08:06,610 --> 01:08:08,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I'm their uncle.

918
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:17,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad, you need these to see.

919
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:19,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Glasses, quick!

920
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:31,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Incoming.

921
01:08:49,990 --> 01:08:51,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This won't be easy.

922
01:08:57,070 --> 01:08:59,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's kick some metal.

923
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:10,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about all the other ones?

924
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:16,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We need more help. Our family isn't big enough.

953
01:11:39,630 --> 01:11:41,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Someone has to go up there.

01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:43,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And shut it down manually.

972
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:40,250
