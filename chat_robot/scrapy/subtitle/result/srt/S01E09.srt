1
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,591
我什么也看不到
I've never seen so much nothing.

2
00:00:18,633 --> 00:00:20,969
我也未曾白跑这么远过
I've never walked so far to see it.

3
00:00:21,011 --> 00:00:22,804
我也不知道怎么就知道
How was I to know the only structures on this planet

4
00:00:22,887 --> 00:00:24,973
这个星球上的生物就在星际之门附近
would be in the immediate area around the stargate?

5
00:00:25,306 --> 00:00:26,599
就在那儿
There's the gate.

6
00:00:26,641 --> 00:00:27,892
马上开启它
Dial it up.

7
00:00:27,976 --> 00:00:31,062
等等，能量表显示这里的读数
和一英里前的一样
Wait. The energy readings here are exactly
the same as they were a mile away.

8
00:00:31,354 --> 00:00:33,648
我认为我们应该停下来检查一下
I really think we should stay a while.

9
00:00:34,065 --> 00:00:35,608
我想你是讨厌穿上这身衣服吧
I thought you hated wearing these suits.

10
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,653
确实讨厌，身上很不舒服
可是能量表的读数太奇怪了
I do. I'm incredibly uncomfortable,
but these energy readings are amazing.

11
00:00:38,695 --> 00:00:40,280
看来有些东西在我们周围啊
It's like it's coming from all around us.

12
00:00:40,363 --> 00:00:41,948
你还无法对此解释吧？
And yet you cannot explain it.

13
00:00:41,948 --> 00:00:42,907
不见得
Not yet.

14
00:00:42,907 --> 00:00:44,701
你不是不知道如何用这东西吧？
You can't figure out a way we can use it?

15
00:00:45,201 --> 00:00:46,453
不见得
Not yet.

16
00:00:48,496 --> 00:00:49,414
好吧
All right.

17
00:00:49,456 --> 00:00:50,665
什么乱七八糟的
Then let's call it a mission.

18
00:00:50,707 --> 00:00:52,625
别，别，别啊
有一种叫纯科学的东西
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
There is such a thing as pure science.

19
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:54,711
不是所有的成功马上都可以拿来用的
Not everything has to be immediately useful.

20
00:00:55,962 --> 00:00:58,214
要知道，你说服我到这里来的根据
You talked me into coming here because you thought

21
00:00:58,256 --> 00:01:02,385
仅仅是因为你认为能量表的读数显示
这里可能存在外星文明
those energy readings indicated
the presence of a civilization.

22
00:01:02,594 --> 00:01:05,013
而这里没有建筑，没有生物，什么都没有
There are no buildings, no people, no nothing.

23
00:01:05,096 --> 00:01:06,348
只有雾
Just fog.

24
00:01:06,473 --> 00:01:08,141
严格的说这不是雾
It's not technically fog.

25
00:01:08,183 --> 00:01:10,310
空气中并没有水蒸气
There's no actual water vapor in the atmosphere.

26
00:01:10,435 --> 00:01:12,395
我的意思是
I mean, for that matter,

27
00:01:12,437 --> 00:01:14,522
我认为我们没必要戴这个头罩
I don't think we need to wear the hazmat gear.

28
00:01:20,779 --> 00:01:22,238
现在我告诉你
Now you tell me.

29
00:01:23,865 --> 00:01:25,367
把门打开
Dial the gate.

30
00:01:47,681 --> 00:01:48,932
我们回去吧
Let's move out.

31
00:01:49,057 --> 00:01:51,142
等等，等等，在等会
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on.

32
00:01:52,018 --> 00:01:53,186
你想留这儿
You wanted useful.

33
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:56,064
你说什么呀？
What are you talking about?

34
00:01:56,106 --> 00:01:57,148
当虫洞联通的时候
When the wormhole connected,

35
00:01:57,315 --> 00:01:59,067
能量场的读数有了很大的变化
there was a wild fluctuation in the energy field.

36
00:01:59,109 --> 00:02:00,652
如果我没有搞错的话
I mean, if I'm reading these numbers right,

37
00:02:00,694 --> 00:02:04,406
看来星际之门是从这里的空气中
吸取能量的
it looks like the gate is actually
drawing power from the atmosphere.

38
00:02:04,656 --> 00:02:05,448
那又如何？
So?

39
00:02:05,657 --> 00:02:06,324
那又如何？
So?

40
00:02:06,616 --> 00:02:08,410
据我所知，这个能量场绵延数英里
To the best of my knowledge, this field goes on for miles.

41
00:02:08,451 --> 00:02:10,537
我的意思是，可能覆盖了整个星球
I mean, for all we know, envelops the entire planet.

42
00:02:10,578 --> 00:02:11,705
我们身边就可能存在大量生物
We're talking about a lot of energy here.

43
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:12,956
大量生物是什么意思？
How much is a lot?

44
00:02:12,997 --> 00:02:14,833
以焦耳或尔格的形式存在
（焦耳，尔格均为能量单位）
Well, in terms of joules or ergs?

45
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:16,876
以什么形式存在？还很多？
In terms of... lots.

46
00:02:16,918 --> 00:02:18,753
是的，很多
Well, lots and lots.

47
00:02:18,962 --> 00:02:21,673
多得足够打开一个通往地球的虫洞
Enough to open a wormhole back to Earth.

48
00:03:17,645 --> 00:03:23,956
星际之门之亚特兰蒂斯
第一季第9集 回家
Season 1 : Episode 9
Home

49
00:03:29,866 --> 00:03:32,994
我觉得亚特兰蒂斯之门是唯一一个可
让我们返回地球的入口
I thought the atlantis gate was
the only one capable of dialing Earth.

50
00:03:33,036 --> 00:03:35,288
是的，可那是因为它是唯一一个
有着能量水晶球的地方
It is, but that's because it's the only one
with an additional control crystal

51
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:37,290
只要我们拥有它
它产生的能量足以让我们回去
that allows an eighth chevron to lock.

52
00:03:37,332 --> 00:03:38,792
可能是出于安全的原因？
It's probably a security measure.

53
00:03:39,042 --> 00:03:40,168
这没关系的
It doesn't matter.

54
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,753
只要我们得到能量控制水晶球
As long as we have the control crystal,

55
00:03:41,795 --> 00:03:43,171
我就有办法让其他星际之门运作起来
I can make the other gate work.

56
00:03:43,213 --> 00:03:45,340
你的意思是我们将DHD从这里带到
You're suggesting we remove it from our DHD

57
00:03:45,423 --> 00:03:48,843
M5S224上去
and bring it to M5S224?

58
00:03:48,968 --> 00:03:49,719
是的
Yes.

59
00:03:50,053 --> 00:03:51,763
有没有风险？
应该没问题的
- Isn't that risky?
- I'll be fine.

60
00:03:51,805 --> 00:03:54,849
我想她是要毁掉我们现在的星际之门
I think she means in terms of breaking our own gate.

61
00:03:54,933 --> 00:03:56,059
我知道我在做什么
I know what I'm doing.

62
00:03:56,142 --> 00:03:58,311
再说，水晶球要是没有足够能量的话是毫无用处的
Besides, the control crystal
is useless without enough power.

63
00:03:58,353 --> 00:04:00,730
可你说你不知道
能力从何而来啊？
You said you didn't know
where the energy was coming from.

64
00:04:00,772 --> 00:04:02,732
我相信能量来自于
I believe it is being generated somehow

65
00:04:02,774 --> 00:04:04,150
这里的空气中
in the atmosphere itself.

66
00:04:04,192 --> 00:04:05,235
雾？
The fog?

67
00:04:05,735 --> 00:04:06,569
是的
Yes.

68
00:04:06,611 --> 00:04:07,862
可你说这不是雾啊？
You said it wasn't fog.

69
00:04:08,154 --> 00:04:09,030
管他是什么呢
Whatever it is.

70
00:04:09,072 --> 00:04:09,864
你怎么知道呢？
Well, how do you know?

71
00:04:09,906 --> 00:04:10,990
我也不知道
I don't yet,

72
00:04:11,074 --> 00:04:13,368
可是这雾，或者水汽
不管你叫它什么
but the fog, or the mist,
or whatever you want to call it,

73
00:04:13,451 --> 00:04:16,162
是这数英里内仅有的东西
同时能量表的读数也一直保持恒定
is the only thing around for miles,
and the energy readings were constant.

74
00:04:16,496 --> 00:04:19,290
好的，即使你能搞清楚这件事
Okay, even if you can pull this off,

75
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,626
我们恐怕还得假设地球上
we have to assume that the Earth gate

76
00:04:21,668 --> 00:04:23,586
那通往神马星球的虫洞
lacks a power source capable of establishing

77
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,839
还是缺少足够的能量来发挥作用
a wormhole back to Pegasus.

78
00:04:26,506 --> 00:04:27,674
所以不管谁回去
So whoever went,

79
00:04:27,716 --> 00:04:29,884
可能要冒个风险
也就是说这可能是个单程的履行
it'd be taking the risk
that it might be a one-way trip.

80
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,636
我肯定有人会愿意冒这个险的
I'm sure someone will volunteer.

81
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,637
你？
You?

82
00:04:33,263 --> 00:04:37,017
不管你们相信如何，只要我知道还有
一丝机会回来的话，我也会选择回去
Believe it or not, I would only go if I knew
there was a good chance I could come back.

83
00:04:37,267 --> 00:04:39,519
至少我们可以给地上的长官带个信
At least, we can send a message to Stargate Command.

84
00:04:39,561 --> 00:04:41,021
让他们知道我们现在的情况还不错
Let them know we're okay.

85
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,940
我们已收集了很多的资料
We've gathered a lot of intel.

86
00:04:44,816 --> 00:04:47,444
如果可能的话，我们应当把他们
发回去
We should send it... if we can.

87
00:04:47,527 --> 00:04:49,612
即使通过无线电也好
Even if it's over a radio.

88
00:04:56,619 --> 00:04:57,662
好了
That's it.

89
00:05:00,081 --> 00:05:02,042
不知道把它安在
So how easy will it be to put that thing

90
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:03,209
其他地方会不会很容易
in the other DHD?

91
00:05:03,251 --> 00:05:04,419
亚特兰蒂斯的能量场是很独特的
The atlantis' DHD is unique.

92
00:05:04,461 --> 00:05:07,047
它不像一个空着的插槽
等着我们往里面查东西
It's not like the'll be an empty slot
waiting for us to plug it in.

93
00:05:07,255 --> 00:05:08,256
你的意思是？
Meaning?

94
00:05:08,381 --> 00:05:11,092
我的意思是可能还需要一些其他的
辅助部件
Meaning that there may be some disassembly required.

95
00:05:12,052 --> 00:05:13,636
你要把它带走
You want to take the DHD apart?

96
00:05:13,678 --> 00:05:15,430
我会重新把它放回去的
I'll put it back together again.

97
00:05:15,472 --> 00:05:17,932
你能不能别冒这个险去拆除其他的星际之门
Do you not run the risk of disabling the other Stargate?

98
00:05:17,974 --> 00:05:20,477
除非我翘辫子了
否则的话不大可能
Only if I screw up, which is extremely unlikely.

99
00:05:21,394 --> 00:05:23,063
840年
840 years.

100
00:05:23,438 --> 00:05:24,397
什么？
What?

101
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:25,857
这就是我们坐飞船去那里
That's how long it will take us

102
00:05:25,982 --> 00:05:27,942
要花的时间
to come get you by puddle jumper.

103
00:05:28,443 --> 00:05:29,944
虽然这样，你们仍然会这么做的，对吧？
But you would do that, right?

104
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:32,113
当然我们会这么做
Of course we would.

105
00:05:32,155 --> 00:05:33,365
唉，没必要这么做了
Well, it won't be necessary.

106
00:05:33,406 --> 00:05:35,283
不过，我可否申请带个帮手
However, I may require some assistance.

107
00:05:35,784 --> 00:05:36,826
少校？
Major?

108
00:05:36,993 --> 00:05:38,078
中尉？
Lieutenant?

109
00:05:38,578 --> 00:05:39,537
好的，长官
Yes, sir.

110
00:05:58,014 --> 00:05:59,766
亚特兰蒂斯，这是McKay
Atlantis, this is McKay.

111
00:06:00,016 --> 00:06:01,059
说吧
Go ahead.

112
00:06:01,101 --> 00:06:03,228
我们已准备好了要拆除DHD
We're ready to begin work on the DHD.

113
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:04,854
你对此有把握吗，Rodney？
You're sure about this, Rodney?

114
00:06:04,896 --> 00:06:07,565
是的，下次你听到我的呼叫时
肯定会听到好消息的
Positive. The next time you hear from us,
we'll be delivering the good news.

115
00:06:07,649 --> 00:06:08,692
祝你好运
Good luck.

116
00:06:08,775 --> 00:06:10,443
可能的话，我们回来吃晚饭
We'll be back  in time for supper.

117
00:06:12,112 --> 00:06:13,446
好的
All right.

118
00:06:16,074 --> 00:06:17,367
开始吧
Let's get started.

119
00:06:21,371 --> 00:06:22,414
进来
Come in.

120
00:06:24,499 --> 00:06:27,002
你好，有时间聊会吗？
Hi. Do you have a moment?

121
00:06:27,377 --> 00:06:28,753
有啊
Yeah, sure.

122
00:06:30,797 --> 00:06:32,257
“战争与和平”
"War and peace."

123
00:06:35,093 --> 00:06:36,511
呵，大部头的书啊
That's some heavy reading.

124
00:06:36,553 --> 00:06:38,847
是啊，在地球上准备这次任务时
Yep, back on Earth, when I was getting ready

125
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:41,224
我就曾想到可能在执行任务的期间
会有空闲时间
for this mission, I realized there was a good chance

126
00:06:41,307 --> 00:06:42,767
用来读读书
that I might be here for a while,

127
00:06:42,809 --> 00:06:44,853
所以我想，干嘛不带本书去呢
so I figured why not bring along a book

128
00:06:44,894 --> 00:06:46,646
消遣一下也好嘛
that takes a while to read.

129
00:06:47,856 --> 00:06:49,024
17页
Page 17.

130
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,525
我才开始读呢
I'm right on schedule.

131
00:06:53,111 --> 00:06:56,489
我想和你谈谈这个，回家如何？
That's kind of what I wanted to talk to you about, home.

132
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,158
回家？
Going home.

133
00:06:58,867 --> 00:06:59,784
哦
Oh.

134
00:07:01,327 --> 00:07:02,328
McKay是对的
McKay is right.

135
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:06,041
只要这办法行得通
就可以搭起通往地球的虫洞
If this works, and we are able
to establish a wormhole back to Earth--

136
00:07:06,082 --> 00:07:08,543
你知道，要是还继续讨论这个话题的话
我知道会讨论些什么
You know, if this conversation
is going where I think it's headed,

137
00:07:08,585 --> 00:07:10,420
你不必在说了
you can put your mind at rest.

138
00:07:10,503 --> 00:07:12,047
我哪儿也不去
I'm not going anywhere.

139
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,049
我书还没读完呢
I haven't read my book.

140
00:07:14,424 --> 00:07:20,930
我要说你是向Hammond将军汇报的
Look, all I'm saying is that you are the person

141
00:07:21,056 --> 00:07:23,767
最佳人选
who is best qualified to brief General Hammond

142
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:26,269
而且可以很好得解释幽灵将会给我们带来什么样的的危险
and the other powers that be about the Wraith threat.

143
00:07:26,311 --> 00:07:28,021
呃，也许吧
Well, maybe so...

144
00:07:28,772 --> 00:07:30,857
可是我认为这儿需要我
But I think I'm needed here.

145
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,317
好样的
Good.

146
00:07:32,359 --> 00:07:34,486
可是要是你愿意回去的话，我可以理解
But if you want to go, I understand that, too.

147
00:07:34,527 --> 00:07:36,237
你说什么，这里不需要我吗？
What are you saying, I'm not needed here?

148
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:37,739
我说我会理解的
I said I'd understand.

149
00:07:38,448 --> 00:07:41,201
那谢谢了，可是我曾许诺过
一定要完成任务的
Well, thank you, but I made a commitment.

150
00:07:41,326 --> 00:07:43,828
当然，可是这里的所谓外星生物
Of course, in all fairness, life-sucking aliens

151
00:07:43,953 --> 00:07:45,747
并不是在我们的计划之中的啊
weren't part of the brochure.

152
00:07:47,374 --> 00:07:50,627
不管如何，我会留在这儿的
Regardless, I'm staying.

153
00:07:50,752 --> 00:07:51,628
好的
Good.

154
00:07:52,337 --> 00:07:54,214
没有你的话，这儿真不知会变得怎样
Wouldn't be the same without you.

155
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,432
要是能搞好的话，你想不想回去？
So if this works, would you want to go back?

156
00:08:04,474 --> 00:08:06,518
我不认为回去很重要
I don't think it matters what I would want.

157
00:08:06,559 --> 00:08:07,477
为什么不？
Why not?

158
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:09,604
因为亚特兰蒂斯需要我啊
Because Atlantis can't afford to lose me.

159
00:08:09,938 --> 00:08:12,399
我是星际理论，虫洞物理学最前沿的
科学家啊
I'm their foremost expert in gate theory,
wormhole physics,

160
00:08:12,524 --> 00:08:14,984
而且我发现了许多被其他科学家们所忽视
and a myriad of other sciences too numerous to mention

161
00:08:15,068 --> 00:08:16,569
而又非常重要的东西
yet too important to ignore.

162
00:08:16,611 --> 00:08:17,987
我想见我奶奶
I'd love to see my grandma.

163
00:08:18,113 --> 00:08:19,823
她可能会认为我还在阿富汗执行任务呢
She thinks I'm somewhere in afghanistan or something.

164
00:08:19,948 --> 00:08:20,907
换句话说，要是有人回去的话
On the other hand, if anyone's going,

165
00:08:21,032 --> 00:08:22,701
一定要得到SGC的尊重
it should be someone
that commands the respect of the SGC

166
00:08:22,784 --> 00:08:25,453
要有耐心，有学识，有决心
and yet has the patience, knowledge, and determination

167
00:08:25,537 --> 00:08:28,707
让他们带一队人过来
to bring them up to speed and
find a way to bring the cavalry back here.

168
00:08:28,957 --> 00:08:31,584
你的意思是，你在哪里都是不可或缺的喽
So, what you're saying is you're invaluable everywhere.

169
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,586
当然，要是我走了的话，这里就没人能干活了
Granted, it would create a void if I were to go,

170
00:08:33,712 --> 00:08:36,423
可是你们可以乘机好好休息
我会在那边设法
but you can all take comfort in the knowledge
that I'll be on the other side,

171
00:08:36,464 --> 00:08:38,383
带一对援兵过来的
spearheading the effort to return with reinforcements,

172
00:08:38,466 --> 00:08:41,011
还有给养，衣服什么的
fresh supplies, and big macs for all.

173
00:08:41,094 --> 00:08:42,887
听你这么一说，我感觉好多了
I feel better already.

174
00:08:43,013 --> 00:08:44,264
嗯，好
Yeah, good.

175
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:50,895
Sheppard少校
Major Sheppard!

176
00:08:50,937 --> 00:08:52,522
你有没有接收到McKay博士发回的讯息
Have we heard back from Dr. McKay?

177
00:08:53,231 --> 00:08:54,149
还没有
Not yet.

178
00:08:54,315 --> 00:08:56,568
基地上传言已有了新的发现
Word of the discovery has
already spread throughout the base.

179
00:08:56,943 --> 00:08:58,111
我注意到了
I've noticed.

180
00:08:58,278 --> 00:08:59,821
当然了，这是意料之中的事情
It is to be expected, of course--

181
00:08:59,904 --> 00:09:02,365
马上就要回到亲人的身边
faced with prospect of being reunited with loved ones,

182
00:09:02,407 --> 00:09:04,284
回到熟悉的地面
returning to familiar ground.

183
00:09:04,659 --> 00:09:06,953
是啊，我真想回去啊
Yeah, I'd love to go back.

184
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:10,582
你会考虑离开亚特兰蒂斯？
You would consider leaving Atlantis?

185
00:09:10,623 --> 00:09:12,459
我只是希望我能再次回来
I just wish I knew I could gate back here.

186
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,169
激动一下也不错嘛
Then I'd go in a heartbeat.

187
00:09:14,544 --> 00:09:16,463
回到自己所属的世界可是一个大好事啊
It would be wonderful to see your world.

188
00:09:16,504 --> 00:09:18,131
汇报的时候你可以在一边帮我的
You could help me with the briefing.

189
00:09:19,507 --> 00:09:20,717
乐意效劳
I would like that.

190
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:23,345
嘿，你对天马星的了解可比任何人都详细啊
Hey, you know more about
the Pegasus galaxy than anyone.

191
00:09:23,595 --> 00:09:25,847
谈谈地球上的有趣的东西吧
Then there's all those
cool Earth things I've talked about,

192
00:09:25,972 --> 00:09:27,390
比如说足球，观光览车等等
football, ferris wheels...

193
00:09:27,515 --> 00:09:28,224
哦
Oh!

194
00:09:29,142 --> 00:09:31,519
你还记得我们最后一次吃苞米花的情景吗？
Do you remember the last of the popcorn we ate?

195
00:09:32,979 --> 00:09:34,689
我们本该再多吃点的
We can get more.

196
00:09:35,732 --> 00:09:37,609
可要是知道还会回去的话
If we knew we could return.

197
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,569
异常启动
<i>Unscheduled activation!</i>

198
00:09:42,947 --> 00:09:44,866
这是McKay博士发回的讯息
It's a radio transmission from Dr. McKay.

199
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:47,202
Rodney？
Rodney?

200
00:09:47,452 --> 00:09:48,286
Elizabeth
Elizabeth.

201
00:09:48,328 --> 00:09:49,496
我搞定了
I'm done.

202
00:09:49,537 --> 00:09:51,414
正如你所见的那样，部件已安装上DHD
The component's installed
in the DHD, and as you can see--

203
00:09:51,581 --> 00:09:52,665
好样的
Well done.

204
00:09:52,707 --> 00:09:55,043
可是，能量读数有没有什么变化？
Sorry, what about the energy readings?

205
00:09:55,251 --> 00:09:56,503
哦，和以前一样
Oh, same as before.

206
00:09:56,544 --> 00:09:59,297
所有迹象显示，星际之门从空气中汲取能量
All indications are that the gate's
drawing power from the atmosphere,

207
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:01,216
能量足可以一次送八个人
and there's enough for an eight-chevron lock.

208
00:10:01,257 --> 00:10:02,717
你在那儿别走
Okay, you stay put.

209
00:10:02,926 --> 00:10:04,844
我们马上过来
好的
- We're on our way.
- Great.

210
00:10:09,516 --> 00:10:11,893
现在我们，准备好了？
So are we, uh, ready?

211
00:10:12,602 --> 00:10:14,437
准备什么？
What's there to be ready for?

212
00:10:14,854 --> 00:10:16,523
呃，这可是件大事啊
Well, this is a big moment,

213
00:10:16,648 --> 00:10:18,358
我们已经好久没和地面联系了
and I thought we haven't been
in contact for some time--

214
00:10:18,441 --> 00:10:20,276
我们准备好了
开始吧
- We're ready.
- Go ahead.

215
00:10:29,244 --> 00:10:30,495
快点启动啊
Please work.

216
00:10:38,837 --> 00:10:42,048
星际之门总部，我是亚特兰蒂斯探险任务的
Stargate command, this is Dr. Elizabeth Weir

217
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,508
Elizabeth Weir博士
of the Atlantis expedition.

218
00:10:43,591 --> 00:10:44,926
能听到我说话吗？
Do you read?

219
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,974
在重复一遍，我是Weir博士
I repeat, this is Dr. Weir.

220
00:10:51,016 --> 00:10:52,475
请回答
Come in, please.

221
00:10:53,852 --> 00:10:56,146
我是星际之门总部的Harriman中士
This is sergeant Harriman of Stargate Command.

222
00:10:56,187 --> 00:10:58,690
不管你是谁，希望不要开玩笑
Whoever you are, this better not be a joke.

223
00:10:58,982 --> 00:11:00,692
这不是玩笑，中士
No joke, sergeant.

224
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:04,029
我马上发送个人编号让你确认
I'm sending my personal IDC for confirmation.

225
00:11:06,197 --> 00:11:07,782
刚才对不起了，Weir博士
Sorry about that, Dr. Weir.

226
00:11:07,907 --> 00:11:09,576
忽然收到你们的讯息真令人感到惊奇
We're just a little surprised to be hearing from you.

227
00:11:09,617 --> 00:11:10,869
可以理解
Understandable.

228
00:11:11,244 --> 00:11:12,537
同道已经打开
The iris is open.

229
00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:13,913
你们可以过来了
You're clear to come through.

230
00:11:14,122 --> 00:11:17,083
谢谢，可是我们还不想冒险来个单程旅行
Thanks, but we're not ready to risk a one-way trip.

231
00:11:18,877 --> 00:11:20,503
你不明白，博士
You don't understand, doctor.

232
00:11:20,545 --> 00:11:22,047
这边情况有变
Things have changed around here.

233
00:11:22,297 --> 00:11:24,591
从仙宫座到普洛米休斯的通道已经搭好
The asgard are in the process of fitting Prometheus

234
00:11:24,716 --> 00:11:27,218
其能量足以到达其他的星系
with engines capable of reaching other galaxies.

235
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,971
我们正打算派人来找你们呢
We were manning a mission
to find out what happened to you.

236
00:11:30,722 --> 00:11:32,140
他说的是真的么？
Is he serious?

237
00:11:33,058 --> 00:11:34,434
你说的是真的？
Are you serious?

238
00:11:34,601 --> 00:11:36,019
是的，长官
es, ma'am.

239
00:11:36,061 --> 00:11:39,606
现在过来吧，一个月之内你就可以再回到天马座了
Come through now, and you could
be back in Pegasus inside of a month.

240
00:11:44,903 --> 00:11:45,945
好的
Well...

241
00:11:46,905 --> 00:11:48,448
谁去？
Who's going?

242
00:11:56,706 --> 00:11:58,333
欢迎回到地球
Welcome back to Earth.

243
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:13,848
天马座星系确实存在许多的危险
And while the Pegasus galaxy does hold many dangers,

244
00:12:14,015 --> 00:12:18,186
我想我们有必要考虑
I feel its potential rewards
justify the risk of maintaining

245
00:12:18,269 --> 00:12:20,647
留在亚特兰蒂斯基地的必要性
a continued presence on the Atlantis base.

246
00:12:21,231 --> 00:12:23,817
不幸的是，博士，你的报告递交国防部后
Unfortunately, doctor, your preliminary report

247
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,236
引起了他们很大的震惊
has given the Pentagon cause for concern.

248
00:12:26,903 --> 00:12:28,905
如果幽灵的力量正像你们所说的那么强大的话
If the Wraith are as powerful as you say,

249
00:12:29,072 --> 00:12:32,242
那他们就是比Goa’uld还要危险的敌人了
that would make them an enemy
even more dangerous than the Goa'uld.

250
00:12:32,826 --> 00:12:34,744
有人认为我们有必要减轻我们的损失
There are those who believe it would be prudent

251
00:12:34,869 --> 00:12:38,248
必要的情况下可以放弃整个天马星系
to cut our losses and abandon
the Pegasus galaxy all together.

252
00:12:39,082 --> 00:12:40,083
将军，你不能——
General, you can't--

253
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:43,044
我们在谈论一种族类
他们曾击败过远古的人累
We are talking about a race that defeated the Ancients.

254
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:47,799
多年来，星际之门总部曾受到过
Over its years in operation,
Stargate Command has encountered

255
00:12:47,924 --> 00:12:51,761
多次可能会毁灭地球的危险
a number of threats that could well have brought
about the destruction of this world.

256
00:12:52,554 --> 00:12:54,264
可是，那些危险从未使你放弃
Now, that never stopped you from continuing

257
00:12:54,305 --> 00:12:56,349
继续派人进行探险，将军
to send teams through the gate, General.

258
00:12:57,225 --> 00:13:00,895
SG－1已经完成任务安全返回了
By the time SG-1 had returned from their first mission,

259
00:13:00,979 --> 00:13:03,023
可是同时也造成了损失
the damage had already been done.

260
00:13:03,106 --> 00:13:04,774
Goa’uld已经意识到我们的存在了
We'd alerted the Goa'uld to our presence

261
00:13:04,899 --> 00:13:07,402
结束探险项目什么都改便不了
and shutting down operations
wouldn't have changed that.

262
00:13:08,194 --> 00:13:11,114
可是，在幽灵这个问题上，我们仍有选择的余地
In the case of the Wraith, however, we have a choice.

263
00:13:11,406 --> 00:13:14,075
也就是说我们要夹着尾巴逃跑喽
So we're just going to turn tail and run?

264
00:13:14,617 --> 00:13:17,871
国防部会把这视为“战略撤退”
The Pentagon would prefer
to call it "a strategic withdrawal."

265
00:13:18,997 --> 00:13:21,082
可是我们如何保证他们不会尾随我们而来？
But how can we be sure they won't come after us?

266
00:13:21,124 --> 00:13:22,208
将军，他是对的
She's right, General.

267
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:25,670
他们以生命为食，现在他们知道地球上可以
够他们饱餐一顿了
They feed on human life forms, and now they know
there's a smorgasbord waiting for them here.

268
00:13:26,421 --> 00:13:28,256
我认为我们没有选择的余地
I don't think we have a choice.

269
00:13:28,506 --> 00:13:30,717
我们需要继续进行探索
We need to continue to explore the opportunities

270
00:13:30,842 --> 00:13:33,803
探索天马座可能存在的高科技成功
for technological advancement
Pegasus galaxy has to offer,

271
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:38,516
更别提我们对那里存在的其他生物负有
不可推卸的责任
not to mention our responsibility
to the other humans who live there.

272
00:13:39,267 --> 00:13:40,727
责任？
Responsibility?

273
00:13:40,769 --> 00:13:42,687
是我们唤醒了幽灵
We did wake up the Wraith,

274
00:13:42,729 --> 00:13:46,441
确实，我们要不去的话，这种事情最终仍会发生
and while, yes, that would've happened
eventually without our interference,

275
00:13:46,608 --> 00:13:51,488
可是我们对古老科技的掌握使得我们
有责任保护那里的人
our access to ancient technology puts us in
a unique position to help those people.

276
00:13:51,529 --> 00:13:53,365
我们不能就这样走了
We can't just walk away.

277
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:01,122
我只能向你说你们的建议
Rest assured your recommendation

278
00:14:01,122 --> 00:14:04,000
会被送到政府最高层去研究的
will be given consideration at the highest level.

279
00:14:11,591 --> 00:14:12,967
将军
General, sir!

280
00:14:14,928 --> 00:14:16,012
谢谢
Thank you, sir.

281
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:18,682
Sheppard少校
Major Sheppard.

282
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:25,063
汇报这么快就完了，真令人惊奇啊
I'm surprised the briefing went as quickly as it did.

283
00:14:25,105 --> 00:14:27,065
少校，你很直率
You were very thorough, Major.

284
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,441
谢谢，长官
Thank you, sir.

285
00:14:28,608 --> 00:14:31,528
我想你该好好修养一阵子了
I thought you'd be enjoying some well-deserved R and R.

286
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,531
我正打算要出去待一阵子
I was just going to arrange some transportation, sir.

287
00:14:34,656 --> 00:14:37,117
好好想想去哪儿，少校，哪儿都行
Consider it taken care of, Major. Anywhere you'd like.

288
00:14:37,617 --> 00:14:39,703
啊，你真好
Well, that's very generous.

289
00:14:39,828 --> 00:14:41,705
小伙子，你为国家作出了这么大的贡献
You've done your country a great service, son.

290
00:14:41,746 --> 00:14:43,039
你应得的
You deserve it.

291
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:46,167
谢谢，长官
Thank you, sir.

292
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:01,943
我们的病号怎么样了？
Well, how's our patient doing?

293
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:04,070
少校，我们都检查完了
她可以走了
We're all done, Major.
She's free to go.

294
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:08,617
我还担心你会抛弃我呢
I was afraid you had abandoned me.

295
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:10,327
我正想带你出去呢
Just setting up our ride.

296
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:15,207
这样啊，那我们去哪儿？
So... where are we going?

297
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:20,545
走前要先给你打扮一下
We should start by getting you a new outfit.

298
00:15:56,248 --> 00:15:57,707
你好，Simon
Hello, Simon.

299
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,335
哦，我的上帝
Oh, my god.

300
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:02,254
你什么时候......
When did you...

301
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:15,016
我想你
I missed you.

302
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:33,785
你没有新的留言
You have no new messages.

303
00:16:35,287 --> 00:16:38,206
肯定别人打来的时候停电了
Hmm, must've been a power failure or something.

304
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,583
管他呢......
Anyways...

305
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:50,719
你的电视并没有任何问题
<i>...there is nothing wrong with your television set.</i>

306
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:53,013
请不要调整画面
<i>Do not attempt to adjust the picture.</i>

307
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:55,557
我们控制着电视的直播
<i>We are controlling the transmission...</i>

308
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:59,144
如果我们想它声音大一点的话
我们会加大音量
<i>If we wish to make it louder,</i>
<i>we will bring up the volume.</i>

309
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:02,522
如果我们想它声音变柔和一点的话
我们会......
<i>If we wish to make it softer, we will tune...</i>

310
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:05,817
你好
Hi.

311
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:07,694
你好
Hi.

312
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:13,074
谢谢你，少校
Thank you, Major.

313
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:14,367
不用谢
You're welcome.

314
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:18,038
我光顾过许多不同的世界的超市
I have traded in many market places on many worlds--

315
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,123
是国家，国家.....
Countries. Countries...

316
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:22,751
哦，当然，是国家
yes, of course. Countries...

317
00:17:23,794 --> 00:17:27,172
但是这儿有这么多的东西供选购
But here there are so many
different items to choose from.

318
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,633
似乎你在这儿很开心
Yeah, you seemed like you were having fun,

319
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:33,178
而且一直逛了好几个小时
hours... And hours of fun.

320
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,514
终于挑到一套这么漂亮的衣服
But you picked out a nice outfit.

321
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:37,808
谢谢夸奖
Thank you.

322
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:40,477
我在想......
I wonder...

323
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:42,938
要是我们从未遇到过幽灵的话
If we had never suffered the Wraith,

324
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:47,109
我们还会不会将这种东西视为另一种文明呢
would my people have created
a civilization such as this?

325
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:51,613
我开始对一些事情产生了怀疑了
I'm starting to wonder about a few things myself.

326
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:53,198
你说什么？
What?

327
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,950
你没有任何问题？
Nothing feels wrong to you?

328
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,785
我不是指一件事情
I don't mean one thing.

329
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,871
我的意思是，所有的事情
I mean... everything.

330
00:18:00,122 --> 00:18:01,706
我不明白
I do not understand.

331
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:04,251
对不起，呃
Excuse me, uh...

332
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:07,754
麻烦你带我们去绿苔公园好吗？
Could you take us to the Green Moss park area?

333
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:08,755
没问题
Sure thing.

334
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,673
谢谢
Thank you.

335
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:15,637
我想一旦我们到那儿后就会
搞清楚到底是什么困扰着我们
I think I'll have a better idea of
what's bothering me once we get there.

336
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:21,726
嘿，Sedge
Hey, Sedge!

337
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:23,437
你想我吗？
Did you miss me?

338
00:18:23,562 --> 00:18:24,771
你想我吗？
Did you miss me?

339
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:26,273
想到不能再想了
More than you can imagine.

340
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:40,370
我不知道曾看了多少次你走前留给我的录像带
I don't know how many times
I watched that damn tape you left me.

341
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,373
我早想亲自跟你谈谈
I wanted to tell you in person.

342
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:44,791
不会吧，你不会的
No, you didn't.

343
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:47,711
你担心我会跟你说这事
You were afraid I'd talk you out of it.

344
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:49,963
是的
I was afraid you'd try.

345
00:18:50,422 --> 00:18:51,756
当你告诉我你要走
When you told me you were going away,

346
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:55,051
而且不便告诉我去哪儿的时候
我第一想到的是去韩国
but couldn't say where, my first guess was Korea.

347
00:18:55,427 --> 00:18:57,220
其次想到的是去以色列
My second guess was Israel.

348
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,476
老实说，根本没想过你要去天马星系
To be honest, the Pegasus galaxy didn't make my list.

349
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,270
对不起
I am sorry.

350
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:08,982
我理解
I know.

351
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:14,780
我想你不会告诉我
I imagine my security clearance doesn't let you tell me

352
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:17,199
你们在那儿干些什么吧
what you've been doing while you were there--

353
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:20,535
不会
No.

354
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,537
或者是你们什么时候再次去那儿？
Or when you'll be leaving again?

355
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:23,872
不会
No.

356
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:28,585
哦，不过至少你能向我保证
Well, at the very least, you could promise me that...

357
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:33,632
你会带上这个的
You'll take this with you.

358
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,676
Simon
Simon.

359
00:19:42,474 --> 00:19:43,975
真漂亮啊
It's beautiful.

360
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:54,194
看上去不错
Looks nice.

361
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,613
谢谢
Thank you.

362
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:11,378
怎么了？
Is something wrong?

363
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,675
你知道吗？对不起
刚才你亲我的时候......
You know what? I'm sorry.
It's just when you kissed me...

364
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:20,470
你在说些什么呀，Elizabeth？
What are you talking about, Elizabeth?

365
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:26,768
你好
Hello?

366
00:20:28,145 --> 00:20:29,813
将军，什么——
General. What--

367
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:35,735
好的，我明白了
Yes, I understand.

368
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,320
谢谢
Thank you.

369
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:01,303
等会
Hang on!

370
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:11,396
哦，你好
Oh, hey.

371
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:13,815
刚睡着
Just the middle of a power nap, and...

372
00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:16,193
瞧，裤子还没来得及穿呢
I'm not wearing any pants.

373
00:21:18,612 --> 00:21:20,947
简直不敢相信你知道我住这儿
I didn't even think you knew where I lived.

374
00:21:21,198 --> 00:21:22,157
空军告诉我的
Air Force.

375
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:23,158
这样啊
Oh, right.

376
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,326
哦，你看，我不能......
Oh, look, I can't, um...

377
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:25,452
实际上......
Really, um...

378
00:21:25,494 --> 00:21:27,996
我和302室的姑娘有个约会
I have a date with a girl in 302.

379
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:30,707
她一直养了只猫
She's been taking care of the cat

380
00:21:30,749 --> 00:21:33,835
在我不在的时候
很显然，她很想念我
for the whole time I was away,
and, apparently, she misses me...

381
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:35,921
Rodney
我知道，我会设法将猫赶走的
- Rodney...
- I know, I'm trying to pawn off my cat

382
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:37,839
然后......
off on a neighbor, and I end up with...

383
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:39,090
怎么了？
What?

384
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:41,051
我刚接到Hammond将军打来的电话
I just got a call from General Hammond.

385
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:42,969
普洛米休斯星球出事了
There was an accident on the Prometheus.

386
00:21:44,054 --> 00:21:46,556
我们无法回到亚特兰蒂斯了
We can't go back to Atlantis.

387
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:53,605
我刚回家好好休息了一下
I was going to come home, get some rest,

388
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:55,232
现在精神百倍地回来工作
准备如何解决这个问题
then come back refreshed and
ready to work on a solution,

389
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:58,026
看是一个小时前，我突然明白
就像在浴池中的Archimedes一样
but an hour ago, it hit me,
like Archimedes in the bathtub--

390
00:21:58,068 --> 00:21:59,361
顿悟了！尽管我不在浴池里
Eureka! Except I wasn't in a bathtub.

391
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:02,823
我在沙发上看着我的书
I was on a couch watching
a very strange  outer limits episode...

392
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:04,074
先别提Prometheus
Forget Prometheus.

393
00:22:04,116 --> 00:22:06,701
我已经想出如何搭起一个虫洞了
I've figured out how to
establish a wormhole connection

394
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:09,287
以便回到天马座星系去
可是我需要ZPM
back to the Pegasus galaxy,
but I'm going to need the ZPM.

395
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:12,415
可是ZPM已经用完了，没用了
事实上，不完全这样
- The ZPM has been depleted. It's of no use.
- Actually, that's not entirely true.

396
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:16,169
记得上次我们用的时候，ZPM还留有能量
以使我们能再次回到亚特兰蒂斯
The last time we used it, the ZPM had to establish
and maintain a wormhole back to Atlantis.

397
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:20,340
这次，我们所要做的就是用足够的能量搭起一个
最普通的连接
This time around, all we need for it to do is to have
enough energy to establish the briefest of connections

398
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:23,760
我计算的结果是，整个只需3.5微秒
By my calculations, approximately 3.5 microseconds.

399
00:22:23,885 --> 00:22:27,848
看起来时间还不够啊
将军，记得上次我们去M5S224星球的时候
- That hardly seems like enough time to accomplish--
- General, when we first set foot on M5S224,

400
00:22:27,889 --> 00:22:30,684
在虫洞关闭之前
我检测到能量场的变化
before the wormhole shut down,
I picked up fluctuations in the energy field.

401
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:34,104
假设那是残余能量所引起的话
I just assumed that was an effect of
the gate's residual energy signature,

402
00:22:34,146 --> 00:22:37,107
不过后来我觉得，那些能量不足以引起
能量场这么大的变化
but having given it some thought, I realized
that can't account for such sizable variances,

403
00:22:37,149 --> 00:22:39,151
剩下的只有一个解释
which leaves only one possible explanation.

404
00:22:39,234 --> 00:22:41,278
在我们到达的时候，星际之门一定又被补充了
新的能量
The gate must have been energized on our arrival,

405
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:43,530
也就是说，出去的时候需要能量
meaning it doesn't just draw
power on outgoing wormholes,

406
00:22:43,572 --> 00:22:45,282
返回的时候也需要能量
but on incoming wormholes as well.

407
00:22:45,323 --> 00:22:47,117
我们所要做的只是搭起一个连接
All we have to do is make a connection.

408
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:49,911
3.5微秒，这是搭建
3.5 microseconds, that's
the minimal amount of time it requires

409
00:22:49,995 --> 00:22:52,164
所需的最少时间
to confirm a lock before
the gate automatically kicks in,

410
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:54,749
接着它就会从空气中汲取能量
维持自身的运作了
drawing power from the atmosphere
to maintain the wormhole.

411
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:58,170
请原谅我，博士
你说的这一切听起来很牵强
You'll forgive me, doctor.
This all seems a little farfetched.

412
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:00,672
你可以把它想象成打长途电话那样
Think of it like making a long-distance call

413
00:23:00,755 --> 00:23:02,048
在电话的那一头会有人来接的
to someone you know is going to accept the charges.

414
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,258
你所要做的只是拨一下号而已
All you have to do is dial.

415
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,301
对不起，博士
I'm sorry, doctor.

416
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:06,845
唉，让我试试，你不会遭受任何损失的，对吧？
Well, you're not going to lose
anything by letting me try, are you?

417
00:23:06,887 --> 00:23:08,972
我所要做的只是要实验几次罢了
All I want to do is run a couple of tests.

418
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:14,144
好吧，我会把ZPM送到实验室的
All right. I'll have the ZPM delivered to the lab.

419
00:23:14,811 --> 00:23:15,854
谢谢
Thank you.

420
00:23:34,998 --> 00:23:37,417
Weir博士，没想到你会来这儿
Dr. Weir, I wasn't expecting to see you.

421
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:39,085
我一直在想最近发生的事情
I've been thinking about what happened.

422
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:40,170
谢谢
Thank you.

423
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:44,591
我知道我们是遇到了一些挫折
I know it's a bit of a setback,

424
00:23:44,633 --> 00:23:46,259
但是我不认为我们应就此放弃
but I don't think we should give up just yet.

425
00:23:46,384 --> 00:23:48,220
如果我们能将飞船修好的话
If we can get the prometheus repaired--

426
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:49,846
飞船受到了极大的损坏
The prometheus was severely damaged.

427
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:51,223
我们已失去20个人了
We lost 20 crew members.

428
00:23:51,348 --> 00:23:53,975
她以后再也飞不起来了
She won't be flying again any time soon.

429
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:56,645
我们还可以找仙宫座的来帮忙啊
So we ask the Asgard for one of their ships.

430
00:23:56,728 --> 00:24:01,191
他们要是能帮助的话，肯定会来的
Well, I'm sure that when the Asgard
are in a position to help, they will.

431
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:06,738
将军，我回到地球的原因是我向他们保证过
我肯定会回去的
General, I only came to Earth because
I was assured I'd be able to get back.

432
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:10,367
现在，我不打算放弃我的探险队
Now, I am not about to abandon my expedition team.

433
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:14,704
我会尽最大所能
但是我无法向你保证什么
I'll see what I can do,
but I'm not making any promises.

434
00:24:19,835 --> 00:24:22,337
你得跟别人看看我的情况啊
You've got to talk to somebody about this for me.

435
00:24:22,796 --> 00:24:23,839
对不起了
Look, I'm sorry.

436
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,675
如果这是你收到的命令的话，跟我就没有什么关系了
If those are the orders you received,
it's out of my hands.

437
00:24:26,716 --> 00:24:28,844
我简直不能忍受这份工作，这太无聊了
If there's one thing I can't abide, it's sloppy work.

438
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:30,262
如果你的人好好核实一下实验结果的话
If your people won't double-check their results,

439
00:24:30,345 --> 00:24:32,097
就不会发生这样的事 了
then there's no point in keeping them on the team.

440
00:24:32,139 --> 00:24:33,723
McKay博士
你好，上尉
- Dr. McKay.
- Yes, Lieutenant.

441
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:35,016
我被调职了
I'm being transferred.

442
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,268
恭喜了
Congratulations.

443
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:37,477
不，你不明白
No, you don't understand.

444
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:39,771
我和父母待在一起
还没几天
I was chillin' with my parents,
just having a good time,

445
00:24:39,813 --> 00:24:41,815
就有人要来替换我
and some sergeant shows up with new orders for me.

446
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:42,858
我想回到亚特兰蒂斯
I want to go back to Atlantis,

447
00:24:42,941 --> 00:24:44,401
而他们却想把我送往南极
and they want to ship me back to Antarctica.

448
00:24:44,443 --> 00:24:46,736
上尉，不知你是否知道
Lieutenant, do you know something that I don't,

449
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:49,239
上次我检查的时候
飞船就已收到了严重的损坏
because the last time I checked,
the Prometheus was critically damaged,

450
00:24:49,281 --> 00:24:52,284
我们所拥有的在ZPM连一台
汽车音响都开不了
and the only ZPM in our possession
didn't have the power to run a car stereo.

451
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:54,327
我想你会找到别的方法的
I just thought you'd be trying to find another way.

452
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:55,829
上尉，没有别的方法
There is no other way, Lieutenant.

453
00:24:55,871 --> 00:24:57,539
你得准备好面对现实吧
You're just going to have to deal with it.

454
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:27,444
谢谢
Thank you.

455
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:36,077
待在这儿难道不好吗？
Would it be so bad if you had to stay?

456
00:25:37,746 --> 00:25:39,247
对不起，Simon
I'm sorry, Simon.

457
00:25:39,498 --> 00:25:41,583
我知道这对你很不公平
I know none of this is fair to you.

458
00:25:42,626 --> 00:25:45,921
我知道我很难与人类史上最伟大
的发现相提并论
It is tough to compete with
the greatest adventure in human history.

459
00:25:49,341 --> 00:25:51,009
我并不怪你离开
I don't blame you for going.

460
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,930
谢谢
Thank you...

461
00:25:56,765 --> 00:25:58,433
可是我仍然感到内疚
But I still feel guilty.

462
00:25:59,226 --> 00:26:01,686
现在我对回来感到内疚了
And now I feel guilty about being back.

463
00:26:02,854 --> 00:26:04,731
因为那些你留在那儿的人
Because of the people you left behind?

464
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:08,026
不是，我应该留在亚特兰蒂斯的
No. I should have stayed at Atlantis.

465
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:11,613
应该只让Sheppard少校一个人回来
Major Sheppard should have been the one to go.

466
00:26:18,495 --> 00:26:20,038
哦，天
Oh, yeah.

467
00:26:21,289 --> 00:26:22,707
和我走的时候一样
Just like I left it.

468
00:26:24,626 --> 00:26:28,463
一个人住这么大地方太空了点
So much space for just one person.

469
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:32,592
呃，男孩子吗，就得这样啊
Well, a guy's got to have a lot of space.

470
00:26:37,013 --> 00:26:39,182
我想应该还有点......
I bet there's still...

471
00:26:44,354 --> 00:26:45,564
太好了
Perfect.

472
00:26:55,782 --> 00:26:57,200
这个不错，冰的
Nice and cold.

473
00:26:57,576 --> 00:26:59,202
这是
And this is...

474
00:26:59,286 --> 00:27:00,954
这叫啤酒
It's called beer.

475
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:13,675
这些都是用来
Is all this...

476
00:27:14,134 --> 00:27:15,802
娱乐的吗？
For recreation?

477
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:20,432
是啊，很多你意想不到的东西我这儿都有，对吧？
Yeah, I got pretty much everything
you can imagine, don't I?

478
00:27:26,188 --> 00:27:27,439
怎么了？
What is it?

479
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:31,485
我又在想了......
I was just thinking again...

480
00:27:32,277 --> 00:27:36,823
Weir博士和其他人在亚特兰蒂斯的情况
How Dr. Weir and everyone else on Atlantis...

481
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:38,700
当然
Of course.

482
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:41,328
我敢肯定她没事的
I am sure she is fine.

483
00:27:43,205 --> 00:27:45,916
而且他们所有的人都没事的
As I am sure they are all fine.

484
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:49,044
是啊
Yeah.

485
00:27:49,628 --> 00:27:50,879
我也这么想
I'm sure.

486
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:05,102
你们还没有得出实验结果吗？
You people have those test results for me yet?

487
00:28:05,685 --> 00:28:06,895
还需要一点时间
We need more time.

488
00:28:06,978 --> 00:28:08,897
你说什么？让我看看你们得出些什么结论
What are you talking about?
Let me see what you've got.

489
00:28:11,608 --> 00:28:12,776
等等
Wait a minute.

490
00:28:12,943 --> 00:28:14,611
这是什么，你开玩笑吗？
What is this, some kind of a joke?

491
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,822
我跟你说了，还需要点时间
I told you, we need more time.

492
00:28:16,863 --> 00:28:18,740
这些根本没用
These don't even make any sense.

493
00:28:20,742 --> 00:28:23,578
我们认为ZPM已经没有足够的能量来
开启虫洞了
We don't think the ZPM has enough
power to open the wormhole.

494
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,122
可是，你难道不知道你写了些什么吗？
Well, you wouldn't know that from this, would you?

495
00:28:25,163 --> 00:28:26,706
一堆乱七八糟的东西
This might as well say, "bing, tiddle, tiddle, bong."

496
00:28:26,748 --> 00:28:28,250
都是垃圾
It's complete gibberish.

497
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:30,085
你给我出去，我来做
Look, get out of here. I'll do it.

498
00:28:30,961 --> 00:28:32,003
滚
Go.

499
00:28:34,631 --> 00:28:36,299
你简直就是在搞笑
You've got to be kidding me.

500
00:28:38,426 --> 00:28:40,429
博士，感谢你又回来了
Thank you for coming in again, Doctor.

501
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,597
我的要求有没有回应？
Has there been a response to my request?

502
00:28:43,265 --> 00:28:46,351
事实上，我们不打算从仙宫座活得任何帮助
Actually, we won't be needing any help from the Asgard.

503
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:49,604
McKay博士似乎已经找到一个解决方法了
It turns out Dr. McKay has found a solution

504
00:28:49,729 --> 00:28:52,691
可以重新开启虫洞，让我们回到天马座
that will enable us to open a wormhole back to Pegasus.

505
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:53,900
他已经？
He has?

506
00:28:54,317 --> 00:28:56,194
为什么我还不知道？
Why wasn't I informed?

507
00:28:57,612 --> 00:29:01,366
博士，亚特兰蒂斯的探险任务被重新评估了
Doctor, the Atlantis mission has been reassessed.

508
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:03,660
什么意思？
What does that mean?

509
00:29:04,703 --> 00:29:07,706
就你们带回的有关幽灵的信息来看
In light of the intelligence you
brought us concerning the Wraith,

510
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:12,043
我们一致认为亚特兰蒂斯星球上的生物应该是
极具侵略性的东西
it's been decided that the Atlantis
presence should be military.

511
00:29:13,253 --> 00:29:15,213
我们的盟友也这么认为吗?
Our allies have agreed to this?

512
00:29:15,255 --> 00:29:16,381
是的
They did.

513
00:29:16,506 --> 00:29:19,217
一旦Mckay博士重新搭起虫洞
As soon as Dr. McKay can establish a wormhole,

514
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:21,636
我们打算派支部队过去
we intend to send reinforcements,

515
00:29:21,678 --> 00:29:24,431
同时还要再指派一名指挥官一同前往
along with a new commanding officer.

516
00:29:25,182 --> 00:29:28,769
博士，真对不起，你已经被解职了
I'm sorry, doctor, but you've
been relieved of your duties.

517
00:29:28,894 --> 00:29:30,145
唉，等会
Okay, wait a minute.

518
00:29:30,562 --> 00:29:33,982
我并没有说那里有外星人的军事武装
I am not saying that there shouldn't
be an increased military presence,

519
00:29:34,107 --> 00:29:36,443
可是原来的任务还是要继续进行下去的
but the mission must remain the same...

520
00:29:36,777 --> 00:29:39,070
我肯定Sheppard少校若是听到你刚才说的话
他会告诉你......
And I'm sure if Major Sheppard
were here he'd tell you--

521
00:29:39,112 --> 00:29:40,530
我们已经和Sheppard少校沟通过了
We've spoken to Major Sheppard.

522
00:29:40,572 --> 00:29:43,575
他一小时前刚打电话过来
想看看你进展如何
He dialed in about an hour ago
to check on your progress.

523
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:45,577
我们将当前形式跟他说了
We informed him of the situation,

524
00:29:45,619 --> 00:29:47,621
他也同意我们的判断
and he agrees with our assessment.

525
00:29:48,246 --> 00:29:50,332
他不会这么做的，将军
He wouldn't do that, General.

526
00:29:50,499 --> 00:29:52,042
我很了解John Sheppard
I know John Sheppard.

527
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:55,212
很显然，你并不想你所想象的那样了解他，博士
Apparently, you don't know him
as well as you thought, Doctor.

528
00:29:55,295 --> 00:29:57,380
Sheppard 少校坚决同意
Major Sheppard stated categorically

529
00:29:57,464 --> 00:30:00,634
这是确保任务安全完成的唯一方法
it's the only way to ensure
the security of the project.

530
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:05,388
我们出去吧
Let's get out of here.

531
00:30:05,514 --> 00:30:06,515
为什么？
Why?

532
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,642
你想看看地面是吧，就在那儿
You want to see Earth, right? It's out there.

533
00:30:08,892 --> 00:30:13,730
我想你该在家住段时间，看看老朋友
I thought you would want to spend
time in your home, visit with friends.

534
00:30:14,106 --> 00:30:16,149
好主意
There is an idea.

535
00:30:19,027 --> 00:30:20,112
嘿
Hey!

536
00:30:22,364 --> 00:30:23,406
Mitch
Mitch.

537
00:30:24,699 --> 00:30:25,700
Dex
Dex.

538
00:30:25,867 --> 00:30:29,579
你真的认为你在这个城市走一圈
我们会看不到你吗
You didn't really think you could pass
through town without seeing us, did you, Shep?

539
00:30:30,747 --> 00:30:32,582
你想不想让我们进来啊？
So you going to invite us in or what?

540
00:30:33,708 --> 00:30:36,253
哦，当然了，这到底怎么了？
Yeah, sure. What the hell?

541
00:30:38,046 --> 00:30:39,214
你好，我是Dex
Hi. I'm Dex.

542
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,606
这是什么？
What is this?

543
00:30:57,274 --> 00:30:58,650
有没有什么问题？
Is there a problem?

544
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:00,485
Elizabeth
Elizabeth.

545
00:31:00,986 --> 00:31:02,779
Rodney，我得和你谈谈
能等会吗？
- Rodney, I need to talk to you.
- Can it wait?

546
00:31:02,821 --> 00:31:05,532
不行，这里始终不对劲
No. Something is very wrong here.

547
00:31:06,032 --> 00:31:07,492
我在检测ZPM
I've run a diagnostic on the ZPM.

548
00:31:07,534 --> 00:31:09,411
这些是我得来的实验结果
These are the results I keep getting back.

549
00:31:10,662 --> 00:31:12,497
Rodney，我不是科学家
I'm not a scientist, Rodney.

550
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:16,918
没人是科学家，或者说在这儿
物理学的各种法则，定律都他妈的失效了
Neither is anyone else, or they'd have noticed
the laws of physics seem to have flown out the window.

551
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,879
也许是你的设备出了问题吧
Maybe there's a problem with your equipment.

552
00:31:19,421 --> 00:31:20,839
我检查过，没问题的
I checked. It's fine.

553
00:31:20,964 --> 00:31:24,468
这样的话，要是你没能得出正确的结果的话
那便是你的错了
Look, if your solution doesn't work,
it's not your fault.

554
00:31:25,343 --> 00:31:28,638
我们只得接受我们无法回去的事实了
We'll just have to accept
the fact that we can't go back.

555
00:31:29,181 --> 00:31:30,974
什么？
What?

556
00:31:36,855 --> 00:31:38,565
我们的人被敌人火力压住了
So our boys were pinned down.

557
00:31:38,607 --> 00:31:42,277
我们最终设法通过了那座桥
So hotshot takes his chopper over this bridge--

558
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,612
我们还想跟在他后面呢
And we were supposed to follow him.

559
00:31:43,653 --> 00:31:47,616
可那是不可能的，我当时正骑着一只鹰
在敌人的坦克上面飞呢
Well, there's no way I'm flying a blackhawk
over a bridge with enemy tanks on it--

560
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:48,825
等等，你说什么来着？
Wait, with what on it?

561
00:31:48,867 --> 00:31:50,494
坦克
哦，是吗
- Tanks.
- You're welcome.

562
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,499
你这家伙还真有趣
I still love that, man.

563
00:31:58,418 --> 00:32:01,546
是啊，他真幽默啊
Yeah, that was, uh... priceless.

564
00:32:01,588 --> 00:32:02,798
可是......
But, uh...

565
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:06,301
我们最终得让队伍通过那里，对吧，Shep？
We got that special ops team
out of there, didn't we, Shep?

566
00:32:06,343 --> 00:32:07,719
是的
Yes, we did.

567
00:32:08,053 --> 00:32:10,097
我跟你说吧，除非我们都长翅膀才行
I'll tell you what, that was some flying, Shep.

568
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:19,064
快看，这是谁送比萨来了
Well, look who's in the pizza-delivery business.

569
00:32:19,106 --> 00:32:19,940
先生
No, sir.

570
00:32:20,065 --> 00:32:21,525
我只是在送货的途中得知你回来了
I just caught the guy on the way up.

571
00:32:22,067 --> 00:32:24,611
我刚想到你
干嘛不过来坐坐？
I was just thinking about you.
Why don't you come in?

572
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:27,030
看起来我们正......
Looks like we...

573
00:32:27,364 --> 00:32:29,699
开着晚会
Are having a party.

574
00:32:30,033 --> 00:32:31,409
谢谢
Thanks.

575
00:32:31,993 --> 00:32:33,453
我的比萨
I've got pizza.

576
00:32:37,916 --> 00:32:40,127
我被解职了
I've been relieved of my command.

577
00:32:40,252 --> 00:32:42,212
哦，很抱歉听到你这个消息
Oh. Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

578
00:32:42,337 --> 00:32:44,881
他们要派军队去亚特兰蒂斯
They're going to militarize Atlantis.

579
00:32:45,757 --> 00:32:47,134
真有趣
Interesting.

580
00:32:47,259 --> 00:32:48,927
不过这迟早会发生的
Well, it was bound to happen sooner or later.

581
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:51,179
什么，你也认同他们的作法？
What, so you're just okay with this?

582
00:32:51,471 --> 00:32:54,433
Elizabrth，你一直对他们说什么鬼魂的事情
你想他们会怎么做？
Elizabeth, how did you expect them to react
when you told them about the Wraith?

583
00:32:54,474 --> 00:32:56,893
可是至少他们得让我参加啊
At the very least, I thought I'd be kept in the loop.

584
00:32:56,935 --> 00:33:00,105
你看来有些神经质了，干嘛不回家
和Simon好好待在一起在在？
You're just being paranoid.
Go spend time with Simon.

585
00:33:00,147 --> 00:33:00,939
Simon？
Simon?

586
00:33:00,981 --> 00:33:02,482
是啊，他对你难道不重要吗？
Yes, he's important to you, isn't he?

587
00:33:03,733 --> 00:33:04,651
当然
Yes.

588
00:33:05,986 --> 00:33:08,113
我真的不记得曾跟你讲过他的事情
I just don't remember ever telling you that.

589
00:33:10,991 --> 00:33:12,993
哦，我怎么知道的呢？
Well, how else would I have known?

590
00:33:15,912 --> 00:33:17,247
我们不知道该想些什么？
We didn't know what to think.

591
00:33:17,998 --> 00:33:19,458
我的意思是，这些家伙
I mean, this guy was supposedly

592
00:33:19,624 --> 00:33:22,544
可能是阿富汗最残忍的人
one of the most ruthless warlords in afghanistan,

593
00:33:22,586 --> 00:33:24,504
可能突然间他们还会做到我们的饭桌前
and suddenly, he just sits down at our table.

594
00:33:24,629 --> 00:33:25,839
老兄，你得听听这个故事
Sir, you got to hear this story--

595
00:33:25,881 --> 00:33:27,132
中尉，当时我在场
Yeah, I was there, Lieutenant...

596
00:33:27,174 --> 00:33:28,467
哦，是吗，你记得了
Oh, yeah, you remember.

597
00:33:28,633 --> 00:33:31,428
看起来他是想好好锻炼一下自己的英语啊
Turns out he just wants to practice his english.

598
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:33,972
Shep花了半夜和这个家伙聊天
Shep spent half the night talking to this guy.

599
00:33:34,139 --> 00:33:35,432
真有趣
That was funny.

600
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,351
他甚至不会让你得闲上厕所，还记得吗？
He wouldn't even let you get up
to go to the bathroom, remember?

601
00:33:42,564 --> 00:33:48,195
两天后，你们在Kabul就战死了
And two days later, you guys were killed outside Kabul.

602
00:33:51,656 --> 00:33:53,617
让我看看是否能让你明白，好吗？
Let me see if I can make you understand, okay?

603
00:33:53,658 --> 00:33:55,285
这些结果不仅仅证明了ZPM无法运作了
These results don't just say the ZPM won't work.

604
00:33:55,327 --> 00:33:57,621
而且还证明所有的自然定律都不起作用了
They say this reality isn't
governed by any natural laws.

605
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:01,666
就像通过一个显微镜去观察一个细胞
却发现在细胞中有成千上万只老鼠在跳舞
It's like looking through a microscope at a cell
culture and seeing a thousand dancing hamsters!

606
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:02,876
这是不可能的
it's impossible!

607
00:34:02,918 --> 00:34:04,127
Rodney，你得安静下来
Rodney, you need to calm down.

608
00:34:04,169 --> 00:34:06,171
不不不，我心里现在简直烦透了
No, no, what I need to do now is get very agitated,

609
00:34:06,213 --> 00:34:08,048
因为我意识到这所有的一切都是假的
because what I'm realizing
is that all of this is a lie.

610
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,508
这个，这个
This... And this...

611
00:34:10,425 --> 00:34:11,468
还有这个
And this!

612
00:34:16,264 --> 00:34:17,474
你说什么？
What are you saying?

613
00:34:17,849 --> 00:34:20,769
直升机当时去救你们的时候出事了
Their chopper took an RPG when
it touched down for a medevac.

614
00:34:21,895 --> 00:34:25,565
你们不可能存活下来
There was barely enough left
to bring back for a military funeral.

615
00:34:25,732 --> 00:34:26,733
你说什么？
What?

616
00:34:26,858 --> 00:34:28,944
你们已经死去很多年了
You guys have been dead for years.

617
00:34:29,861 --> 00:34:33,532
真的很高兴能在见到你们
Don't get me wrong, it's really nice seeing you...

618
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:35,408
还有你，Wstson夫人
And you too, Mrs. Watson.

619
00:34:35,575 --> 00:34:38,036
先生，我不知道
她是我六年级时的老师
- Sir, I don't...
- She was my sixth grade teacher...

620
00:34:38,078 --> 00:34:39,204
还有
And...

621
00:34:39,246 --> 00:34:43,208
我不记得你叫什么
但是我相信我们以前从未在一起过
I don't even remember your name,
but I remember you wouldn't even date me!

622
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:45,794
Shep，我想我们得带你去看看医生
Shep, I think we should take you to see a doctor.

623
00:34:46,002 --> 00:34:47,087
哦，是吗？
Oh, really?

624
00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:49,297
哦，你的行为真是有点怪
Yeah, you're acting pretty strange.

625
00:34:51,508 --> 00:34:53,593
我的行为有点怪，嗯？
Oh, I'm acting strange, huh?

626
00:35:02,352 --> 00:35:03,270
少尉！
Major!

627
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,987
现在，你知道我指的是什么了吧？
Now, do you see what I mean?

628
00:35:13,029 --> 00:35:16,032
我所认识的Rodney McKay决不会无条件同意
Okay, the Rodney McKay I know would never accept

629
00:35:16,158 --> 00:35:19,327
派部队去亚特兰蒂斯的
the militarization of Atlantis
without putting up a fight.

630
00:35:19,536 --> 00:35:21,830
我相信Sheppard少校也决不会同意这么做的
I don't think Major Sheppard would agree to it either.

631
00:35:21,913 --> 00:35:24,166
至少在跟我提过此事之前不会这么做的
At least not without speaking to me about it first.

632
00:35:24,249 --> 00:35:26,168
Elizabeth，你也别太认真了好不好
Elizabeth, you shouldn't take it personally.

633
00:35:26,209 --> 00:35:27,669
我的意思是，把它想象成一件好事
I mean, think of it like a blessing.

634
00:35:27,711 --> 00:35:30,088
你有自己的生活
你现在无法回去了
You have a life.
You can get back to it now.

635
00:35:31,339 --> 00:35:33,758
不，我不会就这么算了的
No. I'm not buying this anymore.

636
00:35:33,884 --> 00:35:35,510
你究竟是谁？
Who are you really?

637
00:35:36,261 --> 00:35:37,679
我是谁？你什么意思？
Who am I? What do you mean?

638
00:35:39,931 --> 00:35:41,308
你开枪打我！
You shot me!

639
00:35:41,433 --> 00:35:42,601
你已经死了
You're already dead.

640
00:35:42,642 --> 00:35:44,269
先生，请把枪给我
Sir, give me the...

641
00:35:45,312 --> 00:35:47,564
中尉，现在我对你也开始怀疑你了
I'm beginning to have my doubts
about you too, Lieutenant.

642
00:35:47,689 --> 00:35:49,608
我不会想当然就当然了
I wouldn't put them to a test.

643
00:35:56,406 --> 00:36:02,078
现在，你们赶紧告诉我这儿到底
他妈的是怎么回事？
Now, somebody explain to me
what the hell is going on here.

644
00:36:05,165 --> 00:36:06,500
Wire博士
Dr. Weir.

645
00:36:10,128 --> 00:36:11,713
好了，别在撒谎了
Okay, no more lies.

646
00:36:11,755 --> 00:36:13,673
这究竟是怎么回事？
What is this?
What's happening to me?

647
00:36:14,257 --> 00:36:16,968
没有必要在骗你了
There's no point in deluding you any longer.

648
00:36:24,142 --> 00:36:25,602
现在你知道了
Now you know.

649
00:36:38,357 --> 00:36:39,525
Rodney到哪儿去了
Where's Rodney?

650
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:41,736
真正的McKay博士和他的队员们都
The real Dr. McKay and the rest of his team

651
00:36:41,819 --> 00:36:44,363
生活在各自的幻想世界里
reside in their own illusory worlds.

652
00:36:45,489 --> 00:36:47,700
我想见他们，请带我去
I want to see them. Please.

653
00:36:58,919 --> 00:37:00,504
怎么了？
What happened?

654
00:37:01,464 --> 00:37:04,133
我把你们各自从幻想世界带回来了
I drew you together from your fractured realities.

655
00:37:04,175 --> 00:37:06,135
刚才我手里还拿着啤酒呢
No, I'm talking about the beer I had.

656
00:37:06,177 --> 00:37:08,679
Sheppard少校刚才也发现了事实的真相
Major Sheppard discovered the truth some time ago.

657
00:37:09,221 --> 00:37:10,139
是吗？
He did?

658
00:37:10,181 --> 00:37:13,976
在过去的11个月中，我在在南极做个项目呢
Home for the last 11 months,
has been a research base in Antarctica.

659
00:37:14,352 --> 00:37:18,272
尽管我以前真的曾这么想过，可是......
although... I did dream about
a bachelor pad like that, but--

660
00:37:18,314 --> 00:37:20,358
Sheppard少校似乎有着独特的能力来操控
Major Sheppard seemed uniquely capable

661
00:37:20,483 --> 00:37:23,152
想象的世界
of manipulating his own fabricated reality.

662
00:37:23,277 --> 00:37:25,821
一想到我这些假想的经历，真想狠狠地踢自己一脚
When I think of the scenarios
I could've thought up, I'd kick myself.

663
00:37:25,946 --> 00:37:29,408
你们所经历的这些经历是你们脑海
中曾经出现过的思维的片断
The realities you experienced were
fabrications of your own minds.

664
00:37:29,617 --> 00:37:32,328
因为你尚无地球上生活的经历
Since you had no memories of Earth to draw from,

665
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:34,789
所以你便加入了Shepard少校的幻想之中
you shared in Major Sheppard's illusion.

666
00:37:36,666 --> 00:37:38,084
我想那肯定是你
I thought that was you.

667
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:41,504
真遗憾你们这么快就苏醒过来了
It is unfortunate that you all became aware so quickly.

668
00:37:41,671 --> 00:37:44,048
不过，你们仍可以选择一个幻想的场景
Hower, you may now create a fabricated reality

669
00:37:44,173 --> 00:37:48,260
以便度过余生
of your own choosing in which to live
out the remainder of your lives.

670
00:37:48,427 --> 00:37:49,512
你说什么？
What?

671
00:37:49,595 --> 00:37:51,222
那对我们没用的
That's not going to work for us.

672
00:37:51,347 --> 00:37:53,557
恐怕这件事由不得你来控制
I'm afraid the matter is beyond your control.

673
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,228
那好
Well...

674
00:37:57,979 --> 00:37:59,563
我们会想出办法来打倒你
We'll find a way to fight you.

675
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:01,482
那简直就是不可能的，少校
That would be quite impossible, Major.

676
00:38:01,607 --> 00:38:05,403
即使你们处于同一个幻境之中
Even now you are simply
experiencing a shared fabrication.

677
00:38:05,903 --> 00:38:09,156
你们最好各自过各自的生活
It will be best if you try
to make a life for yourselves.

678
00:38:09,198 --> 00:38:10,574
这根本不是什么生活！
This isn't life!

679
00:38:11,242 --> 00:38:13,077
你想让我们怎么办，要装一辈子傻子？
What do you want us to do, just pretend?

680
00:38:13,327 --> 00:38:15,621
对不起，我能做到的就这些了
I'm sorry, but that's all I can offer you.

681
00:38:15,913 --> 00:38:17,289
你等会
Wait.

682
00:38:18,791 --> 00:38:20,376
为什么你要这么做？
Why would you do this?

683
00:38:20,418 --> 00:38:22,044
为了保护我们自己
To protect ourselves.

684
00:38:22,795 --> 00:38:24,046
防备我们？
From us?

685
00:38:25,756 --> 00:38:27,633
我们不想伤害任何人
We did not intend to harm anyone.

686
00:38:27,842 --> 00:38:31,053
不像你们，我们是以一种能量的，无形的形式存在
Unlike you, we exist in a
non-corporeal form susceptible

687
00:38:31,178 --> 00:38:34,724
于这个星球上，我们不能受到任何毁灭性的影响
to the destructive effects
of the Stargate on our home-world.

688
00:38:35,224 --> 00:38:36,809
什么毁灭性的影响？
What destructive effects?

689
00:38:36,976 --> 00:38:39,353
这就是为什么能量表显示，这里有
生命的迹象
So the energy readings, they were life signs.

690
00:38:39,395 --> 00:38:40,438
你活在雾中
You were in the mist.

691
00:38:40,563 --> 00:38:44,442
我们就是雾，每次星际之门打开的时候
我们中就会有很多人死去
We are the mist, and every time
the gate is activated, lives are lost.

692
00:38:45,318 --> 00:38:50,114
很多次，探险者们来了又走
根本无视我们的存在
Over time, explorers have come and gone,
completely unaware of our existence.

693
00:38:50,156 --> 00:38:53,284
为了安全起见，我们必须付出牺牲
Sacrifices are made to ensure our secrecy,

694
00:38:53,451 --> 00:38:56,162
你们一来便引起了我们的警惕
but when you came back, we grew concerned.

695
00:38:56,329 --> 00:39:00,082
为了得知你们的想法，我们除了进入你们的
大脑之外别无选择
To learn your intentions,
we had no choice but to enter your minds.

696
00:39:00,166 --> 00:39:02,251
当我们得知你们要做什么的时候
When we discovered what you were about to do,

697
00:39:02,376 --> 00:39:04,962
我们被迫采取防护措施
we were forced to take preventive measures.

698
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:07,923
但是你刚才说让别人来了又走
But you just said you'd let others come and go.

699
00:39:08,716 --> 00:39:10,635
为什么不让我们也这样做呢？
Why not allow us to do the same?

700
00:39:10,801 --> 00:39:13,929
你们回家的想法太强烈了
Your desire to return to
your home-world was too strong.

701
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:16,849
要搭建通往其他星系的大门所需的能量
The amount of energy required to gate to another galaxy

702
00:39:16,974 --> 00:39:19,518
将会使数以百万计的生灵丧命
would have killed millions of our kind.

703
00:39:23,439 --> 00:39:25,858
所以当我们试图打开大门的时候——
So when we dialed the gate--

704
00:39:25,983 --> 00:39:29,111
你们从未打开大门
你们只是假想你们打开了
You never dialed the gate.
You just imagined you did.

705
00:39:29,904 --> 00:39:33,366
即使现在，你们仍在这个星球的表面上躺着
不省人事
You are unconscious, even now, on the planet's surface.

706
00:39:33,908 --> 00:39:35,451
那么，刚才发生的一切都是假的了？
So none of this is real?

707
00:39:37,995 --> 00:39:40,706
那个漂亮的黑色肤色的女人
我本该知道的，怎么能够从......
The cute brunette. Of course, I should've known.
I mean, how do you go from...

708
00:39:40,748 --> 00:39:44,043
“你是头猪，可是我喜欢你的猫”一直聊到
“我很想你”
"you're a pig, but I like your cat" to "I missed you"?

709
00:39:44,835 --> 00:39:47,922
我们没有你们的思维那么复杂
We lacked a sophisticated understanding of your world.

710
00:39:48,089 --> 00:39:52,802
所以，我们为你们创造的幻境
还是有所缺陷的
As a result, the illusions we created
from your thoughts were ultimately flawed.

711
00:39:52,927 --> 00:39:55,846
死人就不会制造麻烦了
The dead people were a dead giveaway.

712
00:39:56,597 --> 00:39:57,807
死人
Dead people.

713
00:39:57,974 --> 00:39:59,058
你说什么?
What were you doing?

714
00:39:59,308 --> 00:40:01,852
如果你提早告诉我们，我的意思是，也许我们可以......
哦，等等
- If you had just told us, I mean, maybe we could...
- Whoa, wait.

715
00:40:01,894 --> 00:40:03,062
我想起什么了
I just realized something.

716
00:40:03,145 --> 00:40:05,731
你刚才说我们那不省人事的身躯
还在这个星球的表面上
You're saying that our unconscious
bodies are still on the planet.

717
00:40:05,773 --> 00:40:06,482
是的
Yes.

718
00:40:06,524 --> 00:40:09,568
可是，我们需要食物，我们需要水
我的意思是，我们需要事物
Yeah, well, so we need food. We need water.
I mean, we need food.

719
00:40:09,902 --> 00:40:12,279
他的意思是要让我们处于这种状态下
便会活不长久
What he's saying is we won't live long in this state.

720
00:40:12,321 --> 00:40:14,865
所以我建议你们要好好利用剩下来的时间啊
Then I suggest you make the most
of the time you have left.

721
00:40:15,741 --> 00:40:18,160
为了就你自己却要杀了我们
You're killing us in order to save yourselves.

722
00:40:18,327 --> 00:40:20,997
是为了拯救数百万个我们同类
In order to save millions of our kind.

723
00:40:21,122 --> 00:40:22,915
相信你要是我的话也会这么做的
I believe you would do the same.

724
00:40:23,165 --> 00:40:26,585
如果我们没回去的话
我们的朋友会来找我们的
If we do not go back,
our friends will come looking for us.

725
00:40:26,711 --> 00:40:27,878
你们其他人？
Others of your kind?

726
00:40:28,129 --> 00:40:29,588
他们会出现的
They'll show up.

727
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,757
你打算怎么做，也杀了他们?
What are you going to do, kill them too?

728
00:40:33,301 --> 00:40:34,552
还回来更多的
And more will come.

729
00:40:34,593 --> 00:40:37,054
总有一天，他们会知道怎么进入
这个星际之门
One day, they'll figure out how to access the Gate.

730
00:40:37,096 --> 00:40:39,807
到时，数百万的你们同类仍然会死的
Then millions of your kind will die.

731
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,896
我们从不会落下战友的
We don't leave people behind,

732
00:40:46,314 --> 00:40:49,567
要是你是真的Hammond将军的话
你早就知道这一点了
and if you were really General Hammond,
you'd know that.

733
00:40:53,112 --> 00:40:55,197
但是如果你允许我们离开这里
But if you allow us to leave here,

734
00:40:55,781 --> 00:40:58,659
我们保证我们永远都不会再来这儿的
永远不会
we promise we will never return, ever.

735
00:40:59,618 --> 00:41:03,998
你将不必害怕我们
我向你保证
You will not have to fear us ever again.
I give you my word.

736
00:41:05,541 --> 00:41:09,295
你现在一心想着回家，当然会这么说了
How can you make such a promise
when you so desire to return home?

737
00:41:10,004 --> 00:41:11,047
确实
Sure,

738
00:41:11,464 --> 00:41:13,090
我们是想回家
we'd like to go home.

739
00:41:13,174 --> 00:41:16,260
可是我们并不想为此目的
去杀死数百万你们同类
We're not willing to kill
millions of your kind to do it.

740
00:41:17,803 --> 00:41:21,098
你已经在我们的大脑中了
现在已经在我们的大脑中了
You've been in our heads.
You're in our heads right now

741
00:41:21,265 --> 00:41:23,434
你应该知道我们是认真的
You should know we mean that.

742
00:41:36,155 --> 00:41:38,199
我明白
I understand.

743
00:42:05,893 --> 00:42:09,563
我并不想发表相反的意见
因为这可能有点......你知道
I don't mean to sound negative,
because that would be, you know, so not me...

744
00:42:09,605 --> 00:42:12,358
你怎么知道这不是个骗局呢？
But how do we know this isn't a double fake-out?

745
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,609
我的意思是，我们怎么知道这是不是真的
I mean, how do we know that this is--

746
00:42:13,651 --> 00:42:15,319
这是你们的真实世界
This is your reality.

747
00:42:15,569 --> 00:42:17,446
我向你们保证
You have my word.

748
00:42:21,033 --> 00:42:22,284
我饿了
I'm starving.

749
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:23,869
他说的对
He's got to be right.

750
00:42:23,995 --> 00:42:25,538
我在想我们出来多久了
I wonder how long we've been out.

751
00:42:26,288 --> 00:42:29,291
我得水晶球从DHD中取出来
几分钟就可以了
I need to get the control crystal out of the DHD.
Shouldn't take more than a few minutes.

752
00:42:30,251 --> 00:42:31,711
我帮你一把
I'll give you a hand.

753
00:42:34,338 --> 00:42:37,216
谢谢你相信我们
Thank you for trusting us.

754
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:41,262
Rodney，小心点
Rodney, be careful with that.

755
00:42:42,221 --> 00:42:44,140
我要确保我们能回到家
I want to make sure we can get back home.

756
00:42:44,265 --> 00:42:45,516
你指的是亚特兰蒂斯？
You mean Atlantis?

757
00:42:46,017 --> 00:42:47,518
我想她就是这么想的
I think that's what she meant.

758
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:50,938
我怎么知道她不想让我玩个花招
让我连通去地球的通道
How do I know she wasn't suggesting
we pull a double fake and dial Earth?

759
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:52,148
别玩花招了
Forget the double fake.

760
00:42:52,189 --> 00:42:53,399
快把那该死的水晶球拿出来
Get the damn crystal.

761
00:42:53,441 --> 00:42:54,900
我会这么做的


I'll do the dial-out.
