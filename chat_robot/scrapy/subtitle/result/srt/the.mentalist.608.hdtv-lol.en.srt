1
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:04,330
Previously on "The Mentalist"...

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:10,230
Ten years ago,the serial killer known
as Red John killed my wife and daughter.

3
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,660
We've been hunting for him ever since.

4
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:18,970
We call ourselves the Blake association.

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,060
Well,who else is in the association?

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,980
Cops,judges,F.B.I.
agents--

7
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:25,860
anyone in law enforcement
that needs a secret covered up.

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,580
A secret society of dirty cops.

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,560
And Red John's a member.

10
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:33,850
Kira Tinsley told me
something before she passed.

11
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,460
She told me that her
killer-- Red John--

12
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,120
has a tattoo-- three
dots on his left arm.

13
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:42,470
So who's Red John?

14
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,520
Today we're pleased to announce that
we--we finally have a name,a face.

15
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:52,840
The director of the division of law
enforcement,Gail Bertram,is Red John.

16
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:58,050
I am holding in my hand a
writ from a federal judge.

17
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:01,800
The F.B.I. is closing down
your organization right now.

18
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,280
We're done.There's
nothing more to do here.

19
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,970
You're not quitting.I don't believe it.

20
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,040
It's out of our hands for now.

21
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,430
I'll be in touch.Okay?

22
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,820
I'm sorry. For everything.

23
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,320
Lisbon.Glad you can join us.

24
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,090
Traffic.

25
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,450
Where's Jane?

26
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,850
He'll be in to see you
as soon as he's able.

27
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,710
This way.

28
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,850
Please,take a seat.

29
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,600
Boy,this is a mess,huh?

30
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:19,370
A big mess.

31
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,110
- Look,I think we all--
you can talk later.

32
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,910
Now I understand... You
must all feel scared,nervous.

33
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:33,390
Don't know what in the hell
is gonna happen next,right?

34
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:36,680
- Agent-- So let me
explain what's next.

35
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:44,020
Over the next few days,we will be
talking to each of you... individually.

36
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:50,830
You are entitled to bring along an attorney
or a union rep,should you so choose.

37
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,140
Why would we need an attorney?

38
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,270
Well,let's look at this
from our perspective,Kimball.

39
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,950
Your boss Bertram is a criminal.

40
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,090
Makes sense that you might be one,too.

41
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,790
We will be looking very
closely at all of you.

42
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:11,550
If you have ever done anything
even remotely questionable,

43
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:16,050
we will find out,and we will prosecute.

44
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:22,910
Unless,of course,we feel very,very
comfortable with your cooperation.

45
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,520
Then you got a little wiggle room.

46
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,550
***

47
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,910
The F.B.I. is overseeing
 an international manhunt

48
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:41,130
for prominent Sacramento law
enforcement official  Gail Bertram.

49
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:46,140
F.B.I. sources confirm that Bertram  is believed
to be the notorious serial killer Red John,

50
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:50,130
wanted for a string of grisly murders
 across the California heartland.

51
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,370
Hey,man.How's it going?

52
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,390
Do you have a pay phone?

53
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,940
It's right back there.

54
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,020
Thank you.

55
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:36,860
Hey,Ali,how you doing?

56
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,800
Uh,give me a pick 6... And one
of those pineapple cheroots.

57
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,330
Pick 6.

58
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,410
Cheroot.

59
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,350
Hello?

60
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,230
Hello,Patrick.

61
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,850
I don't have to use a funny
voice,do I?You know who this is.

62
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,590
Yes,I do.

63
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,600
It's weird,huh?

64
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,480
'Cause the
last time we--

65
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,400
Put your
hands up--

66
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:34,830
Hello?

67
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,610
Hello?

68
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,400
- Thanks.
- No problem.

69
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,030
Hello? Bertram?

70
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,640
Hello?

74
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,820
Clear,sir.

75
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,250
No kidding.

76
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,690
Where is he?

77
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:57,410
If you're asking about
Jane,I don't know.

78
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:59,250
Did you check upstairs?

79
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,010
Yeah.

80
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,970
You know,maybe you haven't heard.

81
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:09,330
About an hour ago,Gail Bertram killed
a cop at a gas station in east Sac.

82
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,070
I heard.

83
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:14,290
Did you hear what Bertram
was doing at the gas station?

84
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:17,790
- No.
- Using a pay phone.

85
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,480
Guess who he was calling.

86
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm gonna guess Jane.

87
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,980
Yeah.

88
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,270
So where is he?

89
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,680
I don't know.

90
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,390
I think you do.

91
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:30,940
I can't help what you think.

92
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:34,440
I think your boyfriend is
colluding with a dangerous fugitive.

93
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:40,210
I think he is up to his neck in this Blake
association craziness,and probably you are,too.

94
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:43,640
I'm not.He's not.

95
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:47,950
Jane can't help who calls
him,and he's not my boyfriend.

96
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,070
It's a damn shame,Teresa.

97
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,150
By all accounts... you were a good cop.

98
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:55,990
I still am.

99
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,010
- Hey,boss!
- Rigsby?

100
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:17,650
Is it safe?

101
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,000
Yeah.What are you doing?

102
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,480
We heard about what
Bertram did this morning.

103
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,220
We heard the F.B.I. were looking for us.

104
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,440
So what now?You're
hiding in the parking lot?

105
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,030
No. No,we're not hiding.

106
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,470
We're just... laying low.

107
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,980
Well,we're safe for now.There's no arrest
warrant that's put out for us just yet.

108
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,000
Give 'em time.

109
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,920
- Where's Jane?
- Don't ask.

110
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,210
She just did.

111
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:42,960
Listen to me.

112
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,590
The C.B.I. is gone now.

113
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:46,400
We're on our own.

114
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,590
You need to protect yourselves.

115
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,780
You don't know where Jane is,you
don't know what he's doing,

116
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,250
and you don't want to
know,you understand?

117
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:55,060
Yes,boss.

118
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:57,650
- Yes,boss.
- Yes,boss.

119
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,040
All right then.

120
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,750
But I am not your boss anymore.

121
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,170
That's the point.

122
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,260
We're on our own.

123
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,810
Yeah,we get it.

124
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:08,780
So where is he?

125
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,840
***

126
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,980
You're a wanted man.

127
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,640
Well,I like to think so.

128
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,960
Seriously.Abbott put an
actual warrant out on you.

129
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,810
It's not the first time.

130
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,540
So you gonna tell me,or what?

131
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,000
Oh,yeah.

132
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,130
Uh... Bertram called me.

133
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,100
I know.What did he say?

134
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,880
Well,whatever he wanted
to say,he didn't have time.

135
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,860
Why the hell is he still here?

136
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,180
What does he want?

137
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,600
I'm guessing he'll call
back soon and tell me.

138
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,950
- Your phone's not safe.The F.B.I.--
Yeah,they have a tap on the line.

139
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,310
But they don't have a trace yet.

140
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,470
If they had a trace,then
I'd be arrested already.

141
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,390
Maybe so,but sooner or
later,they'll get a trace on you.

142
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:01,780
I know.But I can't get rid of
my phone until Bertram calls.

143
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:04,880
It's all very suspenseful.

144
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,590
What does he want?

145
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:08,300
- Who?
- Bertram.

146
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,810
We'll see.

147
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,580
Now you're being evasive.

148
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:16,000
What beady little eyes birds have.

149
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,780
- Tiny dinosaurs,you know?
- I know.

150
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,320
I know you know what he wants.

151
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,800
What does he want?

152
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,200
Hello?

153
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,920
Oh,sorry I had to hang up on you.

154
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,570
It's been a busy day.

155
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,720
Yeah,no problem.You
know,this phone is not safe.

156
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,320
Let me call you back in a moment.

157
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:36,820
Yeah.

158
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,220
- What'd he say?
- Just a second.

159
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,720
How you doing?

160
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:44,420
I'll give you $100 for that phone.

161
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,920
$200 for that phone.

162
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,360
What's the catch?

163
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:53,640
No catch.

164
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:58,630
$300 plus... a replacement phone.

165
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,310
Uh,okay.

166
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,000
Yeah,dude,I'll call you right back.

167
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,360
Pleasure doing business with you.

168
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,630
Thanks,man.

169
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,720
What did he say?

170
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,300
Hello?

171
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,200
Look,I think we should meet and talk.

172
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,780
Just the two of us.

173
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,100
What,like a date?

174
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:22,290
Yes... No.

175
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,740
Look,the game is over.

176
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,240
I'd call it a very honorable tie.

177
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:34,850
And now that it's over,I really
think that we should talk.

178
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:39,060
You know,a truce.No
weapons,no tricks.Just talk.

179
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,220
Then we both walk away.

180
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,340
Talk.About what?

181
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:46,210
Well... everything.

182
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:49,500
I think we both could use
a little closure,don't you?

183
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,860
It has to be today.

184
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,330
You know,now.

185
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,800
I'm kind of pressed for time.

186
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:56,290
How do I know I can trust you?

187
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,520
Ah,don't be timid now,Patrick.

188
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:02,650
I could have killed you many
times,and I haven't,have I?

189
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,240
Okay. When and where?

190
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,060
Excellent.

191
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,660
I'll be at the Fremont Park
fountain in half an hour.

192
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,050
No.Don't know it.

193
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,880
Central bus station.

194
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,890
North entrance.

195
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,100
Nah,there's too many
people.There's too many cops.

196
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,300
You know Alexandria cemetery?

197
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,550
Of course I do.

198
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:23,180
Yeah,there's a chapel
by the Western gate.

199
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,590
That--that'll
do.

200
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:27,230
Half an hour.Don't be
late.I can't wait around.

201
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,900
Half an hour.

202
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,970
What'd he say?

203
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:35,430
He wants to meet with me.

204
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:37,150
It's a trap.

205
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,100
Probably.

206
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,180
Well,what are you gonna do?

207
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,820
I'm gonna meet him.

208
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,830
You can't.

209
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,100
Trust me,I know what I'm doing.

210
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,540
Jane,don't do this.Think about it.

211
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:51,590
The F.B.I. is gonna
get Bertram soon enough.

212
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:54,450
I don't want the F.B.I. to get him.

213
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:59,090
You knew this day was coming.

214
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:01,090
It's here.

215
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,040
Let me come with you.

216
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:03,620
No,I don't want you involved.

217
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,090
Involved? I am involved.

218
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,080
Not anymore.

219
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,590
I'm gonna need to borrow your gun.

220
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,430
- My gun?
- Yes,your gun.

221
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,930
I'm not gonna use it.Just a prop.

222
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,490
Teresa,trust me,please.

223
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:23,200
Just trust me.

224
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,730
Thank you.

225
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,490
Like that way.

226
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:02,950
Thanks.

227
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,940
Where's the man in charge here?

228
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:35,760
- Where is Abbott?
- Get down on your knees.

229
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,350
Keep your hands where I can see them.

230
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,930
Where is Abbott?I-I have to go.

231
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:41,220
All right,take it down a notch,people.

232
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,960
He's not Al Capone.

233
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:46,090
Abbott,please listen to me.

234
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,900
I can tell that you're a man of honor.

235
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:50,660
On my honor,I will give
myself up in an hour.

236
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:55,230
But right now I
just-- I just need...

237
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:59,040
Just...

238
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,360
Forget it.

239
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,000
no.no.no.no.No,tell me.Come on.

240
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,530
No,what do you need?What
do you need,huh?

241
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,430
You need an hour?

242
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,130
For what?

243
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,920
Where are you going?

244
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:13,710
Who are you gonna go meet?

245
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:16,390
No?

246
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,360
Well,let's take a
trip downtown,shall we?

247
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,050
No.You can let her go.

248
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,440
Hi,Miss Lisbon.

249
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:28,640
Do me this one favor,Abbott,cop to cop.

250
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:31,500
Let him go,and I swear I
will bring him back later.

251
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,610
Not happening.

252
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,020
And what is all this
urgency I'm hearing here?

253
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,190
You made a plan with Bertram.

254
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,840
Is that it?

255
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,320
Is that what you did?

256
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,720
Please,Abbott.

257
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:48,280
F.B.I.! Back it off!

258
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,710
CBI. Back it up yourself.

259
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,380
What's this?

260
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,370
Let him go,Abbott.He's
done nothing wrong.

261
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,990
Hey,guys.

262
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:57,800
You know,I-it's good to see you.

263
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:01,060
I hate to bring you
down,but there is no CBI.

264
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:06,390
That badge is a toy,and you're all
impersonating officers of the law.

265
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:07,600
Whatever.

266
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,070
Let him go.

267
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:14,430
Are you mad-dogging me
right now?The F.B.I.?

268
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:17,040
You say you're legit
F.B.I.,but how do we know?

269
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,920
Yeah,you could be members of the
Blake association for all we know.

270
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,140
We're not.

271
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,660
Prove it.

272
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:26,760
Your man Reede Smith
was a member.Why not you?

273
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:29,980
And how do we know Jane's not in danger?

274
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,120
That's absurd.

275
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,370
I'm sorry,agent Abbott,

276
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:35,930
but it is our duty to protect this
man until we're assured his safety.

277
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,210
Let him go.

278
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,990
No,no,no,no,no.

279
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,230
It's all right.Just stand
down.Stand down,guys.

280
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:46,570
No bloodshed required.It's cool.

281
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:50,000
- Let him go.
- Take my car.

282
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,050
- Sir?
- It's okay.

283
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:01,290
Thank you,guys!

284
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,800
We done?

285
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,340
He's gone.We're done.

286
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,270
Arrest them.

287
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,570
Put your guns down on
the ground... Slowly.

288
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:29,130
Do as he says.

289
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:42,130
Go track Agent Lisbon's vehicle.

290
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:43,350
Yes,sir.

291
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,780
You put a bug on my car?

292
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:48,180
How do you think we found Jane?

293
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:54,110
I said I was glad to see you people because I
knew you would screw up and make my life easy.

294
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:56,390
And you did just that.

295
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,630
Thank you.

296
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,150
Arrest her.

297
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,440
Come on.

298
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:00,960
Check it out. Check this out.

299
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,380
What's up?

300
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:05,220
Uh,could you guys keep an
eye on my car for me,please?

301
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,050
Sure,I'll watch it.

302
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:08,350
Thank you.

303
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,000
Let's go.

304
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,520
Yeah,man,no worries.

305
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,900
Yeah!

306
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,900
Sorry to bother you,ma'am.

307
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,290
Uh,long story.

308
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:56,550
Uh,I need--I need a
ride,if you're willing.

309
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:23,960
This is unit 4.

310
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:26,930
We have the vehicle in
sight,stationary on Fifth and Sherman.

311
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,450
Stay back,stay back.

312
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,290
This could be the meet.

313
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,320
What the heck?

314
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,840
Unit 4,what's the situation?

315
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,220
Unit 4,respond,damn it.

316
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,490
Boss,it was some kids in Lisbon's car.

317
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,900
Jane wasn't there.We don't have Jane.

318
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,980
Repeat.We don't
have Jane.Do you co--

319
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:55,800
Don't dig yourself any deeper.

320
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,020
Where did he go?

321
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,630
I don't know.

322
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:03,380
You guys really have
a death wish,don't you?

323
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,520
Sir,we really don't know.

324
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,750
"Sir"?

325
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:21,570
Why the hell are you calling him "sir"?

326
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,770
Oh,calm down,Dillinger.

327
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:24,800
We're under arrest here.We
might as well be civil.

328
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:26,290
Why?

329
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,970
You think you'll get a nicer cell?

330
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,510
Muchas gracias,Aurelio.

331
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:41,810
- De nada.
- Buena suerte.

332
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,630
Hey,Patrick.

333
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,820
I'm gonna need to
search you for weapons.

334
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,580
So you can go ahead,put your hands up.

335
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:48,670
Worth a shot.

336
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,320
You can go in now.

337
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,590
Patrick.

338
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:05,270
Thank you for being so punctual.

339
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,610
You lied to me.

340
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:11,450
Well... as did you.

341
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,760
What a couple of scamps we are,huh?

342
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:18,600
I promise that is the last
lie that I will ever tell you.

343
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,200
So... first things first.

344
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,180
You and the feds have
made a big mistake.

345
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:27,250
I'm not Red John.

346
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:48,530
- What?
- I'm not Red John.

347
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,840
I-I'm sorry to disappoint you,

348
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,810
but I'm just a humble foot
soldier in the Blake association.

349
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,100
Red John is one of the top brass.

350
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:01,060
I'm not sure I believe you.

351
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:04,210
Well... that's
your privilege,but--

352
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,920
but I am telling you the truth.

353
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,600
You all just jumped to
the wrong conclusion.

354
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,200
Okay,so who is Red John?

355
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,640
Oh,I have no idea.

356
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:19,020
No,h-honestly.

357
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:20,250
No idea.

358
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:24,560
The association works on a
strictly need-to-know basis.

359
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:28,160
Supposing what you say is true,then we
could have had this talk on the phone.

360
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,320
Yeah,but if we talked
on the phone,then you...

361
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,680
you probably wouldn't have
come to meet me,would you?

362
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:38,860
And I was told to call you,tell you
the game's over,and arrange a meeting.

363
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:41,460
Why? Why am I here?

364
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:49,440
Please... don't think for a
moment that I am happy about this.

365
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,170
The association doesn't like loose ends.

366
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,020
Just hates them.

367
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:59,790
So...

368
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,250
go on,Oscar.

369
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:07,880
No,no.Listen. Listen.

370
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,150
Let's-- let's
talk about this.

371
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,040
Just... w-wait.

372
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:12,810
Now I am truly sorry,but it
is totally out of my hands.

373
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:15,680
I always liked you,Patrick.

374
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,780
No. No.

375
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:22,260
This is not necessary.We
don't--don't--

376
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,300
Thank you,Oscar.

377
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:36,380
You can wait outside.

378
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:38,770
Just,uh... Make sure
we're left in peace.

379
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:50,130
Hello,Patrick.

380
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:15,140
Hello?!

381
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:17,140
Hey,what's going on?

382
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:20,830
- Grace,what are you--
What--please don't do that.

383
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,440
You're worse than Cho.

384
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:23,860
They need to tell us what's going on.

385
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:25,420
They don't need to do anything.

386
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,790
And we can't do anything,so
please just relax.

387
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:30,110
Relax?How can I relax?

388
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,900
You know,sometimes I think
you like being helpless.

389
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,580
Okay,fine,I take it back.Don't relax.

390
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:36,080
Just break the window with your forehead
and we'll all jump out and make a run for it.

391
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,360
Guys,let's try to keep it together,okay?

392
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,100
Okay,I'm sorry.

393
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,240
"Sorry."

394
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:48,390
- Mullins,you're from here,yes?
- Yes,sir.Over to Lincoln Heights.

395
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,870
Get me a map of Sacramento.

396
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,550
Yes,sir.There's one on
the computer in the car.

397
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:53,440
Paper map.

398
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:57,290
Paper... map.

399
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,310
Come on. Let's go.

400
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:03,590
Hey,do you have a paper map?

401
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:08,090
Well,Patrick,here we are.

402
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,250
Poor fella.

403
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:15,950
Smart but dumb.

404
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:21,290
It never occurred to him that
I am the Blake association.

405
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:23,600
Why'd you have to kill him?

406
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,910
Everyone thinks he's
Red John,don't they?

407
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:32,260
So... it would seem a fitting end to the
story if you two were found dead together.

408
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:34,630
No one will look any deeper.

409
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,390
So I'm supposed to die,am I?

410
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,200
After all these
years,seems kind of unfair.

411
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,410
It's totally fair.

412
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,670
The game's over,and I won.

413
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,670
It's not a game.

414
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:49,910
There's a winner and
a loser.That's a game.

415
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,940
It's not a game I asked to play.

416
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,050
No,but you played it
very well nonetheless.

417
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,930
You were fun,challenging.

418
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:57,620
Thank you.

419
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:04,380
You probably have a lot
of questions for me,huh?

420
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,560
We have time,if you want.

421
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,460
I have no questions.

422
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:13,730
You're an evil,sexually perverted sociopath
with pathetic delusions of grandeur.

423
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,490
The rest is just details.

424
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:20,110
"Evil,sexually perverted sociopath"?

425
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:24,990
Well,I guess I have
to own that,but,uh...

426
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:27,580
"Delusions of grandeur"?

427
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:31,370
No.I have no delusions.

428
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,010
I built a secret empire.

429
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:37,910
I control the lives
of thousands of people.

430
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:40,870
My word is life and death,and
nobody knows who I am.

431
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:44,170
Now if that's not grandeur,I
don't know what you call it.

432
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:48,140
I'd call it the ravings
of a squalid egomaniac.

433
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,210
You see?

434
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:55,200
For no reason at all,you...
you're rude and contemptuous.

435
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:59,180
That's why your wife and kid are dead.

436
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:05,260
Who are you to butt in here and
make obnoxious judgments about me?

437
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,440
Who are you?

438
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,020
Who are you?

439
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:16,690
- Nobody.
- Nobody.

440
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:19,400
You didn't know me.

441
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,420
You don't know me.

442
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:23,360
You have no idea.

443
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:28,030
Here's your problem,Pat.

444
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:31,430
You're a smart man,but you are arrogant.

445
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:35,290
You can't imagine
someone smarter than you.

446
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:38,200
Which is why I've been ahead of
you at every step along the way.

447
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,870
You're holding the gun.You want to brag?

448
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:43,090
Go ahead.I'm not gonna stop you.

449
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,400
You still don't know
how I fooled you,do you?

450
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,020
How did I survive that bomb?

451
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,500
How did I know all
the names on your list?

452
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,150
Is this what you've been missing?

453
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,700
Appreciation?

454
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:03,340
Do you want me to applaud?

455
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:05,850
You have no idea,do you?

456
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,450
I don't know how you
got the list of suspects.

457
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,520
That was a good trick.

458
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:14,120
But the bomb gag is
simple.There were two explosions.

459
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:16,230
The first was a concussion
bomb,knocked everyone out.

460
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:20,110
The second,lethal bomb
that killed Haffner

461
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,920
and Stiles only went off after you
dragged Bertram and me out of harm's way.

462
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,430
Correct.

463
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:30,390
Faking your own death was easy.

464
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:32,770
Brett Partridge was Blake association.

465
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:36,950
His job gave him access to
the primary D.N.A. database.

466
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:40,910
He switched your D.N.A. records
with a body that you had on ice.

467
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:43,930
A surrogate.

468
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:50,040
And you brought the body to my house in the trunk of
your car and you put it alongside Stiles and Haffner.

469
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,260
Very good.

470
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:56,200
Your hindsight is 20/20.

471
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:01,430
Can I show you something?

472
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:04,400
Sure.

473
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,830
Bread crumbs?

474
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:46,900
Birds.

475
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:50,000
Very clever.

476
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:52,290
The bomb was a mistake.

477
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,760
It was theater.

478
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:58,400
I knew that whatever the truth
looked like,the opposite must be true.

479
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:05,910
Please don't.Don't kill me.

480
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,870
Oh,now you want mercy?

481
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:10,500
After all you've done?

482
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:14,460
You're not like me.

483
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:16,450
You're a good man.

484
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:18,360
It'll haunt you.

485
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:20,970
Oh,I'm not hesitating.

486
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:23,420
I'm just savoring the moment.

487
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:28,910
You're Red John.

488
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:35,580
I have to say I'm a little disappointed.

489
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:42,290
Oh,my God!

490
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,580
Help!Please!He's gonna kill me!

491
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:46,680
Oh,my God!

492
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,730
I'm a policeman,and you need to leave.

493
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:51,550
Sir,I'm sorry,you don't
look like a policeman.

494
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,700
Yes,I am.Just do as I
say and leave right now.

495
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:56,570
Please put down that gun.

496
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:57,960
You need to go.

497
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:01,110
Whatever's happened here,more
violence is not the answer.

498
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,250
No,you don't understand.

499
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:03,450
Sir,I do understand.

500
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:06,790
- I know how angry you must--
No,you don't,and you have to go now!

501
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,500
Sir,in all good
conscience--

502
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:47,910
All right,so he started out here,and
he dumped the car here at a mini-mall.

503
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:49,790
So where would you arrange a meeting?

504
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:53,570
Someplace with easy access,in
and out,close to the highway.

505
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:55,070
Ballpark.

506
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:56,270
Too much security.

507
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:57,220
What's that?

508
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:58,410
Community college campus.

509
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,250
No,that,right there.

510
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,170
That's the Alexandria cemetery.

511
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,320
Where was Jane's wife buried?

512
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,160
- What does that have to
do-- where was she buried?

513
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,470
Alexandria cemetery.

514
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:10,860
Thanks.

515
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:12,970
Alexandria cemetery.Let's go!

516
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,950
Oh,my God.

517
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,030
Oh,no.

518
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,520
Oh,my God!

519
00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:41,520
Help!

520
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,490
Please!

521
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,780
Help!

522
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,480
Which way?

523
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,930
Over there.

524
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,100
"B" team,canvass this side.

525
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,460
Denyer,you're with me.

526
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:41,340
- Let's go.Let's go now.Come on.
- Let's see if he's here.

527
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,020
What was that?

528
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:05,230
Oh,my--
oh!

529
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:07,310

Oh,my--oh!

530
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:11,810
No!

531
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,130
What's going on?

532
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,240
I'm on the line with the police.

533
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:20,790
I am police,ma'am.Let me talk to them.

534
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,200
Thank you.

535
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,540
This way?

536
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,130
Uh,um,yeah,well...

537
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:05,230
Ah,hell.

538
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,430
9-1-1. What's
your emergency?

539
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:42,910
Hello.

540
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,390
Ma--
Hello?

541
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,900
9-1-1. What's
your emergency?

542
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:53,250
Please don't kill me. Let me live.

543
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:55,140
9-1-1. What's
your emergency?

544
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:58,520
Please... let me live.

545
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,230
I'll tell you how I got
the names on your list.

546
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:06,180
I don't care.

547
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:08,580
I-I knew because I
have real psychic--

548
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:16,000
I want you to blink once
for "no" and twice for "yes."

549
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:23,860
Are you sorry that you
killed my wife Angela

550
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,050
and my daughter Charlotte?

551
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,620
Good.

552
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:38,100
Good.

553
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:41,780
Are you afraid to die?

554
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:48,150
Good.

555
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,800
Don't even think about it.

556
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:47,450
Lisbon... It's over.

557
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,630
It's done.

558
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:54,110
I just want you to know I'm okay.

559
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,050
And I'm gonna miss you.

560
