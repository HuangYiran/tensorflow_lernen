成长于八十年代
Growing up in the '80s,

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,370
我不仅仅是热爱电影 更是活在其中
I didn't just love movies-- I lived them.

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,430
也许稍有点过了
Maybe a little too much.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,340
嘿 小家伙
Hey, little buddy.

嘿 巴里 想加入我的电影吗
Hey, Barry. You want to be in my movie?

乐意之极
I'd love nothing more.

7
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:19,900
好 我在游戏网格线里
Okay, so I'm inside the game grid,

8
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:22,170
我有这些身份磁盘 你要...
and I have these identity discs, and you're gonna...

9
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,210
收工了 呆子
That's a wrap, nerd.

10
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:29,380
我们街道上没有孩子和我一起玩
I had no kids on my street to play with,

11
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,350
而我的哥哥姐姐对我的爱好
and my older siblings weren't exactly interested

12
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,890
不那么感兴趣
in my hobbies.

13
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,100
呦
Yo.

14
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:36,210
呦
Yo.

15
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,330
干嘛
Whatcha up to?

16
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,920
没事
Nothin'. 

17
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,850
你好像在拍自己骑着
'Cause it looks like you were filming yourself

18
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,080
电子世界争霸战炫光坐骑出逃游戏网格
on a "Tron" light cycle escaping the game grid.

19
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,080
{\an8}电子世界争霸战 迪斯尼1982年出品的超现实主义科幻题材影片


20
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:44,260
你看过电子世界争霸战
You've seen "Tron."

21
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,360
十六次
16 times.

22
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,140
我妈妈都有点担心了
My mom's actually kinda worried.

23
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:48,660
嗨 我是亚当
Hi, I'm Adam.

24
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:49,720
我是查德...克伦普
I'm Chad... Kremp.

25
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,610
我们刚搬到街对面
We just moved in across the street.

26
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,050
想不想看看我的炫光坐骑
You wanna check out my light cycle?

27
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,080
好的 耶
Sure. Yeah.

28
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:57,110
就这样 我有了一个新邻居和好朋友
And just like that, I had a new neighbor and best friend.

29
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,650
虽然我们有很多相同的地方
Even though we had so much in common,

30
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,970
我们的家人却大相径庭
our families couldn't have been more different.

31
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,640
克伦普一家细语轻声的
The Kremps were soft-spoken...

32
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,290
嗨 查德能玩会儿吗
Hi. Can chad play?

33
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,210
查德 宝贝 你的朋友在这儿呢

34
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,380
戈德堡家喜欢大吼大叫
And the Goldbergs liked to yell.

35
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,980
嗨 亚当能玩会儿吗
Hi. Can Adam play?

36
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:15,620
亚当 赶紧给我滚下来 
Adam! Get your ass down here!

37
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,700
克伦普家有个美丽的花店...
The Kremps owned a fancy flower shop...

38
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:18,780
这儿 亚当
Here, Adam.

39
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,340
把这些带回家送给你妈妈吧
Why don't you take these home to your mother?

40
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:21,100
为什么
Why?

41
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,780
戈德堡家拥有一个折扣家具店
The Goldbergs owned a discount furniture store.

42
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:26,310
嘿...离那家具远点儿
Hey... Get off the furniture!

43
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,960
我还得拿这玩意儿卖钱呢
I gotta sell this crap.

44
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:30,730
这就是克伦普家典型的周六下午...
This was a typical Saturday afternoon at the Kremps'...

45
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,640
刚才挺厉害的 不是么 儿子
Put a little pepper on that one, didn't you, son?

46
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:34,930
从最厉害的人那学来的
I learned from the best.

47
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,890
嘿 给我的主场球队来点柠檬水
Hey, lemonade for my home team. 

48
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,810
而戈德堡家的周六下午
While a Saturday afternoon at the Goldbergs'

49
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:39,580
更像是这种...
Looked more like this...

50
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,170
搞什么鬼 巴里・戈德堡
What the hell? Barry Goldberg,

51
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,750
立刻把你的屁股从那棵树上挪开
you get your butt out of that tree right now!

52
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,710
什么傻瓜会被困到一棵树上
What kind of moron gets stuck in a tree?

53
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,590
亚当说我爬不了那么高
Adam said I couldn't climb this high.

54
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,050
- 我爬给他看看 - 你显然做到了 
- I showed him! - You sure did.

55
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,620
你要是不赶紧下来
If you don't come down right now,

56
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,320
我这就去拿水管
I am gonna go get the hose!

57
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,750
你不会喷你的儿子的
You're not gonna spray our son.

58
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,630
- 停 - 埃里卡
- Stop! - Erica--

59
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,280
别玩那个球了!
Enough with the ball! 

60
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,960
马上就拿软管来了
The hose is the way to go. 

61
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,700
额 他是个把自己困在树上的傻瓜
Um, he's the idiot that got himself stuck up there.

62
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,590
我会试着够到他
I'll try and catch him--

63
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,750
嘿 邻居 嗨
Hey, neighbors! Hi!

64
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,560
我们来办一场书上的烧烤会吧 怎么样
We have got to get that barbecue on the books, don't we?

65
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:08,570
- 绝对的 - 好极了
- Definitely. - That'd be great.

66
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,680
- 他是个傻瓜 - 的确
- He's a moron! - He is!

67
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:14,010
- 嗨 - 这就是"戈德堡家的第一印象"
- Hi! - And that's what you'd call "a Goldberg first impression."

68
00:02:15,809 --> 00:02:18,995
戈德堡一家 第一季08集


69
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,430
很久之前还没有手机时
Long before cell phones, 

70
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,130
只有一条电话线...
you only had one phone line... 

71
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,040
它就是所有问题的根源
And it was the source of all problems. 

72
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,590
- 挂电话 挂电话 - 等会 蕾妮
- Get off the phone. Get off the phone. - Hold on, Lainey.

73
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,790
- 挂电话 - 我在讲话
- Get off the phone. - I'm talking!

74
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,130
走开 不然我就拣你脑袋上软的地方揍一拳
Go away, or I'll punch you in the soft part of your skull.

75
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,900
妈妈让你别打我那儿
Mom told you not to punch me there.

76
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,080
给我电话 我要打个重要的电话
Now give me the phone. I got an important call to make.

77
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,190
真的 什么这么重要
Really? What's so important?

78
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,470
我要给罗杰打电话
I gotta call Roger.

79
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,550
他借了我的曲棍球棍
He borrowed my hockey stick,

80
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,110
而我在外面发现了个黄蜂窝
and I found a hornet's nest out back.

81
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,410
你的生活实在是悲哀简单
Your life is so sad and simple.

82
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,310
去
Go.

83
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,990
不 挂电话
No. Get off the phone.

84
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,810
- 挂电话 挂电话 - 嘿 知道么...
- Get off the phone. Get off the phone-- - Hey, you know...

85
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,180
我在和你们那么大的时候 喜欢收音机
When I was your age, I was a radio man

86
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,440
有103频道 和法国人英国人一起
with the 103rd, working with the French and the British. 

87
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:03,760
我们尽管共享一条线路
We shared one line,

88
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,980
还是一起设法赢了战争
and we still managed to win the war.

89
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,980
请别再讲这些故事了行么
Can you please stop with these stories?

90
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,000
这儿有个现实问题
This is a real life situation here.

91
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,910
爸 我们需要第二根电话线
Dad, we gotta get a second phone line.

92
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,530
两根电话线
Two phone lines?

93
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,600
你以为这是哪儿 白宫吗
What does this look like-- the White House?

94
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:18,150
另一根电话线 这可能吗
A second line-- is that even possible

95
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,690
所有的线交叉出入
with all those wires crossing in and out?

96
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,460
它们能做到吗
Can they even do that?

97
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:25,110
当波普斯理解不了电话的工作原理时
While pops couldn't understand how the phone worked,

98
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,430
我妈妈不理解为什么克伦普一家
my mom couldn't understand why the Kremps

99
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,590
一直躲着她的烧烤会邀请
kept ducking her barbecue invitation.

100
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,340
这太荒谬了
This is getting ridiculous.

101
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,290
我对克伦普一家一直很友好...
I have been nothing but nice to the Kremps...

102
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,530
而他们显然在疏远我们
And they're clearly blowing us off.

103
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,300
我的意思是 他们为什么要躲开我们呢
I mean, why would they want to avoid us?

104
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,140
你干什么了
What did you do?

105
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:44,940
什么
What?

106
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:48,460
你听到我说的了 你...干什么了
You heard me. What... Did you do?

107
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,290
我都没和他们说过一句话
I haven't said a word to those people.

108
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,880
行了 这就是问题所在
Well, that's the problem right there.

109
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,320
你不友好 你都不跟他们打招呼
You're not friendly, you don't say "Hi,"

110
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:54,960
你穿着内裤浇院子
You water the yard in your underpants.

111
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,320
这让人不舒服
It's disconcerting.

112
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,730
看起来像是你存心要把人们赶走
It's like you're trying to drive people away.

113
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,810
那是因为我真的想把别人赶走
That's because I am trying to drive people away.

114
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,090
好吧 这就是为什么你没朋友 默里
Well, that is why you have no friends, Murray.

115
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,730
家里人满为患
I live in a house full of people

116
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,590
一刻都不让人清闲
who won't leave me the hell alone.

117
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,150
有这些朋友足够了
That's all the friends I need.

118
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,840
好吧 你可能不想要朋友 可是我想要
Well, you may not want friends, but I do.

119
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,360
给我过去
Go over there and apologize

120
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:14,660
为自己不穿裤子脾气暴躁向人家道歉
for being a pantsless grumpy pants.

121
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:17,340
我要为做我自己向人家道歉
I should apologize for being me?

122
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,380
对
Yes!

123
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:25,400
嗨 我是 呃  对面街的默里・戈德堡 
Hi. I'm, uh, Murray Goldberg from across the street.

124
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:29,030
只是想过来正式地介绍自己
Just thought I'd come over and formally introduce myself.

125
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,320
查尔斯・克伦普 很高兴认识你
Charles Kremp. Pleasure to meet you.

126
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,390
- 进来吧 - 噢 好 谢谢
- Come on in. - Oh, okay. Thank you.

127
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,730
这个地方真好闻
This place smells great!

128
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,180
是栀子花香
It's the gardenias.

129
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,590
这是职业兴趣 我是个花店老板
It's a perk of the job. I'm a florist.

130
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,370
- 噢 工作怎么样 - 不错
- Oh, how about that? - That's right.

131
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:45,400
我们浴室里有一个...一个花洒
We have a... a flower spray that we keep in the bathroom.

132
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,760
也不错
It tries.

133
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,650
但是我想说的是
But the point is,

134
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,660
我是过来邀请你去烧烤的
I am here to invite you to a barbecue.

135
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,880
对 那... 那件事
Yes, that... That situation.

136
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:56,760
这么说...还真有事 是吗
So... It is a situation, huh?

137
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,390
今后
From now on,

138
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,290
我会尽量 呃
I will try and, uh,

139
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,790
出门的时候穿好裤子
wear pants when I go outside.

140
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,700
尽量
Try. 

141
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,420
实话说 呃... 我...我老婆弗吉尼亚...
To be honest, um... My...my wife Virginia...

142
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,640
她有点敏感
She can be a little sensitive,

143
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,200
还有 呃...
and, uh...

144
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:16,410
怎么说呢... 你老婆吓到她了
How to put this... your wife scares her.

145
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:18,320
什么
What? 

146
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,450
那天 我爸终于要做一件
That day, my father finally got to do something

147
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,980
他打结婚那天就一直梦寐以求的事...
he had been waiting for since the day he got married...

148
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,250
指责别人
Be right!

149
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,760
是你
It's you!

150
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,440
- 什么 - 你听着
- What? - You heard me.

151
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:32,500
不是我的问题
It's not me that's the problem.

152
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:33,890
是你
It's you!

153
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:34,950
我做错什么了
What did I do?

154
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,160
噢... 你吓到那女的了
Oh... You scare the woman.

155
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,470
狠狠地吓了她一把
Scare her but good.

156
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,410
太荒唐了
That is ridiculous.

157
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,550
我除了对她很热情之外什么也没做
I have never been anything but cordial to her.

158
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,250
她怎么会不喜欢我
How can she not like me?

159
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,320
你大叫 呃 你在屋里大叫 在屋外也大叫
You yell. Uh, you yell inside, you yell outside.

160
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,460
还有很明显 你爬到垃圾车上
And apparently, you climbed up on a garbage truck

161
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,860
对着清洁工大叫
to yell at the garbage man.

162
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,710
他车已经开到半路
And he drove halfway down the block

163
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,510
你还挂在车后
with you hanging off the back.

164
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,150
所以然后他就开回来把我们的旧水槽收走了
And then he drove back and picked up our old sink.

165
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,070
不客气
You're welcome.

166
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,680
随你怎么说 贝弗 
Explain it any way you want to, Bevy.

167
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:05,790
那女的不喜欢你
That woman no likey you.

168
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,120
但有人不喜欢我妈的这个念想
But the idea of someone not liking my mom

169
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,560
却不会就这样消失
was not gonna fly.

170
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,720
贝弗莉・戈德堡一心想
Beverly Goldberg prided herself on 

171
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,060
成为万人迷
being loved by all.

172
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,410
她会为此大费周章
And she couldn't have it any other way.

173
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,520
喔喔 弗吉尼亚
Whoo-hoo! Virginia!

174
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,630
她把暴走变成了跟踪
She turned power walking into power stalking.

175
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,190
我刚刚没看见你
I didn't see you there.

176
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,850
噢 我不知道你也暴走
Oh. I didn't know you power walked.

177
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,380
真巧啊
What a coincidence.

178
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,630
我每天都走
I do it every day.

179
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,830
才没有
She didn't.

180
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,720
好吧 我要..继续了
Well, I should... Keep moving.

181
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:41,140
- 我刚达到燃脂峰值 所以... - 噢 不错
- I just hit my peak burn period. So... - Oh, good stuff,

182
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,620
不错 听着...
good stuff. Listen...

183
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,390
我想我们一开始处得不是很愉快
I feel like we got off on the wrong foot,

184
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,190
但我相信我们会成为好朋友的
and I know we're gonna be great friends.

185
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,550
所以 求你了 过来烧烤吧
So please, come over for a barbecue.

186
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,150
可以
Sure.

187
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,220
当然可以 我会通知你的
Sure, I'll let you know.

188
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,380
现在吗 好 呃 周六怎么样
Now? Okay, uh, how about Saturday?

189
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,820
我感觉周六会下雨
I think it's supposed to rain on Saturday.

190
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,360
太好了 就周六了 说定了
Great, Saturday it is. Mark it down.

191
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:58,460
你不用带什么东西
You don't have to bring anything

192
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:01,170
就带着开放的态度 还有四个配菜
except an open mind and four sides.

193
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,160
不 带一个也行 如果你想的话
No. Just one side, if you want.

194
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,370
好的
Okay.

195
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,290
- 我要继续了 - 好 我来带头
- I'm gonna keep moving. - Okay, I'll lead.

196
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,120
噢 啊 抽筋 抽筋 抽筋
Oh! Aah! Cramp, cramp, cramp.

197
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:13,820
好吧 周六 期待着留下美好回忆吧
Okay, Saturday it is. Prepare to make some memories.

198
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,870
当我妈在努力尝试跟克伦普
While my mom was trying to make a connection

199
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,730
交朋友时
with Mrs. Kremp...

200
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,390
我哥却想给自己交朋友
My brother was hoping to make a connection of his own.

201
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,030

别跟爸爸告状 求你了

219
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,850
那还挺难取舍的
Hmm, that's hard to pass up.

220
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:02,600
爸爸 巴里在给976热线打电话

221
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:04,540

224
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,370
我从来没超过两分钟
and I never go beyond the second minute.

225
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,130
我用的是拼字游戏里的计时器
I use the timer from Boggle. 

226
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:12,820

230
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,040
怎么也怪我了
that you want to get frisky in a rowboat?

231
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:24,280
我可没这么打算
That wasn't the selection I was gonna make.

232
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:25,930
你麻烦大了
Okay, now you're in trouble.

233
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,590
你儿子老是拨打色情电话
Your son has been calling smut numbers.

234
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,490
我可不管 我有要事要跟你谈谈
I don't care. I have something very important to tell you.

235
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,640
克伦普一家要过来一起吃烧烤了
The Kremps are coming over for a barbecue.

236
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:37,430
哇 这可是大事啊
Yes! That is big!

237
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,890
我们应该专注于这个而不是抓住我不放对吧
Now let's focus on this and not my thing.

238
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,140
再说点儿关于这个盛大的烧烤活动吧
Tell us more about this important barbecue.

239
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,300
等等 你是说克伦普全家都来
Wait, are we talking about all the Kremps here,

240
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,740
那些男孩也会来吗
like, the boys, too--

241
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,630
那个跟亚当同岁的男孩 还有那个跟我同岁
The one that's Adam's age, and the one that's my age

242
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,670
棕发蓝眼的那个
with sandy brown hair and blue eyes?

243
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,190
尽管那女人被你吓到了
You still want to have a barbecue with these people,

244
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,110
你还是想跟他们一起烧烤吗
even though that woman's terrified of you?

245
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,220
不再会啦
Not anymore.

246
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,900
今早我起床后
I woke up early this morning,

247
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,910
徒步追了她两英里路
followed her for 2 miles on foot,

248
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,920
赶上她并且说服她
then chased her down and convinced her

249
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,990
我没什么好害怕的
there's nothing scary about me.

250
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,910
拜托 这周本来很清闲的
Come on. I had nothing planned this weekend.

251
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,080
是个完美周末
It was perfect.

252
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,210
那你现在有事做啦 你得表现的热情
Well, now you do. And you will be warm

253
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,970
好客 行行好
and inviting, and so help me god,

254
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,170
最好不要在客人面前睡着了
you better not fall asleep in front of these people.

255
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,170
好 我们开始准备吧
Okay! Let's get cookin'!

256
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,640
脱下 赶紧脱下来
Off. Take it off.

257
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,320
这可是打破僵局的绝活儿
It's an icebreaker...

258
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:22,630
有时候用途还不止这个
Sometimes more.

259
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,950
老爸 他们可是有教养的人
Dad, these are good people.

260
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,520
我们得注意言行举止
We need to be on our best behavior.

261
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:30,070
不能说黄色笑话 打油诗 讲黄段子之类的
That means no dirty jokes, no limericks, no lewd comments.

262
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,390
听起来真是个无聊的聚会
This party sounds like a real drag.

263
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,770
至于你们呢
As for the rest of you,

264
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,630
不要大喊大叫 不要骂人 不要打架
no yelling, no cursing, no fighting.

265
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:38,820
记住我的话
Mark my words.

266
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,520
这一定是后院烧烤会有史以来
This will be the best backyard barbecue

267
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:45,030
最好的后院烧烤会
in the history... Of backyard barbecues.

268
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,240
也可能不是
Or not.

269
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:50,400
这将会是一个跟克伦普一家共度的风雨交加的周末
It was gonna be a very stormy weekend with the Kremps.

270
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:52,510
尽管烧烤期间下起了雨
Even though it rained during the big barbecue,

271
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,790
也没有阻止我跟查迪特 
didn't stop me and Chad

272
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,480
热情满腔地唱"帝国反击战"
from reciting "Empire Strikes Back" by heart.

273
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,580
# 不不 这不是真的 #
No, no, that's not true.

274
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:01,230
# 这是不可能的 #
That's impossible.

275
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,430
也没有阻止我姐姐跟德鲁・克伦普热络起来
It also didn't stop my sister from warming up to Drew Kremp,

276
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,020
没有妨碍我老爸打瞌睡
or my dad from falling asleep,

277
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,360
也没有打消我妈妈跟弗吉尼亚 
or my mom from trying to get Virginia 

278
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,380
套近乎
to warm up to her.

279
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:11,400
- 我给你倒了点酒 - 你说什么
- I brought you some wine. - What?!

280
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:12,850
我给你倒了点酒
I brought you some wine.

281
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,070
抱歉 我听不清
I'm sorry. I can't hear you.

282
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,750
噢 抱歉 我天生声音轻柔
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so naturally soft-spoken.

283
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,940
我给你倒了点酒
I brought you some wine.

284
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:20,190
有人要热狗吗
Okay, who needs dogs?

285
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,810
真是太感谢了 
Thank you so much. Look--

286
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,720
瞧 你把面包都烤热了
Oh, you warmed my buns.

287
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,720
{\an8}bun 还有臀部的意思


288
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:26,500
嗯
Yes.

289
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:28,450
这么大根火腿我都不知道能不能吃完
I don't know if I can handle all this meat.

290
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,420
她这是在跟我开玩笑吗
Is she kidding me with this?

291
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:31,010
别瞎想
Just go.

292
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,540
大家都玩得不怎么高兴
No one was really enjoying themselves...

293
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,050
除了巴里
Except for Barry.

294
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:38,560
你好啊 姐姐
Hello, sister.

295
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,980
真是个适合烧烤的好天气啊 对吧
Perfect day for a barbecue, isn't it?

296
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,900
怪咖 外面下大雨呢
No, weirdo. It's pouring outside.

297
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,080
噢 真是抱歉
Oh, I'm sorry.

298
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:46,480
我是说 这真是个复仇的好时机啊
I meant, it's a perfect day for revenge.

299
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,600
德鲁・克伦普真是太可口了
Drew Kremp is so delicious.

300
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,060
真想把他蘸着牛奶吃掉
I want to dunk him in a glass of milk and eat him up.

301
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,670
搞什么啊
What the hell?

302
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,490
你竟然录制我的私人通话
You recorded my private phone call?

303
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,350
真好笑 我只是碰巧在你打电话的时候
Funny... How I just happened to pick up

304
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,710
拿起了听筒
when you were on the phone.

305
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,060
我要不要在大伙儿面前把剩余的录音播放出来娱乐一下呢
Should I play the rest for the guests we're entertaining?

306
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:01,940
好吧 你赢了
Okay, you win.

307
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,510
你随时都可以打电话 可以了吧
You can use the phone whenever you want, okay?

308
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,470
千万不要放出来 拜托了
Just please don't play it, I'm begging you.

309
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,180
正像我之前求你不要告诉老爸的时候呢
Kind of like how I begged you not to tell dad, huh?

310
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:10,980
或许你可以提醒我一下这是怎么发生的呢
Perchance, can you remind me how that turned out?

311
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,950
少这样阴阳怪气说话了 把这该死的磁带给我
Will you stop talking like that and just give me the  damn tape?

312
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,970
- 不给 - 你给我
- No. - Just give it--

313
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,420
才不给你 放手
Not giving it to you. Stop it!

314
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,700
别给脸不要脸啊
You're embarrassing yourself.

315
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,990
- 给我 - 松手
Give it-- stop!

316
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,640
松手
Stop!

317
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,350
"埃里卡・克伦普"听起来不错吧
I mean, doesn't "Erica Kremp" sound perfect?

318
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,870
等我们结婚了 我们要一起滑雪
When we get married, we're gonna ski

319
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,590
要整天说法语 还会生出超级漂亮的金发小宝贝
and speak French all day and have super blonde kids.

320
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,240
-  噢 我的天 - 这可不是我所计划的
- Oh, dear. - That... Was not the plan.

321
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,790
那你计划干嘛
What was the plan?

322
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,600
你还打算干嘛
What was the plan?! 

323
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:36,960
孩子们 够了
Kids, enough! 

324
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,670
他们其实不是这样的
This is so out of character for them. 

325
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,960
- 我要打你 - 走开
- Let me punch you! - Get off me!

326
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:42,490
孩子们 我教过你们不要打对方私处
Kids, I told you not to punch each other in the privates.

327
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,240
你俩都不许用电话了
No phone for either of you. 

328
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:45,250
别动
Stop moving!

329
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,790
给我吃
Eat it!

330
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,790
默里 你给我醒过来
Murray, wake the up!

331
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,720
唔 你看 天色已晚
Well, you know, it's-- it's getting late.

332
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:57,650
我们该回去了 好吧 再见啦 玩得很开心
We should probably head out. Okay. Bye-bye now.  Good time.

333
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,990
一周过去了 我都没见到查德
A week went by, and I hadn't seen Chad.

334
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,720

谢天谢地 Pops总在我需要的时候及时出现
Thankfully, pops was always there when I needed him.

335
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:05,270
好的 准备好了吗
Okay, and we're rolling.

336
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,510
开始
Action!

337
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:09,730
我第一句台词是什么
What's my first line?

338
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,250
哦 拜托 没开玩笑吧
Oh, come on, seriously?

339
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,250
你把果汁喷趣酒弄到衣服上了
You got fruit punch on your suit?

340
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,090
哦 没关系的
Oh, it's okay.

341
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,600
我...我赋予了这个角色很多想法
I...I've given the character a lot of thought.

342
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:18,570
这个机器人很喜欢果汁喷趣酒
This robot loves fruit punch.

343
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,700
他是个脏兮兮的机器人
He's a messy robot.

344
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,740
我说过了 你不是个机器人
I told you, you're not a robot.

345
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:24,870



346
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:29,320
或者是...他不进计算机世界
Or... Instead of him going to a computer world,

347
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:31,900
让他去果汁世界怎么样
how about he goes to a juice world?

348
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,580
根本没有果汁世界这种东西
There's no such thing as a juice world!

349
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,260
但是计算机世界就是真的吗
But computer worlds are real?

350
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,350
赶紧的吧
Just go.

351
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,430
我不明白为什么机器人就不能喜欢果汁
I don't know why a robot can't like juice.

352
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,720
查德今天去哪儿了
Where's Chad today?

353
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,620
呃... 我... 我觉得他没空
Uh... I...I don't think he's available.

354
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:44,850
什么意思
What do you mean?

355
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,600
他妈妈说了
His mom just said

356
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,330
我们暂时不能一起玩
we can't play together for a while.

357
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,650
什么
What?!

358
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,830
那女人疯了
The nerve of that woman.

359
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,030
我现在就过去那边
I'm marching over there right now

360
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,530
好好教训她一顿
and giving her a piece of my mind.

361
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:56,950
不 等等 她最怕的就是你
No! Wait! Your mind is the part that scares her the most.

362
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,920
答应我 别去那儿
Promise me you won't go over there.

363
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:01,400
求你了 你只会让事情变得更糟
Please. You'll just make it worse.

364
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,840
好吧 小可爱
All right, love bug.

365
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,540
我不会去那儿 我保证
I won't go over there, I promise.

366
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,610
我妈说到做到
My mom was a woman of her word.

367
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,590
她没去那儿
She didn't march over there.

368
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,320
但是 她打了电话
Instead, she called.

369
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:14,290
你好 这里是克伦普家
Hello. You've reached the Kremps.

370
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:17,540
请留言 祝您有愉快的一天
Please leave a message and have a wonderful day.

371
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,390
弗吉尼亚 我是贝弗莉・戈德堡 快接电话
Virginia, it's Beverly Goldberg. Pick up.

372
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:24,100
哦 拜托 我看到你躲在窗帘后面了
Oh, please, I see you lurking behind the curtain

373
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,690
你在自己家 跟个怪人似的
like a weirdo in your own home.

374
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,560
能快点接起电话吗
Would you pick up the phone already?

375
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,090
太抱歉了 我刚刚在洗澡
So sorry, I was just in the shower.

376
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,720
别废话 告诉我为啥亚当不能跟查德一起玩
Cut the crap and tell me why Adam can't play with Chad.

377
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,630
抱歉 我只是...
I'm sorry. Look, I just...

378
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,120
觉得我们是风格迥异的人...
Think that we have different styles--

379
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:38,390
在孩子面前的
Different ways of speaking

380
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,030
说话方式不同
in front of our children,

381
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,870
总体上是...
and just generally...

382
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,230
世界上两种不同的存在
Different ways of being in the world.

383
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,340
好的
Fine.

384
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,350
如果查德不能跟亚当一起玩
If Chad can't play with Adam,

385
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,830
亚当也不能跟查德一起玩
Adam can't play with Chad.

386
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,970
我也不会介意你是否喜欢我
And I could give a hoot whether or not you like me

387
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:56,600
因为我有一大堆朋友 知道吗
because I have buttloads of friends, okay?

388
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:58,300
一大堆
Buttloads.

389
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:04,970
我...遵守诺言了
I... Kept my promise.

390
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,620
我没有去她家
I didn't go over there.

391
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:09,970
就这样
And just like that,

392
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,870
我妈扼杀了我跟查德的友谊
my mom had hung up on my friendship with Chad.

393
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,630
但是我们并不是唯一玩过界的小孩
But we weren't the only ones getting our lines crossed.

394
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,330
我哥和我姐关于电话的战争
My brother and sister's battle over the phone

395
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,890
第二天仍在继续
had stretched on another day.

396
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,330
但是巴里很快发现 战争
But what Barry would soon realize was the fight

397
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,930
即将在屋外进行
was about to be taken outside.

398
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:28,590
我是认真的 蕾妮
I'm serious, Lainey. 

399
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:30,330
德鲁・克伦普什么都听见了
Drew Kremp heard everything.

400
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,280
我打算辍学 然后逃出镇子
I'm thinking of quitting school and skipping town.

401
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,220
完蛋了 你彻底完蛋了
Busted! You are so busted,

402
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,240
我会告诉爸妈 胜者还是我
and I'm telling, and Barry wins.

403
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,900
爸妈说我们不能用屋里的电话
Mom and dad said we couldn't use the phone in the house.

404
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:42,530
从技术层面上说...我已经不在屋里了
Technically... I'm outside the house.

405
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,100
真是高明
That's very intelligent.

406
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,550
给我 我要打电话
Give it to me! I gotta make a call!

407
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,730
不行 这是我的主意
No way! It was my idea!

408
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,880
- 快给我 - 给我停下
- Just give it to me! - Stop!

409
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,130
蕾妮 别挂
Lainey, hold on!

410
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,840
把它...给...我
Give it... To... Me.

411
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,600
你把它弄坏了
You broke it!

412
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,880
也许你该拨打976新电话
Maybe you should call 9-7-6-new-phone.

413
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:04,430
也许你该拨打...
Maybe you should call...

414
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,570
闭嘴
Shut up!

415
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,810
你搞笑呢
Are you kidding me?!

416
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,440
我做过的事都不后悔
I stand by what I did.

417
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:11,410
天哪
God!

418
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,600
为什么我们会变成这样
Why are we like this?

419
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:15,280
因为我们是一家人
'Cause we're a family.

420
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,700
家人就是这样的
That's what a family does.

421
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,740
我们只会打架 我已经精疲力尽了
All we ever do is fight, and it's exhausting.

422
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,240
等等
Wait.

423
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,920
你不会把泥巴扔回我脸上呀
You're not gonna throw mud back in my face?

424
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,560
我该怎么办
What do I do?

425
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,430
告诉我 我该怎么办
Tell me, what do I do?

426
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:34,110
随后的一周 我妈和弗吉尼亚・克伦普
For the next week, my mom and Virginia Kremp

427
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,550
都刻意避开对方 但是在一个小镇子里
avoided each other. But in a small town,

428
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,840
你不可能躲着一个人很久
you can only avoid someone for so long.

429
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,180
我知道一定有什么不对劲
I knew something was wrong

430
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:43,780
因为当我咬了一口松饼时
because when I bit into the eclair,

431
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,870
那味道就像是酸奶油和泡菜
it tasted like sour cream and pickles.

432
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,560
如果它们坏了 那就是你的表坏了
If they went bad, they went bad on your watch.

433
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:49,960
我知道你为什么会这么想
I can see why you would think that.

434
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:53,600
通常我不会...绝不会 这样大惊小怪
And normally I would never... Ever, ever make a fuss.

435
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:56,110
但是我买回来这些东西还不到二十四小时
But I did purchase these less than 24 hours ago,

436
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,360
收据还在这儿呢
and I still have the receipt.

437
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:58,850
这些东西不能退
I'm not taking these back!

438
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,040
你开玩笑吗
Are you kidding me?!

439
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:03,290
我妈可能会对弗吉尼亚妥协
My mom may have been able to give up on Virginia,

440
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,670
但是她绝不会背弃自己
but she couldn't give up on who she was.

441
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,670
戈德堡太太
Mrs. Goldberg,

442
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,980
我...我不知道你俩之前认识
I...I didn't know you two knew each other.

443
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,800
废话我们当然认识 我们可是邻居
Damn right we do. We're neighbors.

444
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:13,290
现在... 要么去给她拿些新做的松饼
Now... Go back and get her some fresh eclairs.

445
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,190
要么你就是还想上演...
Or would you like a repeat...

446
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,970
生日蛋糕事件的惨败
of the birthday cake fiasco?

447
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,470
是谁在一个十岁孩子的生日蛋糕上
Who writes "sorry for your loss"

448
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,180
写了"为你们的损失感到抱歉"
on a 10-year-old's birthday cake?

449
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:25,040
- 那只是个小疏忽 而且维克多已经被开除了 - 是啊
- It was a mistake, and Victor was let go. - Yeah.

450
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:27,250
但对这个店来说可是倒霉的日子
Well, that was a dark day for this store.

451
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,800
不过它还有可能更倒霉
But it could get a lot darker.

452
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:30,980
我会处理的
I'll take care of it.

453
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:33,280
抱歉 女士 我会马上解决的
Sorry, ma'am. I'll fix you right up.

454
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,630
我知道我刚才又大声喧哗 引起围观了
I know I just made a big, loud scene.

455
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,790
这就是我的作风
It's just what I do.

456
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,770
开门 开门 亲爱的
Knock, knock. Honey?

457
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,500
你在里面吗
Are you in there?

458
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,820
走开 我不想和你说话
Go away. I don't wanna talk to you.

459
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:57,140
你是对的 我该给你一些空间
You're right. I should give you some space.

460
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,170
最起码把门关上 别开灯
At least close the door, and don't turn on the lights.

461
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,940
黑暗是我唯一的朋友
Darkness is my only friend.

462
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:12,300
亚当 我很抱歉
Adam, I am so sorry.

463
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:14,220
你当然该感到抱歉 看看我现在的样子
You should be sorry! Look at me!

464
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:16,350
我穿着一身夜光弹力紧身衣
I'm in a glow-in-the-dark unitard!

465
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:19,250
查德是它为我带来的唯一的朋友...
And Chad was the only friend that got me...

466
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,710
还有谁能有这个
Who got this!

467
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,740
而你却毁掉了这一切...
And you just had to ruin it...

468
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:25,560
就为了这世上有个人
Just because one person in this world

469
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:26,940
不喜欢你
didn't like you.

470
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,770
亲爱的...
Sweetie...

471
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,900
你对我来说才是最重要的
You're the one that matters.

472
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,330
我宁愿所有人都讨厌我
I'd rather have nobody like me

473
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,640
但我就是不愿看到你永远生我的气
than have you be mad at me forever.

474
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,830
不是永远 只是一个半月
Not forever, just for about a month and a half.

475
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:46,950
好吧...
Well...

476
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,470
让我试试能不能缩短这个时间
Let's see if I can shorten that up just a bit.

477
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,620
嗨
Yo.

478
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:55,230
嗨
Yo.

479
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,330
你在做什么
Whatcha doin'?

480
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,140
没什么
Nothing.

481
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,400
想不想一起拍完我们的电影
Want to finish our movie?

482
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:00,760
想啊 你呢
Yeah. Do you?

483
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:02,480
- 妈的 当然 - 查德 别说脏话
- Hell, yeah. - Chad, "H" word.

484
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:03,740
对不起
Sorry.

485
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,590
太棒了
Cool.

486
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,890
"H"词到底是什么
What the hell's the "H" word?

487
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:17,070
那么 我想明天我们可以一起暴走
So I was thinking tomorrow we could go for a power walk.

488
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,720
然后你可以来我家一起分小松饼吃
And then you could come over and we could split an eclair.

489
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:22,160
或者我现在就可以去
Or I could come over right now,

490
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:24,220
我们就能各吃各的小松饼了
and we could each have our own eclair.

491
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,250
嗯... Beverly Goldeberg 你可真不咋样
Mm... Beverly Goldberg, you are bad.

492
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,750
我是不咋样 我可是最差劲的
I am bad. I am the worst.

493
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,230
就这样吧 走吧
Let's do it. Let's do it.

494
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,420
好的
Okay.

495
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,600
就这样 这世上唯一
And just like that, the one person out there

496
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:37,470
不喜欢我老妈的人成了她最要好的朋友
who didn't like my mom became her best friend.

497
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,860
就连我老爸
Even my dad,

498
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,740
虽然总是以没有朋友自居
who prided himself on having no friends,

499
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:42,960
但也开始有交朋友的念头了
started to come around to the idea.

500
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:45,790
嗨
Yo.

501
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,010
嗨
Yo.

502
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:48,990
干嘛呢
Whatcha doin'?

503
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,460
呃... 没什么
Uh... Nothin'. 

504
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,490
我不知道你是否感兴趣 不过 嗯...
I don't know if you're interested, but, um...

505
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,850
我这有老鹰队的赛季票...
I got eagles season tickets...

506
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,360
在中场
50 yard line.

507
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,050
你礼拜天有空吗
You around Sunday?

508
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,370
当然
Yeah!

509
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,220
看着克伦普家的孩子们和睦相处
Watching the Kremp kids get along

510
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:09,430
激发了巴里和埃里卡去尝试一些新的疯狂的事...
inspired Barry and Erica to try something new and crazy...

511
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:11,200
他们彼此留意对方
Look out for each other.

512
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,220
嘿 查德
Hey, Chad.

513
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,760
你不是想打赌我爬不上你家院子里的树吗
You want to bet I can't climb the tree in your yard?

514
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:15,620
是的
Yeah!

515
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,620
我们彼此学到了很多
We learned a lot from each other.

516
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:25,760
我们教会了他们
We taught them it was okay

517
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:27,160
偶尔抬高嗓音也没什么不可以
to raise your voice now and then.

518
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:28,760
我要的是那种薄如纸片的
I asked for paper-thin.

519
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,060
而你给我的...
You gave me slices...

520
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:32,880
却有我的拇指那么厚... 简直让人无法接受
Thick as my thumb... not acceptable.

521
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:38,390
在他们学着怎样更像戈德堡一家的同时
While they learned how to be more like the Goldbergs,

522
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,790
我们也学着怎样更像克伦普家的人
we learned to be a little more like the Kremps.

523
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,430
埃里卡 有你电话
Erica, telephone.

524
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,720
什么 老妈 按一下那个按钮
What? Push the button, mom.

525
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:47,230
一点都不难
It's not hard.

526
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,380
- 埃里卡 - 我到底要教你多少次怎么用啊
- Erica... - How many times do I have to show you how this works?

527
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,770
这个该死的东西该怎么用呀
How does this stupid thing work?

528
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,930
- 埃里卡 电... - 对着盒子讲话
- Erica, telep... - Talk into the box!

529
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,010
- 埃里卡 电话 - 哈喽
- Erica! Telephone! - Hello?

530
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,500
- 快接那个该死的电话 - 你怎么了 老妈
- Pick up the damn phone! - What's the matter with you? Mom?

531
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:59,820
是的 我们和克伦普家的人不同...
Yep, we were different than the Kremps...

532
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,560
不是更好 也不是更糟...
Not better, not worse...

533
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,110
仅仅是... 不同
Just... Different.

534
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,520
跟你说过了 我能再做到的
Told you I could do it again.

535
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,120
你太愚蠢了 居然怀疑我的能力
You're so stupid for doubting me.

536
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:09,080
哦 虽然巴里不帮我们解决纷争
Oh, though Barry didn't help our case.

537
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:13,730
好的 各位 今天我们要再现
Okay, folks. Today we're re-enacting

538
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,540
"帝国反击战"的一些情景 你准备好了吗
some "Empire Strikes Back." Are you ready?

539
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,280
老兄 你确定要这样吗
Dude, are you sure about this?

540
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:20,560
哦 我确定 继续录制
Oh, I'm sure. Keep it rolling.

541
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,480
发生了什么
What's goin' on?

542
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:34,000
哦 你为什么总是玩这种低级游戏
Oh, why do you always do this crap?

543
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,800
我可是你的父亲
I'm your father!

544
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:38,430
不... 那不是真的
No... That's not true.

545
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,000
