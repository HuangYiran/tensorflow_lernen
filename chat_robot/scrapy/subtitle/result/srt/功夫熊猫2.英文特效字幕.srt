{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Long ago, in ancient China,

3
00:00:24,665 --> 00:00:27,869
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the Peacocks ruled over Gongmen City.

4
00:00:28,669 --> 00:00:32,501
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They brought great joy and prosperity to the city

5
00:00:32,673 --> 00:00:36,007
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for they had invented fireworks.

6
00:00:39,389 --> 00:00:42,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But their son, Lord Shen,

7
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:45,724
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}saw darker power in the fireworks.

8
00:00:46,938 --> 00:00:49,429
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What had brought colour and joy

9
00:00:49,607 --> 00:00:53,984
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}could also bring darkness
and destruction.

10
00:00:54,153 --> 00:00:57,937
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shen's troubled parents
consulted a soothsayer.

11
00:00:58,116 --> 00:01:03,406
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She foretold that if Shen
continued down this dark path,

12
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:08,574
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he would be defeated
by a warrior of black and white.

13
00:01:09,711 --> 00:01:13,329
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The young lord
set out to change his fate.

14
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:18,334
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But what he did next only sealed it.

15
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:27,217
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shen returned to his parents
full of pride.

16
00:01:27,395 --> 00:01:31,523
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But in their faces, he saw only horror.

17
00:01:33,276 --> 00:01:36,111
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was banished from the city forever.

18
00:01:36,279 --> 00:01:39,482
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But Shen swore revenge.

19
00:01:39,657 --> 00:01:42,492
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Someday he would return

20
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:46,528
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and all of China would bow at his feet.

21
00:02:17,987 --> 00:02:20,905
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's almost done, Lord Shen,
but we've run out of metal.

22
00:02:22,492 --> 00:02:26,988
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Search the farthest villages!
Find more metal!

23
00:02:27,163 --> 00:02:29,037
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}China will be mine.

24
00:02:39,175 --> 00:02:42,378
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then the Dragon Warrior
joined the Furious Five!

25
00:02:42,553 --> 00:02:45,424
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And they became the most
awesomest kung fu team ever!

26
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:47,425
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Enough talk. Let's fight!

27
00:02:48,685 --> 00:02:49,764
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- 33...
- Thirty-three...
- Listen, listen!

28
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:52,261
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can hear the Dragon Warrior
training right now!

29
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:53,849
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thirty-three. Stop him!

30
00:02:54,023 --> 00:02:55,268
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Thirty-four.
- It's too dangerous!

31
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:57,767
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Thirty-five. Stay focused.
- Thirty-six!

32
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:59,604
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Thirty-seven!
- Yeah!

33
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:02,235
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How is he doing that with his face?

34
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:08,573
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thirty-eight bean buns!

35
00:03:08,746 --> 00:03:11,284
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes! New record! You monster!

36
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:13,746
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Keep going! Hit 40!
- He'll never hit 40.

37
00:03:13,918 --> 00:03:16,124
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You guys wait and we'll go to 40.

38
00:03:16,295 --> 00:03:17,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do it.

39
00:03:17,588 --> 00:03:18,999
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No problem!

40
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:23,753
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah!

41
00:03:24,887 --> 00:03:26,298
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give me a minute.

42
00:03:27,557 --> 00:03:28,968
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah!

43
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:32,182
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He did it!
- Well done, Po!

44
00:03:33,771 --> 00:03:35,182
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your training has paid off.

45
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:38,558
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Master Shifu!
Gotta go. See you later!

46
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll save those for me, right?

47
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:51,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Flippety-do.

48
00:04:02,133 --> 00:04:03,711
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Inner peace.

49
00:04:06,721 --> 00:04:09,212
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Inner peace.

50
00:04:12,477 --> 00:04:14,303
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Inner peace.

51
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:15,889
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Master Shifu.

53
00:04:18,941 --> 00:04:21,859
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pirates? Vandals of Volcano Mountain?

54
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:26,073
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whatever it is, I will take them down.
'Cause I am in a mood.

55
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,648
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need to get something done,
you know what I mean?

56
00:04:30,578 --> 00:04:31,823
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing?

57
00:04:31,996 --> 00:04:35,412
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One of Master Oogway's final teachings.

58
00:05:06,656 --> 00:05:07,687
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Awesome!

59
00:05:07,865 --> 00:05:10,783
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How did you do that?

60
00:05:10,952 --> 00:05:14,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Inner peace.
- Inner piece. That's cool.

61
00:05:15,873 --> 00:05:19,456
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Inner piece of what?
- It is the next phase of your training.

62
00:05:19,627 --> 00:05:25,463
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Every master must find his path
to inner peace.

63
00:05:25,633 --> 00:05:29,797
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some choose to meditate for 50 years
in a cave just like this...

64
00:05:31,848 --> 00:05:34,967
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...without the slightest taste
of food or water.

65
00:05:36,728 --> 00:05:37,807
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or?

66
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:41,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some find it through
pain and suffering, as I did.

67
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:44,976
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Po, the day you were chosen
as Dragon Warrior

68
00:05:45,153 --> 00:05:46,979
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}was the worst day of my life.

69
00:05:47,864 --> 00:05:50,402
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}By far.
Nothing else came close.

70
00:05:50,575 --> 00:05:54,952
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was the worst, most painful,
mind-destroying, horrible moment...

71
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:57,577
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- OK.
...I have ever experienced.

72
00:06:01,586 --> 00:06:05,666
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But once I realised the problem
was not you, but within me,

73
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:11,427
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I found inner peace and was able
to harness the flow of the universe.

74
00:06:11,596 --> 00:06:14,134
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So that's it? I just need inner peace?

75
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My innards are
already super, super peaceful,

76
00:06:16,601 --> 00:06:20,017
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so all I need to do
is just get this thing going.

77
00:06:20,188 --> 00:06:22,145
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Inner peace, you're going down.

78
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,106
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now show me what you were
doing there with your feet.

79
00:06:24,275 --> 00:06:25,354
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I saw you do sort of a fancy foot...

80
00:06:25,526 --> 00:06:28,527
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Po! Bandits!
Approaching the Musicians Village.

81
00:06:28,696 --> 00:06:29,775
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Danger.

82
00:06:29,947 --> 00:06:33,862
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell those musicians to start playing
some action music because it is on.

83
00:06:34,035 --> 00:06:36,407
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry, Shifu, I'll master
inner peace as soon as I get back.

84
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:38,204
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No snack stops this time.

85
00:06:39,207 --> 00:06:41,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Snack stops.

86
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,958
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait, are you serious?

87
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,591
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get all the metal you can find!

88
00:07:01,646 --> 00:07:02,926
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grab the metal!

89
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:10,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Help, help, help, help. Help!

90
00:07:13,991 --> 00:07:16,233
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's everything!
Let's get out of here.

91
00:07:17,412 --> 00:07:18,526
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no.

92
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:25,869
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wings of Justice!

93
00:07:44,856 --> 00:07:46,054
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Dragon Warrior!

94
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:48,521
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A panda? That's impossible.

95
00:07:48,693 --> 00:07:50,602
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My fist hungers for justice.

96
00:07:51,821 --> 00:07:53,481
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was my... fist.

97
00:07:53,656 --> 00:07:55,981
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Get 'em!
- Come on!

98
00:08:19,223 --> 00:08:20,552
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take that!

99
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:32,568
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Po! Incoming!

100

103
00:09:09,232 --> 00:09:11,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tigress! Monkey!

104
00:09:11,693 --> 00:09:13,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Viper! Mantis!

105
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,646
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bunny! What?

106
00:09:16,531 --> 00:09:17,645
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, sorry.

107
00:09:23,705 --> 00:09:24,736
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Help!

108
00:09:25,873 --> 00:09:27,831
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Crane, go!
- I'm on it!

109
00:09:46,978 --> 00:09:48,555
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is everyone OK?

110
00:09:49,105 --> 00:09:51,144
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was awesome!

111
00:09:53,901 --> 00:09:54,933
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got this.

112
00:10:06,247 --> 00:10:07,528
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Po!

113
00:10:13,796 --> 00:10:15,338
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chew on that, tubby!

114
00:10:21,471 --> 00:10:22,846
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Help.

115
00:10:24,932 --> 00:10:27,258
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Sweetie, are you OK?
- What happened?

116
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:30,603
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think I saw...

117
00:10:30,772 --> 00:10:33,097
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think...

118
00:10:33,274 --> 00:10:34,685
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I gotta go.

119
00:10:37,028 --> 00:10:42,271
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you. Thank you for coming
to Dragon Warrior Noodles and Tofu.

120
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,193
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- More tea? Lemon sauce?
- No.

121
00:10:44,369 --> 00:10:47,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you need anything, just ask.

122
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:50,993
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Thank you.
- Feet of Fury!

123
00:10:51,167 --> 00:10:55,628
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Dragon Warrior's mop.
He mopped these very floors!

124
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:59,126
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No touching!
You'll get the mop dirty.

125
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,633
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He once waited on me.
- Awesome!

126
00:11:01,803 --> 00:11:05,717
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I have the stain to prove it.
Hey, where is the Dragon Warrior?

127
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:08,215
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He doesn't work here any more.

128
00:11:08,393 --> 00:11:11,892
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's busy out there
protecting the Valley.

129
00:11:12,063 --> 00:11:13,557
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- The Dragon Warrior!
- There he is.

130
00:11:13,731 --> 00:11:14,762
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Po!

131
00:11:16,901 --> 00:11:19,392
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Here. OK. Nice kid.
- The Dragon Warrior!

132
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:21,812
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Should've told me you were coming.
- Hi, Dad.

133
00:11:21,989 --> 00:11:24,231
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I would have saved you
some stinky tofu.

134
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:28,911
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Dad, can I talk to you?
- Of course, son.

135
00:11:29,664 --> 00:11:35,251
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In honour of my son,
free tofu dessert for everybody!

136
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,293
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With purchases.

137
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:41,081
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, it's so good to see you, Po.

138
00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:44,877
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have you lost weight? I can
almost put my wings around you.

139
00:11:45,054 --> 00:11:46,714
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah, well, maybe a little.

140
00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:50,721
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Poor you, you must feel weak.
Let me get you some soup.

141
00:11:50,893 --> 00:11:52,471
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, that's OK, Dad.
I'm not hungry.

142
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:55,314
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not hungry?
Po, are you all right?

143
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:57,438
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. No, I'm fine. I just...

144
00:11:57,608 --> 00:11:59,934
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Earlier today,
I was fighting these bandits.

145
00:12:00,111 --> 00:12:03,361
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing too dangerous.
I mean, they were just, you know...

146
00:12:03,531 --> 00:12:06,485
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah?
- And then the strangest thing happened.

147
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,367
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I had this crazy vision.

148
00:12:08,536 --> 00:12:12,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think I saw my mom and me,
as a baby.

149
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:15,121
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom? A baby?

150
00:12:15,293 --> 00:12:18,662
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Dad?
- What...?

151
00:12:19,797 --> 00:12:21,837
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do I say this?

152
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:25,335
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where did I come from?

153
00:12:29,223 --> 00:12:35,013
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, you see, son,
baby geese come from a little egg.

154
00:12:35,396 --> 00:12:39,857
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Don't ask where the egg comes from.
- Dad, that's not what I meant.

155
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:43,233
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know it's not.

156
00:12:43,404 --> 00:12:48,695
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think it's time I told you something
I should have told you a long time ago.

157
00:12:49,494 --> 00:12:50,656
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK.

158
00:12:50,828 --> 00:12:54,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You might have been kind of a...

159
00:12:58,169 --> 00:12:59,829
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...adopted.

160
00:13:00,004 --> 00:13:01,831
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I knew it.
- You knew?

161
00:13:02,006 --> 00:13:04,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Well, who told you?
- No one. I mean, come on, Dad.

162
00:13:05,134 --> 00:13:07,969
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But if you knew,
why didn't you ever say anything?

163
00:13:08,137 --> 00:13:10,011
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why didn't you say anything?

164
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:15,019
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How did I get here, Dad?
Where did I come from?

165
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:20,181
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Actually... you came from this.

166
00:13:24,112 --> 00:13:26,947
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was just another day
at the restaurant.

167
00:13:27,115 --> 00:13:28,739
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Time to make the noodles.

168
00:13:29,534 --> 00:13:34,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I went out to the back, where my
vegetables had just been delivered.

169
00:13:34,205 --> 00:13:36,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There were cabbages, turnips, radishes.

170
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:40,705
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Only there were no radishes.

171
00:13:40,878 --> 00:13:44,294
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just a very hungry baby panda.

172
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,878
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There was no note.

173
00:13:49,053 --> 00:13:51,093
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course, you could have eaten it.

174
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:56,258
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I waited for someone to come
looking for you, but no one did.

175
00:14:20,251 --> 00:14:22,244
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I brought you inside.

176
00:14:24,505 --> 00:14:26,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fed you.

177
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,294
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gave you a bath.

178
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:34,297
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And fed you again.

179
00:14:36,768 --> 00:14:38,392
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And again.

180
00:14:40,605 --> 00:14:43,274
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And tried to put some pants on you.

181
00:14:51,866 --> 00:14:55,816
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then I made a decision
that would change my life forever.

182
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:01,117
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To make my soup without radishes.

183
00:15:01,292 --> 00:15:05,539
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And to raise you as my own son.

184
00:15:05,713 --> 00:15:09,925
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Xiao Po, my little panda.

185
00:15:11,135 --> 00:15:15,465
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And from that moment on,
both my soup and my life

186
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,798
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}have been that much sweeter.

187
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:21,971
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, little Po,
that's the end of the story.

188
00:15:23,314 --> 00:15:26,315
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at me. No, don't look at me.

189
00:15:26,484 --> 00:15:30,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's it? That can't be it.
There's gotta be more, Dad!

190
00:15:31,155 --> 00:15:35,367
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, there was the time
you ate all my bamboo furniture.

191
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:37,527
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was imported, too.

192
00:15:38,121 --> 00:15:40,872
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One dumpling, please,
Dragon Warrior size.

193
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:50,079
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Po, your story may not
have such a happy beginning,

194
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:51,758
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but look how it turned out.

195
00:15:51,926 --> 00:15:55,675
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got me, you got kung fu,
and you got noodles.

196
00:15:55,847 --> 00:15:58,516
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know. I just have so many questions.

197
00:15:58,683 --> 00:16:01,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like how did I ever fit
in this tiny basket?

198
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:02,929
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why didn't I like pants?

199
00:16:05,273 --> 00:16:07,265
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And who am I?

200
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:16,364
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good. Watch your form.

201
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:20,537
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good.

202
00:16:22,123 --> 00:16:24,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Better. Elbow.

203
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:27,077
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Straighten it out!

204
00:16:52,862 --> 00:16:55,068
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shen?

205
00:16:55,239 --> 00:16:58,193
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good afternoon, gentlemen.

206
00:16:58,368 --> 00:17:03,113
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now we've got the pleasantries
out of the way, please leave my house.

207
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:05,412
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Your house?
- Yes.

208
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:08,074
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Didn't you see the peacock
on the front door?

209
00:17:10,046 --> 00:17:12,204
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There you are, Soothsayer.

210
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:17,544
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It seems your fortune-telling skills
are not as good as you thought.

211
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,718
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We shall see, Shen.
- No, you shall see, old goat.

212
00:17:21,891 --> 00:17:24,429
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Where were we?
- What do you want, Shen?

213
00:17:24,602 --> 00:17:29,098
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is rightfully mine. Gongmen City!

214
00:17:29,273 --> 00:17:31,943
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gongmen is under the stewardship
of the Masters' Council,

215
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:35,942
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and we will protect it. Even from you.

216
00:17:37,115 --> 00:17:40,365
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm so glad you feel that way.

217
00:17:40,535 --> 00:17:43,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Otherwise, I'd have dragged
that here for nothing.

218
00:17:43,538 --> 00:17:45,577
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's in the box, Shen?

219
00:17:45,748 --> 00:17:49,283
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want to see? It's a gift.

220
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:53,244
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's your parting gift,
in that it will part you.

221
00:17:53,423 --> 00:17:54,965
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Part of you here, part of you there

222
00:17:55,133 --> 00:17:59,082
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and part of you way over there,
staining the wall!

223
00:17:59,262 --> 00:18:01,254
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You insolent fool!

224
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:21,777
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Show-off.
- That is a warning.

225
00:18:21,951 --> 00:18:24,786
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are no match for our kung fu.

226
00:18:24,954 --> 00:18:26,911
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I agree.

227
00:18:27,081 --> 00:18:28,789
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But this is.

228
00:18:42,764 --> 00:18:45,515
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you familiar
with the master of Gongmen City?

229
00:18:45,683 --> 00:18:47,012
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Master Thundering Rhino?
- Yes.

230
00:18:47,185 --> 00:18:49,758
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Son of legendary Flying Rhino?
- Yes.

231
00:18:49,937 --> 00:18:52,891
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And slayer of the Ten Thousand
Serpents in the Valley of Woe?

232
00:18:53,066 --> 00:18:55,105
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He's dead.
- Whoa.

233
00:18:55,276 --> 00:18:56,474
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's impossible.

234
00:18:56,652 --> 00:18:59,108
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rhino's Horn Defence
is impervious to any technique.

235
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,779
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was no technique.
Lord Shen has created a weapon,

236
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:05,358
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}one that breathes fire and spits metal.

237
00:19:05,995 --> 00:19:10,871
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Unless he is stopped,
this could be the end of kung fu.

238
00:19:11,542 --> 00:19:15,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- But I just got kung fu!
- And now you must save it.

239
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:19,502
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go! Destroy this weapon
and bring Lord Shen to justice!

240
00:19:19,676 --> 00:19:21,502
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK, here we go! Here we go!

241
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:25,383
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait a second.
How can I do this?

242
00:19:25,556 --> 00:19:28,178
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, how can kung fu stop
something that stops kung fu?

243
00:19:28,351 --> 00:19:30,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember, Dragon Warrior,

244
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:33,805
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}anything is possible
when you have inner peace.

245
00:19:39,529 --> 00:19:42,233
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Inner peace. Inner peace. Inner peace.

246
00:19:43,074 --> 00:19:44,153
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Peace on.

247
00:19:44,325 --> 00:19:46,365
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh, Po?
- Peace!

248
00:19:46,536 --> 00:19:48,659
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Po, I got you a travel pack.

249
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:51,914
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I packed you food for weeks.
Cookies, buns, vegetables.

250
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:55,333
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I even packed
all your action figures. See?

251
00:19:58,423 --> 00:20:01,708
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know what those are.
Never seen them before in my life.

252
00:20:01,884 --> 00:20:03,758
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad, you got scratches on my Tigress.

253
00:20:03,928 --> 00:20:06,799
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I also packed your paintings
of our best time together,

254
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:09,511
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}just in case you get lonely.

255
00:20:09,684 --> 00:20:13,516
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's me and you making noodles.
And that's me and you eating noodles.

256
00:20:13,688 --> 00:20:16,095
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that's me giving you
a piggyback ride.

257
00:20:17,567 --> 00:20:20,521
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That cute? On second thought,
I'll hang on to this one.

258
00:20:20,695 --> 00:20:24,562
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hey, they're waiting for me.
- Of course, of course.

259
00:20:24,741 --> 00:20:27,907
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have a job to do... far from home,

260
00:20:28,077 --> 00:20:31,778
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in a strange city, filled with
strange people, and strange noodles,

261
00:20:31,956 --> 00:20:35,705
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}facing horrible danger
from which you might never return!

262
00:20:35,877 --> 00:20:38,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Don't go, Po!
- I gotta go.

263
00:20:38,629 --> 00:20:41,915
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm the Dragon Warrior.
It's kind of my job to save kung fu.

264
00:20:42,091 --> 00:20:45,045
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And if I don't... what am I?

265
00:20:45,219 --> 00:20:47,675
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're my son.

266
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,464
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right?

267
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:55,895
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Po, it's time.
- Goodbye.

268
00:20:57,982 --> 00:20:59,393
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry, Mr. Ping.

269
00:20:59,567 --> 00:21:01,939
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He'll be back before
you can say "noodles".

270
00:21:07,658 --> 00:21:09,651
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Noodles.

271
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:17,917
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, guys, let's go!

272
00:21:18,086 --> 00:21:19,284
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah!

273
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,667
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah...

274
00:21:23,841 --> 00:21:26,593
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, yeah. Yeah...

275
00:22:46,174 --> 00:22:47,419
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mama?

276
00:22:52,889 --> 00:22:55,724
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom? Dad? Is that you?

277
00:22:55,892 --> 00:22:58,217
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom! Dad!

278
00:23:00,104 --> 00:23:02,476
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, hi. Hey, son. You're back.

279
00:23:04,108 --> 00:23:05,935
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honey, what are you doing here?

280
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,142
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I thought...

281
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,237
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We replaced you, dear,
with this lovely radish.

282
00:23:11,324 --> 00:23:14,444
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Radish?
- It's quiet, polite, and, frankly,

283
00:23:14,619 --> 00:23:16,493
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}does better kung fu.

284
00:23:17,163 --> 00:23:18,871
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. No, no, no.

285
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:23,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait!

286
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:31,207
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

287
00:23:39,769 --> 00:23:42,438
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Radish, radish, radish, radish.

288
00:23:50,988 --> 00:23:52,815
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Inner pea...

289
00:23:55,618 --> 00:23:56,697
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pea...

290
00:23:59,163 --> 00:24:00,741
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Inner peace.

291
00:24:17,098 --> 00:24:21,926
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Inner peace! Inner peace! Inner peace!
Inner peace! Inner peace...!

292
00:24:27,859 --> 00:24:29,851
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm... training.

293
00:24:30,028 --> 00:24:32,316
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The mast is not a worthy opponent.

294
00:24:36,034 --> 00:24:38,359
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I am ready.
- OK.

295
00:24:38,536 --> 00:24:40,529
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So serious.

296
00:24:48,254 --> 00:24:50,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think I prefer the mast.

297
00:24:50,506 --> 00:24:55,215
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Apologies. I used to punch the
ironwood trees by the palace to train.

298
00:24:55,386 --> 00:24:56,715
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now I feel nothing.

299
00:24:57,722 --> 00:24:59,761
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's severely cool.

300
00:25:02,685 --> 00:25:03,716
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Again!

301
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:10,643
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, this punching ironwood trees,
how long did you have to do that?

302
00:25:10,818 --> 00:25:13,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Twenty years.
- Oh, 20, 20 years.

303
00:25:14,489 --> 00:25:16,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is there any, you know, faster way?

304
00:25:16,908 --> 00:25:19,613
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, until you, you know,
don't feel anything?

305
00:25:19,786 --> 00:25:21,743
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Besides...

306
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:28,751
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...I don't think
hard style is your thing.

307
00:25:33,257 --> 00:25:35,879
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Po, why are you really out here?

308
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:40,589
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just found out that my dad
isn't really my dad.

309
00:25:42,684 --> 00:25:44,475
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your dad? The goose.

310
00:25:47,105 --> 00:25:49,346
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That must have been quite a shock.

311
00:25:49,524 --> 00:25:50,899
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

312
00:25:51,067 --> 00:25:54,436
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- And this bothers you?
- Are you kidding me?

313
00:25:54,612 --> 00:25:57,613
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're warriors, right?
Nerves of steel.

314
00:25:57,782 --> 00:25:59,739
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Souls of platinum.

315
00:25:59,909 --> 00:26:01,107
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like you.

316
00:26:01,285 --> 00:26:03,243
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So hard-core, you don't feel anything.

317
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:09,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I was...
- So, what are you guys talking about?

318
00:26:10,712 --> 00:26:12,455
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing. Nothing.

319
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:14,753
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Po's having daddy issues.

320
00:26:14,924 --> 00:26:18,044
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm so lucky.
I don't have any problems with my dad.

321
00:26:18,219 --> 00:26:20,591
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe it's because Mom
ate his head before I was born.

322
00:26:20,763 --> 00:26:23,598
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I don't know.
- Mantis, this isn't about you.

323
00:26:23,766 --> 00:26:25,806
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Po is the one freaking out.

324
00:26:25,977 --> 00:26:28,135
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm not freaking out.
- Po.

325
00:26:28,312 --> 00:26:30,519
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm freaking in.
- Po!

326
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:33,359
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What?
- We're here.

327
00:26:33,526 --> 00:26:35,483
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gongmen City.

328
00:26:51,836 --> 00:26:54,374
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My father's throne.

329
00:26:54,547 --> 00:26:57,583
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He used to let me play here beside him,

330
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:02,255
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}promising someday,
this throne would be mine.

331
00:27:07,101 --> 00:27:08,382
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A little to the left.

332
00:27:08,561 --> 00:27:10,684
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, but it's so heavy, Master!

333
00:27:10,855 --> 00:27:14,141
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thirty years I've waited
for this moment.

334
00:27:14,317 --> 00:27:17,816
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everything must be exactly
how I envisioned it.

335
00:27:17,987 --> 00:27:21,688
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I envisioned it
a little to the left.

336
00:27:22,617 --> 00:27:23,897
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perfect!

337
00:27:24,077 --> 00:27:27,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With the weapon by my si...
A little bit more.

338
00:27:29,457 --> 00:27:35,211
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With the weapon by my side,
all of China will bow before me.

339
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We move out in three days,

340
00:27:37,215 --> 00:27:41,047
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when the moon is full
and the tide is high.

341
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, you old goat,
why don't you tell me my...

342
00:27:46,015 --> 00:27:47,046
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fortune?

343
00:27:47,934 --> 00:27:50,935
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Future. I was going to say future.

344
00:27:51,896 --> 00:27:55,479
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look into your bowl
and tell me what glory awaits.

345
00:27:57,193 --> 00:28:00,728
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you continue on your current path...

346
00:28:03,074 --> 00:28:07,072
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...you will find yourself
at the bottom of the stairs.

347
00:28:09,706 --> 00:28:11,579
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I see...

348
00:28:12,375 --> 00:28:14,367
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I see...

349
00:28:15,128 --> 00:28:18,579
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I see pain... and anger.

350
00:28:18,756 --> 00:28:21,757
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How dare you!
That is the finest silk in the province!

351
00:28:21,926 --> 00:28:22,957
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Followed by denial.

352
00:28:23,136 --> 00:28:25,757
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is not fortune-telling.
You're just saying

353
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:27,923
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- what's happening right...
- Now?

354
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The most important time is now.

355
00:28:33,521 --> 00:28:35,929
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But if you really want
to see the future...

356
00:28:38,818 --> 00:28:40,478
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, what do you see?

357
00:28:46,409 --> 00:28:48,236
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A peacock...

358
00:28:49,537 --> 00:28:53,617
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...is defeated by a warrior
of black and white.

359
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:56,827
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing has changed.

360
00:29:03,384 --> 00:29:05,922
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's impossible, and you know it.

361
00:29:06,095 --> 00:29:09,298
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is not impossible, and he knows it.

362
00:29:09,474 --> 00:29:10,754
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who?

363
00:29:10,933 --> 00:29:13,934
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Lord Shen! I saw a panda!
- A panda?

364
00:29:16,189 --> 00:29:18,477
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A kung fu warrior.
It fought like a demon!

365
00:29:18,649 --> 00:29:20,274
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Big and furry.

366
00:29:20,443 --> 00:29:23,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Soft and squishy.
Kind of plush and cuddly.

367
00:29:24,197 --> 00:29:27,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There are no more pandas.

368
00:29:27,575 --> 00:29:30,909
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Even with his poor eyesight,
he can see the truth.

369
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:33,949
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why is it that you cannot?

370
00:29:34,874 --> 00:29:37,994
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Find this panda and bring him to me!

371
00:29:38,169 --> 00:29:39,912
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, sir!

372
00:29:40,088 --> 00:29:43,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One panda lives.
That does not make you right.

373
00:29:44,092 --> 00:29:47,924
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're right.
Being right makes me right.

374
00:29:48,513 --> 00:29:52,462
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then I will kill him and make you wrong.

375
00:29:54,477 --> 00:29:56,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will you stop that!

376
00:30:08,658 --> 00:30:11,742
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That must be Shen's palace
on the other side of the city.

377
00:30:11,911 --> 00:30:14,449
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great. We'll march into the tower
and proclaim,

378
00:30:14,622 --> 00:30:16,662
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"We are the Dragon Warrior
and the Furious Five,

379
00:30:16,833 --> 00:30:18,825
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and we are here
to bring you to justice"!

380
00:30:22,088 --> 00:30:24,923
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing?
This place is crawling with wolves.

381
00:30:30,513 --> 00:30:33,004
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, isn't that the guy
who hammered you in the face?

382
00:30:36,477 --> 00:30:38,055
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I do not like that guy.

383
00:30:38,229 --> 00:30:41,847
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We need to get to that tower
without being spotted by those wolves.

384
00:30:42,025 --> 00:30:44,516
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Got it. Stealth mode.

385
00:31:07,967 --> 00:31:10,173
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Get out of the way!
- Foiled again.

386
00:31:12,221 --> 00:31:14,013
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, where'd those noodles go?

387
00:31:20,271 --> 00:31:22,347
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello. I couldn't help but...

388
00:31:23,149 --> 00:31:25,438
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, OK. Anyway, where was I?

389
00:31:26,402 --> 00:31:28,609
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Where's Po?
- How can we lose a guy that big?

390
00:31:32,492 --> 00:31:33,523
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK.

391
00:31:40,124 --> 00:31:42,033
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guys! Guys?

392
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:43,918
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hey, Po.
- What? Sorry.

393
00:31:44,087 --> 00:31:45,581
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So that was stealth mode, huh?

394
00:31:45,755 --> 00:31:48,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To be honest,
not one of my stronger modes.

395
00:31:48,383 --> 00:31:50,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...gold in there, come on!

396
00:31:52,136 --> 00:31:53,417
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This rice is raw!

397
00:31:53,596 --> 00:31:56,134
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You stole all my metal pots
for Lord Shen!

398
00:31:56,307 --> 00:31:59,474
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Either you cook my rice, or I cook you!

399
00:31:59,644 --> 00:32:02,396
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- My apologies, but...
- Po, do something.

400
00:32:02,563 --> 00:32:05,054
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How am I supposed to help her cook rice
without getting caught?

401
00:32:05,233 --> 00:32:07,272
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Wait, I have a better idea.
...two...

402
00:32:07,443 --> 00:32:08,641
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...one.

403
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,444
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hey.
- Hey.

404
00:32:21,749 --> 00:32:24,157
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're here to liberate the city
and bring Shen to justice.

405
00:32:24,335 --> 00:32:26,043
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You will need help.
- Thank you, brave sheep,

406
00:32:26,212 --> 00:32:27,671
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but it's too dangerous. I can't let you.

407
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:31,005
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no, not me.
It's not safe to speak here.

408
00:32:31,175 --> 00:32:32,634
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right.

409
00:32:35,013 --> 00:32:37,504
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm talking about Masters Ox and Croc.

410
00:32:37,682 --> 00:32:41,051
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're in Gongmen Jail
on Black Dragon Alley.

411
00:32:41,227 --> 00:32:42,852
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? They're still alive?

412
00:32:43,021 --> 00:32:45,013
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They must be in that jail
gathering intelligence,

413
00:32:45,189 --> 00:32:47,894
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}hatching a plot to use their
awesomeness to defeat the weapon!

414
00:32:48,067 --> 00:32:49,727
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK, let's go!

415
00:32:49,902 --> 00:32:52,987
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Thanks, sheep.
- Hey! Stop that costume!

416
00:32:53,156 --> 00:32:54,436
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hold it right there!
- Get them!

417
00:32:55,116 --> 00:32:56,859
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Get them!
- Sorry!

418
00:32:57,702 --> 00:32:59,196
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take that!

419
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:00,948
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Keep going!
- Faster!

420
00:33:01,998 --> 00:33:03,029
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, stop!

421
00:33:23,227 --> 00:33:25,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Look out! Watch it!
- Sorry!

422
00:33:25,396 --> 00:33:26,475
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Surround him.

423
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,394
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now!

424
00:33:30,568 --> 00:33:32,311
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gotcha!

425
00:33:33,363 --> 00:33:34,608
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? Where'd he go?

426
00:33:34,781 --> 00:33:37,568
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Spread out! Search everywhere!
- What about over there?

427
00:33:37,742 --> 00:33:41,692
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Is "there" a part of "everywhere"?
- I... I guess.

428
00:33:41,871 --> 00:33:43,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then search there!

429
00:33:48,336 --> 00:33:51,752
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They must be close. I can feel
a kung fu chill riding up my spine.

430
00:33:51,923 --> 00:33:53,915
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, Po. It's just me.

431
00:33:55,093 --> 00:33:57,085
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look. Gongmen Jail.

432
00:34:00,723 --> 00:34:02,515
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aw, it's cute.

433
00:34:03,601 --> 00:34:04,976
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cute, huh?

434
00:34:14,237 --> 00:34:15,814
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nice work, Po.

435
00:34:17,281 --> 00:34:19,903
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At the first sign of trouble,
I'll give you a signal.

436
00:34:21,452 --> 00:34:23,244
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You mean like Crane does?
- Yeah.

437
00:34:23,413 --> 00:34:25,785
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me,
when have I ever made that noise?

438
00:34:26,624 --> 00:34:28,913
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Master Ox! Master!

439
00:34:31,212 --> 00:34:32,623
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The ferocious Master Croc!

440
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:36,963
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And Master Storming Ox.

441
00:34:38,011 --> 00:34:40,798
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't believe we're rescuing
actual legends of kung fu.

442
00:34:40,972 --> 00:34:42,964
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're gonna free you from those
bonds of injustice. No problem.

443
00:34:43,141 --> 00:34:45,762
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gotta be a key around here. No,
they wouldn't leave a key around here.

444
00:34:47,186 --> 00:34:50,021
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, good! You found it.
Come on, you guys! Yeah!

445
00:34:50,189 --> 00:34:52,182
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're coming for you, Shen!

446
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:00,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guys, are we going or not?
Do you want to meet us there later?

447
00:35:01,075 --> 00:35:02,819
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, you do want to
take back your city, right?

448
00:35:02,994 --> 00:35:04,702
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course we do.

449
00:35:04,871 --> 00:35:08,703
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But if we stand up to Shen,
he will turn the weapon on the city.

450
00:35:08,875 --> 00:35:10,666
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen to yourself.
You're protecting Gongmen City

451
00:35:10,835 --> 00:35:12,626
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}by not protecting Gongmen City?

452
00:35:12,795 --> 00:35:17,422
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- If we all fight together...
- Then the weapon would kill everyone.

453
00:35:17,592 --> 00:35:21,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, would it?
Then we use... a sneak attack!

454
00:35:21,512 --> 00:35:24,086
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We get inside and then...
- And then you will be stopped...

455
00:35:27,185 --> 00:35:28,845
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...by the unstoppable weapon.

456
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:31,345
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing's unstoppable except for me
when I'm stopping you

457
00:35:31,522 --> 00:35:34,013
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}from telling me
something's unstoppable!

458
00:35:44,494 --> 00:35:47,245
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Master Ox,
I'm not letting you stay in this cell.

459
00:35:47,413 --> 00:35:49,287
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd like to see you get me out!

460
00:35:54,879 --> 00:35:57,251
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You guys see that?
It's called being awesome.

461
00:35:57,423 --> 00:35:59,297
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on! Whatever
happened to being heroes?

462
00:35:59,467 --> 00:36:02,219
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The only hero in this town
is a dead one!

463
00:36:06,808 --> 00:36:10,508
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like I said, you are not
getting me out of this cell!

464
00:36:13,272 --> 00:36:14,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes!

465
00:36:15,149 --> 00:36:17,142
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, let's go!

466
00:36:17,985 --> 00:36:19,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I get the top bunk.

467
00:36:21,406 --> 00:36:25,569
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's time to surrender, panda.
Kung fu is dead.

468
00:36:25,743 --> 00:36:27,237
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I...

469
00:36:30,373 --> 00:36:31,452
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You...

470
00:36:31,624 --> 00:36:34,791
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kung fu is dead? Fine!

471
00:36:34,961 --> 00:36:38,412
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You stay in your prison of fear
with bars made of hopelessness.

472
00:36:38,589 --> 00:36:41,793
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And all you get are three
square meals a day of shame!

473
00:36:41,968 --> 00:36:43,592
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With despair for dessert.

474
00:36:43,761 --> 00:36:46,928
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll take on Shen and prove
to all those who are hungry

475
00:36:47,098 --> 00:36:51,012
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for justice and honour
that kung fu still lives!

476
00:36:51,185 --> 00:36:52,561
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah!

477
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:56,805
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Monkey?!

478
00:36:58,359 --> 00:36:59,688
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You! You're mine!

479
00:36:59,861 --> 00:37:01,818
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll tell you what's gonna be yours!

480
00:37:01,988 --> 00:37:04,905
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My fist in your plush, cuddly,
super-soft face!

481
00:37:07,535 --> 00:37:08,946
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get him!

482
00:37:09,495 --> 00:37:11,203
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Get me out of here!
- Yes, sir!

483
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,415
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop him!

484
00:37:16,419 --> 00:37:17,699
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Faster!

485
00:37:20,798 --> 00:37:23,289
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah! Go, go!

486
00:37:23,926 --> 00:37:25,966
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Lose him!
- Yes, sir!

487
00:37:27,972 --> 00:37:29,965
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Viper!
- Hang on!

488
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,152
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What?
- Watch out!

489
00:37:44,739 --> 00:37:46,815
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uncool! Very uncool!

490
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,908
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Try this!

491
00:37:50,161 --> 00:37:51,324
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guys, guys, guys!

492
00:37:56,584 --> 00:37:58,162
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe something smaller!

493
00:37:58,711 --> 00:38:00,834
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no! Oh, no, no.

494
00:38:05,385 --> 00:38:08,136
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cute bunnies, off the face.
Excuse me! OK, pardon me!

495
00:38:17,772 --> 00:38:19,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fire!

496
00:38:20,149 --> 00:38:21,691
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've lost them.

497
00:38:30,702 --> 00:38:32,659
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Again! Again!

498
00:38:33,788 --> 00:38:35,033
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Crane, catch!

499
00:38:38,501 --> 00:38:39,532
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gotcha!

500
00:38:48,845 --> 00:38:50,837
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guys, guys, guys, guys,
give me a shove!

501
00:38:51,597 --> 00:38:53,555
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mantis, now!

502
00:39:06,988 --> 00:39:10,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that all you got? It feels like
I'm fighting a big old fluffy cloud!

503
00:39:10,992 --> 00:39:13,234
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, this cloud is about
to bring the thunder!

504
00:39:16,456 --> 00:39:17,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your turn!

505
00:39:19,709 --> 00:39:23,244
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why... are... there...
so... many... signs?!

506
00:39:39,062 --> 00:39:41,387
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come here! Alaka-squasho!

507
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:46,059
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes! Taste the defeat!

508
00:39:46,235 --> 00:39:47,611
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me tell you something.

509
00:39:47,779 --> 00:39:50,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Next time you mess with a panda,
you better bring a whole a...

510
00:40:00,583 --> 00:40:02,374
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guess nobody told you,

511
00:40:02,543 --> 00:40:05,461
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if you mess with the wolf,
you get the fangs.

512
00:40:05,963 --> 00:40:09,831
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've hit you twice.
What are you going to do now?

513
00:40:12,762 --> 00:40:14,671
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We surrender!

514
00:40:18,226 --> 00:40:22,437
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can chain my body, but you will
never chain my... warrior spirit.

515
00:40:22,605 --> 00:40:25,096
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hey, don't forget the little guy.
- Did you just call...?

516
00:40:25,274 --> 00:40:28,441
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Po, what are you doing?
- Trust me. I got a pl...

517
00:40:29,987 --> 00:40:32,988
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No way. Eight-point acupressure cuffs?

518
00:40:33,157 --> 00:40:36,407
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just like the ones that held Tai Lung.
The more you move, the tighter they get.

519
00:40:37,161 --> 00:40:39,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These are the best cuffs!

520
00:40:41,833 --> 00:40:44,502
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greetings, panda. At last we meet!

521
00:40:45,878 --> 00:40:47,705
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no...

522
00:40:51,009 --> 00:40:55,006
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We meet at last! Yes, that's it.

523
00:40:55,179 --> 00:40:57,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greetings, panda. We meet at...

524
00:40:59,183 --> 00:41:02,932
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You are afraid for a reason.
- I am not afraid.

525
00:41:03,104 --> 00:41:05,856
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He is coming to me in chains.

526
00:41:06,024 --> 00:41:08,515
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- If anyone should be afraid, it's...
- You.

527
00:41:11,779 --> 00:41:14,021
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't even think about it.

528
00:41:27,378 --> 00:41:30,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hope this turns out better than
your plan to cook rice in your stomach

529
00:41:30,298 --> 00:41:32,623
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}by eating it raw
and then drinking boiling water.

530
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,876
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This plan's nothing like that plan.

531
00:41:35,053 --> 00:41:37,176
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- How?
- 'Cause this one's going to work.

532
00:41:49,734 --> 00:41:51,727
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keep moving.

533
00:41:57,408 --> 00:41:59,982
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah, my old enemy...

534
00:42:04,499 --> 00:42:06,575
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...stairs.

535
00:42:34,904 --> 00:42:38,107
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks for carrying me
those last few flights. OK.

536
00:42:38,282 --> 00:42:40,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I threw up a little bit
on the third floor.

537
00:42:40,868 --> 00:42:42,279
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Someone might want to clean that up.

538
00:42:42,453 --> 00:42:45,123
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is there some sort of evil janitor
or something?

539
00:42:45,289 --> 00:42:46,867
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greetings, panda.

540
00:42:47,041 --> 00:42:49,366
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We meet at...
- Hey, how you doing?

541
00:42:51,087 --> 00:42:52,498
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey.

542
00:42:52,672 --> 00:42:55,673
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've grown up bigger than I thought.

543
00:42:55,842 --> 00:42:58,546
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey... enough with the poking around.

544
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,471
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Strong. Healthy.

545
00:43:01,639 --> 00:43:04,308
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, I don't know who you are,
but please stand aside, sir.

546
00:43:04,475 --> 00:43:06,931
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That's a lady.
- Oh! Sorry.

547
00:43:07,103 --> 00:43:09,808
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The beard threw me.
It's kind of misleading.

548
00:43:09,981 --> 00:43:13,065
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- False advertising.
- Enough of this nonsense!

549
00:43:13,234 --> 00:43:14,894
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bring the prisoners to me.

550
00:43:15,069 --> 00:43:16,694
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, ma'am. Get ready, guys.

551
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:19,401
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keep your eyes peeled for the...
weapon!

552
00:43:23,828 --> 00:43:25,026
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sparrow kick!

553
00:43:27,081 --> 00:43:30,248
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We did it! I just kung fu-ed it!
Did you guys see that? I was all like...

554
00:43:39,427 --> 00:43:42,677
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you actually believe this is
the warrior destined to defeat me?

555
00:43:42,847 --> 00:43:46,014
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I do not. I know he is.

556
00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:50,761
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, look at him.
A lifetime to plot his revenge

557
00:43:50,938 --> 00:43:54,438
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- and he comes to me on his knees.
- What? A lifetime?

558
00:43:54,609 --> 00:43:55,854
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I did not have a lifetime.

559
00:43:56,027 --> 00:43:57,984
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We only heard about Master Rhino
a few days ago,

560
00:43:58,154 --> 00:44:02,863
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- and we came to avenge him!
- You've come to avenge nothing else?

561
00:44:03,034 --> 00:44:05,525
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, yeah.
All the pots and pans that you stole.

562
00:44:05,703 --> 00:44:08,111
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm gonna want those back.
- Nothing else?

563
00:44:08,289 --> 00:44:10,863
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You probably did some other evil stuff
along the way. I don't know.

564
00:44:11,042 --> 00:44:13,165
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What else did you do?
- You don't know?

565
00:44:13,336 --> 00:44:15,578
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Know what? What's so funny?

566
00:44:15,755 --> 00:44:18,875
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The very thing
that you clearly do not know!

567
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:22,964
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK, enough of these riddles!
Would you guys spill the beans?

568
00:44:23,137 --> 00:44:26,471
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}First, we come in and the weapon
is tiny. Surprise, it's big.

569
00:44:26,641 --> 00:44:29,642
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then the lady over here,
I think it's a guy, 'cause he's got...

570
00:44:30,978 --> 00:44:33,516
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The only reason you are still alive

571
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:38,482
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is that I find your stupidity
mildly amusing.

572
00:44:38,653 --> 00:44:41,986
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, thank you. But I find your
evilness extremely annoying.

573
00:44:42,156 --> 00:44:44,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who do you think you are, panda?

574
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,905
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who do you think I am, peacock?

575
00:44:55,503 --> 00:44:57,661
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are we laughing?

576
00:44:58,715 --> 00:44:59,877
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take aim.

577
00:45:11,561 --> 00:45:12,972
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fire.

578
00:45:17,108 --> 00:45:19,813
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, light the... thing!

579
00:45:19,986 --> 00:45:21,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I did!

580
00:45:26,367 --> 00:45:28,241
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fear the bug!

581
00:45:37,295 --> 00:45:38,754
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get the weapon!

582
00:45:40,757 --> 00:45:42,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tigress!

583
00:46:15,458 --> 00:46:16,869
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You... You were there.

584
00:46:17,043 --> 00:46:19,997
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. Yes, I was.

585
00:46:27,845 --> 00:46:31,012
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You just let Shen get away!
- At least we destroyed the weapon.

586
00:46:35,645 --> 00:46:37,056
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fire!

587
00:46:40,024 --> 00:46:41,851
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh. No, he's got way more.

588
00:46:48,199 --> 00:46:49,574
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- My wing!
- Help, Po!

589
00:46:49,742 --> 00:46:51,153
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Coming!

590
00:46:52,036 --> 00:46:54,444
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Watch out!
- Po!

591
00:46:57,750 --> 00:47:00,621
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Help me up!
- No. Get him down.

592
00:47:00,795 --> 00:47:02,337
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Use the ropes.

593
00:47:11,222 --> 00:47:13,298
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Run, run, little panda!

594
00:47:24,569 --> 00:47:27,653
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Po, come on. We need you to focus!
- I got it, I got it!

595
00:47:27,822 --> 00:47:29,447
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bring it down!

596
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:35,199
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We're trapped!
- This way!

597
00:47:39,584 --> 00:47:41,078
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Goodbye!

598
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:45,458
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fire!

599
00:47:46,924 --> 00:47:48,335
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get back!

600
00:47:56,392 --> 00:47:58,385
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The only way out is up.

601
00:47:59,103 --> 00:48:00,514
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

602
00:48:11,532 --> 00:48:13,988
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Follow me! Come on!

603
00:48:14,577 --> 00:48:15,905
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are they going?

604
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:18,914
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- To the top!
- Come on! Keep going!

605
00:48:26,172 --> 00:48:27,714
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here we go!

606
00:48:46,401 --> 00:48:49,734
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You idiot!
- My nose!

607
00:48:49,904 --> 00:48:54,317
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Call in the wolves! All of them!
I want them ready to move!

608
00:48:54,492 --> 00:48:58,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Year of the Peacock begins now!

609
00:48:58,287 --> 00:49:01,158
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right now?
'Cause it's the middle of the year,

610
00:49:01,332 --> 00:49:04,001
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so you'd only get like
a half of the Year of the Peacock.

611
00:49:05,795 --> 00:49:08,915
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And this is the Year, of course,
of the Peacock.

612
00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:11,083
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Happy New Year, sir.

613
00:49:14,929 --> 00:49:19,176
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get the wolves ready.
We're loading the ships now.

614
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:20,429
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now!

615
00:49:20,601 --> 00:49:22,511
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, now, now, now, now!

616
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:25,474
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Move! Move, move, move, move!

617
00:49:41,873 --> 00:49:43,497
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This way.

618
00:49:47,879 --> 00:49:49,706
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go.

619
00:49:55,053 --> 00:49:55,966
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, you!

620
00:49:56,304 --> 00:49:58,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did you do?
It's chaos up there.

621
00:49:58,556 --> 00:50:00,216
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happened to stopping Shen?

622
00:50:01,684 --> 00:50:03,309
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

623
00:50:04,729 --> 00:50:06,887
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guys, come on.
Give me a little credit.

624
00:50:07,065 --> 00:50:09,188
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I meant for him to get away.

625
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:12,313
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}'Cause... it was a trick. It was a plot.

626
00:50:12,487 --> 00:50:17,398
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was thinking...
I'll figure out his plot more.

627
00:50:18,076 --> 00:50:20,068
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That makes no sense.

628
00:50:20,244 --> 00:50:21,904
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you mean? Sure it does.

629
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:25,413
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Po, the truth.
You had Shen. What happened?

630
00:50:25,583 --> 00:50:27,623
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you talking about?
I don't know what you're talking about.

631
00:50:27,794 --> 00:50:30,332
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I... Yeah...
OK, he caught me off guard.

632
00:50:31,047 --> 00:50:32,292
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The truth.

633
00:50:35,677 --> 00:50:39,425
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fine. They will keep you
far from danger.

634
00:50:39,597 --> 00:50:42,135
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Real far.
- What?

635
00:50:42,308 --> 00:50:44,431
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're staying here.

636
00:50:44,936 --> 00:50:47,343
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait! I have to go ba...

637
00:50:52,735 --> 00:50:54,562
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're staying here!

638
00:50:55,113 --> 00:50:57,271
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going. And you can't stop me.

639
00:51:00,576 --> 00:51:02,818
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK. I wasn't ready that time.

640
00:51:02,995 --> 00:51:04,703
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guys? Don't.

641
00:51:04,872 --> 00:51:05,952
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ready.

642
00:51:06,582 --> 00:51:07,614
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look!

643
00:51:20,179 --> 00:51:21,555
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stay down.

644
00:51:23,182 --> 00:51:26,267
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I have to get to him.
- Then tell me why!

645
00:51:28,646 --> 00:51:30,971
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was there! OK?

646
00:51:31,149 --> 00:51:34,352
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The peacock was there
the last time I saw my parents.

647
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:38,145
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He knows what happened.
Where I came from.

648
00:51:38,322 --> 00:51:40,778
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who I am.

649
00:51:44,328 --> 00:51:46,451
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, I'm going.

650
00:51:47,081 --> 00:51:49,489
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have to know.

651
00:51:49,667 --> 00:51:51,707
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The hard core can't understand.

652
00:51:51,878 --> 00:51:53,586
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tigress, no!

653
00:51:57,759 --> 00:51:59,751
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The hard core do understand.

654
00:52:01,471 --> 00:52:04,092
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I can't watch my friend be killed.

655
00:52:05,516 --> 00:52:09,596
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We're going.
- Maybe you can't watch me be killed?

656
00:52:09,771 --> 00:52:12,688
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Stop being a wimp.
- And she's back.

657
00:52:14,359 --> 00:52:16,517
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No.
- Don't worry, kid.

658
00:52:16,694 --> 00:52:18,486
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're better off here.

659
00:52:28,039 --> 00:52:32,535
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were wrong, Soothsayer.
We sail to victory tonight.

660
00:52:33,378 --> 00:52:35,703
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your magic panda is clearly a fool.

661
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:38,834
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you certain it is the panda
who is a fool?

662
00:52:39,008 --> 00:52:41,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You just destroyed
your ancestral home, Shen.

663
00:52:41,552 --> 00:52:46,891
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A trivial sacrifice...
when all of China is my reward.

664
00:52:47,058 --> 00:52:49,513
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then will you finally be satisfied?

665
00:52:49,686 --> 00:52:53,897
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will the subjugation of the whole world
finally make you feel better?

666
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:58,438
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a start. I might also convert
the basement into a dungeon.

667
00:53:01,364 --> 00:53:04,069
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The cup you choose to fill
has no bottom.

668
00:53:04,242 --> 00:53:07,243
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is time to stop this madness.

669
00:53:08,287 --> 00:53:10,197
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why on earth would I do that?

670
00:53:10,373 --> 00:53:12,579
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So your parents can rest in peace.

671
00:53:13,418 --> 00:53:16,372
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My parents hated me.

672
00:53:17,588 --> 00:53:20,459
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you understand?

673
00:53:20,633 --> 00:53:26,007
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They wronged me...
and I will make it right.

674
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:27,461
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They loved you.

675
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:32,386
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They loved you so much that
having to send you away killed them.

676
00:53:34,981 --> 00:53:40,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The dead exist in the past...
and I must tend to the future.

677
00:53:45,616 --> 00:53:49,661
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Set the soothsayer free.
She's no use to me.

678
00:53:49,829 --> 00:53:53,447
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Goodbye, Shen.
I wish you happiness.

679
00:53:53,624 --> 00:53:56,329
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Happiness must be taken.

680
00:53:57,962 --> 00:54:00,334
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I will take mine.

681
00:54:22,236 --> 00:54:24,988
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hurry it up!
- Move it!

682
00:54:26,115 --> 00:54:29,235
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If all of those weapons
leave the building, China will fall.

683
00:54:29,410 --> 00:54:33,704
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We bring down the building.
- Hey, guys. How about this?

684
00:54:36,334 --> 00:54:38,492
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- This will work!
- All right, let's go.

685
00:54:38,669 --> 00:54:40,164
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't feel my face.

686
00:54:55,645 --> 00:54:58,599
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you hear him call it
Year of the Peacock?

687
00:54:58,773 --> 00:55:01,015
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hey.
- Hey.

688
00:55:01,192 --> 00:55:02,734
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK. So, keep it cool.
Keep it cool. Keep it cool.

689
00:55:02,902 --> 00:55:05,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You! Where are you going?

690
00:55:07,407 --> 00:55:10,858
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}On your feet! And wipe those
stupid grins off your faces.

691
00:55:24,298 --> 00:55:28,082
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Move, you dogs!
Faster, faster! Load them all!

692
00:55:38,396 --> 00:55:40,389
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greetings, panda.

693
00:55:43,985 --> 00:55:46,986
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Tell me what happened that night.
- What night?

694
00:55:47,155 --> 00:55:50,156
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That night.
- Ah, that night.

695
00:55:50,324 --> 00:55:53,325
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes! We're talking
about the same night, right?

696
00:55:54,245 --> 00:55:58,029
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, I was there. Yes. I watched
as your parents abandoned you.

697
00:55:58,207 --> 00:56:02,786
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a terrible thing.
I believe it went something like this.

698
00:56:12,930 --> 00:56:14,389
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here's your New Year's gift.

699
00:56:14,557 --> 00:56:16,715
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hope you like it,
'cause you can't return it.

700
00:56:18,603 --> 00:56:20,975
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Po? What's he doing here?

701
00:56:21,898 --> 00:56:23,143
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Return it! Return it!

702
00:56:35,203 --> 00:56:37,741
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you willing to die
to find the truth?

703
00:56:37,914 --> 00:56:41,496
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You bet I am.
Although I'd prefer not to.

704
00:57:04,273 --> 00:57:05,981
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got them. Go!

705
00:57:27,714 --> 00:57:29,208
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You looking for me?

706
00:57:36,222 --> 00:57:38,013
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I said that too soon, didn't I?

707
00:57:46,441 --> 00:57:47,603
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Po!

708
00:57:52,363 --> 00:57:53,905
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Po, get away from him.

709
00:57:54,073 --> 00:57:56,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll get up. Here we go.

710
00:57:58,828 --> 00:58:01,497
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No more running, Shen.
- So it seems.

711
00:58:01,664 --> 00:58:03,657
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now... answers.

712
00:58:03,833 --> 00:58:06,585
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, you want to know so badly.

713
00:58:07,211 --> 00:58:10,415
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think knowing will heal you, huh?

714
00:58:10,590 --> 00:58:14,634
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fill some crater in your soul?

715
00:58:14,802 --> 00:58:16,961
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, here's your answer.

716
00:58:17,138 --> 00:58:20,222
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your parents didn't love you.

717
00:58:21,267 --> 00:58:23,141
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But here...

718
00:58:23,311 --> 00:58:25,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...let me heal you!

719
00:58:31,986 --> 00:58:33,778
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

720
00:59:48,354 --> 00:59:50,845
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, like you could make me drink that.

721
00:59:55,111 --> 00:59:59,358
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I wanted you dead,
I would have left you in that river.

722
00:59:59,532 --> 01:00:03,482
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Well, why save me?
- So you can fulfil your destiny.

723
01:00:03,661 --> 01:00:06,864
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you talking about?
Where am I?

724
01:00:09,167 --> 01:00:10,709
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is this place?

725
01:00:10,877 --> 01:00:14,874
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm surprised you remember so little.

726
01:00:15,048 --> 01:00:18,499
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you were so little when it happened.

727
01:00:23,806 --> 01:00:26,344
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perhaps you do remember.

728
01:00:26,517 --> 01:00:28,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? It's just a stupid nightmare.

729
01:00:28,686 --> 01:00:30,762
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nightmare? Or memory?

730
01:01:01,719 --> 01:01:04,341
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This was a thriving village.

731
01:01:04,514 --> 01:01:08,048
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Young Shen was in line
to rule Gongmen City.

732
01:01:08,226 --> 01:01:10,053
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But he wanted more.

733
01:01:10,228 --> 01:01:15,981
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I foretold that someone would stand
in his way. A panda.

734
01:01:16,150 --> 01:01:20,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I never could have foretold
what came next.

735
01:01:33,292 --> 01:01:34,703
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get them all!

736
01:01:41,467 --> 01:01:44,753
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take our son and run away! Go!

737
01:01:58,317 --> 01:02:01,936
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop fighting. Let it flow.

738
01:04:05,862 --> 01:04:09,942
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your story may not have
such a happy beginning,

739
01:04:10,116 --> 01:04:13,236
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but that doesn't
make you who you are.

740
01:04:13,411 --> 01:04:15,949
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is the rest of your story.

741
01:04:16,789 --> 01:04:18,948
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who you choose to be.

742
01:04:51,115 --> 01:04:54,484
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, who are you, panda?

743
01:05:02,752 --> 01:05:04,163
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am Po.

744
01:05:05,963 --> 01:05:07,921
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I'm gonna need a hat.

745
01:05:17,350 --> 01:05:20,304
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Such sad, sad faces.

746
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:23,184
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But now is a time only for joy.

747
01:05:23,356 --> 01:05:27,401
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are going to be part
of something beautiful.

748
01:05:29,654 --> 01:05:33,652
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Once we reach the harbour,
in front of all the world,

749
01:05:33,825 --> 01:05:37,988
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you and your precious kung fu will die.

750
01:05:40,164 --> 01:05:45,075
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then China will know to bow before me.

751
01:05:45,253 --> 01:05:46,913
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Set sail!

752
01:05:58,182 --> 01:05:59,593
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is that?

753
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:23,246
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honestly, guys,
I never thought I'd die like this.

754
01:06:23,416 --> 01:06:26,417
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I always thought I'd meet
a nice girl and settle down and...

755
01:06:26,586 --> 01:06:28,329
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...then she'd eat my head.

756
01:06:28,504 --> 01:06:30,912
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- So sad.
- We cannot give up hope.

757
01:06:31,090 --> 01:06:35,633
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Po would want us to remain strong.
Hard-core. Right, Tigress?

758
01:06:43,603 --> 01:06:47,553
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Lord Shen, what about the bridge?
- Nothing stands in my way.

759
01:06:48,274 --> 01:06:49,472
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fire!

760
01:06:58,743 --> 01:07:00,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You coward!

761
01:07:10,505 --> 01:07:11,584
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Po?

762
01:07:14,008 --> 01:07:15,039
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Po?

763
01:07:17,136 --> 01:07:22,261
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How many times do I have to kill
the same stinking panda?

764
01:07:31,859 --> 01:07:33,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shen!

765
01:07:33,444 --> 01:07:37,489
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A panda stands between you
and your destiny.

766
01:07:38,199 --> 01:07:39,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

767
01:07:39,409 --> 01:07:43,406
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Prepare yourself for a
hot serving of justice.

768
01:07:43,579 --> 01:07:45,239
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your reign of terror comes to an end.

769
01:07:45,415 --> 01:07:48,665
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What?
- And now, free the Five!

770
01:07:48,835 --> 01:07:50,911
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Disc of Destruction!

771
01:08:02,015 --> 01:08:04,932
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK. Take aim!

772
01:08:16,237 --> 01:08:17,862
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ready?

773
01:08:38,801 --> 01:08:40,758
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't follow me.

774
01:08:40,928 --> 01:08:42,008
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just get him!

775
01:08:47,310 --> 01:08:49,053
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah. Here we go.
- Come on!

776
01:08:56,319 --> 01:08:57,694
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No, no, no, don't shoot!
- Don't shoot!

777
01:08:57,862 --> 01:08:58,893
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, don't shoot!

778
01:08:59,072 --> 01:09:01,479
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Don't shoot!
- Don't shoot!

779
01:09:01,657 --> 01:09:04,065
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You don't shoot!
- I won't shoot if you won't shoot.

780
01:09:06,454 --> 01:09:07,485
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah!

781
01:09:07,663 --> 01:09:10,534
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Don't shoot! Cross fire!
- Attack!

782
01:09:16,714 --> 01:09:19,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Catch of Freedom!
- Monkey!

783
01:09:24,514 --> 01:09:26,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Impressive, Dragon Warrior.
What's your plan?

784
01:09:26,891 --> 01:09:29,049
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Step one, free the Five.
- What's step two?

785
01:09:29,227 --> 01:09:30,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honestly, I didn't think
I'd make it this far.

786
01:09:31,145 --> 01:09:32,177
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Po!

787
01:09:32,355 --> 01:09:34,478
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop Shen before he gets to the harbour.

788
01:09:40,029 --> 01:09:41,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nice!

789
01:09:43,658 --> 01:09:44,986
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Viper, Puppet of Death!

790
01:09:45,702 --> 01:09:46,733
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tigress!

791
01:09:55,420 --> 01:09:57,412
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Master Ox!
- Jump!

792
01:09:57,588 --> 01:10:00,079
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- And Croc!
- Vengeance is served.

793
01:10:00,258 --> 01:10:03,093
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Why did you...?
- Your friend there is very persuasive.

794
01:10:10,727 --> 01:10:11,925
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Master Shifu!

795
01:10:14,272 --> 01:10:16,597
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Quickly. Use their boats
to block the way.

796
01:10:27,410 --> 01:10:28,441
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Crane!

797
01:10:29,412 --> 01:10:31,321
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wings of Justice!

798
01:10:33,416 --> 01:10:34,614
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah!

799
01:10:40,757 --> 01:10:41,788
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

800
01:10:51,809 --> 01:10:55,889
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love you guys.

801
01:11:04,822 --> 01:11:06,482
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why aren't we firing?

802
01:11:06,657 --> 01:11:10,073
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're taking out our gunners, sir.
They're getting close.

803
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:14,825
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fire! Fire at them!

804
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:19,082
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- But, sir, we'll kill our own.
- I said fire at them!

805
01:11:19,253 --> 01:11:20,285
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fire!

806
01:11:22,924 --> 01:11:23,955
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

807
01:11:31,599 --> 01:11:32,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Po!

808
01:12:08,469 --> 01:12:09,584
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tigress?

809
01:12:59,437 --> 01:13:01,145
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As you wish.

810
01:13:01,314 --> 01:13:02,938
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's finish this.

811
01:13:26,631 --> 01:13:27,829
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fire!

812
01:13:32,887 --> 01:13:34,714
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Inner peace.

813
01:14:02,166 --> 01:14:03,198
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Again!

814
01:14:10,508 --> 01:14:11,539
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah!

815
01:14:12,844 --> 01:14:15,798
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kill him! Somebody kill him!

816
01:14:37,994 --> 01:14:40,401
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? No. No!

817
01:14:47,045 --> 01:14:50,045
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keep firing! Keep firing!

818
01:15:10,806 --> 01:15:12,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Skadoosh.

819
01:15:42,433 --> 01:15:43,762
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How did you...?

820
01:15:45,186 --> 01:15:46,811
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How did you do it?

821
01:15:50,650 --> 01:15:53,271
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, you just keep your elbows up
and keep the shoulders loose.

822
01:15:53,444 --> 01:15:56,611
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not that. How did you find peace?

823
01:15:56,781 --> 01:16:00,446
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I took away your parents. Everything.

824
01:16:00,618 --> 01:16:02,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I scarred you for life.

825
01:16:03,621 --> 01:16:07,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See, that's the thing, Shen.
Scars heal.

826
01:16:07,291 --> 01:16:11,289
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, they don't. Wounds heal.

827
01:16:11,462 --> 01:16:13,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah. What do scars do?
They fade, I guess?

828
01:16:14,048 --> 01:16:18,461
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I don't care what scars do.
- You should, Shen.

829
01:16:18,636 --> 01:16:22,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You gotta let go of that stuff from
the past, 'cause it just doesn't matter.

830
01:16:22,724 --> 01:16:27,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The only thing that matters
is what you choose to be now.

831
01:16:27,395 --> 01:16:28,806
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're right.

832
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:31,352
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then I choose... this!

833
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:26,366
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was pretty hard-core.

834
01:17:35,713 --> 01:17:36,792
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Po!
- You did it!

835
01:17:36,964 --> 01:17:40,049
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Come here! Yeah!
- Don't ever do that again, please.

836
01:17:40,218 --> 01:17:43,883
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It seems you have found inner peace.

837
01:17:44,055 --> 01:17:46,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And at such a young age.

838
01:17:46,557 --> 01:17:48,431
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I had a pretty good teacher.

839
01:18:09,414 --> 01:18:13,079
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you mean he's not here?
It's my son's birthday.

840
01:18:13,251 --> 01:18:15,623
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All he wanted was to meet
the Dragon Warrior.

841
01:18:15,795 --> 01:18:18,547
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How about some tofu birthday cake
instead, huh?

842
01:18:18,715 --> 01:18:21,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, I think we'll
just try again another time.

843
01:18:21,718 --> 01:18:23,093
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When do you think he'll be back?

844
01:18:26,055 --> 01:18:30,053
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. OK, I don't know.
Maybe never.

845
01:18:30,226 --> 01:18:33,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, I worry, OK?
But that's my job, I'm his dad.

846
01:18:33,730 --> 01:18:35,936
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At least, I was his dad.

847
01:18:36,107 --> 01:18:39,725
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why did he have to go and save China?
I know why.

848
01:18:39,902 --> 01:18:43,603
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But why? He's just one little panda.

849
01:18:59,130 --> 01:19:02,914
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, how did it go?
Did you save China?

850
01:19:03,926 --> 01:19:05,302
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yep.

851
01:19:05,470 --> 01:19:07,758
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I knew you would.

852
01:19:07,930 --> 01:19:09,674
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's why I had new signs made.

853
01:19:09,849 --> 01:19:12,091
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"My son saved China.
You, too, can save.

854
01:19:12,268 --> 01:19:14,759
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buy one dumpling, get one free."

855
01:19:14,937 --> 01:19:16,313
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, that's a pretty good deal.

856
01:19:16,481 --> 01:19:19,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Would you like to try one?
- Maybe later.

857
01:19:21,944 --> 01:19:24,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's something I should tell you.

858
01:19:26,824 --> 01:19:31,237
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}While I was gone,
I found the village where I was born.

859
01:19:32,955 --> 01:19:36,324
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I found out how I ended up
in that radish basket.

860
01:19:36,501 --> 01:19:38,125
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You did?

861
01:19:38,961 --> 01:19:42,876
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I know who I am.
- You do?

862
01:19:44,884 --> 01:19:46,509
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm your son.

863
01:19:52,642 --> 01:19:54,266
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love you, Dad.

864
01:19:55,311 --> 01:19:57,185
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love you, too, son.

865
01:20:01,234 --> 01:20:03,273
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Delicious, fat radishes!

866
01:20:03,444 --> 01:20:05,567
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're probably hungry.
Let me make you something to eat.

867
01:20:05,738 --> 01:20:07,482
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you talking about? I'll cook.

868
01:20:07,657 --> 01:20:09,068
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No, no, I'll cook.
- Dad!

869
01:20:09,242 --> 01:20:11,365
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, it's the least I can do.
You saved China.

870
01:20:11,536 --> 01:20:13,824
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, it's the least I can do.
You raised me.

871
01:20:13,996 --> 01:20:15,028
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Po.
- Dad.

872
01:20:15,206 --> 01:20:16,665
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Po!
- OK.

873
01:20:16,833 --> 01:20:19,454
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's both cook. Together.

874
01:20:19,627 --> 01:20:20,908
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Together.

875
01:20:21,087 --> 01:20:22,665
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I'll cook.

876
01:20:34,665 --> 01:20:50,665
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}亲，有空的时候可以来交流电影哦 加我QQ：1610169789

877
01:20:57,582 --> 01:20:59,989
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My son is alive.
