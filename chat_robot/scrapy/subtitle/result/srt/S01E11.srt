1
00:00:01,834 --> 00:00:03,669
星际之门之亚特兰蒂斯 前情提要
Previously on Stargate Atlantis.

2
00:00:03,711 --> 00:00:04,921
这不会是一个风暴
It can't be a storm.

3
00:00:04,962 --> 00:00:06,881
它占据了整个地平线
It stretches across the whole horizon.

4
00:00:06,923 --> 00:00:08,883
它至少覆盖了星球20% 的地区
This must cover 20 percent of the planet.

5
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:10,885
如果你不想有人伤亡,那就得把他们弄出去
If you want everyone to live,
you gate them off world.

6
00:00:10,968 --> 00:00:13,930
之后的一个小时内,Atlantis里只会有不足10个的人
而且大部分都是科学家.
Within the next hour, there will be
less than 10 people on atlantis.

7
00:00:13,971 --> 00:00:16,766
我们不能错失这个机会.
We cannot afford to pass up this opportunity.

8
00:00:17,016 --> 00:00:20,311
我们无法开启防御系统的唯一阻碍是什么?
What is the one thing keeping us from having a shield?

9
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:21,812
电力
Electricity.

10
00:00:21,854 --> 00:00:24,607
Atlantis的设计是足以经受闪电的袭击的
Atlantis is designed
to withstand substantial lightning strikes.

11
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:26,108
城市中到处都有避雷针.
There are lightning rods all over the city.

12
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,777
如果我们停止地下站
If we disable the grounding stations,

13
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,820
无庸怀疑，我们就可以使用这些能量
that energy could conceivably be used

14
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,989
来给我们的护罩发生器补充能量
to charge up the shield generators.

15
00:00:31,989 --> 00:00:34,242
我们决定待在探险者2号里面
等风暴过了再回去
We decided to wait out the storm in the jumper.

16
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:42,959
据我所知
一小队Genii武装力量闯了进来
From what I can ascertain,
a small Genii strike force has gated in.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,210
为什么这么做?
Why are you doing this?

18
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:46,337
你们拥有我们非常需要的东西
You are in possession of supplies we vitally need...

19
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,340
C-4炸药, 以及你们所有的药品
the C-4 explosive, all of your medical supplies.

20
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:54,011
现在...我们控制了 Atlantis.
As of right now, we are in control of atlantis.

21
00:00:54,178 --> 00:00:56,097
跟Weir博士告别吧.
Say goodbye to Dr. Weir.

22
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,683
现在的结局是...
And now the conclusion...

23
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,687
Kolya!
Kolya!

24
00:01:04,188 --> 00:01:06,107
Kolya, 不要这么做!
Kolya, don't do this!

25
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,735
这对获取你所需要的有什么帮助么?
How is this going to help you get what you want?

26
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:11,904
这是让Sheppard给逼的, 不能怪我
Sheppard put you in this position, not me.

27
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,198
你不能这么做. 这太疯狂了. 你需要她.
You can't do this. This is crazy. You need her.

28
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,449
她是对的, 司令官
She's right, commander.

29
00:01:15,491 --> 00:01:17,368
启动防护罩需要密码
There are codes required to activate the shield,

30
00:01:17,451 --> 00:01:19,829
只要她知道这个密码
没有她, 你将无法启动防护罩
codes that only she knows.
You can't do it without her.

31
00:01:22,748 --> 00:01:24,208
没有我你也不能
You can't do this without me either.

32
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:25,877
我的意思是, 我们是一个有机的整体
I mean, we're a package deal.

33
00:01:25,918 --> 00:01:27,378
如果你把我们之间的这种平衡打破
You take us out of the equation,

34
00:01:27,461 --> 00:01:29,672
你将不会得到有一个好的收场的
and you don't have an end-game.

35
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,342
要知道, 这就像是一个棋局
Granted, that's a chess term.

36
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:37,138
我的意思是只有我们可以修好地下站
My point is we're the only ones
who can fix the grounding station.

37
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,431
只有我们可以启动防护罩
We're the only ones who can activate the shield.

38
00:01:38,514 --> 00:01:40,516
也只有我们可以解决那些无法想像的问题
We're the only ones that can
solve problems I can't even think of yet.

39
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,851
你只要杀死我们当中的任何一个
You kill either one of us,

40
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,186
你就不会得到你所想要的
and you don't get what you want.

41
00:01:43,227 --> 00:01:44,478
这就是我们的重要性
That's how important we are.

42
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,438
Rodney.
Rodney.

43
00:01:46,522 --> 00:01:48,065
Rodney, 他知道了
Rodney, he gets it.

44
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,490
多谢你的...
I appreciate your...

45
00:01:56,532 --> 00:01:59,327
你对我们完成此次任务还有用
You're an asset we need to complete this mission.

46
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:06,584
你为了我站在一支枪的前面
You stepped in front of a gun for me.

47
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,044
现在先不忙谢我
Don't thank me just yet.

48
00:02:08,085 --> 00:02:11,422
离风暴来临只有两个半小时了
除非我们运气绝对好
We've got two and a half hours till the storm hits,
and unless our luck changes drastically,

49
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,341
这座城市将被湮没
this city is going to be obliterated.

50
00:02:30,274 --> 00:02:33,027
Sheppard少校, 你相信么
Major Sheppard, how's this for credibility?

51
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,905
Weir死了
Weir is dead.

52
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:39,992
我要杀了你
I'm going to kill you.

53
00:02:40,284 --> 00:02:41,661
也许吧
Maybe.

54
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:44,247
别挡我的路, 要不McKay也会去跟她做伴
Stay out of my way, or McKay will join her.

55
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:03,653
星际之门之亚特兰蒂斯
第一季第11集 暴风眼
Season 1 : Episode 11 The Eye

56
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:24,555
这太令人惊奇了
This is amazing.

57
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:32,605
你过来
There you are.

58
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,025
我们在这儿
We're here.

59
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,194
让两个人到那去
Take two men, head there.

60
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,779
下面四层
Four levels down.

61
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,365
那是Sheppard.
That's Sheppard.

62
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:43,658
是的,长官
Yes, sir.

63
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,826
我们走
Let's go.

64
00:04:46,285 --> 00:04:47,495
你留在这
You're with me.

65
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,330
他正走出走廊
He's heading out of the hallways.

66
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,939
- 终于来了
- 就是它
- Holy Grail
- That's it!

67
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:18,067
你在做什么?
What are you doing, man?

68
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:21,237
调节惯性阀, 给我们的飞船增加点重量
Adding weight to the puddle jumper
by resetting its inertial dampeners.

69
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,364
你不该动它
我们已经足够重了
You shouldn't screw with those controls.
We're heavy enough.

70
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,490
难道不能再小心一点么?
Can't be too careful.

71
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,492
是的, 你行. 我想你是过于小心了.
Yes, you can. You can be way too careful.

72
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:29,245
我们不可能被吹走的
There's no chance we're going to blow away here.

73
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,371
够了
Let it go.

74
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,998
这应该够了
That should be enough.

75
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:34,041
风暴还要持续多久?
How much longer until the storm passes?

76
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,502
我想可能一半还不到
I guess we're barely halfway through,

77
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,087
但我没法告诉你
but there's no way to tell.

78
00:05:45,469 --> 00:05:47,346
你知道, 我也希望他们都还好
You know, I hope they're okay, too.

79
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:39,315
怎么了?
What's this then?

80
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,443
风暴过去了?
We're through it?

81
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:44,403
不会
We can't be.

82
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,947
那是不可能的
It's not possible.

83
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,352
他在动
He's moving.

84
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,696
你肯定我们确实应该在这一层么?
Are you sure we're on the right level?

85
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,294
他到哪里去了?
Where did he go?

86
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:44,213
他会听到你那愚蠢的问题的
He can probably hear your stupid questions.

87
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,235
Oh, 你想来看看么?
Oh, will you look at this?

88
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,238
现在, 它已经...
Now, that is just...

89
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,908
这再也不能用了
That is never going to be useful again.

90
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:27,048
我想我应该可以接一个旁路
把整个开关绕开
I should be able to bypass
the switching station entirely.

91
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,674
很好, 这要多久?
Good. How long?

92
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,219
实际上这比看起来的要糟得多
It's not half as bad as it looks.

93
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,179
我想最多15, 20分钟吧
I'd say 15, 20 minutes tops.

94
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,388
干吧
Do it.

95
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,474
Weir博士, 我需要你来...
Dr. Weir, I need you to...

96
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,767
好的, 当然
Right, of course.

97
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,103
把那按住
Keep that there.

98
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,605
我们在风暴眼中
We're in the eye.

99
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:25,857
是的
Right.

100
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,275
一定是
Has to be.

101
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:28,526
风暴眼?
The eye?

102
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,986
风暴的正中心
Dead center of the storm.

103
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:33,823
风暴在周围旋转
这是一个20到40公里宽的区域
The storm swirls around
a 20- to 40- kilometer-wide area.

104
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,575
那就是说, 这种宁静不会持续下去?
Then this calm will not last?

105
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:37,952
当然, 实际上, 大约只有10分钟
No, in fact, in about 10 minutes,

106
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,579
马上就又会变得非常糟糕的
it's going to get very ugly again.

107
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,455
好的, 来吧
我们必须去帮助少校
Well, come on. We have to help the major.

108
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,000
我们可以起飞, 但是降落将会非常困难
相信我
We can take off, but landing is twice as hard,
believe me.

109
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,293
那如果风暴到达atlantis又将会怎样?
What if the storm's reached atlantis?

110
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,043
它到了么?
Has it?

111
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,461
现在还没有, 不过随时会到
Not just yet, but it will anytime now.

112
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,589
不要浪费时间了. 我们走, 我们走吧
Stop wasting time. Let's go. Let's go.

113
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:53,342
我们仍然必须穿过风暴, 中尉
这太疯狂了
We would still have to fly straight
through the storm, lieutenant. It's insanity.

114
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,094
这不是疯狂
这是一艘太空船
This is not insanity. This is a spaceship.

115
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,137
我们可以飞到风暴上面
We can fly up and over.

116
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:57,138
一直上去然后再下来?
Straight up and down?

117
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,055
一直上去然后再下来
Straight up and down.

118
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,224
我只是一个普通的医学博士, 不是一个魔术师
I'm a bloody medical doctor, not a magician.

119
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,142
我们可以做到
You can do it.

120
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:01,934
Teyla?
Teyla?

121
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,936
如果我们可以帮助, 那我们就必须去
If we can help, we must.

122
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,524
Oh, 我认输
Oh, crap.

123
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:11,777
20英尺远
20 feet away.

124
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,457
5英尺
Five feet.

125
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,167
这里的烟太多了
There's so much smoke.

126
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,668
哪边?
Which way?

127
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:31,631
你们在他的正上方
You're right on top of him.

128
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:34,217
是么? 如果他在我应该可以看到他
Yeah? I think I would see him if I was.

129
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:36,135
不要动
Stand by.

130
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:48,773
看见他了么?
Do you see him?

131
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:53,027
抓住他了么?
Did you get him?

132
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:55,696
报告
Report.

133
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,291
司令官
Commander.

134
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,001
是的, Sora.
Yes, Sora.

135
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:12,296
Ladon让三个人进行搜索行动
Ladon had been leading three of our men
on a reconnaissance mission.

136
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:16,467
看起来 Sheppard 少校又杀了我们三个人
It seems major Sheppard has killed
three more of our strike team.

137
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:18,845
告诉所有人回到控制室
Tell everyone to move back to the control room.

138
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:19,971
马上, 长官
Right away, sir.

139
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:26,269
你为什么告诉他你可以在15到20分钟内
把这个修好
Why did you tell him you could have
this fixed in 15 to 20 minutes?

140
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,603
Oh, 我不知道
Oh, I don't know.

141
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:30,064
也许这样他就不会杀了我们
Maybe so he wouldn't kill us.

142
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:33,192
我能理解, 不过一旦防护罩运作起来
I understand that, but once the shield is operational,

143
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:35,486
我们将不再有用
现在, 我们该怎么办?
we won't be very useful, now, will we?

144
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,947
那你为什么让我告诉他我可以在15到20分钟内把它修好?
Why did you let me tell him I could fix it in 15 or 20?

145
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,782
你必须跟他再拖延一下时间
You just have to stall him some more.

146
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,492
好, 我刚刚告诉它修好这个要多久
Well, I just told him how long it'll take.

147
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,286
那就在它身上再找一个问题
Find another problem with it.

148
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:46,414
告诉他们能量循环接口
Tell them that the power loop interface

149
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,541
无法与你的工作配合, 之类的
isn't jiving with your walkabout, something.

150
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:49,542
"无法配合"?
"Isn't jiving"?

151
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,335
Rodney, 我就是这个意思
Rodney, you get my point.

152
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,337
根据现在的情况来看
Though from the sounds of it,

153
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,922
如果我们给Sheppard足够的时间
if we give major Sheppard enough time,

154
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,758
他应该可以解决剩下那部分人
it seems like he can take care
of the rest of them on his own.

155
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,053
呼叫Cowen首领
Radio chief Cowen.

156
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:04,223
告诉他派出增援部队, 一整个连
Tell him to send reinforcements, a full company.

157
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,185
如果你们希望Sheppard少校
If you 're hoping major Sheppard

158
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:10,062
可以让我们减员, 那就想错了
can diminish our numbers, you are mistaken.

159
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:25,036
OK. McKay将要做什么?
Okay. What would McKay do?

160
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,381
你的切入有点陡了, 博士
You're coming in a little steep, doc.

161
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,383
- 谢谢你, 中尉
- 我对这非常清楚
- Thank you, Lieutenant.
- I'm very aware of that.

162
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,719
我告诉过你不要玩那些惯性阀
I told you not to play with the inertial dampeners.

163
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,387
我非常确信我已经把它们都拨回去了
I'm pretty sure I got them back where they were.

164
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,306
你为什么不尝试联系一下少校?
Why don't you try to contact the major?

165
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,725
首先, 你必须让我们先进去
First, you got to get us in there.

166
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:09,872
你到底要干什么?
What are you up to?

167
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,173
他做了些什么?
What's he done now?

168
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,470
我本该预料到的
I should have seen this coming.

169
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,310
司令官
Commander.

170
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,855
Sheppard少校切断了控制室的电源
Major Sheppard has cut power to the control room.

171
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:35,523
他是怎么做的?
How?

172
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,695
Atlantis的电力由5个小型发电机提供
Atlantis is being powered by five small generators,

173
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,947
每个独立的为城市中的一部分供电
each responsible for a separate area of the city.

174
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:44,740
Sheppard刚刚停掉了
Major Sheppard has just disabled

175
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:48,077
为星际之门控制台供电的那台发电机
the one generator that powers
stargate operations in this tower.

176
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:51,831
现在, 我们仍然可以进行一些主要的操作
Now, we still have most primary operations.

177
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:57,211
但我们完全失去了所有的次要的系统
We have definitely lost all secondary systems.

178
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,215
你还可以跟踪到Sheppard么?
Can you still track Sheppard?

179
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,510
不行
No.

180
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:08,264
那我们现在不知道他在哪了?
Then we have no idea where he is now.

181
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,640
是的, 长官
No, sir.

182
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:15,021
控制室安全么?
Is the control room secure?

183
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,772
是的, 长官
Yes, commander.

184
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:20,401
我建议让一些人去守住剩下的那些发电机
I suggest we send some men to guard
the remaining generators.

185
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:21,152
不行!
No!

186
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:23,529
他正想把我们分开, 这样好逐一消灭
He's trying to divide us into manageable numbers.

187
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,615
守住星际之门的控制台
Just hold stargate operations

188
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,825
直到增援赶到
until the reinforcements arrive.

189
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:28,910
明白
Understood.

190
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,589
如果他问起是什么要干这么久
If he asks what's taking so long,

191
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:43,090
你就去告诉他刚才所说的, 好么?
you have to do all the talking, okay?

192
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,133
你会没事的
You'll be fine.

193
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:45,259
不, 不, 我不会
No, no, I won't.

194
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:48,137
我干骗人这行不行
我不会去冒险的
I'm a terrible bluffer.
I've lost small fortunes at poker.

195
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:51,390
我的眼睛会跳. 笑起来也不自然.
这都不好
My eye twitches. I laugh inappropriately.
It's not pretty.

196
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:52,850
进行得怎么样了?
What's our progress?

197
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:56,187
我们碰到了一点小麻烦
We've hit a small snag.

198
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:58,564
正在进行诊断
We're just running a diagnostic

199
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,108
以确定它可以正常传送我们的编码
to make sure we can interface our codes properly.

200
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,279
只是一个小麻烦, 小麻烦
It's a small snag, small snag.

201
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,198
好的, 听着, 最多半个小时
It's, like, half an hour at the most.

202
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:12,662
司令官, Sheppard刚刚停掉了另外一个发电机
Commander Sheppard has just disabled another generator.

203
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,664
是的, Ladon, 我知道了
Yes, Ladon, I am aware of that.

204
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:17,166
他切断了三号地下站的电源
He's cut the power to grounding station three.

205
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,710
这还能修好么?
Can it still be repaired?

206
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,883
没有电? 不行
Without power? No.

207
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:29,929
没有它, 计划可以完成么?
Can the plan be completed without it?

208
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:32,765
其他三个地下站已经停掉了
The other three grounding stations
have been disabled.

209
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,393
不, 不行, 这还不够
No. No, it's just not good enough.

210
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,020
看, 断开地下站
Look, by uncoupling the grounding stations,

211
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,939
这意味着当闪电击中这座城市的时候
it means that when lightning strikes the city,

212
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,149
电能将无处可去
the electricity will have nowhere to go.

213
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,527
如果我对这些电能加以合适的引导
If I could channel the electricity properly

214
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:47,405
它将会穿过城市中的走廊
through the conduits that line the city corridors,

215
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,323
我们也就可以给防护罩提供能量...
we should be able to power the shield...

216
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,950
临时性的
Temporarily.

217
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,286
如果这些地下站当中只要还有一个仍然接在上面
If any of these grounding stations are left active,

218
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:55,496
那么大量的电能
a sizable amount of electricity

219
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,124
就会通往地下, 我们也将没有防护罩
will find its way to ground and no shield.

220
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,672
司令官, 风暴并没有放慢脚步
Commander, the storm has not slowed its pace.

221
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,465
我们没有时间了, 必须立即让防护罩工作起来
We have little time to get the shields activated.

222
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,217
我们应该重新评估我们的目标, 或许
We should re-evaluate our goal. Perhaps.

223
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,762
我们仍然有足够的时间来实现我们的目标
We still have more than enough time
to complete our objectives.

224
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,055
所以, 我强烈建议
Then I must strongly advise

225
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:15,850
让人去修好那些停掉的发电机
that we send men down to repair
the deactivated generators

226
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:17,602
并且守好剩下可以工作的那几个
and to guard the remaining active ones.

227
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:19,103
同意, 兵分两路
Agreed, teams of two,

228
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:21,647
但我要你守好控制室
but I want you to watch over the control room.

229
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,399
直到增援到达
As soon as the reinforcements arrive,

230
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,360
并带领他们以压倒性的力量抓住Sheppard
have them take Sheppard with overwhelming force.

231
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:27,904
明白
Understood.

232
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,617
或许等一下我们就可以处于防护罩的保护之下了
Perhaps we can be under shelter while we wait.

233
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:34,744
到时我一定会感冒...
I'm liable to catch a cold like that...

234
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:40,082
我认了
I take it that's a "no."

235
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,016
呆在这儿, 不要动
Remain here and be still.

236
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:58,351
我会回来接你们的
I will return for you.

237
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:00,978
我们要去哪?
Where are we going?

238
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,146
军械库
Armory.

239
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:02,980
你确定...
Are you sure...

240
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,649
你知道, 你总是在说你不是一个军人
You know you're always saying you're not military,

241
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,067
- 你没有必要服从命令?
- Hi.
- you don't have to take orders?
- Hi.

242
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,486
现在你必须听我的
Now you do.

243
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,155
就当是暂时性的
So long as it's temporary.

244
00:17:21,664 --> 00:17:23,415
我们现在应该尝试联系少校么?
Should we try to contact the major now?

245
00:17:23,457 --> 00:17:25,125
Genii可能正在监听我们的频率
The Genii may be monitoring our frequencies.

246
00:17:25,251 --> 00:17:27,169
我不想通知他们我们已经到了
We do not want to alert them of our presence.

247
00:17:27,545 --> 00:17:29,171
生命信号探测仪
Life-signs detector.

248
00:17:30,214 --> 00:17:32,216
这些小点不会告诉我们谁是谁
These wee dots don't tell us much about who's who.

249
00:17:32,341 --> 00:17:33,968
我们怎么知道谁是少校?
How do we know which one's the major?

250
00:17:34,593 --> 00:17:36,512
如果有个小点除去了其他的点, 那就是他
He'll be the dot getting rid of the other dots.

251
00:17:36,971 --> 00:17:38,013
棒极了
Great.

252
00:18:01,662 --> 00:18:02,913
大概会来多少人?
How many should we expect?

253
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:04,832
一整个连, 60人或者更多
A full company, 60 or more.

254
00:18:06,584 --> 00:18:07,960
如果没有这么多人过来
I don't know how we were expected

255
00:18:08,002 --> 00:18:09,712
我们的处境就很难预料
to take a facility this size with any less.

256
00:18:09,879 --> 00:18:12,756
我们本来的计划只是进行一次突袭
找回本该属于我们的东西
It was supposed to be a raid
to retrieve what was rightfully ours.

257
00:18:15,009 --> 00:18:16,135
跟我来
With me.

258
00:18:16,677 --> 00:18:17,595
来吧
Come on.

259
00:18:24,727 --> 00:18:26,562
司令官, 增援到了
Reinforcements are arriving now, Commander.

260
00:18:27,646 --> 00:18:29,690
让他们守住星际之门操作台
Have them secure stargate operations

261
00:18:29,732 --> 00:18:31,317
然后向我汇报
and report back to me.

262
00:18:31,358 --> 00:18:32,193
是, 司令官
Yes, Commander.

263
00:18:38,282 --> 00:18:39,450
警戒这片区域
Secure the area.

264
00:18:39,491 --> 00:18:40,743
然后我要你们...
Then I want you to...

265
00:18:42,661 --> 00:18:44,330
把它关掉. Ladon!
Shut it off. Ladon!

266
00:18:44,872 --> 00:18:45,915
阻止他!
Stop him!

267
00:18:52,671 --> 00:18:53,506
我是Sora.
This is Sora.

268
00:18:53,547 --> 00:18:54,548
停止发送增援
Stop sending the reinforcements.

269
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:56,258
星际之门的防护罩已经打开了
The stargate shield has been raised.

270
00:18:57,968 --> 00:18:59,845
Sheppard打开了这个防护罩
Sheppard has raised the gate shield.

271
00:18:59,845 --> 00:19:01,305
把它关掉
Shut it down.

272
00:19:02,681 --> 00:19:03,641
把它关掉
Turn it off.

273
00:19:03,766 --> 00:19:04,725
我不知道怎么关
I don't know how.

274
00:19:04,767 --> 00:19:06,310
Ladon已经晕过去了
Ladon is unconscious.

275
00:19:06,477 --> 00:19:07,436
把程序告诉她
Tell her the procedure.

276
00:19:07,478 --> 00:19:08,604
不行, 我不知道他做了些什么!
I can't. I don't know what he's done!

277
00:19:08,646 --> 00:19:09,438
告诉她
Tell her.

278
00:19:09,605 --> 00:19:11,565
好吧, 他肯定是输入了他的个人命令码
Well, he must have entered
his personal command code.

279
00:19:11,607 --> 00:19:12,441
是什么?
What is it?

280
00:19:12,483 --> 00:19:13,234
我不知道!
I don't know!

281
00:19:13,275 --> 00:19:14,985
只有Sheppard自己知道
Only Sheppard would know it.

282
00:19:15,152 --> 00:19:16,654
相信我, 我没有那个胆
Trust me, I'm not that brave.

283
00:19:16,695 --> 00:19:18,239
如果可以, 我肯定会帮你的
I would help you if I could.

284
00:19:18,822 --> 00:19:20,032
你有那个命令码
You have the command codes.

285
00:19:26,121 --> 00:19:27,081
没有用
It's no use.

286
00:19:28,499 --> 00:19:30,042
已经完了
It's over.

287
00:19:34,797 --> 00:19:35,798
门已经关上了
The gate has shut down.

288
00:19:35,965 --> 00:19:37,758
不会再有人进来了
There are no more men coming.

289
00:19:39,134 --> 00:19:40,594
有多少人过来了?
How many men made it?

290
00:19:42,304 --> 00:19:43,347
五个
Five.

291
00:19:43,889 --> 00:19:45,891
60人中的5个
Five of 60.

292
00:19:55,442 --> 00:19:58,320
如果你想要这个城市, 你仍然需要我
You still need me if you want the city.

293
00:20:02,116 --> 00:20:03,993
你仍然需要我们
You still need both of us.

294
00:20:35,149 --> 00:20:37,985
他输入了某种安全码, 关掉了星际之门
He's entered some sort of security code
to lock down the gate.

295
00:20:38,736 --> 00:20:39,945
给我一些时间
Just give me some time.

296
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,447
我应该可以破解它
I should be able to crack it.

297
00:20:41,488 --> 00:20:42,489
快干
Do it.

298
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:44,408
司令官?
Commander?

299
00:20:45,034 --> 00:20:47,244
他说他可以修好星际之门
He thinks he can have the gate fixed.

300
00:20:48,537 --> 00:20:50,706
Athor的儿子通过了星际之门么?
Did Athor's son make it through the gate?

301
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,291
谁?
I'm sorry?

302
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,335
他的名字叫Idos.
His name is Idos.

303
00:20:54,668 --> 00:20:55,836
他过来了么?
Did he make it?

304
00:20:57,004 --> 00:20:58,214
没有, 长官
No, sir.

305
00:21:04,512 --> 00:21:06,430
死掉了60多个人
Over 60 men killed.

306
00:21:06,889 --> 00:21:10,809
保卫他的家园和他的人民
司令官, 正如我们期望的
Defending his home and his people,
Commander, as we would.

307
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,605
什么时候更多的增援能够发送过来?
When can more reinforcements be sent?

308
00:21:14,897 --> 00:21:16,565
这需要时间, 大概一个小时
It will take time, perhaps an hour.

309
00:21:16,607 --> 00:21:17,816
无法接受!
Unacceptable!

310
00:21:17,858 --> 00:21:20,110
是的, 司令官, 这无法接受
Yes, Commander, it is unacceptable,

311
00:21:20,236 --> 00:21:22,988
因为到了那时, 我们将会完全处于风暴之中了
because by then, we will be
in the full force of the storm.

312
00:21:23,531 --> 00:21:24,990
也许会更快
Probably sooner.

313
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,228
Sheppard少校, 我有一个建议想告诉你
Major Sheppard, I have a proposition for you.

314
00:21:57,898 --> 00:21:59,316
你听得出来这是谁的声音么?
Do you recognize that voice?

315
00:21:59,358 --> 00:22:00,067
不
No.

316
00:22:01,277 --> 00:22:04,655
Kolya, 我干得很辛苦啊
现在的分数是多少?
Kolya, I'm having a hard time keeping up.
What's the score again?

317
00:22:04,697 --> 00:22:07,950
我的人告诉我你不仅仅停掉了
一些至关紧要的发电机
My men have informed me that not only have you disabled

318
00:22:08,075 --> 00:22:11,662
而且还偷走了一些关键组件
some crucial generators,
but you've stolen key components

319
00:22:11,745 --> 00:22:14,290
没有它们, 发电机就无法重新运转
which make it impossible for them to be restored.

320
00:22:14,331 --> 00:22:15,791
是的, 是我做的
Yeah, I did that.

321
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:19,295
你的计划有两个缺陷
There are two flaws in your plan.

322
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:21,755
我非常乐意接受一些建设性的批评
I'm always open to constructive criticism.

323
00:22:22,882 --> 00:22:25,217
第一, 你假装让我相信
你宁可毁掉这个城市
One, the assumption I would believe

324
00:22:25,342 --> 00:22:29,263
也不愿让它落入我们之手
是非常幼稚的
you'd rather destroy the city
than let it fall to us is childish.

325
00:22:29,305 --> 00:22:30,890
听起来不像是我
Doesn't sound like me.

326
00:22:31,182 --> 00:22:35,686
第二, 如果并且当我意识到atlantis无法救回时
Second, if and when I determine atlantis unsalvageable,

327
00:22:35,728 --> 00:22:38,647
Weir博士和McKay就会不复存在
doctors Weir and McKay become obsolete.

328
00:22:40,232 --> 00:22:41,734
Weir还活着?
Weir is alive?

329
00:22:42,193 --> 00:22:45,779
McKay博士曾经尽了很大的努力让她活着
Dr. McKay was able to make
a strong case for keeping her alive.

330
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,406
让我跟她说话
Let me talk to her.

331
00:22:54,455 --> 00:22:55,414
Sheppard
Sheppard.

332
00:22:55,664 --> 00:22:57,082
我们都在这里
We're both here.

333
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,376
很高兴听到你的声音
It's good to hear your voice.

334
00:22:59,418 --> 00:23:01,086
是的, 很高兴能听到
Yeah, it's good to hear.

335
00:23:02,713 --> 00:23:06,008
在风暴完全到达之前
我们只剩下不到一个小时了
We have less than one hour
before the storm hits full-force.

336
00:23:06,258 --> 00:23:13,974
如果十分钟内, 三号地下站的电力仍然没有恢复的话
Weir将会死去
If the power is not returned to grounding station three
within the next 10 minutes, Dr. Weir dies.

337
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,311
又, 你是说?
Again, you mean.

338
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:20,272
他的死将会让你获得另外10分钟
Her death will buy you another 10 minutes,

339
00:23:20,314 --> 00:23:24,318
在那之后, 如果电仍然没有来
McKay博士也会死
after which, should the power still be out,
Dr. McKay dies.

340
00:23:24,443 --> 00:23:28,155
然后你将会和我们一起
直到这个城市被摧毁
We will then leave with what we can,
and the city will be destroyed.

341
00:23:28,322 --> 00:23:29,949
不行, 时间太短了
Well, that's not enough time.

342
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:32,117
如果你不介意毁掉Atlantis
If you don't mind destroying atlantis,

343
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,287
那么就在接下来的20分钟里, 呆在你现在所在的地方
stay where you are for the next 20 minutes.

344
00:23:35,496 --> 00:23:37,206
现在开始
Starting now.

345
00:23:45,506 --> 00:23:47,341
不要带得太多
这样就跑不快了
Don't load up so much.
It'll slow you down.

346
00:23:47,383 --> 00:23:49,051
没人再来两个弹夹
Two extra magazines each.

347
00:23:57,768 --> 00:23:58,853
好的
All right.

348
00:23:59,103 --> 00:24:00,271
你拿那做什么?
What do you need that for?

349
00:24:00,312 --> 00:24:02,523
我会朝任何移动的东西开枪
Anything I see moving is going to get shot.

350
00:24:02,606 --> 00:24:03,899
那么, 如果那时少校呢?
So, what if it's the major?

351
00:24:03,941 --> 00:24:06,193
那么它只会被击昏枪打中, 而不是p-90
Then he'll get hit with a wraith
stunner instead of a p-90.

352
00:24:06,861 --> 00:24:08,195
如果他先看到我们呢?
What if he sees us first?

353
00:24:08,237 --> 00:24:09,864
他可能会先听到你
He'll probably hear you first.

354
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:11,365
你是在告诉我又该住嘴么?
Are you telling me to shut up again?

355
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:12,658
再一次
Again.

356
00:24:17,663 --> 00:24:18,497
好吧
Right.

357
00:24:29,341 --> 00:24:30,384
我们走
Let's go.

358
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,519
哪台发电机会给第三地下站供电?
Which naquadah generator would power
the third grounding station?

359
00:24:40,561 --> 00:24:41,645
你在问我?
You're asking me?

360
00:24:41,687 --> 00:24:43,230
不管是哪台, 那里肯定有伏兵
Whichever one it is, it's going to be an ambush.

361
00:24:43,272 --> 00:24:44,356
不过我们仍然要去
We've got to be there.

362
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,441
那里有一个
There's one here.

363
00:24:45,482 --> 00:24:47,818
- 你是猜的么?
- 是的, 不过我感觉就是
- Is that a guess?
- Aye, but it makes sense.

364
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,986
这是最近的
It's the closest.

365
00:24:49,111 --> 00:24:50,070
好吧, 我开路
All right, I'll take point.

366
00:24:50,112 --> 00:24:51,155
Teyla, 你殿后
你...
Teyla, you're on our six.
You...

367
00:24:51,238 --> 00:24:53,073
我没有叫你就不要张嘴
Don't open your mouth until I say so.

368
00:24:53,157 --> 00:24:54,950
只朝我告诉你的目标开火
Only shoot at what I tell you to shoot at.

369
00:24:54,992 --> 00:24:56,327
你没有必要这么认真
You don't have to be so bloody pushy.

370
00:24:56,368 --> 00:24:57,620
这是命令
That's an order.

371
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:32,738
停
Stop.

372
00:25:36,116 --> 00:25:38,869
瞧, 你们老板要我把这玩意儿装回去
Look, your boss wanted me to turn this thing back on,

373
00:25:38,911 --> 00:25:40,621
我看我们应该照他说的去做
so I think we should do what he says.

374
00:25:40,871 --> 00:25:41,914
住嘴
Be quiet.

375
00:25:44,124 --> 00:25:45,084
Sora.
Sora.

376
00:25:45,125 --> 00:25:46,168
我们抓住他了
We have him.

377
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:47,294
别杀他
Keep him alive.

378
00:25:48,754 --> 00:25:50,297
我正过来
I'm on my way.

379
00:26:13,779 --> 00:26:15,239
难道不是这个?
Is it the wrong one?

380
00:26:15,322 --> 00:26:16,866
是的, 我正想这么说
Yeah, I'd say so.

381
00:26:17,032 --> 00:26:18,868
噢, 你该不会是在谴责我吧
Oh, don't you blame me for this.

382
00:26:18,951 --> 00:26:20,035
我不是工程师
I'm not an engineer.

383
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:22,371
对于Rodney和他的团队如何配置电源
I really only have a basic understanding
of how Rodney

384
00:26:22,413 --> 00:26:24,164
我也只有一些最基本的印象
所以, 不要指望我...
and his team configured the power,
so don't expect me...

385
00:26:24,206 --> 00:26:25,624
你能不能不说了, 好么?
You just can't stop talking, can you?

386
00:26:25,666 --> 00:26:27,751
我只是自己停不下来
不管我说的是什么...
You just can't help yourself.
No matter what I say...

387
00:26:27,793 --> 00:26:29,587
你这个伙计这么年轻
And you're such a nice young lad

388
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:31,589
现在却在那里发号施令
你这个厚颜无耻的小同性恋
until you're put in charge, you cheeky little bugger.

389
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:32,214
等等...
Wait...

390
00:26:32,256 --> 00:26:35,301
如果这个站点是对的
那么少校就是还没有让他恢复?
What if this is the right station,
and the major has not made it back yet?

391
00:26:37,011 --> 00:26:38,262
噢, 她是对的
Oh, she's right.

392
00:26:40,264 --> 00:26:43,017
不, 不, 这个发电机在工作
No. No, this one's working.

393
00:26:44,018 --> 00:26:45,269
还有多少时间?
How much time?

394
00:26:45,686 --> 00:26:46,687
两分钟
Two minutes.

395
00:26:46,937 --> 00:26:48,147
现在有5个发电机
There's five generators.

396
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:49,273
不是这个
It's not this one.

397
00:26:49,315 --> 00:26:51,108
也不是给控制塔提供能量的那个
It can't be the one that powers the control tower.

398
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:52,234
现在剩下三个
That leaves three.

399
00:26:52,985 --> 00:26:54,945
我们现在要从三个中把正确的那个选出来
We've got a one in three chance
of guessing the right one.

400
00:26:54,987 --> 00:26:57,031
我们可能正在步入真正的埋伏
We may just be walking into the very ambush

401
00:26:57,156 --> 00:26:58,490
我们正在试图将他从那里救出来
we're trying to save him from.

402
00:26:58,532 --> 00:26:59,700
我们离一个传送器不远
We're not far from a transporter.

403
00:26:59,742 --> 00:27:02,119
有哪个发电机离传送站比较近么?
Are any of the generators near a transport station?

404
00:27:02,244 --> 00:27:03,787
是的, 有两个
Aye. There's two.

405
00:27:04,455 --> 00:27:05,706
好的, 我们走
Well, let's go.

406
00:27:17,009 --> 00:27:18,677
OK, 如果我没记错的话...
Okay, if I remember correctly...

407
00:27:18,802 --> 00:27:19,970
好好想
Remember correctly.

408
00:27:20,095 --> 00:27:22,097
它们在这里和这里
I think they are here and here.

409
00:27:22,264 --> 00:27:24,141
你确定哪个是靠着发电机的?
Which one are you sure is next to a power generator?

410
00:27:24,183 --> 00:27:26,352
- OK, 给我一点时间
- 没时间了, 快选一个
- Okay, just give me a moment.
- No moments. Pick one.

411
00:27:26,393 --> 00:27:27,686
如果选错了, 你又要怪我
I'm the one you're going to blame if it's wrong.

412
00:27:27,686 --> 00:27:28,938
我们现在必须动身了
We have to go now.

413
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:32,983
这儿
Here.

414
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:38,405
我可不想成为一个被囚犯
I don't mean to be a bad prisoner or anything,

415
00:27:38,489 --> 00:27:39,949
不过如果我不按时把这个放回去
but Kolya is going to kill one of my people

416
00:27:40,032 --> 00:27:42,159
Kolya就会杀死一个我们的人, 所以...
if I don't get this thing back on in time, so...

417
00:27:42,201 --> 00:27:43,619
转过身来
Turn around.

418
00:27:54,755 --> 00:27:56,048
你们转过身去
You turn around.

419
00:27:56,507 --> 00:27:57,424
什么?
What?

420
00:27:58,133 --> 00:28:00,594
好吧, 如果我必须转过身来, 那你们也要转过身去
Well, if I have to turn around, you should turn around.

421
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:05,933
该死的你们怎么现在才来?
What the hell took you so long?

422
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:08,644
- 嗯, 还不是因为外面那个风暴...
- 好了, 别说了
- Well, there's this storm...
- Just hold that thought.

423
00:28:17,778 --> 00:28:20,114
看来Sheppard不想你死
It seems major Sheppard wants you to live.

424
00:28:20,781 --> 00:28:22,157
我们接着干活吧
Let's get back to work.

425
00:28:33,836 --> 00:28:34,795
你还好吧, 长官?
You okay, sir?

426
00:28:34,837 --> 00:28:36,547
比刚才好多了
I've been better. Been worse.

427
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:38,257
我的肩膀有点疼
My shoulder's a little sore.

428
00:28:38,382 --> 00:28:39,675
要我看看么?
Do you want me to take a look at that?

429
00:28:39,717 --> 00:28:41,093
等现在这事搞定之后再说吧
I'll take a recheck when that'll be out.

430
00:28:41,135 --> 00:28:43,262
我们应该离开这里
更多的Genii马上就会过来的
We should leave this area.
More Genii will be on their way.

431
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:44,722
太同意了
I couldn't agree more.

432
00:29:02,948 --> 00:29:04,408
如果还是不能工作...
If this doesn't work...

433
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:06,035
它会工作的
It will.

434
00:29:06,076 --> 00:29:07,369
我只是说, 如果它不能工作...
I'm just saying, if it doesn't work...

435
00:29:07,411 --> 00:29:08,495
它会的
It will.

436
00:29:08,537 --> 00:29:11,457
我相信它会的
但仍然有可能他不能工作...
I'm sure it will,
but in the unlikely event that it doesn't...

437
00:29:11,498 --> 00:29:12,791
Rodney...
Rodney...

438
00:29:14,793 --> 00:29:16,045
求你了
Please.

439
00:29:48,994 --> 00:29:50,162
妙极了
Fantastic.

440
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:51,914
噢, 感谢上帝
Oh, thank god.

441
00:29:57,753 --> 00:30:00,631
Mckay 认为他可以驾驭风暴中的闪电用来打开防护罩
Mckay figures he can harness
the storm's lightning to fire up the shield.

442
00:30:00,714 --> 00:30:01,966
只用闪电?
Just lightning?

443
00:30:02,007 --> 00:30:04,093
在此之前SG Team也曾经用过闪电为星际之门提供能量
SG teams have done it before to power a stargate.

444
00:30:04,176 --> 00:30:05,511
毕竟星际之门和防护罩还是有很大不同的...
There's a big difference between a stargate...

445
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:06,971
我没有说你可以讲话了
I didn't say you could talk.

446
00:30:13,602 --> 00:30:14,436
现在...
Now...

447
00:30:15,729 --> 00:30:18,107
我需要运行一个子程序来构建一个
I need to run the subroutine that will convince

448
00:30:18,148 --> 00:30:20,317
防护罩发生器的输入缓冲区
the input buffers in the shield generator

449
00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:22,695
将原始的电能削弱成为可用的能量
to attenuate the raw electricity into usable power.

450
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:24,989
这个我只能在控制室里完成
I can only do that from the control room.

451
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:27,199
而Weir也将在那里输入她的口令
That's where Dr. Weir's codes come in.

452
00:30:27,533 --> 00:30:28,576
好的
Yes.

453
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:31,287
只有主系统可以操作
Only primary systems are operating.

454
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:33,289
Sheppard必须修复另外一个发电机
Sheppard has to repair the other generator.

455
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:36,041
防护罩属于主系统
The shield's considered a primary system.

456
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:40,254
我们可以走了, 但我们必须现在就走
我是说现在
We're good to go, but we have to go now, I mean now.

457
00:30:40,379 --> 00:30:42,047
我的意思是所有人, 所有你的人
I mean everybody, all your men.

458
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:44,550
为什么我的人也必须走?
What does that have to do with my men?

459
00:30:44,842 --> 00:30:47,553
现在地下站已经被停用了
Now that the grounding station's been deactivated,

460
00:30:47,636 --> 00:30:49,805
电流将会在导管中自由流动
electricity will be free to flow through the conduits

461
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:52,433
那将包括这个城市中的所有走廊
that line every corridor in the city.

462
00:30:52,683 --> 00:30:54,018
这到底是个什么类型的计划?
What kind of a plan is that?

463
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:55,603
Rodney McKay类型的计划
A Rodney McKay kind of plan.

464
00:30:55,644 --> 00:30:56,770
我们知道的也就是这些
It's all we've got.

465
00:30:56,812 --> 00:30:58,439
而且我们只有一个地方可以去
And it leaves us only one place to go.

466
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,566
而Genii也将会去那里
Where the Genii will also be.

467
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:04,695
现在, 控制室和星际之门将会受到防御
Now, the control room and
stargate operations are shielded,

468
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,614
但城市的其它部分...
but the rest of the city...

469
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,658
一旦闪电开始击中...
Once the lightning starts to hit...

470
00:31:10,075 --> 00:31:12,578
任何留在走廊中的人都会死
Anybody left in the hallways is as good as dead.

471
00:31:29,887 --> 00:31:31,138
你怎么没有回答?
Why haven't you responded?

472
00:31:31,263 --> 00:31:32,515
她在这儿, 司令官
She's here, Commander.

473
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,265
谁?
Who?

474
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:35,809
Teyla. 和另外两个人加入了Sheppard.
Teyla. She and two others have joined Sheppard.

475
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:37,520
为什么不早点报告?
Why wasn't this reported sooner?

476
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:40,189
迅速撤离到控制室
Fall back to the control room immediately.

477
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:41,941
她刚刚才走开
She's just out of my reach.

478
00:31:42,149 --> 00:31:43,317
如果我有耐心的话...
If I am patient...

479
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:44,652
我在命令你
I gave you an order.

480
00:31:44,902 --> 00:31:46,820
她丢下了我的父亲, 让他等死
She left my father for dead.

481
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:49,281
风暴已经降临了, 对我们来说城市已经不安全了
The storm is upon us. The city is no longer safe.

482
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:50,449
我不管
I don't care.

483
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:51,450
快回来
Fall back.

484
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,702
我向你发誓, 你父亲的仇一定会报的
You have my word. Your father will be avenged.

485
00:31:53,911 --> 00:31:56,413
- 通过我
- Sora
- By me.
- Sora

486
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,962
那些年轻的猎人们在飞船里安全么?
Will the young hunters in the jumper be safe?

487
00:32:03,003 --> 00:32:04,839
空港是星际之门操作区的一部分
The jumper bay's part of stargate operations.

488
00:32:05,005 --> 00:32:06,048
他们会得到保护的
They'll be protected.

489
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,466
他我们可能也该去那里
Then maybe that's where we should be headed.

490
00:32:07,633 --> 00:32:10,344
如果防护罩在城市上空升起
Weir和McKay可能会因为Kolya而死
If the shield goes up over the city,
Weir and McKay are expendable to Kolya.

491
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:12,221
我们应该首先去占领控制室
We got to take the control room first.

492
00:32:12,304 --> 00:32:14,640
他仅仅会因为他们没有用而杀了他们么？
Would he really kill them just because
they are of no further use to him?

493
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:16,350
不, 他会杀了他们来惩罚我
No, he'd kill them to punish me.

494
00:32:16,892 --> 00:32:18,143
好, 现在的任务是...
Now, here's the deal...

495
00:32:18,352 --> 00:32:20,938
我和Ford到控制室的楼梯下占好位置
Ford and I get into position,
just below the control room stairs.

496
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,523
Teyla和Beckett赶往空港
Teyla and Beckett head to the jumper bay.

497
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:23,983
我想和你并肩作战...
I intend to fight alongside you...

498
00:32:24,024 --> 00:32:25,693
我也需要你和我一起作战
and I intend you to fight with us.

499
00:32:25,776 --> 00:32:26,819
一旦你占据位置之后
Once you get in position,

500
00:32:26,944 --> 00:32:28,237
将飞船开进星际之门所在的房间
lower the ship into the gate room,

501
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,363
亮出武器
open the weapons pods.

502
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:32,157
这将会分散他们的注意力, 我和Ford也就可以进去
That should create enough distraction
for Ford and me to go in.

503
00:32:32,199 --> 00:32:34,159
我们夺回控制室, 然后升起防护罩
We take back the control room, get the shield up.

504
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:35,119
城市获救了
City's saved.

505
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:36,537
Weir和McKay也将获救
Weir and McKay saved.

506
00:32:37,371 --> 00:32:39,039
我们一起度过剩下的日子
We take the rest of the day off.

507
00:32:39,373 --> 00:32:40,708
听起来像是一个计划, 长官
Sounds like a plan, sir.

508
00:32:40,791 --> 00:32:42,877
切换到二频道, 我们走
Stay on channel two. Let's move out.

509
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,712
我们不需要这个东西了
You're not going to need that thing.

510
00:32:45,212 --> 00:32:46,422
见一个杀一个
Shoot to kill.

511
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:55,723
风越来越猛烈了
The winds are getting stronger

512
00:32:55,764 --> 00:32:57,474
海浪也越来越高了
and the wave heights are growing.

513
00:32:58,309 --> 00:32:59,476
我们需要继续拖延时间
We need to keep stalling.

514
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:00,561
为什么?
What for?

515
00:33:00,769 --> 00:33:02,646
Sheppard还不知道在哪里
Major Sheppard is still out there.

516
00:33:02,688 --> 00:33:03,480
如果你启动...
If you activate...

517
00:33:03,522 --> 00:33:04,398
现在, McKay.
Now, McKay.

518
00:33:04,523 --> 00:33:05,441
好了
It's done.

519
00:33:05,482 --> 00:33:07,151
Weir博士, 现在我需要你输入你的密码
Dr. Weir, I need you to enter your code now.

520
00:33:08,777 --> 00:33:10,154
好的, 当然
Yes, of course.

521
00:33:11,947 --> 00:33:16,035
7, 9... 4, 2, 1
Seven, nine... Four, two, one.

522
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:17,703
继续
Yes?

523
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:22,082
0, 3, 2, 4, 5
Zero, three, two, four, five.

524
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:23,792
序列2?
And the second sequence?

525
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:31,884
我很高兴如果接下来的任务完成了...
I'll be glad when
this following-orders business is over...

526
00:33:35,012 --> 00:33:36,055
丢掉它!
Drop it!

527
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:38,933
否则我杀了他
I'll kill him.

528
00:33:48,275 --> 00:33:50,319
我不想这么快就杀了你
I would hate to kill you so quickly.

529
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:54,490
自从你生下来我就认识你了
I have known you for almost all your life.

530
00:33:54,573 --> 00:33:55,783
你为什么要这么做?
Why are you doing this?

531
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:57,159
你留下他等死...
You left him to die...

532
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,536
你父亲杀了一个无辜的人
Your father killed an innocent.

533
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:00,371
是他把我们的行踪暴露给了幽灵
He alerted the wraith to our presence.

534
00:34:00,454 --> 00:34:01,830
然后你就逃离了?
And you escaped.

535
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:04,375
如果我死于你手, Sora...
If I am to die by your hand, Sora...

536
00:34:04,458 --> 00:34:06,085
那么至死我也相信
I die knowing there was nothing

537
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,295
我没有任何办法可以救Tyrus.
I could have done to have saved Tyrus.

538
00:34:15,302 --> 00:34:16,470
我们就位了
We're in position.

539
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:20,891
有点不对劲
This isn't right.

540
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:23,060
什么?
What?

541
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:26,313
Teyla和Beckett应该会先到达空港
Teyla and Beckett should have
easily made it to the jumper bay first.

542
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,982
应该是他们在等我们
They should have been waiting for us.

543
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:30,317
Teyla, 你在哪里?
Teyla, what's your position?

544
00:34:32,611 --> 00:34:33,571
Teyla?
Teyla?

545
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:38,200
这是我父亲的
This was my father's.

546
00:34:38,784 --> 00:34:41,287
这是从他的父亲手里传下来的
It was handed down from his father.

547
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:46,458
如果你想以这种方式打假, Sora, 获胜的是我
If you want to fight this way, Sora, I will win.

548
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:48,419
你将不会为任何人报仇
You will have avenged no one.

549
00:34:50,087 --> 00:34:51,380
那我们就来吧
We'll see.

550
00:35:03,225 --> 00:35:04,435
启动防护罩
Engage the shield.

551
00:35:04,476 --> 00:35:05,728
快完了
I'm almost finished.

552
00:35:06,103 --> 00:35:08,230
一排巨浪正从西边逼近我们
A massive wave is approaching from the west.

553
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:09,440
如果没有防护罩...
Without the shield...

554
00:35:09,481 --> 00:35:10,357
McKay!
McKay!

555
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:16,572
已经有闪电击中北面的平台了
We're starting to get hits on the northern pier.

556
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,866
将电能导向走廊... 现在
Routing power to the corridor... Now.

557
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:23,120
现在
Now.

558
00:35:25,664 --> 00:35:26,582
现在
Now.

559
00:35:29,543 --> 00:35:30,878
OK, 现在有一个问题
Okay, this is a problem.

560
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,755
什么?
What?

561
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:35,674
瞧, 我告诉过你
这只是一个很少机会成功的尝试
Look, I told you this was
a long shot from the beginning.

562
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,802
洪水已经漫上北面和西面的平台了
We already have serious flooding
on the north and west piers.

563
00:35:38,844 --> 00:35:42,014
这没有用
城市的导管无法处理这种类型的原始能量
It's no use. The city conduits
can't handle this kind of raw power.

564
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:44,058
有能量被送往防护罩发生器么?
Is any power getting to the shield generator?

565
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:45,726
完全没有
Nominal amounts. Nowhere near enough.

566
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:46,894
你是说这会奏效
You said this would work.

567
00:35:46,977 --> 00:35:49,522
我不知道你注意到没有,
我并不是一个自大的人
I don't know if you noticed or not,
but I am extremely arrogant man

568
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:52,107
是谁认为他的计划会工作
who tends to think all of his plans will work.

569
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:55,528
白痴!
Idiot!

570
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:57,738
Hey, 这至多只是一个很少机会成功的尝试
Hey, this was a long shot at best.

571
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:01,116
要不然我们为什么会疏散整个城市?
Why else would we evacuate the city?

572
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,702
如果这不能奏效
It was always our intention to dial out

573
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:05,371
我们会义无反顾的拨号出去
in case this didn't work.

574
00:36:06,705 --> 00:36:09,124
Atlantis坚持不了多久了
Within minutes, Atlantis will fail.

575
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:12,044
你可以离开并存活下来
You can leave and survive,

576
00:36:12,127 --> 00:36:14,088
要不你就将跟这座城市一起沉没
or you can go down with the city.

577
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:20,219
你自己选择
You choose.

578
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:05,931
我们没有获取足够的能量来开启防护罩
We're just not getting enough power
to the shield generators.

579
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:07,641
你真的愿意把你的人的生命
Are you really going to sacrifice the lives

580
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:10,519
寄托于这座城市不会完全毁灭
of all of your men on the off-chance that this city

581
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,521
这一极小的机会上么?
won't be completely destroyed?

582
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:18,569
打开星际之门
Open the stargate.

583
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:20,654
开始疏散剩下的人
Start evacuating the remaining men.

584
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:24,200
你做出了正确的决定
You're making the right decision.

585
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:25,659
你们要和我们一起走
You're coming with us.

586
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:26,785
什么?
What?

587
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:29,288
你们要为你们所做的一切为Genii人付出赔偿
You'll both serve the Genii
as payment for what you've done.

588
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:30,497
噢, 为了我们做的什么?
Oh, for what we've done?

589
00:37:59,109 --> 00:38:00,361
计划修改
Change of plan.

590
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,035
你去救McKay.
You got McKay.

591
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,453
认真地说, 这是不是一个好主意
Seriously, this is a bad idea.

592
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:11,497
你也看到了, 我的机会最后发生了什么
You saw what happened to my last plan.

593
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:12,581
这并不是...
This is not what...

594
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,131
你哪也去不了
You're not going anywhere.

595
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:27,179
如果你不放开她, 我就会开枪打你
I will shoot you if you don't let her go.

596
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,683
冒着伤害Weir博士的风险?
And risk hurting Dr. Weir?

597
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,479
我并没有瞄准她
I'm not aiming at her.

598
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:44,655
找到Teyla和Beckett. 一定要找到他们
Find Teyla and Beckett. Make sure that's all of them.

599
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,156
非常抱歉, 我不得不...
Sorry about that. I had to...

600
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:48,158
你还好吧?
You okay?

601
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:49,910
不好
No.

602
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:51,370
会好的. 来吧
You will be. Come on.

603
00:38:58,669 --> 00:38:59,795
等等! 你要做什么?
Wait! What are you doing?

604
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:01,672
我想我要启动防护罩
I thought I'd activate the shield and save the day.

605
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:02,840
你还在想什么?
You got something else in mind?

606
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:04,508
Teyla和Beckett仍然不知道在哪里
Teyla and Beckett are still out there.

607
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:05,676
跟踪系统不工作了
Tracking system's down.

608
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,553
有一个海啸正朝城市而来, 中尉
There's a tsunami headed towards the city, lieutenant.

609
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:09,513
在两分半钟之后, 我们就都会死了
In two and a half minutes, they're dead.

610
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,015
那我就给他们两分钟
Then we give them two minutes.

611
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,871
这不是你父亲想要的
This is not what your father would have wanted.

612
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:36,540
我们本来应该结成同盟...
Our people were destined to be allies...

613
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:38,709
Teyla和Beckett, 回到控制室来
Teyla and Beckett, fall back to the control room.

614
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:42,880
该结束了... 现在!
This must end... now!

615
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:44,757
那就结束吧
Then end it.

616
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,402
没有时间了
There's no more time.

617
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:07,571
我们要么失去他们, 要么就失去整个城市
We either lose them or we lose the city.

618
00:40:11,116 --> 00:40:12,243
Rodney, 启动!
Rodney, go!

619
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:13,494
正在启动
Going!

620
00:40:31,136 --> 00:40:32,221
发生什么事了?
What's happening?

621
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,890
启动了, 必须积攒足够的能量来启动防护罩
It's working, It just needs to build up
enough power for the shield to activate.

622
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:36,267
等一下
Wait for it.

623
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,317
Carson.
Carson.

624
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:46,485
Rodney.
Rodney.

625
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,487
你正巧看到了这个结局, huh?
You're just in time to see how this ends, huh?

626
00:40:56,453 --> 00:40:57,496
现在
Now.

627
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:10,718
干得好, Rodney.
Nice work, Rodney.

628
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:12,595
你曾经怀疑过我么?
Did you ever doubt me?

629
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,889
是的, 有好多次
Yes, several times.

630
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:17,474
我看到你找到了一个新朋友, Teyla.
I see you've made a new friend, Teyla.

631
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,073
你将会怎样对她?
What do you want to do with her?

632
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:34,909
现在还不知道
I don't know yet.

633
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,827
在接下来的日子里我们会一直看着她
We'll keep her locked up for the time being.

634
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:41,332
也许把她放回Genii可以帮助消除我们之间的紧张情绪
Maybe releasing her back to the Genii
would help ease tension between us.

635
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:43,417
你真是太乐观了. 你知道么?
You're extremely optimistic. You know that?

636
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:44,710
你这样认为么?
You think so?

637
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:46,337
每个人都回来了?
Everyone getting back okay?

638
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:47,796
看起来是这样
Looks like it.

639
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:49,548
我们的城市怎么样了?
How fares our city?

640
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:51,926
嗯, 我们已经开始抽排底层的水了
Well, we've begun pumping out the lower levels

641
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,677
在东边的平台, 被水淹的那个
of the east pier, which was flooded.

642
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:55,513
有一些结构性的损坏
不过都不太严重
There is structural damage, nothing too serious.

643
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,806
Beckett有轻微的脑震荡
Beckett's suffered from a minor concussion.

644
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,892
我的意思是, 看这个, 我自己干的
I mean, look at this. I had to do this myself.

645
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:03,854
在好的方面, 我已经进行了24小时以来第一次正式的进餐了
Still, on the bright side,
I've had my first decent meal in 24 hours,

646
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:06,690
因此总体来说, 我想说我们都还好
so all things considered, I would say we are just fine.

647
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,944
你说这种事情每20年就会发生一次, 是么?
You say these things happen every 20 years, right?

648
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,403
那是他们说的
That's what they tell us.

649
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:14,907
那距离下一次还有多久?


How far in advance can we book days off?
