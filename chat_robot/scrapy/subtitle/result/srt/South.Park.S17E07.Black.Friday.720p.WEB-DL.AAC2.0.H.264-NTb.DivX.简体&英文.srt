南方公园  第十七季第七集
黑色星期五

13
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:17,950
I'm going down to south park
 gonna have myself a time

14
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,240
Friendly faces everywhere
 humble folks without temptation

15
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,170
Going down to south park
 gonna leave my woes behind

16
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,940
Ample parking day or night
 people shouting howdy neighbor

17
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,680
Heading on out to south park
 gonna see if I can't unwind

18
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:34,550
I like girls with big vaginas
 I like girls with big fat titties

19
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,800
Come on down to south park 
and meet some friends of mine.

20
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:44,260
黑色星期五
11月29日
南方公园商场

21
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:59,590
黑色星期五促销
凛冬将至

22
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,180
到了节日季
The holiday season is here.

23
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:50,370
黑色星期五也不远了
And Black Friday is upon us.

24
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,950
要知道  黑色星期五那天
As you know, Black Friday is the day

25
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,870
顾客会因假日促销暴走
shoppers go berserk for holiday deals.

26
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,550
去年26人遇难
Last year 26 people died

27
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:03,230
461人受重伤
and 461 were seriously injured.

28
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,370
今年冬天  商场向前20位来店顾客
This winter, the mall is offering 80% off

29
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,570
给出2折优惠
to the first 20 people in the store.

30
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:15,100
你们这些新来的应聘这份工作
For you new recruits perhaps you took this job

31
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,590
或许只想见见世面
to see just what the balance was like

32
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:18,950
或许你觉得
or perhaps you thought

33
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:21,580
黑色星期五上班没啥大不了的
working Black Friday wouldn't be a big deal.

34
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,820
我不过是想节假日赚点外快
I'm just trying to earn extra holiday cash.

35
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,780
或许你太蠢了
Or maybe you're too stupid to

36
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,090
都没意识到自己跳进了火坑
realize what you've gotten yourself into.

37
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,130
够了
That's enough.

38
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,790
我们今年只有齐心协力才能
Our only chance to survive in this year's sale

39
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,340
在这场促销浩劫中存活下来
is by sticking together.

40
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:41,040
你们应征入伍值得表扬  不过我警告你们
Those of you who signed up are to be commended but I warn you,

41
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:44,400
千万不要低估门外
do not underestimate the battle that's

42
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,280
即将到来的恶战
about to take place outside those doors.

43
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,650
凛冬将至
Winter is coming.

44
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:08,960
晚上好  先生
Good evening, sir.

45
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,420
我在召集所有的战士
I'm calling together all the fighters of Zaron.

46
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,660
我有事要和麦考米克夫人谈
I need to speak with Lady McCormick.

47
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,680
她现在不在
She's not here right now.

48
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,310
请转告她来参加大礼堂的会议
Please tell her there's to be a meeting in the great hall.

49
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,860
我已经想到抢XBOX的方法了
I have found a way to get Xbox ones

50
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,500
尊敬的麦考米克夫人应该会感兴趣的
and the Fair Lady McCormick will want to hear about it.

51
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,750
感谢各位的到来
Thank you all for coming.

52
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:31,910
托肯王子
Prince Token,

53
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,710
黑湖的蒂米爵士
Sir Timmy of Blacklake,

54
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:35,630
麦考米克夫人
Lady McCormick.

55
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:40,960
勇士们  我们曾无数次并肩作战
Warriors, we have fought many great battles together

56
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,720
在克莱德家  在斯考特・梅尔・金森家
at Clyde's house, and Scott Mel Kinson's House.

57
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,260
不过我们马上就要展开
But soon we'll be fighting

58
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,120
一场有生以来最惨烈的战斗
the greatest battle of our young hard lives.

59
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,810
凛冬将至
Winter is coming.

60
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,720
新一代游戏设备又将纷纷上架
And the next gen gaming devices are hitting the shelves.

61
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,210
可没人买得起
Which nobody can afford.

62
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,740
要是我跟你们说  如果我们齐心合力
What if I would tell you that we all work together

63
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:58,290
就有办法搞到新一代的游戏机
there's a way we can get the new gaming system?

64
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,170
巫师  如果你有办法就说出来
If you know of a way, Wizard, then speak.

65
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,470
我在工作中学会了一种黑魔法
I've learned of a dark magic at work.

66
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,240
感恩节过后的第一天
The day after Thanksgiving,

67
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,490
前30位进商场的将获得全场2折优惠
the first 30 people inside the mall get 80% off whatever they want.

68
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,700
他们称之为黑色星期五
They're calling it Black Friday.

69
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,950
好怕怕
Woo, Spooky.

70
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,560
黑色星期五
Black Friday?

71
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,320
拜托  没那回事儿
Come on, that can't be real.

72
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,550
真有  克雷格  
It is real, Craig,

73
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,850
我在新闻上看到的  混蛋
I saw it on the news, butthole.

74
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:22,790
真有其事
It is real.

75
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,060
每年都有
They do it every year,

76
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,960
可全城上下都想在黑色星期五
but Everyone in town tries to be

77
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,980
第一个挤进商场
the first inside the mall on Black Friday.

78
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,070
我们胜算有多大
What chance do we have?

79
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,450
纯靠我们自己  没可能
On our own, none.

80
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:32,280
但只要计划周密  深谋远虑  合力奋战
But if we plan, strategize and fight together,

81
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:34,830
我们就能成为黑色星期五第一批进去的人
we could be the first people inside on Black Friday.

82
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,140
然后凭着2折优惠得到我们用来救命的
And use the 80% to get the gaming system we need

83
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,370
游戏机
to survive.

84
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:42,590
感恩节快到了  我们都知道这意味着什么
Well, it's almost Thanksgiving and we all know what that means.

85
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,330
没错  黑色星期五即将到来
That's right, Black Friday is just around the corner.

86
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:45,950
艾玛
Ouch.

87
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,080
大家都摩拳擦掌  跃跃欲试
And people are already gearing up.

88
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:51,500
我们通常凌晨3点就来排队了
We usually start lining up around 3 a.m..

89
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:54,160
我们把自己浑身浸满猪血
We douse ourselves in pig blood

90
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,620
因为这样能在开门的时候助我们滑过人群
because it does help us slip threw the crowd when the doors open.

91
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,340
我们每年都来  算是家庭传统了
We do it every year, part of the family tradition.

92
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,340
去年我们不幸失去了最小的女儿
Last year we lost our youngest daughter.

93
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,760
她的脑袋被踩了个稀巴烂
Her head was stepped on and crushed.

94
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,980
不过为了纪念她  我们今年打算找个
But in her memory we're going to find a young girl

95
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,790
小女孩  踩她的头
and step on her head this year.

96
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:12,200
要是有人以为 他们能在商场里打败我
If anyone thinks they're gonna beat me inside that mall

97
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,940
妨碍我给孩子们买圣诞礼物
and keep me from getting my kids' christmas presents,

98
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,320
你丫想都别想
they can kiss my fat vagina,

99
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,150
因为我会让他们生不如死
coz I'm bringing the motherfucking pain.

100
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,760
南方公园商场的汤姆说
Tom, the south park mall says,

101
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,110
他们已经加强保安戒备
they've beefed up security

102
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:27,330
力求减少今年死亡人数
in an effort to reduce the number of fatalities this year

103
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:32,000
可以肯定的是人们十分重视黑色星期五
One thing's for sure, people take Black Friday very seriously.

104
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:45,240
对  对  非常好  很好
Yes, yes. Very nice. Good.

105
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,820
卡特曼巫师  网上有消息  大人
Wizard Cartman, I have news from the internet, my lord.

106
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,980
《权力的游戏》里面的人不兴敬礼  巴特斯
They don't salute in Game of Thrones, Butters.

107
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,410
抱歉  我还没看过
Sorry, I haven't watched it yet.

108
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:55,810
这样啊  那你要赶紧看了  哎呀太好了
OK. You need to start immediately please. Ah, very good!

109
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,280
灰鹰家族同意加入我们的战斗了
The House of Grayhawk has agreed to join our fight.

110
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,620
灰鹰家族
The House of Grayhawk?

111
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,020
玛丽安・布莱茨多斯基
Marian Bryostowski.

112
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,850
可是我的朋友 我们还得继续寻找其他
But my friends, we must still find others

113
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,040
愿意同我们并肩战斗的人
who will fight by our side.

114
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,130
还有没有别的没分派的人  能来帮帮我们
Are there no other factions we can call to our aid?

115
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:06,910
我知道
I know,

116
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,430
要不我们问问那些玩星际迷航的孩子吧
how about we ask those kids who play Star Trek?

117
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:11,740
才不要  去他妈的
No, screw those guys.

118
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,700
全是呆子  我才不要跟他们玩
They're dorks and I'm not playing with them.

119
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,420
我正想来点呢
Hey, that's what I'm talking about.

120
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,950
还有吗
You got any extra of that?

121
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,100
谢谢
Oh, thanks.

122
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,640
这里有点无聊了
Gets a little boring around here, you know.

123
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,500
趁现在好好享受无聊吧
Enjoy the boredom while you can.

124
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,000
你去年冬天也在这工作吗
So you worked here last winter?

125
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,460
黑色星期五也值班的吗
You worked on Black Friday.

126
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,500
是啊
I did.

127
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,740
有他们描述的那么糟糕吗
Is it really as bad as they say it is?

128
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,630
那些顾客
The shoppers

129
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:44,340
周四晚上便陆陆续续出现了
started showing up at midnight on Thursday.

130
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,670
他们没有排队
They didn't line up,

131
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:50,030
而是逐渐涌向正门
they just crammed themselves near the main entrance.

132
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,640
我能看见他们的脸贴在玻璃门上
I can see their faces smushed up against the glass

133
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,010
舔着舌头  等着进来
licking their lips waiting to get in.

134
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,550
天哪  他们发出的那些声音
God, the sounds they made.

135
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,810
5点商场门开了
It was 5 a.m. when they opened the doors.

136
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,780
到处都是尖叫声  到处都是血
There was screaming, blood,

137
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,900
人们互相撕扯着对方的脸
people tearing each other's faces off

138
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,070
节日的背景音乐放得正酣
while holiday music played in the background

139
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:14,170
我看见一个女人抓起她女儿的脚踝
I saw a woman pick up her daughter by the ankle

140
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:16,300
就往一老头头上甩
and swing her into some old guy's head.

141
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,870
我还没来得及反应  便被他们包围了
Before I knew it they were all around me,

142
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:20,390
人们争吵着  抢夺着
fighting, clawing.

143
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,930
后来一只手伸进来  把我一把揪了出来
Then a hand reached in and pulled me out.

144
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:26,320
头儿那天救了我们所有人
Old cap. He saved us all that day.

145
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:29,380
那天打烊后
When it was over,

146
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:32,230
商场前已经血流成河
in front of the mall was covered in red,

147
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,220
到处都是尸体  还有购物袋
bodies, shopping bags.

148
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,380
黑色星期五
前30名顾客的所有商品2折

149
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,810
现在  冬天又要来了
And now winter comes again.

150
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:45,070
卡特曼巫师  我开始看《权力的游戏》了
Wizard Cartman, I've started watching Game of Thrones.

151
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,050
很好  巴特斯圣骑士  你觉得好看吗
Ah, yes Paladin Butters, are you enjoying it?

152
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,660
我觉得挺不错的
Well, it's pretty good I guess.

153
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,200
但你有没注意到
But have you ever notice

154
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,010
每次里面露出某人的鸡鸡
that almost every time they show a guy's wiener,

155
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,850
那个角色就会搞基
that guy's character's a Gay.

156
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,870
你想要说什么
What do you mean?

157
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,940
里面出现有很多爆乳娘  宝器妹什么的
Just they have a lot of girls' boobs and vagina and stuff

158
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,520
但男人露鸡鸡的时候
but most times they show a man's wiener

159
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,960
大部分情况下都是在另一个男人演激情戏
is because that guy is in love scene with another guy.

160
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:01,700
你觉得这是因为
You think it's because

161
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,930
同性恋的鸡鸡对女性观众威胁比较小吗
gay wienner is less threatening to women viewers?

162
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,050
我觉得你根本没看到
I believe you might be missing

163
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,800
这部剧的重点  巴特斯圣骑士
the greater point of the show, Paladin Butters.

164
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,260
我知道的  凛冬将至啊
Yeah, I know. Winter's coming,

165
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,150
龙和丧尸们都跑出来了
and there're dragons and zombies on the way.

166
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,590
对此我倒是挺兴奋的
I'm pretty excited for that,

167
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,760
这样总算能少看点搞基的鸡鸡了
just can do with a little less gay wieners though.

168
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,510
幼儿园的那帮人给我们消息了
We have word from the kindergartners.

169
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,280
他们同意加入我们了
They've agreed to join us.

170
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,300
那些Xbox One是我们的了
Those Xbox Ones are as good as ours.

171
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:28,170
等等  Xbox One是什么意思
Wait, what are you talking about Xbox Ones?

172
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,300
这就是咱们的目标啊  克雷格
That's what this is all about, Craig.

173
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:30,840
咱们不就在努力争取
We're all trying to

174
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,570
黑色星期五那天买Xbox One嘛
get Xbox Ones on Black Friday.

175
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,890
我以为我们要买的是PS4
I thought we were getting Playstation 4s.

176
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:35,880
什么
What?

177
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,580
我也这么以为的
Me too.

178
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,010
不对  哥们儿
No, guys.

179
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:41,260
当我说我们要去弄下一代的游戏系统
When I said we are gonna get the next gen gaming systems

180
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,980
我显然说的是Xbox
I was obviously talking about Xboxes.

181
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,440
我想要PS4  而不是什么垃圾Xbox
I want a ps4, not a crappy Xbox.

182
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,350
听着伙计们  我们必须得达成共识
Look guys, we all have to agree on one system.

183
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,020
是这样的
That's right.

184
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,510
要是我们有人玩PS4
If some of us are on PS4s,

185
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,000
其他的玩Xbox
but rest of us on Xboxes,

186
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,970
那我们就没法一起联机了  明白吗
then we all can't play together online. See?

187
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,640
所以必须要用一种机器
This is all about commiting to one machine.

188
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,480
好吧  那就都买PS4
Right, let's all get PS4s.

189
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,630
不  Xbox更棒
No, the Xboxes are gonna be better.

190
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,370
它们才没有更好  它们只是更贵罢了
They're not better. They're just more expensive.

191
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:04,850
我们要买Xbox One
We're getting Xbox Ones, guys.

192
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,050
而且这是最终决定
And that is final.

193
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,620
Xbox玩家就是这样的
That's exectly how Xbox people are.

194
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,490
好吧
Fine.

195
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,690
要是你们不愿意黑色星期五
If you guys don't want to join us

196
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,790
跟我们一起去弄Xbox
on Black Friday to get Xboxes,

197
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,850
那就算了
then that's fine.

198
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,270
我们黑色星期五还是会去
We're still gonna fight on Black Friday

199
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,590
只不过不是和你们
just not with you.

200
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,910
看来非得如此了是吧
Oh, it's going to be like that is it?

201
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,380
想要PS4的人  加入我们这边
Everyone who wants to get PS4s, join with us.

202
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,220
我们不能就这样分裂
No, we can't divide like this.

203
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,040
斯坦  你是我们这边的  对吗
Stan, you're on our side, right?

204
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,640
我更喜欢PS4的手柄
I like the PS4's controller better.

205
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:42,160
斯坦  PS4不能和Xbox One一样
Stan, the PS4 doesn't have the seamless transition

206
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,370
在游戏动画和电视节目间无缝切换
between games' movies and TV offered by Xbox One.

207
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:47,970
但PS4的手柄上有触摸板啊
The PS4 controller has a touchpad interface.

208
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,860
你从来都听不进去
You never listened.

209
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,640
我说过我觉得PS4更好
I told you I thought the PS4 was better

210
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,530
但你从来不愿意听我的  凯尔
but you never wanted to listen to me, Kyle.

211
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,100
你太过想当然了
You just had your head so set because...

212
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,950
因为Xbox玩家就是这样的
because that's how Xbox people are.

213
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,130
那我们只有在黑色星期五见了
Then I guess I'll see you on Black Friday.

214
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,260
要是我在商场看到你了  凯尔
If I see you at the mall,Kyle,

215
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,410
我到时候不会手下留情的
I will have to try to beat you inside.

216
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,780
我知道
I know.

217
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:12,990
走吧  凯尔
Come on, kyle.

218
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,180
让这些索尼玩家
Let these sony fuckers

219
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,150
沉迷于语音控制都很次的游戏机里吧
wallow in their limit voice control functionality.

220
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,770
圣诞节要来啦
Christmas is coming.

221
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,510
鹅都变肥啦
Goose is getting fat.

222
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,910
你在做什么
What the hell are you doing?

223
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:36,000
莎朗  你起来了
Hey, Sharon, you're up, huh?

224
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:38,630
我  好吧  听着
I -- uh, all right, look.

225
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,590
我在商场找了份兼职
I took a temp job at the mall.

226
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,940
我只是想在节假日赚点外快
I just wanted to make extra holiday cash.

227
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,050
扯淡
Bubullshit.

228
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,970
莎朗  真的  我看到他们在招保安
I did, Sharon. I saw they were hiring extra security.

229
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:49,620
我就想这是个赚外快的好方法了
I thought it would be a good way to make money.

230
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,440
你这么做是为了在黑色星期五
You're doing this to try in getting in front of the line

231
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,140
能够排在前面  是吧
on Black Friday, aren't you?

232
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,400
别人可没这么认为  莎朗
Nobody else has thought of it, Sharon.

233
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,780
当大门打开时
I won't even be on the crowd,

234
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,020
我不会在人群中  我会在里面
I'll be on the inside when the doors open.

235
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,260
当大家把翔都快挤出来的时候
While everyone is trying to run over each other,

236
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,620
我会转头冲进商店里去
I'll turn around and run right into the stores.

237
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:08,010
我会是第一个进去买东西的人
I'll be the first to get whatever I want.

238
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:08,870
黑色星期五
Isn't Black Friday

239
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,510
不是意味着为别人买东西的吗
supposed to be about buying things for other people?

240
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,760
凛冬将至  莎朗
Winter's coming, Sharon.

241
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,970
而我是一只卑鄙的小蜜蜂
And I'm a sneaky little bee.

242
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,270
舰长  推力是20%
The thrust are at 20%, Captain.

243
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,340
接近  发射战争一号
Engage and send War Factor One.

244
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:29,400
舰长  埃里克・卡特曼发来通讯请求
Captain, we have an incoming facetime request by Eric Cartman.

245
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,630
切换到大屏幕上
On screen.

246
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,030
伙计们  忙啥呢
Hey guys, what's up?

247
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,730
没什么  我们正要检查一颗M级行星
Nothing mate, we're just about to check out a class M planet

248
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:36,610
看看上面有没有三锂化物资源
that might have new source of trilithium.

249
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:38,210
天呐  这些家伙太呆了
God, these guys are such dorks.

250
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:40,060
问他们站在哪一边
Find out who they're loyal to.

251
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,690
生生不息  繁荣昌盛
Yeah, live long and prosper.

252
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:44,250
伙计们  你们是Xbox玩家吧
Listen, guys, you're Xbox people, right?

253
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,590
尽管Xbox的帧率弱爆了
Even the Xbox sucks in framerate,

254
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,760
但我们还是只能说
we have no choice but to declare

255
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,040
它们从技术上讲最适合我们的星际舰队
they're most technologically fit for Star fleet.

256
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,850
天呐  他们太基佬了
Oh my god. They're so gay.

257
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:54,170
太棒了  那我告诉你们
Oh cool. What if I would tell you that

258
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:55,710
只要你们加入我们
we have a way for you to join us

259
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:58,050
就可以超低价买到Xbox One
and getting Xbox Ones super cheap?

260
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:59,160
便宜的Xbox One
Cheap Xbox Ones?

261
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,440
真的吗
For real?

262
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,800
联邦已经同意和我们并肩作战
The Federation has agreed to fight with us.

263
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,930
有了他们和幼儿园的那帮人
With them and the kindergartners

264
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,200
我们的队伍就有之前两倍大了
our army has just doubled in size.

265
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:11,350
你还是觉得你可以说服斯坦加入我们
You still think you can convince Stan to come back to our side,

266
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,700
是吗  凯尔爵士
don't you, Sir Kyle?

267
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,630
我不知道
I don't know.

268
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,240
你改变不了他的想法的  凯尔爵士
You can't change his mind, Sir Kyle.

269
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,200
索尼玩家是没有理性的
Sony people don't think with logic.

270
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,450
他背叛了我们
He betrayed us,

271
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,020
而现在我们必须通过建立强大的联盟
and now we must out Game of Thrones

272
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,840
来获取这场权力的游戏的胜利
by making powerful alliances.

273
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,280
别逼我开口
Don't get me started.

274
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,220
我一直在追剧
I keep watching that show, and I'm still waiting

275
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,090
一直在等那些龙出来发威
for the damn dragons to show up and kick everyone's butt,

276
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,280
但我只等到了各种小鸡鸡
but all I get is wiener, wiener, wiener.

277
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,510
也不全是基友的小鸡鸡
It's not all gay wiener,

278
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:35,180
但只要出现了直男的小鸡鸡
but when they do show a straight guy's wiener,

279
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,440
就全是又软又小的
it's all soft and floppy,

280
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,540
即使他妈的有个美女在面前
even when we just god damn have a pretty girl.

281
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,540
到底为啥
Why is that?

282
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,520
因为软鸡鸡没攻击力啊
Because the soft weiner isn't threatening.

283
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,490
就跟基友的鸡鸡一样
Just like a gay weiner.

284
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,690
巴特斯  你好像对鸡鸡有点痴狂
Butters, you seem to be somewhat obsessed with wieners?

285
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,070
我对鸡鸡痴狂嘛
I'm obsessed with weiners?

286
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,530
那对Xbox算啥
What about Xbo?

287
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:53,270
别捣乱  巴特斯
This isn't helping us, Butters.

288
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:55,230
索尼粉也许不是主要矛盾了
The Sony people might not be our biggest problem.

289
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,100
为啥
Why is that?

290
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,210
推特说圣诞将推出新的艾蒙玩偶
Twitter says they are introducing a new Elmo doll this Christmas.

292
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,640
节日里孩子们最想要什么礼物

293
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,600
佳节好礼品  隆重介绍别碰我艾蒙
Just in time for the holidays, it's "Stop touching me Elmo"

294
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,350
当你按压他的背部
When you press his back,

295
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,580
艾蒙会把手放在你的膝盖上说有趣的话
Elmo puts his hand on your knee, says fun things.

296
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,360
你大腿内侧被挠过痒痒嘛
Have you ever been tickled on the inside?

297
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,340
宝贝  宝贝  你寂寞么
Honey, honey, are you lonely?

298
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:18,820
我能看你尿尿嘛
Can I watch you go potty?

299
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,170
你想亲亲给艾蒙配音的人嘛
Do you want to kiss the guy who does Elmo's voice?

300
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,180
别碰我  艾蒙
Stop touching me, Elmo.

301
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:28,050
艾蒙还能用牙膏挤挤乐陪孩子们刷牙
Elmo also helps kids brush their teeth with his toothpaste dispenser.

302
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,830
千万别错过这个节日最热礼品哦
Don't miss out on this holiday season's biggest gift.

303
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,270
别碰我  艾蒙
Stop touching me, Elmo.

304
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:37,220

天啊  不
Oh, Christ, no.

313
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:57,300
这是谋杀啊  冷血禽兽
You've murdered us, you soulless monsters.

314
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,070
简直丧尽天良啊
You've killed us all.

315

上帝啊  他们已经开始排队了

00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,000
不是吧  这么早就开始排队

我来对付这帮禽兽

这是黑色星期五的专用队伍

324

329

我们来寻求你们的帮助
We come seeking your help.

330
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,960
你跟Xbox粉是一国的
Do you side with those wanting Xboxes

331
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,370
还是想加入我们为PS4而战
or will you join us on Black Friday and fight for PS4s?

332
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,560
你是认真的吗
Are you for real?

333
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,280
你们心知肚明PS4是更好的选择
You know that ther PS4s are the better choice.

334
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,310
这不明摆着嘛
I mean, come on.

335
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,170
我们当然选择PS4
Of course we're going with the PS4.

336
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,260
他们更黑一点
They're blacker.

337
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,380
那就加入我们
Then join us.

338
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:54,440
我们需要人手帮我们在前20名内冲进商场
We need people to help us be the first 20 inside the mall.

339
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:57,800
我们要等PS4更便宜更多货的时候
We are just gonna wait until the PS4s to be more cheaper and more available.

340
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,900
不  你们不能那样
No. You can't do that.

341
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,180
你们不  不  不能那样
You ca--ca--can't do that.

342
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,670
你们不明白这不仅关乎黑色星期五吗
Don't you see that this is more than Black Friday?

343
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,300
战线已被部署
Battle lines are being drawn.

344
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:08,000
等到最后别人都选择了Xbox
If you wait it out but everyone else has already decided to go with Xbox, then

345
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,660
它就成了标准
that will become the standard.

346
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,700
那PS4就跟Betamax败给VHS一样输了
The PS4 will be like Betamax was to VHS.

347
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,610
什么是Betamax
What's Betamax?

348
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:15,890
就像这样
Exactly.

349
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,440
什么是VHS
What's VHS?

350
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:20,620
听着  我们只是想让玩PS4的人
Look, we are just asking people who want to play on

351
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,840
为他们的信仰而战
PS4s to fight for what they believe in.

352
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,970
抱歉  我们就是漠不关心
Sorry, I guess we just don't care enough.

353
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,500
走吧  斯坦大人
Come on, Sir Stan.

354
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,610
一定有其他孩子会加入我们的
There must be kids somewhere who will join us.

355
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:39,440
麦考密克夫人  我想和你谈谈凯尔
Lady McKormick I was hoping I can talk to you about Kyle.

356
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,890
怎么了  公爵大人
Yeah. What is it, my Lord?

357
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,420
我不确定他心所向
I'm not sure if his heart is in the right place.

358
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:46,980
如果他叛变的话
If he were to ever switch sides,

359
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,290
斯坦军就对我们造成了威胁
it could make Stan's army problematic for us.

360
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:50,930
但凯尔只是无名小卒
But Kyle isn't anything.

361
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,420
没错  但我们不能让凯尔
True, but we can't let Kyle come

362
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,260
阻挡我们的正义之路
in the way of what's the right for the ours.

363
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,170
面对现实吧  麦考密克夫人
Let's face it, Lady McKormick.

364
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:58,750
这其实就只关于你和我得到Xbox One
This is really about you and me getting Xbox Ones.

365
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,000
其他人的存在只是为了
The others are simply there to

366
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,990
帮我们进入那几扇门罢了
help us get inside those doors.

367
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:04,640
的确
Yeah. That's right.

368
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,270
你对其他男人
You have a strong influence over

369
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:08,030
影响甚大  麦考密克夫人
the rest of the men, Lady McKormick.

370
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,580
当时机成熟
All I'm saying is when the time comes,

371
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:13,010
我也许需要借用你的影响力
I might need you to use that influence

372
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:15,280
来搞定凯尔
to have Kyle taken care of.

373
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,750
我们达成共识了吗
Do we understand each other?

374
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,460
很好  我想是的
Perfect. I think we do.

375
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:23,270
小屁孩  滚出我家后院
Hey, you damn kids, get the hell out of my yard.

376
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,120
草泥马  这是安得拉特斯的花园
Fuck you, dude. This is the garden of Andrax.

377
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,830
这他妈是我家花园
No, it's my damn garden.

378
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,280
我受够了你们这帮小屁孩在这
I'm sick of you kids dressing up and

379
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,350
过家家还探讨背叛
having talks of betrayal in it.

380
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,360
嗡嗡  嗡嗡  嗡嗡
Buzz, buzz, buzz.

381
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,240
70英寸的电视
70-inch television.

382
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,080
真不错  但是两折的电脑
That would be good but 80% off a computer.

383
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,580
也许两个都能到手
Maybe I will be able to snack both.

384
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,000
你还好吗
Doing alright there?

385
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:43,760
很好  长官
Yes, sir.

386
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,910
抱歉  我没想吓你
Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

387
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,340
没有  我只是在看这些
No, I was just looking at

388
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,460
我买不起的东西
all These great things I can't afford.

389
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:53,650
我知道你为什么找这个兼职
Listen, I know why you took this part-time job.

390
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:55,660
是  是吗
You--You do?

391
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:57,380
我能从你身上看到
I see it in you.

392
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,310
你关心他人
You care about people.

393
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,870
我也是  所以我每年都在这
Same reason I do it every year.

394
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:04,170
你让我想起我儿子
You remind me of my son.

395
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,380
他死于89年的黑色星期五
He died on black Friday in '89.

396
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:09,610
大概我现在还想要救他
Guess I'm still trying to save him.

397
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,330
我只是想说  我...
Look, I just want to say I--

398
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,360
你这么做我非常感激
I really appreciate what you're doing.

399
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,990
我答应我老婆  
I promised my wife

400
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:18,650
这会是我最后一次在黑色星期五工作
this would be the last black Friday I worked.

401
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,990
当我看到你这样的人
When I see folks like you,

402
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,940
让我对人类的未来充满希望
it makes me hopeful that people will still be okay.

403
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,860
是  很好
Yeah, awesome.

404
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,810
妈的  不准在天鹅绒绳后面排队
Aw, damn it, no lining up behind the velvet rope.

405
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:31,700
他们就是不听
They just don't listen.

406
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,070
卡特曼的军队日渐强大
Cartman's army is getting bigger every day.

407
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,220
除了同盟孩子和幼儿园孩子
In addition to the federation and the kindergartners,

408
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,900
Xbox军队现在还拥有玩哈利・波特的孩子
the Xbox army now also has the kids who play Harry Potter,

409
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,740
运动员  游泳队以及合唱团
the jocks, the swim team, and the glee club.

410
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,420
有消息称六年级学生也都喜欢Xbox
Word is that the sixth graders all prefer Xbox too,

411
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,120
他们也会跟卡特曼组队
and will team up with Cartman as well.

412
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,760
那我们这边都有谁
And who do we have on our side?

413
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:01,560
除了我们  还有读书会和贾妮思・平克顿
Besides us, it's the book club and Janice Pinkerton.

414
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,530
你有问过吸血鬼小子们吗
Did you ask the vamp kids?

415
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:05,270
他们一直没定
They're still undecided.

416
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,060
一定有办法让中立的人加入我们这边
There has to be a way to get people on the fence to join our side.

417
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,150
PS
Playstation.

418
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:14,850
斯坦大人  或许该放弃了
Look, Sir Stan, it's probably time to give this up.

419
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:16,690
我们是将要灭亡的一代  斯坦
We're just a dying breed, Stan.

420
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:18,900
Xbox将会全盘通吃
Xbox is going to win this whole thing.

421
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,020
那我们就放任其他孩子决定
So we're just going to let other kids decide

422
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,140
我们用什么系统玩游戏吗
which game system we all play on?

423
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:25,590
《权力的游戏》中会怎么做
What would they do on Game of Thrones?

424
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:28,670
事情到了最黑暗的境地  他们会怎么做
What would they do when things look their darkest?

425
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:43,590
[日语]

426
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,260
很抱歉打扰您  先生
Sorry, to disturb you, sir,

427
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,690
但我们觉得你该看看这个
but we thought you should see this.

428
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,920
"凛冬将至"
"Winter is coming.

429
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,880
"选好队伍"
Choose side."

430
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,000
神马玩意

431
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,150
只是美国中部的一个小镇
Just a small town in middle America,

432
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,940
但很明显一场战争在不断升级
but apparently a war's escalating.

433
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,900
先生  如果这成为了新闻报道
Sir, if this were to become a news story,

434
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:12,060
而第一批进入商场的人都拿了Xbox
and if the first people inside that mall all got Xboxes,

435
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,700
会有损我们的企业形象
It clearly looks bad for our image.

436
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,220
这样哦

437
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:22,230
这个黑色星期五
What's going to be the big item

438
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:24,280
人人势在必得的大商品是什么
every one goes for this black Friday?

439
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:27,310
很可能是PS4
It just might be the Playstation 4.

440
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:29,110
索尼刚刚宣称他们将提供
Sony has just announced they're offering

441
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:31,380
一个黑色星期五特别礼包
a special black Friday bundle

442
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:34,020
叫做"黑涩星期五俚包"
called the "brack Friday bunduru",

443
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,120

00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:43,320
并且允许你自动提前预定《合金装备5》
and allow you to automatically preorder for Metal Gear Solid V.

446
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,800
毫无疑问索尼已经提高了筹码
No doubt Sony has just raised the stakes.

447
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,480
对  很好  同盟的孩子们
Yes. Good, federation kids.

448
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,890
你们在学习赤手搏斗
You're learning to fight with your hands.

449
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:52,680
继续努力  幼儿园孩子们
Keep pushing, kindergartners.

450
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,080
凯尔爵士  
Sir Kyle,

451
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,170
我知道索尼提供了黑色星期五俚包
I know that Sony's offering a special black Friday bunduru.

452
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:01,670
你清楚Xbox依然更好  对吧
You know the Xbox is still better, right?

453
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:03,070
对  但是Xbox为什么
Yeah, but why can't Xbox

454
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:05,830
不能让你自动提前预定《合金装备5》
automatically let you preorder Metal Gear Solid V?

455
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:08,800
凯尔爵士  提前预定毛都不能代表  好吗
Sir kyle, preorder doesn't mean shit, okay?

456
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,080
你提前预定一个游戏
When you preorder a game,

457
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,580
就等于你提前付钱给
you're just committing to paying for something

458
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,860
那些加州的混蛋们
that some assholes in California

459
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,520
还没有完工的项目

460
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,220
知道提前预定游戏得到的是什么吗
You know what you get for preordering a game?

461
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,710
往嘴里塞个大鸡巴
A big dick in your mouth.

462
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:19,330
黑色星期五  11月29日  南方公园商场

463
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,600
好了  听着
All right, listen up.

464
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,560
商场不再允许人们
The mall's no longer allowing people

465
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:29,170
在感恩节之前为黑色星期五排队
to line up for black Friday until Thanksgiving night.

466
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,060
没有关系
It's okay.

467
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:35,720
为保持先后次序  我们会发放手环
To hold places in line, we're handing out wristbands.

468
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,570
天哪  天哪

469
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:41,000
抢手环
Wristbands!

470
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,070
闪开  全都闪开
Back! Back all of you!

471
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,500
如果你们这幅德行  手环也不要发了
If that's how you are, there'll be no wristbands.

472
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,730
都走吧
Now go!

473
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,100
闪开
Back away.

474
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,890
我要给我儿子抢个埃尔莫娃娃  你这混蛋
I'm getting my son that Elmo doll, you fuck!

475
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,140
不
No.

476
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,490

重任就交给你了
The watch is yours now.

478
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,240
不  你不能死
No. You can't die.

479
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,490
所有人都很喜欢你
Everybody really likes you.

480
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:11,170
这是我们的使命
This is what we signed up for.

481
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,090
是吧  我的朋友
Right, my friend?

482
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,430
不  我骗了你
No, I was lying to you.

483
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:19,970
我做这份工作是为了在黑色星期五抢占前排
I took this job to be at the front of the line on black Friday.

484
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:24,240
现在你知道事情的严重性了
Now you know how serious this is.

485
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:28,800
不管你最初的意图是什么  保护这个小镇
Whatever your intentions before, protect this town.

486
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:31,820
现在你是头
You are in charge now.

487
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,500
拿着这个
Take this.

488
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:40,480
别让黑色星期五成为末日
Don't let black Friday be the end.

489
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:01,630
都进去  我们有工作要做
Get back inside. We have work to do.

490
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,410
我们发起这场战争
When we started this fight,

491
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,800
是因为而我们受够了
it was because we were tired of

492
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,560
玩Xbox的人跟我们说PS逊毙了
Xbox people telling us playstation sucked.

493
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:18,150
现在我们为自己战斗
Now we're an army of our own.

494
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,680
我无法保证你们能活着回来
I can't guarantee you will live,

495
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:27,190
但我可以保证在一切结束之前
but I can guarantee that before this is over,

496
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:30,680
游戏机之战的胜者将会见分晓
the winner of the console wars will be decided.

497
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,860
我们新任的领导者加入我们

498
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,030
以确保那个赢家是PS4

499
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:41,510
参见公主殿下
All hail the princess!

500
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:48,850
公主殿下
The princess.
