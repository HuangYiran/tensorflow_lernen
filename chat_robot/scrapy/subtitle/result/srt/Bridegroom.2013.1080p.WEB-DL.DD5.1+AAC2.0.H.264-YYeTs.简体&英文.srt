139
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,450
他感觉无法呼吸
He felt like he couldn't breathe.

140
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,210
我们不得不跟他说
And we would have to say,

141
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:12,270
"你得往头上套个袋子"
"You've got to put a sack over your head."

142
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:12,270
{\an8}吸入二氧化碳可以平衡恐慌发作时体内酸碱度  防止过度呼吸导致的呼吸性碱中毒

143
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,260
他不喜欢那样做
He didn't like doing it,

144
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:17,240
但如果是在我家  我们就会给他套个袋子
but when he was at my house, we put a sack over his head.

145
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,890
随着时间推移
So as time went on,

146
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,510
我会偷偷溜进家里的某间卧室
I would sneak into one of the bedrooms in our house

147
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:24,970
然后拨911  说我快死了
and I would dial 911 and tell them that I was dying.

148
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:25,790
突然间
And all of a sudden,

149
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:28,260
我看见车道上有很多灯在闪
I see these flashing lights in the driveway,

150
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,100
我就想  "出什么事了"
and I thought, "What is going on?"

151
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:33,070
我上楼之后  急救人员说
And I go upstairs, and here is the ambulance

152
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,180
家里有人遇到麻烦了
saying that somebody is in distress in this home.

153
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,320
有人噎住了  有人窒息了
Somebody was choking. Somebody was suffocating.

154
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,380
她就会说  "谢恩  该死的"
It led to her being like, you know, "Shane, god damn it!

155
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,870
"警察怎么又来了"
The cops are here again."

156
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:45,060
从他六年级开始一直到高中
From sixth grade, till I got that kid through high school,

157
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,810
我都不知道自己是怎么撑下来的
I didn't know if I was gonna survive.

158
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,330
我敢说他报了10到15次警
I bet 10, 15 times he called 911.

159
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,480
我花的钱
The money

160
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,910
那么多年来我在那上面花的钱
That it, you know, cost me through the years --

161
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:57,290
可以说是压力不小
It was very stressful.

162
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,160
但他的确很痛苦  我知道他很痛苦
But it was real to him, and I knew it was real to him,

163
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,600
我想要他有安全感
And I wanted him to feel he was safe.

164
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,460
她最终发现
She finally decided

165
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,470
状况已经严重到超出她能掌控的地步了
that this is maybe more serious than she can handle,

166
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,310
所以她带我去看了心理医生
so she set me up with a therapist.

167
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,030
等谢恩完成他的疗程之后
When Shane got done with his session,

168
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,450
医生把我叫进去  对我说
he asked me to come in, and he said,

169
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:17,180
"你儿子需要接受他是同性恋这个事实"
"Your son just needs to admit to himself that he's gay,

170
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,980
"一切都会好起来的"
and everything will be fine."

171
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:21,090
我说  "你怎么能这样说呢"
And I said, "How can you say that?

172
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,550
"他不是同性恋"
He's not gay."

173
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:25,950
豪瑟医生说  "那好吧"
And Doctor Hausser said, "Well, you know,

174
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,040
"看来你也需要坦然接受这个事实"
That's something you're gonna have to come to peace with."

175
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,970
我一直很怀疑  不骗你
I always suspected -- I'm not gonna lie to you.

176
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,140
我花了几天时间接受这个事实
It took me a couple days to process,

177
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,510
然后我就决定
and the thing it come down to is,

178
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,190
"我不会再要其他孩子了"
"I ain't making any more kids --

179
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,460
"我还是跟这几个孩子好好过吧"
I better stay in good with the ones I got."

180
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:42,270
我无条件地爱他  所以这并不重要
And I love him unconditionally, so it just doesn't matter.

181
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:45,710
有趣的是  当我还是个小孩子
It's kind of funny now that, here I was a little boy,

182
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:49,290
我跪在地上  向上帝祈祷自己不是同性恋
on my knees, praying to God that I wouldn't be gay,

183
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,940
与此同时有另外一个男孩
and there was another little boy

184
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:54,470
在2400公里以外的印第安纳做着同样的事
1,500 miles away in Indiana doing the same thing.

185
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:57,190

Knox, Indiana, is not the easiest place

186
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,060
长大很不容易
for a gay kid to grow up.

187
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:03,420
那里文化很单一  不够多元
It's very homogenous -- not much diversity there.

我认识汤姆
I knew Tom

190
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:08,470
是因为我俩的哥哥都曾当过童子军
when both of our brothers were in boy scouts together.

191
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,470

他就是那种人见人爱的孩子
And he was just the popular kid.

193
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,280
非常有同情心
He had a lot of empathy.

我永远不会忘记  我母亲去世那天

汤姆是第一个来我家的人
Tom was the first person to come over to my house.

196
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:23,720
他走进大门  哭哭啼啼的
He walked in the door, and he was crying --

197
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,050
好像他比我还伤心
You know, almost like he's sadder than I am.

都有各自的孩子
from previous marriages.

200
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,740
汤姆则是他俩唯一共同生下的孩子
So, Tom was the only child between the two parents,

201
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,920
是全家人的掌上明珠
and he was the center of attention in the family.

202
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,780
他到哪都是焦点人物
He was the center of attention everywhere he was.

总是在表现自己
and he was always performing.

211
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:53,660
对汤姆来说  怎么表现都不为过
For Tom, there was never any such thing as too much.

212
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:57,480
汤姆的父亲  只是个普通蓝领工人
Tom's dad, he was a simple blue-collar worker,

早出晚归
came home late, got up really early the next day,

日复一日
and, you know, did it again.

215
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:04,610
他父母为了汤姆的幸福牺牲了很多
Both of his parents sacrificed a lot for Tom's happiness.

216

为了让汤姆进柯尔沃
His mom took a job as a janitor

217
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,410
他母亲找了份清洁工的工作
so that Tom could go to Culver.

{\an8}柯尔沃  美国一流高中

219

没有多少父母会这么做
Not many parents would do that --

220
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,910
为了让孩子接受最好的教育

222
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:18,070
汤姆的父亲曾在越南服役
Tom's dad was in Vietnam, and that's why

223
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:20,230
因此他高中时去了趟越南
he went to Vietnam when he was in high school.

224
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:23,560
他十分钦佩父亲为国奋战的行为
He definitely respected his dad for fighting for his country.

225
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,050
我觉得  随着汤姆不断长大
I think, as Tom got older,

226
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,900
随着他逐渐萌生自己的想法
as Tom became his own person,

227
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,670
他俩也变得愈发难以沟通
it just became difficult for them to connect.

228
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,060
汤姆总是固执地
Tom was always very adamant

229
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,450
说着自己的想法
about saying what he believed in,

230

而他父亲则无法接受

到了高中  我终于鼓起勇气
It was in high school that I finally got the courage

272
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:12,990
告诉马特我的感受  我给他写了封情书
to tell Matt how I felt, and I wrote him a love letter.

273

275

但他告诉我他不是同性恋
But he had to tell me that he's not gay.

276
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,640
我很伤心  但同时
And it broke my heart, but at the same time,

我也很高兴  因为他愿意继续做我朋友
I was still so happy that he was willing to be my friend.

"我也不想再跟你有什么联系"

I don't want to say what I really told her.

302
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,340
那不太礼貌  我大概是告诉她
It wasn't polite, and I just told her, basically,

因为马特的父母不允许他去
Matt's parents made it so he couldn't go,

他为那次旅行攒了许多钱

00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,730
是因为他觉得这是个
because he saw it as an opportunity

405
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:11,500
开阔眼界的机会
to open his horizons,

406
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,930
为此  他的父母功不可没
And, you know, his parents played a big role in that.

407
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:16,570
他妈妈在柯尔沃工作
His mom worked at culver,

408
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:19,750
因此他们才能支付减免的学费
primarily so that they could afford the reduced tuition,

409
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,790
因此汤姆才有了以后那些机会
so that Tom would have all those opportunities.

410
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,870
高三那年  他向我吐露心声
He came out to me our senior year.

411
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:28,350
那天晚上  我们坐在草地上
It was at night, and we were sitting in the grass,

412
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,640
我只记得  他突然变得很严肃
and I remember he got really serious all of a sudden,

413
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,960
他说  "我有事要告诉你"
And he said, "I have something to tell you --

414
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,360
"我是同性恋"
I'm gay."

415
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:36,080
之后他就把头埋了下去
Then he put his head in his lap,

416
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,090
哭了出来  他的情绪很激动
And he was crying and really emotional about it.

417
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:40,120
我想他真的很害怕被人说三道四
I think he was really afraid of being judged.

418
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:42,020
可我并没有感到惊讶
It didn't surprise me at all.

419
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,550
因为这位男性朋友

他上过军校

他总是能在社交

和学业之间游刃有余
in that entire social circle and academic circle.

439
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:30,220
后来他来到了自由的瓦萨学院
And then went to Vassar, which is this liberal place

00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,400
那里的氛围完全不同

448

他只是很单纯地接纳你这个人
He just accepted anybody and everybody for who they were,

449
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,230
可能是由于他的同志身份
and I think because he was gay,

450

他了解那些逆主流

455
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,790
"天哪  太不可思议了  你怎么做到的"
"Wow, you're amazing -- you've done so much"?

"我真是太崇拜你了"
"I'm in total awe of you --"

谁会这样说呢  没人这样说
Who says that? Nobody.

458
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:20,770
他会吟唱古典音乐
He gave recitals of classical music.

459
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:23,600
他写出的歌词感人肺腑
He wrote incredibly heartfelt lyrics.

460
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:27,030
但他同时也是个硬汉  可以把你打得落花流水
But he was tough, 'cause he could kick your ass.

461
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,120
能够把你摔倒在地
He could wrestle you down.

462
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:32,050
我知道他爸爸很严厉
I know that his dad was very stern.

463
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:36,130
在一定程度上  他认为

464
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:38,250
男子汉一定要有阳刚之气

465
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,680
这一点对他来说很重要

466
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:44,410
他希望汤姆也能够成为那样的男子汉
I think he wanted to have Tom basically play that role.

467
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:47,330
在这一点上  汤姆做得很好
And Tom knew how to play it very well.

468
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,470
我和汤姆之间
There was definitely

469
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,430
有一个从没说出口的共识
an unspoken understanding between Tom and I

470
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,510
那就是他的同志身份
that he was gay.

471
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,120
我知道他一直在为此挣扎
And I know that was a struggle for him,

472
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,030
因为他始终没有告诉自己的父母
because he still hadn't told his parents.

我想汤姆一定是担心

00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:52,120
不过没告诉他们这是我们刻意安排的
But we didn't tell them that it was a setup.

537
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,560
她跟我说有个叫汤姆的人也会去
She said that there was gonna be this guy there named Tom

538
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:58,150
他在这个行业中十分活跃
and that he's active in the industry,

539
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:59,590
{\an8}《新闻周刊》平面模特照

540
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:01,960
所以她觉得结识他  会对我今后的发展有帮助
So she thought that maybe it would be a good person to be connected with.

541
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,180
我们到了那里
We get there.

542
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,310
他非常引人注目
He is ridiculously attractive --

543
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,000
可以说帅气逼人  魅力非凡
gorgeous, if you will -- so charismatic.

544
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,310
他当过演员
He was an actor.

545
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,290
拍过几部戏
I think he had been in a few things.

546
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:15,530
就在此时
And almost immediately,

547
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:17,530
谢恩开始怀疑我们的目的
Shane became skeptical.

548
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,940
{\an1}我们喜欢这些男人

549
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,940
{\an1}性感的邻家男孩

550
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:19,400
他开始问"这家伙是谁"
He was like, "who is this guy?"

551
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,540
我反问他"他为何让你如此纠结  谢恩"
And I'm like, "why is he bothering you so much, Shane?"

552
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,540
他比我大四岁
He was four years older than me.

553
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,510
去过很多地方
Like, he had traveled the world,

554
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:28,100
会说外语
you know, spoke a different language.

555
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,470
会演奏好几种乐器
He played a bunch of instruments.

556
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,410
他总是自信满满的样子
He was just so cocky and confident,

557
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:34,980
当然  保龄球也打得很好
and, well, of course, he, like, was bowling really well.

558
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:39,080
而我  连五个瓶都击不倒
And then here I am, like, can't even knock five pins down.

559
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,410
在打完保龄球不久之后
So, it wasn't too long after we went bowling

560
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:44,580
我们又在我朋友莉兹的公寓里碰到了
that we all got together again at my friend Lizzy's apartment.

561
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,310
就在那天晚上
It was that night

562
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:47,400
我们终于互换了手机号码
that we finally exchanged phone numbers.

563
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:49,230
我们一起出去玩
We ended up hanging out,

564
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:51,010
四处周游
you know, a few times here and there.

565
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:53,890
他一直唱歌  总是很开心的样子
And he was always singing. He was always happy.

566
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,120
{\an9}♪生活就像高速公路
♪ Life is a highway

567
00:22:56,510 --> 00:23:00,320
{\an9}♪我要星夜兼程
♪ I want to ride it all night long

568
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,940
我和汤姆  我们白天一直待在一起
Tom and I, we would spend all day together,

569
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,920
之后他回自己家
and then he would go home,

570
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,970
然后  晚上的时候
which would lead to, later in the evening,

571
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,810
我们还要讲上几个小时的电话
talking on the phone for a few hours.

572
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,320
没过多久
It did not take long

573
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,970
我就觉得与汤姆相处很愉快
for me to really feel comfortable with Tom,

574
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:15,160
可以对他无所不谈
that I could tell him anything.

575
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:18,820
可以信任他一辈子
Like, I trusted him with my life.

576
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:21,340
汤姆是个很自信的人
Tom was a very confident person.

577
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,150
是他主动追求谢恩
He went after Shane.

578
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:25,000
起初  谢恩的反应是"天呐"
At first, Shane was like, "aah,"

579
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:27,530
因为他从没谈过恋爱
'cause he had never been in a relationship before.

580
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:30,730
这对他来说是初恋
This was his, you know, first love.

581
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:33,020
我们有次去听汤姆演唱
We went to hear Tom one time,

582
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:36,070
谢恩会在他表演的时候环顾四周
and Shane would look around the room while he was playing

583
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:41,310
因为他想让所有人都专心听他唱歌
because he wanted to make sure everybody was paying attention

584
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:43,570
并对他同样狂热
and seeing what he saw.

585
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:46,890
有一个犹太单词叫做自豪
And there is a Jewish word called kvell.

586
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:50,670
那正是汤姆表演时他脸上的神情
And that's what he looked like when Tom performed --

587
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:51,590
他无比自豪
he was kvelling.

588
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,240
热情洋溢
He was glowing.

589
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:58,440
终于体验到爱情的滋味非常美妙
It was incredible to finally experience that feeling of love,

590
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,400
有如心花怒放一般
you know, like the butterflies.

591
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,290
这正是我想象中我的朋友们有过的感受
It's what I always imagined that all my friends felt.

592
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:06,150
没过多久  我就搬进了他的公寓
It didn't take long for me to move into his apartment.

593
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,510
他们很快就走到了一起
They got very close very quickly.

594
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:10,700
我认为他们能走到一起并不是因为搬去了洛杉矶
I think their freedom wasn't moving to L.A.

595
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,790
而是由于汤姆为谢恩创造了
I think Tom was definitely the door for Shane

596
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:16,480
认同自己的机会
to come to terms with himself.

597
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:18,840
汤姆是他的避风港
Tom was a safe place.

598
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:22,030
汤姆认识谢恩的时候  他就像只迷失的羊
When Tom met Shane, he was a little, lost sheep.

599
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:25,430
汤姆真的把谢恩照顾的很好
And Tom really looked out for Shane.

600
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,870
他喜欢给我做饭  哪怕他累了一天
He loved making dinner even when he was really tired.

601
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:30,280
他喜欢替我系领带
He loved tying my ties --

602
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,000
甚至用专门的方法帮我叠衬衫
even properly tucking my shirt in,

603
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,460
因为柯尔沃教过他该怎么弄
because at Culver, they teach you how to do all that.

604
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,100
汤姆一心追求他的梦想
Tom truly was pursuing his dreams,

605
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:40,400
而谢恩明白账单需要有人支付
and Shane knew that bills had to be paid.

606
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,610
谢恩是个很理性地人
Shane was the level-headed one.

607
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,750
一人没考虑周全的地方  另一人可以互补
What one couldn't think of, the other one could.

608
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,470
他们发现彼此之间有很多共同点
They found an awful lot in common.

609
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:50,870
他们都是浪漫主义者
They were both romantics.

610
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,160
他们都来自小镇
They're both from small towns.

611
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:59,040
都希望让世人对他们刮目相看
Both wanted to make an impression on the world.

612

他们总是面带微笑  生活得很开心
They were always smiling and always having a good time.

614
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,530
他们是那种让你相信爱情的情侣
I mean, they're the kind of couple that makes you believe in love.

我喜欢看他们斗嘴
I just loved their bickering,

617
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,640
那简直是打情骂俏
which was really flirting.

618
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:12,330
在他们感情中  我最喜欢那个部分
That was probably my favorite part of their relationship.

619
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:12,820
{\pos(190,239)}别太用力

620
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,760
我在军校为别人剃过一次头发
I did this once in military school --

621
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,140
最后那孩子不得不剃成光头
the kid had to shave his head.

622
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,670
你为什么告诉我这事
Why are you telling me that?

623
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:21,390
说真的  别太用力
Seriously, don't press so hard.

624
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:24,450
他们就像一对老夫老妻
They were like an old married couple --

625
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:27,590
他们很年轻  又是同性恋  却不爱外出消遣
they were young, gay, but they never wanted to go out.

626
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,210
我有时提议"我们去酒吧吧  我们去夜店吧"
I'm like, "let's go to the bar. Let's go to the club."

628
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,130
他们不太外出消遣
They didn't go out a lot,

629
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,110
因为他们总是在努力工作
'cause they were always working,

630
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:33,130
想方设法地构建自己的生活
trying to build something.

631
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:37,240
我知道对汤姆而言  这不仅是为了忠贞
I know that, for Tom, it wasn't just about fidelity,

632
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,560
当然  这很重要
which, of course, was like number one.

633
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,680
与此同时
It was also about being

634
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,720
他将自己的情感
completely emotionally available,

635
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:47,120
精神和灵魂都完全交给了谢恩
mentally available, spiritually available to Shane.

636
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,170
当你到了我这把岁数
When you get to my age,

637
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:51,580
会对一切抱有怀疑态度
you start being a little agnostic

638
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,470
比如感情那种事谁都说不准
that anything like that can occur.

639
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:56,670
但渐渐的  我能明显的看出
But over time, it became pretty apparent

他们之间的感情

Shane and Tom started doing online promotion for musicians.

650
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:26,500
他们有个小小的工作室

真是有趣极了

00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:10,520
我觉得他们真的很喜欢这个想法
I think they just really liked the idea

671
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:14,910
拍下他们所经历的美好时光  并与世人分享
of taking the excitement that they had and sharing it.

672
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,410
我和汤姆越是相爱
The more Tom and I fell in love,

673
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:19,490
我们越想告诉我们的父母
the more we wanted to tell our parents about it.

674
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,450
但是我们有个想法
But each of us had the philosophy

675
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,740
在没有找到那个
that there was no need to tell your family

676
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:27,330
{\an1}{\pos(40.167,238)}谢恩的姐妹

677
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:25,380
能够与你共度余生的伴侣之前
until you found that person

678
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,340
没必要告诉自己的家人
that you were gonna spend the rest of your life with.

679
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,230
我妈和阿姨来看我
So, my mom and my aunt were visiting,

680
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:30,940
那天已经很晚了
and it was very late at night,

681
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:33,810
但我跟我妈说我得和她谈谈
but I told my mom that I had to talk to her.

682
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:38,070
当着汤姆的面  我说"妈"
With Tom by my side, I said, "mom."

683
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:41,130
我说"亲爱的  如果你想告诉我你是同性恋"
I said, "honey, if you're gonna tell me you're gay,

684
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:45,340
"没关系  我知道这事  我可以接受"
that's fine. I know it, and I'm okay with it."

685
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,280
接着我问"汤姆是你的伴侣吗"
And I said, "and is Tom your partner?"

686
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,790
汤姆说"是的  我是他的伴侣"
And Tom goes, "yep. I'm his partner."

687
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:52,270
汤姆坐在那  本以为会有一场激烈的争吵
Tom was sitting there waiting for a big blowup or something,

688
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,070
而我只说了句  "太好了"
And I just said, "Well, great.

689
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:57,410
"我不用再像以前那样担心谢恩了"
You know, I don't have to worry about Shane like I did."

690
00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:01,150
汤姆是上天赐予我的礼物
Tom was my godsend.

691
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:03,280
谢恩的焦虑症再也没发过
Shane didn't have his anxieties anymore.

692
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,510
他更有自信
He was more confident.

693
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:06,370
生活得很幸福
He was happy.

694
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,560
变得更像一个男子汉了
He was just more of a man.

695
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,300
我从没想过
I never imagined

696
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:13,210
我会比以前更爱我母亲
that I could love my mom even more than I did.

697
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:15,850
当我为自己是同性恋而挣扎时  她一直陪在我身边
She had been there through all my struggles of being gay.

698
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:18,930
我们从没有开诚布公地谈过这件事
And we never said out loud what the real deal was,

699
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:20,450
但现在终于说出来了
but now we had.

700
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:23,010
那感觉真的好极了
It was the greatest feeling ever.

701
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:29,560
{\an1}{\pos(41.367,238.8)}演唱: 汤姆

702
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:31,930
我和汤姆知道
Tom and I knew

703
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:34,130
向他父母坦白会是个巨大的挑战
it would be a challenge to come out to his parents.

704
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,700
他去印第安纳州过圣诞节
So, he was in Indiana for Christmas.

705
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,640
当时只有他和他母亲两个人
It was just him and his mom.

706
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:42,860
电视上播放了一档
And there was something that came on TV

707
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,310
关于女同情侣的节目
about a lesbian couple,

708
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:47,850
汤姆的母亲说那太恶心了
And Tom's mom made a comment about how that was disgusting.

709
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:51,480
就在那时  汤姆意识到
And Tom, at that moment, just realized,

710
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,860
"我得告诉她真相"
"Like, I need to tell her."

711
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,150
他对他母亲说  "妈  我是同性恋"
He told his mom, "Mom, I'm gay.

712
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:57,760
"你说那样的话  其实也在说我"
When you say things like that, you're talking about me."

713
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,900
我觉得他以为事情会像
He was, I think, sort of building

714
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,550
谢恩出柜时一样
on what had happened when Shane came out.

715
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:04,660
谢恩向他母亲坦白的时候
Shane had come out to his mother,

716
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,140
她母亲已经猜得八九不离十
and she basically filled in the blanks --

717
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,910
"你是同性恋  我早知道了"
"Oh, you're gay. I knew that already.

718
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,020
"我一直都知道"
I always knew that."

719
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:12,470
我一直以为他母亲知道他是同性恋
I was sure that his mom knew that he was gay.

720
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:16,530
但她立马给他父亲打了电话
But she immediately called his dad

721
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:18,210
让他下班回家
to come home from work

722
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,280
就因为这条令人震惊的消息
because of this breaking news.

723
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,300
她一直不停地说
And she went on and on

724
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:26,400
这是罪过
about how it was a sin

725
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,110
说汤姆应该早点告诉他们
and that Tom should have told them sooner

726
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:29,710
这样就可以带他接受治疗
so he could have gotten medical help.

727
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:32,460
他父亲对他说了一些很难听的话
His dad said a lot of hateful things towards him

728
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,820
他怪谢恩把他儿子变成了同性恋
and blamed Shane for making him gay.

729
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:37,870
"都是谢恩的错  他让你变成了同性恋"
"It's Shane's fault. Shane turned you gay.

730
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:40,360
"在洛杉矶生活让你变成了同性恋"
Being in L.A. Turned you gay."

731
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,900
"你所有的成就都变得一文不值"
"All of your accomplishments so far mean nothing now."

732
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:46,160
他们说  "你得改变想法  你必须改变想法"
They said, "Change your mind. You have to change your mind."

733
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,950
汤姆一直说不
And Tom said that he just kept saying no --

734
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:49,620
他说  "我改变不了"
Like, you know, "I can't change my mind.

735
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,420
"这是没法改变的事"
It's not a mind-change thing."

736
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:52,720
汤姆打电话给我
Tom called me.

737
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,000
说他父亲拿枪指着他
He told me that his dad pulled a shotgun on him.

738
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:00,400
当时我非常害怕
And at that point, I was really scared.

739
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,080
我俩通电话的时候
So, while Tom and I were on the phone,

740
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,130
他父亲诺曼把门从门框上扯了下来
His dad, Norman, literally ripped the door off the hinges.

741
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:09,990
他母亲拿起电话对我说
And his mom got on the phone, and she said to me,

742
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,280
"听着  你个狗娘养的"
"Listen here, fucker --

743
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:15,320
"我不知道你对我儿子做了什么"
I don't know what you did to our son,

744
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:18,680
"但我们会去洛杉矶  把你揪出来"
but we're gonna come to L.A., and we're gonna find you."

745
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,160
我记得他父亲说的原话是
I think the phrase his dad used was,

746
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,240
他要去加州把他的肠子扯出来
He was gonna come out to California and gut him.

747
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:26,810
我以前总有这样的幻想
I used to always have this fantasy

748
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:31,810
我和汤姆去印第安纳过圣诞节
of Tom and I going to Indiana for Christmas

749
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:34,480
一同进入梦乡

然后在圣诞节早晨醒来
and waking up on Christmas morning,

752
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,170
大家聚在客厅里
all of us going out to the living room --

客厅里有棵圣诞树
You know, there's the tree,

00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:43,300
我和汤姆跟他家人坐在一起
and Tom and I just sitting there with his family,

755
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,830
一起拆开礼物
opening presents together,

756
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:48,550
我会说一些我觉得有趣的事情
and me just saying something that I think's funny,

放眼望去  汤姆的父母在开怀大笑
and I look over, and Tom's parents are laughing.

758
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:55,120
我知道这想法很蠢  但是...
It's stupid, but it's just...

759
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:58,520
如果真能梦想成真
It would be like an incredible thing

760
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,850
那该多好啊
if something like that happened.

When the police showed up at the house,

00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,330
汤姆的父亲不屑一顾地说
Tom's dad just kind of pooh-poohed it off, and he said,

763
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,260
"你知道那些加州小孩是什么德性"
"Ah, you know how these California kids are."

这两个孩子都让我心疼极了

真是太可怕  太让人难过了
It was just so scary and so sad.

768
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:17,450
第二天一早
So, that next morning,

769
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:19,740
汤姆的父母在厨房里
Tom's parents were in the kitchen

770
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,670
桌子上放着一本圣经
with a bible on the table.

771
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:23,850
他们大声诵读里面的篇章
Out loud, they were saying the verses,

772
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:26,730
{\an8}圣经说教开始了
他们正在找对应的篇章

773
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:27,120
像是在为昨天发生的事找理由
almost, in a way, just to justify that, the day before,

774
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:30,200
{\an8}我为他们祈祷
汤姆  真心的

775
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,300
他们打了他们的儿子  只因为他是同性恋
they beat up their son because he was gay.

776
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,450
他说  "我真不敢相信"
He's like, "I can't believe this.

777
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,580
{\an8}糟透了...
我不小心咬了我妈

778
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:33,560
"我竟然被打了  他们还说"
"I just got attacked and told

779
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,740
"我应该把我是同性恋这件事"
"that I should have taken the fact that I'm gay

780
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,670
"带进坟墓里"
to the grave."

781
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:43,210
{\an8}我父亲从未如此害怕我
我看见他眼里的恐惧  我差点杀了他

782
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:44,360
情况很糟糕
It was just an awful situation,

783
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,950
于是汤姆尽快离开了
and Tom, you know, got out of there as soon as he could

784
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,250
飞回了加利福尼亚
and flew back to California.

785
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:58,500
最后玛莎还是来了加州
So, eventually, Martha made her way out to California,

786
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:01,140
我非常非常紧张
and I was really, really nervous.

787
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,160
这是自那次糟糕的经历后
This was like the first time that I was going to see Martha

788
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,670
我第一次见到玛莎
since that, you know, horrible experience.

789
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:08,880
我觉得玛莎之所以来这
I think Martha came here

790
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,410
是因为她不想失去她的儿子
because she did not want to lose her son.

791
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,940
所以她必须接受谢恩
So she had to embrace Shane

792
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:17,260
表现出她似乎接受了这段感情
and act like she accepted the relationship.

793
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,170
开始有点尴尬
It was a little awkward for awhile.

794
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,180
但渐渐地  我们熟起来了
But, eventually, you know, we warmed up to each other.

795
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,700
我们一起去吃晚餐
We would go to dinner.

796
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:27,200
汤姆跟她一起歇斯底里地笑
Tom and her would laugh, like, hysterically.

797
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,150
他俩在一起时
When they get together,

798
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:30,130
就像两个小老太太
it's like two little, old ladies.

799
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:32,270
尽管她没有明说
And although she didn't say, like, you know,

800
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,950
"谢恩  对不起"  或是  "汤姆  对不起"
"Shane, I'm sorry," or, "Tom, I'm sorry

801
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:35,860
"我们之前不该那么对你"
for how we handled everything,"

802
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:38,740
对我们来说  她是在用自己的方式
To us, it was like this is her way

803
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,450
表示她接受我们了
of showing that she's accepting us.

804
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,810
她不仅爱她儿子  她真的爱死他儿子了
It wasn't that she loved her son -- she loved her son.

805
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:49,080
她会不惜一切代价接近他
And whatever it took to be near him, she did.

806
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,670
哪怕去耕地她都愿意
If she had to push a plow, she would,

807
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,210
只要能接近她的儿子
just to be near her son.

808
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:57,470
这张照片是他们去格劳曼剧院的时候拍的
She has this picture where they went to Grauman theatre

809
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,700
当时还看了埃尔维斯的手印
and saw Elvis' handprints.

810
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,830
她说那是她一生中最快乐的日子
She said that was the happiest day of her life.

811
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:05,750
我觉得她很享受在加州的生活
I think she truly enjoyed coming out to California.

812
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:07,750
然后她回到印第安纳之后
And then she would get back to Indiana,

813
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:12,070
又基本上全盘否定汤姆在这的生活
and, basically, wouldn't acknowledge Tom's life here.

814
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:14,640
进展就像婴儿学步一样缓慢
And, you know, again, it was kind of like just baby steps.

815
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:16,520
几次之后
Truly, after like a few times,

816
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,300
我们觉得她接受了我们
we felt like she was okay with us

817
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,720
她为我们高兴
and she was happy for us.

818
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,070
她还坚持让我和汤姆睡卧室
She even insisted on Tom and me taking the bedroom

819
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:26,200
她和我们的狗一起睡沙发
while she stayed on the sofa with our dog.

822

看着我
Look at me.

823
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,550
你怎么忍心
How could you...

824
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:37,370
留我独守空闺
leave me all alone?

825
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,640
好吧  我想你  可你只想和她待在一起
Okay, I miss you, and you just want to stay with her.

826
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,410
你这个叛徒
You're such a traitor.

827
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:47,240
没错  低头忏悔去吧
Yeah. You put that head down.

828
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:52,900
汤姆很喜欢他的狗
Tom was obsessed with his dog.

829
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:56,640
总是给它拍照片
Tom was always, always taking pictures of him.

830
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,720
就像是他的亲生宝宝
It was like someone with, like, a newborn baby.

831
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:02,280
它被遗弃在好莱坞的一辆车底下
He was actually found abandoned under a car in Hollywood.

832
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:05,840
你好啊  拿破仑  最近过得好吗
Hi, Napoleon. How are you?

833
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:08,020
它有一套圣诞老人的衣服
He had a Santa Claus outfit,

834
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,800
还有些其他稀奇古怪的服饰
and he had some other crazy outfit.

835
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,330
我就想  "天呐"
And I thought, "Oh, my god.

836
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:12,680
"这不会是两个同性恋人"
"This is not gonna be two gay boys

837
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,920
"和他们的基情小狗吧"
with their gay, little dog, is it?"

838
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,940
果不其然  很快Facebook上
And sure enough -- pretty quick, on Facebook,

839
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:17,630
汤姆就上传了

00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,240
"别闹了"
You got to quit that."

00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,670

00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:55,890
认为我不会接纳他
that wouldn't accept him,

902
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:58,920
你能够看得出他为此花的心思

我见过他逗谢恩大笑
I saw that he made Shane laugh.

910

遇到灵魂伴侣后才会有的

So, Tom and I went to Arizona to visit my grandparents.

我的曾祖母帕特也在
And my Great-grandma Pat was there.

918

And no one told Grandma Pat that Tom and I were a couple.

我不知道谢恩是同性恋
Well, I never knew Shane was gay,

但当我见到他伴侣时

汤姆迷上帕特祖母是有原因的
Tom was fascinated with Grandma Pat for a few reasons.

You know, every year, she keeps track of how many snakes she kills.

934
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:11,840
帕特祖母搂着汤姆
Grandma Pat like put her arm around Tom.

935
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:14,020
她说  "欢迎加入这个大家庭"
She was like, "Welcome to the family."

936
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,600
她已经九十岁了
She's 90 years old,

937
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,960
但仍然能接纳了我们的关系
and, you know, she's accepting our relationship.

938
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,570
对他们品头论足的那些人
People that talk about them,

939
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:22,690
他们对此一知半解
they don't understand a lot of it.

940
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:25,920
他们认为  如果他俩去教堂
And they think that, if they go to church and everything,

941
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,520
上帝自会惩罚他们
that God will take care of it --

942
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,070
就像惩罚其他同性恋一样
They can be just like all the rest of the guys.

943
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:32,870
所以你没法说服他们
And so you can't get through to them.

944
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:35,840
说实话  那些话我都听腻了
To tell you the truth, I'm tired of hearing about it --

945
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,090
他们的确不是罗密欧与茱丽叶
So they're not Romeo and Juliet.

946
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:40,440
没错  他们是罗密欧与罗密欧
That's right -- they're Romeo and Romeo.

947
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,520
多大事啊
Get over it.

948
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:47,290
我不喜欢在公共场合表露自己的情感
I did not like to show any public display of affection --

949
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,800
即便是坐在飞机上
Whether it would be us on a plane flying somewhere,

950
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:53,010
我们想亲热时
and we wanted to be affectionate,

951
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:56,780
会用大衣或是毯子遮住手臂
we would actually take a coat or a blanket and cover our arms,

952
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:59,420
然后在毯子下紧握双手
and like hold hands under the blanket.

953
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:02,020
{\pos(190,237)}不要太明显啦

954
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:07,160
我认为谢恩很在意他们所处的场合
I think that Shane was very conscious of where they were

955
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,390
不想让别人感到不舒服
and not making other people uncomfortable.

956
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,300
我从不会当着朋友或其他人的面
I never really wanted to say, "I love you"

957
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,250
说"我爱你"
in front of friends or anyone.

958
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,490
所以我俩就发明了个小暗号
So we developed this little code --

959
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:19,540
无论在晚宴或是派对上
Whether we're at like a dinner or a party,

960
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:22,730
其中一人会设法敲三下桌子
one of us would find a way just to tap the table three times

961
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:24,560
以此代替"我爱你"
just to say, "I love you."

962
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:28,930
因此  这个声音对我俩来说很特殊
So, that became a very special sound for both of us.

963
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:32,190
汤姆热情洋溢
Tom was just so passionate,

964
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,930
他的满腔爱意
and he was so affectionate

965
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:37,740
在一定程度上慢慢瓦解了谢恩的心理障碍
that it sort of brought Shane out of his shell a little bit,

966
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:39,730
{\an1}{\pos(40.167,214)}柯琳 朋友

967
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,650
使他在大庭广众之下
as far as, you know, being out in public

968
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:43,600
不会因此而感到羞愧或难堪
and not being ashamed or embarrassed that,

969
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:46,630
敢于大声喊出  "没错  这是我的伴侣  我们是同性恋"

970
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:47,850

972
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,490
有一次  我们在巴黎
Once, we were in Paris,

973
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,200
我们站在埃菲尔铁塔前
and we were in front of the Eiffel Tower,

974
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:53,220
我突然想  "去他妈的"
I just decided like, "Screw it --

975
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,430
"我就要偷偷亲他一下"  我真这么做了
I'm just gonna sneak in a kiss," and I did.

976
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:59,800
汤姆的表情像是在说  "刚才发生了什么"
Tom's face -- he was just like, "What just happened?"

977
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:00,620
他非常激动
He was so excited.

978
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,590
但亲完之后我俩的第一个反应是
But then the first thing we did after the kiss,

979
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:05,530
"有被人看到吗"  四处张望
we like looked around, like, "Did anyone see us?"

980
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,210
但我很高兴这么做
But I'm so happy that I did that

981
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:10,670
因为他欣喜若狂
'cause he was just thrilled.

982
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:13,740
汤姆想和谢恩结婚
Tom wanted to marry Shane,

983
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,720
但他想要真正合法的婚姻
but he wanted it to be legal.

984
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,410
而不是所谓"原则上合法"的说辞
He wasn't gonna settle for a technicality,

985
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:21,520
或是"现在还算合法  但明天就说不准了"
or an, "Oh, it happens to be legal right this minute,

986
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,150
这种自欺欺人的态度
but tomorrow it could not be."

987
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:26,010
他是那种有担当的男人
He was the kind of man that just stood up for things,

988
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:27,450
我觉得在他的内心深处
and I think part of it

989
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:29,780
他是想向家里所有人表态
was like he wanted to show everyone back home that,

990
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,800
"我是认真的  这就是我"
"I'm serious. This is me."

圣诞快乐
爱你直到海枯石烂
爱你的汤姆

992
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,340
他买了个戒指作为我的圣诞礼物
He bought me a ring for Christmas,

993
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:38,310
我们曾约定不在对方身上花钱
and we had agreed to not spend any money on each other.

994
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,910
他对我说  "谢恩肯定会生我气的"
He would tell me, "But Shane's gonna get mad,

995
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:41,080
"我们是有预算的"
"because we have a budget,

996
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,380
"但我真的很想送个给他"
"but I just want to get it for him so bad."

997
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:44,090
我打开包装  是个戒指
And I opened it, and it was a ring

998
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:46,640
还有一张纸条  上面写着
with a note in it that said,

00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,920
"2011年将会永远改变我们的生活"
"2011 will change our lives forever.

00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:52,400
谢谢你给我的爱
若不是你我早已迷失自己
我有预感  2011年将会永远改变我们的生活

00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:51,400
"爱你的汤姆"
Love, Tom."

1002
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:54,510
我曾幻想过他们结婚时的场景
I had the image of their wedding played out in my head.

1003
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:56,230
我知道这一天迟早会到来
I knew it was gonna happen someday.

1004
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:56,900
毋庸置疑的是
There was no question

1005
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,610
他们想要和对方共度余生
that they wanted to spend the rest of their lives together

1006
00:40:58,610 --> 00:40:59,980
并组建家庭
and have a family.

1007
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,490
这正是他所渴求的
That was something he wanted so bad.

1008
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:03,120
他过去常说
He used to say,

1009
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,860
"我好想要个小汤姆跑来跑去"
"You know, I'd love to have a little Thomas running around."

1010
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,830
我在思考谢恩和汤姆的故事时
And I guess one of the saddest parts,

1011
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:10,800
我觉得最令人伤心的部分是
when I really think about Shane and Tom, is the fact that,

1012
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,820
他们基本上实现了"美国梦"
essentially, they were living the American dream,

1013
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:14,950
除了他们没法结婚这条
with the exception of being able to get married to each other.

1014
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:16,970
当然很多人会提到"同居伴侣"这个概念
Well, everyone, like, brings up domestic partnership,

1015
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:19,410
这在某种程度上挺令我气愤的
and it angers me in a way,

1016
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:21,740
因为任何小姑娘都不会坐在自己的房间里
because no little girl is sitting in her room

1017
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:22,570
幻想着说
and saying that,

1018
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:24,690
"我等不及想要个同居伴侣"
"I can't wait to have a domestic partnership.

1019
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:27,960
"我等不及在同居期间穿上婚纱"
"I can't wait to wear a white dress during my domestic partnership."

1020
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,980
这不是大家梦想中的事情
That's not something that people dream about.

1021
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:33,120
大家梦想的是结婚
They dream about getting married.

1022
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,070
而他们却没法结婚
And they weren't allowed to do that.

1023
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,260
即使现在同性婚姻合法了
And if it is ever legal,

1024
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,540
他俩也无法步入婚姻殿堂
they'll never be able to experience it,

1025
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,010
因为他已经不在了
because he's not here anymore.

1026
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:47,180
我很庆幸在汤姆去世前的那周三见过他一面

And he was the one that was like, "Let's do it. Let's do it."

1063
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,230
"我可以给你做发型吗"
"Hey, can I do your hair?"

1064
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:19,290
我说  "好吧"
I was like, "Um, okay."

1065
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:23,080
然后我往胸罩里塞满了袜子
And I have, you know, my brassiere filled with socks,

1066
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,250
因为...  我并没那么丰满
'cause, you know, there's just not much there.

1067
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:27,920
{\an8}汤姆  我爱你胜过一切  真的

1068
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:28,040
汤姆一整天都在跟我发信息
So, Tom and I were texting throughout the day.

1069
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:30,070
{\an8}我爱你  谢恩

1070
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:30,330
我们最终和好了
And we eventually made up.

1071
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:32,980
我们根本没讨论去不去屋顶
It wasn't even a discussion whether or not to go to the roof,

1072
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:34,590
因为我们经常到屋顶上去
because we always went to the roof.

1073
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:36,910
我们在短信里说深爱着对方
And we told each other that we love each other.

1074
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,670
我很欣慰我们和好了
And I'm so thankful that we did,

1075
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:42,140
因为这已成了我永恒的回忆
'cause I have that forever now.

1076
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:45,300
我们去屋顶的时候
And so, by the time we get up to the roof,

1077
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:47,620
汤姆拿着他的照相机
Tom has his camera.

1078
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:48,360
他准备就绪了
He's all ready.

1079
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,610
我们差不多上去过50多次
We'd all been up there like 50 times,

1080
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:52,330
但每次我都很害怕
and every time, I'm just paranoid.

1081
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:54,360
因为护栏其实不高
'cause it's not like a tall wall.

1082
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,740
是很矮的那种
It's a short wall.

1083
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:58,950
他就拿着相机各种拍
He was just playing around with the camera,

1084
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:01,650
我知道他同时也在给谢恩发信息
and, meanwhile, I know that he had just been texting to Shane.

1085
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:02,620
{\an8}不要靠近边缘

1086
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:04,160
我告诉他别跑到边上去
I told him to stay away from the edge,

1087
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:07,080
{\an8}我可不是开玩笑  汤姆

1088
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,830
因为我们都知道他是个笨手笨脚的人
'cause we all know that he's a klutz.

1089
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,500
他回复我说
And he even wrote back.

1090
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:11,160
"哈哈  我不会的"  好像我在跟他开玩笑
He was like, "Ha-ha! I will" Like, I was joking.

1091
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,820
我说  "汤姆  我是认真的"
And I said, "Tom, I'm serious.

1092
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:15,350
"别跑到边上去"
Like, stay away from the edge."

1093
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:18,660
他照了几张照片
So, he takes a bunch of pictures.

1094
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:21,250
我尽量表现得风骚
I'm trying to be as slutty --

1095
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:24,400
不是性感  因为确实不性感
You know, not sexy, 'cause it wasn't sexy.

1096
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:28,020
我在屋顶的一个角落  然后我们换了位置
I'm in one corner, and then we suddenly switch.

1097
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:31,410
他说  "我拍到了  我拍到了"
And he's like, " I've got it! I've got it!"

1098
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:34,670
然后他往后退了三四步
So, he takes like three or four steps back.

1099
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:42,200
{\an1}{\pos(40.167,240)}汤姆为艾丽克斯拍的最后一张照片

1100
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:46,520
谁都想不到他会掉下去
I don't think it registered that he was gonna fall.

1101
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,610
他当时看起来像这样  而我则是这样
He was like, "Ha-ha!" And I was like, "Ohh."

1102
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:50,140
然后我看着他
You know, and I looked at him,

1103
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:51,900
当时的感觉就是  "天呐"
And it was like we both thought, "Oh, no.

1104
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,150
"谢恩会气死的"
Shane's gonna be so mad."

1105
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:56,610
好像他知道了我们离边缘这么近一样
You know, just like if he knew that we were that close.

1106
00:44:56,610 --> 00:45:00,200
之后  便是一场噩梦的开始
And then, after that, it was a nightmare.

1107
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:03,580
我甚至没去边上往下看
I didn't even go look over the edge.

1108
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:06,440
我把鞋子一扔  跑下楼去
I just, like, threw my shoes on, ran downstairs.

1109
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,110
我的手机在后兜里
I had my phone in my back pocket,

1110
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:10,770
我拨了911  但什么都听不到
And I dialed 911, but I couldn't hear.

1111
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:13,300
所以我就把手机给了走廊里的人
So I just gave it to somebody out in the hallway,

1112
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:14,310
因为大家听到他坠楼的动静
'cause people heard him.

1113
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:18,960
我收到艾丽克斯的短信说汤姆掉下去了
I received a text from Alex to tell me that Tom had fallen.

1114
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:21,070
汤姆掉下去了

1115
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:23,170
我以为这是个玩笑  "这不可能是真的"
And I thought it was a joke -- "There's no way this is real."

1116
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:26,950
所以我回复她说  "这一点也不好笑"
So I texted her back, and I said, "That's not funny."

1117
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:28,620
汤姆掉下去了

1118
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:28,620
说真的  别乱开玩笑

1119
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:30,660
汤姆掉下去了

1120
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:30,660
说真的  别乱开玩笑

1121
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:29,710
之后我没再收到她的回复
And then I didn't hear back from her.

1122
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:32,450
于是我打了汤姆的手机
And so then I called Tom's phone,

1123
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:34,530
但没人接
and no one picked up.

1124
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:38,090
就在那时  我开始着急了
So at that moment is when my heart just started racing.

1125
00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:41,450
我跑到楼下的时候  他趴在地上
By the time I got there, he's on, you know, his stomach.

1126
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:44,040
我抚摸着他的背
And I'm rubbing his back.

1127
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:46,320
我说  "没事的  汤米  没事的"
And I'm saying, "It's okay, Tommy. It's okay, Tommy."

1128
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,840
而我穿的像个妓女
Meanwhile, I look like a total hooker.

1129
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:52,920
救护车过了好久才到
But it takes forever for the ambulance to get there.

1130
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,650
差不多过了有25分钟吧
I want to say 25 minutes later.

1131
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:57,350
他们问我  "你有他的身份证件吗"
They were like, "Do you have his I.D.?

1132
00:45:57,350 --> 00:45:58,320
"你有他的身份证件吗"
Do you have his I.D.?"

1133
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,440
我说  "身份证有那么重要吗"
And I was like, "What the fuck does it matter?!

1134
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:01,690
"赶紧把他抬上救护车呀"
Just get him on the ambulance!"

1135
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:02,750
我赶到急诊室
So, I got to the E.R.,

1136
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:05,290
他们把我带到艾丽克斯的房间
and they took me into a room where Alex was,

1137
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:07,100
她情绪很激动
and she was hysterical.

1138
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:08,790
我一看到谢恩
And when I first saw Shane,

1139
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:13,050
我说  "要是坠楼的是我就好了"
I said, "I wish it were me."

1140
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:20,950
我说  "因为你们拥有彼此"
I said, "Because you two have each other,

1141
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:24,020
"你俩爱得那么死去活来"
"and the love you have is so strong,

1142
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:27,130
"我真希望掉下去的是我"
I wish it had been me who fell over."

1143
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,470
我问她  "现在是什么状况"
I asked her, you know, "Well, what's happening?

1144
00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:34,110
"他们还在抢救吗"  我完全不知情
are they working on him?" I didn't know anything.

1145
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:35,380
她也一无所知
And she didn't know anything.

1146
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:39,570
我们抱在一起  说爱着对方
We hugged, you know, and we said we loved each other.

1147
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:44,560
我仍抱有希望  觉得他会没事的
And I was still hanging on to hope that he was okay.

1148
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:45,380
我试着给谢恩打电话
I tried calling Shane,

1149
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:47,010
但总联系不上他
and I couldn't get through to him.

1150
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:49,650
后来  他终于给我回了电话
And, finally, he calls me back.

1151
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:51,820
他说  "妈  汤姆去拍照"
He said, "Mom, Tom was doing a photo shoot,

1152
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:52,800
"从屋顶上坠楼了"
and he fell off the roof."

1153
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,380
我说  "天呐"
And I just -- "Oh, my god."

1154
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:55,620
我说  "亲爱的  要一直祈祷"
I said, "Honey, just keep on praying.

1155
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:58,220
"他会没事的  咱们都会为他祈祷的" 
He'll be fine. You know, we'll get the prayers going here."

1156
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:01,990
我收到谢恩的短信说
I got a text message from Shane saying,

1157
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:04,760
"米凯拉  求你快祈祷  汤姆受伤了"
"Michaela, please pray -- Tom's hurt."

1158
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:09,260
我立刻跪在地上  开始祈祷
And I immediately got down and started praying.

1159
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:10,660
过了一会儿  他打给我
So, a little bit later, he calls me,

1160
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:14,260
他说  "妈  他们不让我进去看他"
and he says, "Mom, they won't let me in to see him."

1161
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:16,750
我问  "怎么会这样"
And I said, "Well, how come?"

1162
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,680
他们说  "因为我不是他的家属"
And they said, "Because I'm not family."

1163
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:20,900
我说  "天呐  谢恩"
And I just -- "Oh, my God, Shane."

1164
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:23,190
于是我打给了汤姆的母亲
So, I called Tom's mom.

1165
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,120
那时印第安纳州已是深夜
And it's, you know, late at night in Indiana.

1166
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:29,330
她一开口便问道
And, you know, the first thing she says was,

1167
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:31,190
"他喝了多少酒  谢恩"
"Well, how much was he drinking, Shane?"

1168
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,710
我能听到他爸在后面说
And then his dad, in the background, was saying,

1169
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:37,580
"他跑到屋顶上去做什么"
"Well, what the hell was he doing on the roof?"

1170
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:40,380
随后  我就把电话给了
And I just, from that point forward, I made sure

1171
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:44,130
在场的医护人员  让他们说了情况
to let the nursing staff or the doctors speak to her and to him.

1172
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:47,990
等了差不多一小时之后
And it had been probably about an hour later,

1173
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:50,600
医生来到我们的房间
the doctor came into the room,

1174
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:53,720
我立马就知道了
and, like, I just, I knew.

1175
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:02,570
我知道他要说些什么
Like, I knew what he was gonna say.

1176
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:05,680
当他开始讲话的时候
And when he was talking,

1177
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,890
我跟本什么都没听进去
like, it wasn't registering in my head.

1178
00:48:07,890 --> 00:48:10,630
好像左耳进右耳出
Like, I wasn't processing what he said.

1179
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:12,400
他说他没挺过来
He just said he didn't make it.

1180
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,490
真的非常...
And it was very, you know...

1181
00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:18,070
我们都失声痛哭
And we all just lost it.

1182
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:22,770
我必须离开那个房间  因为我真得听不下去
I had to just leave the room because I couldn't hear it.

1183
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:25,570
艾丽克斯一直在哭  她不停地做这个动作
Alex was crying, and she was continually doing this --

1184
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:28,410
我想她受了很大的打击
I think because she was just so traumatized.

1185
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:32,570
艾丽克斯的妈妈不停的说  "天呐"
And Alex's Mom was saying, "Oh, my god."

1186
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:33,960
"天呐"
"Oh, my god."

1187
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:36,680
或是  "他可怜的妈妈"
And sometimes she would say, "Oh, his mother."

1188
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:39,610
因为第二天就是母亲节
'Cause Mother's Day was the next day.

1189
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:41,010
于是我走出房间
So, I went outside.

1190
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:43,050
给我妈打了电话
I called my mom, and...

1191
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:49,780
我说  "妈  他走了"
And I was like, "Mom, he died."

1192
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:53,750
她说  "我很遗憾  谢恩"
And, you know, she just said, "I'm so sorry, Shane.

1193
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:55,120
"真的很遗憾"
I'm so sorry."

1194
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:56,920
他一直在哭  我也在哭
And he was just crying, and I'm crying.

1195
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:00,010
但再一次  你却在2400公里之外
And, you know, here you are, again, 1,500 miles away,

1196
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:01,530
无法陪着自己的孩子
and you can't be there for your child.

1197
00:49:01,530 --> 00:49:02,610
我接到了他的电话
I got ahold of him,

1198
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:08,280
说汤姆在医院里去世了
and Tom had just died in the hospital, and...

1199
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:12,880
我永远不想再回忆这个时刻
I don't know. It's not a moment I want to ever go through again.

1200
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:17,510
没有什么比这更痛苦
The worst pain I have ever felt in my heart.

1201
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:20,500
我的脑子一片空白
Like, I just sunk.

1202
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,670
我说  "你他妈开玩笑吧"
I just said, "Are you fucking kidding me?

1203
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:25,730
"真的吗"  我说  "真的吗  谁会这样死掉"
Seriously?" I said, "Seriously, who dies like that?"

1204
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:30,220
我以为在他断气的瞬间
I figured Shane was probably there when he passed,

1205
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:33,710
谢恩会陪在他床边  紧握他的手
by his bed, holding his hand.

1206
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:35,380
他却说没有
And he said no.

1207
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:38,410
于是我冲向护士站  我说
So, I went to the nurse's station, and I said,

1208
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:42,230
"我朋友的男朋友在这"
"You know, my friend's boyfriend is here.

1209
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:45,210
"他刚刚去世  能让他们见最后一面吗"
He just passed away. Can you take him back?"

1210
00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:49,360
她却说  "在他父母来这之前"
And she said, "We can't allow non-family members to see him

1211
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,900
"所有非亲属都不能见他"
until his parents arrive."

1212
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:53,210
于是我一直和护士争论
So I kept trying to argue with this nurse.

1213
00:49:53,210 --> 00:49:56,120
那位女士说  "亲爱的  我理解你的心情"
And the lady was like, "I understand, honey, I do.

1214
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:58,040
"但这有违医院规定"
But it's against the hospital rules.

1215
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:00,180
"他不是他的家属"  我说  "他就是他的家属"
He's not his family." I said, "But he is his family.

1216
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:02,630
"他们拥有一栋房子  拥有共同的事业"
They have a house together. They have a business together.

1217
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:03,810
"他们还有一条狗"
They have a dog together.

1218
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:05,690
"他们在一起六年了"
They've been together for six years."

1219
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:07,810
最后  我们坐在一个房间里
Finally, we were sitting a the room,

1220
00:50:07,810 --> 00:50:10,200
一位护士打开房门
and this one nurse opened the door,

1221
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:12,510
她问  "谢恩在这吗"
and she said, "Is Shane in here?"

1222
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:14,070
于是我们走出房间
And so we went outside,

1223
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:16,060
她拿着汤姆的驾驶证
and she was holding Tom's license,

1224
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:21,050
她说  "天呐  他真是个帅小伙"
And she said, "Man, he was a good-looking guy. Geez.

1225
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:24,720
"所有护士都在谈论他是多么的帅气"
And all the nurses back here are talking about how handsome he was,

1226
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:28,620
"我们刚才在努力让他恢复..."
and we've been working back here to try to kind of...

1227
00:50:30,370 --> 00:50:33,570
"恢复成你记忆中的样子"
make him look the way that you remember him.

1228
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:35,720
"跟我来  我们带你去见他"
Come with me. We're gonna take you back."

1229
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:39,910
我想  护士们最终弄明白了
I think, at the end of the day, the nurses knew,

1230
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:42,820
无论是同性恋
you know, it's not a gay thing.

1231
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:44,010
还是异性恋
It's not a straight thing.

1232
00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:45,560
不变的是爱情
It's a human thing.

1233
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:49,760
但那些护士给谢恩的
But it was definitely a gift, I think,

1234
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,430
绝对是上天的恩赐
that those women gave to Shane.

1235
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:55,600
于是我们来到了他病房
So, they walked back to his room.

1236
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:58,010
他浑身插满了管子
There was tubes all over his body,

1237
00:50:58,010 --> 00:50:59,890
管子直接插进他的胸部
tubes coming out of his chest.

1238
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:01,630
他的脸被盖了起来  但你仍能看到
His face was covered, but you could see that

1239
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:05,190
他的脸上满是血迹
there, you know, had been blood, like, all around his face.

1240
00:51:05,850 --> 00:51:10,250
我感觉这不是真的
And it didn't really seem like this was happening.

1241
00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:13,060
我在旁边站了一会儿
I just stood there for a while.

1242
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:15,040
不知道该做什么
I didn't know what to do.

1243
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:18,180
他全身上下我唯一能碰的地方
But the only place that I could put my hand

1244
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:19,850
就是他的腿
was like on his leg.

1245
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:23,770
于是最后一次  我在他腿上敲了三下
And I did, you know, one final "Tap, tap, tap."

昨晚在洛斯费利兹区
A man fell to his death

1262
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:08,410
{\pos(107.113,151.881)}意外坠亡

1263
00:53:06,090 --> 00:53:07,700
一名男士从四层高的公寓上
from a four-story apartment building

1264
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:09,790
意外坠亡
in Los Feliz last night.

1265
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:11,830
警方称他当时在为一名女士拍照
Police say he was taking pictures of a woman.

1266
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:13,230
警方排除了他杀可能
They don't suspect foul play,

1267
00:53:13,230 --> 00:53:15,710
称之为令人心痛的意外
and are calling his death a tragic accident.

1268
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:18,020
死者是一名演员兼电视主持人
He was an actor and TV host.

1269
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:22,420
我想不起汤姆去世后的那段日子是怎么过的
The days after Tom passed away are kind of a blur.

1270
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:23,900
我只想让家人
There was nothing I wanted more

1271
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:27,500
陪在我身边
than just to have my family there with me.

1272
00:53:27,930 --> 00:53:29,370
尽管我的父母离婚了
And so it really meant a lot

1273
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:31,390
但他们还是说
that my parents, although they're divorced,

1274
00:53:31,390 --> 00:53:32,390
"我们都会来陪你的"
that they were able to just say,

1275
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:34,300
这对我意义重大
"Look, like, we're gonna be there for you."

1276
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:36,860
我的姐妹们也说要来
And my sisters were going to, as well.

1277
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:41,500
我和我爸从艾丽克斯家里开回了汤姆的车
My dad and I, we went to go pick up Tom's car at Alex's place.

1278
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:44,210
在回家的路上
And during the car ride home,

1279
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:47,930
我们第一次讨论了我是同性恋这件事
we talked about me being gay for the first time.

1280
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:49,600
我想让他知道
I wanted him to know,

1281
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,230
尽管他出柜后我什么也没说
even though I had never said anything since he'd come out,

1282
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:53,820
但我全心全意地接受他
that I fully accepted him.

1283
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:58,240
我们甚至讨论了汤姆爸爸的感受
I think we even talked about how Tom's dad must feel,

1284
00:53:58,410 --> 00:54:00,870
因为汤姆的爸爸从未接受过汤姆
because Tom's dad never accepted Tom,

1285
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:04,140
我想让我儿子明白  我接受他
and I wanted it be known that I accepted my son.

1286
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:06,310
这是有史以来第一次
For the first time ever,

1287
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:09,120
我不介意告诉爸爸我是同性恋
I didn't care about telling my dad that I was gay.

1288
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,090
我不介意向他坦白
I didn't care about acknowledging

1289
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:13,010
我和汤姆在一起了
that Tom and I were in a relationship.

1290
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:15,900
我感到无所畏惧
I just felt, like, fearless.

1291
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:18,300
但这一切都没有意义了
But it didn't matter anymore.

1292
00:54:19,070 --> 00:54:20,540
汤姆已经走了
And Tom was gone.

1293
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:25,290
我去机场接了玛莎
So, I picked Martha up from the airport,

1294
00:54:25,290 --> 00:54:28,270
我们回到了家里
and we went to our house.

1295
00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:30,580
她想谈谈银行账户
She wanted to talk about bank accounts --

1296
00:54:31,210 --> 00:54:34,600
所有那些我不想提及的事
All these things that I did not want to talk about.

1297
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:38,630
我记得她一直四处打量房间
I remember her looking around the rooms a lot.

1298
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:41,980
我也不愿那样去想
And I didn't really want to think that way.

1299
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:45,720
但我觉得她只想翻看他的东西
I had the feeling that she just wanted to go through his stuff.

1300
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:47,980
她想翻弄谢恩和汤姆的所有衣物
She wanted to go through all of Shane and Tom's clothes.

1301
00:54:48,010 --> 00:54:49,960
他让她翻遍了所有抽屉
He let her go through all the drawers.

1302
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:52,950
她甚至想带走谢恩和汤姆共用的电脑
She tried to take the computers that were Shane and Tom's.

1303
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:55,180
就好像谢恩不存在一样
It was just like Shane didn't exist anymore.

1304
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:56,880
谢恩一直很配合她
Shane was more than willing to work with her,

1305
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,570
把她想要的汤姆的东西都给了她
give her anything she wanted of Tom's,

1306
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:03,530
但这侵犯了他的隐私
but it started to invade his privacy,

1307
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:05,080
而他对此毫不抱怨
and he wouldn't say anything.

1308
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:07,160
玛莎会就一些东西说三道四
Martha would make a comment about something,

1309
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:09,560
而谢恩则收起了一切感情
and Shane would just stuff the emotions away,

1310
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:11,750
就像小时候孩子们给他起外号时一样
like back when kids would call him names.

1311
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:13,520
我无权说任何话
I couldn't say anything, anyway.

1312
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:16,700
我无权阻止她
I had no legal right to stop her.

1313
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:20,010
汤姆的妈妈和我们一起
So, Tom's mom was waiting, along with us,

1314
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:22,040
等着验尸官移交他的遗体
for the coroner to release his body.

1315
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:24,600
介于这次意外的情况
Due to the circumstances of the accident,

1316
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,760
他的遗体必须进行尸检
they had to do an autopsy.

1317
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:28,540
我们开始讨论起葬礼的事
We started talking about the funeral.

1318
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:30,680
她说  不  我们都会被邀请参加
And she said that, no, we're all invited.

1319
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:32,590
我们可以住在他们家
We could stay at their house.

1320
00:55:32,590 --> 00:55:34,090
作为家属出席葬礼
You know, "Come as a family.

1321
00:55:34,090 --> 00:55:36,360
我们会一起举行葬礼
We'll just do all this together."

1322
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:41,210
她一直在说  "我要带我的宝贝回家"
She was very, you know, "I'm taking my baby home.

1323
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:43,710
"你们都要来  我希望你们出席"
You guys are all coming with. I want you to be there."

1324
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:45,050
然而随着一天天的等待
And then, as the days go on,

1325
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:47,340
她不再谈论葬礼的事
she pretty much quit talking about the funeral

1326
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:48,530
不再提我们出席葬礼
and about us all going

1327
00:55:48,530 --> 00:55:53,060
与东部家乡的亲人一起悼念汤姆的事
and sharing Tom with everybody back east.

1328
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:55,850
汤姆的母亲待在另一个房间
Tom's mom was in the other room or even sometimes

1329
00:55:55,850 --> 00:55:58,420
甚至有时就坐在我旁边策划葬礼
right next to me making the funeral arrangements

1330
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:02,760
却不让我参与其中
and planning it all out, and I was not a part of it.

1331
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:05,650
好像我是空气  是幽灵
It was like I wasn't there. It was like I was a ghost.

1332
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,310
她是一位刚刚失去儿子的母亲
She was a mother who'd just lost her son --

1333
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:10,060
她那20多岁的儿子
her 20-something-year-old son --

1334
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:14,250
除了悲伤  你不能指望她有其他的情绪
So there were no expectations other than grief.

1335
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:18,020
但我没想到她会伤害谢恩
But I didn't think that she was gonna hurt Shane.

1336
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:20,470
我以为她爱谢恩
I thought that she loved Shane.

1337
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:24,770
我觉得肯定有什么不对劲
The feeling I got was something was awry,

1338
00:56:24,770 --> 00:56:27,500
但没人会指责她
but nobody could put their finger on it.

1339
00:56:27,530 --> 00:56:29,090
然后到了周四早上
And then, that Thursday morning,

1340
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:30,220
玛莎突然说  "我要离开了"
Martha was like, "I got to go."

1341
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,820
谢恩说  "我开车送你去机场"
And Shane's like, "I'll drive you to the airport."

1342
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:33,170
她说  "不  我坐出租车"
She's like, "No, I'll get a taxi."

1343
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:35,740
我告诉她  "我不会让你坐出租车的"
I told her, "I'm not gonna let you take a taxi."

1344
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:37,480
我有一种预感
I kind of had a feeling

1345
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:40,110
她知道一些我不知道的事情
that she knew something that I didn't know,

1346
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:44,210
她知道汤姆的遗体随时可以移交
that she knew that his body was gonna be released any moment.

1347
00:56:44,230 --> 00:56:48,000
她打包了汤姆的所有衣物
She was packing all Tom's clothes up

1348
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:49,420
好让其陪着他长眠于地下
that she was gonna bury him in,

1349
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:51,380
而她准备给他遗体穿上的夹克
and the jacket that she wanted to put him in

1350
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:53,600
则没有放进行李箱
was not fitting in the suitcase.

1351
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:55,190
谢恩说  "没关系  玛莎"
And Shane's like, "It's okay, Martha.

1352
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:57,220
"我到时候带过去"  但她却说  "不"
I'll just bring it." And she was like, "No.

1353
00:56:57,220 --> 00:56:58,630
"绝对不行"
Absolutely not."

1354
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,760
现在回过头看
So, maybe looking back now,

1355
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:05,860
那可能就是要发生的事件的征兆
it could have been foreshadowing what could have happened,

1356
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:07,020
她那时候就知道
that she knew then

1357
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:09,820
她不会让谢恩参加葬礼
that she wasn't gonna let Shane come to the funeral.

1358
00:57:10,070 --> 00:57:13,070
我把她送到目的地  拥抱了她
And I dropped her off, and we hugged.

1359
00:57:13,290 --> 00:57:16,140
请求她有什么情况及时通知我
And I asked her to please keep me updated

1360
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:17,240
以便我知晓那边的情况
so I know what's happening,

1361
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:19,340
她答应我会那样做
and she promised me that she would.

1362
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:22,660
但是我再也没有听到她的消息
But I never heard from her again.

1363
00:57:23,410 --> 00:57:26,130
她很感激我们为她儿子做的一切
She was so grateful and so loving towards us

1364
00:57:26,130 --> 00:57:27,920
她对我们十分友善
for everything that we did for her son.

1365
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:31,130
她一直哭  拥抱我们  拉着我们的手
She just was crying and hugging us and holding on to us

1366
00:57:31,130 --> 00:57:33,400
说什么"我希望成为你们生活的一部分"
and, "I want to be a part of your life.

1367
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,020
"我想常来拜访"
I want to come visit."

1368
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:38,230
感觉我们和她建立了感情
It was like we were bonded with her.

1369
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:40,510
到了第二天  她就不见了
And then, the next day, she was gone.

1370
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:44,110
汤姆去世的第二天  我跟他妈妈通过话
I talked to Tom's mom the day after he died.

1371
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:45,550
她说  "一旦葬礼定好时间"
And she said, "I'll let you know

1372
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:47,920
"我会及时通知你"
as soon as I know when the funeral is gonna be

1373
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:48,720
"好让你能够出席"
so that you can be there."

1374
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:51,200
之后就什么动静也没有了
Then, it was pretty much radio silence.

1375
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,720
他们没回电告诉我葬礼什么时候举行
They never called me back to tell me when it was,

1376
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,130
我很受伤
and I was very hurt.

1377
00:57:54,130 --> 00:57:55,900
我看到了报纸上的告示
I see the notice in the newspaper --

1378
00:57:54,980 --> 00:58:02,060
{\an8}他去世后留下了父母诺曼和玛莎  姐姐金和哥哥大卫
可通过殡仪馆向此家庭捐赠

1379
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:58,200
守灵是当天  葬礼是第二天
Wake is this day. Funeral is the next day.

1380
00:57:58,350 --> 00:58:02,390
我给汤姆家打电话确认
I called Tom's house to verify,

1381
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:05,920
接电话的亲戚说
and, you know, the relative who answered just said,

1382
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:06,950
"如果报纸上这么说"
"If that's what the paper says,

1383
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:08,570
"那应该没错"
then I would probably go by that."

1384
00:58:08,570 --> 00:58:11,100
之后我亲自给
And I personally called back

1385
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:14,060
他家乡不同的太平间打电话
to different mortuaries in his hometown

1386
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:15,580
试图确认这一消息
to try to get information,

1387
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:17,960
可没人愿意告诉我们
and nobody would give us any information.

1388
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:20,730
尽管我们再没听到玛莎的回音
So, although I never heard from Martha,

1389
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:24,720
我妈妈  艾丽克斯和我还是订了机票
my mom and Alex and I, we all booked our plane tickets.

1390
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:25,370
在中途停留时
During our layover,

1391
00:58:25,370 --> 00:58:28,290
我接到了汤姆亲戚打来的电话
I received a phone call from one of Tom's relatives.

1392
00:58:28,290 --> 00:58:30,390
她告诉我
And she wanted to let me know

1393
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:33,820
汤姆的葬礼不欢迎我
that I wasn't welcome to attend his funeral,

1394
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:35,490
如果我出席
because, if I do show up,

1395
00:58:35,490 --> 00:58:38,690
汤姆的叔叔和父亲将对我进行人身攻击
his uncle and his father had planned an attack.

1396
00:58:39,110 --> 00:58:40,370
她想让我知道
and she wanted me to know

1397
00:58:40,370 --> 00:58:44,220
为了我的人身安全  我不应该出席
that it's for my own safety that I don't go.

1398
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:46,660
我就想  "难道他们要对他开枪吗"
All I could think of -- "Are they gonna shoot him?

1399
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:48,230
"他们要杀了我的儿子吗"
Are they gonna kill my son?"

1400
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:51,670
当我们到了印第安纳州
When we got into Indiana,

1401
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:53,720
汤姆的好友来接我们
one of Tom's best friends picked us up.

1402
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:55,610
艾丽克斯的情绪有些激动
And Alex was hysterical.

1403
00:58:55,610 --> 00:58:59,210
离诺克斯市越近  她越抓狂
And the closer we got to Knox, the more hysterical she got.

1404
00:58:59,210 --> 00:59:02,330
她一直说"我已经失去了汤姆  我不想再失去你"
And she was saying, "I lost tom. I don't want to lose you, also."

1405
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:03,590
我害怕
I was terrified

1406
00:59:03,590 --> 00:59:07,270
他们会对谢恩开枪
that they were gonna come and pull out a gun on Shane.

1407
00:59:07,270 --> 00:59:10,290
我记得他[谢恩]说过不止一次
I remember him saying more than once,

1408
00:59:10,290 --> 00:59:12,140
"他们很伤心"
"You know, they're in a lot of pain.

1409
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:14,190
"伤心难过的不只是我"
It's not just me that's going through this,"

1410
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:17,800
几乎是在为他们辩解  有点让人受不了
and almost arguing for them, which was maddening.

1411
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,380
我是说换了我  我会很生气
I mean, I'd be angry --

1412
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,490
会说些"你们不能这样对我"之类的话
"You're not gonna do this to me."

1413
00:59:21,550 --> 00:59:24,340
但他没有  他没有如此回应
Nope. He didn't respond that way.

1414
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:29,080
我们找了个秘密地点  商量出了对策
We had a secret location to come up with a plan about,

1415
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:32,000
那就是不去打扰他们
you know, just kind of staying out of their way.

1416
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:35,460
尽管我不能去教堂
And even though I couldn't be in the church,

1417
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:38,210
我还是希望能尽可能的接近汤姆
Like, I still wanted to be as close as I could to Tom.

1418
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:42,340
离他近一点  也算是一种宽慰
You know, just being near was somehow comforting.

1419
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:44,450
当我知道
Once I realized

1420
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:47,350
谢恩被拒绝参加葬礼
that Shane had been banned from attending the funeral,

1421
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:48,420
我便意识到
I realized that's why

1422
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:50,680
他们为何会对具体情况只字不提
they weren't telling anybody when things were.

1423
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:53,840
他们不想让任何消息走漏出去
They basically were keeping all the information close-hold

1424
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,510
以阻止谢恩出席
so that Shane couldn't get there.

01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:22,600
上面盖着柯尔沃毯子

01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:39,520
我脑中所想就是

01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:41,460
"为了谢恩  我得亲吻棺材"
"I have to kiss the casket for Shane."

1442
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:46,300
我走到棺材旁边  亲吻了它
And I made my way over to the casket, and I kissed it,

1443
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:49,030
低声说道"谢恩爱你"
and I whispered, you know, "Shane loves you."

1444
01:00:49,030 --> 01:00:51,040
葬礼上描述的汤姆
The funeral depicted Tom

1445
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:53,450
基本上剔除了他去加州后的人生
up until the point where he left for California, basically.

1446
01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:56,470
发言人都是些汤姆童年时代的人
And the speakers were all from Tom's childhood.

1447
01:00:56,470 --> 01:00:58,020
他的钢琴老师
You know, it was his piano teacher

1448
01:00:58,020 --> 01:00:59,210
以及柯尔沃的人
and people from Culver.

1449
01:00:59,210 --> 01:01:03,900
我从2000级送的花束中拿走了几支花
I took the flowers from the bouquet that the class of 2000 sent,

1450
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:06,360
将其风干  以便我能送给谢恩
and I dried them so I could give those to Shane.

1451
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:07,770
我给他留了份葬礼流程单
And I saved him a program

1452
01:01:07,770 --> 01:01:10,590
因为他是汤姆此身的挚爱
because, you know, he is the love of Tom's life.

1453
01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:12,330
他值得拥有这些东西
He at least deserves that.

1454
01:01:12,330 --> 01:01:14,690
不幸的是  其中并有没提及他
Unfortunately, he wasn't mentioned in it.

1455
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:18,480
做了将近30年的亲人
Families, for literally 30 years,

1456
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:21,630
可以藏匿秘密  直到有人死去
can sweep that secret under the rug until someone dies,

1457
01:01:21,630 --> 01:01:23,950
你只得面对现实
and then you have to really face the music.

1458
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:26,620
我认为汤姆的父母就是这样
And I think that's what happened to Tom's parents.

1459
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:28,770
他们有个很棒的孩子
They had this great child.

1460
01:01:28,770 --> 01:01:33,890
他聪明  有才华  有很多正能量
He was smart and talented -- lots of positive things.

1461
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:35,600
但有一个积极的方面
But the one positive thing

1462
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:38,070
他们不愿向亲友吹捧的是
that they didn't want to brag to their friends about

1463
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:41,560
汤姆有个出色的伴侣
is that Tom had an amazing partner,

1464
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:43,190
他们因此感到羞耻
'cause they were ashamed.

1465
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:44,310
所以他们所做的是
And so what they did

1466
01:01:44,310 --> 01:01:46,490
将其从历史中抹去
is they literally erased it from the history books

1467
01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:49,480
该内容现在无法显示

1468
01:01:46,490 --> 01:01:48,460
比如关闭他的Facebook账户
by shutting down his facebook page,

1469
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:50,130
拒绝让谢恩出席葬礼
by disinviting Shane to the funeral,

1470
01:01:50,130 --> 01:01:51,500
甚至在葬礼上对谢恩只字不提
to not even mentioning him there,

1471
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:53,620
这大概是对一个人的记忆
which is the most insulting thing

1472
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:56,130
最具侮辱性的举动
anyone could ever do to a person's memory.

1473
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:58,800
他们不是反对同性恋婚姻
They're not fighting against gay marriage.

1474
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,600
他们不是反对有一个同性恋儿子
They're not fighting against having a gay son.

1475
01:02:00,610 --> 01:02:02,800
他们是在反对爱情
What they're fighting against is love,

1476
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,510
谁会反对爱情
And who fights against love?
