1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,716
往昔

2
00:00:01,716 --> 00:00:03,630
牧師Boyle帶領你走向光輝時刻
Reverend Buddy Boyle Going For Glowing Hour

3
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:05,142
當天使降臨 
When angels come and knock in

4
00:00:06,063 --> 00:00:07,080
奉獻出的你軀殼吧
Let them all in

5
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,244
沒有人類的許可 天使是無法附身的對吧
Angels can't possess a human without permission,right

6
00:00:09,244 --> 00:00:09,717
沒錯
Yep

7
00:00:09,717 --> 00:00:11,992
所以天使們用這傢伙寸照容器嗎
So,what?They're using this guy to find vessels

8
00:00:11,992 --> 00:00:13,055
有一大堆心甘情願的觀眾啊
It's a willing audiance

9
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:14,138
是誰讓Crowley掌握大權的
Who put Crowley in charge

10
00:00:14,138 --> 00:00:15,175
他可是我們的王
He's the King

11
00:00:15,175 --> 00:00:16,220
他只是個商人
He's a salesman

12
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:19,926
現在
Right now

13
00:00:19,926 --> 00:00:22,127
咱們來談談更朝換代
You and I have to talk about the regime change

14
00:00:22,127 --> 00:00:23,110
你是我們的了
You're ours

15
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:24,499
你這個混蛋惡魔
Your demon ass

16
00:00:24,499 --> 00:00:26,079
馬上就要變成個混蛋人類了
Is going to be a mortal ass

17
00:00:26,376 --> 00:00:27,520
一眨眼的事兒
It'll be damn quick

18
00:00:27,964 --> 00:00:30,501
我要怎樣
Where do I start

19
00:00:30,617 --> 00:00:33,861
才能求得寬恕
To even look for forgiveness

20
00:00:33,861 --> 00:00:35,198
不如從這個開始
How about we start with this

21
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:39,066
你變成凡人了嗎
You're human

22
00:00:40,881 --> 00:00:41,451
Zeke
Zeke

23
00:00:41,451 --> 00:00:42,845
Castiel不能留在這兒
Castiel cannot stay here

24
00:00:42,845 --> 00:00:44,591
他會把天使們都引到這裏的
He'll bring the angels down to all of us

25
00:00:44,591 --> 00:00:45,208
他能避開天使
He's warded

26
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:46,935
但他還是被April找到了
He was warded when April found him

27
00:00:46,935 --> 00:00:48,101
Castiel有危險
Castiel is in danger

28
00:00:48,101 --> 00:00:48,982
如果他在這兒
And if he's here

29
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:50,576
我就有危險
I am in danger

30
00:00:50,576 --> 00:00:51,263
等等 你怎麼會有危險
Wait,you're in danger

31
00:00:51,263 --> 00:00:52,201
如果他留下
If he stays

32
00:00:53,172 --> 00:00:55,105
恐怕我就只能離開了
I'm afraid I'll have no choice but to leave

33
00:00:55,134 --> 00:00:56,340
Cass 咱們需要談一談
Cass can we talk

34
00:00:56,593 --> 00:00:57,449
你不能留在這兒
You can't stay

35
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:06,539
雷克斯福德 愛達荷州

36
00:01:06,837 --> 00:01:08,934
先生 先生 你在聽嗎
Sir,sir can you hear me

37
00:01:09,305 --> 00:01:11,147
麻煩您說點兒什麼
Please,please just say something

38
00:01:11,443 --> 00:01:12,482
你還在嗎
Are you still there

39
00:01:12,764 --> 00:01:14,877
隨便說點兒什麼 我可以幫你
Keep talking and I can help you through this

40
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,757
求你了 先生 如果你還在聽
Please,sir,if you can hear me

41
00:01:16,757 --> 00:01:18,165
請別掛斷電話
Stay on the phone

42
00:01:18,467 --> 00:01:20,123
你現在可能很絕望 但是
It may feel hopeless right now but

43
00:01:20,123 --> 00:01:22,397
你打這個熱線是有原因的
But you call the hotline for a reason

44
00:01:22,397 --> 00:01:24,351
在你內心深處 還是有求生慾望的
There's some part of you that still want to live

45
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:26,193
還是知道自殺
Some parts that know suicide

46
00:02:06,966 --> 00:02:07,839
你是誰
Who are you

47
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,999
是熱線電話裏那位女士叫你來的嗎
Did the lady from the hotline send you

48
00:02:12,328 --> 00:02:13,073
不
No

49
00:02:15,676 --> 00:02:16,644
是你叫我來的
You did

50
00:03:04,828 --> 00:03:05,886
來擊個掌
High five

51
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:14,930
早啊 Steve
Morning,Steve

52
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:15,640
快遞
Mail

53
00:03:15,734 --> 00:03:17,825
擊 個掌
High five

54
00:03:26,293 --> 00:03:27,446
抱歉 我來晚了
Sorry,I'm late

55
00:03:27,487 --> 00:03:29,901
我得把孩子送到育兒所
I had to drop the baby off at the daycare

56
00:03:29,901 --> 00:03:32,001
一路上淨是紅燈
Then hit every red lights on the way here but

57
00:03:32,644 --> 00:03:33,878
看來我不需要擔心什麼
Guess I should've worried

58
00:03:34,332 --> 00:03:35,230
店面看起來不錯
Place looks great

59
00:03:35,911 --> 00:03:36,841
咖啡杯
Coffee urns

60
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:37,430
滿的
Full

61
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,326
牛奶呢
Dairy case

62
00:03:38,688 --> 00:03:39,172
都裝好了
Stocked

63
00:03:39,172 --> 00:03:39,728
好吧
Okay

64
00:03:39,728 --> 00:03:40,839
最後一個問題
Steve,last questions

65
00:03:41,271 --> 00:03:42,591
從前你都去哪兒了
Where have you been all my life

66
00:03:44,581 --> 00:03:46,561
你跟其他的銷售助理不大一樣
You're not like the other sales associates

67
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:49,535
你有些 不一樣的地方
There's something different about you

68
00:03:49,703 --> 00:03:51,503
我能保證我沒有
I can assure you there's not

69
00:03:51,619 --> 00:03:52,653
我懂
I know these things

70
00:03:53,614 --> 00:03:54,433
你
You're

71
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:57,320
你很特別
You're special

72
00:04:11,756 --> 00:04:13,574
你的大好消息就是
That's your big news is that

73
00:04:13,574 --> 00:04:16,435
把預言石翻譯成了塗鴉嗎
You translated the tablets into doodles

74
00:04:16,606 --> 00:04:17,876
是楔形文字
It's Cuneiform

75
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,757
我沒辦法直接把預言石翻譯成英語
I hit a wall translating the tablet into English

76
00:04:21,757 --> 00:04:23,509
但是我發現了一本古老的手抄本
But I find an ancient codex

77
00:04:23,509 --> 00:04:24,996
能把天使文翻譯成
Linking the angel script to

78
00:04:25,392 --> 00:04:27,057
古埃蘭楔形文字
Proto-Elamite Cuneiform and

79
00:04:27,057 --> 00:04:29,240
於是我就能把預言石板和筆記
I was able to translate the tablets and the footnotes

80
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,557
都翻譯成古埃蘭文 但是它們
Into Elamite which is

81
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:32,478
是塗鴉
Doodles

82
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,758
早就滅絕了
It's extinct

83
00:04:34,657 --> 00:04:35,584
你能認出這些字嗎
Can you read it

84
00:04:35,845 --> 00:04:36,659
沒人能
No one cans

85
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:38,171
學者們已經研究好幾個世紀了
Scholars have tried for centuries

86
00:04:38,571 --> 00:04:39,605
所以 這是個死胡同
So,it's an dead end

87
00:04:40,387 --> 00:04:41,981
不完全是
And not quite

88
00:04:42,433 --> 00:04:45,304
大多數古埃蘭文字都是抽像的
Now,most Proto-Elamite is abstract

89
00:04:45,341 --> 00:04:47,262
但我從Metatron的筆記裏
But I was able to decipher one phrase

90
00:04:47,262 --> 00:04:48,597
認出了一個詞
From Metatron's footnotes

91
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:49,870
墜落的天使
Falling angels

92
00:04:51,346 --> 00:04:52,424
這麼說
Okay,so

93
00:04:53,247 --> 00:04:55,925
那些筆記涉及到了Metatron的咒語
The footnotes refer to Metatron's spell

94
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,843
有可能
Maybe

95
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:00,608
好吧
Okay

96
00:05:01,215 --> 00:05:03,724
要是我們能翻譯出筆記
Well,maybe if we can decipher the footnotes

97
00:05:03,724 --> 00:05:06,025
也許就能逆轉咒語
Then we can reverse the spell

98
00:05:06,025 --> 00:05:07,766
讓那幫長翅膀的混蛋滾回天堂
Punt those wingy dicks back to Heaven

99
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:09,529
從哪兒入手
Where do we start

100
00:05:09,764 --> 00:05:10,690
查資料
Research

101
00:05:12,518 --> 00:05:13,739
泡泡圖書館
Comb through the library

102
00:05:13,739 --> 00:05:15,921
看看能不能找到埃蘭文的資料
See if you can find anything else on Elamite

103
00:05:18,765 --> 00:05:21,207
Zimmerman滅絕語言大百科
Zimmerman's Encyclopedia of Extinct Languages

104
00:05:21,207 --> 00:05:24,289
第一卷 Adai到Adakapa
Volume 1:Adai to Adakapa

105
00:05:25,145 --> 00:05:26,362
這玩意兒一共多少卷
How many volumes are there

106
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:27,565
24卷
24

107
00:05:29,298 --> 00:05:30,630
別擔心 一卷都沒丟
Don't worry,we've got them all

108
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,313
太棒了
Awesome

109
00:05:37,095 --> 00:05:37,914
太及時了
There's a God

110
00:05:40,447 --> 00:05:41,267
喂
Hello

111
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:43,344
我這兒有個案子
I may have a case for you

112
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,582
愛達荷州 雷克斯福德市
Four were missing in Rexford Idaho

113
00:05:45,582 --> 00:05:46,780
有四例失蹤人口 疑似死亡
Presumed dead,you know

114
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,489
屍體很奇特
Body's been released a lovelies

115
00:05:48,824 --> 00:05:50,510
而且案發現場
And there were reports of

116
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,208
還發現了一種奇怪的物質
A strange substance at the scenes

117
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:55,055
我也很高興聯繫上你 Cass
Well,hello to you,too Cass

118
00:05:55,227 --> 00:05:56,083
你最近怎麼樣
How are you

119
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,768
我 很忙
I am busy

120
00:05:59,696 --> 00:06:01,152
好吧 那你想怎麼入手調查
All right,so how do you want to do this

121
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,654
跟你在現場見 還是我去接你
Want to meet you at the latest scene or want me to pick you up

122
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,038
我現在很忙
I've got my hands full over here

123
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:09,756
我只是
I just

124
00:06:10,768 --> 00:06:11,960
Cass 你還在嗎
Cass,hello

125
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:13,874
覺得你想瞭解一下案情
Thought you'd want to know about the case

126
00:06:15,384 --> 00:06:16,609
嘿 你確定一切都正
Hey,you sure everything is

127
00:06:18,591 --> 00:06:19,580
常嗎
Kay

128
00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:21,726
他沒說自己在哪兒
So he said nothing about where he is

129
00:06:21,726 --> 00:06:22,981
也沒提他都幹了什麼是嗎
Or what he's been doing

130
00:06:23,524 --> 00:06:24,378
這可是Cass
This is Cass

131
00:06:24,378 --> 00:06:26,334
他可從來都不擅長聊天
In case you forgot he's not exactly chatty Cathy

132
00:06:26,334 --> 00:06:28,014
你也不準備在愛達荷州去見見他嗎
And you're not even gonna see him when you're in Idaho

133
00:06:28,072 --> 00:06:30,179
我說過了 只要天使看見他就像貓看見貓薄荷一樣
Like I said,as long as he's on his catnip for angels

134
00:06:30,204 --> 00:06:31,708
他就要刻意跟咱們保持距離
He's keeping a distance

135
00:06:33,247 --> 00:06:34,110
所以
So

136
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,663
這一切有什麼意義嗎 Dean
Then what's the point,Dean

137
00:06:35,663 --> 00:06:37,222
這都不算我們管的案子啊
I mean,it's barely even case

138
00:06:37,293 --> 00:06:39,909
所以我這就上路 去看看他怎麼樣
That's why I'm gonna go and have a little look see

139
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:41,738
我才不會把所有精力都浪費在
And I'm not gonna waste the whole of the menpower 

140
00:06:41,738 --> 00:06:43,040
一堆沒用的破爛上
On a big pile of nada

141
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,117
你就是找借口
In other words,a perfect excuse

142
00:06:44,117 --> 00:06:46,114
不想查資料
To bail out on research

143
00:06:46,567 --> 00:06:47,502
被你發現了
You got me

144
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:53,025
嘿 Steve
Hey,Steve

145
00:06:53,404 --> 00:06:55,513
我在儲物櫃裏發現了這個
I found this in the supply closet

146
00:06:55,513 --> 00:06:56,945
你知道這是誰的嗎
Do you know whose it is

147
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,147
是我的
That's mine

148
00:07:02,878 --> 00:07:04,061
謝謝
Thanks

149
00:07:06,773 --> 00:07:11,133
我還在儲物格子了發現了一卷睡袋
I also found a roll of sleeping bag on the tool locker

150
00:07:11,393 --> 00:07:14,738
是的 我想仔細把存貨清單都查一遍
Yes I wanted to be thourough with inventory so

151
00:07:14,738 --> 00:07:16,561
所以上週末加班有點兒晚
I worked late last weekend

152
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,646
在這兒睡上一覺
Taking a nap here was easier than

153
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,172
比回家在床上睡方便多了
Going back home to my bed

154
00:07:20,747 --> 00:07:24,956
當然 我有床 也有家
Which I have,of course,a bed in home

155
00:07:25,104 --> 00:07:29,104
Steve 你真是太負責任了
Steve,you're so responsible

156
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:33,942
我一直沒好意思問
I've been afraid to ask

157
00:07:35,328 --> 00:07:38,448
我不想仗著你是我員工就佔你便宜
I don't want to take advantage of you as my employee

158
00:07:39,336 --> 00:07:40,997
我也不想破壞
And I certainly don't want to jeopardize

159
00:07:40,997 --> 00:07:42,390
咱們的同事關係
Our working relationship

160
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:45,047
但是作為一個單親媽媽
But as a working single mom,it's

161
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,416
約會是一件可遇不可求的事情
Hard enough to get a date

162
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,783
我碰上了一個這麼好的男人
Let alone meet a really great guy

163
00:07:50,322 --> 00:07:51,603
明天晚上我休假
Tomorrow is my night off

164
00:07:51,603 --> 00:07:53,643
我知道你也休假
And I know you're off too

165
00:07:53,643 --> 00:07:55,940
所以我在想有沒有可能
And I was just wondering if there's any chance

166
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,497
明晚你有時間嗎
That you're free tomorrow night

167
00:08:00,676 --> 00:08:01,670
當然有
Yes

168
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,002
非常有
Yes

169
00:08:06,717 --> 00:08:07,717
你真好
You're the best

170
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,023
所以 有四個人失蹤
So,four missing

171
00:08:23,023 --> 00:08:24,167
四個都死了
Four dead

172
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,819
死亡已經證實了
Just got confirmation

173
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:30,168
四個受害者有什麼共同的敵人嗎
And any common threat you can think of

174
00:08:31,796 --> 00:08:35,124
Joe的速撥通訊錄上有自殺開導熱線
Joe in there had a suicide hot line on speed dial

175
00:08:35,926 --> 00:08:37,340
上一個失蹤的女孩
And the gal before him

176
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,277
生病在家 抽屜裏收集的抗憂鬱藥
Was a shut-in who had enough anti-depressants

177
00:08:39,277 --> 00:08:41,786
多得能開藥店了
In her medicion cabinet to stock a pharmacy

178
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:43,168
一號受害者
First victims

179
00:08:43,168 --> 00:08:44,926
是蘇格市的一對夫妻
Maried a couple out of sugar city

180
00:08:44,926 --> 00:08:47,743
以和諧離婚而出名
Pretty much a walking billboard for no fault divorce

181
00:08:47,743 --> 00:08:49,383
他們生活上都不是很順心嗎
Were they all basket cases

182
00:08:49,672 --> 00:08:51,358
如果你讓我列出
If you ask me to make a list 

183
00:08:51,358 --> 00:08:53,030
本地最悲觀的人
Of this county saddest sacks

184
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,799
他們四個絕對是打頭的
These four will be right on the top

185
00:08:55,621 --> 00:08:57,267
好吧 四個不開心的受害人
All right,so four unhappy people

186
00:08:57,267 --> 00:08:58,787
其中一個有自殺傾向
One of them definitely suicidal

187
00:08:58,787 --> 00:09:00,106
但是你已經排除自殺了
But you've ruled out suicide

188
00:09:03,561 --> 00:09:05,185
你會需要它們的
You are goona want to put these on

189
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:23,335
這看起來像是自殺嗎
This look like suicide to you

190
00:09:26,722 --> 00:09:27,746
血跡嗎
Blood

191
00:09:27,746 --> 00:09:30,314
如果實驗結果跟其他前幾個一樣的話
If the tests come back same as the others

192
00:09:30,714 --> 00:09:31,801
這是所有東西
It's everything

193
00:09:31,801 --> 00:09:34,786
血液 皮膚 毛髮 指甲 內臟
Blood,skin,hair,nails internal organs

194
00:09:34,786 --> 00:09:36,234
甚至還有衣料
Even clothing fibres

195
00:09:36,234 --> 00:09:37,925
就像他們自己鑽進了
Like these poor souls,got run to the

196
00:09:37,925 --> 00:09:40,037
世界上最好的碎木機一樣
World's finest wood-chipper

197
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,309
有沒有目擊者
What about witnesses

198
00:09:41,486 --> 00:09:42,772
跟其他案件一樣
Same as the rest

199
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:46,158
鄰居們說有什麼 一陣粉紅色的光
Neighbors reported some kind of a pink flash

200
00:09:46,158 --> 00:09:47,551
我們到這兒的時候
By the time we got here

201
00:09:47,551 --> 00:09:49,833
這就是所有剩下的東西了
All that was left was this

202
00:09:52,702 --> 00:09:54,925
我們基本都查過了
Yeah,we're almost through texts over here

203
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,028
什麼都沒發現
We got nothing

204
00:09:57,028 --> 00:09:58,532
也許你應該試試打給Morrison教授
Maybe try professor Morrison

205
00:09:58,532 --> 00:09:59,954
我們聯繫不上他
Yeah,he's unreachable

206
00:09:59,954 --> 00:10:02,475
他休假了 去新幾內亞
He took a sabbatical to live amongst

207
00:10:02,475 --> 00:10:04,898
愉快地玩耍了
The Trobrianders of Papus New Guinea

208
00:10:04,898 --> 00:10:06,779
我們現在陷入了僵局
Needless to say,we are pretty burned

209
00:10:06,947 --> 00:10:08,098
還有一個人
Well,there's one guy there

210
00:10:08,098 --> 00:10:09,866
每天都沒事幹
Who's nothing notify-rested

211
00:10:09,866 --> 00:10:10,698
你是說Crowley嗎
Crowley

212
00:10:10,698 --> 00:10:11,484
我就是說說
I'm just saying

213
00:10:11,484 --> 00:10:13,547
把他綁著又不是為了好玩兒
We're not keeping him chained up for the one liners

214
00:10:13,547 --> 00:10:15,043
值得一試
That's worth a shot I guess

215
00:10:15,043 --> 00:10:15,762
小心行事
Just be careful all right

216
00:10:15,762 --> 00:10:17,675
別被他的小伎倆耍了
Don't fall for his quid pro quo crap

217
00:10:17,675 --> 00:10:18,457
知道了
Noted

218
00:10:18,457 --> 00:10:19,770
你怎麼樣
So what about you

219
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,657
Cass給的線索有什麼進展嗎
How's Cass's lead panning out

220
00:10:21,657 --> 00:10:23,230
四個受害人 突然爆炸至死
Four victims suddenly exploded

221
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,441
我測過電磁場
Now I've tried the EMF

222
00:10:24,441 --> 00:10:26,128
也找過巫術袋或者硫磺
I've looked for the hex bag,sulfer

223
00:10:26,128 --> 00:10:26,958
什麼都沒有
Nada

224
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,199
人體自燃嗎
Spontaneous combustion

225
00:10:28,199 --> 00:10:29,026
圖勒人幹的嗎
Maybe the Thules

226
00:10:29,026 --> 00:10:29,691
不不
No,no

227
00:10:29,691 --> 00:10:30,697
我已經把它們排除了
I already ruled them out

228
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:32,538
屍體是蒸發了 不是燒燬了
The bodies were vaporised,weren't burned

229
00:10:32,538 --> 00:10:34,303
聽起來是我們管的案子
That sounds like a real case

230
00:10:34,303 --> 00:10:35,471
Dean 我應該跟你一起
Dean,I should be there

231
00:10:35,471 --> 00:10:38,492
不了 沒有必要
No,man,that's not nessacary

232
00:10:38,733 --> 00:10:39,700
不用了 我
No,I

233
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:41,498
我自己能搞定
I got this one covered

234
00:10:50,969 --> 00:10:52,249
他甩了我 Jace
He dumped me,Jace

235
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,150
在食堂裏
In the cafeteria

236
00:10:54,628 --> 00:10:55,712
當著所有人的面
In front of everyone

237
00:10:56,304 --> 00:10:59,000
實在是 誰會這麼做啊
It's just like,who does that,you know

238
00:10:59,345 --> 00:11:00,914
為什麼不能在Facebook上把我甩了呢
Why can't he just dump me on facebook

239
00:11:00,914 --> 00:11:02,226
像個正常人那樣
Like a normal person

240
00:11:04,509 --> 00:11:06,149
我完蛋了
I've been destroyed

241
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,724
無論是社交上還是情感上
Socially and romantically

242
00:11:08,849 --> 00:11:09,786
完全的失敗者

243
00:11:12,669 --> 00:11:14,781
我想鑽地洞了 Jace
Just so embarrassed,Jace

244
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,868
都有心去死了
I'd just die

見到你我很驚訝
And you surprised me

255
00:11:59,703 --> 00:12:01,182
不瞞你說 我也很驚訝
Well,the feeling is mutual

256
00:12:01,182 --> 00:12:03,142
我知道我們要低調
Man,we had to lay low for the angel threat

257
00:12:03,142 --> 00:12:05,217
但是 哇哦 你這掩護身份真成功
But...Whoa,this is some cover

258
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:10,870
我沒有榮光了 你覺得會怎麼樣
My grace's gone.What did you expect

259
00:12:11,788 --> 00:12:14,100
你知不知道
Do you have any idea how hard it was

260
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,572
我墜天的時候有多難 我不僅僅是丟了榮光
When I fell to earth,I didn't just lose my powers

261
00:12:16,572 --> 00:12:17,465

我一無是處了
I am nothing

-我是懂 -能幫我們破解嗎
-But yes -Will you help us read it

283

因為那晚我也在

Sorry moose,to the last drop

289
00:13:33,832 --> 00:13:35,798
Crowley 你活下來的唯一原因
Crowley,the only reason you're alive

290
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,186
是因為我哥覺得你有用
Is my brother thought you'd be useful

291
00:13:39,374 --> 00:13:40,947
目前為止 你什麼用都沒有
So far you've done Jack

292
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:45,499
看來我們要考慮備用計劃了
Back to Plan B I guess

293
00:13:46,682 --> 00:13:47,561
什麼備用計劃
Which is

294
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,468
把你送給Abaddon
Give you up to Abaddon

295
00:13:50,422 --> 00:13:52,658
你以為用那個小賤人就能威脅到我
You think you can threaten me with that hack

296
00:13:54,035 --> 00:13:56,687
她被憤怒沖暈了頭 沒有一點兒用處
She's all fury,no finesse

297
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,357
我還真不確定
I'm not so sure

298
00:13:59,497 --> 00:14:01,953
上次我們見她的時候 她
Our last encounter with Abaddon,she was

299
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,170
她挺嚇人的
She's pretty terrifying

300
00:14:05,484 --> 00:14:07,342
比你嚇人多了
Scarier than you've been in years

301
00:14:08,474 --> 00:14:09,767
紙給我
Bring that to me

302
00:14:35,312 --> 00:14:36,476
這不是你
This is not you,man

303
00:14:36,477 --> 00:14:38,554
你可是個天使啊 別鬧了
You're above this.Come on

304
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:41,796
不 Dean 我不是
No,Dean.I'm not

305
00:14:42,752 --> 00:14:44,957
我沒能做好一個天使
I failed to be an angel

306
00:14:45,556 --> 00:14:48,040
我想做好事 但每次結局都不對
Everything I ever attempted came out wrong

307
00:14:48,991 --> 00:14:50,000
在這兒
But here

308
00:14:50,786 --> 00:14:53,096
至少我還有做對的機會
At least I have a shot to getting things right

309
00:14:53,898 --> 00:14:55,464
我猜你可能看不到 但是
I guess you can't see it,but

310
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,933
我的工作中有尊嚴存在
There's a real dignity in what I do

311
00:14:57,933 --> 00:14:59,393
人類的尊嚴
A human dignity

312
00:14:59,393 --> 00:15:01,331
我不想打擾你們 但是有個顧客
Hate to interrupt you guys,but a customer

313
00:15:01,332 --> 00:15:02,855
在男廁裏出了點兒小問題
Had an accident in the men's room

314
00:15:03,993 --> 00:15:04,827
我就去
I'm on it

315
00:15:04,827 --> 00:15:06,232
哦對了 今晚
Oh,and tonight

316
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,042
你7點過來 沒問題吧
7 at my place work for you

317
00:15:08,935 --> 00:15:09,756
沒問題
Great

318
00:15:10,985 --> 00:15:12,127
你真好
You're the best

319
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,522
這才是真正原因
That's what this is about

320
00:15:17,446 --> 00:15:18,319
什麼
What

321
00:15:19,391 --> 00:15:21,494
-那個姑娘 -不是的 Dean 
-The girl -No,Dean 

322
00:15:21,494 --> 00:15:22,533
不是
It's not

323
00:15:23,452 --> 00:15:24,440
Nora
Nora

324
00:15:25,785 --> 00:15:27,347
她人很好
She's a very nice woman

325
00:15:27,587 --> 00:15:30,133
我非常確定 她不想取我性命
I'm pretty she's not a reaper intend on killing me

326
00:15:30,877 --> 00:15:32,396
她還約我出去
And she's asked me out

327
00:15:33,121 --> 00:15:35,234
人類是會去約會的 對吧
Going on dates,something humans do,right

328
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:37,599
我一般碰不上單身就不約會
My dates usually end when I run out of singles

329
00:15:37,599 --> 00:15:39,477
對 對 我們都是
But,yeah,yeah,that's something

330
00:15:39,478 --> 00:15:40,534
會 去 約會的
That...humans...do

331
00:15:44,983 --> 00:15:46,248
我是Lee Ermey探員
This is Agent Lee Ermey

332
00:15:48,776 --> 00:15:49,890
我馬上就過去
I'll be right there

333
00:15:50,571 --> 00:15:52,500
又一起兇殺案 在一所高中裏
This is another kill,over at the high school

334
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,102
你來嗎
You coming

335
00:15:53,104 --> 00:15:55,314
我都沒有榮光了 去了有什麼用
I won't be much use,I don't have my powers

336
00:15:55,514 --> 00:15:56,924
所以呢 我從來都沒有過
So?I've never had powers

337
00:15:57,239 --> 00:15:58,549
你是獵人
You are a hunter

338
00:15:58,549 --> 00:16:00,705
你是獵人學徒 記得嗎
And you're a hunter-in-training,remember

339
00:16:01,453 --> 00:16:02,367
是 我記得
Yeah,I remember

340
00:16:02,368 --> 00:16:04,433
-你說我很差勁 -我沒說過
-You said I sucked -I didn't say that

341
00:16:04,599 --> 00:16:05,829
我只是說
I said there was a

342
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:08,053
有進步的空間 來吧
You know,a room for improvement.Come on

343
00:16:09,952 --> 00:16:11,912
好吧 我還有5分鐘下班 
All right.My shift's over in 5 minutes 

344
00:16:11,913 --> 00:16:14,138
-約會是在晚些時候 -這就對了
-My date's not until later -Attaboy

345
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:14,959
我去開車
I'll go to get the car

346
00:16:15,023 --> 00:16:16,223
別急
Not just yet

347
00:16:17,723 --> 00:16:19,543
我先把衛生間清理了
I have to clean the bathroom

348
00:16:51,752 --> 00:16:53,826
我們本來在說話
One second,we're talking

349
00:16:53,826 --> 00:16:55,891
然後她突然
And the next,she just

350
00:16:56,085 --> 00:16:58,105
沒有動靜了 之後
Stops and then

351
00:16:58,105 --> 00:17:00,716
整個食堂裏的人都嚇呆了
Everyone in the cafeteria,freaks

352
00:17:00,716 --> 00:17:03,498
大家衝到窗戶前 指著窗外
Rushing and pointing out window at

353
00:17:08,096 --> 00:17:09,936
天啊 真的是她嗎
God,could that really be her

354
00:17:11,835 --> 00:17:13,999
沒有人看到其他陌生人出現嗎
And nobody saw anybody else at the scene

355
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,729
不管是男的還是女的 沒有不尋常的地方嗎
A man or a woman...anything unusual

356
00:17:18,629 --> 00:17:20,660
你的朋友 有抑鬱的跡像嗎
Your friend,was she...depressed

357
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,667
-什麼意思 -有自殺傾向嗎
-Depressed? -Any thoughts of suicide

358
00:17:25,942 --> 00:17:26,748
沒有
No

359
00:17:27,836 --> 00:17:31,824
她可能有有些不高興
I mean she's kind of bummed that dick bag Travis

360
00:17:31,824 --> 00:17:34,090
她的混蛋前男友當著全校的面甩了他
Broke up with her in front of whole school

361
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,228
-有些不高興 -對
-Kind of bummed -Yeah

362
00:17:36,366 --> 00:17:40,850
比她考試拿C要不高興得多
Like more bummed than she got a C on a quiz and

363
00:17:41,664 --> 00:17:43,907
但沒有她父母離婚時那麼沮喪
Less bummed than when her parents split up

364
00:17:43,908 --> 00:17:45,588
就是 不高興
Kinda...bummed

365
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,165
失陪
Excuse me

366
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,728
Cass 怎麼了
Cass?What's wrong

367
00:18:08,392 --> 00:18:09,778
我以前見過
I've seen this before

368
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:11,637
什麼 在哪兒見過
What?Where

369
00:18:11,866 --> 00:18:12,952
在天堂
In heaven

370
00:18:13,472 --> 00:18:14,880
什麼意思 是天使干的嗎
What,you're saying an angel did this

371
00:18:15,793 --> 00:18:17,632
不是普通天使
It's no ordinary angel

372
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:20,527
Dean 這次太糟了
Dean,this is bad

373
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,228
非常嚴重
This is very bad

374
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:34,795
在天堂裏
On the battlefields...of heaven

375
00:18:34,795 --> 00:18:36,598
有一級特殊的天使
There was a special class of angel

376
00:18:37,105 --> 00:18:38,649
叫Rit Zien
The Rit Zien

377
00:18:39,394 --> 00:18:41,237
天使語中的救濟天使
Enochian for hands of mercy

378
00:18:41,813 --> 00:18:43,808
他們就像醫護人員 上戰場
They function like medics.They tended to the wounded

379
00:18:43,808 --> 00:18:45,894
去救受傷的天使 特別是很難好的傷 但是
They healed those who couldn't be healed,but

380
00:18:45,894 --> 00:18:48,256
對於那種救不回來的重大創傷
For the mortally wounded those who were

381
00:18:48,499 --> 00:18:51,288
Rit Zien的任務就是毀滅
Past saving,the rit zien's job was to put them down

382
00:18:51,488 --> 00:18:52,829
就是炸成碎片嗎
But the granulated bodies

383
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:55,476
這是他們的特殊能力
This was their...special ability

384
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:57,883
他們這種毀滅的能力
They had this way of smiting that was so

385
00:18:57,883 --> 00:18:59,926
很快 很徹底
Quick and so total that it rendered

386
00:18:59,926 --> 00:19:01,582
甚至都不會有疼痛感
Death virtually painless

387
00:19:01,635 --> 00:19:03,291
但是他們下手的對象不是受傷的天使
But these aren't wounded angels

388
00:19:03,292 --> 00:19:04,947
他們都是普通人類
That they are vaporizing.They are people

389
00:19:04,947 --> 00:19:05,947
你說得對
Right

390
00:19:07,093 --> 00:19:08,250
我也不知道
I don't know

391
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:11,990
Rit Zien尾隨痛苦而來
The Rit Zien home in on pain

392
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,182
痛苦就像是他們的燈塔
It's like a beacon to them

393
00:19:13,471 --> 00:19:15,801
所以 當此天使墜天以後
So,when this angel fell to earth

394
00:19:15,999 --> 00:19:18,829
他肯定聽到了受害人的痛苦
He heard the victim's cries,their anguish

395
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,040
就像在天堂能聽到天使的痛苦一樣
Same to hear the angel in heaven

396
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:25,048
他在人間繼續曾經在天堂的工作
He's continuing his heavenly work down here

397
00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:26,890
每次一個受難的凡人
One suffering human at a time

398
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:28,778
嗯 但是這個女孩兒沒有受苦受難
Yeah,but this last victim was not suffering

399
00:19:28,779 --> 00:19:30,289
就只是一個衝動的孩子而已
Just a normal moody kid

400
00:19:30,588 --> 00:19:31,738
但是他剛才來過了
But he just got here

401
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:34,232
人類情緒的變幻莫測
The ebb and float human emotion

402
00:19:35,155 --> 00:19:38,215
Dean 我也來凡間好幾年了
Dean...I've been on earth for a few years

403
00:19:38,686 --> 00:19:40,888
我才剛剛能理解 對他來說
And I've only begun to grasp,to him

404
00:19:41,824 --> 00:19:42,789
痛苦不會消失
Pain is pain

405
00:19:43,745 --> 00:19:44,810
那麼所有人都有可能是下一個受害者了
So everybody is fair game

406
00:19:47,077 --> 00:19:48,523
真好 我們得阻止他
All right,well,we got to stop him

407
00:19:50,266 --> 00:19:51,394
你要阻止他
You have to stop him

408
00:19:56,307 --> 00:19:56,882
你害怕了
You're scared

409
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,608
現在不一樣了 Dean
It's different now,Dean

410
00:20:00,182 --> 00:20:01,410
一切都不一樣了
Everything feels different

411
00:20:05,107 --> 00:20:05,658
說得對
You're right

412
00:20:06,801 --> 00:20:08,185
好吧 那我去追這位
All right,I'll track down this

413
00:20:08,878 --> 00:20:10,662
變態醫生 再幹掉他
Kevorkian wanna be,and I'll put him down

414
00:20:13,149 --> 00:20:13,787
好
Okay

415
00:20:14,398 --> 00:20:15,406
你別惹麻煩
You stay safe

416
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:17,401
去約會
Go on that date,all right

417
00:20:17,401 --> 00:20:18,815
過正常人的日子
G live a normal life

418
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:21,998
好
Okay

419
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:30,806
還有事嗎
Well

420
00:20:33,926 --> 00:20:34,798
我需要你載我一程
I need a ride

421
00:20:37,243 --> 00:20:37,745
好吧
Right

422
00:20:49,046 --> 00:20:49,728
我答應你
I'll do it

423
00:20:51,147 --> 00:20:53,243
但是不是無償的
But I want something in return

424
00:20:53,387 --> 00:20:56,128
-你要什麼 -打一通電話
-What's that -A telephone call

425
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,425
別這樣 麋鹿
Come on,moose

426
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:05,461
就算是Dahmer也有打電話的權利
Even Dahmer got one telephone call
注 Jeffery Dahmer是美國20世紀時一位連環殺人案件真兇

427
00:21:06,844 --> 00:21:07,345
你真想
Seriously

428
00:21:07,345 --> 00:21:09,770
讓他給Abaddon打電話嗎
You wanna let Crowley communicate with Abaddon

429
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:12,620
一個地獄之王加上企圖篡權的地獄騎士
A king and a power-mad knight of hell isn't enough

430
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,782
你還嫌不夠亂 想組個混種惡魔軍團是嗎
You wanna throw a demonic team up into mix

431
00:21:15,495 --> 00:21:16,191
我不這麼想
I don't think so

432
00:21:16,236 --> 00:21:18,374
我是說 我也不相信Crowley 但是
I mean...I don't trust Crowley either,but

433
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,985
說實話 我覺得他不會和Abaddon合作
I can't honestly see him working with Abaddon

434
00:21:20,985 --> 00:21:22,306
他恨死她了
He hates her too much

435
00:21:22,579 --> 00:21:23,282
你自己說的
You said it

436
00:21:23,899 --> 00:21:24,663
你不相信他
You can't trust him

437
00:21:24,781 --> 00:21:25,705
我們不一定要相信
We don't have to

438
00:21:25,981 --> 00:21:27,106
Crowley已經被困住了
Look,Crowley's bound

439
00:21:27,628 --> 00:21:29,205
我們可以隨時掛電話
We can end the call whenever we want

440
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:31,221
就算他想給Abaddon洩露什麼消息
Even if he wanted to give Abaddon information

441
00:21:31,878 --> 00:21:32,649
他也沒什麼好透露的
He has nothing to give her

442
00:21:32,649 --> 00:21:33,965
他連基地的位置都不知道
He don't even know where the bunker is

443
00:21:35,008 --> 00:21:36,887
他說他能破解那些文字
He says he can decrypt the translation

444
00:21:38,876 --> 00:21:39,784
他要是撒謊怎麼辦
What if he's lying

445
00:21:42,616 --> 00:21:43,041
這倒是
You're right

446
00:21:45,247 --> 00:21:46,230
我們需要證據
We'll need proof

447
00:21:47,956 --> 00:21:48,606
這些怎麼解
What are these

448
00:21:51,181 --> 00:21:53,167
-材料 -什麼材料
-Ingredients -More specific

449
00:21:54,095 --> 00:21:57,111
一個 咒語的材料
Ingredients...for a spell

450
00:22:04,809 --> 00:22:06,946
拿非利人的心 丘比特的弓
Heart of a Nephilim,Cupid's bow

451
00:22:07,358 --> 00:22:08,310
天使的榮光
Grace of an angel

452
00:22:11,277 --> 00:22:12,212
剩下的呢
And the rest of them

453
00:22:14,215 --> 00:22:15,339
電話
Phone call

454
00:22:16,795 --> 00:22:18,826
等我打了電話 就告訴你們剩下的
You'll get the rest,when I get paid

455
00:22:21,885 --> 00:22:24,012
現在 你們誰願意
Now,who's gonna be a dear

456
00:22:24,226 --> 00:22:25,201
把電話給我啊
And open up a vein

457
00:22:33,788 --> 00:22:34,267
到了
Okay

00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,215
謝謝你 Dean
Thanks Dean

459
00:22:39,085 --> 00:22:40,622
Cass 等一下
Cass,wait

460
00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:45,452
我不能就這麼讓你進去
I can't let you do this

461
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:46,821
什麼
What

462
00:22:48,337 --> 00:22:49,162
你就穿這個
You're gonna wear that

463
00:22:49,643 --> 00:22:50,257
去約會嗎
On a date

464
00:22:52,022 --> 00:22:53,447
我只有這一身
This is all I have,Dean

465
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:54,387
好吧
Okay

466
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,122
馬甲脫了
Lose the vest

467
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,946
-為什麼要 -脫馬甲 快
-What do you -Lose the vest,come on

468
00:23:00,975 --> 00:23:02,552
這樣稍微好一點兒了
That's a little better.All right

469
00:23:04,927 --> 00:23:06,403
這樣才對
There we go.All right

470
00:23:06,494 --> 00:23:07,004
解扣子
And now your button

471
00:23:07,004 --> 00:23:08,236
解開幾個口子
Why don't you unbutton it

472
00:23:09,553 --> 00:23:10,036
好
Okay

473
00:23:10,165 --> 00:23:11,328
等等等 夠了夠了
That's...that's far enough

474
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:12,264
Tony Manero
Tony Manero
注 Tony Manero是歌舞片週末夜狂熱中的男主角

475
00:23:16,192 --> 00:23:18,199
好了 你看起來不錯
Yeah,good,all right

476
00:23:18,902 --> 00:23:21,603
聽我說 一定要你給她開門
Listen to me,always open the door for her,okay

477
00:23:21,864 --> 00:23:23,164
一定要問好多問題
Ask a lot of questions

478
00:23:23,837 --> 00:23:24,421
女人們就喜歡這個
They like that

479
00:23:24,847 --> 00:23:27,485
如果她說她想去荷蘭
And if she says she's happy to go Dutch

480
00:23:28,727 --> 00:23:29,307
她一定在撒謊
She's lying

481
00:23:30,357 --> 00:23:30,749
好了
All right

482
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:33,426
去吧 帥哥
Go and get her,tiger

483
00:24:17,462 --> 00:24:18,510
不錯嘛
Nice touch

484
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:31,120
你怎麼倒車呢 混蛋
What are you doing,jackass

485
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:34,872
喂
Hey

486
00:24:51,718 --> 00:24:53,870
Steve 你能來真是太好了
Steve,I'm so glad you're here

487
00:24:54,362 --> 00:24:54,753
進來吧
Come in

488
00:24:58,731 --> 00:24:59,742
我以為我會趕不上呢
I thought I was gonna be late

489
00:25:00,295 --> 00:25:02,136
-趕不上什麼 -我的約會
-Late for what -My date

490
00:25:02,724 --> 00:25:04,376
我要去打保齡球 太難以置信了吧
Bowling,would you believe it

491
00:25:05,585 --> 00:25:07,162
不過就算是去打保齡球
But,damn if I'm not dressing fancy

492
00:25:07,438 --> 00:25:08,398
我也要盛裝
Even for bowling

493
00:25:08,903 --> 00:25:11,247
自從Tanya出生以來 我都一直沒機會穿
Haven't had an excuse to doll up since Tanya was born

494
00:25:12,254 --> 00:25:14,532
來看看我的小天使 
There she is,my little angel

495
00:25:15,123 --> 00:25:16,316
我已經餵過她了
Now she's already been fed

496
00:25:16,523 --> 00:25:18,280
我估計她會一直睡下去
She'll probably sleep the whole time

497
00:25:18,305 --> 00:25:19,968
反正我只出去幾個小時
And I'll only be gone for a couple of hours

498
00:25:20,481 --> 00:25:22,430
我平時用的保姆過不來
I just couldn't get my usual sitter and

499
00:25:22,661 --> 00:25:23,983
萬一她醒過來哭泣的話
I need somebody here in case 

500
00:25:23,983 --> 00:25:25,360
我需要有人在家看著她
She wakes up and starts crying

501
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:27,438
不過我保證她不會的
Which she won't,I promise

502
00:25:27,754 --> 00:25:29,039
Tanya從來不哭
Baby Tanya never cries

503
00:25:29,729 --> 00:25:30,470
祝我好運吧
Wish me luck

504
00:25:35,157 --> 00:25:37,558
還有謝謝你 你真是個好人
And thank you,you really are the best

505
00:25:48,682 --> 00:25:49,604
看孩子啊
Babysitting

506
00:26:00,146 --> 00:26:00,816
不行 不行
A-bup-bup

507
00:26:01,922 --> 00:26:02,710
怎麼了
What

508
00:26:02,912 --> 00:26:05,330
不要你的 要他的
Not yours,his

509
00:26:06,722 --> 00:26:08,147
這有什麼區別嗎
What difference does it make

510
00:26:08,322 --> 00:26:09,691
我用過你的了
I've had yours

511
00:26:10,049 --> 00:26:11,389
我都已經被困在這兒了
Stuck in here

512
00:26:11,916 --> 00:26:14,113
在飲食上要求點兒花樣不算過分吧
Can't fault me for wanting a little variety

513
00:26:14,113 --> 00:26:15,120
不可能
No way

514
00:26:15,474 --> 00:26:16,819
怎麼了 小朋友
What's wrong,short round

515
00:26:17,462 --> 00:26:18,639
難道你害怕針頭嗎
Afraid of needles

516
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:22,642
不 只是我個人的原則是
No,I just have policy not giving blood

517
00:26:22,642 --> 00:26:24,378
不給殺了我母親的人提供血液
To anyone who's murdered my mother

518
00:26:25,516 --> 00:26:28,815
我有的是時間
I have nothing but time

519
00:26:30,115 --> 00:26:31,169
你個混蛋
You're a dick

520
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:34,821
祝你們翻譯順利
Good luck with that translation

521
00:27:09,635 --> 00:27:14,511
咒語
Spells

522
00:27:16,349 --> 00:27:17,830
我是Crowley
This is Crowley

523
00:27:17,925 --> 00:27:21,229
幫我接 是Crowley
Connect me to...Crowley
信號不大好
Bad connection

524
00:27:26,241 --> 00:27:28,884
Crowley 你們的王
Crowley,your king

525
00:27:31,638 --> 00:27:34,140
如果你現在不給我接Abaddon
If you don't connect me to Abaddon right away

526
00:27:34,213 --> 00:27:35,430
我就不得不
I'll be forced to 

527
00:27:37,184 --> 00:27:38,306
怎麼了 發生什麼了
What,what happened

528
00:27:39,792 --> 00:27:41,187
他們讓我等一下
I've been placed on hold

529
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:44,841
你好
Hello

530
00:27:47,731 --> 00:27:48,739
呃
Um

531
00:27:51,444 --> 00:27:53,688
別 別哭
Please,please don't

532
00:28:04,568 --> 00:28:08,667
好吧 好吧 
Okay,okay,

533
00:28:08,667 --> 00:28:11,251
我給你唱個搖籃曲吧
How about a lullaby

534
00:28:13,838 --> 00:28:15,530
好了 噓 噓
Okay,shh,shh

535
00:28:15,765 --> 00:28:18,727
看看我身上都發生了什麼
Look at what's happening to me

536
00:28:19,797 --> 00:28:23,036
連我自己都不敢相信
I can't believe it myself

537
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:27,943
忽然之間我坐在雲端
Suddenly I'm on top of the world

538
00:28:29,435 --> 00:28:32,620
忽然之間又變成了普通人
Suddenly I'm somebody else

539
00:28:34,026 --> 00:28:36,604
哦 不管你信不信
Oh,believe it or not

540
00:28:36,604 --> 00:28:39,208
我現在感覺很開心
I'm walking on air

541
00:28:39,262 --> 00:28:42,715
我從沒想過自己會如此自由
I never thought I would be so free

542
00:28:44,052 --> 00:28:48,395
支起翅膀飛向遠方 一路歌唱
Flying away on a wing and a prayer

543
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:51,423
哦 那人會是誰
Oh,who could it be

544
00:28:51,911 --> 00:28:53,514
不管你信不信
Believe it or not

545
00:28:53,514 --> 00:28:55,131
這就是我
It's just me

546
00:28:56,718 --> 00:28:58,476
不管你信不信
Believe it or not

547
00:28:58,476 --> 00:29:00,882
這就是我
It's just me
我就知道
I know,I know

548
00:29:12,994 --> 00:29:13,433
探長
Sheriff

549
00:29:13,896 --> 00:29:14,704
有個好消息
Here's a wrinkle

550
00:29:15,054 --> 00:29:17,103
第一個犯罪現場 那對夫婦的死亡現場
Our first crime scene,married couple

551
00:29:17,475 --> 00:29:20,075
我們剛從實驗室那邊獲得了化驗結果
Full analysis of the spray just came from the lab

552
00:29:20,488 --> 00:29:23,081
現場只有那妻子的DNA
Turns out it only contains the wife's DNA

553
00:29:24,591 --> 00:29:25,808
那就是說那丈夫還活著
The husband's still out there

554
00:29:28,216 --> 00:29:29,736
沒人告訴過你
Nobody told you

555
00:29:29,936 --> 00:29:31,728
也沒人解釋過
Nobody explained

556
00:29:32,657 --> 00:29:36,863
你就這麼
You just shoved out

557
00:29:37,465 --> 00:29:40,944
連哭帶喊的誕生在這世界裏
Kicking and screaming into this human life without

558
00:29:41,627 --> 00:29:45,064
也不知道為什麼你會感覺到你所感覺的一切
Any idea why any of you feels the way you feel

559
00:29:45,901 --> 00:29:47,645
也不知道為什麼會有那麼多困惑
Or why this confusion

560
00:29:48,755 --> 00:29:51,229
感覺就像是
It just feels like it's a hair's breadth from

561
00:29:52,277 --> 00:29:54,212
恐懼 或者痛苦
Terror,or pain

562
00:29:56,616 --> 00:29:58,495
就當你以為你明白一切了的時候
You know,just when you think you do understand

563
00:29:58,495 --> 00:29:59,694
結果發現你還是什麼都不懂
It'll turned out you were wrong

564
00:30:01,144 --> 00:30:02,832
你什麼也不明白
You didn't understand anything at all

565
00:30:03,186 --> 00:30:05,390
事實就是這樣的
This is just how it is when you're new at this

566
00:30:07,703 --> 00:30:10,051
其實就在不久之前
You know,it wasn't that long ago

567
00:30:10,051 --> 00:30:11,905
我只要輕觸一下你的額頭
All I need to do to ease your pain is

568
00:30:12,073 --> 00:30:13,313
就會解除你的痛苦
Is touch you

569
00:30:17,127 --> 00:30:18,750
你的溫度有點高啊
You're very warm

570
00:30:19,603 --> 00:30:20,850
這正常嗎
Is that normal

571
00:30:24,715 --> 00:30:26,246
噓 噓
Shh,shh

572
00:30:26,843 --> 00:30:28,379
他差點兒就精神失常了
He's already a bit screwy 

573
00:30:28,379 --> 00:30:29,594
但他又找到了信仰
But then he found religion

574
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:33,249
她是個絕對的無神論者
She was a hard line atheist no peach herself

575
00:30:33,249 --> 00:30:36,503
當他對那個愚蠢的Boyle牧師表現出極大的興趣後
When he got himself obsessed with this Buddy Boyle wackjob

576
00:30:36,936 --> 00:30:38,554
本來就很糟的婚姻變得愈發不可收拾
An already bad marriage got worse

577
00:30:38,554 --> 00:30:40,497
不斷告誡她要相信上帝的存在
Kept telling her to let God in

578
00:30:40,497 --> 00:30:42,361
牧師Boyle 這就解釋的通了
Buddy Boyle,that explains it

579
00:30:42,562 --> 00:30:43,561
解釋了什麼
Explains what

580
00:30:44,751 --> 00:30:45,663
沒什麼
Never mind

581
00:30:50,452 --> 00:30:51,059
這是他的車嗎
Was that his truck

582
00:30:51,505 --> 00:30:52,312
對
Yeah

583
00:30:55,809 --> 00:30:56,744
Cass
Cass

584
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:58,268
Nora 她發燒了
Nora,she's really hot

585
00:31:00,331 --> 00:31:02,538
請給我回電話
Please just call,call back

586
00:31:02,538 --> 00:31:03,675
如果你不回電話
If I don't hear back

587
00:31:03,876 --> 00:31:05,437
我就帶她去醫院了
I'm taking her to the hospital

588
00:31:20,134 --> 00:31:22,320
好吧 Tanya 我們出去走走
Okay,Tanya,we're taking a little walk

589
00:31:30,566 --> 00:31:31,709
你好 Castiel
Hello,Castiel

590
00:31:40,836 --> 00:31:42,592
可悲的小傻瓜
Squalid little dump

591
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:44,081
怪不得她要哭啊
No wonder she cries

592
00:31:44,081 --> 00:31:47,555
她發燒了而已 Ephraim 她會好的
It's a fever,Ephraim.It'll pass

593
00:31:48,286 --> 00:31:49,790
你記得我的名字呢
You remember my name

594
00:31:50,453 --> 00:31:52,382
我們見面的時候 我還什麼都不是呢
I was just nobody when we met

595
00:31:52,829 --> 00:31:55,403
但是你那時候已經是個傳奇人物了
But you,you were a legend

596
00:31:56,886 --> 00:31:58,111
你以前就來過這裏
You've been here before

597
00:31:58,136 --> 00:31:59,648
我是頭一次來人類的世界
This is my first time

598
00:31:59,648 --> 00:32:00,397
它很
And it's

599
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:02,307
很令人緊張
It's intense

600
00:32:02,781 --> 00:32:03,620
一開始對人性
You know there is a lot you don't 

601
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,469
你肯定有很多不明白的地方
Understand about humanity at first

602
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:08,035
如果你能停下來
If you just stop

603
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:08,907
停下
Stop

604
00:32:10,402 --> 00:32:11,849
我不會停下的
I won't stop 

605
00:32:12,757 --> 00:32:15,864
直到我把這個星球上所有的痛苦清除乾淨
Until I wash the planet clean of all suffering

606
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:20,541
讓我來吧
Allow me

607
00:32:22,189 --> 00:32:24,765
別碰她
Don't touch her

608
00:32:25,943 --> 00:32:27,266
你以為我是為她而來的
You think I came for her

609
00:32:28,823 --> 00:32:30,007
不 Castiel
No,Castiel

610
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:32,174
我為你而來
I came for you

611
00:32:37,525 --> 00:32:39,957
接通惡魔電話需要多久
How long will it take to transfer demonic phone call

612
00:32:39,957 --> 00:32:41,502
別吵 鹿鹿
Can it,moose

613
00:32:43,423 --> 00:32:44,731
Crowley 你也打了電話了
Crowley,you got your call

614
00:32:44,731 --> 00:32:46,260
是啊 是時候了
Yeah,It's time

615
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,585
我說是時候了的時候 才是時候了
It's time when I bloody well say it's time 

616
00:32:48,585 --> 00:32:50,953
你好 Abadon
Hello Abadon

617
00:32:50,953 --> 00:32:51,946
Crowley
Crowley

618
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,962
你最近還好嗎
How in the hell are you

619
00:32:58,085 --> 00:33:00,231
這麼多的痛苦和絕望
So much pain and despair

620
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:03,039
這麼多聲音
So many voices

621
00:33:03,423 --> 00:33:04,942
乞求著解脫
Begging out for relief

622
00:33:04,942 --> 00:33:06,033
你是怎麼找到我的
How did you find me

623
00:33:07,869 --> 00:33:09,208
因為你避開天使了嗎
Because you are warded

624
00:33:10,253 --> 00:33:12,690
和我找到其他病人的方法一樣
The same way I found all my patients

625
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,342
我只是跟著你痛苦的聲音
I just followed the sound of your pain

626
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:19,094
你不知道那有多大聲
You have no idea how loud it is

627
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:22,030
我在幾里之外就能聽到
I can hear you from miles

628
00:33:22,958 --> 00:33:23,999
你真的以為
You really you think 

629
00:33:23,999 --> 00:33:25,450
你在這裏做天堂的工作嗎
You are doing heaven's work down here

630
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:26,726
我知道我是的
I know I am

631
00:33:26,977 --> 00:33:28,097
你錯了
Well,you are wrong

632
00:33:28,825 --> 00:33:30,661
地球有時是個很難生存的地方
Earth can be a hard place

633
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,972
這些人類 他們可以變得更好
These humans,they can get better

634
00:33:33,972 --> 00:33:36,026
他們只是在盡力而為
They are just doing the best they can

635
00:33:36,026 --> 00:33:38,366
這就是你認為你在做的事嗎 Castiel
Is that what you think you are doing,Castiel

636
00:33:38,366 --> 00:33:40,063
盡力而為
The best you can

637
00:33:40,925 --> 00:33:42,022
很抱歉
Well,I'm sorry

638
00:33:42,171 --> 00:33:45,227
但如果這就是著名的Castiel的盡力而為
But if this is the best of the famed Castiel can do

639
00:33:45,227 --> 00:33:47,602
你的處境比我想像的還要狼狽
You are a more urgent case than I thought

640
00:33:47,602 --> 00:33:49,297
我曾經崇拜你
I used to admire you

641
00:33:50,004 --> 00:33:52,582
你失敗的的次數遠超過你成功的次數
You failed more often than you succeeded

642
00:33:53,127 --> 00:33:55,721
但至少你曾經是做大事的
But at least you played big

643
00:34:03,805 --> 00:34:05,309
而現在你在做什麼
Now what are you doing

644
00:34:06,264 --> 00:34:07,982
把頭埋在沙子裏
Burying your head in the sand

645
00:34:08,551 --> 00:34:11,473
在你的族人最需要你的時候
Right when your kind need you most

646
00:34:12,983 --> 00:34:14,270
數量怎麼樣
How are the numbers

647
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:15,836
你是說靈魂數量嗎
You mean souls

648
00:34:16,307 --> 00:34:18,694
比你預想的要多一倍
I've managed a double on your projections

649
00:34:19,065 --> 00:34:22,840
我是怎麼能  成功的
Now,how did I ever pull off such a feat

650
00:34:23,082 --> 00:34:25,675
你在提前收取靈魂
You are taking souls before their time

651
00:34:27,478 --> 00:34:29,476
取消我的契約
Voiding my contracts

652
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,726
是的
That's right

653
00:34:30,726 --> 00:34:32,405
我正在把它們銷毀掉
I'm taking it all down

654
00:34:32,941 --> 00:34:34,742
一點一點
Brick by brick

655
00:34:34,742 --> 00:34:35,995
已經結束了
It's over

656
00:34:35,995 --> 00:34:39,285
Crowley 官僚主義之王 的日子
The days of Crowley,the king of bureaucrat

657
00:34:39,475 --> 00:34:40,743
已經結束了
Are done

658
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,698
馬上就好了
It'll be over soon

659
00:34:45,927 --> 00:34:46,883
我會把疼痛帶走
I'll take the pain away

660
00:34:46,883 --> 00:34:48,951
我想活著
I want to live

661
00:34:48,951 --> 00:34:50,304
但是以什麼身份呢 Castiel
But as what,Castiel

662
00:34:50,725 --> 00:34:51,967
作為天使
As an angel

663
00:34:52,894 --> 00:34:54,023
還是人類
Or a man

664
00:35:01,883 --> 00:35:02,984
你這個
You

665
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,302
骯髒
Ganky

666
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:06,032
噁心的
Putrescent

667
00:35:06,032 --> 00:35:07,398
婊子
Skanger

668
00:35:07,398 --> 00:35:09,206
我的效率在你看來可能不值一提
It may look like bean-counting to you

669
00:35:09,206 --> 00:35:11,141
可能缺少技巧
May lack a certain adolescent flair

670
00:35:11,141 --> 00:35:13,778
但我的方法奏效
But my way works

671
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:18,600
你以為你能控制地獄
You think you can control hell

672
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,017
就以這麼混亂的方式
With chaos alone

673
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:22,699
不用支持 來自
Without the the support of those 

674
00:35:22,699 --> 00:35:24,393
依然忠於我的人
Who are still loyal to me

675
00:35:24,393 --> 00:35:25,992
已經有一周沒人看見你了
No one's seen you in weeks

676
00:35:25,992 --> 00:35:27,295
我最後一次見你的時候
And the last I saw you,Howdy and Doody had you

677
00:35:27,295 --> 00:35:30,565
你正被兩兄弟好好地綁著
Tied up nice and tight

678
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:34,210
好像 把你變成哈巴狗了
Seems to reason,they've turned you into a kennel dog

679
00:35:36,237 --> 00:35:37,618
感覺怎麼樣啊 Crowley
How does it feel Crowley

680
00:35:38,003 --> 00:35:39,671
當了Winchester的婊子
To be the Winchesters' bitch

681
00:35:40,041 --> 00:35:42,762
聽著你在這兒虛張聲勢 還真是有趣
It's been fun indulging in your bluffs

682
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:47,377
但是你我都知道 你已經沒有權威了
But we both know you have no real authority left

683
00:35:47,377 --> 00:35:48,353
也沒有籌碼
No leverage

684
00:35:48,353 --> 00:35:50,225
你沒什麼能提供給我的
You have nothing to offer me

685
00:35:50,812 --> 00:35:52,731
你一無所有
You have nothing

686
00:35:53,043 --> 00:35:54,155
你的方法
Your way

687
00:35:54,524 --> 00:35:55,690
遲早會遭到反噬
Will backfire

688
00:35:57,888 --> 00:36:01,061
等死吧
You will burn

689
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:04,452
我等不及了
I can't wait

690
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:18,909
Crowley
Crowley

691
00:36:19,755 --> 00:36:21,304
把埃蘭文給我
Give me the translations

692
00:36:24,986 --> 00:36:26,896
我履行我的合約
I keep my agreements

693
00:36:42,071 --> 00:36:43,757
取得原料
Obtain the ingrdients

694
00:36:44,384 --> 00:36:46,314
心臟 弓 榮光
Heart,bow,grace

695
00:36:46,613 --> 00:36:47,735
等等
blah blah blah

696
00:36:47,783 --> 00:36:51,223
混合 直到有煙從灰燼中升起
Mix until the smoke shall rise from the ashes

697
00:36:51,223 --> 00:36:53,617
將天使驅逐出天堂
Casting the angels from heaven

698
00:36:53,617 --> 00:36:54,913
等等
blah blah blah

699
00:36:56,167 --> 00:37:01,888
哦 不可逆轉
Oh,It's irreversible

700
00:37:03,791 --> 00:37:04,606
什麼
What

701
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,995
這個咒語無法被逆轉
The spell can't be undone

702
00:37:10,671 --> 00:37:12,109
新世界已經降臨
The new world order

703
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,978
我們只能受著了
We're stuck with it

704
00:37:18,473 --> 00:37:20,056
你說你想活著
You say you want to live

705
00:37:21,346 --> 00:37:23,143
但是我能看到 你看不到的
But you can't see what I see

706
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,128
選擇一個人類的生命
By choosing a human life

707
00:37:26,128 --> 00:37:27,650
你已經放棄了
You've already given up

708
00:37:28,681 --> 00:37:31,808
你選擇了死亡
You chose death

709
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,137
不可能
There is no way

710
00:37:52,225 --> 00:37:53,254
Crowley在撒謊
Crowley is lying

711
00:37:53,619 --> 00:37:55,497
不 Dean 這次沒有
No,Dean,not this time

712
00:37:56,182 --> 00:37:57,947
Metetron讓這個咒語經得起
Metetron built the spell to withstand 

713
00:37:57,947 --> 00:37:59,303
任何讓其逆轉的嘗試
any attempt to reverse it

714
00:37:59,622 --> 00:38:01,656
無法再把天使放回天堂了
There is no putting the angels back in heaven

715
00:38:02,122 --> 00:38:02,968
結束了
It's done

716
00:38:05,905 --> 00:38:07,418
你會告訴Cass嗎
You gonna tell Cass

717
00:38:14,485 --> 00:38:17,404
很抱歉我反應過度了
I'm sorry I overreacted

718
00:38:17,404 --> 00:38:19,438
我的朋友給了我一個小竅門
My friend gave me a tip

719
00:38:19,438 --> 00:38:22,425
少量的醋氨酚能快速退燒
A low dose of acetaminophen brought the fever right down

720
00:38:23,077 --> 00:38:23,659
沒關係
That's okay

721
00:38:24,644 --> 00:38:26,089
我的約會本來就是個災難
Date was a bust anyway

722
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,786
Steve 
Steve

723
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:36,192
你說你反應過度
The part of you that overreacted 

724
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:38,821
是因為你在意
That care so much

725
00:38:40,739 --> 00:38:42,402
正是如此 才讓你如此特別
That's what makes you special

726
00:38:56,549 --> 00:38:57,468
我得掛了
I got to go

727
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,800
準備去哪兒啊 Cass
Where to,Cass

728
00:40:11,624 --> 00:40:14,962
聽著 Cass 在基地裏
Listen Cass,back at the bunker

729
00:40:17,005 --> 00:40:19,887
我 很抱歉我把你趕走了
I...Sorry I told to go

730
00:40:22,222 --> 00:40:23,727
我知道你過得很不容易
I know it's been hard on you

731
00:40:23,728 --> 00:40:25,167
你只剩自己一個人
You know,on your own

732
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,949
但你適應了
The way you are adapting

733
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:28,919
我為你驕傲
I'm proud of you

734
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,919
謝謝你 Dean
Thank you,Dean

735
00:40:36,266 --> 00:40:40,203
但是就像Ephraim說的
But there is something Ephraim said

736
00:40:40,403 --> 00:40:43,288
天使們 他們需要幫助
The angels,they need help

737
00:40:43,361 --> 00:40:44,749
難道我真的能坐視不理
Can I really sit this out

738
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:46,971
難道我不該尋找讓他們回家的途徑嗎
Shouldn't I be searching for a way to get them home

739
00:40:47,266 --> 00:40:50,000
我和Sam會處理天使的事
Me and Sam will take care of the angels

740
00:40:51,439 --> 00:40:53,935
你現在是人類了
You are human now 

741
00:40:54,775 --> 00:40:57,104
這不再是你的問題了
It's not your problem anymore

742
00:41:34,861 --> 00:41:38,065
流星雨已經過去幾周了
It's been weeks since the massive meteor storm

743
00:41:38,066 --> 00:41:39,534
但是愛達荷州的天文學家
Yet Idaho falls astronomers still 

744
00:41:39,535 --> 00:41:41,775
還沒有給出答覆
Have unanswered questions

745
00:41:41,776 --> 00:41:44,412
華盛頓當局和航天局
NASA and Washington are both continuing 

746
00:41:44,413 --> 00:41:45,429
將繼續研究這一現象
To study the phenomenon
