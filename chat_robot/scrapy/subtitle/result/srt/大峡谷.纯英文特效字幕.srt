3
00:02:19,237 --> 00:02:22,137
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. It was just for the weekend. Private thing.

4
00:02:22,137 --> 00:02:24,947
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He knows everyone.

5
00:02:24,947 --> 00:02:26,677
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"knows."who "knows" anyone these days?

6
00:02:26,677 --> 00:02:29,577
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}More like you hang out when you're in vegas.

7
00:02:29,587 --> 00:02:31,547
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So where did you guys stay in vegas?

8
00:02:33,017 --> 00:02:35,457
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I like the four seasons,the mandalay.

9
00:02:35,457 --> 00:02:36,657
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I like the end of the strip

10
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,257
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I can watch the planes fly into mccarran.

11
00:02:39,257 --> 00:02:41,127
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, it's good to finally meet you, man.

12
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:45,527
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's good to finally, you know,meet the man in person.

13
00:02:45,527 --> 00:02:47,667
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

14
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,637
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No problem.

15
00:02:51,107 --> 00:02:53,267
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And hey, I, um,

16
00:02:53,277 --> 00:02:57,237
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I really want to thank you for giving me that role.

17
00:02:57,247 --> 00:02:58,707
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't give you that role.

18
00:02:58,707 --> 00:03:00,407
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your girlfriend and the director did.

19
00:03:00,417 --> 00:03:03,317
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, but I heard I wasn't exactly gerald's first choice.

20
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:05,347
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ryan, come on.Don't say that.

21
00:03:05,347 --> 00:03:08,017
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, he's right.You weren't.

22
00:03:08,017 --> 00:03:10,657
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I went to him and told him that I'm paying for this movie,

23
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:13,057
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So if he doesn't put my assistant's boyfriend in it,

24
00:03:13,057 --> 00:03:17,297
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then I'm pullin' out, and that's when the panic sets in.

25
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:20,167
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Panic. Panic set in?

26
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:22,597
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, it's just a low-budget slasher movie, christian.

27
00:03:22,597 --> 00:03:24,737
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think people were panicked by you.

28
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:26,737
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think, you know, they could have found the money somehow,

29
00:03:26,737 --> 00:03:29,107
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you made it easier, right?

30
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:33,947
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I have to admit, actually I was a little bit panicked.

31
00:03:35,217 --> 00:03:38,047
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fact of the matter is I'm paying for this thing.

32
00:03:38,047 --> 00:03:40,817
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I heard from both of you that he was right for the part.

33
00:03:40,817 --> 00:03:43,387
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, indirectly I had something to do with you getting the role,

34
00:03:43,387 --> 00:03:45,427
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But if it wasn't for you helping out with the casting

35
00:03:45,427 --> 00:03:47,027
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And convincing me that this guy was,

36
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:48,627
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, the best one for the role,

37
00:03:48,627 --> 00:03:52,527
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then yeah, you probably wouldn't have the part.

38
00:03:52,527 --> 00:03:56,167
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And we thank you for the favor.

39
00:03:56,167 --> 00:03:58,567
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think we all made the right decision.

40
00:04:02,037 --> 00:04:05,107
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, in the year that she worked for me,

41
00:04:05,107 --> 00:04:07,147
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She never mentioned having a boyfriend.

42
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:08,747
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is not true! I did, too!

43
00:04:08,747 --> 00:04:11,587
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You just weren't paying attention.

44
00:04:11,587 --> 00:04:12,647
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really?

45
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,357
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You guys look happy though.

46
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:19,257
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, we are.Really happy.

47
00:04:19,257 --> 00:04:21,187
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, really are.

48
00:04:26,027 --> 00:04:28,437
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you guys?

49
00:04:28,437 --> 00:04:32,567
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How long have you two been seeing each other?

50
00:04:32,567 --> 00:04:37,537
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told you, baby, a year.Just like us.

51
00:04:37,547 --> 00:04:39,247
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

52
00:04:39,247 --> 00:04:41,007
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I like to keep things loose,though.

53
00:04:41,017 --> 00:04:43,517
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, I love her.

54
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:45,417
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}God, she's gorgeous.

55
00:04:45,417 --> 00:04:49,617
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But it's more fun to keep it a little complicated.

56
00:04:49,627 --> 00:04:51,827
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Complicated?

57
00:04:51,827 --> 00:04:55,127
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Christian, what are you doing?Where are you going with this?

58
00:04:55,127 --> 00:04:56,557
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just being transparent, baby.

59
00:04:56,567 --> 00:04:58,567
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Being transparent about what?

60
00:04:58,567 --> 00:05:01,397
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know that phone app, amore?

61
00:05:01,397 --> 00:05:03,397
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's kinda like a girlfriend finder.

62
00:05:03,407 --> 00:05:05,937
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah-- I mean no.

63
00:05:05,937 --> 00:05:08,377
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wh-what does it do?

64
00:05:08,377 --> 00:05:11,237
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It makes... Things simple.

65
00:05:11,247 --> 00:05:14,307
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Certain... Assignations.

66
00:05:14,317 --> 00:05:15,717
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just really easy.

67
00:05:15,717 --> 00:05:17,417
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, you get live video,make sure that people look

68
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,787
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Exactly the way they do in their profiles.

69
00:05:19,787 --> 00:05:22,817
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Assignations for...

70
00:05:22,817 --> 00:05:24,587
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is that?

71
00:05:25,657 --> 00:05:27,657
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It means meetings, dude.

72
00:05:27,657 --> 00:05:30,697
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh! Okay.Meetings for...

73
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:31,827
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hookups.

74
00:05:31,827 --> 00:05:35,667
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, girls, coupleswhatever, man.

75
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:37,597
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Couples. Really?

76
00:05:37,607 --> 00:05:40,307
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. Couples. Really.

77
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:45,347
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess it's just, well,I don't know, I'm...

78
00:05:45,347 --> 00:05:47,777
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just a more conventional guy.

79
00:05:47,777 --> 00:05:52,317
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Which is why you're with gina,and I'm with tara.

80
00:05:52,317 --> 00:05:54,847
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you don't get jealous?

81
00:05:54,857 --> 00:05:56,787
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jealous?

82
00:05:56,787 --> 00:06:01,327
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. If there are other people involved, like guys.

83
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:05,397
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, it's mostly girls.And no, I do not get jealous

84
00:06:05,397 --> 00:06:07,767
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Watching my girl hook up with another chick.

85
00:06:09,197 --> 00:06:11,197
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is this guy--is this guy for real?

86
00:06:11,207 --> 00:06:13,867
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you for real?Is he serious?

87
00:06:13,877 --> 00:06:15,977
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, man.I mean, I--

88
00:06:15,977 --> 00:06:18,207
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, you're the man. I'm--

89
00:06:18,207 --> 00:06:20,977
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I-I was just trying to keep up with you.

90
00:06:20,977 --> 00:06:25,217
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, man, it's all about trust,all right?

91
00:06:25,217 --> 00:06:27,647
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I trust her,she trusts me.

92
00:06:27,657 --> 00:06:29,717
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe if that trust wasn't there, I couldn't handle it.

93
00:06:29,727 --> 00:06:32,787
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But since it is,we have a good time.

94
00:06:32,787 --> 00:06:34,757
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Christian,I'm sitting right here.

95
00:06:34,757 --> 00:06:36,827
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you mean,you couldn't handle it?

96
00:06:36,827 --> 00:06:39,297
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Couldn't handle what?

97
00:06:39,297 --> 00:06:43,397
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The fact that I know you love me makes me trust you.

98
00:06:43,407 --> 00:06:47,137
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That makes everything we do more intense.

99
00:06:48,507 --> 00:06:50,537
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry. Christian likes to shock people.

100
00:06:50,547 --> 00:06:51,847
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I get it.

101
00:06:51,847 --> 00:06:53,077
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or at least he tries to.

102
00:06:53,077 --> 00:06:54,807
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This has nothing to do with shocking people.

103
00:06:54,817 --> 00:06:58,587
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just sick of the old school shit about fucking propriety,

104
00:06:58,587 --> 00:06:59,787
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Etiquette and all that crap.

105
00:06:59,787 --> 00:07:01,517
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've been around me for a year.

106
00:07:01,517 --> 00:07:02,987
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just fuckin' annoying.

107
00:07:02,987 --> 00:07:04,687
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's like when you're at your family dinner on Sunday,

108
00:07:04,687 --> 00:07:06,357
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And everyone's just lying--christian, I want to go.

109
00:07:06,357 --> 00:07:08,187
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you get the fucking check?- I've ordered the check.

110
00:07:08,197 --> 00:07:09,197
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's comin'. It's on its way.

111
00:07:09,197 --> 00:07:10,497
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really?How long does it take?

112
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:12,967
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mm. It's coming though.Don't worry about it.

113
00:07:12,967 --> 00:07:14,167
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, christian,before I forget,

114
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:16,037
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm finalizing all the rooms for next month.

115
00:07:16,037 --> 00:07:18,767
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you definitely sure that you're not gonna come?

116
00:07:18,767 --> 00:07:20,567
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, there's no way I'm going to new mexico

117
00:07:20,577 --> 00:07:22,507
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And watch a bunch of kids get tortured and killed

118
00:07:22,507 --> 00:07:26,077
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}By some pissed-off ghost in a warehouse.

119
00:07:26,077 --> 00:07:29,617
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Besides, I'll be busy making my own little movies.

120
00:07:29,617 --> 00:07:31,747
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you mean,you make your own movies?

121
00:08:24,607 --> 00:08:27,337
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why in the hell did we have to go to that damn dinner?

122
00:08:27,337 --> 00:08:29,007
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gina insisted.

123
00:08:29,007 --> 00:08:32,907
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Plus I was kinda interested to see who her new dude is.

124
00:08:32,907 --> 00:08:35,217
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What a fuckin' moron.Gina's a smart girl.

125
00:08:35,217 --> 00:08:36,617
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'd think she could get with someone better

126
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:38,017
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Than some loser actor.

127
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:43,357
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you know about him?

128
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:45,357
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing.

129
00:08:45,357 --> 00:08:48,427
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I never even thought this movie would get made.

130
00:08:50,327 --> 00:08:54,027
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, gina worked very hard to make sure it happened.

131
00:08:54,037 --> 00:08:56,167
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I never even read the script.

132
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:58,397
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told gina if the mexicans or whoever came up with the cash

133
00:08:58,407 --> 00:09:00,667
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That I would just match it.

134
00:09:00,677 --> 00:09:03,007
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why aren't you involved anymore, baby?

135
00:09:03,007 --> 00:09:04,807
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why were you ever involved?

136
00:09:04,807 --> 00:09:07,747
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My father was on my ass about doing something with my life.

137
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:11,317
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When I told him I was doing a movie, he got off my back.

138
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:15,487
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are you wearing a robe?Guy's almost over here.

139
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,497
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's with all the dudes lately?

140
00:09:22,497 --> 00:09:24,697
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know.It's a phase.

141
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:26,727
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I like the idea of someone looking at something

142
00:09:26,737 --> 00:09:28,467
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They can't have.

143
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:31,067
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guy thing.Power and control.

144
00:09:31,067 --> 00:09:33,837
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But sometimes they do have me.

145
00:09:33,837 --> 00:09:37,007
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just those two times.You didn't seem to mind.

146
00:09:39,777 --> 00:09:41,877
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't believe you at dinner tonight.

147
00:09:41,877 --> 00:09:44,347
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All that shit that you were telling them.

148
00:09:44,347 --> 00:09:47,147
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that why you're being so distant and bitchy, huh?

149
00:09:47,157 --> 00:09:49,357
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why do you even fucking care?

150
00:09:49,357 --> 00:09:51,787
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just my assistant and some dumb actor.

151
00:09:51,787 --> 00:09:53,557
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. I guess I'd like to keep

152
00:09:53,557 --> 00:09:55,627
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some parts of my life private.

153
00:09:55,627 --> 00:09:59,167
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some aspects of my fucking life private.

154
00:09:59,167 --> 00:10:02,497
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nobody has a private life anymore, tara.

155
00:10:02,497 --> 00:10:06,237
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. What do you talk to your shrink about?

156
00:10:08,977 --> 00:10:12,647
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you talk about when you see dr. Campbell?

157
00:10:12,647 --> 00:10:14,447
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't tell dr. Campbell anything

158
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,947
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That I wouldn't tell you.

159
00:10:16,947 --> 00:10:19,687
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a lie. That's not true.You just lied to me.

160
00:10:19,687 --> 00:10:22,217
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What would you like to know?

161
00:10:22,217 --> 00:10:24,617
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want to know what you talk to dr. Campbell about.

162
00:10:24,627 --> 00:10:26,157
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I talk about my family.

163
00:10:26,157 --> 00:10:28,327
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I talk about my father trying to control my fucking life.

164
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:29,957
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the fuck do you think I talk to him about?

165
00:10:29,967 --> 00:10:34,397
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know.Other girls.

166
00:10:35,797 --> 00:10:40,007
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm more serious about you than I have been with any other girl.

167
00:10:42,707 --> 00:10:45,107
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hope you feel the same way about me.

168
00:10:46,347 --> 00:10:49,977
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Christian, there's a fucking guy coming over.

169
00:10:49,987 --> 00:10:51,677
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really?

170
00:10:56,517 --> 00:11:00,457
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's here.On his way down the driveway.

171
00:11:00,457 --> 00:11:04,457
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I said I hope you feel the same way about me.

172
00:11:09,337 --> 00:11:12,767
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What was with you tonight, hmm?At dinner.

173
00:11:15,737 --> 00:11:18,677
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were so tense. Hmm?

174
00:11:27,547 --> 00:11:29,557
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You let him in.

175
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:42,397
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi. Reed, right?

176
00:11:42,397 --> 00:11:44,237
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on in.

177
00:11:47,837 --> 00:11:49,577
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm tara.

178
00:11:53,507 --> 00:11:54,777
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is reed.

179
00:11:54,777 --> 00:11:57,247
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's up, man?I'm christian.

180
00:11:57,247 --> 00:11:58,717
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, man.

181
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:00,417
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I see you've met tara.

182
00:12:00,417 --> 00:12:02,217
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

183
00:12:02,217 --> 00:12:05,217
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want something to drink?Shot of tequila.

184
00:12:05,227 --> 00:12:06,587
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sure.

185
00:12:44,257 --> 00:12:46,097
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's hot, right?

186
00:12:50,397 --> 00:12:52,937
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Way hotter than the pics you sent me.

187
00:12:55,507 --> 00:12:57,107
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have a drink.

188
00:12:57,107 --> 00:12:58,677
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Relax.

189
00:13:03,947 --> 00:13:05,787
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Be comfy, man.

190
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:38,317
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wanna see something better than that.

191
00:14:08,677 --> 00:14:10,517
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How does he have all that money again?

192
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:11,977
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh, trust fund.

193
00:14:11,987 --> 00:14:15,147
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His grandparents own like half of thousand oaks.

194
00:14:17,717 --> 00:14:20,157
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's beautiful, tara, don't you think?

195
00:14:21,757 --> 00:14:23,457
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's okay.

196
00:14:26,297 --> 00:14:28,937
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't go there, babe.I'm not doing that with you.

197
00:14:28,937 --> 00:14:31,537
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Doing what?

198
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:35,577
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That whole "is that girl prettier than me?" thing you do.

199
00:14:35,577 --> 00:14:39,207
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, why are you asking me that?

200
00:14:39,207 --> 00:14:40,847
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, you never even mentioned her.

201
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:42,247
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You never told me about her for a year.

202
00:14:42,247 --> 00:14:44,117
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You didn't even mention her by name.

203
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:47,087
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was just"christian's girlfriend."

204
00:14:49,817 --> 00:14:52,527
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you really didn't tell me what a douchebag that guy is.

205
00:14:52,527 --> 00:14:53,927
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Christ!

206
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:57,497
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The reason I never mentioned her is that we never really hung out

207
00:14:57,497 --> 00:15:00,267
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Until she started helping me with the movie.

208
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:02,267
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why was she even helping you out?

209
00:15:02,267 --> 00:15:03,897
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She was bored.

210
00:15:03,907 --> 00:15:07,067
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She needed something to do besides shopping and fucking.

211
00:15:07,077 --> 00:15:09,707
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, jon and I did most of the work,

212
00:15:09,707 --> 00:15:12,477
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But she helped out a little,I guess.

213
00:15:16,447 --> 00:15:18,447
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She did push you for the part.

214
00:15:18,447 --> 00:15:20,887
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know it was probably a favor to me and christian,

215
00:15:20,887 --> 00:15:23,087
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But without her, I don't know what would've happened.

216
00:15:23,087 --> 00:15:25,887
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then after casting,she just disappeared.

217
00:15:25,887 --> 00:15:28,257
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She just stopped coming by the production office.

218
00:15:29,527 --> 00:15:32,327
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I haven't seen her in like a month.

219
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,527
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey.

220
00:16:37,527 --> 00:16:38,827
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks.

221
00:16:38,827 --> 00:16:40,827
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told you not to text me.

222
00:16:40,837 --> 00:16:42,337
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why can't I text you?

223
00:16:42,337 --> 00:16:45,337
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because he looks at my phone.

224
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,437
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why can't we meet at my place?

225
00:16:47,437 --> 00:16:49,777
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not gonna happen anymore.

226
00:16:52,507 --> 00:16:55,747
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So that's who you're with.Jesus.

227
00:16:55,747 --> 00:16:56,947
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who'd you think you were--

228
00:16:56,947 --> 00:16:58,677
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So this is the guy that gave you the mercedes

229
00:16:58,687 --> 00:17:00,487
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And has a private jet and takes you to maui

230
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:02,957
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And lives in the fucking mansion in malibu.

231
00:17:02,957 --> 00:17:04,257
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ryan, please.

232
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:06,127
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Last night killed me.

233
00:17:06,127 --> 00:17:08,187
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why?

234
00:17:08,197 --> 00:17:11,997
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because I finally saw you with him.

235
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:14,197
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know you better than he does.

236
00:17:14,197 --> 00:17:16,267
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not happy, tara.

237
00:17:16,267 --> 00:17:19,267
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who said anything about happy?

238
00:17:19,267 --> 00:17:22,067
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He takes care of me,and he's in love with me.

239
00:17:22,077 --> 00:17:23,477
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's serious.

240
00:17:23,477 --> 00:17:25,777
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck it, ryan. Who's happy? Who's really happy?

241
00:17:25,777 --> 00:17:26,947
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell me.Gina.

242
00:17:26,947 --> 00:17:29,017
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, of course.Gina is. Gina's happy.

243
00:17:29,017 --> 00:17:31,047
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right, another reason why I couldn't stand being around her.

244
00:17:31,047 --> 00:17:33,917
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And-- you really do all that shit?

245
00:17:33,917 --> 00:17:36,487
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Couples? Random guys fucking you?

246
00:17:36,487 --> 00:17:38,557
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jesus, tara.Ryan, stop.

247
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,087
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This isn't going anywhere, okay?

248
00:17:40,087 --> 00:17:42,357
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So there's no point in having this discussion.

249
00:17:42,357 --> 00:17:44,527
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This has to end.We can't do this anymore.

250
00:17:44,527 --> 00:17:45,797
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are you asking me all this now?

251
00:17:45,797 --> 00:17:48,527
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because I hadn't met him before,and I do care.

252
00:17:48,537 --> 00:17:52,337
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think about you all the time.I can't help it.

253
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:54,407
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And it makes me sick.

254
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,407
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can't get the things he makes you do out of my mind.

255
00:17:56,407 --> 00:17:58,007
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ryan-- how do you think I felt

256
00:17:58,007 --> 00:17:59,907
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Watching him flashing pictures on his fucking phone

257
00:17:59,907 --> 00:18:01,147
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In front of me?

258
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:06,347
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Last night made me sick.It made me fuckin' sick.

259
00:18:06,347 --> 00:18:08,217
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can't do this anymore. This has gotta end.

260
00:18:08,217 --> 00:18:10,217
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's gotta end, hmm?What?

261
00:18:10,217 --> 00:18:11,887
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fucking me for the last four weeks?

262
00:18:11,887 --> 00:18:12,887
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wanna end that?

263
00:18:12,887 --> 00:18:15,327
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop, ryan.

264
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:18,227
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You ever tell him about me?Did you ever tell him

265
00:18:18,227 --> 00:18:20,167
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That you fell in love with me three years ago?

266
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:21,367
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That you dumped me when you realized

267
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:22,537
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was the guy who might not make it,

268
00:18:22,537 --> 00:18:24,067
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That you essentially abandoned me

269
00:18:24,067 --> 00:18:25,597
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For a bunch of rich douchebags?

270
00:18:25,607 --> 00:18:27,067
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And now that asshole?- Ryan!

271
00:18:27,077 --> 00:18:29,277
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who are you, ryan?You're still bartending.

272
00:18:29,277 --> 00:18:31,207
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're still working for randall as a part-time assistant

273
00:18:31,207 --> 00:18:32,747
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At a fucking hotel.

274
00:18:32,747 --> 00:18:34,877
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This dumb little movie's not going to do anything for you.

275
00:18:34,877 --> 00:18:37,117
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then why push me for it?- Oh, I don't know.

276
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:41,447
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because I care about you and knew how much you wanted it?

277
00:18:41,457 --> 00:18:44,457
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See, that's what\ I'm saying, baby.

278
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:47,457
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I loved you so much, baby.We had so much fun together.

279
00:18:47,457 --> 00:18:50,097
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I never got over it when you left.

280
00:18:50,097 --> 00:18:52,297
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It killed me, and I tried so hard to let it go.

281
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,367
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I tried so hard to let go of it.

282
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:56,937
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And just when I think I'm gonna make it without you,

283
00:18:56,937 --> 00:19:00,007
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gina suddenly started talking about her boss's girlfriend

284
00:19:00,007 --> 00:19:02,877
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But this girl she described didn't sound anything like you.

285
00:19:02,877 --> 00:19:08,247
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then when I saw you at that audition...

286
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:11,177
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm still so in love with you.

287
00:19:11,187 --> 00:19:14,487
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't fuckin' want to be,but I am.

288
00:19:16,787 --> 00:19:19,727
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm with him now.I'm with him.

289
00:19:19,727 --> 00:19:21,187
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you thinking?

290
00:19:21,197 --> 00:19:22,857
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think you're gonna nail this guy, move in with him?

291
00:19:22,857 --> 00:19:24,457
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think that creep's gonna marry you?

292
00:19:24,467 --> 00:19:26,167
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ryan, don't go there.

293
00:19:26,167 --> 00:19:28,897
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's hard for me, too, okay?It's hard for me, too.

294
00:19:28,897 --> 00:19:31,867
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's why I tried helping you with the movie 'cause I care.

295
00:19:31,867 --> 00:19:34,137
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you don't have to go and say things that are gonna hurt me.

296
00:19:34,137 --> 00:19:36,837
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Leave him. Get out of there.- And do what?

297
00:19:36,837 --> 00:19:38,707
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. Come back to me. We'll get a job.

298
00:19:38,707 --> 00:19:42,147
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll move in together.Get a job and do what, ryan?

299
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:45,377
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you not remember how hard we were busting our asses?

300
00:19:45,387 --> 00:19:46,847
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you remember those days?

301
00:19:46,847 --> 00:19:49,717
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, wait. Probably not because you're still living them.

302
00:19:49,717 --> 00:19:52,157
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not going back to that, ryan.

303
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:53,887
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not going back to going on auditions

304
00:19:53,897 --> 00:19:55,387
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For jobs I'm never gonna get.

305
00:19:55,397 --> 00:19:57,857
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For bartending for 8 bucks a fucking hour.

306
00:19:57,867 --> 00:20:00,227
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not gonna do it.

307
00:20:00,227 --> 00:20:02,097
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you remember how hard it was for us?

308
00:20:02,097 --> 00:20:04,267
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We were always fucking broke.We were busting our asses.

309
00:20:04,267 --> 00:20:06,107
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We couldn't even pay the fucking rent, ryan.

310
00:20:06,107 --> 00:20:08,007
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We couldn't pay the fucking rent.

311
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:10,737
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That wasn't fun for me.I'm not going back to that.

312
00:20:10,747 --> 00:20:12,407
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I need someone to take care of me.

313
00:20:12,407 --> 00:20:14,647
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I needed someone to take care of me.

314
00:21:15,437 --> 00:21:17,377
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey.Hey.

315
00:21:21,517 --> 00:21:23,477
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Want me to get you something to drink?

316
00:21:23,477 --> 00:21:26,287
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. Water.

317
00:21:43,867 --> 00:21:46,807
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh. How was your day?

318
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:48,567
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was fine.

319
00:21:59,417 --> 00:22:01,847
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why don't you tell me about your day instead?

320
00:22:01,857 --> 00:22:06,587
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. I got up, and I taught two yoga sessions this morning,

321
00:22:06,587 --> 00:22:07,987
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then, oh, I went to that audition,

322
00:22:07,997 --> 00:22:09,697
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, the one that I told you about last time.

323
00:22:09,697 --> 00:22:11,197
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was awful.

324
00:22:11,197 --> 00:22:14,067
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I definitely didn't get the job,but whatever.

325
00:22:14,067 --> 00:22:15,397
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my god, and then sheely called me,

326
00:22:15,397 --> 00:22:18,237
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And she started telling me all about this guy.

327
00:23:06,087 --> 00:23:08,387
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Goddamn it!What?

328
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:09,957
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's wrong?

329
00:23:09,957 --> 00:23:12,657
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why the fuck did you do that? Why?

330
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:14,987
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just get into it with you, okay?

331
00:23:14,997 --> 00:23:17,957
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.I can't help it.

332
00:23:17,967 --> 00:23:19,297
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look...

333
00:23:22,437 --> 00:23:26,067
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This... Is just this.

334
00:23:26,067 --> 00:23:28,307
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What does that mean?

335
00:23:32,307 --> 00:23:35,377
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think you're hot.

336
00:23:35,377 --> 00:23:37,347
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have fun.

337
00:23:37,347 --> 00:23:40,287
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But it's not changing my situation.

338
00:23:49,897 --> 00:23:53,027
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, what's really going on here?

339
00:23:57,737 --> 00:23:59,197
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think tara's seeing somebody.

340
00:23:59,207 --> 00:24:00,737
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, jesus.

341
00:24:00,737 --> 00:24:04,007
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Christian, what does that even mean, okay?

342
00:24:04,007 --> 00:24:06,647
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Considering what you guys do.

343
00:24:06,647 --> 00:24:07,947
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, do you even care?

344
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:11,277
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, I care.I care a lot.

345
00:24:11,287 --> 00:24:14,247
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What, you think she's cheating on you?

346
00:24:17,557 --> 00:24:20,557
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She was acting really, really strange at dinner last night.

347
00:24:20,557 --> 00:24:23,027
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I couldn't figure out why.

348
00:24:23,027 --> 00:24:26,497
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then today she met some guy in the morning for coffee.

349
00:24:26,497 --> 00:24:29,597
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just, she-okay.

350
00:24:29,597 --> 00:24:31,667
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, how do you know that she met someone?

351
00:24:31,667 --> 00:24:34,407
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What, did she tell you?No.

352
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:38,977
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, did--what, did the guy tell you?

353
00:24:41,247 --> 00:24:42,917
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

354
00:24:53,987 --> 00:24:56,427
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've got some stuff I have to do today.

355
00:24:56,427 --> 00:24:58,597
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think you better leave.

356
00:25:05,367 --> 00:25:08,437
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I don't think you should come back here.

357
00:25:12,807 --> 00:25:14,877
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And why's that?

358
00:25:20,887 --> 00:25:23,217
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't handle this anymore.

359
00:25:35,437 --> 00:25:37,167
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Need some cash?

360
00:25:38,237 --> 00:25:40,907
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Christian,I don't need any cash.

361
00:25:40,907 --> 00:25:43,237
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just-- just get out.

362
00:25:49,677 --> 00:25:50,747
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, cynthia.

363
00:25:50,747 --> 00:25:53,387
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get the fuck out.

364
00:26:00,357 --> 00:26:02,857
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get the fuck out of here!

365
00:26:09,337 --> 00:26:11,367
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm really sorry that I didn't congratulate you

366
00:26:11,367 --> 00:26:13,607
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}On starting your own pr company.

367
00:26:13,607 --> 00:26:15,837
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, that must be really exciting.

368
00:26:15,837 --> 00:26:18,107
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't congratulate me just yet.It hasn't really taken off.

369
00:26:18,107 --> 00:26:20,747
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you know,if it wasn't for christian

370
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:23,447
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd never have been able to start it.

371
00:26:23,447 --> 00:26:27,047
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Christian can be very helpful that way.

372
00:26:30,657 --> 00:26:34,887
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So dinner was fun last night.

373
00:26:34,897 --> 00:26:38,927
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry if I, you know,seemed out of it and such.

374
00:26:38,927 --> 00:26:41,127
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was just really preoccupied with things.

375
00:26:41,137 --> 00:26:42,527
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know how christian gets.

376
00:26:42,537 --> 00:26:47,837
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I have to say that ryan was a little shocked by him.

377
00:26:47,837 --> 00:26:50,077
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But he really liked him.He thought he was a great guy.

378
00:26:50,077 --> 00:26:51,507
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, really? He did?

379
00:26:51,507 --> 00:26:53,777
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.Thought he was really cool.

380
00:26:53,777 --> 00:26:55,977
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, good guys are really hard to come by these days,

381
00:26:55,977 --> 00:26:58,247
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you're a very lucky girl.\n- Tell me about it.

382
00:26:58,247 --> 00:27:01,617
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't believe I actually found someone so genuine.

383
00:27:01,617 --> 00:27:03,017
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's a great guy.

384
00:27:03,017 --> 00:27:05,457
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, this was nice.

385
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:08,127
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just, um--

386
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:10,197
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry. I just wanted to know something.

387
00:27:10,197 --> 00:27:12,397
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

388
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:14,397
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are you off the movie?

389
00:27:14,397 --> 00:27:16,267
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, you're not coming to new mexico, right?

390
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:19,337
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no. Yeah, I can't.No, I can't do that.

391
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:22,067
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just curious because I'm finalizing everything,

392
00:27:22,077 --> 00:27:26,447
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, I don't know, you just seemed so into it a month ago.

393
00:27:26,447 --> 00:27:28,507
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I mean...

394
00:27:30,947 --> 00:27:33,087
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, tell me something.

395
00:27:33,087 --> 00:27:35,487
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you really like movies?

396
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,857
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah!

397
00:27:36,857 --> 00:27:39,827
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really, really like movies?Of course!

398
00:27:39,827 --> 00:27:42,427
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When's the last time you went to see a movie in the theater?

399
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:46,027
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A movie that you really thought meant something to you?

400
00:27:46,027 --> 00:27:47,897
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We went to the premiere last week--

401
00:27:47,897 --> 00:27:50,667
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not premieres.Premieres don't really count.

402
00:27:50,667 --> 00:27:51,897
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know, you know.

403
00:27:51,907 --> 00:27:54,937
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess maybe it's just not my thing anymore.

404
00:27:54,937 --> 00:27:57,007
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And plus I don't wanna be away from christian

405
00:27:57,007 --> 00:27:58,077
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For that long, I guess.

406
00:27:58,077 --> 00:27:59,777
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I get it.I totally get it.

407
00:27:59,777 --> 00:28:02,807
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wouldn't want to be away from ryan for that long either.

408
00:28:02,817 --> 00:28:05,847
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, it's just, at the time I was bored,

409
00:28:05,847 --> 00:28:07,587
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I needed something to do.

410
00:28:07,587 --> 00:28:10,687
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And so that's why I got involved, and...

411
00:28:10,687 --> 00:28:14,027
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, now I'm looking for something else to do, so...

412
00:28:22,637 --> 00:28:24,397
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you okay?

413
00:28:24,407 --> 00:28:26,097
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I'm just--

414
00:28:26,107 --> 00:28:27,837
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just have a lot of stuff going.

415
00:28:27,837 --> 00:28:30,407
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm so preoccupied and...

416
00:28:30,407 --> 00:28:33,407
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, I really have to go.

417
00:28:37,347 --> 00:28:39,317
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait! Stop.It's on me.

418
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:41,047
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can bill it to the production.

419
00:28:41,057 --> 00:28:42,817
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Seriously.Tara, it's okay.

420
00:28:42,817 --> 00:28:44,657
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

421
00:28:44,657 --> 00:28:47,357
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good seeing you, gina.Um, we'll talk soon.

422
00:28:47,357 --> 00:28:49,127
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bye.

423
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:50,797
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bye, tara.

424
00:29:06,707 --> 00:29:08,777
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I just had lunch with her

425
00:29:08,777 --> 00:29:10,447
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing.

426
00:29:12,187 --> 00:29:14,387
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She said really nice things about you.

427
00:29:14,387 --> 00:29:19,587
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, she seemed a little tense, but nothing.

428
00:29:19,587 --> 00:29:23,357
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's not coming to new mexico because she said she'd miss you.

429
00:29:23,357 --> 00:29:24,627
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really?

430
00:29:24,627 --> 00:29:25,997


431
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:28,267
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did you think she was gonna say to me?

432
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:29,737
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing, babe.I just want the chance

433
00:29:29,737 --> 00:29:31,367
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For the two of you to reconnect.

434
00:29:31,367 --> 00:29:33,037
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I gotta go.I'll talk to you later.

435
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:35,007
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh, okay.I'll be at the office.

436
00:29:35,007 --> 00:29:37,207
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, babe.See you there.

437
00:29:39,707 --> 00:29:41,947
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, very good. Sexy.

438
00:29:43,477 --> 00:29:45,447
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Keep it.Ha ha.

439
00:29:45,447 --> 00:29:46,917
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pick up your chin.

440
00:29:46,917 --> 00:29:49,147
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, very good. Smile.

441
00:29:49,157 --> 00:29:51,587
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Muscle up. Come on.Give me some attitude.

442
00:29:51,587 --> 00:29:53,487
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's good. Profile.

443
00:29:53,487 --> 00:29:55,627
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lower the chin.Very good.

444
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:59,057


445
00:30:00,197 --> 00:30:01,297
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's pretty cute.

446
00:30:03,367 --> 00:30:05,767
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ryan, on your mark.

447
00:30:05,767 --> 00:30:07,867
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, ryan.That's your name, right?

448
00:30:07,877 --> 00:30:09,937
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right. Get on the mark.

449
00:30:12,347 --> 00:30:14,377
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good. Keep it right there.

450
00:30:14,377 --> 00:30:15,907
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

451
00:30:17,947 --> 00:30:20,017
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, a month. Yeah.

452
00:30:20,017 --> 00:30:21,717
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But zander said he would find someone to take my place

453
00:30:21,717 --> 00:30:23,687
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just until I got back.

454
00:30:23,687 --> 00:30:26,827
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, jeff, zander said it was cool if he gave me his shifts.

455
00:30:26,827 --> 00:30:29,427
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jeff!

456
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:33,627
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jeff, come on, man.I just really need the cash.

457
00:30:33,627 --> 00:30:36,267
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you're gonna make me beg,then fuck it.

458
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:38,937
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll see you later. Bye.

459
00:30:47,447 --> 00:30:49,107
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna head on up.All right.

460
00:30:49,117 --> 00:30:50,747
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks, man.

461
00:31:24,577 --> 00:31:26,717
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're also handling the leo event,

462
00:31:30,457 --> 00:31:33,187
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, I gotta go.Ryan's here.

463
00:31:33,187 --> 00:31:34,787
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know it isn't.

464
00:31:34,797 --> 00:31:37,857
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I think we're all about to find out why.

465
00:31:39,767 --> 00:31:41,397
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Later.

466
00:31:42,897 --> 00:31:45,597
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah! Even on his day off,

467
00:31:45,607 --> 00:31:49,167
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is always a pleasure to see my favorite assistant.

468
00:31:49,177 --> 00:31:51,477
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks, randall, for the first and only compliment

469
00:31:51,477 --> 00:31:52,977
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going to receive today.

470
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:55,807
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I'm sorry.What's wrong?

471
00:31:55,817 --> 00:31:57,377
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I-I was just, uh--

472
00:31:57,377 --> 00:31:59,077
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was just trying to get extra shifts at the bar,

473
00:31:59,087 --> 00:32:00,217
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But jeff's being a prick.

474
00:32:00,217 --> 00:32:02,017
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, what can I do to help?

475
00:32:02,017 --> 00:32:04,157
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I was wondering if there was anything else

476
00:32:04,157 --> 00:32:06,457
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I could do around here.

477
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:09,757
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, when I offered you this job, it was full-time.

478
00:32:09,757 --> 00:32:11,227
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know, I know.

479
00:32:11,227 --> 00:32:14,497
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I let you make it part-time because you wanted it that way.

480
00:32:14,497 --> 00:32:17,097
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Randall, I'm going to new mexico for a month.

481
00:32:17,097 --> 00:32:19,907
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're barely paying me anything to do this movie.

482
00:32:19,907 --> 00:32:21,437
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I really need the cash.

483
00:32:21,437 --> 00:32:22,637
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I ask you something?

484
00:32:22,637 --> 00:32:24,677
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have you ever considered--I don't know.

485
00:32:24,677 --> 00:32:28,747
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Making plans for a sustainable future?

486
00:32:28,747 --> 00:32:29,947
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hmm?

487
00:32:33,187 --> 00:32:35,647
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What am I gonna do with you?

488
00:32:38,927 --> 00:32:41,157
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've been really cool,randall.

489
00:32:41,157 --> 00:32:42,557
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I really, you know--

490
00:32:42,557 --> 00:32:44,457
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know how much I appreciate what you've done for me.

491
00:32:44,457 --> 00:32:46,457
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know you'll have this job waiting for you

492
00:32:46,467 --> 00:32:47,597
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When you get back.

493
00:32:47,597 --> 00:32:49,267
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know that, right?

494
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:51,567
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll have this, at least.

495
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,737
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm so strapped.

496
00:33:06,147 --> 00:33:08,517
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is it?

497
00:33:08,517 --> 00:33:12,087
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, man, I totally forgot I have this appointment.

498
00:33:12,087 --> 00:33:13,527
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, of course you did.

499
00:33:13,527 --> 00:33:16,057
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I will see you tomorrow, ryan.

500
00:33:16,057 --> 00:33:18,057
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I'll see what I can find for you.

501
00:33:18,067 --> 00:33:20,697
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks, randall

502
00:35:13,577 --> 00:35:15,547
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shh. Don't worry, baby.

503
00:35:15,547 --> 00:35:17,347
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gonna be all right.

504
00:35:19,287 --> 00:35:20,717
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gonna be okay.

505
00:36:35,827 --> 00:36:37,197
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He in?Hey. Yeah.

506
00:36:37,197 --> 00:36:39,097
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me just tell him-keep an eye on that for me.

507
00:36:39,097 --> 00:36:40,297
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh--

508
00:36:41,827 --> 00:36:43,097
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, christian.

509
00:36:43,097 --> 00:36:44,897
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No girls allowed.

510
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:48,307
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, christian.

511
00:36:48,307 --> 00:36:49,867
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's that?

512
00:36:49,877 --> 00:36:53,477
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Going over effects the budget will allow.

513
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:55,747
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Even though my boyfriend is the effects supervisor,

514
00:36:55,747 --> 00:36:59,017
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's not doing this for free,so we have to pick and choose.

515
00:36:59,017 --> 00:37:02,047
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That little bitch

516
00:37:04,087 --> 00:37:05,857
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wanna talk to you about something.

517
00:37:05,857 --> 00:37:07,327
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yep?

518
00:37:09,127 --> 00:37:10,297
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is it?

519
00:37:10,297 --> 00:37:12,827
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ryan.

520
00:37:17,937 --> 00:37:19,937
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ryan.

521
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:23,067
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Another topic my boyfriend loves to hate.

522
00:37:23,077 --> 00:37:24,337
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really? Why's that?

523
00:37:24,337 --> 00:37:25,837
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Every movie I've produced,

524
00:37:25,847 --> 00:37:27,847
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He thinks I'm trying to bang the leading man,

525
00:37:27,847 --> 00:37:32,177
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, uh, half the time,he's been wrong.

526
00:37:34,287 --> 00:37:36,487
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want you to call ryan in tomorrow.

527
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:38,787
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell him he's been replaced.

528
00:37:38,787 --> 00:37:40,727
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? Why?

529
00:37:40,727 --> 00:37:43,227
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happened? What's gerald's problem?

530
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:44,527
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This has nothing to do with gerald,

531
00:37:44,527 --> 00:37:46,697
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And ryan's not actually being replaced.

532
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:48,367
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't get it.

533
00:37:48,367 --> 00:37:49,827
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just call ryan in and tell him

534
00:37:49,837 --> 00:37:51,637
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That gerald's thinking of taking him out of the movie.

535
00:37:51,637 --> 00:37:54,767
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you, jon, can convince him otherwise

536
00:37:54,767 --> 00:37:58,307
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If ryan's willing to do something for you.

537
00:37:58,307 --> 00:38:00,577
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like what?

538
00:38:00,577 --> 00:38:03,307
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell him he gets to keep the part if he sleeps with you.

539
00:38:11,417 --> 00:38:13,857
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why the hell would I do that?

540
00:38:13,857 --> 00:38:15,127
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Favor to me.

541
00:38:15,127 --> 00:38:16,957
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not joking, huh?

542
00:38:16,957 --> 00:38:18,997
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I am not.

543
00:38:18,997 --> 00:38:20,897
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Christian,I'm friends with gina.

544
00:38:20,897 --> 00:38:23,467
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ryan is totally straight.

545
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:24,597
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really?

546
00:38:24,597 --> 00:38:27,267
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think he's totally straight?

547
00:38:27,267 --> 00:38:29,307
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what I believe, yeah.

548
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,707
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So how did he get the job at the hotel, huh?

549
00:38:31,707 --> 00:38:35,907
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}'cause he's so straight or 'cause he's so, um, smart?

550
00:38:35,917 --> 00:38:38,017
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Christian, I'm best friends with gina,

551
00:38:38,017 --> 00:38:39,917
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I can't do this to her.

552
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:42,947
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jon, jon, jon.

553
00:38:42,957 --> 00:38:44,857
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Relax.

554
00:38:44,857 --> 00:38:46,817
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just a prank.

555
00:38:46,827 --> 00:38:49,287
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Test ryan, see what his reaction is.

556
00:38:49,297 --> 00:38:51,327
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Afterwards, you can tell him it's a joke.

557
00:38:51,327 --> 00:38:52,997
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And if he has the balls to go to gina

558
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,967
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And tell her about your little prank,

559
00:38:54,967 --> 00:38:56,867
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then just say,"christian put me up to it."

560
00:38:56,867 --> 00:38:59,137
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Blame it on me.I'll take full responsibility.

561
00:38:59,137 --> 00:39:01,307
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chris, I don't think I can do this.

562
00:39:02,877 --> 00:39:06,037
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jon, there are a lot of people in this town

563
00:39:06,047 --> 00:39:07,407
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who call themselves producers.

564
00:39:09,277 --> 00:39:12,017
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're just one.

565
00:39:16,957 --> 00:39:18,787
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

566
00:39:18,787 --> 00:39:20,557
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

567
00:39:20,557 --> 00:39:22,557
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I still don't get it.

568
00:39:22,557 --> 00:39:24,197
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't need to.

569
00:39:24,197 --> 00:39:26,427
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Besides, you might get lucky.

570
00:40:04,967 --> 00:40:06,437
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, tara!

571
00:40:08,007 --> 00:40:09,437
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Baby!

572
00:40:38,737 --> 00:40:41,237
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi.

573
00:40:41,237 --> 00:40:43,507
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What'd you do today?

574
00:40:43,507 --> 00:40:46,507
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I went to the gym.Which gym?

575
00:40:46,507 --> 00:40:49,507
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Equinox.The gym that I'm a member of.

576
00:40:49,517 --> 00:40:51,847
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The one on westwood or the one on sunset?

577
00:40:51,847 --> 00:40:53,687
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The one in west hollywood.

578
00:40:53,687 --> 00:40:55,387
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why'd you go to the one in west hollywood?

579
00:40:55,387 --> 00:40:58,487
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because it was closer to where I was meeting gina for lunch.

580
00:40:58,487 --> 00:41:01,557
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What time did you go to the gym?

581
00:41:04,127 --> 00:41:07,167
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell me something,do you find gina attractive?

582
00:41:07,167 --> 00:41:10,297
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. I'd never hire an assistant I find attractive.

583
00:41:10,297 --> 00:41:11,967
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why not? She's a pretty girl.

584
00:41:11,967 --> 00:41:13,437
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you find ryan attractive?

585
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:14,937
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, here we go.

586
00:41:14,937 --> 00:41:17,637
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I don't.

587
00:41:17,637 --> 00:41:20,307
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I figured you have to find him attractive on some level.

588
00:41:20,307 --> 00:41:21,747
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You cast him as the lead in the movie.

589
00:41:21,747 --> 00:41:23,947
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, that's not true.

590
00:41:23,947 --> 00:41:25,577
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I did not cast him in the movie.

591
00:41:25,587 --> 00:41:28,417
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, you made me cast him as the lead in the movie.

592
00:41:28,417 --> 00:41:30,387
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, we've been over this. I didn't make you do anything.

593
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:32,117
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You hired him as a favor to gina,

594
00:41:32,127 --> 00:41:34,187
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that's why he's in the movie, isn't it?

595
00:41:34,187 --> 00:41:35,827
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Would you fuck him?

596
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:37,697
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did you just fucking ask me?

597
00:41:37,697 --> 00:41:43,267
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I said would... You... Fuck... Him?

598
00:41:45,067 --> 00:41:48,267
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No... I... Wouldn't.

599
00:41:51,677 --> 00:41:55,007
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did actors in the past, and I have two words for them:

600
00:41:55,007 --> 00:41:56,877
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Never again.

601
00:41:56,877 --> 00:41:58,647
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just thought maybe you two knew each other.

602
00:41:58,647 --> 00:41:59,717
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe you met before.

603
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:01,687
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When? When would we have met before?

604
00:42:01,687 --> 00:42:03,387
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please, enlighten me.

605
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:07,157
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe your modeling days when you first got to la.

606
00:42:07,157 --> 00:42:10,287
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, god, no, I hadn't, christian.

607
00:42:10,297 --> 00:42:11,897
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you know, who knows?

608
00:42:11,897 --> 00:42:13,697
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was pretty wasted during those days.

609
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:15,527
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So anything's possible, right?

610
00:42:16,937 --> 00:42:18,167
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

611
00:42:18,167 --> 00:42:20,837
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Christian, why are you asking me these things?

612
00:42:20,837 --> 00:42:23,307
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No reason. You're the one getting all defensive.

613
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:25,277
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm chill, baby.

614
00:42:25,277 --> 00:42:28,047
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are you asking me about ryan?

615
00:42:28,047 --> 00:42:31,147
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just thought maybe the two of you had met before.

616
00:42:31,147 --> 00:42:35,347
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Nope.We had not.

617
00:42:35,357 --> 00:42:37,687
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We had not met before.

618
00:42:38,917 --> 00:42:42,427
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna get another.You want one?

619
00:42:42,427 --> 00:42:43,827
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

620
00:42:43,827 --> 00:42:47,057
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After that interrogation,give me a fucking double.

621
00:42:48,827 --> 00:42:50,767
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How was your day?

622
00:42:51,737 --> 00:42:53,667
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you go to the gym today?

623
00:43:40,187 --> 00:43:41,887
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, babe!

624
00:43:43,717 --> 00:43:46,157
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, babe.How'd it go?

625
00:43:46,157 --> 00:43:49,927
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh, I don't think I got it.Too many other guys.

626
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:51,927
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, babe.

627
00:43:57,937 --> 00:43:59,897
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing?

628
00:43:59,907 --> 00:44:02,607
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Christian does yoga with cynthia gray?

629
00:44:02,607 --> 00:44:05,077
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

630
00:44:05,077 --> 00:44:06,937
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just looking at his schedule.

631
00:44:06,947 --> 00:44:08,277
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you know her?

632
00:44:08,277 --> 00:44:10,617
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Actually, I was in an acting class with her

633
00:44:10,617 --> 00:44:12,117
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A few years ago.

634
00:44:12,117 --> 00:44:14,787
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Weird to see her name again.

635
00:44:14,787 --> 00:44:17,917
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So she's teaching yoga now.Typical.

636
00:44:17,917 --> 00:44:19,457
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right, that's exactly what christian's doing

637
00:44:19,457 --> 00:44:22,557
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When he's over with cynthia. It's yoga. Sure.

638
00:44:25,797 --> 00:44:28,697
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I had lunch with tara today.

639
00:44:28,697 --> 00:44:30,797
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You did?Yeah.

640
00:44:34,807 --> 00:44:36,337
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You okay?

641
00:44:36,337 --> 00:44:39,077
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Yeah, I just--

642
00:44:39,077 --> 00:44:40,877
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. I guess I'm a little surprised

643
00:44:40,877 --> 00:44:42,507
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After what you told me about her last night.

644
00:44:42,517 --> 00:44:46,177
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I know, but christian asked me to go, so--

645
00:44:46,187 --> 00:44:48,487
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why?I don't know.

646
00:44:48,487 --> 00:44:51,087
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was like he wanted me to find out something.

647
00:44:51,087 --> 00:44:54,087
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like what? I really don't know.

648
00:44:54,087 --> 00:44:56,187
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Afterwards, it just confirmed everything he already knew,

649
00:44:56,197 --> 00:44:58,557
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Which is that she doesn't wanna have anything more

650
00:44:58,557 --> 00:45:00,127
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To do with the movie.

651
00:45:00,127 --> 00:45:02,127
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What else did she say?

652
00:45:02,137 --> 00:45:04,037
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I don't think she believed me

653
00:45:04,037 --> 00:45:07,197
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When I told her you thought christian was cool.

654
00:45:07,207 --> 00:45:10,337
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why would you tell her that?Huh?

655
00:45:10,337 --> 00:45:13,307
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That-- why would you say that I thought christian was cool?

656
00:45:13,307 --> 00:45:16,977
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What does it matter? You don't care that I said that, right?

657
00:45:19,517 --> 00:45:20,917
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ryan?

658
00:45:23,257 --> 00:45:25,987
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can tell her whatever you want, babe.

659
00:45:30,127 --> 00:45:32,397
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean,I don't even know her.

660
00:45:34,097 --> 00:45:36,297
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She also seemed--

661
00:45:36,297 --> 00:45:39,337
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know,she seemed scared.

662
00:45:39,337 --> 00:45:42,207
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really anxious.

663
00:45:42,207 --> 00:45:44,577
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She kinda reminded me of like one of those girls

664
00:45:44,577 --> 00:45:50,347
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In those movies that's being followed by somebody.

665
00:45:50,347 --> 00:45:53,717
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I-- I don't know.It was just very weird.

666
00:46:44,497 --> 00:46:46,637
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey!Hey. Is everything okay?

667
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:49,467
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, you said we couldn't talk about this on the phone.

668
00:46:49,477 --> 00:46:50,737
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I asked gina what this was about.

669
00:46:50,737 --> 00:46:52,807
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She had no idea.Ryan, it's okay.

670
00:46:52,807 --> 00:46:54,747
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Close the door.

671
00:46:54,747 --> 00:46:56,877
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But why?

672
00:46:56,877 --> 00:46:59,717
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh, there's no one here.

673
00:47:00,987 --> 00:47:03,687
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Close the door, ryan.

674
00:47:10,827 --> 00:47:12,227
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can we make this fast?

675
00:47:12,227 --> 00:47:14,367
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd rather just stand,if that's okay.

676
00:47:14,367 --> 00:47:15,667
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's going on?

677
00:47:15,667 --> 00:47:17,737
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are you calling me to the office

678
00:47:17,737 --> 00:47:19,697
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At 11:00 at night, jon?

679
00:47:19,707 --> 00:47:22,107
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, I'll be upfront.

680
00:47:22,107 --> 00:47:25,077
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gerald is still having problems with you for the lead.

681
00:47:25,077 --> 00:47:26,577
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know you've known this,

682
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:29,447
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And even though you've been officially cast for this,

683
00:47:29,447 --> 00:47:30,947
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's reconsidering.

684
00:47:30,947 --> 00:47:32,717
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're fucking kidding me.

685
00:47:32,717 --> 00:47:35,717
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. I'm not fucking kidding you.

686
00:47:39,687 --> 00:47:41,587
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What does this mean?

687
00:47:42,827 --> 00:47:44,857
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What does "reconsidering" mean?

688
00:47:44,857 --> 00:47:48,227
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're shooting in a month, jon.I put my whole life on hold.

689
00:47:48,227 --> 00:47:49,897
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sit down.

690
00:47:59,077 --> 00:48:03,107
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm the one with the direct line to chris and gerald.

691
00:48:03,117 --> 00:48:04,947
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Has gina been told about this?

692
00:48:04,947 --> 00:48:07,177
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, gina hasn't been told about this.

693
00:48:07,187 --> 00:48:11,787
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If gina hasn't been told about this, then why am I here?

694
00:48:11,787 --> 00:48:13,157
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm calling her.

695
00:48:13,157 --> 00:48:17,757
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, don't. Put the phone away.

696
00:48:17,757 --> 00:48:20,257
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ryan, put the phone down!

697
00:48:21,797 --> 00:48:24,637
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can make sure you keep the role.

698
00:48:26,907 --> 00:48:28,207
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah?

699
00:48:30,307 --> 00:48:31,437
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How's that?

700
00:48:32,937 --> 00:48:37,847
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I'm going out to, uh,

701
00:48:37,847 --> 00:48:40,577
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Palm springs this weekend,and, uh...

702
00:48:40,587 --> 00:48:44,917
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, why don't you come?

703
00:48:46,157 --> 00:48:48,387
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aren't you going with billy?

704
00:48:48,387 --> 00:48:49,657
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

705
00:48:51,157 --> 00:48:53,157
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You mean me and gina?

706
00:48:53,167 --> 00:48:56,397
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Just, um...

707
00:48:57,697 --> 00:49:00,437
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just me and you.

708
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:11,417
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sure. Why not? But...

709
00:49:11,417 --> 00:49:12,777
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why wait?

710
00:49:12,787 --> 00:49:14,147
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Exactly.

711
00:49:14,147 --> 00:49:16,217
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's do it now.

712
00:49:16,217 --> 00:49:17,817
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah?Yeah.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, I wanted to ask you something.

726
00:51:13,537 --> 00:51:16,067
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who is this?

727
00:51:41,497 --> 00:51:43,927
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going out.Amber texted me.

00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:53,137

732
00:51:53,147 --> 00:51:54,207
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing?

746
00:54:38,407 --> 00:54:40,407
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, it's me.

747
00:54:40,407 --> 00:54:43,607
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need you to come over now.

748
00:56:14,707 --> 00:56:18,577
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, you remember me?No, I don't.

749
00:56:18,577 --> 00:56:23,077
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I used to date christian, you know, before I met you.

750
00:56:23,077 --> 00:56:25,777
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great.You don't seem surprised.

751
00:56:25,777 --> 00:56:28,017
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honestly, I don't really care who christian dated.

752
00:56:28,017 --> 00:56:30,017
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And why would I be surprised?

753
00:56:30,017 --> 00:56:33,257
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Christian went out with a lot of girls before me,

754
00:56:33,257 --> 00:56:34,857
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I don't care.

755
00:56:34,857 --> 00:56:38,327
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I would.I would care.

756
00:56:38,327 --> 00:56:40,397
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}cynthia...

757
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:43,767
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really don't have a clue,do you?

758
00:56:43,767 --> 00:56:47,867
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't know anything about me and christian, do you?

759
00:56:47,867 --> 00:56:50,407
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, you know what?

760
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:52,337
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lay it out, babe. What kind of trouble am I in?

761
00:56:52,337 --> 00:56:54,507
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tara, you know,I have enough of a clue

762
00:56:54,507 --> 00:56:57,007
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To get into contact with you.

763
00:56:57,017 --> 00:57:00,847
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, because I think, you need to get out of this relationship.

764
00:57:00,847 --> 00:57:04,047
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think you need to get away from him.

765
00:57:07,157 --> 00:57:09,187
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really?

766
00:57:09,187 --> 00:57:10,587
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why?

767
00:57:10,597 --> 00:57:14,057
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because he's sick.He's a sick little boy.

768
00:57:15,927 --> 00:57:17,267
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go on.

769
00:57:18,837 --> 00:57:22,537
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, even though he was,you know, fucking other girls,

770
00:57:22,537 --> 00:57:27,307
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There were, of course, the hookups that we did together.

771
00:57:27,307 --> 00:57:30,177
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I never wanted to.I mean, he...

772
00:57:30,177 --> 00:57:32,017
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Always pressured me into them.

773
00:57:32,017 --> 00:57:34,577
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really? You didn't want to?

774
00:57:34,587 --> 00:57:37,387
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm assuming he does the same thing with you.

775
00:57:39,457 --> 00:57:41,527
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just finish your fucking story,cynthia.

776
00:57:41,527 --> 00:57:43,327
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need to get the hell outta here.

777
00:57:43,327 --> 00:57:45,697
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not really a story. No.

778
00:57:45,697 --> 00:57:49,227
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just that moment when everything became clarified for me.

779
00:57:49,227 --> 00:57:52,297
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, one night when things got out of hand.

780
00:57:53,637 --> 00:57:54,907
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How?

781
00:57:54,907 --> 00:57:59,907
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I found myself in the emergency room at ucla.

782
00:57:59,907 --> 00:58:03,147
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hmm. How did that happen?

783
00:58:03,147 --> 00:58:06,377
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Christian decided to invite a bunch of guys over to the house.

784
00:58:06,387 --> 00:58:08,387
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you let him.

785
00:58:08,387 --> 00:58:09,787
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

786
00:58:09,787 --> 00:58:13,087
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Actually, I didn't.I was passed out.

787
00:58:14,527 --> 00:58:16,527
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And who's fault was that, cynthia, hmm?

788
00:58:16,527 --> 00:58:18,627
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your precious christian decided to crush up

789
00:58:18,627 --> 00:58:21,057
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A bunch of rufelin in a drink that he gave me.

790
00:58:21,067 --> 00:58:23,127
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I never called him "precious,"first of all.

791
00:58:23,137 --> 00:58:24,997
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I believe that was your name.

792
00:58:24,997 --> 00:58:27,597
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Secondly, it's "rohypnol."

793
00:58:27,607 --> 00:58:30,367
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Third of all--you know what I meant.

794
00:58:30,377 --> 00:58:31,507
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't believe you.

795
00:58:31,507 --> 00:58:33,337
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really.

796
00:58:33,347 --> 00:58:35,407
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't.

797
00:58:36,777 --> 00:58:39,717
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So what are you saying, cynthia? What are you saying?

798
00:58:41,817 --> 00:58:45,117
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You saying that you didn't let yourself get gang banged,

799
00:58:45,117 --> 00:58:48,287
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That you had no control--he filmed the entire thing,

800
00:58:48,287 --> 00:58:50,087
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then he threatened to put it up on different sites

801
00:58:50,097 --> 00:58:52,157
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I said anything to anybody.

802
00:58:52,157 --> 00:58:55,097
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Obviously you weren't in control of christian. I am.

803
00:58:55,097 --> 00:58:57,397
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm telling you this because I think he's gonna hurt you

804
00:58:57,397 --> 00:58:58,837
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In the same way.

805
00:58:58,837 --> 00:59:01,037
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, you're telling me this because you're jealous

806
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:02,907
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And a little drunk.

807
00:59:02,907 --> 00:59:05,377
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}God, it's such a girl-thing to do.

808
00:59:11,277 --> 00:59:13,417
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, christian's not gonna hurt me.

809
00:59:13,417 --> 00:59:16,617
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If anything, I'm the one that's gonna hurt him.

810
01:00:03,897 --> 01:00:06,637
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's on her way back.

811
01:00:06,637 --> 01:00:08,807
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got 20 minutes.

812
01:00:09,967 --> 01:00:12,877
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are now hacking into ryan's facebook page

813
01:00:12,877 --> 01:00:14,577
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because you have to be friends with him to look at it.

814
01:00:16,107 --> 01:00:20,547

818
01:00:25,917 --> 01:00:28,427
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dude, I've been your tech guy for like three years.

819
01:00:28,427 --> 01:00:30,987
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is up with the paranoia?I've never seen you like this.

01:00:45,607 --> 01:00:49,107
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Christian, uh, you wanted me to check the phone?

822
01:00:51,347 --> 01:00:54,377
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Think I found those deleted texts you wanted me to see.

823
01:00:54,387 --> 01:00:57,587
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Um, not a lot of them, but, uh,

824
01:00:57,587 --> 01:01:02,127

826
01:01:08,567 --> 01:01:11,867
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How quickly can you hack into his bank account?

827
01:01:40,897 --> 01:01:42,267
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who was that?

828

01:01:43,767 --> 01:01:45,767
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The guy that just walked out of the house.

830
01:01:45,767 --> 01:01:48,267
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who in the fuck do you think I'm talking about?

831
01:01:48,267 --> 01:01:50,437
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, he brought me some weed.

832
01:01:50,437 --> 01:01:52,507
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're such a liar.

833
01:01:54,347 --> 01:01:56,677
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How does that make me a liar?

834
01:01:58,277 --> 01:01:59,747
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not just that.

835
01:02:02,887 --> 01:02:04,817
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How was amber?

836
01:02:06,357 --> 01:02:08,357
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wouldn't know.I didn't see amber.

837
01:02:08,357 --> 01:02:09,887
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You didn't? Nope.

838
01:02:09,897 --> 01:02:11,057
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where'd you go?

839
01:02:16,367 --> 01:02:18,637
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's cynthia?

840
01:02:21,967 --> 01:02:23,707
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know who you're talking about.

841
01:02:25,277 --> 01:02:27,007
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop fucking lying, christian.

842
01:02:27,007 --> 01:02:29,207
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know lots of cynthias.What I meant was

843
01:02:29,207 --> 01:02:31,917
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know which cynthia you're referring to.

844
01:02:32,947 --> 01:02:34,377
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fine. Okay.

845
01:02:34,387 --> 01:02:37,447
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Someone texted me because they wanted to talk to me about you.

846
01:02:37,457 --> 01:02:40,587
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Turns out that it's some girl you dated on the east side,

847
01:02:40,587 --> 01:02:42,457
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And not only did you put her in the hospital,

848
01:02:42,457 --> 01:02:44,427
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you invited a bunch of fucking guys over

849
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:46,427
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then pulled a fucking train on her, christian.

850
01:02:46,427 --> 01:02:48,567
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know the whole thing.Wait, wait, wait, wait.

851
01:02:48,567 --> 01:02:50,097
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That didn't fucking happen!Christian, what the fuck?

852
01:02:50,097 --> 01:02:51,937
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, right, I'm sure.No, look.

853
01:02:51,937 --> 01:02:53,767
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I dated a girl named cynthia before you...

854
01:02:53,767 --> 01:02:54,937
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now you remember.

855
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:57,637
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But none of that other shit happened.

856
01:02:57,637 --> 01:02:59,707
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right?

857
01:02:59,707 --> 01:03:02,447
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're such a fucking liar.

858
01:03:02,447 --> 01:03:03,907
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I swear to god!

859
01:03:03,917 --> 01:03:05,577
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If it happened,I would tell you.

860
01:03:05,577 --> 01:03:07,047
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It didn't fucking happen.

861
01:03:07,047 --> 01:03:08,617
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know why she would say that.

862
01:03:08,617 --> 01:03:09,787
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have no fucking clue. Me either!

863
01:03:09,787 --> 01:03:11,187
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know why she would say that either.

864
01:03:11,187 --> 01:03:13,887
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's fucking on drugs,and she's obsessed with me.

865
01:03:13,887 --> 01:03:16,627
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know what the fuck is wrong with-- I-I don't know.

866
01:03:16,627 --> 01:03:18,087
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What kind of drugs was she on? Roofies?

867
01:03:18,097 --> 01:03:21,427
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have no idea. She's crazy. I don't fucking know.

868
01:03:21,427 --> 01:03:26,037
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She probably is jealous that I'm with you instead of her.

869
01:03:26,037 --> 01:03:27,567
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But it did not happen.She's on drugs.

870
01:03:27,567 --> 01:03:28,607
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

871
01:03:28,607 --> 01:03:30,537
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If it happened,I would tell you.

872
01:03:30,537 --> 01:03:32,807
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I swear to god.

873
01:03:32,807 --> 01:03:36,147
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But it did not.Oh. Thanks.

874
01:03:36,147 --> 01:03:39,347
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It didn't though.I swear.

875
01:03:39,347 --> 01:03:41,917
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay

876
01:03:44,787 --> 01:03:47,117
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's that?

877
01:03:48,427 --> 01:03:50,757
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nobody. It's... Whoever.Nobody.

878
01:03:51,757 --> 01:03:54,357
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Christian, who is that?

879
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:56,227
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just somebody I invited over,

880
01:03:56,227 --> 01:03:57,527
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But we can do it another night.

881
01:03:57,537 --> 01:04:01,097
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's fine.We can cancel.

882
01:04:01,107 --> 01:04:04,007
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Tell 'em to come over.

883
01:04:04,007 --> 01:04:07,507
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you sure? I mean, they're close, but...

884
01:04:07,507 --> 01:04:10,147
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Don't cancel.

885

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where you going?

886
01:04:18,787 --> 01:04:22,327
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell 'em to meet me upstairs.

887

892
01:05:17,147 --> 01:05:19,347
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's always nice to cool off.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And he ended up with tara.

917
01:08:16,557 --> 01:08:18,557
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know if I'm gonna find a guy,

918
01:08:18,557 --> 01:08:21,097
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe I just need to get out of la.

919
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:25,637
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, it's a pretty fucked-up town, isn't it?

920
01:08:25,637 --> 01:08:28,537
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sure you don't wanna stay, maybe grab some lunch?

921
01:08:28,537 --> 01:08:30,307
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just wanted to come by and hear what happened

922
01:08:30,307 --> 01:08:31,937
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And to thank you in person.

923
01:08:31,937 --> 01:08:35,107
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It sounded like a weird request, but I appreciate it.

924
01:08:35,107 --> 01:08:37,647
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You took it a lot further than I thought. Thanks.

925
01:08:37,647 --> 01:08:39,817
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}First acting gig I've had in years.

926
01:08:41,447 --> 01:08:43,587
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You really love tara?

927
01:08:43,587 --> 01:08:46,617
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. I mean, I'm with someone, but yeah.

928
01:08:46,617 --> 01:08:47,717
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.

929
01:08:47,727 --> 01:08:50,527
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ryan, I let that go a long time ago.

930
01:08:50,527 --> 01:08:54,997
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You realize that you have to let it go, too, at a certain point?

931
01:08:54,997 --> 01:08:56,367
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know.

932
01:10:26,317 --> 01:10:28,317
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, hey, hey!Why are you following me?

933
01:10:28,327 --> 01:10:30,357
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the fuck are you doing? What do you want, huh?

934
01:10:30,357 --> 01:10:31,587
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know you!

935
01:10:31,597 --> 01:10:34,427
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know who sent you! Come on, admit it!

936
01:10:34,427 --> 01:10:36,897
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fucking christian!

937
01:10:36,897 --> 01:10:39,037
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want my picture, huh?You want my picture?

938
01:10:39,037 --> 01:10:40,137
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's your phone?Give it!

939
01:10:40,137 --> 01:10:42,567
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nobody wants your picture, okay?

940
01:10:45,137 --> 01:10:46,907
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know, okay?

941
01:10:46,907 --> 01:10:49,147
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell christian I know what the fuck he's doing.

942
01:10:49,147 --> 01:10:51,007
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell that piece of shit I know!

943
01:11:09,867 --> 01:11:11,927
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the fuck?

944
01:11:26,217 --> 01:11:28,947
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This can't be my phone.

945
01:11:28,947 --> 01:11:30,587
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck.

946
01:13:24,737 --> 01:13:26,297
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing?

947
01:13:26,297 --> 01:13:28,837
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was just looking for my phone.

948
01:13:28,837 --> 01:13:30,207
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you find it?

949
01:13:30,207 --> 01:13:33,777
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Christian, why is my phone in your drawer?

950
01:13:33,777 --> 01:13:36,347
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, christian-did you find it?

951
01:13:36,347 --> 01:13:38,977
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Christian, why was my phone--I know about you and ryan!

952
01:13:38,977 --> 01:13:40,517
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You fucking lying bitch!

953
01:13:40,517 --> 01:13:42,947
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you gonna fucking admit it? Are you?

954
01:13:42,947 --> 01:13:44,117
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, shit! Are you gonna admit it

955
01:13:44,117 --> 01:13:46,117
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After I beat the fucking shit out of you?

956
01:13:46,117 --> 01:13:47,617
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You fucking lied to me!

957
01:13:47,627 --> 01:13:50,527
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I trusted you, and you lied to me!

958
01:13:50,527 --> 01:13:53,357
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Christian...You lied!

959
01:13:53,357 --> 01:13:59,397
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please! I really don't know what you're talking about!

960
01:14:00,567 --> 01:14:02,637
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jesus!

961
01:14:10,447 --> 01:14:13,717
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my god, I can't believe how late I slept.

962
01:14:16,287 --> 01:14:18,187
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How was your run?

963
01:14:22,787 --> 01:14:26,897
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Babe, why are you drinking tequila at noon?

964
01:14:29,097 --> 01:14:30,597
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ryan.

965
01:14:30,597 --> 01:14:34,867
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm glad your boss is seeing a shrink.

966
01:14:34,867 --> 01:14:37,467
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've been looking at christian's schedule.

967
01:14:37,477 --> 01:14:39,537
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dr. Campbell, 3:00.

968
01:14:39,537 --> 01:14:41,907
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do you know that dr. Campbell's a shrink?

969
01:14:41,907 --> 01:14:44,147
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop it. I googled him.

970
01:14:44,147 --> 01:14:46,377
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing, protecting this psycho?

971
01:14:46,377 --> 01:14:48,277
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why do you even care?

972
01:14:48,287 --> 01:14:50,947
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because he's a sick fuck.

973
01:14:50,957 --> 01:14:54,417
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ryan, I told you, you don't have to like him. Wha--

974
01:14:54,427 --> 01:14:56,957
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The movie's not gonna happen, gina.

975
01:14:56,957 --> 01:14:58,627
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I really don't know what you're talking about right now.

976
01:14:58,627 --> 01:15:00,027
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The movie's not--the movie's happening.

977
01:15:00,027 --> 01:15:01,457
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The movie's not gonna happen.

978
01:15:01,467 --> 01:15:03,697
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ryan, what did--okay, stop. What did jon--

979
01:15:03,697 --> 01:15:05,467
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not jon. It's not gerald.

980
01:15:05,467 --> 01:15:07,737
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not you. It's him. It's christian.

981
01:15:07,737 --> 01:15:09,707
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's not gonna let the movie happen.

982
01:15:09,707 --> 01:15:11,607
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You need to calm down. He's gonna pull out.

983
01:15:11,607 --> 01:15:13,777
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's gonna fuckin' pull out.What are you talking about?

984
01:15:13,777 --> 01:15:16,947
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't understand. What? I don't understand!

985
01:15:16,947 --> 01:15:19,577
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not gonna happen because I've been fucking his girlfriend

986
01:15:19,577 --> 01:15:22,417
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For the last month.

987
01:15:22,417 --> 01:15:27,487
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not gonna happen because..I'm in love with her.

988
01:15:29,027 --> 01:15:32,357
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's why tara stopped working on the movie.

989
01:15:32,357 --> 01:15:35,867
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I never told you this, but we lived together for a year.

990
01:15:35,867 --> 01:15:37,267
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Me and tara.

991
01:15:37,267 --> 01:15:40,267
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She dumped me when she started hooking up with christian.

992
01:15:40,267 --> 01:15:42,837
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hadn't seen her in three years

993
01:15:42,837 --> 01:15:45,307
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Until that day I walked into the audition room,

994
01:15:45,307 --> 01:15:47,807
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then it started again.

995
01:15:47,807 --> 01:15:50,407
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And christian found out.

996
01:15:50,407 --> 01:15:52,077
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's had me followed,

997
01:15:52,077 --> 01:15:54,177
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's fucked with my bank account,

998
01:15:54,187 --> 01:15:56,487
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's insane, and he knows about me and tara.

999
01:15:56,487 --> 01:16:00,317
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's why the movie's not gonna happen, okay? Got it?

1000
01:16:04,927 --> 01:16:07,597
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love you, baby.

1001
01:16:07,597 --> 01:16:10,197
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You believed in me.

1002
01:16:10,197 --> 01:16:16,007
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You helped me so much,but I-- I can't control it,

1003
01:16:16,007 --> 01:16:18,167
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How I feel about her.

1004
01:16:25,247 --> 01:16:27,217
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But she'll never be with you.

1005
01:16:27,217 --> 01:16:31,287
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's not going back to that.

1006
01:16:31,287 --> 01:16:34,457
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can talk about this as much as you want.

1007
01:16:34,457 --> 01:16:38,327
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll spend all day talking about this,

1008
01:16:38,327 --> 01:16:41,027
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then I want you out of here.

1009
01:16:41,027 --> 01:16:42,727
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want you to take all your things,

1010
01:16:42,727 --> 01:16:44,827
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I want you out of here.

1011
01:16:46,297 --> 01:16:48,167
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then I'm going to beg christian

1012
01:16:48,167 --> 01:16:49,537
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To keep the movie going.

1013
01:16:49,537 --> 01:16:51,337
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't care how much I have to degrade myself.

1014
01:16:51,337 --> 01:16:53,337
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I will beg him to keep the movie going.

1015
01:16:53,337 --> 01:16:55,077
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I will make sure that you are not

1016
01:16:55,077 --> 01:16:56,807
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Within a hundred miles of that set

1017
01:16:56,807 --> 01:16:59,317
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For the duration of the shoot.

1018
01:17:03,047 --> 01:17:05,717
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Usually I'm the one in control.

1019
01:17:05,717 --> 01:17:07,957
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Last night I wasn't.

1020
01:17:07,957 --> 01:17:10,087
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}None of it seemed real.

1021
01:17:10,087 --> 01:17:11,957
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not when that guy was sucking my dick

1022
01:17:11,957 --> 01:17:14,597
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or when tara tried to get him to fuck me.

1023
01:17:14,597 --> 01:17:16,897
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Which didn't happen, fyi.

1024
01:17:19,567 --> 01:17:21,097
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There were certain things

1025
01:17:21,107 --> 01:17:25,167
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That tara and the other girl wanted us to do,

1026
01:17:25,177 --> 01:17:29,447
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I don't even know why I care.

1027
01:17:29,447 --> 01:17:34,077
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just some dumb kids on the internet I'll never see again.

1028
01:17:34,087 --> 01:17:37,917
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just...

1029
01:17:37,917 --> 01:17:39,917
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Didn't feel like I wasn't in control.

1030
01:17:39,917 --> 01:17:42,987
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I felt objectified.

1031
01:17:42,987 --> 01:17:45,227
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The way the two of them just watched

1032
01:17:45,227 --> 01:17:48,497
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And told us what to do.

1033
01:17:50,467 --> 01:17:52,897
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Doesn't usually go down like that.

1034
01:17:52,897 --> 01:17:56,237
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Usually I'm the one directing the scene.

1035
01:17:57,507 --> 01:17:59,707
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It made me feel like an actor.

1036
01:17:59,707 --> 01:18:03,577
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's kinda like how I feel when I'm here.

1037
01:18:03,577 --> 01:18:05,247
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You feel like an actor when you are here?

1038
01:18:05,247 --> 01:18:09,487
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're all actors, aren't we? I mean...

1039
01:18:09,487 --> 01:18:11,217
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We all act differently,

1040
01:18:11,217 --> 01:18:14,917
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Depending on the situation we're in or we're around.

1041
01:18:14,927 --> 01:18:20,057
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't act the same way with you as I do when I'm with tara.

1042
01:18:20,057 --> 01:18:24,597
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just last night and here...

1043
01:18:24,597 --> 01:18:26,597
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Were pronounced,

1044
01:18:26,597 --> 01:18:30,337
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That... Disconnect.

1045
01:18:30,337 --> 01:18:34,107
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So do you worry about being an actor when you're here?

1046
01:18:34,107 --> 01:18:36,747
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It doesn't worry me. I just don't like it.

1047
01:18:36,747 --> 01:18:41,417
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't like to feel like I'm not in control.

1048
01:18:41,417 --> 01:18:44,947
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have you processed that coming here is non-negotiable?

1049
01:18:44,957 --> 01:18:46,817
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That it's mandatory?

1050
01:18:46,817 --> 01:18:48,817
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have you been able to accept that?

1051
01:18:48,827 --> 01:18:50,757
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You mean have I processed it?

1052
01:18:50,757 --> 01:18:52,757
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I processed it. I've accepted it.

1053
01:18:52,757 --> 01:18:54,327
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just don't like it.

1054
01:18:54,327 --> 01:18:56,097
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Every day I think what'll happen

1055
01:18:56,097 --> 01:18:58,827
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I don't go back to dr. Campbell's next week.

1056
01:18:58,837 --> 01:19:01,497
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This thought is always on my mind.

1057
01:19:01,507 --> 01:19:03,467
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the answer is?

1058
01:19:06,007 --> 01:19:08,377
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I miss a session,you will call the asshole.

1059
01:19:08,377 --> 01:19:11,077
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The asshole being...My father.

1060
01:19:11,077 --> 01:19:14,117
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And if I told your father you're missing sessions?

1061
01:19:14,117 --> 01:19:18,447
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then the asshole will pull my trust fund if I miss a session.

1062
01:19:22,727 --> 01:19:24,487
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you thinking?

1063
01:19:24,497 --> 01:19:29,127
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm thinking have I been here long enough yet?

1064
01:19:29,127 --> 01:19:30,867
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the answer is?

1065
01:19:46,677 --> 01:19:48,447
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, it's me.

1066
01:19:48,447 --> 01:19:52,047
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You there? I got your little message.

1067
01:19:52,057 --> 01:19:55,287
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ryan, ryan, ryan.

1068
01:19:55,287 --> 01:19:58,287
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Poor, poor ryan.

1069
01:20:00,557 --> 01:20:02,827
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It all seemed so exciting

1070
01:20:02,827 --> 01:20:05,067
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When you were 18, and that photographer found you,

1071
01:20:05,067 --> 01:20:10,837
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Class trip from michigan, all the way out to los angeles.

1072
01:20:10,837 --> 01:20:12,537
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, hollywood.

1073
01:20:12,537 --> 01:20:14,207
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you were suddenly so far away

1074
01:20:14,207 --> 01:20:16,507
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}From that shithole town you grew up in,

1075
01:20:16,507 --> 01:20:18,477
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you did\nsome modeling shoots.

1076
01:20:18,477 --> 01:20:20,677
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everyone was so encouraging.

1077
01:20:20,677 --> 01:20:23,917
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You even did a commercial or two.

1078
01:20:23,917 --> 01:20:27,817
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I saw one on youtube for pringles.

1079
01:20:27,827 --> 01:20:29,827
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Looked like a fucking moron.

1080
01:20:30,857 --> 01:20:33,157
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then what, huh?

1081
01:20:33,157 --> 01:20:34,957
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing.

1082
01:20:34,967 --> 01:20:36,767
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nada.

1083
01:20:36,767 --> 01:20:38,767
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So now you're bartending with the occasional hotel gig

1084
01:20:38,767 --> 01:20:40,467
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To supplement your income.

1085
01:20:40,467 --> 01:20:43,007
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's just 'cause randall wants to fuck you up the ass.

1086
01:20:43,007 --> 01:20:45,137
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who knows?\nYou'd probably let him.

1087
01:20:45,137 --> 01:20:48,037
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He probably has.

1088
01:20:48,047 --> 01:20:51,247
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happened last October at the post ranch inn, huh?

1089
01:20:51,247 --> 01:20:53,047
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You tell gina about that?

1090
01:20:53,047 --> 01:20:55,717
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I doubt you told gina about that romantic drive

1091
01:20:55,717 --> 01:21:02,717
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All the way up the coast to the post ranch inn.

1092
01:21:02,727 --> 01:21:04,987
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then bam!

1093
01:21:04,997 --> 01:21:08,597
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You reconnect with tara last July.

1094
01:21:08,597 --> 01:21:10,167
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then bam!

1095
01:21:10,167 --> 01:21:12,367
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She convinces everyone to cast you in a movie

1096
01:21:12,367 --> 01:21:15,167
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not even capable of acting in.

1097
01:21:15,167 --> 01:21:16,637
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then bam!

1098
01:21:16,637 --> 01:21:18,837
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're fucking my girlfriend.

1099
01:21:18,837 --> 01:21:21,137
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And bam!

1100
01:21:21,147 --> 01:21:25,007
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You convince cynthia to tell everyone some bullshit story.

1101
01:21:25,017 --> 01:21:27,317
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So what, huh?

1102
01:21:27,317 --> 01:21:30,717
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You get tara to dump me?

1103
01:21:30,717 --> 01:21:33,787
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you guys can, what, run away together?

1104
01:21:36,187 --> 01:21:38,427
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get married?

1105
01:21:38,427 --> 01:21:40,197
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you can, what,

1106
01:21:40,197 --> 01:21:43,067
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Coexist in some dump of a house somewhere?

1107
01:21:44,827 --> 01:21:47,397
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Think tara's going back to that kind of life?

1108
01:21:47,397 --> 01:21:50,337
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think she's going to that lifestyle again?

1109
01:21:50,337 --> 01:21:52,507
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want my advice, ryan?

1110
01:21:52,507 --> 01:21:54,637
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go back to michigan and get over it,

1111
01:21:54,647 --> 01:21:57,707
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You clueless little motherfucker.

1112
01:22:10,057 --> 01:22:11,427
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing here?

1113
01:22:11,427 --> 01:22:13,557
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just wanted to talk to you.

1114
01:22:13,557 --> 01:22:14,957
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why?

1115
01:22:21,697 --> 01:22:23,207
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ryan.

1116
01:22:24,737 --> 01:22:29,407
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I had no idea that you two knew each other.

1117
01:22:29,407 --> 01:22:31,407
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Interesting how small this town really is.

01:22:46,157 --> 01:22:48,457
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no way that kid's smart enough

1123

1125
01:22:53,897 --> 01:22:57,337
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What was I supposed to do?

1126
01:22:57,337 --> 01:22:58,807
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It worked, babe.

1127
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:02,837

01:23:07,747 --> 01:23:10,987
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not mad. I thought it was cute.

1130
01:23:12,687 --> 01:23:15,787
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.  It's okay.

1131
01:23:15,787 --> 01:23:20,057
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you really think I would need to slip a girl a roofie?

1132
01:23:20,057 --> 01:23:21,697
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

1133
01:23:24,967 --> 01:23:27,337
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What I am interested in...

1134
01:23:30,267 --> 01:23:32,507
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is how you guys know each other.

1135
01:23:32,507 --> 01:23:34,277
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, it doesn't matter.

1136
01:23:34,277 --> 01:23:37,007
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, but I am curious. How'd you meet?

1137
01:23:37,007 --> 01:23:39,177
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you like him?

1138
01:23:39,177 --> 01:23:41,477
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have you fucked him? Has he got a big dick?

1139
01:23:41,487 --> 01:23:45,387
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, yes, I... I met him\nbefore he knew tara.

1140
01:23:45,387 --> 01:23:47,917
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We had the same acting class together.

1141
01:23:47,927 --> 01:23:51,387
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And yes, we had a thing, and then he met her,

1142
01:23:51,397 --> 01:23:53,527
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then it was over.

1143
01:23:56,927 --> 01:23:57,997
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Very interesting.

1144
01:23:57,997 --> 01:24:00,197
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Interesting?

1145
01:24:01,297 --> 01:24:02,897
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really?

1146
01:24:07,777 --> 01:24:09,607
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why?

1147
01:24:11,507 --> 01:24:14,417
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And why does it even matter to you anymore?

1148
01:24:14,417 --> 01:24:17,247
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did you think she was doing?

1149
01:24:17,247 --> 01:24:22,087
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, I don't know, she dated him for like a year or so,

1150
01:24:22,087 --> 01:24:24,157
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then she dumped him.

1151
01:24:25,897 --> 01:24:27,857
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We didn't know each other very well back then.

1152
01:24:27,867 --> 01:24:29,667
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, we went to like a few of the same parties,

1153
01:24:29,667 --> 01:24:31,827
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I think we dated a few of the same guys,

1154
01:24:31,837 --> 01:24:35,567
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But we weren't really friends or anything.

1155
01:24:35,567 --> 01:24:37,767
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then she met you.

1156
01:24:38,937 --> 01:24:40,007
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Christian?

1157
01:24:43,577 --> 01:24:45,077

1158

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you ever see him again,

1221
01:31:05,827 --> 01:31:08,327
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If he ever contacts you,

1222
01:31:08,327 --> 01:31:11,227
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If he calls you,

1223
01:31:11,227 --> 01:31:13,797
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you're even in the same room together...

1224
01:31:18,437 --> 01:31:20,807
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I will kill him.

1225
01:31:20,807 --> 01:31:22,837
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at me.

1226
01:31:22,847 --> 01:31:27,247
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I will kill him, and I will get away with it.

1227
01:31:31,987 --> 01:31:34,087
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You understand?

1228
01:31:36,427 --> 01:31:37,587
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

1229
01:31:39,297 --> 01:31:41,427
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nod for me, baby.

1230
01:31:46,397 --> 01:31:47,697
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nod for me.

1231
01:31:47,697 --> 01:31:49,837
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, okay.

1232
01:31:50,837 --> 01:31:54,537
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a good girl.

1233
01:31:56,007 --> 01:31:57,577
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good girl.

1234
01:32:13,627 --> 01:32:16,797
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, you guys just got back from dubai.

1235
01:32:16,797 --> 01:32:19,467
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, we stayed at the burj al arab.

1236
01:32:19,467 --> 01:32:21,467
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought you had a bad experience at the burj?

1237
01:32:21,467 --> 01:32:23,707
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thought you were only staying at the atlantis now?

1238
01:32:23,707 --> 01:32:25,307
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, but tara had never been to dubai,

1239
01:32:25,307 --> 01:32:26,777
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I thought it'd be fun for her.

1240
01:32:26,777 --> 01:32:29,877
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It didn't matter to me. I was in meetings all day.

1241
01:32:29,877 --> 01:32:33,977
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So how was dubai? What'd you do there?

1242
01:32:33,977 --> 01:32:38,047
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, just shopped, laid out.

1243
01:32:38,047 --> 01:32:41,557
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Weren't you working on a movie?

1244
01:32:44,227 --> 01:32:46,557
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, uh, kind of.

1245
01:32:46,557 --> 01:32:49,627
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. How'd you know?

1246
01:32:49,627 --> 01:32:53,267
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have a friend in common. Who?

1247
01:32:53,267 --> 01:32:55,697
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Christian.

1248
01:32:55,707 --> 01:32:57,537
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Didn't you used to go out with him?

1249
01:32:57,537 --> 01:33:00,007
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

1250
01:33:00,007 --> 01:33:02,177
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's producing another movie a friend of mine is in,

1251
01:33:02,177 --> 01:33:04,907
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And jaden told me that you and christian used to live together

1252
01:33:04,917 --> 01:33:08,317
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And when I met you tonight, I just put it all together.

1253
01:33:08,317 --> 01:33:12,547
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, christian and I went out for about a year.

1254
01:33:12,557 --> 01:33:14,087
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then when we broke up,

1255
01:33:14,087 --> 01:33:16,417
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I decided to take myself off the film.

1256
01:33:16,427 --> 01:33:18,957
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I'm sorry.Was the breakup that bad?

1257
01:33:18,957 --> 01:33:21,127
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. No, not at all.

1258
01:33:21,127 --> 01:33:25,127
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, it's just, there were a lot of things going on and--

1259
01:33:25,137 --> 01:33:26,597
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait, wasn't that--

1260
01:33:26,597 --> 01:33:29,637
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Was that around the time when that girl was killed?

1261
01:33:29,637 --> 01:33:33,467
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Christian's yoga instructor or something?

1262
01:33:35,847 --> 01:33:37,377
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, actually...

1263
01:33:37,377 --> 01:33:41,447
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, it was right around that time that we broke up, yeah.

1264
01:33:41,447 --> 01:33:44,517
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They never found out who did that, did they?

1265
01:33:47,057 --> 01:33:50,117
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. I mean, they had some suspects,

1266
01:33:50,127 --> 01:33:52,757
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But aside from that, no.

1267
01:33:52,757 --> 01:33:54,727
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At the end, nothing.

1268
01:33:54,727 --> 01:33:59,097
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Didn't they find like a knife in the car of someone's assistant?

1269
01:33:59,097 --> 01:34:04,437
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, but... I mean, I heard that it was basically

1270
01:34:04,437 --> 01:34:07,537
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoever killed the person, her,

1271
01:34:07,537 --> 01:34:09,237
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Must have thrown it in his car.

1272
01:34:09,247 --> 01:34:13,717
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, I was with him that night, so it wasn't him, but--

1273
01:34:13,717 --> 01:34:16,177
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, after that...

1274
01:34:16,187 --> 01:34:19,047
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So they never arrested anybody?

1275
01:34:19,057 --> 01:34:21,057
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Actually, no, they didn't.

1276
01:34:21,057 --> 01:34:23,727
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's so scary.

1277
01:34:23,727 --> 01:34:24,827
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

1278
01:34:24,827 --> 01:34:28,697
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How is christian doing, by the way?

1279
01:34:28,697 --> 01:34:30,697
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Christian, he's, um, he's good.

1280
01:34:30,697 --> 01:34:32,697
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't really talk that much,

1281
01:34:32,697 --> 01:34:35,737
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aside from texts and facebook and stuff.

1282
01:34:35,737 --> 01:34:38,137
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But the last time I heard from him was pretty recent,

1283
01:34:38,137 --> 01:34:41,737
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And he's doing great,actually.

1284
01:34:41,747 --> 01:34:45,807
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gonna go to the ladies' room. I'll be right back.

1285
01:34:55,287 --> 01:34:57,487
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good, good. I'm glad you guys had a good time.

1286
01:34:57,487 --> 01:35:00,227

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I'm here with her right now.

1289
01:35:23,317 --> 01:35:26,847
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, we went to david's place first for drinks.

1290

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So... What do you want me to do?

1292
01:35:32,627 --> 01:35:35,397
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Besides what you already told me to?

01:35:35,397 --> 01:35:40,167
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She seems happy, even though she's like totally faking it.

1294
