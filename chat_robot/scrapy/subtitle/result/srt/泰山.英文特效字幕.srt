51
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,840
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No. You have to take it back.

52
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,880
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Take him back? But he'll die!

53
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,350
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-If the jungle wants him... -I want him.

00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,850
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Does he look dangerous to you?

56
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,370
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Was it alone?

57
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:08,870
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yes. Sabor killed his family.

58
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:12,860
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-Are you sure? -Yes. There are no others.

59

62
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,880
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That doesn't make him my son.

00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:41,870
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}but it's all taken care of.

117
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,550
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hi, guys.

118
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:48,250
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Terk, what is this? Some kind of joke?

119
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,250
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Tell me I'm not looking at the hairless wonder.

120
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,250
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well. Terk said I could come along

121
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,480
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}if I could keep up.

122
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,690
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-Ah, no, Terk, come on! -Terk!

123
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,560
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'll handle this, guys. Okay?

124
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,490
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Listen, buddy, come here.

125
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:04,890
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We got a tiny, little, itsy-bitsy problem here.

126
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:08,420
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Personally, I'd love to hang out with you. You know I would.

127
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,500
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But the guys,

128
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,570
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}they need a little convincing, you know.

129
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,270
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Okay. What do I gotta do?

130
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,000
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Do? What do you gotta do?

131
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,400
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's so stupid!

132
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,500
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What?

133
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,510
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, you gotta...

134
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:23,110
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You gotta go get a hair.

135
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,220
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}A hair?

136
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,590
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yeah, a hair.

137
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:30,590
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}An elephant hair.

138
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,600
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}An elephant hair?

139
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:39,600
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Like I said, it's stupid, right?

140
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:42,200
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Listen, take it from me. Go home, okay?

141
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,990
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Who needs this aggravation? You know?

142
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:47,040
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm probably gonna leave soon myself.

143
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,750
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You go, I'll catch up. All right?

144
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,000
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You see? Leave it to me.

145
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,200
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I told you... Tarzan!

146
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,920
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Tarzan, no!

147
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,220
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That one hurt him.

148
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,250
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Look!

149
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,440
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}There he is! He's alive!

150
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,770
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hey, guys!

151
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:31,950
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hi!

152
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:34,260
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, no. no, no, no!

153
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:37,260
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Come back! Come back!

154
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:40,350
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}This guy's great! If he lives,

155
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:42,250
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}you should bring him around more often.

156
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,060
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Come on, let's go get a better seat.

157
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,270
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-You never get enough sleep. -I get enough sleep.

158
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:55,810
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Mom, are you sure this water is sanitary?

159
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:58,980
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It looks questionable to me.

160
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,280
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's fine, honey.

161
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,620
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But what about bacteria?

162
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:09,390
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Tantor, can't you see mommy's talking?

163
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:16,200
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Watch out! There's something swimming!

164
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,790
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's coming right at you!

165
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:20,200
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Honey, mommy's losing her patience.

166
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,730
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But this time I really see something!

167
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:23,730
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, boy.

168
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,310
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Piranha! It's a piranha!

169
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:29,810
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sweetheart, there are no piranhas in Africa.

170
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:31,600
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Don't tell the kid that.

171
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,440
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Of course there are piranhas in Africa.

172
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,540
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No, she's right.

173
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,240
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}They're native to South America.

174
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,820
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Get outta here. No way!

175
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,820
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Come on. Do you think I'd be standing here if there were?

176
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,430
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's right behind you! Run!

177
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,820
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}For the last time, honey,

178
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,600
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}there are no piranhas in...

179
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,860
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}My butt!

180
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,900
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I told you!

181
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,870
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}There's something on my butt.

182
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:55,040
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What is it? Are there any more of them?

183
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:58,760
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What is it?

184
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,830
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's a piranha!

185
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,850
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Piranha!

186
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,840
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Tantor, where are...

187
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,070
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He's dead!

188
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,070
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We're dead!

189
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:34,880
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We didn't do it! They're the ones!

190
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:55,890
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, thank you, Kerchak.

191
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:01,100
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Tarzan, buddy! Buddy, come on.

192
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,300
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Tarzan, don't die on me.

193
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,510
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You weren't supposed to do it!

194
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,700
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Get away from there!

195
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,600
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Don't you know a piranha can strip your flesh in seconds?

196
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,910
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What? He's not a piranha! He's...

197
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:13,910
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He's alive!

198
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:17,410
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-He's alive! He's alive! -He's alive!

199
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:19,920
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He's alive... You idiot!

200
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,850
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You nearly gave me a heart attack. You happy?

201
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,450
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You... I don't believe it.

202
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:27,850
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You got the hair?

203
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,850
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Is that what this is all about?

204
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:31,860
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I got a whole tail of them.

205
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,860
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-Tarzan! -Terkina!

206
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,560
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, no!

207
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,860
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Who's that?

208
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,860
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}My mom.

209
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,570
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-Tarzan! -Hi!

210
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:41,870
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hi, aunt Kala.

211
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,870
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, you scared me! What happened?

212
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:44,870
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, I...

213
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:46,570
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's sort of a long...

214
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:48,980
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's involved because what happened...

215
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:49,870
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It was a weird...

216
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:52,080
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What happened?

217
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,880
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It was my fault, Kerchak.

218
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,880
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Tarzan!

219
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,290
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We were playing and well...

220
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:01,890
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm sorry, Kerchak.

221
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:04,090
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You almost killed someone!

222
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:06,470
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-But it was an accident. -He's only a child.

223
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:08,970
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That's no excuse, Kala! You can't keep defending him!

224
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:09,590
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But he'll learn!

225
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:10,600
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He will never learn!

226
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,000
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You can't learn to be one of us.

227
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,550
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Because you never give him a chance!

228
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,000
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Give him a chance?

229
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,600
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Kala, look at him.

230
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,200
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He will never be one of us.

231
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,880
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Kerchak!

232
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,680
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Tarzan!

233
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:16,140
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Tarzan, what are you doing?

234
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:19,140
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Why am I so different?

235
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:21,300
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Because you're covered with mud. That's why.

236
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,370
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No! Kerchak said I didn't belong in the...

237
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:25,070
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Close your mouth.

238
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,770
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Kerchak said I don't belong in the family.

239
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:28,570
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Never mind what kerchak said.

240
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:30,480
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Now, hold still!

241
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,080
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But, look at me!

242
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,580
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I am, Tarzan. And do you know what I see?

243
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:42,160
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I see two eyes, like mine.

244
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,560
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And a nose... somewhere.

245
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,170
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ahh... Here!

246
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,100
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Two ears!

247
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,400
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And, let's see. What else?

248
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,600
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Two hands?

249
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,090
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That's right.

250
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:14,800
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Close your eyes.

251
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,620
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Now forget what you see.

252
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:20,130
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What do you feel?

253
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,200
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}My heart.

254
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,200
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Come here.

255
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,540
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-Your heart. -see?

256
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:30,200
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We're exactly the same.

257
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:36,210
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh! Kerchak just can't see that.

258
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,220
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'll make him see it!

259
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,220
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'll be the best ape ever!

260
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,220
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, I bet you will.

00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:51,040
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I thought you knew everything.

00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,040
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hello, Terk.

300
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,140
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Not the neck. Not the neck there.

301
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:10,320
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Whoa! Okay. It's all fun and games till someone loses an eye.

302
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,130
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Please stop. Somebody's gonna get hurt.

303
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:15,060
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Cramp in the calf!

305
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,640
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Let go!

306
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,070
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, sorry, Terk.

307
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:26,070
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What kind of animal are you?

308
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,070
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You know, I've been thinking lately

309
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:30,470
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}that maybe Tarzan could be some subspecies of elephant.

310
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:33,080
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What, are you crazy? An elephant?

311
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,080
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Listen to me. Think about it.

312
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,580
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He enjoys a peanut. I enjoy a peanut.

313
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,680
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He looks nothing like you!

314
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,930
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Okay, everybody, move aside. Outta my way!

315
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:31,730
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Best friend coming through. That would be me.

316
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:34,330
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And you, don't make a habit of that, okay?

317
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:36,340
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}There are other ways of getting attention. You know?

318
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:39,340
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-I'll try to remember that. -All right.

319
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:42,030
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I was right behind you if you needed me.

320
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:20,680
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What was that?

321
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,780
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It wasn't me. I swear!

322
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,390
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-Okay, maybe it was. -Everyone!

323
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:29,080
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Let's move.

324
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:20,000
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}This reminds me of the safari I led up the Zambezi.

325
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,040
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Back, back, back, back, back.

326
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,450
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ooh, was it scary there.

327
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,040
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Two men with only three rifles. We blasted away.

328
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:35,440
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That's when I knew I was born for Africa!

329
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:38,000
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And Africa was created for...

330
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,470
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Clayton! Clayton! Oh, there you are.

331
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:53,470
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What is it? What is it, Clayton? Are we in danger?

332
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:55,480
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I thought I saw something.

333
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:59,210
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Is it a hippopotamus amphibious, or a rhinoceros bihornus?

334
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:01,480
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-Professor, don't move! -Ah, right.

335
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,680
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Daddy?

336
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:08,080
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Daddy, what's all the hullabaloo about?

337
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,890
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What is it, daddy?

338
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:15,950
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Mr. Clayton asked me not to move. He saw something.

339
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:20,500
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, I moved.

340
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:23,880
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Mr. Clayton, sorry. Excuse me, uh...

341
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,950
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}but my father and I came on this expedition

342
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:27,730
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}to study gorillas.

343
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,490
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I believe your shooting might be scaring them off.

344
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,840
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You hired me to protect you, Miss Porter,

345
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,660
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}and protect you I shall.

346
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,390
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And you're doing a marvelous job of it.

347
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:40,810
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We only have a short time before the ship returns...

348
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:44,810
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Jane! Jane, do you realize what you're standing in?

349
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,830
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-A gorilla's nest! -Oh, daddy!

350
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:50,820
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}At last, our first sign in days!

351
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:53,830
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-Do you think the beasts could be nearby? -Could be.

352
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:58,230
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}There's the evidence. Not very far, anyway.

353
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:00,440
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-Daddy, look! Over there and there! -Where?

354
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,840
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh,yes, more nests! I see them!

355
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,270
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-Just as you predicted. -Whole family groups!

356
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:06,830
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Jane, I love you!

357
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,780
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Family groups? Excuse me,

358
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,390
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But these are wild beasts

359
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:16,000
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}that would sooner tear your head off than look at you.

360
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,650
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}On the contrary, Mr Clayton.

361
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:20,080
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Daddy's theory is that these are social creatures...

362
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:27,790
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Mr. Clayton, please!

363
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:29,090
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What if it's a gorilla?

364
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:32,000
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's no gorilla.

365
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,800
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hmm. But perhaps we should press on.

366
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,800
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yes, indeed.

367
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,800
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We should keep heading west

368
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,810
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}following the ganoderma ablonatum.

369
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:43,410
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Excellent, professor!

370
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:46,920
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I could have used your expertise on my last safari.

371
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:56,900
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Are you what all the fuss was about?

372
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:59,900
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Daddy! Daddy, quick!

373
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:01,900
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No, wait, wait. Hold still.

374
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,900
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, my. Oh, my good...

375
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,310
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You may not be a gorilla,

376
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:09,000
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}but you are one sweet little...

377
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:15,000
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Huh. There you go. What do you think?

378
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:20,420
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What? Oh!

379
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,920
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Why, you little...

380
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,530
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, this is absolutely peachy!

381
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:26,720
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Come to study gorillas,

382
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,920
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}and get my sketchbook pinched by a baboon!

383
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:39,540
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Give me that!

384
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:42,870
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Come on now, enough of this.

385
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:44,930
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I want this paper on the count of three.

386
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:47,950
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}One, two...

387
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:50,950
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, look, bananas!

388
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:54,940
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I can't believe you fell for that one!

389
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:59,550
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No, no, don't give me those crocodile tears.

390
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:02,050
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What would your parents have to say?

391
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,460
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh! See, I told you they'd be cross.

392
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:10,070
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Go easy on him. Children will be children.

393
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:33,980
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh! I'm flying! What on earth am I...

394
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:39,990
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Get off! Get off!

395
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,000
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh! Put me down! Put me down!

396
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,500
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No! Pick me up, pick me up!

397
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:58,410
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, no!

398
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:17,940
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Unhand me!

399
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:40,550
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Over there!

400
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:34,100
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm in a tree with a man who talks to monkeys.

401
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:36,620
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ooh, I can't do this! I can't... Oh!

402
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:39,120
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}This is good. This is... very good.

403
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:43,110
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Wait. One, two...

404
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,120
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It can't get any worse, can it?

405
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:55,130
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Obviously, it can.

406
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,870
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Stay back. No, don't come...

407
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:06,670
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Don't come any closer. Please, don't.

408
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:08,270
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What are... What are you doing?

409
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:13,150
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Please don't. That tickles.

410
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:15,550
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No, get off, get off... get off!

411
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:17,160
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It serves you right.

412
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,680
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Stay away from me.

413
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,080
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Like a very good wild man.

414
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:23,090
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You, stay. I'm warning you.

415
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:24,690
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}My father won't take kindly to you...

416
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:27,390
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No. That's... Now, that's close enough.

417
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:32,160
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}How dare you? Wha...

418
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:21,210
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, dear. Oh, dear, Oh, dear. Oh, dear!

419
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:22,400
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yes, thank you.

420
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,150
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's a lovely heartbeat.

421
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:27,210
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's very nice.

422
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,230
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's very nice.

423
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:30,930
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, thank you.

424
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:33,270
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I can't do a thing with it in this humidity though. It's...

425
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:35,640
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You... You do speak.

426
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,860
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And all this time I thought you were just a big, wild, quiet,

427
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,560
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}silent person-thing.

428
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,160
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Why didn't you tell me? I must say

429
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:45,160
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm rather curious as to who you are. I'd love...

430
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:48,000
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Tarzan.

431
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,850
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Tarzan.

432
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:56,880
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Tarzan.

433
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:01,260
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, I see!

434
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:04,260
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, I see!

435
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,570
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Tarzan.

436
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,670
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, I see.

437
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:10,270
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No, no, no. No.

438
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,270
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm Jane.

439
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:17,270
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No, no, no. No. I'm Jane.

440
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:23,070
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}no, no. Jane. Tarzan.

441
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,280
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Jane.

442
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:29,280
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-Jane. -Exactly.

443
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,680
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Clayton!

444
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,330
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Clayton!

445
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:38,300
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Extraordinary!

446
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:43,290
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Um, please, can you take me to my camp?

447
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:47,310
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yes! Clayton! Wonderful!

448
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:51,800
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Um, could we... Um, can't we walk?

449
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,700
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Can't we walk?

450
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:59,720
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-Tarzan! -Tarzan, where are you?

451
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,920
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Let's hope we find him before Kerchak does.

452
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,750
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Maybe he's lost.

453
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:04,320
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Or found something more interesting.

454
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,250
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What, are you nuts?

455
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:07,360
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What could be more interesting than us?

456
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,330
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What's everybody looking at?

457
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:20,930
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The horror! It's gruesome! Hide me!

458
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:23,840
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Pull yourself together. You're embarrassing me.

459
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:28,640
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-These things aren't alive. -I knew that.

460
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:32,140
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-Tarzan! -Tarzan?

461
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,280
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hello?

462
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,280
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What kind of primitive beasts

463
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,280
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}are responsible for this mess?

464
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:49,290
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Wow! Come here, you guys!

465
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:50,890
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Come here, come here, come here. Look at this!

466
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:53,370
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What is that? Funny.

467
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:03,370
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hey, do it again. Do it again.

468
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,380
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Like this?

469
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,390
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yeah!

470
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:11,390
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yeah, rip it!

471
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:14,990
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I love that part!

472
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:18,400
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Let me hear it, big fella.

473
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:21,400
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Now, hit it!

474
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,900
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Nice!

475
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,410
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What the heck? Bye-bye.

476
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:34,410
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Terk!

477
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:36,420
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yeah, Tant?

478
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:40,410
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Now! Hit it! Come on, Tantor!

479
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:43,420
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, I love it!

480
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:45,350
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Stay with me, fellas.

481
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:48,060
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I feel something happening here.

482
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,000
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ahh, gorillas!

483
00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:28,930
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He's one of them!

484
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:51,960
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, my...

485
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:29,090
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Jane! Jane! Jane!

486
00:45:31,130 --> 00:45:33,400
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Jane, where are you?

487
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:37,010
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Jane! Oh, Jane! Oh, thank goodness.

488
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:38,610
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Good heavens, what happened?

489
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:39,710
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Are you all right?

490
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:41,240
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We've been everywhere looking for you.

491
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,400
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, my goodness! Daddy!

492
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,250
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-I was out walking. I was... -Yes, yes.

493
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:49,220
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Little baby monkey. I drew a picture.

494
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:50,050
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yes, go on.

495
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:51,420
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Suddenly the monkey starts crying.

496
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:53,160
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-Oh, poor thing. -I turned around and there's

497
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,760
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-a whole fleet of them! -Of what?

498
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,460
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}There's an army of monkeys.

499
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:58,420
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Monkeys? Monkeys!

500
00:45:58,460 --> 00:45:59,700
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Screaming at me!

501
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,960
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That's theripithicus baboonus.

502
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,300
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-She's very good at this. -Oh, really?

503
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:04,470
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Terrified I was. Terrified.

504
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:07,800
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And suddenly, I was swinging in the vines.

505
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:08,270
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}With the monkeys, yes?

506
00:46:08,270 --> 00:46:09,870
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Swinging, flying. I was in the air.

507
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:11,000
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}In the air, yes, I know.

508
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,500
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-And I'm all surrounded. -What did you do?

509
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,680
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And daddy, they took my boot.

510
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,480
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}They took... Those are the ones I bought you.

511
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:17,480
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And I was saved!

512
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:21,780
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I was saved by a flying wild man in a loincloth.

513
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:22,990
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Loincloth? Good lord.

514
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:24,490
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What is she talking about?

515
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:26,490
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I haven't the foggiest idea.

516
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:27,790
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Takes after her mother, you know.

517
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:29,490
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}She'd come up with stories like that.

518
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:30,790
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Not about men in loincloths, of course.

519
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:33,660
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-And there were gorillas. - Gorillas?

520
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:36,770
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You saw the gorillas? Where, Jane, where?

521
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,770
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He left with them.

522
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,770
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Who, dear, who?

523
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,770
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Tarzan.

524
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:46,760
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-Tarzan? -The ape man.

525
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:52,960
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Everyone, we will avoid the strangers.

526
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,300
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Do not let them see you,

527
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:55,500
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}and do not seek them out.

528
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,000
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}They mean us no harm, Kerchak.

529
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,700
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Tarzan, I don't know that.

530
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:00,000
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But I do. I've spent time with them.

531
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,010
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You may be willing to risk our safety, but I'm not.

532
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:05,980
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Why are you threatened by anyone different from you?

533
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:12,670
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Protect this family, and stay away from them.

534
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:18,990
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Tarzan, for once listen to Kerchak.

535
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:22,980
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Why didn't you tell me there were creatures that looked like me?

536
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:32,840
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, he didn't stand upright,

537
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:35,500
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-he sort of crouched, like that. -Really?

538
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,040
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Supported his weight on his knuckles.

539
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,710
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-On the knuckles! -See?

540
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:41,410
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-Exactly like a gorilla! -Extraordinary!

541
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:43,010
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ah, it was amazing!

542
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:45,050
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And he bends his elbows out like this,

543
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:47,050
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}and then he walks like this.

544
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:50,020
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, I see! Like aunt isabel!

545
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:53,020
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}This is capital!

546
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:55,730
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, Janey, Jane! What a discovery!

547
00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:58,030
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}A man with no language, no human behavior...

548
00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:00,450
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And no respect for personal boundaries.

549
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:02,770
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-How do you mean? -He was this close, Daddy!

550
00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:04,070
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Staring at me.

551
00:48:04,070 --> 00:48:07,570
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He seemed confused at first,

552
00:48:07,570 --> 00:48:10,340
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}as if he's never seen another human before.

553
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:12,740
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}His eyes were intense,

554
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:15,750
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}and focused and...

555
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:19,740
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I've never seen such eyes.

556
00:48:21,090 --> 00:48:23,150
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, shall I, ahem,

557
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:26,450
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}leave you and the blackboard alone for a moment?

558
00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:28,500
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Daddy, stop it.

559
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:29,500
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The point is,

560
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:30,910
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}think of what we could learn from him.

561
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:33,470
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We must find him.

562
00:48:33,770 --> 00:48:37,850
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Professor, you are here to find gorillas,

563
00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:40,240
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}not indulge some girlish fantasy.

564
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:44,230
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Fantasy? I didn't imagine him! Tarzan is...

565
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:46,750
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Real.

566
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:51,290
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ah! It's him! It's, it's, it's him. Tarzan!

567
00:48:51,290 --> 00:48:53,350
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-Professor! Jane! Stand back! -Wait!

568
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:55,760
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No!

569
00:48:55,790 --> 00:48:57,760
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Clayton.

570
00:48:59,790 --> 00:49:01,760
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Clayton.

571
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,060
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Have we... met?

572
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,770
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}How does he know my name?

573
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,770
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He thinks it means the sound of a gunshot.

574
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:13,460
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-Jane. -Yes, hello, mmm, Tarzan.

575
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:15,780
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I see what you mean about those personal boundaries.

576
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What's he doing?

577
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:21,080
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Look at him, Jane.

578
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:23,780
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Moves like an ape but looks like a man.

579
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:26,490
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He could be the missing link!

580
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:29,790
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Or our link to the gorillas.

581
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:32,530
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ahh, yes, yes.

582
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:35,790
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Where are the gorillas?

583
00:49:36,830 --> 00:49:39,800
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Go-ril-las!

584
00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:41,800
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Go-ril-las!

585
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:43,440
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Shouting won't help, Mr. Clayton.

586
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,840
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He doesn't understand English.

587
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:46,810
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Then I'll make him understand.

588
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:49,810
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}If I can teach a parrot to sing god save the queen,

589
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:53,800
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I can certainly teach this savage a thing or two.

590
00:49:54,850 --> 00:49:57,820
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Go-rilla.

591
00:49:57,850 --> 00:50:01,320
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-Go-rilla. -Oh-ho! He's got it!

592
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:04,220
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Gorilla. Gorilla!

593
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:07,000
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-Perhaps not. -No, no, no, no!

594
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,660
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-No, no, no, no, no! -No, no, no. Give me that.

595
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:11,530
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No, no. Leave that. No.

596
00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:14,820
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Mr. Clayton, I think I'll take it from here.

597
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,850
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}# whatever you do #

598

00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:54,290

629
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:57,990
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The boat could arrive any day. Now ask him straight out.

630
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,000
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Tarzan?

631
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:05,410
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Will you take us to the gorillas?

632
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:07,310
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Do you understand?

633
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:09,510
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I understand.

634
00:53:09,510 --> 00:53:11,510
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-Ooh! Good work, Jane. -Well?

635
00:53:11,510 --> 00:53:13,510
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I can't.

636
00:53:13,510 --> 00:53:15,620
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-What? What? -Why not, Tarzan?

637
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:17,220
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Kerchak.

643
00:53:57,290 --> 00:54:01,260
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, Terk, I've never seen him so happy.

644
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:03,300
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Eh, I give it a week.

645
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:08,300
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Cut her loose!

646
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:12,670
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-Come on. -All right, move it, you field rats.

647
00:54:13,310 --> 00:54:15,600
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Put your back into it.

648
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:18,680
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Wait, please. Don't... I've waited 30 years for this,

649
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:21,280
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}and I won't leave until I see a gorilla.

650
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:23,280
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, isn't this dreadful, Tarzan?

651
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:27,280
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Whoa! No, no. wait.

652
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,890
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You're the captain.

653
00:54:31,890 --> 00:54:33,830
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Just tell them you've had engine trouble

654
00:54:33,830 --> 00:54:35,330
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}and give us two more days.

655
00:54:35,330 --> 00:54:37,700
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And be late at every port from here to London?

656
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:39,300
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We'll have come all this way for nothing.

657
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:43,290
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm sorry, Miss Porter, but I simply can't do it.

658
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:46,100
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Agh! This is your fault.

659
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:47,340
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I should've followed my instincts

660
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:49,340
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}and set traps for the beasts.

661
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:52,010
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Don't you think I'm disappointed about the gorillas?

662
00:54:52,010 --> 00:54:55,320
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You are absolutely impos...

663
00:54:55,350 --> 00:54:58,320
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Tarzan! I was so afraid you wouldn't come in time.

664
00:54:58,350 --> 00:55:01,120
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The boat's arrived. The boat that's...

665
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:03,320
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}come to take us home to England.

666
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:07,320
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And daddy and I were wond... Well, I was wondering...

667
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:11,070
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, we really hope that you'll come with us.

668
00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:13,370
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Won't you?

669
00:55:13,370 --> 00:55:16,590
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Go see England today, come home tomorrow.

670
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:18,340
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, no.

671
00:55:18,370 --> 00:55:23,330
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, you see, it would be very difficult to come back... ever.

672
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:24,740
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Not come back?

673
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:26,380
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, no, no. I know it sounds awful,

674
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:28,100
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}but you belong with us.

675
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:31,100
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-With people. -Jane must stay with Tarzan.

676
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:34,350
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Wh... Stay here? Oh, no, no. My laundry.

677
00:55:34,390 --> 00:55:38,350
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No, I can't stay. Look, I've got...

678
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:40,690
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I've got my father and...

679
00:55:40,690 --> 00:55:44,350
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Jane, stay.

680
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,370
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-But... -Please.

681
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:51,790
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But... I can't.

682
00:55:54,010 --> 00:55:55,380
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Women!

683
00:55:55,710 --> 00:55:58,680
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}How typical! Thank you, Jones.

684
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:02,220
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Even if you hadn't grown up a savage, you'd be lost.

685
00:56:02,770 --> 00:56:06,390
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}There are no trails through a woman's heart.

686
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:08,390
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Jane is going.

687
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:14,380
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yes. If only she could've spent more time with the gorillas.

688
00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:16,660
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}She's so disappointed.

689
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:19,400
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Crushed, really.

690
00:56:19,430 --> 00:56:22,400
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sorry, old boy.

691
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:26,400
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, well. I'd best get Jane's things to the ship.

692
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:33,410
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Clayton!

693
00:56:33,450 --> 00:56:35,420
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}If Jane sees gorillas,

694
00:56:35,450 --> 00:56:37,420
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}she stays?

695
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:41,410
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Say, that's why she came, isn't it?

696
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:44,420
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'll do it.

697
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:47,430
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-Good man! Snipes? -sir?

698
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:51,770
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Get the boys together. There's gonna be a change in plans.

699
00:56:52,170 --> 00:56:54,430
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Terk, all you have to do is get Kerchak out of the way.

700
00:56:54,470 --> 00:56:56,440
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-What? -I'd be happy to get kerchak...

701
00:56:56,470 --> 00:56:59,440
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Shut your trunk and get me outta here.

702
00:56:59,470 --> 00:57:02,440
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Can you believe that guy?

703
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:06,000
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Drops us like a newborn giraffe... Kerplop!

704
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,450
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Now waltzes in here and expects us to just...

705
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:12,450
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Terk, I'm asking you as a friend.

706
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,460
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}With the face and the eyes, and the...

707
00:57:17,490 --> 00:57:19,460
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}All right!

708
00:57:19,490 --> 00:57:22,460
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But don't make me do anything embarrassing.

709
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,880
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm gonna kill him!

710
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:28,460
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}A-actually, I thought that dress was rather slimming on you.

711
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:31,200
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, really? I thought it was a little revealing and kind of...

712
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:37,480
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}How does she move in this thing?

713
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Look out!

714
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:10,510
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-Oh, look, daddy. -Where? Wh... wh...

715
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:12,880
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Jane!

716
00:58:13,850 --> 00:58:16,710
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Be careful, professor.

717
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:21,510
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}She's beautiful.

718
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:23,520
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}She's my mother.

719
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:27,520
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Th... this is your...

720
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:31,520
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Mother.

721
00:58:38,570 --> 00:58:41,000
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Wh-what's happening?

722
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:42,540
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I don't know, daddy.

723
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:44,580
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, it's getting away!

724
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:48,570
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No! You'll only frighten her more.

725
00:58:54,590 --> 00:58:58,000
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, yes. Absolutely, my dear. Good idea.

726
00:58:58,590 --> 00:58:59,880
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What are you doing?

727
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:01,590
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Do you want to frighten them off?

728
00:59:01,590 --> 00:59:03,560
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Get up! Get...

729
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:07,000
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Don't get up.

730
00:59:36,770 --> 00:59:38,770
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hello.

731
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:46,600
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's very nice to meet you, too.

732
00:59:48,990 --> 00:59:52,660
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, your majesty, you're such a tease.

733
00:59:54,650 --> 00:59:57,990
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hello. Hello. Uh, Archimedes Q. Porter at your service.

734
00:59:58,990 --> 01:00:00,330
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Quite a grip you've got.

735
01:00:00,990 --> 01:00:02,620
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, thank you.

736
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:04,660
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Is that one of mine?

737
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:08,330
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, this is wonderful, Mr. Clayton!

738
01:00:08,330 --> 01:00:09,990
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Look! Look! Social grooming.

739
01:00:09,990 --> 01:00:13,620
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Congratulations, professor.

740
01:00:13,670 --> 01:00:17,630
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Our dream has come true.

741
01:00:20,570 --> 01:00:22,770
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Give me that! Hey, what're you doing?

742
01:00:22,770 --> 01:00:25,950
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Stop that! Stop! Hold on, now! Leave that!

743
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:28,700
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That is not to be played with!

744
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:45,990
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-Can you teach me? -Speak gorilla?

745
01:00:46,550 --> 01:00:48,000
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yes.

746
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:12,690
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Good heavens! What did I say?

747
01:01:12,730 --> 01:01:15,700
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That Jane stays with Tarzan.

748
01:01:15,730 --> 01:01:18,700
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Stay? But I thought we'd already...

749
01:01:18,730 --> 01:01:21,700
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But, Tarzan, I, I...

750
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,000
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Look out!

751
01:01:27,110 --> 01:01:30,700
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-Is that my dress? -Oh, no.

752
01:01:33,750 --> 01:01:36,720
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, daddy.

753
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:40,710
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Give it to me!

754
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No!

755
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Go!

756
01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:08,990
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-Wait! Wait! Tarzan! -Go now!

757
01:02:08,990 --> 01:02:12,740
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Jane, quickly! Hurry! Come along.

758
01:02:31,810 --> 01:02:34,330
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Kerchak, I didn't...

759
01:02:34,330 --> 01:02:38,330
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-I'm sorry, I... -I asked you to protect our family,

760
01:02:39,110 --> 01:02:42,770
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}and you betrayed us all.

761
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:13,810
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm so confused.

762
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:17,000
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Come with me.

763
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,810
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}There's something I should've shown you long ago.

764
01:04:40,330 --> 01:04:43,890
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Is this me?

765
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:49,900
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And this is my father, and,

766
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:52,910
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}and my...

767
01:04:52,950 --> 01:04:55,920
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Now you know.

768
01:04:55,950 --> 01:04:59,910
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Tarzan, I just want you to be happy,

769
01:04:59,950 --> 01:05:03,910
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}whatever you decide.

770
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,010
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No matter where I go,

771
01:05:52,010 --> 01:05:55,010
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}you will always be my mother.

772
01:05:59,010 --> 01:06:02,970
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And you will always be in my heart.

773
01:06:20,530 --> 01:06:23,990
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, good-bye, Tarzan.

774
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:27,740
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Tarzan! I'm so glad you found us in time.

775
01:06:27,740 --> 01:06:30,030
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Let's get in the boat, shall we?

776
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:35,040
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Mustn't keep the captain waiting.

777
01:06:38,050 --> 01:06:40,020
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Tarzan!

778
01:06:40,050 --> 01:06:43,420
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We're too late! I can't believe it!

779
01:06:43,460 --> 01:06:45,360
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}If you'd have pulled over and asked for directions...

780
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:48,030
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We didn't get to say good-bye.

781
01:06:48,060 --> 01:06:51,030
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yeah, well, good riddance! All right? Who needs you? Huh?

782
01:06:51,060 --> 01:06:53,000
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Go on, get out of here, bald boy!

783
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,070
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You ingrate! You bald ingrate!

784
01:06:56,070 --> 01:06:58,340
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Go on and rot, for all I care!

785
01:06:58,340 --> 01:07:00,030
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Go!

786
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:04,080
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What are you looking at?

787
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:07,070
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm gonna miss him, too.

788
01:07:14,790 --> 01:07:17,690
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Tarzan, you can't imagine what's in store for you.

789
01:07:17,690 --> 01:07:19,090
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You're going to see the world.

790
01:07:19,090 --> 01:07:20,690
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Everyone's going to want to meet you.

791
01:07:20,690 --> 01:07:22,760
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Kings, scientists and famous writers.

792
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:26,350
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yes, Darwin and Kipling. Queen Wictoria.

793
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,470
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I haven't met her, but I heard she's awfully nice.

794
01:07:28,470 --> 01:07:32,060
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-And I'll be with Jane? -Mmm. Mmm.

795
01:07:32,110 --> 01:07:36,060
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yes, with Jane.

796
01:07:36,110 --> 01:07:40,070
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ooh! Slippery.

797
01:07:59,430 --> 01:08:00,600
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Tarzan!

798
01:08:01,730 --> 01:08:03,100
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Tarzan!

799
01:08:03,140 --> 01:08:04,100
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Get him!

800
01:08:09,990 --> 01:08:12,500
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-Tarzan! -Jane!

801
01:08:33,170 --> 01:08:35,170
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What's going on here?

802
01:08:35,170 --> 01:08:37,170
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Clayton. Clayton, help.

803
01:08:39,170 --> 01:08:41,130
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Have we met?

804
01:08:44,180 --> 01:08:46,150
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ah, yes.

805
01:08:46,180 --> 01:08:48,150
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The ape man.

806
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:52,440
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Clayton, you... you...

807
01:08:53,990 --> 01:08:56,700
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So sorry about the rude welcome, old boy.

808
01:08:56,700 --> 01:08:58,990
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But I couldn't have you making a scene,

809
01:08:58,990 --> 01:09:03,000
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}when we put your furry friends in their cages.

810
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,150
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-Why? -Why?

811
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:09,170
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}For 300 pounds sterling a head.

812
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:12,570
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Actually, I have you to thank, my boy.

813
01:09:12,610 --> 01:09:16,160
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Couldn't have done it without you.

814
01:09:17,810 --> 01:09:21,170
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Lock him up with the others.

815
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:26,490
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Uh, that sounded like Tarzan.

816
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:28,620
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He sounded like, like he was in trouble.

817
01:09:28,620 --> 01:09:31,800
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yeah, well, why doesn't he get his new friends to help him?

818
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:32,800
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I don't care.

819
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:35,890
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That's it!

820
01:09:35,890 --> 01:09:39,100
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I've had it with you and your emotional constipation!

821
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:42,300
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Tarzan needs us, and we're gonna help him!

822
01:09:42,340 --> 01:09:46,290
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You got that? Now, pipe down and hang on tight.

823
01:09:46,340 --> 01:09:48,610
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We've got a boat to catch.

824
01:09:57,950 --> 01:10:00,320
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I've never felt so alive!

825
01:10:00,950 --> 01:10:03,320
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Good! Because I'm gonna kill you!

826
01:10:03,660 --> 01:10:07,320
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No time for that now, missy.

827
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,350
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Tarzan, it's no use. Don't!

828
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,650
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-Clayton. -Yes, Clayton.

829
01:10:39,690 --> 01:10:41,360
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Clayton betrayed us all.

830
01:10:41,390 --> 01:10:45,050
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-I'm so sorry, Tarzan. -No.

831
01:10:45,050 --> 01:10:49,360
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I did this. I betrayed my family.

832
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:51,370
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Kerchak was right.

833
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:55,860
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, those magnificent creatures, shivering in cages!

834
01:10:56,410 --> 01:10:58,780
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What is this world coming to?

835
01:11:04,420 --> 01:11:07,390
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, by jove, don't know my own strength.

836
01:11:12,430 --> 01:11:13,790
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What was that?

837
01:11:13,790 --> 01:11:16,400
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You are an animal!

838
01:11:18,430 --> 01:11:20,690
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That sounded just like an elephant.

839
01:11:20,690 --> 01:11:22,000
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Tantor!

840
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:25,000
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Thanks, guys.

841
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:29,430
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I thought I would never see you again, and here you are!

842
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:33,400
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sometimes you embarrass me.

843
01:12:40,510 --> 01:12:44,470
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ah, I remember you.

844
01:12:45,220 --> 01:12:48,800
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I think this one will be better off stuffed.

845
01:13:02,540 --> 01:13:05,500
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Charge!

846
01:13:09,540 --> 01:13:13,500
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-You came back. -I came home.

847
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,000
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Fire!

848
01:13:35,570 --> 01:13:39,530
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You there! Take what you can back to the boat!

849
01:13:42,580 --> 01:13:45,000
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I've got some hunting to do.

850
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:10,570
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Don't worry.

851
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:12,570
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm going to have you out of this in a second.

852
01:14:17,010 --> 01:14:20,570
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Right. This should do the trick.

853
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:44,600
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hiding, are we?

854
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:46,610
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-Go on! -Clayton, you...

855
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:48,640
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I could use a challenge

856
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:50,640
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}because after I get rid of you,

857
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:55,880
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}rounding up your little ape family will be all too easy!

858
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:24,500
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Go ahead, shoot me.

859
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:31,640
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Be a man.

860
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:39,650
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Not a man like you!

861
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:11,600
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Clayton!

862
01:16:12,730 --> 01:16:15,690
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Clayton, don't!

863
01:17:05,780 --> 01:17:07,750
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Tarzan.

864
01:17:07,780 --> 01:17:11,740
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Kerchak... forgive me.

865
01:17:12,790 --> 01:17:17,330
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No. Forgive me for not understanding...

866
01:17:17,990 --> 01:17:22,250
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}that you have always been one of us.

867
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:27,760
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Our family will look to you now.

868
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:31,470
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No, Kerchak.

869
01:17:31,470 --> 01:17:34,760
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Take care of them,

870
01:17:34,810 --> 01:17:38,770
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}my son.

871
01:17:45,420 --> 01:17:48,780
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Take care of them.

872
01:19:07,900 --> 01:19:11,860
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}London will seem so small compared to all this.

873
01:19:12,910 --> 01:19:14,870
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I will miss you, Jane.

874
01:19:14,910 --> 01:19:18,870
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-Miss Porter! -I, I know. I'm coming.

875
01:19:19,510 --> 01:19:25,870
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, I suppose we should say good-bye.

876
01:19:36,930 --> 01:19:37,900
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Good-bye.

877
01:19:46,940 --> 01:19:50,900
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Good-bye, Tarzan! Good-bye.

878
01:19:50,940 --> 01:19:54,900
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, I'm going to miss that boy.

879
01:20:03,660 --> 01:20:07,700
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Jane, dear, I can't help feeling that you should stay.

880
01:20:07,700 --> 01:20:10,360
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Daddy, please don't. We've been through all of this.

881
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:12,700
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I couldn't possibly st...

882
01:20:12,700 --> 01:20:15,000
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I, I belong in England with you,

883
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,960
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}with people, and... Aah!

884

{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But you love him.

885
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:31,940
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Go on.

886
01:20:56,710 --> 01:21:00,970
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Thank you. Thanks for getting my glove.

887
01:21:01,010 --> 01:21:04,970
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Thank you.

888
01:21:18,030 --> 01:21:22,290
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But, what... what am I doing? Captain?

889
01:21:22,590 --> 01:21:24,400
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Tell them that you never found us.

890
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:28,300
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}After all, people get lost in the jungle every day. Right?

891

{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Tootle-pip!
