1
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:02,720
偷Han的盘子
Stealing Han's dishes,

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,860
这样我们就不用洗在家的盘子 简直是天才
so we don't have to clean our at home is genius.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,260
也有点可悲
And a little sad.

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,200
开什么玩笑 自我今早大姨妈光顾之后
You kidding? This is the greatest thing that's happened to me

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,720
对我来说 这简直是最棒的事了
since I got my period this morning.

6
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,020
Max Caroline 你们在偷我的盘子
Max, Caroline, you're stealing my dishes?

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,120
见鬼 我没想到这个高度你也可以看见
Damn it, I didn't think you could see up this high.

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,920
我也没想到你会这么堕落
And I didn't think you could sink this low.

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,900
好吧 快停下 你们用
Okay, stop, you're already robbing me blind

10
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,680
"我只是一个服务生"这种小把戏顺了很多东西
with your "I'm a waitress" Scam.

11
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,320
抱歉 但是家里现在实在是一团糟
Sorry, but things have gotten kind of messy at home.

12
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:32,380
昨天 我不得不洗个澡
Yesterday, I had to take

13
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,560
就为了洗干净我拿着的喷淋头
a shower to shower off the shower I took.

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,770
你们两个应该雇一个清洁女工
You two should get a cleaning lady.

15
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,060
我就雇了一个女工来收拾我的公寓
I have a woman I pay to clean my apartment.

16
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,440
价钱蛮贵 但是如果你不和她做爱的话
She is expensive, but she may charge you less

17
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:44,300
她可能少收你点
if you don't also have sex on her.

18
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,660
我去问问看吧
I'll look into it.

19
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,280
我的祖母会免费收拾屋子
My grandmother cleaned the house free of charge.

20
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,620
当然 在这件事上 她也没什么发言权了
Of course she didn't have a say in the matter.

21
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,980
我们还是问问Sophie吧 她有清洁服务的公司
Let's just ask Sophie. She has a cleaning service.

22
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,360
我们必须做点什么
We have to do something.

23
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,160
昨天 我看见一只小强从我们公寓跑出来
Yesterday, I saw a roach walk out of our apartment.

24
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,160
听着
Look.

25
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,020
我要把我对那个想用
I'm gonna tell you what I told that guy

26
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,100
我翘臀偷运鸦片的人说的话答你
who asked me to use my butt to smuggle opium.

27
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:17,620
我会做的
I'll do it!

28
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,980

Be ready, Max.

33
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,160
我们要在清洁女工来之前离开这儿
We have to leave as soon as the cleaning lady gets here.

34
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,300
这是她们的潜规矩
It's housekeeper etiquette.

35
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,820
以前 这种时候 我会去上单车班 然后和朋友们吃午餐
In my old life, I go to spin class and lunch with friends,

36
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,720
但是现在我们就只是一起出去
but you and I will just go outside

37
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,680
看看那个刚从监狱出来的家伙
and watch the guy who just

38
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,560
在电线杠子上做做引体向上
got out of jail do pull-ups on the light post.

39
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:51,820
Calvin出狱了
Calvin's out?

40
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,640
我才不走
I'm not gonna leave.

41
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,480
我要看着她把这些脏东西收拾干净
I want to watch her clean up my mess.

42
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,440
没错 小宝贝
Yeah, baby.

43
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,980
我等了一辈子就是为了个仆人
I've waited my whole life to have a servant.

44
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,400
在你刚来的前几周我还幻想着你会是个好仆人
I thought you were gonna be it for the first few weeks

45
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,680
然后我意识到 你什么都不会做
and then I realized you can't do anything.

46
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,020
尽管Sophie给我们折扣了
And even though Sophie gave us a discount,

47
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,000
这个小仆人还是要叫我 女王陛下
the maid still has to call me "Your Highness."

48
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,160
那是因为 我现在已经自嗨起来了
Mostly because I'm pretty "Highness" Right now.

49
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,200
嗨 菇凉们
Hi, girls.

50
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,420
我来了
Here I am.

51
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,720
来自"苏菲的选择清洁服务公司"的Sophie
Sophie from Sophie's Choice Cleaning Service.

52
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,480
认识一下你们的清洁女工吧 Paulina
Meet your cleaning lady Paulina.

53
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,160
Paulina 见见菇凉们
Paulina, meet the girls.

54
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:32,840
嗯
Mm.

55
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,620
她也很想握手 不过她只有一只胳膊
She'd shake hands, but she only has one arm.

56
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,080
Sophie 她能听见你说什么
Sophie, she can hear you.

57
00:02:40,186 --> 00:02:42,021
那又怎样 我知道我只有一只胳膊
So what? I know I'm missing arm.

58
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,260
这也不是什么新鲜事
It's not news.

59
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,690
她丢了一只胳膊
So she lost an arm.

60
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,200
我在楼下垃圾处理场丢了一只金耳环
I lost my gold earring down the garbage disposal

61
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,400
但是我实在是不想下去再找了
but I was too afraid to reach into it

62
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,580
因为 嗯 嗯哼(我可不想也没只胳膊)
because, well, yeah.

63
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,240
不用担心
Don't worry.

64
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,040
虽然我只有一只胳膊 但我的表现好像我有三只一样
I have one arm but I clean like I have three.

65
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,180
我要再补点妆 然后就可以开始了
I put on more makeup, then I start.

66
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,500
不好意思 在叫清洁女工的时候
I'm sorry. I didn't realize when I ordered a cleaning lady

67
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,760
我没意识要说找有两只胳膊的
I had to specify I wanted one with two arms.

68
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,160
你可负担不起两只胳膊
You can't afford two arms.

69
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,000
你说你想要价格优惠点
You said you wanted a good price.

70
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,000
一只胳膊 一半的价格
Half the arms, half the price.

71
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,220
她就是这样丢了她的胳膊的吗 Sophie
Is that how she lost the arm, Sophie?

72
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,060
你把它砍断了 这样就可以给我们个折扣
You cut it off so we could get a discount?

73
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,400
哦 是的 没错
Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah, I

74
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,560
我把她的胳膊锯掉了 这样可以给你们便宜10元钱
sawed off her arm so I could save you 10 bucks.

75
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,660
我先从卧室开始了
I start in bedroom.

76
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,760
等一下 在你开始前 有一个问题
Wait, before you do, one question.

77
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,080
你的胳膊是怎么没了的 和James Franco一样的情况吗
How'd you lose it? James Franco situation?

78
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,780
为了脱困 你必须断掉一只胳膊
You had to cut it off to get loose?

79
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,520
你没有否认
You're not saying no.

80
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,740
好了 不要再谈这个话题了
Oh, you know what, let's not go there.

81
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,020
它发生了 都过去了
You know, it happened, it was in the past.

82
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,840
我被困在了一个大卡车下面
I was trapped under this big truck.

83
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,960
我们都懂了
We get it.

84
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,020
我开车把你胳膊压断了
I drove over your arm.

85
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,900
不要花心思在里面找我上好的珠宝了
Hey, don't even bother looking for my good jewelry in there

86
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,040
因为它们都在这里
because I'm already wearing all of it.

87
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:09,300
哦 我太嫉妒了 因为我没有胳膊 去戴那些廉价的首饰
Oh, I'm jealous I don't have arm to wear cheap jewelry.

88
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,470
Max 我觉得她好可怜 看见了吗 这就是为什么你应该离开的原因
Max, I feel bad for her. See? This is why you leave.

89
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,960
以防她们画着浓妆出现 也没有两只胳膊
In case they show up with too much makeup and not enough arms.

90
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,580
放松 她很坚强 让我想起了年轻时的我
Relax, she's tough. Reminds me of a young me.

91
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,120
我最好赶紧把我的小药片藏起来
Which means I better go hide my pills from her.

92
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,360
Max 她让我害怕
Max, she scares me.

93
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,020
得了 她没有胳膊
Oh, come on, she's armless.

94
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,200
事情进展的顺利吗 需要我帮助吗
Everything okay? You need any help?

95
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,520
我能工作到现在 可没靠着帮助
I didn't get this far in this business by taking help.

96
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,040
快帮帮我 你没看见我只有一只胳膊吗
Help me! Can't you see I got one arm?

97
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,660
没关系
Not gonna be a problem.

98
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,180
我有时会帮助我的女佣
I would occasionally help my maid...

99
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,000
- 你对这个不敢兴趣  - 用力抬起来
- You're not interested. - Lift!

100
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,420
用力 没用的小姑凉 抬起来
Lift, weak girl. Lift.

101
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,120
Max 过来 帮我们把你的床垫抬起来
Max, come here. We need help lifting your mattress.

102
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,640
能过来帮个忙吗
Can you give us a hand?

103
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,520
不 给我放下 放下 别把床垫掀起来
No! Leave it alone! Leave it alone! Don't lift up the mattress!

104
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,380
哟 黄书啊
Ah, porno.

105
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,040
你思想跟这公寓一样的脏
Your mind is as dirty as your apartment!

106
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,860
对 就是黄书 怎么了 有什么大不了的
Yes, it's porn. So what? What's the big deal?

107
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,880
不就是赤身裸体
It's just the body in its natural form,

108
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,380
在摩托车上搔首弄姿嘛
spread-eagle on a motorcycle.

109
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,580
这些人怎么有一种复古风
Why is so much of it from the '80s?

110
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,580
我就喜欢大胡子
I like mustaches, okay?

111
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:26,200
我顺便还拿它来找我爸
And it's multitasking. I'm looking for my father.

112
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,070
别看了 别看了
Stop looking. Stop looking right now.

113
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,700
怎么这么羞射 Porn hub可是你的电脑首页
Why are you suddenly embarrassed? Porn hub is your homepage.

114
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,520
喔 这是个糕点学校的手册
Hey, is this a brochure for pastry school?

115
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,680
你为什么把它藏着
Why are you hiding a pastry school brochure?

116
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,040
你看着才像个糕点学校的手册
Your face is a pastry school brochure!

117
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,340
Max 你对去学做糕点感兴趣真是太好了
Max, it's great you're interested in pastry school.

118
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,580
我不明白你为什么会尴尬
I don't know why you're embarrassed.

119
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,720
你这张脸才叫人尴尬
- Your face is embarrassed!

120
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:53,090
别这样 我真觉得我们可以一起讨论讨论
Come on, I really think that this is something we should talk about.

121
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,800
我们最需要讨论的是你这张脸
Your face is something we should talk about!

122
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,400
你把那吓人女弄疯了
You made the scary one mad.

123
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,280
真够蠢的
That was dumb move.

124
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,540
你这张脸才叫蠢
Your face was a dumb move!

125
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:08,800
Max
Max?

126
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,200
Max 你离家出走后没回来过
Max, you never came home after you stormed out,

127
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,460
所以我把你的制服给带来了
so I brought you your uniform.

128
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,220
Max 你在嘛
Max?

129
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,760
我现在住这儿
I live here now.

130
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,980
这是我的新室友们 扫帚和拖把
My new roommates, the broom and the mop,

131
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,080
他们可不会鬼鬼祟祟地偷看我的东西
don't sneak around looking at my stuff.

132
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,540
这里什么都有
I got everything I need.

133
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,700
威士忌 牙刷还有牙膏
Whiskey, toothbrush, toothpaste.

134
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,760
好吧 也许你的扫把舍友
Well, maybe your new broommate

135
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,420
会在你喝醉的时候让你停下来
will hold back your hair when you drink too much.

136
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,500
看你这样子 也就会在这小时内喝醉
Which, from the looks of it, will be in about an hour.

137
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,900
Max 我们真要好好谈谈这小册子了
Max, we really need to talk about this brochure.

138
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,620
听着 只是因为我有了这个小册子
Look, just because I have a pastry school brochure

139
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:43,137
并不意味着我真的要去那个学校
doesn't mean I'm actually gonna go to pastry school.

140
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,820
就像虽然我有那些黄色杂志
Just like having those porn magazines

141
00:06:44,942 --> 00:06:47,243
但我也不会真的去骑在老虎身上
doesn't mean I'm actually gonna ride around on a tiger

142
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,640
和水手一起干些黄暴动作 当然这也说不准
performing unspeakable acts with sailors, probably.

143
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,020
糕点学校就跟黄书一样
Pastry school is the same as porn.

144
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,380
只是个愚蠢的幻想罢了
It's just a dumb fantasy.

145
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,480
当然不是这样
Pastry school is not like porn.

146
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,180
这小册子里边可没有介绍"羊角拉拉爱爱包"
There is nothing in this brochure about a girl-on-girl croissant.

147
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,860
这牙膏真好喝
That's good toothpaste.

148
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,960
别用酒刷你的牙了 我们待会儿还得上班
Please stop brushing your teeth. We have a shift to do later.

149
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,560
好 我们来谈谈曼哈顿糕点学校
Okay, the Manhattan school of pastry...

150
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,520
你这张脸就是曼哈顿糕点学校
Your face is the Manhattan school of pastry.

151
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,160
它不是 你清楚得很
You know it isn't.

152
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,260
Max 你可以去看看的
Max, you could go here for real.

153
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,830
一年学费只有3000 虽然有些多 但还可行
Tuition is only $3,000 a year. A lot, but doable.

154
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,520
很多 但可行的
"A lot but doable?"

155
00:07:22,605 --> 00:07:26,543
我们是在谈糕点学校 还是在说打烊前胖吃货男
Are we talking about pastry school or fat guy at last call?

156
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,380
我们来了 Max 你的梦想要开始了
Here we are, Max. Your dream starts now.

157
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,140
要到我能成为黑美人鱼生活的地方了
What, the one where I'm a black mermaid?

158
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,460
放松点 我们只是到处转转然后去领个申请表
Would you relax? We're just gonna look around and get an application.

159
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:48,900
看到这些超棒的设备了吗 如果你在这里学习 这些你都可以用
See all that gorgeous equipment you get to use if you went here?

160
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,910
终于你能有个搅拌钵 而不是一直用个挖空了的西瓜
Finally you'd have a mixing bowl that's not a hollowed-out watermelon.

161
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,540
救救我 她正在逼迫我
Can you help me? She's holding me against my will.

162
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,640
只是开个玩笑
She's kidding.

163
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,490
你再这么做 小姐
If you keep this up, young lady,

164
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,940
之后我不会给你买冰激凌的
you are not getting ice cream after.

165
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,620
好啦
Fine!

166
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,960
来吧 这是办公室
Come on, here's the office.

167
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,860
无所谓了 这事要完了吗
Whatever. Are we almost done here?

168
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,940
我上庭时候到了
I got a court date later.

169
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,740
- 你好 - 你好
- Hi. - Hi.

170
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:11,900
你好
Hi.

171
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,060
你好
Hi.

172
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,800
我不太清楚是不是来对了地方
I'm not sure we're in the right place.

173
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:19,760
有谁真清楚吗
Are any of us, really?

174
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,380
我们想要拿一张申请表 能帮帮我们嘛
We'd like an application. Could you help us?

175
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,300
喔 老天 真希望能
Oh, God, I hope so.

176
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,480
我没想到再回来工作的第一天就这么有压力
I wasn't expecting something this high-pressure my first day back.

177
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,580
告诉你们 我之前在精神病院待过
Let's just say I've been under observation at the nuthouse.

178
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,960
好了 申请表
Okay, application.

179
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,240
是为了Max 就是她 你们的小册子很吸引她
It's for Max, here. She was very impressed by your brochure.

180
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,120
喔 糕点学校 很令人激动 不是吗
Oh, pastry school. Exciting, right?

181
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,000
我以前是这里的大厨 然后就不是了
I was a chef here once. And then I wasn't.

182
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,080
喔 看 找到了申请表
Oh, look. Found the application.

183
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,880
噢 真没想到我能处理好
Wow. Really didn't think I was gonna be able to handle that.

184
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,060
Bebe 如果你
Bebe, if you...

185
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,180
喔 你好 早上好
Oh. Bonjour. Good morning.

186
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,810
Nicolas大厨 这两个女孩是来拿申请表的
Chef Nicolas, these girls are here for an application.

187
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,340
别担心 我都弄好了 差点没成 但是我还是做到了
Don't worry, I handled it. Almost didn't, then I did.

188
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,380
干得好 Bebe
Nice work, Bebe.

189
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,900
喔 我听出来了法国腔哦 还真是的
Oh, do I detect a French accent? Oui?

190
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,620
我的老天 简直不忍直视
Oh, my God, I can't watch.

191
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,360
确实是法国人 我是Nicolas Saintcroix
French, indeed. I'm chef Nicolas Saintcroix,

192
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,780
这里的老板兼首席大厨 欢迎光临
owner and head chef. Bienvenue.

193
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,920
我是Caroline Channing
Caroline Channing.

194
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,020
能走了吗
Is it over yet?

195
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,840
这是Max 申请表是给她的
This is Max. The application's for her.

196
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,500
嘿 法国佬 你也吃蜗牛
'Sup, Frenchie? You eat snails?

197
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,360
看起来Bebe忘了还有第二页
It looks like Bebe forgot the second page.

198
00:09:41,429 --> 00:09:44,297
喔天哪 忘记有第二页了 这可不妙
Oh, boy, forgot the second page. That's not good.

199
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,120
我觉得我处理好了 可是我并没有
I thought I handled it. Didn't handle it.

200
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,930
没事儿的Bebe  吸气
It's okay, Bebe. Breathe in.

201
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:50,840
呼气
Breathe out.

202
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,520
真管用
That's good stuff.

203
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,620
她以前很棒
She was quite brilliant.

204
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,140
然后就傻了
Then she wasn't.

205
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,920
给 把它填了 接下来还有个糕点考试
Here. Fill that out. And the next step is the pastry exam.

206
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,110
申请者要做个传统的果馅饼
Applicants will have to make a classic tart,

207
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,080
明天带来让我试吃一下
bring them in tomorrow for me to taste,

208
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,240
然后就开始学习 怎么样
and we will go from there. Sound good?

209
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,560
随便啦 也许我会考虑一下
Whatever. Maybe I'll think about it.

210
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:17,240
好吧 也许吧 很高兴见到你们
Okay, well, maybe you will. Nice meeting you both.

211
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,820
大厨 希望明天见到你
Hope to see you tomorrow, chef.

212
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,000
他叫我大厨
He called me chef!

213
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,280
- 耶 我们去吃冰激凌  - 不
- Yay! Let's go get ice cream! - No!

214
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:33,040
你该开始做果馅饼 明天就要交了
You should get started on that tart. It's due tomorrow.

215
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,520
我时间多得是 而且有压力才弄得好
I got plenty of time. Besides, pressure ups my game.

216
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,300
当有把枪顶在我脑门上的时候 我最有表现
I perform my best when there's a gun to my head.

217
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,520
随便找个前男友问问都行
Ask any of my ex-boyfriends.

218
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,750
我绝不这么准备考试
This is so not how I prepare for tests.

219
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,080
我以前为了子宫颈抹片检查都温习了三个星期
I studied three weeks for a pap smear.

220
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,860
别担心 我有把握
Don't worry, I got this.

221
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,420
果馅饼就是把布丁倒到饼干上 对吧
A tart's just like a cookie with some pudding on it, right?

222
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,380
Max 这儿怎么了
Max, what is going on in here?

223
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,100
原来果馅饼不仅仅是把布丁放在饼干上这么简单
Turns out a tart's more than a cookie with some pudding on it!

224
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:14,540
你已经在厨房呆了六个小时了 你说过你有把握
You've been in here six hours. You said you had this.

225
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,420
我本也是这么想的 结果并不是这样
I thought I had this! Turns out I don't!

226
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,190
我连个饼底都没弄好
I haven't even finished a shell.

227
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,300
我都不知道竟然还有个饼底 你知道吗
I didn't know there was a shell. Did you know there was a shell?

228
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,960
是人都知道有饼底
Everybody knows there's a shell!

229
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,780
你又抽什么风
What the shell is wrong with you?

230
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,460
我是个不会做果馅饼的贱女
I'm a tart who can't make a tart!

231
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,920
你用的时间都可以做九个饼底了
You could've made nine shells by now.

232
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,120
我做了 看 都在这里
I did. They're all in here. Look.

233
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,620
就像个饼底末日
It's like Shell-mageddon!

234
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,200
喔 去他的 这面团反正一会儿也得进垃圾桶
Oh, screw it. This one's gonna be there in a minute.

235
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,180
还是直接扔了吧
Let's just get it over with.

236
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,160
不 你能做到的 这里这里 这个看起来就很不错
No, you can do this. Here. Here. This still looks ready to go.

237
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,680
看我 看我 我真是浪费我这两条胳膊
Look at me. Look at me. I'm a waste of two arms.

238
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,460
我做不出来果馅饼
I can't make a tart!

239
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:54,260
果馅饼做的怎么样了
How's the tart coming?

240
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,860
Han 别没事儿找事儿 赶紧走
Han, you're not safe. Leave.

241
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:02,280
你连饼底都没弄好 这可是最简单的部份
You haven't even finished the shell? That's the easiest part!

242
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,180
Han 再废话这就是你那张脸的下场
Han, this is your face.

243
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,600
好吧 我该走了
Well, I should get going.

244
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:11,400
她的贱竟还能有突破
I didn't know she could take bitch to the next level.

245
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,700
我完了
I am so screwed!

246
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,460
终于遇到连甩胸也解决不了的问题了
I finally found a situation my boobs can't get me out of!了

247
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:26,480
Max 我对你有一百二十个信心
Hey, Max. Now, I have all the faith in the world in you.

248
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,200
但还是在超市买了个果馅饼给你
But here's a tart from Stop

249
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,110
以防你想交上这个代替
'n Shop in case you wanted to hand this one in.

250
00:12:30,119 --> 00:12:32,856
不 Earl Max不是作弊的人
No, Earl. Max is not a cheater.

251
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,040
还有这种事
Since when?

252
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,760
她要自己做出来个果馅饼
She is going to make her own tart.

253
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,820
你出去吧
You, out.

254
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,640
我根本做不出来饼底
I am never gonna make this shell.

255
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,400
我连怎么放进烤盘里都不会
I can't even get it in the pan right.

256
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,380
Max 好像就是这么放
Max, that looks right.

257
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,480
饿滴神啊 我居然放进盘里了 我绝对能做出来
Oh, my God! I got it in the pan right! I can do this!

258
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,920
我就知道你能做到 我也帮上忙 咱们是闺蜜
You did it! I knew it! I helped you. We're besties.

259
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:52,760
你也欠揍的样 出去
You're not safe. Leave.

260
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,060
这么跟你说 Max
I'm telling you, Max,

261
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,900
我吃饼无数 你的绝对无敌
I've tasted a lot of tarts, and yours is delicious.

262
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,260
很多男人也都这么认为
You are not the first man to tell me that.

263
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,720
第一个这么说的 已经进监狱了
The first man to tell me that is in jail.

264
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,080
他来了 你看你看 他来了
Here he comes. Look at him. Here he comes.

265
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,240
下午好 女士们
Afternoon, ladies.

266
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,380
好个芝士锅啊 埃菲尔铁塔兄
Bien fondue, Eiffel Tower.

267
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,780
好吧
Okay.

268
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,740
感谢你们的到来 让我们开始品尝吧
Thank you for coming. Shall we begin the tasting?

269
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,160
很兴奋吧
This is exciting, huh?

270
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,320
把持住 少女
Keep it in your pants.

271
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,020
来尝果馅饼吧
And now for the tart.

272
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:39,390
这是Max的第一个
It's Max's first ever.

273
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,920
我吃了一小块
I ate a slice earlier and it was like

274
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,240
简直是天堂般美味
Having a little piece of heaven.

275
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,200
别这样 正常点
Don't do anything you're doing.

276
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,380
很薄 浓郁
It's flaky, creamy...

277
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,860
对于你的第一次尝试 相当不错
For a first attempt, I am very impressed.

278
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,160
不算啥 我只做了个果馅饼
Don't be. I made a tart.

279
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,600
又不是治好了疱疹
It's not like I cured herpes

280
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,420
也没发明能为汽水瞬间制冷的神奇微波炉
or invented a reverse microwave to instantly chill sodas.

281
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,000
好的 Max
Okay, Max.

282
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,920
我会和教员们讨论一下 然后告诉你结果
I will talk it over with my faculty and we will let you know.

283
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,180
我会给你个结果
I'll let you know.

284
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,900
搞定
Nailed that.

285
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,100
Max
Max!

286
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:22,120
别偷我的东西了 你已经有清洁工了
Stop stealing my things! You got a cleaning lady!

287
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,660
别紧张 我是来还东西的
Relax. I am returning what I took.

288
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,740
这些是你的盘子
Here's your plates.

289
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,280
还有你的提款卡 我从你钱包里顺的
Oh, and here's your ATM card. I lifted it from your wallet.

290
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,600
对了 还有你的钱包
Oh, and here's your wallet.

291
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,320
里面还应该有40块钱呀
There was $40 in here.

292
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,500
曾经有过
There sure was.

293
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,180
至少把我的丝芙兰购物卡也还回来吧
At least give me back my gift card from Sephora.

294
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,320
Caroline Han想把他的丝芙兰购物卡要回去
Caroline, Han wants his Sephora gift card back.

295
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:47,480
不可能了 我已经买了东西抹脸上了
Oh, that's not happening. It's already on my face.

296
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,900
Max 看 糕点学校的信
Max, look, it's from the pastry school.

297
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,180
哈哈 我的录取信
Whoo-hoo! My acceptance letter!

298
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,200
很多人在厕所里都提起我的JJ
Lot of people talking about my chili in that bathroom.

299
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,110
Oleg 过来 Han Earl 先别走
Oleg, come here. Han, Earl, stay.

300
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,220
你们要欠我个大大的人情了
You guys are about to owe me big.

301
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,200
我要让你们见证最不可能的奇迹了
I am gonna let you witness something extremely rare.

302
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,200
比大脚怪 UFO 或Han的小JJ还要稀有
More rare than a sighting of Bigfoot or a UFO or Han's penis.

303
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,980
你让我过来就是听这个
You held me here so I could hear that?

304
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,640
注意 最稀有的
Behold, the rarest sight of them all.

305
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,740
你们要见证天上真有馅饼掉到我头上了
You are about to see something good actually happen to me.

306
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,720
都听好
Listen to this.

307
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,680
亲爱的Black女士 经过对大批候选人的
"Dear Ms. Black, after careful consideration

308
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,520
慎重考虑 我们很遗憾地通知你
"Of our large pool of applicants, we regret to inform you..."

309
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,260
看来我没被录取
Oh, I guess I didn't get in.

310
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,600
话说回来 我们应该强烈要求她
Looking back, we probably should have insisted

311
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,420
自己先读一读的
she read that to herself, first.

312
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,200
我知道她为什么没被录取 因为她的名字
I know why she didn't get in. Her name.

313
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,680
他们一看Black这个姓 马上就否了
They saw the word "Black" And stopped reading.

314
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,540
这就是我没去成法学院的原因
That's why I didn't get into law school.

315
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:51,860
反正我也没申请
I also didn't apply.

316
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,300
太糟糕了 我去看看她怎么样了
This is terrible. I'm gonna go see if she's okay.

317
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,820
那个法国佬以为他是谁
Who does that French frog think he is?

318
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,960
他以为他尝过我的果馅饼
He thinks he can have the time of his life tasting my tart

319
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,220
就能抹嘴开溜吗
and then never see me again?

320
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,880
他居然不让我入学
He won't let me into his school?

321
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,120
我可不接受被拒
Well, I won't take no for an answer.

322
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,660
我现在就过去
I am going down there right now

323
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,160
拚个你死我活
and giving him a piece of my mind.

324
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,420
老娘冲出去了
I am storming out.

325
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,200
老娘又回来了
And I am storming back in.

326
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,260
天已经晚了 学校早关门了
It is dark outside. That school's not open.

327
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,840
你 嘲笑果馅饼的 我要和你谈谈
Hey, you. Tart tease, we need a word.

328
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,520
天啊
Oh, boy.

329
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,700
怎么 你喜欢我的糕点
What? You love my pastries

330
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,400
却要遗憾地通知我不够资格入学
and then regret to inform me I'm not good enough for your school?

331
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,700
现在我是很遗憾地通知你 我太够格
Well, I regret to inform you that I am good enough

332
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,320
还想知道为什么你不收我入学
and I want to know why you won't let me in here.

333
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:42,440
一听你的声音我就焦虑
Okay, uh, your voice is an anxiety trigger for me.

334
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,100
我要挪出去
I'm going to have to remove

335
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,540
坐到走廊那
myself from the situation and go sit in the hallway.

336
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,000
你能过来陪我吗 你看起来很冷静
Can you come with me? You have a very calming presence.

337
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,860
谢谢 几乎没人这么看我
Thank you. So few people think that about me.

338
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,280
但我要和Max一起
But I should stay with Max.

339
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,060
不 我能搞定 你把她带走吧
No, I got this handled. You can have her.

340
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,380
以后不准你随便把我给出去了
This is the last time you give me to someone.

341
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,820
Max 你的果馅饼非常出色 问题在于你的态度
Max, your tart was excellent. The problem was your attitude.

342
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,160
你没有表现出想要入学的热情
You showed no passion of wanting to be in this school.

343
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,580
所以你才没被录取
And that is why you didn't get in.

344
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,220
你好像根本不在乎
It seemed like you didn't want it.

345
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,040
不 不 不 我的态度是这样而已
No, no, no, that's just my attitude.

346
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,620
我装作我什么都不想要
I act like I don't want

347
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,750
是因为我从来没得到过我想要的东西
anything because I never got anything I wanted.

348
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,000
但是我从来都没有
But I do want to go to this

349
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,000
这么渴望要进入这学校
school more than I've ever wanted anything.

350
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,100
这是我的理想 是我的梦想
It's my fantasy and my dream,

351
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,320
你他喵别逼我说些恶心 玛丽苏的话的话好吗
and please stop making me use these horrible, horrible words!

352
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,260
就收我进来 好吗
Just let me in, okay?

353
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,380
好吧
Okay.

354
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:42,880
神马 真的么
Wait, for real?

355
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,850
没错 我想看看你的热情是不是跟你的手艺一样感动人
Yes. I needed to see if your passion was as good as your pastry

356
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,660
而你刚刚已经证明给我看了
and you just showed me it was.

357
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,940
很高兴你来到我们学校 大厨
I'm thrilled to have you on board, chef.

358
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,600
谢了 大厨
Thanks, chef.

359
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,800
Bebe恐慌症发作了 她要捉着她的柠檬
Bebe is having a panic attack and needs to hold her lemon.

360
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,100
有人见到过她的柠檬吗
Has anyone seen her lemon?

361
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,940
Caroline 他收了我了 我要去糕点学校了
Caroline, he let me in. I'm going to pastry school.

362
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,730
现在你们都得叫姐做"大厨"了
Everybody has to call me "Chef" Now!

363
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,300
你做到了 大厨
You did it, chef!

364
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,510
你要去小册子上介绍的糕点学校上学了
You're going to the pastry school from the brochure!

365
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,240
还不快感谢我翻了你的黄书
Aren't you glad I looked at your porn?

366
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:18,280
我们是室友 都是单身的 没想到吧
We're roommates. Both single. Quelle surprise.

367
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,640
那Max 你填好这些表格 你就是正式录取了
So Max, once you fill out these, you will be officially enrolled.

368
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,380
还有就是要交学费
And of course we will need your tuition check.

369
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:29,860
嗯哼 3000刀 对我们来说挺多的
Yup. $3,000. It's a lot for us.

370
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,320
不过我们会再省钱的 厕纸只用半层
But if we make some cutbacks, 1/2-ply toilet paper.

371
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:35,180
我特么在逗谁呢 厕纸 餐巾也不用了
Who am I kidding? No toilet paper, diner napkins.

372
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:39,320
慢着 学费是24000刀
No, tuition is 24,000.

373
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,580
不过小册子上写的是3000刀一年啊
But the brochure said $3,000 a year.

374
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,340
你看错了 是3000刀一门课
You misread it. It's $3,000 a unit.

375
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,280
一年有8门课 一共24000
There is eight units per year. 24,000.

376
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:53,260
要24000刀 我们可没那钱
It costs $24,000? We can't pay that.

377
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,500
噢 天啊 我这辈子都不可能来这上课
Oh, my God, now I'm never gonna be able to come here

378
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,920
老娘刚刚才认了我想来
and I just admitted I wanted to!

379
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:00,320
我说过我要什么的话我都收回来
I take back everything I ever said about wanting anything.

380
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,180
Max 你不能就这样一走了之
Max, you can't just storm out.

381
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,440
你的脸才不能一走了之
Your face can't just storm out!

382
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,320
听着 为了让她能来这上课我什么都愿意干
Look, I will do anything for that girl to go to this school.

383
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,830
我可以在这办公室打工 来帮忙付学费
In exchange for tuition, I could work in the office.

384
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,100
Bebe很明显要人来帮忙分担压力
Bebe clearly needs someone to help take the pressure off

385
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,760
又有谁比我这个心理正常
and who better than a mentally stable

386
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,180
的沃顿毕业生更合适呢
Wharton graduate like myself?

387
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:20,360
不过我什么都能做 帮你洗地板都行好吗
But I'll do anything. I'll even wash your floors, okay?

388
00:19:20,582 --> 00:19:22,332
虽然我真的不是很想做这个
Although I'm sure there's something better than that.

389
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,280
不过你要我洗地板的话 我马上去洗
But if you need me to wash the floors, I will wash the floors.

390
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,320
虽然我更想做其他的事代替
Really would prefer to do anything else,

391
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,200
不过我还是会洗的 因为
but I'll do it, 'cause

392
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,180
为了让她能来这上课我在所不惜
I'll do anything to get her into this school.

393
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,020
求你别让我洗地板
Please no floors.

394
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,500
好吧 我跟我同事谈谈 然后再通知你吧
Okay, I will talk it over with my staff and I will let you know.

395

when you give people the "I'll let you know."

就是 我所有的梦想
You know, all my fantasies.

404
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:09,800
生活教会了我一件事
If I learned anything in life

405
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,160

你不用谢我
You don't have to thank me.

419
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,360
因为等我学成了

skills I'm gonna use you like Kim uses Kanye.

421
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:54,440
又或者侃爷利用卡戴珊 不知道他们谁占的便宜多点
Or Kanye uses Kim. I'm not sure which of them is winning.

422
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,280
你给我安排的这勤工俭学是怎样的
What kind of work-study arrangement did you make for me?

423
