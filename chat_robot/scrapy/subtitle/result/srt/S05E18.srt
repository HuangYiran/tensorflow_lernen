你看起来有点...  迷茫
You just seem a little... confused.

没事
It's okay--

17
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,230

No, really. I mean, I'll radio rodney, I'll just--

18
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:22,060
不不  你不需要那样做
No, no, you don't need to do that.

19
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,760
那好  你躺下吧
Better yet, let-- why don't you lie down?

20
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,700
跟我去医务室吧
Walk with me to the infirmary,

21
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,860
帮你检查检查
And they'll examine you,

22
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,860

00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,500
你在这啊  我到处找你呢
There you are! I've been looking all over for you.

25
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,690

Is your radio not working? I called, like, 1,000 times!

26
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,200

大概是没电了
It was probably just a dead battery.

We've got to hurry, though, 'cause it's going fast.

33
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,060
怎么了
So what happened?

34
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,100
什么意思
What do you mean?

35
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,430
我们约了一起吃午餐啊
Well, hello? our lunch date?

36

你半个小时前
You were supposed to meet me, like,

就该来找我了
Half an hour ago.

我大概忘了
I must have forgotten.

39
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,660
怎么了
Hey. what's wrong?

40
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,230
你看起来心不在焉的
You seem distracted.

41
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,790
有什么事么
Is something bothering you?

42
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,160
我做了什么
Did I do something?

43
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,030
肯定是我做了什么
Oh... I did, didn't i? what'd I do?

It's for you.

49
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,430

Working fine, apparently.

50
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,000

53

Dr. zelenka?

54
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,000
泽兰卡怎么了
What's wrong with zelenka?

55
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,330
他还在抱怨
Is he complaining about

56
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,690
所谓的偏头痛么
Another one of his so-called migraines?

57
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,130
如果是的话  你就直接把他打发到...
'cause, if he is, you can just send him right down to the--

58
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,830
他被人刺伤了
He's been stabbed!

59
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,600
什么  刺伤  什么意思

60
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,000
被刀子刺伤了?
Like, with a knife, stabbed?

61
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,330
谁刺的
By whom?

62
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:12,630
不知道  我们刚刚接到通知

没事  我去准备了
Nothing. I need to get ready.

84

我不舒服
I'm not feeling very well.

我要去躺一下
I'm going to go lie down.

88
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,160
怎么了
How'd it go?

89
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,500
他们已经止住流血

但他流了很多血

轻度昏迷
It's a light coma.

94
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,200
他们认为他会好的
They figure he should recover,

95
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,230
但不能防止并发症
Barring any, you know, complications.

96
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,560
听说不是凯勒医生主刀
I hear dr. keller didn't perform the surgery?

97
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,760
是的  她找借口离开了
No. no, she... excused herself.

98
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,060
她说她不舒服
She said she wasn't feeling well.

99
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:10,900
她怎么了
What's wrong with her?

100
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:11,960
不知道
You tell me.

101
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,160
她今天很奇怪
I mean, she's been acting strange all day.

102
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,560
太虚神游  心不在焉
Aloof, distracted.

103
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,330
我看见她在城里乱逛  好像迷路了
I found her wandering atlantis, looking lost.

104
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,500
然后我带她到医护室
Then I got her to the infirmary,

105
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,560
但她只是站在那
But she just stood there

106
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,730
好像从没用过手术刀
Like she'd never held a scalpel before.

107
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,060
她现在在哪
Where is she now?

108

在她寝室  休息
In her quarters, resting.

贝克特博士马上要回来了

I'll have him examine her for any possible contagion,

111
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,830
或者  别的什么寄生生物
Or, god forbid, another one of those parasitic organisms.

112
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:35,200
以防万一
Better safe than sorry.

113
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,660
有线索么  谁会对泽兰卡博士下此毒手
Any leads yet as to who might have done this to dr. zelenka?

114
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,360
没有目击者  没有挣扎的迹象
No witnesses, no sign of struggle.

115
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,100
我要全面调查

116
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,960
充分利用资源  全力以赴
Use every resource, no stone unturned.

117
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,260
我们的人昏迷了
One of our people is lying in a coma--

118
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,430
轻度昏迷
Light coma.

119
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:52,960
我要知道谁该负责任
...and I want to know who's responsible.

120
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,960
到底怎么了
What the hell's going on here?

121
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,060
听说你不舒服
Heard you weren't feeling well.

122
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,760
没
No.

我只是  很累
I'm just... tired.

128
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:50,100
你给自己太大压力了
Been pushing yourself real hard lately.

129
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,160
是的
Yes...

130
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,560
你知道的

131
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,130
我总是给自己很大压力
I'm always pushing myself real hard.

132
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,560

00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,660
没什么
Nothing.

146
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:31,760
小飞船
A puddle jumper?

147
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,000
他在某个偏僻荒凉的村里
Well, he's in some remote desert village,

148
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,690
离星门十万八千里
And it'll take too long to walk back to the gate,

149
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:38,030
所以得搭个顺风车
So, it's easier to, you know, hitch a ride.

150
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:41,160
顺风飞船
A ride on a puddle jumper.

151
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,690
没错
Yeah.

152
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,660
也许我们该走了吧
Maybe we should leave,

153
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,830
让她好好歇歇
You know, let her get some rest?

154
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,000
好
Yeah.

155
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,130
有什么需要  通知我
Call me... if you need anything.

156
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:09,130
我会的
I will.

157
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,460
没什么反常的
Nothing out of the usual,

158
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,830
没外伤  没被寄生
No sign of trauma or any kind of organism.

159
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,200
血液循环呢
What about her blood work?

160
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,960
正常
The same.

161
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,300
你这样多久了
How long have you been feeling like this?

162
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:42,260
一天左右吧
Um... a day or so?

163
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,460
你睡得好么
Have you been sleeping all right?

164
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,860
不好  我给自己太大压力了
No. I've been pushing myself real hard.

165
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,430
今晚你最好待在这儿
Aye. well, I'd like to keep you overnight

166
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,600
以便观察
For observation.

167
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,300
吃点帮助睡眠药
I'll give you something to help you sleep,

168
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,630
我会监控你的状况
And we'll monitor your condition.

169
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,830
顺利的话
Then, hopefully,

170
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,460
你明早醒来就没事了
You'll wake up in the morning refreshed,

171
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,430
和以前一样  好么
Back to your old self. okay?

172
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,230
你真的什么都没发现
You're certain you saw nothing at all?

173
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,790
她没事
She's fine...

174
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:06,100
生理上没事
Physically speaking.

175
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,830
要说她有什么问题的话
If there's something wrong with her,

176
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,430
问题最有可能
I'm afraid it's most likely

177
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:13,760
出在心理上
Psychological in nature.

178
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:47,730
你好
Hello...

179
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:49,000
这些走廊
All these corridors,

180
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,400
搞的我晕头转向
I keep getting turned around.

181
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,930
小飞船在哪儿
The puddle jumper is... where?

182
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:52,930
飞船停泊舱
The jumper bay?

183
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:53,930
对
Yes.

184
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:55,100
中心塔顶层
Top of the central tower.

185
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,790
对  没错  我知道
Right. yeah, I know that.

186
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,330
我只是需要  我怎么...
I just need to, um-- how do i...?

187
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:00,260
传送器在走廊的末端
Oh, the transporter's at the end of the corridor.

188
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,730
它会载你过去
It'll take you there.

189
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,400
传送器  当然  谢谢
Transporter. of course. thank you.

190
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,830
不客气
You're welcome.

191
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:27,730
太好了
Ah... perfect.

192
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,200
快  快  快
Come on, come on. come on.

193
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:47,530
你在干什么
What are you doing?

194
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,300
我  睡不着
I... couldn't sleep.

195
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,900
什么  所以你就到停泊舱来了?
What, so you came up to the jumper bay?

196
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,630
对  我想逛逛
Yeah... I thought I'd go for a ride.

197
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:57,100
在小飞船里
In a puddle jumper?

198
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,730
有问题么
Is there a problem with that?

199
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,660
有点  首先你没有古人基因
A few. for starters, you don't have the ancient gene,

200
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,660
你不能驾驶它
So you can't fly one.

201
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,660
但是这你知道啊
But you already know that.

202
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,130
那你能驾驶么
Can you fly it?

203
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,530
当然  但这不是重点
Of course I can, but that's not the point.

204
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:06,560
听着  你该回医务室
Look, you should be back in the infirmary.

205
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,260
但你能带我去飞一下
But you could take me for a ride.

206
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,330
什么  现在
What, now?

207
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,560
对  帮我放松放松
Yeah. it would really help me relax.

208
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,300
贝克特给你吃过药了吧
Well, I thought beckett gave you pills for that?

209
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,500
没用
They didn't work.

210
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:19,330
来吧  求你了
Yeah. come on. please?

211
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,460
只有你和我
Just you and me.

212
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,660
单独的
Alone...

213
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,860
你可以带我去个僻静的地方
Oh, you could take me somewhere secluded.

214
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,760
我们可以在星空下
We can... we could make love...

215
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,030
做爱
Underneath the stars.

216
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,300
真的
Really?

217
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,900
你不想么
Would you like that?

218
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,400
当然
Well... yeah!

219
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,030
我得去拿毛毯
I mean, I'd have to get a blanket, though,

220
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,160
因为在陆地上
Because the mainland's groundcover

221
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,660
我对很多东西过敏
Is loaded with allergens.

222
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,830
不要  我们现在就走
No. let's just go now.

223
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:41,960
等等等一下  不行
Wait. w-w-wait. no, no, no, no.

224
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,260
听着
Look, you look.

225
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,960
你应该马上回到医务室
You should go back to the infirmary.

226
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,330
忘了医务室吧
Forget about the infirmary.

227
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,760
我想和你在一起
I need to be with you.

228
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,160
珍妮弗  别这样
Jennifer, please.

229
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,130
来嘛  就逛一会儿
Come on. just a quick ride.

230
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,690
难道你不想和我在一起
Don't you want to be with me?

231
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,260
不  当然不是  我只是
No. no! no, I just--

232
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,030
我想  我只是  你能不能停一下
Yes! I just-- will you stop?

233
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,460
我不知道你怎么了
Look, I don't know what's wrong with you,

234
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,830
但显然现在的你不是你自己
But you are clearly not yourself.

235
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,360
我带你回医务室
I'm taking you back to the infirmary--

236
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,630
不
No.

237
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,830
随你怎么吵
Well, you can argue all you want,

238
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:04,330
但我不会让你...
I'm not letting you--

239
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:06,000
我不跟你去任何地方
You're not taking me anywhere.

240
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,660
珍妮弗  听我的
Jennifer... I need you to listen to me.

241
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,600
你一旦痊愈
As soon as you are cured

242
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,960
或者那个影响你的东西没了
Of whatever it is that is affecting you,

243
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,600
你一定会为此感谢我的
You're going to thank me for this,

244
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,260
所以...  我们走
So... let's go.

245
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,560
不  你别...
No! don't you--

246
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,430
你在干什么
What're you doing?

247
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:24,330
你应该带我飞的
You should've taken me on that ride.

248
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,690
我不管扫描结果怎么说
I don't care what the scans say...

249
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:46,160
要么是她遭受了
Either she's suffered

250
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,400
严重的脑部损伤
A serious mind-altering brain trauma,

251
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,690
要么就是有什么东西控制了她
Or some kind of entity has taken control of her.

252
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,030
她最近有受过伤么
Has she been injured recently?

253
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:53,960
据我所知没有
Not that I know of.

254
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,660
昨天为止她一直很好
I mean, she was perfectly fine up until yesterday.

255
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,660
我告诉过你
I'm telling you,

256
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,400
脑部扫描能够显示
Her brain scan would have revealed

257
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,730
任何物理损伤
Any kind of physical trauma,

258
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,500
和各种异体寄生
As well as any foreign organism.

259
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,260
除非那种物质很会捉迷藏
Unless the organism's good at hiding.

260
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,530
是啊  不是第一次了
Yeah. wouldn't be the first time.

261
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:07,260
我们花了几天才发现罗德尼被感染了
It took days to figure out rodney was infected.

262
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,830
我还是觉得我们不能轻易地
I still don't think that we should rule out

263
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:11,330
排除心理创伤的可能
The possibility of a psychological event.

264
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:12,530
有时候我们都忘了
We sometimes forget that working

265
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:14,430
在另一个银河  这样的环境中工作
In this environment, in a whole other galaxy,

266
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:16,330
对人的精神摧残很大
Can be emotionally overwhelming.

267
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,000
这种压力经常会导致
Such acute stress has often been linked

268
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,730
各种各样的机能紊乱
To various dissociative disorders.

269
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:21,200
紊乱  她想杀了我
Disorder? she tried to kill me.

270
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,160
罗德尼  我不认为
Look, rodney, I don't think

271
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,400
她会扣扳机
She would have pulled the trigger.

272
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,730
我看得出她的眼神
Hey, I saw the look in her eyes.

273
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:27,230
她  等等
She-- wait a second.

274
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,690
她会不会和泽兰卡那事有关
What if she had something to do with zelenka?

275
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,360
或许是她刺伤了他
What if she's the one who stabbed him?

276
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,690
凯勒医生
Dr. keller?

277
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:34,100
躺那儿的女人绝不是珍妮弗·凯勒
That woman down there is not jennifer keller.

278
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,930
我觉得伍尔希是对的
I think woolsey's right.

279
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:38,000
有什么东西控制了她
Something has taken control of her.

280
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,530
我们怎么能肯定
How can we be sure of this?

281
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:43,300
我们可以先问问她
Well, we can start by asking her.

282
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:02,060
我们开门见山吧
Let's make this simple.

283
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,460
你到底是谁
Who the hell are you?

284
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,590
什么
What?

285
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:06,560
如果你真是珍妮弗·凯勒
If you are, in fact, jennifer keller,

286
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,960
你就应该知道你从哪个镇来
You would know what town you're from,

287
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,900
你父亲叫什么名字
What your father's name is.

288
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,590
所以  告诉我们吧
So go ahead, tell us.

289
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,360
好吧
All right, look...

290
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,300
我知道我表现得有点奇怪
I know I've been acting strange--

291
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,730
奇怪
Strange?

292
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:20,560
凯勒医生不会拿枪指着我
Dr. keller wouldn't point a gun at me.

293
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,200
也绝不会刺伤泽兰卡
And she certainly wouldn't stab zelenka.

294
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:30,060
你干的  是不是
You did it, didn't you?

295
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,760
你刺伤了他
You stabbed him.

296
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,530
那是自卫
It was self-defense.

297
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:41,160
我不想伤害任何人
I didn't want to hurt anybody,

298
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,030
但他攻击了我
But he attacked me.

299
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:42,760
泽兰卡攻击你
Zelenka attacked you?

300
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,330
他不忍心伤害一只苍蝇
He couldn't harm a fly.

301
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:46,430
他要抓我
He tried to grab me.

302
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,630
我以为他要告发我
I thought he was going to turn me in.

303
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:48,690
我害怕被抓住
I was afraid of being caught.

304
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:49,800
事实就是
The fact of the matter is,

305
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,860
你被抓住了
You have been caught.

306
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,930
所以我建议你
So I would advise you

307
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:54,060
告诉我们你是谁
To tell us exactly who...

308
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,230
或者是什么
Or what you are.

309
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,230
我的名字叫尼娃·卡索尔
My name is neeva casol.

310
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,900
我一点不知道为什么自己会在这里
I have no idea what I'm doing here,

311
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,590
或者说在这个人的身体里
Or how I came to be in this person's body.

312
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,330
在她身体里
In her body?

313
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:16,200
是的  前一秒我还是自己
Yes. one moment I was myself,

314
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,530
在一个村庄里找史前古物
Searching through some artifacts in a village,

315
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:19,960
下一秒
The next moment,

316
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,560
我就跑进这个陌生女人的身体里了
I'm stuck in some strange woman's body,

317
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,660
站在这个城市的中间
Standing in the middle of this city.

318
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,900
每一次我看到
Every time I look

319
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,060
自己的影像  我看到她
At my reflection, I see her...

320
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,460
望着我
Staring back at me.

321
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,860
这怎么可能
How is that even possible?

322
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,730
我也希望知道
I wish I knew.

323
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,300
什么史前古物
What artifacts?

324
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,730
我和同伴
Me and my associates,

325
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,860
我们四处旅行  从一个星球到另一个
We travel around, planet to planet,

326
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:42,060
找一些值钱的东西
Searching for valuables to acquire.

327
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,660
也就是说  偷
Oh, you mean "steal."

328
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,760
我们听说了一个星球
We heard about a planet

329
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,760
很可能有珍贵的古人史前器物...
That supposedly held a trove of ancestral artifacts...

330
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:53,330
所以我们就去了那里  撬开地窖
So we made our way there and broke into the vault...

331
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,260
看见没  我告诉过你
You see? I told you.

332
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:12,930
这里有各种各样的珍宝
There is all kinds of treasure in here.

333
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,400
好了  动作快点
Okay, well, move fast.

334
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,400
只拿我们能搬的
Take only what we can carry.

335
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,330
那是  什么
What... is that?

336
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:28,860
不知道
I don't know.

337
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,100
不过这玩意儿太大搬不出去
But it's too big to haul out of here.

338
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:15,100
我不知道怎么回事  或者说为什么
I have no idea how this happened, or why.

339
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:19,060
相信我  我也莫名其妙
believe me, I'm just as confused by it as you are...

340
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,860
但我说的是事实
But I am telling you the truth.

341
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,690
我很抱歉袭击了你们的人
Look, I'm sorry for hurting one of your people,

342
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:26,360
但我很害怕
But I felt threatened,

343
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,200
碰到这种情况我只知道一种方法
And I only know of one way to deal with a threat.

344
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,930
我不想伤害任何人
I don't want to hurt anybody else.

345
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:35,560
我只想回到自己的身体里
I just... I just want to get back into my own body.

346
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:37,960
有什么发现
What have you got?

347
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,930
我想我大概知道怎么回事了
Well, I think I've figured out what happened.

348
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,560
那个女人说的史前古物
The artifact that woman described

349
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,000
我有印象  所以我做了些调查
It rang a bell, so I did a little research.

350
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,530
然后发现  几年之前
Turns out, a few years ago,

351
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:47,160
星门一队也碰到过类似的仪器
Sg-1 encountered a similar device

352
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,830
在格拉斯顿博里山洞
In the glastonbury cavern.

353
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,560
古人的通讯终端
The ancient communication terminal?

354
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,660
完全正确
Exactly.

355
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,530
当然了  那个石头  那种超自然连接
Of course. the stones, the psychic link--

356
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:56,330
什么终端机  什么石头
What terminal? what stones?

357
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:58,960
星门一队发现了一个古人仪器
ok,look. Sg-1 discovered an ancient device.

358
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,130
那些石头  如果你
These stones-- if you place them

359
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:01,430
把他们放进
In one of several recesses

360
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:02,900
仪器外围的凹陷处
Around the outside of the device,

361
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,500
就会激活它
It activates it,

362
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,960
能够让你联系上很远的人
And allows you to connect to someone far... far away,

363
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,830
能穿越银河  甚至说
Across the galaxy, intergalactically, even,

364
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,630
像丹尼尔·杰克森和娃剌这种情况
As was the case with daniel jackson and vala.

365
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:12,530
所以这女人激活了这种仪器
So this woman activated one of these devices?

366
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:14,060
我觉得是这样
I think so, yes.

367
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,630
那她为什么会连上凯勒
Why'd she connect with keller?

368
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,200
我第一个想问的也是这个
Ah, my first question as well.

369
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,200
然后我想到了杰纳斯的实验室
Then I remembered janus's lab...

370
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,460
在那儿我们修复了
We have recovered tons

371
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,260
大量的古人技术
Of ancient technology from there.

372
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,930
到现在还没编辑完
We're still in the process of cataloguing it all.

373
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,560
几周之前
Anyways, a few weeks ago,

374
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,960
我在那儿工作时珍妮弗来找我
Jennifer visited me while I was working there.

375
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,230
罗德尼  我们不快点走的话
Rodney, if we don't leave soon,

376
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,530
就没有好座位了
We're not going to get a good seat.

377
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:32,760
快好了
Yeah. almost-- almost there.

378
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,960
快点  那可是《007之诺博士》
Come on, it's dr. no!

379
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,400
邦德的第一部片子
The first bond movie.

380
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,730
你不会想
You don't want to get stuck

381
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:37,860
再坐在若楠后面吧
Sitting behind ronon again,

382
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,860
像上个礼拜那样
Like last week.

383
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,200
我知道  我知道
I know, I know, I know.

384
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,160
迟了连爆米花都没了
Not to mention, all the popcorn's gonna be gone.

385
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,360
上帝啊  这个太绝了
God! this is amazing!

386
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,760
设计初稿是关于
These are the initial design concepts

387
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,530
个人隐身装置的
For a personal cloaking device.

388
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:47,360
杰纳斯都没机会完成
Janus never got around to making it,

389
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,760
但要是给我足够时间  我可能...
But I think, given enough time, I might be able--

390
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,260
那些我们还没登记
We haven't cataloged those yet!

391
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,830
对不起
Sorry.

392
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,160
刚刚说到哪儿了
What did we say about that?

393
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,360
这些石头一定是和
These stones must somehow be connected

394
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,690
尼娃发现的古人终端机有关
To the ancient terminal that neeva found.

395
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:03,360
那珍妮弗又是怎么激活它的呢
But how could jennifer activate one of these stones?

396
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,060
他说得对  那是古人技术
He's right, it's ancient technology.

397
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,860
难道不需要古人基因么
Don't you need to have the a.t.a. gene?

398
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,330
可能已经被初始化了
Well, it must've been initialized already.

399
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:10,030
可能杰纳斯N年前就弄过了
Maybe janus did it thousands of years ago,

400
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,530
可能我们发现实验室后
Or maybe a tech initialized it

401
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,130
有技术人员初始化过它
After we discovered the lab.

402
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:14,630
关键是  珍妮弗显然是
Look, the point is that jennifer

403
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:16,300
最后一个碰到它的人
Was obviously the last person to touch this,

404
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,660
所以才会连上她
Which is why it connected to her.

405
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,760
如果我没记错报告的话
If I remember the case report correctly,

406
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,800
要取消这种联系很困难
Disconnecting the device proved difficult.

407
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,960
是的  我看了很多星门控制中心记载的相关资料
Yes. I've been going over the sgc files on that,

408
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,930
关于它怎么工作的  还有很多
And there's still a lot of unanswered questions

409
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:28,260
尚未解答的问题
About how it works.

410
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,560
等一下
Hold on.

411
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,460
如果说这个女人在凯勒的身体里
If this woman's mind is in keller's body,

412
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:35,130
是不是说凯勒在这个女人的身体里
Does that mean keller's mind is in her body?

413
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,100
我不知道
I don't know.

414
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,590
可能  应该说...很可能
Maybe. I mean... probably.

415
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,830
那问题就是
Then the question is...

416
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:43,930
凯勒医生在哪儿
Where is dr. keller?

417
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:55,130
怎么了
What happened?

418
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:57,000
你们联系亚特兰蒂斯了么
Did you contact atlantis?

419
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,030
没有
No.

420
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,530
为什么不
Why not?

421
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:02,360
我决定先联系一些我在其他星球上的
I chose to first contact a few of my trading partners

422
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,500
贸易伙伴
On other planets.

423
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,160
看来你和你的同伙
It appears you and your accomplices

424
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,830
臭名远扬啊
Have made quite the name for yourselves.

425
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:09,590
我告诉过你  我不是你想的那个人
I already told you, I am not who you think I am--

426
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,590
我觉得很幸运
I suppose I should feel fortunate.

427
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,860
你在这儿抢劫
I mean, your crimes elsewhere far exceed

428
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,100
远比不上在别处犯的罪
The mere robbery charges you've been accused of here.

429
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,300
在别的星球上
I've counted no less than five murders

430
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,460
你一人就至少背了五条命案
Committed on other planets by your hand alone.

431
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,900
死在你和你同伙手下的更多
Several more with the aid of your two accomplices.

432
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,630
也许他们暂且逃过一劫
Well, they may have eluded capture so far,

433
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:28,130
但记住我的话  我们会抓住他们的
But mark my words, we will find them.

434
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:29,030
听我说
Listen to me.

435
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:31,530
我是珍妮弗·凯勒医生
My name is dr. jennifer keller.

436
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:34,260
我是亚特兰蒂斯的首席医疗官
I am the chief medical officer from atlantis.

437
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,160
我不知道是怎么回事
I don't know what's going on,

438
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,430
我是怎么跑进这个女人身体里的
Or how my mind ended up in this woman's body,

439
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:41,400
但如果你联系他们  找罗德尼·麦凯博士
But if you contact them, ask for dr. rodney mckay--

440
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,530
据说你也是撒谎高手
You are also said to be a highly effective liar,

441
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,760
胡编乱造
Willing to fabricate any story,

442
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,800
说话不算话
Broker any kind of deal,

443
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,500
千方百计骗得自由
To get yourself free.

444
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,060
放心
Rest assured,

445
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,130
我不会上你当的
I will not fall for your tricks.

446
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,960
作为该村的地方法官
As magistrate of this village,

447
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,730
我将起诉你
I hereby pronounce sentence upon you

448
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:57,860
不仅仅在此星球
For the crimes you've committed,

449
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,360
还有联盟中的其他星球上
Not only on this planet,

450
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,400
所犯下的罪刑
But on all the other planets in the coalition.

451
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,030
明天
Tomorrow,

452
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:05,690
你将被带离牢房
You shall be taken from this cell

453
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:07,230
并处决
And executed.

454
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,260
怎么办
What are the options?

455
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,460
只有一个办法
There's only one option.

456
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,490
去那个星球
We have to go to the planet,

457
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:18,490
找到那个通信终端
Find the communications terminal,

458
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:20,130
关掉
And shut it off.

459
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:21,590
它是在那头被激活的  是最初的传输器
It was activated on that end. it's the initial transmitter.

460
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:22,900
所以只能在源头
The only way to sever the connection

461
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,130
切断连接
Is to shut it down at the source.

462
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:25,900
你有没有想到如何安全的关掉它
And have you figured out how to safely do that?

463
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,060
还不知道
No, not yet.

464
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,260
除非看到那玩意儿
We're not going to know

465
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,630
否则我们不可能知道
Until we get a look at this thing.

466
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:32,160
越快越好
Well, the sooner, the better.

467
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,960
我看了星门一队的报告
I've been studying the sg-1 report.

468
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,000
那个仪器不仅仅连通思想
This device connects beyond merely the psychological.

469
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,590
生理上也是相通的
There's also a physiological connection as well.

470
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:40,760
什么意思
What does that mean?

471
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,030
就是说  如果尼娃的身体死了
It means, should neeva's body be killed,

472
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:47,100
珍妮弗的思想就跟着陪葬了
Jennifer's mind would perish along with her.

473
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,530
我们就得终日与这个...
And we'll be stuck with...

474
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:50,430
霸占着凯勒身体的女人打交道
This other woman in keller's body?

475
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,760
我们得行动了
We need to get moving.

476
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,830
行
Agreed.

477
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,590
知道这个仪器在哪个星球上么
Do we know which planet this device is on?

478
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:56,000
会知道的
We will.

479
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,160
我很乐意带你们去
I would be happy to take you to the planet.

480
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,490
直接去找那个仪器
I'll lead you straight to the device...

481
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:00,830
但有个条件
On one condition.

482
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,960
你没资格提要求
You're in no position to make any demands--

483
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,490
什么要求
What is it?

484
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:05,790
你们切断连接后
When you sever that connection,

485
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:07,960
不许追捕我和我的同伴
You have to agree not to pursue me or my accomplices.

486
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,530
可以
Fine.

487
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:11,490
我还要一艘你们的小飞船
And I want you to give me one of those puddle jumpers.

488
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:13,160
什么  不可能
What? forget it!

489
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,460
我知道你们有很多  绰绰有余
I know how many you have. you have more than enough.

490
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,860
你啥都别想拿
You're not getting anything.

491
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,230
那就武器
Weapons, then.

492
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,300
你带我们去星球  我们就不追捕你
You take us to the planet, we agree not to pursue you.

493
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,300
就这么简单  接不接受
That's it. take it or leave it.

494
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:26,130
好吧好吧  我们走
All right, all right. let's go.

495
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:46,730
哪条路
Which way?

496
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:48,560
走这边
This way.

497
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,590
不远  几个小时的行程
It's not far. a few hours' walk.

498
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:51,590
几个小时
A few hours?

499
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,660
你不早说
You could have told us that before!

500
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,130
没大关系  罗德尼
Wouldn't have made any difference, rodney.

501
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:57,200
飞船又不能进森林
We couldn't get a jumper into this forest.

502
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,760
代达罗斯号在地球上
And the daedalus is back on earth.

503
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,960
是啊  但我可以带些
Yeah, but I could've packed

504
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,930
面包棍  带点水
Some extra power bars, some water,

505
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:05,730
换双软底鞋
Not to mention proper insoles.

506
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:06,730
他真能抱怨
He complains a lot.

507
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:08,030
只要他醒着一向如此
Only when he's awake.

508
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:10,730
他和凯勒医生真的...
Is it true that dr. keller and he are--

509
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:13,730
难以置信吧
Hard to believe, huh?

510
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:16,160
多走路少废话
Yeah, keep walkin'.

511
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:24,860
是时候了
It's time.

512
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:42,130
到了
That's it.

513
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:43,390
那个地窖中有大量史前古物
The vault containing the artifacts

514
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:44,530
就在村子中央
Is near the center of the village,

515
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:45,930
所以我们得轻轻的
So we'll have to be quiet.

516
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:48,300
我们最好别都去
Maybe only a few of us should go in.

517
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,560
而且我需要武器
And I'm going to need a weapon,

518
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,690
以防碰到
In case we run into some--

519
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:52,460
不用  我们不用私闯民宅
No. we're not breaking into the room.

520
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,490
什么
What?

521
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:55,060
去和村民谈
We're going to go talk to these people

522
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,390
向他们寻求帮助
And ask them for help.

523
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:57,130
是啊  他们当然会帮忙
Oh, they're not going to help us.

524
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:58,690
因为我洗劫过他们
I tried to rob them.

525
00:25:58,690 --> 00:25:59,960
他们不认识你
They won't know you.

526
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,790
你现在是珍妮弗·凯勒  记得不
You're in jennifer keller's body, remember?

527
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,160
只要你守口如瓶
If you do not say anything,

528
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,660
就没有问题
It should not be a problem.

529
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,590
行啊  要是她...我被逮着了怎么办
Okay, but what if they've captured her-- me?

530
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:08,030
一旦切断连接
Once we sever the connection,

531
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:10,100
如何阻止他们把我关起来
What's to stop them from keeping me locked up?

532
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,960
没办法
Hmm... nothing.

533
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,000
没办法
Ahh. nothing.

534
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,200
你说我们不能追捕你
You said we couldn't pursue you.

535
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,360
不包括他们
Didn't say anything about them.

536
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,390
你阴我
So you tricked me.

537
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:17,830
安啦
Hey, just take it easy.

538
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,260
除非先告诉我  我的身体在哪儿
I won't let you disarm this device

539
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,390
否则我不会让你们切断连接的
Without first knowing where my body is.

540
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:23,230
你没的选
You don't have a choice.

541
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:24,590
同志们  时光在流逝
We're wasting valuable time here, people.

542
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,660
也许她应该留在这儿
Maybe she should stay here.

543
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:28,660
不  我要去
No. I'll go.

544
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,930
若楠
Ronon?

545
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:31,690
行  我看着她
Yeah, I got her.

546
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,490
出发
Let's go.

547
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:42,790
嗨
Hi.

548
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:44,000
放心  都是自己人
It's okay, we're friends.

549
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,760
我们  我们来自亚特兰蒂斯
We're, uh, we're from atlantis.

550
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,660
我是约翰·谢帕德中校
I'm colonel john sheppard.

551
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,390
你想要什么
What is it you want?

552
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:52,430
我们遇到点麻烦  需要帮忙
Well, we have a problem, and we need some help.

553
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:54,260
听说该村庄藏有
We hear that this village holds

554
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,630
大量古人的史前器物
A number of ancient artifacts,

555
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:56,690
特别是一个通讯终端
Most notably a communication terminal...

556
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:58,490
大大的  圆圆的
About yea-big, round-ish,

557
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:00,330
外圈有凹槽
Grooves along the outside...

558
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:01,860
有么
Yes?

559
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:05,030
你们为什么问起那个仪器
Why do you ask about this device?

560
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,300
就是说有咯  在哪儿
So you have it? where is it?

561
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,660
藏起来了  被严密保护
It's hidden, and well-protected,

562
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,660
你们若想带走它
So if you have any designs on removing it--

563
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,000
没有没有  听着
No, no, no, no, no. look.

564
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,590
我们就想看看
We just want to take a look at it.

565
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,030
我们认为它不小心被激活了
We think it may have become inadvertently activated,

566
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:17,730
而且  给我们造成了
And it's... well, it's causing some problems

567
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:18,960
不小的麻烦
For us on atlantis.

568
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,460
长话短说
Long story short,

569
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:23,300
我们来是为了关掉它  然后走人
We're just going to shut it off, and, well, we'll be on our way.

570
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,460
我们不是来惹事的
We're not here to cause any trouble.

571
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,630
是来寻求帮助的
We'd just like some assistance.

572
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:29,330
我无权帮助你们
I do not have the authority to grant such assistance.

573
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:32,300
你们得找村庄的地方法官谈谈
For that, you will need to speak to the village magistrate.

574
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,900
好吧  我们找他谈
All right. let's, uh, let's talk to him.

575
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:35,730
他不在
He's not here.

576
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:36,900
上帝啊
Oh, for god's sake.

577
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,100
他要去多久  这事儿很急
How long's he going to be gone? this is urgent.

578
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,730
死刑结束后他会回来的
He will return when the execution is completed.

579
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,230
我的天
Oh, my god!

580
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:07,200
尼娃·卡索尔
Neeva casol...

581
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,760
你因犯谋杀罪被起诉
You have been found guilty of the crime of murder,

582
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,690
并被处以死刑
And so you shall be put to death.

583
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:15,300
我不是尼娃·卡索尔
I am not neeva casol!

584
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:26,330
别担心
Don't worry.

585
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:29,690
刽子手很壮  刀刃很锋利
The executioner is strong, his blade sharp.

586
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:32,030
你痛苦远比不上
Your death will be far less painful

587
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:34,300
死在你手上的人
Than those of your victims.

588
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,530
别  别这样
Please... please! don't do this!

589
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,390
有埋伏
Ambush!

590
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,360
怎么
What?

591
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,260
连个谢字都没有
No thank-you for the rescue?

592
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,260
我们走
Let's go.

593
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:50,030
她朝那边跑了
She went that way!

594
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,400
快找
Find her!

595
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:55,700
去村子里再找点人
Go back to the village, gather more men.

596
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:58,700
看好祖传的戒指
I want that ancestral ring guarded!

597
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:02,360
不许任何人离开星球
No one leaves this planet!

598
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,900
真不敢相信  她怎么逃的
I don't believe this. how did she escape?

599
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,900
当然是拜我的同伴所赐
My accomplices no doubt intervened.

600
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,000
这种情况不是第一次了
This is not the first time we've been in this situation.

601
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,260
你有几个同伴
How many accomplices do you have?

602
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,100
两个
Two.

603
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,330
就两个
That's all?

604
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:19,300
足够了  相信我
More than enough. trust me.

605
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,730
你斗不过他们
You don't want to challenge them.

606
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:22,400
是么  走着瞧
Yeah? we'll see about that.

607
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,000
他们会去哪儿
Where would they have gone?

608
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
不知道
I have no idea.

609
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,260
好了  开始跟踪
All right, chewie. start trackin'.

610
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,400
这就来
Yeah. I'm on it.

611
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,530
你刚刚吓坏了
You looked frightened out there.

612
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:44,030
你认为我们会弃你于不顾
What, you didn't think we'd save you?

613
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:45,430
什么  没有  只是
What, that-- no, I just...

614
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:47,600
你救了我们那么多次
After how many times you saved our hides?

615
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,660
我们不会让你失望的
We weren't going to let you down.

616
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,860
你没事吧
You all right?

617
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:56,000
你有点迷茫
You look confused.

618
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,630
没有  我只是
No, I'm just...

619
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:00,600
得救很高兴
You know, happy to be out of there.

620
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,700
计划是什么
So, what's the plan?

621
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,300
计划
Plan?

622
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,430
是啊
Yeah.

623
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,600
我们现在怎么办
What do we do now?

624
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,860
我不知道
Uh... I don't know.

625
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,460
目前  还不知道
Yet. yet-- I don't know yet.

626
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,960
我  我需要
I-- I just need, um...

627
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,860
更多时间想
More time to think.

628
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,800
那快想
Well, think faster.

629
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,300
村民迟早会
Because, sooner or later,

630
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,500
发现这个山洞的
Those villagers are going to find this cave.

631
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,460
我可不想坐以待毙
And I don't want to be here when they do.

632
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:29,360
当然
Right.

633
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,900
有道理
Good point.

634
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,900
这边
This way.

635
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,100
十分钟内第三次搜察
That's the third patrol in the last 10 minutes.

636
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,430
看来整个村子都在找她
It seems as if the entire village is out looking for her.

637
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:55,760
希望我们能抢先一步
Let's hope we find her before they do.

638
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:23,130
到底怎么回事
What the hell happened?

639
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:25,260
跟丢了
I lost her.

640
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,830
没有踪迹
Are there no tracks?

641
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:30,030
什么都没有
There's nothing.

642
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:31,700
她很在行
She's good.

643
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:35,530
听着  我认为我们最好
Listen, I think the best plan of action

644
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:37,500
离开这个星球
Is to leave this planet.

645
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,860
我知道另一个星球
Now, I know of another planet.

646
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,160
很安全
We'll be safe there.

647
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,460
戒指会有人把守
They'll be guarding the ring.

648
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,900
我知道
I know.

649
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:46,930
也许可以来点别的
Maybe we could create some kind of diversion?

650
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:50,730
那要怎么做
Well, how do we do that?

651
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:53,660
我不知道
I don't know. um...

652
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,900
或许
Maybe...

653
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:57,830
可以弄个炸弹
Maybe we can set an explosion.

654
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:00,260
他们会朝炸弹跑么
And why would they run toward an explosion?

655
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,930
或者别的什么
Or something else.

656
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,860
我说等到傍晚
I say we wait till nightfall...

657
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:10,500
便偷袭戒指
...then we'll launch an attack on the ring.

658
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,100
出其不意
Catch them by surprise.

659
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,400
偷袭
Uh, an attack?

660
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,630
杀了守卫
We'll kill the guards,

661
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:18,060
激活戒指  然后跑路
Activate the ring, and we make our escape.

662
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:19,960
我同意
I agree.

663
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,730
好吧
Okay. uh...

664
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:24,100
但我突然想到什么
But if I think of something else before then,

665
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,160
或许可以
Maybe we could--

666
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,260
好吧  别开枪
All right, don't shoot.

667
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:37,260
你  是  谁
Who... are... you?

668
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,930
我是  尼娃·卡索尔
I'm... neeva casol.

669
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,600
好吧  我能解释的
All right, let me explain.

670
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,360
在那个地窖里
Back at the artifact vault,

671
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,300
我不小心激活了
I accidentally activated

672
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,960
某种古人通讯仪器
Some kind of ancestral communications device

673
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,200
导致我的意识被转移到这个女人的身体里
That caused my mind to transfer into this woman's body,

674
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,300
而她的意识在我这里
And hers into mine.

675
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,460
你觉得我们会相信么
You expect us to believe that?

676
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,960
你会的  杰尼克
Yeah, jannik, I do.

677
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,700
我知道你会相信的  就像你在瓦拉索尔
I expect you to believe that, just as you did on vara sol,

678
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,100
当我违背了和鱼商的交易
When I brokered that deal with the fish merchant

679
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,130
就为了救你
To save your life.

680
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:10,800
而你  布尔度
And you, bordal.

681
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,260
如果你不相信我
If you didn't trust me

682
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,400
那当你在窑子里被抓的时候
Back when you got caught at that brothel,

683
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,730
那些女人们
Those women would've made sure

684
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:18,200
绝对会废了你下半身幸福
The thought of procreating never again entered your mind.

685
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,360
这你是怎么知道的
How do you know about that?

686
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,700
因为我是尼娃
Because I'm neeva.

687
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,860
我和这女人是有关联的
There's a link between this woman and me.

688
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:25,260
我脑袋里是她的意识  她脑袋里的是我
Her mind is in my body, and mine is in hers.

689
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,000
不管在这里发生了什么
Look, whatever's happening here,

690
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,360
和我一点关系都没有
I had nothing to do with it.

691
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:30,960
是的  和她没关系
No, she didn't.

692
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,700
如果要解决这个问题  那就得赶快行动
But if we're going to fix this, we need to move fast.

693
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,260
必须得赶回那个小村子
We need to go back to the village,

694
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:37,600
去那个地窖  把仪器关掉
Break into the vault, and turn off that device.

695
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,000
我们必须非常小心
We need to be really careful,

696
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
不止那些村民在找我们
Because not only are the villagers out looking for us,

697
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,730
亚城的人  也在找我们
But so are the people from atlantis.

698
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,130
等等  他们来了?
W-w-wait a second. they're here?

699
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:45,830
谁  谢帕德中校?
Who, colonel sheppard?

700
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:48,000
还有其他人  他们会把我们交给村民的
Among others, but they'll turn us in to the villagers

701
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,160
如果不小心被抓
If they catch us,

702
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,560
所以  你不要给我们惹麻烦
So we need no problems from you.

703
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,160
明白?
Do you understand me?

704
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:56,100
好了  我们得找到那个仪器
All right, we need to find this device--

705
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,800
等一下
Stop!

706
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:01,800
我还是不明白到底怎么回事
I don't know what's going on here.

707
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,100
我告诉过你了
I just told you, all right?

708
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:03,960
我是尼娃
I am neeva.

709
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,400
我从来就没见过你
I've never seen you before!

710
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,500
杰尼克  听我说
Jannik, listen to me.

711
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,200
现在不是犯傻的时候
This is not the time to be stupid.

712
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,860
我不会惹他生气
Uh, I wouldn't make him angry...

713
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,230
把枪放下
You're going to put down the gun,

714
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:12,930
听清楚我说的
And you're going to listen to what I say.

715
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:14,800
不  我不听
No. I'm not.

716
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,930
你们通通跟我走
I'm going to take the both of you with me.

717
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:20,800
现在就去偷袭戒指
We're going to attack the ring now.

718
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,500
然后我们会搞清楚  到底谁是谁
And we'll sort out who's really who on another planet.

719
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:28,960
如果你骗我  那你死定了
And if you're lying to me, you're as good as dead.

720
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:37,260
那个麦凯博士
This dr. mckay...

721
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,760
他怎么啦
What about him?

722
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,760
他配不上你
You can do better.

723
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,200
闭嘴
Be quiet.

724
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,830
杰尼克  我知道这很难相信
Jannik, I know this is difficult to understand--

725
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:46,930
一开始时我也接受不了
I was equally confused by it at the beginning,

726
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:47,930
可是你得
But you have to--

727
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,500
多少人
How many?

728
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,900
我不知道
I don't know!

729
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,430
我数了四个
I count four.

730
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:04,200
如果你给我们武器  情况会好很多
We'd be a lot better off if you'd given us weapons.

731
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,930
他死了
He's dead.

732
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:29,500
嘿  退到这儿来
Hey! come back here!

733
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,930
别
Stop!

734
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:33,560
杰尼克  住手
Jannik, don't! don't!

735
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,960
她会没事么
Is she going to be all right?

736
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,000
目前不会  得先给她止血
Aye, for now, but I need to stop the bleeding.

737
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,060
罗德尼  扶着她
Here, hold her steady, rodney.

738
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,260
你们两个  帮个忙
You two, give us a hand here, please.

739
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,160
放桌子上  罗德尼
On the table, rodney.

740
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,730
这些人就是来自亚特兰蒂斯的
These are the people from atlantis

741
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:26,660
我之前跟你说过
I was telling you about.

742
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,860
发生什么事了
What happened?

743
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,030
她被你们的人打中了
She was shot by one of your men.

744
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,430
我警告过你
I warned you

745
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:31,960
到外面乱跑很危险的
It was dangerous to venture out there.

746
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,960
什么  她死了吗
What, is she dead?

747
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,000
没  只是受伤很严重
No, but she's badly wounded.

748
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,430
泰勒  帮个忙
Teyla, going to need a hand.

749
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:37,100
我得取出子弹  然后还得止住血
I need to remove the bullet and stop the bleeding.

750
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,700
我们得去找到那个通讯仪器
And we need access to that communication terminal.

751
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,000
马上把它关掉
We need to shut it down right now!

752
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,900
为什么  它干了什么
Why? what's it doing?

753
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,900
简而言之  它给这两人建立了精神上的联系
Well, simply put, it creates a psychic link between two people.

754
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,230
现在这个凯勒医生和尼娃·卡索尔
So dr. keller and this neeva casol

755
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,130
互相调了个
Have switched places.

756
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,160
都在对方的身体里
They're in each other's bodies.

757
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,800
你知道亚特兰蒂斯吧
You know about atlantis, right?

758
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,930
是的
Yes.

759
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:51,060
最好与我们为友
Then you know you're better off

760
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,230
而不是与我们为敌
Being our friend than our enemy.

761
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,760
那就表现的友好点
So why don't you be our friend

762
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,460
告诉我们那个通讯终端在哪儿
And show us where that terminal is?

763
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,460
这边走
This way.

764
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,800
它还开着
It's still on!

765
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,960
显然
Obviously.

766
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,200
那就关掉它
So turn it off.

767
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,360
没有开关啊
Well, there's no switches.

768
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:23,530
貌似和星门一队找到那个一样
But it looks almost identical to the one sg-1 found.

769
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:34,060
子弹取出
There's the bullet...

770
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:38,400
接下来就是止血了
Now to stem the bleeding.

771
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,730
我不知道你是谁
I don't know who you are...

772
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:50,860
但你肯定不是尼娃
But you are definitely not neeva.

773
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:53,060
是的  我不是
No, I'm not.

774
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,930
但我也不是你们的敌人
But I'm not your enemy, either,

775
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:56,230
只要你允许
And if you'd just let me,

776
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:57,400
我相信我能...
I think I can help--

777
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,760
你帮不了任何人
You're not helping anyone.

778
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,800
快点快点
Come on! hurry up!

779
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,960
我在试了啊
Believe me, I'm trying!

780
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,560
完全没法控制这个晶体
There's no way to access the control crystal.

781
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,560
好像根本没法关掉它
There doesn't seem to be a way to shut this thing off!

782
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,260
好吧  要不然  我们炸了它
All right. what if... what if we blow it up?

783
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,000
好吧  我不知道  或许可以吧
Well, I don't know. I mean, maybe.

784
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,860
我不确定  爆炸是否会引起
I'm just not sure if the explosion could cause

785
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:16,860
突然间能量波动
A sudden power surge--

786
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,260
那其他人怎么处理
What the hell'd the other guys do?

787
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,760
以前星门一队拨了号
Well, sg-1, dialed the gate,

788
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,360
把它丢到了逐渐成形的虫洞里
And tossed the device into the vortex

789
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,460
立马被分解了
Of the forming wormhole-- disintegrated instantly.

790
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,500
但这儿离星门太远  我们根本搬不过去
But it's too far to carry back to the gate.

791
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,700
你间接害死了布尔度
You got bordal killed.

792
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:31,560
也害我差点就死了
And you've almost got me killed.

793
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,760
我会以牙还牙的
I'm going to return the favor.

794
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,330
我们没什么选择的余地了
We may not have much of a choice,

795
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:37,660
那来帮忙搬一搬吧
So give me a hand with this.

796
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,600
不知道来不来得及啊
I'm not sure we've got the time--

797
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,760
等等
Hold up.

798
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,660
闪开
Move!

799
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:55,430
凯勒医生
Dr. keller?

800
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:56,760
泰勒
Teyla.

801
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,600
你回来了?
You're back?

802
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,600
我回来了
I'm back.

803
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,930
你中枪了  亲爱的
Shh. you've been shot, love.

804
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:06,200
别担心  子弹已经取出来了
Don't worry, we removed the bullet.

805
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,460
你会没事的
You'll be just fine.

806
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,630
等等  杰尼克
Wait, jannik.

807
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:15,060
是我啊  尼娃
It's me, neeva.

808
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:17,660
他们把仪器关掉了
They must've turned off the device.

809
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:20,730
想得美
Nice try.

810
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:25,500
杰尼克  不要!
Jannik, no!

811
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,560
谢谢你  丹娜
I appreciate that, dana.

812
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,660
代我问好
Say hello for me.

813
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,400
哇  这是什么日子呢
Well, well, well! what's the occasion?

814
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,530
就是来医务室看看朋友
Oh, just visiting a friend in the infirmary.

815
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:37,860
你真体贴  罗德尼
That's very thoughtful of you, rodney.

816
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,160
我知道
I know.

817
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,800
罗恩中士和他的分队已经回来了
Major lorne and his team just returned.

818
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,300
他们仔细检查了那个星球
They did a full sweep of the planet.

819
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,100
没有尼娃·卡索尔的踪影
No sign of neeva casol.

820
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,700
她肯定是跑掉了
She must've managed to escape.

821
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,800
这就不知道了
I don't know about that.

822
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,260
据珍妮弗说
According to jennifer,

823
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,830
她的同伙正准备杀了她
Her accomplice was just about to kill her

824
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:51,430
我们这时又刚好把仪器给关了
When we shut down the communication terminal.

825
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:52,630
好吧  她要么就是被同伙杀了
Well, either he did kill her

826
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:54,130
然后被抛尸荒野
And disposed of the body before escaping himself,

827
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:56,000
要么就是逃脱了
Or she got away from him somehow.

828
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,500
这就不得而知了
Well, I guess we'll never know.

829
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,560
我们会知道的
Well, we may.

830
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,760
已经放出消息了
Word has gone out

831
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,130
跟我们的同盟星球说过了
To several planets in the coalition.

832
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:03,100
如果尼娃确实还活着
If neeva is alive and roaming free,

833
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,930
那也活不久了
She won't be for long.

834
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,400
向我保证别太劳累了
You'll promise you'll take it easy?

835
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,860
会的  医生
Yes, doctor.

836
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,300
别担心  有我在
Don't worry. I'll make sure of it.

837
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,300
你好啊
Hey, you.

838
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,300
你好啊
Hey, you.

839
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,460
谢谢啊  罗德尼
Oh, thank you, rodney.

840
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,900
鲜花加巧克力  真让我感动
Flowers and chocolates? I'm impressed.

841
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,260
好吧  够了
Right. enough.

842
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,560
她孤伶伶的在医务室
She's all alone in the infirmary.

843
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,800
我只是觉得  我可以
I just thought I would, you know,

844
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,660
装点下房间
Brighten the room up a bit.

845
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,660
嗨  瑞迪克
Oh. hey, radek.

846
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:27,930
你怎样了
How you doing?

847
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:30,360
好多了  谢谢
Better. thanks.

848
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:33,560
瑞迪克  我真的很抱歉
Again, radek, I am so sorry for what happened.

849
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,760
那不是你的错
It's not your fault.

850
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,460
跟你说了  别担心
I told you, don't worry.

851
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,230
我很好
I'm fine.

852
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:39,230
是啊  他当然好
Yeah, yeah, of course he's fine.

853
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,800
看他红光满面容光焕发的  可以回去工作了
He's perky, rosy-cheeked, ready to go back to work.

854
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,800
我可不知道
I don't know about that...

855

他也需要休息  罗德尼

他受的伤比我严重多了

要不我把你推到其他房间去吧

等你稍微好转了
When you're feeling better,

869

我们或许可以

我们或许可以出去逛逛

871
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:26,960
逛逛?
A ride?

872
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,300
是啊
Yeah, you know,

873
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,030
找个小飞船  去大陆
Take the puddle jumper, go to the mainland,

874
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:31,730
然后野餐  或许可以

875
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:33,460
躺在星空下
Lie out under the stars?

876
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,530
什么
What?

877
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:39,000
你确实关掉了
You did turn off

878
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,060
那个通讯终端么
That communication terminal, right?

879
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,560
怎么感觉像另外一个人了
There's no one else in there?

880
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,960
真的是我啊
No, it's really me.

881
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,100
那个坐小飞船去逛逛

我知道  不是我的风格
So not me. right, okay.

885
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,130
是个坏主意
No, bad idea.

886
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:53,600
不啊
No...
