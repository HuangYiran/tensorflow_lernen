00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,960
我会大声叫的 别过来
And I'm not keeping quiet. No.

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,040
别过来 走开!
No, keep away!

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,200
别过来! 走开!
Get back! No, get away!

4
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,240
放开我!
Let go!

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,880
救命!
Help!

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,720
费雪小姐探案集 第二季第十一集
          死亡直播间

7
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,720
可以接收到多少个电台?
How many stations can it pick up?

8
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,200
恐怕只有3Jh 因为有限制执照
Only 3JH, I'm afraid. That's how a restricted licence works

9
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,680
那太好了
That's perfect.

10
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,520
那请问这3Jh有什么特别的吗?
May I ask what's so particular about this 3JH?

11
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,000
里面有关于庞静赫尔的
It has The Polkinghorns.

12
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,400
一个曾经在我学校读书的女孩帮忙制作的
A girl who went to my school helps to make it.

13
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,160
现在重新回到了我们的每日剧集
Now it's time to revisit our daily serial,

14
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,000
与庞静赫尔在家中
At Home With The Polkinghorns.

15
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,560
新的一天
A New Day.

16
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,520
我好像听到了的士的声音
That sounds like the taxi now.

17
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,240
玛丽斯
Maurice...

18
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,040
肯定是我们的格温妮亚回来了
..it must be our Guinevere,

19
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,680
赶上了她二十一岁的生日
home in time for her 21st birthday.

20
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,720
- 谁是格温妮亚? - 他们的女儿
- Who's Guinevere? - Their daughter.

21
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,880
看看外面 玛丽斯 是我们的格温妮亚
Look outside, Maurice - our Guinevere.

22
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,440
- 她人呢? - 嘘
- Where is she? - Ssh!

23
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,360
我...
I...

24
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,480
在她做了那些事后 我不想再见到她
..don't want to see her after what she did.

25
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,880
她做了什么?
What did she do?

26
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,880
和一个意大利歌剧歌手私奔了
Ran off with an Italian opera singer.

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,240
果真如此
We've all done that.

28
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,160
但我们正在直播
But we are on air.

29
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,960
继续啊!
(Come on!)

30
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,760
女佣怎么耽搁这么久?
Whatever is keeping that maid?

31
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,160
- 她死了 - 谁死了?
- She's dead. - Who's dead?

32
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,080
路易莎 到外面来 把那东西关掉!
Louisa, outside. Just turn the blasted thing off!

33
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,040
路易莎・金乐顿是我那朋友
L... Louisa Singleton is the girl I know.

34
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,800
电台称是报社引起的战争 将在阿格斯上演
Radios claim newspaper war. Out now in the Argus.

35
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,960
费雪小姐 你怎么知道的?
Ah, Miss Fisher. How did you know?

36
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,440
我们刚才在听无线电台
We were listening to the wireless.

37
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,320
路易莎这一生原有很多美好的打算
Louisa was going to do so many wonderful things.

38
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,342
我是侦探费雪小姐 
Miss Fisher, detective, 

39
00:03:16,343 --> 00:03:18,880
这是我的助理威廉姆斯小姐
and my assistant, Miss Williams.

40
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,267
我是吉米・克里斯维奇 3Jh电台的经理 
Jimmy Creswick, station manager, 3JH, 

41
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:23,720
这是我的妻子海斯尔
and my wife, Hazel.

42
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,782
这是路易莎? 
And this is Louisa? 

43
00:03:25,783 --> 00:03:28,320
是的 我们的得力助手
Yes, our Girl Friday,

44
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,680
路易莎・金乐顿小姐
Miss Louisa Singleton.

45
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,320
真让人悲伤
How awful.

46
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,360
- 他们说会找上我们的 - 谁?
- They said they'd get us. - Who did?

47
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,320
海斯尔 亲爱的 到里面休息冷静一下
Hazel, love, come inside and calm down.

48
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,520
看起来她是被勒死的
Looks like she was strangled.

49
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,760
真可惜 她还那么年轻
Such a shame, one so young.

50
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,560
- 真可怕 - 如果她昨天是穿着这身衣服
- Terrible. - Time of death, 6:40pm,

51
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,120
并且在当时手表正常工作的话
if we assume she was wearing these clothes yesterday

52
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,040
她的死亡时间是傍晚六点四十分
and her watch was in good working order.

53
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,280
谢谢 剩下的由我来处理 请往后退 谢谢
Thank you. I'll take it from here. Step back, please. Thank you.

54
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,080
请往后退
Step right back, please.

55
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,360
罗宾森警探呢?
Where's Inspector Robinson?

56
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,992
他... 他正在调查另一个案件 
He's... He's on another job. 

57
00:04:06,993 --> 00:04:08,640
那我们可以帮你 休斯
We'd be happy to assist you, Hugh.

58
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,920
金乐顿小姐以前在学校里是多蒂的朋友
Miss Singleton was a school friend of Dot's.

59
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,680
如果我不帮忙 她不会原谅我的
She'd never forgive me if I didn't help.

60
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,720
小姐
Miss?

61
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,400
警探正在乔装卧底
The other job the Inspector's on...

62
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:25,680
调查另一个机密的案子
..he's uncover and it's confidential.

63
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,040
真有趣 走吧 多蒂
Sounds intriguing. Come on, Dot.

64
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,440
是的 就是她昨天所穿的衣服
Yes, exactly the same outfit that she was in yesterday.

65
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,680
我们只是以为她早上迟到了
We just thought she was late this morning.

66
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,240
尽管路易莎从来不会迟到 今天是第一次
Even though Louisa was never late. Today of all days.

67
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,680
在庞静赫尔家饰演格温妮亚对她而言很重要
Playing Guinevere in The Polkinghorns was her big step up.

68
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,440
有人想要蓄意伤害金乐顿小姐吗
Is there anyone who might have wanted to harm Miss Singleton?

69
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,240
没有 路易莎把她的精力都放在工作上
No. Louisa put all her efforts into her work.

70
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,440
好姑娘 书本整理好 剧本也都是她打的
Top girl. She kept the books neat, typed up all our scripts.

71
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,720
她接受了3Jh的工作后
She broke it off with her fiance in Perth

72
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,480
在珀斯和未婚夫分手了
when she was offered the job at 3JH.

73
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,920
这里有路易莎的衣服吗?
Are any of these coats Louisa's?

74
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,720
那披风就是她的
Yes, the cloak.

75
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,160
我可以帮你做记录
I can scribe, if you like.

76
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,760
没有任何的抱怨或者威胁吗?
So no grudges, threats?

77
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,680
没有专门针对她的
Not against her in particular.

78
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,160
几天前有几通电话
There were telephone calls a few days ago.

79
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,530
海斯尔接了一通 路易莎接了另一通 
Hazel took one, Louisa the other. 

80
00:05:26,531 --> 00:05:27,440
对方是一个男人
It was a man.

81
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,200
他警告我们 把电台关掉 不然他就亲自动手
He warned us to shut down the station or he'd do it himself.

82
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,520
因此我们知道会有麻烦
We've been expecting trouble.

83
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,760
别的电台都有受到攻击
There have been attacks on other radio stations.

84
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,800
我们从最高点跌倒了低谷
From our brightest night to our darkest day.

85
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,120
昨晚海斯尔在澳大利亚电台表演颁奖礼上
Hazel was crowned Best Female Talent last night

86
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,360
被誉为最有天赋的女性
at the Australian Recorded Performance Awards.

87
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,600
哦 不!
Oh, no!

88
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,000
奥斯沃德
Oh, Oswald.

89
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,936
没事 海斯尔 只是一条金鱼 
Come now, Hazel. It's only a goldfish. 

90
00:05:56,937 --> 00:05:58,920
它可能只是寿命已尽了
It was probably his time.

91
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,040
对不起 我平常不这样的
Sorry. I'm not normally like this.

92
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,320
早安 现在是十点新闻
Good morning. This is the Ten O'clock News.

93
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,386
从七月份开始 
From July, 

94
00:06:06,387 --> 00:06:08,200
有轨电车会从东边城郊部分开通
electric trams will run from the eastern suburbs.

95
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,680
这声音!
That voice!

96
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,280
这不但能减缓市中心的交通问题
This is predicted not only to alleviate traffic in the centre

97
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,120
更能为城市带来更多的消费者
but bring new shoppers to the city,

98
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,960
让他们享受商店豪华的阵容
where they can enjoy a splendid array

99
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,760
以及餐厅各类的美味
of stores and restaurants that cater to all tastes.

100
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,040
阿奇伯・琼斯先生 他声音很悦耳
Mr Archibald Jones, he of the dulcet tones.

101
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,560
你们是怎么找到他的?
Wherever did you find him?

102
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,880
不是我们找的
We didn't.

103
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,240
3Jh董事会在上周决定开播一小时新闻节目
The board of 3JH decided last week to offer an hourly news service.

104
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,200
原本我们打算培训克莱瑞斯来担任主持
We wanted to train Clarence for the role

105
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,480
可经理请了琼斯先生
but management hired Mr Jones.

106
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,259
你去坐下来休息一下好吗 亲爱的? 
Why don't you go and have a sit-down, love? 

107
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,480
你受到惊吓了
You've had a shock.

108
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,920
是啊 宝贝 我确实感到有些累
You're right, darling. I do feel slightly shattered.

109
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,600
我刚认识她的时候
She couldn't get out more than two words

110
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,840
她站在麦克风前都说不出话
in front of a microphone when I first met her.

111
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,440
或许有个私人侦探能让她安心些
Perhaps having a private detective around would reassure her,

112
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,080
侦探会谨慎点
a discreet presence.

113
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,800
要是我说 最需要被要看紧的是这个家伙
If you ask me, the one to look out for is that bloke.

114
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,280
我一点也不相信他
I wouldn't trust him as far as I could spit.

115
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,003
下个小时 将会给大家带来
There will be more news in the next hour, 

116
00:07:07,004 --> 00:07:08,640
更多的新闻 不要走开
so please stay tuned.

117
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,003
稍后 将会由克莱瑞斯・鲍尔
Shortly, Clarence Ball will be with you 

118
00:07:11,004 --> 00:07:12,360
带来每日体育新闻
for the daily sporting news.

119
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,920
但请先欣赏一段音乐
But first, a musical interlude.

120
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,200
在你解释前 阿奇伯...
Before you say anything, Archibald...

121
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,600
谢天谢地你在这里 我需要你接手这件案子
Thank goodness you're here. I need you to move in on this case.

122
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,185
柯林斯一个人处理不了 
Collins can't handle this alone. 

123
00:07:28,186 --> 00:07:29,720
是杰克・罗宾森在说话吗?
Is this Jack Robinson speaking,

124
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,200
还是你仍在隐姓埋名?
or are you still incognito?

125
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,040
你是想让我帮助休斯
You want me to ride shotgun over Hugh

126
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,080
希望你换种说法
I wish you wouldn't put it quite like that.

127
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,880
- 那你可以友好地问我 - 想让我求你?
- You could ask nicely. - Want me to beg?

128
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,320
就此一次而已
This may never happen again.

129
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,320
求你了
Please.

130
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,840
我只能呆在这留意观察
I'm stuck here, keeping an eye on things.

131
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,508
那你太不细心了 
Not a very keen eye. 

132
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:48,960
有人在傍晚六点四十分被杀了
Someone was killed at 6:40pm, to be precise.

133
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,680
昨晚我向市政厅作报告
I was reporting to Commissioner Hall last night.

134
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,320
在过去的六个月里
Four radio stations from Melbourne and Sydney

135
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,800
从墨尔本到悉尼 有四家电台关门了
have been shut down in the last six months.

136
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,000
他们被抢劫 被肆意破坏 或者被纵火
They've been robbed, vandalised or set alight.

137
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,840
我们都知道 一旦电台倒闭了 谁的收益最大
Well, we both know who has the most to lose, with radio taking off.

138
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,520
报社 如果能在无限电台听到新闻
Newspapers. Why buy a newspaper

139
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,680
就没有必要再买报纸了
if you've already heard the headlines on the wireless?

140
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,320
你现在怀疑有内奸?
But you suspect an inside job?

141
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,396
克莱瑞斯・鲍尔 就是那家伙 
Clarence Ball - foley man, 

142
00:08:12,397 --> 00:08:14,040
弹钢琴的 也是体育播报员
piano player, sports presenter.

143
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,720
一系列电话骚扰后 他离开了
Left radio station 3XL one week before it burned to the ground

144
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,040
3Xl电台没多久 电台就被烧成了灰
after a series of menacing phone calls.

145
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,640
这么巧的时间
Suspiciously good timing.

146
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,880
先来看看狂欢夜少女
Let's have a look at the Corroborree Maiden first.

147
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,760
在第七场 我选择了复活节再会 二号
In the seventh, my pick is Paschal Vaya, number two.

148
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,920
在第八场 我们关注五号...
In the eighth, we're looking at number five...

149
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,840
克莱瑞斯・鲍尔在直播 我听了不少
Clarence Ball's On The Track. I've heard a lot about this.

150
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,720
他的建议有什么特别的?
What's so remarkable about these tips?

151
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,880
有些并不准
Not very good odds, some of them.

152
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,640
我也这么认为 这只是他的喜好而已
I'm with you. These are just all the favourites.

153
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,760
酒吧老板跟着这家伙赚了一大笔钱
The barman at the pub is making a packet out of this bloke.

154
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,880
就是跟着他下的注
Col swears by him.

155
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,800
请在下午的老时间调到名人堂
Tune in this afternoon at the usual time for Hall Of Fame -

156
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,800
将是你猜中当代雌马的机会
your chance to guess our Mare of the Moment.

157
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,360
我们肯定漏掉了什么
Nah. We're missing something with this joker.

158
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,600
昨天最后一场比赛在六点五十五分无线播出
The results of the last race came in on the wire at 6:55,

159
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,280
接着电台在七点关门
then the station closed at seven.

160
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,040
因此你是最后一个离开办公室的?
You were the last to leave the office?

161
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,640
没错
That's right.

162
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,640
吉米和海斯尔在五点三十分离开 去了颁奖礼
Jimmy and Hazel left at 5:30 to go to a... fancy awards do.

163
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,640
看起来克里斯维奇夫人让3Jh成功不少啊
Looks like Mrs Creswick has really made 3JH a success story.

164
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,440
墨尔本电台的最佳女主播奖
Best Female Talent on Melbourne Radio

165
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,101
要知道多少人听我的体育新闻下注 
You'd be surprised how many punters tune 

166
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:30,040
你会大吃一惊
in to my sporting news,

167
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,040
跟我现场直播下注的更多
even more to my live race calls.

168
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,720
你应该刚来这电台没多久 是吗?
But... you haven't been at the station for long, have you?

169
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,760
- 之前你在哪高就? - 3Xl电台
- Where were you previously? - Radio 3XL.

170
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,440
在那儿我也有很多听众
I had quite a following there too.

171
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,836
那电台倒闭了 是吗? 
That station closed down, didn't it? 

172
00:09:40,837 --> 00:09:41,960
我记得是发生了场火灾
A fire, I believe.

173
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,920
那时
Before my time.

174
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,043
我们产生了争执 
Difference of opinion. 

175
00:09:48,044 --> 00:09:50,400
回到金乐顿小姐的身上
Back to Miss Singleton,

176
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,880
昨晚她是几点离开办公室的?
what time did she leave the office last night?

177
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,480
她在我上班前给我沏了杯茶
She made me a cuppa before my shift.

178
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,400
接着在晚班七点结束以前
Then there was no sign of her

179
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,320
我都没有再见到她
when the evening session finished at seven.

180
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,640
路易莎负责什么工作?
What was Louisa working on?

181
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,560
简单的诗歌 给节目出主意 写故事
Jingles, ideas for shows, stories.

182
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,680
我告诉她这完全是在浪费时间
I told her it was a complete waste of time.

183
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,440
海斯尔确保她写的每个字都会播出
Hazel made damn sure she wrote every word that went to air.

184
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,600
她没想到路易莎对此有觊觎?
She didn't think Louisa was up to the task?

185
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,920
那你得问海斯尔了
You'd have to ask Hazel that.

186
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,080
就你所知 他们吵过架吗?
Did they ever disagree, to your knowledge?

187
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,600
海斯尔最近很麻烦
Hazel's been tricky lately.

188
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:25,560
路易莎也不是她骂过的第一个了
Louisa wouldn't be the only one she's crossed swords with.

189
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,182
你最好合作 阿奇 
You'd better cooperate, Archie. 

190
00:10:32,183 --> 00:10:35,040
吉米已经认为是你下手的了
Jimmy already thinks you did it.

191
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,160
- 什么? - 你确实举止怪异
- What? - You are behaving very suspiciously.

192
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,640
克莱瑞斯有机会谋杀路易莎啊
Clarence had the opportunity to murder Louisa.

193
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,440
他在音乐播放期间很容易溜出播音间啊
He could easily slip out of the studio in a musical interlude.

194
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,800
海斯尔和路易莎关系不好 创新力竞争
Hazel and Louisa didn't get on. Creative competition.

195
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,520
你们又看到播音顺序吗?
Have you seen a running order anywhere?

196
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,200
我们失去了路易莎一团乱
We're in such a mess without Louisa.

197
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,680
在这
Here it is.

198
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,840
谢天谢地
Oh, thank goodness.

199
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,840
也许多蒂能帮上忙
Perhaps Dot could be of some help.

200
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,400
那就太棒了
That would be wonderful.

201
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,960
我带你看看要做什么
I'll show you what needs to be done.

202
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,480
警察有嫌疑犯了吗?
So, do the police have any ideas?

203
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,360
任何人都有可能 你也知道谁成天在那晃
Could be anyone. You know the type who hang around here.

204
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,840
谁啊?
Like who?

205
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,240
卖报的小伙就算一个
That bloke from the newspaper stand for one.

206
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:24,320
路易莎抱怨他总是随心所欲晃进来
Louisa complained about him waltzing in here whenever he felt like it.

207
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,120
我真希望当时多留意他 采取些行动
I only wish I'd taken more notice and done something about him.

208
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,640
给你 谢谢 科博
There you go. Thanks, cobber.

209
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,040
阿格斯 谢谢
Argus, thanks.

210
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,880
你对路易莎很熟咯?
So, you knew Louisa pretty well?

211
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,400
我希望多了解她
I'd hoped to know her even better.

212
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,440
我几次邀请她去跳舞
I asked her to go dancing a couple of times.

213
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,680
- 她拒绝了? - 拒了两次而已
- She turned you down? - Only twice.

214
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,360
我还有机会的
I was still in with a chance.

215
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,240
我从她想激怒我的举止中悟到的
I could tell by the way she liked to tick me off.

216
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,040
我昨晚也见她了 她从我这买了小面包
I saw her last night too. She bought a bun from me.

217
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,160
说她要回去工作了
Said she was going back to work.

218
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,480
也许你该告诉警察
Maybe you should tell the cops.

219
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,480
我才不要招惹上警察
I'm not getting mixed up with the cops,

220
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,720
那也不会路易莎死而复生
and it won't bring Louisa back.

221
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,600
来买报纸哟! 报纸! 
Get your papers here! Paper!

222
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,320
你确定我们没遗漏什么 休斯?
Are you sure there's nothing we've missed, Hugh?

223
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,560
她想嫁给那个珀斯的小伙
She wanted to marry that bloke in Perth,

224
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,360
但是却醉心于广播事业
but she had her heart set on radio.

225
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,969
是的 路易莎 和我一样十五岁离开学校 
Yes, Louisa, she left school at 15, like me, 

226
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,240
可她一直很聪明
but she was always smart.

227
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:35,920
你也很聪明啊 协助女侦探工作
Well, you must be smart too, assisting a lady detective.

228
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,280
好吧 来测测你
Rightio, let's test you.

229
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,960
猜这只鸟
Guess this bird.

230
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,040
- 我放弃 - 这是黑天鹅
- I give up. - That is the black swan,

231
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,560
西澳大利亚的官方标志鸟
the official bird of Western Australia.

232
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,320
我让你笑了 不是吗?
But I made you smile, didn't I?

233
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,240
你同僚去世还真对你影响颇深啊
Deeply affected by your colleague's passing, are you?

234
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,480
你什么毛病 警员? 我跟你交代完了
What's your problem, Constable? I've told you everything I know.

235
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,840
你昨晚为何没听见小巷里有干扰?
Why didn't you hear any disturbance in the alley last night?

236
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,760
外面可能有枪战
There could have been heavy mortar fire outside

237
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,640
我都听不到的
and I wouldn't have heard a thing.

238
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,400
播音室是隔音的
That studio is completely soundproof.

239
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,920
救人啊 警员 快来救人!
Help! Constable, help, quickly!

240
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,640
噢 吉米!
Oh, Jimmy!

241
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,160
往后站 海斯尔 别动!
Stay back, Hazel. Don't touch it!

242
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,560
- 怎么回事? - 麦克风 电到我了
- What happened? - The microphone. I got a shock.

243
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,680
- 别靠近 - 关掉电源
- Stand back, please. - Turn off the power.

244
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,200
大厅里有保险丝
There's a fuse box in the hall.

245
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,720
危机解除
All clear.

246
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,400
有急救箱吗?
Is there a first-aid box?

247
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,200
没事 我没事
It's fine. I'll be alright.

248
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,600
他们也想害你 他们都想把我们害死
They tried to get you. They're going to knock us all off, I know it.

249
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,080
2WA也出了这样的事
The same thing happened at 2WA.

250
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,360
我确定这只是个意外
I'm sure it's nothing more than a silly accident.

251
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,840
告诉她 费雪小姐 
Tell her, Miss Fisher. 

252
00:13:52,841 --> 00:13:54,520
我也想这么说 可是...
I'd like to agree, but...

253
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,640
电线是被故意磨碎损的
The wires have been deliberately frayed.

254
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,960
不是的 先生 探长罗宾森自己阻止了电刑
No, sir. Inspector Robinson prevented the electrocution himself.

255
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,240
好的
Yes.

256
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,200
好的 先生
Yes, sir.

257
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,560
我会传达指令
I'll pass on the message.

258
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,440
谢谢你 先生 马上就去
Thank you, sir. Right away.

259
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,040
看起来很自在啊 休斯
Looking right at home there, Hugh.

260
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,040
你急忙执行探长之命时
In your haste to follow the Inspector's orders,

261
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,080
把路易莎・金乐顿的笔记本落下了
you left Louisa Singleton's notebook behind.

262
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,920
谢谢你 小姐 怎么会发生这样的事?
Thank you, Miss. How did that happen?

263
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:33,200
我们想着你需要些帮手检查路易莎的东西
We thought you might need some help going through Louisa's things.

264
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,760
探长的秘密甜点!
The Inspector's secret stash!

265
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,680
小姐...
Miss...

266
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,480
干得好 休斯
Well done, Hugh.

267
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,600
真好吃
Mm, delicious.

268
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,200
一盒火柴 谢谢
A packet of matches, thanks.

269
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,960
还有 这是给你的
And, ah, this came for you.

270
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,240
特别快送
Special delivery.

271
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,840
谢谢 我一直盼着呢
Thanks. I've been expecting that.

272
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,480
卖报纸!
Paper!

273
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,567
看看这个 休斯 
Look at this. 

274
00:15:22,568 --> 00:15:24,960
为什么路易莎要买州级火车票?
Why would Louisa buy an interstate train ticket?

275
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,360
一夜旅途去悉尼 下周启程 不予退票
An overnight sleeper to Sydney booked for next week. No return.

276
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:33,920
克莱瑞斯・鲍尔说海斯尔不喜欢路易莎的想法
Clarence Ball said Hazel didn't like any of Louisa's ideas,

277
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,280
可这是他们今早演出的庞静赫尔家
but this is the Polkinghorns episode they played this morning.

278
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,640
也许是她为海斯尔抄写的
Maybe she was just transcribing for Hazel.

279
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,880
看这里写道 作者 路易莎・金乐顿
Look, it says, 'Written by Miss Louisa Singleton.'

280
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,560
如果所有故事都是路易莎所创作
If all of those stories were Louisa's ideas

281
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,840
海斯尔却赢得名声 我不责备她想离开
and Hazel was taking all the glory, I don't blame her for trying to leave

282
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,160
那晚广播奖 晚上七点才开始的
That radio awards night, it didn't begin until 7:00pm

283
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,760
可是克里斯维奇夫妇五点半就走了
but the Creswicks left the studio at 5:30.

284
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,200
有充分时间可以绕路
That's plenty of time for a detour.

285
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:06,480
我们要和海斯尔谈谈 下午茶吧
We need a quiet word with Hazel, a casual tete-a-tete.

286
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,480
把车开来 多蒂
Bring the car around, Dot.

287
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,040
两位的茶
Tea For Two.

288
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,360
女人干家务劳累一天
What better, after a woman's long day of household toils

289
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,320
男人在外拼搏奋斗
and a man's daily battles with the world

290
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,520
还有什么比这时来两杯泰利家茶更好的呢?
than a steaming brew for two of Tilley's tea?

291
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,480
致意温暖的家
To celebrate hearth and home...

292
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,800
不论谁人来访
..no matter who comes calling,

293
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,360
或是在夜晚为爱人
or prepare for an evening of loving companionship

294
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,600
在床上送上一杯
with the little ones tucked safely in bed.

295
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,840
泰利家茶 3JH广播赞助商
Tilley's tea, proud sponsor of 3JH Radio,

296
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,320
由轻松与活力打造 为您奉献
is made for relaxation and rejuvenation, just for you.

297
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,240
泰利的茶是泡茶的首选
Tilley's tea is tip-top tea from the very best tips to your teapot.

298
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,520
如果我能借用那个打印机 我能把笔记打给你
If I could borrow that typewriter, I could type these notes for you.

299
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,160
谢谢 多蒂
Thanks, Dottie.

300
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:59,680
要是我这个做好了 我就离晋升更进一步了
You know, if I do well on this case, I'm one step closer to a promotion,

301
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:05,600
我们就有钱结婚了
which means we can afford to get married.

302
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,080
当你是休斯・柯林斯太太的时候
Then wise-cracking bird impersonators

303
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,840
才貌双全的你用武之地可要小很多了
won't be so free and easy when you're Mrs Hugh Collins.

304
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,120
我们该怎么跟你妈妈讲 休斯?
How are we going to tell your mother, Hugh?

305
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,160
我不在乎 我们在天主教教堂结婚 我转教
I don't care. We'll get married in a Catholic church. I'll convert.

306
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,400
可那会让你妈妈伤心的
But that would break your mother's heart.

307
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,360
我相信告诉费雪小姐后 她会有办法的
I'm sure if we tell Miss Phryne, she'll help us find a solution.

308
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,080
我们不能自己解决吗?
Can't we work it out ourselves?

309
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,640
你要不为她工作了 我们都要靠自己解决的
That's what we'll have to do when you don't work for her anymore.

310
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,120
什么?
Pardon?

311
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,960
一旦我们定了日子 你就会辞职
Once we set a date and you give notice,

312
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,520
费雪小姐要一人单干了
Miss Fisher's going to have to do without you.

313
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,760
没有我了? 
Without me?

314
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,760
放弃我的工作?
Give up my job?

315
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,440
是啊
Right.

316
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,480
多蒂!
Dot!

317
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,560
克里斯维奇先生
Mr Creswick.

318
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,560
我在等你的太太
I was expecting your wife.

319
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,680
海斯尔致上歉意 她受不了汽车劳顿
Hazel sends her apologies, but she wasn't up to the car trip.

320
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,120
你说威廉姆斯小姐能帮忙打字
You thought Miss Williams could help out with our typing.

321
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,760
当然 我很乐意帮忙
Of course. I'd be happy to help.

322
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,480
谢谢你 多蒂
Thank you, Dot.

323
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,280
既然你在这 我想问路易莎的事
While you're here, I would like a quiet word about Louisa.

324
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,920
当然
Of course.

325
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:27,120
看来她几乎每晚都在为广播剧创作
It seems she dedicated most of her evenings to writing for radio,

326
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,720
可任何作品都未播出?
but nothing of hers has been to air?

327
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,880
路易莎很有抱负 可她没有创作天赋
Louisa was very ambitious, but she had no training as a writer.

328
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:38,160
她更适合做打字员 海斯尔只用手写
She was needed far more as a typist. Hazel only writes in longhand.

329
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,960
那你怎么解释 今早这一集
Then how do you explain this - this morning's episode,

330
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,120
和路易莎笔记本上的一字不差?
word for word, in Louisa's personal notebook?

331
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,000
真的?
Really?

332
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:52,000
也许她从海斯尔的手稿中抄出来的
Well, perhaps she copied it from one of Hazel's scripts for some reason,

333
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,000
想学习或者...
to learn from or...

334
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,240
剽窃?
Plagiarism?

335
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,400
我希望事不至此
I hope that's not what it was.

336
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,360
有可能因为这个海斯尔跟她吵架吗?
Could that be why Hazel argued with her?

337
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,560
任何争吵不过一时不快而已
Any arguments they had couldn't have been more than a tiff.

338
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,200
我们工作区域小 很多不合很常见
We work in very close quarters, and disagreements are bound to happen.

339
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,560
路易莎有说过自己有旅行计划吗?
Did Louisa mention that she had any travel plans?

340
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,040
我不知道
Not that I know of.

341
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,560
可是海斯尔很信赖她
But Hazel was very reliant on her,

342
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:24,240
要是她想搬走 会让她很伤心的
and if she were about to move on, that would have left her in the lurch

343
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,800
是的 如果我们知道 我们都会很伤心
Yes. It would have left us all in the lurch, if we'd known about it.

344
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,480
昨晚你和海斯尔几点到达颁奖典礼?
What time did you and Hazel arrive at the award ceremony last night?

345
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,440
我不确定
I can't be sure.

346
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,080
我们有点迟了
We were a little late.

347
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,160
海斯尔的头疼病犯了
Hazel was nursing one of her headaches,

348
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,800
我要比她先走一步
and I had to go on ahead of her.

349
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,582
所以她呆在家里了? 
So she stayed at home? 

350
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:43,800
只待了半个小时
Only for half an hour.

351
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,163
然后她坐上出租车赶上了我 
Then she grabbed a cab and joined me. 

352
00:19:46,164 --> 00:19:47,520
那真是美好的一晚
It was a wonderful evening.

353
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,720
最开始确实不错 但可惜路易莎遭遇了不幸
To start with, anyway, but it ended sadly for Louisa.

354
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,840
那个 我必须要回电台去了
Look, I have to get back to the station

355
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,240
看看海斯尔是不是完全掌控了
and check Hazel's on top of things.

356
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,920
今天早上我们已经丢了条赞助商的广告播出
We've already missed one sponsor's message this morning.

357
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,080
我对参演很感兴趣 而且我有一些演出经验
I'd be happy to step in. I do have performance experience.

358
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,560
真的吗?
Really?

359
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,880
不管怎么说 我也需要在电台呆着
I need to be around the station in any case.

360
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,200
我不希望海斯尔觉得自己被取代了
I wouldn't want Hazel to feel displaced,

361
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,793
但是 事到如今 
but at the moment, 

362
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:14,480
您的提议让我感激万分 费雪小姐
I would be very grateful, Miss Fisher.

363
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,640
来自我们最受欢迎的赞助商的广告
Now a word from our favourite sponsor.

364
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,640
女士们 是否只有奋力搓洗
Ladies, do you scrub your knuckles raw

365
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,280
才能让丈夫的衬衫亮白如新?
to get your husband's shirts white and bright?

366
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,760
孩子的衣服呢?
What about the kiddies?

367
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,920
是不是看上去已经像是褪色的次品一样?
Are their clothes looking faded and second-rate?

368
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:35,440
那你们真应该试一试华丽炫耀的新型洗衣粉
Well, then, you really should try new Flamboyance washing powder.

369
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,520
# 女士们 仔细听我说 #
# Ladies, listen to the news #

370
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,840
# 再也不必为周一清晨忧虑 #
# No more Monday-morning blues #

371
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,880
# 只要来一小勺华丽炫耀 #
# Just one scoop of Flamboyance #

372
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,840
# 你就可以尽情享受洗衣的快乐 #
# And through your washing day you'll dance #

373
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,360
# 华丽炫耀 华丽炫耀 #
# Flamboyance, Flamboyance #

374
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,920
# 只要来点华丽炫耀 #
# Just a little Flamboyance. #

375
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,600

见鬼!
Damn!

376
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,742
稍作休息 接下来是
A brief tune, then it's news on 

377
00:21:10,743 --> 00:21:13,440
整点阿奇伯・琼斯新闻播报
the hour with Archibald Jones.

378
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,280
弦跳出来了
Popped a string.

379
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,448
唱的真不错 费雪小姐 
But bravo, Miss Fisher. 

380
00:21:17,449 --> 00:21:19,640
我们合作无间真该多亲近些
We make a wonderful team. We should get cosy.

381
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,440
我觉得够亲近的了 谢谢您
I'm quite cosy enough, thank you.

382
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,240
哦 您好
Oh, hello.

383
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,040
需要什么帮助?
Can I help you?

384
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,160
- 晚报 - 哦
- Evening edition. - Oh.

385
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,560
路易莎的变故真太糟了 她是个好姑娘
Bloody awful, what happened to Louisa. She was a real gem.

386
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,365
告诉克莱瑞斯 报纸在这儿 
Tell Clarence his paper's here. 

387
00:21:43,366 --> 00:21:45,400
他需要它播报赛马新闻
He needs it for his racing show.

388
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,600
你好 多蒂
Hello, Dot.

389
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,080
真不错 小姐
Well done, Miss.

390
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,960
- 您听上去就像专业人士 - 谢谢
- You sounded just like the real thing. - Thank you.

391
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,960
送报员似乎特意要让克莱瑞斯
Our delivery man seemed quite particular

392
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,440
看到他的报纸 是吧?
that Clarence get his newspaper, didn't he?

393
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,720
一个赌注提示
A betting tip.

394
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,680
第六场 荣耀女孩
Race six, Glory Girl.

395
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,160
我以为那条鱼已经死了
I thought that fish was dead.

396
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,040
新买的 一个礼物
It's a new one, a present.

397
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,460
我知道奥斯沃德的死
I know how upset Mrs Creswick 

398
00:22:20,461 --> 00:22:22,840
让克里斯维奇女士很难过 所以...
was about poor Oswald, so...

399
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,920
你心肠真好
That's very kind of you.

400
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,080
这没什么的
It wasn't any trouble.

401
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,618
你真是一个好女孩 多蒂 
You really are a treasure, Dot. 

402
00:22:29,619 --> 00:22:31,320
要是没有你我都不知道该怎么办
I don't know what I'd do without you.

403
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,600
您对我也很重要 小姐
Nor I without you, Miss.

404
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,000
我刚刚听到了广播的结尾
I just heard the end of that broadcast.

405
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,520
你以为自己在做什么 费雪小姐?
What do you think you're doing, Miss Fisher?

406
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:50,640
海斯尔! 海斯尔 你能否让我解释一下
Hazel! Hazel, if you'll just let me explain.

407
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,320
是我要求费雪小姐来帮忙的
I asked Miss Fisher to step in for us.

408
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,560
这样的话 那我要谢谢您了
In that case, I suppose I should thank you.

409
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,680
不用谢
Not at all.

410
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:05,520
亲爱的 你随时可以决定是否继续参加
You can be so determined to carry on sometimes, my love.

411
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:19,720
您需要我帮你剥豆子呢 巴特勒先生?
Are you sure you don't want me to shell the peas, Mr Butler?

412
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,360
不用 我喜欢剥豆子 让我很有满足感
No, no, I enjoy podding peas. It's very satisfying.

413
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:28,320
比起晚餐来 费雪小姐更依赖于你
And Miss Fisher relies on you for a lot more than her evening meal.

414
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,640
在这儿 我们都做些力所能及的工作
We all help where we can under this roof,

415
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,440
但你可是她无时无刻都需要的得力助手啊
but you are her right-hand woman at all hours of the day and night.

416
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:40,440
是的 我努力成为她的得力助手
Yes, I try to be her Girl Friday.

417
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,880
要是我住在其它地方 就不太可能了 是吧?
But that wouldn't be possible if I lived anywhere else, would it?

418
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,520
我可不要想这个 多乐茜
Not something I even want to consider, Dorothy.

419
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:56,080
我们需要一台收音机 我们得听赛马的广播
We need the radio. We've got a date with a horserace.

420
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,160
你们可不能想用无线电了 就随意的闯进来要
Well, you can't just take over the wireless whenever you please.

421
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,360
工作要求 多蒂你看
It's a job, Dottie. Look.

422
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,081
费雪小姐要我们关注这匹马...
Miss Fisher asked us to keep an eye on this horse...

423
00:24:05,082 --> 00:24:05,920
荣耀女孩
Glory Girl.

424
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,480
我们告诉她这老马不行 整个赛季倒数第一
We told her she's a joke. That nag ran last all season.

425
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,360
好吧 那么 就听一场
Alright, then, one race,

426
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,320
但是我要警告你们 
but I warn you, 

427
00:24:13,321 --> 00:24:16,320
费雪小姐有在...警察局的朋友
Miss Fisher has company...constabulary company.

428
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:21,920
这家伙真的就在那儿 多蒂他就在赛道上
This guy is actually there, Dottie. He's at the track.

429
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,400
我赌他是在什么树上坐着
Up some bloody tree, I bet,

430
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,920
这样报业同行就不能打击报复了
so the newspapers don't lynch him for stealing their thunder.

431
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,280
罗兰德第六场的赛马已经就位
Lining up for race six in the Rowlands.

432
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,650
外圈第二道是我给你的得冠提示... 
Second on the outside is my tip for a win... 

433
00:24:32,651 --> 00:24:33,720
四号 巴德兹
No.4, Bedazzler.

434
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,000
我还以为荣耀女孩是他的最爱
I thought Glory Girl was supposed to be his favourite.

435
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,360
外道最后一匹是十四号 
Last on the outside is No.14, 

436
00:24:39,361 --> 00:24:41,560
荣耀女孩 赛道是湿路面
Glory Girl. It's a wet track here.

437
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,040
都没怎么提到这匹马
She hardly rated a mention.

438
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,484
我觉得自己是在福勒明顿的赛马
I feel like I'm at the bookie's circle 

439
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:47,280
赌博大厅里一样 小点声
at Flemington. Turn it down.

440
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,960
我们没下注真是太幸运了
You're lucky we haven't got a bet on.

441
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,417
... 生于 1926年7月7日 
..foaled on 7th July 1926, 

442
00:24:53,418 --> 00:24:55,040
她的身体状态还是非常不错
and she is still going strong.

443
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,200
- 赶紧开始啊! - 嘘!
- Just get on with it! - Ssh!

444
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,280
1926年7月7日
7th July 1926.

445
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,836
是谁告诉海斯尔・克里斯维奇 
Who told Hazel Creswick 

446
00:25:02,837 --> 00:25:04,720
我应该在歌唱圈发展的?
I should diversify into singing?

447
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,120
我不知道 但这确实是一个不错的建议
I'm not sure, but it certainly is a wonderful suggestion.

448
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,394
我拙劣的卧底表现能为
I'm glad my feeble undercover attempt 

449
00:25:11,395 --> 00:25:13,720
您提供些消遣 我很高兴
provides you with amusement.

450
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,120
我会在所有阴暗的角落里寻找乐趣 阿奇
I look for joy in all the dark places Archie.

451
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,520
有人付给克莱瑞斯・鲍尔 一大笔钱
So, someone is paying Clarence Ball large amounts of cash,

452
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,280
道奇似乎是他们的中间人
and Dodger looks like the go-between.

453
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,120
他在电台可算是如鱼得水了
He seemed quite at home letting himself into the station,

454
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,860
奇怪的是他在所有的这些
but odd that he only offered up one 

455
00:25:26,861 --> 00:25:28,440
比赛中只提供了一条提示
tip in all those races.

456
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,560
可能 "荣耀女孩"是
Perhaps 'Glory Girl'

457
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,360
下一场阴谋破坏的指令
is an instruction for the next act of sabotage.

458
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,080
"荣耀女孩"可能是指海斯尔・克里斯维奇
'Glory Girl' could be Hazel Creswick.

459
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,560
不可能!
No!

460
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,040
她赢了
She won.

461
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,800
那匹该死的老马竟然赢了四个身长
That bloody useless nag won by four lengths.

462
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,320
你好啊 波特!
Hello, Bert!

463
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,080
你们好 费雪小姐 警官
Miss Fisher. Inspector.

464
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,560
阿尔伯特
Albert.

465
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,320
荣耀女孩 赢了比赛 这是一条真实的提示
Glory Girl won that race. Definitely a genuine tip.

466
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,840
但是克莱瑞斯这家伙说的得冠热门却没有赢
Not that that Clarence bloke mentioned it on the radio.

467
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,320
一点都不挨边!
Not even close!

468
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,280
对他的神秘的马驹名誉厅节目更感兴趣了
More interested in all the fan his Hall Of Fame mystery horse.

469
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,080
或许真是条准消息
Maybe it was a real tip.

470
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,266
比起蓄意谋杀 
And the money has more to do 

471
00:26:01,267 --> 00:26:03,320
也许那笔钱和赛马有更多的联系
with the racetrack than sabotage.

472
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,114
路易莎可能在此犯了错 
Louisa may have stumbled on it 

473
00:26:05,115 --> 00:26:06,600
所以付出了生命的代价
and paid the price.

474
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,200
我会安排休斯把他们引进来
I'll have Hugh haul both of them in.

475
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,800
那么 道奇 你的真实姓名是约翰・洛克海特
So, Dodger, your real name is John Lockhart.

476
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,360
你和那个臭名昭著的驯马师 恶棍头
Any relation to Neddy Lockhart,

477
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,200
尼德・洛克海特是什么关系?
notorious racehorse trainer and standover man?

478
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,920
他是我的叔叔 怎么了?
He's my uncle. So what?

479
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,560
荣耀女孩 你在报纸上圈了这匹马的名字
Glory Girl, a horse you circled in the newspaper,

480
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,680
今天在第六场比赛里以二十比一的赔率赢了
came in for a win at 20-1 in race six today.

481
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,200
也许你们应该和你叔叔尼德谈一谈
Perhaps we should talk to your Uncle Ned about that.

482
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,314
他和此事无关 
He's got nothing to do with it. 

483
00:26:32,315 --> 00:26:34,360
我只不过是耳听八方而已
I just keep my ear to the ground.

484
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,400
要是你不希望我们去找拜访一下他的话
If you don't want us to pay him a visit,

485
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,146
就把所有关于克莱瑞斯・鲍尔
tell us everything you know about Clarence Ball 

486
00:26:38,147 --> 00:26:39,360
和他的勾当的事情都告诉我们
and his involvement.

487
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,920
我透露些消息给克拉瑞 他把他们广播出来
I pass tips on to Clarry, he puts them on the air.

488
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,175
他有一些特别的代号 
He's got some special code. 

489
00:26:43,176 --> 00:26:44,600
赌马的人花钱就为了知道这些
Punters pay to get hold of it.

490
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,080
就这些!
That's it!

491
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,422
鲍尔先生 我们对您的
Mr Ball, we're very interested 

492
00:26:49,423 --> 00:26:52,000
每日名人堂片段很感兴趣
in your daily Hall Of Fame segment.

493
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,400
请 叫我克拉瑞就可以了
Please, call me Clarry.

494
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,960
不了 谢谢您
No, thank you.

495
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,280
那么您今日的神秘赛马 线索是什么 警员?
Now, your mystery horse today, what was the clue, Constable?

496
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,080
"生于1926年7月7日"
'Foaled 7th July 1926.'

497
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,240
字母表第七个字母 G
Seventh letter of the alphabet, G,

498
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,200
然后是七月 另外一个G 1926年
then the seventh month, another G - 1926.

499
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,760
第六场 荣耀女孩
Race six, Glory Girl.

500
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,320
非常聪明
Very clever.

501
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,040
- 所以说你经营了赛马赌场吗? - 没有
- You're running a book? - No.

502
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,560
道奇把我的代码卖给那些在报摊的赌马的人
Dodger sells my code to the punters from the newsstand,

503
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,160
比赛前我把提示广播出去
I then broadcast the tip before the race.

504
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,580
要是赌马的人想要压钱 
If punters want to put money on, 

505
00:27:23,581 --> 00:27:24,840
那就是他们自己的事儿了
that's their business,

506
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,640
道奇每天晚上给我钱 是他自己的事儿
and if Dodger pays me cash every night, that's his business.

507
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,400
- 你昨天晚上和道奇见面了吗? - 没有
- You met up with Dodger last night? - No.

508
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:35,240
昨夜的老时间他没在 他今天给我付的钱
He wasn't there at the usual time. He paid me today.

509
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,240
你们通常什么时候见面?
What time do you usually meet?

510
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:41,400
节目结束之后 大概七点
After the show, around seven.

511
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:45,520
昨天晚上我闪烁灯光作为信号让他过来
Last night I flashed the lights to signal him to come up,

512
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:50,120
但是他没来 所以我就没有等他 然后回家了
but he didn't make it, so I gave up on him and went home.

513
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:54,560
一个目击者说你卖给金乐顿一个肉桂面包
A witness told us you sold a cinnamon bun to Miss Singleton.

514
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,200
那是什么时间?
What time was that?

515
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,520
大概是六点十五
About quarter past six.

516
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,400
- 然后你做什么了? - 没什么
- What did you do after? - Not much.

517
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,160
整理了一下 锁好报摊 走回家了
Tidied up, locked the stall, walked home.

518
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,880
那你每夜和克莱瑞斯・鲍尔的见面怎么了?
What about your nightly meetings with Clarence Ball?

519
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,200
我投了点收入进去 我下了赌注
I'd spent the takings. I put some bets on.

520
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,280
我没有钱给他 所以我没去找他
I didn't have it to give to him, so I put him off.

521
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,200
你那夜后来有没有去广播站周围的地方?
Did you go anywhere near the radio station later that night?

522
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,920
没有
No.

523
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,640
我把他交给你了 警员
I'll leave him to you, Constable.

524
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:24,000
阿奇伯・琼斯晚上要带我去城里逛一逛
Archibald Jones is taking me out on the town for the evening.

525
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,120
- 你检查过她的伤口了? - 还没
- Have you seen her injuries? - No.

526
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,720
我一直忙于广播寻羊启示
I've been too busy announcing missing sheep

527
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,560
以及苹果价格
and the price of apples.

528
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,720
但是你做的很好啊 阿奇
But you do it so well, Archie.

529
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,040
法医的报告认为勒杀是死因
The Coroner's report suggests strangulation as the cause of death.

530
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,920
你有没有看到胃容物的报告?
Have you seen these notes on the stomach contents?

531
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:51,480
"报纸 死者的胃里还发现了一些碎纸片"
'Newspaper. Shreds found in the victim's mouth as well.'

532
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,680
第五页 准确的来讲
Page 5, to be precise.

533
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:03,240
我们的报纸小贩看上去真是越来越可疑了
Our newspaper seller is looking more and more interesting.

534
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:08,960
或者是路易莎有些奇怪的饮食习惯
Or Louisa had strange dietary habits.

535
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,520
克莱瑞斯说她经常工作到很晚 会买点东西吃
Clarence said she often worked late and bought something to eat.

536
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,760
除了这个不普通的叉子 你看
Except this is no ordinary fork. Look

537
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,640
可能是在柜子里被夹住了
Could have been caught in a drawer.

538
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,200
这太平了
It's too even.

539
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,280
这个叉子被特意修改过
This fork has been especially modified.

540
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,760
干什么用的?
For what?

541
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,920
我们该回播音室查查
We'll have to return to the studio to find out.

542
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,345
下次要非法闯入的时候记得提醒我带上你 
Remind me to bring you on my next break-in. 

543
00:29:34,346 --> 00:29:35,200
你真的很有用
You're really quite useful.

544
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,200
多谢 
Thank you.

545
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,040
抱歉 我刚只是想扶稳你
Sorry. I was just trying to steady you.

546
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,880
探长 想什么时候扶稳我都行
Steady me anytime, Inspector.

547
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,400
这看起来有希望
This looks hopeful.

548
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,120
更多的赛马泄密?
More racing tips?

549
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,840
体育版没有什么线索
Nothing in the sports pages.

550
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,120
停 停 这有一页不见了
Stop, stop. There's a page missing.

551
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,560
准确地说 第五页
Page 5, to be precise.

552
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,320
很显然路易莎故意把这报纸藏起来
Louisa obviously had this well hidden for a reason.

553
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,880
无论是谁看到这张报纸...
Whoever she confronted with it...

554
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:28,160
就会让路易莎食言
Made her eat her words.

555
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,080
快! 杰克 
Quick, Jack!

556
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,000
跟丢了
Lost him.

557
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:20,840
看 这和我昨天在犯罪现场发现的空烟盒一样
Look, same as the empty pack I found at the crime scene yesterday.

558
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,880
- 看看这盖子 - 道奇
- Look at the lid. - Dodger.

559
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,120
我见他在报刊亭就拿着一样的烟盒
I saw him with the same pack at the newsstand.

560
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,400
他就是我们要找的纵火犯
Looks like he's our arsonist.

561
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,640
查了一个星期那个狡猾角色的线索
A week of tips like this from that dodgy character,

562
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,800
想想那钱够我们买多少啤酒
think how many beers that's going to buy us.

563
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,880
别提啤酒了 我们会有钱买下整个鲁迪酒吧
Forget the beer. We'll be rich enough to buy the whole Ruddy pub.

564
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:47,080
你觉得这是怎么回事? 顾客要在这里等
How do you like that? Customers could be waiting.

565
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,600
你们俩在这干什么?
What are you two doing here?

566
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,680
买报纸 这不违法吧
Buying a paper. No law against that.

567
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,160
- 洛克哈特在哪? - 谁?
- Where's Lockhart? - Who?

568
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,120
约翰・洛克哈特 人们叫他道奇
John Lockhart. People call him Dodger.

569
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,080
没听过
Never heard of him.

570
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,920
喔 他在这!
Oi, he's in here!

571
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,800
纵火现场到处都是黑指纹
There were black fingerprints all over the site of the fire

572
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,960
门上 箱子上 新闻纸上
the door, the bin. It's newsprint.

573
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,800
确认是约翰 '道奇' 洛克哈特的
Confirmed as John 'Dodger' Lockhart.

574
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,560
看起来你找到了破坏者
Looks like you found your saboteur.

575
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:25,000
阿奇 你终于暴露了
You can finally blow your cover, Archie.

576
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,880
但是谁谋杀了道奇?
But who murdered Dodger?

577
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:27,893
为什么? 
And why? 

578
00:32:27,894 --> 00:32:29,600
如果有另一个凶手逍遥法外
If there's another killer at large,

579
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,760
那可能不是道奇杀了路易莎
perhaps Dodger didn't kill Louisa.

580
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,240
我怀疑他那晚在播音室
I suspect he was there that night at the radio station.

581
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:38,600
我同意 你说道奇知道 路易莎正要回播音室
I agree. You said Dodger knew Louisa was heading back to the radio station

582
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,480
如果在遇到克莱瑞斯之前
If he waited to check the coast was clear

583
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,680
他是在等待作案时机
before his meeting with Clarence,

584
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:46,040
他很可能目击了凶手而不是作案
he could have witnessed a murder rather than committed one.

585
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,840
而现在他付出了代价
And now he's paid the price.

586
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,320
还有这...
And this...

587
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,200
是属于海斯尔・克里斯维奇的
belongs to Hazel Creswick.

588
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,040
我昨天就认出来了
I recognise it from yesterday.

589
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,240
她可能没有看起来的那么无助
She may not be as helpless as she seems.

590
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,800
我仍然怀疑她可以独立完成任意一个谋杀案
I still doubt she's capable of either murder all on her own.

591
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,560
说不定两个案子都是她密谋策划的
Perhaps both the Creswicks conspired.

592
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,040
几乎可以结案了
Almost time for my finale.

593
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,600
我们等会在播音室见
I'll meet you at the radio station.

594
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:10,840
在海湾正对面可以钓到很多鱼
There's plenty of good fishing available right across the bay.

595
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,280
现在播报维多利亚的天气情况
Now for Victoria's weather.

596
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,789
一个低压气旋将于
A low system will deepen over 

597
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:17,320
今早在海湾水域加强 然后...
the Bight waters this morning, then...

598
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,520
呃 向我国北部移动并有所减弱
ah, move north of the state and weaken.

599
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,560
现在请听一段贝多芬的...
Now for some modern music from...

600
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,720
现代音乐
Beethoven.

601
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,880
阿奇 你在干什么? 你还没播报完天气
Archie, what are you doing? You didn't finish the weather.

602
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,200
就当这是我的辞呈
Consider this my resignation.

603
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,040
我是不是把水落这了? 我来...
Did I leave my water? I came up...

604
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,960
阿奇
Archie.

605
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,240
你是警察
You're a policeman.

606
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,640
事实上是探长 我不是阿奇而是杰克・罗宾森
Detective Inspector, in fact. It's not Archie, it's Jack Robinson.

607
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,000
他们塞给我一个该死的警察作新闻播报员!
They passed me over as newsreader for a bloody cop!

608
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,824
现在 克里斯维奇夫妇 
Now, Mr and Mrs Creswick, 

609
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:55,640
我必须要求你同我去播音室
I must ask you to accompany me to the station

610
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,120
回答关于约翰・洛克哈特死因的一些问题
to answer questions about the death of John Lockhart,

611
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,320
也就是道奇
otherwise known as Dodger.

612
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,721
我早就告诉你那是我的 
I already told you it's mine. 

613
00:34:02,722 --> 00:34:04,760
我还纳闷是在哪丢的呢
I wondered where I'd lost it.

614
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,520
那你怎么解释它出现报刊亭里呢?
How do you explain it being found inside the newsstand?

615
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,563
我不知道 
I have no idea, 

616
00:34:08,564 --> 00:34:11,920
但我通常在接电话的时候把一个耳坠取下来
but I usually take one off when I answer the telephone.

617
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,400
你无论问谁
Ask anyone.

618
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:19,040
问吉米 他会告诉你我昨晚在哪
Ask Jimmy. He'll tell you where I was last night.

619
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,880
柯林斯?
Collins?

620
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,360
柯林斯!
Collins!

621
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,400
把克里斯维奇先生带进来
Bring Mr Creswick through.

622
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,080
他不相信我
He doesn't believe me.

623
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,280
没事 亲爱的
It's alright, my love.

624
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,480
我们昨晚一直在家
We were home all evening.

625
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:42,200
我们排练第二天的演出 吃饭 上床睡觉
We ran through our lines for the next day, ate dinner, went to bed.

626
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,920
任何人都有可能捡到海斯尔的耳坠
Anyone could have picked up Hazel's earring.

627
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,960
为什么凶手试图暗示你的妻子呢?
Why would the murderer try and implicate your wife?

628
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,440
我怎么知道?
How should I know?

629
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,240
你是一直监视着我们的优秀侦探
You're the fancy detective who's been spying on us.

630
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,060
如果你都不能查清是怎么回事 
If you can't work out what's going on, 

631
00:34:55,061 --> 00:34:56,960
那我们还有什么希望?
what hope have we got?

632
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,440
抱歉 先生
Excuse me, sir.

633
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,520
可能有你想要听的消息刚传来了
Information has just come through that you might like to hear.

634
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,160
克里斯维奇先生 请您和您妻子在外面等一下
Mr Creswick, if you'd like to wait outside with your wife.

635
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,440
吉米 我不知道今天该怎么完成表演
I don't know how I'm going to get through the show today, Jimmy.

636
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:11,560
亲爱的 我们会成功的 我们一直都是
We'll manage, my darling. We always do.

637
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:15,320
费雪小姐 你没有抛弃我们俩个 对吧?
You haven't abandoned us two, have you, Miss Fisher?

638
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,365
你们今天还会演格温妮亚? 
You will still play Guinevere today? 

639
00:35:17,366 --> 00:35:19,000
无论如何我都不会错过的
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

640
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,120
验尸官打电话来证实
The Coroner telephoned to confirm

641
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,337
最新的受害者是被粗钢丝勒死的 
the latest victim was strangled with heavy wire, 

642
00:35:27,338 --> 00:35:28,560
可能是钢琴丝
possibly piano wire.

643
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,480
克莱瑞斯昨天在播音室弄断了一根钢琴丝
Clarence broke a piano wire at the station yesterday.

644
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,080
那怎么解释耳坠的事?
How do you explain the earring?

645
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,800
试图陷害海斯尔?
An attempt to frame Hazel?

646
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,000
她和克莱瑞斯毫无感情
There was no love lost between her and Clarence.

647
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,680
当我们找到丢了的第五页或许会更了解这件事
Perhaps we'll know more when we find our missing page 5.

648
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,120
柯林斯 查一下档案
Check with Archives, Collins.

649
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,720
多蒂 你终于来了
Oh, Dot. Good.

650
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,840
我尽快赶来了 要我做些什么?
I came as fast as I could. What did you need me to do?

651
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,320
我要去直播了
I'm due on air.

652
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,560
我需要你帮我把更多的证据送去警察局给休斯
I need you to take more evidence to the police station for Hugh

653
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,360
我还要讲述特苏坎越轨的行为
while I recount my Tuscan escapades.

654
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,920
可怜的奥斯沃德二世
Poor Oswald II.

655
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,840
克里斯维奇会被吓坏的
Mrs Creswick will be devastated.

656
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,190
是的 一条死了的金鱼是不幸的 
Yes. One dead goldfish is unfortunate 

657
00:36:11,191 --> 00:36:12,680
但两条就是谋杀
but two points to foul play.

658
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,520
费雪小姐想让警察局化验所
Miss Fisher would like the police laboratory

659
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,120
检查一下水质和奥斯沃德
to test the water and Oswald.

660
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,600
为什么?
For what?

661
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,280
她觉得有人在奥斯沃德的水里放了什么东西
She thinks someone might have put something in his water.

662
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:34,480
宠物店的人让我把鱼缸清理干净 但我忘记了
The man at the pet store told me to clean his bowl out, but I forgot.

663
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,480
啊 多蒂 这不是你的错
Aw, Dottie. It's not your fault.

664
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,480
休斯 不是那样
It's not that, Hugh.

665
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,760
呆在这 我去取个测水质的瓶子
Stay here. I'll get a jar to test the water.

666
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,720
- 我会回来的 - 不是关于鱼的事
- I'll be back. - It's not about the fish.

667
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,480
是我们俩
It's about us.

668
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,120
我不知道这意味着什么
I didn't think what it would mean.

669
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,920
啊?
What?

670
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,080
婚姻 一场婚礼
Marriage, a wedding.

671
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,840
休斯 我想和你在一起 真的
I want to be with you, Hugh, I do,

672
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,560
但我也想为费雪小姐工作
but I want to work for Miss Fisher too.

673
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:03,200
那不行的 你工作的话
Well, that wouldn't be right, you working,

674
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,000
就不能当休斯・柯林斯太太了
not when you're Mrs Hugh Collins.

675
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,200
我知道
I know.

676
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,440
多蒂 你在做什么?
Dottie, what are you doing?

677
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,640
我不知道我想要什么
I don't know what I want.

678
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,160
这是什么?
What is this?

679
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,200
不!
No!

680
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,200
多蒂 等一下 多蒂!
Dottie, wait. Dottie!

681
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,240
柯林斯 怎么了?
What's going on, Collins?

682
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,800
呃...
Ah...

683
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,320
长官 又发生一起谋杀案
we've had another murder, sir.

684
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,480
我是说 威廉姆斯小姐
I meant, Miss Williams.

685
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:37,280
我一直在想 什么时候可以和多蒂确定婚期 
I always thought, sir, that when Dottie and I set a date,

686
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,040
假设她同意的话 她可以不再为费雪小姐工作
assuming she agreed, she'd stop working for Miss Fisher

687
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,040
和我一起组建家庭
and make a home for us both.

688
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,200
我以为她会很乐意
I thought she'd be happy to.

689
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,680
但现在她好像不愿意放弃工作
But now it seems that she doesn't want to stop working,

690
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,480
而她也不高兴
and she's not happy.

691
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,400
柯林斯 你所经历的
What you're experiencing, Collins,

692
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,680
是追求一个现代女性的矛盾
is the paradox of pursuing a modern woman.

693
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,920
多蒂是一位现代女性?
Dottie's a modern woman?

694
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:06,520
她和一位现代女性住了一段时间 近朱者赤
She's been living with one for a while. It's bound to rub off.

695
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,880
首先 瓦乐瑞很可爱
At first, Valerio was lovely,

696
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:13,280
但接着他把我锁在特苏坎城堡底下的地牢里
but then he locked me in a dungeon under his Tuscan castle.

697
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,720
幸运的是 我成功说服了侍卫
Fortunately, I managed to persuade the guard

698
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,880
把我从秘密通道里偷送出来
to smuggle me out through a secret passage.

699
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:23,760
哦 我的女儿多么勇敢 对吧? 乌苏拉
Oh, my. How brave our daughter is. Don't you agree, Ursula?

700
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:29,240
我不会说她勇敢 但她很有胆量又足智多谋
I wouldn't say brave. Plucky, maybe. Resourceful.

701
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,400
那不是一个安全的地牢
It wasn't a very secure dungeon,

702
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:39,640
我不知道该不该告诉你们那侍卫的一切
and I'm not sure that I should tell you everything about the guard.

703
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,960
格温妮亚 有你在我们就放心了
Guinevere, we are truly relieved to have you...

704
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:50,280
呃 亲爱的 我们非常感激
Well, my dear, we are very grateful

705
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,040
你能安然无恙地回来 
to have you home again, safe and sound.

706
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:56,280
喝杯茶庆祝一下吧
Perhaps a cup of tea to celebrate.

707
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,840
还有...
And...

708
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,680
唱支歌!
a song!

709
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:05,200
你怎么不告诉我你不舒服?
Why didn't you tell me you were so ill?

710
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,720
不 吉米 我只是太紧张了
I'm not, Jimmy. It's just nerves.

711
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,960
谢谢你 费雪小姐 我会送她回家
Thank you, Miss Fisher. I'll take her home.

712
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,640
医生会在那帮她治疗的
The doctor can see her there.

713
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:16,560
算了吧 我不需要看医生 我要播报完天气
No, please. I don't need a doctor. I need to finish the broadcast.

714
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,520
不 你需要 走吧
No, you don't. Come on.

715
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,720
你听广播没 多蒂?
Did you hear the broadcast, Dot?

716
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,960
庞静赫尔家今天又草草收尾了
The Polkinghorns came to another abrupt ending today.

717
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,440
我听了 小姐
Yes, Miss.

718
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,640
你这是怎么了?
What on earth is the matter?

719
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,640
休斯向我求婚了
Hugh proposed.

720
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,840
他想宣布这个消息 然后我们定下婚期
He wants to announce it so we can set a date.

721
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,640
是个喜讯啊
That's wonderful news.

722
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,840
不 它不是
No, it's not.

723
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,280
如果我嫁给休斯 我就再也不能为你工作了
If I marry Hugh, I won't be able to work for you anymore.

724
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,440
噢 多蒂
Oh, Dot.

725
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:09,560
我不能再和你一起查案
I won't go on investigations with you

726
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,400
记笔记 练打字
and take notes and improve my typing

727
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:14,360
开车去兜风
and go motoring with you in the Hispano.

728
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,000
多蒂 你讨厌坐我的车
Dot. You hate motoring with me.

729
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,941
没错 但是其他的我都喜欢啊 
Yes, but I love everything else, 

730
00:40:19,942 --> 00:40:20,960
那些也到此为止了
and all that will end

731
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,497
因为... 休斯想着女人
because... that's the way 

732
00:40:23,498 --> 00:40:25,280
结婚后在家相夫教子
Hugh sees it,

733
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,920
传统思想中女人的宿命 小姐
and that's the way things are for married women, Miss.

734
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:33,640
那不代表所有女人都得如此
That doesn't mean that's the way things have to stay.

735
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:47,000
特件 - 路易莎的最后一餐
Special delivery - Louisa's last meal.

736
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,440
谢谢 杰克
Thank you, Jack.

737
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,280
我开始怀念阿奇・琼斯了
I think I'm going to miss Archie Jones.

738
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,880
你自己起的那名? 和你的金领带挺配的
Did you choose that name yourself? It did suit your gold tie.

739
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,360
你就看第五版吧
Just look at page 5.

740
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:07,040
出生 丧亲 艾尔伍德走失了只博美犬
Births. Bereavements. A lost Pomeranian in Elwood.

741
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,280
这版对路易莎来说有什么特殊意义?
What made this page so special to Louisa?

742
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:13,120
柯林斯说威廉姆斯小姐可能会发现点蛛丝马迹
Collins suggested Miss Williams might have more luck.

743
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,840
真的吗? 我马上给她
Really? I'll give it to her immediately.

744
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:19,800
多蒂最近一直垂头丧气的
Dot has been rather upset lately.

745
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,520
休斯还没告诉你 是吗?
Hugh hasn't spoken to you, has he?

746
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,920
他确实要我给点建议
He did seek my advice, yes.

747
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,280
你怎么和他说的?
And what did you tell him?

748
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:34,240
那个我觉得 是内部机密
That, I believe, is confidential police information.

749
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,720
就像这个
Like this.

750
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:43,800
两条金鱼的死因 - 铊 用于制作灭鼠药
Cause of death of two goldfish - thallium. It's found in rat poison.

751
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,200
无色无味融于水
Odourless, colourless and dissolves in water.

752
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:50,000
海斯尔喝了大量的水 铊也会引起脱发
Hazel drinks a great deal of water. Thallium also causes hair loss.

753
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,000
需要控制在低剂量才能使受害者只脱发
It would have to be a low dose for the victim to lose their hair,

754
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,440
而不致命
otherwise they just die.

755
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,460
所以海斯尔是被下药了 
So Hazel is being poisoned, 

756
00:41:56,461 --> 00:41:58,320
小心谨慎 一次又一次?
slowly and carefully?

757
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,960
投毒者惯用伎俩
The poisoner's poison.

758
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,120
小姐!
Miss!

759
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,920
小姐 找到了! 我发现线索了
Miss, I found it! I found the clue.

760
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:09,400
- 这不可能只是巧合 - 从头说 多蒂
- It can't just be a coincidence. - From the beginning, Dot.

761
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,120
公告 悼念 这儿
Public Notices, In Memoriam. Here.

762
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,947
"雷德巴斯, 格温妮亚 
"Redpath, Guinevere. 

763
00:42:15,948 --> 00:42:17,840
生于1895卒于1925年
1895 - 1925.

764
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,360
在巴斯惨遭杀害 沉痛悼念 
Sadly missed. Tragically killed in Perth.

765
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:25,760
因主播暮光旋律为大众铭记
Fondly remembered for her Twilight Melodies broadcast.

766
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,240
法网恢恢疏而不漏"
Justice will prevail."

767
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,920
格温妮亚是路易莎在庞静赫尔家里用的名字
Guinevere was the name Louisa used in The Polkinghorns.

768
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,760
路易莎在巴斯住了一年
Louisa lived in Perth for a year.

769
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,634
她可能知道点格温妮亚的事 
She could have known this Guinevere. 

770
00:42:33,635 --> 00:42:35,480
但是为什么她要把报纸藏起来?
But why would she hide this notice?

771
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:45,560
克里斯维奇小姐请进 谢谢
Mrs Creswick. Come in. Thank you.

772
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,760
海斯尔 你看起来不太好
Hazel, you're not well.

773
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,520
你再替我主播一次行吗 费雪小姐?
Please will you fill in again for me, Miss Fisher?

774
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,960
你能看出来 我撑不住 
I'm not up to it, as you can see.

775
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,800
进客厅来
Come into the parlour.

776
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,040
看好她
Make sure she stays here.

777
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:08,080
我叫休斯搜索下格温妮亚・雷德巴斯的资料
I'll have Hugh hunt up the file on Guinevere Redpath.

778
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,320
我很乐意再帮你一次忙 海斯尔
I'm happy to help you out again, Hazel,

779
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,360
但前提是我必须送你送医院
but only if you let me take you to hospital as soon as I'm done.

780
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,880
我想你不知道自己病得多严重
I'm not sure you realise how ill you are.

781
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,720
不 我很好
No. I'm alright.

782
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,200
我不得不好
I have to be.

783
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:29,440
下周我就要开始新工作了
I'm moving to start my new job next week.

784
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:35,240
那张去悉尼的票 不是路易莎的 是你的
That ticket to Sydney, it wasn't Louisa's, it was yours.

785
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:38,200
新国家广播台
The new National Broadcasting Service,

786
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,600
他们从全国各地召集播音员
they're gathering presenters

787
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,120
选中了我
from all around the country, and they want me.

788
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:45,320
真光荣 祝贺你
That's quite an honour. Congratulations.

789
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,200
但是我不能突然离开3Jh
But I couldn't leave 3JH in the lurch,

790
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:51,040
所以我训练路易莎来接手
so I was training Louisa to take over.

791
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,400
她给我订好票
She booked the ticket for me.

792
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,820
海斯尔 你听说过巴斯的
Hazel, have you ever heard of a 

793
00:43:55,821 --> 00:43:58,080
格温妮亚・雷德巴斯么?
Guinevere Redpath from Perth?

794
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:02,240
或者暮光旋律? 这是个电台节目
Or Twilight Melodies? It's a radio show.

795
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,080
没有 你可以去我们的档案室查查

796

路易莎负责整理归类

797
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:12,520
多蒂 照顾好海斯尔 到时间广播了

802
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,160
- 警局调查结果呢? - 不确定 先生
- Police inquiry? - Inconclusive, sir.

803
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:31,640
他们五年了也没有找到死者的丈夫协助调查
They were never able to interview her husband of five years,

804
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,880
哈瑞・雷德巴斯先生 一个无线电技术员
a Mr Harry Redpath, a wireless technician.

805
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,800
哈瑞・雷德巴斯杀害他妻子的可能性很大
Harry Redpath could have killed his wife,

806
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:38,000
搭火车逃往墨尔本 再改名换姓
caught a train to Melbourne, changed his name.

807
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,240
你觉得是他杀了路易莎・金乐顿 先生?
You think he's Louisa Singleton's killer, sir?

808
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:42,800
也是给海斯尔・克里斯维奇下毒的人
And Hazel Creswick's poisoner.

809
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,458
为什么你不告诉克里斯维奇先生
Why haven't you told Mr Creswick 

810
00:45:08,459 --> 00:45:09,840
这个工作的事情?
about the job opportunity?

811
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,880
这么大一个喜讯
It's such exciting news.

812
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:15,120
威廉姆斯小姐 你有没有爱一人至深 
Miss Williams, have you ever loved a man so much

813
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,040
为他牺牲自由也在所不惜?
you'd sacrifice your freedom?

814
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,000
我所知电台的一切都是吉米教的
Jimmy taught me everything I know about radio.

815
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,000
他造就了我 他爱我
He made me and he adores me,

816
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,080
但他从不给我独当一面的机会
but he won't let me do anything on my own.

817
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:30,560
他不给我一分钱 不允许我驾驶
He won't let me have any money, he won't let me drive

818
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:33,240
也不准离开他寸步
or go anywhere without him.

819
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,400
我快窒息了
I feel like I'm suffocating.

820
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:41,680
接下来能播这个么? 特殊要求
Could you play this next? Special request.

821
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,320
我能提个特殊要求作报偿么?
Do I get one in return?

822
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:46,480
省省吧 克拉瑞 我对你一点兴趣也没有
Save your breath, Clarry. Your charms are lost on me.

823
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:47,960
骗人
Liar.

824
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,680
现在是特殊播报
And now, a very special treat.

825
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:59,840
一起回顾过去 - 暮光旋律
A taste of the past - Twilight Melodies.

826
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,600
晚上好 音乐发烧友们
Good evening, music lovers.

827
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,494
欢迎来到暮光旋律 
Welcome to Twilight Melodies 

828
00:46:11,495 --> 00:46:14,000
这里是哈瑞和格温・雷德巴斯
with Harry and Gwinny Redpath.

829
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:15,560
吉米!
Jimmy!

830
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,840
我妻子呢 费雪小姐?
Where is my wife, Miss Fisher?

831
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,720
我不知道
I have no idea.

832
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,240
她最好快点来
She'd better be here soon.

833
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:49,320
可能是毒药害她慢吞吞的
Perhaps the poison slowed her down.

834
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:52,400
被路易莎发现了 是吗 哈瑞?
Louisa found you out, didn't she, Harry?

835
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:56,960
在巴斯的那段时间 她记住了你的声音
Remembered your voice from her time in Perth.

836
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:00,560
接着格温妮亚的悼念公告又唤醒了她的记忆
And then Guinevere's memorial notice jogged her memory.

837
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,840
她用了格温妮亚的名字 观察你的反应
She put Guinevere's name into the script to see how you'd react

838
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,640
然后播放旧时录音以确认
and ordered that old recording just to make sure.

839
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:10,400
海斯尔来之前你哪也不准去
You're not going anywhere until Hazel gets here.

840
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,080
- 我现在就要见她 - 为什么
- I want her now. - Why,

841
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:16,040
你就能像杀了第一任妻子一样杀了她?
so you can kill her like you killed your first wife?

842
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,320
- 安静 - 你不会对我开枪
- Be quiet. - You're not going to shoot me.

843
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:20,040
那有意义吗?
What would be the point in that?

844
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,960
我去报警
I'm calling the police.

845
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:24,440
你把犯头疼的妻子独自留在家中
You left your wife at home with her headache

846
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:26,200
自己去了颁奖晚会
before you went to the awards night.

847
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:29,480
先生 多蒂打电话来 费雪小姐有麻烦了
Sir, Dot's on the telephone. Miss Fisher's in trouble.

848
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:34,120
你回到工作室再次投毒
You came back here to the studio to poison her again

849
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,800
但是被路易莎抓了个现形
but Louisa caught you in the act.

850
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,880
是你
It's you.

851
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:11,040
你把她的尸体运走
You dragged her body outside.

852
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:14,120
克莱瑞斯毫无所觉
Clarence couldn't hear any of it.

853
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:18,760
接着你若无其事地去参加颁奖晚会
Then you continued on to the awards night as if nothing had happened,

854
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,040
可怜的老道奇目睹了一切
and poor old Dodger saw it all.

855
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,923
你意识到他看到了案发过程 
You realised he witnessed the murder, 

856
00:48:23,924 --> 00:48:25,600
所以你把他也杀了
so you killed him too.

857
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:30,480
海斯尔走进这扇门前 你不准动
You're not moving until Hazel walks through that door.

858
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,776
她违抗了我 如果我不能拥有她 
She defied me, and if I can't have her, 

859
00:48:33,777 --> 00:48:35,240
没有人能够拥有
no-one will.

860
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,600
我要杀了她
I will kill her.

861
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:46,800
也包括你 费雪小姐
And I'll kill you too, Miss Fisher.

862
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,960
你做了什么?
What have you done?

863
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:59,440
你的下场会和路易莎一样
You'll get the same as Louisa.

864
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,760
费雪小姐?
Miss Fisher?

865
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:32,200
观赏愉快 杰克
Hope you enjoyed the show, Jack.

866
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:37,400
- 警官  - 拉他起来
- Constable, - get him up.

867
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,080
哈瑞・雷德巴斯 现以蓄意杀害
Harry Redpath, you're under arrest

868
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,960
格温妮亚・雷德巴斯之罪逮捕你
for the murders of Guinevere Redpath,

869
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:50,360
还有路易莎・金乐顿和约翰・洛克海特
Louisa Singleton and John Lockhart.

870
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:53,760
加上谋杀海斯尔・克里斯维奇未遂
And the attempted murder of Hazel Creswick.

871
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:00,000
你不用着急赶来
You took your time.

872
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:15,320
想要恢复原样了吗?
Might want to put this back on?

873
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,840
可我们怎么解决那些问题?
But how will we solve everything?

874
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,600
这是个悖论 多蒂- 让时间去解决一切
It's a paradox, Dottie - a problem that takes time to solve,

875
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:25,080
对我来说是时候了解现代女性了
time for me to understand the modern woman.

876
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,960
和我恋爱长跑 你开心么?
So you're happy for a long engagement, then?

877
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:29,440
我很开心
I'm happy.

878
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:32,840
我也是
Me too.

879
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,040
我想要敬杯酒
I would like to propose a toast.

880
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:45,320
你也是 巴特勒先生 请满上
You too, Mr Butler. I insist.

881
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:52,360
敬两位我最亲爱的人
To two of the dearest people I know.

882
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:56,280
敬多蒂 我强大的靠山 左膀右臂
To Dot, my Rock of Gibraltar, my strong right hand.

883
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,680
当然 还有休斯
And, of course, to Hugh,

884
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:04,960
即使沉静也有让人无法抵抗的警官魅力
that purveyor of quiet yet irresistible constabulary charm.

885
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,760
敬多蒂和休斯
To Dot and Hugh.

886
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:12,400
多蒂和休斯
Dot and Hugh.

887
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,880
B先生
Mr B.

888
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,800
阿奇 看样子回归你的旧生活了
So, Archie, looks like it's back to your old life

889
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,680
别为我停下
Don't stop because of me.

890
00:51:56,200 --> 00:52:00,880
# 我们都是形单影只的 #
We're all alone, no chaperone

891
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,880
# 成为我们中的一员 #
Can get our number

892
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,440

# 你身上有股狂热 孩子 #
There's something wild about you, child

895
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,360
# 如此动人心弦 #
That's so contagious

896
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:22,160
# 让我们离经叛道 #
Let's be outrageous

897
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,400
# 让我们随心所欲 #
Let's misbehave

898
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,760
# 你懂我是真心的 #
You know my heart is true

899
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:31,360
#你说过关心我#
And you say you for me care

900
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:33,480
#一定有人会说#
Somebody's sure to tell

901
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:37,200
# 但我们到底关心什么? #
But what the heck do we care?

902
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:41,840
# 他们说即使熊和骆驼也有爱情 #
They say that bears have love affairs and even camels

903
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,960
