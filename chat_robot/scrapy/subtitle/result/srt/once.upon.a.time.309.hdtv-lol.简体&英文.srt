00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,100
《童话镇》前情提要
Previously on "Once upon a time"...

6
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,490
你为了那把匕首的魔力  放弃了比尔菲
You traded Baelfire for the power of a dagger,

7
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:09,010
而我拿你换取了青春
and I traded you for youth.

8
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,660
我不是当父亲的料
I was never meant to be a father.

9
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,390
潘时日无多了
Pan's dying.

10
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,420
他需要用至诚之心
He needs the heart of the truest believer.

11
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,310
这是交换  亨利得死
It's a trade. Henry will die.

12
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,840
你不是碰巧找到亨利的  对吗
Your finding Henry wasn't an accident, was it?

13
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,800
不明白你在说什么
Whatever do you mean?

14
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,790
你从哪找到他的
Where did you get him?

15
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,120
咒语都可以被打破
All curses can be broken.

16
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,450
他们的孩子就是解咒的关键
Their child is the key.

17
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:27,550
强大的力量需要足够的牺牲
Great power requires great sacrifice.

18
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,060
告诉我什么样的心脏能达到要求
Tell me, what will suffice?

19
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,500
你最珍爱的东西的
The heart of the thing you love most.

20
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,670
诅咒来了
The curse! It's here!

21
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,750
我在等着呢
I'm waiting!

22
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:55,480
怎么这么久才来  宝贝儿
What took you so long, dearie?

23
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,460
你知道原因的
You know what took so long.

24
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,930
是啊  诅咒
Oh, yes. The curse.

25
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,170
你做到了
You did it.

26
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,620
对
That's right.

27
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:06,120
我做到了
I did it.

28
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,680
而我想告诉你
And I wanted you to know it.

29
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:12,840
免得你忘记一切
Before you, like all the pathetic denizens

30
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,480
就像这片悲惨土地上的可怜居民一样
of this wretched land, forgets everything.

31
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,640
你感觉怎么样
How did it feel?

32
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:20,490
看见咒语生效吗
Watching the curse cloud form?

33
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,140
感觉像是胜利
Felt like victory.

34
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:24,860
杀了你最爱的人
How did it feel

35
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,800
感觉怎么样
to kill the thing you love most?

36
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,090
取出你父亲的心脏
Ripping the heart out of your father.

37
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:30,770
感觉怎么样
How did that feel?

38
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:32,990
这是诅咒的代价
It was the price of the curse.

39
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,490
我的感受并不重要
How it felt doesn't matter.

40
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:37,310
他会明白的
He would've understood.

41
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,370
我夺回了属于我的生活
I took my life back.

42
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,700
我必须这样
I had to.

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,160
我赢了
I won.

44
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:52,090
但你来了这里  来幸灾乐祸了
And yet, here you are, feeling the need to gloat.

45
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,440
少了点什么  对吧  宝贝儿
Something's missing, isn't it, dearie?

46
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,370
才没有
Not at all.

47
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,090
我拥有想要的一切
I have everything I want.

48
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,800
没有什么能阻止我了
Nothing can stop me now.

49
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,460
并非如此
Not quite.

50
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,080
你什么意思
What does that mean?

51
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,390
救世主
The savior.

52
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,950
白雪公主和白马王子的孩子
The child of Snow White and Prince Charming.

53
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,510
她能阻止你
She can stop you.

54
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,460
她能打破诅咒
She can break the curse.

55
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,400
看来除掉一个孩子
Well, it looks like getting rid of a baby

56
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:21,670
列入了我的任务清单
just made my to-do list.

57
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,050
当然啦
Of course it did.

58
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,620
但就算你成功了
But even if you succeed with that,

59
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,830
你还有一个更大的问题
you have an even bigger problem.

60
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,960
你的内心有个洞
Now there's a hole... in your heart.

61
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,180
有一天
And someday,

62
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,620
你会找我来填满它的
you will come to me to fill it.

63
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,880
你高估了你预见的能力
You overestimate your powers of foresight.

64
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,710
你低估了你做的事需要的代价
And you underestimate the price of what you've done!

65
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,420
*你会看见  你会来找我*
*You shall see, you will come to me

66
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,210
*你还需要更多*
*There is more you need, oh!*

67
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,430
嘲弄我对你没好处的
Your taunts will get you nowhere.

68
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,440
我太了解你了
I know you too well.

69
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,990
你想做另一笔交易
You wanna make another deal.

70
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,170
我不想
Well, I won't.

71
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,300
交易
A deal?

72
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,950
你已答应我  让我在这片新土地过上安逸的生活
You've already promised me a good life in this new land.

73
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,110
我还会向你要求什么呢
What more can I want from you?

74
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:13,490
离开这牢笼
Oh, to be... let out of this cage?

75
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:17,680
取消我们最后一次交易
To... be let out of our last deal?

76
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,840
逃脱诅咒
To escape the curse?

77
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,550
我为什么要那样呢  宝贝儿
But why would I desire that, dearie?

78
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,300
我就想待在这里
I'm exactly where I want to be.

79
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,550
天啊  他昏迷了吗
Oh, god. Is he unconscious?

80
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,120
亨利  能听见我们吗
Henry, can you hear us?

81
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,100
他的心脏到了潘身上  就昏迷了
He passed out as soon as his heart went into Pan.

82
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,200
他还有呼吸吗
Is he breathing?

83
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,360
撑住  孩子
Just hang in there, buddy.

84
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,380
你对他做了什么
What the hell'd you do to him?

85
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:53,180
我什么也没做  艾玛
Oh, I didn't do anything, Emma.

86
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:54,660
是亨利
It was Henry.

87
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,180
他自愿把心脏给我的
He offered me his heart of his own free will.

88
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,430
我要夺回来
I'm gonna take it back from you.

89
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,630
我觉得你没这种能力
I don't think you have it in you.

90
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,030
朗普斯金就没有
Rumplestiltskin didn't.

91
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:09,670
你怎么会有呢
Why should you?

92
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,810
他在哪里
Where is he?

93
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,850
-你做了什么  -他在这个盒子里
- What did you do? - Why, he's right in this box,

94
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,860
完整无损  也不会碍事了
safe and sound and out of the way.

95
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:19,700
不幸的是  他没法再伤害我了
Unfortunately for you, he can't hurt me anymore.

96
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,910
你也不能
And neither can you.

97
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,870
真的吗
Really?

98
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,830
你觉得怎么样
How did that feel?

99
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,440
你在挠我痒痒吧
Like a tickle.

100
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:36,840
他怎么样
How is he?

101
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,970
你会没事的  亨利
You're gonna be all right, Henry.

102
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,390
我们会带你回家的
We're gonna get you home.

103
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:48,280
十一年前

104
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,790
你想见我吗
You, um, you wanted to see me?

105
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,380
没错
Yes, I did.

106
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,780
如果是关于鹏哥的养狗证的事
All right, well, if this is about Pongo's dog license,

107
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,590
应该还在办理
I-I believe it's still up-to-date.

108
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,890
跟你的狗无关
This has nothing to do with your dog.

109
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,700
镇长女士  你没事吧
Madame mayor, are you all right?

110
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,660
我很好
I'm okay.

111
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:05,180
恕我直言  你看起来并不好
Excuse me for saying so, but you don't seem okay.

112
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,560
我无法忍受你说话这么直
I don't tolerate that sort of bluntness.

113
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,730
我可是皇...
I'm the q--

114
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:12,910
镇长
The mayor.

115
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,830
而我是治疗师
And I'm a therapist.

116
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,330
所以你才叫我来  对吧
That's--that's why you asked me here, isn't it?

117
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,630
什么事困扰你  感觉如何
What's bothering you? What are you feeling?

118
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:19,620
感觉不到
Nothing.

119
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,610
我什么都感觉不到
I'm feeling nothing.

120
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,330
这么说的话
If I were to guess, I would say that...

121
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,520
我觉得你是个要强的女人
you're a driven woman,

122
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,550
有时会让你内心留下空洞
and sometimes that can leave a hole.

123
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:33,960
留下什么
A what?

124
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,910
空洞  即空虚
A hole. An emptiness.

125
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,500
生活中不仅仅只有工作
There's more to life than work.

126
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,970
也许这才是你不满的原因
And maybe that's why you feel dissatisfied.

127
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,980
我没有不满
I'm not dissatisfied.

128
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,460
我爱我的生活
I love my life.

129
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,720
但没人与你分享还有什么意义
Well, what's the point if you've got no one to share it with?

130
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,640
你又太直白了
There's that bluntness again.

131
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,800
生命中有没有那么一刻
Has there ever been a time in your life

132
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,740
你没有这种感觉
when you haven't felt this way?

133
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,940
那个小男孩来的时候
When that little boy visited.

134
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:56,480
欧文
Owen.

135
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,330
是孩子
A child.

136
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,100
让你生活更有意义
That can provide so much meaning.

137
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,870
我需要一个孩子  戈登  还需要你帮忙
I need a child, Gold. And I need your help.

138
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,900
我很荣幸  但不感兴趣
Well, I'm flattered, but uninterested.

139
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,340
不是要杀了他
Not like that.

140
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:18,660
我一上午都在咨询领养站
I spent all morning talking to adoption agencies.

141
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,730
候选名单都排到两年后了
The wait-lists are over two years long.

142
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,820
但你  戈登
But you, Gold,

143
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,010
你知道如何打破陈规
you know how to cut through red tape.

144
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,640
如果有人能钻政策的空子
And if anyone can work the system

145
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,930
帮我领养个孩子  那人就是你
and find me a baby, it's you.

146
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,340
你想领养吗
You wish to adopt?

147
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,890
这有什么稀奇的
Well, don't look so surprised.

148
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,010
不稀奇
Oh, I'm not.

149
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,350
你肯定能成为
I'm sure you'll make a...

150
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,880
一位"好"母亲
well, a mother of some sort.

151
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:42,700
到底能不能帮忙
Can you help me?

152
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:43,740
当然可以
Of course I can.

153
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,840
但听我一言
But a word of caution--

154
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,690
问问你自己  你准备好领养孩子了吗
Ask yourself, is this something you're ready for?

155
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,970
不用准备好  我就是需要
It's something I need.

156
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,250
这完全是两码事
Well, that may not be the same thing.

157
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,460
我会帮你弄到孩子
I'll get you a child.

158
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,740
但孩子能否让你好过点
But whether or not that's helping you,

159
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,050
我们拭目以待
remains to be seen.

160
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:05,540
成了父母  一切都要以孩子为先
When you become a parent, you must put your child first.

161
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,790
无论发生什么
No matter what.

162
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:14,680
这保护咒
This preservation spell

163
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,530
能让他保持这个状态更久一点
can keep him in this condition for a while longer.

164
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,130
为我们找到潘争取时间
Buy us time to get to Pan.

165
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,110
你也曾是迷失男孩  知道他会去哪吗
You were a lost boy. Any idea where he went?

166
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,350
我知道他住哪里
Well, I-I mean, I know where he lived,

167
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,470
在哪里收容迷失男孩
where--his compound.

168
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:28,530
白痴  你说的我们都知道
Well, that's idiotic. We all know that.

169
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,300
你不觉得他会蠢到回到那里吗
You think he's stupid enough to go back?

170
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,940
-你真没用  -够了
- You're useless. - Okay, enough.

171
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,430
别跟我说什么够了
Don't tell me what's enough.

172
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,080
我的孩子要死了
My son is dying!

173
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,240
是我们的孩子
Our son.

174
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,620
所以我懂你的感受
So yes, I know how you feel.

175
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,630
你根本不懂我的感受
You have no idea what I feel.

176
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:46,620
你有父母  有这个...
You have your parents. You have this...

177
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:48,890
人
person,

178
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,550
还有个海盗为你着迷
a pirate who pines for you.

179
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,450
你什么都有  还告诉我
You have everything, and yet you claim

180
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:53,790
你懂我的感受
to know what I feel?

181
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,810
我只有亨利
All I have is Henry,

182
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:59,320
我不能失去他  因为他是我的全部
and I am not about to lose him, because he is everything.

183
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:04,940
你说得没错
You're right.

184
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,110
我不懂你的感受
I don't know what you feel.

185
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,870
所以你想干什么
So what do you wanna do?

186
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:11,070
你喜欢操控一切  现在来啊
You wanna the run the show? Run it.

187
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:14,450
我们怎么救亨利
How do we save Henry?

188
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,730
我不知道
I don't know.

189
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:21,930
就算找到了潘  他之前就很强大
Even if we can find Pan, he was powerful before.

190
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:22,860
有了亨利的心
With Henry's heart,

191
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,240
我们根本奈何不了他
I-I don't know if we can hurt him.

192
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,360
当然可以
Yes, we can.

193
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,680
你们看
Look.

194
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,040
你割伤他了
You nicked him.

195
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,900
他能流血  我们就能伤他
If he can bleed, we can hurt him.

196
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,730
能伤他就能杀他
And if we can hurt him, we can kill him.

197
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,920
一定要杀了他
And we will.

198
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,490
戈登在盒子里吗
Gold is in a box?

199
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:53,350
那戴维就永远都不能离开梦幻岛了
Then David can never leave the island.

200
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,500
玛丽·玛格丽特  这不重要
Mary Margaret, that doesn't matter.

201
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,010
我们已经说好了
I've already made peace with that.

202
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,220
重要是救活亨利
What matters is Henry.

203
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,550
我们有多少时间
How much time do we have?

204
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:03,240
保护咒也许只能撑一小时
Maybe an hour before the preservation spell wears off.

205
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:03,860
如果他会飞
If he's airborne,

206
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,620
他可能在岛上任何一个角落
he could be anywhere on the island.

207
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,450
一个小时不够
An hour isn't much time.

208
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,370
我建议现在就开始找
I suggest we get started looking.

209
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:12,600
他在哪里
Where is he?

210
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,560
走了
Gone.

211
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:18,160
现在为时已晚  他赢了
There's nothing you can do. He's already won.

212
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,250
潘永远不会失败
Pan never fails.

213
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:21,860
你不愿意说是吗
You won't talk?

214
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,180
那我只好逼你说了
How 'bout I make you talk?

215
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,590
瑞金娜  等等
Regina, wait.

216
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,870
没时间了
There's no time!

217
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,430
我认为严刑拷问在这里并不是最佳上策
I don't think torture is our best move here.

218
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:31,960
瞧瞧那些孩子  他们已经在地狱里走了一遭
Look at these kids. They've been to hell and back.

219
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:34,230
我们需要想点别的办法
We need to try something else.

220
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,170
试试装可爱吧
Yeah, we tried the cute and cuddly.

221
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,980
他们不会对劝说有反应的
They don't respond to reason.

222
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,880
你还有什么提议
What else do you have to offer?

223
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:43,310
每个孩子最想要的
What every kid wants.

224
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,320
是妈妈
A mother.

225
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,320
有什么消息吗
You have news?

226
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,560
有  命运也许是站在你这边的
Yes. Fate may be on your side.

227
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,410
今天早上  我和一位机构人员谈过了
This morning I, uh, spoke with an agency

228
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:01,690
他把一个凤凰城的小男孩
who had placed a baby boy from Phoenix

229
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:04,360
安置在波士顿附近一户人家里
with a family nearby in Boston.

230
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:07,040
住在一户人家里吗  命运如何
With a family? How is that fate?

231
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:09,740
因为到最后一刻  领养手续未能成行
Because at the last minute, the adoption fell through.

232
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,390
这种事总是会发生的
It happens.

233
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:15,250
所以这小婴孩需要一个家
So the baby still needs a home.

234
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,370
没错
Indeed.

235
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:19,480
正如我所说  命运似乎是站在你这边的
As I said, fate appears to be on your side.

236
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,510
领养机构在波士顿
The agency is in Boston.

237
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:30,260
米尔斯女士
Well, Ms. Mills,

238
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:33,190
你的申请好得令人难以置信
your application is almost too good to be true.

239
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,520
我是说你的推荐信无可挑剔
I mean, your references are impeccable.

240
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:38,450
而且在你所居住的这个童话镇上
And this town you live in-- Storybrooke--

241
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:39,500
你是镇长吗
You're the mayor?

242
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,260
已经第三届了  所有人都同意
Third term. All unopposed.

243
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,040
从未听说过童话镇
Never heard of Storybrooke.

244
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:47,160
那是个世外桃源
Oh, it's a... hidden gem.

245
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,370
对孩子们来说是个和平  完美的地方
Peaceful, perfect for children.

246
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,930
就像童话故事里的那样
It's like a fairy tale.

247
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,880
如果你有时间  应该去瞧瞧
You should come visit sometime.

248
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,060
我每年只有两周的假期
I get two weeks off a year.

249
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:01,220
请恕我直言  山多士有全套自助假期
And all due respect, Sandals has an inclusive buffet.

250
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,110
童话镇也有山多士吗
You got that in Storybrooke?

251
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,680
还没有
I'm afraid not.

252
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:05,870
总而言之
Anyway,

253
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,350
我已经和你解释过你的权利和责任
I've explained your rights and responsibilities,

254
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,960
但是有一项我还要具体强调一下
but there's one item I'd like to go over in detail.

255
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:14,100
这是保密收养
This is a closed adoption,

256
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,420
也就是说你永远不可能
which means you'll never be able to contact

257
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,700
联系你孩子的亲生父母
your child's birth parents.

258
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,250
信息是完全封锁的  包括父母的姓名
It's a complete information blackout-- parents' names,

259
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,950
种族  家谱记录
ethnicity, genealogical records.

260
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,660
你不会得到任何有关的信息
You won't have access to any of it.

261
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,540
我只关心我孩子的未来
I'm concerned with my child's future,

262
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,850
不关心他的过去
not his past.

263
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,910
那么恭喜你  准备好见你的儿子了吗
Well, then congratulations. You ready to meet your son?

264
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,080
准备好了
Yes!

265
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,710
你好啊
Well, hello there.

266
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:50,640
是命运对吗
It was fate, wasn't it?

267
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:52,130
亨利
Henry.

268
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:53,590
亨利吗
Henry, huh?

269
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:56,430
现在很少有人给孩子起名叫亨利了
You don't meet a lot of Henrys nowadays.

270
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,950
非常古老的名字
Very old world.

271
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,430
这是我父亲的名字
It was my father's name.

272
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,090
他不久前过世了
He passed some time ago.

273
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,510
很遗憾
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

274
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,640
但愿他走得安详
I hope it was peaceful, at least.

275
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,760
需要帮忙吗
Oh, you need some help?

276
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,240
不用了  我行的
Oh, no, no. I've got it.

277
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,800
来吧  亨利
Come on, Henry.

278
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,460
我们回家咯
Let's go home.

279
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,530
孩子们  听我说
Guys, listen to me.

280
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,620
我们不会伤害你们的
We are not gonna hurt you.

281
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:34,670
我知道你们忠于潘  我明白
I know you're loyal to Pan, and I get that.

282
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:37,430
但是你们犯了一个严重的错误
But you are making a terrible mistake.

283
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,670
长时间以来
For a long time,

284
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,660
我也以为自己再也找不到家人
I thought I was never gonna find my family.

285
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,090
我曾经是个孤儿  就和你们大家一样
I was an orphan, like all of you.

286
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,780
一个迷失的女孩
A lost girl.

287
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,740
今天使我想起  我并不是孤身一人
And I was reminded today that I am not alone,

288
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,190
我有很多爱我的人
that I have a lot of people that love me.

289
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,260
而我从未想过这一切会发生
And I never thought that was gonna happen.

290
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:00,960
如果这些能发生在我身上  你们也可以的
If that can happen to me, it can happen to you.

291
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:04,590
潘是我们唯一需要的家人
Pan is the only family we need.

292
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:07,840
不  家人不会像他这么做
No. Family doesn't do what he did.

293
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,800
潘欺骗你们  让你们干坏事
Pan lied to you and made you do terrible things.

294
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,900
他骗了亨利  说服他
He lied to Henry, and convinced him

295
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,430
交出自己的心
to give up his own heart.

296
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:15,420
来拯救这座岛
To save the island.

297
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,980
不  是为了拯救他自己
No, to save himself.

298
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:22,100
不要听她说  潘关心我们所有的人
Don't listen to her. Pan cares about all of us.

299
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,350
不  他不关心
No, he doesn't.

300
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,940
我们关心你们
We care about you.

301
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:26,690
我们能救你们
And we can save you!

302
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,120
我们可以带你们一起回家
We can take you home with us to our land.

303
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,850
不必再害怕潘
There's no reason to fear Pan anymore.

304
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:35,450
直到他从亨利心脏吸取力量
Until he absorbs the power from Henry's heart,

305
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,050
就能阻止他了
he can be stopped.

306
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:39,190
你们只需要告诉我们他在哪
You just have to tell us where he is.

307
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:43,540
趁潘还让你们活着的时候  赶紧走吧
Leave now while Pan still allows you to breathe.

308
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:46,000
这是你唯一能得到的帮助
That's the only help you'll get.

309
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:50,430
潘...在哪儿
Where... is Pan?

310
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,700
不...告诉你
Not...telling.

311
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:56,920
你真的能带我们回家吗
Can you really bring us home?

312
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,310
闭上你的嘴
Shut your mouth!

313
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,360
是的
Yes.

314
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,050
在你们的帮助下
With your help.

315
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,190
他的思考树
His thinking tree.

316
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,220
-不  -是的  思考树
- No! - Yes, his thinking tree.

317
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:07,700
闭嘴  都闭嘴
Stop it! All of you!

318
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,680
那是什么地方
What is that?

319
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:11,080
他想一个人呆着的时候就去那儿
It's where he goes when he wants to be alone.

320
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,780
你们可以在那里找到他  不远
You can find him there. It's not far.

321
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,320
不  别相信她
No, don't trust her.

322
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,750
你能告诉我们在哪儿吗
Can you tell us where that is?

323
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,360
可以
Yeah.

324
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,640
但你要发誓
But you have to swear,

325
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,560
发誓你会带我们一起走
swear that you'll take us with you.

326
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,310
我保证
I promise.

327
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,490
我们就要回家了
We are going home.

328
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:31,850
我们所有人都是
All of us.

329
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,800
这个小淘气是谁啊
Who is this bundle of joy?

330
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,680
你对他哭很不满吗
Do you have a problem with him crying?

331
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,810
不  当然不
No, of course not.

332
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:58,240
好了  该安静安静了  该安静了
Okay, it's time to be quiet. It's time to be quiet.

333
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:01,690
怎么了
What?!

334
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:03,090
需要点建议吗
You want some advice?

335
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,790
讲个故事试试吧
Try a story.

336
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,950
他们就是这么安抚自己的
That's how they soothe themselves.

337
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:10,150
睡前故事  让他们适应你的声音
A bedtime story. Gets 'em used to your voice.

338
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,050
在鲁比身上就有效
Worked with Ruby.

339
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,910
她的问题出现地比较晚
Her issues started later.

340
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,210
没事  没事的
Hey. Okay. It's okay.

341
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,150
没事的
It's okay.

342
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,330
很久很久以前  有一个...
Once upon a time, there was--

343
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:44,430
他的心脏跟火车头一样有力
Well, his heart's as strong as a locomotive.

344
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,180
他的肺也很健康  很显然
And his lungs are healthy, clearly.

345
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,620
那需不需要做个血液检测
Well, what about a blood test?

346
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,150
或者胸透
Or a chest x-ray?

347
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,350
他吸烟吗
Is he a smoker?

348
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,140
什么
What?!

349
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:56,750
听着  问题很明显
Look, it's obvious what the problem is.

350
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,910
他就是个爱哭的孩子
He's a crying baby.

351
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:00,090
我付钱就让你干这个
I paid for this?

352
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:01,320
实际上  是你的保险付的钱
Actually, your insurance did.

353
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,680
我该怎么做
What do I do?

354
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,680
我可以开点药
I can prescribe you something.

355
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,380
十毫升母亲的关爱
10 ccs of maternal love.

356
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:15,010
威尔医生  没有人爱自己的孩子胜过我
Dr. Whale, no one loves their child more than me.

357
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:17,830
也就是说我的孩子有问题
Which means there's something wrong with my son.

358
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,090
你的工作就是帮助他
Your job is to help him.

359
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:20,950
你倒是帮啊
Do it!

360
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,970
当然  我可以让他做额外的检测
Sure, I could order additional testing,

361
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:25,770
但是  婴儿做会有风险
but, uh, with babies, there are risks.

362
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,610
一般来说都是没什么也不值得做
And it's generally nothing and not worth it.

363
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,460
一般来说
"Generally"?

364
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:34,120
有些时候  可能有不正常的东西
Well, in some cases, there could be something abnormal happening.

365
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,190
但那就需要找到亲生母亲才能知道
But we'd need the birth mother to find out.

366
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,380
你是说抛弃了他的那个女人
You mean the woman who abandoned him?

367
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,510
你觉得她能安抚他
You think she can soothe him?

368
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,110
我才是他的母亲
I'm his mother.

369
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,400
你误会我了  瑞金娜
You misunderstand me, Regina.

370
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,900
如果这个孩子真的有哪里不正常
If something were in fact wrong with the baby,

371
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,830
或许他妈妈的医疗档案里有记录
maybe there's something in her medical records,

372
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:52,250
一些能引起疾病的基因方面的问题
something genetic that could be causing a problem.

373
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,800
能帮我们填补空白的
But the only people who can help us fill those blanks

374
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,360
只有亲生父母
are the biological parents.

375
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,510
但这是保密收养
But it was a closed adoption.

376
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,530
没办法联系他们
There's no way to contact them.

377
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,740
西德尼  那笔记下来
Sidney, grab a pencil.

378
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:09,600
在波士顿达特茅斯街上有家收养机构
There's an adoption agency in Boston on Dartmouth Street.

379
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,450
再说一遍  有杂音
Say again? There's noise on the line.

380
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:12,330
布兰切特女士
Ms. Blanchard.

381
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:14,030
你好
Oh. Hi.

382
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:14,890
这是谁啊
Who's this?

383
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,110
是亨利
Meet Henry.

384
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:18,640
发挥点作用
Make yourself useful.

385
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,120
达特茅斯街上的波士顿天使收养机构
Boston Angels Adoption on Dartmouth.

386
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:27,420
我需要亨利亲生母亲的名字
I need the name of Henry's biological mother.

387
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,020
这不是违反法律的吗
Isn't that against the law?

388
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,920
所以我才给你打电话  西德尼
Well, that's why I called you, Sidney.

389
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:35,230
因为我知道  为了我你会不惜一切代价
Because I know, for me, you'll do whatever it takes.

390
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,010
我一定要知道
I need this done.

391
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,480
我的儿子出了些问题
There's something wrong with my son.

392
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:41,950
他不停地...
He won't stop c--

393
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,410
哭
crying.

394
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,430
去查吧
Just--just do it.

395
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,820
-你是怎么做到的  -做到什么
- How did you do that? - Do what?

396
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,350
让他停止哭泣
M-make him stop crying.

397
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:56,540
我只是抱着他  他真可爱
Well, I'm just holding him. He's so sweet.

398
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,760
不不不
No. Oh, no, no.

399
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:08,740
抱歉  我做错什么事了吗
I'm so sorry. I--did I do something?

400
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,500
没有
No.

401
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:13,350
不  你没有  是我的问题
No, you didn't. It's me.

402
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,970
精灵森林  在那儿吗
The pixie woods? That's where it is?

403
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,100
就在北边
It's just north of here.

404
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,030
以前精灵尘就是在那里生长的
It's where the pixie dust used to grow.

405
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,140
你知道在哪儿吗
Do you know where that is?

406
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:38,620
是的  现在那里全部都荒废了
Aye. The whole region is deserted now.

407
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:41,850
好几个世纪以来  只有潘去过
No one but Pan has set foot in those woods in centuries.

408
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,200
那我们就去创造历史吧
Then let's make history.

409
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,650
你得留在这儿
We're gonna need you here.

410
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,880
一旦拿回亨利的心脏  我们得立刻回程
Once we get Henry's heart, it's gonna be a race back.

411
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,320
两边都要有人
We need help on both ends.

412
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:48,910
好
Okay.

413
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:50,200
需要我们做什么
What do you need from us?

414
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:51,750
把这些迷失男孩都集中起来
Let's gather up the lost boys.

415
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,120
全部送上海盗船
Get 'em on board the "Jolly Roger."

416
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:54,390
准备好让船起飞
Prepare the ship to fly.

417
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,340
但愿你有马羽帆
Let's hope you have a pegasus sail.

418
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,390
不然就得指望风大得能把船吹起来吧
Otherwise, we're at the mercy of the trade winds.

419
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,340
潘的影子在我们手里  它能帮我们回家
Pan's shadow's in here. It'll get us home,

420
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,700
只要你的船不散架
Long as your ship holds together.

421
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,770
只要你的计划不出差错
Well, as long as your plan holds together,

422
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,690
我的船也没问题
she will.

423
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:10,540
我会时时刻刻守在亨利身边
Henry's gonna be with me the entire time.

424
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,810
你们俩去找潘的期间
Nothing is gonna happen to him

425
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:12,750
他绝对不会出事的
while you two are away.

426
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,710
是三个人
You mean three.

427
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,940
也许我的下半辈子
I may be trapped on this island

428
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:17,890
都得在这岛上度过了
for the rest of eternity.

429
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,000
所以我绝不会错过
So if you think I'm not going to

430
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,020
这段与女儿相处的最后时光
be spending my last moments with my daughter,

431
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:22,180
别傻了
you're crazy.

432
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,470
好  上路吧
Okay. Let's do it.

433
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,370
亨利
Henry...

434
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,020
亨利  求你告诉我你究竟想要什么
Henry, I promise if you just tell me what you want,

435
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:46,370
为了你我什么都愿意做  任何事
I'll do anything for you. Anything.

436
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,930
求你了
Please? Just...

437
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:53,510
给我个机会
give me a chance.

438
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,410
谢谢
Thank you.

439
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,280
西德尼
Sidney.

440
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,060
查出什么了
What'd you find?

441
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,970
收养所那边查不出什么
The agency was a dead end,

442
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:17,730
但我在卫生处那边想了点法子
but I worked my magic with the health department.

443
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,700
生母的资料全查出来了
Found out all about his mother.

444
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,200
我这就把信息传真给你
I'm faxing over the information right now.

445
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,050
-应该马上就能收到了  -来了
- You should have it any second. - It's here.

446
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,800
不
No.

447
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:40,140
你知道的
You knew.

448
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,610
知道什么
Knew what exactly?

449
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:46,780
这个你帮我从凤凰城找来的孩子
The child that you located for me in Phoenix,

450
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:49,170
他的生母是十八年前
his mother was found in the woods,

451
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:53,010
在童话镇外的树林里被发现的
outside of Storybrooke, 18 years ago.

452
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:55,070
还真是巧呢
What a startling coincidence.

453
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,840
十八年前
18 years ago?!

454
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,220
我真的不知道你在说什么
I fear I'm missing the significance.

455
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,370
请原谅
You'll have to forgive me.

456
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,580
我的记忆力现在不行了
My memory's not what it used to be.

457
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:07,220
亨利的母亲幼年时
Henry's mother was found

458
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,530
在某个重要的日子
as a baby,

459
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:11,670
被人发现
on a very significant day--

460
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,050
就是在那一天
the day this town...

461
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,080
童话镇
this town...

462
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,690
童话镇怎么了
This town what?

463
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:21,400
她就是关键  是不是
She's important, isn't she?

464
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:23,320
这位母亲
This mother.

465
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:24,990
她是否重要
Is she important?

466
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:27,890
当然了  她生下了你的儿子
I suppose inasmuch as she gave birth to your son.

467
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:30,720
是你
You.

468
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,440
这一切
You built this

469
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:35,860
全是你预谋好的  是不是
into this whole thing, didn't you?

470
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:39,330
你让我收养他  因为他的母亲
You made this happen because the mother,

471
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,750
她是...
she's...

472
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,200
她怎么了  镇长女士
She's what, madame mayor,

473
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,260
你好像很怕这位母亲
this mother that you seem to fear so much?

474
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:51,990
你真对我所说的一无所知吗
Oh, you really know nothing of what I'm talking about?

475
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,450
我知道你很不安  这点倒是显而易见的
Well, I know you're upset. That much is clear.

476
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,820
你说过  我会再来找你的
You told me I'd come to you,

477
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:59,100
你说  我的心上有一个空洞
that I'd have a hole in my heart.

478
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:00,810
你还说...
And...

479
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,430
你想终结这一切
You want this to end.

480
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:09,130
我辛辛苦苦打造的镇子
This town, what I built.

481
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:12,050
你想要引来孩子的生母  从而摧毁我的心血
You wanna destroy it all by bringing the mother back.

482
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:13,880
所以你谋划了这一切
That's why you did all this!

483
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,630
知道吗  你眼下有黑眼圈了
Do you know you have dark circles under your eyes

484
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:19,640
声音还发颤
And a weary tremble in your voice?

485
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,730
可怜人啊
Poor thing.

486
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:23,220
身为人母把你折磨成什么样了
Look what motherhood has done to you.

487
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:28,680
你就继续装傻吧  小魔鬼
Play dumb all you want, you little imp.

488
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:32,310
你该知道自己在和谁作对
You should know who you're dealing with by now.

489
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:36,240
我牺牲了一切才换来现在的生活
I sacrificed everything to build this life!

490
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:39,780
没有任何事物能阻挡我复仇的脚步
And nothing will tear me away from my revenge!

491
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:44,290
亨利明天就将被送回波士顿
Henry goes back to Boston tomorrow!

492
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:55,980
看啊
Look.

493
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,310
小心点
Careful.

494
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:10,240
潘不会无缘无故把盒子丢在这儿的
Pan wouldn't have just left it behind for no reason.

495
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,830
这是能让戴维回家的唯一希望了
It's David's only way home.

496
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:14,430
没有戈登  我们将被困在此地
Without Gold, we're stuck here. 

497
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,250
玛丽·玛格丽特
Mary Margaret!

498
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:26,080
你们怎么还是这么蠢
Are you still at it?

499
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:27,870
你们就不明白吗
Don't you know?

500
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,530
彼得·潘永远不会失败
Peter Pan never fails.

501
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,060
没想到你们能找到我
I didn't expect you to find me.

502
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:35,990
不过话说回来  看到你们我一点都不吃惊
But then again, I shouldn't be surprised.

503
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,060
你们都是母亲
You're mothers.

504
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,350
非常在意自己的孩子
Quite tenacious about your offspring.

505
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:41,670
说来你们也许不信  但我明白那种感受
Believe it or not, I understand that.

506
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,610
但如果你们是为亨利而来的
But if you're looking to see Henry again,

507
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,390
我不得不告诉你们
I have to tell you,

508
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,470
你们母子相见的唯一办法
there's only one place you'll be reunited--

509
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:48,810
就是死亡
in death.

510
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:01,300
说明我都写好了
I wrote out instructions

511
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,790
关于他的睡觉  午睡和喂食
for his bedtime, nap time, and feeding.

512
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,190
米尔斯女士  我向你保证
Ms. Mills, I assure you,

513
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:08,930
宝宝会有专业人士照顾
the baby will be in expert hands here.

514
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:09,600
我知道
I know.

515
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:12,150
我只是很伤心我们处不来        
I'm just sad that this couldn't work out.

516
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,810
事情总是...
The circumstances were...

517
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,390
难以预料
unforeseen.

518
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:19,160
不是每个孩子和父母都适合的
Not every child is the right fit for a parent.

519
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,240
有时领养孩子
And sometimes, putting the child first

520
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,240
首先代表有勇气放弃他
can mean having the strength to give him up.

521
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,220
亨利再去哪
Where will Henry go next?

522
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,030
已经有个家庭等着了
We already have a new family lined up.

523
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,940
他会好好的
He's gonna be just fine.

524
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:35,750
这样  你再和他待会
I tell you what. You take a minute.

525
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,200
我一会回来  好吗
I'll be right back. Okay?

526
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,230
亨利
Oh, Henry.

527
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:57,000
你值得比我更好的父母
You deserve better than me.

528
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:01,460
你真是所有人里
You truly are the only one in all the realms

529
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,750
唯一信任我的人
who believes in me.

530
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,110
你可以让我抱他
Would you like me to hold him

531
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:20,150
然后我们最后签字确认
so we can get the last little signature?

532
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:22,900
不  没这个必要了
No. That won't be necessary.

533
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,290
亨利是我儿子
Henry is my son.

534
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:35,050
对亨利来说最好的
The best thing for Henry is to stay with a mother

535
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:36,890
是留在永不抛弃他的妈妈身边
who will never let go of him,

536
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,400
再也不会
ever again.

537
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,150
恐怕出了点意外
I'm afraid there's been a hiccup.

538
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:48,110
你们要重新等待了
You'll have to go back on the waiting list.

539
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,510
那位妈妈改主意了
The mother changed her mind.

540
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,200
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

541
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,680
我们失去他了吗
We... Lost him?

542
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:56,790
是的  但你们可以重新排队
Yes, but I can put you back on the list.

543
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,560
潘会不高兴的
Pan will not be pleased.

544
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,120
我们不会放弃的
Which is why we don't give up.

545
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:01,880
我们会得到那孩子
We will get that child.

546
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,460
动不了吗
Having trouble moving?

547
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,750
鉴于是这儿  意料之中
Not surprised, given where you are.

548
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:09,870
你们的悔意会加速你们的死亡
You see, what's hastening your demise is your regret.

549
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:11,170
你什么意思
What are you talking about?

550
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,510
在这发生了对我很重要的事
This tree is the site of a very important event for me.

551
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,030
我在这抛弃了我儿子
I abandoned my boy here.

552
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:18,910
你还有儿子
You have a son?

553
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:20,470
我比看上去大多了
I'm older than I look.

554
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:22,810
如果你有孩子  你肯定也后悔抛弃他
If you have a child, you must regret losing him, too.

555
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:23,800
但我不后悔
But I don't.

556
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:25,960
事实上  正好相反
Quite the opposite, actually.

557
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,720
你看  我把他装盒子里了
See, I have him all boxed up,

558
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,400
这样我就不会再失去他
so I don't lose him again.

559
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,720
朗普斯金是你儿子吗
Rumplestiltskin is your son?

560
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:34,130
是的
That he is.

561
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:35,290
这怎么可能
How is that possible?

562
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:36,840
你...
You're...

563
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,790
比他年轻吗  其实不是
Younger than him? Not really.

564
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,620
就像你和你女儿
Just like you and your daughter.

565
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,030
你在说谎
You're a fraud.

566
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,680
你的魔力很弱了
Your magic is weakened.

567
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,860
你甚至伤不了我们
You can't even hurt us,

568
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,950
更别提抓朗普斯金了
let alone Rumplestiltskin.

569
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:49,760
你说得对
You're right.

570
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,250
但这是我来这的原因
But that's why I'm here.

571
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:55,210
这棵树会保护我  直到我恢复魔力
This tree will protect me until my power is restored.

572
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:55,820
然后...
And then...

573
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,130
然后我就去找点乐子
Well, then I get to have some real fun.

574
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:03,460
我再也不用惦记我的孩子了
And I'll have to ever worry about my child again.

575
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,320
我们马上会达成一致的
Something else we will all soon have in common.

576
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:09,740
一定有别的办法
There has to be another way.

577
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,860
没有  你们再也找不到我
No, you're not going to get to me.

578
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,450
这棵树攻击每个来这的人
See, this tree attacks the regret inside

579
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:16,370
内心的悔意  而你呢
anyone who comes here. And you?

580
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:17,670
你心里有不少
You've got plenty.

581
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,490
我后悔之前有机会时
I regret not taking a better shot at you

582
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:20,410
没能把握好
when I had a chance.

583
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,140
这可不是全部  不是吗  救世主
Well, that's not all, is it, savior?

584
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:24,330
不是
No.

585
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,940
你儿子的心在我身体里
I have your son's heart inside me.

586
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:31,310
我能感到你一次又一次
I can feel just how much you let him down

587
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:33,090
让他有多失望
time and time again.

588
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:34,040
别再这么说她了
Leave her alone.

589
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:35,660
也许是吧
Perhaps I should.

590
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,650
毕竟她哪有机会当个好妈妈
After all, what chance did she have at being a good mother?

591
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,490
看看你给她竖的榜样
Look at the example you've set,

592
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:42,480
抛弃她28年
abandoning her for 28 years.

593
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,000
你说够了吗
Are you finished?

594
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:46,680
皇后的遗言
Last words from the queen.

595
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:48,120
可能是有最多后悔人的
Perhaps a deathbed confession

596
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,260
临终独白
from the one who has the most to regret of all.

597
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:52,580
确实  不过有个问题
Yeah, there's one problem with that.

598
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:57,390
我的确下了摧毁所有人的诅咒
I did cast a curse that devastated an entire population.

599
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,150
我虐待过别人  也杀过人
I have tortured and murdered.

600
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,690
我做过很多坏事
I've done some terrible things.

601
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:05,340
我应该被后悔掩埋  但是...
I should be overflowing with regret, but...

602
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,150
我没有
I'm not.

603
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:14,640
因为这让我想起我儿子
Because it got me my son.

604
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:26,540
现在...
Now...

605
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:29,710
我们去救亨利
let's go save Henry.

606
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,180
亨利  他在哪
Henry?! Where is he?

607
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:48,290
他在这
He's over here!

608
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,180
坚持住  亨利
hold on, Henry.

609
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,600
亨利
Henry?

610
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:12,280
我们来晚了吗
Are we too late?

611
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:13,600
亨利
Henry?

612
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:15,750
亲爱的
Honey!

613
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,050
别着急  小家伙
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Take it easy, buddy.

614
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:26,430
对不起  我
I'm sorry. I...

615
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,060
我只是想要拯救魔法
I wanted to save magic.

616
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,980
没事  没事了
It's okay. It's okay.

617
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:32,260
我想做个英雄
I-I wanted to be a hero.

618
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,770
还有很多足够多的时间让你做个英雄呢
There's plenty of time for that. 

619
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:35,170
现在该好好休息
And now it's time to rest.

620
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,800
欢迎回来  年轻人
welcome back, young sir.

621
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,470
把最好的都给我们的贵宾
Only the best for our guest of honor,

622
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,950
你们说呢  去船长室
don't you think? Captain's quarters.

623
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:43,800
来吧  我来带你去安顿下来
Come on. I'll tuck you in.

624
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,640
瑞金娜  我真的很高兴
Regina, I'm just so pleased.

625
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:50,820
我得承认  我之前很担心
I'll admit, I was concerned.

626
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:55,070
我很高兴一切都能顺利解决
And I'm just so glad the way things worked out.

627
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:57,560
还有一个问题  和普医生
There's just one problem, Dr. Hopper.

628
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,220
我担心
I'm afraid...

629
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,270
不  我
No, I'm...

630
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:02,930
害怕
dreading...

631
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:08,310
亨利的生母有一天会突然醒悟
that Henry's birth mother will wake up one day

632
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:10,080
后悔遗弃他
full of regret over leaving him,

633
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,960
然后来到这里带走他
and come here to take him back.

634
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:17,760
不是保密收养吗
Wasn't it a closed adoption?

635
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:19,310
你们两人的信息对彼此
I mean, you're both perfectly anonymous

636
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,420
都是完全保密的  不是吗
to each other, right?

637
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:24,530
是的  但是我担心的是比法律
Yes, but I'm worried about something bigger

638
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:26,600
更强大的东西
than the law is at play.

639
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:29,410
命运
Fate.

640
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,180
天命
Destiny.

641
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,780
在我看来  你已经决定了自己的命运
It seems to me like you've made your own destiny.

642
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,310
但是还是有人
But there's still someone out there

643
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,550
能够摧毁这一切
who can destroy it.

644
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,880
瑞金娜  如果你一直担心未来
Regina, if you keep worrying about the future,

645
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:40,800
你就无法享受现在
you'll never enjoy the present.

646
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,560
这个孩子给你带来了
This child has brought something to you--

647
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,810
爱
Love.

648
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:47,840
好好享受它  好好享受作为一个母亲
Revel in that. Revel in being a mother.

649
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:01,720
谢谢你  父亲
Thank you, father.

650
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:13,390
很久以前  有一个皇后
Once upon a time, there was a queen,

651
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:17,640
她施了一个美好的咒语
and she cast a glorious curse,

652
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,370
那个咒语给了她一切她想要的
that gave her everything she wanted...

653
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,230
至少她是这么认为的
Or so she thought.

654
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:28,920
当她了解到  复仇还不够时
She despaired when she learned that...

655
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,650
她绝望了
revenge was not enough.

656
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,780
她很寂寞
She was lonely.

657
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:40,260
所以她四处搜寻  找到了一个小男孩
And so she searched the land for a little boy

658
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:42,280
来做她的王子
to be her prince.

659
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,880
然后
And then...

660
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,370
她找到了他
She found him.

661
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,440
尽管他们快乐地生活在一起
And though they lived happily,

662
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:53,090
但这并能不永久
it was not ever after.

663
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:58,980
外面还潜伏着邪恶
There was still an evil out there lurking.

664
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:04,360
皇后担心她得小王子的安全
The queen was worried for her prince's safety.

665
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:09,080
她知道她可以战胜
While she knew she could vanquish

666
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,800
对他的一切威胁
any threat to the boy,

667
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:15,850
她也知道她不能忧心忡忡地抚养他
she also knew she couldn't raise him worrying.

668
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:20,220
不
No.

669
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:26,140
她需要把她自己的麻烦搁置在一边
She needed to put her own troubles aside,

670
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:28,750
把孩子放在优先的地位
and put her child first.

671
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:35,170
因此
And so...

672
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,950
皇后制成了
The queen procured

673
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,660
一种古老的遗忘药剂
an ancient potion of forgetting.

674
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,160
没事的
Oh, it's all right.

675
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:44,800
如果皇后喝下了药剂
If the queen drinks the potion,

676
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,750
她也不会忘记她的孩子
she won't forget her child.

677
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,520
她只会忘了自己的担忧
She'll only forget her worries...

678
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,120
她的麻烦
her troubles...

679
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:55,850
她的恐惧
her fears.

680
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:02,730
一旦这些都被遗忘
And with those gone...

681
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:09,050
她  和她的王子就能够
she... and her prince can indeed

682
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:11,230
从此
finally live

683
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:14,830
幸福地生活在一起
happily ever after.

684
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,310
你好  亨利
Hello, Henry.

685
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,680
我们今天要做什么呢
What shall we do today?

686
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:50,630
我了解那表情
Oh, I know that look.

687
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:54,240
那是打了五小时电游之后吃了太多匹萨的表情
That's five hours of Space Paranoids and too much pizza.

688
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,480
匹萨很好吃
Pizza's good.

689
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:11,030
有点刺痛
It stings.

690
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,900
这是干什么
What's that for?

691
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,270
一个咒语
A spell,

692
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:18,210
这样就再也没人能够
so no one can ever take your heart

693
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,370
拿走你的心脏了
ever again.

694
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:23,360
谢谢  妈妈
Thanks, mom.

695
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:38,510
我们很快就会到家了  我的小王子
We'll be home soon, my little prince.

696
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,660
抱歉不得不这样  亨利
I'm sorry it had to come to this, Henry.

697
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,160
小比
Bae.

698
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,350
爸爸
Papa.

699
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:39,080
-亨利在哪  -他很安全  很安全
- Where's Henry? - He's safe. He's safe.

700
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:42,090
我就说我不会伤害他的
I told you I wasn't gonna hurt the boy.

701
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:43,820
我知道  对不起  我
I know. I'm sorry. I...

702
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:47,370
你为什么没告诉我潘是你的父亲
Why didn't you tell me Pan was your father?

703
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:49,340
因为我不想让你知道
Because I didn't want you to know

704
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:51,810
我和他一样是个糟糕的父亲
that I was as bad a father as he was.

705
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:54,160
因为我和他  我们都一样
Because we're both the same, me and him,

706
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,450
因为我们都抛弃了自己的儿子
because we both abandoned our sons.

707
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:59,600
不  你不一样
No, you're not the same.

708
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:02,950
你为了我回来了  爸爸
You came back for me, papa.

709
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,440
他回来了
He's back.

710
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,050
-那就意味着  -他可以治愈我
- That means... - He can cure me.

711
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:15,670
我们就能回家了
We can go home...

712
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,210
一家人一起
A family.

713
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:30,310
怎么了
What's wrong?

714
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:32,260
干嘛  你在干什么
What? What are you doing?

715
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,430
我想要你的心脏  亨利
I wanted your heart, Henry,

716
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,580
但是你妈妈从我这里夺走了它
but your mother took it away from me

717
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:38,420
放任我死去
and left me for dead.

718
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,190
这是她的错
Her mistake.

719
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,150
真聪明
Oh, how clever.

720
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,800
你在干什么
Ow! What are you doing?

721
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:57,920
血魔法两边都有效
Blood magic works both ways...

722
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:59,150
父亲
Father.

723
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:15,090
不
No!

724
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:22,020
亨利  亨利
Henry? Henry!

725
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:24,080
不
Oh, no.

726
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,230
亨利
Henry!

727
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,620
没事
it's okay.

728
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,110
我没事
I'm okay.

729
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,730
你确定吗
Are you sure?

730
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:32,610
他是个坚强的孩子  瑞金娜
He's a strong boy, Regina.

731
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:35,020
你把他抚养得很好
You raised him well.

732
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:49,450
走  来这边
Go. Over here.

733
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:54,380
准备好了吗  瑞金娜
Ready, Regina?

734
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,390
你觉得这能飞
You think it'll fly?

735
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,550
没有其他选择了
It has no choice.

736
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,410
让我们离开该死的梦幻岛吧
Then let's get the hell out of Neverland.

737
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:34,040
如您所愿  女士
As you wish, m'lady.

738
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:36,040
水手长  起锚
Bosun, weigh anchor!

739
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,850
在我们第一次降落在这个岛上时
You know, when we first landed on this island,

740
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:54,030
你说我们需要一起努力
you said we'd all need to work together.

741
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:55,360
我只是尝试一切可能
I was just trying anything.

742
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:58,700
老实说  我之前觉得不可能
Well, to be honest, I didn't think it was possible.

743
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:02,120
我不相信英雄  坏人  海盗
That a hero, a villain, a pirate...

744
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,690
可以都团结起来 但是我们做到了
that we could all be united, but we were

745
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:09,810
就因为这拼图中最重要的一块
because of the most important piece of the puzzle--

746
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,410
一个领导者
a leader.

747
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,890
我很高兴我们能够一起努力
I'm just glad that we were all able to work together

748
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:17,280
把亨利带回家
and get Henry home.

749
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,030
把所有人都带回家
Get all of us home.

750
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:32,110
比待在笼子里强多了  是吧
Better than being in a cage, isn't it?

751
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,530
我们真的自由了吗
Are we really free?

752
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,190
是的  温迪
Yes, Wendy.

753
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:39,520
很快你就能见到你的弟弟们了
Soon, you'll see your brothers.

754
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:43,630
我有东西给你
I have something for you.

755
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:46,030
我一直都保存着
I've saved it all this time.

756
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:48,250
我可能永远也用不到  但是
I could never use it, but...

757
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:50,260
也许你可以
maybe you can.

758
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:52,910
这是精灵尘
It's pixie dust.

759
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:56,330
这是树顶最后一朵花的最后一点精灵尘了
It's the last bit from the last flower in the treetops.

760
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:58,670
-它是惰性的  -我不能让它起作用
- It's inert-- - I can't make it work.

761
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,690
我没有魔法了
I've got no magic.

762
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:03,880
从我失去翅膀时就没有了
Not since I lost my wings.

763
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,440
你会想到办法的
You'll figure it out.

764
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:10,130
我相信你  小叮当
I believe in you, Tink.

765
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:23,960
你还好吗  你不是该好好休息吗
You feelin' okay? Shouldn't you be resting?

766
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:26,770
你要是想吃东西我可以给你拿一些来
I could bring you some food if you're feelin' up for it.

767
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:28,510
我现在感觉好多了
I'm feeling much better now.

768
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:31,720
-我觉得新鲜空气对我更好  -好吧
- I think the fresh air is good for me. - Okay.

769
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,060
亨利
Henry...

770
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,780
我知道我们还没什么机会
I know we haven't had much of a chance

771
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:40,180
成为一家人  暂时没有
to be a family. Not yet.

772
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,740
只是  我想让你知道你现在有爸爸了
Just, I want you to know that you have a dad now.

773
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:45,740
从今往后一直都有
Now and for forever.

774
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,070
我永远都不会离开你的  小家伙
I'll never leave you, okay, buddy?

775
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:00,720
很高兴你救回了你的儿子  瑞金娜
I'm glad you got your son back, Regina.

776
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:02,310
看来巫后终究
Seems the evil queen

777
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:04,720
是能爱上一个人的
was able to love someone after all.

778
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:07,250
是的  看来是这样的
Yes, it seems.

779
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,320
看来你是对的
It seems you were right.

780
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,590
我知道你内心还有善
I knew you still had some good in you.

781
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:16,800
匀? 你还有魔法
Apparently, you still have some magic in you.

782
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:18,250
发生
What--

783
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:19,570
发生了什么
What happened?

784
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:22,270
要我说  我只会说有那么一瞬间
Well, if I had to guess, I'd say for a moment there,

785
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,700
你坚信不疑
you believed.

786
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,360
走开  小孩
Go away, boy.

787
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:38,310
不饿
Not hungry.

788
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:42,340
我是来谢你的
But I came to thank you.

789
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:48,960
不管其他叛徒做了什么
No matter what those other traitors do,

790
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:51,110
我都支持潘
I'm on Pan's side.

791
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:53,930
-而潘  -永不失败
- And Pan-- - Never fails.

792
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:55,710
什么
What?

793
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:56,970
你听到了
You heard me.

794
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:59,330
彼得·潘永不失败
Peter Pan never fails.

795
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,570
不能被阻止
He can't be stopped.

796
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:04,650
即使他们都认为他被打败了
Even when they think he's defeated,

797
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,600
他们都认为他们赢了
when they think they've won,

798
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:07,900
他找到了办法
he finds a way.

799
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,620
你觉得你不安全
So you think you're not safe?

800
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:12,620
不  我非常安全
Oh, no, I'm perfectly safe.

801
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:15,450
在我们的斗争中  我的命运被封闭了
During our struggle, my fate was sealed.

802
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,500
有麻烦的那个
The one who's in trouble...

803
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:19,690
是亨利
is Henry.

804
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,470
但你是亨利
But you're Henry.

805
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,720
不再是了
Not anymore.

806
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,010
你们
You...

807

你们互换了
You switched.

808
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:34,050
你确定你不饿吗
You sure you're not hungry?

809
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,320
谢谢你
Thank you...

810
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:42,220
潘
Pan.
