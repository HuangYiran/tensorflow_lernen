413
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:40,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who let a cookie on the carpet?

414
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:46,530

00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:08,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you guys just hanged out, had a good time together?

418
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:13,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Actually.You know,I never thought to admit this,but we had a pretty great time together.

419
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:17,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Really? -Yeah.

420
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:22,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Surprised me, too. -So you just worked it out by yourselves?

421
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:27,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah,I guess. I don't know,Mum. Do make big deal about it. please.

423
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:35,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:02,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What was General Grant doing on the thermostat?

430
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:06,120

431
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:09,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No idea, huh?

432
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:15,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These,these off limit.No touch.

433
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:19,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They are not toys. They are figurines！

434
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:26,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We get to keep them away from the bathroom.

435
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:29,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-For the next ten years? -Listen to me.

437
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:37,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}deny, deny,deny,even if they figure it out.

438
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:43,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Never,Ever, admit anything. Deny, deny,deny.Got it?

439
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:47,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Got it. Deny,deny,deny.

440
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:51,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sounds to me,like Lie,lie,lie.

441
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wish you haven't told me

442
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:59,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you understand? Rodrick isn't beating me up anymore.

443
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How could they not notice that the lock is gone?

444
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:07,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please,they are like forty. They can barely remember our names.

445
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:15,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi,Greg, I've returned from  halfway around the world.

446
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:19,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I can see that you even didn't get closer to Holly Hills.

447
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:24,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think your elder brother was right about you.You have no game.

448
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:30,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what,I'd like Chirag a lot better when he was in India.

449
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:34,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Man,I shall miss Chirag. When would he come back?

450
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:39,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-It's almost I can feel his presence. -What are you talking about?

451
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:41,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here I am.

452
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:44,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you just hear something?

453
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:48,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, nothing. Wll,better go to class.

454
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chirag would've wanted that way.

455
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:57,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You may be able to dominateme physically, Greg Heffley,but mentally I am the more muscular.

456
00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:00,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is official on.

457
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:11,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Hi, Rowley. -Hey.

458
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:17,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Does he know about the D-O-R-E?

459
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:20,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The door.

460
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:24,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, don't worry. I already told him, deny,deny,deny.

461
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:27,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi,Rowley, what you do?

462
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:43,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Was there a lock on this door?

463
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I must lose my marbles.

464
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:53,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't take this pressure.I'm leaving.

465
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ok,everyone.Dinner time.

466
00:43:56,490 --> 00:43:59,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Actually,Mom, I have to skip dinner.

467
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:02,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Why? -I have got the most important meeting in my life tonight.

468
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:07,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you say you have a meeting? Like, for like a job?

469
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:10,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kind of. I'm meeting with the best guitar player of Plainview.And he is in between bands.

470
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:15,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And if I get him in L?did Diper, then winning the talent show is a lock.

471
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, you will like him, Dad. He is a real professional like you.

472
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:21,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Be supportive.

473
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's him. I'll get that.

474
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:30,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,man.I barely made it here. Your address has so many numbers.

475
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ok, Bill, I think we should..

476
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:37,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well.Do I smell pork roast?

477
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:52,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bill Walter is most likely to be a rock star when he was in high school.

478
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:54,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You suck.

479
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:58,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But that hasn't really work out.

480
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:00,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-We really should go. -Sit.

481
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:12,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, Bill,Rodrick tells me that you are a professional musician, so that means you earn enough to make a living?

482
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:14,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,Yeah.

483
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:18,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well enough if you live in your parents' basement.

484
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:21,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My parents are really supportive.

485
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:26,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Respect your parents, boys. -Hey, that's what Joshie says.

486
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:31,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Doesn't sound like a cakewalk -No.

487
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:35,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you tell Rodrick,give him a picture of how challenging it can really be.

488
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:41,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, it's really hard. First of all, there is no home cooked meals like this.

489
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:44,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? Really?

490
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:51,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.No, on the road,it's all burgers, fries and pizzas.

491
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:55,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then you gona deal with the fans. Especially the girls.

492
00:45:55,820 --> 00:46:00,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, it's, it's definitely not for everyone.

493
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:08,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But if you like rocking deep into the night and party in the heart all day...

494
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:12,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-then that might be the life for you. -It's definitely for me.

495
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:17,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It does sound fun. But what if you don't play musical instrument?

496
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:22,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-L?ded Diper always need lodeds. -So, you joining the band?

498
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:41,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think I might brought too much stuffs.

499
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:45,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's just see how many views our video has got. Must gonna be thousands.

500
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:47,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe millions.

501
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:51,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Four? We only got four browsers?

502
00:46:52,450 --> 00:46:55,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg, I can't lie to your parents about the party.

503
00:46:55,130 --> 00:46:58,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I never lie. Joshie says lie hurts everyone.

504
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:04,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Guess who wants to join the big boys sleepover? -Manny.Manny.

505
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:07,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Mom, no, he will ruin it. -He just wanted to come and say hello to  Rowley.

506
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:14,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And Rowley's mother brought over some healthy snacks and a DVD that she thought was appropriate.

507
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:17,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Enjoy your candy bars. Boys.

508
00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:27,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Andy's Magic Cushion. Let's start with that.

509
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:32,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or should we watch The Foot?

510
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What if she comes back in and asks about the party?

511
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You needs relax.

512
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:43,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How about some healthy snacks?

513
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:02,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We shouldn't be here, just can't let ourselves into stranger's home.

514
00:48:02,030 --> 00:48:05,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The place is empty. Nobody's gonna mind

515
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:09,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hooh.

516
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at his face.

517
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:15,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happened to his foot?

518
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:24,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It sounded like someone was hoping.

519
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:28,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm telling you it's nothing. It's just your imagination.

520
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:32,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you just kick me?

521
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:51,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, you really need to cut your toenails.

522
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did you say?

523
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:05,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Turn it off.Turn it off.

524
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:09,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK, because you're scared.

525
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:13,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just go to sleep.

526
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wish we watched Andy's Magic Cushion.

527
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:30,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love this movie, Frank. Don't you just love this movie?

528
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:35,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He picks the housekeeper over the supermodel?

529
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:38,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know.

530
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:43,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah!It is coming! The foot is coming!Ah!

531
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:04,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg, is there something you want to say to Rowley and his father?

532
00:50:06,330 --> 00:50:10,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry for choosing an inappropriate movie for the sleepover.

533
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:13,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At least nobody got hurt this time.

534
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:16,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am a little bird.I'm a little bird.

535
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My knee broke.

536
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:27,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

537
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:35,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}SUITABLE VIEWING FOR KIDS? BIG MOTHER IS WATCHING.

538
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:37,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mommy.Look.

539
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:40,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mommy is looking. Mommy is looking a thousand times.

540
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:44,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mommy just needs to go to the potty for one minute.

541
00:50:45,030 --> 00:50:47,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh. No.No.No.

542
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:51,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the heck?

543
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:53,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where is the lock?

544
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:56,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Weird.

545
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:11,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rodrick, could you come here,please?

546
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happened to the lock?

547
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I don't know what you are talking about? -There was a lock on this door.

548
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:22,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think so.

549
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:26,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rodrick,I have lived in this house for ten years and I've locked that door ten thousands times,

550
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:29,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because sometimes it's my only moment for privacy of the day.

551
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:34,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-And there was a lock on the door. -There wasn't. Trust me. Greg has walked in on me like a million times...

552
00:51:34,870 --> 00:51:37,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and if there was a lock, I would use it.

553
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:41,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In fact, maybe you should put one on.

554
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:47,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}SO that's your story? There was never a lock and you have no idea what I'm talking about?

555
00:51:47,830 --> 00:51:49,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

556
00:51:50,910 --> 00:51:54,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fine.I will just go to your brother and ask the same thing.

557
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:11,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg,two words: Bathroom! Door!

558
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:22,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was Rodrick. He held a party.Someone ruined the door, so we had to change it.

559
00:52:22,330 --> 00:52:26,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I knew it.I knew it. -No, Mom,I was exaggerating a little bit.

560
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:29,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It wasn't a party.It was only a band rehearsal for the talent show.That all it was.

561
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:33,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We said no one could come over. He knew the rules.

562
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:36,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But Mom,if you punish him, Rodrick can know I told on him.

563
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:39,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We really had a good time this weekend but if you do this ...

564
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:43,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rodrick and I will never, ever be  friends again.

565
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:47,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The idea that one day my kids won't get to know Uncle Rodrick?

566
00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:50,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or any family holidays.

567
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:53,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You two really having get bettter along this weekend, haven't you?

568
00:52:53,350 --> 00:52:56,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah,we really have.

569
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:07,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ok,if,if I let this slide

570
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:12,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and be our little secret.

571
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:15,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for the sake of family and for your relationship with your brother. Do you swear...

572
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to be on your best behavior and to get better along?

573
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:21,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I swear. I swear. -OK.OK.

575
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:59,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know...

576
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:03,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you may not be half dumb as I thought you were.

577
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:10,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I couldn't believe it. Rodrick was actually trying to be nice to me.

578
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:20,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're a Mum Box millionaire. Where did you get this?

579
00:54:20,770 --> 00:54:24,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thrift Shops. There is enough in here to last me until I'm 30

580
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:33,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is time, little bro, that you understand the secrets to musing life.

581
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:37,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rule No. One: Don't be good at something you don't want to do.

582
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:48,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guys, use clean rags, not ...

583
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:52,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give me that, I'll do that myself.

584
00:54:53,650 --> 00:54:57,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rule No. Two: Always Lower Mom and Dad's expectation.

585
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:07,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I took a math test today, you know, pretty sure, I've flunked it. -Oh,Greg!

586
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:12,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I got it back.And look, I got a C-.

587
00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:17,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,at least you didn't fail.

588
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:23,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rule No. Three: Never do something when sombody else can do before you.

589
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:28,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO -I remember that assignment.

590
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:34,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why write a new one when there is a perfect paper alreay written by your brother?

591
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:38,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Isn't that cheating?

592
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:43,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Isn't Mr. Draybrick cheating by hanging up the same assignment every year?

593
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:50,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}New binder. Teachers dig binders

594
00:55:52,270 --> 00:55:58,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The thing was, Rodrick had managed to get my Dad to do all of his homework for the last five years.

595
00:55:58,810 --> 00:56:03,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Which one is the space part again? -Oh,just let me do it.Ok?Ok?

596
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:07,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I would never actually hand in a paper Rodrick wrote.

597
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:10,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But my Dad? That is a different story.

598
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:12,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So that's just the three things Rodrick has taught me.

599
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:17,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-He has a lot of cool tips. -I'm not sure Rodrick tips are really that cool.

600
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:23,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So the invisible Chirag joke is still going.

601
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:27,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The whole school is on it, but it looks like Chirag discovered our weakness.

602
00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:31,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi,Greg,Rowley. Still pretending I'm invisible,I presume?

603
00:56:31,870 --> 00:56:34,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wonder if I can do this.

604
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:39,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Remain strong. -What is this? A Corn Dog.

605
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:42,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rowley's all-time favorite lunch dish.

606
00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:46,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you say you can see me,Rowley, it is all yours.

607
00:56:48,310 --> 00:56:54,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Smell the fragrance. -Do not, Rowley.

608
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:59,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey,everyone.Look, there is a floating Corn Dog.

609
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:13,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't want to get ahead of myself for anything, but I think I may have class crown in the back for dreaming this one up.

610
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:18,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In conclusion, without last century's technological advances ...

611
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:23,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}there be no computers, cell phones or modern medical miracles.

612
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:27,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And so for that we salute and thank our ancestors ...

613
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}from one hundred years ago.

614
00:57:36,710 --> 00:57:39,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you, Holly, that was excellent work.

615
00:57:39,870 --> 00:57:44,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, I think we have time for one more and I have to say ...

616
00:57:44,030 --> 00:57:48,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When I read this paper,I was big surprised by its content.

617
00:57:48,950 --> 00:57:54,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-But more than any other,this one deserves to be read aloud.Greg. -Yeah,Greg.

618
00:58:12,470 --> 00:58:16,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just read it,Greg.All of it.

619
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:25,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sometimes I sit and wonder about stuffs I do not know.

620
00:58:25,410 --> 00:58:29,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like what the earth was like a hundred years ago.

621
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:32,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did cavemen ride on dinosaurs?

622
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:37,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did flowers even grow? Did spiders rule the earth?

623
00:58:37,290 --> 00:58:40,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Were deserts falling sonw?

624
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:47,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There was no books for human,　so how are we to know what life was like a hundred years ago?

625
00:58:54,550 --> 00:58:58,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg,when we talk about how important it is to recycle...

626
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:01,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we don't mean turn in your brother's old papers.

627
00:59:04,310 --> 00:59:05,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}F. AGAIN.

628
00:59:08,070 --> 00:59:10,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought Daddy helped you with this paper?

629
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:14,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,actually,Dad started writng my paper because of that paper.

630
00:59:14,870 --> 00:59:16,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I looked like an idiot.

631
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:20,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that girl from the Oregon, she laughted at me.

632
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:24,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ouch. Just do something to change her opion of you.

633
00:59:24,890 --> 00:59:27,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like set a firecracker off the classroom.Boom!

634
00:59:27,910 --> 00:59:30,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chicks did like bad boys.

635
00:59:30,210 --> 00:59:35,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Actually I  was thinking about writing her a note. -You mean like one of the words on it?

636
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have already figured it out.

637
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:40,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I will pass her a note with a question on it.But it will be anonymous.

638
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:46,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She should have to know who wrote this and later I will walk up and ask her exact same question.

639
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:49,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It will blow her mind.

640
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:51,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know.You want me spell check it?

641
00:59:51,830 --> 00:59:54,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, just pass it to Holly.

642
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:56,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To Holly.

643
01:00:05,130 --> 01:00:08,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}HOW DO YOU GET YOUR HAIR TO SMELL SO BEAUTIFUL?

644
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:11,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

645
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:17,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's from Greg.

646
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:28,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What's going on? -Greg Heffley ...

647
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:31,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-is passing me notes. -No, I wasn't.

648
01:00:33,310 --> 01:00:36,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do you get your hair to  smell so beautiful?

649
01:00:55,810 --> 01:01:00,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ok, the note was might be said as a setback.But at least things are still going well with Rodrick.

650
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:05,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's amazing, but I'm actually enjoying watching Loded Diper's rehearsal for the talent show.

651
01:01:05,550 --> 01:01:08,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bill takes the band to a whole new level.

652
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:10,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Somebody farted.

653
01:01:17,370 --> 01:01:20,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Somebody farted.

654
01:01:23,310 --> 01:01:27,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My dad should be happy that I'm hanging out with Rodrick.

655
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:29,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I don't think he really likes Bill.

656
01:01:29,830 --> 01:01:32,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think what he is worried about is that I will turn out like Rodrick

657
01:01:32,850 --> 01:01:38,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Manny will turn out like me and eventually, we all turn out like Bill.

658
01:01:39,310 --> 01:01:42,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Loser VILLE

659
01:02:04,390 --> 01:02:07,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dear Greg, meet me in the art room before lunch.

660
01:02:07,530 --> 01:02:11,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There is something I want to ask you. Kiss,kiss, Holly.

661
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:30,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi, Holly, I was glad to get your note.

662
01:02:30,370 --> 01:02:35,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wanted the chance to talk to you. Hey, you like to paint?

663
01:02:35,530 --> 01:02:38,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am kind of an artist myself. Holly?

664
01:02:46,890 --> 01:02:50,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Chirag? -You see me now, don't you?

665
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:54,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Game, set and match.

666
01:03:09,310 --> 01:03:12,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Hi, Holly. -Hey, Fregley.

667
01:03:12,910 --> 01:03:15,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She thinks I am Fregley?

668
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:16,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's gonna hurt.

669
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:24,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you want to see my secret freckle?

670
01:03:29,370 --> 01:03:32,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So the note to the girl didn't work out?

671
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:39,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, let's go,little bro. I am taking you out.

672
01:03:41,470 --> 01:03:43,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And here are my other men.

673
01:03:43,610 --> 01:03:47,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg, Rodrick, like to meet my editors: Mrs Salz and Mr Cowen.

674
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:49,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Hello. -Nice to meet you.

675
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:51,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing?

676
01:03:51,070 --> 01:03:54,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just taking the little brother out this evening so that we can have a good time.

677
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:58,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,be safe, and be home by nine o'clock.

678
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Yeah, see ya. -Bye.

679
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:05,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Bye.Have fun. -Good night.

680
01:04:06,630 --> 01:04:12,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is impressive. My older boy, he wants nothing to do with his younger brothers.

681
01:04:12,070 --> 01:04:16,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You certainly practice what you preach.I think every mother in town should read your columns.

682
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:32,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom would kill us if she saw us doing this.

683
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:44,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Brain freeze.

684
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:52,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How I can say is to get your mind blown, we 're going to have an epic night.

685
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:57,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you okay?

686
01:05:00,380 --> 01:05:03,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fake vomit. You can't be the classics.

687
01:05:06,610 --> 01:05:09,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here he goes.

688
01:05:16,210 --> 01:05:19,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Very funny.

689
01:05:19,070 --> 01:05:21,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Very funny.

690
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:25,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is sweet.

693
01:05:56,230 --> 01:06:01,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,man.I mean don't take it hard.Girls act like they are not into when they are really are.

694
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:06,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean the girls act like they are not into me,but they are.

695
01:06:06,710 --> 01:06:09,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know they are. I bet she really likes you.

703

01:07:07,930 --> 01:07:10,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't get rid of me.

707
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:12,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm a superstar!

708
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:17,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Every where you go, it's me.

709
01:07:19,590 --> 01:07:22,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stupid carbs

710
01:07:22,270 --> 01:07:24,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's the mall. Come on.

711
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:26,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't go much further.

712
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:44,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Got you.

713
01:07:46,710 --> 01:07:48,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Coach Malone?

714
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:05,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Can't get out of me. I'm a superstar. "

715
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:08,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Every where you go, it's me. "

716
01:08:12,430 --> 01:08:15,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You boys are five minutes early. Did you have a good time?

717
01:08:15,310 --> 01:08:18,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-A great time. -That's so sweet.

718
01:08:18,150 --> 01:08:20,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just can't get over how well your boys get along.

719
01:08:20,670 --> 01:08:24,960


720
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:30,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}About boundaries, rules, anyway.Let me show you some of those civil war act photos last time you talked about.

721
01:08:30,610 --> 01:08:35,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-So what did you boys do? -Just hanging out at the mall.

722
01:08:35,510 --> 01:08:38,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And talked about life.

723
01:08:38,090 --> 01:08:40,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just nothing special.

724
01:08:40,270 --> 01:08:42,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,My God.

725
01:08:46,270 --> 01:08:49,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rodrick,can you explain what you are doing in this photo?

726
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:53,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not me.

727
01:08:54,770 --> 01:08:57,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-That's not you? -Nope.

728
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:00,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ok.How about these?

729
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:20,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't believe that you had a party!

730
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:23,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg, you told me it was a couple of kids.A band rehearsal.

731
01:09:23,270 --> 01:09:26,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait, Susan,you knew about this?

732
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:29,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Yes.Yes.I knew. -What!You told Mom?

733
01:09:29,710 --> 01:09:33,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You knew they had a party. -It's slipped out, but I took it back

734
01:09:33,530 --> 01:09:38,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You knew about this,but you did not tell me about it?

735
01:09:38,790 --> 01:09:42,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I still protected you.I threw Mom off your scent

736
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:47,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Great job, she has no idea. -We are supposed to be a team against them.

737
01:09:47,660 --> 01:09:50,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They are getting along so well and that blind me to the trust.

738
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:55,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Why were you taking pictures? -It's so busy that morning that I forgot we took the pictures.

739
01:09:55,610 --> 01:09:59,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry I let it slide and i'm so sorry.

740
01:09:59,390 --> 01:10:04,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I fell so good to talk it out. I even haven't lock that bathroom door for two weeks..

741
01:10:05,370 --> 01:10:11,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I knew that door had a lock on it. Everybody was trying to make me like I was losing my mind.

742
01:10:11,460 --> 01:10:15,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We will just let ourselves out. I wouldn't write a column about this

743
01:10:20,070 --> 01:10:22,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going upstairs ...

744
01:10:22,730 --> 01:10:29,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to a bathroom that has a lock on it  and no one can tell me that it doesn't.

745
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:33,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have to go, talk to your father.

746
01:10:35,490 --> 01:10:38,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I will deal with you boys later.

747
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:46,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rodrick,I really didn't tell her. I mean maybe sort of.

748
01:10:46,470 --> 01:10:50,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I made a deal with her and we really had a good time.

749
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:52,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're my brother ...

750
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:55,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}should never be my friend.

751
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:20,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your father and I have talked and we have  decided on your punishment.

752
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:26,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg, you are grounded for two weeks, also  no video games for two weeks.

753
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:31,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rodrick, you may only drive to and from school for the next month.

754
01:11:31,570 --> 01:11:36,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As the ringleader, you are also grounded for a month.

755
01:11:36,150 --> 01:11:38,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom, I'm sorry.

756
01:11:38,930 --> 01:11:41,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-And I won't do it again. -I know you won't.

757
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:46,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And to make sure ...

758
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are also not allowing you to perform on the talent show.

759
01:11:50,260 --> 01:11:51,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

760
01:11:51,860 --> 01:11:56,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. You can not do that.

761
01:11:56,330 --> 01:11:59,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have to let me play in that show. This could be my big break.

762
01:11:59,870 --> 01:12:01,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.

763
01:12:01,540 --> 01:12:04,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad, come on.This is not fair. I just got Bill in the band.

764
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:09,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Actually,Rodrick, that doesn't help you in this case.Bill is kind of jerk.

765
01:12:10,420 --> 01:12:13,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our decision is finial.

766
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're so dead.

767
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:29,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Things had never been worse.

768
01:12:29,490 --> 01:12:35,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our parents are super madded at us, so we have to spend the weekend at our grandfather boring retirement community.

769
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:38,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Holly thinks I'm Fregley.

770
01:12:38,510 --> 01:12:41,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And my relationship with Rodrick is all-time worse.

771
01:12:41,310 --> 01:12:44,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So he is making his mission is to ruin my life.

772
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:48,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Quit it. -Why do not you tell mom?

773
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:50,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are good at that.

774
01:12:50,180 --> 01:12:52,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grandpa doesn't like TV.

775
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:56,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Instead, he prefers to watch the lobby on the security camera.

776
01:12:56,170 --> 01:12:58,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I should be rehearsing right now.

777
01:12:59,740 --> 01:13:03,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please, gradepa,please,can we  watch a real TV show now?

778
01:13:03,580 --> 01:13:09,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}TV is just bunch of fakeness. This is real life.

779
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:12,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Real life, can't be beated.

780
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:20,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How about we go down to the gameroom. You boys like games, don't you?

781
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:28,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The gameroom sounds like fun until you realize that all the games there are from,like 1800.

782
01:13:28,290 --> 01:13:33,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My grandpa's favorite game is a real old board game called "Joke tellers.

783
01:13:33,090 --> 01:13:37,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, remember: The objective of the game is to read the joke out...

784
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:40,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and all the other players have to try not to laugh.

785
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:44,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good luck. There are some real tickles there.

786
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:47,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You go first.

787
01:13:49,390 --> 01:13:53,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Putting economic policy before fiscal responsiblity is like ...

788
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:57,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}putting the card before the horse.

789
01:14:02,970 --> 01:14:06,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's hilarious, Grandpa. Read another one, Greg.

01:14:06,740 --> 01:14:09,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going to change my T-shirt.

791
01:14:19,730 --> 01:14:23,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Hi, Holly. What are you doing here? -I'm visiting my grandmother.

792
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:26,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-She just moved here. -I'm on my grandpa duty.

793
01:14:27,420 --> 01:14:30,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen Greg, I'm really sorry for calling you Fregley the other day.

794
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:34,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I do not know how it happened. I think it's the Greg and Frege part.

795
01:14:34,610 --> 01:14:37,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Did you call me Fregley?

796
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:41,210

797
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:45,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not really, I heard it. It was pretty rough.

798
01:14:45,740 --> 01:14:50,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But don't worry, I have the rest of  middle year to get over it.

799
01:14:50,770 --> 01:14:55,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What happened to your shirt? -My brother spit milk on it.

800
01:14:55,430 --> 01:15:00,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me guess: He was pretending to laugh at something that wasn't actually funny.

801
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:03,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-How would you know? -It's the old siblling hamburg.

01:15:03,790 --> 01:15:07,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Last week, my older sister put  hair remover in my shampoo.

803
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:10,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I hadn't smelled something, I become complete bald right now.

804
01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:13,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Why would she do that? -Because she is my sister.

805
01:15:13,890 --> 01:15:18,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's part of the deal. We fight and then get over it.

806
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:21,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not with my brother. He hates me.

807
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:23,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-And he will never gives up. -Of course he will.

808
01:15:23,590 --> 01:15:25,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He has to.He's your brother.

809
01:15:27,110 --> 01:15:31,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I also have a little sister who spoiled rotten -Tell me about it.

810
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:35,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My little brother ruins all my stuff and finally I'm ended in trouble with.

811
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:37,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Does that drive you mad?

812
01:15:38,980 --> 01:15:43,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Holly，time for dinner. -I gotta go. It was cool hanging out with you.I will look for you tomorrow.

813

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Greg. -See you late.Fregley.

814
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:50,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought being with grandpa is a punishment.

815
01:15:50,270 --> 01:15:54,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But really, it was destiny that Holly was here, too.

816
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:57,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My luck had finally changed.

817
01:16:15,580 --> 01:16:20,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've never believed in fate or destiny or whatever until now.

818
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:26,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Things are finally starting going my way. -Rodrick, be quite. Talk on the phone on somewhere else.

819
01:16:26,410 --> 01:16:28,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought being with grandpa was a punishment.

820

822
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Give up that, Rodrick. -This is priceless.No way.

823

825
01:16:55,100 --> 01:17:00,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can not believe my luck. That Holly is here.

826

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My assistant Scottie got stage fright. Now he doesn't want to do the show.

847
01:20:29,980 --> 01:20:32,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe Greg would help out. He can be your assistant.

848

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's okay, Mrs. Heffley. Greg is just afraid that Holly Hills would think less of him.

851
