Tell me, Henry,

3
00:00:05,078 --> 00:00:07,895
why do you want to be
Mr. Schmidt's assistant?

4
00:00:07,897 --> 00:00:09,080
He's my hero.

5
00:00:09,082 --> 00:00:10,665
I know everything about him.

6
00:00:11,383 --> 00:00:14,518
"Possible stalker."

7
00:00:15,587 --> 00:00:17,755
And why do you think
you're qualified?

8
00:00:17,757 --> 00:00:20,141
Like him,
I graduated high school at 16.

9
00:00:20,143 --> 00:00:22,426
Then I completed the four-year
computer science program

10
00:00:22,428 --> 00:00:23,877
at Harvard
in just under two years,

11
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:26,314
during which,
I founded an Internet startup,

12
00:00:26,316 --> 00:00:29,083
and I'm currently two semesters
shy of my law degree.

13
00:00:29,085 --> 00:00:33,020
So, "no law degree."

14
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:35,189
Let me tell you a few things

15
00:00:35,191 --> 00:00:36,774
about Walden Schmidt
you may not know.

16
00:00:36,776 --> 00:00:38,075
Uh, the man is a genius.

17
00:00:38,077 --> 00:00:39,860
I knew that.

18
00:00:39,862 --> 00:00:42,896
"Likes to interrupt."

19
00:00:43,949 --> 00:00:46,450
He thinks in a different way
than the rest of us.

20
00:00:46,452 --> 00:00:48,569
His mind is always working.

21
00:00:48,571 --> 00:00:49,920
Every time he opens his mouth,

22
00:00:49,922 --> 00:00:51,622
it's because he has
something important to say.

23
00:00:51,624 --> 00:00:53,341
WALDEN:
Love the new toilet paper

24
00:00:53,343 --> 00:00:54,742
you bought, Alan.

25
00:00:54,744 --> 00:00:56,827
It's like sliding
down a rainbow.

26
00:00:57,996 --> 00:01:00,447
Except the pot at the end
doesn't have any gold in it.

27
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:01,916
When you hear something
this good,

28
00:01:01,918 --> 00:01:03,384
you should write it down.

29
00:01:03,935 --> 00:01:05,086
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:05,088 --> 00:01:06,170
Who's this?

31
00:01:06,172 --> 00:01:07,672
Oh, this is, uh, Henry Johnson.

32
00:01:07,674 --> 00:01:09,974
He's interviewing
for the assistant job.

33
00:01:09,976 --> 00:01:12,109
Uh, assistant job?

34
00:01:12,111 --> 00:01:13,711
Hi, Mr. Schmidt.

35
00:01:13,713 --> 00:01:15,096
It's such an honor...
(stuttering)

36
00:01:15,098 --> 00:01:17,248
Eye contact.

37
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,632
It's okay, Henry.

38
00:01:19,851 --> 00:01:21,468
(mouthing)

39
00:01:22,034 --> 00:01:23,719
Alan, can I
talk to you for a second.

40
00:01:23,744 --> 00:01:25,393
Uh, no problem,
Mr. Schmidt.

41
00:01:27,828 --> 00:01:29,186
Tie?
Really.

42
00:01:29,847 --> 00:01:31,239
Not looking good, Hank.

43
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:35,036
What's up?

44
00:01:35,037 --> 00:01:37,771
Why are you interviewing Henry
to be my assistant

45
00:01:37,773 --> 00:01:40,040
when I just hired you
to be my assistant?

46
00:01:40,042 --> 00:01:42,259
Oh, no, no, he's interviewing
to be <i>my</i> assistant.

47
00:01:42,261 --> 00:01:43,560
Your assistant?

48
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:44,878
Well, intern, actually.

49
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,747
He's not gonna cost us a penny,
and he's gonna do

50
00:01:46,749 --> 00:01:48,449
all the menial stuff
I don't want to do.

51
00:01:48,451 --> 00:01:50,917
Well, why don't I
just hire him for free

52
00:01:50,919 --> 00:01:52,303
and cut out the middle man?

53
00:01:52,305 --> 00:01:54,688
And in case I'm going too fast,
you're the middle man.

54
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,256
But I'm the big picture guy.

55
00:01:56,258 --> 00:01:58,392
See, bringing Henry
on to Team Schmidt...

56
00:01:58,394 --> 00:02:00,644
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Team Schmidt?

57
00:02:00,646 --> 00:02:02,146
Yeah, I'm gonna get
hats and shirts made.

58
00:02:02,148 --> 00:02:03,614
Well, Henry is.

59
00:02:03,616 --> 00:02:05,065
We're gonna have a new slogan.

60
00:02:05,067 --> 00:02:07,134
"No bull-Schmidt."

61
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:10,771
"Schmidt happens."

62
00:02:10,773 --> 00:02:13,240
You're a Schmidt head.

63
00:02:15,627 --> 00:02:18,945
I hired you to be my assistant
to help you out financially

64
00:02:18,947 --> 00:02:20,914
'cause you had close
your chiropractic office.

65
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:23,083
I didn't have to close it;
I'm in a rent dispute.

66
00:02:23,085 --> 00:02:25,953
People in rent disputes
don't fake their own death.

67
00:02:25,955 --> 00:02:27,738
(doorbell rings)
Oh, I'll get that.

68
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,907
You are looking good today,
boss.

69
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:31,442
That's why he got
good toilet paper.

70
00:02:31,444 --> 00:02:34,762
So my ass is clean
while he's kissing it.

71
00:02:34,764 --> 00:02:37,398
Huh, my 12:00
must be early.

72
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,983

wanted this job

I mean, I can, but I-I can't.

I mean, how did this happen?

From what my mom told me...

104
00:03:48,013 --> 00:03:51,782
Ooh, can we... can we maybe
turn down the lights?

105
00:03:51,784 --> 00:03:53,800
That's the sun.

106
00:03:53,802 --> 00:03:55,468
Right, I hate the sun.

107
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:58,155
It's like God calling you

108
00:03:59,357 --> 00:04:02,976
Anyway, according to my mom,
it was love at first sight.

109
00:04:02,978 --> 00:04:04,310
They met in a bar,

110
00:04:04,312 --> 00:04:06,480
they got drunk and had sex
in the bathroom.

111
00:04:06,482 --> 00:04:10,083
(chuckles) It was like
a freakin' Disney movie.

112
00:04:11,302 --> 00:04:14,087
Poke-a-hot-ass.

113
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:18,341
And where did the kid go
for the vodka? Poland?

114
00:04:18,343 --> 00:04:20,243
Look, I don't mean
to be rude,

115
00:04:20,245 --> 00:04:22,546
but how do I know that you're
really Charlie's daughter?

116
00:04:22,548 --> 00:04:24,631
I mean, this could be
some kind of scam.

117
00:04:24,633 --> 00:04:26,850
I have a picture of us together.

118
00:04:26,852 --> 00:04:28,451
It's in here somewhere.

122
00:04:33,992 --> 00:04:35,675
Oh, wait, that's not mine.

00:04:37,328 --> 00:04:38,845
Oh, that's mine.

Ah, there you go.

126
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,501
This was taken
at my fourth birthday party.

127
00:04:44,503 --> 00:04:47,654
Just a heads up, I might vomit;
where's the nearest bathroom?

128
00:04:47,656 --> 00:04:48,872
Oh, right down the hall.

129
00:04:48,874 --> 00:04:49,956
Okay, I think we're good,

130
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:51,358
but it's always nice
to have a plan.

131
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:54,244
Anyway, this was party was
the last time I saw him.

132
00:04:54,246 --> 00:04:56,046
After that,
he just sent checks.

133
00:04:56,048 --> 00:04:57,697
He-he sent checks?

134
00:04:57,699 --> 00:04:59,883
Yeah, my mom didn't want him
to have anything to do with me,

135
00:04:59,885 --> 00:05:01,751
but he always made sure
I was taken care of.

136
00:05:01,753 --> 00:05:04,203
He never said a word
about any of this to me.

137
00:05:04,205 --> 00:05:06,223
I'm his brother, his-his blood.

138
00:05:06,225 --> 00:05:07,741
Were they big checks?

139
00:05:07,743 --> 00:05:09,676
Yeah, got one every month.

140
00:05:09,678 --> 00:05:11,044
Bastard.

141
00:05:11,046 --> 00:05:14,364
My mom just called me special.

142
00:05:14,366 --> 00:05:15,632
This Henry guy is awesome.

143
00:05:15,634 --> 00:05:18,568
Did you know I won a
spelling bee in fifth grade?

144
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:22,355
I didn't!

145
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:27,560
Who's this,
Henry's assistant?

146
00:05:27,562 --> 00:05:30,330
Walden, this is Jenny,

147
00:05:30,332 --> 00:05:32,398
my brother's daughter.

148
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,868
Really?

149
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,787
Hi.
Hi.

150
00:05:37,789 --> 00:05:40,807
I, uh, didn't know
Charlie had a daughter.

151
00:05:40,809 --> 00:05:42,459
Neither did I.

152
00:05:42,461 --> 00:05:45,045
He sent her checks,
big checks.

153
00:05:46,047 --> 00:05:47,764
Not that that matters now.

154
00:05:47,766 --> 00:05:49,349
(whispers):
Every month!

155
00:05:50,418 --> 00:05:52,269
Hey, am I related

156
00:05:52,271 --> 00:05:54,621
to Abercrombie & Fitch
over here?

157
00:05:54,623 --> 00:05:57,757
No, I own the house.

158
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,026
Oh. I assumed it was Alan's.

159
00:06:00,028 --> 00:06:03,063
So does he.

160
00:06:03,065 --> 00:06:05,048
So, uh, tell us
more about you.

161
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,700

165
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:15,425
dropped out, became an actress
to piss her off.

Yeah, I was only going
to med school

169
00:06:20,716 --> 00:06:22,766
so I could write myself
prescriptions for oxy.

I got a new mattress,

234
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:45,087

If these walls could talk.

238
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:54,764
They'd probably say,
"Can I get a towel?"

through his mind.

Well, you'd think that,
but the truth is,

252
00:09:26,948 --> 00:09:29,148
when it comes to women,
I've never really been much

253
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,549

kind of guy.

254
00:09:30,551 --> 00:09:32,401
And every time I do
get close to one,

255
00:09:32,403 --> 00:09:33,836
she ends up pulling
away from me,

256
00:09:33,838 --> 00:09:35,738
and then I wind up
back in this room,

257
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:39,058
thinking where I
went wrong again.

258
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,760

259
00:09:42,429 --> 00:09:44,630

I'm-I'm sure you have
a story about Charlie

325
00:12:42,418 --> 00:12:43,701
that doesn't involve drugs.

326
00:12:43,703 --> 00:12:47,004
Okay. One time
at Mardi Gras...

327
00:12:47,006 --> 00:12:48,505
Or alcohol.

328
00:12:48,507 --> 00:12:49,923
All right.

329
00:12:49,925 --> 00:12:51,942
Once when Charlie
was in Vegas...

330
00:12:51,944 --> 00:12:53,894
Or hookers.

331
00:12:53,896 --> 00:12:56,980
Geez, you're really
tying my hands!

332
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,083
Okay, I got it.

333
00:12:59,085 --> 00:13:01,034
It was New Year's Eve,

334
00:13:01,036 --> 00:13:03,704
and Charlie was
super not drunk,

335
00:13:03,706 --> 00:13:06,724
and he was with this
crazy not hooker,

336
00:13:06,726 --> 00:13:10,043
and he decided to have
his sphincter bleached.

337
00:13:10,045 --> 00:13:11,995
Whoa! Whoa!
What?

338
00:13:11,997 --> 00:13:12,963
Why?

339
00:13:12,965 --> 00:13:15,499
Because he cared
about women.

340
00:13:16,684 --> 00:13:20,671
Unfortunately, it got
infected, and he needed me

341
00:13:20,673 --> 00:13:23,757
(voice breaks): to dab
a little ointment...

342
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:25,626
I'm sorry.

343
00:13:25,628 --> 00:13:28,112
It's just that I miss him
so much!

344
00:13:28,114 --> 00:13:30,848
God took the wrong Harper!

345
00:13:31,883 --> 00:13:33,851
(door closes)

346
00:13:33,853 --> 00:13:36,353
EVELYN:
Where is my granddaughter?

347
00:13:36,355 --> 00:13:38,439
Did it just get cold in here?

348
00:13:39,624 --> 00:13:42,392
Oh, my God.

349
00:13:42,394 --> 00:13:44,010
Look at you.

350
00:13:44,012 --> 00:13:45,562
Mom, this is Jenny.

351
00:13:45,564 --> 00:13:46,613
Jenny,

352
00:13:46,615 --> 00:13:48,232
this is Evelyn.

353
00:13:48,234 --> 00:13:50,033
You are so beautiful.

354
00:13:50,035 --> 00:13:52,369
You remind me of me
ten years ago.

355
00:13:53,955 --> 00:13:56,290
Your father was
the apple of my eye.

356
00:13:56,292 --> 00:13:57,791
My greatest gift.

357
00:13:57,793 --> 00:13:59,460
My reason for living.

358
00:14:00,311 --> 00:14:01,361
Uh, hello.

359
00:14:02,247 --> 00:14:04,047
Hello, Alan.

360
00:14:05,032 --> 00:14:09,336
I can't believe
I finally have a grandchild.

361
00:14:09,338 --> 00:14:11,221
You already have
a grandchild-- Jake.

362
00:14:11,223 --> 00:14:14,475
Oh. Sure. Yeah.

363
00:14:15,543 --> 00:14:17,561
So, Jennifer...

364
00:14:17,563 --> 00:14:18,829
Actually, it's Jenny.

365
00:14:18,831 --> 00:14:21,815
Darling, you're not 12 anymore.
It's Jennifer.

366
00:14:21,817 --> 00:14:24,318
We are going to have
so much fun together:

367
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,806
lunching, shopping,
taking care of those eyebrows.

368
00:14:28,808 --> 00:14:30,407
Where are you staying
while you're in town?

369
00:14:30,409 --> 00:14:32,176
I'm crashing on
a friend's couch.

370
00:14:32,178 --> 00:14:34,545
Not anymore.
You'll stay with me.

371
00:14:34,547 --> 00:14:36,947
Aw! I love you, Evelyn.

372
00:14:36,949 --> 00:14:38,248
Whoa, whoa!
If she's staying anywhere,

373
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,433
she's gonna stay at my place.

374
00:14:39,435 --> 00:14:41,451
And by "your place," do you mean

375
00:14:41,453 --> 00:14:44,121
the office that
you stopped paying rent at

376
00:14:44,123 --> 00:14:46,673
or the house that
you've never paid rent at?

377
00:14:46,675 --> 00:14:48,759
Look, I'm not gonna let my mom
screw her up

378
00:14:48,761 --> 00:14:50,010
like she did me and Charlie.

379
00:14:50,012 --> 00:14:52,679
Hey! I was a good mother.

380
00:14:52,681 --> 00:14:54,381
No, you know
who was a good mother?

381
00:14:54,383 --> 00:14:56,466
Our housekeeper Adela.
She even breast-fed me.

382
00:14:56,468 --> 00:14:59,102
She had just had a baby.

383
00:14:59,104 --> 00:15:01,305
And when the milk truck
is parked on the street,

384
00:15:01,307 --> 00:15:03,273
you don't go
to the grocery store.

385
00:15:04,292 --> 00:15:08,228
Besides, you-you used
to gnaw on me.

386
00:15:09,113 --> 00:15:10,731
You're gnawer.

387
00:15:10,733 --> 00:15:12,432
Nang-nang-nang-nang-
nang-nang-nang.

388
00:15:12,434 --> 00:15:15,485
You know what?
She's gonna stay in Jake's room.

389
00:15:15,487 --> 00:15:17,237
Whoa, whoa, no.

390
00:15:17,239 --> 00:15:19,873
I do not want Jake's room
to become Jenny's room.

391
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:22,159
You know, in fact,
there is no Jake's room

392
00:15:22,161 --> 00:15:23,293
and there's no Jenny's room.

393
00:15:23,295 --> 00:15:24,945
There's just Walden's room.

394
00:15:24,947 --> 00:15:27,764
And Charlie's room.

395
00:15:27,766 --> 00:15:29,650
Why don't we let her decide?

396
00:15:29,652 --> 00:15:30,801
Yeah, yeah,
it's up to her.

397
00:15:30,803 --> 00:15:33,503
Is anyone listening to me?!

398
00:15:33,505 --> 00:15:35,405
Jennifer?

399
00:15:35,407 --> 00:15:36,757
Where'd she go?

400
00:15:38,927 --> 00:15:40,227
Nice job, Alan.

401
00:15:40,229 --> 00:15:43,096
You made another woman
disappear.

402
00:15:43,098 --> 00:15:44,297
Can you believe her?

403
00:15:44,299 --> 00:15:46,550
What did I do to her to
make her hate me so much?

404
00:15:46,552 --> 00:15:48,518
Nang-nang-nang-nang-
nang-nang-nang.

405
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,405
Oh, oh. What, you, too?

406
00:15:51,407 --> 00:15:53,974
Oh!

407
00:15:53,976 --> 00:15:55,909
Son of a...

408
00:15:55,911 --> 00:15:57,744
Ooh, a nickel!

409
00:15:57,746 --> 00:15:59,446
♪ <i>Men.</i> ♪

410
00:15:59,448 --> 00:16:01,198
This is ridiculous.

411
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,449
We're never going to find her.

412
00:16:02,451 --> 00:16:04,484
I don't understand
why she ran off like that.

413
00:16:04,486 --> 00:16:06,253
I can think of two reasons.

414
00:16:09,123 --> 00:16:12,826
First I lost my Charlie,
now I've lost my Jennifer.

415
00:16:12,828 --> 00:16:14,511
You still have your Alan.

416
00:16:14,513 --> 00:16:17,014
Oh! Don't make it worse.

417
00:16:18,332 --> 00:16:20,017
Nang-nang-nang-nang-
nang-nang-nang.

418
00:16:21,619 --> 00:16:25,555
Oh, God,
my granddaughter's gone forever.

419
00:16:25,557 --> 00:16:28,392
Oh, there she is
at the bus stop.

420
00:16:28,394 --> 00:16:32,329
Oh, God, my granddaughter
rides the bus!

421
00:16:37,035 --> 00:16:38,869
Jenny, what are you doing?

422
00:16:38,871 --> 00:16:41,438
I'm trying to get away
from you people.

423
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,290
Look, I just wanted to see
where my dad lived.

424
00:16:43,292 --> 00:16:44,925
I didn't want
to screw up your family.

425
00:16:44,927 --> 00:16:46,043
Uh, for the record,

426
00:16:46,045 --> 00:16:47,878
they were screwed up
long before you got here.

427
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,129
It's true.

428
00:16:49,131 --> 00:16:51,048
H-Hey, if I'm screwed up,
it's your fault.

429
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:51,999
You raised me.

430
00:16:52,001 --> 00:16:54,434
I didn't raise you,
Adela did.

431
00:16:54,436 --> 00:16:57,504
Look, I already have
a messed-up family.

432
00:16:57,506 --> 00:16:58,922
I-I don't need another one.

433
00:16:58,924 --> 00:16:59,923
Oh, we're sorry.

434
00:16:59,925 --> 00:17:01,825
This is just how
we express our love.

435
00:17:01,827 --> 00:17:03,927
Through hate.
Oh, no, no, no.

436
00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:05,262
W-We don't hate each other.

437
00:17:05,264 --> 00:17:09,833
I mean, the truth is,
my mother is an amazing woman.

438
00:17:09,835 --> 00:17:11,868
I mean, she-she raised
two kids on her own,

439
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:13,820
she's a successful
businesswoman,

440
00:17:13,822 --> 00:17:17,074
she has impeccable taste.

441
00:17:17,076 --> 00:17:18,391
Thank you, Alan.

442
00:17:19,694 --> 00:17:20,744
Oh, right.

443
00:17:20,746 --> 00:17:23,697
Uh, and Alan is...

444
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:26,950
the reason I had
my tubes tied.

445
00:17:28,052 --> 00:17:31,455
Because she knew she would
never do better than me.

446
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:36,460
Please, sweetheart,
I just found you.

447
00:17:36,462 --> 00:17:37,511
I can't lose you now.

448
00:17:37,513 --> 00:17:39,546
We want you to be a
part of our lives.

449
00:17:39,548 --> 00:17:40,630
What do you say?

450
00:17:40,632 --> 00:17:43,750
Well, if I'm gonna be
a part of this family,

451
00:17:43,752 --> 00:17:45,602
I'm gonna need a drink.

452
00:17:45,604 --> 00:17:47,054
You hear that, Charlie?

453
00:17:47,056 --> 00:17:48,722
Your daughter
needs a drink.

454
00:17:48,724 --> 00:17:51,441
You're looking the
wrong way, Mom.

455
00:17:51,443 --> 00:17:53,377
♪ <i>Men.</i> ♪

456
00:17:54,562 --> 00:17:56,429
A toast.
To Charlie Harper.

457

My brother, your son,
your father, and your...

458
00:18:00,386 --> 00:18:03,236
Guy who got hit by a train
so I could buy his beach house?

459
00:18:04,288 --> 00:18:05,238
Sorry, Evelyn.

460
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,007
It's okay. I got the commission.

461
00:18:07,009 --> 00:18:09,993
To Charlie.

462
00:18:09,995 --> 00:18:13,130
So, is that the bathroom

463
00:18:13,132 --> 00:18:15,415
where the miracle
of my life began?

464
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:18,001
It is.

465
00:18:19,504 --> 00:18:20,470
Want to see it?

466
00:18:20,472 --> 00:18:21,671
I do.

467
00:18:21,673 --> 00:18:23,473
Text a picture of it to my mom.

468
00:18:23,475 --> 00:18:25,425
Should be good
for some guilt money.

469
00:18:25,427 --> 00:18:27,627
I'll run interference.

470
00:18:29,013 --> 00:18:30,147
All right, everybody out!

471
00:18:30,149 --> 00:18:32,632
Woman visiting the place
of her conception!

472
00:18:34,168 --> 00:18:36,236
I can't tell you
how relieved I am

473
00:18:36,238 --> 00:18:38,405
to finally have an heir.
Mm.

474
00:18:38,407 --> 00:18:39,423
Wait, what?

475
00:18:39,425 --> 00:18:41,191
She's my granddaughter.

476
00:18:41,193 --> 00:18:43,143
I want to provide
for her.

477
00:18:43,145 --> 00:18:44,578
And since I wasn't around

478
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,696
for the first 25 years
of her life,

479
00:18:46,698 --> 00:18:48,949
it's only fitting that
she inherit my estate.

480
00:18:48,951 --> 00:18:51,317
You weren't around for
the first 45 years of my life.

481
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:53,170
You have Walden!

482
00:18:53,172 --> 00:18:55,472
Oh, oh, do I? Do you see
a ring on this finger?

483
00:18:55,474 --> 00:18:56,823
Don't worry, darling.

484
00:18:56,825 --> 00:18:59,209
There's a little something
for you in my will.

485
00:18:59,211 --> 00:19:00,043
A little something?

486
00:19:00,045 --> 00:19:01,261
Look, if you knew

487
00:19:01,263 --> 00:19:02,879
you were gonna
get everything,

488
00:19:02,881 --> 00:19:05,265
you would've smothered me
with a pillow years ago.

489
00:19:05,267 --> 00:19:06,616
That is not true.

490
00:19:06,618 --> 00:19:10,353
If I knew I had money coming,
I'd hire a professional.

491
00:19:11,773 --> 00:19:13,557
How'd it go?
Great.

492
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:15,192
I laughed, I cried.

493
00:19:15,194 --> 00:19:18,161
I peed.

494
00:19:18,163 --> 00:19:19,930
How are you guys doing
over here?

495
00:19:19,932 --> 00:19:21,481
Can I get you anything else?

496
00:19:23,434 --> 00:19:25,535
Yeah, we might need
a designated driver

497
00:19:25,537 --> 00:19:27,988
to get us back
to his beautiful beach house.

498
00:19:29,023 --> 00:19:31,158
I'll take you guys.
I get off in 15.

499
00:19:32,493 --> 00:19:34,044
Great. Thanks.

00:19:36,247 --> 00:19:37,697
She's cute.

gets you laid every time.

503
00:19:42,687 --> 00:19:45,005

00:19:52,564 --> 00:19:54,798
Well, it's... Yeah.

507
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,517
And look at
that view.

508
00:19:57,519 --> 00:19:59,269
It's even better
from the bedroom.

509
00:19:59,271 --> 00:20:00,353
Want to see?

510
00:20:00,355 --> 00:20:01,538
Yeah.

511
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,073

00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,542
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

Where are you going?

514
00:20:06,712 --> 00:20:07,878
Up to show her.

515
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,830
Oh, you thought...?

516
00:20:09,832 --> 00:20:12,532
Oh, no-no-no-no-no,
she's mine.

Next time I'll get two.

Good morning.

No, no, not good.

524
00:20:36,354 --> 00:20:38,287
I slept in the guest room
of my own house,

525
00:20:38,289 --> 00:20:41,690
and I'm pretty sure I still have
some of your brother in my ear.

00:20:41,692 --> 00:20:43,092
Don't worry,
tonight I'll tell Jenny

527
00:20:43,094 --> 00:20:44,293
that your bedroom's off limits.

528
00:20:44,295 --> 00:20:45,561
No, there is no tonight!

00:20:46,564 --> 00:20:47,763
Not my family.

531
00:20:47,765 --> 00:20:49,882
And I'm gonna tell her
she can't stay.

Oh, yeah.

535
00:20:56,252 --> 00:20:59,170
I'm surprised I can even talk.

536
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:03,759
You were saying?
Shut up.
