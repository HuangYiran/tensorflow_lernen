1
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:06,030
My father was an innocent man,
destroyed by powerful people

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,620
The Graysons are behind this

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:08,590
They're gonna pay

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,420
I've dedicated my life
to avenging his death

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,640
Eventually,someone's gonna find you out

6
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,740
And I won't stop until
they've all paid the price

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,270
You will always be the clueless
frat boy who crashed your car,

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,620
crushed my spine,and never looked back

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,640
She lost her job

10
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,400
Helping her get another
was the least I could do

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,340
I thought you were set
for life,Sara.I'm sorry

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,740
Why are you doing this,Daniel

13
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,990
To earn your forgiveness

14
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,700
You're the first person in a long
time to be able to make me smile

15
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:39,360
Jack went to Conrad and told him
that Patrick tampered with his brakes

16
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:42,090
He's probably being chased
out of town as we speak

17
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,510
Conrad is a ruthless man.You're not safe

18
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:45,990
- I can't.
- Go.

19
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,700
Growing up,my father said
the ocean was a great escape

20
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,470
As time passed,I also learned that
its expanse holds greater secrets

21
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,330
and the ability to hold mine...

22
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:09,510
And that like love,it is at its heart
fluid,powerful,and sometimes violent

23
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:13,120
Next time you're here, the authorities
will have Victoria in custody

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,560
Soon after,I'll take
you away from everything

25
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:17,700
And everyone

26
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,660
But in its harshest reality,
the ocean is a barrier

27
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:27,720
separating you from those you love

28
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:34,000
When this is done,I'll never
see my sister again... Or Nolan

29
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,370
I know

30
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,270
You'll be okay

31
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:50,500
Are you writing a letter to
Patrick-- Your natural born killer

32
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,300
It's the only means of correspondence

33
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,810
I have to keep away from the
prying eyes of the minions

34
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,370
I'm sure you have looking for him

35
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,720
Why would I waste the time and effort

36
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,350
It's that smug smirk I'm
going to miss the least

37
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,440
after we've converted our money,
and I have left you for good

38
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:11,310
Now there's an action that may compel me to
hire some folks to go looking for your boy

39
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,310
Excuse my confusion,Conrad,

40
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:17,890
but are you threatening
Patrick to keep me by your side

41
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,270
You know,I believe I am...

42
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:24,950
Starting with your magnificent presence
downstairs for the little Grayson confab

43
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,650
you've obviously forgotten about

44
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,370
I've enlisted a PR

45
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,270
specialist to help right
the course of my trajectory

46
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,800
So if you value Patrick's
freedom, you know,

47
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:40,330
you may want to find some public
worth in the family you still have

48
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,450
I still don't see why we're here

49
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,450
If my father wants to rehab
his image, he can do it himself

50
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:50,890
I've already educated
him on re-branding

51
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,590
and how you're all an
extension of his good name

52
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:54,780
I'm a Clarke

53
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:55,920
Whoever you are

54
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,860
That whole "slumming it
in Montauk" thing... Gold

55
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,080
People love it when
the rich help the poor

56
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,310
But where's the bang for my wedding buck

57
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,280
There were no cameras
when you went ring shopping

58
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,310
Has the venue even been announced

59
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,140
Who's making the cake

60
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,820
We are not a very showy couple

61
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:17,540
Is it we?Or is it you?

62
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:23,120
I am damn good at doing my
research, and you're a mystery

63
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,570
You need to be more like Daniel

64
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,720
That publisher's profile is exactly
the kind of rebound story I love

65
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:33,880
Hurt a girl... Tortured
soul... Redemption

66
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,530
And I just hired Sara at the Stowaway

67
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:39,840
- Really?
- We ran into her. It's a long story

68
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,440
One I need to hear

69
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,490
If I am to guide your father
back into America's hearts,

70
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,080
I run the narrative on
this family from here on out

71
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,600
I see you couldn't even extend the courtesy of waiting,
- Ms Preston

72
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,500
- "Bizzy," please.
- Bizzy

73
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,570
It's such a pleasure,Victoria

74
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:58,660
And I figured I might as well get a jump
on the kids so as not to waste your time

75
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,090
While I applaud your gumption,Bizzy,

76
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,640
I feel this Independence
Day party I'm throwing,

77
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,310
along with Emily's wedding shower,

78
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,740
should prove sufficient
for the society papers

79
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:12,080
That won't help if those rags
think that you two are still at odds

80
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,880
The last event you attended led
to a fight worthy of pay-per-view

81
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,220
And since there is little
benefit in positioning Conrad

82
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,740
as master of a house divided,

83
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,390
I need to rewrite your story... Pronto

84
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:26,900
And how do you propose to do that

85
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:30,380
First off,I am plugging
your 4th of July party

86
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,510
as the reintroduction of
the happy Grayson clan,

87
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:37,480
followed by a
mother/daughter-in-law goodwill tour

88
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,590
that I will lay out for you

89
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,050
when the three of us have lunch tomorrow

90
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:47,220
Right there... That's
all I need-- You two

91
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:48,940
And that's what I'm gonna get

92
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,620
Trying to get some scoop on the wedding

93
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,650
They've got big things planned

94
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,260
I'm sure they do

95
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,560
What brings you by

96
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:10,340
I... brought you some
macaroons to welcome you back

97
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,660
Thanks. That's a nice surprise

98
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:16,740
How was LA

99
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:22,560
Wining and dining photographers for Voulez
is not as glamorous as one might think

100
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,090
Oh,really?Weird

101
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,240
I've had a totally different
experience when doing it

102
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,710
I don't suppose you're free tonight

103
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,510
He comes bearing gifts, and
now he's looking for a date

104
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,340
I should leave town more often

105
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:42,880
But no

106
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,300
I have too much work to catch up
on with the wedding approaching

107
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,960
Ah,it'll still be here tomorrow

108
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,290
Don't let the Graysons
take over your life

109
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:00,470
- Hi.
- I've lost my touch

110
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:06,560
A week later,and all I've dug up is a
one-way flight from Philly to Richmond

111
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,950
I just want to know
that Patrick's all right

112
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,190
Well,you should be
happy that he's not here

113
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,400
He would also be scrutinized
by the publicist Conrad hired

114
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,800
She wants me and Victoria
to play nice for the press

115
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,100
Oh,you and
Vicki,besties--

116
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,650
That kind of runs counter to your master
plan of framing her for your murder now

117
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:30,030
Exactly.Which is why PR maven
Bizzy Preston is becoming a problem

118
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,290
that I don't have time for

119
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,240
What,you know her

120
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,650
And loathe her

121
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:43,450
Back in the day,I was,uh,dating this guy

122
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,480
It was casual... fun

123
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:51,380
Then I met his sister--
Up-and-coming pop star,Sage

124
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:58,040
And she was more casual,more
fun... And as it turned out,married

125
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:03,170
The press got ahold of our one-hit
wonder, and Bizzy squashed it...

126
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:05,630
By claiming I was gay

127
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:08,670
I remember when that
happened.It was right when we met

128
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,730
I didn't know that she was behind it

129
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,740
Neither did my father

130
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:18,050
After years of being estranged,

131
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,970
Nolcorp's success had finally
gotten us back on good terms,

132
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:27,500
even planning a visit to New
York to see my R&D facility

133
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:30,690
Programmed a robot to open him a beer

134
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:39,810
Then... He read the press release,
canceled his trip... Never spoke to me again

135
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,580
I'm sorry,Nolan

136
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:48,490
Bizzy's the one who should be sorry

137
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:53,590
And we have to stop you from becoming
the next victim of her PR machine

138
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:56,600
She makes a living covering
her clients' secrets

139
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,140
We just have to expose them

140
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,470
Yeah,but that's not a simple task

141
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,360
She would do anything to protect
'em, and the greater the retainer,

142
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,590
the bigger her allegiance

143
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,260
And I know a family
who's paying top dollar

144
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,160
What are you thinking

145
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,890
She could help us with Victoria
before we make her suffer

146
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,730
It's not that easy

147
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:22,320
She's smart,dangerous,lethal
with information

148
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,000
Well,I'm not afraid to give her some

149
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:29,810
It's time she found out
about my first husband

150

153

whipped up a little something

154
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,440
Is this another attempt to
get desserts put on the menu

155
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,210
Can you blame a girl for trying

156
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,040
I'm glad you joined the crew around here

157
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,730
You're a-- You're a
breath of fresh air

158
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:10,710
Thanks

159
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,910
I got some stuff to do in the storeroom

160
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,420
I was just on my way out to lunch

161
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,020
I hope you don't mind me stopping by

162
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:22,530
Well,it is a bar

163
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,770
That's kinda the point,right

164
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:26,340
You settling in

165
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,670
It's only been a
week,but I can't complain

166
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:31,240
You obviously miss
your job at the bakery

167
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,290
I know that look

168
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,080
It means you got something on the brain

169
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,610
I know this pastry thing has
always been a dream of yours

170
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:43,340
And this might sound crazy,but...

171
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,600
What if you were to make
the cake for my wedding

172
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,200
Right... 'Cause that wouldn't be weird

173
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,260
Only if we make it weird.Come
on.We haven't hired anybody yet

174
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:56,340
You know... When I saw you
the other night after my shift,

175
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,060
I thought you were just
handing me a bunch of crap

176
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,540
about earning my forgiveness

177
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,160
I told you,that's not who I am anymore

178
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:04,020
- I want to help.
- I don't want your charity,Danny

179
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,560
Good,'cause I'm not offering you any

180
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,590
What I am offering is a
chance at a job you want--

181
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,420
One that could be good for you

182
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,070
Think about it

183
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:23,160
Like I said,he'd be perfect for
a profile piece in your magazine

184
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,300
Think about it

185
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,100
Sorry

186
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,890
This thing beats more
often than my heart

187
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:33,060
Especially now that I'm keeping
you all dry under my umbrella

188
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:36,700
Conrad did not tell me just how much
this family was weighing him down

189
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,370
I don't understand.Is that why I'm here

190
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,240
a blogger called about a piece that
I planted about you and Daniel--

191
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:47,900
How socialite Emily Thorne
waited to find her Prince Charming

192
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:48,820
It's... good

193
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:55,940
But... This weasel claims to have
proof that you were hitched before

194
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,490
What

195
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:05,260
I was really young.It was a mistake

196
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,640
I mean,surely you understand

197
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:13,730
Actually... I'm one of the lucky few who
was right about her high school sweetheart

198
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,450
Jeff and I have been
together for 22 years

199
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,290
And we are still as in love
as I'm sure you and Daniel are

200
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,190
This can't get out

201
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:23,170
I'm a gravedigger,babe

202
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:25,010
I bury things bigger than this every day

203
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,380
Good,'cause nobody can
know,especially Victoria

204
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:30,860
We're not really the best of friends

205
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,250
I just can't win with her

206
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,200
If she finds this out,she
will never forgive me

207
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:39,630
Well... I caught the bullet this time

208
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:42,130
But secrets have a way of bleeding out

209
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,710
So let's cut to the chase

210
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,400
What else are you hiding

211
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,700
Nothing,I swear

212
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:00,280
Can I help you with something

213
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:06,570
Conrad's hired a publicist who's determined
to put a sheen on everything we do,

214
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,550
including promoting this wedding,

215
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,080
which if we don't act quickly,
it'll be too late to do anything

216
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,380
I thought you were relying on Jack Porter
- to break them up

217
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,680
- I've heard that he's
courting Ms Lemarchal

218
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,770
So clearly that won't
be coming to fruition

219
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,650
- Then we'll find another way.
- Oh,we won't

220
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,960
You will

221
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,130
My son has no shortage
of hatred towards you

222
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,670
So get back in Emily's life...
And more importantly,her bed

223
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,850
The blogger persona was convincing

224
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:40,680
Let's just hope Bizzy spreads
the news like I want her to

225
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:41,810
Oh,trust me

226
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,770
She knows that sharing information like
that keeps her on the Grayson payroll

227
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:51,530
And once she does,the two of
us will Biz-mantle her with glee

228
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,070
You sure you're up for it,Grandpa

229
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:58,650
I'm not getting older,just... wiser

230
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:04,800
But trying to unearth Bizzy's clients'
secrets is taking longer than I thought

231
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:08,450
Hacking her proton 5 firewall
will take time that I don't have

232
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,490
Why the look

233
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,430
If this had happened a few years ago,

234
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:16,780
you would have thrown a martini
in her face and called it a day

235
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,470
But now... I'm standing up for myself

236
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,160
I just... Buried the pain of
what happened with my father,

237
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:31,690
but because of you,I'm
not just facing it

238
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:33,280
I'm doing something

239
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:37,220
I've learned a lot from you,Ems

240
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,380
We made a great team

241
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,580
Well,if we're gonna win...
We're gonna need a new game plan

242
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:50,580
I don't have the time for this firewall,
so we've got to get her password

243
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,580
Except that phone never leaves her hands

244
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,240
Maybe it doesn't need to

245
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,500
I'm glad I decided to
take the evening off

246
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,780
It's beautiful out here,isn't it

247
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,700
Yeah,it's like your own little sanctuary

248
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:30,250
Where no one can find us

249
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,210
- What.Have I done something wrong?
- No.No

250
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:58,820
It's... Let's just try to enjoy the
movie and have another glass of wine

251
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:04,290
Unless... I can go downstairs
and make another drink

252
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,600
No,I don't need anything from the bar

253
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,410
Wine it is,then

254
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,900
That's not what I meant

255
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,530
Okay,I think it's best if I go

256
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,640
- Margaux.
- It's okay.I have an early morning

257
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,480
Enjoy your beautiful evening

258
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:39,340
You're late

259
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,270
Daniel held me up

260
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,060
He wants his ex-girlfriend
to make our wedding cake

261
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,910
He set up a tasting at my house tomorrow

262
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:48,320
Do you suspect something's amiss

263
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:51,000
No.I'm sure he's doing it out of guilt

264
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,020
Daniel's the reason I
needed to meet with you

265
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,090
Victoria's compelled me
to get back into your orbit

266
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,050
in order to drive a wedge
between the two of you

267
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,600
Well,that's not an option,not
this close to the wedding

268
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,290
Yeah,but if I don't see it through,
I may lose access to the Graysons

269
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,390
Maybe there's a third way

270
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,120
And that is

271
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,270
To be seen together...

272
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,930
This is the last one,I promise

273
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,000
Are you kidding me?Each one's
been better than the last

274
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:30,910
Are these family recipes

275
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,580
Yeah,passed down from my mom's side

276
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,210
Well,your mom taught you well

277
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:37,380
Well,she raised me and my
brother after my dad ditched us,

278
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:41,860
so everything I know I learned from
her,including how to make a mess

279
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,890
I am so sorry about this disaster

280
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,050
Oh,don't worry about it

281
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,720
But... I better stop,or I'll be
full for my lunch with Victoria

282
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:52,010
Well,if it'd help make the
lunch shorter, I'd say eat up

283
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:55,550
Thanks again... For giving me a shot

284
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:58,520
Of course.Thank you .See ya

285
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:02,210
Hey... I really appreciate
you considering this

286
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,890
It's just something I...
I want to do,you know

287
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:05,900
It's a great thing that you're doing

288
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:09,840
And I... I think she'll
make a wonderful wedding cake

289
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:11,350
Me,too

290
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:12,850
I'll see you later,okay

291
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:17,530
- You got the job.
- Shut up

292
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:20,030
- Seriously?
- I'm serious

293
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,800
Man,she is way more mature than I am

294
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:28,540
I mean... Letting your fiancé's
ex make your wedding cake--

295
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,660
If the tables were turned,

296
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,100
I would be so jealous and would
have canceled the whole thing

297
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,670
Oh,well,that's Emily

298
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:39,140
And you... Even asking her to let
me make the cake-- That took guts

299
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,310
I mean,what if these were awful

300
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:41,370
I knew they wouldn't be

301
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:45,060
I gotta say that,uh... Forgiveness
thing you were looking for...

302
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,280
This goes a long way toward it

303
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:53,780
-  Well...I should clean up.
- Okay

304
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,200
Hey,let me help you .I got it

305
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:57,670
- I can help
- No,Danny,you hired me.It's my job

306
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,570
Then I'm giving you
the rest of the day off

307
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:00,830
Go home

308
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,200
So... How was your date with Margaux

309
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,850
Things were fine...
Until... they weren't

310
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,520
- Okay.What happened .
- I don't know

311
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,310
She just-- She left
in the middle of it

312
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,870
What,for no reason.What's up,Jack

313
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:30,950
I just... I blew it

314
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,540
I mean,I didn't want to,but
I just-- I couldn't handle it

315
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,270
You know what this is,right

316
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:47,390
- Yeah.
- I think... Maybe it's time to face it

317
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:57,710
I must admit,I was a bit surprised
when I heard from your publicist

318
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,370
So she tells me you're
looking for some press coverage

319
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,370
Oh,uh,there must be some confusion

320
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:07,960
What Ms Preston offered
you was an exclusive

321
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,750
Conrad Grayson is back

322
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:14,320
He's a survivor... A
laudatory profile of sorts

323
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:15,730
It's out of the question

324
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:18,260
We have to maintain
journalistic integrity

325
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,580
And covering Daniel's wedding
isn't a conflict of interest

326
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,930
Touché,Mr Grayson

327
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:27,840
But there is a difference
between a society piece

328
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,860
and an advertisement for you

329
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:36,880
Now,if you were to give me access
to all your papers and... archives...

330
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,440
Then maybe we could talk

331
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,550
Ms Lemarchal,I'm not
here to dwell on the past

332
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,890
Well,if you're not willing
to be totally honest with me,

333
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,980
I'm not comfortable moving forward

334
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:50,330
But I'm sure there's a
story in you no one expects

335
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,370
You just need the guts to tell it

336
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:58,990
You see how easy this is

337
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,510
With you two on the same page,

338
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:05,520
it won't pull focus as we can
ease Conrad back into the spotlight

339
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,160
Well,this itinerary is too aggressive

340
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,980
Surely the 200 people I'm hosting
this evening means I've done my duty

341
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:16,430
You know better than most that
changing public opinion takes time

342
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:19,360
And I have mere weeks
until everyone sees you

343
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:23,350
as the new ideal of a mother and
daughter-in-law - at the bridal shower

344
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,590
That should be an interesting challenge

345
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,250
Not for women of your stature

346
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:32,080
If your conflict creates such sparks,
imagine what a partnership can do

347
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:33,860
Well,I'd certainly marvel to see it

348
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:36,520
Aiden,what a coincidence

349
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,560
Well,in-- In
truth,it's not

350
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:43,100
I know I'm-- I'm being forward,
but I was hoping to steal Ms Thorne

351
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,870
I have nothing to say to you

352
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,950
Why don't you go,Emily

353
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,040
You clearly have things to resolve

354
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,790
Thank you for lunch,Bizzy

355
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:59,140
- Of course.
- After you.Thank you

356
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,070
Sweet girl

357
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,250
Emily obviously craves your approval

358
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,730
You know,I would have assumed that
paying top dollar for a flat meant

359
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:12,900
that Conrad got someone who
is better at reading people

360
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,720
Yes.Well,on
second thought,I--

361
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:20,560
Which is why I'm loathe to parade
around on a goodwill tour with her,

362
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:23,570
not to mention her unresolved
feelings for Aiden Mathis

363
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,630
He's her ex,too

364
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,580
She is determined to make
me earn my keep,isn't she

365
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:30,910
"Too"

366
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:35,270
Well,I probably shouldn't tell you this,

367
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,530
but young Emily was married once before

368
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,510
I beg your pardon

369
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,500
Don't worry. It was a mistake

370
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,980
I'm sure that's all there is to it

371
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,230
One can never be too certain

372
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:50,080
She was young.She was in love

373
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,690
Did she happen to mention a name

374
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:55,080
- Oh,I don't remember.
- Ronald... Roger

375
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,510
I'm sure I have it at the office

376
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:59,200
Well,perhaps you can do
some investigating for me

377
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:00,890
And the takedown is all yours,Nolan

378
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,360
I'm sure the Graysons' 4th
of July party will serve

379
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,120
as the perfect backdrop,don't you think

380
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:10,270
Well... Let the fireworks begin

381
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:27,080
- Nice to see you.- Take
care.- Hey,Mom.- Quick photo

382
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:33,670
Yeah.Okay. Well,Bizzy's certainly
making this an event to remember

383
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,950
She's documenting
every living inch of it

384
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:39,290
Well,I'm sure she'll be excluding Aiden,

385
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:42,680
seeing as he dragged your
fiancée out of lunch today

386
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,030
Emily told you,I'm sure

387
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,600
I think he's trying to
rekindle the relationship

388
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,390
Do you have to read into everything

389
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,030
Just try and enjoy yourself

390
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:53,120
- Hello,gentlemen.
- Hi

391
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:56,040
The who's who of the
Hamptons is out in full force

392
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,050
I'd say we're a success

393
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:02,980
Oh,and I have feelers out
for info on husband number one

394
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:05,580
Speaking of which,I
should probably find mine

395
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:10,350
Why don't we keep our little fact
finding mission to ourselves,shall we

396
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:15,040
Mother... You remember Sara

397
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:19,960
Of course

398
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:23,530
Oh,Ms Munello,I don't
mean to be indelicate,

399
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,180
but wouldn't you be far more comfortable

400
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,330
watching the fireworks
in the field somewhere

401
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,540
Well,Charlotte was nice enough
to let me class it up tonight--

402
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,010
Pretend to be the one percent

403
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,280
Of what exactly,dear

404
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,140
Can I get you a refill

405
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,650
'Cause I could sure use a drink

406
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,180
Why on earth did you invite
that girl back into our house

407
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:52,020
Because I care about Daniel too
much to see him marry the wrong woman

408
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:55,050
And I don't think Emily's
the one to make him happy

409
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:57,950
You know I concur in
spades,but that doesn't explain

410
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:00,510
the need to trot in
somebody off the rack

411
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:01,710
Wake up,Mother

412
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:05,770
I'm sure Daniel still has feelings for
Sara, and she still has feelings for him

413
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,030
They just need help remembering that

414
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:12,640
So you think that Sara could be the
one who would put a stop to this wedding

415
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,730
Well,if you weren't so
focused on hating Emily

416
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:20,180
and were more focused on worrying
about Daniel, you might see it,too

417
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:34,130
So okay... proud of
me.I'd expect nothing less

418
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,560
Bizzy Preston... In the flesh

419
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:46,770
Nols.It's been ages

420
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,850
Darling,you look marvelous

421
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:51,650
Likewise,and,uh,who's the arm candy

422
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:53,660
This is my husband Jeff

423
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:55,150
Jeff,this is Nolan Ross

424
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:56,970
of course.Pleasure to meet you,Nolan

425
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:58,300
Oh,the pleasure is all mine

426
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,960
You dabble in PR as well?

427
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,660
Oh,no,no. I let my wife
stay in the spotlight

428
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:04,860
She's good at it

429
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,570
She is dedicated to her clients

430
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:12,700
You know,come to think of it,the
last time we crossed paths,

431
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,790
you were a bad girl,outing
me like that in the press

432
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,530
You mean that whole "Sage" thing

433
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,190
You're welcome

434
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:24,310
I took you out of the tech pages, and
I made you interesting to real people

435
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:26,210
You did bring out my inner Armani

436
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,380
And besides,who could
stay mad at that face

437
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,750
You just earned a cocktail

438
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:11,320
I wore this for one
night as a married man,

439
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,950
and I've worn it ever
since to honor you...

440
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:19,740
Maybe subconsciously to convince people

441
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:24,890
that I had someone to share
my days with,and... And nights

442
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,620
But I don't anymore

443
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,730
It's time for me to try to move on

444
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,230
I miss you with all my heart

445
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:04,740
I'm serious .The orange
jumpsuit washed me out

446
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:07,360
So I said I preferred the
black and white stripes

447
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:08,420
They wouldn't budge

448
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:10,200
You are too much

449
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,390
You two seem to be having a good time

450
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:14,960
Oh,Emily,you are so lucky to
have this one at arm's length

451
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:17,060
God,the trouble you two must get into

452
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:18,400
Nothing worth publicizing

453
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,300
I was gonna ask you,

454
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:22,220
what time is that museum
fund-raiser on Monday

455
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,590
Victoria would kill me if I'm late

456
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:25,880
- As will I?
- Let me check

457
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,300
Where are my readers

458
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:31,030
Oh,here,these, These are mine

459
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:34,430
Oh,thank you,Nols.My little lifesaver

460
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,010
10:00

461
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:42,290
And it is very important that you two put on
- a good show,my dear

462
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:43,780
I will behave,I promise

463
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,200
- Enjoy the party .
- Thank you

464
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,040
Now,where were we

465
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:51,400
Well,I was just about to
get,uh,another cocktail

466
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,580
What's your poison

467
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,200
Surprise me

468
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:59,410
- Okay.
- Oh,hi

469
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,000
Thank you,Nols,my little lifesaver

470
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:32,730
If it's a surprise you want,
I'm more than happy to oblige

471
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,280
You're looking dashing
this evening,Ms Thorne

472
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,070
As are you,MrMathis

473
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:55,930
Well,I see you two have made peace

474
00:28:56,380 --> 00:29:01,240
We're trying,Victoria,seeing as you obviously
intend on having us both in your life

475
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,410
Oh,aren't you kind

476
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:05,170
But don't do anything on my behalf

477
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,800
Well,that wasn't part of the plan

478
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,270
Victoria forced my hand

479
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,870
I had no choice but to be seen with you

480
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:15,100
Mm,don't get used to it

481
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,240
Getting chummy with Aiden again

482
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:21,090
Oh,we're just at the same party,Daniel

483
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,150
What did he have to say

484
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,240
Does it matter

485
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,330
I'm just making the
best of a bad situation

486
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:27,590
Don't tell me you're jealous

487
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:33,970
-No No,I'm not
- Good

488
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:36,140
I was gonna go get some
food,if you want to join

489
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:39,500
- In a minute I got a couple people I need to talk to.
-Okay

490
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,850
Word around the party is that
Conrad Grayson is writing his memoirs

491
00:29:59,050 --> 00:29:59,930
Is this true

492
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:03,070
Indeed it is.Will you excuse us

493
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:06,030
So you've decided to
discuss your past after all

494
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,040
Well,you were right

495
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,450
The public deserves it

496
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,480
I plan to give it to them in my own way

497
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,770
Well,I would love to talk more about it

498
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,040
Perhaps tomorrow morning at my office

499
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,380
I'm afraid that ship has sailed

500
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:24,770
I don't want mere excerpts
for Voulez,MrGrayson

501
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,790
- No
- I want your whole book

502
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,690
Have you forgotten Lemarchal
has a publishing arm

503
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,950
- Well,then tomorrow morning it is.
- Okay

504
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:47,420
Hey. Look,I'm sorry
about the other night

505
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,930
- It's been a rough year

506
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:52,680
- I can't imagine

507
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:57,540
Look,I haven't brought it up because
I felt you didn't wanna talk about it

508
00:30:58,750 --> 00:30:59,520
I didn't

509
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:02,650
That's... part of the problem

510
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:09,930
But... I hope that you'll
give me another chance

511
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:15,300
You took off your ring

512
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:37,370
What do you say we go watch
the fireworks on your roof

513
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:58,150
Hey.I brought you a jacket

514
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,350
Hope you're not hiding from my mother

515
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,870
She doesn't scare me anymore

516
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,270
But,man,does she still try

517
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:09,190
Yeah,she tends to go all out.
- Clearly

518
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,140
Yeah,I wouldn't miss this show

519
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:17,420
I remember my mom taking
us kids out every weekend

520
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,800
during the season to
see them on Coney Island

521
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,030
Yeah,Friday nights on
the boardwalk.9:30 sharp

522
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,370
Oh,you've been

523
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:27,030
Best seats in the house
are between 10th and 15th

524
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,560
- Never missed it as a kid.
- No way

525
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:34,490
Of course,I was with my
nanny,but... Who knows

526
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:36,570
Maybe we met once at the hot dog stand

527
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:48,290
If you had told me I'd ever be
back here sitting next to you

528
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:56,050
- Well... Things change .
- Yeah

529
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:58,350
Guess you're right

530
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,420
You're hacking Bizzy's phone here

531
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,290
What if somebody saw you

532
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,220
What? I got excited

533
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:20,460
Plus I waited till she left

534
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:22,190
Did you get what you needed

535
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:23,890
And so much more

536
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:28,420
Check out this string of dirty
texts from Ms Preston herself

537
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,030
Wait Trevor

538
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:32,990
- I thought her husband's name was Jeff.
- It is.

539
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:40,660
Seems our dear Bizzy has been getting
busy covering up stories of her own

540
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:42,680
Drink

541
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,780
I don't want us to rush anything

542
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,240
We can go up and watch the fireworks

543
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:28,260
What's this

544
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:34,330
It's the 4th of July, the day we Americans
celebrate ridding ourselves of the British

545
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:37,380
But I'm making progress

546
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:38,710
I have Emily in good graces

547
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:43,040
Well,your sad attempts at wooing her
have failed to have their desired effect

548
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,750
Daniel's unconcerned with
your renewed relationship

549
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,010
Well,then I'll change his mind

550
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:49,340
Oh,but you don't seem to understand

551
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:52,180
I'm declaring my independence

552
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:56,470
Victoria,you can't deny that
we've made a good team thus far,

553
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:01,150
and... besides... You
can't do this alone

554
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:04,180
Oh,you underestimate me,Mr Mathis

555
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:07,110
Yet another reason why
your time here is over

556
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:12,100
So if you don't mind...
Get the hell out of my house

557
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:31,100
- What happened?
- I don't know .Victoria's gone crazy

558
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,590
She just kicked me out on a whim

559
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,530
Means she's got something
else up her sleeve

560
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:36,120
And I'll be damned if I
don't find out what it is

561
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:37,350
Just don't overreact

562
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:38,580
I don't want her to get suspicious

563
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,060
Well,then what can I do to help

564
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,490
Just go make sure everything's
ready for when this is done

565
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,410
Come back when the dust settles

566
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,530
Well,at least I get to
say good-bye this time

567
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:22,600
Here you go

568
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,410
If you want something
fancier,I can run downstairs

569
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:27,070
Oh,do you have an espresso machine

570
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,440
No,no,I just meant I
can put it in a nicer mug

571
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:32,500
Okay

572
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,000
Oh,I'm afraid I need
to get to the office

573
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,710
Stay for breakfast

574
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:41,910
I make a mean pancake

575
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,180
Rain check,please

576
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:47,390
No,I'm hearing a book
proposal this morning,

577
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:50,440
and I imagine Conrad
Grayson waits for no one

578
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,080
- Conrad
.- Mm-hmm

579
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,850
What's he pitching,a book of lies

580
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:00,010
Probably,but that doesn't
mean I can't get the real story

581
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:04,120
I have a feeling it's much more
interesting than any of us know

582
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:12,600
- Hi
- Great party last night

583
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:15,240
Can you believe the
Graysons are trending

584
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:16,600
Oh,I can

585
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,860
You do anything for
your clients,don't you

586
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,150
Even if it hurts someone else

587
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:27,920
Are you still on about that story
I planted in the press years ago

588
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:31,580
Oh You mean the one
that nearly destroyed me

589
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,670
That left me feeling completely alone,

590
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,140
that cost me the last ten
years of my father's life

591
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:41,890
Yeah You did that

592
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,440
So why are you here

593
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:46,930
For payback

594
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:53,530
Well... See,at first, I was just going
to out all of your clients' secrets,

595
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,500
but then I thought,well,it's
not their fault

596
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,150
they have drug and anger issues

597
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:01,840
Oh,and that,guy with the
thing for the diapers...

598
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:02,920
How do you know about that

599
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,410
That is totally secure information

600
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,410
Little birdie told me

601
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:12,280
And then... Sent e-mails
to all your clients,

602
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:15,500
explaining how sloppy you
are at guarding their sins

603
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:16,630
You'll destroy my career

604
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:19,310
Ah,well,Bizzy,I already did

605
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:26,230
And... Now that you're officially
out of business, you're mine

606
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:30,250
Now if and when I need you,I'll call

607
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:33,170
Otherwise,that phone stays silent

608
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:37,260
And that includes sexting Trevor Vance

609
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,190
I don't know who that is

610
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,020
Then why do you visit his house
in Westport three nights a week

611
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:51,040
Nolan... Jeff's... He's a good man

612
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:54,350
And it would kill him if he found out

613
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:04,350
All right

614
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:06,920
Then I'll give
you a choice--

615
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,430
One that you never had the courtesy
to extend to me all of those years ago

616
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:16,660
End the affair... Today

617
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:21,730
Go back to the man
that clearly loves you

618
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:28,730
Otherwise... I tell him the truth

619
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:36,170
I am sorry... About what
happened with your father

620
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,810
I've waited ten years to hear that

621
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,010
It's just too bad he never will

622
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:11,000
I wanted to apologize for my
coldness toward you last night

623
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:14,660
It's a long way to hike for two
words you can say on the phone

624
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:16,700
Well,then would you
indulge me for a few more

625
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,720
I know that Daniel once fancied you

626
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,090
and that I wasn't the most
receptive to your presence

627
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,230
You think

628
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:28,780
That's because I didn't fully understand

629
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,810
how important his happiness
was to me... Exclusive of my own

630
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:35,470
What are you saying

631
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:37,830
That I think that you
may be the one for Daniel

632
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,470
Daniel's getting married in a month

633
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:44,690
But you must have stopped to wonder if

634
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:47,110
that was only because he
lost you three years ago

635
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:53,770
I know that you and I
didn't get along in the past,

636
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,460
but perhaps we could work
together towards a common goal

637
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,410
My museum fund-raiser's canceled

638
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,840
I imagine I have you to thank for that

639
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:18,370
- Bizzy will be anything but for a while
- Thanks

640
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,030
Though when it was time
to go in for the kill,

641
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:22,560
I couldn't pull the trigger

642
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,590
I actually saved her marriage

643
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:28,650
Guess my takedowns have a silver lining,

644
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,010
It's kind of fun being your wingman

645
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,630
I taught you well,grasshopper

646
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,240
You know,actually,you did,Nolan

647
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:47,350
Two years ago,I never would've thought

648
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:54,860
I'd have a partner in all
this... Or a real friend

649
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:07,320
Well,you, Might wanna wait
on our freeze-frame high five

650
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:13,040
My glasses accidentally pocket-recorded
portions of last night's party

651
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:15,980
Allow me to jump to the lowlight

652
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:26,220
Wait for it... That's why
Daniel wasn't upset about Aiden

653
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:30,760
Looks like they're about
to rekindle their past

654
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:34,450
Then I have to make
sure they have no future

655
