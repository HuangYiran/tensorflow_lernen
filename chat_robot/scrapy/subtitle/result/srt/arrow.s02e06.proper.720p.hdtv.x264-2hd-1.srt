2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,570
经过岛上的五年炼狱生活
After five years on a hellish island,

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,250
我回家只有一个目的 
拯救我的城市
I have come home with only
one goal-- to save my city.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,090
我不能再像以前一样成为杀手
But to do so,I can't be
the killer I once was.

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,660
为祭奠我的朋友 我必须扮成某人
To honor my friend's memory,
I must be someone else.

6
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,490
我必须掩盖身份
I must be something else.

7
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,280
绿箭侠 前情提要
尽管我很想让这个城市变得更安全
Previously on "Arrow"... As much as
I would love to make this city safer,

Consolidated and yours is,too.

9
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,260
我仔细调查了Lawton
I did some reading up on Lawton.

10
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,440
- Lyla 听着 
- 你以为我不知道是他杀了你弟弟吗
Lyla,listen-- Did you really think I
wouldn't find out that he killed your brother?

11
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:40,790
你在利用我
That you were using me?

12
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,670
他必须死
I need to see this guy in a bag.

13
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,130
你应该比其他任何人都懂
You,of all people,should get that.

14
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:49,460
好久不见 
尤其是黑手党首领 Queen先生
Long time particularly for
Bratva captain.Mr.Queen.

Anatoly Knyazev, he speaks
very highly of you.He should.

我救过他
I saved his life.

17
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,230
你应该在上次董事会上
就签了这份报告的
You were supposed to sign this
report at last night's board meeting.

18
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,070
知道为什么没签吗
You know why you didn't?

19
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,960
也许是因为上次会议我没参加
Probably because I didn't attend
last night's board meeting.

20
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:17,920
那你在哪
Where were you?

21
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:20,140
除了这个公司之外我还有别的业务
I have other interests
outside of this company.

22
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,190
我没有
I don't.

23
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,830
Queen先生 你说我们是合伙人
我以为你是认真的
Mr.Queen-- I thought you were serious
when you said we were partners.

24
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,390
Isabel 我只不过没参加一次会议
Isabel,I missed one meeting.

25
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,490
那是这周 上周还有两次
This week.Last week,it was two meetings.

26
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:30,460
Queen先生
Mr.Queen.

27
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:34,380
自从我们接管后 公司收入急速增长
Companywide revenue is at double
digits since you and I took over.

28
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,910
- Oliver

29
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:39,700
抱歉打扰你们了

我们还有活要干 这很重要

34
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,310
我今晚的安排也很重要

35
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,360
失陪
I'm sorry.

36
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,600
我们得给你想点高明的借口
We are going to have
to work on your excuses.

37
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,250
没错
You're right.

38
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,310
你应该多加防备
You should be more careful.

39
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,530
你现在完全暴露在外
You're completely exposed.

40
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:25,230
我知道你在
I knew you were there.

41
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,740
你要我告诉你
贩卖假钞的人什么时候行动
What,you wanted me to tell you when the
funny money guys were ready to make a sale?

42
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:30,500
我们现在可以开始了
Here we go.

43
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,980
没有我们 你回家
Not "we." Go home.

44
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,360
我有帮手
I already have help.

45
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,160
这是假货
Here's the fake.

46
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,030
再看看真货
Let's see the real.

47
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,750
你右上方有两个
You got two right above you.

48
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,610
六点钟方向还有一个
Another at your six.

49
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,480
住手 别动
Stay where you are,don't move!

50
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,850
我在执行公民逮捕

51
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:26,740
别动
Don't move.

52
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,150
完事了 我撤了
That's it.I'm clear.

53
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,790
X特遣队呼叫知更鸟
Task force X to Mockingbird.

54
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,510
目标到手 我们回来了
We have the prize,we're coming home.

国家安全局 情报局

我是Amanda Waller

61
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,020
我以为你们做事会精细点
I thought you A.R.G.U.S.guys
were supposed to be more subtle.

62
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,480
对我们来说算精细了
For us,this was subtle.

63
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:17,630
我要见Lyla Michaels
Then I want to see Lyla Michaels.

64
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,360
我也想
So do I.

65
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,870
Michaels特工已经不知去向
Agent Michaels has gone dark.

66
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,050
Lyla失踪了吗
Lyla's missing?

67
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:23,990
怎么回事
What happened?

68
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,730
她去莫斯科查一个线索
She was running down a lead in Moscow.

69
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,180
她已经缺席了两次日常电话报告

her scheduled call-ins.

70
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,370
那你们打算怎么办
Well,what are you doing about it?

71
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,290
找你谈话
Speaking to you.

72
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,140
即使我们知道Lyla具体在俄罗斯哪
Even if we knew where in Russia Lyla is,

73
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,320
我的上级也会认为再派出一支部队
my superiors believe
sending in an extraction team

74
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,760
会引起国际纠纷
could cause an international incident.

75
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,990
对他们来说 Lyla已经死了
As far as they're concerned, she's
already a framed picture on our lobby wall.

76
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,250
为什么告诉我这些
Why are you telling me all this?

77
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:53,520
因为我知道你和Oliver Queen
每天晚上在忙些什么
Because I know how you and
Oliver Queen spend your nights.

78
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,040
我也知道你的护照还没过期
And I know your passport is up to date.

79
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,740
那你告诉我Lyla去莫斯科干什么
It would help to start with what Lyla
was doing in Moscow in the first place.

80
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,820
她要找什么线索
What was this lead
she was tracking down?

81
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,780
Floyd Lawton的下落

死亡射手

83
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,150
Lyla去俄罗斯是为了我
Lyla was in Russia for me,

84
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:16,670
Michaels特工对我有不可取代的价值
Agent Michaels is an asset
I can't easily replace.

85
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,070
我知道你也认为她是不可取代的
I know you find her
similarly irreplaceable.

86
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,610
把她带回来 Diggle
Bring her home,Mr.Diggle.

87
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:37,920
谢谢
Thanks.

88
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,680
好久没逮捕你了
It's been a while since I arrested you.

89
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,710
我都忘了那感觉多好了
I'd forgotten how good it feels.

90
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,630
我在为他做事
I was working for...him.

91
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,180
哪个他
Him who?

92
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,280
你在掩护的那个人
The guy who cost you your shield.

93
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,360
我和他是一伙的
I'm on his team.

94
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,430
你也是
You are,too.

95
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,550
似曾相识的感觉啊
Anybody else having serious deja vu?

96
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:01,660
没关系 我们正要放了他
That's all right,we're letting him go.

97
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,020
我们搞错了
Our mistake.

98
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,590
他只是在错误的时间
出现在了错误的地点
He was just in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

99
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:17,270
好吧 趁有人改变主意前 
我们抓紧离开这里吧
Ok,uh,let's just get out of here
before anyone changes their mind.

100
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:27,240
打开这台机器可能导致的灾难性后果
The potentially catastrophic
risk of turning on this machine

101
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,360
远大于其可能带来的科学收获
far outweigh any scientific
gain that might come from it.

102
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,360
人们必须明白像这样的技术有多危险
The people need to understand just
how dangerous technology like this is.

103
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:38,160
以及其可能导致的灾难性事件
And the very real possibility
of a cataclysmic event.

104
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,840
你去哪儿了
Where'd you go?

105
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:44,190
没出什么事吧
Is everything ok?

106
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:45,810
没事
Yeah.

107
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,780
只是要请几天假处理一些私事
Just need a few personal days.

108
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,850
发生什么了
What's going on?

109
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,040
得去帮朋友一个忙

110
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,800

It's his spy girlfriend
that works for A.R.G.U.S.

113
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,520
她去了俄国找死亡射手 为了我
She went to Russia looking
for Deadshot, for me.

114
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,420
现在她失踪了
Now she's missing.

Felicity... I think it's time we visited
our Queen Consolidated subsidiary in Moscow.

116
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:10,710

Yeah.

117
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,010

118
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,910
只是帮朋友一个忙
Just need to help a friend.

119
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,020
我不能要求你这么做
I can't ask you to do that.

120
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,150
你没有要求我
You didn't.

121
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,280
- Sara

How did you come to be
on this island,Tommy?

126
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:45,440
我想不会是你自愿来的吧
I assume it wasn't by choice.

127
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,430
我的船遇到了海难
My,uh... Boat was shipwrecked here.

128

很遗憾听到这个消息

133
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:10,150
你不会刚好发现了一艘
日本皇家海军的潜艇吧 有没有
You didn't happen to run across a
Japanese Imperial Navy submarine,did you?

134
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:19,060
二战时 每个国家都在研究终极武器
During World War II, every country was
trying to develop the ultimate weapon.

135
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:23,400
美国有曼哈顿计划 不必多说
The United States had the
Manhattan Project,of course;

136
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,540
德国搞了"铀俱乐部"
the Nazis had das Uranverein.

137
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:30,420
至于日本人 他们开发了Mirakuru
And the Japanese,well,
they had Mirakuru.

138
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:33,280
干细胞和基因疗法 领先时代数十年
Stem cell and genetic therapies,
decades ahead of their time.

139
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,350
每次战争 都会促进科学进步
Every war advances the cause of science.

140
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:45,110
日本人发明了一种血清
可以增加力量
And the Japanese,they had developed a
serum that caused increased strength.

141
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,240
促进细胞再生
Rapid cell regeneration.

142
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,360
他们称之为Mirakuru
They called it Mirakuru.

143
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,740
"奇迹"
"Miracle.

144
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:55,410
他们以为能创造出一支
由超级战士组成的军团
" Thought they could create
an army of super soldiers.

145
00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:00,640
他们用一艘潜艇运输唯一一批血清
They were transporting their
only supply via submarine

146
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,870
结果这艘潜艇遭到了盟军强大火力
when that sub came under heavy
fire by the allied forces.

147
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,220
在这片群岛触礁搁浅
And it ran aground in
this chain of islands.

148
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,610
多亏了你 
我们现在能确定就是在这座岛屿
Thanks to you... We now
know it's this island.

149
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:21,820
是你杀了我的朋友们
You killed my friends.

150
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:27,340
也就是说只能靠你...
来帮我们找到那艘潜艇
Which means it's up to you...
To help us find that sub.

151
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:51,810
你是不是忘了点什么
Are you forgetting something?

152
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,810
你们这是要去哪里
Where do you think you're going?

153
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,080
塔希提岛
Tahiti.

154
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,210
有意思
That's funny.

155
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,890
飞行记录显示你们要去莫斯科
The flight manifest says
you're going to Moscow.

156
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,530
我们会顺路在那儿停一下
你懂的 在去塔希提岛后
Well,we're going to stop by
there, you know,after Tahiti.

157
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:15,090
什么样的合伙人会背着其他人去
我们的海外公司访问呢
What kind of partner decides to interact with
our overseas holdings behind the other one's back?

158
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,670
是我疏忽了
It was an oversight.

159
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,960
幸运的是 我这个合伙人收拾行李很快
Well,lucky for our
partnership, I'm a fast packer.

160
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,020
Oliver 她一路跟着可没什么好处
Oliver,her tagging along
does not help matters any.

161
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:28,540
我会看好她的
I will take care of her.

162
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:30,250
John
John.

163
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,780
我们会把Lyla带回来的
We're going to bring Lyla back.

164
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,310
不论她在哪儿
Wherever she is.

165
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,110
明天上午十点我安排了一个
I've arranged a meeting with
the chief operating officer

166
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,650
与莫斯科子公司运营总裁的会议
of our Moscow subsidiary
tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.

167
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,740
可别又错过了
Try your hardest not to miss this one.

168
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:02,920
我不是你想的那种人
You know,I'm not this person
that you seem to think I am.

169
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,250
- 那得看情况
- 什么情况
- That depends.
- On what?

170
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:08,160
比如当我发现你用集团的飞机跟
你的助手出去欢度周末的时候
On if I think you use the corporate jet
for a weekend of fun with your assistant.

171
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,580
你在说什么
Excuse me?

172
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,060
一个金发IT美女
A blonde I.T.girl all of a sudden

173
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,170
突然被提拔成CEO的助理
gets promoted to be
assistant to the C.E.O.?

174
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,660
只有两种可能
There are only two ways that happens.

175
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,700
一种情况是她是你的亲戚
但她明显不是
One is nepotism, and she
doesn't look like your cousin.

176
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,230
真的不是你想的那样
That...is... absolutely not happening.

177
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,600
那她到底有什么资历
What were her qualifications?

178
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,320
除了她那一条又一条的超短裙
Aside from an abundance of short skirts.

179
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,300
她的裙子也没那么 短
Her skirts aren't that...short.

180
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,680
你们说什么呢
What was that about?

181
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:30,630
没什么
Nothing.

182
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,890
Knyazev那边已经安排好了
Everything with Knyazev is set.

183
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,240
你还有俄罗斯黑手党的朋友

184
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,970
就当我一点都不惊讶好了
Color me at not at all surprised.

185
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,470
你直接打车去酒店吧
You're going straight
to the hotel in a cab.

186
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:37,620
不 你要抛下我一个人 跟她一起走吗
No,you're leaving me with her?

187
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,060
Dig和我得去喝一杯
Dig and I need to get a drink.

188
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,310
我不介意也喝一点儿啊
Well...I...wouldn't mind a drink.

189
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:48,950
Loring女士
Ms.Loring.

190
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,930
没想到你是会来夜店的人
Didn't take you for
the club-hopping type.

191
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,730
我来办正事
Well,I'm here on business.

192
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:54,150
我妈妈没事吧
Is everything ok with my mom?

193
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:56,350
正好 我们得谈谈这事
We need to discuss
something about this case.

194
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,850
你男朋友昨晚被警方拘捕了
Your boyfriend Roy was
arrested last night.

195
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,070
我知道 这事有点误会
I know,but it was actually
a misunderstanding.

196
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,230
他已经被释放了
He got released.

197
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,250
但是有些狗仔抓住你母亲不放
Well,a few reporters
got hold of the story

198
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,270
现在 你跟小混混交往的事
已经变成了他们的口舌
and they now know you're
dating a known felon.

199
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,720
Thea 你母亲的案子生死攸关
Thea,your mother is
on trial for her life.

200
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,620
她所有的辩护都建立在
Her whole defense pivots on
being seen as a loving mother

201
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,730
全心全意为你们俩考虑的基础上
who did what she had to
do to protect her children,

202
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,170
因为她是一位伟大的母亲
what kind of parent she was.

203
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:19,260
我们希望其他人看到的是两个
家教良好 正直的孩子
We need the people to know that she
raised you to make good decisions.

204
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:23,980
如果你还顾念你的母亲
就该立刻和对方分手
So if you care about your mom, you're going
to have to end this relationship immediately.

205
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,590

209
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,910

感谢你抽空见我们
Thank you for meeting us.

If Oliver vouches for you, you're
my second favorite American.

212

现在可以谈正事了
Now.Business.

217
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,950
这个女的就是你要找的人吧
This is woman you look for,yes?

218
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:29,090
这相片是两天前在古拉格监狱拍下的
Picture is from two days
ago,from gulag-- prison.

219
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,400
Lyla被抓了
Lyla was arrested?

220
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,590
不尽然
Not quite.

221
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:34,390
据我所知 她是试图闯进监狱
From what I hear,she
was trying to break in.

222
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,620
为什么
Why?

223
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,360
我不知道
I do not know.

224
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,340
可惜她出不来了
But clearly she had
issues breaking back out.

225
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,860
古拉格 俄国最恐怖的监狱
Gulag,worst in Russia.

226
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,820
被称为Koshmar
It's called Koshmar.

227
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:47,880
噩梦
The nightmare.

228
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,880
里面有各种各样心理变态的暴力分子
还有杀人犯
It's full of violent
psychopaths and killers.

229
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,230
这些还都只是看守
And that's just the guards.

230
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,950
Anatoly 我们得进去把她救出来
Anatoly,we need a way into
the gulag to extract her.

231
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,580
还没等你出来 就挨枪子了
You get in,you get
shot before you get out.

232
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,900
或者干脆出不来了
Or end up like your friend.

233
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:03,790
你救不了她
Mmm,it's impossible.

234
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:06,790
不把她救出来 我绝不会离开俄罗斯
The only thing that's impossible is us
leaving this country without this woman.

235
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,440
挺对我胃口
I like this guy.

236
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,630
在俄罗斯 没有"乐观"这个词
We have no word for
"optimist" in Russian.

237
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:20,540
想进古拉格
唯一的办法就是成为那里的犯人
The only way in to
Koshmar is as prisoner.

238
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,390
里面有个看守欠我个人情
Now,I have guard there,owes me favor.

239
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,740
我们可以找他
It could work.

240
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,470
但是你只有5%的可能会成功
I'll give you one shot in twenty.

241
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,970
- 你安排吧 我进去
- 不
- Set it up.I'll go.
- No.

242
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:33,510
- 让我去
- 不
- It has to be me.
- No.

243
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,230
Oliver 你不能有事
Oliver,what if something
happens to you in there?

244
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:38,590
如果是我 Felicity 或者Isabel出事
What happens to me,Felicity,or
Isabel,for that matter?

245
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,820
你还可以在外面接应我们
You have to be on the
outside making the moves.

246
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:45,730
让我去 我没问题的
I'll go inside.I've got this.

247
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,440
带的有点多啊
Now that is a lot of drugs.

248
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,740
是Knyazev友情赞助的
Courtesy of Knyazev.

249
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:05,770
足够让我蹲古拉格了
About enough weight to
land me in the Koshmar.

250
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:10,980
你得穿上这个
You need to be wearing
this when they process you.

251
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,940
好让看守把它没收
Guards will take
it,but that's the point.

252
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:19,730
这位 就是Knyazev在监狱里的朋友
This... Is Knyazev's
man inside the prison.

253
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:21,430
那个看守
A guard.

254
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,490
他知道Lyla关在哪里
He'll know where in the
gulag Lyla is being held.

255
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,950
得手之后 你和Lyla
得去约定的地方找我们 否则...
When all hell breaks loose, you need to meet
us at the rendezvous point with Lyla,or...

256
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:31,210
我就得永远留在俄国了
Or I am a permanent Russian.

257
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:39,340
我多嘴一句...
这就是我们的最佳方案了
Just thinking out loud... But,are we sure
this is the best plan we can come up with?

258
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:43,230
- 我知道Lyla是你的朋友 但是...
- Felicity Lyla不是我的朋友
I know Lyla's your friend,but...
Felicity,Lyla isn't my friend.

259
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,340
她是我的前妻
She was my wife.

260
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,470
能解释一下吗
Explain that sentence.

261
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,510
Lyla和我在阿富汗军中相识
Lyla and I met in the
army back in Afghanistan.

262
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,390
但是回国后 
我们的婚姻并没能维系下去
But we didn't stay married
long once we got stateside.

263
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:01,600
想来是因为没仗可打了
也就不会过日子了
Couldn't figure out a way to stay
married without a war to fight.

264
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,430
后来她加入了警卫队
So she joined A.R.G.U.S.

265
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,700
而我第三次踏上了征途
and I circled back for my third tour.

266
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,810
我一定要带她回去 Felicity
I can't leave here without her,Felicity.

267
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:13,990
一定
Just can't.

268
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:19,770
还有两分钟
Two minute warning.

269
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,240
祝你好运 John
Good luck,John.

270
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:10,980
他进去了
They have him.

271
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,630
行动开始
Clock's running.

272
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:33,970
Zhivey zhivey
Zhivey,zhivey.

273
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,070
快点
Hurry up.

274
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,540
外套不错
Khoroshaya kurtka.

275
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:22,150
你犯了什么事
What,uh,crime fits your punishment?

276
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,290
毒品 你呢?
Drugs.And you?

277
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,550
我发表了公开演说
I gave speech.

278
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:27,750
揭露政府的腐败行为
About government corruption.

279
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:28,960
不意外
Right.

280
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:34,870
我们这像你这样的人可不多
It is rare to see one of
your people in Koshmar.

281
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:35,980
什么人 美国人
What,American?

282
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:37,300
黑人
Chernokozhiy.

283
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,990
黑人在这不太受欢迎
Ehh... Chernokozhiy not popular here.

284
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,700
好怕怕呀
Shocker.

285
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:54,590
Dig不会有事的吧
You think Dig's ok?

286
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,560
我想他跟五分钟前你问我时一样没问题
I think he's doing the same as he was
when you asked me five minutes ago.

287
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,460
他们来了
They're coming.

288
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:03,060
就是他们把俄国警车便宜卖给我们
They sell us Russian
police truck for cheap.

289
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,100
这是你要的东西
Vot mashina,kotoraya vam nuzhna.

290
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,670
这是一百五十万
Sto pyatisot tysyach rubley.

291
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:29,960
跪下
Na koleni.

292
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:48,350
不给我就杀了你全家
Yesli vy sde syete eto, moi lyudi
vas, I vashi deti osanutsya sirotami.

293
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,500
你跟他说了什么
What'd you say?

294
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,770
求他
Please.

295
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,520
知道吗 在俄国有个集中营
You know,in Russia,there is gulag.

296
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:15,740
几乎跟这儿一样糟
Almost as bad as this.

297
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,130
- Sara 
- 别叫名字
Sara-- Don't
say my name.

298
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:29,920
被他们发现我们认识 我们都会被杀的
If they find out we know each
other,they'll kill us both.

299
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,570
我以为你淹死了
I thought you drowned.

300
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,680
当我醒来时 船已经不见了
When I came up,the boat was gone.

301
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:42,240
我以为你也淹死了
And I thought you were,too.

302
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:48,120
我在海上漂了几天后
这艘船...他们发现了我
And I was floating out there for
days when this ship... They found me.

303
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,230
然后救了我
And they saved me.

304
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,320
所以你帮他们做事
Is that why you're helping them?

305
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:54,140
我别无选择
I don't have a choice.

306
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,260
我得去警告我的朋友们
I need to warn my friends.

307
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,100
你不是说他们死了
You said they were dead.

308
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,570
他们可没那么容易就死了
They're not that easy to kill.

309
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:14,380
别乱动
Try not to move.

310
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:19,610
这东西闻着真恶心
It smells like puke!

311
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,330
这对伤口有好处
It'll heal your wounds.

312
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:24,570
你必须走
You have to go.

313
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,400
离开这儿
Get out of here.

314
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,450
去高点的地方
Get to higher ground.

315
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:30,190
我不会离开你的
I'm not leaving you.

316
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:36,280
我不能拖累你
I will not be the reason
something happens to you.

317
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,920
那就没什么问题了
Then we're in agreement.

318
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,760
这是我自己的选择
Because I make my own choices.

319
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,740
你是个坚强的女人
You are a strong woman.

320
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:47,220
我会为我关心的人做任何事
When I care about someone,there's
nothing I won't do for them.

321
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:52,800
我们又有个...共同点了
Another thing... we have in common.

322
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,920
烧伤降低了你的体温
The burns,they're lowering
your body temperature.

323
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:03,480
过来
Here.

324
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,110
你整晚都去哪儿了
Where you been all night?

325
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,390
干活
Working.

326
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,890
你该好好歇歇
Well,you deserve a break.

327
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:20,550
其实 我想了想
Um,actually,I've been thinking.

328
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,260
或许我们该给彼此多点空间
Maybe we should take some space.

329
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:26,230
我是说我们朝夕相处
I mean,we work together
and live together.

330
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,600
都快窒息了
It's kind of getting hard to breathe.

331
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,450
什么时候开始这么觉得的
Since when?

332
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,980
等等 这跟那个蹦出来的女律师有关系吗
Oh,wait,does this have to with
that lawyer lady dropping by?

333
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,390
不 这跟你上个月
No,this has to do with the fact

334
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,440
被逮捕的就有两次有关
that you've been arrested
twice in the last month.

335
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,260
别这样 我已经尽量避免惹麻烦了
Come on. I've been trying
to stay out of trouble.

336
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:41,450
这几周我连个擦伤都没有
My body hasn't had a
scratch on it in weeks.

337
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,470
我是说除了你抓的那几道
Well,I mean,excluding the
ones that you put there.

338
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:45,470
那天晚上呢
And the other night?

339
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,060
那是个误会
Was a misunderstanding.

340
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:54,100
Roy...我做不来
Roy... This just isn't working,ok?

341
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:55,990
实在办不到
Not for me.

342
00:22:58,330 --> 00:22:59,270
Thea 你不是那个意思对吗
Thea,you can't mean that.

343
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:03,090
我就是那个意思 对不起
I do. I'm sorry.

344
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:39,200
那些人... 他们很好斗
Those men... They are Vory.

345
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:40,950
而且很有势力
They are in charge.

346
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,810
最好离他们远点
It's best to stay away.

347
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,190
Got it.

348
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:50,520
Listen,I'm looking for a
guard named Sergei Pavelski.

349
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
在那边角落那儿

350
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,190
了解

351
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:50,520
我在找一个叫Sergei Pavelski的看守

352
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,370
美国佬... 现在起你是我的玩物
American... You are suka now.

353
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,720
真的要这么做吗
Are we seriously going to do this?

354
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:08,510
我想是的
Guess so.

355
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:23,840
严禁打架
Fighting strictly prohibited.

356
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:33,710
请给我杯伏特加
Vodki,pozhaluysta.

357
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,390
你错过演出了
You missed the tour.

358
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:39,090
发生了什么事
What happened to you?

359
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:43,160
我看到了一辆我以前有过的俄国车
I saw a Russian vehicle
that I simply had to have.

360
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,600
这是你来俄国的目的吗
Is that why you came to Russia?

361
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:45,700
买车
Car shopping?

362
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:47,560
我只点了一杯
Oh,I just ordered one.

363
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,700
这杯是我的 再来一杯
One's for me.

364
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,590
这是个冷藏室
This cold room.

365
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,340
你要在这儿待6个小时
Six hours for you.

366
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,880
6个小时 你不能关我这么久
Six hours? You can't
keep me in here that long.

367
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:13,260
那就7小时
Now seven hours.

368
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:24,840
你那么做太傻了...而且
Well,that was pretty
stupid... Then again,

369
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:28,260
你确实也不是什么聪明人
you never really were
one of the brightest guys.

370
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,550
死亡射手
Deadshot.

371
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,670
你脊柱冻透了没
Your spine frozen through yet?

372
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,460
相信我
Trust me.

373
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,420
这点冷才不是我现在的最大问题
My problem here isn't with the cold.

374
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,380
什么 你还没原谅我杀了你哥哥吗
What,you still haven't forgiven
me for shooting your brother?

375
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:49,510
伙计 你还真记仇
Man,you really hold a grudge.

376
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,220
我知道你来这儿干嘛
I know why you're here.

377
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:54,890
那个女孩
That girl.

378
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:56,850
来自警卫队的
From A.R.G.U.S.

379
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,790
看来Lyla不止找到了关于你的线索
Lyla didn't find a lead on you.

380
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:02,880
而且找到了你
She found you.

381
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,500
- 大家真的认为我跟Felicity是...
- 没有
- Does everyone really think that Felicity and I are...
- No.

382
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:10,670
只是在Queen集团工作的人都这么认为
Just everyone who works
at Queen Consolidated.

383
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,280
我跟她只是朋友
She's just a friend.

384
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,360
你看着不像有女性朋友的人
You don't seem like the kind
of man who has female friends.

385
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,090
我能问你个私人问题吗
Can I ask you a personal question?

386
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:22,080
喝了几杯伏特加 我或许会回答吧
With some vodka in
me,I just might answer.

387
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:27,760
为什么救我家族的公司对你那么重要
Why does saving my family's
company mean so much to you?

388
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:32,400
女强人Sheryl Sandberg不会那么说的...
Despite what Sheryl
Sandberg might say...

389
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,880
但女人在商场打拼还是不容易
It still isn't that easy to
make it as a woman in business.

390
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,910
我...放弃了很多东西
I've...given up a lot.

391
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:44,040
如果我不能成功 那有何意义
Which means if I don't succeed at
everything, then what was the point?

392
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,510
我能问你一个私人问题吗
May I ask you a personal question?

393
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,660
其他人问过 但问了也白问
Others have tried and failed.

394
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:53,950
你为何这么想
让我认为你是个懒惰的白痴
Why do you try so hard to make
me think that you're a lazy idiot?

395
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:55,400
我知道你不是
I know you're not.

396
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:59,400
在你的伪装下 我能清楚地看到
Underneath that swagger,I
see you pretty clearly.

397
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:00,440
是吗
Really?

398
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:03,350
你看到什么了
And what do you see?

399
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,920
你很聪明
You're intelligent.

400
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:07,850
有紧迫感
Driven.

401
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:11,430
还很孤独
And lonely.

402
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:14,340
你怎么看出来的
How do you see that?

403
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:17,850
因为我也是那样的人
Because it's what I see
when I look in the mirror.

404
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,990
我们时间不多了
We don't have much time.

405
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,010
- 走吧
- 走 走了
- There you go.
- Let's go,let's go.

406
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:38,740
很高兴见到你 John
Nice seeing you,John.

407
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,680
请问还需要点别的吗
Can ***

408
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:44,100
我想不该再喝了
I ***

409
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:46,430
你会说俄语
You speak Russian.

410
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:48,000
只跟我朋友说
ONLY ***

411
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:50,290
直到九岁前 我都生长在莫斯科
I was raised in Moscow until I was nine.

412
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,680
然后一个家庭把我收养到美国
And then adopted by a family
that took me to America.

413
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,970
我花了几年时间才改掉口音
Took me years to get rid of my accent.

414
00:27:56,870 --> 00:28:00,620
俄国口音在小学交朋友可不容易
It isn't easy making friends in grade
school when you sound like Natasha.

415
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:09,310
听起来你长久以来都很孤独
Sou ***

416
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,500
买单吧
Pay ***

417
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,570
我...没有太多时间
I...Don't have a lot of time.

418
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:20,340
我会很快的
I'll be quick.

419
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:22,690
五分钟 必须快点
Five minutes.Must hurry.

420
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,560
等这事搞定了 记得提醒我给你买包烟
Remind me to get you a pack of
cigarettes when this is all over.

421
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,400
我不抽烟的
I don't smoke.

422
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:38,510
你不会不带上我走吧
You weren't going to
leave without me,were you?

423
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:40,200
我真该马上杀了你
I should kill you right now!

424
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,510
你不会的
You won't.

425
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:44,250
为什么
Why?

426
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:48,370
因为只有我知道你女朋友关在哪里
BecauseI'm the only one who knows
where your little girlfriend is.

427
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:51,270
你可不傻
You're not stupid.

428
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:53,990
你没有逃离计划怎么会被关进来
You wouldn't put yourself in
here without an exit strategy.

429
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:57,880
我带你去找她...你带我出去
I take you to the
girl... You take me out.

430
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,330
Isabel 我得走了
Isabel,I have to go.

431
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:06,860
抱歉
Sorry.

432
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:09,640
我像是那种矫情的人吗
Do I strike you as someone
who needs to cuddle?

433
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:19,130
时候到了 准备好了吗
- Hi. - Hi. -
It's time.Ready?

434
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,900
- 是的 我...
- 我想她今晚可以休息了 
Yeah,I-- I think she
can take the night off.

435
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:23,200
是吗
Don't you?

436
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:31,420
- Felicity...
- 发生在俄国的事过了就过了
Felicity... It--what happens
in Russia stays in Russia.

437
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,530
尽管没什么意义
Even when it makes no sense whatsoever.

438
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:54,270
我看 枪还是你拿好了
Guessin',uh,you want to hold on to that.

439
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:56,260
这边
This way.

440
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:00,850
你在想什么啊
What were you thinking?

441
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:01,800
什么
What?

442
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:05,000
俄国有超过六千四百万
到了法定年龄的女人
你却跟她上床
Over 64 million women over the age of
consent in Russia and you sleep with her.

443
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:11,840
不是说"发生在俄国的事过去就过去了"吗
So we're not doing the "What
happens in Russia stays in Russia?

444
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,070
我们还在俄国
" We're still in Russia.

445
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,490
在这个国家没有钱是办不到的事
There is nothing money
cannot buy in this country.

446
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,390
Diggle两分钟内会带Lyla出来
Diggle should be heading
out Lyla in two minutes.

447
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,220
越狱可不容易
Well,breaking out of prison
is harder than it looks.

448
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:28,380
你们应该都知道吧
You of all people should know that.

449
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,300
别出声 跟我来
Stay quiet. Follow me.

450
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,500
你会记得我们的吧...是吗
You'll remember the rest of us... Yes?

451
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:00,950
我保证
I promise.

452
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,410
我会回来的
I'll come back.

453
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:07,850
快走
Come on.

454
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,430
- 我们要游过去吗
- 不
- Are we making a swim for it?
- No.

455
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,210
我们一下水他们就会开枪的
They'd shoot us the
second we hit the water.

456
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,870
你说你朋友 他们有一台船用收音机 对吗
You said your friends,they have one
of the radios from the ship,right?

457
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:26,630
是的
Yeah.

458
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,120
看来你很会用嘛
You look like you know
what you're doing there.

459
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,850
过去几年 我学了许多意想不到的东西
In the past year,I've learned a
lot of things I never expected to.

460
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:34,150
我们都是
You and me both.

461
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:40,990
他们没听到你的声音是不会回应的
They won't respond unless
they hear your voice.

462
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,420
Shado
Shado.

463
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:54,640
你能听到我吗
ni neng ting dao wo ma

464
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:00,770
Slade
Slade.

465
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:03,150
你能听到我吗
Can you hear me?

466
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:08,020
谢天谢地 你还活着
Thank God you're alive.

467
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:13,400
- 是的 我在货船上...
- Sara 你在干嘛
Yeah,I'm on the freighter--
Sara,what are you doing?

468
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:14,780
他们只有两个人
There's only two of them.

469
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:18,150
他们还没离开迫击炮的攻击范围
They haven't moved from the
location of the mortar attack.

470
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:20,830
这到底是怎么回事
What the hell is going on here?

471
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:23,210
你刚确认你的朋友还活着
You just confirmed that
your friends are alive.

472
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,750
这意味着他们还是个威胁
Which means they're still a threat.

473
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,510
在我们杀掉他们之前
You know,until we kill them.

474
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:29,180
你个狗娘养的
You son of
a bitch--oh!

475
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:46,390
如果我说她在里面 
你要怎样才不会朝我开枪
If I say she's in there, what's
keeping you from shooting me?

476
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:49,530
信誉
Honor.

477
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:53,170
你也该试一试讲信誉
You should try it some time.

478
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,310
Lyla
Lyla!

479
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:03,250
Johnny
Johnny?

480
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:04,940
准备回家吧
Ready to go home?

481
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,480
你来救我了
You came for me.

482
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,970
我一直会 以后也会
I always have. Always will.

483
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,070
死亡射手在这呢
Deadshot's here.

484
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,460
- 就在这监狱里
- 我知道
- In the prison.
- I know.

485
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,760
你打算怎么逃出去
What's your extraction plan?

486
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:19,910
随机应变吧
Depends.

487
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,350
现在几点
What time is it?

488
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:27,360
我穿着帅吧
YOU ***

489
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:36,630
走 我们走 快 快
Let's go,go,go,move,move,move!

490
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,440
这边
This way.

491
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:57,270
搞定 我切断了通信
Got it. I shut down the phones.

492
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,450
狱警们没法呼救了
The guards can't call for help.

493
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,700
你朋友和那女的到现在还没出现
他们出不来了
Your friend and that woman are not here
by now, they will not be here at all.

494
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:10,270
这下好多了
Much better.

495
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:12,800
都给我趴下
on***

496
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,690
Oliver 蹲下
Oliver,get down!

497
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:34,460
跟我来
Follow me!

498
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:35,640
快
Move!

499
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,610
我们逃出来了
We're clear.

500
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,600
停车
Stop the truck.

501
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:03,150
下车 快下车
Get out. Get out!

502
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:09,180
快点
Move.

503
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,600
这是信誉问题 John
That's the thing about honor,John.

504
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,130
你不会出尔反尔的
You can't turn it on and off.

505
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:40,030
我只是好奇
I'm just curious.

506
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:43,580
你知道你哥怎么死的吗
How is it you think your
brother ended up dead?

507
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:48,810
你要杀一个Andy保护的客户
结果你失手了
You shot a client that Andy
was protecting, and you missed.

508
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,260
我从未失手
I don't miss.

509
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,160
你哥才是目标人物
Your brother was the contract.

510
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:58,060
谁想杀Andy
Who would want to kill Andy?

511
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:00,990
不清楚 只知道一个化名
I don't know the names,just an alias.

512
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,080
Hive
Hive.

513
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,960
好好想吧 John
Food for thought,John.

514
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:12,130
够你想想的
Food for thought.

515
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,180
我们不聊聊昨晚的事吗
Are we going to discuss
what happened last night?

516
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:46,770
为什么呢
Why would we?

517
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:49,150
不为什么
No reason.

518
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,120
明天公司见
I'll see you in the office tomorrow.

519
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,050
多谢
Thank you.

520
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:09,070
你那么支持我
You had my back.

521
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,170
所以现在你知道那是什么感觉了吧
And now you know what it feels like.

522
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:23,150
你在这干什么
Wh--what are you--
what are you doing here?

523
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:25,280
问得好
Good question.

524
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:27,350
我接过很多从监狱打来的电话
I've gotten a lot of calls from prison,

525
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,030
但还没接到过我女友老妈打来的
but never from my girlfriend's mother.

526
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:30,040
我突然想起来
It occurred to me

527
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:33,710
我一直没机会认识你生命中最重要的男人
that I've never been given the
opportunity to meet the man in your life.

528
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,620
我不知道你女儿是否说过
她把我甩了
I don't know if she told you, but
your daughter kind of dumped me.

529
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,830
你要知道她是因为我才这样做的
And what you should know
is that she did it for me.

530
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:42,790
Jean跟我讲她找过你
Jean told me she came to see you.

531
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,370
我告诉她不该那么做
I told her she shouldn't have.

532
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,460
你为什么不跟我说实话呢
Why didn't you just tell me the truth?

533
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:51,890
咱们在一起 会对妈的案子不利
Us being together...
It can hurt her case.

534
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:58,370
Thea 你的社交生活
并不是影响我审判结果的决定因素
Thea... Your social life is not going
to be the determining factor in my trial.

535
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:00,960
乖女儿 你去年所经历的事情
Sweetheart,what you've had
to endure this last year

536
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,620
比多数人两辈子经历的还多
is more than most people
go through in two lifetimes.

537
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,170
但你不仅挺过来了 还有所成长
But you've not only
survived,you've flourished.

538
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:10,250
我想这跟Roy有很大关系
I think a lot of that
has to do with Roy.

539
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:14,240
所以作为你的母亲 我不允许你们分手
So,as your mother,I
forbid you not to see him.

540
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,130
谢谢
Thank you.

541
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:28,070
我不得不承认
这次俄国之行的结果不是我所预料的
I have to admit, this is not how I
anticipated my trip to Russia ending.

542
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:30,830
我只是庆幸我们能活着离开那里
I just feel lucky we made
it out of there alive.

543
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:33,830
谢谢你
Thank you.

544
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,770
不仅因为你来救我
Not just for coming for me.

545
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:38,550
还有你当时的选择
For doing what you had to once you did.

546
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,060
你是说跟死亡射手的合作么
You mean working with Deadshot.

547
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,330
你知道么 我跟Carly分手
是因为我不能在爱她的同时
You know,me and Carly broke
up because I couldn't love her

548
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,400
又恨着他
and hate him at the same time.

549
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,150
很荣幸我是个例外
I'm honored to be the exception.

550
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,850
Lyla 你永远是个例外
Lyla,you're always the exception.

551
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:10,090
不 不 让Waller去做吧
No,no,let Waller stew.

552
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:13,040
你留下吃早餐
Stay for breakfast.

553
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:15,790
除非你做拿手的蓝莓饼
Throw in your blueberry pancakes

554
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:17,260
我可能会考虑留下来
and you may be able to convince me.

555
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,490
帮忙把这个送到Isabel的办公室
Can you deliver this to
Isabel's office,please?

556
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:54,730
为什么选择她
Why her?

557
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:00,750
我是说 除了她有长腿模特的身材
I mean,besides the...
obvious leggy model reason.

558
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:02,700
顺其自然而已
It just kind of happened.

559
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,270
并不代表什么
It didn't mean anything.

560
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:13,470
因为我的生活
Because of the life that I lead...

561
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:18,340
我觉得最好还是不要...
I just think that it's better to not...

562
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,790
和我真正在乎的人在一起
Be with someone that I
could really care about.

563
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:44,470
好吧 我觉得你值得比她更好的人
Well,I think... I think
you deserve better than her.

564
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:54,400
找到他们的位置了
We have their location.

565
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,730
他对我们而言不再有用了
This one's no longer of use to us.

566
00:40:57,370 --> 00:41:02,030
让我们看看你能有多大本事
可以取出你脑袋里的子弹
Let's see how good you are... At
removing a bullet from your head.

567
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,150
等等
Wait!

568
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,230
他或许还有用处
He could still be useful.

569
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:09,990
她说得对
She's right.

570
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:15,100
一旦我们干掉他那俩朋友
我们还需要他带我们去到那个墓穴
Once we get rid of his friends, we'll
need him to lead us to the graves.

571
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:21,800
有时候我在想这里谁是老大
Sometimes I wonder who
gives the orders here.

572
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:25,090
是你... 还是你的小跟班
You... or your little bouzin.

573
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,980
你又要回岛上了
You're going back to the island.

574
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,490
Oliver
Oliver.

575
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:49,750
