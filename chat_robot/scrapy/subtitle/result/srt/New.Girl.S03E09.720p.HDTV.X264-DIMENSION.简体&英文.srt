1
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:04,420
我在考虑今晚的约会
Oh, hey. I was wondering about date night tonight.

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:06,200
你想不想就在家呆着呢
Um, do you want to just stay in?

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,600
你明白我的意思吧
'Cause you know what that means.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,680
-浪漫晚餐  然后看国土安全  -滚床单
- Romantic dinner and Homeland? - Sex on the couch.

5
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,970
-你的想法更好  -其实看国土安全也不错
- Or your thing. - Actually, Homeland sounds great.

6
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:12,760
还是你的想法更好
Or your thing.

7
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,340
尼克
Hey, Nick, um...

8
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,770
我昨晚跟弗格森洗澡的时候
Last night when Furguson and I were in the shower,

9
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:17,930
我恍然大悟了
I had an epiphany.

10
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:19,170
是时候回到现实了
It's time to get back in the game.

11
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,170
我该去见见女人
You know, meet some women.

12
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,070
人类的女人
Human women.

13
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,990
-人类  还有其他类的女人么  -女人
- Human? Is there any other kind? - Human.

14
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,160
我想今晚你能不能帮我照看弗格森
Anyway, I was wondering if you'd watch Furguson tonight

15
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,020
我想出去跟工作伙伴们喝几杯
while I go out for some drinks with some work buddies.

16
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,250
就一会就好  你记得6点给他吃药就行
Just for a little while. You just gotta give him a pill at 6:00.

17
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,900
-我们今晚要约会  -杰茜
- We're having date night tonight. - Jess...

18
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,200
温斯顿要出去见女人了
Winston wants to go out to meet human women.

19
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,520
还不带猫
Without the cat.

20
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,290
哦  这样哦
Oh, yep, yep.

21
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:42,240
好的  好的  尼克会照看你的猫
Yep, yep. Nick will watch the cat.

22
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,600
有个问题  喂药是从嘴喂还是从屁屁喂
Question, are those mouth pills or butt pills?

23
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,870
就一片药
Just one pill.

24
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,380
从屁屁喂
Just one butt pill.

25
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,510
-给你  -不用了  我不想碰它
- Here you are. - Nah, I'm not touching that thing.

26
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:50,680
不想  好吧
No? Okay.

27
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:53,330
-谢了  哥们  -客气
- Thanks, man. - Yeah. You got it.

28
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,180
你们今晚就在家了吗
Hey, guys. Just hanging at home tonight?

29
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,680
不啊  我们要约会
No, actually, we have a date tonight.

30
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,250
我刚做了酥皮水果馅饼
'Cause I just made some cobbler.

31
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,200
桃子馅的
Some peach cobbler

32
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,740
我还弄了香草冰淇淋
and slow-churned vanilla bean ice cream,

33
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,660
今晚教练要约会希希
and Coach is asking Cece out on a date tonight, and...

34
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,780
谁想来一口吗
does anybody want a bite of this, 'cause it's...?

35
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:09,980
刚出锅的哦
It's fresh out of the oven.

36
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:11,830
烫爆了
It's piping hot!

37
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,900
但愿教练提前跟你打招呼了
Well, I hope Coach at least ran this by you first.

38
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,780
教练来找我了  很讲义气
Coach came over, he followed the bro code.

39
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,260
我们聊得挺好的
Actually went really well.

40
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,670
我正要找你呢
Yeah. Just the man I wanted to see.

41
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,090
-那正好  -是啊
- You found me. -Yeah, I did.

42
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,320
亲  我有个问题问你
I got a question for you, playa.

43
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,760
放马过来吧
Drop the bomb, man!

44
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,910
我能约希希去约会吗
Can I ask Cece out on a date?

45
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:40,120
好啊  等等  你说什么
Yeah! Wait, what?

46
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,800
对希希是大好事啊  教练那么帅
Wait, that's so great for Cece. Coach is super hot.

47
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,830
最佳损友
Wrong crowd.

48
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:47,940
我看出来了
I see that now.

49
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,310
尽管如此  你已经跟希希吹了
Be that as it may, you blew it with Cece,

50
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,510
你应该不介意这事儿吧
so you have to be fine with this.

51
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,040
-我可以啊  -真的吗
- I am. - You are?

52
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,890
-我绝对没问题  -是吗
- I promise I am. - You are?

53
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,670
-我百分之百没事  -你没事吗
- 100% fine. - You're fine?

54
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,720
-我完全没事的  -真的么
- Yeah, I'm absolutely fine. -Really?

55
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,170
这对希希好  对教练也好  皆大欢喜啊
It's good for Cece, it's good for Coach, it's good for America.

56
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,540
可能又弄出一个泰格伍兹呢
Who knows? We might even get another Tiger Woods out of this situation.

57
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,740
那多好啊
Wouldn't that be nice?

58
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,140
我可能就是想多了
I'm probably getting ahead of myself.

59
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,520
希希还不一定答应呢
Who knows if Cece will even say yes?

60
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,820
她答应了
She said yes!

61
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:12,460
我们今晚要去斯台普斯中心看球
We're going to the Staples Center to watch a game tonight.

62
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,520
你确定你没事吗
Are you still... Are you cool with this?

63
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,650
只要你说出那个词
I mean, 'cause all you have to do is say the word, man,

64
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,360
我一定收手
and I'll back off, for real.

65
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,920
不啊
N... No, man.

66
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,860
加油  就约她
Come on. Date that thing.

67
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,820
-好啊  -多约几次
- Yeah! All right! -Yeah! And then date it again.

68
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,830
-可不光是约个会  -约个一整晚哦
- It's not gonna date itself. - Yeah, date it all night long.

69
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,260
我有点紧张了
I'm kind of nervous!

70
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:33,960
没错  我紧张了
Yeah, I'm nervous.

71
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,490
我非常紧张
Yeah, I'm really nervous. Um...

72
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,740
她那么美  又超级酷
I mean, she's beautiful and she's super cool.

73
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,350
你简直无法想象
And it's just, like... Like, you don't even know.

74
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:41,390
-我百分百知道  -没错  你知道
- I 100% know. - Yes, you kno... You know.

75
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,870
因为我  她都悔婚了
She stopped the wedding because of me, so I'm just saying.

76
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,540
然后我却辜负了她  因为我自己的原因
And then I ruined it 'cause I had my own thing.

77
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,070
玛丽亚跟我分手
Malia broke up with me and that kind of,

78
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,110
弄得我可不淡定了
like, threw my head for a loop,

79
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,650
-所以我现在可脆弱了  -别  别担心
- so I'm super vulnerable right now. - Oh, wait. Don't-don't worry.

80
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:50,700
就好像  我也不知道
It's like... I don't know.

81
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,920
我觉得特没安全感
Think I'm feeling kind of insecure.

82
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,970
别这样  你可是教练啊
Come on. You're Coach.

83
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,760
-你是独一无二的教练  -没错
- You're the Coach. - Yeah.

84
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,790
你可是一流的  记住  你是一流的
You're the prize. Remember, you're the prize.

85
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:00,490
你是一流的
You're the prize.

86
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:01,180
我可是教练
I'm Coach!

87
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,250
没错  你可是教练
Yeah, you're Coach.

88
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,160
-那她可是手到擒来  -好吧
- She doesn't stand a chance! - Oh, yeah, well...

89
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,490
我要好好调教调教她
She's gonna get it good!

90
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,010
你其实可以不那么操之过急的
Yeah! Or you could take it slow!

91
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,310
-不  我要提枪上阵  -你要提枪上阵
- Nah, I'm gunning it! - Oh, oh! Y-You're gonna gun it.

92
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,740
-我要提枪上战场  -你来真的吗
- I am gunning it. Yes. - You're gonna gun it for real?

93
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,180
头等舱的屁股今晚要坐在教练牌椅子上
That first-class ass is sitting in Coach tonight.

94
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:18,350
收起小桌板  哥要带她起飞啦
And best believe, my seat will be in an upright and locked position.

95
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,020
谢了  施密特
Thanks, Schmidt.

96
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:25,260
弟兄们
Oh... boy.

97
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,400
他要提枪上阵了
He's gonna gun it.

98
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,360
不知道你们听到没
I don't know if you heard that,

99
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,900
但他说他要提枪上阵了
but he said he's going to gun it.

100
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,750
-他真的不像没事  -在他说
- He's really not fine. - When he says,

101
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,850
"我没事"的时候  他一定会有事的
"I'm fine," He's about to get un-fine.

102
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:40,400
施密特
Aw, Schmidters.

103
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:44,970
一定会有别的开放表演场有更坚固的凳子
There's gonna be other open mics with sturdier stools.

104
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,480
我没事
I'm fine.

105
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,780
我知道你没事
I know you're fine.

106
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,380
到时候他们就能见识到你的说唱水准
Then they'll see your rap skills. Then...

107
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,330
住手  你刚刚说你没事的
Hey. Stop! You just said you were fine!

108
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,110
你刚刚说你没事的
You just said you were fine!

109
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,200
让我死吧
Let me die!

110
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:57,480
我了解施密特
I know Schmidt.

111
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,230
他会全力去破坏那场约会的
He's gonna try and stop that date from happening.

112
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:03,130
-好吧  -所以只能把他控制住
- Okay. - So the strategy is containment.

113
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:04,510
-好吧  -我们得把他锁起来
- Okay. - Okay? We got to lock him up.

114
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,180
像对婴儿一样分散他的注意力
Distract him like a baby.

115
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,880
要是他不乖  我们就动用武力
If he gets out of line, we got to get physical.

116
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,310
我们要对婴儿动武吗
We're gonna get physical with a baby?

117
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,050
别质疑我  我可是专业的
Please don't question me. I'm a pro.

118
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,060
或者我们可以帮他走出来
Or we could help him move on.

119
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,260
带他出去  让他喝醉  没准能遇上新欢呢
Take him out, get him drunk, maybe meet someone new?

120
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,020
不  我们得把他关在安全的地方
No. We just got to keep him in a safe place.

121
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,910
真希望我弄到了那狗笼
I wish I had that dog cage.

122
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,210
-搞没搞错  -看到有狗笼卖你就买一个
- What? - When you see a dog cage for sale, you buy it.

123
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:24,270
杰茜  今晚又泡汤了  真的很对不起
Hey, Jess, about tonight, I'm so sorry.

124
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:24,950
没事的没事的
Yeah. No, it's okay.

125
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,610
要约会的话可以等我嫁...
We'll have date night when we're marrie...

126
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,800
-个乌哎  乖乖隆个咚  -你刚刚是说
- da, burp a durp a durp. - What did you just...

127
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,500
假日  等到圣诞假日的时候
Merry. When we're very merry Christmas.

128
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,790
算了不管了
All right, moving on.

129
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,830
我仔细想了想教练和希希
I'm having second thoughts about Coach and Cece.

130
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,250
也许我该阻止他们约会
Maybe I should stop their date.

131
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,930
变聪明了
Smarten up!

132
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,190
谢谢你
Thank you. Um...

133
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:46,480
你弄到那个狗笼了吗
did you get a chance to get that, uh... the dog cage?

I... He asked me out on a date, and I said yes.

138
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,320
反正我们俩都刚刚分手
We're both going through a breakup right now,

139
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,870

Yeah. Yeah.

154
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,860
我去拿包
I'm gonna go get my purse.

155
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,090

Look at you!

156
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,770
你是最棒的  你是最棒的
You're the prize! You're the prize!

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,730
你好吗
Hey. What's up, man?

159
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,190
咋样  咋样  咋样
That's what's up, that's what's up, that's what's up.

160
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,200
真的很谢谢你们陪我
Really appreciate this, guys.

161
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:54,860
你们饿了吗
Are you guys hungry?

162
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,900
-一直很饿  -没错
- Always. - Yeah.

163
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,530
太好了  我去斯台普斯中心买点吃的
Great. I'm gonna go get some food from the Staples Center.

164
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,530
位于洛杉矶中心城区的多功能体育中心

165
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:59,550
放松  冷静点
Hey, easy. Chill out.

166
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,030
你是对的  你是对的  明智的决定
You're right, you're right. Great call.

167
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,150
你好  温斯顿
Hey, Winston.

168
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,900
你怎么啦
Hey. What happened to you?

169
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,000
我以为你去派对了
I thought you were supposed to go to a party.

170
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,640
是啊  时间久得
Yeah, it's been so long

171
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,840
我都忘了该如何与女士聊天了
that I think I forgot how to talk to women.

172
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:11,560
你从未好奇过这里是否有人杀过人吗
You ever wonder if someone in here has killed someone?

173
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,540
弗格森是他的名字  没错  他是我的猫
Furguson is his name. Yeah, he's my cat.

174
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,940
你看他戴着牛仔帽
Here's him in a cowboy hat.

175
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,420
天呐  亲爱的  你的脚是有多大啊
Good Lord, darling, how big are your feet?

176
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,310
你知道吗  没关系
You know what? It's fine.

177
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,630
我可以独自过一生
I'll be alone my whole life.

178
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:25,000
汉克・阿伦每次全垒打时也是一个人
You know, Hank Aaron was alone for every home run he hit.

179
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,600
只要还有弗格森陪着我
As long as I got Furguson.

180
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,490
说到这  我的猫呢
Speaking of which, where is that cat?

181
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,650
弗格森
Furguson!

182
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,280
这就奇怪了  我一叫他就会过来的
That's strange. He usually comes when I call him.

183
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,010
尼克  你是不是忘了关窗户
Nick, you left the window open?

184
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,320
天呐  这下完了
Oh, my God. No.

185
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,360
-尼克  -什么事
- Nick! - What?

186
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,360
他一直想要踢开窗户去抓鸽子的
You know he always trying to kick it with those pigeons.

187
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,480
尼克  是你放跑他的
Nick, you let him out.

188
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,100
我不是有意的  只是不小心打开了窗户
I did... I didn't mean to. I just opened the window.

189
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,430
兄弟  我就拜托你一件事
Man, I asked you to do one thing!

190
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,560
-温斯顿  我很抱歉  -这是你的错
- Winston, I'm really sorry. - This is your fault, man!

191
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,780
我很内疚  温斯顿
I feel terrible, Winston.

192
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,780
你得帮我找回他
You're gonna help me find him!

193
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,850
温斯顿  别走啊  温斯顿...
Winston, don't leave... Winston...

194
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:51,930
好吧  我来了  兄弟
Okay, I'm coming, buddy.

195
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:53,440
杰茜  不好意思  你得
Jess, I'm sorry, but you're gonna

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,200
-留下来看着施密特  -不
- have to stay here and keep an eye on Schmidt. - No.

197
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,530
你不能留我跟他单独在一起
You can't leave me here with him.

198
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:58,060
没错  她说得对
No, she's right.

199
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,740
你可不能这么做  万一我失控了呢
You can't do that. What if it gets rough?

200
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,190
尼克  我能感觉到他正在水深火热之中
Nick, he is in pain. I can feel it.

201
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,140
-你走试试看  -留下来
- Don't you go! - Stay!

202
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,310
我好怕怕  哥们
I am so scared, man!

203
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,580
那你想要我怎么做  杰茜
What do you want me to do, Jess?

204
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,320
-留下  -你敢走试试看  -别吵啦
- Stay. - Don't you dare go. - Everybody settle!

205
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,900
这是我的错  温斯顿  我跟你一起去
Look, this is my fault. Winston, I'm coming with you.

206
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,340
好的
Okay.

207
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,040
施密特  振作起来吧
Schmidt, just get it together.

208
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,730
杰茜  我很抱歉  你在这看好他
Jess, I'm sorry. Just keep him here

209
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:14,960
将他的注意力从约会上移开  我得走了
and keep his mind off the date. I got to go.

210
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,190
抱歉啊
I'm sorry.

211
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,020
我们走
We got to go.

212
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,720
去找那只该死的猫吧
Let's find that damn cat!

213
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,410
你觉得教练和希希现在正在做什么
What do you think Coach and Cece are doing right now?

214
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,600
-我可不知道  -他们可能已经坐下来
- I don't know. - They probably just sat down.

215
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,480
第一次互相摸大腿了
Touching thighs for the first time.

216
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,880
-我要去阻止他们的约会  -不
- I'm gonna go stop that date! - No!

217
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,340
你就这么一点点本事吗
Is that literally all you have?

218
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,790
天呐  我们完蛋了
Oh, my God, we're screwed.

219
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,140
-尼克  -尼克
- Nick! - Nick!

220
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:45,630
想想看
Uh, think.

221
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,090
教练给我留了破绽
Coach gave me an out.

222
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:49,500
他说  "只要你说出那个词  我就收手"
He said, "Just say the word and it's off."

223
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,110
不管了  我要去说出那个词
And you know what? I'm just gonna say the word.

224
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,620
不要  别这样
No! No!

225
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,520
你去打电话  你去跟他说
You call, you say the word.

226
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,830
不  施密特
No, Schmidt!

227
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,720
天呐  你不能这样对希希
God, you can't do that to Cece.

228
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,460
她刚跨过你这道坎
She's just starting to move on.

229
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:00,270
我们只要熬过今晚就好了
All we have to do is get through the night.

230
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:00,950
只要熬过今晚就好
Just get through the night.

231
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,310
你只要不去想她就好
Just have to get your mind off her.

232
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,780
你想先做什么
What do you want to start with?

233
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,590
Play it now

234
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:08,210
Play it now, my baby

235
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:10,750

What's- what's happening?

237
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:17,610
也许你不该穿鞋子跳  我也不知道
Maybe just go no shoes. I don't know.

238
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,920
这是十年级的时候  所以
Okay, and this one's tenth grade, so...

239
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,050
这个是伊万・G写的
This one's from Evan G.

240
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,930
伊万・G是水球队的队长
Evan G. Was the captain of the water polo team.

241
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,320
"你好呀杰茜  我们都喜欢午餐"
"Hey, Jess, we both like lunch."

242
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,590
这倒是事实
That's true.

243
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,290
靠过来一点  兄弟
Oh, lean in... aw, dude...

244
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:32,260
Play it now, play it now

245
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,550
My baby

246
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:36,010
Cracklin' Rosie, get on board

247
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:40,340
《律师本色》剧情

248
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,180
卡穆琳・曼海姆给一个被狂欢节小丑骚扰的女人
Camryn Manheim represents a woman who was heckled

249
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,340
做代表  然后迪伦・麦克德莫特说...
by a carnival clown, and Dylan McDermott says...

250
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,140
-我没法不想希希  -行
- I can't stop thinking about Cece! - Okay!

251
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,900
尼克还说这有用呢  坐下
Nick said this would work. Sit down.

252
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,660
-别想希希了  -我坐下了
- Stop thinking about Cece. - I'm gonna sit down.

253
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,070
你看这皮革
Look at this leather.

254
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,580
它是褐色的  这么的光滑
It's so smooth, brown.

255
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,840
就像希希一样
It's just like Cece.

256
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,340
这样说真奇怪
That's weird.

257
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,240
你说得对  我该躺一会儿
You're right. I'm just gonna lay down for a little bit.

不行  我得把你弄出去
No! We're getting you out of here,

266
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,940

尼克说了要待在家里

Well, Nick doesn't know everything, Schmidt.

269
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,420
别这样了  这太恶心人了
And please stop this. This is so disgusting.

270
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,530
我都没法直视你了
I can't even look at you.

271
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,390
这太恶心了  你这样很奇怪
Come on, this is gross. This is getting really weird.

272
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,460
拜托  让我再亲一口
Please! Just one more kiss!

273
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,980
你亲的是家具  蠢货
No, you're kissing a sectional, you dummy!

274
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,100
好吧
All right.

275
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,730
这样是对的  你做得对
That was the right move. You did good.

276
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,490
弗格森  弗格森
Furguson! Furguson!

277
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:42,490
弗格森
Furguson!

278
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:43,310
快回来  兄弟
Come here, buddy!

279
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:44,920
快来啊  你这个小坏蛋
Come on, you little son of a bitch!

280
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,420
我们应该再围着公园转一圈
We should do another lap around the park.

281
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,930
我猜现在那些玩飞碟的小破孩应该走了
I bet those mean-ass kids playing Frisbee are gone by now.

282
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,990
温斯顿  我们所有地方都找过了
Winston... we've looked everywhere.

283
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,670
你要干...  温斯顿
What are you do...? Winston.

284
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:54,910
该死
Damn it!

285
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:57,970
我真不该去那个派对的
I should've never gone to that party.

286
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,780
不  派对是个好东西
Nah, the party was a good thing.

287
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,610
-你应该多参加点派对  -真的吗
- You should go to more parties. - Really?

288
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,310
我被  我也不知道
I got shot down by, I don't know,

289
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,970
16个女人拒绝了
16 or so different women.

290
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,330
然后我回家来却发现
And then I come home to find out

291
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,900
你弄丢了我最好的朋友
that you have misplaced my best friend.

292
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,770
-弗格森变成你最好的朋友了  -对
- Furguson's your best friend now? - Yes!

293
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,040
你知道自己在说什么吗
Would you listen to yourself?

294
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,510
太可悲了
This is pathetic.

295
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:15,000
"可悲"有点太严重了
"Pathetic" is harsh.

296
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,570
我不是...
I didn't mean...

297
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,910
朋友才不会说朋友可悲呢
Friends don't call friends pathetic.

298
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,000
如果朋友和猫洗澡
Well, what do friends do

299
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,010
他的朋友该说什么呢
when their other friend is taking a shower with a cat?

300
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,650
等等  等等
Wait, wait, wait!

301
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,860
我收到一条短信
I just got a text.

302
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,800
有人找到他了
Somebody found him.

303
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,370
真的吗
No way!

304
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,420
-对  -弗格森
- Yes. - Furguson?

305
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,350
对  别拍手
Yes! Don't do that at all.

306
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,040
如果猫还活着  我们就和解了
If that cat's alive, we're made up.

307
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,370

想吃咸味脆饼吧
You want a pretzel?

312
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,160
不用了  这样很好  谢谢
No, I'm-I'm fine, thanks.

313
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,150
刚才不是提问  帅哥
It wasn't a question. Hey, yo, slice!

314
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:50,150
给我来七个热乎的
Let me get about seven of them hot things!

315
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:51,690
你怕我没钱吗
You worried about the money?

316
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,240
没问题  我有钱  宝贝
It's cool, I got it, babe.

317
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,130
教练今年收成好
Coach had a good year today.

318
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,390
好吧  我同意跟你约会的时候
Yeah, when I-I agreed to go out with you,

319
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,180
可没想到这种事
this isn't exactly what I expected.

320
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,680
我知道  大家都这么说  大家都这么说
I know, I hear that a lot, I hear that a lot.

321
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,700
看这个
Ha-ha! Look at that.

322
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,260
教练收到好多短信啊
Coach is blowing up.

323

我没法跟这些人渣瞎混

曾经沧海难为水

329
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,650
你要向前看  原来那个施密特哪去了
You are moving on. Now, where's the old Schmidt?

330
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:27,600
我刚搬来的时候  你可是来者不拒的
When I moved into the loft, you used to pull so many ladies.

331
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,830
你从前就是个传奇
You were legendary.

332

她还在用翻盖手机  杰茜
She's on a flip phone, Jess.

336
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,770
她要么很穷  要么就是穿越了
I mean, she's either poor or a time traveler.

337
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,210
你好  这是我的朋友施密特
Hi! This is my friend Schmidt.

338
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,390
他又可爱又聪明
And he's sweet and he's smart.

339
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:47,010
他的工作我不太懂
And he has a job that I don't really understand,

340
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,150
但是薪水应该很高
but seems to pay him well.

341
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,550
-施密特  坐下  -好

Now, do you see that bug-eyed woman over there?

350

我得把她甩开
I need to ditch her

351
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,840
这样我才能实现自己的命运
so that I can go fulfill my destiny.

352
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,470
她看别处的时候跟我说一声
Now, tell me when she looks away.

353
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,300
正在看我们
Not now.

354
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,240
还不行  稍等
Not now. Wait.

355
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,300
就现在
Now.

356
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,370
只可惜相遇太晚
What might've been.

357
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,640
施密特  站住
Hey, Schmidt! No!

358
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:31,810
你猜他会变成什么样
What do you think he's gonna look like?

359

我也不知道  我只想带他回去
I don't know, I wanna get him back.

他俩心有灵犀

366
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:49,230
我懂  我自己也养了一头野兽

我在努力辨别它的气味
Trying to just figure out the smell, I guess.

373

这家伙最听话了

我宁愿和他一起在家看实习医生格蕾

我也对女人没兴趣了

381

太可惜了

390
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,110
她这么说是好事还是坏事

Do you have anything that says "I'm sorry for cheating on you.

407
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,600
请不要和我朋友上床"的品种
Please don't sleep with my friend"?

408
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,360
当然没有  很好
Of course you don't. Wonderful.

409
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,890
看这些试吃品
Ooh, look at that-- samples.

410
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,730
你和谁短信呢
Wha...? Who are you texting right now?

411
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:29,320
你说什么呢
Uh, wh-what are you talking about?

412
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,640
我没在发短信  我只是...
I'm not texting. I was just, uh...

413
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,020
你此时此刻就在发短信
You're texting right now.

414
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:32,770
不  我只是...
Nah, I'm just, uh...

415
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:34,700
无论你在和谁发
Okay, you know what? Whoever you are texting,

416
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,730
如果你想和他们一起的话
if you want to be with them,

417
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:37,780
你应该走开去和他们一起
you should just go off and be with them.

418
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:39,530
你真爱吃醋
You're so jealous.

419
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,870
好吧  老娘够了
Okay, yeah, you know what-- that's it!

420
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,810
老娘不伺候了
That is the last straw!

421
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,950
拜拜您那
I'm out of here.

422
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,290
希希...
Cece...

423
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,970
伯蒂  你一直是巴士司机吗
So, Bertie, have you always been a bus driver?

424
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,400
我之前管理一家鞋店
I used to manage a shoe store.

425
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,980
后来  我辞职了
Then I, uh, quit,

426
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:04,430
有过几年黑暗的生活
had a few dark years.

427
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:07,350
-卖过一阵基督徒的T恤  -好吧
- Sold Christian T-shirts for a while. - Okay.

428
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,660
我把输卵管结扎了  可不便宜
Got my tubes tied. Not cheap.

429
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,240
-这谈话真透明  -闭嘴  尼克
- This is a real honest conversation. - Shut up, Nick.

430
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,810
重新振作起来  焕然一新
Pulled myself out of that personal hell, and... voila.

431
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,630
-哇  -我喜欢
- Wow. - You know,

432
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,210
驾驶巴士
I like driving a bus.

433
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,430
可以在仪表盘上放我喜欢的东西
Get to put whatever I want on the dash.

434
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:22,210
驱走黑暗
Keeps the darkness away.

435
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:23,120
你明白吗
You know?

436
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,060
我还...
I also, uh...

437
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:26,780
我在画画
I paint.

438
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,080
你喜欢画画
You paint?

439
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,600
那是艘船
It's a boat.

440
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,650
我能看出来那是条船
Oh, I can see it's a boat.

441
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,270
好吧
All right, well, uh...

442
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:41,200
我最好把胃药吃了
I better take my stomach medicine.

443
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,800
我三点半就得起床
I got to get up at 3:30.

444
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,850
-早上吗  -我是开公交车的
- Is that a.m.? - I drive a bus.

445
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,900
你就不能闭嘴吃你的破三明治吗  尼克
Will you eat your damn sandwich, Nick.

446
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,420
我不爱吃这个
I don't like it.

447
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,210
你呢  温斯顿  你喜欢吃吗
What about you, Winston? Do you like it?

448
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:52,900
我不会对你撒谎的  伯蒂
I'm not gonna lie to you, Bertie.

449
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,990
有的地方确实硬得咬不动
Sometimes it was a little hard to chew.

450
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:57,990
你可以吸一吸让它变软点
Well... you can suck on it to make it soft.

451
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:06,520
你们俩是擦出火花了吗
Wow. Is something happening between you two?

452
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:09,610
-伙计  她太真实了  -很好
- Dude, she is so real. - Okay, good.

453
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,700
你能帮我一把吗  你知道你欠我的
Would you do me a favor? Now, you owe me.

454
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:14,250
温斯顿  我乐意之极  任你差遣
Winston, I would love to. Anything.

455
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,390
说真的  任你差遣

456
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:17,020
-那好  -我欠你的
- Okay. - I owe you.

457
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,500
我需要你...
I need you...

458
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,550
今晚帮我把弗格森带回家
...to take Furguson home tonight for me

459
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,610
而我就留在这了
while I just stay here and,

460
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,850
你懂的  碰碰运气
you know, see where this goes.

461
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,670
没问题  这可是重要的一刻
Yes. This is a big moment.

462
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,690
-是啊  -我为你骄傲
- Yeah. - I'm proud of you.

463
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:31,890
听着  弗格森  我要做成年人该做的事了
Listen, Furguson, I'm about to do what adults do.

464
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,040
-祝我好运吧  -别叽歪了
- Hey, wish me luck. - I think that's enough.

465
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,130
-祝我好运  -这只猫可太肥了
- Wish me luck. - Oh, this is a fat cat.

466
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:36,100
这决定有点唐突  要不我...
It's a tough decision. Do I...?

467
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:36,650
我还是走吧
I'll just leave...

468
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,160
-呆着吧  你给我呆着  -好的
- Stay here, stay here. - Okay. Yeah!

469
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,620
希希  等等  请等一下
Cece, wait! Please wait!

470
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,200
我是在和我妈妈发短信
I was texting my mom!

471
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,580
-蠢货  -闭嘴
- Dork. - Shut up!

472
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,970
拜托了
Oh, come on!

473
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:50,530
你真觉得我会相信你
Do you really expect me to believe that?

474
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:52,790
不  我保证...  我  我妈妈
No. I-I promise... I... My mom--

475
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,610
她和我发短信是因为我...
she was texting me because I was...

476
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:57,310
因为我太紧张这次约会了
I was super nervous about this date.

477

479
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,150
那个指的是我  我是宝宝
That's me. I'm Booboo.

480
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,220
为什么你跟我说话
Why do you need inspirational quotes

481
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,430
还需要你妈妈的励志名言
from your mom just to talk to me?

482
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,850
对不起  我...
I'm sorry. I...

483
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:11,790
我只是  我刚从一段恋情中走出来
I'm just... I'm coming out of this relationship,

484
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:15,610
然后有点...  我只是...
and, like... I just...

485
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,720
我不知道  我觉得我不知道怎么...
I don't know. I feel I don't know how to...

486
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,410
我不知道该怎么从头再来了
I don't know how to do this anymore.

487
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,950
我明白你的感觉
I know how you feel.

488
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,040
你明白
You do?

489
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:25,940
是的
Yeah.

490
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:30,720
现在我就想给咱俩买几杯酒喝
I just want to buy us some drinking

491
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,870
然后开始对你上下其手  妹子
and get up on you, girl.

492
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:32,930
你看  你又开始胡言乱语了
You see, you're doing it again.

493
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:34,310
见鬼  我知道
Damn it! I know.

494
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:35,660
对不起
Sorry.

495
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,640
斯密特
Hey! Schmidt!

496
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:39,940
斯密特  你在干什么
Schmidt, what are you doing?!

497
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,450
你拿着那么多巧克力干吗
Why do you have all that chocolate?

498
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:43,120
我要去把她赢回来
I'm going to go win her back!

499
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:45,010
你知道我在哪能买到漂亮的蜡烛吗
Do you know where I can get a pretty candle?!

500
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,030
别这样  斯密特  到车上来
No. Come on, Schmidt, get in the car.

501
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,450
上车吧
Get in the car.

502
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:52,990
我爱她  杰茜
I love her, Jess.

503
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,430
我必须要告诉她
I have to tell her.

504
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,800
你不能
Well, you can't.

505
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,680
你必须放她走
You have to let her go.

506
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,670
我知道
I know.

507
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,080
你说的对  我知道
Look, you're right. I know.

508
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,620
那很好  来吧  上车吧
Okay, good. Come on, get back in the car.

509
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,120
我还知道用不了30秒
I also know that in about 30 seconds,

510
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,190
我会再次从你眼前逃跑
I'm gonna run away from you again,

511
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,750
而且这一次  我会甩掉你
and this time, I will lose you.

512
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,160
我会顺着小巷子  穿过公园
I'll go down alleys, I'll cut across parks.

513
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:15,610
我会在各种影子里  潜行  躲藏
I will live in the shadows, just slithering, lurking,

514
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:17,320
穿梭于黑暗之中
trolling the darkness.

515
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,410
杰茜  你只有一种办法阻止我
Jess, there's only one way for you to stop me.

516
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,410
无论是什么  我都会做
Well, I'll do it, whatever it is.

517
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,370
开你的车撞我
Hit me with your car.

518
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:27,960
什么  不  不
What?! No! No!

519
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:29,690
那是你阻止我的唯一办法
It's the only way for you to stop me!

520
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:31,800
不  那太疯狂了  施密特
No! That's crazy, Schmidt!

521
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,950
快  杰茜  就现在  我是活该
Come on, Jess. Now, do it! I deserve it.

522
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,120
我背叛了你最好的朋友
I cheated on your best friend,

523
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,840
我试图让你和尼克分开
I tried to break up you and Nick.

524
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,540
-踩油门  -不
- Hit the gas. - No! No!

525
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:41,260
杰茜  要么你这么做  要么我就跑了
Jess, you do this, or I'm gonna run.

526
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,620
-我不想这么做  -我数三下
- I don't want to! - I'm gonna give you to the count of three.

527
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,120
-不  我不想  施密特 -三
- No, I don't want to! Schmidt! - Three.

528
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,310
二  为了希希
Two. Do it for Cece.

529
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,130
我的上帝
Oh, my God!

530
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,900
那算什么意思
What the hell was that?!

531
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,880
你让我开车撞你
You told me to hit you with the car!

532
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,370
-你个该死的竟然开车撞我  -你让我撞的
- You friggin' just hit me with your vehicle! - You asked me to.

533
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,930
我没想到你真的会那么干
I didn't think you were really gonna do it.

534
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:02,920
我就是轻轻碰了你一下
I barely tapped you.

535
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,350
这是我最喜欢的卡其布休闲裤
This is my favorite utility khaki!

536
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,190
那就别在你不想让我开车撞你的时候
Well, then don't tell me to hit you with my car

537
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:08,050
跟我说让我开车撞你
if you don't want me to hit you with my car!

538
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:10,120
-你已经失控了  -什么
- You're out of control! - What?

539
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,610
女士  请停到路边
Ma'am, please pull over.

540
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:12,590
杰茜
Jess!

541
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,570
我的上帝
