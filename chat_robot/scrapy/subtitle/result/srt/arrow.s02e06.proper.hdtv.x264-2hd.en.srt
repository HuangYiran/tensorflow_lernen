1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,640
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:05,430
After five years on a hellish island,

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,980
I have come home with only
one goal-- to save my city.

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:15,080
But to do so,I can't be
the killer I once was.

5
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:20,450
To honor my friend's memory,
I must be someone else.

6
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,220
I must be something else.

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,920
Previously on "Arrow"... As much as
I would love to make this city safer,

8
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:34,570
my first obligation is to Queen
Consolidated and yours is,too.

9
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,040
I did some reading up on Lawton.

10
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,240
Lyla,listen-- Did you really think I
wouldn't find out that he killed your brother?

11
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:40,630
That you were using me?

12
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:42,550
I need to see this guy in a bag.

13
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:43,780
You,of all people,should get that.

14
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:49,080
Long time particularly for
Bratva captain.Mr.Queen.

15
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,800
Anatoly Knyazev, he speaks
very highly of you.He should.

16
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,050
I saved his life.

17
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,100
You were supposed to sign this
report at last night's board meeting.

18
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:13,940
You know why you didn't?

19
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,170
Probably because I didn't attend
last night's board meeting.

20
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:17,900
Where were you?

21
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,980
I have other interests
outside of this company.

22
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,190
I don't.

23
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,830
Mr.Queen-- I thought you were serious
when you said we were partners.

24
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,390
Isabel,I missed one meeting.

25
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,490
This week.Last week,it was two meetings.

26
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:30,460
Mr.Queen.

27
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:34,380
Companywide revenue is at double
digits since you and I took over.

28
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,910
- Oliver!
- Yes?

29
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:39,360
I'm sorry to interrupt your... Grr!

30
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:43,070
Um,I need to talk to you about
your plans for this evening.

31
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:44,920
With Mr.Harper?

32
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,080
You'll have to excuse me.

33
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,630
We have work to do.It's important.

34
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:55,030
So are my evening plans.

35
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,390
I'm sorry.

36
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,180
We are going to have
to work on your excuses.

37
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,060
You're right.

38
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,100
You should be more careful.

39
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,260
You're completely exposed.

40
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,030
I knew you were there.

41
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:28,380
What,you wanted me to tell you when the
funny money guys were ready to make a sale?

42
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,320
Here we go.

43
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,490
Not "we." Go home.

44
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:33,820
I already have help.

45
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:37,870
Here's the fake.

46
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,710
Let's see the real.

47
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,750
You got two right above you.

48
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:13,400
Another at your six.

49
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,480
Stay where you are,don't move!

50
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,850
I want to make a citizen's arrest.

51
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:26,740
Don't move.

52
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,150
That's it.I'm clear.

53
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,790
Task force X to Mockingbird.

54
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,510
We have the prize,we're coming home.

58
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,080
Who are you people?

59
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,720
NSA?CIA?

60
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,140
My name is Amanda Waller.

61
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,020
I thought you A.R.G.U.S.guys
were supposed to be more subtle.

62
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,480
For us,this was subtle.

63
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:17,630
Then I want to see Lyla Michaels.

64
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,360
So do I.

65
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,870
Agent Michaels has gone dark.

66
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,050
Lyla's missing?

67
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:23,990
What happened?

68
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,730
She was running down a lead in Moscow.

69
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,180
She's missed two of
her scheduled call-ins.

70
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,370
Well,what are you doing about it?

71
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,290
Speaking to you.

72
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,140
Even if we knew where in Russia Lyla is,

73
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,320
my superiors believe
sending in an extraction team

74
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,760
could cause an international incident.

75
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,990
As far as they're concerned, she's
already a framed picture on our lobby wall.

76
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,250
Why are you telling me all this?

77
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:53,520
Because I know how you and
Oliver Queen spend your nights.

78
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,040
And I know your passport is up to date.

79
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,740
It would help to start with what Lyla
was doing in Moscow in the first place.

80
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,820
What was this lead
she was tracking down?

81
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,780
A line on the whereabouts
of Floyd Lawton.

82
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,520
Deadshot.

83
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,150
Lyla was in Russia for me,

84
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:16,670
Agent Michaels is an asset
I can't easily replace.

85
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,070
I know you find her
similarly irreplaceable.

86
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,610
Bring her home,Mr.Diggle.

87
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:37,920
Thanks.

88
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,680
It's been a while since I arrested you.

89
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,710
I'd forgotten how good it feels.

90
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,630
I was working for...him.

91
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,180
Him who?

92
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,280
The guy who cost you your shield.

93
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,360
I'm on his team.

94
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,430
You are,too.

95
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,550
Anybody else having serious deja vu?

96
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:01,660
That's all right,we're letting him go.

97
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,020
Our mistake.

98
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,590
He was just in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

99
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:17,270
Ok,uh,let's just get out of here
before anyone changes their mind.

100
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:27,240
The potentially catastrophic
risk of turning on this machine

101
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,360
far outweigh any scientific
gain that might come from it.

102
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,360
The people need to understand just
how dangerous technology like this is.

103
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:38,160
And the very real possibility
of a cataclysmic event.

104
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,840
Where'd you go?

105
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:44,190
Is everything ok?

106
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:45,810
Yeah.

107
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,780
Just need a few personal days.

108
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,850
What's going on?

109
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,040
Have to help a friend.

110
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,800
Who?

111
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,660
Lyla Michaels.

112
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,820
It's his spy girlfriend
that works for A.R.G.U.S.

113
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,520
She went to Russia looking
for Deadshot, for me.

114
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,420
Now she's missing.

115
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:09,260
Felicity... I think it's time we visited
our Queen Consolidated subsidiary in Moscow.

116
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:10,710
Yeah.

117
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,010
Oliver,what are you doing?

118
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,910
Just need to help a friend.

119
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,020
I can't ask you to do that.

120
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,150
You didn't.

121
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,280
Sara... My name's Ivo.

122
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,750
What's your name?

123
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:39,480
Tommy.

124
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:40,850
So.

125
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,780
How did you come to be
on this island,Tommy?

126
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:45,440
I assume it wasn't by choice.

127
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,430
My,uh... Boat was shipwrecked here.

128
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,300
And I was the only survivor.

129
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,140
Well,I'm sorry to hear that.

130
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,400
Did you explore the island much?

131
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,250
Some of it.

132
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:05,380
Why?

133
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:10,150
You didn't happen to run across a
Japanese Imperial Navy submarine,did you?

134
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:19,060
During World War II, every country was
trying to develop the ultimate weapon.

135
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:23,400
The United States had the
Manhattan Project,of course;

136
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,540
the Nazis had das Uranverein.

137
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:30,420
And the Japanese,well,
they had Mirakuru.

138
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:33,280
Stem cell and genetic therapies,
decades ahead of their time.

139
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,350
Every war advances the cause of science.

140
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:45,110
And the Japanese,they had developed a
serum that caused increased strength.

141
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,240
Rapid cell regeneration.

142
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,360
They called it Mirakuru.

143
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,740
"Miracle.

144
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:55,410
" Thought they could create
an army of super soldiers.

145
00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:00,640
They were transporting their
only supply via submarine

146
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,870
when that sub came under heavy
fire by the allied forces.

147
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,220
And it ran aground in
this chain of islands.

148
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,610
Thanks to you... We now
know it's this island.

149
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:21,820
You killed my friends.

150
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:27,340
Which means it's up to you...
To help us find that sub.

151
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:51,810
Are you forgetting something?

152
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,810
Where do you think you're going?

153
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,080
Tahiti.

154
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,210
That's funny.

155
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,890
The flight manifest says
you're going to Moscow.

156
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,530
Well,we're going to stop by
there, you know,after Tahiti.

157
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:15,090
What kind of partner decides to interact with
our overseas holdings behind the other one's back?

158
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,670
It was an oversight.

159
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,960
Well,lucky for our
partnership, I'm a fast packer.

160
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,020
Oliver,her tagging along
does not help matters any.

161
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:28,540
I will take care of her.

162
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:30,250
John.

163
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,780
We're going to bring Lyla back.

164
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,310
Wherever she is.

165
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,110
I've arranged a meeting with
the chief operating officer

166
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,650
of our Moscow subsidiary
tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.

167
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,740
Try your hardest not to miss this one.

168
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:02,920
You know,I'm not this person
that you seem to think I am.

169
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,250
- That depends.
- On what?

170
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:08,160
On if I think you use the corporate jet
for a weekend of fun with your assistant.

171
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,580
Excuse me?

172
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,060
A blonde I.T.girl all of a sudden

173
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,170
gets promoted to be
assistant to the C.E.O.?

174
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,660
There are only two ways that happens.

175
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,700
One is nepotism, and she
doesn't look like your cousin.

176
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,230
That...is... absolutely not happening.

177
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,600
What were her qualifications?

178
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,320
Aside from an abundance of short skirts.

179
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,300
Her skirts aren't that...short.

180
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,680
What was that about?

181
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:30,630
Nothing.

182
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,890
Everything with Knyazev is set.

183
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,240
You have friends in the Russian mafia?

184
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,970
Color me at not at all surprised.

185
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,470
You're going straight
to the hotel in a cab.

186
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:37,620
No,you're leaving me with her?

187
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,060
Dig and I need to get a drink.

188
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,310
Well...I...wouldn't mind a drink.

189
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:48,950
Ms.Loring.

190
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,930
Didn't take you for
the club-hopping type.

191
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,730
Well,I'm here on business.

192
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:54,150
Is everything ok with my mom?

193
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:56,350
We need to discuss
something about this case.

194
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,850
Your boyfriend Roy was
arrested last night.

195
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,070
I know,but it was actually
a misunderstanding.

196
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,230
He got released.

197
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,250
Well,a few reporters
got hold of the story

198
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,270
and they now know you're
dating a known felon.

199
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,720
Thea,your mother is
on trial for her life.

200
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,620
Her whole defense pivots on
being seen as a loving mother

201
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,730
who did what she had to
do to protect her children,

202
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,170
what kind of parent she was.

203
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:19,260
We need the people to know that she
raised you to make good decisions.

204
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:23,980
So if you care about your mom, you're going
to have to end this relationship immediately.

205
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,590
Oliver Queen?

206
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,070
My favorite American!

207
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:47,690
Dabro pazhalavat.

208
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:48,760
It has been too long.

209
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,910
John Diggle,this is Anatoly Knyazev.

210
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,590
Thank you for meeting us.

211
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,660
If Oliver vouches for you, you're
my second favorite American.

212
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:01,950
First,a toast.

213
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,990
None for me,thanks.

214
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,800
Prochnost.

215
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,120
To strength.

216
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,130
Now.Business.

217
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,950
This is woman you look for,yes?

218
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:29,090
Picture is from two days
ago,from gulag-- prison.

219
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,400
Lyla was arrested?

220
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,590
Not quite.

221
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:34,390
From what I hear,she
was trying to break in.

222
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,620
Why?

223
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,360
I do not know.

224
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,340
But clearly she had
issues breaking back out.

225
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,860
Gulag,worst in Russia.

226
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,820
It's called Koshmar.

227
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:47,880
The nightmare.

228
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,880
It's full of violent
psychopaths and killers.

229
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,230
And that's just the guards.

230
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,950
Anatoly,we need a way into
the gulag to extract her.

231
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,580
You get in,you get
shot before you get out.

232
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,900
Or end up like your friend.

233
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:03,790
Mmm,it's impossible.

234
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:06,790
The only thing that's impossible is us
leaving this country without this woman.

235
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,440
I like this guy.

236
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,630
We have no word for
"optimist" in Russian.

237
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:20,540
The only way in to
Koshmar is as prisoner.

238
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,390
Now,I have guard there,owes me favor.

239
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,740
It could work.

240
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,470
I'll give you one shot in twenty.

241
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,970
- Set it up.I'll go.
- No.

242
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:33,510
- It has to be me.
- No.

243
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,230
Oliver,what if something
happens to you in there?

244
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:38,590
What happens to me,Felicity,or
Isabel,for that matter?

245
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,820
You have to be on the
outside making the moves.

246
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:45,730
I'll go inside.I've got this.

247
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,440
Now that is a lot of drugs.

248
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,740
Courtesy of Knyazev.

249
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:05,770
About enough weight to
land me in the Koshmar.

250
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:10,980
You need to be wearing
this when they process you.

251
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,940
Guards will take
it,but that's the point.

252
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:19,730
This... Is Knyazev's
man inside the prison.

253
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:21,430
A guard.

254
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,490
He'll know where in the
gulag Lyla is being held.

255
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,950
When all hell breaks loose, you need to meet
us at the rendezvous point with Lyla,or...

256
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:31,210
Or I am a permanent Russian.

257
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:39,340
Just thinking out loud... But,are we sure
this is the best plan we can come up with?

258
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:43,230
I know Lyla's your friend,but...
Felicity,Lyla isn't my friend.

259
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,340
She was my wife.

260
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,470
Explain that sentence.

261
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,510
Lyla and I met in the
army back in Afghanistan.

262
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,390
But we didn't stay married
long once we got stateside.

263
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:01,600
Couldn't figure out a way to stay
married without a war to fight.

264
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,430
So she joined A.R.G.U.S.

265
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,700
and I circled back for my third tour.

266
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,810
I can't leave here without her,Felicity.

267
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:13,990
Just can't.

268
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:19,770
Two minute warning.

269
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,240
Good luck,John.

270
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:10,980
They have him.

271
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,630
Clock's running.

272
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:33,970
Zhivey,zhivey.

273
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,070
Hurry up.

274
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,540
Khoroshaya kurtka.

275
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:22,150
What,uh,crime fits your punishment?

276
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,290
Drugs.And you?

277
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,550
I gave speech.

278
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:27,750
About government corruption.

279
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:28,960
Right.

280
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:34,870
It is rare to see one of
your people in Koshmar.

281
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:35,980
What,American?

282
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:37,300
Chernokozhiy.

283
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,990
Ehh... Chernokozhiy not popular here.

284
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,700
Shocker.

285
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:54,590
You think Dig's ok?

286
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,560
I think he's doing the same as he was
when you asked me five minutes ago.

287
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,460
They're coming.

288
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:03,060
They sell us Russian
police truck for cheap.

289
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,100
Vot mashina,kotoraya vam nuzhna.

290
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,670
Sto pyatisot tysyach rubley.

291
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:29,960
Na koleni.

292
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:48,350
Yesli vy sde syete eto, moi lyudi
vas, I vashi deti osanutsya sirotami.

293
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,500
What'd you say?

294
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,770
Please.

295
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,520
You know,in Russia,there is gulag.

296
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:15,740
Almost as bad as this.

297
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,130
Sara-- Don't
say my name.

298
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:29,920
If they find out we know each
other,they'll kill us both.

299
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,570
I thought you drowned.

300
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,680
When I came up,the boat was gone.

301
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:42,240
And I thought you were,too.

302
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:48,120
And I was floating out there for
days when this ship... They found me.

303
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,230
And they saved me.

304
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,320
Is that why you're helping them?

305
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:54,140
I don't have a choice.

306
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,260
I need to warn my friends.

307
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,100
You said they were dead.

308
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,570
They're not that easy to kill.

309
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:14,380
Try not to move.

310
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:19,610
It smells like puke!

311
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,330
It'll heal your wounds.

312
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:24,570
You have to go.

313
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,400
Get out of here.

314
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,450
Get to higher ground.

315
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:30,190
I'm not leaving you.

316
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:36,280
I will not be the reason
something happens to you.

317
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,920
Then we're in agreement.

318
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,760
Because I make my own choices.

319
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,740
You are a strong woman.

320
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:47,220
When I care about someone,there's
nothing I won't do for them.

321
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:52,800
Another thing... we have in common.

322
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,920
The burns,they're lowering
your body temperature.

323
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:03,480
Here.

324
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,110
Where you been all night?

325
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,390
Working.

326
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,890
Well,you deserve a break.

327
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:20,550
Um,actually,I've been thinking.

328
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,260
Maybe we should take some space.

329
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:26,230
I mean,we work together
and live together.

330
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,600
It's kind of getting hard to breathe.

331
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,450
Since when?

332
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,980
Oh,wait,does this have to with
that lawyer lady dropping by?

333
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,390
No,this has to do with the fact

334
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,440
that you've been arrested
twice in the last month.

335
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,260
Come on. I've been trying
to stay out of trouble.

336
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:41,450
My body hasn't had a
scratch on it in weeks.

337
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,470
Well,I mean,excluding the
ones that you put there.

338
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:45,470
And the other night?

339
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,060
Was a misunderstanding.

340
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:54,100
Roy... This just isn't working,ok?

341
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:55,990
Not for me.

342
00:22:58,330 --> 00:22:59,270
Thea,you can't mean that.

343
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:03,090
I do. I'm sorry.

344
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:39,200
Those men... They are Vory.

345
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:40,950
They are in charge.

346
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,810
It's best to stay away.

347
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,190
Got it.

348
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:50,520
Listen,I'm looking for a
guard named Sergei Pavelski.

349
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,370
American... You are suka now.

350
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,720
Are we seriously going to do this?

351
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:08,510
Guess so.

352
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:23,840
Fighting strictly prohibited.

353
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:33,710
Vodki,pozhaluysta.

354
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,390
You missed the tour.

355
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:39,090
What happened to you?

356
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:43,160
I saw a Russian vehicle
that I simply had to have.

357
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,600
Is that why you came to Russia?

358
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:45,700
Car shopping?

359
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:47,560
Oh,I just ordered one.

360
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:50,700
One's for me.

361
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,590
This cold room.

362
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,340
Six hours for you.

363
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,880
Six hours? You can't
keep me in here that long.

364
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:13,260
Now seven hours.

365
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:24,840
Well,that was pretty
stupid... Then again,

366
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:28,260
you never really were
one of the brightest guys.

367
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,550
Deadshot.

368
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,670
Your spine frozen through yet?

369
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,460
Trust me.

370
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,420
My problem here isn't with the cold.

371
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,380
What,you still haven't forgiven
me for shooting your brother?

372
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:49,510
Man,you really hold a grudge.

373
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,220
I know why you're here.

374
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:54,890
That girl.

375
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:56,850
From A.R.G.U.S.

376
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,790
Lyla didn't find a lead on you.

377
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:02,880
She found you.

378
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,500
- Does everyone really think that Felicity and I are...
- No.

379
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:10,670
Just everyone who works
at Queen Consolidated.

380
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,280
She's just a friend.

381
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,360
You don't seem like the kind
of man who has female friends.

382
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,090
Can I ask you a personal question?

383
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:22,080
With some vodka in
me,I just might answer.

384
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:27,760
Why does saving my family's
company mean so much to you?

385
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:32,400
Despite what Sheryl
Sandberg might say...

386
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,880
It still isn't that easy to
make it as a woman in business.

387
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,910
I've...given up a lot.

388
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:44,040
Which means if I don't succeed at
everything, then what was the point?

389
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,510
May I ask you a personal question?

390
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,660
Others have tried and failed.

391
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:53,950
Why do you try so hard to make
me think that you're a lazy idiot?

392
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:55,400
I know you're not.

393
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:59,400
Underneath that swagger,I
see you pretty clearly.

394
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:00,440
Really?

395
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:03,350
And what do you see?

396
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,920
You're intelligent.

397
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:07,850
Driven.

398
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:11,430
And lonely.

399
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:14,340
How do you see that?

400
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:17,850
Because it's what I see
when I look in the mirror.

401
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,990
We don't have much time.

402
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,010
- There you go.
- Let's go,let's go.

403
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:38,740
Nice seeing you,John.

404
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,680
Can ***

405
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:44,100
I ***

406
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:46,430
You speak Russian.

407
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:48,000
ONLY ***

408
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:50,290
I was raised in Moscow until I was nine.

409
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,680
And then adopted by a family
that took me to America.

410
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,970
Took me years to get rid of my accent.

411
00:27:56,870 --> 00:28:00,620
It isn't easy making friends in grade
school when you sound like Natasha.

412
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:09,310
Sou ***

413
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,500
Pay ***

414
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,570
I...Don't have a lot of time.

415
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:20,340
I'll be quick.

416
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:22,690
Five minutes.Must hurry.

417
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,560
Remind me to get you a pack of
cigarettes when this is all over.

418
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,400
I don't smoke.

419
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:38,510
You weren't going to
leave without me,were you?

420
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:40,200
I should kill you right now!

421
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,510
You won't.

422
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:44,250
Why?

423
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:48,370
BecauseI'm the only one who knows
where your little girlfriend is.

424
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:51,270
You're not stupid.

425
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:53,990
You wouldn't put yourself in
here without an exit strategy.

426
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:57,880
I take you to the
girl... You take me out.

427
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,330
Isabel,I have to go.

428
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:06,860
Sorry.

429
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:09,640
Do I strike you as someone
who needs to cuddle?

430
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:19,130
- Hi. - Hi. -
It's time.Ready?

431
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,900
Yeah,I-- I think she
can take the night off.

432
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:23,200
Don't you?

433
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:31,420
Felicity... It--what happens
in Russia stays in Russia.

434
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,530
Even when it makes no sense whatsoever.

435
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:54,270
Guessin',uh,you want to hold on to that.

436
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:56,260
This way.

437
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:00,850
What were you thinking?

438
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:01,800
What?

439
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:05,000
Over 64 million women over the age of
consent in Russia and you sleep with her.

440
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:11,840
So we're not doing the "What
happens in Russia stays in Russia?

441
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,070
" We're still in Russia.

442
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,490
There is nothing money
cannot buy in this country.

443
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,390
Diggle should be heading
out Lyla in two minutes.

444
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,220
Well,breaking out of prison
is harder than it looks.

445
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:28,380
You of all people should know that.

446
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,300
Stay quiet. Follow me.

447
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,500
You'll remember the rest of us... Yes?

448
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:00,950
I promise.

449
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,410
I'll come back.

450
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:07,850
Come on.

451
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,430
- Are we making a swim for it?
- No.

452
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,210
They'd shoot us the
second we hit the water.

453
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,870
You said your friends,they have one
of the radios from the ship,right?

454
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:26,630
Yeah.

455
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,120
You look like you know
what you're doing there.

456
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,850
In the past year,I've learned a
lot of things I never expected to.

457
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:34,150
You and me both.

458
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:40,990
They won't respond unless
they hear your voice.

459
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,420
Shado.

460
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:54,640
ni neng ting dao wo ma

461
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:00,770
Slade.

462
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:03,150
Can you hear me?

463
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:08,020
Thank God you're alive.

464
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:13,400
Yeah,I'm on the freighter--
Sara,what are you doing?

465
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:14,780
There's only two of them.

466
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:18,150
They haven't moved from the
location of the mortar attack.

467
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:20,830
What the hell is going on here?

468
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:23,210
You just confirmed that
your friends are alive.

469
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,750
Which means they're still a threat.

470
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,510
You know,until we kill them.

471
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:29,180
You son of
a bitch--oh!

472
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:46,390
If I say she's in there, what's
keeping you from shooting me?

473
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:49,530
Honor.

474
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:53,170
You should try it some time.

475
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,310
Lyla!

476
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:03,250
Johnny?

477
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:04,940
Ready to go home?

478
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,480
You came for me.

479
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,970
I always have. Always will.

480
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,070
Deadshot's here.

481
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,460
- In the prison.
- I know.

482
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,760
What's your extraction plan?

483
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:19,910
Depends.

484
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,350
What time is it?

485
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:27,360
YOU ***

486
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:36,630
Let's go,go,go,move,move,move!

487
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,440
This way.

488
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:57,270
Got it. I shut down the phones.

489
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,450
The guards can't call for help.

490
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,700
Your friend and that woman are not here
by now, they will not be here at all.

491
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:10,270
Much better.

492
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:12,800
on***

493
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,690
Oliver,get down!

494
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:34,460
Follow me!

495
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:35,640
Move!

496
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,610
We're clear.

497
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,600
Stop the truck.

498
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:03,150
Get out. Get out!

499
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:09,180
Move.

500
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,600
That's the thing about honor,John.

501
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,130
You can't turn it on and off.

502
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:40,030
I'm just curious.

503
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:43,580
How is it you think your
brother ended up dead?

504
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:48,810
You shot a client that Andy
was protecting, and you missed.

505
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,260
I don't miss.

506
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,160
Your brother was the contract.

507
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:58,060
Who would want to kill Andy?

508
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:00,990
I don't know the names,just an alias.

509
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,080
Hive.

510
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,960
Food for thought,John.

511
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:12,130
Food for thought.

512
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,180
Are we going to discuss
what happened last night?

513
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:46,770
Why would we?

514
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:49,150
No reason.

515
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,120
I'll see you in the office tomorrow.

516
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,050
Thank you.

517
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:09,070
You had my back.

518
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,170
And now you know what it feels like.

519
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:23,150
Wh--what are you--
what are you doing here?

520
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:25,280
Good question.

521
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:27,350
I've gotten a lot of calls from prison,

522
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,030
but never from my girlfriend's mother.

523
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:30,040
It occurred to me

524
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:33,710
that I've never been given the
opportunity to meet the man in your life.

525
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,620
I don't know if she told you, but
your daughter kind of dumped me.

526
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,830
And what you should know
is that she did it for me.

527
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:42,790
Jean told me she came to see you.

528
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,370
I told her she shouldn't have.

529
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,460
Why didn't you just tell me the truth?

530
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:51,890
Us being together...
It can hurt her case.

531
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:58,370
Thea... Your social life is not going
to be the determining factor in my trial.

532
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:00,960
Sweetheart,what you've had
to endure this last year

533
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,620
is more than most people
go through in two lifetimes.

534
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,170
But you've not only
survived,you've flourished.

535
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:10,250
I think a lot of that
has to do with Roy.

536
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:14,240
So,as your mother,I
forbid you not to see him.

537
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,130
Thank you.

538
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:28,070
I have to admit, this is not how I
anticipated my trip to Russia ending.

539
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:30,830
I just feel lucky we made
it out of there alive.

540
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:33,830
Thank you.

541
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,770
Not just for coming for me.

542
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:38,550
For doing what you had to once you did.

543
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,060
You mean working with Deadshot.

544
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,330
You know,me and Carly broke
up because I couldn't love her

545
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,400
and hate him at the same time.

546
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,150
I'm honored to be the exception.

547
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,850
Lyla,you're always the exception.

548
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:10,090
No,no,let Waller stew.

549
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:13,040
Stay for breakfast.

550
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:15,790
Throw in your blueberry pancakes

551
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:17,260
and you may be able to convince me.

552
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,490
Can you deliver this to
Isabel's office,please?

553
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:54,730
Why her?

554
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:00,750
I mean,besides the...
obvious leggy model reason.

555
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:02,700
It just kind of happened.

556
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,270
It didn't mean anything.

557
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:13,470
Because of the life that I lead...

558
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:18,340
I just think that it's better to not...

559
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,790
Be with someone that I
could really care about.

560
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:44,470
Well,I think... I think
you deserve better than her.

561
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:54,400
We have their location.

562
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,730
This one's no longer of use to us.

563
00:40:57,370 --> 00:41:02,030
Let's see how good you are... At
removing a bullet from your head.

564
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,150
Wait!

565
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,230
He could still be useful.

566
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:09,990
She's right.

567
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:15,100
Once we get rid of his friends, we'll
need him to lead us to the graves.

568
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:21,800
Sometimes I wonder who
gives the orders here.

569
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:25,090
You... or your little bouzin.

570
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,980
You're going back to the island.

571
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,490
Oliver.
