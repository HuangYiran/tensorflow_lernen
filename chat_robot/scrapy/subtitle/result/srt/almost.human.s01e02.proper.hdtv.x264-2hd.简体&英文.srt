but we found something else.

143
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,500
在那里他们检测到第一个样本
That's the first sample they pulled.

144
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,250
她所触及之处  留下的都是一个
Everywhere she touched, there was DNA from a 25-year-old girl

145
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,820
叫妮可·奎斯特的25岁女孩的DNA
Named Nicole Bloomquist,

146
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,080
她三周前在停车场被绑架了
who was abducted three weeks ago from a parking garage.

147
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,140
你是说我们找的这个性爱机器人
Are you telling me the sexbot we're looking for

148
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,580
留下的DNA都是那个姑娘的吗
is leaving this girl's DNA?

149
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,070
貌似是这样的
It seems that way.

150
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,600
怎么会
How?

151
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,430
对呀  怎么回事
Correct. How?

152
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,070
坐好咯
Ah, there you go.

153
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,640
很好  很好
Perfect, perfect.

154
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,720
你这个扭来扭去的小讨厌
Oh, look at you. Wriggle monster.

155
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,050
来
Okay.

156
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,530
妈妈要把它拿走啦
Mommy'll take it then.

157
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,430
把手给我
Give me your hands,

158
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,750
把脸也擦擦
give me your face.

159
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:41,900
真漂亮
Beautiful.

160
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,350
又发生了一起绑架案
Another abduction happened.

161
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,940
和妮可·奎斯特案一样的作案模式
Same M.O. as Nicole Bloomquist.

162
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,130
20多岁女性  停车楼
20-something female, parking structure.

163
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,360
摄像机瘫痪
Cameras were disabled.

164
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,200
所以没有绑架案的监控录像
There's no surveillance of the abduction.

165
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,840
而且我又发现了三起新案件
And I found three more missing persons cases

166
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,090
遵循相同的模式
with the same pattern.

167
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:42,430
也就是说他们先对摄像机下手  再抓人
So, they kill the cams and then take the women.

168
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,220
没错  不过这一次他们落了东西
Yeah, except this time, something was left behind.

169
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,180
他当时在车里  他叫维克多
He was in the car. His name is Victor.

170
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,850
我能跟他谈谈吗
Can I talk to him?

171
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:57,490
也许应该由我来谈
Maybe I should talk to him.

172
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,020
他不擅长跟孩子交流
He's not good with kids.

173
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,300
-还有猫  -那不是...
-Or cats. - That-that's not...

174
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,270
我可会哄孩子了  真的
I'm great with kids, really.

175
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,470
我是肯尼思警探
I'm Detective Kennex.

176
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,950
你一定就是维克多了  是吧
You must be, uh, Victor, right?

177
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,330
维克多可真是个好名字
Victor's a-a good name.

178
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,180
是一个优秀  坚强的名字
It's a good, strong name.

179
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,490
我知道这很难
Look, I know this must be hard...

180
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:42,100
但是你一定要勇敢一点  好吗
But I need you to be brave. Okay?

181
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,830
我需要你告诉我你妈妈遭遇了什么事
I really need you to tell me what happened with your mom.

182
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:11,750
你喜欢他吗
You like him?

183
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,550
如果你想要  我可以把他给你
I'll give him to you if you want him.

184
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:18,130
但是你得保证
But you got to promise me

185
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:18,970
要好好照顾他
to look after him

186
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:21,720
因为他对我来说很重要
because he means a lot to me.

187
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,710
-我保证  -保证吗
- I promise. - You promise?

188
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:27,490
好吧
Okay.

189
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,560
我相信你
I trust you.

190
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,870
听着  维克多
Look, Victor.

191
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,890
我真的很需要你的帮助
But I really need your help.

192
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,620
需要你告诉我你妈妈遭遇了什么
Need you to tell me what happened with your mom.

193
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,550
你们当时是在一辆车里  是吗
You guys were in a car, right?

194
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,960
你妈妈走下了车
Your mom got out.

195
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,750
她去扔垃圾了
She went to put the trash away.

196
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,700
然后发生了什么
Then what happened?

197
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,500
我看到了一辆车
I saw the car.

198
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,400
你看到里面有什么人了吗
Did you see who was in it?

199
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,860
有两个男人
Two men.

200
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,090
两个男人
Two men?

201
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:56,610
之后发生了什么呢
What happened then?

202
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,840
那辆车开走了
The car drove away.

203
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:02,500
是什么样的车  什么颜色的
What kind of car was it? What color?

204
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:05,730
是一辆大大的银色的车
It was a big, silver car.

205
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:09,580
一辆大大的银色的车
A big, silver car.

206
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,220
很好
That's good.

207
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,390
我妈妈什么时候来
When is my mom coming?

208
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:31,390
维克多
Hey, Victor.

209
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,940
你做的很好
You did really good.

210
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,120
怎么了
What's up?

211
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,950
通过离那个停车场一个街区的交通摄像头
CSI found the silver sedan

212
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:41,360
犯罪现场调查员找到了那辆银色轿车
on a traffic cam a block from the parking structure.

213
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,150
但是追踪牌照查到的却是一辆红色SUV
The license plates tracked back to a red SUV.

214
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,370
他们在用偷来的车牌
They're using stolen plates.

215
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:46,910
我们找了城里的每一个车牌扫描器
We got every plate scanner in the city

216
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,020
去寻找那些标签
looking for those tags.

217
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,580
我们会找到那辆车的
We'll find that car.

218
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,660
两个女孩儿被人用相同的手法劫持
Okay, two girls were abducted with the same M.O.

219
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,490
其中的一个女孩
And one of them,

220
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:56,060
她的DNA出现在了一个性爱机器人身上
her DNA was found on the sexbot

221
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,190
那个机器人在塞巴斯蒂安·琼斯被谋杀时
who was with Sebastian Jones

222
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,150
和他在一起
when he was murdered.

223
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,130
我觉得我们得集中注意力
I think we should focus on

224
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,160
去找那个和塞巴斯蒂安在一起的性爱机器人
finding the sexbot that was with Sebastian.

225
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,310
假如我们可以取得她的记忆
If we can access her memory,

226
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:02,990
我们说不定就可以看见
we might be able to see

227
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,520
那晚酒店里发生了什么
what happened in the hotel that night.

228
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,680
并且确定凶手身份
And identify who did it.

229
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,630
这是我们找到那些失踪女人的最好机会
That's our best bet for finding the missing women.

230
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,560
各位  我貌似有了一个新角度了
Guys, I might have a new angle.

231
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,540
我彻查了被你们传唤的那些人
I dug into those summonses you found.

232
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,860
塞巴斯蒂安的前生意伙伴洛伦佐·肖
Sebastian's former business partner Lorenzo Shaw

233
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,410
告他侵犯知识产权
was suing him for intellectual property infringement

234
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:16,580
{\an8}机器人制造商和前生意伙伴闹僵
两人开始打官司

235
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:18,450
并且刚刚在市中心为自己
and he just opened a sexbot showroom downtown

236
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,410
{\an8}性爱机器人发展新路线公布

237
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:19,710
开了家性爱机器人展览厅  这就是动机
for himself-- it's motive.

238
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:20,980
他可能卷入了这件事
He could be involved.

239
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:22,660
查清他的底细
Check him out.

240
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:28,100
你和那个小孩相处得真是惊人的好  约翰
You were surprisingly good with that kid back there, John.

241
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,480
即使你得用个长颈鹿贿赂他
Even though you had to bribe him with a giraffe.

242
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,770
谢谢
Thanks.

243
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,320
你觉得他的妈妈有可能还活着吗
Do you think his mother is still alive?

244
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:37,040
我希望如此
I hope so.

245
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:38,530
她多消失一个小时
Every hour she's gone

246
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:41,380
就意味着她活着被我们找到的机会少了一分
diminishes the chance of us finding her alive.

247
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,960
当某人死了的时候你怎么跟一个小孩说呢
What do you tell a small child when someone dies?

248
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,900
我从没想过这个
I've never considered that.

249
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,710
你会怎么跟一个小孩说呢
What you would tell a small child.

250
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:56,240
你和一个成年人怎么说就和小孩怎么说
Well, you say the same thing that you'd say to an adult.

251
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,810
他们会怎么说
What do they say?

252
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:02,170
你告诉他们死了的人去了一个更好的地方
You tell them that the person that died has gone to a better place.

253
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,400
为什么大家会这么说
Why would anyone say that

254
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,400
既然没有办法真的知道
when there's no way to really know

255
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,940
人死了之后究竟会去哪
where living things go when they stop living?

256
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,640
这么说可以给人希望和慰藉
It's designed to give hope and comfort.

257
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,440
减轻伤痛
To ease the pain.

258
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:18,050
人们相信这个因为他们需要相信
People believe it because they need to.

259
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:22,380
我研究的数据表明
Hmm, the data I've studied suggests

260
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,760
一个人存在过的最好证明
that the best proof of one's existence

261
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,690
就是在他们死后还有人记得他们
is if one is remembered after they're gone.

262
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,760
你搭档的儿子也是这样吗
Was your partner's son told

263
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,890
被告知他的父亲去了更好的地方
that his father went to a better place?

264
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,480
不知道
I don't know.

265
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:40,360
你没跟搭档的儿子说过话
You never spoke to your partner's son?

266
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,620
我能理解这对你来说很艰难
I can understand why that would be hard for you.

267
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,360
你们把我儿子怎么了
What did you do with my son?

268
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,130
别担心
Don't worry.

269
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:17,930
他应该已经在警方那儿了
The authorities will have him by now.

270
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,060
-你看  我们不是恶人  -我有钱
- You see, we're... we're not monsters. - I have money!

271
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:21,970
你要什么我都给你
Anything you want, anything.

272
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:23,250
什么都行
I'll give you anything.

273
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,060
求你了  我只想见到我儿子
Please, I just want to see my son...

274
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:29,430
我已经得到想要的东西了
I already have what I want.

275
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,310
不  不  不要
No, no, no!

276
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,060
你的前任合伙人  塞巴斯蒂安·琼斯
Your ex-partner, Sebastian Jones,

277
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,160
你最后一次见他是什么时候
when was the last time you saw him?

278
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,260
六  七个月前
Six months? Seven?

279
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,110
我们最近有点闹不和
We'd been sort of on the outs lately.

280
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,620
闹不和
"On the outs"?

281
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,940
你都起诉他了
You were suing him.

282
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,380
我拥有我们在奥瑞立安
I have intellectual property rights

283
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,920
共同创作的产品的知识产权
on designs we developed together at Orillian.

284
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,390
塞巴斯蒂安裸了之后知识产权会怎么处理
What happens to the I.P. rights now that Sebastian's naked?

285
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:57,950
我是说  他死了之后
Um, I mean "Dead."

286
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,280
现在塞巴斯蒂安已经死了
Now that Sebastian's dead.

287
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,960
知识产权会怎么处理
What happens to the I.P. rights?

288
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:03,290
他们当然会转回我的名下
Well, they would naturally revert to me.

289
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,370
这个是你的模特吗
Is this one of your models?

290
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,870
她不是
No, she's not mine.

291
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:15,320
这个呢
What about this one?

292
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,750
还有这个
Or this one?

293
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,580
你见过这些女人吗
You ever seen these women before?

294
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,330
没见过  但她们不是合成人
No, but they're not synthetics.

295
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:23,290
-你怎么能确定  -干我这行
- How can you be sure? - In my line of work,

296
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,370
自会知道
you get to know.

297
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,630
我很久没见过你这种型号了
You know, I haven't seen one of you in a while.

298
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,900
新型性爱机器人上还有点你身上的老技术呢
The latest sexbots have a little bit of your old tech in them.

299
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,150
她们可以与雇主建立情感交流
They're capable of bonding empathetically with their clients.

300
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,950
感知他们的情绪
Sense their moods...

301
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:38,830
并作出回应
and respond accordingly.

302
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,980
这可是个了不起的成就
It's a significant achievement.

303
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,000
要是你的机器人如此与众不同
If your bots are so special,

304
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,870
塞巴斯蒂安怎么会欠一屁股债
why was Sebastian so in debt?

305
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:47,080
要是你了解塞巴斯蒂安  你就会明白了
Well, if you knew Sebastian, you'd understand.

306
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,400
他是个艺术家
He was an artist.

307
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,010
我们发了大财
We were making good money.

308
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,860
但他却下定决心要研发新的生产线
But he was determined to create the next line.

309
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,370
要青出于蓝胜于蓝
Better than the last.

310
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:54,970
他把我们所有的资金都投入到了
He sunk all our capital into

311
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:57,250
新的生产车间  加工工具和零部件上了
new fabs, tooling, subsystems.

312
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,890
他把整个公司都押上了
He bet the whole company on it.

313
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:02,360
然后我们最大的客户终止了合约
And then our biggest client cancelled their contract with us.

314
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,040
让我们大吃一惊
Took us completely by surprise.

315
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:04,970
让我们破产了
Bankrupted us.

316
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:06,630
你们最大的客户是谁
Who was your biggest client?

317
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:11,430
如果你不想说也行
Ah, if you don't want to tell me, that's okay.

318
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:12,770
我们只要勒令你交出销售记录
We'll just subpoena your records.

319
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:15,630
在我们检查期间让你停业几天
Shut you down for a few days while we go through them.

320
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:20,870
是一个阿尔巴尼亚财团
It was an Albanian consortium.

321
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,990
他们说正在取缔中间商
They said they were cutting out the middle man.

322
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:24,570
你是说他们找到了新的货源
You mean they found a new supplier?

323
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:25,790
似乎是
Apparently.

324
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,750
塞巴斯蒂安不相信会有人制造得出
Sebastian couldn't believe that anyone could build

325
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,110
比我们的更好的性爱机器人
a better sexbot than us.

326
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:31,030
我给你看的第一张照片
The first picture I showed you.

327
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:33,250
她属于那些阿尔巴尼亚人吗
Did she belong to the Albanians?

328
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,800
塞巴斯蒂安被杀当晚去酒店是因为她吗
Is she why Sebastian was at the hotel the night he was killed?

329
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:40,410
我不知道
I wouldn't know.

330
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,900
听着  我不想再谈论这件事了
Look, I-I don't want to talk about this anymore.

331
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,350
他们威胁你了吗
Did they threaten you?

332
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,300
没有
No...

333
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:49,380
他们是很好的客户  他们总是及时付款
They were good clients. They always paid on time.

334
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,180
关于他们  我就只能透露这些
And that's all I'm gonna say about them.

335
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,780
抱歉  我有顾客来了
Excuse me. I have customers.

336
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:55,210
肖先生
Mr. Shaw?

337
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:59,950
你听过把人类DNA融入进性爱机器人的事吗
Have you ever heard of people incorporating human DNA into a sexbot?

338
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,610
那是非法的
That's illegal.

339
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,730
我以为你们知道
And I think you know that.

340
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:16,330
你可以说你不喜欢机器人
You can say you don't like robots all you want.

341
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,630
你的脉搏却并非如此
Your pulse says otherwise.

342
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:20,900
什么
What?

343
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,370
准确的说
Precisely.

344
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,810
我想让你黑进肖的客户网络
I want you to hack into Shaw's customer network.

345
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:28,820
找到那些阿尔巴尼亚人
Find the Albanians.

346
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,020
不需要先拿搜查令吗
We don't need a warrant?

347
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,490
不需要
I agree.

348
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,790
{\an8}接入网络

349
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,790
{\an8}搜索阿尔巴尼亚人

350
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,510
找到了
Got it.

351
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,700
五星评价
Five star rating.

352
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,400
有什么计划
What's the plan?

353
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,650
大干一场
Stir the pot.

354
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:13,200
{\an8}他们在测试机器人  寻找人类DNA

355
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,990
把手从口袋里拿出来
Hands out of your pockets.

356
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,430
-你见过这个机器人吗  -没有
- You seen this bot? - No.

357
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,300
没见过吗
No?

358
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,060
-见过这个机器人吗  -没有
- Seen that bot? - No, no...

359
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,860
我们测试了所有机器人
We tested all the bots.

360
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:36,120
全都检查过了  他们没问题
They all check out. They're clean.

361
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,640
好的  谢谢
Okay, thanks.

362
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,290
警官们
Officers.

363
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,320
我是经理  有什么事吗
I'm the manager. Can I help you?

364
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,830
这是你的机器人吗
Is this one of your bots?

365
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:52,900
不是
No.

366
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:54,460
我们这里有很多选择
We got a great selection here.

367
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,380
{\an8}检测到心率升高

368
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,980
我们可以给你找一个和这个非常像的
We can get you pretty close to this one.

369
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,930
我们的机器人通过了所有规定测试
Our bots have passed all the required tests.

370
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:01,680
警察有优惠
Special rate for cops.

371
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,760
我们最喜欢警察了
We love cops.

372
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,940
-是的  我们最喜欢警察  -很好
- Yeah. We love cops. - Well, great.

373
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,650
如果你能回答我的全部问题
If you answer all of my questions,

374
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:10,730
也许我能让你们迈出成功的第一步
maybe I'll let you get to first base.

375
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:14,190
你从塞巴斯蒂安·琼斯和
You ever buy from Sebastian Jones

376
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,140
洛伦佐·肖那里买过机器人吗
and Lorenzo Shaw?

377
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,300
以前买过
We used to.

378
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,140
-不过现在不买了  -为什么不买了
- Not anymore. - Why'd you stop?

379
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,370
我们现在自己做了
We make our own now.

380
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:21,530
你确定这不是你们做的吗
And you're sure that's not one of them?

381
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:24,460
说过了
Already said.

382
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,490
约翰
John.

383
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:27,910
斯塔警探有事和我们说
Detective Stahl needs to talk to us.

384
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,320
谢谢  先生们
Thank you, gentlemen.

385
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,500
他的体征表明他在说谎
His vitals suggest that he is lying.

386
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,380
没错
Yup.

387
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,800
或者是他不怎么喜欢你
Or he doesn't like you very much.

388
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:44,110
把他列为我们的嫌疑人
Add him to the list of kids and cats.

389
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:50,370
有银色轿车的线索了
We got a hit for the silver sedan.

390
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:53,060
那辆在停车场绑走克里斯汀·黑斯曼的车
The one that kidnapped Kristen Haseman in the parking garage.

391
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,130
我们在一个车牌扫描器上发现了它的踪迹
We picked it up on a plate scanner.

392
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:58,570
多里安  仔细看它经过扫描器的瞬间
Dorian, watch the sedan as it goes past the scanner.

393
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:05,610
车牌变了
The license plate changes.

394
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:07,010
他们用了跟踪扰频器
They're using a tag scrambler.

395
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:08,330
我们一发现这个
Once we realized that,

396
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:09,950
就直接改用监视摄像头
we switched to straight surveillance cams

397
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:13,110
并且跟踪它到了第八街的一座工厂
and tracked it to an industrial facility off 8th Street.

398
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,580
他们在那儿做什么
What were they doing there?

399
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,710
不知道  他们停留了20多分钟
I don't know, they were there for 20 minutes,

400
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,950
然后我们跟丢了他们
and then we lost 'em.

401
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,870
好吧  我们三分钟左右后到那里
All right, we're three minutes out.

402
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,560
那是什么
What the hell is that?

403
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,070
是克里斯汀·黑斯曼吗
Is that Kristen Haseman?

404
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,700
这不是人类
It's not human.

405
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:53,460
{\an8}识别对象
匹配  不明  性爱机器人

406
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,360
这是宾馆里的那个机器人
This is the android from the hotel.

407
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:00,050
要是他们就这么处理他们的性爱机器人
If this is what they're doing to their sexbots,

408
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:02,630
可想而知  他们会如何对待被他们绑架来的女子
imagine what they're doing to the women they've abducted.

409
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,680
迷人的绿色
Beautiful green.

410
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:15,290
他们把颜色调得刚刚好
They really have got the color just right.

411
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,680
你看  这几枪打得相当精确
You see, these shots were targeted precisely

412
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,410
彻底破坏了皮质继电器和存储中心
to shatter the cortical relays and storage centers.

413
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:21,180
他们毁坏了她的记忆
They destroyed her memory.

414
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:24,380
是的  他们要确保没人能恢复她所记录的
Yeah, they wanted to ensure no one could retrieve

415
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:27,240
关于杀害塞巴斯蒂安·琼斯的凶手的记忆
her recorded memories of Sebastian Jones' murder.

416
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,540
这些白化变种知道他们在做什么
These albinos knew exactly what they were doing.

417
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,980
阿尔巴尼亚人
Albanians.

418
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,850
这样说更合理
Well, that, that would make more sense.

419
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:34,810
不过还有一丝机会
But there is a small chance that her

420
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:36,780
她的颞骨外壳可能没被彻底损坏
temporal housing might be intact enough

421
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,800
还能找回一些声象记忆
to salvage some of her echoic memory.

422
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,900
她或许能告诉我们
Uh, she might still be able to tell us

423
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:43,150
那些人这么做的原因
something about the people that did this.

424
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,040
抱歉  朋友
Apologies, mate.

425
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,750
我习惯一个人单独做这些
I'm used to being alone when I do this.

426
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,660
你们可能不忍直视
You might want to look away.

427
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,920
没关系
It's fine.

428
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:54,960
他们为什么把它的皮肤剥掉
Why did they peel its skin off?

429
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,610
显而易见  他们也不想让我们看到她的皮
Well, they obviously didn't want us to see that either.

430
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:58,640
让我想想
Wait a minute,

431
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,480
宾馆里的监控录像里
the surveillance footage at the hotel.

432
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,960
她的手留下的痕迹显示是人类的DNA
Her hands left traces of human DNA.

433
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,620
你觉得他们绑架那些姑娘是为了采集她们的皮肤
You think they're abducting the girls to harvest their skin.

434
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,830
要是用人类皮肤
If you used human skin,

435
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,670
就可以造出市场上最高端的性爱机器人
you'd make the best sex machines on the market.

436
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:11,290
塞巴斯蒂安查出了这些
I think Sebastian found out about it.

437
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:12,390
因此他们才杀了他
That's why they killed him.

438
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:14,600
性爱机器人  约炮机器人
Sex machine, bang bot?

439
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,890
真是目光短浅  不是吗
It's a bit myopic, isn't it?

440
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:18,620
不是所有找性爱机器人的人都是为了做爱
Not everyone who visits a sexbot is looking for sex.

441
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,050
有些人只是去聊天
Some people go for the conversation

442
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:23,350
或是结束了一天应付各种有事相求的人
or for a sympathetic ear at the end of a long working day

443
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,340
所带来的疲惫工作之后
surrounded by people who only ever come to visit

444
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,990
去寻求一丝慰藉
when they want something from you.

445
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:35,130
我是说
I'm just saying that, uh,

446
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,250
神经接口是相当精细的
the neural interface is quite sophisticated.

447
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,930
总之  看上去他们用被绑架的女子的DNA
Anyway, it appears they're growing skin using DNA

448
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:43,430
来培养皮肤组织
from the abducted women.

449
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,590
合成的皮肤
Well, synthetic skin,

450
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,730
就算再逼真  和真的相比还差很多
as good as it is, is a long way from the real thing.

451
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:49,720
还要加入能增加吸引力的
There are pheromones and other biological features

452
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,290
信息素以及其他的生物特性
that trigger attraction.

453
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:54,900
就是这里
Here it is.

454
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,150
抱歉  损坏得太严重了
Sorry, it's too damaged.

455
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:06,000
如果你们想知道这些机器人从哪里来
If you want to know where these bots are coming from,

456
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:08,490
我需要研究一个活着的
I'm going to have to get my hands on a live one.

457
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:11,160
你知道我的意思
So to speak.

458
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,890
你很安静
You're quiet.

459
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:23,280
发生什么事了
What's wrong?

460
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:28,960
看着鲁迪工作台上的那个机器人
Just looking at that bot on Rudy's table

461
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,050
不禁让我思考
makes me think,

462
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:34,800
谁会记得我呢
who is going to remember me?

463
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,220
你是警察
You're a cop.

464
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,920
你帮助过的人们将会永远记得你
The people you help will remember you,

465
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,830
不管你的名字是什么
whatever your name is.

466
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,180
说到名字
Speaking of names,

467
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,580
刚刚有人回复了你的交友档案  约翰
someone just responded to your dating profile, John.

468
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,600
我的交友档...
My dating pro...

469
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,380
-我以为你开玩笑的  -我是认真的
- I thought you were kidding. - Not kidding.

470
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,650
我看到了你盯着性爱机器人的饥渴眼神
I saw the way you were looking at those sexbots.

471
00:25:58,650 --> 00:25:59,930
你的交友名字是...
Your profile name is...

472
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:01,660
理查德医生
Dr. Richard.

473
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,340
-理查德医生  -喜欢乳蛋饼
- Dr. Richard. - Who likes quiche,

474
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,430
喜欢在沙滩漫步
long walks on the beach,

475
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,510
-和爵士乐  -你居然叫我理查德医生
- smooth jazz. - You seriously did not call me Dr. Richard.

476
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,590
我以为你想找人约会
I thought you wanted to meet someone.

477
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,520
我跟不少女人在约会  不用你帮我
I meet plenty of women. I don't need your help.

478
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,700
我运行了一次身体扫描
I-I ran a bio scan,

479
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,560
看起来你的睾丸已经快饱和了
and it looked like your testicles were at full capacity.

480
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,370
你居然扫描了我的蛋蛋
You're scanning my balls?

481
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,990
-我也不喜欢这样  只是  -老天
- I didn't enjoy it, I just... - Oh, my God,

482
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:18,690
-真不可思议  -我实在没法不注意到
- This is unbelievable. - I can't help but notice

483
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:19,610
...你的满腔欲火
you're backed up.

484
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:21,570
你是有什么毛病
What is the matter with you?

485
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:30,730
再也不准扫描我的睾丸了
Don't scan my testicles ever again.

486
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:32,040
收到
Copy that.

487
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,370
她长得什么样子
What does she look like?

488
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,360
你希望她是什么样子
What do you want her to look like?

489
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,370
深邃的褐色眼睛
Brown eyes, soulful.

490
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:48,630
身高呢
Height?

491
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,580
一般身高就好
Average height.

492
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,380
我喜欢褐发女人
I like brunettes.

493
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,840
你希望跟相同职业的女人约会
Would you date anyone in your profession

494
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,090
还是与你不同职业的
or would you prefer to date someone outside of it?

495
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,700
两种都行
Sure, either way.

496
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:04,870
我喜欢有智慧的女人  比我更聪明的
I like smart women, you know, women that are smarter than me.

497
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:06,470
那不是件难事
That won't be hard.

498
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:13,020
你知道你描述的正是斯塔警探吧
You are aware that you just described Detective Stahl, right?

499
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,380
肯尼思
Kennex.

500
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,850
我们发现你要找的银色轿车了
Hey, we got a 20 on the silver sedan you posted.

501
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,680
我刚将资料传给了多里安
I just uploaded it to Dorian.

502
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,190
好的...  谢谢你...

闭嘴  别闹了
Shut it, zip it.

506
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,560
警察
Police!

507
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:45,580
不许动
Don't you move!

508
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,740
双手放在仪表盘上
Put your hands on the dashboard! Hands on the dash!

509
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,050
-放在那别动  -不准动
- Hold 'em, keep 'em there! - Do not move!

510
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:49,890
把你双手放在仪表盘上我能看见的地方
Put your hands on the dashboard now where I can see 'em!

511
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,280
转过身来
Turn around, turn around!

512
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,420
走出车外
Step out of the car.

513
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,380
快点
Come on.

514
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:55,750
到前面来
Around front.

515
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:14,290
你好  我是瓦内萨

我需要取一份DNA样本

518

请张开嘴
Open your mouth, please.

519
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,660
为什么

00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:22,530
我已经通过所有测试了

00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:40,710
{\an8}身份信息  发现匹配

她的DNA属于罗琳·怀特

找了些皮肤给你
found you some skin.

528
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:41,190
阿尔巴尼亚人不会告诉我们
The Albanians aren't telling us

529
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:42,760
绑架案受害者在哪里
where the kidnap victims are.

530
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,340
我们得从性爱机器人那里弄到消息
We need to get that information from a sexbot.

531
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:49,460
现在有三个女孩失踪  也许更多
We have three missing girls out there somewhere, maybe more.

532
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,470
我会尽我所能挖出信息
I'll pull everything I can from it.

533
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,330
又见面了
Hello again.

534
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:08,610
一个人类的DNA被用来制造你的皮肤
A human's DNA was used to make your skin.

535
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:11,900

This woman.

536
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:13,400
我们要找到她
We need to find her.

537
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,230
我们时间不多
We don't have much time.

538
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,680
你之前见过她吗
Have you seen her before?

539
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:18,760
没有
No.

540
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:20,630
我要你好好想想
I need you to think.

541
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:22,150
这很重要
It's really important.

542
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:24,970
那你见过她吗
Have you seen her?

543
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:26,190
没有
No.

544
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,240
你是在哪里被造出来的
Where were you made?

545
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:32,120
你的主人是谁
Who owns you?

546
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:37,500
你知道你在哪里出生的吗
Do you know where you were born?

547
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,030
你跟这个姑娘共事过吗
You ever worked with this girl?

548

沙琳
Charlene.

549
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,170
没错  沙琳
Right, Charlene.

550
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:55,980
你知道她在哪里出生的吗
Do you know where she was born?

551
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:59,490
谁是你的主人
Who owns you?

552
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:05,210
她可能不太懂这些字眼
She's probably not conscious of those terms.

553
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:11,540
这些人今晚要带你去哪儿
Where were those men taking you tonight?

554
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,070
他们要带我去兜风
They were taking me for a ride.

555
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:15,490
我们认为他们要带你去毁掉
We think they were taking you to be destroyed.

556
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:17,700
为什么会有人想毁掉我
Why would anybody want to destroy me?

557
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:21,940
跟我可以做远比这更加有趣的事
There are much, much better things to do with me.

558
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:25,520
如果你不想  我们也可以什么都不做
We don't have to do anything if you don't want to.

559
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:29,640
我是个很好很好的倾听者
I'm a very, very good listener.

560
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:33,060
知道吗  人们会用不同的方式寻找联系
You know, people look for connections in different ways.

561
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,120
但所有人都想找的
That's all people are looking for,

562
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:37,430
其实是一个关心他们的人
is someone who cares about them.

563
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,410
我就是为此而生的
That's what I'm here for.

564
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:46,080
你知道沙琳在哪儿吗
Do you know where Charlene is?

565
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,150
是的
Yes.

566
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:49,500
我能见见她吗
Can I see her?

567
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,490
为什么想见她
Why do you want to?

568
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,460
我不知道
I don't know.

569
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,010
你被设计成与人亲近的机器人
You were designed to bond with people.

570
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,310
你被开发出来就是这个目的
That's what you were developed to do.

571
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:05,680
他们在的时候关注他们
To notice when they're there.

572
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:10,270
这意味着他们不在的时候你也会关注
That also means you notice when they're not there.

573
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,530
所以你想要见她
That's why you want to see her.

574
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,720
这是你的感觉
That's what you're feeling.

575
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:20,840
谁让你跟今晚那个男人走的
Who told you to go with the men we found you with tonight?

576
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,410
尤里
Yuri.

577
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,230
你认识尤里吗
Do you know Yuri?

578
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:31,800
嗯  我们认识尤里
Yeah, we know Yuri.

579
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,710
清空场所
Clear the area.

580
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,490
我负责楼上
I'm going upstairs.

581
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:48,930
闪开
Move!

582
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,950
该走了

583
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,990
丢弃所有东西

584
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,930
毁掉实验室

585
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:19,260
他们会死的

586
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:22,770
他们还能生成很多皮肤

587
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:24,130
我们会在其他地方建实验室的

588
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:25,340
我们走

589
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,430
你先上
You go first.

590
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,600
他们不在这
They're not here.

591
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,500
不是这栋楼
This isn't the right building.

592
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,440
办公室也没人
Office is empty, too.

593
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:18,120
我想我能找到那间皮肤实验室
I think I can find the skin lab.

594
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:21,020
-鲁迪  -在  多里安
- Rudy? - Yes, Dorian?

595
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,620
这种性爱机器人大部分
Most of these sexbots are platformed

596
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,960
具有老式尤朱诺学习模块
on an old ujuno pendant learning module.

597
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,820
没错  DRN机器人停止使用那些模块以后
Uh, yeah, uh, those modules were available

598
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:30,770
它们就流入了公共市场
to the public sector once we stopped using them on the DRNs.

599
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,980
停用是因为那些模块会发出
Problem was that they were giving off

600
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,430
多余的GPS信号
an unwanted GPS signal.

601
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:35,370
对  这是副作用
Yeah, it was an unwanted side effect.

602
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:39,810
所以每次他们自动更新软件时
Um, whenever they, uh, automatically updated their software,

603
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:40,700
就会无意中
they'd inadvertently

604
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:45,350
发出信号从而让相关人员对其追踪
send out a signal allowing those so inclined to, uh, track you.

605
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:46,760
有这样的记录吗
Is there a log of that?

606
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,800
肯定有
I'm sure there is.

607
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,430
你能读取瓦内萨的内部GPS记录
Can you access Vanessa's internal GPS log

608
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:53,980
查看模块第一次发出信号是什么时候吗
to find the very first time that the module sent a signal?

609
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:54,990
应该可以
It's possible.

610
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:57,620
如果我们能找到她第一次激活的时间
If we can find out the first time she was activated,

611
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,070
-就能找到...-她"出生"的地方
- we can find... - Find out where she was born.

612
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:01,550
皮肤实验室
The skin lab.

613
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:05,000
好  稍等一下
All right, bear with me.

614
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:07,210
很快就好
I won't be a minute.

615
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,360
快看
Oh. Look at that.

616
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:11,850
这是那个充电器  当我没说
That's the charger for my-- doesn't matter.

617
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:13,430
找到了
Um, here we go.

618
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:14,990
就是这个
This is the one I need.

619
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:18,760
好吧  你好
Right. Uh, hello.

620
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,840
我需要连接你的数据端口
I need to access your data port.

621
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,970
这听起来有点无礼
That sounds rude. Um,

622
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:24,510
我需要插入我的...天啊  更糟糕了
I need to insert my... Oh, that's even worse.

623
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:26,980
温柔地
Um... Oh, friendly.

624
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:29,780
与性爱无关  我保证
Um, it's nothing sexual, I assure you.

625
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,600
我不是说性爱有什么错
Not that there's anything wrong with sex.

626
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,750
我是说  谁不喜欢性呢
I mean, who doesn't like sex?

627
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:34,410
不是说我
Not me.

628
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:35,930
我是说我喜欢  这才是重点
I mean, I do. That's-that's the point.

629
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:36,960
但这就有点
But that would be,

630
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,490
不合时宜了
um, inappropriate at best.

631
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:41,000
不会疼的  我向你保证
This is not gonna hurt, I promise you.

632
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,560
好了
There we go.

633
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,940
好
Right.

634
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:47,430
只要...
Just, um...

635
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:49,440
看看你的...
Having a look at your, uh...

636
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:52,180
数据记录
statistics.

637
00:35:57,370 --> 00:35:58,890
{\an8}金士顿高地

638
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,000
看来你第一次被激活的地点是金士顿高地
Looks like you were first activated in Kingston Heights.

639
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,230
安全

不
No!

646
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,150
冲进去
Move it! Move it!

647
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,330
放下武器  把武器放下
Drop that weapon! Drop it, you!

648
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:51,700
放下武器
Drop the weapon!

649
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:59,750
别开枪  趴在地上
Don't shoot! On the ground! Now!

650
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,100
安全
Clear!

651
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:13,760
-安全  -安全

安全

656
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,950
维克多见到你肯定会很高兴的

657
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:58,970

他的资料很精彩

而她很期待与你在七点见面

667
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,260

668
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,750
只是个玩笑
It's just a... It's a joke, you know.

669
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:17,860
我有很多女人
I get a lot of women.

670
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:18,990
也不是很多  只是
I mean, not a lot-- you know, just...

不管怎样  你都该去庆祝

晚安
Good night.

675
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:30,950
机器人班尼迪克又赢了一记
Benedict Android strikes again.

676
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:32,870
-今晚的约会我不能去  -为什么
- I can't go on a date tonight. - Why?

677
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:34,670
因为我已经约了我想见的人
Because I've already got someone I want to see.

678
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:35,460
但约翰  如果你

你写完报告了吗
Do you have your report done?

680
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,690
快写完了
Uh, yeah, almost.

681
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:39,940
在摧毁机器人时
We'll need individual certificates

682
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,550
我们需要单独的证书 知道吗
when the bots are destroyed. Okay?

683
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:42,280
知道了
Okay.

684
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,730
抱歉
I'm sorry.

685
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:50,960
我们不能拥有带着人类DNA的机器人
We can't have bots with human DNA.

686
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,750
她不得不停用了

我要去哪里

00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:15,060
去个更好的地方
To a better place.

695
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:20,210
你会在那里吗
Will you be there?

你记得约翰·肯尼思吗
do you remember John Kennex?

699
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,590
他曾是你爸爸的搭档
He was your dad's partner.

700
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,600
我想告诉你有关你爸爸的事迹
