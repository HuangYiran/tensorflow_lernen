不会 我们就纸最多

40
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,800
你是说 除非他答应你们的要求
You mean until he does what you want.

41
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,160
- 我们想帮助他  - 你想利用他
- We want to help him out.  - You want to use him.

42
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,530
那样不好吗?
Is that so bad?

43
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,030
你没有注意到吧
In case you haven't noticed,

44
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:57,460
Jane就不是当联邦探员的料
Jane is hardly Federal Agent material.

45
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,660
那他是加州探员的料?
Was he State Agent material?

46
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,860
都不是 但至少他想在那儿工作
No, not really, but he wanted to be there.

47
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,560
他在加州调查局的时候 破了悬案十年的

并曝光了警界的腐败组织

这事传遍了大江南北
That spread halfway across the country.

51
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,860
是啊 那些事情都出乎大家的意料 是吧?
Yeah, that didn't exactly go down by the books, did it?

52
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,530
没错 我们知道Jane的工作方式 也知道有风险 
Yeah, we know how Jane works. And we know he's a risk.

但他也有好的一面

他结了你接手的每个案子

55

Help me, Lisbon.

00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,660
国家安全出问题了
There are National Security issues at play.

60
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,460
Jane不和我们合作 除非我们满足他的要求
Jane won't work with us unless we meet his demands.

61
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,430
他太骄傲了 得挫挫锐气
He has too much pride to back down.

62
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:38,160
你得让他赢 满足他的某项条件
You got to give him a win. Meet one of his demands.

63
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,660
他的某项条件就是你
One of his demands is you.

64
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,000
那就换一个吧
Meet another one.

65
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,900
我们没时间了
We're running out of time.

66
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,430
你就这么忙 以至于你都不能
Is your work here so pressing that you can't take a break

67
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,830
帮帮自己的国家吗?
to help your country?

68
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:50,000
警长 我用无线电通知了Phelps警员
Hey, Chief, uh, I radioed Officer Phelps.

69
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,900
他会去凯马特(美国零售公司)买一个新的订书机
He can run to Kmart for a new stapler.

70
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,230
要斯温格来恩的还是史丹利牌的?

稀客 太好了
Visitor. Splendid.

73
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:17,100
看你这样子好像不情愿来啊
Not a willing one, based on the posture.

74
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,000
这样就好多了
That's a little better.

75
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,030
很高兴见到你
It's good to see you.

76

感觉怎么样?
How you holding up?

77
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,260
啊...
Ah...

78
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,860
你懂被监禁的感觉的
You know what incarceration's like.

79
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,530
不太懂
Not really.

80
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:32,130
没必要装 Lisbon 
Well, there's no need to pretend, Lisbon.

81
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,630
我们处境相同
We're both in the same predicament.

82
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,600
怎么会呢? 我自己有家 还有受人尊重的职业
How is that? I have a home and a respected career.

83
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,460
而你却因为谋杀被监禁了
You're locked up for murder.

84
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,830
你在吹毛求疵 我们都被困住了
Eh, you're splitting hairs. We're both trapped.

85
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,660
我怎么就被困住了呢?
How am I trapped?

86
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,130
因为你住在华盛顿
You live in Washington.

87
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,430
我挺喜欢华盛顿的
I love Washington.

88
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,500
说谎
High voice.

89
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,900
你为什么这么顽固?
Why are you being so stubborn?

90
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,230
联邦调查局已经答应你"不用蹲监狱"了
The FBI is offering you a "get out of jail free" card.

91
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,760
- 听你说好像是件好事  - 不是好事吗? 
- Well, you make that sound like a good thing.  - Isn't it?

92
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,930
按照他们的条款 就不是
Not on their terms.

93
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,660
如果他们不答应我的条件
If I can't live on my terms,

94
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,800
我最终还是会蹲监狱
I'm in prison anyway.

95
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,630
待在这个拘留小套间也挺舒适的
Might as well just stay in this cozy little detention suite.

96
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,600
行 你自己决定 但今天不行
Well, that's your call, but not today.

97
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,160
联邦调查局逼我来这
The FBI dragged me here,

98
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,630
除非你帮他们破那个案子
and they're not gonna let me go home

99
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,460
他们不会让我回家的
until you help them with a case.

100
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,260
所以快站起来 我们走
So get your ass out of the chair and let's go.

101
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,360
好样的...
Okay...

114
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,330
我是一个乐天派
I'm an optimist.

115

目前还没有 但我们觉得会有
Not yet, but we're expecting it.

129
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,930
他们或者是想要赎金 或者是索要代码
Well, it's either that, or they will break him for the code

130
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,260

What Abel knows could bring our banking system

133
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,200
彻底瘫痪
to its knees.

134
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,300

Oh. This is exciting.

135

这是我要处理的案子吗?

139
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,360
Abel有个年轻的妻子...
Abel has a young wife...

140
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,000
叫Defiance Schneiderman
Defiance Schneiderman.

141
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,200
不难看出 她情绪很激动
Now understandably, she's emotional

142
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,330
而且认定联邦调查局
and believes that the FBI is not utilizing

143
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,700
没有倾其所有去找她丈夫
all of its resources to find her husband.

144
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,100
更糟的是 我们还不能让联邦调查局以外的人知道
And unfortunately, we can't let anyone outside the FBI

145
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,760
Schneiderman先生被绑架了
know that Mr. Schneiderman's been kidnapped.

146
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,130
否则金融系统就会受到重创
Otherwise, it could cripple the financial systems.

147
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:34,830
纽约当局派了联邦调查局探员
The New York Office sent a FBI Agent

148
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:37,000
假扮成灵媒 
posing as a psychic,

149
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,460
但Schneiderman女士一眼就识破了
but Ms. Schneiderman saw right through that.

150
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,660
当然了 她是吉普赛人
Well, of course. She's a gypsy.

151
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,460
吉普赛女人都多少了解些通灵的事
Woman knows a thing or two about psychics.

152
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,660
那你为什么要说她是吉普赛人?
What makes you say gypsy?

153
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,300
Defiance是个吉普赛人的名字
Well, Defiance is a gypsy name.

154
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,560
你看她的卧室
Look at her bedroom.

155
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,000
那是吉普赛猫薄荷
It's gypsy catnip.

156
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,800
Abel是犹太人 那就说明
Abel there is Jewish, which means

157
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,960
她背弃了自己的宗教结的婚
she turned her back on her entire clan to get married.

158
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,260
而现在她既找不到丈夫 也毫无家庭支援
Now she has a missing husband and no family for support.

159
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,500
所以才会想找灵媒帮忙
It's a psychic 9-1-1.

160
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,100
这就是我们现在了解到的情况
Well... there we are.

161
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,430
开始行动吧
Let's go to work.

162
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,430
奥斯汀国际机场

163
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,100
谢谢
Thank you.

164
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,360
经济舱 我还想着坐联邦喷气式飞机呢
Coach. I was expecting a federal jet,

165
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,530
或者至少也得是直升机吧
or at least a helicopter.

166
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:22,730
我要坐靠近走道的位置
Call the aisle seat.

167
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:24,760
你要按照上面说的坐
You'll sit where you're told.

168
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,760
别紧张
You know, you can relax.

169
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,830
没事
Everything's good.

170
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:30,160
你还是一个联邦囚犯呢
You're still a Federal detainee,

171
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,430
并受我监管 所以我不会掉以轻心的
and you're in my charge, so, no, I won't relax.

172
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:35,360
照我说的做 明白吗?
And you'll do as I tell you, you understand?

173
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,030
我知道 Kim
Oh, I understand you, Kim.

174
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:40,100
我很了解你... 比你自己都了解你
I understand you very well... better than you do yourself.

175
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,960
你要待在联邦调查局成员的
You will stay within arm's length

176
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,730
一臂范围之内
of FBI personnel at all times.

177
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:48,060
只要你轻举妄动 就会被重新送回拘留所
Any foolishness, and you go back to detention.

178
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,760
她在岛上可不是这样
She wasn't at all like this on the island.

179
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,260
- 那她在岛上是什么样?  - 我当时在做卧底
- How was she on the island?  - I was undercover.

180
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,730
你是说你当时在撒谎
You mean you were lying.

181
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:58,360
我当时在伪装
I was using a false persona.

182
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,700
我可不这样认为
Actually, I don't think so.

183
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,560
我觉得那才是真的你
I think that was the real you.

184
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,900
而这个严厉的联邦调查局探员
I think this Federal she-wolf shtick is,

185
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,560
才是个伪装
in fact, a false persona.

186
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,330
不 这就是真的我
No. This is the real me.

187
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,130
我们该登机了
Hmm. We're boarding.

188
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,830
记住规则
Remember the rules.

189
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,830
纽约 布鲁克林

190
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,360
啊
Ahh.

191
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,730
我喜欢这种肉和洋葱味
I love the smell of reclaimed meat and onion water.

192
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,160
能借我20块吗?
Do you have a $20?

193
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,930
谢了
Thank you.

194
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,330
Liaison和纽约当局已经在楼上候着了
Liaison with the New York office is waiting upstairs.

195
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:44,000
你们两个待在这看门 
You two, stay here and cover the exits.

196

这里有两个出口... 一个在西边 一个在南边

198
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,400
嘿
Hey.

199
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,300
一臂范围 记得吗?
Arm's length, remember?

200
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,600
记得 我只是有点饿
Yeah. I'm just a little hungry.

201
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,700
我不管
I don't care.

202
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,960
- 我都付过钱了  - 走
- I've already paid.  - Now.

203
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,600
这是Schneidermans住的地方
This is where the Schneidermans live.

204
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,460
都像个废弃的仓库了
It's mostly an abandoned storage building,

205
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,060
但顶层还有几家租户
But there are some renters on the top floor.

206
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,630
没有监控像头
No security cameras.

207
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,860
哪种租户?
What kind of renters?

208
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,900
就那种边缘性租户... 像什么艺术家 流浪汉
Usual fringe types... artists, dropouts.

209
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,860
这些都不是合法居民 但他们也有自己的想法
These aren't legal dwellings, but they got a hell of a view.

210
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,400
嗯
Hmm.

211
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,900
从你发来的照片来看
In the photos you sent,

212
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,460
卧室里有打斗过的痕迹 对吧?
there were signs of a struggle in the bedroom?

213
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,200
就在这边 我带你们看
That's this way. I'll show you.

你怎么知道的?
What do you know about it?

我叫Patrick Jane
Patrick Jane.

225
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:07,600
联邦调查局请来的 他们说你需要帮助
I was invited by the FBI. They said you need help.

226
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,730
哦...
Oh...

227
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:13,760
你是个灵媒
you're a psychic.

228
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,760
大家都这么说
So I'm told.

229
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,230
好吧
All right.

230
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,760
看我的手相
Read my palm.

231
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,960
男左女右才行
It only works with a dominant hand.

232
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,860
不行 做不来
No. Can't do it.

233
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,930
我就知道你是骗子
I knew you were a fake.

234
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,560
不是 你不接纳我
No, you're not letting me in.

235
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,230
你很着急找到丈夫
You're anxious about finding your husband,

236
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:43,960
但你不想某个政府的闲杂人解读你
and you don't want to be read by a gorger from the government.

237
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,600
你感到害怕和孤独...
You're feeling scared and alone...

238
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,960
而且你不相信陌生人
and you don't trust strangers.

239
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,800
- 这不怪你 你不能相信这些人  - Jane
- And I don't blame you. You can't trust these guys.  - Jane.

240

我是说 他们是好意

241
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,560
只要你配合他们 就会找到你丈夫的

242
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,330
- 空口白话  - 信不信随你
- Says you.  - Yes, says me.

243
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:02,060
你为什么让联邦调查局找灵媒呢?
Why are you asking the FBI to meet your spiritual needs?

244
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,930
你没有自己信任的灵媒吗?
Don't you have a trusted psychic of your own?

245
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,060
有 他叫Cleo
I do. Cleo.

246

但他不接我的电话
But he's not answering my phone calls.

247
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,730
这很奇怪
Hmm. That is odd.

248
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:13,130
你能找到他吗? 你能找到Abel吗?
Can you find him? Can you find Abel?

249
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,930
你最后一次见他是在哪?
Where was the last place you saw him?

250
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:17,230
是前天晚上在屋顶上
On the roof, night before last.

251
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,730
你们在屋顶干什么?

252
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:22,230
和女友们喝杯酒

Abel带着笔记本电脑上来了

He likes to unwind on the roof. It's peaceful.

255
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,660
我想去看看屋顶
I'd like to take a look at this roof.

256
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,960
门廊尽头的台阶就是
It's the stairs at the end of the hallway.

257
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,130
嗨

你干嘛?
What are you doing?

259
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,960
猫眼后面有人
Spyhole went dark.

260
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,860
什么?
What?

261
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,830
我们是联邦调查局的
We're with the FBI.

262

我早就告诉过你们了 没有
I already told you people, no.

265

我们是另一个部门的
We're with a different office.

266
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,730
多得像蟑螂一样
So many, like roaches.

267
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:07,960
人很随和
Nice guy.

失踪那晚他在家

271

但他什么都没听到或看到

272
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,900
你怎么知道的?
How do you know that?

273
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,630
我读过卷宗了
I read the case files.

274
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,360
我以为你对这案子不感兴趣
I thought you weren't interested in the case.

275
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,160
飞机上很无聊

如果Abel消失那晚是在楼顶
So if Abel came up here the night he disappeared,

277
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:36,060
为什么卧室是乱的?
why was the bedroom trashed?

278
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:39,600
我不知道 我从酒吧回来很晚
I don't know. I got home late from the bar.

279
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,930
进来的时候 Abel不见了 房间里一团糟
When I got in, Abel was gone, and our room was wrecked.

280
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,230
他在等人吗?
Was he expecting any visitors?

281
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,830
应该没有
I don't think so.

282
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:50,330
否则我走之前他会告诉我的
He would have told me before I left.

283
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,330
这是你丈夫的花园
This is your husband's garden.

284
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,000
没错 你怎么知道?
Yeah. How'd you know?

285
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,530
他的能量在这
His energy's here.

286
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,700
他把自己的能量倾注在这座花园里
He pours his energy into this garden

287
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,860
因为他不喜欢做电脑程序员
because he doesn't like being a computer programmer.

288
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,100
没错
That's right.

289
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,200
他在那个世界里感觉被束缚了
He feels trapped in that world.

290
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,730
是的
Yes.

291
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,230
那是个秩序井然的世界
It's an orderly world,

292
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,700
充满规则和数字
full of rules and numbers.

293
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,460
但那不是Abel的世界
But it's not Abel's world.

294
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,960
他将自己视作叛逆者
He sees himself more as a rebel soul.

295
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,200
他真的很喜欢切·格瓦拉
He really loves that Che Guevara guy.

296
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,560
所以他才骑摩托车
Yeah, that's why he rides a motorcycle.

297
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,100
自己种蔬菜
Grows his own vegetables.

298
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,060
所以他才和你结婚
That's why he married you.

299
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,600
就因为我是吉普赛人?
Oh, because I'm a Gypsy?

300
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,430
是啊
Yeah.

301
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:33,430
因为你有勇气为爱
Because you had the courage to walk away from

302
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:36,800
离开几个世纪以来的传统
centuries of tradition for love.

303
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,560
你或许不知道 但你给了你丈夫
You may not know it, but you give your husband

304
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,660
做自己的内在勇气
the courage to be who he is on the inside.

305
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,860
Abel还活着吗?
Is Abel alive?

306
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,400
你何不帮我找到他呢?
Why don't you help me find him?

307
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:55,830
我能感觉到他
I can feel him.

308
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,830
他在哪?
Where is he?

309
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:00,500
只是形象不清楚
Just not getting a clear read.

310
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,460
我应该怎么做?
What should I do?

311
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,430
这个...
Well...

312
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:09,160
别告诉他们是我说的
don't tell them I said this,

313
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,130
你应该偷偷溜走立刻通知媒体
but you should sneak off and notify the media right away.

314
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:13,960
- 懂吗?  - 好的
- Hmm?  - Okay.

315
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,630
然后这个城市能齐心协力帮忙找到他
So that this city can pull together and help find him.

316
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,630
这是你救丈夫性命
That is your only hope

317
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:22,130
唯一的希望了
at saving your husband's life.

318
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,300
好的
Okay.

319
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,560
去吧
Go.

320
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:31,200
她去哪?
Where's she going?

321
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,130
她... 想给媒体打电话
She, uh... wants to call the press.

322
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:35,830
我试图阻止她了
I... I... I tried to stop her.

323
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,860
下楼去
Downstairs.

324
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:44,000
你真是很想被关回牢里啊
You must really miss that prison cell.

325
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,430
我会试着跟她谈谈
I'll try and talk to her.

326
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,530
你已经说得够多了
You have done enough talking.

327
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,700
嗨
Hi.

328
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:34,900
Jane回到屋顶后
After Jane returned to the roof,

329
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,960
沿着逃生梯到了南巷
he went down a fire escape to the south alley.

330
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,300
在那里摄像头拍不到他了
And that's where the cameras lose sight of him.

331
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,200
谁负责南边出口?
Who was covering the south exit?

332
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,430
是我 但我看不到小巷的情况
I was. But I didn't have a line of sight to the alley.

333
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:47,830
那里没有出口 所以我以为...
There are no exits there, so I didn't think...

334
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:50,360
你以为错了 这会写在你档案里的
You misread the situation. There'll be a note in your file.

335
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,030
是 长官
Yes, ma'am.

336
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:57,200
Collins不是惟一一个犯错的
Collins wasn't the only one to misread the situation.

337
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,860
你说还有我?
You mean me?

338
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,960
对
Yeah.

339
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,700
你说得没错 我也搞砸了
You're correct. I screwed up, too.

340
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:06,460
Abbott监督探员会在我的档案里写明的
And Supervising Agent Abbott will note that in my file.

341
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,030
很公平
Fair enough.

342
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:11,300
那你就和Collins探员负责找Jane吧?
Why don't you and Agent Collins focus on looking for Jane?

343
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,000
你们有内应
You have an insight there.

344
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,200
和纽约分部的Davis配合
Coordinate with Davis in the New York office.

345
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,400
是 长官
Yes, ma'am.

346
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,530
劳驾
Thank you.

347
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:21,500
这才是真的你吧?
This is the real you, huh?

348
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,230
还是专心找被绑架的人 行吗?
Let's keep our eyes on the prize, shall we?

349
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,560
失踪者Abel Schneiderman
Abel Schneiderman.

350
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,330
我们把他的绑架嫌疑人缩小到了...
We have narrowed his kidnapping suspects...

351
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:30,200
- 打断一下?  - 三个极端主义组织...
- Excuse me?  - To three extremist groups...

352
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,200
我在这干嘛?
Why am I here?

353
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,330
你什么意思?
What do you mean?

354
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:36,400
没我的事了 Jane逃走了
I have no business. Jane's gone.

355
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,400
我们会找到他的
We'll find him.

356
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,000
你们大多数都能认出这些人
Uh, most of you will recognize these faces.

357
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,430
他想被找到的时候 你们才能找到他
You're only gonna find him if he wants to be found,

358
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:45,600
而他显然不想被找到 否则一开始也不会走了
which he doesn't, or he wouldn't have left in the first place.

359
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:48,500
休息一下
Take five.

360
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,930
告诉我 呃...
Tell me something. Uh...

361
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:02,660
你帮助Jane逃走了吗?
did you help Jane escape?

362
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,060
我为什么要那么做?
Why would I do that?

363
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,360
你是他的朋友
You're h-his friend.

364
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,500
没错 但我也是一个警察
Yes, I am, but I'm also an officer of the law.

365
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,100
我不是想给你惹麻烦 我只是...
I'm not trying to get you in trouble. I just...

366
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:17,460
我需要你的帮助
I need your help.

367
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:20,900
我...
I...

368
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:24,530
我当初很确定已经让他想明白了
I was so certain I had him figured out.

369
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,700
欢迎来到我的世界
Welcome to my life.

370
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,260
你是怎么坚持了这么长时间的?
How did you make it work for so long?

371
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,260
我自己也想过
I've thought about that myself.

372
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,860
我是说 在他消失后
I mean, after he disappeared.

373
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,130
我是怎么坚持这么久的
How I made it work for so long.

374
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,800
答案是什么?
And what's the answer?

375
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,600
我不知道
I have no idea.

376
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,400
你们俩谈过恋爱吗?
Were you two ever involved?

377
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:51,630
这个问题很奇怪
That's a strange question.

378
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,760
你为什么问我这个?
Why would you ask me that?

379
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,130
呃...
Uh...

380
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:57,860
没什么 我只是... 我...
no reason. I just... I...

381
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,930
呃... 算了吧
Uh, nev... Never mind.

382
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,630
你在干嘛?
What are you doing?

383
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:30,000
等你
Waiting for you.

384
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,860
做什么?
To do what?

385
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,960
注意到我
Notice me.

386
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,360
你是谁?
Who are you?

387
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,960
Jason Wylie 初级信息分析师
Jason Wylie. Uh, Junior I.T. Analyst.

388
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,430
我在信息部门工作
I work in I.T.

389
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:47,400
分析东西
Analyzing stuff.

390
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,100
好吧
Okay.

391
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,560
你想干嘛 Jason?
What do you want, Jason?

392
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,560
上级要求我们专心为Schneiderman失踪案
Uh, we were told to focus I.T. support

393
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,130
提供信息支持
on the Schneiderman case,

394
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:56,200
但午餐时间是我自己的 对吧?
But I'm my own man at lunch, right?

395
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,930
所以我偷偷花时间找了下Patrick Jane
So I stole some satellite time to hunt for Patrick Jane.

396
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,830
看我找到了什么
Look what I found.

397
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,760
这是22分钟前
This was taken 22 minutes ago

398
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,400
在布鲁克林上空的卫星采集到的
from a satellite over Brooklyn.

399
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,560
你真认为是Jane吗? 不是什么玩笑?
You think it's really Jane? It's not a trick?

400
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,700
绝对是Jane
That's Jane.

401
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,200
立刻通知纽约分部
Notify New York right away.

402
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:21,560
谁找到的?
Who found this?

403
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,630
Wylie分析师 在他休息时间
Analyst Wylie. On his own time.

404
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,400
谁是Wylie分析师?
Who is Analyst Wylie?

405
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,400
就在那儿
Right there.

406
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,630
过来吧
Feel free to join us.

407
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,200
你是自发搜索的?
You took this initiative on your own?

408
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,460
是的 长官
Yes, sir.

409
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,960
那就看看你在主队上能做些什么吧
Well, let's see what you can do on the primary team.

410
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,630
Stanley 给Wylie在大房间里安排一张桌子
Stanley, find Wylie a desk in the bullpen.

411
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,930

谢谢
Thank you.

415
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,600

恭喜啊
Congratulations.

417
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,330
你骗到我了 把戏不错
You got one over on me. It's a nice stunt.

418
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:58,960
这下子你高兴了?
You feel better now?

419
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,000
嗯... 不 你吵醒我了
Mm... no. You woke me up.

420
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,230
我就不明白了
I don't get you.

421
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:06,030
你已经追查到 并且杀了宿敌
You hunted down and killed your enemy.

422
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,600
你干嘛非要找新的敌人?
Why are you making new ones?

423
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,360
呃 你说得对
Eh, you're right.

424
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,560
我不应该逃避
Running away was a mistake.

425
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,960
现在我准备好接受新工作了
I'm ready to discuss the job offer now.

426
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,330
没有新工作了
There is no offer, not anymore.

427
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:19,500
不可能 我们说好的
Nonsense. Let's talk.

428
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,300
我要把你送回德州
I am taking you back to Texas.

429
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,760
接下来的一周 你会面临着
And next week you'll be indicted for the murder

430
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,800
谋杀Thomas Mcallister的指控
of Thomas Mcallister,

431
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,230
以及其它指控
among other charges.

432
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:30,060
守卫
Guard.

433
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,360
你们找到尸体了吗?
You cats find the body yet?

434
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,160
什么尸体?
What body?

435
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,560
藏在Abel Schneiderman大厦房顶上的尸体
The body hidden on the roof of Abel Schneiderman's building.

436
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,860
你看到了?
You saw it?

437
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,900
没有 但花园旁边
No, but there's a large pile of soil

438
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,400
有一堆土
just by the garden.

439
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,700
冬天快到了
Winter is almost upon us,

440
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,660
要那么多土干什么?
so what is that soil doing there?

441
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,130
答案是显而易见的
That's a rhetorical question.

442
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:55,400
因为Schneiderman女士的灵媒Cleo...
The soil is there to make room for Cleo...

443
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,860
占据了泥土的地方
Mrs. Schneiderman's psychic.

444
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:59,560
他和她丈夫都不见了
He went missing the same time as her husband.

445
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,030
你在说什么呢?
What are you talking about?

446
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:03,760
Abel发现妻子和灵媒有染
Abel found out his wife was sleeping with her psychic,

447
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,400
所以在卧室了杀了他
so he killed him in the bedroom.

448
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,360
但Abel没有车 所以他只能分尸
But Abel doesn't own a car, so he cut up the body

449
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,260
然后埋在了花园里
into pieces and buried them in the garden.

450
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:14,160
他根本没有被绑架
Your kidnap victim isn't kidnapped.

451
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,630
他是凶手 已经逃跑了
He's a killer. And he's on the run.

452
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,360
你很厉害
You're good.

453
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,730
谢谢
Thank you.

454
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:24,260
你编故事很厉害
A good liar.

455
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:26,060
哦...
Eh...

456
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:38,360
希望他不是在耍我们玩
I really hope this isn't his idea of a joke.

457
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:40,660
有这个可能
There is that chance.

458
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,300
但也有可能他说得对
There's also the chance that he's right.

459
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:50,560
如果说这份工作让我失去了什么
If there's one thing that this job kills inside,

460
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,500
那就是信任感
it's a sense of trust.

461
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,300
我都忘了信任是什么感觉的
I almost forgot what it feels like.

462
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:05,560
嘿 照着点这里
Hey, let me get some light over here.

463
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,330
找到了
Well, there we go.

464
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,130
嘿
Hey.

465
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:36,500
嘿
Hey.

466
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,260
他们竟然给我分了一张桌子
I can't believe they gave me a desk.

467
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,730
你可以叫我"小狼"
You can call me "the coyote."

468
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:44,930
我不想叫
I don't think so.

469
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:46,830
在楼下他们都是这么叫我的
That's just what they call me downstairs.

470
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,330
我也不知道为什么 他们从没说过
Don't ask me why, though. They never told me.

471
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,830
你叫Wylie
Your name's Wylie.

472
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,600
嗯
Yeah.

473
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,800
就是那个Wiley Coyote
Wiley Coyote.

474
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,600
是"宾尼兔"动画片里的?
"Road runner," the cartoon?

475
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,830
不 来自爱尔兰语
No, it's Irish, I think.

476
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,400
早上好 Stanley探员
Uh, good morning, Agent Stanley.

477
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,900
嘿...
Hey...

478
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,960
你知道宾尼兔和小狼的故事吗?
Do you know the road runner and the coyote?

479
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,530
知道 达拉斯市的皮条客
Yeah. Sex traffickers in Dallas.

480
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,800
还有皮条客的动画片?
There's a cartoon about sex trafficking?

481
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
嘿 Cho 有空吗?
Hey, Cho, you got a minute?

482
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,460
嗯
Yeah.

483
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,000
昨晚Abbott和我去了趟布鲁克林
Abbott and I went to Brooklyn last night.

484
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,630
房顶上藏了具尸体
There was a body hidden on the roof.

485
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:37,730
Jane说得对
Jane was right.

486
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:39,200
他一般都没错 查到死者身份了吗?
He usually is. You get an I.D.?

487
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,460
还在调查 不过应该像Jane说的
We're waiting on forensics, but it appears to be

488
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:44,530
是Schneiderman女士的灵媒
Mrs. Schneiderman's psychic, just like Jane said.

489
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:46,530
局长希望能把他调回来查案
The director wants me to bring him back on the case.

490
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:47,930
挺好的啊
That's a good call.

491
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:49,400
他让我们出丑
He made fools of us.

492
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,000
这是他的惯用伎俩
It won't be the last time.

493
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,100
我怎么才能控制得了他?
How do I get him under control?

494
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,600
你控制不了他的 Jane就是这样
You don't. Jane is what he is.

495
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,230
他会将所有人为他所用
He'll use you to turn every situation to his advantage.

496
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:01,100
那你说我该怎么做?
So what would you suggest I do?

497
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,830
你也利用他
Use him to your advantage.

498
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:11,730
- 找到尸体了?  - 是的
- Found the body?  - Yes.

499
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:13,730
Cleo Ascencio 纽约市灵媒
Cleo Ascencio, New York psychic,

500
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:15,530
占星术士 也是医师
astrologer, healer.

501
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:18,530
还在花盆里发现了钢锯
Also found a hacksaw hidden in the planters,

502
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:20,260
与Abel工具箱里的工具品牌一样
Same brand as the other tools in Abel's kit,

503
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,060
上面发现了受害者的血迹
with traces of the victim's blood.

504
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,400
Abel杀了妻子的情人然后逃跑
So Abel killed his wife's lover and ran away,

505
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,000
和... 我说的一样
just... like I said.

506
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,330
看起来是的
Well, it appears so.

507
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:31,430
别太自责
Oh. Don't beat yourselves up.

508
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:32,930
你们自己也能想明白的
You would have figured it out eventually.

509
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,830
我说的是"看起来是的"
I said, "appears so."

510
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:39,360
他刚刚收到了一封勒索信
He just received a ransom note.

511
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,000
是一封直接送到
A third-class letter sent directly

512
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,500
Abel Schneiderman办公室的平信
to Abel Schneiderman's office.

513
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,000
都什么年头了 绑架犯怎么会寄信?
What kind of kidnapper uses snail mail?

514
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,800
这招很不错
It's smart, really.

515
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,300
老式手法 难以追踪
Low-tech, old school, no electronic footprint.

516
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:53,360
身份不明的绑架犯想要一千万美元
Unidentified kidnappers want $10 million

517
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,460
在午夜前汇入一个海外账户
deposited into an overseas account by midnight,

518
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,700
否则他会把Schneiderman交个出价最高者
or they will sell Schneiderman to the highest bidder.

519
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,200
接下来他们会
Next step would be a cyber-attack

520
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,600
攻击美联储
on the Federal Reserve.

521
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,330
- 需要我通知情报局吗?  - 好的
- You want me to notify Secret Service?  - Please do.

522
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,500
不对
This isn't right.

523
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,230
根本没有绑架犯
There are no kidnappers.

524
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:09,960
我漏掉了什么?
What am I missing?

525
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,360
也许Abel伪造了自己被绑架
Maybe Abel faked his own kidnapping

526
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,900
想要拿到钱逃往国外
to get money to escape the country.

527
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,230
推理得很好 Lisbon 这是现在最可能的情况
That's very good, Lisbon. That is the best theory yet,

528
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:16,730
但仍然有错误
but it's wrong, too.

529
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:18,830
我要到阁楼看看
I need another look at that loft.

530
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:21,430
你当真? 再去布鲁克林一次?
Really? Back to Brooklyn again?

531
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:23,400
是的
Yeah.

532
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:28,360
好吧
Okay.

533
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,330
别担心 我不会逃跑的
Don't worry. I won't escape.

534
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:32,660
我不担心 如果你再逃跑...
Oh, I'm not worried. If you walk away this time...

535
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:35,500
我知道 我后半生就得在监狱里度过了
I know. I'll end up spending the rest of my life in prison.

536
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,860
不
No.

537
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,530
我会毙了你的
I'll shoot you.

538
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:39,860
嗯
Mm.

539
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,160
看 这里有"机场购物广场"
Oh, look, they have "skymall."

540
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:51,500
"机场购物广场"啊
"Skymall."

541
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,700
好了 Lisbon 有什么事吗?
Okay, Lisbon, what's the matter?

542
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,300
是你有问题
You.

543
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,630
是因为我在办公室里说的那些吗?
Was it that comment I made in the bullpen?

544
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:13,330
我真的觉得你推理得很对
Because I think it's a really good theory.

545
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:15,700
我才不在乎那些
I don't care about that.

546
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,100
你又一次逃跑了 Jane
You ran away again, Jane.

547
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,930
不只是从联邦调查局逃跑 更是从我身边逃跑
Not from the FBI. You ran away from me.

548
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:21,460
嗯 但我又回来了
Yeah, but I ran back.

549
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,230
我怎么会知道你会回来?
How was I supposed to know?

550
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:25,130
我以为你又永远消失了
I thought you were gone again forever.

551
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,960
好吧 你说得对 我... 我错了 Lisbon
Okay, you're right. I... I'm sorry, Lisbon.

552
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,700
我... 我太不顾你的感受了
I... I didn't think about you.

553
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,460
嗯 你一向如此
Well, you rarely do.

554
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:43,460
哦 不是的
Well, that's not true.

555
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:46,060
我也为你做了点事 我... 我拒绝了联邦调查局的邀请
I made you one of my demands. I'm... I'm not joining the FBI.

556
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,600
除非他们给你份工作
Unless they make you a job offer.

557
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,530
又来了
That's my point.

558
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:52,560
你凭什么认为我想和你公事?
What makes you think I want to work with you again?

559
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,730
你咄咄逼人 不好相处
You are difficult and exhausting,

560
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:56,400
我可不想自己后半辈子
and maybe I don't want to put the rest of my life

561
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,730
都为你收拾烂摊子
on hold to be your sidekick.

562
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:00,700
你想过这些吗?
Have you ever even thought about that?

563
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,100
没... 没
No... no.

564
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,660
我没想过这些
I hadn't considered it.

565
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,300
你以为你是为我好
You think you know what's good for my life,

566
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:09,300
但两年来 你踪迹全无
but you haven't been a part of my life for two years.

567
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:16,530
所以赶紧把这个案子结了 我要回家
So let's get this case wrapped up so I can go home.

568
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,530
你竟敢说我背叛了Abel!
How dare you think that I would cheat on Abel!

569
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:23,300
还是和Cleo?!
And with Cleo?!

570
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:26,430
不 我... 我读的不是你的思想 是你丈夫的
No, I... I wasn't reading you. I was reading your husband.

571
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:28,700
你这么迷人 而你丈夫是个程序猿
You're a catch. Your husband's a computer nerd

572
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,500
假装自己是高富帅 想要和你在一起
pretending to be a rebel to try and hang on to you.

573
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,960
那样的人如果觉得自己被骗了 很容易走极端的
Men like that snap when they feel betrayed.

574
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,260
是的 Abel很爱吃醋
It's true. Abel is very jealous

575
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:40,060
没有安全感 很懦弱
and insecure and he overcompensates,

576
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,960
但你忘了一点
but you missed one detail.

577
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,160
你们很相爱
You're in love.

578
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,030
他是我的英雄
He's my little lion,

579
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:49,730
我绝不会和其他男人上床的
and I would never sleep with another man.

580
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:52,160
我知道了
I see that now.

581
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,200
- 我想一个人静一静  - 好吧
- I would like to be alone.  - All right.

582
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,600
请走吧
Please leave.

583
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,500
好的
Okay.

584
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,060
你还认为是Abel杀死Cleo的吗?
Do you still think Abel killed Cleo?

585
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:06,160
是他杀的 一时冲动
Oh, I know he did. Guy's a hothead.

586
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,860
强壮的肌肉 脖子上的纹身
Those swollen biceps and neck tattoos.

587
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:11,730
这些根据都表明他脱不了干系
The mere hint of an affair would set that guy off.

588
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:14,230
Abel失踪那晚 她的灵媒为什么会来这里?
Why was her psychic here the night Abel disappeared?

589
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,900
那晚Defiance一直和朋友们在外面
Defiance was out with her friends all night.

590
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,700
他去顶楼干嘛呢
There was no reason for him to be at the loft.

591
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:21,000
Cleo Ascencio是一个很夸张的名字
Cleo Ascencio. It's such a theatrical name.

592
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,600
你觉得是真名吗?
You think it's real?

593
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,930
是真名 我们验了指纹
It is. We ran his fingerprints.

594
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:26,430
- 我猜没有犯罪记录?  - 什么都没有
- Let me guess. Clean record?  - Spotless.

595
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:27,930
你想说什么 Lisbon?
What are you suggesting, Lisbon?

596
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:30,060
Ascencio这个名字... 听起来像古巴人
Ascencio... it sounds Cuban.

597
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,560
在古巴有个违法活动
There's a scam that they do in Cuba.

598
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,330
只要给中介一大笔钱
Brokers charge large sums of money

599
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:35,900
他们可以通过手术修改你的指纹
to surgically modify fingerprints.

600
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,100
把你的左右手指纹互换
They swap the right fingertips and the left.

601
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,930
每次都能骗过移民局
It fools immigration every time.

602
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:42,360
你怎么知道的?
How do you know that?

603
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,230
我可是警长
I'm a police chief.

604
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,960
一直闲着 只能读卷宗
With a lot of reading time on my hands.

605
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,300
我按照Lisbon警长说的
I did what Chief Lisbon suggested

606
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,630
把左右手的指纹互换搜查
and ran the left-hand fingerprints for the right,

607
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:57,560
然后找到了
And it worked.

608
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,430
Cleo Ascencio摇身一变...
Cleo Ascencio transforms into...

609
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:03,100
成为Jose Martinez
Jose Martinez.

610
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,260
他是谁?
And who is he?

611
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,500
一个骗子 哈瓦那街头的小混混
A fraud. A street hustler from havana.

612
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,060
他以扒窃为生 直到他偷到一个
Made a living picking pockets until he stole a wallet

613
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:11,060
卡斯特罗的部长的钱包
from one of Castro's ministers.

614
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:13,300
现在他被国际刑警通缉
Now he's wanted by the P.N.R.

615
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,930
是Jose Martinez?
Jose Martinez?

616
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:23,000
他从古巴偷渡出来 然后在这里开店
He fled Cuba and set up shop here.

617
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,760
好吧 他改过名字
Okay, so he changed his name.

618
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,560
但这不能说明他是个骗子
That doesn't mean he's a fraud.

619
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,160
你觉得你丈夫失踪那晚
You have any idea why he was in your loft

620
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,600
他为什么会到阁楼上?
the night your husband went missing?

621
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,100
有时候Cleo觉得有所发现
Sure. Uh, Cleo would drop by sometimes

622
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,100
他就会过来告诉我
when he thought he had an insight I should here.

623
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,030
如果你不在家的话
Now, if you weren't here,

624
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:37,600
Abel会让他进来吗?
would Abel let him into the building?

625
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,600
不一定非要Abel给开门 Cleo自己有密码的
He wouldn't have to. Cleo had the security code.

626
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,060
他自己就可以进来
He would just buzz himself in.

627
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,700
这就可以解释了
Well, that explains what he was doing

628
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,800
- 他两夜前在你的卧室里干什么  - 解释了吗?
- in your bedroom two nights ago.  - It does?

629
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,130
热读术
Hot reading.

630
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:49,500
这是灵媒江湖骗子的基本功
It's the bread and butter of the spiritual flimflam man.

631
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,830
事先通过私人物品进行了解
You gather personal effects on your subject in advance,

632
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:56,130
再以通灵术的形式向客户展示
and then you present them as psychic revelations.

633
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:59,160
Martinez上来看看Defiance是否需要读心
Martinez came up to see if Defiance wanted a reading.

634
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,100
但她出去喝酒了 Abel又在屋顶上
But she was out drinking, and Abel was on the roof.

635
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:04,160
于是他便上屋里来偷窥一番
So he came up into the house and he took a little snoop.

636
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,460
Abel下来时
When Abel came downstairs,

637
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,960
正好撞见你的灵媒在你卧室里
he caught your psychic in the bedroom

638
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,360
便认定你和他有外遇
and assumed you were sleeping with him.

639
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,960
好吧 就算这样
Okay. Fine.

640
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,400
但这根本没解释
But none of that explains

641
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,230
谁把Abel从大楼掳走的
who took Abel from the building.

642
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:18,030
的确没有 因为我根本不认为
No, it doesn't, because I don't think

643
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,500
Abel的双脚曾离开过这栋楼
Abel ever left the building.

644
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,730
如果我没猜错的话
If my suspicion is correct,

645
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:24,900
他还在这楼里 而且胳膊腿还全乎着呢
he is still here, and he is still very much alive.

646
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:39,730
咱们得留个人在这陪Defiance
One of us needs to stay here with Defiance.

647
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:41,500
- 我留下来  - 你不想参与逮捕?
- I'll stay.  - You don't want in on the bust?

648
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,360
不了 我们仨已经合力见证过够多的了 你去吧
Nah, the three of us have done a lot of busts together. You go.

649
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,500
没有什么比跟Jane一起实施抓捕更带劲的了
There's nothing like a takedown with Jane.

650
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,460
小菜
Shucks.

651
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,760
请吧?
Shall we?

652
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:02,800
一...
One...

653
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,930
二...
Two...

654
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:05,830
三
Three.

655
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:08,030
你们知道现在几点了吗?
Do you know what time it is?

656
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:10,060
瞧? 生来紧张多疑
See? Distractible and paranoid by nature.

657
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,930
若不知来者是谁 便谁也不许进门
Can't let anyone pass this door without knowing who it is.

658
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,030
到底算什么意思啊?
What the hell is going on out here?

659
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:17,930
- 问得好  - 发生了一起谋杀
- Glad you asked.  - There's been a murder.

660
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,700
你们已经说过了 Schneiderman死了
And you said already. Schneiderman.

661
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,460
不 他只是被绑架了 被杀的是另一个人
No, he was kidnapped. Another man's been murdered,

662
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,060
但你早就知道了 对吧?
But you know that, right?

663
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:27,100
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

664
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,460
你当然知道 你什么都知道
Sure, you do. You know everything,

665
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,230
你甚至知道Schneiderman现在在哪
including where Schneiderman is right now.

666
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:32,430
我什么都不知道
I don't know anything.

667
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:34,300
他就在你屋里 对吧?
He's in your apartment, isn't he?

668
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:39,430
可能在浴室 不 你很看重自己的隐私
Probably in the bathroom. No. You value your privacy.

669
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:43,460
要我说... 是塞进壁橱里了
I'm gonna say... stashed in a closet.

670
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,160
小心点 Jane
Watch out, Jane.

671
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,430
Nguyen 开门!
Open the door, Nguyen!

672
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:49,760
呃 来个人把门撞开吧?
Uh, somebody gonna break the door?

673
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,460
去吧
Go ahead.

674
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,560
好 我准备好了
All right, I'm ready.

675
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,130
你走右边路
Break right.

676
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,500
我来对付他 你去找Schneiderman
I got him. Go find Schneiderman.

677
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,800
跟我说说 Abel
So, tell me, Abel.

678
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,600
Jose Martinez死亡的那晚
Did you invite Jose Martinez

679
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,230
你有邀请他来你的公寓吗?
into your loft the night of his death?

680
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:44,200
没有 我从屋顶下来
No. I came down from the roof,

681
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,830
看到他在我们的卧室里
and he was there in our bedroom.

682
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,060
他之前在干什么?
And what was he doing?

683
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:49,360
我也在纳闷
That's what I wanted to know.

684
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,630
嘿!
Hey!

685
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:58,300
嘿! Abel!
Hey! Abel!

686
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,330
呃 不是你想的那样
Uh, this isn't what it looks like.

687
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:03,000
- 你在干什么?  - 呃... 没什么 瞧?
- What are you doing?  - Uh... nothing. See?

688
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,860
Defiance呢? Defiance?!
Where's Defiance? Defiance?!

689
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:08,000
她不在 是我自己进来的! 我该走了
She's not here. I let myself in! I should go.

690
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,160
你哪儿也别想去!
You're not going anywhere!

691
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,230
我错了 好吗? 我真的该走了
I'm sorry, okay? I should go.

692
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,860
我当时有些失控
I kind of lost it.

693
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,530
好了! 好了!
All right! All right!

694
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:22,400
我走!
I'll go!

695
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,230
他被毛毯套绊倒
His foot got caught in the shag throw.

696
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:27,100
他... 他的头撞到了咖啡桌
His... his head hit the coffee table.

697
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,600
太可怕了
It was horrible.

698
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,260
那你为什么不报警?
And why didn't you call the police?

699
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,930
在家里横躺着个死人的时候?
With a dead man on the floor?

700
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:36,030
你刚才描述的叫做过失杀人
What you described is involuntary manslaughter.

701
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,730
你原本关六个月就可以出来的
You would have been out in six months.

702
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:39,330
然后呢?
Then what?

703
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:41,700
我是为联邦政府工作的 这样我的职业生涯就完了
I work for the Feds. My career would have been over.

704
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:45,360
Defiance也会离我而去
I would have lost Defiance.

705
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,460
于是我决定毁尸灭迹
That's when I decided to hide the body.

706
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:54,860
而因为那扇吱呀作响的过道门
And the squeaky hallway door made sure

707
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:57,530
你一直听得到Schneiderman家的动静
you always heard the Schneidermans.

708
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,260
于是你便看到了
That is how you came to see

709
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,560
Abel拖着一具尸体上了屋顶
Abel hauling a body to the roof.

710
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:08,960
他是谁?
Who is he?

711
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,200
不过是个罪有应得的人罢了
Just somebody who deserved what he got.

712
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,230
这... 只是场噩梦
This... this is a bad dream.

713
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:19,600
Nguyen先生 回去睡觉就好
Just go back to bed, Mr. Nguyen.

714
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,900
我不想睡
I'm not sleepy.

715
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:24,800
你想怎样?
What do you want?

716
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,860
你想要钱? 好吧
You want money? Fine.

717
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,330
我会给你5000美元
I'll give you $5,000

718
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:30,730
让你忘记今晚发生的事
to forget everything you saw here tonight.

719
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:33,460
你是那个为联邦政府工作的
You're that security contractor

720
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,300
安保承包商
for the federal government.

721
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,060
没错
Yeah.

722
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,630
对政府而言 你到底值多少钱呢?
Exactly how much are you worth to the government?

723
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,100
我们的同事Jane先生怀疑
Our colleague Mr. Jane suspected

724
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,660
你可是大有来头
there was more to you than meets the eye.

725
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:55,360
你脸上的伤疤根本不是
You didn't get those scars on your face

726
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,830
开面条店弄的
from running a noodle shop.

727
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:59,530
你很早就是黑帮的人了 是青龙帮吗?
You're a gangster from way back. Green dragons?

728
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,600
"生来嗜血"
"Born to kill."

729
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:10,400
是纽约史上最血腥的街头帮派
It was the bloodiest street gang in New York history.

730
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,300
成员都是越南的难民
All Vietnamese refugees.

731
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,260
我听说你们在上世纪80年代控制了整个唐人街
I hear you guys owned Chinatown in the '80s.

732
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,960
是整个纽约
We owned New York.

733
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:21,160
为了记录在案 最后一件事
One last story for the record books.

734
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,430
一名"生来嗜血"的原成员
How an original member of B.T.K.

735
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:27,030
是如何差点要了联邦政府一千万的
almost took the Feds for $10 million.

736
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:29,260
你最好老实交代
Give me that confession.

737
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:32,800
把笔给我
Give me the pen.

738
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,230
你想和我谈谈?
You wanted to talk to me?

739
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:55,030
你脑子很灵
You have a sharp mind.

740
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:56,860
人们也喜欢你
And people like you.

741
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,160
当然了 是部分人
Some people.

742
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,060
嗯...
Well...

743
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:03,030
我之前还不觉得
I didn't think so before,

744
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:07,600
但现在我发觉这种关系可以长期维持下去
but I can see this arrangement working on a permanent basis.

745
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,860
我也挺喜欢你的 Dennis
I like you, too, Dennis.

746
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:12,000
我也能想象以后和你合作的样子
And I can see working with you in the future,

747
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,900
但必须按照我的条款 你也知道的
but only on my terms, and you know that.

748
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,830
是啊 我们已经谈过了 不存在什么协议
Yeah, we've been through this. There's no deals.

749
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:19,000
没有要求 没有谈判
No demands, no negotiations.

750
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,530
我们会为你提供一份职业 洗清历史
We are offering you a career, a clean slate,

751
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:26,030
为你的生活制造一个转机
a chance to make a difference.

752
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,700
你很会讨价还价 Dennis
You drive a hard bargain, Dennis.

753
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,200
好吧 不说之前的条款了
Okay, pet leopard's off the table.

754
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,860
不管它了
Forget about that.

755
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:42,230
但我要完全赦免 还有通风扇
But I need the full pardon. And the airstream.

756
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:43,900
对了 我还要一个沙发
And I need a couch, man,

757
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,660
因为这边什么东西都冷冰冰硬邦邦的
'cause everything is cold and hard around here.

758
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,460
还有...
And...

759
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:51,100
我要你为Lisbon提供一份工作
I need a job offer for Lisbon.

760
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,530
我相信有些人
I am sure that some people

761
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:56,060
会觉得你的这一面很讨人喜欢...
find this side of you endearing...

762
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:01,230
但我可不是其中之一
but I'm not one of them.

763
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,900
我会在电视上关注你的谋杀案审判的
I'll be following your murder trial on the TV.

764
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,160
祝你好运
Good luck.

765
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,530
好吧
Okay.

766
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:10,730
多谢
Thank you.

767
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:13,060
对了 好好看看邮件
Oh, enjoy your mail.

768
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:40,030
先生们 停一下
Fellas. Stop right there.

769
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,360
Jane啊...
Jane...

770
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,460
你这是从哪弄来的?
Where did you get this from?

771
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:50,200
是Gail Bertram藏着的一枚微存储器
Oh, a thumb drive Gail Bertram was hiding.

772
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,700
这事我还是头一次听说
This is the first I'm hearing about it.

773
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,830
那是因为这是我第一次开口
It's the first I've talked of it.

774
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:58,760
这些都是布雷克组织的成员
These are all the members of the Blake Association.

775
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,460
没错
Correct.

776
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:03,030
我猜Bertram留着是为了保险起见
I figured Bertram was keeping it as insurance.

777
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:06,030
可是这些人我们要么逮捕了 要么辞退了啊
Well, we've arrested or retired all of these people.

778
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:07,500
的确...
Yes, you have...

779
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,030
除了我涂掉的那些
except the ones that I've blacked out.

780
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:12,300
那些人你还没有抓到
Those ones you haven't caught.

781
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,360
我们把他们一网打尽了
We caught them all.

782
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:17,300
这么有自信? 那看来是Bertram自己搞错了吧
Did you? Well, I guess Bertram was wrong then.

783
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,230
把名单给我
Give me the names.

784
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:23,060
不过是几个法官 一个国会议员
A couple of judges, a congressman,

785
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,960
- 几个联邦调查局探员  - 我要名单
- several FBI agents.  - Names.

786
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,430
有几个来头可不小
Big names, some of them.

787
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:28,500
万一那份名单泄露给媒体
If that list ever got out to the press,

788
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:31,330
那可是把你们推向风口浪尖了 对吧?
it'd cause all kinds of turmoil, wouldn't it?

789
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:33,630
- 你在威胁我?  - 才没有
- Are you threatening me?  - Oh, no.

790
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,860
只不过是指出我们都具备带给对方
Just pointing out that we both have the power

791
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,560
不幸的能力罢了
to create misery.

792
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,600
好吧
Okay.

793
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,560
你把名单交出来 我们就同意
You give me the names, and we'll agree

794
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,000
你条款的所有内容
to all of your terms on the contract.

795
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,130
我一旦交出名单 你就会出尔反尔
If I give you the names, you'll break the contract.

796
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:51,060
你已经这么做过一次了
You've already done it once.

797
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,700
那你怎么提议?
What do you propose?

798
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,060
我提议你向我的条款屈服
I propose that you surrender to my terms,

799
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,930
也只有等我与你的合同
and when I'm finished with your contract,

800
00:40:56,930 --> 00:40:58,830
签完之后
and only then,

801
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:00,900
我才会交出名单
I will give you the names.

802
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:05,560
把他带走
Get him out of here.

803
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,360
嗯...
Mm...

804
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,460
- 那个...  - 嗯?
- Well...  - Hmm?

805
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,100
你这次做到了
You did it this time.

806
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,060
你反将了联邦调查局一军
You brought the FBI to its knees.

807
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:33,100
是吗?
Did I?

808
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,300
他们同意了你的所有要求
They conceded to all your demands.

809
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:38,130
每条都是 你怎么做到的?
Every single one. How did you do it?

810
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:39,900
还记得我们在Bertram的酒窖里
Well, remember that thumb drive

811
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,430
发现的微存储器吗?
we found in Bertram's wine cellar?

812
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:42,760
那个加密数据库?
The encrypted database?

813
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,160
是布雷克组织的成员名单
It's a list of Blake Association members.

814
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,530
我利用它作为我的筹码
I used it as leverage.

815
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:47,960
但我们一直没能破解
But we never broke the encryption.

816
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,960
是啊 可联邦调查局又不知道
Yeah, the FBI doesn't know that.

817
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,030
所以你逃跑了
That's why you escaped.

818
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:55,630
制造了一份假名单
To create a bogus list of names.

819
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:59,230
还吃了个培根热狗
And to enjoy a bacon-wrapped hot dog.

820
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:01,830
我得说 非常了不起
I have to say, I am impressed.

821
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:04,760
- 你将了联邦调查局一军  - 小菜
- You outplayed the FBI.  - No contest.

822
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,300
他们有没有跟你说我什么时候开始工作?
Did they tell you when I start work?

823
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,930
是"我们"
When we start.

824
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:10,260
我们?
We?

825
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,630
那你的工作怎么办?
What about your job?

826
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:13,730
- 算了吧 太无聊了  - 是啊 我就说的嘛
- Nah. It was boring.  - Yeah, I told you.

827
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:15,560
没错 但你无权这么说
Yeah. But you had no right to.

828
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,330
那是我的生活 我才有发言权
It's my life, and I'll decide what to do with it.

829
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:20,000
- 那你真是相当明智  - 根本没有别的选择啊
- And you decided correctly.  - There was never any choice.

830
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,930
别这样 会很有趣的
Oh, come on. It'll be fun.

831
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:23,800
看看咱们能捅出多大的篓子
Let's see what kind of trouble we can make.

832
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,500
我要送你一样东西
I got you something.

833
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,830
给我的?
For me?

834
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:28,700
嗯
Mm-hmm.

835
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:37,960
你给我买了袜子
You got me socks.
