2
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:33,360
That way

3
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:37,836
Xiao Cheng, would this end up like last time?

4
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:38,767
Don't worry

5
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,464
We've got everything here

6
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:42,040
Even gloves

7
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:44,610
We won't leave fingerprints

8
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:45,609
Go over there and take a look

9
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:47,042
Somebody is coming

10
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:55,417
Stop!

11
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,789
Pal, we are penniless

12
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:58,915
This is outrageous!

13
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:00,014
Taking police officers as thieves

14
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:01,489
Freeze!

15
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:04,221
Oh, it's the cops

16
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,661
We're scared

17
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:07,164
Tell the truth, it's late

18
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:09,030
What are you two doing here?

19
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:09,897
We are...

20
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:12,870
We are...putting up posters

21
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:13,631
Right

22
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:15,031
Putting up posters late at night?

23
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:16,165
Officer, you don't believe us

24
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:17,174
Let us demonstrate

25
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,340
Broom

26
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:20,403
Glue

27
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,173
Put up a poster

28
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:26,644
Okay

29
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:30,182
Officer, see, it's done

30
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,316
We are so skillful

31
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:34,320
Don't fool me

32
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:35,621
That doesn't look like a poster

33
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:37,520
It's highly competitive nowadays

34
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,291
Advertisements have to be creative

35
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:40,559
Right...have to be creative

36
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:41,656
Don't work too late

37
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:42,792
The society order is worse than before

38
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:44,369
See you, bye

39
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:45,961
We'll go home after finishing this job

40
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:48,131
You shut up. Let's go now

41
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:52,340
That way

42
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:57,274
Nothing there

43
00:01:57,383 --> 00:01:57,781
Nothing

44
00:01:57,884 --> 00:01:58,646
Over there...

45
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:09,328
Hey, anything there?

46
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:10,157
Nothing

47
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:12,225
Then why don't you come down now?

48
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:16,366
What are we supposed to do now?

49
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:18,131
Let's go

50
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,604
Looks like we've got nothing again

51
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:27,407
Real bad luck

52
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,281
So do you have another plan?

53
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:30,110
I do

54
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:31,148
What is it?

55
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:31,979
Let's go home

56
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,350
Then we won't get anything

57
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:41,922
Let's start working

58
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,281
Nobody there

59
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:07,347
Nobody is there

60
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:12,249
But the re" re valuables

61
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:15,756
What happened?

62
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:17,187
What are you doing?

63
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:18,730
Doesn't matter, just an accident

64
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:19,889
Use plan B

65
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:31,639
Are you ready?

66
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:32,210
Yes

67
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:39,280
Let's go now

68
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:56,026
Go

69
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:54,086
Shit, go hide away

70
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:55,791
You are no good

71
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:57,760
But we are bound together

72
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:02,560
I am coming in

73
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,008
You are really horny

74
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:18,550
The proverb goes, "t steal your friend's wife"

75
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:24,189
My friend is away, so I try my best

76
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:28,492
So what have you done?

77
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:30,420
Use my charm

78
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:34,297
Forget it

79
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,389
My husband has style

80
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:38,301
Me too

81
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:40,031
My husband has beautiful hair

82
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:42,899
I had beautiful hair when I was young

83
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,473
My husband is good in bed

84
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:46,806
Me too

85
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:48,141
My husband delivers newspapers

86
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:49,339
I deliver newspapers too

87
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:52,909
So you two are in same business

88
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:56,577
Come on

89
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:58,620
What?!

90
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:01,387
You're so bad

91
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:02,153
What are you afraid of?

92
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:03,592
I am your husband's good friend

93
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:04,560
Damn

94
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:06,294
Come on

95
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,058
No

96
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:09,866
Are you alright?

97
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:10,367
I'm alright

98
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,630
Why are you so careless?

99
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:14,501
I have something for you

100
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:15,039
Really?

101
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:15,766
Yes

102
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,278
You two are really kinky

103
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:24,681
Don't try to explain

104
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:26,411
You know what you are doing

105
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,986
We've known about your affair

106
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:29,679
No only you know and I know

107
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,017
He also knows

108
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:31,756
Do you know?

109
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:32,517
I know

110
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:33,717
You two...

111
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:35,893
I don't even know who you both are!

112
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:37,660
She is not your wife?

113
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:38,792
Not really

114
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,126
Oh, I'm sorry

115
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,063
It's a mistake...

116
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,361
I'm sorry

117
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:44,565
Sorry. I make a mistake...Oh

118
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:45,796
Really...sorry

119
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,133
Sorry

120
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,468
A mistake

121
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:49,336
It's a mistake

122
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,034
A real mistake

123
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,338
He used to go through windows

124
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:56,142
Sorry

125
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,147
Goodbye

126
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,649
Bye-bye

127
00:06:58,751 --> 00:06:59,740
Sorry, goodbye

128
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:02,981
One moment worth a thousand gold bars

129
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,021
We just spoiled the occasion

130
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:05,590
One moment worth a thousand gold pieces

131
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:06,658
You two go on

132
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:07,657
Don't stop

133
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,196
Thieves, thieves...

134
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:34,219
Uncle Bill, congratulations!

135
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,412
You are free again

136
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:37,213
It's very boring inside

137
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:38,415
Just want to go out and get some air

138
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:40,256
Please come back when you have time

139
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:41,582
No, thanks

140
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:44,254
I won't be back again

141
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:45,790
Uncle Bill

142
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:51,198
It's so good to see you getting out

143
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,464
Let me wipe off your bad luck

144
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:53,766
Wipe once, money comes

145
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:55,101
Wipe twice, big fortune comes

146
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:55,970
Last wipe

147
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:58,043
Gone all the bad, comes all the good

148
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,705
Who teaches you such rubbish?

149
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:06,643
Where's my darling?

150
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:07,949
Over there

151
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:15,123
My darling, Carol

152
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:22,526
Look at this horse

153
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:23,329
I take good care of her

154
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:24,835
Not even a drop of sweat on her skin

155
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:26,564
If so, she might get dry skin

156
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,770
Uncle Bill, your darling

157
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:30,638
...gets sick often

158
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:32,404
and has a bad temper

159
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:36,275
She'll be better when she has a boyfriend

160
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:37,144
That makes sense

161
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:40,211
Uncle Bill, let's have tea

162
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:40,751
Fine

163
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:51,158
Come with me

164
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,159
Okay

165
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:57,328
Let's go

166
00:08:57,436 --> 00:08:58,596
Okay...wait a sec

167
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,505
"Fat Kee Restaurant"

168
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,442
Uncle Bill, the shark's fin soup is tasty in here

169
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,639
It's better than the veggie bean curd soup in jail

170
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:10,010
You can try if you don't believe me

171
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:14,311
This meal is our treat

172
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,149
Help yourself and order whatever you want

173
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,885
Waiter...

174
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:21,557
What are you doing?

175
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:23,094
Are you blind?

176
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:25,056
I'm sorry, miss

177
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:27,496
I'm not blind, my eyesight is not good

178
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:31,434
Be careful next time

179
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:32,663
I'm sorry

180
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:38,841
Gosh, just get another purse

181
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,572
Don't run, stay there!

182
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:54,689
Why you keep running away from me?

183
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:56,392
You think I, the Big Bro, can't pay

184
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:57,553
You think I have no money

185
00:09:57,663 --> 00:09:58,925
You don't believe I have money

186
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:00,658
You don't know I have money

187
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:01,630
I haven't paid yet

188
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:03,964
How do you know I have no money?

189
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:07,062
Give him a good scolding

190
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:09,397
See, he wears a nice suit

191
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:10,668
How is it that he can't pay for his bill?

192
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:11,367
Needless to say!

193
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:12,068
Big Bro, I...

194
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:13,042
I... what?

195
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:14,077
Lucky he's a gentleman

196
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,478
As compared to me you're pretty easygoing

197
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:17,913
Big Bro, be cool

198
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:20,315
We are reasonable people

199
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:21,215
Yes...

200
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:22,485
It's not easy to tell

201
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:23,987
you are a nice guy

202
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,058
It's nice to have tea with a friend

203
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:27,648
Let me treat you a cup of tea

204
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,727
Thanks

205
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,056
Next time, maybe next time

206
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:30,753
There's always next time

207
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:31,488
Goodbye

208
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:32,359
I'll treat you next time

209
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,363
Bye

210
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:38,761
That guy is really something

211
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:40,527
Where's Uncle Bill?

212
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:41,974
He's out, will be back soon

213
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:42,768
Let's have tea first

214
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:49,876
What?

215
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:52,541
You know what

216
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:54,250
Nuts

217
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:55,081
Don't know what you are talking about

218
00:10:58,357 --> 00:10:59,051
Whafs this?

219
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:00,387
This is a purse

220
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:10,124
Give it to me, I am taking it back

221
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:12,865
A kid is a kid

222
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:14,769
Always get dizzy with his success

223
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:15,431
Look at you

224
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:16,906
Do you want to spend your life in jail?

225
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:18,267
Do something else while you're still young

226
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:20,436
There're lots of things to do, don't do this

227
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:23,174
Gaining at others' expense is vile & lowly, you know?

228
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:24,977
r think of getting married and have children?

229
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:25,880
Yes

230
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:26,849
Don't even think about it

231
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:28,783
You'll hurt your children

232
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:30,378
You are still young

233
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:32,252
You can do what you want, but not this

234
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,189
You have to change before getting married

235
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:35,453
Turn from the bad ways and be good again

236
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:35,959
Understand?

237
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:36,653
Understand

238
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:37,990
Raise your head and be a good person

239
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:39,821
Okay

240
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:40,694
That's good

241
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:42,695
Okay

242
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:46,568
Raise your head and be good

243
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:50,204
Uncle Bill, have some tea

244
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:52,972
This is my purse

245
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:53,875
How come it's here?

246
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:54,707
That's strange

247
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:56,105
Someone steals it

248
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:59,151
Who'd dare to pluck a tiger's hair?

249
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:00,377
How dare...I...

250
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:01,851
Luckily you have Uncle Bill here

251
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:03,087
Uncle Bill

252
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:04,156
What a shame

253
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:09,792
Captain...

254
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:13,790
Raise your head and be good

255
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:16,594
Captain...

256
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,333
Xiao Du

257
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:29,974
Whafs the rush?

258
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:54,702
Captain...

259
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:57,231
Did you drop the money?

260
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:00,444
How many times have you done today?

261
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:01,513
None

262
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:02,475
None?

263
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:03,479
None, really?

264
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:04,139
Search him

265
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:04,875
Please don't

266
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:06,008
Shut up

267
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:08,081
Let me do it...

268
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:09,815
I've done nothing

269
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,612
Oh, my purse

270
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:14,484
Come back

271
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:18,527
Captain...

272
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:19,097
Still want to go

273
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:20,597
My purse is stolen

274
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:21,961
I want to look for my purse

275
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:23,432
Your purse is stolen

276
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:26,437
You've got your match

277
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,268
Let's go to get the tiger

278
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:29,170
Tiger?

279
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:30,805
Is that true?

280
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,104
Of course

281
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:33,307
Let's go, Kitty

282
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:38,942
Uncle Bill

283
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:40,075
The shark's fin soup is good in here, isn't it?

284
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:42,247
I won't lie to you

285
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:45,980
Captain, that old guy inside

286
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:47,820
is a pro in this trade

287
00:13:57,803 --> 00:13:58,633
Take a good look

288
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:00,935
This have nothing to do with me

289
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,836
I have to go

290
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:06,374
Captain...

291
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:09,976
Still want to run?

292
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:11,506
What are you two doing here?

293
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:12,311
Captain...

294
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:13,646
He can't get away today

295
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:14,116
He is...

296
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,482
He is the one we're looking for

297
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:16,054
That's mean...

298
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:17,383
We are looking for him all day

299
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:18,421
Cut the crap, take him back

300
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,354
I'll go first, Captain

301
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:21,352
Then go

302
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,026
Captain, your team is efficient

303
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:28,865
Captain, what do you want to eat?

304
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:29,730
The usual

305
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:30,460
Okay

306
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:34,429
Where's my purse?

307
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,006
Captain

308
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:36,165
Shut up

309
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:37,139
Yes...

310
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:38,802
Damn it

311
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,705
Move aside...

312
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:44,441
Let go of me

313
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:47,248
Sorry. I'm sorry

314
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:48,320
Take care

315
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:50,553
Uncle Bill, where are we going to?

316
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:53,054
To my family

317
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:55,092
Your...family

318
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:57,162
You two orphans don't have one

319
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:58,594
Uncle Bill, you're blessed

320
00:14:58,697 --> 00:14:59,561
Follow me

321
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:02,433
Don't know what he's going to do

322
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:03,091
Uncle Bill

323
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,970
"Yuan Ji Bean Curd"

324
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:12,370
Where are the young ladies?

325
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,109
Old lady, please come again

326
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:17,147
Take care

327
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:41,664
Hey, she ignores you

328
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:46,804
Miss, why don't you take a look at me?

329
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:48,372
Let me introduce myself

330
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,879
My family is Lee, first name Cha

331
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:52,075
Richard is my English name

332
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:54,084
I come all the way to pay you a visit

333
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:55,614
Do you want to buy bean curd?

334
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:57,315
Yes

335
00:15:57,423 --> 00:16:00,881
But I have to check if or not your bean curd is smooth

336
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:02,051
How much do you want?

337
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:03,355
Can I try some first?

338
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:06,960
What do you want?

339
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:08,556
Put them on my hand

340
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:19,008
The bean curd is smooth and smells good

341
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:20,601
I really love them

342
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:24,110
Tonight I'll be satisfied with just the beancurd

343
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:27,310
Sir, you haven't paid yet

344
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,609
Sorry

345
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,755
The money is in my pocket

346
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:34,621
You take it by yourself

347
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:38,287
Why don't you take the money?

348
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:39,659
Come on

349
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:41,027
Take it

350
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,765
If you don't take it, I'm leaving now

351
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:54,205
What are you doing?

352
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:56,474
Hey, think you're a monk taking alms

353
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:58,243
Had your food and not paying for it!

354
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,312
No

355
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:00,612
I want to pay but she doesn't take the money

356
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:01,481
Yes

357
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:05,580
She's generous

358
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:06,749
Right

359
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,887
You don't have to pay, right?

360
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:09,926
That's right

361
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:10,961
She didn't get the money, right?

362
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:11,927
She didn't

363
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:12,793
I'll get it

364
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:23,839
Did you get it?

365
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,243
Lucky I haven't got hurt

366
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:32,179
Go on...I'm asking you to eat

367
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:33,182
What are you doing?

368
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,685
Now I'm really eating bean curd

369
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:42,727
Let him go. You've already taught him a lesson

370
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:43,692
Forget it

371
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:45,454
Just that

372
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:46,531
You really don't give me face

373
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:48,224
Rubbish. Pay me the money

374
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,027
Damn you

375
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:50,300
Let's forget it

376
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:54,669
You bitch

377
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:55,671
You wait and see

378
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:56,570
Don't go away

379
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:57,835
Big Bro, shall we go now?

380
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:00,139
Sure, let's go

381
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:02,145
Be careful

382
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:02,736
Little brat

383
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:04,543
Stay longer and I'll beat you to death

384
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,584
You have to beat up these guys

385
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:08,418
Sis, if someone bullies you next time

386
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,612
You have to tell me

387
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:11,587
Ah Yuan, Ah Ji

388
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,624
Why are you so upset?

389
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:16,250
Brother Wai, where's the dumplings?

390
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:18,526
Oh, I forget to bring the money

391
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:20,493
So you haven't bought the dumplings

392
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,194
I'll buy you more tomorrow, okay?

393
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:23,700
Right

394
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,326
I'll buy tomorrow for sure

395
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:26,865
It's okay if you buy them after tomorrow

396
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:33,277
Brother Wai, why are you so late today?

397
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:35,172
I had some work to do

398
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,110
That's why I'm late

399
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:38,813
Yuan, we...

400
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:40,145
Sorry---excuse me

401
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,282
Yuan, I...

402
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:44,446
Sorry, excuse me

403
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:48,785
Hey, miss

404
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:50,885
Can you let me talk to your sister?

405
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:53,489
Okay, I'll give you a chance

406
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:54,657
But...

407
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:55,664
But what?

408
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:57,632
Help me take the soy beans inside

409
00:18:57,736 --> 00:18:58,828
What?

410
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:00,768
Help you take the soy beans? I'm a Captain

411
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:01,771
So you want to do it or not?

412
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:02,499
No

413
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:03,706
Brother Wai

414
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:06,342
Yuan, what's up?

415
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:08,504
Just listen to her this time

416
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:11,239
No next time

417
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:14,586
That's better

418
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:18,690
It's over there, hurry up

419
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:23,591
That's the bitch

420
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:24,787
That's her

421
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:25,620
So many people here

422
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,130
Probably want to scare your sister

423
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:30,395
Hey, beat her up

424
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:33,605
What are you doing?

425
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,165
Leave me alone

426
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:39,635
Stop fighting

427
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:41,778
Let me go

428
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,245
Oh, shit

429
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:45,508
Yuan

430
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:46,943
Brother Wai, they are...

431
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:48,783
Let me go

432
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:51,819
That bitch is playing tough

433
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:53,619
Let me give you a few slaps first

434
00:19:58,697 --> 00:19:59,595
Captain

435
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:00,655
What?

436
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,734
We have to teach this little bitch a lesson

437
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:05,592
Let her go

438
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:06,966
Let her go?

439
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:07,800
Give me some face

440
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:08,736
Are you crazy?

441
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,966
Look at my nose

442
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:10,803
Can't let her go

443
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:12,509
Don't even give me some face?

444
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:13,236
No

445
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:17,908
My nose is broken again

446
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:18,846
Beat him up

447
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:27,375
Let me do it myself

448
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:28,214
Okay

449
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:31,584
Beat me?

450
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:36,490
Hey, you...

451
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:38,488
Come with me

452
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:41,022
You dare to lock me up?

453
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:41,895
So what?

454
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,093
Do you know what will happen to you?

455
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:45,092
I know

456
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:47,068
What?...

457
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,568
Let's go

458
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:51,774
Brother Wai, wait

459
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:52,775
Brother Wai...

460
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:53,503
Okay, I know

461
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:56,410
Brother Wai, buy more buns tomorrow

462
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:43,650
Let's dance...

463
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:22,162
Sorry, excuse me

464
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:23,165
Captain

465
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:38,946
Stop...

466
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,178
Still run, stop

467
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:46,020
I'll shoot if you don't stop

468
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,120
I just ask you to stop

469
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,060
Why are you keep going?

470
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:54,828
You've talked a lot

471
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,423
I don't know if it's true or not

472
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:56,899
Yes

473
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:58,196
Take a close look

474
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,631
Oh, it's Captain

475
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:02,101
Now you know

476
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:05,438
I am going to charge you with

477
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:07,512
disturbing public order and

478
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:10,137
stealing from other people

479
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:11,215
Now I have to lock you up

480
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:13,443
Ah, lock me up

481
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:15,577
Don't you know

482
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:18,417
the bald detective Karl Maka

483
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:20,081
is my brother?

484
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:21,887
Karl Maka? Who is he?

485
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:23,358
We're two of a kind

486
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:24,588
We've gone through many tough situations

487
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:25,890
I've saved his life

488
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:27,464
That's right

489
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:28,697
He's so famous

490
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,030
If you haven't met him you should've heard him

491
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:32,766
And also

492
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:34,839
The renowned private eye Mr. George Lam

493
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,100
He's my cousin

494
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:38,438
His partner, that over-aged Teddy Robin

495
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:39,908
used to work for me too

496
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:41,000
So you are...

497
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:42,044
Listen,

498
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,478
I'm a friend of Hiroshimataro Tsui Hark

499
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:46,176
The consulate general to Japan

500
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:48,585
Friend means buddies

501
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:50,984
Maybe I get the wrong guy

502
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:52,454
You're right

503
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:53,990
With my high position and reputation

504
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:55,457
I won't do anything against the law

505
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,151
Right, Captain?

506
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:57,626
I'm sorry, really sorry

507
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:01,991
Uncle Bill, let's forget it

508
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,761
Right, you're very kind

509
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:04,528
Okay

510
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:06,297
We forgive you this time

511
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:07,605
Let's go

512
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:13,739
Stop

513
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:20,977
I'm really sorry

514
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:23,213
Please say something good about me to Maka

515
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:24,618
My name is Tie Liwai

516
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:27,285
Well, I'll see

517
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:28,256
But you have to remember

518
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,794
Lower your voice when asking people to stop next time

519
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:32,552
Yes, I won't shout next time

520
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:33,494
Thank you...

521
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:40,063
Come and buy these colorful figurines

522
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:41,160
Take a look

523
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:42,969
You two wait here

524
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:44,336
I want to buy something home

525
00:25:44,442 --> 00:25:45,602
Don't go away

526
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:47,308
How much is this one?

527
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:48,208
Twenty cents each

528
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:49,143
So expensive

529
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:50,077
That's not expensive

530
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:51,045
How about this one? How much?

531
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:51,945
This one is fifteen cents

532
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,779
Fifteen cents, I don't want it

533
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:56,553
We're wasting time here

534
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:58,623
Let's go to Uncle Bill's home first, okay?

535
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:00,986
Granny, I'm hungry

536
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:01,990
Let's go to buy some buns

537
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:03,025
Where is it?

538
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:12,897
No. 48, Jinchuen Street

539
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:16,800
Xiao Qi, it's there

540
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,307
Over there, look

541
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,843
It's here

542
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:20,604
Right

543
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:21,603
Let me go inside first

544
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:22,941
To see what his daughter looks like

545
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:24,914
You go inside

546
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:25,778
What are you afraid of?

547
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:27,181
If I'm right

548
00:26:27,285 --> 00:26:29,651
She must have a long neck or flat ass

549
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,346
Or limbs like frogs

550
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:34,084
Or goldfish eyes and a lion's mouth

551
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,888
Don't be so mean okay?

552
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:38,019
Believe it or not

553
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:40,355
Hide away

554
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:41,489
I'll go and take a look first

555
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,225
Please

556
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:53,240
Xiao Qi, look at this girl

557
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:54,812
Countryfolk have rough hands and feet

558
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:56,210
They wear shoes without socks

559
00:26:57,482 --> 00:26:58,039
Right

560
00:26:58,383 --> 00:26:59,873
They wear clothes but prefer not button up

561
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:02,476
Right, they don't button up their clothes

562
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:06,818
And they sit down with legs wide open

563
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:08,857
Right, with legs wide open

564
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,689
And trouser legs rolled up high

565
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:16,057
They walk like ducks and goose

566
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:19,168
And work around clumsily

567
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:21,965
This is the kind of a woman

568
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:24,473
you should always avoid

569
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:25,838
If you got stuck with her

570
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:28,174
You would never get rid of her

571
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:28,711
That's real trouble

572
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:29,541
It is

573
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:35,050
Are you alright?

574
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:35,676
That's awesome

575
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:37,015
I'm alright

576
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:38,714
You two little brat

577
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:41,553
Having nothing to do but tease girls

578
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:44,020
Hey, tiny tot

579
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:45,323
It's you who hit us first

580
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:46,089
What do you want?

581
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:47,357
Want to pick a fight?

582
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:48,227
Tiny tot, do you want to hit me

583
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,630
Xiao Ji, what are you doing?

584
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:50,967
What happened?

585
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:53,060
These little brat want to pick a fight

586
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:54,570
There's a miracle

587
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:56,100
Forget it.. Just ignore them

588
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:57,037
Come inside and work

589
00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:57,870
Come in

590
00:27:59,477 --> 00:28:00,136
Tiny tot

591
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:02,076
Without this sister you're finished

592
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,112
Can't keep your mouth shut

593
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:05,113
Xiao Ji

594
00:28:06,985 --> 00:28:08,282
This bean curd is for selling

595
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:10,120
You go to hell

596
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:11,813
Stop throwing

597
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:14,320
You go to hell

598
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:15,290
Stop it

599
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,854
Where're the brats going?

600
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,390
Beauties

601
00:28:20,498 --> 00:28:21,465
What are you two doing?

602
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:25,135
Dad...

603
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:26,529
Dad?

604
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:27,798
Throw some more

605
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,773
Uncle Bill

606
00:28:40,618 --> 00:28:41,915
Dad, have a cup of hot tea first

607
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:48,987
I come all the way home

608
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:50,425
Just want to see you two

609
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,158
And you just treat me like that

610
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:57,059
Dad, Xiao Ji doesn't do it on purpose

611
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,059
No, I do it on purpose

612
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:06,006
Xiao Ji, you can't do this to Dad

613
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:07,373
Why not?

614
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:08,707
Although he's my Dad

615
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:10,542
he never took up his duty as a father

616
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:12,013
A father sends his children to school

617
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:13,482
Have you done this?

618
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,177
A father loves and teaches his children

619
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:16,378
Have you done this?

620
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:17,147
Without a word

621
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,654
You have left home a couple of years

622
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,782
You never think about home

623
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:21,984
Just leave the two of us

624
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:25,153
making bean curds at home every day

625
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:28,755
Cutting bean curds, selling bean curds

626
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:29,925
And being teased by people

627
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:30,762
Sis

628
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,336
We have bean curd three meals a day

629
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:37,606
And you

630
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:39,404
What kind of father you are

631
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:43,774
Mom died but her mind was not in peace

632
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:45,577
Don't you feel sorry?

633
00:29:47,685 --> 00:29:50,153
Ah, what a...

634
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:52,120
...bean curd story

635
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:55,152
It's full of tears

636
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,187
And very touching

637
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,785
Makes people feel sad

638
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:00,626
and tears rolling down

639
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:06,367
Quiet

640
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:12,934
You're right

641
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:16,580
It's my fault for not taking care of family

642
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:20,048
It's my fault not sending you to school

643
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:22,381
I never do what a father should do

644
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,318
Never pay any attention to you two

645
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:26,417
That's all my fault

646
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:29,049
I'm wrong, I'm useless, I'm no good

647
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:29,990
I should not go to Nanyang

648
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:31,561
to take up that miserable job

649
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,153
And let you two eat nothing but bean curds

650
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:36,228
Now...who should I blame?

651
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:38,262
My daughters don't want me as their father

652
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:40,265
I should not stay here anymore

653
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:41,969
This is not funny

654
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:44,974
Don't stop me, I want to leave

655
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:46,942
Uncle Bill

656
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:47,841
I am leaving now

657
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:48,840
How about us?

658
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:50,414
I said don't stop me

659
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:52,409
You know my heart is soft

660
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,745
If you stop me, I won't leave

661
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:55,547
I have to go

662
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:57,783
After I go,

663
00:30:57,889 --> 00:30:59,322
don't know when I can be back!

664
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:02,821
I am really leaving

665
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:07,696
I have to go

666
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:16,598
Dad...

667
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:17,640
I'm still here

668
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:18,572
I forget something

669
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:22,941
Dad...my words are too harsh

670
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,309
Please don't go

671
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:26,975
Go? Go where?

672
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:32,147
Okay...

673
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:33,884
Now this is a real family reunion

674
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:35,084
We can enjoy a good meal together

675
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:36,660
And go to bed early after dinner

676
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:38,388
Right, now we are a family again

677
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,155
So help yourself

678
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:39,958
Dad

679
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,467
You two brats are not my family

680
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:51,974
Uncle Bill

681
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:52,940
I'm not your uncle

682
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:54,671
I can give you food, but no shelter

683
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:55,370
If you two stay here

684
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,913
I cannot go to sleep

685
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:57,572
Then we will...

686
00:31:57,682 --> 00:31:59,616
Go back to the hotel after dinner

687
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:02,748
Go back to the hotel

688
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,309
How come you two are so early?

689
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,785
We...

690
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:11,980
Come in first

691
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:17,424
Good morning, Uncle Bill

692
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:18,324
Morning...

693
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:20,829
We don't feel well

694
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:21,864
Didn't have a good sleep?

695
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:22,762
No...

696
00:33:22,867 --> 00:33:24,357
It's real sickness

697
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:24,833
Right

698
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:25,800
Feeling sick?

699
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,300
The pulse is normal

700
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:31,340
You don't have any sickness

701
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:34,337
My purse is empty

702
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:36,375
You are sick too?

703
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:39,211
I'm desperate for money

704
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:43,118
Everybody has this kind of sickness

705
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:43,915
You won't die

706
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,150
Go and wait for me at the teahouse

707
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:49,419
Okay...will order tea and wait for you there

708
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:50,186
Let's go

709
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:56,895
Uncle Bill, it's full house

710
00:33:57,735 --> 00:33:58,463
Full house

711
00:33:58,569 --> 00:33:59,399
There's a seat over there

712
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:01,196
The prison has seats

713
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,370
Ready for you guys

714
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,374
So we meet again

715
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:10,447
There's really a connection between us

716
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,072
Stop playing dumb

717
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:13,548
I've checked out

718
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:14,777
all the big names you mentioned

719
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,353
They're all actors

720
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:17,887
Don't be too serious

721
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:19,547
Life is just like acting

722
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:20,817
Yes, Captain

723
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:22,222
Life is a stage

724
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:23,588
A stage is life

725
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:24,718
You're right

726
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:26,763
So you three go back to jail with me

727
00:34:26,864 --> 00:34:28,024
and start playing inmates

728
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:34,569
Do you want me to lock you or you do it yourself?

729
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:39,806
Uncle Bill, this is horrible

730
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,105
Pick one yourself

731
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:42,308
Brother Wai

732
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:46,014
Why do you have so many handcuffs?

733
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:47,781
They are for the thieves

734
00:34:47,885 --> 00:34:48,749
For thieves

735
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,981
Dad, do we have thieves here?

736
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:55,359
What? He's your father?

737
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,121
You don't call a stranger Dad

738
00:34:58,362 --> 00:34:59,556
Brother Wai, how many thieves are here?

739
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:01,596
Three

740
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:03,997
Three, that many

741
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:04,796
Where are they?

742
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:06,068
Where are they?

743
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:07,795
I let them go

744
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:09,998
Really? You let them go

745
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:12,639
I pity them

746
00:35:12,743 --> 00:35:14,540
So I let them go and start a new life

747
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:16,708
That's very kind of you

748
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:19,783
And you are very intelligent and understanding

749
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:20,851
Very good

750
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:22,412
Very smart

751
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:24,483
I really appreciate you

752
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:26,250
Old sir, we both understand this

753
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:27,221
Of course

754
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:29,583
I will never...

755
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:30,752
pick pockets again

756
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:31,453
Reporting!

757
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,255
Captain, there's an emergency

758
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:35,195
The Chief asks you to go back now

759
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:36,823
Old sir

760
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:37,730
Okay...

761
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:39,530
I'll take care of myself

762
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:40,535
Don't worry

763
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:41,195
No problem

764
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,603
Right, go to do your work first

765
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:46,302
Come and have a chat with my dad some other time

766
00:35:47,111 --> 00:35:47,577
Let's go

767
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:48,406
Yes

768
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,807
Uncle Bill, now we...

769
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:56,345
Have no sickness anymore

770
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:57,512
I have

771
00:35:57,622 --> 00:35:58,247
Take the clothes

772
00:35:59,390 --> 00:35:59,788
Take the clothes

773
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:00,550
I

774
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,558
Uncle Bill, you go first...

775
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:05,358
Chief

776
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:07,328
Is there an emergency case?

777
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:09,656
Recently we've found drug dealers

778
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:11,530
in several neighbouring cities

779
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:12,898
According to our information

780
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:16,064
The headquarters might be in our county

781
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:17,304
Our county

782
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:18,466
Right

783
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:21,810
You leave us alone now

784
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:22,538
Yes

785
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:29,443
This is the information from our seniors

786
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:30,213
You have a look

787
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:40,991
The dealers are related to the Fengyue Society

788
00:36:41,098 --> 00:36:42,998
It is related to Fengyue Society

789
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,294
Go to investigate now

790
00:36:44,802 --> 00:36:48,033
But Chairman Lee of the Society is your cousin

791
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:50,069
If I got hard evidence

792
00:36:50,174 --> 00:36:51,801
I'll arrest my relatives in accord with the law

793
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:52,603
Yes, sir

794
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:41,755
Boss...

795
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:45,025
That's a good fight

796
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:47,694
Thank you, Boss

797
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:48,924
What?

798
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:50,800
Do you want to fight with me?

799
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:53,532
You go first

800
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:09,313
Madam

801
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,148
Go and get some rest first

802
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:11,846
Yes

803
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:18,626
Why are you so late?

804
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:22,294
If I didn't come, you wouldn't miss me, right?

805
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,968
Darling, I always miss you

806
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:26,826
According to Sunzi's theory

807
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:28,632
There are thirty-six strategies

808
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:30,735
Strategy within strategy, strategy upon strategy

809
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:33,503
But all strategies are in fact one strategy

810
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:36,041
What strategy?

811
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,187
Play on one's psychology

812
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,923
Play on one's psychology?

813
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:48,950
That's right

814
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,152
We share a common psychology

815
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:51,387
And psychology works the same way

816
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:53,986
In a way, it's guessing what people think

817
00:38:54,098 --> 00:38:54,860
Uncle Bill

818
00:38:54,965 --> 00:38:56,432
First we've to understand how psychology works

819
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:57,694
If we were caught

820
00:38:57,802 --> 00:38:59,861
psychology cannot help

821
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:01,267
It helps

822
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:03,470
I am psychologically well prepared, right?

823
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:04,097
And how is that?

824
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:05,436
Don't let people slap your face

825
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:07,172
I'm not ready yet

826
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:08,404
You slap me first

827
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:09,501
Shut up

828
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:10,472
This is outrageous!

829
00:39:10,581 --> 00:39:11,479
In our trade

830
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:13,777
You have to be agile and smart

831
00:39:13,884 --> 00:39:14,407
Use your brain

832
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:15,849
Remember the formula:

833
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:17,580
Look around all directions

834
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:19,713
Make decisions promptly to solve problems

835
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:22,616
Uncle Bill, I understand

836
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:23,489
He understands

837
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:32,766
Hey, pal

838
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,565
Have you ever seen such a big bird?

839
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:36,907
No, eh?

840
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:38,297
Look at it

841
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:41,139
It can fight, it can sing

842
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:42,940
It can even stay here and not fly away

843
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:45,315
Oh, it flies away

844
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:46,348
My bird flies away

845
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:47,280
My bird has gone

846
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,079
My bird

847
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,109
Catch a goat with two fingers

848
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:52,285
I've learned everything

849
00:39:53,824 --> 00:39:54,483
What do you think?

850
00:39:57,261 --> 00:39:58,523
Don't push me to the limits

851
00:39:58,629 --> 00:39:59,493
You don't know your limits

852
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:03,229
See what more tricks you get?

853
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:06,167
See, there's one

854
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:09,730
Sir, please forgive me

855
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,637
I know I'm wrong, I deserve death

856
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,141
But I don't want to die

857
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,677
So I slap myself instead

858
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:16,508
I'm a normal person I should not be in this trade

859
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:19,048
Now I am going to get some honest work

860
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:21,448
That's really touching

861
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:24,282
Uncle Bill, now you're moved

862
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:25,616
You're crazy

863
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:27,088
You hit me

864
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:28,021
Not only I want to hit you

865
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:29,183
The bystanders also want to hit you

866
00:40:29,293 --> 00:40:29,952
Stupid ass

867
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:32,761
Uncle Bill...

868
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:33,921
We're both stupid

869
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:35,555
Not as smart as you

870
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:36,792
That's true

871
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:39,800
Don't think all people are fools

872
00:40:39,904 --> 00:40:41,337
Uncle Bill, what do we have to do?

873
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:41,996
Right

874
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,300
Learn from the beginning

875
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:44,806
From the beginning

876
00:40:46,076 --> 00:40:47,373
I am a fast finger

877
00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:48,240
Sir

878
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:49,277
What?

879
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:52,712
I love stealing

880
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:56,615
And won't let you know I'm in love with you

881
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,778
I'm sorry

882
00:40:57,888 --> 00:41:00,857
Don't want you to get angry with me

883
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:04,693
You never show any concern towards me!

884
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:09,332
Father, thank you

885
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:13,103
You are the only one I want

886
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:17,038
Running around you

887
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,574
I am running around you

888
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:21,076
Just want to hold you tight

889
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:24,944
Now in my dream

890
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:26,607
You don't speak a word

891
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:28,947
And I don't speak a word

892
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:33,387
Only if you want to be with me

893
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:36,426
You can have everything I love

894
00:41:37,361 --> 00:41:40,023
I love stealing

895
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:44,757
Today I want to steal you

896
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:48,737
I am running around you

897
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:03,647
Excuse me, excuse me

898
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:08,524
I am running around just want to hold you tight

899
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:11,754
Now in my dream

900
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:14,190
You don't speak a word

901
00:42:14,298 --> 00:42:16,391
I don't speak a word

902
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:20,960
Just want to walk with you everyday

903
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:23,835
You can have everything I love

904
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:27,800
I love stealing

905
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:32,238
Today I want to steal you

906
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:39,016
I am running around you...

907
00:42:39,123 --> 00:42:40,112
Let's go watch a movie

908
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:40,849
What movie?

909
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:42,084
Chase under the Moonlight

910
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:45,059
Ah, one runs away and the other chases

911
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:47,295
Hey, don't run

912
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:49,765
I'll get you

913
00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:52,199
Kid, you can't run away

914
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:53,861
Okay, I'll let you run

915
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:54,733
Still want to run?

916
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:56,897
I'm sorry

917
00:42:57,007 --> 00:42:58,269
Run

918
00:42:58,375 --> 00:42:59,899
You can't run away

919
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:02,240
Kid, now you get caught

920
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:03,973
See where you want to run?

921
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:04,877
Still want to run?

922
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:06,813
I've got him, let me go...

923
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:07,884
I've got him

924
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,778
This must be yours

925
00:43:10,888 --> 00:43:12,014
You can keep it

926
00:43:12,656 --> 00:43:13,384
Let's go

927
00:43:21,298 --> 00:43:22,925
Sir, Big Bro, Uncle, Master

928
00:43:23,033 --> 00:43:23,658
You have a kind heart

929
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:26,031
Please forgive us this time...

930
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:28,768
We've done the wrong thing

931
00:43:28,872 --> 00:43:29,702
We're mean

932
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:30,831
We're shameless

933
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:32,738
We should not do such things

934
00:43:32,843 --> 00:43:34,538
We have hands and feet

935
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:36,340
So we have to run now

936
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:43,350
Excuse me

937
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:54,829
No need to excuse

938
00:43:54,932 --> 00:43:56,024
Let's go that way

939
00:43:59,203 --> 00:43:59,931
What a coincidence!

940
00:44:00,037 --> 00:44:01,004
We meet again

941
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:02,765
It's a coincidence

942
00:44:02,873 --> 00:44:03,635
A coincidence

943
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:02,558
Shit, we meet again

944
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:03,457
One more

945
00:45:14,645 --> 00:45:15,475
Lucky I didn't fall

946
00:45:23,787 --> 00:45:24,481
Get them

947
00:45:25,689 --> 00:45:26,417
Wait for me

948
00:45:34,131 --> 00:45:34,893
Chase

949
00:48:49,526 --> 00:48:51,687
Still want to fight?

950
00:49:09,346 --> 00:49:11,814
I jump...

951
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:20,917
I jump...

952
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:34,894
One, two, three

953
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:38,337
Please

954
00:49:57,127 --> 00:49:58,526
Bye bye

955
00:50:37,601 --> 00:50:38,693
You steal my purse

956
00:50:40,637 --> 00:50:43,071
You...steal...

957
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:44,640
I hit you because you steal my purse

958
00:50:44,741 --> 00:50:46,470
Hey, who steals your purse?

959
00:50:46,576 --> 00:50:48,339
He steals my purse...

960
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:52,015
Pal, why you steal his purse?

961
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:54,910
Do I look like a thief?

962
00:50:55,018 --> 00:50:57,418
Not really, then he must be the one

963
00:50:57,521 --> 00:50:59,182
You...

964
00:50:59,856 --> 00:51:01,016
He accuses you of stealing his purse

965
00:51:01,124 --> 00:51:01,920
I stole his purse?!

966
00:51:02,025 --> 00:51:03,458
When did I steal his purse?

967
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,721
Tell me when did I steal his purse

968
00:51:06,363 --> 00:51:07,227
Hey, when did I steal your purse?

969
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:07,989
Something's going wrong with Uncle Bill

970
00:51:08,098 --> 00:51:09,156
Cut the crap and help out

971
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:12,363
When did I steal your purse, huh?

972
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:13,561
Pal, tell me

973
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:14,193
He said I stole his purse

974
00:51:14,304 --> 00:51:14,861
Do I look like a thief?

975
00:51:14,971 --> 00:51:15,869
No

976
00:51:15,972 --> 00:51:17,132
Why do you accuse me of stealing your purse?

977
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:19,936
Pal, did you steal his purse?

978
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:21,840
I really haven't stolen his purse

979
00:51:21,945 --> 00:51:23,344
Not really

980
00:51:23,447 --> 00:51:24,607
I can prove you haven't stolen a thing

981
00:51:24,714 --> 00:51:25,840
We can prove

982
00:51:25,949 --> 00:51:27,712
You can't just leave

983
00:51:28,118 --> 00:51:29,176
Let's go

984
00:51:34,024 --> 00:51:34,820
Let's go

985
00:51:42,165 --> 00:51:42,961
Get up

986
00:51:46,803 --> 00:51:48,737
Now do I look like a pick pocket?

987
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:50,773
No...

988
00:51:50,874 --> 00:51:52,341
It's a mistake...

989
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:57,906
Please come in, welcome

990
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:01,546
Please

991
00:52:01,852 --> 00:52:05,253
Sir, welcome. Please come in

992
00:52:05,355 --> 00:52:07,585
Welcome...

993
00:52:09,226 --> 00:52:11,194
Sir, please

994
00:52:18,568 --> 00:52:20,331
Welcome, please come in...

995
00:52:22,172 --> 00:52:22,536
Welcome

996
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:45,794
Now I realize life is beautiful

997
00:52:45,896 --> 00:52:47,454
That's because you haven't experienced much

998
00:52:47,564 --> 00:52:48,223
I...

999
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:49,328
Let's go

1000
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:11,320
Remember, don't just take small advantages

1001
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:12,820
Don't try to grab a little only to lose a lot

1002
00:53:12,923 --> 00:53:13,787
Of course

1003
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:14,879
Will make the little into big ones

1004
00:53:18,662 --> 00:53:19,890
I'm gonna bet on big

1005
00:53:19,996 --> 00:53:21,190
Last 6 times it's already opened "big"

1006
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,535
Uncle Bill, I want to look around over there

1007
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:00,460
Miss

1008
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:03,266
Are you the TV star Chen Xiumei?

1009
00:54:03,673 --> 00:54:04,697
I'm Lin Xiumei

1010
00:54:04,808 --> 00:54:05,604
Such a beautiful lady

1011
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:06,676
She should be Chen Xiumei

1012
00:54:06,776 --> 00:54:08,209
I'm pretty sure of this

1013
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:21,923
Damn

1014
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:36,336
So inconsiderate

1015
00:54:47,684 --> 00:54:48,548
What are you laughing at?

1016
00:54:48,652 --> 00:54:49,676
Why are you laughing?

1017
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:51,014
Are you done laughing?

1018
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:52,383
What's so funny?

1019
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:53,478
You're still laughing

1020
00:54:54,391 --> 00:54:55,915
Laughing is an art

1021
00:54:56,026 --> 00:54:57,152
Your style of flirting with girls

1022
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:58,693
is really very funny

1023
00:54:58,995 --> 00:55:00,826
So you're an expert at courtship or what?

1024
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:01,760
Sure

1025
00:55:02,365 --> 00:55:04,765
Better not talk too much

1026
00:55:04,868 --> 00:55:05,698
Remember

1027
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:08,293
Smile, a bigger smile, laugh

1028
00:55:08,405 --> 00:55:10,305
Then you can have every girl you want

1029
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,364
Sounds too simple

1030
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:13,407
You don't believe me, right?

1031
00:55:14,678 --> 00:55:16,145
There's a girl over there

1032
00:55:19,683 --> 00:55:20,206
Very pretty

1033
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:21,113
Right

1034
00:55:21,718 --> 00:55:22,980
Then learn from me

1035
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:29,386
How?

1036
00:55:30,593 --> 00:55:31,617
Don't be too pushy

1037
00:55:31,728 --> 00:55:32,592
One step at a time

1038
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:43,403
Keep smiling

1039
00:56:06,596 --> 00:56:18,406
Smile, a bigger smile,

1040
00:56:18,508 --> 00:56:19,497
Laugh

1041
00:56:23,513 --> 00:56:24,411
I've done it!

1042
00:56:27,617 --> 00:56:30,177
What's going on...?

1043
00:56:30,286 --> 00:56:31,048
A funeral

1044
00:56:31,154 --> 00:56:31,586
Who's that?

1045
00:56:31,688 --> 00:56:32,450
It's you

1046
00:56:33,022 --> 00:56:33,989
Help!

1047
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:35,990
You bloody kid, see what you've done to me

1048
00:56:36,092 --> 00:56:36,683
Bye bye

1049
00:56:36,793 --> 00:56:38,055
Blackjack, win all

1050
00:56:38,428 --> 00:56:40,055
Hey, I quit...let's go...

1051
00:56:41,498 --> 00:56:44,023
I win again...

1052
00:56:44,134 --> 00:56:46,602
Give it to me...win again

1053
00:56:50,673 --> 00:56:51,503
Bet on the big

1054
00:56:55,378 --> 00:56:56,640
Uncle Bill, sit down

1055
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:57,770
I'll be back soon

1056
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:03,686
What the hell!

1057
00:57:09,826 --> 00:57:11,691
You seem back from Nanyang?

1058
00:57:12,962 --> 00:57:13,485
Right

1059
00:57:14,464 --> 00:57:17,865
Heard that you have a rubber plantation, right?

1060
00:57:18,968 --> 00:57:19,559
No

1061
00:57:20,203 --> 00:57:21,227
No?

1062
00:57:23,506 --> 00:57:23,938
Then your father

1063
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:26,668
must be a...Chief Commander

1064
00:57:27,677 --> 00:57:28,939
No

1065
00:57:29,045 --> 00:57:30,979
And your son must know how to print banknotes

1066
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:32,172
Do you print US banknotes?

1067
00:57:33,049 --> 00:57:34,846
Printing banknotes? No

1068
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:36,047
You have nothing great or powerful

1069
00:57:36,152 --> 00:57:37,380
Then why are you so bold?

1070
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:40,582
I have some guts, so what?

1071
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:41,486
It's outrageous

1072
00:57:41,591 --> 00:57:42,387
This chair is mine

1073
00:57:42,492 --> 00:57:43,789
What's wrong...?

1074
00:57:43,893 --> 00:57:45,224
Keep going...

1075
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:47,426
You can have my seat

1076
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:48,963
This is a lucky seat, you take it

1077
00:57:49,065 --> 00:57:49,895
I'm lucky too

1078
00:57:52,836 --> 00:57:54,303
It's not that easy to lose

1079
00:57:54,604 --> 00:57:56,367
But I do have money

1080
00:57:57,106 --> 00:57:58,835
It's like throwing sand into the ocean

1081
00:58:00,076 --> 00:58:02,101
Save your money for medicine

1082
00:58:03,379 --> 00:58:06,348
Oh, this is all I've left

1083
00:58:13,923 --> 00:58:14,685
Place your bet

1084
00:58:16,593 --> 00:58:17,992
Sir, please place your bet

1085
00:58:31,774 --> 00:58:33,139
Haven't seen the Ace yet?

1086
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:34,574
Can I separate these two cards?

1087
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:35,200
No

1088
00:58:35,311 --> 00:58:36,835
It's not a pair so you can't separate them

1089
00:58:36,946 --> 00:58:38,379
But he can do that

1090
00:58:38,948 --> 00:58:40,176
Can I separate them?

1091
00:58:40,283 --> 00:58:41,614
Then I'll separate them

1092
00:58:41,718 --> 00:58:43,481
It's 20 points and you still want to separate?

1093
00:58:46,823 --> 00:58:47,915
Good luck to him

1094
00:58:48,658 --> 00:58:51,183
See, I win big money with just a small bet

1095
00:58:54,397 --> 00:58:55,989
Don't be cocky, now I made a bigger bet

1096
00:58:57,967 --> 00:58:58,524
Deal

1097
00:59:03,306 --> 00:59:04,295
I've told you

1098
00:59:04,407 --> 00:59:05,999
It's like throwing sand into the ocean

1099
00:59:09,412 --> 00:59:10,743
The dealer has 18 points

1100
00:59:10,847 --> 00:59:11,575
Everyone wins

1101
00:59:11,681 --> 00:59:12,875
Except this gentleman who raised his bet

1102
00:59:28,264 --> 00:59:30,630
Do you still want to gamble?

1103
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:32,657
Gambling is just like embroidery

1104
00:59:32,769 --> 00:59:33,997
You should not rush

1105
00:59:34,103 --> 00:59:35,070
If I gambled like you

1106
00:59:35,171 --> 00:59:36,502
I would lose everything in no time

1107
00:59:36,606 --> 00:59:37,698
Go to hell

1108
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:39,935
Stop talking

1109
00:59:40,043 --> 00:59:41,476
Place your bet...

1110
00:59:41,844 --> 00:59:42,833
Okay, I'll make a bet

1111
01:00:24,821 --> 01:00:28,052
Hey, brother

1112
01:00:28,157 --> 01:00:30,648
These girls are good at dancing

1113
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:31,727
They are the best

1114
01:00:32,695 --> 01:00:33,923
That girl on the right

1115
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:36,555
Her body is sexy and she's hot

1116
01:00:36,666 --> 01:00:38,361
If she went to bed with me for one night

1117
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:39,526
I would die for this chance

1118
01:00:40,703 --> 01:00:42,102
That's my daughter

1119
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:44,536
I mean the one next to her

1120
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:47,135
That is my wife's daughter's sister

1121
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:51,204
I mean the one next to the next one

1122
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:52,440
No more next

1123
01:00:52,548 --> 01:00:53,242
Do you know

1124
01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:54,680
who is sitting next to you?

1125
01:00:55,418 --> 01:00:56,976
I don't know

1126
01:00:57,086 --> 01:00:59,077
I am the father of those five girls

1127
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:03,049
I'm sorry

1128
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:04,057
I'll buy you a drink

1129
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:05,327
Let's watch the show

1130
01:01:35,825 --> 01:01:38,419
Look...People are looking up to me.

1131
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:41,326
They're looking at my glamour.

1132
01:01:41,431 --> 01:01:43,797
My body is glittering...

1133
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:46,368
like many rockets crashing through.

1134
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:49,831
Applause...People are applauding.

1135
01:01:49,939 --> 01:01:52,032
Shit, that's awful

1136
01:01:52,809 --> 01:01:55,209
Dash, Dash, Dash...

1137
01:01:55,311 --> 01:01:58,075
The centre of space is trembling.

1138
01:01:58,681 --> 01:02:02,310
I feel as if I'm riding a platinum elevator...

1139
01:02:02,418 --> 01:02:05,012
That singer has such a big mouth

1140
01:02:05,855 --> 01:02:07,413
Big mouth is okay

1141
01:02:07,523 --> 01:02:08,956
If she has a gentle heart

1142
01:02:09,258 --> 01:02:10,987
Big mouth ruins everything

1143
01:02:11,094 --> 01:02:12,083
That's not fun

1144
01:02:12,428 --> 01:02:13,588
What do you mean?

1145
01:02:13,696 --> 01:02:15,061
Use your brain and think

1146
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:20,995
Even the earth seems fascinated and it's dancing

1147
01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:30,042
Ladies and gentlemen, next we have

1148
01:02:30,146 --> 01:02:32,979
a spectacular magic show coming up:

1149
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:34,982
An air plane out of the air

1150
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:44,184
Excuse me

1151
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:45,388
Uncle Bill, how are you doing?

1152
01:02:45,495 --> 01:02:47,156
Winning or losing?

1153
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:49,891
Uncle Bill never wins an argument

1154
01:02:49,999 --> 01:02:51,728
But when do I lose money?

1155
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:54,062
This man next to me almost lose everything

1156
01:02:54,170 --> 01:02:55,159
Losing money just like bleeding

1157
01:03:02,979 --> 01:03:03,570
Deal

1158
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:07,944
That man on the right

1159
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:08,880
is not gambling here

1160
01:03:08,985 --> 01:03:10,145
He wants to cause trouble here. Keep an eye on him

1161
01:03:10,653 --> 01:03:13,178
Do you want to increase your stakes?

1162
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:15,784
Okay...

1163
01:03:16,192 --> 01:03:16,886
Wait a sec

1164
01:03:16,993 --> 01:03:17,584
The cards are no good and you still want to

1165
01:03:17,693 --> 01:03:19,024
Sure I want to increase my stake

1166
01:03:19,128 --> 01:03:20,288
If I increase my stake

1167
01:03:20,396 --> 01:03:21,488
I could only add one extra card

1168
01:03:21,597 --> 01:03:22,461
If I didn't make a bigger bet

1169
01:03:22,565 --> 01:03:23,122
I didn't have to add an extra card

1170
01:03:23,232 --> 01:03:24,358
Just waiting for the dealer to blow me up

1171
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:25,832
If you don't, I want to

1172
01:03:25,935 --> 01:03:26,526
Deal

1173
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:37,543
Eight, nine...

1174
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:39,046
Eight, there's some hope

1175
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:41,048
A small number...

1176
01:03:42,752 --> 01:03:43,548
It blows up

1177
01:03:45,521 --> 01:03:46,317
It blows up

1178
01:03:46,422 --> 01:03:47,354
You evil spirit

1179
01:03:47,456 --> 01:03:49,048
Always picking up the wrong cards

1180
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:50,147
Now you don't pick the card

1181
01:03:50,259 --> 01:03:52,022
You know I want the big ones

1182
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:54,956
Do I blow up your points?

1183
01:03:55,264 --> 01:03:56,060
You blow up your own points...

1184
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:56,756
What's going on, pal?

1185
01:03:56,866 --> 01:03:57,332
What's going on?

1186
01:03:57,433 --> 01:03:58,127
Look at him

1187
01:03:58,234 --> 01:04:00,202
Why he doesn't pick up cards like these?

1188
01:04:00,303 --> 01:04:01,895
Why don't you pick up the cards?

1189
01:04:02,538 --> 01:04:04,233
I have too much money I don't want some more

1190
01:04:06,209 --> 01:04:07,335
Well, that's a lot of money

1191
01:04:07,443 --> 01:04:08,410
Of course

1192
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:09,478
But they're all blank paper

1193
01:04:09,745 --> 01:04:10,404
He's cheating

1194
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:11,241
Cheater

1195
01:04:50,486 --> 01:04:51,510
No entry

1196
01:04:59,028 --> 01:05:00,154
Stop for a while

1197
01:05:00,263 --> 01:05:01,252
I want to tell you something

1198
01:05:02,698 --> 01:05:03,392
What?

1199
01:05:03,866 --> 01:05:05,493
It's serious business

1200
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:07,668
What serious business?

1201
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:09,868
Do you want to listen or not?

1202
01:05:10,806 --> 01:05:11,602
Go ahead

1203
01:05:12,375 --> 01:05:14,570
I overheard the old guy talking to Captain Tie today

1204
01:05:14,677 --> 01:05:15,507
that tomorrow they would go to

1205
01:05:15,611 --> 01:05:17,272
Huaguo Hotel to have a meeting

1206
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:18,745
What kind of meeting?

1207
01:05:18,848 --> 01:05:20,406
It's about your opium trade

1208
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:24,551
Seems they are quite sure who's the boss

1209
01:05:24,654 --> 01:05:25,814
So what should we do now?

1210
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:26,752
What should I do?

1211
01:05:26,856 --> 01:05:28,153
It's better to get rid of him

1212
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:29,622
I have to make a quick move

1213
01:05:29,725 --> 01:05:30,817
And find someone to kill him

1214
01:05:31,227 --> 01:05:32,717
Dragon, are you sure about this?

1215
01:05:32,828 --> 01:05:33,590
Sure

1216
01:05:33,696 --> 01:05:34,924
This is a perfect move

1217
01:05:48,678 --> 01:05:50,077
Uncle Bill, why start a fight?

1218
01:05:50,179 --> 01:05:51,009
Don't ask, go quick

1219
01:06:02,425 --> 01:06:03,119
It's red, it's green

1220
01:07:09,825 --> 01:07:11,258
My back is broken

1221
01:07:58,507 --> 01:08:00,065
Hey, enough. Let's go

1222
01:08:06,515 --> 01:08:07,482
After them...

1223
01:08:11,153 --> 01:08:11,551
Brother Wai

1224
01:08:11,654 --> 01:08:13,781
When will you come back?

1225
01:08:13,889 --> 01:08:15,254
After five or six days

1226
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:17,024
Have you finished yet?

1227
01:08:18,461 --> 01:08:20,622
A big guy like you, just keep talking

1228
01:08:22,298 --> 01:08:23,128
Too much sweet-talk

1229
01:08:23,232 --> 01:08:24,199
Xiao Ji...

1230
01:08:25,701 --> 01:08:27,726
Xiao Ji, when I come back

1231
01:08:27,837 --> 01:08:29,930
I'll give you two bottles of perfume

1232
01:08:30,739 --> 01:08:33,173
Okay, I believe you one more time

1233
01:08:33,275 --> 01:08:35,835
Don't think you can buy with some perfume

1234
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:38,277
If you didn't keep your promise

1235
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:39,642
I would tell Dad

1236
01:08:39,748 --> 01:08:41,147
about you two

1237
01:08:41,917 --> 01:08:43,782
What are you talking about me?

1238
01:08:43,886 --> 01:08:45,183
Dad...

1239
01:08:45,287 --> 01:08:45,776
Uncle Bill

1240
01:08:45,888 --> 01:08:47,822
No wonder I have a hunch today

1241
01:08:47,923 --> 01:08:49,185
Dad...you

1242
01:08:50,092 --> 01:08:50,820
Don't talk about it

1243
01:08:51,193 --> 01:08:52,524
It's tough to be a nice person

1244
01:08:52,628 --> 01:08:53,754
Uncle Bill, you are going to...

1245
01:08:53,863 --> 01:08:55,831
Where...to go?

1246
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:00,625
You came here when I went out

1247
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:03,332
It's late and you still don't want to leave

1248
01:09:04,306 --> 01:09:06,900
Right...It's late now

1249
01:09:07,009 --> 01:09:09,136
Go home and go to bed, right, Dad?

1250
01:09:09,245 --> 01:09:09,904
Yes, Uncle Bill

1251
01:09:10,012 --> 01:09:10,808
I have to go now

1252
01:09:13,549 --> 01:09:15,244
Dad, it's tasty

1253
01:09:15,351 --> 01:09:17,216
Oh dear, look at you...

1254
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:18,217
Even if I offer a big dowry

1255
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:19,617
No one is willing to marry you

1256
01:09:19,722 --> 01:09:20,654
Stop eating now

1257
01:09:22,925 --> 01:09:24,153
You have nothing like me

1258
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:26,251
Except your pompous look

1259
01:09:26,362 --> 01:09:26,987
You're right, Dad

1260
01:09:27,096 --> 01:09:27,687
Looks perfectly like you

1261
01:09:27,796 --> 01:09:28,626
Right?

1262
01:09:29,798 --> 01:09:30,696
Go to bed early tonight

1263
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:32,790
We have things to do tomorrow morning, okay?

1264
01:09:32,902 --> 01:09:34,494
Right, go to bed early

1265
01:09:34,603 --> 01:09:35,433
Wash your hands before you go to bed

1266
01:09:43,546 --> 01:09:45,013
It's in the genes, I can't help it

1267
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:49,484
"Huaguo Hotel"

1268
01:10:02,965 --> 01:10:03,488
I have a meeting up there

1269
01:10:03,599 --> 01:10:04,122
You guys wait here

1270
01:10:04,233 --> 01:10:04,858
Yes

1271
01:10:10,773 --> 01:10:11,831
Thank you, I can take this by myself

1272
01:10:15,144 --> 01:10:16,133
Go and talk to him

1273
01:10:16,245 --> 01:10:18,236
Uncle Bill...

1274
01:10:18,347 --> 01:10:19,211
Why come so early?

1275
01:10:19,315 --> 01:10:21,749
Uncle Bill, we want to...

1276
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:23,078
Buy some bean curd

1277
01:10:25,554 --> 01:10:26,521
Yuan

1278
01:10:26,622 --> 01:10:29,921
Selling bean curd is a tough job

1279
01:10:30,025 --> 01:10:30,992
Let me help you

1280
01:10:31,093 --> 01:10:32,390
I don't need your help

1281
01:10:32,494 --> 01:10:33,392
Yuan, let me help you

1282
01:10:34,663 --> 01:10:35,391
I don't need that

1283
01:10:35,497 --> 01:10:37,488
I can help...Fat Ass

1284
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:38,828
You would help?

1285
01:10:40,035 --> 01:10:42,629
You two stop showing off here

1286
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:44,069
Just waste your energy

1287
01:10:44,173 --> 01:10:44,867
Xiao Ji

1288
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:47,175
Don't be partial to them

1289
01:10:47,276 --> 01:10:49,005
When Brother Wai comes back from the town

1290
01:10:49,111 --> 01:10:50,635
He'll teach you a good lesson

1291
01:10:50,946 --> 01:10:52,345
Does Brother Wai go to town?

1292
01:10:52,448 --> 01:10:54,040
Yes, he has work to do there

1293
01:10:54,149 --> 01:10:55,446
He goes with the Chief

1294
01:10:55,851 --> 01:10:57,580
Now this is our big chance

1295
01:10:57,686 --> 01:10:58,675
Yuan, are you free today?

1296
01:10:58,787 --> 01:10:59,481
Let's go to see a movie

1297
01:10:59,588 --> 01:11:00,486
Shit

1298
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:03,817
What shit? It's so early

1299
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:04,915
Shit, Uncle Bill

1300
01:11:07,997 --> 01:11:09,123
Why didn't you tell me early?

1301
01:11:09,431 --> 01:11:11,160
Last night was a chaos

1302
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:12,097
How could I tell you?

1303
01:11:12,201 --> 01:11:13,065
Xiao Ji, give me the coat

1304
01:11:13,168 --> 01:11:14,192
Tell me...

1305
01:11:15,070 --> 01:11:16,196
Louder

1306
01:11:16,305 --> 01:11:16,999
Let's go

1307
01:11:17,973 --> 01:11:19,133
Dad...

1308
01:11:37,493 --> 01:11:39,188
That old guy is lucky

1309
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:41,126
Such a big bomb didn't kill him

1310
01:11:41,230 --> 01:11:43,596
He is not killed. Then what should we do?

1311
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:46,028
Don't worry

1312
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:48,933
He's not safe even in the hospital

1313
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,439
I have another plan

1314
01:13:08,617 --> 01:13:09,345
Hi

1315
01:14:06,875 --> 01:14:09,139
Uncle Bill, you said it's a drill

1316
01:14:09,244 --> 01:14:10,711
Why do you take this for real?

1317
01:14:10,813 --> 01:14:12,838
A drill or not

1318
01:14:12,948 --> 01:14:14,779
You have to do it for real

1319
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:16,084
You act too real

1320
01:14:16,185 --> 01:14:17,152
Take a look at them

1321
01:14:17,252 --> 01:14:18,412
They're seriously beaten

1322
01:14:18,821 --> 01:14:20,448
They are lucky

1323
01:14:20,556 --> 01:14:22,183
If it's me, I have something more powerful

1324
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:23,258
You...what

1325
01:14:23,358 --> 01:14:24,416
I...

1326
01:14:25,027 --> 01:14:27,257
Okay, stop talking now

1327
01:14:27,362 --> 01:14:29,023
We have to act according to our plan

1328
01:14:34,570 --> 01:14:35,901
Where's the Chief's room?

1329
01:14:36,271 --> 01:14:37,101
The VIP room on 2nd floor

1330
01:14:37,206 --> 01:14:38,537
We are sent by our God

1331
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:40,505
To deliver gospel to the Chief

1332
01:14:40,609 --> 01:14:42,372
To save this lost lamb

1333
01:14:42,878 --> 01:14:43,708
God bless you

1334
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:45,505
You can't go upstairs

1335
01:14:45,614 --> 01:14:46,273
Whafs the matter?

1336
01:14:46,381 --> 01:14:47,507
They want to visit the Chief

1337
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:49,344
We come to save the Chief

1338
01:14:49,451 --> 01:14:50,918
Sorry, you can't go upstairs

1339
01:14:51,019 --> 01:14:52,179
But God has given the permission

1340
01:14:54,122 --> 01:14:57,956
You can't go upstairs...

1341
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:01,026
Listen to me

1342
01:15:01,129 --> 01:15:04,860
You can't go upstairs...

1343
01:15:08,837 --> 01:15:09,360
Whafs the matter?

1344
01:15:09,471 --> 01:15:10,733
Officer, they insist to visit the Chief

1345
01:15:11,406 --> 01:15:13,306
Sorry, the Chief needs some rest

1346
01:15:13,408 --> 01:15:14,500
Please go home

1347
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:15,508
My God

1348
01:15:15,844 --> 01:15:18,312
Listen, I know you are a good doctor

1349
01:15:18,413 --> 01:15:20,244
But you can only heal his body

1350
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:22,214
We come to save his soul

1351
01:15:22,317 --> 01:15:23,511
If you didn't let us in

1352
01:15:23,619 --> 01:15:24,916
Then you'd have rejected God

1353
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:26,487
First, Love the almighty God

1354
01:15:26,588 --> 01:15:29,056
Second, We have to worship God on Sundays

1355
01:15:29,157 --> 01:15:30,647
Third, Don't indulge in adultery

1356
01:15:30,759 --> 01:15:31,487
Fourth...

1357
01:15:31,593 --> 01:15:33,720
Okay, stop preaching

1358
01:15:33,829 --> 01:15:34,488
You can go inside now

1359
01:15:34,596 --> 01:15:35,563
Don't stay too long

1360
01:15:35,664 --> 01:15:36,289
Follow me

1361
01:15:37,633 --> 01:15:38,361
Open the door

1362
01:15:39,902 --> 01:15:41,733
We believe in God, not come here to preach

1363
01:15:44,306 --> 01:15:46,900
May God bless the Chief

1364
01:15:47,009 --> 01:15:48,306
Get well soon and come back to me

1365
01:15:48,410 --> 01:15:49,741
Peace on Earth

1366
01:15:49,845 --> 01:15:52,006
Lord please listen to our prayer

1367
01:15:52,114 --> 01:15:53,547
Please give your blessings

1368
01:15:53,649 --> 01:15:55,480
So prices will go down but not up

1369
01:15:55,584 --> 01:15:57,176
Lord please listen to our prayer

1370
01:15:57,619 --> 01:15:58,551
Please give your blessings

1371
01:15:58,654 --> 01:16:00,349
Police and hawkers become one family

1372
01:16:00,455 --> 01:16:02,184
Lord please listen to our prayer

1373
01:16:02,291 --> 01:16:05,124
the name of all the saints and the holy spirit

1374
01:16:05,227 --> 01:16:05,818
Amen

1375
01:16:06,528 --> 01:16:08,325
Open your hymn book and turn to page thirteen

1376
01:16:08,430 --> 01:16:10,227
That's enough...don't talk any more

1377
01:16:10,332 --> 01:16:11,663
The Chief needs a lot of rest

1378
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,160
We haven't sung our hymns yet

1379
01:16:13,268 --> 01:16:14,758
Please go outside and sing, okay?

1380
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:15,837
Thank you very much

1381
01:16:15,938 --> 01:16:16,700
Okay, we'll go out first

1382
01:16:21,143 --> 01:16:22,633
Let's try to strike a note

1383
01:16:33,355 --> 01:16:43,663
May God bless you...

1384
01:16:43,765 --> 01:16:48,327
Big mountains can be moved

1385
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:52,703
Small hills can be relocated

1386
01:16:52,808 --> 01:16:58,246
May the Blessings always be with you

1387
01:17:12,427 --> 01:17:21,062
Remember the Lord

1388
01:17:21,169 --> 01:17:26,106
May God bless you

1389
01:17:26,908 --> 01:17:36,909
May God bless you...have peace

1390
01:17:37,019 --> 01:17:44,687
May God bless you...have peace

1391
01:17:44,793 --> 01:17:45,350
Uncle Bill

1392
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:48,020
Peace...

1393
01:17:48,130 --> 01:17:52,590
Big mountains can be moved

1394
01:17:52,701 --> 01:17:56,762
Small hill can be relocated

1395
01:17:56,872 --> 01:17:59,705
Blessings never leave you

1396
01:17:59,808 --> 01:18:00,638
Uncle Bill

1397
01:18:00,742 --> 01:18:01,606
God

1398
01:18:01,710 --> 01:18:02,938
Stop shouting

1399
01:18:03,045 --> 01:18:05,445
I rather kill the innocent then let you go

1400
01:18:08,316 --> 01:18:09,408
You're vicious

1401
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:11,486
God will never forgive you

1402
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:13,751
God? I'm a Buddhist

1403
01:18:37,579 --> 01:18:38,876
What are they doing there?

1404
01:18:39,281 --> 01:18:40,305
Give blessings to the Chief

1405
01:18:40,415 --> 01:18:41,040
Blessings?

1406
01:18:55,297 --> 01:18:56,059
Are you alright?

1407
01:18:56,498 --> 01:18:57,192
Are you okay?

1408
01:18:59,801 --> 01:19:01,200
Use a girl as killer

1409
01:19:01,303 --> 01:19:02,861
Shit, that's tricky

1410
01:19:02,971 --> 01:19:05,531
Tricky...! almost get killed

1411
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:07,130
You are now in one piece

1412
01:19:07,242 --> 01:19:08,209
I'm sure you should be okay

1413
01:19:08,310 --> 01:19:09,937
Right, it must be the nuns

1414
01:19:10,045 --> 01:19:10,534
Wait

1415
01:19:10,879 --> 01:19:11,937
It's not that simple

1416
01:19:12,047 --> 01:19:12,775
Stay calm

1417
01:19:12,881 --> 01:19:14,542
Find out what they want to do next?

1418
01:19:19,621 --> 01:19:21,111
Now what should we do?

1419
01:19:21,223 --> 01:19:23,123
If this is not finished we'll get into trouble

1420
01:19:27,896 --> 01:19:29,329
Big Bro, now we are...

1421
01:19:30,499 --> 01:19:31,488
Shut up

1422
01:19:38,073 --> 01:19:39,563
Now I have the last straw

1423
01:19:39,674 --> 01:19:40,333
Whafs that?

1424
01:19:42,544 --> 01:19:43,806
Give Captain Tie an order

1425
01:19:43,912 --> 01:19:45,402
to take the old guy back home

1426
01:19:45,514 --> 01:19:46,344
Take him home?

1427
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:47,437
Don't you understand

1428
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:49,012
But...

1429
01:19:49,117 --> 01:19:50,448
Don't hesitate

1430
01:19:50,552 --> 01:19:51,314
Do it now

1431
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:16,277
Madam

1432
01:20:16,378 --> 01:20:18,676
Captain Tie, you've been working hard

1433
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:20,771
Not at all, this is my job

1434
01:20:20,882 --> 01:20:21,814
It's very late

1435
01:20:21,917 --> 01:20:24,010
You can leave with the doctor and nurse

1436
01:20:24,419 --> 01:20:26,444
Right, I'll take care of the Chief

1437
01:20:26,788 --> 01:20:28,619
And his cousin

1438
01:20:28,723 --> 01:20:30,816
has brought his men here

1439
01:20:30,926 --> 01:20:31,893
You don't have to worry

1440
01:20:33,528 --> 01:20:34,688
Okay then

1441
01:20:34,796 --> 01:20:35,694
Let's leave now

1442
01:20:35,797 --> 01:20:36,388
Let's go

1443
01:20:49,744 --> 01:20:50,540
Please

1444
01:20:51,413 --> 01:20:52,209
Madam

1445
01:20:52,314 --> 01:20:54,145
I think the Chief should be okay

1446
01:20:54,249 --> 01:20:55,409
You don't have to worry about him

1447
01:20:55,517 --> 01:20:56,245
Don't worry

1448
01:20:56,351 --> 01:20:57,113
I'll take care of him

1449
01:20:57,219 --> 01:20:58,049
Sure

1450
01:20:58,153 --> 01:20:58,915
Then I'll come back tomorrow

1451
01:21:01,990 --> 01:21:02,649
Captain

1452
01:21:05,293 --> 01:21:06,191
What's going on inside?

1453
01:21:06,294 --> 01:21:07,318
Everything goes smoothly according to the plan

1454
01:21:07,429 --> 01:21:07,793
You go back and be prepared

1455
01:21:07,896 --> 01:21:08,419
Okay

1456
01:21:09,464 --> 01:21:10,863
Captain, how about me?

1457
01:21:10,966 --> 01:21:11,591
You come with me

1458
01:21:12,133 --> 01:21:12,861
What about him?

1459
01:21:12,968 --> 01:21:13,297
He...

1460
01:21:13,401 --> 01:21:13,992
I know

1461
01:21:14,102 --> 01:21:15,228
I'll protect Uncle Bill

1462
01:21:15,604 --> 01:21:16,161
Take this

1463
01:21:22,010 --> 01:21:23,170
What drug is it?

1464
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:24,876
Don't ask

1465
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:26,641
Its effect is quick

1466
01:21:26,748 --> 01:21:28,909
Then we can accuse them

1467
01:21:29,017 --> 01:21:31,542
for poisoning the Chief

1468
01:21:31,653 --> 01:21:32,381
But...

1469
01:21:32,487 --> 01:21:33,511
It should be okay

1470
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:35,015
I'll wait outside

1471
01:21:35,757 --> 01:21:37,190
We have to take action now

1472
01:21:55,977 --> 01:21:57,444
Zhengqing, you're up

1473
01:21:58,880 --> 01:21:59,938
Don't talk

1474
01:22:00,315 --> 01:22:02,180
Listen to me

1475
01:22:02,284 --> 01:22:04,149
Doc said if you take this shot

1476
01:22:04,252 --> 01:22:05,685
You would need no more

1477
01:22:09,824 --> 01:22:10,654
You want to kill your husband

1478
01:22:11,126 --> 01:22:12,115
Who are you?

1479
01:22:12,227 --> 01:22:13,125
I'm Zhengqing

1480
01:22:13,228 --> 01:22:13,751
You're not

1481
01:22:36,117 --> 01:22:37,311
He...

1482
01:22:42,324 --> 01:22:42,949
Who are you?

1483
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:46,149
Who do I look like?

1484
01:22:48,029 --> 01:22:49,018
Get him

1485
01:22:54,736 --> 01:22:55,532
Do you want to die?

1486
01:23:00,675 --> 01:23:02,370
Young lad, you don't have to pay respects

1487
01:23:15,223 --> 01:23:15,552
Uncle Bill

1488
01:23:15,657 --> 01:23:16,089
Why are you so late?

1489
01:23:16,191 --> 01:23:16,782
Can't beat these people

1490
01:23:16,891 --> 01:23:17,949
No, I just run out of air

1491
01:23:18,059 --> 01:23:18,957
Let me help you breathe

1492
01:23:23,898 --> 01:23:25,525
Catch him, quick...

1493
01:23:28,970 --> 01:23:29,698
What are you doing here

1494
01:23:41,149 --> 01:23:41,615
Thank you

1495
01:23:41,716 --> 01:23:42,341
Don't mention it

1496
01:26:30,185 --> 01:26:31,049
How are you doing?

1497
01:26:31,152 --> 01:26:32,050
Give Cheung some help now

1498
01:26:47,435 --> 01:26:49,562
Seriously injured

1499
01:26:49,671 --> 01:26:50,228
Look at you

1500
01:26:50,338 --> 01:26:51,737
Your nose and eyes are swollen

1501
01:26:51,839 --> 01:26:52,806
Are you okay?

1502
01:26:52,907 --> 01:26:54,704
Just hurt a little

1503
01:26:55,043 --> 01:26:56,442
Not little

1504
01:26:56,778 --> 01:26:57,574
Is it serious?

1505
01:26:57,679 --> 01:26:58,873
Take a look yourself

1506
01:26:58,980 --> 01:27:00,709
Then I'm finished

1507
01:27:01,049 --> 01:27:02,641
We're all finished

1508
01:28:51,993 --> 01:28:52,618
Go up

1509
01:29:04,138 --> 01:29:04,695
Chase him

1510
01:29:12,613 --> 01:29:14,376
Uncle Bill

1511
01:29:33,267 --> 01:29:34,234
Wow, this is grand

1512
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:43,503
Uncle Bill, we've made great contribution this time

1513
01:29:43,611 --> 01:29:44,976
Do we have a reward?

1514
01:29:45,079 --> 01:29:47,104
Not only a reward, you'll have a medal

1515
01:29:47,215 --> 01:29:47,977
A medal

1516
01:29:55,890 --> 01:29:56,879
Commander...

1517
01:29:57,258 --> 01:29:58,418
Commander?

1518
01:30:00,361 --> 01:30:01,259
Commander

1519
01:30:01,362 --> 01:30:02,522
You do a good job

1520
01:30:02,630 --> 01:30:03,824
I'll give what you deserve

1521
01:30:03,931 --> 01:30:04,693
Thank you, Commander

1522
01:30:05,533 --> 01:30:06,124
These three guys...

1523
01:30:06,234 --> 01:30:07,633
They offered great help

1524
01:30:08,002 --> 01:30:09,526
I want to meet them

1525
01:30:09,637 --> 01:30:10,467
Okay, please come here

1526
01:30:11,806 --> 01:30:14,240
Commander, let me introduce

1527
01:30:14,709 --> 01:30:15,937
This is Ma Cheung

1528
01:30:16,043 --> 01:30:16,805
This is Dong Bill

1529
01:30:16,911 --> 01:30:18,003
This is Qiu Qi

1530
01:30:18,746 --> 01:30:19,735
Hi

1531
01:30:22,383 --> 01:30:23,611
They're...what are they doing?

1532
01:30:26,521 --> 01:30:27,852
Uncle Bill, please turn around

1533
01:30:27,955 --> 01:30:28,819
It's good for you

1534
01:30:29,123 --> 01:30:30,112
I don't want to show my face

1535
01:30:31,359 --> 01:30:33,293
I will scare people if I showed my face

1536
01:30:33,828 --> 01:30:34,795
You are such a fool

1537
01:30:34,896 --> 01:30:37,558
I don't have a pretty face too

1538
01:30:37,665 --> 01:30:40,293
A kind heart is the most important

1539
01:30:40,935 --> 01:30:41,594
Right

1540
01:30:42,336 --> 01:30:44,429
Our Commander treats people fairly

1541
01:30:44,539 --> 01:30:45,904
Turn around and salute to the Commander

1542
01:30:50,411 --> 01:30:51,673
Oh, it's you

1543
01:30:53,448 --> 01:30:54,107
I

1544
01:30:54,215 --> 01:30:55,978
Come and get these three guys

1545
01:30:56,083 --> 01:30:56,640
Wait

1546
01:30:57,151 --> 01:30:58,118
Uncle Bill, you...

1547
01:30:58,553 --> 01:31:00,544
I stole from him

1548
01:31:00,955 --> 01:31:01,979
Commander

1549
01:31:02,089 --> 01:31:03,249
At least they have helped us

1550
01:31:03,357 --> 01:31:04,187
Please don't be too harsh on them

1551
01:31:06,060 --> 01:31:07,584
Don't be too harsh?

1552
01:31:08,162 --> 01:31:10,824
Alright...

1553
01:31:10,932 --> 01:31:12,923
Serve three months in jail

1554
01:31:13,768 --> 01:31:15,201
Three months in jail...

1555
01:31:16,571 --> 01:31:18,129
Uncle Bill, what's it like in jail?

1556
01:31:18,239 --> 01:31:19,365
It's very comfortable

1557
01:31:19,807 --> 01:31:21,502
Uncle Bill, I've never been in jail

1558
01:31:21,609 --> 01:31:23,474
Then you should try

1559
01:31:23,578 --> 01:31:25,546
You'll get used to it

1560
01:31:25,646 --> 01:31:26,237
Let's go

1561
01:31:27,048 --> 01:31:28,572
Uncle Bill, when you were here last time

1562
01:31:28,683 --> 01:31:29,741
what was it like?

1563
01:31:29,851 --> 01:31:30,715
Right...

1564
01:31:30,818 --> 01:31:31,876
When I was here

1565
01:31:31,986 --> 01:31:33,180
A servant made my bed

1566
01:31:33,287 --> 01:31:34,481
I had meat and soup for every meal

1567
01:31:34,589 --> 01:31:36,557
Sun bathing during the day

1568
01:31:36,657 --> 01:31:38,420
Playing mahjong at night

1569
01:31:39,293 --> 01:31:42,023
Uncle Bill, it sounds very comfortable here

1570
01:31:42,129 --> 01:31:42,857
Not only that

1571
01:31:42,964 --> 01:31:44,090
They even give me a big welcome

1572
01:31:44,198 --> 01:31:45,460
Don't believe? Just yell 'Uncle Bill is back again!'

1573
01:31:46,167 --> 01:31:49,193
Okay, then I'll shout out: 'Uncle Bill is back again'

1574
01:31:56,377 --> 01:31:57,605
Uncle Bill, you're so good

1575
01:32:00,248 --> 01:32:01,545
I am running around

1576
01:32:01,649 --> 01:32:03,776
Trying to hold you tight

1577
01:32:05,620 --> 01:32:07,144
Uncle Bill, you're so smart

1578
01:32:22,003 --> 01:32:24,631
Thank you...

1579
01:32:35,483 --> 01:32:40,352
We want to change cells
