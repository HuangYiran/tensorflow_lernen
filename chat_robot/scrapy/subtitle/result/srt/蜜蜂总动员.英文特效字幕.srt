{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Never thought I'd make it.

28
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Three days grade school, three days high school.

29
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Those were awkward.

30

37
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.

38

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Can anyone work on the Krelman?

78

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know

79
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.

80
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But choose carefully

81
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:05,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.

82
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:09,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.

83
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What's the difference?

84
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:16,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off

85
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}in 27 million years.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Wow! That blew my mind!

89
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}"What's the difference? " How can you say that?

00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:54,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why would you question anything? We're bees.

94
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.

95
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:09,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?

96
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Like what? Give me one example.

97
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.

98
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:23,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.

99
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Wait a second. Check it out.

100
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:28,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! Wow.

101
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I've never seen them this close.

102
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}They know what it's like outside the hive.

103
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah, but some don't come back.

104
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hey, Jocks! Hi, Jocks!

105
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You guys did great!

106
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:17,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!

107
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:20,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I wonder where they were. I don't know.

108
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:21,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Their day's not planned.

109
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.

110
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Right.

111
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.

112
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it.

113
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:45,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.

114
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too?

115
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Distant. Distant.

116
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Look at these two.

117
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:55,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Couple of Hive Harrys. Let's have fun with them.

118
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:57,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.

119
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:00,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!

120
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:04,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!

121
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, my! I never thought I'd knock him out.

122
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What were you doing during this?

123
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Trying to alert the authorities.

124
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I can autograph that.

125
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?

126
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah. Gusty.

127
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:20,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.

128
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Six miles, huh? Barry!

129
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.

130
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Maybe I am. You are not!

131
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:30,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We're going 0900 at J-Gate.

132
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:34,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough?

133
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.

134
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:49,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hey, Honex!

135
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:52,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Dad, you surprised me.

136
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You decide what you're interested in?

137
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, there's a lot of choices. But you only get one.

138
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:01,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?

139
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Son, let me tell you about stirring.

140
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:07,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.

141
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing.

142
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You know, Dad, the more I think about it,

143
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.

144
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:19,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?

145
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.

146
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:25,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!

147
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Barry, you are so funny sometimes. I'm not trying to be funny.

148
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:32,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!

149
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're gonna be a stirrer? No one's listening to me!

150
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:37,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Wait till you see the sticks I have.

151
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:40,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!

152
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Let's open some honey and celebrate!

153
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae.

154
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:50,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!

155
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:52,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm so proud.

156
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:01,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We're starting work today! Today's the day.

157
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Come on! All the good jobs will be gone.

158
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:05,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah, right.

159
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:08,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer

160
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}front desk, hair removal...

161
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:13,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Is it still available? Hang on. Two left!

162
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:14,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}One of them's yours!

163
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Congratulations! Step to the side.

164
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What'd you get? Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow!

165
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Couple of newbies?

166
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!

167
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Make your choice.

168
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You want to go first? No, you go.

169
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, my. What's available?

170
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:35,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.

171
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:39,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Any chance of getting the Krelman? Sure, you're on.

172
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:42,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.

173
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Wax monkey's always open.

174
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The Krelman opened up again.

175
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:48,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What happened?

176
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:52,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.

177
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.

178
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:57,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!

179
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, this is so hard!

180
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:03,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,

182
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:11,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry?

183

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze!

277
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He blinked!

278
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Spray him, Granny!

279
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What are you doing? !

280
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:21,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable.

281
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:23,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I gotta get home.

282
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:34,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Can't fly in rain.

283
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Can't fly in rain.

284
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:50,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!

285
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Ken, could you close the window please?

286
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:59,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Check out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure.

287
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:01,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You see? Folds out.

288
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.

289
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What was that?

290
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This...

291
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:14,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Drapes!

292
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That is diabolical.

293
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:21,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.

294
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What's number one? Star Wars?

295
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Nah, I don't go for that...

296
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...kind of stuff.

297
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds.

298
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:35,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.

299
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.

300
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it.

301
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I predicted global warming.

302
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:54,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me.

303
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Wait! Stop! Bee!

304
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:02,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Stand back. These are winter boots.

305
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Wait!

306
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:07,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Don't kill him!

307
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:11,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me!

308
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why does his life have less value than yours?

309
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:19,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement?

310
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:24,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling.

311
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}My brochure!

312
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}There you go, little guy.

313
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm not scared of him. It's an allergic thing.

314
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Put that on your resume brochure.

315
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}My whole face could puff up.

316
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Make it one of your special skills.

317
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:01,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Knocking someone out is also a special skill.

318
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.

319
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:09,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night? Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.

320
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You could put carob chips on there. Bye.

321
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:14,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Supposed to be less calories. Bye.

322
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I gotta say something.

323
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:25,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}She saved my life. I gotta say something.

324
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:28,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All right, here it goes.

325
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:42,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Nah.

326
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What would I say?

327
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:55,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I could really get in trouble.

328
00:22:57,170 --> 00:23:00,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human.

329
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:02,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I can't believe I'm doing this.

330
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I've got to.

331
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, I can't do it. Come on!

332
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No. Yes. No.

333
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Do it. I can't.

334
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:16,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How should I start it? "You like jazz? " No, that's no good.

335
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Here she comes! Speak, you fool!

336
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hi!

337
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm sorry.

338
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're talking. Yes, I know.

339
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:27,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're talking!

340
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm so sorry.

341
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No, it's OK. It's fine. I know I'm dreaming.

342
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:33,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But I don't recall going to bed.

343
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:37,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting.

344
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:41,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee!

345
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:45,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this,

346
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}but they were all trying to kill me.

347
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:50,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And if it wasn't for you...

348
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:52,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised.

349
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That was a little weird.

350
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm talking with a bee. Yeah.

351
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me!

352
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I just want to say I'm grateful. I'll leave now.

353
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:09,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Wait! How did you learn to do that? What?

354
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:11,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The talking thing.

355
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:15,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Same way you did, I guess. "Mama, Dada, honey." You pick it up.

356
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's very funny. Yeah.

357
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with.

358
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Anyway...

359
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:24,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Can I...

360
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...get you something? Like what?

361
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:31,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Coffee?

362
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:33,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't want to put you out.

363
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:36,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.

364
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:38,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's just coffee. I hate to impose.

365
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Don't be ridiculous! Actually, I would love a cup.

366
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hey, you want rum cake?

367
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:44,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I shouldn't. Have some.

368
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:46,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No, I can't. Come on!

369
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:48,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.

370
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Where? These stripes don't help.

371
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You look great!

372
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:54,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't know if you know anything about fashion.

373
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:55,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Are you all right?

374
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:57,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No.

375
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:03,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison.

376
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He finally gets there.

377
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:09,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He runs up the steps into the church. The wedding is on.

378
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:13,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And he says, "Watermelon? I thought you said Guatemalan.

379
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:15,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why would I marry a watermelon? "

380
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:24,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Is that a bee joke?

381
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's the kind of stuff we do.

382
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:27,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah, different.

383
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So, what are you gonna do, Barry?

384
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}About work? I don't know.

385
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:37,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I want to do my part for the hive, but I can't do it the way they want.

386
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:38,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I know how you feel.

387
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You do? Sure.

388
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:45,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.

389
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:48,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Really? My only interest is flowers.

390
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:52,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan.

391
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:55,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Anyway, if you look...

392
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:58,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}There's my hive right there. See it?

393
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're in Sheep Meadow!

394
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:03,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!

395
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once.

396
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why do girls put rings on their toes? Why not?

397
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's like putting a hat on your knee. Maybe I'll try that.

398
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You all right, ma'am? Oh, yeah. Fine.

399
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Just having two cups of coffee!

400
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:36,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Anyway, this has been great. Thanks for the coffee.

401
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:37,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah, it's no trouble.

402
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:41,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life.

403
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Are you?

404
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Can I take a piece of this with me?

405
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:49,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Sure! Here, have a crumb.

406
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Thanks! Yeah.

407
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:57,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around.

408
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:59,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Or not.

409
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:01,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}OK, Barry.

410
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:04,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And thank you so much again... for before.

411
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, that? That was nothing.

412
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:09,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...

413
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:32,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This can't possibly work.

414
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:34,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He's all set to go. We may as well try it.

415
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}OK, Dave, pull the chute.

416
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:42,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Sounds amazing. It was amazing!

417
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:45,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life.

418
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:48,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Humans! I can't believe you were with humans!

419
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:50,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Giant, scary humans! What were they like?

420
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:53,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.

421
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:55,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}They eat crazy giant things. They drive crazy.

422
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Do they try and kill you, like on TV? Some of them. But some of them don't.

423
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How'd you get back? Poodle.

424
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:05,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see.

425
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:10,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You had your "experience." Now you can pick out your job and be normal.

426
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well... Well?

427
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, I met someone.

428
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:15,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You did? Was she Bee-ish?

429
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:19,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}A wasp? ! Your parents will kill you! No, no, no, not a wasp.

430
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Spider? I'm not attracted to spiders.

431
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:24,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all.

432
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I can't get by that face.

433
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So who is she?

434
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}She's... human.

435
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:35,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law.

436
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Her name's Vanessa. Oh, boy.

437
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:41,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}She's so nice. And she's a florist!

438
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:43,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!

439
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:45,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We're not dating.

440
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:49,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're flying outside the hive, talking to humans that attack our homes

441
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite!

442
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:57,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}She saved my life! And she understands me.

443
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This is over!

444
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:00,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Eat this.

445
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:03,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This is not over! What was that?

446
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:05,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}They call it a crumb. It was so stinging' stripey!

447
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:09,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And that's not what they eat. That's what falls off what they eat!

448
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You know what a Cinnamon is? No.

449
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:14,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up...

450
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:15,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Sit down!

451
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...really hot! Listen to me!

452
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:21,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We are not them! We're us. There's us and there's them!

453
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:25,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning?

454
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:27,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me!

455
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:32,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee!

456
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:34,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Thinking bee. Thinking bee.

457
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:38,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

458
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:42,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}There he is. He's in the pool.

459
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You know what your problem is, Barry?

460
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I gotta start thinking bee?

461
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:48,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How much longer will this go on?

462
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:51,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's been three days! Why aren't you working?

463
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I've got a lot of big life decisions to think about.

464
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:59,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What life? You have no life! You have no job. You're barely a bee!

465
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Would it kill you to make a little honey?

466
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:04,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Barry, come out. Your father's talking to you.

467
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Martin, would you talk to him?

468
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:08,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Barry, I'm talking to you!

469
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:38,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You coming?

470
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Got everything?

471
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:42,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All set!

472
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:43,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Go ahead. I'll catch up.

473
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:45,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Don't be too long.

474
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Watch this!

475
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Vanessa!

476
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:20,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We're still here. I told you not to yell at him.

477
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He doesn't respond to yelling!

478
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:24,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Then why yell at me? Because you don't listen!

479
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm not listening to this.

480
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:27,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Sorry, I've gotta go.

481
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:30,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Where are you going? I'm meeting a friend.

482
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}A girl? Is this why you can't decide?

483
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:34,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Bye.

484
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:36,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I just hope she's Bee-ish.

485
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:44,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena?

486
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:48,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}To be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream!

487
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Up on a float, surrounded by flowers

488
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}crowds cheering.

489
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:56,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events?

490
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:01,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No. All right, I've got one. How come you don't fly everywhere?

491
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's faster.

492
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:07,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah, OK, I see, I see. All right, your turn.

493
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:11,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane!

494
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You don't have that?

495
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:14,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We have Hivo, but it's a disease.

496
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's a horrible, horrible disease.

497
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, my.

498
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Dumb bees!

499
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:23,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You must want to sting all those jerks.

500
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us.

501
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:29,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So you have to watch your temper.

502
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:33,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Very carefully. You kick a wall, take a walk,

503
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:37,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion:

504
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Anger, jealousy, lust.

505
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:43,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?

506
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:45,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah.

507
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:47,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What is wrong with you? ! It's a bug.

508
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:52,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He's not bothering anybody. Get out of here, you creep!

509
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?

510
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:56,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah, it was. How did you know?

511
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:00,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.

512
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:02,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You've really got that down to a science.

513
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:05,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue. I'll bet.

514
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this?

515
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:13,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How did this get here? Cute Bee, Golden Blossom,

516
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:16,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Ray Liotta Private Select?

517
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:18,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Is he that actor? I never heard of him.

518
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:21,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why is this here? For people. We eat it.

519
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:24,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You don't have enough food of your own?

520
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, yes. How do you get it?

521
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:29,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Bees make it. I know who makes it!

522
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:31,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And it's hard to make it!

523
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}There's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing!

524
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's organic. It's our-ganic!

525
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:39,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's just honey, Barry.

526
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:40,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Just what? !

527
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Bees don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing!

528
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You've taken our homes, schools, hospitals!

529
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:48,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This is all we have!

530
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:52,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And it's on sale? !

531
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm getting to the bottom of all of this!

532
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:02,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hey, Hector.

533
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You almost done? Almost.

534
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He is here. I sense it.

535
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, I guess I'll go home now

536
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:27,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around.

537
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:29,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're busted, box boy!

538
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I knew I heard something. So you can talk!

539
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:35,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I can talk. And now you'll start talking!

540
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:38,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who's your supplier?

541
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't understand. I thought we were friends.

542
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:44,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The last thing we want to do is upset bees!

543
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:47,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're too late! It's ours now!

544
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:50,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword!

545
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:53,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio!

546
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Where is the honey coming from?

547
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:59,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Tell me where!

548
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why does everything have to be so doggone clean? !

566
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How much do you people need to see? !

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Open your eyes! Stick your head out the window!

568
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}From NPR News in Washington, I'm Oarl Kasell.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You hear something? Like what?

572
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,390

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hey, Blood.

576

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Just a row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see.

577
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:34,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Wow!

578

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I assume wherever this truck goes is where they're getting it.

579
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I mean, that honey's ours.

580
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Bees hang tight. We're all jammed in.

581
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:43,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's a close community.

582
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:47,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own.

583
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:51,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What if you get in trouble? You a mosquito, you in trouble.

584
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:54,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack!

585
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}At least you're out in the world. You must meet girls.

586
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:01,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Mosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly.

587
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:04,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.

588
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You got to be kidding me!

589
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hey, guys! Moose blood!

590
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:17,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I knew I'd catch y'all down here. Did you bring your crazy straw?

591
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:38,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it's pretty much pure profit.

592
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What is this place?

593
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:42,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}A bee's got a brain the size of a pinhead.

594
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:43,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}They are pinheads!

595
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Pinhead.

596
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:50,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Check out the new smoker. Oh, sweet. That's the one you want.

597
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The Thomas 3000!

598
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:53,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Smoker?

599
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:58,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar.

600
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:02,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}A couple breaths of this knocks them right out.

601
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:08,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}They make the honey, and we make the money.

602
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}"They make the honey, and we make the money"?

603
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, my!

604
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:37,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What's going on? Are you OK?

605
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:40,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah. It doesn't last too long.

606
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:44,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Do you know you're in a fake hive with fake walls?

607
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Our queen was moved here. We had no choice.

608
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:50,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This is your queen? That's a man in women's clothes!

609
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:52,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's a drag queen!

610
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What is this?

611
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, no!

612
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}There's hundreds of them!

613
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:22,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Bee honey.

614
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:27,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale!

615
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:31,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This is worse than anything bears have done! I intend to do something.

616
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, Barry, stop.

617
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Who told you humans are taking our honey? That's a rumor.

618
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:37,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Do these look like rumors?

619
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:41,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos.

620
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:43,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How did you get mixed up in this?

621
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He's been talking to humans.

622
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What? Talking to humans? !

623
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:50,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He has a human girlfriend. And they make out!

624
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Make out? Barry!

625
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We do not.

626
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:55,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You wish you could. Whose side are you on?

627
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:56,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The bees!

628
00:40:56,550 --> 00:41:01,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me up all night.

629
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:04,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Barry, this is what you want to do with your life?

630
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:07,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder than bees!

631
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:10,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Dad, I remember you coming home so overworked

632
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}your hands were still stirring. You couldn't stop.

633
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:15,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I remember that.

634
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:17,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What right do they have to our honey?

635
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:21,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We live on two cups a year. They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!

636
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:24,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Even if it's true, what can one bee do?

637
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Sting them where it really hurts.

638
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:27,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}In the face! The eye!

639
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:29,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That would hurt. No.

640
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:30,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Up the nose? That's a killer.

641
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:35,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}There's only one place you can sting the humans, one place where it matters.

642
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:40,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hive at Five, the hive's only full-hour action news source.

643
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No more bee beards!

644
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:51,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.

648
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:02,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble. And I'm Jeanette Ohung.

649
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:05,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}A tri-county bee, Barry Benson,

650
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:08,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey,

651
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:11,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}packaging it and profiting from it illegally!

652
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:17,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King,

653
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:21,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}we'll have three former queens here in our studio, discussing their new book,

654
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:25,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Classy Ladies, out this week on Hexagon.

655
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:27,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.

656
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:31,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Did you ever think, "I'm a kid from the hive. I can't do this"?

657
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:33,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Bees have never been afraid to change the world.

658
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:37,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What about Bee Columbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?

659
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.

660
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We were thinking of stickball or candy stores.

661
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:44,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How old are you?

662
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The bee community is supporting you in this case,

663
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:50,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}which will be the trial of the bee century.

664
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:53,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You know, they have a Larry King in the human world too.

665
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:56,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's a common name. Next week...

666
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:01,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He looks like you and has a show and suspenders and colored dots...

667
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:02,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Next week...

668
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:07,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the guest even though you just heard 'em.

669
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:08,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Bear Week next week! They're scary, hairy and here live.

670
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:16,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Always leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes, very Jewish.

671
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:22,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}In tennis, you attack at the point of weakness!

672
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:26,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.

673
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:30,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Honey, her backhand's a joke! I'm not gonna take advantage of that?

674
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:33,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Quiet, please. Actual work going on here.

675
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:36,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Is that that same bee? Yes, it is!

676
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm helping him sue the human race.

677
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:42,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hello. Hello, bee.

678
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This is Ken.

679
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:48,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.

680
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:51,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why does he talk again?

681
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:54,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Listen, you better go 'cause we're really busy working.

682
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:56,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But it's our yogurt night!

683
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:57,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Bye-bye.

684
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:01,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why is yogurt night so difficult? !

685
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:06,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You poor thing. You two have been at this for hours!

686
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:08,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help.

687
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:12,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Frosting... How many sugars?

688
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Just one. I try not to use the competition.

689
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:18,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So why are you helping me?

690
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:20,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Bees have good qualities.

691
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:23,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And it takes my mind off the shop.

692
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:28,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Instead of flowers, people are giving balloon bouquets now.

693
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:30,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Those are great, if you're three.

694
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And artificial flowers.

695
00:44:32,330 --> 00:44:36,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, those just get me psychotic! Yeah, me too.

696
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:38,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Bent stingers, pointless pollination.

697
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:40,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Bees must hate those fake things!

698
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Nothing worse than a daffodil that's had work done.

699
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Maybe this could make up for it a little bit.

700
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:49,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This lawsuit's a pretty big deal. I guess.

701
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:52,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You sure you want to go through with it?

702
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:55,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Am I sure? When I'm done with the humans, they won't be able

703
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:57,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}to say, "Honey, I'm home, " without paying a royalty!

704
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:04,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan,

705
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:08,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}where the world anxiously waits, because for the first time in history,

706
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:13,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}we will hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak.

707
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:20,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What have we gotten into here, Barry?

708
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:22,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's pretty big, isn't it?

709
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:25,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I can't believe how many humans don't work during the day.

710
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:29,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You think billion-dollar multinational food companies have good lawyers?

711
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:33,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Everybody needs to stay behind the barricade.

712
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:48,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What's the matter? I don't know, I just got a chill.

713
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:57,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, if it isn't the bee team.

714
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You boys work on this?

715
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:06,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding.

716
00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:08,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All right. Case number 4475,

717
00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:13,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Superior Court of New York, Barry Bee Benson v. The Honey Industry

718
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:15,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}is now in session.

719
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:19,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Mr. Montgomery, you're representing the five food companies collectively?

720
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:21,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}A privilege.

721
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:27,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Mr. Benson... you're representing all the bees of the world?

722
00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:40,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor, we're ready to proceed.

723
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:46,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please.

724
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:51,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

725
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:54,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}my grandmother was a simple woman.

726
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:58,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Born on a farm, she believed it was man's divine right

727
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:03,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us.

728
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:08,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}If we lived in the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines,

729
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:09,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}just think of what would it mean.

730
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I would have to negotiate with the silkworm

731
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:16,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}for the elastic in my britches!

732
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:18,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Talking bee!

733
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:21,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How do we know this isn't some sort of

734
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:24,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}holographic motion-picture-capture Hollywood wizardry?

735
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:27,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}They could be using laser beams!

736
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:32,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Robotics! Ventriloquism! Cloning! For all we know,

737
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}he could be on steroids!

738
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:38,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Mr. Benson?

739
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:47,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Ladies and gentlemen, there's no trickery here.

740
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:50,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm just an ordinary bee. Honey's pretty important to me.

741
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's important to all bees. We invented it!

742
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:57,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We make it. And we protect it with our lives.

743
00:47:57,070 --> 00:47:59,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Unfortunately, there are some people in this room

744
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:01,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}who think they can take it from us

745
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:05,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}'cause we're the little guys! I'm hoping that, after this is all over,

746
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:10,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}you'll see how, by taking our honey, you not only take everything we have

747
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:12,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}but everything we are!

748
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:19,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I wish he'd dress like that all the time. So nice!

749
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:20,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Call your first witness.

750
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:25,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms, big company you have.

751
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:27,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I suppose so.

752
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:31,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I see you also own Honeyburton and Honron!

753
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:33,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yes, they provide beekeepers for our farms.

754
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:37,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Beekeeper. I find that to be a very disturbing term.

755
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:41,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't imagine you employ any bee-free-ers, do you?

756
00:48:41,610 --> 00:48:43,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No. I couldn't hear you.

757
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:44,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No. No.

758
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:48,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Because you don't free bees. You keep bees. Not only that,

759
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:53,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey.

760
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:56,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}They're very lovable creatures.

761
00:48:56,290 --> 00:48:59,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.

762
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:01,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You mean like this?

763
00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:06,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Bears kill bees!

764
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:10,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How'd you like his head crashing through your living room? !

765
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:13,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Biting into your couch! Spitting out your throw pillows!

766
00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:17,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}OK, that's enough. Take him away.

767
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:26,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me.

768
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:30,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Where have I heard it before? I was with a band called The Police.

769
00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:33,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But you've never been a police officer, have you?

770
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:34,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No, I haven't.

771
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No, you haven't. And so here we have yet another example

772
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}of bee culture casually stolen by a human

773
00:49:41,010 --> 00:49:43,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}for nothing more than a prance-about stage name.

774
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, please.

775
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:47,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?

776
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:50,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Because I'm feeling a little stung, Sting.

777
00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:54,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!

778
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:59,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's not his real name? ! You idiots!

779
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:03,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Mr. Liotta, first, belated congratulations on

780
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:06,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005.

781
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Thank you. Thank you.

782
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I see from your resume that you're devilishly handsome

783
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:16,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}with a churning inner turmoil that's ready to blow.

784
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:18,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?

785
00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:21,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Not yet it isn't. But is this what it's come to for you?

786
00:50:22,050 --> 00:50:24,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Exploiting tiny, helpless bees so you don't

787
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:28,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir?

788
00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:30,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Watch it, Benson! I could blow right now!

789
00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:34,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This isn't a goodfella. This is a badfella!

790
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:38,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why doesn't someone just step on this creep, and we can all go home? !

791
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:41,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Order in this court! You're all thinking it!

792
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:42,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Order! Order, I say!

793
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Say it! Mr. Liotta, please sit down!

794
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:54,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that.

795
00:50:54,550 --> 00:50:57,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I think the jury's on our side.

796
00:50:57,580 --> 00:51:00,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Are we doing everything right, legally?

797
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:01,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm a florist.

798
00:51:01,450 --> 00:51:05,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Right. Well, here's to a great team.

799
00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:06,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}To a great team!

800
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:10,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, hello.

801
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:12,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Ken! Hello.

802
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I didn't think you were coming.

803
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:19,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No, I was just late. I tried to call, but... the battery.

804
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:23,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I didn't want all this to go to waste, so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.

805
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:26,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, that was lucky.

806
00:51:29,110 --> 00:51:31,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}There's a little left. I could heat it up.

807
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:34,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.

808
00:51:38,290 --> 00:51:40,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So I hear you're quite a tennis player.

809
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:44,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm not much for the game myself. The ball's a little grabby.

810
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:50,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's where I usually sit. Right... there.

811
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:55,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Ken, Barry was looking at your resume,

812
00:51:55,470 --> 00:52:00,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn't really a special skill.

813
00:52:00,810 --> 00:52:03,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You think I don't see what you're doing?

814
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:07,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I know how hard it is to find the right job. We have that in common.

815
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Do we?

816
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:14,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Bees have 100 percent employment, but we do jobs like taking the crud out.

817
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:17,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's just what I was thinking about doing.

818
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:20,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz.

819
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:22,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I hope that was all right.

820
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:28,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm going to drain the old stinger.

821
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:30,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah, you do that.

822
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Look at that.

823
00:52:44,190 --> 00:52:47,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You know, I've just about had it

824
00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:50,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}with your little mind games.

825
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:53,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What's that? Italian Vogue.

826
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:54,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.

827
00:52:54,870 --> 00:52:56,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}A lot of ads.

828
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Remember what Van said, why is your life more valuable than mine?

829
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:03,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!

830
00:53:04,210 --> 00:53:07,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I think something stinks in here!

831
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:08,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I love the smell of flowers.

832
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:11,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How do you like the smell of flames? !

833
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:12,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Not as much.

834
00:53:28,630 --> 00:53:30,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Water bug! Not taking sides!

835
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:36,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Ken, I'm wearing a Chopstick hat! This is pathetic!

836
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:37,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I've got issues!

837
00:53:42,410 --> 00:53:45,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, well, well, a royal flush!

838
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're bluffing. Am I?

839
00:53:58,100 --> 00:53:59,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Surf's up, dude!

840
00:53:59,630 --> 00:54:00,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Poor water!

841
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:06,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That bowl is gnarly.

842
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:09,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Except for those dirty yellow rings!

843
00:54:09,770 --> 00:54:12,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Kenneth! What are you doing? !

844
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:15,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You know, I don't even like honey! I don't eat it!

845
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:17,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We need to talk!

846
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:19,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He's just a little bee!

847
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:24,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And he happens to be the nicest bee I've met in a long time!

848
00:54:24,790 --> 00:54:30,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Long time? What are you talking about? ! Are there other bugs in your life?

849
00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:35,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No, but there are other things bugging me in life. And you're one of them!

850
00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:38,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...

851
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:42,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}My nerves are fried from riding on this emotional roller coaster!

852
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:44,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Goodbye, Ken.

853
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:49,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And for your information,

854
00:54:50,050 --> 00:54:55,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I prefer sugar-free, artificial sweeteners made by man!

855
00:54:55,990 --> 00:54:58,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm sorry about all that.

856
00:54:58,490 --> 00:55:02,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I know it's got an aftertaste! I like it!

857
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:07,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me.

858
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I couldn't overcome it. Oh, well.

859
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:11,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Are you OK for the trial?

860
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:15,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I believe Mr. Montgomery is about out of ideas.

861
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:19,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We would like to call Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.

862
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:23,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Good idea! You can really see why he's considered one of the best lawyers...

863
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:25,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah.

864
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:29,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Layton, you've gotta weave some magic

865
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:32,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}with this jury, or it's gonna be all over.

866
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:36,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Don't worry. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around

867
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:40,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}is to remind them of what they don't like about bees.

868
00:55:40,430 --> 00:55:42,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You got the tweezers? Are you allergic?

869
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:45,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Only to losing, son. Only to losing.

870
00:55:45,870 --> 00:55:50,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you what I think we'd all like to know.

871
00:55:50,710 --> 00:55:54,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What exactly is your relationship

872
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:56,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}to that woman?

873
00:55:57,550 --> 00:55:58,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We're friends.

874
00:55:58,620 --> 00:55:59,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Good friends? Yes.

875
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:03,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How good? Do you live together?

876
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:04,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Wait a minute...

877
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:06,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Are you her little...

878
00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:08,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...bedbug?

879
00:56:09,330 --> 00:56:12,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I've seen a bee documentary or two. From what I understand,

880
00:56:12,630 --> 00:56:16,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}doesn't your queen give birth to all the bee children?

881
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:19,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah, but... So those aren't your real parents!

882
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:21,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, Barry... Yes, they are!

883
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hold me back!

884
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:25,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're an illegitimate bee, aren't you, Benson?

885
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:27,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He's denouncing bees!

886
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:29,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Don't y'all date your cousins?

887
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:32,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Objection! I'm going to pincushion this guy!

888
00:56:36,150 --> 00:56:37,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Adam, don't! It's what he wants!

889
00:56:42,930 --> 00:56:45,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, I'm hit! !

890
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:47,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, lardy, I am hit!

891
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:49,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Order! Order!

892
00:56:49,130 --> 00:56:52,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The venom! The venom is coursing through my veins!

893
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:56,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I have been felled by a winged beast of destruction!

894
00:56:56,470 --> 00:57:01,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You see? You can't treat them like equals! They're striped savages!

895
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:05,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Stinging's the only thing they know! It's their way!

896
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:08,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Adam, stay with me. I can't feel my legs.

897
00:57:09,950 --> 00:57:13,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What angel of mercy will come forward to suck the poison

898
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:15,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}from my heaving buttocks?

899
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:19,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I will have order in this court. Order!

900
00:57:19,630 --> 00:57:21,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Order, please!

901
00:57:23,130 --> 00:57:27,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The case of the honeybees versus the human race

902
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:29,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}took a pointed turn against the bees

903
00:57:29,410 --> 00:57:34,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}yesterday when one of their legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery.

904
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:49,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hey, buddy. Hey.

905
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:50,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Is there much pain? Yeah.

906
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:54,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I...

907
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:57,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I blew the whole case, didn't I?

908
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:01,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It doesn't matter. What matters is you're alive. You could have died.

909
00:58:01,170 --> 00:58:03,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'd be better off dead. Look at me.

910
00:58:04,010 --> 00:58:08,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}They got it from the cafeteria downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.

911
00:58:09,010 --> 00:58:11,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Look, there's a little celery still on it.

912
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What was it like to sting someone?

913
00:58:14,590 --> 00:58:16,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I can't explain it. It was all...

914
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:20,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All adrenaline and then... and then ecstasy!

915
00:58:23,190 --> 00:58:24,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All right.

916
00:58:24,930 --> 00:58:26,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You think it was all a trap?

917
00:58:27,030 --> 00:58:30,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Of course. I'm sorry. I flew us right into this.

918
00:58:30,330 --> 00:58:34,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What were we thinking? Look at us. We're just a couple of bugs in this world.

919
00:58:34,810 --> 00:58:37,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What will the humans do to us if they win?

920
00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:38,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't know.

921
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:41,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn't sound so bad.

922
00:58:42,050 --> 00:58:45,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Adam, they check in, but they don't check out!

923
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:47,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, my.

924
00:58:49,550 --> 00:58:52,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Could you get a nurse to close that window?

925
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:54,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why? The smoke.

926
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:55,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Bees don't smoke.

927
00:58:56,390 --> 00:58:58,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Right. Bees don't smoke.

928
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:03,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Bees don't smoke! But some bees are smoking.

929
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:06,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's it! That's our case!

930
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:08,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It is? It's not over?

931
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:10,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.

932
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:13,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Get back to the court and stall. Stall any way you can.

933
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:20,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And assuming you've done step 29 correctly, you're ready for the tub.

934
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:27,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Mr. Flayman.

935
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:29,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yes? Yes, Your Honor!

936
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:32,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Where is the rest of your team?

937
00:59:32,430 --> 00:59:34,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.

938
00:59:34,870 --> 00:59:37,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,

939
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:40,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and as a result, we don't make very good time.

940
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:43,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I actually heard a funny story about...

941
00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:45,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Your Honor, haven't these ridiculous bugs

942
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:48,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}taken up enough of this court's valuable time?

943
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:53,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How much longer will we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on?

944
00:59:53,550 --> 00:59:58,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges

945
00:59:58,090 --> 01:00:02,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}against my clients, who run legitimate businesses.

946
01:00:02,790 --> 01:00:06,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case!

947
01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:08,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going

948
01:00:08,470 --> 01:00:10,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}to have to consider Mr. Montgomery's motion.

949
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:13,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But you can't! We have a terrific case.

950
01:00:13,270 --> 01:00:15,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Where is your proof? Where is the evidence?

951
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:19,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Show me the smoking gun!

952
01:00:19,810 --> 01:00:22,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hold it, Your Honor! You want a smoking gun?

953
01:00:22,650 --> 01:00:25,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Here is your smoking gun.

954
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:29,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What is that?

955
01:00:29,690 --> 01:00:31,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's a bee smoker!

956
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:34,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What, this? This harmless little contraption?

957
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:37,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This couldn't hurt a fly, let alone a bee.

958
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Look at what has happened

959
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:50,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}to bees who have never been asked, "Smoking or non? "

960
01:00:50,410 --> 01:00:52,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Is this what nature intended for us?

961
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:55,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}To be forcibly addicted to smoke machines

962
01:00:55,510 --> 01:00:57,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and man-made wooden slat work camps?

963
01:00:58,020 --> 01:01:03,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man?

964
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:08,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What are we gonna do? He's playing the species card.

965
01:01:09,190 --> 01:01:13,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Ladies and gentlemen, please, free these bees!

966
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:15,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Free the bees! Free the bees!

967
01:01:15,970 --> 01:01:18,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Free the bees!

968
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:21,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Free the bees! Free the bees!

969
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:25,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The court finds in favor of the bees!

970
01:01:25,210 --> 01:01:26,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Vanessa, we won!

971
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:29,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I knew you could do it! High-five!

972
01:01:30,450 --> 01:01:31,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Sorry.

973
01:01:31,650 --> 01:01:34,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm OK! You know what this means?

974
01:01:35,050 --> 01:01:37,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All the honey will finally belong to the bees.

975
01:01:37,620 --> 01:01:40,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Now we won't have to work so hard all the time.

976
01:01:42,730 --> 01:01:47,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson.

977
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:49,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You'll regret this.

978
01:01:50,230 --> 01:01:52,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Barry, how much honey is out there?

979
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All right. One at a time.

980
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:56,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Barry, who are you wearing?

981
01:01:56,070 --> 01:01:58,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}My sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants.

982
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What if Montgomery's right? What do you mean?

983
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:05,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We've been living the bee way a long time, 27 million years.

984
01:02:07,950 --> 01:02:12,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Congratulations on your victory. What will you demand as a settlement?

985
01:02:12,090 --> 01:02:15,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}First, we'll demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps.

986
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:20,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Then we want back the honey that was ours to begin with,

987
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:22,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}every last drop.

988
01:02:22,570 --> 01:02:26,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more

989
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:29,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}than a filthy, smelly, bad-breath stink machine.

990
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:32,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We're all aware of what they do in the woods.

991
01:02:33,610 --> 01:02:35,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Wait for my signal.

992
01:02:36,950 --> 01:02:38,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Take him out.

993
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:43,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He'll have nauseous for a few hours, then he'll be fine.

994
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:46,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And we will no longer tolerate bee-negative nicknames...

995
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:48,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But it's just a prance-about stage name!

996
01:02:48,730 --> 01:02:52,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products

997
01:02:52,130 --> 01:02:56,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and la-dee-da human tea-time snack garnishments.

998
01:02:57,870 --> 01:02:59,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Can't breathe.

999
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:02,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Bring it in, boys!

1000
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:07,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hold it right there! Good.

1001
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:10,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Tap it.

1002
01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:18,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups, and there's gallons more coming!

1003
01:03:18,890 --> 01:03:22,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I think we need to shut down! Shut down? We've never shut down.

1004
01:03:23,830 --> 01:03:26,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Shut down honey production!

1005
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:28,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Stop making honey!

1006
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:34,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Turn your key, sir!

1007
01:03:45,850 --> 01:03:47,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What do we do now?

1008
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:53,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Cannonball!

1009
01:04:01,030 --> 01:04:02,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We're shutting honey production!

1010
01:04:02,970 --> 01:04:04,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Mission abort.

1011
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:07,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Aborting pollination and nectar detail. Returning to base.

1012
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:58,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Adam, you wouldn't believe how much honey was out there.

1013
01:04:58,290 --> 01:04:59,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh yeah?

1014
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:02,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What's going on? Where is everybody?

1015
01:05:02,860 --> 01:05:05,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Are they out celebrating? They're home.

1016
01:05:05,430 --> 01:05:08,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}They don't know what to do. Laying out, sleeping in.

1017
01:05:08,430 --> 01:05:11,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way to San Antonio with a cricket.

1018
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:13,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}At least we got our honey back.

1019
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:16,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Sometimes I think, so what if humans liked our honey?

1020
01:05:16,570 --> 01:05:17,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Who wouldn't?

1021
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:21,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's the greatest thing in the world! I was excited to be part of making it.

1022
01:05:23,450 --> 01:05:26,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This was my new desk. This was my new job.

1023
01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:28,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I wanted to do it really well.

1024
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:29,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And now...

1025
01:05:30,290 --> 01:05:31,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Now I can't.

1026
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:45,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't understand why they're not happy.

1027
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:47,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I thought their lives would be better!

1028
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:51,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}They're doing nothing. It's amazing. Honey really changes people.

1029
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:54,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You don't have any idea what's going on, do you?

1030
01:05:54,710 --> 01:05:57,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What did you want to show me? This.

1031
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:00,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What happened here?

1032
01:06:00,750 --> 01:06:03,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That is not the half of it.

1033
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:11,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, no. Oh, my.

1034
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:14,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}They're all wilting.

1035
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:16,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Doesn't look very good, does it?

1036
01:06:16,270 --> 01:06:17,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No.

1037
01:06:17,670 --> 01:06:21,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And whose fault do you think that is?

1038
01:06:23,010 --> 01:06:24,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You know, I'm gonna guess bees.

1039
01:06:24,740 --> 01:06:25,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Bees?

1040
01:06:26,010 --> 01:06:27,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Specifically, me.

1041
01:06:28,010 --> 01:06:32,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I didn't think bees not needing to make honey would affect all these things.

1042
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:37,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's not just flowers. Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.

1043
01:06:37,350 --> 01:06:40,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's our whole SAT test right there.

1044
01:06:40,290 --> 01:06:43,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Take away produce, that affects the entire animal kingdom.

1045
01:06:43,930 --> 01:06:45,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And then, of course...

1046
01:06:45,430 --> 01:06:47,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The human species?

1047
01:06:50,430 --> 01:06:52,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So if there's no more pollination,

1048
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:55,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}it could all just go south here, couldn't it?

1049
01:06:55,410 --> 01:06:58,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I know this is also partly my fault.

1050
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:05,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How about a suicide pact?

1051
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:06,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How do we do it?

1052
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:09,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'll sting you, you step on me. That just kills you twice.

1053
01:07:09,790 --> 01:07:11,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Right, right.

1054
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:16,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Listen, Barry... sorry, but I gotta get going.

1055
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:25,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I had to open my mouth and talk.

1056
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:29,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Vanessa?

1057
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:35,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Vanessa? Why are you leaving? Where are you going?

1058
01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:38,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}To the final Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena.

1059
01:07:38,350 --> 01:07:42,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}They've moved it to this weekend because all the flowers are dying.

1060
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:45,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's the last chance I'll ever have to see it.

1061
01:07:45,860 --> 01:07:50,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry. I never meant it to turn out like this.

1062
01:07:50,390 --> 01:07:52,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I know. Me neither.

1063
01:07:54,930 --> 01:07:58,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Tournament of Roses. Roses can't do sports.

1064
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:02,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?

1065
01:08:03,270 --> 01:08:04,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Roses!

1066
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:07,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Vanessa!

1067
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:09,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Roses? !

1068
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:11,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Barry?

1069
01:08:11,150 --> 01:08:14,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Roses are flowers! Yes, they are.

1070
01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:17,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Flowers, bees, pollen!

1071
01:08:17,390 --> 01:08:20,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I know. That's why this is the last parade.

1072
01:08:20,790 --> 01:08:24,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Maybe not. Could you ask him to slow down?

1073
01:08:24,930 --> 01:08:26,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Could you slow down?

1074
01:08:29,170 --> 01:08:30,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Barry!

1075
01:08:30,830 --> 01:08:34,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}OK, I made a huge mistake. This is a total disaster, all my fault.

1076
01:08:34,410 --> 01:08:35,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yes, it kind of is.

1077
01:08:35,810 --> 01:08:38,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I've ruined the planet. I wanted to help you

1078
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:40,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}with the flower shop. I've made it worse.

1079
01:08:40,580 --> 01:08:43,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Actually, it's completely closed down.

1080
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:45,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I thought maybe you were remodeling.

1081
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:49,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But I have another idea, and it's greater than my previous ideas combined.

1082
01:08:49,420 --> 01:08:51,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't want to hear it!

1083
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:56,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All right, they have the roses, the roses have the pollen.

1084
01:08:56,230 --> 01:08:59,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I know every bee, plant and flower bud in this park.

1085
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:03,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All we gotta do is get what they've got back here with what we've got.

1086
01:09:03,170 --> 01:09:04,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Bees. Park.

1087
01:09:04,370 --> 01:09:05,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Pollen! Flowers.

1088
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:08,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Repollination! Across the nation!

1089
01:09:09,010 --> 01:09:12,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Tournament of Roses, Pasadena, California.

1090
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:15,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}They've got nothing but flowers, floats and cotton candy.

1091
01:09:15,310 --> 01:09:16,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Security will be tight.

1092
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:18,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I have an idea.

1093
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:19,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Vanessa Bloome, FTD.

1094
01:09:20,050 --> 01:09:22,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Official floral business. It's real.

1095
01:09:22,790 --> 01:09:25,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.

1096
01:09:25,260 --> 01:09:26,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Thank you. It was a gift.

1097
01:09:27,860 --> 01:09:30,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Once inside, we just pick the right float.

1098
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:33,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How about The Princess and the Pea?

1099
01:09:33,930 --> 01:09:36,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I could be the princess, and you could be the pea!

1100
01:09:36,930 --> 01:09:38,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yes, I got it.

1101
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:42,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Where should I sit? What are you?

1102
01:09:42,370 --> 01:09:44,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I believe I'm the pea. The pea?

1103
01:09:44,310 --> 01:09:45,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It goes under the mattresses.

1104
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:48,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart. I'm getting the marshal.

1105
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:51,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You do that! This whole parade is a fiasco!

1106
01:09:54,150 --> 01:09:55,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Let's see what this baby'll do.

1107
01:09:57,490 --> 01:09:59,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hey, what are you doing? !

1108
01:10:00,890 --> 01:10:03,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Then all we do is blend in with traffic...

1109
01:10:04,090 --> 01:10:06,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...without arousing suspicion.

1110
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:11,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Once at the airport, there's no stopping us.

1111
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:12,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Stop! Security.

1112
01:10:12,970 --> 01:10:15,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You and your insect pack your float? Yes.

1113
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:17,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Has it been in your possession the entire time?

1114
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:20,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Would you remove your shoes?

1115
01:10:20,210 --> 01:10:22,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Remove your stinger. It's part of me.

1116
01:10:22,580 --> 01:10:25,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I know. Just having some fun. Enjoy your flight.

1117
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:35,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Then if we're lucky, we'll have just enough pollen to do the job.

1118
01:10:36,890 --> 01:10:40,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Can you believe how lucky we are? We have just enough pollen to do the job!

1119
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I think this is gonna work.

1120
01:10:42,470 --> 01:10:43,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's got to work.

1121
01:10:43,630 --> 01:10:46,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Attention, passengers, this is Captain Scott.

1122
01:10:46,340 --> 01:10:48,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We have a bit of bad weather in New York.

1123
01:10:48,710 --> 01:10:51,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It looks like we'll experience a couple hours delay.

1124
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:55,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Barry, these are cut flowers with no water. They'll never make it.

1125
01:10:55,550 --> 01:10:57,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I gotta get up there and talk to them.

1126
01:10:57,710 --> 01:10:58,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Be careful.

1127
01:11:01,650 --> 01:11:04,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Can I get help with the Sky Mall magazine?

1128
01:11:04,220 --> 01:11:07,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'd like to order the talking inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.

1129
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:14,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Captain, I'm in a real situation.

1130
01:11:14,230 --> 01:11:16,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What'd you say, Hal? Nothing.

1131
01:11:16,330 --> 01:11:17,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Bee!

1132
01:11:17,770 --> 01:11:19,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Don't freak out! My entire species...

1133
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:26,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What are you doing?

1134
01:11:31,250 --> 01:11:34,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Wait a minute! I'm an attorney! Who's an attorney?

1135
01:11:34,350 --> 01:11:36,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Don't move.

1136
01:11:40,790 --> 01:11:41,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, Barry.

1137
01:11:42,860 --> 01:11:45,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Good afternoon, passengers. This is your captain.

1138
01:11:45,730 --> 01:11:50,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B please report to the cockpit?

1139
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:51,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And please hurry!

1140
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:56,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What happened here?

1141
01:11:56,070 --> 01:11:59,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}There was a DustBuster, a toupee, a life raft exploded.

1142
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:02,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}One's bald, one's in a boat, they're both unconscious!

1143
01:12:03,380 --> 01:12:05,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Is that another bee joke? No!

1144
01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:06,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No one's flying the plane!

1145
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:11,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This is JFK control tower, Flight 356. What's your status?

1146
01:12:11,150 --> 01:12:14,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This is Vanessa Bloome. I'm a florist from New York.

1147
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:15,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Where's the pilot?

1148
01:12:15,830 --> 01:12:18,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He's unconscious, and so is the copilot.

1149
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:21,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Not good. Does anyone onboard have flight experience?

1150
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:23,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}As a matter of fact, there is.

1151
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:25,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Who's that? Barry Benson.

1152
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:27,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}From the honey trial? ! Oh, great.

1153
01:12:27,770 --> 01:12:30,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Vanessa, this is nothing more than a big metal bee.

1154
01:12:30,410 --> 01:12:32,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's got giant wings, huge engines.

1155
01:12:32,510 --> 01:12:33,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I can't fly a plane.

1156
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:36,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot? Yes.

1157
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:37,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How hard could it be?

1158
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:42,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Wait, Barry! We're headed into some lightning.

1159
01:12:45,090 --> 01:12:49,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This is Bob Bumble. We have some late-breaking news from JFK Airport,

1160
01:12:49,190 --> 01:12:52,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}where a suspenseful scene is developing.

1161
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:54,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Barry Benson, fresh from his legal victory...

1162
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:56,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's Barry!

1163
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:59,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...is attempting to land a plane, loaded with people, flowers

1164
01:12:59,670 --> 01:13:01,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and an incapacitated flight crew.

1165
01:13:01,970 --> 01:13:03,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Flowers? !

1166
01:13:03,110 --> 01:13:07,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We have a storm in the area and two individuals at the controls

1167
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:10,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}with absolutely no flight experience.

1168
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:12,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Just a minute. There's a bee on that plane.

1169
01:13:12,580 --> 01:13:17,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson and his no-account compadres.

1170
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:19,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}They've done enough damage.

1171
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:20,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But isn't he your only hope?

1172
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:23,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Technically, a bee shouldn't be able to fly at all.

1173
01:13:23,630 --> 01:13:25,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Their wings are too small...

1174
01:13:25,630 --> 01:13:28,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Haven't we heard this a million times?

1175
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:31,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}"The surface area of the wings and body mass make no sense."

1176
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:33,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Get this on the air! Got it.

1177
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:35,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Stand by. We're going live.

1178
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:39,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The way we work may be a mystery to you.

1179
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:42,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Making honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of small jobs.

1180
01:13:42,780 --> 01:13:44,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But let me tell you about a small job.

1181
01:13:44,980 --> 01:13:47,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}If you do it well, it makes a big difference.

1182
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:50,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}More than we realized. To us, to everyone.

1183
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:54,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's why I want to get bees back to working together.

1184
01:13:54,490 --> 01:13:58,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's the bee way! We're not made of Jell-O.

1185
01:13:58,100 --> 01:13:59,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We get behind a fellow.

1186
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Black and yellow! Hello!

1187
01:14:06,270 --> 01:14:07,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Left, right, down, hover.

1188
01:14:07,870 --> 01:14:09,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hover? Forget hover.

1189
01:14:09,510 --> 01:14:12,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This isn't so hard. Beep-beep! Beep-beep!

1190
01:14:15,180 --> 01:14:16,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Barry, what happened? !

1191
01:14:17,010 --> 01:14:19,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Wait, I think we were on autopilot the whole time.

1192
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:23,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That may have been helping me. And now we're not!

1193
01:14:23,150 --> 01:14:25,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.

1194
01:14:29,660 --> 01:14:33,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All of you, let's get behind this fellow! Move it out!

1195
01:14:33,860 --> 01:14:35,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Move out!

1196
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:47,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Our only chance is if I do what I'd do, you copy me with the wings of the plane!

1197
01:14:47,510 --> 01:14:48,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Don't have to yell.

1198
01:14:48,610 --> 01:14:51,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm not yelling! We're in a lot of trouble.

1199
01:14:51,210 --> 01:14:54,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's very hard to concentrate with that panicky tone in your voice!

1200
01:14:54,890 --> 01:14:57,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's not a tone. I'm panicking!

1201
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:09,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I can't do this!

1202
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:13,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Vanessa, pull yourself together. You have to snap out of it!

1203
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:14,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You snap out of it.

1204
01:15:14,670 --> 01:15:15,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You snap out of it.

1205
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:18,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You snap out of it! You snap out of it!

1206
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:20,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You snap out of it! You snap out of it!

1207
01:15:40,860 --> 01:15:43,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You snap out of it! You snap out of it!

1208
01:15:43,230 --> 01:15:45,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hold it! Why? Come on, it's my turn.

1209
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:48,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How is the plane flying?

1210
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:49,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't know.

1211
01:15:50,110 --> 01:15:51,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hello?

1212
01:15:51,210 --> 01:15:54,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Benson, got any flowers for a happy occasion in there?

1213
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:55,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The Pollen Jocks!

1214
01:15:55,780 --> 01:15:57,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}They do get behind a fellow.

1215
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:59,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Black and yellow. Hello.

1216
01:15:59,980 --> 01:16:02,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All right, let's drop this tin can on the blacktop.

1217
01:16:03,050 --> 01:16:05,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Where? I can't see anything. Can you?

1218
01:16:05,620 --> 01:16:07,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No, nothing. It's all cloudy.

1219
01:16:07,990 --> 01:16:10,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Come on. You got to think bee, Barry.

1220
01:16:10,290 --> 01:16:12,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Thinking bee. Thinking bee.

1221
01:16:12,460 --> 01:16:15,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

1222
01:16:15,830 --> 01:16:18,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Wait a minute. I think I'm feeling something.

1223
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:21,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What? I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.

1224
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:23,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.

1225
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:25,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Bring the nose down.

1226
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:31,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

1227
01:16:31,650 --> 01:16:35,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What in the world is on the tarmac? Get some lights on that!

1228
01:16:35,820 --> 01:16:39,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

1229
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:42,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Vanessa, aim for the flower. OK.

1230
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:46,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Out the engines. We're going in on bee power. Ready, boys?

1231
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:47,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Affirmative!

1232
01:16:50,330 --> 01:16:52,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.

1233
01:16:52,940 --> 01:16:54,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Land on that flower!

1234
01:16:54,670 --> 01:16:56,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Ready? Full reverse!

1235
01:16:56,340 --> 01:16:57,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Spin it around!

1236
01:17:00,710 --> 01:17:02,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Not that flower! The other one! Which one?

1237
01:17:02,810 --> 01:17:05,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That flower. I'm aiming at the flower!

1238
01:17:05,250 --> 01:17:09,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt. I mean the giant pulsating flower

1239
01:17:09,950 --> 01:17:12,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}made of millions of bees!

1240
01:17:12,860 --> 01:17:15,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.

1241
01:17:16,530 --> 01:17:18,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Rotate around it.

1242
01:17:18,730 --> 01:17:22,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This is insane, Barry! This's the only way I know how to fly.

1243
01:17:22,300 --> 01:17:26,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane flying in an insect-like pattern?

1244
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:29,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid. Smell it. Full reverse!

1245
01:17:29,870 --> 01:17:31,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Just drop it. Be a part of it.

1246
01:17:32,540 --> 01:17:34,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Aim for the center!

1247
01:17:34,580 --> 01:17:37,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!

1248
01:17:47,820 --> 01:17:49,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Come on, already.

1249
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:57,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Barry, we did it! You taught me how to fly!

1250
01:17:57,900 --> 01:18:00,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yes. No high-five! Right.

1251
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:03,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Barry, it worked! Did you see the giant flower?

1252
01:18:03,410 --> 01:18:07,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What giant flower? Where? Of course I saw the flower! That was genius!

1253
01:18:07,980 --> 01:18:10,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Thank you. But we're not done yet.

1254
01:18:19,590 --> 01:18:20,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Listen, everyone!

1255
01:18:20,790 --> 01:18:23,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This runway is covered with the last pollen

1256
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:26,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}from the last flowers available anywhere on Earth.

1257
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:29,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That means this is our last chance.

1258
01:18:29,770 --> 01:18:34,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We're the only ones who make honey, pollinate flowers and dress like this.

1259
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:37,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}If we're gonna survive as a species, this is our moment!

1260
01:18:37,370 --> 01:18:39,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What do you say?

1261
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:44,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Are we going to be bees, or just Museum of Natural History key chains?

1262
01:18:44,380 --> 01:18:45,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We're bees!

1263
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:47,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Keychain!

1264
01:18:47,250 --> 01:18:51,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Then follow me! Except Keychain.

1265
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:53,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hold on, Barry. Here.

1266
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:54,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You've earned this.

1267
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:03,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah!

1268
01:19:05,970 --> 01:19:10,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.

1269
01:19:14,810 --> 01:19:16,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, yeah.

1270
01:19:16,150 --> 01:19:18,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's our Barry.

1271
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:29,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Mom! The bees are back!

1272
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:45,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}If anybody needs to make a call, now's the time.

1273
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:47,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I got a feeling we'll be working late tonight!

1274
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:03,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Here's your change.

1275
01:21:03,590 --> 01:21:07,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Have a great afternoon! Can I help who's next?

1276
01:21:07,420 --> 01:21:10,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Would you like some honey with that? It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.

1277
01:21:12,260 --> 01:21:16,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me. And I don't see a nickel!

1278
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:20,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Sometimes I just feel like a piece of meat!

1279
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:21,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I had no idea.

1280
01:21:21,970 --> 01:21:24,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Barry, I'm sorry. Have you got a moment?

1281
01:21:24,510 --> 01:21:27,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Would you excuse me? My mosquito associate will help you.

1282
01:21:27,780 --> 01:21:28,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Sorry I'm late.

1283
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:30,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He's a lawyer too?

1284
01:21:30,250 --> 01:21:35,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I was already a blood-sucking parasite. All I needed was a briefcase.

1285
01:21:35,150 --> 01:21:36,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Have a great afternoon!

1286
01:21:37,050 --> 01:21:41,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Barry, I just got this huge tulip order, and I can't get them anywhere.

1287
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:43,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No problem, Vannie. Just leave it to me.

1288
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:46,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're a lifesaver, Barry. Can I help who's next?

1289
01:21:46,630 --> 01:21:49,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All right, scramble, jocks! It's time to fly.

1290
01:21:49,830 --> 01:21:51,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Thank you, Barry!

1291
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:56,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That bee is living my life!

1292
01:21:56,740 --> 01:21:57,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Let it go, Kenny.

1293
01:21:57,940 --> 01:22:00,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}When will this nightmare end? ! Let it all go.

1294
01:22:06,650 --> 01:22:09,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Beautiful day to fly. Sure is.

1295
01:22:09,150 --> 01:22:12,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Between you and me, I was dying to get out of that office.

1296
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:30,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}亲，有空的时候可以来交流电影哦 加我QQ：1610169789

1297
01:29:42,100 --> 01:29:44,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You have got to start thinking bee, my friend.

1298
01:29:45,010 --> 01:29:46,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Thinking bee! Me?

1299
01:30:21,480 --> 01:30:24,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hold it. Let's just stop for a second. Hold it.

1300
01:30:24,310 --> 01:30:27,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone. Can we stop here?

1301
01:30:27,980 --> 01:30:31,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm not making a major life decision during a production number!

1302
01:30:31,490 --> 01:30:34,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All right. Take ten, everybody. Wrap it up, guys.

1303
01:30:34,660 --> 01:30:36,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I had virtually no rehearsal for that.
