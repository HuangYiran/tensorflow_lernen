1
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:04,430
Okay, Max, I figured out our new schedule.

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:05,930
And I figured out the cheap toothpaste

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:09,160
we've been using is really diaper cream.

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,960
On the plus side, that rash cleared up on my gums.

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,100
We'll do our diner shift from 6:00 till 2:00,

6
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,000
then sell cupcakes here from 2:00 to 4:00,

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,130
make the cupcakes in the morning from 7:00 to 11:00,

8
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:19,960
and then pastry school from 12:00 to 4:00.

9
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,460
- Forget anything?  - Just poopin' and sleepin'.

10
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,260
Now, I have to go rewrite the schedule.

11
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,100
Let's go, Max, you have a huge, huge day tomorrow.

12
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,630
First day of pastry school.

13
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,360
Stop saying it's huge.

14
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,630
Whenever I think something's gonna be huge

15
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:35,900
it just turns out to be all balls.

16
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,900

18
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,330
I splurged and had my blouse cleaned.

19
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:57,030
Dry cleaning bags remind me of when I had money.

20
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,500
Really? They remind me

21
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,530
of when my mother tried to suffocate me.

22
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,800
Allegedly. Let's go.

23
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,260
Wait, wait. Max, you can't go yet.

24
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,230
I need you to stay and help with something.

25
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:09,030
Han, I told you... it's bend and wipe,

26
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,760
then up come your big boy pants.

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,900
Yeah, Han's right. You can't go.

28
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,460
Stay here a few more minutes.

29
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,130
Why? Oh.

30
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,730
Are we having an intervention for Max?

31
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,630
Hey, everybody.

32
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,360
Oh, I hope I'm not late r Max's

33
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,730
first day of school surprise party.

34
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,000
Sophie, we hadn't surprised her yet.

35
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,930
Oh, but she's right there.

36
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,430
You just blew it, Han.

37
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,630
Aw, a surprise party.

38
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,860
- Isn't this sweet, Max?  - I don't trust it.

39
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,630
Last time Oleg yelled "surprise" at me,

40
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:44,700
his penis was on a hot dog bun.

41
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,060
One meat lover's pizza.

42
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,700
And one meat lover.

43
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,630
Max, come on. Get it while it's hot.

44
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:55,030
You're opening that box.

45
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,630
Hm, who's got a ten

46
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:59,530
to tip the cute pizza delivery guy?

47
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:01,930
Sophie, this is Luis, the day waiter.

48
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:04,900
Oh, you're Sophie,

49
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,830
Oleg's ex.

50
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,360
Sister, I know all about you.

51
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,860
Oh, do you?

52
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,900
Do you know all about me?

53
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,630
I'm his good friend.

54
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,930
You know, I'm having trouble hearing your accent.

55
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:23,030
Did you say "good friend" or "girlfriend?"

56
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,430
Please, mami. I wish.

57
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,200
I like the entertainment.

58
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,630
It's better than the magician

59
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,100
at my friend Stephanie's 16th birthday

60
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,830
that made her virginity disappear.

61
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,730
Max, we're all so proud of you.

62
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,160
Tomorrow is the first day of the rest of your life.

63
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,560
Aw, crap. I gotta do this again?

64
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,730
All right, but this time, I'm not seeing

65
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,500
trouble with the curve.

66
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,700
You are about to do something very big.

67
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,800
Yes, she is. Such a big step.

68
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,560
Big step for both of us,

69
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,130
'cause I'll be using my business acumen

70
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,130
working in the office to help pay the tuition.

71
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:57,230
Shh. I'm talking about Max.

72
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,100
So we all chipped in to get you something

73
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,200
for your first day of school.

74
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,500
It's my first day too.

75
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,030
Caroline, please, I can't hear Han

76
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,200
talking about Max, okay?

77
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,130
Here you go, darling,

78
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:10,360
a book bag for school.

79
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,100
So what, then? Is my surprise party

80
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,430
after this one?

81
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,430
What is happening?

82
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:18,130
People doing nice things for me and smiling?

83
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:22,130
Am I transferring foster homes again?

84
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:23,730
And there's more stuff inside.

85
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,660
That was supposed to be a surprise too.

86
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:30,630
Oh. Surprise!

87
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,400
Max, open it. Look inside.

88
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,930
Yeah, Max, see what's inside for your big day.

89
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:38,260
Big day for Max. Big day for me as well.

90
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,900
A metrocard? No way.

91
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,260
From me. Unlimited rides.

92
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,430
Oh. Unlimited rides?

93
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:48,300
Is that what your tramp stamp says?

94
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,860
I was gonna get mad, but that was a damn good one.

95
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,900
What's this? Han's house?

96
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,160
A simple "thank you" would suffice.

97
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,500
Thank you for your house, Han.

98
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,460
It's a pencil case, and I love it.

99
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,960
And I was sitting here, thinking how you were

100
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,660
all ignoring my part of the big day.

101
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,530
And then, you give me this pencil case

102
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:17,600
to use in the office and prove me wrong.

103
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,960
That's for Max.

104
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,700
What the hell is wrong with you people?

105
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,200
Max doesn't even need pencils.

106
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,260
She'll be baking.

107
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,960
Well, she'll be baked.

108
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,860
Take a look.

109
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,160
Joints.

110
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,660
Earl, that's so sweet.

111
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,160
These should last me till recess.

112
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,960
Wait, where's the chef's coat Sophie had monogrammed?

113
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,900
Han, that was supposed to be a surprise.

114
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,360
Oh, I know. Karma's a bitch.

115
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,900
Oh, well.

116
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,100
Look.

117
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,330
My name's on this.

118
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,630
The only thing my name's

119
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:57,830
ever been on before is a urine sample.

120
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,400
Thank you, everyone.

121
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,200
So there is nothing in that bag for me?

122
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,260
Nothing? Wow.

123
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:09,060
I'd even take Oleg's penis in a hot dog bun right now.

124
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,100
I'll be right back.

125
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:18,860
- Getting on.  - Please move.

126
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,030
- Getting on.  - Please move.

127
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,430
- Getting on!  - Please move!

128
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,430
- On!  - Move!

129
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:26,160
- On! On!  - Move! Move!

130
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,260
I love the subway.

131
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,760
It's the perfect place to get out aggression.

132
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,260
I just punched someone in the kidney.

133
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,630
It was me.

134
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,030
I know.

135
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,230
Oh, oh, bad smell,

136
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:40,130
Like someone hooked up with a falafel.

137
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:42,030
- It was me.  - I know.

138
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:43,560
- Max.  - Sorry.

139
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,030
Subways, planes, and mosh pits, I let it ride.

140
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,300
I love the smell

141
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,860
of this fresh, dry-cleaned blouse.

142
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,430
I am so excited

143
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,760
to be out of that waitress uniform,

144
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,630
and back in my chic business clothes,

145
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,460
And, you know, going to my office,

146
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,800
where I'll probably save the day

147
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,730
using some of my Wharton magic.

148
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:03,360
You know, I think I like you better without hope.

149
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,660
Max, you know this school is expensive, right?

150
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,160
You're going in with a good attitude, right?

151
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,800
No, that's what Earl's pencils are for.

152
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,400
Don't worry, I'll do my best.

153
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,060
I mean, look, I have a book bag.

154
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,760
The only thing my mother ever sent me to school with

155
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,260
was a note that said "check me for lice."

156
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:21,260
It was so sweet of everyone to give you that,

157
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,300
even though I didn't sleep all night about it.

158
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,730
And it looks kind of expensive.

159
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,130
Check for a designer label.

160
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,430
Why? It's the thought that counts.

161
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,800
Since when?

162
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,060
Let me see it.

163
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,230
Second avenue station.

164
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,300
This is second avenue.

165
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,560
No, no, no, Max!

166
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,530
No, he got the book bag. Good, Max, good.

167
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,030
Don't let go.

168
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,130
What if the train starts to leave

169
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,360
and my arms pop off?

170
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,200
How will I go to pastry school?

171
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,660
I'll be one of those people decorating cookies

172
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,330
with a bag in their mouth.

173
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:48,760
You are the devil.

174
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,860
The devil.

175
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,660
You have nothing.

176
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,600
Pull, max, pull! Pull it from the devil!

177
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,430
Can't. The devil works out.

178
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,430
Ooh!

179
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,160
My bag.

180
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,700
My blouse.

181
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,900
My weed.

182
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,460
Oh, great, look. Class has started.

183
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:21,460
My new life already blows.

184
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,960
Oh, look. There's chef gorgeous.

185
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,400
I don't want him to see me like this.

186
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,700
I'm gonna go to the restroom and see

187
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,730
If cold water can get out any of the stain.

188
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:30,900
- Go, Max.  - But I don't have my chef coat or book bag.

189
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,500
I know I only had them for a couple of hours,

190
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,830
But it was the best part of me.

191
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,500
You'll do great.

192
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,930
First, do me a favor. Check me for lice.

193
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,230
This course is designed to introduce you

194
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,330
To the skills and techniques required

195
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,930
in the production of yeast bread,

196
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:49,100
Short pastry doughs, custards, pate a choux,

197
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,230
And cake batters.

198
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,830
Chef Max, you are late.

199
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:55,730
Wait, are sure class doesn't start at 10:17?

200
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,100
Sorry, I got robbed on the subway

201
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,430
{\an8}(Jerk除了有混蛋的意思 还是人名)

202
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,430
By some jerk.

203
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,360
Hey, hey, hey, I'm right here.

204
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,100
I ran out of options, and I didn't wanna

205
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,460
strip my way through pastry school.

206
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,830
That's an option?

207
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,760
{\an8}(因主厨是法国人 口音比较重 发音不标准)

208
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,760
All right, chefs. Let's focus.

209
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,530
Did he say he wants to "foke us"?

210
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,530
(污渍更脏了)

211
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,530
Morning, Bebe.

212
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:26,760
Hi. Oh, my god.

213
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,100
What happened to you?

214
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,800
And I should tell you my doctor says

215
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,130
I'm not allowed to hear bad news for another month.

216
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:34,830
I apologize for my appearance.

217
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,260
We got robbed on the subway,

218
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,100
And then someone hit me with hot coffee.

219
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,760
Then, I went to wash cold water on the stain

220
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,230
And somehow wound up entering myself

221
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:44,100
in a wet t-shirt contest.

222
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,830
Um, that's a lot of energy for me,

223
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:50,000
So I'm just gonna need to sit here

224
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,200
for a second and be quiet.

225
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,660
I know we're being quiet, which I'm all about,

226
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,260
But cute dogs.

227
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,560
Oh, thanks. They're cocker spaniels.

228
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,900
I rescue them.

229
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,430
You know, people rescue greyhounds

230
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,900
And pit bulls, but everyone ignores

231
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,430
The cocker spaniel.

232
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,830
They're like, "ew, eye goo.

233
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:08,660
Shoot it."

234
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,600
I have three cockers.

235
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,430
Do you have any pets?

236
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:13,860
I have a horse, Chestnut.

237
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,600
He's a thoroughbred.

238
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:24,800
Well, what can I do first?

239
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,200
What's this?

240
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,760
Why am I holding a juice menu?

241
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,030
Every day, we get fresh-pressed juice

242
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,360
For the students and the staff.

243
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,500
What a treat.

244
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,930
Fresh juice is such a scam

245
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,430
Unless someone else is payin'.

246
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:37,860
I'll take the greens number three.

247
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,060
Uh-huh, well, put it on the list

248
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,030
When you get the other ones.

249
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:43,130
Wait, I'm supposed to get the juice?

250
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:47,360
Oh, boy, it's like I'm a bad news machine.

251
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,400
Oh. Okay.

252
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,830
Happy to do it. Surprised, but happy.

253
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,860
Uh, maybe I could change

254
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,560
Into one of those cute chef jackets.

255
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,400
Oh, Chef Nicholas only permits pastry chefs

256
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,930
To wear these.

257
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,230
But I can't meet everyone on my first day

258
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,660
Looking like this.

259
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,760
I mean, it's already bad enough

260
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,830
I'm the juice girl.

261
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,760
I have some workout clothes you can wear.

262
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,660
Don't worry. I haven't worn them yet.

263
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,730
But I will someday.

264
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:19,760
Hi. Hi, everyone.

265
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,260
I'm here to take the fresh juice orders

266
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,560
And also to say this is not what I came to work in.

267
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,600
What I came to work in had less eyes.

268
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,200
Caroline, welcome.

269
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,700
How is it going in the office so far?

270
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:34,760
So great, and so not what I came to work in.

271
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,630
I'm usually wearing chanel, not le chien.

272
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,500
That's "dog" in french.

273
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,000
Oh, 'cause it's "dork" in english.

274
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,930
Well, it is lovely to see both of your faces.

275
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:49,230
Class, we start with the basics.

276
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,400
No, no, no, you in the back...

277
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,060
Juice, Miss? Care for a juice

278
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,630
From someone who scored 1560 on her SATs?

279
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:58,760
You can score more than 500?

280
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,600
Why the hell are you wearing that?

281
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,360
I didn't think your chest could get any sadder.

282
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,260
It's Bebe's.

283
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,530
Max, taking juice orders

284
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:07,930
Is not what I came here to do.

285
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:11,100
I hear you. I'll have the ruby red.

286
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,430
I always keep the edge clean,

287
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:13,660
So when I'm squeezing it,

288
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,730
It's not gonna have cream

289
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:18,060
Popping all over the place.

290
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,060
Words to live by.

291
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,900
I have the opposite problem.

292
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:27,760
Yo, my cream's poppin' right now.

293
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,100
What are you doing? You told me

294
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,900
You were gonna take school seriously.

295
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,760
It's not me. That guy's a bad influence.

296
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,060
Look at him.

297
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,560
He looks like someone who sells drugs

298
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,460
On sesame street.

299
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,630
You're gonna get in trouble,

300
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,130
And I am not wearing a cocker spaniel

301
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:43,560
So you can get kicked out of class.

302
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,730
Right. I hear you.

303
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:47,260
Now, where's my juice?

304
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,930
Hey, chef Max. Check out my technique.

305
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,960
Awesome gross sound bonus.

306
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,230
Chef, if you find this so funny,

307
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,430
{\an8}(他原意是说抽个烟休息 但是发错音了)

308
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,430
why don't you take a fiver?

309
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,200
Isn't this how your saying goes?

310
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,560
I don't have a saying,

311
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,260
But if I did, it'd be more like

312
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:09,100
"eatin' ain't cheatin'."

313
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,930
Anyone else who finds something hilarious

314
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:17,700
can also go into the hall.

315
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,600
- Chef Max? Nope,  - nothing 'ilarious.

316
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,960
Teach on.

317
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,000
Enough with the dirty jokes.

318
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,030
{\an8}(master baker有"烘焙师"和"自慰的面包师"之意)

319
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,030
We are all here to become master bakers.

320
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:31,560
Master-baking is something I work really hard at it.

321
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:36,100
- To be a master baker...  - I'll be in the hall.

322
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,800
- Hi, I'm Deke.  - Did you say "freak?"

323
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,530
- Deke.  - Did you say "geek?"

324
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:49,060
Deke, as in "big deke."

325
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:56,200
Mine's bigger.

326
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,660
We should be lab partners.

327
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,500
Come on. It'll be bitchin'.

328
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,600
Max and Deke, making cakes.

329
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,430
Sunday, sunday, sunday, with a special performance

330
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:06,360
By Creed.

331
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,000
Okay, now stop, stop, stop.

332
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,560
I am trying to be a good student,

333
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,030
So you just stay away from me.

334
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,930
You are a bad influence.

335
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:14,530
And I know I nailed that speech 'cause kids at school

336
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,200
Used to say it to me all the time.

337
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,100
Time to change your tampon?

338
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,330
Yep.

339
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:23,930
Day two. Serious flow.

340
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:27,700
Killer fanny pack. Where's your tribal poncho?

341
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,160
Ah, keep my needles in this.

342
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,360
You're a drug addict too?

343
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,200
God. You are irresistible.

344
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,030
It's... it's insulin. I'm a diabetic.

345
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:39,600
A diabetic pastry chef.

346
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,100
Wow, you're even more self-destructive than me.

347
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,760
So diabetes, how is that?

348
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:49,260
Disappointing. I put in for syphilis.

349
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,030
Stop laughing. I have to carry 27 juices

350
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:55,430
2 blocks wearing this.

351
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:58,630
Why'd you let the dog lady talk to you like that?

352
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:02,160
She's my friend, even in that shirt.

353
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:09,400
Well, there goes another $12.

354
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,400
I have spent more money dry cleaning this blouse

355
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,660
Than I have on health care.

356
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,800
Health care? You mean that box of band-aids

357
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,100
We got at the 99 cent store?

358
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,160
I just have to look good tomorrow.

359
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,830
Today was mortifying.

360
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:26,130
They called me "sad dog" at the juice place.

361
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:30,400
"Sad dog, your juices are ready."

362
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:34,060
Sad dog, pick up.

363
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,460
Can you take these to table ten? I'm backed up on the booths.

364
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:39,930
Can you? I'm kind of just sitting here a minute,

365
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:41,800
Enjoying not being told what to do.

366
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,200
I get enough of it at that school.

367
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,000
Look.

368
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,330
If you're gonna do the martyr thing, do it right.

369
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,700
Stick your hand in boiling oil

370
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,460
or even more painful, binge-watch

371
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,930
Shahs of sunset on bravo.

372
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:57,730
I need to talk to you in the kitchen now.

373
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,100
Leave, someone's about to get schooled about school.

374
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,160
This looks like it's going to get dirty and ugly.

375
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,830
May I film it?

376
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:10,860
And if so, may I then sell it on the internet?

377
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,700
Look. You can't just do this for me.

378
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,530
You're right. So we're out?

379
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:17,230
No, we're not out, you said you were gonna do this for me.

380
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:18,730
I know, but you just said

381
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:19,960
I can't just do it for you,

382
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,230
And I agree.

383
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,230
I mean, who was I kidding?

384
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:24,000
Me. You were kidding me.

385
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,130
I went in there thinking I was gonna use

386
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:28,560
My business skills, and whatever hope

387
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,330
I had of a flirtation with frenchie mcfrench

388
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,460
Went out the window when he saw me

389
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,960
Wearing that t-shirt that said,

390
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,400
"don't forget to spay and neuter me."

391
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,830
Fine, I can quit. It's fine.

392
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:40,200
- It is? Really?  - No, it's not fine.

393
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,730
- Who am I kidding?  - Me. You were kidding me.

394
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,160
Well, you've gotta figure out something there

395
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,200
To keep you interested, because you can't go

396
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,800
To pastry school just for me,

397
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,760
And I'm not gonna not go to pastry school for you.

398
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,900
Okay. You're right, Max.

399
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,830
Of course I'll do it for you.

400
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:53,830
I just had a bad day.

401
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:55,500
I mean, we both did.

402
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,400
You lost your man's briefcase and your drugs,

403
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:02,230
and I lost my dignity and a possible love interest.

404
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:05,030
Surprise!

405
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,400
See, that's how it's supposed to go.

406
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,030
We got you a new book bag.

407
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:11,000
Yeah, and a new chef's jacket.

408
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,100
And a switchblade.

409
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,630
Yeah, cause we're not buying another chef's jacket.

410
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:20,200
Max, you know what this means?

411
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,960
That I got two surprises, and you got nothing?

412
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,130
No, that everything's gonna work out at that school.

413
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:27,460
I mean, in the blink of an eye,

414
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,930
just like this, things can change

415
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,460
from bad to good.

416
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,360
Well, not totally good. They still haven't

417
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,960
gotten me anything.

418
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,600
Caroline, you didn't not get anything.

419
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,530
Here, your very own pencil case.

420
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:45,630
But no pencils. My pencil dealer got busted.

421
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,160
Aw. Thank you, guys.

422
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,160
I'm touched. I was not expecting it.

423
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:55,960
Really?  Cause you kinda bullied us all into it.

424
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,260
So that's a 780 on verbal,

425
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,460
and a 780 on math.

426
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,300
And with my degree in Finance,

427
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,300
jackass-ing around the city getting juice

428
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,060
could be seen as a waste of my talents.

429
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,760
And as the valedictorian at my graduation said...

430
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,160
And I'm stealing from myself here,

431
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,200
"I've seen the future of Finance,

432
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,430
and it's us."

433
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,930
So you want me to get the juices?

434
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:30,400
Just for today. Please?

435
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,730
Meringue cookies are a simple way

436
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,960
to practice our pastry bag technique.

437
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,830
Hm, interesting technique you got going there, chef.

438
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,360
Dude, we gotta ditch these deadbeat partners.

439
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,860
I'm stuck over there with grandma.

440
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,260
No, I'm staying with the big guy next to me.

441
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,330
He's not gonna get me in trouble.

442
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,000
He never talks. Get outta here.

443
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,500
{\an8}"胖子阿伯特"主角是一名肥胖的黑人

444
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,500
Go back to your own table, fat Albert.

445
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,000
Okay.

446
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,660
I'm going back.

447
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,300
And the fat Albert thing was cause I'm black,

448
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,060
Not fat, right?

449
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,800
Cause I go to the gym two, three times a year.

450
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,130
I hear talking, but no baking up front.

451
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:03,300
No, no, no, you only hear baking.

452
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:07,760
Just furiously master-baking up here.

453
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,860
The meringue needs to have nice peaks.

454
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,860
You are looking to make moist, pointy peaks.

455
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:16,900
I like to pinch them.

456
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,800
Chef, seriously, man-to-man,

457
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,860
We got a problem.

458
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,800
I don't think Max should be stuck with that big guy.

459
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,160
He's not cool.

460
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,730
I was just over there, and the only

461
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:28,230
pointy peaks he's interested in are hers.

462
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:30,400
Talkin' boobies here, chef.

463
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,300
Chef John, chef Deke here

464
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,030
seems to think you are sexually harassing Max.

465
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:38,830
Oh, please.

466
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:41,030
If I was harassing anyone, it would be you, chef.

467
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:45,030
I mean, come on.

468
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,300
Be right back, big Mary.

469
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:53,330
You know it.

470
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:55,000
Where's my juice? It's been an hour.

471
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,230
The mood swing elf's getting them.

472
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,900
Look, I'm coming in there

473
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,700
to flirt with chef Nicholas, and when I enter,

474
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:04,560
i need you to say, "Caroline, you look amazing."

475
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,400
No.

476
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,430
I actually physically can't say that.

477
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:10,000
I would rather walk in there and yell,

478
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,160
"i have crabs, and three of them just escaped."

479
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,460
Call 9...1...1. Call 9...1...1.

480
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:18,330
Something's happened to the adorable mixed-race one.

481
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:20,700
Deke?

482
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,700
He's Diabetic. He needs insulin.

483
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,530
Has anyone here ever administered a needle?

484
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,630
Uh, administer means the same thing as "shove it in," right?

485
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:29,530
Good, good, good, Max. Come, come, come.

486
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:31,960
Okay, uh, his syringes are in his fanny pack.

487
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,260
I've actually never done this

488
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,930
without Iron maiden playing in the background,

489
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:36,360
but I'll give it a shot.

490
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,560
Just put it anywhere in my hot bod.

491
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,600
God help us.

492
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,260
Oh, I hate needles. I can't look.

493
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:48,030
Oh.

494
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:51,660
Get it together, ladies.

495
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:56,300
This is why I'm not allowed to hold babies.

496
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,600
Max, I think you and Deke

497
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,400
should be Lab partners from now on

498
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,900
in case something like this happens again.

499
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,560
- Is that okay?  - I guess if I have to.

500
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,160
Max?

501
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,330
I guess if I have to.

502
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,830
What, did you not take your insulin on purpose?

503
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:16,330
I really wanted to be your partner.

504
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,730
Bebe, I can't find a chef jacket anywhere in here.

505
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:22,600
And I'm sorry, I know I'm not supposed to wear one,

506
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,560
but I'm really cold, and I can't walk around

507
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,900
like this all day.

508
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,660
Maybe I can help.

509
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,000
You can't stand there wet and cold.

510
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,100
- Take my jacket.  - Oh, no, no, no.

511
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,100
You don't have... oh, that'll work.

512
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,700
I'm sorry about the no shirt under,

513
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,500
but I just get so hot when I'm teaching.

514
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:42,530
Yeah, hot. So hot.

515
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:44,600
Oh mon dieu.

516
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,260
I was just giving it to Caroline.

517
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,500
I mean, she needs something to wear,

518
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,030
and... and now, she has it.

519
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:53,930
Chef, I will see you later.

520
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:56,760
Caroline.

521
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,760
Max, I think I found something to keep me interested.

522
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,260
This is weird. So I'm the good student now?

523
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:06,260
And you're the one sleeping with the teacher?

524
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,730
We're not sleeping together.

525
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:10,130
Why? Do you think he wants to?

526
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:11,530
I don't know, but you better hurry it up

527
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:14,930
before big Mary gets him.
