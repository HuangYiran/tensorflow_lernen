当时已经是我到球队后的第二还是第三场主场比赛了
Jeremy lin: So it was like my second or third home game,

8
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,170
我甚至还从未上过场
And I hadn't even been in a game yet,

9
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,440
当我试图进入球馆时
And I had tried to get in the gym,

10
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,740
他们拦住我
And they stopped me.

11
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,670
他们说
And they were like,

12
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,280
“抱歉，这里是球员入口”
"oh, sorry, this is the players' entrance."

13
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,780
我说，“我知道啊”
I was like, "I know."

14
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,410
那个保安就困惑地看着我
He looked at me confused,

15
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,580
于是我也困惑地看着他
And then so I was looking at him confused.

16
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,250
然后他说
And then he was like,

17
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,620
“哦，抱歉，你是队上的训练师吗？”
"oh, I'm sorry. Are you a trainer?"

18
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,820
我站在那不知道说什么好
And I was just kind of just like standing there.

19
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,290
然后另一个保安走过来
And then another security guard came over

20
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,430
对着之前那个耳语道，“他应该是在队上打球的”
And, like, whispered, "I think he plays on the team."

21
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,330
现在上场的是后卫...
At guard it's...

22
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:15,940
十七号，林书豪！
Number 17, jeremy lin!

23
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,140
书豪
Hey, jeremy.

24
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,540
Hi.

25
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,880
没有人认为他会打球
Nobody thought he could play.

26
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,780
他需要为所得的一切而战
He had to fight for everything that he got.

27
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,920
你很少能有这种感觉：你见证了
It's not often you think you've seen something

28
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,690
联盟中罕见的奇迹
You couldn't possibly see in the nba.

29
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:36,820
林投篮！
Lin puts it up!

30
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,230
进了！
Bang!

31
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,460
等等，这小子是谁？
Wait a minute. Who's this kid?

32
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,530
等等，他从哪冒出来的？
Wait. Where's he from?

33
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:42,600
等等，落选秀？
Wait. Not drafted?

34
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,800
等等，被多少球队裁掉过？
Wait. How many teams waived him?

35
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,370
当他打球时
When this guy is playing,

36
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,270
勇士队不知道他这么棒
And golden state doesn't know he's any good,

37
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,840
火箭队不知道他这么棒
Houston doesn't know he's any good,

38
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,900
我不得不想，难道是因为
I got to imagine that something has to do with

39
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,670
他看上去不像个打球的好手
He doesn't look the part.

40
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,210
林书豪从默默无闻走到伟大
Jeremy lin came from nothing to greatness.

41
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:59,180
嘿，这小子给所有孩子以希望
Hey, this kid is giving hope to all those kids

42
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,280
那些认为自己永远不会有机会的孩子
That think, "never could I have a chance."

43
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,190
我一直对自己说，我的进步历程会是这样
I always told myself my progression is gonna be

44
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,650
从进入轮换，到成为首发控卫
Become a rotation player, become a starting point guard,

45
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,460
然后赢得NBA总冠军
And then win an nba championship.

46
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:13,530
人们听到后肯定会嘲笑我
And people are definitely gonna laugh when they hear that.

47
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,060
但是有朝一日这一切成真时
You know, they're not gonna be laughing

48
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,460
他们就不会再笑了
If it actually happens.

很可能就此终结他的NBA事业
并结束他的一生梦想

New york foul is on shumpert, his second.

54
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,830
现在他得下场休息会儿了
And now, he'll have to take a seat,

55
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,390
看看谁要上场了
And, again, mike, look who's coming in.

56
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,130
是林书豪，你可以听到球迷的大声欢呼
Jeremy lin, and you hear a pretty big ovation.

57
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,910
我知道是神在安排这一切
Jeremy: I know god orchestrated this whole thing.

58
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,140
因为太多事情在我的掌控之外
There's just too much out of my control.

59
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:10,880
而且它们发生的方式是那样的不可思议
And just the way it happened is just miraculous.

60

书豪！
Jeremy!

61
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,460
是真的
It's actually true.

62
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:28,600
在我大概八、九岁后
After, I think, age maybe 8 or 9,

63
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,140
我们换掉了电视
We got rid of the tv,

64
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,310
我们会在季后赛时看比赛
And we would just get it during the playoffs.

65
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,780
我们会在家看
We would watch it in the house

66
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,180
然后在后院
And then, in the backyard,

67
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,540
有扇玻璃门，外面有个篮筐
There's a glass door and a hoop outside,

68
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,780
我们会在外面透过窗子看
So we would just watch through the window,

69
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,580
然后在场间休息或是暂停时
And then any time there was,like, a break or a time-out,

70
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,690
我们会出去模仿
We'd go out, and we'd do the exact move

71
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,290
刚刚球场上出现过的动作
That just happened.

72
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,060
基本上就全部都是模仿乔丹
And it was pretty much all just copying michael jordan

73
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,060
并且看到他取得胜利
And watching him win.

74
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,460
我们热爱那种观看比赛的方式
And so we loved watching basketball that way,

75
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,260
那一直是我的一个梦想
And it was always a dream of mine,

76
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,930
但我从未想过它会变成现实
But I didn't actually think it would be a reality.

那我就开始练习打篮球

我自己练习了五年，像怎么运球，怎么投篮

She was always supporting us.

坚强的意志?
Strong will?

坚强的意志
Strong will.

148

如果他想要什么东西
If he wants something,

149
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:33,380
他会竭尽所能去得到
He will do anything to get that thing.

150
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:36,320
他会把头往地上撞
So he will knock his head on the ground.

151
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,720
他会故意摔倒
He will just make himself fall.

152
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,790
他会做一切事情来试图得到自己想要的东西
He will do anything to get what he wants.

153
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,600
在我成长过程中，我的家庭总是强调神是首位的
Growing up, my family always emphasized god first,

154
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,410
学业其次，运动第三
School second, athletics third.

155
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:02,310
刚开始，他们并不确定
In the beginning, they weren't sure

156
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,040
我能打多久的篮球
How long I could play basketball.

157
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,410
他们就是决定顺其自然
They were just gonna ride it out

158
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,850
尽可能地享受篮球带来的快乐
And have fun with it as long as we could.

159
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,860
我当时受邀前往一场
帕罗奥托的基督教青年会联赛

你不会想到
You know, you wouldn't think it,

163
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,270
他的得分能力这么出色
But he just scored the basketball so well.

164
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:36,340
第一场比赛时
The first tournament we played,

165
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,750
他开始狂投三分
And he just starts just raining 3-pointers.

166
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,250
Yeah!

167
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,620
他们说我叫得太大声了
They will say I am so loud,

168
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,890
因为我会不停喊“防守！”
Because I will keep talking, "defense!"

169
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:49,760
或是“抢篮板！”
You know, "get a rebound!"

170
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:52,930
Yeah!

171
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,490
当然他妈妈当时会那样
Of course, mom's like,

172
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,230
不停喊“他得了多少分？”
"how many points
did he score?"

173
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,660
她会说，“我告诉过你他棒极了吧”
She'd say, "I told you he was pretty good."

174
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,430
我会说，“我知道，我知道他很棒”
I go, "I know. I know he's pretty good."

175
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,640
当时所有AAU的球队都不要书豪
All the aau team, they never want jeremy,

176
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,840
即便他是当时最棒的控卫
Even though he's the best point guard at that time.

177
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,380
只有这一支球队
Only this particular aau,

178

Metro Mirage非常想要书豪为他们打球
Metro mirage, want him so bad.

179
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:16,320
耶，书豪！
Yeah, jeremy!

180
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,750
我喜欢处在这个被轻视的位置
I love being the underdog

181
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,620
因为这是我习惯的角色
Just because it's just what I'm used to.

182
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,330
也许我在联盟中会打得不错
You know, I would be good in this league,

183
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,690
但人们会说
And then people would say,

184
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,600
“但是他在这个联盟中不可能打好的”
"oh, but he can't play well in this league."

185
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,770
每次书豪对位某个人们都说棒的球员
Every time jeremy play against somebody who people say is good,

186
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:36,840
如果书豪打得更好
If jeremy played better,

187
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,070
他们就会开始想，其实是这人不行
Then they start thinking, "that person's not good."

188
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:41,010
而不会肯定书豪打得好
They don't give jeremy credit.

189
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:46,150
有一种十四块钱的超大玉米饼
There's a $14 extra-large burrito

就像这么大
That's like this.

191
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:51,350
我的天，你一定得买那个吃
Oh, my gosh, you should totally get that.

192
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:53,250
书豪，你要买这个大的吗？
Jeremy, you gonna get the big one?

193
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,750
是的
Jeremy: Yeah.

194
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,460
人与食物大对决
Man versus food.

195
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,690
我要开启野兽模式了
I'm about to beast this.

196
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:05,370
我也不知道我是怎么长这么高的
Jeremy: I don't know how I got so tall, dude.

197
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,430
我食量很大
I ate a lot.

198
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,900
我会去吊单杠
I would hang
from monkey bars.

199
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,910
我会躺在床沿想着
Um, I would lie off the edge of my bed thinking

200
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:17,010
重力会把我拉长
That gravity would pull me and make me taller.

202
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,820
我记得，我妈妈也记得
I remember--my mom remembers this, too--

203
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,590
每天早上我钻进车里时
I would get in the car every single day

204
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,290
我都会说，“你们为什么不长高点？”
And I'd be like, "why aren't you taller?"

205
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:29,720
这就是我一直这么矮的原因
Like, "this is why I'm so short."

206
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,990
我妈妈会说，“要怪就怪你爸”
She always said, "blame your dad.

207
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,730
“我可不矮”
I'm not that short."

她有差不多一米六八
She's 5'6".

对于亚裔女性来说这挺高的
For an asian woman, that's pretty tall.

也是他给我的最大难题

“书豪，你有创造机会的能力

他谈到神如何给予和收回
He talks about how god gives and takes away.

253
00:12:54,700 --> 00:13:00,210
神拿走了我那时特别在乎的东西
And so god took what I really cared about at that time

254
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:03,140
来说明，离开神
To show me that I can't do what I want to do,

255
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:06,450
我就不能完成我的愿望

00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:51,780
他们会发现
They just realize he's just...

405
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,920
他就是个普通人
You know, he's human.

406

听着不错，好，再见

{\i1}还获得了加州冠军
And winning a state championship,{\i}

409
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,550
{\i1}林书豪得到的唯一一份

410
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:23,250
{\i1}能够打篮球的大学录取通知

{\i1}哈佛
Called harvard.{\i}

413
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:28,990
第一天上课
My first day at class,

414
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:31,120
我被彻底吓着了
I was just super-intimidated.

415
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:33,290
我去参加数学分班测验
I went and took my math placement test,

416
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:36,430
他们说，如果你不会做
And they were like, "if you don't know how to do this,

417
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:38,900
可以交卷走人
Feel free to turn it in and leave."

418
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,970
我看着试卷，心想
I looked at it and I was, like,

419
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:42,770
天呐，我啥也看不懂
"dude, I don't know what's going on here."

420
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:45,340
于是我交了卷
So I turned it in, and I was,

421
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:48,140
我大概是第二个交卷的
Like, maybe the second person who turned it in.

422
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,510
我心想，天，我在哈佛的
I was like, "man, I just, like,

423
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,940
第一场测验就挂了
Failed my first test at harvard."

424
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:56,420
第二天，我们进行中文分班测验
The next day, we had the chinese placement test,

425
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,180
然后他们说
And they gave us the test, and they're like,

426
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,090
如果你读不懂，可以交卷
"if you can't read it, just turn it in."

427
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:04,990
我读不懂啊，就又交卷了
I couldn't read it, so I turned it in again,

428
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:06,830
那是连续两次测验挂掉
And that was back-to-back failed tests

429
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,660
我甚至一个答案都写不出
Without even filling in an answer.

430
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:13,630
我在电话里跟我妈妈说
I called my mom, I was like, "man,

431
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,070
以后估计很难熬了，要做好心理准备
This is gonna be pretty tough, so just get ready."

432
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:23,310
很大程度上，林书豪去哈佛
In a lot of ways, jeremy lin going to harvard

433
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,980
是符合逻辑的
Was a very logical thing.

434
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:30,050
哈佛有23名
There were 23 asian-americans at harvard

435
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:32,150
姓林的亚裔学生
Whose last name was lin.

436
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:34,020
所以林进入哈佛
And so for jeremy lin to show up at harvard,

437
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,390
作为亚裔的孩子
Being this asian-american kid,

438
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:39,090
数学成绩好
Who had a perfect math sat ii score was,

439
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:41,060
你也知道，并不少见
You know, nothing rare.

440
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:44,760
但是他打篮球很厉害的这个事实（却很特别）
But the fact that he was amazing at this game,

441
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:48,730
问题是他如何融入哈佛？
The question was then how did he fit in at harvard?

442
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,240
汤米·艾默科
There is tommy amaker,

456
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,770
我知道我们有些特别的因素
We knew we had something pretty interesting,

00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:26,140
特别是林书豪
Especially with jeremy,

458
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:28,410
因为首先他训练特别刻苦
Because of how hard he worked, first of all,

459
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:30,780
而且篮球对他而言非常重要

460
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:31,980
还有就是他的天赋
And then his talent.

461
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,280
我认为他被大大地低估了
I think he was very much underrated,

462
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,950
我认为他想按照

侵略性强，无所畏惧

538
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,930
“哟，滚回到中国去”
"yo, take your ass back to china,"

539
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:07,430
或者说：“你就是个中国货”之类的
Or like, "you're a chinese import," or whatever.

540
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,400
上了大学以后，这些攻击更离谱了
When I got to college, it just, like, got crazy.

541
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,640
比如说：“中国佬！”
It was just like, "you chink!"

542
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,340
什么“你能张开眼睛吗？”
You know, "can you even open your eyes?

543
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,540
你看得见分数牌吗？
Can you see the scoreboard?"

544
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,110
这种乱七八糟的东西
You know, just like crazy stuff.

545
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:19,880
我心想：这都什么跟什么啊？
And I'd just be like, "dude, like, what is going on?"

546
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:22,580
{\i1}身处目光的焦点中
Being in the spotlight{\i}

547
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,550
{\i1}为林书豪带来不可避免的副产物
Brought jeremy an inevitable byproduct:{\i}

548
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:29,090
{\i1}关注，有正面的，也有负面的
Attention, both positive and negative.{\i}

549
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:33,030
人们在看篮球运动员时
I mean, people look at basketball players in terms of...

550
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:34,990
如果用种族的角度去看
Of race a lot of times.

551
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,030
在美国，篮球往往被视为
Basketball is not considered

552
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:39,270
不是给亚裔玩的运动
An asian sport here in america.

553
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,370
我们打客场时
We'd be playing on the road,

554
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:41,900
在常春藤的某个体育馆里
Specific gyms in the ivy league,

555
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:45,540
他们会向他喊一些种族歧视的脏话
And they would yell racial slurs to him.

556
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,210
在常春藤联盟，看到种族歧视的辱骂
It was shocking to me to see racial taunts

557
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:48,540
让我很惊讶
In the ivy league,

558
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,880
到了这个级别
Because you think that at that level,

559
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,810
当然你会认为
Certainly in the supposed, you know,

560
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:56,980
学术氛围应该很浓厚
Very academically progressively oriented

561
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:00,620
这些校园里会有很多亚裔的学生
Group of schools full of asian students on their campuses

562
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:03,420
种族歧视的侮辱应该是不可想象的
That that would be something that was unthinkable,

563
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,220
但事实并非如此
But it wasn't.

564
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,830
我告诉他，这是一种重视的表现
I just told him, it's a sign of respect.

565
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:09,300
是，他们很无知
Yeah, they're ignorant,

566
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,630
但说到底
But at the end of the day,

567
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:12,200
是他们想要进入你的脑子
They're trying to get in your head.

568
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,130
你在想着他们说的东西
You're thinking about what they saying

569
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,970
而没有想着比赛
And not thinking about the game.

570
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:26,010
好像是在训练中
I think we were just working out,

571
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:28,750
我对他说
And kind of was like, you know

572
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,950
书豪，能跟你说句话吗？
"j, can I speak to you for a moment?"

573
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,220
他让我坐下
He sat me down,

574
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:37,950
{\pos(935,450)}4.4 助攻/场
4.4 篮板/场
16.4 分/场


总共 1,483 分

575
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,050
坐在体育馆外的楼梯上
Like, right outside the gym on the stairs,

576
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,690
他说
And he was like...

577
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:37,490
我不知道有没有人告诉过你
"I don't know if anybody's ever told you this,

578
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:39,930
但我觉得你可以去打NBA
But I think you can be an nba player."

579
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:42,600
他看着我的表情
And he kind of looked at me like, you know,

580
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,860
就像看到圣诞老人
He just saw santa claus or something.

581
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:47,930
我说，你疯了吧
You know, I was just like, "you're crazy," you know.

582
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,400
我说，兄弟，你肯定疯了
I was like, "dude, you are crazy."

583
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,340
我妈妈会说
My mom, you know, would be like,

584
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,080
你可以去打NBA
"you can make it to the nba."

585
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,110
呃，好吧……妈
"all right. Um, okay, mom."

586
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:02,110
这可能吗？
Is this possible?

587
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,450
我想也许他真的
I thought maybe he really...

588
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:05,420
有这个可能
Really have a chance.

589
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,990
当这个问题被提起
When the question was broached,

590
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:09,150
林书豪是不是有能力进入NBA
Is jeremy lin good enough to make the nba,

591
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:12,390
我想正是从那时开始他对这件事情产生兴趣
That's when I think a lot of the interest started surging.

592
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,630
能告诉我这张毯子的来历吗？
Can you tell me the history of this blanket?

593
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:19,300
这张毯子来头可大了
Oh, this blanket is legendary.

594
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,500
是吗？
Yeah?

595
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,930
上面全是《狮子王》的角色
It's all about {\i1}lion king.{\i}

596
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,300
这里有娜娜
We have nala right here,

597
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,870
还有小辛巴，丁满和彭彭
Baby simba, timon and pumbaa.

598
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:28,240
这是我一直以来最喜欢的毯子
This is one of my favorite blankets of all time.

599
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,240
芝麻街那条毯子呢？
What about the {\i1}sesame street blanket?{\i}

600
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,310
不，我第二喜欢的是那条加菲猫的
No. My second favorite is the garfield,

601
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,580
然后才到芝麻街那条
And then {\i1}sesame street.{\i}

602
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:36,520
天……好吧，球迷们
oh, man. All right, fans.

603
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:41,690
晚上好，欢迎来到2010年度选秀
Good evening, and welcome to the 2010 draft

604
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:44,790
来到纽约的麦迪逊花园
At madison square garden in new york city.

605
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:47,730
第一轮，我们也没抱什么期望
The first round, we weren't expecting really much of anything.

606
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:49,960
今晚意味着
Tonight marks the realization of a dream

607
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,460
世界上最好的年轻球员梦想成真
For the best young players in the world.

608
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,200
我们都很紧张
We were just all real nervous,

609
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,740
因为他需要克服很多障碍
Just 'cause there were so many odds to overcome for him.

610
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:00,010
状元签，华盛顿巫师队(奇才队)
And with the first pick, the washington wizards

611
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:03,740
选择来自肯塔基大学的约翰·沃尔
Select john wall from the university of kentucky.

612
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,050
我确实满怀着希望，但是说实在话
I was hopeful,but to be completely honest

613
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:10,820
心里真正想的是：拭目以待到底会发生什么吧
I was like, "let's just wait and see what happens."

614
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,990
我一直留意着种族问题
The thing that I'm always interested in is race

615
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:17,760
联盟里种族歧视这种风气一直存在
And the way discrimination,you know, rears its ugly head.

616
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,630
我很好奇是否有球队会尝试冒险
I was really interested in seeing if a team would take the plunge

617
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:23,600
去选一个美籍亚裔球员
And take this asian-american player.

618
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:26,630
有意思的是
You know, it was funny.

619
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:29,600
我最有机会选上的球队
Like, the team that I had the highest chance

620
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,670
是尼克斯
To get drafted b was the knicks,

621
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:34,340
因为我在试训里打得特别好
cause I crushed that workout.

622
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:39,040
2010 NBA选秀大会第39顺位是
With the 39th pick in the 2010 nba draft...

623
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,550
我想“如果在这里我没有被选中”
I was like,"if I don'get drafted here

624
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:43,150
我很有可能就不会被任何球队选了
I probably won't get drafted."

625
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:44,920
纽约尼克斯队的选择是
The new york knicks select...

626
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,650
我想“天啊，如果我被选中了我该做些什么？”
I'm thinking like,"oh, if I get drafted，what's gonna happen?

627
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,760
我应该要围着会场跑一圈，拥抱每个人吗？
I'm just gonna run around, like，hugging everyone

628
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,090
明天我就要飞去纽约了
I'm gonna fly to new york tomorrow

629
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:55,460
兰德里·菲尔兹，来自斯坦福大学
Landry fields，from stanford university.

630
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:01,830
{\i1}选秀结束后十分钟
10 minutes{\i}after the draft ended,

631
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,640
{\i1}达拉斯小牛队的经理唐尼.尼尔森
Donny nelson,{\i\i1}the general manager{\i}

632
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,270
{\i1}亲自打电话给林书豪
Of the dallas mavericks,{\i\i1}personally called jeremy{\i}

633
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:09,440
{\i1}让他为小牛队夏季联赛效力
And asked him to play{\i\i1}on his summer league team.{\i}

634
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,510
我想大概每个落选的人
I think everyone who goes undrafted,you know,

635
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:16,480
都会有一种想要证明自己的心情，因为他们觉得自己有实力
Feels like they have to prove themselves,because they do.

636
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,920
因此，这对我而言确实是一个好机会
And so, you know,this is a chance

637
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,490
你在夏季联赛的赛场
Where you get to play against people

638
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:22,390
每晚跟选秀大会上落选的球员们一起打球
Who are drafted every single night

639
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:24,960
你要在实战中与他们竞争
And you get to compete with them in practice

640
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,130
而这恰好就是最好的机会
And this is the best opportunity to, you know

641
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:29,430
证明给所有的球队看
Prove to all the other teams

642
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,900
你是值得被选中的
That you deserved to be drafted

643
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,970
你本来应该得到一份合同
And you deserved to have that contract

644
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:34,700
林书豪，巧妙的进攻
Lin, surprise attack

645
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,000
这将是一场很有看头的比赛
Oh, this is gonna be interesting

646
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,970
桑德斯在防守，林成功保住这一球！
Sanders there，lin protected it home!

647
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:41,140
哇！漂亮的进球
Wow! Nice play.

648
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:44,380
我希望林书豪能成功
I hoped that jeremy would make it

649
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,180
因为我对他的实力有信心
Because I had confidence in his ability,

650
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,650
但是我疑虑的是
But I was skeptical

651
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:50,320
是否有一处可以让他真正一展身手的地方
In terms of him getting a real shot anywhere.

652
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,320
林书豪！
Jeremy lin!

653
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,020
接着在夏季联赛
And then I watched him play

654
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:56,960
我看到了他与沃尔的对决
In the summer league against john wall

655
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,790
我们将看到非常精彩的对位
I think we got a primetime match-up

656
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:01,290
约翰·沃尔，联盟选秀的状元
John wall, the number one overall selection

657
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:05,300
沃尔进攻！反手上篮！
Wall, creative!On the reverse.

658
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,700
速度够快吧？
How fast was that?

659
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:10,600
在比赛前一天我告诉林书豪
I talked to him the day before

660
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,370
他将跟约翰·沃尔对位
He was gonna play against john wall

661
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:14,970
这是你关键的一次表现机会
And I told him,"it's your one shot

662
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:18,480
跟沃尔对位你完全没有问题
There's no doubt that you can play against the guy."

663
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,050
林书豪，单手上篮！
Lin.Lin gettin' up there!

664
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:23,350
林将成为联盟里的新宠
He's gonna be an nba crowd favorite

665
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:25,820
在进攻端再次得手
Gotta work on the end.

666
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:28,750
林在右路绕过防守，在他习惯的右路上篮
Lin went right around him on his strong side

667
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,790
林书豪具有
The fact that he could do that

668
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:35,930
与新秀状元对位的能力，这个事实令人激动
Against the number-one player in the nba draft was tremendous

669
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:39,570
评估，建设性的意见
Assessing,constructive criticism

670
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:41,600
好球！
No way. Man!

671
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,900
如果你激发出他的能力，你会看到意想不到的事情
If you explode on him,you'll have something.

672
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,910
你会看到他身上蕴藏着无限的可能
You're gonna get your opportunity

673
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:49,340
他撕开防守，转身投篮
As he splits,spins...

674
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,580
太可惜了！裁判为什么要吹哨子？！
Oh, no, ref!Don't you do that!

675
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,050
观众们都站起来了！
They're on their feet!

676
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:56,180
天呀，这恐怕是要引起一场混战啊
Oh, my god.This is about to be a melee here

677
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,480
拉开他们（解说员开玩笑）
Hold 'em back,hold 'em back!

678
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:01,650
快看，观众们已经陷入疯狂了
Oh, look it, the crowd is going crazy!

679
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,990
他改变了一些人的狭隘眼光
He's opened some eyes

680
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:05,060
如果林不再留在小牛为夏季联赛效力
And if lin doesn't stick with the mavs

681
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,260
会有球队看着他的表现，心想
There are teams out there that are looking at him saying,

682
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,060
天呐，他完全推翻了我们的观念
"boy, he beats their system very nicely."

683
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:11,030
不管他今年是否留在夏季联赛
Whether he's in the league this year or not

684
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:12,360
都会有几支球队想要他的
He'll have some options

685
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,700
是的，会有几支球队想要他的
Oh, he will have some options.

686
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,500
我只是一心想要打球
I'm just trying to play

687
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,000
只要有球队有兴趣与我谈
And if someone's interested, you know,

688
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:20,670
我非常乐意去争取机会
I'd love to talk about an opportunity.

689
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:26,650
我的儿子跟林书豪都是组织后卫
Joe lacob: My son and he both were point guards

690
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:28,350
他们在AAU分属不同的球队
And they were on different aau teams

金州勇士队老板

692
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:30,000
记得在当地的体育馆
And so I remember watching them play

693
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:32,580
我看过他们的AAU比赛
These aau games in these local gyms.

694
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:37,690
当时我跟我的合伙人正好买下了勇士队
But I just happened to buy the team at that time with my partners.

695
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:39,220
我最早跟总经理说的其中一件事就是
One of the first things I told our gm was,

696
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:42,030
“我知道那个球员，我的儿子也知道他”
"look, I know this kid.My son knows this kid.”

697
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:44,700
他非常有天赋，我们应该给他一个机会“
He's really talented.We ought to give him a shot."

698
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,630
我想他们都觉得我有点疯了
I think they thought we were a little crazy,

699
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:49,270
但是我们还是那么做了，当你是老板
But we did, and, you know,when you're the owner,

700
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:51,000
你就有权利做些疯狂的事
You get to do things like that

701
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,970
勇士队球员的平均智商以及篮球智商
The warriors' iq and basketball iq

702
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,310
都上升了一些
Just went up a few points

703
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:59,340
因为他们签了哈佛毕业的后卫林书豪
They signed harvard guard jeremy lin

704
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,780
我打给林书豪告诉他我们将签下他
I called jeremy to tell him.

705
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:03,800
{\pos(837,388)}罗杰·蒙哥马利
林书豪的经纪人

706
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,250
他甚至不相信这是真的
He didn't believe me.

707
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:04,650
他说“别开玩笑了，你是认真的吗？”
He was like,"stop playing, man.Are you serious?"

708
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:06,850
我说“小伙子，这是真的”
I said,"man, it's for real

709
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:08,590
“明天就来场地练习”
"go down to the practice facility tomorrow

710
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:10,890
“然后签下合同，很好吧”
And sign the contract.It's good."

711
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:15,590
于是他说“老兄，我待会给你回电！”
And he was like,"man! I'll call you back."

712
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,800
你知道我几乎不敢相信“天啊”
I was like, "aah!"you know

713
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,530
我叫醒我弟弟
I picked my little brother up,

714
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:22,670
跟他说：金州勇士队签我了
I'm like, "I'm signing with golden state!"

715
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:24,000
我又跑到另一个房间
And I ran into the next room,

716
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,700
叫醒我哥哥
I picked my other brother up.

717
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,440
“勇士队要跟我签约了！”
"I'm signing with golden state!"

718
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,510
我很难描述是怎样一种心情
I can't even really describe it

719
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:33,910
因为我们兄弟从小就为NBA着迷
cause we, like, grew up,like, fantasizing about the nba

720
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:37,080
我们从小到大都支持着勇士队
And, like, the fact that we grew up rooting for the warriors

721
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,920
这一切使书豪进入勇士队显得更不可思议
Made it even that much crazier

722
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,890
作为当代的第一位美籍亚裔NBA球员
Lin has a chance to make history

723
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:44,060
林书豪很有机会创造历史
As the first asian-americannba player in the modern era

724
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:47,190
当他被勇士选中
When he got picked up by warriors

725
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:49,590
那个时刻我们想
That moment,we think

726
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,530
“这就是我希望他做的事情”
"this is what I want him to do."

727
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:53,970
我的梦想就是在NBA打球
My dream was to play in the nba,

728
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:56,470
现在我即将在勇士队完成我的梦想
And now I get to do it for the warriors

729
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:57,840
我是看着这支球队的比赛长大的
The team that I grew up watching

730
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,400
所以加入勇士队的意义比梦想成真还要深远
It's more than a dream come true

731
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,310
我们都知道观众为什么欢呼，林书豪上场了
We know what that's about

732
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:09,850
林书豪，曾是帕罗奥多高中的学生
Jeremy lin.Palo alto high school's own

733
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,850
毕业于哈佛的勇士新秀
Warrior rookie out of harvard

734
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:15,220
当时我上场的时候球馆欢呼声很大
It got pretty loud

735
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,960
观众们站起来为我鼓掌
And people were standing up and clapping

736
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,520
我环顾四周
And I just remember looking around

737
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:20,960
从小是勇士队的球迷
Grew up a warrior fan

738
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,730
长大后被他家乡的球队签下
Signed by his hometown team

739
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:23,860
这是一个了不起的故事
It's a great story

740
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,400
确实如此
It really is.

741
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,930
我终于来到勇士队，我终于成为勇士队的一员
It was so emotional for me to finally get there

742
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,600
这真的让我感慨良多
For me to finally be there

743
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:34,040
一年前我真的不敢想象我会出现在那里
And I couldn't envision myself there even a year ago.

744
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:39,040
当我看着他防守科比，我的感觉真的是（难以言喻）“哇~”
When I saw him guarding kobe,I was like, "wow."

745
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:42,810
我们从小就看科比比赛
We've been watching this guy ever since we were little

746
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,320
他现在……居然可以和科比同时在场上
He's actually...He's there.

747
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:51,020
没进，大卫李拿下篮板球
Missing,lee with the rebound.

748
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:53,190
我喜欢看林控球，不要犯规阻碍他
I love what lin did.Didn't foul him

749
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:55,760
啊~！
Ohh!

750
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,630
准备给灰熊还一记颜色
Ready to returnfor the grizzlies.Williams

751
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:00,270
林有一个空档
Lin's got an open look

752
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:02,330
结果莫名其妙把球传给了巴蒂尔
And then threw it to battier inexplicably

753
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:05,800
欢迎来到NBA
Welcome to the nba

754
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,870
我讨厌所有人都盯着我看
I hate when everyone's looking at me

755
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:10,350
我讨厌聚光灯
I hate the spotlight

756
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:12,680
我如何保持心态做我自己
How am I gonna be myself

757
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,050
每当我碰到球
When every time I touch the ball,

758
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:15,580
每个人都期待着我有疯狂的表现
Everyone's expecting me to do

759
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,220
期待我带来不可思议的比赛
Some crazy, miraculous play?

760
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,750
他得分了！
He scores!

761
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:19,950
观众们可以从我的表情看出一些端倪
People could see it on my face

762
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:21,420
譬如我在场上打球
Like, I was out there playing

763
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,890
但是我并没有打出自己风格
But I wasn't playing my brand of basketball

764
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:25,620
我觉得焦虑不安
I was scared, nervous

765
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:26,990
心里有很多的疑惑
And just, like,a lot of questions

766
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:28,230
巨大的压力
And a lot of stress

767
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:30,130
感觉周围有很多的不确定因素扰乱在心间
And a lot of uncertainty floating around

768
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:34,100
他缺少那么点运气

金州勇士队
2009-2012年总经理

770
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:36,800
球队里已经有两个排在他前面的后卫了
Is the fact there was a player named monta ellis

771
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,210
蒙塔埃利斯和库里
And steph curry ahead of him

772
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:44,240
在NBA水准的比赛里，教练们无疑都想赢球
You know, coaches need to win,at the nba level

773
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,780
当时我们队的教练基思·斯玛特
And so keith smart, who was our coach at the time,

774
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,210
确实没怎么让他上场
Really didn't play him a lot

775
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:50,180
事情就是这样
And this is how these things happen

776
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,520
一开始我告诉自己
At first, I was like,

777
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,990
“他知道我有实力，他知道我可以上场比赛”
"he knows I can play,he knows I can play."

778
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:56,490
可是事实是我基本上没有机会上场
And then I wasn't playing at all,

779
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:58,060
然后我看到体育新闻里写
And then I was, like,reading all these articles like,

780
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,460
“看吧，把他签进来只是为了多卖几件球衣”
"oh, he's just here to sell jerseys

781
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,690
“然后增加球队的收入”
And increase revenue."

782
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,830
我想：也许这就是事实
I was like,maybe that's all it is

783
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:06,870
也许这就是我在这儿起的作用
Maybe that's all I'm good for, you know

784
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:10,040
说实话我们得对自己坦诚一些
I think we have to be honest with ourselves

785
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,040
签林书豪进来肯定是考虑到了市场因素
There was definitely a marketing element to it

786
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,610
我的意思是说他是我们自己家乡人
I mean,he's a hometown guy

787
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:18,040
这里有很大比重的亚裔人口
The area has a significant asian-american population

788
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:19,340
一切都证明了确实是那样的
And the way it played out

789
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:21,350
湾区的球迷为他疯狂
You know, people went bonkers for that

790
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:30,620
在许多美国人眼里亚洲人是十分遥远和陌生的
A lot of what america perceives as asian is very foreign

791
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:33,190
姚明是一个典型的例子
Yao ming was kind of a quintessential example of that

792
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:35,860
他来自中国，他来自东方
He's from china, he's from the east

793
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,330
到达我们的海岸
And he's coming to our shores

794
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:39,260
但是林书豪却不同 ，他是本土产的
Whereas,jeremy is like homegrown

795
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:43,400
他是在美国本土郊外长大的亚裔小孩
He's a homegrown asian-american kid from the suburbs

796
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,200
跟美国其他小孩一样怀着篮球梦长大
He grew up with hoop dreams just like the rest of us

797
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:48,710
看着像林书豪这样的孩子在球场上
Seeing a kid like jeremy on the court

798
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:52,380
穿着勇士队的队服
In a warriors uniform,

799
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,650
这给我们很大的冲击
You know,that's a huge impact

800
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:57,550
你知道，他很开心能为自己家乡的球队效力
You know, he was happy to be playing for his hometown team

801
00:35:57,550 --> 00:36:03,360
但是，我们并不满足于只是进入NBA
But we weren't satisfied with just being in the nba

802
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,160
球迷想看到林书豪冲到篮下
Fans want jeremy lin to go all the way to the rim

803
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,460
但是球却被抢走了
And he has it taken away

{\i1}勇士的管理层
The warriors' management{\i}

{\i1}把林书豪下放到发展联盟
Sent jeremy{\i} {\i1}down to the d-league{\i}

806

{\i1}这是NBA的小型联盟育才体系
The nba's version{\i\i1}of a minor league farm system{\i}

{\i1}他面对着残酷的现实{\i}
{\i1}He was faced with a harsh reality.{\i}

808
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:26,950
发展联盟是一道难关
The d-league is one of the toughest things

809
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:30,250
对于篮球生涯而言
When it comes to a basketball career.

810
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:32,280
发展联盟，你懂的，它是个展示的舞台
The d- league, you know, it's a showcase

811
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,150
人们不在乎你赢了多少场
People don't care how many wins you have.

812
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:37,020
他们只在乎你的数据
All they care about is your stats.

813
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,920
一切都只与你自己有关，虽然你有队友
It's all about you, and you have teammates,

814
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:40,430
但他们其实并不和你站在同一战线上
But they're not really on your team.

815
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:42,360
如果可以的话，他们会抢了你的饭碗
You know, they'll take your job if they can.

816
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,630
你能抢断？
You cut off?

817
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:44,800
你是控卫吗？
You the point guard?

是的
Yeah.

818
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,670
你把球传给我
You pass it to me...

好的
Okay.

819
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:49,200
然后你就在那儿等着
And then just wait out there.

820
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,400
当他去发展联盟的时候，我对他说的话很简单
What I told him when he went to the d-league was simple.

821
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:52,740
把它拿下
Go kill it.

822
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:55,770
去把发展联盟搞定，然后等着别人给我们打电话
Go and crush the d-league, and let's get called up.

823
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,640
因为这是一场战役
Because it's a battle, you know.

824
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:01,510
这就是一场意志上的战役
It's a battle right here.

825
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:05,620
我在想，"天啊，如果我弄砸了"
I was like, "man, like, if I play bad,

826
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,050
我可能就这样了
This may be it."

827

林书豪奋力带球
Jeremy lin drives against squeaky,

828

试图靠近篮架，但把球丢了
to get to the rack, throws it away!

829
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:15,390
我睡不着觉，因为我压力太大了
I couldn't really sleep, 'cause I was so stressed.

830
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,830
我给我哥哥打电话
I called my brother.

831
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:18,260
我说，“我现在很纠结”
I was like, "I'm trippin' right now,

832
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:20,530
我都不知道这是在干嘛
Like, I don't know what's going on."

833
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,730
我想，对他来说，就像是这段旅程
I think, for him, it was just like the journey

834
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,070
让他筋疲力尽了一样
Was kind of wearing on him.

835
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:25,540
因为这条路上的每一步
'cause, like, at every step of the way,

836
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,040
你都要克服所有这些障碍
You have to, like, overcome all these odds,

837
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,610
我认为，到了某个时间点上
And, like, I think at a certain point,

838
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:31,240
这些障碍让他感觉不可逾越
It felt insurmountable for him.

839
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:33,550
所以他那个时候状态不是很好
So he was not in a good place.

840
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:35,210
林需要稳定下来
Lin needs to settle down.

841
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,950
没错，他快没有力气了
Yeah, he's running out of gas.

{\i1}他属于NBA，但在他的新秀赛季{\i}
{\i1}That he belonged, but in his rookie year,{\i}

844
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:44,820
{\i1}他被3次下放到了发展联盟{\i}
{\i1}He was sent to the d-league three times.{\i}

845
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:49,290
我想他被这样送来送去
I think getting sent back and forth

846
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,260
这种经常性来回摇摆的效应
And the constant yo-yo effect

847
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,670
源于被勇士队调回来
Of being taken up by the warriors,

848
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:55,170
又下放回去
Sent back down,

849
00:37:55,170 --> 00:38:00,310
其积累性的结果就是给他沉重的负担
The cumulative effect of it weighed heavily on him.

850
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:01,770
你知道，我一直有那种渴望
You know, I've always had that desire,

851
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,380
我一直有那种渴望在我心中
And I've always had that within me

852
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,410
证明我能在NBA打球
Where I want to prove that I could play in the nba.

853
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:08,080
但是，你知道，我现在在这里是有原因的
But, you know, I'm here right now for a reason,

854
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,680
并且，你知道，神以不同的方式在起作用
And, you know, god works in very different ways.

855
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:16,250
保持住！保持住！来这儿！
Stay up! Stay up! Come here!

856
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,990
我觉得随着每场比赛
You know,I thought with each game,

857
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:19,560
他的自信心都在增强，并且你能看得到
His confidence grew,and you could see it

858
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,990
这几乎是伴随着每次场上的持球
Almost with each possession up the floor.

859
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,200
在他打了20场比赛的那段时间之后
And after his 20-game stint,

860
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,200
我觉得他走出了那段发展联盟经历的阴影

Really believing that he could have an impact in the nba.

Were so ready to just bury him and give up on him.

这对我来说很难
It's hard for me,

因为我真的很热爱篮球
Because I really love basketball.

我的梦想就是打NBA
My dream is to play in the nba,

00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,780
他们是如何在那种文化里成长的
How they grew up in the culture.

932
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:32,950
哦！你把玩偶弄掉了
Oh! Oh! You dropped it!

933
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:34,450
你把它弄掉了
You dropped it!

934
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:36,450
这就是我每年回来的原因
So that's why I come back every summer

935
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,890
就是为了好好感受一下
Just to get a good feel for that.

936
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:42,730
我为我的身份感到骄傲
I'm very proud to be, you know, who I am.

937
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,710
回到农场
Back on the farm.

938
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,720
我现在还是退后一点吧
Oh, I'm gonna back up a little bit now.

939
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:11,620


940
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:32,080
{\i1}（台语）{\i}

941
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,550
来看看我父亲成长的地方
Seeing where my dad grew up,

942
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:35,380
所以40年间可以发生巨大变化
So 40 years makes a huge difference,

943
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:38,520
你知道，从他在这里成长
You know, from him growing up here

944
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:41,750
到我们在美国成长
To how we grew up in the U.S.

945
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,990
这真的是一个很卑微的起步
It's definitely humble beginnings.

946
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:50,500


947
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:04,680


948
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:17,760
嘿，兄弟，你看到那虾了吗？
Hey, man, you see this shrimp?

949
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:24,830
哦，嘿，小心点
Oh, hey, hey. Watch yourself.

950
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:28,900
我的祖父母是在中国出生、长大的
My grandparents are born and raised in china.

951
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,770
我的父母在台湾出生长大
My parents are born and raised in taiwan,

952
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:32,840
我是在美国出生长大
And I was born and raised in the U.S.,

953
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,470
所以这里面有很多的历史
And so there's a lot of history

954
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:37,380
在我的身后有很深厚的文化
And a lot of culture behind who I am.

955
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:40,610


956
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:43,150
{i\1}splendid
( A Whole New World歌词，出自动画片《阿拉丁》）{i\}

957
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:45,620
{i\1}tell me, princess{i\}

958
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:50,990
{i\1}now when did you last let your heart decide? {i\}

959
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:52,390


960
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:56,830
{i\1} I can open your eyes{i\}

961
00:43:56,830 --> 00:44:02,200
{i\1}take you wonder by wonder{i\}

962
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:06,070
{i\1}over, sideways, and under{i\}

963
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:10,440
{i\1}on a magic carpet ride{i\}

964
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:14,350
{i\1}a whole new world{i\}

965
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:17,880


966
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,400
你现在要去做什么？
What are you about to do right now?

967
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,460
我马上要出去
I'm about to go out here

968
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:36,430
去给一个扣篮大赛当评委
And judge this dunk contest.

969
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,070
这是最后的决赛，冠军赛
This is the finale, the championship game,

970
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:39,500
为了耐克夏季联赛
For the nike summer league,

971
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:42,310
所以我现在要去做这个了
So I'm about to get into this right now.

972
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:44,840


973
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,010
他们说我可以讲中文
They said I could speak chinese.

974
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:48,980


975
00:44:56,690 --> 00:44:59,060
林书豪！
Jeremy lin!

976
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:04,400
这里的篮球文化很疯狂
Basketball culture here is crazy.

977
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,530
球迷们很热爱篮球
The fans, they love basketball.

978
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:07,770
这里总有人在打篮球
There's people playing basketball

979
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:10,070
任何时间，在任何球场上
All the time on all the courts.

980
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:12,270
这里的竞赛水平绝对在提升
The level of competition is definitely growing.

981
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:13,840
能有机会看到这些比赛
Got a chance to see some games.

982
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:17,080
所以，你知道，这真是很棒的回归
So, you know, it's definitely awesome coming back

983
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,740
而且还看到这项运动（篮球）在这个国家进步了这么多
And seeing how much the sport has grown in the country.

984
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:22,710
准备，预备，开始！
Ready, set, go!

985
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,590
我想来到这里
I just think coming here,

986
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:33,060
我看到了很多勤奋努力的人
I'm seeing a lot of really diligent, hard workers.

987
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:35,460
我感到所有人都很用功
I feel like everybody works very hard,

988
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:36,830
他们做了所有他们能做的事
And they do everything they can

989
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:38,330
就为了养活他们自己，还有他们的家人
To support themselves and their families,

990
00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:41,030
对于我来说，篮球就是我养活自己和家人的方式
And for me, that way is basketball.

991
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:42,830
我认为勤奋这种精神是根深蒂固的
And I think hard work is definitely ingrained

992
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:46,440
在台湾文化里，在中国文化里
In taiwanese culture, in chinese culture.

993
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,970
所以，对我来说，那是一些
And so, for me, that's something

994
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:51,740
我试着去学会并且接受的东西
I try to pick up on and really embrace.

995
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:02,690
哟，兄弟，我们要出发啦
Yo, man, we gotta go.

996
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:04,590
书豪？
Jeremy?

997
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:14,930
在周五早上12点01分
At 12:01 Friday morning,

998
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:17,200
NBA停摆了所有的球员
The nba locked out its players

999
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,270
因为劳资双方无法在新一轮的集体谈判上达成一致
After failing to reach a new collective bargaining agreement.

1000
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:23,780
停摆对很多人有巨大影响
The lockout has a very large impact on a lot of people.

1001
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:25,480
目前放在谈判桌上的条件
The current offer that is on the table

1002
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,740
不是我们所能接受的
Is not one that we can accept.

1003
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:27,810
停摆可能是几个礼拜
It could be a couple weeks,

1004
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:28,950
也可能是几个月
Could be a couple months.

1005
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:30,280
我们已经听说
We're already hearing

1006
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:32,150
这将是一个长期的停摆
This is gonna be a very long lockout.

1007
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:36,690
我们将进入NBA的严冬
We're about to go into the nuclear winter of the nba.

1008
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:40,760
劳资双方的工资谈判过程
The collective bargaining process

1009
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,490
已经完全破裂
Has completely broken down.

1010
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:43,690
我们都身处其中
We're all in this together.

1011
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:45,060
如果这些球员不给他们
And if these players don't give them

1012
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:46,960
想要的，他们是不会开工的
What they want, they're not going to play.

1013
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,400
我不认为这个问题得到了解决
I don't think it's resolved.

1014
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,070
我觉得这是个很糟的建议
I think it's bad advice.

1015
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:52,800
我其实私下里
I actually secretly

1016
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,310
希望这次停摆能继续
Wanted the lockout to continue,

1017
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:57,680
因为这给了我额外的时间去提高
Because it gave me extra time to get better.

1018
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,710
我们愿意继续谈判
We are willing to continue discussions

1019
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:01,880
基于一个有可能性的妥协的基础上
On a potential compromise.

1020
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:03,180
有一些老板
There are some owners

1021
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:04,850
愿意走在这个赛季之前
Who are willing to forego the season.

1022
00:47:04,850 --> 00:47:06,220
我们想要打篮球
We want to play basketball.

1023
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:07,690
那就是我们做的事
That's what we do,

1024
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:09,820
现在，我们没有一个机会
And right now, we don't have an opportunity

1025
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:11,090
去球场上做我们最擅长的事
To go out and do what we do best.

1026
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:13,220
如果整个赛季都没了
If we need to lose an entire season,

1027
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:15,130
那也只能这么干了
We should go ahead and do it.

1028
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:17,730
我所有浸满汗水的T恤都在这了
I got all my sweaty t-shirts in here, man.

1029
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:20,100
那太恶心了
That's disgusting.

1030
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:23,370
所以我知道停摆时间越长
So I knew the longer the lockout went,

1031
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:25,770
我就会成为越出色的球员
The better player I would become.

1032
00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:31,010
我们在热身
We're warming up.

1033
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:33,710
我们只是在热身
We're just warming up.

1034
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:36,580
就是这样，那一发很完美
Boom. That's it. That one was perfect.

1035
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:38,650
感觉好吗？
Feel good?

感觉很好
Feels good.

1036
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:40,420
当他成为一个更好的投手
As he gets better as a shooter,

1037
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:43,960
随着时间过去，就像钱，钱，钱一样
Over time it's gonna be like money, money, money.

1038
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:46,490
他只会变得越来越好
He's only gonna get better,

1039
00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:49,590
而且他真的非常好，难道不是吗？
And he's awfully good now, don't you think?

1040
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,830
要进入他这个脑袋，那是另外一部分
That's the other part, getting into this cranium

1041
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:57,130
让他相信自己，就像我相信他一样
To get him to believe like I believe in him.

1042
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:59,440
圣诞快乐，篮球迷们
Merry christmas, basketball fans.

1043
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,840
NBA重新开赛了
The nba is coming back.

1044
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:02,210
球迷们就快得到他们梦寐以求的了
Fans are getting what they want.

1045
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:04,640
老板们和球员们达成了试行性的协议
Owners and players reached a tentative agreement

1046
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,310
终结了149天的停摆
To end the 149-day lockout.

1047
00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:22,690
进入到我的第二年
Going into my second year,

1048
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:26,460
我没有
I'm not really, like,

1049
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:28,800
去想任何让我害怕的事情
Thinking about anything I'm afraid of.

1050
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,100
你知道，我感觉，经历了我的第一年
You know, I feel like through my first year,

1051
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:33,500
至少在我眼中
At least in my own eyes,

1052
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:36,470
我已经向自己证明，我能在这个水平打球
Like, I proved to myself that I can play at this level.

1053
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:40,140
我想在心态上，我变得更好了
And I think mentally, I'm at a much better place

1054
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:42,610
我能就这样进去，然后做我自己
Where I'm just going in, and I'm just gonna be myself

1055
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:44,220
打我自己的比赛
And play my own game,

1056
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:46,650
从那个立场来看，我真的一点也不畏惧
And from that standpoint, I'm really not afraid

1057
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:47,890
在进入训练营后发生的事情
Of anything going into training camp.

1058
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:49,920
我感觉我已经没有什么可以失去了
I feel like I have nothing to lose.

1059
00:48:58,030 --> 00:49:01,130
我们缺一个感到满意的中锋
We didn't have a center that we felt good about,

1060
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:06,140
我们需要足够的薪水空间
And we needed to create enough salary cap space

1061
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:07,340
去招揽一个中锋
To go make an offer,

1062
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:10,740
为了这样做，我们要裁掉一些球员
And in order to do so, we had to cut somebody.

1063
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:12,880
这是我们做过的决定中
It was one of the hardest decisions

1064
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,710
最艰难的决定之一
That we could have had to make.

1065
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:17,480
他们中途给我打电话
They called me upmidway through

1066
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:18,980
在训练的中途
In the middle of a drill.

1067
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:20,550
他们说，“嘿，你需要到楼上来一趟”
They're like, "hey, you got to go upstairs."

1068
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:21,950
我走到楼上，然后总经理
I went in there, and the general manager

1069
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,550
和助理总经理说，
And assistant general managerwere like,

1070
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:24,890
“我们得裁掉你”
"we gotta let you go.

1071
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:26,720
“我们想要德安德鲁·乔丹”
We're trying to get deandre jordan."

1072
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:31,860
他已经在赛季前付出了巨大的努力
He had worked tremendously hard pre-season,

1073
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:34,900
所以我想，“天啊，这是一个大打击啊”
o I was like, "man, this is a blow.

1074
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:37,370
我的意思是，这就像一脚，刚好踢在你的肚子上
I mean, this is a kick in the stomach right here."

1075
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:40,140
他们就像
They were like,

1076
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:41,640
“哦，我们祝你好运”
"oh, we wish you the best of luck."

1077
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:44,640
我说，“谢谢”
I was like, "thanks."

1078
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:50,150
{\i1}48小时后{\i}
{\i1}Within 48 hours,{\i}

1079
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:52,820
{\i1}他被休斯敦火箭队接收{\i}
{\i1}He was picked up by the houston rockets.{\i}

1080
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:55,720
是的，我们一直在希望
Yeah, we were hoping

1081
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:57,250
没有其他队把他挑走
That no one else picked him up.

1082
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:59,290
我们对他感兴趣，已经有很长一段时间了
We were interested in him for quite a long time.

1083
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:01,930
看过他在哈佛的比赛
Had been to his games at harvard.

1084
00:50:01,930 --> 00:50:04,630
那时候，我们就把他招进来，然后说
At the time, we just added him and said,

1085
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:08,300
“嘿，让他加入看看会发生什么”
"hey, let's bring him in and see what happens."

1086
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,770
我就去了休斯敦
I went to houston.

1087
00:50:11,770 --> 00:50:13,240
当时那里有6个控卫
There were six point guards there.

1088
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:16,410
我甚至没法参加训练
I couldn't even get reps in practice.

1089
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:18,080
我不明白
I don't understand.

1090
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:20,010
我在金州勇士队是个候补控卫
I was backup point guard at golden state,

1091
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:21,280
现在他们把我带到这里
And now they're gonna bring me here,

1092
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,710
然后我成了第六根弦（吉他声音最低的那根弦）？
And I'm sixth string?

1093
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:24,820
林书豪在带球
Jeremy lin on the drive.

1094
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:28,320
把球带到篮筐，然后上篮
Take it to the rim, lays it up.

1095
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:31,390
在马刺队大个子球员面前的一个好球
Good shot with the spurs' bigs right in his face.

1096
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:33,190
当火箭队接收了他
When the rockets picked him up,

1097
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:36,260
对于他来说，可能已经是跌入瓶底了
That was probably the bottom of the barrel for him.

1098
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:37,930
一个周日晚上，我们在联谊会上
Sunday night, we were in fellowship,

1099
00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:43,400
我记得林书豪说，“嘿，我得走了”
And I remember Jeremy said, "hey, I gotta go.

1100
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,540
“我得赶飞机去休斯顿“
"I gotta catch my flight to Houston."

1101
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:47,270
他当时站在门口
He was standing at the door,

1102
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:52,210
他眼中含泪，因为……
And he had tears in his eyes, because, um...

1103
00:50:52,210 --> 00:50:54,010
因为压力真的让他难以承受
Because the pressure was really getting to him.

1104
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:57,050
他不知道他的未来里还有什么
He just didn't know what his future was gonna hold.

1105
00:50:57,050 --> 00:50:59,320
我记得他转向我，然后说
And I remember he turned to me and he says,

1106
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:01,390
“我不知道我还能不能继续撑下去”
"I don't know if I can keep doing this."

1107
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:05,490
{\i1}仅仅在火箭队待了12天{\i}
After only 12 days with the rockets,

1108
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:07,630
{\i1}他再一次被裁{\i}
{\i1}He was cut again.{\i}

1109
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:09,960
{\i1}那天正好是圣诞节
It was christmas day.{\i}

1110
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:17,300
过去几周显然发生了很多事情
So obviously a lot has been happening the last couple of weeks.

1111
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:18,570
你心里在想什么？
What's going through your mind,

1112
00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:20,740
你今天感觉怎么样？
And how you feeling today?

1113
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:23,270
圣诞节早上，我被裁了
Christmas morning, I was waived.

1114
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,780
圣诞夜，我坐飞机回家
Flew back home on christmas night,

1115
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:29,550
两周之内，我两次被裁
And within two weeks, I had been waived twice

1116
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:34,320
而裁掉我的两个队说他们还需要我
By two teams who said they still wanted me.

1117
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,290
今天早上10点
10 a.M. This morning,

1118
00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:38,420
我得知纽约尼克斯队选了我
Um, found out the knicks had picked me up.

1119
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:41,030
马上我将第一次为尼克斯队上场
And that's gonna be my first game with the knicks.

1120
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:43,130
在甲骨文球馆（金州勇士队主场，林书豪待的第一支NBA球队）
It's gonna be at oracle arena.

1121
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:48,030
这场比赛明天晚上就要打了
You know, I'm literally going into this game tomorrow night,

1122
00:51:48,030 --> 00:51:50,470
而我还完全不知道队友有哪些人
I have no idea who my teammates are.

1123
00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:52,240
我从未和他们一起打过球
I've never played with them one time.

1124
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,970
我完全不知道我们执行什么战术
I have no idea what plays we run.

1125
00:51:53,970 --> 00:51:55,970
球队的一个战术也不清楚
I don't know a single play,

1126
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:57,980
甚至还没和教练讲过话
And, you know, I haven't even talked to the coach yet,

1127
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:00,180
所以这下“好玩”了
So it's gonna be interesting.

1128
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:02,110
林书豪要上场了
I see jeremy lin coming in.

1129
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,380
他们（尼克斯）今天刚刚签下他
They just signed him today.

1130
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:04,580


1131
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:06,980
只是在赛前的投篮练习稍微活动了一下
Went through a walk-through, at shoot-around today.

1132
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:09,920
林去年在金州勇士队打过寥寥几场比赛
Lin, who played with golden state last year sparingly,

1133
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,360
在发展联盟也打过
Played in the d-league,

1134
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:13,060
欢呼很热烈
Gets a nice ovation.

1135
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:14,760
这是我绝好的机会
It's a great opportunity for me

1136
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:16,030
只要能打上球
To be able to just play,

1137
00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:17,360
现在对我来说
And I think, for me right now,

1138
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,200
最重要的一件事
The one thing I really care about

1139
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:23,270
就是这样一个打球的机会
Is just an opportunity to play.

1140
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:24,670
我将倾尽全力
I'm gonna give my best effort,

1141
00:52:24,670 --> 00:52:26,600
就算最终失败
And, you know, if I go down,

1142
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:28,840
我也要用我的方式证明自己
I'm gonna make sure I go down doing it my way,

1143
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:31,140
同时，也是神的方式
Which is god's way.

1144
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:33,580
所以比赛前一晚
So it's the night before,

1145
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:35,410
我打包好了行李
And, you know, I gotta get my bags ready,

1146
00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:37,980
明天的比赛过后，我们将前往洛杉矶
And after the game tomorrow, we head to l.A.,

1147
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:40,820
再来是萨克拉门托，然后将飞去纽约，一直待在那里
Sacramento, and then I'm off to new york for good.

1148
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:58,840
五场比赛过去了，我却一分钟都没上
Five games go by, and I'm not playing at all.

1149
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:02,940
我觉得这一切都说不通
Nothing was really making sense to me.

1150
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:04,340
如果你签了我
If you bring me in,

1151
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:06,240
却连球队训练也不让我打
And you don't let me play in practice,

1152
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:08,880
更不要说正式比赛了，那为什么要我呢？
Let alone the games, then why am I here?

1153
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,880
我当时觉得，我可以帮助你们
I felt like, you know, I could help you,

1154
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:13,320
而只能眼睁睁地看着球队输球
And I was watching us lose.

1155
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:16,390
尼克斯队已经四连败了
The knicks have lost four straight games.

1156
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:18,360
连败还在继续
And the losing streak continues.

1157
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:21,190
尼克斯队已经六连败了
Knicks have now lost six in a row.

1158
00:53:21,190 --> 00:53:24,090
尼克斯队的场上没有很好的化学反应
There's a chemistry problem there on the floor.

1159
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:28,170
他们需要一个控卫来分配球
They need a point guard to distribute the ball.

1160
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:30,170
{\i1}林书豪最初的两年合同{\i}
{\i1}Jeremy's original two-year contract{\i}

1161
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:31,700
{\i1}即将到期{\i}
{\i1}Was about to expire,{\i}

1162
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:33,700
{\i1}这意味着如果尼克斯队裁掉他{\i}
{\i1}Which meant that, if the knicks let him go,{\i}

1163
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:37,340
{\i1}他不仅得不到薪水，而且，将永远失去机会{\i1}
{\i1}He'd be dropped with no pay, and, this time, for good.{\i}

1164
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,110
在训练时，书豪站在我旁边
During practice, jeremy was standing right beside me

1165
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:43,800
{\pos(330,404)}麦克·德安东尼
尼克斯2008-2012主教练

1166
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:42,410
就站在场边
On the side of the court

1167
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:45,480
但没有加入训练
And not really get in even in practice.

1168
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:49,950
我们把他签下来只是
以防万一哪天有人受伤时顶替的
He was just there in case one of these guys got hurt.

1169
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:52,020
我已经隐约有预感了
I pretty much saw the writing on the wall.

1170
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,990
当时就想，“差不多就是这样了”
I was like, "I'm pretty much done,"

1171
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:55,730
我只能接受现实
And, like, I was resigned to the fact

1172
00:53:55,730 --> 00:53:57,630
我又要被裁了
That I was gonna get let go.

1173
00:53:57,630 --> 00:53:59,930
站在场边的时候，他走向我
Standing on the side of the court, he comes up to me,

1174
00:53:59,930 --> 00:54:02,000
他说，“嘿，教练，我有一个问题。”
And he goes, "hey, coach, I've got a question."

1175
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,370
我就说，“书豪，什么问题？”
I go, "what is it, jeremy?"

1176
00:54:03,370 --> 00:54:05,540
“我在这儿一直都是打出租车的”
"I'm taking a taxi everywhere.

1177
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:07,640
“我应该把我的车带过来吗？”
Should I ship my car out here?"

1178
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:13,210
当时他的反应是，“呃，也许不必”
And he was like, "uh, you know, probably not."

1179
00:54:13,210 --> 00:54:17,050
我当时就想，“完了，又要被裁了“
I was like, "oh, hell, I'm gonna get waived."

1180
00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:19,880
所以我就跟助教格兰说
And so I went and talked to glen.

1181
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:21,420
我说，“格兰，你怎么看？”
I said, "glen, what do you think?"

1182
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:22,650
他说，“其实我们还没有真正看过他打球”
And he goes, "well, we haven't really seen him.

1183
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:24,120
“我们不清楚”
We don't know."

1184
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:26,320
我说，“这样吧，我们就让他试试”
And I said, "you know what? Let me try to see

1185
00:54:26,330 --> 00:54:28,060
“如果周二之前让他试着打几场比赛”
"if we can get him in a couple games

1186
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:31,160
“看看会发生什么”
Before Tuesday and just see what happens."

1187
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:35,100
他们对我说，“今晚你要上场”
They're like, "look, you're gonna play tonight.

1188
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:38,700
“上场之后”
"I want you to go out there.

1189
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:41,240
“不希望你做太多事情”
I don't want you to do too much."

1190
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:44,710
我说，“好的，我不会的”
I was like, "okay, I won't."

1191
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:49,450
加内特已经得了8分
8 points for garnett.

1192
00:54:49,450 --> 00:54:52,180
林书豪丢球，布拉德利断球上篮得分
Lin coughs it up, bradley to the rim.

1193
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:53,850
我真的没有做很多事
I didn't do too much.

1194
00:54:53,850 --> 00:54:56,190
我几乎什么都没做，我的表现糟透了
I pretty much did nothing, and I played horrible.

1195
00:54:56,190 --> 00:54:57,820
投篮不中
You know, I missed shots,

1196
00:54:57,820 --> 00:54:59,690
又是失误，又是犯规
I had turnovers, I had bad fouls.

1197
00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:00,720


1198
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:02,730
林书豪犯规
Lin reached in.

1199
00:55:02,730 --> 00:55:04,060
我想，我最多还有一次机会
I thought, at most,

1200
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:05,730
就是下一场比赛
I had one more chance the next game.

1201
00:55:05,730 --> 00:55:09,270
我当时想，我刚刚搞砸了和波士顿的比赛
I was like, "okay, I just screwed the boston game.

1202
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:12,100
“也许我要被裁了”
"I probably will get cut,

1203
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,670
“但他们明天可能会再给我一次机会”
But they may give me one more chance tomorrow."

1204
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:17,880
我记得那时
I think at the time,

1205
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:20,580
书豪其实住在他纽约的哥哥那
Jeremy was actually staying with his brother in new york,

1206
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:22,410
而在飞机上他跟我说
And he was talking to me on the plane.

1207
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:26,330
{\pos(807,398)}兰德里·菲尔兹
后卫，尼克斯2010-2012

1208
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:23,710
今晚会有一些朋友在我哥那过夜
He's like, "you know, my brother, he's got some people over,

1209
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:26,880
所以，我可不可以
"um, so, you know, is it cool

1210
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:29,250
在你家睡一晚上？
If I crash at your place instead?"

1211
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:31,990
我说，“当然可以”
You know, I was like, "yeah, sure, man, you can come."

1212
00:55:31,990 --> 00:55:33,720
不过我也有提醒他
I was giving him forewarning, though,

1213
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:35,090
我的沙发不太大
That my couch wasn't huge.

1214
00:55:35,090 --> 00:55:36,630
那个沙发是租来的
It was actually a rental couch at the time.

1215
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:39,660
差不多只有六英尺（183厘米）长
It might have been maybe six feet long.

1216
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:43,230
我们大概凌晨2点才到
We get in at, like, 2:00 in the morning.

1217
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,940
我去了菲尔兹家
I go over to landry's place.

1218
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:47,240
他给我看了他的沙发
He's like, "this is my couch,"

1219
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:48,870
大概这么大
And his couch is like this big.

1220
00:55:48,870 --> 00:55:50,170
我当时就无语了
I'm like, "dude."

1221
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,040
我只能把头挂在沙发一头
I have my head hanging off of one end

1222
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,980
双脚挂在另外一头
And my legs hanging off the other.

1223
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:56,410
这样怎么能睡得好呢？
I'm like, "oh, my gosh, how am I gonna get a good night's rest?"

1224
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:57,820
明天还要打球
Like, "I might play tomorrow.

1225
00:55:57,820 --> 00:55:59,320
这也许是我最后的机会
This might be my last chance."

1226
00:56:01,390 --> 00:56:04,620
我记得当时对自己说
I remember thinking to myself,

1227
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:06,820
第一，我希望他能上场
One, I hope he gets in,

1228
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:09,590
因为他在波士顿的糟糕表现
Because he really didn't do enough in the boston game

1229
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:13,160
无法保证他有足够的上场时间
To warrant getting big minutes.

1230
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:17,070
第二，如果他上场，他必须有好的表现
And, two, if he gets in, he's gotta play well,

1231
00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:19,470
不然这场比赛过后他们就会裁了他
Or they're gonna release him after the game.

1232
00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:21,970
有趣的是
It's funny.

1233
00:56:21,970 --> 00:56:25,860
本赛季是上次停摆后11、12年内
This season was the only season in the
last, like, 11, 12 years since the last lockout

1234
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:29,320
唯一有连着三场背靠背的赛季
where people have played back-to-back-to-back games.

1235
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:34,310
而尼克斯队只有一次连着三场背靠背
And new york only had one stretch of back-to-back-to-back games.

1236
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,420
如果当时有更多休息时间
And if we had more days to rest,

1237
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:39,490
我不确定那场比赛我能否上场
I'm not sure if I would have been able to play in that game.

1238
00:56:42,290 --> 00:56:44,330
那天我祷告了
I prayed that day,

1239
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:47,430
我的祷告是
And my prayer is,

1240
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:52,070
“神啊，如果让他打NBA是你的意愿”
"god, if this is your will for him to play nba,

1241
00:56:52,070 --> 00:56:53,840
“那么你需要展现给他看”
You need to show it."

1242
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:56,110


1243
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:02,850
莫罗再次得分
There's morrow. Morrow knocks it down.

1244
00:57:02,850 --> 00:57:04,750
德隆投篮
Williams sets himself,

1245
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:06,480
三分命中
Puts up the 3, and knocks that one down.

1246
00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:10,150
尼克斯队已经落后10分了
The knicks find themselves down by 10 already.

1247
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:13,290
尼克斯队的山姆波特，个人第二次犯规
New york foul is on shumpert, his second.

1248
00:57:13,290 --> 00:57:15,330
看看谁要上场了
Again, mike, look who's coming in.

1249
00:57:15,330 --> 00:57:18,900
是林书豪，你可以听到球迷的大声欢呼
Jeremy lin, and you hear a pretty big ovation.

1250
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:39,580
他看起来没有犹豫
He didn't look tentative,

1251
00:57:39,590 --> 00:57:41,790
也没有过于忧虑
He didn't look overly concerned.

1252
00:57:41,790 --> 00:57:44,290
他看起来就像在说，“我要放手一搏了”
He looked like, "dude, I'm about to go do it.

1253
00:57:44,290 --> 00:57:46,460
如果他们裁了我就裁吧
"if they cut me, they cut me.

1254
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:49,690
就算我再也不能在NBA打球也无所谓了
"if I don't never play another nba game, so be it.

1255
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:52,730
我要让你们看看真正的林书豪是怎么打球的
I'm going to play like jeremy lin can play."

1256
00:57:55,670 --> 00:57:57,870
林书豪突破上篮
Jeremy lin drives and finishes.

1257
00:57:57,870 --> 00:58:00,140
漂亮的上篮得分
Nice play from lin.

1258
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:01,670
丢球了
There's a strip of it.

1259
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:03,870
林书豪长传给道格拉斯
Lin throws it ahead to toney douglas.

1260
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:06,340
擦板得分
Up for the layup! Banks it in!

1261
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:08,180
山姆波特杀过来了，传球给林
Here comes shumpert to lin.

1262
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:10,750
林上篮，球进了
Lin flips it up and puts it in.

1263
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:13,420
又是林书豪！
Jeremy lin once again!

1264
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:16,690
他的半场数据差不多是10+4+4
He finished the half with like 10, 4, and 4,

1265
00:58:16,690 --> 00:58:19,160
对半场来说很不错了
Like, good numbers for a half.

1266
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:22,590
超过了他之前所做的一切
That was such a higher high than, like, anything he's, like, done.

1267
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,960
我当时欣喜若狂
So I was, like, ecstatic at that point.

1268
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,970
而到了下半场，他简直
The second half, he just went...

1269
00:58:27,970 --> 00:58:29,370
简直疯了
He just went nuts.

1270
00:58:29,370 --> 00:58:30,930
（林书豪）突到篮下了，球又进了
Driving to the basket, does it again.

1271
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:34,300
同时有加罚的机会
He's got a chance for a 3-point play as he got hit.

1272
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:36,740
（林书豪）撞到佩特洛，又杀向篮筐了
Bumped by petro, gets to the rim.

1273
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:38,440
进球有效，还造成对手犯规
Count it and a foul!

1274
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:40,510
林书豪！
Jeremy lin!

1275
00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:42,710
他经历了美妙的一晚
He has in one special night

1276
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:43,780
成了（麦迪逊广场）花园的宠儿
Become a garden favorite.

1277
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:45,950
今晚会被人记住吗？
Will it be remembered?

1278
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:47,280
他连着做了
He was stringing together,

1279
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:48,750
三个胯下运球
Like, three crossover moves in a row.

1280
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:50,590
过去他从未这样做过
Like, things he's never done before.

1281
00:58:50,590 --> 00:58:52,160
（林书豪）再次撕开防守
Splits the defense again!

1282
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:54,220
杀到篮下了！上篮命中！
Gets to the rim! Pops it in!

1283
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:56,290
还造成犯规！哇！
And a foul! Wow!

1284
00:58:58,330 --> 00:59:00,130
球迷已经都坐不住了
And the crowd on their feet

1285
00:59:00,130 --> 00:59:01,700
站起来向这个男人致敬
Paying homage to this man.

1286
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:03,470
看起来连他的队友们
Clyde, even it looks like his teammates

1287
00:59:03,470 --> 00:59:05,500
也不相信所发生的一切
Don't believe what they're seeing.

1288
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:08,310
我当时太兴奋了
I was just so emotional.

1289
00:59:08,310 --> 00:59:10,440
现在他们不能把我裁掉了
There's no way they can cut me now.

1290
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:13,540
我刚刚打了生命中最重要的比赛
I just had the game of my life.

1291
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:15,550
又是一个胯下运球后杀向篮筐
Again, the crossover, the basket.

1292
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:17,880
投篮，又进了
Puts it up, pops it in!

1293
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:21,950
林书豪，25分！
Jeremy lin with 25!

1294
00:59:21,950 --> 00:59:24,720
球迷们已经疯狂了！
And this crowd is going crazy!

1295
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:27,020
尽情地突破，玩弄
Penetrating, manipulating,

1296
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:28,690
完全摧毁了篮网队
Devastating the nets!

1297
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:31,060
他是来自哈佛的英雄
He's the hero from harvard,

1298
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:32,600
尼克斯队终于
As the knicks

1299
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:35,700
拿到了一场亟需的胜利，这是他生命中最重要的比赛
Get a much-needed victory on the game of his life.

1300
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:38,970
他已经被兴奋的队友包围
And he is swarmed by his ecstatic teammates

1301
00:59:38,970 --> 00:59:42,010
还有麦迪逊广场花园兴奋的球迷
And a jubilant crowd here at madison square garden.

1302
00:59:42,010 --> 00:59:43,710
感谢神
I'm just thankful to god

1303
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:45,380
赐予我这次上场的机会
For this opportunity to be able to come out here

1304
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:47,410
来为这支球队打球
And play with this team and this organization.

1305
00:59:47,410 --> 00:59:49,880


1306
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:53,550
我洗了个澡
Man, I was taking a shower,

1307
00:59:53,550 --> 00:59:55,520
我甚至分不清
And I was like... I didn't even know.

1308
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:58,660
那是洗澡水
I was like, "is this water, like, from the shower,

1309
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:00,720
还是我流下的喜悦的泪水
Or am I actually crying, like, tears of joy?"

1310
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:04,630
我实在是太兴奋了
Oh, I was just, like, so high on emotion.

1311
01:00:04,630 --> 01:00:07,230
我太开心了，我就坐在浴室里
I was so happy. I was sitting in the shower,

1312
01:00:07,230 --> 01:00:09,430
脑子里在回放发展联盟里的那些时光
Replaying all the times in the d-league,

1313
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,800
那些我不得不经历的
All these flashbacks of these tough times

1314
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,100
艰苦岁月的片断
I had to go through.

1315
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:14,640
我记得我出来后
And I remember I got out,

1316
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:18,910
看到我的家人，他们都在微笑
I saw my family, and they were all smiling.

1317
01:00:18,910 --> 01:00:20,210
我打电话给经纪人
I called my agent,

1318
01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:22,650
他在对我大喊大叫
And he was yelling at me on the phone, you know, like,

1319
01:00:22,650 --> 01:00:25,220
他说，“我太为你骄傲了！我就知道你行的”
"I'm so proud of you. I knew you could do it."

1320
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:29,390
这就是我希望取得的突破
That was kind of like the much-needed breakthrough that I was hoping for.

1321
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:33,690
在林书豪取得对篮网队的惊艳表现之前
Before jeremy lin's first big game against new jersey,

1322
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:38,300
他根本不在尼克斯队的计划之内
He really wasn't in the knicks' plans at that point,

1323
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:39,860
据我所知
And I'm told they had begun

1324
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:43,830
他们当时已经考虑换掉他了
To look seriously at replacements.

1325
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:46,340
周六晚上的麦迪逊广场花园
Clyde, Saturday night, madison square garden

1326
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:49,070
和整个赛季一样人声鼎沸
Sounded as loud as we've heard it all season.

1327
01:00:49,070 --> 01:00:50,740
他无与伦比
He was magnificent.

1328
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:53,040
从尼克斯队的角度
You just hope from a knicks standpoint

1329
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:54,140
你会希望他能引领进攻
That he can run the offense

1330
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:56,080
保持周六那样的精彩表现
As well as he ran it on Saturday.

1331
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:59,250
第一次首发我其实没有特别紧张
I just really wasn't nervous for my first start.

1332
01:00:59,250 --> 01:01:01,450
通常来说，我应该会紧张
And, you know, usually, I would be,

1333
01:01:01,450 --> 01:01:04,790
但不知道为什么我感觉很舒服
But I don't know why I just felt really comfortable,

1334
01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:06,690
超出自然的平静
And it was just a supernatural peace,

1335
01:01:06,690 --> 01:01:09,260
这就是一些我无法解释的事情
And it's one of those things that, you know, I can't really explain.

1336
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:14,130
{\i1}林书豪的第一次NBA首发出场{\i}
{\i1}For jeremy's first nba start,{\i}

1337
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:16,770
{\i1}阿玛尔·斯塔德迈尔因个人原因缺阵{\i}
{\i1}Amar'e stoudemire was out for personal reasons,{\i}

1338
01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:19,940
{\i1}卡梅隆·安东尼上半场因伤下场{\i}
{\i1}And carmelo anthony suffered an injury in the first half.{\i}

1339
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:22,740
安东尼走路很艰难
Carmelo anthony comes up hobbling.

1340
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:24,110
他很难受
He's in a lot of discomfort.

1341
01:01:24,110 --> 01:01:25,980
他现在已经不能走路了
He can't move right now.

1342
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:28,410
{\i1}尼克斯队现在需要一位领袖{\i}
{\i1}The knicks desperately needed a leader,{\i}

1343
01:01:28,410 --> 01:01:30,580
{\i1}而林书豪将承担起这个使命{\i}
{\i1}And jeremy would answer the call.{\i}

1344
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:33,420
林书豪绕过杰弗森
Lin gets around jefferson,

1345
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:34,750
还在看人，上反篮得分
Looking, and backs it in.

1346
01:01:34,750 --> 01:01:37,020
上场比赛有不少这样的表现
He had a couple of those the other night.

1347
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:38,560
我们不断地打挡拆
We were running pick and roll

1348
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:39,860
一个挡拆接一个挡拆
After pick and roll after pick and roll.

1349
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:42,190
林书豪传给里面的杰弗里斯
Lin inside to jeffries!

1350
01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:43,990
我不知道他能否保持对篮网那场的表现
I didn't know how he would follow up, that new jersey game,

1351
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,430
因为那场实在太棒了
'Cause it was such a high,

1352
01:01:46,430 --> 01:01:49,130
但是（本场比赛）他不断上演各种夸张的上篮
But he just kept making ridiculous layups,

1353
01:01:49,130 --> 01:01:50,530
各种跳投命中
He was hitting jumpers.

1354
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:52,140
他们不了解我的打球习惯
They didn't know my tendencies,

1355
01:01:52,140 --> 01:01:53,870
他们不知道我的弱点
They didn't know my weak spots,

1356
01:01:53,870 --> 01:01:55,570
也不知道我的优势和最佳投篮点
My strong spots, my sweet spots.

1357
01:01:55,570 --> 01:01:57,040
林书豪突进来了
Lin on the drive,

1358
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:58,540
拉杆，命中！
Flips it up, drops it in!

1359
01:01:58,540 --> 01:02:00,580
同时造成犯规！好一个反手上篮！
And a foul! Reverse layup!

1360
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:02,050
他们从未看过我打球
They had never seen me play.

1361
01:02:02,050 --> 01:02:04,920
向前推进，传给山姆波特，又回传给林书豪
Pushing it, ahead to shumpert, back to lin.

1362
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:08,950
林被打到了，球还是放进，2+1！
Lin gets hit, puts it in, and a foul!

1363
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:11,350
上篮
Lays it up, puts it up,

1364
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:12,620
还是活球
Chandler keeps it alive.

1365
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:14,390
林必须得投了
lin has to put it up.

1366
01:02:14,390 --> 01:02:18,460
在进攻24秒结束前三分命中
A 3-pointer as the shot clock expired!

1367
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:20,330
我像压榨秘书似的使用他
I'm riding him like friggin' secretariat.

1368
01:02:23,070 --> 01:02:24,300
林书豪
Jeremy lin

1369
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:26,900
连续两个职业生涯的重要夜晚
With his second consecutive career night.

1370
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:30,540
他现在是尼克斯队新的首发控卫
He is the new starting point guard of the knicks.

1371
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:35,510
尼克斯队再次取胜
And the knicks win again.

1372
01:02:35,510 --> 01:02:37,980
全场观众起立向林书豪致敬
A standing ovation for jeremy lin.

1373
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:47,860
过程中有非常多细微的因素
You know, there's so many little variables

1374
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:51,500
是我无法掌控的
With every step of the way being something I can't control.

1375
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:54,200
比如，休斯顿火箭队晚了一天才裁掉我
You know, houston waives me a day late.

1376
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,830
如果他们早一天裁掉我
If they waive me a day earlier,

1377
01:02:55,830 --> 01:02:58,440
就会超过裁人的线
I would have been past the waiver wire.

1378
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:00,740
那天早上山姆波特正好受伤
Shumpert gets hurt that morning.

1379
01:03:00,740 --> 01:03:02,140
尼克斯队才选了我
The knicks pick me up,

1380
01:03:02,140 --> 01:03:04,170
因为去年他们试训过我
Because they had worked me out the year before.

1381
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:07,810
正好，尼克斯队的主教练是德安东尼
You know, it happens to be d'antoni who's coaching here

1382
01:03:07,810 --> 01:03:09,810
他的进攻体系就像是为我量身打造的
Whose offense is tailor-made for me.

1383
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:11,950
突然之间，一切都变得疯狂了
And all of a sudden, things just go crazy.

1384
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:15,890
过去两场他平均得分26.5分
He's averaging 26 1/2 points a game the last two games.

1385
01:03:15,890 --> 01:03:17,550
我认为这不可持续
I don't think that's gonna continue.

1386
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,490
这显然无法持续
Obviously, that's not gonna continue.

1387
01:03:20,690 --> 01:03:22,760
接着我们踏上客场之旅，前往华盛顿
Then we hit the road and go to washington,

1388
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:25,100
又将遇上约翰·沃尔
And it's like john wall again, you know.

1389
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:27,700
夏季联赛的时候我和沃尔交过手
Like, I played against john wall in the summer league,

1390
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:30,230
现在狭路相逢
And now it's, like, a rematch.

1391
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,570
又要和他对位
Now I'm playing against him again.

1392
01:03:32,570 --> 01:03:35,140
呜~
Ooh!

1393
01:03:36,670 --> 01:03:38,640
林书豪突破到禁区内
Lin on the drive, gets inside.

1394
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:42,180
林书豪反手上篮，漂亮！
Reverse layup. Great play by jeremy lin.

1395
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:43,650
沃尔杀过来了，看着
Here comes wall. Look at wall.

1396
01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:44,850
撕开防守
Breaks the press,

1397
01:03:44,850 --> 01:03:47,280
左手暴扣
And throws it down with the left hand!

1398
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:51,050
我当时的反应是，靠，他居然在我头上扣篮
I was like, "dang, he kinda dunked on my head."

1399
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:53,890
我必须还以颜色！
I was like, "I'm gonna try to get him back."

1400
01:03:53,890 --> 01:03:56,560
几个回合过后，他们的防守出了问题
Couple possessions later, they messed up their coverage,

1401
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:57,990
我轻松地突进去
I had a free lane,

1402
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,730
就试着去扣扣篮
And I just tried to take the rim down.

1403
01:03:59,730 --> 01:04:02,030
林书豪突破！
Lin drives!

1404
01:04:02,030 --> 01:04:03,830
这才是你说的扣篮
There's the dunk you're talking about, clyde.

1405
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,640
林书豪点燃球迷的激情
Jeremy lin fires up the crowd.

1406
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:08,100
我看到这么大的空当
When I saw that opening,

1407
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:11,880
我只是用尽全力去完成那记扣篮
I just tried to dunk it as hard as I could.

1408
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:14,850
我不知道
I don't know. There's just...

1409
01:04:14,850 --> 01:04:19,380
只是有太多的痛苦和磨炼
There's been so much pain and so many trying times,

1410
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:20,780
现在终于能打上球了
And now that I get to play,

1411
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:22,650
我只是想把这些都宣泄出来
I'm just letting it all out, man.

1412
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:24,550
把一切都宣泄在球场上
I'm just letting it all out on the floor.

1413
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:27,660
比赛过后，当我回想时
After the game, I just look back,

1414
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:30,490
觉得很有趣
And I'm like, "man, that was so fun."

1415
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:31,600
一个美妙的故事正在酝酿，主角是林书豪
The great story that's brewing is jeremy lin,

1416
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:32,930


1417
01:04:32,930 --> 01:04:34,800
他本年度的合同算是有保证了
And this week, contracts are guaranteed for the rest of the year.

1418
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:35,970


1419
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:39,000
他的球场表现就像在说，“让他的价值充分展现”
（电影《甜心先生》的台词）
He's been balling out, saying, "show that man his money."

1420
01:04:39,070 --> 01:04:39,170


1421
01:04:39,170 --> 01:04:41,340
有一点可以肯定，他在场上的视野很好
The things that's for real is his vision,

1422
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:42,570
这不会变
Which won't change,

1423
01:04:42,570 --> 01:04:44,070
他的速度不会变
His speed, which won't change,

1424
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:46,480
他对比赛的认知不会变
His knowledge of the game, which won't change.

1425
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:47,980
我就是觉得不会变
I just don't see it changing.

1426
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:50,010
请不要再引用我的话了
Now, again, please don't quote me on that one.

1427
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:51,380
肯尼·史密斯：现在他该出现在球探报告里了
Kenny Smith: Now he's on the scouting report.

1428
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:53,020
沙奎尔·奥尼尔： 是的，当然
Shaquille o'neal: Yeah, he is now.

1429
01:04:53,020 --> 01:04:54,650
我们来看看他是否在洛杉矶湖人队的球探报告里
Let's see if he's in the scouting report for the lakers

1430
01:04:54,650 --> 01:04:57,750
没错，周五晚上，关注麦迪逊广场花园
Oh, yeah, he is. On Friday night at the garden.

1431
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:04,560
过去两周我就是睡这里的
This is basically where I lived the last two weeks

1432
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:07,560
睡在这张沙发上
And so it's the couch I slept on.

1433
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:10,470
我的哥哥和大嫂
Uh, my brother and sister-in-law,

1434
01:05:10,470 --> 01:05:14,300
好好地招待了我
Uh, did a good job of hosting me.

1435
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:15,370
很开心
Had a lot of fun.

1436
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:16,810


1437
01:05:16,810 --> 01:05:19,710
现在他们的小弟弟就要搬出去了
And now their little kid might have to move out.

1438
01:05:19,710 --> 01:05:20,940


1439
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:22,810
如果我现在不洗衣服
If I don't do laundry now,

1440
01:05:22,810 --> 01:05:24,850
那我结婚了也不会洗，没错
I won't do laundry when I'm married. Fact.

1441
01:05:24,850 --> 01:05:26,580
大嫂：你们脏死了
Sister-in-law:You guys are brats.

1442
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:28,020
我们会做别的事情
So? We do other things.

1443
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:29,420


1444
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:30,950
大嫂：比如？
Sister-in-law: Like what?

1445
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:31,990


1446
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:33,760
什么比如不比如的
What do you mean, like what?

1447
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:36,690
你应该问有什么是我们不做的
Like, what don't we do, is the question.

1448
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:37,860
大嫂：那你会做什么？
Sister-in-law: What do you do?

1449
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:39,430
妈妈： {\i1}你 {\i}会做什么？
Shirley: What do {\i1}you{\i} do?

1450
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:40,630
我每天都午睡
I take a nap every day.

1451
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:41,900
妈妈：是的，这个我了解
Shirley: Yeah, that I know.

1452
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:43,770
没有很多人能做到这个
Who does that? Not many people can.

1453
01:05:43,770 --> 01:05:45,340
没有很多人可以
Not many people can.

1454
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:46,470
你还是个吃货
And you eat a lot,

1455
01:05:46,470 --> 01:05:49,140
一天到晚吃个不停
Nonstop all day long. Yeah.

1456
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:51,010
昨天，总经理跟我说
Yesterday, the general manager was like,

1457
01:05:51,010 --> 01:05:53,740
书豪，你的合同有保障了
"hey, jeremy, by the way, you're guaranteed now,

1458
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:55,680
不要睡沙发了
So get off the couch."

1459
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:58,850
我......
I was like...

1460
01:05:58,850 --> 01:06:01,080
妈妈：他其实有地方住
Shirley: This guy has a place to stay,

1461
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:03,290
但是他不想住那
But he doesn't want to stay there.

1462
01:06:03,290 --> 01:06:04,790
只想赖在这里
He want to crash in here.

1463
01:06:04,790 --> 01:06:06,590
他们可不想这个上新闻
They don't want this to be on the news,

1464
01:06:06,590 --> 01:06:09,130
林书豪睡在他哥哥的沙发上
Jeremy sleeping on the couch at his brother's.

1465
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:10,790
为什么？
Why?

1466
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,300
这太疯狂了
It's crazy.

1467
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:14,160
太疯狂了
It's just crazy to...

1468
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:16,630
告诉你吧，我的社交网络，我的手机
I'm telling you, social media, Twitter, facebook, my phone, it's just...

1469
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:19,000


1470
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:22,970
我不知道还能不能更疯狂
I don't know if it could get crazier than this.

1471
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:25,740
我真的不知道
Like, I really don't.

1472
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:26,880
林书豪？
Jeremy lin?

1473
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:28,040
有听说过吗？
Are you following that story at all?

1474
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:30,050
不知道，听过一下
No idea. I know who he is,

1475
01:06:30,050 --> 01:06:31,450
但我真的不太清楚状况
But I don't really know what's going on too much with that.

1476
01:06:31,450 --> 01:06:32,850
你对林书豪过去一周的表现感到震惊吗？
Are you surprised at the production that lin's had over the past week?

1477
01:06:32,850 --> 01:06:34,150


1478
01:06:34,150 --> 01:06:35,990
我还不知道他做过什么
I don't even know what he's done.

1479
01:06:35,990 --> 01:06:40,120
根本就不知道你们说的是哪个人
Like, I have no idea which you guys are talking about.

1480
01:06:40,130 --> 01:06:42,130


1481
01:06:42,130 --> 01:06:44,260
我看了一些报道
I'm reading all these quotes

1482
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:45,830
关于他（科比）说了什么
About what he's saying.

1483
01:06:45,830 --> 01:06:48,400
“科比完全不知道林书豪是何人”
"kobe bryant has no idea who jeremy lin is."

1484
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:49,970
我的反应是，“什么”？
I'm like, "what?"

1485
01:06:51,870 --> 01:06:53,270
我在想，“你为什么要这么说”
I'm like, "why would you do that?

1486
01:06:53,270 --> 01:06:54,670
“我完全没有谈论你”
"I didn't say anything about you.

1487
01:06:54,670 --> 01:06:57,610
“从没说过你的坏话”
I never talked bad about you."

1488
01:06:57,610 --> 01:06:59,540
所以听说这件事时，我心想……
So when I heard that, I was like...

1489
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:00,710


1490
01:07:00,710 --> 01:07:01,950
“球场上见”
"here we go."

1491
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:06,150
你会单防他吗？
Would you consider guarding him

1492
01:07:06,150 --> 01:07:08,180
如果他的表现很好？
If he's having one of those games?

1493
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:09,320


1494
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:11,420
你们不要着急
Let's not get ahead of ourselves here.

1495
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:15,730
加油！
Let's go!

1496
01:07:15,730 --> 01:07:17,290
新的英雄已经出现
There is a new man in town.

1497
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:19,430
狭路相逢勇者胜
"may the best man lin(win)."

1498
01:07:19,430 --> 01:07:23,230
今晚的竞猜，林书豪能否超过23分
Over-under, 23 points for lin tonight, bomani.

1499
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:25,740
对手是内线长人如林的湖人队
Against the lakers with those trees they've got inside?

1500
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:27,900
今晚不会有那么多林疯狂时刻了
It won't be so linsane tonight.

1501
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:30,970
今晚谁得分高？科比还是林书豪？
Kobe or lin? Who scores more tonight?

1502
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:33,680
我选林书豪，我的英雄
I'm going with my guy, jeremy lin, my hero.

1503
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:34,910


1504
01:07:34,910 --> 01:07:37,180
因为他无所不“林”
Because all he does is lin, baby!

1505
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:39,820
短短一周
Jeremy lin in just one week

1506
01:07:39,820 --> 01:07:41,250
林书豪就改变了一切
Has turned things around

1507
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:43,650
无论对他自己还是尼克斯队来说
For his career and for the new york knicks.

1508
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:46,260
我爱林书豪，太棒了！
I love it! It's awesome, man!

1509
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:48,690
这是纽约发生过最美妙的事情
This is like the greatest thing that's happened to new york ever.

1510
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:49,860
就是这么一个夜晚
It's one of those nights,

1511
01:07:49,860 --> 01:07:51,090
一个故事
And it's one of those stories

1512
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:54,030
让我们知道为何如此热爱体育
Where it really is why we love sports.

1513
01:07:54,030 --> 01:07:56,270
我不知道结果会怎样
I didn't know how it was gonna turn out,

1514
01:07:56,270 --> 01:07:57,600
但是
But I was like,

1515
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:59,300
我将非常非常具有攻击性
"I'm just gonna be really, really aggressive."

1516
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:09,510
我们的比赛进行得很顺利，投篮都弹无虚发
Everything was going well, everything was going down.

1517
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:16,020
林书豪跳投，命中！
Lin puts it up, puts it in!

1518
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:18,890
完美的开局
Terrific start!

1519
01:08:18,890 --> 01:08:21,860
听听球迷的欢呼吧！
And listen to this garden crowd.

1520
01:08:21,860 --> 01:08:25,530
我记最让我激动不已的是
I think the one thing where I kind of lost it a little bit,

1521
01:08:25,530 --> 01:08:26,660


1522
01:08:26,670 --> 01:08:28,800
看着他带球，突然急停转身
He'd come down, he kind of like stutter-stepped, and spun

1523
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:31,600
手指很柔软地轻轻一投
And finger-rolled it.

1524
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:32,940
林喜欢这个大空当
Lin likes the open floor.

1525
01:08:32,940 --> 01:08:34,640
转身，投篮，命中！
Spinning, puts it up and puts it in!

1526
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:37,940
林书豪，超级精彩的得分
Sensational play for jeremy lin!

1527
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:41,440
整个球馆都沸腾了，在这样一个全国瞩目的舞台
The garden erupted, and to do it on the national stage,

1528
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:45,380
任何人看过之后都永生难忘
Anybody who saw that moment will never forget.

1529
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:48,280
又一次点燃了麦迪逊广场花园
Electrifying the garden again!

1530
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:50,050
他已经得了18分了
He's got 18 points.

1531
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:55,830
欢迎来到演播室，这是林书豪的半场个人表演
Welcome to our studios for the jeremy lin toyota halftime show.

1532
01:08:55,830 --> 01:08:57,930
林书豪是顶级的

1533
01:08:57,930 --> 01:08:59,660
投篮12中7

1534
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:01,300
拿下18分5次助攻
18 points, 5 assists.

1535
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:03,700
科比和他的队友的投篮手感还很差
Kobe bryant and the lakers struggling shooting the ball,

1536
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:05,500
但现在他们还只落后8分
But they're only down by 8.

1537
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:07,300
科比，一系列假动作
Bryant, a couple of fakes,

1538
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:10,770
要投篮了，球进了
Gonna put it up, and knocks it down.

1539
01:09:10,780 --> 01:09:13,180
林书豪抢断
Stripped by lin, stolen by lin.

1540
01:09:13,180 --> 01:09:16,910
助攻左侧的山姆波特，左手上篮命中！
Left side, shumpert, left-handed layup!

1541
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:20,680
科比转身，高难度的一球
Bryant spinning, difficult shot.

1542
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:22,290


1543
01:09:22,290 --> 01:09:24,390
又是科比
Kobe bryant again.

1544
01:09:24,390 --> 01:09:27,460
他要开始接管比赛了
He is starting to get in one of those zones right now.

1545
01:09:29,890 --> 01:09:32,360
加索尔在防守林书豪
Gasol is on lin.

1546
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:34,930
一个两分球，进了！
Puts up the 2-pointer. Puts it in!

1547
01:09:34,930 --> 01:09:37,330
林书豪31分！
Jeremy lin with 31!

1548
01:09:39,770 --> 01:09:41,440
杰弗里斯抢下篮板

1549
01:09:42,870 --> 01:09:44,570
林书豪三分
Lin for 3.

1550
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:45,610
梆！
Bang!

1551
01:09:45,610 --> 01:09:48,010
三分命中
3-pointer!

1552
01:09:48,010 --> 01:09:52,220
林书豪！
Jeremy lin!

1553
01:09:52,220 --> 01:09:54,980
我整年最喜欢的一次得分
And my favorite play of this whole year

1554
01:09:54,990 --> 01:09:56,990
就是那个底脚的三分
Was when I hit that 3 in the corner

1555
01:09:56,990 --> 01:09:59,960
因为那场比赛有太多的渲染
Just because that game had so much hype,

1556
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:03,290
那记投篮就像一把匕首
And that shot was kind of the dagger

1557
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:05,860
狠狠地给了他们一刀
That put the game out of reach for them.

1558
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:08,100
本赛季两次被裁
Already cut twice this season,

1559
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:11,060
因为无处可去而只能睡在队友的沙发上
Sleeping on a teammate's couch, because he had nowhere else to go,

1560
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:14,740
而一夜之间，他成了曼哈顿的宠儿
And, suddenly, jeremy lin is the toast of manhattan.

1561
01:10:14,740 --> 01:10:16,040
就在这里
This is it right here.

1562
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:17,210
这就是我的梦想
This is my dream, and, uh,

1563
01:10:17,210 --> 01:10:19,010
我感谢神
I'm just thankful to god, man,

1564
01:10:19,010 --> 01:10:21,580
让我美梦成真
Because this is my dream being lived out,

1565
01:10:21,580 --> 01:10:23,250
我无比感恩
And I'm so thankful for that.

1566
01:10:23,250 --> 01:10:25,880
林书豪38分
Jeremy lin, 38 points.

1567
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:28,650
本赛季尼克斯队球员的得分新高
It's the most by a knick this season.

1568
01:10:28,650 --> 01:10:33,020
“林疯狂”还在麦迪逊广场花园继续
Linsanity continues here in madison square garden.

1569
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:34,360
这真的难以形容
It's indescribable, really.

1570
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:36,560
我从未见过这样的事情
It's something I've never seen before.

1571
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:37,760
我没有预料到
I didn't foresee this coming.

1572
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:40,360
难以置信
You know, it's unbelievable.

1573
01:10:40,370 --> 01:10:42,570
我这人会很奇怪
This is, like, how weird I am.

1574
01:10:42,570 --> 01:10:44,630
我当时想这场比赛之后我要出口气
I was like, "I'm gonna go off this game,"

1575
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:47,540
采访结束时，他们肯定会问我
And at the end of the interview, they're gonna be like,

1576
01:10:47,540 --> 01:10:49,410
你觉得科比现在认识你了吗？
"oh, so do you think kobe knows who you are now?"

1577
01:10:49,410 --> 01:10:51,980
书豪，你知道肯定有个人会问你这个问题
Jeremy, you knew somebody was gonna ask you this,

1578
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:54,110
你认为科比现在认识你了吗？
But do you think kobe knows who you are now?

1579
01:10:54,110 --> 01:10:55,580
如果他们问我那个问题
If they ask me that question,

1580
01:10:55,580 --> 01:10:57,350
我的回答会是，“科比？谁啊？”
I'm gonna be like, "who the hell is kobe?"

1581
01:10:57,350 --> 01:10:58,920
我本想这样回答
That's what I was gonna say.

1582
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:01,550
但我想了一会儿
And then I, like, thought about it,

1583
01:11:01,550 --> 01:11:03,020
祷告的时候
And I prayed about it,

1584
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:04,620
想想神会怎么做呢？
I was like, you know, "what would jesus do?"

1585
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:06,760
不，神应该不会这么说
And I'm like, "jesus probably wouldn't say that,"

1586
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:09,630
所以我要改变我的答案
So I was like, "I'm gonna change my answer."

1587
01:11:09,630 --> 01:11:13,000
“这得问科比本人了”
Aw, well, you guys have to ask kobe.

1588
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,630
我不知道
I don't know.

1589
01:11:14,630 --> 01:11:18,000
让我们来看看当今体育界最大的新闻：林书豪
Let's get to what matters in sports today, jeremy lin.

1590
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,570
林书豪现在是纽约的第一巨星
Right now, the biggest star in new york is jeremy lin.

1591
01:11:20,570 --> 01:11:22,040
就算你不关注体育也一定听过他的故事
I don't even think you have to
be a sports fan to hear about this story.

1592
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:23,240


1593
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:26,210
“林旋风”横扫纽约全城
New york has a raging case of linsanity.

1594
01:11:26,210 --> 01:11:29,610
现在是疯狂的时刻
That's what it is right now. It's madness right now.

1595
01:11:29,610 --> 01:11:30,610
林书豪
Jeremy lin!

1596
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:32,120
无所不“林”
All I do is lin, lin, lin.

1597
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:35,550
你觉得怎么样？
What do you think?

1598
01:11:35,550 --> 01:11:37,020
你觉得现在的一切如何？
What do you think about all this?

1599
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:39,290
疯狂，太疯狂了
Um, it's crazy. It's just crazy.

1600
01:11:39,290 --> 01:11:40,920
现在体育界最大的头条
One of the biggest headlines

1601
01:11:40,930 --> 01:11:43,330
就是“林疯狂”
In sports right now is linsanity.

1602
01:11:43,330 --> 01:11:45,160
你还没听说过他？你会的
If you haven't caught it yet, you will.

1603
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:48,200
“林疯狂”席卷纽约城
Linsanity takes new york by storm.

1604
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:50,270
他实在是尼克斯队没有办法的办法了
He was a last-ditch effort for the knicks.

1605
01:11:50,270 --> 01:11:52,300
当时的情况可能是，有人说，“今晚谁想上场吗？”
They sort of said, "all right, who wants to play?"

1606
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:54,770
他举起了手，然后就有人说，“那好，你上吧”
And he raised his hand and, "all right, get in there."

1607
01:11:54,770 --> 01:11:57,040
我这么多年报道体育以来前所未闻的事情
I have never seen anything like this in all my years of covering sports.

1608
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:59,580


1609
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:01,640
从为见过一个人从默默无闻
I've never seen somebody go from a no-name

1610
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:03,980
在两周之内成为一个轰动的现象
To an absolute phenomenon inside of two weeks.

1611
01:12:03,980 --> 01:12:05,550
太难以置信了
It's unbelievable.

1612
01:12:05,550 --> 01:12:09,620
他有魅力、有型、有天赋
He's doing it with charisma, with style, with flair,

1613
01:12:09,620 --> 01:12:12,260
而且，他还打得很开心
And he's having fun.

1614
01:12:12,260 --> 01:12:13,920
这很疯狂，火得不行
It's crazy. It's catching fire.

1615
01:12:13,930 --> 01:12:16,130
我觉得“林疯狂”这个词
Linsanity, I think it'll probably be

1616
01:12:16,130 --> 01:12:18,030
将会收录到下一版的字典里
In the dictionary in the next version.

1617
01:12:18,030 --> 01:12:19,760
林疯狂？我爱林疯狂

1618
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:22,070
我爱林疯狂，我为他感到高兴
I love linsanity. I'm so happy for him.

1619
01:12:22,070 --> 01:12:23,630
林书豪（过去三场）得了89分
Jeremy lin's 89 points,

1620
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:28,400
这是所有球员自NBA和ABA合并以来
职业生涯前三场首发合计最高分
The most by any player in his first
three pro starts since the aba-nba merger.

1621
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:31,040
传给外面的林，林面对里德诺胯下运球
Outside to lin, crosses over ridnour,

1622
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:32,180
投篮命中
And hits.

1623
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:34,480
林书豪空中连线菲尔兹

1624
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:37,250
林迅速杀到篮下
Lin a whirling dervish right to the rim,

1625
01:12:37,250 --> 01:12:39,120
左右腾挪完成上篮
Zigzagging to the cup.

1626
01:12:40,250 --> 01:12:42,350
尼克斯队又取得一场胜利
The knicks have stolen one.

1627
01:12:42,350 --> 01:12:47,160
赛季最长的五连胜
It's their fifth straight win, their longest of the season.

1628
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:49,060
您已经不是哈佛最有名的毕业生了
You have been surpassed as the most
famous person who is a harvard graduate.

1629
01:12:49,060 --> 01:12:50,560


1630
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:52,530
我其实比你们更早知道林书豪
I knew about jeremy before you did.

1631
01:12:52,530 --> 01:12:54,160
您的意思是“林疯狂”也有您的功劳？
Are you taking credit for linsanity?

1632
01:12:54,170 --> 01:12:55,330
我觉得您有点这个意思
It kind of feels like you are a little bit.

1633
01:12:55,330 --> 01:12:56,600
我并没有功劳
I can't take credit for it,

1634
01:12:56,600 --> 01:13:00,700
我的意思只是，我比你们更早认识了他
But I'm just saying I was there early.

1635
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:04,140
如你所说，这是很棒的故事
As you said, it's a great story.

1636
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:07,410
对你来说，哪一部分最棒？
What's the greatest part in it for you?

1637
01:13:07,410 --> 01:13:08,810
我们取得五连胜
That we've won five in a row.

1638
01:13:08,810 --> 01:13:10,050


1639
01:13:10,050 --> 01:13:11,350
对我个人来说是这样
That's it for me.

1640
01:13:11,350 --> 01:13:13,520
所有的一切
Uh, just everything,

1641
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:16,390
这就是体育的魅力
Just here's just what's right with sports.

1642
01:13:16,390 --> 01:13:18,690
从默默无闻到一举成名
He's an underdog that came up.

1643
01:13:18,690 --> 01:13:19,960
他很好地做到了
He does it the right way.

1644
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:21,890
他够格打NBA吗？当然，毫无疑问
Can he play in the nba? Yeah, of course.

1645
01:13:21,890 --> 01:13:24,260
他全面，打得也很好
He's got all the tools, and he's playing really well.

1646
01:13:24,260 --> 01:13:26,700
那不是侥幸，他有实力
That's not a fluke, how he's playing.

1647
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:30,500
当时场边有个人
I had this one dude courtside

1648
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:32,440
整场比赛都在对我大吼大叫
Who was just yelling at me the whole game.

1649
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:34,370
“你只能持续一周罢了”
He's like, "you're a one-week wonder."

1650
01:13:34,370 --> 01:13:37,340
“这场比赛你就会输了，你逊毙了”
You know, "you're not gonna win this game. You suck."

1651
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:40,840
我们那场打得很糟糕
We were playing bad.

1652
01:13:40,850 --> 01:13:42,350
全队都很疲惫
We were tired, and I was like,

1653
01:13:42,350 --> 01:13:45,280
“这将是一场艰难的比赛”
"man, this is gonna be a tough one to pull out."

1654
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:47,820
比赛剩一分钟时我们还落后五分
We were down 5 with a minute left.

1655
01:13:47,820 --> 01:13:49,920
那是一次关键的抢断
You know, we got this huge steal,

1656
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:51,790
扣篮，还落后三分
Layup, down 3.

1657
01:13:53,190 --> 01:13:56,190
他们进攻没打成，我们有喘息的机会
They're coming down, we get a stop.

1658
01:13:56,190 --> 01:13:58,200
阿米尔·约翰逊那个加罚球
The and-1 at amir johnson

1659
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:01,260
拉平了比分，他个人已有5个盖帽
who I believe had 5 blocks to that point, ties the game.

1660
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:03,100
林书豪假投三分，改为突破
Lin fakes the 3, drives,

1661
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:04,230
突进去上篮了
Goes in for the layup,

1662
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:06,170
球进了，还造成犯规！
It's good, and a foul!

1663
01:14:06,170 --> 01:14:10,070
林书豪有机会通过罚球扳平比分
Lin can tie it with a free throw.

1664
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:11,670
当时球没进
They come down, missed shot,

1665
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:14,410
我们拿到球，比赛差不多还有20秒
And now we got the ball with, like, 20 seconds left.

1666
01:14:14,410 --> 01:14:15,910
林传给山姆波特
Lin to shumpert,

1667
01:14:15,910 --> 01:14:17,550
山姆波特跳投
Shumpert, pull-up jump shot.

1668
01:14:17,550 --> 01:14:19,550
没进，钱德勒抢到篮板
Won't go, Chandler the rebound.

1669
01:14:19,550 --> 01:14:22,020
尼克斯队将耗尽时间，完成最后一投
And the knicks will hold it for the final shot

1670
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:24,890
24秒进攻倒计时已经关闭
As the 24-second clock is shut off.

1671
01:14:26,460 --> 01:14:29,060
德安东尼没有叫暂停
Mike d'antoni won't call time out

1672
01:14:29,060 --> 01:14:31,190
猛龙队做好了防守准备
And let the raptors set up their d.

1673
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:34,560
加拿大航空中心的观众都站起来了
The crowd on its feet here at the air canada centre.

1674
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,470
林书豪跳投
Lin puts it up.

1675
01:14:38,470 --> 01:14:40,070
梆！！
Bang!

1676
01:14:40,070 --> 01:14:42,410
林书豪，三分命中！
Jeremy lin from downtown,

1677
01:14:42,410 --> 01:14:43,910
尼克斯队取得领先！
And the knicks take the lead!

1678
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:50,280
太惊人了！
Amazing here at the air canada centre!

1679
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:52,880
只剩10秒钟，所有人都站起来了
10 seconds, everyone standing,

1680
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:54,480
全场有2万人
20,000 in toronto.

1681
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:56,250
拉开拉开！
Get out of his way!

1682
01:14:56,250 --> 01:14:59,360
让他单挑卡尔德隆！
Let him just take calderon himself!

1683
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:01,190
还剩3秒钟，林书豪有身高优势
Three seconds, lin sizes him up,

1684
01:15:01,190 --> 01:15:03,660
干拔三分命中！
Straightaway 3, buries it!

1685
01:15:03,660 --> 01:15:05,330
只留下0.5秒钟
.5 remaining!

1686
01:15:05,330 --> 01:15:07,600
“林疯狂”还在继续！
Linsanity continues!

1687
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:09,230
我对结果很满意
I'm just glad it went like this,

1688
01:15:09,230 --> 01:15:11,600
让林疯狂能够稍微冷却一点
So we can calm the linsanity down a little bit.

1689
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:13,340


1690
01:15:13,340 --> 01:15:14,240
我们无法阻挡
Where we couldn't get a stop...

1691
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:15,840


1692
01:15:19,580 --> 01:15:21,740
我梦寐以求的，就是投进这样的制胜球
That's all I dream about is hitting the game winner

1693
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:24,280
再摆出搞怪的动作
And then doing some cool little dorky pose

1694
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:25,820
然后帅气地走回去
And then walking off.

1695
01:15:25,820 --> 01:15:29,090
像我小时候那样
You know, that's, like, all I did growing up.

1696
01:15:29,090 --> 01:15:30,320
我一直想这么做

1697

想知道那是什么感觉
I wanted to know what that felt like.

1698
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:35,120
他有能力
He's got the game,

1699
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:38,030
他态度很好，他很拉风

1701
01:15:39,060 --> 01:15:40,160


1702

谢谢你们
Okay. "thank you for being..."

1703

或者我直接开始第一部分？

1704
01:15:43,170 --> 01:15:44,270
可以
Yeah. Okay.

天啊
Oh, man.

1715

完美

As you said, unflappable,

1729
01:17:03,820 --> 01:17:05,680
如果还要挑刺的话
（chink in the armor：俗语，带有对中国人的嘲讽意味）
But if there is a chink in the armor,

1730
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:07,750
他还应该在哪些方面提高？
Where can lin improve his game?

1731
01:17:08,550 --> 01:17:10,050
Chink in the armor...

1732
01:17:10,050 --> 01:17:11,590
a chink in the armor...

1733
01:17:11,590 --> 01:17:13,120
很强壮，臂展很长
Nice build, he's got long arms.

1734
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:14,390
这是一个合格控卫需要具备的
That's what you need as a point guard.

1735
01:17:14,390 --> 01:17:15,630
他实在是
And he's really, I mean...

1736
01:17:15,630 --> 01:17:18,290
他的眼神呢？（暗讽亚洲人的眼睛小）
What about his eyes?

1737
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:19,400
迷离
Dreamy.

1738
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:21,400
他的视野很好
He has great court vision.

1739
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:23,300
如果不用Lin做双关语
Take away the lin puns...Mm-hmm.

1740
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:25,640
结果是这样的
This is what you end up with.

1741
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:27,240
令人惊“亚”
{\i1}（"Amasian": amazing和asian的合体）{\i}
"amasian."

1742
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:28,340
这......
now is that even...now is that even...

1743
01:17:28,340 --> 01:17:29,870
这合法吗？
now is that even...Is that even legal?

1744
01:17:29,870 --> 01:17:33,510
是的，这是林书豪
Jeremy lin. Yes, that's real.

1745
01:17:33,510 --> 01:17:36,110
他是从幸运饼干里蹦出来的
（幸运饼干：美国中餐厅常见食品）
Jeremy lin coming out of a fortune cookie.

1746
01:17:36,110 --> 01:17:38,810
这一切证明我们是多么措手不及
This whole thing has shown how unprepared

1747
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:41,950
来面对这种文化
We were to deal with this culture in this context.

1748
01:17:41,950 --> 01:17:45,290
Floyd Mayweather（黑人拳击手）在推特上评论林书豪说
Floyd mayweather on jeremy lin tweets...

1749
01:17:45,290 --> 01:17:47,420
这些炒作不过因为他是亚裔
"all the hype is because he's asian.

1750
01:17:47,430 --> 01:17:49,290
黑人球员每晚都有他那样的表现
"black players do what he does every night

1751
01:17:49,290 --> 01:17:50,790
却没有得到同等的称赞
And don't get the same praise."

1752
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,700
首先，我认为他的话是种族歧视
First of all, what he said I think is racist.

1753
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:56,230
他不但可以在NBA立足
Not only can he compete and make it in the nba,

1754
01:17:56,230 --> 01:17:59,700
他还不断创造纪录
The guy's tearing it up and is breaking records, you knucklehead.

1755
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:02,270
看看这张图，他用数学取得胜利
Check it out. "he does the math to win."

1756
01:18:02,270 --> 01:18:04,670
没错
yeah.

1757
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:07,200
我们对亚裔的很多观念根深蒂固
For many years, we've had many stereotypes about asian-americans,

1758
01:18:07,530 --> 01:18:09,200
现在一窝蜂全出来了
我们还都觉得这些都是小意思
And now they're all kind of coming
out like they're no big deal.

1759
01:18:09,530 --> 01:18:11,180
它们很要紧
They are a big deal.

1760
01:18:11,180 --> 01:18:12,550
这一天终于来了
And that'll do it.

1761
01:18:12,550 --> 01:18:14,380
（尼克斯队）的连胜终止
The winning streak comes to an end

1762
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:15,650
以令人失望的方式
In disappointing fashion,

1763
01:18:15,650 --> 01:18:17,220
新奥尔良黄蜂队
As the new orleans hornets

1764
01:18:17,220 --> 01:18:21,600
让林书豪和尼克斯队吞下
林书豪时代以来第一场失利的苦果
Hand jeremy lin and the knicks their first loss in the jeremy lin era.

1765
01:18:22,860 --> 01:18:24,460
现在变得更简单了
Now it's easier for me, you know.

1766
01:18:24,460 --> 01:18:26,030
如果有人说了种族歧视的话
Someone will say something racist,

1767
01:18:26,030 --> 01:18:29,070
我会一笑而过，觉得很有趣
And I'll laugh, and I'll think it's funny.

1768
01:18:29,070 --> 01:18:32,330
我会把所有负面的东西
Everything I get now, like, all the negative stuff,

1769
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:33,970
都放到一个地方
I'll just put it in one place

1770
01:18:33,970 --> 01:18:35,470
然后把它们变成积极的东西
And turn it into positive stuff

1771
01:18:35,470 --> 01:18:36,870
让我正确地使用
So that I could use it the right way,

1772
01:18:36,870 --> 01:18:40,010
当我带着愤怒打球，我就会打得很烂
And when I play out of anger, I play horrible.

1773
01:18:40,010 --> 01:18:44,150
所以我学会控制自己的情绪
And so I had to learn how to control my emotions

1774
01:18:44,150 --> 01:18:46,850
然后让它随风而去
And then just, like, let it go.

1775
01:19:30,660 --> 01:19:32,930
手不要受伤
Don't break your hand.

1776
01:20:23,780 --> 01:20:26,150
你知道吗？尼克斯队的林书豪
So did you know that new knicks sensation, jeremy lin,

1777
01:20:26,150 --> 01:20:27,780
还有一个弟弟现在才大一，也打控卫
Has a brother who's a freshman point guard

1778
01:20:27,790 --> 01:20:29,080
好像是汉密尔顿学院
For hamilton college?

1779
01:20:29,090 --> 01:20:30,720
我们当然知道，不过就算不知道
We did, though even we didn't know

1780
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,120
在今天的分区决赛上
That today's continental home finale

1781
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:34,020
我们看到林书豪的整个家庭都来了
Would bring out the entire lin clan,

1782
01:20:34,030 --> 01:20:36,790
包括林书豪本人
Including the linsational jeremy himself.

1783
01:20:36,790 --> 01:20:39,760
我不知道他会来看我的比赛
I did not know he was coming to my game,

1784
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:45,430
我在学校里确实听到有人这样说
And I actually heard from a couple people on campus like,

1785
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:47,640
“嘿，听说你哥要来”
"hey, your brother's coming."

1786
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:50,940
我的反应是，“不，他不会来的”
I was like, "no, he's not."

1787
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:53,640
从来没有过
I've never really had that before,

1788
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:58,510
我的一场比赛有那么大的关注
Had that kind of hype around one of my games.

1789
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:01,050
但我觉得这并没有很大区别
But I didn't see it as that big of a difference.

1790
01:21:01,050 --> 01:21:03,650
不过就是家人来看我的比赛
It was just my family watching my game, so...

1791
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:07,020
在“林疯狂”之前他就有来看过
I mean, he did come down before linsanity happened.

1792
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:09,360
在那之前，他来看比赛时
He had come down to watch my games before that,

1793
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:10,890
完全没有人会关心
And no one really cared.

1794
01:21:13,830 --> 01:21:15,260
过去两年
For the last, like, two years,

1795
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:19,000
他在球场上一直郁郁不得志
He was never enjoying himself out there.

1796
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,400
直到与篮网队的那场比赛过后
But that new jersey game, when things were rolling,

1797
01:21:21,410 --> 01:21:24,640
我第一次觉得，他在享受比赛
For the first time, he was just, like, having fun,

1798
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:26,210
活在自己的梦想之中
Living his dream.

1799
01:21:26,210 --> 01:21:31,050
我觉得这才是“林疯狂”给他带来的，最美好的东西
I think that was, like, the best thing from linsanity.

1800
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:36,490
现在最重要的问题是：“林疯狂”能继续吗？
The big question now is, can linsanity continue?

1801
01:21:36,490 --> 01:21:38,590
我不知道这将持续多久
I don't know how long it's gonna last,

1802
01:21:38,590 --> 01:21:39,960
但现在，我不在乎
But right now, I don't care.

1803
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:42,060
林书豪底角尝试三分
Lin out of the corner for 3.

1804
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:44,790
球进了！
Count 'em all!

1805
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:47,930
如果有人说预料到这一切，那是在瞎说
Anyone who said they saw this coming is lying!

1806
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:51,800
他能做到的远不止于人们以为的那样
There's a lot more that he can do

1807
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:54,440
他的信心已经今非昔比
Than anybody knew, and it comes down to confidence.

1808
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:55,540
林书豪突破
Jeremy on the drive.

1809
01:21:55,540 --> 01:21:57,540
2+1打成
And-1 for jeremy lin!

1810
01:21:57,540 --> 01:21:59,910
打进还造成犯规
He got the bang and the bucket.

1811
01:21:59,910 --> 01:22:01,810
他有自己的招牌
He's got that swagger.

1812
01:22:01,810 --> 01:22:03,110
他现在很有范儿
He has that "it" right now.

1813
01:22:03,110 --> 01:22:05,750
这超越了体育的范畴
This transcends sports. It really does.

1814
01:22:05,750 --> 01:22:07,480
他在当今体育界最美妙的故事里大放光芒
He has shined and evolved into {\i1}the{\i} best story in sports today.

1815
01:22:07,490 --> 01:22:10,650


1816
01:22:10,660 --> 01:22:11,990
在后场施加压力
Pressure in the backcourt.

1817
01:22:11,990 --> 01:22:14,990
林书豪抢断，直捣黄龙
Oh, and lin the steal! To the basket!

1818
01:22:25,270 --> 01:22:27,470
林书豪面对德克·诺维茨基的防守
Lin, over dirk.

1819
01:22:27,470 --> 01:22:29,510
噢噢噢！
Ohh!

1820
01:22:29,510 --> 01:22:31,670
太精彩了
How good is this?

1821
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:35,540
我只是想去享受比赛
I'm just out there having fun

1822
01:22:35,550 --> 01:22:36,850
打好球
And playing a game.

1823
01:22:36,850 --> 01:22:39,180
我会有表现不好的时候
I can have bad games, and, you know,

1824
01:22:39,180 --> 01:22:41,980
他们也许会不喜欢我，会嘘我
They may not like me, or they may boo me.

1825
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:43,550
但生命中有很多事情远比篮球重要
There's a lot more important things in life than just basketball.

1826
01:22:43,550 --> 01:22:45,290


1827
01:22:45,290 --> 01:22:48,220
毕竟篮球只是一场游戏
'cause at the end of the day, basketball's just a game.

1828
01:22:48,230 --> 01:22:51,190
这场秀还在继续
The show continues on broadway.

1829
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:55,560
这个故事有很多亮点
It's a story with many spokes.

1830
01:22:55,570 --> 01:22:57,930
常春藤，美籍亚裔运动员
An ivy leaguer, asian-american athlete,

1831
01:22:57,940 --> 01:22:59,770
从替补席横空出世
Guy off the end of the bench.

1832
01:22:59,770 --> 01:23:02,170
为所有没有得到机会的人代言
Speaks for everyone who didn't get their chance.

1833
01:23:02,170 --> 01:23:05,610
只是短短的几周，在纽约城
It's only a couple of weeks, but in new york city,

1834
01:23:05,610 --> 01:23:07,780
在篮球这一大舞台上
And on basketball's big stage,

1835
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:09,410
他已经把故事带出了篮球这个公园
This guy has hit it out of the park.

1836
01:23:11,250 --> 01:23:13,080
在我身上发生的故事
What happened to me, the story that happened to me,

1837
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:15,250
并不是说，我早就知道
I mean, it wasn't like I knew

1838
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:17,220
我能从替补席上来完成那些事情
I could just come off the bench and do that.

1839
01:23:17,220 --> 01:23:18,390
我真的不知道
I really didn't.

1840
01:23:18,390 --> 01:23:20,890
我觉得自己有这个水平
Um, I thought I could play at this level,

1841
01:23:20,890 --> 01:23:22,260
我觉得自己可以成为好的球员
And I thought I could be a good player,

1842
01:23:22,260 --> 01:23:24,160
但我没想到会发生这一系列事情
But I didn't feel like that would happen.

1843
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:26,960
有些球场上的经历
And some of those experiences out there when I was on the court,

1844
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:28,960


1845
01:23:28,970 --> 01:23:31,130
我觉得自己是被别的力量控制着
I felt like I was being controlled by something else.

1846
01:23:31,140 --> 01:23:33,770
有些完全超出肉体
I felt like I was having an out-of-body experience.

1847
01:23:33,770 --> 01:23:35,870
我完成的一些得分
Some of the plays that I made,

1848
01:23:35,870 --> 01:23:37,640
我们的一些胜利
Some of the wins that we had,

1849
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:40,110
真的超出了这个世界
Were just so out of this world

1850
01:23:40,110 --> 01:23:42,950
我时常还要掐一下自己
That I still have to pinch myself

1851
01:23:42,950 --> 01:23:46,350
才能相信这是真的
To really believe it.

1852
01:23:47,350 --> 01:23:51,980
{\i1}职业生涯前9场首发比赛中{\i}

1853
01:23:52,150 --> 01:23:55,000
{\i1}场均9.9次助攻，2.2次抢断{\i}

1854
01:23:57,750 --> 01:23:59,920
{\i1}25.0分{\i}

1855
01:24:04,530 --> 01:24:08,530
{\i1}在NBA 65年的历史中
这个记录前无古人{\i}

1856
01:24:11,530 --> 01:24:19,530
{\i1}他创纪录式的表现过后
在休赛期成为自由球员{\i}

1857
01:24:21,530 --> 01:24:27,530
{\i1}他只收到休斯顿火箭队的报价
并最终签下3年2500万美元的合同{\i}

1858
01:24:36,530 --> 01:24:40,400
{\i1}随着林书豪翻开新的篇章{\i}
{\i1}As jeremy ends one chapter and begins another,{\i}

1859
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:44,010
{\i1}前面的路将不断地考验他的毅力{\i}
{\i1}The road ahead will continue to test his perseverance.{\i}

1860
01:24:45,180 --> 01:24:48,380
{\i1}他的信念将永远指引他{\i}
{\i1}But his faith will forever guide him.{\i}

1861
01:24:52,950 --> 01:24:55,150
去年我学会了
The thing I had to learn last year

1862
01:24:55,150 --> 01:24:56,520
完美的计划并不是
Is a perfect plan doesn't mean

1863
01:24:56,520 --> 01:25:00,490
所有的事情都如你所愿
That it ends up the way you want it to end up.

1864
01:25:00,490 --> 01:25:02,760
如果你之前问我，什么是完美的计划
In the past, if you asked me what's a perfect plan,

1865
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:03,960
我可能会答，“心想事成”
I'd be like, "I get what I want,

1866
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:06,100
“打好球，实现梦想”
I get my dream, I play well."

1867
01:25:09,030 --> 01:25:10,900
现在我有新的看法
Now I have a different perspective

1868
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:13,440
关于什么才是完美的计划
On what a perfect plan is.

1869
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:17,140
如果你一直赢，你不会成长
You don't get better if you win all the time.

1870
01:25:17,140 --> 01:25:18,940
只有失败才会让你成长
You know, you get better when you lose.

1871
01:25:18,940 --> 01:25:20,310
失败让你提高
You improve when you lose.

1872
01:25:20,310 --> 01:25:22,210
失败让你更加反思自我
You look at yourself more when you lose.

1873
01:25:22,210 --> 01:25:24,850
如果你我都学到很多
So if you learn a lot or if I learn a lot,

1874
01:25:24,850 --> 01:25:26,320
如果我有很好的成长
If I grow a lot,

1875
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:29,650
如果我随着时间流逝变成更好的人
If I become a better person through tough times,

1876
01:25:29,650 --> 01:25:31,090
这才是神的完美计划的一部分
That's part of his perfect plan.

1877
01:25:31,090 --> 01:25:33,060
才是神的完美旨意的一部分
That's part of his perfect will.

1878
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:52,040
如果我感到缺乏安全感
When I was going through all my insecurities

1879
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:54,110
失去信心
And uncertainty and lack of confidence,

1880
01:25:54,110 --> 01:25:56,850
那是因为我分散了对神的专注
I was losing focus on god.

1881
01:25:56,850 --> 01:25:58,410
我把注意力放到别的事情上了
I was focusing on all these other things,

1882
01:25:58,420 --> 01:26:02,080
比如我的工作和别人的想法
Like my job and what other people thought of me

1883
01:26:02,090 --> 01:26:05,120
以及各种对我的报道
And what the reporters were writing.

1884
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:08,820
但随着时间流逝，我会反思自己
You know, over time, I was able to check myself

1885
01:26:08,830 --> 01:26:10,860
找回我对神的专注
And kind of get my focus back.

1886
01:26:12,260 --> 01:26:14,230
我觉得神对我做了一些超自然的事情
And I think god did something supernatural in me,

1887
01:26:14,230 --> 01:26:17,070
一些我无法以一己之力完成的事情
Something that I couldn't do on my own,

1888
01:26:17,070 --> 01:26:21,000
有些我也许永远无法复制
Something that I may never be able to recreate.

1889
01:26:22,270 --> 01:26:23,910
所以在那件事上
So I think, in that instance,

1890
01:26:23,910 --> 01:26:27,480
我只是学着去奋斗
I was just learning to fight

1891
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:30,510
去为了神而生活和打球
To constantly live and play for god.

1892
01:26:30,510 --> 01:26:34,150
如果我做到这些，我就能完成看似不可能的事情
And when I do that, I'll be able to walk on water.

1893
01:27:02,210 --> 01:27:03,910
上面全是《狮子王》的角色
It's all about {\i1}lion king.{\i}

1894
01:27:03,910 --> 01:27:05,410
这里有娜娜
We have nala right here,

1895
01:27:05,530 --> 01:27:09,060
还有小辛巴，丁满和彭彭
Baby simba, timon and pumbaa.

1896
01:27:09,860 --> 01:29:14,730
