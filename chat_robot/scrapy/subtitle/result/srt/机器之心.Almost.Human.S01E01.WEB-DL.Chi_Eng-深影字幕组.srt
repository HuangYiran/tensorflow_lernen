第一季  第一集

29
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,260
2048年

30
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:08,950
科技的发展已经失去了控制

31
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,700
未知的毒品及武器在街道和学校泛滥

32
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:19,180
走私团伙被不明暴力犯罪组织操纵

33
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:23,280
犯罪率也惊人地提高了400%

34
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:28,940
人手不足 装备落后 执法机关只得颁布一项新的措施:

35
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:34,160
每名警察都需配备一名先进的机器战警作为搭档

36
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,020
我们中埋伏了
It's an ambush!

37
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,460
约翰 真该死
John, damn it.

38
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,410
我中弹了 我不行了
I've been hit! I'm down!

39
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,280
- 佩勒姆 - 我在西侧
- Pelham! - On the west side!

40
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:07,030
佩勒姆不行了
Pelham's down.

41
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,740
- 我要你带我进去 - 我们不知道里面有多少人
- I need you to lead me in! - We don't know how many suspects are in there.

42
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,380
- 冒生命危险去救另一... - 闭嘴
- Risking one life to save one life... - Shut up!

43
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,130
带我进去 快
Lead me in! Move!

44
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,310
嘿 兄弟 情况不太妙啊
Hey, buddy. So this ain't good.

45
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,930
对 确实不妙 但有些情况比这还糟糕
No, it's not. Could always be worse!

46
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,940
还真更糟糕了
It just got worse.

47
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,620
他们早就等着我们送上门了 约翰
They were ready for us, John.

48
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,040
反联组织怎么知道我们要来
How did Insyndicate know we were coming?

49
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,490
他们怎么知道的
How did they know?

50
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,640
- 机器人 - 他们怎么知道的
- MX! - How'd they know?

51
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,030
我们要撤离这里 给他诊断一下
We're getting out of here. Give me a diagnostic!

52
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,280
血压正在下降
Blood pressure's dropping,

53
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,260
腹腔动脉被炸断了
celiac artery's blown apart.

54
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,740
我们无能为力了 长官
There's nothing to do, sir.

55
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,290
我们要撤离这里
We're getting out of here.

56
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,370
在你带他离开之前 他就会失血过多而死 
He will bleed to death before you get him out of here.

57
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,900
- 闭嘴 掩护我们 我们要撤了 - 我不能那么做
- Shut up! Cover us! We're leaving! - I cannot do that.

58
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,340
统计结果表明其余人生还的可能性更大
Others have a better statistical chance of surviving.

59
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,950
我需要保护他们
I need to protect them.

60
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:12,770
- 你是否要陪着你的搭档 - 我当然要
- Are you staying with your partner? - You're damn right I am!

61
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,240
嘿 你给我回来
Hey! Come back here!

62
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,820
跟我来
Come on.

63
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,560
告诉我你记起了什么
Tell me what you remember.

64
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,190
这一次...
This time...

65
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:54,760
我记起了无线电呼叫
I remember the radio call.

66
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,120
佩勒姆呼叫的
From Pelham.

67
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:57,430
你的搭档
Your partner.

68
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,460
对 但仅此而已了
Yeah. But not much more than that.

69
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,560
我还是想不起所有细节
I still can't remember every detail.

70
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,410
我想再来一次
I want to go again.

71
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,590
你今晚已经有很大进步了 约翰
You made good progress tonight, John.

72
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,050
你昏迷了十七个月 对吧
You were in a coma for 17 months, yes?

73
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,240
严格意义上来说 我们应该等你完全清醒一年
Technically, we shouldn't be doing this procedure

74
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,520
再进行这项程序
until you've been fully conscious for one year.

75
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,370
是啊
Yeah.

76
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,270
严格意义上来说
Well, technically...

77
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:19,850
你只是一个没有行医执照
you're an unlicensed doctor from SubAsia

78
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,080
而且私用黑市药物的亚洲医生
practicing black market medicine.

79
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,590
没错
Well, yes,

80
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,730
如果你愿意可以把我关进监狱
you can throw me in prison if you want,

81
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:30,620
但是 我是出于好意 把你当做病人收留了
but... I accepted you as a patient out of kindness.

82
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,550
我最初见到你的时候 你看起来很绝望
You seemed like a desperate man when I met you.

83
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,690
现在呢
And now?

84
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,260
现在 你看起来很绝望
Now... you seem like a desperate man.

85
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:41,590
约翰 我知道你说过伏击你们的人消失了
John, I know you said the people who ambushed you disappeared,

86
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,210
但是 就算我尽最大的努力
but, despite my best efforts,

87
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,130
你可能还是想不起他们是谁
you may not remember who they are.

88
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,160
大多数来找回忆师的人
Most people come to a Recollectionist...

89
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,260
是为了想起一些美好的事物
they want to remember good things.

90
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:54,500
你为什么就不能放下这件事呢 已经两年了
Why can't you let this go? It's been two years.

91
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,500
你要知道
You know...

92
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,410
他们杀了我的队友
they killed my team...

93
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,300
我的朋友
...my friends.

94
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,200
不接受这项治疗 我就想不起任何事
And without this treatment, I can't remember anything.

95
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,130
我这次还想起了一些别的事情
I remembered something else this time.

96
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,400
我的前女友
My ex-girlfriend.

97
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:19,680
安娜
Anna.

98
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,240
我们在我的公寓里
We were in my apartment.

99
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,750
奇怪了
Strange.

100
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,420
下次我来...
I'll, uh...

101
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,780
改进一下那组集群的触发器
refine the triggering of that cluster next time.

102
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,020
你流鼻血了
Your nose is bleeding.

103
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,400
警探
Detective.

104
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,830
你还好吗
You all right?

105
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,010
还好
Yeah.

106
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,100
你的机器人搭档呢
Where's your MX?

107
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:26,530
我下班了
I'm off duty.

108
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,240
- 你的人类搭档呢 - 在和目击者谈话
- Where's your human? - Talking to a witness.

109
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,020
一小时前有几个人翻墙过来了
Individuals came over the wall an hour ago.

110
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,260
请小心驾驶
Drive safely.

111
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,310
我会的
Yeah, I will.

112
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,600
738天前的信息
Message saved for 738 days.

113
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,870
嗨 宝贝
Hi, honey.

114
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,390
我知道你可能还在睡觉 但是
So, I know you're probably still asleep, but,

115
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,480
约翰 太阳就要落山了
John, the sun is setting

116
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,920
这是我见过的最美的景色
and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

117
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,790
快看
Look.

118
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,880
你爸爸肯定会喜欢这个地方
Your father would've loved this place.

119
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:50,410
哦 我等不及要回到你的身边了
Oh, I can't wait to get back to you.

120
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,510
我知道我还得再等一个星期 但是...
I know I have to wait a week, but...

121
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:57,580
我真的很希望你能在这里陪着我
what I really wish is that you were here with me.

122
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,060
- 早上好 - 早上好
- Morning. - Morning.

123
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,080
- 你来上班吗 - 我知道我说过我准备好了
- You coming in? - I know I said I was ready.

124
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,150
只要再给我一天假就好
Just give me one more day.

125
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:23,470
不 我已经给过你一天假了
No. I already gave you one more day.

126
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,920
然后又是一天 又是一天
And another and another.

127
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,300
是时候了 约翰
It's time, John.

128
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:28,980
约翰
John?

129
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,370
我刚刚收到一个报告 在南凯尔文发生了一起武装抢劫
I just got a report of a coordinated armed robbery in South Kelvin.

130
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,150
看起来像是反联组织干的
Looks like it was Insyndicate.

131
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,230
反联组织
Insyndicate?

132
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,170
好吧
Okay.

133
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,370
我一会就过去
I'll come in.

134
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,110
人造骨骼校准未完成
Synthetic calibration incomplete.

135
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,930
人造骨骼校准未完成
Synthetic calibration incomplete.

136
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,200
人造骨骼校准未完...
Synthetic calibration incompl...

137
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,390
- 我无法访问系统 你进去了吗 - 我进去了 
- I can't access the system. Are you in? - I'm in.

138
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,670
我登陆不进去啊
I'm not in. I'm out.

139
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,110
我所有文件都被锁住了
All my files are locked.

140
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:20,660
听起来像是马丁内斯又在作弄你了
Sounds like Martinez is messing with you again.

141
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,870
我们应该在休战了
We're supposed to be in a truce,

142
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:24,390
如果是真的 我要杀了他
so, if that's true, I'm gonna kill him.

143
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,150
还有另一种可能性
Well, there is one other possibility.

144
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,890
你是不是又忘了你的密码了 沃格尔探长
Did you forget your password again, detective Vogel?

145
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:36,050
睡了两年的人看来状态不错
Not bad for a guy who's been asleep for two years.

146
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,950
我不敢苟同
I wouldn't say that.

147
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,890
我看他很弱
He looks weak, to me.

148
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,330
理查德
Richard,

149
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:46,060
我知道这对你来说不容易 但不要当刺头儿
I know this won't be easy for you, don't be a prick.

150
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:48,180
这个部门就算没有他也能办好事
This department's handled affairs just fine without him.

151
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,330
你对肯尼思有什么意见
What's your problem with Kennex?

152
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,240
别听他废话 你会无聊死的
Don't ask to hear the story... you'll die of boredom.

153
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,960
还会被浓烈的嫉妒情绪毒害
And exposure to severe envy.

154
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,550
他有什么可让人嫉妒的
Look, there's nothing to envy in him.

155
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,620
肯尼思负责的那次突击
Kennex oversaw that raid,

156
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,150
明明掌握了所有情报 却使他的队伍被伏击
controlled all the intel and got his team ambushed.

157
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:02,610
除了肯尼思这个负责人 所有人都被杀了
Everyone, except the one man responsible... Kennex... was killed.

158
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,220
他应该被免职才对
Should've been discharged.

159
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,130
理查德
Richard.

160
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,050
他不会久留
He won't last.

161
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:08,780
你们瞧好吧
You just watch.

162
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:24,140
约翰・肯尼思注册完成
Kennex, John. Registration complete.

163
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,380
谢谢
Thanks.

164
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,300
肯尼思警探
Detective Kennex,

165
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,800
我是编号785 我被指派给你了
I'm 785. I've been assigned to you.

166
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,210
我知道这是你回来的第一天
I'm aware this is your first day back.

167
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:38,430
我只想帮助你尽可能顺利的适应现役职务
I only want to make your acclimation to active duty as smooth as possible for you.

168
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,030
我会参与你所有...
I'm here to attend to all your n...

169
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:42,210
我不会和那种东西一起出车
I'm not driving with one of those things.

170
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,590
对我爸来说 有人类搭档就够了
Human partner was good enough for my father.

171
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:45,890
对我来说也一样
It's good enough for me.

172
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:47,000
自从你离开之后
Since you were last here,

173
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,960
配备MX已经成了硬性规定
MX partners have become mandatory.

174
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,210
我不想就规章制度的事跟你吵 好吗
I'm not gonna fight you on some kind of regulation thing, okay?

175
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:53,180
- 我不干 - 不干也得干
- I'm not doing it. - Like hell you're not.

176
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,020
你读过蒂尔登分析你的档案吗
Have you read Tilden's profile of you?

177
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,480
顺便说一下 他是个非常厉害的精神病医生
And, by the way, he is a very capable psychiatrist.

178
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,620
"肯尼思永远不能复职"
"Kennex should return to service never."

179
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,980
永远 这...这时间长了点吧 
Never? Wow, that's... that's a long time.

180
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,160
"肯尼思饱受抑郁症 精神萎靡
"Kennex is suffering from depression, mental atrophy,

181
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,600
创伤性强迫症 创伤后应激障碍
trauma onset OCD, PTSD

182
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,480
以及心理上排斥仿生部件等问题的折磨"
and psychological rejection of his synthetic body parts."

183
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,210
最后一句倒是真的
Well, that last part is true.

184
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,950
听着 你是唯一一个比我更迫切地
Listen, you're the only person more desperate than I am

185
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,330
想知道反联组织是怎样知道那次突击的
to find out how Insyndicate learned about the raid.

186
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,350
只要我们合作就会找到答案
If we work together, we can do it.

187
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,840
案件发生在几小时前
This happened a few hours ago.

188
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,900
劫持目标是一辆装有生物研究制品的武装卡车
Robbery target was an armored truck, carrying bio research.

189
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,500
如果这起劫案是反联组织策划的
If this is an Insyndicate operation,

190
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,410
我们或许能更了解他们
it might help us learn more about them.

191
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,610
和上次行动有什么联系
What's the connection?

192
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:38,350
使用抛物线型脉冲电荷来阻止车辆
Parabolic pulse charge was used to stop the vehicle.

193
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,420
伏击之后我就没见过这种作案手法
I haven't seen that since the ambush.

194
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,180
那倒像是反联组织干的
Well, sure looks like Insyndicate.

195
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,370
- 库存报告在吗 - 还没有
- Inventory report? - That's not in yet.

196
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,690
不管他们想要什么 他们杀了四名安保人员
Whatever they wanted, they killed four security guards to get it.

197
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,320
其中一个劫匪被我们打伤
One of the thieves was shot.

198
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,950
正在郡医院接受治疗
He's being treated at County.

199
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:57,860
约翰
John?

200
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,530
反联组织的事不要告诉别人 好吗 
Keep the Insyndicate connection between us, okay?

201
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:04,920
你觉得我们部门有内奸
You think someone in the department's working with them?

202
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,030
你是我唯一相信的人
You're the only guy I trust here.

203
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:11,680
好的
Okay.

204
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,880
我去查查
I'll check it out.

205
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,950
还有一件事
One more thing.

206
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,870
对你的搭档好一点
Go easy on your partner.

207
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:24,710
走吧
Come.

208
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:38,190
卡车是全能公司的一间私人实验室的
Truck belongs to a private lab run by Omni,

209
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,440
他们公司从事的是DNA研究
company specializing in DNA research.

210
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,980
据经理说 
According to the manager,

211
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:46,340
车里是装有人造单链可编程DNA的试剂瓶
they were transporting vials of single-strand synthetic, programmable DNA.

212
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,130
探长 我是瓦莱丽・斯特尔
Detective? Valerie Stahl.

213
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,080
约翰・肯尼思
John Kennex.

214
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,900
- 见到你很高兴 - 我也是
- Pleasure to meet you. - You, too.

215
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:53,690
好的
Okay.

216
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,260
说说你对可编程DNA知道些什么
So tell me what you got on programmable DNA.

217
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:59,960
可编程DNA可以用来启动组织的再生过程
Programmable DNA can be used to trigger the process of tissue creation.

218
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,480
比如 可以利用人体来培育器官
For example, to grow sets of organs in humans,

219
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,920
再拿去贩卖
possibly for harvest.

220
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,140
还带走了什么东西
What else was taken?

221
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,570
酸 苯碳化物 塞亚诺 迈克隆红
Acid, bencarmidium, thianel, Myklon Red.

222
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,250
迈克隆红
Myklon Red.

223
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,170
迈克隆红 迈克隆红
Myklon Red, Myklon Red...

224
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:23,160
探长
Detective?

225
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,320
探长 你没事吧
Detective, you okay?

226
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,270
没事 我很好 谢谢
Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks.

227
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,700
这片区域是黑色高棉组织的地盘
This sector is Khmer Black territory.

228
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,700
高棉是柬埔寨的旧称

229
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:38,170
他们以前就是搞生物技术非法交易的
They've been known to traffic in biotech in the past.

230
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:40,150
我们正在搜捕其中有嫌疑的人
We're rounding up the usual suspects.

231
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:42,050
你觉得不是他们干的
You don't buy it?

232
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,300
鲁比・马半年前接替了他死去哥哥的位子
Ruby Mah assumed leadership of the gang six months ago

233
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,530
成了团伙的老大
when his brother was killed.

234
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:49,000
但团伙内部对此有异议 他们认为他太过西化了 
It was controversial. He's seen as too Western.

235
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,070
所以他需要向手下展示他传统的一面
He needs to show the people he's traditional.

236
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,210
今天是柬埔寨新年的最后一天
Today is the last day of the Cambodian New Year,

237
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:55,880
叫做新岁日 是忏悔过错的一天
Loeung Sakk, a day of repentance for wrongdoing.

238
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,910
他今天不会实施暴力
He wouldn't commit violence today.

239
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,220
这是其他组织干的
This was another gang.

240
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:04,450
我去找找行为倾向的数据 确定犯罪模式
I'll find behavioral tendencies in data and identify criminal patterns.

241
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:08,440
还是我来之前情报分析员就已经分析过了
Or didn't intelligence analysts do that before I got here?

242
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,940
谢谢 我 呃...非常感谢
Thanks. I, uh... I really appreciate it.

243
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,560
失陪
Excuse me.

244
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,750
没事
Sure.

245
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:32,230
- 告诉总部我们要回去了 - 刚刚你怎么回事
- Tell command we're 10-19. - What happened back there?

246
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,030
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

247
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,680
看起来像癫痫症发作
It seemed like a petit mal seizure.

248
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,580
我必须向上级报告
I will need to report what I saw.

249
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,190
我没事 你不需要报告任何事
I'm fine. You're not gonna report anything.

250
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,250
昨晚你在科隆街区
You were in Koln Avenue District last night.

251
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,720
一个MX看到了你
An MX saw you there.

252
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,390
据我所知 探长
I am concerned, Detective.

253
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,530
那片区域有大量地下黑诊所
That area is populated by numerous black market medical clinics.

254
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,570
还有美味的拉面馆
And some tasty noodle joints.

255
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:56,290
听着 我很感谢你的关心
Look, I appreciate your concern,

256
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,290
不过没什么需要报告的
but there's nothing to report.

257
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:17,250
另一件奇怪的事 肯尼思探长
Another curious thing, Detective Kennex?

258
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,290
昨晚 你的呼吸中没有夹杂食物颗粒
Last night, there were no comestible trace particles on your breath,

259
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:22,330
表明你并没有吃拉面
indicating you were not there for noodles.

260
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:23,410
我认为我们应该...
I think we should...

261
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,490
嗨 鲁迪
Hey, Rudy.

262
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,480
我不是撞鬼了吧
As I live and breathe.

263
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,130
或者说 你居然还活着
Or should I say, as you live and breathe?

264
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,340
最近怎么样
How are ya?

265
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,980
每天都在回绝派对邀请
Constantly turning down party invitations.

266
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,330
现在我已经很受女性欢迎了
I've become quite popular with the ladies.

267
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,830
要我做什么
How can I help?

268
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,200
我需要一个新机器人 这是授权令
I got a rec order for another synthetic.

269
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,510
他摔坏了
He fell?

270
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,800
掉出了疾驰的汽车
Out of a moving car?

271
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,370
是啊 很惊讶吧 一定是软件的问题
Yeah, crazy, huh? Must be some kind of software issue.

272
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:08,920
我得搞个新的
Gonna need a new one.

273
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,960
软件会出问题
Software?

274
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:16,530
鉴于我们没有可用的MX机器人
Since we don't have any MXs available,

275
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:19,470
而警局允许服役的机器人只有这一款了
department's only cleared one model for active duty.

276
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,850
有趣的是 这个其实...
Funny, actually. This, uh...

277
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:25,480
这个下个月要被安排转移到NASA去
this unit was scheduled to be transferred to NASA next month.

278
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:25,480
NASA: 美国国家航空航天局

279
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,290
挺可悲的
It's sad really.

280
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,760
他只是坨废铁
He's scrap metal.

281
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,350
他脊椎里用稀土金属做成的电路
The trimidium circuits in his spinal column are

282
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,470
比他全身加起来都值钱
worth more than the whole of him.

283
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,670
等等 这是...这是疯了的那款吧
Wait a minute. That's... that's one of the crazy ones.

284
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,930
什么 才不是呢 这么说太粗鲁了 
What? No. That's rude.

285
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:44,220
- 本质上说不算疯 - 你知道 他们有...
- Not crazy, per se. - You know, they had their...

286
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:47,640
什么 毛病 谁还没点毛病呢
What? Problems? Who doesn't have problems?

287
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,580
技术角度来说 他们功能完美
Technically, they're perfectly functional.

288
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,730
看看他
Look at him.

289
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,350
很适合出门
He's road-worthy.

290
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,710
约翰 这是多利安 多利安这是约翰
John, Dorian. Dorian, John.

291
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,270
好了 应该能用了
There. Should be functional.

292
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,860
他的测向器以前坏了
His DF was bad.

293
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,500
有什么我要注意的吗
Anything I need to know?

294
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,020
DRN系列的机器人
Well, the DRN series--

295
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:14,240
他们是基于一个叫人造灵魂的项目而开发
they were based on a program called Synthetic Soul.

296
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,790
按你的说法 当他不疯的时候
And while he isn't crazy, as you say,

297
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,350
会有一些小故障
there may be some bugs.

298
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,920
故障 什么样的故障
Bugs? What kind of bugs?

299
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,900
有一些机器人无法处理他们的情感准则
Some of them had difficulty dealing with their emotive regulations.

300
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,210
出现情感问题
Emotional issues.

301
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,090
DRN的设计初衷是让其尽可能的和人类接近
The idea behind the DRNs was to be as human as possible.

302
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:31,990
而事实上 人类会有一些无法预计的情绪反应
And the truth is that it's human to have unexpected emotional responses.

303
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:36,250
如果把接近人类作为目标的话
And if, uh, being as close to human was the goal, then,

304
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:39,730
那我想DRN系列应该不算太失败
I guess the DRNs weren't such a failure after all.

305
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,850
人们会情绪崩溃
People have breaking points, and...

306
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,540
所以DRN也会崩溃
so do DRNs.

307
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,150
所以你的意思是他是个不健全的人
So you're saying he's a basket case.

308
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:48,480
我可没说过 也没承认过
Not words I would use, or agree with.

309
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,150
好吧 准备好了就插上电源吧 我得回街上了 
All right, plug it in already. I got to get back on the street.

310
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:54,030
好的
Okay.

311
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,180
唤醒他的荣幸就交给你了
Please have the honor of waking him up yourself.

312
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,760
触碰他的左耳
Touch it against his left ear.

313
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:19,200
我睡了多久
How long was I out?

314
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:22,850
四年零三个月
Uh, four years and three months.

315
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,890
约翰・肯尼思探长
Detective John Kennex.

316
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,470
我叫多利安 你好
I'm Dorian. How are you?

317
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:43,400
您的记录非常杰出
Your record is outstanding.

318
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,750
过去是
Used to be.

319
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,010
抱歉
Excuse me?

320
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:48,130
更新你的资料 我们走
Update your files. Let's go.

321
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,630
嘿 老大
Hey, boss.

322
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,950
他出来了
He's on the move.

323
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,480
我们走
Let's go!

324
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,060
大家听见了吗 我们走
You heard him. Let's go.

325
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:26,070
我该怎么称呼您
So what do I call you?

326
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,570
探长
Detective.

327
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,810
好吧 探长 这活儿可比在CNA太空站
Well, Detective, this sure beats repairing thermal insulation tiles

328
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,660
修补隔热砖强多了
on the C.N.A. Space Station.

329
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:38,540
你也知道 我四年前就退役了
I was decommissioned four years ago, as you know.

330
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,750
为什么我和你在一辆车里
Why am I in this car with you?

331
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,120
我必须和一个人造人一起开车
I'm required to ride with a synthetic.

332
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,930
我对那个词可不感冒
I'm not a huge fan of that term.

333
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,330
圣・克里斯托弗
St. Christopher.

334
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:55,410
这肯定是别人送你的礼物 对吗
This has to be a gift from someone. Am I right?

335
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,790
大约80%的可能性是件礼物
Something like 80% of these are given as gifts.

336
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:59,710
人造人都是很严谨的
Synthetics are precise.

337
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,150
又是那个词
There's that term again.

338
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,490
你刚刚说"大约80%"
You just said, "Something like 80%."

339
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:05,460
准确的数据是83.42%
The actual statistic is 83.42%,

340
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,130
但我在运行我的日常口语程序
but I'm running my colloquialism routine,

341
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:09,870
所以我得表达大量的口语数据 伙计
so I express most data conversationally, man.

342
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,220
棒极了
Terrific.

343
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,320
那"A"是谁
So, who's "A"?

344
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,750
艾迪森 安妮 艾德琳
Addison? Annie? Adeline?

345
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,530
阿兰娜 安尼塔
Alana? Anita?

346
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:23,310
艾米 奥黛丽 海蓝宝石
Amy? Audrey? Aquamarine?

347
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,670
好吧 够了 行了吗
Okay, that's enough, all right?

348
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:27,560
人造人系统关闭
Um... synthetic off.

349
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,820
人造人关机
Synthetic off?

350
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,680
你是说 让我安静吗
Does that mean you want me to be quiet?

351
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,760
对 不管你的安静模式是什么 调到那个模式
Yeah, whatever the mode is for you to be quiet, just do that.

352
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,410
哥们 我能安静
Hey, man, I can be quiet.

353
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:42,570
只要你...要求
You can just... ask.

354
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:47,780
人造骨骼校准未完成
Synthetic calibration incomplete.

355
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:51,530
人造骨骼校准未完成
Synthetic calibration incomplete.

356
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,240
原地待命 很快回来
Stand by. I'll be back.

357
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,180
好了 女士
Here you go, ma'am.

358
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:12,890
我要一杯黑咖啡 不加糖
Yeah, give me a black coffee, no sugar.

359
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,510
没问题 沃格尔探员
You got it, Detective Vogel.

360
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:25,170
沃格尔警官 很高兴再见到您
Officer Vogel, it's good to see you again.

361
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,440
你是谁
Who are you?

362
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:53,870
这种人造人好几年都没见过了
Haven't seen one of those synthetics for years.

363
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,760
妙极
It's perfect.

364
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,080
两个垃圾堆里捡来的警察
Two cops from the scrap heap.

365
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,280
比我想得更可悲啊
This is gonna be more pathetic than I thought.

366
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,600
这些就是取代我的那款
Those are the models that replaced me.

367
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:07,920
真吓人
Intimidating.

368
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:10,900
去注册 准备走了
Go register so we can get moving.

369
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,890
DRN注册完毕
DRN registration complete.

370
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:26,060
嘿 机器人
Hey, bot.

371
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,500
别把我们给咬了
Don't snap on us, now.

372
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:35,830
长官 沃格尔探员被绑架了
Sir, Detective Vogel's been abducted.

373
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,610
马尔多纳多希望你来调查
Maldonado wants you on it.

374
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:39,510
他的MX被销毁了
His MX was destroyed.

375
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:40,830
残余的数据只有这些
This is all we could get off it.

376
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:41,980
从面具来判断
Based on the masks,

377
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:44,190
这跟那次武装抢劫是同一伙人
these are the same guys from the armed robbery.

378
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,480
嫌疑人从郡医院带来了吗
Suspect back from County?

379
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:52,610
你的人杀了我们四个警卫
Your gang kills four security guards.

380
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,390
现在又抓了个警察
Now you've taken a cop.

381
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:55,880
他在哪
Where is he?

382
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,810
他们抓他是因为你在我们手上吗
Did they take him 'cause we have you?

383
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,370
你知道这是什么吗
You know what this is?

384
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,860
是你的登记文件
It's your booking file.

385
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,710
记录着我们抓到你时你的状况
It describes the condition you were in when we got you.

386
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,310
那
Now...

387
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:17,040
你们拿走可编程DNA做什么
What are you doing with programmable DNA?

388
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:20,810
迈克隆红有什么用途
What's the Myklon Red for?

389
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,990
哦 看哪 嫌犯眼睛上方有一条抓痕
Oh, look, suspect has a scratch above his eye.

390
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,600
不知道怎么弄的
I have no idea how he got that.

391
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,230
添加到文件里 可能还要添加"臼齿失踪"
Better add it, and get ready to write down "missing molar".

392
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:39,020
还有别的办法 警探
There are other ways, Detective.

393
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:42,590
是我在审问这人 不是你 明白
I'm questioning this man, okay, not you.

394
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:46,910
那么
Now...

395
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:50,540
人造骨骼失灵 需要校准
Synthetic fail. Calibration required.

396
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,520
人造骨骼失灵 需要校准
Synthetic fail. Calibration required.

397
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:55,500
人造骨骼...
Synthetic fa...

398
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,530
枪是你自己开的
You shot yourself.

399
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,340
也许今早比较混乱
Perhaps it was a bit crazy this morning,

400
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,660
所以郡里的医生可能没看出来
maybe the doctors at County even missed it,

401
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,410
但是 根据你中的子弹的轨迹
but the trajectory of the bullet that hit you,

402
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:10,100
还有你肌肉烧伤的形状
the burn marks on your flesh--

403
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,400
基本上可以确定
basically there's no chance

404
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,280
子弹不会来自别人的手枪
that you were hit by a bullet from any gun but your own.

405
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,550
真的吗
Is that true?

406
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:27,700
你不了解我在为谁卖命
You don't know the people I work for.

407
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,820
相信我 我了解
Trust me, I do.

408
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,180
我必须想尽一切办法离开他们
I needed to get away from them any way I could,

409
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,840
因为谁都无法逃走
because there's no getting away from them.

410
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,820
听着 我们能帮你
Look, we can help you,

411
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,940
可以保证你安全 但你必须给我们信息
we can keep you safe, but you need to give us information.

412
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,930
不 我到哪里都不安全 包括这里
No, I'm not safe anywhere, not even here.

413
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:39,900
我们会把你安置在有守卫的安全地点
We'll put you in a secure location under guard.

414
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,440
谁都找不到你 但你必须先坦白
No one will find you, but you need to talk.

415
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,540
那地方一定要非常安全
I need to be somewhere safe.

416
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,560
沃格尔探员在哪
Then, where's Detective Vogel?

417
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:49,920
地址是什么
What's the address?

418
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,800
格兰德街325号 6号公寓
325 Grand, Apartment 6.

419
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:03,430
这可能不需要我多说
Not that you need me to tell you this,

420
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:06,000
但你刚刚侵犯了那人的人权
but you just violated the crap out of that guy's civil rights.

421
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,620
真神奇 我的这个人造人心肠还挺软
Fantastic, I get the synthetic with the bleeding heart.

422
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,410
听着 我不管你的程序是什么
Look, I don't care what you're programmed to do.

423
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:13,450
你要是敢上报这件事 我就把你推下楼
You report what happened in there and you'll find yourself bouncing down the 604.

424
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:15,560
探长 如果我上报任何事
Detective, if I'm going to report anything,

425
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,440
都是因为我认为此事应该上报
it is because I decided it needed to be reported.

426
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,790
我不舒服
I feel sick.

427
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:34,260
我要去厕所
I need a toilet.

428
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,210
你还好吗
You all right?

429
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,320
我没事
I'll be fine.

430
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,000
停
Stop.

431
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,820
潜在爆炸装置
Potential explosive device.

432
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:26,940
人类退后
Humans back.

433
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,750
撤空大楼
Evacuate the building.

434
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:35,500
DRN 停止前进 停止前进
DRN, halt advancement, halt advancement.

435
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,430
探长
Detective.

436
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,560
这是什么
What is it?

437
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,900
这不是炸弹
It's not a bomb.

438
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,650
这线通往另一处
That trip wire leads somewhere.

439
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,620
我带你去
I'll lead you in?

440
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,450
我不建议如此 长官
I do not advise that, sir.

441
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:10,640
我们走
Let's go.

442
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:34,630
沃格尔
Vogel.

443
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:36,450
救命
Help!

444
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:37,510
冷静
Stay calm.

445
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,320
肯尼思 救我
Kennex, help me!

446
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,650
救我
Help!

447
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:44,090
做点什么
Do something!

448
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:48,920
防弹玻璃
Bulletproof glass.

449
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,360
边缘被焊上了
It's welded shut.

450
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,540
我是帕特尔
Patel speaking.

451
00:27:58,550 --> 00:27:59,710
帕特尔 你在哪
Patel, where are you?

452
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:01,400
去安全屋的路上
En route to the safe house.

453
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:02,170
犯人在车里
We have the perp in the car.

454
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:04,420
好 赶紧掉头 这一切都是陷阱
Okay, turn around... this whole thing's a setup.

455
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:07,420
帕特尔 帕特尔
Patel, Patel.

456
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:14,760
不 不
No, no, no, no...

457
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:29,800
帕特尔队长和两名警察被杀
Sergeant Patel and two other officers were killed,

458
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,700
三个MX被摧毁 嫌疑人也逃跑了
three MXs were destroyed, and the suspect escaped.

459
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,110
是时候了
It's about time.

460
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,680
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

461
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,970
法医鉴定太慢了
Morgue lab is too slow.

462
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:04,700
找个试验箱 取点他的血样 带给鲁迪分析一下
Get a lab box, take a sample of his blood, and send it to Rudy for analysis.

463
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,460
不需要试验箱
Don't need a lab box.

464
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:22,340
我刚下载了资料
I just downloaded the information.

465
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,050
鲁迪现在应该有数据了
Rudy should have the data now.

466
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:26,930
为什么是他
Why him?

467
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,750
为什么攻击沃格尔
Why target Vogel?

468
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:39,050
搜索沃格尔接手的案件
Scan every case Vogel was on.

469
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:41,770
任何有关生物技术 科学 医药 DNA的案件
Any connection to biotech, science, medicine, DNA.

470
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:43,090
我都要看
I want to see it.

471
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:49,250
我不知道这是为什么
I don't know if this is anything,

472
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:51,010
但是他其中一个案件丢失了
but one of his files is missing.

473
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,880
案卷6663
Case file number 6663.

474
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,760
从内部资料丢失的
It's gone from all internal records.

475
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,410
等一下 沃格尔探员今早跟我说
Wait a minute, Detective Vogel told me this morning

476
00:29:57,410 --> 00:29:59,440
他不能用他的终端
that he couldn't get access to his terminal.

477
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,190
也许是带走他的人删掉了文件
Maybe whoever took him was deleting the file.

478
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,060
他们进入了整个系统
They got into the whole system.

479
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:06,830
他们是谁
Who is they?

480
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,990
看看楼下的人谁能把文件找回来
See if anyone downstairs can get that file back.

481
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:10,190
我就去
On my way.

482
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,660
你刚说的话...
The way you said that...

483
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:18,460
说明你已经有怀疑的人了
you're thinking someone specific is behind this.

484
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,340
是谁
Who?

485
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:21,410
我需要你帮忙时候 我会说的
When I want your help, I'll ask for it.

486
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,780
你知道你问题是什么吗
You know what your problem is?

487
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,330
我一天中最喜欢的是
Always my favorite part of the day:

488
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,190
让一个人造人告诉我 我有什么问题
a synthetic telling me what my problem is.

489
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:33,830
又是这个词
There's that word again.

490
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,680
你的问题是 你不了解你自己
Your problem is, you don't know yourself.

491
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,170
你不信任任何人
You don't trust anyone.

492
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,500
这是我的问题吗
Is that my problem?

493
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,210
伙计 我不是在责怪你
And, man, I don't blame you.

494
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,530
毕竟你经历了这么多
After all you've been through,

495
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:44,700
如果我是你 我也不会了解我自己
if I were like you, I wouldn't know myself either.

496
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,640
好吧 第一 别再说"伙计"
Okay, firstly stop saying "Man."

497
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,500
第二 你不像我
Secondly you're not like me.

498
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:49,910
但我也不像他们
And I'm not like them.

499
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:52,260
MX系列是基于逻辑判断和遵循规则的模型
MX units are logic-based and rule-oriented.

500
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,590
他们没有自由意志
They have no true free will

501
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:55,710
他们被设计成没有感觉
and they are designed to feel nothing.

502
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:57,190
我不能说我是生出来的
Now, I can't say that I was born,

503
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,540
我不能说我是在子宫里孕育或者拥有童年
I can't say I grew in a womb or had a childhood,

504
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:02,840
但我被做设计为拥有情感 我也确实有
but I was made to feel and I do

505
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,360
和你一样多
as much as you.

506
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,290
我读了你写的东西
I read what you wrote:

507
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:08,510
如果MX当初没有丢下你去救其他人
that if an MX hadn't left you behind to save some others,

508
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:11,210
你的搭档可能成功躲开那次伏击
your partner might have made it out of that ambush alive,

509
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:13,070
这部分可能是真的 
and that part may be true,

510
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:15,340
但是我读了整个报告
but I read the whole report.

511
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,700
那时伏击已经开始
By the time the ambush had begun,

512
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:19,210
已经来不及了 是你硬带他们去
it was already too late and it was you who led them in,

513
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:23,110
你可以责怪MX 也可以责怪你自己
so you can blame an MX or you can blame yourself.

514
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:23,730
好吧
Okay,

515
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:26,410
- 我和MX43不一样 - 你现在很显然出故障了
- I am nothing like an MX-43. - You're obviously malfunctioning right now.

516
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:27,980
- 你何不花几秒重启一下 - 不要这样跟我说话
- Why don't you just take a second to reboot yourself? - Do not talk to me that way.

517
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,890
- 就算有人出故障了 也是你肯尼思 - 你知道我将停止干什么
- If anyone is malfunctioning, it is you, Kennex. - You know what I'm gonna stop doing?

518
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:33,320
我将停止和一片硅胶和碳纤维争论
I'm gonna stop arguing with a piece of silicon and carbon fiber.

519
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:35,850
肯尼思
Kennex.

520
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:36,650
是鲁迪
It's Rudy.

521
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:40,060
警察局的所有警察被强制要求注射
All police in the department are required to have mandatory inoculation

522
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:42,870
警局实验室研发的疫苗 只对警官
designed in police labs for officers only.

523
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:44,810
这本来是为了保护警察的安全
Those inoculations are meant to keep cops safe.

524
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:49,230
免受生物战 毒气 致病菌等伤害
Protects against biowarfare, gases, pathogens, et cetera.

525
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:51,800
我们在沃格尔的血样里发现迈克隆红
We found Myklon Red in Vogel's blood,

526
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,750
结合了可编程DNA
combined with programmable DNA.

527
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,400
这样就直接攻击了疫苗
It targets the inoculation directly.

528
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,480
就像一次感染了上百种不同的疾病
It's like getting a hundred different diseases at once.

529
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:01,190
免疫系统变得狂躁
The immune system goes berserk.

530
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:02,240
你在说什么鲁迪
What are you saying, Rudy?

531
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,710
这就是为什么他的身体起那种反映
That's why his body reacted in the way that it did.

532
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:06,680
这就是为什么他死了
That's why he died.

533
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:10,200
我认为沃格尔探员是个试验体
I believe Detective Vogel was a test subject.

534
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,640
我们要对付的人...
Whoever we're up against...

535
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,170
他们目标是警察
They're targeting cops.

536
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,120
你去哪
Where are you going?

537
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:24,580
我不允许你这么做
I cannot allow you to do this.

538
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,490
这离上次才没多久
It's far too soon.

539
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,490
这是我的事 好吗
Look, this isn't about me, okay?

540
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:29,280
有人想杀光警察
Someone is killing police officers,

541
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,720
找到他们的唯一方法
and the only way we're gonna find them

542
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,840
就是我能记起更多参与这事的人
is if I remember more about the people who are doing it.

543
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,430
约翰 这不安全
John, it's not safe for you.

544
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:38,030
你就这么做 现在就做
You do this and you do it now.

545
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:49,920
他们早就等着我们送上门了 约翰
They were ready for us, John.

546
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,640
反联组织怎么知道我们要来
How did Insyndicate know we were coming?

547
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:54,060
他们怎么知道的 怎么...
How did they know? How'd they...?

548
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:59,400
回来 你个死机器人
Hey, come back here! You're damn rob...!

549
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:33,870
对不起
I am so sorry.

550
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:35,960
我告诉他这太危险了
I told him it was too dangerous.

551
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,810
你用了我的定位芯片
You used my locator chip.

552
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:54,200
马尔多纳多让我盯着你
Maldonado wanted me to keep an eye on you.

553
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:56,110
好吧
Okay.

554
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:04,530
能有一个软心肠的搭档 你很幸运
You're lucky you got the partner with the bleeding heart.

555
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,290
你在下面的时候看见了什么
What did you see... when you were under?

556
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:34,710
我看见我亲近的人
I saw someone who was close to me.

557
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:41,410
那个人 我现在才意识到不应该相信她的
Someone who, I realize now, that I should never have trusted.

558
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:47,030
我想说 虽然我不确定那是否是真的 但是...
I want to say I... I'm not even sure it's real, but...

559
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:51,900
但是是真的
But it was.

560
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:56,860
是谁呢 约翰
Who was it, John?

561
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,340
我前女友
It was my ex-girlfriend.

562
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,780
当我从昏迷中醒过来的时候 她已经消失了
When I came out of my coma, she had disappeared.

563
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,640
现在我知道原因了
Now I know why.

564
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:16,410
人造骨骼失灵
Synthetic fail.

565
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:18,020
需要校准
Calibration required.

566
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:20,530
人造骨骼失灵 需要校准
Synthetic fail. Calibration required.

567
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:21,980
我能解决这个问题
I've got a fix for that.

568
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:24,010
解决什么
What?

569
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:25,720
是不是有时会吱嘎作响
It gets creaky sometimes?

570
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,320
我有办法解决这个问题
I've got a fix for that.

571
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:28,660
用橄榄油
Olive oil.

572
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:30,840
橄榄油
Olive oil?

573
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,090
没错 你把橄榄油倒在关节的地方
Yeah, man. You put it right on the joint.

574
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,260
橄榄油
Olive oil?

575
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:35,700
你会感激我的
You'll thank me.

576
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,110
我想我...
I suppose I, uh...

577
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:49,220
我应该感谢你救了我
I should acknowledge the fact that you saved my life.

578
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,020
不用谢
No need.

579
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:57,290
我这么做只因为你是我唯一的机会
I only did it because you're my one ticket.

580
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:59,180
没有你 我就没法在这里
Without you, I'm off the force.

581
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:01,310
你该庆幸我太想当警察了
You're lucky I want to be a cop so bad.

582
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:10,740
你不像他们 那些MX机器人
You're not like them, the MXs.

583
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,550
我不知道为什么 但你就不像他们
I don't know why, but you're not.

584
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:14,660
你这应该是在表扬我吧
I should take that as a compliment.

585
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,020
没错
You should.

586
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:23,560
MX系列建立在一阶谓词演算之上
The MX series is based on first order predicate calculus.

587
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:26,740
MX没有知觉 你也可以说他们没有灵魂
MXs have no intuition, or as you might say, no soul.

588
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:30,690
对他们来说 经验 记忆都只是记录好的数据
For them, experience, memory is just recorded data.

589
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:33,240
我这个系列被设计用来归纳总结
My series is designed to draw conclusions,

590
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,740
做出推论
make inferences.

591
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,610
答案是沃格尔 对吧
The answer is Vogel, right?

592
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:42,050
谁在针对他 好处又是什么
Who was targeting him, what was the payback for?

593
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,140
是啊
Yeah.

594
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:45,750
我们唯一证人就是沃格尔的MX
And the only witness we have is Vogel's MX,

595
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,500
但在他们带走沃格尔的时候已经粉身碎骨了
Who was blown apart when they took Vogel.

596
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,770
是啊 鲁迪说他的神经网络已经彻底瘫痪了
Yeah, Ru-Rudy said his neural net was completely fried.

597
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:51,140
别的MX对此毫无办法
Worthless to another MX,

598
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:53,870
他们无法联系证据 理解证据
who wouldn't be able to-to put it together, to make sense of it,

599
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:55,780
但你可以建立起那些联系
but you could make those connections.

600
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,020
如果我们传送记忆
If we transferred the memory,

601
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:01,260
把沃格尔的MX残存的记忆传送给你
or whatever's left of the memory from Vogel's MX to you,

602
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,630
你就能够建立起连接
you could make the connection.

603
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:06,620
值得一试 探长
It's worth a shot, Detective.

604
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,760
买单啦
Check, please!

605
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:54,200
我在它的短时记忆中
I'm in its short-term memory now.

606
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:01,450
原地待命 很快回来
Stand by. I'll be back.

607
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:03,110
咖啡...糖...
...coffee... sugar.

608
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:06,300
沃格尔探员
Officer Vogel.

609
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,850
很高兴再次见到您
It's good to see you again.

610
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:11,550
几年前 你把一些不属于你的东西
A few years ago, you logged something into evidence

611
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:12,960
记录成证据
that doesn't belong to you.

612
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,170
你可能还记得6663号案件吧
You may remember it as case number 6663.

613
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:17,690
不记得了
No?

614
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,420
你们辖区的人一直很贴心地保管着它
Well, your precinct has been kind enough to hold it in evidence,

615
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:23,810
但今晚 我们要把它拿回来
but tonight, we're gonna get it back,

616
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,740
你会帮我们搞定
and you're gonna help us do it.

617
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:33,180
我们有他们要的东西
We've got something they want.

618
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,540
头儿 我们需要启动一级防范措施
Captain, we need to go into lockdown.

619
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,580
怎么了
What's going on?

620
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,620
他们今晚要攻击我们
They're hitting us tonight.

621
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,670
他们要在物证室找什么东西
They're after something in the evidence room!

622
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,360
打开吧 干掉所有MX
Light it up, take out the MXs.

623
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:22,140
反联组织的人在屋顶上
The Insyndicates are on the roof!

624
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:24,300
快啊 赶紧的 快快
Come on, now. Go, go, go, go, go!

625
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:26,730
疏散大楼
Evacuate building.

626
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:32,980
疏散大楼
Evacuate building.

627
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,560
为什么他们倒下了而你没有
Why are they shutting down and not you?

628
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,850
他们跟我在不同的频率上
They run on a different frequency than mine.

629
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,760
有时候更先进的科技不一定更好
Sometimes newer technology isn't better.

630
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,100
走吧
Come on.

631
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,490
打开阀门
Open the valves.

632
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:03,640
我们要自己动手一个一个检查
We got to go through every piece by hand.

633
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,390
我们都不知道要找什么呢
We don't even know what we're looking for.

634
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:06,490
我们知道它在这
We know it's here.

635
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:07,970
而且我们知道它肯定很重要
And we know it's valuable because they were willing

636
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:09,720
因为他们为了它杀了不少警察
to kill a lot of cops to get it.

637
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:14,850
肯定有某种方法能够让被消除的证据恢复
There must be some way to restore those evidence files that were wiped.

638
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,060
我在努力了 
I've been trying,

639
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:19,850
但破坏太彻底了
but the sabotage was extremely thorough.

640
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:24,430
我会继续努力
I'll keep trying.

641
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:27,640
谢啦 老兄
Thanks, man.

642
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:49,940
起来
Rise...

643
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:52,810
又一个好了
and be counted.

644
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:57,750
别惹麻烦
Stay out of trouble.

645
00:42:58,110 --> 00:43:00,550
你爸爸肯定会喜欢这个地方
Your father would have loved this place.

646
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:05,420
哦 我等不及要回到你的身边了
Oh, I can't wait to get back to you.

647
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:08,090
我知道我还得再等一个星期
I know I have to wait a week,

648
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:12,640
但是我真的很希望你能在这里陪着我
but what I really wish is that you were here with me.

649
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:22,120
我们会找到她的 约翰
We're gonna find her, John.

650
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,120
要是你没有回来...
If you hadn't come back...

651
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:38,930
你救了很多人的命
You saved a lot of lives.

652
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,550
谢谢
Thanks.

653
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,480
谢谢你的坚持
Thanks for insisting.

654
00:43:55,810 --> 00:43:58,970
是你申请的允许多利安服役的授权令
You put in the rec order... for Dorian.

655
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:00,370
我检查了他的记录
I checked out his record.

656
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:04,080
大部分被修改过 但我看见是你提出让我去找他的申请
It's mostly redacted, but I saw that it was you who put in the request for me to get him.

657
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,060
为什么
Why?

658
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:07,170
DRN对你有好处
The DRN is good for you.

659
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:12,670
桑德拉 
Sandra...

660
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:15,170
你没回答我问题呢
 you didn't answer my question.

661
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,510
为什么是多利安
Why Dorian?

662
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:18,630
因为他很特殊
'Cause he's special.

663
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:20,720
跟你一样与众不同
Just like you.

664
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,470
等下在点名时见
See you at roll call.

665
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:35,480
我猜你又需要安静模式了 探长
I assume you want quiet mode, Detective?

666
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:40,700
没必要了
Not necessarily.

667
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:45,850
叫我约翰吧
Call me John.

668
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,350
