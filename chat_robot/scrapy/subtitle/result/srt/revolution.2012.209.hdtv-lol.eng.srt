1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:03,310
Previously on Revolution...

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:04,970
What the hell is happening to me?

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:07,290
I'll come quietly! Just leave her alone!

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,720
I'd like to pick your brain about the nanotech.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,720
Aaron, it's only a matter of time - before Horn is onto you. - We gotta get you out of town.

6
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:18,960
Aaron!

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,860
Well, we have the doctor to thank for finding you.

8
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,980
Searching the boatyard was his idea.

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,020
Gene?

10
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:30,330
I know you all are in there. Get 'em out, Gene.

11
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,840
Let me stay behind.

12
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,390
We're working for the Patriots.

13
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,880
- So what now? - Kill them all for your mother.

14
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,890
You said your husband was Patriot High Command.

15
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:42,020
- What do you want? - Your wife...

16
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,690
is an enemy of the United States of America. You know how much trouble you're in now?

17
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,060
- I'm sorry. - Gotta be realistic.

18
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,310
Roger, no.

19
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:55,180
I have a tumor growing in my brain.

20
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,280
I need you.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,930
Aaron! Maybe you can heal someone else.

22
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:00,900
Stop!

23
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:02,520
No!

24
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:12,190
I saw an access door on the roof when I was up there.

25
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,540
So we go in up top, fight our way down.

26
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,980
There's gotta be 20 men in that bunker, and that's if we get past the 20 outside.

27
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,600
Aaron and Cynthia are in there,

28
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,110
probably your grandfather too. What choice do we have?

29
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:27,590
Miles...

30
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,090
You okay?

31
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,870
- Ready? - Yeah.

32
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,260
Miles?

33
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,770
What is it?

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,030
What the hell?

35
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,640
Are they dead?

36
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,180
Out cold.

37
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,920
Well, front door works too, I guess.

38
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,750
What the hell happened?

39
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,640
Were they gassed?

40
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,200
You haven't seen my dad, have you?

41
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,580
No. He's not here.

42
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,900
Hey, Miles.

43
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,860
- Aaron was here. - How do you know?

44
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,600
I know the boots he wears.

45
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,170
His prints go that way.

46
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,040
So...

47
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,160
Aaron knocks out 40 guys...

48
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:12,120
gets up, just strolls out of here.

49
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,210
Seriously... what the hell's going on?

50
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,190
It's this way. 

51
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,060
That's not ominous at all.

52
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,920
You think the Patriots made this?

53
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,520
Come on.

54
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,740
We're out of time, Rachel.
Wait, what about dad?

55
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,580
Now, let's go!

56

59
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,060
I said I'd bring you on my security detail,

60
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,300
not your son.

61
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,770
Jason only wants what I want...

62
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,250
to be of service.

63
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:33,170
He's an escapee from a reeducation center.

64
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:35,530
We all have skeletons in our closet.

65
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:36,760
Don't we, sir?

66
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,240
I helped you with yours,

67
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,160
I expect you to help me with mine.

68
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,450
Smile, boy.

69
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,320
We're going to the White House.

70
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,910
Sir.

71
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:22,390
Best we can tell, Pittman just walked out

72
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:25,580
through the tunnels, took his girlfriend with him.

73
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,590
The amazing Aaron Pittman.

74
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,580
No end to the surprises with that one.

75
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:46,590
Where are we?

76
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,760
Outside the town walls.

77
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:53,050
My question is, what are the Patriots doing with a tunnel like that?

78
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:55,200
All right, I got the trail. It's this way.

79
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:00,720
This weather seem a touch unseasonal to you?

80
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,060
So...

81
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:08,540
Aaron houdinis himself out of the bunker,

82
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,750
now this?

83
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,140
More of your nano garbage, isn't it?

84
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:18,980
Rachel?

85
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,800
- I gotta go back. - What?

86
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,750
You and Charlie, go get Aaron.

87
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,080
- I've gotta go get my dad. - Then I'm coming with you.

88
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,880
Uh, listen, both of you!

89
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,110
They're gonna be looking for Aaron.

90
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,940
Which means we gotta find him first.

91
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,490
- Then we'll go after Gene. - Miles.

92
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:45,650
All this X-Files weirdness...

93
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,010
not my thing.

94
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,630
Totally out of my depth here.

95
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,860
I need your help. What if he's dead?

96
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,610
If he is...

97
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,870
he did it to save us...

98
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,660
so that we could save Aaron.

99
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,770
And I'm sorry.

100
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,720
See what I mean?

101
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,150
We don't have a choice.

102
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:27,000
Cynthia.

103
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,830
Oh, thank God.

104
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,420
You're okay.

105
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,410
Did I do that?

106
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,570
Hello?

107
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,410
What are you doing here?

108
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:49,380
I'm having a heart attack. That's what I'm doing here.

109
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,900
What are you doing here?

110
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,820
I live here.

111
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,920
Well, did you... see who brought us in here?

112
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,490
You did.

113
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,510
You walked in on your own. She was in your arms.

114
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,100
Don't you remember?

115
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,610
No.

116
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,080
Damn it.

117
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,870
I lost the trail.

118
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,240
All right, well, find it.

119
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,040
Yeah, you know what, Miles, if you can do a better job,

120
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,410
please, go for it.

121
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,770
Shot fired!

122
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:06,270
- Over there! - Come on.

123
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:10,720
Hold it right there! Freeze!

124
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,970
I'm Batman.

125
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,570
Come on. Go!

126
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:45,720
Where's your father?

127
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,350
He went up front to see why we're stopping.

128
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,610
Sir.

129
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,890
Is she gonna be okay?

130
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,700
I hope so.

131
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,510
Have I seen you around town?

132
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:49,410
No.

133
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:51,930
'Cause you look familiar to me.

134
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,680
Where are your parents?

135
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,330
Been looking for them.

136
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:05,150
Where are you from? Oklahoma.

137
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,820
Town called Spring City. Ever been?

138
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,140
- No. - You should go.

139
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,290
It's got the second biggest ball of twine in the world.

140
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,900
Yeah.

141
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,170
Yeah, I'll do that.

142
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:47,030
Sir. Sir.

143
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,220
What?

144
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,990
I said maybe we should wait until the fog lifts,

145
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,640
until the scouts report in.

146
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,590
No.

147
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,360
Go get a horse, ride back to town.

148
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,490
Tell Truman to send everyone he's got.

149
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:07,030
I mean everyone.

150
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,750
I need to find Pittman now.

151
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:15,440
I'm out of time. Out of time?

152
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,910
Go.

153
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,630
What the hell happened, Bass?

154
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,030
Keep your voice down, they're right outside.

155
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,610
You were supposed to be looking after Aaron.

156
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,370
I did the best I could.

157
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,480
Well, your best sucks.

158
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,270
Now we gotta go find him. Actually, no, no.

159
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:47,050
You can take your fat friend, and these Patriots for that matter,

160
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:50,970
and you can shove 'em. I thought you wanted revenge.

161
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:55,090
What I want? The reason I saved you...

162
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:58,060
what I care about is my son, Miles.

163
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,740
You hid him from me.

164
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:03,590
Now you tell me where he is, and I'm out of here.

165
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,240
What?

166
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,720
Holy hell.

167
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:25,660
It's infected.

168
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,660
You think?

169
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,900
You're burning up, you moron. You need a doctor.

170
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,100
Doctor?

171
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,190
They've got Rachel's dad. Look.

172
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,300
I'm having a hard time swinging a sword.

173
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,870
- I need you. - No, you need help.

174
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,550
I gotta go find Aaron.

175
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:45,060
Look, Aaron... Aaron... he's nice and all.

176
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,160
But he's not worth dying over.

177
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,730
I disagree.

178
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:56,950
My God, you really have gone soft.

179
00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:00,190
You're like a puppy holding a kitten.

180
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:03,940
Just help me, okay?

181
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,700
And I swear I'll tell you where your son is.

182
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,520
No, this is not my problem.

183
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,290
Yes, it is.

184
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,630
Because if you don't help me,

185
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:18,400
I will never help you find your kid.

186
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,840
Look, mom, we'll go get Aaron,

187
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,600
and then we'll get grandpa, okay?

188
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,200
He'll be all right.

189
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,760
Yeah.

190
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:38,730
I just... th... the way we left things,

191
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,870
what I almost did to him...

192
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,360
I need to see him. I gotta talk to him, I have to tell him.

193
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,800
You will.

194
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,760
I love you, Charlie.

195
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:00,490
We may die tomorrow.

196
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,430
We'll probably die today.

197
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:05,770
Just, uh...

198
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,910
I need you to know that I love you.

199
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,500
I love you too.

200
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,710
Well? What are we waiting for?

201
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,120
Let's go find "Stay Puft".

202
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,590
（six）

203
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,850
Miles!

204
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:51,240
That's it? No good-bye?

205
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:05,290
We can't keep doing this. He's my brother.

206
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:11,530
And Ben's...

207
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,930
smart.

208
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,680
And he's good, he's a good man.

209
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,290
Better for you.

210
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:29,750
So, uh...

211
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,650
You should go start a family.

212
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:37,960
You know, be happy.

213
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,430
Is that how you really feel?

214
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,510
Yeah.

215
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:53,370
Because all you have to do...

216
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,950
is tell me you love me.

217
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,470
And I will leave him,

218
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,990
and I will wait for you.

219
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,370
I don't love you.

220
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,510
I don't believe you.

221
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,920
I'm sorry, Rachel.

222
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,170
I gotta go.

223
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,340
Sir!

224
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,520
I found him.

225
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,220
Get the United States back on its feet again.

226
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:44,290
We're proud of this job that we're doing here. It's gonna happen soon.

227
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:46,300
Please will you excuse me for a moment?

228
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,420
Of course.

229
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:33,800
Seem a little quiet to you?

230
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:38,960
The Patriots are gone.

231
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,800
They must have found Aaron.

232
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,830
They went this way.

233
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,550
Cyn, hi.

234
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,100
We're gonna get out of here, okay?

235
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,330
No. Don't go. Not yet.

236
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:09,320
All right, well, come with us.

237
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,160
But we gotta get as far away from here as we can.

238
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,110
I need to talk to you. Kid, I am sorry.

239
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:19,790
I don't have time for a chat right now. Aaron, who are you talking to?

240
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,040
The kid.

241
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:27,800
What kid?

242
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:32,500
The one standing right there.

243
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:39,220
Aaron, there's nobody there.

244
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:46,080
We fixed her. We brought you back to life.

245
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:48,650
We just wanna talk.

246
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,400
- Aaron, stop! - We're leaving.

247
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,180
- You saw a kid? - I didn't see anything.

248
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:03,210
Aaron, tell me!

249
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:08,140
I saw a boy.

250
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,870
And he said he brought me back to life.

251
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,670
And he said he wanted to talk to me.

252
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,230
Go talk to him.

253
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:24,740
Wait, what?

254
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:29,330
Look, these last few weeks have been truly awful.

255
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,850
But I still think... I have to believe

256
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:36,240
that everything happens for a reason, even this,

257
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,200
and you need to face it.

258
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,150
I don't think I can.

259
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:44,780
I'm scared too.

260
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,520
But you are gonna go back in there,

261
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,280
and I'm gonna be right beside you.

262
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:00,110
You're crazier than I am.

263
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,840
That's why you love me.

264
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,500
When I saw you on that platform,

265
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,530
I thought I was seeing a ghost.

266
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,670
Tom, is...

267
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:23,170
is Jason...

268
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:24,980
he's here.

269
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:27,400
With me.

270
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,830
Good.

271
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,200
You wanna tell me what happened?

272
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:43,150
Atlanta started to fall, so I headed south with Theresa.

273
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:47,230
We found a house in Sandersville.

274
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:49,660
I was there when the bombs fell.

275
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,160
Well...

276
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:57,420
Thank God you're alive.

277
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,960
Go ahead.

278
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:02,520
Say it.

279
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:08,570
Who is this ass-clown you're with?

280
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,260
He's my husband.

281
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:19,200
I thought you were dead, Tom.

282
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,930
I was scared, and I was hungry.

283
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:23,950
And so marry him...

284
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:27,350
is what I had to do to survive.

285
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,460
Do whatever it takes, right?

286
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:40,720
What are you doing here?

287
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,980
These are the son of a bitches who dropped the bombs.

288
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:47,640
I was on my way to the White House

289
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,270
to kill the President for you.

290
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,230
I love you.

291
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:06,340
You are not killing the President.

292
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:11,980
You're gonna keep your job, and for now,

293
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:15,240
both of us are gonna keep our mouths shut.

294
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:19,460
What do you have in mind?

295
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:25,590
We can still get everything we wanted.

296
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,930
（spring city）

297
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:40,890
Hello.

298
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:54,580
I thought you looked familiar.

299
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:04,260
You're Kevin Donegan...

300
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,330
my friend from... third grade?

301
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,880
You played Nintendo with Kevin.

302
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,550
Legend of Zelda.

303
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,470
How do you know about that?

304
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,120
We're everywhere.

305
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,930
We're in the air, we're in your head. We know your thinks.

306
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,740
My thinks?

307
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:33,070
You're the nanotech, aren't you?

308
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,520
So what are you telling me?

309
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:42,130
That you're some sort of A.I.?

310
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,780
That you're alive?

311
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,690
How?

312
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,440
We woke up. You woke us up.

313
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:58,200
（authorize）

314
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,140
What if we end the world?

315
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:06,050
We won't, Aaron. Do it.

316
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:25,660
I woke you up? You made us.

317
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,890
I've made a lot of things...

318
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:32,650
but never an A.I. Haley Joel.

319
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,770
What is this all about? What do you want from me?

320
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:40,110
Have you ever been to Spring City, Oklahoma?

321
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:42,540
It has the second biggest ball of twine in the world.

322
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:45,010
No. No riddles.

323
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:46,400
What is he saying?

324
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,230
I almost went nuts over this, and I want some answers.

325
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:54,750
I want straight answers. Why did you bring me back to life?

326
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:58,890
Why did you knock us out and sleepwalk us over here?

327
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:00,960
What is this all for?

328
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,910
You made us.

329
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:06,080
We just wanted to help you, that's all.

330
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:09,280
Burning people alive? That helps me?

331
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:12,450
You say "kill" in your head, so we kill.

332
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:14,910
Just because I think it doesn't mean...

333
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:19,670
look, stop killing people.

334
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:22,360
You wanna help me?

335
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:26,670
You leave me alone. Do you understand?

336
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,610
Go away.

337
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,700
Go.

338
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,830
They're here.

339
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:01,710
Cadet?

340
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,670
This is Mrs. Doyle.

341
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:13,430
She's a little turned around.

342
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:19,490
Can you help her get back to her husband?

343
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,080
Sir.

344
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:32,650
Follow me, Mrs. Doyle. Thank you.

345
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,320
Okay. Let's get Aaron.

346
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:39,540
Split up.

347
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:20,310
Aaron, you here?

348
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:34,970
Miles, are you okay? Miles?

349
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:35,770
- Sorry.- What?

350
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:36,960
 I'm sorry. 

351
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:39,390
What's wrong? You're burning up.

352
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:41,430
Don't freak out.

353
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,350
You gotta go.

354
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,790
Why didn't you tell me?

355
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:05,370
Well, we kinda had our hands full. I could've helped.

356
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:08,000
Your dad could've helped.

357
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,350
All you can do is act like an idiot, which is what you're doing right now.

358
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:13,220
Get out of here. You gotta go.

359
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:16,180
I am so sick of your macho cowboy crap.

360
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:19,910
You are not pushing me away this time.

361
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:22,700
I am not leaving.

362
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:33,020
Aaron?

363
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:40,800
Aaron?

364
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,080
（exit）

365
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,210
I gotta tell you something. You can tell me later.

366
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:37,560
No.

367
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,900
I'm gonna tell you now...

368
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,350
while I still can.

369
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:49,380
I ne... I never should've let you go.

370
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,680
You were always the one.

371
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:00,750
Miles?

372
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,580
Hey! Miles.

373
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,410
Miles, Miles, Miles. Come on.

374
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:07,780
Come on, wake up! Wake up, come on!

375
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,570
Mr. Pittman.

376
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,440
I've been looking for you.

377
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:33,510
Please just let us go.

378
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:37,070
I'd be happy to.

379
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:42,780
First, you get rid of the tumor in my skull.

380
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:46,570
I can't.

381
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:51,620
She was bleeding to death. You healed her, why not me?

382
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,610
You don't understand.

383
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:53,920
Stop lying!

384
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:59,950
You can't imagine what it feels like...

385
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:03,880
like a knitting needle jammed in my head.

386
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:05,820
I'm begging you.

387
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:08,590
Fix me.

388
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,220
Now.

389
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:13,410
Please.

390
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,880
Or I kill her.

391
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,090
Please. No. No.

392
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,230
You came back.

393
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:52,280
Go. Go!

394
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:30,780
- Please give me some time. - I'm out of time.

395
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:31,990
I'm gonna count to three.

396
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:33,990
- Kid, where are you? - One...

397
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:36,600
- I need help, please! - No one's coming to save you.

398
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,990
- Two... - It's not me doing it!

399
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:40,760
But I think I can figure it out if you just hold on.

400
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,540
- Please! - I love you.

401
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,640
Three.

402
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,320
Where were you?

403
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,580
You told me to go away.

404
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:00,610
Kill him.

405
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,200
Kill them all.

406
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:10,790
I don't understand. Why didn't you just ask me to heal her?

407
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:20,300
Yeah, I want you to heal her.

408
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:25,850
You tell me to leave, then you say come.

409
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:28,730
You say kill, then you tell me not to kill.

410
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:30,560
You don't make any sense.

411
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:32,910
Listen.

412
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:37,990
I... I want you to heal her.

413
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:47,310
Damn it, I am ordering you to hear her now!

414
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:50,860
I'm leaving, like you wanted.

415
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:52,440
No!

416
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:54,150
Wait!

417
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,280
Wait!

418
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:19,160
