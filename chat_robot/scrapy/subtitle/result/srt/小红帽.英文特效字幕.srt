{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Red Riding Hood, you probably know the story.

3
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,590
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But there's more to every tale than meets the eye.

00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:42,330
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's just like they always say, you can't judge a book by its cover.

5
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:47,540
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}If you want to know the truth, you've gotta flip through the pages.

6
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,420
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Granny!

7
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,460
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's me, Red!

8
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,670
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Is everything OK?

9
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:13,000
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, yeah, sure thing. Come on in.

10
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:14,630
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What?

11
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:17,800
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Who are you? - I'm your grandma.

12
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,400
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Your face looks really weird, Granny.

13
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,380
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I've been sick. I...

14
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,380
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Your mouth doesn't move when you talk.

15
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,380
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Plastic surgery. Grandma's had a little work done.

16
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,750
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Now, come on over here. Let's have a look at you.

17
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:34,160
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So, what's going on, Grandma?

18
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,190
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}This and that, doing a lot of quilting.

19
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,460
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So you got the loot?

20
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:42,160
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Whoa. What big hands you have.

21
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:45,670
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, all the better to scratch my back with.

22
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:49,300
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- And what big ears you have! - All the better to hear your...

23
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,570
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}...many criticisms!

24
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,910
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Old people just have big ears, dear.

25
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,570
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And Granny, what big eyes you have!

26
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:59,950
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Are we just gonna sit around here and talk about how big I'm getting?

27
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:04,680
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You came here for a reason. So tell old Granny what you got in the basket.

28
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,590
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ah, Granny! What bad breath you have!

29
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,130
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- All right! - Ah!

30
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:12,290
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You again? What do I have to do, get a restraining order?

31
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,700
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Settle down, little girl. I'm on to you.

32
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:16,860
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Hai-ya! - Save it, Red Fu.

33
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:20,200
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You been dodging me all day, but now you might as well give up.

34
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,540
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ahh!

35
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,230
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ha!

36
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,710
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You crazy wolf! What have you done with Granny?

37
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,370
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm taking Granny down, and you're next!

38
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,150
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Granny! - It's you! But you...

39
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,700
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Chief Grizzly, are the suspects

40
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,210
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- connected with the Goody Bandit? - Yeah, uh...

41
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,110
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No. Don't print that, Maxine. We don't know anything yet.

42
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,440
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Is the house made of gingerbread?

43
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,680
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Don't think so. - Do bears eat gingerbread?

44
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,450
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That's enough with the questions. Jerry, come on! Get these people back!

45
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,960
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}All right, back it up! Let the chief do his job!

46
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,080
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Come on, you, with the feathers, back behind the snake.

47
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,130
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I just want to go home and hibernate.

48
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,390
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Bill! - Chief!

49
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:22,370
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- All right, what do we got? - It's a domestic disturbance.

50
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:26,100
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Breaking and entering, wielding an ax without a license, intent to eat.

51
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,830
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I get it. Any connection with the recipe robberies?

52
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:32,640
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You mean the Goody Bandit? Could be. The house belongs to Granny Puckett.

53
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,270
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- The cookbook lady? - Yeah, that's the one.

54
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,040
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hmm.

55
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:43,150
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}OK, Paul Bunyan was swinging the ax, and Wolfie was trying to eat Lil' Bit.

56
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:46,710
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- All right, get a muzzle on that guy. - I can explain everything.

57
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,450
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You can explain it to the judge.

58
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:51,260
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Shouldn't you be in school? - Shouldn't I have a lawyer?

59
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:52,730
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Uh... What are you doing?

60
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,960
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Hey. We was just... - I was just smelling it.

61
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,930
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Don't eat that. That's evidence. - Right.

62
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,870
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}All right, so this looks pretty open-and-shut.

63
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:05,900
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Little Miss Rosy Cakes making covert deliveries to the goody tycoon,

64
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,710
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Wolfie tries to eat 'em both,

65
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:12,110
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}then Crazy Flannel Pants with the ax here busts in swinging vigilante-style.

66
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,810
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Take 'em downtown, boys.

67
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:16,290
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's the woods, chief. We don't have a downtown.

68
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,250
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You know what I mean. Just book 'em!

69
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,260
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Not so fast, Grizzly.

70
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,560
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That's the problem with you bears, always growling up the wrong tree.

71
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,690
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Hey, Nicky! - You on the case, Nick?

72
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,130
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No, just stopping by to have a sarsaparilla.

73
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,570
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Say, Tommy, you lose some weight?

74
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,000
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Uh, no. - Didn't think so.

75
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:39,770
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Nicky Flippers. What are you doing here? This is my case.

76
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,750
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, someone hibernated on the wrong side of the cave.

77
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,180
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I saw the lights, thought the circus was in town.

78
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,810
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Now, of course, I see I was right.

79
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:50,620
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You're too late, Nicky. I got this case all wrapped up.

80
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,590
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Is that right? - Yeah.

81
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,090
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}They got us all wrong, Mr. Flippers.

82
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,890
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, I don't know, you look pretty dangerous to me.

83
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,520
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- What's your name? - Red.

84
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,830
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- And why do they call you that? - Why do they call you "Flippers"?

85
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,360
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Go Flippers

86
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,000
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Jump! Get on! - Go Flippers

87
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,940
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Go Flippers Go Flippers

88
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:13,000
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Uh, no reason.

89
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,670
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}They call me Red because of this red hood I wear.

90
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:19,310
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- What about when you're not wearing it? - I usually wear it.

91
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,780
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Recipes have come up missing all over the forest.

92
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:24,550
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Goody shops have been going out of business for months,

93
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,020
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}and the trail ends here. I got a case to close.

94
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:31,620
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Slow down, chief. We've got four suspects, and that means four stories,

95
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:35,150
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}and if you get people talking long enough, someone will spill the beans.

96
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,860
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Beans? - Could I just make a quick phone call?

97
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,340
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Aaah!

98
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,200
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'll tell you what happened.

99
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,900
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What's with the handcuffs on a girl? Her wrists could slip right out.

100
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,500
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- How about a cage? - Bring in the cage!

101
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:53,140
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- I was being sarcastic. - Sarcasm. Strike the cage.

102
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:56,520
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}All right, get the cuffs off her.

103
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:02,860
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So, Red, why don't you explain how this all began?

104
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,590
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, like any other day.

105
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,150
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I was making deliveries for my Granny's goody shop.

00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,680
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'd rather you didn't.

228
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:09,310
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Red! Red Riding Hood!

229
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,260
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hand over the basket.

230
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:17,990
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Aaah!

231
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,360
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Red!

232
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:34,440
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You can't hold onto those recipes forever!

233
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:38,310
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'll get you, and your little Granny too!

234
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:43,180
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, that settles it.

235
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,850
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- We got our Bandit. - Could be.

236
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,390
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'd like to count my chickens after they hatch.

237
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,690
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Chickens?

238
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,820
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You've gotta admit, a wolf stopping kids in the middle of the forest...

239
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,630
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- That's pretty creepy. - Right. Yes, yes.

240
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,190
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But we don't arrest people for being creepy.

241
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,540
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yeah, Bruce. You know that guy we got in the tank?

242
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:03,800
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- The creepy one? - Yeah. Better let him go.

243
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,540
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So you went on to Granny's?

244
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:09,680
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I found an old trail up the north side of the mountain.

245
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,080
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hello!

249
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:46,010

250
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:50,990
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}@ But a mountain witch done put a spell on me 37 years ago

251
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:55,190
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}@ And now I gotta sing everything I say

252
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,280
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Everything? - That's right.

{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Granny? - What's that? Who's there?

258
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,670
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's Red. I'm on my way to come see...

259

265
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,990
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I've gotta find a way around the mountain, fast.

266

271
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:50,500
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}@ But when you're always singing you've got to live alone

272
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:53,680
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}@ That's why I made this mountain shack my home

322
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:33,000
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And then the axman cometh?

00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,170
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Arghh?

326
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,610
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Like a maniac.

327
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:45,110
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Wow. - Hmm.

328
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,740

330
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:55,250
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hold the phone, fuzzy-wuzzy. Let's hear it from the wolf's mouth.

331
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,200
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Don't I get a drink? - No!

332
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:09,240
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So, Mr. Wolf, may I call you "Wolf"?

333
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:12,300
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You can call me Sheila. I like long walks and fresh flowers.

334
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,810
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Quit playing around, Wolf!

335
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,240
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You're looking at three-to-five in an old shoe with no windows!

336
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:19,040
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So start singing!

337
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,640
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Your face looks familiar. - I get around the forest.

338
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,450
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What do you for a living, Mr. Wolf?

339
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,990
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm a shepherd. Hey!

340
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,620
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You might as well confess. I told them everything!

341
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:31,920
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Could you keep her away from me, please?

342
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,720
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I remember you.

343
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,920
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Three years ago on the Stiltskin case.

344
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,660
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You were snooping around for a lead on his real name.

345
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,930
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I was close too.

346
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,840
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I was gonna go with "Greg." Greg Stiltskin.

347
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,810
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Wait a minute, Flippers! You saying this guy's a cop?

348
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,210
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Worse. He's a reporter.

349
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,610
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- A what? - And I've got the real story.

350
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:03,520
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm an investigative journalist.

351
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:07,260
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You've probably read my column Facts and Fairy Tales.

352
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:12,830
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I spent the last six months undercover

353
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,740
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}investigating the so-called "Goody Bandit. "

354
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:18,600
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}As more recipes go missing, the trail has gotten hotter.

355
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,110
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Huh?

356
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:24,050
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And I'm talking hot coffee, hot coffee,

357
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:26,010
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}all over my neck. Very, very painful.

358
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,540
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}People think a health board examiner doesn't lead a dangerous life,

359
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,450
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}but I will tell you, my furry friend, food is dangerous.

360
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,990
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That's why Kenny told me to come and take a look.

361
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,530
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Who? - Your boss, Kenny.

362
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,790
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- You mean Earl? - That's what Earl said.

363
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:43,630
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He said, uh, "Kenny, come down here," and so, here I am.

364
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,400
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm surprised your dessert counter hasn't been hit,

365
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:48,300
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}with all the thievery going around.

366
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:52,470
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- What did you say your name was? - Shaw. Rick Shaw. I'm in from Japan.

367
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:55,310
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, Kenny, I'm gonna give you a clean bill of health.

368
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,850
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But I'm gonna need the names of all your suppliers.

369
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,410
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You'll have to talk to Earl.

370
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,850
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, that's Earl right now. Probably called the FDA.

371
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:07,520
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You keep that thing groomed. And watch out for hot coffee. Painful.

372
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:12,590
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No desserts. Waste of time.

373
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:17,100
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The little delivery girl in the red hood.

374
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,160
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Always on the go.

375
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,500
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}More goodies pass through her hands than anyone's in the whole forest.

376
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:24,800
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}She seemed happy...

377
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,170
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}...a little too happy, perhaps.

378
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,580
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh! Creepy.

379
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:36,180
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I was starting to have my suspicions.

380
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:39,750
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Question: Who does she move the goodies for?

381
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:43,020
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Where do they come from? Where are they going?

382
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:45,320
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And why the hood?

383
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,380
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Aaah!

384
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:49,630
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Twitchy, you scared me. - Hey, boss, I beeped you. Get my beep?

385
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,690
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Calm down. - I got up early. Got the gear.

386
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,860
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I was watching the girl like you told me to.

387
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:57,770
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Yeah. Did you see where she went? - Past porcupines and the bird's tree,

388
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,240
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}guy with the beard, now she's up the creek! She sings everywhere!

389
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:04,370
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm way ahead of you. We gotta find out who she's working for.

390
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:07,680
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- You got the camera? - The 220x and photograb with autofocus!

391
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,910
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Color or black and white? - Doesn't matter.

392
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:12,290
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- I brought a flash! - Put that away!

393
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,720
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- It's covert. No flash. - Undercover, got it.

394
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:17,390
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Nobody sees, nobody knows. Click-click. Hee-hee.

395
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,590
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You ever thought about decaffeinated coffee?

396
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,260
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I don't drink coffee!

397
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,430
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hmm...

398
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:28,170
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Excuse me. Pardon me. Pardon.

399
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,970
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I decided to get the word on the street from one of my top informants.

400
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,030
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- How's it going, Woolworth? - Man, what are you doing here?

401
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:38,780
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The shepherd comes by and sees me talking to you, I'm gonna get the crook.

402
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:42,220
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yeah? There's a bigger crook on the loose that I'm concerned about.

403
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:45,380
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- What ya hear about the Goody Bandit? - What do I know?

404
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,420
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hiya, Twitchy.

405
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:50,950
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- The little girl in the red hood. - Don't know, never heard of her.

406
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:54,420
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Little Red? Processing...

407
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,730
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yeah, yeah, it's coming back to me now. Sweet gal. Not like that Bo Peep.

408
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,000
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Brat put in an invisible fence. I tasted my own fillings for a week!

409
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,470
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Focus! The girl in the hood.

410
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:06,170
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You get around the mountain. Who does she work for?

411
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,370
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}How should I know? I ain't that curious.

412
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:11,470
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Family business. Ain't you ever heard of Granny Puckett?

413
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,850
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Puckett? - Her grandma.

414
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,180
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The Granny Puckett? You pulling the wool over my eyes?

415
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:19,220
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ha-ha. Hilarious. Come up with that yourself? That's funny.

416
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,620
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- You're looking pretty tasty. - Why you gotta be like that?

417
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:25,490
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}All I know is that the old lady lives up high in the hills.

418
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,000
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Not a lot of visitors. - Except the little girl.

419
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:30,900
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}She's been known to take the cable car up the mountain.

420
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:31,990
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Cable car?

421
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,930
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Those sheep made me hungry. After this, we're grabbing a bite.

422
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:38,670
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sounds good. Sounds good.

423
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:47,820
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I don't know what to do. Should I call her?

424
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,250
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Am I supposed to play it cool? - Keeping her options open.

425
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,020
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Seeing other people. You should do the same.

426
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:55,490
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Shh. Up there.

427
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:58,050
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Do you mind?

428
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,220
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ooh. Sorry.

429
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,900
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hey, you deliver up this far?

430
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:11,770
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The Muffin Man... Granny's recipes...

431
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,040
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}...an evil plan.

432
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:15,940
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}...shut down everyone in the forest...

433
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:17,270
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I knew it.

434
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:20,810
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}She's working for the old lady. Twitchy.

435
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:29,860
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Aaah!

436
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,290
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ooh! Uhh!

437
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,020
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Uhh! Ooh! Ugh!

438
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,070
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ouch!

439
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,550
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}'Afternoon.

440
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:58,880
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hello.

441
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,950
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So you're the little girl in the red hood.

442
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,250
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That's quite a bit of falling you did just now.

443
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,450
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Gravity's working.

444
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:08,560
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What are you doing in the big, bad forest?

445
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:11,730
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You taking goodies to someone in particular?

446
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,170
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Um... Granny.

447
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,870
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You don't have anything else in that basket?

448
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:21,470
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- You ask a lot of questions, mister. - Well, I'm a curious guy.

449
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:24,710
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Let me have a look. - I'd rather you didn't.

450
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,420
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I mean, "please." Come back here!

451

453

{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We'll never catch her.

00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,930
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Whoa! That was her. We passed her. Right here's fine.

456
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:55,770
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Suspect is approaching on foot, stolen recipes in basket.

457
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:58,580
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm about to catch her red-handed.

458
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,670
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hand over the basket!

{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What? They're evil. I'll prove it!

{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Maybe a side of unemployment? 'Cause that's what's for lunch.

476
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:11,510
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- What do we do? - We go right to the source.

477
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,610
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We gotta get to Granny's before the kid.

479
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:19,850
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You're going over to Granny's house to surprise Red. Is it her birthday,

480
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:23,370
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}or what is it? Is there a shindig? 'Cause I'm great at parties.

482
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:29,040
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Big surprise party. You know how to get there?

483
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:31,230
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, yeah. Yeah. In fact, I know a shortcut.

484
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,140
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You hear that? He knows a shortcut.

485
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:35,370
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Over the woods and through the river...

486
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:38,570
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No, you don't want to go through the river, you'll get all wet.

487
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:41,740
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You see, Twitchy, you get lemons, you make lemonade.

488
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:47,220
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And then that lemonade goes bitter and ferments and turns to pig swill.

489
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:49,820
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Never trust a bunny with directions, Twitchy.

490
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:51,760
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sure thing, boss. Never trust a bunny!

491
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:54,300
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The bright side is, at least I finally dried off.

492
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,800
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ohh!

493
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:59,700
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Why couldn't I write movie reviews?

494
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:01,830
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We are in a pickle, and I blame myself.

495
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:06,000
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That bunny was worthless, not to mention he wrote directions on an Easter egg,

496
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,310
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- which is hard to read. - We're gonna die here!

497
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,970
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hey, now, that's what they said at The Alamo.

498
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:15,240
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Wha... what was that? Who's that?

499
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,550
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Aaah!

500
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,180
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Uhh!

501
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,820
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hey, look where we are. More cave.

{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}you will learn to speak. Look! A way out.

504
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,520
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But I was just... Ahh!

505
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:39,670
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Follow me.

506
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,780
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hmm...

507

{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Huh? - Come on.

508
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:51,520
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}@ Train

509
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,650
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}@ Train

511
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,300

512
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:05,360
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Whazzat? Sounds like an avalanche!

513
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,340
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, Twitchy, that's natural.

514
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,840
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's just Old Man Mountain showing us who's boss.

515
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,270
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hey, lookie! A box of candles! A big box!

516
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:18,470
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Box of candles? Light 'em up!

517
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,510
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Wow, that's nice and bright. What kind of candles are those?

518
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:26,350
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Deen-a-meet-tay. Must be ltalian. - Ah! Lose the candle!

519

{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- But l... - Ahhh!

{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Got it.

521
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,740
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Did you hear something? - Hm?

522
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:56,750
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hm. Come on, let's get to Granny's.

523
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:59,850
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hello! Paper boy.

524
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,020
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Publisher's, uh...

525

526
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:08,700
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What do we do, boss?

527
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,060
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ohh!

528
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:16,940
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Lucky for me, Granny keeps her merchandise around the cottage.

529
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:19,530
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Disguise was the only way to catch this girl

530
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:21,170
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}in the act of smuggling.

531
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,970
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sweetie-pie! Sugar plum!

532
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,450
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hug your granny, little pudding pop.

533
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,210
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Aww!

534
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:32,190
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Boy, that's hot. OK, change of plans.

535
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,190
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- You can be Granny. - [knocking]

536
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,520
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}She's coming!

537
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:37,150
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Wa-dee-dee! - Ohh!

538
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:39,460
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Granny! It's me, Red.

539
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:42,760
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Is everything OK? - Yeah, sure thing. Come on in.

540
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:44,230
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Pretty thin, Wolf.

541
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,790
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You said the old lady was already tied up.

542
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:48,930
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- How did that happen? - I don't know,

543
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:50,940
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}maybe to make herself look innocent.

544
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:53,370
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I just write the news, chief, I don't make it.

545
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,240
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}For a reporter, you have a strange way of doing your job.

546
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:58,910
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What can I say? I was raised by wolves.

547
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:05,880
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Got a way to back this up? - I got these pictures developed.

548
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,010
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That so? Let's have a look.

549
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,620
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}These are good.

550
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:12,960
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Here's a nice one of you, Wolf. - Ugh!

551
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:15,460
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I wanna do a gallery show. A coffee table book.

552
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:17,630
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I don't drink coffee. A Chai tea latte book.

553
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,630
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Photos don't lie, chief.

554
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,470
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Good work, Twitchy. - Arghh.

555
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:24,200
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Now, I want to know more about this fellow with the ax.

556
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:26,670
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}How does he fit into all of this?

557
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:30,010
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Maybe you should "ax" him yourself.

558
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,680
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You see? "Ax" him? He was saying...

559
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,950
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'll bring him in.

560
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:43,090
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hmm. Hello.

561
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:46,190
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}My, my. You're a big fellow, aren't you?

562
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:50,360
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Shop at the Big and Tall store? - This is a big and tall mistake.

563
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:52,400
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I would not hurt a butterfly.

564
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,370
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Then what's this? A letter opener?

565
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,370
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That's a funny accent you got there, choppy.

566

571
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:12,350

603
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:54,750

628
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,290
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}and we can all work for that little guy.

633
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:23,770
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}and we think we might have a real "Hercules goes bananas" angle on this.

646
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:57,280
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Don't act like a woodsman, be a woodsman. Got it?

{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yes.

680
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:17,280
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Because you were pretending to be a woodsman.

681
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:19,340
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- That's right! - To sell foot cream.

682

00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,790
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, I think it's safe to say that our thespian friend here

00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:28,490
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}knows the least about anything of anyone in this room.

686
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,760
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Exactly! What does that mean?

687
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:33,630
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That it all points to Granny.

688
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,800
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What about it, Granny?

689
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:42,330
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Maybe you're not the sweet goody-maker everyone thinks you are.

690
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:45,810
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Are you stealing recipes to protect your sugar-coated kingdom?

691
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,440
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, no, Mr. Flippers.

{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}My granny doesn't keep secrets.

695
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:00,890
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And even if she did, she'd tell me about it.

696
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,690
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We tell each other everything. Right, Granny?

697
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:07,500
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sure, dear. Mostly.

699
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:15,510
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}My family worries too much. I didn't want them to find out.

700
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:18,980
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Find out what? - Yeah. What?

701

703
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:30,980
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}When did they make that a sport?

704
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:37,320
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I noticed you have three G's tattooed on the back of your neck.

705
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:42,700
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That's appropriate, since there are three strikes against you.

706
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:46,010
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's true.

707

{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm not like other grannies.

708
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:53,840
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I never did like the quilting bees and the bingo parlors.

709
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,350
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'd rather live life to the extreme.

00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:51,410
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Is it a flush that beats a full house? - No, that's a full house.

907
00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:53,520
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- It's not my turn? - I know about houses.

908
00:53:53,590 --> 00:53:56,030
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I built mine out of straw. I'm not an idiot.

909
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:58,590
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Am I gonna get to put the cuffs on someone, or what?

910
00:53:58,670 --> 00:53:59,660
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Remember, Ted,

911
00:53:59,730 --> 00:54:03,570
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}pieces of a puzzle make funny shapes, but they still fit together in the end.

912
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,800
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Boy, you're just full of those, aren't you?

913
00:54:05,870 --> 00:54:09,040
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We are closer to the Bandit than we've ever been before, chief.

914
00:54:09,110 --> 00:54:12,710
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The clues to find him are right here in this room.

915
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:15,610
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}In this room? That's what I've been saying!

916
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,880
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Are you telling me we're back to square one?

917
00:54:17,950 --> 00:54:20,110
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hold on, Smokey. Where's the fire?

918
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:22,780
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Timmy, it's Tommy. You there? Over.

919
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:25,090
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Am I talking to the wall?

920
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:27,420
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}If you don't have your walkie, don't talk to me,

921
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,360
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}but if you got your walkie, let's talk.

922
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:32,130
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Put everybody in cuffs. I'm taking them all in.

923
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:34,790
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's what I do, that's why I'm police chief.

924
00:54:34,870 --> 00:54:38,330
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Timmy, it's Tommy. Pick up. If you're there, pick up the walkie.

925
00:54:38,410 --> 00:54:40,930
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What are you doing this weekend? Over.

926
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:44,440
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We've got this place locked down, all secured.

927
00:54:48,550 --> 00:54:52,650
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It would seem that all of you came together tonight by mistake.

928
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:57,690
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Maybe you naughty neighbors butted heads so we could get to the real truth.

929
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,590
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- The Goody Bandit. - That's right.

930
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:02,650
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The Bandit's still at large.

931
00:55:02,730 --> 00:55:05,130
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}There's been a lot of finger-pointing tonight,

932
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,220
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}but now all fingers point to the Bandit.

933
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:09,500
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Not my finger! - Oh, no,

934
00:55:09,570 --> 00:55:12,370
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}you were just out damaging forest property,

935
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:14,770
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}cutting down the redwoods we all call home.

936
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:17,870
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Big guy like you, you could probably take whatever you want

937
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:19,970
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}from little goody-loving creatures.

938
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:23,640
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But someone robbed me! Have we lost track of that?

939
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,050
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That's right, someone did.

940
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:28,950
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Maybe a snack food competitor.

941
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:30,750
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Right, Granny?

942
00:55:30,830 --> 00:55:33,020
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Now, hold on a pea-picking minute!

943
00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:36,890
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I may lead a double life full of secrets and deception,

944
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,460
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- but that's no reason to be suspicious. - Huh?

945
00:55:39,530 --> 00:55:43,130
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}A woman like you could have a lot to gain stealing all those recipes.

946
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:46,660
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And that's how she makes her goodies so good! Huh?

947
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:50,040
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Or she could just be another victim...

948
00:55:50,110 --> 00:55:53,010
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- What? -...of a hungry wolf!

949
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,070
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The wolf did it. Talk about profiling.

950
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:58,140
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Why should we trust someone who wears disguises for a living?

951
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:01,880
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Maybe he's not a wolf at all! - You got me. I'm a poodle.

952
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:05,590
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Just haven't been to the barbershop. - Is this all just a big joke to you?

953
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:09,220
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- I just followed the girl here. - You leave my granddaughter alone!

954
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:12,660
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yes, now we get to Little Red,

955
00:56:12,730 --> 00:56:15,260
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}the girl with the basket on the run.

956
00:56:16,570 --> 00:56:19,510
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Where is she, anyway? - I was just...

957
00:56:19,570 --> 00:56:22,540
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The recipes are gone!

958
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:35,990
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Are you saying Red is the Bandit? - Not my Red!

959
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:38,190
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Calm down there, Triple G.

960
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:40,660
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The only thing your granddaughter is guilty of

961
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:43,060
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}is flying hummingbirds without a license.

962
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:46,690
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It would seem there is another player in this game,

963
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:50,640
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}someone who's hippity-hopped his way through all of your stories.

964
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:57,600
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yes, there's someone else.

965
00:56:58,810 --> 00:57:01,980
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The only one who was with Red when she fell...

966
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:04,880
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Ohh! - No!

967
00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:06,920
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}...who knew a shortcut to Granny's...

968
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:08,780
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, yeah. In fact, I know a shortcut.

969
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:11,830
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}... who fraternizes with evil ski teams...

970
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:16,090
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- What's your name? - Put, "To my biggest and cutest fan."

971
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:18,260
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}...and someone who was there

972
00:57:18,330 --> 00:57:20,560
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}when the schnitzel truck was schnitzeled.

973
00:57:20,630 --> 00:57:21,760
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What the schnitzel?

974
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,770
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Not the bunny!

975
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:27,140
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- I knew it. Never trust a bunny. - Never trust a bunny!

976
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:28,330
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Uh, chief. - Yeah?

977
00:57:28,410 --> 00:57:32,000
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No one's seen the bunny or the girl, and that cable car left the station.

978
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:35,570
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I think we need an APB out on something small and fuzzy.

979
00:57:35,650 --> 00:57:36,740
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I think you're right.

980
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:39,910
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Get your boys to Red's place. We need to head off that cable car.

981
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:43,350
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And bring in a police sketch artist. No, make it a cartoonist.

982
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:46,690
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We gotta hurry to beat it down. Bill, get everyone in the cars.

983
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:49,630
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Tommy, you can bring that evidence with you. Let's go!

984
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:53,260
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- You heard the chief, let's move it! - Not in the same car!

985
00:57:53,330 --> 00:57:55,700
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Keep it moving. There's nothing to see.

986
00:57:55,770 --> 00:57:58,330
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Who's got my keys? - Shotgun.

987
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,870
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Did you get any shots of the bunny? - The bunny? Why?

988
00:58:05,950 --> 00:58:08,920
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I told you to take pictures of everything!

989
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:13,250
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ohh! We gotta get this to print before it's all over the forest!

990
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:16,550
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Something don't sit right in my bones about this.

991
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:22,020
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- What's that? - Maybe it's your bones.

992
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:24,500
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I smell schnitzel.

993
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:29,930
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What have they done to my schnitzel truck?

994
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:37,010
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Why are they going up?

995
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:40,510
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}There's on old cable car station at the top of the mountain.

996
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:44,380
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We've got to follow them, boys. Red's up there. I know it!

997
00:58:44,450 --> 00:58:47,220
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Get down the mountain. You gotta stop those cops.

998
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:49,760
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Run 'em off the road, dangle a donut, I don't care.

999
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:53,220
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Tell 'em they're going the wrong way. - Eezie-peezie! Leave it to me!

1000
00:58:53,290 --> 00:58:55,560
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You'll never catch 'em in time.

1001
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:59,090
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Is that coffee?

1002
00:58:59,170 --> 00:59:02,620
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I can't believe I'm saying this, but... drink up.

1003
00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:06,800
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We may want...

1004
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:08,940
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}...to stand back.

1005
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:19,610
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yee-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1006
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,510
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Caffeine! Yeah, baby!

1007
00:59:23,590 --> 00:59:25,820
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Whoa! - Go get 'em, boy.

1008
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,130
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What...

1009
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:38,400
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-... have I done? - Now the rest is up to us.

1010
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:40,870
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Can I have coffee?

1011
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,620
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I don't like it. The cops are all over the place.

1012
00:59:59,690 --> 01:00:00,890
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Forget about the cops!

1013
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:03,260
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We've got everything we need right here.

1014
01:00:03,330 --> 01:00:06,060
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What about the old lady? If she's alive, she'll be back.

1015
01:00:06,130 --> 01:00:09,570
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You just don't get it, do you, Dolph? I'm done!

1016
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:12,260
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm done dancing for the man!

1017
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:14,810
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The Muffin Man and Granny!

1018
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,810
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}They can both take a hike!

1019
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:22,210
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm never gonna answer to anyone ever again!

1020
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:33,150
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ah, I just love my job!

1021
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:35,090
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You see how it works, Dolph?

1022
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:38,460
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You prioritize, you set your goals, you write a mission statement.

1023
01:00:38,530 --> 01:00:42,590
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You ask yourself, "Where do I see me in five years?"

1024
01:00:42,670 --> 01:00:44,860
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}How about behind bars?

1025
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:48,640
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Red! Oh, hi, Red! What are you...?

1026
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:53,110
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- You've spoiled the surprise. - You're the Bandit.

1027
01:00:53,610 --> 01:00:55,240
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Surprise!

1028
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:57,650
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm walkin' out of here with those recipes.

1029
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:59,020
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Really? - Yeah.

1030
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:02,720
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You're a bad bunny.

1031
01:01:02,790 --> 01:01:06,060
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, somebody's finally catching up!

1032
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:10,830
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Did you think I followed you around on your deliveries because I liked you?

1033
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:18,360
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, you best be fearing the ear, baby.

1034
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:22,100
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ahh!

1035
01:01:25,110 --> 01:01:27,240
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hai-yahh!

1036
01:01:27,310 --> 01:01:28,580
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Is that all you got?

1037
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:33,440
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Ohh! - Ha! You hit like a girl!

1038
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:38,020
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Come on.

1039
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:44,260
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And ka-blam!

1040
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:51,070
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Why don't you go home and cry to your granny?

1041
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:53,900
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Dolph, tie up the brat. Lesa, hold the book.

1042
01:01:53,970 --> 01:01:56,200
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Vincent, get the truck. And Keith...

1043
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:58,840
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Darn it, change your name. Please.

1044
01:01:58,910 --> 01:02:01,750
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That's not scary, and I'm embarrassed to say it.

1045
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:04,750
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Boris. Try that. - Hmm.

1046
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:06,290
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Keith. You know?

1047
01:02:06,350 --> 01:02:09,450
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, watch out for Keith.

1048
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:12,720
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- You're crazy! - Maybe so.

1049
01:02:12,790 --> 01:02:16,490
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But I'm top of the woods now, baby!

1050
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:20,090
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}@ When you're

1051
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:22,530
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}@ Hopping on down the bunny trail

1052
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:24,700
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}@ The critters all seem to look down

1053
01:02:24,770 --> 01:02:27,430
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}@ You're fuzzy and small Your ears are too tall

1054
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:29,840
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}@ And goodies make the woods go round

1055
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:31,970
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}@ Now, I'm not a pig But you gotta think big

1056
01:02:32,050 --> 01:02:34,640
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}@ When you're competing with the girl in the hood

1057
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:37,280
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}@ So you won't be a fan of my evil plan

1058
01:02:37,350 --> 01:02:39,910
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}@ But I'm gonna be top of the woods

1059
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:43,120
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}@ Now the kids will be packed with my Boingo snacks

1060
01:02:43,190 --> 01:02:44,660
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}@ Construction begins in a day

1061
01:02:45,190 --> 01:02:47,790
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}@ And all of the bears will be ruled by the hare

1062
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:52,390
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}@ As I maniacally plot from my evil lair

1063
01:02:58,410 --> 01:03:03,340
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We've really grown in the past year. Nabbing all the recipes was phase one.

1064
01:03:03,410 --> 01:03:06,680
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Now phase two is adding my own special ingredient

1065
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:07,910
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}to every goody.

1066
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:11,350
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}A little something I like to call "Boingonium."

1067
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:14,820
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It makes my snacks a little more... habit-forming.

1068
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:18,220
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Happy customer!

1069
01:03:18,590 --> 01:03:20,820
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Phase three gets a little messy.

1070
01:03:20,890 --> 01:03:23,660
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm gonna need a lot of real estate down the mountain,

1071
01:03:23,730 --> 01:03:25,630
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}so I've gotta blow the competition away.

1072
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:27,130
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, and that's not a metaphor.

1073
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,690
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We've literally got to blow them away. OK?

1074
01:03:29,770 --> 01:03:31,360
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yeah, I got it.

1075
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,460
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And now that I have your granny's secrets,

1076
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:38,100
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm afraid you'll be taking the dyno-mite express home.

1077
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:44,320
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}@ You won't be disrespecting this bunny no more

1078
01:03:44,380 --> 01:03:47,050
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}@ 'Cause I'm gonna be top of the woods Oh, yeah

1079
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:49,020
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}@ I said I'm gonna be top of the woods

1080
01:03:49,090 --> 01:03:50,420
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}@ Let's bring it on home!

1081
01:03:50,490 --> 01:03:54,320
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}@ I said, I'm gonna be

1082
01:03:54,390 --> 01:03:57,590
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}@ Top of the woods

1083
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:02,460
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}@ You've been hoodwinked, baby!

1084
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:07,130
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}@ Oh, yeah @

1085
01:04:07,270 --> 01:04:10,270
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sweet tea and cookies! We got to do something!

1086
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:11,330
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I know.

1087
01:04:11,410 --> 01:04:15,310
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The song was catchy, but the choreography was terrible.

1088
01:04:16,350 --> 01:04:17,410
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}OK, listen.

1089
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:20,080
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I have an idea, but we need to get past that ski team.

1090
01:04:20,150 --> 01:04:24,110
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The toughest one is the big fella, really mean-looking,

1091
01:04:24,190 --> 01:04:28,030
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}with a fat head and a thick skull. Looks like a shaved ape.

1092
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:30,960
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I mean, he is u-u-u-ugly!

1093
01:04:31,030 --> 01:04:34,430
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Like a big, swollen, overgrown...

1094
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:36,530
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He's standing right behind me, isn't he?

1095
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:38,760
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Mm-hm. - Ahh!

1096
01:04:51,450 --> 01:04:52,920
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ohh! Ohh!

1097
01:04:52,990 --> 01:04:54,820
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Whoa!

1098
01:04:54,890 --> 01:04:55,910
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Whew!

1099
01:04:55,990 --> 01:04:59,390
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Who taught you how to drive? - Almost hit a squirrel. That was close.

1100
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,430
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What's the big idea?

1101
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:12,700
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I could've made road pizza out of you, kid!

1102
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:18,370
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- What's he saying? - What is it, boy?

1103
01:05:18,450 --> 01:05:21,610
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Truck. Trouble at the mill!

1104
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:23,880
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Is the barn on fire?

1105
01:05:23,950 --> 01:05:27,150
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The barn's on fire! The well! Timmy's stuck in the well!

1106
01:05:27,220 --> 01:05:31,380
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hold on. He seems to be speaking words of some kind.

1107
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:32,820
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Pffsst!

1108
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:36,420
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You're a delivery girl. Then could you do me a favor?

1109
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:38,520
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Could you take this down the mountain?

1110
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:41,900
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}'Cause it absolutely, positively has to be there tonight!

1111
01:05:41,970 --> 01:05:44,600
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm sorry. What? I can't quite... with the...

1112
01:05:44,670 --> 01:05:49,070
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You got something right there across your mouth!

1113
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:52,810
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You're an actor, right? So this is your big part.

1114
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:56,010
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}This is the role of a lifetime. Make them believe in you.

1115
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:59,180
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Don't act like an evil henchman, be an evil henchman. Got it?

1116
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:01,480
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Know what you're gonna say, right? - Right!

1117
01:06:03,290 --> 01:06:06,160
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Mr. Rabbit? - Dolph! Where have you been?

1118
01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:09,750
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You nim-witted Eurotrash with the... What is that, a ski mask?

1119
01:06:09,830 --> 01:06:12,660
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I like that. See, that's scary. That's good.

1120
01:06:12,730 --> 01:06:15,930
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Boss... - What? Say it! Spit it out!

1121
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,370
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- What's going on? - Boss...

1122
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:22,140
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Paul's Bunion cream has the soothing formula...

1123
01:06:22,210 --> 01:06:25,610
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hi there. What he means to say is that I'm the building inspector.

1124
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,540
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Yes. - I just need to tap the pipes

1125
01:06:27,610 --> 01:06:29,280
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}to see if your wiring's up to par.

1126
01:06:29,350 --> 01:06:33,880
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold it. You're not... No. You can't touch anything in here.

1127
01:06:33,950 --> 01:06:35,390
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Let's walk.

1128
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:39,460
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Let me level with you. You're an evil genius, right?

1129
01:06:39,530 --> 01:06:43,990
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, I don't know if I'd say genius, you know.

1130
01:06:44,060 --> 01:06:45,690
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I was asked to join Mensa.

1131
01:06:45,770 --> 01:06:48,500
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You got an evil lair in a cave, that's standard,

1132
01:06:48,570 --> 01:06:51,400
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}but see, most masters of evil that we deal with

1133
01:06:51,470 --> 01:06:53,800
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}are up to evil genius code.

1134
01:06:53,870 --> 01:06:55,810
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Are you familiar with the code?

1135
01:06:55,880 --> 01:07:00,310
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You know, I'm more of a do-it-yourself kind of guy. Yeah.

1136
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:03,080
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I understand. Thinking about putting in a laser?

1137
01:07:03,150 --> 01:07:05,640
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I don't know. I don't... Do you think I should?

1138
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:08,850
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, it's standard equipment for a cave lair.

1139
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:11,320
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm not saying you're gonna zap someone today,

1140
01:07:11,390 --> 01:07:14,790
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}but you gotta think about the future. They gotta be calibrated.

1141
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:18,820
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- You gonna do that yourself? - Well, l... I...

1142
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:21,090
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We should take a look at that power grid.

1143
01:07:21,170 --> 01:07:23,470
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}OK. Yeah, sure, sure.

1144
01:07:31,010 --> 01:07:32,440
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Wait a minute.

1145
01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:36,570
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I smell hairspray.

1146
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:43,150
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Come here, you little bunny!

1147
01:07:45,860 --> 01:07:48,020
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Huh?

1148
01:07:49,930 --> 01:07:51,690
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ooh!

1149
01:07:51,770 --> 01:07:52,860
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Whoo!

1150
01:07:52,930 --> 01:07:54,200
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ha-ha!

1151
01:07:54,270 --> 01:07:55,930
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Gotcha!

1152
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:04,110
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Get over here!

1153
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:07,080
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Aahhh! - [bike bell rings]

1154
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:11,480
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hey, Puckett!

1155
01:08:12,290 --> 01:08:14,880
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Little Red's gonna take a ride!

1156
01:08:15,590 --> 01:08:16,650
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And there ain't...

1157
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:18,290
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}...no...

1158
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:19,550
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}...brakes!

1159
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:23,790
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Red!

1160
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:36,410
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Aah!

1161
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:38,670
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Whoo!

1162
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:41,210
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}She doesn't trust you anymore, Granny!

1163
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:43,110
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Out of my way, bunny!

1164
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:48,040
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Whoo! Ha-ha!

1165
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:49,280
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ahh!

1166
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:51,350
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Uhh!

1167
01:08:59,270 --> 01:09:00,630
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Dolph!

1168
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:04,100
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Whahh!

1169
01:09:06,470 --> 01:09:09,000
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Wow, that's a... that's a long way.

1170
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:11,510
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- We could take the truck. - Let's take the truck.

1171
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:12,840
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yeah, cool.

1172
01:09:12,910 --> 01:09:16,780
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}They go up, you go down. Gotta help! APB! Get the bunny!

1173
01:09:16,850 --> 01:09:20,180
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- This squirrel ate the wrong nuts. - English! What's wrong with you?

1174
01:09:20,250 --> 01:09:23,020
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Wait a minute. I've got an idea.

1175
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,990
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ah... OK.

1176
01:09:36,070 --> 01:09:39,370
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The criminal cannot be found at the bottom of the mountain.

1177
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:41,740
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He resides at the top in a cave fortress

1178
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:44,140
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}where my companions are trying to detain him.

1179
01:09:44,210 --> 01:09:45,680
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Aww.

1180
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:48,370
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- That's more like it. - How do we know he's on the level?

1181
01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:51,350
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He threw himself in front of a car. That's commitment.

1182
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:54,290
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No, that's crazy. We can't get up there in time anyway.

1183
01:09:54,350 --> 01:09:58,260
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hey, chief! It looks like they're coming to us!

1184
01:10:11,770 --> 01:10:12,800
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ahh!

1185
01:10:15,540 --> 01:10:17,600
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ohh! Ohh!

1186
01:10:25,850 --> 01:10:28,910
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Granny! - I'm coming, honey!

1187
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:34,730
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Grab the hood!

1188
01:10:47,310 --> 01:10:49,170
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hold tight!

1189
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:11,160
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Whoo-hoo!

1190
01:11:11,230 --> 01:11:15,930
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}End of the line, ladies!

1191
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,940
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Granny! - You know what to do.

1192
01:11:20,110 --> 01:11:22,200
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Whoo!

1193
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:24,370
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, wonderful.

1194
01:11:30,650 --> 01:11:31,840
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No!

1195
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:33,220
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Watch your head.

1196
01:11:33,290 --> 01:11:35,250
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Oh! - Ow!

1197
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:36,310
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That hurts.

1198
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:39,320
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Get 'em outta here, boys.

1199
01:11:40,830 --> 01:11:43,960
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- No, no, no, no. Not prison. - Say Parcheesi!

1200
01:11:44,030 --> 01:11:46,500
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Not prison! Not for a cute little bunny rabbit!

1201
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:48,190
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Not prison! Not for a cute little bunny rabbit!

1202
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:50,930
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Granny, Little Bit, we got 'em!

1203
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,340
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Not bad for a little cookie maker. - Thanks.

1204
01:11:57,710 --> 01:12:01,150
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I guess I must have had my eyes shut pretty tight

1205
01:12:01,210 --> 01:12:04,740
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}not to see how fast you were growing up.

1206
01:12:05,990 --> 01:12:09,650
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You were really something up there.

1207
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:12,350
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I take after my granny.

1208
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:18,530
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hello, everybody! Here, we have the book!

1209
01:12:22,270 --> 01:12:25,600
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- What happened here tonight? - My granny swooped in and saved me.

1210
01:12:25,670 --> 01:12:28,900
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- And the whole forest! - It was my Red who saved the day.

1211
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:32,670
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, it was a group effort, spearheaded by myself, of course.

1212
01:12:32,750 --> 01:12:37,210
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You'll read the story in tomorrow's column, but I will take a few questions.

1213
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:39,950
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Mr. Kirkendal will be appearing in our ad campaign...

1214
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:42,150
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- I got a call-back! - No, don't talk.

1215
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:45,250
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}If a tree falls in the forest, you'll get three stories,

1216
01:12:45,330 --> 01:12:47,850
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}yours, mine and the tree's.

1217
01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:50,950
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, a bunny gone bad is going away,

1218
01:12:51,030 --> 01:12:54,160
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}and you'll wake up tomorrow with piping hot tea cakes,

1219
01:12:54,230 --> 01:12:56,170
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}same as always.

1220
01:12:58,340 --> 01:12:59,930
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Those are piping hot.

1221
01:13:00,010 --> 01:13:02,340
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So how about that new delivery system?

1222
01:13:02,410 --> 01:13:04,840
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, it beats riding a bike, that's for sure.

1223
01:13:04,910 --> 01:13:07,000
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}@ I got horns that hold the muffins

1224
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:09,210
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}@ And I got horns that hold the pies

1225
01:13:09,550 --> 01:13:12,020
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hey, did you hear about Kirk? He finally made it.

1226
01:13:16,190 --> 01:13:19,060
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Wanna see the show with us? - I'm allergic to yodeling.

1227
01:13:19,130 --> 01:13:21,560
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Now, Wolfie... - I'm front page material now,

1228
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:23,860
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm about to crack a story about the three pigs

1229
01:13:23,930 --> 01:13:26,420
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}running a home improvement scam. Houses falling.

1230
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:28,970
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I got the wide-angle lenses for those piggies.

1231
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:31,200
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You sure this is the right place?

1232
01:13:31,270 --> 01:13:32,930
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Ah. - Mr. Flippers.

1233
01:13:33,010 --> 01:13:34,770
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I see you all got my message.

1234
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:37,070
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Glad you could make it. - What's going on?

1235
01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:40,480
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, I was wondering if you would like to come and work for me.

1236
01:13:40,550 --> 01:13:43,070
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I could use some fresh talent like you.

1237
01:13:43,150 --> 01:13:45,010
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What kind of work are we talking about?

1238
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:48,990
{\fncambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You'd be undercover, on impossible missions...

1239
