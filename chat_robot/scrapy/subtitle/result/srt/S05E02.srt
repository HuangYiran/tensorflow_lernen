00:00:01,503 --> 00:00:03,348
《星际之门亚特兰蒂斯》  前情回顾
Previously on stargate atlantis...

2
00:00:03,479 --> 00:00:05,074
你给我每周注射的药物
The weekly injection you gave me, that must have been

3
00:00:05,112 --> 00:00:08,127
一定是要能阻止我细胞恶化的
some kind of drug to keep my cells from deteriorating.

4
00:00:08,269 --> 00:00:10,197
听着  我们会一直努力下去
Listen, we're going to keep working

5
00:00:10,238 --> 00:00:12,108
直到治愈你为止
till we find a cure for this thing.

6
00:00:14,111 --> 00:00:14,885
中头奖了
jackpot.

7
00:00:14,971 --> 00:00:17,013
这是个陷阱  我们要马上离开这
It's a booby trap. We got to get out of here now!

8
00:00:19,683 --> 00:00:21,818
把工程兵集合起来
Have the combat engineers gear up,

9
00:00:21,818 --> 00:00:23,318
叫凯勒医生准备好
and have dr. Keller ready her away team.

10
00:00:23,509 --> 00:00:24,368
你听
Listen...

11
00:00:24,454 --> 00:00:25,684
这是迈克尔的数据库
it's michael's database.

12
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,078
里面有大量甚至所有的资料
There's a large chunk of it, maybe the whole thing.

13
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:29,957
他正在仓忙出逃  我们快要抓住他了
We'd have him on the run. He'd be finished.

14
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:31,417
你被免除指挥官一职
Effective immediately,

15
00:00:31,456 --> 00:00:33,555
即刻起生效
you are being removed from command.

16
00:00:33,707 --> 00:00:35,606
谁来代替我
Who-who's replacing me?

17
00:00:36,712 --> 00:00:37,828
是我
I am.

18
00:00:40,995 --> 00:00:42,912
下午好  凯勒医生
Good afternoon, dr.Keller.

19
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:46,017
我的新病人怎么样了
How's my newest patient?

20
00:00:46,388 --> 00:00:49,823
今天  只有我一直抱着他散步
Today, he's decided that he will only sleep

21
00:00:49,937 --> 00:00:51,492
他才肯乖乖睡觉
as long as I hold him and keep moving.

22
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,524
我已经在转了大半个城市  现在要转回去
I've already walked half the city and back again.

23
00:00:53,543 --> 00:00:55,260
我父母以前把我放进车里
My parents used to put me in the car.

24
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:57,509
然后爸爸凌晨3点开车带着我
My dad would have to drive around and around and around

25
00:00:57,509 --> 00:00:58,809
在街区转来转去
the block 3:00 in the morning.

26
00:00:58,932 --> 00:01:01,652
真温馨啊  至少能坐着
That would be lovely. At least I'd be sitting down.

27
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,960
我要谢谢你
I wanted to thank you.

28
00:01:04,236 --> 00:01:04,980
为什么
For what?

29
00:01:05,276 --> 00:01:06,688
我今天见过迦楠了
I saw kanaan today.

30
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:07,861
他怎么样了
How's he doing?

31
00:01:07,966 --> 00:01:08,920
比以前好多了
Much better.

32
00:01:09,092 --> 00:01:11,448
他各方面都回到原来的样子了
He is himself once again, in every way.

33
00:01:11,619 --> 00:01:13,993
事实上  只要伍尔希先生一回到代达罗斯号
In fact, I'm going to request that

34
00:01:13,993 --> 00:01:15,693
我就去请求让迦楠还有其他人
he and many of the others be allowed to return to the city,

35
00:01:15,836 --> 00:01:18,994
重返城市生活
as soon as mr.Woolsey arrives in the daedalus.

36
00:01:19,223 --> 00:01:21,484
我仍然不敢相信山姆竟然不回来
I still can't believe sam's not coming back.

37
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,190
这比较艰难
It is difficult.

38
00:01:24,487 --> 00:01:25,880
不管怎么说
Well, anyway,

39
00:01:26,042 --> 00:01:28,956
加南还有其他混合人不是我治好的
it wasn't me that cured kanaan and the other hybrids.

40
00:01:28,956 --> 00:01:30,956
全是贝克特医生的逆转录酶的功劳
It was dr.Beckett's retrovirus,

41
00:01:31,384 --> 00:01:34,151
如果我能搞明白幽灵族的医疗资料
and you could thank him in person if I could just

42
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:37,557
你就可以亲自感谢他
get my head around all this wraith medical data.

43
00:01:37,642 --> 00:01:39,378
你认为答案就在这其中
You believe the answer's in there somewhere?

44
00:01:39,445 --> 00:01:42,511
我们知道他给卡森注射血清
We know he was giving carson a serum

45
00:01:42,511 --> 00:01:44,511
能防止他体内器官的衰老
to keep his internal organs from deteriorating,

46
00:01:44,892 --> 00:01:47,846
我想我可能找到配方了
and I think I might have found the formula

47
00:01:47,846 --> 00:01:49,846
只是要更加确认
I just need to be sure.

48
00:01:49,904 --> 00:01:52,184
至少我们知道他现在很安全
Well, at least we know he's safe for the moment.

49
00:01:52,755 --> 00:01:54,874
理论上讲  是的
Technically, yeah.

50
00:01:55,255 --> 00:01:59,338
一想到他被关在笼子里  我就揪心
I just hate the thought of him being stuck in that box.

51
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,240
你知道罗德尼去看过他吗
You know rodney goes to visit him?

52
00:02:04,116 --> 00:02:05,874
他就这么站在静止分离舱前
He stands in front of the stasis pod

53
00:02:05,874 --> 00:02:06,874
和他讲最近的事情
and tells him all the latest news.

54
00:02:06,902 --> 00:02:07,914
真的
Really?

55
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,004
一次我偶然进门撞见他
I walked in on him once by accident,

56
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:14,868
他马上假装自己在检查系统什么的
and he pretended like he was checking the system or something.

57
00:02:15,821 --> 00:02:17,748
他有时总给我惊喜
He surprises me sometimes.

58
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:24,789
我又要去成为忙碌的妈妈了
Well, this is me once again being recalled to duty.

59
00:02:24,893 --> 00:02:26,639
一路慢走
Have a nice walk.

60
00:02:27,621 --> 00:02:29,289
詹妮弗  别担心
Don't worry, jennifer.

61
00:02:29,289 --> 00:02:30,789
我相信一定会有痊愈的方法的
I'm sure you'll find what you're looking for.

62
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:47,980
长官  代达罗斯号刚脱离了超空间带
Sir, daedalus just dropped out of hyperspace.

63
00:02:48,113 --> 00:02:49,964
我们收到一个信号
We're receiving a signal.

64
00:02:50,278 --> 00:02:52,253
他来了
He's coming down.

65
00:03:06,365 --> 00:03:08,340
伍尔希长官  欢迎回来
Mr. Woolsey, welcome back.

66
00:03:08,693 --> 00:03:09,990
谢谢上校
Thank you, colonel.

67
00:03:17,681 --> 00:03:19,487
我想我还是从看你们全体人员的
I think I'll start by going over

68
00:03:19,487 --> 00:03:20,487
最新报告开始吧
copies of all your latest reports.

69
00:03:20,553 --> 00:03:21,822
你的也要  博士
Yours as well, doctor.

70
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,233
现在就看?
What, right now?

71
00:03:23,281 --> 00:03:25,304
我已经有3个星期没联系代达罗斯号了
I've been out of touch on the daedalus for three weeks.

72
00:03:25,418 --> 00:03:27,565
我要以最快的速度使一切正常运行
I'd like to be brought up to speed as quickly as possible.

73
00:03:27,613 --> 00:03:29,225
早上我们来开个重要会议
We can have a full briefing in the morning.

74
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:31,734
请把我的用品直接送到我的住处
Please have the rest of my things sent directly to my quarters.

75
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:32,964
好的  长官
Yes, sir.

76
00:03:34,032 --> 00:03:35,645
多好的发言词
Nice speech.

77
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:38,010
真振奋人心
Very inspiring.

78
00:04:29,249 --> 00:04:32,090
好吧  我们再做一次
All right, let's do one more series,

79
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,190
看看结论能不能标准化一点
see if we can get the results to normalize a little.

80
00:04:34,515 --> 00:04:36,099
医生  你还在这里
Doctor, you're still here.

81
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,009
我在桌上睡着了
Oh, yeah, I fell asleep at my desk.

82
00:04:39,427 --> 00:04:41,040
希望你要不介意
Well, if you don't mind me saying,

83
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:42,767
不过我觉得你对自己太苛刻了
I think you're pushing yourself a little hard.

84
00:04:42,948 --> 00:04:44,551
放松点吧
You should take it easy.

85
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,346
我知道  我这就去睡觉
I know, I'M... going to turn in now.

86
00:04:48,566 --> 00:04:49,797
你还好吧
Are you all right?

87
00:04:50,188 --> 00:04:51,514
我没事
Yeah, I'm fine.

88
00:04:52,086 --> 00:04:53,756
那就好  晚安
Okay, 'night.

89
00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:57,810
晚安
'Night.

90
00:06:07,595 --> 00:06:10,352
你昨晚睡了吗
did you get any sleep last night?

91
00:06:10,635 --> 00:06:12,171
我脸色不好么
Do I really look that bad?

92
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:14,499
当然不是这个意思
No, no, of course not. That's not what I meant.

93
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,351
看起来很好啊
Uh, it's really... it's a lovely...

94
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,839
谢谢
thanks.

95
00:06:20,688 --> 00:06:22,701
新桌子  不错啊
Wow, new table, huh?

96
00:06:22,939 --> 00:06:24,065
是伍尔希带过来的
Woolsey brought it with him.

97
00:06:24,066 --> 00:06:26,469
他说这样有家的感觉
He said he wanted a little piece of home.

98
00:06:26,602 --> 00:06:29,579
3.6米长红木会议桌
A 12-foot-long mahogany conference table, hmm...

99
00:06:29,807 --> 00:06:30,924
我不明白
I don't get it.

100
00:06:31,067 --> 00:06:32,592
我认为卡特上校工作很出色
I thought colonel carter was doing a good job.

101
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:33,527
我也这么认为
I agree.

102
00:06:33,575 --> 00:06:36,313
我们打败了复制人  阻止了迈克尔的阴谋
We defeated the replicators, we thwarted michael's plans,

103
00:06:36,314 --> 00:06:37,830
现在幽灵们都溃不成军了
the wraith are in a state of disarray.

104
00:06:37,952 --> 00:06:40,050
这些都是在她的领导下取得的成就
All this happened while she was leader of atlantis.

105
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,539
这就是问题所在
That's the problem.

106
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,132
我不明白
I don't understand.

107
00:06:43,133 --> 00:06:45,460
她的成功把自己害了
She's a victim of her own success.

108
00:06:45,869 --> 00:06:48,479
现在威胁等级下降
Now that the threat level is down,

109
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,479
组织就抓住这个机会
the ioa's going to jump at the chance

110
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:51,479
派个文职官员回来
to put a civilian back in command.

111
00:06:51,602 --> 00:06:53,865
还不仅仅是这样
Well, it's not just that.

112
00:06:53,865 --> 00:06:54,865
山姆不那么拘泥于规矩
I mean, sam didn't exactly stick to protocol.

113
00:06:55,104 --> 00:06:56,220
韦尔也是
Neither did weir.

114
00:06:56,343 --> 00:06:58,679
所以他们等了4年
Right, so for four years, they've been waiting

115
00:06:58,679 --> 00:07:00,179
终于找到个替他们办事的人来了
to get someone in there who'll finally do things their way.

116
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:01,857
我还是不明白
I still don't get it.

117
00:07:01,914 --> 00:07:03,709
上校  你身处未来时空
Colonel, when you were in the future,

118
00:07:03,709 --> 00:07:04,709
就可以知道现在即将发生的一切
and you learned all those things that were going to happen,

119
00:07:04,795 --> 00:07:07,228
伍尔希掌权这事不也是其中之一吗
wasn't this one of them, woolsey taking over?

120
00:07:07,323 --> 00:07:09,470
情况有点不太一样
Well, the circumstances were different.

121
00:07:09,984 --> 00:07:12,827
还真是混乱啊
Still, it is a little unsettling.

122
00:07:13,218 --> 00:07:15,614
我是说  也许要改变事态的发生
I mean, maybe it's harder to

123
00:07:15,614 --> 00:07:16,614
比我们想象的要困难
change the course of events than we thought.

124
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:18,243
这我倒不担心
Well, I wouldn't worry about it.

125
00:07:18,244 --> 00:07:20,296
现在谢帕德回来了
I mean, the fact that sheppard's here

126
00:07:20,296 --> 00:07:21,296
事情都改观了  不是吗
makes all the difference, right?

127
00:07:21,772 --> 00:07:24,396
那点时间线上伍尔希的事不是最可怕的
Woolsey wasn't the weirdest thing about that timeline.

128
00:07:24,482 --> 00:07:25,951
什么意思
What do you mean?

129
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:27,954
没什么
Never mind.

130
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:34,403
大家都到齐了
I see everyone's here.

131
00:07:36,196 --> 00:07:37,650
就开始吧
Let's get started.

132
00:07:41,308 --> 00:07:43,852
首先要祝贺你们全体人员
first of all, I'd like to congratulate all of you

133
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:46,193
在捣毁迈克尔遗留组织行动中
on the success you've had dismantling

134
00:07:46,193 --> 00:07:48,193
取得了佳绩
what's left of michael's organization.

135
00:07:48,193 --> 00:07:50,778
除了我们还没找到迈克尔尸首
Except one thing. We haven't found him yet.

136
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,901
你们在太空轨道m2s 445附近
Well, he was on the cruiser

137
00:07:53,901 --> 00:07:55,901
击落了他乘坐的飞船
you destroyed in orbit around m2s 445.

138
00:07:56,024 --> 00:07:58,600
他有可能逃离了那艘飞船
There's a chance he may have made it off the ship.

139
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,295
很对  你的这个意见在
Right, you're referring to this statement given by

140
00:08:02,295 --> 00:08:03,295
一个迈克尔旧部的报告中提及
one of michael's ex-mercenaries,

141
00:08:03,295 --> 00:08:04,295
声称有人看见他还活着
claiming to have seen him alive recently.

142
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,201
这就是他说的
That's what he said.

143
00:08:05,334 --> 00:08:07,961
这个未经证实的情报来源
This is one unsubstantiated report

144
00:08:07,961 --> 00:08:09,761
是毫无根据的
from a highly unreliable source.

145
00:08:09,952 --> 00:08:12,327
但是有人从那艘飞船上偷走了我们的战机
Well, someone stole our jumper off that ship.

146
00:08:12,756 --> 00:08:15,608
需要古人DNA才能开走那些战机吧
I thought you needed ancient dna to pilot one of those.

147
00:08:15,684 --> 00:08:17,955
没这个必要  我们发明的基因疗法
Not necessarily. We developed a gene therapy that works...

148
00:08:18,155 --> 00:08:18,985
有时就可以行的通
some of the time.

149
00:08:19,089 --> 00:08:21,858
他要为成千上万人
He is responsible for the deaths

150
00:08:21,858 --> 00:08:22,858
的死亡负责
of hundreds of thousands of people.

151
00:08:22,972 --> 00:08:24,901
如果他还活着  即使可能性很小
If there is even a chance that he is still alive,

152
00:08:24,901 --> 00:08:25,901
我们也一定要继续搜寻
we must continue the search.

153
00:08:25,902 --> 00:08:27,311
抱歉  我不能耗费
I'm sorry, but I can't devote

154
00:08:27,311 --> 00:08:30,079
全部人力在全宇宙
the resources of this base to the never-ending

155
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:32,579
毫无止境的搜寻一个人
pursuit of a single individual across an entire galaxy.

156
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,841
即使我知道他还活着
Even if I knew for a fact he were still alive,

157
00:08:34,845 --> 00:08:35,841
我也不会下令搜寻
I still wouldn't authorize it, unless you have

158
00:08:35,997 --> 00:08:40,481
除非你们有他藏身点的可靠证据
some new, credible evidence as to his whereabouts.

159
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:42,236
你们有吗
Do you?

160
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,658
没有
No.

161
00:08:44,286 --> 00:08:45,498
那么眼下
Then, for the time being,

162
00:08:45,632 --> 00:08:48,752
这件事就先搁着
I shall consider the matter closed.

163
00:08:49,069 --> 00:08:51,228
至于那些混合人
As to these prisoner hybrids.

164
00:08:51,228 --> 00:08:53,028
据我所知  他们被关在大陆的的拘留营中
I understand they're being held in a camp on the mainland?

165
00:08:53,877 --> 00:08:54,898
没错
That's right.

166
00:08:55,069 --> 00:08:57,883
他们的康复计划进展地怎么样了
And how is their rehabilitation progressing?

167
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:02,100
医生?
Doctor?

168
00:09:07,165 --> 00:09:09,999
我们取得了一定成果
well, um, we've had some success

169
00:09:10,062 --> 00:09:13,577
利用早期创造迈克尔的逆转录酶
using a slightly modified version of the original retrovirus

170
00:09:13,577 --> 00:09:15,577
来进行少许改良
that created michael in the first place.

171
00:09:15,796 --> 00:09:17,809
并筛除幽灵的DNA
It weeds out the wraith dna,

172
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:21,196
这样就可以重新恢复他们的人类形态
and allows them to resume their original human form, over time.

173
00:09:21,376 --> 00:09:23,294
会不会有长期副作用
Without any lasting ill effects?

174
00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:25,612
目前还没有
None that we've detected so far.

175
00:09:25,659 --> 00:09:27,065
很多人已经完成了治疗计划
Many have already completed the treatment.

176
00:09:27,065 --> 00:09:29,065
他们想知道什么时候可以重享自由
They're wondering when they might be released.

177
00:09:29,447 --> 00:09:31,174
别急  一件件来
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

178
00:09:31,307 --> 00:09:33,491
伍尔希长官  这些人是受害者
These people are victims, mr. Woolsey.

179
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,092
也许是  但起码现在
Maybe so, but until very recently,

180
00:09:36,092 --> 00:09:37,092
他们还是敌人
they were also enemy combatants.

181
00:09:37,093 --> 00:09:39,220
好吧  那我们就把他们终身监禁
Fine. We'll just keep them there forever.

182
00:09:39,533 --> 00:09:41,391
不  直到我认为他们可以被信任时
No. We'll keep them there

183
00:09:41,391 --> 00:09:43,826
他们就成恢复自由之身
until I'm satisfied that they can be trusted.

184
00:09:47,472 --> 00:09:51,265
至于那个被关在静止分离舱里的朋友
Now, regarding the situation with our friend in the stasis pod.

185
00:09:51,266 --> 00:09:53,529
最近你好像对他
You seem to have been giving

186
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:55,129
非常关注啊
a significant amount of attention to this lately.

187
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,019
自从我们得到迈克尔的医疗研究
Well, once we got our hands on michael's medical research,

188
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,795
我就想第一时间研究出解决方案
I thought I should make it a priority to look for a solution.

189
00:10:00,985 --> 00:10:02,578
你得出结果了?
And have you found one?

190
00:10:02,721 --> 00:10:03,427
有点
Maybe.

191
00:10:03,522 --> 00:10:05,125
我们发现一种血清
We found a serum that,

192
00:10:05,258 --> 00:10:06,467
可以在实验室里
in lab tests at least,

193
00:10:06,467 --> 00:10:09,567
稳定克隆细胞
seems to be capable of stabilizing the clone cells.

194
00:10:11,335 --> 00:10:12,470
那有什么问题呢
So, what's the problem?

195
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,960
实验一度危及其到卡森的生命
Carson was near death when we put him in that chamber.

196
00:10:14,961 --> 00:10:18,022
我要在百分百确定的情况下再进行测试
I don't want to take him out until I know for sure,

197
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:20,998
但现在实验室进展就只能到这里
but lab tests can only do so much.

198
00:10:21,112 --> 00:10:23,507
但这问题并不会就此消失  对吧
But that problem's never going to go away, is it?

199
00:10:23,687 --> 00:10:26,038
如果你的研究达到了极限
If you've reached the limit of what your research can tell you,

200
00:10:26,038 --> 00:10:27,838
你就需要做出决定
then you need to make a decision.

201
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:30,740
要么就继续  别管其副作用
Either proceed, or put the matter aside

202
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,140
要么就回到你的本职工作
and get back to your regular duty.

203
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:33,914
对吗
Right?

204
00:10:36,976 --> 00:10:38,960
你确定吗
You sure about this?

205
00:10:40,095 --> 00:10:42,786
不  但是我们不试试的话就永远得不出结论
No, but we're never going to be sure unless we give it a shot.

206
00:10:43,347 --> 00:10:47,336
他也就会永远禁锢在这里
If we don't take a chance now, he could be in there forever.

207
00:10:48,556 --> 00:10:50,283
好吧
All right, then.

208
00:10:57,194 --> 00:10:58,959
把他扶到担架上
Get him on the gurney.

209
00:11:00,337 --> 00:11:01,749
小心
Careful...

210
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:13,417
好了
okay.

211
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,172
现在怎么办
Now what?

212
00:11:17,173 --> 00:11:18,521
现在我们带他去医务室
Now we take him to the infirmary

213
00:11:18,522 --> 00:11:20,522
进一步观察有无细胞退化现象
and watch for signs for more cellular degradation.

214
00:11:20,522 --> 00:11:21,961
很快就可以知道结果了
We should know soon enough.

215
00:11:33,143 --> 00:11:34,126
嗨
Hey there.

216
00:11:34,631 --> 00:11:35,681
感觉如何
How you doing?

217
00:11:37,483 --> 00:11:38,408
还好
Fine.

218
00:11:39,124 --> 00:11:40,336
出了什么事
What happened?

219
00:11:40,803 --> 00:11:42,415
你以为呢
Well, what do you think?

220
00:11:42,682 --> 00:11:43,789
我们把你解冻了
We thawed you out.

221
00:11:44,256 --> 00:11:45,591
还能见到你真好  卡森
It's nice to see you again, carson.

222
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:47,843
是啊感觉怎样  医生  好久不见了
Yeah, what's up, doc? It's been a while.

223
00:11:48,005 --> 00:11:48,959
没错
Aye.

224
00:11:49,722 --> 00:11:51,086
我在那呆了多久
How long was I in there?

225
00:11:51,134 --> 00:11:53,710
差不多2个月
Two months, give or take.

226
00:11:54,186 --> 00:11:55,350
这期间有什么大事发生吗
Did I miss anything?

227
00:11:55,494 --> 00:11:57,068
没什么  像平常一样
You know, just the usual.

228
00:11:58,403 --> 00:11:59,929
我有个好消息
Well, I've got good news.

229
00:11:59,977 --> 00:12:03,536
目前  你还没有出现细胞退化现象
At the moment, you're showing no signs of cellular degradation.

230
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:06,178
那你的工作就轻松多了
You were able to recreate the treatment.

231
00:12:06,787 --> 00:12:07,970
没错
That's right.

232
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,138
我会让他们把一切都告诉你
I'll let them tell you all about it.

233
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:15,335
医生...干的不错
Hey, doc... um, nice work.

234
00:12:15,612 --> 00:12:17,424
但这不是长久之计
Well, it's not a permanent solution.

235
00:12:17,539 --> 00:12:18,884
当前来说已经足够了
It's good enough for now.

236
00:12:20,255 --> 00:12:21,609
休息下吧
Go get some rest.

237
00:12:21,781 --> 00:12:24,510
对  我觉得这是个好主意
Yeah, I think that might be a good idea.

238
00:13:06,627 --> 00:13:07,553
你在这
There you are.

239
00:13:09,756 --> 00:13:11,197
太美了  是不是
Gorgeous, isn't it?

240
00:13:12,245 --> 00:13:13,562
是吧
I suppose so.

241
00:13:13,991 --> 00:13:15,966
你知道吗  我以前真的很留恋这地方
You know, I really did miss this place.

242
00:13:16,814 --> 00:13:18,637
是啊  不过别总想这些了
Yeah, well, don't get used to it.

243
00:13:21,536 --> 00:13:22,519
这什么意思
What's that supposed to mean?

244
00:13:22,595 --> 00:13:24,933
听着  我刚得知他们要送你回地球
Look, I just found out they're sending you back to earth.

245
00:13:25,114 --> 00:13:26,803
下午会有一次预定拨号
There's a scheduled dial-out this afternoon.

246
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:31,333
我想这也是应该的吧
Oh, well, I suppose it's to be expected.

247
00:13:31,581 --> 00:13:33,489
我是说  即使接受这些治疗
I mean, even with these injections,

248
00:13:33,937 --> 00:13:35,639
想要完全恢复
I imagine it'd still be months

249
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,640
也要数月之久
before I'm in any sort of decent physical condition.

250
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,496
罗德尼  我是泰勒  麻烦过来一下
Rodney, this is teyla, come in, please.

251
00:13:39,497 --> 00:13:40,517
什么事
Go ahead.

252
00:13:40,716 --> 00:13:43,245
很抱歉打扰你  但我需要你的帮助
I'm sorry to bother you, but I need your help.

253
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,345
怎么了
What is it?

254
00:13:46,421 --> 00:13:49,180
是凯勒医生  本来我们说好一起吃早饭的
It's dr.Keller. She was supposed join me for breakfast this morning

255
00:13:49,181 --> 00:13:50,181
但现在还没过来
but did not show up.

256
00:13:50,475 --> 00:13:51,849
也许她还在睡觉
So maybe she's sleeping in.

257
00:13:51,906 --> 00:13:53,674
我开始也这么想  决定不打扰她
I assumed as much as well, and decided not to disturb her.

258
00:13:53,675 --> 00:13:55,675
可是已经过了4个小时了
However, that was four hours ago.

259
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,469
她现在值班都晚了
She's now late for her shift,

260
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,470
而且呼叫她也没有回应
and she's not responding to radio calls.

261
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,537
你想要我怎么做
What do you want me to do about it?

262
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:00,587
破坏门控
Override the door controlS.

263
00:14:00,624 --> 00:14:02,266
我不会破门而入的
I'm not breaking into her room.

264
00:14:02,267 --> 00:14:04,813
罗德尼  也许有异常情况
Rodney, there might be something wrong.

265
00:14:05,881 --> 00:14:08,027
好吧  但如果她只是在那睡觉
Fine, but if she's just in there sleeping,

266
00:14:08,065 --> 00:14:10,889
裸体或是什么  你们得承担责任
or naked or something, you guys are taking the blame.

267
00:14:17,379 --> 00:14:19,402
天啊  罗德尼  快点吧
oh, for god's sake, rodney, hurry up.

268
00:14:25,602 --> 00:14:27,310
珍妮弗  你没事吧
Jennifer, are you all right?

269
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:28,979
珍妮弗
Jennifer?

270
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,859
她肯定昏迷了
She must be unconscious.

271
00:14:35,272 --> 00:14:36,360
瞳孔放大
Pupils dilated.

272
00:14:36,484 --> 00:14:37,905
卡森  退后
Carson, step away from the bed.

273
00:14:37,971 --> 00:14:38,734
怎么了
What?

274
00:14:38,735 --> 00:14:40,232
快点退后
Step away now!

275
00:14:40,452 --> 00:14:41,826
怎么回事
What is it?

276
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:46,948
天啊
Dear lord.

277
00:14:48,007 --> 00:14:49,972
谢帕德上校  我是泰勒
Colonel sheppard, this is teyla.

278
00:14:50,086 --> 00:14:51,355
请说
Go ahead.

279
00:14:51,479 --> 00:14:53,073
约翰  我们有麻烦
John, we have a problem.

280
00:15:00,742 --> 00:15:01,820
到底怎么了
What the hell's going on?

281
00:15:01,821 --> 00:15:03,220
我们不能确定  发现她的时候就这样了
We're not sure. This is how we found her.

282
00:15:03,257 --> 00:15:04,546
肯定昨晚发生的
It must've happened last night.

283
00:15:04,593 --> 00:15:06,540
我以前见过这种东西
I've seen something like this before.

284
00:15:06,654 --> 00:15:07,465
在哪
Where?

285
00:15:07,466 --> 00:15:08,505
迈克尔的一个实验室里
One of michael's labs.

286
00:15:08,524 --> 00:15:10,556
他当时在进行一些实验
He was conducting some kind of experiment.

287
00:15:11,737 --> 00:15:12,930
我们得把这东西弄开
Well, we've got to get it off of her.

288
00:15:12,931 --> 00:15:15,086
我不觉得这是个好主意
I'm not so certain that's such a good idea.

289
00:15:15,142 --> 00:15:16,062
依我看
From what I can tell,

290
00:15:16,063 --> 00:15:18,063
她和床架还有这些须蔓已经连为一体了
the tendrils are attached to her and the bedframe.

291
00:15:18,186 --> 00:15:19,846
如果我们硬扯下来
If we just start ripping them off,

292
00:15:20,104 --> 00:15:21,745
会让她受重伤的
we could cause her serious injury.

293
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,681
但我们不能就这样让她躺在这
Well, we can't just leave her like this.

294
00:15:23,947 --> 00:15:25,848
我们得把她弄到隔离室
We need to get her into an isolation chamber,

295
00:15:25,849 --> 00:15:26,849
连床一起
and take the whole bed as well.

296
00:15:27,048 --> 00:15:28,826
那样我们才能进行全面检查
That way we can run a full examination

297
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:30,827
看看到底出了什么状况
and see what we're dealing with here.

298
00:15:33,635 --> 00:15:36,077
那些东西是从她体内长出来的?
These things are actually growing out of her body?

299
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:37,604
看起来像是
That's what it looks like.

300
00:15:37,605 --> 00:15:38,786
她还有意识吗
Is she conscious?

301
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:40,336
贝克特说她的脑活跃度
Beckett says her brain activity

302
00:15:40,337 --> 00:15:42,337
与普通的昏迷病人类似
is consistent with somebody in a coma.

303
00:15:42,392 --> 00:15:44,815
贝克特医生还没有复职啊
Dr. Beckett is not on active duty.

304
00:15:44,816 --> 00:15:46,031
他当时在现场
He was the first one there.

305
00:15:46,032 --> 00:15:48,032
说他以前见过类似的东西
He says he's seen something like this before.

306
00:15:48,346 --> 00:15:49,902
当他被监禁的时候
While he was a prisoner.

307
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:52,376
他被迫为迈克尔工作了2年
He was forced to work for michael for two years.

308
00:15:52,377 --> 00:15:54,377
没有人比他更了解这东西了
Nobody knows this stuff better than he does.

309
00:15:58,224 --> 00:16:00,962
我先试着切断较细的须蔓
I'm going to try to cut some of the thinner strands.

310
00:16:01,113 --> 00:16:02,497
手术刀
Scalpel.

311
00:16:03,575 --> 00:16:05,426
谢谢
Thank you.

312
00:16:15,681 --> 00:16:16,692
好了
There we go.

313
00:16:16,711 --> 00:16:17,637
护士?
Nurse?

314
00:16:17,998 --> 00:16:19,153
一切正常
No change.

315
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,966
马上拿去化验
Get that analyzed right away.

316
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,925
医生  血压在下降  脉搏也是
Doctor, blood pressure's dropping. Pulse as well.

317
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,651
我就担心这种情况  她的生命力在下降
That's what I was afraid of. She's crashing.

318
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,998
注入5毫克阿托品
Administer five milligrams of atropine.

319
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:30,715
天啊...
My god...

320
00:16:31,087 --> 00:16:32,241
加油...
come on...

321
00:16:39,616 --> 00:16:41,200
好了
there she is.

322
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:47,158
抱歉  我不敢再切了
I'm sorry, I don't dare make another incision.

323
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:51,212
看来不能动其它的了
So much for cutting her loose.

324
00:16:53,352 --> 00:16:55,737
贝克特医生  我想和你谈谈
Dr. Beckett, I'd like a word.

325
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:01,884
别担心  我会救她出来  只要我回到实验室
Don't worry, I'll get her out. Once I get back to the lab--

326
00:17:01,885 --> 00:17:03,967
医生  我很感激你的努力
doctor, I appreciate what you're trying to do,

327
00:17:03,968 --> 00:17:05,968
但到地球的拨号1小时后就开始了
but our earth dial-out is in one hour.

328
00:17:06,873 --> 00:17:09,153
如果你不介意  我想等下一次再走
I'll take a pass on this one, if you don't mind.

329
00:17:09,601 --> 00:17:11,261
如果不是凯勒医生
If it wasn't for dr. Keller,

330
00:17:11,414 --> 00:17:14,238
我可能还被关在静室里  甚至永远关在那
I'd still be locked in that stasis chamber, possibly forever.

331
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,128
凯勒医生的报告十分清楚
Dr. Keller's own report is abundantly clear.

332
00:17:17,232 --> 00:17:19,287
即使你的病情稳定了
While your condition has stabilized,

333
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,288
你的内脏依然受损严重
you've still suffered severe damage to your internal organs.

334
00:17:21,305 --> 00:17:22,177
你需要在医院静养
You need to be in a hospital bed yourself,

335
00:17:22,178 --> 00:17:24,178
而不是去操刀手术
not running a medical investigation.

336
00:17:24,206 --> 00:17:25,589
我没事
I'll be fine.

337
00:17:26,142 --> 00:17:28,718
一发现身体不适  我会立刻退让  我保证
At the first sign of trouble, I'll step aside, I promise.

338
00:17:28,906 --> 00:17:30,786
你确信这与迈克尔有关?
You're convinced this has something to do with michael?

339
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,828
这可不是什么麻疹  对不对
Well, it's not a case of the hives, is it?

340
00:17:39,303 --> 00:17:40,429
她怎么样了
How's she doing?

341
00:17:40,486 --> 00:17:43,291
基本稳定了  依然还有微弱脑电波
Vitals have stabilized, still showing minimal brain function.

342
00:17:43,377 --> 00:17:45,485
我们已取得血液和组织样本
We did manage to get blood and tissue samples.

343
00:17:45,561 --> 00:17:47,918
好吧  那我们有活要做了
All right, then we've got some work to do.

344
00:17:51,324 --> 00:17:53,461
你不是要把他送回去吗
You're not sending him back, huh?

345
00:17:53,547 --> 00:17:55,827
他是这方面唯一的专家了
He is the closest thing to an expert we have.

346
00:17:56,161 --> 00:17:58,355
这可不是照章办事
It's not exactly by the book.

347
00:17:58,356 --> 00:18:00,119
别老是这样
Don't get used to it.

348
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,224
进展如何
How's it coming?

349
00:18:09,348 --> 00:18:10,627
缓慢
Slowly,

350
00:18:11,246 --> 00:18:12,954
但我在珍妮弗的血样里发现了些东西
but I did find something in jennifer's blood sample.

351
00:18:12,955 --> 00:18:13,784
什么
What?

352
00:18:13,956 --> 00:18:15,005
别急
Easy.

353
00:18:15,072 --> 00:18:18,325
是某种外星病菌  从未见过
It's some kind of alien pathogen, so far unidentified.

354
00:18:18,382 --> 00:18:19,756
我正在对照数据库
I'm checking it against the database.

355
00:18:19,757 --> 00:18:22,045
她会不会变成混种人
Is it possible she's turning into a hybrid?

356
00:18:22,245 --> 00:18:23,438
不  我想不会
No, I don't think so.

357
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,843
我见过很多变种的实例
I've seen several variations of the conversion process,

358
00:18:25,844 --> 00:18:26,844
从来没有这样的
but never anything like this.

359
00:18:26,928 --> 00:18:28,188
这肯定与迈克尔有关
Well, it's got to be something to do with michael.

360
00:18:28,235 --> 00:18:30,212
我是说  她把我们救出实验室后
I mean, she hasn't been offworld

361
00:18:30,213 --> 00:18:31,213
就再没出去过
since she helped rescue us from that lab.

362
00:18:31,213 --> 00:18:32,395
我也这么想
That's what I was thinking.

363
00:18:32,537 --> 00:18:33,381
当然  如果她是
Of course, if that's

364
00:18:33,382 --> 00:18:35,382
在那里感染上病菌的话...
where she came in contact with the pathogen...

365
00:18:35,609 --> 00:18:37,383
你认为我们也有可能被感染了
you think the rest of us may have been exposed as well.

366
00:18:37,384 --> 00:18:38,729
是啊  这很有可能
Well, aye, it's a possibility.

367
00:18:38,834 --> 00:18:41,478
我需要当时在场的所有人的血样
I'll need blood samples from everyone who was on that planet,

368
00:18:41,479 --> 00:18:42,479
包括你
including you.

369
00:18:42,545 --> 00:18:43,928
很好
Oh, great.

370
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:45,310
医生...
Doctor...

371
00:18:45,311 --> 00:18:46,131
什么事
Yes?

372
00:18:46,598 --> 00:18:47,324
说
Yes.

373
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,458
她醒了
She's awake.

374
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,615
谢谢  好的
Thank you. Right.

375
00:18:57,736 --> 00:18:59,797
天啊...
Oh, my god...

376
00:19:08,264 --> 00:19:10,382
罗德尼  我这是怎么了
rodney, what's happening to me?

377
00:19:10,898 --> 00:19:12,730
我们还不十分肯定
We're not entirely sure.

378
00:19:13,063 --> 00:19:15,496
这像是某种茧
It looks like some kind of a cocoon.

379
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,879
疼吗
Does it hurt?

380
00:19:17,184 --> 00:19:19,808
我什么也感觉不到  完全动不了
I can't feel anything. I can't move.

381
00:19:20,008 --> 00:19:21,268
好吧  听着...
Okay, look...

382
00:19:23,175 --> 00:19:25,474
你不要担心  好吗  我们会把你救出来
don't you worry, okay? We're going to get you out.

383
00:19:25,808 --> 00:19:27,563
还有谁在这
Who else is here?

384
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:30,587
什么意思  没别人了
What do you mean? There's no one.

385
00:19:31,264 --> 00:19:34,174
我不想睡觉  我怕再也不会醒来
I don't want to go to sleep. I'm afraid I won't wake up.

386
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:35,385
珍妮弗
Jennifer?

387
00:19:35,386 --> 00:19:37,064
不是我的错
It's not my fault.

388
00:19:37,255 --> 00:19:40,003
当然不是  这是某种外星生物
Of course it's not. It's an alien organism.

389
00:19:41,118 --> 00:19:41,843
什么
What?

390
00:19:41,844 --> 00:19:43,264
卡森在你血样里发现的
Carson found it in your blood sample.

391
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,668
他正在研究这东西的  然后
He's going to figure out what it is, and then

392
00:19:45,744 --> 00:19:48,272
我们就知道如何消灭它了
we're going to figure out how to kill it.

393
00:19:48,635 --> 00:19:49,885
我的手
My hand.

394
00:19:51,105 --> 00:19:51,840
怎么了
What about it?

395
00:19:51,841 --> 00:19:53,614
是从手开始的
That's where it started.

396
00:19:53,615 --> 00:19:55,455
我几天前看到的
I saw it a few nights ago.

397
00:19:55,531 --> 00:19:57,182
那你当时为什么不说
So why didn't you say anything?

398
00:19:57,353 --> 00:19:59,634
我当时在扫描  我...
I was going to run a scan. I don'T...

399
00:20:00,806 --> 00:20:02,037
我不知道
I don't know.

400
00:20:02,475 --> 00:20:04,603
没关系  知道吗  我们会搞定的
It doesn't matter, okay? We're going to fix this.

401
00:20:04,889 --> 00:20:06,654
我保证
I promise.

402
00:20:15,885 --> 00:20:17,774
这东西似乎能影响她的意识
It appears to be affecting her mind.

403
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,902
是啊  她说能听到些声音
Aye, she claims to be hearing voices,

404
00:20:19,977 --> 00:20:21,370
好像房间里还有其他人
like there's someone else in the room with her.

405
00:20:21,371 --> 00:20:22,992
它生长的有多快
How fast is it growing?

406
00:20:22,993 --> 00:20:25,758
目前来看  每过几小时就会增殖一倍
Currently, it's doubling its mass every couple of hours.

407
00:20:26,588 --> 00:20:27,838
谢谢
Thank you.

408
00:20:28,629 --> 00:20:30,556
这已经不仅仅关系到凯勒医生了
This isn't just about dr. Keller anymore.

409
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:32,905
我得知道这东西
I need to know if this thing

410
00:20:32,906 --> 00:20:33,906
是否会威胁到基地的安全
is going to be a threat to the base.

411
00:20:34,477 --> 00:20:36,481
答案是肯定的
I'd say that's a definite yes.

412
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:37,978
你什么意思
What do you mean?

413
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,506
谢帕德上校  若楠  罗德尼
Colonel sheppard, ronon, rodney,

414
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:43,292
所有到过m2s 445的人
everyone who was on m2s 445,

415
00:20:43,588 --> 00:20:45,353
检验结果全部为阳性
they all tested positive.

416
00:20:46,049 --> 00:20:47,852
不管这到底是什么
Whatever this is,

417
00:20:48,471 --> 00:20:50,275
他们都感染了
they've all got it.

418
00:20:56,844 --> 00:20:58,381
现在我们假定
Right now we're working under the assumption

419
00:20:58,409 --> 00:21:01,634
这个外星病毒源于那个实验室
that this alien pathogen was present somewhere in that lab,

420
00:21:01,805 --> 00:21:03,999
很可能是迈克尔实验的一部分
possibly as part of one of michael's experiments.

421
00:21:04,209 --> 00:21:06,938
那所建筑被毁的时候  它随之释放出来
When the building was destroyed, it was released.

422
00:21:07,118 --> 00:21:09,007
我们已经回来一个多月
We've been back for a month now.

423
00:21:09,008 --> 00:21:11,337
如果它要大面积传播的话
It was going to spread to the general population,

424
00:21:11,338 --> 00:21:12,338
现在早就大爆发了
it would've already happened.

425
00:21:12,441 --> 00:21:13,157
我知道
I know.

426
00:21:13,185 --> 00:21:16,133
贝克特医生确认它是无传染性的
Dr. Beckett is now fairly confident that it's not contagious.

427
00:21:16,352 --> 00:21:18,584
那为什么要我们只能呆在房间里
Right, then, why confine us to our quarters?

428
00:21:18,585 --> 00:21:20,311
你也看过凯勒医生的症状
You've seen what's happening to dr. Keller.

429
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,611
-没错 但我可没那样啊  -还没有而已
- Yeah, but it's not happening to me.  -Not yet.

430
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:25,948
症状先从凯勒医生开始
There could be any number of random physiological

431
00:21:26,048 --> 00:21:27,000
可能有很多随机的生理因素
reasons why it's starting with dr. Keller,

432
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,748
但现在不能保证
but that's no guarantee that

433
00:21:28,749 --> 00:21:29,749
你们不会发生这种情况
it's not going to happen to the rest of you.

434
00:21:29,972 --> 00:21:32,608
可能再过几天  甚至几小时
It could be a matter of days, it could be a matter of hours.

435
00:21:32,784 --> 00:21:36,124
就连卡特上校返回星门指挥部也要被隔离
Even colonel carter's been quarantined back at stargate command.

436
00:21:36,698 --> 00:21:38,331
听着  我知道对你来说
Look, I know it's hard for you

437
00:21:38,332 --> 00:21:40,332
当一个旁观者很难受  上校
to stay on the sidelines, colonel,

438
00:21:41,257 --> 00:21:42,780
但这才是正确的做法
but it's the right call.

439
00:21:44,491 --> 00:21:47,819
那这个时候凯勒怎么办
In the meantime, what are we going to do about keller?

440
00:21:50,179 --> 00:21:52,054
我们还在研究当前形势
We're still assessing the situation.

441
00:21:59,935 --> 00:22:01,427
我们还不知道病毒
We still don't know how the pathogen

442
00:22:01,428 --> 00:22:03,428
如何引起了生理变化
causes the physiological changes,

443
00:22:03,509 --> 00:22:05,259
但已经完成了
but we've managed to

444
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,260
对萃取样品的分析
complete our analysis of the sample I extracted.

445
00:22:08,232 --> 00:22:10,529
本质上这是一种二元共聚物
Essentially it's a biopolymer,

446
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:12,091
类似于多糖类
similar to a polysaccharide,

447
00:22:12,092 --> 00:22:14,092
但是混合了有机金属
but with organo-metallic compounds mixed in.

448
00:22:14,162 --> 00:22:16,189
请通俗点  医生
For the uninitiated, please, doctor.

449
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:18,701
就像是昆虫或者甲壳类生物
It's like the material

450
00:22:18,702 --> 00:22:20,702
构成其外壳的物质
an insect or a crustacean uses to form its shell.

451
00:22:20,888 --> 00:22:22,709
刚开始很柔软
At first, it's soft and pliable,

452
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,710
随后变得极为坚硬
and then it becomes tough and leathery,

453
00:22:24,861 --> 00:22:27,357
最后会到达一种不可思议的密度
and eventually it hardens into an incredible density,

454
00:22:27,358 --> 00:22:29,256
能抵御热能  压力甚至辐射
resistant to heat, pressure, and even radiation.

455
00:22:29,257 --> 00:22:31,257
是的  就像飞船的外壳
Yes, it's like the hull of a ship.

456
00:22:31,502 --> 00:22:32,439
是的
Aye.

457
00:22:32,568 --> 00:22:33,658
你在说什么
What are you saying?

458
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:36,588
听着  我们知道幽灵战舰本身是生物体
Look, we always knew that the wraith ships were organic in design,

459
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:39,589
本质上说  它不是被建造的而是自己长成的
right, that they were essentially grown instead of constructed.

460
00:22:39,728 --> 00:22:41,170
我们只是从没看到过而已
We've just never witnessed it before.

461
00:22:41,171 --> 00:22:43,072
你是在告诉我说
Are you telling me that

462
00:22:43,073 --> 00:22:45,073
隔离室内部会长出一艘蜂巢式战舰?
a hive ship is growing inside that isolation room?

463
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:48,494
事实上它已经不算是在隔离室内部了
Actually, it's no longer just inside the isolation room.

464
00:22:48,552 --> 00:22:50,779
生命探测器发现不了它
It doesn't register on our life-signs detector,

465
00:22:50,814 --> 00:22:52,537
但一旦我们知道要找的是什么
but once we knew what we were looking for,

466
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:55,818
就可以校准内部传感器来提取信号
we calibrated our internal sensors to pick it up.

467
00:22:57,154 --> 00:23:00,013
它已经穿过了墙面和地板
It has penetrated the walls and the floors,

468
00:23:00,014 --> 00:23:03,166
消耗和转化它所经过的物质
consuming and converting the material as it goes.

469
00:23:03,167 --> 00:23:04,900
传播的有多快
How far has it spread?

470
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:08,920
已经向下延伸了3层
It's gone down... three levels already,

471
00:23:09,142 --> 00:23:12,388
而且它黏附到电力系统去了
and it has attached itself to the electrical system.

472
00:23:12,494 --> 00:23:14,111
它正在吸取电能
It's siphoning off power as it goes.

473
00:23:14,112 --> 00:23:17,088
好像这还能显著加快它的生长速度
This seems to have accelerated its growth significantly.

474
00:23:18,283 --> 00:23:19,595
怎样才能阻止它
How do we stop it?

475
00:23:19,596 --> 00:23:21,494
这是我们正在研究的
That's the part we're still trying to figure out.

476
00:23:21,495 --> 00:23:23,150
我们可以切断电源
We could cut off the power.

477
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:25,151
这能大大降低它的增长速度
That should slow it down quite a bit.

478
00:23:29,709 --> 00:23:31,197
怎么回事
What's happening?

479
00:23:31,314 --> 00:23:32,814
玛丽  怎么回事
Marie, what's going on?

480
00:23:32,815 --> 00:23:35,884
医生  我们被要求立即撤离这里
Doctor, we've been ordered to evacuate the building.

481
00:23:36,271 --> 00:23:37,724
对不起
I'm sorry.

482
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,633
他们就这样抛弃她了?
They just left her there?

483
00:23:50,715 --> 00:23:52,614
他们别无选择啊
I don't think they had much of a choice.

484
00:23:52,615 --> 00:23:53,672
卡森正在搜索迈克尔的数据库
Carson is searching michael's database

485
00:23:53,673 --> 00:23:55,673
看看有没有可以帮助我们的东西
to see if there is anything that can help us.

486
00:23:55,673 --> 00:23:57,758
关掉电源是泽兰卡的主意吧
I suppose it was zelenka's idea to shut off the power?

487
00:23:57,899 --> 00:23:59,094
不清楚  怎么了
I don't know. Why?

488
00:23:59,141 --> 00:24:00,571
这太荒唐了
This is ridiculous.

489
00:24:00,688 --> 00:24:02,192
新来的家伙采纳了二队的建议
They got us stuck in our quarters

490
00:24:02,193 --> 00:24:04,193
而把我们隔离了?
while the new guy takes advice from the b team?

491
00:24:04,332 --> 00:24:05,692
什么意思  罗德尼
What is it, rodney?

492
00:24:05,809 --> 00:24:08,118
他们认为这东西穿透了墙壁地面
They are assuming that it tapped into the electric grid

493
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:11,119
然后接入了电力网
by randomly spreading out through the walls and floors.

494
00:24:11,211 --> 00:24:13,579
如果它实际上是向电磁场生长呢
What if it actually grows towards electromagnetic fields,

495
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,325
就像植物向阳生长
like a plant growing toward the sun?

496
00:24:15,372 --> 00:24:19,063
它会直接向下一个合适的能源延伸
It's going to head directly for the next available power source.

497
00:24:20,399 --> 00:24:21,418
这里
There.

498
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:24,594
城市下面的某个主电力通道
One of the city's main power conduits runs beneath the building.

499
00:24:24,864 --> 00:24:26,832
这么说那个区域的电源也得关掉
So shut the power down in that section as well.

500
00:24:26,856 --> 00:24:28,274
不  我们已经做了
No, we already did, right,

501
00:24:28,275 --> 00:24:30,711
不过这条线缆直接跟零点通道相连
but this runs directly into the zpm.

502
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:33,184
就好比是快行道
It's like an express lane.

503
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:35,469
我们已经关闭了剩下的通道  但是
We've already shut off the rest of the traffic, but

504
00:24:35,528 --> 00:24:36,852
这一条还会独立运作
this one keeps moving along.

505
00:24:36,853 --> 00:24:38,813
唯一能阻止它的办法就是拔出零点通道
The only way to stop it would be to pull the zpm

506
00:24:38,814 --> 00:24:40,814
然后关掉整个城市的电力
and shut off power to the entire city.

507
00:24:41,516 --> 00:24:43,208
想不到你对配电网
I had no idea you were so familiar

508
00:24:43,209 --> 00:24:45,209
会这么熟悉
with the power distribution grid.

509
00:24:45,618 --> 00:24:48,407
没有啦  我只是和罗德尼谈过
I'm not. I spoke to rodney.

510
00:24:51,641 --> 00:24:52,790
这有问题吗
Is there a problem?

511
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:55,907
病原体似乎对寄主有心理上的影响
The pathogen seems to have a psychological effect on the host.

512
00:24:55,989 --> 00:24:58,508
至少我们知道在出现生理症状前
At the very least, we know it can affect their judgment,

513
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:01,168
大脑的思维能力就会被影响
possibly well before any physical symptoms appear.

514
00:25:01,169 --> 00:25:03,149
是的  但他这一点说得没错
Yes, but he's not wrong about this.

515
00:25:03,512 --> 00:25:04,723
如果它到达输电管
If it reaches the conduit,

516
00:25:04,724 --> 00:25:06,724
就可以无限制的获取电能了
it will have access to virtually unlimited power.

517
00:25:06,911 --> 00:25:08,375
然后会怎样
And what would happen?

518
00:25:08,376 --> 00:25:10,590
生长速度会呈指数级别增长
The growth would increase exponentially.

519
00:25:10,591 --> 00:25:12,118
而我们因为关掉这部分的电源
And since we've shut this section down,

520
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:14,119
就没有任何传感器了
we have no sensors in the area,

521
00:25:14,153 --> 00:25:15,528
所以只能用肉眼
so the only way to know how far it's penetrated is

522
00:25:15,529 --> 00:25:17,529
观察它的延伸范围了
to do a visual inspection.

523
00:25:18,219 --> 00:25:20,727
好吧  全体集合
All right, assemble a team.

524
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:28,059
我需要答案  医生
I need some answers, doctor.

525
00:25:28,176 --> 00:25:29,805
怎么把这东西弄死
How do we kill this thing?

526
00:25:30,121 --> 00:25:32,171
我们在研究一种遗传病毒
Well, we're working on a genetically engineered virus

527
00:25:32,291 --> 00:25:34,192
也许可以消灭
that might be capable of destroying the pathogen

528
00:25:34,193 --> 00:25:36,193
感染凯勒医生的病原体
that's infecting dr. Keller

529
00:25:36,509 --> 00:25:39,872
但不会根除这种高分子聚合物
but that wouldn't eliminate the biopolymer itself.

530
00:25:39,989 --> 00:25:41,735
怎么才行
What would?

531
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:46,915
伍尔希先生  现在我也不知道
At this time, mr. Woolsey, I have no idea.

532
00:25:52,032 --> 00:25:54,551
主电力通道从这堵墙后穿过
So the main conduit runs behind this wall here.

533
00:25:55,653 --> 00:25:57,668
这里  我们可以通过这个面板进去
Here, we can access it through this panel.

534
00:26:04,316 --> 00:26:06,222
警官  带上你的人  分头行动
Sergeant, take your men, split up,

535
00:26:06,223 --> 00:26:07,223
搜索周围走廊
and search the surrounding corridors.

536
00:26:07,223 --> 00:26:09,730
检查下有没有什么异常
Look for anything that seems unusual.

537
00:26:12,474 --> 00:26:13,575
好了吗
All right?

538
00:26:13,657 --> 00:26:15,099
好了
Okay.

539
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:28,413
我去那边
Right, I'll go this way.

540
00:26:28,496 --> 00:26:30,160
保持通信联络
Stay in radio contact.

541
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:58,589
我想我找到了些东西
I think I have something.

542
00:27:06,147 --> 00:27:07,800
看起来罗德尼是对的
Looks like rodney was right.

543
00:27:10,048 --> 00:27:11,723
天啊
Oh my.

544
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,833
怎么了
What is it?

545
00:27:14,278 --> 00:27:16,997
看来它已经黏附上电力管了
Looks like it's attached itself to the power conduit.

546
00:27:17,712 --> 00:27:19,575
我过来找你
I'm coming to you.

547
00:27:23,596 --> 00:27:27,158
我看看能否测定
I'm going to see if I can determine

548
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:28,159
它吸取了多少能量
how much power it's draining.

549
00:27:57,113 --> 00:27:58,719
快走  快走
Let's go, let's go.

550
00:27:58,813 --> 00:28:00,149
快点
Come on.

551
00:28:06,741 --> 00:28:07,749
你还好吗
Are you all right?

552
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:08,991
还行
I think so.

553
00:28:11,418 --> 00:28:14,252
这比我们预料到的要糟多了
This is much worse than we thought.

554
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,417
-我不知道它还可以动  -我也是
-I had no idea it could move like that.  -Nor did I.

555
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:24,322
看起来只是轻微的脑震荡  没什么事的
looks like it's just a minor concussion. He should be fine.

556
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,858
看来让这东西
So it wasn't bad enough

557
00:28:25,859 --> 00:28:26,859
逐渐占领基地还不是最糟的
that this thing was slowly taking over the base.

558
00:28:26,859 --> 00:28:28,358
现在它开始攻击人了?
Now it's attacking people?

559
00:28:28,639 --> 00:28:30,139
我们需要想出一个解决办法
We need to put a stop to this, now.

560
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,475
有难度啊
It won't be easy.

561
00:28:31,545 --> 00:28:33,901
它已经吸收了大量能量
It's already siphoned off a massive amount of power.

562
00:28:33,902 --> 00:28:35,764
我们应该拔出零点通道
We should pull the zpm.

563
00:28:35,765 --> 00:28:37,100
这样还不行
That might not be enough.

564
00:28:37,217 --> 00:28:39,030
我们在黑暗中呆坐数周
We could sit here in the dark for weeks

565
00:28:39,031 --> 00:28:40,031
而这东西则会不断生长
while it just keeps on growing.

566
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,471
我们得把珍妮弗弄出这儿
We need to get jennifer out of there.

567
00:28:41,472 --> 00:28:43,311
我和各位一样想救凯勒的命
I want to save dr. Keller as much as anyone else,

568
00:28:43,312 --> 00:28:45,010
但是我们有其他东西需要考虑
but we have additional concerns now.

569
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,651
为什么它会攻击拉迪克
Why did it attack radek?

570
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:49,381
因为它认为他会对自己造成威胁
Because it perceived him as a threat and took action.

571
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,967
这说明它有智慧
That indicates intelligence,

572
00:28:50,968 --> 00:28:52,968
但就我们所知  但它并没有自己的大脑
but as far as we know, it has no brain of its own.

573
00:28:53,084 --> 00:28:54,877
你的意思是它在利用她
So you're saying it's using her.

574
00:28:54,968 --> 00:28:56,093
它是需要她
I'm saying it needs her,

575
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:59,245
来计划  调整  识别威胁  并作出反应
to plan, to coordinate, to identify threats and deal with them.

576
00:28:59,269 --> 00:29:01,718
难怪她说会听到一些声音
That could explain why she was hearing voices.

577
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:03,933
这种生物体会部分占据她的大脑
The organism takes over a portion of the brain,

578
00:29:03,934 --> 00:29:06,558
建立一个独立的意识
and sets up a separate consciousness.

579
00:29:06,804 --> 00:29:08,175
就像是多种人格一样
Like multiple personalities.

580
00:29:08,176 --> 00:29:10,694
这就是要找个人作为寄主的原因
Otherwise, why have a human host at all?

581
00:29:10,944 --> 00:29:13,276
这么说只要我们把它跟寄主分开
So if we separate her from the main body...

582
00:29:13,583 --> 00:29:14,630
我保证剩下的部分
I'd wager the rest of it

583
00:29:14,631 --> 00:29:16,631
就跟老树根一样毫无活力了
becomes as lifeless as a dead tree trunk.

584
00:29:16,736 --> 00:29:19,454
这就是我刚才所说的病毒
Now, this is the virus I was telling you about.

585
00:29:19,525 --> 00:29:21,013
这是一种噬菌体
It's called a phage,

586
00:29:21,071 --> 00:29:24,142
至少从理论上说  它可以攻击并消灭
and it should, at least theoretically, be able to attack and eliminate

587
00:29:24,143 --> 00:29:27,143
珍妮弗血液中的病菌
the pathogen that's inside jennifer's bloodstream,

588
00:29:27,844 --> 00:29:29,368
如果我没猜错的话
and if I'm right about this,

589
00:29:29,602 --> 00:29:31,852
它将切断它们之间的连接
it should sever the connection.

590
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:34,407
但是?
What's the catch?

591
00:29:34,864 --> 00:29:37,137
还没有经过测试
Well, it's never been tested.

592
00:29:41,762 --> 00:29:43,711
我们暂时恢复一下能量供应
We turned the power back on briefly

593
00:29:43,712 --> 00:29:45,712
看看情况如何
to get a look inside the building.

594
00:29:45,864 --> 00:29:47,001
这是底层
This is the ground floor,

595
00:29:47,094 --> 00:29:49,626
跟隔离室相隔5层
five floors below the isolation room.

596
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:52,095
如你所看到的  通道几乎全被堵死了
As you can see, access is almost completely choked off,

597
00:29:52,096 --> 00:29:54,114
但想要实施我们的计划  得有人
but for this to work, I need someone

598
00:29:54,115 --> 00:29:56,115
走到凯勒床边帮她注射
to step right up to dr. Keller's bed and inject her.

599
00:29:56,243 --> 00:29:58,270
可以通过传送机前往比较靠近的地方  不过
Well, we can use the transporter to get them close, but--

600
00:29:58,271 --> 00:30:00,837
但还要在荆棘中行进至少50米
but you'd still have to run a gauntlet of over 50 meters.

601
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:03,239
而且在泽兰卡博士那件事以后
And after what happened to dr. Zelenka...

602
00:30:06,028 --> 00:30:07,235
你们应该明白我现在的困境
well, you understand my dilemma.

603
00:30:07,411 --> 00:30:08,560
是啊
Yeah.

604
00:30:09,556 --> 00:30:10,810
什么
What?

605
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:16,728
如果凯勒真的是这场危机的关键
If dr. Keller really is the key to this thing,

606
00:30:16,868 --> 00:30:18,696
有个更简单的方法
there is an easier way.

607
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:21,712
我们只需朝隔离室
We'd only need a couple of well-aimed shots

608
00:30:21,713 --> 00:30:23,713
开几炮就行了
at the isolation room.

609
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:26,032
等等  你指用飞弹?
Wait a second, you're talking about drones?

610
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:27,708
你要朝我们自己人发射飞弹?
You're going to fire drones at one of our own people?

611
00:30:27,709 --> 00:30:29,657
我也不想一来亚特兰蒂斯
I didn't come to atlantis with the intention of

612
00:30:29,658 --> 00:30:31,658
就牺牲手下的资深队员
killing one of my senior staff inside of a week,

613
00:30:31,798 --> 00:30:33,392
但不那样的话
but my only other option

614
00:30:33,393 --> 00:30:36,393
就要让其他人冒生命的危险...
is to risk someone else's life on a solution...

615
00:30:37,575 --> 00:30:40,798
而且这种方案还没有经过测试
that hasn't even been tested yet.

616
00:30:41,196 --> 00:30:43,552
按照规定这是不行的
Not exactly by the book.

617
00:30:43,763 --> 00:30:44,853
那就测试吧
So test it.

618
00:30:44,981 --> 00:30:47,056
我体内也有那种东西
I've got the same bug.

619
00:30:47,208 --> 00:30:48,321
现在就给我注射吧
I'll take a shot right now.

620
00:30:48,427 --> 00:30:49,997
不  不  不
No, no, no...

621
00:30:52,484 --> 00:30:54,219
我来
I'll do it.

622
00:30:57,245 --> 00:30:59,027
束缚带?
Restraints, huh?

623
00:31:01,083 --> 00:31:04,059
抱歉  不过你可能会有强烈反应
I'm sorry, but I'm anticipating a severe reaction.

624
00:31:04,282 --> 00:31:05,477
太好了
Oh, great.

625
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,763
你真的确定要这么做?
Now, you're absolutely sure about this?

626
00:31:08,049 --> 00:31:09,745
要知道  这可是迈克尔提供的配方
Remember, the formula comes from michael,

627
00:31:09,746 --> 00:31:10,746
就我们所知  这可能
so as far all we know, it could-

628
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:12,526
把我变成虫子?
turn me into a bug?

629
00:31:12,725 --> 00:31:13,850
又不是第一次了  来吧
Been there, done that.

630
00:31:13,851 --> 00:31:15,913
不  事实上  我是说
No, actually, I was going to say

631
00:31:15,936 --> 00:31:17,741
可能会让你送命
it could kill you.

632
00:31:18,831 --> 00:31:22,006
好了...给我打针吧
Just... give me the shot.

633
00:31:22,223 --> 00:31:23,529
好吧
Okay.

634
00:31:30,084 --> 00:31:32,780
药剂需要几分钟时间起效  所以...
Now, it should take a few minutes to kick in, so just...

635
00:31:33,003 --> 00:31:35,241
-放轻松  -好  我会...
- Try to relax. - Oh, okay, I'll just...

636
00:31:35,341 --> 00:31:36,981
我会放松的
I'll relax.

637
00:31:36,982 --> 00:31:39,002
卡森  罗恩和其他人已经有病症了
Carson, is it true that Lorne and some of the others

638
00:31:39,002 --> 00:31:40,602
是不是真的
are beginning to show symptoms?

639
00:31:40,603 --> 00:31:42,196
我想是的
Aye, I'm afraid so.

640
00:31:42,197 --> 00:31:43,626
天啊...
Oh, god...

641
00:31:43,638 --> 00:31:44,294
为什么
why?

642
00:31:44,295 --> 00:31:45,923
你觉得自己有什么不对劲的
Have you noticed something yourself?

643
00:31:46,028 --> 00:31:47,200
我老是手心出汗
Well, my palms are very sweaty,

644
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,200
还有口干舌燥
and my mouth is very dry,

645
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,200
心跳也很快
I'm having heart palpitations.

646
00:31:50,247 --> 00:31:53,364
这些都很正常  还有吗?
Okay, so, nothing out of the ordinary, then?

647
00:31:54,542 --> 00:31:55,667
感觉怎么样
How do you feel?

648
00:31:55,761 --> 00:31:58,057
没什么感觉
I don't feel anything.

649
00:31:58,339 --> 00:32:00,026
我甚至觉得...
I don't even think that...

650
00:32:00,741 --> 00:32:01,796
谢帕德?
Sheppard?

651
00:32:01,831 --> 00:32:03,565
博士...
Hey, doc...

652
00:32:04,901 --> 00:32:07,151
我想这抑制剂真是个好东西
I think these restraints were a good idea.

653
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:09,518
它起作用了
It's working.

654
00:32:16,625 --> 00:32:17,902
情况怎么样
What's our status?

655
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:20,037
包括医疗室在内的主要系统
Well, the infirmary, and a few other essential systems

656
00:32:20,037 --> 00:32:22,437
已经启用应急发电设备
have been switched to emergency generators.

657
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:23,902
都准备好了
We're ready.

658
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:25,918
好了  拔掉总闸
All right, pull the plug.

659
00:32:42,258 --> 00:32:42,979
看在上帝的份上  卡森
For god's sake, Carson,

660
00:32:42,998 --> 00:32:44,379
这要多久
how long's this going to go on for?

661
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,629
抱歉  罗德尼  我也不知道
I'm sorry, Rodney, I have no idea.

662
00:32:48,961 --> 00:32:50,625
博士...
Doc...

663
00:32:51,868 --> 00:32:53,321
他心跳停了  给他呼吸罩
His heart stopped. Bag him.

664
00:32:53,322 --> 00:32:54,586
把手术推车拿过来
Get a crash cart in here!

665
00:32:54,587 --> 00:32:55,711
准备好插管
Prepare to intubate.

666
00:32:55,712 --> 00:32:57,106
1，2，3
One, two, three.

667
00:32:57,107 --> 00:32:58,243
1，2，3
One, two, three.

668
00:32:58,244 --> 00:32:59,625
1，2，3
One, two, three.

669
00:32:59,626 --> 00:33:00,493
挺住
Come on.

670
00:33:00,494 --> 00:33:01,360
1，2，3
One, two, three.

671
00:33:01,407 --> 00:33:03,188
1，2，3
One, two, three.

672
00:33:06,997 --> 00:33:08,426
又有心跳了
He's back.

673
00:33:14,269 --> 00:33:15,769
我怎么样了
How'd I do?

674
00:33:19,633 --> 00:33:21,204
你确定起作用了吗
Are you sure it worked?

675
00:33:21,368 --> 00:33:22,798
血检显示为阴性
Well, the blood screen came up negative.

676
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:23,517
要我说
As far as I can tell,

677
00:33:23,517 --> 00:33:25,317
外星病毒已经清除了
the alien pathogen has been eliminated.

678
00:33:25,551 --> 00:33:26,548
做得好
Well done.

679
00:33:26,805 --> 00:33:28,751
现在我们要派个人去隔离室
Now we just need someone to go to the isolation room.

680
00:33:28,844 --> 00:33:29,899
-我去...  -我去
- I'll do it--  - I'll do it.

681
00:33:31,423 --> 00:33:33,206
我想使用这药剂
I assume no special medical skill is required

682
00:33:33,206 --> 00:33:35,126
不需要什么专业医疗技术吧
to administer the drug.

683
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,938
不需要  就是一个简单的注射
Well, no, not really. It's just a simple injection.

684
00:33:38,032 --> 00:33:39,201
那就现在的情况看
Well, then, given your condition,

685
00:33:39,201 --> 00:33:41,055
我是不会选你去的
I wouldn't make you my first choice.

686
00:33:41,056 --> 00:33:42,286
所以说了我去
That's why I said I'd do it.

687
00:33:42,287 --> 00:33:43,926
他不信任我们
He doesn't trust us,

688
00:33:44,301 --> 00:33:45,497
因为我们也被感染了
because we're still infected.

689
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:47,606
其实这样也没什么不好
Actually, that might not be a bad thing.

690
00:33:47,946 --> 00:33:50,442
谢帕德上校曾感染过伊瑞特斯虫的DNA
When Colonel Sheppard was infected with iratus bug dna,

691
00:33:50,723 --> 00:33:52,205
然后他就畅通无阻地进入巢穴
he was able to walk right into that nest

692
00:33:52,205 --> 00:33:54,055
不受到任何攻击
without being attacked.

693
00:33:54,063 --> 00:33:55,866
你是说感染病毒的人
You think someone infected with the pathogen

694
00:33:55,866 --> 00:33:57,766
反而更容易通过?
would be more likely to get through?

695
00:33:58,223 --> 00:33:59,653
很可能
Well, it's possible.

696
00:34:06,684 --> 00:34:07,821
好了  我进来了
All right, I'm in.

697
00:34:07,997 --> 00:34:10,587
切断运输机电源
Cut power to the transporter.

698
00:34:14,545 --> 00:34:15,530
情况怎么样
How does it look?

699
00:34:15,531 --> 00:34:17,463
不怎么样
Not so good.

700
00:34:21,891 --> 00:34:24,047
那鬼东西到处都是
The stuff's everywhere.

701
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:27,139
他对你有没有什么反应
Is it reacting to your presence in any way?

702
00:34:27,279 --> 00:34:28,568
没看出来
Not really.

703
00:34:29,436 --> 00:34:31,311
好吧  那...
All right, just...

704
00:34:31,926 --> 00:34:33,520
小心
be careful.

705
00:34:45,136 --> 00:34:46,237
发生了什么
What happened?

706
00:34:46,565 --> 00:34:48,050
药起作用了
It worked.

707
00:34:48,051 --> 00:34:49,051
他们派若楠去给她打一针
They just sent Ronon to give her the shot.

708
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,198
什么时候
When?

709
00:34:50,315 --> 00:34:51,033
他刚到那儿
He just got there. Look.

710
00:34:51,033 --> 00:34:53,233
我接入了通讯系统
I'm tapped into the intercom.

711
00:34:56,643 --> 00:34:58,811
若楠  情况怎样?
Ronon, what's your status?

712
00:34:58,812 --> 00:35:00,745
越来越难走了
Well, it's getting harder to move.

713
00:35:00,745 --> 00:35:02,245
这到处都是
There's too much of it.

714
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,241
尽量缓慢移动
Just... try not to make any sudden moves, or...

715
00:35:06,242 --> 00:35:07,218
不要有威胁性动作
threatening gestures.

716
00:35:07,665 --> 00:35:10,102
好的  我会记住的
Yeah, I'll keep that in mind.

717
00:35:15,528 --> 00:35:16,934
好了
All right,

718
00:35:17,344 --> 00:35:18,727
到了
that's it.

719
00:35:18,938 --> 00:35:20,649
我不能再靠近了
I don't think I can go any further.

720
00:35:20,731 --> 00:35:23,133
走廊都被堵住了
The corridor is completely blocked.

721
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:26,074
好了  你们要我怎么做?
All right, so what do you want me to do?

722
00:35:31,161 --> 00:35:33,657
-管它了  先弄个洞  -等等  若楠
- Screw it, I'm going to make a hole.  - Ronon, wait!

723
00:35:33,658 --> 00:35:35,218
你能走到那么远
The only reason you made it this far

724
00:35:35,218 --> 00:35:37,718
只是因为它感觉到了你血液里的病毒
is because it senses the pathogen in your bloodstream.

725
00:35:38,017 --> 00:35:39,435
它认为你是同伴
It thinks you're a friend.

726
00:35:39,635 --> 00:35:40,181
如果你开枪...
If you start shooting--

727
00:35:40,181 --> 00:35:42,681
还有谁有更好的点子?
Does anyone have any better ideas?

728
00:35:47,975 --> 00:35:48,971
你在干嘛?
What are you doing?

729
00:35:49,803 --> 00:35:50,858
如果我想得没错
If I'm right,

730
00:35:50,859 --> 00:35:52,756
我们犯了个大错误
this is about to go very, very wrong.

731
00:35:52,757 --> 00:35:53,600
你不能去
You can't.

732
00:35:53,682 --> 00:35:56,061
- 我们被隔离了  - 你忘了我已经好了?
- We're quarantined-- - I'm cured, remember?

733
00:35:56,851 --> 00:35:58,726
没有其他路可以走了
There's no other way through.

734
00:35:58,937 --> 00:36:00,084
一旦你开了枪
Once you start shooting,

735
00:36:00,084 --> 00:36:01,444
要马上离开
you'll have to move quickly.

736
00:36:01,608 --> 00:36:04,057
谢谢提醒
Thanks for the advice.

737
00:36:22,627 --> 00:36:24,092
若楠?
Ronon?

738
00:36:24,734 --> 00:36:26,374
若楠  你怎么样了
Ronon, what's your status?

739
00:36:27,177 --> 00:36:28,395
若楠  快回答
Ronon, come in!

740
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:29,989
天啊...
Oh, my god...

741
00:36:40,549 --> 00:36:41,850
现在什么情况
What's happening?

742
00:36:41,851 --> 00:36:43,584
我们失去联系了
We've lost contact.

743
00:36:44,654 --> 00:36:45,272
重启电源
Turn the power back on.

744
00:36:45,272 --> 00:36:46,772
开通隔离室的通讯频道
Open up a channel to the isolation room.

745
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,541
什么  为什么
What? Why?

746
00:36:48,717 --> 00:36:49,936
只管照做
Just do it.

747
00:36:52,621 --> 00:36:54,543
好了  频道通了
All right, you have a channel.

748
00:36:55,539 --> 00:36:57,871
凯勒博士  我是谢帕德上校  听得到吗
Dr. Keller, this is Colonel Sheppard, do you read?

749
00:36:58,117 --> 00:37:01,410
我能听到  上校  但我不是凯勒博士
I hear you, Colonel, but I'm not Dr. Keller anymore.

750
00:37:03,637 --> 00:37:05,031
那你是谁
Well, who are you?

751
00:37:05,055 --> 00:37:06,304
我还没名字
I have no designation yet.

752
00:37:06,304 --> 00:37:09,004
当我完成时就会有了
I'll be given one when I'm complete.

753
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:10,645
若楠怎么了
What about Ronon?

754
00:37:10,739 --> 00:37:12,145
你指那个入侵者?
You mean the intruder?

755
00:37:12,257 --> 00:37:14,015
他还活着  暂时
He's alive, for the moment.

756
00:37:14,016 --> 00:37:16,160
他即将被消灭
He's been neutralized.

757
00:37:16,242 --> 00:37:18,023
我能感觉到他的脉搏
I can feel his pulse.

758
00:37:18,199 --> 00:37:19,195
很弱
It's weak.

759
00:37:19,347 --> 00:37:22,581
只需轻轻攥一下就能结束
It would only take the slightest squeeze.

760
00:37:22,934 --> 00:37:23,803
你不能这么做
Yeah, but you don't want to do that

761
00:37:23,803 --> 00:37:26,403
你们是一伙儿的记得吗
because he's one of you, remember?

762
00:37:27,692 --> 00:37:29,309
让她说话
Keep her talking.

763
00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:30,551
你去哪儿?
Where are you going?

764
00:37:30,563 --> 00:37:32,403
结束这一切
I'm going to go finish this.

765
00:37:35,368 --> 00:37:37,747
珍妮弗  我是卡森
Jennifer, this is Carson.

766
00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:40,024
贝克特博士  我说过了
Dr. Beckett, I already told you,

767
00:37:40,025 --> 00:37:42,025
我已经不是珍妮弗·凯勒了
I'm not jennifer keller anymore.

768
00:37:42,091 --> 00:37:43,791
她能听到你的声音
You're the voice she was hearing,

769
00:37:43,896 --> 00:37:45,982
你只是控制了她大脑的语言功能
the part of her mind that was taking over.

770
00:37:45,983 --> 00:37:47,119
你们阻止不了我
You can't stop me.

771
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,580
我将会如期完成
I will become as I was meant to be.

772
00:37:56,603 --> 00:37:58,782
谢帕德上校启动了小飞船
Colonel Sheppard is powering up a jumper.

773
00:37:58,783 --> 00:38:00,376
给我一条安全频道
Get me a secure channel.

774
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:02,192
谢帕德  你在干嘛
Sheppard, what are you doing?

775
00:38:02,193 --> 00:38:03,763
抄点近路
I'm taking a little short-cut.

776
00:38:03,764 --> 00:38:06,306
抱歉我来不及填申请文件了
Sorry I didn't have time to fill out the paperwork.

777
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:14,450
好了  我看见了
Okay, I see it now.

778
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:18,048
这东西到处都是了
That stuff is growing all over the place.

779
00:38:18,892 --> 00:38:20,286
这可能有点疼
This may hurt.

780
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,926
谢帕德上校  请回复
Colonel Sheppard, report.

781
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:40,032
谢帕德上校?
Colonel Sheppard?

782
00:40:08,186 --> 00:40:10,483
谢帕德上校  报告你的情况
Colonel Sheppard, what's your status?

783
00:40:11,749 --> 00:40:13,155
谢帕德上校...
Colonel Sheppard...

784
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,058
我好很多了
I've been better.

785
00:40:17,712 --> 00:40:19,435
发生了什么
What happened?

786
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:23,744
你最好派人来接我们
You'd better come get us.

787
00:40:30,797 --> 00:40:31,969
若楠怎么样
How's Ronon?

788
00:40:32,285 --> 00:40:34,066
他喉部损伤
He has a bruised larynx.

789
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:37,734
显然他要有几天不能说话了
Apparently he won't be able to speak for several days.

790
00:40:38,143 --> 00:40:40,429
大概没几个人会发现都什么不同
I wonder if anyone will notice the difference.

791
00:40:41,765 --> 00:40:42,679
谢帕德上校?
Colonel Sheppard?

792
00:40:42,995 --> 00:40:44,835
看看谁从隔离室出来了
Look who's finally out of isolation.

793
00:40:45,386 --> 00:40:47,378
很高兴看到你  医生
Oh, it's good to see you, doc.

794
00:40:47,483 --> 00:40:48,796
你感觉怎样
How you feeling?

795
00:40:49,646 --> 00:40:51,486
就是呼吸时有点疼
It only hurts when I breathe.

796
00:40:52,037 --> 00:40:52,998
这感觉可不好
I feel really bad.

797
00:40:52,999 --> 00:40:55,022
好像我的恢复
It looks like my recovery's going to be

798
00:40:55,022 --> 00:40:56,022
比你还快
a lot easier than yours.

799
00:40:56,023 --> 00:40:57,018
那没什么
That's all right.

800
00:40:57,170 --> 00:41:00,042
现在有两个医生照顾我
I've got two doctors looking after me now.

801
00:41:00,768 --> 00:41:02,631
我想你误会了
Well, no, I'm afraid not.

802
00:41:02,866 --> 00:41:04,881
我今天下午就要走了
I'm scheduled to leave this afternoon.

803
00:41:05,315 --> 00:41:06,909
当然  除非
That is, unless of course

804
00:41:06,915 --> 00:41:08,409
未来一小时内又出现了巨大的险情
there's a major crisis in the next hour or so.

805
00:41:08,596 --> 00:41:11,690
那样也不会令我吃惊
It wouldn't surprise me.

806
00:41:11,901 --> 00:41:14,045
好了  你自己要小心点
Well, listen, you keep yourself out of trouble,

807
00:41:14,268 --> 00:41:16,237
我们马上就会再见的
and I'll see you real soon.

808
00:41:16,659 --> 00:41:17,596
祝你好运  卡森
Good luck, carson.

809
00:41:17,784 --> 00:41:19,108
谢了  约翰
Thanks, John.

810
00:41:19,799 --> 00:41:21,534
欢迎回来  凯勒医生
Welcome back, Dr. Keller,

811
00:41:21,815 --> 00:41:23,713
贝克特博士
and Dr. Beckett...

812
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:26,193
谢谢
Thank you.

813
00:41:26,204 --> 00:41:27,974
太客气了  伍尔希先生
My pleasure, Mr. Woolsey.

814
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,119
我下来之前
Before I came down here,

815
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:37,319
刚和以前在地球的上级通了电话
I was on a call with my superiors back on earth.

816
00:41:37,815 --> 00:41:40,627
他们在审查我的初步报告
They were going over my preliminary report.

817
00:41:40,997 --> 00:41:42,520
你说了什么
What did you tell them?

818
00:41:42,684 --> 00:41:43,599
真相
The truth.

819
00:41:44,114 --> 00:41:46,470
我只做了三天的总指挥
That in my first three days as commander,

820
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:50,466
我违反了至少一半的安全条例
I violated at least half a dozen basic security protocols.

821
00:41:50,467 --> 00:41:52,130
有那么多?
That many, huh?

822
00:41:53,431 --> 00:41:55,329
我让贝克特来做这项调查
I let Beckett run the investigation,

823
00:41:55,727 --> 00:41:57,201
不考虑他的身体状况
in spite of his condition and the fact that

824
00:41:57,201 --> 00:42:00,028
而且他已经不算是探险队的成员了
he's technically no longer a member of this expedition.

825
00:42:01,411 --> 00:42:03,520
我让若楠去分发解毒剂了
I sent Ronon to deliver the antidote

826
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,524
尽管他也被感染了
even though he was infected.

827
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,720
我牺牲基地的安全
I compromised the safety of this base

828
00:42:10,177 --> 00:42:13,036
来解救一个可能救不了的人
to rescue someone who may well have been beyond our help anyway.

829
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,267
但她不是
But she wasn't,

830
00:42:14,384 --> 00:42:15,462
而且我们把她救出来了
and we got her out.

831
00:42:15,485 --> 00:42:17,505
如果你死板教条
And if you had played by the rules,

832
00:42:17,505 --> 00:42:19,505
她早就死了
she'd be dead right now.

833
00:42:21,942 --> 00:42:23,653
勘查组织可能会同意你的看法
The IOA would seem to agree with you.

834
00:42:23,688 --> 00:42:27,251
显然  他们想大事化小小事化了
Apparently, they're willing to let the matter drop.

835
00:42:28,985 --> 00:42:30,849
那还有什么问题
