1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,240
<i>Previously on Dracula...</i>

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,750
It'll be my honor to host your engagement party.

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:06,780
Things will never be the same.

4
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,190
You are to be married, and that is that.

5
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:10,630
She is Ilona.

6
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:13,680
You must never again mention Mina Murray's resemblance to my wife.

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,900
I need your blood to create a serum so you are able to conquer daylight.

8
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,580
I want you to find out everything about this General Shaw.

9
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,700
He's a powerful ally of my competitors.

10
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,590
Vera Markham can tell you all you need to know about Shaw.

11
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:28,060
Yes?

12
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,420
You wish to employ my services

13
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,790
in order to get Mr. Renfield to answer one question.

14
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:04,330
Mr. Grayson. What are you doing here?

15
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:07,580
I know I shouldn't be here, but there's no time.

16
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:08,780
Time for what?

17
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,560
No. You must leave, immediately, or... I'll go.

18
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:15,150
I promise.

19
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,480
But I must tell you, you're making a mistake.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,360
A terrible mistake.

21
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,980
- What do you mean? - Harker.

22
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:28,080
He'll never be able to make you happy, and you know it.

23
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:29,920
How dare you.

24
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,950
Now is not the time for lies, Mina.

25
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,690
You know it's the truth. If it isn't, say it.

26
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:39,360
Look me in the eyes and say it,

27
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,230
- and I'll go. - No, no, no.

28
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:45,340
- I... I love... I love Jonathan, and no other,

29
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,140
and he will be my husband.

30
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,520
Of all the days to lie-in.

31
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,990
Don't you know we have a million things to do before tonight?

32
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:39,150
- It's still on? - Of course it's still on!

33
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:44,230
- Unless you've reconsidered. - No. No. No, of course not.

34
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,040
Well then, for goodness' sake, get up, darling.

35
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,090
You mustn't waste another second of this momentous day.

36
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:53,550
Yours is going to be

37
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,570
the most spectacular engagement party London has ever seen.

38
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,600
Be careful. That's very fragile.

39
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,190
Come and meet your first test subject.

40
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,710
Place it in line with the door, please.

41
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,550
And no obstruction that may cast a shadow!

42
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,040
I wouldn't get too close, Professor.

43
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,200
I think you'll find her suitable, if not exactly agreeable.

44
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,410
There are many technical challenges,

45
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,890
but I believe we will surmount them, given time.

46
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,560
Time is a luxury we do not have.

47
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,010
I must walk in sunlight soon.

48
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,690
People are getting suspicious.

49
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,620
Do you understand?

50
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,770
By the way, where's Renfield?

51
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,650
He was meant to accompany the lab equipment.

52
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:04,640
Renfield was nowhere to be found. I had to do it myself.

53
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,520
Mr. Renfield.

54
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,960
We are about to embark on a journey, you and I.

55
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,990
It begins with a single question,

56
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:28,010
and it ends with your answer to that question.

57
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:38,150
I want you to remember that, so I will say it again.

58
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:42,170
It ends with your answer.

59
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:46,060
So you see, no matter how helpless you may feel,

60
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:50,870
no matter how lengthy, debasing, and disagreeable

61
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,280
the journey may prove,

62
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:56,010
ultimately, you are in control.

63
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,790
Let's get started, shall we?

64
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,400
Though I take great pride in my profession,

65
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,240
it has become...

66
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:16,150
tedious of late.

67
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,370
There are, after all,

68
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:25,310
only so many variations on a theme one can play.

69
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,370
Release me.

70
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,640
Each client is unique, of course.

71
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,020
The methods vary,

72
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,720
but the result is inevitably the same.

73
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,690
I'm warning you,

74
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,830
there will be repercussions.

75
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:54,030
I often think, "Perhaps this time, Janina.

76
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,580
"This time, for once,

77
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,480
"the client will dispense with all the bluster and defiance

78
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,470
and simply answer the question the first time I ask it. "

79
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:16,670
Who does Alexander Grayson love?

80
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,990
Oh, well.

81
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,810
Perhaps next time.

82
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,650

85
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,690
These are General Shaw's personal accounts.

86
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:02,350
It's all there, under Bellamy Limited.

87
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,320
Bellamy?

88
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:06,580
Sole shareholder, empire munitions.

89
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,950
Empire munitions?

90
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,360
Shaw's receiving money from an arms manufacturer?

91
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,630
60,000 pounds in July.

92
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:23,300
July, that's when... That's when the empire won the tender for eight new warships.

93
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,170
He got commission.

94
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:28,250
General Shaw is taking bribes.

95
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,590
Harker, please.

96
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,510
What do you plan to do with this information?

97
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,760
I know you begged me to organize this party

98
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:52,230
and I agreed, but that doesn't give you the right to be an idle princess.

99
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:55,070
You have the guest list. I have the replies.

100
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:59,120
You check the former against the latter, and the kitchen needs the final count by noon.

101
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,310
This list, it's all wrong.

102
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,550
Lord Davenport. Lord Rothcroft?

103
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:08,590
Who'd ever have guessed that Jonathan had such distinguished friends?

104
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:09,650
Yes, but they're not his friends.

105
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,860
At least, he's never mentioned them.

106
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:15,510
All my doing, I'm afraid. I insisted he invite them.

107
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:18,610
It's all rather overwhelming, Mr. Grayson.

108
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,080
Are you sure it's not too much of an imposition?

109
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:21,960
Not at all.

110
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:27,640
This is just an empty stage upon which Miss Westenra has lavished her formidable magic.

111
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,550
At least somebody appreciates all my hard work.

112
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,560
Alexander! You won't believe what...

113
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:34,300
Mina.

114
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,900
Could we have a word privately, please?

115
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,100
Ladies, if you will excuse us.

116
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:45,650
Shaw is far from a saint, and I've got - the evidence to prove it. - Not now.

117
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,010
- I've just had a meeting. - I said, leave it.

118
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:59,160
Lucy, you'll probably think me a spoiled child...

119
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:00,590
Impossible.

120
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:02,920
What's wrong?

121
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:08,970
I had the most perplexing dream.

122
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:11,040
Really?

123
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,170
That kind of dream?

124
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:16,530
No. Not that kind of dream. Tell me...

125
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,460
Was the dream version of Jonathan more circumspect,

126
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,780
or was it merely a matter of circumference?

127
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,710
No. And it wasn't even...

128
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,000
It wasn't even Jonathan.

129
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,750
Yes, of course. Of course it was Jonathan.

130
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,550
Renfield went to Victoria Station last night to pick up some laboratory equipment.

131
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:47,310
He never arrived, and he has not been heard from since.

132
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,430
Well, perhaps he was detained.

133
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,500
He's been missing nine hours.

134
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,640
He would have sent word. Shall I contact the police?

135
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,230
No, no. No police.

136
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,110
This must be handled with the utmost discretion.

137
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:06,170
At this point of our business, Grayson Energy cannot afford a scandal.

138
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,950
I'm sure you understand that more than anyone.

139
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:08,860
Of course.

140
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,130
Well, I'll start with the hospitals, the morgues.

141
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,020
Did he have any appointments prior to picking up the equipment?

142
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,010
Only to gather some information from local steel mills.

143
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,090
Well, that narrows things down a bit.

144
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,360
He's hardly inconspicuous.

145
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:26,850
Leave it with me.

146
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:31,630
Jonathan?

147
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,750
I really must be going, Mina. Wa... Is this list right?

148
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,530
I'm sorry.

149
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:37,240
I- I have some urgent business to attend to.

150
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,570
We'll have to discuss this later.

151
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,640
But the party is tonight. It's in a few hours.

152
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:45,330
Well, I-I made a few additions, is all.

153
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,930
Business acquaintances and so forth.

154
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:50,260
It's not the additions that concern me, it's the people you have disinvited.

155
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,110
Like who?

156
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,420
All your friends at the paper. Szabo.

157
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,370
Szabo?

158
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,220
Think, Mina. We're serving alcohol.

159
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:00,120
Do you really want him juggling champagne bottles and doing his dancing bear routine?

160
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,190
I'm sure he will behave himself. The answer is no!

161
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,700
We're moving up in the world, and its only natural that we're gonna lose

162
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,920
a few friends on the way.

163
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,690
Would you listen to yourself?

164
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,370
So, who else will be in attendance?

165
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:20,770
Rothcroft. A few others.

166
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:24,360
I do hope there won't be another grand spectacle this evening.

167
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:28,790
Brash Americans like Grayson are best left twisting in the wind.

168
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:31,300
Once they realize their money can't buy cooperation,

169
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:35,010
they pack up and move on... unless provoked.

170
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:37,660
Of course, sir. No.

171
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,380
There should never be any direct action against Grayson

172
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,870
without your express permission.

173
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,670
I thought you'd be at Carfax with Lucy.

174
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:59,260
I was, but I thought I'd come home and rest a while.

175
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,640
Your mother would be so proud of you.

176
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,640
You've found a fine man in Jonathan.

177
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,000
I know she'd be happy with your choice.

178
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:22,270
A month ago, perhaps, with the old Jonathan.

179
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:25,600
But he's changed.

180
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:28,780
In what way?

181
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:33,820
Well, to start with, he's got an entirely new set of friends...

182
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,560
business associates, most of them...

183
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:39,350
and they're titled and wealthy and much older than he is.

184
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:40,410
That's perfectly natural.

185
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:43,490
He's in a new line, he's bound to make new acquaintances.

186
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:46,650
Yes, but he's cut ties with most, if not all,

187
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:49,040
of his old friends, as though they're expendable.

188
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,460
And I can't help but think...

189
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,820
That you might become expendable as well?

190
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,240
I must admit, Mr. Renfield...

191
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,870
Your stoicism is impressive,

192
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:06,910
but by no means a surprise.

193
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:11,400
- Rodrigo? - No.

194
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,350
Please.

195
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,370
Oh, you are strong...

196
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,670
And clearly no stranger to suffering.

197
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,800
Admirable traits

198
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:37,670
under virtually every other circumstance.

199
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,650
Alas, Mr. Renfield,

200
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:48,290
not here, not now.

201
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:51,180
There is just me and you.

202
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:58,400
The question... and the answer!

203
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:04,050
Who does Alexander Grayson love?

204
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:29,830
Renfield's been abducted. By whom?

205
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,860
We can only assume it's the Order.

206
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,590
But until the sun goes down, I'm powerless to help him.

207
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,110
Do you think they can break him?

208
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:41,110
He will die before he says a word against me.

209
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,310
Very well, then. Problem solved.

210
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:48,080
We cannot let anything distract us from today's test.

211
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,850
How long will this entire process take?

212
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:57,390
I will use the resonator to generate voltage to a pair of electrical paddles,

213
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:01,090
then apply them to the subject's chest

214
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:03,580
and attempt to jolt the heart into beating.

215
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,020
Then I will give the subject a massive injection of the serum.

216
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,640
If it works,

217
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,810
you will immediately repeat the whole process on me.

218
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,450
But I won't have an adequate supply of the serum.

219
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:21,410
As you can see, it's a slow process.

220
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,980
I don't have the equipment!

221
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:31,820
EMPIRE AND COLONIAL
METALLURGY

222
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,160
Hold a second.

223
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,360
- Excuse me. - Yes, sir?

224
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,940
A PLATNIK

225
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:37,240
12 YEARS EARLIER

226
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,630
I'm looking for a Mr. Havershim.

227
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:00,570
If it's business, call my St. Louis office.

228
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,560
I have called your St. Louis office,

229
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,850
and your Kansas City office, and your Carson City office.

230
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,620
Don't tell me, let me guess.

231
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,870
You're Alexander Grayson.

232
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,080
That's correct.

233
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,110
And you want to buy my Sweetwater operation.

234
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23,580
And your Doubletree mine.

235
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,660
I am willing to offer you 20,000 of your American dollars.

236
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,490
Really?

237
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:49,860
Impressive.

238
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:55,250
Mr. Grayson, you are either a very brave man

239
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:58,050
or a very foolish one.

240
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,120
This is a rough country to be traveling unarmed.

241
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,460
I don't like guns.

242
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:13,360
This is a singularly

243
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,920
inopportune moment to purchase a mine, sir.

244
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,240
What the hell?

245
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,390
Federal taxes on minerals are set to escalate,

246
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:24,700
so if you insist on making the purchase, make sure you tender an option

247
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:28,270
with a leaseback provision to avoid the levies.

248
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,310
Whiskey, sir?

249
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:31,430
Thank you.

250
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,490
And what's your name?

251
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:40,030
Renfield. R.M. Renfield, esquire.

252
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,490
Alexander!

253
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,890
You were right.

254
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:49,520
Renfield was abducted outside of Empire and Colonial yesterday afternoon around 4:00.

255
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,600
I found a newspaper vendor. He witnessed the whole thing.

256
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,920
- Did he give a description? - Mm, three men.

257
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,850
One hit him, the others grabbed him and threw him into a carriage.

258
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,040
- Did he notify the police? - He assumed it was the police.

259
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,090
I found this.

260
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:07,350
Where?

261
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,650
In the gutter just outside the main entrance.

262
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,460
Shall I notify the police?

263
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:17,320
No. This is all I need.

264
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,830
I was beginning to think I would be forced to start without you.

265
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,740
I had an urgent matter to attend to.

266
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,060
And what could be more urgent than this?

267
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,860
I finally have a lead on Renfield.

268
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:38,430
Shall we proceed?

269
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,880
First, we start its heart.

270
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,950
1,000 volts, circuit one.

271
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:18,050
3,000 volts!

272
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,780
3,000 volts, circuit one.

273
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,180
It's beating.

274
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,650
Success.

275
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:15,450
You can't leave now!

276
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,830
I must find Renfield.

277
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:20,410
You are about to host a party

278
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:23,550
at which known members of the Order will be present.

279
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:26,550
Professor, if you ever valued that arm, take it off mine...

280
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:27,950
immediately!

281
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:05,650
EMPIRE AND COLONIAL
METALLURGY

282
00:23:58,810 --> 00:23:59,770
Hello.

283
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,070
Thank you.

284
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,200
- Back in a tick, darling. - Okay.

285
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,620
Lovely to see you.

286
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,980
I promised him I will not do my dancing bear.

287
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:18,330
I think it's time for me to see to the women.

288
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,120
If you will excuse me.

289
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,520
- Jonathan. - Dr. Murray.

290
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,300
Mina, you look lovely.

291
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:30,470
Thank you.

292
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:39,840
You were right. I was beginning to forget who I am.

293
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,560
I never will.

294
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,630
And I will always be here to remind you.

295
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:48,470
Promise?

296
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:04,040
I hope Mr. Grayson likes what we've done with the place.

297
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:05,600
Well, he... He hasn't arrived?

298
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,130
Mm-mm, no, not yet. He's still to arrive.

299
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,200
Who does Mr. Grayson love?

300
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:18,490
Mr. Renfield, who does he love?

301
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:23,950
Who does Mr. Alexander Grayson love?

302
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:28,710
I am willing to offer you 20,000 of your American dollars.

303
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,060
Mr. Grayson, you are either a very brave man...

304
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,770
or a very foolish one.

305
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,490
This is a rough country to be traveling unarmed.

306
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:43,410
This is a singularly inopportune moment to purchase a mine, sir.

307
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:47,350
What the hell? Federal taxes are set to escalate,

308
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:50,550
so if you insist on making the purchase,

309
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:52,160
make sure you tender an option

310
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,600
with a leaseback provision to avoid the levies.

311
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:56,910
Whiskey, sir?

312
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:00,630
Thank you. They mean to kill you.

313
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,570
That's enough outta you.

314
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:06,410
You think you're so smart? Huh?

315
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:09,280
Come on, boys! Join in.

316
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,780
You're safe now.

317
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:56,360
Mr. Renfield?

318
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,470
Mr. Renfield.

319
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:03,900
Who does Grayson love?

320
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:08,070
Curious. No sign of the ringmaster.

321
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:11,960
No doubt choreographing his grand entrance.
I actually meant his man.

322
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,320
You know, the very large one who makes all the turgid announcements.

323
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:16,400
What's his name?

324
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,810
Speaking of grand entrances.

325
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:25,750
- She's looking for Grayson. - How can you tell?

326
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,770
Because he's the only one who isn't here. Poor thing.

327
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,940
Spent her best years having any man she pleases, but now?

328
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:37,140
Lady Wetherby faces the unpleasant prospect of not having the one man she really wants

329
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,400
while her husband withers away in his sickbed.

330
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:05,000
I apologize for being late. I hope everything is as you wish, Miss Murray.

331
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,910
Thank you so much, for everything.

332
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,740
You look very lovely.

333
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,920
You'll have to excuse me, hmm?

334
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,840
- Thank you, incidentally. - What for?

335
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:24,270
With your help, we managed to locate Renfield.

336
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,340
Suffice it to say, all is good,

337
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:29,010
though I'm no closer to knowing who's responsible.

338
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,430
- Is he... - He's quite all right. I assure you.

339
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:35,980
Now, what's this interesting news you have regarding General Shaw?

340
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:37,600
- Quite the party. - Mm.

341
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:39,980
He must be a very valuable employee.

342
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:50,290
What do you think of Harker?

343
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:54,050
I think he could be useful. And if anything, he's ambitious.

344
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:57,400
Surely you're not thinking of recruitment. Well, he's a little rough around the edges,

345
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,410
but we could always use some fresh blood.

346
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,070
The more Britain arms itself for war against the Ottomans,

347
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:03,540
the more General Shaw stands to gain.

348
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:06,240
On virtually every munitions deal this country makes,

349
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:07,600
he's getting a cut.

350
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:10,970
10% of the total value of the contracts.

351
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:15,400
Harker, these allegations... More than allegations.

352
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,650
I've checked his accounts. They're meticulous.

353
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:21,200
Look, Harker, my intention was to embarrass the man,

354
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:23,530
not have him dragged up on charges.

355
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:28,720
But Shaw's a hypocrite. A traitor of the highest order.

356
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,620
You're not suggesting I just let this go, are you?

357
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,560
Mr. Grayson, and the groom.

358
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:39,740
Lady Jayne Wetherby. I invited her. I hope you don't mind.

359
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:40,730
Of course not.

360
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:43,590
Um, if you'll excuse me.

361
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:45,980
Harker.

362
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:49,650
I've missed you.

363
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:58,030
You look absolutely ravishing.

364
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:01,530
Oh, far better to be ravished.

365
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,850
Where have you been keeping yourself?

366
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:08,620
It seems somebody abducted and tortured my man, Renfield.

367
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:09,970
Oh, good lord!

368
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:12,890
Why would someone do something like that?

369
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,250
Probably some old business rival.

370
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,830
And don't worry. It's all been resolved.

371
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,000
- Shall we? - Yes.

372
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:33,210
Uh, Mr. Grayson? Please let me introduce you to my employer.

373
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:37,790
Uh, Mr. Grayson, um, Lady Wetherby, this is Mr. Browning.

374
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,710
- Mr. Browning. - Mr. Grayson.

375
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,730
- Lord Davenport. - We've met.

376
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,800
Lord Rothcroft.

377
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,880
- Lord Rothcroft. - Mr. Grayson.

378
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,700
- And Lord Godalming. - Lord Godalming.

379
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,770
Welcome to my home. Very kind of you to have us.

380
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,170
Uh, gentlemen, please excuse us.

381
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,020
I cannot wait to get you to myself.

382
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,330
Hmm, and so you shall.

383
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:04,690
Mr. Grayson.

384
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:27,000
Excuse me, Mr. Grayson?

385
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,450
I would like you to meet my mentor and my friend,

386
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:33,610
Professor Van Helsing.

387
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,300
It's a pleasure to meet you, Professor Van Helsing.

388
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,960
Honored to meet you.

389
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,650
The Professor is a pioneer in his field.

390
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:41,820
Is that so?

391
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,380
Grayson's man, Mr. Renfield, was abducted.

392
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,600
- Really? - Mm.

393
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:58,290
Abducted and tortured. Was that Order business?

394
00:32:58,530 --> 00:32:59,510
Absolutely not.

395
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:07,240
Mr. Grayson's been kind enough to give us his home for our celebration tonight.

396
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,130
How remarkably generous of him.

397
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:12,420
Thank you, Professor. A pleasure.

398
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,160
Miss Murray.

399
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,650
Professor?

400
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,530
Is everything all right?

401
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:38,670
Excuse me.

402
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:44,570
All right, ladies and gentlemen.

403
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:49,830
For my beautiful daughter, Mina, who has always made me proud,

404
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,010
and for Jonathan, who I have long considered a son.

405
00:33:53,880 --> 00:34:00,110
Mina, I only wish your mother were here to witness the woman that you've become.

406
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:04,840
Please, join me in raising a glass to the happy couple.

407
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:08,830
To Mina and Jonathan. To Mina and Jonathan!

408
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,370
Uh, ladies and gentlemen.

409
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:22,250
I'd, um, well, I would like to start by thanking Dr. Murray,

410
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:25,120
not just for his kind words this evening

411
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:28,030
but for a whole lifetime of kindness,

412
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:31,440
culminating in him allowing me to marry his daughter!

413
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:36,700
I say "allowing," but, um, anyone who knows Mina

414
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:38,810
knows that she follows her own path,

415
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:42,770
and that path... that path has led her to make me

416
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:45,550
the very happiest and very luckiest man alive.

417
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:46,870
Hear, hear.

418
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:48,110
Mr. Grayson!

419
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,030
Tonight's festivities are nothing short of spectacular.

420
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:54,420
Now I've thought long and hard about how best to express

421
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,850
my gratitude to you,

422
00:34:56,450 --> 00:35:01,160
and in the end, decided that it's right for me to offer you

423
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,200
what I consider most precious...

424
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,050
The privilege of the first dance.

425
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:17,690
May I cut in?

426
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,420
Excuse me. I need some air.

427
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,870
Grayson has a secret. I can tell.

428
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:45,830
And what might that be?

429
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,260
I'm not entirely sure.

430
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:51,140
He's a man of mystery without biography.

431
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:54,110
Well, that's hardly unusual for an American.

432
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:56,530
Those who oppose him frequently end up dead.

433
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:59,080
Those that oppose you frequently end up dead.

434
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,890
It's coincidence. Nothing more.

435
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:07,120
Speaking of which, his arrival in London

436
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,810
coincided with something rather more ominous.

437
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:10,800
Which is?

438
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,530
The advent of the old one you seek.

439
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,690
I brought you the old one's ashes in a jar.

440
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:18,660
Did you?

441
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:24,240
Alexander Grayson, a vamp...

442
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,610
Ridiculous. Never.

443
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,660
You would not be the first woman to be blinded by desire.

444
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,940
The first huntsman, yes...

445
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,610
but not the first woman.

446
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:06,320
Go away!

447
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:06,370
A lot of information I learned here in New York while I was studying law

448
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:09,410
under Charles Remick, a white abolitionist.

449
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,590
He made a motion I be examined under the Missouri bar.

450
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,360
I presume you passed.

451
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:18,300
I joined a firm in St. Louis

452
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,600
and was sent out west to sort out a cross-claim.

453
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:23,550
The client took exception to my race.

454
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:26,360
I was set upon by ruffians, and imprisoned

455
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:29,170
for the crime of defending myself.

456
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:31,410
What about the firm in St. Louis?

457
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:33,430
Well, they washed their hands of me.

458
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:36,050
I suspect that was their intent all along.

459
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:40,430
I was left friendless and penniless.

460
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,010
Suffice to say...

461
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:45,960
things did not go to plan.

462
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:58,460
I'm very grateful for this, sir.

463
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:04,320
I hope I don't undermine that gratitude by asking, "Why?"

464
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:06,640
You're a lawyer of the highest caliber, Renfield.

465
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:09,090
I require a lawyer.

466
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:21,230
I too know what it's like to live as an outcast,

467
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:25,980
outside what passes for polite society, but rarely is.

468
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,390
More than you could possibly imagine.

469
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:35,660
You are a man of secrets, Mr. Grayson.

470
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:38,200
That much, I can see.

471
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:41,870
But I owe it to my profession and my good name

472
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:46,140
to tell you that I can only work for a man who trusts me completely.

473
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,800
Then you shall know all my secrets,

474
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,350
and your life will never be the same.

475
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,740
Is that a promise?

476
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:29,430
