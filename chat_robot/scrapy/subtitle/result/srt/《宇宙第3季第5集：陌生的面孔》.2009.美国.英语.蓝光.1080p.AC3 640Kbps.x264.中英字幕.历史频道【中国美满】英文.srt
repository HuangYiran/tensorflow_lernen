2
00:00:01,584 --> 00:00:04,044
In the beginning, there was darkness...

3
00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:06,171
and then, bang...

4
00:00:06,214 --> 00:00:09,383
giving birth to an endless expanding existence...

5
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:11,969
of time, space, and matter.

6
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,263
Now, see further than we've ever imagined...

7
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:16,557
beyond the limits of our existence...

8
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:19,268
in a place we call " The Universe. "

9
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,648
They roam the planetary surface...

10
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:28,277
fly under water...

11
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:31,363
and soar through the heavens.

12
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:39,204
But this is no wildlife safari on planet Earth.

13
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:42,791
This is an expedition of astronomical proportions.

14
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:44,668
Everything looks good from here.

15
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,587
Okay, we copy that.

16
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:51,258
When the human race discovers it is not alone...

17
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:54,511
what will our cosmic brothers and sisters look like?

18
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:59,016
To answer this question, leading astronomers and astrobiologists...

19
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,685
have applied the principles of evolution and physics...

20
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:07,066
to five types of alien worlds likely to be found in the cosmos.

21
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:10,110
These are the creatures that could be out there.

22
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,619
Prepare to take an intergalactic safari...

23
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:22,831
and peer directly into the eyes of " Alien Faces. "

24
00:01:27,661 --> 00:01:31,831

25
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,263
The universe...

26
00:01:46,155 --> 00:01:48,615
an intergalactic sanctuary...

27
00:01:48,658 --> 00:01:50,826
of billions of galaxies...

28
00:01:53,704 --> 00:01:55,622
and trillions of stars.

29
00:02:09,846 --> 00:02:13,265
Could it only be a lifeless, barren wasteland...

30
00:02:13,307 --> 00:02:15,100
of gamma-ray bursts...

31
00:02:16,352 --> 00:02:17,894
burning stars...

32
00:02:21,315 --> 00:02:22,357
and black holes?

33
00:02:27,196 --> 00:02:32,033
Or does life exist beyond Earth in this cosmic paradise?

34
00:02:33,744 --> 00:02:39,666
Do alien faces gaze towards us, pondering the age-old question...

35
00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:41,626
are we alone?

36
00:02:43,504 --> 00:02:45,297
Scientists are still searching...

37
00:02:45,339 --> 00:02:48,008
for the first signs of life beyond our planet...

38
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:53,221
but many are convinced it's out there, waiting for us to find it.

39
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:57,726
But what on Earth, if anything, would it look like?

40
00:02:59,854 --> 00:03:05,192
With a potent mix of earth science, logic, and the theory of evolution...

41
00:03:05,234 --> 00:03:07,235
computer graphic artists are able...

42
00:03:07,278 --> 00:03:10,280
to bring some of these alien faces to life.

43
00:03:17,788 --> 00:03:21,875
And to come face to face with these extraterrestrial creations...

44
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:25,337
we will embark on a fantasy safari...

45
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:28,131
through the unexplored reaches of the universe...

46
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,676
like a tourist in an intergalactic zoo.

47
00:03:34,805 --> 00:03:39,434
Our first stop, the theoretical planet Eronel.

48
00:03:46,442 --> 00:03:49,027
The planet Eronel is an odd planet.

49
00:03:50,821 --> 00:03:54,824
First of all, it doesn't circle around a star like our Sun.

50
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:57,661
It circles around a little red dwarf.

51
00:03:57,703 --> 00:03:59,162
These are tiny stars.

52
00:04:00,122 --> 00:04:04,000
They're sometimes a fifth, a sixth the size of our Sun.

53
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:08,380
So the habitable zone is going to be much closer to that star.

54
00:04:11,717 --> 00:04:14,678
This habitable zone is a crucial piece of the puzzle...

55
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,640
when understanding the evolution of life on any alien planet.

56
00:04:21,644 --> 00:04:26,189
A habitable zone in a solar system is the distance from the star...

57
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:29,943
where water can exist as a liquid on the surface.

58
00:04:29,986 --> 00:04:32,445
It gets enough heat energy from the star...

59
00:04:32,488 --> 00:04:35,156
to have liquid water and stay liquid water.

60
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:40,036
Liquid water is one of the basic elements for life to begin.

61
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,834
But on Eronel, the habitable zone...

62
00:04:45,876 --> 00:04:49,045
is so close to this glowing ball of burning gas...

63
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:52,966
the star's gravity causes Eronel to be tidally locked...

64
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:54,467
much like Earth's Moon...

65
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:58,847
as we only see one side of the lunar surface at all times.

66
00:05:01,183 --> 00:05:04,769
This would mean that half of Eronel is constantly in daylight...

67
00:05:04,812 --> 00:05:07,939
and the other half is constantly in darkness.

68
00:05:09,525 --> 00:05:13,236
In the middle, there would be a 200-mile-wide area...

69
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:16,656
that stretches from the north pole to the south pole...

70
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:19,659
which is in a constant state of twilight.

71
00:05:19,702 --> 00:05:21,703
So it makes you wonder...

72
00:05:21,746 --> 00:05:23,997
where would we find life on this planet?

73
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:27,751
Well, truthfully, you're going to find it everywhere.

74
00:05:28,377 --> 00:05:30,170
But if it's on the dark side...

75
00:05:30,212 --> 00:05:33,381
it's life that's been adapted for living in the dark.

76
00:05:33,424 --> 00:05:35,133
And if it's on the bright side...

77
00:05:35,176 --> 00:05:39,262
it's life that's been adapted for living only in the bright side.

78
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:41,473
And in this twilight zone area...

79
00:05:41,515 --> 00:05:45,101
you're going to find creatures that are adapted for both.

80
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:48,980
They can wander and stray into both sides on this world.

81
00:05:49,023 --> 00:05:51,691
They really control their own destinies...

82
00:05:51,734 --> 00:05:54,444
in where they want to go and where they want to hunt.

83
00:05:56,614 --> 00:05:59,282
On Eronel, you're going to have a photosynthetic organism...

84
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:01,201
probably, likely in the marine environment...

85
00:06:01,243 --> 00:06:02,744
a red alga or a bacteria...

86
00:06:02,787 --> 00:06:05,622
that will be adapted to taking in infrared light...

87
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:09,250
and taking what energy it can out of that and making food.

88
00:06:09,293 --> 00:06:12,545
On land, it would probably be a lichen-like thing because it's cold--

89
00:06:12,588 --> 00:06:14,464
mosses that would be adapted that way.

90
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:16,925
You're going to have organisms that are going to feed off those.

91
00:06:19,053 --> 00:06:24,307
This algae on Eronel represents the bottom of a very long food chain.

92
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,102
Everything plays a vital role for survival...

93
00:06:27,144 --> 00:06:30,939
from the plant life to the larger, more complex creatures.

94
00:06:31,982 --> 00:06:35,777
One example on Eronel that uses this algae as a food source...

95
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,488
is the insect known as an achom.

96
00:06:40,825 --> 00:06:43,618
The achoms are a bizarre little creature.

97
00:06:46,455 --> 00:06:49,207
On Earth, we know of what we call metamorphosis.

98
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:53,712
It's the odd ability of a creature to change from one shape to another.

99
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,831
We see it in butterflies.

100
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,750
A caterpillar, eating in your garden...

101
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:01,836
will climb up on the fence, spin a cocoon...

102
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,547
months later, hatch out into a butterfly.

103
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:08,385
These do that, too, but they do it in a very odd way.

104
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:09,594
They look almost eel-like...

105
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:13,181
with two sets of fins that stick out on either side.

106
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:15,266
At some peculiar moment...

107
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:19,062
they move over to some of the plant life lock themselves in...

108
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:22,107
and attach themselves and form a shell around them.

109
00:07:23,275 --> 00:07:25,610
When that shell splits...

110
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:28,905
out comes something that we've never seen before.

111
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,824
Taking the hydrogen from the water...

112
00:07:30,866 --> 00:07:33,243
splitting the hydrogen from the oxygen...

113
00:07:33,285 --> 00:07:35,036
it inflates a little bubble...

114
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:37,872
and they lift right out of the water...

115
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:42,419
the breezes picking them up, carrying them to high altitudes...

116
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:44,421
spreading them out over the planet...

117
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:47,382
towards the twilight zones as the breezes move.

118
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:50,093
And they're almost like parachutists coming back down.

119
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,764
Once the achoms reach the ground...

120
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:58,435
they immediately create a burrow, where they primarily live.

121
00:07:58,477 --> 00:08:01,479
But as the achoms scavenge through the dirt for food...

122
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:06,401
they are hunted from above by one of the next links in the food chain...

123
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,698
the peena-pod.

124
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:15,869
Now, one of the creatures that we'd find most interesting on this world is the peena-pod.

125
00:08:16,912 --> 00:08:18,079
It's an odd little creature...

126
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,832
because its eyes wrap all the way around...

127
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,168
so it can see any movement behind it.

128
00:08:24,211 --> 00:08:26,337
In the twilight zone of Eronel...

129
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,965
it is going to be very dark and cold...

130
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,468
due to the low light of its star...

131
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,970
and the hunters, or even the hunted...

132
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,389
will have developed large eyes like owls...

133
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:38,808
or other nocturnal creatures here on Earth.

134
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,313
But there is an interesting adaptation...

135
00:08:43,355 --> 00:08:45,940
that developed in most creatures on Eronel.

136
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:50,153
Eronel orbits an M star.

137
00:08:50,046 --> 00:08:53,506
M stars emit most of their light in infrared.

138
00:08:54,717 --> 00:08:57,302
Infrared is the light that--

139
00:08:57,345 --> 00:09:01,306
It's actually heat that you feel when you open up the oven.

140
00:09:01,349 --> 00:09:03,516
That's what these creatures would see.

141
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:08,188
They would see the heat expended by their bodies in the world around them.

142
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:11,399
It would look very different than it does to you or me.

143
00:09:11,442 --> 00:09:14,736
To see heat signatures on the dark side of the planet...

144
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:17,739
gives one of the biggest links on the food chain of Eronel...

145
00:09:19,408 --> 00:09:22,160
the courga, a cunning advantage.

146
00:09:25,623 --> 00:09:28,792
In their sense, in their moves, in the way they act together...

147
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:32,003
they resemble jackals in the plains of Africa.

148
00:09:32,046 --> 00:09:33,129
They move in herds.

149
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:34,506
They're hunters. They're predators.

150
00:09:37,927 --> 00:09:39,511
Ugly little, nasty creatures...

151
00:09:39,553 --> 00:09:42,389
that will surround a peena-pod or a colony of them...

152
00:09:42,431 --> 00:09:44,808
ferret them out, and that's their meal.

153
00:09:46,644 --> 00:09:49,187
They have the odd ability, however...

154
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,272
to see not only in the twilight regions...

155
00:09:51,315 --> 00:09:53,650
with eyes like we might normally have...

156
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:56,903
but they have a second set of smaller eyes right above...

157
00:09:56,946 --> 00:09:59,572
that, once they move into the darker regions...

158
00:09:59,615 --> 00:10:01,074
the nighttime side...

159
00:10:01,117 --> 00:10:05,036
they can now pick up the heat signatures of creatures in that area.

160
00:10:06,622 --> 00:10:11,418
These are only a few of the creatures that could live on a planet like Eronel...

161
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,669
but, at least for now...

162
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:16,172
they are simply a product of our imagination.

163
00:10:19,844 --> 00:10:21,219
In science, we can sit there...

164
00:10:21,262 --> 00:10:23,805
and we can imagine life elsewhere.

165
00:10:25,808 --> 00:10:30,520
But if we have examples, we have one data point, in fact...

166
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:31,896
and that's planet Earth.

167
00:10:33,816 --> 00:10:36,109
And so, if we can look at life on Earth...

168
00:10:36,152 --> 00:10:39,821
it provides us with an amazing wealth of information...

169
00:10:39,864 --> 00:10:43,450
that we can then take forward to look for life elsewhere.

170
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:49,664
We have a variety of ecosystems that we can study...

171
00:10:49,707 --> 00:10:52,041
and we can look at the challenges.

172
00:10:53,711 --> 00:10:57,464
What are in ecosystems? What challenges do living things face?

173
00:10:57,506 --> 00:11:02,260
And we can apply these principles to alien life.

174
00:11:02,303 --> 00:11:04,971
To understand how these principles can be applied...

175
00:11:05,806 --> 00:11:09,267
we must continue our intergalactic fantasy safari.

176
00:11:12,188 --> 00:11:13,980
We leave the surface of Eronel...

177
00:11:14,023 --> 00:11:18,443
and zip across the cosmos 322 light-years away...

178
00:11:19,487 --> 00:11:21,321
to a new solar system...

179
00:11:21,363 --> 00:11:25,325
and the theoretical planet AG-143.

180
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:34,167
AG-143 is bigger than the Earth, much bigger than the Earth.

181
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:38,838
It has a beautiful ring system that circles around it.

182
00:11:38,881 --> 00:11:43,218
But more importantly, it is a big, gigantic dry desert...

183
00:11:45,554 --> 00:11:49,724
with three times the gravitational field that we feel here on the Earth.

184
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:54,729
A human, weighing in at 175 pounds on Earth...

185
00:11:54,772 --> 00:11:57,732
would step off onto the surface of AG-143...

186
00:11:57,775 --> 00:12:00,985
to weigh about 525 pounds.

187
00:12:01,028 --> 00:12:04,113
Certainly, life would need to adapt.

188
00:12:05,407 --> 00:12:06,407
But how?

189
00:12:10,246 --> 00:12:13,915
David Aguilar of Harvard University's Center for Astrophysics...

190
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:19,337
believes the best way to envision the adaptations of complex alienðÞlife forms...

191
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,714
is by looking at the variety of creatures...

192
00:12:21,757 --> 00:12:26,094
that have evolved to inhabit the diverse ecosystems of our own world.

193
00:12:28,138 --> 00:12:29,806
We're here at the North Carolina Zoo...

194
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:33,184
because, of all the zoos in the country right now...

195
00:12:33,227 --> 00:12:35,019
this is very special.

196
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,231
It is large.

197
00:12:39,275 --> 00:12:40,275
It's big.

198
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:46,948
And the environments here duplicate the different environments we find on our planet.

199
00:12:48,075 --> 00:12:52,579
This here today is a marvelous example of the variety of life on our planet.

200
00:12:54,498 --> 00:12:58,167
And within this variety of life on Earth, Aguilar believes...

201
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,129
that creatures supporting an extremely heavy structure...

202
00:13:01,171 --> 00:13:07,468
become the perfect model for understanding evolution on AG-143.

203
00:13:07,511 --> 00:13:11,222
When we talk about an animal adapted for a heavy-world environment...

204
00:13:11,265 --> 00:13:13,808
a world with more gravity, this is it.

205
00:13:13,851 --> 00:13:15,059
Look at what we have out here...

206
00:13:15,102 --> 00:13:18,771
the prototype legs that can suspend a huge body.

207
00:13:18,814 --> 00:13:20,565
Of course, we would have to move him down...

208
00:13:20,608 --> 00:13:22,483
move him closer to the ground.

209
00:13:22,526 --> 00:13:24,319
But this is perfect what we would see:

210
00:13:24,361 --> 00:13:27,447
Shorter, squattier, but heavy like this...

211
00:13:27,489 --> 00:13:30,950
adapted to a planet with much stronger gravity.

212
00:13:34,121 --> 00:13:40,585
Although life forms on AG-143 have certain comparable characteristics to creatures on Earth...

213
00:13:40,628 --> 00:13:44,964
their alien faces are beyond anything found on our planet.

214
00:13:55,851 --> 00:13:57,977
Everything looks good from here.

215
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,228
Okay. We copy that.

216
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:00,772
Sounds good.

217
00:14:00,814 --> 00:14:02,815
We wish we were with you.

218
00:14:05,569 --> 00:14:09,072
What if, one day, a deep space probe...

219
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:12,367
detects life outside our solar system?

220
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,791
What would an alien look like?

221
00:14:21,377 --> 00:14:24,045
To better understand these otherworldly creatures...

222
00:14:24,088 --> 00:14:26,089
and how they might have evolved...

223
00:14:27,007 --> 00:14:29,258
scientists believe you must first understand...

224
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:34,097
a few simple concepts about the physical environments where life might begin.

225
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:39,394
When looking at planets around distant stars...

226
00:14:39,436 --> 00:14:44,232
there are two factors that we scientists zero in on.

227
00:14:44,274 --> 00:14:47,694
First is distance to the mother star.

228
00:14:47,736 --> 00:14:50,238
That determines how much energy you have...

229
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,074
and whether or not you have liquid water.

230
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,494
Second, the mass...

231
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,998
the size of the planet.

232
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,709
That determines gravity...

233
00:15:02,751 --> 00:15:05,420
and what kind of organisms you may have.

234
00:15:06,755 --> 00:15:09,048
When people think about evolutionary biology...

235
00:15:09,091 --> 00:15:12,260
we tend to think of the whole nature red in tooth and claw,

236
00:15:12,302 --> 00:15:17,223
the whole Darwinian competition among organisms and among species and so on...

237
00:15:17,266 --> 00:15:20,977
that we forget that it's the physical environment that really shapes life.

238
00:15:22,771 --> 00:15:26,524
What gravity you have what temperature, what pressure...

239
00:15:26,567 --> 00:15:31,112
what composition the atmosphere is if there is any atmosphere, and so on.

240
00:15:34,158 --> 00:15:37,744
The laws of physics don't change as you travel through the universe...

241
00:15:37,786 --> 00:15:41,622
so understanding how creatures evolved in our Earthly environment...

242
00:15:41,665 --> 00:15:43,416
has allowed scientists to imagine...

243
00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:46,794
what life forms might arise on other types of worlds...

244
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:51,174
like the theoretical planet AG-143.

245
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:58,598
AG-143 orbits a bright F-class star.

246
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:03,227
Only ten percent of this world is covered with surface water.

247
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,646
And pockets of this liquid H2O...

248
00:16:05,689 --> 00:16:08,357
collect under the sands from the sparse rainfall.

249
00:16:10,027 --> 00:16:13,946
The environment on AG-143 is hot, arid...

250
00:16:13,989 --> 00:16:16,449
and the sunshine extremely bright.

251
00:16:17,993 --> 00:16:21,913
Now, because the star is an F-class star, okay...

252
00:16:21,955 --> 00:16:23,122
which is brighter than the Sun...

253
00:16:23,165 --> 00:16:26,000
you're going to have a UV output, ultraviolet light output.

254
00:16:27,336 --> 00:16:28,711
So, the organisms there...

255
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:30,963
are going to have to somehow be shielded...

256
00:16:31,006 --> 00:16:34,383
either in the atmosphere or in their own coverings.

257
00:16:35,844 --> 00:16:38,638
These coverings may be in the form of thick shells...

258
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:43,226
or other exteriors that would absorb the harsh UV radiation.

259
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:45,311
But the creatures on AG-143...

260
00:16:45,354 --> 00:16:48,147
would also develop other physical characteristics...

261
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:50,191
that are unique to this world.

262
00:16:51,527 --> 00:16:52,819
It's really interesting to imagine...

263
00:16:52,861 --> 00:16:55,947
what life might be like on a planet with higher gravity.

264
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:01,494
Well, from a microbe's point of view...

265
00:17:01,537 --> 00:17:04,122
there might not be a whole lot of difference.

266
00:17:04,164 --> 00:17:06,290
Where the differences would start to come...

267
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:09,460
is when you go out and land, for example...

268
00:17:09,503 --> 00:17:13,548
and there you have to worry about standing up.

269
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:16,717
Oh, darn gravity, you know, I just--

270
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,686
I just can't pull myself up.

271
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,932
But another byproduct of strong gravity...

272
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:28,896
may also give rise to an unlikely cast of characters on the surface of AG-143...

273
00:17:30,274 --> 00:17:33,234
or rather, slightly above the surface.

274
00:17:36,405 --> 00:17:40,032
On Earth, our atmosphere is 79 percent nitrogen...

275
00:17:40,075 --> 00:17:43,870
twenty percent oxygen, and one percent other gases...

276
00:17:43,912 --> 00:17:47,748
that is held in place due to the gravitational pull of the Earth.

277
00:17:50,085 --> 00:17:52,420
But on a planet like AG-143...

278
00:17:52,462 --> 00:17:55,965
the stronger gravity would hold a much thicker atmosphere...

279
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:58,009
perfect for achieving flight.

280
00:17:59,115 --> 00:18:01,847
It may also hold a much higher level of oxygen.

281
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:06,225
We went through a period a couple of hundred million years ago...

282
00:18:06,268 --> 00:18:11,230
where we think the Earth had a higher concentration of oxygen for a while.

283
00:18:11,273 --> 00:18:13,524
And what we see in the fossil record...

284
00:18:13,567 --> 00:18:19,071
is giant insects, huge wings, giant flying organisms.

285
00:18:19,114 --> 00:18:20,281
Because if you think about it...

286
00:18:20,324 --> 00:18:22,575
you have more oxygen for metabolism...

287
00:18:22,618 --> 00:18:24,744
so you can do things with more energy.

288
00:18:24,786 --> 00:18:29,040
It's like taking in higher oxygen with an oxygen tank or something.

289
00:18:29,082 --> 00:18:30,541
You feel all pumped up...

290
00:18:30,584 --> 00:18:33,377
and that's how these organisms must have felt.

291
00:18:35,464 --> 00:18:39,175
With a thicker atmosphere and higher concentration of oxygen...

292
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:43,888
the skies of AG-143 would be full of large flying creatures...

293
00:18:43,931 --> 00:18:47,308
that could stay airborne for as long as they need.

294
00:18:49,478 --> 00:18:51,562
One example could be the sargan.

295
00:18:52,606 --> 00:18:54,690
This creature would live most of its life...

296
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:59,695
soaring through the atmosphere, looking for pockets of water that scarcely pepper the planet.

297
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:03,532
Once the sargan finds a watering hole...

298
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:06,494
they swoop down in hopes to not only drink...

299
00:19:06,536 --> 00:19:10,706
but hunt any creatures that may have found their way to the oasis...

300
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:14,126
a creature like the moblant.

301
00:19:14,169 --> 00:19:19,423
At first sight, you might almost mistake a moblant for a starfish.

302
00:19:19,466 --> 00:19:22,843
It has stubby little arms that it moves across the desert.

303
00:19:22,886 --> 00:19:24,637
But the odd thing about these arms...

304
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,473
is they have long tentacles that probe the sand...

305
00:19:27,516 --> 00:19:30,351
for pockets of precious water that may be hidden.

306
00:19:30,394 --> 00:19:32,270
And the odd thing about this creature...

307
00:19:32,312 --> 00:19:35,648
is if it finds a large, large pocket of water...

308
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:41,862
it begins pulling the water up like it's pulling it up a well...

309
00:19:41,905 --> 00:19:44,740
and it grows in size, and it grows in size...

310
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:47,785
and stores the water up like a camel does.

311
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:54,375
Adaptations to locate and store water are crucial for survival.

312
00:19:55,544 --> 00:19:57,837
To be stuck out in the middle of a desert...

313
00:19:57,879 --> 00:20:01,465
hundreds of miles from anything resembling a liquid...

314
00:20:01,508 --> 00:20:04,885
would be a death sentence for almost any Earth creature.

315
00:20:08,598 --> 00:20:12,852
The same would be true for life on our theoretical planet AG-143.

316
00:20:15,105 --> 00:20:18,774
This is why the pholis lives primarily near the water deposits...

317
00:20:19,693 --> 00:20:23,029
so that it will remain close to this precious commodity.

318
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:30,411
One of the most bizarre creatures on AG-143 is the pholis.

319
00:20:30,454 --> 00:20:32,121
They're short, squatty.

320
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:35,416
It's a mouth supported by three legs...

321
00:20:35,459 --> 00:20:39,420
on a pedestal platform that has scales underneath.

322
00:20:39,463 --> 00:20:43,591
It glides across tðÞe sand almost like a sidewinder as it moves.

323
00:20:43,633 --> 00:20:46,469
It has the uncanny ability to sense chemically...

324
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:48,512
whether or not its prey is nearby.

325
00:20:50,432 --> 00:20:54,810
It hunts around the edges of streams and small, little lakes.

326
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:59,315
And if it finds its prey, it suddenly stops, freezes...

327
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:04,028
and camouflages itself so that it almost becomes invisible, waiting...

328
00:21:06,281 --> 00:21:08,491
until a hapless creature moves...

329
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:10,701
and then, suddenly, out it snaps.

330
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:14,914
It's found its dinner.

331
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:20,211
And the pholis' method of movement...

332
00:21:20,253 --> 00:21:23,589
gliding across the surface like a snake on grass...

333
00:21:23,632 --> 00:21:25,841
is another evolutionary characteristic...

334
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:28,552
caused by the stronger gravity of the planet.

335
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:33,140
To slide with scales, rather than lifting a leg...

336
00:21:33,183 --> 00:21:35,851
would be a lot easier for any creature.

337
00:21:37,521 --> 00:21:41,816
That, and it offers a quiet advantage over its prey.

338
00:21:41,858 --> 00:21:44,276
They may never hear the pholis coming.

339
00:21:46,488 --> 00:21:51,826
But as the food chain goes on AG-143,nothing is safe.

340
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:59,792
For lurking in these pools of water lies a silent but deadly creature...

341
00:21:59,835 --> 00:22:01,877
known as the heathor.

342
00:22:03,171 --> 00:22:07,133
As we end our examination of the food chain on AG-143...

343
00:22:08,176 --> 00:22:09,927
we've seen the extreme challenges...

344
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:12,763
that creatures on a world with little surface water...

345
00:22:12,806 --> 00:22:15,391
and higher gravity must overcome.

346
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:20,771
But what if the planetary conditions were reversed?

347
00:22:20,814 --> 00:22:23,941
What if a planet had a suitable amount of water for life...

348
00:22:25,026 --> 00:22:28,571
but also a much weaker gravitational force?

349
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:31,282
The answer might lie right above our heads...

350
00:22:31,324 --> 00:22:33,451
in the skies above the Earth.

351
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:39,498
On our intergalactic safari...

352
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:41,792
we've seen how leading astrobiologists...

353
00:22:41,835 --> 00:22:44,628
used present-day earth science to hypothesize...

354
00:22:44,671 --> 00:22:48,174
about the size, shape, and behavior of creatures...

355
00:22:48,216 --> 00:22:52,219
on an imaginary world with much stronger gravity than Earth.

356
00:22:57,392 --> 00:23:01,187
But what would happen if the gravity was much weaker?

357
00:23:01,229 --> 00:23:06,192
To find out, we lift off from the strong gravity of AG-143...

358
00:23:06,234 --> 00:23:12,406
to another planet 89 light-years away, GP-C 925.

359
00:23:14,743 --> 00:23:19,205
GP-C 925 is smaller than the Earth.

360
00:23:19,247 --> 00:23:21,373
It's about half the size of the Earth.

361
00:23:21,416 --> 00:23:24,585
It's borderline for an Earth-like planet.

362
00:23:24,628 --> 00:23:27,296
And because it's smaller, it has less gravity.

363
00:23:31,259 --> 00:23:34,136
The star that it circles around is cooler than our Sun.

364
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:39,016
And because of that, it's a cross between frozen ice patches...

365
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:41,894
green photosynthetic plants peeking through...

366
00:23:41,937 --> 00:23:44,021
and some bodies of water.

367
00:23:44,064 --> 00:23:46,941
It would look very much like the northern part of our planet...

368
00:23:46,983 --> 00:23:50,194
you get up towards the northern parts of Canada and Greenland.

369
00:23:50,237 --> 00:23:52,238
WðÞ call it the taiga areas.

370
00:23:55,116 --> 00:24:00,287
GP-C 925 would be a very specific type of environment.

371
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:02,248
You wouldn't find deserts on this world.

372
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:05,125
You'd find very few mountains, actually, on this world.

373
00:24:05,168 --> 00:24:08,087
It would be a world that was cooler...

374
00:24:08,129 --> 00:24:11,507
more preserved than what we see on our own planet...

375
00:24:12,801 --> 00:24:14,760
but beautiful just the same.

376
00:24:16,972 --> 00:24:18,722
This world, with much lower gravity...

377
00:24:18,765 --> 00:24:22,643
could generate much larger, more elegant life forms.

378
00:24:22,686 --> 00:24:23,769
Now, I'm 6' 6 ".

379
00:24:24,006 --> 00:24:27,365
Imagine how tall I could be if I had evolved in a world with a half or a third the gravity.

380
00:24:27,408 --> 00:24:29,409
Imagine what a redwood would look like...

381
00:24:29,451 --> 00:24:31,452
in a world with lower gravity.

382
00:24:36,491 --> 00:24:39,743
These types of gravitational effects on the surface life...

383
00:24:39,786 --> 00:24:43,163
would shape and model different characteristics.

384
00:24:43,206 --> 00:24:47,084
It would also appear that on a world like GP-C 925...

385
00:24:49,963 --> 00:24:54,174
much of that surface life would not be found on the surface at all.

386
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,225
Here we are in the aviary.

387
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:07,605
Up in these trees are the remnants of the dinosaurs.

388
00:25:07,647 --> 00:25:10,733
This was what was left behind when the dinosaurs passed on.

389
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:13,485
These birds are meant to fly.

390
00:25:13,528 --> 00:25:17,489
Their bones are hollow, their feathers locked together.

391
00:25:17,532 --> 00:25:20,117
These birds were meant to rule the skies.

392
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:24,496
But on a low-gravity planet...

393
00:25:24,539 --> 00:25:28,125
this is what you would see that would rule the planet.

394
00:25:30,211 --> 00:25:33,172
Because gravity is going to be light, flight is going to be very easy.

395
00:25:35,592 --> 00:25:40,554
And flight is something that's been done on Earth by a number of organisms in different ways.

396
00:25:40,597 --> 00:25:43,390
Bats stretch membranes between their fingers...

397
00:25:43,433 --> 00:25:46,018
and create wings to fly.

398
00:25:46,061 --> 00:25:48,687
Flying squirrels put flaps out of their fur...

399
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:50,356
and glide that way.

400
00:25:52,233 --> 00:25:54,985
But not everything on GP-C 925...

401
00:25:55,028 --> 00:25:57,029
is comparable to creatures on Earth.

402
00:26:00,241 --> 00:26:04,244
The strangest of the airborne creatures one could imagine...

403
00:26:04,287 --> 00:26:06,163
are the lollygars.

404
00:26:06,206 --> 00:26:11,418
Imagine floating sacs that almost look like inflated lungs...

405
00:26:13,088 --> 00:26:17,216
with long, long, long tentacles hanging down...

406
00:26:17,258 --> 00:26:22,638
that drape along the countryside as they slowly move and float over the scenery.

407
00:26:23,264 --> 00:26:28,352
Heated by internal heat inside, the warm air inflates their sacs.

408
00:26:28,395 --> 00:26:31,397
They almost look like jellyfish, floating through the air.

409
00:26:32,482 --> 00:26:39,029
And like jellyfish, they sting and grab anything that scurries over the ground in front of them.

410
00:26:39,072 --> 00:26:41,824
To see them moving, bobbing up and down in the wind...

411
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:45,828
like a herd of psychedelic jellyfish...

412
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:48,372
is something beyond what we can imagine.

413
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:51,583
And yet hðÞre, it's quite common.

414
00:26:54,421 --> 00:26:55,671
Even life on the ground...

415
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:59,216
would push the limits of science as we know it.

416
00:26:59,259 --> 00:27:03,512
When we take a look at this world, think of the swaystacks.

417
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:05,931
They look like they're long stalks...

418
00:27:05,974 --> 00:27:09,643
that extend 15,20,30 feet into the air...

419
00:27:09,686 --> 00:27:12,771
numerous ones coming up with a bulb on the end.

420
00:27:12,814 --> 00:27:14,773
They sway in the wind.

421
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:17,735
But what's amazing is these aren't plants.

422
00:27:17,777 --> 00:27:22,072
These are animals with roots that pick up and slowly move...

423
00:27:22,115 --> 00:27:27,661
across the planet surface and anchor themselves back down swaying in the wind...

424
00:27:27,704 --> 00:27:30,789
where they wait for any creature that happens by.

425
00:27:32,459 --> 00:27:35,586
As a creature moves by, the top of them, like little Frisbees...

426
00:27:35,628 --> 00:27:38,213
shoot off and wedge into the side of the creature...

427
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:41,842
into their leg, into their carapace, into their hair...

428
00:27:41,885 --> 00:27:43,761
stuck for the moment.

429
00:27:43,803 --> 00:27:47,806
As they move on, they reach a new area, they drop off...

430
00:27:47,849 --> 00:27:50,309
and they begin growing all over again.

431
00:27:50,351 --> 00:27:52,227
They're simply spreading their seeds...

432
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:55,147
with these tiny little disks flying through the air...

433
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:57,357
once they sense something moving by.

434
00:27:59,694 --> 00:28:02,446
On this planet, we see similar things...

435
00:28:02,489 --> 00:28:05,491
with the plants and the weeds that grow here...

436
00:28:05,533 --> 00:28:07,493
but nothing to this size and extent...

437
00:28:07,535 --> 00:28:10,788
and the idea that we begin crossing plants...

438
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:15,083
that look like animals and animals that look like plants--

439
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:18,212
this is a bizarre world indeed.

440
00:28:18,254 --> 00:28:21,507
Creatures like the swaystacks and the lollygars...

441
00:28:21,549 --> 00:28:25,886
would enjoy an adequate amount of water on GP-C 925.

442
00:28:27,597 --> 00:28:29,181
But what would happen on a world...

443
00:28:29,224 --> 00:28:36,313
where there was even more water a lot more?

444
00:28:36,356 --> 00:28:40,526
Specifically, a planet with no land whatsoever...

445
00:28:40,568 --> 00:28:42,444
a water world?

446
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:00,796
Since we embarked on our intergalactic safari...

447
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:05,717
we have seen the amazing lifecycle of the achom on Eronel...

448
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,513
the bizarre-looking pholis on AG-143...

449
00:29:09,556 --> 00:29:13,308
and the floating lollygars of GP-C 925.

450
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:19,356
All of these theoretical life forms on these imaginary worlds...

451
00:29:19,399 --> 00:29:24,736
have been created by scientists, based on knowledge about the development of life on Earth.

452
00:29:27,782 --> 00:29:30,284
But how would these creatures have gotten their start...

453
00:29:30,326 --> 00:29:33,120
on these strange, far-flung planets?

454
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:38,584
The requirements that we know have to be there for life...

455
00:29:38,626 --> 00:29:41,211
is based on the life that we know...

456
00:29:41,254 --> 00:29:46,091
and the chemistry that we think leads to the origin and evolution of life...

457
00:29:46,134 --> 00:29:50,053
is carbon chemistry in aqueous or water solution.

458
00:29:53,641 --> 00:29:55,183
and we need nitrogen.

459
00:29:56,644 --> 00:29:59,021
And you need some sort of energy...

460
00:30:01,316 --> 00:30:04,151
'cause life, even microbes, needs food.

461
00:30:04,193 --> 00:30:06,069
They've got to have some sort of metabolism...

462
00:30:06,112 --> 00:30:08,113
so you need some source of energy.

463
00:30:08,156 --> 00:30:09,448
Sunlight works pretty well...

464
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:11,867
but it isn't the only source of energy, even on Earth.

465
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:25,464
For hundreds of years, scientists believed that sunlight was the only energy source for life.

466
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,221
But within the past few decades...

467
00:30:34,098 --> 00:30:36,350
new findings showed they were wrong.

468
00:30:42,315 --> 00:30:46,818
Boiling water temperatures found around hydrothermal vents on the seafloor...

469
00:30:46,861 --> 00:30:50,489
were once believed to be incompatible with life.

470
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:56,703
But, recently, scientists have discovered...

471
00:30:56,746 --> 00:31:03,126
the areas around these black smokers are perfectly suitable for a flourishing underwater community.

472
00:31:09,509 --> 00:31:12,511
Instead of the Sun, these creatures take their energy...

473
00:31:12,553 --> 00:31:16,473
from the heat, gases, and minerals spewing from the vents.

474
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:22,521
These highly tenacious life forms are known as extremophiles.

475
00:31:22,563 --> 00:31:25,440
The existence of extremophiles broadens our aspects...

476
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:30,028
of what we think organisms can do and what we know organisms can do.

477
00:31:30,071 --> 00:31:33,532
In other words, if you look at all of the different kinds of environments...

478
00:31:33,574 --> 00:31:35,033
that we find here on Earth...

479
00:31:35,076 --> 00:31:37,869
it ranges from extremely cold to extremely hot...

480
00:31:37,912 --> 00:31:42,541
to acid, to alkaline just about anything you can think of.

481
00:31:42,583 --> 00:31:45,127
And just about everywhere, you find life.

482
00:31:46,254 --> 00:31:49,131
The fact that life is found at all on Earth...

483
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:53,301
is due in large part to our position in the solar system.

484
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:55,220
We scientists used to believe...

485
00:31:55,263 --> 00:31:57,889
that in order to get life off the ground on a planet...

486
00:31:57,932 --> 00:32:01,226
it has to be in the Goldilocks zone of the Sun...

487
00:32:02,311 --> 00:32:04,771
not too close because water will boil...

488
00:32:04,814 --> 00:32:07,399
not too far because water will freeze...

489
00:32:07,442 --> 00:32:10,694
but just right to have a liquid ocean...

490
00:32:10,737 --> 00:32:13,321
out of which DNA can form.

491
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:16,408
Well, that picture we now know is wrong.

492
00:32:16,451 --> 00:32:21,246
We now believe that even on icy moons of planets like Jupiter...

493
00:32:21,289 --> 00:32:24,291
it is possible to get life off the ground.

494
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:28,837
Europa is a moon of Jupiter.

495
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,213
It's covered in ice.

496
00:32:31,007 --> 00:32:36,178
But beneath the ice, there is apparently a gigantic ocean...

497
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:40,807
perhaps stable for billions of years, containing liquid water.

498
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:49,024
And so that sent the physicists and so on scrambling.

499
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:52,843
How could you end up with liquid water so far away from the Sun?

500
00:32:53,321 --> 00:32:56,573
Now, what it turns out, the idea is...

501
00:32:56,616 --> 00:32:58,950
is that there's something called tidal flexing.

502
00:33:00,828 --> 00:33:04,372
For Europa, tidal flexing is caused by the immense size...

503
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:06,792
and gravitational pull of Jupiter...

504
00:33:06,834 --> 00:33:11,880
which causes the ice on the moon to pull and stretch, generating heat.

505
00:33:15,301 --> 00:33:18,136
Once the insulated lower layers get warm enough...

506
00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:21,139
the ice will melt, creating oceans.

507
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:27,896
Now add the types of organic compounds that are believed to exist on Europa...

508
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:32,484
and you've got a slightly altered, but very realistic recipe for life.

509
00:33:35,071 --> 00:33:38,740
This brings us to our next stop in our intergalactic safari.

510
00:33:43,371 --> 00:33:47,666
As we leave the busy skies of GP-C 925 behind...

511
00:33:47,708 --> 00:33:49,793
we can travel 72 light-years...

512
00:33:49,836 --> 00:33:53,713
to a theoretical gas giant known as Yeneer g...

513
00:33:55,258 --> 00:33:58,051
a planet circled by eight moons.

514
00:33:59,178 --> 00:34:01,805
Normally, we wouldn't bother with Yeneer g.

515
00:34:01,848 --> 00:34:03,098
lt's a gas giant...

516
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:06,101
and we don't think life could exist on these worlds.

517
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:10,856
The world we're interested in is the moon Aner'bas.

518
00:34:10,898 --> 00:34:14,192
It's about twice the size of Mercury.

519
00:34:14,235 --> 00:34:18,738
It's a world very similar to the moon Europa that circles around Jupiter.

520
00:34:20,408 --> 00:34:24,035
Imagine a planet covered with oceans...

521
00:34:24,078 --> 00:34:26,788
and on the surface, ice, a lot of ice...

522
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:29,207
that locks everything inside.

523
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:32,002
There's no ground to walk on this planet.

524
00:34:32,044 --> 00:34:35,380
But inside these oceans, they could be teeming with life.

525
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,472
And with the constant pull by Yeneer g...

526
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:48,935
Aner'bas would most likely have a large amount of geothermal activity...

527
00:34:48,978 --> 00:34:52,480
that could be a prime source of energy for life to begin.

528
00:34:58,613 --> 00:35:01,907
Near the surface on Aner'bas, small amounts of light...

529
00:35:01,949 --> 00:35:05,952
may bleed through the thinner areas of ice to the water below.

530
00:35:07,455 --> 00:35:10,457
Here some creatures may have evolved eyes.

531
00:35:10,499 --> 00:35:12,542
This may provide them with advantages...

532
00:35:12,585 --> 00:35:16,213
but would also make them vulnerable to certain defense techniques.

533
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:22,427
One example of a cunning underwater escape artist is the amabos.

534
00:35:24,805 --> 00:35:27,349
To us, light is just light.

535
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:29,476
But think of the amabos.

536
00:35:29,518 --> 00:35:32,771
A small, little, almost gelatinous-looking creature...

537
00:35:32,813 --> 00:35:36,233
that swims through the water, innocent.

538
00:35:36,275 --> 00:35:38,735
If anything comes close to it that threatens it...

539
00:35:38,778 --> 00:35:44,532
it throws out a brilliant flash of sparkling lights all around it...

540
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:47,577
blinding whatever creature came up to it.

541
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,788
And in that moment, it's gone...

542
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:52,457
much like a squid might shoot out a big ink cloud...

543
00:35:53,834 --> 00:35:56,253
It is suddenly masked by brilliant lights...

544
00:35:56,295 --> 00:35:58,380
that almost look like the Fourth of July.

545
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:02,008
And it's gone.

546
00:36:02,802 --> 00:36:06,680
Light, in that sense, is a protective mechanism.

547
00:36:09,725 --> 00:36:12,519
But creatures that live much deeper in the oceans...

548
00:36:12,561 --> 00:36:14,562
would adapt other methods for survival.

549
00:36:16,524 --> 00:36:19,317
One example is the zowalina.

550
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:27,075
The zowalina look like a cross between a weird, weird spider and a very strange crab.

551
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:33,373
But they have an odd, odd ability.

552
00:36:33,416 --> 00:36:35,375
They don't sense their world through eyes.

553
00:36:36,085 --> 00:36:38,211
They don't sense their world through ears.

554
00:36:39,338 --> 00:36:42,424
They sense their world through an electric field...

555
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:44,467
that they generate around their bodies.

556
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:47,512
This field can be stretched out...

557
00:36:47,555 --> 00:36:50,724
so that it senses everything that's moving around it.

558
00:36:50,766 --> 00:36:56,521
It sees its world by what impinges on this electronic field.

559
00:36:56,564 --> 00:36:58,773
And the interesting thing about it is...

560
00:36:58,816 --> 00:37:03,194
once they've locked onto something that they think is prey...

561
00:37:03,237 --> 00:37:06,990
they wait till it draws nearer and nearer...

562
00:37:07,033 --> 00:37:09,200
and all of a sudden--zap.

563
00:37:15,041 --> 00:37:20,045
A huge bolt of electricityjets out, stuns their prey...

564
00:37:20,087 --> 00:37:23,423
and a tentacle whips out and grabs it and pulls it right in.

565
00:37:23,466 --> 00:37:26,176
It hunts by using electricity.

566
00:37:28,387 --> 00:37:34,059
As we see the immense challenges that creatures like this would have to overcome in a water world...

567
00:37:34,101 --> 00:37:36,770
there is one last factor yet to explore.

568
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:45,487
When the time comes that the people of Earth discover life in the cosmos...

569
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:49,741
or that life finally decides to reveal itself to the human race...

570
00:37:49,784 --> 00:37:52,786
it may not be a biological entity at all.

571
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:56,414
Rather than flesh, blood, and carbon...

572
00:37:56,457 --> 00:37:59,626
we might be met with steel and silicon...

573
00:38:00,836 --> 00:38:01,836
a machine.

574
00:38:12,306 --> 00:38:17,060
As we approach the theoretical planet Gaia' Leo, our final stop...

575
00:38:17,103 --> 00:38:20,814
we notice three extremely large craters on the surface.

576
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:27,362
An asteroid collision with a life-supporting planet would be catastrophic.

577
00:38:30,157 --> 00:38:32,867
But on Gaia' Leo, something's different.

578
00:38:37,832 --> 00:38:39,541
We approach the surface...

579
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:43,044
and see tiny mechanical creatures roaming around.

580
00:38:44,797 --> 00:38:46,297
Although our journey thus far...

581
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:49,134
has explored an imaginary edge of the universe...

582
00:38:49,176 --> 00:38:52,846
filled with biological creatures of all shapes and sizes...

583
00:38:54,223 --> 00:38:56,307
some scientists believe an alien world...

584
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:59,394
could instead be a land of synthetic machines...

585
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:01,312
much like Gaia' Leo.

586
00:39:09,655 --> 00:39:14,951
Dr. Seth Shostak of the Search for Extraterrestrial IntðÞlligence or SETI Institute...

587
00:39:14,994 --> 00:39:18,538
believes that when life beyond Earth is discovered...

588
00:39:18,581 --> 00:39:21,583
our cosmic relative may be made of steel and silicon...

589
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:23,418
rather than flesh and blood.

590
00:39:27,423 --> 00:39:29,382
Any aliens that have gotten clever enough...

591
00:39:29,425 --> 00:39:32,343
to build a radio transmitter and get on the air...

592
00:39:32,386 --> 00:39:33,928
so that we could hear them...

593
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:36,556
have probably gone the next step...

594
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:41,186
and the next step might be the development of thinking machines.

595
00:39:43,189 --> 00:39:48,651
To better understand the origin of an alien planet teeming with these types of machines...

596
00:39:48,694 --> 00:39:54,782
scientists say we only have to look as far as our own evolution of intelligence here on Earth...

597
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:57,702
specifically artificial intelligence.

598
00:39:58,704 --> 00:40:00,914
Artificial intelligence, you might say...

599
00:40:00,956 --> 00:40:03,166
is the science of making babies from scratch...

600
00:40:03,209 --> 00:40:04,876
instead of the old-fashioned way.

601
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:10,798
It's the science and engineering that tries to put together a mind...

602
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:12,842
by understanding how the mind works.

603
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:17,222
Now, we haven't done that.

604
00:40:17,264 --> 00:40:19,516
We haven't built thinking machines...

605
00:40:19,558 --> 00:40:21,059
but people who work in that area...

606
00:40:21,101 --> 00:40:25,980
seem to think that that's likely to happen within 20 years, 50 years, 100 years.

607
00:40:27,733 --> 00:40:32,570
It's conceivable that hundreds perhaps thousands of years into the future...

608
00:40:32,613 --> 00:40:35,990
we may want to merge with our machines.

609
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:38,743
Realize that in the coming centuries...

610
00:40:38,786 --> 00:40:41,120
machines could actually become smarter than us...

611
00:40:43,457 --> 00:40:44,832
and there's always the danger...

612
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:48,044
that our creations will put us in zoos, behind bars...

613
00:40:48,087 --> 00:40:51,756
and throw peanuts at us, and make us dance...

614
00:40:51,799 --> 00:40:54,592
just like we make bears dance at zoos.

615
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:59,389
But instead of merging with the machines...

616
00:41:01,475 --> 00:41:05,353
one day humans may, in fact, become the machines.

617
00:41:08,482 --> 00:41:11,901
And once the CPU surpasses the human brain...

618
00:41:11,944 --> 00:41:14,612
sophisticated software could give these beings...

619
00:41:14,655 --> 00:41:17,073
an unparalleled advantage over us.

620
00:41:17,783 --> 00:41:20,201
If you've got artificial intelligences...

621
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:22,954
running on brains a million times faster than human...

622
00:41:22,997 --> 00:41:25,248
and thinking a million times fast as human...

623
00:41:25,291 --> 00:41:30,044
they can theoretically do 10,000 years worth of thinking in 3 1/2 days.

624
00:41:31,672 --> 00:41:36,175
Vast amounts of energy would be their lifeline to achieving such a feat.

625
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:41,598
Once they harvested Gaia' Leo for all usable resources...

626
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:46,019
these small robotic creatures, known as sevals...

627
00:41:46,061 --> 00:41:48,396
could build a planetary highway to space...

628
00:41:50,858 --> 00:41:53,318
then the next level of machines, the fishers...

629
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:57,989
would have access to virtually an unlimðÞted amount of energy for their survival.

630
00:42:01,869 --> 00:42:03,661
Just realize that the Earth only uses...

631
00:42:03,704 --> 00:42:07,373
a tiny fraction of the energy from the Sun.

632
00:42:08,876 --> 00:42:10,918
If the Sun were this big...

633
00:42:10,961 --> 00:42:17,175
the Earth would be nothing but a head of a pin compared to the size of the Sun...

634
00:42:17,217 --> 00:42:21,220
so we absorb only the tiniest fraction of energy from the Sun.

635
00:42:25,893 --> 00:42:28,186
To harvest the energy from the Sun...

636
00:42:28,228 --> 00:42:31,606
a theoretical structure known as a Dyson sphere...

637
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:34,400
could be built around it or any other star.

638
00:42:34,443 --> 00:42:37,403
A Dyson sphere is a gigantic sphere...

639
00:42:37,446 --> 00:42:39,864
that is built to surround a star...

640
00:42:39,907 --> 00:42:43,034
to absorb all the energy from that star.

641
00:42:45,412 --> 00:42:49,165
In this way, you can absorb the entire output of a star...

642
00:42:49,208 --> 00:42:51,209
without getting burned in the process.

643
00:42:53,796 --> 00:42:57,715
Once a star is dissected for parts and its energy is depleted...

644
00:42:57,758 --> 00:42:59,967
the fishers could dismantle the sphere...

645
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:04,013
and propel themselves towards the next galactic battery.

646
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:17,819
If scientists are correct...

647
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:22,990
this rise of the machines may even happen on a planet closer to home.

648
00:43:37,631 --> 00:43:39,590
As each year passes...

649
00:43:39,633 --> 00:43:44,262
new scientific findings are being made that push the envelope in understanding...

650
00:43:44,304 --> 00:43:47,807
not only ourselves, but life in the universe.

651
00:43:51,145 --> 00:43:54,689
There is a whole new world, or, rather, worlds...

652
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:57,692
ready for us to discover out there.

653
00:44:00,279 --> 00:44:04,282
And if life elsewhere in the universe is finally discovered...

654
00:44:04,324 --> 00:44:07,326
the sheer number of stars assures us...

655
00:44:07,369 --> 00:44:12,957
that there is a diverse, colorful, and vast array of life to be found...

656
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,901
and more alien faces than anyone could ever imagine.

657
00:44:17,584 --> 00:44:26,383
