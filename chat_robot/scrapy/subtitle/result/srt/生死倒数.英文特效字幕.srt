00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I understand, but the doctors will know where to find you. Okay?

32
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just before dawn Katrina heads north west straight for the coast.

33

39
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:51,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is a she. Did you know that?

40
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:53,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? Know what?

41
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have a baby girl.

42
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A girl?

43
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me show you where we're keeping her

44
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:03,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but do know that we'll need to monitor her for the next few days.

45
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The NICU is, is overcrowded

46
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so I've got her in a private room.

47
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:11,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. So, how's Abigail doing?

48
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:18,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We transfused all that we had. I want you to know that.

49
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:22,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Doctor Mendolson and I we did all we could, but...

50
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}her liver had given up.

51
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:28,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She bled out.

52
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.

53
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Okay, so...?

54

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mister Hayes.

55
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm really sorry.

56
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She expired at seven this morning.

57
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not Abby.

58
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

59
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I'm sorry. -Not my Abby. She's fine.

60
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell me she's fine.

61
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell me she's fine.

62
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I swear to God you better tell me she's fine right now.

63
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:06,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just tell me she's okay. Let's just, let's go see her. She's okay, right?

64
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mister Hayes, let...

65
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't touch me, though. I want you to tell me.

66
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just tell me she's okay.

67
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, Mister Hayes.

68
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:19,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, not sorry. I don't want sorry. I want...

69
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mister Haynes,

70

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}let me take you to see your daughter.

71
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

72
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here at the end.

73
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There she is.

74
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is this?

75
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is a ventilator.

76
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your daughter hasn't yet learned how to breathe on her own, so...

77
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}this is giving her a little help.

78
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:34,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now we got an I.V. drip to feed her nutrients and...

79
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}she'll be big and healthy before you know.

80
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have any questions?

81
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How's Abigail?

82
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:59,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I'm gonna give you something, It'll help you. -No. Listen to me.

83
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm okay. It was just a stupid question.

84
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's okay. It's alright.

85
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna have a nurse check on you.

86
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How long will this baby need the machine?

87
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:19,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your daughter? The best guess is... 48 hours.

88
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But it's still too early to tell.

89
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll know you're out of danger is when she starts crying.

90
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:27,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The first time she does it's always a good sound.

91
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I'll be back. -Alright. And, Doctor Edmonds...

92
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with this storm are you gonna be moving people out?

93
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a hurricane.

94
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:36,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, people are gonna tell you

95
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:39,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it's better at Charity, or Lindy Boggs.

96
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:43,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It won't be. Stay with your daughter, Mister Hayes. Okay?

97
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know you.

98
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm panicky. It's just going bad for me.

99
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I see a gun and I see this guy going for it,

100
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so I start wrestling with him the best that I can.

101
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mind you? This is all happening in the middle of the day,

102
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:30,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}right outside of the bank, in the parking lot. Sorry.

103
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-That's when I rob all my banks. -Hush.

104
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So the driver gets out of the car and he comes running over.

105
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Meanwhile I'm playing keep-away with the guy for the gun,

106
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-but the driver doesn't go for the gun. -He goes for the money.

107
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:41,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The duffel bag.

108
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So he grabs the duffel bag, the driver, and he runs back to the car.

109
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mean while Mr. pantyhose face is screaming...

110
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:50,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was, like, "Larry! Larry don't you dare!"

111
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. So, Larry, the getaway driver, hightails it out of there.

112
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's peeling out, he's just about to the street

113
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when this little car comes out of nowhere...

114
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-My car is not that little. -It's a little car.

115
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It got the job done, didn't it?

116
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wanna tell the story or should I finish?

117
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Anyway, I get out, I run over,

118
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:09,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I mace him as he's getting out of his car.

119
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, it was hairspray.

120
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no mace about it. That was hairspray.

121
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I blinded him and he couldn't run.

122
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I did my job. And the police got there shortly afterwards and...

123
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-we saved the day... Yeah. -Yeah.

124
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-That's how we met. -Yeah.

125
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh my god you two.

126
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:27,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You're like an old married couple. -I worry about your kids.

127
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:31,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Oh, we're not having kids. -No, we're not married.

128
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Abby.

129
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't want the baby now.

130
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want you back.

131
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want you.

132
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please...

133
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:33,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sir?

134
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't be back here.

135
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's my wife.

136
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's my wife

137
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry. But this area is off limits.

138
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:51,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, she shouldn't be on the floor like this.

139
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're running short on staff today, there's a backlog.

140
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:57,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, whatever, let's get a body bag or something,

141
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we'll put her in a body bag...

142
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There really isn't anywhere else for her to go.

143
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:03,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It will only take a minute. Let's just get her on some higher ground please.

144
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, get her feet.

145
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

146
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

147
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean that.

148
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's okay.

149
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry for your loss.

150
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How did she die?

151
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Giving birth to our daughter.

152
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, at least you have a child.

153
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's good news.

154
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:52,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thousands of others sound sleep when the noise started.

155
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was Katrina hammering away at the roof, trying to get in.

156
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:02,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have one saved message.

157
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:07,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey love. I know I said I was okay but my heart is racing and, okay,

158
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:11,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so, should we chance that out to the hospital,

159
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or do we try to get out of town, because I,

160
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:16,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know if it's just nerves or something serious.

161
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:18,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You decide. I trust you.

162

00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:46,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Mister Hayes? -Uh, yeah.

168
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi. I'm Shelly.

169
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi. Nolan.

170
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:52,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is my turf, so if you need anything, you let me know.

171
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:55,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Okay. -Okay? And I've got something for you.

172
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's your daughter's birth certificate.

173
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have a name for her?

174
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. We talked about it.

175
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:17,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I liked Haley.

176
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But my wife liked anything but Haley.

177
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

178
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:30,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, Katrina seems to be a popular name right now.

179
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, ah... Abby's favorite place...

180
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:39,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}my wife, she...

181
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}she really liked this tree, it was in a park by our house...

182
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:49,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a few years ago, it was struck by lightning.

183
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'd have picnics there.

184
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She always said it was a safe haven.

185
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because of that old saying that...

186
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:01,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-lightning never strikes twice in the same place... -Yeah. Right.

187
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you think that's real?

188
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}About lightning?

189
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:16,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, yeah, I suppose so.

190
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, maybe is not just lightening.

191
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happens if the power goes out?

192
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The generators will kick in. We'll be okay.

193
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This place has weathered storms before.

194
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And most of our equipment has battery backup.

195
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:47,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alright.

196
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's gonna be okay.

197
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:58,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

198
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:00,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're welcome.

199
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You heard her. Everything's gonna be okay.

200
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:05,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Hey, what's going on? -Come on, we gotta go.

201
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-This way people! -Alright, everyone stay together.

202
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Hey, what's going on? -Evacuating. We got three drivers. Come on.

203
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everyone to the rear entrance.

204
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Hey, Doctor Edmonds? -Mister Hayes.

205
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:51,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I thought you said it was bad everywhere. -This is not my call.

206
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Calm and orderly, please!

207
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is there something wrong with the hospital?

208
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're overcrowded and understaffed.

209
00:19:58,290 --> 00:19:59,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The administration just got nervous, that's all.

210
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just a partial evacuation.

211
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Then what are you gonna do with my daughter?

212
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That ventilator isn't portable.

213
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If they order a full evacuation,

214
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we'll get you a private ride to Charity. Okay?

215
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:11,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-So, you come back then? -No, I'm not leaving.

216
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If there's something I can do, just let me know.

217
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sure.

218
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:16,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop the storm.

219
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:17,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's move!

220
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:43,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey! You missed the party, man.

221
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:45,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, it looks like it.

222
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:47,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You going to Charity?

223
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:49,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

224
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Charity Hospital, man. People are leaving.

225
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. I have to stay here.

226
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:57,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know we're closing the cafeteria in a few minutes.

227
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:59,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you think you can get me some food?

228
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, man. The nurses took what was left. Sorry.

229
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:06,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think maybe you can get some coins?

230
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:13,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The ones on the first floor,

231
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:17,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they're gonna be picked over, but if you take the stairs up to four,

232
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:19,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}there's gonna be a little waiting area outside surgery.

233
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Thank you.

234
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're sending me out on the next bus.

235
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tulane they got food, but no cooks.

236
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Alright. Well, good luck. -You too.

237
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait.

238
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some luncheon meat.

239
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:41,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No bread, but salami, some turkey...

240
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:43,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take it, man.

241
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:48,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Nah. No. I can't take your food. -I don't need it like you do.

242
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:57,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was about to get mad.

243
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I appreciate it. -Don't eat that all at once, though.

244
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:26,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, finally some good news.

245
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:31,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A levy that has broken on Lake Pontchartrain from New Orleans.

246
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:33,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is new video that we have just gotten in,

247
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we're seeing it for the first time.

248
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:38,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing to stop this water from just pouring in right now...

249
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:58,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell is that?

250
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's that?

251
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no, no!

252
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:56,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes... Okay.

253
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

254
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, don't do this to me.

255
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:13,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stupid machine.

256
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

257
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:19,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Hey! Hey, we got a bad battery in here!

258
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:23,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, is anybody on this floor? Nurse?

259
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need a battery. Battery. Battery.

260
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alright, hold on.

261
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:53,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alright.

262
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hear you'!

263
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hear you'!

264
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:13,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, you, stupid battery!

265
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:19,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Won't hold a charge.

266
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey! Can somebody get their ass in here, please?!

267
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I could really use some help!

268
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, is anybody here?!

269
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my God! The first floor's flooding.

270
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, we're in 204.

271
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Room 204, please!

272
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Somebody please!

273
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:55,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nolan?

274
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shelly.

275
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The levees broke. The streets are flooding.

276
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:03,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The back entrance is still okay. You can go out that way.

277
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, wait. We gotta get her out of here then.

278
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:06,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We gotta get out the whole thing.

279
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The battery's old and it's only taking a small charge.

280
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:11,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you look at it, it's only good for 3 minutes.

281
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:13,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Move her where?

282
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We could roll it out. Put it on the bus and get it out.

283
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no buses.

284
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:20,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can go up a couple of floors, go to the roof top

285
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and wait for a helicopter to come and...

286
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. The power is out

287
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:25,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we can't get that thing up the stairs by ourselves.

288
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:26,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll have to wait 'til the power comes back on

289
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and then we'll get you a Medevac.

290
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:33,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What, so we're stranded here? -Just until power comes back.

291
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's Doctor Edmonds at?

292
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He left an hour ago.

293
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:39,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What? -He went with some of the ICU patients.

294
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was going to come back with the bus drivers,

295
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but then the levees broke and...

296
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit!

297
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:46,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pump!

298
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, well, I'm not leaving!

299
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:51,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shelly listen, I'm not leaving, so, think about it.

300
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:55,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What else could we do? Come here. What else can we do?

301
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

302
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:58,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

303
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:01,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll go get help.

304
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:04,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay? Just hang in there.

305
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:05,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Well, okay. Go.

306
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:07,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Okay? -Yes. Please, go. You're right.

307
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go, please, but, hurry, Shelly.

308
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:10,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, alright? Hurry!

309
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm told that the New Orleans Police

310
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:30,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}put out a call to all of its officers saying...

311
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if you have a boat bring it here, help us.

312
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:36,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But the officers who have boats cannot get to them in many cases,

313
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because the roads are floaded to their homes.

314
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think you want some, huh?

315
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:00,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't. It's not good for babies.

316
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's the good stuff.

317
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:04,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what's good for you.

318
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:07,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You like it, don't you?

319
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

320
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:53,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not going crazy, I just feel like talking.

321
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:03,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your mother,

322
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:05,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}she had a hard time sleeping at night.

323
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But in the day time,

324
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}she was this real force of nature, she just...

325
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:18,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She ran her own business, and...

326
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She carried herself like a drill sergeant, you know.

327
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She...

328
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}she was bulletproof.

329
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what she was.

330
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But at night she had these...

331
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}she'd have these stress dreams and...

332
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd lay there in bed and...

333
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I would, I would just say anything really, I'd tell her how much I loved her,

334
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I would tell her how everything was going to be okay.

335
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And...

336
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:07,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you know, most of the times, she'd sleep the entire night through.

337
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You would have really loved her.

338
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:34,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's see what else we got.

339
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Baby blanket?

340
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Latex gloves. What are these?

341
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Diapers.

342
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:15,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't even think about that. You probably need your diaper changed.

343
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:18,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got daddy diaper directions.

344
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:23,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't need you. Go away.

345
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:26,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Little diapers for a little baby.

346
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:32,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why isn't that working?

347
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah. Yeah, this is bad.

348
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}God! What has your Mom been feeding you? Charcoal?

349
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:52,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alright. Let's get this one out of there.

350
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Where am I putting this?

351
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:58,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's get a couple of pieces going.

352
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:10,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How does that feel? Does it feel alright?

353
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:17,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Someone please get the next one. 'Cause I am tapped out.

354
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did they give you one of these reports to fill in?

355
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:49,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

356
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:52,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}God! I hate paperwork.

357
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm Nolan, by the way.

358
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Abigail.

359
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Pleasure to meet you. -Nice to meet you.

360
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got suckered. I thought they were gonna deputize me or something.

361
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:03,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What a gyp.

362
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I don't think it works like that.

363
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well it should. I totally stopped that getaway driver.

364
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You saw that, right? -No, No, I saw that.

365
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-That was really good work. -Yeah.

366
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:14,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Yeah. You've done that before. -Yeah, clearly.

367
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:20,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe you can get a reward too. For walking into the other guy.

368
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:24,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Oh, you mean the guy with the gun. -Yeah, that one.

369
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-That guy. -That guy.

370
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Yeah. -Yeah.

371
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:30,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What if I don't wanna be deputized?

372
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well then what are you asking for?

373
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dinner.

374
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:38,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That sounds lovely.

375

377
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in case on the way we see a jaywalker and you,

378
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}all of a sudden, get this urge to run him over...

379
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Yeah? -Yeah.

380
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Really? ...You had to go there. -Yeah.

381
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Yeah, we gotta avoid that stuff. -You know what?

382
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:53,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When I'm deputy tat's gonna be legal.

383
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:01,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, we had our first date that night and then,

384
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:03,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}what, a month later we moved in together.

385
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:08,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everyone thought we were being crazy, but,

386
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:11,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know, it just felt right with her.

387
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:14,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know how else to say it. It just felt right.

388
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:22,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not even the best story. When I proposed...

389
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

390

401
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit.

408
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Orange ones.

409
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:45,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, good. Okay, good.

410
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:48,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grab some more.

411
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One more over there.

412
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:54,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got the orange ones. I got the orange ones!

413
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:56,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold on, baby.

414
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay,

415
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:07,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alright. I can do this. That's right.

416
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:10,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

417
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good.

418
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:40,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm back.

419
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:43,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everything's gonna be all right, sweetheart.

420
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:50,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, everything's gonna be okay.

421
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:55,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And those problems are likely to linger, Brian.

422
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:58,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The water is a problem for, throughout the metro area.

423
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:02,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}People are being told to boil it and electricity is also the problem.

424
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:03,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hardly anybody has it

425
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:07,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and isn't likely to have it for up to a month.

426
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:13,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is your Mom.

427
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She was on a panel at a convention.

428
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:20,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And... the convention was on event planning,

429
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:28,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was really just an event to discuss planning other events.

430
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:35,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I keep this picture because...

431
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:39,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}she'd argue that she didn't look cute when she was angry.

432
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And she used to hate it when I told her that.

433
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:49,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

434
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:52,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pretty cute, huh?

435
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:59,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me see what else we have.

436
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:02,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hear you.

437
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, here we go.

438
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is when I proposed to your Mom.

439
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:24,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me preface by saying that before I started dating your mother...

440
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}she hated the idea of marriage.

441
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:30,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She said it was "the death of the individual."

442
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:37,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. So she plans this romantic getaway to this beach.

443
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:40,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was really a business write-off

444
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:42,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because the hotel was trying to get her to host events there.

445
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:45,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And... I don't know,

446
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just thought it'd be a perfect time to pop the question, so...

447
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I had my grandmother's ring restored.

448
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:59,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They gave these to me before your mother went into labor.

449
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know.

450
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:29,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, we went to dinner that night.

451
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And it was this...

452
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it was a fancy restaurant at the end of this pier.

453
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:41,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was perfect, really, so, you know, the drink order came and...

454
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:45,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I dropped to one knee, pulled the ring out...

455
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:48,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}she got mad.

456
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She got so mad at me,

457
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:55,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}her nostrils flaring, all-the-way mad.

458
00:40:58,050 --> 00:40:59,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't know what was going on.

459
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:01,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She gets up and she throws her napkin down on the table.

460
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:04,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought I was gonna shatter into a million pieces.

461
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:06,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's why I asked her. "What's wrong?"

462
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And she pulled out this ring.

463
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She said, "You, idiot, I was gonna propose to you!"

464
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:22,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's when this roving photographer snapped this photo of us.

465
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:28,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What else do I have?

466
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know that's somebody I would have liked you to met.

467
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:44,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You two are quite alike, really.

468
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This here? This is your life.

469
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:01,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is you at 3 months.

470
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:04,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kinda look like you're laying in a hammock. You think?

471
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's see what we got.

472
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:11,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, this is when you had us really worried.

473
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:13,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were trying to get all your nutrients from your Mom.

474
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were doing the best you could, but, we didn't know.

475
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:20,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This was a month later. You see that?

476
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:23,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your Mom was on this crazy diet, she was taking vitamins and supplements,

477
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:25,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}everything that she could to keep you healthy

478
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you just kept hanging on.

479
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:29,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're a fighter.

480
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what the Doctors kept saying.

481
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kinda like your granddad.

482
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:46,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All action and no words.

483
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now you got me.

484
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Time for me to do the heavy lifting.

485
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:03,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I gotta put in my hours.

486
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I'm on the clock.

487
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:24,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's been some huge health concerns

488
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with poisonous snakes out there, fire ants

489
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:29,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and mosquitos infecting the city. Have you heard much

490
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:34,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}about how concerned health officials are about those folks whom...

491
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}weren't fortunate to get out.

492
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:13,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When you start working again, I'll hear you.

493
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:20,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Radio.

494
00:44:43,370 --> 00:44:44,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

495
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:47,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

496
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:53,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

497
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:01,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Be right back.

498
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:06,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello? Hello, can anybody hear me?

499
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:09,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

500
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:13,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello, can anybody hear me?

501
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:17,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on!

502
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:22,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! Go, go, go!

503
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is Commander John Engel of the U.S. Coast Guard.

504
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:27,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anyone broadcasting on this channel, over.

505

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please, respond, over.

506
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,840

507
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:39,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-for evacuation emergency precautions. -I hear you! No! Stay on!

508
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:42,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Hello?

509
00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:45,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello. Hey, can you hear me? This is Nolan Hayes.

633
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:20,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, pooch, you have a name? Hm?

637
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:35,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Storm. Kind of fit it right now. Storm, it's good.

641
01:04:52,510 --> 01:04:55,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's gonna take a while, obviously. You might as well take a nap.

642
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:05,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Clearly you're smarter than I thought,

01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:42,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hope you're embarrassed.

650

01:06:09,890 --> 01:06:11,750

01:06:48,060 --> 01:06:50,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't have time for this.

661
01:06:50,530 --> 01:06:51,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't have time? Hmm?

01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:20,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That did not feel like married sex at all.

666
01:07:21,430 --> 01:07:25,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Yeah, we should get dressed before my wife gets back.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Quarter mile of power lines over on 17th, just gone.

720
01:12:12,150 --> 01:12:14,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They gonna have to lay new wire first.

721
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:16,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about the relief groups? What about the...

722
01:12:17,390 --> 01:12:19,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about the Red Cross and FEMA,

723

725
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:30,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoever, man. You got any food?

726
01:12:37,410 --> 01:12:38,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

727
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:41,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna take these, man. You can keep the rest.

728
01:12:42,380 --> 01:12:44,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, don't you do this to me. Look at this.

729
01:12:44,550 --> 01:12:47,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at my situation, man. Look at the baby here.

730
01:12:47,490 --> 01:12:50,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you go and start taking my food. This, I need help.

731
01:12:50,490 --> 01:12:51,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not my problem.

732
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:53,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just go get me some help.

733
01:12:53,530 --> 01:12:55,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There ain't nobody out there gonna help you, man.

734
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:58,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm being real nice lettin' you keep all the Cokes.

735
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:02,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, alright? I just need help.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna give you my watch, okay? Here, take this.

737
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:06,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want you to take my watch.

738
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:08,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna give you some money.

739
01:13:10,310 --> 01:13:12,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What am I gonna do with a watch, man?

740
01:13:19,250 --> 01:13:21,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm desperate. Okay?

741
01:13:21,390 --> 01:13:23,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what I have. I'm desperate here, okay?

742
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:27,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I'm pleading with you as a stranger. Look at my situation, man.

743
01:13:27,390 --> 01:13:31,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just want you to go out there and just tell somebody about me.

744
01:13:32,230 --> 01:13:34,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell them what's going on. That's free. That doesn't cost you anything.

745
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Just... -All the other people out there now,

746
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:38,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you don't want them to know about you.

747
01:13:38,470 --> 01:13:39,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're a lot worse than me.

748
01:13:40,670 --> 01:13:42,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Folks raiding all the pharmacies.

749
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:46,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can't go ten minutes without hearing another gunshot.

750
01:13:47,180 --> 01:13:48,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now you stay real quiet here.

751
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:52,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, listen, I don't know what somebody else's going to want!

752
01:13:52,450 --> 01:13:53,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll put you down, man!

753
01:13:55,020 --> 01:13:56,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

754
01:14:02,330 --> 01:14:04,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Call off your dog, man. -Easy.

755
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:09,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Call off your dog! -No, Sherlock, don't.

756
01:14:10,370 --> 01:14:11,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Relax.

757
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:17,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

758
01:14:30,690 --> 01:14:31,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sherlock!

759
01:14:33,660 --> 01:14:34,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Sherlock!

760
01:14:36,030 --> 01:14:36,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get off me!

761
01:14:51,110 --> 01:14:55,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey! Drop the bag! The dog just wants the I.V. bags!

762
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:03,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why the hell does he have these?

763
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:31,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were gonna bring these to me.

764
01:15:36,390 --> 01:15:38,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You bastard!

765
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:42,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She was a nurse! She was a nurse!

766
01:16:34,910 --> 01:16:37,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't even question why I do it.

767
01:16:38,580 --> 01:16:39,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just do it.

768
01:16:42,820 --> 01:16:44,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I keep cranking this thing,

769
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:47,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then I check on the baby.

770
01:16:53,430 --> 01:16:57,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna crank until my arms fall off or I'll die trying.

771
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:01,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know.

772
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:07,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're so stubborn.

773
01:17:09,550 --> 01:17:11,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love that about you.

774
01:17:17,020 --> 01:17:19,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I don't get it. -Get what, baby?

775
01:17:20,530 --> 01:17:24,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This. Why this?

776
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This wasn't supposed to happen.

777
01:17:29,470 --> 01:17:30,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know.

778
01:17:33,210 --> 01:17:37,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But sometimes you just have to hold onto whatever you can.

779
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:45,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I won't be a good father. Not like I was a husband.

780
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:47,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, you will.

781
01:17:51,420 --> 01:17:54,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you remember Marc's birthday party?

782
01:17:55,660 --> 01:17:56,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

783
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:59,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We were all loitering in the parking lot, and...

784
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:02,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the plan was to go to the dive bar next door,

785
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:04,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}keep the party going.

786
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:10,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you said that we couldn't make it because I had to work the next day

787
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:12,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you had to get me to bed.

788
01:18:13,950 --> 01:18:17,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Yeah, and you were pissed. -Oh, yeah.

789
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:25,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But secretly...

790
01:18:25,990 --> 01:18:27,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I loved that.

791
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:33,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because I knew right then and there,

792
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:38,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you'd be an amazing father.

793
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:51,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, I need you. You know?

794
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:56,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't wanna do this without you.

795
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:05,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have me.

796
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:07,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You always will.

797
01:19:15,540 --> 01:19:17,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She is you and me together.

798
01:19:21,650 --> 01:19:23,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not alone, Nolan.

799
01:19:27,890 --> 01:19:29,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Abigail.

800
01:19:31,890 --> 01:19:33,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's listening.

801
01:19:35,630 --> 01:19:37,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She recognizes your voice.

802
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:53,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Abigail...

803
01:20:01,290 --> 01:20:02,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm so tired.

804
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:07,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just tired.

805
01:20:07,460 --> 01:20:10,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If they don't have a radio they're not exactly sure what's going on.

806
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:13,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We actually had one gentleman giving us some sort of Morse Code...

807
01:20:14,070 --> 01:20:16,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with his flashlight this morning in the early darkness,

808
01:20:16,870 --> 01:20:18,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}trying to signal to us...

809
01:21:41,190 --> 01:21:42,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}16\nSixteen...

810
01:21:45,290 --> 01:21:46,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}17\nseventeen...

811
01:22:14,390 --> 01:22:15,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I'm coming.

812
01:22:42,910 --> 01:22:44,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

813
01:22:46,890 --> 01:22:50,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, and soon you're gonna be breathing on your own.

814
01:22:51,190 --> 01:22:53,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Baby, almost.

815
01:22:55,260 --> 01:22:56,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just a little longer.

816
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:02,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Doctor said 48 hours, so that should be pretty soon.

817
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just hang on a little bit longer. Okay?

818
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:10,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then we'll go home.

819
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:18,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah.
