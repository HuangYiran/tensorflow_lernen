1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,250
<i>Previously on Hostages...</i>

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:04,770
Who the hell are you?

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:06,580
I know you're related to Nina Carlisle.

4
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,570
Trust me,you don't want
to get involved in this.

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,750
You're Kate Renner. Nina's mother.

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,760
- Glad you could make it.
- What do you want?

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,370
I need a friend inside
Duncan's operation.

8
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,300
You're talking to the wrong girl.

9
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,480
Okay,a spy.

10
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:28,250
What are you offering?

11
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:35,090
Just because we're sleeping together,you
do not get to treat me like your secretary.

12
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:40,570
- OTI has to end.
- You want to dismantle it?

13
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:41,780
I want to expose it.

14
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,140
OTI is important. Don't give this bastard
a chance to take that away from you.

15
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,570
Do we really want to bet the future
of this country on Dr. Sanders?

16
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,450
Or Duncan Carlisle?

17
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:56,860
They tried and failed. Why should we
believe they'll pull it off this time?

18
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,070
Kramer took a photo of a guy
talking to the Secret Service agent.

19
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,210
You got a name?

20
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,960
Robert Harper. Former Army
Ranger and decorated sniper.

21
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,370
Sniper?

22
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,310
Did you kill him?

23
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,600
I went to his apartment,but
he wasn't there.

24
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,280
He's on a plane to New
York City right now.

25
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,920
If he's trying to kill you,why
is he on his way to New York?

26
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,110
Because I'm not the target.

27
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,920
The President is.

28
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,630
He's scheduled to be in
New York all day tomorrow.

29
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,960
If they succeed,Nina dies.

30
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:28,640
Then we need to get there first.

31
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:44,520
The president is gonna
be in New York today.

32
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,620
Another team is being assembled
to take him out while he's there.

33
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,400
- We have to stop them.
- Hold up there.

34
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,940
- How exactly is that on us?
- Target goes away,our payday goes away.

35
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,580
- Our deal is with you.
- Your deal is to complete the mission.

36
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:01,180
We can't do that if somebody
beats us to the punch.

37
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,060
So how do we do it?

38
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,690
None of this is your fault.

39
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,840
You didn't ask for this,and
you don't deserve it.

40
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:18,690
But now that we're here,we have to do
everything we can to make the right decisions.

41
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,200
We shouldn't be helping these people.

42
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,830
- What about when we don't have a choice?
- You always have a choice.

43
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:29,020
- Mom says we need to cooperate.
- Cooperate? Yeah.

44
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,020
Not collaborate.

45
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:34,010
- What does that mean?
- It means that

46
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,690
when this is over I want you to be able
to look at yourselves in the mirror.

47
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,900
I don't want to let them turn you
into something that you're not.

48
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:47,150
They made you lie to Boyd's
father about his death.

49
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,460
And they made you come up
with a phony alibi for Kramer.

50
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,050
Where is this gonna end?

51
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:56,800
- With Mom killing the president.
- I don't accept that.

52
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:01,160
And if it does,then...

53
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:05,590
If it does,then what?

54
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,970
I don't want this
family to lose its way.

55
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,000
Everybody on your feet.
You're coming with us.

56
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,890
Let's go. Move! Get up!

57
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,200
Move! Up!

58
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,660
<i>TEXT MESSAGE ******</i>

59
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,970
I'm glad you called.

60
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,280
So all I gotta do is
tell you what's going on?

61
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,890
Like I said last night,all
I need is information.

62
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,810
Where people are,what they're doing.

63
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,500
You're my eyes and ears.

64
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:53,020
I want to know if Duncan's sticking to the
plan,that he's watching the Sanders family 24/7.

65
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,950
And,if he's not,call me.

66
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:58,050
How do I know you're gonna
deliver on your end of this?

67
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,970
Two Canadian passports. One
for you,one for your son.

68
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,020
And what about the cash?

69
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:20,650
Keep it. Consider it a
gesture of good faith.

70
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,020
I'll give you the rest
when this is all over.

71
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,730
10 grand is nothing to
the people I'm working for.

72
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:31,480
They just wanna know
what's going on with Duncan.

73
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:34,940
It's an insurance policy. That's all.

74
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,230
You made the right decision.

75
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:43,620
Trust me. It's much better
than the alternative.

76
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,530
I've gotta get back.

77
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,610
Sit down.

78
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:56,400
Windows are nailed shut. Door
will be locked from the outside.

79
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,720
You're gonna be in here for a
while,so make yourselves comfortable.

80
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,340
What's going on?

81
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:05,030
None of you are leaving the house today.

82
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:26,850
I've sent Sandrine and Kramer ahead
to start surveillance on this church.

83
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:30,380
And to look for the sharp shooter
we saw yesterday,Robert Harper.

84
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,860
You and I are gonna try
and narrow the search.

85
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,520
What do you know about
the president's schedule?

86
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:39,040
Off the record trips are low-profile.
The goal is to avoid being noticed.

87
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:43,750
Kincaid will be in an unmarked SUV,without
the usual number of Secret Service agents.

88
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,410
They'll most likely bring him
through this back alley,here.

89
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,380
Why don't we simply
call in a bomb threat?

90
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,430
- Make them divert his plans.
- If we do anything to make

91
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:57,630
Kincaid's security detail suspect there's a plot against
him,protocol dictates they completely change his itinerary.

92
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,450
That would include the location of
his surgery,and the staff performing.

93
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:07,240
We need to find this other hit team and take
them out,without anybody knowing it happened.

94
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,710
Hello,it's Burton. Am I all
set on that flight to Madrid?

95
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,470
Two tickets.

96
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:16,680
For myself,and for my granddaughter.

97
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,270
Okay. Let me know as soon as possible.

98
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,870
- Kate.
- Hello,Burton.

99
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,360
Come inside.

100
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:44,000
What are you doing here? I
thought we had an arrangement.

101
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,000
I know. I'm sorry.

102
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,080
You shouldn't be here,ever.

103
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,690
- A woman came to see me.
- Yes?

104
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,730
- Dr. Sanders.
- Why didn't you tell me Nina was sick?

105
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,730
Because...

106
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:01,070
we always said you would move on with
your life and put Nina behind you.

107
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,070
- Why burden you with her health problems?
- She's still my daughter.

108
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:08,580
- I had a right to know.
- Is that why you're here,Kate?

109
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,950
I'm here because I
want to tell my story.

110
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:18,370
I want to expose Kincaid.

111
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,650
Things in place in New York?

112
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,140
I just spoke to the team leader.

113
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,150
They landed last night.
They're assembling now.

114
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,600
- Everything's a go.
- Good.

115
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,750
Good. What about the girl?
She accept your offer?

116
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:35,620
She's in.

117
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,960
Okay. Stay in contact with
her throughout the day.

118
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,740
The minute we're done in New York,we need
to be ready to move on Duncan and his team.

119
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,630
- I understand.
- Duncan needs to go first.

120
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,190
Then the others.

121
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,160
What about the Sanders family?

122
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,240
Make it a murder-suicide.

123
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:58,980
A weapon will be left in the father's hand,with a
note,bemoaning his financial issues and marital problems.

124
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:07,660
It's never pleasant taking out innocent
civilians,but we don't have a choice.

128
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,930
If I were them,I'd be
looking to get some elevation.

129
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:36,750
Only a few structures in the vicinity have the
heightened position to give you an angle on that alley.

130
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,340
The sniper team will be looking for
a quick exit to a major thoroughfare.

131
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,470
I only see three buildings
that fit the bill.

132
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:45,640
- One. Two. Three.
- Yeah.

133
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,560
- Which one will they use?
- Don't know yet,

134
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:51,610
but a sniper's only as good as his spotter,and
a spotter is only as good as his vantage point.

135
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:52,700
We need more information.

136
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,900
We don't have enough time to do an
internal recon in three high-rise buildings.

137
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,160
You're right.

138
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:01,830
We need the blueprints for each
building with complete specifications.

139
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,570
How are we gonna get those?

140
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:13,020
After that doctor left,I started thinking
about all those secrets I kept,for so long.

141
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,320
I got angry.

142
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:19,820
I've told my husband everything.

143
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:23,290
Kate,we had a deal.

144
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:27,080
And I can only imagine how difficult

145
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:29,160
- these past years...
- Decades!

146
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:37,710
...decades have been for you,but Kincaid's a
dangerous man. I don't need to tell you that.

147
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:41,940
He's a lot more powerful
than he was 35 years ago.

148
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,380
I'll take my chances.

149
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,690
I think I'm old enough to
make that decision for myself.

150
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,760
What about for Nina?

151
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,420
She's at risk as well.

152
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,910
Nina has terminal leukemia.

153
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:58,140
According to that doctor,there's
no match for her bone marrow,right?

154
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:02,110
I want my daughter to know
the truth before she dies.

155
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:05,720
We haven't given up.

156
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,120
I need something from you.

157
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,300
I want schematics on three
buildings in New York.

158
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,560
- Schematics? What for?
- Your firm has a password

159
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,560
for the property clerk's database
in most major cities,correct?

160
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,820
Yeah,they do,but I can't
access them whenever I want.

161
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:28,930
- It's not that simple.
- Why do you need the specs?

162
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:33,970
It's important to all of us.

163
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,480
Well,I'm sorry. There
are a lot of regulations.

164
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,180
Privacy,security restrictions.

165
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:41,120
Can't help you.

166
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,920
Can't? Or won't?

167
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,100
Both.

168
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:56,950
You still haven't
learned anything,Brian.

169
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,470
On your feet. Let's go.

170
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:03,530
- Mom!
- Mom!

171
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,120
Where are you taking her?

172
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,380
Mom!

173
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,160
You wanted to tell me something?

174
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,640
I think I can get the
schematics you need.

175
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,780
- Good.
- But I want to know.

176
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,990
What's it for? I know the
president is in New York today.

177
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:44,470
What are... Are you gonna kill him?

178
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:47,930
No. I'm gonna save him.

179
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,000
But I need those specs,Ellen. Soon.

180
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,660
Here.

181
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:19,970
If I fail in New York,Ellen,if you
hear that the president has been killed,

182
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:29,580
then you need to go upstairs,free your
family,and get the hell out of here. Fast.

183
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:33,000
- Do you understand what I'm telling you?
- Yes.

184
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,030
I know you'll never believe me,but...

185
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:45,970
I wish you never had to be involved.

186
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,070
Thank you for coming.

187
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:08,800
I was really surprised
that you called me.

188
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:12,400
I thought you guys were in Montreal?
Why isn't Brian back at the office?

189
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:15,810
Well,that's why I'm here. Brian...

190
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:20,010
- got himself into some financial trouble.
- I don't understand.

191
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:24,470
Well,the company is heavily
leveraged. Deeply,deeply in debt.

192
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:29,140
Then about six months ago,he borrowed
a large sum of money from some people.

193
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:33,930
The wrong people. And then
when he couldn't pay them back

194
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:40,360
they,they threatened to hurt our family.

195
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,150
What?

196
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:43,630
That's why he dropped the
passports off that day.

197
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,500
We thought we had to get out
of the country in a hurry.

198
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,380
Why didn't Brian say anything to me?

199
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:50,380
Well,I don't think he
wanted to get you involved.

200
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:55,090
He's out of town right now,but
he really needs your help.

201
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,730
We need your help.

202
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:03,310
I don't blame you for
anything that happened.

203
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:06,130
All I care about right now
is protecting my family.

204
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:07,530
Why don't you go to the police?

205
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:11,090
That would make it even worse. I
mean,these people are really dangerous.

206
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,140
- They would hurt our kids.
- Right.

207
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,090
Well,what do you need from me?

208
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,840
Your company access code.

209
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:23,020
We need the schematics for
three buildings in New York.

210
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:29,190
For the business deal,just to help
Brian dig himself out of this mess.

211
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:35,050
This is Nina's sixth birthday party.

212
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:40,880
And why does the boy standing next to
her have frosting all over his face?

213
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,710
Oh,that's Alex. He lived two
doors down. Bit of a bully.

214
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:50,730
Alex made the mistake of trying to take
Nina's cupcake,and she shoved it in his face.

215
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:55,460
So Nina was a tough one?

216
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:58,290
She still is.

217
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,240
According to the doctors,she
should have been dead months ago.

218
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,520
- She's a fighter.
- You did a wonderful job raising her,Burton.

219
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,670
I would have liked to
have been a part of it.

220
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,680
But I'm glad she had you.

221
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,250
She still does. I'll
never give up on her.

222
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:21,190
I just put all of this
out of my head for so long.

223
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:24,140
You,Nina,Kincaid.

224
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:28,290
Now it's just rushing
back,like a fresh wound.

225
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,420
And the enormity of what
he did to all of our lives.

226
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:39,810
God,it just makes me so angry.

227
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:42,550
But in the end,we won.

228
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:48,860
We beat him. Nina grew up protected
from any knowledge of that terrible past.

229
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:53,140
You forged a new life!
You have a husband,a home.

230
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:59,370
Go back to it,Kate. You don't
want to stir up any ghosts.

231
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:00,740
No.

232
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,010
I kept quiet for too long.

233
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:08,890
You said it yourself. Nina is a fighter.

234
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,190
I wanna show her I'm a fighter too.

235
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:26,470
<i>TEXT MESSAGE</i>

236
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,380
What's up?

237
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,110
Nothing. It's about my son.

238
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,900
Was that his father?

239
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,680
No,his father and I don't talk.

240
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,510
- Sorry.
- Don't be.

241
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,050
It's a good thing.

242
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,530
You don't have to talk about
it if you don't want to.

243
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,920
I met him when I was
working undercover in Mexico.

244
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,430
It didn't end well.

245
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:02,210
That's why I don't let my
feelings interfere with business.

246
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:06,380
Where do you think they took Mom?

247
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:10,740
They won't hurt her. They
need her for the surgery.

248
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,320
What was that all about?

249
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:14,810
Why do they need building plans?

250
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:16,150
I'm not sure.

251
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:18,660
Then you should have
just given them to him.

252
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,980
It doesn't matter what we do
anyway. We can't stop them.

253
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,630
If you believe that,then
they've already won.

254
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,690
Morgan,look at me.

255
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,620
They put a bullet in me.

256
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:34,360
They took over my house.
They terrorized my family.

257
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:37,850
They threatened everything
I care about in this world.

258
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,110
And I'm not defeated.

259
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,910
And I'm not going to
let them defeat you.

260
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,270
It's not a physical battle.

261
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,970
It's psychological.

262
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:59,150
So long as we're united,so
long as we're together on this.

263
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:02,870
We're so much stronger
than they'll ever be.

264
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:06,830
It doesn't matter how
many guns they have.

265
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:22,630
Look,when this whole thing is over,

266
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:28,470
I don't want to say goodbye to you.

267
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,730
I understand.

268
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:35,830
I feel the same way.

269
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:54,740
If something does
happen today,I'm sorry.

270
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:59,230
I'm sorry we didn't get to
spend more time together.

271
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:17,710
I just don't see why your trip to St. Theodore's
should be off the record,Mr. President.

272
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,770
It's a great PR story.

273
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,710
A personal prayer visit to a church
built by your great-grandfather?

274
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,820
That's a no-brainer to grab
more of the Christian vote.

275
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:31,570
I spend 90% of my day
on empty gestures,Ted.

276
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,730
Every once in a while,I have to do
something that actually has meaning.

277
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:40,830
Listen. I know I'm a sinner.

278
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,840
I have many flaws.

279
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,860
I make no apologies for most of them.

280
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:48,230
It's simply my nature.

281
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,680
But I try to make my peace
with God,nevertheless.

282
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:56,690
And if I'm gonna have even the
slimmest hope for redemption,

283
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:02,250
I can't exploit that by
turning it into a photo op.

284
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,470
Things move fast after an assassination.
You recall the chaos when Reagan was shot?

285
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:15,270
- And that was unsuccessful.
- First priority.

286
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:19,550
Are we absolutely certain that nothing
can be traced back to us or our partners?

287
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,130
There's no direct money trail.

288
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:23,390
The team we have in
place are professionals.

289
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:26,420
- They'll disappear the minute it's over.
- And then?

290
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:30,310
NSA intercepts will be leaked to the
press implicating a foreign terrorist cell.

291
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:34,180
Money transfers will point to the involvement
of a certain Middle Eastern country.

292
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,680
And the rumor mill
will take it from there.

293
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,200
And my sister will never know the truth.

294
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:41,910
Not that she's ever
been interested in it.

295
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:44,430
When will you move on the
FBI agent and his team?

296
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:46,800
As soon as the operation is confirmed.

297
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:51,400
Wilson. Get a GPS trace up on the phone
Carlisle was using to communicate with Logan.

298
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,410
I want you to start
monitoring his position.

299
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:56,020
- The rest of his team,too.
-  Yes,sir!

300
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,100
The foreign terrorist
cell is a nice touch.

301
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,980
It will set things up perfectly
with the vice president.

302
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,410
- When are you speaking with him?
- I'm on my way now.

303
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:07,100
We're going to discuss potential running
mates for his presidential campaign.

304
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:09,110
Are you confident you have his ear?

305
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,560
100%.

306
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,440
When I'm finished,you will
be at the top of his list.

307
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,980
Ellen!

308
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,550
I think I got everything you asked for.

309
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:37,210
- Is there anything else I can do?
- No,thank you.

310
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:40,350
You know,I really admire you.

311
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,930
I do.

312
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,940
The way you're standing by him.

313
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:50,650
The only reason I got involved with
Brian is just the way he described things.

314
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,960
The way,the way things
were between you two.

315
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:56,120
The way things were between us?

316
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:01,510
He told me that your marriage was a lie.

317
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,790
But clearly that's not the case.

318
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:08,660
The fact that you're doing all of this
for him,even after finding out about us,I,

319
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:13,330
I admire it and I'm so,so sorry,Ellen.

320
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:18,150
- I'm so sorry.
- Thank you,Samantha.

321
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,190
Thank you.

322
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:29,420
Sir,I can't track
Agent Carlisle's phone.

323
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,460
Did you try the girl?

324
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,320
The one Logan has working
for us in Duncan's group?

325
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,430
Can't reach her. And there's nothing
emanating from their burner phones.

326
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:38,510
They removed their batteries.

327
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,860
Start pulling up satellite imagery and
running it through facial recognition.

328
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,940
Find them. I don't want any loose ends.

329
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:50,240
Why are we switching burners?

330
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,790
The one calling the
shots isn't playing games.

331
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:56,130
If they win today,they'll
be looking to get rid of us.

332
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,000
How do you know?

333
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,680
Because that's what I would
do if I were in their shoes.

334
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,220
- What would you pick?
- Hard to say from here.

335
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:06,660
I think we should split
up. Search all three.

336
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,210
Kincaid will be here
in exactly 72 minutes.

337
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:14,090
That's not enough time for a proper
sweep on one of these buildings.

338
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,810
We need more info.

339
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:18,120
Ellen should be calling
any minute. We wait for her.

340
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,960
I think you're putting
way too much faith in her.

341
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,200
I'm not as big a believer.

342
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,410
Ellen.

343
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,490
I have the plans,but they're
monsters,like hundreds of pages.

344
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:35,850
I can't make heads or tails.

345
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:38,220
Okay,Ellen. Find the Widmark Tower.

346
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,010
It has all black sheeting.

347
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,940
I need to know what kind of
coating is on the windows.

348
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:45,380
Okay,trying to find it.

349
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,600
Focus,Ellen.

350
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,500
All these symbols and
markings,it's like hieroglyphics.

351
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,390
What the hell does it
matter what glass coating?

352
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:53,780
They're inside the
building,they're not scaling it.

353
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,060
The coating illuminates too much
of the light passing through,

354
00:23:56,060 --> 00:24:00,260
it's going to be very hard for them to get an
accurate view from that distance in the afternoon.

355
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,980
Okay,I found it. The glass is high
efficiency-rated,triple paint,33% tint.

356
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:09,000
Then they're not in there.
Okay Ellen,the Ormont building.

357
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:13,230
From street level it looks like it gives a
vantage point,but it's built on a corner lot.

358
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,230
Find the surveyor's
report for the foundation.

359
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,840
I need the exact angle it's built on.

360
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:22,530
Just look for terms like anchor
bolts,and rebars,stuff like that.

361
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,130
Rebar. Here it is.

362
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:29,030
Engineer's foundation
report,42.5 degrees.

363
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,430
42 and a half degrees.

364
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:32,900
That angle,from the highest floors?

365
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:40,180
Shooter would have to press his trigger against the
window to get a good look down 25th. Too hard a shot.

366
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:42,580
Building's out.

367
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,880
Then that's the building.

368
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:46,170
The De Soleil Hotel.

369
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,870
Okay Ellen,I've gotta go.
We don't have much time.

370
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:52,670
Go home,listen to the
news. If anything happens...

371
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,480
I know what to do.

372
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,840
Good luck.

373
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,210
I feel like I never get
to see you anymore,Vanessa.

374
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,570
You were the best staffer I ever had.

375
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,020
A sacrifice of higher office.

376
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,000
You wanted to be vice president.

377
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:19,710
No,I didn't. But it was clear Paul Kincaid was going
to get the nomination,so I just jumped on the ticket.

378
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,550
And as I recall,you're the
one who advised me to do it.

379
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,560
Politics makes strange bedfellows.

380
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,140
It does indeed.

381
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:31,690
Which is why I want your counsel again.

382
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:36,350
As you might imagine,people are already beginning
to strategize about the election two years from now.

383
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,600
So you've made up your mind to run
when Kincaid's second term is up?

384
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:44,400
- It feels awfully early to think about.
- It's never too early.

385
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,970
So what about Senator
Lansbury as a running mate?

386
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:50,680
His people have already approached me.

387
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,810
- No.
- No?

388
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:56,030
No senators. No representatives.

389
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:58,350
Congress has a single-digit
approval rating.

390
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,710
Anybody you pick would be poison.

391
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:05,620
Since you were a governor,you can't add another
person with a voting record to the ticket.

392
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,660
So where do I look?

393
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:11,190
You need a fresh face.
Not an elected official.

394
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:16,730
Someone with instant name recognition,media
appeal and non-partisan credentials.

395
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:21,240
You'll need international experience to
bolster the ticket and,since you're from Texas,

396
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:25,260
you'll need somebody who
can deliver the coasts.

397
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,720
I know exactly who you're describing.

398
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,160
I'm not describing anybody in
particular,just laying out the facts.

399
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:38,680
You were always the
smartest person in the room.

400
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:44,900
The only question is,are
you interested in running?

401
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:50,720
Kramer,remember snipers
like to work in pairs.

402
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:52,730
Robert Harper will have a spotter.

403
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:55,840
Statistically,he's a white male,20s,30s.

404
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,950
- Probably wearing sunglasses.
- Sunglasses?

405
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,790
They like to protect their eyes.

406
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:04,370
- I got nothing.
- Next floor. Let's move.

407
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:52,680
Sandrine,I think we found the spotter.

408
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,850
Run room 3609,meet
us at the car in five.

409
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:58,650
Are you sure you want
to go through with this?

410
00:27:58,650 --> 00:27:59,900
I am.

411
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:04,020
Okay.

412
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,370
Well,we might as well do it properly.

413
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:12,780
I'll go get out my video camera,and
we'll tape your statement.

414
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:20,280
I never knew Nina was so much
like her mother,so strong-willed.

415
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:29,490
You know,I remember one winter,Nina wanted to
stand on her sled and go down Franklin Hill.

416
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:33,650
I told her she could
get hurt,and she did.

417
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:43,280
Later,when she was being stitched up at the
doctor's office,I thought I should be mad.

418
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,620
But I wasn't. I was just scared.

419
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:53,000
The thought of something happening
to that girl terrified me.

420
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:57,190
All I wanted was to keep her safe.

421
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:06,730
And in that moment,I knew that there was nothing that
I wouldn't do to protect her for the rest of her life.

422
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:14,010
I'm asking you,for her
sake. Don't do this.

423
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,340
Reconsider.

424
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:22,830
If she is going to die,let her go
without knowing the whole,ugly truth.

425
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:26,480
If you like,I could talk to Nina.

426
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,380
We could change our arrangement.

427
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:32,760
You would let the two
of us meet,face-to-face?

428
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:35,090
Yes.

429
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,020
Okay.

430
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:44,260
I'll,I'll wait.

431
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:49,250
I've kept this secret 35 years. I
guess I can keep it a little longer.

432
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:56,250
You have no idea how glad I am
you made that decision,Katherine.

433
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:08,250
Ran the room. It was paid in cash,and the name
it was registered to had no prior addresses

434
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,100
or matching Social Security number.

435
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,810
No doubt it's them. Keep lookout
and stay in communication.

436
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:17,020
Get behind the wheel and
keep the motor running.

437
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:19,390
You ready to run 36 floors?

438
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,720
- Time?
- 39 minutes.

439
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:23,450
Let's do it twice.

440
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,120
Quick. Quiet. Clean.

441
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,040
Clear!

442
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,540
That was the spotter.
Where's the shooter?

443
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:28,750
- The spotter's dead. The sniper's gone.
- What do you mean,gone?

444
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:32,660
They aren't taking the hit from the hotel,they're
just using it to get an eye on Kincaid.

445
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,260
Hold on. Hold on.

446
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:35,920
I have eyes on the sniper.

447
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:37,540
Robert Harper,he's
with another white male.

448
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,590
They're both wearing
electric company uniforms.

449
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,920
- Maintain surveillance.
- Copy that.

450
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:51,890
- I've lost them.
-  Don't move.

451
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:05,070
- What do ya got?
- Look at this.

452
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:08,490
The church is circled.
This is their plan.

453
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:09,580
I'm going to go through the paperwork.

454
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:12,530
You keep an eye out for
Kincaid. He's minutes away.

455
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:22,010
Hey,Logan,you're a real ball
of personality,aren't you?

456
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:24,700
Sorry,Mr. President,I'm just
trying to keep us on schedule.

457
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,210
We'll be fine.

458
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,590
Sir,I've got a hit on
Duncan Carlisle in New York.

459
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:37,700
23rd and Broadway,15 minutes ago.

460
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,310
Son of a bitch.

461
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,490
He's at the go location.

462
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:44,480
He's trying to sabotage
this whole thing.

463
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:59,180
President's convoy located.
Half click from the church.

464
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,670
Sandrine.

465
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:19,660
I found a public notice about roadwork
being done on Broadway and 25th.

466
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:21,970
An electric company van parked
there wouldn't draw any suspicion.

467
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:25,460
- Get over there now and take 'em out.
- Copy.

468
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,750
Got a red light. It'll turn soon though.

469
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,410
They're almost at the church.

470
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:43,950
Beta,this is Charlie. Do you
have target confirmation yet?

471
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:48,040
- Can't establish comm.
- Proceed as planned.

472
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:51,130
I'll engage the target
with my scope,if necessary.

473
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:08,870
Kincaid's arriving.

474
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,230
Listen to me.

475
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,070
You have been compromised.

476
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:39,510
Stay frosty,but I want
this operation carried out.

477
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:44,460
Copy that,sir. Situation normal here.
Only issue is I've lost comm with Beta.

478
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:04,590
Two Canadian passports. One
for you,one for your son.

479
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:18,740
Sandrine. Sandrine!

480
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:23,220
Where are you? You need to
get to them,and take the shot.

481
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,440
Clear to exit vehicle,sir.

482
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:57,150
You all right? No falling
down on the job,Logan.

483
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,330
My sole is split.

484
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:03,640
I think we promoted you
a little too soon,son.

485
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,280
We gotta get out of here.

486
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,380
Targets are down.

487
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:25,480
Copy that.

488
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:28,030
Meet you at the rally point.

489
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:30,100
Nice work.

490
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,180
Okay,let's go,sweetie.

491
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:57,670
We don't want to keep
that driver waiting.

492
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,860
It's me.

493
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:07,600
It's over. We did it.

494
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,400
Never lost faith that
you could pull it off.

495
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:13,260
See you when you get back.

496
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,350
Looks like Aunt Leslie has the flu.

497
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:32,440
So,we won't be taking
that trip,after all.

498
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,870
Really?

499
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:37,100
But I'll make it up to
you with some ice cream.

500
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,570
Come on.

501
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:42,080
Then we'll go to the
park,and then to the library!

502
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:51,200
They've been up there all day.

503
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:56,090
- So,did you...
- Yes.

504
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,540
We saved him.

505
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:30,350
- Mom.
- Sweetheart.

506
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:44,920
- Where were you? Are you okay?
- Yeah,I'm fine.

507
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,930
- You helped them?
- Yeah,Samantha got them for me.

508
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:54,610
She says hi.

509
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:01,610
What are you guys talking about?

510
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:04,340
Nothing important,sweetheart.

511
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,350
I can't believe you did it.

512
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:19,600
No.

513
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,700
We did it.

514
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:25,770
You came through for me,Ellen.

515
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:33,590
Without you,I don't know what
would have happened today.

516
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,770
Well,I want you to know...

517
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:43,410
I'm ready.

518
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,730
To kill the president?

519
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,000
Thank you.

520
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,010
Thank you.

521
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,980
Don't move!

522
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:46,370
