然后攻其软肋
and we attack their weak spot.

54
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,840
斯考特・梅尔・金森有糖尿病

67
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,350
因为他想当公主  而我要阻止他
Because he wanted to be a princess and I wouldn't let him.

68

00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,230
但是你们马上就要了
Well, you're about to be.

138
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,730
那我们要是走得特别特别慢呢
Well, what if we just walk really, really slow.

139
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:36,310
黑色星期五
Black Friday.

140
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,700
你们得走得再慢一些
You gonna have to walk slower than that.

141
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,090
还很有点时间呢
You get a while.

142
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,330
我们可以走得非常慢的  瞧
We can walk really slow, look.

143
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,410
自作聪明
Smart asses.

144
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,390
巴特斯圣骑士
Paladin Butters,

145
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,780
我正想要和你谈谈麦考密克夫人
I was hoping I could talk to you about Lady McKormick.

146
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,280
您是指肯尼公主吗  大人
You mean Princess Kenny, my lord?

147
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,320
是的  随便啦
Yeah, whatever.

148
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,370
那个小鸡巴以为自己是丹妮莉丝・坦格利安
That little prick thinks he's Daenerys Targaryen.

149
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,190
我要知道如何才能解决掉他
I need to know how do they deal with him?

150
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,130
在《权力的游戏》里
How did they deal with

151
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,570
他们是怎么解决龙族女王的
the queen of dragons in Game of Thrones?

152
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:05,760
他们没有
They don't!

153
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:08,130
什么  你有没有照我说的看完第三季
Well, did you finish watching Season 3 like I asked you?

154
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,550
我看完了
Yeah, I have finished it.

155
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:10,820
那么龙出现时发生了什么
So, what happens when the dragons show up?

156
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:11,720
什么都没发生
Nothing!

157
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,700
龙还在路上呢
The dragons are still on their way.

158
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,080
他们不停说会有龙
They keep promising dragons

159
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,290
但我只看到软趴趴的鸡鸡
but all I get are more floppy wieners in my face.

160
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:18,990
巴特斯  胜利的关键
BUtters, the key to our victory

161
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:21,540
就是要紧随《权力的游戏》的剧情
is following the Game of Thrones model exactly.

162
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,100
我要知道龙出现后发生了什么
I have to know what happens when dragons show up,

163
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,650
这样我就知道怎么解决肯尼了
so I know how to deal with Kenny.

164
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,220
那你要我怎样呢
What do you want me to do?

165
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,930
这里有两张去新墨西哥州的车票
Here's two bus tickets to New Mexico.

166
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,620
我要你带上斯科特・ 马尔金森爵士
I want you to take Sir Scott Malkinson,

167
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,410
然后找乔治・马丁问到答案
and go seek out George R. R. Martin for answers.

168
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,900
乔治・马丁是谁
Who is George R. R. Martin?

169
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,880
巴特斯  他就是《权力的游戏》的作者
He's the guy who write Game of Thrones, Butters.

170
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,960
他可以告诉我们要如何解决掉肯尼
He can let us both know how to handle Kenny

171
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,730
还有我们是否该出卖克莱德
and if we should betray Clyde or not.

172
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:40,750
面对现实吧  巴特斯
Let's face it, Butters.

173
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,200
这其实就只关于你和我得到Xbox
This is really about you and me getting Xboxes.

174
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,160
其他人的存在只是为了
The rest are simply there

175
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,950
帮我们进入那几扇门罢了
to help us get through the doors.

176
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,070
我说了让你们滚出我家后院的
I told you kids to stay out of my damn yard.

177
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,140
回避下好吗  我们正说话呢
Do you mind? We're trying to talk here.

178
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,700
为什么每次你和别人说话
Yeah? Well how come every time you talk to somebody

179
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,820
都是在讲出卖另一个人的事
it's about betraying somebody else.

180
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,560
要你多管闲事
Why don't you mind your own business.

181
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,710
最后听好了
No, listen for the last time

182
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:05,200
我们无龙可派
we don't have any dragons to send them.

183
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:08,470
要是有人想要PS  那是他们的选择
If some people want to choose Playstations it's their choice.

184
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,950
先生  盖茨先生来了
Sir, Mr. Gates is here.

185
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:12,130
比尔・盖茨吗
Bill Gates?

186
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:13,320
我得挂了
I got to go.

187
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:18,110
比尔・盖茨居然到公司来了
Hey, Bill Gates actually showing up at corporate.

188
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,310
史蒂夫  最近如何
Hey Steve, how you doing?

189
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:19,980
不错
Not bad.

190
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,730
正要处理些媒体的事情
You know, just trying to get the next gen press stuff handled.

191
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:25,610
我听说在科罗拉多州某地出了点小状况
I heard there's a little trouble in Colorado some where?

192
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:27,250
没有  没什么大事
Oh, it's not. Turns out it was nothing.

193
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,270
就是一帮小屁孩
Just some kids're trying to

194
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,220
想把主机之争弄得更大
turn the console wars into something bigger.

195
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,240
我的天呐
Oh, my gosh.

196
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,800
史蒂夫  你知道当我退下来
You know when I stepped down

197
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,240
并决定让你负责公司时
and left you in charge of the company Steve,

198
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,370
我知道可能对你来说是个挑战
I knew there might be some challenges for you.

199
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:38,140
没有什么我解决不了的
Well, yeah. Nothing I can't handle.

200
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,400
我们可能需要改变营销策略
There may be some changes we need to make to our marketing,

201
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,260
但我还是很乐观的
but I'm optimistic.

202
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:44,920
我想我们最终可以达到预计的销量的
I think we will ultimately sell the number of units we want to.

203
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,190
没错  史蒂夫  是需要做出些改变了
You're right, Steve. Some changes do need to be made.

204
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,630
你知道弱点是什么吗  史蒂夫
Do you know what weakness is, Steve?

205
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,490
那就是相信竞争是良性的
Weakness is believes competion is healthy.

206
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,280
曾经Xbox和PS确实
See, there was a time when Xboxes and Playstations

207
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,690
可以共存
can both servive in this world.

208
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:09,440
但那段时光结束了
But that time is done.

209
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,510
现在的趋势是
It's all headed to one device

210
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:14,780
人们在同一平台上游戏  看电视和社交
that people game on, watch TV on, socialise on.

211
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:17,520
只会有一个胜利者
There's only going to be one winner.

212
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,690
我不能让你们这帮蠢货
I can't have you idiots throwing away

213
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:22,160
毁了我千辛万苦才得来的一切
everything I worked so hard to achieve.

214
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,840
把他处理掉
Clean that shit up.

215
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,200
快点  斯科特  你太慢了
Come on, Scott, you're lagging.

216
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,440
我觉得我的胰岛素偏低  我得吃东西
I think my insulin is low, I need to eat.

217
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,170
那我们就赶紧干完正事儿了去麦当劳
Let's just talk to this guy and then we can hit an McDonalds.

218
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,570
到了  2217
Here we go, 2217.

219
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,380
你们找谁
Can I help you?

220
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,170
你好
Hello?

221
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:45,580
这里是乔治・ 马丁家吗
Is this George R. R. Martin's house?

222
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,060
请问你们是谁
Who is this, please?

223
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,570
两个想知道
Two kids that want to know

224
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:50,310
龙出现后的剧情的小孩
what happens when the dragons show up?

225
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:52,790
在吗
Hello?

226
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:55,580
对不起  但是马丁先生不见粉丝
I'm sorry but Mr. Martin does not see fans.

227
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:56,710
我们不是粉丝
We're not fans.

228
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,920
我们根本不喜欢
Yeah. We don't like it.

229
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,780
根本就不喜欢
We don't like it.

230
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,110
而且说实话我非常讨厌这部剧
And I'm pretty pissed off if you want to know the truth.

231
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,270
为什么
About what?

232
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,310
让我进去见乔治・马丁  我再告诉他
Let me talk to George R. R. Martin and I'll tell him about what.

233
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,240
都怪血色婚礼  是吧
It's the red wedding, isn't it?

234
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,140
你们是恨我把所有人都杀了吧
You hate how I killed everyone off?

235
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:19,110
不是  我们只是要了解龙的剧情
No, sir. We just really need to know about the dragons

236
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,720
但是它们根本没出现
but they never seem to show up.

237
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,500
它们会来的
They're coming.

238
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,050
龙已经在路上了
The dragons are on their way.

239
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:23,650
啥时候到
When?

240
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:24,850
你们真的想知道吗
You really want to know?

241
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,650
求你了  很着急
Please. It's urgent.

242
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:27,520
好吧
All right.

243
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,710
乔佛里国王仍在君临城
King Joffrey is still in king's landing.

244
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,430
但有一个年轻的铁匠
But there's a young black smith

245
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,580
一天早上起来想到了一个主意
who wakes up one morning with a plan,

246
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:36,440
他的鸡鸡软软地挂在两腿之间
and his wiener gently hangs down between his legs.

247
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,550
他软趴趴的鸡鸡在晨光中熠熠生辉
Soft and flaccid, his wiener glistened in the golden sun slight.

248
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:42,630
停  能不能跳过鸡鸡的部分直接说龙
No. Can we skip the wiener stuff and get to the dragons?

249
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:45,410
糟糕  我觉得我要晕了
Oh shit. I think I'm going faint.

250
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:46,510
怎么了  斯科特
What's the matter, Scott?

251
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:48,870
我说了我每两个小时就得吃东西
I told you I have to eat every two hours.

252
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,170
他有糖尿病
He's diabetic.

253
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:51,340
天啊  你
Oh gee. You--

254
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,790
孩子们进来暖和下吧
Why don't you kids come out the cold?

255
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,090
我来定披萨
I will order some pizzas.

256
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,530
噢  好  谢谢
Oh, ok. Thanks.

257
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,420
进来吧
Come on in and I'll tell you

258
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,930
我会告诉你们《权力的游戏》后面的剧情
everything that gonna happen in Game of Thrones.

259
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,840
凯尔爵士  我想跟你聊聊斯坦
Sir Kyle I wanted to talk to you about Stan.

260
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,810
卡特曼  如果你是想确定我不会叛变
If you want to make sure I'm not switching sides, Cartman,

261
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:10,800
就没什么好担心的了
you don't have to worry.

262
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,090
斯坦错了
Stan is wrong.

263
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,120
不是这事
It isn't that.

264
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,680
肯尼公主深受她军队的爱戴
Princess Kenny is loved by her army

265
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,320
而斯坦却疯狂追随她的指挥
but Stan is still nuts as balls of her operation.

266
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:20,120
一事就可阻碍叛徒们得到PS
It would be a huge set back to the trators getting their Play Stations

267
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,040
就是让斯坦被禁足
if Stan were to be grounded.

268
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,450
因为什么被禁足
Gounded for what?

269
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,440
那就看你的了
That could be up to you.

270
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,070
不  你说过没人会被禁足
No. Cartman, you said nobody would have to be grounded.

271
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:30,470
我们不玩阴的
We're not playing dirty.

272
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,610
那好吧  凯尔爵士
Fine, Sir Kyle.

273
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,000
也许你是对的
Perhaps you're right.

274
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:35,990
你知道斯坦他爸在商场安保兼职吗
Did you know that Stan's dad is working a temp job at mall security

275
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:36,840
什么
What?

276
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,460
看起来还挺方便  不是么
It seems a little convenient, doesn't it?

277
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:41,540
斯坦有内线可以帮他搞到PS4
Stan will have somebody inside to help him get PS4s.

278
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,120
现在又是谁玩阴的了
Who's playing dirty now?

279
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,160
直说吧  凯尔爵士
Let's face it, Sir Kyle.

280
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,650
这只关乎于你和我得到Xbox
This is all about you and me getting Xboxes.

281
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,480
其他人都只是我们的垫脚石而已
The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors.

282
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,240
别信他
Don't believe it.

283
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,230
他跟一堆人这么说过了
He said that to a bunch of people.

284
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,690
哥们  你再骚扰我就报警啦
Dude, you better stop harassing me or I'm calling the cops.

285
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,130
你报警
You're calling the cops?

286
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:01,880
-是  -你私闯民宅我才要报警
- Yeah. - You're on my property. I'm calling the cops.

287
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,130
那你他妈倒是报啊
Then call the fucking cops then.

288
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,350
2012年日间新闻最佳奖

289
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,810
噢  是你啊
Oh, it's you.

290
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,570
汤姆  我站在你家走廊上是因为
Tom, I'm standing in your doorway

291
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,250
我们有个大新闻要报道
because we have a hot news story to report.

292
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,700
我们还有一小时才开工呢
We don't go to work for another hour.

293
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,960
我们才接到比尔・盖茨的来电
We just got a call from Bill Gates.

294
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,850
他保证黑色星期五能掀起大战
He says he can promise us a bigger war on Black Friday

295
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,630
只要我们合作的话
if we play along.

296
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:31,460
他想拉拢我们吗
He wants us to side with him?

297
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,590
没错  塔米
That's right, Tammy.

298
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,960
别忘了
Let's not forget having

299
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,830
黑色星期五的血战会是超好的题材
a blood bath on Black Friday is good for the news.

300
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,270
是有益于我们的
It's good for us.

301
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,560
越严重越好
The bigger the better.

302
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,000
我们旨在播报新闻而不是让它更暴力
Our job is to report the news not make it more violent?

303
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,760
真对  汤姆  你这人太正直了
Right, Tom, because you're so about integrity.

304
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,160
快走
Let's go.

305
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,950
也许我应该跟新闻间里的
Maybe I should let everyone in

306
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:52,770
所有人说他们的两位主播在干嘛
the news room know what their two anchors are up to.

307
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,680
没的说了吧
Back to you.

黑色星期五就要到来

312
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:07,620
塔米  现在局面更加紧张了
Tammy, it's getting fierce out there.

313
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,360
没错  
That's right.

314
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,720
奈尔斯・劳森正带着节日惊喜等在商场外
Niles Lawson is at the mall with a a little holiday surprise.

315
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,010
塔米  黑色星期五的热情已达到巅峰
Tammy, the excitement over Black Friday is peaking and

316
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:18,890
现在比尔・盖茨本人现身想助一臂之力
now Bill Gates himself has shown up to try to make it even bigger.

317
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:19,670
没错
That's right.

318
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:22,620
我们想要尽可能帮助我们的拥护者
We want to do whatever we can to help our supporters get

319
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,060
在周五拿到超值的Xbox折扣
their Xboxes at incredible deals on Friday,

320
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,520
所以我们提供了宝剑和战斧
so we've come to offer swords and battle axes,

321
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,970
所有轻便并能帮孩子们杀出条血路的武器
whatever the kids can carry to fight their way through other shoppers.

322
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:34,000
据悉你们还给孩子们捐赠了枪支
We understand you've donated some guns to the kids as well.

323
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,360
是的  但仅限拥护者人手一支
Yes, but we are limited one per Xbox follower

324
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,410
因为最重要的还是安全
because the key thing here on everyone's mind is safety.

325
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:57,170
找哪位
Yes?

326
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,180
肯尼在家吗
Hi, is Kenny home?

327
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:03,060
他在后院和朋友们玩呢
Yeah, Kenny's out back playing with his friends.

328
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,410
前进  勇士们
Forward, men.

329
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,630
这
That--um--

330
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,280
你们转一下
You guys turn me.

331
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,340
敌人来了
It's the enemy.

332
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,780
准  准  准备防御
Defense p--p--positions

333
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,770
出去
Get--

334
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,590
快点儿  滚出去
Come on. Get out.

335
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:23,570
我看到了护法们和麦考密克公主
I see guardians with the traitor Lady McKormick.

336
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,120
让他们过来
Let them pass.

337
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,500
公主欢迎大肥猪来访我国
The Princess bids your fat ass welcome

338
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,110
并要你呈上来访目的
to our kingdom and suggests you state your purpose.

339
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,820
你打不过这些人的
You can't win these guys.

340
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,020
看看周围
Look around you.

341
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,630
放下武器
Lay down your weapons and

342
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:46,640
回来与我们为Xbox而战吧
come back fight for Xboxes with us on Black Friday.

343
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,220
公主说如果你想改变主意
The Princess says that if you want to change

344
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:54,500
并承认PS更好  她就会考虑
your mind and agree that Play Stations are better she'll consider it.

345
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,130
肯尼  我们都有想扮小妞的时候
Kenny, we all understand wanting to play as a chick once in a while,

346
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:01,920
但你永远都不可能是真的公主
but you're never going to be a real Princess.

347
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,870
公主说你是舔蛋蛋的拉拉
The Princess calls you a ball-licking lesbian.

348
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,600
那压根都不合逻辑
That doesn't even make sense.

349
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,650
斯坦  这太过分了
Stan, this has gone too far.

350
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:14,000
人们会受到伤害的
People are going to get hurt.

351
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,260
你所发起的已经完全失控了
What you started is way out of control.

352
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,300
什么我发起的
What I started?

353
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,360
你怎么敢这么说
How dare you.

354
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,420
所有人都将会玩Xbox
All these people will be gaming on Xboxes.

355
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,950
你真想余生都只跟克雷格玩么
You really want to just game with Craig the rest of your life?

356
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:24,820
我宁愿跟克雷格玩
I'd rather game with Craig

357
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:28,010
也不想花一分钟建Xbox账号
than spend one minute having to set up a Xbox live account.

358
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,900
我们明天会得到PS的
We'll get our Play Stations tomorrow,

359
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,860
而你们这帮傻逼什么都得不到
and you buttholes will have nothing.

360
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,490
你们以寡敌众  而且也没时间了
You're outnumbered 10 to 1 and there's no time left.

361
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:36,960
怎么赢
How will you win?

362
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,600
神会指引我们的
The gods will find us a way.

363
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,120
然后山姆威尔・塔利看到军队来了
So, then Samwell Tarly sees the army approaching,

364
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,340
他的小鸡鸡大概有这么大
and his wiener is about this big.

365
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,780
他知道史坦尼斯・拜拉席恩的鸡鸡
He knows that Stannis Baratheon's weiner

366
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,920
可能已经冻小了
probably shrivel from the cold.

367
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,100
山姆威尔要召集勇士  怎么办呢
Samwell has to rally his men. So what does he do?

368
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,880
他拿出他的小鸡鸡
He takes out his wiener

369
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:00,110
然后在所有人面前晃来晃去
and he dangles it around for all his men to see.

370
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,580
先生  你刚才说披萨要到了
Sir, you said pizzas were coming.

371
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,820
对  对  在路上了
Yeah, yeah. They're on their way.

372
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,870
一会就到了
They're still coming.

373
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,800
于是山姆威尔的鸡鸡...
So Samwell's wiener goes--

374
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,800
可你说快到了说了三个小时了
But you said they were on their way like three hours ago.

375
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,290
披萨再不来我就倒地不起了
If I don't get pizza soon, I'm going to pass out.

376
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:16,680
别急  就快到了
Don't worry, they're coming.

377
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,690
披萨在路上了  会很好吃的
Pizzas are on their way and they're going to be amazing.

378
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:20,220
下面  
Now,

379
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,710
琼恩・雪诺终于遇上了詹姆・兰尼斯特
Jon Snow finally faces Jaime Lannister,

380
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:25,460
这家伙的鸡鸡  超级大
And this guy's weiner is, you know, huge, right?

381
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,760
所以没那么简单
So it's not going to be easy.

382
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:35,200
盖茨先生  我想跟你谈谈星期五的大战
Mr. Gates, I was hoping I could talk to you about the fight tomorrow.

383
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,790
没问题  是埃里克吧
Certainly. Uh, Eric, right?

384
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,860
应该是巫师国王大人
It's my lord wizard king, actually.

385
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,740
你来作为领导人当然很有帮助
Having your leadership has certainly been a help,

386
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,870
但我希望我们讲清楚这是我的军队
but I hope that we're clear that this is my army.

387
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,430
王权只能掌握在一人手里
There can only be one person of royalty.

388
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,790
这是一种定数
That's kind of the ruse.

389
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:50,270
我当然不会侵犯你的权力
I certainly don't want to step on your toes.

390
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,260
别担心  
Don't worry,

391
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:54,440
我很擅长让我的CEO做自己的决策
I'm quite good at letting my CEOs do what they want.

392
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:55,620
你的CEO
Your CEOs?

393
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:59,350
直说吧  只有我们两个可能拿到xbox
Let's face it-- this is really just about you and me getting xboxes.

394
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:03,430
其他人都是我们的垫脚石而已
The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors.

395
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:05,990
什么
What?

396
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,470
感觉如何呀
How's it feel?

397
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:10,590
现在谁是老大谁是小弟了
Now who's walking who through the betrayal garden?

398
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,880
你他妈就不能少管闲事吗
Why don't you stay the fuck out of my business?

399
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,570
你他妈就不能滚出我家院子吗
Why don't you stay the fuck out of my yard?

400
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,610
刚刚的啪啪让我欲仙欲死
That was amazing sex. I enjoyed it immensely.

401
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:29,920
不知你感觉如何
How about you?

402
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:32,380
[日语]

403
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:35,030
对于想在黑色星期五
You know, Microsoft has given kids

404
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:38,580
得到xbox的孩子们  微软给了很多帮助
who want xboxes on black Friday a lot of support.

405
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:42,220
战况如此一边倒似乎是一种耻辱
Seems a shame that the fight will be so one-sided.

406
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,640
[日语]

407
