1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,200
我觉得你丈夫调查的事情仍在进行
I think Something your husband was investigating could still be in play.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,600
所以这有可能和他被谋杀有关系?
So this could have something to do with his murder?

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,320
这是詹姆斯・林 是吗?
Well, that's James Lim, right?

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,200
他是个商人
He's a businessman on his way up.

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,000
还有他兄弟林杰志是资深的工会领袖
Oh, and his brother's Lim Chee Kit, the senior union leader.

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,880
关于温斯顿的谋杀案 李库方是嫌疑人之一
Winston's murder... Lee-Kum Fong was one of the suspects.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,480
当晚有人看见他在现场
He was seen in the area that night.

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,680
请代我问候郑夫人
Please pass on my respects to Mrs Cheng.

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,920
温斯顿在这个社区很受人尊敬
Winston was a much respected man in this community

10
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,560
他的死也是我们的损失
and her loss is our loss.

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,720
我生了他的孩子 是个男孩 现在已经四岁了
I had his baby. A boy. He's four now.

12
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,400
你要我为你在中情局做间谍?
You want me to spy on the CIA for you?

13
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,640
我得闯进怀尔德・比尔的办公室
I'd have to break into Wild Bill's office.

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,800
这个任务对你来说肯定不在话下
A challenge surely within your skill set.

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,920
弗兰克 我喜欢上别人了 我要搬出去了
Frank, I've met someone. I'm moving out.

16
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,480
这行不通的 你不属于这里
It's not gonna work. You don't belong here.

17
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,360
别离开弗兰克 你还没告诉他吧?
Don't leave Frank. You haven't told him yet?

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,680
接下来 就是所谓的外交事件了
Now, there's what you call a diplomatic incident.

19
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,680
要是你想跟小白脸鬼混
If you're going to go wild with the pool boy,

20
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,960
老天 可千万别告诉你丈夫
for God's sake don't tell the husband.

21
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,000
你在看什么呢?
What are you looking at?

22
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,520
你以前没见过我下厨吗?
You've never seen me cook before?

23
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,240
我正要出去 看不了多久了
Just heading out. I won't be long.

24
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,946
你要去哪? 
Wait. Where are you going? 

25
00:01:50,947 --> 00:01:53,040
见个客户 我没跟你说吗?
A client. Didn't I tell you?

26
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,680
没有啊 你姐姐和你侄女要来
No, you didn't. Your sister is coming with your niece.

27
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,440
- 你得待在家 - 亲爱的 我必须去
- You have to stay. - Baby, I have to go.

28
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,120
这件事非常重要
This is really important.

29
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,840
做好我最爱的蛋羹 我会在九点的时候回来
Make my favourite egg custard. I'll be back at nine.

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,960
你知道我吃蛋羹的时候会发生什么
You know what happens when I eat your custard.

31
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,240
打扮一下 我们去拉斐尔跳个通宵
Dress up and we'll go to Raffles and dance all night.

32
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,840
你能把黄莺带进来吗?
Oh, can you bring the songbirds in?

33
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,520
我会带进来 然后煮了它们当晚饭
I'll bring the songbirds in and I'll cook them for dinner.

34
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,200
我爱你 希望你相信这一点
I love you. I hope you have no doubts about that.

35
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,600
走吧! 走走走
Go on! Just go.

36
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,000
九点前要回来哦
Be back before nine, now.

37
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:52,990
石龙岗之路 第一季第10集


38
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,840
我不知道你是怎么想的 你竟然放了他
I don't know what you think you're gonna get out of him.

39
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,560
- 他不会坦白的 - 为什么?
- He won't just confess. - Why not?

40
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,072
他已经参加过一次谋杀了 
He's already up for one murder. 

41
00:05:04,073 --> 00:05:05,200
他们又不会吊死他两次
They won't hang him twice.

42
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,974
要是他坦白自己杀了温斯顿 
He could do a deal with his lawyer 

43
00:05:06,975 --> 00:05:08,320
他可以和律师做个交易
if he confesses to killing Winston.

44
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,170
他们可以帮他免除死刑 
They could waive the death penalty. 

45
00:05:10,171 --> 00:05:11,400
郑夫人会同意吗?
Is that what Mrs Cheng wants?

46
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,000
让杀她丈夫的凶手免于死刑?
Her husband's killer not to hang?

47
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,040
另外 我们也不是很确定他就是凶手
Besides, we're not too sure he's the killer.

48
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,580
他还只是嫌疑人  
He's still a suspect.  

49
00:05:16,581 --> 00:05:17,960
让我们弄个水落石出
Let's find out.

50
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,760
他在哪?
Where is he?

51
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,760
李库方人呢?

52
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,640
我们知道郑叔叔曾为他的生命担忧
So, we know Uncle Cheng feared for his life

53
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,280
他也意识到自己被跟踪了
and he was being followed.

54
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,920
而且 这个案子的文件也丢了
Also, the case file's missing.

55
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,720
现在方出狱了 有人保释了他
And now Fong's been let out of jail, so someone put up the bail,

56
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,240
但他的律师不会说是谁保释的
but his lawyer won't say who.

57
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,080
有人在保护他而且试图隐藏什么
Someone is trying to hide something and is protecting him.

58
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,339
那现在怎么办? 
So now what? 

59
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,400
我们怎么找出当事人和他的目的?
How do we find out who or why?

60
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,920
我们要查出那天晚上他见的是谁
We've got to find out who he was meeting that night.

61
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,840
也许我们可以回想他的路线
Maybe we can retrace his footsteps.

62
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
他傍晚的时候去见了一个客户
Well, he left just on dark to meet with a client.

63
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,160
是的 我记得 他带着公文包
Yeah, I remember. He had a briefcase.

64
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,560
山姆 你忙吗?
Sam, are you busy?

65
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,240
我要去取点东西 然后去见康 怎么了?
Got to pick something up. Then I'm meeting Kang. Why?

66
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,720
- 没什么 - 要帮忙吗?
- That's fine. - Need a hand?

67
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,920
就是有个会 没什么事
It's just a meeting. It's fine.

68
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,818
只是... 看起来没什么危险 
It just... it didn't seem dangerous.  

69
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:23,320
没提到什么会议
No mention of a meeting.

70
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,720
- 其实我们知道他先去了哪里 - 哪里?
- We do know where he went first. - Where?

71
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,640
- 他去见了一个... 朋友 - 谁?
- He went to see a... friend. - Who?

72
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,800
你温斯顿叔叔... 还有一个家庭
Your Uncle Winston... had another family.

73
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,240
什么?
What?

74
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,880
- 阿姨 对不起 - 没事
- Aunty, I'm so sorry. - Yeah.

75
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,560
阿姨
Aunty.

76
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,480
- 他喜欢新学校吗? - 很喜欢 谢谢你
- How does he like his new school? - He loves it. Thank you.

77
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,640
希望打疫苗不会很痛
And the vaccine I hope didn't hurt him too much.

78
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,160
美玲 我们过来是因为
Mei Ling, we're here because we need to

79
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,280
我们要追溯温斯顿去世前的事情
trace back Winston's last moments.

80
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,560
你能想起什么吗?
Can you think of anything?

81
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,080
他要去见一个客户
He was meeting with a client

82
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,880
但我们不确定他有没有见到
but we're just not sure whether he met with him or not.

83
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,480
嗯 他确实说要去见一个人
Well, he did say he was meeting someone.

84
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:24,040
所以不能留在这 我当时很生气
That's why he couldn't stay. I got really upset.

85
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,840
就这时候他给了我这块表
That's when he gave me the watch.

86
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,800
要是出了什么意外 把这个给我妻子
If something goes wrong, give this to my wife.

87
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,280
我知道这要求有点过分
I know that's a lot to ask.

88
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,160
确实很过分
That is a lot to ask.

89
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,160
他拿着一个棕色的文件袋和一些照片
So a brown folder and some photographs.

90
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,680
你知道他走的时候往哪里走了吗?
Did you see which way he went when he left?

91
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,920
他是... 走着还是坐人力车?
Did he... did he walk or take a rickshaw?

92
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,960
我不知道这有没有帮助
Well, I don't know if it helps,

93
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,200
但他说过要是事情顺利的话
but he did say if things went well,

94
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,000
他去德霖路那家店买我最喜欢的蛋糕
he would buy me my favourite cakes from the shop at Teck Lim Road.

95
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,440
就是这家店 温斯顿经常来的
Well, that's the shop, alright. Winston came here all the time.

96
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,280
但她不记得那晚他来了没有
But she can't remember whether he was here that night, though.

97
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,760
已经过去太久了
It's been so long.

98
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:36,880
- 你还好吗?  - 嗯 我还好
- You alright? - Yeah. I'm alright.

99
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,320
如果他在角落里或者在店外面见的客户
Well, if he met the client at a corner or outside a shop,

100
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,880
那就无踪可寻了
there'd be no trace.

101
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,080
温斯顿有最喜欢的咖啡店或者是餐厅吗?
Did Winston have a favourite kopi shop or restaurant?

102
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,800
我不确定
I'm not sure.

103
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,360
如果他在餐厅或者咖啡店里见的面
If he met inside a restaurant or kopitiam,

104
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,080
没人会记得
no one would remember.

105
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,840
- 德霖路 - 什么?
- Teck Lim Road. - What?

106
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,920
德霖路 工会办公室就在德霖路上
Teck Lim Road. The Trade Union office on Teck Lim Road.

107
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,600
齐基特的办公室 齐基特和温斯顿认识
Chee Kit's office. Chee Kit and Winston knew each other.

108
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,640
- 有可能齐基特就是这个客户 - 有可能
- Perhaps Chee Kit is the client. - It's gotta be.

109
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,193
为什么我要告诉你?  
Why should I tell you anything?  

110
00:09:56,194 --> 00:09:57,440
你不会有任何损失
You've got nothing to lose.

111
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,911
你弟弟还是想你死  
Your brother still wants you dead. 

112
00:09:59,912 --> 00:10:01,760
不用考虑我弟弟了
My brother does not concern you.

113
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,187
告诉我 你为谁工作?  
But tell me,who do you work for?  

114
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,640
帕特丽夏・郑
Patricia Cheng.

115
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,400
你雇佣了她的丈夫 温斯顿
You hired her husband, Winston.

116
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,720
他被杀的那晚你在德霖路的工会办公室
Did you meet with him the night he was killed

117
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,640
和他见过面吗?
at the Trade Union office on Teck Lim Road?

118
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,240
没有 他一直没出现
No. He never turned up.

119
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,640
第二天 我就听说他在一场抢劫中被杀了
And the next day, I heard he was killed in a robbery.

120
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,720
- 你相信吗? - 这也是有可能的
- Do you believe that? - It wasn't impossible.

121
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,840
你在调查谁?
Who were you investigating?

122
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:44,320
我觉得我弟弟和一些危险人物有关系
I believe my brother was involved with some dangerous people.

123
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,278
我只是想知道  
I just wanted to know.  

124
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:49,200
所以你让温斯顿跟踪詹姆士?
So you had Winston follow James?

125
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,960
- 你也不会出现在客户名单上? - 对
- You were never listed as a client? - No.

126
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,380
温斯顿 他有自己的方法 
Winston, he had a system. 

127
00:10:56,381 --> 00:10:59,640
把我的案子写成不忠的案例
He wrote it up as an infidelity case.

128
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:04,760
当然 他自己真的有外遇 情况很复杂
Of course, he was actually having an affair, which complicated things,

129
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:09,840
但我对他的外遇不感兴趣
but I wasn't interested in his affairs with women.

130
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,960
我想知道他跟其他人的会面
I wanted to know about his other meetings.

131
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,160
所以当晚他是去送照片的?
So he was delivering photographs that night?

132
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,880
是的
Yes.

133
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,520
但不知为什么我弟弟发现我在调查他
But somehow my brother found out that I was investigating him.

134
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:29,080
然后他雇人阻止了温斯顿
And he paid for someone to intercept Winston.

135
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,720
李库方 你认识他吗?
Lee Kum Fong, do you know him?

136
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,840
不认识
No.

137
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,203
那你从没看过任何照片? 
So you never saw any photographs? 

138
00:11:36,204 --> 00:11:38,040
你也不知道里面有谁?
You don't know who was in them?

139
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,440
不知道
No.

140
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,760
唯一知道真相的人就是我弟弟
The only one who can tell you is my brother,

141
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,960
但他为了保密已经杀过人了
but he has already killed once to keep it secret.

142
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,790
汤米 两杯咖啡

143
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,720
你好
Hello.

144
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,920
你知道有个叫詹姆斯・林的人吗?
What do you know about a guy called James Lim?

145
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,923
康拉德 我知道我们不该来问你 
Conrad, I know we shouldn't be asking you,

146
00:12:02,924 --> 00:12:04,440
但我们走投无路了
 but we're desperate.

147
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,080
我们实在需要找到杀害郑先生的凶手
We really need to find out who killed Mr Cheng.

148
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,080
如果我们不帮忙 郑太太会十分伤心
Mrs Cheng's miserable and if we don't help her,

149
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,520
她可能会把侦探所关了 然后我就失业了
she might close the agency and then I won't have a job

150
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,320
这样的话我父母就会有理由
and my parents will finally be able to marry me off

151
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,400
把我嫁给某个年轻有为的土生华人了
to some nice young rich Peranakan boy.

152
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,200
我就没法和我心爱的人...
And then I won't be able to go to America...

153
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,560
...一起去美国了
...with the love of my life.

154
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,720
汤米?
Tommy?

155
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,280
你刚才说他老婆很好喝
You told him his wife tastes sweet.

156
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,120
- 这个人叫什么来着? - 詹姆斯・林
- What's this guy's name again? - James Lim.

157
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,560
詹姆斯・林
James Lim.

158
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,720
哈里森 有空跟你说两句吗?
Harrison, you got a minute?

159
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,440
当然啦
Yeah, sure.

160
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,880
听着 我不知道怎样说这件事才好
Look, there's no easy way to say this,

161
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,760
所以我就开门见山好了
so I'm just gonna come right out with it.

162
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,480
月度报告送回总部了
The monthly report's back to HQ.

163
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,320
我建议他们把你安排到别的地方
I'm recommending they post you somewhere else.

164
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,000
为什么?
Why?

165
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,680
有人把机密情报泄露给英国人
Someone's leaking confidential reports to the Brits.

166
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,480
我们跟军情六处互相交换信息啊
Well, we talk to MI6, they talk to us.

167
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,560
我们给的情报他们都已经知道了
We give them stuff that they already know.

168
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,560
除了越南的事
Not on Vietnam.

169
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,160
那份国家安全委员会
That National Security Council report

170
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,760
在周二午餐会议上的报告?
on the Tuesday lunch meetings?

171
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,760
没错
Mm-hmm.

172
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,617
总部只发给了亚洲分部 
HQ sent it only to the offices in Asia. 

173
00:13:40,618 --> 00:13:42,160
但现在伦敦的人也有了
Now London has it.

174
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,400
那也可能是从别的分部发过去的
Well, that could have come from any of those offices.

175
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,480
但不是的
But it didn't.

176
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,960
重要的不是你这么做了
It's not that you did it.

177
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,160
而是他拿什么威胁你让你这么做的
It's whatever he's got on you that made you do it.

178
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,560
你已经妥协了 我不能用你了
You're compromised. I can't use you.

179
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,600
每个人都有过分的时候 哈里森
Everyone crosses the line, Harrison,

180
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,200
但重要的是 每当你回头看
but it's important when you look back

181
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,800
至少你知道自己在干什么
you can at least still see it.

182
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:06,400
不管结果怎样 我希望你记住这一点
I hope you remember that, wherever you end up.

183
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,880
- 你好 弗兰克 - 我来跟你决斗
- G'day, Frank. - I came here to fight you.

184
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,720
你在说什么呢?
What are you talking about?

185
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,960
我知道你觉得很荒谬
I'm sure you think that's ridiculous.

186
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,040
但如果这是一个公平的世界
But if this was any sort of just world

187
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,040
有个男人爱着自己的妻子 照顾她
where a man who loved his wife and took care of her

188
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,040
从没想过妻子会背叛自己
and never, ever dreamed of cheating on her,

189
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,280
而另一个男人...
and another man...

190
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,160
如果这是一个公平的世界
If this was any sort of just world,

191
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,320
我会跟你决斗 并打败你
I would fight you and I would beat you.

192
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,840
然而在这个世界 像你这样的男人赢了
In this world, a man like you wins that fight.

193
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:11,480
像你这样的男人... 怎么了?
A man like you with... what?

194
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,280
你有什么好的能让我老婆选择你?
What have you got that my wife chooses you over me?

195
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,800
周五晚上 我们会永远离开新加坡
Friday night, we're leaving Singapore for good.

196
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:27,280
我们会乘船去欧洲 再也不回来了
We're going to Europe by ship and we're not coming back.

197
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,400
我理解
I understand.

198
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,640
不 你不理解
No, you really don't.

199
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:38,280
我要你在我们离开之前去见她 
I want you to go to her before we leave. 

200
00:15:38,281 --> 00:15:40,360
我要你跟她说清楚
I want you to make your case.

201
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,480
如果你爱着她 想让她一直快乐的话
If you love her in a way that will care for her forever,

202
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,080
你跟她说清楚
you tell her that.

203
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,120
弗兰克 我不会去的...
Frank, I'm not gonna...

204
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,720
如果克莱尔的心还在这儿的话
I'm not gonna spend the rest of my life with Claire

205
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,120
我是不会跟她共度余生的
if part of her never leaves here.

206
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,760
如果她选择了你 那她就跟你走
If she chooses you, she chooses you.

207
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,880
周五晚上之前你还有时间
You've got till Friday night.

208
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:22,320
- 詹姆斯・林 - 你对他了解有多少?
- James Lim. - What do you know about him?

209
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,480
我以为我们之间已经说清楚了
I thought our arrangement was clear.

210
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,080
当我问你要东西的时候 你就给我
When I ask you for something, I get it.

211
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,040
我不记得还说过要交换条件
I don't recall there being any quid pro quo.

212
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,800
现在不管你跟我老板说什么都不重要了
Right now it doesn't matter what you tell my boss

213
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,840
因为他就要炒掉我了
because he's about to terminate me.

214
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,931
所以我想要你的信息... 
So what I need from you... 

215
00:16:41,932 --> 00:16:43,120
是想找到他的把柄
I need some dirt on him

216
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,160
这样他们就会炒了他而不是我
so they get rid of him instead of me.

217
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,920
为什么你会特别选择詹姆斯・林?
What made you choose James Lim in particular?

218
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,720
山姆・卡拉汉想要了解他
Sam Callaghan wanted to know about him.

219
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,040
可我去找资料的时候 什么都没有
When I went to look at the file, the file's missing.

220
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,440
唯一能拿到的资料就是... 怀尔德・比尔
The only one with access to that... Wild Bill.

221
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,657
如果他在忙什么...  
So if he's up to something...  

222
00:16:58,658 --> 00:17:00,200
对啊 他现在忙死了
Oh, yes. He's up to his neck.

223
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,960
这对我来说有什么好处?
But what's in it for me?

224
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,400
华盛顿
Washington.

225
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,520
我没有把安委会文件里的东西都给你
I didn't give you everything that was in that NSC file.

226
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,320
现在 如果你想要给你老板剩下的资料
Now, if you're the guy that tells your bosses the rest,

227
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,308
告诉他们总统办公室里有哪些人 
tell them who's in the room with the President, 

228
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:17,440
谁是他的亲信
who's got his ear,

229
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,240
你会拿到本土调动的 我保证
you get that stateside transfer you want, guaranteed.

230
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,960
好啊 成交
Alright. I'm in.

231
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,040
差点忘了 还有一件事
Oh, I almost forgot. There's one more thing.

232
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,120
我要跟苏玲有关的所有资料 
I want the files on Su Ling. All copies.

233
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,680
我的天!
My, my!

234
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:43,840
宝贝小熊真的长大了 对吗?
Baby Bear really has grown up, hasn't he?

235
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,730
哈里森先生来电话了 
Mr Harrison called. 

236
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,720
说没有詹姆斯・林的资料
He said there was no file on James Lim.

237
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,240
扯淡 詹姆斯・林想要参与政治
That's bullshit. James Lim wants to get into politics.

238
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,920
天啊 他哥哥是被捕的工会领导
For God's sake, his brother's a jailed trade union leader

239
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,400
被指控参与炸弹袭击
accused of bombings.

240
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,373
他们连街上扫地的人的资料都有  
They've got files on streetsweepers.  

241
00:17:56,374 --> 00:17:57,280
他知道你会这么说
He knew you'd say that.

242
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,000
他说他们没有你想象的那么多情报来源
He said to say they don't have as many tentacles as you think.

243
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,120
我不相信他的话  
Well, I don't believe him.  

244
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:02,080
他为什么要撒谎呢?
Why would he lie?

245
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,360
所以整个新加坡
So he's the one man in the whole of Singapore

246
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,160
中情局唯一缺少他的文件?
the CIA doesn't have a file on?

247
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,680
他已经解释啦
Like he said.

248
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,440
阿姨 该停手了
Aunty, it's a sign to stop.

249
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,240
是么 它们只是鸟而已啊
Oh, yeah, they're just birds.

250
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,475
她要的话我随时帮她弄些 还能算便宜点 
I can get her some more, for cheap too. 

251
00:18:32,476 --> 00:18:33,240
弄只鸭也没问题
Maybe even throw in a duck.

252
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,760
再跟我说下整件事
Explain the whole thing to me again.

253
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,480
温斯顿当时在查詹姆斯・林
Winston was investigating James Lim.

254
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,280
我不知道他查到什么 但已经足以被灭口
I don't know what he found, but it was enough to get him killed.

255
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,980
钥匙 在哪里?

256
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,400
现在可能不太方便上去吧...
Maybe now's not such a good time to...

257
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,400
钥匙 在哪里?

258
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,480
林先生 一切可好?
Everything alright, Mr Lim?

259
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,320
那是李库方吧?
Oh. That was Lee Kum Fong?

260
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,600
他究竟要什么?
What the hell was he after?

261
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,200
我不知道 他刚在喊什么钥匙之类的
I don't know. He was saying something about a key.

262
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,880
喔 喔 算了吧
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Forget it.

263
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,360
他妈的
Come on.

264
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,680
怎么都弄不开这玩意
Never going to get this sucker open.

265
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,160
是啊
Nope.

266
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,720
- 你跟周怡在一块多久了? - 啥?
- How long have you been with Joo Ee? - Huh?

267
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,800
你觉得她就是你要找的吗?
Do you think she's the one?

268
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,560
兄弟 我要一辈子跟她在一起
Uh... I'm with that girl for life, man.

269
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,000
- 是么? - 是啊
-Yeah? - Yeah.

270
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,680
可你们俩就只会吵架啊
All you do is argue.

271
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,591
是啊 她爱喝酒 我爱赌博 
Sure. She drinks too much. I gamble too much. 

272
00:20:23,592 --> 00:20:25,920
她吼我 我们就打起来了
She yells at me. We fight.

273
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,400
我有的选么?
What's the alternative?

274
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,680
没她的日子 算了吧 
A life without her. Forget it, man.

275
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,960
世上只有一个周怡 我喜欢她 就喜欢她一个
There's only one Joo Ee, and I like her. There's nobody else.

276
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,880
妈的
Shit.

277
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,240
我想到了
I got an idea.

278
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,760
康我不懂这个
I don't know about this, Kang.

279
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,480
你觉不觉得我们放太多了?
You don't think we're using too much?

280
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,760
留着用来干嘛?
What else am I going to use this for?

281
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,280
别想太多啦
Yeah, don't think so much.

282
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,880
火灭了 它为什么会灭?
It went out. Why did it go out?

283
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,520
烂导线
Stupid old fuse.

284
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,960
康!
Kang!

285
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,280
康 你还好吗?
Kang, are you alright?

286
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,200
- 啊... - 你还好吧?
- Oh... - You're alright, yeah?

287
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,920
听得到我说话吗?
You hear me?

288
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,400
嘿 嘿 嘿 嘿
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

289
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,080
还真炸开了 你个疯子
That opened it, you bloody lunatic.

290
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,760
钱我能留着吧?
I can keep the money, right?

291
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,960
- 反正它们的主人已经死了 - 啥?
- It belongs to a dead man. - Huh?

292
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,680
今天真走运!
Today must be my lucky day.

293
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,040
这肯定是温斯顿的文件
There's no doubt it's Winston's file.

294
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,320
温斯顿叔叔说过
Uncle Winston used to say,

295
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:04,360
欲速则不达 照片它可不会着急
'No fuss, no rush. The picture won't hurry because you do.'

296
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,240
这张没什么
Nothing here.

297
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,560
- 这张也没有 - 拜托 我们要看到脸
- Nope. This one either. - Come on. We need a face.

298
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,320
下一张看起来有点不同
The next ones look different.

299
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,360
他是...
Is that...

300
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,440
怀尔德・比尔
Wild Bill.

301
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,680
詹姆斯・林... 在和中情局的人秘密会面
James Lim... is having a secret meeting with the CIA.

302
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,360
我不需要 谢谢 谢谢
No, not for me, thank you. Thank you.

303
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,440
康拉德骗了你
Conrad lied to you.

304
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,680
詹姆斯・林是中情局的线人
James Lim's a CIA informant.

305
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,360
一定有他的文件的
There's got to be a file on him.

306
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,840
你肯定找到了的
You must have found it.

307
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,040
- 事情没那么简单 - 就这么简单
- It's not that simple. - Yes, it is.

308
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,440
詹姆斯・林为中情局卖力 对吧?
James Lim works for the CIA, yes or no?

309
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,200
- 不是 - 好吧
- No. - Alright.

310
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,280
我要把所有事告诉阿姆兰
I'm going to take this whole thing to Amran.

311
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,560
新加坡警察对于中情局涉及谋杀
The Singaporean police would be most interested

312
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,120
一个正直的中国良民之事
in the CIA's involvement in the murder

313
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,920
肯定十分感兴趣
of an upstanding Chinese citizen.

314
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,840
詹姆斯・林不是为中情局做事
James Lim did not work for the CIA.

315
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,440
他是为怀尔德・比尔做事
He was working for Wild Bill.

316
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,880
胡说 怀尔德・比尔甚至都不负责那个领域
Bullshit. Wild Bill doesn't even work in the field.

317
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,920
正是 詹姆斯・林就是他的傀儡
Exactly. James Lim was his vanity case.

318
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,200
比尔在办公桌前呆不住 你知道的
Bill hates sitting behind a desk. You know that.

319
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,160
老是说他在别的什么地方
Always talking about being on the ground.

320
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,680
四十五岁时他在东德
45, he was in East Germany.

321
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,440
五十二岁时在和鲁塞尼亚人喝酒
52, he's drinking vodka with the Ruskies.

322
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,920
所以当詹姆斯・林出现时
So, when James Lim walked in,

323
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,960
比尔决定他要亲自秘密操纵詹姆士
Bill decided that he's going to run him himself under the radar.

324
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,040
所以他们就开始秘密会面了
So they start having these secret meetings.

325
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,240
怀尔德・比尔自己做案件记录
Wild Bill's taking all the case notes himself.

326
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,240
- 他们还达成交易 - 什么交易?
- They've got this deal. - What sort of deal?

327
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,280
我不知道
I don't know.

328
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,920
如果中情局想在这里建分局
If the CIA wanted to build a station here,

329
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,560
他们就需要有个新加坡联络人来保护这片土地
they'd need a Singaporean contact to secure the land.

330
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,840
拜托 山姆
Come on, Sam.

331
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,520
如果我知道那情报是真的
If I knew that information to be true,

332
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:08,080
你真以为我会告诉你吗?
you really think I'd be talking to you about it?

333
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,960
我只知道... 我也是从别人那打听到的
All I know ... and I got this second-hand 

334
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,240
詹姆斯・林去见怀尔德・比尔
is that James Lim went to see Wild Bill

335
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,080
是因为他觉得有个私家侦探在跟踪他
because he thought a private investigator was following him,

336
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,160
而且可能还拍了他们一起的照片
and there may be some photos of them together.

337
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,087
然后呢? 怀尔德・比尔做了什么?  
And? What did Wild Bill do? 

338
00:26:20,088 --> 00:26:21,088
我不知道
I don't know.

339
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,640
我真不知道
I don't.

340
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,120
那份文件不见了
The file's gone missing.

341
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,320
被人毁了
Someone destroyed it.

342
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,400
我们走吧
Let's go.

343
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,880
卡拉汉 你也玩五百吗?
You play 500, Callaghan?

344
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,480
我玩另一个游戏
I've had a game.

345
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,960
绅士的游戏
A gentleman's game.

346
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,880
不像扑克
Not like poker.

347
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,040
扑克是给粗人玩的
Poker's for assholes.

348
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,880
是你杀了温斯顿・郑吗?
Did you kill Winston Cheng?

349
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,960
没有 妈的 没有
No. Shit no.

350
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,120
当然不是我
Of course not.

351
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,000
不是
No.

352
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,800
林告诉你
Lim had told you there'd been

353
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,040
有人拍了你俩在一块的照片
photographs taken of the two of you together.

354
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,120
对我而言 这没什么 我们是中情局的
It meant nothing to me. We're the CIA.

355
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,920
我们有很多线人 他是其中之一 这没什么
We have informants. He was one of them. Big deal.

356
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,440
就算登在<海峡时报>也不关我事
Publish them in The Straits Times for all I care.

357
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,160
告诉所有人中情局正在秘密买地
Tell everyone the CIA is buying up land on the quiet

358
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,880
建立秘密工作基地?
to build a covert operational base?

359
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,520
不是好事 但我可以否认
Not great, but deniable.

360
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,240
- 不是为了詹姆斯・林 - 不是
- Not for James Lim. - No.

361
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,240
他吓得要死
He was freaking out.

362
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,040
他想从政
He wants to get into politics.

363
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,240
和美国佬串通可不是什么好事
Not a good idea to be in bed with the Yanks,

364
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,560
不过是他的问题 与我无关
but... his problem, not mine.

365
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,120
所以他雇了方去杀温斯顿?
So he hired Fong to kill Winston?

366
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,160
我原是这么想的
That's what I thought.

367
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,440
直到今天
Until today. 

368
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,200
谁杀了林?
Who had Lim killed?

369
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,800
还有别的事
And there's something else.

370
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,640
显而易见 某个人 某个耍纸牌的混蛋
Apparently, someone, some poker-playing asshole,

371
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,160
一直在深究
has been doing some digging,

372
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,280
发现了我都不知道的事
found out something even I didn't know about.

373
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,533
什么事?  
What's that?  

374
00:28:40,534 --> 00:28:42,720
詹姆斯・林有个沉默的同伙
James Lim has a silent partner.

375
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,360
- 有人在幕后资助他 - 是谁?
- Somebody's bankrolling him. - Who?

376
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,720
高层不愿透露
Head office won't say.

377
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,360
但他们肯定坏极了 因为 不管是谁
But they must be real bad, because, whoever it is,

378
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,662
我也被牵扯其中 
my involvement with them, 

379
00:28:52,663 --> 00:28:54,520
即使是通过林这么一个第三方
even through a third party like Lim,

380
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,720
也足以让我被遣送出局了
is enough to get me shipped out of here.

381
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,480
中情局和什么人都有往来
There's not too many people the CIA won't do business with.

382
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,400
俄罗斯人? 北越南人?
The Russians? North Vietnamese?

383
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,320
我倒想知道
I'd love to know.

384
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,007
无论谁 他们肯定有钱
Whoever it is, they've got the money 

385
00:29:07,008 --> 00:29:08,840
资助詹姆斯・林的地产贸易
to bankroll James Lim's land deals.

386
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,840
还能保释方出狱
And to bail Fong out of jail.

387
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,920
也会为保守秘密而杀掉任何人
And they'll kill anyone to keep their involvement secret.

388
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,800
只要找出这个人 就能找出谁杀了温斯顿
You find out who that is, you find out who murdered Winston.

389
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,960
可是 卡拉汉...
But, Callaghan...

390
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:27,120
...确保在他们发现你之前找到他们
...make sure you find them before they find you.

391
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:53,360
山姆 你不会相信这个
Sam, you won't believe this.

392
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,640
他进来的时候我正在看文件
I was looking at these documents when this man broke in.

393
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,800
- 刚开始我还以为是你 - 不 这就是方
- At first I thought it was you. - No, that's Fong alright.

394
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,160
毫无疑问他杀了温斯顿
And there's no doubt he killed Winston.

395
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:36,480
所以他们杀温斯顿是因为这条信息
So they killed Winston for this information.

396
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,360
我发现凯・索和詹姆斯・林
What I found out was that Kay Song and James Lim

397
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,160
共事好多年 收买地产
had been in partnership for years, buying up land.

398
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,880
凯・索?
Kay Song?

399
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,640
可是红龙绝对不会和中情局搅合到一起
But the Red Dragons would never be in bed with the CIA.

400
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:51,720
凯・索单独行动的 猛虎将军不知道
Kay Song is on his own. The Tiger General doesn't know.

401
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,440
如果这就是凯・索的秘密... 
If that's Kay Song's secret...

402
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,640
...凭这点就可以抓到他了
...that's how we get him.

403
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:01,160
如果猛虎将军知道他的孙子和中情局有瓜葛
If the Tiger General knew his grandson was in bed with the CIA,

404
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,640
他会杀了他的
he'd kill him.

405
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,120
- 你肯定? - 绝对肯定
- Are you sure of this? - Absolutely.

406
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:27,440
如果不这么做 凯・索会一直派人追踪我们
If we don't, Kay Song will keep sending people after us.

407
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,640
你 我 和苏玲
You, me, Su Ling.

408
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:35,080
我恳请跟杜凯见面
I respectfully seek an audience with Toh Kay.

409
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,120
我们不想惹麻烦
Look, we don't want any trouble. 

410
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,840
这有关于杀害我丈夫温斯顿・郑的凶手
This is about the murder of my husband, Winston Cheng.

411
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,675
女士 这不是你该来的地方 
Woman, this is not your place.  

412
00:32:41,676 --> 00:32:42,320
别动她!
Hey, leave her alone!

413
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,200
来人呐！
Somebody help!

414
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,800
快来人！
Somebody!

415
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,240
你孙子骗了你
Your grandson is cheating you.

416
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,240
他有秘密进账
He has secret accounts.

417
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,920
他有私房钱
He has secret money.

418
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,560
他在为自己工作
He's working for himself.

419
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,560
我要听听他们的话
I will hear them.

420
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,960
给自己做棺材 真是个好传统
It is a good tradition, making one's own coffin.

421
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,960
我们的习惯是在派上用场好多年之前就做好
It is our custom to do so many years before it is needed.

422
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,480
为死亡准备亦即为生命准备
To be prepared for death is to be prepared for life.

423
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,120
你们国家有这种传统吗?
Do you have this custom in your country?

424
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,600
应该有
You should.

425
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,920
一个到处出漏子的人
A man who blunders here and there

426
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,560
可能比想象得更早用上棺材
may need a coffin sooner than he thinks.

427
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,560
说吧
Speak.

428
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,560
不是你
Not you.

429
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,080
你和这个人在一起干什么?
What are you doing with this man?

430
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,400
我和许多人都见过面啊
I have meetings with a lot of people.

431
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:08,760
- 做生意的 家族领袖 - 私房钱呢?
- Businessmen, clan leaders. - Secret money?

432
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,520
买片便宜地卖给美国人
For buying cheap land to sell to the Americans.

433
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,520
-我们就要赚钱了 - 美国人?!
- We were going to make a fortune. - Americans?!

434
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,600
是中情局
The CIA.

435
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:24,000
我们控制着这座岛 一百多年了 
For over 100 years, we controlled this island.

436
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,120
别人自以为有权有势
Others think they have the power.

437
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,080
可他们来了又走
But they come, they go.

438
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,560
英国人在这儿一个世纪 不也走了
The British, here for a century, they go too.

439
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,760
这座岛终于是我们的了
Finally we have this island to ourselves.

440
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:37,440
你还帮美国人掌权
And you help the Americans take power.

441
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,000
我是为了你
I did it for you.

442
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,720
你是为了自己
You did it for yourself.

443
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,760
为了钱
For money.

444
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,120
结束了
It's over.

445
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,120
不要给我看

446
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,160
别让我看见尸体
Do not let me see the body.

447
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:02,160
傻孩子
You stupid boy.

448
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,160
你以为你能把我们全杀了?
You think you can kill us all?

449
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,920
这倒是坚定了我的决心
This thinking confirms my decision.

450
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:11,600
不 是坚定了我的
No. It confirms mine.

451
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,000
像你这么老的人...
An old man like you...

452
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:18,920
年老体衰
So frail, so weak.

453
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,280
你疯了 我还能活很多年
You're mad. I have many years in me.

454
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,040
可能会 可能不会
Maybe. Maybe not.

455
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,360
你们走吧
You may leave.

456
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,960
我爷爷心脏病突发
My grandfather had a heart attack.

457
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,680
我们有证人
We have witnesses.

458
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,200
把这噩耗告诉我们的人吧
Go tell our people the bad news.

459
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,040
很抱歉你们目睹了这个令人悲伤的时刻
I'm sorry you had to be here for this sad day.

460
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:40,560
郑夫人 山姆
Mrs Cheng, Sam.

461
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,160
现在让我一个人沉浸在悲痛中吧
You may now leave me to my grief.

462
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,960
请进
Come in.

463
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,560
你想见我 先生
You wanted to see me, sir.

464
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,640
我会很愿意永远不见你
I'd happily never set eyes on you again.

465
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,640
不过当权者自作聪明
But the powers that be, in their wisdom,

466
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,800
决定冻结所有的调动
have decided to put a freeze on all transfers.

467
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,160
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

468
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,240
好像我才该是那个评审的人吧
It seems my position's the one up for review.

469
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:37,080
我不知道你做了什么 对谁亏欠
I don't know what you did or who you owe.

470
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:41,720
但是记住... 和狗睡 就得忍着跳蚤
But remember this... you lay down with dogs, you get up with fleas.

471
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,920
你按照你的方式行事 先生
Well, you played the game your way, sir.

472
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,920
和詹姆斯・林 进行土地贸易
With James Lim, with the land deal.

473
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,920
我只不过做了该做的
I just did what I had to do.


474
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:57,360
我所做的 都是为了这个组织为了我的祖国
Everything I did, I did for this organisation and for my country.

475
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,920
如果他们解雇我... 当然 会很伤心
If they sack me... sure, it'll hurt.

476
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,000
不过我可以每天照镜子
But I can look in the mirror every day.

477
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,720
你觉得你照镜子会怎么样 哈里森?
What do you see when you look in the mirror, Harrison?

478
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:11,240
因为总有一天 也许不是今天 不是明天
'Cause one day, maybe not today, not tomorrow,

479
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,800
但是总有一天那玩意儿会把你活吞了
but one day that thing is going to eat you alive.

480
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,760
谢谢你 先生
Thank you, sir.

481
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,000
你说对了一件事
Oh. You're right about one thing.

482
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,760
不是今天
Not today.

483
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,200
米勒少校
Major Miller.

484
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,280
我刚收到电报
I just got the telegram.

485
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,960
我下个月去华盛顿
I'm off to Washington next month.

486
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,120
这是唯一的副本了?
This is the only copy?

487
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,920
我们有交易的
We had a deal.

488
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:31,060
你坚持你的原则 我坚持我的
You kept up your end. I kept up mine.

489
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,600
也许我会在华盛顿见你
Maybe I'll see you in Washington.

490
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,640
总有一天
One day.

491
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,360
很可能
Good chance.

492
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,480
希望她值得你这么做
I hope she's worth it.

493
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:39,480
来来来 大家来喝一杯 开心点 来

494
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,030
温斯顿是我们的好朋友

495
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,120
温斯顿是个好男人
Winston is a good man.

496
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:48,820
哎呀夫人 你不要太过悲伤 放轻松下 过来

497
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:49,820
你讲啦

498
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,820
哎呀你是他老婆

499
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,279
今天中秋 中秋是个

500
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,794
...合家团圆的日子 
...is for family, 

501
00:41:05,795 --> 00:41:08,080
你们就像我的家人一样
and you are like family to me.

502
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:12,400
事实上 你们是我唯一的家人了
As a matter of fact, you are the only family I have.

503
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,120
所以 谢谢你们
So, thank you.

504
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,120
我讲什么

505
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,520
喝酒喝酒

506
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,880
我曾努力设想过温斯顿会说什么
Well, I tried to imagine what Winston would say,

507
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,360
然后我意识到他不过是整晚
and I realise he'd just be drinking

508
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:27,200
喝酒跳舞讲笑话
and dancing and joking all night long,

509
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,120
所以今晚我希望你们也这么做
so this is what I want you to do tonight.

510
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:47,440
# 我这颗心脏已经被伤了一千次 #
Ooh, this old heart of mine been broke a thousand times

511
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,760
# 每次你离开我都以为你会留下来 #
Each time you break away I think you're gone to stay

512
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:54,720
# 孤独的夜晚让记忆流淌 #
Lonely nights that come Memories that flow

513
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:59,440
# 把你带回来一次次地伤害我 #
Bringing you back again Hurting me more and more

514
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:05,600
# 也许向你表达我内心的爱是个错误 #
Maybe it's my mistake to show this love I feel inside

515
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:09,920
# 因为日子一天天过去 #
'Cause each day that passes by

516
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:14,320
# 因为你我从来不知道该何去何从 #
You've got me never knowin' if I'm comin' or goin', but I

517
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,600
# 不过我爱你 #
I love you-ou-ou

518
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:21,720
# 这颗老去的心 亲爱的 是为你而伤 #
This old heart, darling, is weak for you

519
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,720
# 我爱你 #
I love you-ou-ou

520
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:27,440
# 是的 我爱你 是的 我爱你 #
Yes, I do. Yes, I do

521
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:31,280
# 我这残老的手臂怀念你的拥抱 #
These old arms of mine miss having you around

522
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:36,160
# 催下我内心的热泪 #
Makes these tears inside start falling down

523
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:40,049
# 你用一个残缺的吻 #
Always with half a kiss 

524
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:43,440
# 提醒我错失的一切 #
you remind me of what I miss

525
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:46,400
# 虽然我努力控制自己 #
Though I try to control myself

526
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,080
# 我却像傻瓜一样咧嘴而笑 #
Like a fool I start grinnin'

527
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,960
# 因为我的大脑已经开始眩晕 #
Cause my head starts spinnin' 'cause I

528
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,960
# 因为我爱你 #
I love you-ou-ou

529
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:58,120
# 这颗老去的心 亲爱的 是为你而伤 #
This old heart, darling, is weak for you.

530
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,280
# 我爱你 #
I love you-ou.

531
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:04,480
# 是的 我爱你 是的 我爱你 #
Yes, I do Yes, I do.

532
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:15,080
# 我努力隐藏我内心的伤 #
Ooh, I try hard to hide my hurt inside.

533
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:18,960
# 这颗老去的心不停哭泣... #
This old heart of mine always keeps me cryin'...
 

534
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,920

对不起我对你撒谎了 
I'm sorry that I lied to you.

535
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,600
也许我只是... 我太想跟你在一起了
I guess I just... I wanted to be with you so badly

536
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,000
所以我不知道该怎么做才能实现愿望
that I lost sight of what I was doing to get there,

537
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,314
要是你不想跟我说话... 我也理解 
and I understand if you don't want to talk to me...  

538
00:43:45,315 --> 00:43:45,840
没关系
that's OK.

539
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,480
我只想让你知道我不知道是谁杀了温斯顿・郑
I just needed you to know that I had no idea who killed Winston Cheng.

540
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,800
我知道
I know.

541
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:55,080
山姆全查出来了
Sam found out everything.

542
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:57,880
郑先生的死跟中情局无关
Mr Cheng's death had nothing to do with the CIA.

543
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,040
康拉德 我明白也接受
Conrad, I know and accept

544
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,280
你不能把工作上的事都告诉我
that you can't tell me everything about your job,

545
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,262
但我向你问问题的时候 
but if I ask you a question 

546
00:44:08,263 --> 00:44:09,920
是想要一个诚实的答案
I expect an honest answer.

547
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,669
或者说"无可奉告"就可以了  
Or just say, 'No comment.'  

548
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:14,200
无可奉告
No comment.

549
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:17,400
"无可奉告" 别说谎
'No comment.' Don't lie.

550
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:21,160
- 我得确定我能信任你 - 你可以信任我
- I need to know that I can trust you. - You can.

551
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,320
我们努力来实现吧
Then let's try to make this work.

552
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,240
送给你的
I got you this.

553
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,520
谢谢
Thank you.

554
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,040
小心点吧 你个臭小子
Take that, you little piece of shit.

555
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:28,680
# 我放下我的尊严 #
I swallowed my pride

556
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:32,440
# 我祈求你祈求你 #
And I beg I beg of you

557
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:38,600
# 宝贝 请不要再让我为你流泪 #
Oh, baby, stop these tears that you are putting me through.

558
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,920
# 请读一下我的信 #
Please read my letter.

559
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:47,200
# 你为什么不逐行逐句地读...? #
Why don't you read every line...?
 

560
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:50,280

有时候 我能感受到他的手在我的发间
Sometimes, I can literally feel his hand in my hair.

561
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,800
就像一个梦 直到我醒来
Like in a dream, except I'm awake.

562
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,920
你一晚上都在想她
You've been thinking about her all night.

563
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:09,680
# 这是我最后一封信了 宝贝 #
This is my last letter, baby

564
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,160
# 亲爱的 这就是告别... #
Oh, darling, this is goodbye...
 

565
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:13,640

去找她吧
Go to her.

566
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:18,200
# 你知道 我不需要照片 #
You see, I need no picture

567
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:22,960
# 来让我记住你 #
To remind me of you

568
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:30,120
# 还有我与你共度的这些美好时光 #
Oh, and all these wonderful moments that I have spent here with you

569
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:36,440
# 所以 我放下我的尊严 #
So, I swallowed up my pride

570
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,160
# 我祈求你 我祈求你 #
And I beg, I beg, I beg of you

571
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:44,160
# 宝贝 为什么你还不停下来...? #
Oh, baby, why don't you stop now...?
 

572
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:02,080

- 克莱尔 - 山姆
- Claire. - Sam.

573
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,520
我们能谈谈吗?
Can we talk?

574
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,680
我来收拾行李
I'll finish packing the luggage.

575
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,120
你该跟他谈谈
You should talk to him.

576
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:33,040
- 克莱尔 等等 - 你来干什么?
- Claire, wait. - What are you doing here?

577
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,480
- 留下来吧 - 留下来?
- Stay. - Stay?

578
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,920
我爱你 克莱尔
I'm in love with you, Claire.

579
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:44,240
我以前从没有爱过一个人
I've never loved anyone before.

580
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,520
你知道这对我来说意味着什么吗?
Do you have any idea what it's been like for me?

581
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:50,092
我不知道你已经告诉弗兰克了 
I didn't know you'd told Frank. 

582
00:47:50,093 --> 00:47:51,000
你为什么不告诉我?
Why didn't you tell me?

583
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,480
因为你已经说清楚了
Because you made it very clear

584
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,760
跟我在一起的生活太艰难太压抑太...
that life with me was too hard or cramped or...

585
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,132
我以为我在做正确的事  
I thought I was doing the right thing.  

586
00:47:56,133 --> 00:47:56,840
什么正确的事?
How?

587
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,627
大家都在背后嘲笑我的时候 
How were you doing the right thing 

588
00:47:58,628 --> 00:47:59,880
你把我留在塔克沃思家
by leaving me at the Tuckworths',

589
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:01,960
这就是正确的事?
everyone sniggering at me behind their back?

590
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,880
我... 对不起
I... I'm sorry.

591
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:09,320
对不起
I'm sorry.

592
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:15,920
我知道你很抱歉 看看你的脸
I know you are. Look at your face.

593
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,160
不要走
Don't go.

594
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,800
现在是什么情况?
So what happens now?

595
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,360
我们得把你的行李从车上卸下来
Well, we've got to get your luggage out of the car.

596
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,680
然后呢?
And then?

597
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:48,800
然后我们回到我家
And then we go back to my place.

598
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:56,040
我们吃点面条和辣椒螃蟹
We get noodles and some chilli crab.

599
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,920
我们来点月饼
We get mooncake.

600
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,040
今天是中秋节
It's the Festival of the Moon.

601
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:09,240
看月亮升到空中 再看着它落下
Watch the moon rise, then watch it set.

602
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,960
我再也不会让你离开了
I'll never let you go again.

603
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:18,960
这比我想象的还要美妙
It sounds more wonderful than I can imagine.

604
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:31,400
- 先生 到时间了 - 好的
- Uh, sir, it's time. - Yes.

605
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:48,400
那明天呢?
What about tomorrow?

606
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:49,880
我们会解决的
We'll work it out.

607
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,520
太晚了 山姆
It's too late, Sam.

608
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:12,760
我爱你
I love you.

609
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:19,000
我永远爱你
And I will always love you.
