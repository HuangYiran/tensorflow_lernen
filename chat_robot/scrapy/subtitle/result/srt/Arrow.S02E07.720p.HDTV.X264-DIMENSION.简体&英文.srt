我的名字叫奥利弗·奎恩
My name is Oliver Queen.

5
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,450
五年里  我被困在地狱一般的小岛上
After five years on a hellish island,

6
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,550
我回来只有一个目标
I have come home with only one goal--

7
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,830
拯救我的城市
to save my city.

8
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,830
但要达到目标  我不能像过去一样成为凶手
But to do so, I can't be the killer I once was.

9
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:19,450
为了纪念我的朋友
To honor my friend's memory,

10
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,400
我只能伪装成另一个人
I must be someone else.

11
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:21,870
{\an8}深切怀念托马斯·梅林
孝子

12
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,210
成为另一个存在

《绿箭》前情回顾
Previously on "Arrow"...

14
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:29,990
这个人对我们没用了
This one's no longer of use to us.

15
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:31,540
等一下  他或许还有用
Wait. He could still be useful.

16
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,100
她说得对  一旦我们杀了他的朋友
She's right. Once we get rid of his friends,

17
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,860
我们就得需要他带我们去墓地了
we'll need him to lead us to the grave.

18
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,610
你要再回到岛上
You're going back to the island.

19
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:39,660
你已经失去你的父亲了

20
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:40,910
你母亲还在
Your mom, she's still here.

21
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:42,390
她一定很想见见你
And I'm sure she'd love to see you.

22
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,340
我不会去监狱看她
I'm not going to that prison.

23
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,500
我只知道这样才能让她痛苦
It's the only way I know how to hurt her.

24
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,220
我很想恨你
And I want to hate you.

25
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,430
但是我恨不起来
But I can't.

26
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,140
我一直以为我们之间没有秘密
I didn't think that there were secrets kept between us.

27
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,690
妈妈  你在隐瞒什么

30
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:06,480
{\an8}半年前

31
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,430
上帝  请原谅我  我辜负了这座城市
And, god forgive me, I have failed this city.

32
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:13,710
我被迫参与了一项事业
I have been complicit in an undertaking

33
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,780
它有一个恐怖的目的

34
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,640
摧毁贫民区以及里面每一个人

35
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,580
如果你住在贫民区

36
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:28,360
{\an8}贫民区遭到攻击

37
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:26,970
请立刻离开

你和你的孩子们  命悬一线

拜托了

40
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,330
典狱长说我们得撤退了

41
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:38,810
帮我拿走这些
Help me get these out of here.

42
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,390
-那囚犯呢  -不管他们
- What about the inmates? - Leave 'em.

43
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,000
-来  放我出去  -不

你太野心勃勃
Too...ambitious.

47
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,310
你
You.

我喜欢你的工作

很有前途
Big future.

50
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,650
小心点
Hey, be careful.

51
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,010
可能会有余震
There's liable to be aftershocks.

52
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,800
我巴不得呢
Oh, I'm counting on it.

53

绿箭  第二季第七集

54
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:25,890
{\an8}现在

55
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,430
奎恩先生  您母亲胜诉的几率有多大
Mr. Queen, what are your mother's chances?

56
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,270
是不是有人监视以防她自杀
Is she on suicide watch?

57
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:35,810
奎恩先生  能发表评论吗
Mr. Queen, can you give us any comment?

58
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:38,000
这不公平  又不是他们进行庭审
It's not fair. They're not the ones on trial.

59
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,220
那也不能阻止简·洛林
That won't stop Jean Loring

60
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,670
用他们来获取公众的同情
from using them as props to drum up sympathy.

61
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:43,130
你看起来不大担心
You don't seem overly concerned.

62
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,920
她在直播电视里承认自己是共犯
She confessed to being an accomplice on live television.

63
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,420
她也说了是马尔科姆·梅林强迫的她
She also sad that Malcolm Merlyn coerced her.

64
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,320
你有什么证据  对吧
You have something, don't you?

65
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,180
我是你的合伙律师  亚当
I thought I was your co-counsel, Adam.

66
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:55,690
如果你手里有王牌
If you're holding a trump card,

67
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,590
难道不该和我分享一下吗
don't you think maybe you should share it with me?

68
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,220
这场庭审会很棒的
It's going to be a good trial.

69
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,220
我们进去吧
Come on, let's get inside.

70
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,650
你没必要这样做
You don't have to do this.

71
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:14,770
艾沃说有必要
Ivo says we do.

72
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,310
你的朋友们对他的人来说是个威胁
Your friends are a danger to his men.

73
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,880
快去  别惊动他们
Go. Quick and quiet.

74
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,130
斯莱德  莎朵  快跑
Slade! Shado! Run!

75
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,490
里面没人
There's no one here.

76
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,680
他们肯定转移了
They must have moved on from their position.

77
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,080
炸药放好了  这是引爆器
Chargers are placed. Here's the detonator.

78
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,610
确保他们无"家"可归
Make sure they have no place to return to.

79
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:45,710
去吧
Go.

80
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,050
你
And you.

81
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,330
现在你要带我们去墓地
Now you're going to take us to the graves.

82
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,340
走吧  拉他起来
Let's go. Get him up.

83
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,530
动身
Let's get clear.

84
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,550
你找到引爆器了吗
Did you find the detonator?

85
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:03,380
找到了
Yes.

86
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:07,990
我们真走运
We were lucky.

87
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:11,250
是我走运  你很厉害
I was lucky. You were good.

88
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,080
不管怎样
Either way...

89
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,090
奥利弗都在他们手上
they have Oliver.

90
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,050
我去找他
I'm going after him.

91
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:18,960
我陪你去
Not alone.

92
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,730
你都没法走路
You can barely walk.

93
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,100
所以我更不能待在这里
All the more reason not to stay here.

94
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,710
不能再给他们一次把我炸飞的机会
Give them another chance at blowing me up.

95
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:35,930
你俩没事吧
Are you two ok?

96
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,140
我该问你这个问题
I should be asking you that question.

97
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,180
我没事
I'll be fine.

98
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,720
你看上去像得了流感
You look like you have the flu.

99
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:40,790
如果真是那样  我不该
If that's true, I shouldn't

100
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,460
浪费时间接种疫苗的
have wasted my time getting vaccinated.

101
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,920
狄格尔  不管是怎么回事  回家去吧
Diggle, whatever it is, just go home.

102
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,300
奥利弗  我能处理好的  好吗
Oliver, listen, I can take care of things. All right?

103
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,200
不  我们没事的
No, we'll be fine, all right?

104
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,200
去休息吧  别逼我叫警察
Go rest. And don't make me call a cop.

105
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,900
这里就有几个
There are a few of them around here.

106
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,800
我被迫参与了一项事业
I have been complicit in an undertaking

107
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,010
它有一个恐怖的目的
with one horrible purpose--

108
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:28,370
摧毁贫民区以及里面每一个人
to destroy the glades and everyone in it.

109
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:32,360
奏效了  贫民区被毁
And it worked. The Glades were destroyed.

110
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,350
哀横遍野  人们流离失所
Homes and lives were lost.

111
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,530
都是因为她的行为
All because of her actions.

112
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,460
确实  她想清楚之后做了悔改
True, she had second thoughts;

113
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:42,100
自责促使她发表这份声明
remorse which compelled her to deliver this statement.

114
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,580
但我想替那天逝去的503条生命
But on behalf of the 503 lives

115
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,180
在这里说一句话
that were extinguished that day,

116
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:49,740
莫伊拉·奎恩  你的自责太迟了
I say, Moira Queen, your remorse comes too late.

117
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,110
在过去的五年里
For the last five years,

118
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,180
我和我家人的生命
under the threat for my life

119
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,090
受到了威胁
and the lives of my family...

120
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,260
为什么这些威胁没有让她沉默
Why wouldn't those threats silence her?

121
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,430
为什么莫伊拉·奎恩没有被吓倒
Why wouldn't Moira Queen be terrified?

122
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,230
马尔科姆·梅林杀了她的第一任丈夫
Malcolm Merlyn killed her first husband,

123
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,550
绑架了她的第二任丈夫
abducted her second.

124
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,610
她为什么不担心自己的性命
Why wouldn't she be in fear for her life?

125
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,690
不担心自己儿女的性命
For the lives of her children?

126
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,970
你们会怎么做
What would you do?

127
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,560
如果你们的子女
If it were your children in the crosshairs

128
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,250
被一个疯子控制
of a mad man's rage?

129
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,690
星级实验室的粒子加速器
They say the Star lab's particle accelerator

130
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,050
会如期开启
will be turned on right on schedule.

131
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,900
其他新闻  我们刚刚收到消息
In other news, we have just received word

132
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,730
莫伊拉·奎恩庭审中的正反两方
that both sides have now completed their opening statements

133
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,540
都已经完成了开庭陈词
in the Moira Queen trial.

134
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,770
别理解错了  但你看起来很恶心
Don't take this the wrong way, but you look disgusting.

135
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:36,670
好吧  我感觉不太好  费利西蒂
Yeah, well, I don't feel great, Felicity.

136
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,360
你有没有解决的办法
Is there a right way to take that?

137
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,010
你应该回家
You should go home.

138
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:42,650
我正要回去
I am going.

139
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:45,980
我只是得安排一个替补保镖
I just need to make arrangements for a replacement bodyguard.

140
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,430
你打流感疫苗了吗  我从没打过
Did you get the flu shot? Personally, I never do.

141
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,260
我知道我应该打
I know that I should.

142
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,870
可我  我对针头很恐惧
I just, I have this thing about needles.

143
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,240
对尖的东西都恐惧
All pointy things, really.

144
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,530
这很讽刺  想想我们跟谁共事
Which is ironic, considering who we work with.

145
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:57,750
对  不是流感  费利西蒂  更像是
Yeah, it's not the flu, Felicity, it's more like...

146
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,590
狄格
Dig!

147
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,590
有人吗
Hello?

148
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,430
你在这里吗
Are you here?

149
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,250
在这里  在那里
Here...there...

150
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,010
在任何地方
Everywhere.

151
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,130
那么
So.

152
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,950
我们的科学项目进展如何
How goes our little science project?

153
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,600
如你所料
Working like you said it would.

154
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,940
多美妙啊
How wonderful.

155
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,500
是这样
Ah, so listen.

156
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,670
干这事要五万块
Doing the thing was 50,000.

157
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,940
保守这个秘密
Keeping quiet about it,

158
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,010
我觉得应该再加五万
I'm thinking it should be 50 more.

159
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,100
不过我想让流言传开
Oh, I want word to spread.

160
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,780
这正是整体目标的一部分
It's kind of the whole objective, actually.

161
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,400
你懂我意思吗
You see my point?

162
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:43,430
你应该知道  我觉得事后谈判
You should know, I find post hoc negotiation...

163
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:44,900
很令人讨厌
distasteful.

164
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,290
真可惜你看不到你的工作
Such a shame you won't get to see

165
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,260
会得到怎样的成果  博士
what your works have wrought, doctor.

166
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,530
但很快  所有人都能看到
But soon, everyone else will.

167
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:59,870
而且他们会祈求它快点结束
And they'll beg for it to end.

168
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,200
你来这里干什么
What the hell are you doing here?

169
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,180
我听说你昏过去了
I heard you passed out.

170
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,420
我让费利西蒂别打电话给你
I told Felicity not to call you.

171
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,400
对  但在那之前  你喊了一声就倒下了
Yeah, but before that, you said "Gaw" And "Thud,"

172
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,730
所以我没把你的话当回事
so I didn't take it very seriously.

173
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,290
她打给我是对的  狄格尔  你需要就医
She was right to call me. Diggle, you need medical attention.

174
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,150
他不止需要就医  狄格昏过去时
He needs more than that. When Dig passed out,

175
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,500
我把他的血样给了公司里的一个化学家
I sent a sample of his blood to a chemist I know at QC.

176
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,890
他欠我人情  说来话长
The guy owes me a favor. Long story,

177
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:26,170
我帮他取消过停车罚单
I fixed his parking ticket.

178
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,050
其实也不是很长
Huh. I guess it's not that long.

179
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:30,160
费利西蒂  血样
Felicity. The blood sample.

180
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,680
对  迷魂检测的结果  显示阳性
Yeah. It came back positive-- for trace amounts of Vertigo.

181
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,060
我从没用过迷魂
I never used Vertigo before in my life.

182
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,710
你肯定是接触到了
You were exposed to it somehow.

183
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,100
迷魂又出现了吗
Vertigo's in play again?

184
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:40,390
伯爵迷魂吸入过量治好后
When the Count recovered from his OD on Vertigo,

185
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,810
他被送到了铁山监狱
he was sent to Iron Heights.

186
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:43,840
监狱在地震中被毁
That got hit in the quake.

187
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,790
他和娃娃制造者是同一种方式出来的
He got out the same way the Doll Maker did?

188
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,160
而且和娃娃制造者一样
And just like with the Doll Maker,

189
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,610
警方加班加点地工作来掩盖他的逃逸
prison officials worked overtime to keep the lid on the escape.

190
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,940
-我知道你在想什么  -不  你不知道
- I know what you're thinking. - No, you don't.

191
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:01,180
我当时选择不杀这个人
I made ahoice not to put an arrow in this guy.

192
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,910
而这么做是对的
And it was the right choice.

193
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,260
不会再有杀戮
There's no more killing.

194
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,710
我做了这个来祛除迷魂的药效
I worked this up to counteract the effects of Vertigo.

195
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,240
给狄格尔注射  我...
Give it to Diggle. I...

196
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,150
我得回法庭去
I need to get back to court.

197
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,890
我不在的时候  尽一切努力
While I'm gone, just work up whatever you can

198
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,010
查清楚狄格尔是如何
and figure out how Diggle got

199
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,600
在不知情的情况下摄入迷魂的
Vertigo in his system without his knowledge.

200
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,830
好  去吧
Ok. Go.

201
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,550
你第一次听说
When was the first time

202
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,240
那项事业是什么时候
you head about this so-called Undertaking?

203
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,240
跟别人一样  在我妈开记者招待会的时候
When everyone else did, when my mother gave the press conference.

204
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,880
你好像不是很能接受
Doesn't seem like you took it too well.

205
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,180
我很吃惊
I was surprised.

206
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,150
谁不会吃惊呢
Who wouldn't be?

207
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,760
你母亲当时  立刻就被收监了
Uh, your mother was, um, immediately take into custody,

208
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,370
不过你似乎去看守所里看过她
but I assume you went down to the precinct to see her?

209
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:48,690
其实在她搬走之前我都没见过她
Um, actually I didn't see her until she was moved.

210
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:49,610
搬到监狱之前
To the prison.

211
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,970
你还记得你是什么时候去看她的吗
Do you remember when you visited her?

212
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,950
不记得确切日期了
Uh, not the exact date.

213
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:58,230
没关系  我有访客记录
It's ok, I have the visitor log here.

214
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,200
十月九日
October ninth.

215
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,600
也就是五个月之后
Five months later.

216
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:04,560
怎么这么久
Why so long?

217
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,420
我  我
Um, I--I...

218
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,520
你没事吧
Are you OK?

219
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,740
请回答
An answer, please.

220
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:15,550
为什么等了五个月才去看你母亲
Why did it take you five months to visit your mother?

221
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,920
-法官大人  请让我  -不
- Your honor, if I-- - No.

222
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,970
我想听这个问题的答案
I want to hear this.

223
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,350
我需要时间
I needed time.

224
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,320
我那时
I was...

225
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,800
很生气  可能是太生气了
Angry. So angry, perhaps,

226
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,030
所以用了五个月你才原谅她
that it took you five months to forgive her?

227
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,910
事情很复杂
It was complicated.

228
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,590
不  很简单
No. It's very simple.

229
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:36,250
你因为你母亲的所作所为而责怪她
You blamed your mother for what she had done.

230
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,680
那么陪审团为什么不能
So why shouldn't the jury?

231
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,820
法官大人  我们没有问题
Your honor, we have no further questions

232
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,320
询问证人了
for the...witness.

233
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,430
亚当
Adam!

234
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,000
在哪呢
Where is it?

235
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:02,990
东西在哪呢
Come on, where is it?!

236
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,000
短袜在哪呢
The hosen, where is it?

237
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,250
什么
What?

238
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:10,500
箭头
The arrowhead.

239
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,410
所有报告都说这些尸体旁边都有箭头
Every report said it was with these bodies.

240
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,350
你说你和朋友曾经在这里
You said you and your friends were here.

241
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,530
现在东西呢
Now, where is it?

242
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,020
把他带出去
Take him outside.

243
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,260
让他告诉你他的朋友藏在哪里
Make him show you where his friends are hiding.

244
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:28,800
带我们去找他们
Take us to them.

245
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,520
我不知道他们在哪里
I don't know where they are!

246
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,810
告诉我  否则你的手就别想要了
Tell me, or you lose your hand.

247
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,720
我们试试别的选择
Let us suggest another option.

248
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:40,400
你把人交给我们  我们就不把你们全杀掉
You hand the kid over to us, and we don't kill you all.

249
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,130
你还好吗
Hey, are you OK?

250
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:56,540
不用担心我  我能承受住
Don't worry about me. I can take it.

251
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:17,830
和看上去一样糟糕吗
Was that as bad as it seemed?

252
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,630
西娅的证词吗  确实让我们受挫
Thea's testimony? It was a set-back.

253
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,170
我们本来指望她来
We were counting on her to--

254
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:24,310
教化我
Humanize me.

255
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,700
坦白的说  是的
Frankly, yes.

256
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,520
现在我们需要试试别的办法了
And now we're going to have to go another way.

257
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,900
不不  我跟你说过了  我不会出庭作证的
No. No, I told you, I won't testify.

258
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,600
我知道  但你必需出庭
I know you did. But now you have to.

259
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,770
她是对的  母亲
She's right, mom.

260
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,800
珍  能先回避一下吗
Jean, can you give us a minute?

261
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,000
好的
Yeah.

262
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,700
我知道你要说什么
I know what you're going to say.

263
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,970
但如果我作证  那会毁掉我们的家庭
But if I testify, it will destroy our family.

264
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,640
如果你的律师是对的  你没有其它选择
And if your lawyer's right, you don't have a choice.

265
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,930
妈  正是那些秘密让你陷入现在的困境的
Mom, secrets are what put you in this situation.

266
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,300
秘密和谎言
Secrets and lies.

267
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,160
现在是时候
And now it is time

268
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,490
让秘密大白于天下了
to give the truth its day.

269
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,400
我们不得不提
Now, I don't want us to lose sight

270
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,720
今天的庭审中的另外一个重要事件
of the other major event in court today.

271
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,730
亚当·唐纳犯病之前有什么迹象吗
Was there any indication of Adam Donner being ill?

272
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,320
没有  唐纳先生倒地前
No, there was very little warning before Mr. Donner

273
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,000
几乎没有任何迹象
collapsed to the ground.

274
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,000
我与法庭里
I've spoken to several

275
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,360
和我在一起的几个人谈过了
people that were in the courtroom with me...

276
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,380
感觉如何
How are you feeling?

277
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:24,780
还好
Fine.

278
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,350
你有张让人讨厌的扑克脸  狄格尔
You have a lousy poker face, Diggle.

279
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:27,780
他服用解毒剂了吗
Did he take the antidote?

280
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:30,490
没起作用  伯爵肯定改变了配方
Didn't work. The count must have futzed with his recipe.

281
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:31,480
我听说了庭审时
Heard what happened with Donner

282
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,100
唐纳发生的状况  还有西娅
at the court, and with Thea.

283
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:34,990
她怎么样了
How is she?

284
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:36,470
会好起来的
Going to be fine.

285
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,770
你的扑克脸不比我好看多少  奥利弗
Your poker face isn't much better than mine, Oliver.

286
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,470
-你好  星城  -费利西蒂
- Hello, Starling City. - Felicity!

287
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,400
想我了没
Miss me?

288
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:47,960
你们中的很多人注意到了
Many of you have noticed

289
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,100
你们的身体好像不是自己的
that you're not feeling quite like yourselves...

290
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,570
他控制了所有的本地通信基站
He's taken over all the local station feeds.

291
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:52,360
追踪他的信号
Track his signal.

292
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,070
就像我们这位优秀的助理地方检察官
Like our good assistant district attorney here.

293
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,060
你也许能因为他在正在进行的
You might recognize him from his work

294
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,230
莫伊拉·奎恩的庭审中的工作而认出他
in the ongoing Moira Queen trial.

295
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:02,540
-你好  亚当  -你想要什么
- Hi, Adam. - What do you want?

296
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,150
和你想要的一样
I want what you want.

297
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,980
让你能舒服些
For you to feel better.

298
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:07,770
死去吧你
Go to hell!

299
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:11,190
我觉得你希望这种痛苦结束
I do think you want the pain to end,

300
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:12,870
我可以帮你做到
and I can do that...

301
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,600
用迷魂
with Vertigo.

302
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,950
那是你身体所渴求的全部
It's what all of your bodies crave.

303
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,380
幸运的是  解脱的力量就在这里
Fortunately, the power of relief is right here.

304
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,480
你所需要做的就是去你友好的
And all you have to do is go to your friendly

305
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,140
迷魂供应商邻居那要一点
neighborhood vertigo dealer and request the cure.

306
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,280
供货上面  包你满意
Simply supply and demand at work.

307
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,620
跟我说你想要这个
Now, tell me you want this

308
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,690
那它就是你的了
and it's yours.

309
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,370
所有的痛苦就会立刻  消失
All the pain will just...disappear.

310
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:41,520
说出来
Say it.

311
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:43,890
说
Say...

312
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,080
你想要它
You want it.

313
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,090
我  我想  我想要它
I-I--want--I want it.

314
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:02,900
你看  多简单的解决办法
You see...A simple solution.

315
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,990
我是迷魂伯爵
I'm count Vertigo,

316
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,210
不是所有毒品都叫迷魂
and I approve this high.

317
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:12,580
我们现在做什么
What do we do now?

318
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:14,550
我们找到他
We find him...

319
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,360
然后干掉他
and we shut him down.

320
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,780
他是在哪里直播的
Where did he broadcast from?

321
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:30,270
他利用尖端科技研究实验室的卫星进行信号跳转
He bounced the signal off of S.T.A.R. Lab's satellite.

322
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,110
他能从马尔科维亚发送传输信号
He could have sent that transmission from Markovia.

323
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,330
他想呆在城里
He would want to stay local.

324
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:35,700
仔细看视频  有必要的话一帧一帧查
Scrub the footage, frame by frame if you have to.

325
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,500
一定会有些蛛丝马迹透露出
There's something on here that gives us a clue

326
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,220
他到底在哪
to where he is.

327
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,490
如果他是在全市散播病毒
If he dosed the whole city,

328
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:41,340
为什么只有一部分人表现出症状
why are only some people showing symptoms?

329
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,780
也许感染是有选择的
Maybe exposure was selective.

330
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,010
伯爵在只有像你和唐纳这样的人
Count contaminated something that only certain people,

331
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,780
能接触到的物品里做了手脚
like you and Donner, consumed.

332
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,190
一个戏剧性的变化
A most dramatic turn.

333
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,890
为了避免恐慌扩散
City officials are urging calm,

334
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:55,320
市政当局呼吁市民保持冷静
hoping to avoid widespread panic.

335
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,890
副市长莱维茨已经
Deputy Mayor Levitz has...

336
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,660
伯爵已经把星城变成了瘾君子乐园
The Count has turned Starling into a city of junkies.

337
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,820
关押唐纳检察官的地方有线索吗
Any leads on where he's holding A.D.A. Donner?

338
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:04,690
没有
Hmm, no.

339
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,330
虽然有点不近人情  但我更担心其他事
As cold as it sounds, I've got other concerns.

340
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:08,360
劳蕾尔
Laurel?

341
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,680
亚当的庭审笔记很细致
Adam's trial notes are very thorough.

342
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:13,040
最好是这样  你现在要做首席律师了
They better be. You're lead counsel now.

343
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,430
斯宾塞小姐  你才是地方检察官
Ms. Spencer, you're the District Attorney.

344
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,600
是的  不过陪审团了解你
Yes, but you're the one that the Jury knows.

345
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,460
你会做得很好的  劳蕾尔
You'll do fine, Laurel.

346
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,610
我明白
I know.

347
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,530
我想我找到了亚当的王牌
I just found Adam's trump card.

348
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,320
对不起  我不知道你起来了
Sorry, I didn't hear you woke up.

349
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,710
我只想一个人静静
I just want to be left alone.

350
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,680
真遗憾你不能一个人静静
Well, too bad that's not an option for you.

351
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,990
不过我有其他办法
But maybe I know something that is.

352
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,350
揍我
Hit me.

353
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:58,930
什么
What?

354
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,610
你奇怪为什么我以前总在晚上出去
You wonder why I used to go out at night,

355
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,190
和坏家伙们打架斗殴
looking to throw down with bad guys.

356
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:08,580
一部分原因是为了拯救这座城市
Part of it was to help the city.

357
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:10,820
另一部分
And the other part

358
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,380
是为了拯救自己
was to help me.

359
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,790
被一帮街头混混教训能拯救你
Getting tuned up by street thugs helped you?

360
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,650
是啊  我也不是省油的灯
Yeah, well, I gave as good as I got.

361
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:21,750
可以了
There we go.

362
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:24,970
挥拳的时候  我很愤怒
When I would throw a punch, I'd be so angry.

363
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:27,570
我会感到怒气在我体内升腾
I'd feel this heat rising inside of me,

364
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,210
喉咙里  胸口处
in my jaw, in my chest.

365
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,580
还有拳头
And my fists.

366
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,320
我需要个地方发泄
But I needed somewhere to go.

367
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,230
来
Come on.

368
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:46,400
西娅  你很生气
Thea, you're angry.

369
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,830
可能对你母亲  地方检察官  甚至你自己
At your mother, the D.A., yourself, maybe.

370
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,780
如果你不把怒气释放出来
But that anger is going to chew up your insides

371
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,080
它会绞碎你的内心
if you don't let it out.

372
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:55,850
我不会打你的  罗伊
I'm not going to hit you, Roy.

373
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,850
试试
Try.

374
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,110
试试
Try!

375
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,910
我说了揍我  你刚刚那一下
I said hit me, right? 'Cause that felt like--

376
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,880
我根本没有感觉
that didn't really feel like anything.

377
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:12,100
好多了  但要绷直手腕
Better. But keep your wrists straight.

378
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:12,990
不要只靠胳膊
Don't just use your arm.

379
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:14,420
把全身的力气集中到一起
Put your entire body into it.

380
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:18,050
来  再试试
Come on, again.

381
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,430
至少让我告诉莱拉
At least let me call Lyla.

382
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,370
她除了担心什么都不能做
All she could do is worry about me.

383
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:47,530
我有新发现
I found something.

384
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,210
看不出来有什么
I don't see anything.

385
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,370
你要注意看  唐纳看到了什么
Because you have to see what Donner does.

386
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,800
他的眼睛上有反光
His eye caught a reflection.

387
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,090
能放大点吗
Can you enhance?

388
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,690
你问这种问题是在鄙视我吗
It hurts me that you feel a need to ask.

389
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,290
那是什么  翅膀
What are those, wings?

390
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,530
这是市政印章
It's the city seal.

391
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:04,350
星城档案局
Starling Municipal Records Department.

392
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,390
那栋建筑自从办公电子化后
That building's been abandoned

393
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:06,830
已经被废弃
since the city went to digital.

394
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,680
时过境迁
Dollars to donuts,

395
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,590
现在变成了伯爵实施犯罪的地方
that's where the Count is operating out of.

396
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,950
他不会逍遥很久的
Not for long.

397
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:20,750
你不该来这里
You shouldn't be here.

398
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,920
-我的律师要  -莫伊拉
- My attorney needs... - Moira.

399
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,550
我知道跟你谈话可能会被取消执照
I know I could be disbarred for speaking with you,

400
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,410
但这跟工作无关
but this isn't something for lawyers.

401
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,520
是关于你的家庭
This is a family matter.

402
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:44,410
简告诉我  她安排你明天出庭
Jean told me she's calling you to the stand tomorrow.

403
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,670
是的
Yes.

404
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,740
你不能出庭作证
You can't testify.

405
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:57,510
如果你不想让我出庭  劳蕾尔
Well. The fact that you don't want me to, Laurel,

406
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,410
正说明我应该去
is a good indication that I should.

407
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:01,890
如果你出庭  我将不得不盘问你
If you take the stand, I'll have to cross examine you,

408
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,940
也不得不尽我所能
and I'll have to do it to the best of my ability.

409
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:06,070
-是的  我明白  -不  你不明白
- Yes, I understand. - No, I don't think you do.

410
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,980
先不管这对奥利弗和西娅有什么影响
Forget about what this will do to Oliver and Thea.

411
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:25,020
它会搞砸你的案子
It also could undermine your entire case.

412
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,400
所以  莫伊拉  拜托
So, Moira, please.

413
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:31,650
求你了
Please.

414
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:33,110
别逼我这么做
Don't make me use this.

415
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,810
你的一切都命悬一线
Everything is at stake for you.

416
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,620
我不想做那个夺走你一切的人
And I don't want to be the one to take it all away.

417
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,970
快点  拜托
Faster, please.

418
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:49,480
快  我们有一整座城的顾客
Faster! We have a city full of customers.

419
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,560
一点都不夸张
And I mean this literally.

420
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,630
恐怕我的生产设备对于如此高的需求量
I'm afraid my production apparatus is a little over-taxed

421
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:58,480
有点力不从心  虽然我能容忍
with the increased demand. I can live with it, though.

422
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:00,090
这座城市可不一定
I can't say the city can.

423
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,290
快走
Go.

424
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:06,320
别捣乱  我的小心肝
Be still, my heart.

425
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,890
离他们远点
Step away from them.

426
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:22,100
我听说你现在对杀人有点过敏
Yes, I've heard you've developed an allergy to killing.

427
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:24,210
-快点  -否则呢
- Do it! - Or what?

428
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:26,250
你会杀我吗
You'll kill me?

429
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:48,270
你真成了不杀戮一族
You're really on the no killing wagon?

430
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,460
真遗憾
Shame.

431
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,060
那你可就失去人生一大乐趣了
Really letting one of life's true pleasures pass you by.

432
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,860
你说过你不想出庭作证
But you said you didn't want to testify.

433
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:07,020
可是你不得不去
But you have to.

434
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:09,580
-因为我  -不
- Because of me. - No.

435
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,770
你不得不控制损失
You have to do damage control.

436
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:12,100
这不是你的错
None of this is your fault.

437
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,940
我们走到这一步是因为我的所作所为
We're here because of what I did.

438
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,200
现在你们都知道真相了
Now, you both know the truth,

439
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,700
但你们不知道全部真相
but you don't know all of it.

440
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,730
劳蕾尔知道
Laurel does.

441
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:23,070
她知道什么
What does she have?

442
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,310
你们不应该从法庭上才知道
You shouldn't have to find this out in court.

443
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:30,930
知道什么
Find out what?

444
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:38,370
若干年前  很多年前
Years ago-- it was many yes ago...

445
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:43,960
你们的父亲正在搞他的
Your father was engaging in his--

446
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,150
他的出轨行为
his extramarital activities.

447
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,040
我当时心志不坚
And I had a moment of weakness.

448
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,790
我也出轨了
I cheated on him.

449
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,620
跟马尔科姆·梅林
With Malcolm Merlyn.

450
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,790
不
No.

451
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,860
不  我
No, I--

452
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:12,280
我问过你这事儿
I asked you about this.

453
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,400
去年
Last year.

454
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,940
你说你们俩之间什么都没有
You said that there was nothing between you two!

455
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:20,710
是没有  甜心  我跟他不是什么婚外情
There wasn't. Sweetheart, it wasn't an affair.

456
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,100
非常短暂  而且已经是很久以前了
It was very brief, and a long time ago.

457
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:25,750
尽管如此  你还是跟梅林先生保持朋友关系
And despite it, you remained friends with Mr. Merlyn.

458
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:28,570
事实上  他经常参加你们家的派对
In fact, he frequently attended parties at your home.

459
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:31,890
马尔科姆杀害我丈夫之前是他最好的朋友
He was my husband's best friend until Malcolm killed him.

460
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:34,360
这就是为什么你声称
And this is why you claimed to feel

461
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,090
你觉得自己和你孩子
as though you were in fear for your life

462
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:37,290
遭到生命威胁
and the lives of your children?

463
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:39,390
我觉得这个理由足够让人信服了
Well, I think it's a fairly compelling reason.

464
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:42,880
去年
Last year,

465
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:45,040
你的第二任丈夫  沃尔特·斯蒂尔
your second husband, Walter Steel,

466
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:48,040
被梅林先生绑架了  对吗
was abducted by Mr. Merlyn, is that correct?

467
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,560
是的  如你所说
Yes. So you are saying.

468
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,820
为什么梅林不杀了沃尔特
Why didn't Merlyn kill Walter,

469
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,430
就像他杀掉你第一任丈夫一样呢
the same as your first husband?

470
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,810
我说服了马尔科姆不那么做
I convinced Malcolm not to.

471
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,680
马尔科姆听从了你的话
And Malcolm listened to you.

472
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:03,960
你的朋友饶了沃尔特的命
Your friend spared Walter's life,

473
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,100
你却想让陪审团相信
and yet, you'd have this jury believing

474
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,890
你和你的孩子当时有生命危险吗
that you and your children were in danger?

475
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:09,510
是的  我担心
We were. I was afraid--

476
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:10,980
担心被抓起来
Afraid of getting caught.

477
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:16,770
不管我年轻时候犯过什么错
Despite whatever youthful mistakes I might have made,

478
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:20,080
马尔科姆·梅林都是个危险分子
Malcolm Merlyn was a dangerous man.

479
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,420
那是对其他人而言
To other people.

480
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:24,340
但是真正对莫伊拉·奎恩和她的家人
But the only person who truly posed a danger

481
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,260
造成威胁的人
to Moira Queen and her family

482
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:28,420
就是莫伊拉·奎恩自己
was Moira Queen.

483
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,410
如果你想打我  那你就打吧
Ok, if you want to attack me, go right ahead.

484
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:55,950
但你想对我说的每一句话
But you should know that you're not going to say anything

485
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:57,510
我都对自己说过了
that I haven't already said to myself.

486
00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:00,920
我知道这对你来说很艰难
Whoa. I know that that was difficult for you,

487
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,700
我只想关心一下你是不是还好
and I just want to make sure that you're ok.

488
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,670
不  不
No, no.

489
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:09,050
我不明白在我刚刚的所作所为之后
I don't understand how you can forgive me

490
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:10,790
你怎么还能原谅我
after what I just did in there.

491
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,250
换了任何人都不会原谅我
I don't understand how anyone could.

492
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:22,540
显然  是你们三个
So, obviously you three

493
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,490
把灵符拿出了山洞
took the hosen out of this cave.

494
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,470
把他抬起来
Lift him up.

495
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:29,440
我现在知道不是他拿的
Now I know he doesn't have it,

496
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:31,290
所以就是你们俩其中一个
which means one of you two does.

497
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,180
把它给我  我们来谈谈交换条件
Give it to me, and we'll discuss an exchange.

498
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,950
我们不知道你在说什么
We don't know what you're talking about.

499
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:37,710
把奥利弗交给我们
Give us Oliver,

500
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,600
我们就让你们自己去找
and we'll leave you alone to look for it.

501
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:43,390
还有人想做蠢事吗
Anybody else want to be stupid?

502
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:48,260
好吧  把他带走
Fine. Take 'em.

503
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:49,630
给他松绑
Cut him loose.

504
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:55,670
你要干什么
What are you doing?!

505
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:07,550
我们不能停下来  他们跟上来了
We have to keep moving, they're following us!

506
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,400
我们知道
We know.

507
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,870
显然  我们还将继续关注
Obviously we're continuing to monitor

508
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:22,420
这些重大事件
both of these major stories

509
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:25,300
今天  星城因为它们而全市哗然
in what has become a significant news day here in Starling.

510
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:25,300
{\an8}莫伊拉·奎恩承认有婚外情

511
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:26,940
你能告诉我们关于
What can you tell us about--

512
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:29,140
奥利弗会被他母亲的事情重重包围
Oliver's going to be pretty wrapped up with his mother.

513
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,290
关于"伯爵"是怎么把"迷魂"
You making any process on how the Count's

514
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:32,950
弄到人体内的  你搞明白了吗
getting Vertigo into people's systems?

515
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,350
没什么进展
Not much.

516
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:37,290
每个点都是出现戒断症状的人的家
Each dot is the home of somebody with withdrawal symptoms.

517
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:38,680
看起来很随机
That seems pretty random.

518
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:40,360
因为的确很随机
That's because it's very random.

519
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,580
好吧
Ok.

520
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,920
有没有可能他们不是在家里中招的
What if people weren't exposed at home,

521
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,480
而是在工作时被下药的呢
what if they got dosed at work?

522
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:50,590
你能用他们的工作地点建立联系吗
Can you do this by their employment addresses?

523
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,730
我真的要好好想想
I'm really starting to wonder

524
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:54,360
怎么才能让你们刮目相看了
what it would take to impress you guys.

525
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,120
是一条路径  穿过城市
It's a trail. A path through the city.

526
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:01,100
你去过其中任何地点吗
Any place you've been?

527
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,080
戴尔街59号  我在那里打的流感疫苗
59th and Dell, that's where I got my flu shot.

528
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,760
你是在这些车上打的疫苗  对吗
You got your vaccination from one of those trucks, right?

529
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,230
其中一辆流动疫苗车
One of those roving flu trucks?

530
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:09,000
{\an8}星城移动医疗

531
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:08,760
这条路径
The route.

532
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,950
是流感疫苗车的行动路线
It's a flu vaccination tour.

533
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:12,910
星城移动医疗派出的疫苗车
A truck sent out by Starling City Mobile Care.

534
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:15,840
打了一针我就上瘾了  这可能吗
I got addicted after one injection? That can happen?

535
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,980
当然可能  不信试试海洛因
Sure. Try heroin some time.

536
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,480
不要试
Not try...try.

537
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,260
好吧  这车现在在哪里
All right, where's the truck now?

538
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,780
城区  你想怎么办
Downtown. What do you think?

539
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:25,170
通知奥利弗吗
Call Oliver?

540
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:27,060
不不  他现在家事缠身  我去
No, no, he's busy with his family. I'll go.

541
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,640
不行  不能让你去
Yeah, no. That's not happening.

542
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,300
我去
I'll go.

543
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:34,300
费利西蒂  太危险了
Felicity, it's too dangerous.

544
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,210
不会有事的  如果有事  我会叫你的
It could turn out to be nothing. If it's not, I'll call.

545
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:38,890
...您正在观看的法庭剧
...courtroom drama you've just witnessed?

546
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,820
贝瑟尼  没人料到取证结果会是这样
Bethany, no one expected the turn that testimony took.

547
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,290
莫伊拉·奎恩与马尔科姆·梅林
A revelation that Moira Queen

548
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:45,460
曾经的一段恋情曝光
once had an affair with Malcolm Merlyn

549
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:48,130
成为公诉人盘问的火力点
became the sole focus of the prosecution's cross.

550
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:02,560
有人吗
Hello?

551
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,540
有人在家吗
Anybody home?

552
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,760
"迷魂"  被我逮到啦
Vertigo. Got ya.

553
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,810
有意思
Funny, eh?

554
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,920
你把我的台词抢先说了
You took the words right out of my mouth.

555
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:35,550
西娅
Thea?

556
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,450
今晚就到此为止吧
Can we call it a night?

557
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:40,020
陪审团表示他们可能能出结果了
Jury just signaled that they could have a verdict.

558
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,620
法官不会让他们回家的
Judge will not send them home.

559
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:43,080
他希望能结束这案子
He wants to get this over with.

560
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,500
我也想快点结束这案子啊
Line forms behind me.

561
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,050
这么快就能出结果  恐怕不妙吧
A verdict that quickly is bad, isn't it?

562
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:50,320
我觉得你俩得做好最坏的打算
I think the two of you should prepare for the worst.

563
00:29:57,850 --> 00:29:59,020
我接个电话
Excuse me.

564
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:01,100
费利西蒂
Felicity...

565
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,100
奥利弗
Oliver.

566
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,450
你不介意我叫你奥利弗吧
Is it ok if I call you Oliver?

567
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,190
听到我的声音觉得很意外吧
Surprised to hear from me, right?

568
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,860
但我比你还意外
Not as surprised as I was.

569
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,220
你看  我发现这位
You see, I find this

570
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:18,440
长得不太美的金发小妞直闯我的地盘
not unattractive blonde getting all up in my business.

571
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,770
她身上有什么呢
And what does she have on her?

572
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,920
奎恩联合企业的工作牌
A Queen Consolidated I.D. badge.

573
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,710
我问自己  为什么这个名字这么耳熟呢
Now, I think to myself, why does that name ring a bell?

574
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:30,880
奥利弗·奎恩
Oliver Queen.

575
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:33,160
去年他想收买我
He tried to buy off me last year,

576
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,430
随后我就被兜帽男送进了软垫病室
just before the hood put me in a padded cell.

577
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:40,250
也就是  绿箭侠
Ipso facto, Arrow.

578
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,160
你去哪儿
Where are you going?!

579
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,750
我办公室出了点事
Something's come up at the office.

580
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,980
奥利  陪审团还没出结果呢
Ollie, the jury!

581
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,030
我必须得走了
I have to go.

582
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,430
时髦花哨的办公室啊
Pretty swanky offices.

583
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:29,720
在这儿你可以看到你母亲造成的所有破坏
You can see all the destruction that your mom caused from up here.

584
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,620
你想干什么
What do you want?

585
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:34,930
世界和平和个人满足
World peace and personal satisfaction.

586
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:38,460
不过顺序倒可以反过来
Though not necessarily in that order.

587
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:43,690
你给我下药  把我关进监狱
You poisoned me and put me in a hole.

588
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,160
你不知道为此我有多恨你
You have no idea how much I hated you for that.

589
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:50,190
结果恨你的还不止我一个
Turns out, someone else hates you, too.

590
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,000
-还有谁  -谁
- Who? - Who?

591
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:54,450
你发现之后会大吃一惊的
Oh, you're going to be surprised when you find out.

592
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:56,710
他是个有钱人
He's a man of means.

593
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,310
支持我的新事业好让我把你引出来
Set me up with my new operation so I could draw you out.

594
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:02,240
-你想干什么  -杀了你
- To do what? - This.

595
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:08,730
那你得再努力点
You're going to have to try harder.

596
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:09,900
去死吧
Done!

597
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:20,630
过来
Come on! Ahh!

598
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:28,080
现在我们采用方案二
So now we move on to plan b.

599
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,190
奥利弗  别  别为了我做傻事
Oliver, don't! Not for me!

600
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,880
安静点好吗  我在威胁他呢
Quiet, please. I'm threatening.

601
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:36,270
放下你的弓
Lower your bow.

602
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,510
你要找的人是我
Your problem is with me.

603
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,480
与她无关
It's not with her.

604
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,310
那就把这当做是
Well, then, consider this your penalty

605
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,980
逼我采用方案二的处罚吧
for making me go to plan b in the first place.

606
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:15,550
没事了
It's all right.

607
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,100
你安全了
You're safe.

608
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:19,480
你中弹了
Oh, you were shot.

609
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,540
没什么大不了
Hey. It's nothing.

610
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,120
有什么消息吗
Any news?

611
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,290
你去哪儿了
Where have you been?

612
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:03,400
奎恩企业那儿出了点事
Something... Happened at Queen Consolidated.

613
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,920
一会儿看新闻你就知道了
You will see it on the news later.

614
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,770
现在先别担心
Just don't worry about it.

615
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,920
如果有结果了你要怎么办
What would you have done if there'd been a verdict?

616
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:13,500
西娅  我不知道
Thea... I don't know.

617
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,040
你还好吗
Are you OK?

618
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:20,540
陪审团回来了
Hey. Jury's back.

619
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:22,180
走吧
Come on.

620
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:27,210
我收到了陪审团出结果的纸条了
I have received a note that the jury has arrived at a verdict.

621
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,850
请公布裁决
Please publish the verdict.

622
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:36,950
星郡最高法院
In the superior court of Star County

623
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:40,080
对州检察院向莫伊拉·奎恩提起的
State versus Moira Queen verdict...

624
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:43,000
一级阴谋指控的裁决是
on one count of conspiracy in the first degree,

625
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:46,900
被告无罪

对另外503案件谋杀指控的裁决是
On the 503 counts of murder in the first degree,

627
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,630
被告...
the defendant is found...

628
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,990
无罪
not guilty.

629
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,630
妈妈
Mom.

630
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:20,940
我太爱你们了
I love you both so much.

631
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,860
令人震惊的结果  莫伊拉·奎恩无罪释放
A stunning result, as Moira Queen is acquitted of all charges.

632
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:36,780
{\an8}莫伊拉·奎恩无罪释放

633
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,430
就在今天
In a day that's provided

634
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:40,700
一周以来的冲击和法律纠纷
a week's worth of shocks and legal twists,

635
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,060
在大多数人看来已经落幕
many had pronounced this case a done deal.

636
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:44,400
恭喜
Congratulations.

637
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:46,230
这么说合适吗
Is that appropriate?

638
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,750
她不该赢这场官司的
She should have lost.

639
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,140
她应该被判有罪
She should have been convicted.

640
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:52,900
你希望她那样
Did you want her to be?

641
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,170
我认为她有罪
I expected her to be.

642
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:57,890
这裁决根本不合理
Verdict doesn't make sense.

643
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:00,120
但你妈妈肯定很高兴吧  难以言喻的高兴
Still, your mom must be thrilled. Beyond.

644
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:02,550
更确切地说是惊吓
It's more like shock, I think.

645
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:06,560
他们正在收尾  我想来看看你
They're processing her now. I just wanted to check in on you.

646
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,460
还有你
And you.

647

652
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,680
我得回家见我的家人
I need to meet my family at home.

653
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:28,340
你们也回去好好休息吧
So you guys go home, get rest.

654
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,760
晚安
Good night.

655
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,030
晚安
Good night.

656

奥利弗  我
Oliver. I, uh...

657
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,370
-我想向你道谢  -没事
- I just wanted to say thank you. - Yeah.

658
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,900
我很抱歉
And I'm sorry.

659
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,300
为什么
For what?

660
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:53,730
我又惹上了麻烦  你只能杀了他
I got myself into trouble again, and you... killed him.

661
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,480
你又开始了杀戮  我很抱歉
You killed again, and I am sorry that I was the one

662
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,890
因为我  你做出了这样的艰难抉择
to put you in a position where you had to make that kind of choice.

663
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:01,060
费利西蒂
Felicity...

664
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:05,750
他抓住了你  还企图伤害你
He had you, and he was going to hurt you.

665
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,060
那个抉择很容易
There was no choice to make.

666
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,190
你为什么那么做
Why did you do that?!

667
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,090
因为你曾经救过我一命
Because you stopped the captain from killing me.

668
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,100
谢谢你能来
Thank you for coming.

669
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:27,530
莎朵 他看起来不太好
Shado, he doesn't look too good.

670
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:30,340
他确实不好  这是谁
He's not. Who's this?

671
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,610
说来话长  他们要找的
It's complicated. That hosen thing

672
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:34,500
那个护身符还在飞机上
they're looking for is back on the plane.

673
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,120
不  在我这里
No, I've got it.

674
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,600
一面刻着佛教的文字
It has a buddhist inscription on one side.

675
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:41,950
让我想起我的父亲
It reminded me of my father.

676
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,770
我敢肯定他们不是冲着佛教来的
I'm pretty sure they aren't interested in buddhism.

677
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:45,980
另一面有什么
What's on the other side?

678

是坐标
Coordinates.

681
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,760
什么坐标
To what?

682
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:59,570
一艘二战期间搁浅在这里
A kairyu-class japanese submarine

683
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,660
海龙级的日本潜水艇
which ran aground here during world war II.

684
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,570
这些人为什么要找一艘70年前的潜水艇
What do these guys want with a 70 year old sub?

685
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:06,900
潜艇本身并不重要  但上面的东西
The sub isn't important, but what's on it...

686
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:09,820
能够拯救人类
It'll save the human race.

687
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:13,180
能救他吗
Will it save him?

688
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:26,050
恭喜你  没有因为自己的愚蠢而死
Well, you survived your own stupidity, congratulations.

689
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:32,680
你知道吗  我还指望你能够应对
You know... I needed you to deal with any resistance

690
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,650
在岛上遇到的抵抗  我得说
that I encountered on the island. I got to say,

691
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,840
你做得并不好
you've done a fairly lousy job of that.

692
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:42,150
恭喜你
Congratulations.

693
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,590
你升任为新船长了
You're the new captain.

694
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,590
{\an8}绿箭侠再开杀戒

{\an8}绿箭侠再开杀戒

697
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:54,490
结果却是让他
And all I accomplish is reigniting

698
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:56,030
重新开始了杀戮
the vigilante's killing spree.

699
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,310
先生  有进展了
Sir, there's been a development.

700
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:23,070
塞勒斯兄弟
Brother Cyrus...

701
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:25,730
你感觉如何
how do you feel?

702
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:31,370
更强大了
Stronger.

703
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,600
很好
Good.

704
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,650
你已经准备好了
Then you're ready.

705
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:42,330
奎恩女士  摆脱谋杀罪名的感觉如何
Mrs. Queen, how does it feel to get away with murder?

706
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,670
你出去以后  有辆车等着你
Once you go out back, there's a car waiting for you.

707
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:47,110
是你杀了自己的第一任丈夫吗
Did you kill your first husband?

708
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:48,280
别理他们  继续走
Just keep going.

709
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,900
很明显奎恩女士对于陪审团
Obviously Mrs. Queen is overjoyed that the jury

710
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:56,430
{\an8}法庭速递  入口

711
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:55,190
判定她是迫于威胁感到非常满意
has ruled that she was acting under terrible duress.

712
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:58,100
这边请  奎恩女士
This way, Mrs. Queen.

713
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,530
走高速公路比较快
The freeway will be quicker.

714
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:22,130
抱歉  奎恩女士
I'm sorry, Mrs. Queen.

715
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:23,950
有人命令我不要带你回家
I was instructed not to take you home.

716
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,250
至少暂时不要
Not yet.

717
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:38,580
这是哪里
Where are we?

718
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,090
我不认识这里
I-I don't know this place.

719
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,440
我把她带来了  先生
I've got her, sir.

720
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,220
你要干什么
What do you want?

721
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:50,270
你好  莫伊拉
Hello, Moira.

722
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,840
你不是  你不是已经死了吗
You were supposed...they said you were dead!

723
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,990
在世上的某些地方  死亡不过是幻觉
There are parts of the world where death is an illusion.

724
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:58,140
我去过一处
I've been to one.

725
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:00,030
我学会了完美地伪装
I learned to be very convincing.

726
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:04,560
但我回来是因为你需要我的帮助
But I returned because you needed my help.

727
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,600
什么帮助
Help?

728
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,150
你的庭审
With your trial.

729
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:12,700
难道你觉得陪审团无缘无故
You didn't think that jury acquitted you

730
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,250
就会宣布你无罪吗
without a little persuasion?

731
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:16,070
天哪
Dear god.

732
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,420
你想怎么样  马尔科姆
What do you want, Malcolm?

733
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:24,820
我在星城还有势力
I still have resources in Starling.

734
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:27,080
人脉
Associates.

735
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:31,600
在地方检察官办公室也有
Including one in the D.A.'s office.

736
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:35,500
我跟进了唐纳先生对你的调查
I followed Mr. Donner's investigation of you with interest.

737
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:38,260
这么多年你如此轻松地隐瞒我们的事
The ease with which you lied about us for years,

738
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:40,440
让我思索你是不是骗了我
it made me wonder whether you lied to me.

739
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,880
我没有
No. No.

740
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:46,580
我暗地里做了一个小小的亲子测试
It was a matter of a simple surreptitious genetics test

741
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:48,220
证实了我的怀疑
to confirm my suspicion.

742
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,320
别
Don't.

743
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:54,700
猜猜我在发现西娅是我女儿时有多高兴
Imagine my joy at learning that Thea is my daughter.
