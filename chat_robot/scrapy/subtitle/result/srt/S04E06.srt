1
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:23,018
有人吗?
Hey,is anyone there?

2
00:00:24,018 --> 00:00:26,729
我需要帮忙
Look,I need some help in here!

3
00:00:38,032 --> 00:00:40,410
好吧 听好
All right,look.

4
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,579
我知道你现在很恐慌
但是你没时间了
I know you're probably panicking right now,but there is no time for that.

5
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:44,330
你需要集中注意力
You need to focus.

6
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:47,834
我肯定你在想
是谁把你绑到了桌子上
I'm sure you're wondering  who tied you to the desk.

7
00:00:47,834 --> 00:00:50,920
事实上 是你自己
Well,the truth is,it was you.

8
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,465
我是说 是我
I mean,me.

9
00:00:53,465 --> 00:00:56,801
我这样做是因为
你需要你看到这个消息
I did it because I needed you to get this message.

10
00:00:56,801 --> 00:00:58,636
没时间给你详细解释
It would take too long to give you the full explanation,

11
00:00:58,636 --> 00:00:59,429
而且反正你也记不得
and you wouldn't remember it anyway,

12
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:01,681
那你就只能相信我了
so you're just going to have to trust me on this.

13
00:01:01,681 --> 00:01:07,437
现在 你可以在椅子下面
找到一把刀
Now,you'll find a knife taped to the underside of your chair.

14
00:01:07,437 --> 00:01:10,356
用它把你自己解开
Find it,and cut yourself loose.

15
00:01:13,026 --> 00:01:13,860
现在...
Now...

16
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,570
我需要你仔细听
I need you to listen.

17
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:20,366
你必须要找到这个女的
It is vitally important that you find this woman.

18
00:01:26,081 --> 00:01:28,124
我不知道她在哪
但是你得找到她
I don't know where she is, but you have to find her.

19
00:01:28,124 --> 00:01:29,334
她可以帮助你
She can help.

20
00:01:29,334 --> 00:01:31,169
检查一下餐厅 也许他们把她
带到了禁闭室 我不清楚
Check the mess hall,or maybe they took her to the brig,I don't know.

21
00:01:31,169 --> 00:01:32,962
但你一定要一直找下去
You just have to keep looking.

22
00:01:32,962 --> 00:01:36,925
不要管其他事 还有看在上帝的份上
不要相信任何人
Don't worry about anything else,and for god's sake,don't trust anyone.

23
00:01:36,925 --> 00:01:41,763
你要赶快找到她
如果你不成功 几百人会死去
Just find her and do it fast, because if you don't,hundreds of people are going to die.

24
00:01:41,763 --> 00:01:44,182
包括你
Including you.

25
00:02:43,283 --> 00:02:50,457
<font color=#38B0DE>Stargate Atlantis

00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,668
14小时前
14 hours earlier

27
00:03:00,675 --> 00:03:02,677
Katie?
Katie?

28
00:03:03,428 --> 00:03:04,721
Rodney!
Rodney!

29
00:03:04,721 --> 00:03:06,264
你到这来做什么?
Hey,what are you doing here?

30
00:03:06,264 --> 00:03:08,308
我们很长时间没见面了
听说你回来了 所以
Well,I heard you were back,and I hadn't seen you for a while,so--

31
00:03:08,349 --> 00:03:11,603
我知道 我们有一整个大陆要探索
yeah,I know.We have this whole new mainland to explore,

32
00:03:11,603 --> 00:03:13,563
我们一整个星期都在收集样本
and I've been bringing back samples all week.

33
00:03:13,563 --> 00:03:16,191
我懂了有什么有意思的东西吗?
So I see.Anything interesting?

34
00:03:16,191 --> 00:03:18,777
和我们在Lantia上发现的差不多
Well,it's all pretty similar to what we found back on lantia.

35
00:03:18,777 --> 00:03:20,612
不过我们找到了几个新物种
We found a few new species.

36
00:03:20,612 --> 00:03:24,741
哦 这到提醒我了
我给你准备了一个惊喜
Oh,which reminds me,I've got a surprise for you.

37
00:03:30,455 --> 00:03:33,917
我发现这个家伙
藏在一个灌木丛后面
I found this guy hiding in some shrubbery.

38
00:03:33,917 --> 00:03:35,085
这是什么?
What is that?

39
00:03:35,085 --> 00:03:39,589
它还没有名字 但是我想叫它...
Well,it doesn't have a name yet,but I'm thinking of calling it...

40
00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:42,008
Rodneyana villosa
rodneyana villosa.

41
00:03:42,008 --> 00:03:44,094
以你的名字命名的
After you.

42
00:03:44,094 --> 00:03:45,678
真的?
Really?

43
00:03:45,678 --> 00:03:46,763
你...你可以?
What...you can do that?

44
00:03:46,763 --> 00:03:48,306
嗯
Yeah.

45
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,600
小心
Be careful.

46
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,353
上面的刺能穿透皮肤
The bristles will pierce skin.

47
00:03:54,187 --> 00:03:55,980
不管怎样 我想我能不能
Anyway,look,I wondered if I could...

48
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,109
把你从这里带走去吃个午餐?
you know,tear you away from all this long enough to have some lunch?

49
00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:03,363
哦 我很乐意 但是...
Oh,I would-I would love to,but...

50
00:04:03,363 --> 00:04:05,615
我我想我生病了
I think I'm coming down with something.

51
00:04:05,615 --> 00:04:07,909
我头很痛 有时会头晕
I have a headache,and I've had a few dizzy spells,

52
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:11,246
所以我想去一下医务室
so I was thinking of going down to the infirmary.

53
00:04:11,246 --> 00:04:13,123
哦...
Oh,uh...

54
00:04:13,123 --> 00:04:14,916
那 我陪你去吧
well,I'll come with you.

55
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:16,918
哦 不用了 Rodney 你不必陪我
Oh,no,rodney,you don't have to do that.

56
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:19,129
我知道你很讨厌接近病人
I know how much you hate being around sick people.

57
00:04:19,129 --> 00:04:22,465
不 没关系的
no,really,it's fine.

58
00:04:22,465 --> 00:04:25,135
哦 那太好了
Oh,that is so sweet.

59
00:04:25,135 --> 00:04:26,010
谢谢
Thanks.

60
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,804
你先走
After you.

61
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:36,521
Brown博士...
Dr.Brown...

62
00:04:36,521 --> 00:04:38,356
你把我最重要的病人带来了
I see you've brought my number one patient.

63
00:04:38,356 --> 00:04:39,190
什么 不是
What?Oh,no,

64
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,526
我们不是为我来的
我是..为她来的
we're not here for me this time.I'm-I'm here for her.

65
00:04:41,526 --> 00:04:43,445
那好 我能怎么帮助你?
Oh,okay,well,what can I do for you?

66
00:04:43,445 --> 00:04:49,200
我的头很痛而且总是不好
还有我有点头晕
Well,I've got this really bad headache that won't go away,and I feel kind of dizzy.

67
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,618
你什么时候发现的?
When did you first notice it?

68
00:04:50,618 --> 00:04:52,579
今天早上 怎么了?
Some time this morning.Why?

69
00:04:52,579 --> 00:04:56,082
你是第四个因为这种症状
来找这的人了
Well,because you're the fourth person to come in here with those exact symptoms,

70
00:04:56,082 --> 00:04:59,252
植物学部的第二个
and the second person from the botany department.

71
00:04:59,878 --> 00:05:01,212
Gerald?
Gerald?

72
00:05:01,212 --> 00:05:02,338
嗨...
Hey...

73
00:05:02,338 --> 00:05:03,465
那是谁?
who's that?

74
00:05:03,465 --> 00:05:05,341
Gerald Baxter 她是我的队员
Gerald Baxter.He's on my team.

75
00:05:05,341 --> 00:05:07,302
你见过他的
You've met him before.

76
00:05:07,302 --> 00:05:10,013
他是收集虫子的那个 记得?
He's got the bug collection?

77
00:05:10,013 --> 00:05:11,848
哦 当然 对
Oh,sure,right,yeah.

78
00:05:11,848 --> 00:05:13,767
我现在记得了
I remember now.

79
00:05:13,767 --> 00:05:15,643
我需要采一些血样
Well,I'm going to need to take some blood.

80
00:05:15,643 --> 00:05:16,686
还有你的 博士
You,too,doctor.

81
00:05:16,686 --> 00:05:17,604
什么?
What?

82
00:05:17,604 --> 00:05:21,524
如果有病在传播的话
你可能也暴露了
If there is something going around,you might have been exposed to it as well.

83
00:05:21,524 --> 00:05:23,651
对不起
Sorry.

84
00:05:24,027 --> 00:05:28,364
Dorsey少校和他的小队
刚从M6R-214回来
Major Dorsey and his team just returned from m6r-214.

85
00:05:28,364 --> 00:05:31,493
他们检查了星球上的岩石碎片带
而且发现了一两艘
They examined the debris field above the planet and found the parts from one,

86
00:05:31,493 --> 00:05:33,578
复制者飞船的碎片
possibly two,replicator ships.

87
00:05:33,578 --> 00:05:36,664
Wraith组织起来进行还击
只是时间问题了
It was just a matter of time before the wraith got organized and started hitting back.

88
00:05:36,664 --> 00:05:37,707
我想也是
I suppose.

89
00:05:37,707 --> 00:05:40,043
他们毕竟打败了古人
They did defeat the ancients,after all.

90
00:05:40,043 --> 00:05:42,921
复制者看上去像古人
他们使用一样的科技
The replicators may look like the ancients,and they may use the same technology,

91
00:05:42,921 --> 00:05:45,048
要打倒他们要困难的多
but they're going to be a lot tougher to put down.

92
00:05:45,048 --> 00:05:47,258
Carter上校 请回话
Colonel Carter,come in,please.

93
00:05:47,884 --> 00:05:49,177
请讲 医生
Go ahead,doctor.

94
00:05:49,177 --> 00:05:50,887
我这有一个情况
I've got a situation developing.

95
00:05:50,887 --> 00:05:54,808
通知您我已经在医务室
这一层进行了隔离
Be advised I've imposed a quarantine on the entire infirmary level.

96
00:05:54,808 --> 00:05:55,767
怎么回事?
What's going on?

97
00:05:55,767 --> 00:06:00,772
过去的一小时内出现了
11名头痛和头晕的病人
11 patients have shown up here in the last hour,complaining of headache and dizziness.

98
00:06:00,772 --> 00:06:03,691
其中8人是刚从大陆回来的队员
Eight of them are from the survey teams that just got back from the mainland.

99
00:06:03,691 --> 00:06:05,235
知道是什么病吗?
Any idea what's wrong with them?

100
00:06:05,235 --> 00:06:08,822
我进行了血液检测并找到了
一种我从没见过的细菌
I ran some blood tests and found a bacteria I've never seen before.

101
00:06:08,822 --> 00:06:10,865
我正在检索古人的数据库
I'm checking it against the ancient database.

102
00:06:10,865 --> 00:06:12,242
你要我们怎么做?
What do you want us to do?

103
00:06:12,242 --> 00:06:15,453
首先我们要隔离
所有去过大陆的人
Well,the first thing we need to do is isolate everyone that went to the mainland,

104
00:06:15,453 --> 00:06:18,873
然后把他们送到辅助医学实验室
的Neves博士处做测试
and have them report to Dr.Neves in the auxiliary med lab for testing.

105
00:06:18,873 --> 00:06:20,250
知道了 有消息及时通知我么
Will do.Keep us posted.

106
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,584
更多的检测结果
More test results.

107
00:06:21,584 --> 00:06:22,836
你我都感染了
You and I are both infected.

108
00:06:22,836 --> 00:06:24,295
McKay博士也是
So's Dr.Mckay.

109
00:06:24,295 --> 00:06:28,466
好消息是最先发病的病例
只显示出温和的感冒似的症状
The good news is the most advanced case is still only showing mild,flu-like symptoms.

110
00:06:28,466 --> 00:06:30,135
也许病情不会再恶化了
Maybe it won't get any worse than that.

111
00:06:30,135 --> 00:06:32,095
希望如此
Yeah,let's hope so.

112
00:06:36,516 --> 00:06:38,852
现时
Present

113
00:06:38,852 --> 00:06:40,645
有人吗?
Hello?

114
00:06:55,535 --> 00:06:58,538
嘿 起来
Hey...hey,wake up.

115
00:06:59,122 --> 00:07:01,374
你在这里做什么?
What are you doing here?

116
00:07:01,374 --> 00:07:02,041
我...我不知道
I-I don't know.

117
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:03,752
你在做什么?
What are you doing?

118
00:07:04,252 --> 00:07:05,712
你不是军人
You're not a soldier.

119
00:07:05,712 --> 00:07:07,922
你说什么就是什么了
If you say so.

120
00:07:09,549 --> 00:07:10,383
你应该和我来
You should come with me.

121
00:07:10,383 --> 00:07:11,468
这样安全点
It's safer.

122
00:07:11,468 --> 00:07:12,260
不 等一下
No,slow down.

123
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,011
这里发生了什么?
What's going on here?

124
00:07:13,011 --> 00:07:13,928
是那些军人弄的
他们在找我们
It's the soldiers.They're after us.

125
00:07:13,928 --> 00:07:15,889
如果他们抓住我们
他们会把我们带走
If they catch us,they'll take us away.

126
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:17,849
带到哪? 什么军人?
这是什么地方?
Take us where?What soldiers?What is this place?

127
00:07:17,932 --> 00:07:19,601
你能闭嘴吗?
军人会听见我们的!
Will you shut up?The soldiers will hear us!

128
00:07:19,601 --> 00:07:20,727
这里到底发生了什么事?
What the hell is going on here?

129
00:07:20,727 --> 00:07:21,352
为什么我什么都记不得了?
Why can't I remember anything--

130
00:07:21,352 --> 00:07:23,188
我不知道 没人记得
I don't know.No one can.

131
00:07:23,188 --> 00:07:24,773
没人?
No one can?

132
00:07:24,773 --> 00:07:25,565
你看见过其他认了?
You've seen others?

133
00:07:25,565 --> 00:07:28,985
是的 除了那些军人以外
还有一两个人
Yes,one or two others,apart from the soldiers.

134
00:07:28,985 --> 00:07:29,986
她呢? 她在吗?
What about her?Was she there?

135
00:07:29,986 --> 00:07:31,488
不在
No.

136
00:07:31,488 --> 00:07:32,781
我得找到她
I have to find her.

137
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:34,282
为什么?
Why?

138
00:07:34,282 --> 00:07:35,492
我不知道 (但)这事很重要
I don't know.It's important.

139
00:07:35,492 --> 00:07:37,577
听着 军人现在很可能抓住她了
Look,the soldiers probably have her by now,okay?

140
00:07:37,577 --> 00:07:38,453
那 我们可以问他们吗?
Well,can we ask them?

141
00:07:38,453 --> 00:07:39,621
你疯了吗?
Are you crazy?

142
00:07:39,621 --> 00:07:41,790
如果那些军人看见你的话
他们会朝你开枪 然后把你带走
If the soldiers see you,they shoot you,take you away.

143
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,374
又是"被带走"
Again with the taking away.

144
00:07:43,374 --> 00:07:44,834
你应该和我一起躲起来
这样安全点
You should come hide with me.It's safe.

145
00:07:44,834 --> 00:07:45,919
我不能 我得继续找
I can't,I have to keep looking.

146
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,544
好吧 随便你
Fine,suit yourself.

147
00:07:46,544 --> 00:07:47,712
如果你把你自己弄死了
我才不管呢
If you get yourself killed,I don't care.

148
00:07:57,764 --> 00:08:00,558
(10小时前)
它开始得很突然 然后就...
(10 hours earlier)It started suddenly,and then it just...

149
00:08:00,558 --> 00:08:01,810
停止了
just stopped.

150
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:04,145
好的 很高兴你能告诉我
Okay,well,I appreciate you telling me.

151
00:08:04,145 --> 00:08:05,897
你不应该做点什么吗?
Aren't you going to do anything?

152
00:08:05,897 --> 00:08:07,982
老实说 我没看出
这(和这个病)有什么关联
To be honest,I don't see how it's relevant.

153
00:08:07,982 --> 00:08:10,026
这是一个新症状
我以为会很重要的
Well,it's a new symptom.I thought it might be important.

154
00:08:10,026 --> 00:08:13,863
我不觉得"膝盖的酸痛感"
和这个病有什么关系
I don't see how a "tingling sensation in your knees" relates to this condition,

155
00:08:13,863 --> 00:08:16,324
尤其是在你是唯一一个
有这个感觉的情况下
especially since you're the only one experiencing it.

156
00:08:16,324 --> 00:08:18,118
但是目前
Yeah,but so far.

157
00:08:18,118 --> 00:08:20,620
我们对这个病一无所知
I'm just saying,we don't know anything about this disease.

158
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:24,332
你现在能做的是放松 好吗?
Look,the best thing for you to do right now is try to relax,okay,

159
00:08:24,332 --> 00:08:26,668
然后让我工作
and let me do my work.

160
00:08:34,717 --> 00:08:35,718
给你
Here you go.

161
00:08:35,718 --> 00:08:37,720
谢谢
Thank you.

162
00:08:42,517 --> 00:08:44,519
Keller医生怎么说?
What did dr.Keller say?

163
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:46,187
哦 她会...
Oh,she's going to...

164
00:08:46,187 --> 00:08:47,814
考虑的
take it into consideration.

165
00:08:47,814 --> 00:08:49,983
她感谢我提供信息 还有...
Thanked me for my input and...

166
00:08:49,983 --> 00:08:52,277
你怎么样?
How you doing?

167
00:08:52,277 --> 00:08:53,903
我没事
I'm okay.

168
00:08:53,903 --> 00:08:55,905
Keller让她的小队很奋力的工作
Well,dr.Keller's got her team working pretty hard.

169
00:08:55,905 --> 00:08:57,031
我确定他们在试验很多东西
I'm sure they're trying a bunch of stuff.

170
00:08:57,031 --> 00:09:00,577
我确定他们很快会找到治疗的方法
I'm sure they'll come up with a way to beat this thing in no time.

171
00:09:03,747 --> 00:09:05,415
说实话 你没事吧?
Seriously,are you okay?

172
00:09:05,415 --> 00:09:07,584
是我的头疼
It's...my headache.

173
00:09:07,584 --> 00:09:09,461
现在越来越严重了
It's-it's getting worse.

174
00:09:09,461 --> 00:09:12,046
我能做什么吗?
Look,is there anything I can do?

175
00:09:12,046 --> 00:09:13,506
你能 嗯...
Could you,uh...

176
00:09:13,506 --> 00:09:16,551
叫护士给我一些茶吗?
ask the nurse to bring me some tea?

177
00:09:16,551 --> 00:09:20,180
这杯怎么了?
Well...what's wrong with this one?

178
00:09:20,555 --> 00:09:22,265
哦...
Oh...

179
00:09:22,265 --> 00:09:23,933
对
right.

180
00:09:28,396 --> 00:09:29,481
Marie 怎么...
Marie?What'S...

181
00:09:29,481 --> 00:09:30,523
怎么了?
what's going on?

182
00:09:30,523 --> 00:09:31,399
我不知道
I don't know.

183
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:33,526
我就是有点头晕
I just got really dizzy.

184
00:09:39,282 --> 00:09:42,786
你是说这个病可以透过防化服?
are you telling us that the infection has breached hazmat protocol?

185
00:09:42,786 --> 00:09:44,704
我不完全确定
I'm not entirely sure.

186
00:09:44,704 --> 00:09:47,082
有可能她之前已经暴露了
It's possible she could have been previously exposed,

187
00:09:47,082 --> 00:09:52,170
但这就意味着这个病已经传播得
比我们想象的要广得多
but that would mean it's already spread much farther among than general population than we thought.

188
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:55,715
我已经让下班的医务人员
在城内进行随机的血液测试
I've got off-duty medical personnel conducting random blood tests around the city

189
00:09:55,715 --> 00:09:57,509
以了解传播的状况
just to get a sense of where we're at.

190
00:09:57,509 --> 00:10:00,053
我们确定它是从大陆上来的吗?
Have we confirmed it came from the mainland?

191
00:10:00,053 --> 00:10:04,099
植物学部门带回来的
土壤和岩石样本呈阴性
Well,the plant and soil samples brought back by the botany department were negative,

192
00:10:04,099 --> 00:10:06,559
但大陆看来是最有可能的源头
but it still seems like the most likely point of origin.

193
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:07,811
数据库查得怎么样了?
What about the database?

194
00:10:07,811 --> 00:10:10,522
还没有找到匹配 但我还没放弃
I haven't found a match yet,but I'm still looking.

195
00:10:10,522 --> 00:10:12,649
还有一件事
There is one more thing.

196
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:17,278
既然我们不知道
这个病的症状和传播特征
Since we have no idea what this disease does,or how it's spread,

197
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:19,739
即使我们的隔离措施有作一些用
or even if our containment measures are having any effect,

198
00:10:19,739 --> 00:10:24,410
我还是建议立即停止
所有的星门活动
I recommend we suspend all gate travel immediately.

199
00:10:26,871 --> 00:10:29,165
谢谢你 医生
Thank you,doctor.

200
00:10:39,801 --> 00:10:40,677
嘿
Hey...

201
00:10:40,677 --> 00:10:42,720
你感觉怎么样了
how you feeling?

202
00:10:43,346 --> 00:10:45,473
我.. 不知道
I-I don't know.

203
00:10:45,473 --> 00:10:46,850
哦 他们送来了晚餐
Oh.Well,they brought dinner.

204
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,852
索尔斯伯利牛肉饼相当好
(以碎牛肉加各种佐料煮成或炸成的食物)
This salisbury steak's actually quite good.

205
00:10:48,852 --> 00:10:52,647
哦 我问了Keller医生你朋友
Baxter博士的情况
Oh,and by the way,I asked dr.Keller about your friend,dr.Baxter.

206
00:10:52,647 --> 00:10:56,568
她说他在睡觉 但是已经退烧了
She says he's asleep,but apparently the fever's down.

207
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,194
谁?
Who?

208
00:10:58,194 --> 00:11:02,365
Baxter博士 他是叫这个名字吧?
就是你队里的那个人
Dr.Baxter.That's his name,right,the guy on your team?

209
00:11:03,533 --> 00:11:05,618
Katie?
Katie?

210
00:11:06,828 --> 00:11:09,205
我在哪?
Where am I?

211
00:11:09,289 --> 00:11:12,459
你什么意思? 你在医务室
我带你来的记得吗?
What do you mean?You're in the infirmary.I brought you here,remember?

212
00:11:12,792 --> 00:11:15,795
你是谁?
Who are you?

213
00:11:20,425 --> 00:11:23,344
现时
present

214
00:11:25,221 --> 00:11:26,848
嘿
Hey!

215
00:11:26,848 --> 00:11:28,183
别动
Hold it right there.

216
00:11:28,183 --> 00:11:30,310
我不想制造麻烦 我只是...
I don't want to cause any trouble.I just--

217
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,485
把他和其他人关在一起
yeah,put him with the others.

218
00:11:38,485 --> 00:11:39,319
快点 把他带走
Get him out of here.

219
00:11:39,319 --> 00:11:41,196
是的长官
Yes,sir.

220
00:11:56,169 --> 00:11:57,378
8小时前
8 hours earlier

221
00:11:57,378 --> 00:11:59,422
有什么消息?
well,what's the word?

222
00:11:59,422 --> 00:12:01,466
随机测试的结果出来了
Well,the random test results came back.

223
00:12:01,466 --> 00:12:06,262
在不同区域不同部门
的六个人都呈阳性
Six different people working in six different areas of the city,all positive.

224
00:12:06,262 --> 00:12:07,972
听上去不是很好
That doesn't sound very promising.

225
00:12:07,972 --> 00:12:11,434
是呀 要不是统计学上的奇迹
就是整个基地都暴露了
Well,it's either a statistical miracle,or the entire base has been exposed.

226
00:12:11,434 --> 00:12:14,229
我们正在进行测试来证实
但是看上去不太好
We're running more tests to confirm it,but it doesn't look good.

227
00:12:14,229 --> 00:12:16,022
我不知道你怎么样
但是我感觉很好
I don't know about you,but I feel fine.

228
00:12:16,022 --> 00:12:17,982
我也是 这就是问题所在
Well,me too,and that's the problem.

229
00:12:17,982 --> 00:12:20,151
如果第一批症状不是
(在感染后)立即出现
If there is a delay before the first symptoms appear,

230
00:12:20,151 --> 00:12:23,488
它有可能在我们知道之前
已经传播到任何地方去了
it could've spread anywhere before we even knew what was happening.

231
00:12:23,488 --> 00:12:26,491
我已经告知SGC
我们暂停了所有星门使用
I've informed stargate command that we're suspending gate operations.

232
00:12:26,491 --> 00:12:28,368
Carter上校 我是Keller医生
Colonel Carter,this is dr.Keller.

233
00:12:28,368 --> 00:12:29,160
请讲
Go ahead.

234
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,870
我正在把Katie Brown和其他3个
I'm sending you scans on Katie Brown,

235
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:34,874
已经开始出现失忆症的
病人的扫描结果发给你
as well three other patients who are beginning to show signs of amnesia.

236
00:12:34,874 --> 00:12:39,379
他们的大脑颞叶中部都
聚集着大量的被感染的细胞
All of them show large concentrations of affected cells in the medial temporal lobe.

237
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:42,257
看上去这个细菌使细胞产生一种
It looks like the bacteria is causing these cells to produce a hormone

238
00:12:42,257 --> 00:12:46,511
能干扰大脑访问短期记忆的荷尔蒙
that interferes with the brain's ability to access episodic memory.

239
00:12:46,511 --> 00:12:48,471
有多严重?
How bad are we talking?

240
00:12:48,471 --> 00:12:51,391
病情恶化的速度因人而异
Well,rate of deterioration seems to vary from patient to patient,

241
00:12:51,391 --> 00:12:54,519
但是在所有的病例中
症状都在不停发展
but,in all cases,it looks like it's progressive,meaning,

242
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:58,356
也就是说 他们越久得不到治疗
病情就会越糟糕
the longer they go without treatment,the worse it gets.

243
00:12:58,356 --> 00:13:01,151
很快他们就会连名字都记不得了
Pretty soon,they won't be able to remember their own names.

244
00:13:01,151 --> 00:13:04,320
你说最先出现的症状是头痛和头晕
You said the first symptoms were headaches and dizziness.

245
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,697
是的 没错
Yeah,that's right.

246
00:13:05,697 --> 00:13:09,159
多久以后会出现记忆丧失的症状?
How long after they appeared before the first signs of memory loss?

247
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:14,205
这因人而异 平均约6小时
Again,it seems to vary,but you're looking at an average of about six hours.

248
00:13:14,205 --> 00:13:16,166
医生你怎么样了? 有什么症状吗?
What about you,doc,showing any signs?

249
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:19,461
头痛半小时前开始了
Yeah,the headaches started half an hour ago.

250
00:13:20,086 --> 00:13:22,046
好吧 继续搜索数据库
All right,keep searching the database.

251
00:13:22,046 --> 00:13:24,007
我还是觉得那是我们
最可能找到决绝方案的地方
It still think it's our best bet to find a solution.

252
00:13:24,007 --> 00:13:26,760
我也想啊
但是如果这些数字没错的话
I'd love to,but if we're right about these numbers,

253
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,345
我这里很快会人满为患
I'm about to get overrun with a lot of new patients.

254
00:13:29,345 --> 00:13:32,265
这里已经很拥挤了
It's already pretty crowded in here.

255
00:13:32,265 --> 00:13:33,349
餐厅
Mess hall.

256
00:13:33,349 --> 00:13:35,226
我们可以把那里清空
做成临时病房
We can clear it out and make a temporary ward.

257
00:13:35,226 --> 00:13:36,144
嗯 这是个好主意
Yeah,that's a good idea.

258
00:13:36,144 --> 00:13:39,814
至少那里能给每个人提供治疗场所
At the very least,it'll consolidate everyone in one place for treatment.

259
00:13:39,814 --> 00:13:41,316
就这么办
Do it.

260
00:13:58,416 --> 00:13:59,209
你没事吧?
Are you all right?

261
00:13:59,209 --> 00:14:01,086
没事
Yeah.

262
00:14:01,669 --> 00:14:04,047
我在哪?
Where am I?

263
00:14:04,047 --> 00:14:08,051
我们本希望你可以告诉我们
We were hoping you could tell us.

264
00:14:08,051 --> 00:14:10,762
你们是什么人?
Who are all you people?

265
00:14:10,762 --> 00:14:12,222
我们不知道
We don't know.

266
00:14:12,222 --> 00:14:14,307
我们什么都不记得了
None of us can remember anything.

267
00:14:14,307 --> 00:14:16,643
外面发生了什么? 你看见什么了?
What's happening out there?What did you see?

268
00:14:16,643 --> 00:14:18,436
没什么
Nothing.

269
00:14:18,436 --> 00:14:20,146
只有...
It was just...

270
00:14:20,146 --> 00:14:21,981
空的走廊
empty hallways.

271
00:14:21,981 --> 00:14:23,817
我是怎么到这里来的?
How did I get here?

272
00:14:23,817 --> 00:14:25,777
军人把你带来的
The soldiers brought you.

273
00:14:25,777 --> 00:14:27,445
为什么?
Why?

274
00:14:27,445 --> 00:14:29,280
他们把每个人带到这来
They bring everyone here.

275
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,450
他们说这是为我们好
They say it's for our own protection.

276
00:14:32,992 --> 00:14:33,827
别浪费时间了
Don't waste your time.

277
00:14:33,827 --> 00:14:35,411
不会打开的
It won't open.

278
00:14:35,411 --> 00:14:37,372
他们为什么对我们这样?
Why are they doing this to us?

279
00:14:37,372 --> 00:14:40,250
为什么没人记得东西?
Look,why can't anyone remember?

280
00:14:41,543 --> 00:14:43,086
我的...
My...

281
00:14:43,086 --> 00:14:45,088
那个电脑
the computer.

282
00:14:45,547 --> 00:14:47,090
我的电脑到哪去了?
Where's my computer?

283
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:49,134
你来的时候没有带电脑
It wasn't with you when they brought you here.

284
00:14:49,134 --> 00:14:50,802
怎么了?
Why?

285
00:14:50,802 --> 00:14:51,845
我得找到一个人
I have to find someone.

286
00:14:51,845 --> 00:14:54,931
一个女的
It's a woman.

287
00:14:55,432 --> 00:14:57,058
Teyla
Teyla.

288
00:14:57,058 --> 00:14:59,894
你们知道那是谁吗?
Do you know who that is?

289
00:15:02,689 --> 00:15:06,651
你们有人认识Teyla吗?
Does anyone here know teyla?

290
00:15:06,901 --> 00:15:09,487
任何人?
Anyone?

291
00:15:11,698 --> 00:15:15,368
这城市不是有自动锁闭系统
来阻止这种事发生吗?
I thought this city had some sort of automatic lockdown to prevent stuff like this.

292
00:15:15,368 --> 00:15:16,911
是的
It does.

293
00:15:16,911 --> 00:15:18,413
那么
Oh,yeah?

294
00:15:18,413 --> 00:15:19,664
怎么回事呢?
What happened?

295
00:15:19,664 --> 00:15:22,208
你问我?
You're asking me?

296
00:15:22,417 --> 00:15:24,586
你头疼吗?
you got a headache?

297
00:15:24,586 --> 00:15:28,006
我猜只是时间问题
Yeah,I guess it was just a matter of time.

298
00:15:29,591 --> 00:15:32,010
- John?
- 我没事
-John?
-I'm fine.

299
00:15:33,219 --> 00:15:34,137
嗨
Hey.

300
00:15:34,137 --> 00:15:36,306
你感觉怎么样?
How you feeling?

301
00:15:36,306 --> 00:15:37,807
我没事
I am fine.

302
00:15:37,807 --> 00:15:38,892
有什么症状吗?
Any symptoms?

303
00:15:38,892 --> 00:15:40,810
没 还没有
No,none yet.

304
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:43,563
我也是
Me neither.

305
00:15:44,063 --> 00:15:45,356
怎么了?
What is it?

306
00:15:45,356 --> 00:15:48,151
他们怎么知道我们都感染了?
How do they know we're all infected?

307
00:15:48,151 --> 00:15:50,612
我的血样没有被测试过
My blood wasn't part of the sample that was tested.

308
00:15:50,612 --> 00:15:51,321
我的也没有
Nor was mine.

309
00:15:51,321 --> 00:15:53,740
虽然我们没被检测过
但是很可能每个人都暴露了
Even so,it is likely we were exposed.

310
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,618
又怎么样? 暴露不代表我们会得病
So?Being exposed doesn't mean you've got it.

311
00:15:56,618 --> 00:15:58,912
也许这个病不会影响所有人
Maybe it doesn't affect everybody the same way,

312
00:15:58,912 --> 00:16:01,664
我只知道我自己感觉很好
and all I know is I feel great.

313
00:16:01,664 --> 00:16:03,583
我也是
So do I.

314
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:06,044
也许你应该让Keller医生知道
Perhaps you should make dr.Keller aware of this.

315
00:16:06,044 --> 00:16:07,504
嗯
Yeah.

316
00:16:07,504 --> 00:16:09,297
好的
Okay.

317
00:16:14,594 --> 00:16:16,888
借过
Excuse me.

318
00:16:18,515 --> 00:16:20,767
Keller医生
Dr.Keller...

319
00:16:21,017 --> 00:16:22,227
我得和你谈谈
I need to talk to you.

320
00:16:22,227 --> 00:16:24,771
我现在有点忙
I'm a little busy right now.

321
00:16:24,771 --> 00:16:27,232
我没有生病
I'm not sick.

322
00:16:27,232 --> 00:16:29,150
如果你足够幸运没有被暴露的话
Well,if you're lucky enough not to be exposed,

323
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,693
你到这来就全完蛋了
you just blew it by coming in here.

324
00:16:30,693 --> 00:16:32,362
不是 我知道我暴露了
No,I know I've been exposed.

325
00:16:32,362 --> 00:16:34,614
今天和我一起工作的人都生病了
People I've been working with all day have been getting sick,

326
00:16:34,614 --> 00:16:36,032
但是我什么感觉也没有
but I'm not feeling anything.

327
00:16:36,032 --> 00:16:37,325
Teyla也没有
Neither is Teyla.

328
00:16:37,325 --> 00:16:39,202
你认为你有某种免疫能力?
You think you might have some kind of immunity?

329
00:16:39,202 --> 00:16:40,495
你是医生
You're the doctor.

330
00:16:40,495 --> 00:16:41,496
好的
Okay.

331
00:16:41,496 --> 00:16:43,331
我需要你的血样
Well,I'm going to need a sample of your blood.

332
00:16:43,331 --> 00:16:45,792
随便采
Take as much as you need.

333
00:16:55,343 --> 00:16:56,386
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

334
00:16:56,386 --> 00:16:58,304
我一定要想办法记得
I have to remember somehow.

335
00:16:58,304 --> 00:17:01,307
我已经感觉到记忆在消失
I already feel certain things slipping away.

336
00:17:05,562 --> 00:17:06,896
好的 那你现在在做什么?
All right,now what are you doing?

337
00:17:06,896 --> 00:17:08,148
(想法)逃出去
Getting out of here.

338
00:17:08,148 --> 00:17:09,524
好了 各位
All right,everyone!

339
00:17:09,524 --> 00:17:11,109
注意听
Listen up!

340
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:13,695
我要尽快逃出去
I need to escape quickly!

341
00:17:13,695 --> 00:17:15,155
有人知道我怎么能办到吗?
Does anyone know how I can do that?

342
00:17:15,155 --> 00:17:17,282
你不可以走
You can't just leave.

343
00:17:17,282 --> 00:17:18,199
为什么不?
Why not?

344
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:19,868
那些军人怎么办?
What about the soldiers?

345
00:17:19,868 --> 00:17:21,494
我们得对付他们
We're just going to have to deal with them.

346
00:17:21,494 --> 00:17:23,788
很抱歉 就当我疯了
但是我不信任他们
I'm sorry,call me crazy,but I don't exactly trust them.

347
00:17:23,788 --> 00:17:25,623
但这并不是说我们可以跑出去
That doesn't mean we should be running loose.

348
00:17:25,623 --> 00:17:27,000
我们不知道外面有什么
We have no idea what's out there.

349
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,628
听着 这肯定是什么东西造成的
Look,something caused this to happen,all right?

350
00:17:30,628 --> 00:17:32,380
我们没法在这里找到解决方法
And we're not going to figure it out from in here.

351
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:35,967
在外面什么地方 有一个女的...
Somewhere out there,there is a woman that...

352
00:17:36,301 --> 00:17:38,303
一个女的叫....
a woman named...

353
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:41,723
- Teyla
- Teyla 对 谢谢你
- Teyla.
- Teyla,right,thank you.

354
00:17:41,723 --> 00:17:43,516
我想她知道东西
I think she knows something.

355
00:17:43,516 --> 00:17:45,185
什么东西?
What?

356
00:17:45,185 --> 00:17:46,102
我不知道
I don't know.

357
00:17:46,102 --> 00:17:48,021
我们得逃出去然后找到答案
We got to get out there and find out.

358
00:17:48,021 --> 00:17:49,606
我想我们应该听他的
I think we should listen to him.

359
00:17:49,606 --> 00:17:50,940
为什么?
Why?

360
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,276
他说的有道理
It makes sense.

361
00:17:53,276 --> 00:17:55,737
为什么军人不告诉我们
发生了什么?
Why haven't the soldiers told us what's happened?

362
00:17:55,737 --> 00:18:00,366
为什么没有任何通告或者援助?
Why haven't there been any announcements,or any help on the way?

363
00:18:00,742 --> 00:18:04,454
也许他们知道的不比我们多
Maybe they don't know any more than we do.

364
00:18:07,499 --> 00:18:10,376
我们需要一个计划
We need a plan.

365
00:18:11,711 --> 00:18:12,962
他们放你出来了?
They let you out?

366
00:18:12,962 --> 00:18:16,424
第二批随机血液测试
的结果出来了 全是阳性
Well,the second set of random blood tests just came back,all positive.

367
00:18:16,424 --> 00:18:19,219
待在医务室的隔离区
已经没什么必要了
Didn't see much point in quarantining the infirmary anymore.

368
00:18:19,219 --> 00:18:20,804
你有什么症状吗?
You showing any signs?

369
00:18:20,804 --> 00:18:21,721
头痛
Headache?

370
00:18:21,721 --> 00:18:23,264
我也是
Yeah,same here.

371
00:18:23,264 --> 00:18:25,683
我五块钱赌你先开始失去记忆
Five bucks says you start losing your memories first.

372
00:18:25,683 --> 00:18:27,560
Rodney...
Rodney...

373
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,105
好的 我们有食物 水和毯子
all right,we've got food,water,and blankets.

374
00:18:30,105 --> 00:18:32,690
我们没有足够的床
但是可以凑合一下
We don't have enough beds,but we're just going to have to make do.

375
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:37,529
我们得考虑要求
非必要人员到餐厅报告
We may need to think about ordering all non-essential personnel to report to the mess hall.

376
00:18:37,529 --> 00:18:39,155
他们最后肯定要到那去的
I mean,they're going to wind up there anyways,

377
00:18:39,155 --> 00:18:41,324
这样的话 我们就不会有
没有记忆的人在走廊里乱跑
and,this way,we won't have people with no memories wandering the hallways.

378
00:18:41,324 --> 00:18:42,325
我就在担心这个
That's what I'm worried about.

379
00:18:42,325 --> 00:18:46,287
我会派Lorne和一个小队
去确保命令执行
I'll send lorne and a team out,make sure those orders are followed.

380
00:18:46,871 --> 00:18:48,706
这些是Neves博士给的
These are from dr.Neves.

381
00:18:48,706 --> 00:18:50,125
兴奋剂
They're stimulants.

382
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:52,460
他认为这可以帮助减慢记忆丧失
He thinks they may slow the effects of the memory loss.

383
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:55,422
这只是权宜之计 但是至少
可以为我们争取几个小时
It's just a stopgap,but at least it may buy us a few hours.

384
00:18:55,422 --> 00:18:56,256
我们知道这个东西的成分吗?
Do we know what's in these?

385
00:18:56,256 --> 00:18:59,008
- 我对很多东西过敏...
- 快吃吧
-Because I'm allergic to a lot of--
-take it.

386
00:18:59,384 --> 00:19:01,845
把这个发给Lorne和他的小队
Hand these out to Lorne and his men.

387
00:19:01,845 --> 00:19:03,513
还有一件事
One more thing.

388
00:19:03,513 --> 00:19:07,100
我叫Zelanka博士
把星门的控制水晶拿走了
I've ordered dr.Zelanka to remove the gate's main control crystal.

389
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:11,855
不管发生什么 我们都不能把病
传播到这个星系其他地方或者地球
No matter what happens,we cannot risk spreading this disease elsewhere in the galaxy,or to earth.

390
00:19:11,855 --> 00:19:15,233
如果我们也失去了记忆怎么办?
And what happens when we all start losing our memory?

391
00:19:15,733 --> 00:19:19,446
Keller医生会在那之前
找到解决方法的
Dr.Keller will come up with something before that happens.

392
00:19:24,409 --> 00:19:25,535
嗨
Hey...

393
00:19:25,535 --> 00:19:27,620
所有人不是都送去餐厅了吗?
I thought we were moving everyone to the mess hall.

394
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,205
他们我们最严重的病例
He's our most advanced case.

395
00:19:29,205 --> 00:19:30,540
他的生命体征太不稳定了
His vitals are too unstable.

396
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,958
我能帮你吗?
What can I do for you?

397
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:33,793
在我只是想知道
你有没有找到什么?
I was just wondering if you found anything.

398
00:19:33,793 --> 00:19:35,712
你什么意思?
What do you mean?

399
00:19:35,712 --> 00:19:38,548
我什么症状都没有 记得吗?
I'm not showing any sign of the disease,remember?

400
00:19:38,548 --> 00:19:43,762
哦 可能你对这个病自然免疫
Oh,well,it's possible you could have some sort of natural immunity.

401
00:19:43,762 --> 00:19:48,016
- 医生...
- 我要给你采一份血样
-Doc...doc...
-I'm going to take a sample of your blood--

402
00:19:48,016 --> 00:19:51,144
医生... 你已经做过了
You've already done that.

403
00:19:51,144 --> 00:19:53,646
我也开始失忆了 是吧?
It's happening to me,isn't it?

404
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,608
医生 他在抽搐
Doctor,he's convulsing!

405
00:19:59,903 --> 00:20:01,112
好 嗯...
Okay,uh...

406
00:20:01,112 --> 00:20:02,489
给他 嗯...
give him,uh...

407
00:20:02,489 --> 00:20:05,074
四毫克Medazilam
m-medazilam,four milligrams.

408
00:20:05,074 --> 00:20:07,869
他进入心室震颤 我需要除颤器车
He's in v-fib.I need a crash cart.

409
00:20:10,622 --> 00:20:12,916
充电到200
Charge it to 200.

410
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,502
清开
Clear.

411
00:20:16,586 --> 00:20:19,005
充电到300
Charge it to 300.

412
00:20:21,549 --> 00:20:23,843
清开
Clear.

413
00:20:35,396 --> 00:20:37,232
快走 快走
Go,go!

414
00:20:38,441 --> 00:20:40,401
停!
Stop!

415
00:20:40,735 --> 00:20:42,862
停!
Stop!

416
00:20:44,322 --> 00:20:46,282
这边
This way!

417
00:20:56,418 --> 00:20:58,420
好了 我想我们安全了
Okay,I think we're clear.

418
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,671
哦 谢天谢地
Oh,thank god.

419
00:20:59,671 --> 00:21:01,965
我都快喘不过气来
My lungs were about to give out.

420
00:21:01,965 --> 00:21:03,133
下一步怎么办?
So,what next?

421
00:21:03,133 --> 00:21:04,217
我不知道
I don't know.

422
00:21:04,217 --> 00:21:05,718
我们怎么找到她?
How do we find her?

423
00:21:05,718 --> 00:21:06,803
谁?
Who?

424
00:21:06,803 --> 00:21:09,639
Teyla 我们刚刚
冒着生命危险就是要找她
Teyla.The one we just risked our lives for.

425
00:21:09,639 --> 00:21:11,558
对 对
Right,right.

426
00:21:11,558 --> 00:21:13,059
我不知道(怎么找)
I don't know.

427
00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:15,437
那好 我们一间一间找
All right,we'll just have to search room by room.

428
00:21:15,437 --> 00:21:19,983
这地方能有多大呢?
I mean,how big could this place possibly be?

429
00:21:38,251 --> 00:21:39,711
你要把我们带到哪去?
Where are you taking us?

430
00:21:39,711 --> 00:21:41,045
我已经告诉过你了 餐厅
I already told you.The mess hall.

431
00:21:41,045 --> 00:21:42,714
我不要到那去
I don't want to go there.

432
00:21:42,714 --> 00:21:43,798
放松
Just relax.

433
00:21:43,798 --> 00:21:46,342
我知道你很害怕
但是你得相信我
I know you're scared,but you're just going to have to trust me.

434
00:21:46,342 --> 00:21:48,553
这是为了你好
It's for your own good.

435
00:21:49,429 --> 00:21:52,515
谢谢你一路无声的陪伴
So much for coming quietly.

436
00:21:53,099 --> 00:21:55,101
嘿...
Hey...

437
00:21:55,101 --> 00:21:57,854
餐厅是这边
mess hall's this way.

438
00:21:57,854 --> 00:22:00,273
对
Right.

439
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,609
别这样看着我
Don't look at me that way.

440
00:22:02,609 --> 00:22:05,487
在这地方很容易走错
It's easy to get turned around in this place.

441
00:22:10,116 --> 00:22:13,244
Lorne少校正在把
一些走散的人带过来
Major Lorne's picking up some more stragglers.

442
00:22:13,244 --> 00:22:15,121
他们遇到一些阻力
We're starting to get a little resistance.

443
00:22:15,121 --> 00:22:16,873
是啊 人们开始失去记忆了
Yeah,they're starting to lose their memories.

444
00:22:16,873 --> 00:22:19,626
他们可能不能理解
为什么有士兵在找他们
They probably can't understand why soldiers are after them.

445
00:22:19,626 --> 00:22:23,129
所以我叫Lorne带人
去军械库拿了击昏枪
That's why I told him to take his men to the armory and equip them with stunners.

446
00:22:23,129 --> 00:22:25,799
我不太赞同向自己人开枪
I'm not sure I like the idea of us shooting at our own people.

447
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:27,550
但我们也没有选择
Well,we may not have a choice.

448
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:29,052
我希望你是对的
Yeah,I suppose you're right.

449
00:22:29,052 --> 00:22:33,139
很快外面就会有一些惊慌失措的人
Pretty soon,there's going to be some panicked,confused people out there.

450
00:22:33,139 --> 00:22:35,558
好的 继续
Okay,carry on.

451
00:22:35,558 --> 00:22:37,477
什么?
What?

452
00:22:37,477 --> 00:22:39,729
和我来
Come with me.

453
00:22:48,947 --> 00:22:51,199
你可能要少吃一点那个东西 少校
You might want to go easy on that stuff,major.

454
00:22:51,199 --> 00:22:53,660
长官我们要尽可能的延缓症状发生
Sir,we need to delay this thing as much as possible.

455
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,411
如果我们都失忆了
(这里)就没有救了
If we all go,there's no coming back.

456
00:22:55,411 --> 00:22:56,996
嗯 我知道
Yeah,I know.

457
00:22:56,996 --> 00:22:58,248
这就是我要和你谈的
That's what I want to talk to you about.

458
00:22:58,248 --> 00:23:00,375
我有一个主意
(注意这个细节)
I got an idea.

459
00:23:01,751 --> 00:23:02,544
你不觉得我们走过这条路了吗?
Didn't we come this way before?

460
00:23:02,544 --> 00:23:03,837
没有
No.

461
00:23:03,837 --> 00:23:06,172
你确定?
Are you sure?

462
00:23:06,172 --> 00:23:08,049
不确定
No.

463
00:23:08,049 --> 00:23:10,635
我有办法了
I have an idea.

464
00:23:13,471 --> 00:23:14,597
你在做什么?
What are you doing?

465
00:23:14,597 --> 00:23:17,016
如果我们又走到这
我们就知道我们已经来过了
If we come back here,we'll know we've been this way before.

466
00:23:17,016 --> 00:23:21,729
当然要假定我们记得
这个标记是我们放在这的
Presuming of course that we remember that we're the ones who put it there in the first place.

467
00:23:24,983 --> 00:23:26,609
我知道你们在那
I know you're out there.

468
00:23:26,609 --> 00:23:30,947
放下你们的武器 然后慢慢出来
Drop your weapons and come out slowly.

469
00:23:40,457 --> 00:23:43,084
戴眼镜的小个子
Little guy with glasses.

470
00:23:44,794 --> 00:23:45,587
你在做什么?
What are you doing?

471
00:23:45,587 --> 00:23:47,172
我认识他
Hey,I know him.

472
00:23:47,172 --> 00:23:49,716
别开枪
Don't shoot.

473
00:23:50,216 --> 00:23:52,469
我没有武器
I don't have any weapons.

474
00:23:52,469 --> 00:23:53,636
你是谁?
Who are you?

475
00:23:53,636 --> 00:23:55,013
我们被军人抓住了
We were captured by the soldiers.

476
00:23:55,013 --> 00:23:56,598
然后我们逃出来了
We escaped.

477
00:23:56,598 --> 00:23:58,808
真的?
Really?

478
00:23:58,808 --> 00:24:00,351
等一下
Wait a second.

479
00:24:00,351 --> 00:24:01,853
那是什么?
What is that?

480
00:24:02,228 --> 00:24:02,854
是我找到的
I found it.

481
00:24:02,854 --> 00:24:04,731
让我看看
Let me see.

482
00:24:04,731 --> 00:24:05,482
那是什么?
What is it?

483
00:24:05,482 --> 00:24:08,067
我不知道 但是它很重要
I don't know,but something tells me it's important.

484
00:24:08,067 --> 00:24:09,486
为什么?
Why?

485
00:24:09,486 --> 00:24:12,572
不知道
I don't know.

486
00:24:19,954 --> 00:24:22,082
嗨 你怎么知道怎么用的
Hey,how did you know to do that?

487
00:24:22,082 --> 00:24:23,124
我不知道 我就是会用
I don't know.I just did.

488
00:24:23,124 --> 00:24:24,626
就是她 Teyla
Well,that's her,teyla.

489
00:24:24,626 --> 00:24:27,003
你认识她?
You know her?

490
00:24:27,003 --> 00:24:29,798
不完全是
Well,not exactly.

491
00:24:29,798 --> 00:24:32,759
我们正在找她
我们认为她可以帮助我们
We're looking for her.We think she can help us.

492
00:24:34,636 --> 00:24:37,305
这里说 "找她"
it says,"find her.

493
00:24:37,305 --> 00:24:40,391
我们要怎么找呢?
How are we going to do that?

494
00:24:45,313 --> 00:24:47,649
这是我要给你们看的
This is what I wanted to show you.

495
00:24:47,649 --> 00:24:50,193
这是造成我们生病的细菌?
This is the bacteria that is causing our disease?

496
00:24:50,193 --> 00:24:53,029
不完全是 但是很相似
Not exactly,but it's very similar.

497
00:24:53,029 --> 00:24:55,156
你在数据库里找到这个的?
And you found this in the database?

498
00:24:55,156 --> 00:24:57,909
我停止搜索了
I stopped looking in the database.

499
00:24:57,909 --> 00:25:02,580
我觉得Teyla和Ronon是目前
唯一没有感染的人是有原因的
I knew there was a reason why teyla and ronon are the only people who've tested negative so far,

500
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,416
我们对Satedan人了解的还不够多
and we don't have a lot of information on the satedans,

501
00:25:04,416 --> 00:25:07,961
所以我就开始查阅Beckett博士
关于Athosian(Teyla的种族)的记录
so I started looking through dr.Beckett's records on the athosians.

502
00:25:07,961 --> 00:25:10,922
这是10岁男孩的血样
This is a blood sample taken from a 10-year-old boy.

503
00:25:10,922 --> 00:25:14,509
他生了一种病  叫...
He was suffering from something called,um...

504
00:25:16,594 --> 00:25:18,430
我写下来了
I wrote it down.

505
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:20,098
Kirsan热病?
Kirsan fever?

506
00:25:20,098 --> 00:25:21,975
对  就是它
Yeah,that's it.

507
00:25:21,975 --> 00:25:25,145
这是飞马系中一种儿童常见病
It is a common childhood ailment throughout the galaxy.

508
00:25:25,145 --> 00:25:27,313
我8岁时就得过
I had it when I was eight.

509
00:25:27,313 --> 00:25:28,606
我10岁得的
I had it when I was 10.

510
00:25:28,606 --> 00:25:31,025
但这不可能是同一种病
But this cannot be the same disease.

511
00:25:31,025 --> 00:25:34,279
Kirsan热病不感染成人
也不会让人失忆
Kirsan fever does not affect adults,nor does it cause memory loss.

512
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:39,909
这也许是事实
但这两个细菌的结构太相似了
Well,that may be true,but the structure of the bacteria is too similar to ignore.

513
00:25:39,909 --> 00:25:41,870
它们一定有些联系的
They have to be related somehow.

514
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:43,288
等下
Wait a minute.

515
00:25:43,288 --> 00:25:44,914
或许他们是一样的
Maybe they are the same.

516
00:25:44,914 --> 00:25:47,792
这就可以解释为什么
传感器没有检测出来了
That would explain why the sensors didn't identify it as a threat.

517
00:25:47,792 --> 00:25:49,002
那怎么可能?
How is that possible?

518
00:25:49,002 --> 00:25:50,044
想一想
Well,think about it.

519
00:25:50,044 --> 00:25:53,006
在我们来之前这星球没有星门
I mean,this planet didn't have a stargate until we came here.

520
00:25:53,006 --> 00:25:56,843
或许在古人最早探索这个地方的时候
Maybe when the ancients were first scouting this place,

521
00:25:56,843 --> 00:25:59,220
他们偶然的带来了这个...
they accidentally brought this,uh...

522
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,513
Kirsan热病
kirsan fever with them.

523
00:26:00,513 --> 00:26:02,766
它困在这里  过了1万年之后
It got trapped here,and over the course of 10,000 years,

524
00:26:02,766 --> 00:26:05,059
它变异了  造成我们现在的状况
it mutated to cause the symptoms we're now experiencing.

525
00:26:05,059 --> 00:26:07,061
这也可以解释为什么
你和Ronon为什么没有感染
That would also explain why you and ronon aren't affected.

526
00:26:07,061 --> 00:26:09,439
你小的时候就有了抗体
You have antibodies built up from when you were young.

527
00:26:09,439 --> 00:26:14,444
- 如果他们有抗体  那么...
- 用反向工程找解药要花上几个月
Well,if they have the antibodies,then-- it would take months to reverse-engineer a cure.

528
00:26:14,444 --> 00:26:16,696
我连那能不能成功都不确定
I mean,I'm not even sure it's possible.

529
00:26:16,696 --> 00:26:18,573
Enchuri植物的汁液
The sap of the enchuri plant.

530
00:26:18,573 --> 00:26:21,409
我的人几代都用它抵抗Kirsan热病
My people have used it for generations to combat kirsan fever.

531
00:26:21,409 --> 00:26:25,622
那很有效  并不需要很多
It is highly effective and not much is needed.

532
00:26:25,622 --> 00:26:26,623
我们去搞一些来
Let's go get some.

533
00:26:26,623 --> 00:26:27,791
坐Jumper去
Take a jumper.

534
00:26:27,791 --> 00:26:29,375
等下
Wait a minute.

535
00:26:29,375 --> 00:26:31,544
你使关闭了星际之门  记得吗?
You disabled the gate,remember?

536
00:26:31,544 --> 00:26:35,882
你要Zelenka拿走了控制水晶
You ordered dr.Zelenka to take the control crystal.

537
00:26:35,882 --> 00:26:38,676
他把它放在哪了?
Where did he put it?

538
00:26:40,762 --> 00:26:43,640
Zelenka  我是Sheppard  回答我
Zelenka,this is sheppard,come in.

539
00:26:44,224 --> 00:26:46,392
检查那里的房间
Check out the rooms down there and there.

540
00:26:46,392 --> 00:26:48,812
我要走这个区域在10分钟内清空
I want this section cleared out in 10 minutes.

541
00:26:48,812 --> 00:26:50,146
Lorne  回答我
Lorne,come in.

542
00:26:50,146 --> 00:26:51,189
是的  长官  继续说
Yes,sir.Go ahead.

543
00:26:51,189 --> 00:26:52,816
你看到过Zelenka吗?
Have you seen zelenka?

544
00:26:52,816 --> 00:26:54,943
事实上  我看到了
As a matter of fact,I have.

545
00:26:54,943 --> 00:26:56,945
你把他带到餐厅了吗?
Did you bring him to the mess hall?

546
00:26:56,945 --> 00:26:58,696
抱歉  长官  他溜走了
Uh,sorry,sir,but he gave us the slip.

547
00:26:58,696 --> 00:27:00,281
一定是知道我们要来了
Must have heard us coming.

548
00:27:00,281 --> 00:27:02,617
用铁棒击倒了我的一个手下
Cracked one of my people over the head with a metal rod

549
00:27:02,617 --> 00:27:05,453
在我能射击前
从一个服务舱口逃走了
and disappeared down a service hatch before I could get a shot off.

550
00:27:05,453 --> 00:27:08,581
不知道现在他在哪
There's no telling where he is now.

551
00:27:13,169 --> 00:27:15,630
Zelenka  回答我
Zelenka,respond.

552
00:27:16,381 --> 00:27:18,675
Zelenka  出来吧
Zelenka,come in.

553
00:27:18,675 --> 00:27:21,094
Radek  我们不会伤害你的
Radek,we are not trying to hurt you.

554
00:27:21,094 --> 00:27:22,470
我们需要你的帮助
We need your help.

555
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:24,764
这是没有意义的
Okay,this is pointless.

556
00:27:24,764 --> 00:27:26,724
我们都不知道他是否有对讲机
即使我们找到了他
Look,we don't even know if he still has a radio,and even if we find him,

557
00:27:26,724 --> 00:27:28,852
很有可能他也不记得
把控制水晶放在哪了
chances are,he's not going to remember what he did with the control crystal.

558
00:27:28,852 --> 00:27:30,603
面对现实吧  这样没戏的
Let's face it,we're screwed.

559
00:27:30,603 --> 00:27:33,064
会有办法的
There's gotta be some way out of this.

560
00:27:33,064 --> 00:27:34,941
用Jumper怎么样?  他们有DHD
What about the jumpers?They got DHDs.

561
00:27:34,941 --> 00:27:38,111
没有控制水晶
星际之门不能稳定的打开
Without the control crystal,the gate can't establish a stable wormhole.

562
00:27:38,111 --> 00:27:39,529
我们哪也去不了
We're not going anywhere.

563
00:27:39,529 --> 00:27:41,406
我忘记了一些事情
I'm missing something.

564
00:27:41,406 --> 00:27:43,450
我没法集中注意力
I can't concentrate.

565
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:45,076
大陆怎么样?
What about the mainland?

566
00:27:45,076 --> 00:27:46,369
Ronon说得对
Ronon is right.

567
00:27:46,369 --> 00:27:48,246
很多地方都有充足的Enchuri植物
The enchuri plant is abundant on many worlds.

568
00:27:48,246 --> 00:27:49,456
或许这里也有
It may be here as well.

569
00:27:49,456 --> 00:27:50,582
好的
All right.

570
00:27:50,582 --> 00:27:54,544
假定我们可以找到那东西
我们怎样分发给大家?
Assuming we can find the stuff,how are we going to distribute it?

571
00:27:55,128 --> 00:27:58,131
我会找到办法解决的
I'll figure something out.

572
00:27:58,423 --> 00:27:59,382
我会和Rodney在一起
I'll stay with rodney.

573
00:27:59,382 --> 00:28:00,425
你知道那东西的样子吗?
Do you know what to look for?

574
00:28:00,425 --> 00:28:03,219
那东西在Sateda上就像野草
Grows like a weed on sateda.

575
00:28:13,188 --> 00:28:15,982
没错
It's,uh...right there.

576
00:28:22,822 --> 00:28:24,324
你可以操控这个
You can fly this thing.

577
00:28:24,324 --> 00:28:26,743
技巧已经进入了你的血液里
It's in your blood.

578
00:28:26,743 --> 00:28:29,454
字面上说
(Jumper由用古人基因控制)
Literally.

579
00:28:46,054 --> 00:28:47,263
等下...
wait a second...

580
00:28:47,263 --> 00:28:49,766
我在做什么?
what am I doing?

581
00:28:50,475 --> 00:28:53,561
你说过最快分发的方法就是气化它
You said the quickest way to spread the cure was to aerosolize it

582
00:28:53,561 --> 00:28:55,897
通过通风传播
and distribute it through the ventilation system.

583
00:28:55,897 --> 00:29:01,736
你正在尝试改写
控制温湿度和气压的基本协议
You are currently attempting to override base protocol for temperature,humidity,and air pressure.

584
00:29:01,736 --> 00:29:03,404
好的  这个简单
Right...right,okay,it's easy.

585
00:29:03,404 --> 00:29:07,117
只是简单进入根目录的 接着--
Just a simple matter of accessing the root directory,and--

586
00:29:07,117 --> 00:29:08,368
不会吧!
Aw,come on!

587
00:29:08,368 --> 00:29:09,119
Rodney...
Rodney...

588
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:12,705
不  不 不 我应该在睡觉的时候
都能做这个的
no,no,no,no.I should be able to do this in my sleep.

589
00:29:12,705 --> 00:29:14,457
天啊...
Oh,god...

590
00:29:14,457 --> 00:29:15,458
我也开始失忆了  不是吗?
it's happening to me too,isn't it?

591
00:29:15,458 --> 00:29:16,960
你得保持镇静
You have to remain calm.

592
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,920
我的记忆本来就很不好
My memory was lousy to start with.

593
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,380
我很容易忘记人名  生日
I mean,people's names,birthdays.

594
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,924
我曾经连续5年忘记了母亲节
I once forgot mother's day five years in a row.

595
00:29:22,924 --> 00:29:25,635
一个圆的周长除以直径是多少?
What is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter?

596
00:29:25,635 --> 00:29:28,555
那是pi  是3.14159265等等
Well,that's pi.It's 3.14159265,et cetera,et cetera.

597
00:29:28,555 --> 00:29:29,973
这不算  太简单了
That doesn't count.That's easy.

598
00:29:29,973 --> 00:29:31,516
你是一名科学家  Rodney
You are a scientist,Rodney.

599
00:29:31,516 --> 00:29:32,725
那就是你关心的事情
That is what you care about.

600
00:29:32,725 --> 00:29:35,770
那是你记得最久的事情
That is what you will hang on to the longest.

601
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:37,063
对
Right.

602
00:29:37,063 --> 00:29:39,482
对  那么...
Right,so...

603
00:29:39,482 --> 00:29:41,443
等下
wait a minute.

604
00:29:41,443 --> 00:29:43,278
这不会使我变成一个很糟糕的人?
Doesn't that make me a really bad person?

605
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:47,031
那会使你变成拯救我们生命的人
It makes you the type of person who is going to save all our lives.

606
00:29:47,031 --> 00:29:49,075
好的
Oh,okay.

607
00:29:56,458 --> 00:29:59,252
这是什么地方?
What is this place?

608
00:29:59,252 --> 00:30:01,504
我不知道
I don't know.

609
00:30:01,504 --> 00:30:03,339
看起来他们走的很匆忙
Looks like they left in a hurry.

610
00:30:03,339 --> 00:30:04,340
她不在这  我们...
She's not here.Let'...

611
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,676
到这边来
Down here!This way!

612
00:30:06,676 --> 00:30:09,345
安静点!  快走
Quiet!Go,go.

613
00:30:17,479 --> 00:30:18,521
好的  大家分开找
All right,everybody,spread out.

614
00:30:18,521 --> 00:30:21,566
它们一定在这的某个地方
They got to be in here somewhere.

615
00:30:40,168 --> 00:30:42,504
长官!
Sir!

616
00:30:42,504 --> 00:30:44,130
找到它们了
Found 'em.

617
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:44,923
好的
Good.

618
00:30:44,923 --> 00:30:47,675
我们走  离开这里
Let's go.Let's move out,come on.

619
00:30:56,309 --> 00:30:59,687
我们能离开这里吗?
Can we get out of here,please?

620
00:31:01,481 --> 00:31:02,315
怎么了?
What is it?

621
00:31:02,315 --> 00:31:03,775
我有个主意
I have an idea.

622
00:31:03,775 --> 00:31:05,527
跟我来
Come on.

623
00:31:09,948 --> 00:31:12,450
我们走
Let's go.

624
00:31:14,786 --> 00:31:17,038
等下
Wait a minute.

625
00:31:17,038 --> 00:31:18,123
这是什么地方?
What is this place?

626
00:31:18,123 --> 00:31:20,333
大陆
The mainland.

627
00:31:20,333 --> 00:31:21,418
我们在这做什么?
What are we doing here?

628
00:31:21,418 --> 00:31:22,210
我已经告诉你了
I told you already.

629
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:25,213
我们得搞到那植物
We need to get that plant.

630
00:31:25,213 --> 00:31:27,674
有些东西很可疑
Something seems fishy.

631
00:31:31,761 --> 00:31:34,472
人千万不能老
Never gets old.

632
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:41,855
抱歉  伙计  你会拖我后腿的
Sorry,buddy.You're just going to slow me down.

633
00:31:54,617 --> 00:31:55,952
怎么样了  Rodney?
How's it coming,rodney?

634
00:31:55,952 --> 00:31:57,203
我要完成了
I'm just about finished.

635
00:31:57,203 --> 00:31:59,289
我想是的
I think.

636
00:31:59,748 --> 00:32:01,040
发生了什么?
What was that?

637
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,375
我去看看
I will go see.

638
00:32:02,375 --> 00:32:04,753
继续工作
Keep working.

639
00:32:24,647 --> 00:32:26,608
不要动!
Don't move!

640
00:32:26,608 --> 00:32:28,026
Lorne少校
Major Lorne.

641
00:32:28,026 --> 00:32:29,402
是我  Teyla
It's me,teyla.

642
00:32:29,402 --> 00:32:30,737
你不应该在这里的
You shouldn't be out here.

643
00:32:30,737 --> 00:32:32,322
少校  是我啊
Major,it's me.

644
00:32:32,322 --> 00:32:34,407
所有的人要被带到餐厅去
Everyone's been ordered back to the mess hall.

645
00:32:34,407 --> 00:32:35,408
但是Mckay博士和我...
But dr.Mckay and I--

646
00:32:35,408 --> 00:32:37,285
把手放在头上
put your hands on your head.

647
00:32:37,285 --> 00:32:39,245
慢慢地
Slowly.

648
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:54,969
Teyla?
Teyla?

649
00:33:03,561 --> 00:33:05,563
天啊...
Oh,god...

650
00:33:37,387 --> 00:33:40,849
好的  扶她起来
all right,let's get her up.

651
00:33:50,942 --> 00:33:52,986
快点...
Come on...

652
00:33:54,529 --> 00:33:55,905
好的
all right.

653
00:33:55,905 --> 00:33:57,949
我知道你现在很恐慌
Look,I know you're probably panicking right now,

654
00:33:57,949 --> 00:33:59,075
但是你没时间了
but there is no time for that.

655
00:33:59,075 --> 00:34:00,785
你需要集中注意力
You need to focus.

656
00:34:00,785 --> 00:34:05,415
我肯定你在想
是谁把你绑到了桌子上...
I'm sure you're wondering who tied you to the desk...

657
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,631
你醒了
you're awake.

658
00:34:13,631 --> 00:34:14,966
Lorne少校  你得放我出去...
Major lorne,you must set me free--

659
00:34:14,966 --> 00:34:19,262
在我得到答案前你哪都去不了
you're not going anywhere till I get some answers.

660
00:34:19,262 --> 00:34:21,931
我要知道你对我的人都做了些什么
I need to know what you've done to my people.

661
00:34:21,931 --> 00:34:23,057
我做了些什么?
What I've done?

662
00:34:23,057 --> 00:34:24,309
你认为是我干的?
You believe I'm behind this?

663
00:34:24,309 --> 00:34:25,852
是种药物吗?
Is it a drug?

664
00:34:25,852 --> 00:34:27,353
一种生化武器?
Some kind of bio-weapon?

665
00:34:27,353 --> 00:34:29,189
少校  他们生病了
Major,they're sick.

666
00:34:29,189 --> 00:34:30,315
你也一样
You as well.

667
00:34:30,315 --> 00:34:33,610
整个基地都受感染了
The entire base is infected with a disease.

668
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:36,112
除了你之外
Everyone except you.

669
00:34:36,112 --> 00:34:37,155
是的
Yes.

670
00:34:37,155 --> 00:34:38,656
我对这种病毒免疫
I'm immune to its effects.

671
00:34:38,656 --> 00:34:40,283
那不是太简单了吗?
Isn't that convenient?

672
00:34:40,283 --> 00:34:41,785
你吃了多少?
How many of those have you taken?

673
00:34:41,785 --> 00:34:43,912
你不用管这个
Why don't you just let me worry about that,okay?

674
00:34:43,912 --> 00:34:45,497
是这些药
It's the pills.

675
00:34:45,497 --> 00:34:47,874
它们使你成这样的
They're what's making you act like this.

676
00:34:47,874 --> 00:34:49,250
他们会搞乱你的思想
They're confusing you.

677
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:50,585
他们会使你激动
They're making you unstable.

678
00:34:50,585 --> 00:34:52,253
使我激动?
Making me unstable?

679
00:34:52,253 --> 00:34:54,756
我不是像我的人
传播疾病的人  好吗?
I'm not the one who unleashed a disease on my people,okay?

680
00:34:54,756 --> 00:34:55,840
不要敷衍了
Quit stalling.

681
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:59,052
我要知道你在走廊做些什么--
I want to know what you were doing in the hall--

682
00:35:01,763 --> 00:35:03,181
Rodney!

683
00:35:03,181 --> 00:35:04,057
Teyla?
Teyla?

684
00:35:04,057 --> 00:35:05,100

很高兴见到你
It's good to see you.

686
00:35:06,267 --> 00:35:08,895
Carter上校  Zelenka博士
很高兴见到你们
Colonel carter,dr.Zelenka,you as well.

687
00:35:08,895 --> 00:35:11,106
你们是怎么找到我的?
How did you find me?

688
00:35:11,106 --> 00:35:15,151
我们自己找不到  就跟踪他了
Uh,well,we were having trouble finding you by ourselves,so we followed him.

689
00:35:15,151 --> 00:35:17,362
你完成了工作吗?
Did you finish your work?

690
00:35:17,362 --> 00:35:20,198
什么意思?
W-what do you mean?

691
00:35:20,198 --> 00:35:23,785
你能关掉力场吗?
Can you disarm the force shield?

692
00:35:25,411 --> 00:35:28,456
我不知道
I-I don't know.

693
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,519
快点
Quickly.

694
00:36:07,579 --> 00:36:10,248
不要动
don't move.

695
00:36:10,248 --> 00:36:12,751
把枪丢下
Drop it.

696
00:36:13,001 --> 00:36:15,086
转过身来
Now back away.

697
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,260
现在...
Now...

698
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,387
告诉我...
tell me...

699
00:36:24,387 --> 00:36:26,182
你是谁?
who the hell are you?

700
00:36:27,196 --> 00:36:29,240
我知道你什么都记不得了
I know you don't remember everything.

701
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,950
你不知道发生了什么
You have no idea what's going on.

702
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:33,744
你很迷惑  或许还有点害怕
You're confused,maybe even a little scared.

703
00:36:33,744 --> 00:36:35,830
我知道我是会的
I know I would be.

704
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:38,958
但是你得相信我
But you have to trust me.

705
00:36:39,291 --> 00:36:40,751
我们是朋友
We're friends.

706
00:36:40,751 --> 00:36:42,003
我们一起经历过的事情...
The things we've been through together...

707
00:36:42,003 --> 00:36:45,548
我不管别人怎么说
那是疾病抹不掉的
I don't care what anyone says,no disease can wipe that away.

708
00:36:45,548 --> 00:36:47,133
不会完全抹去地
Not completely.

709
00:36:47,133 --> 00:36:51,178
内心深处你知道我说的是真话
Okay,deep down,you know I'm telling the truth.

710
00:36:52,179 --> 00:36:53,723
把枪给我
Now,give me the gun.

711
00:36:53,723 --> 00:36:56,225
想得美
Oh,nice try.

712
00:36:56,559 --> 00:36:58,644
我所记得的就是  你是绑住我的人
For all I know,you're the one who tied me up.

713
00:36:58,644 --> 00:37:00,104
好的
Fine.

714
00:37:00,104 --> 00:37:05,109
那开枪吧 然后你就要独自一人
在黑色森林的中还不知道自己是谁
Then shoot me,and you'll be all alone in the middle of a dark forest with no idea who you are,

715
00:37:05,109 --> 00:37:07,361
你要去哪  或者你要做什么
where you're going,or what you're going to do next.

716
00:37:07,361 --> 00:37:10,573
我怎么可能使情况变得更糟?
How could I possibly make it any worse?

717
00:37:10,573 --> 00:37:13,909
说得不错
That's a good point.

718
00:37:23,085 --> 00:37:24,045
这里
Here.

719
00:37:24,045 --> 00:37:25,212
坐下
Sit.

720
00:37:25,212 --> 00:37:26,672
你确定你不会做吗?
Are you sure you wouldn't rather do it?

721
00:37:26,672 --> 00:37:27,798
我不知道怎么做
I do not know how.

722
00:37:27,798 --> 00:37:28,633
我知道吗?
Oh,and I do?

723
00:37:28,633 --> 00:37:29,592
是的
Yes.

724
00:37:29,592 --> 00:37:31,385
你创作了超驰程序
You created the override program.

725
00:37:31,385 --> 00:37:32,928
你说快要完成了
You said you were almost finished.

726
00:37:32,928 --> 00:37:35,306
那应该很简单的
Oh,then it should be easy.

727
00:37:35,306 --> 00:37:36,515
Rodney  听我说
Rodney,listen to me.

728
00:37:36,515 --> 00:37:37,642
你必须做这个
You must do this.

729
00:37:37,642 --> 00:37:40,353
这次我们唯一的机会
It is our only chance.

730
00:37:42,563 --> 00:37:44,398
知识在你脑海里
The knowledge is inside you.

731
00:37:44,398 --> 00:37:47,443
你得找到它
You just have to find it.

732
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:06,253
程序完成
Program Complete

733
00:38:08,047 --> 00:38:09,215
他做到了
He did it.

734
00:38:09,215 --> 00:38:12,927
我在说要完成的时候  我猜我没有开玩笑
When I said I was almost finished,I-I guess I wasn't kidding.

735
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,804
现在怎么办?
Now what?

736
00:38:14,804 --> 00:38:20,393
我们得希望Sheppard中校
和Ronon完成他们的任务了
Well,now we just have to hope that colonel sheppard and ronon completed their side of the mission.

737
00:38:20,393 --> 00:38:22,561
好的
Right.

738
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:26,190
谁?
who?

739
00:38:27,984 --> 00:38:29,276
怎么了?
What is it?

740
00:38:29,276 --> 00:38:32,238
一艘飞船朝顶上的舱门飞来
A ship.Headed for the bay doors on the roof.

741
00:38:32,238 --> 00:38:33,781
他们有表示身份吗?
Have they identified themselves?

742
00:38:33,781 --> 00:38:35,533
没有  长官
No,sir.

743
00:38:35,533 --> 00:38:36,158
可能是援助
It could be help.

744
00:38:36,158 --> 00:38:38,077
也可能是某种攻击
It could also be some kind of an attack.

745
00:38:38,077 --> 00:38:41,247
联系其他的人
要他们到Jumper舱集合
Get in touch with the others.Tell them to meet me at the jumper bay.

746

And find major lorne!

747

快点  帮我拿东西

750

751
00:38:57,513 --> 00:38:58,848

把他们带到禁闭室去

758
00:39:16,032 --> 00:39:17,325
你在犯错误
You're making a mistake.

759
00:39:17,325 --> 00:39:20,161
生病的人需要这个
There are sick people who need that.

760
00:39:20,161 --> 00:39:21,704
你清楚你在做什么吗?

761
00:39:21,704 --> 00:39:23,622
这里发生了什么?
What the hell is going on here?

762
00:39:23,622 --> 00:39:26,625
长官  我抓到这些人正要潜入基地

Lorne  你得听我的

就看你防护衣的口袋
Just look in your vest pocket.

769

为了以防这样的事情发生
你给他照了一张相
You took a picture of him just in case it came to this.

775
00:39:53,819 --> 00:39:55,404
那么...
So...

776
00:39:55,404 --> 00:39:56,864
你应该做我说的事情

00:40:33,776 --> 00:40:36,445
Teyla通过通风分发了那个植物

让你昏过去了

786
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:40,032
我睡了多久了?
How long have I been asleep?

787
00:40:40,032 --> 00:40:41,784
大约一天
About a day.

00:40:52,461 --> 00:40:54,672
有些事挺模糊的
things are a little fuzzy.

795
00:40:54,672 --> 00:40:57,174
如果明年我忘记了你的生日...

我会原谅你的

很高兴他还留着我给他的照片

不错的想法
That was good thinking,by the way.

802
00:41:11,731 --> 00:41:14,650
如果治愈再推迟下的话

803
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:16,861
更多的人会死去
