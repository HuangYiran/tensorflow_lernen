1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,008
别招惹你妹妹
Step away from your sister.

2
00:00:03,877 --> 00:00:05,364
Karen 上楼换衣服去
Karen, go up and get changed.

3
00:00:05,364 --> 00:00:08,283
Ben 你能不能别玩那个了
Ben, will you stop playing with that!

4
00:00:08,283 --> 00:00:12,963
听着 最后一次 你决不能也不要再打人了
Listen, for the last time - you should never, ever, hit a person.

5
00:00:12,963 --> 00:00:16,415
- 如果他们用铁锹袭击我怎么办 - 什么
- What if they're attacking you with a shovel? - What?

6
00:00:16,415 --> 00:00:18,735
如果有人用铁锹袭击你的话
If someone's attacking you with a shovel,

7
00:00:18,735 --> 00:00:20,295
你绝对应该回击他
you must be able to hit them.

8
00:00:20,295 --> 00:00:23,734
好吧 显然 没错 我是说 那是防卫
Well, obviously, yeah. I mean, that would be self-defence,

9
00:00:23,734 --> 00:00:25,654
所以很显然 在某种
so obviously, in that sort of

10
00:00:25,654 --> 00:00:29,775
涉及到铁锹的情况下 你能打别人 但
shovel-related circumstance, you can hit someone but.

11
00:00:29,775 --> 00:00:31,855
哈 可你说了 “决不 再不要”
Ah, but you said "Never, ever"!

12
00:00:31,855 --> 00:00:33,894
Ben 你理解的很对
Ben, you know perfectly well.

13
00:00:33,894 --> 00:00:37,854
大家赶紧的 可别在这个婚礼上也迟到了
Come on people! Let's not be late for another wedding! Ah.

14
00:00:37,854 --> 00:00:41,655
今日的神秘物件是
And today's mystery object is.

15
00:00:41,655 --> 00:00:45,855
电视机后的泥铲 Karen 你准备好了嘛？
a trowel behind the telly. Karen, are you ready?

16
00:00:45,855 --> 00:00:49,654
听着 Ben 你决不能先对别人动手
Look, Ben. You must never hit someone first.

17
00:00:49,654 --> 00:00:51,895
如果你是一个拳击手呢
What if you're a boxer?

18
00:00:51,895 --> 00:00:54,362
- 如果你是个拳击手 你就能揍别人了 - 听着
- If you're a boxer, you should be able to hit someone. - Listen!

19
00:00:54,362 --> 00:00:56,442
因为拳击手的工作就是揍人
..Because a boxer's job is to punch people.

20
00:00:56,442 --> 00:00:58,282
- 但我们没有在讨论 - Karen
- But we're not talking about... - Karen!

21
00:00:58,282 --> 00:00:59,649
如果有人走向你
What if somebody's walking

22
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:01,963
而且你知道他们是杀手
towards you and you know they're a murderer.

23
00:01:01,963 --> 00:01:04,122
- Ben - 他们还拿着铁锹
- Ben... - And they have a shovel.

24
00:01:04,122 --> 00:01:06,923
Ben 这不关拿着铁锹的杀手什么事
Ben, this isn't about murderers with shovels...

25
00:01:06,923 --> 00:01:10,123
- Jake 能别发短信了吗 - 还有啊 为啥一定要我穿这种衣服
- Jake, can you stop texting? - Why have I got to to wear this stuff anyway?

26
00:01:10,123 --> 00:01:12,082
- 又难看又刺痒 - 大家赶紧的
- It's horrible and itchy and... - Come on, everyone! 

27
00:01:12,082 --> 00:01:13,575
我们要去参加个婚礼
We're going to a wedding,

28
00:01:13,576 --> 00:01:16,683
每个人都不得不这样装模作样的
and everyone has to be as uncomfortable as humanly possible.

29
00:01:16,683 --> 00:01:18,750
这是规定 现在去吧 快点 把你的鞋子穿上
It's the law. Now go, come on, get your shoes on.

30
00:01:18,751 --> 00:01:19,569
Karen 你需要帮忙吗
Karen, do you need some help?.

31
00:01:19,569 --> 00:01:24,312
不不 我们不是说好了 要到Julie家里之后
No, no... I thought we'd agreed you were going to change into your dress

32
00:01:24,312 --> 00:01:26,529
你才换上你的裙子 和另一个伴娘一样
when we got to Julie's house, like the other bridesmaid.

33
00:01:26,529 --> 00:01:30,480
- 但我想试穿一下我的裙子 - 可是宝贝 那样就
- But I want to travel in my dress. - But darling, it'll get...

34
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,978
你不该在我大喜的日子里让我不高兴
You're not supposed to upset me on my big day.

35
00:01:32,978 --> 00:01:35,222
严格说起来 Karen
Well, strictly-speaking, Karen,

36
00:01:35,222 --> 00:01:36,288
今天是Julie表姐大喜的日子 不是吗
it's cousin Julie's big day, isn't it?

37
00:01:37,812 --> 00:01:40,048
我真希望大家别再说这话了
I wish everybody would stop saying that.

38
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:42,732
去换回你原先穿的那套吧
Go and change into what you were wearing before.

39
00:01:42,732 --> 00:01:48,653
谁第一个走过通道呢 是我还是另一个伴娘
Who comes down the aisle first, me or the other bridesmaid?

40
00:01:48,653 --> 00:01:51,813
这由Julie表姐决定 所以我们就只能听候她安排了
That's up to Cousin Julie, so we'll wait and see what she wants wouldn't we?

41
00:01:51,813 --> 00:01:56,372
谁第一个走过通道呢 Julie表姐还是我呢
Who comes down the aisle first, Cousin Julie or me?

42
00:01:56,372 --> 00:01:58,173
当然是Julie表姐了
That would be Cousin Julie

43
00:01:58,173 --> 00:02:01,133
因为她才是新娘啊
on account of the fact that she's the bride.

44
00:02:01,133 --> 00:02:03,733
现在去换衣服吧 Karen
Now go and get changed, Karen.

45
00:02:04,973 --> 00:02:06,213
我来接
I'll get that!

46
00:02:06,213 --> 00:02:10,893
- 我们得走了 快点儿 - 嗨 老爸 你好吗
- We've got to shift, come on! - Hi, Dad. How are you?

47
00:02:10,893 --> 00:02:13,652
老爸 Angela姨妈是不是要参加婚礼啊
Dad, is Auntie Angela coming to the wedding?

48
00:02:13,652 --> 00:02:16,773
这个
Well...

49
00:02:16,773 --> 00:02:18,550
她没回复邀请
She hasn't replied to the invitation,

50
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,412
而且美国离得远
and America's a long way away,

51
00:02:20,412 --> 00:02:23,772
而Angela姨妈总是让人难以琢磨 所以
so you never really know with Auntie Angela, so...

52
00:02:23,772 --> 00:02:25,973
老天 我希望她和老妈别再干架了
God, I hope Mum and her don't have another fight.

53
00:02:25,973 --> 00:02:29,813
其实那也不能算是真正的干架 对吧
Well, it wasn't really a fight exactly, was it?

54
00:02:29,813 --> 00:02:32,373
至少没用到铁锹
No shovels involved.

55
00:02:32,373 --> 00:02:34,188
对 但她们对吼
No, but there was shouting,

56
00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:37,013
尖叫 还对骂 骂的很厉害
screaming and swearing. A lot of swearing.

57
00:02:37,013 --> 00:02:40,853
你看 所有的姐妹之间总有些小分歧
Look, all sisters have these little disagreements,

58
00:02:40,853 --> 00:02:42,932
而且我想如果她来的话
and I'm sure that if she does come,

59
00:02:42,933 --> 00:02:45,012
她们会非常和谐的化解的
they'll be very civilized about it.

60
00:02:46,613 --> 00:02:48,972
不管怎样 她多半是来不了了
Anyway she probably won't come.

61
00:02:50,973 --> 00:02:52,253
妈的 都这个点了
Bollocks, the present!

62
00:02:52,253 --> 00:02:53,612
- 老天 - 你还好吧
- God! - You OK?

63
00:02:53,612 --> 00:02:56,573
不好 是我爸 他彻底忘记了婚礼了
No, that was Dad. He's forgotten all about the wedding,

64
00:02:56,573 --> 00:02:58,413
现在还只穿着睡衣呢
and he's still in his pyjamas.

65
00:02:58,413 --> 00:03:00,293
我脑袋蹦蹦的跳着痛
I've got a thumping headache

66
00:03:00,293 --> 00:03:02,973
而Karen对她的裙子小题大做的
and Karen's faffing about with her dress!

67
00:03:04,627 --> 00:03:05,387
Karen 你这是干嘛去
Karen, where are you off to?

68
00:03:05,387 --> 00:03:08,217
- 我要上厕所 - 好吧 需要帮你脱掉裙子什么的吗
- I need a wee. - OK. Do you need any help with your dress and stuff?

69
00:03:08,707 --> 00:03:11,887
- 我都六岁了 - 行 但别插上那个门栓 因为不太灵活了
- I'm six. - OK, but don't slide the bolt across, cos it's stiff.

70
00:03:11,887 --> 00:03:12,451
什么
What?

71
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,839
我说 你要小心别插上
I said, can you make sure you don't slide the...

72
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:22,240
门栓
..Bolt across.

73
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:28,240
好吧 呃 Karen 亲爱的 听着 你能否 呃
OK, erm..Karen, darling. Listen, can you, erm...

74
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,720
能帮我个忙吗
Can you do me a favour?

75
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,920
你能把门栓再拨回去吗
Can you just put the bolt back across again?

76
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,720
你明白我的意思 我知道你行的
You know, just so I know you can.

77
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,000
我办不到 卡住了
I can't. It's too stiff.

78
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,639
你应该警告我别插门栓啊
You should have warned me not to put the bolt across!

79
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:46,040
甜心 其实我真心是说了的啊 只是
I think it was mentioned actually, sweetheart. But just erm...

80
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,280
总之别担心 你会没事的
There's nothing to worry about, you'll be fine.

81
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:52,999
那 你既然可以把它拉到一边 那你就
Well, you slid it one way, you should...

82
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:55,319
你就能把它拉回另一边
You should be able to slide it the other.

83
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:58,119
赶紧的各位 我们出发了
Come on everyone, let's go!

84
00:03:58,119 --> 00:04:00,606
Ben 别那么做 我们得多给自己
Ben, don't do that. We need to allow ourselves

85
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:03,960
留点儿时间 因为你老爸他信不过导航仪
plenty of time because Dad doesn't trust the sat nav any more.

86
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:11,120
就因为那次跑到军队靶场去了 这该死的蓝药瓶
Not since that visit to the army firing range. Bloody (junk)blue bottles!

87
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:17,680
谢谢
Cheers.

88
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:21,719
只要用力的推就好
Just give it a big push.

89
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:24,239
她出不来了 她永久的被困在那里了
She won't get out, she'll be stuck forever.

90
00:04:24,239 --> 00:04:26,000
Ben 那样说根本于事无补
Ben, that is not helpful thing to say.

91
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,200
- Karen - 你应该提醒她别插门栓的
- Karen... - You should have told her not to put the bolt across.

92
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,160
可笑的是 我正是
Funnily enough, that was exactly...

93
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,679
你得把门打破才行
You'll have to break the door down.

94
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,199
你介意吗 我会处理这事的
Do you mind? I'm dealing with this.

95
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:37,759
在《警察故事》里 他们都是用那种好大好大的专用破门锤
On The Bill, they have this really really big special door-basher,

96
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,839
就像个金属大棒
that's like a big metal pole.

97
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:44,879
不幸的是我们没有那种金属大棒
Unfortunately we don't have a big special door-basher

98
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:46,960
专用破门锤 所以
with a long metal pole so...

99
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,080
万一她要是渴了 喝了厕所的水怎么办
What if she gets thirsty and drinks the toilet water?

100
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,719
那其实没什么的 Karen
Well, that'll be fine. Karen!

101
00:04:51,719 --> 00:04:55,719
- 这是怎么了 - 我被困在厕所了
- What is going on? - I'm stuck in the toilet.

102
00:04:55,719 --> 00:04:58,560
你不该让她插门栓的
You shouldn't have let her put the bolt across.

103
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,680
好吧 要是再有人这么说的话
Right, the next person who says that...

104
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,800
好吧 让我们先别慌
OK, let's try not to panic.

105
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,720
没有人慌啊
No-one is panicking.

106
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,479
- Karen慌啊 - 谢谢你 Jake 我已经意识到了
- Karen's panicking. - Thank you, Jake. Yes, I am aware of that.

107
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,763
如果她能把门栓合上
If she slid the bolt one way,

108
00:05:09,764 --> 00:05:11,359
她就应该能再拉开的啊
she should be able to slide it back.

109
00:05:11,359 --> 00:05:14,000
就是说啊 所以我刚才就
Yes I know, and that is why I have been...

110
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,699
好吧 让我们先冷静下
OK, let's try to stay calm.

111
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,279
- 我很冷静 - 这铁定会让我们误点的
- I am calm. - This is going to make us late.

112
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:20,479
我们不能迟到啊 这可是我大喜的日子
We can't be late! It's my big day!

113
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,919
没事儿的 Karen 淡定点儿
It's all right Karen. Stay calm.

114
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:25,520
我们可以把几只海狸从窗户扔进去 让它们咬门
We could put beavers through the window and they'd eat the door.

115
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,479
听着 我们能停止讨论用海狸什么的蠢建议吗
Look! Can we please stop with the stupid suggestions about beavers?

116
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,599
- 没必要惊慌的 - 救命啊 - 我没慌啊
- There's no point in panicking. - Help! - I am not panicking.

117
00:05:34,599 --> 00:05:36,160
我们不会迟到的
We're not going to be late.

118
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,785
我会搞定这事的 
I will deal with it. And I

119
00:05:37,786 --> 00:05:40,600
而且我会冷静的 妥善的处理此事
will deal with it in a calm and measured way.

120
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,840
换那个门要花多少钱呢
How much will it cost to replace that door?

121
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,639
你瞧 我让咱们及时赶到了 不是吗
Look, I got us here on time, didn't I?

122
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:52,720
有时严峻的形势下需要采取严厉的措施
Sometimes drastic situations require drastic measures.

123
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,600
- 那你的肩膀还好吗 - 还好
- So, how's your shoulder? - Fine.

124
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,399
- 你的脚呢 - 还行
- And your foot? - Yes.

125
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:04,480
- 那你的 - 打住 我们能先别 行吗 - 你还好吧 外公
- And your... - Look, can we just... OK? - You all right, Granddad?

126
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,399
什么 哦 没事没事 就是在欣赏新娘
What? Oh, yeah, yeah. Just admiring the bride.

127
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:10,919
Judy看起来真是赏心悦目 不是吗
Judy looks smashing doesn't she, eh?

128
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,680
是Julie啊 外公
It's Julie, Granddad.

129
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,480
是吗 哦哦 是吧
What... Oh. Oh, yeah.

130
00:06:20,999 --> 00:06:22,879
女孩们 我看起来怎么样
So, girls, how do I look?

131
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:26,960
- 你看起来很漂亮 - 哈 谢谢你 Karen
- You look beautiful. - Ah, thank you, Karen.

132
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,320
我看起来漂亮吗
Do I look beautiful?

133
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,599
凑合吧
You look OK.

134
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:32,799
你看起来美极了 Mary
You look gorgeous, Mary.

135
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:35,160
为什么结婚礼服是白色的呢
Why are wedding dresses white?

136
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,320
因为妈妈说白色不好 它很容易脏的
Because Mummy says it's a bad colour because it shows the dirt.

137
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,119
那倒是事实 我是说白色的确不耐脏 对吧
That's true, I mean it's not very practical, is it?

138
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:46,599
还有 为什么婚纱那么搞笑呢
And also, why are wedding dresses funny?

139
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:51,760
- 搞笑吗 - 是啊 因为当我在车上问爸妈
- Funny? - Yes, because when I asked my Mummy and Daddy in the car

140
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,640
新娘是否要穿婚纱的时候 他们回答 “是的”
would the bride be wearing white, they said, "Yes",

141
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,320
然后就开始咯咯的傻笑
and started giggling.

142
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,720
是吗
Did they?

143
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,039
他们还想掩饰来着 不过我看到妈妈的肩膀
And they tried to hide it but I could see Mummy's shoulders

144
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,600
就这样上下抖啊抖的
moving up and down like this.

145
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,279
这样啊 好啊
Right. Great...

146
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:16,159
好了 Ben 再提醒你一次 那是碎石 这是五彩纸屑
Right, Ben, a little reminder. Gravel. Confetti.

147
00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:17,347
你上次在Sandra阿姨的婚礼上
You seemed to get confused

148
00:07:17,348 --> 00:07:19,360
把这两种给弄混了 对吧
at your Auntie Sandra's wedding, didn't you?

149
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,632
当牧师问
When the priest says,

150
00:07:20,633 --> 00:07:23,359
“是否有人反对这两人的结合”时
"Does anyone know any reason why these people

151
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:27,119
不准喊出什么奇怪的答案 可以吗
"Can't get married", no shouting out funny answers, all right?

152
00:07:27,119 --> 00:07:30,440
- 你是说 比如 “她是个男人”之类的吗 - 是的
- You mean like "She's a man"? - Yes!

153
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,240
正是如此
Exactly like that.

154
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,495
你应该庆幸你Sandra阿姨的
You're lucky your Auntie

155
00:07:33,496 --> 00:07:35,640
幽默感还是蛮好的
Sandra's got such a good sense of humour.

156
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:42,040
- 那是谁啊 - 是Sam 我们曾约会过几次
- Who's that? - That's Sam. We used to go out together.

157
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,120
你有多少个男朋友会来观礼呢
How many of your boyfriends are here?

158
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,559
不是很多 就几个 几个而已
Not many. A few, a few.

159
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:50,759
那么 那个秃头的呢
What about... What about the bald one?

160
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:55,879
- 哦 Colin啊 - 我妈喜欢他 - 是吗 Colin不在 他不会来的
- Oh, Colin. - My mum liked him. - Did she? No Colin, Colin's not here.

161
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:59,639
那么那个和女皇是朋友的呢
What about that one that was friends with the Queen?

162
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:01,279
你说什么
Sorry?

163
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,920
和女皇是朋友 他和女皇是
Friends with the Queen He's friends with...

164
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,640
朋友 你知道的啊 他和女皇是好朋友啊
of the Queen, you know, he's friends with the Queen.

165
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,119
他是女皇的客人啊
He's a guest of her majesty.

166
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:16,240
是啊 是啊 不 他 他也不会来
Right. Right. No, he's... He's not here.

167
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,680
他住在白金汉宫吗
Is he at Buckingham Palace?

168
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,439
不 他不住在白金汉宫
No, he's not at Buckingham Palace.
170.5

169
00:08:24,887 --> 00:08:27,439
我妈妈不喜欢他
My mummy didn't like him

170
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,847
看起来 你爸妈会讨论
So, your mummy and daddy were

171
00:08:29,848 --> 00:08:32,280
我选男友的品味了 是吗
discussing my taste in boyfriends, were they?

172
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:36,080
- 是的 - 好吧
- Yes. - Right.

173
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,239
谁是Ulrika呢
Who's Ulrika?

174
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,599
我也不知道我遇到
I don't know what I would

175
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,480
北极熊袭击时会怎么做呢 Ben 大概会装死吧
do if I was attacked by a polar bear, Ben. Playing death probably.

176
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,920
现在赶紧坐下吧 就坐你妈旁边
Now, come on, sit there. Space by your Mother.

177
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,608
- 不行 不可以 - 行 当然可以
- No, there isn't. - Yes, there is.

178
00:08:50,609 --> 00:08:52,679
- 这里不行 瞧啊 - 那不是空位嘛
- No there isn't, look. - There's a space.

179
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:55,355
你旁边那里不是明显有个空位嘛
There's quite obviously a space next to you.

180
00:08:55,356 --> 00:08:57,119
- 为什么要挨着我 为什么要挨着我啊 - 去吧 Ben 挨着Jake坐 
- Why next to me? Why next to me? - Come on, Ben, by Jake. 

181
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:03,640
这场景让我回想起了自己结婚那天时的情景
This is brings back so many memories of my wedding day.

182
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,680
拥挤的教堂 每个人都盛装出席
A crowded church, everyone in their finery.

183
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,040
还有Jane 噢 Jane 她是那么的漂亮
And Jane. Oh, Jane. So beautiful.

184
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,039
她美的令人惊叹
Breathtaking she was.

185
00:09:15,599 --> 00:09:16,839
爸
Dad...

186
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:19,439
妈妈的名字是Joan啊
Mum's name was Joan.

187
00:09:19,439 --> 00:09:21,708
我知道 但她有个
I know, but she had this

188
00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:25,679
很靓的朋友叫做Jane 是个绝色尤物
gorgeous friend called Jane. Real stunner.

189
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,479
我真是不敢相信你 你刚刚
I can't believe that you... that you just...

190
00:09:30,479 --> 00:09:34,960
并不能因为你要结婚了 就不再欣赏美女了吧
Just because you're getting married doesn't mean you got stopping admiring beautiful women.

191
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,640
可是就这样 在这圣坛前吗
But that's just... At the altar?

192
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,800
得了吧 男人都是这样的
Oh, come on. It's just what men are like...

193
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,999
那么 你要发誓爱他到永远
So, you promise to love him forever and ever,

194
00:09:43,999 --> 00:09:47,120
但你怎么知道这是真的呢
but how do you know that's true?

195
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,679
我就是知道 我爱Derek 简单明了
I just know. I love Derek. That's all there is.

196
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:53,097
那你就不爱其他你那些
So you didn't love any of

197
00:09:53,098 --> 00:09:55,480
男朋友了吗 比如那个秃头的
those other boyfriends, like the bald one,

198
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,839
还有那个是女皇的朋友的
and the one that was friends with the Queen?

199
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:03,320
我想我曾经也是爱过他们的
Well. I suppose at the time, you think you love them...

200
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:08,679
- 但是最后你发现那几次你都错了 - 是的
- Then it turns out that you were wrong all those times. - Yes.

201
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:10,919
但是这次你确定了
But you're right this time.

202
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:12,999
是的
Yes.

203
00:10:12,999 --> 00:10:14,759
真是大好结局啊
And that's happy and good.

204
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:16,600
是大好结局
That is happy and good.

205
00:10:20,199 --> 00:10:24,920
为什么耶稣的脸上是悲伤的表情
Why has Jesus got that sad expression on his face?

206
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,160
这个嘛 他被
Well, he's being...

207
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:32,240
钉在十字架上 那令他很痛苦
crucified and it's making him feel sad.

208
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,399
他手都被钉子钉住了 他一定会 “啊啊”大叫
He's got nails in his hands. He should be going, "Aargh".

209
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:38,480
- Ben 安静 - 他一定会的
- Ben, sssh! - Well, he should.

210
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,975
- 多愁善感的老耶稣 - Ben 别那样
- Soppy old Jesus. - Ben! Please!

211
00:10:40,976 --> 00:10:44,159
- 这一点都不现实 - 你能不能就
- It's not realistic. - Would you just...

212
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,280
嗨 快看 那是Angela 她到底还是来了 真是太好了
Hey look, it's Angela! She's made it, isn't that brilliant?

213
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,599
哦 是啊 还真是好呢
Oh, yeah. That's... That's brilliant.

214
00:10:53,599 --> 00:10:58,319
嗨 嗨 Pete 嗨 老爸 Sue
Hi! Hi, Pete! Hiya, Dad, Sue.

215
00:10:58,319 --> 00:11:01,640
嗨 Jake. 嗨 Ben
Hi, Jake. Hi, Ben.

216
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,319
- 我好难过啊 - Ben
- I'm so sad. - Ben!

217
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:08,879
- 他没什么变化呢 对吧 - 你能来真是太好了
- He hasn't changed, does he? - It's fantastic you could make it.

218
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:11,520
恐怕只是个短暂停留
It's just a whistle-stop tour, I'm afraid.

219
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,279
我的老板离不开我啊
My boss can't spare me for long.

220
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,440
当然离不开 是啊
Course not, no.

221
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,880
到这儿来
Come here.

222
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,040
- 你认识Derek多久了 - 十个月
- How long have you known Derek? - Ten months.

223
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,919
- 那可不怎么长啊 - 哦 看哪 好可爱的楼梯
- That's not a very long time. - Oh, look! What a lovely staircase.

224
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,920
我爸妈不在一起生活了
My mummy and daddy don't live together any more.

225
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,199
妈妈说在他们结婚的那天
Mummy said that on their wedding day,

226
00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:35,639
她曾以为他是这个星球上最棒的男人
she thought he was the most wonderful man on the planet.

227
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:38,999
现在她就一直哭
Now she just cries all the time.

228
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:43,000
这就开始了 甜心 准备好了吗
Here we go, sweetheart. All set?

229
00:11:53,599 --> 00:11:56,679
Julie眼里含着泪呢
Julie's got tears in her eyes.

230
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:58,520
那是啊 激动人心的一天
Well. It's an emotional day.

231
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,160
那是谁
Who's that?

232
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,600
- 不知道 - 我们在这桌
- No idea. - This is our table.

233
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,280
他们把Ben和Karen分到儿童桌了
They've put Ben and Karen on a children's table.

234
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,839
- 好极了 - 真的吗
- Result! - Is it?

235
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:32,080
Ben坐在儿童桌呢
Ben is on a children's table.

236
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,360
和其他小孩一起
With other children.

237
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,359
你能不能别当直升机家长啊
You can't be a helicopter parent.

238
00:12:36,359 --> 00:12:38,332
你总是盘旋在他身边
You just hover around him all the time.

239
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,559
你都不给他什么空间 他会没事的
You don't give him any space. He'll be fine!

240
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:43,400
就算有的话 也只是个垂直起降飞机的家长
More of a sort of jump-jet parent, if anything.

241
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:47,839
我喜欢快速切入去解决问题
I like to just get in there quickly and sort stuff out.

242
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,199
老天 是你啊 Howard
My God, it's you, Howard!

243
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:51,599
你好啊 Vicar
Oh, hello Vicar!

244
00:12:51,599 --> 00:12:55,480
又来了 这个找存在感的
Here it comes, the attention-seeking missile.

245
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,279
- 听着 Sue 今 - 今天是Julie大喜的日子 我知道
- Look, Sue. This... - This is Julie's big day, yes I know.

246
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,480
我想要说的是
All I was going to say is...

247
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,640
我必须要再三克制 是的 我懂
That I must stay in control. Yes, I know that.

248
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,080
而且你也不用担心
And you needn't worry,

249
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,439
因为我向自己保证了
because I have made a promise to myself,

250
00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:14,519
不管Angela怎么激怒我
and no matter how provoking Angela gets,

251
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:18,359
我都会无视并忍下来的 好吗
I am simply going to choose to rise above it. OK?

252
00:13:19,439 --> 00:13:22,319
- 好吧 - 好 好 解决了
- OK. - OK. OK, sorted.

253
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,160
那个 她貌似控制得不错 不是吗
Well, she, eh...seems to be on top of it, doesn't she?

254
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,400
是啊
Yeah.

255
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,400
- 她们要走个对面了 - 我去解决
- They're walking towards each other. - I'm on it.

256
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,479
- 嗨 Angela姨妈 你好 - 嗨 Jakey
- Hi, Auntie Angela, hello. - Hi, Jakey.

257
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:45,120
漂亮的桌牌
Nice table display.

我喜欢那种漂亮的老式桌牌 你呢
I like a good old table display, don't you?

260
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,920
如果你要坐在儿童桌的话
If you're going to sit on the children's table,

261
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,204
你必须做到不打架 不喝
you got to do no fighting, no drinking

262
00:13:56,205 --> 00:13:58,560
成人饮料 不骂人 你明白吗
grown-up drinks and no swearing. Do you understand?

263
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,920
因为我们决定信任你
Cos we're gonna trust you.

264
00:14:00,999 --> 00:14:02,840
- 信任我吗 - 是的
- Trust me? - Yeah.

265
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,679
你是要信任我吗
You're going to trust me?

266
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:08,279
是的 还有你不能和这个小女孩掰腕子
Yes. Only, you mustn't arm-wrestle this little girl

267
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:10,919
- 因为她看起来才三岁 - 是四岁
- cos she only looks about three. - Four.

268
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:12,599
她才四岁
She's four.

269
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,559
- 你还好吧 Pete - 呃
- You all right, Pete? - Erm...

270
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:43,519
- 是啊 Frank 是的 - 新娘倒是躲起来了
- Yeah, Frank, yeah. - The bride's certainly putting it away.

271
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,279
搞不好是大赛神经紧张的后遗症呢 Frank
Probably a case of big-match nerves, Frank.

272
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,039
我能再问你一个关于圣经的问题吗
Can I ask you another question about the Bible?

273
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:52,079
呃 当然 你问吧 Ben
Erm. Well, of course you can, Ben.

274
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:56,600
希律王下令要杀了幼儿耶稣 是吧
King Herod sent out an order to kill the baby Jesus, right?

275
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,720
是的 没错
Right, yes, he did. Yep.

276
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,280
那为什么幼儿耶稣没反击干掉他呢
Well, why didn't Baby Jesus zap him?

277
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:08,359
是啊 我 我认为在理论上他的确能
Well, yes, I... I suppose in theory he could have...

278
00:15:08,359 --> 00:15:09,520
干掉他 他…
zapped him, he...

279
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:16,639
因为希律王对于耶稣来说是微不足道的
Because Herod, was a tiny little speck of nothing to Jesus,

280
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:21,120
耶稣用一只河马就能压扁了他 或者…
cos Jesus could have squashed him with a hippopotamus or...

281
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,320
但是耶稣总是逆来顺受的
But Jesus was meek and mild.

282
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,720
是啊 说的没错 Karen
Well, yes, that's true, Karen.

283
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:30,759
况且 他还知道当希律王下地狱后
And besides, he knew that when King Herod got to Hell,

284
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:35,559
上帝会让他在火上炙烤 直到他的眼球都爆掉
that God would roast him until his eyeballs exploded.

285
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:38,066
还有啊 为什么上帝只给我们
And why has God only given

286
00:15:38,067 --> 00:15:42,599
留下十五万亿年好生存
us fifteen thousand billion years left to live,

287
00:15:42,599 --> 00:15:47,159
- 就熄灭了太阳呢 - 呃…
- before the sun dies? - Erm...

288
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,159
- Sue 嗨 - 嗨
- Sue, hi! - Oh, hi!

289
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,720
最近还好吧
So, how's things?

290
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,439
还不错 你最近怎么样啊
Ooh, things are good. How're things with you?

291
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:59,120
挺好
Good, yeah.

292
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,640
- 你还住在Keely大街吗 - 是 是啊 我们还在那儿
- Are you still in Keely Road? - Yeah, yeah, we are.

293
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,959
你还 还住在…
Are you... Are you still in..?

294
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,159
老地方 是啊
The same place, yeah.

295
00:16:10,599 --> 00:16:12,920
- 你带着孩子们过来的吗 - 是啊
- Have you got your kids with you? - Yeah.

296
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:17,760
- 什么 三个都来了吗 - 是啊 - Karen应该六岁了吧
- What, all three? - Yes. - Karen must be, what six?

297
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:24,760
六岁了 没错 你们呢 你们家的孩子呢
Six, yes. Yes, how about you? Have you got your...offspring?

298
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,000
对啊 他也来了 Pete和你一起过来的吗
Oh, yeah, he's around somewhere. Have you got Pete with you?

299
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,320
- 我们想见见他 - 嗯 这个就是Pete - 嗨
- We'd love to meet him. - Oh, um... This is Pete. - Hi.

300
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,279
Pete 这位是…
Pete this is...

301
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,799
真不错 不是吗
Lovely, isn't it, this?

302
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:40,800
他们安排的这个…
What they've done with this...

303
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,160
这位是我的父亲 这位是…
And this is my dad and this is...

304
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,999
这是你的座位 老爸 这里
where you're sitting Dad, here.

305
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:48,080
你们坐在哪里呢
Where are you sitting?

306
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,200
呃 就在这个桌子 和你们一起
Erm, on this table, with you.

307
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:55,079
太好了 真是太好了 因为这种状况下你总会担心
Great! That's great, because you're always worried

308
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:58,280
被安排和谁在坐在了一起
about who's gonna be on the table with you at things like this.

309
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,719
我们可以放心了 因为我们和
We're gonna be OK because we've got...

310
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:03,320
Paula和Steve坐在一起
Paula and steve!

311
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,959
欢迎你们 Paula和Steve Steve和Paula
Welcome, Paula and Steve! Steve and Paula...

312
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:07,399
那你们怎么认识Sue的呢
So where do you know Sue from?

313
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,080
你想告诉他吗 还是我来呢
Do you want to tell him or shall I?

314
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,320
还是你来说吧 Paula
You tell him, Paula.

315
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,249
Angela怎么不和我们在一桌呢
Is Angela not on our table then?

316
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,239
我们能调换一下吗
Can't we do something about that?

317
00:17:15,239 --> 00:17:18,279
我觉得这样打乱座位安排不太合理呢 Frank
It wouldn't be fair to disrupt the seating plan, Frank.

318
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:21,159
人家可是下了大工夫的啊
A lot of work's gone into that.

319
00:17:21,159 --> 00:17:26,600
当耶稣长大了一些后
When Jesus was a bit older,

320
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,200
他仍然被罗马人通缉着
and he was still being searched by the Romans,

321
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,319
- 为什么他不变形 - 变形吗
- why couldn't he shape shift... - Shape shift?

322
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:37,640
变成罗马人 然后当其他罗马人都睡着后
..Into a Roman, and then when all the other Romans were asleep,

323
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,080
他就能杀了他们 这样他们也就不会再通缉他了
he could kill them so they would stop searching for him.

324
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,920
我很怀疑他会这么做呢
Yes, well I doubt he would do that.

325
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,560
他并不是恐龙战队之类的人物
He wasn't a Power Ranger or anything like that.

326
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,279
我可以再问你个问题吗
Can I ask you another one?

327
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:48,999
这是最后一个了吗
Is this the last question?

328
00:17:48,999 --> 00:17:51,800
- 不是 - 好你说 - 当耶稣…
- No. - Oh, OK. -When Jesus...

329
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,879
那么谁想来点儿酒呢 来点儿吗
So, who'd like some wine? Wine?

330
00:17:53,879 --> 00:17:57,359
这可真搞笑 一定是搞错了
Oh, this is daft, there must have been a mix-up.

331
00:17:57,359 --> 00:17:58,799
我来把这俩个调换一下
I'll just swap this one for it.

332
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:03,560
这样调换座位可不太好吧 这…
I don't think it's fair to disrupt the seating plan, it's...

333
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,799
我想他们不会介意的 不管怎样
Oh, I'm sure they won't mind, anyway,

334
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:10,400
- 我们能坐在一起就好嘛 对吧 - 是啊 真不赖
- it'll be nicer if we're all together, won't it? - Yes. Be lovely.

335
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,080
耶稣会原谅那些坐着大火箭升到
Would Jesus forgive somebody if they flew up to heaven

336
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,159
天堂的人吗
in a big rocket

337
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:17,840
而且如果他刚到天堂
and as soon as he goes to heaven

338
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,959
他就一拳揍到耶稣的脸上 还痛揍了耶稣一顿
he punches Jesus in the face, and he beats Jesus up.

339
00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:25,520
耶稣会说 “我原谅你” 还是
Would Jesus say, "Oh, I forgive you", or would he...

340
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,860
还是会噗呲一下就反击回去
or would he fight back, "Pittsh",

341
00:18:27,861 --> 00:18:30,200
把那人打飞出天堂呢
and knock that man out of heaven?

342
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,699
我不认为能升入
I just can't see a situation

343
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,680
天堂的人
where somebody would get into heaven,

344
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,159
会 会揍耶稣
and... and...punch Jesus.

345
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:36,359
还有 当我…
And also, when I was...

346
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:39,199
圣经所要传达的意思是我们应该宽于待人
The message in the Bible is that we should forgive

347
00:18:39,199 --> 00:18:41,879
更重要的是 耶稣是为了我们而死
and it was important that Jesus died for us.

348
00:18:41,879 --> 00:18:43,319
他为了救我们大家而死的
He died to save us all.

349
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:47,320
所以人类还是有些自私的 对吧
That's a bit selfish of humankind, isn't it?

350
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:51,239
那为什么他不想点儿别的法子 比如写点儿什么警告
Well, couldn't he find another way, like writing to tell them

351
00:18:51,239 --> 00:18:52,737
他们乖一点儿 否则
to be a bit better otherwise

352
00:18:52,738 --> 00:18:55,039
就会有坏事发生了 又或者…
something bad's going to happen, or like...

353
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,439
Oh 上帝啊 呃 我真的得走了
Oh, goodness! Erm, I really must be going...

354
00:18:57,439 --> 00:18:59,960
当耶稣被钉上十字架时…
When Jesus was being crucified...

355
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,680
事实上 我刚意识到那有些人
Actually, I've just realised there's a few people

356
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,959
我必须过去打个招呼
I must go and speak to.

357
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:05,562
让上帝砸下一颗陨石
..Ask God to send a meteorite

358
00:19:05,563 --> 00:19:07,719
摧毁罗马人的部队
and destroy the troops of the Romans...

359
00:19:07,719 --> 00:19:09,919
那就是上帝所选择的方式了
Well, it was the way that God chose.

360
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,119
他决定牺牲自己唯一的儿子
He wanted to sacrifice his only son.

361
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:14,079
他以此彰显此事的重要性
He wanted to show how important it was.

362
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:16,640
他选择了这个世上对他来说最重要的东西
He chose the most precious thing in the world to him,

363
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,719
而这个世上对他来说最重要的东西就是耶稣
and the most precious thing in the world to him was Jesus.

364
00:19:19,719 --> 00:19:23,079
那他为什么想让他死啊
And then why did he kill him?

365
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,520
那你有孩子吗
So, have you got kids?

366
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:32,679
没 没有 你要知道 我的生活大概容不下孩子了
No. No, my lifestyle's never really left any room for it, y'know?

367
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:34,520
我热衷于环游世界
I love my globetrotting too much.

368
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,240
- 这样啊 - 是啊 我效仿不了Sue
- Right. - No, I couldn't do what Sue does.

369
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,480
耶稣说我们应该宽恕他人
Jesus says that you should forgive everybody.

370
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,319
是 说的没错 抱歉 你是谁
Yes, that's right. Sorry you are?

371
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:47,079
她叫Mary 我的助理伴娘
This is Mary, my assistant bridesmaid.

372
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:48,200
好了 我要走了
OK. I'll be off.

373
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,846
那如果有人偷了耶稣的手机
So what would Jesus do if

374
00:19:49,847 --> 00:19:53,440
他还会原谅他们吗
someone stole his mobile, would he forgive them?

375
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,279
对 他会原谅他们 他会的 你是正确的 Ben
Yes, he'd forgive them. yes，he would. you're right, well done, Ben.

376
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:57,760
我现在必须要走了
Now I really must be going.

377
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:02,159
- 等等 最后一个问题 - 那好 - 如果耶稣被一只北极熊袭击
- Wait! One last question. - Ok. - What would Jesus do.

378
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:07,160
- 他会怎么做呢 - 他会灭了它
- if he was attacked by a polar bear? - He would zap him.

379
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:10,119
- 他才不会灭了它 - 这不可能啊
- He wouldn't zap him! - That can't be true.

380
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:13,679
- 北极熊可是要灭绝了啊 - 我不是存心想让你伤心…
- Because polar bears are extinct. - I didn't mean to upset you...

381
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,760
- 你该知道的啊 - 他们才不是呢 他们很危险
- You should know that! - They're not, they're endangered.

382
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,908
不对 因为北极熊很少
No because there's not much of polar bears,

383
00:20:19,909 --> 00:20:21,520
但我们却有很多
but there's lots of us

384
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,280
这个世界上有差不多五万亿的人
there's about five trillion people in the whole world

385
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,040
却只有大概五只北极熊
and there's about five polar bears in the whole world,

386
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,759
- 那我们就应该照顾他们 - 好吧 所以我…
- and so we have to look after them. - All right so I...

387
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:35,559
如果你和一群北极熊遭遇了 那最后的几只
If you went up to a group of polar bears, the last ones,

388
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:37,880
你说 “北极熊 我站在你们那边”
and you said, "Polar bears, I am on your team.

389
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,542
“我们一起猎杀人类吧”
"Lets hunt down the humans",

390
00:20:39,543 --> 00:20:41,799
他们会扑向你 杀了你的
they would pounce on you and kill you.

391
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:44,159
- 好了 孩子们 - 有可能 可我也不是非要那么做 不是吗
- Kids, please. - Probably but I'm never gonna do that, am I?!

392
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,840
- 你真是蠢极了 - 没必要这么说吧 Ben
- You're being so stupid. - There's no need for that, Ben.

393
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,200

我是说 我真的很敬佩她
I mean I really take my hat off to her,

397
00:20:56,759 --> 00:21:00,920
照顾Pete和孩子们 日复一日的 我是说
looking after Pete and the kids, day in, day out, I mean,

398
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:05,959
她总是甘愿成为滑稽的配角 我可做不来
always having to play second banana as it were. I couldn't do that.

是啊 我十分艳羡我的妹妹
No, I've got huge admiration for my little sister.

She's like this lovely supermum and what am I, eh?

401
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:19,399
其实
Well...

402
00:21:19,399 --> 00:21:22,520
每人有每人的活法 是吧
Each to their own, eh?

403
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,240
- 完全正确 - 老爸
- Absolutely... - Dad.

404
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,159
如果每个人都是绝对的相同 那生活一定很无趣
..Life'd be pretty dull if everybody led absolutely identical...

405
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:32,199
- 老爸 - 我正在说着话呢 Jake
- Dad. - I'm in the middle of saying something, Jake.

406
00:21:32,199 --> 00:21:35,239
是 但是 Ben和Karen两个要咬起来了
Yes, but, Ben and Karen are trying to bite each other.

407
00:21:35,239 --> 00:21:36,440
该死的
Oh, shit.

408
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,679
没事儿的 Vicar 我来处理此事
It's OK, Vicar, I'll deal with it.

409
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,439
给我回来
Come back here!

410
00:21:42,439 --> 00:21:46,439
- 我对它们过敏 - 你不对豌豆过敏
- I'm allergic to them! - You are not allergic to peas.

411
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:47,889
没人对豌豆过敏
No-one's allergic to peas,

412
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,120
这世上就没人对豌豆过敏
no-one in the world is allergic to peas.

413
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:55,239
你怎么知道 你又没有问人们
How do you know, because you... you haven't asked the people,

414
00:21:55,239 --> 00:21:59,079
即使你问了 我也知道你在撒谎
even if you did I know you'd be lying

415
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:04,120
因为你没法问印度人 你没法问日本人
because you can't speak Indian, you can't speak Japanese...

416
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,880
你没法问澳大利亚人 还有其他人
you can't speak Australian or any of that.

417
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,479
豌豆专营管理局曾做过调查的
There was a survey by the Pea Marketing Board.

418
00:22:09,479 --> 00:22:11,160
听着 快吃了这些豌豆 拜托啦
Look, just eat the peas, please.

419
00:22:11,161 --> 00:22:12,999
就就就就 不不不…
No, no, no... but, but, but, but...

420
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:20,399
Ben Ben 你不可以把沙丁鱼浸到巧克力喷泉里去
Ben! Ben, you can't dip sardines in the chocolate fountain.

421
00:22:20,399 --> 00:22:22,799
可以的 你能 看啊
Yes, you can! Look!

422
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,280
瞧瞧 他能啊
See! He can!

423
00:22:27,719 --> 00:22:30,839
老爸 穿过那两扇门就是了
Dad! It's through the double doors.

424
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:42,880
老爸的记忆力看起来越发不好了
Dad's memory seems quite a lot worse.

425
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,679
这是个逐步退化的疾病 所以…
Well, it is a degenerative illness, so...

426
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:48,524
他迟早都是要
Sooner or later he's going to have

427
00:22:48,525 --> 00:22:51,239
- 搬离那幢房子的 - 我心里有数
- to move out of that house. - I'm well aware of that.

428
00:22:51,239 --> 00:22:52,995
那你开始着手寻找
So have you started looking into sheltered

429
00:22:52,995 --> 00:22:56,640
- 老年公寓之类的了吗 - 必要时 我们会的 
- accommodation and stuff? - We will, when the time comes.

430
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,160
没必要去否认这件事
There's no point going into denial about it.

431
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:02,759
也许你可以从美国回来 来照顾他
Perhaps you'd like to come back from America and look after him.

432
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,040
好像有次你就是这么说的
Like you once said you would.

433
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:10,042
是啊 这就对了 我刚才还好奇呢 到底多久才…
Oh, yes, here we go. I was wondering how long it would...

434
00:23:10,042 --> 00:23:12,358
听着 我只是不想和你吵
Look, I just don't want to have an argument with you.

435
00:23:12,358 --> 00:23:15,320
让我们别破坏了这一天 那样太没面子了
Let's not spoil the day. It would be a shame.

436
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:20,353
是啊 我们总是能得体优雅的文明处理事情
Yes. We've made a pretty decent fist of keeping things civilized,

437
00:23:20,353 --> 00:23:25,739
不是吗 除去故意把座位分开的小问题不说
haven't we? Apart from the seating arrangement hiccup.

438
00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:27,393
这事儿和我毫无关系
That was nothing to do with me.

439
00:23:27,393 --> 00:23:28,760
拜托 莫非你真以为
Oh, come on, do you really think...

440
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:32,999
你爱信不信 我就是不想和你吵
You can believe what you like, I am just not going to fight with you.

441
00:23:32,999 --> 00:23:36,239
好了 谁想喝一杯 那儿有个现卖吧台
Right, who wants a drink? It's a cash bar now.

The other bridesmaid's got three pets. Can we get one?

443
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:43,439
- 不行 - 没门
- No. - No.

444
00:23:43,439 --> 00:23:45,230
你可真是个漂亮的伴娘啊 Karen
You made a lovely bridesmaid, Karen.

445
00:23:45,231 --> 00:23:47,639
你做过伴娘吗
Have you ever been a bridesmaid?

446
00:23:47,639 --> 00:23:49,199
做过啊 做过几次
Yeah. A couple of times.

447
00:23:49,199 --> 00:23:53,000
- 但没做过新娘 - 没有
- But never a bride. - No.

448
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:59,600
- 为什么啊 - 我 我没有你老妈那么幸运
- Why? - Well, I... I wasn't as lucky as your mummy.

449
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,760
我不想对第一个求婚的男人点头说“我愿意”
I didn't want to say "Yes" To the first man who asked me.

450
00:24:11,342 --> 00:24:13,254
我们最好打道回府吧
We'd best be making tracks.

451
00:24:13,254 --> 00:24:15,649
是 是啊 你说的没错
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

You got to allow for the A3 this time of night.

抱歉 我们要回去了
Sorry... We're going to head off now,

460
00:24:46,636 --> 00:24:47,740
我只想过来和你说一句
so I just thought I'd come

461
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,252
这婚宴真是太棒了

00:24:52,146 --> 00:24:55,559
- 她全身心的投入其中了 - 是啊 她就是这样的孩子
- She certainly threw herself into it. - Yes, she's that kind of kid.

464
00:24:56,214 --> 00:24:59,208
她把我以前的男友进行严刑逼供呢
She gave me the old third degree about my boyfriends.

465
00:24:59,371 --> 00:24:59,879
抱歉
Oh, sorry.

466
00:25:00,768 --> 00:25:03,903
她看起来对他们其中的大多数了如指掌啊
Yeah, she seemed to know quite a lot about most of them.

467
00:25:03,903 --> 00:25:06,774
你晓得的 那个年龄段的孩子大都如此
Well, you know what girls that age are like.

468
00:25:06,774 --> 00:25:11,035
是啊 我晓得 还问我“谁是Ulrika啊”
Oh, yes, I do. Full of questions, like, "Who's Ulrika?"

469
00:25:13,471 --> 00:25:16,031
- 那个 我们得走了啊 - 真高兴Angela也能来

- Don't you want to know what she said? - No.

474
00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:28,946
她说 Jake很有可能是个同性恋
She said Jake is probably gay,

475
00:25:28,946 --> 00:25:31,427
因为他对花样的装饰物特着迷
because he's obsessed with floral displays,

476
00:25:31,427 --> 00:25:35,267
她说 Karen是个被宠坏 而且爱控制人的孩子
she thinks Karen is spoilt and manipulative,

477
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:38,586
她还说 Ben一副早期精神病患者的样子
and she thinks that Ben is a trainee psychotic.

478
00:25:38,586 --> 00:25:42,147
- 是嘛 - 还有啊 Pete弱得像个娘们
- Right. - And Pete is "Weaker than a nun's piss".

479
00:25:42,147 --> 00:25:46,787
这个说法是不是很有趣啊 弱的像个娘们
Isn't that a funny expression? "Weaker than a nun's piss".

480
00:25:46,787 --> 00:25:50,227
好了 还是要谢谢你的款待了

真抱歉麻烦你帮我家的孩子们调停
I'm so sorry you had to separate our children.

485
00:26:02,881 --> 00:26:04,167
没什么 没事儿
Oh, no problem, no problem.

486
00:26:04,167 --> 00:26:06,202

They really are a lively pair, aren't they?

487
00:26:06,202 --> 00:26:08,080
- 活泼吗 还真是呢 - 是的
- Lively, they are. - Yes.

488
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,715

- Yeah. - Yes, I'm still pondering the question,

489
00:26:10,715 --> 00:26:12,652
“耶稣会不会也怕遇到氪星陨石呢”
"Is Jesus vulnerable to kryptonite?"

- Mum, do you know jail? - Yes, I know jail.

493
00:26:28,524 --> 00:26:31,444
那是不是非常调皮的人才会被送进去呢
Well, is it just like a big naughty step?

494
00:26:31,444 --> 00:26:36,085
是啊 正如你所说的一样 没错
Yeah, that's exactly what it is. Yeah.

495
00:26:36,085 --> 00:26:40,685
- 但是只有高墙和大狗 - 是啊
- But only with walls and dogs. - Yeah.

496
00:26:40,685 --> 00:26:42,244
回到床上去 不 Ben 不行
Back up to bed. No, Ben, no!

497
00:26:42,244 --> 00:26:46,365
- 让我过去 - 不行 Ben - 为什么我不能看足球
- Let me past. - No Ben! - Why can't I watch the football?

498
00:26:46,365 --> 00:26:48,325
因为已经很晚了 好了 赶紧上去
Because it is late. C'mon. Up you go.

499
00:26:48,325 --> 00:26:51,885
但我一整天的表现都很好啊
But I've been on my best behaviour all day long.

500
00:26:51,885 --> 00:26:54,794
先前就告诫过你 “不打架
You were specifically told "No fighting,

501
00:26:54,795 --> 00:26:57,485
不骂人 不喝酒”
no swearing and no drinking alcohol",

502
00:26:57,485 --> 00:26:58,750
我可是当场抓到你
and I caught you bashing

503
00:26:58,751 --> 00:27:00,964
往墙上打那个孩子的头部 还大吼着
that kid's head on the floor and shouting,

504
00:27:00,964 --> 00:27:03,045
“你该死的别碰我的啤酒” 得了吧
"Don't touch my bloody beer". Come on.

505
00:27:03,045 --> 00:27:05,725
- 那是因为他不尊重我啊 - 少来了 睡觉去
- But he was disrespecting me. - Come on. Back to bed.

506
00:27:05,725 --> 00:27:10,845
如果你进了监狱的话 他们还会让你晚上回家吗
If you went to jail would they let you come home at night?

507
00:27:10,845 --> 00:27:14,124
我可不会进监狱的啊 你怎么会这么想呢
I'm not going to go to jail! What made you think of that?

508
00:27:14,124 --> 00:27:17,325
如果你在街上遇到某人 又揍了他的话
If you went up to somebody in the street and punched them,

509
00:27:17,325 --> 00:27:22,645
- 你会进监狱的吧 - 这个嘛 也有可能
- would you go to jail? - Well...erm, probably.

510
00:27:24,365 --> 00:27:29,325
