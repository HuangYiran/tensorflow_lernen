*You're like a needle in a haystack*

348
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,830
*I wanna sit you where my face at*

*I wanna feel what a real fat ass like*

355
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,300
*No injection, I learned my lesson*

356
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,370
*I walk it like I talk it, baby this pedestrian*

357
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,090
*Runnin' through your mind like Jackie Joyner*

358
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:54,750
*Pussy like pop, go give me a burner*

359
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,890
*Got shot like pop*

360
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,280
*This can be detrimental*

361
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,340
*T-shirt and panties, that's your credential*

362
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,210
*You're cotton candy, I need a fistful*

363
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,060
*I'm often antsy, hope that convince you*

364
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,670

*You know you're lookin' so damn fine*

366
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:13,310

*I gotta give it to you*

376
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,990
*I need you to move it*

377
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,810

378
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:51,000
*I gotta, I gotta... I gotta give it to you*

379
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:14,610
各位观众  有请Iggy Azalea和Lil Kim

380
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:30,770
我们先向布鲁克林女王致敬

381
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:34,730
她激励了我和众多歌手

382
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:35,570
布鲁克林的观众们

383
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:38,630
为女王Lil Kim欢呼吧

384
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:47,170
音乐电视大奖居然在布鲁克林举办了

385
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,540
我的天呐

386

我爱死你们啦

387
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,410
我在布鲁克林长大

388
00:19:55,410 --> 00:20:03,170
从未想过VMA会来到我的家乡

389
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,690
布鲁克林小子们

390
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:10,230
了不起的布鲁克林小子们

391
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,500
布鲁克林崛起啦

392
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,090
嘻哈音乐已席卷全球

393
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:28,060
澳大利亚的Iggy也站在了我身边

394
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,200
这充分证明嘻哈音乐走向了世界

395
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,570
请看"最佳嘻哈录影带奖"的提名

00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:41,490
Macklemore & Ryan Lewis

409
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:42,910
天呐

410
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:17,070

谢谢  太感谢啦

413
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,100
我喜欢这首歌

414
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:41,140
独立嘻哈歌手也上音乐电视大奖啦

415
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:48,170
首先  向其他提名者致敬

416
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:51,640
我们居然拿到了一座月球人奖杯

417
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,450
这真是太疯狂了

418
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:54,000
一切起源于一个想法

419
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,920
有这么一面旗帜

420
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,420
象征着我们的旅途

421
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:59,800
这面旗帜将走遍世界

422
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:03,670
我们有很多想法

423
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:08,100
我想乘海盗船  骑骆驼

424
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:11,550
跟雷鬼头同伴去冰穴冒险

425

你们好

00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,500

我是你们的忠实粉丝

643
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,280
我想感谢粉丝们

644
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,660
我经常发推说这事儿

645
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,710
我真的很想拿这个奖

646

非常谢谢你们的支持

647

我很幸运

00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:08,710
因为影片导演Anthony Mandler

和联合主演Reeve Carney今晚都在场

650
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:13,040
我很高兴他们都在场

651
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:15,150
这感觉真是太棒了

652
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:18,290
我还想感谢给了我写这歌灵感的人

"最佳男歌手录影带奖"候选人Ed Sheeran

659
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,000
大家好

660
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,750
音乐录影带不仅仅能用来娱乐

661
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:53,190
它们能改变我们看世界的方法

662
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,680
并激励我们行动起来

663
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,860
接下来的录影带是其中佼佼者

664
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:59,840
下面是"最励志录像带奖"提名

665
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,720
Beyoncé  《I Was Here》

00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:04,730
Kelly Clarkson  《People Like Us》

667
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:07,540

00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,700
"最励志录像带奖"的得主是

673
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,200
Macklemore & Ryan Lewis和Mary Lambert

674
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,220
《Same Love》

675
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:00,060
实话实说

676
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:05,390
我最想赢得"最佳说唱录影带奖"

677
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:08,910
但是此时此刻这个奖的意义更深远

678
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:19,910
我从十五岁左右开始创作歌曲

679
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:24,100
在我所写的所有歌曲中

680
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:27,930
这首歌对我而言最为重要

681
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,690
去年这首歌红遍全球

682
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:44,140
见证了美国正发生的重大变化

683
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:54,280
同性恋权利就是人权

684
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,000
这两者密不可分

685
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:03,750
我们创作了这首歌

686
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:06,750
但是不知道如何做好这支录影带

687
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,700
是Ryan Lewis  Tricia Davis

688
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,360
和Jon Jon Augustavo

689
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,540
让这首歌焕发生机

690
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,190
制作《Same Love》的团队

691
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:19,590
是制作《Can't Hold Us》和

692
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:20,400
《Thrift Shop》的原班人马

693
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,310
这些歌曲的录影带都靠我们自己完成

694
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:25,160
有一些人的名字我必须提及

695
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:29,930
Noah Jolles和小号手Owuor Arunga

696
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,920
非常感谢  再次感谢我们的歌迷

697
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,660
这对我们来说意义重大

698
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:37,560
当然还要感谢Mary Lambert

699
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:55,380
您仍有时间来决定Katy Perry的先行单曲

女士们先生们  掌声欢迎Jimmy Fallon

704
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:33,700
在近11年前的2002年

705
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:39,200
我在无线电城音乐厅主持了当年的VMA

706
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:44,800
那夜将载入史册

707
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,480
当然不是因我主持的缘故

708
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,460
而是因为那晚一位新晋的单飞歌手

709
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:51,630
首次登台演出

710
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:58,410
他的名字是Justin Timberlake

711
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,940
正如人们所说  他创造了历史

712
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:09,350
布鲁克林  世界已经聚焦于此

713
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:11,630
让我们来听听现场的欢呼

714
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,690
他将令你心醉神迷

欢迎Justin Timberlake

717
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:32,700

*Pull you nearer 'til you feel it again, oh*

733
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:27,740
*(I wanna do something right) alright*

734
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:29,730
*But we can do something better*

735
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:31,700
*Ain’t no time like tonight*

736
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:34,210
*And we ain't trying to save it 'til later*

737
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:36,160
*Stay out here living the life*

738
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,550
*Nobody cares who we are tomorrow*

739

*And I can't help but notice, you reflect in this heart of mine*

969
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:27,550
*If you ever feel alone and the glare makes me hard to find*

00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:40,250
*I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go*

974
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:42,140
*Just put your hand on the past* 

975
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:43,440
*I'm here tryin' to pull you through*

976

*And I'll tell you baby, it was easy*

984
00:56:03,710 --> 00:56:07,100
*Comin' back into you once I figured it out*

985
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:09,670
*You were right here all along*

986
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:11,430
一起来  再来一遍

987
00:56:11,430 --> 00:56:13,420
*It's like you're my mirror*

988
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:16,710
*My mirror staring back at me*

989
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:19,670
*I couldn't get any bigger*

990
00:56:20,350 --> 00:56:23,020
*With anyone else beside of me *

991
00:56:23,470 --> 00:56:25,680
*And now it's clear as this promise*

992
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:30,230
*That we're making two reflections into one*

993
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:32,110
*'Cause it's like you're my mirror*

994
00:56:33,230 --> 00:56:36,390
*My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me *

995
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:37,230

1011
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:13,880
我可以用长篇大论阐述Justin何德何能受此殊荣

1012
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:16,870

1018

1049
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:24,440
我不配这个奖

1050
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:26,150
可我不打算把奖还回去

1051

01:02:18,210 --> 01:02:19,870
最新的封面女郎Becky G

1080
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:21,830
看起来美极了  那光泽满满的双唇

1081
01:02:21,830 --> 01:02:24,300
当然还有Rita Ora代表英国而来

1082
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:26,790
- 她化什么妆都好看  - 的确

1083
01:02:26,790 --> 01:02:27,590
根据我们的观察

1084
01:02:27,590 --> 01:02:29,600
很明显  夸张的眼妆和大胆的唇妆

1085
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:31,510
是今年的流行趋势

1086
01:02:31,510 --> 01:02:32,670

让我们去看看谁获奖了

1101
01:03:14,990 --> 01:03:22,170
首先  掌声送给DJ Cassidy的表现

1102
01:03:22,170 --> 01:03:23,790
向他致以无尽的爱意

1103
01:03:23,790 --> 01:03:25,700
布鲁克林  你们好吗

1104
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:28,900
我是DJ Cassidy  走起

1105
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:30,800
*Calling all hearts*

1106
01:03:33,270 --> 01:03:36,260
*To the dance floor tonight*

1107
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:37,460
我们开始吧

1108
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:41,530
我要简单提一下  各位

1109
01:03:41,530 --> 01:03:44,030
大家要清楚  我不是在主持

1110
01:03:44,030 --> 01:03:46,200
他们老是要我干这干那

1111
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:47,950
但现在我上台了

1112
01:03:47,950 --> 01:03:50,050
我想说说我刚才看的表演

1113
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:55,140
首先  Justin Timberlake秒杀全场

1114
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:57,980
掌声送给Justin Timberlake

1115
01:03:58,790 --> 01:04:01,690
朋友们  他表演了将近20分钟

1116
01:04:01,690 --> 01:04:02,930
实在太精彩了

1117
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:06,410
他还把N'Sync带回来了  我的天

1118
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,330
我知道N'Sync生气了

1119
01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:11,630
因为怡芳只让他们表演了一首歌

1120
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:13,710
他们绝对是生气了

1121
01:04:13,710 --> 01:04:14,900
他们身材也走形了

1122
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:16,910
他们发福了  对吧

1123
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:20,500
他们跳舞的时候可累了

1124
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:25,560
我看到Joey放屁了

1125
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:26,540
爱放屁的Joey

1126
01:04:26,550 --> 01:04:27,740
你好  屁精

1127
01:04:30,510 --> 01:04:32,040
天呐

1128
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:34,430
不过说真的  他的表演很精彩

1129
01:04:34,430 --> 01:04:36,230
Justin  我向你致敬

1130
01:04:36,670 --> 01:04:39,370
在宣布正事前我想说最后一句话

1131
01:04:39,370 --> 01:04:41,220
Lady Gaga还在现场吗

1132
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:42,740
她的翘臀太火辣了

1133
01:04:43,810 --> 01:04:47,570
天呐  Lady Gaga  我的妈呀

1134
01:04:47,570 --> 01:04:49,140
回座位时我要走过你的身旁

1135
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:51,250
故意扔个东西在地上

1136
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:53,740
只为把我的脸靠近你的翘臀

1137
01:04:55,060 --> 01:04:56,230
我会这么做的

1138
01:04:56,230 --> 01:04:59,050
下面我们进入正题吧

1139
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,890
为Kanye鼓掌欢呼吧

1140
01:05:01,950 --> 01:05:03,560
为他的疯狂表演欢呼

1141
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:06,120
他刚才就像个神

1142
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:06,720
你虽然看得到他

1143
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:07,660
却不确定他是否在那儿

1144
01:05:07,660 --> 01:05:08,410
像个影子  若隐若现

1145
01:05:08,410 --> 01:05:09,750
我很喜欢  很棒

1146
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:12,860

1161
01:06:02,780 --> 01:06:05,060
今年夏天  不管你身在何处

1162
01:06:05,250 --> 01:06:07,410
总有一些歌曲随处都可以听到

1163
01:06:07,470 --> 01:06:09,970
它们会出现在每位DJ的歌单上

1164
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:13,240
在每个沙滩派对和烧烤聚会上播放

1165
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:17,710
但只有一首歌能当选"夏日最佳歌曲"

感谢所有为我们投票的人

1183
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:28,530
这对我们来说意义重大

1184
01:08:28,750 --> 01:08:30,420
这位是录影带的导演

1185
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:32,280
都是他的主意  Bes Winston

1186
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:33,820
谢谢

1187
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:38,780
Harry说啥我说啥

1188
01:08:40,540 --> 01:08:42,770
过去三年粉丝为我们做的

1189
01:08:42,770 --> 01:08:44,660
实在难以置信  非常感谢

1190
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:47,090
我们的电影下周末就会推出了

1191
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:48,310
这座月球人对我们意义重大

1192
01:08:48,310 --> 01:08:49,060
最后再对你们说一声

1193
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:50,660

在我出柜之前

1197
01:09:14,190 --> 01:09:16,860
我的奶奶对我说  她很担心

1198
01:09:16,860 --> 01:09:21,040
我会像她在南方家乡时那样

1199
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:23,960
遭受歧视和偏见

1200
01:09:24,350 --> 01:09:25,650
我知道  

1201
01:09:25,650 --> 01:09:34,450
性取向歧视和种族歧视本质相同

1202
01:09:42,750 --> 01:09:45,210
只有一个办法能改变别人的看法

1203
01:09:45,210 --> 01:09:48,540
就是勇敢地捍卫你的信仰

1204
01:09:53,330 --> 01:09:56,760
朋友们  我的专辑《Trap Lord》已经发售了

1205
01:09:57,970 --> 01:10:00,480
下一位表演嘉宾是我的好朋友

1206
01:10:00,490 --> 01:10:02,640
他勇敢地捍卫着他的一切信仰

1207
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:07,600
无论是人人平等  种族还是同性恋

1208
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:08,730
请把尖叫声献给我的兄弟

1209
01:10:08,730 --> 01:10:11,670
白人典范  Macklemore和Ryan Lewis

1210
01:10:11,670 --> 01:10:12,910
大家嗨起来

1211
01:10:27,830 --> 01:10:29,390
*When I was in the 3rd grade*

1212
01:10:29,390 --> 01:10:30,560
*I thought that I was gay*

1213
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,190
*'Cause I could draw, my uncle was*

1214
01:10:32,190 --> 01:10:33,950
*And I kept my room straight*

1215
01:10:33,950 --> 01:10:35,010
*I told my mom*

1216
01:10:35,010 --> 01:10:36,240
*Tears rushing down my face*

1217
01:10:36,250 --> 01:10:37,650
*She's like, Ben you've loved girls* 

1218
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:39,250
*Since before pre-K*

1219
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:40,240
*Tripping yeah*

1220
01:10:40,670 --> 01:10:42,210
*I guess she had a point, didn't she*

1221
01:10:42,210 --> 01:10:44,930
*A bunch of stereotypes all in my head*

1222
01:10:44,930 --> 01:10:46,040
*I remember doing the math like*

1223
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:47,750
*Yeah I'm good at little league*

1224
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:50,080
*A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant*

1225
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:51,840
*For those that like the same sex*

1226
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,370
*Had the characteristics*

1227
01:10:53,370 --> 01:10:55,100
*The right-wing conservatives think* 

1228
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:56,030
*It's a decision*

1229
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:57,750
*And you can be cured with*

1230
01:10:57,750 --> 01:10:58,940
*Some treatment and religion*

1231
01:10:58,940 --> 01:11:01,720
*Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition*

1232
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:02,970
*Playing God*

1233
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:04,750
*Ahh nah, here we go*

1234
01:11:04,750 --> 01:11:06,030
*America the brave*

1235
01:11:06,030 --> 01:11:07,560
*Still fears what we don't know*

1236
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:08,850
*And God loves all his children*

1237
01:11:08,850 --> 01:11:10,000
*It's somehow forgotten*

1238
01:11:10,010 --> 01:11:11,530
*But we paraphrase a book written*

1239
01:11:11,530 --> 01:11:13,460
*3,500 years ago*

1240
01:11:14,350 --> 01:11:15,290
*I don't know*

1241
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:18,040
*And I can't change*

1242
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:23,160
*Even if I tried*

1243
01:11:23,430 --> 01:11:26,640
*Even if I wanted to*

1244
01:11:26,670 --> 01:11:28,950
*And I can't change*

1245
01:11:29,090 --> 01:11:31,820
*Even if I tried*

1246
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:35,550
*Even if I wanted to*

1247
01:11:35,740 --> 01:11:37,390
*My love my love my love*

1248
01:11:37,390 --> 01:11:39,840
*She keeps me warm*

1249
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:42,930
*She keeps me warm*

1250
01:11:42,940 --> 01:11:45,730
*She keeps me warm*

1251
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:48,640
*She keeps me warm*

1252
01:11:50,210 --> 01:11:51,210
*If I was gay*

1253
01:11:51,210 --> 01:11:53,060
*I would think hip-hop hates me*

1254
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:55,730
*Have you read the YouTube comments lately*

1255
01:11:55,830 --> 01:11:56,900
*Man that's gay*

1256
01:11:56,910 --> 01:11:58,170
*Gets dropped on the daily*

1257
01:11:58,170 --> 01:12:00,400
*We've become so numb to what we're saying*

1258
01:12:00,410 --> 01:12:02,740
*Our culture founded from oppression*

1259
01:12:02,740 --> 01:12:04,110
*Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em*

1260
01:12:04,110 --> 01:12:05,070
*Call each other faggots*

1261
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:06,900
*Behind the keys of a message board*

1262
01:12:06,910 --> 01:12:08,140
*A word rooted in hate*

1263
01:12:08,140 --> 01:12:09,950
*Yet our genre still ignores it*

1264
01:12:09,950 --> 01:12:12,150
*Gay is synonymous with the lesser*

1265
01:12:12,820 --> 01:12:15,270
*It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion*

1266
01:12:15,310 --> 01:12:16,450
*Gender to skin color*

1267
01:12:16,450 --> 01:12:18,060
*Complexion of your pigment*

1268
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:19,310
*The same fight that lead people*

1269
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:20,610
*To walk-outs and sit-ins*

1270
01:12:20,610 --> 01:12:22,220
*Human rights for everybody*

1271
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:23,660
*There is no difference*

1272
01:12:23,660 --> 01:12:26,200
*Live on! And be yourself*

1273
01:12:26,510 --> 01:12:27,170
*When I was in church*

1274
01:12:27,170 --> 01:12:28,790
*They taught me something else*

1275
01:12:29,070 --> 01:12:30,680
*If you preach hate at the service*

1276
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:31,940
*Those words aren't anointed*

1277
01:12:31,940 --> 01:12:32,830
*And that Holy Water*

1278
01:12:32,830 --> 01:12:34,080
*That you soak in*

1279
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:34,760
*Is then poisoned*

1280
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:35,730
*When everyone else*

1281
01:12:35,730 --> 01:12:36,630
*Is more comfortable*

1282
01:12:36,630 --> 01:12:37,620
*Remaining voiceless*

1283
01:12:37,630 --> 01:12:39,090
*Rather than fighting for humans*

1284
01:12:39,090 --> 01:12:40,970
*That have had their rights stolen*

1285
01:12:41,070 --> 01:12:42,240
*I might not be the same*

1286
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:43,290
*But that's not important*

1287
01:12:43,290 --> 01:12:44,790
*No freedom till we're equal*

1288
01:12:44,790 --> 01:12:46,670
*Damn right I support it*

1289
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:56,910
*I don't know*

1290
01:12:56,910 --> 01:12:59,030
*And I can't change*

1291
01:12:59,350 --> 01:13:02,100
*Even if I tried*

1292
01:13:02,260 --> 01:13:05,840
*Even if I wanted to*

1293
01:13:06,150 --> 01:13:07,750
*My love, my love, my love*

1294
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:10,170
*She keeps me warm*

1295
01:13:10,170 --> 01:13:13,270
*She keeps me warm*

1296
01:13:13,270 --> 01:13:16,160
*She keeps me warm*

1297
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:19,050
*She keeps me warm*		

1298
01:13:21,110 --> 01:13:21,970
*We press play*

1299
01:13:21,970 --> 01:13:23,080
*Don't press pause*

1300
01:13:23,780 --> 01:13:24,900
*Progress, march on*

1301
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:26,460
*With a veil over our eyes*

1302
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:27,940
*We turn our back on the cause*

1303
01:13:27,940 --> 01:13:30,430
*'Till the day that my uncles can be united by law*

1304
01:13:30,430 --> 01:13:32,490
*Kids are walkin' around the hallway*

1305
01:13:32,590 --> 01:13:33,960
*Plagued by pain in their heart*

1306
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:34,760
*A world so hateful*

1307
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:35,680
*Some would rather die*

1308
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:37,120
*Than be who they are*

1309
01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:38,430
*And a certificate on paper*

1310
01:13:38,430 --> 01:13:39,960
*Isn't gonna solve it all*

1311
01:13:39,970 --> 01:13:42,210
*But it's a damn good place to start*

1312
01:13:42,710 --> 01:13:44,300
*No law's gonna change us*

1313
01:13:44,310 --> 01:13:45,690
*We have to change us*

1314
01:13:45,690 --> 01:13:46,820
*Whatever god you believe in*

1315
01:13:46,830 --> 01:13:48,690
*We come from the same one*

1316
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:49,680
*Strip away the fear*

1317
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:51,600
*Underneath it's all the same love*

1318
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:53,550
*About time that we raised up*

1319
01:13:53,550 --> 01:13:55,760
*And I can't change*

1320

01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:06,650
*She keeps me warm*

1324
01:14:06,650 --> 01:14:09,830

金发妞  快滚开

1345

但是我喜欢

1347
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:49,020

我和你说  下一位艺人...

1395
01:18:55,970 --> 01:19:00,920
我在后台用耳机3D环绕听歌

1396
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:03,060
听着Avila Brothers的歌嗨到不行

1397

让我告诉你

1398
01:19:03,790 --> 01:19:09,000
如果这位歌手邀你参加他加拿大的演唱会

1399
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:09,920
你知道要怎么办

1400
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:11,610
- 我们得去啊  - 必须出现

1401
01:19:11,610 --> 01:19:12,800
必须去啊

1402
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:15,200
