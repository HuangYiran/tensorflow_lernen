还要上几层楼
How far am I gonna go up?

16
00:01:14,385 --> 00:01:18,385
我们讲述的故事

17
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,796
- 三段台阶 - 走吧
- Three flights. - Just keep going.

18
00:01:18,938 --> 00:01:20,406
走不动就歇会吧
Take a break when you need to.

19
00:01:26,012 --> 00:01:26,944
好嘞
Jolly good.

20
00:01:29,682 --> 00:01:31,707
终于到了 你好
Here we are, then. Hi.

21
00:01:51,707 --> 00:01:53,436
- 好 - 把这个放在这里
- Right. - Put this here.

22
00:01:55,342 --> 00:01:56,935
好啦
Right, then.

23
00:01:57,078 --> 00:01:59,376
让我们来瞧瞧...
Let's have a look and see... Oh.

24
00:01:59,514 --> 00:02:01,812
这是前半部分
So this is the first half.

25
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:02,974
什么 亲爱的？
This is what, love?

26
00:02:03,117 --> 00:02:04,778
这是我们要录的前半部分
The first half of what we're recording.

27
00:02:06,923 --> 00:02:08,356
这么多全要我念一遍么
I'm going to do the whole lot?

28
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:09,981
是啊 而且这只是一半
Yeah, there's another...

29
00:02:11,161 --> 00:02:12,923
- 全都要？ - 嗯
- All this? - Yeah.

30
00:02:13,062 --> 00:02:14,963
我写的全在这儿了
It's the whole of the thing that I wrote.

31
00:02:15,097 --> 00:02:16,860
简直跟自我惩罚似的
It's a thing of punishment.

32
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:25,800
这杯茶是谁的
Whose tea is that?

33
00:02:28,111 --> 00:02:29,373
我知道
I know.

34
00:02:29,512 --> 00:02:32,481
我在想等会我可能会紧张得全身湿透
I just think that I might be sweating through my shirt.

35
00:02:32,616 --> 00:02:33,777
我准备好了
Yeah. I'm ready.

36
00:02:33,918 --> 00:02:35,214
这个放在旁边
Keep it handy.

37
00:02:37,021 --> 00:02:38,250
我不喜欢这样
I don't like this.

38
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,880
- 你紧张么 - 有点
- Are you nervous? - A little.

39
00:02:41,293 --> 00:02:42,281
会越来越紧张的
It'll get worse.

40
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:08,012
希望你以后能给我解释下
I hope you'll explain to me sometime

41
00:03:08,155 --> 00:03:10,589
你到底想做一部什么东西
what all this is that you're trying to do.

42
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:15,319
有两台摄像机在拍我录音的过程
With two cameras and me recording it visually.

43
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:16,690
怎么了么
What about it?

44
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,262
记录片一般不是这么拍的吧
It's not the normal way of doing it, is it?

45
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:19,558
我也不知道
I don't know.

46
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:22,732
我之前和你说这是部纪录片 但其实...
We've told you it's a documentary,but it's actually...

47
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,269
我们是要审问你
It's an interrogation process.

48
00:03:24,406 --> 00:03:25,395
什么？
What?

49
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,633
其实这是一个审问的过程
It's an interrogation process that we've set up.

50
00:03:31,046 --> 00:03:32,673
我真的需要镇静剂
I honestly need pills.

51
00:03:34,015 --> 00:03:35,004
真的么？
Do you really?

52
00:03:35,149 --> 00:03:36,377
- 我好紧张 - 真的么
- I'm so nervous. - Are you really?

53
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:37,950
我的牙看着还好吧
Are my teeth okay?

54
00:03:39,822 --> 00:03:41,585
我觉得我开始出汗了
I feel like I'm sweating.

55
00:03:41,724 --> 00:03:42,815
镜头对准没
What's my frame?

56
00:03:42,957 --> 00:03:45,392
我的胸不会很大吧
How are my breasts?

57
00:03:46,295 --> 00:03:48,264
好啦 尽管来拍
Okay. Showtime.

58
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,648
啊？镜头现在对着我么？
Me? Do you want me?

59
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:15,053
不好意思
Oh, I'm sorry.

60
00:04:24,501 --> 00:04:28,064
好了 爸 我们随时可以开始
Okay, Dad,so we can start any time.

61
00:04:28,207 --> 00:04:29,195
开机了么 好
Are you rolling? Yeah.

62
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,603
好吧
Okay.

63
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:32,699
开始了
We're off.

64
00:04:33,378 --> 00:04:35,539
从故事的最初到结束
In the beginning, the end.

65
00:04:35,681 --> 00:04:38,013
我都是独一无二的存在
I am unique.

66
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:39,344
准确来说
From that precise moment

67
00:04:39,485 --> 00:04:41,386
在我与母亲的子宫分离
when I was dragged out of my mother's womb

68
00:04:41,521 --> 00:04:43,147
降生这冰冷世界的那一刻起
into this cold world,

69
00:04:43,857 --> 00:04:45,381
我就成为了完整的个体
I was complete...

70
00:04:45,525 --> 00:04:48,085
我的基因组
an amalgam of the DNA passed on to me

71
00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:49,923
是母亲与父亲的集合
by my mother and father,

72
00:04:50,063 --> 00:04:52,965
他们也和我一样
and they too had been born finished products,

73
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,125
是各自父母的基因集合
with their DNA handed down by their respective parents,

74
00:04:56,269 --> 00:04:59,034
如此逆推 无穷无尽
and so back ad infinitum.

75
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:01,573
因此 我的年龄与先祖等长
It is clear to me that I was always there,

76
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:06,009
相同的基因不断向下传递 只待出生的一刻
somewhere in my ancestors' DNA,just waiting to be born.

77
00:05:06,147 --> 00:05:09,014
这个独一无二的人
So this unique guy has always existed,

78
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,244
起源甚至可以追溯到浑沌时代
even in the mystery of nothingness.

79
00:05:12,287 --> 00:05:13,845
那么 我们该从哪里开始
So where to start?

80
00:05:14,556 --> 00:05:17,252
爸 能把整个故事讲给我们听么
Dad, can you tell the whole story?

81
00:05:17,392 --> 00:05:19,019
你为什么和妈结婚
The marriage to Mom

82
00:05:19,161 --> 00:05:20,526
以及在这之后发生的全部的事
and everything that happened since?

83
00:05:24,566 --> 00:05:25,556
天啊
Good God.

84
00:05:27,671 --> 00:05:29,466
整个故事？
The entire story?

85
00:05:29,604 --> 00:05:33,302
我现在要你把整个故事讲一遍
I'm gonna ask you now to tell the whole story

86
00:05:33,442 --> 00:05:35,070
假装我是对这个故事一无所知的人
as though I don't know the story,

87
00:05:35,211 --> 00:05:37,406
从开始到最后
from the very beginning to the very end.

88
00:05:37,547 --> 00:05:38,844
妈呀
Shit.

89
00:05:40,184 --> 00:05:41,776
你可以把这个故事
Can you tell this whole story

90
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:43,250
用自己的话从头到尾讲一遍么
from beginning to end in your own words?

91
00:05:43,387 --> 00:05:45,218
就像给别人说故事那样
Like, as though you're telling a story to someone.

92
00:05:45,355 --> 00:05:46,344
像串烧歌那样
Like a medley.

93
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:47,650
- 串烧歌 - 就是这样
- A medley. - Yeah, okay.

94
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:51,252
你可以把整个故事
Can you describe the whole story

95
00:05:51,395 --> 00:05:54,991
用自己的话从头到尾讲述一遍么
from the beginning until now in your own words?

96
00:05:55,133 --> 00:05:56,156
什么？
What?

97
00:06:09,747 --> 00:06:12,342
你觉得拍摄这部纪录片的主意怎么样
What do you think of this documentary being made?

98
00:06:14,955 --> 00:06:16,046
怎么想的就怎么说吧
You can be totally candid.

99
00:06:16,188 --> 00:06:17,280
可以吗
Can I?

100
00:06:17,423 --> 00:06:18,913
好多人都和我直说了
A lot of people have been.

101
00:06:20,292 --> 00:06:23,056
我觉得我的本能反应是
I guess I have this instinctive reaction of

102
00:06:23,195 --> 00:06:25,220
『谁他妈的在乎我们家的那点事啊？』
who fucking cares about our family?

103
00:06:25,364 --> 00:06:26,889
说了粗话不要紧吧
Can I swear?

104
00:06:27,033 --> 00:06:29,695
『谁在乎我们家的事啊？』
Who cares about our stupid family?

105
00:06:31,606 --> 00:06:32,800
我有点尴尬
I'm sort of embarrassed,

106
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,130
因为这是我们自己的故事
'cause I think it's our family,

107
00:06:35,274 --> 00:06:36,936
每个家庭都有自己的故事
and every family has a story.

108
00:06:37,077 --> 00:06:38,669
不过我觉得这很有意思
But I do think it's really interesting

109
00:06:38,812 --> 00:06:41,873
你可以回顾往事
to look at this one thing that happened

110
00:06:42,015 --> 00:06:45,145
看看它在不同人眼中的不同模样
and how it's refracted in so many different ways,

111
00:06:45,287 --> 00:06:47,312
有太多不同的视角
and there's so many different angles.

112
00:06:48,457 --> 00:06:49,515
可不可以
I guess if you could start

113
00:06:49,658 --> 00:06:52,683
从尽可能细节地描述下妈妈开始
by describing Mom in as much detail as possible.

114
00:06:52,827 --> 00:06:55,160
哦 好啊 妈 妈
Oh. Well, Mom, Mom.

115
00:06:55,296 --> 00:06:57,560
我更喜欢称呼她『妈』而不是『黛安』
I will refer her to as "Mom," not Diane.

116
00:06:59,301 --> 00:07:02,202
她给了我很多童年的快乐回忆
She was the most fun I could think of as a child.

117
00:07:02,337 --> 00:07:07,570
她富有感染力 对一切事物充满热情
She was infectious, enthusiastic,and excited about everything.

118
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:10,644
在我的记忆中
My memory of Mom is

119
00:07:11,747 --> 00:07:14,216
妈是个喜欢热闹的人
of someone who was very loud.

120
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,946
她走起路来动静很大 感觉地板会晃
She walked very heavily and made the records skip.

121
00:07:19,023 --> 00:07:22,015
大家都喜欢邀请她去派对
And my impression is she was a fun person at parties,

122
00:07:22,159 --> 00:07:24,752
同时她也是很适合捧人场的观众
that she was a fun person to have in an audience,

123
00:07:24,894 --> 00:07:26,361
因为她总是笑得特别大声
'cause she laughed loud.

124
00:07:27,798 --> 00:07:29,264
我觉得 如果你谈到黛安
You can't talk about Diane,I don't think,

125
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:31,369
就一定会谈到她的笑
without talking about her laugh.

126
00:07:31,503 --> 00:07:35,064
她所到之处的人都会被她的笑声感染
It infused every situation that she was in.

127
00:07:35,206 --> 00:07:39,335
她天生带着一股吸引人的欢快感
What attracted people to her was a sense of joy.

128
00:07:39,476 --> 00:07:41,570
我想她是个有感染力的人
She had a contagious personality,I thought,

129
00:07:41,713 --> 00:07:45,513
在我很小的时候 我喜欢看《我爱露西》
and when I was really young,I used to watch I Love Lucy,

130
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,585
当时我觉得露西就是妈妈演的
and I actually thought that was her,

131
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,880
因为她好笑 又做些很蠢的事
because she was fun and goofy.

132
00:07:50,022 --> 00:07:51,080
她让人感觉温暖
She was very warm.

133
00:07:51,223 --> 00:07:53,020
充满生命力
She was full of life

134
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:55,094
喜欢跳舞 喜欢派对
and loved to dance and loved to party

135
00:07:55,228 --> 00:07:56,386
经常笑
and laughing a lot,

136
00:07:56,528 --> 00:07:57,620
她还爱唱歌
and she loved to sing,

137
00:07:57,762 --> 00:08:00,163
唱得很难听 但她不介意
and she was the worst singer,but she didn't mind.

138
00:08:00,299 --> 00:08:01,790
她是个无忧无虑的人
She was sort of a good-time Charlie.

139
00:08:01,935 --> 00:08:05,371
她可以为你搭建避风港 让你和她一样快乐地活着
There's a big tent within which you can enjoy life with her.

140
00:08:05,505 --> 00:08:07,871
有一类人可以给周围的人幸福感
And there are people who just light up the life

141
00:08:08,008 --> 00:08:09,270
这就是她
for those people around her,

142
00:08:09,409 --> 00:08:12,468
有一类人就像火光吸引飞蛾一样吸引朋友
and people gravitate to them like a moth to flame.

143
00:08:12,611 --> 00:08:13,601
这也是她
And that was her.

144
00:08:13,747 --> 00:08:16,647
她还很勤奋 做了不少事
She also was very productive, got a lot of things done.

145
00:08:16,782 --> 00:08:18,342
她总是闲不下来
She was a very busy person

146
00:08:18,486 --> 00:08:20,579
想要做很多不同的事
and managed to juggle lots of different things.

147
00:08:20,722 --> 00:08:23,156
比如说 她很喜欢煲电话粥
I remember her being on the phone a lot, for example,

148
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,020
我还记得她很喜欢比手势说
and I remember the hand saying,

149
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:27,390
『别挂！嘘！别挂！』
"Hold on! Shh! Hold on!"

150
00:08:27,529 --> 00:08:29,927
每次我看见黛安
Whenever I would meet Diane,

151
00:08:30,063 --> 00:08:34,195
她都会出点什么状况
I always found that she was in trouble.

152
00:08:34,336 --> 00:08:37,066
比如说...她会落东西在出租车里
Something she'd done...she'd left something in a cab,

153
00:08:37,206 --> 00:08:38,969
或者她一来就说『你快跟我来』
or she'd arrive saying,"Oh, you have to come with me.

154
00:08:39,108 --> 00:08:40,700
『我得去什么什么地方 因为我干了什么什么事』
"I have to go there because I've done this,

155
00:08:40,843 --> 00:08:41,833
『我真是太蠢了』
"and it's so stupid,"

156
00:08:41,977 --> 00:08:44,172
走路的时候 她总是走在我前面
and as we were walking,she'd be ahead of me

157
00:08:44,313 --> 00:08:47,282
不停地跟我解释那些乱七八糟的事为什么会发生
trying to tell me why everything was in disarray.

158
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:49,907
所以每次我看见她 都会觉得
Whenever I would see her,it seemed as though...

159
00:08:51,254 --> 00:08:53,313
不好 又出状况了
something was going wrong.

160
00:08:53,456 --> 00:08:55,117
肯定是她干的
It was her fault,

161
00:08:55,259 --> 00:08:58,819
现在她在想法子解决那些麻烦
and she was trying to sort it out and correct it.

162
00:08:58,962 --> 00:09:03,626
我记得 妈当时是戏剧演员
As I understand it,Mom was doing plays,

163
00:09:03,767 --> 00:09:06,464
她在一次演出时认识了迈克尔
and she met Michael in one of those plays,

164
00:09:06,604 --> 00:09:08,629
一下就爱上了他
and she instantly fell in love with him.

165
00:09:08,772 --> 00:09:11,333
1965年 迈克尔在
In 1965, Michael played Mick

166
00:09:11,475 --> 00:09:14,377
《看管人》的北美首演上扮演米克
in The Caretaker's North American premiere.

167
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:15,979
他记得有位观众
He recalled an audience member

168
00:09:16,113 --> 00:09:18,046
在演出结束后来到化妆间
coming round to the dressing rooms later

169
00:09:18,181 --> 00:09:20,549
祝贺主演的演出成功
to congratulate the lead actor

170
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,982
然后他被介绍和她认识
and that he was introduced to her.

171
00:09:23,121 --> 00:09:24,748
那观众的名字就是黛安
Her name was Diane,

172
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:26,255
她特别喜欢这场演出
and she loved the show so much

173
00:09:26,391 --> 00:09:28,951
在那之后又去看了两次
that she came back twice more during the run.

174
00:09:29,094 --> 00:09:34,226
我觉得黛安爱上的不是我
I think Diane fell in love not with me,

175
00:09:34,367 --> 00:09:36,596
而是我在舞台上演出的角色
but with the character I was playing on stage.

176
00:09:36,735 --> 00:09:40,297
那个角色和我完全是不同的两类人
The character is something that is so different from me.

177
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,069
他很有激情 带着领导风范
It's such an exciting and dominating character.

178
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:46,611
你很难把目光从这个角色上移开
You can't take your eyes off that character.

179
00:09:46,747 --> 00:09:48,771
这绝对不是我
That's absolutely nothing like me at all,

180
00:09:48,915 --> 00:09:51,885
但这也是我想要扮演他的原因
but you can see why I would want to play it.

181
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:55,182
所以这件事听来是不是有些讽刺
So isn't it ironic that Diane turns up

182
00:09:55,322 --> 00:09:57,153
黛安来看一位演员的演出
to watch a performance by an actor,

183
00:09:57,291 --> 00:10:00,283
在演出的过程中 她不断想
and as she watches that performance, she sees,

184
00:10:00,428 --> 00:10:04,955
『这就是我一直在找的那个人』
"That person is exactly what I've been looking for all my life.

185
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,297
『他是那样富有激情 那样迷人』
"Somebody exciting,somebody full of intrigue.

186
00:10:08,436 --> 00:10:10,700
『这就是我一直要找的那个人』
"That"s what I've been looking for all my life. "

187
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:12,101
她自己也是位演员
She was an actress herself,

188
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,402
几个月后 他们一起合作了一部剧
and a few months later,they'd play together

189
00:10:14,543 --> 00:10:16,908
《劫火余生》
in The Condemned of Altona,

190
00:10:17,045 --> 00:10:19,412
他们的人生也就此无可追回地改变了
and that changed their lives irrevocably.

191
00:10:19,548 --> 00:10:22,346
黛安扮演那位女伶
Diane was playing the part of the actress,

192
00:10:22,485 --> 00:10:25,010
而我是德国军官
and me as the German officer.

193
00:10:25,154 --> 00:10:28,055
这又是一个充满魅力的角色
Once again,this is a fascinating character,

194
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:31,819
所以即便是在戏内 我们扮演的也是
so even in that play,we were playing two roles

195
00:10:31,961 --> 00:10:34,487
完全不同于自己的两个角色
rather than Michael and Diane.

196
00:10:34,631 --> 00:10:38,159
之后他们在一个派对聊上了
And they talked at a party afterwards,

197
00:10:38,302 --> 00:10:41,702
谈到了些微妙的事
and they got into some weird discussion

198
00:10:41,838 --> 00:10:43,965
爸提出开车送她回家
where Dad offered her a drive home,

199
00:10:44,107 --> 00:10:46,268
妈答应了
and Mom said okay.

200
00:10:46,409 --> 00:10:48,503
对 我确实说要开车送她回家
Yes, I did offer to drive her home.

201
00:10:48,646 --> 00:10:51,546
我说『我外面停着辆奔驰跑车』
I said, "I've got a Mercedes-Benz sports car

202
00:10:51,683 --> 00:10:57,979
『如果你想我可以送你回家』
"sitting outside if you want a ride home. "

203
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,749
爸承认当时外面并没有这么辆车
Dad admitted that he didn't have a car there.

204
00:10:56,888 --> 00:10:58,856
事实上 他当时根本没有开车
In fact, he didn't even drive.

205
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:01,186
外面停着的是妈的车
And Mom was the one that had a car there,

206
00:11:01,326 --> 00:11:03,259
所以在这个故事里
so somehow in the story,

207
00:11:03,394 --> 00:11:05,989
她们两个人在一起回家这件事上都说了谎
they're both lying to go home with each other.

208
00:11:06,131 --> 00:11:09,396
那之后 米克和黛安做了爱
And then they made love,Mick and Diane.

209
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:15,202
接下来 我想告诉你迈克尔在艺术之路上做过的另一次尝试
Let me continue by telling you another of Michael's artistic pursuits.

210
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,308
刚和黛安结婚的时候
At about the time of his marriage to Diane,

211
00:11:17,442 --> 00:11:19,809
迈克尔决定买一台电影摄像机
Michael decided to purchase a movie camera

212
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:22,608
记录下他们迟到的英国蜜月
and to record their belated honeymoon in England.

213
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:26,516
你可以从影像中看出他作品的几个特点
Watching it, several features of his work become apparent.

214
00:11:26,654 --> 00:11:30,384
在我用Super8摄影机拍摄的那些电影里
Every time you see a group of people in my Super 8 movies,

215
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,390
只要有人物出现 你可能就会很兴奋
every time you see a few people,you get interested,

216
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:34,516
因为镜头多数时间
the camera goes away

217
00:11:34,662 --> 00:11:36,788
都在拍房子的屋顶之类的东西
and looks at the roof of a house or something,

218
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:40,059
或者是镜头越拉越远 什么都不见了
or disappears in the distance.

219
00:11:40,202 --> 00:11:44,036
这是我的拍摄方式 不以人为主
This was my way of filming,not to include people too much.

220
00:11:44,172 --> 00:11:47,368
我记得黛安有次在提到那次旅行时说
I gather that Diane did once say that on that trip,

221
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:49,703
他拿着摄像机的时间
he spent more time gripping the camera

222
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:51,504
比抱着我的时间还多
than he did holding her.

223
00:12:00,323 --> 00:12:03,120
我一直觉得他们是截然不同的两类人
I had a feeling they were incredibly different people.

224
00:12:03,258 --> 00:12:06,091
看着他们结合我觉得很神奇
It was sort of amazing that they were together in some ways,

225
00:12:06,229 --> 00:12:08,060
因为他们真的大不相同
'cause they were so different.

226
00:12:08,197 --> 00:12:11,793
她多数时候都很容易激动
As excitable that she was most of the time,

227
00:12:11,935 --> 00:12:14,130
而他 至少看上去很冷静稳重
he was calm, or seemed to be.

228
00:12:14,271 --> 00:12:17,603
他内敛 矜持
He was centered and inside himself,

229
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,901
而她外放 直白
and she was so far outside of herself

230
00:12:20,042 --> 00:12:21,840
有时你会怀疑她是不是完全没有秘密
that sometimes there was nothing inside.

231
00:12:21,979 --> 00:12:23,843
迈克尔是个私人化的人
Michael was a private person,

232
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:27,850
而黛安绝对不是
and Diane was not a private person.

233
00:12:27,986 --> 00:12:30,352
她不会骗人
She really lacked guile.

234
00:12:30,488 --> 00:12:34,891
她不会人前一套人后一套
She did not have two faces for the world.

235
00:12:35,026 --> 00:12:37,892
不知道她会不会在不同的人面前表现出不同的样子
I don't know if she showed different faces to different people,

236
00:12:38,028 --> 00:12:41,056
但我总觉得她有很多秘密
but I did sense that she was a woman of secrets.

237
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,930
只是这些秘密被很好地隐藏了
But they were artfully hidden.

238
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:46,333
他们被藏在不起眼的地方
They were subtly hidden.

239
00:12:46,472 --> 00:12:50,635
因为她的人格魅力十分巨大
And because she had a larger-than-life personality,

240
00:12:50,775 --> 00:12:52,937
那些细微之处也自然被我们忽略了
you didn't look for the subtleties,

241
00:12:53,078 --> 00:12:55,638
就像一出巨大的障眼法
because there was the razzle-dazzle in front of you.

242
00:12:56,749 --> 00:12:58,115
她的其中一种...
One of her great...

243
00:13:00,387 --> 00:13:03,550
伟大的力量 应该是她的活力
strengths, I think, was her vitality,

244
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:09,059
她坚持把生活过到最充实的状态
her constant determination to live life to its fullest.

245
00:13:09,194 --> 00:13:12,131
我的性格里没有这样的东西
I don't have anything like that in my character whatsoever.

246
00:13:12,266 --> 00:13:14,826
我可以演出这样的角色
I love to play it as an act,

247
00:13:14,969 --> 00:13:17,699
但我做不到像这样生活
but I can't live it as a human being.

248
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:21,400
你能想象我一大早就像黛安那样跳下床
The idea of me jumping out of bed in the mornings,

249
00:13:21,543 --> 00:13:23,907
跑来跑去忙个不停么
running around and doing things like Diane used to do?

250
00:13:24,044 --> 00:13:26,947
黛安通常一次做十件事
Diane was usually doing ten things at the same time.

251
00:13:27,082 --> 00:13:29,481
而我一次做半件事
I'd be doing half of one thing.

252
00:13:29,617 --> 00:13:32,781
黛安迷恋他的头脑
Diane was so attracted to his mind,

253
00:13:32,921 --> 00:13:38,086
但她也希望他能更直白地向她吐露爱意
but she yearned for more demonstrative affection from him.

254
00:13:38,226 --> 00:13:40,091
爸说过...
Dad says that Mom

255
00:13:40,228 --> 00:13:42,355
老妈总是比他还想做爱
wanted to have sex a lot more than he did.

256
00:13:43,098 --> 00:13:46,591
当我问他细节 比如口交次数的时候
When I ask him specific questions,like about oral sex,

257
00:13:46,736 --> 00:13:48,728
爸和我说
Dad tells me that that is something

258
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:53,605
他们好像基本没有做过这个
that was thought of as something they did in France.

259
00:13:54,878 --> 00:13:57,846
我从没认为我爸是个严肃的人
I sure have never thought of my Dad as a prude.

260
00:13:57,981 --> 00:13:59,107
你什么都可以和他谈
He will talk about anything,

261
00:13:59,249 --> 00:14:01,683
他不会为任何事感到震惊
and he is not shocked by anything,

262
00:14:01,819 --> 00:14:05,516
不过一想到...
but it's kind of amazing to think that

263
00:14:05,656 --> 00:14:07,557
口交居然是...
oral sex was something that...

264
00:14:07,692 --> 00:14:08,919
也许是 我也不清楚
maybe it was, I don't know...

265
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:11,653
但一想到...
but it's amazing to think that...

266
00:14:13,331 --> 00:14:15,265
他不喜欢口交这事
that that was something that was so

267
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,461
我就对他肃然起敬
off the radar for him.

268
00:14:20,338 --> 00:14:26,107
我觉得 在你和我相处十二年后
I used to think a night with a dead wombat

269
00:14:26,245 --> 00:14:28,076
可能就会觉得和袋熊过一晚上
might turn out to be more exciting

270
00:14:28,214 --> 00:14:31,342
会比和我过一晚上来得更有意思
than a night with me after you've been with me for twelve years.

271
00:14:32,118 --> 00:14:34,609
所以...谁知道呢？
So... who knows?

272
00:14:35,921 --> 00:14:39,413
我是个好丈夫 就养家而言
I was a good husband, I think,in a providing way,

273
00:14:39,558 --> 00:14:43,585
大部分家用都是我挣的
in terms of my contribution to the household-running.

274
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:46,824
你能把丈夫一般要尽到的责任列张表
Could you give me a list of the duties of the average husband,

275
00:14:46,967 --> 00:14:49,231
让我清查下自己哪里做得不好么
so I could do a check-off?

276
00:14:49,369 --> 00:14:51,667
打扫和煮饭都是她包下的
She did all the cooking, all the cleaning,

277
00:14:51,805 --> 00:14:52,794
照顾孩子的也是她
all the taking care of the kids.

278
00:14:52,939 --> 00:14:54,874
一开始他完全不管我们
He didn't take any responsibility for us,

279
00:14:55,009 --> 00:14:56,270
他不帮我们做决定
he didn't make decisions about us.

280
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:58,071
总是说『问你妈去』
It was always,"Ask your mother. "

281
00:14:58,211 --> 00:14:59,703
后来他才意识到 自己有孩子了
Next thing he knew,he had kids,

282
00:14:59,848 --> 00:15:01,906
他觉得自己要尽到父亲的责任
and he thought that he had to be responsible.

283
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:04,074
于是他放弃了表演事业
So he gave up acting and started working

284
00:15:04,218 --> 00:15:07,415
去了人寿保险公司上班
at Manufacturers Life Insurance Company.

285
00:15:07,555 --> 00:15:09,955
妈对迈克尔做的这个决定感到十分沮丧
Mom was frustrated by Michael.

286
00:15:10,091 --> 00:15:12,617
她一直认为他是个才华横溢的男人
She saw Michael as an extremely talented man,

287
00:15:12,761 --> 00:15:15,628
一个才华横溢的作家 一个才华横溢的演员 歌手...
a talented writer,a very talented actor, singer...

288
00:15:15,764 --> 00:15:17,095
那才是他应该做的
he was all those things.

289
00:15:17,233 --> 00:15:18,563
我觉得她当时想的是
I think in her mind it was,

290
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,691
『我不是个有天赋的人』
"Look at how hard I have worked

291
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:23,634
『但我还是努力追求向往的事业』
"with very little God-given talent,

292
00:15:23,772 --> 00:15:24,966
『再看看这个男人』
"and look at this man,

293
00:15:25,107 --> 00:15:27,474
『上帝给了他出众的才能』
"who is so talented in so many ways,

294
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:29,270
『他却想将它舍弃』
"and he's throwing it away. "

295
00:15:29,411 --> 00:15:33,577
他写作很好 但他没有走上写作的路
He was a good writer,but he didn't pursue it.

296
00:15:33,716 --> 00:15:35,809
我们都鼓励过他
And we all encouraged him.

297
00:15:35,952 --> 00:15:38,250
但他就是不愿意
He just didn't.

298
00:15:38,388 --> 00:15:39,685
她对他感到很失望
She got frustrated with him,

299
00:15:39,823 --> 00:15:42,291
因为他觉得他很有才
because she felt that he was enormously talented

300
00:15:42,425 --> 00:15:45,863
他不该只为黛安和一家人
and was too willing to just do things

301
00:15:45,997 --> 00:15:49,831
默默地付出 他有权过更光彩的生活
for the small audience of he and Diane and the family.

302
00:15:50,568 --> 00:15:53,264
因为她太了解他
And while she knew him so well,

303
00:15:53,404 --> 00:15:56,032
所以她喜欢他陪在她身边
she just so enjoyed his company.

304
00:15:56,173 --> 00:15:58,038
我觉得这是女人的天职 对吧
And I think as women,we do that, right?

305
00:15:58,175 --> 00:16:00,508
我们选择我们爱的那个人
It's that we choose the person we are in love with,

306
00:16:00,645 --> 00:16:02,670
有时是那个人选择了我们
or sometimes it chooses us,

307
00:16:02,814 --> 00:16:04,783
然后我们就把余生托付给他
and then there's the rest of life.

308
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:13,381
1978年的某一天 她对我说
In 1978, she came to me one day and she said,

309
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,757
『我拿到了戏剧《多伦多》的一个角色』
"I've been offered a part in a play called Toronto,

310
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:21,459
『剧组要来蒙特利尔表演』
"which is going to take place in Montreal. "

311
00:16:21,602 --> 00:16:23,364
他问我『你觉得如何』
And she said to me,"What do you think?

312
00:16:23,503 --> 00:16:27,099
『介意我去蒙特利尔待几个月么』
"Would you mind if I went off to Montreal for a couple of months?

313
00:16:27,241 --> 00:16:29,333
『我不在家的时候照顾好孩子可以么？』
"Could you look after the kids while I'm gone?"

314
00:16:29,475 --> 00:16:31,500
事实上 他对此事完全没有意见
In truth,he was more than agreeable.

315
00:16:32,447 --> 00:16:33,744
他很开心
He was delighted.

316
00:16:35,582 --> 00:16:38,643
就像多数婚姻那样
Like many marriages,perhaps most,

317
00:16:38,786 --> 00:16:40,844
他们已经走到了七年之痒
this one had grown stale.

318
00:16:40,989 --> 00:16:44,082
早些年的热情已经消退
The passion of the early year or two had long died.

319
00:16:44,224 --> 00:16:46,591
他们要直面彼此生活方式上的不同
Their lifestyles were totally different.

320
00:16:46,728 --> 00:16:50,358
黛安热爱派对 迈克尔则喜欢独处
Diane loved parties,Michael solitude.

321
00:16:50,499 --> 00:16:53,059
迈克尔喜欢孤独 会一个人静静听音乐
Michael loved being alone and listening to music,

322
00:16:53,736 --> 00:16:55,635
黛安则会忍不住跳舞
Diane danced to it.

323
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:59,730
她常抱怨他对她太过冷淡
She'd often complained of his coldness towards her,

324
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,308
不单指床事
and not just in the marriage bed,

325
00:17:01,443 --> 00:17:03,638
还有他们相处的整个过程
but in all their time together.

326
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:05,611
他知道他让她失望了
He knew he disappointed her,

327
00:17:05,749 --> 00:17:10,652
他不是她当年眼中看见的那个米克和弗兰兹
that he had never lived up to her earlier vision of Mick and Franz,

328
00:17:10,787 --> 00:17:12,276
他知道自己永远不会成为那样的人
and he knew he never could.

329
00:17:13,155 --> 00:17:14,555
爸 刚才那句 你可以重念一次么
Dad, can you just take that line back?

330
00:17:14,691 --> 00:17:16,021
好吧
Yeah.

331
00:17:16,158 --> 00:17:19,493
一点点小错误你们都能听出来是吧
You guys pick up all these little mistakes, don't you?

332
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:20,858
他知道他让她失望了
He knew he'd disappointed her,

333
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:21,987
他不是
that he had never lived up

334
00:17:22,133 --> 00:17:25,364
她当年眼中看见的那个米克和弗兰兹
to her earlier visions of Mick and Franz,

335
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,232
他知道自己永远不会成为那样的人
and he knew he never could.

336
00:17:27,371 --> 00:17:29,770
所以当黛安说自己可能
So when Diane mentioned the possibility of acting

337
00:17:29,906 --> 00:17:32,535
要在蒙特利尔演出六七周的时候
for six or seven weeks in Montreal,

338
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:38,275
迈克尔内心狂喜 热情地鼓励了她
Michael was quietly ecstatic and openly enthusiastic.

339
00:17:38,417 --> 00:17:40,112
去蒙特利尔演出
Part of going to Montreal and doing the play

340
00:17:40,252 --> 00:17:42,516
对他而言也是避开她生活的一次休息
was get out of her life.

341
00:17:42,654 --> 00:17:44,053
她不喜欢住在多伦多
She hated living in Toronto.

342
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:46,817
她喜欢蒙特利尔 或者其它什么地方
She wanted to live in Montreal or somewhere else.

343
00:17:46,959 --> 00:17:49,291
因为她觉得多伦多是座保守的城市
She always thought Toronto was such a reserved city,

344
00:17:49,428 --> 00:17:52,330
每个人都把工作看成信条
and everybody was so work ethic.

345
00:17:52,465 --> 00:17:55,263
工作成了生活的全部意义而非赖以为生的手段
People lived to work,instead of worked to live,

346
00:17:55,401 --> 00:17:57,494
与之相比蒙特利尔似乎要好得多
which has always been more of the Montreal kind of thing,

347
00:17:57,637 --> 00:18:00,630
所以这对她来说也是逃离的一种手段
so it was a way of her getting away from that

348
00:18:00,774 --> 00:18:03,570
她可以继续做她想做的事 在舞台上表演
and doing what she really wanted to do, which was stage.

349
00:18:26,835 --> 00:18:28,133
可以和我们讲讲
Can you talk about the play

350
00:18:29,337 --> 00:18:31,202
你们在蒙特利尔一起演出的那部剧么
that you were in together in Montreal?

351
00:18:31,339 --> 00:18:33,308
是关于什么的
Can you describe what it was about?

352
00:18:33,442 --> 00:18:34,635
是一部叫《多伦多》的剧
It was a play called Toronto,

353
00:18:34,776 --> 00:18:36,710
关于一群试镜者的故事
and it was about a bunch of people auditioning.

354
00:18:36,845 --> 00:18:38,108
我不记得...
I can't remember the...

355
00:18:38,247 --> 00:18:41,114
我不记得她
I can't remember what she did...

356
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:43,142
在这里演的是什么了
in this play.

357
00:18:43,285 --> 00:18:46,083
我不记得剧情了
It was about as unmemorable as they get.

358
00:18:46,222 --> 00:18:48,350
好像是一个有名的剧作家
The guy had written a lot of great plays,

359
00:18:48,492 --> 00:18:50,458
然后他为了钱写了一部新剧
and I guess he needed some money.

360
00:18:50,592 --> 00:18:52,494
他写的是他在戏剧界的
He was writing about his experiences

361
00:18:52,629 --> 00:18:53,618
亲身经历
in the theater world.

362
00:18:53,764 --> 00:18:56,597
我扮演他新作品的导演
I played the director of his new play,

363
00:18:56,733 --> 00:18:59,702
韦恩・罗伯森和杰弗里・博斯
and Wayne Robson and Geoffrey Bowes

364
00:18:59,836 --> 00:19:01,930
扮演两位来试镜的演员
played actors who came in to audition.

365
00:19:02,073 --> 00:19:04,336
黛安扮演一位剧评人
And Diane played a reviewer.

366
00:19:04,474 --> 00:19:06,500
我对她说『黛安 你就像一个...』
I said, "Diane, you're like a kid

367
00:19:06,644 --> 00:19:09,942
『下课铃响就冲出教室的孩子 嘴里喊着“耶！”』
running out the door for recess,"going, "Yay!"

368
00:19:10,081 --> 00:19:11,070
她当时就是这样
And that's what she was like.

369
00:19:11,215 --> 00:19:14,412
这应该是她时隔多年又一次一个人巡演
It was her first time on the road on her own for a long time,

370
00:19:14,552 --> 00:19:16,179
她非常享受这种久违的自由
and she just savored all of it...

371
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,947
她走进化妆间 走到台前
in the dressing room, on stage,

372
00:19:18,089 --> 00:19:19,317
再走到台下
and then going out afterwards.

373
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,426
她跟我说『你来找我玩呀』
She said,"Come down and have a visit

374
00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:23,593
『来看我的演出吧』
"and come and see the play. "

375
00:19:23,728 --> 00:19:26,562
在我和她相处的时候 我记得最有趣的是
During the time that I was there,what was interesting,

376
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:29,463
她不停地谈论迈克尔
I remember her talking about Michael a lot,

377
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:32,900
因为迈克尔一直写情书给她
because Michael was writing her passionate letters.

378
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:35,700
然后 你也知道黛安的性格 她把信读给我听
And, being Diane,she read some of it to me,

379
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,038
我说 『黛安 这是你的隐私』
and I'm going,"Diane, this is private. "

380
00:19:38,179 --> 00:19:39,668
但黛安就是这种人
But the thing about Diane is that

381
00:19:39,813 --> 00:19:42,873
当下发生了什么事
what was happening in her life at the moment

382
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:44,347
她就会毫不避讳地与你谈论什么事
was what she talked about.

383
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:47,977
她和你说话的时候 你可以感觉到她的毫无保留
As she talked,it felt like this was everything,

384
00:19:48,122 --> 00:19:49,748
仿佛是教堂的告解一样
that it was totally confessional,

385
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:52,620
你觉得你可以看见她生活的全部
and that you were hearing the full story of her life.

386
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,819
但我现在意识到 那只是她生活的一部分
But I realize now,it must have been a part.

387
00:19:55,962 --> 00:19:58,363
她确实是个藏着秘密的人
So what I'm saying is that she had secrets.

388
00:20:00,468 --> 00:20:04,302
排练进行到第二周时 迈克尔来探班
Michael visited her after the second rehearsal week

389
00:20:04,438 --> 00:20:06,031
发现她比前些年
and found her more alive and happy

390
00:20:06,174 --> 00:20:08,233
还要来得快乐
than she had been for many years.

391
00:20:09,578 --> 00:20:11,137
他和她共处了两个晚上
He stayed with her two nights,

392
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,576
他们又开始做爱了
and they made love again

393
00:20:12,714 --> 00:20:15,616
倾泻着因短暂分离而赎回的激情
with all the passion that separation often brings.

394
00:20:16,384 --> 00:20:18,215
生活仿佛翻开了崭新的一页
Life was beginning again.

395
00:20:19,721 --> 00:20:22,588
你明白的 这些只不过是幻觉
You know all about it,and you know it's a delusion.

396
00:20:23,425 --> 00:20:26,624
就像小时候看的魔术 大人总会告诉你那是镜子制造的幻象
"It's all done with mirrors, mate,"they used to tell me.

397
00:20:27,998 --> 00:20:29,555
是的 镜子
Yes, the mirrors.

398
00:20:30,399 --> 00:20:33,197
一面能让你清楚看见自己的镜子
The mirrors in which you can see yourself clearly...

399
00:20:34,905 --> 00:20:36,371
一面能让你看见
the mirrors through which you can see

400
00:20:36,506 --> 00:20:38,133
内心深处的镜子
what you really look like.

401
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:51,512
黛安回到了迈克尔和多伦多的怀抱
Diane came back to her Toronto and Michael

402
00:20:52,222 --> 00:20:55,193
重新和助手约翰尼一起
and went back full time into her casting business

403
00:20:55,327 --> 00:20:57,157
做起了选角导演的工作
with Johnny as her assistant.

404
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:00,330
她和迈克尔的关系
Her relationship,on a sexual level at least,

405
00:21:00,466 --> 00:21:03,559
至少在性欲方面迎来了新的春天
with Michael was really blooming again,

406
00:21:03,701 --> 00:21:05,328
在分离一段时间之后
and after the long separation,

407
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:07,496
他们仿佛变回了新婚夫妻
they were almost like newlyweds.

408
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:11,340
几周后 她去看了医生
A few weeks later, she saw her doctor,

409
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,469
得知自己怀孕的消息
who confirmed her pregnancy.

410
00:21:14,181 --> 00:21:15,705
她回家把这件事告诉迈克尔的时候
When she came home to tell Michael,

411
00:21:15,849 --> 00:21:17,577
心里相当不安
she was clearly upset.

412
00:21:17,716 --> 00:21:19,047
『我和医生谈过了』
"I've talked to the doctor,

413
00:21:19,185 --> 00:21:22,814
『他说我这个年龄再生孩子可能有点危险』
"and the doctor says it's a bit dangerous because of my age. "

414
00:21:22,955 --> 00:21:24,684
我说『那你打算怎么办』
I said,"So what are you going to do?"

415
00:21:24,824 --> 00:21:29,024
她说『我正考虑去做人工流产』
And she said, "I think I should seriously consider having an abortion. "

416
00:21:29,763 --> 00:21:32,631
我说『如果你想做掉的话』
I said, "If that's the way you feel about it,

417
00:21:33,701 --> 00:21:34,690
『我也不说什么』
"that's okay with me.

418
00:21:34,836 --> 00:21:35,767
『你做决定』
"This is your decision.

419
00:21:35,902 --> 00:21:37,301
『那是你的身体 不是我的』
"It's your body, not mine. "

420
00:21:37,437 --> 00:21:41,432
黛安说她觉得自己该把这孩子打掉
Diane said that she felt she should have the baby aborted,

421
00:21:41,577 --> 00:21:44,273
因为他们可能也养不起更多孩子了
as they could scarcely afford another.

422
00:21:44,413 --> 00:21:47,075
他有些失望 因为他很喜欢孩子
He was disappointed,because he did love children...

423
00:21:47,216 --> 00:21:48,741
更别说是自己的孩子了
his in particular...

424
00:21:48,885 --> 00:21:51,147
但他对于流产一事也没有提出反对
but he went along with the abortion idea.

425
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,380
黛安的哥哥 鲍勃 是位医生
Diane's brother, Bob,was a doctor.

426
00:21:54,523 --> 00:21:58,392
我还记得当时我在办公室
I do recall being at the office

427
00:21:58,528 --> 00:22:00,393
她打电话给我
when I got a call from her.

428
00:22:01,431 --> 00:22:02,830
声音听起来很焦急
She was quite desperate,

429
00:22:02,966 --> 00:22:07,026
她说她怀孕了 可自己今年已经42岁了
because she was about 42 and said that she was pregnant,

430
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:08,660
这孩子是个意外
that it wasn't planned,

431
00:22:08,805 --> 00:22:12,138
她担心孩子会有唐氏综合症
that she was desperately worried about Down syndrome.

432
00:22:12,276 --> 00:22:14,267
当时的我 我想
And at the time I was, I think,

433
00:22:14,411 --> 00:22:18,541
是把一个生命看得比病人的选择更重要的
a bit more pro-life than pro-choice,

434
00:22:18,682 --> 00:22:20,115
所以你妈妈打来电话的时候
so when your mother called,

435
00:22:20,251 --> 00:22:21,810
我说服了她
I believe that I steered her

436
00:22:21,953 --> 00:22:23,816
让她把孩子留下来
towards proceeding with the pregnancy.

437
00:22:23,953 --> 00:22:26,980
黛安本来都在医院预约好了人流手术
Diane did arrange to go to the hospital for an abortion,

438
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:29,282
在往手术室走的时候
and we were actually on the way down

439
00:22:29,426 --> 00:22:30,917
她改变了主意
when she changed her mind.

440
00:22:31,062 --> 00:22:33,826
她突然说『我不能这样』
She suddenly said,"I can't go ahead with this. "

441
00:22:35,434 --> 00:22:36,695
很神奇 是不是
Amazing, isn't it?

442
00:22:36,835 --> 00:22:41,431
我是说 你差一点就不会出生在这个世界上了
I mean, how close we were to you never existing.

443
00:22:44,443 --> 00:22:47,310
但是这一点就足以让你反对人工流产了吧
It's almost enough to make you a anti-abortionist, isn't it?

444
00:22:51,017 --> 00:22:55,045
她当时很兴奋 因为一个新生命要降生了
She seemed excited,"cause it was something new.

445
00:22:55,722 --> 00:22:57,950
她喜欢一切『新』的东西 你明白吧
She just loved new, you know?

446
00:22:58,089 --> 00:23:00,082
『新』是她的追求
New was what she was all about.

447
00:23:00,227 --> 00:23:02,127
如果 我说如果
If there's such a thing as,

448
00:23:02,262 --> 00:23:05,789
灵魂有老旧与年轻之别的话
in that spiritual sense,old souls and young souls,

449
00:23:05,933 --> 00:23:08,562
她的身体里一定居住着一个年轻的灵魂
she was a really young soul,I would say.

450
00:23:09,369 --> 00:23:13,362
我不觉得你妈妈对怀上你这件事感到高兴
I don't think your mother was elated that she was pregnant.

451
00:23:13,507 --> 00:23:14,668
我不觉得
I do not think so.

452
00:23:14,809 --> 00:23:16,275
真的 我真的不觉得是这样
No, I do not think so.

453
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:19,107
真的 真的
I do not. I do not.

454
00:23:21,416 --> 00:23:23,145
在萨拉出生之后
After Sarah's birth,

455
00:23:23,284 --> 00:23:25,445
黛安和迈克尔没再同台演出过
Diane and Michael did not act together again

456
00:23:25,586 --> 00:23:29,544
直到菲利普的《菲洛米娜》被搬上舞台
until the play Filumena by Eduardo de Filippo.

457
00:23:29,691 --> 00:23:31,887
黛安扮演菲洛米娜
Diane was to play the title role

458
00:23:32,027 --> 00:23:33,551
迈克尔扮演她的丈夫
with Michael as the husband.

459
00:23:33,696 --> 00:23:36,688
选角的人里有人看过他们两人在《劫火余生》里的表演
Someone had seen them together in The Condemned of Altona

460
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,959
因此决定让他们再一次以恋人的身份
and had decided it would be nice to see them together

461
00:23:39,101 --> 00:23:41,002
站上舞台
on stage once more.

462
00:23:41,137 --> 00:23:42,899
这是一次善意的安排
It was a fine gesture,

463
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:45,234
他们也很高兴能出演这部作品
and they were delighted to do the piece.

464
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:48,708
《菲洛米娜》这部剧
Filumena was the play

465
00:23:48,845 --> 00:23:51,006
便是电影《意大利式结婚》的前身
that became the movie Marriage Italian Style

466
00:23:51,147 --> 00:23:55,050
马塞洛・马斯楚安尼和索菲亚・罗兰是电影的男女主角
with Marcello Mastroianni and Sophia Loren.

467
00:23:55,186 --> 00:23:58,211
这是一个相当吸引人的故事 这两个人生活在一起
It's a fascinating story,because they've lived together,

468
00:23:58,355 --> 00:24:00,518
她希望他能娶她
and she wants him to marry her.

469
00:24:10,634 --> 00:24:11,794
告诉我
Tell me.

470
00:24:15,007 --> 00:24:17,942
她 扮演的索菲亚・罗兰的角色 曾是个妓女
She, the Sophia Loren part,has been a prostitute,

471
00:24:18,076 --> 00:24:20,442
在那段时间里
and somehow over that period of time,

472
00:24:20,579 --> 00:24:21,978
他生下了三个男孩
she has had three sons.

473
00:24:22,114 --> 00:24:24,344
他完全不知道他有三个儿子的事
He doesn't even know she has three sons.

474
00:24:24,483 --> 00:24:25,609
而她是这么说的
And she says to him,

475
00:24:25,751 --> 00:24:28,243
『我要你给我的孩子一个名分』
"I need to get you to legitimize my children.

476
00:24:28,388 --> 00:24:29,376
『你愿意娶我么？』
"Will you marry me?"

477
00:24:29,521 --> 00:24:31,045
他说『我为什么要娶你？』
And he says,"Why would I marry you?"

478
00:24:31,189 --> 00:24:32,453
她说『因为其中一个孩子是你的』
And she says...

479
00:24:39,832 --> 00:24:41,164
『噢』
"Oh. "

480
00:24:41,301 --> 00:24:45,236
多米尼克试图确认哪一个孩子是他的骨肉
Domenico tries to find out which of the lads is his,

481
00:24:45,371 --> 00:24:47,068
但他最终失败了
but he totally fails,

482
00:24:47,208 --> 00:24:50,005
每个孩子与他都有着某些相似之处
since each is like him in some ways

483
00:24:50,145 --> 00:24:52,237
而彼此又全然不同
and completely different in others.

484
00:24:52,379 --> 00:24:55,372
在绝望中 多米尼克娶了菲洛米娜
In desperation,Domenico marries Filumena

485
00:24:55,517 --> 00:24:58,713
这样他的儿子才能拥有一个属于自己的家
so that his true son can have the family he needs

486
00:24:58,852 --> 00:25:01,720
也能延续自己的血脉
and a future that one of his blood deserves.

487
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:05,658
菲洛米娜的最后一句话是
Filumena's final words are,

488
00:25:06,695 --> 00:25:10,960
『孩子只是孩子 他们都是平等的』
"Children are children,and they are all equal. "

489
00:25:15,438 --> 00:25:19,535
就这样 黛安和迈克尔最后的演出谢幕了
And so Diane and Michael played out their final act together,

490
00:25:19,676 --> 00:25:23,077
尽管他们当时都不知道 这是他们最后一次合作
though not knowing that it was just that.

491
00:25:23,212 --> 00:25:25,339
当时有人知道她要死了么？
Did anyone know she was going to die?

492
00:25:26,082 --> 00:25:27,071
我们都知道
Yeah, we all knew.

493
00:25:28,752 --> 00:25:30,446
等等 你的意思是...
Did anyone know she was gonna die?

494
00:25:31,554 --> 00:25:33,022
她知道自己得了癌症的时候？
When she had cancer?

495
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:35,148
知道啊 你不知道么
Yeah. Did you know?

496
00:25:36,393 --> 00:25:37,656
对 当时你还不知道
No, you didn't know.

497
00:25:37,795 --> 00:25:39,728
她当时心乱如麻
She was just a mess.

498
00:25:39,863 --> 00:25:41,889
她非常 非常 非常害怕
She was very,very, very frightened.

499
00:25:42,033 --> 00:25:44,057
她的所有活力
With so much energy,all of her energy

500
00:25:44,201 --> 00:25:48,468
都转化成了对未知的恐惧和难过
was going into her uncertainty and her fear and unhappiness.

501
00:25:48,606 --> 00:25:50,802
当我拥抱她的时候 那感觉就像是握着...
And when I hugged her, it was like holding a...

502
00:25:50,943 --> 00:25:54,003
不知道你有没有用手抓住过一只小鸟
I don't know if you ever have held a bird in your hand,

503
00:25:54,146 --> 00:25:57,273
你能感觉到它的恐惧 感觉到它在你手中的心跳
the way it's terrified and you just feel its heartbeat.

504
00:25:57,415 --> 00:25:59,042
你明白我的意思吗？
Do you know what I mean?

505
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:00,947
她整个人都在颤抖
She was just shaking.

506
00:26:01,086 --> 00:26:03,713
你觉得她当时知道自己快死了么
Did you get the sense that she knew she was dying?

507
00:26:04,523 --> 00:26:05,855
是
Yeah.

508
00:26:05,992 --> 00:26:07,823
她知道
Yeah, she knew.

509
00:26:08,895 --> 00:26:11,887
我不觉得黛安清楚地明白自己会死
I don't think Diane ever fully realized.

510
00:26:12,031 --> 00:26:13,759
我们从没谈论过这类话题
We never talked about any of the things,

511
00:26:13,899 --> 00:26:15,492
因为我们觉得这种事不会发生
because we didn't think it was gonna happen.

512
00:26:15,635 --> 00:26:17,898
当她做完最后一次手术回家之后
When she came out of that last operation,

513
00:26:18,036 --> 00:26:21,201
我某天回家 看到她在花园里
I came home one day and she was out in the driveway,

514
00:26:21,342 --> 00:26:22,603
拖着一张桌子
scraping down a table

515
00:26:22,742 --> 00:26:25,371
打算给它重新上漆
so that she could repaint it for the house.

516
00:26:27,448 --> 00:26:31,178
所以我觉得她真的没有去想这件事
So I think she didn't have any real sense.

517
00:26:31,317 --> 00:26:33,411
我冲她说『你到底..』
I said to her, "What on earth

518
00:26:33,554 --> 00:26:35,181
『为什么要到外头来整这张桌子』
"are you doing out here doing the table?"

519
00:26:35,323 --> 00:26:38,554
她说『我们得把这些桌子都抬出来』
And she said, "We got to get all these tables done.

520
00:26:38,693 --> 00:26:40,558
『这样才能重新上漆』
"Then we can have them all varnished

521
00:26:40,695 --> 00:26:42,595
『把它们变成一个颜色的』
"the same color and everything. "

522
00:26:43,598 --> 00:26:47,034
这根本不像是一个...
That's not a person who's, as it was, turned out,

523
00:26:47,169 --> 00:26:50,069
只剩下四到五周寿命的人
four or five weeks away from death.

524
00:26:50,204 --> 00:26:54,905
这分明就是一个还在关心屋子好不好看的主妇
That's a person who's still planning how the house is gonna look.

525
00:26:55,945 --> 00:26:58,607
随着癌症发展 她越来越容易累
As it progressed,she was more and more tired,

526
00:26:58,748 --> 00:27:01,240
治疗在她身上施加的压力也越来越重
and the treatments were harder and harder on her.

527
00:27:04,719 --> 00:27:07,053
她真的是拼死在抗争...
Man, she fought like crazy,you know.

528
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,803
是场很大的追悼会
It just seemed like a really big memorial service,

529
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:28,037
上台致辞的很多人
and I just remember a lot of the people that spoke

530
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:30,147
似乎都在加拿大小有名气
were Canadian sort of celebrity people,

531
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:33,045
他们有些不是和老妈很亲近的人
not necessarily the people that were closest to Mom in her life,

532
00:27:33,185 --> 00:27:35,709
不过我记得自己当时的感觉是
but I remember thinking as I was watching it,

533
00:27:35,853 --> 00:27:37,411
『这追悼会排场真大』
"Gee, it's a good memorial service,

534
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:39,319
另外我还觉得
and I think it's kind of nice

535
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:40,948
在娱乐圈里混有个好处
to be in show business when you die,

536
00:27:41,093 --> 00:27:43,994
就是来参加你追悼会的人都有一流的口才
because the people that speak are good at speaking.

537
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:45,596
她当年非常非常受欢迎
She was very, very popular,

538
00:27:45,731 --> 00:27:48,565
所以你可以想象很多人到场的画面
so, as you can imagine, there were many, many people there,

539
00:27:48,702 --> 00:27:52,467
但在我眼中这情景并不真实
but to me it was some kind of production.

540
00:27:52,606 --> 00:27:55,575
我觉得自己在看一出规模很大的戏
I felt like I was at a big play or something.

541
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:05,074
在我的记忆中 老妈去世以后
I think, in retrospect, after Mom died,

542
00:28:05,218 --> 00:28:07,345
爸变得非常消沉
Dad was depressed.

543
00:28:07,487 --> 00:28:10,719
他看上去似乎和平时一样理性
He seemed very rational about it,as he always does,

544
00:28:10,858 --> 00:28:14,316
但他开始一个人玩桥牌
but the whole thing about him playing solitaire all the time

545
00:28:14,462 --> 00:28:18,023
变得比平时更加孤僻
and being even more isolated than usual

546
00:28:18,165 --> 00:28:20,657
所有的这些都让我们觉得他崩溃了
all suggests that he just sort of shut down.

547
00:28:20,802 --> 00:28:23,325
我去看他的时候
I mean, going to visit him

548
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:27,875
他一个人在玩桥牌 完全没有停下来的意思
when he would be playing solitaire and wouldn't stop playing,

549
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:30,740
就好像他想把整个世界都隔绝在外
as if he just wanted to shut the world off.

550
00:28:30,879 --> 00:28:32,676
那种感觉很奇怪
It was very strange.

551
00:28:32,814 --> 00:28:35,648
就像你走进了一间
It was sort of like walking into a home

552
00:28:35,785 --> 00:28:41,314
年久失修 人气冷清的房子
of utter neglect and almost disuse.

553
00:28:41,457 --> 00:28:42,718
我还记得
And I remember Dad

554
00:28:44,794 --> 00:28:47,730
爸整天都在抽烟
just smoking all day.

555
00:28:47,865 --> 00:28:49,695
他会因为你没有给狗狗喂食
And I remember him being very angry and upset

556
00:28:49,832 --> 00:28:51,891
而火冒三丈
about you not taking care of the dog,

557
00:28:52,035 --> 00:28:54,004
真的很奇怪
which was a little bit weird,

558
00:28:54,138 --> 00:28:58,234
因为你当时也像是一个没人照顾的孩子
'cause you seemed like a little kid that nobody was taking care of.

559
00:28:59,677 --> 00:29:03,010
那件事对我的打击很大
It really knocked me out,

560
00:29:03,147 --> 00:29:05,342
而其他孩子都离开了家
and the other children had gone away.

561
00:29:05,482 --> 00:29:07,314
一转眼 家里就只剩下你和我了
Suddenly,there was just you and I left.

562
00:29:07,452 --> 00:29:09,612
我觉得自己很幸运 还有你可以照顾
Luckily, I had you there to look after

563
00:29:09,753 --> 00:29:11,723
也可以被你照顾
as well as to look after me.

564
00:29:11,857 --> 00:29:13,619
你当时几岁来着 11岁？
What were you, 11 then?

565
00:29:13,758 --> 00:29:17,455
在接下来的几年中 我们的关系变得非常...
The next few years,our relationship was a very, very...

566
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:20,365
非常好 那是我人生中最好的时光
a great period from my life.

567
00:29:20,499 --> 00:29:23,990
我们之间建立了非比寻常的友谊
It certainly was an unusual relationship, too,

568
00:29:24,135 --> 00:29:26,662
要知道这种事不常发生
in the sense it's not very often

569
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:28,365
一位父亲和他的小女儿
that a father and a daughter

570
00:29:28,508 --> 00:29:31,840
会因为环境使然而变得如此亲近
are so close because of circumstances.

571
00:29:31,977 --> 00:29:34,811
也是因为这样 比起你的哥哥姐姐
So in a way, I felt closer to you

572
00:29:34,948 --> 00:29:36,608
我感觉自己和你更亲近一些
than I'd ever felt about the other children,

573
00:29:36,749 --> 00:29:39,048
因为当年还有黛安陪在我身边
because there had always been Diane there as well.

574
00:29:39,753 --> 00:29:42,120
突然间 就只剩下我和一个小女孩了
Suddenly, there was myself and this little girl.

575
00:29:42,256 --> 00:29:46,555
我们就这样在一起过了四五年
There were four or five very close years we had together.

576
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,097
迈克尔还记得 在黛安去世后
Michael remembers a time or two after Diane had died

577
00:30:02,244 --> 00:30:04,268
孩子们有一两次在周日时回家
when the children would come up for a Sunday dinner

578
00:30:04,412 --> 00:30:06,175
与萨拉和他一同聚餐的情形
to join Sarah and him,

579
00:30:06,314 --> 00:30:09,442
他记得 某天有个人说
and he remembers how one day someone said that Sarah

580
00:30:09,584 --> 00:30:11,952
萨拉长得一点也不像她父亲
did not look at all like her father.

581
00:30:13,223 --> 00:30:16,818
让我们再次回到许多年前的某天
It's time to go back many years once more.

582
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,449
约翰尼正在客厅
Johnny was working in the living room

583
00:30:18,594 --> 00:30:20,221
做试镜的联系名单
on a list for a casting call,

584
00:30:20,362 --> 00:30:22,228
他的母亲独自一人呆在书房里
and his mother was alone in the den.

585
00:30:22,365 --> 00:30:25,698
他先是听见难过的说话声
Then he thought he heard something that sounded like distress

586
00:30:26,469 --> 00:30:30,338
于是便忍不住凑近了一点
and found himself being unable to resist moving a little closer.

587
00:30:30,474 --> 00:30:32,908
他在门外停住脚步 仔细地听着
He stopped, and he listened,

588
00:30:33,043 --> 00:30:35,705
毫无疑问 她正在哭泣
and there was no doubt that she was crying.

589
00:30:35,846 --> 00:30:39,907
我当时听见妈说她怀孕了
What I overheard was Mom saying that she was pregnant,

590
00:30:40,618 --> 00:30:43,086
在考虑把孩子做掉
and that she was considering an abortion,

591
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,849
而且她不确定孩子的父亲是谁
and that she wasn't sure who the father was.

592
00:30:49,061 --> 00:30:51,220
不管她在和谁打电话 我记得她谈论了
But I remember Mom,whoever she was talking on the phone,

593
00:30:51,362 --> 00:30:54,332
和迈克尔在蒙特利尔度过的难忘周末
talking about this big weekend that she and Michael had had

594
00:30:54,466 --> 00:30:57,161
他们的关系是如何得到了改善
and how it had reinvigorated the relationship,

595
00:30:57,301 --> 00:30:59,362
在蒙特利尔的那个周末以后
and he started to write her all these love letters

596
00:30:59,505 --> 00:31:01,370
他寄给她很多情书
after the weekend that they had in Montreal.

597
00:31:01,507 --> 00:31:04,271
但毫无疑问
It was clear that you had been conceived

598
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:06,275
妈是在蒙特利尔表演时怀上的你
while Mom was in Montreal.

599
00:31:06,412 --> 00:31:07,811
他又偷听了一会
He listened for a while longer

600
00:31:07,947 --> 00:31:11,473
带着惶恐不安的心情回到客厅 继续手头的工作
and then hurried guiltily back to his work in the living room.

601
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:14,849
他没有向人透露一个字 这件事就这么过去了
He said nothing,and so the event passed,

602
00:31:14,988 --> 00:31:17,479
约翰一直藏着这个秘密
and John kept it all to himself

603
00:31:17,624 --> 00:31:20,787
直到上一代的许多人都入了土
while an entire generation went to their graves.

604
00:31:20,928 --> 00:31:22,157
我想我刻意地遗忘了这件事
I guess I'd kind of blocked it.

605
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,762
我不再去想这件事
I guess I'd stopped thinking about it,

606
00:31:23,896 --> 00:31:26,388
因为我不知道这有什么意义
because what good is it going to do?

607
00:31:26,533 --> 00:31:29,264
我们家当时已经够乱了
The family was a big enough mess already.

608
00:31:29,403 --> 00:31:33,204
在妈去世了很多年之后
Years later,when I was in my 20s,

609
00:31:33,341 --> 00:31:35,070
大概在我二十几岁的时候
long after Mom had died,

610
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:39,908
安妮・提特提到了
Anne Tait mentioned something about somebody in Montreal

611
00:31:40,047 --> 00:31:42,482
妈妈在蒙特利尔演出时遇到的一个人
when Mom was in Montreal for that period of time.

612
00:31:42,617 --> 00:31:46,816
约翰尼有一次把我的话给套出来了
Johnny once led me into talking about that.

613
00:31:46,956 --> 00:31:50,949
关于这件事我口风还是看得挺紧的
Because I think I was quite tight-lipped about it.

614
00:31:51,093 --> 00:31:53,493
我当时认为 戏里的一个演员
I thought that this actor in the play

615
00:31:53,629 --> 00:31:56,222
可能是孩子的父亲
might have been the father.

616
00:31:56,364 --> 00:31:58,731
你的父亲 还是这样说比较好
Your father, let's say it.

617
00:31:58,868 --> 00:32:02,929
不然会让人觉得她是个不检点的女人
It makes it sound as if she was terribly promiscuous,

618
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:06,099
事实上 我觉得她并不是那样的人
which, in fact,I don't think she was.

619
00:32:06,243 --> 00:32:11,340
但我觉得她应该想到过这个可能性
But I think she did consider that it was possible

620
00:32:11,481 --> 00:32:13,210
这个男人可能是孩子的父亲
that it could be this other guy.

621
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:14,817
所以...
And so at some point...

622
00:32:14,951 --> 00:32:18,319
因为我们过去常在周末时一起吃饭
because we used to often have dinner together on weekends...

623
00:32:18,456 --> 00:32:21,050
应该是约翰尼先说的
probably Johnny started by saying,

624
00:32:21,192 --> 00:32:23,126
『你看起来一点也不像你父亲』
"You don't look much like your father. "

625
00:32:23,261 --> 00:32:24,489
我觉得是约翰尼
I think it was Johnny.

626
00:32:24,629 --> 00:32:25,994
我一直想说是约翰尼
I want to say it was Johnny.

627
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:28,224
而现在回想起来 约翰尼他
And now in retrospect that I know that Johnny

628
00:32:28,367 --> 00:32:30,890
应该是我们中第一个知道这事的
was the first of us who knew, it must have been Johnny.

629
00:32:31,035 --> 00:32:35,370
我当时很蠢地把这件事告诉了马克
I stupidly mentioned it to Mark,I thought.

630
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:42,441
我律师跟我说我不是非得回答你的问题
My lawyer has said I don't have to talk to you,

631
00:32:42,582 --> 00:32:45,914
那我就不往下说了吧
and so I'm not gonna say anything more.

632
00:32:46,051 --> 00:32:49,283
我记得约翰尼和我说
I remember Johnny saying

633
00:32:49,422 --> 00:32:52,255
有人觉得 你的亲生父亲可能是
that someone thought that your father

634
00:32:52,392 --> 00:32:54,884
和老妈一起演出的一个人
might be someone that Mom had acted with in a play.

635
00:32:55,029 --> 00:32:56,962
我跟他说千万别和别人说这事
I told him not to say anything to anyone,

636
00:32:57,096 --> 00:32:58,688
结果他们把这变成了一个笑话
but then they turned it into a joke.

637
00:32:59,633 --> 00:33:01,601
我不算是参与了那个笑话吧 算么
And I did not participate in the joke, did I?

638
00:33:01,734 --> 00:33:03,395
我不觉得
I don't think I ever did.

639
00:33:03,536 --> 00:33:05,801
我记得我们当时开玩笑说你长得不像老爸
I remember we talked about how you didn't look like Dad,

640
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,771
而老爸也拿这个开玩笑
and Dad joked about it.

641
00:33:07,908 --> 00:33:11,708
我当时想『她哪不像我了』
I always thought,"She does look like me.

642
00:33:11,845 --> 00:33:14,644
『那高鼻梁和我一模一样』
"Got that little straight nose.Yeah, definitely.

643
00:33:14,783 --> 00:33:17,114
『就是小孩子胡闹呢 不过还挺好玩的』
"This is all nonsense, but it's fun.

644
00:33:17,251 --> 00:33:19,277
『你觉得这个礼拜的爸爸是谁啊 萨拉？』
"Who do you think your father is this week, Sarah?"

645
00:33:20,255 --> 00:33:22,348
这个玩笑像滚雪球般越变越大
And the joke got bigger and bigger,

646
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:26,790
我们会把你和那三个演员一一比较
because we'd each compare you with one of these three actors.

647
00:33:26,928 --> 00:33:29,295
他们都认识这三个演员
They all knew of the three actors in question,

648
00:33:29,432 --> 00:33:31,126
会拿他们性格里
and had much fun with the characteristics

649
00:33:31,266 --> 00:33:33,964
和萨拉相同的部分开玩笑
that they had in common with Sarah.

650
00:33:34,104 --> 00:33:35,593
萨拉笑得很开心
Sarah laughed.

651
00:33:35,738 --> 00:33:36,762
大家都笑得很开心
They all laughed,

652
00:33:36,906 --> 00:33:40,205
这种比较逐渐成了固定的欢乐节目
and the comparisons became a recurring source of amusement.

653
00:33:40,343 --> 00:33:43,801
是汤姆 韦恩 还是杰弗呢？
Was it Tom or Wayne or Geoff?

654
00:33:44,513 --> 00:33:46,243
可以再念一次吗
If you could just take back that one line.

655
00:33:46,383 --> 00:33:52,117
行 是汤姆 韦恩 还是杰弗呢
Yeah.Was it Tom or Wayne or Geoff?

656
00:33:52,255 --> 00:33:54,780
你还记得你说的那个
Do you remember the name of the actor in the play

657
00:33:54,925 --> 00:33:56,654
可能是我父亲的演员的名字吗
that you thought might be my father?

658
00:33:56,793 --> 00:33:59,957
当然 当然记得啦
Yes. Of course,I remember his name.

659
00:34:00,098 --> 00:34:02,259
你要我说出来吗
Do you want me to talk about that?

660
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,924
如果你不介意的话
If you're comfortable.

661
00:34:04,068 --> 00:34:07,697
这应该要看他介不介意吧
Well, it depends on whether he's comfortable, I would think.

662
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,198
杰弗・博斯
It was Geoff Bowes.

663
00:34:10,341 --> 00:34:12,502
他们觉得是杰弗・博斯
The thinking was that it was Geoff Bowes.

664
00:34:12,644 --> 00:34:15,205
我记得 是个叫杰弗・博斯的演员
There was, I guess,an actor named Geoff Bowes.

665
00:34:15,347 --> 00:34:16,335
杰弗・博斯
Geoff Bowes.

666
00:34:21,254 --> 00:34:23,050
所以这部电影接下来都会这样么
That's what the film's gonna be like.

667
00:34:23,189 --> 00:34:24,177
杰弗・博斯
"Geoff Bowes. "

668
00:34:24,323 --> 00:34:25,517
杰弗・博斯
"Geoff Bowes. "

669
00:34:25,658 --> 00:34:29,788
约翰尼装出一副她曾经提到
Johnny pretended that she'd mentioned Geoff Bowes

670
00:34:29,928 --> 00:34:30,917
杰弗・博斯和外遇的样子
and an affair with him,

671
00:34:31,063 --> 00:34:35,434
于是我就说『哦 好吧 我跟你说吧』
and so I said,"Well, okay, I'll tell you.

672
00:34:35,569 --> 00:34:37,196
『她确实和我说过』
"Yes, she did tell me. "

673
00:34:37,338 --> 00:34:39,805
你现在还记得我刚才的话么
What do you remember me saying?

674
00:34:41,241 --> 00:34:44,699
我可是把自己都交到你手上了啊
I trust you more than I trust myself right now.

675
00:34:45,512 --> 00:34:48,676
于是我打开《名人面对面》
At that point, I opened Face to Face with Talent

676
00:34:48,816 --> 00:34:52,048
看着杰弗・博斯的照片 心想
and looked at Geoff Bowes' picture and thought,

677
00:34:52,187 --> 00:34:53,176
『哦 是啊 真的』
"Oh, yeah, for sure.

678
00:34:53,321 --> 00:34:54,379
『她真的好像他』
"Look how much she looks like him,

679
00:34:54,523 --> 00:34:56,116
『他个子不高 他是红发』
"and he's short,and he has red hair. "

680
00:34:56,257 --> 00:34:58,316
而你出生时头发就是淡红色的
And you were born with bright red hair.

681
00:34:58,459 --> 00:35:02,260
我猛地想起当时老妈非常在意
I instantly flashed back to Mom making a huge deal

682
00:35:02,397 --> 00:35:03,624
你是红头发这事
about you having red hair.

683
00:35:03,764 --> 00:35:05,130
这就和你撒谎的时候
It's like when you're lying about something,

684
00:35:05,267 --> 00:35:06,428
会不停地强调假话一样
you overplay it?

685
00:35:06,569 --> 00:35:08,298
她总是不停地说
She had gone on and on

686
00:35:08,438 --> 00:35:10,804
萨拉是红头发这事太奇怪了
about how weird it is that Sarah has red hair.

687
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,100
『太怪了！』
"It's so odd!

688
00:35:12,241 --> 00:35:15,176
『可能是我堂妹玛格丽特安妮是红发的关系吧』
"I guess my cousin Margaret-Anne has red hair. "

689
00:35:15,311 --> 00:35:16,538
这事突然就闪回到我的脑海中
And that struck me,

690
00:35:16,678 --> 00:35:17,975
接着我看见他一头红发的照片
and then I saw him with the red hair,

691
00:35:18,113 --> 00:35:19,513
所以我想...
and I really did think...

692
00:35:19,649 --> 00:35:21,277
我当时真的觉得这是真的
I really thought it was true.

693
00:35:22,885 --> 00:35:25,548
有时候 我真的开始相信那是真的
So at some point, I think I did start to believe it was true

694
00:35:25,689 --> 00:35:28,214
开始想是不是该有人把真相告诉你
and thought someone should say something to you.

695
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:31,349
我记得我们几个人凑在一起讨论过
I feel like we all had a discussion about it at some point,

696
00:35:31,494 --> 00:35:33,326
当然 不包括你
"we all" being everyone but you.

697
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,159
约翰尼说我是个大嘴巴
And I think Johnny said I had a big mouth

698
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:37,358
我可能会把这事告诉你
and that I was probably gonna tell you or something.

699
00:35:37,501 --> 00:35:39,493
我和他说『我觉得我们应该告诉她』
And I was saying,"I think we should tell her. "

700
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:42,837
现在 让我们把时间向前推进一点
Now, I think we should leap forward to a point

701
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,204
在黛安去世几年后
several years after Diane's death,

702
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:49,107
晚餐桌上的那个陈年笑话
when the jokes with her family round the dinner table

703
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:50,679
似乎也不再好笑了
were not so funny,

704
00:35:51,381 --> 00:35:52,543
当话题开始变得严肃
and since it went further

705
00:35:52,685 --> 00:35:54,778
而多伦多剧团里那个可能的父亲
and named the member of the cast of Toronto

706
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,081
身份正日渐明朗
who was her possible parent,

707
00:35:57,223 --> 00:36:00,818
她觉得是时候迈出关键一步了
she decided it was time to take the plunge.

708
00:36:00,961 --> 00:36:03,359
她打电话给杰弗 问他可不可以见面
She phoned Geoff and asked if they could meet.

709
00:36:04,963 --> 00:36:06,022
你打电话来...
You called...

710
00:36:07,399 --> 00:36:10,631
我们安排了见面
and we arranged to meet,

711
00:36:10,771 --> 00:36:13,638
你问我当年在蒙特利尔发生的事
and you wanted to know about that time in Montreal.

712
00:36:13,774 --> 00:36:15,743
我当时把手搭在你的肩上 心想
I remember putting my arm around you,and I thought,

713
00:36:15,877 --> 00:36:17,673
『哦 天啊 希望我没做得太过』
"Oh, boy, I hope that isn't too forward or something. "

714
00:36:17,811 --> 00:36:20,974
我开始想起你问我的那些事
And I remember recounting some of the same tales.

715
00:36:21,114 --> 00:36:23,446
那些我遗忘了很久的关于黛安的事
I hadn't really thought about Diane for a long time,

716
00:36:23,583 --> 00:36:26,314
我当时心里挺难过的
so I recall being pretty sad.

717
00:36:27,121 --> 00:36:30,682
从我18岁起 就总有人说
So, since I was 18, there was this rumor

718
00:36:30,825 --> 00:36:32,952
你是我的亲生父亲
that you were my biological father.

719
00:36:34,695 --> 00:36:35,992
这事听起来是不是很奇怪
It's been this bizarre thing.

720
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:39,498
我总在想 到底是从什么地方传开的
It's like, how that rumor began,where did it come from?

721
00:36:39,635 --> 00:36:41,193
所以我就想问你一下
And I just wanted to ask you about that.

722
00:36:41,336 --> 00:36:44,305
你和我妈在交往过程中发生过『那种』事情吗
Was there ever anything romantic in your relationship with Mom,

723
00:36:44,439 --> 00:36:46,805
还是说你们只是普通朋友
or was it always just friendship?

724
00:36:48,778 --> 00:36:50,108
我们只是普通朋友
Uh, it was friendship.

725
00:36:51,879 --> 00:36:54,145
我还记得你说...
I remember you saying...

726
00:36:54,284 --> 00:36:56,912
你说那句话时我很惊讶
being surprised at you saying,

727
00:36:57,053 --> 00:37:01,319
『我们家里的每个人都知道』
"It's common knowledge in my family that, uh, my...

728
00:37:01,457 --> 00:37:03,448
『我妈当时爱上你了』
"that my mom was in love with you. "

729
00:37:03,593 --> 00:37:06,118
我当时很吃惊
And I was taken aback at that.

730
00:37:08,832 --> 00:37:09,958
我觉得有点触动
I was touched.

731
00:37:17,775 --> 00:37:20,301
杰弗坚持说
Everything Geoff said suggested he was certain

732
00:37:20,445 --> 00:37:23,504
黛安没有对迈克尔不忠
that Diane had stayed faithful to Michael.

733
00:37:24,714 --> 00:37:28,482
但她脑中的疑问之种仍在生长
But that seed of doubt had grown even larger in her mind.

734
00:37:29,321 --> 00:37:32,813
她觉得他是一个可爱 坦诚 慷慨的人
She thought he was a lovely,open,and generous person,

735
00:37:33,625 --> 00:37:36,254
但她也觉得他藏着秘密
and yet she felt he was hiding something.

736
00:37:36,962 --> 00:37:40,797
但她又一次放开了追问的那条线
But, once again, she let the story lie.

737
00:37:40,933 --> 00:37:43,595
这个谜团仍然没能解开
And so the conundrum remained just that.

738
00:37:44,437 --> 00:37:48,636
一天 她在多伦多偶然遇见一位蒙特利尔的制作人
One day, she chanced to meet a Montreal producer in Toronto

739
00:37:48,775 --> 00:37:52,574
提到自己要去蒙特利尔几天
and mentions that she's going to Montreal in a couple of days,

740
00:37:52,712 --> 00:37:55,614
那位制作人说『你到蒙特利尔以后』
and the producer says, "While you're there,

741
00:37:55,749 --> 00:37:58,547
『可以和哈利・高金见个面』
"you might want to meet up with Harry Gulkin.

742
00:37:58,685 --> 00:38:00,585
『他也是位电影制作人』
"He's an important film producer

743
00:38:00,721 --> 00:38:03,315
『在你母亲做选角导演时与她合作过』
"that your mother worked with as a casting director

744
00:38:03,457 --> 00:38:07,087
『或许可以帮助你了解下你母亲的事』
"and can probably tell you more about your mother in those days. "

745
00:38:07,228 --> 00:38:08,923
萨拉很高兴
And Sarah is very pleased.

746
00:38:09,063 --> 00:38:10,188
对自己出生前母亲的生活
She always likes to hear

747
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:12,959
她总是充满好奇
about her mother's life before Sarah's birth,

748
00:38:13,101 --> 00:38:15,262
同时她也觉得
and she also realized that this Harry

749
00:38:15,403 --> 00:38:17,064
哈利可能
may be able to shed more light

750
00:38:17,205 --> 00:38:20,265
会对母亲是否和当时的剧组成员有外遇一事
on the possibility of her mother having had an affair

751
00:38:20,408 --> 00:38:21,706
略知一二
with a member of the cast.

752
00:38:21,844 --> 00:38:23,902
所以她拨了哈利的电话
And so she phones Harry

753
00:38:24,045 --> 00:38:27,483
问他是否愿意和自己聊聊
and asks if she could get together with him for a chat.

754
00:38:27,617 --> 00:38:29,311
嗨 萨拉 谢谢你主动与我联系
Hi, Sarah,and a warm welcome.

755
00:38:29,984 --> 00:38:32,453
艾妮说你想见我
Arnie Gelbart told me you would like to see me.

756
00:38:32,588 --> 00:38:34,819
正好我也想见你
That's good,because I would love to see you.

757
00:38:34,958 --> 00:38:37,323
今天下午我会在办公室
I can be reached in my office this afternoon,

758
00:38:37,459 --> 00:38:38,790
或者你可以在白天时发邮件给我
or email me here during the day.

759
00:38:38,928 --> 00:38:40,260
嗨 哈利
Hi, Harry.Great to hear from you.

760
00:38:40,397 --> 00:38:43,525
我一直记得我妈总是用仰慕的语气谈论你
I always remember my mom talking about you with such affection.

761
00:38:43,667 --> 00:38:45,329
很高兴终于能和你见面
It'd be great to finally meet you.

762
00:38:45,468 --> 00:38:48,335
下午3：45有空到Ex-Centris外喝杯咖啡么
Would you be free at 3:45 to meet at Ex-Centris for a coffee?

763
00:38:48,471 --> 00:38:49,530
他同意了
He agrees,

764
00:38:49,673 --> 00:38:52,335
几天后 他们在一家餐馆见了面
and a couple of days later,they meet in a restaurant.

765
00:38:52,475 --> 00:38:54,239
接下来发生的事
What happens next is what I can remember

766
00:38:54,378 --> 00:38:57,107
我只能回忆起与萨拉有关的部分
of Sarah's relating the event.

767
00:39:07,492 --> 00:39:09,517
你说你一直很想见我
and you said that you had wanted to meet me

768
00:39:09,661 --> 00:39:13,428
因为你的母亲常常提到我
because your mother had talked about me a lot.

769
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:17,133
接着我们又聊了很多
And then we talked about a million things.

770
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:20,534
你说你十五岁时不得不退学
You told me how you had quit school at 15,

771
00:39:20,672 --> 00:39:22,641
最主要的一个原因是
and that one of the dominating reasons

772
00:39:22,775 --> 00:39:24,241
你当时的政治立场
was your politics at the time

773
00:39:24,376 --> 00:39:26,743
以及你打算加入阶级斗争军的行列
and your desire to join the class struggle.

774
00:39:26,879 --> 00:39:28,346
我觉得这很有意思
That struck me as very interesting,

775
00:39:28,481 --> 00:39:30,210
因为我曾经做过一模一样的事
because I had done exactly the same thing.

776
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:33,650
在那次谈话后 我们的关系变得很好
And we became very close during that conversation.

777
00:39:33,787 --> 00:39:36,187
我们在彼此身上找到了许多共同点
We found a whole number of things in common

778
00:39:36,323 --> 00:39:39,758
情感 反应 回应他人的方式
in terms of feelings, reactions, response.

779
00:39:39,893 --> 00:39:41,326
我记得你说 第一眼见到他
And I remember you saying,as soon as you met him,

780
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:43,793
就觉得有种莫名的安定感
you felt at ease with him in a certain way,

781
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:45,900
也正是因为这种安定感
and because you felt so at ease with him,

782
00:39:46,034 --> 00:39:48,059
让你决定问他是否知道
you had decided to ask him if he knew anything

783
00:39:48,203 --> 00:39:52,229
杰弗・博斯是你生父这一说法的真实性
about this rumor about Geoff Bowes being your dad.

784
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,974
你问他『你有没有听说过』
You asked him the question,"Have you ever heard anything

785
00:39:56,111 --> 00:39:59,274
『我妈在蒙特利尔演出时有了外遇』
"about my mom having had an affair while she was in Montreal?"

786
00:39:59,414 --> 00:40:00,473
你抬起头来对我说
You looked up and you said,

787
00:40:00,616 --> 00:40:02,880
『你觉得是杰弗・博斯么？』
"Do you think it was Geoff Bowes?"

788
00:40:03,786 --> 00:40:05,276
我说『不』
So I said, "No. "

789
00:40:06,022 --> 00:40:08,217
你又说『那你知道是谁么？』
She said, "Do you know who it was?"

790
00:40:08,357 --> 00:40:09,688
我说『我知道』
And I said, "Yes. "

791
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:12,122
『我知道杰弗・博斯不是你父亲』
"No, I know that Geoff Bowes isn't your dad. "

792
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:13,250
你说『你怎么知道？』
And you said, "How do you know that?"

793
00:40:13,396 --> 00:40:14,795
他说『因为我才是你父亲』
And he said, "Cause I'm your dad. "

794
00:40:16,066 --> 00:40:19,934
他说『可能 而非也许』
He said,"It's possible, not probable. "

795
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:21,902
你在电话里就是这么和我说的吧
I think those were the exact words you said to me on the phone.

796
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,063
是么
Were they?

797
00:40:23,206 --> 00:40:26,436
他说『我以为你是因为这个才来找我的』
He said, "I thought that's why you wanted to speak to me,

798
00:40:26,576 --> 00:40:30,067
『因为你妈妈和我之间的事』
"because your mom and I had an affair. "

799
00:40:30,212 --> 00:40:33,877
『事实上 她是和我外遇了』
"In fact, she had an affair with me. "

800
00:40:34,018 --> 00:40:35,713
我说『是我』
And I said, "Me. "

801
00:40:40,625 --> 00:40:42,252
你愣了一下
So you stopped for a moment,

802
00:40:42,393 --> 00:40:44,826
又说『你现在还这么觉得么』
then you said, "Do you still think so?"

803
00:40:44,961 --> 00:40:46,794
我说『在和你聊天...』
And I said, "After talking to you

804
00:40:46,932 --> 00:40:50,095
『近距离看着你将近三小时之后 我可以确定』
"and looking at you for close to three hours, yes. "

805
00:40:50,235 --> 00:40:51,600
我说『你觉得呢？』
I said, "What do you think?"

806
00:40:51,737 --> 00:40:55,139
而你说『嗯 我也觉得是这样』
And you said, "Yeah, I think so, too. "

807
00:40:55,275 --> 00:40:57,241
萨拉哑口无言
Sarah is speechless.

808
00:40:58,342 --> 00:41:01,471
他本想知道更多关于杰弗的事
She's come all this way to find out about Geoff,

809
00:41:02,482 --> 00:41:04,950
却意外地和母亲的情人共处了一下午
and now she's sitting with her mother's lover.

810
00:41:13,693 --> 00:41:17,595
那是1978年2月底的事了
It was late February of 1978.

811
00:41:17,731 --> 00:41:20,131
我当时心情有些沮丧
I was sort of mildly depressed...

812
00:41:20,267 --> 00:41:22,668
隆冬时节 无所事事 孤身一人
midwinter, nothing to do,living alone...

813
00:41:23,404 --> 00:41:26,168
我就决定去中央剧院看戏
and I decided to go to the Centaur Theatre

814
00:41:26,307 --> 00:41:29,764
大卫・费那里奥的新剧正在公演
to see the latest production of David Fennario.

815
00:41:29,909 --> 00:41:32,208
我刚进去不久
So I went down there,and after a minute,

816
00:41:32,346 --> 00:41:33,746
演员们就登台了
as the cast came on stage,

817
00:41:33,882 --> 00:41:38,251
出现在眼前的一位女士让我呆住了
I was transfixed by this glorious lady who was on stage.

818
00:41:38,386 --> 00:41:39,853
是完全被迷住了
Really just bowled over.

819
00:41:39,988 --> 00:41:43,947
戏落幕的时候 我仍然觉得很害羞
When the play was over,I still had certain reserves of shyness,

820
00:41:44,092 --> 00:41:45,490
从头到尾我都在害羞
which still remain,

821
00:41:45,626 --> 00:41:47,857
所以我没有去后台
so I didn't go backstage,

822
00:41:47,997 --> 00:41:49,793
而是打算睡前
and I decided to have a nightcap

823
00:41:49,931 --> 00:41:53,527
去那家『三驾马车』小酒馆喝一杯
at what I considered then my geriatric bar, the Troika.

824
00:41:53,669 --> 00:41:54,601
我点了杯饮料
I ordered a drink,

825
00:41:54,737 --> 00:41:56,500
酒吧里放着伤感的俄罗斯三重奏
and they had a schmaltzy Russian trio,

826
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,163
五分钟后
and after about five minutes,

827
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:00,833
刚才舞台上的那位女士
who walks in but this lady who had been on stage

828
00:42:00,978 --> 00:42:02,171
和其它剧组演员一起走了进来
with some other cast members,

829
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:04,040
我心想『哦 上帝啊』
so I figure, "Oh, my God,"

830
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:07,150
我便起身混进了那群人当中
and I sort of sidled into the middle of the group,

831
00:42:07,284 --> 00:42:08,980
不时地开口
and I was able to inveigle myself

832
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,178
插上一两句话
into the conversation to some degree,

833
00:42:11,321 --> 00:42:14,689
我试图找到和黛安单独说话的机会
and I did try to separate Diane from the group.

834
00:42:14,826 --> 00:42:16,918
但一小时后 我放弃了尝试
But after about an hour, it really was hopeless.

835
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:19,188
这种事不会发生的
It wasn't gonna happen.

836
00:42:21,332 --> 00:42:23,028
黛安离开『三驾马车』的时候
When Diane left the Troika,

837
00:42:23,168 --> 00:42:25,033
我跟上了那一群人
I walked with them and with her,

838
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:28,868
我问黛安是否能单独说句话
and I was trying again to separate Diane,

839
00:42:29,008 --> 00:42:30,031
她的回答是『不』
and she said, "No,

840
00:42:30,175 --> 00:42:31,972
『不过我们可以明晚再见』
"but we can meet tomorrow night. "

841
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:35,603
在剧组留在蒙特利尔演出的剩下的日子里
We met every night after that for the remainder of the run,

842
00:42:35,748 --> 00:42:39,184
我们每天晚上都会见面 感觉彼此被对方强烈地吸引
and there was a very strong mutual attraction...

843
00:42:39,318 --> 00:42:40,945
那种感觉非常 非常强烈
very, very powerful thing.

844
00:42:42,222 --> 00:42:44,815
哈利每天都会等在楼梯下面
Harry would be down at the bottom of the stairs,

845
00:42:44,957 --> 00:42:46,015
我们都呆在剧院二层
we were in the upstairs theater,

846
00:42:46,158 --> 00:42:47,490
化妆间也在那上面
and our dressing room was up there,

847
00:42:47,627 --> 00:42:50,118
他让我想到那些旧百老汇电影里
and it made me think of stage-door Johnnies

848
00:42:50,263 --> 00:42:52,697
守在剧场外的狂热粉丝
from those old Broadway movies.

849
00:42:52,832 --> 00:42:55,130
我记得他有次问我『黛安在上面吗？』
I remember once he asked,"Is Diane there?

850
00:42:55,268 --> 00:42:56,667
『可以麻烦你上去和她说我来了吗？』
"Could you go and tell her that I'm here?"

851
00:42:56,803 --> 00:42:58,930
然后我就上楼说『哈利来啦』
And, you know, bound back upstairs,say, "Harry's here. "

852
00:42:59,072 --> 00:43:00,734
她说『好』 然后就一溜烟跑下去了
"Okay," and then run back down the stairs.

853
00:43:00,875 --> 00:43:02,274
我就喊『她下去啦！』
"She's coming. "

854
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:06,313
哈利对她的热情相当炽烈
Harry developed this great,grand passion for her,

855
00:43:06,448 --> 00:43:09,473
他有一次对我说
and I think of Harry turning to me and saying,

856
00:43:09,618 --> 00:43:10,743
『她是不是很完美？』
"Isn't she wonderful?

857
00:43:10,885 --> 00:43:12,079
『是不是很有魅力？』
"Isn't she amazing?"

858
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:14,985
我觉得这太有意思了
And I just found this highly amusing,

859
00:43:15,123 --> 00:43:20,960
他是一个相当精明 工于世故的男人
because I understood that he was a super-smart, sophisticated man

860
00:43:21,097 --> 00:43:22,997
对电影圈的一切了如指掌
with all kinds of connections to the film business,

861
00:43:23,132 --> 00:43:26,191
但他和我谈话的话题却总是关于
but his main topic of conversation with me

862
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:28,566
黛安有多么完美
was the wonderfulness of Diane.

863
00:43:28,705 --> 00:43:30,569
这一点我是赞同的...
Which was...I agreed with him,

864
00:43:30,706 --> 00:43:34,939
但这些话在听过几次之后自然就腻了
but it becomes thin in terms of conversation material after a while.

865
00:43:35,078 --> 00:43:38,014
当你这样爱一个人的时候 你会变得极度自私
When you're in love like that,you become utterly selfish.

866
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:43,283
他人的感受不再重要
Nothing that's happening to anyone else matters at all

867
00:43:43,419 --> 00:43:45,853
或者说 你不会再考虑他人的感受
or is a matter of any consideration.

868
00:43:45,989 --> 00:43:48,390
你变成了一只野兽
You just end up sort of

869
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:52,755
专注 霸道
focused, intense,

870
00:43:52,897 --> 00:43:56,957
只想吞下爱情的猎物
and just wanting to consume the object of your love,

871
00:43:57,101 --> 00:44:00,537
周围的一切仿佛都不复存在
and nothing else exists.

872
00:44:02,274 --> 00:44:04,741
在他们排练的时候 我来探班过一次
I visited once during the rehearsal period,

873
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:07,471
首演当夜我也在场
and then I think I went up for the opening night.

874
00:44:07,613 --> 00:44:09,604
我想哈利当时应该也在那里
I guess Harry would have been there.

875
00:44:09,749 --> 00:44:12,377
但他那天没有和她上床 因为那天和她上床的是我
But he wasn't sleeping with her that night, "cause I was.

876
00:44:13,885 --> 00:44:14,875
很有意思 不是吗
It's funny, isn't it, though?

877
00:44:15,021 --> 00:44:17,955
在那场派对上 几个女人走到我跟前
At that party, a couple of women came up to me

878
00:44:18,089 --> 00:44:22,824
指责我对黛安是多么的不好
and started hectoring me about how badly I treated Diane.

879
00:44:22,963 --> 00:44:25,454
『你知道吗 你让她失望透了』
"You really put her down an awful lot, you know. "

880
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:26,998
我很震惊
I was quite stunned.

881
00:44:27,134 --> 00:44:29,069
之前从没有人...
Nobody before had ever...

882
00:44:30,736 --> 00:44:32,294
在我面前说过这些话
come right out and said that.

883
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:36,271
我当时陷入了沉思
I think certainly I began to think through this conversation,

884
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:38,001
『是 她们说的也许是对的』
"Yeah, they're probably right.

885
00:44:38,146 --> 00:44:40,273
『我让她失望了 我是个糟糕透顶的人』
"I am an awful person for putting her down,

886
00:44:40,415 --> 00:44:42,976
『如果她丧失自信』
"and if she lacks confidence,it may well be

887
00:44:43,118 --> 00:44:45,676
『那也许是我以前无意中说的某句话所导致的后果』
"because of some things that I have said in the past. "

888
00:44:45,819 --> 00:44:50,483
我突然想『或许她们知道这件事』
And suddenly I thought,"I wonder if they knew about it. "

889
00:44:50,624 --> 00:44:53,116
黛安可能和她们说过
Diane had probably talked to them about it,

890
00:44:53,261 --> 00:44:55,025
她正考虑离开我
that she was thinking of leaving me,

891
00:44:55,164 --> 00:44:57,632
因为我总在无形中打击着她的自信心
"cause I was not much good for her confidence.

892
00:44:57,766 --> 00:45:01,031
或许她们的话有三分警告的意味
And maybe they were sort of half warning me

893
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:02,694
想让我明白当时的情形
what was going on.

894
00:45:05,573 --> 00:45:07,701
在她回多伦多之前
Before she went back to Toronto,

895
00:45:09,379 --> 00:45:12,678
我让她带着孩子搬来蒙特利尔
I asked her to move to Montreal and to bring her kids here.

896
00:45:12,816 --> 00:45:14,477
当时的情况很复杂
It was complex and difficult.

897
00:45:14,617 --> 00:45:18,882
她很爱自己的孩子和丈夫
She had this passionate attachment to her kids and to her husband,

898
00:45:19,021 --> 00:45:22,514
但她也很爱我
and she also had this attachment to me,

899
00:45:23,292 --> 00:45:26,058
而我疯狂地爱着她
and I had an attachment which was completely crazy.

900
00:45:26,197 --> 00:45:29,690
我被爱情冲昏了头脑 完全昏了头
I was besotted,just utterly besotted,

901
00:45:29,835 --> 00:45:32,394
而她是那样充满生命里
and she was so full of life,

902
00:45:32,536 --> 00:45:35,096
你只想靠近她
and you just wanted to be there.

903
00:45:35,239 --> 00:45:36,830
只想靠近她
You just wanted to be there.

904
00:45:36,973 --> 00:45:39,442
这种感觉太疯狂了
I mean, it was wild.

905
00:45:39,577 --> 00:45:41,443
你说如果我们真的同居会怎么样？
How it would had been had we been living together,

906
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:43,775
其实我也不知道
I really have no idea.

907
00:45:43,915 --> 00:45:47,681
你不知道靠得太近的两人可能会...
You don't know what kind of clashes can...

908
00:45:48,421 --> 00:45:49,410
发生怎样的摩擦
can develop,

909
00:45:49,555 --> 00:45:51,714
尽管我怀疑我们或许可以过到一起去
although I suspect that it would have been okay.

910
00:45:51,856 --> 00:45:53,484
我觉得我们应该可以
I know it would have been okay.

911
00:45:58,765 --> 00:46:00,858
我们两个人 我和哈利
Both of us, both Harry and I,

912
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,468
都遇见了一个
met a person who was

913
00:46:05,571 --> 00:46:07,903
厌倦了她当下的生活
bored with her life as it currently was

914
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,371
想要寻求刺激的人
and wanted something more exciting.

915
00:46:10,876 --> 00:46:13,711
她有提起过自己的第一段婚姻么
Did she talk at all about her first marriage?

916
00:46:18,051 --> 00:46:19,643
我不记得太细节的东西了
I don't remember any of the detail,

917
00:46:19,787 --> 00:46:23,950
我知道他们吵架很厉害 日子越来越难挨
except that it was very acrimonious and exceedingly difficult,

918
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:29,496
失去孩子的抚养权也对她造成了很大打击
and her great distress over losing the kids.

919
00:46:30,565 --> 00:46:31,554
可以讲一下
Can you tell the story

920
00:46:31,699 --> 00:46:34,099
我妈和你爸之间的关系如何吗
of Mom's relationship with your dad?

921
00:46:35,204 --> 00:46:36,193
他们结了婚
They were married,

922
00:46:36,338 --> 00:46:40,501
我不清楚她对他感情有多深
and I don't know how deep her feelings were for him,

923
00:46:40,642 --> 00:46:41,940
但他对她用情很深
but his feelings were deep,

924
00:46:42,077 --> 00:46:44,443
这样的关系让人感觉不适
and it's awful to be in a relationship

925
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:46,104
因为这个人爱对方的程度
where one person loves the other

926
00:46:46,248 --> 00:46:48,740
远胜过对方爱自己
much more than the other person loves them,

927
00:46:48,885 --> 00:46:50,044
在所有的爱情关系里
and in every relationship,

928
00:46:50,186 --> 00:46:52,484
双方的爱或许都不是对等的
I think one person loves the other person more,

929
00:46:52,621 --> 00:46:54,590
但 幸运的是 这种差距很小
but, hopefully, it's close,

930
00:46:54,724 --> 00:46:57,385
幸运的是 这种差距是会逐渐变化的
and, hopefully, it goes up and down a little bit,

931
00:46:58,195 --> 00:46:59,389
但在我看来
but it seems to me

932
00:46:59,529 --> 00:47:02,931
爱情里永远不存在平等的概念
you never can both equally love each other the same amount.

933
00:47:03,067 --> 00:47:05,933
这个不幸的事实恰好就是生活的真谛
It's unfortunate,but it's just a fact of life.

934
00:47:06,069 --> 00:47:09,597
乔治是妈妈的父母
George was the kind of guy that Mom's parents

935
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:11,104
会很喜欢的那类人
would have been very happy with.

936
00:47:11,241 --> 00:47:14,507
因为他有钱有事业
He had money,and he had a good job.

937
00:47:14,645 --> 00:47:17,273
我一直觉得她太早嫁给他
So my sense has always been that she married him early,

938
00:47:17,415 --> 00:47:18,313
她嫁给他
and she married him

939
00:47:18,449 --> 00:47:21,112
只是因为他和她门当户对
because he was the kind of person she was supposed to marry.

940
00:47:21,253 --> 00:47:23,277
我觉得我爸对她管得多了一些
I think my dad was really controlling,

941
00:47:23,421 --> 00:47:26,016
而我妈一直很想摆脱这种束缚
and Mom wanted to get out from underneath that.

942
00:47:26,158 --> 00:47:28,889
她不想活在任何人的影子里
She was always trying to get out from under anything

943
00:47:29,028 --> 00:47:30,722
任人摆布
that she felt controlled her

944
00:47:30,863 --> 00:47:34,162
或是替她规划自己的生活
or made her feel like her life was very regulated.

945
00:47:34,299 --> 00:47:35,426
我们都有这样一种共识
We all feel that way.

946
00:47:35,568 --> 00:47:37,398
每到扔垃圾的日子我都有这样一种感觉
I feel that way every garbage day.

947
00:47:37,536 --> 00:47:39,595
每次我需要把垃圾拿出去的时候
Every time I have to take out the garbage,

948
00:47:39,739 --> 00:47:41,206
我就会想『哦 天哪』
it's just like, "Oh, my God. "

949
00:47:41,341 --> 00:47:44,105
这种例行公事会让你觉得生活被强加上了刻度
It makes you realize you're just marking time,

950
00:47:44,244 --> 00:47:45,973
就像是...
and it's just one of those things that...

951
00:47:47,947 --> 00:47:50,814
事实上 现在我都让男朋友倒垃圾
In fact, I make my boyfriend take the garbage out now.

952
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:52,076
这样我就不用去想这事了
Then I don't have to think about it.

953
00:47:52,218 --> 00:47:54,278
促使她离开
The trigger,the thing that compelled her

954
00:47:54,421 --> 00:47:55,945
第一段婚姻的契机
to leave then and there,

955
00:47:56,090 --> 00:47:58,718
应该是她第一次体会到了爱情的滋味
was that I think she really fell in love,

956
00:47:58,859 --> 00:48:01,829
也许她人生中第一次意识到
and maybe realized for the first time in her life

957
00:48:01,963 --> 00:48:04,089
自己的未来可能是什么样的
what her life could be.

958
00:48:04,231 --> 00:48:05,994
我想这是一种自救
I think she saved herself.

959
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:09,103
漂流海上的她抓住了一个救生浮标
I think she grabbed on to a life buoy.

960
00:48:09,237 --> 00:48:12,798
这样的决定是为了让自己有勇气生活下去
I think she made a choice to live.

961
00:48:12,941 --> 00:48:14,967
我真的 真的这样觉得
I really, really do.

962
00:48:15,111 --> 00:48:18,705
迈克尔就是那个浮标
And that was with Michael.

963
00:48:18,847 --> 00:48:21,008
她和我爸大吵了一架
She left my dad in the middle of a fight,

964
00:48:21,149 --> 00:48:22,981
把结婚戒指扔到雪地里
threw her wedding ring in the snow,

965
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:26,053
从家里走了出去 第二天又回来接我们
walked out, and then came back the next day to get us,

966
00:48:26,187 --> 00:48:27,917
我爸把家里的锁全换了
and my dad had changed all the locks.

967
00:48:29,492 --> 00:48:32,519
关于行为不检 我是个现行犯
From misbehavin",I'm in the red

968
00:48:33,230 --> 00:48:36,028
毫不令人意外 我一定没法结婚
Hardly surprising,I'll never be wed

969
00:48:36,166 --> 00:48:41,035
所谓行为不检 不过是算计手段
Instead I'm misbehavin',saving my revenue

970
00:48:41,171 --> 00:48:43,832
最后 乔治得到了孩子的抚养权
Ultimately, George got custody of the kids,

971
00:48:43,973 --> 00:48:47,502
这在六十年代是前所未闻的
and that was unheard of in the '60s,

972
00:48:47,645 --> 00:48:49,614
新闻还上了报纸头版
and it was front-page news.

973
00:48:49,748 --> 00:48:52,112
显然这是加拿大首例
And it was apparently the first time in Canada

974
00:48:52,249 --> 00:48:54,377
女性丧失孩子抚养权的案子
that a woman had ever lost custody of the kids,

975
00:48:54,519 --> 00:48:55,952
因为她和另外一个男人在一起了
and it was because she left for another man,

976
00:48:56,087 --> 00:48:58,884
这不是『端庄女性应有的行为』
and she wasn't "ladylike. "

977
00:49:00,758 --> 00:49:04,217
国家太大 百姓太小
# Ramifications for massive nations

978
00:49:04,363 --> 00:49:08,231
课税一重重 经济跑不动
# Involve taxation and then frustration

979
00:49:08,367 --> 00:49:12,302
我这样诚实的女孩 究竟该怎么办
# What is an honest girl to do?

980
00:49:12,972 --> 00:49:14,405
我是热锅上的蚂蚁
# I'm in a stew

981
00:49:15,975 --> 00:49:19,776
我被迫站街 来平衡赤字
# I walk the streets to balance the sheets

982
00:49:19,913 --> 00:49:23,713
生活重回正轨 阳光却不明媚
# My books are neat and on the beat again

983
00:49:23,850 --> 00:49:28,184
难道行为检点 能抵大堆账单？
# I'm misbehavin' to pay my IOUs

984
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:33,925
漏了一句词
I missed that line.

985
00:49:42,236 --> 00:49:45,694
我只记得 突然间 母亲就从我们生活中消失了
I remember all of a sudden my mom not being around,

986
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,435
我还记得大人在哭泣
and I can remember adults crying,

987
00:49:48,577 --> 00:49:50,943
我当时不相信大人也是会哭的
and I couldn't believe adults would be crying.

988
00:49:51,079 --> 00:49:53,809
看见我妈双手抱膝 蜷缩着
Seeing my mom with her knees pulled up to her chest,

989
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:56,441
一个人摇晃着坐在那里
just rocking back and forth.

990
00:49:56,586 --> 00:49:59,141
我有些懵懂地意识到『最糟糕的事已经发生了』
I knew as a child,"The worst thing has happened.

991
00:49:59,286 --> 00:50:02,620
『我不知道是什么事 但这的确是最糟糕的事了』
"I'm not sure what it is,but the worst thing is happening. "

992
00:50:02,758 --> 00:50:05,193
我知道 会有其他人
And I knew that there were other people

993
00:50:05,328 --> 00:50:07,888
来决定我的命运
who were gonna decide what happened to me

994
00:50:08,031 --> 00:50:10,295
和我妈的命运
and what happened to my mom.

995
00:50:11,367 --> 00:50:12,561
对此我无能为力
I had no control.

996
00:50:13,536 --> 00:50:16,027
从没有人问过我们这个问题 如果有人问
We were never asked,"cause had we been asked,

997
00:50:16,172 --> 00:50:18,036
我们肯定会说『我们想和妈妈一起住』
we would have said,"We want to live with our mom. "

998
00:50:18,174 --> 00:50:19,437
我们两个人都会这么说的
For sure, both of us would have.

999
00:50:19,576 --> 00:50:22,409
那个年纪的孩子所需要的就是这些
At that age, that's what you want.

1000
00:50:22,546 --> 00:50:26,277
我们一个月和妈妈见一次面
We'd have visitation with my mom once a month,

1001
00:50:26,417 --> 00:50:28,579
但我们和老爸一起住
but we lived with my dad,

1002
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,686
也找过两三个人来照顾我们
and there were a couple of caregivers.

1003
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:35,452
其中有一个是个年纪挺大的女人 她虐待我们
One of them was an older woman
who was physically abusive.

1004
00:50:35,593 --> 00:50:37,561
一个虐待我们的后妈
A successive step-mother who abused us.

1005
00:50:37,696 --> 00:50:39,891
这句话你可以留着 我无所谓
You can keep this in, too. I don't care.

1006
00:50:40,899 --> 00:50:42,800
我记得那时候妈妈开车送我们回家
I remember when Mom used to drive us home,

1007
00:50:42,935 --> 00:50:44,128
她得向我们告别的时候
when she'd say good-bye to us all the time,

1008
00:50:44,269 --> 00:50:45,792
她会一直哭
she would cry and cry.

1009
00:50:45,936 --> 00:50:49,396
很多年以后我们回忆起这些
And I remember years later reminiscing back on that,

1010
00:50:49,542 --> 00:50:51,874
想起她不住地哭泣 我们也会哭
how she would cry and cry, and we'd be crying,

1011
00:50:52,011 --> 00:50:54,673
我们必须告别 进屋去
and we'd have to say good-bye
and go into the house,

1012
00:50:54,814 --> 00:50:56,476
我们不想走
and it was like, we didn't want to leave,

1013
00:50:56,616 --> 00:50:58,139
因为我们还想和她呆在一起
"cause we wanted to be with her.

1014
00:51:06,159 --> 00:51:08,354
这些事会把你慢慢吞噬
But I would think
that would just eat away at you

1015
00:51:08,495 --> 00:51:09,724
一天天地
every day of your life, right,

1016
00:51:09,864 --> 00:51:12,957
因为你错过了那么多和你孩子在一起的时光
that you missed
so many moments with your kids.

1017
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:15,865
都是快乐的时光 对吗？
And that's the happy stuff, right?

1018
00:51:16,003 --> 00:51:18,163
错过了那些快乐的时光 但是...
You missed the happy stuff, but...

1019
00:51:19,272 --> 00:51:21,002
更进一步地说
into that that you'd miss...

1020
00:51:22,143 --> 00:51:24,634
最终她发现
that she would have found out ultimately

1021
00:51:24,779 --> 00:51:25,973
她错过的不仅是这些
that she not only missed that,

1022
00:51:26,114 --> 00:51:28,413
同时也错过了...
but she wasn't there to pr...

1023
00:51:35,824 --> 00:51:37,724
她没能在那里保护孩子们
She wasn't there to protect them.

1024
00:51:46,435 --> 00:51:47,960
这样做父母真的很难受
It's really bad being a parent.

1025
00:51:48,104 --> 00:51:49,230
真笨
Stupid.

1026
00:51:50,773 --> 00:51:52,969
因为你真的...
'Cause you're really, you know...

1027
00:51:55,678 --> 00:51:57,543
真的...
You really, uh...

1028
00:51:58,715 --> 00:52:00,775
想到自己的孩子正在受到伤害
The thought of your kid getting hurt

1029
00:52:00,918 --> 00:52:02,909
而你不能去那里保护他们
and you not being there to protect them...

1030
00:52:03,053 --> 00:52:05,077
你知道事情只能是这样
you know that's gonna happen,

1031
00:52:05,221 --> 00:52:08,191
但妈妈肯定这样想过
but Mom must have thought,

1032
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:12,152
“我都做错了什么才变成今天这样？”
"What did I do wrong that led to this?"

1033
00:52:20,071 --> 00:52:22,540
所以我想这件事的影响肯定是很严重的
So I think the impact
must have been terrible

1034
00:52:22,675 --> 00:52:26,201
让她一直都感觉很伤心 对吗？
and must have made her sad all the time, right?

1035
00:52:27,679 --> 00:52:31,274
或许这就是我觉得...
And maybe that's also what
I sort of pieced together in...

1036
00:52:31,416 --> 00:52:34,250
我以为她一直让自己忙忙碌碌地是因为
in making this assumption
that she was just keeping busy

1037
00:52:34,387 --> 00:52:36,048
要让自己忘记这些痛
to forget the pain.

1038
00:52:38,692 --> 00:52:40,488
你能感觉到她对于自己失去了孩子们
Did you get a sense that she felt guilty

1039
00:52:40,626 --> 00:52:42,595
而感到愧疚吗？
about the loss of her kids?

1040
00:52:42,729 --> 00:52:44,127
是的
Yes.

1041
00:52:44,263 --> 00:52:45,355
噢是的
Oh, yes.

1042
00:52:47,634 --> 00:52:51,694
我觉得这些事带给了她很多不安全感
I think that it lodged a certain level
of insecurity into her,

1043
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:55,298
也是这些让她决定
which I think had
some bearing on her decision

1044
00:52:55,443 --> 00:52:58,172
不来跟我一起生活
not to come live with me.

1045
00:52:59,346 --> 00:53:01,406
她不可能没有挣扎过
I can't imagine that she didn't struggle with it,

1046
00:53:01,549 --> 00:53:04,073
但事实是 她有一个家
but there was the fact that there was a house

1047
00:53:04,218 --> 00:53:07,279
有好几个孩子 会要她留下
and a bunch of kids living in it
that would have kept her,

1048
00:53:07,422 --> 00:53:09,288
我猜因为这些她才感觉
and I guess she would have felt

1049
00:53:09,425 --> 00:53:11,256
为了孩子们留下来才是正确的选择
that that was the right choice for her children.

1050
00:53:11,961 --> 00:53:13,655
或许对她自己来说也是这样
And maybe for her, too.

1051
00:53:13,795 --> 00:53:17,561
或许她仍旧希望着她和爸爸
Maybe she still hoped that her and Dad

1052
00:53:17,699 --> 00:53:19,223
可以重新爱上彼此
would fall in love again or something.

1053
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:24,606
我们在蒙特利尔初次见面的几个月之后
A few months after we had
first made contact in Montreal,

1054
00:53:24,741 --> 00:53:28,108
她给我打电话来说她怀孕了
she phoned me and she told me
that she was pregnant,

1055
00:53:28,245 --> 00:53:30,804
并且她认为 孩子的父亲是我
and she said that she thought
that I was the father.

1056
00:53:30,946 --> 00:53:32,777
她告诉我的是
What she communicated to me,

1057
00:53:32,915 --> 00:53:36,044
或者我听出来的是 一种兴奋
what I got from her, was almost a thrill.

1058
00:53:36,186 --> 00:53:38,814
所以她和迈克尔的关系
So in terms of the relationship with Michael

1059
00:53:38,955 --> 00:53:40,514
和家庭的关系 都让她沮丧
and the house, she was upset.

1060
00:53:40,658 --> 00:53:43,321
但和我在一起 她很兴奋
In terms of the relationship with me, she was thrilled.

1061
00:53:43,462 --> 00:53:46,623
我想这会帮我更快地追求到她
I thought that would help me
in my cause, in my pursuit.

1062
00:53:46,763 --> 00:53:49,699
我是说 就算没有这个孩子
I mean, quite apart
from the anticipation of a child,

1063
00:53:49,834 --> 00:53:52,496
我也感觉好事将近了
I felt, well,
this is a quiver in my bow.

1064
00:53:54,939 --> 00:53:58,137
现在我们已经超越了婚外情的关系
I mean, we have
more than an affair to deal with.

1065
00:53:58,277 --> 00:53:59,676
我们有孩子了
We have a child.

1066
00:54:00,512 --> 00:54:02,242
你出生以后
And when you were born,

1067
00:54:02,381 --> 00:54:05,577
她寄了照片给我 怀里抱着婴儿
she sent me that picture,
holding you as a tiny infant,

1068
00:54:05,716 --> 00:54:07,981
后来又寄来了你单人的照片
and then she sent me
a picture by yourself

1069
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,280
在你一岁的时候
when you were one year old.

1070
00:54:12,825 --> 00:54:16,694
后来 因为公务我经常来多伦多
Subsequently, business brought me
to Toronto quite frequently,

1071
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:19,194
所以我能经常去 见到戴安
so I was there quite often,
and I would see Diane.

1072
00:54:19,331 --> 00:54:22,324
她也还算频繁地去蒙特利尔
She would come to Montreal
reasonably often.

1073
00:54:22,468 --> 00:54:25,028
戴安把我介绍给她所有的朋友们
Diane would introduce me to all her friends,

1074
00:54:25,171 --> 00:54:27,572
所以我们的恋情可以说是很公开了
so our affair was a pretty open thing,

1075
00:54:27,708 --> 00:54:28,970
因为你也会需要这些
because you need that, too,

1076
00:54:29,109 --> 00:54:31,600
对于恋情来说 你会需要这些的
and somehow you want that
in terms of a love affair.

1077
00:54:31,745 --> 00:54:33,235
需要见证人
You need witnesses.

1078
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:36,110
需要他们来见证你们的关系
You need witnesses
which sort of confirm you.

1079
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:37,477
我觉得...
I think it was...

1080
00:54:37,617 --> 00:54:39,313
他们还是很慎重的
It was very discreet.

1081
00:54:39,453 --> 00:54:42,890
我不认为这是众所周知的吧
I don't think it was
really common knowledge.

1082
00:54:43,024 --> 00:54:45,288
有一些人知道
I think there were a number
of people who knew,

1083
00:54:45,427 --> 00:54:47,452
但没人聊起来过
but nobody ever talked about it.

1084
00:54:47,595 --> 00:54:49,223
我告诉过她我绝不会跟人说起此事
I told her I would never discuss it with anyone,

1085
00:54:49,365 --> 00:54:50,763
我也确实没有
and I never did.

1086
00:54:51,999 --> 00:54:55,731
我做出了承诺 她也是我的好友
I promised, and she was my buddy,

1087
00:54:55,870 --> 00:54:57,269
所以我是绝对不可能
and there was no way on God's earth

1088
00:54:57,405 --> 00:54:58,998
聊起这件事的
I was gonna talk about it.

1089
00:54:59,141 --> 00:55:00,665
我不能这样做
I couldn't do that to her.

1090
00:55:00,810 --> 00:55:02,904
所以当时情况很尴尬
So there was this strange situation

1091
00:55:03,046 --> 00:55:04,842
我们的恋情已经公开
of an openness of an ongoing affair,

1092
00:55:04,981 --> 00:55:07,416
持续了有差不多两年
which went on for,
I believe, a couple of years

1093
00:55:07,551 --> 00:55:09,245
分隔蒙特利尔和多伦多两地
in Montreal and in Toronto,

1094
00:55:09,385 --> 00:55:13,720
但却没有进一步发展的可能
and yet no possibility
of it ever developing into anything more.

1095
00:55:13,857 --> 00:55:16,349
越来越清楚的事实是
What became clear at a certain point

1096
00:55:16,494 --> 00:55:20,657
你会跟着迈克尔和戴安一起长大
was that you were gonna grow up
with Michael Polley and Diane,

1097
00:55:20,797 --> 00:55:22,425
而且
and there was not only no point,

1098
00:55:22,567 --> 00:55:26,662
给你的生活造成阴影不仅没有必要 而且是个错误
that it would be absolutely a mistake
to cast a shadow on that.

1099
00:55:51,764 --> 00:55:53,790
她在几个方面都处理得很好
She operated on all these levels.

1100
00:55:53,933 --> 00:55:55,594
对所有人都很诚心
She was loyal on all these levels.

1101
00:55:55,735 --> 00:55:58,932
她有这种力量和能力
I think that she had
the strength and the ability

1102
00:55:59,072 --> 00:56:01,563
对所有人都很诚心
to keep all her loyalties going.

1103
00:56:01,708 --> 00:56:02,869
所有人
All of them.

1104
00:56:03,010 --> 00:56:04,442
异地并没有帮到我们
The distance didn't help.

1105
00:56:07,313 --> 00:56:10,282
但反过来说 异地也让感情更强烈
But on the other hand,
to some degree, it intensified it,

1106
00:56:10,417 --> 00:56:12,886
因为这里面会有一种期待
because there's
the longing that was involved,

1107
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:17,980
我想 我们互相爱着彼此 有很长时间
and I think that we remained in love
for a very long time.

1108
00:56:26,368 --> 00:56:30,667
我记得 在戴安的葬礼他们说
I remember
at Diane's funeral they said,

1109
00:56:30,806 --> 00:56:32,205
“谁都可以发言，”
"Anybody can speak,

1110
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:33,671
“如果你想发言，完全可以”
"so if you want to speak, you can speak. "

1111
00:56:33,809 --> 00:56:35,675
我觉得这主意太蠢了
"That," I thought,
would be very stupid.

1112
00:56:35,812 --> 00:56:37,142
“我以什么身份发言啊？”
"In what capacity I should speak?"

1113
00:56:37,279 --> 00:56:38,303
所以我没有
So I didn't.

1114
00:56:38,447 --> 00:56:41,281
葬礼结束以后 我上前去
When it was over,
I went to say my farewells

1115
00:56:41,417 --> 00:56:43,248
跟家人们告别
and good-byes to the family,

1116
00:56:43,386 --> 00:56:46,549
我双手抱住迈克尔
and I went to put my arms around Michael,

1117
00:56:46,689 --> 00:56:48,816
我感觉到 在我手中 他一动不动
and I felt that he froze in my arms,

1118
00:56:48,958 --> 00:56:50,482
似乎很不舒服
that he was uncomfortable with that.

1119
00:56:50,626 --> 00:56:53,595
那时候我就想 或许迈克尔已经知道
That's what made me think
that perhaps Michael really knew,

1120
00:56:53,729 --> 00:56:54,992
或许她告诉过他了
perhaps she told him.

1121
00:56:55,132 --> 00:56:56,224
什么？
What?

1122
00:56:56,366 --> 00:56:57,957
你记得当时见到哈利了吗？
Do you remember
meeting Harry there?

1123
00:56:59,069 --> 00:57:00,627
他当时不在吧 对吗？
I don't think he was there. Was he?

1124
00:57:00,772 --> 00:57:01,932
- 应该是的 - 他当时在？
- Think so, yeah.
- Was he there?

1125
00:57:02,073 --> 00:57:03,164
嗯
Yeah.

1126
00:57:04,741 --> 00:57:07,175
我当时没见到他
No, I didn't meet him there.

1127
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:09,808
我记得安・泰特
I remember Anne Tait,

1128
00:57:09,948 --> 00:57:12,279
她是举办各类仪式的专家
who was the master of ceremonies.

1129
00:57:12,416 --> 00:57:14,248
她说到戴安的时候 说
She was speaking of Diane,
and then she said,

1130
00:57:14,385 --> 00:57:17,183
“你们也知道有时候戴安会到处调情”
"And, you know,
sometimes Diane was a flirt,

1131
00:57:17,322 --> 00:57:19,051
“但她的心是一直属于迈克尔的”
but her heart belonged to Michael. "

1132
00:57:23,462 --> 00:57:25,725
在活动结束之后 我离开
On the way out
after the ceremony,

1133
00:57:25,864 --> 00:57:29,130
你的姑姑安 迈克尔的妹妹 她告诉我
your Aunt Anne,
Michael's sister, said to me,

1134
00:57:29,268 --> 00:57:32,636
“看见没 哈利？她的心是属于迈克尔的”
"You see, Harry?
Her heart really belonged to Michael. "

1135
00:57:32,772 --> 00:57:34,569
所以那也打消了我
So that sort of put pay to my sense

1136
00:57:34,708 --> 00:57:37,369
进一步联系波利一家人的想法
of any further contact
with the Polley family.

1137
00:57:37,510 --> 00:57:39,842
倘若我还有一点感知
If I ever had had
any sense that I should,

1138
00:57:39,979 --> 00:57:41,538
我都应该全身而退
I figured I really better back right off,

1139
00:57:41,681 --> 00:57:44,171
我也是这样做的 虽然这让人非常沮丧
which I did,
but I found that very upsetting.

1140
00:57:44,316 --> 00:57:45,784
她的离世让我难过
I found her dying upsetting,

1141
00:57:45,919 --> 00:57:49,014
在诸多事情面前我的无能
then I found my inability
in those circumstances

1142
00:57:49,157 --> 00:57:52,091
没有来个好好的告别 没有去亲力亲为
to do a proper farewell
and to be part of it

1143
00:57:52,225 --> 00:57:55,423
我都感到很难过 很后悔
something that I felt
bad about and regretted.

1144
00:57:57,063 --> 00:57:59,328
不管何时哈利提起戴安
Whenever Harry spoke of Diane,

1145
00:57:59,467 --> 00:58:03,733
一开始 他提到她生了一个女儿
from the beginning, he mentioned
that she had had a daughter

1146
00:58:03,871 --> 00:58:05,601
是他们恋爱的结晶
as a result of their affair,

1147
00:58:05,741 --> 00:58:07,402
所以我一直有这个印象在
so it was always in the background,

1148
00:58:07,543 --> 00:58:10,568
但这么多年以来他从未见过你
but all those years
that he never saw you,

1149
00:58:10,711 --> 00:58:12,702
也从未提起过
it was never discussed.

1150
00:58:12,847 --> 00:58:14,839
不管何时我看到你的报道什么的
Whenever I'd see articles
about you or anything,

1151
00:58:14,983 --> 00:58:16,644
我都会问，“哈利，你看了这篇报道吗？”
I'd say, "Harry, did you see the article?"

1152
00:58:16,785 --> 00:58:19,346
让他知道最近你都发生了什么
just so that he'd be aware
of what was happening,

1153
00:58:19,489 --> 00:58:23,721
但他那天去见过你以后 回到家里
but the day when he went down
to meet you and came home,

1154
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:26,760
好像整个世界彻底变了
it was like the world changed.

1155
00:58:26,895 --> 00:58:31,332
能和你重新有了联系 他非常高兴
He was so happy he could have
a relationship with you,

1156
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:35,700
和你在咖啡馆见面之后 他的世界彻底改变了
so his whole world changed
after that cafe meeting with you.

1157
00:58:35,839 --> 00:58:37,864
这么多年来都一直没有发生的
Through all the years
that that never happened,

1158
00:58:38,008 --> 00:58:40,238
但他也从未抱怨过 从未说过“我真希望...”
he never complained,
he never said, "I wish. "

1159
00:58:40,377 --> 00:58:42,743
我甚至不认为他自己这么想过
I don't even think he said it to himself.

1160
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:45,245
他只是想，“如果不行，”
He just... "If it's not gonna happen,

1161
00:58:45,381 --> 00:58:47,179
“如果我也无能为力”
"if I can't do anything about it,

1162
00:58:47,318 --> 00:58:48,444
“那么就装看不见吧”
"I don't see it.

1163
00:58:48,586 --> 00:58:49,611
“就当不存在”
"It does not exist. "

1164
00:58:49,754 --> 00:58:51,051
他就是这样走过来的
That's the way he lives.

1165
00:58:51,189 --> 00:58:52,884
然后你回了多伦多
And then you went back to Toronto,

1166
00:58:53,024 --> 00:58:57,619
我们开始疯狂地互相写邮件
and we began almost
a frantic series of email exchanges

1167
00:58:57,761 --> 00:58:59,558
想继续维持父女关系
about continuing the encounter.

1168
00:58:59,697 --> 00:59:00,995
当时感觉很强烈
There was an intensity,

1169
00:59:01,132 --> 00:59:05,900
这种爱的感觉 很强烈
just really an incredible intensity
of affection, of love.

1170
00:59:06,038 --> 00:59:07,335
就像...
I mean, it was...

1171
00:59:08,841 --> 00:59:11,708
逐渐了解你以后 这种强烈才慢慢平复
Having gotten to know you,
much of that has dissipated.

1172
00:59:11,844 --> 00:59:13,004
虽然不再强烈 但...
It's gone away, but...

1173
00:59:15,348 --> 00:59:18,613
但当时真的...
But it just was really...

1174
00:59:21,755 --> 00:59:24,053
嗨哈利 能见到你真高兴
Hi, Harry.
It was great to meet you.

1175
00:59:24,191 --> 00:59:26,455
真的很开心 多棒的见面
A complete pleasure
and quite an occasion.

1176
00:59:26,593 --> 00:59:28,255
之前我从未想过这会是如此重要的见面
I had no idea it would
be so eventful.

1177
00:59:29,097 --> 00:59:30,085
我真的当时是后来才想起
It was really just an afterthought

1178
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:31,890
要问你关于妈妈私人生活的问题
to ask you
about my mother's personal life.

1179
00:59:32,031 --> 00:59:34,466
和你一起聊天很轻松
It just came out of feeling
very comfortable with you

1180
00:59:34,601 --> 00:59:37,366
我就想，“为什么不问问他知道什么呢？”
and thinking,
"Why not ask him what he knows?"

1181
00:59:37,505 --> 00:59:40,702
能知道这么多 我很高兴
And then what a delight
to get so much information.

1182
00:59:41,409 --> 00:59:43,241
希望我们可以保持联系
I hope we can stay in touch.

1183
00:59:43,379 --> 00:59:44,970
能和你共度时光真好
It was so great to spend some time.

1184
00:59:45,647 --> 00:59:47,376
现在我该看看关于你的纪录片了
（《哈利・加尔金：大路上的黎明》）
Now I'll watch the documentary about you.

1185
00:59:47,515 --> 00:59:49,210
在这种情况下
What a handy tool in a situation like this

1186
00:59:49,350 --> 00:59:53,082
这么一张关于我生父的有教育意义的DVD
是多么地有帮助啊
to have an educational DVD on your
previously unknown biological father.

1187
00:59:53,222 --> 00:59:54,587
挺滑稽吧
Hilarious.

1188
00:59:54,723 --> 00:59:59,057
从共产主义者到商人再到文化事业
Making his way from communism
to commerce to culture,

1189
00:59:59,862 --> 01:00:02,195
哈利丰富的人生经验
Harry's many lives sometimes feel

1190
01:00:02,332 --> 01:00:05,789
就像小丑服的填字游戏
like the crossword patches
of a harlequin costume.

1191
01:00:05,934 --> 01:00:09,098
我第一次见到哈利的时候 他是电影制片人
When I first met Harry,
he was a film producer,

1192
01:00:09,239 --> 01:00:10,501
《父亲的谎言》（1975）
and Lies My Father Told Me

1193
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:14,098
赢得了当年金球奖的最佳外语片
had won Hollywood's Golden Globe
for Best Foreign Film.

1194
01:00:14,244 --> 01:00:18,044
泰德・阿兰的剧本提名了奥斯卡奖
The script by Ted Allan
was nominated for an Oscar.

1195
01:00:18,181 --> 01:00:19,478
《父亲的谎言》
Lies My Father Told Me

1196
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:21,881
给了正在雏形中的加拿大电影产业
gave the fledgling
Canadian film industry

1197
01:00:22,019 --> 01:00:25,011
一份艺术上和行业上的肯定
artistic and professional credentials.

1198
01:00:25,156 --> 01:00:26,817
你好 萨拉
Hello again, Sarah.

1199
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:28,117
我坦白 我们的重逢
I confess our encounter

1200
01:00:28,259 --> 01:00:30,750
现在也是我生命中最大的事
has stayed uppermost
in my consciousness, too.

1201
01:00:30,895 --> 01:00:34,195
情感也有所冲撞：有发现的快乐
The emotions are conflicting:
joy at discovery,

1202
01:00:34,333 --> 01:00:36,596
有带着悲伤色彩的美好回忆
sweet memory obscured
by sadness,

1203
01:00:36,734 --> 01:00:39,226
当然也有担心
and some concern
as to how this reasonable,

1204
01:00:39,371 --> 01:00:43,899
关于这次很确凿却没有证据的事情
对你和你的家人造成的影响
but unproven assumption might affect you,
as well as your family.

1205
01:00:44,042 --> 01:00:46,772
我们真的需要抽点时间好好讨论
We really need to take some time out
to discuss this.

1206
01:00:46,912 --> 01:00:49,381
与此同时 我还有个疑问
Meanwhile,
I suspect it would be prudent

1207
01:00:49,515 --> 01:00:52,210
关于不对外公开这件事是否是谨慎的选择
not to broadcast
this putative discovery.

1208
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:56,118
如果那样 你就没有遵从戴安的意愿了
In that respect, you would
not be following in Diane's footsteps.

1209
01:00:56,255 --> 01:00:58,883
她本人显然是很乐意的
She was apparently
very pleased with the idea

1210
01:00:59,025 --> 01:01:02,018
毫不犹豫地告诉了他人
and didn't hesitate
to share it with some others.

1211
01:01:02,162 --> 01:01:03,992
比争议更重要的是
What is beyond dispute

1212
01:01:04,130 --> 01:01:06,793
我们已经成为了亲密的朋友
is that we have
become close and loving friends.

1213
01:01:07,468 --> 01:01:08,492
嗨
Hi there.

1214
01:01:08,635 --> 01:01:10,830
我也很乐意进一步讨论
I would love to discuss this some more.

1215
01:01:10,971 --> 01:01:13,201
我和我的哥哥约翰尼说了 过程挺有意思
It's been interesting talking
to my brother, Johnny, about it.

1216
01:01:14,208 --> 01:01:16,473
我们都很担心如果爸爸发现会怎么样
We're both tremendously afraid
of my dad finding out.

1217
01:01:17,411 --> 01:01:19,436
这会彻底毁了他的 我觉得
It would destroy him, I think,

1218
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:22,812
所以我坚决认为不应该让他知道我们的交谈
so I'm quite resolved to not let him
know about our conversation.

1219
01:01:22,951 --> 01:01:25,818
但是 我也在考虑 我自己确实很想确认一下
However, I have been thinking
that I'd really love to know for myself.

1220
01:01:25,954 --> 01:01:27,683
我不知道为什么 但如果问题不得到回答
I'm not sure why,
but it feels like an odd question

1221
01:01:27,822 --> 01:01:29,620
会觉得它当时的提出就很奇怪吧
to not have answered
once it's been raised.

1222
01:01:29,759 --> 01:01:33,455
当时萨拉就提出 一个DNA测试
Now was the moment when Sarah
suggested that a DNA test

1223
01:01:33,596 --> 01:01:35,564
就会给所有问题一个最终的答案
would settle the matter once and for all.

1224
01:01:35,698 --> 01:01:38,667
哈利先是反对 说自己要考虑一下
Harry resisted and said he'd like to think it over.

1225
01:01:38,801 --> 01:01:40,133
他在担心
He was worried what effect

1226
01:01:40,270 --> 01:01:42,203
这件事会给迈克尔和他的家人带来怎样的影响
it would have on Michael and his family

1227
01:01:42,338 --> 01:01:44,670
如果哈利真的是亲生父亲
if it turned out that Harry was the father,

1228
01:01:44,807 --> 01:01:46,775
并且他也不确定自己会怎么想
and he wasn't too sure how he would feel

1229
01:01:46,909 --> 01:01:49,504
如果迈克尔是生父的话
if Michael turned out
to be the sperm donor.

1230
01:01:49,646 --> 01:01:52,979
为了避免这些伤害 为什么不保持现状呢？
To save all hurt,
why not leave things as they are?

1231
01:01:53,116 --> 01:01:54,744
爸 那一句可以再念一次吗？
Dad, can you take that line back again?

1232
01:01:54,886 --> 01:01:55,875
嗯
Yeah.

1233
01:01:56,020 --> 01:02:00,149
为了避免这些伤害 为什么不保持现状呢？
To save all hurt,
why not leave things as they are?

1234
01:02:03,394 --> 01:02:06,227
你来做DNA测试的那个周末
The weekend you came
to do the DNA test,

1235
01:02:06,364 --> 01:02:09,094
你走了进来 当时情况就好像...
you walked in the door,
and it was kind of like,

1236
01:02:09,233 --> 01:02:11,429
“我们先把口水吐这棍子上吧”
"Well, let's put the spit
on the stick first

1237
01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:12,594
“快点搞定它”
"and get it over with. "

1238
01:02:12,738 --> 01:02:14,136
我想这是我们做的第一件事
I think it was one
of the first things we did.

1239
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:15,570
你进来 坐下
You came in, you sat down,

1240
01:02:15,707 --> 01:02:16,901
拿着棍子 两个人都采样
get out the stick, you both spit.

1241
01:02:17,042 --> 01:02:19,009
再把棍子交掉 所以我们当时
You put 'em in,
and so we got that

1242
01:02:19,143 --> 01:02:21,009
是带着笑声做完这件事的
out of the way with lots of laughter.

1243
01:02:21,146 --> 01:02:24,114
然后你应该是在我们办公室呆了一会儿
And then I think you were staying in our office,

1244
01:02:24,248 --> 01:02:28,584
凯茜给了哈利一张照片 她笑得很开心的
and Cathy had given Harry
a picture of herself with a big smile,

1245
01:02:28,721 --> 01:02:30,245
我把照片放在他桌上
and I had put it on his desk.

1246
01:02:30,390 --> 01:02:33,415
你看到照片 就说
And you look at the picture, and you said,

1247
01:02:33,559 --> 01:02:36,723
“噢我的天哪，我们的嘴简直一模一样！”
"Oh, my God,
we've got the same mouth!"

1248
01:02:36,863 --> 01:02:39,627
我就跑进来 看到照片
So I ran in, and I looked at the picture,

1249
01:02:39,766 --> 01:02:41,928
看看你的笑容 再看看凯茜的
and I looked at your smile,
and I looked at Cathy's,

1250
01:02:42,069 --> 01:02:45,630
我就想 这一定是真的
and I thought,
"You know, this is gonna work.

1251
01:02:45,773 --> 01:02:47,933
“这就是一家人啊”
"This is the same family. "

1252
01:02:48,776 --> 01:02:52,074
在2007年1月22日礼拜一
On Monday, January the 22nd, 2007,

1253
01:02:52,745 --> 01:02:54,577
萨拉的人生永远地改变了
Sarah's life changed forever.

1254
01:02:55,583 --> 01:02:59,179
她打开挂号信 看到了结果
She opened the registered letter
and read the results.

1255
01:02:59,321 --> 01:03:04,087
结果说 哈利・加尔金是萨拉・波利的亲生父亲
It recorded that Harry Gulkin
was Sarah Polley's biological father,

1256
01:03:04,225 --> 01:03:07,821
鉴定结果准确率99%
and that the test results
were 99% certain.

1257
01:03:07,963 --> 01:03:10,760
99.97%的概率
99.97% sure.

1258
01:03:10,898 --> 01:03:13,232
那种程度的可能性啊
That was the level of probability.

1259
01:03:13,369 --> 01:03:16,703
我甚至都没有试着去揣测她的想法
I won't even try to guess
what her thoughts were

1260
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:20,001
不知她是如何接受这个事实的
as she digested that stunning discovery.

1261
01:03:21,644 --> 01:03:25,512
整整28年都接受着这样的事实 是很长的时间
28 years of sitting on something
like that is a long time,

1262
01:03:25,648 --> 01:03:29,176
而终于能够确认这真的是真的了
and having the ability
to know it indeed is true

1263
01:03:29,319 --> 01:03:31,787
绝对是天大的快乐
was just sheer delight.

1264
01:03:31,922 --> 01:03:33,253
欣喜若狂
Exuberance.

1265
01:03:33,390 --> 01:03:38,850
“百分之99.9997%的概率我是她父亲，耶”
"It's 99.9997 sure.
I'm her father. Yay. "

1266
01:03:38,995 --> 01:03:41,157
我的说法这就是“蜜月期”
I use the expression
"the honeymoon period. "

1267
01:03:41,298 --> 01:03:42,994
一句话，“人生太美好了”
Nothing but, "Isn't life wonderful?"

1268
01:03:43,134 --> 01:03:44,863
等了太久了
A long time coming.

1269
01:03:45,003 --> 01:03:45,992
嗨 萨拉
Hi, Sarah.

1270
01:03:46,704 --> 01:03:48,569
一有机会我想马上就去多伦多
I want to get up to Toronto as soon as feasible

1271
01:03:48,707 --> 01:03:51,140
就在接下来的几个礼拜
during one of the next few weekends

1272
01:03:51,276 --> 01:03:53,836
这样我能介绍凯茜认识她的妹妹了
so that I can introduce
Cathy to her kid sister,

1273
01:03:53,978 --> 01:03:55,240
如果你想的话
that is, if you're up for it.

1274
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:57,007
我也理解 现在这件事
It is understood
that all of this will be done

1275
01:03:57,148 --> 01:04:01,108
还不能给所有人知道
with the understanding that the news
is not for general consumption.

1276
01:04:01,253 --> 01:04:03,313
而对我来说 我的心在跳舞
As for me, my heart is dancing.

1277
01:04:03,456 --> 01:04:07,358
萨拉 对我来说 你就是快乐的代言和化身
Sarah, for me, you're the bearer
and the incarnation of pure joy.

1278
01:04:07,494 --> 01:04:09,358
爱你的 哈利/爸爸
Love, Harry/Daddy.

1279
01:04:09,495 --> 01:04:11,257
我打开门 你就站在门口
I opened the door. You were at the door.

1280
01:04:12,898 --> 01:04:15,265
你当时穿着
And you were wearing

1281
01:04:15,402 --> 01:04:17,893
跟我一样的标志性的汗衫
the identical sweatshirt I was wearing.

1282
01:04:18,038 --> 01:04:20,302
那衣服我还从没见其他人穿过
I have yet to see anyone else
wear that sweatshirt.

1283
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,306
然后 当然的 你笑了
And then, of course, you smiled,

1284
01:04:22,443 --> 01:04:26,378
我就看到了那标志性的露牙床的笑
and I saw the identical gummy grin that I have

1285
01:04:26,513 --> 01:04:29,209
其他人也很少有的
that I haven't seen
on very many people, either.

1286
01:04:29,350 --> 01:04:31,716
我就想“我们有相同的基因，这是肯定的”
I went, "Yeah, we share DNA,
that's for sure. "

1287
01:04:31,852 --> 01:04:34,320
我觉得我们表达自己的方式也很相似
We express ourselves, I think,
in a really similar way.

1288
01:04:34,455 --> 01:04:37,686
我们会晃动手臂 傻笑个不停
We wave our arms around, we giggle a lot,

1289
01:04:37,825 --> 01:04:41,955
我们还发现 我们可以畅所欲言
and then we realized
that we could talk our heads off

1290
01:04:42,096 --> 01:04:43,358
持续好多个小时
for hours and hours
and hours and hours

1291
01:04:43,497 --> 01:04:45,295
一直都会有话题
and never run out of things to say.

1292
01:04:46,368 --> 01:04:49,064
嗨 哈利 我还在想着上个周末
Hi, Harry.
Still thinking about the weekend.

1293
01:04:49,204 --> 01:04:51,695
能见到凯茜 和你们共度周末 真好
It was so great to meet Cathy
and spend some time with you.

1294
01:04:52,374 --> 01:04:54,605
我觉得我们的“逾越节计划”都在按想法进行
I think our Passover plans
are all in order.

1295
01:04:54,744 --> 01:04:56,803
这是我第一次写这个词呢
First time I've ever written that.

1296
01:04:56,946 --> 01:05:00,176
对于我父亲 我有很奇怪而强烈的负罪感
I'm having a strange onslaught of guilt
about my dad in all this.

1297
01:05:00,883 --> 01:05:04,580
要理清它 一点都不容易或者简单
Sorting it through, but it's
not at all easy or uncomplicated,

1298
01:05:04,721 --> 01:05:06,086
正如你提醒过的一样
as you warned.

1299
01:05:06,222 --> 01:05:08,851
我肯定时间会让事情更明白和简单
I'm sure time will make things
clearer and easier.

1300
01:05:08,993 --> 01:05:10,755
期待着再次见到你
Looking forward to seeing you again soon.

1301
01:05:11,561 --> 01:05:13,586
没有什么能改变她对迈克尔的爱
Nothing could change
about her love for Michael

1302
01:05:13,730 --> 01:05:15,425
或者那些突然变成了
or for those who had suddenly become

1303
01:05:15,565 --> 01:05:17,796
同母异父的哥哥姐姐们
half-sisters and half-brothers,

1304
01:05:17,935 --> 01:05:22,066
但现在她有了全新的同父异母的兄弟姐妹们需要认识
but now she had
an entire new half-family to get to know.

1305
01:05:23,708 --> 01:05:25,572
在收到结果以后不久
Soon after reading that registered letter,

1306
01:05:25,709 --> 01:05:28,543
萨拉就把这个消息告诉了她的哥哥姐姐们
Sarah tells the news to her brothers and sisters,

1307
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:31,945
于是是否应该把这件事告诉我成为了新的问题
and the question whether
I should be told is now raised.

1308
01:05:32,083 --> 01:05:34,244
似乎只有马克认为我是可以接受的
It seems that only Mark felt I could handle it,

1309
01:05:34,386 --> 01:05:35,854
但大家一致认为
but the consensus was

1310
01:05:35,988 --> 01:05:38,751
真的没有必要冒这个险让我感到难过
that there really was
no need to risk upsetting me,

1311
01:05:38,890 --> 01:05:41,985
我不知道这件事 生活也可以继续下去
and life could continue smoothly
with me in ignorance.

1312
01:05:42,662 --> 01:05:43,923
能不能谈一谈
Can you talk about the impact

1313
01:05:44,062 --> 01:05:46,861
这件事对我们家的影响？
that this news had on our family?

1314
01:05:46,999 --> 01:05:50,333
我不觉得我们家有什么变化
I don't get the sense
that much changed in our family.

1315
01:05:51,137 --> 01:05:52,832
噢 除了这个 我们后来全都离婚了
Oh, except that we all got divorced.

1316
01:05:54,941 --> 01:05:56,465
忘了这个 不好意思
Forgot about that. Whoops.

1317
01:05:58,177 --> 01:06:02,114
家里的三个女儿都离婚了
Except all three daughters got divorced.

1318
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:03,910
对啊 有道理哦
Yep. Good point.

1319
01:06:05,118 --> 01:06:06,346
有道理
Good point.

1320
01:06:06,486 --> 01:06:08,455
是啊 天哪 我想我们都...
Yeah. God, I guess we all...

1321
01:06:09,157 --> 01:06:11,317
我们对这件事的反应很有意思
We all had interesting reactions to it.

1322
01:06:11,458 --> 01:06:13,859
我觉得马克的反应是另一种
I feel like Mark worked the other way.

1323
01:06:13,995 --> 01:06:16,862
他很努力地让自己的家庭变得更加稳固
He worked to solidify
the family he had,

1324
01:06:16,998 --> 01:06:19,159
而我们三个女儿选择了逃避
and we three daughters hightailed it.

1325
01:06:22,336 --> 01:06:23,736
除了这一点 没什么特别的
So, other than that, nothing.

1326
01:06:25,506 --> 01:06:27,771
这件事确实从某种程度上改变了
It does sort of make you alter the way

1327
01:06:27,910 --> 01:06:30,538
你看待婚姻的方法
that you look at your relationship.

1328
01:06:30,678 --> 01:06:35,707
这样的事实让我们看到了其他的真相
A truth like that that opens up
kind of begets other truths,

1329
01:06:35,851 --> 01:06:38,786
当你发现了这些
and when you discover truths like that,

1330
01:06:38,921 --> 01:06:43,552
你对这件事引发的结果的想法就被隐瞒了
how you think about truths
within that are concealed.

1331
01:06:44,793 --> 01:06:45,988
我想 任何一件事
I suppose, as much as anything,

1332
01:06:46,129 --> 01:06:49,122
你听说一个人做了这样的事
when you hear
about someone doing that

1333
01:06:49,266 --> 01:06:50,495
打破了所有规矩
and breaking the rules,

1334
01:06:50,634 --> 01:06:53,329
它打破了忌讳 会让你想
it breaks a kind of taboo,
and it makes you think,

1335
01:06:53,470 --> 01:06:55,632
“我们都在同样的问题里挣扎”
"We're all struggling
with the same kinds of problems,

1336
01:06:55,773 --> 01:06:58,297
“看看她惹的这些麻烦”
"and look at the mess she got into

1337
01:06:58,441 --> 01:07:00,706
“还试着装作一切都没问题”
"trying to look like everything was okay. "

1338
01:07:00,845 --> 01:07:03,313
我觉得 这件事最难接受人的是马克
It seemed to me like it was difficult for Mark.

1339
01:07:03,447 --> 01:07:06,349
他最大的感觉是
I think the biggest thing with him I got

1340
01:07:06,485 --> 01:07:08,112
对妈妈很失望
was that he was disappointed in Mom.

1341
01:07:08,886 --> 01:07:10,286
你有这感觉吗？
Did you get that?

1342
01:07:10,422 --> 01:07:11,445
我觉得就是这样
I think that was it.

1343
01:07:12,223 --> 01:07:14,055
他很失望 还有点吃惊
He was disappointed
and sort of surprised,

1344
01:07:14,192 --> 01:07:17,184
我觉得我没有
and I guess I wasn't.

1345
01:07:17,328 --> 01:07:18,853
我觉得我的感受是
I think the main thing that I felt

1346
01:07:18,997 --> 01:07:21,159
在听到哈利这件事以后
after hearing the news about Harry

1347
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:24,564
我对妈妈是持批评态度的
was my feeling critical of Mom

1348
01:07:24,703 --> 01:07:26,568
我觉得她不仅仅是有了婚外情
and thinking
how she didn't just have an affair.

1349
01:07:26,705 --> 01:07:29,937
想必也是非常鲁莽的 因为没有采取节育措施
She was reckless, presumably,
in terms of birth control,

1350
01:07:30,076 --> 01:07:32,100
最终导致有了孩子
and ends up having a baby.

1351
01:07:32,244 --> 01:07:37,082
她如此失控 是多么疯狂的一件事啊
To think how crazy it was of her
to be that out of control,

1352
01:07:37,218 --> 01:07:41,050
这情况多让人害怕啊 有了孩子
it's a pretty scary scenario,
the idea of having a kid

1353
01:07:41,187 --> 01:07:44,315
生父是其他人
that belongs to someone else biologically,

1354
01:07:44,457 --> 01:07:46,551
并且还要继续生活下去
and you have to try to carry on your life,

1355
01:07:46,693 --> 01:07:49,594
对自己的至亲隐瞒这个事实
hiding that fact from the people
you're closest to.

1356
01:07:49,730 --> 01:07:52,199
如何去撒谎 是很复杂的
The complexity of lying about it,

1357
01:07:52,333 --> 01:07:56,270
以及对生活造成的压力 都让人害怕
and the stress that that would put
on your life is a bit terrifying.

1358
01:07:56,405 --> 01:07:58,871
这真是告诫我们在婚外情的时候要注意节育措施啊
It's a real lesson about birth control

1359
01:07:59,006 --> 01:08:00,998
如果没有其他意义的话
when you're having affairs,
if nothing else.

1360
01:08:01,876 --> 01:08:03,104
多谢了
Thanks a lot.

1361
01:08:04,011 --> 01:08:05,947
那我们都会好得很了
And then we'd all be better off.

1362
01:08:06,081 --> 01:08:07,981
就像《生活多美好》一样
It's like This Is a Wonderful Life.

1363
01:08:09,351 --> 01:08:11,410
噢不对 那电影刚好相反 对吧？
Oh, no, it was the reverse, wasn't it?

1364
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:13,448
那是九月中旬
It's the middle of September,

1365
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:17,354
萨拉去了蒙特利尔 拍摄《无姓之人》
and Sarah went to Montreal
for the shoot of Mr. Nobody.

1366
01:08:17,492 --> 01:08:19,154
只有很短的时间来考虑
Little time in all that to consider

1367
01:08:19,295 --> 01:08:21,924
是否该告诉我DNA测试的事
whether she should tell me of the DNA test.

1368
01:08:22,065 --> 01:08:26,798
萨拉当时正扮演一位年轻的尼安德特女子
Sarah is on set shooting a scene
as a young Neanderthal woman.

1369
01:08:26,937 --> 01:08:30,395
我经常做这样的梦 在史前的某个时间
I often have this dream.
Some prehistoric time.

1370
01:08:32,508 --> 01:08:33,999
我能听见你的尖叫
I can hear you screaming.

1371
01:08:37,014 --> 01:08:40,814
我追赶狗熊 你不再害怕了
I chase the bear,
and you're not afraid anymore.

1372
01:08:41,752 --> 01:08:43,050
萨拉当时正
Sarah is sitting around

1373
01:08:43,188 --> 01:08:46,678
化着妆 戴着尼安德特人的假额头
in her makeup and prosthetic
Neanderthal forehead

1374
01:08:46,823 --> 01:08:50,089
然后接到一个多伦多记者的电话
when she gets a phone call
from a reporter in Toronto.

1375
01:08:50,228 --> 01:08:52,424
他告诉萨拉说他刚刚得知了这个消息
He tells her that he's just heard the story

1376
01:08:52,564 --> 01:08:55,124
她发现了失散的亲生父亲这件事
of her discovering her lost biological father

1377
01:08:55,267 --> 01:08:57,667
想要在多伦多的报纸上报道
and would like to run it in his Toronto newspaper

1378
01:08:57,803 --> 01:09:01,035
来询问她对此事的看法
with her reaction to this amazing discovery.

1379
01:09:01,174 --> 01:09:03,266
萨拉震惊了
Sarah is appalled.

1380
01:09:03,408 --> 01:09:05,603
她还没有告诉我 并且那个时候
She has not told me,
and at this juncture

1381
01:09:05,744 --> 01:09:07,838
她也不确定是否要说
is not sure that she ever will.

1382
01:09:07,981 --> 01:09:09,039
她开始哭起来
She begins to cry

1383
01:09:09,182 --> 01:09:11,013
乞求记者不要登这报道
and begs the reporter not to run the story,

1384
01:09:11,150 --> 01:09:13,141
因为她还没告诉自己的父亲
because she's not yet told her father.

1385
01:09:13,286 --> 01:09:15,949
记者说这是令人开心的事
The reporter points out
that it's a very happy story,

1386
01:09:16,090 --> 01:09:18,080
没必要哭
and there's no reason to cry about it,

1387
01:09:18,224 --> 01:09:20,283
但萨拉哭得更凶了
but Sarah cries even harder.

1388
01:09:20,426 --> 01:09:22,758
她拿着手机跑到街上
She runs out into the street with her cell phone

1389
01:09:22,896 --> 01:09:24,489
好不让剧组的人发现
so that no one on the set will see her,

1390
01:09:24,632 --> 01:09:27,795
她跑到一个公园 找到长椅坐下
and she crosses to a park
and seeks refuge on a bench.

1391
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:30,097
在那里她继续求那个人不要登报道
There she begs the man not to go ahead,

1392
01:09:30,238 --> 01:09:33,297
至少等到她联络到父亲之后
at least until she's contacted her father.

1393
01:09:33,441 --> 01:09:36,841
电话打完 萨拉还继续哭了几分钟
Sarah continued her cry
for some minutes after the call,

1394
01:09:36,977 --> 01:09:38,775
然后她注意到有很多人
and then she noticed that
a considerable number of people

1395
01:09:38,914 --> 01:09:39,938
在看着她
were looking at her,

1396
01:09:40,081 --> 01:09:42,641
她就想起来蒙特利尔人还是很不一样的
and she recalls thinking
how different Montrealers were

1397
01:09:42,785 --> 01:09:44,411
跟多伦多人比起来
from their Toronto counterparts,

1398
01:09:44,552 --> 01:09:46,747
他们要是看见一个年轻姑娘流眼泪
who, observing a young girl in tears,

1399
01:09:46,888 --> 01:09:48,686
会装作什么都没看见
would have pretended it never happened.

1400
01:09:48,824 --> 01:09:52,486
她回到摄影棚 想洗掉脸上的泪痕
She went back into the studio
to wash her tear-stained face,

1401
01:09:52,627 --> 01:09:54,289
眼前是这样一个尼安德特女人
and there was this Neanderthal woman,

1402
01:09:54,430 --> 01:09:56,057
在镜子里瞪着自己
staring at her in the mirror.

1403
01:09:58,768 --> 01:10:01,761
你看 你就是没法把喜剧面具完全抛下
You see, you just can't keep
the mask of Comedy at bay.

1404
01:10:02,506 --> 01:10:05,770
看着悲剧的面具演得正欢
It watches old Tragedy doing his bit,

1405
01:10:05,908 --> 01:10:08,502
一不留神
and the moment he lets his guard down,

1406
01:10:08,644 --> 01:10:11,671
喜剧老兄就跳了出来
old Comedy turns up the corners of his mouth.

1407
01:10:12,549 --> 01:10:15,313
但这正是一个预警 事情是不可预见的
But it was an alarming
and unforeseen turn of events,

1408
01:10:15,453 --> 01:10:16,579
萨拉现在也知道了
and Sarah now knew

1409
01:10:16,721 --> 01:10:19,052
她必须告诉我一切
that she would have to tell me everything.

1410
01:10:19,189 --> 01:10:21,556
萨拉终于给我写了一封邮件
Sarah was at last able to email me

1411
01:10:21,693 --> 01:10:25,151
说她24号礼拜四那天离开蒙特利尔
that she was leaving Montreal
on Thursday the 24th,

1412
01:10:25,296 --> 01:10:28,629
想来我这里喝杯茶
and that she would like to come
round to my place for tea.

1413
01:10:28,766 --> 01:10:30,961
礼拜四到了 我收拾好了桌子
Thursday came, and I cleaned off the table

1414
01:10:31,102 --> 01:10:34,402
还稍稍努力地收拾了一下屋子
and made a bit of an effort
to clean up my living space a little.

1415
01:10:34,540 --> 01:10:38,305
我甚至还打了苍蝇 这很少见的
I even swatted my fly, which is rare.

1416
01:10:38,443 --> 01:10:41,971
在这房子里 苍蝇通常都是我的好伙伴
Flies are frequently
my companions in this loft.

1417
01:10:42,114 --> 01:10:44,275
它们一直一次只飞来一只
They invariable arrive only one at a time,

1418
01:10:44,416 --> 01:10:47,078
我会尽力让它们舒舒服服的
and I do my best to make
them feel comfortable.

1419
01:10:47,219 --> 01:10:50,280
我已经说过了 我不是一个擅长社交的人
I told you already that
I'm not a particularly sociable person.

1420
01:10:50,423 --> 01:10:53,620
毫无疑问地 我更善于跟苍蝇交流
There's not doubt
that I'm more at ease with flies,

1421
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:55,250
或者至少说是孤独的苍蝇
or at least solitary ones.

1422
01:10:55,395 --> 01:10:57,590
我必须承认 我会跟它们说话
I must confess that I talk to them,

1423
01:10:57,731 --> 01:11:00,757
它们不能回话我也不觉得难过
and I'm not at all discomforted
by their failure to reply.

1424
01:11:01,468 --> 01:11:04,266
它们也很孤单 跟我一样
And they're alone, like me.

1425
01:11:05,038 --> 01:11:06,130
抱歉打断了
Sorry about this digression,

1426
01:11:06,272 --> 01:11:07,433
但我希望这能让你知道
but I hope it'll give you some idea

1427
01:11:07,575 --> 01:11:12,172
萨拉来之前我打了苍蝇 是很大的牺牲
of the sacrifice I'd made with my swatter
before Sarah's arrival.

1428
01:11:12,314 --> 01:11:15,111
她到了以后 我让她在桌子前坐下
And once she got here,
I made her sit down at the table

1429
01:11:15,783 --> 01:11:18,616
我马上就开始说今天的主要娱乐
and went right into
my main entertainment to the meal,

1430
01:11:18,753 --> 01:11:21,416
是安娜・克里斯蒂的故事（尤金・奥尼尔的戏剧）
which was the story of Anna Christie,

1431
01:11:21,556 --> 01:11:24,319
因为它我开始示范醉酒的样子
which led to my demonstration
of the acting of drunkenness

1432
01:11:24,458 --> 01:11:26,393
在整个20世纪中戏剧中
throughout the 20th century.

1433
01:11:26,528 --> 01:11:28,690
头天晚上 我看了嘉宝的第一部有声片
The night before,
I'd seen Garbo in her first talkie

1434
01:11:28,831 --> 01:11:31,094
里面还有玛丽・杜斯勒
along with Marie Dressler,

1435
01:11:31,233 --> 01:11:33,463
她演得很棒
and I found her acting fascinating.

1436
01:11:33,602 --> 01:11:34,627
你也知道 我可以继续
You know, I can go on

1437
01:11:34,771 --> 01:11:37,205
聊这些表演的话题聊好几个小时
about these thespian matters for some hours.

1438
01:11:41,477 --> 01:11:44,504
茶和米布丁已经摆在桌上了
So, the tea and the rice pudding
were already on the table

1439
01:11:44,648 --> 01:11:47,207
在萨拉面前摆了好一会儿 她才有机会开口说话
in front of Sarah before she got
a chance to speak.

1440
01:11:47,350 --> 01:11:50,548
你当时坐在桌子对面
And you were sitting on the opposite side
of the table from me,

1441
01:11:51,921 --> 01:11:53,480
现在在等我说完
obviously waiting for me to finish,

1442
01:11:53,624 --> 01:11:55,524
但我以为你没有什么要紧事要说
but I didn't think you had
anything important to say.

1443
01:11:55,659 --> 01:11:57,489
我以为我们只是聊聊天
I thought we were just gonna chat,

1444
01:11:57,627 --> 01:12:00,496
所以等我终于快要说完的时候
and so when I finally got to the end of my story,

1445
01:12:00,632 --> 01:12:03,601
你说，“我今天过来的原因是”
you said something like,
"The reason I wanted to come and see you

1446
01:12:03,735 --> 01:12:07,603
“有重要的事情要对你说”
"is that I have something
kind of important to tell you. "

1447
01:12:07,739 --> 01:12:09,604
于是你开始讲这件事
Then you started into the story,

1448
01:12:09,741 --> 01:12:14,611
花了好一阵子才说到最终的真相
and it took you quite a while
to get to the moment of truth,

1449
01:12:14,747 --> 01:12:16,545
如果真相是合适的词的话
if we can use that expression.

1450
01:12:17,217 --> 01:12:21,585
道出真相的一刻 我突然认识到
That great moment of truth
when I suddenly realized,

1451
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:24,187
“我的天哪 她在说什么”
"Oh, my God, what she's saying

1452
01:12:24,322 --> 01:12:29,023
“是说我不是她的亲生父亲啊”
"is that I'm not actually
her biological father. "

1453
01:12:32,666 --> 01:12:35,329
我坐着 害怕地沉默着
I sat there in abject silence,

1454
01:12:35,470 --> 01:12:36,766
就像萨拉当时
as Sarah must have done

1455
01:12:36,903 --> 01:12:38,961
发现哈利是自己父亲的时候一样
when she found that Harry was her father.

1456
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:42,668
思绪不断地涌入我的脑海
Thoughts ran in and out of my mind.

1457
01:12:43,510 --> 01:12:46,378
“这不可能 不可能”
"That's impossible. It couldn't be.

1458
01:12:46,514 --> 01:12:47,981
“我在做梦”
"I'm dreaming. "

1459
01:12:50,818 --> 01:12:52,444
我目瞪口呆
I was quite stunned.

1460
01:12:53,788 --> 01:12:59,590
天哪 我们开了这么多年玩笑的事
My God, all this stuff
we'd been joking about for years,

1461
01:12:59,727 --> 01:13:01,753
竟然是真的
it's actually true.

1462
01:13:01,897 --> 01:13:04,991
我好一阵才缓过来
It took me a while to recover, and...

1463
01:13:07,937 --> 01:13:10,803
我记得当时我说...
And then I remember saying...

1464
01:13:11,539 --> 01:13:14,236
“哈利？哈利・加尔金？”
"Harry? Harry Gulkin?"

1465
01:13:14,376 --> 01:13:16,208
你说的是
And then you said something like,

1466
01:13:16,346 --> 01:13:18,143
“但这不代表会有什么变化，对吗？”
"But it doesn't make
any difference, does it?"

1467
01:13:18,281 --> 01:13:22,378
我说，“这的确不会有什么变化”
And I said, "No, it doesn't make
any difference at all,

1468
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:23,817
“对你和我来说”
"not to you and I,

1469
01:13:23,954 --> 01:13:25,385
“我们之间的关系”
"in terms of our relationship.

1470
01:13:25,521 --> 01:13:28,082
“还会和以前一样”
"It's still exactly the same as it was before. "

1471
01:13:31,996 --> 01:13:35,056
我记得 你走到桌子这边
And then I remember
you came round the table

1472
01:13:35,199 --> 01:13:37,827
用手抱住我的肩膀 说
and put your arm
round my shoulder and said,

1473
01:13:37,968 --> 01:13:40,938
“我真高兴这件事不会让我们有什么不同”
"No, I'm so glad it doesn't make
any difference, does it?"

1474
01:13:41,872 --> 01:13:43,430
我说
And I was, uh...

1475
01:13:43,574 --> 01:13:44,870
我觉得有趣的是
I thought it was funny.

1476
01:13:45,009 --> 01:13:47,945
这是我们几年来最亲密的一次了
That's the closest we've been
in quite a few years,

1477
01:13:48,079 --> 01:13:49,741
你抱住我的肩膀说
to put your arm round me and say,

1478
01:13:49,882 --> 01:13:51,974
“爸，没有什么会不同”
"Dad, it doesn't make any difference. "

1479
01:13:53,552 --> 01:13:57,851
我之后应该还问了你一些其他的问题
And I suppose I asked you
a few more questions then about it,

1480
01:13:57,988 --> 01:14:03,930
因为你跟我说的一切都太不可思议了
because it was a tremendous story
you were telling me,

1481
01:14:04,064 --> 01:14:06,395
那么多的巧合
and so many little coincidences

1482
01:14:06,532 --> 01:14:09,263
和怪事都一起发生了
and strange things had happened.

1483
01:14:11,103 --> 01:14:12,263
突然地 我开始认识到
And suddenly, I began to realize,

1484
01:14:12,405 --> 01:14:15,602
“天哪 这是个很棒的故事啊”
"My God, this is a great story.

1485
01:14:15,741 --> 01:14:18,734
“这是个非常棒 非常棒的故事”
"This is a great, great story. "

1486
01:14:19,479 --> 01:14:22,278
我是说 我喜欢写作 但无法下手
I mean, I enjoy writing, but I can't get started,

1487
01:14:22,417 --> 01:14:25,510
因为对于自己要写什么 我没有什么好点子
because I never have any ideas
about what I want to write about.

1488
01:14:25,652 --> 01:14:28,986
自从这件事发生 它给了我灵感
And since this came up,
it started me off,

1489
01:14:29,123 --> 01:14:31,282
我发现这些吸引人的故事
realizing how many fascinating stories

1490
01:14:31,424 --> 01:14:33,553
都在一个人自己的生活里
there are to be told in one's own life

1491
01:14:33,695 --> 01:14:35,128
而不用费力去寻找
without having to try to look

1492
01:14:35,263 --> 01:14:37,595
外部世界的故事
for what's an interesting story outside.

1493
01:14:37,732 --> 01:14:41,396
我发现 这是个了不起的故事
I began to realize what a remarkable story

1494
01:14:41,537 --> 01:14:43,300
是她赋予我的
she had thrown into my lap.

1495
01:14:43,439 --> 01:14:46,771
渐渐地 我对整个故事有了大概轮廓
Gradually, I began to build up
a picture of the whole thing,

1496
01:14:47,775 --> 01:14:51,507
关于戴安的过去 和我自己的行为
and so much of Diane's past
and of my own actions

1497
01:14:51,647 --> 01:14:53,547
以不同的角度呈现
appeared in a different light.

1498
01:14:53,682 --> 01:14:56,914
这些事启发了我内心的执着
The revelations had awoken
an obsession in me

1499
01:14:57,053 --> 01:15:00,682
把这故事告诉每一个愿意倾听的人
to tell the whole story
to anyone who would listen.

1500
01:15:00,824 --> 01:15:04,282
我对写作的热情逐渐增加
My growing enthusiasm
for the narrative itself,

1501
01:15:04,427 --> 01:15:07,863
同时我也对自己的过去不断重新评价
as well as the constant
re-evaluation of my own past,

1502
01:15:07,998 --> 01:15:10,763
我把自己锁在房间里整整两天
drove me around my room for two days,

1503
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:12,026
到了礼拜六
and then on Saturday,

1504
01:15:12,168 --> 01:15:14,729
我终于给萨拉写了一封邮件
I was finally able
to send an email to Sarah

1505
01:15:14,872 --> 01:15:17,272
总结了我的想法：
with this summary of my thoughts:

1506
01:15:17,974 --> 01:15:19,238
我亲爱的萨拉
My dear Sarah,

1507
01:15:19,377 --> 01:15:22,973
过去的24小时内 我的大脑在飞快地运转
my mind has been racing
over the past 24 hours.

1508
01:15:23,115 --> 01:15:26,709
把我的想法尽可能都写在纸上 我希望
Getting as many of my thoughts
down on paper will, I hope,

1509
01:15:26,851 --> 01:15:29,616
让那疯狂的思维稍稍休息
stop that feverish mental pursuit

1510
01:15:29,755 --> 01:15:32,815
并把事情全部从我的角度叙述
and put it all
into what is my perspective.

1511
01:15:32,958 --> 01:15:36,621
不管我们怎么做 我们都不能怪戴安
Whatever we do,
we must not put any blame on Diane

1512
01:15:36,762 --> 01:15:40,755
那些发生在1878年的陈年往事
for those events
that took place in 1978.

1513
01:15:41,634 --> 01:15:44,329
当时我们结婚已经超过10年了
We had been married then
for over ten years,

1514
01:15:44,469 --> 01:15:46,870
我们的婚姻也并不完美
and our union was not a perfect one.

1515
01:15:47,006 --> 01:15:51,137
她已经遭受了生活的重创
She had already experienced
one major disaster in her life

1516
01:15:51,278 --> 01:15:53,370
经历了一次失败的婚姻
with the breakdown of her first marriage

1517
01:15:53,513 --> 01:15:55,846
以及失去了两个孩子
and the subsequent loss
of the two children

1518
01:15:55,983 --> 01:15:57,813
她深爱的孩子们
that she loved so much.

1519
01:15:57,950 --> 01:16:00,385
现在她又被困在一个没用的丈夫身边
And now here she was stuck
with a husband who was useless

1520
01:16:00,521 --> 01:16:02,455
无法让她感到他需要她
at making her feel wanted,

1521
01:16:02,589 --> 01:16:05,684
所以她去蒙特利尔排戏的时候
and so when she went
to Montreal to do Toronto,

1522
01:16:05,827 --> 01:16:08,454
她爱上别人可以说一点都不令人吃惊
it's scarcely surprising
that when love was expressed

1523
01:16:08,595 --> 01:16:11,086
爱情降临了 她也接受了
and then offered to her, she took it.

1524
01:16:11,799 --> 01:16:14,166
我一直这么告诉她 说应该去找个情人
I'd always told her
she should take a lover

1525
01:16:14,302 --> 01:16:16,236
只要她觉得我不够好的时候
any time she felt me inadequate,

1526
01:16:16,371 --> 01:16:17,928
只要她不会
just so long as she did not think

1527
01:16:18,072 --> 01:16:20,507
离开马克、乔或者我
of leaving Mark and Jo or me.

1528
01:16:20,642 --> 01:16:22,873
当然 她根本也没想要离开前两个孩子
Of course, she would never
have left another two children,

1529
01:16:23,012 --> 01:16:25,775
我也不会和她争夺抚养权
and I would never have disputed
her claim for custody,

1530
01:16:25,914 --> 01:16:29,248
所以我只是在担心自己的将来而已
so it was clearly my own future
that I was worried about.

1531
01:16:30,453 --> 01:16:32,443
所以就发生了她和哈利的恋情
And so we arrive
at the affair with Harry,

1532
01:16:32,587 --> 01:16:35,557
并且 也并非没人预料到的是 它发生在
and, not unexpectedly,
it took place at the same time

1533
01:16:35,691 --> 01:16:39,423
正好我去蒙特利尔看望她的那一两次同时
as I made one or two visits
to see her in Montreal.

1534
01:16:39,563 --> 01:16:41,723
那两次看望 我和她做爱了
During those visits, I made love to her,

1535
01:16:41,864 --> 01:16:44,662
似乎又找回了激情
and there was something
of a renewal of the passion

1536
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,962
感觉就像我们刚刚在一起一样
we felt when we first lived together.

1537
01:16:47,804 --> 01:16:50,671
戴安肯定是吓了一跳 我猜
Diane must have been
taken aback, I would guess.

1538
01:16:50,807 --> 01:16:52,537
哈利一定提议过
Harry must have proposed

1539
01:16:52,677 --> 01:16:54,406
说他们应该一起住
that they live together at some point,

1540
01:16:54,545 --> 01:16:56,912
她一定在我们之间挣扎过
and she must have been torn between us,

1541
01:16:57,647 --> 01:16:59,581
因为我似乎突然又变成了
since I suddenly seemed to be

1542
01:16:59,716 --> 01:17:03,153
她曾经深爱的那个迈克尔
the old Michael
that she once loved so much.

1543
01:17:04,488 --> 01:17:06,514
“爱情这么短”
"Love is so short,

1544
01:17:07,191 --> 01:17:11,026
“遗忘那么长”，聂鲁达的诗这么说
"forgetting so long," Neruda wrote.

1545
01:17:16,668 --> 01:17:19,296
哈利当时一定很失望
Harry must have been very disappointed

1546
01:17:19,438 --> 01:17:21,531
当她回到多伦多的时候
when she returned to Toronto,

1547
01:17:21,673 --> 01:17:23,232
我也很遗憾
and I'm sorry for that.

1548
01:17:24,278 --> 01:17:26,575
但她确实回来了
But return to Toronto she did,

1549
01:17:26,713 --> 01:17:30,809
我们三个又和她继续快乐的生活
and the three of us were happy
to have her with us again.

1550
01:17:30,950 --> 01:17:33,714
然后她发现自己怀孕了
And then came the discovery
that she was pregnant.

1551
01:17:34,487 --> 01:17:36,785
对我来说 这是开心的好事
For me, it was joyful.

1552
01:17:36,923 --> 01:17:39,449
而她一定感到很烦恼
For her, it must have been agonizing.

1553
01:17:40,394 --> 01:17:42,157
你看 这一切的痛苦
Look, the terrible thing

1554
01:17:42,296 --> 01:17:44,787
她承受的所有的精神压力
about all the mental anguish she underwent

1555
01:17:44,932 --> 01:17:48,231
就是她不知道我会作何反应
was that she never understood
what my reaction would have been

1556
01:17:48,369 --> 01:17:50,200
假如她把一切都告诉我
if she'd told me the whole story.

1557
01:17:50,337 --> 01:17:52,931
我相信当时我会告诉她不用担心
I do believe I would have
told her not to worry,

1558
01:17:53,073 --> 01:17:54,939
我也准备好去接受
and that I was quite ready to accept

1559
01:17:55,076 --> 01:17:57,272
做一个可能是也可能不是的爸爸
the ambiguity of the parentage.

1560
01:17:58,547 --> 01:18:00,981
但再一次地 我失败了
But here again, I had failed.

1561
01:18:01,717 --> 01:18:04,276
为什么我们一直有谈心
Why is it that we talk and talk,

1562
01:18:04,418 --> 01:18:06,649
或者至少我有在谈
or at least I certainly do,

1563
01:18:06,788 --> 01:18:09,781
而无法表达自己真实的想法？
without somehow conveying
what we're really like?

1564
01:18:14,764 --> 01:18:17,325
一开始是什么驱使你写出
So what compelled you
initially to want to write

1565
01:18:17,468 --> 01:18:19,401
自己角度上看的这个故事？
your version of the story?

1566
01:18:20,303 --> 01:18:21,531
我当时在考虑...
Well, I was contemplating...

1567
01:18:21,671 --> 01:18:23,832
已经考虑了一段时间了
I had been contemplating for some time...

1568
01:18:25,142 --> 01:18:26,609
写一本自传
writing a memoir.

1569
01:18:26,743 --> 01:18:29,838
我认为这是个很好的故事
I became persuaded
that this was a strong story,

1570
01:18:29,981 --> 01:18:31,607
可以用很多方式来叙述
which could be told
in many different ways,

1571
01:18:31,748 --> 01:18:34,616
它有很好的结构
but which had
a very, very strong structure,

1572
01:18:34,752 --> 01:18:36,878
因为它有一个整整30年的空白
because it skipped a 30-year period

1573
01:18:37,020 --> 01:18:38,578
一代人的空白
and skipped a generation.

1574
01:18:38,722 --> 01:18:41,817
有一种特别的力量 一种连续的感觉
That it had a particular strength
and a sense of continuity

1575
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:43,792
遵循回忆 而又
with respect to memory and moving forward

1576
01:18:43,929 --> 01:18:45,725
不断地发展着
from one situation to another.

1577
01:18:45,864 --> 01:18:49,164
所以这是一个充满着大喜大悲的故事
That it was a story
with great sadness and great joy.

1578
01:18:49,301 --> 01:18:53,236
你也建议说我们可以在多伦多见个面
And you suggested at one point
when we met in Toronto

1579
01:18:53,371 --> 01:18:56,398
我们可以分头写自己版本的故事
that we each write our version of it,

1580
01:18:56,542 --> 01:18:58,874
最后给对方看自己的
and then we would show it to each other at the end

1581
01:18:59,011 --> 01:19:00,808
或许会有所帮助
and might do something with it,

1582
01:19:00,946 --> 01:19:04,007
但故事是开放性结局
but that was left pretty open-ended.

1583
01:19:04,150 --> 01:19:07,847
所以后来我写了一篇6页长的概要
So then I subsequently did
write the six-page summary

1584
01:19:07,988 --> 01:19:10,319
关于戴安和我们见面的背景情况
of the background
with Diane and us meeting.

1585
01:19:10,456 --> 01:19:11,685
哈利写了一篇文章
Harry had written a piece

1586
01:19:11,825 --> 01:19:14,385
关于他和你还有戴安的关系
about his relationship
with you and Diane

1587
01:19:14,528 --> 01:19:17,521
以及和你是如何父女相认的
and the discovery
that you are father and daughter,

1588
01:19:17,665 --> 01:19:20,155
有人建议他拿去发表
and someone suggested that he publish it.

1589
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:22,394
你反应十分激烈...
You reacted very, very strongly...

1590
01:19:22,537 --> 01:19:23,697
非常非常激烈
very, very strongly to it.

1591
01:19:23,838 --> 01:19:27,069
非常生气 难过
You were enraged,
and you were very upset.

1592
01:19:27,208 --> 01:19:28,232
嗨 哈利
Hi there, Harry.

1593
01:19:28,376 --> 01:19:30,777
我想我仍旧很困惑 关于你为什么如此坚持
I suppose I'm confused as to why
it's such a pressing issue for you

1594
01:19:30,913 --> 01:19:33,176
想要把这个故事公之于众
that this story be public
when it is already known

1595
01:19:33,314 --> 01:19:35,715
它已经被我们爱的人 爱我们的人了解了
by everyone we love
and everyone who loves us.

1596
01:19:36,785 --> 01:19:38,376
我也说了 我父亲仍旧需要时间
As I said, while my dad
has had some time

1597
01:19:38,519 --> 01:19:39,544
来接受这个消息
to deal with the news,

1598
01:19:39,688 --> 01:19:40,814
他还没有告诉他的朋友们
he has not yet had to tell his friends

1599
01:19:40,956 --> 01:19:44,120
也没有回答任何直系亲属以外的人的问题
or answer any questions from anyone
outside of his immediate family.

1600
01:19:45,794 --> 01:19:47,728
个人空间和隐私对他来说很重要
This space and privacy has
been important for him,

1601
01:19:47,863 --> 01:19:50,298
我也会坚持尽可能久地保护他的这些权利
and I believe strongly in protecting that
for as long as possible.

1602
01:19:50,433 --> 01:19:54,335
对我来说 这情况跟过去很像
In my case, it goes back
to a somewhat parallel situation

1603
01:19:54,470 --> 01:19:56,097
我和戴安交往的时候
during my relationship with Diane,

1604
01:19:56,239 --> 01:19:58,503
她的朋友都知道
which was open to her friends,

1605
01:19:58,641 --> 01:20:00,939
但其实是完全不公开的
but in fact was utterly constrained

1606
01:20:01,077 --> 01:20:03,672
因为她当时还是已婚妇人
by the reality of her marital situation.

1607
01:20:03,814 --> 01:20:06,611
当时我觉得很压抑
And I found that at the time oppressive.

1608
01:20:06,749 --> 01:20:09,878
我觉得这次我感到了一样的...
I guess I have felt
in this sort of a bit of a...

1609
01:20:10,654 --> 01:20:11,882
像回响
an echo.

1610
01:20:12,022 --> 01:20:15,617
我觉得压制、抑郁
I felt constrained, inhibited,

1611
01:20:15,759 --> 01:20:19,217
困在了我和你这样的关系里
and sort of pinched
in my relationship to you

1612
01:20:19,363 --> 01:20:22,993
因为我们认为这是一件私事
because of the private way
in which we were dealing with it.

1613
01:20:23,134 --> 01:20:24,964
气氛变得有些沉重
The atmosphere got a little heavy there.

1614
01:20:25,937 --> 01:20:28,405
变得沉重是因为
It got heavy because
we were sort of building

1615
01:20:28,541 --> 01:20:30,339
我们是在误解上增加误解
misunderstanding
on top of misunderstanding,

1616
01:20:30,476 --> 01:20:34,241
在误解方面我们还都挺厉害的
and we both proved to be
very capable in that respect.

1617
01:20:34,379 --> 01:20:37,577
我们之间变成这样 我很难过
I was upset that this thing
had gotten up between us.

1618
01:20:37,717 --> 01:20:39,617
我想要继续写的念头
My taste or desire
to do it at that point

1619
01:20:39,752 --> 01:20:41,481
已经不在了
really was no longer there.

1620
01:20:42,188 --> 01:20:45,386
“这没什么意思了 只是在引来麻烦事”
"This is not fun anymore.
It's just creating problems. "

1621
01:20:45,525 --> 01:20:49,621
所以最终 我放弃了 我退了一步
So eventually, I dropped it,
and I backed off.

1622
01:20:49,763 --> 01:20:53,563
把这个故事出版对你有什么吸引力？
And what was it about having it
published that attracted you?

1623
01:20:54,835 --> 01:20:55,961
我觉得...
Well, I think...

1624
01:20:56,103 --> 01:20:58,002
我觉得一个写东西的人...
I think anyone who writes anything...

1625
01:20:58,137 --> 01:21:03,236
或者做任何创作的人 都会想要公开自己的作品
Anyone who does anything
wants to bring it out to the public.

1626
01:21:03,978 --> 01:21:06,104
如果有一个好故事
If there's a story to be told,

1627
01:21:06,246 --> 01:21:09,410
是一个合乎情理的 能让人产生共鸣的故事
and if the story has some validity
and some resonance,

1628
01:21:10,151 --> 01:21:12,415
那么你不会想只留给自己
then you don't keep it to yourself.

1629
01:21:13,688 --> 01:21:15,714
有蜜月期
There was the honeymoon period,

1630
01:21:15,858 --> 01:21:18,326
也有困难时期
there was the difficult period,

1631
01:21:18,460 --> 01:21:22,294
我可以听出你们对话中的语气
when I would hear the tones
of voices on the exchanges,

1632
01:21:22,431 --> 01:21:23,625
有紧张感
that there was tension.

1633
01:21:23,766 --> 01:21:25,756
所以这样一个完美的父女关系
So this is in this perfect relationship,

1634
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:27,391
完美的爸爸 完美的女儿
the perfect papa,
the perfect daughter,

1635
01:21:27,536 --> 01:21:30,004
一切都很完美 却变得不完美了
everything's perfect,
and it's no longer perfect.

1636
01:21:30,139 --> 01:21:31,198
嗨 哈利
Hi there, Harry.

1637
01:21:31,975 --> 01:21:34,000
我还是感到很不舒服
I'm just extremely uncomfortable
at being involved

1638
01:21:34,144 --> 01:21:35,236
来这样讲这个故事
in the telling of this story

1639
01:21:35,378 --> 01:21:37,573
除非它有一个全局观
unless it includes the whole picture,

1640
01:21:37,714 --> 01:21:40,011
也就是说 要有我的看法
which is to say my experience of it,

1641
01:21:40,150 --> 01:21:41,139
你的看法
your experience of it,

1642
01:21:41,284 --> 01:21:43,149
还有我的家人的
as well as my family's.

1643
01:22:01,038 --> 01:22:03,440
我考虑了很多 关于你想要讲述这个故事的愿望
I've been thinking a lot
about your desire to tell this story

1644
01:22:04,210 --> 01:22:06,973
同时我也想把这个故事拍成纪录片
and my own desire to document
this experience through film.

1645
01:22:08,381 --> 01:22:10,177
我开始筹备的同时
As I begin this process,

1646
01:22:10,315 --> 01:22:12,612
我其实不知道自己的电影会是什么形式
I don't know what form
my project will take.

1647
01:22:13,552 --> 01:22:16,282
我也不知道这是否是一个个人的记录
I don't know
if it's a personal record for myself,

1648
01:22:16,421 --> 01:22:17,583
或者说是拍成一部
or something to be made into a piece

1649
01:22:17,725 --> 01:22:19,453
给别人看的影片
for others to see at some point.

1650
01:22:20,126 --> 01:22:21,150
我不知道这需要花多久
I don't know how long it would take

1651
01:22:21,294 --> 01:22:22,853
或者甚至能否完成
or if it would ever get finished,

1652
01:22:24,098 --> 01:22:26,428
我也不会假装自己知道如何讲述它
and I wouldn't even pretend at this point
to know how to tell it,

1653
01:22:26,565 --> 01:22:27,555
在我进行对大家的
beyond beginning to explore it

1654
01:22:27,700 --> 01:22:29,463
采访和探索之前
through interviews
with everyone involved,

1655
01:22:30,303 --> 01:22:32,032
所以每个人的观点
so that everyone's point of view,

1656
01:22:32,171 --> 01:22:34,265
不管多么互相矛盾的话 都会被收录进来
no matter how contradictory, is included.

1657
01:22:36,077 --> 01:22:37,442
会有一天 它会成为
One day it may turn into a documentary

1658
01:22:37,579 --> 01:22:39,045
别人购买的纪录片
for others to consume.

1659
01:22:40,214 --> 01:22:42,910
我真的不确定那会是何时 或者说我是否愿意这样
I'm really not sure when
or if I'd want that to happen,

1660
01:22:44,084 --> 01:22:46,177
但不管结果如何
but whatever it ended up being,

1661
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:48,915
影片中没有你会非常奇怪
it would feel very odd
not to have you be a part of this.

1662
01:22:57,066 --> 01:22:59,157
他在考虑这部纪录片的时候
When he considers this documentary,

1663
01:22:59,299 --> 01:23:01,097
他是哈利 一个制片人
being Harry, being a producer,

1664
01:23:01,236 --> 01:23:04,173
我肯定他对于这部电影会有一些不安
I'm sure there's a little bit
of trepidation about this film,

1665
01:23:04,307 --> 01:23:06,672
因为他对所有的事情没有掌控权
because he doesn't have
control of everything.

1666
01:23:06,809 --> 01:23:09,005
他明白 但也不喜欢这样
He understands that. He doesn't like it.

1667
01:23:09,146 --> 01:23:12,046
事先已经跟他说明了 这次的故事
It's been made clear to him
that this story will be told

1668
01:23:12,181 --> 01:23:14,047
会从所有人的角度来讲述
from the points of view of everyone

1669
01:23:14,183 --> 01:23:15,775
只要是活着的 愿意讲述的人
who is alive who can talk about it,

1670
01:23:15,918 --> 01:23:18,113
我父亲真的只想拍
and my dad would really like it just to be

1671
01:23:18,254 --> 01:23:20,985
他遇见戴安 和她在一起的日子
about his story of meeting
Diane and being with her

1672
01:23:21,124 --> 01:23:23,184
以及有了你 和现在再次遇见你
and having you
and meeting you again.

1673
01:23:23,327 --> 01:23:24,816
但是他接受了
But he's going along with it.

1674
01:23:24,961 --> 01:23:26,360
试着好好融入
He's trying to be a good sport.

1675
01:23:26,496 --> 01:23:28,021
你的看法是如何的呢
So what do you think of the concept

1676
01:23:28,166 --> 01:23:30,327
关于我拍的这部纪录片
of me making this documentary

1677
01:23:30,468 --> 01:23:35,167
给每个人平等的机会 来叙述他们眼中的故事
where we're giving equal weight
to everyone's version of the story?

1678
01:23:35,306 --> 01:23:36,968
我不喜欢这样
I don't like it.

1679
01:23:37,109 --> 01:23:41,739
我觉得这会让我们...
I think that takes us into...

1680
01:23:42,981 --> 01:23:44,414
仿佛陷入厚厚的羊毛
into very woolly...

1681
01:23:44,549 --> 01:23:47,848
任何一方面都无法深入探讨了
You can't ever
touch bottom with anything then.

1682
01:23:48,653 --> 01:23:50,919
什么方面都有涉及
We're all over the place.

1683
01:23:51,057 --> 01:23:52,956
他们的看法都能展现出来
I think they can all be heard.

1684
01:23:53,091 --> 01:23:56,084
但给他们同等的权利...
It's giving them equal weight
which I find...

1685
01:23:56,229 --> 01:23:59,197
尤其是那些没有直接关系的人
Particularly those
who are non-players.

1686
01:23:59,331 --> 01:24:02,859
首先 是那些对事件有影响的人
First of all, there are
the parties to an incident...

1687
01:24:03,002 --> 01:24:04,229
他们当时在场
those who were there

1688
01:24:04,369 --> 01:24:06,463
也受到了直接的影响
and who were directly affected by it.

1689
01:24:06,606 --> 01:24:08,972
然后还有周围的一圈人
Then there is a circle around that

1690
01:24:09,108 --> 01:24:11,542
他们受到了间接的影响
of people who were affected tangentially

1691
01:24:11,678 --> 01:24:14,978
因为他们和第一批人有联系
because of their relationship
to the principal parties.

1692
01:24:15,115 --> 01:24:18,515
再然后还有一圈人
And then there's another concentric circle
further out there

1693
01:24:18,652 --> 01:24:20,813
基本上是听说过
which basically has heard or been told

1694
01:24:20,955 --> 01:24:23,014
从第一群人的某一个人口中听说
by one of the principal players about it,

1695
01:24:23,157 --> 01:24:26,126
这些人会有不同的叙述
and all of these may have
different narratives,

1696
01:24:26,260 --> 01:24:28,729
这些叙述会受到影响
and these narratives are shaped

1697
01:24:28,864 --> 01:24:30,923
受到他们和告知人关系的影响
in part by their relationship to the person

1698
01:24:31,066 --> 01:24:33,534
告知他们的人 和场合
who told it to them and by the events.

1699
01:24:33,668 --> 01:24:35,465
一个人是无法得知真相的
One does not get the truth

1700
01:24:35,604 --> 01:24:38,129
假如仅仅是看他们的反应的话
simply by hearing what their reactions are.

1701
01:24:38,273 --> 01:24:41,174
人们会根据自己的观察表达观点
People tend to declare themselves
in terms of what they saw,

1702
01:24:41,309 --> 01:24:42,572
还会根据自己的感受
in terms of what they felt,

1703
01:24:42,712 --> 01:24:44,339
以及他们自己的记忆
in terms of what they remembered,

1704
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:46,208
还有他们都忠心于谁
and in terms of their loyalties.

1705
01:24:46,348 --> 01:24:49,079
同样的状况
The same set of circumstances

1706
01:24:49,218 --> 01:24:52,120
对不同的人会造成不同的影响
will affect different people
in different ways.

1707
01:24:52,256 --> 01:24:53,779
而并不是说有不同的真相
Not that there are different truths.

1708
01:24:53,923 --> 01:24:57,325
对特定的事件 大家的反应会不同
There are different reactions
to particular events.

1709
01:24:58,794 --> 01:25:01,093
艺术作品的关键作用就是道出真相
The crucial function of art
is to tell the truth,

1710
01:25:01,231 --> 01:25:02,823
发现事件中的真相
to find the truth in a situation.

1711
01:25:02,966 --> 01:25:04,762
就是这个道理
That's what it's about.

1712
01:25:07,538 --> 01:25:10,507
你会发现 当你拍完这部片...
You realize, when you've finished all this...

1713
01:25:13,744 --> 01:25:15,838
你会发现 当你拍完以后
You realize, when you've finished all this,

1714
01:25:17,015 --> 01:25:20,507
会有大约6小时的素材
you've got about six hours of stuff,

1715
01:25:21,352 --> 01:25:23,982
你就要决定选取哪些
and you'll decide what you want out of it.

1716
01:25:25,223 --> 01:25:26,884
过程就像这个故事本身一样了
It'll be exactly like the story.

1717
01:25:27,025 --> 01:25:29,017
我们每个人都会选取...
Each one of us will pick out...

1718
01:25:29,695 --> 01:25:31,855
假如我们之中有人来剪辑的话
If any one of us were trying to edit it

1719
01:25:31,996 --> 01:25:33,965
决定保留哪些材料
and decide what we wanted to keep,

1720
01:25:35,067 --> 01:25:36,898
那会和戏剧作品一样
it would be the same farcical kind

1721
01:25:37,036 --> 01:25:40,700
充满滑稽的
of theatrical exercise
that we're all involved in.

1722
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:42,067
“噢，这段我要留着”
"Oh, I want to keep that. "

1723
01:25:42,207 --> 01:25:43,971
“噢 那句是废话”
"Oh, that's rubbish. "

1724
01:25:44,110 --> 01:25:46,043
这会完全不同于
That's an enormously different thing

1725
01:25:46,178 --> 01:25:49,342
普通的采访
from simply doing an interview straight

1726
01:25:49,482 --> 01:25:52,474
而不必去剪辑什么的
and never doing any editing of it whatsoever,

1727
01:25:52,619 --> 01:25:54,087
是怎样就是怎样
but letting it run as it is.

1728
01:25:54,221 --> 01:25:58,452
那至少会让你尽可能地接近真实本身
That would have been at least
as close to truth as you can get,

1729
01:25:58,591 --> 01:26:01,117
而你进行剪辑以后
whereas your editing of this

1730
01:26:01,262 --> 01:26:03,628
会把这片子变得完全不同
will turn this into something
completely different.

1731
01:26:04,532 --> 01:26:07,092
你觉得 这部纪录片的真正意义是什么？
What would you say
this documentary is really about?

1732
01:26:09,404 --> 01:26:11,372
我这是在打破第四道墙吗？（指和观众互动）
Am I breaking the fourth wall here?

1733
01:26:11,506 --> 01:26:12,734
把摄影机转过去
Turn the camera around.

1734
01:26:15,277 --> 01:26:16,574
意义是什么？
What is it about?

1735
01:26:16,712 --> 01:26:18,076
我觉得有很多含义
I feel like it's about a lot of things.

1736
01:26:19,915 --> 01:26:21,143
回忆 你说过
Memory, you said.

1737
01:26:21,283 --> 01:26:24,150
关于回忆和我们讲述自己生活的方式
Memory and the way
we tell the stories of our lives.

1738
01:26:24,287 --> 01:26:29,555
很多时候就像 我们可以通过讲述
I think in many ways it's like
trying to bring someone to life

1739
01:26:29,693 --> 01:26:31,625
让逝去的人复生
through people's stories of them.

1740
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:33,752
我的拍摄角度怎么样？
Is this a good angle for me?

1741
01:26:35,531 --> 01:26:36,555
不好意思 继续
Sorry, go on.

1742
01:26:38,266 --> 01:26:39,291
告诉人们什么？
Telling people what?

1743
01:26:39,435 --> 01:26:40,460
混蛋
Asshole.

1744
01:26:41,872 --> 01:26:43,033
嗨 哈利
Hi, Harry.

1745
01:26:43,174 --> 01:26:44,868
这部纪录片的重点之一是
One of the main focuses in the documentary

1746
01:26:45,009 --> 01:26:46,874
各种叙述之间的差异
are the discrepancies in the stories.

1747
01:26:47,010 --> 01:26:50,139
所有人 你 我 我父亲 我的哥哥姐姐们
All of us... you, me, my dad, my siblings,

1748
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:52,247
妈妈的朋友们 等等
my mother's friends, et cetera...

1749
01:26:52,383 --> 01:26:55,683
故事大体相同 却有着大大小小的细节上的差异
have similar stories
with large and small details that vary.

1750
01:26:55,820 --> 01:26:58,414
我对大家不同的叙述生活的方式很感兴趣
I'm interested in the way
we tell stories about our lives,

1751
01:26:59,190 --> 01:27:01,454
事实就是如此 过去发生的真实 都很易逝
about the fact that the truth
about the past is often ephemeral

1752
01:27:01,594 --> 01:27:03,686
很难有定论
and difficult to pin down,

1753
01:27:03,828 --> 01:27:05,920
并且很多故事 假如我们不花时间
and many of our stories,
when we don't take proper time

1754
01:27:06,063 --> 01:27:07,326
去好好审视过去
to do research about our pasts,

1755
01:27:07,465 --> 01:27:09,831
大多数时候都会是这样
which is almost always the case,

1756
01:27:09,968 --> 01:27:12,233
最终里面就会有偏差和虚构
end up with shifts and fictions in them,

1757
01:27:12,371 --> 01:27:13,702
大多数都是无意的
mostly unintended.

1758
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:16,233
和妈妈的关系
In relation to Mom,

1759
01:27:16,376 --> 01:27:19,173
我想 当我们以一家人的身份聊起来
I think when we talk about it as a family,

1760
01:27:19,311 --> 01:27:22,075
似乎就会有很多
there seems to be this... this kind of...

1761
01:27:22,214 --> 01:27:23,841
关于“她是谁”的问题
a lot of questions about who was she.

1762
01:27:23,983 --> 01:27:25,473
会有很多不同的看法
You know, a lot of disagreement

1763
01:27:25,618 --> 01:27:27,382
关于她是怎样一个人
about what kind of a person she was,

1764
01:27:27,521 --> 01:27:30,320
就会产生误解 觉得她是某种“东西”
and there's this misconception
that she was some thing,

1765
01:27:30,458 --> 01:27:33,392
我想对我来说 这又是一种误解
and I guess that to me
is another misconception...

1766
01:27:33,527 --> 01:27:35,758
关于婚外情的
that there is a state of affairs

1767
01:27:35,897 --> 01:27:37,921
或者其他真的发生了的事
or a thing that actually happened,

1768
01:27:38,064 --> 01:27:41,228
我们得重新模拟当时到底发生了什么
and we have to reconstruct
exactly what happened in the past,

1769
01:27:41,368 --> 01:27:43,930
我觉得 其实没有一个“当时真的发生了什么”的概念
and I don't think there ever was
a "what actually happened. "

1770
01:27:44,073 --> 01:27:45,733
我觉得从一开始
I think there were lots of perspectives

1771
01:27:45,873 --> 01:27:47,033
就有很多观察
from the very beginning.

1772
01:27:47,175 --> 01:27:48,837
永远不会有答案
You don't ever get to an answer.

1773
01:27:48,977 --> 01:27:51,172
永远不能说出“好 我们弄明白了”
You don't ever get to,
"Okay, now we've figured it out.

1774
01:27:51,313 --> 01:27:52,904
“我们明白当时到底发生什么了”
"We know exactly what happened,

1775
01:27:53,047 --> 01:27:54,708
“我们了解她到底是怎样一个人了”
"we know exactly what kind of person she was. "

1776
01:27:54,849 --> 01:27:57,284
这些都是很虚幻的
I think those things are just illusory.

1777
01:27:58,053 --> 01:28:00,317
再一次地 说到这些基本的问题
Again, in terms of the basic question,

1778
01:28:01,156 --> 01:28:02,920
“一个人能获知真相吗？”
"Can one get at the truth?"

1779
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:07,425
你当然能非常接近真相
You can certainly get very close to it,

1780
01:28:07,564 --> 01:28:11,499
但真相必须仅限于跟事情有关系的人们
but you have to limit it to those
who are involved in the events...

1781
01:28:11,633 --> 01:28:13,158
有直接关系的 受直接影响的
directly involved and affected...

1782
01:28:13,303 --> 01:28:17,070
之间的直接目击者只有两个
and the direct witnesses
to the events are only two,

1783
01:28:17,208 --> 01:28:18,606
其中一个已经不在了
and one is not around.

1784
01:28:21,212 --> 01:28:22,440
戴安不能在这里说什么了
Diane's not here to talk to.

1785
01:28:22,580 --> 01:28:25,070
她真的是唯一一个
That's really the only person who could provide

1786
01:28:25,215 --> 01:28:28,083
可以说出真正发生了什么的人
the essence, the essentials of what took place.

1787
01:28:30,655 --> 01:28:32,679
我们经历了那么多争辩
So we went through all of that debate,

1788
01:28:32,823 --> 01:28:35,918
终于昨天我们可以开始拍了
and then we started here yesterday.

1789
01:28:36,061 --> 01:28:39,497
我感觉 我们之间的那些迷雾 已经消散了
I somehow feel that we've
cleared up some of the smoke.

1790
01:28:39,631 --> 01:28:42,531
或许不是全部的 但部分的迷雾 已经消失了
Maybe not all, but some of the smoke
has been cleared away.

1791
01:28:43,969 --> 01:28:47,871
事实是 本质上来说 这是和戴安的故事
The reality is, essentially,
that the story with Diane,

1792
01:28:48,006 --> 01:28:51,567
我很遗憾要这么说 但这故事只能我来讲
I regret to say, is only mine to tell,

1793
01:28:53,479 --> 01:28:54,878
这是事实
and I think that's a fact.

1794
01:28:59,352 --> 01:29:02,880
我的回忆不会一直都很精确
Now, my recollections
may be faulty at times,

1795
01:29:03,023 --> 01:29:04,217
但我不会说谎
but I'm not gonna lie.

1796
01:29:06,325 --> 01:29:09,193
我和戴安30年前的爱情
The love that I shared
with Diane 30 years ago

1797
01:29:09,329 --> 01:29:12,389
很热烈 又恒久
was so intense and so lasting,

1798
01:29:12,533 --> 01:29:13,830
这些感觉都回来了
it all came back to me

1799
01:29:13,967 --> 01:29:16,333
因为我对你的感情 融合了这些
and got wrapped up
with my affection for you.

1800
01:29:21,175 --> 01:29:24,339
所以我对你的爱 是一样的
So I became crazy
about you in the same way.

1801
01:30:07,357 --> 01:30:08,950
当我听说
When I heard the full details

1802
01:30:09,093 --> 01:30:10,958
妈妈和哈利婚外情的全部细节之后
of the affair between Mom and Harry,

1803
01:30:11,095 --> 01:30:13,893
我真的很高兴 因为我一直觉得
I was really happy because I've always felt

1804
01:30:15,333 --> 01:30:17,895
她这一辈子都在寻找真爱
like she spent her whole life looking for love,

1805
01:30:18,037 --> 01:30:23,167
我当然能感觉出 她生命的最后几年里
and I certainly felt
that in the last years of her life,

1806
01:30:23,308 --> 01:30:26,299
很多年以来 从我还是个孩子时候起
and for a long time
ever since I was a child,

1807
01:30:26,444 --> 01:30:29,380
从爸爸身上 她真的没有得到她想要的
she really hadn't gotten
from Dad what she needed.

1808
01:30:29,514 --> 01:30:32,541
当我听说哈利的事情以后
And when I heard the story of Harry...

1809
01:30:34,153 --> 01:30:35,415
我感觉...
I remember feeling...

1810
01:30:36,889 --> 01:30:41,485
非常开心 因为她找到了爱情
feeling really happy
that she had found love

1811
01:30:41,628 --> 01:30:44,062
有一个人如此地爱过她
and that she'd been loved that much.

1812
01:30:53,773 --> 01:30:56,538
但我其实也觉得
But I kind of think Dad

1813
01:30:56,677 --> 01:30:58,541
爸爸是她真正爱过的人
was the one she really was in love with,

1814
01:30:58,678 --> 01:31:01,273
但他真的不是个好的选择
and he just wasn't an option,

1815
01:31:01,415 --> 01:31:03,908
所以我真的很开心 有人爱过她
so I'm really glad that she was loved.

1816
01:31:04,053 --> 01:31:06,247
我不确定 那个爱她的人
I'm not sure she was loved by the person

1817
01:31:06,388 --> 01:31:08,687
是不是她真正想要他去爱她的那个人
she really wanted to be loved by, but...

1818
01:31:34,384 --> 01:31:37,479
亲爱的萨拉 你在拍摄这部纪录片
My dear Sarah,
when you make a documentary

1819
01:31:37,622 --> 01:31:40,181
关于自己发现自己的生父的故事
about your own discovery
of a new father,

1820
01:31:40,324 --> 01:31:43,919
你这么做是不是为了避免自己内心的担忧
are you doing so to avoid
your own deeper concerns

1821
01:31:44,061 --> 01:31:45,995
关于此事对你真正产生的影响？
of its real impact on you?

1822
01:31:46,963 --> 01:31:48,294
所以你才把它描述为
Is that why you describe it

1823
01:31:48,432 --> 01:31:51,198
寻找多种多样的真相
as a search for the vagaries of truth

1824
01:31:51,337 --> 01:31:53,736
和回忆的不可靠性
and the unreliability of memory,

1825
01:31:53,871 --> 01:31:56,033
而不是去寻找父亲？
rather than a search for a father?

1826
01:31:58,775 --> 01:32:00,038
嘿 爸爸
Hey, Dad.

1827
01:32:00,178 --> 01:32:02,339
收到你的上一封邮件 我想了很多
I've been thinking a lot about your last email.

1828
01:32:03,781 --> 01:32:04,806
或许你是对的
Maybe you're right.

1829
01:32:06,085 --> 01:32:07,484
或许我拍摄这部电影的真正原因
Maybe there is something
underneath my need

1830
01:32:07,619 --> 01:32:09,349
我是有所隐瞒的
to make this film
that I've been denying.

1831
01:32:10,990 --> 01:32:13,184
每次我感觉自己有了立足点 最终都会丢失
Every time I feel I have my footing, I lose it.

1832
01:32:14,127 --> 01:32:17,152
我也不知道自己为什么让大家如此坦白
I can't figure out
why I'm exposing us all in this way.

1833
01:32:18,130 --> 01:32:20,361
说实话 真的很尴尬
It's really embarrassing, to be honest.

1834
01:32:21,901 --> 01:32:23,096
我是疯了吗
Have I totally lost my mind,

1835
01:32:23,237 --> 01:32:25,670
试着用其他人的叙述来重塑过去？
trying to reconstruct the past
from other people's words?

1836
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:28,833
来找回妈妈？
Trying to form her?

1837
01:32:30,311 --> 01:32:32,540
她走之后 产生的像是海啸
Is this the tsunami
she unleashed when she went,

1838
01:32:33,346 --> 01:32:35,679
我们还在她身后挥舞
and all of us still flailing in her wake,

1839
01:32:36,450 --> 01:32:38,884
试着在残骸中把她找回来
trying to put her together
in the wreckage,

1840
01:32:39,019 --> 01:32:42,854
而她一次又一次地在我们眼前消失
and her slipping away from us,
over and over again,

1841
01:32:42,991 --> 01:32:44,788
每次当我们快要看见她的时候
just as we begin to see her face?

1842
01:32:49,363 --> 01:32:51,832
妈妈去世的那天 你还记得什么？
What do you remember
of the day Mom died?

1843
01:33:00,041 --> 01:33:01,976
多可怕的一天啊 不是吗？
That was a terrible day, wasn't it?

1844
01:33:04,212 --> 01:33:05,839
我不知道 我想...
I don't know. I guess...

1845
01:33:06,649 --> 01:33:08,981
她的哥哥对我们说
I guess her brother had said to us,

1846
01:33:09,118 --> 01:33:11,178
“差不多就是这样了...”
"Well, it's almost the end now, and... "

1847
01:33:15,325 --> 01:33:17,020
“你们大家都应该去...”
"I think each one of you should go... "

1848
01:33:17,161 --> 01:33:19,356
她当时没有意识
I mean, she was unconscious.

1849
01:33:20,730 --> 01:33:22,289
“说点什么...”
"And say whatever...

1850
01:33:25,869 --> 01:33:30,307
“在她去世之前 说点最后的话”
"Whatever final words
you have to say to her before she goes...

1851
01:33:31,708 --> 01:33:33,700
“因为这真的是最后的时刻了”
"because it's very close to the end. "

1852
01:33:36,914 --> 01:33:38,382
真是糟糕的一天
So that was a bad day.

1853
01:33:47,326 --> 01:33:48,520
你对她说了什么？
What did you say to her?

1854
01:33:48,661 --> 01:33:49,650
什么？
What?

1855
01:33:49,795 --> 01:33:51,626
当时我们都有和她独处的时间
With that time that we
each had alone with her,

1856
01:33:51,764 --> 01:33:53,197
你对她说了什么？
what did you say to her?

1857
01:34:03,243 --> 01:34:04,403
我不知道
Don't know.

1858
01:34:05,478 --> 01:34:06,878
大概说了 我会想念她
Probably that I'd missed her...

1859
01:34:07,013 --> 01:34:08,811
我会想念她
that I would miss her,

1860
01:34:08,950 --> 01:34:10,178
我爱她
that I loved her, and that...

1861
01:34:11,818 --> 01:34:13,342
永远不会忘记她
would never forget her.

1862
01:34:14,020 --> 01:34:15,545
就这些
That's about all.

1863
01:34:54,163 --> 01:34:57,896
这样一个 你了解她有25年的人
You know, somebody you've known
for 25 years...

1864
01:35:00,069 --> 01:35:02,664
这25年间你的大部分人生都和她在一起
and spent much of your life
with for 25 years,

1865
01:35:02,806 --> 01:35:08,438
人生的意义都奉献给她
and has given your life
much of its meaning for 25 years,

1866
01:35:08,579 --> 01:35:10,171
失去这样的人 太难了
awful hard to lose them.

1867
01:36:21,957 --> 01:36:23,857
这问题真是太难受了
That's a dire line of questioning.

1868
01:36:23,993 --> 01:36:27,953
告诉你 我们必须把这片子弄得开心点
I tell you, we must find a way
of making it more funny.

1869
01:36:31,602 --> 01:36:34,935
你怎么成了个虐待狂采访人了
What are you, some kind
of sadistic interviewer?

1870
01:36:37,641 --> 01:36:39,404
是你说我该让你情绪崩溃的
You told me
I had to break you down more.

1871
01:36:39,542 --> 01:36:41,772
是啊 你做到了 不是吗？
Yeah, well, you've done it, haven't you?

1872
01:36:41,911 --> 01:36:44,381
刚才可没有任何表演成分
There was no acting in any of that.

1873
01:36:48,252 --> 01:36:49,481
没有任何表演成分
No acting at all.

1874
01:36:49,621 --> 01:36:52,054
你看你是个多狠毒的导演啊
You see what a vicious director you are.

1875
01:36:52,956 --> 01:36:54,549
现在你该明白了吧
Now you understand, don't you?

1876
01:36:54,692 --> 01:36:56,250
我还记得
I remember that...

1877
01:36:56,394 --> 01:36:58,487
那天 你指导我表演
remember that day when you directed me

1878
01:36:58,630 --> 01:37:01,827
你当时在拍一个多荒谬的短片
in a ridiculous montage piece
that you were doing

1879
01:37:01,967 --> 01:37:03,265
当时你还在电影中心的时候
when you were at the film center,

1880
01:37:03,403 --> 01:37:07,533
你让我走到一个冰冷的游泳池里
and you made me walk down
into a pool of freezing cold water,

1881
01:37:07,674 --> 01:37:09,573
还穿着很多衣服
wearing full clothes.

1882
01:37:09,708 --> 01:37:11,800
“继续走 再往下一点 爸爸！”
"Keep going, further down, Dad!"

1883
01:37:11,943 --> 01:37:14,742
我说，“不能再往下了！”
I said, "I can't go any further down!

1884
01:37:14,881 --> 01:37:16,439
“我的衣服不方便”
"My clothes are holding me up. "

1885
01:37:16,583 --> 01:37:17,948
“往下就是了！”
"Just keep going down!

1886
01:37:18,085 --> 01:37:19,847
“天啊 真是烦人”
"God, it's so annoying.

1887
01:37:19,986 --> 01:37:21,887
“这只是个小小的要求”
"It's a very little thing to ask of you.

1888
01:37:22,022 --> 01:37:25,047
“我只是要你潜到水下一尺深而已”
"All I want you to do is
go a foot under the water.

1889
01:37:25,191 --> 01:37:27,056
“我现在要做个短片剪辑”
"Here I am trying to do a montage,

1890
01:37:27,193 --> 01:37:30,186
“而我的老爸却给我找麻烦”
"and my father is causing trouble. "

1891
01:37:30,330 --> 01:37:32,628
这导演真是惨无人道啊
A brutal piece of directing.

1892
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:34,624
为什么？
Why?

1893
01:37:40,909 --> 01:37:42,500
但某种程度来说
And in some ways, that's, you know...

1894
01:37:42,643 --> 01:37:46,102
所有的这些问题
that's why this whole question of...

1895
01:37:49,084 --> 01:37:51,053
“我是你的父亲吗？或者不是？”
"Was I your father? Wasn't I?"

1896
01:37:55,558 --> 01:37:59,755
似乎变得不是很重要了
It becomes sort of
an unimportant part of the past,

1897
01:37:59,894 --> 01:38:01,192
至少对我来说
for me, anyway.

1898
01:38:02,264 --> 01:38:03,994
我想对你来说重要得多
I think it's much more important for you.

1899
01:38:04,134 --> 01:38:05,464
对我来说 这件事只是
For me, it's just one of those things

1900
01:38:05,601 --> 01:38:07,626
人生中很平常的一件事
that happens along with life.

1901
01:38:09,206 --> 01:38:11,436
所以不要为我感到难过
So don't feel sorry for me.

1902
01:38:11,575 --> 01:38:13,668
如果要有什么遗憾 那也是哈利的
If you have pity, it should be for Harry,

1903
01:38:13,810 --> 01:38:15,470
他爱过戴安 却失去了她
who loved and lost Diane

1904
01:38:15,611 --> 01:38:17,410
然后又错过了自己的孩子萨拉
and then missed out on the childhood

1905
01:38:17,548 --> 01:38:19,708
她的童年生活
of that Sarah he had produced.

1906
01:38:19,850 --> 01:38:20,839
如果换做是我
Had that been my lot,

1907
01:38:20,984 --> 01:38:24,546
看到DNA结果的时候 我会非常难过
I would have been mortified
when I read that DNA result.

1908
01:38:24,689 --> 01:38:25,848
我是个非常幸运的人
I've been a very lucky man,

1909
01:38:25,989 --> 01:38:29,153
当然 我最幸运的时刻之一
and, of course, for one of my luckiest moments,

1910
01:38:29,293 --> 01:38:33,593
我要感谢哈利・加尔金爱过戴安
I have to thank Harry Gulkin for loving Diane.

1911
01:38:34,332 --> 01:38:38,167
因为他们的爱情 才有了今天的萨拉
Sarah's only what she is
because of that night of love

1912
01:38:38,303 --> 01:38:40,133
戴安和哈利的爱情结晶
between Diane and Harry.

1913
01:38:40,271 --> 01:38:42,900
如果她的父亲是我
Had I been her biological father,

1914
01:38:43,041 --> 01:38:45,168
她会是完全不同的人
she would have been entirely different.

1915
01:38:45,310 --> 01:38:47,471
她可能会更好 也可能更糟
She might have better or worse,

1916
01:38:47,613 --> 01:38:50,105
但她绝对不会是
but she would definitely not have been

1917
01:38:50,250 --> 01:38:52,240
今天的萨拉
the Sarah she is today,

1918
01:38:52,384 --> 01:38:54,079
我爱的这个萨拉
and that's the one I love.

1919
01:38:54,219 --> 01:38:57,621
还有其他的可能 就是什么都没有
Of the other possible outcome,
there's nothing.

1920
01:38:57,757 --> 01:39:00,055
你可以把这封信留给自己看
You may decide you want to keep
this letter to yourself

1921
01:39:00,193 --> 01:39:01,592
或者拿出来分享
or to share it.

1922
01:39:01,728 --> 01:39:03,822
这是你的东西 你的选择
It's yours, and yours the choice.

1923
01:39:04,799 --> 01:39:07,266
你看...
You know, look...

1924
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:09,392
爸 刚才那句能再念一遍吗？
Dad, can you just go back over that one line?

1925
01:39:09,537 --> 01:39:11,630
我的情感这么真挚
I was being so real.

1926
01:39:14,008 --> 01:39:16,340
自己都感动了
I completely convinced myself.

1927
01:39:18,413 --> 01:39:20,676
你可以把这封信留给自己看
You may decide you want
to keep this letter to yourself

1928
01:39:20,815 --> 01:39:22,009
或者拿出来分享
or to share it.

1929
01:39:22,149 --> 01:39:25,448
这是你的东西 你的选择
It's yours, and yours the choice.

1930
01:39:25,586 --> 01:39:30,251
你看 你那个礼拜四告诉我这个消息的时候
You know, look, while telling me
your news on Thursday,

1931
01:39:30,392 --> 01:39:31,859
你拥抱了我两次
you twice hugged me

1932
01:39:31,993 --> 01:39:34,929
就像你小时候抱着我一样
as hard as you ever did in your childhood.

1933
01:39:35,898 --> 01:39:40,630
那拥抱已经胜过千言万语
That alone made your revelation
worth a thousand words.

1934
01:39:41,604 --> 01:39:43,663
于是 就是这些了吧
So, there you have it.

1935
01:39:43,806 --> 01:39:45,397
我所知道的一切
All I know of what happened

1936
01:39:45,540 --> 01:39:48,374
或者别人告诉我的 我都说出来了
or what has been reported to me
has been told.

1937
01:39:49,046 --> 01:39:51,140
我想 我把这个故事写下来 因为它真的
I think I wrote this story
because it really says

1938
01:39:51,282 --> 01:39:55,047
展现了人们生命中有趣的部分
so many interesting things
about the human condition.

1939
01:39:55,185 --> 01:39:57,517
但或许还有其他原因
But maybe there was another reason.

1940
01:39:57,654 --> 01:39:59,348
或许 在内心深处
Perhaps, deep inside,

1941
01:39:59,488 --> 01:40:02,754
我比自己所承认的要承受了更多的震惊
I have suffered more of a shock
than I would openly admit.

1942
01:40:02,893 --> 01:40:07,524
我有时候会停下来 认识到自己内心深处
I sometimes stop and realize
that something inside

1943
01:40:07,665 --> 01:40:10,828
自己的余生都被改变了
has for the rest of my life changed.

1944
01:40:10,969 --> 01:40:14,735
萨拉和我之间的羁绊
A certain cord that runs
between Sarah and me

1945
01:40:14,873 --> 01:40:16,204
被隔断了
has been severed,

1946
01:40:16,341 --> 01:40:19,037
我无力再把它拼起来
and I am powerless to join it together.

1947
01:40:19,177 --> 01:40:20,805
它不是真切的事物
It's not a real thing.

1948
01:40:20,946 --> 01:40:23,313
它的存在是因为
It only exists because we have developed

1949
01:40:23,450 --> 01:40:26,042
我们的想象
this facet called imagination,

1950
01:40:26,184 --> 01:40:28,915
而那是真实而有形的
and that is all too real and tangible.

1951
01:40:29,054 --> 01:40:30,578
它带来痛苦
It gives pain.

1952
01:40:30,723 --> 01:40:33,521
这想法很短暂 我又回到了键盘前
It's brief, and soon
I am back again at the keyboard,

1953
01:40:33,659 --> 01:40:35,890
重新梳理过去40年的生活
reliving the past 40 years.

1954
01:40:36,029 --> 01:40:39,965
但我想 这想法会一直在潜意识中影响我
But I suppose it will always
be lurking to catch me unawares.

1955
01:40:40,100 --> 01:40:42,933
所以或许这个故事是一种否认的形式
So perhaps this story is a form of denial.

1956
01:40:43,937 --> 01:40:47,270
真实讽刺啊 这故事最终
How ironic it is that the final revelation

1957
01:40:47,407 --> 01:40:48,738
产生的结果
and its aftermath

1958
01:40:48,875 --> 01:40:51,970
是让萨拉和我重新变得亲密
have brought Sarah and I closer together

1959
01:40:53,514 --> 01:40:56,450
也让我开始大量写作
and resulted in me writing volumes,

1960
01:40:56,585 --> 01:40:59,245
正如戴安一直希望的一样
as Diane always wanted me to.

1961
01:40:59,386 --> 01:41:02,481
它赋予了我的人生新的意义
It has given me a new lease on life.

1962
01:41:09,097 --> 01:41:10,827
今天凌晨5点26分
At 5:26 this morning,

1963
01:41:10,967 --> 01:41:12,866
詹妮弗生下了一个女孩
a little girl was born to Jennifer,

1964
01:41:13,001 --> 01:41:14,629
我的儿媳
my son's wife.

1965
01:41:14,770 --> 01:41:16,761
已经差不多75年过去了
It's almost three quarters of a century

1966
01:41:16,905 --> 01:41:19,703
从我出生于伊尔福市的时候算起
since I was pulled out into the air of llford,

1967
01:41:19,841 --> 01:41:22,140
现在这个小女孩
and now this small girl

1968
01:41:22,278 --> 01:41:25,043
开始学着在多伦多如何生活
is starting to learn about life in Toronto.

1969
01:41:25,181 --> 01:41:26,614
有一件事是肯定的
One thing is certain:

1970
01:41:26,749 --> 01:41:29,810
她的生活会和我的完全不同
her life will be radically
different from mine.

1971
01:41:29,954 --> 01:41:32,386
不同到好像
So different that we might as well be born

1972
01:41:32,521 --> 01:41:34,786
我们是出生在相距很多光年的不同星球
on planets light-years apart.

1973
01:41:34,924 --> 01:41:39,055
我想 她会对自己爷爷的人生故事很感兴趣
I think she'll be interested
to read of her grandfather's life,

1974
01:41:39,196 --> 01:41:40,857
叙述的方式
set down in a way that makes it

1975
01:41:40,998 --> 01:41:43,524
让它和历史书有很大不同
very unlike the stuff of history books.

1976
01:41:44,202 --> 01:41:48,399
啊 我在写这些的时候 又有一只苍蝇飞来
Ah, and now there's a fly
buzzing around me as I write.

1977
01:41:49,073 --> 01:41:51,634
它嗡嗡飞了一会儿 寻找食物
It'll buzz around
for a short time looking for food,

1978
01:41:51,776 --> 01:41:54,438
找到食物以后 就会想找个伴
and, once sustained, may seek a mate.

1979
01:41:55,547 --> 01:41:57,140
它永远不会知道原因
It will never know why.

1980
01:41:58,284 --> 01:42:00,308
它的命运是注定的
It has simply been sentenced

1981
01:42:00,452 --> 01:42:04,081
和它那些成千上万的祖先们一样
to follow the demands
of millions of ancestors.

1982
01:42:04,222 --> 01:42:07,919
对那只苍蝇来说 “为什么”三个字是不存在的
For that fly,
the word "why" does not exist.

1983
01:42:08,694 --> 01:42:10,526
是啊 就是这样了 迈克尔
Yes, that's it, Michael,

1984
01:42:10,664 --> 01:42:12,654
接受命运吧
just accept the sentence.

1985
01:42:14,701 --> 01:42:16,032
我会继续下去
I will go on.

1986
01:42:17,971 --> 01:42:19,404
我会继续下去
I will go on.

1987
01:42:49,204 --> 01:42:53,503
我真的对这件事的不同说法很感兴趣
I'm just so curious
at all the versions of this story

1988
01:42:53,641 --> 01:42:56,874
从我13岁开始就很多人说
that have been in existence
since I was, like, 13,

1989
01:42:57,013 --> 01:42:59,674
第一次是我姐姐跟我开玩笑的
and my sister first
told me as a joke,

1990
01:42:59,815 --> 01:43:02,182
“你知道吗 你爸可能不是你亲爸”
"You know, your dad's probably
not your real dad. "

1991
01:43:02,318 --> 01:43:05,184
等我到了18岁 一直听到你的名字
And then when I was 18,
hearing your name all the time,

1992
01:43:05,854 --> 01:43:07,186
然后发现了哈利
and then finding Harry,

1993
01:43:07,323 --> 01:43:09,449
然后得到了DNA检测的证实
and then it being
proved by a DNA test.

1994
01:43:09,591 --> 01:43:10,582
是啊
Yeah.

1995
01:43:10,728 --> 01:43:12,695
所以现在我采访大家 会感觉很奇怪
So it's just weird that now
when I interview people,

1996
01:43:12,829 --> 01:43:15,765
比如她有两个很亲密的朋友
like, a couple of her close friends

1997
01:43:15,900 --> 01:43:17,390
对于哈利是我的生父这件事感到很震惊
were shocked that Harry was my dad,

1998
01:43:17,535 --> 01:43:19,627
因为他们一直以为你才是我的生父
because they always
thought you were my dad.

1999
01:43:22,663 --> 01:43:24,116
嗯...
Um...

2000
01:43:25,293 --> 01:43:28,472
那好吧 我必须...
Well, okay, then. I'll have to, uh...

2001
01:43:28,838 --> 01:43:31,679
我必须承认我们的确上过一次床
I'll have to tell you that
we did sleep together once.

2002
01:43:33,385 --> 01:43:39,385
