那小玩意是誰
Who's the pygmy?

4
00:00:10,281 --> 00:00:11,696
它怎么占了我的位
What's it doing in my seat?

5
00:00:11,697 --> 00:00:14,268
曾奶奶  這是你的重孫女喜旺呀

6
00:00:14,461 --> 00:00:15,834
你他媽又是誰啊

7
00:00:15,835 --> 00:00:17,803
好吧  我覺得曾奶奶又糊涂了
Yeah, I think Maw Maw's confused again.

8
00:00:17,985 --> 00:00:19,751
曾奶奶  你最后記得的事情是什么
Maw Maw, what's the last thing you remember?

00:00:19,752 --> 00:00:22,930
那個熊孩子出去買泡泡糖味的冰激凌
That dopey looking kid went out to get bubblegum ice cream.

10
00:00:22,931 --> 00:00:25,710
哇  她把過去三年的事都忘干凈了
Wow. She's forgotten, like, the last three years.

11
00:00:25,711 --> 00:00:27,400
樂器走起
Get out the instruments,

12
00:00:27,401 --> 00:00:28,933
她需要記憶重啟
she needs a memory reset.

13
00:00:28,934 --> 00:00:30,934
一  二  三

猴子

24
00:00:58,729 --> 00:01:01,387
或許一些特殊事件能觸發她的記憶
Maybe some specifics would jog her memory.

25
00:01:01,388 --> 00:01:02,620
曾奶奶  你可還記得

*Hope got stuck in Virginia's shed

你還是覺得稀里糊涂的嗎

00:02:03,856 --> 00:02:04,807
埃德加
Edgar.

54
00:02:06,553 --> 00:02:07,609
喜旺
Hope!

55
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,273
我希望你的名字也叫埃德加
I hope your name is Edgar, too--

56
00:02:09,274 --> 00:02:10,858
那就好笑死了

Burt!

00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:39,948
快跟我來  我又看到他了
You got to come with me. I saw him again.

59
00:02:39,949 --> 00:02:41,501
那個白人版的摩根·弗里曼[著名演員]嗎
That guy who looks like white Morgan Freeman?

60
00:02:41,502 --> 00:02:43,086
不  是"閃現男"
No. deja vu Man!

61
00:02:43,087 --> 00:02:44,318
該死  我老是遇不著他
Damn, I always miss him.

62
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,164
-他們在說誰呢  -閃現男
- What are they talking about? - deja vu Man.

63
00:02:46,351 --> 00:02:47,830
他是我老媽意淫出來的朋友
He's mom's imaginary friend.

64
00:02:47,831 --> 00:02:50,567
才不是  他是真實存在的
He's not imaginary. He's real.

65
00:02:50,855 --> 00:02:53,237
每隔幾年就會閃現一次
He shows up every few years.

66
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:54,307
還記得第一次見面
The first time,

67
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:56,770
我正在等曾爺爺來接我放學
I was waiting for Paw Paw to pick me up from school.

68
00:02:56,895 --> 00:02:58,507
還當他是個變態呢
I just thought he was a pervert,

69
00:02:58,508 --> 00:03:00,703
但后來發現他胡子剃得超干凈
but then when I saw he didn't have a mustache,

70
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:02,070
我琢磨著自己是不是
I assumed I was being discovered

71
00:03:02,071 --> 00:03:04,489
被便衣模特星探發現了
by an undercover modeling talent scout.

72
00:03:07,376 --> 00:03:09,957
門兒敲敲敲  清潔工來到

73
00:03:07,776 --> 00:03:11,788
他總是在我最不上照的時候出現
He always shows up when I'm at my least photogenic.

74
00:03:17,827 --> 00:03:20,627
最近一次是在大約一年前
The last time before today was about a year ago.

75
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:30,887
我們必須速度趕過去
We got to get there quick.

76
00:03:30,888 --> 00:03:32,097
我跟蹤他到了理發店
I followed him to the barbershop

77
00:03:32,098 --> 00:03:33,431
他的頭發可不多  分分鐘就剪完了
and he doesn't have a lot of hair.

78
00:03:35,809 --> 00:03:38,143
輪到誰轉了啊
Someone gonna spin, or what?

79
00:03:39,396 --> 00:03:40,450
他在那兒
There he is.

80
00:03:41,024 --> 00:03:42,109
讓我看看
Let me see.

81
00:03:44,007 --> 00:03:44,884
看見了嗎
You see him?

82
00:03:45,065 --> 00:03:47,566
沒  被洗剪吹合唱團擋住了
No. The Hair-monizers are in the way.

83
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,321
他們看上去唱得很歡樂
They look like they sound great.

84
00:03:50,537 --> 00:03:52,395
快看  餅干男也在
Hey! Cookie Man is in there, too!

85
00:03:52,396 --> 00:03:53,432
哪個
Which one?

86
00:03:53,906 --> 00:03:55,489
窗戶旁邊正刮胡子的那個
The guy by the window getting a shave.

87
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:58,794
但那個就是閃現男啊
But... the guy by the window getting a shave, that's deja vu Man!

88
00:04:00,012 --> 00:04:02,688
所以說閃現男就是餅干男
Then deja vu Man is also Cookie Man!

89
00:04:04,062 --> 00:04:04,947
好吧  我忍不住了
Okay, fine, I'll bite--

90
00:04:04,948 --> 00:04:07,311
-誰是餅干男  -我爹意淫出來的朋友
- who's Cookie Man? - Dad's imaginary friend.

91
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:09,299
餅干男好多年前就出現了
Cookie Man started coming around years ago

92
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,468
當時吉米還是個小孩
when Jimmy was little.

93
00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:12,087
他總是出現在公園
He would show up at the park

94
00:04:12,087 --> 00:04:13,087
分餅干給我們吃
and share his cookies with us.

95
00:04:13,088 --> 00:04:14,733
還老打聽吉米的事
He was always asking about Jimmy.

96
00:04:14,734 --> 00:04:16,328
這娃可聰明了
He's a very smart baby.

97
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,898
我覺得他是遺傳到我的優良基因
I think he gets from me.

98
00:04:18,523 --> 00:04:21,779
-你是在喝母乳嗎  -是啊  你想來點嗎
- Are you drinking breast milk? - Yeah. You want some?

99
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,462
不  我就免了吧
Uh, no, I'm gonna pass.

100
00:04:25,994 --> 00:04:27,293
那個面具可真有意思
Well, that's an interesting mask.

101
00:04:27,294 --> 00:04:29,142
他扮的是誰啊
Uh, what's he supposed to be?

102
00:04:29,555 --> 00:04:32,369
我們問過他萬圣節想裝扮成誰
We asked him what he wanted to dress up as for Halloween--

103
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:33,702
他說  吉米
he said, "Jimmy."

104
00:04:34,152 --> 00:04:35,483
他只會說這個詞
It's the only word he knows.

105
00:04:35,815 --> 00:04:37,596
-對吧  兒子  -吉米
- Isn't that right, boy? - Jimmy.

106
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:39,646
你想再來點餅干嗎
Want some more cookies?

107
00:04:39,647 --> 00:04:40,509
吉米
Jimmy.

108
00:04:40,782 --> 00:04:41,676
你幾歲了
How old are you?

109
00:04:41,677 --> 00:04:42,522
吉米
Jimmy.

110
00:04:42,825 --> 00:04:43,689
你叫什么名字
What's your name?

111
00:04:43,801 --> 00:04:44,596
餅干
Cookie!

112
00:04:45,017 --> 00:04:47,481
太好了  他學了個新詞
Hey! He learned a new word!

113
00:04:47,961 --> 00:04:49,121
我就跟你說他很聰明吧
Told you he was smart.

114
00:04:53,815 --> 00:04:54,786
他上個月還剛出現過
He even showed up last month

115
00:04:54,787 --> 00:04:56,258
當時我正帶喜旺在公園玩
when I was in the park with Hope.

116
00:04:56,259 --> 00:04:58,376
其實有很多陌生人
You know, there's a lot of strangers

117
00:04:58,377 --> 00:05:00,278
在鎮上散發零食給孩子們吃
who hand treats to kids in this town,

118
00:05:00,895 --> 00:05:02,687
但目前為止  你的餅干是最美味的
but your cookies are by far the best.

119
00:05:02,688 --> 00:05:04,947
伯特  我可不是陌生人
Burt, please, I'm not a stranger.

120
00:05:05,062 --> 00:05:06,216
我是餅干男
I'm Cookie Man.

121
00:05:07,782 --> 00:05:09,156
我真的很抱歉  伯特
I'm really sorry, Burt.

122
00:05:09,157 --> 00:05:10,907
我還以為餅干男是你瞎編出來的呢
I always thought you made up Cookie Man

123
00:05:10,908 --> 00:05:12,916
幫著吉米不好好吃晚飯找借口
just to cover for spoiling Jimmy's dinner.

124
00:05:12,917 --> 00:05:16,109
我也很抱歉  我也常懷疑閃現男
I'm sorry, too. I sometimes wondered if deja vu Man

125
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,607
是你那瘋狂陰謀論的又一產物
was just another one of your crazy conspiracy theories,

126
00:05:18,608 --> 00:05:20,295
就像飛碟啦  大腳怪啦
like UFOs or Bigfoot

127
00:05:20,296 --> 00:05:21,901
或什么特拉華州根本不存在
or that Delaware doesn't actually exist.

128
00:05:21,902 --> 00:05:24,214
有本事說出一個去過特拉華州的人試試看
Name one person that's ever been to Delaware.

129
00:05:24,215 --> 00:05:26,624
那個在刮胡子的男人
Did you say that deja vu-slash-Cookie Man

130
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,431
就是你們說的閃現餅干男
was the one in front getting a shave?

131
00:05:28,432 --> 00:05:31,427
-是啊  怎么了  -好奇先生也是他
- Yeah. Why? - 'Cause that's also Super Curious Guy!

132
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:32,824
好奇先生是誰啊
Who's Super Curious Guy?

133
00:05:32,825 --> 00:05:35,809
那是吉米意淫出來的朋友
That would be Jimmy's imaginary friend.

134
00:05:36,018 --> 00:05:37,472
他是真實存在的
He is not imaginary.

135
00:05:37,473 --> 00:05:40,460
這人總是時不時會在碼頭出現
He's this guy who shows up every now and then on the loading dock

136
00:05:40,461 --> 00:05:42,612
跟我問七問八
and asks me tons of questions.

137
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,893
我記得有一次他說
I remember once that he said...

138
00:05:44,894 --> 00:05:45,809
吉米  沒空聽你扯
Jimmy! There's no time!

139
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,709
知道你有好些趣事可以說
I'm sure you got two or three funny memories you could describe,

140
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:50,313
但我們現在得先想出下一步對策
but we need to figure out what to do next.

141
00:05:50,314 --> 00:05:52,079
是白人版摩根·弗里曼
Ooh! White Morgan Freeman!

142
00:05:59,803 --> 00:06:00,916
哦天哪
Oh, my God.

143
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:05,099
閃現男  餅干男  好奇先生居然
Deja Vu Man, Cookie Man, and Super Curious Guy is also

144
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,248
還是個外科醫生  96年我見他偷了我媽的腎
Roofie Surgeon, who I saw steal my mother's kidney in 1996.

145
00:06:08,249 --> 00:06:09,271
此話當真
Really?

146
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,923
姐扯的  姐那時太寂寞  
No, I just felt left out.

147
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:12,073
伯特  我們怎么打算
Okay, Burt, how should we play this?

148
00:06:12,074 --> 00:06:13,900
你們干啥不直接過去
You guys, why don't you just go over there

149
00:06:13,901 --> 00:06:15,302
問他到底打的什么主意
and ask him what's going on?

150
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:18,243
你提得出這種建議
You make suggestions like that,

151
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:19,449
還不知道自己當年為啥寂寞
you wonder why you get left out?

152
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:20,551
多謝提議  塞布麗娜
Thanks, Sabrina.

153
00:06:20,552 --> 00:06:22,662
我們都知道  他是公務員
For all we know, he works for the government

154
00:06:22,663 --> 00:06:26,129
人一個不高興就能把咱扔杰羅尼莫灣關上一輩子
and can lock us all up in Geronimo Bay for the rest of our lives.

155
00:06:22,663 --> 00:06:26,129
羅杰尼莫灣  二次元高級軍事基地

156
00:06:26,508 --> 00:06:28,521
他要走了  咱得跟上
Oh, he's leaving, we've got to follow him,

157
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:29,579
看看他背后的主子到底是誰
find out who he works for.

158
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,222
高  實在是高
Good idea. Good idea.

159
00:06:31,223 --> 00:06:32,741
吉米  記得我們討論過
Jimmy, do you remember

160
00:06:32,742 --> 00:06:34,145
當你爹媽發神經時
how we talked about not letting your parents

161
00:06:34,146 --> 00:06:36,298
我們不能總被卷進去嗎
drag us into something crazy every week?

162
00:06:36,344 --> 00:06:37,792
我得去接喜旺了
Guys, I got to go pick up Hope.

163
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:41,406
我這不是在努力做一個負責的爹嘛
I am trying to be a responsible parent.

164
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,558
糟了  他要蹬上自行車了
Oh, crap, he's getting on his bike.

165
00:06:44,559 --> 00:06:46,591
我們是把卡車開來  還是徒步跟蹤
Should we get the truck, or follow him on foot?

166
00:06:49,077 --> 00:06:50,024
都不用
Neither.

167
00:06:55,794 --> 00:06:56,721
我跟著呢
I got him.

168
00:07:05,365 --> 00:07:08,457
我不知道這人的真實身份  但他絕對是個土豪
I don't know who this guy is, but he must be loaded.

169
00:07:05,571 --> 00:07:11,342
三季汽車旅館

170
00:07:08,457 --> 00:07:10,688
他住的可是三季汽車旅館
He's staying at the Three Seasons Motel.

171
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,809
他到底在搞什么
What is he doing in there?

172
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,557
自己出謎自己猜
He's either doing solo charades

173
00:07:17,626 --> 00:07:19,165
或者打太極
or Tai Chi.

174
00:07:19,783 --> 00:07:21,717
如果謎面就是太極的話  那他就是邊猜邊打
Or both, if the clue is "Tai Chi."

175
00:07:21,718 --> 00:07:23,821
咱必須得承認  這人還有點意思
I got to be honest, he sounds like an interesting guy.

176
00:07:23,822 --> 00:07:25,577
我覺得他肯定是公務員
I'll bet he works for the government.

177
00:07:25,691 --> 00:07:26,694
我不明白
I just don't understand

178
00:07:26,695 --> 00:07:28,400
他干啥對我們的生活那么感興趣
why they care so much about what we're doing.

179
00:07:28,401 --> 00:07:30,838
反正哥無聊的時候
Well, when I'm bored, I like to look up

180
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:32,257
就愛上網看看怎么造炸彈
how to build bombs on the Internet.

181
00:07:32,258 --> 00:07:34,514
九十年代  姐無聊時還愛去放點小火呢
And I was a bit of a firebug in the '90s.

182
00:07:34,515 --> 00:07:36,579
也許他跟蹤我們也是有苦衷的
Maybe he's following us for a good reason.

183
00:07:37,132 --> 00:07:39,388
說不定他是黑客帝國里的人
Maybe he's one of those guys from The Matrix.

184
00:07:39,694 --> 00:07:41,568
那樣他就能跟我說說黑客帝國到底是咋回事了
Then he could explain The Matrix to me.

185
00:07:42,422 --> 00:07:43,386
他要走了
Oh, he's leaving.

186
00:07:44,082 --> 00:07:45,312
機會來了
All right, here's our chance--

187
00:07:45,313 --> 00:07:47,092
我們溜進他房間  去查明此人真實身份
we're gonna break into his room and find out who he is.

188
00:07:47,093 --> 00:07:48,266
聽著挺像回事兒
Sounds like a plan.

189
00:07:48,475 --> 00:07:50,031
哥只要一個打火機
All I'm gonna need is a lighter,

190
00:07:50,055 --> 00:07:51,446
一瓶潔廁劑
a bottle of toilet bowl cleaner,

191
00:07:51,447 --> 00:07:52,677
還有一老式鬧鐘
and an old-fashioned alarm clock.

192
00:07:52,678 --> 00:07:54,695
就能在他門上炸個洞出來
We'll blow a hole right through his door.

193
00:07:54,843 --> 00:07:58,024
或者我們可以直接用"請勿打擾"牌直接撬開門
Or we could just jimmy it open with the "Do Not Disturb" Sign.

194
00:08:03,912 --> 00:08:06,365
真豪華
Whoa! Fancy.

195
00:08:06,366 --> 00:08:08,860
搖滾明星就得在這種房間里嗑藥啊
This is the type of room a rock star would O.D. In.

196
00:08:09,224 --> 00:08:10,508
來試試這個
Hey, check this out.

197
00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:11,493
咋了
What? What is it?

198
00:08:12,861 --> 00:08:14,186
全宇宙最銷魂的床
The greatest bed ever made.

199
00:08:14,187 --> 00:08:14,982
你必須來試試
You got to try this.

200
00:08:14,983 --> 00:08:17,227
伯特  別這樣  我們得
Burt, we can't. We got to...

201
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,170
我的神哪
Oh, my God.

202
00:08:22,915 --> 00:08:25,164
這床硬度恰好  柔軟適度
It's both firm and soft.

203
00:08:25,165 --> 00:08:27,594
姐好像都看到天堂了
It's like lying on Santa Claus.

204
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:31,830
搞什么飛機
What the hell?

205
00:08:34,137 --> 00:08:35,519
姐的整個人生啊
It's, like, my whole life.

206
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,881
這太詭異了
This is creepy.

207
00:08:37,218 --> 00:08:38,386
在他回來
Let's get out of here quick,

208
00:08:38,387 --> 00:08:40,988
把我們的臉剝了做面具前  我們快溜
before he comes back and makes masks out of our faces.

209
00:08:42,784 --> 00:08:44,329
現在我也有他的照片了
Now I got a picture of him.

210
00:08:45,805 --> 00:08:48,167
哇  這張把我倆都照得不錯嘛
Wow. We both looked really good in that shot.

211
00:08:48,168 --> 00:08:48,929
那倒是
You're right.

212
00:08:49,156 --> 00:08:51,480
如果他不是變態殺人狂的話
If he doesn't turn to be a weirdo pervert killer,

213
00:08:51,481 --> 00:08:53,310
我們就找他幫拍圣誕卡片照
we should have him take our Christmas card.

214
00:08:56,693 --> 00:08:59,348
做傳單找出此人真實身份的主意實在太妙
Making a flyer to find out who this guy is was a great idea.

215
00:08:59,349 --> 00:09:03,012
傳單  你那傻兒子又走丟了嗎
Flyers? Did that dopey son of yours wander off again?

216
00:09:03,013 --> 00:09:03,803
才不是
No.

217
00:09:03,804 --> 00:09:05,263
那是誰走丟了
Well, who's lost, then?

218
00:09:05,307 --> 00:09:06,801
你家瘋奶奶
Your crazy old grandmother?

219
00:09:06,802 --> 00:09:08,207
那不就是你嘛  曾奶奶
That's you, Maw Maw.

220
00:09:09,565 --> 00:09:12,488
阿諾德  快把這張照片扔出去
Arnold! Get this picture out of my house.

221
00:09:12,489 --> 00:09:13,245
你認識這人
You know who this is?

222
00:09:13,246 --> 00:09:16,564
認識  這混小子睡了我女兒
Yeah. That's the bastard who knocked my daughter up.

223
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:21,081
睡了你女兒的混蛋  那不就是
So the guy who knocked up your daughter... would be...

224
00:09:21,082 --> 00:09:22,938
-我爹  -等等我想想
- My father?!  - No. Wait.

225
00:09:27,686 --> 00:09:29,072
就是你爹
Your father!

226
00:09:29,479 --> 00:09:31,592
如果你認識此人
請撥555-0137

227
00:09:34,767 --> 00:09:37,983
我第一眼看到這個惡心男人的時候
I knew this no-good, disgusting excuse for a man was trouble

228
00:09:37,984 --> 00:09:39,537
就知道肯定沒好事
the minute I laid eyes on him.

229
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:41,091
但他是我爹啊
But he's my father.

230
00:09:41,092 --> 00:09:42,739
爺爺就是你爹
Paw Paw was your father.

231
00:09:42,801 --> 00:09:45,112
阿諾德只是個道德淪喪的混蛋
Arnold's just an immoral, horrible person.

232
00:09:45,113 --> 00:09:46,993
你不會想和那種人扯上關系的
You don't want to associate with people like that.

233
00:09:46,994 --> 00:09:49,195
所以你就編了個維吉尼亞她爹
So you just made up a story about Virginia's father dying

234
00:09:49,196 --> 00:09:50,468
死在馬賽中的故事
in a horse racing accident?

235
00:09:50,469 --> 00:09:51,832
你為什么要這么做啊
Why would you do that?

236
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:54,262
因為那時你想要一匹小馬和一個爸爸
Because you wanted a pony and a father,

237
00:09:54,263 --> 00:09:56,447
這不是一石二鳥嘛
and it solved two problems at once.

238
00:09:58,641 --> 00:10:01,391
我們還是去找你爹吧
Well... guess we'd better go meet your dad.

239
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:04,289
不去  如果他想走進我生活的話
No way. If he wanted to be a part of my life,

240
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:06,113
他多得是機會來找我
he had plenty of chances to talk to me.

241
00:10:06,114 --> 00:10:08,445
我覺得你需要點菲爾醫生總愛說的
But I think you're gonna need some of that...

242
00:10:06,114 --> 00:10:09,445
著名心理醫生與主持人

243
00:10:09,098 --> 00:10:11,763
那什么感情什么東西
emotional stuff Dr. Phil's always talking about.

244
00:10:11,785 --> 00:10:16,027
就是  你不能用紅柄梳子修輪胎
The... "You can't fix a flat tire with a red-handled hairbrush."

245
00:10:16,105 --> 00:10:17,086
不是這句
Nah, that's not it.

246
00:10:17,087 --> 00:10:18,575
爹  媽
Ma! Dad!

247
00:10:18,687 --> 00:10:20,875
快看看我剛為父女舞會
Check out the moves I just taught Hope

248
00:10:20,876 --> 00:10:22,543
教給喜旺的舞步
for the father-daughter dance!

249
00:10:24,634 --> 00:10:26,231
得了吧  吉米
Oh, come on, Jimmy.

250
00:10:26,242 --> 00:10:28,907
這樣下去她什么時候才能學會自己跳舞
How is she supposed to ever learn to dance on her own?

251
00:10:28,908 --> 00:10:31,391
壓抑小孩才能  這是哪門子的爹啊
What the hell kind of father smothers his daughter like that?

252
00:10:31,392 --> 00:10:33,196
維吉尼亞  你心情不好
Virginia, you're obviously upset.

253
00:10:33,781 --> 00:10:36,829
哥一般不喝啤酒  但一喝起來
"I don't always drink beer, but when I do..."

254
00:10:37,082 --> 00:10:39,324
不  這也不是菲爾醫生說的
Nah, that's not Dr. Phil.

255
00:10:39,325 --> 00:10:42,272
拜托  順手關門好嗎  蟲子都飛進來了
And for God's sake, you're letting all the bugs in. Close the door.

256
00:10:42,273 --> 00:10:44,052
了斷[關閉]  就是這個了
Closure-- that's it!

257
00:10:44,115 --> 00:10:45,904
你得去見見你爹  做個了斷
You got to go meet your dad for closure.

258
00:10:46,542 --> 00:10:48,093
好吧  我去
Fine, I'll go.

259
00:10:48,472 --> 00:10:50,632
但那可不是因為我信菲爾醫生
But it's not because I trust Dr. Phil.

260
00:10:50,987 --> 00:10:52,143
只是在《實習醫生格蕾》里
It's 'cause that closure thing

261
00:10:52,144 --> 00:10:54,100
這套理論似乎還挺管用
always seems to work on Grey's Anatomy.

262
00:10:57,392 --> 00:10:59,478
我手都開始抖了
Oh, my hand's shaking.

263
00:10:59,479 --> 00:11:01,914
自從吉米出生后  我好久都沒這么緊張過了
I haven't been this nervous since Jimmy was born.

264
00:11:02,239 --> 00:11:04,042
至少生吉米時我還能抽煙緩和一下
At least I had cigarettes to get me through that.

265
00:11:04,043 --> 00:11:05,306
放松放松
Don't be nervous.

266
00:11:05,307 --> 00:11:07,164
想象一下你爹只穿內褲的樣子
Just picture your dad in his underwear.

267
00:11:07,165 --> 00:11:08,724
伯特  關鍵是我不認識他
Burt, I've never met the man.

268
00:11:08,725 --> 00:11:10,665
不知道他穿啥樣的內褲啊
I don't know what sort of underwear he wears.

269
00:11:13,052 --> 00:11:14,511
不好意思
No, I'm sorry, no, uh...

270
00:11:14,687 --> 00:11:16,968
我今天不需要家政服務  也不用修理草坪
no housekeeping or lawn care today.

271
00:11:16,969 --> 00:11:19,270
一看就知道你們是干這行的
Assuming that's what you do.

272
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,541
少廢話  別以為我不知道你是誰
Cut the crap. I know who you are

273
00:11:21,542 --> 00:11:24,510
我還知道你這么多年來干的那些鬼事
and I know what you've been doing all these years,

274
00:11:24,511 --> 00:11:25,793
趕緊給我收手
and it needs to stop.

275
00:11:25,794 --> 00:11:27,468
-離我家人遠點  -好
- Stay away from my family... - Okay.

276
00:11:27,469 --> 00:11:29,773
把偷拍我們的照片刪干凈
...and delete all those creepy pictures of us.

277
00:11:29,774 --> 00:11:31,635
然后有多遠滾多遠
And then I want you to go away

278
00:11:31,636 --> 00:11:33,268
別再陰魂不散了
and never come near us again.

279
00:11:34,087 --> 00:11:35,232
不過你先告訴我
Right after you tell me

280
00:11:35,233 --> 00:11:37,345
為什么一個人能夠
what possible reason a person could have

281
00:11:37,346 --> 00:11:39,380
如此狠心拋棄自己年幼的寶貝女兒
to abandon his precious baby girl.

282
00:11:41,365 --> 00:11:42,258
因為我是基佬
I'm gay.

283
00:11:44,773 --> 00:11:46,286
我暈
I'm confused.

284
00:11:46,287 --> 00:11:47,626
我當年就是同性戀了
So was I, back then.

285
00:11:48,191 --> 00:11:49,645
一切都發生在后臺
You see, it all started backstage

286
00:11:49,646 --> 00:11:51,478
那晚在餐廳劇院有一場《皮蓬》
after a dinner theater performance of Pippin.

287
00:11:51,479 --> 00:11:52,628
我演皮蓬
I played Pippin,

288
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:55,560
當地的評論家都盛贊我的表演可謂精彩絕倫
local critic said I was "mesmerizing."

289
00:11:55,561 --> 00:11:56,604
慶功宴后
After the cast party,

290
00:11:56,605 --> 00:11:59,658
一瓶蘋果酒把我和你媽都給放倒了
your mom, me, and a bottle of apple wine--

291
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:03,084
于是我們暈頭轉向地進了道具室
we, made our way into the prop closet.

292
00:12:03,085 --> 00:12:04,031
維吉妮亞  這也許可以解釋
Virginia, that's probably where you get

293
00:12:04,032 --> 00:12:05,669
為什么你這么喜歡喝果酒
your love of fruit-based alcohol.

294
00:12:06,516 --> 00:12:09,375
假裝非常享受與那姑娘滾床單
Pretending to enjoy sex with a woman

295
00:12:09,376 --> 00:12:12,946
是我那晚的第二場精彩演出
was perhaps my second great performance that evening.

296
00:12:12,947 --> 00:12:14,349
一不小心就當上爹了
Your mom got pregnant,

297
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,373
而我
and I got...

298
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,751
我大大方方地出了柜
I got the guts to admit that I am gay.

299
00:12:18,908 --> 00:12:20,076
我也不想走
I wanted to stay,

300
00:12:20,086 --> 00:12:23,311
但1973年的納什維爾
but no, the-the people of Natesville in 1973,

301
00:12:23,312 --> 00:12:27,877
沒有我的容身之地
they did not want to be associated with, "my kind."

302
00:12:27,878 --> 00:12:30,081
這就是曾奶奶生氣的原因
That's what Maw Maw was talking about.

303
00:12:30,587 --> 00:12:31,573
她恨死你了
She hates you.

304
00:12:31,574 --> 00:12:34,020
是啊  曾爺爺也不怎么高興
Yeah, Paw Paw wasn't so thrilled either.

305
00:12:34,021 --> 00:12:35,492
你有沒有嘗過穿著羊絨喇叭褲
You ever tried dodging buckshot

306
00:12:35,493 --> 00:12:36,872
躲避大鉛彈的滋味
in cashmere bell-bottoms?

307
00:12:36,873 --> 00:12:38,075
想想都痛苦
I can only imagine.

308
00:12:38,347 --> 00:12:40,551
我曾穿著牛仔短褲嘗試過  已經很不易了
I did it in jean shorts and that wasn't easy.

309
00:12:40,981 --> 00:12:42,692
真的很抱歉
I am so sorry.

310
00:12:42,693 --> 00:12:43,877
這不是你的錯
It wasn't your fault.

311
00:12:44,851 --> 00:12:45,791
是我不好
Was my fault.

312
00:12:46,343 --> 00:12:47,350
我不希望你在成長的過程中
I didn't want you to grow up

313
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:49,409
總是被人嘲笑有一個基佬爸爸
with the stigma of having a gay father.

314
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,966
我只能請求你的原諒
I can only hope you'll forgive me.

315
00:12:52,262 --> 00:12:53,296
爹地
Daddy!

316
00:12:53,297 --> 00:12:55,775
當老媽弄清楚  她爸當年為何要離開后
Once my mom understood why her dad had left,

317
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:57,568
她就沒法再對他生氣了
it was hard to stay mad at him.

318
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:58,567
冰淇淋

319
00:12:57,881 --> 00:12:59,756
他們也都想追回
And they both wanted to make up for lost time

320
00:12:59,757 --> 00:13:02,760
曾經錯過的父女時光
doing all those father-daughter things they missed out on.

321
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,519
你的奶子就和布里的車輪一樣大[法語]
Vos mamelons sont comme des roues de Brie.

322
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:09,984
他說...
He said...

323
00:13:13,609 --> 00:13:14,489
他說了啥
What'd he say?

324
00:13:35,138 --> 00:13:37,048
我還指望今晚能吃上墨西哥肉卷呢
I was really looking forward to taco night.

325
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:38,075
別這樣  伯特
Oh, come on, Burt.

326
00:13:38,076 --> 00:13:39,540
你的味蕾也太單調了
Your palate is so pedestrian.

327
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:41,021
何不嘗試點新鮮事物呢
Why don't you try something new?

328
00:13:41,022 --> 00:13:43,729
壽司不就是遠東的墨西哥卷
Sushi is the taco of the Far East.

329
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:44,539
你看啊
Now, look.

330
00:13:46,872 --> 00:13:48,156
這里面富含蛋白質
You've got your protein,

331
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,384
和碳水化合物
you've got your rice,

332
00:13:49,385 --> 00:13:52,050
都用不著玉米餅
and instead of a corn tortilla,

333
00:13:52,107 --> 00:13:53,431
光一片海苔
it's all wrapped

334
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:55,591
便將美味與營養盡裹
in a delicious piece of mori.

335
00:13:55,592 --> 00:13:59,160
如果忽略它的制作食材的話  那就好吃多了
If you ignore-i what it's made of, it tastes p pretty good.

336
00:14:01,938 --> 00:14:03,392
海膽怎么樣  伯特
How is that sea urchin, Burt?

337
00:14:05,323 --> 00:14:07,819
就好像大海在我嘴里打了個噴嚏
It's like the ocean sneezed in my mouth.

338
00:14:08,933 --> 00:14:12,326
這么多年來  我背著相機跟蹤你們時
You know, all those years I've been following you guys around with a camera,

339
00:14:12,326 --> 00:14:14,019
多么渴望自己能走上來
and I feel like I've just walked

340
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,431
成為那畫面中的一份子
right into the picture.

341
00:14:16,178 --> 00:14:17,921
我們應該拍張全家福
You know, we should have a family photo.

342
00:14:17,922 --> 00:14:20,115
-我最愛拍全家福了  -必須有主題
- I love family photos. - With a theme.

343
00:14:20,116 --> 00:14:22,728
帶主題的全家福什么的最喜歡了
I love family photos with themes!

344
00:14:25,013 --> 00:14:28,603
納什維爾古董博物館

345
00:14:26,354 --> 00:14:27,425
太棒了
This is amazing.

346
00:14:27,426 --> 00:14:28,621
我最愛角色扮演了
I love costumes.

347
00:14:28,622 --> 00:14:30,048
親愛的  我是否有幸
Oh, boy, do I have a parade

348
00:14:30,049 --> 00:14:31,635
將你永遠留在這一刻
to take you to next summer.

349
00:14:31,636 --> 00:14:34,186
這肯定會是有史以來最漂亮的全家福
This is gonna be the best family photo ever.

350
00:14:34,187 --> 00:14:36,240
維吉妮亞  我得和你談談
Virginia, I gotta talk to you.

351
00:14:38,156 --> 00:14:39,896
超適合我的是不是
Isn't this the cat's pajamas?

352
00:14:39,897 --> 00:14:40,690
是啊
Yes.

353
00:14:40,691 --> 00:14:42,997
你就把自己的快樂建立在別人的丑態上
But only because I think cat's pajamas are stupid.

354
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:43,931
你爸爸給我挑的這身
I look like an idiot

355
00:14:43,932 --> 00:14:45,692
穿起來就像個白癡
in this thing your dad picked out.

356
00:14:45,693 --> 00:14:46,925
別這樣  伯特
Oh, come on, Burt.

357
00:14:46,926 --> 00:14:48,039
多好玩啊
This is fun.

358
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,051
不  不好玩
No, it's not fun.

359
00:14:49,052 --> 00:14:51,217
阿諾德一來就沒什么好事
Nothing's been fun since Arnold showed up.

360
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:52,579
你是在吃醋嗎
Are you jealous

361
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,364
就因為我總是和爸爸在一起
because I'm spending time with my dad?

362
00:14:54,365 --> 00:14:55,930
不是  但我知道
No. But I just know that

363
00:14:55,931 --> 00:14:57,059
他看不慣我的行為作風
he doesn't like the way I act

364
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,081
話不投機  飯也吃不到一塊兒
or what I say or what I like to eat.

365
00:14:59,167 --> 00:15:00,443
他對我簡直百般挑剔
He doesn't like anything about me.

366
00:15:00,444 --> 00:15:02,040
那你希望我怎么做
So what do you want me to do?

367
00:15:02,245 --> 00:15:03,220
他是我爸爸啊
He's my father.

368
00:15:03,221 --> 00:15:05,007
我以后都不能見他了嗎
Am I supposed to not see him anymore?

369
00:15:05,008 --> 00:15:06,291
我不是這個意思
I didn't say that.

370
00:15:06,632 --> 00:15:09,626
我只是希望他能離開  再也不要出現
I just would like him to go away and never come back.

371
00:15:10,032 --> 00:15:11,720
他讓我覺得很不舒服  維吉妮亞
He makes me uncomfortable, Virginia.

372
00:15:11,986 --> 00:15:13,532
他跟我們不是一類人
He's just too different than us.

373
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,891
聽到這里的人
Wish I could say I was surprised

374
00:15:15,892 --> 00:15:17,440
說出這樣的話
to hear that kind of intolerance

375
00:15:17,441 --> 00:15:18,871
還真是意料之中
from someone in this town.

376
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,147
他就在我身后  是不是
He's right behind me, isn't he?

377
00:15:22,148 --> 00:15:24,373
伯特  這話要在人家還沒開口之前就問
Burt, that only works if he hasn't said anything.

378
00:15:28,336 --> 00:15:30,548
很抱歉我跟你不是一類人  伯特
Sorry to be so different from you, Burt.

379
00:15:30,668 --> 00:15:33,773
顯然你老公不贊同我的生活方式
Obviously your husband doesn't approve of my lifestyle.

380
00:15:33,774 --> 00:15:35,889
不  不  那不是我的真實想法
No, no. Honestly, I didn't mean that.

381
00:15:36,244 --> 00:15:38,031
只是你喜歡的一切
It's just that everything you like to do

382
00:15:38,032 --> 00:15:39,955
讓我覺得難受不適
makes me uncomfortable or sick.

383
00:15:40,896 --> 00:15:43,271
看來想要融入你的生活是大錯特錯了
Trying to be a part of your life was clearly a mistake.

384
00:15:43,272 --> 00:15:45,690
我不適合演情景喜劇
I'm not one for melodrama, so...

385
00:15:46,251 --> 00:15:47,398
永別了
good-bye forever.

386
00:15:48,845 --> 00:15:49,719
伯特
Burt...

387
00:15:50,022 --> 00:15:51,773
我們剛剛父女重聚
I just got my dad back,

388
00:15:51,774 --> 00:15:53,437
你就把他趕走了
and now you drove him away.

389
00:15:53,729 --> 00:15:54,574
我能處理好的
I can fix this.

390
00:15:54,575 --> 00:15:55,951
還記得那次我打碎了你最愛的茶杯嗎
Like when I broke your favorite mug.

391
00:15:55,952 --> 00:15:58,022
就是那個每次喝水  我都會頭暈目眩的茶杯嗎
The mug that makes me dizzy every time I drink from it?

392
00:15:58,023 --> 00:15:58,940
沒錯
Good point.

393
00:15:59,071 --> 00:16:01,614
我保證  這次絕不用劣質有毒膠水
I promise I will not use the same toxic glue

394
00:16:01,615 --> 00:16:02,721
來修復我和你爸爸的關系
to fix your dad.

395
00:16:05,805 --> 00:16:08,429
老爸因為阿諾德外公的事很內疚
Dad felt so bad about what happened with Grandpa Arnold

396
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:10,334
所以他不僅在全家福中出鏡凹造型
that he not only posed for the family picture,

397
00:16:10,335 --> 00:16:11,555
還決定為此舉辦一個聚會
he decided to throw a party

398
00:16:11,556 --> 00:16:13,879
讓納什維爾的其他人都來歡迎阿諾德回家
so the rest of Natesville could welcome Arnold home.

399
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,636
他是個快樂的基佬
For he's a jolly gay fellow

400
00:16:15,637 --> 00:16:19,185
他是個開心的基佬
For he's a jolly gay fellow...

401
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,577
我原諒你們  納什維爾人民
I forgive you, Natesville.

402
00:16:20,578 --> 00:16:22,872
這點毋庸置疑
Which nobody can deny.

403
00:16:22,873 --> 00:16:27,418
后來我舍棄了終身職位
And then I left a... a tenured position

404
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:30,116
轉而去做一名自由人種音樂學家
to become a freelance ethnomusicologist.

405
00:16:30,117 --> 00:16:33,174
我曾在非洲的村落里見過一個男人
I once saw a man in a small African village

406
00:16:33,175 --> 00:16:35,216
單憑一個石頭和人的牙齒
who could perform an entire symphony

407
00:16:35,217 --> 00:16:37,722
就演奏出一首完整的交響曲
using nothing but a rock and a human tooth.

408
00:16:37,723 --> 00:16:39,482
天吶  真是美妙極了
Ah... Oh! Was it amazing?

409
00:16:39,483 --> 00:16:41,920
不是  聽得我想死
Oh, no, it was... it was excruciating.

410
00:16:43,431 --> 00:16:45,542
但他的努力確實值得敬佩  是吧
But you had to admire the effort, right?

411
00:16:45,543 --> 00:16:47,883
他周游列國  連加拿大都去過
He's been all over the world. Even Canada.

412
00:16:47,884 --> 00:16:49,476
學一下加拿大口音  老爸
Do your Canadian accent, Dad.

413
00:16:49,477 --> 00:16:51,074
維吉妮亞是我閨女
Virginia's my daughter, eh?

414
00:16:52,897 --> 00:16:54,380
跟在看現場版冰球賽似的[加拿大人擅打冰球]
It's like we're at a hockey game.

415
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:56,775
這是在給我過生日  還是守靈呢
This my birthday or my wake?

416
00:16:57,127 --> 00:16:57,871
把她弄進去
Go get her back inside.

417
00:16:57,872 --> 00:17:00,453
我不想讓她看到我爸  然后不停地攻擊同性戀
I don't want her to see my father and start gay-bashing.

418
00:17:00,454 --> 00:17:01,174
好
Okay.

419
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:03,802
給你守靈呢  你來早了
It's your wake and you're early.

420
00:17:03,803 --> 00:17:05,181
咱們進屋吧
Let's get you back inside.

421
00:17:05,701 --> 00:17:08,194
那個不要臉的混蛋怎么在這
What the hell is that depraved son of a bitch doing here?

422
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:09,544
他是我爸爸
He's my father,

423
00:17:09,627 --> 00:17:11,309
是我邀請他來的
and I invited him here.

424
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,802
這還是我家
This is still my house,

425
00:17:12,803 --> 00:17:14,780
我不想這種惡心
and I don't want that kind of disgusting,

426
00:17:14,781 --> 00:17:16,600
下流  變態
immoral, deviant...

427
00:17:18,161 --> 00:17:21,288
曾奶奶  你不能再說這種話了
Maw Maw, you can't say stuff like that anymore.

428
00:17:21,289 --> 00:17:23,990
好嗎  都2013年了
Okay? It's 2013.

429
00:17:23,991 --> 00:17:26,717
我靠  老娘也活得忒久了
Damn it, this life is taking forever.

430
00:17:26,943 --> 00:17:27,784
聽著
Look...

431
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:30,551
我們都接受了真正的他
we all accept my dad for who he is.

432
00:17:30,552 --> 00:17:33,942
納什維爾的人已經不介意他是同性戀了
Nobody in Natesville cares anymore that he's gay.

433
00:17:34,431 --> 00:17:35,473
他是同性戀
He's gay?

434
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,669
我對同性戀沒意見
Well, I don't have a problem with gays.

435
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,151
吉米就是同性戀  但我依然愛他
I mean, Jimmy's gay, and I love him

436
00:17:39,152 --> 00:17:40,350
還有他的小老公
and his little husband.

437
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,799
這是她對我說過的最動聽的話了
Oh, that's the nicest thing she's ever said to me.

438
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,852
但那家伙
But that guy?

439
00:17:44,145 --> 00:17:46,023
他是世界第一自戀狂
He's a first-class narcissist.

440
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:47,537
自戀狂
Oh, "Narcissist."

441
00:17:47,538 --> 00:17:49,425
咱們應該都知道這詞的意思吧
I think we know what that's code for.

442
00:17:49,426 --> 00:17:51,282
你哪個詞沒聽懂
You fall asleep in the middle of sentences?

443
00:17:51,283 --> 00:17:52,235
他是個自私的混蛋
He's a selfish jerk.

444
00:17:52,236 --> 00:17:54,305
他只關心自己
He doesn't care about anybody but himself.

445
00:17:54,387 --> 00:17:55,954
這就是他離開你和你媽的原因
That's why he left you and your mother.

446
00:17:55,955 --> 00:17:57,454
他沒離開
He didn't leave.

447
00:17:57,455 --> 00:17:59,567
他只是出城了  對吧
He was run out of town. Right?

448
00:17:59,903 --> 00:18:01,194
對  出城
Well, "Run out of town,"

449
00:18:01,195 --> 00:18:03,254
就是感覺不受歡迎
"Made to feel unwelcome,

450
00:18:03,255 --> 00:18:04,970
不被賞識  都一樣
unappreciated..." Same diff.

451
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:06,771
我覺得不一樣
I don't think it really is the same.

452
00:18:06,772 --> 00:18:07,988
說著容易
That's easy for you to say.

453
00:18:07,989 --> 00:18:10,746
你試試70年代生活在這個小鎮
You try being gay and raising a child

454
00:18:10,895 --> 00:18:12,989
當個同性戀還要養個孩子
in this town in the '70s.

455
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:14,354
說到這個
You know, now that you mention it...

456
00:18:14,355 --> 00:18:17,243
我那一對女同媽媽就是70年代在這把我養大的
my lesbian mothers raised me in this town in the '70s.

457
00:18:17,244 --> 00:18:19,003
雖然  她倆中的一個得打扮成男人
Sure, one of them had to dress up like a man

458
00:18:19,004 --> 00:18:20,733
才帶我去參加父子獨木舟旅行
to take me on the father-son canoe trip,

459
00:18:20,734 --> 00:18:22,010
但她們都挺過來了
but they toughed it out.

460
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,352
不過這都沒什么  因為她本來就有小胡子
It didn't hurt that she already had a mustache

461
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,938
和一柜子的男士衣裝
and a closet full of flannels.

462
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,075
女同
Lesbians.

463
00:18:27,105 --> 00:18:28,919
女同人人愛
Everybody loves lesbians.

464
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,862
你至少可以給她寫封信嘛
You could've at least written her a letter.

465
00:18:31,032 --> 00:18:32,797
但你連個電話都沒打過
Or not even a phone call?

466
00:18:32,922 --> 00:18:35,146
70年代有電話的
They had phones in the '70s.

467
00:18:35,693 --> 00:18:36,721
-沒錯吧  -沒錯
- Right? - Yep. Right.

468
00:18:36,722 --> 00:18:39,476
電話公司跟同性戀...
The phone company and-and gay people...

469
00:18:39,477 --> 00:18:43,468
你分明就是拿同性戀做借口
You're clearly using your homosexuality as an excuse

470
00:18:43,608 --> 00:18:47,726
來掩蓋你拒絕承擔為人父責任的事實
to cover up for your refusal to accept your parental responsibilities.

471
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:49,303
對了  還沒正式介紹
By the way, we haven't met.

472
00:18:49,304 --> 00:18:50,255
我是弗蘭克
I'm Frank.

473
00:18:50,658 --> 00:18:51,400
幸會
It's a pleasure.

474
00:18:51,401 --> 00:18:53,315
再說一遍  納什維爾恨我的人
Once again, the haters of Natesville

475
00:18:53,617 --> 00:18:54,682
都高昂著他們丑惡的頭顱
rear their ugly heads.

476
00:18:54,683 --> 00:18:56,171
你們這群人真有意思
You know, you people are very interesting,

477
00:18:56,172 --> 00:18:58,198
就是不肯悔改
because you don't seem to be able to change, do you?

478
00:18:58,199 --> 00:19:00,612
你才是死不悔改的人吧
Maybe you're the one who hasn't changed.

479
00:19:00,841 --> 00:19:02,614
因為我想了一下
'Cause now that I'm thinking about it,

480
00:19:02,895 --> 00:19:04,275
我們這周做的所有事
everything that we've done this week

481
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:05,996
都是按照你的意愿
has been something you wanted to do.

482
00:19:06,348 --> 00:19:08,303
我們按你的意愿吃了壽司
We had that sushi dinner 'cause you wanted it.

483
00:19:08,304 --> 00:19:09,734
你提議星期二吃玉米卷
You suggested Taco Tuesday.

484
00:19:09,735 --> 00:19:11,316
你不會真想讓我
Do you honestly expect me

485
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:14,242
吃移民擺的路邊攤吧
to eat the street food of a migrant people?

486
00:19:14,243 --> 00:19:16,524
我們看了你挑的法國電影
We went to that French movie 'cause you picked it.

487
00:19:16,525 --> 00:19:18,375
瑞典版的爹已經看過了
Already saw the Swedish version.

488
00:19:18,376 --> 00:19:21,078
你還堅持
And you insisted

489
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:22,908
讓我們拍那個主題的全家福
on the theme for our family picture.

490
00:19:22,909 --> 00:19:25,888
因為我想把照片給我的朋友們看
Because I wanted to share it with my friends.

491
00:19:26,101 --> 00:19:27,026
你還不明白嗎
Don't you understand?

492
00:19:27,027 --> 00:19:30,897
你們穿成平常那樣拍照
Do you honestly expect me to show a photo of-of you guys

493
00:19:30,898 --> 00:19:33,097
你真覺得這種照片拿得出手嗎
dressed the way you normally do?

494
00:19:33,098 --> 00:19:33,934
對不起  我錯了
Forgive me for trying

495
00:19:33,935 --> 00:19:35,735
我不該讓你們顯得更有格調
to raise you to a higher level.

496
00:19:38,688 --> 00:19:40,261
你可以再一次
I think you should leave...

497
00:19:41,024 --> 00:19:42,058
離開了
again.

498
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,069
但這次  是我讓你離開的
But this time, it's my choice.

499
00:19:48,256 --> 00:19:49,457
永別了
Good-bye forever.

500
00:19:52,634 --> 00:19:55,183
這個我要帶走  因為我照得還挺帥的
I'm gonna take this because I look fantastic.

501
00:20:01,427 --> 00:20:03,674
有時候爸爸不在你身旁
Sometimes your dad's not here

502
00:20:03,675 --> 00:20:05,727
有時候你爸是個自私的大...
Sometimes your dad's a big selfish...

503
00:20:05,728 --> 00:20:07,191
歇了吧  雪莉
Quit it, Shelley.

504
00:20:09,617 --> 00:20:12,600
那晚我爸邀請所有人來見我媽的爸爸
Dad invited everyone over that night to meet Mom's father.

505
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:16,154
但原來他們早就認識我媽的爸爸了
But in the end, it turned out they already knew her father,

506
00:20:16,243 --> 00:20:19,033
因為曾爺爺才是我媽的真爸爸
because Paw Paw was Mom's real dad.

507
00:20:28,286 --> 00:20:29,854
真遺憾
I'm sorry your gay father

508
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:32,421
你的基爹原來是個自戀狂魔
turned out to be a narcissist.

509
00:20:33,268 --> 00:20:34,201
你還好吧
You okay?

510
00:20:34,714 --> 00:20:35,511
挺好
Yeah.

511
00:20:36,846 --> 00:20:39,434
其實以前我以為爸爸是個好人
The truth is, I had a pretty good father figure.

512
00:20:40,432 --> 00:20:43,138
所以阿諾德在我小時候就離開也是件好事
And I guess it's good Arnold left when I was a baby.

513
00:20:43,484 --> 00:20:46,353
給我省了多少高檔通心粉啊
Think of all the macaroni art I would have wasted on that guy.

514
00:20:46,956 --> 00:20:47,987
還有手指畫
Finger-paintings.

515
00:20:47,988 --> 00:20:49,931
-煙灰缸  -難看的領帶
- Ashtrays. - Ugly ties.

516
00:20:49,932 --> 00:20:51,684
他可能會給
He probably would've given me zero stars

517
00:20:51,685 --> 00:20:53,643
我為他做的父親節早餐打零分
on the Father's Day breakfast I made him.

518
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:56,758
而且
And besides...

519
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,986
如果我正經有個爹
if I didn't have some daddy issues,

520
00:20:58,987 --> 00:21:01,211
我可能不會15歲就被搞大了肚子
I might not have got knocked up at 15.

521
00:21:01,865 --> 00:21:03,408
那樣如今的我會是什么樣呢
Then where would I be?
