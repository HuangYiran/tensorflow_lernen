00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:35,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well dune.

324
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:39,570


325
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:53,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Answer.

326
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:58,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Brent Magna is both reckless and fearful."

327
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"He is, in short..."

328
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:04,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"...a dangerous driver and should pursue another profession."

329
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:07,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember that review? It wasn't very flattering.

330
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're blind to your real talents...

331
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Which are perfectly suited to my needs.

332
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do I know you?

333
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:17,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know you, Mr. magma...

334
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-and I believe in you.  -Listen.

335
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:22,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need to know when this is all gonna be aver, all right? I need...

336
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing?

337
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:28,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, what are you doing?

338
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:32,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I hate you.  -Yeah, I love you.

339
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:36,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You realize I'll just have to buy another limited edition shelby super snake...

340
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:41,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take another six months to re-time the earns, open up the intake and customize it.

341
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then I'm gonna drive it aver your face.

342
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:47,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You sure know a lot about cars for...  -A girl'?

343
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

344
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:51,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow.

345
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:56,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I like fast cars and computers and bay things, haw butch.

346
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:58,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the 21st century, you should join it.

347
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What are you doing?  -I'm documenting this shit.

348
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not going to jail after we get arrested.

349
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:09,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Well, nobody's gonna get caught, okay'?  -That's right, I forgot.

350
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're just gonna die...

351
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:14,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Because you're a dumb-ass who attacks the police with a damn car."

352
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:16,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}New every cap in this entire country...

353
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:19,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is hoping to put a couple bullets in our heads. Goad plan.

354
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:21,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-We are alive.  -Barely.

355
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not much of a thinker are you?

356
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I didn't actually graduate from charm school like you...

357
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:31,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So maybe someday you can give me some tutoring or something.

358
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:35,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is what he did to my beautiful, beautiful paint jab.

359
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just get in the car.

360
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:41,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is all the crap that he drilled into my carbon fiber interior.

361
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:43,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the dumb-ass who got me into this mess.

362
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:46,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Stop filming me, all right'?  -Wave hi to the judge.

363
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:51,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Say hi to all your new friends in jail.  -Hey! Put that away! I'm trying... just stop it.

364
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:57,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is...? You're like add or something. What are you fiddling with new?

365
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Stop doing that.  -Why'?

366
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:01,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because this guy is watching us, okay?

367
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:04,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I need you to stop...  -I know what I'm doing.

368
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:08,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Dust listen to me for two seconds.   -I know what I'm doing.

369
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:10,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See, I went to school and I know things...

370
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Which is why I don't have to steal stuff, like some people.

371
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:19,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you're so smart, you tell me what's going on with all these cameras, huh?

372
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:29,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're all linked to a single feed.

373
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:33,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not only encrypted, but it's piggybacking on a public server.

374
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:35,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Huh?

375
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:39,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It means they're hosting this live feed from these cameras...

376
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}An a government server without them knowing about it.

377
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:45,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sc anybody can watch it, even us.

378
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:54,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Wait a second.  -What?

379
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-These aren't coming from the same place.  -Where are they coming from?

380
00:29:57,490 --> 00:29:59,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lacks like a parking garage.

381
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:00,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you tell where it is?

382
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. Could be anywhere.

383
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:06,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Do you think it's where he might be'?  -Doubt it. But he can see it.

384
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:08,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't like that he's watching us.

385
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you think you can track him with that thing?

386
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, and if anyone did, he would just dump the ip address.

387
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:17,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As long as his feed is hosted remotely, there's no way to find it.

388
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:20,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-And that thing isn't really well-hidden.  -What?

389
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:21,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Microphone.

390
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Oh, so he's listening to us too'?  -Probably.

391
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:29,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I'll give you this, you are bright.

392
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:33,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's called being educated.

393
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:36,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should look into it when you're not committing crimes.

394
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:39,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Scratch that, you'll be in jail.

395
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, answer.

396
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pull up power plant on the GPS.

397
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:58,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're kind of busy right now.

398
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Learn to multitask.

399
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or let your new little friend help you. Lack under the visor.

400
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:09,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Won't you do that?

401
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm uploading a new set of directions.

402
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's the city power plant.

403
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"At exactly 11:30."

404
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:20,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You will be there.

405
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are we going to the power plant?

406
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:30,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Always so inquisitive.

407
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:32,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I like it.

408
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:44,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen carefully,

409
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:46,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you're to break into the central roam.

410
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:49,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Access the remote system...

411
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-and insert that drive.  -What will that do?

412
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:54,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're a clever girl. I'm sure you'll figure it out.

413
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:00,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He wants to cut the power off. Why do you want to cut the power?

414
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have some time until 11:30.

415
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wouldn't spend it trying to figure out my motives.

416
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's a real asshole.

417
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:49,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you don't know who that is?

418
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:53,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

419
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:56,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-No idea?  -I gut ideas.

420
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:59,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}People I used to work with...

421
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:02,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But nobody I know could set up something like this.

422
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So why you'?

423
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:06,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because I can drive.

424
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:10,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-That's debatable.  -No, I mean, I used to race.

425
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really?

426
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really.

427
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:17,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Professionally, like, real racing.

428
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:19,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't think I ever saw you an TV.

429
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:22,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There was a couple weeks there where you might have.

430
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And?

431
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And what?

432
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I washed out.

433
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How come'?

434
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:42,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know, I just did. Doesn't matter now.

435
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a pretty shitty answer.

436
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:54,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I washed out because I believed everybody who told me haw great I was.

437
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:59,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Turns out the only thing I was great at was wrecking expensive cars.

438
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sc I fell off the pro circuit and I awed a bunch of money.

439
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:05,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the only thing I was ever any good at...

440
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:08,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I took whatever job paid the most.

441
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:13,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I did some things I'm not proud of.

442
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:19,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But then I got out of it. And this...

443
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is why.

444
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:31,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's beautiful.

445
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:36,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Is she from here?  -Yeah.

446
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:40,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She always wanted to came back, so we thought...

447
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:44,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It'd be a good place to lay law and start aver.

448
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:47,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then I came home from work today, the dour is busted open...

449
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:50,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The place is a wreck, there's bland on the floor.

450
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:54,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My cell phone rings and this voice tells me...

451
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if I ever wanna s...

452
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I ever wanna see her again...

453
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I gotta do this jab.

454
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:09,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And if I tell anyone, she'll be dead.

455
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:16,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Next thing I know, I'm driving around in your car.

456
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You souped this thing up yourself?

457
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:26,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, it was a graduation present.

458
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:30,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nice. Something tells me your dad's not a mechanic.

459
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:36,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's the ceo of one of the largest banks in town.

460
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:40,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We moved here about two years ago for him to take it over.

461
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:43,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I barely see him,

462
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but this car is the nicest gift he ever gave me.

463
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:50,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I'm sorry about all the damage.

464
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:57,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, you could also apologize for taking me hostage.

465
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:00,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You could apologize for putting a gun in my face.

466
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I will if you let me out.

467
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's only one thing I'm concerned about right now...

468
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:08,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I'm gonna do whatever I have to to get her back.

469
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:12,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sc if he says you gotta stay in the car, you gotta stay in the car.

470
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:14,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And where does that get you?

471
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why is this happening? What is he after?

472
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:21,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You clearly haven't thought this through.

473
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:26,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happens when this is done and he gets what he wants?

474
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:28,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why would he even give her back to you?

475
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:33,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I were him, I'd kill her and I'd probably kill you.

476
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:34,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit.

477
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:36,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

478
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd probably kill me tan.

479
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:07,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lacks like they've already been here.

480
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If he was already here, why didn't he just take out the power himself?

481
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:14,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know.

482
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop here.

483
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:21,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why?

484
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ever see what happens to a metal car...

485
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When it touches a transformer that powers the whale city?

486
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dust wait here, I'll handle it.

487
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What, alone?

488
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, just be ready to go.

489
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You sure?

490
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:38,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Turn the car around, that's what I should do.

491
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:39,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I should gain after her.

492
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:42,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, she's fine. She knows what she's doing.

493
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,720


494
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:53,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello? I don't have much time.

495
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:55,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm in this car with this man and his wife was kidnapped.

496
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I speak English. Calm yourself.

497
00:38:57,870 --> 00:39:00,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Could you just send someone, please?

498
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:02,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What is your, uh, emergency?  -I don't know.

499
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's this voice telling us what to do. You have to help us.

500
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:08,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Exactly what is your location?  -I'm at the power plant.

501
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:13,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You make it so much fun.  -Shit.

502
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:16,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wherever that clever mind takes you, remember, I've already been there.

503
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look around.

504
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see? That's right.

505
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The police will think you blew up the power station.

506
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:27,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I give you some advice?

507
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Run.

508
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:32,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, come on.

509
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Go, go, go!  -What, what, what?

510
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:42,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Drive, drive! Go!  -What happened?

511
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold on. Shit.

512
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:02,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aah!

513
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:13,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Faster!

514
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:32,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go faster!

515
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:35,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh!

516
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:07,810


517
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:31,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing? What are you doing?

518
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not dying for you.

519
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What happened?  -This is a part of his plan.

520
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:41,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was an camera that whale time.

521
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:44,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He could have taken out the power himself, but he lured us in there...

522
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:47,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Because he wanted me to get caught an camera doing it."

523
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think the caps would ever believe me new?

524
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:54,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Before, it was just you...

525
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This car.

526
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:59,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But new I'm screwed tan.

527
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:02,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.

528
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I gotta take care of myself.

529
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,470


530
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:24,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Answer.

531
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:25,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop her from leaving.

532
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go to hell.

538
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:41,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you okay? Have they hurt you?

539
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:43,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Why is this happening?  -Leanne.

540
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:46,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Please help me! Brent?  -Leanne, are you all right, baby?

545
00:42:57,570 --> 00:43:00,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Put my wife back an! Put her back an!

546
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:02,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is my wife all right?

547
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:07,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told you not to let her out of the car.

548
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I just need to see if she's...  -I warned you.

550
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not your fault.

551
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:40,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know what it's like to disappoint everyone, but I never thought that I'd let her dawn.

552
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's still alive.

553
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't have to do this.

554
00:43:57,330 --> 00:43:58,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want to.

556
00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:39,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We gotta figure out his plan.

557

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}On, shit.

558
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:08,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get dawn, get dawn. Came an.

559
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, okay.

560
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was having you make this.

561
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:50,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're blocking off a path.

562
00:45:50,830 --> 00:45:53,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Half of these are one-way streets.

563
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:57,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With these intersections blacked off, no one will be able to get through here.

564
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:01,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Until they clean this mess up, there'll only be one way out of the city.

565
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:04,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The rest will be a total shit show.

566
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:07,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's an escape route.

567
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:13,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just wish I knew what he was after.

568
00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:16,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You and me bath.

569

570
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is your last assignment.

571
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:40,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look up number five in the GPS.

572
00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:44,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Follow the directions precisely. You have 10 minutes.

573
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the bank.

574
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What bank?

575
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He wants us to rub my dad's bank.

576
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:50,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, shit.

577
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:52,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can't do that.

578
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:54,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do as instructed. The clock is ticking.

579
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:57,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't. There's no way we could do that. The security's way tan tight.

580
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:00,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't concern yourself with security.

581
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:04,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-He wants us to get caught.  -Follow the GPS. Turn around.

582
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is a suicide mission. Listen, we can't do this.

583
00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:08,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ignore her. Listen to me. Turn around now.

584
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:10,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Am I gonna see my wife again?

585
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:11,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Turn around.

586
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:13,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm losing my patience with you.

587
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:14,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen to me.

588
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:15,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

589
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:18,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need to know when I'm going to see my wife.

590
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:20,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, turn the car around.

591
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:20,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is your last warning.

592
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:23,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need to be told that she is all right

593

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and when this shit is gonna be aver!

594
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you want to see her again?

595
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:34,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get control of yourself and turn the car around.

596
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:42,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't do this.

597
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:47,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Listen to me, this is a setup.  -He will kill her.

598
00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:50,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's why they used my car. It had to be me.

599
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:51,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Think about it.

600
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:53,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My dad, he cut off all of my funds.

601
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:56,070

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I'm seen rubbing his bank?

603
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:00,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He wants us to get caught.

604
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:15,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What does he wanna steal?  -Money.

605
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:17,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But that's just it, it's not that kind of bank.

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-God.  -So, what, safety deposit boxes?

610
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:37,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, there's nothing like that in there, just computers.

611
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:41,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Bands. Bearer bands.  -Bearer bands? How old are you?

612
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:45,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is he after, then?

613
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's he trying to steal?

614

617
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:59,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Unless you don't want a record of your money.

618
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:02,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Right, right, like it's dirty money.  -Exactly.

619
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:07,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-How do you move dirty money?  -Look out, look out!

622
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:19,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you stale one of these little transfer keys, right...?

623
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:21,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You could drain the accounts.  -Right.

624
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:25,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No one would report that money stolen, it's not supposed to exist.

625
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:28,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Haw much are we talking about?  -It could be billions.

00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:30,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can understand that.

637
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:00,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What are you doing?  -Dust wait.

638
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:05,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, just sit still and be quiet for a minute.

639
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:20,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, it's dune. I bought us some time.

640
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

641
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:25,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hacked into the server connected to these cameras, put an a loop of us driving.

642
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:27,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-That's what he can see right now.  -Why?

643
00:51:27,850 --> 00:51:29,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sc that you'll listen to me.

644
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:32,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When we get there, we're gonna get caught and your wife will die.

645
00:51:32,650 --> 00:51:34,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're his decays.

646
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Great.  -The powers out...

647
00:51:37,590 --> 00:51:40,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Which means the security infrastructure has been compromised.

648
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:42,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And when that happens, there's a procedure.

649
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:43,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, shit.

650
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:46,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My dad said something about this.

651
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're being moved. They're moving them right now.

652
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:55,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They move anything sensitive to a secure location until the system is back up...

653
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:57,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and then they run a million tests.

654
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}By the time we get there...

655
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:01,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll be rubbing an empty bank.

656
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:03,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please, let's just find a place to lack at it first.

657
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:06,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guarantee you it's swarming with caps.

658
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:09,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How long do we have?

659
00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:11,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know, five, maybe 10 minutes at the mast.

660
00:52:15,330 --> 00:52:17,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Watch where you're going, asshole!

661
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:25,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}?It's the most wonderful time of the year?

662
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:29,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}?With the kids jingle-balling.?

663
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:34,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}?And everyone telling you "be of good cheer".?

664
00:52:34,650 --> 00:52:39,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}?It's the most wonderful time of the year?

665
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:48,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll go check it.

666
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:07,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sc you were right?

667
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:09,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wish I wasn't.

668
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:12,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Se, what do we do new?

669
00:53:13,050 --> 00:53:14,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm thinking.

670
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:17,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You said there was a procedure. If the power goes out,

671
00:53:17,650 --> 00:53:18,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they'll move the drives?

672
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:19,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

673
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:20,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where do they move them?

674
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know, it's classified information for the bank.

675
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:25,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right. Shit.

676
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:29,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But they gotta get picked up. They have to be picked up from here.

677
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:32,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They've got all these caps here waiting for us.

678
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:35,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, what, is there a back door? Is there another entrance?

679
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:45,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember that parking spat that we saw?

680
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:47,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You asked if I thought that's where he was?

681
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:48,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

682
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:50,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I bet he's there now.

683
00:53:56,630 --> 00:53:57,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told you you were bright.
