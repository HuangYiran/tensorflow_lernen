1
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:06,470
拜托  布洛迪
Come on, Brody.

2
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:07,940
除了咱倆  大家都去公司派對了
Everyone's at the company party but us.

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:08,870
快走吧
Let's go.

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:10,120
我還要干活
I have work to do.

5
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:12,750
老兄  曼斯菲爾德說我們可以去30分鐘
Dude, Mansfield said that we could go for 30 minutes, and...

6
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,690
我應該20分鐘前就告訴你的
I should've told you that 20 minutes ago.

7
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:17,550
走吧  一定很屌的
Let's go. It's gonna be beast.

8
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:22,050
你保證再也不說"屌"我就去
Fine, I will go if you promise never to say "beast" again.

9
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:22,920
走吧
Let's go!

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,370
干杯  老兄
Cheers, dog.

11
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:30,400
好
Okay.

12
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:35,480
遲來的
It's was, like, a late--

13
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,390
遲來的酒勁
It was a late one.

14
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:37,300
遲了
It hit late.

15
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,240
這派對真屌
You know, this party is pretty beast.

16
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,170
你剛保證不再說了
You just promised you wouldn't say that.

17
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:46,090
最后一輪
One last round?

18
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:46,990
來吧
Let's do it.

19
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:50,310
我能要杯...
Hey, can I get a... 

20
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,720
老兄  我要兩杯...
Hey, buddy, I just need two...

21
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,240
我就剩一個月的命了
I have one month to live.

22
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,460
我真想要杯...
I'd really like a... 

23
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,420
說你喜歡舊金山49人[橄欖球隊]
Tell me you love the 49ers.

24
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,770
-我的確喜歡舊金山49人  -大聲點
- I do love the 49ers. - Louder.

25
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,440
我喜歡舊金山49人
I love the 49ers.

26
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:08,910
天哪  我愛死49人隊了
God, I love the Niners.

27
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:09,980
今年是屬于他們的
This is their year.

28
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,400
你要什么
What can I get you?

29
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:15,490
我要兩杯酒  一杯龍舌蘭  一杯檸檬糖
I would like to have two shots-- uh, one tequila, one lemon drop.

30
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,080
檸檬糖不是我喝的
The lemon drop's not for me.

31
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,040
我覺得一個男人夠自信
I actually think it's kind of sexy

32
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,930
去點女人的酒喝  還挺性感的
when a guy's confident enough to order a girly drink.

33
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,770
邊上再多加點糖
Could I have some extra sugar on that rim

34
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:26,180
再插頂小傘吧
and maybe one of those little umbrella thingies?

35
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,470
我叫布洛迪  在樓上工作
I'm Brody. I work upstairs.

36
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,460
我叫詹妮  在樓下工作
I'm Jenny. I work downstairs.

37
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,120
你就是樓上那些囂張的
So you're one of those arrogant

38
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,810
全天不停工作的家伙了  是嗎
upstairs guys who works, like, 24/7, yeah?

39
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:36,900
哪有全天不停工作
We don't work that much.

40
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,000
休過假嗎
Ever take time off?

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,200
這就是了
Yeah ,this is it.

42
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,230
我有15分鐘
I have 15 minutes.

43
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,850
這也太沒意思了
Well, that doesn't sound very fun.

44
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,520
沒想過擺脫這一切嗎
Don't you wanna ditch sometimes?

45
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,860
沒有吧  沒找到合適的理由
I don't know. I never found a good reason to, I guess.

46
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,250
老兄
Bro.

47
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,390
曼斯菲爾德剛群發了郵件
Mansfield sent out a mass e-mail.

48
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,010
他要我們馬上回去干活
He wants us all back at work right now.

49
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,410
你怎么看  再來一杯還是...
What do you think? One more drink or...

50
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:54,390
天哪
Oh, Gosh.

51
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,990
不好說  伙計們
I don't know, fellas.

52
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,840
曼斯菲爾德是那種
Is-- is Mansfield one of those

53
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,820
不介意員工無視他的老板嗎
bosses who doesn't mind when you ignore him?

54
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,140
還是那種
Or is he the type of boss 

55
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,070
因為你們決定再喝一杯
that would move your desk into the men's room for a month because

56
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,860
忽視他家傳的祖業
you decided getting one more drink 

57
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,960
而把你們的辦公桌搬去男廁所
was more important than the company he built 

58
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,270
在那放一個月的老板呢
with the blood of his ancestors?

59
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,520
他就是曼斯菲爾德  對吧
He's Mansfield, isn't he?

60
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,640
太對了
He so is.

61
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:24,900
很高興見到你
Nice meeting you.

62
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:25,900
我也是
You, too.

63
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,960
真好  你醒了
Oh, good. You're up.

64
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,230
你猜怎么著
Guess what?

65
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,500
我媽來這附近了  說想跟我吃早午餐
My mom's in the neighborhood, and she wants to go to brunch.

66
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,140
你也會來的  對吧  她覺得你很帥
You'll come, right? She thinks you're so cute.

67
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,010
我給她發了一張你睡覺的照片
I texted her a picture of you sleeping.

68
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,550
開玩笑的啦  伙計
I'm totally kidding, dude.

69
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,450
你真該看看自己的臉
You should've seen your face.

70
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:57,980
太搞笑了
That was pretty damn funny.

71
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,880
我得閃了
Um, I gotta bounce.

72
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:03,810
好的  很隨意  我喜歡
Okay. Keeping it casual. Love it.

73
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:05,870
我們要怎么告別
So how do we say good-bye

74
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,840
而不會感覺這么尷尬和詭異呢
without this feeling so awkward and weird?

75
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,490
昨晚"干"得漂亮
Great work last night?

76
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,690
-是啊  -好
- Hell, yeah. - All right!

77
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,680
門開著還是關上
Open? Closed?

78
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,850
-隨意  -好
- Whatever. - Okay.

00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:49,080
我勾搭的那個女孩還挺不錯的
So, uh, that girl that I hooked up with is pretty cool.

99
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,750
她是公司的后勤
She works for the company support staff.

100
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,720
老兄  你勾搭了底樓的妞兒
Dude, you hooked up with a ground floor chick?

101
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,230
是大冒險嗎
Was it on a dare?

102
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,880
你對我說三道四
You're judging me,

103
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,960
是因為你帶了一張清單
because you carry a list in your pocket 

104
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,770
上面寫的都是你想與之做愛的東西
of stuff you'd like to have sex with.

105
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,010
看啊
Oh, and look.

106
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,750
你劃掉了"大毛絨泰迪熊"
You crossed off "giant stuffed teddy bear". 

107
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,570
我們當時在玩具店
We were in a toy store.

108
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:08,230
你得看看這個
You gotta check this out.

109
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,800
伙計們  快聚過來
Fellas, gather 'round.

110
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:13,310
這部分很無聊  就是接吻而已
Oh, this part's boring. It's mostly just kissing.

111
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,710
很好
Well, this is good.

112
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:21,660
我還擔心你們會浪費晨會之前的
See, I was worried that you'd all waste the five

113
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,290
這五分多鐘
or so minutes before our morning meeting 

114
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,140
研究你們的項目書呢
working on your pitch books.

115
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,320
而我卻看到你們  說真的
Instead, I see something that, honest to God, 

116
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,330
我真想給所有客戶看看
I wish I could show to all our clients 

117
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:36,300
我精心挑選來管理他們錢財的人才
the fine young men I picked to manage their money, 

118
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,070
正聚在一起  看其中一個人
gathered together, watching one of their brethren 

119
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,770
假裝跟玩具做愛
pretend to make love to a toy.

120
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,540
莫耶先生  你不參與嗎
Mr. Moyer, not participating?

121
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,300
我為泰迪熊黯然神傷  先生
I'm too sad for the bear, sir.

122
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:52,580
它是"熊熊工坊"的熊  我們能修好它的
Well, he's a build-a-bear, son. We'll be able to fix him.

123
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:58,300
不過  我說的是周五晚上
Still, I was speaking of Friday night,

124
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,390
你沒回來工作
you never came back to work.

125
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,890
這位小凱爾打了你的小報告
Young Kyle here tattled on you.

126
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,930
我知道  凱爾  我保證過不會說是誰告訴我的
And I know, Kyle, I promised I wouldn't tell who told me.

127
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:07,040
但孩子  我有時會撒謊
But, son, I lie sometimes.

128
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,430
莫耶先生  跟我來陽臺談談吧
Mr. Moyer, join me for one minute out on the balcony, won't you, please?

129
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,510
來點男人之間的對話吧
Let's, uh, let's spark up some guy talk.

130
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,380
不如由我開始
What do you say? I'll lead off.

131
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,060
請坐
Please, have a seat.

132
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,090
49人隊怎么樣
How 'bout those Niners?

133
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,550
你喜歡在這里工作嗎
Do you like working here?

134
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,020
很抱歉我周五晚上翹班了
I'm sorry that I skipped out on Friday night.

135
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:26,880
我只是
I just...

136
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,340
-有個女孩...  -是啊
- There was this girl-- - Ah, yes.

137
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,970
這是每一個悲劇故事的開始
The start of every tragic story.

138
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,480
她在底樓工作...
She works on the ground floor-- 

139
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,940
關于底樓的人有些事你得知道
There's something you need to understand about ground floor people.

140
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,190
他們高中畢業就來這里上班了
You see, they came here right out of high school, 

141
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,080
這輩子都坐在
and they're sitting behind the same desk 

142
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,110
這一張辦公桌后面
that they'll be sitting behind for the rest of their lives.

143
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:50,820
唯一的出路就是找個像你這樣的飯票  莫耶先生
The only way out is to find a meal ticket like you, Mr. Moyer.

144
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,250
她不像是那種人...
Oh, well, she didn't seem like that kind of--

145
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,450
我說完了會給你暗示的  孩子
I'll give you a signal when I'm done talking, son.

146
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,610
現在
Now...

147
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,500
我不想讓我最有前途的理財經理人
I refuse to lose my most promising young money manager

148
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,190
陷入一堆個人問題中
to a sea of personal problems.

149
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,370
你下去告訴她一切結束了
You go down, tell her it's over.

150
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,600
客氣點  不過要說清楚
Be nice, but be clear.

151
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,560
你現在笑得跟傻子一樣
I assume you're grinning like an idiot right now 

152
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,440
是因為我剛說"最有前途"了
because I said "most promising" earlier?

153
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:11,210
是的
I am.

154
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,690
站起來
Stand up.

155
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:17,160
離開我的陽臺以后再歡天喜地吧
Please don't celebrate till you've left my balcony.

156
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,010
難以置信你
I can't believe you slept

157
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,030
跟樓上那種無情的家伙滾床單了
with one of those soulless upstairs guys.

158
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:38,010
我的一夜情鬧鐘響了  行嗎
My one-night stand alarm went off, okay?

159
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,350
我只允許自己半年這么做一次
I only let myself do those biannually.

160
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,710
我當時情緒很不正常
I was in a weird mood.

161
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,870
我媽把我從小長大住的屋子賣了
My mom sold the house I grew up in.

162
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:46,810
在哪的
Where was it?

163
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:47,840
四處跑
Everywhere.

164
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,420
是輛房車
It's an RV.

165
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:55,400
我以前會把我家開去高中  太酷了
It was cool sometimes I used to drive my house to high school. 

166
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,640
你呢  德里克
How about you, Derrick?

167
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,860
派對上勾搭到妹子了嗎
You hook up at the party?

168
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,220
我勾搭了一個古巴翹臀妞
Oh, man, I got me a little Cuban chick.

169
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,240
魔鬼身材
Slammin' bod.

170
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,540
奶頭堪稱一絕  伙計
I mean, she had some fiesta titties, man!

171
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:08,920
真好  她叫什么
Sweet. What's her name?

172
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,000
我騙你的
I didn't meet nobody.

173
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,880
你不是不會再一直講大話了嗎
I thought you were gonna try to stop lying all the time.

174
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,430
我就是忍不住要說第一個謊
Yeah, man, I can't stop the first lie.

175
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,390
我這人就這樣
That's just who I am.

176
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:18,050
不過詹妮讓我在別人
Jenny's making me work on coming clean 

177
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:19,540
繼續提問時說出真相
if somebody asks a follow-up question, though.

178
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,200
所以別再問了
So please, no follow-up questions.

179
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,990
你弟沒給我們拿到季后賽的票子吧
So I take it your brother's not getting us playoff tickets?

180
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,050
不  他當然拿到了
No, dude, he's definitely gonna get the tickets.

181
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,610
他真的拿到了嗎
Is he really getting the tickets?

182
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,360
當然是假的
Hell, no, man!

183
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,390
布洛迪
Brody!

184
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,390
我之前都不知道這下面有辦公室
I didn't even know there were offices down here.

185
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,280
好熱
Wow, it's hot.

186
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,520
是啊  因為整棟樓的
Oh, yeah, that's 'cause all

187
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,750
電力設備都在這后面
the building's electrical equipment's back there.

188
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:44,230
我很肯定我們都生不出孩子了
I'm pretty sure none of us can have babies.

189
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,720
我想解釋一下那晚的事
Look, I wanted to explain something about the other night.

190
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,640
別擔心
Don't sweat it, okay?

191
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,410
每個人在床上都有怪癖
Everybody's got weird sex stuff.

192
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:51,540
我喜歡眼神接觸
I like eye contact, 

193
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,520
而你喜歡射了之后喊一聲"耶以"
and you like to yell "Yahtzee!" when you finish.

194
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,430
怎么了  我忍不了
What? I can't help it.

195
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,760
我一有性趣就會喊"耶以"
I say "Yahtzee" when get turned on.

196
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,360
大伙兒
Hey, guys.

197
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,510
抱歉遲到了
Sorry I'm late.

198
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,730
昨晚我跟我的基友出去跳舞
Last night I was out dancin' with my gays till...

199
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,030
跳到現在
well, now.

200
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:11,010
去換工作服
Changing to my work clothes.

201
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,430
這是樓上的家伙嗎
Is this the upstairs guy?

202
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,900
你看著像個傻逼
You look like a tool.

203
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,300
友好點
Be nice.

204
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,290
好吧
Okay.

205
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,070
你看起來像個傻逼喲
You look like a tool!

206
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,430
好多了
All better.

207
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,300
爽呆了
Ooh, that was awesome.

208
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,830
抱歉  我應該告訴你我在里面的
I'm sorry. I should've said I was in there. 

209
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:34,890
是我不對
That's my bad.

210
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,430
無所謂了
Whatever, man.

211
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:38,440
很高興我終于來上班了
I'm just glad I'm finally at work.

212
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,470
得睡會兒
Gotta get some sleep.

213
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,790
好了  我就是想...
Anyway, I just wanted to ta-- 

214
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,310
后勤部
Building support.

215
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,220
來吧
Come on.

216
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,750
我們出去聊一會兒
Let's step outside, chat for a second.

217
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,670
不用了  伙計
No thanks, man.

218
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,560
來吧
Aw, come on.

219
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,630
透露點詹妮的事給你
I'll give you the scoop on Jenny.

220
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,970
喜歡這招啊
Oh, he liked that.

221
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,290
兄弟們  要不要雪茄
Hey, fellas. Uh, anybody want a cigar?

222
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,370
太惡心了
That's disgusting.

223
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:07,080
確定不要
Are you sure?

224
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,730
這是天上掉下來的雪茄
They are falling from the sky.

225
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,890
還點著呢
Oh! Still lit.

226
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,450
也就是說是剛掉下來的
That means it's fresh.

227
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,100
現在告訴你詹妮的事
Now here is the scoop on Jenny.

228
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:19,270
離她遠點
Stay away from her.

229
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,260
她愛我
She loves me.

230
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:22,840
我們現在處于戀愛中的神奇時刻
We're just in that magical time

231
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,570
而且她還不知道咱倆在戀愛
in a relationship before she knows she's in one.

232
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:30,520
你和詹妮還會做什么想象中的事
What other imaginary things do you and Jenny do together, huh?

233
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,490
海邊漫步嗎
You go on long walks by the ocean?

234
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,890
還是去那種DIY酸奶店
Go to one of those build-your-own-yogurt places,

235
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,170
她在鼻子上放顆櫻桃
and then she puts a cherry on her nose?

236
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:38,350
你再一口吃掉  但這樣又太冷了
You bite it off, right? But now you're too cold.

237
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,080
所以你們又去咖啡店了
Now you guys go to that coffee hut.

238
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,680
你點了豆奶拿鐵
You get your soy latte on, right?

239
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,420
因為她有乳糖不耐癥
Because she can't digest dairy.

240
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,080
然后你說"我愛你  親愛的"
And then you say, "I love you, honey." 

241
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:47,160
她凝視著你的雙眸
And she looks right back at you.

242
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,980
然后怎么樣
And then what happens?

243
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:00,250
淡定點  哈佛生
Calm down, Harvard.

244
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,720
你怎么知道我是哈佛畢業的
How'd you know that I went to Harvard?

245
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,050
他叫我呢  小帥哥
Uh, he was talking to me, fancy pants.

246
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,630
我們叫他"哈佛生"  因為他上過大學
We call him "Harvard" 'cause he went to college.

247
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:14,710
一所很有競爭力的社區大學
A very competitive community college.

248
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:19,470
那是24個月的課程  而我22個月就完成了
It's a 24-month program, and I actually finished it in 22.

249
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,970
你要談什么
So what'd you need to talk about?

250
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,620
我是想跟你私下談談的
I was actually hoping to do this a little more privately.

251
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,460
"私下談談"
"Do this more privately."

252
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:33,540
周五晚上很棒
Friday night was great,

253
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,020
你真的很貼心  但是...
and you're a really sweet girl, but...

254
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:39,560
你帶美瞳了嗎
Do you wear colored contacts?

255
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,410
你的眼睛好藍
They're so blue.

256
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,350
管他呢
The hell with it.

257
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,680
我們處得很開心
We both had a great time.

258
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,090
應該再一起出去玩
We should go out again.

259
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,870
不了  謝謝  不過謝謝你的邀請
No, thanks. But thank you for asking.

260
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,740
你剛才真的拒絕我了嗎
Did you seriously just turn me down?

261
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,620
是的  我們都聽到了
Yeah, she did, and we all heard it.

262
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,580
所以  拜拜了您啊
So... Good-bye!

263
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,720
我不會跟樓上的人約會的
I would never date an upstairs guy.

264
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,170
我老板說你們這種人的夢想
My boss told me it was like your dream

265
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:04,680
就是和像我這樣的男人約會
to date a guy like me.

266
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,480
你和老板閑來無事  討論我們想跟誰約會嗎
So you and your boss sit around and talk about who we want to date?

267
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,930
我就說樓上的人根本不做事的
I told you they don't actually do anything up there.

268
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,430
買  買  賣  賣
Buy! Buy! Sell! Sell!

269
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,300
你新買的馬怎么樣了
Hey, how's your new horse?" 

270
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,530
不是每個人都有馬的
We don't all have horses, man.

271
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:22,330
證明啊
Prove it.

272
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:25,140
我不知道要怎么證明我沒有馬
I don't know how to prove I don't have a horse.

273
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,910
布洛迪  這真的與你無關
Look, Brody, it's really not about you, okay?

274
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:35,250
就是你們樓上的人好像都有些
It just seems like you upstairs guys are just kind of, um...

275
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:36,810
可悲
sad.

276
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:38,700
可悲  什么
Sad?! What?!

277
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,980
哪里可悲了
How are we sad?

278
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,750
也許是因為你太吵了
Maybe you're sad 'cause you're so loud.

279
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,160
感覺你們從不玩樂
It just seems like you never have any fun, you know?

280
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,990
我們工作是很辛苦  但是在這里
I mean, we work hard, but down here, it's just...

281
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,770
沒那么緊張  你明白嗎
It's not as uptight, you know?

282
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:54,020
比如來了一首好歌
Like, if a great song comes on...

283
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:57,440
*我們要跳舞休息  你知道嗎*
*We're gonna have a dance break, you know*

284
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,530
*布洛迪  你知道嗎*
*Brody, do you know*

285
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:01,470
*你知道嗎  知道嗎  布洛迪你知道嗎*
*Do you know? You know? Brody, do you know*

286
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,410
好討厭  行了  耶以
That's very unpleasant. Okay. Yahtzee.

287
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,300
抱歉
Sorry.

288
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,750
別人開心你就不開心嗎
Did you get mad because all the people seemed happy?

289
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:13,150
你真是個可愛的呆子
You're a cute little nerd.

290
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:16,070
我要回去工作了
I'm gonna go back to work, okay?

291
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,480
快騎著馬兒回去吧
Yeah, why don't you ride your horse back?

292
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,590
老子要殺了你
Hey, I will kill you!

293
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,470
跳舞休息  伙計
Dance break, man!

294
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:37,400
-要不要一起來  -不要
- You want in on this? - No.

295
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,620
-不要嗎  -不要
- No? - No.

296
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:41,610
*三連冠  三連冠  走在街上*
*Threepeat, threepeat, on the street*

297
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:44,960
*三連冠  冠呀么冠呀么冠冠冠*
*Threepeat, peat, peat, on the repeat, peat, peat*

298
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,710
*三連冠  三三三連冠*
*Threepeat, three, three, threepeat*

299
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:49,590
我就叫這名字
That's my name.

300
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,350
-好  -好了  停下
- Okay. - Okay, stop!

301
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,960
這里是辦公場所好嗎
This is a place of business, man.

302
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,310
拜托  哥們
Oh, come on, man!

303
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,210
陪布洛迪跳超屌的舞蹈  給人家點樂子啊
Fun brody up in this beast!

304
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:01,100
別工作了  出去吧
Let's ditch work and get outta here.

305
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,260
去哪兒呢  莫耶先生
And go where, Mr. Moyer?

306
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:07,130
去那間更容易工作的房間
Uh, to that room where it's easier to work.

307
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:08,750
特殊工作房
The special workroom.

308
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,090
請到我辦公室來
My office, please.

309
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,630
自動開門
Automatic door remote.

310
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,010
真是太屌了  先生
That's very beast, sir.

311
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,230
謝謝
Thank you.

312
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,620
給你一小時想個新的口頭禪
You have one hour to come up with a new word.

313
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,430
是  先生
Yes, sir.

314
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:24,130
真的抱歉
I'm really sorry.

315
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:27,280
-我只是  -看見我在辦公室里貼的這些詞了嗎
- I just-- - See all these words that I've posted around the office?

316
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,720
有沒有想過我為什么偏偏挑了這幾個詞
Do you ever wonder why I picked those particular words?

317
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:33,460
因為這些詞是你希望我們擁有的品質嗎
Because they're all qualities that you would like us to have?

318
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,270
不是
No.

319
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,750
是因為我用這些詞來描述自己
It's because they're all words I use to describe myself.

320
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,630
而且我發現那樣很...
And I find that...

321
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,440
讓人印象深刻
impressive.

322
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:49,390
來
Come.

323
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:53,840
先生  樓下的姑娘搞昏了我的頭
Sir, that girl downstairs messed with my head.

324
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,680
跟她講話就像喝龍舌蘭一樣
Talking to her is like drinking tequila.

325
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:57,510
前一秒鐘  你還覺得一切都在你掌握之中
One second, you think you're totally in control.

326
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:00,490
接下來你就發現自己光著躺在院子里
And then the next thing you know, you wake up naked in the yard,

327
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:02,960
而你媽媽一直說你毀了圣誕節
and your mom keeps saying that you've ruined Christmas.

328
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,310
這姑娘害我質疑我整個人生
This girl's got me questioning my whole life.

329
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,460
你給自己找了個生活復雜者  對吧
You got yourself a life-unraveler, don't you?

330
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,640
那姑娘說的話
That's a girl who says things that 

331
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:18,750
讓你從全新  大部分是消極的角度看待生活
makes you look at your life in a whole new and mostly negative way.

332
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,380
是啊
Yes.

333
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,720
她讓我覺得我的生活很空虛  我光顧著工作
She made me feel like my life is empty, that all I do is work.

334
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,530
我說不好  也許她是對的
I don't know. Maybe she's right. 

335
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,260
也許我沒盡情玩樂
Maybe I'm not having any fun.

336
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,720
你覺得我有盡情玩樂嗎  莫耶先生
You think I have fun, Mr. Moyer?

337
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,640
你在國慶節燒烤上喝了個爛醉
Well, you got drunk at the 4th of July barbecue,

338
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,900
而且你和你妻子在充氣城堡上做愛
and you and your wife had sex in the bouncy castle.

339
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:39,870
我真愛美國  莫耶先生
I love America, Mr. Moyer.

340
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,430
孩子  我富得流油
Son, I am crazy rich.

341
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,280
我一周上三天班
I work three days a week.

342
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,940
五年來我都沒錯過我女兒的排球賽
I haven't missed my daughter's volleyball game in five years.

343
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:52,440
只要我想  就帶我的家人去度假
And I take my family on vacation whenever I want to.

344
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,530
你知道我為什么擁有那一切嗎
And do you know why I have all of those things?

345
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,440
因為我在四十歲之前真的拼死命了
Because I literally busted my ass until I was 40.

346
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,620
當然  底樓的人們現在很享樂
And sure, some of these ground floor people have fun now,

347
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,340
但十年后他們會怎樣
but where are they gonna be in ten years?

348
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:07,170
一事無成  想盡辦法交房租  前途無"亮"
Nowhere. Struggling to make rent with no future. 

349
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:08,660
我現在告訴你
And I'm telling you right now,

350
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,990
那可不如海濱別墅好玩
that's not as much fun as a beach house.

351
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,260
或是一匹馬
Or a horse.

352
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,330
我真不敢相信我讓那姑娘玩弄了我
I can't believe I let that girl twist me up.

353
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:20,400
以后不會了
But no more.

354
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:21,780
你知道你是什么嗎  先生
You know what you are, sir?

355
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,040
你是生活解謎者
You're a life-raveler.

356
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,470
對  我就是
Yes, I am.

357
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,890
這句話絕對要上墻啊
And that's damn sure going up on the wall.

358
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,610
先生  你讓我找一個"屌"的替換詞
Sir, in regards to finding a replacement word for "Beast,"

359
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,870
你覺得"帥呆了"怎么樣
what are your thoughts on "Fandango?" 

360
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,080
我非常喜歡
I like that a great deal.

361
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:45,840
我想告訴你們所有人
I would like to let you all know 

362
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,730
我不會再來了
that I will not be coming back here anymore.

363
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:48,610
哈哈
Ha ha.

364
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:53,060
我覺得現在你下來的次數比我們都多了
I feel like at this point you're down here more than we are.

365
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,110
好啊  樓上的悲劇男
Hey, sad upstairs dude.

366
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,560
你們知道嗎
You know what?

367
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,240
我可不悲劇
I am not sad, okay.

368
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,700
你們知道誰的生活很可悲嗎  你們的
You know whose lives are sad? Yours. 

369
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,980
你們都在一直假裝你們很開心
You all keep pretending you're happy, 

370
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:05,240
我現在要去樓上建筑我的未來
and I'm gonna go upstairs and build my future 

371
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,760
得到我的海濱別墅  因為顯然那些都很有趣
and get my Beach House, because apparently they're very fun.

372
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:13,080
真好真好真的好
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well.

373
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:19,690
這位"希望有我的絡腮胡先生"覺得他比我們都強
Mr. Wishes-he-had-my-beard thinks he's better than all of us.

374
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:23,220
我穿上一套西裝  明天就能干你的活兒
I could put a suit on and do your job tomorrow.

375
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:24,300
我今天就能做
I could do it today,

376
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,380
但我得先找我爸爸借套西裝
but I would need to borrow a suit from my dad first.

377
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,660
好了  聽完了最后一句瘋話
Okay, and on that final insane note,

378
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,920
我現在要說再見了  終于解脫了
I will now say good-bye and good riddance.

379
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,150
這什么眼神  你為什么這樣看我
What is that look? Why are you giving me that look? 

380
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:38,670
我真的很擔心你會為你剛才所說的話
I'm just really worried that you're gonna feel bad 

381
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,350
覺得難過
about the stuff you just said, 

382
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,580
我想讓你知道  我原諒你
and I want you to know that I forgive you.

383
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,360
別問她問題了  布洛迪
Stop asking her questions, Brody!

384
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:49,240
你經常和自己說話啊
You talk to yourself a lot.

385
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,600
無視她
Ignore her.

386
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:09,340
我知道我這么晚還過來有些詭異
I know it's weird, me coming here this late.

387
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:12,550
不  詹妮  一點也不詭異  我也一直在想你
No, Jenny, it's not weird at all. I can't stop thinking about you either.

388
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:25,100
我來是因為我把圍巾落這兒了
I just came 'cause I left my scarf.

389
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:28,470
好好好  快請進
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on. Come on in. 

390
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,110
沒問題
Sure, sure, sure.

391
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:32,830
太棒了  你找到了
Oh, good. You found it. 

392
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:33,510
是啊  回頭見
Yeah. See ya.

393
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,350
除非我先見到你  姑娘
Aw, not if I don't see you first, girl.

394
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,810
-什么  -什么
- What? - What?

395
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:40,280
-好吧  -行啊 
- Okay. - Sure. 

396
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:41,790
冷靜
Yeah, peace!

397
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,730
我說  "我唯一乘坐商用飛機的可能性
And I said, "The only way I'm flying commercial is 

398
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:55,510
就是他們為私人飛行拍攝廣告
if they're shooting a commercial about flying privately."

399
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,510
{\an8}commercial既有商用飛機也有廣告的意思

400
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,060
這家伙懂我的梗
This guy gets it.

401
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:00,800
新來的是誰
hey, who's the new guy?

402
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,070
他剛來這里上班
He just started here.

403
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,470
從高盛投資公司過來的
Came over from Goldman.

404
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:05,500
我們今天盡量做到最好的自己吧
Let's try to be the best version of ourselves out there today.

405
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,080
好嗎  哥幾個
All right, fellas?

406
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,690
畢竟我們玩的不只是錢
I mean, after all, it's not just money we're playing with.

407
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,190
還有人們的性命
It's also people's lives.

408
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,280
那是個玩笑  我不知道你們這么憤世嫉俗
That's a joke. I didn't realize how cynical you all are. 

409
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,710
你們壞透了  你們簡直是壞人
You're horrible. You're actually horrible people.

410
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,730
新來的
Hey, new guy.

411
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:22,160
我可以和你去走廊聊一聊嗎
Can I actually talk to you out in the hallway, please?

412
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,080
什么事  頭兒
What's the problem, chief?

413
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,220
你感受到了
Do you feel...

414
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:27,150
我的威脅嗎
threatened by me?

415
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:28,810
我明白
I get it.

416
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:31,270
一直要做到最好壓力很大
It's a lot of pressure having to be the best all the time.

417
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:32,770
你爸媽是亞洲人
You've got Asian parents.

418
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:33,920
你懂我的意思
You know what I'm talking about.

419
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,900
你什么時候在高盛投資公司做的
Hey, uh, when were you at Goldman?

420
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,800
我在那待了兩年  不記得你啊
I was there for two years. I don't remember you.

421
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:43,300
抱歉  我們需要立馬談談
You know what? Sorry. We actually need to talk right now.

422
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,560
行啊
Okay.

423
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,350
看來他想帶我去看看他的馬
Guess he wants to show me his horse.

424
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,030
關于壓力  他說得對
He's right about the pressure, you know.

425
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:52,470
我父母還逼我上小提琴課
My parents still make me take violin lessons.

426
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,650
我什么時候才能稱他們的心啊
When will I ever be good enough for them?

427
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,340
攻蛋
Ball tap.

428
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:03,870
他們完全信了
They totally bought it.

429
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,600
天啊  我覺得生機"勃"發
God, I feel alive.

430
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,060
我好像勃起了
I think I have an erection.

431
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,590
真的哎
Yes, I do.

432
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:16,130
你意識到那樣有多蠢嗎
Do you even realize how dumb that was?

433
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:19,070
曼斯菲爾德一進來  你就立馬會被炒掉
The second Mansfield came in, your ass would've been fired.

434
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,980
總比不上親一個站在那兒的女孩蠢吧
Well, it's not as dumb as kissing a girl 

435
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,930
她甚至都沒有回吻你
who just stands there and doesn't even kiss you back.

436
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,210
詹妮不止是站在那兒
Jenny didn't just stand there.

437
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:26,430
她回吻我了
She kissed me back.

438
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:27,980
等等
Wait.

439
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,760
她回吻我了
She kissed me back.

440
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,690
現在軟了
Well, it's gone now.

441
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,150
你回吻我了
You kissed me back.

442
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,200
什么
What?

443
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,120
你的嘴唇動的程度和我的一樣
Your lips moved just as much as mine,

444
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,690
你的舌頭在到處亂攪
and your tongue was everywhere.

445
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,830
我的舌頭只是在躲你的舌頭
My tongue was just hiding from your tongue.

446
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:46,810
真的嗎
Really?

447
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,050
在我的嘴里躲藏嗎
It was hiding in my mouth?

448
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:49,400
那真是個糟糕的躲藏地點  
That's a bad hiding spot 

449
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,360
因為我的舌頭馬上就找到它了
because my tongue found it right away.

450
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:54,970
你就直接承認你回吻我了唄
Will you just admit that you kissed me back?

451
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:56,750
我當然回吻了你  布洛迪
Of course I kissed you back, Brody.

452
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,600
我有禮貌
I'm not rude.

453
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:00,320
如果別人吻了我  我總是會回吻
If somebody kisses me, I always kiss back.

454
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,790
詹妮  我們可以去小房間里談談嗎
Jenny, can I talk to you in the closet for a second?

455
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:07,600
你就是不能承認我們有交流  對吧
You can't admit it, can you, that we connected?

456
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,160
我只是想拿回我的圍巾
I just wanted my scarf back.

457
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,240
你在晚上十一點要圍巾干嘛
What did you want with a scarf at 11:00 at night?

458
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,560
怎么  你是圍巾警察嗎
What are you, the scarf police?

459
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:16,950
你知道我怎么想嗎
You know what I think?

460
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:18,570
我覺得你喜歡我
I think you like me.

461
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:20,940
我覺得你喜歡我很成功
I think you like that I'm successful.

462
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,410
我覺得你喜歡我坦誠
I think you like that I'm honest.

463
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,490
但我不是那種你覺得自己該喜歡的男人
But I'm not the guy that you think you're supposed to like,

464
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,150
所以你很糾結
and that's got you all twisted up.

465
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:30,380
這是事實  我倆都知道
And that's the truth, and we both know it.

466
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,470
你過生日  今晚要做點什么好玩的事嗎
Are you doing anything fun for your birthday tonight?

467
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,310
你怎么知道是我生日
How'd you know it was my birthday?

468
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:42,320
我們在一起的第一晚
Um, the first night that we got together,

469
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:43,830
我翻了你的錢包
I looked through your wallet.

470
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,190
拿走一些錢  我就那樣
Taking some cash. I do that.

471
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:52,250
我想不起你的名字  所以我看了下你的執照
I couldn't rember your name, so I looked at your license.

472
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,610
"卡羅爾"這中間名可真娘  哥們
"Carol" is a rough middle name, bro.

473
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:57,370
在你生日那天
Well, on your birthday,

474
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:00,070
曼斯菲爾德帶你出去吃牛排  喝威士忌
Mansfield takes you out for steak and scotch.

475
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,380
不錯啊  好玩嗎
Cool. Is that fun?

476
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,730
這是強制性的
Well, it's kind of mandatory.

477
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,750
就像一年去看一次牙醫
It's like going to the dentist once a year.

478
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,450
你去看牙醫
You go to the dentist.

479
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:09,430
我們知道  少炫耀了
We get it. You know, quit bragging. 

480
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:13,990
你上次過生日時做了點好玩的事是什么時候
Well, when was the last time you did something fun for yo birthday?

481
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:15,940
那個
Well...

482
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,150
在我18歲的生日時
on my 18th birthday, 

483
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,170
在我爸爸過世之前
right before my dad passed away, 

484
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,740
他帶我去了一家鋼琴酒吧
he took me to this piano bar.

485
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,010
他偷偷帶我進去
He snuck me in.

486
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:25,630
讓我喝了幾瓶啤酒
He let me have a few beers.

487
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:30,710
他整晚都在彈奏艾爾頓·約翰[英國歌手]的歌曲
And, uh, he played Elton John songs all night on the piano.

488
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:34,550
我還唱了其中一支  大家都跟我合唱
I actually sang one of them, and, uh, everyone joined in.

489
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:37,560
真的很棒
It was really awesome.

490
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,880
聽起來也很棒
Sounds really awesome.

491
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:44,330
我們下班后要去街上的潛水酒吧
We go to that dive bar up the street after work.

492
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:45,540
你該和我們一起去
You should come with us.

493
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,900
是啊  和我們一起去  玩一玩
Yeah, come with us. Have some fun. 

494
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,010
-來吧  哥們  -出去逛逛
- Come on, man. - Get on out. 

495
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:50,920
不去也行  要是你很忙
Or don't, you know, if you're busy.

496
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,310
我不能去  我沒得選擇
I can't. Uh, it's not really my choice. 

497
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,170
如果你改變主意了  我們六點出發
If you change your mind, we leave here at 6:00.

498
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,490
布洛迪  等等
Hey, Brody. Wait.

499
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:08,150
關于你爸爸的那件事...
That, uh, that thing about your dad...

500
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:10,150
今晚別來
Don't come tonight.

501
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:21,200
今晚要吃生日牛排  喝威士忌
Oh, birthday steaks and scotch tonight.

502
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,360
誰準備好了  小伙子們
Who's ready, boys?

503
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,360
我們打算先做完
We're just gonna finish this

504
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,720
利率投影的設計概要
client brief on interest rate projections...

505
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,570
然后我們就出發
and then we will head out.

506
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:30,760
在自己的生日派對上遲到
Going late to his own birthday party.

507
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,960
女士們  先生們  布洛迪·莫耶回歸正軌了
Ladies and gentlemen, Brody Moyer is back on track.

508
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,160
你們知道為什么嗎
And do you know why?

509
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:41,600
生活解謎者

510
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:43,500
不用謝
You're welcome.

511
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,100
這張桌子邊少了三把椅子
There's, like, three chairs missing from this table.

512
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:52,590
這些椅子棒極了
These chairs are fantastic!

513
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:55,380
你感覺好像要摔倒了  但其實不會
It's like you're about to fall, and then you don't.

514
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,150
就像  天啊  我沒事
Like, oh, my god! Oh, I'm fine. 

515
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,830
好了  六點過二十了
All right, it's 20 after.

516
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,380
我們該走了  因為他不會來了
That means it's time to go because he's not coming.

517
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,810
我只是  我想再等一會兒
I just--I wanna wait a little bit longer.

518
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,870
如果我們等得太久
Look, if we wait too long, 

519
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,230
那個覺得我很萌
the bartender who thinks I'm cute 

520
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:11,570
用我抱抱換他飲料的酒保就會走了
and trades me drinks for hugs is gonna be gone, 

521
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,280
調酒的就是那個女酒保了
and then the girl bartender's gonna be there.

522
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:17,560
好吧  我們可以走了
Okay, fine. We can go.

523
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,950
這家伙有什么重要的啊
What's the big deal about this guy anyways?

524
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:22,620
他只是另一個無情的樓上傻逼
He's just another soulless, upstairs tool.

525
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,530
不
No.

526
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:26,160
他很善良啊  他救了你
He's got a soul, man. He rescued you. 

527
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,360
其他人會
All those other guys would've

528
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,730
讓你被炒掉  然后嘲笑你
let you get fired and then laughed at you.

529
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,780
也許吧  也許他有點善良
Well, maybe. Maybe he has a little bit of soul.

530
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:35,800
德里克  走吧  托麗都走了
Yo, Derrick, let's go! Tori's already gone. 

531
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,260
什么  真的嗎
What?! Really?! 

532
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:44,260
*祝你生日快樂*
*Happy birthday to you*

533
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:47,810
*祝你生日快樂*
*Happy birthday to you*

534
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:49,240
他們在對誰唱歌呢
Who are they singing to?

535
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:53,910
*生日快樂  親愛的布洛迪*
*Happy birthday, dear Brody*

536
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:58,330
*祝你生日快樂*
*Happy birthday to you*

537
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,410
他們都不知道我不在
They don't even know I'm not there.

538
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,880
真抱歉  哥們  別難過
I'm sorry, man. Don't be sad. 

539
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,930
我等下用小提琴給你拉生日快樂歌
I'll play it for you later on my violin.

540
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,790
我去拿幾瓶啤酒
I'll grab some beers.

541
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,250
謝謝  我不要了
No, thanks. I'm good. 

542
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,850
如果我有兒子  他可能也會那樣
You know, if I had a son, he'd probably be just like that.

543
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:20,780
你說什么  先生
Excuse me, sir?

544
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:22,840
沒什么
Nothing.

545
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:23,860
只是很有意思
It's just interesting.

546
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:26,380
有時候年輕人會無視你的愿望
Sometimes a young man can ignore your wishes,

547
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:27,950
然后你反而更尊重他
and you end up respecting him more.

548
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:31,750
美食精神

549
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,180
好了  好了
Okay. All right. 

550
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,860
留著下次再抱吧
Save a little for next time.

551
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:37,440
好
All right.

552
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,800
他居然來了
No way! He came! 

553
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:47,120
-你好  卡羅爾  -生日快樂  布洛迪
- Hey, Carol! - Happy birthday, Brody! 

554
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,400
謝謝
Thank you.

555
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:49,820
我就知道你會來
I knew you would come.

556
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,780
你不知道
No, you didn't.

557
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:54,460
如果我不知道  為什么我讓他們搬出舊鋼琴呢
If I didn't know, why did I have them bring the old piano out?

558
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,070
還記得嗎  上次那個過得開心的生日
You remember? The last time you had fun on your birthday. 

559
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:59,880
記得  但那架鋼琴一直在那里  對吧
Yeah, but that piano's here all the time though, isn't it?

560
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,090
你以前來過這里嗎
Have you ever been here before?

561
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,880
-沒有  -那就不是
- No. - Then no, it's not. 

562
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:05,750
上吧  德里克  來
You're up, Derrick. Let's go.

563
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,800
來吧
Here we go.

564
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,890
等等  你會彈鋼琴嗎
Hold on a second. You can play piano?

565
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:10,470
不會
No.

566
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:12,450
但我能彈點東西
But, you know, I can do a little somethin' somethin'.

567
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:17,320
-那是艾爾頓·約翰的歌  對吧  -是啊
- That's Elton John, isn't it? - Yes.

568
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,290
你該跟著唱啊
So you should sing.

569
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,290
不不  那太荒唐了
No, no. That's ridiculous. 

570
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:20,810
快來唱吧
Yes! Come on!

571
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,030
上去吧
Get up there!

572
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:24,290
各位  我真的不想成為關注的對象...
Guys, I really don't like being the center of--

573
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:27,250
*你能告訴所有人*
*And you can tell everybody*

574
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:30,570
*這是你的歌*
*This is your song*

575
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:34,810
*也許很簡單  但是*
*It may be quite simple, but...*

576
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,780
*現在已經成曲*
*Now that it's done*

577
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,960
*我希望你別介意*
*I hope you don't mind*

578
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,620
*我希望你別介意*
*I hope you don't mind*

579
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:46,270
*我用語言表達*
*That I put down in words*

580
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:50,720
*生活有多么美好*
*How wonderful life is*

581
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,640
*因為有你在其中*
*Now you're in the world*

582
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,360
他唱得好爛
He's horrible.
