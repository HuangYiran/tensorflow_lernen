我需要帮忙 感觉不太好
I need help man. I don't feel good.

31
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,400
我在唐人街的什么地方 一个小巷子里
I'm in Chinatown somewhere, some alleyway.

32
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,400

卧底游戏 第一季 第八集

34
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,690
我们应该再睡一会儿 你说呢?
We should probably get some sleep, don't you think?

35
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,390
是的 我们是应该多睡一会儿
Yeah, we should probably get on that.

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,900
怎么了?
What?

37
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,670
怎么了?
What?

38
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:03,340
这么说我算哪一个?
So which is it?

39
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:04,910
是你男朋友还是
Am I your boyfriend, or

40
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:08,340
那个什么 你知道的
is this just... you know.

41
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:11,550
我们在认真的谈这事吗?
Are we having "the talk"?

42
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,290
我只是说说
I'm just saying.

43
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,860
是的 你说的对 我是说
Yeah, you're right, I mean...

44
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,230
我们在同一个部门
We're in the same unit.

45
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,430
这事违反规定
It's against the rules.

46
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,970
不能这样了
It has to stop.

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,710
今晚是最后一次了 再也没有了
Tonight's the last time. Ever.

48
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,550
你真能装啊
You're so full of it.

49
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:50,350
杰西 我们不能告诉任何人
We can't tell anyone, Jesse.

50
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:53,360
莫兰德 丽贝卡
Moreland, Rebecca.

51
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,360
好的
Yeah.

52
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,020
说定了
Done.

53
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,290
我们说谎技术一流 对吧?
We're good liars, right?

54
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,670
我们要做的就是说谎
So all we have to do is lie.

55
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,650
本・垂德 二十一岁
Ben Trinder. Twenty-one years old.

56
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,280
法医做了毒理分析
Coroner did a tox screen.

57
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,220
GHB 又称液体迷魂药或G毒 是一种无色无味无臭的液体

58
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,220
GHB成阳性 注意了是 液体尼古丁
He was positive for GHB and get this: liquid nicotine.

59
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,120
真的假的?
Seriously?

60
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,260
这东西是致命的
That stuff's lethal.

61
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:29,860
GHB是一种派对毒品
GHB is a party drug.

62
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,990
技术含量低 小作坊就能做出来
It's low-tech, made in basement labs.

63
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,650
缉毒组认为毒贩子
Drug Squad's best guess is dealers

64
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:36,500
在里面加了尼古丁来提高兴奋度
 add in the nicotine to pump up the high.

65
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:39,500
那又怎么样 加多了 掺的多了点?
So what, they overshot, put in a little too much?

66
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:42,770
如果这批货有问题 那么麻烦就大了
If there's a bad batch of drugs out there, things can get real ugly.

67
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,880
奴佛卡因 一种麻醉剂

68
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,880
记得几年前有个毒贩子在可卡因里掺杂奴佛卡因
Remember a few years ago that dealer that was cutting coke with novocaine?

69
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:48,590
是的 死了八个 三十多个进了重症监护室
Yeah, eight people died and thirty more in I.C.U.

70
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:52,030
所以我们得快速行动 否则死的孩子越来越多
So we need to move fast, before we end up with more dead kids.

71
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,500
我们现在又什么线索?
So what we got?

72
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,310
没什么 一个地址 他死之前 
Not much, a location.

73
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,700
去了一个叫斯戴姆的地方
Before he died, he went to a place called Stem.

74
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,980
是个非法营业的俱乐部
It's an illegal after hours club.

75
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,060
- 从没听说过 - 我去过
 - Never heard of it.  - I've been there.

76
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,910
每隔几个月就换地方 避免被查
It moves around every few months to avoid getting busted.

77
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,180
口口相传 只招待获邀的客人
Word of mouth, invitation only.

78
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,780
这么说吧 约翰 基本上 如果你过了三十
See John, basically, if you're over thirty...

79
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:14,120
缉毒组不想进行突查 他们认为会打草惊蛇
Drug Squad doesn't want to do a raid, they think it will spook the dealer.

80
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,610
毒贩子会彻底消失 但是毒品却一直在市面上
He'll disappear into thin air, and the drugs stay out there.

81
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,450
所以他们把案子交给我们
So they're handing the case over to us.

82
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,010
斯戴姆的老板叫乔・凯恩
The owner of Stem is Joe Kane.

83
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:23,130
他因为袭击他人入狱两次
He's gone down twice for assault,

84
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,800
一次用破酒瓶子弄瞎一只眼
once with a broken bottle, took out someone's eye.

85
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,800
这家伙脾气很大
This guy's got a temper.

86
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:30,700
毫无疑问 他知道谁是毒贩子 是谁在卖毒品
 Guaranteed, he's going to know who the dealers are and who's selling.

87
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,580
缉毒组给我们送过来的 一张邀请卡
Drug Squad sent this over, it's an invitation card.

88
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,240
我们用它进俱乐部
We use it to get by the doorman.

89
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,180
杰西 你三十以下 交给你了
Jesse, you're under thirty, you can take point.

90
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,250
看看你能否进去弄清楚谁是毒贩子
See if you can get inside and get an idea on this dealer.

91
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:41,460
好的
 Cool.

92
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,130
要不我和他一起去?
Why don't I go with him?

93
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,570
我之前去过 我了解里面的情况
I've been there before, I know the scene.

94
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,970
你也想去做卧底?
You wanna go undercover?

95
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,640
他们成长的太快了
They grow up so fast.

96
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,640
嘿 我以前也参加过行动
Hey, I've done plays before.

97
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:56,540
都是小的 但是 是个好主意
Small ones. But, yeah, good idea,

98
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,140
让你去闯闯吧
Let's unleash you into the world.

99
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:07,790
俱乐部的入口在士巴丹拿街上的一个中餐馆里
The entrance to the club is in a Chinese restaurant on Spadina.

100
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:11,030
根据缉毒组的消息 你们穿过餐馆进入后厨
According to Drug Squad, you go through the restaurant into the kitchen.

101
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:15,560
后面有个楼梯 会带你到俱乐部
There's a stairway in back. It'll take you down to the club.

102
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:16,990
你们身上都有监听
You'll both be wired.

103
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:20,360
玛利亚和约翰掌控全局 他们就在楼上
Maria and John will run cover. They'll be right upstairs.

104
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,880
今晚是私人派对
Private party tonight.

105
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:34,010
不是吧?邀请卡不好用?
Seriously? This card doesn't work?

106
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,280
哥们 今晚不行
Not tonight, man.

107
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,480
向后转吧
Turn around.

108
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,550
这样呢? 这样行吗?
What about this? This help?

109
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,720
私人派对 哥们 对不起了
It's a private party, bro. Sorry.

110
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,620
怎么样才行呢?
What's it going to take?

111
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,090
不可能 好吗?
It's not happening, alright?

112
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,620
向后转吧 别浪费时间了
So turn around, stop wasting my time.

113
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,790
我想乔看到你
I don't think Joey

114
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:51,800
拒绝这么漂亮的女生一定不会开心的
 would be very happy with you turning away pretty girls.

115
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,630
你认识乔 是吗?
You know Joe do you?

116
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,100
我过去常来
I used to go to these parties all the time.

117
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,400
哦是吗?
Oh yeah?

118
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:03,910
那每次乔在那些顶级的DJ台上挂的是什么?
So what does Joe hang on top of the DJ booth at every location?

119
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:10,750
哥们 她当时太High了 没注意
Dude she was high, she wasn't paying attention.

120
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,750
不 不 不 我知道
No, no, no, I got this.

121
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,980
是个标记
It was a... sign.

122
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,650
是个卷轴之类的
It's one of those scrolling...

123
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:16,990
不要停止爱
"Don't Stop Love."

124
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,360
我说对了吗?
Am I right?

125
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:21,120
完全正确
I'm totally right.

126
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,860
进来两位
I got two coming down.

127
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,930

 Thank you so much.

128
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,730
宝贝 不要停止爱
 Don't stop the love, baby.

129
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,860
好了他们进去了
Okay they're in.

130
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,240
你真的认识那个家伙 乔 那个老板
Do you really know that guy, Joe the owner?

131
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,640
不认识 从来没见过
Nope. Never met him.

132
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:47,050
你们的工作就是找到毒贩子 就这么简单
Your job is to ID the dealer, that's it.

133
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,160
你们找到目标 和服务生 酒保 老板聊聊
You're looking to score. Talk to waiters, bartenders,

134
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,790
如果能见到老板的话
 the owner if you see him.

135
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,530
小心点 任何人发觉你们是警察
Be careful. Anyone smells you're a cop,

136
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:55,880
毒贩子就溜了
 the dealer will vanish.

137
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,960
给你们来点什么?
What can I get you?

138
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,800
啤酒 伏特加加苏打水
Beer and a vodka soda.

139
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,670
你后面
Behind you.

140
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,270
是乔吗?
Is that Joe?

141
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:09,670
我不知道  脸上没伤很难判断
I don't know. It's hard to tell without the bruises

142
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:12,970
我们走近看一下
Let's get a closer look.

143
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,380
知道吗 应该我一个人去
You know what, it should just be me.

144
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:18,510
不带你 我可以接近他
I can get closer to him without you.

145
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,950
稍等一下
Wait just a sec.

146
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:24,020
我会小心的
I'll be careful.

147
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,750
女朋友?
Girlfriend?

148
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:29,290
是的 不 有点复杂
Yeah. No, it's complicated.

149
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,760
你是个混蛋了
So you're a dick.

150
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,030
不是
No.

151
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,600
我想让她做我的女朋友 只是得让她知道
I want her to be my girlfriend, I just have to convince her.

152
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,490
好极了 我憎恨混蛋
Good, I hate dicks.

153
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:46,240
乔 嗨 
Joe, hi.

154
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:49,140
我喜欢这个新地方
I love the new building.

155
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,680
你不认得我了 是吧?
You don't recognize me, do you?

156
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,350
真的吗?
Seriously?

157
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,450
你就是这么一个人 哈?
You're one of those guys, huh?

158
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,650
卡丽
Khali.

159
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,250
哦 卡丽
Khali, right.

160
00:07:59,290 --> 00:07:59,950

一次都没有
Not even once.

174
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:34,220
真希望我能帮助你 但是我做不到
Wish I could help you out, I just can't do that.

你喜欢?

181
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,740
你开什么玩笑?
Are you kidding?

182

像那个虫子(指甲壳虫)
Like the bug.

196
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:57,130
这里一定有个家伙在出货 对吧?
There's gotta be a guy around here who's selling, right?

197
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:59,130
我想买点

200
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,170

201
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,010
你看起来挺失望的

202
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,880
杰西 谢谢请我喝酒
Thanks for the drink, Jesse.

203
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,090
- 我们走吧 - 好的
 - Let's go.  - Aliright.

204
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,330
怎么?
What's going on?

205
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,730
乔也确定今晚毒贩子不在
Joe's confirmed the dealer's not in the house.

206
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,900
卡丽要和那家伙去什么地方吗?
Is Khali going somewhere with that guy?

207
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,220
我觉得有点不对头
I've got a bad feeling about this.

208
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,720
他楼上有公寓 他要给她看些照片
He's got an apartment upstairs, he's going to show her some photos.

209
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,860
我要你跟着他们 好吗? 我也不喜欢这样
I want you to stay with them, okay? I don't like it either.

210
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,580
但是我们能监听到 
But we got ears.

211
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,830
我们让她继续 
We're going to let this one play.

212
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:41,900
别把她弄丢了
 Don't lose her.

213

我就在他们后面 他们要进后面了

这么做好吗?
Is this a good idea?

216
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,920
他们单独在一起她会获得更多的情报
She'll get more from him when they're alone,

217
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,200
如果运气好的话 毒贩子也许给他打个电话呢
then with a bit of luck, the dealer might make a house call.

218
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,110
你没事吧?
You okay?

219
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,000
我跟丢了 保镖不让我进去
I lost her. Bouncer won't let me through.

嗯 地方有点乱 但是
Well, it's kind of mess but...

222
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:15,980
请进 请进 别拘束

00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,890
三楼 六号

如果发生意外 你知道该怎么做
Anything bad happens, you know what to do.

231
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,500
我明白 你们快去吧
I got it, get up there, hurry.

232
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,390
我来让它从头播放 请便
Let me just pull this up. Be my guest.

233
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,860
哦哇 太令人惊讶了
Oh wow, these are amazing.

234
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:52,660
你是怎样抓拍到这些人的

235
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,720
我可是干这行的
That's what I do.

236
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,810
你在给我调什么饮料?
What are you pouring me?

237
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,510
大杯鸡尾酒
A big fat cocktail.

238
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,840
你想把我灌醉吗?
You trying to get me loaded or something?

239
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,450
那我就可以占你便宜了
Then I'm going to take advantage of you.

240
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,110
希望你能有这个运气
Good luck with that.

241
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:18,190
约翰 快点 情况有点不妙
John, hurry. I don't like what I'm hearing.

242
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,790
再加点这个...
A little of this...

243
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:22,930

伸出手来
Hold out your hand.

251

She's holding her own, but you gotta move.

262
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:25,290
你之前喝过GHB吗?

00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,880
他强迫我喝GHB
He was trying to get me to take GHB.

292
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,870
然后他把我推到墙角 我无处可逃
Then he slams me up against the wall. It came out of nowhere.

293
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,960

你看起来并不好 你的嘴唇破了
You're not fine. Your lips.

295
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:01,180

Look, this was a tough situation,

302
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:17,460
你已经做的很好了
 you did good.

303
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:18,560
走吧
Come on.

304
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,540
怎么了?
What's going on?

305
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,410
刚收到的
This just came in.

306
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,240
泰勒・克拉克
Tyler Clarke.

307
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:40,020
二十岁 GHB里混有液态尼古丁
Twenty years old. GHB laced with liquid nicotine.

308
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:42,180
我们手里又多了一个服药过量的案子
We got another overdose on our hands.

309
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:54,140
我以为他要杀你
I thought he was going to kill you.

310
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,150
你和他在一起的时候 
You were in there with him,

311
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,230
我却无法到你身边保护你
and I couldn't get to you.

312
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,170
嘿 我没事 没关系的 
Hey. I'm okay. It's okay.

313
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,400
不 有关系! 刚才很危险
No it's not okay! That was brutal.

314
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,270
你差点在丽贝卡面前暴露我们的关系
You nearly blew our cover with Rebecca,

315
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:02,930
你知道吗?
 you know.

316
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:05,310
我不在乎
I don't care.

317
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,520
你真的很难过
You're really upset.

318
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:10,690
你现在才看出来吗?
You just figured that out now?

319
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,700
我把血渍沾你嘴上了
I'm getting blood on you.

320
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:29,040
走吧 我来开车
C'mon on, I'll drive.

321
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,680
这是圈套 我是被陷害的
This is entrapment. I was set up.

322
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,650
是吗? 那事实怎样?
Yeah? How's that?

323
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,180
那些毒品不是我的 是她的
Those weren't my drugs, they were hers.

324
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,700
肯定是她把毒品带到我屋里去的
She must've brought them up to my place,

325
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,090
这是常有的事
happens all the time.

326
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:46,180
我没有碰她 
I didn't touch her,

327
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,310
是她先袭击我的
 she attacked me,

328
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,600
我是在正当防卫
 I was defending myself.

329
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,830
- 乔. - 信她还是信我
- Joe. - It's her word against mine.

330
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:53,130
谁知道呢 或许你足够走运
Who knows, maybe you'll get lucky.

331
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,260
法官会相信你说的话
Maybe the judge'll believe you.

332
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:58,530
但现在 我才不关心呢
At this moment, I couldn't care less.

333
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:00,630
本・垂德, 泰勒・克拉克.
Ben Trinder, Taylor Clarke.

334
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:03,370
这两个男孩都在你的俱乐部里买了毒品
Both of these kids bought drugs at your club.

335
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,240
GHB 你应该知道的比我多 
GHB, you know all about it.

336
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,680
我们在你厨房里找到了一打
We found a dozen caps in your kitchen.

337
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,860
就是这些毒品杀害了他们 他们才刚刚二十岁
It killed them. These kids were barely twenty.

338
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,140
或许他们是从别处买的
Maybe they got them somewhere else,

339
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,900
肯定是的 因为我的俱乐部里不卖毒品
All right, cause I don't allow drugs in my club.

340
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:15,840
这是违法的
 That would be illegal...

341
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,010
我现在没有心情和你玩...
I'm not in the mood to play games...

342
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:18,930
我才不在乎你有没有心情呢 女士!
I don't care what the hell you're in the mood for, lady!

343
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:21,040
你把我带到这里 想栽赃给我
You drag me down here, you throw all this crap at me.

344
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,660
如果这些毒品被人买走...
If anymore of these drugs get sold...

345
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:24,660
那不关我的事!
That's not my problem!

346
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:26,560
我没有做错任何事!
I have done nothing wrong!

347
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:29,100
现在我可以打个电话吗?
Now can I please make my phone call?

348
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,680
我们没法控告乔・凯恩 但是我们暂时
We got nothing from Joe Kane, but we're holding him,

349
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,690
以伤害罪和非法经营酒吧罪扣留他
for assault and running an illegal bar.

350
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,690
又一起服药过量案件和俱乐部有关 死因相同
A second OD has been linked back to the club. Same cause of death.

351
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,080
我应该提醒你们 上面给了我很大的压力
I should warn you. I'm getting big pressure from the brass.

352
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,390
他们想关停俱乐部
They want to shut the club down.

353
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:45,000
这不是个好主意 他们会换个地方的
That's a bad idea, it'll just pop up somewhere else.

354
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,010
他们要求我们在二十四小时内破案
They're giving us 24 hours to get this done.

355
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,710
什么? 你在开玩笑吗?
What? You're kidding me.

356
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:51,830
你想给我们展示那晚你的成果吗?
You wanna show us the spoils of your evening?

357
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:55,770
我从乔的笔记本上拷了一千张照片
I grabbed over a 1,000 photos from Joe's laptop.

358
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:58,910
这是其中十五张 拍自十五个不同的晚上
So far, fifteen of them, from fifteen different nights.

359
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:01,510
这个家伙 总是出现
This guy, he's in the background.

360
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:04,950
站在一个特定的地方 然后有人去找他
Standing in one spot and people coming up to him.

361
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:05,950
看起来像在做交易 
That looks like a buy

362
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,340
我要是能看到他们的手就好了
if I could see their hands.

363
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:10,350
我们需要知道他是谁 从乔那里
We need a name, that's going to come from our friend Joe.

364
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,390
还有调酒师碧豆
The bartender, Beetle.

365
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,520
你找到突破点了?
You got an angle?

366
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,190
她喜欢英俊的小伙子
She likes nice guys.

367
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,330
我想我可以去扮伤心要同情
I'm thinking I could be a little heart broken.

368
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,030
这是目前最好的办法了
That's our best move.

369
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:22,330
好的 那我马上回俱乐部
Okay, so I'll head back into the club.

370
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,430
不用了 今晚你退出行动
Not you. You got the night off.

371
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,910
我们也应该在街上增派人员 
We should also be working the street.

372
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:27,570
联系你们的线人也许他们有线索
Check with your CI's maybe they've heard something.

373
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,100
我们必须马上抓到这个毒贩子
We need to get this dealer now.

374
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,840
卡丽 有时间吗?
Khali, got a second?

375
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,120
能把门关上吗?
Can you shut the door?

376
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,220
你脸怎么样?
How's your face?

377
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,390
有点疼
It's hurting.

378
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:53,260
假如
Hypothetical.

379
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,760
我的两个探员私下里交往过密
If two of my officers were becoming personally involved,

380
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,870
对我来说可能是个麻烦
it would be a problem for me.

381
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,400
我不得不按程序处理
I'd have to follow procedure.

382
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,940
把其中一个从这里调出去
Transfer one of them out of the unit.

383
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:05,510
如果这真的发生的话
If they were.

384
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,510
是的
Yeah.

385
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,110
一旦牵扯到感情 你不能清晰的思考
That kind of emotion, you can't think clearly.

386
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,650
卡丽 这不是游戏 孩子们正在被杀害
This isn't a game Khali, kids are dying.

387
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,810
你做出错误的选择 或一旦分心
You make bad choices, you get distracted.

388
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:16,150
大家的性命都会有危险
You put everyone's life in danger.

389
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,150
我不想看到这样的事情发生
I wouldn't want that to happen.

390
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,750
我也是
Me either.

391
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,690
我还需要和其他人进行这样的谈话吗?
Do I need to have this talk with anyone else?

392
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:25,330
不 你说得很对
No, you're good.

393
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,540
我做过很多疯狂又愚蠢的事去引起她的注意
I've done some crazy-ass things to impress her.

394
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:38,400
昨晚和你在一起的那个女孩吗?
This is the girl from last night?

395
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,170
记得有一次在高中...
This one time in high school...

396
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:44,110
这真的有点难以启齿
this is kinda embarrassing.

397
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,610
你做了很愚蠢的事情
You did something stupid.

398
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:48,470
我想向她展示我多么敏捷就从窗台跳了下去
I wanted to show her how agile I was so I jumped out of a window

399
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:49,520
结果摔断了腿
and I broke my leg.

400
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,480
但这奏效了 非常成功
But it worked, big time.

401
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,880
所以你对她真的很好 哈
So you're sweet, huh.

402
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,790
你就是这么和她上床的 凡事都顺着她?
That's how you get laid, by being a sweetheart?

403
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,890
或许我应该尝试硬气一些 
Should try being hardcore,

404
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:00,130
看看女孩子是否更喜欢那样?
 see if girls like that better?

405
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,090
不 不 继续对她好 体贴人是件好事
No, no, stick with sweet, sweet is good.

406
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:06,400
她今晚在哪呢 你的灵魂伴侣?
So where is she tonight, your soulmate?

407
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:09,570
不知道 或许她背着我出去和别的男人鬼混了
I don't know, she's probably out cheating on me.

408
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,700
你笑什么 很好笑吗?
What, that's funny?

409
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,470
她也许正和吉他手滚床单呢
She's banging some guitar player.

410
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,670
他给她写了首歌
This guy wrote a song for her.

411
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:18,140
我还能怎么做?
How am I suppose to compete with that?

412
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,510
那就做点比这还甜蜜的事
You got out-sweeted.

413
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:22,810
今晚我要让自己玩到疯
The way this night is going, I need to get high.

414
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:25,520
喝个酩酊大醉
I need to get completely messed up.

415
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:34,390
我本不该这样做的
I should not be doing this.

416
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,330
跟他提我
Mention my name,

417
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,430
他会帮你拿货的 好吧
and he will hook you up, okay.

418
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,870
我走了 你对我真好
Off I go. You're the best.

419
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,530
记住 小心点
Watch yourself, okay?

420
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:45,940
利亚姆这人有点疯狂
Liam's a little crazy.

421
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:48,240
在他那凡事都小心点
No sudden moves around him.

422
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:56,460
来人啊! 这需要帮助!
Help! We need help in here!

423
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,480
这个家伙没有呼吸了!
This guy isn't breathing!

424
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,550
我不知道 他刚刚在我面前昏倒了
I don't know. He just keeled over, right in front of me.

425
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:05,890
你能讲话吗?
Can you talk?

426
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,360
叫救护车了吗?
Did you call an ambulance?

427
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:10,690
叫了 我再打一次 问他们多久能到
Yeah, I'll call back and see how far they are.

428
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,030
马克!
Mark!

429
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,430
他怎么了!?
What happened to him!?

430
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,630
你认识他?
You know this guy?

431
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:19,140
他喝了什么? 谁给他的?
What did he take? Who gave it to him?

432
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:21,870
我不知道 我看到他时他就躺在地上了
I don't know, he was lying on the ground.

433
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:23,350
马克 快醒醒! 噢 天哪 
Mark, wake up! Oh God,

434
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,240
他究竟喝了什么?
 what did he take?

435
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:26,710
我需要帮忙 突发事件 在男洗手间 现在!
I need help, emergency, in the men's washroom, now!

436
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,240
这个男孩叫马克・卡梅伦
His name is Mark Cameron.

437
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,050
在送达西奈医院时死亡
He was DOA at Mount Sinai.

438
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:30,730
第三起服药过量死亡案件
Three OD's.

439
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:31,650
三个不同的夜晚 
Three different nights.

440
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:32,840
都是从一个俱乐部里出来的
All from the same club.

441
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,670
保镖似乎没想过出这样的事
The bouncer seemed to really take it hard.

442
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:37,290
看看这个 这是马克的手机
Take a look at this, it's Mark's phone.

443
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,720
那是另外两个受害者
That's the other two victims.

444
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,720
也就是说他们三个都互相认识
So they knew each other, all three of them?

445
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,840
他们都是朋友
They were all friends?

446
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,140
他们一起狂欢 从同一个毒贩那买货
They partied together, had the same dealer?

447
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,090
估计是利亚姆
 Presumably Liam.

448
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:47,290
好吧 但等等
Okay, but wait.

449
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:50,600
他死的那晚马克收到了一条短信
The night he died, Mark got a text.

450
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:53,000
"嘿宝贝 你今晚真应该到斯戴姆来
"Hey, baby, you should come to Stem tonight,

451
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,070
我在狂欢 等不及要见你了"
 I'm partying, dying to meet you."

452
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,780
来自一次性手机 不可能追踪得到
Came from a burner cell, it's impossible to trace.

453
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:01,040
再看看本的手机 两天之前
And check out Ben's phone, two nights earlier.

454
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,340
完全相同的短信
Same text word for word.

455
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,310
他们是被引诱到那个俱乐部的
They were lured to the club.

456
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:08,220
有人盯上了这几个孩子 一个接着一个
Someone is targeting these boys, one by one.

457
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,350
我们面对的是多起谋杀
We're dealing with multiple murders.

458
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:24,400
好了 丹尼 我们要找到利亚姆 
OK, Danny, we need to find Liam

459
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,420
然后做成一次交易
 and make a buy.

460
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,200
我们需要把他逮捕进来问话
We need to bring him in for questioning.

461
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,680
没问题 我现在在三楼
You got it. I'm on the third floor now.

462
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,300
把你看到的告诉我
Tell me what you see.

463
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:33,020
看起来是一个血汗工厂 
Looks like a sweatshop,

464
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:33,930
一定是在后面
must be at the back.

465
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:36,170
注意安全 碧豆说他是个疯子
Be careful, Beetle said he's crazy.

466
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,070
那么这应该会很有趣咯
So this should be fun then?

467
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:42,180
嘿 我要找利亚姆
Hey, I'm looking for Liam.

468
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:45,610
缉毒警察在找那些男孩的家人了解情况
Drug Squad's following up with the families of the boys.

469
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:47,650
或许他们了解一些事情
Maybe they know something.

470
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,420
本・垂德有案底
Ben Trinder has a sheet.

471
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,650
意图贩毒 两次被抓
Possession for the purpose, two counts.

472
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:54,420
也就是说 这些家伙在做贩毒生意
So what, these guys are in the drug business?

473
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,190
在利亚姆的地盘上
Honing in on Liam's turf

474
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:59,460
他不喜欢竞争对手 于是决定除掉他们
and he didn't like the competition, and decided to take them out?

475
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:01,890
有可能 或许是个动机
It's possible. Could be a motive.

476
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,600
嘿 我是丹尼尔 我就是打电话的那个
Hey, I'm Daniel. I'm the one that called.

477
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,210
郊区来的丹尼尔 你好吗
Daniel from the suburbs, how you doing?

478
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,410
我不玩了
I'm out.

479
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,780
来这边 我们在这里聊聊
Come over here, let's talk over here.

480
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:21,580
听着...
Listen...

481
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:23,820
我听说你或许可以帮帮我
I heard you could help me out, maybe.

482
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:24,950
你听说的 是吗
You heard that, huh?

483
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:27,420
我不会让你浪费时间的 哥们
I could make it worth your while, man.

484
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:29,920
你现在有的我全要了
I'll take everything you got right now.

485
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:33,090
你是想聊聊 还是我可以走人了
You want to talk about it or should I turn around?

486
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:34,760
你是乔的一个朋友
You're a friend of Joe's?

487
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:35,490
对
Yeah.

488
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:38,900
我喜欢乔 他是个正直的家伙
I like Joe. He's a stand-up guy.

489
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:40,830
是吗 我听说他是个混蛋
Really? I think he's a dick.

490
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:45,170
这家伙是个喜剧演员
This guy's a comedian.

491
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,980
我能给你看样东西吗
Can I show you something?

492
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:53,240
瞧瞧这个 我刚刚拿到手的
Look at this, I just got this,

493
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,780
好像有四百年历史了
it's like four hundred years old.

494
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,920
你是个警察吗 丹尼尔
Are you a cop, Daniel?

495
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,490
因为如果你是的话 
'Cause if you are,

496
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:08,060
我会用我的古董刀把你开肠破肚的
I'm going to gut you with my antique knife.

497
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:11,530
插进去就像切黄油一样 它就是这么锋利
Goes in like butter, that's how sharp it is.

498
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,330
我知道的
I know.

499
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:14,680
我已经试过了 
I already tried it,

500
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,500
在上一个想成为我朋友的警察身上
on the last cop who wanted to be my friend.

501
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,600
放松点 好吗
Let's relax, alright?

502
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,810
如果我是一个警察 你早就被逮捕了
If I was a cop, you'd be in cuffs right now.

503
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,610
你害怕了
You're scared.

504
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,540
哦天啊 你害怕了
Oh boy, you're scared.

505
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:30,480
你在干什么 兄弟
What are you doing, man?

506
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,780
你要在我的衬衫上弄出一个洞吗
Are you putting a hole in my shirt?

507
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,950
你知道这件衬衫多贵吗
You know how much this shirt cost?

508
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:37,220
哦天呐 我把它弄坏了
Oh man, I wrecked it.

509
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:43,160
听着 乔说你的货很好 我要买一批
Look, Joe said you had good stuff, and I'm buying in bulk.

510
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,950
如果你觉得我是一个警察 
So if you think I'm a cop,

511
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,560
我还是去找别人买货好了
then I'll go buy my stuff somewhere else.

512
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:50,030
找一个不那么疑神疑鬼的人
From someone less paranoid, maybe.

513
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,870
你说的"一批"
What's that mean:

514
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,010
是什么意思
"bulk".

515
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:01,110
两升起步
Two liters to start?

516
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:05,350
好了 卡丽 你发现了什么
OK, Khali, what have you got?

517
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,320
实验室报告
Lab reports.

518
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:10,150
血液和马克・卡梅伦的匹配
The blood work from Mark Cameron is a match.

519
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:12,590
这三个男孩的死因相同
All three boys died of the same thing.

520
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,990
同种的GHB
Same bunch of GHB.

521
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:18,200
和疯子利亚姆卖给丹尼尔的完全相同
It's identical and matches what Crazy Liam sold to Daniel.

522
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,230
除了一样东西
Except for one thing.

523
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,120
尼古丁
The nicotine.

524
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,700
对 丹尼尔买到的没有被掺东西 它是纯净的
Yeah. What Daniel bought wasn't laced, it was clean.

525
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:25,230
所以利亚姆只给几个胶囊掺了东西
So Liam was lacing the individual caps.

526
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:28,490
有目标的杀戮 他想除掉竞争对手
Targeted killings. He wanted to take out his competition.

527
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,840
我们应该和保镖谈谈 奥兰多
We should talk to the bouncer, Orlando.

528
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:32,340
当马克躺在地上的时候 他的反应
When Mark was on the floor there, his reaction?

529
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:33,840
我觉得他认识他们
I think he knows them.

530
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,960
如果这些男孩想接管利亚姆的生意 
Makes sense if these boys want to

531
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,610
这也说得通
take over Liam's business.

532
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:38,480
奥兰多在那里工作 他或许有牵连
Orlando worked there, he could be involved.

533
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:40,700
我要去拜访他一下 
I'm going to go pay him a visit.

534
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,620
看看他能不能帮我解答些问题
See if he can fill in some blanks.

535
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:45,950
你想不想去利亚姆那里
You wanna have a go at Liam there?

536
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:47,060
好的
Yeah.

537
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,630
不
No.

538
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:57,900
我不想见你 我想要那个坑了我的警察
I don't want you, I want the cop that tricked me.

539
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:00,560
你为何不出去把他叫进来
Why don't you go out there and get him and bring him back

540
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,220
因为我有些事情要给他说
cause I got a couple of things I want to say to him.

541
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,840
你说够了吗
You finished?

542
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:06,210
因为我有些坏消息 利亚姆
'Cause I got some bad news for you, Liam.

543
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,310
贩毒已经足够糟了 再加上杀人
Trafficking was bad enough, but now manslaughter.

544
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,640
你完蛋了
You're screwed.

545
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,650
你在说些什么
What the hell are you talking about?

546
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,350
那些你在斯戴姆卖的GHB胶囊
Those GHB caps you're selling at the Stem,

547
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,480
你给它们下了毒
you've been cutting them with poison.

548
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,090
液态尼古丁
Liquid nicotine.

549
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,220
我没有
No, I'm not.

550
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,150
你有的
Oh yes, you are.

551
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:23,220
三个死掉的孩子 利亚姆 那可不妙啊
Three dead kids, Liam, that's not good.

552
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:26,330
喂 别说了
Whoa, whoa, just stop!

553
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,860
你好好想一想
Just think about it for a second.

554
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,380
首先 我是一个艺术家 好吗
A, I'm an artist, alright,

555
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,300
我对我的作品很骄傲
 I take pride in my work.

556
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:37,670
其次 我怎么会杀掉我的客户呢
B, I'd be killing off my own clientele.

557
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,410
开玩笑吧 你觉得我会想让自己失业
What? You think I'm trying to put myself out of business?

558
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,670
我不知道 或许你想让别人失业
I don't know, maybe you're trying to put them out of business.

559
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:44,130
你在说些什么
What are you talking about?

560
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,950
那些孩子是不是闯进你的地盘了 利亚姆
Were those kids stepping on your turf, Liam?

561
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:50,950
听着 这件事可能是我任何一个客户干的
Look. Any one of my customers could have done it.

562
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:53,420
好好算算吧 那个俱乐部里有数百个孩子
Do the math, hundreds of kids in that club.

563
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:56,490
利亚姆那么你告诉我 是谁干的?
Then you tell me, which one did it Liam?

564
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:57,980
给我找律师 就现在 
My lawyer, right now,

565
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,620
在此之前我一句话都不会说
 before I say another word.

566
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:07,730
给这个家伙找个律师
Let's get this kid a lawyer.

567
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:09,770
他会需要的
He's going to need one.

568
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:17,780
早上好 奥兰多
Good morning, Orlando.

569
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:19,710
警探 丽贝卡・爱丽丝
Rebecca Ellis, Detective Sergeant.

570
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,780
我有几个问题要问你
I have a couple of questions for you.

571
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:22,850
关于什么的
About what?

572
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,150
你的朋友 马克
Your friend, Mark.

573
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:27,220
他在医院去世了 我很抱歉
He died at the hospital. I'm sorry.

574
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,460
好的... 请进
Yeah... come in.

575
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,830
你现在住在乔的家里了
So you're crashing at Joe's place?

576
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:48,470
对 他被逮捕了 我帮他照看一下家
Yeah, he got arrested. I'm looking after it for him.

577
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:50,270
你怎么知道我在这里
How'd you know I was here?

578
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:52,980
就是我逮捕的他
I'm the one who arrested him.

579
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:56,170
你是否也认识这两个孩子
Did you know these two boys as well?

580
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:58,300
泰勒・克拉克还有本・垂德
Tyler Clarke and Ben Trinder.

581
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,820
不
No.

582
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:05,110
我是说 他们是来过俱乐部 他们服药过量了
I mean, yeah they came to the club. They OD'd.

583
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:07,120
我就知道这些
That's all I know.

584
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:11,860
谁给的他们GHB
Who gave them the GHB?

585
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,020
谁想让他们死 奥兰多 
Who wants them dead Orlando?

586
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:16,530
或许他们在贩毒 惹毛了某人
They were dealing drugs maybe? Pissed someone off?

587
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,590
得了吧 你在俱乐部工作
C'mon you work at the club,

588
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:20,440
你能注意到很多事情
 you see things.

589
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:23,040
我说了...
Like I said...

590
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:27,280
他们来俱乐部 他们喜欢在俱乐部闲逛
They come to the club, they like to hang out at the club.

591
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:29,610
我们很友好 仅此而已
We're friendly, that's it.

592
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:32,910
还有吗
And what else?

593
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:34,050
没了
Nothing.

594
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:42,960
奥兰多 你一定知道点什么
Orlando, you know something about this.

595
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:45,460
告诉我发生了什么
Tell me what happened.

596
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:51,330
你告诉我会感觉好些的
You'll feel better when you do.

597
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:55,140
我不会的 相信我
No I won't, believe me.

598
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,970
我没办法不想这件事情
I can't stop thinking about it.

599
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:00,810
你看到了什么
What did you see?

600
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:07,280
不好的事情
Something bad.

601
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,320
非常非常不好的事情
Something very, very bad.

602
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:15,520
在俱乐部里的后面 有一个储藏室
There's this stock room, in the club, in the back.

603
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,800
那里有一个女孩
And there's a girl.

604
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,670
哥们 你来不来
Bro, you in or out?

605
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,770
那是本 那个死掉的家伙 那个服药过量的
It was Ben, the guy that died, that OD'd.

606
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,970
本・垂德
Ben Trinder?

607
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:34,640
对 马克也在那里
Yeah. And Mark was there too.

608
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:39,010
他们在脱她的衣服
They were taking off her clothes.

609
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:42,450
她是谁
Who is she?

610
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,920
我不知道 某个女孩 叫做萨蒂
I don't know, man, some girl, named Sadie.

611
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,290
你到底来不来
So you in or out?

612
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,190
然后我什么也没做
And I did nothing.

613
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:53,290
我去了酒吧
I went to the bar.

614
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:57,530
喝了几杯 磕了药
I got shots, I got wasted.

615
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:03,440
我看到那个女孩出来了 萨蒂
I saw the girl come out, Sadie.

616
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:07,010
她看起来很糟 她在哭
She looked bad, she was crying.

617
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,580
我不知道她是谁 
I don't know who she was,

618
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:11,080
我以前从来没在酒吧看到过她
I never saw her at the bar before.

619
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:13,470
我本应该做些什么 我本应该 
I should've done something, I should have.

620
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:14,810
我为什么没有报警
 I should have... why didn't I call the cops?

621
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:18,680
我为什么没进去亲自阻止他们
Why didn't I go in there, myself?

622
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:25,220
那个房间里有多少人和萨蒂在一起
How many guys were in the room with Sadie?

623
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,560
五个... 五个
Five... five.

624
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,690
马克 泰勒 本 还有另外两个
Mark, Tyler, Ben, and two more.

625
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:31,300
我不认识他们
I don't know them.

626
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,770
奥兰多 有人盯上了这些男孩
Orlando, someone's targeting these boys.

627
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,300
如果还有那两个人...
If there's two out there...

628
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:37,370
我很抱歉 我不知道他们的名字
I'm sorry, I don't know their names.

629
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:41,040
听着 我说的是实话
Look, I'm telling you the truth.

630
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,710
萨蒂什么
Sadie what?

631
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:46,810
没有姓
No last name.

632
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:50,250
找出上个月的性侵犯列表
Just pull up sexual assaults in the last month.

633
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:54,150
没有结果 她可能没有报案
Nothing. She probably didn't report it.

634
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:57,290
做一个一般检索 女孩 十六到二十四岁
Do a general search. Girls, 16 to 24,

635
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:59,190
名字开头字母是"S"
 first name starts with "S"...

636
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:02,930
好吧 看来有五百个结果
Okay. There's like five hundred.

637
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,430
什么
What?

638
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,130
萨蒂・杰森
Sadie Jansen.

639
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:11,470
哦 天呐 她两周前自杀了
Oh God, she committed suicide two weeks ago.

640
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,100
上吊自杀
Hanged herself.

641
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,340
谁报的警 上面写了吗
Who called it in? Does it say?

642
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:18,940
她的父母出城了 发现她的是...
Her parents were out of town, she was found by...

643
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,450
什么
What?

644
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,610
她的姐姐 布林内・杰森
Her sister. Brynne Jansen.

645
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:29,950
昵称 碧豆
Nickname, Beetle.

646
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,950
她把强奸她妹妹的男孩作为目标
She's targeting the boys who raped her sister.

647
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,110
所以她买了药 加上尼古丁
So she buys the drugs, adds the nicotine,

648
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:45,340
把他们勾引到俱乐部里 在他们的饮料里投毒
lures them into the club, spikes their drinks.

649
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,120
让那看起来像是服药过量
Makes it look like an OD.

650
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,740
所以这是十足的复仇 
So it's revenge, pure and simple.

651
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,410
她还有两个目标
And she has two more targets out there.

652
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:52,190
她可能在任何时候毒死他们
She could poison them any minute.

653
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:53,870
- 我们知道名字了吗 - 暂时还不知道
- We got names? - We're not there yet.

654
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:54,780
为什么我们不能带她过来
Why don't we just pick her up?

655
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:55,560
你有没有和凶杀组交流
 Have you talked to Homicide?

656
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,300
她不在家 也不接电话
She's not at home, she's not answering her phone.

657
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:00,500
而且我们目前还没有足够的证据
Besides, we don't have enough evidence, not yet.

658
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:02,480
杰西你今晚还去俱乐部 你和卡丽两个
Jesse you're going to the club tonight, you and Khali.

659
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:06,370
我们需要供词 可以吗? 好了 我们行动吧
We need to get a confession. Okay? All right, let's get this done.

660
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:13,340
今晚需要所有人都参加行动 
It's going to be all hands on deck tonight,

661
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:16,080
包括卡丽 都仔细听
including Khali, everyone has ears.

662
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,740
杰西是主角
Jesse will take point.

663
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:21,800
约翰和丹尼尔在楼上的餐厅做后援
John and Daniel will be upstairs in the restaurant for back up.

664
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,540
玛利亚和我在车里
Maria and I will be in the van.

665
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,800
我们一切就绪 有声音了
 We're good, we got audio.

666
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,470
她不在吧台
She's not at the bar.

667
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,130
你能在这稍等我一下吗?
You wanna hang back for a second?

668
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:43,350
我找碧豆
I'm looking for Beetle.

669
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,530
我也在找
You and me both.

670
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:46,470
她今晚不上班?
She's not working tonight?

671
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:49,440
找到她 告诉她快过来 我需要帮手
When you find her, tell her to get back here, I need help.

672
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,220
她在这里
She's here somewhere.

673
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,790
她不见了
She's gone AWOL.

674
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:57,520
好吧 我们四周看看
Okay, let's take a look around.

675
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,220
卡丽 你需要检查整个俱乐部
 Khali, you need to search the entire club.

676
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:04,290
奥兰多说过一个储藏室 看看你能不能找到
Orlando mentioned a stock room, see if you can find it.

677
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,400
没看到她 我们分开行动 
No sign of her yet, we're going to split up.

678
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,780
我找到她了
I found her.

679
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:35,420
碧豆在储藏室
Beetle's in the stock room.

680
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,610
她在干嘛?
What's she doing?

681
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:38,600
坐在那 地板上
Sitting there, on the ground.

682
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,410
看起来很紧张
She's looking pretty rattled.

683
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:42,020
我一直在想
I just keep thinking.

684
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:45,590
如果我关心的人被伤害 如果我能想象的出
If somebody I care about got hurt, if I could picture that.

685
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:46,980
我是什么感觉
How I'd feel.

686
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:50,230
好的 杰西 好好利用 尽量拿到一份证词
That's good, Jesse, use it, try and get a confession.

687
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:52,040
你有五分钟时间 如果没结果 
You've got five minutes, if it doesn't work,

688
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,730
我们就靠目前手上的证据逮捕她
 we arrest her on the evidence we have.

689
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:57,280
证据不是充分 所以你要尽力
Which isn't much, so give me your best shot.

690
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,050
我就在外面
I'll be right outside.

691
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:13,700
哦 对不起 我不知道你在这
Oh sorry, I didn't know you were in here.

692
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:15,300
你在干吗呢?
What are you doing?

693
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,940
我刚碰到我的前女友 那天晚上跟你说的那个
I just ran into my ex again. From that night, I told you?

694
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,930
她又和那个家伙在一起了
She was with that guy, again.

695
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:24,910
那个吉他手
The guitar player.

696
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:28,110
对不起 我就是需要点时间
Sorry, I just... I need a second.

697
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:30,270
你不能待在这 快走吧
You can't stay here, you should go.

698
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:35,390
我需要喝一杯 你要来一杯吗?
I just need a drink. You wanna do a shot?

699
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:43,720
说实话 看样子你也需要喝一杯
To tell you the truth, you look like you could use one.

700
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:47,130
对不起 我不该管闲事
Sorry, it's not my business.

701
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:55,740
和卡丽的那个家伙 不是好东西
That guy with Khali, he's bad news.

702
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:57,950
我看的出来
I can tell.

703
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:00,440
我脑子里一直在想
I keep getting these pictures in my head.

704
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:04,080
如果他伤了她
If he ever hurt her...

705
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:06,790
我会疯掉的
I'd go crazy.

706
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:10,570
你会发疯的
You'd get mad.

707
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:12,000
还用说吗
Hell yeah.

708
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,660
能有多疯狂?
How mad?

709
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:25,100
说实话吗? 如果他真伤了她?
Honestly? If he hurt her bad?

710
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:27,800
以我对她的感情
The way I feel about her.

711
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,000
我真看不出我还能保持冷静
I don't see how I wouldn't lose control.

712
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:34,910
那时你已经无法思考
You wouldn't be able to think,

713
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:37,380
甚至连呼吸都不行
or breathe.

714
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,810
没错
Exactly.

715
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:43,020
你完全被怒火控制
It would take you over.

716
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:47,020
看起来你有过相似的经历啊
Sounds like you've been there before.

717
00:35:56,100 --> 00:36:00,470
是的 你怎么这么说?
Yeah. What makes you say that?

718
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,030
因为我以前也经历过
Because I've been there before.

719
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:09,760
真的 我做过一些坏事
It's true. I've done some bad things.

720
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:21,280
碧豆 发生了什么事? 你也做过吗?
What happened, Beetle? Did you do something?

721
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:29,130
我妹妹
My little sister.

722
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:37,200
一群禽兽把她灌醉了 给她嗑药 然后
A bunch of guys got her drunk and high and...

723
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:40,950
他们伤害了她
they hurt her.

724
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:43,870
是吗? 有多糟?
Yeah? How bad?

725
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:50,150
他们强奸了她
They raped her.

726
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:52,750
就在这 在这个屋子里
Right here, right in this room.

727
00:36:55,390 --> 00:37:00,560
我每天醒来都在想
And I wake up every day thinking,

728
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:04,360
我要让这些家伙都死光
all I want is for those guys to be dead.

729
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:07,030
好了开始了
Alright here we go.

730
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:09,670
但是你个子不高
 But you're not that big, though.

731
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,670
也没有必要
You don't have to be.

732
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,370
你怎么做的?
How would you do it?

733
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:25,310
毒药的妙处在于 他们都不知道自己是怎么了
The thing about poison is, they don't know what's happening to them.

734
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:31,390
你不用告诉他们你为什么要杀他们
You don't get to tell them why you're killing them.

735
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:35,520
但是这最后的一个家伙
But this last guy,

736
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,060
我告诉他了
I told him.

737
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:41,900
我说你强奸了莎蒂
I said "You raped Sadie"

738
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:45,630
他哭着求我
And he begged and cried.

739
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:46,600
是谁?
Who did?

740
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:52,340
谁哭着求你?
Who begged and cried?

741
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,410
你做了什么?
Did you do something?

742
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,740
他在哪?
Where is he?

743
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,850
我本不应该告诉你的
I shouldn't have told you.

744
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,580
碧豆 他在哪?
Beetle, where is he?

745
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:09,160
他在那吗?
Is he in there?

746
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,930
别过来 别过来
Stay back, stay back!

747
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,030
把枪放下 别激动
Put it down. Take it easy.

748
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:21,330
约翰 快进去 她手里有枪
John, get in there. There's weapon in play.

749
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:24,210
哦天啊
Oh, God.

750
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:25,540
卡丽 原地待命
 Khali, stay where you are.

751
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:27,670
我会开枪的 我要让他死
I will shoot you. I want him dead.

752
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:28,740
放下枪
Put it down.

753
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:30,680
他必须死在那
He stays in there until he's dead!

754
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:33,110
退回去 待在原地别动
 Get back, stay right where you are!

755
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,950
卡丽 卡丽
 Khali! Khali!

756
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,110
碧豆
Beetle.

757
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,260
碧豆 你不认识我
Beetle, You don't know me.

758
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:51,090
碧豆 我是警察
I'm a cop, Beetle.

759
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:53,260
杰西也是 我们是卧底警察
So is Jesse. We're undercover cops.

760
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:56,410
卡丽 离开这 快点 出去
 Khali, out of here, go, get out.

761
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,210
外面还有警察吗?
Are there more cops outside?

762
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,780
外面还有警察吗?
Are there more cops outside?!

763
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:02,310
是的 是的外面有
Yes, yes there are.

764
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,280
碧豆 求你把枪放下
Beetle, please just put down the gun.

765
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:06,100
如果他们进来 我就杀了他
If they come in here, I will shoot him.

766
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,260
我才不管别的 我要杀了他 你告诉他们
I don't care, I will kill him. You tell them that.

767
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,040
- 好的 好的 - 我不在乎
- Okay, okay. - I don't care.

768
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,620
好的 我会告诉他们
OK, I'll let them know.

769
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,320
听我说
Listen to me.

770
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,720
我知道你妹妹被伤害
I know that your sister got hurt.

771
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,940
那些家伙用最卑鄙的方法伤害了她
That those boys hurt her in the worst way,

772
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,190
她最后也自杀了
and that she took her life.

773
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:21,150
你是在劝我放弃或者别的什么吗? 
Are you trying to talk me down now or something?

774
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:21,960
你在开玩笑呢?
You kidding me?

775
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,880
我是应该这么做 但我从来没做过 
That's what I'm supposed to do, but I've never done this before, so...

776
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,960
闭嘴
Shut up!

777
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:28,700
好的 好的 好的 好的
 OK, OK, alright, alright. Alright.

778
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,840
约翰 情况紧急 你快到了吗?
John, it's escalating, are you close?

779
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,150
快了
Almost there.

780
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:35,240
出去 快啊
Get out! Go!

781
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,510
听我说 好吗?
Just listen to me, okay?

782
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:40,680
我进来 不是因为我是警察
I came in here not because I'm a cop,

783
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:43,050
是因为我
but because I...

784
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,690
我爱他
I love him.

785
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:51,430
我爱他 没有人知道
I'm in love with him and no one knows.

786
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:54,830
我的同事不知道 甚至连他都不知道
None of the people we work with, not even him.

787
00:39:56,620 --> 00:40:00,170
所以如果你 如果你伤了他
So if you... if you hurt him,

788
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,310
我会和你现在的处境一样
I'll be exactly, where you are right now,

789
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:06,040
我爱的人死了 没了
with the person I love dead and gone.

790
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:11,310
我会和你一样痛苦的无法自拔
And I'll be in all the pain you're in.

791
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:13,280
所以我求你了
So I'm asking you,

792
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:15,180
不是因为我是警察
not because I'm a cop,

793
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:19,550
而是因为我不想失去他
but because I don't want to lose him.

794
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:22,360
我爱他 求你了
I love him, please.

795
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:24,640
求你了
Please.

796
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:27,170
碧豆 求你了
Please Beetle.

797
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:33,060
警察 都别动
Police! Don't move!

798
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,030
他在哪? 他在哪?
Where is he? Where is he?

799
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,340
叫救护车
Call an ambulance.

800
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:29,390
猜你今天忙完得喝上一杯
Thought maybe you could use a drink after today.

801
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:30,550
谢谢
Thanks.

802
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:32,740
至少我们救了一个孩子的命 
At least we saved that boy's life,

803
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,220
很了不起 不是吗?
 that's something, right?

804
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,090
干杯
Cheers.

805
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,760
干杯
Cheers.

806
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:47,870
那么杰西卡丽  他们俩什么情况?
So Jesse and Khali, what's happening between those two?

807
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:50,440
只不过是卡丽在劝说嫌犯
It was just Khali working the target.

808
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:52,440
不计代价
Whatever it took.

809
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,640
那就好
Good.

810
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:57,410
因为在同事恋情
'Cause relationships in the same unit,

811
00:41:57,450 --> 00:41:58,780
不会有好结果
they never work.

812
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,420
不会吗
No.

813
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:01,820
不会
No.

814
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:14,460
你知道你今天救了我的命 我想
You know, you saved my life today, I think.

815
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,830
没错
That's right.

816
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:18,770
你欠我好大一个人情
You owe me big time.

817
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:22,640
所以
So...

818
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:29,810
我那时说的是真的吗?
Did I mean everything that I said?

819
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:31,180
是的
Yeah.

820
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:35,180
还是就是为了劝说碧豆?
Or was it just a way to talk down Beetle?

821
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:41,190
你知道我喜欢你
You know that I like you.

822
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,530
你知道
You know...

823
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,570
我们不能继续这样 对吧?
we gotta stop this, right?

824
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,080
我们会的
And we will.
