1
00:00:00,335 --> 00:00:03,468
我感觉很好  嗑药也得到了控制
I feel great,and the pills are under control.

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:04,703
一切都在掌控之中
Everything's under control.

3
00:00:04,704 --> 00:00:06,003
你在超市暴力袭击一位男士
Is it true that you violently

4
00:00:06,004 --> 00:00:07,439
这件事是真的吗
assaulted a man in a supermarket?

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,374
小鲍开始对我们玩阴的了
Bob Little has found a way to go negative.

6
00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:10,742
我们人气现在急转直下
We're down to the wire.

7
00:00:10,743 --> 00:00:12,744
他会把这两百分点的领先优势扩大到五点
He can turn this two-point lead to a five-point lead.

8
00:00:12,745 --> 00:00:14,545
支持率下降了四个百分点
Dropped four points.

9
00:00:14,546 --> 00:00:16,914
我们建议让他在剩下的学年内
We're recommending that he move back to the fourth grade

10
00:00:16,915 --> 00:00:18,649
会到四年级念书
for the rest of the year.

11
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:21,385
我很遗憾  茱莉亚
I'm sorry, Julia.

12
00:00:21,386 --> 00:00:23,554
没人让你辞掉工作
No one asked you to go quit your job.

13
00:00:23,555 --> 00:00:25,289
就跟没人让你私下去找明基朵老师一样
Just like you went and talked to Miss Mikindoe.

14
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,557
这不公平
This isn't fair.

15
00:00:26,558 --> 00:00:28,059
难道我要跟西德妮念同一个年级吗
Then I'll be in the same grade as Sydney?

16
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:29,560
那我的朋友呢
And what about all my friends?

17
00:00:29,561 --> 00:00:30,761
你做得到的
You can do this.

18
00:00:30,762 --> 00:00:32,563
你是个勇敢的男子汉
You're a brave boy.

19
00:00:34,332 --> 00:00:37,368
好了
All right.

20
00:00:37,369 --> 00:00:39,303
- 嘿  维克多  - 干嘛
- Hey, Victor. - What's up?

21
00:00:39,304 --> 00:00:40,471
怎么啦  维克多
What's up, Victor?

22
00:00:40,472 --> 00:00:43,507
老兄  我听说他挂科了
Dude, I heard he flunked.

23
00:00:43,508 --> 00:00:46,076
看那边
Ah, look there.

24
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,647
你做得到的  儿子
You can do this, buddy.

25
00:00:50,648 --> 00:00:52,348
我们会帮你另找一个学校的
You know what,we're gonna take a second.

26
00:00:52,349 --> 00:00:54,016
走吧
Come on.

27
00:00:54,017 --> 00:00:55,618
先去上个厕所
Let's go to the bathroom.

28
00:01:01,492 --> 00:01:02,759
嘿  茱莉亚  怎么了
Hey, Julia, what's up?

29
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,426
- 嘿  - 出什么事了
- Hey. - What's happening?

30
00:01:04,427 --> 00:01:05,861
哦...你知道就那事儿...
Oh, you know...

31
00:01:05,862 --> 00:01:07,396
- 你还好吗  - 还行
- You all right? - Yeah.

32
00:01:07,397 --> 00:01:09,198
嗯...
Um...

33
00:01:09,199 --> 00:01:14,336
今天维克多要换班级了
Today's the day that Victor's changing classrooms.

34
00:01:14,337 --> 00:01:16,038
- 对此我很遗憾   - 没关系的
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

35
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:17,339
他要留级到四年级了
He's going down to fourth.

36
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,607
- 对啊  - 我不是说留级那个意思...
- Yeah. - I didn't mean down to--

37
00:01:18,608 --> 00:01:19,941
转到四..对  随便啦
over to--yeah, whatever,

38
00:01:19,942 --> 00:01:20,942
反正都是到四年级
into fourth.

39
00:01:20,943 --> 00:01:22,444
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

40
00:01:24,113 --> 00:01:27,282
听着  我知道这对你来说很难受  但是...
Look, I know it's hard, but...

41
00:01:27,283 --> 00:01:28,983
但这样做对他最好
It's the best thing for him.

42
00:01:28,984 --> 00:01:30,852
他得待在他该待的地方
You know,he's got to be where he needs to be.

43
00:01:30,853 --> 00:01:31,986
对
Yeah.

44
00:01:31,987 --> 00:01:33,054
眼光要放长远
In the long run, you know.

45
00:01:33,055 --> 00:01:34,756
- 对  - 我很抱歉
- Yeah. - I'm sorry.

46
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:38,659
- 哦~ 嘿  - 呃~ 你还记得艾德吧
- Oh, hey. - Oh, you remember ed?

47
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,061
艾德  当然记得  你好
Ed, yeah, hey.

48
00:01:40,062 --> 00:01:42,864
- 嗨  乔  - 呃...
- Hi, Joel. - Uh...

49
00:01:42,865 --> 00:01:44,866
我们得送这小子去教室了
We got to get this guy to class.

50
00:01:44,867 --> 00:01:46,600
当然...  不好意思
Yeah, sorry.

51
00:01:49,738 --> 00:01:51,372
好吧
Okay.

52
00:02:23,637 --> 00:02:25,938
你坐到我的位子上了
You're in my seat.

53
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:29,442
- 我才没有  - 没错  你现在就坐在我的位子上
- No, I'm not. - Yes, actually, you are.

54
00:02:29,443 --> 00:02:31,210
这是我的椅子
This is my chair,

55
00:02:31,211 --> 00:02:34,113
还有这张是我的书桌  这些都是我的东西
this is my desk, and, like, all my stuff.

56
00:02:34,114 --> 00:02:35,849
这是我老爸的店
My dad owns this whole place.

57
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,450
你爸是汉克吗
Your dad is Hank?

58
00:02:37,751 --> 00:02:39,999
对  我爸就是汉克
Yes, my dad is Hank.

59
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,220
所以这些都是我的东西
Which means all this stuff is mine.

60
00:02:41,221 --> 00:02:42,355
这些都无所谓
It doesn't matter.

61
00:02:42,356 --> 00:02:45,791
可是你还是坐到我的位子上了  而且我现在很忙
You're still in my seat,and I'm swamped.

62
00:02:45,792 --> 00:02:48,560
随你便吧
Whatever.

63
00:02:48,561 --> 00:02:51,063
你移动过我的椅子了
And you moved my chair.

64
00:02:55,802 --> 00:02:57,703
那你是谁  奴役还是什么
So what are you, slave labor or something?

65
00:02:57,704 --> 00:03:00,939
不是  奴隶是违法的
No, slaves are illegal.

66
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,708
那你到底是什么
What are you then?

67
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:05,110
我现在没工夫跟你闲聊
I don't have time to talk right now.

68
00:03:05,111 --> 00:03:07,279
我还有两卷胶片要冲洗
I still have two rolls of film to develop,

69
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,147
而且刚才57路公车还晚点了
and the 57 bus was late,

70
00:03:09,148 --> 00:03:11,149
可能是因为大学街那边堵住了
possibly due to traffic on College Avenue.

71
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,718
有时候交通堵塞
Sometimes the traffic gets blocked up,

72
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:13,952
会影响公车的时刻表
and it affects the bus schedule.

73
00:03:13,953 --> 00:03:16,922
公车时刻表一点也不精确  一点也不
Bus schedules are not precise.Far from it.

74
00:03:16,923 --> 00:03:18,290
所以我来这儿晚了十分钟
So now I'm ten minutes late,

75
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:20,325
而你又耽搁了我另外五分钟时间
and you just wasted another five.

76
00:03:20,326 --> 00:03:22,693
你们俩见过面了对吧
Hey, you guys met, huh?

77
00:03:22,694 --> 00:03:24,896
- 露比  这是麦克斯  - 嗯哼
- Ruby, that's Max. - Mmhmm.

78
00:03:24,897 --> 00:03:27,065
她重新动过我书桌的布局了
She rearranged the stuff on my desk.

79
00:03:27,066 --> 00:03:29,100
他在学习摄影  而且干得非常不错
He's learning photography.He's pretty good.

80
00:03:29,101 --> 00:03:31,702
我去外边买个油炸圈  好吗
Well, I'm going out for a doughnut, okay?

81
00:03:31,703 --> 00:03:32,937
什么  不  不行  等等  等等
What? No, no, hold on. Hold on.

82
00:03:32,938 --> 00:03:34,271
你要是要出去买油炸圈
If you're going to get doughnuts,

83
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,641
那就该先问问
then you should probably find out

84
00:03:36,642 --> 00:03:39,343
还有没有其他人要油炸圈  知道吗
if any of us wants some doughnuts, hmm?

85
00:03:41,713 --> 00:03:44,582
- 你想要油炸圈吗  - 废话
- You want a doughnut? - Sure.

86
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:46,083
好极了
Great.

87
00:03:46,084 --> 00:03:47,919
- 拜  - 拜
- Bye. - Bye.

88
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,189
- 再给我带俩果冻  - 果冻恶心死了
- Couple jelly. - Jelly's gross.

89
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,857
你见过露比了  对吧
So you met Ruby, huh?

90
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:56,860
她得花一段时间才能混熟  但是...
She takes a little while to warm up, but...

91
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:58,062
她多大了
How old is she?

92
00:03:58,063 --> 00:03:59,830
十四岁
14.

93
00:03:59,831 --> 00:04:02,699
十四  很好
14. Perfect.

94
00:04:05,402 --> 00:04:06,903
走吧  我们迟到了不少时间
Let's go, all right? We're late.

95
00:04:06,904 --> 00:04:08,071
- 我们今天得把这个弄完  - 我知道
- We got to get this done. - Yeah, I know.

96
00:04:08,072 --> 00:04:09,539
我迟到了十分钟因为
I was ten minutes late because the bus

97
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,975
- 57路公交车晚点了...  - 嗯  我刚才都听到了

- No. - Kristina Braverman pin?

166
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,620
我了解克里斯蒂娜  她是一位
I know Kristina, and she is someone

167
00:06:21,621 --> 00:06:23,755
真真正正可以代表您跟您家人意愿的人
who would truly represent you and your family.

168
00:06:23,756 --> 00:06:25,391
- 她聪明  诚实...  - 嗨  大家好
- She's smart, she's honest, - Hey, guys.

169
00:06:25,392 --> 00:06:27,859
要克里斯蒂娜・布雷弗曼别针吗  为了竞选市长来着
Kristina Braverman pin? For mayor?

170
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,828
所以请你明天一定出门为她投上一票

171
00:06:29,829 --> 00:06:31,230
- 我绝对会去的  - 我们需要您的一票
- Oh, I will. - We need it.

172
00:06:31,231 --> 00:06:33,698
而且我会拖上我那个整天宅在家的懒鬼老公一起去
And I'll bring my lazy-ass husband with me,too.

173
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:35,234
那谢谢啦  我们一样也需要他的一票
Thank you. We need his vote too.

174
00:06:35,235 --> 00:06:36,735
你真是神了...看看你
You're magic at--look at you.

175
00:06:36,736 --> 00:06:38,336
- 怎么啦  - 我一个都送不出去
- What? - I cannot give these away.

176
00:06:38,337 --> 00:06:39,905
我觉得我连五美元的钞票都送不出去
I don't think I could give away a $5 bill.

177
00:06:39,906 --> 00:06:42,106
太棒了  我爱死这份差事了
Well, this is great. I'm loving this.

178
00:06:42,107 --> 00:06:43,341
对  你完全秒杀众人了
Yeah, you're killing it.

179
00:06:43,342 --> 00:06:44,676
给你一份  请为克里斯蒂娜投上你关键的一票
Here you go, vote for Kristina.

180
00:06:44,677 --> 00:06:45,911
我不想再宣传了
I don't want to instigate,

181
00:06:45,912 --> 00:06:47,612
你却一点也不觉得被冒犯了吗
but you're not offended by this, are you?

182
00:06:47,613 --> 00:06:48,780
没有啊  为什么这么说
No, why?

183
00:06:48,781 --> 00:06:50,481
克里斯蒂娜跟海瑟把我们
Well, the fact that Kristina and Heather

184
00:06:50,482 --> 00:06:51,683
派到这里来
sent us here, you know.

185
00:06:51,684 --> 00:06:53,518
你是她们认识的唯一一个黑人
I mean, you're the only black person they know,

186
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:55,286
所以她们派你来黑人社区
and they sent you to the black neighborhood.

187
00:06:55,287 --> 00:06:56,387
- 我就是觉得  - 才不是呢  你怎么会这样想
- I just think-- - No, why-

188
00:06:56,388 --> 00:06:57,821
反正我是觉得有点不爽
Well, I'm kind of offended for you.

189
00:06:57,822 --> 00:06:59,090
别这样
Don't be.

190
00:06:59,091 --> 00:07:00,558
我是一个名誉上的黑人
I mean, and I'm an honorary black person,

191
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:02,460
- 所以我觉得有点不爽  - 亲爱的  你其实非常
- so I'm a little offended. - Honey, you are very

192
00:07:02,461 --> 00:07:04,529
- 非常白人呢  - 喔哦  在这个范围之内
- very white. - Whoa, on the spectrum,

193
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,597
左右分别是黑人跟白人  亚当在右边
right, of black and white,Adam's here.

194
00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:08,599
- 菲尔科汉在左边  - 那你呢
- Farrakhan's here. - And where are you?

195
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,434
我就在中间  我就在四分之三的...
I'm right here. I'm like 3/4 of the way to--

196
00:07:10,435 --> 00:07:12,836
我觉得要是你这样想  在这个范围之内
Well, I guess if you put it that way, on that spectrum,

197
00:07:12,837 --> 00:07:15,138
跟你哥哥相比  你不如他白
as opposed to your brother, you are not as white as him.

198
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:16,239
既然你不觉得被冒犯的话...
As long as you're not offended...

199
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,875
- 但你还是非常白的  - 那我就...
- But you're still very white. - Then I'm...

200
00:07:17,876 --> 00:07:20,978
不  亲爱的  我真没这么觉得  我真很享受这个过程
No, baby, I'm really not. I'm really into this.

201
00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:22,613
选角以及被选举
You know, elections and voting,

202
00:07:22,614 --> 00:07:24,481
对我来说真的有很重大的意义
it really means a lot to me.

203
00:07:24,482 --> 00:07:26,683
零八年我把票投给了奥巴马
I mean, casting my ballot for Obama in '08

204
00:07:26,684 --> 00:07:28,785
是我这一生中做过的最有意义的事儿了
was one of the most meaningful things I've ever done.

205
00:07:28,786 --> 00:07:31,455
你想想  我们经历了那么多困难
You know,like,thinking about how far we've come,

206
00:07:31,456 --> 00:07:34,524
我还帮助选举了史上第一位黑人总统
and that I helped to elect the first black president.

207
00:07:34,525 --> 00:07:36,726
我从未想过这件事会在我活着的时候发生
I mean, I never thought that
would happen in my lifetime.

208
00:07:36,727 --> 00:07:38,528
我知道你很难把这两件事联系在一起
I mean,I know you can't really relate to that,

209
00:07:38,529 --> 00:07:39,862
- 但是...-  我当然可以
- but. - Yeah, I can.

210
00:07:39,863 --> 00:07:41,098
- 真的吗  - 绝对可以
- Really? - Totally.

211
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:42,799
我不认为这是肤色问题
I don't think that was a black-white thing.

212
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,901
这真的是我所了解的意义深远的
I mean, it was really a profound moment

213
00:07:44,902 --> 00:07:45,935
- 时刻  - 确实是
- I got-- - It was.

214
00:07:45,936 --> 00:07:47,937
对  当我投票的时候  我情绪非常激动
Yeah, when I voted, I got emotional.

215
00:07:47,938 --> 00:07:49,371
- 我还哭了呢  - 是吗
I cried. - You did?

216
00:07:49,372 --> 00:07:50,940
- 对  我哭了  - 我都不知道诶
- Yeah,I cried--yeah. - I didn't know that,aw.

217
00:07:50,941 --> 00:07:52,141
哭的跟个孩子似的
Like a baby.

218
00:07:52,142 --> 00:07:53,843
还记得你第一次得到小贴纸的时候吗
Remember when you got your Little sticker?

219
00:07:53,844 --> 00:07:55,511
当然记得  我现在还留着呢
Yeah, I still have it someplace.

220
00:07:55,512 --> 00:07:56,278
- 是吗  - 当然  我觉得应该还在
- You do? - Yeah, I think so.

221
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:58,114
- 我也还留着呢  - 是吗
- So do I. - Yeah?

222
00:07:58,115 --> 00:08:00,449
哦~~
Aw.

223
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:02,784
你最好了
You're the best.

224
00:08:02,785 --> 00:08:04,453
我爱死你了
I love you.

225
00:08:04,454 --> 00:08:07,323
好了  你想让其显像的部分
Okay,so the area that you want to bring out more,

226
00:08:07,324 --> 00:08:09,791
你就打开灯光  把那个部分放在这个小洞上
you let the light on through
the hole just a little more.

227
00:08:09,792 --> 00:08:10,892
你只需要盯着就行
You just go over it.

228
00:08:10,893 --> 00:08:12,861
所以要是我们想让栅栏显像出来的话
So we want that fence to come out.

229
00:08:12,862 --> 00:08:14,696
就往上抬一点  来  你来试试
So we just go up. Here, you try it.

230
00:08:14,697 --> 00:08:17,099
只需要让光线透过栅栏
We just want that light on that fence.

231
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,201
好了
All right.

232
00:08:20,202 --> 00:08:23,538
我想让露比做我女朋友
I have intentions of asking Ruby to be my girlfriend.

233
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:27,609
什么
What?

234
00:08:29,578 --> 00:08:31,379
你作为父亲  我觉得应该让你知道
As the father,I thought you should know.

235
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:35,783
我...等..等...不行  麦克斯  呃...
I mean--ho, ho, no, Max, uh...

236
00:08:35,784 --> 00:08:37,852
这样做可不太好
That's not a good idea.

237
00:08:37,853 --> 00:08:40,888
- 为什么不好  - 因为她是我女儿
- Why not? - 'Cause she's my daughter.

238
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:42,823
我知道  要不是这样我们还遇不到呢
I know. That's how we met.

239
00:08:42,824 --> 00:08:45,826
那你为什么想让她做你女朋友
Why do you even want her as a girlfriend anyway?

240
00:08:45,827 --> 00:08:48,462
她穿着鲨鱼衫
She was wearing a sharks shirt.

241
00:08:48,463 --> 00:08:50,397
- 没错  - 而我是鲨鱼粉
- Yeah. - I'm a sharks fan.

242
00:08:50,398 --> 00:08:51,966
这就说明我们有共同爱好
That means we have common interests.

243
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:54,334
更何况我们年纪相仿  我是男生  她又是女生
Also,we're both 14,and I'm a boy,and she's a girl,

244
00:08:54,335 --> 00:08:57,571
这就说明她符合所有条件
which means she meets all the requirements.

245
00:08:57,572 --> 00:08:59,339
麦克斯  别这样
You know, Max, come on.

246
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,275
首先  她生活在明尼苏达州
First of all, she lives in Minnesota.

247
00:09:01,276 --> 00:09:03,510
而且她很喜怒无常  你已经见识过了  不是吗
She's moody.You saw what she's like,right?

248
00:09:03,511 --> 00:09:05,712
我明天就问她
I'm asking her tomorrow.

249
00:09:14,989 --> 00:09:16,956
嘿  你在这儿干嘛呢
Hey,what are you doing up here?

250
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:18,124
你觉得我看起来是在干嘛
What does it look like?

251
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,660
看起来你好像是在
Well, it looks like you're profiling

252
00:09:19,661 --> 00:09:21,260
素描一个连环杀手之类的东西
a serial killer or something.

253
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:22,929
你现在在联邦调查局找到工作了吗
Have you taken a job with the FBI?

254
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,031
可能吧  机缘巧合...  我也不清楚
Maybe, by accident, I don't know.

255
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:27,233
太糟糕了  这到底是个什么样的体制啊
This is terrible.What kind of system is this?

256
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:29,235
- 我都搞晕了  - 这是你亚当舅舅弄的
- I'm so confused. - Oh, this is your Uncle Adam.

257
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:30,770
他喜欢那些旧玩意儿
He loves anything antiquated.

258
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:33,106
纸啊  蒸汽机啊
Paper, steam engines.

259
00:09:33,107 --> 00:09:33,907
- 要是他能骑一匹马  - 我真的很喜欢...
- if he could ride  - I would really love to...

260
00:09:33,908 --> 00:09:35,108
来上班的话  他肯定会这样做的
a horse to work, he would.

261
00:09:35,109 --> 00:09:37,376
这玩意儿太糟了  我们得设法越过去
It's really bad.We should try to move past this.

262
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:38,477
你很忙对吧
Well, you're busy.

263
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:40,045
我本来打算让你下楼来帮我
I was gonna ask you to help me downstairs

264
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:41,980
做一些有创造性有艺术气息和音乐感的事儿的
with something creative and artistic and musical,

265
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:43,683
- 但看样子你是不会有兴趣了 - 什么
- but that wouldn't interest you. - What?

266
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:45,618
- 这件事看样子...  - 你在说什么呢
-The case seems to be -What are you talking about?

267
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:47,153
现在很热的  所以我先希望你能找到你要找的罪犯
Hot right now, so I hope you find your man.

268
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:49,222
克罗斯比  等等
Crosby! Wait!

269
00:09:49,523 --> 00:09:50,723
现在情况是这样的
Here's what's happening.

270
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:53,526
明天我们会有一个后备歌手来录音
Tomorrow we have backup vocalists coming in to record.

271
00:09:53,527 --> 00:09:54,526
好吧  所以呢
Okay, so?

272
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:55,627
我们需要临时音轨
We need a scratch track,

273
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,062
这就需要你来加入了
and that's where you come in.

274
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:58,130
- 你要来唱临时音轨  - 什么

- 没错  就是要你来唱  - 不  我还没准备好呢
- Yes, you are. - No, 'cause I'm not ready.

277
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,201
机会可不是每天都有的  所以你还是先唱吧
Opportunities do not come every day, so please.

278
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:03,501
唱什么  唱《带你回家》吗
For what, for taking you home?

279
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:04,770
我没有...我不...不不不不
I don't have--I'm not--no, no, no, no, no.

280
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,304
你了解这首歌  是也不是
Hey, you know the song or not?

281
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:08,506
- 没错  你了解  - 我是了解  但我还没准备好
- Yes, you do. - I know it, but I'm not ready.

282
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:10,542
我得先开开声之类的
I have to get my voice warmed up and stuff.

283
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,277
你们早就准备好了是不是
You're gonna be in here for this?

284
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,945
玩真的吗
Really?

285
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,980
好了  开始了
Okay, here we go.

286
00:10:15,981 --> 00:10:18,617
【音乐声起】

【清嗓子】

288
00:10:20,819 --> 00:10:26,491
? 难道我不愿意再次抓住你

289
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:30,628
? 我们醉得如此厉害

290
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:34,598
? 还忙着将它留在你的眼中

291

292
00:10:37,302 --> 00:10:39,270
? 一些我们看不见的东西

294
00:10:43,408 --> 00:10:48,779
? 我们只是在迷恋

299
00:11:05,062 --> 00:11:10,566
? 我本该带你回家

300
00:11:10,567 --> 00:11:16,239
? 我本该带你回家

301
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,310
? 我本该带你回家

00:11:25,982 --> 00:11:28,785
? 带你回家

305
00:11:28,786 --> 00:11:30,787
- 嗨  - 嘿
- Hi. - Hey.

306
00:11:30,788 --> 00:11:32,422
不好意思回来晚了
Sorry it's kind of late.

307
00:11:32,423 --> 00:11:34,623
- 没错  - 嘿  亲爱的
- Yep. - Hey, bud.

308
00:11:34,624 --> 00:11:37,960
天呐  今天真是太美好了
Oh, my gosh, it's such a good day.

309
00:11:37,961 --> 00:11:39,428
你过得怎么样
How's it going?

310
00:11:39,429 --> 00:11:41,697
- 很好  - 很好吗  那就好
- Good. - Good. Great.

311
00:11:41,698 --> 00:11:44,466
我做了晚饭  但是...
I got dinner for us but I...

312
00:11:44,467 --> 00:11:46,101
- 没关系的  - 我已经吃过了
- Oh, that's okay. - I already ate it.

313
00:11:46,102 --> 00:11:47,736
- 你可以加热后再吃  - 没关系的
- You can heat it up. - That's okay.

314
00:11:47,737 --> 00:11:49,471
我其实还不怎么饿
I'm actually not that hungry anyway.

315
00:11:49,472 --> 00:11:50,772
天呐  我今天过得真是太棒了
God, I had such a good day.

316
00:11:50,773 --> 00:11:53,274
我今天给乐队录了一段临时音轨
I recorded a guide vocal track today with the band.

317
00:11:53,275 --> 00:11:55,844
- 不错  - 对啊  你能相信吗
- Cool. - Yeah, can you believe it?

318
00:11:55,845 --> 00:11:56,878
听起来不错
That sounds cool.

319
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:58,079
我真的紧张死了
And I was really nervous,

320
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,348
因为  我...
because, I was, like,

321
00:11:59,349 --> 00:12:01,182
不得不在那群男生面前唱
having to sing in front of those boys,

322
00:12:01,183 --> 00:12:03,618
但效果其实还是相当不错
but it actually went really, really well.

323
00:12:03,619 --> 00:12:04,619
肯定的
Of course.

324
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,787
所以  还算不错了
So, I don't know, it was good.

325
00:12:05,788 --> 00:12:08,456
我...我也不好说啦
I mean, I don't know.

326
00:12:08,457 --> 00:12:10,225
你呢  今天过得怎么样
So how about you? How was your day?

327
00:12:10,226 --> 00:12:12,827
挺好的  我下班回家挺早的
It was good, I got home early so

328
00:12:12,828 --> 00:12:14,863
所以我点了你最喜欢吃的
I ordered your favorite, you know,

329
00:12:14,864 --> 00:12:17,999
本来想来个浪漫的晚餐的
and I just,I thought we'd have a romantic dinner,

330
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,936
但我不知道你会回来的这么晚
but I didn't know you were going
to be getting home so late.

331
00:12:25,374 --> 00:12:27,040
你生我气了吗
Are you mad at me?

332
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,275
没有  就是有点不高兴
No, I'm just bummed.

333
00:12:28,276 --> 00:12:30,210
我点了食物还准备好了一切
You know, I got all that food and everything.

334
00:12:30,211 --> 00:12:33,647
不是因为那些
No, not about that.

335
00:12:33,648 --> 00:12:36,617
我感觉好像自从我们处理了戒指之后...
I feel like ever since we dealt with the ring...

336
00:12:36,618 --> 00:12:37,951
- 没有的事  - 我不知道
- No! - I don't know,

337
00:12:37,952 --> 00:12:39,552
- 感觉就好像我们有了距离感  - 不  跟戒指
- like a little distant or-- - No, there's nothing

338
00:12:39,553 --> 00:12:41,021
没有关系  我们已经处理好了那件事儿了
about the ring.We've already dealt with that.

339
00:12:41,022 --> 00:12:43,023
- 现在没事儿了  就...  - 我知道 但我...
- It's fine now, it's-- - I know, but I just-

340
00:12:43,024 --> 00:12:44,391
但我觉得你觉得我
it feels like you took it really personally,

341
00:12:44,392 --> 00:12:45,592
- 根本不喜欢它一样  - 它根本不值得留在我们脑中
- like I didn't like it.- It's not worth in our minds.

342
00:12:45,593 --> 00:12:47,560
不  它根本就不值得来谈
No, it's not even worth talking about.

343
00:12:47,561 --> 00:12:50,030
我很高兴  这样做很好  我就是想你了而已
I'm happy.It's great.I just missed you, that's all.

344
00:12:50,031 --> 00:12:51,865
我只是想你了
I just miss you.

345
00:12:51,866 --> 00:12:53,333
好吧
Okay.

346
00:12:53,334 --> 00:12:54,567
- 我没生气  - 好吧  好吧
- I'm not mad. - Okay, okay.

347
00:12:54,568 --> 00:12:56,669
- 我向你保证  - 好吧
- I promise. - Okay.

348
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,571
我保证
I promise.

349
00:12:58,572 --> 00:13:01,408
好吧
Okay.

350
00:13:01,409 --> 00:13:03,209
我真的好想你
I just really missed you,you know.

351
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:04,778
- 我也很想你  - 嗯哼
- I missed you too. - Mm-hmm.

352
00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:07,179
- 嘿  - 干嘛
- Hey. - What?

353
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,548
还有一件事
There was one other thing

354
00:13:08,549 --> 00:13:10,983
我想跟你速战速决
I wanted to talk to you about real fast.

355
00:13:10,984 --> 00:13:12,051
- 什么事  - 等等
- What? - Wait, wait.

356
00:13:12,052 --> 00:13:13,052
怎么啦
What?

357
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:22,494
你又在吃那些药了吗
Are you taking those pills again?

358
00:13:22,495 --> 00:13:23,862
什么药
What?

359
00:13:23,863 --> 00:13:25,331
我之前洗衣服的时候
I was doing laundry,

360
00:13:25,332 --> 00:13:28,067
我去拿你的衣服来洗
and I was putting some of your stuff away,babe,

361
00:13:28,068 --> 00:13:30,068
然后就在你包里发现了那些玩意儿
and I saw that they were in there,

362
00:13:30,069 --> 00:13:31,236
然后我...
and I just--

363
00:13:31,237 --> 00:13:32,604
我没有
no.

364
00:13:32,605 --> 00:13:35,841
那是个...是个老方子了
That's a--I mean,that's an old prescription.

365
00:13:35,842 --> 00:13:40,512
但我实在两周前发现的
Well, it's from two weeks ago.

366
00:13:40,513 --> 00:13:43,515
我知道  我...我...我没有...
Yeah, I know.I-I-I haven't--

367
00:13:43,516 --> 00:13:45,350
他们没停止  但我...
they haven't stopped it, but I--

368
00:13:45,351 --> 00:13:46,952
那是之前的老方子了
it's an old prescription from before.

369
00:13:46,953 --> 00:13:48,053
我甚至都没需要过它
I don't even need it.

370
00:13:48,054 --> 00:13:49,354
那些事抗焦虑药...
Those are anxiety pills that are--

371
00:13:49,355 --> 00:13:52,490
亲爱的  你吃不吃其实无所谓的
babe,I--it doesn't bother me if you take them,

372
00:13:52,491 --> 00:13:53,691
我真没吃过
I just--I'm not taking them.

373
00:13:53,692 --> 00:13:55,160
- 好吧 好吧  - 我根本就不需要
- Okay, okay. - I don't even need them.

374
00:13:55,161 --> 00:13:57,762
我只是想...那让我感觉你好像在瞒着我什么事
I just wanted--it felt like you were hiding it from me,

375
00:13:57,763 --> 00:13:59,364
- 我想让你知道你没有必要隐瞒我  - 没有
- and I want you to know you don't have to. - No.

376
00:13:59,365 --> 00:14:01,032
不不不  我没有隐瞒你任何事
No, no, I'm not hiding anything from you.

377
00:14:01,033 --> 00:14:03,835
我只是不想让你因此紧张或是害怕
I just didn't want you to be nervous or freak out about it.

378
00:14:03,836 --> 00:14:04,836
好吧
Okay.

379
00:14:08,874 --> 00:14:10,541
我爱你

380
00:14:13,044 --> 00:14:16,747
? 最后一次尝试
? One last try

381
00:14:16,748 --> 00:14:18,349
【手机铃声响了】
[cell phone chimes]

382
00:14:29,627 --> 00:14:31,895
我希望他能睡得着叫

383
00:14:31,896 --> 00:14:33,730
嗯  那天现在怎么样

384
00:14:33,731 --> 00:14:36,299
一直在强忍着
Stoic.

385
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,334
你有条艾德・布鲁克斯的短信

386
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,871

391
00:14:52,116 --> 00:14:55,118
不想
Nope.

392

我很好
I'm good.

393
00:14:59,129 --> 00:15:00,830
你们必须得投票吗
Do you have to vote?

394
00:15:00,831 --> 00:15:03,499
你是没有责任  但你有义务这样做
You don't have to, but you should.

395
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,601
这是作为一个民主国家的公民
You know,it's your civic responsibility,

396

应尽的义务

397
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:08,838
这是建立政府的最伟大之处

398
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:11,440
应为你可以告诉他们你自己的想法

399
00:15:11,441 --> 00:15:13,108
走吧  去帮你的伯母

竞选成为这座美丽城市的市长吧

- Well, good for you.- Yeah.

408
00:15:25,388 --> 00:15:27,522
我们要投给克里斯蒂娜・布雷弗曼
Our candidate is Kristina Braverman.

409
00:15:27,523 --> 00:15:29,224
她是个非常帮的候选人
She's a heck of a candidate.

410
00:15:29,225 --> 00:15:30,558
你是布雷弗曼的支持者吗
Are you a Braverman supporter?

411
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:33,327
我们这的不能讨论这个
We're really not supposed to talk about this.

412
00:15:33,328 --> 00:15:34,395
名字  谢谢
Name, please.

413
00:15:34,396 --> 00:15:36,197

- Crosby Braverman. - Braverman.

414
00:15:36,198 --> 00:15:38,132
就跟候选人克里斯蒂娜・布雷弗曼一个姓
Just like the candidate, Kristina Braverman.

415
00:15:38,133 --> 00:15:41,102
我没在名单上看到你的名字
I don't see your name on our list.

416
00:15:41,103 --> 00:15:43,505
你确定你是这个选区的吗
Are you sure this is your polling place?

417
00:15:43,506 --> 00:15:45,840
我就住在那条街  所以我...
Well, I live right up the street, so I--

418
00:15:45,841 --> 00:15:47,341
你应该有张印着你的
well, you should have gotten a postcard

419
00:15:47,342 --> 00:15:49,076
选区的明信片
with your polling place on it.

420
00:15:49,077 --> 00:15:52,079
对  但肯定是这个地方
Right,this would have to be the place.

421
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,381
这里离我家这么近
It's so close to my house.

422
00:15:53,382 --> 00:15:56,950
你作为选民已经多久了
How long has it been since you voted?

423
00:15:56,951 --> 00:15:59,120
跟这没什么关系吧
That's not entirely relevant.

424
00:15:59,121 --> 00:16:01,155
是不是有张表格我需要填
If there's a form or something I've got to fill out

425
00:16:01,156 --> 00:16:02,723
选民注册表
the voter registration form.

426
00:16:02,724 --> 00:16:05,526
但是你不能在选举这天去注册
You can't register to vote the day of the election.

427
00:16:05,527 --> 00:16:07,027
为什么不能
Why not?

428
00:16:07,028 --> 00:16:09,295
因为这样行不通
Because it doesn't work that way.

429
00:16:09,296 --> 00:16:10,397
好了  听我说
Okay, listen to me.

430
00:16:10,398 --> 00:16:12,032
我可算是美国遵纪守法的纳税好公民
I am an American citizen who pay my taxes.

431
00:16:12,033 --> 00:16:14,701
我父亲是一名越战老兵  而且布雷弗曼家族...
My father is a Vietnam vet,and the Bravermans--

432
00:16:14,702 --> 00:16:17,404
先生  你现在让后面的人排起了长队
sir, now you are holding up the line.

433
00:16:17,405 --> 00:16:19,172
我只是...投给克里斯蒂娜・布雷弗曼
I'm just--Kristina Braverman.

434
00:16:19,173 --> 00:16:20,540
是不是还有其他办法
If there's another way

435
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:22,542
可以解决这事儿  我需要投票
for me to sort this out,I need to vote.

436
00:16:22,543 --> 00:16:24,644
我需要你离开
And I need you to leave.

437
00:16:24,645 --> 00:16:27,347
你没在这儿注册
You are not registered here.

438
00:16:27,348 --> 00:16:28,648
但是我们不是要进去
But don't we get to go inside

439
00:16:28,649 --> 00:16:30,083
按下所有的按钮吗
and push all the buttons?

440
00:16:30,084 --> 00:16:33,786
听着  我本来打算悄悄投票的
Listen,okay,you know what,I wanted to vote privately,

441
00:16:33,787 --> 00:16:35,422
但她现在要求我公开投票
but now she has forced us

442
00:16:35,423 --> 00:16:36,889
说这样更好
to vote publicly,which is fine.

443
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:38,257
我们要公开投票
We'll vote publicly.

444
00:16:38,258 --> 00:16:40,492
所以  我  克罗斯比・布雷弗曼
So I, Crosby braverman,

445
00:16:40,493 --> 00:16:42,461
要为克里斯蒂娜・布雷弗曼成为市长
vote for Kristina braverman

446
00:16:42,462 --> 00:16:44,030
- 投上一票  - 我也是
- for mayor. - Me too.

447
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,197
我们公开投票
We voted publicly.

448
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:46,465
你们各位要见证这一切
You guys witnessed it.

449
00:16:46,466 --> 00:16:49,268
记下来  我们等她赢的时候再见
Mark it down,and we'll see you when she wins.

450
00:16:52,138 --> 00:16:54,906
你愿意做我女朋友吗
So do you want to be my girlfriend?

451
00:16:54,907 --> 00:16:56,341
什么
What?

452
00:16:56,342 --> 00:16:58,610
你愿意做我的女朋友吗
Do you want to be my girlfriend?

453
00:16:58,611 --> 00:17:01,413
嗯...
Um...

00:17:01,414 --> 00:17:04,183
不可能
Not gonna happen.

455
00:17:04,184 --> 00:17:06,318
为什么
Why?

456
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,853
不好意思  我现在有事要做
Excuse me,I'm doing something.

457
00:17:16,528 --> 00:17:18,964
嘿  露比  你能过来一下吗
Hey, Ruby, come here for a second please.

458
00:17:22,768 --> 00:17:23,802
干嘛
What?

459
00:17:23,803 --> 00:17:26,071
对他好点儿
Just be, like, nicer to him.

460
00:17:26,072 --> 00:17:27,738
- 好吗  - 什么
- All right? - What?

461
00:17:27,739 --> 00:17:29,307
就麦克斯  你放他一马吧
Just Max. Just cut him a break.

462
00:17:29,308 --> 00:17:31,109
你在说什么呢  他是那个...
What are you talking about?He's the one--

463
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:35,113
我只是让你稍微对他好一点儿而已
I'm just saying be a little bit nicer,that's all.

464
00:17:35,114 --> 00:17:36,114
那我是要当他女朋友吗
So be his girlfriend?

465
00:17:36,115 --> 00:17:39,650
不是  我不是那个意思
No, I'm not saying that.

466
00:17:39,651 --> 00:17:42,487
听着  他不会有任何实际行动的
Look, he's not gonna do anything.

467
00:17:42,488 --> 00:17:45,355
他也只是这么说说而已
He just wants to say he has a girlfriend,that's all.

468
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:48,391
这是男人之间的事儿
It's a guy thing.

469
00:17:48,392 --> 00:17:50,160
你要回到明尼苏达的对吧
I mean, you're gonna be in Minnesota, right?

470
00:17:50,161 --> 00:17:52,896
所以这么做做又有何妨呢
So what's the harm really?

471
00:17:52,897 --> 00:17:55,398
别...拜托
Oh, don't--come on.

472
00:17:55,399 --> 00:17:56,767
我不能相信你
I can't believe you.

473
00:17:56,768 --> 00:17:59,436
好了 露比
All right, Ruby.

- That's so unfair. - Sydney, go to your room,

但是这样对你是最好的

496
00:18:45,948 --> 00:18:47,248
为什么  是因为我是个吊车尾吗
Why, because I'm a 'tard?

所以一定是这样的
so it must be true.

503
00:18:56,059 --> 00:18:57,959
伊桑这么说的  我会告诉学校的

00:20:47,719 --> 00:20:49,152
你开玩笑呢  说真的  这...
Trying to be funny? Really? Just--

545
00:20:49,153 --> 00:20:50,987
听着  我知道  我知道这确实让你压力山大
Listen,I know.I'm sure it's very stressful.

546
00:20:50,988 --> 00:20:53,523
你得告诉他们做好保护措施
Just tell them they have to use protection.

547
00:20:55,092 --> 00:20:56,793
我来这儿是想寻求你的建议的
You know,I come here for advice--

548
00:20:56,794 --> 00:20:59,195
有什么问题吗  我没觉着有什么不好啊
Well, what happened?I don't get what's wrong.

549
00:20:59,196 --> 00:21:01,097
哪里有问题吗  她还没准备好这一切
What's wrong? She's not ready for this.

550
00:21:01,098 --> 00:21:04,067
麦克斯也没有
And Max doesn't, you know,

551
00:21:04,068 --> 00:21:06,068
他甚至都不知道自己为什么要个女朋友
he doesn't even know why he wants a girlfriend.

552
00:21:06,069 --> 00:21:07,637
他只是在照章办事
He's just checking stuff off a list.

553
00:21:07,638 --> 00:21:09,271
你还没准备好这一切吗
You're not ready for this.

554
00:21:09,272 --> 00:21:11,173
她已经十四了  马上就要成年了
She's 14 and,you know,it's right around the corner.

555
00:21:11,174 --> 00:21:12,575
她还没准备好  没准备好  好吗
She's not ready. She's not ready, okay?

556
00:21:12,576 --> 00:21:13,776
- 好吧  - 顺便提一句
- Okay. - And by the way,

557
00:21:13,777 --> 00:21:15,645
她觉得麦克斯很怪
she thinks he's weird, you know.

558
00:21:15,646 --> 00:21:16,879
他当然会这么觉得
Of course she does,

559
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,649
但你对她怎么说的
but what did you say to her?

560
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:20,750
她...
She just, you know,

561
00:21:20,751 --> 00:21:22,051
她认为我要把她
she thinks I'm trying to sell her

562
00:21:22,052 --> 00:21:23,352
买去当妓女之类的
into prostitution or something.

563
00:21:23,353 --> 00:21:24,753
天呐  你到底对她说什么了
Oh, my God.What did you say to her?

564
00:21:24,754 --> 00:21:27,323
我告诉她  为什么她不能
I told her, why doesn't she just

565
00:21:27,324 --> 00:21:29,124
假装是麦克斯的女朋友呢
pretend to be his girlfriend,

566
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:30,993
反正她不久就会回明尼苏达州
because she's going to Minnesota.

567
00:21:30,994 --> 00:21:32,328
- 天呐  - 她立马就掉头走开了
- Oh, my God. - She's going away.

568
00:21:32,329 --> 00:21:33,662
又没有什么坏处  没什么大碍
There's no harm. There's no foul.

569
00:21:33,663 --> 00:21:35,630
- 他又不会知道  - 这真是最糟的建议了
- He doesn't know. - That's the worst advice,

570
00:21:35,631 --> 00:21:36,832
她当然会生气咯
of course she's upset.

571
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:39,501
你让她跟麦克斯撒谎
You told her to lie to Max.

572
00:21:39,502 --> 00:21:41,169
是对他好点  不是撒谎  是对他好一点
To be nice, not lie.Just be nice.

573
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,370
这不是在让她对他好
That's not being nice though.

574
00:21:42,371 --> 00:21:43,605
这是在叫她撒谎
It teaches her that you lie

575
00:21:43,606 --> 00:21:45,406
以便自己能脱身于一个奇怪的处境
to get out of a tricky situation,

576
00:21:45,407 --> 00:21:47,542
而且   对他来说
and anyway, for him, you know,

577
00:21:47,543 --> 00:21:49,377
他得自己去搞懂
he's gonna have to figure out,

578
00:21:49,378 --> 00:21:52,180
并不是你说喜欢她那个女孩就得当你女朋友
you don't have a girlfriend just
because you say you like her.

579
00:21:52,181 --> 00:21:55,683
她也得喜欢你才行  这是双边的关系
She has to like you back.It's a two-way street.

580
00:21:58,487 --> 00:22:01,255
你说得对
Oh, you're right.

581
00:22:01,256 --> 00:22:03,057
女孩太难伺候了
Oh, girls are the worst.

582
00:22:03,058 --> 00:22:04,825
什么
Huh?

583
00:22:04,826 --> 00:22:07,128
我说  谢谢你
I said thanks, yeah.

584
00:22:07,129 --> 00:22:08,329
- 好吧  - 你说得对
- Okay. - Yeah, you're right.

585
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:10,331
好吧
All right.

586
00:22:10,332 --> 00:22:12,132
你真该把门锁上  知道吗
You should really lock this,okay?

587
00:22:12,133 --> 00:22:15,569
这一带有些奇怪的家伙  我还看见了一只丛林狼
There's a weird guy. I saw a coyote.

588
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:17,004
多谢提醒
Thanks.

589
00:22:23,712 --> 00:22:27,381
嘿  还是我
Hey, it's me, again.

590
00:22:27,382 --> 00:22:29,216
我知道我都给你打了五通电话了
I know I've called you like five times,

591
00:22:29,217 --> 00:22:31,218
可是维克多今天真的不好过
but Victor's having a really rough day,

592
00:22:31,219 --> 00:22:34,554
我也知道你很忙
and I know you're busy, but

593
00:22:34,555 --> 00:22:36,223
但我今天也过得很糟
I'm having a really rough day,

594
00:22:36,224 --> 00:22:38,191
我现在只想跟你聊聊
and I just wanted to talk to you,

595
00:22:38,192 --> 00:22:42,362
要是你有时间的话
so, you know, if you get a chance,

596
00:22:42,363 --> 00:22:46,933
要是你收到这条消息的话  请回我电话
if you get this message,please call me.

597
00:22:46,934 --> 00:22:49,101
好吧  谢了
Okay, thanks.

598
00:22:54,842 --> 00:22:56,175
唔~~
Ooh.

599
00:22:56,176 --> 00:22:57,744
- 啊哈哈  - 耶
- Ah-ha-ha. - Yeah.

600
00:22:57,745 --> 00:23:01,280
两个人也能玩这个游戏
Well, two can play at this game.

601
00:23:01,281 --> 00:23:02,381
嘿
Hey.

602
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:03,916
你也得将我军
And you got to king me too, so...

603
00:23:03,917 --> 00:23:05,851
- 嘿  - 嘿
- Hey. - Hey.

604
00:23:05,852 --> 00:23:07,886
- 看看我给你带了什么  - 哇哦
- Look what I got for you. - Whoa!

605
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:11,157
真酷  谢谢
Cool, thanks.

606
00:23:11,158 --> 00:23:12,525
现在只要你满了十八岁
Now when you're 18,

607
00:23:12,526 --> 00:23:14,393
你也可以选举了
you'll get to vote too.

608
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:16,795
这是我们作为一个公民的最高荣誉
It's one of our greatest honors as citizens.

609
00:23:16,796 --> 00:23:18,129
对  我知道  老爸跟我说过
Yeah, I know. Dad told me.

610
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,531
真的吗  真棒
Oh, really? Good.

611
00:23:19,532 --> 00:23:20,966
肯定的  天佑美帝
You bet. God bless America.

612
00:23:20,967 --> 00:23:22,734
- 没错  - 好了  那是个好动机
- That's right.- Okay, that's a good move.

613
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:25,370
等等  老妈  你想公开选举还是私下选举
Wait,mommy,did you vote public or private?

614
00:23:25,371 --> 00:23:26,705
- 什么  - 哦哦~  我要走了
- What? - Uh-oh, here we go.

615
00:23:26,706 --> 00:23:27,706
你要公开还是私人选举
Did you vote public or private?

616
00:23:27,707 --> 00:23:29,174
我要走这个
I'm taking this guy.

617
00:23:29,175 --> 00:23:30,677
什么是公开或私人选举
What's public or private?

618
00:23:30,678 --> 00:23:31,977
老爸就是公开选举的
Well,daddy voted public.

619
00:23:31,978 --> 00:23:34,079
- 他告诉桌子边的那位夫人  - 你在说什么呢
- He just told the lady - What are you talking?

620
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,013
- 他要投给谁票  - 哦
- at the table who he was voting for. - Oh.

621
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:37,449
- 那就是公开选举  - 哦
- That's voting public. - Oh.

622
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,984
而进去投票的人就是私下选举
The people that go into the booth are voting private.

623
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:41,752
这是不是跟你说的一样  老爸
Isn't that what you said, daddy?

624
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:44,255
我觉得你会有麻烦的
I think you're gonna get swamped here

625
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:48,393
要是你不...我是好像说过这话
if you don't-I may have said something like that.

626
00:23:48,394 --> 00:23:50,527
听起来像..像...
Something that sounds like--something like--

627
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:52,262
你的招贴呢
where's your sticker?

628
00:23:52,263 --> 00:23:53,864
对啊  你的招贴呢
Yeah, where's your sticker?

629
00:23:56,602 --> 00:24:01,606
?我本该带你回家

?I should have taken you home

632

633
00:24:14,952 --> 00:24:17,421
?带你回家

634
00:24:17,422 --> 00:24:18,589

00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:21,158
?我本该带你
?I should have taken--

636
00:24:25,395 --> 00:24:26,630
- 你说得没错  - 是的

637
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,131
- 我们很棒  - 对

00:24:28,132 --> 00:24:29,332
- 就像...  - 你确定
- Like... - Are you sure?

639
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:31,034
就别把钱花在什么后备歌手身上了
Let's not spend money on a back-up singer.

640
00:24:31,035 --> 00:24:32,135
肯定呀
Absolutely.

641
00:24:32,136 --> 00:24:33,536
因为这首听起来很棒  对吧
'Cause that sounds great, right?

642
00:24:33,537 --> 00:24:35,872
- 她听起来太棒了  - 不好意思  什么
- Yeah, she sounds great.- I'm sorry, what?

643
00:24:35,873 --> 00:24:37,373
你听起来太棒了
You sound good.

644
00:24:37,374 --> 00:24:39,275
你是在说你要把这首歌
Wait,you're not saying you're gonna keep

645
00:24:39,276 --> 00:24:40,709
收录到你们的专辑里面吗
that for your album?

646
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:42,878
- 真的吗  - 你是说真的
- Yes. - Are you serious?

647
00:24:42,879 --> 00:24:45,481
- 哇哦  - 你是说真的吗
- Whoa-- - are you serious?

648
00:24:45,482 --> 00:24:48,083
怎么...你们疯了吗
What the--you guys are crazy.

649
00:24:48,084 --> 00:24:49,619
太感谢了
Thank you so much.

650
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,053
- 奥利弗  我的天呐  - 别谢我
- Oliver, oh, my God. - Don't thank me.

651
00:24:51,054 --> 00:24:53,055
要谢就谢这家伙吧  是他推荐用你的
Thank he-man over here.He just got you in there.

Hey,look.When it's good it's good, right?

Two more songs,we got a record.

654
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,627
好了  现在能去喝酒了吗

I'm a Boston cream guy.

666
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:17,712
你要不吃的话  他会打你的
You never know,he might punch you.

667
00:25:17,713 --> 00:25:19,648
- 我就吃一个  - 你已经见识过他有多暴力了
- I'm gonna take one.- You've seen how violent he is.

668
00:25:19,649 --> 00:25:21,449
我来帮你们发吧
I'm gonna pass these out for you.

669
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:24,186
克里斯蒂娜  看看谁来了
Kristina, look who showed up.

670
00:25:28,023 --> 00:25:29,857

Hi, honey, how are you?

673
00:25:32,394 --> 00:25:36,330
看看你

- 你看起来气色不错  - 谢谢
- You look good. - Thank you.

你知道你可以不在场投票的  你真是不要命了
You know you could have voted absentee,you ding-dong.

676
00:25:41,003 --> 00:25:42,704
你不必跑这么大老远来的
You didn't have to come all the way out here.

677
00:25:42,705 --> 00:25:44,505
只能想这一切吗
And miss all this?

678
00:25:44,506 --> 00:25:45,506
没门儿
No way,

679
00:25:45,507 --> 00:25:48,542
没门儿
no way.

680
00:25:48,543 --> 00:25:49,843
我现在很有可能
You know, there's a good chance

681
00:25:49,844 --> 00:25:51,812
会输掉这场竞选  所以...

682
00:25:51,813 --> 00:25:56,049
亲爱爱的  你已经赢了
Honey, you've already won.

683
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:58,051
我真为你而骄傲
I'm so proud of you.

684
00:25:58,052 --> 00:26:00,287
真的
So proud of you.

685
00:26:00,288 --> 00:26:02,422
很感谢你能来
Thank you for coming.

686
00:26:02,423 --> 00:26:04,725
走去投票吧
Let's go vote.

687
00:26:06,828 --> 00:26:10,864
对了  要是我投给小包的话没什么关系吧
Oh, is it a problem that I'm gonna vote for Bob Little?

688
00:26:10,865 --> 00:26:12,933
【笑】
[Laughs]

689
00:26:15,903 --> 00:26:17,437
- 这个办法不错  - 很棒
- That's a great fix. - Great.

690
00:26:17,438 --> 00:26:19,505
那我们接下来要做的就是
And then, so all we need to do then, is we take the plumbing

691
00:26:19,506 --> 00:26:20,773
通向二楼厨房的管道装置了
up through the kitchen to the second floor.

692
00:26:20,774 --> 00:26:22,242
我们还可以加上厕所
And we can just add the toilets

693
00:26:22,243 --> 00:26:23,376
- 之类的  - 对  我们做到了
- and all that stuff... - Yeah, we did it!

694
00:26:23,377 --> 00:26:24,910
- 就在这儿  好了  - 很棒
- Right over there.Done. - Nice

695
00:26:24,911 --> 00:26:27,580
你吃过鳗鱼吗  它太疯狂了  不是吗
Have you tried the eel,cause it's insane,isn't it?

696
00:26:27,581 --> 00:26:29,882
我告诉你  它是从墙里的一个小洞里钻出来的
I'm telling you, it comes from this little hole in the wall.

697
00:26:29,883 --> 00:26:31,851
这是海湾区最好吃的寿司了
It's the best Sushi in the bay area.

698
00:26:31,852 --> 00:26:34,320
所以  要是我们...
So, if we have this--

699
00:26:34,321 --> 00:26:35,988
- 嘿  - 嗨
- Hey. - Hi.

700
00:26:35,989 --> 00:26:37,356
你来这干嘛呢
What are you doing here?

701
00:26:37,357 --> 00:26:38,824
我能跟你谈谈吗
Can I talk to you?

702
00:26:38,825 --> 00:26:40,059
孩子们呢  他们在...
Where are the kids?Are they--

703
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,060
他们在我父母家
they're at my parents'.

704
00:26:41,061 --> 00:26:43,295
请你能跟我聊聊吗
Can I talk to you, please?

705
00:26:43,296 --> 00:26:46,132
- 没什么急事  - 没人流血
- Nothing's an emergency.- Nobody's bleeding,

706
00:26:46,133 --> 00:26:49,168
我想跟你谈谈  而且我跟你都打了五通电话了
but I would like to talk to you,and I've called you five times--

707
00:26:49,169 --> 00:26:51,237
这是我的错  我一直都...
that's my fault,'cause I've been turning--

708
00:26:51,238 --> 00:26:53,272
这跟你无关  皮特
you know,this is not about you, Peet.

709
00:26:53,273 --> 00:26:55,907
- 茱莉亚  - 好吧  我...
- Julia. - Okay, I--

710
00:26:55,908 --> 00:26:57,542
- 茱莉亚  - 我能跟你谈谈吗  请！！！
- Julia. - May I talk to you, please?

711
00:26:57,543 --> 00:26:58,610
不用  你在这儿没关系的
No, no, you're fine.

712
00:26:58,611 --> 00:27:01,112
没关系的  留在这儿
You're fine, please, stay.

713
00:27:01,113 --> 00:27:05,116
茱莉亚  我现在在工作
Julia, I'm working right now,

714
00:27:05,117 --> 00:27:08,820
我们回家再聊这件事
and we will talk about this when I get home.

715
00:27:12,758 --> 00:27:14,692
我倒要看看你到底什么时候能回来
I'll see you whenever that is.

716
00:27:24,974 --> 00:27:28,309
你是说你从来都没参过选
So you're saying you never voted, like, ever.

717
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:31,179
你这样说就太武断了
When you say it like that,it sounds very judgmental.

718
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:33,480
你不觉得应该换个不那么武断的方式来问吗
Do you think you could rephrase it in a less judgmental way?

719
00:27:33,481 --> 00:27:34,615
我不觉得
I don't think I can.

720
00:27:34,616 --> 00:27:36,249
你还有什么比零八年
What more important thing were you doing

721
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:38,151
为奥巴马投上一票更重要  你说啊
other than voting for Barack Obama in 2008, huh?

722
00:27:38,152 --> 00:27:40,887
在选举期间我正在纳帕呢
I was incapacitated in Napa during that election.

723
00:27:40,888 --> 00:27:43,324
在纳帕吗  纳帕  那你哭又是怎么一回事
Oh, Napa? Napa. What happened to crying?

724
00:27:43,325 --> 00:27:44,991
你说你当时哭的像个孩子似的
You know, you said you cried like a baby.

725
00:27:44,992 --> 00:27:47,361
你那天那么激动
You were getting very emotional,

726
00:27:47,362 --> 00:27:49,530
还谈到你祖先之类的事儿
and you were talking about your ancestors and stuff...

727
00:27:49,531 --> 00:27:50,331
我才没有呢
No, I wasn't.

728
00:27:50,332 --> 00:27:52,299
我于是也有点身临其境了
And I got sucked up into it a little bit.

729
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,566
你还谈到了第十五次修正案
You were talking about the 15th Amendment...

730
00:27:53,567 --> 00:27:55,135
- 我没有  - 还有说了公民权利之类的话
- No, I wasn't.- And civil rights stuff.

731
00:27:55,136 --> 00:27:56,636
少废话  住口
Cut the crap.Cut the crap.

732
00:27:56,637 --> 00:27:57,838
你甚至都不为你嫂子投票吗
You wouldn't even vote for your own sister-in-law?

733
00:27:57,839 --> 00:27:59,239
- 你这人到底什么毛病  - 我试过了
- What's wrong with you? - I tried to.

734
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,473
- 那你怎么做的  - 我到那边之后
- How? - I went down there,

735
00:28:00,474 --> 00:28:01,741
他们不让我进去
and they would not let me.

736
00:28:01,742 --> 00:28:03,776
而我现在觉得  因为我们生活在一个民主国家
Now,I was assuming,because we live in a democracy,

737
00:28:03,777 --> 00:28:05,545
我就能在投票当天注册  可是你猜怎么着
that I could register day of,and guess what?

738
00:28:05,546 --> 00:28:06,713
我不能  这又不是我的错
I can't.It's not my fault.

739
00:28:06,714 --> 00:28:08,848
我是一个遵纪守法的好公民  而且我真的已经尽力了
I am an upstanding citizen, and I tried.

740
00:28:08,849 --> 00:28:10,683
要是她以一票之差落败
If she loses by one vote,

741
00:28:10,684 --> 00:28:13,586
就全都怪你
which happens, it's your fault.

742
00:28:24,264 --> 00:28:25,597
嘿  麦克斯
Hey, Max.

743
00:28:25,598 --> 00:28:28,400
我想跟你聊会儿
Let me talk to you for a minute.

744
00:28:28,401 --> 00:28:30,435
聊什么  我现在忙着呢
About what? I'm busy working.

745
00:28:30,436 --> 00:28:31,737
你现在可以不忙工作
You don't got to work right now.

746
00:28:31,738 --> 00:28:33,739
停一小会儿也无妨
Just stop for a second. It's okay.

747
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,407
这是我的地盘  对吧  所以我就是老板
It's my place, right, so I'm the boss.

748
00:28:35,408 --> 00:28:40,479
我就想跟你谈谈露比的事儿
So I just want to talk to you about Ruby for a second.

749
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,880
她已经拒绝我让她当女朋友
She already said she doesn't want

750
00:28:41,881 --> 00:28:43,648
的要求了  所以没什么可谈的
to be my girlfriend,so it's done.

751
00:28:43,649 --> 00:28:45,950
没错  但不是这样的
Yeah, no.

752
00:28:45,951 --> 00:28:50,389
我知道她拒绝你了  但是我想告诉你
I know that.What I wanted to say was

753
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:52,758
想要一个女朋友可不仅仅是
having a girlfriend...It's more than just

754
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:56,395
年龄相仿  兴趣相同就行的
being the same age and liking the same hockey team.

755
00:28:56,396 --> 00:29:00,531
- 不仅仅是这样  - 那是怎样
- It's more than that.- Then what is it about?

756
00:29:00,532 --> 00:29:01,799
对  那又怎样呢
Yeah, what is it about?

757
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:06,371
感情这种事儿啊
It's, um, it's about feeling stuff,

758
00:29:06,372 --> 00:29:09,874
是要由心而发的
you know, like, on the inside.

759
00:29:09,875 --> 00:29:12,076
要让互相心有灵犀
Making a connection, I guess.

760
00:29:12,077 --> 00:29:13,944
让互相快乐
Making each other laugh.

761
00:29:13,945 --> 00:29:17,014
能聊得开
Having conversations.

762
00:29:17,015 --> 00:29:18,883
那要是很难做怎么办
What if it's hard?

763
00:29:18,884 --> 00:29:21,385
聊天很难怎么办
Conversations.

764
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:28,592
相信我  这对每个人来说都不是件易事
Oh, believe me, it's hard for everybody.

765
00:29:28,593 --> 00:29:31,295
不仅是对你而言
Not just you, it's...

766
00:29:31,296 --> 00:29:33,096
要是有人说他们
You know, and screw the people

767
00:29:33,097 --> 00:29:34,464
很容易就做得到
that it comes easy to,

768
00:29:34,465 --> 00:29:36,400
这都是瞎扯淡
'cause that's not real.

769
00:29:36,401 --> 00:29:37,867
听着  你看我  我也是
Look, me, I didn't have

770
00:29:37,868 --> 00:29:41,338
上了大学才交女朋友的
a girlfriend until college,late college.

771
00:29:41,339 --> 00:29:44,107
所以你总有一天也会交到女朋友的
The point is,it's gonna happen for you,Max.

772
00:29:44,108 --> 00:29:46,609
相信我
Trust me.

773
00:29:48,646 --> 00:29:53,883
向我们这样的人  要有点耐心
Guys like us,just got to take time,you know.

774
00:29:53,884 --> 00:29:56,619
对这种事儿不能过于着急
Don't need to rush it.

775
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,254
好吗
Okay?

776
00:29:58,255 --> 00:30:00,557
好吧
Okay.

777
00:30:00,558 --> 00:30:04,193
我现在能继续工作了吗
Can I go back to work now?

778
00:30:04,194 --> 00:30:05,661
当然行
Yeah.

779
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,104
谢了
Thanks.

780
00:30:18,842 --> 00:30:21,543
我该做的  麦克斯
Yeah, sure thing, Max.

781
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:30,519
- 嘿  嘿  嘿  注意了  - 停会儿  有人有话要讲
- Hey, hey, hey, hey. - Here, here, here.

782
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,221
我想告诉你们  我们是史上最好的乐队
I also want to say,here's to the best band ever,

783
00:30:33,222 --> 00:30:34,823
我们一起努力来嗨翻整个摇滚界
and let's make some rock 'n roll history.

784
00:30:34,824 --> 00:30:36,591
我们还有了个乐队新成员呢
Oh, hey, we got a new honorary band mate too.

785
00:30:36,592 --> 00:30:38,559
- 敬她一杯  - 干杯
- To her. - There you go!

786
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,129
对对对  你太棒了
Oh, yeah, yeah, no, you're so good, no.

787
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,098
好吧  好吧
Okay, all right.

788
00:30:43,099 --> 00:30:44,866
- 哇哦   - 说真的
- Whoa. - No, but seriously,

789
00:30:44,867 --> 00:30:47,668
你有天籁一般的嗓音  听起来...
you have the voice of an angel,and it's like...

790
00:30:47,669 --> 00:30:49,471
- 快点  来一个  来一个  - 谢谢  太谢谢了
- Come on,hit me,hit me. - Thank you,thank you.

791
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:51,039
跟我一起唱
Sing it with me.

792
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,641
齐唱：我本该带你回家
Both: I should have taken you home

793
00:30:53,642 --> 00:30:55,476
为什么我唱高音而你却在唱低音呢
Why are you on the bottom and I'm on the top?

794
00:30:55,477 --> 00:30:59,580
好像咱俩唱反了诶
Oh, that's a nice way to slip something pervy in there.

795
00:30:59,581 --> 00:31:00,815
这样不错诶
That was good.

796
00:31:00,816 --> 00:31:02,383
- 这种搭配真不错  - 你们听到了吗
-That was a good combo right there-Did you hear that?

797
00:31:02,384 --> 00:31:03,951
- 我喜欢这样  - 你在说什么呢
- I liked it. - What are you talking about?

798
00:31:03,952 --> 00:31:05,586
别再让他喝了
Don't give him any more.

799
00:31:05,587 --> 00:31:06,587
我说真的
I'm serious.

800
00:31:06,588 --> 00:31:08,155
他已经喝高了
He's in trouble.

801
00:31:08,156 --> 00:31:09,223
等等
Hang on.

802
00:31:09,224 --> 00:31:11,791
【乐队其他成员的聊天声】
[Background chatter]

803
00:31:11,792 --> 00:31:12,959
喂
Hello?

804
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,995
天呐  你去哪儿了
Oh, my God. Where have you been?

805
00:31:14,996 --> 00:31:16,196
我给你打了一遍又一遍的电话
I've been calling and calling.

806
00:31:16,197 --> 00:31:17,864
嗨  对不起  亲爱的
Hi. I'm sorry, babe,

807
00:31:17,865 --> 00:31:19,533
我刚才走神了  我...
I totally spaced out, I'm...

808
00:31:19,534 --> 00:31:20,534
嘿  嘿  等等  安博  安博
Hey, hey, Amber, Amber.

809
00:31:20,535 --> 00:31:21,701
我们今天专辑杀青了
We finished the album today,

810
00:31:21,702 --> 00:31:23,237
我们就到附近的一家酒吧
and I came around the corner,

811
00:31:23,238 --> 00:31:26,272
跟乐队一起庆祝  就来玩一会而已
just to celebrate with the band,

00:31:29,209 --> 00:31:31,210
我们没有看时间  所以我现在也不知道...
We didn't set a time or anything,so I didn't know

815
00:31:31,211 --> 00:31:33,212
你提前下班了  所以我就一直在等你

我能问你一个简短的问题吗
Can I just ask you a quick question?

836
00:32:09,148 --> 00:32:10,749
我就耽搁你一秒钟来帮我一下
I just need your guidance for one second.

837
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:11,750
你能帮我吗

Have you thought about Kristina Braverman?

844
00:32:24,464 --> 00:32:27,132
- 哦  拜托  - 你到底不喜欢她哪点
- Oh, come on.- What don't you like about her?

845
00:32:27,133 --> 00:32:29,234
什么  她见人就抱
What? She hugs everybody she meets.

846
00:32:29,235 --> 00:32:31,603
她电话号码给了几乎她见过的一半人
She gets phone numbers from half the people she meets.

847
00:32:31,604 --> 00:32:34,438
要是她寂寞的话  就该去约会
If she's lonely, she should go on a date.

848
00:32:34,439 --> 00:32:38,776
不  她不能  因为她还有个暴力的老公
No, she can't. She got the violent husband.

849

对  他确实是可能有那个倾向
Yeah, he's a liability.

嘘  别这样
Shh, come on.

你会得到两张票
You're getting two votes.

860
00:33:04,902 --> 00:33:08,005
加一张给布雷弗曼的  减去一张给小鲍的
Plus one for Braverman.Minus one for Bob Little.

861
00:33:08,006 --> 00:33:09,773
帮你投一张  我自己一张  加起来就两张

862
00:33:09,774 --> 00:33:13,910
两票40美元

我给你40美元
I'm gonna give you the 40 bucks,

866
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:20,017
但你得给我搞一张贴纸来

867
00:33:20,018 --> 00:33:21,151
- 成交  - 好吧
- Done. - All right.

868
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:22,685
别忘了贴纸  布雷弗曼的
Don't forget the sticker.Braverman.

869
00:33:22,686 --> 00:33:24,820
要是你向他们要的话  他们也会给你的
They'll give you a sticker if you just ask them.

870
00:33:24,821 --> 00:33:26,589

你还好吗
You all right?

00:33:52,448 --> 00:33:54,383
我跟瑞恩闹矛盾了

Look,I think that it's probably not your fault.

889
00:34:02,392 --> 00:34:03,992
你在跟乐队一起录专辑
You're recording on an album with a band.

你会玩的非常开心的

我觉得就是想好了
Plotting and planning left and right.

916
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:03,205
在图纸上画上几笔

917
00:35:03,206 --> 00:35:04,406
【狂笑中】
[Laughter]

918
00:35:04,407 --> 00:35:05,941
我知道德鲁会会有你这样一个
I knew drew was gonna have this, like,

919
00:35:05,942 --> 00:35:07,475
又年轻又漂亮的老妈

924
00:35:18,054 --> 00:35:19,988
我们只是朋友而已

- 非常普通  - 对

928
00:35:25,561 --> 00:35:28,262
普通朋友  对  当然的啦
Casual, yeah, sure.

929
00:35:28,263 --> 00:35:29,397
那就继续普通下去吧
Keeping it casual.

930
00:35:29,398 --> 00:35:30,965
百分之八十的选票已经被统计出来了
80% of votes have been counted,

931
00:35:30,966 --> 00:35:32,133
我们领先了七千票

932
00:35:32,134 --> 00:35:33,568
- 不错嘛  - 太棒了
- Good. - Great.

933
00:35:33,569 --> 00:35:35,503
但是小鲍的选区票数还没统计出来
But Bob Little's districts haven't come in yet.

934
00:35:35,504 --> 00:35:37,204
- 哦  - 你是谁
- Oh. - Who are you?

935

这是娜塔莉  她是我的...
This is Natalie. She's my--

936
00:35:38,641 --> 00:35:39,807
你们是男女朋友关系吗

937
00:35:39,808 --> 00:35:42,043
- 不  我们就是朋友而已  - 嗯  不是
- No, we're just friends. - Um, no.

938
00:35:42,044 --> 00:35:43,677
我才邀请我的第一个女孩一起约会呢
I just asked my first girl out.

939
00:35:43,678 --> 00:35:44,811
- 不错  做得好  - 不错
- Nice! Good work. - Nice.

940
00:35:44,812 --> 00:35:46,580
- 但是她拒绝了我  - 那是她的损失
- But then she said no.- Well, her loss.

941
00:35:46,581 --> 00:35:48,949
- 她住在明尼苏达  - 对
- She lives in Minnesota anyway.- Yeah.

942
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:51,218
但很明显异地恋太糟糕了
And apparently long-distance relationships are hell.

943
00:35:51,219 --> 00:35:52,286
确实是
That's true.

944
00:35:52,287 --> 00:35:54,922
好吧  待会儿再聊
All right.Talk to you later.

945
00:35:54,923 --> 00:35:56,890
我没觉得有什么问题啊
I don't see what the problem is.

946
00:35:56,891 --> 00:35:58,559
你买了张选票
You bought a vote?

947
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,960
你说得没错  我买了张选票
You're damn right, I bought a vote.

948
00:35:59,961 --> 00:36:01,327
要是她一票的优势获胜
If she wins by one vote,

949
00:36:01,328 --> 00:36:03,263
这将会是我花过最有价值的40美元
that's gonna be the best $40 dollars I ever spent.

950
00:36:03,264 --> 00:36:04,565
你不能那样做
You can't do that.

951
00:36:04,566 --> 00:36:06,433
你又怎么知道他原先不是打算投给克里斯蒂娜的呢
How are you so sure he even voted for Kristina?

952
00:36:06,434 --> 00:36:07,901
- 你什么时候变得那么喜欢挖苦人了  - 你不能买选票
- When did you become such a cynic? - You can't buy a vote.

953
00:36:07,902 --> 00:36:10,771
我看过那家伙的眼睛  他值得我信任
I saw in this man's eyes he was a trustworthy man.

954
00:36:10,772 --> 00:36:12,005
- 真的吗  - 天呐
- Oh, really? - Oh, my goodness.

955
00:36:12,006 --> 00:36:13,139
他卖了自己的选票
I mean, he sold his vote,

956
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,474
但他值得信任  就是这样
but he was very trustworthy,other than that.

957
00:36:14,475 --> 00:36:15,608
我们的谈一谈
We need to talk.

958
00:36:15,609 --> 00:36:16,909
我甚至敢把艾达托付给他
I would have trusted him with Aida--

959
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:18,244
- 嘿  乔  - 嘿  大家好
- hey, Joel.- Hey, guys.

960
00:36:18,245 --> 00:36:20,046
- 你还好吗  - 去去就回
- How's it going? - We'll be right back.

961
00:36:21,782 --> 00:36:25,585
那个三明治是几号
What number sandwich is that?

962
00:36:25,586 --> 00:36:27,520
三根手指意味着是五号
Three means five, doesn't it?

963
00:36:27,521 --> 00:36:29,289
我一直在努力处理维克多的事儿
I was trying to deal with Victor,

964
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:30,290
他最近一直很沮丧
and he's so upset.

965
00:36:30,291 --> 00:36:31,558
- 嗯  - 他非常沮丧  而且...
- Yes. - He is so upset and--

966
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:32,625
这不是你想扮演的角色吗
that's the position you wanted to be in.

967
00:36:32,626 --> 00:36:33,793
我感觉你没有关心他
I feel like you're not there.

968
00:36:33,794 --> 00:36:34,927
我没有关心维克多吗
I'm not there for Victor?

969
00:36:34,928 --> 00:36:36,328
我感觉你根本一点都不顾家
I feel like you're not even there.

970
00:36:36,329 --> 00:36:37,930
我很关心他  也很关心西德妮
I am there for him.I am there for Sydney.

971
00:36:37,931 --> 00:36:39,065
你到底想干嘛
What more do you want?

972
00:36:39,066 --> 00:36:40,766
那我呢  我现在需要你
What about me?I needed you in that moment.

973
00:36:40,767 --> 00:36:42,534
- 你吗  - 我觉得我快被淹死了
- What about you?- I felt like I was drowning,

974
00:36:42,535 --> 00:36:44,103
而且我还抓不到你的手
and I could not get a hold of you,

975
00:36:44,104 --> 00:36:46,305
而你却随随便便地吃着寿司晚餐
and you're just having casual sushi dinner.

976
00:36:46,306 --> 00:36:48,340
你怎么能这样对我
How could you do that to me?

977
00:36:48,341 --> 00:36:49,808
- 你怎么能这样对我  - 我不知道...
- How could you do that to me?- I don't know...

978
00:36:49,809 --> 00:36:50,942
我根本就感觉不到你
I could not get a hold of you.

979
00:36:50,943 --> 00:36:52,744
我从不会闯进你在莱昂・邓格拉夫
I never would have walked into your office

980
00:36:52,745 --> 00:36:54,679
公司的办公室  也不会跟他那样讲话
with Leon Dengraff and talked to him that way.

981
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,081
我从不会对他这样做
I never would have done that to him.

982
00:36:56,082 --> 00:36:57,082
我也从没有这样对你过
I never would have done that to you.

983
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:58,250
乔  这无关乎于工作
Joel,this is not about the work.

984
00:36:58,251 --> 00:36:59,384
我绝对不会这样对他
I never would have treated him that way.

985
00:36:59,385 --> 00:37:00,952
也绝不会这样对你
I never would have treated you that way.

986
00:37:00,953 --> 00:37:04,189
那样可能会害我丢掉饭碗的  茱莉亚
That could have cost me my job,Julia.

987
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:05,857
- 乔  这是关于...  - 九年了
- Joel, this is about...- Nine years.

988
00:37:05,858 --> 00:37:07,525
- 我给了你九年时间   - 维克多
- I give you nine years. - Victor.

989
00:37:07,526 --> 00:37:09,628
我拥护了你九年
I championed you for nine years,

990
00:37:09,629 --> 00:37:11,129
而你却不肯给我...
and you can't give me--

991
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:12,497
连三个月都不肯给我吗
you can't give me three months.

992
00:37:12,498 --> 00:37:13,832
这与工作无关
This is not about the work.

993
00:37:13,833 --> 00:37:15,299
无关吗
It's not?

994
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,602
这是关于我们家现在爆发的家庭危机
This is about a family crisis that is happening right now.

995
00:37:17,603 --> 00:37:19,370
你工作的时候就跟工作有关
It was about the work when you were working.

996
00:37:19,371 --> 00:37:21,072
你工作的时候就跟工作有关
It was about the work when you were working,

997
00:37:21,073 --> 00:37:22,640
而我就一直默默在你背后支持着你
and I was there for you.I supported you.

998
00:37:22,641 --> 00:37:24,342
当时我们也没遇到过现在这种事啊
We never went through anything like this.

999
00:37:24,343 --> 00:37:25,943
我一直看着你所做的证词
I looked over every deposition you had.

1000
00:37:25,944 --> 00:37:29,547
我一直拥护着你的每一次尝试  每一次啊 茱莉亚
I was there to champion every trial, every trial, Julia.

1001
00:37:29,548 --> 00:37:32,683
我也跟你一起在分享着这个项目的喜悦  乔
I'm sharing in your joy on this project,Joel.

1002
00:37:32,684 --> 00:37:34,084
好极了  还真是表现出来了
Great, it really shows.

1003
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,586
但我们正经历着家庭危机
But we're going through a family crisis right now.

1004
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:36,820
好吧  好吧
Okay, okay, well--

1005
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:38,455
而我觉得你根本就不关心
and I feel like you're not there.

1006
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:39,456
我会去关心的
Well, I'll be there.

1007
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:40,924
我马上就去解决这事儿
I'll go solve it right now.

1008
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:45,595
告诉克里斯蒂娜我很抱歉不能在这儿陪你
Tell Kristina I'm sorry I couldn't be here for you

1009
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:47,597
也不能陪我们的孩子
and there for our children.

1010
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:55,004
天呐
God.

1011
00:37:55,005 --> 00:37:56,373
好吧  最新战况如何
Okay, so what is the latest?

1012
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:57,774
我们得挺住了
You know,we're hanging in there.

1013
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,008
我们有一点落后
You know, we're down a bit,

1014
00:37:59,009 --> 00:38:00,443
- 但票数非常接近  所以...  - 好吧
- but it's close, so... - Okay.

1015
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,345
就看四区的情况如何了
Just waiting for district four to come in.

1016
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:04,113
四区可是小鲍的王国啊
District four,that's Bob little country.

1017
00:38:04,114 --> 00:38:05,848
对  但是最近你的支持率在那边也有所上升
Yeah,but your numbers have been getting better there.

1018
00:38:05,849 --> 00:38:08,618
四区什么时候才会弄完
When do we expect the districtfour numbers to come in?

1019
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:09,719
随时都有可能
You know, any minute.

1020
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,620
- 准备好你的演讲吗  - 当然准备好了
- You got your speeches? - Yes, I do.

1021
00:38:11,621 --> 00:38:13,422
不论胜败  都准备好了
I've got the winning and I've got the losing.

1022
00:38:13,423 --> 00:38:14,891
海瑟  你的本能告诉你了什么
Heather, what does your gut tell you?

1023
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:16,659
我的本能告诉我  胜利在即
You know,my gut tells me that it's close.

1024
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,327
那样说对我也没什么帮助现在
Well, that is not helping me right now.

1025
00:38:18,328 --> 00:38:20,997
好吧  听着 克里斯蒂娜  去豪饮两杯
All right, look, Kristina,get some booze.

1026
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:23,132
这样会让你冷静点
You know, it'll calm your nerves.

1027
00:38:23,133 --> 00:38:25,668
反正不管如何你都得要喝的
You're gonna need it either way.

1028
00:38:25,669 --> 00:38:31,740
听着  不论结果如何  你都做得非常棒
And, look, hey, either way, you did great.

1029
00:38:31,741 --> 00:38:35,411
真的
Really.

1030
00:38:35,412 --> 00:38:37,580
- 我们要输了  - 嘿  别这样想
- We're gonna lose. - Hey.

1031
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:39,181
你刚才没看到她的表情吗
Did you see that look on her face?

1032
00:38:39,182 --> 00:38:40,549
亲爱的  我们输定了
Honey, we're going down.

1033
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:43,319
我觉着她可能是有点消化不良而已
I just think--I think she has a little indigestion.

1034
00:38:46,255 --> 00:38:47,488
好吗
All right?

1035
00:38:47,489 --> 00:38:48,556
别想太多  好吗
Don't read too much into this stuff, okay?

1036
00:38:48,557 --> 00:38:50,291
- 我实在是太紧张了  - 我知道
- I'm just nervous. - I know.

1037
00:38:50,292 --> 00:38:52,393
我去给你弄杯喝的  好吗
Let me get you that drink, all right?

1038
00:38:52,394 --> 00:38:53,595
好吧  亲爱的
Okay, honey?

1039
00:38:53,596 --> 00:38:54,596
嗯
Mm.

1040
00:38:54,597 --> 00:38:55,831
好吗
Okay?

1041
00:39:14,617 --> 00:39:16,884
谢谢  谢谢
Thank you.Thank you.

1042
00:39:26,527 --> 00:39:27,828
非常感谢
Thank you all so very much.

1043
00:39:27,829 --> 00:39:30,998
我刚才接到小鲍的电话
I just got off the phone with Bob Little,

1044
00:39:30,999 --> 00:39:33,600
我没能赢他
and I conceded the election to him.

1045
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:36,370
我失败了
It's a bummer.

1046
00:39:36,371 --> 00:39:39,539
票数非常接近了  但他确实竞选得非常棒
It was very close, but he ran a great race,

1047
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:43,277
我觉得他一定会成为一个非常优秀的市长的
and I think that Bob is going to make an incredible mayor.

1048
00:39:43,278 --> 00:39:46,713
我想借此机会感谢各位
I just want to take this opportunity to say thank you

1049
00:39:46,714 --> 00:39:49,283
感谢你们在这整场竞选中
so much all of you that have supported me

1050
00:39:49,284 --> 00:39:50,650
这么支持我
throughout this campaign,

1051
00:39:50,651 --> 00:39:54,821
我是打心底感激你们
and I mean that from the bottom of my heart.

1052
00:39:54,822 --> 00:39:57,257
你们中或许有人不知道
You know,some of you might not know this,

1053
00:39:57,258 --> 00:39:59,659
一年之前
but a year ago,

1054
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:04,497
我从未想过会站在这个舞台
I thought I might not even be here today,

1055
00:40:04,498 --> 00:40:06,599
我这样说一点也没有夸大其词
and I'm not exaggerating when I say that.

1056
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:10,969
我真没有预料到事情会朝什么方向发展
I really didn't know which way things were going to turn out.

1057
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:13,138
我只想告诉你们
And I just want to say how grateful

1058
00:40:13,139 --> 00:40:16,108
我能在这儿有多感激大家
I am that I actually am here,and with

1059
00:40:16,109 --> 00:40:19,478
有了你们的帮助  我才能实现
your help I'm able to fulfill a dream of mine

1060
00:40:19,479 --> 00:40:21,480
我曾经连想都不敢想的事儿
that I never thought possible.

1061
00:40:21,481 --> 00:40:23,548
我只想感谢你们所有的人
All of you, I just thank you,

1062
00:40:23,549 --> 00:40:25,583
而且我真的还想继续与你们保持联系
and I really want to stay in touch with you.

1063
00:40:25,584 --> 00:40:27,686
你们大部分人都有我的电话号码
Most of you have my cell phone number...

1064
00:40:28,721 --> 00:40:29,754
这样很好
Which is good.

1065
00:40:29,755 --> 00:40:30,755
祝你们今晚玩得愉快
Have a wonderful night,

1066
00:40:30,756 --> 00:40:31,756
我爱你们大家
and I love you all.

1067
00:40:31,757 --> 00:40:32,891
非常感谢
Thank you.

1068
00:40:32,892 --> 00:40:35,593
【欢呼与鼓掌声】
[Cheers and applause]

1069
00:40:38,998 --> 00:40:40,498
做得好
Good job.

1070
00:40:48,574 --> 00:40:51,676
嗨
Hi.

1071
00:40:51,677 --> 00:40:53,745
我真为你骄傲
I'm proud of you.

1072
00:40:53,746 --> 00:40:55,279
你做到了
You kicked butt.

1073
00:40:57,816 --> 00:40:59,717
嗨  我是辩论赛上那个卡洛琳・李
Hi, it's Caroline Lee from the debate.

1074
00:40:59,718 --> 00:41:00,718
- 你还好吗  - 很好
- How are you? - Good.

1075
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:01,752
能见到你真是太高兴了
So nice to see you.

1076
00:41:01,753 --> 00:41:02,753
很高兴见到你
