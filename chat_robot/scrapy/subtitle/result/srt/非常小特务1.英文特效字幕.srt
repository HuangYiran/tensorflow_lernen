00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}An enormous amount of turmoil between countries.

00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Those men and women were spies.

36
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They were masters of disguise.

37
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:16,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They could sense danger a mile away...

38
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and through their work...

00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}were other spies...

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}enemy spies.

43
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So,sometimes,one spy's mission...

44
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:40,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}was to make the enemy disappear.

45
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:45,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was the assignment that changed her life...

00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:48,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but when the moment finally came to carry out her mission...

47
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}she couldn't do it.

48
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was different than she expected.

49
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:07,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sure,he was charming and intelligent...

50
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but he was unexpectedly honorable...

51
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and it made her realize...

52
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}how years of working with detached emotion...

53
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:19,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}had taken its toll.

54
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:21,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So they kept contact...

55
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:25,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}through lunch dates... very discreet.

56
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After all,they were on different sides...

57
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so they could never be seen together.

58
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dinner dates followed...

59
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}wherever their mutual travels took them.

60
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And they fell in love...

61
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and they decided that,together they would embark...

62
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}on the most dangerous mission of all time.

63
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

64
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They decided to marry.

65
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow.

66

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}she felt like she would rather brave a thousand deadly missions...

68
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}than go through with what she was about to attempt.

69
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why is that?

70
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,marriage is a mission so complex...

71
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:03,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that only the most courageous and slightly insane need apply.

72
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:05,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's such an amazing series of obstacles...

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}one has to navigate to keep a marriage together much less family

74
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:11,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that it frightened even her...

75
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:14,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a hardened and experienced secret agent.

76
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But when she saw him...

77
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}standing there with no doubt whatsoever...

00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so enamored with what they were about to do...

80
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}she took his hand...

81

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}looked deep into his eyes...

82
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and said the two most dangerous...

00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}most trusting words you can say to anyone.

84
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

85
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She said,"I do. "

86
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:43,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,that's so cool.

87
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Then the problems started.

88
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now,there was always some faction...

89
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that wanted at least one of them gone.

90
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}On their own,each agent was notorious...

91
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but together,they made tempting targets.

92
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So,they retired...

93
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}settled down...

94

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}had a few kids.

95
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:50,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In a way,they exchanged...

96
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}one life of adventure for another trading espionage for parenthood

97
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:57,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a mysterious and compelling mission in its own right.

98
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:01,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And they're better off. The end.

99

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No "happily ever after"?

100

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I said they were better off.

101
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:08,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great story,Mom,but it needs a new ending.

102
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It needs monsters.

103
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that right?

104
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you want me to look at your...

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I put the medicine on.

106
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:19,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK,munchkin. Good night.

107

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What was the story tonight?

108

00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How many nights,I wonder...

110
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}do you send the children off to bed with nightmares?

111
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Carmen asked for the story.

112
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That life is over now.

113
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are consultants,not spies.

114
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I went to their school today.

115
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Had that meeting with the principal.

116
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:05,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Carmen's been skipping school twice a month.

117
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Why? - I don't know.

118
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:10,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And those school friends Juni talks about having?

119
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Diego somebody and Renaldo?

120
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No such beasts.

121
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It turns out,the other kids pick on him.

122
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He has no friends.

123
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It doesn't help that he has his head in the clouds...

124
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}making these weird drawings...

125
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:26,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and burying himself into that demented kids show.

126
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:30,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're keeping secrets from us,Gregorio...

127
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I think it's our fault.

128
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They've gotten this from us.

129
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:36,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have good reason to keep secrets.

130
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:39,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If we told them we were spies...

131
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:42,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they'd have visions of danger every time we leave the house.

132
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:48,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Speaking of secrets...

133
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:50,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}what are you working on over here?

134
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:54,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,nothing important.

135
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just...

136
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:09,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why do we have to do this every morning?

137
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We already have P.E. at school.

138
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:19,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You gonna hang there all day,scaredy cat?

00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Told you not to look down.

140
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't help it. I'm slipping.

141
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's your butterfingers that are slipping.

142
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uhh ! Hurry up!

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll see about that.

149

00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is this what you were hiding last night?

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Year after year we pay outrageous sums of money to several inventors

209
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:34,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to come up with our technologies.

210
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Floop is one such visionary.

211
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}However,his inventions are somewhat questionable...

212
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and,therefore,need to be evaluated.

213
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You promised us an army,Mr. Floop...

214
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:49,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but our first billion dollars bought us only this...

215
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}mutated secret agents.

216
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The mutative process and brain wipe...

217
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:57,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}caused their minds to turn to mush.

218
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:00,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have found little use for them except as novelties on my...

219
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:05,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}well,my children's show,currently rated number two?

220
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Number two.

221
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the devil are these finger men?

222
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh. They're called Thumb-thumbs.

223
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Very capable robots.

224
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All thumbs. Useless.

225
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:22,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Lisp,I think you'll enjoy this.

226
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Through that door,an awesome power will emerge.

227
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You will have but a moment to disarm it.

228
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:34,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In exactly ten seconds.

229
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Seven...

00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Five...

00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:43,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Three...

00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:52,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Johnny?

233
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:05,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You hesitated. - I had to. He's my son.

234
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you sure?

235
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Actually,I designed him.

236
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:11,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I built him !

237
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His name is...

238
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:18,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}X-5-2-4-9-5,the second.

239
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is your big idea?

240
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:23,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Robot kids that look like my children.

241
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The president's daughter?

242
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:32,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}An almost-exact replica.

243
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:36,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sometimes in order to think big...

244
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you have to think small.

245
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Through physio-electrical imaging...

246
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can make them look like anyone...

247
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:44,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}yet the cunning and intelligence...

248
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}of the world's greatest espionage agents...

249
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:52,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}all rolled into tiny packages I call "Spy Kids."

250

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell me,Spy Kids with your vast stores of knowledge...

251
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}what are four of the five physiological indications...

252
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:04,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that a human being is lying?

253
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:08,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're not quite finished.

254
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Missing one crucial element.

255
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Missing what?

256
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Their brains.

257
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:20,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These buckets of bolts will never pass as children !

258
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:21,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have a schedule to keep,Floop...

259
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:25,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a window of opportunity that's closing fast!

260
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We will be back in two days to pick up our army...

261
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:32,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or we'll take whatever you do have,cut our losses...

262
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:35,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and lay your entire silly empire to waste!

263
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:37,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No more time.

264
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:44,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Escort Mr. Lisp back to his chopper,children.

265
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:51,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That was brilliant,sir. - Thank you,Minion.

266
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now all I have to do is make them work for real.

267
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You're going where? - On assignment.

268
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Several OSS agents are missing,including Donnagon.

269
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:09,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No ransom,no demands. They just disappeared.

270
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:13,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After nine years,you are accepting an assignment?

271
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Why? - In a word,Devlin.

272
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Devlin himself called?

273
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He called,asked me to go in.

274
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going with you.

275
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:27,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ingrid,you're always looking to go on another mission...

276
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but we have children now.

277
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can't both leave.

278
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:33,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want to go on an adventure. I want to save the world.

279
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Again? Honey,it's old.

280
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:39,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If it wasn't for Donnagon and the other agents...

281
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I would be turning this mission down myself.

282
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean,clearly.

283
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:46,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're gonna turn me down?

284
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Me?

285
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Spy boy.

00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:00,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What...what about the children?

288

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey,churros,how are you?

290
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Last time I saw you,you were this big.

291
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're shrinking. What's up?

292

00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:14,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what families are for. That's what I hear,anyway.

295
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do I know you?

296

00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:30,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why don't we call them?

309

724
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:17,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So,this must be Machete.

725
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're getting help from Dad's best man?

00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:33,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you working on?

727
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:35,510

00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:38,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't see it.

729
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah,but it sees you.

730
00:51:42,190 --> 00:51:43,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You sell counterintelligence stuff here?

731
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:46,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Come back with your parents. - We can't.

732
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:51,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We need something fast that can get us here.

733
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who are you?

734
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:57,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Carmen Elizabeth Juanita Costa-Brava Cortez.

735
00:51:59,910 --> 00:52:02,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gregorio Cortez is our father.

736
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:04,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were at his wedding.

737
00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:10,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You will turn around. You will leave my shop.

738
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:12,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because I never want to hear my brother's name again.

739

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're our uncle?

740
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:18,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our real uncle? 'Cause we already got a fake uncle.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gregorio Cortez is my younger brother.

00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,good.

745

00:52:41,290 --> 00:52:43,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're all here as planned.

748
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:47,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have to get back to my show now.

749
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:50,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You must focus on the task at hand.

750
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:54,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have to prepare the army before Mr. Lisp arrives.

751
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:56,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't believe in this anymore,Minion.

752
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think I ever did.

753
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Explain.

754
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:03,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The mutated agents,the robot kids.

755
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:06,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Those aren't my ideas. They're yours.

756
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:07,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So what?

757
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:10,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think that's why they're not working.

758
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:12,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not yet they're not.

759
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:18,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But,you see...I now have the Third Brain.

760
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:20,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't need you anymore.

761
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Minion?

762
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I assure you,it's Mr. Minion now.

763
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:34,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you,Floop,have served your purpose.

764
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:35,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Children...

765
00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:39,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}lock him in the...virtual room.

766
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're a secret agent,aren't you?

767
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:46,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What makes you say that?

768
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:49,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}According to the database,you're always traveling...

769
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:51,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and no one knows what you do for a living.

770
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:54,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think we all have uncles like that.

771
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:57,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Another fine Machete product."

772
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:02,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You make the best spy inventions in the world.

773
00:54:02,410 --> 00:54:03,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's correct.

774
00:54:03,790 --> 00:54:06,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you sell them to both sides,good and bad.

775
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:09,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's why Dad hasn't spoken of you in all these years.

776
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:12,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ever sell stuff to Floop?

777
00:54:14,130 --> 00:54:15,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why?

778
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:16,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our Mom and Dad...

779
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:18,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}your brother... are his prisoners...

780
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:20,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and if we don't do something to help...

781
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:23,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}something really bad's gonna happen to them.

782
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't see why you won't help him !

783
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:27,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think I want to baby-sit my brother the rest of my life?

784
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:29,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Watch out for Gregorio. Take care of Gregorio.

00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:31,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Make sure Gregorio knows right from wrong."

786
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:36,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Machete's not responsible for nobody but Machete.

787
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:39,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But that's not what family is.

788
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:42,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're just brothers. Cain and Abel were brothers.

789
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:44,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look how they ended up.

790
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:51,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now,the only thing that will get you to Floop's castle fast enough

791
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:53,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is this.

792
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:54,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's tiny.

793
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:57,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's built for one passenger,but it's fast.

794
00:54:57,550 --> 00:54:59,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will you go?

795
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:00,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

798
00:55:07,770 --> 00:55:08,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

800
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:20,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pass the pig intestines.

801
00:55:24,370 --> 00:55:26,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not eating that now. Nope.

802
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Can I have a... - No!

803

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Glass of water?

804
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:34,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you for letting us stay here...

805
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:37,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}while we ponder our parents' terrible fate.

806
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:40,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you weren't a Cortez,I wouldn't be doing this much.

807
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So family does mean more to you than money.

808
00:55:45,890 --> 00:55:47,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

810
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:00,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ready?

811
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:02,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go.

812
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:09,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now we're talkin'.

813
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:16,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing?

814
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:18,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Getting the map to Floop's castle.

815
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:23,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shh. It's just a reflex.

816

00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:54,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What can I do to help?

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good-bye,Uncle Machete!

827
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks for the plane!

828
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:48,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK,so here's the new plan.

829
00:57:49,010 --> 00:57:50,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We get to the castle,rescue Mom and Dad...

830
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:51,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then somehow stop Floop...

831
00:57:51,890 --> 00:57:53,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}from using the brain on the robots...

832
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:56,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}before they're sent out to dominate the world.

833
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:59,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Think we can do that? - How hard could it be?

834
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:04,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't do anything.

835
00:58:04,990 --> 00:58:09,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK. Airspeed...fine. Altitude...fine.

836
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:11,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Autopilot...failing?

837
00:58:11,910 --> 00:58:15,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,great. Another fine Machete product.

838
00:58:15,290 --> 00:58:17,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take control. We have to go to manual.

839
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:19,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now!

840
00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:22,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were supposed to read all the instructions!

841
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:26,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You skipped a chapter,meathead.

842
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:28,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Better stop calling me names.

843
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pull up,booger breath !

844
00:58:30,430 --> 00:58:32,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop it or I'll call you names.

845
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:34,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go ahead. You got nothin' on me,warthog.

846
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:39,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Try me...diaper lady.

847
00:58:40,810 --> 00:58:43,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aha. Hope you're wearing one now.

848
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:46,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- How long have you known? - Since forever.

849
00:58:46,990 --> 00:58:49,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom made me swear not to mention it.

850
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:52,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So now we're even !

851
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,now you've done it!

852
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:57,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I knew this was gonna happen !

853
00:58:57,830 --> 00:59:00,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're gonna crash if you don't do something !

854
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:05,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You did that on purpose,you kamikaze!

855
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:08,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But now it's balanced!

856
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:09,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Landing gear.

857
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:14,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No landing gear. We're gonna crash !

858
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:17,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nope. We're gonna drop.

859
00:59:17,970 --> 00:59:19,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get your regulator ready.

860
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:40,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Com systems check. Can you hear me?

861
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:41,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

862
00:59:41,290 --> 00:59:45,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's try that cave over there.

863
00:59:45,510 --> 00:59:46,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This must be in.

864
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:48,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are kiding me.

865
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:50,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a cave of sleeping sharks.

866
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sharks don't sleep on a bed.

867
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:55,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I did a science project,

868
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:59,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Its depth the water salinization is just right,they gather to sleep.

869
00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:01,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And garding the way.

870
01:00:01,870 --> 01:00:02,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It looks like the door over there.

871
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:06,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Whoa cool - don't touch it.

872
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Isn't the man either?

873
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:12,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,you're not a man yet,you might think it's a oversized.

874
01:00:12,930 --> 01:00:13,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop,going you up.

875
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:16,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey,little sleeping shark.

876
01:00:19,910 --> 01:00:21,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It sleeps,silly.

877
01:00:22,470 --> 01:00:23,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I knew that.

878
01:00:23,930 --> 01:00:27,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Come on. - Cweet dream sharks.

879
01:00:35,620 --> 01:00:38,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A surveilance camera. I'm gonna destruct it,you wait here.

880
01:00:39,410 --> 01:00:41,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Don't leave me.- Wait here.

881
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Say cheese

882
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:55,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hope there's a restaurant around here.

883
01:00:56,730 --> 01:00:57,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I take a picture of the door.

884
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:00,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In place in front of the surveilance camera,

885
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:02,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So they can't see us go inside

886
01:01:02,890 --> 01:01:05,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I gotta go pee,and I cann't hold it.

887
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:09,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't pee,you will change the water salinization and wake up all the sharks.

888
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:12,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I cann't help it.All this...another

889
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:18,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know,another camera planting straight at me,what'd I do?

890
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:28,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why aren't you watching the monitors?

891
01:01:34,650 --> 01:01:35,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}get the more securities of here

892
01:01:58,390 --> 01:02:00,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh.I can't hold it anymore.

893

894
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:12,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait a second Juni,keep coding it

895

929
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the ventilator shaft here.

930
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:42,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But the dungeon's on the other side of the castle.

931
01:05:42,670 --> 01:05:45,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do we get there undetected?

932
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:00,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think they've gotten smarter since the last time we met.

933
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:01,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Intruder.

934
01:06:13,910 --> 01:06:16,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Can you make it? - I think so.

935
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:18,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. Come on !

936
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:23,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Carmen ! - Find Mom and Dad !

937
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:35,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hope this leads to the dungeon.

938
01:06:44,030 --> 01:06:45,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You there.

939
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:49,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's that on your hands?

940
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:55,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Warts,aren't they?

941
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:56,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,great.

942
01:06:56,750 --> 01:06:59,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}From sweaty hands sprout warts.

943
01:06:59,870 --> 01:07:02,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you know why you have sweaty hands?

944
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:05,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}From being scared all the time.

945
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:09,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't look very scared to me.

946
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:13,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's because I'm mad. You kidnapped my parents...

947
01:07:13,470 --> 01:07:17,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}made psycho robot children,and swallowed up my sister.

948
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I didn't want any of that.

949
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:23,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I thought Floop was a genius. - You did?

950
01:07:27,820 --> 01:07:30,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You watch my show?

951
01:07:30,070 --> 01:07:31,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}More than you know.

952
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:38,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alexander Minion.

953
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:40,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Agent Cortez.

954
01:07:40,250 --> 01:07:42,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wonderful to see you again.

955
01:07:42,250 --> 01:07:44,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You know him? - Yeah.

956
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:46,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was on the Third Brain Project...

957
01:07:47,050 --> 01:07:52,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}until I noticed he was trying to inject his own ideas into the system.

958
01:07:52,340 --> 01:07:54,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I turned him in.

959
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:56,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was thrown out of the OSS.

960
01:07:56,680 --> 01:08:00,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm afraid I'm not nearly the artist Floop is.

961
01:08:00,850 --> 01:08:02,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But not to worry.

962
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:05,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have something else in mind.

963
01:08:08,940 --> 01:08:11,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you think you're going to accomplish by doing this?

964
01:08:11,650 --> 01:08:13,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,you see,Mrs. Cortez...

965
01:08:13,410 --> 01:08:16,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've always been methodical,goal oriented.

966
01:08:16,830 --> 01:08:18,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Psychotically so.

967
01:08:18,290 --> 01:08:20,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not afraid of you,Alex.

968
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:22,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I think it's refreshing...

969
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:25,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to every once in a while...

970
01:08:25,790 --> 01:08:28,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}have some fun.

971
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:29,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,and don't worry about your little brats.

972
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:31,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They'll still be able to see you.

973
01:08:32,010 --> 01:08:35,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Every weekday morning between 7:30 and 8:00.

974
01:09:07,790 --> 01:09:11,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I trust this time Floop will have a success to show us.

975
01:09:11,170 --> 01:09:14,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Fabulous Floop is away on other business,sir.

976
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:16,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your army is complete.

977
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:19,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The ultimate destructive force is now within your grasp.

978
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:22,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll believe that when I see it.

979
01:09:26,810 --> 01:09:29,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Welcome back,Ms. Gradenko.

980
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:34,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's good to be back,Alex.

981
01:09:34,150 --> 01:09:36,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's never have children.

982
01:09:36,110 --> 01:09:39,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- So Minion is the evil one. - Yes.

983
01:09:39,950 --> 01:09:41,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I will be blamed.

984
01:09:41,950 --> 01:09:43,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have every reason to be disappointed in me.

985
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:48,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So what would you do if you could shut this thing off and get out of here?

986
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:51,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's impossible. It can only be turned off from the outside.

987
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:53,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just suppose.

988
01:09:53,970 --> 01:09:56,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd stop Minion.

989
01:09:56,550 --> 01:09:58,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd stop the robot army and hope...

990
01:09:58,890 --> 01:10:00,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that the world would forgive me.

991
01:10:03,350 --> 01:10:04,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're my hero,Floop...

992
01:10:04,850 --> 01:10:08,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so I'm gonna help you,then you're gonna help me.

993
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:11,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Minion must be stopped. - Just one thing.

994
01:10:13,030 --> 01:10:15,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My show...what does it need?

995
01:10:15,780 --> 01:10:18,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know it needs something desperately...

996
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:20,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I can't figure it out.

997
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:22,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe you can?

998
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:24,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It needs children.

999
01:10:26,580 --> 01:10:28,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold still.

1000
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:41,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now let's stop Minion.

1001
01:10:41,140 --> 01:10:44,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Must be stopped. Must be stopped !

1002
01:10:48,230 --> 01:10:50,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This one's for my sister!

1003
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:55,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,Juni.

1004
01:10:55,190 --> 01:10:56,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hola.

1005
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:02,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Carmen? Juni?

1006
01:11:02,870 --> 01:11:05,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Mom ! - Mom ! Aah !

1007
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:07,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's my Fooglie!

1008
01:11:08,830 --> 01:11:11,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The one I drew.

1009
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:17,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's dad.

1010
01:11:17,090 --> 01:11:18,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're here!

1011
01:11:18,630 --> 01:11:22,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What's he doing here? - He's OK. He's OK.

1012
01:11:23,930 --> 01:11:25,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How did you get here?

1013
01:11:28,060 --> 01:11:32,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom,I've been skipping school,going places...

1014
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:35,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}taking ferry rides in the city...

1015
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:43,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's OK. It's OK. I know.

1016
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:45,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll talk about it when we get home.

1017
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:47,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Running off to Belize. - What? You went where?

1018
01:11:47,620 --> 01:11:49,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're right. Let's just talk about this when we get home.

1019
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,no,no,no.

1020
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:54,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can tell me everything now,OK?

1021
01:11:54,170 --> 01:11:56,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that where you want to be,free from your family?

1022
01:11:59,420 --> 01:12:02,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I used to. Not anymore.

1023
01:12:05,010 --> 01:12:08,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You turned my dad into a Fooglie?

1024
01:12:08,770 --> 01:12:09,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,I didn't.

1025
01:12:11,020 --> 01:12:13,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I might be able to change him back.

1026
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gentlemen...

1027
01:12:33,170 --> 01:12:36,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}your army marches to meet us as we speak.

1028
01:12:36,250 --> 01:12:39,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your faith and your patience have meant more than you know.

1029
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:42,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I speak for Mr. Floop when I say that the value...

1030
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:45,470

1031
01:12:45,550 --> 01:12:47,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Minion! This is Floop.

1032
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:49,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please report to the robotics lab at once.

1033
01:12:49,470 --> 01:12:51,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have huge,major,big-time problems with the robots.

1034
01:12:51,930 --> 01:12:54,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought you said Floop wasn't here.

1035
01:12:54,650 --> 01:12:56,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's not.

1036
01:12:56,190 --> 01:12:59,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A problem,Mr. Minion,as in mucho grande problemo.

1037
01:12:59,860 --> 01:13:03,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna just be a moment.

1038
01:13:07,030 --> 01:13:09,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Minion!

1039
01:13:09,490 --> 01:13:11,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Floop?

1040
01:13:11,330 --> 01:13:13,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are you?

1041
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:15,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Behind you.

1042
01:13:17,750 --> 01:13:19,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you think you're doing?

1043
01:13:19,250 --> 01:13:20,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're supposed to be in line with the others.

1044
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:23,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're supposed to be with the others.

1045
01:13:23,260 --> 01:13:25,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Stop that. - Stop that!

1046
01:13:26,010 --> 01:13:28,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Stop that this instant! - Stop that this instant!

1047
01:13:28,350 --> 01:13:30,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop that right now!

1048
01:13:30,310 --> 01:13:32,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or what?

1049
01:13:38,690 --> 01:13:41,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Clever boy you've got there,Cortez. Very clever indeed.

1050
01:13:41,820 --> 01:13:44,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. He gets that from his mother.

1051
01:13:44,950 --> 01:13:50,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I offer some sort of truce in exchange for your daughter?

1052
01:13:50,540 --> 01:13:51,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Spoken for.

1053
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:54,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There you are. Didn't see you. Didn't see her.

1054
01:13:55,870 --> 01:13:59,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am going to show you what happens...

1055
01:13:59,210 --> 01:14:01,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when you cross the line and involve family.

1056
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:04,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now let's get nice and comfortable.

1057
01:14:06,260 --> 01:14:07,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

1058
01:14:09,550 --> 01:14:11,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Promising. Thank you.

1059
01:14:14,770 --> 01:14:18,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You couldn't possibly. - No,but you can.

1060
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:22,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't let go,Ingrid.

1061
01:14:22,650 --> 01:14:24,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey,you two,come on.

1062
01:14:28,990 --> 01:14:30,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fools.

1063
01:14:39,130 --> 01:14:40,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

1064
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:43,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have to keep the army from leaving the castle.

1065
01:14:43,550 --> 01:14:45,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our only chance is to get to the control room...

1066
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:48,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and hope that their missions have not been programmed.

1067
01:14:48,050 --> 01:14:49,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And what if they have?

1068
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:51,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then there's no one on earth who can stop them.

1069
01:14:53,010 --> 01:14:55,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- One at a time. - Go. Go.

1070
01:15:01,940 --> 01:15:04,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Left,left,left,left!

1071
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:07,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That way. Where's Mom and Dad?

1072
01:15:09,490 --> 01:15:11,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your doppelgangers have them.

1073
01:15:11,070 --> 01:15:12,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you shut them down from here?

1074
01:15:12,780 --> 01:15:14,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's too late.

1075
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:16,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Third Brain is linked not only to them...

1076
01:15:16,450 --> 01:15:17,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but to all the robot children.

1077
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:20,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Can't you remove it? - We can't take 500 brains out!

1078
01:15:20,750 --> 01:15:24,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- So don't. Just reprogram it. - That would take weeks!

1079
01:15:24,590 --> 01:15:27,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Just two words. - A binary switch. Of course.

1080
01:15:27,050 --> 01:15:29,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So they would define right as wrong...

1081
01:15:29,550 --> 01:15:32,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And wrong as right. Come on.

1082
01:15:32,550 --> 01:15:34,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But it's not that simple.

1083
01:15:34,180 --> 01:15:35,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Figure it out. We'll be back for you.

1084
01:15:35,890 --> 01:15:38,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Teach them to be good.

1085
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:45,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have a seat,Mr. Lithp. You'll be more comfortable.

1086
01:15:45,190 --> 01:15:46,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's Lisp.

1087
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:52,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My army,Ms. Gradenko,is the only comfort I need.

1088
01:15:53,030 --> 01:15:54,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're on their way now,sir.

1089
01:15:56,540 --> 01:15:58,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Minion?

1090
01:15:58,710 --> 01:16:01,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happened to your head?

1091
01:16:01,330 --> 01:16:04,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,don't worry. I think it's reversible.

1092
01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:09,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom ! Dad !

1093
01:16:15,890 --> 01:16:17,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Careful.

1094
01:16:17,970 --> 01:16:21,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're stronger and smarter now.

1095
01:16:21,310 --> 01:16:22,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So are we.

1096
01:16:32,570 --> 01:16:33,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See?

1097
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:41,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,shi...take mushrooms.

1098
01:17:11,780 --> 01:17:13,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go.

1099
01:17:16,410 --> 01:17:20,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lisp. Should have known you were behind this.

1100
01:17:20,290 --> 01:17:22,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I take it you are Minion.

1101
01:17:23,410 --> 01:17:26,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ms. Gradenko...I think.

1102
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:28,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,it's me,all right.

1103
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:30,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I owe my new look to your children.

1104
01:17:30,590 --> 01:17:32,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remind me to raise their allowance.

1105
01:17:32,630 --> 01:17:34,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Minion,I think now would be a good time...

1106
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:39,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to see a demonstration of your wonderfully demonic children.

1107
01:17:39,850 --> 01:17:40,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Certainly.

1108
01:17:57,870 --> 01:18:00,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your parents were so easy to capture...

1109
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:01,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you're not any better.

1110
01:18:01,870 --> 01:18:04,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Poor little Juni.

1111
01:18:04,660 --> 01:18:07,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Defenseless and weak.

1112
01:18:13,630 --> 01:18:16,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're a worthless little squirt.

1113
01:18:17,970 --> 01:18:22,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Juni! Don't listen to her. You're not worthless!

1114
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:25,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You figured out how to get us here.

1115
01:18:25,140 --> 01:18:28,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You helped Floop realize he was good,not bad.

1116
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:31,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You talked to the Fooglies and saved Mom and Dad.

1117
01:18:31,150 --> 01:18:35,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're strong,Juni! You're strong!

1118
01:18:38,070 --> 01:18:40,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not that strong,Juni!

1119
01:18:42,370 --> 01:18:45,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Puny...Juni.

1120
01:18:45,330 --> 01:18:47,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's all over.

1121
01:19:03,510 --> 01:19:05,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Instant cement!

1122
01:19:09,810 --> 01:19:12,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That should hold them.

1123
01:19:15,780 --> 01:19:17,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Let's go find Mom and Dad. - Good idea.

1124
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:21,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All robots report to the grand room...

1125
01:19:21,570 --> 01:19:26,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for a final demonstration of your destructive powers.

1126
01:19:28,290 --> 01:19:30,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Mom,Dad ! - Juni!

1127
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:31,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Carmen,Juni,close your eyes.

1128
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:33,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't want you to see this,OK?

1129
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:49,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Any ideas?

1130
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:51,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm thinking. I'm thinking.

01:21:26,620 --> 01:21:28,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For the same reason I left.

1155

01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:43,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's OK. Let it go. Let it go.

1160

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So,what did you teach them?

1164
01:21:57,440 --> 01:22:00,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not what I can teach the children...

1165
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:03,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but what you taught me.

1166
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:05,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You won today,Juni,and not because...

01:22:07,490 --> 01:22:11,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but because you were pure of heart and of mind.

1169
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:15,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And now the robots have learned that as well.

1170
01:22:15,710 --> 01:22:17,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

1171
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We went on the old-fashioned adventure I always wanted.

1172
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:24,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And we didn't do one thing right.

1173
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:26,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nope.

1174
01:22:26,300 --> 01:22:29,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We did two things right.

1175
01:22:29,850 --> 01:22:32,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There is something that we have to tell you.

1176

1186
01:23:21,270 --> 01:23:23,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I gotta have the business section.
