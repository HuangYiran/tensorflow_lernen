00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,350
上溯至宇宙初始  周遭还只是一片漆黑
In the beginning, there was darkness,

10
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:04,230
接着  忽地一声巨响 
and then-- Bang!

11
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,030
时间空间以及物质皆由此发端
Giving birth to to an endless expanding existence

12
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,240
此后不断膨胀  延伸  永无止境
of time, space, and matter.

13
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:14,280
每一天  新的发现不断为我们解开
Every day new discoveries are unlocking the mysterious, the mind-blowing,

14
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,970
宇宙神秘的  惊人的和致命的秘密
the deadly secrets of a place we call the universe.

15
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:22,880
太阳系
The Solar System.

16
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:28,310
它是如何在星际混乱的湮没中形成的
How did it emerge from the oblivion of interstellar chaos?

17
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,570
我们是由气体和灰尘组成的
We are made of gas and dust.

18
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:37,240
今日太阳和行星中藏有它们的身世奇迷  
Today the sun and planets hold fascinating clues to their origins

19
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,340
它们起源于一团极其微小而不可见的颗粒
in a haze of particles so small, they're virtually invisible.

20
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,830
我们过去的证据  就在我们周围
The evidence of our past is all around us.

21
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,300
然而  创造出太阳系的巨大力量
But are the titanic forces that created our Solar System

22
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,650
在整个宇宙中是常见的吗
common throughout the universe?

23
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,420
开普勒候选系统  952

24
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,380
还是我们是特殊的
Or are we unique?

25
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:57,550
我们的太阳系似乎是很特殊的
Our Solar System seems to be one of the oddballs.

26
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,910
宇宙也许有无数方式来创造恒星和行星
The universe may have countless strategies for crafting stars and planets,

27
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:08,600
但是仅有一法能够决定太阳系的形成
but only one could determine how the Solar System was made.

28
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,760
太阳系约在46亿年前开始形成
It begins at a point in time nearly 4.6 billion years ago.

29
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,810
一大团气体云诡异地在
A giant cloud of gas and dust floats eerily

30
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:38,320
银河偏远的旁支漂浮
through a remote arm of the Milky Way,

31
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,860
其温度为零下四百余度
chilled to more than 400 degrees below zero.

32
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:46,220
当它独自在那儿
When it's sitting there all alone

33
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:50,150
亚历克・菲力彭科
加州大学伯克利分校

34
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,830
这团分子云中  没什么会发生
nothing much is happening in a molecular cloud.

35
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,160
它的温度很低
The temperatures are very low.

36
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,650
那些粒子移动得非常缓慢
The particles are moving around very, very slowly.

37
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,050
几乎就是静止不动
It's just sitting there.

38
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,560
但若附近有一颗超新星  即爆炸的恒星
But if you have a nearby supernova, an exploding star,

39
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,550
它就会释放冲击波穿过这团分子云
it can send a shockwave through this molecular cloud...

40
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,960
从而触发了引力坍缩
triggering its gravitational collapse.

41
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:10,090
这种坍缩是长期过程中的第一步
That collapse is the first step in a long process

42
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,940
这个过程促使了现在太阳系的形成
that brings the place we now call the Solar System into existence.

43
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:25,810
0至7亿年

44
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:24,460
现在我们要跟随其最初7亿年的时间线
Our mission now will be to follow a timeline of the first 700 million years,

45
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,310
在这段时间内  太阳系形成并趋于稳定
the epoch in which the Solar System formed and stabilized.

46
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:35,060
我们先来看看如今的太阳和其行星
We start by looking at the Sun and its planets as they are today.

47
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,330
我们过去的证据  就在我们周围
The evidence of our past is all around us.

48
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,350
在内太阳系的四颗行星 
The four planets in the inner part of the Solar System

49
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,620
由岩石和金属组成
are made of rock and metal,

50
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,940
而外太阳系的四颗行星
and the four planets in the outter part of the Solar System

51
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,960
则是巨大的气体星球
are these giant balls of gas.

52
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,820
迈克尔・密史纳
美国宇航局  喷气推进实验所

53
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,990
很明显  太阳系的形成经历很多不同的过程 
So clearly, different processes were at play,

54
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,890
这也表明了我们是如何走到这一步的
and that tells us something about how we got here.

55
00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:00,890
我们所知情形和现在科学家相信发生的无异
We learn the story as scientists presently believe it happened,

56
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:03,650
它发生于太阳系诞生的伊始
from time zero, the very beginning of our Solar System.

57
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:14,050
零点

58
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:09,800
超新星爆炸不仅给这巨大的气体云团
The supernova explosion not only seeds the giant gas cloud

59
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,130
带来了铁和铀这类重元素
with heavy elements like iron and uranium,

60
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:17,480
爆炸带来的震动将这团云推向了未来  
the jolt of the explosion gives the cloud a push into the future,

61
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:22,580
波前锋将云团的气体压缩成一种临界物质
as wave fronts compress the cloud's gases into a critical mass.

62
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,250
在引力作用下  这一团物质开始坍缩 
That mass begins to collapse under the force of gravity,

63
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:30,880
该过程无法停止  急速并且不可逆转
and then it's unstoppable. It's rapid, it's irreversible.

64
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,460
艾德・杨
加利福尼亚大学  洛杉矶分校

65
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,080
就像过山车达到轨道顶端 
It's like a roller coaster reaching the top of its track

66
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,050
然后急速冲下另一边一样
and speeding down the other side.

67
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:45,530
这个注定要成为太阳系的坍缩云团 
The collapsing cloud destined to become our solar System

68
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:49,160
成为了一座混沌运动的主题公园
becomes a virtual theme park of chaotic motion.

69
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:56,110
像北仙乐园这样的游乐园很适合让人们
An amusement park like North Fairy Farm is a great place to people to come

70
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,270
体验那种早期太阳系形成时的运动现象
and experience a kind of a motion that happens in the early solar system.

71
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:58,540
克利福德・强森
南加州大学

72
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:05,630
有引力  碰撞  动力  推力
There's gravity. There's collisions, momentum, forces.

73
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:09,150
在早期太阳系里发生的所有作用 
All of those interactions that took place in the early Solar system

74
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,600
都能在这里的不同游乐项目中体现出来
can be found here on all the different kinds of rides.

75
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:18,820
在迅速坍缩的云团中  相互作用更为激烈
Those interactions intensify in the rapidly collapsing cloud,

76
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:23,060
气体和灰尘密集形成致密区域
where gas and dust contracts into dense pockets.

77
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,630
每一片区域都是恒星的温床
Each will become the nursery of a star.

78
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:30,670
当巨大的分子云被触发并且开始坍缩 
When the giant molecular cloud was triggered and started to collapse,

79
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,060
很多原恒星和很多太阳系 
a lot of other protostars and a lot of other solar systems

80
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,800
也都同时诞生了
were formed at the same time.

81
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,930
所以太阳的周围其实有许多 
So our Sun actually has a lot of brother and sister stars

82
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,640
兄弟姐妹恒星  他们也在那时诞生
that formed right around the same time as the Sun.

83
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:47,190
太阳系形成的第一阶段
The first stages of our Solar System's creation

84
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,780
并不特殊
are hardly unique.

85
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:53,430
如今我们看到同样的事情发生在猎户座星云
Today we witness the same thing happening in the Orion constellation,

86
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:59,340
一团巨大的分子云  延展数百光年
where a giant molecular cloud stretches hundreds of light years across.

87
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:05,230
其中  坍缩区域正在孕育年轻的星球群
In some places, collapsing pockets are now forming clusters of young stars,

88
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:08,410
它们照亮了周围的气体
which light up the surrounding gas.

89
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,930
游乐场中的环形运动
The circus of motions in the amusement park

90
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,180
巧妙地模拟了构成太阳系的
aptly parallels the movements of space matter

91
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,080
太空物质的运动
that comes together to make the Solar System.

92
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,930
这些运动中最基本的是圆周运动  
The most basic of these motions is circular,

93
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,310
就像天空旋转木马
like a celestial carousel.

94
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,420
当前太阳系云团坍缩时
As the pre-solar cloud collapses,

95
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,820
我们开始注意到它的旋转
we begin to notice its rotation,

96
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:41,850
5万年

97
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:40,580
这个旋转其实从一开始就存在
a spin that's actually been there from the beginning.

98
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,230
整个星系都在旋转
The entire galaxy rotates.

99
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,890
星系中的所有物质都在旋转
Everything in the galaxy rotates.

100
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:47,810
每种物质相对于其它物质都在旋转
Everything is rotating with respect to everything else.

101
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:52,410
所以旋转是恒星坍缩物理学的重要部分
And so rotation is part and parcel to the physics of-- of stellar collapse.

102
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,270
接下来发生的  就如同旋转的冰上选手
What happens next resembles a spinning ice skater.

103
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:02,500
当她收起胳膊  便旋转得更快
When she draws in her arms, she spins faster.

104
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,860
当引力将云团中的气体聚集
As gravity draws in the cloud's gas,

105
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,330
云团不仅仅旋转得更快
the cloud not only spins faster...

106
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,710
不可避免的  它形成了碟形
It inevitably flattens into a disc.

107
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:19,200
我们在地球上也能看到类似的过程
We can see a similar process at work on Earth.

108
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,070
在加州的乔・卡里亚蒂玻璃吹制工作室 
In places like Joe Cariati's glass blowing workshop in California,

109
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,450
天文学家劳拉・丹利正在观察吹制过程
where astronomer Laura Danly is observing the action.

110
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:33,100
乔先取出一团红热的液态玻璃
Joe begins with a round blob of red-hot molten glass.

111
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:37,530
其实我们就是拿出一个圆形实体
We basically just are taking a solid mass that was round

112
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,800
然后旋转它
and spinning it.

113
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,200
它变得扁平是因为液体
It flattens because it's much easier for the fluid,

114
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,560
也就是液态玻璃 
the fluid of this liquid glass,

115
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:48,710
更容易围绕着旋转轴坍缩 
to collapse in the same axes along the axes of spinning

116
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,870
而不是抗拒旋转和角动量 
rather than try to fight the spin

117
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:54,100
向中心聚集
or fight the angular momentum and move closer.

118
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:51,720
劳拉・丹利
格里菲斯天文台

119
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:57,810
正如我们的太阳系  若行星在此形成  
And just like in our Solar System, if there were planets forming in there,

120
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,630
它们会在同一个平面上
they'd all be in the same plane.

121
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,050
这就像是我们的太阳系原行星盘一样
It's just like the disc of our Solar System.

122
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,550
现在  它看起来是个椭圆  而非圆形
Now, it looks kind of elliptical. It's not circular.

123
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,750
我们认为太阳系的圆形的
We think of our own Solar System as being circular.

124
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:13,150
但是我记得你告诉过我  原因是一边偏重
But I think you told me it had to do with there being more mass on one side.

125
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:16,000
所以这也许有点像双子星的形成
So maybe it's kind of like an analog of a binary star forming,

126
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,100
也就是  质量大一点的一边
where you've got maybe extra mass on one side that's

127
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,420
会形成恒星或褐矮星  又或者
also going to form into a star or a brown dwarf or maybe a--

128
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:25,040
一颗非常重的  类似木星的行星
just a very massive Jupiter-like planet.

129
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,650
真想摸摸它  但估计是个坏主意
It's so tempting to touch it, but I imagine it's a bad idea.

130
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:30,500
不  我们不能碰它  真的不能碰
Oh, no, we can't do that. Yeah. We can't do that.

131
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:42,230
十万年

132
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:38,000
时间到十万年时
100 thousand years after it began,

133
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,230
将要变为太阳系的云气彻底塌缩
the cloud that would become our Solar System is almost entirely collapsed

134
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,970
云气中心被逐渐形成的原恒星照亮
and its center is glowing with the radiance of an emerging protostar.

135
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,230
原恒星是恒星最原始的状态
A protostar is the very early state as of becoming a star,

136
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,760
那时恒星仍在塌缩 
when the star is still collapsing down

137
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,920
辐射到周围的能量正来自于  
and the energy that is radiating out

138
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,280
那种引力坍缩
is coming from that gravitational collapse.

139
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,710
恒星仍将升温  因为其体积在缩小
It's still getting hotter because it's getting smaller.

140
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:59,250
麦克・布朗
加利福尼亚理工学院

141
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,640
恒星的形成过程 
It's not doing the nuclear reactions

142
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,850
其核心阶段与核反应过程是不同的
like a star will be doing when it's in its main phase of being a star.

143
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,180
出现的原恒星开始吞噬 
The emerging protostar begins gobbling up the disc of gas and dust

144
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,890
组成太阳星云的气体和灰尘
that makes up what's called the solar nebula.

145
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,500
大部分云气都变成了太阳的一部分
So much of it will end up in the Sun,

146
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,260
余下给行星  月球
then what's left over for the planets, moons,

147
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:26,740
星子  甚至我们身体的部分  非常少
asteroids, and even our own bodies is so meager,

148
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,480
就像宇宙的施舍一样
it's almost a cosmic afterthought.

149
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,210
我们住在一颗行星上
We happen to live on a planet,

150
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:39,350
所以行星的组成成分对我们很重要
so the stuff that went into making the planet is very important to us.

151
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:42,090
但这仅仅是整体的一小部分而已
But it was just a tiny part of the whole mix.

152
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:46,090
这个停车场很好地说明了这一部分有多渺小
This parking lot is a good way of showing how tiny.

153
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:48,590
在如今的太阳系中
When you look at the Solar System today,

154
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,340
太阳占了总质量的99.85%
the sun is 99.85% of the total mass.

155
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:56,220
在停车场里的500辆车之中  
So compared with the 500 cars in this parking lot,

156
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,640
我的车就和所有剩给
my car is just about all that's left over

157
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,310
行星  星子  和月球的成分一样
for all the planets, asteroids, and moons.

158
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:06,000
至于分给地球的
And as for the earth itself, well,

159
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,350
就和这个备胎分量一样  仅此而已
that might be comparable to this spare tire, nothing bigger.

160
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:20,230
一百万年

161
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,500
一百万年之后
At 1 million years after time zero

162
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,020
太阳系对行星建构材料的分类  
the Solar System's method for sorting out

163
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,990
已经很明确了
its planet building material is clear,

164
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:24,970
根据温度  它们分布在原行星盘的不同区域
they're separated by the different temperatures in the disc.

165
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,310
靠近原太阳的地方
Close to the protosun,

166
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,940
两千度的高温  蒸发了所有物质
temperatures above 2,000 degrees vaporize everything.

167
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:37,810
然而  在约八百万公里处  是岩石带
But about 5 million miles out lies the rock line,

168
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:42,780
岩石带

169
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:42,380
这里足够冷  让金属和矿物质固化
where it's cool enough for metals and minerals to turn solid.

170
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,670
更远的区域是冰雪带
Much farther out lies the snow line,

171
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:51,050
冰雪带

172
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:50,940
这儿最冷可达零下三百七十五度
where it's as much as 375 degrees below 0,

173
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:56,200
冷到能让水  甲烷和氨冷冻成冰
cold enough for water, methane, and ammonia to freeze into ices.

174
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:02,580
早期的太阳系  和做棉花糖相似
The early Solar System is a little bit like making cotton candy.

175
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,240
为了演示如何做棉花糖  
And to show us how cotton candy is made,

176
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,680
我们请凯西・吴 来为我们做美味糖果
we have Kathy Woo here to make us a delicious treat.

177
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,100
首先  我们拿出砂糖
First we take the sugar crystals,

178
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,060
然后将它倒入加热器中
and we pour that into the heating element.

179
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,860
在这里  加热器处于中间
The heating element in this case is here in the center.

180
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,310
在太阳系中  当然  也就是非常热的
In the case of the Solar System, of course, it's that very hot

181
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:21,810
太阳  它居中  融化一切靠近它的东西
sun in the middle that is melting things that are too close to it.

182
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,810
发热的太阳  
And as that, uh, that hot Sun heats up,

183
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:29,400
它开始融化它周围的东西
it starts to melt the stuff that's close to it.

184
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,560
出来了
Whoa, there it comes.

185
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,180
你可以看见  周围飞舞的是太阳星云
This is now the solar nebula you can see flying around here.

186
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,560
在里面  你其实看不到任何东西
On the inside, you actually don't see anything.

187
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,090
东西都在里面融化了
The inside, it's all molten.

188
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:40,870
而在较冷的外围
And as it gets to the cooler outside,

189
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:44,220
太阳星云开始凝结
the solar nebula starts to condense.

190
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:48,350
你能看到  它开始在温度较低的
And you can see it starting to solidify all over the outside

191
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,230
太阳系外围固化
of the Solar System, where it's cold.

192
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:52,680
你可以看到内部的都是气体
You get a line of gaseous stuff on the inside

193
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,520
外围的都是固体
and the solid stuff on the outside.

194
00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:00,540
这与早期的原行星非常相似
This is also a very good analogy for what those early protoplanets are like.

195
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:04,130
它们开始互相粘结
They start to accrete by all sticking together,

196
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,340
非常像这些棉花糖
very much like this cotton candy does,

197
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,770
这些东西变得越来越大
and make larger and larger things

198
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:12,750
仅仅来自于这些小颗粒晶体  也就是
coming from these tiny little pieces of--of crystal that are

199
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,970
棉花糖中的糖
the sugar that's in the cotton candy.

200
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:17,350
-谢谢  -不客气
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

201
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,060
太阳系真好吃
The Solar System is delicious.

202
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:25,070
粘结在一起的微粒  现阶段还很微小
The particles sticking together are microscopic at this point,

203
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,160
远远小于融化的砂糖
far smaller than the melting sugar crystals.

204
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:33,050
棉花糖展示了太阳系中的颗粒如何粘结  
And as cotton candy illustrates how these solids accrete in the solar System,

205
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:37,410
另一个游乐场项目表明了它们如何增大
another amusement park attraction shows what makes them grow.

206
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,230
碰碰车如果不碰撞的话  就不好玩了
Bumper cars wouldn't be much fun without collisions.

207
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,910
在太阳系中  没有碰撞
And in the Solar System, without collisions,

208
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:48,770
就没有成长和积累
there would be no growth, no accretion.

209
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,760
早期太阳系中发生的积累碰撞
The accretion collisions that were happening in the early solar System

210
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,580
碰撞使物体 
are of the kind that allow objects to stick together

211
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:02,790
通过摩擦过程而得到粘结
through various kinds of essentially friction-type processes,

212
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,450
这些东西因为力学作用
where you have things getting stuck together

213
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:08,110
而结合在了一起
just due to mechanical interaction.

214
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,050
在内太阳系里
In the inner Solar System,

215
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:14,850
这是个耗时的过程  
the process is time-consuming,

216
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,370
因为微小的宇宙尘粒形成缓慢  
as tiny cosmic dust balls form slowly,

217
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,980
只能在围绕早期太阳的公转中 
stuck together only by random collisions

218
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,180
通过随机碰撞得到粘结
in their orbits around the early Sun.

219
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,860
但在外太阳系  情况便大为不同了
But in the outer Solar System, the story is dramatically different.

220
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:32,750
巨大的星球就在弹指一挥间
The giant planets are about to burst into existence

221
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,100
突然地出现
in a cosmic blink of an eye.

222
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,090
从气体和灰尘构成的云团开始
Beginning as a cloud of gas and dust,

223
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:52,360
太阳系的形成需耗时七亿年之久
the making of our Solar System will take 700 million years.

224
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:56,480
现在  诞生两百万年之后
Now, just 2 million years after its birth,

225
00:12:54,130 --> 00:13:01,290
两百万年

226
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,550
这个年轻的系统开始创造一个行星家族
the young system takes its first steps in creating a family of planets,

227
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:05,210
这个家族有朝一日会诞出木星  土星
that one day will be as diverse as Jupiter, Saturn...

228
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,470
和地球
or the Earth.

229
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,450
目前  它们还只是一堆堆的物质
For now though, they're just chunks of matter

230
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,430
仍在混乱的太阳星云中坐着过山车
continuing their rollercoaster ride in the turbulence of the solar nebula.

231
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:37,620
主要由氢气组成的旋转大原行星盘里  
The thick rotating disc made mostly of hydrogen gas,

232
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,870
固体点缀其中
is embedded with solids.

233
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:44,270
内部区域充满了小石块
The inner zone is filled with small chunks of rock,

234
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:46,920
岩石带

235
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:47,260
但外围则是冰雪带
but outside the boundary known as the snow line,

236
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,680
这儿也有冻结的甲烷  氨和水
there are also ices of methane, ammonia, and water

237
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:55,070
冰雪带

238
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:56,270
它们主宰了原行星盘外圈  这是有原因的
which dominate the outer disc, and for good reason.

239
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:00,330
它们都是不同形态的氢化物
They're all hydrogen compounds of one form or another.

240
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,690
克利福德・强森 
南加州大学

241
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:03,840
在那时的太阳系中
And hydrogen is the most abundant element

242
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,760
氢是最主要的元素
in the region of the Solar System at that point.

243
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,810
大量的氢和其它元素结合  比如
That abundant hydrogen is combining with elements such as

244
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:13,400
和氧气合成水  和碳合成甲烷
oxygen to form the water, or carbon to form the methane,

245
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:17,630
或者和氮合成氨  从而有了这些合成物
or nitrogen to form the ammonia, and giving us those compounds,

246
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,140
它们随后凝结成冰
which are then freezing out.

247
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,630
在扰动中不断的碰撞
Continual collisions amid the turbulence...

248
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,040
使微小的灰尘的冰粒
make tiny specks of dust and ice

249
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,330
由于摩擦产生静电荷而结合在一起
stick together through friction and static electricity

250
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:38,700
直至它们大到重力可以对它们产生影响
until they're large enough for gravity to take over.

251
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:42,870
最终它们形成星子
Eventually, they become planetesimals.

252
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:52,440
迈克尔・密史纳  美国国家航空航天局/喷气推进实验室

253
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:48,490
星子是太阳系形成的原始基础
Planetesimals were the original building box of our Solar System.

254
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:49,910
它们出奇的小
They're incredibly small,

255
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:52,450
直径大约在800到1600米
only about half a mile to a mile across,

256
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:54,740
但在早期的太阳系中有无数的星子
but there was countless numbers in the early Solar System,

257
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,310
它们到处都是
it was simply littered with them.

258
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:59,230
这些直径800米的星子
These half-mile planetesimals

259
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:05,300
最终将形成大行星  但却大小不一
will eventually form full-scale planets, but of distinctly different sizes.

260
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,350
这就是来自加州圣马特奥市的瑞安・陈
That's what Ryan Chan of San Mateo, California

261
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:11,880
想要对宇宙提出的问题
wanted to ask the universe by writing...

262
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,220
询问宇宙

263
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:18,590
为什么靠近太阳的行星要比远离太阳的大行星小
-瑞安・陈 圣马特奥 加州

瑞安  内太阳系的行星要比外围的小
Ryan, the inner planets are smaller than the outter planets

265
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:26,210
因为内行星的组成原料不够充足
because the inner planets didn't have much material from which to be made.

266
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:29,340
只有金属  石头什么的
Just metals, and rocks and things like that.

267
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,800
但是外围的行星在形成一个类地的核心后
But outter planets, after forming an earthlike core,

268
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,690
可以吸收冰态的水 甲烷和二氧化碳
were able to attract ices of water, amonium, methane and carbon dioxide

269
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:38,770
这使它们变得更大  
that made them get bigger,

270
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:44,260
同时它们的引力吸引气体从而越来越大
and then their gravitationally attracted gases, becoming much, much bigger.

271
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,050
诞生起点后的三百万年  
3 million years after time zero,

272
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,820
星子合并为 更大的东西  
planetesimals are merging into bigger objects

273
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:58,170
我们称之为行星胚胎或者原行星
called planet embryos or protoplanets.

274
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,560
询问宇宙

275
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:56,460
三百万年

276
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,870
原行星是由星子形成的
Protoplanets are built up of planetesimals,

277
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:04,280
因此它们更大  和月亮差不多大
so they're larger, about the size of our Moon.

278
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:09,290
在冰雪带之外  处处皆冰
Just beyond the snow line, where ice is most abundant,

279
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:12,650
随着大量原行星的碰撞和融合
the teeming mob of protoplanets collide and fuse

280
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,960
行星迅速形成
in a frenzy of planet-building.

281
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,950
只用了三百万年  
Within just 3 million years,

282
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:21,090
这些碰撞便形成一颗冰冻的早期行星
these collisions give birth to a frozen young planet

283
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:25,000
而它注定成为太阳系中的巨头
destined to become the monster of the Solar System...

284
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,200
它就是早期的木星
The infant Jupiter.

285
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:32,400
亚历克・弗里喷库  
加州大学伯克利分校

286
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,690
在它成为巨大的行星之前
Before it became a giant planet,

287
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,530
木星就好像是一颗巨型地球
Jupiter was like a sort of super Earth.

288
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:33,860
质量是地球的十到十五倍
Maybe 10 or 15 Earth masses.

289
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:39,220
早期的木星由岩石和冰组成  并且不断增大
The early Jupiter is made of rock and ice and continues to grow.

290
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,140
在一个关键时刻
At a crucial moment,

291
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:44,990
最后一颗原行星撞到了木星表面
one last protoplanet slams into its surface.

292
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,540
对于太阳系的形成
It's another roller coaster like tipping point

293
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,150
这又是一次转折性的时刻
in the making of the Solar System.

294
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:06,370
增加的质量使木星突破临界点  
The added mass sends Jupiter over the edge

295
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,900
变成一个引力强大的行星
to become a gravitational bully.

296
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:12,580
当它达到一个临界质量后  
After it reached a certain critical mass,

297
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:16,950
木星的引力可以快速的吸引原料
Jupiter's gravity was able to very quickly draw in material,

298
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:21,380
类似失控效应  它迅速变大
sort of a runaway effect that made it very large very fast.

299
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,220
就像一台宇宙吸尘器
Like a cosmic vacuum cleaner,

300
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:28,300
木星吸引了在它运行轨道上的所有气体
Jupiter sweeps up virtually all the gas in its orbital path,

301
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:33,680
增至现在体积的90%  这只用了十万年
growing to 90% of its present size in just 100,000 years.

302
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,260
土星  海王星和天王星在木星之后
Saturn, Neptune, and Uranus in turn follow Jupiter

303
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:43,330
吞噬了足够的气体  变身为气体巨星
in devouring enough gas to become gas giants.

304
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,340
这种一颗或多颗行星的吞噬行为
The dramatic sweep of one or more planets

305
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,830
为恒星盘清理出了一条轨道
clearing a lane through a disc around a star

306
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:52,400
这种现象在宇宙中十分常见
is thought to be common in the universe,

307
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:56,490
最近一次观测发现证实了此现象
a fact borne out in recent telescope discoveries.

308
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:01,610
该过程在其他太阳系形成中也曾出现
We see this process happening in other solar systems being formed as well.

309
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,550
最终我们可以捕捉其他恒星周围的原行星盘
We're finally at the point where we can image other discs around stars

310
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,600
以及环绕它们的大行星
and the gaps that are being created by the large planets

311
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,070
所清理出的缺口
that are orbiting them.

312
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:17,150
11年初  天文学家用夏威夷的斯巴鲁望远镜
In early 2011, astronomers using the Subaru telescope in Hawaii

313
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:21,900
拍到了一张距地球450光年的恒星照片
released a photograph of a star 450 light years from earth.

314
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,380
先进的光学掩模使他们可以
An advanced optical mask allowed them

315
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:29,000
屏蔽掉恒星本身的光芒
to block out the light of the star itself,

316
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,920
显示出原行星盘首个直接图像
revealing the first direct image of a disc with zones

317
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,590
以及行星清理出的区域
cleared out by orbiting planets.

318
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:39,930
那是一张惊人的高分辨率照片
That's a really amazing high-resolution image

319
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:44,050
从它可已看出由气体和灰尘形成的原行星盘
that shows a disc of gas and dust around a star,

320
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:47,220
以及内层已被一颗或多颗行星吸附
and the inner parts have been carved out by one or more planets

321
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:50,340
作为原料
that have accreted material

322
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,120
同时将其它原料驱走
and also flung other material away.

323
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:57,030
经过三百万年时间
3 million years along the timeline,

324
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:00,780
木星和土星已经成为太阳系的巨头
Jupiter and Saturn are now the titans of the Solar System.

325
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:05,640
这两个巨头最终包含了
The two giant planets will eventually contain 92%

326
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:09,580
整个星系92%的非太阳质量
of all the non-solar mass in the entire system.

327
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,470
在它形成的一千万年内
10 million years into its life,

328
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:18,020
年轻的太阳系几乎没有气体了
the young Solar System is virtually out of gas.

329
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,470
而正是是氢气和氦气
In this case the gas is the hydrogen and helium

330
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:20,180
一千万年

331
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:25,550
造就了木星和土星的快速成长
that fueled Jupiter and Saturn's swift growth.

332
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,530
恒星形成过程中会释放超级太阳风
The forming star had this huge solar wind that was

333
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:30,990
将原料吹离太阳系
clearing material out of the Solar System.

334
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,700
木星和土星十分幸运  
Jupiter and Saturn were fortunate enough

335
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,020
它们吞噬了轨道上吹散的大部分原料
to pick up most of this material in their orbits,

336
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,640
所以他们特别大
which is why they're so large.

337
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,950
天王星和海王星则不那么走运
Uranus and Neptune were a bit later to the game

338
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:41,150
他们没能得到那么多原料
and were unable to pick up as much material,

339
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:43,260
所以他们要比木星和土星小
which is why they're smaller than Jupiter and Saturn.

340
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,170
在灰尘和气体被吹走的这段时间
During the time before the dust and gas were blown away,

341
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:51,870
正在形成的太阳系在宇宙中深藏不露
the forming Solar System was largely hidden from the rest of the universe.

342
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:55,950
尽管灰尘和气体形成了行星
Even as dust and gas were forming planets,

343
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,840
但原行星盘还是足够厚
the disc remained thick enough

344
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,900
能阻档来自太阳系中心的元太阳光
to block light from the protosun at the center.

在数倍日地距离的地方
At a distance of several Earth distances from the Sun

347
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,520
假如你向太阳看
for example, looking towards the Sun

348
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,400
在太阳系早期
in the early phases of the Solar System,

349
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,890
我们看不见太阳
we wouldn't be able to see the Sun.

350
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,770
根本没有可见光
We wouldn't be able to see the visible light.

351
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,210
那么早期的太阳系在遥远的
What would the early Solar System have looked like

352
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:22,430
外星人的眼中是什么样的呢
to alien astronomers gazing at us from even greater distances?

353
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:28,870
哈勃望远镜为我们拍下了几张距离地球
The Hubble space telescope shows us with photos of protoplanetary discs

354
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:33,810
1350光年之遥的恒星原行星盘的照片
in a star-forming region 1,350 light years from Earth.

355
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:38,550
相对于我们的视线
We can see them at a variety of angles, tilts

356
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:41,050
我们能从许多角度看到它们 
relative to our line of sight.

357
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,820
比如  若它是正面朝我们
For example, if they are face-on,

358
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,560
我们可以看到被星盘包围的一个中央恒星
we can see a central star surrounded by a disc.

359
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:48,490
但是当我们从侧面看时
But when we look at these objects edge-on,

360
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,270
气体和灰尘就会阻挡我们看恒星的视线 
the gas and dust that is between our line of sight

361
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,540
使我们无法看到它的光芒
and the central star blocks the light of the star.

362
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,890
但现在  自太阳系开始形成一千万年后
But now, 10 million years after the Solar System began to form,

363
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:04,830
气体和灰尘几乎散尽
with the dust and gas virtually gone,

364
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,570
准太阳的光芒照耀着宇宙
the sun-to-be shines brilliantly through space.

365
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:15,080
这时它还未真正经历恒星的形成过程
It has yet to go through the process of becoming a true star,

366
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,660
它在现代人的眼中还很陌生
and at this point, it would seem strange to modern eyes.

367
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:22,250
光谱与现在有很大区别
The spectrum of light was very different.

368
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,350
它释放出巨大的能量  和现在一样
So it was putting out a lot of energy, just as it does today,

369
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:28,290
但是在它的光谱中红色光谱更多
but it was actually much redder in its spectrum.

370
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:32,210
因此早期的太阳系和今天相比
So that early Solar System would have been a very different color

371
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,410
颜色大为不同
from what we see today.

372
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:38,030
原恒星是橘黄色的
The protostar, orange-yellow in appearance,

373
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,930
温度极高  活动剧烈
is a seething cauldron.

374
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:44,230
在一些星系中  
In some systems,

375
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:48,380
收缩云的中心只是闪烁着
the cores of contracting clouds never glow with anything more

376
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:51,230
棕矮星微弱的光芒
than the dim light of dull brown dwarfs.

377
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:55,630
我们早期的太阳现在面临一个关键时刻
Our early Sun now nears a critical point.

378
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:58,460
其炽热的内部是否会消散瓦解
Will its internal furnace sputter and fail,

379
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,930
还是会冲破核障碍
or will it breach the nuclear threshold

380
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:05,330
在广袤的星系中以真正的恒星之光闪耀
and shine across the galaxy with all the brilliance of a true star?

381
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,380
现在是太阳系形成过程中
We are now at the most critical point

382
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,060
至关重要的时刻
in the making of our Solar System.

383
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,220
太阳诞生五千万年后  
At 50 million years old,

384
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,570
原太阳及其周围的行星年龄
the protosun and its forming planets

385
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,080
连现在的百分之一都不到
are barely 1% of their present age.

386
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:28,030
在诸多系统中  
In many systems,

387
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:31,550
中央星没有有足够的质量使其全面燃烧
the central star doesn't have enough mass to fully ignite.

388
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,720
但是太阳却可以打破这一命运
But our Sun is about to overcome that fate.

389
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,720
它已到达热量和压力的临界点
It has reached the critical threshold of heat and pressure

390
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:42,870
因此其中心可以进行核聚变
where nuclear fusion can begin in its core.

391
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,580
借助与氢弹爆炸的同类能量
Using the same awesome energy that powers the hydrogen bomb,

392
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:56,250
太阳浴火而生  成为新生的完整恒星
our Sun bursts into life as a fully-formed newborn star.

从太阳系开始形成起
In about 50 million years into the life of the Solar System's,

395
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,910
的五千万年后
since it first began forming,

396
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,790
太阳进入了一个不同形成阶段
the Sun goes into a different phase,

397
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,560
不断燃烧氢气  进行核聚变
burning hydrogen, actually doing nuclear fusion.

398
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,490
那时太阳演变成了
At that point the sun becomes

399
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,080
我们现在所认为的完全意义上的恒星
what we think of as now a fully-fledged star.

400
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:19,480
太阳会随着核聚变不断向前发展
Nuclear fusion will carry the Sun into the distant future.

401
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:21,980
它会燃烧足够长的时间
It will burn long enough

402
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,990
以支撑地球上生命的进化
to support the evolution of life on Earth,

403
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:28,170
并将持续发光一百亿年
shining unceasingly for about 10 billion years.

404
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,740
与新生的太阳所不同
Unlike the newly nuclear Sun,

405
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,120
太阳系其他行星还未成形
the rest of the Solar System is far from mature.

406
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:43,690
四千万年前  冰雪带外冰冻的气体巨行星
40 million years earlier, the frozen gas giants outside 
the snow line

407
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,290
停止生长  达到其冰冻稳定期
ceased to grow and achieved an icy stability.

408
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,520
但在炽热的内太阳系
But in the hot inner solar system,

409
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,550
那里气体稀少  但充满岩石
where gas is rare but rocks abound,

410
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:56,850
依旧混乱不堪
chaos still reigns.

麦克・布朗
加利福尼亚理工学院

412
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:01,540
当太阳成为真正意义上的恒星时
By the time that the Sun has become a full-fledges star

413
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,560
太阳系内部的其他行星
the planets in the inner part of the Solar System

414
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,890
还处于形成过程中
are still trying to grow,

415
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,590
有些小型原行星聚齐在一起
there are small little protoplanets that are building together,

416
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:10,210
相互碰撞  逐渐变大
colliding, getting larger and larger,

417
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:12,520
最终形成太阳系中的
eventually to become those four big planets

418
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:14,150
四大行星
that we have in the inner Solar System.

419
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:19,340
在木星轨道内的一片狭小区域中
But just inside the orbit of Jupiter lies a narrow region

420
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,960
星子数量繁多
where the smaller planetesimals rule

421
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,180
而原行星则极其稀少
and protoplanets are rare.

422
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:30,390
这便是星子带  木星对其进行干扰
This is the asteroid belt, where Jupiter stirs things up

423
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,340
阻止了行星的形成
to prevent any planets from forming.

425
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:37,750
木星是最大的行星  它产生的重力影响
Jupiter is the largest planet so its gravitational influence

426
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,550
是太阳系中最大的
is the greatest in the Solar System.

427
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,400
在太阳系形成初期的一个时期
There was a point in the early Solar System

428
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,940
木星穿过了现在称为星子带的地方
where Jupiter was passing through what's now the asteroid belt,

429
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:46,730
加快了那里星子的运行速度
pumping up the velocities of the planetesimals there,

430
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:48,870
使它们相互间发生了毁灭性的碰撞
causing them to collide in a destructive manner.

431
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:49,750
然后它们就瓦解了
They blew apart.

432
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:54,420
我们试着模拟星子带中
We're gonna try to get a feel for what a destructive collision

433
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,750
所发生的毁灭性碰撞
is like in the asteroid belt.

434
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,820
但不能用真正的石头  因为它们太硬
But we can't use real rocks because they're too hard

435
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,010
而且我们能提供的速度很小  
and the velocities available to us are too slow,

436
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:00,630
所以我们要做的是
so what we're going to do

437
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,020
使用这些特制的轻质石头
is use these special lightweight rocks,

438
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:05,700
这些是由特效师瑞安・强森制作的
which were made for us by Ryan Johnson, a special effects artist.

439
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:07,640
瑞安  你能介绍一下
Ryan, can you tell us about

440
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:09,680
这些特制的星子模型吗
these special lightweight simulated asteroids?

441
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,610
没问题
Sure.

442
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,680
我们使用的这些模型
So these props that we've developed here

443
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:16,190
是类似泡沫塑料的东西  在电影中
are a foamed plaster-type material that we use to

444
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,430
用来充当真正的石头
simulate real rocks in movies and films and things like that.

445
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,390
当我们想要打碎一些坚硬的东西时
Whenever we want something to break that looks like it's hard,

446
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,210
这种东西很容易就能碎掉  能变得粉碎
this stuff breaks really easy, and it crumbles.

447
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:28,630
所以我们要用这种材料
So what we've done is we've taken this same material,

448
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,600
制造一个更大的模型
and we've developed a much larger one

449
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,030
来模拟星子
we're gonna use to simulate an asteroid.

450
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,600
这里有两个
So we've got two of these,

451
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:38,360
我们要把他们狠狠地杂碎
and we'll smash 'em together really hard,

452
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:40,220
希望能模拟出星子碰撞的效果
and that'll hopefully simulate the collision of an asteroid.

453
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:41,580
你觉得我们应该用多大速度
So what sort of speed do you think we need

454
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,190
才能让它们撞碎
to smash them together so they'll break?

455
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,450
只需要其中一个从适合的高度落下
We just need to drop one on top of another

456
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:49,430
砸向另一个  这么高就行
from a reasonable height, and, uh... Something like that.

457
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,930
好吧  来试试
Okay, let's try it.

458
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:04,230
降落高度有5.5米
The distance of the drop is about 18 feet,

459
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,190
可以使降落星子模型的速度
which will give the falling asteroid a speed

460
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,060
达到每小时60公里
of 37 miles per hour.

461
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:09,260
再向下一点
Little bit more.

462
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:11,330
很好  很好  就在这里
Perfect. Perfect, right there.

463
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:22,310
好了  瑞安  我准备好了
Okay, Ryan, I'm ready for the drop.

464
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,590
好的  风有些大
Okay, it's pretty windy,

465
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,940
我们看看效果如何
but we'll see how we do.

466
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,170
很好  非常棒
All right! That is excellent.

467
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:49,300
-我觉得很成功  -谢谢
- I would say that's a success. - Oh, thanks.

468
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,310
-很不错  -是啊
- Yeah, that looks good. - Yep.

469
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:53,430
真奇妙  它们都分散开了
That's amazing, how much it's, like, really spread out.

470
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,150
没错  在星子带  这些碎块会
Right, so in the asteroid belt, all these pieces would

471
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,150
因引力作用重新聚合  形成瓦砾堆
gravitate back together and form a rubble pile,

472
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,850
就是现在所说的星子
what we would call an asteroid today.

473
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,030
如果它们一直向一处聚集
So if they're starting to come together all the time,

474
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,670
是不是就同行星形成过程一样
isn't that the same process that actually forms a planet?

475
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:07,260
那为什么行星不是这样形成的呢
Why wouldn't the planet form in that case?

476
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,160
不是的  在那时
Well, no, because then

477
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,320
这些星子一次又一次地遭到撞击
this thing gets hit again and again and again.

478
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,760
受此影响  它们会保持碎裂的状态
So these things keep getting pulverized by impacts,

479
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:16,370
只剩下一些小型的独立的瓦砾堆
and you're just left with little individual rubble piles,

480
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,350
而不是完整的行星
rather than a complete planet.

481
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,320
那这有没有模拟出
Does this reasonably replicate

482
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:23,480
你所认为的星子碰撞的样子呢
what you think possibly an asteroid collision would be?

483
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:25,250
这个模拟效果很成功  事实上
This is a pretty good analogy, in fact,

484
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:26,980
碰撞会产生大碎块  也会有细小粉末
because you get large pieces, you get dust.

485
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:29,190
所以我们认为的星子基本上是
And so what we think are asteroids are basically rubble piles

486
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,350
由大的碎块聚集而成的瓦砾堆
composed of these large pieces put together,

487
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,160
并覆盖在粉尘之中
covered then in dust.

488
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:35,710
所以我觉得你做的很不错
And, uh, and so yeah, I think you did a good job.

489
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,730
这就像是星子刚诞生的样子
This looks like a-- Like a-- The beginnings of an asteroid.

490
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,180
-太好了  真高兴成功了  -没错
- Great. Well, I'm glad it worked. - Right.

491
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,640
在现在的太阳系中并不是只有
The asteroid belt isn't the only region

492
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:51,070
星子带中无法形成真正的行星
in the emerging Solar System where planets fail to form.

493
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:54,520
在太阳系的外缘  
At the outer fringes of the Solar System,

494
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:59,610
另一个小型物体构成的环带正静静运行着
another ring of small objects orbits in frozen silence...

495
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:00,550
柯伊伯带
The Kuiper belt.

亚历克・弗里喷库
加利福尼亚大学  伯克利分校

497
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:05,500
柯伊伯带位于海王星轨道之上和之外
The Kuiper belt is a region at and beyond the orbit of Neptune

498
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:08,790
由岩石和冰体组成
that has a whole bunch of rocky and icy objects.

499
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:10,340
各物体之间相隔很远
Pretty far away from one another.

500
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:13,280
它们永远无法聚集而成一个行星
Now, they were never able to coalesce to form a planet

501
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,790
因为它们彼此间距离太远
because there's just not enough of them close enough together.

502
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:20,370
太阳系诞生后的五千万年
50 million years after the Solar System was born,

503
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:24,580
柯伊伯带和星子带中的物体
both the Kuiper and the asteroid belts have 100 times

504
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:27,010
是它们现在所含物体的一百多倍
more objects in them than they do today.

505
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:31,480
对于包括地球在内的岩石内行星的最终演化
These objects will play a monumentally destructive but vital role

506
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:36,860
这些物体扮演着极具破坏性却又至关重要的角色
in the final evolution of the rocky inner planets, including the Earth.

507
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:47,180
七千五百万年

508
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:43,370
内行星的形成时间
The inner planets take as much as 10 times longer

509
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,610
比冰雪带外的巨行星长十倍
to form than the giant planets outside the snow line.

510
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:52,230
七千五百万年后  这个过程接近完成
After 75 million years, the process is near completion.

511
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,690
距离年轻的太阳约1.5亿公里处
About 93 million miles from the young Sun,

512
00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:01,420
原始地球已达行星大小并处于较稳定轨道上
the proto-Earth has reached planet size in a relatively stable orbit.

513
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:04,530
但是它有个伴行者
But it has a cosmic stalker.

514
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:10,880
确切来说认为早期的地球
It's actually believed that the Earth was, in its early phase,

515
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:17,170
有另一颗原行星相伴  名为忒伊亚
accompanied by another planet, a protoplanet called Theia,

516
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:19,700
的确跟地球的轨道相似
which was actually in a similar orbit to Earth,

517
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:22,870
大致遵循同一路径
essentially following roughly the same path.

518
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:27,550
这对姐妹星以危险的双生形式
For millions of years, the sister planets

519
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:30,310
围绕太阳互相追逐了几百万年
chase each other around the Sun in a dangerous duet.

520
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:32,850
但是即将来到的碰撞
But a clash is coming

521
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,530
将对地球的命运产生巨大的影响
that will have immense consequences for the fate of the Earth.

522
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:46,300
八千万年前巨大气云的塌缩
The making of our Solar System has gone on for 80 million years,

523
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:54,220
八千万年

524
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:50,500
我们太阳系才得以形成
since the collapse of the giant gas cloud that started the process.

525
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,240
内行星已经基本成型
The inner planets have largely taken shape,

526
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:58,600
但是即将孕育生命的地球
but now the Earth, which will one day harbor life,

527
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,840
现正面临夭折和巨变的危险
faces the potential of an early and cataclysmic death.

528
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:05,000
数百万年来
For millions of years,

529
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,800
原行星忒伊亚一直伴地球左右
Earth has been followed by the protoplanet Theia.

530
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:12,060
两颗星球基本在同一轨道运行
The two bodies travel in essentially the same orbit,

531
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:15,360
渐行渐近
gradually coming closer and closer.

532
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:21,600
现在  地球和忒伊亚碰撞一触即发
Now, for Earth and Theia, it's crunch time.

533
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,960
地球忒伊亚的碰撞在太阳系形成早期
The Earth-Theia collision early in the history

534
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:39,410
亚历克・弗里喷库
加利福尼亚大学伯克利分校

535
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,730
一定是件惊人的大事
of the Solar System must have been a spectacular event.

536
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:38,560
一个火星大小的物体撞入地球侧面
A Mars-sized object came in and hit Earth side

537
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:43,340
二者的部分地壳和地幔飞溅入太空
splattering part of the crust and mantle of both objects into space,

538
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:47,120
形成了一个碎片环  月球从此形成
forming a ring of debris from which the moon then formed.

539
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,380
地球在大灾变中幸存
Having survived the cataclysm

540
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:51,940
并得到了一个月球
and gained a moon,

541
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:54,750
作为内太阳系最稳定的行星之一
the Earth settles in as one of the stable planets

542
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,610
地球得以安顿下来
of the inner Solar System.

543
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:02,220
现在我们再来看看气态巨星
The drama now moves back to the gas giants,

544
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,530
它那变换的轨道令太阳系有崩离的危险
whose shifting orbits threaten to tear the Solar System apart.

545
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:16,620
五亿年

546
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,100
五亿年时
At 500 million years old,

547
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,810
太阳系的所有行星都形成了
all of the Solar System's planets have been formed.

548
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:17,290
但是在行星盘中围绕着碎片
But surrounded by debris in the planetary disc,

549
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,940
它们也在活动
they are on the move.

550
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:26,240
查尔斯・比奇曼
美国航天局外部行星科学研究所

551
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,300
随着原行星盘中密度纹的形成
As waves of density formed in the disc

552
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:29,110
行星们几乎就在行星盘的实体纹中冲浪
the planets were almost surfing on the waves of material in the disc itself.

553
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,510
从行星们形成的地方
You're really shuffling the deck completely

554
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:36,510
到你最终见到它们的位置大相近庭
from where planets are formed to where we finally see them.

555
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:41,330
早期的太阳系  最远的三颗行星
In the early Solar System, the three outermost planets,

556
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:45,270
整体比它们今天离太阳近得多
as a group, are closer to the Sun than they are today.

557
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:50,030
海王星的原始轨道位于天王星内侧
And Neptune's original orbit is inside that of Uranus,

558
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,940
与它们当前的位置相反
the reverse of their current position.

559
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:57,470
另外  星子带和库伯带包含的物质
In addition, the asteroid and kuiper belts each

560
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,720
比它们今天要多一百倍
have 100 times more material than they do today.

561
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:05,340
这两个小区域不断地被巨行星
The small bodies of both belts are constantly flung around

562
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:08,380
及其强烈的引力甩动
by the giant planets and their intense gravity.

563
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:13,040
大行星虽然巨大
As massive as they are, the big planets react

564
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,660
但每次作用于某个星子时仍有反作用
every time they toss a planetesimal somewhere else.

565
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:19,760
反作用也许很小  但叠加起来
The reactions may be small, but they add up to

566
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,020
使巨行星的轨道定期转移到新的位置
make the orbits of the giant planets migrate to new positions.

567
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:27,290
早期  外行星倾向于环绕而行
Early on, the outer planets tended to move around quite a bit.

568
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:28,860
它们移动了
They migrated.

569
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,130
现在  土星  天王星和海王星
Now, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune

570
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:34,460
将星子送往太阳
sent planetesimals in toward the Sun.

571
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:37,400
那意味着它们不得不慢慢向外移动
That means they had to generally move outwards,

572
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:41,800
而木星将星子远远地向外抛出
whereas Jupiter flung planetesimals out to very great distances,

573
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,840
甚至抛出太阳系
even ejected them from the Solar System,

574
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:47,130
那意味着木星不得不往里面移
and that means that Jupiter had to move in.

575
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:50,920
什么决定了位置的变换
What determines these in and out movements?

576
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:55,940
基于物理能量守恒定律
They result from a law of physics that says energy is never lost.

577
00:32:56,930 --> 00:33:00,700
当一颗行星弹出一颗星子
When a planet ejects a planetesimal,

578
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:02,180
行星本身就往里移动一点
the planet itself has to move in a little bit,

579
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:04,080
那就是简单的能量交换
and that's simple conservation of energy.

580
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,920
它给了星子大量的能量
It's giving a lot of energy to the planetesimal,

581
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,530
将它倾倒出去
dumping it way out there.

582
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:11,190
那就是说  行星必须向内移动
That means it, the planet, has to move in.

583
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,590
它失去了能量
It loses energy.

584
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:15,150
如果一个轨道运行的物体失去能量  
If an orbiting object loses energy,

585
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:16,680
它的移动速度就会下降
it's not moving as quickly.

586
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:19,270
就是说它降入近一点的轨道
That means it drops to a lower orbit.

587
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:28,120
这个游乐园再现了这种力的作用
The amusement park again illustrates the forces at work--

588
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:31,280
这就是弹弓作用
in this case, the slingshot effect.

589
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:38,210
它是大行星用以推动小物体的一种引力
It's a gravitational boost that large planets can give small objects.

590
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:41,620
在二十世纪七十年代  科学家们
In the 1970s, scientists exploited it

591
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:44,050
将引力开发应用于旅行者号太空船
to accelerate the Voyager spacecraft

592
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:48,440
使其行能走于太阳系外的行星间
as it swung from planet to planet in the outer Solar System.

593
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,980
在地球上  我们可以
Here on Earth we can think of

594
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:55,350
将处于边缘的过山车看作弹弓
the slingshot as a roller coaster over the edge.

595
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:59,130
我们在这里控制的穿梭过山车
The boomerang roller coaster ride that we have here

596
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:03,410
很好地例证了弹弓效应的力
is a nice example of the forces that are involved in the slingshot effect.

597
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:02,810
克利福德・强森
南加利福尼亚大学

598
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:09,170
在地球上  地球引力是作用力
The gravity here makes this work here on Earth, using Earth's gravity.

599
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:14,650
重力把车沿着斜坡拉下来
It pulls down on the cart and it pulls down the slope,

600
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,580
然后车又回到斜坡上
and then the cart goes back up the slope

601
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,810
在沿坡而下的过程中获得了能量
due to the momentum it gained from coming down the slope.

602
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,210
如果我们把木星加入这个系统会怎么样呢
What if we were to add Jupiter to the system?

603
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:29,590
现在  木星的引力一直在把目标往里拉
Now, Jupiter's gravity will still pull the object in,

604
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:32,450
但木星使它围绕自己旋转  
but Jupiter swings it around the planet,

605
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:34,190
它围着木星转了一圈
and it goes around Jupiter.

606
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,580
木星的动作给了它一个额外的反冲
And the motion of Jupiter gives it an extra kick

607
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:41,270
所以它得到了比初始更多的动力
so that it gets more momentum than it came in with

608
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:43,080
弹回到斜坡上  冲入太空
and gets shooting back up the slope and out into space.

609
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,080
七亿年

610
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:51,670
超过五亿年间  数百万小引力
Millions of small gravitational tugs have made subtle changes

611
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:55,340
使行星轨道产生了微妙的变化
to the planetary orbits for more than half a billion years.

612
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,590
地球和其他年轻的行星
Earth and the other young planets

613
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,970
能够处于有利于产生早期生命的环境
may settle into conditions conducive to early life.

614
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:06,180
要是这样  当气态巨星木星和土星
If so, it's about to be wiped out as the gas giants,

615
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:10,750
达到惊人的共振临界点  它就将毁灭了
Jupiter and Saturn, reach a remarkable tipping point called a resonance.

616
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:17,610
麦克・布朗
加利福尼亚理工学院

617
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,920
一旦木星和土星达到共振是很惨烈的
As soon as Jupiter and saturn hit the resonance it was catastrophic.

618
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:18,940
整个太阳系将在一百万年内被崩离
The entire Solar System flew apart in just a million years,

619
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:21,560
相对于太阳系的年纪  这是很短的时间
which is a tiny amount of time, compared to the age of the Solar System.

620
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:25,930
共振意味着土星每绕太阳一周
The resonance means that every time Saturn orbits the Sun once,

621
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:29,720
木星就会绕两周
Jupiter will go around twice.

622
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:33,990
结果是在太阳系的同一位置
The result, Jupiter and Saturn come very close to each other

623
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:36,310
木星和土星有规律地越靠越近
in the same part of the Solar System on a regular,

624
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:40,040
在不断进行的基础上产生巨大的引力泵
ongoing basis, creating an immense gravity pump.

625
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,980
就像给一个小孩荡秋千
It's like pumping a kid on a swing.

626
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:47,130
如果小孩荡秋千时  你推的时候恰到好处
If you hit the kid on the swing at just the right time,

627
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:50,530
你就可以让它越荡越高
you can get the motion to go higher and higher and higher.

628
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:56,480
最巨大的影响  是对两颗最远的巨行星
The most dramatic effect is on the two outermost giant planets.

629
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:03,270
迈克尔・密史纳
美国航天局喷气推进实验室

630
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,790
所有行星都围绕太阳系旋转的时候
As all of the planets were orbiting around the Solar System,

631
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:02,970
彼此引力相互作用
having gravitational interactions with each other,

632
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,730
发生的最惊人事件之一  是天王星
one of the most amazing things that happened is that Uranus and

633
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,710
与海王星对调了位置
Neptune actually switched places.

634
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,790
这就是为什么现在海王星在天王星的外侧
So now Neptune is farther away than Uranus.

635
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,350
这种共振现象会引发灾难
The resonance is a cataclysm

636
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:15,560
而这灾难的影响会以迅雷不及掩耳之势
whose effects sweep through the system

637
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:18,660
波及整个太阳系  它不仅会使行星换位
at astounding speed, not only shifting orbits,

638
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:22,250
而且还会驱赶走太阳系中的大部分小星体
but clearing out most of the system's small objects.

639
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,000
单单是木星自身强大的吸引力
Jupiter alone is quite a gravitational bully

640
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,560
就足以慢慢削减星子带中星体的数量
and gradually depleted the asteroid belt.

641
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,270
而木星与土星共同造就的共振现象
But the Jupiter-Saturn resonance

642
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:36,110
则造成了星子带与库伯带中的星体急剧减少
caused a catastrophic depletion of both the asteroid belt and the Kuiper belt.

643
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:42,070
星子带与库伯带中99%的星体 
99% of the bodies in the asteroid and kuiper belts

644
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,090
都被驱逐出了太阳系
are cleared.

645
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,390
但尽管这绝大多数星体都被驱逐出去了
While most of them are thrown out of the system,

646
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:49,010
有一小部分星体却冲向了木星的轨道内侧
some of them plunge inward.

647
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,590
由于太阳引力的吸引
Drawn by the gravity of the Sun,

648
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:55,130
它们穿越宇宙  直冲向内太阳系
they rip through space toward the inner Solar System.

649
00:36:55,230 --> 00:37:00,600
内太阳系中的行星  如何才能逃脱劫难
How will the inner planets, including the Earth, escape the onslaught?

650
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:13,010
一团巨大的星云开始其塌缩过程之后7亿年
The making of our Solar System reaches a violent climax

651
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:19,520
太阳系的诞生历程达到了其壮丽的高潮
700 million years after the presolar cloud first began to collapse.

652
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,890
而地球则处于火线之上
And Earth is in the firing line.

653
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:30,680
木星与土星引发的引力错乱
The gravitational chaos of Jupiter and Saturn

654
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:34,960
使得小星体不断撞击类地行星及其卫星
is battering the inner Solar System's planets and moons

655
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,390
现在我们称其为"后期重轰炸期"
in an event now known as the late heavy bombardment.

656
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,020
许多外太阳系的星体
A lot of the material in the outter Solar System,

657
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:48,660
迈克尔・密史纳
美国国家航空航天局  喷气推进实验室

658
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,210
这些彗星都飞入内太阳系
these comets fell into the inner Solar System

659
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:50,400
并与类地行星及其卫星发生碰撞
where they collided with the inner planets and the moon,

660
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,730
我们今天见到的陨石坑就是这样形成的
creating the craters that we see today.

661
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,280
一些研究人员认为
Some researchers believe

662
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,290
频繁的撞击使地球一次又一次地生灵涂炭
collisions may have repeatedly sterilized the Earth,

663
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:05,870
如果有生命产生  则因此毁灭
and that if life had formed, it was wiped out...

664
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,180
而不得不又从零开始
And had to start anew.

665
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:15,070
但这从天而降  砸向地球的星体
But the impact of objects from space,

666
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,210
以及随之而来的一番天崩地裂
along with their violence,

667
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:21,810
也可能为地球带来福祉
may have also brought a benefit.

668
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:27,480
地球若非被那些来自外太阳系的星体
The Earth might not have all the water it does today

669
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,890
狂轰滥炸一番
had it not been bombarded by

670
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:30,530
今天的地球上就不会有这么多的水
material from the outer Solar System.

671
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:31,890
一些科学家推测
Some have speculated

672
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:33,690
今天我们地球上的很多水
that much of the water we have on Earth

673
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:35,390
其实都是"后期重轰炸期"时
is actually a result of impacts

674
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:37,170
对地球狂轰滥炸的那些星体带来的
from the late heavy bombardment period.

675
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:48,490
在距离太阳系的诞生46亿年的今天
Today, 4.6 billion years after the Solar System's birth,

676
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:54,440
但巨型星子撞击地球的隐患依然存在
the ongoing if remote danger of a massive asteroid strike

677
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:56,430
而这意味着  我们尚不能高枕无忧
means the story is not over.

678
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,140
我们更应该关注的是
More important, though,

679
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:01,580
那上百颗坠落在地球上
are the hundreds of tiny asteroids

680
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,470
成为陨石的微型星子
hitting the planet as meteorites.

681
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,400
通过对这些陨石的分析研究
Studying them tells us

682
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,890
我们便可以了解到太阳系的形成过程
if the making of the Solar System

683
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,860
是否正如我们想象的那样
really happened when and how we think it did.

684
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,490
这块石头是从艾伦德陨星采下的样本
I'm holding a sample of the Allende meteorite.

685
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:18,560
艾德・杨
加州大学洛杉矶分校

686
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,670
艾伦德陨星是一块于1969年陨落在
The Allende meteorite is a fragment of rock

687
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:19,870
墨西哥艾伦德村附近的岩石
that fell in Mexico near the village of Allende in 1969.

688
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,170
这块陨石的组成部分包括了
One of the components of the meteorite

689
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:24,520
这些富含钙元素与铝元素的杂质
are these calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions,

690
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:26,560
就是这些在其表面的白色物质
these white objects that you can see on the surface.

691
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,620
我们通过放射性同位素测试得知
These are the oldest known materials in the Solar System,

692
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:33,700
它们是太阳系中已知的最古老物质
and we know this by age dating with radiogenic isotopes.

693
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:38,460
在加州大学洛杉矶分校的高科技试验室里
In his high-tech lab at UCLA,

694
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,780
天体化学家艾德・杨和他的同事们
cosmochemist Ed Young and his colleagues

695
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:45,630
在对古老陨石的小样本进行仔细的化验
carefully examine tiny samples of ancient meteorites.

696
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:48,580
样本中部有一块很大的白色杂质
There's a big white fragment in the middle

697
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:49,880
我们需要把它切割出来
which we want to cut out.

698
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:56,210
用试验室中精密的激光仪器对准这块杂质
The lab's precision lasers aim at the fragments,

699
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:59,690
在陨石上烧灼出一个个头发那么细的小孔
blasting out holes no wider than a human hair.

700
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:04,740
研究人员仔细地分析测量其中的放射性元素
Sophisticated analysis measures radioactive elements,

701
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:07,320
这些放射性元素可以告诉我们其年代
which serve as atomic clocks.

702
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:13,250
2011年初  在亚利桑那州立大学
In early 2011, cosmochemists in a similar lab

703
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,770
一个类似的试验室  那里的天体化学家
at Arizona State University

704
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:17,470
精确地测定出一块在北非发现的陨石
dated part of a north African meteorite

705
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:22,300
产自四十亿六千八百二十万年前
to an incredibly accurate 4.5682 billion years old,

706
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,870
迄今已来是在地球上发现的最古老的物质
the oldest material ever found on earth,

707
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:28,530
甚至比地球自己的年龄还要大
older than the planet itself.

708
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:33,700
2011年8月
In August 2011,

709
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,520
"黎明号"探测器到达了
the Dawn spacecraft arrived

710
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,230
星子带  大多数陨石都来自于此
in the asteroid belt, source of most meteorites.

711
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:41,840
探测器接近了第二大星子  灶神星
Close-up pictures of Vesta,

712
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,870
并拍下了特写镜头
the second largest asteroid,

713
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:45,070
从此  人们对太阳系诞生史的研究
open a new epoch

714
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:47,440
翻开了新的一页
in telling the Solar System's story.

715
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,350
"黎明号"执行的任务十分令人兴奋
One of the exciting things about the Dawn Mission

716
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:53,090
麦克・布朗
加利福尼亚理工学院

717
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:52,260
因为这是我们第一次得以目睹
is that we're gonna get our first glimpse into something

718
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:55,150
这个恰恰与太阳系
that was essentially a mini-planet that was formed

719
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:57,230
同时诞生的星子
right at the beginning of the Solar System.

720
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:02,530
自其于太阳系初期诞生以来
Since its birth early in the Solar System's history,

721
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:06,490
灶神星就没怎么经历过风吹雨打
Vesta has been undisturbed by weather

722
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:08,430
也未受到什么地质作用力的影响
or many of the geologic forces

723
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:10,410
不像其他行星饱受风雨和地壳运动的摧残
that have changed the planets over time.

724
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:14,150
与其他的大行星一样  灶神星也有火山
Just like some of the larger planets, it has volcanoes.

725
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,050
它也有内核
It has a core.

726
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:16,530
但与其他的大行星不同的是
But unlike these larger planets,

727
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:18,330
在过去的四十五亿年中
not much else has happened to it

728
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,740
它的表面并没怎么受到其他外力的影响
in the past four and half billion years.

729
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:22,340
借助对灶神星勘测
So we essentially get a window back into

730
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:24,650
我们得以研究太阳系刚刚诞生时的情况
that very earliest history of the Solar System.

731
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,770
"黎明号"将围绕灶神星运转一年
Dawn will orbit Vesta for a year

732
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:29,910
随后它将前往最大的星子  谷神星
before going on to spend another year

733
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:33,380
并围绕它运转一年的时间
orbiting the largest asteroid, Ceres.

734
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,320
与此同时  航空航天局的"朱诺"探测器
Meanwhile, NASA's Juno probe

735
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,520
也将开始其前往木星的旅程
has just begun its voyage to Jupiter,

736
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:46,410
它造访这颗巨行星的任务是
where it will visit the giant planet

737
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:49,370
探测出它到底有没有固态的内核
to determine if it really does have a solid core

738
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:51,310
如果有  那个内核是否像科学家想象的
and formed early and quickly,

739
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:53,560
是在木星诞生初期迅速形成的
as scientists now believe.

740
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:57,990
而更加值得我们留意的
Even more crucial are other stars

741
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:59,480
是那些同样拥有自己太阳系的恒星
with their own solar systems,

742
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,690
其形成过程有助于我们了解自己的太阳系
whose formation sheds essential light on our own.

743
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,710
我们之所以要了解太阳系的形成过程
The most important reason for understanding

744
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:06,860
其中最重要的原因就是
how the Solar System was made

745
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,390
我们想知道太阳系的存在是否寻常
was to find out whether or not we're normal.

746
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,700
当你用人们现在造出的天文望远镜
When you look out and look at other solar systems

747
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,590
向太空眺望  寻找其他太阳系
being made with our telescopes today,

748
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:14,580
比如但你放眼猎户座星云或是其他地方
for example in Orion and other places,

749
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,530
你的心中可能会有这样的疑问
we want to answer the question,

750
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:18,450
"太阳系的存在究竟有多普遍"
"How normal is this solar system?"

751
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,650
于2009年开始执行的开普勒任务
Launched in 2009, the Kepler mission

752
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:28,140
现在正如火如荼地进行着
is now running full-blast

753
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,210
到目前为止  它已甄别出了
and has identified

754
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:32,470
1200个可能围绕其他恒星公转的行星
1,200 possible planets around other stars.

755
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:37,900
一些行星系统中会出现木星那么大的行星
Some systems have Jupiter-sized planets

756
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:40,640
它们靠近系中的恒星运转或是偏向运转
close to their suns or in lopsided orbits.

757
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:44,550
还有一些行星系统中只有小号的行星
Others have only small planets

758
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:47,350
它们紧密聚集在那颗恒星能照射到的地方
crowded closely in the hot zone of their stars.

759
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,150
然而  我们的太阳系却与众不同
Our Solar System, however,

760
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:56,940
太阳系中的行星轨道都接近圆形
has its planets in near-circular orbits,

761
00:42:58,290 --> 00:42:59,850
一环一环稳定地排列着
spread out in a stable arrangement

762
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:02,360
这看上去简直是过于完美了
that seems almost too perfect.

763
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:05,300
在过去十年中  当我们不断发现那些
One of the great surprises of the last decade

764
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:12,720
查尔斯・比奇曼
美国国家航空航天局系外行星科学研究中心

765
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:08,300
太阳系外行星系统时  最令人吃惊的是
as we started to discover other planetary systems

766
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:13,670
我们的太阳系似乎是个怪胎
was the fact that our Solar system seems to be one of the odd balls.

767
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:16,880
这主要是因为太阳系太规律了
Mostly because our own Solar System is so regular.

768
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:20,950
太阳系的形成过程是否与
Is the Solar System made by processes

769
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:23,030
今日其他行星系统形成相同
that we can observe going on today,

770
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:25,280
又或者  我们的太阳是独一无二的
or are we somehow special?

771
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:27,350
这又引出了另一个问题
This goes to the point of

772
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:29,210
即地球上的生命是否是独一无二的
whether or not life is special.

773
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,070
这恐怕是所有问题中
And that question is perhaps

774
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,650
最重要的一个了
the most important one of all

775
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:40,960
因为对太阳及其行星的生命历程的探寻
as the life story of the sun and its planets

776
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:44,880
归根结底是探寻生命本身的历程
essentially becomes the lifestory of life itself.

777
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:48,970
地球上的人类以及地球本身
Humanity on Earth, and our ultimate place.

778
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:53,660
在茫茫宇宙中  是否只此一例
Alone or among many in the universe.
