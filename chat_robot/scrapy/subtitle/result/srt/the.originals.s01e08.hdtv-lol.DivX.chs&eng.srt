00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:03,080
我和哥哥们是有史以来最古老的吸血鬼
My brothers and I are the first vampires,

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:05,130
也就是...始祖家族
in all of history-- the originals.

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:08,290
三百年前 新奥尔良城是我们的家园
300 years ago, we called New Orleans home.

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:12,530
曾经有一段时间 我在这里很快乐
I was happy here...for a time.

现在我重新回来 却发现一个奇迹
Now we've returned, only to find a miracle...

7
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,350
Niklaus 这个女孩怀着你的孩子
Niklaus, the girl is carrying your child.

因为这个 我们有了新的责任
And with it, a new responsibility...

10
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,760
我会永远保护你
I will always protect you.

11
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:24,450
我向你保证
You have my word on that.

但我们家族有很多敌人
But our family has many enemies.

14
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,610
Klaus毁了我生命中一切美好的东西
Klaus destroyed everything good in my life.

15
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,530
所以我要拿走他最想要的
So I'm gonna take away the thing he wants most.

16
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,760
这些威胁本应该让我们团结起来
These threats should have united us.

17
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
时间轴:  Jer-Knigんt

18
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,550
然而Klaus却将我们分离
Instead, Klaus has driven us apart.

19
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,160
在你对Elijah做出那种事之后
Why should I help you

20
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,670
我为什么还要帮你？
after what you did to Elijah?

21
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
监制:  杨逍

22
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:38,740
因为你是我的家人
You're my family.

23
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,290
Klaus永远不会停止对你的控制
Klaus will never stop trying to control you.

24
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:42,740
你想要的是什么？
What do you want?

25
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,300
一千年以来我哥哥希望我忠于他
My brother expects my loyalty,

26
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,750
一如既往的 但现在 也许
as he has for 1,000 years, but now, perhaps,

27
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,410
是时候做出另一个选择了
it's time to make another choice.

28
00:00:58,510 --> 00:00:59,920
我根本就不应该回到这里
I should never have come back here.

29
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,990
这是我坠入爱河的城市
This is the town where I fell in love

30
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,470
也是我们对爱失望的城市
and where love failed us.

31
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,610
我猜你知道我在说谁
I assume you know who I'm talking about.

32
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:11,190
你应该知道 我和Marcel
You should know, Marcel and I

33
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,720
现在关系不是很好
aren't on the best of terms right now.

34
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,550
但你是个称职的神父 不是吗
But you are an active priest, are you not,

35
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,790
准备好听我的忏悔了吗？
ready and able to hear my confession?

36
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,390
通常情况下 “愿意”
Usually, the word "Willing"

37
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,740
会出现在这个句子里
falls somewhere in that sentence.

38
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,370
你连天主教徒都不是吧？
Are you even Catholic?

39
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,030
我已经活了1000年了
I've been on this earth for 1,000 years.

40
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:30,720
我不能确切地说我信仰上帝什么的
I can't say for certain that I believe in anything like a god,

41
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,870
但我需要得到宽恕
but I need absolution

42
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,580
不管是谁的 谁都可以
from someone, anyone.

43
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:41,810
所以你愿不愿意听我的忏悔呢？
So will you hear my confession or not?

44
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:49,310
神父 请原谅我的罪行
Bless me, father, for I have sinned.

45
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,040
我是一个骗子 一个叛徒
I am a liar, a betrayer.

46
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,650
我密谋策反我的血亲
I have conspired against my own blood,

47
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,990
我甚至怀疑上帝也不能拯救我
and I doubt even your god could save me.

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

52
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,950
24小时前

53
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,410
你今天和我们的好朋友Marcel聊天了吗？
Have you spoken to our good friend Marcel today?

54
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:22,960
没有 我应该说些什么吗？
No. Should I have?

55
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,910
他最近安静得有些奇怪
Well, he's been mysteriously silent,

56
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,680
有意无意地躲着我
avoiding me, some might say.

57
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,450
我想 他在你们卿卿我我的时候
I thought, perhaps, he may have whispered

58
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,160
可能对你
reasons into your ear

59
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:34,150
说过什么悄悄话
along with all of those sweet nothings.

60
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,570
如果我看到他了 一定会问问
If I see him, I'll be sure to ask

61
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:36,950
他是否还生你的气
if he's still sore at you.

62
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,280
让我给你的眼神做个解释吧
Let me give a voice to that look in your eyes.

63
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,360
我儒雅高尚的哥哥被混蛋的哥哥咬伤了
My saintly, noble brother lies writhing

64
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,570
正痛苦地躺在河口的小屋
in agony in the bayou,

65
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,880
垂死挣扎
victim of my bastard brother's bite

66
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,200
虽然只要一两滴他的血
when just one or two drops

67
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,400
就能缓解他的疼痛
of his blood would ease his pain.

68
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,680
恰恰相反 Nik
One the contrary, Nik.

69
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,510
我很享受边吃早餐
I am simply enjoying my brekkie

70
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,050
边等着Elijah健康回来
waiting for Elijah's healthy return.

71
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,310
得了吧 Rebekah
Oh, come on, Rebekah.

72
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,400
你整个早上都恶狠狠地盯着我
You've been giving me the devil's eye all morning.

73
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:02,520
你就承认吧
Out with it.

74
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,800
也许我只是在担心 万一我评价了
Perhaps I'm concerned that if I voice my opinion

75
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,610
你对Elijah的所作所为 
about what you did to Elijah, I will end up

76
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,770
弄不好也会挨你咬一口
on the wrong side of your toxic hybrid teeth.

77
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,170
胡说八道 我永远不会咬你
Poppycock. I would never bite you.

78
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,120
Elijah对我做了过分的谴责
Elijah made some very offensive accusations

79
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,960
居然说我对自己的孩子居心叵测
about my intentions towards my child.

80
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,500
他活该难受这么一两天
He deserves a day or two of discomfort.

81
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,680
而且 你知道我更喜欢
Besides, you know my preferred method

82
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,700
用什么来惩罚你的轻率之举
of punishment for your indiscretions

83
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,910
匕首
is the dagger.

84
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,610
你从根本上就有问题
There's something fundamentally wrong with you.

85
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,340
来 喝了它 
Here. Drink this.

86
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,330
请原谅我
Forgive me, please.

87
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:01,420
没关系
It's ok.

88
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,770
提醒我 一等你恢复过来
Remind me to annihilate your brother

89
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,040
就去灭了你的弟弟
once you're healthy.

90
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,280
好 记得提醒我告诉你
Yes. Remind me to remind you

91
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,510
得先排队挂个号
to get in line.

92
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,830
我们要留在这个沼泽地
Doesn't help that we decided to shack up

93
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,690
也无济于事
in the middle of a swamp, either.

94
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:22,680
-你还好吗？  -我很好
-Are you ok?  -I'm fine.

95
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,280
请继续读书吧
Please just return to your reading.

96
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,840
我浏览了整本书
Well, I went through the whole thing.

97
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,910
这只是本普通的圣经
It's just a regular bible

98
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,200
里面记录了一个族谱而已
with an entry in the family tree

99
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,720
那个名字也不一定是我
that may or may not be me,

100
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,370
但你知道我还是一直
but you know I've been a little busy

101
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:38,520
都在担心你
worrying about you.

102
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,530
Hayley 别这样 
Hayley, please.

103
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:41,370
这种高烧会让我情绪很不稳定
This fever will make me unstable.

104
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,070
一旦开始出现幻觉
Now, once these hallucinations begin,

105
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,190
我会看到幻象
I'll start to see things.

106
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,140
然后胡言乱语
I will start to say things.

107
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:49,000
你必须让我一个人待在这里
You must leave me here.

108
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:50,750
我不会在这种情况把你留下的
I'm not leaving you like this.

109
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:26,240
我来了 我们开始吧
All right. I'm here. Let's do this.

110
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,220
我会长话短说
I'll keep this simple.

111
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,820
这孩子是你最爱的Klaus的一个宿敌
This kids is an old enemy of your favorite person Klaus.

112
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,370
现在 他有话要说
Now, he's got plenty to say

113
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,640
关于那个叛逆不忠的贱人
about what that traitorous

114
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,930
都瞒着我干了些什么
son of a bitch has been up to behind my back.

115
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,570
现在 胆小的人
Now, for those of you faint of heart,

116
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:47,860
门在那边 因为只要留下
there's the door because those who stick around,

117
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,580
就要参加战斗
you're signing up for battle.

118
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,130
众所周知 Klaus不会一直都是混血的状态
You all know Klaus wasn't always the hybrid.

119
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,500
当他打破他狼人的休眠诅咒时
When he broke the curse that kept his werewolf side dormant,

120
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,110
在某个方面
somewhere in all that,

121
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:07,060
就抑制了他的吸血鬼的一面
certain parts were now able to trump his vampire side,

122
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,110
比如能传递狼人的基因
like the ability to pass on the werewolf gene.

123
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,750
这就要说起他一直背着你们带着的那个狼女
That's where the werewolf girl he's been hiding from you all comes in.

124
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,060
她来到我住的小镇 装作是我的朋友
She rolled through my town, pretended to be my friend,

125
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,780
结果却和他勾搭在了一起
and ended up hooking up with him.

126
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,410
现在 她怀了他的孩子
Now she's pregnant with his kid.

127
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:22,890
怎么可能？
What the hell is this?

128
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:23,960
听着就好
Just listen.

129
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,810
当Klaus变成混血后
When Klaus became the hybrid,

130
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,200
他找到了方法让纯种狼人
he figured out a way to turn full-bred werewolves

131
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,780
变成像他一样的混血
into creatures like him.

132
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,650
我就是他们之中的一个
You're looking at one of them.

133
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,110
我们的优势是 拥有吸血鬼的所有能力
On the plus side, we had all the perks of being vampires.

134
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,460
还更强壮 更敏捷
We were stronger, faster,

135
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:42,660
我们咬人时分泌出的毒素依然可以杀死吸血鬼
and the toxins in our bites could still kill a vampire,

136
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:44,830
但劣势是 我们都效忠于他
but on the downside, we were loyal to him,

137
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,970
是非主动的忠诚
like, supernaturally loyal.

138
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,840
哦 这就是你在这里泄露他秘密的原因？
Right, and that's why you're here spilling all his secrets?

139
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,840
不 这就是重点 Diego
No. That's the point, Diego.

140
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,190
他找到了一个方法恢复自由
He figured out a way to break free of it.

141
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,910
我后来也帮助其他人这样
And I helped the rest of them, too.

142
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,720
但因为他们背叛了Klaus 他把他们都杀掉了
Then Klaus killed them for their betrayal.

143
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,560
因为Klaus容不下背叛
Because that is what Klaus does.

144
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:09,480
别介意
Don't mind me.

145
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,270
我只是被这故事吸引了
I'm fascinated by this story.

146
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,560
-嗨 Tyler  -Rebekah
-Hello, Tyler.  -Rebekah.

147
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,270
好久不见
Long time no see.

148
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,300
Tyler想跟你们说的是
What Tyler is about to tell you

149
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,490
我哥哥可以利用他孩子的血
is that my brother can use his baby's blood

150
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:22,190
来让更多的混血认祖归宗
to sire more hybrids.

151
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,260
而且吸血鬼根本没有胜算
What you will all figure out is that vampires don't stand a chance.

152
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,660
所以 Tyler 我猜你接下来正打算团结这些人
So, Tyler, I assume you were trying to rally this lot

153
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,600
确保这个孩子不会出生
into making sure the baby isn't born.

154
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,870
没错
Yeah.

155
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,010
你要不喜欢 可以站在你哥哥那边
You don't like it, go ahead and take your brother's side,

156
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:39,200
但是你知道 我是对的
but you know I'm right.

157
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,840
我相信你误解了这位女士的本意
I believe you've mistaken the lady's intentions.

158
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:43,650
那现在是什么情况？
All right. What's going on?

159
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:45,630
你是对的 Tyler
You're absolutely right, Tyler.

160
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,800
我哥哥是一个极品混蛋
My brother is a crap enough individual as it is.

161
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,520
不能再让他制造一群更优越的物种群
The last thing he needs is to sire a superior species.

162
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,970
来吧 你帮我说两句好话
Go on. You can tell them.

163
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,350
她不是来踢馆的
She's not here to fight us.

164
00:07:58,570 --> 00:07:59,970
她是来帮我们的
She's here to help us.

165
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,910
没错 但是首先...
That's right, but first--

166
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,070
唔 要伤害婴儿的话题就说到这吧
whew, that is enough talk about harming that baby.

167
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,300
Klaus才是我们要制止的人
Klaus is the one we're putting a stop to.

168
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:27,440
他们都抛弃了我
They have all forsaken me.

169
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,000
我的兄弟姐妹和我父母一样
My siblings are as deceitful and diseased

170
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,030
虚伪而又病态
as my parents ever were,

171
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:37,830
指责我为了一己之私利用自己的血脉
accusing me of using my baby for my own gain,

172
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:42,050
宁愿相信别人也不相信自己的血亲
trusting others before their own blood.

173
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,980
哦 给我用个笔记本你能死吗？
Ohh, would a laptop kill you?

174
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,180
那台打印机给海明威用都绰绰有余了
That typewriter was good enough for Hemmingway.

175
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,560
你们的确有相似之处...
Can see the resemblance--

176
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,460
酗酒和胡乱施暴
Booze and random acts of violence.

177
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,060
Elijah和Rebekah的恶毒谎言
Elijah and Rebekah have cut to the quick

178
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,190
深深地刺痛了我
with their vicious lies about me

179
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:56,000
我所做的一切都是为了赢得这场战斗
when all I've done is tried to win

180
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,290
为了从Marcel手里接过控制权
this battle of wills over Marcel's control

181
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:01,910
重新要回我们的家
of the quarter in order to reclaim our home.

182
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,180
请继续打
Type, please.

183
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,320
重点是什么？
What's the point?

184
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,280
你只是不断地在重复着相同事情
You just repeat the same thing over and over again.

185
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,240
Rebekah要背叛你 Elijah要扳倒你
Rebekah is out to get you. Elijah is out to get you.

186
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:12,760
有没有人不想置你于死地呢？
Is there anyone who isn't plotting your downfall?

187
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,710
我怀疑你只信赖自己的影子
I doubt you trust your own reflection.

188
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:16,270
如果匕首没有消失
If the daggers weren't missing,

189
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,400
我肯定会在他俩心口上一人插一把
I would put one in each of their hearts,

190
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:22,870
让他们消停几个世纪 我也好耳根清净
rid myself of the burden of my siblings for a couple of centuries.

191
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,190
看看你自己
Look at you,

192
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,610
一次又一次地进入了 相同的破坏性周期 
repeating the same destructive cycles over and over again.

193
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:32,330
你亲手造就了你的不幸
You are the architect of your own unhappiness.

194
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:35,090
我不记得我是来问你意见的
I don't remember asking for your advice.

195
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,600
哦真的吗？
Oh, really?

196
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:38,070
新奥尔良里有这么多人
So of all the people in New Orleans,

197
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,120
你偏选了一个有心理学硕士学位的人
you choose someone with a master's in psychology

198
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,900
去记录你的人生传记
to record your life story.

199
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,130
你都一千多岁了
You're over 1,000 years old.

200
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:44,990
肯定知道怎么打字啊
Pretty damn sure you know how to type.

201
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,710
真相是 你用意念操控我来这里
The truth is, you compel me to come here

202
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,520
因为没人可以倾诉
because you have no one else to talk to,

203
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,400
而你想要被人理解
and you want to be understood.

204
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,630
然后你再控制我 让我一离开你
Then you compel me to forget everything

205
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,570
就忘记所有事情
as soon as I leave your presence

206
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:55,480
因为你太害怕 没法信任别人
because you're too scared to trust.

207
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,490
我什么都不怕
I am scared of nothing.

208
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,520
这是什么？
What is this?

209
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,120
是个古老的神秘图绘 我要用它摧毁你
It's an ancient, mystical plot I’m using to destroy you.

210
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,940
放轻松 这是个纹身设计
Relax. It's a tattoo design.

211
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,490
你用自己的时间画画吧
Draw on your own time.

212
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,410
这就是我自己的时间 是你强占了
This is my time. You steal it from me.

213
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,560
你打算把他放在哪儿？
Where do you want him?

214
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,110
把他放在一边就好
Well, just put him anywhere handy

215
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:32,030
直到处理掉Klaus
until Klaus is taken care of.

216
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:34,880
我们要把Klaus放在哪儿？
Where are we gonna put Klaus?

217
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,700
他得离其他人远些
He needs to be away from all the others.

218
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,900
我们可不想让他再惹出什么事情
We don't want him fomenting descent.

219
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,180
你懂得 他很会说花言巧语
You know he has a knack with words.

220
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,750
很有可能凭嘴皮子就能逃出去
He could talk his way out of hell.

221
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,060
是啊 所以我在后面给他选了个地方
Yeah. I got a spot picked out for him in the back.

222
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,630
在未来的五十二年里他唯一可以对话的
Only person he's gonna be talking to

223
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,920
就是他自己
for the next 52 years is himself.

224
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,170
五十二年？
52?

225
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:55,280
因为他在十九世纪的时候用匕首封印了你五十二年
One for each year that he kept you daggered in the 1800s.

226
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:57,790
你指你任由他捅我的那次
You mean, you let him keep me daggered.

227
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:03,870
Klaus在这里的每一年 我都会向你道歉的
And I'll spend every year Klaus is in here apologizing to you for it.

228
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,500
那我得花足够的时间
Well, I'll settle for long enough

229
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,720
去体验一下这小小的快乐了
to experience just a little bit of happiness

230
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,430
还得保证我的侄女不会变成
and ensure that my niece isn't turned

231
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,370
一个繁殖混血的机器
into a hybrid breeding machine.

232
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,680
要把他困在这里很难
It's gonna be tough to keep him in here.

233
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,680
你那个小女巫
That little witch of yours

234
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,430
会增加我们成功的可能性的
would put the odds in our favor.

235
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:19,880
我不能冒这个险
I can't risk it.

236
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,870
最近她的魔法越来越失控
She's got less and less control over her magic lately.

237
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,570
我甚至都不能让她离开教堂阁楼
I can't even get her out of the church attic,

238
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:27,360
更不能指望依赖她去对付Klaus
much less rely on her to go to battle against Klaus.

239
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,180
那我们就需要你最厉害的战士了
Then we'll need your very best warriors.

240
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,050
Klaus强大又狡猾
Klaus is strong and crafty,

241
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:34,610
背叛会让他更加怒不可遏
and betrayal makes him particularly nasty.

242
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,850
我们对Klaus所做的
What we're doing is nothing Klaus

243
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:41,200
都是他对你和你哥哥做过的
hasn't done to both you and your brother

244
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,710
还做了很多次
a dozen times over.

245
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,740
你现在不会是在动摇吧？
You're not getting second thoughts now, are you?

246
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:48,030
不 不是动摇
No. These aren't second thoughts.

247
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,380
只是很后悔
They're feelings of regret.

248
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:55,310
我几百年前就应该把他埋了的
I should've buried him a hundred years ago.

249
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:58,840
这一百年的时间我们本来可以一直在一起的
It's a hundred years we could've been together.

250
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,160
没事了 没事了
It's ok. It's ok.

251
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:33,100
哦 Celeste
Oh, Celeste.

252
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:46,680
Hayley 对不起
Hayley, I'm sorry.

253
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,120
我把你当成别人了
I thought you were someone else.

254
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,050
-Celeste？ -是的
- Celeste? - Yes.

255
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,290
不管她是谁 真的好性感
Whoever she was, she was smoking hot.

256
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,140
怎么...
How--

257
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,080
我让你进入我的思想了？
Did I let you enter my thoughts?

258
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:02,000
我不舒服 该走了
I'm not well. I should go.

259
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,840
-这真是... -没事的
- This is-- - This is fine.

260
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:09,200
Elijah 你病了 我在照顾你
Elijah, you're sick. I'm taking care of you.

261
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,080
有人监视我们
We're being watched.

262
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,780
哦 天啊 我没办法习惯
Oh, man, I'll never get used to that.

263
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,930
为什么我总觉得你学过戏剧呢？
Why do I get the feeling you studied theater?

264
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:58,550
这整个世界就是一个舞台 小Joshua
All the world's a stage, young Joshua,

265
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,660
巧的是我在你一生中
and it just so happens I have

266
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,850
都是个举足轻重的角色
the role of a lifetime for you.

267
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:11,960
有什么消息么 Josh？
What do you got, Josh?

268
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,430
我有什么消息？！
What do I got?

269
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:17,570
Klaus想让我从你这儿偷一把什么匕首
Klaus wants me to steal some dagger from you.

270
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:18,810
这是个测试 好吗？
It's a test, ok?

271
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:20,460
他知道我在帮你们做事了 我确定一定以及肯定
He knows I'm working for you. I'm sure of it.

272
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,290
那混蛋又想封印我们了
That bastard wants to dagger us again.

273
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:24,300
他活该遭报应
He deserves everything he's gonna get.

274
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:25,930
放松
Relax.

275
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:28,700
如果他知道了 这会儿你早就被撕成两半了
If he knew, he would've ripped out your spine through your nose by now.

276
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,150
哦 真棒
Oh, great.

277
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,930
现在我感到彻底轻松了
Now I feel totally at ease.

278
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:32,970
那我该怎么做？
What am I supposed to do?

279
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,820
告诉他到处都翻了个底朝天
You tell him you searched high and low

280
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,110
但就是没找到匕首
but you couldn't find the dagger.

281
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,590
哦 天爷 我死定了
Oh, god, I'm so dead.

282
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:40,250
然后你告诉他说 你看到过我随身带着它
Then you tell him you saw I had it on me,

283
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,220
如果他想要 就得亲自来取
that if he wants it, he'll have to come and get it,

284
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,450
这可不容易 因为我很多疑
which won't be easy because I'm paranoid

285
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,110
而且还增强了我队伍的力量
and I beefed up my posse.

286
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,730
好吧 我不是在怀疑你身为
All right. So, not doubting

287
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:51,230
疯狂吸血鬼能毁灭一切的本事
your mad vampire skills of destruction or anything,

288
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,020
但Marcel已经提高了警惕
but Marcel is on red alert,

289
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,560
组了一支军队保护他
surrounded by, like, an army.

290
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:58,420
你只是孤军奋战 除非..
You're totally boned unless--

291
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,540
除非什么？
Unless what?

292
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:02,220
我无意中听到他和Diego的争吵
I overheard him arguing with Diego.

293
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:02,860
很显然
Apparently,

294
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,900
他今晚会清理场地 赴个约什么的
he's clearing out the compound tonight for a date or something.

295
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,210
总之Marcel会在那儿
That's where Marcel will be.

296
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,030
待我统治新奥尔良时
When I run New Orleans,

297
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:13,470
我为你准备一枚永恒的日光戒的 Joshua
there will be a permanent daylight ring in it for you, Joshua,

298
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:16,640
作为你效忠真正的王者的赏赐
for services rendered unto your true king.

299
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:19,610
好极了
Cool.

300
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:26,330
但如果你胆敢背叛我
But if you ever betray me,

301
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:29,420
我保证你无尽的生命将活在极端的痛苦中
I will make sure you spend the rest of your eternal life

302
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:33,880
最后只求一死
in exquisite agony wishing for a merciful death.

303
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,570
永别了 Klaus[西语]
Adios, Klaus.

304
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,380
你想要什么？
What do you want?

305
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,000
这是Poi tin
It's Poi tín.

306
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:08,700
它能让人起死回生
It'd raise the dead,

307
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,670
杀了他们 再把他们复活
kill them, and raise them again.

308
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:19,900
我想谈谈你的侄女Camille
I'd like to talk to you about your niece Camille.

309
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,860
我知道你根据她记忆力的空隙
I'm sure you suspect this already

310
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,620
就会怀疑
by the gaps in her memory.

311
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,780
是我用意念控制了她
I compeled her.

312
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,670
起初是因为 她是个有用的间谍
At first, it was because she was a useful spy

313
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:32,000
但现在是为了保护她
but now for her own protection.

314
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,110
我一直觉得有个吸血鬼在扰乱她的心智
I assumed a vampire was messing with her mind,

315
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:37,430
尽管我没预料到你会供认不讳
though I never anticipated a confession.

316
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,010
但她不会这么轻易放下心结的
She won't leave things be.

317
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:41,480
她胞弟在教堂里大开杀戒
Her mind churns with the permutations

318
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:42,810
这一幕
of what happened in this church

319
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,680
在她的脑海里不断上演
when her twin when on his slaughter spree.

320
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,180
现在 如果她知道了这些事情的真相
Now, if she finds out what really happened,

321
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,180
知道了关于吸血鬼和女巫的魔法的事情
that the vampires and witch hexes were involved,

322
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:53,740
那她会深究下去 直到发现真相
she will dig and dig and dig until she digs too deep

323
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,440
为此惹来杀身之祸
and gets herself killed.

324
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,850
新奥尔良会成为她的葬身之地的
New Orleans will be the death of her.

325
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,730
她要离开
She needs to leave,

326
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,220
虽然有点讽刺的意思
and, as ironic as it may seem,

327
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,150
但我认为这应该是她自己的选择
I believe it should be her choice.

328
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:10,990
对 和一个会控制意念的吸血鬼谈论
Yes. It is ironic discussing free will

329
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,970
自由意志什么的确很讽刺
with a mind-controlling vampire.

330
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:17,960
她是个聪明的女人
She's a clever girl.

331
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,710
今早她刚教训了我一顿
She gave me a piece of her mind earlier today.

332
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,200
如果是别人我早就杀掉了
I would've killed others for less.

333
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,950
我在乎她的安危
I care about her survival.

334
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,700
我嗅到了战争的气息
I smell war in the air,

335
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,140
而每一场战争
and with every war,

336
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:34,310
都有无辜的牺牲者 如果他们及时离开
there is the innocent victim who could have been spared

337
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:36,890
原本是可以保住性命的
if they had just walked away.

338
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:40,850
请一定说服她离开新奥尔良
Please convince her to walk away from New Orleans,

339
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:46,450
不然我必须用意念控制她走
or I'll be forced to compel her to go.

340
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:15,010
这位绅士 能过来帮我吗
Assistance, please, good sir.

341
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,690
不 我更愿意站在这个角度欣赏
No. I'm much happier taking in such a wondrous view.

342
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,170
如此令人沉醉
It's perfection.

343
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:25,600
你的兄弟又不安分了
Your brother is again up to no good.

344
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,660
他挑衅贵族们跟他决斗
He's challenging the gentry to duels

345
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,250
好像他们能有公平决斗的机会似的
as though they have any chance of a fair fight.

346
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:34,140
我真厌倦了放弃自己美好的时光
I do grow weary of sacrificing my joy

347
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,240
来给我的弟弟收拾烂摊子了
to temper my brother's mischief.

348
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,820
我敢肯定你可以施个魔法
Surely, you can cast a spell,

349
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:41,420
让他老实一点吧
put him in his place.

350
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:45,040
那恐怕得有100个女巫同时施魔法才能办到了
It will take 100 witches to put him in his place.

351
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,290
而且 他从来只会听你的话
Besides, he only ever listens to you.

352
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:49,220
是
Yes.

353
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:53,070
他真的要学会点规矩了
He certainly needs a little discipline.

354
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,570
也许打屁股是个好办法
Perhaps a spanking of some kind is in order.

355
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,430
我想我需要练习几次 来
I think I shall need some rehearsal. Come.

356
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,900
Hayley 这场高烧...
Hayley, please. This fever.

357
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,890
那些痛苦的回忆如洪水般在我脑中翻滚
My mind is flooded with these tortuous memories.

358
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,120
你应该离开
You have to leave.

359
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,410
你这人怎么这样？
What is your deal?

360
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,740
你不希望有人照顾你吗？
You don't like people taking care of you?

361
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,930
关心别人没好下场
There are consequences for those that care.

362
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,710
我不会让你承受这些的
I will not have you pay that price.

363
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,690
你只是在做中世纪的春梦吧
So you're having weird retro sex dreams.

364
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:35,700
别想了 我会留下的
Get over it. I'm staying.

365
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:40,610
我们的客人怎么样了？
So what about our visitor?

366
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:42,550
她想要什么？
What does she want?

367
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,240
我猜她可能就是
I'm guessing she's the one that

368
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,160
昨晚把这本神秘的圣经放在门外的人
left the mystery bible on the doorstep last night.

369
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,520
如果她那时候能多留一会
Would be nice if she'd stick around

370
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,170
告诉我其中的缘由该多好
long enough to tell me why.

371
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:53,530
Hayley 你来这里是为了搜寻一些你家族的消息
Hayley, you came here to gather information about your family,

372
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:56,570
而不是照顾发烧吸血鬼的保姆
not to play nursemaid to a vampire with a temperature.

373
00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:00,490
去吧 找到她 把你能问到的都问出来
Please...find her. Learn what you can.

374
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:05,400
不 我要留下来
No. I'm staying.

375
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,050
Klaus
Klaus.

376
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:34,340
你一直不接我的电话
You've been avoiding my calls.

377
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,300
我最近火气很大
A little pissed off lately.

378
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,970
待会我会为我的所作所为致以歉意
Apologies for my behavior can come later.

379
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,870
只是你身上有我的东西 我想把它拿回来
You have something of mine. I want it back.

380
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,990
抱歉 我不能这么做
Sorry, but I can't do that.

381
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,200
这是什么意思？
What is this?

382
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,060
为你的所作所为道歉？
Apologies for your behavior?

383
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,150
你从不会道歉的Nik 你只是装一下
You don't apologize, Nik. You just act.

384
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:02,360
我受够了 我们受够了
I've had enough. We have had enough.

385
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:06,860
瞧瞧你自己 终于拥有了
Well, look at you, finally in possession

386
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,740
唯一能扳倒你的东西
of the one thing that can take you down.

387
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:13,580
-感觉如何？ -好极了
- How does it feel? - Great.

388
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,770
原来如此
So this is it.

389
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:31,750
恶魔Klaus已经越线太多了
The evil bastard Klaus has gone too far,

390
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:33,510
所以必须受到惩罚
must be punished.

391
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:36,210
而且 还是由他的亲妹妹施行
And by his own sibling, nonetheless.

392
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,300
美妙如圣经
How positively biblical.

393
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,600
至于你 Marcel
And you, Marcel,

394
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,490
这就是你所谓的生死之战？
is this your idea of a hit?

395
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:48,230
我教你的可比这样微不足道的围捕强得多
I taught you better than this paltry excuse for a takedown.

396
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:54,060
你以为凭这些 就能征服我？
You think you can subdue me with this?

397
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:58,930
不 但我觉得这样就可以
No, but I think I can with this.

398
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:36,950
Celeste...
Celeste...

399
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,550
原谅我
Forgive me.

400
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,490
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

401
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:48,080
准备决斗[法语]
A l'outrance.

402
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:51,300
八 七 六 五[法语]
Huit, sept, six, cinq,

403
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,570
四 三 二 ...[法语]
Quatre, trois, deux--

404
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:02,640
就这水平？
Is that it?

405
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:06,870
这就是新奥尔良最强的枪手？
Is this the best New Orleans has to offer?

406
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:14,680
弟弟 拜托 这太荒唐了
Brother, please. This is high folly.

407
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,290
过去的几周里你已经屠杀了那么多人
Is it not enough that you have slaughtered

408
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:18,020
难道还不够么？
dozens in just these past several weeks?

409
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:18,560
这个嘛...
Well--

410
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,210
城里堆满尸体的流言
Word of a city littered with bodies

411
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,450
会流传出去的
will surely travel the oceans.

412
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:23,640
你想把父亲引来吗？
Do you want to bring our father upon us?

413
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,190
放轻松 哥哥
Relax, brother.

414
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:27,090
我已经放出消息说这些尸体
I've sent rumor that the bodies are a result

415
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:30,710
是女巫们为了寻找血祭的牺牲品而造成的
of the witches seeking blood sacrifice for their rituals.

416
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,860
你干了什么？
You did what?

417
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,040
你忘了Celeste也是
Have you forgotten Celeste is one of those

418
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,290
你诬蔑的那些女巫中的一员么？
that you so recklessly pointed your finger at?

419
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:39,590
谁是Celeste？
Who's Celeste?

420
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:42,120
哦 我想起来了 就是那个你成天围着转的女巫
Oh, yes, the witch you've been knocking around with.

421
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:42,840
别担心
Well, fear not.

422
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,500
妓女就像法语区的老鼠
Harlots are like rats in the quarter.

423
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,780
你随便迈一步就能被一只绊倒
You trip over one every step you take.

424
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,990
你在乎她  这可真是不幸啊
You care about her. Well, that is unfortunate.

425
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:00,420
我听说这会儿他们正在围捕镇上的女巫
I hear they're rounding up the town's witches as we speak.

426
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,470
Elijah？啊！
Elijah? Oh!

427
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:12,530
Niklaus 你这个混蛋 我要杀了你
Niklaus, I'll kill you, you bastard.

428
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,820
Elijah？啊！
Elijah? Aah!

429
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,210
很高兴认识你
Hello to you, too.

430
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:38,010
咱结束这场哑谜游戏吧 怎么样？
Let's end this charade, shall we?

431
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:43,480
新奥尔良的吸血鬼们
Vampires of New Orleans,

432
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:49,160
一定要给我记得 我是个始祖 是个混血儿
do recall that I am an original, a hybrid.

433
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,250
我拥有不死之身
I cannot be killed.

434
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:54,980
永生是一段十分漫长的时光
Eternity is an awfully long time.

435
00:24:55,510 --> 00:25:00,180
你们觉得Marcel还能掌权多久？
How long to you think Marcel will stay in power?

436
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:07,500
假如你们中的一个人帮我离开
What if one of you lot were to release me,

437
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:12,110
并知道这将得到我永生的感恩 会怎么样？
knowing I would be eternally in your debt?

438
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:18,290
哦 我同情那些敢与我对抗的人
Oh, I would pity those of you who dared to cross me.

439
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:19,770
我向你们保证
I can assure you,

440
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:24,980
你们一定会死得无比壮观的
your ends would be spectacular.

441
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:28,710
这是我从一个老朋友那里
To borrow a trick

442
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,590
学来的一个小把戏…
from an old friend...

443
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:38,790
谁能捡起这枚硬币
Whoever picks up this coin

444
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:41,010
谁就能活下来
gets to live.

445
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,700
现在 你们这些壮烈的杂种们
Now, which of you magnificent bastards

446
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,900
谁想跟我一伙呢？
wants to join me?

447
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,700
想要那枚硬币的人
Anyone wants that coin,

448
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,890
向Klaus宣誓效忠吧
pledge allegiance to Klaus,

449
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,950
现在就去
Take it now.

450
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,740
去吧 你们有选择权
Go ahead. The choice is yours.

451
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,520
拿下他
Take him.

452
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:33,870
Marcel！放马过来决一死战吧！
Marcel! Come and finish this!

453
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:35,140
不
No.

454
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:39,670
-捡起硬币 -什么？
- Take the coin. - What?

455
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,040
除非所有人都死了 不然他不会停止的
He won't stop until everyone is dead,

456
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,330
他也会杀了你的
and he will kill you, too.

457
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:46,510
让这一切结束吧 捡起那枚硬币
End this. Pick up the coin.

458
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,730
够了！
Enough!

459
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,970
瞧瞧
Well, well, well.

460
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,590
伟大的Marcel
The great Marcel,

461
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:27,710
自称为新奥尔良国王之人
self-proclaimed king of New Orleans,

462
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,770
正跪在我的面前
bowing before me.

463
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:31,660
给你
There.

464
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:35,210
我向您宣誓我的忠诚
I hereby pledge my allegiance to you.

465
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,330
您现在拥有我王国的钥匙了
You have the keys to my kingdom.

466
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:43,480
它是您的了
It's yours.

467
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,360
我正要回家
I was on my way home,

468
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,380
看见你躲在这里
saw you duck in here,

469
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,290
我就知道你会在这儿
knew exactly where you'd be.

470
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,830
这些恶作剧又来了
This is getting old.

471
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:13,550
这周第二次了
It's the second time this week.

472
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:14,850
是第三次
Third,

473
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:17,520
我前天才把这里擦干净
but I cleaned it off the day before yesterday.

474
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,970
一点用都没有 他们还会这么做的
It's pointless. They'll just do it again.

475
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:22,090
大家需要时间来治愈
Folks need time to heal.

476
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:25,060
Sean杀了无辜的人
Sean killed innocent people.

477
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,940
没有人能这么快摆脱心理阴影
No one is getting over that any time soon.

478
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:31,120
我觉得
I think--

479
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:34,350
我想我要像他一样发疯了
I think I'm losing it like he did.

480
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:38,120
我在口袋里找到了这个
I found this in my pocket.

481
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:42,070
这上面的线条
The lines,

482
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:44,100
是我和Sean小的时候
it's a secret code Sean and I

483
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,900
经常用的秘密代码
used to use when we were kids.

484
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,010
我不记得我画过这个了
I have no memory of drawing it.

485
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:53,070
我不知道哪里出了问题 但总觉得不对劲
Something is not right. I just can't figure it out.

486
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,750
过来 没事的
Come here. Oh...

487
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:04,970
也许你应该离开镇里一阵子了
Maybe you should leave town for a while...

488
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,510
给自己一点时间放松
Give your head some space.

489
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,650
我认识你的院长
I know your dean.

490
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,130
你可以晚一点交论文
You could put your thesis on hold.

491
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:15,470
不行
I can't.

492
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,610
这一定意味着什么
This means something.

493
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,260
只是我还不知道而已
I just don't know what.

494
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:22,290
不是所有的东西都有什么寓意的
Not everything has meaning.

495
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:25,440
有时你要学会放下
Sometimes you just have to let go.

496
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,740
你应该离开新奥尔良
You should leave New Orleans.

497
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:30,000
并不是所有的人都适合在这生活
This town isn't for everybody.

498
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,820
离开吧
Please.

499
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,240
我敢肯定你有很多的疑问
I'm sure you got questions.

500
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,030
也就一千多个吧
Only a thousand of them,

501
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,180
比如你是谁
Like who are you,

502
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,020
为什么跟踪我
why are you following me,

503
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,540
其他人都去了那里
where the hell is everyone,

504
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:47,360
还有 如果书中记载的人
and if the people in this book

505
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,710
真的是我的家人 他们发生了什么？
really are my family, what happened to them?

506
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:51,140
我叫Eve
I'm Eve.

507
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:52,680
我跟踪你是因为
I'm following you because you brought

508
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,450
你把一个始祖吸血鬼带到了狼人的领地
an original to werewolf country,

509
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:56,530
而正是因为这个原因
which is pretty much the same reason

510
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:58,240
其他人都逃走了
why everybody else skedaddled,

511
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,350
如果你想知道
and if you want to know what happened

512
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:01,580
族谱上的人都发生了什么事
to the people in that family tree,

513
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,180
简而言之
summing it up nice and quick,

514
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:06,120
都拜赐于Marcel
Marcel happened.

515
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,540
他做了什么？
What did he do?

516
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:09,220
他杀死了大部分狼人
He killed most of them.

517
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:12,630
后来 为了对付那些
Later, the descendents of the ones

518
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:16,050
幸存者的后代 他迫使一位女巫
who dodged death, he strong-armed a witch

519
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:18,080
对他们下了咒
into putting a curse on them.

520
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,700
什么样的咒语？
What kind of curse?

521
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:23,200
完全颠覆了自然规律 从内部
Swap nature around, inside out,

522
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:26,530
使他们的自然状态变成狼形
made it so their natural state was wolves.

523
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:29,180
只能在满月时才能变回人身
they only turn back human on the full moon.

524
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:32,490
我们因为身上有那枚标记而遭到猎杀
We get hunted by the marks we carry,

525
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,530
就是那枚月牙形的胎记
that crescent moon birthmark.

526
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,000
所以我把自己的那个毁掉了
That's why I got rid of mine.

527
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:39,250
我不想被发现
I didn't want to get found out.

528
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,130
晚上好啊
Good evening.

529
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:47,610
我想你可能
Think I might have

530
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:49,700
有什么东西落在我这里了
something which belongs to you.

531
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:54,040
Elijah 我来处理这个 你还好吗？
Elijah, I've got this. Are you ok?

532
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:55,820
伤口已经愈合 体温也降下来了
The wound had healed, the fever has broken,

533
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:58,660
但是奇怪的是
but for some strange reason,

534
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:03,270
我的背部却依旧有种锐痛挥之不去
I have this sharpened lingering sensation in my back.

535
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:08,970
我必须带他回去了 但是我会回来的 好吗？
I have to get him home, but I'll be back, ok?

536
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,850
我需要知道更多信息
I need to know more.

537
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:12,850
遮好你的印记
Keep that mark covered up.

538
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,170
发生什么事了？
What happened?

539
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:27,180
我刚只是见到了我的家人
I just met part of my family.

540
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:09,050
看看你做的好事
Looking at what you've wrought?

541
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,000
听着 如果你想杀了我
Look. If you're gonna kill me,

542
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,520
那就动手吧
let's get this over with.

543
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,020
我为什么要杀你？
Why would I kill you?

544
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,430
你捡起了银币
You picked up the coin.

545
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:20,020
Marcel 每一场战斗都有交战规则
There are rules of engagement in battle, Marcel.

546
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,830
没有规矩 不成方圆
Without them, you'd have anarchy.

547
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,720
但是 我更想谈谈
I would, however, like to talk

548
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,000
战利品
about accommodations,

549
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,940
比如说 你的领地
your living quarters, for example.

550
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,730
我相信它们曾经是属于我的
I believe they used to be mine.

551
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,590
你想要这一切？ 可以 都是你的了
You want all this? Fine. It's yours.

552
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:38,230
你可以把我驱逐到街上做小弟 都没关系
You can put me back on the street for all I care,

553
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:41,300
但是有件事我要和你说清楚
but let's make one thing clear.

554
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,110
你永远都得不到的是这个...
You'll never have this--

555
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,680
忠诚
loyalty.

556
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,640
你买不到  得不到
You can't buy it. You can't own it.

557
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,820
更强求不来
You can't force it.

558
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,460
它仅仅源于那些信任你的人
It comes only out of love and respect

559
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,520
对你的爱和尊重
for the people who believe in you.

560
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:01,040
你教过我很多东西 Niklaus Mikaelson
You taught me many things, Niklaus Mikaelson,

561
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,050
但这一个 是我自己学到的
but this I learned myself,

562
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,880
也是你永远都不会领悟到的
and it is something that you will never know.

563
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:13,550
尽情享受你的王国吧
Enjoy your kingdom.

564
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:49,860
谢谢你载我回来
So thanks for the ride.

565
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:53,510
真是一次尴尬的冒险旅程啊 不是吗？
Quite the awkward, little adventure, wouldn't you say?

566
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,060
抱歉我曾要伤害你
I'm sorry I tried to hurt you.

567
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,900
我从未想那么做
I would never want that.

568
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:00,730
Elij...
Elij--

569
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,690
告诉我Celeste发生了什么事
Tell me what happened to Celeste.

570
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:03,420
那不重要
That's not important.

571
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,410
那很重要
It is important.

572
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,360
你有着一千年的记忆
1,000 years of memories,

573
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,370
但是当你发烧的时候却偏偏想到她？
and that's what breaks through your fever brain?

574
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:13,140
我想知道 带我看吧
I want to know. Show me.

575
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:05,780
对于女巫来说那是一个残忍而血腥的时代
It was a cruel and bloody time to be a witch.

576
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,260
承蒙我那伟大的弟弟的好意
Courtesy of my wonderful brother.

577
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:11,260
Klaus杀了她？
She died because of Klaus?

578
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,370
她是因我而死
She died because of me,

579
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,220
因为我太在乎她
because I cared too deeply for her.

580
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:20,760
我任由弟弟在我的眼皮底下放纵
I had allowed my brother to slip through my grasp.

581
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:23,960
Celeste占据我所有思绪的时候 我就失去了对他的控制
I'd loosened the reins while Celeste consumed my every moment.

582
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,740
我以自己的幸福为名义放纵了他
I'd abandoned him in the name of my own happiness.

583
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:30,690
而Celeste却为此付出代价
Celeste paid the price.

584
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:35,630
我不明白 为什么我们要回来？
I don't get it. Why are we here?

585
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,790
为什么明明知道你的家庭已经破碎
Why are you trying to put together your family

586
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:41,370
你还是想要将它拼凑在一起？
when it's so clear that one part of it is broken?

587
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:43,300
对我来说 "破碎"这一词的特别意义就在于
To me, the very definition of the word

588
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:46,100
它还是可以修复的
"Broken" suggests that something can be fixed.

589
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,590
我有无尽的时间可以去完成
I have all eternity to accomplish

590
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:51,050
一个唯一的任务 那就是我弟弟的救赎
one single task-- my brother's salvation.

591
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:52,710
而如果我屈服了 那么你告诉我
If I surrender this, then, tell me,

592
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:56,560
我对我的家人 对我自己 
what value would I be to my family, to myself, to--

593
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,630
对你的孩子 还有什么价值？
to your child?

594
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:09,340
求你了 不要这样  Hayley
Please, no, Hayley.

595
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,570
不要再重蹈覆辙了
You've seen what happens.

596
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,310
Elijah也回来了 现在只有一把匕首
Elijah is home. There's only one dagger.

597
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:52,010
今天你要惩罚我们两个中的谁？
Which one of us will you be punishing today?

598
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:53,760
我想到了一个游戏
I contemplated a game

599
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:58,620
猜兵猜将
of eeny meeny miny moe.

600
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,910
你背叛了我 我的亲妹妹
You betrayed me, my own sister.

601
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,540
Niklaus 你敢
Niklaus, don't you dare.

602
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,090
也许会从你下手 哥哥
Well, perhaps it should be you, brother,

603
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:09,850
你对Hayley温柔献媚 款款深情
stealing my child away with every fawning moment

604
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:11,630
然后就可以偷走我的孩子
of tenderness you show to Hayley.

605
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,990
这跟Hayley没关系
This has nothing to do with Hayley.

606
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:14,800
跟她什么关系都有！
It has everything to do with her!

607
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:19,970
她从刚来时就崇拜你
She's adored you since she arrived,

608
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,330
现在我的孩子 我的亲生骨肉
and now my child, my blood,

609
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:26,200
长大后要叫你爸爸
will grow up to call you father.

610
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:29,280
你就是这么想的吗？
Is that what this is?

611
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:32,940
你又担心自己会被抛弃吗？
You are once again worried that you will be left behind?

612
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:35,310
这么些年你就没点儿长进吗？
Has history taught you nothing?

613
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:36,980
不是我们抛弃你 Nik
We don't abandon you, Nik.

614
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,150
是你疏远了我们
You drive us away.

615
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:42,400
真的吗？
Is that so?

616
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:48,750
我最近难道不是一直很配合你们吗？
What have I done lately other than cooperate?

617
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:51,580
我听从于你 哥哥
I bowed down to you, brother,

618
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:53,760
为了弥补我再次捅了你
to make up for daggering you,

619
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,650
为了我们夺回家园的宏伟计划
for the greater good of our plan to reclaim our home;

620
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,600
而看看你 妹妹
Looked the other way, sister,

621
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,620
你却又跟Marcel纠缠不清
while you repeat the same cycle with Marcel,

622
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:04,250
栽在这个你不该爱的男人身上
falling again for a man you shouldn't be with,

623
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:07,390
而他却统治着这个由我们建立起的帝国
while he controls the empire that we built

624
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:09,520
他占为己有
that he took.

625
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:16,480
对于过去犯下的过错 我无法否认
Now, I make no excuses for past sins,

626
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,290
但当那一刻 你们两个本可以
but in the one moment when you two could have

627
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:23,410
选择支持我 信任我
chosen to stand by me, to believe in me.

628
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,640
相信我对自己的骨肉没有什么不良企图
And believe my intentions for my own child were pure,

629
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,380
而你们却选择了敌对我
You chose to stand against me,

630
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:35,130
与我的敌人同流合污
to side with my enemies.

631
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,970
我想要夺回我们的家园
I wanted our home back.

632
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:45,860
现在我成功了
Now I have it.

633
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:48,320
所以我现在要去那儿生活
So I'm going to live there,

634
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:50,130
你们两个
and the two of you,

635
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:57,380
就呆在一起 慢慢腐烂在这里吧
you can stay here together and rot.

636
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:25,430
你得跟我走 小狼女
You're coming with me, little wolf.

637
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,450
我为什么要跟你走？
Why would I go anywhere with you?

638
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,580
因为你肚子里的孩子 Hayley
Because, Hayley, that child you carry

639
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:31,770
是我在这个世界上唯一关心的了
is the only thing on this earth that matters to me.

640
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:34,850
你可以以此跟我作对  但你斗不过我的
Now, you can fight me on this, but you will lose,

641
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:39,930
任何阻止你上车的人
as will anyone else who tries

642
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:41,480
也不会得逞
to stop you getting in this car.

643
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:06,870
我弄明白了 这个记号
I figured it out, the note.

644
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:09,850
我一直在想我遗失的时间
I was thinking about it-- my lost time,

645
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:11,270
还有我昏沉沉的大脑
my fog brain.

646
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,370
我觉得我一定是跟Sean一样疯了
I thought I must be going crazy like Sean,

647
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,130
但后来我想 是不是我的潜意识
but then I thought, "What if somewhere

648
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:20,120
在给我暗示呢？
in my subconscious, I was trying to send myself a message?"

649
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:30,400
《皮卡尤恩日报》1919

650
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:24,600
确实
I was.

651
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:34,370
我在1919年的《皮卡尤恩日报》里发现了这个
I found this in the "Picayune" newspaper archives from 1919.

652
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,460
看这张照片
Look at this photo.

653
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:48,290
那些人 我见过
Those men, I know them.

654
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:51,860
他俩我都认识
I know both of them.

655
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

656
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

657
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

658
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
