1
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,400
Just another day in the neighbourhood.

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,800
Keep firing!

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,700
It didn't have to go like this.

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,700
Yates, don't just sit there, return fire!
Let's go!

5
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,600
Angel! He's hit Russell.

6
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,400
Son of a bitch.
Why the hell weren't you covering him?

7
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,410
- You're good, okay.
- Yates...Yates,cover me.

8
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,290
YEAH

9
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,200
He's down! He's down!

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,100
Stay here.

11

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,900
You know this thing is amazing. I can push my ISO like crazy.

15
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,700
- I could shoot in a closet and there would be zero noise.
- Come on.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,200
You should let me take your picture, you're a beautiful man.

17
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:35,000
I do let you; that one time in Mexico wearing the sombrero.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,400
- Yeah and you were drunk and mooning me.
- Go to work.

19
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,220
OKAY , COME HERE

20
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,870
WHAT....

21
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,500
You're scared the camera's gonna reveal your deep dark secrets to me. Am I right?

22
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,000
What happens if you find out what a terrible person I am?

23
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,900
I'll take my chances.
Bye.

24
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,800
See you tonight.

25
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,700
The SMASH unit. Guns and Gangs.

26
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,800
We think there could be a coverup.
SMASH guys initiated the shoot out.

27
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,400
We're not convinced they had cause.
We've been concerned with this unit for some time.

28
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,200
- Their tactics, their use of force.
- So why haven't you pulled them from duty?

29
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,700
We haven't been able to prove anything. That's where you come in.

30
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,800
This guy was a veteran banger, Eight convictions. Trafficking, aggravated assault.

31
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,100
Wait a second, you're actually going to go after the SMASH unit?

32
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,600
You think that's wise? These guys are decorated cops.

33
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,700
- They're pretty much rock stars.
- Then I'm sure you won't find anything.

34
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,300
And if we do? They're also well connected.

35
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,600
The CIU is still a new unit, this could finish us.

36
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:43,700
An assignment like this is why you're in the budget.
It isn't up for debate, Rebecca.

37
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,800
If you think these guys aren't lying, then prove it.

38
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,700
That's Daniel's old unit, you know that right?

39
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,100
You're serious? We're working with Internal Affairs?

40
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,100
Isn't there like a rule about looking into other cops?

41
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,800
- Yeah,the rule is that you don't do it.
- You don't even think about it.

42
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,800
Daniel, you ran with these guys.
You want to set it up?

43
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,800
The SMASH unit. Some of the best cops I've worked with.

44
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,100
They pound the streets. They make a ton of arrests.

45
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,900
Sometimes they get a little cowboy, not everyone understands that.

46
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,200
Especially Internal Affairs.

47
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,900
Angel Abano, one of their guys.

48
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,300
He was injured during the shoot out.
They need someone to take his place.

49
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,200
That's going to be Jesse. He's new, they won't know him.

50
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,400
Daniel, I'm going to list you as a reference on
Jesse's paperwork I need you to set it up.

51
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,200
- What if I refuse?
- Then you can give me a call from traffic duty,

52
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,100
remind me how itchy that poly blend is in 80 degree heat.

53
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,600
- ???
- No!

54
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,900
None of you get to act like you're any more upset about this than I am.
Our job is to find out the truth.

55
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,000
Are they lying about the shooting? If so, what really happened out there?

56
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,200
If they're clean, we prove it and IA steps down.

57
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,900
We treat this like any other case.

58
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,400
Jesse.

59
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,400
Alright, listen up.

60
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,800
Russell Hagler, he runs the unit.

61
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,400
He's the one you need to impress, he's the key to this whole thing.

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,240
You two were close?

63
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,450
YEAH.

64
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,000
Russell was my mentor, three years.

65
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,300
He's like a big brother.

66
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,300
- What about that guy?
-That's Russell's right-hand man; Kevin Yates.

67
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,100
He's a good guy, real police.

68
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,600
Alright, let's go tell Rebecca you're ready.

69
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Daniel will set up the first introduction.

70
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,700
The SMASH guys always drink at the same bar; we'll do it on their home turf.

71
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,900
Jesse needs to make a good first impression, his entry into the unit depends on it.

72
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,100
Daniel will run cover.
I want everyone on their A game.

73
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,400
The faster we move, the faster we can close the book on this.

74
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,900
Yeah, tequila!

75
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,400
I keep thinking, we're cops, we're supposed to protect each other.

76
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,800
Yeah, you keep thinking that.

77
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,300
Look, at some point, they're going to test you, okay?

78
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,600
It's an initiation. Just roll with it, okay?

79
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,100
What about you. You up for this?

80
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,600
Hell yeah, time of my damn life.

81
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:44,400
- The prodigal son returns.
- I knew I smelled something when I walked in here.

82
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,300
You still got that halitosis problem, eh Pounds?

83
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,200
Why don't you gimme a kiss, and you'll find out.

84
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,500
Sure tonight's not gonna be too much action for you?

85
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,500
Hope you're up for some drinking, my friend.

86
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,800
Here he is, Jesse Borden, straight out of OPC.

87
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,700
Hotshot of his class. The academy's best kept secret.

88
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,300
Is that so?
Doesn't explain why you wanna be in my unit.

89
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,100
Ever since I was a kid. I wanted to help people.

90
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,500
Protect them.

91
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,600
Well, no offense kid, but we chase street waste.

92
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,600
- You wanna save people, go be a nurse.
- Hey,come on, man, you gotta settle down.

93
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,800
You're gonna scare the kid off before we even started.

94
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,590
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU. You look good, Danny Boy. C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.

95
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,470
THANKS MAN

96
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,690
- You gonna sit down?
- How's Terri?

97
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:31,500
O, COME ON MAN. You haven't seen me since I took homicide,

98
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,700
and you automatically think I'm with the same woman?

99
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,800
We're getting married this winter.

100
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,800
Same old Danny Price.
Most loyal guy I've ever known.

101
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,500
Hey look man, how's Angel?

102
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,700
He's doing alright, he's tough.

103
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,700
- You hear Yates is retiring?
- Yeah?

104
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,600
He's getting old and soft. I need somebody young.

105
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,620
This Jesse kid looks straight laced.

106
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,830
- YEAH
- Is he going to fit in?

107
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,500
YEAH, He's good, scrappy. I know his brother.

108
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,900
Don't let the pretty boy routine fool you. He's a tough kid.

109
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,200
Drink up, Jesse, they're on the house.

110
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,900
They know we're cops?

111
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,800
Kid, everybody here knows who we are.

112
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,300
We'll set up a cover apartment for Jesse. It'll be fully wired.

113
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,100
Khali will set up cameras and mics. Full coverage.

114
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,000
There's something going on with Yates.
He's hiding something.

115
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,300
- I got a hit off him.
- Look,you're the new guy on the team.

116
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,200
- They're going to be watching you, all of them.
- I don't know,

117
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,700
Yates felt different, he's more intense.

118
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,800
ALLRIGHT, Then you keep an eye on him, alright?
Don't make up stories.

119
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,000
Hey, come here.

120
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:00,040
I want you to go easyon him. If he tells you he got a hit, you listen.

121
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,900
- LOOK, I don't need a pep talk right now.
- Is there something you're not telling me?

122
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,400
It's business. Let's just do the job.

123
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,600
Get some sleep.

124
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,200
- How you doing?
- I've been better.

125
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,700
I've got cameras and mics in place.
They'll be up by tomorrow.

126
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,500
- Full coverage, everything except...
- Except bedroom?

127
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,700
Good night, Jesse.

128
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,600
I miss you.

129
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,500
You need to sleep.

130
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,300
And I need to get out of here before I do something stupid.So...

131
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:52,900
Talk to you later, okay?

132
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,200
Khali.

133
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,200
- You feel like taking a ride?
- Hey, what's going on?

134
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
We working tonight?

135
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,300
Hey, what are you doing?

136
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,800
This won't hurt a bit.

137
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,500
Don't move until I tell you.

138
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,100
So, think you can just show up out of nowhere and join my unit?

139
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,200
This is the real deal, kid.
You got what it takes to be here?

140
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,300
- Yeah.I think so.
- No, you either do or you don't!

141
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,600
Screw you.

142
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,200
Good. That's more like it.

143
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:08,800
NOW...There are three kilos of H inside that house, maybe more.

144
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,000
You're going to go in there and get it for me.

145
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:21,500
- What about a warrant?
- Don't worry about that, we've got it covered.

146
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,500
Move!

147
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,200
You want to run with SMASH, learn to improvise.

148
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,170
Now go.

149
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,000
?????????

150
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:58,500
Police! Don't move!

151
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,300
- We have a warrant to search the premises. PUT THE WEAPON DOWN
- You can't just come into my house.

152
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:06,200
C'mon, Andre, be a good boy; Tell us where the drugs are.

153
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,900
Screw you man, not till I see your warrant.

154
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,100
You wanna see my warrant, Andre?

155
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,600
Let's just see if I can find my warrant, huh.

156
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,100
Nope. Not here.

157
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,290
Hey, hey! Don't touch that.

158
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,850
THAT was my mom's stuff.

159
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:35,810
NO

160
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,800
What do you think, Russell? Should I leave this stuff alone?

161
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,600
You know what we came for.

162
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,400
Uhh-uhh. All right.

163
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,900
Come on, Andre, where are the drugs?

164
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,860
- THAT'S ENOUGH
- COME ON

165
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,800
No, no, no. Leave that alone, don't touch it.

166
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,240
What are you doing man?
<i>You said this was your mom's stuff.</i>

167
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,900
- This must be your mom, then.
- Put that down.

168
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,400
- Put it down.
- I'll put it right over here.

169
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,100
How far down you think this thing goes, Andre?

170
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,000
- You wanna take a guess?
- C'mon, where's the drugs?

171
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:18,600
You better tell him, Andre.

172
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,600
Stop!

173
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,000
- There she goes.
- No!

174
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,500
Be smart. We're not leaving without the stuff.

175
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,300
It's up to you how hard you wanna make this.

176
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:35,400
Okay, you're the boss.

177
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,700
Okay! Okay! Okay!

178
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,100
I'll tell you. Just stop!

179
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,100
- What?
- It's in the air conditioner out back. All of it.

180
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,490
Give me that.

181
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,600
HA HA, Mama's boy.

182
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,000
You're sick, kid, you know that, right?

183
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,300
And you, you're getting off lucky.

184
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,000
Yates, you found us.

185
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,800
I thought we weren't doing this tonight.

186
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,900
Yeah well, I guess I forgot to call you.

187
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:31,200
What went on here tonight, you like it?

188
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,400
Is that your style?

189
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,400
- I was just doing my job, man.
- Yeah?

190
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,500
It only gets worse from here.

191
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,100
You better get ready.

192
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:53,800
So last night, SMASH unit broke into a civilian's house,
trashed it, and threatened him with violence.

193
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,540
They didn't lay a single charge.

194
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,150
LOOK, I don't know it would get out of hand like that.

195
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:03,200
- He was trying to impress Russell, and it worked.
- It was an initiation and Jesse passed, with flying colors.

196
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,100
What happened last night was good. He's in.

197
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:09,100
We're trying to prove the unit's doing things by the book.
If last night's any indication...

198
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,400
Last night doesn't prove anything.

199
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,500
Sometimes you gotta bend the rules. These guys know that.

200
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,600
You're telling me you would go into someone's house, damage their property, threaten them.

201
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,100
Yes I would, if I had to.

202
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,500
Three kilos of heroin went into lock up early this morning, care of SMASH unit.

203
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,600
Silver lining?

204
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,200
The second in command, Yates. He wasn't there for the raid.

205
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,100
- Showed up later.
- You said there was tension?

206
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,000
- Big time.
- All right.

207
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,200
That's a crack. If they're on the outs, Russell's going to be looking for allies.

208
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,900
I want you to stay close, show him you're going to be loyal.

209
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,900
Hey, there's no reason to let IA know about last night's stunt. Right?

210
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:59,000
- Don't tell me you're not concerned?
- The SMASH unit they know the law.

211
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,100
They play in the grey when they need to.
I've seen you bend rules before Rebecca.

212
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,500
Don't give me the brotherhood speech.
I'm a cop, I know what it means to protect each other.

213
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,600
And here comes the "But".

214
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,200
If this is how these guys operate, you don't
think they'd cover up an illegal shooting?

215
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,100
You're part of a murder now, you know.

216
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,300
You passed the test.

217
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,200
What are you talking about a "murder"?

218
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
You know everybody thinks eagles are baddass 'cause they fly alone,

219
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,000
but they got nothing on crows.

220
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,600
You fly alone, you get yourself killed.

221
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:38,600
OKAY, The unit, is like a murder of crows.

222
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,500
Crows'll gather to decide the capital fate of another.
Make their own laws.

223
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,600
We're in a war against the streets, we can't win, Jesse.

224
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,200
You gotta choose which side of the battle you're on.

225
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,800
Here, double cream, double sugar.

226
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,600
Hey! Police don't move!

227
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,540
You don't know what you're doing, man.
It looks like I got you on unlawful possession.

228
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,400
You don't want to do that.

229
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,900
And what's this? Possession for the purposes of.

230
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,990
Jesse, you've gotta stop.

231
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,300
- Let him go.
- Are you serious?

232
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,100
He's got like 3 grams here; I just found a .38 in his underwear.

233
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:37,000
That little bit? Time we spend processing this guy.

234
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,210
You wanna tell me what the hell's going on with Russell IH THERE?

235
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,700
YEAH, I'd like to coach, but I'm pretty much in the dark myself.

236
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,500
Get in the car.

237
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,800
- Don't move.
- Wait a second.

238
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,500
You see this? He just gave him his gun back.

239
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,500
I'm bringing the kid in. You stay with Jesse.

240
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,900
Lucas Smith, AKA Baby Luke.

241
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:19,030
Did a stint in juvie, no arrests in 3 years.
Known member of the Marvo Crew.

242
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:22,400
Which is the biggest gang in the SMASH unit's jurisdiction.

243
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,700
If they're so big how come there are hardly any arrests in here?

244
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,100
The Marvo Crew run a pretty good racket

245
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,200
Must be nice to move all that dope, while SMASH unit looks the other way.

246
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,800
- How much you pay them?
- SMASH, what's SMASH?

247
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,360
I don't know what you're talking about, lady.

248
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,900
No? Then why did they let you walk when they found drugs and a gun on you today?

249
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:48,600
- Didn't let me walk far, I'm in here aren't I?
- It was my people who brought you in, not SMASH.

250
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:53,100
- C'mon, Luke, how much are you paying those cops?
- It's got to be enough to make it worth their while, right?

251
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,200
I've got nothing to say to you so why don't you run and get my lawyer now?

252
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,600
See, that's the good news. You don't need a lawyer.

253
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,800
We're going to let you go.

254
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,200
But first we're gonna put a call into the SMASH guys and tell them what you said.

255
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,900
How you told us all about them.
How they're taking bribes, how they're dirty...

256
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,600
Whoa, whoa, I didn't say any of that.

257
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,900
Okay. We'll just sit back and watch.

258
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:14,200
You don't have to rat them out.
We just wait to see what they do to you.

259
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,000
And that will be our evidence, right?

260
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:22,800
All right look, I'll take the charge, plead guilty,
whatever you want. All right just...

261
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,000
please, don't do this.

262
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,500
You're really that afraid of them?
You need to tell me why.

263
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,500
I'll get someone to escort you out of here. Come on.

264
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,200
Let me go! Wait. Alright!

265
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,500
You put it out there I'm a rat they're both gonna want me dead.

266
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,500
Both?

267
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,700
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Don't you get it?

268
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:47,400
They're working together.
Those cops and the Marvo Crew, they partnered up.

269
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,790
They're working the hood together.

270
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,530
SMASH is running the whole show.

271
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,900
Alright, sit down.

272
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,700
Stick with me, Jesse, I'll take care of you.

273
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,200
I can be your best friend, don't forget that.

274
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,100
See these guys, M3 Colts. Used to run this neighborhood,

275
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,500
before we came in and cleaned it up.

276
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,700
Wanna make an arrest so badly? Let's make one.

277
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:18,800
We're good here, Russell, it's fine. These guys are clean.

278
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,100
Doesn't look fine to me.

279
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,600
Jesse, check the backseat, tell me what you see.

280
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,700
What are you doing, Russell?

281
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,500
- Nothing in there.
- Nothing in there.

282
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,400
Really?

283
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,000
Really now, Russell.

284
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,900
What's this?

285
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,400
Congrats, kid.
You get to make your first arrest.

286
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,200
I was pissed enough that Internal Affairs was poking around,

287
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,700
- then I get your call.
- Sir.

288
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:20,200
- Do you have any idea...
- The shooting wasn't clean, sir.

289
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,600
The SMASH unit is allied with a gang, the Marvo Crew.

290
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,900
- They shot that kid over turf.
- You know this, how?

291
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,830
Some scumbag drug dealer told you?
I mean the kid's looking for a deal, Rebecca.

292
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:31,900
Accusing four cops is a suicide play, not a deal.

293
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:35,600
My guys witnessed Russell Hagler returning a weapon to a gang member.

294
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,800
I could arrest him right now.

295
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:43,200
- Look, I hate this as much as you do.
- You want to hand this off to me, is that why you called?

296
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,800
No sir, I want to pursue it.

297
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:51,000
If we don't, we're choosing to look the other way.
There's a point where the brotherhood ends.

298
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,800
- The information you've come across could be nothing.
- It isn't.

299
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,400
Whatever your guys think they saw... we don't know what that was.

300
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,900
- So you're planning to bury this?
- Hey, careful.

301
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,500
If you pursue this, and you're wrong?
You'll go down, hard.

302
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:09,800
This unit, your career, whatever you thought you knew, will be gone.

303
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,800
Due respect, sir, you need to start thinking about
what could happen if I'm right.

304
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,000
If you're right, I'll protect you.

305
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,300
But so far, Detective Sergeant?
I'm unconvinced.

306
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,500
You think that kid Luke's telling the truth?

307
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,700
SMASH is working with the Marvos.

308
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,800
Looks that way, yeah.

309
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,500
I want everyone in briefing, now.

310
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,200
You need to think about your reputation, your future as cops.

311
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,200
It's your decision.

312
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,400
If you go after other police, that's going to stick.

313
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,800
So this Luke kid, his word is iron clad?

314
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,600
Daniel, you watched Russell hand that weapon back to that kid yourself.

315
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:08,600
- Jesse saw him planting drugs.
- So why aren't we picking him up?

316
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,600
Because I want them all. The entire unit.

317
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,200
I'm not ordering you to do this. It's up to you.

318
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,700
From this point on, 

319
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,300
if you move forward with this operation it's because you chose to.

320
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,600
- Alright, so we're with you.
- Okay.

321
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,500
- We believe that SMASH is in bed with The Marvo Crew.
- According to Luke, the Marvos get a free pass.

322
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,600
Their rivals, the M3 Colts, get nailed every time.

323
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,900
Part of what they seize, they re-sell on the streets.

324
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,700
- The rest goes into lock up.
- That's a lot of drug money.

325
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,500
So what about Yates? He's unhappy.

326
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,400
- He's already leaving the unit.
- Could mean he's ready to flip.

327
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,700
We need to reach out to him.

328
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,100
Russell's all over me. I can't get near Yates.

329
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,000
What if I can?

330
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,600
Look, this is my unit, not SMASH.

331
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,900
Let's do this.

332
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,500
I thought only girls smoked those.

333
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,400
You're just jealous 'cause I make these look good.

334
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,300
Yeah you keep telling yourself that. What's going on?

335
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,080
You seen Jesse? I tried calling him.

336
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,000
YEAH, He's with Russell, we got squad soon.

337
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,500
No. You should go easy, you got shift soon.

338
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,500
- Takes the edge off.
- I heard you were retiring man.

339
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,490
- I remember when this unit meant everything to you.
- Used to mean something to you too.

340
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:51,500
YEAH, It wasn't easy walking away. Trust me.

341
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,500
Going a little too far, kicking some ass to get the bad guy.

342
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,100
It's not like that anymore.

343
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,090
We crossed over, Danny.

344
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:03,190
I SHOULD've done it back then.

345
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:05,100
Just like you. Drawn my line in the sand.

346
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,900
- You can do that now.
- Why do you think I'm getting out?

347
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,100
You care about that kid Jesse, you'll get him out too.

348
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,300
Hey Yates, is there something going on?

349
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,300
Is there something happening between you and Russ?

350
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:26,870
MEET US AT THE SPOT

351
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:27,900
It's Russell.

352
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,700
I gotta go.

353
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,200
Hold on, hold on. Just a second.

354
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,800
What's going on?
Is there something I need to know?

355
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,800
You keep an eye on Jesse, alright?

356
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,900
Jesse, what's happening?

357
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,600
M3 Colts have a stash house. Russell got a tip.

358
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,600
He wants to do a takedown now,
before they catch wind and move the product.

359
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,860
Alright you keep an eye on the drugs.
I'll call Rebecca. You gimme that location.

360
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,690
ALL RIGHT

361
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,200
Front door. We stay together on this one.

362
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,000
You two hang back, Yates and I will take the lead.

363
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,600
They're going in.

364
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,700
Yates, upstairs, let's go.

365
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,000
Jesse, let's go! Come on.

366
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:47,400
- Get your head out of your ass.
- Jesse's stalling, something's up.

367
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,700
Yates!

368
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,600
Easy, easy.

369
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,000
What the hell is going on?

370
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,400
He shot Yates.

371
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,340
Officer Borden. You need to come with me.

372
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,900
I've got questions about what happened today.

373
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,400
We gotta get him out of there.

374
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,900
Stay in the car. I don't want to burn him.

375
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,700
I've got this.

376
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,200
I want Jesse protected.

377
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,300
- Tell me you'll take care of him.
- Rebecca.

378
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:30,400
If it gets out that he went undercover on cops,
it will chase him for the rest of his career.

379
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,500
- Who the hell do you think you're talking to?
- Either he walks away from this unscathed,

380
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:36,100
or I will personally make sure that everyone on this force knows

381
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:39,200
that the reason Detective Yates died is because you wouldn't back me.

382
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,300
You'll be going down for this, not me.

383
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,500
It's been forever.
How do you think he's doing in there?

384
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,400
We'll see. Here he comes now.

385
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,800
I think Russell killed him.

386
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:21,100
I think he shot Yates and planted the gun on that kid at the scene.

387
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,200
It was the way he was moving around in that room.
It was the way he looked.

388
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,800
Did you tell them that?

389
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,400
No, I can't just accuse another cop.

390
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,600
Jesse, look at me.

391
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,400
You gotta be sure.

392
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,200
He did it. I'm sure.

393
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,500
Yates wanted out.
He was leaving the unit.

394
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,200
Russell thought he was gonna blow the whistle on them.
I sure of it.

395
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,900
We'll retake Officer Calvert's statement immediately, and go from there.

396
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:02,400
- You're going to be discreet, you're going to take his name out of this.
- Come on, that's not going to happen.

397
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:06,300
- He'll be crucified.
- A cop has been accused of murdering another cop, Rebecca.

398
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,000
There's no way this doesn't get ugly.

399
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,600
Staff Inspector Harrison...

400
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:14,400
Has no authority here, this is IA's investigation, Rebecca.

401
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,900
Either Jesse saw it or he didn't.
I want his statement.

402
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:26,900
We need proof.
I'm not putting Jesse out there on his own.

403
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:30,800
Alright, then we stay under.
We get to Russell first, before he feels the heat.

404
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,300
- Rebecca wants everybody in the briefing room.
- She can wait.

405
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,700
Yates was a friend of mine.
There's no way.

406
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,900
Russell is capable of a lot of things, but not that.

407
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,500
- I know what I saw.
- Then you saw wrong.

408
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,300
I'll tell her you're coming.

409
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,700
Middle of a raid, gunshots, things get foggy.

410
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:16,400
- It's hard to know what exactly you saw, Jesse.
- Maybe you've got tunnel vision.

411
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,900
This is hard for you, I get that.
But if Jesse's right, he needs backup.

412
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:23,100
He also needs proof. He's the one on the line here.

413
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:28,500
Yates was about to retire from the unit.
Russell was paranoid he was going to talk.

414
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,600
- Let's use that paranoia.
- Could be our best way in.

415
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,800
Daniel, you know Russell the best. You tell us.

416
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,900
Look, if this is true,

417
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,800
maybe Jesse can call him, tell him he wants out of the unit.

418
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,500
We need to make Russell feel like he's losing control.

419
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:50,200
He'll be worried what Jesse saw at the raid. He'll want to come see him.

420
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,300
Okay Jesse, you talk to him, you got to open up.

421
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:57,700
Tell him you're freaking out about what you saw in the house.
You got to get him to talk, alright?

422
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,700
You okay?

423
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,200
Yeah. I'm good.

424
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,900
Alright let's get to work.

425
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:18,800
You nervous?

426
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,200
Yeah.

427
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,500
Me too.

428
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,200
Let me hear the audio again.

429
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,400
Can you say something? Give us a level.

430
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,800
Russell, I've been thinking.

431
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,500
I've been thinking it over, and it's not for me.

432
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,500
That's good, we're good. We're ready.

433
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,700
Jesse... Yeah.

434
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:51,600
You' got this, okay? You can do it.

435
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,700
Heads up.

436
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,500
Okay Jesse, they're coming to the door.

437
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,500
- You alone?
- Yeah.

438
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,300
I know what happened was tough, alright?

439
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,300
But it doesn't mean you need to leave the unit.

440
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,500
I been thinking about SMASH, what you guys do.

441
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:59,100
- It's just not for me.
- What we do?

442
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,700
Pounds, what's that mean, "What we do"?

443
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,800
Beats me. What's that mean, Slick?

444
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,660
So let me get this straight. NOW...

445
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,300
You want to leave.

446
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:16,870
- Look, Jesse, I can't let that happen.
- Nope.

447
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,800
No can do, J-bird.

448
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,100
Russell's too paranoid, he's not going to talk.

449
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:28,670
If you do leave, we have no chance but to tell everyone the truth.

450
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,200
Truth?

451
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,800
Truth about you.

452
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,600
See, we paid Andre a visit this morning.

453
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:41,100
Turns out he remembers this night pretty clearly.

454
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:45,800
Mostly you, you kicking in his front door,

455
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,200
waving a gun in his face.

456
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,500
Yeah, he remembers that real clear.

457
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,700
I was just doing what you guys told me to do.

458
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,200
I never told you to intimidate anyone.

459
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,700
Destroy his possessions. I didn't tell you that, did I?

460
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:03,300
That's heavy badge syndrome. You couldn't be controlled.

461
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:09,000
Russell was trying to give you a shot and you - you blew it.

462
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,200
Fact is, the whole time we worked with you,

463
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:16,400
you were breaking into houses, planting drugs, falsifying reports.

464
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,200
Total behaviour problem.

465
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,600
Now, kinda makes sense, given where you came from.

466
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,400
Read your file, kid, you grew up in Southside.

467
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:30,200
Just another lonely kid looking to belong, right?
The only problem is you're nothing but trouble.

468
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,200
I sure hope you're tired of being a cop, Jesse.

469
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,410
Because you are done.

470
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:37,190
WHAT's he talking about?

471
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:40,700
Russell's not going to give us anything.
He's going to try to destroy Jesse's credibility.

472
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,900
That'll never stand up.

473
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:45,700
Really? Look he's got the neighborhood under his thumb, they'll vouch for Russell.

474
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:51,700
What's he doing?

475
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,300
Daniel. Daniel!

476
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:00,200
He's going inside.

477
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
What is he thinking?

478
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,000
I don't know.

479
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,600
- What are you doing?
- I trusted you. How could you do this?

480
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,300
Let's get the hell out of here man, we gotta go.

481
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,000
Danny. What the hell man?

482
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,200
You going to tell me what's going on?

483
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,050
Listen to me. Just trust me, we gotta get out of here.

484
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:23,600
NO, No one goes anywhere until you tell me what's going on.

485
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,100
Listen, I got a buddy, alright.

486
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,100
He's got his ear to the ground, and he gave me a call.

487
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:38,400
IA, the kid's on the job, he's working you.

488
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,500
Look, I'm sorry, I screwed up.

489
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,800
I would've never brought him near you, if I knew.

490
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,800
Yo, Russell, what's up, you're making me nervous over here.

491
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,200
The kid's working us.

492
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,500
Hey, come on man, calm down.

493
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,300
Check the place, it's wired.

494
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,200
Where is it?

495
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:01,800
Where is it?

496
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,200
Where is it?

497
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,310
I don't know.

498
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,300
Russell.

499
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,270
You little bitch.

500
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:13,880
RUSSELL, COME ON, MAN. RUSSELL, RELAX. RELAX,MAN

501
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,000
- I'm screwed, Danny.
- Okay.

502
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,700
So, what if the kid saw you get a little out of line.

503
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:27,600
Everyone knows that's what we do, that's part of the job.

504
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:31,900
- Russell, what are we doing man; we should get out of here.
- Shut up and let me think!

505
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:37,300
I JUST... I JUST... I just need to think. I just need to think.

506
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,300
You.

507
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,500
You introduced this kid to me.

508
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:50,000
- YEAH, Russ, I came to find you, I came to make this go away.
- How do I know you're not wired?

509
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,400
Russ. Come on!

510
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,200
The Bardi crew.
Eight years ago, you remember that?

511
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:58,100
That big takedown we did?
Remember that guy that was mouthing off too much?

512
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:02,000
Costa Sanchez.
You beat him up pretty bad, Russ.

513
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,100
He ended up dying in hospital later.

514
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,700
I didn't report that.

515
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,640
I protected you.

516
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,900
We're recording this. Does he know that?

517
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,700
- What the hell are you doing Daniel?
- And if I was wearing a wire would I say all of this?

518
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,200
I'm just as guilty as you.

519
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,900
Russ, come on we're brothers, man. I had your back then.

520
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,100
Don't I have it now?

521
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,700
But you gotta talk to me, you gotta tell me what's going on Russell.

522
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,800
What did you do?

523
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:39,580
RUSS, what the hell is going on?

524
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,700
- I'm in a lot of debt man.
- Money?

525
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,400
So, you took some money you shouldn't have, man.

526
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,600
What else? We all get tempted. What else?

527
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:50,300
Russell!This place is wired.

528
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,000
It doesn't matter, not anymore.

529
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,600
He was going to squeal.

530
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:05,600
He was going to hurt us. All of us.

531
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,100
Daniel, I needed him gone.

532
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,100
- Russell!
- Shut up!

533
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,100
Are you talking about Yates, Russell?

534
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,800
Russell, did you shoot Yates?

535
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,900
He told me he wasn't gonna let it go.

536
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:27,000
I had to, for us, didn't I?

537
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,700
Daniel, I am in so deep man.

538
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,000
I shouldn't have protected you back then.

539
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,500
I'm taking you in.

540
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,400
You think you're better than me, is that it?

541
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:49,600
You would have done the same thing.
We are the same.

542
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,700
We're not the same.

543
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,200
Not now.

544
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,300
Not ever.

545
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:44,400
- What happened with Daniel?
- Daniel was a rookie cop when he was with SMASH.

546
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,600
A kid too scared to go against the force.

547
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:50,100
That was my argument, to the Chief Inspector.

548
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,510
Okay.

549
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:55,730
AND he bought it?

550
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,700
That could have gone a different way.

551
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,200
I could've been wrong.

552
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,800
You guys all followed me in,

553
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,100
and I could've been wrong.

554
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,200
Yeah, but you weren't.

555
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:31,900
Look, Rebecca, what you did today.

556
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:37,300
Taking on the brass. IA. You put your team first.

557
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,800
No other cop I know would have been able to do that.

558
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,700
No other cop,

559
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,900
would've had the strength.

560
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:29,400
Russell said this thing to me.
About the streets, what we do...

561
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,600
How we're fighting a war that we can never win.

562
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,400
You think he's right?

563
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,900
So what's the point of all this, then?

564
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,800
The war's not out there, it's in here.

565
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,200
Up to you how long you want to fight.

566
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,900
Good job today.

567
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,200
What's this, what are you guys doing?

568
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,800
Buying my friend Terri a drink, thought you might want to join us?

569
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,530
You okay?

570
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,500
ALRIGHT, I'm going to get a...
Yeah. YEAH, YEAH

571
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:13,800
Hey, Coach.

572
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,400
I think I can use that pep talk now.

573
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,300
You seemed to be doing fine on your own today.

574
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,800
But, if I was, I'd tell you, you don't owe him anything, Daniel.

575
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,900
- You know that, right?
- Guy made me the cop I am today.

576
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:32,400
No. You made the cop that you are today.

577
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,800
With a little help from us.

578
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,400
- What?
- Thanks, man.

579
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,000
No problem.

580
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,500
- Hey can I get a beer?
- Sure.

581
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,800
So. Do you want to talk about it now or later?

582
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,400
Later. Okay?

583
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:59,200
I'm not going anywhere.

584
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:19,000
