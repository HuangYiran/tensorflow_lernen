1
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,180
Why are there giant lollipops
all over the front yard?

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:07,990
And why do they taste so bad?

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,140
Because they're made out
of cardboard,mouth-breather.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,850
The world needs more dreamers,luke.

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,220
Never stop licking things.

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,370
I know it's lame,but after last year,

7
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,310
we promised the neighbors we would keep
our decorations more family-friendly.

8
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,560
We can't even carve a pumpkin?

9
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,080
The petition was very specific.

10
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,090
Every halloween,we have the best house.

11
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,560
Last year,I took things
to a whole new level,

12
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,940
but apparently,it was
too scary for some kids...

13
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:32,430
And one adult.

14
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,420

Trick-or-treat!

15
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,690
Would you like some candy?

16
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:42,420
Or would you rather have this?

17
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,990
Come on.You're fine.

18
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:58,260
I don't care what anyone says.

19
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,040
You did not give that
man a heart attack.

20
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:00,810
Thank you.

21
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,320
I mean,you're not even scary.

22
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,230
Can I grab a little bit of this
candy for my open house tonight?

23
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,520
Uh,yeah,sure,but...

24
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:07,570
It's genius.

25
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,700
An open house on halloween.

26
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:12,890
Millions of bored parents
just trying to keep their...

27
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:14,300
Kids out of traffic.

28
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,390
Now they can get away from
all that,and see a nice house.

29
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,410
What do you mean,i'm not even scary?

30
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,410
I literally almost scared
the life out of a man.

31
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:25,900
You literally scared a little
saliva and a little urine out of him.

32
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,610
That happens to me every time I
see a monkey wearing people clothes.

33
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:29,880
I was plenty scary.

34
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,550
I used professional-grade makeup.

35
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,270
That's the point,claire.It was overkill.

36
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:37,920
You're the kind of person who can be
twice as scary without wearing any makeup.

37
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,800
Bye.

41
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,050
You remembered to pick
up the costumes,right?

42
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:54,980
Yes,they're right over there.

43
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,100
Very excited.

44
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,470
Cam has lost a lot of weight...no.

45
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,490
So we're throwing a halloween
party to debut the new him.

46
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,980
I'll be dressed as a matador.

47
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,350
Wh-what is it now,30?

48
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,320
32.4.

49
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,580
So I've lost lily.

50
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,070
Where is lily?

51
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,530
Do you-you don't have her?

52
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,650
- no.Why would I have her?I don't have her in my pocket.
- Cam?

53
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,270
What about the tiara?

54
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,460
Uh,we didn't buy one.

55
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,970
You can just use the one from last year.

56
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,210
Are we poor?

57
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,340
No,sweetheart,but you
don't need two tiaras.

58
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,490
How 'bout next halloween
you try a different costume?

59
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,830
No.I have to be a princess.

60
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:28,930
Every year?Why?

61
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:32,630
Because my mom's a
princess,just like you told me.

62
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,020
Cam and I have always
known that someday,

63
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,970
we were gonna have to have the big
talk with lily about who her mom was.

64
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,070
We-we were gonna pick the
right time and do it together,

65
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,730
carefully following
an agreed-upon script.

66
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:49,840
Then I got tired.

67
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:54,000
"and she was the most beautiful
princess in all the land.

68
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,110
The end." Again.

69
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,660
Why is tyler's mommy so fat?

70
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,060
Oh,that's because she has
- She has a baby in her belly.

71
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,170
Okay?Good night.

72
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:09,450
Was I in my mom's belly?

73
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,440
Lily,no more questions,all right?

74
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,440
Just-just go to sleep.

75
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,000
Where's my mom now?

76
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,010
Um,she's...

77
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,330
In a faraway land.

78
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:21,170
why?

79
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:24,290
Because she's a princess.

80
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,210
And she's...

81
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,080
Very,very busy.

82
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:29,720
Okay.

83
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,230
I thought that she'd forget
about it by the next morning.

84
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:33,670
I mean,I did.

85
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,340
Oh,I knew I was gonna have to tell
cam,and he was gonna be furious,

86
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,330
but I was hoping that
he'd see the bigger issue.

87
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,970
You know,I was really tired.

88
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,820
Hey,cam,you know this whole thing about
lily wanting to be a princess again?

89
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,910
Well,I-I think it might be because
I let her believe her mother was-

90
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,200
This is a nightmare.

91
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,470
It was just a mistake.

92
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,970
More like a disaster.

93
00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:00,310
They sent the matador costume in your
size,and the bull costume in mine.

94
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,490
I didn't notice.

95
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:05,390
Now no one's gonna see my bod
in this bulky bull costume.

96
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,100
It was-it was honestly a mistake.

97
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:09,500
L- listen,um,you-you could do that
other thing that you thought of.

98
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:12,860
You could put on that gorgeous
white suit that fits you so well now,

99
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,700
and you could be Mr.Roarke,and
lily could be your tattoo.

100
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:18,110
No!I have to be a princess!

101
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:19,920
Oh,but,lily,you were
a princess last year.

102
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:23,320
No!You promised!I'm being a princess!

103
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,540
Why is she so obsessed with princesses?

104
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:27,710
Well. . .

105
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,610
Like we weren't at that age?I mean. . .

106
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,340
I'm not mad about the ticket.

107
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:38,280
It's just the first time I couldn't
charm my way out of one of these things.

108
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,260
The way I see it,it's not a ticket.

109
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,870
It's a conversation.

110
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,970
No offense.You don't need that siren.

111
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,390
You could stop traffic just
getting out of that squad car.

112
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:48,050
License and registration,please.

113
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,250
I,uh. ..I'm no stranger to
the police academy myself.

114
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,370
Seen all seven of them.

115
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:55,800
Sir,no one's seen all seven.

116
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,720
Is this information accurate?

117
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,880
Yeah.Uh,except for the weight.

118
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:02,360
I thought they wanted to
know how much I could curl.

119
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,750
I must be getting rusty with my moves.

120
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:06,950
Moves?What moves?

121
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,740
You know,flash the baby blues,hit
'em with the devilish grin.

122
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:13,020
In case of emergency,break
glass and bust out the dimple.

123
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,450
Hey,isn't that one from the smallpox?

124
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,410
'cause I'm 100.

125
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:17,430
Chicken pox.

126
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:20,020
And it doesn't matter where
it's from.It always worked.

127
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,210
Hey,mom.

128
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,490
Manny,why are you coming
back from school so late?

129
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,090
I got sent to the principal's office.

130
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,100
- I am sending him an angry e-mail,because
I don't like when - no,no,no.

131
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,140
It's not his fault.

132
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,030
What did you do wrong?

133
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,110
Nothing.

134
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,550
Oh,that's it.I'm calling him.

135
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,940
- I hate when he tries to
- Nothing on purpose.

136
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,420
It was between periods,right
before this big test.

137
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:40,630
I was clearing my mind by practicing
some of my gene kelly dance moves.

138
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:41,940
As one does.

139
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:42,810
Right.

140
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,280
And my umbrella accidentally
snagged the fire alarm.

141
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:47,760
The principal thought I did it
on purpose so we'd miss the test.

142
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,940
But you didn't!

143
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:49,550
That's it!

144
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,120
- I'm going to his house!
- Mom!

145
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:52,360
You gotta stop doing this.

146
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:55,650
I'm not sure if it's the pregnancy,which
we both know isn't your fault...

147
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,470
But lately you've been such a hothead.

148
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,700
I am not a hothead!

149
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,280
I am colombian.

150
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,280
We get excited.

151
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,610
My country is covered in coffee.

152
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,750
Just like the starbucks girl
when she got your order wrong?

153
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,830
Half-caf,non-fat
wet soy latte.

154
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,950
How hard is that to hear?!

155
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,440
you don't get to be 2
- time nonconsecutive district salesman of the year

156
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,260
without thinking inside the box.

157
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:26,270
That's right.

158
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,760
I said "inside.

159
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,320
" You know why?

160
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,890
'cause while everyone's chasing
each other around outside the box,

161
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,160
you know what the box is?

162
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,490
Empty.

163
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:38,450
Which brings us back to
our formal dining room.

164
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,850
Now any questions?

165
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,640
Can we have our candy now?

166
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:44,130
Just as soon as we go over what
you're gonna tell your parents.

167
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,430
Now what was our style?

168
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:48,420
- Pre-war
craftsman.- Good,good.

169
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,600
And how many square feet?

170
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,450
3,500.

171
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,160
Still no
trick-or-treaters?

172
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:55,910
Not yet.

173
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,520
Well,maybe people are
going out later this year.

174
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,870
Well,the street's full of kids,but they're
actively detouring around our house.

175
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,280
Move along.

176
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,840
Who wants some candy?

177
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,590
Plenty of name-brand...

178
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,050
- Family-friendly candy
right here.- It's a trap!

179
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,320
No.I-ooh,how about you?

180
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,550
hey
- You want some candy,right?

181
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,660
- Come on,have some candy!
- Mom!

182
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,670
Mommy,she's got me!

183
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,980
No,I don't
- I'm not trying

184
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,070
- My candy!
- Just leave it!

185
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:39,540
Jay,you have to get ready
for mitch and cam's party.

186
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,630
Gloria,does my skin look looser to you?

187
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:43,600
What?

188
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,970
Maybe I should try some of
that fancy neck cream of yours.

189
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:48,770
Don't you have some with specks
of diamonds in it or something?

190
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,620
- Trick-or-treat.-
Trick-or-treat.

191
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,560
You guys don't even have costumes.

192
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:53,800
I'm a skeleton.

193
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,290
And I'm-i'm a lemon.

194
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,080
Aren't you too old to
be trick-or-treating?

195
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,660
Aren't you too old to be having a baby?

196
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,510
Ah,you find that funny,lemon?

197
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,960
Here's a better joke.

198
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,050
Knock,knock.What's gone?

199
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,320
Your candy!

200
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:11,500
What was that?

201
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:14,000
- Some rude dummies,that they think that they can
- All right,listen.

202
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,620
Let's just calm down.

203
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:18,020
Get ready for the party.

204
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,020
Calm down what?

205
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,420
You think I'm a hothead,like manny?

206
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:22,150
no!

207
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,150
You can be emotional.

208
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:25,760
Volatile,maybe.

209
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,540
Still,that's a far cry from

210
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,620
You put egg on my house,i
kill what you love!

211
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,280
psycho.

212
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,810
Plush utility room?

213
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:37,910
Yeah,right.I know a hall
closet when I see one.

214
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,210
And your dad never lies?

215
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,960
What medical school did the
great appliance doctor attend?

216
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:42,760
Hey,delgado.

217
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,460
Oh,no!

218
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:44,140
Durkas!

219
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,760
What I wouldn't give for this
umbrella to have mary poppins' powers.

220
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,610
Oh,I pray he didn't hear that.

221
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,930
Heard you pulled the fire alarm
today and got us out of that test.

222
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,020
Good job.

223
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,270
Thanks,Mr.Durkas.

224
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,120
You know what?

225
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,260
You don't need to call me that anymore.

226
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:58,810
Anyway,we're all meeting at the playground
at 8:00 and heading out,if you want to join.

227
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,750
You're totally going to that.

228
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,670
Yeah,if you want to
ruin your reputation.

229
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,390
You're finally gonna be
in with the cool kids.

230
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:08,010
You need to talk at the school assembly on
monday and apologize to all the teachers.

231
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,400
Teachers.More like
public sector parasites.

232
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,510
Be strong,manny.

233
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,150
Be smart.

234
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:13,800
Adventures,parties.

235
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,060
Juvie,heartache.

236
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,730
Girls!

237
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:17,170
But not the kind we want.

238
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,520
They're all the kind we want.

239
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:21,400
Mr.Dur
- Conrad!?

240
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:24,950
take one.

241
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,570
I'm an egg donor.

242
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,850
I love your costume,too,cam.

243
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:29,810
Adora-bull.

244
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,670
Oh,well,thank you.It's all in fun.

245
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,910
I half-wanted to wear
something tighter.

246
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,080
You know,I've been reducing.

247
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:34,690
I can see.

248
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,700
Well,you say it like you can't.

249
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:36,900
No,no,no.I totally can.

250
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:40,550
Impressive,huh?

251
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,830
Yeah.I'm-i'm gonna...

252
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,220
Hey,cam.

253
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,520
I'm hearing a rumor that
you keep flashing our guests.

254
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,160
Oh,well,not in a perverted way.

255
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:52,320
I just want people to see my
body under this stupid costume.

256
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:54,280
That's very close to
what actual flashers say.

257
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:54,850
Daddy?

258
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,840
Yeah,one second,honey.

259
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,190
I'm just tired of throwing out
compliments and not getting anything back.

260
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,730
I told roberto his
spray tan looked real.

261
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,380
Look for yourself.

262
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:02,240
It's on two of our pillows and our cat.

263
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:02,930
Daddy.

264
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,410
Lookit.It's my mommy.She came.

265
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,640
Oh,no,honey,that's not your mommy.

266
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,950
- It's not?
- No,no.

267
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,520
That's just one of daddy's friends.

268
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,420
What's going on?

269
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,240
Oh,nothing.She just wants
one of these cupcakes.

270
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:15,950
But I already had
- Oh,there you go,honey.

271
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,780
Okay,off you go.Mingle!Mingle!

272
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,500
Looks like some people came by.

273
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,090
Yeah.Oh,yeah,we had a few.

274
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,020
I saw that.

275
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:28,840
Hello?

276
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:29,850
Hey,honey.

277
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,990
Hi.How's your open house?

278
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:35,080
Pretty empty,actually.

279
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:37,230
I kind of just took it
out on a harry potter.

280
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,470
Seriously,though,a gryffindor letting
his mom carry his quidditch broom?

281
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,820
How hufflepuff is that?

282
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,200
It's pretty lonely here,too.

283
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,400
We have been shunned by
the whole neighborhood.

284
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:46,290
That's ridiculous.

285
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,700
All over some mild
little gag you pulled?

286
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,200
It was not mild.

287
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,780
There was an investig-

288
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,040
Oh,I-I thought I heard someone.

289
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,500
I guess it was just trees
tapping against the window.

290
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,900
It's pretty creepy over here
in this rattly old house.

291
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,900
Anyway,I'll probably give it another
30 minutes,then I'll see you at home.

292
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:06,620
Okay.

293
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:07,340
bye.

294
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,950
What are you laughing about?

295
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,390
Oh,it's just your poor dad,you know.

296
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,560
Your poor,dumb dad.

297
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,510
I'll fill you in at the staff meeting

298
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:28,730
after keneally's done telling
us about his morning commute.

299
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,700
That's hilarious!You
sound just like him.

300
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,100
You are so doing that at
christmas talent night.

301
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:37,120
Dude,"rich girl," "sara smile"..

302
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:38,920
Then a "maneater" encore.

303
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,380
It was scary how good they were.

304
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,530
Close your eyes,it could
have been the real band.

305
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:47,990
Yeah,he got lucky in the football pool
once,and now he wants to double the stakes.

306
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,920
Oh,I'm so scared!

307
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:51,950
right?

308
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,760
Well,this night was a bust.

309
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,800
Not a single person even...

310
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,740
Or did I speak too soon?

311
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:04,310
Was someone in the mood
to be a bad little ghoul?

312
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,720
Oh,connie,I didn't mean you.

313
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:11,120
I'm-hey,that's just- That's
just the divorce talking.

314
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,690
Hang in there.

315
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,030
Bye-bye.

316
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,350
Well,someone decided to take a
trip to fantasy island after all.

317
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,860
Well,I'm tired of people
not noticing my new physique.

318
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,690
If this doesn't work,i'm breaking out the
diaper and top hat and going as baby new year!

319
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,950
- Hello.
- Oh,my god!

320
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,720
John-john,is that you?

321
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,240
You look amazing.

322
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,990
Thanks!That's what happens
when you lose 100 pounds.

323
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:43,210
Oh,come on.What a-

324
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,220
Who wants to lift me?

325
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,270
- me.
- Come on.

326
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:46,840
How could he have not called us?XXX

327
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:49,930
You know what?

328
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,280
I'm gonna go lift him and
shake him till his staples pop.

329
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,270
Cam,stop!

330
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,230
Just saying that we could
have caught those kids.

331
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,820
What,and chase them around all night?

332
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,300
I'm not a young man anymore,as
the world keeps pointing out.

333
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:02,020
What did that waiter
just call you outside?

334
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:03,180
Medieval knievel.

335
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,290
That is hilarious.

336
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,020
I love when people put some
thought into their outfit.

337
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,070
Illegal alien,sugar daddy.

338
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,100
Why do you say "illegal"?

339
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,140
Because antennas are alien,and you're-

340
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,460
What?Illegal?

341
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,440
Because of the color of my skin?

342
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,590
Why don't I dump your
baby in your gas tank?

343
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:19,030
Gloria!

344
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,520
Uh,no hard feelings,please.

345
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,730
Just enjoy the party,okay?

346
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,510
First of all,relax.We're at a party.

347
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,920
Secondly,you've been deported twice.

348
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:28,840
You're not allowed to be that defensive.

349
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,160
What is it with me lately?

350
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,210
Manny's right.I'm such a hothead.

351
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,050
It happens.

352
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,260
You're pregnant.

353
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,490
That's what it is,isn't it?

354
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,090
It's the baby.

355
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,140
It's angry in there.

356
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:41,720
no!

357
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:42,560
yes!

358
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,150
You just said it yourself.

359
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:45,940
I have changed.

360
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:48,740
I have an angry baby inside
of me making me do bad things!

361
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,520
It's just hormones.

362
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,090
It's your mama bear instinct kicking in.

363
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:56,810
And that's a good thing,because that
means you're gonna be a great mom-again.

364
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,420
Do you really think so?

365
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:00,910
You got a lucky little kid in there.

366
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:03,710
He's got a mom who's not
gonna let anyone harm him.

367
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,030
Or her.

368
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,150
Or-or him.

369
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,950
- Trick-or-treat.-
Trick-or-treat.

370
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,240
Go ahead.

371
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,120
You better run!

372
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:21,430
Oh,my gosh,is that the most
precious thing you've ever seen?

373
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:22,540
Oh,my god.

374
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,680
Do you know other princesses?

375
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,360
Trust me.

376
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:27,160
I know lots.

377
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:27,610
Okay.

378
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,160
Bedtime.

379
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,510
Oh,no,it's not that late.

380
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:30,600
Do you know my mom?

381
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:31,960
She's a princess.

382
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,340
She's exhausted.

383
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,190
She's not making sense.

384
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,150
She's so tired.

385
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,460
Daddy,you told me!

386
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,240
What is she talking about,mitchell?

387
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,260
My real mom.

388
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,340
She is,right?

389
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,380
Okay,I think we need
to have a little talk.

390
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,360
Sam,do you notice how
slim cam's getting?

391
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:45,920
Nice try.

392
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,110
I will be back for that answer.

393
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,060
This isn't gonna work,claire...

394
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,550
'cause I know you're here.

395
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,650
What's the plan,anyway?

396
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,740
You gonna pop out at me?

397
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:03,900
It's gonna take more
than that to scare this...

398
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,300
- Hello?!
- hi!

399
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,700
Is the house still open?

400
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,540
Oh,yes!Yes!I'll be right down.

401
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,080
Claire,this is serious!I have a job!

402
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:12,550
Not that you don't.

403
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:15,160
You work 24/7 and you don't get
half the appreciation you deserve.

404
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,520
Can we talk about this later?

405
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:21,370
As you potential buyers can
see,this is a,uh,a beautiful home.

406
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:22,120
What's behind here?

407
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,140
Oh,I wouldn't go in there!

408
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,160
Unless you love formal dining rooms.

409
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:29,480
Honey,look at this.

410
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,220
I'm in the kitchen.

411
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,060
Oh,we should probably stay together.

412
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,630
Come on,sheila.

413
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,400
Phil,one question.

414
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:35,830
- Are these
- wait,wait.

415
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:39,890
I just love to see people's reactions when I show them
- So much storage.

416
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:41,390
What?It's crazy!

417
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,850
I think you guys will find that
this house is full of so many...

418
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,300
Delightful surprises that
you'll be happy here for

419
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,870
- Oh,my god!
- I don't know her!

420
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:51,810
Is this the original tub?

421
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:52,680
What?

422
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,100
Yes,it is.

423
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,800
It is,uh,the original tub.

424
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,990
Um,original fixtures,beveled mirror,

425
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:01,720
just a-a huge stall shower if you
guys would,uh,want to have a party.

426
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,870
I'm kidding,of course.

427
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,260
But,um,just a house
with a real personality.

428
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,800
We'll be right in,sweetie.

429
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:14,590
We agreed to tell lily about her mother
together,wearing calming earth tones,

430
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,400
and we agreed to tell her the truth.

431
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:20,020
I know,but haven't you ever said something dumb
to lily that you wish she would just forget?

432
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:20,840
This isn't about me.

433
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,300
Let's just fix this.

434
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,370
Okay,great.

435
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,520
Although...

436
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:27,840
The way you agreed so quickly makes me
wonder what sort of things you've told her.

437
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,580
I may have told her
her fibs kills birds.

438
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,220
We're coming back to that one.

439
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,120
Oh,hi,princess.

440
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,050
Hey,lil.

441
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,420
Could we talk to you for a second?

442
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,770
Am I in trouble?

443
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:39,980
Oh,gosh,no.

444
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,260
Of course not,sweetie.

445
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:46,550
Well,do you remember how we used to tell you
there was a heaven for all the flowers that die?

446
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,920
What do you mean,"used to"?

447
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,550
Sorry,I let it slip.We'll
deal with it later.

448
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,270
Much much are you not telling me?

449
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,150
Why are you talking like this?

450
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:55,090
Daddies took a little
side trip.Sorry,sweetie.

451
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,760
Um,so sometimes,uh,we tell you things
like that to make you feel better.

452
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:05,490
And I might have done the same thing when
I told you that your mom is a princess.

453
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:09,260
So she's not?

454
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:11,370
Well,you know what?

455
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,180
She might be.

456
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,110
She might be.

457
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,760
But we can't know for
sure,honey,because...

458
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,390
Well,we don't know where she is or...

459
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:21,070
What she's doing.

460
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,610
B- but what-what we do know is
that she loved you very,very much...

461
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,470
And she knew that she
couldn't take care of you,

462
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:30,870
so she made sure that you went with
the most loving family she could find.

463
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,450
And that's how the three
of us became a family.

464
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,830
Does that make sense,sweetie?

465
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,660
Do you have any questions for us?

466
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,140
Why did you say a fib and kill a bird?

467
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,300
I noticed you walking in
with your wife earlier.

468
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:48,160
She's stunning.

469
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:49,640
You know my favorite
part of that compliment?

470
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,910
You knew she was my wife.

471
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,550
Half the world thinks she's my daughter.

472
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:54,550
Well,if you ask me,she's a lucky girl.

473
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,280
Bummer for me,though.

474
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,560
Handsomest man in here,and he's taken.

475
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:00,290
I'll bet you do all right with the boys.

476
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,690
I do.

477
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,750
It's the men i'm interested in.

478
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,530
You just put it all
right out there,don't you?

479
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,720
I always try to hold a
little something back.

480
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:11,600
Oh,my gosh.

481
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:12,670
No,no,no,no,no,no.

482
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,490
Leave him.

483
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,420
No,but you know that's a

484
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,620
I know.He needs this.

485
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:16,430
Okay.

486
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,650
It was great meeting you,jay.

487
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,620
You,too,sam.

488
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,410
Looks like somebody really likes you.

489
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,120
What can I say?

490
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:22,890
I still got it.

491
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,880
I've been meaning to ask you
- Have you lost some weight?

492
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:25,620
Because you look good.

493
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:28,920
Wow,you have no idea what that
means to hear from you,jay.

494
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:30,150
Uh,turn it that way.

495
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,080
I thought this might cheer you up.

496
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,300
Da plane!Da plane!

497
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,650
Baby girl!

498
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:39,290
Look you!You even taught
her the catchphrase.

499
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,850
Jay,have you seen my new tattoo?..

500
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,490
- be in touch.
- Well,thanks so much for coming.

501
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,870
- Yeah.Thanks.
- Okay.

502
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:52,160
Okay,claire,they're
gone.You can come out now.

503
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:54,360
Claire?

504
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,810
Honey,I'm sorry I
said you weren't scary.

505
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:59,360
It's been such a long day.

506
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,880
Can we please just go home?

507
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:07,690
All right.

508
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:09,910
I'm leaving without ya.

509
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,390
So...

510
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,390
This remote you know how to use.

511
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:47,620
yes?

512
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:48,920
Phil,where are you?

513
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:49,910
Claire?

514
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:51,420
Where are you?

515
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:55,080
I came over to scare you,but then I heard
you showing the house to that couple,

516
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,380
so I got out of your way.

517
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:58,460
Are you at home?

518
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,110
Yeah.I got here ten minutes ago.

519
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,610
S
- so...So you're saying...

520
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:07,000
This call isn't coming
from inside the house?

521
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,340
What are you talking about?

522
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:08,930
Just get home.

523
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,100
The kids and I are hungry.

524
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,350
Yeah,hurry up,dad.

525
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:12,400
We miss you!

526
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,690
Miss you,too,buddy.

527
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:54,940

Trick-or-treat!

528
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,360
I wasn't really that scared.

529
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:04,090
Okay.

530
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,480
Hey,you never told me if you
hit those kids with that egg.

531
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,230
They blended into the crowd,but
there was a slow one with them.

532
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:20,600
He couldn't run so fast,and
I nailed him pretty good.

533
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,000
I warned you.

534
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,420
Okay,reuben.

535
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,960
Where are your cool friends now?

536
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:27,150
Not q-tipping your ear,that's for sure.

537
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,430
Okay,reuben.

538
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,810
This is why I never
hang out with cool kids.

539
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:34,880
Yeah,you rejected them,shortly after you and
your mom roller danced at the talent show.

540
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,260
We were robbed.

541
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,780
Couldn't have been the song you picked.

542
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,160
"wing beneath my w
-" ow!
