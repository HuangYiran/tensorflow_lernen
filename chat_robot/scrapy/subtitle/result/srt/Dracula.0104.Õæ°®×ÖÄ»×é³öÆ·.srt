1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:02,960
《德古拉》前情回顾
Previously on Dracula...

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:04,650
Daniel！
Daniel!

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:07,650
…Alecander Grayson…我的一切…
...Alecander Grayson...the whole of my world...

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:08,580
Grayson
Grayson.

5
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,090
我为各位展现  无线能源
I give to you wireless power.

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,150
实验出现了一些技术难题  先生
Experiencing some technical difficulties, sir.

7
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,840
- 我发誓…  - 我们见过？
- I'd swear. - We've met?

8
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,200
没错  我也这样想
Yes, I was thinking the same thing.

9
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,610
我到底需要在黑暗中呆多久？
How long must I spend skulking in the shadows?

10
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,974
我想如常人一样在阳光下行走  
I wanna walk in the sun like any other man.

11
00:00:25,975 --> 00:00:26,920
先生  太阳
 Sir, the sun.

12
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:29,530
见鬼
Damn.

13
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:32,220
你做我丈夫  我嫁你为妻
Be my husband, and I will be your wife.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,670
- 你在想什么？  - 想你
- What are you thinking about?  - You.

15
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,079
我在想Jayne女士
I was thinking about Lady Jayne

16
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,080
当然  还有她那猎杀行动
Wetherby and her vampire hunting, of course.

17
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,040
现在先知死了
Now that the seers are dead,

18
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,981
那他召唤他的族类
he will much more easily 

19
00:00:42,982 --> 00:00:44,680
就更轻而易举了
attract others of his kind.

20
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,340
不久  伦敦就会斥满祸害
Soon, London will be crawling with the vermin.

21
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:29,020
Jayne女士是个猎人
Lady Jayne is a huntsman.

22
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,320
看来恶龙会
Seems the Ordo Draco is more

23
00:02:32,321 --> 00:02:34,210
比我们预期的更有先见之明
forward-thinking than I gave it credit for.

24
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,310
诡异时光啊
Strange times.

25
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,250
相当诡异
Wonderfully strange.

26
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:43,790
- 你得杀了她  - 如果我杀了她
- You'll kill her. - If I kill her,

27
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,520
恶龙会只会找其他人取而代之
the Order will just send somebody else to replace her.

28
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,624
那你要断了你俩的联系 
You'll end it with her.

29
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:51,530
我为什么要这样做？
Now why would I do that?

30
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,640
因为她是吸血鬼猎人
She's a vampire hunter.

31
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,982
Renfield  我要做的不仅是
Renfield, not only will 

32
00:02:56,983 --> 00:02:58,320
消除她仅有的怀疑
I evade her slightest suspicion,

33
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:02,310
还要拿走她从未给过别人的东西
I'll take from her a prize she's given no other man.

34
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,010
- 她的爱  - 不是
- Her love. - No.

35
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,950
比这更珍贵的…
Something far more precious...

36
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,830
她的信任
Her trust.

37
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,480
订两个明晚的位子
Make a reservation tomorrow night,

38
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,550
八点  Savoy酒店
8：00, for two at the Savoy.

39
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,910
对了  要主厅里最显眼的位子
The most exclusive, visible table in the main dining room.

40
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,080
好的  先生
Yes, sir.

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,300
你好  主人
Hello, master.

42
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,080
根据腐烂情况来看
Given the extent of the putrefaction,

43
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,348
这个女性最年轻  
I say the female is the youngest, 

44
00:04:01,349 --> 00:04:03,870
被转五年  甚至更少
five years sired, maybe less.

45
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,579
而另一方面  这一个
This one, on the other hand,

46
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,075
明显老得多  
is clearly much older, 

47
00:04:07,076 --> 00:04:08,570
最少活了一世纪
a century undead at least.

48
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,055
就是说  这两个吸血鬼
I mean, that said, neither of the vampires

49
00:04:10,056 --> 00:04:12,800
都不足以杀死先知
are old enough to be the ones that killed our seers.

50
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,360
那逃掉的那个呢？
But the one who eluded you?

51
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:17,017
我猜是他们的创造者  
There, sire, I suspect, 

52
00:04:17,018 --> 00:04:18,200
比他们更年长
which would make him older still.

53
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,020
那是我们在寻找的吗？
Old enough to be the one we're searching for?

54
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,530
哦  他将是一个劲敌
Oh, he will be a formidable opponent.

55
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,684
- 劲敌？  - Browning先生  如果是  
- formidable? - If so, Mr. Browning, 

56
00:04:25,685 --> 00:04:26,984
就只有上帝能帮助你了
then God help you,

57
00:04:26,985 --> 00:04:28,414
因为如果连我都杀不了他
because if I can't kill the beast,

58
00:04:28,415 --> 00:04:29,280
就没人可以了
no one can.

59
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,050
Josef Cervenka啊
Josef Cervenka.

60
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,520
我的得力右臂
My right hand.

61
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:38,680
也许吧
Maybe.

62
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,140
都过去很久了
A long time ago.

63
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,520
胡说
Nonsense.

64
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,420
你将再一次成为我手下战将
You are once more under my battlements.

65
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:49,740
召唤你来是有原因的  很快
I summoned you here for a reason, and very soon,

66
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:54,780
- 我们就会摧毁我们的宿敌  - 恶龙会？
- we shall destroy our greatest enemy. - The Ordo Draco?

67
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,890
对
The same.

68
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,480
我已经发现新的技术
Rich men who've bet their future on oil,

69
00:04:59,481 --> 00:05:00,370
来摧毁
but I've discovered a technology 

70
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:02,280
对石油孤注一掷的大亨们
that will destroy them.

71
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,340
- 但他们比以前更强大  - 说确切点
- But they are stronger than ever. Precisely.

72
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,447
就在今晚  
Just this night, 

73
00:05:06,448 --> 00:05:09,030
我目睹我的两个幼类被猎人屠杀
I saw two of my brood slaughtered by a huntsman,

74
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,440
还是个女的
a female of all things.

75
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,410
所以我需要你的帮助
That's why I need your help.

76
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,240
我认识她
I know her.

77
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,660
那我们就把她抽筋削骨了
Then we will peel the flesh from her bones.

78
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,590
还不到时候
Not yet.

79
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,680
下饺子式的杀害不能将他们击败
We cannot defeat them by killing them one by one.

80
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,530
我们得直捣他们的权利之源  
We must attack the source of their power. 

81
00:05:28,531 --> 00:05:29,330
他们的财富
Their wealth.

82
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,020
像寻常小偷那样偷走他们的钱包？
To pick their pockets like a common thief?

83
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,536
那样毫无尊严  
There's no honor in that. 

84
00:05:33,537 --> 00:05:35,810
抱歉  先生  我听到动静
I'm sorry, sir. I heard voices.

85
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,582
Renfield  见见我的…
Renfield, this is my 

86
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:39,690
老朋友  Josef Cervenka

87
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,351
他想住这里多久  
He will be staying in this house 

88
00:05:43,352 --> 00:05:44,450
就住多久
as long as he wishes.

第一季 第四集

97
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,210
真让人吃惊
Such a shock.

98
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:32,570
小时候  Daniel就被诊断出心律紊乱
As a boy, Daniel was diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat.

99
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,660
我想发作  也只是时间问题罢了
I supposed it was just a matter of time before it gave out.

100
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,972
但是  这个年纪就死于心脏病  
Still, he was so young 

101
00:06:39,973 --> 00:06:41,080
他还是太年轻了
to die of a heart attack.

102
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,992
也许我应该感谢上帝
Maybe I should just thank

103
00:06:43,993 --> 00:06:45,700
让我们曾经相处那么久
the lord for the time we did have together.

104
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,134
我们要用牡丹和苹果花花环
We shall drape the walls and the ceiling

105
00:07:03,135 --> 00:07:05,580
装扮墙壁和天花板
with garlands of peonies and apple blossoms.

106
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,050
你一下如何  Harker？
What do you think, Harker?

107
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,950
哦  只要Mina喜欢就好
Oh, whatever pleases Mina.

108
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,980
我想给她一个完美的订婚宴
I want this engagement party to be perfect for her.

109
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,450
谢谢你  Grayson先生  你确定…
Thank you, Mr. Grayson. Are you quite sure...

110
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:16,400
当然
Of course.

111
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:19,340
我很荣幸来主办你们的订婚宴
It'll be honor to host your engagement party.

112
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,349
还有大烛台  
And candelabras. 

113
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,020
随处可见的银质大烛台
Silver candelabras everywhere,

114
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,682
置于桌上  
on the tables 

115
00:07:24,683 --> 00:07:25,790
点缀花饰
and in all the floral arrangements.

116
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,660
会有大烛台的
Candelabras it will be.

117
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:31,660
Mina？Mina  亲爱的  过来
Mina? Mina, darling, come here.

118
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,700
我来告诉你怎样出场
I want to show you how you're going to make your entrance.

119
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,300
马上回来
One moment.

120
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,663
告诉我  
I want you to tell me 

121
00:07:39,664 --> 00:07:42,280
你是怎样看Arthur Ogilvy将军的
what you think about General Arthur Ogilvy.

122
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,198
他好像积极的
It seems he's the military's

123
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:46,460
支持对奥斯曼帝国开战
leading advocate for war against the Ottoman Empire.

124
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,900
- 只是表面现象而已  - 怎么说
- Well, appearances can be deceiving. - Explain.

125
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,020
私下里  他反对战争
In private, he opposes the war.

126
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:55,532
真正的好战分子是副将
The real advocate is his number two,

127
00:07:55,533 --> 00:07:57,570
Colin Shaw将军  战争英雄
General Colin Shaw, the war hero.

128
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,390
深受公众拥护
Very popular in the public sphere.

129
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,492
额  这位战争英雄
Hmm, and yet this war hero 

130
00:08:00,493 --> 00:08:01,963
为了控制区域里的石油储备
is willing to spill

131
00:08:01,964 --> 00:08:05,320
竟不惜血流成河
an ocean of blood to control the region's vast oil reserves.

132
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,850
但Shaw将军坚信奥斯曼是个威胁
But General Shaw believes the Ottomans are a real threat.

133
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,048
你该不会以为
You're not suggesting he's

134
00:08:11,049 --> 00:08:12,980
他是为了个人利益而发动战争吧
advocating war for personal financial gain.

135
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,040
他是个傀儡
He's a puppet.

136
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,720
掌权者将身家性命
Powerful men have staked their fortunes

137
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,200
都压在了被视为未来燃料的石油上
on the presumption that the future will be fueled by oil.

138
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,379
看来他们不仅是对奥斯曼帝国宣战了
It seems they've not only declared

139
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:24,190
还想对Grayson能源下手
war on the Ottoman Empire, but on Grayson energy.

140
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,089
你和我  
You and me 

141
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,970
以及我们努力打拼的一切
and everything we worked so hard for.

142
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,400
抬头  Lucy
Head up, Lucy.

上次聚会那晚

180
00:11:23,134 --> 00:11:24,735

184
00:11:32,243 --> 00:11:33,743
就是铸造用的金属

195

196

谢谢你  Grayson先生

197
00:12:02,873 --> 00:12:03,973

00:12:04,007 --> 00:12:06,976
不  她就是Ilona

我妻子四个世纪以前已经死了

然后她转生
Then she has been born again,

202
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,884
命运把她带到您身边

203
00:12:14,918 --> 00:12:16,985
现在  你给我听着  Josef

213
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,270
选牡丹和苹果花呢
up to your neck in peonies and apple blossoms.

214
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,610
- 怎么了？  - 没事

215
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:45,000
听着  恩  我在重新考虑

恩  我觉得不自在
Well, I-I feel uncomfortable.

219
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,179
开销很大  
It's a huge imposition, 

220
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,220
而且  老实说

Grayson先生这样做的动机是什么
Mr. Grayson's motives for hosting it.

223
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,856
我意思是  
I mean, 

224
00:14:01,857 --> 00:14:04,160
毕竟你只是他的一名员工
you're just one of his employees after all.

225
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,700
我可没觉得自己就是个普通员工
Well, I'd like to think I'm a little more than just that.

226
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,780
恩  当然
Yes, of course.

227
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,270
我就是不知道为什么他如此…

在意我们？
In us?

229
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:16,513
他如此乐于关注我们的事
He's assumed this very intense involvement

230
00:14:16,514 --> 00:14:17,904
就好像… 
in our relationship 

231
00:14:17,905 --> 00:14:19,850
他也是其中一员
as if he's a part of it somehow.

232
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:21,697
恩  那是因为  
Well, that's because, 

233
00:14:21,698 --> 00:14:23,840
从某方面来说  他确实是
I suppose in a way, he is.

234
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,651
在我们分开的时候
When we split up,

235
00:14:28,652 --> 00:14:31,530
是Grayson先生把我拉到一边  
it was Mr. Grayson who took me aside 

236
00:14:31,531 --> 00:14:32,970
让我知道自己有多傻
and made me realize what a fool I was.

237
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,282
他让我认识你  
He made me see you 

238
00:14:35,283 --> 00:14:36,490
并且尊重你本身
and respect you for who you are,

239
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:40,730
你不仅仅是一名妻子  母亲
not just a prospective wife and mother,

240
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:43,480
也是和我一样
but a woman with aspirations every bit 

241
00:14:43,481 --> 00:14:45,650
有追求的女性
as important as my own.

242
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:47,610
他真的这样？
He did that?

243
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,370
是啊
Yes.

244
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:51,970
我本不想告诉你的
I didn't wanna tell you.

245
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,412
听着  我知道你讨厌这些…
Look, I know you hate 

246
00:14:57,413 --> 00:14:58,450
繁文缛节
all of this bother over arrangements...

247
00:14:58,450 --> 00:14:59,760
相当讨厌
Very much so.

248
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,840
那就让Lucy打理吧
So let Lucy handle them.

249
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,180
她就以此为生啊
She lives for it.

250
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,675
你所需要做的  
All you have to do is 

251
00:15:05,676 --> 00:15:06,840
就是准时在宴会出现
turn up on time for the party.

252
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,817
那这段时间呢？
And in the meantime? 

253
00:15:10,818 --> 00:15:12,170
埋头工作
Bury yourself in work.

254
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,830
说的对
You're right.

255
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:15,740
说的没错
Of course you're right.

256
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,120
批完这些卷子后
Once you have graded those papers,

257
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,018
就去校储藏室
you will find in university

258
00:15:30,019 --> 00:15:32,690
那儿有18只待宰羔羊

259
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,211
把每只的海马体取出来
Extract the hippocampus from each

260
00:15:35,212 --> 00:15:36,489
准备好了 
and prepare them 

261
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:39,300
给神经学的学生解剖课用

我几个小时后回来

263

别让我失望
Try not to disappoint me.

264
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,210
有问题吗？
Is there something wrong?

265
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:53,009
其实  我希望做点儿
Actually, I'd hoped for something 

266
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,860
不这么乏味的事
a little less prosaic.

267
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:59,330
Mina  我们必须得打好根基
Now, now, Mina. We mustn't get ahead of ourselves.

268
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:01,970
宁做勤奋龟  不做偷懒兔  是吧？
Better to be the tortoise than the hare, yes?

269
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:07,000
只要不做羊就好
Anything but the lamb, I suppose.

270
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:14,420
这是什么巫术？
What is this witchcraft?

271
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,730
是科学
Science.

272
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,371
如果成功的话  
If this works, 

273
00:16:19,372 --> 00:16:21,210
我们就能在阳光下活动
then we shall walk in daylight.

274
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,640
阳光下行走？
To walk in the sun?

275
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:27,230
你能想象吗  主人？

Yes.

286
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,410
没错  起作用了
Yes, it worked.

287
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,456
这就算成功了？ 
You call this a success? 

288
00:17:44,457 --> 00:17:45,810
你没看到吗？
Don't you see?

289
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,765
它起作用了  
It works, but only 

290
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:50,330
不过就只在注射的组织部位
in the tissue surrounding the injection site.

291
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,580
没传运到心脏
Without a functioning heart,

292
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,610
药剂就没办法散布全身
the serum cannot be distributed throughout your body.

293
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,275
我们现在需要的  
All we need now 

294
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:57,570
就是一剂分散剂
is a dispersion agent.

295
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:58,640
不
No.

296
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,507
问题所在  是生理上的  
The problem is one of mechanics, 

297
00:18:00,508 --> 00:18:01,370
而非化学问题
not chemistry.

298
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:03,123
心脏就只是一个泵  
The heart is simply a pump, 

299
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:03,840
其他一无是处
nothing more.

300
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,740
如果你能让我心脏运作起来
If we can make mine function,

301
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,130
问题就解决了  对吧？
the problem is solved, correct?

302
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:10,380
没错
Yes.

303
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,380
1880年

304
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:55,200
这些细胞是活的
These cells are alive.

305
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:56,790
所以呢？
So?

306
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:59,930
血细胞离体一小时就会死的
Blood cells die within an hour or so of extraction.

307
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:02,410
这个薄片是1887年的
This slide is dated 1887.

308
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,780
是九年前的了
That's nine years ago.

309
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,862
所以这是你为什么
And this is why you couldn't

310
00:20:05,863 --> 00:20:06,904
不去花店见我的原因？  
meet me at the florist?  

311
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:08,000
太不可思议了
That makes no sense.

312
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,211
我真不明白 
What I can't understand is 

313
00:20:09,212 --> 00:20:11,148
你怎么能对你的订婚宴
how you can maintain such a willful

314
00:20:11,149 --> 00:20:12,310
这么不在乎呢
 disinterest in your own engagement party.

315
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:13,830
什么？
What?

316
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:15,910
亲爱的Mina  有时和你说话
Honestly, Mina, it's like 

317
00:20:15,911 --> 00:20:17,310
就像和一个男人一样
talking to a man sometimes,

318
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,110
全心全意的
nose buried in whatever silly thing 

319
00:20:19,111 --> 00:20:20,470
埋头苦干那些无聊事儿
has captured his attention.

320
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:22,530
Lucy  怎么了？
Lucy, what's wrong?

321
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:27,800
我讨厌这样
I hate this.

322
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:35,210
Lucy  我…我不明白
Lucy, I-I don't understand.

323
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:38,010
你不会明白的
You wouldn't, would you?

324
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,700
你又不是那个一门心思
You're not the one attending to every detail

325
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:45,740
打理闺蜜奢华婚宴
for an extravagant party to celebrate the end of

326
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,380
每个细节的那个人
the only thing that's ever mattered to her.

327
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,710
- Lucy  - 真的
- Lucy.   - It's true.

328
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,650
一切都不同了
Things will never be the same.

329
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,720
我们永远是朋友啊
We will always be friends.

330
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,850
哦  Mina  亲爱的
Oh, Mina, darling.

331
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:06,490
你那么聪慧  却又如此愚钝
You are so terribly clever, yet so terribly stupid.

332
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:12,960
不  事实是你要结婚了
No, you are to be married, and that is that.

333
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,830
明白吗？
You understand?

334
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,180
不
No.

335
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,340
我不懂
I don't.

336
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:30,230
带上你的东西  咱去喝咖啡
Get your things. We'll go to the cafe.

337
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:32,450
太多事要讨论了
There's a million things to talk about.

338
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:43,060
对不起  先生
I am sorry, sir, 

339
00:21:43,061 --> 00:21:44,810
夫人马上就下来
I am assured my lady will be down presently.

340
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:48,210
那我一直等着
I have all the time in the world.

341
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:49,850
先生
Sir.

342
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:59,590
Grayson先生  真意外
Mr. Grayson. How unexpected.

343
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,690
我必须为昨天没去Savoy酒店而道歉
I must apologize for my absence from dinner at the Savoy.

344
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,774
虽然事不可免  
It was as inexcusable 

345
00:22:07,775 --> 00:22:09,150
但也不可原谅
as it was unavoidable.

346
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:11,610
哦  拜托  我都忘了
Oh, please, I had forgotten about it entirely.

347
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,343
希望今晚可以有幸相伴
I was hoping I might make amends by

348
00:22:13,344 --> 00:22:15,620
以作补偿
requesting the pleasure of your company this evening.

349
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:16,447
如果有什么
If there is one thing 

350
00:22:16,448 --> 00:22:18,364
让我特烦你们美国人的话  
I find tiresome about you Americans, 

351
00:22:18,365 --> 00:22:20,280
那就是你们不懈的乐观精神了
it is your relentless optimism.

352
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,305
我保证你以后
I promise you a spectacle 

353
00:22:22,306 --> 00:22:23,830
会难忘今宵的
that you will not soon forget.

354
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,240
好了  Grayson先生
Come now, Mr. Grayson.

355
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,210
想当然  像你这种富人
Surely, a man of your affluence

356
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:34,490
很随意就能找一个晚餐伴侣
can find a dinner companion for the evening.

357
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,480
确实
Certainly.

358
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,886
只是这特别的娱乐项目
It's just that this particular diversion

359
00:22:36,887 --> 00:22:39,560
普通女人可承受不了
is beyond the petty refinements of other women.

360
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:43,850
只有你有能力全然欣赏
Only you possess the sensibilities to appreciate it fully.

361
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:45,550
你这奉承也太明显了
Your flattery is too obvious.

362
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,406
奉承这种笨方法
Flattery is a dull blade that I

363
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:50,080
我是绝不会对你用的
would never employ against one such as yourself.

364
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:57,807
这活动  如果不能让我满意
This diversion, if it displeases me, 

365
00:22:57,808 --> 00:22:59,920
你就别再找我了
you will agree not to call on me ever again.

366
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,660
- 好  - 真的？
- Yes. - Really?

367
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,120
Elsa  厨佣
Elsa, from the kitchen.

368
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,490
哦  天啊
Oh, dear.

369
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:44,930
我想她没有近亲吧
I trust she has no close relatives.

370
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,040
和所有员工一样  
Like all our staff, 

371
00:24:47,041 --> 00:24:48,560
没人会发现她不在了
none close enough to note her absence,

372
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:52,120
虽然我会想念她做的苹果蛋糕
though I will miss her apple crumb cakes.

373
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,240
该死的Cervenka
Bloody Cervenka.

374
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:03,200
我已经询问了Shaw将军麾下三人
I've interviewed three men from Shaw's regiment,

375
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,415
两个政敌
two political opponents and

376
00:25:04,416 --> 00:25:06,350
一个被开了的军助
an adjunct who was dishonorably discharged,

377
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:08,299
没人说一句坏话
and none had a bad word to say. 

378
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,970
你好像很失望
You sound disappointed.

379
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:11,400
不  我没失望
No, I'm not disappointed.

380
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,284
我只是不明白
It's just I don't understand 

381
00:25:12,285 --> 00:25:14,790
为什么Grayson对此感兴趣
why Grayson's so interested.

382
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:15,969
我是说  坦白讲  
I mean, frankly, 

383
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:17,450
我从小就很仰慕Shaw将军
I've admired Shaw since I was a boy.

384
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:20,816
上学的时候
I actually chose him 

385
00:25:20,817 --> 00:25:23,250
我还拿他当传记研究对象
for a subject for a biography in school.

386
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:26,540
想知道一些相当奇怪的事吗？
Do you wanna know something very, very odd?

387
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:27,670
什么？
What?

388
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,698
从我最近做的调查来看
For all my recent digging, 

389
00:25:31,699 --> 00:25:32,820
只说明一件事儿
I've not been able to uncover one single fact 

390
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,340
就是并没什么发现
that I didn't include back then.

391
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,740
也许本就没什么可说的
Perhaps there is nothing more to tell.

392
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,580
也许吧
- That's why. - Perhaps.

393
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:46,660
告诉我  Szabo
Tell me something, Szabo.

394
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,100
你见过没有任何秘密的人吗？
Have you ever met a man without any secrets?

395
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:51,977
上周我自己
I've destroyed over half

396
00:25:51,978 --> 00:25:54,040
就杀了不止六个吸血鬼
a dozen Nosferatu in the last week alone,

397
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,180
他们都是被主人召唤的
and they are summoned by their sire.

398
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:59,500
我…我知道你对那个美国人的顾虑
Now, I-I share your concerns about the American,

399
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,260
但他现在不是我们面对的最大威胁
but he is hardly the greatest threat that we face.

400
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:05,500
同意  但我们也别低估了Grayson 
Agreed, but we must not underestimate Grayson 

401
00:26:05,501 --> 00:26:06,580
还有他的财力
nor the power of his purse.

402
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,610
尽管Harker和他  
Making inroads with his man Harker 

403
00:26:09,611 --> 00:26:10,640
只是个开始
is a start, but nonetheless.

404
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,120
没错  我认为Grayson值得查下
Yes, I think Grayson does bear scrutiny.

405
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:16,431
Jayne说的对  
I agree with Jayne. 

406
00:26:16,432 --> 00:26:17,600
就不劳组织动手了
The Order needn't be involved.

407
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,695
我会派人盯着的
I shall see to it personally. 

408
00:26:22,696 --> 00:26:24,680
很好  有消息通知我
Good. Keep me informed.

409
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:28,780
啊  我们的贵客来了
Ah, our distinguished guests have arrived.

410
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:31,610
欢迎啊  Shaw将军  Ogilvy将军
Welcome, General Shaw, General Ogilvy.

411
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,900
夫人  大人
My lady. My lord.

412
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,090
有请  先生们  请坐
Please, gentlemen, sit down.

413
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:38,120
那么  将军
So, general,

414
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,264
您保证过在三月份
you assured us total control of 

415
00:26:41,265 --> 00:26:43,220
就能完全掌控波斯油田
the Persian oil fields by March.

416
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,084
对  没错  但你也知道
Yes, of course, but as you may know,

417
00:26:46,085 --> 00:26:49,100
情况变得略微复杂了
the situation has become much more complex.

418
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,060
何以见得？  愿闻其详
How so? Please explain.

419
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,160
- 我能？ - 当然
- May I? - Of course.

420
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,360
自从苏丹颁布了法令
Our provocateurs have been

421
00:26:55,361 --> 00:26:58,460
规定退斩无赦
unable to foment so much as a border skirmish

422
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,006
我们的卧底就不能
since the sultan issued a decree

423
00:27:01,007 --> 00:27:04,250
随意煽动边境冲突了
to his men to stand down under pain of death.

424
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,584
所以你也瞧见了  
So you see, 

425
00:27:06,585 --> 00:27:08,744
发动先发制人的全面入侵
there's little we can do, 

426
00:27:08,745 --> 00:27:10,040
我们无能为力
save a full-scale preemptive invasion.

427
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,710
当然  议会也绝不会…
Of course, parliament would never...

428
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:40,850
深表遗憾  Show将军
My condolences, General Shaw.

429
00:27:42,204 --> 00:27:43,304
什么?
I'm sorry?

430
00:27:43,338 --> 00:27:46,773
Ogilvy将军上吊自杀了
It appears General Ogilvy hanged himself.

431
00:27:46,808 --> 00:27:48,075
他的属下明天早晨
His adjunct will discover him

432
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:52,980
会在他房间的浴室发现他的尸体
in the washroom of his quarters tomorrow morning.

433
00:27:53,015 --> 00:27:55,049
悲哀
Tragic.

434
00:27:57,052 --> 00:27:59,975
那么将军  我们什么时候
So, general, when can we expect 

435
00:27:59,976 --> 00:28:02,656
能开始进攻奥斯曼帝国?
to begin the Ottoman offensive?

436
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:05,258
八月怎么样?
Shall we say August?

437
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,495
好的  先生
Yes, sir.

438
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:11,531
就八月
August.

439
00:28:13,099 --> 00:28:15,334
这案子很有趣
It is an interesting case,

440
00:28:15,368 --> 00:28:17,803
需要发挥你的特殊才能
one which requires your particular talents.

441
00:28:17,838 --> 00:28:20,105
你的目的是什么?
What are your intentions?

442
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:23,509
找到Alexander Grayson在这世上的
Discover the one thing Mr. Alexander Grayson

443
00:28:23,543 --> 00:28:25,110
一件挚爱之物
loves most in all the world.

444
00:28:25,145 --> 00:28:27,212
嗯哼
Mm-hmm.

445
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:29,881
腐化它  毁坏它
Corrupt it. Deface it.

446
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:33,052
将它从世上抹去
Obliterate it from this earth.

447
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:36,021
组织知道你的计划吗?
Is the Order aware of your intention?

448
00:28:36,056 --> 00:28:38,057
他们知道我在调查Grayson先生
They're aware that I'm investigating Mr. Grayson.

449
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:40,224
请回答我的问题
Please. Answer the question.

450
00:28:40,259 --> 00:28:42,260
你和我一样清楚他们会怎样
Well, you know as well as I that if they did,

451
00:28:42,295 --> 00:28:44,347
我会被逼解释我的动机
I would be forced to explain my motivation.

452
00:28:44,382 --> 00:28:46,264
你是说
You mean your son's recent suicide

453
00:28:46,298 --> 00:28:48,633
你儿子殉情自杀?
after the death of his lover?

454
00:28:48,668 --> 00:28:49,668
拜托  Kleiberson女士
Please, Miss Kleiberson.

455
00:28:49,702 --> 00:28:52,136
我只是想澄清事实
I only wish to clarify the situation,

456
00:28:52,171 --> 00:28:54,305
那就是…
and that is thus...

457
00:28:54,339 --> 00:28:56,740
你想利用我
You wish to employ my services

458
00:28:56,775 --> 00:29:01,645
来执行未经批准的行动
in order to execute an unsanctioned operation.

459
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,815
我说过  并非完全未经批准
As I said before, not completely unsanctioned.

460
00:29:08,253 --> 00:29:10,721
我明白
I understand.

461
00:29:10,755 --> 00:29:11,544
这件事上
May I then rely on your 

462
00:29:11,545 --> 00:29:13,913
我可否完全信赖您会保守秘密
complete discretion in this matter 

463
00:29:13,914 --> 00:29:15,492
好让我另寻合伙人呢?
so that I may engage another contractor?

464
00:29:15,526 --> 00:29:17,527
不必要
That will not be necessary.

465
00:29:17,562 --> 00:29:20,130
我决定接手这个案子
I have decided to accept the assignment.

466
00:29:20,164 --> 00:29:22,232
就算未经批准?
Despite it being unsanctioned?

467
00:29:22,266 --> 00:29:23,734
正因为没经批准
Because it is unsanctioned,

468
00:29:23,768 --> 00:29:27,604
我要求双倍酬劳
I will require double my standard fee.

469
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,442
当然  包括支出
Plus expenses, of course.

470
00:29:33,911 --> 00:29:35,378
没问题
Of course.

471
00:29:47,257 --> 00:29:49,258
Harker先生吗?
Mr. Harker?

472
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,999
欲知真相  客运码头
今晚九点  前来见我

473
00:30:14,984 --> 00:30:18,286
似乎贵夫人今晚想见我
It seems Her Ladyship wishes to see me tonight.

474
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,755
详情未知
No details.

475
00:30:19,789 --> 00:30:22,223
真有趣
How intriguing.

476
00:30:26,228 --> 00:30:29,164
先生  Cervenka先生还要在这儿呆多久?
Sir, how long is Mr. Cervenka going to be our guest?

477
00:30:29,198 --> 00:30:31,332
我说了
You heard me.

478
00:30:31,367 --> 00:30:34,269
随便他
As long as he wishes.

479
00:30:34,303 --> 00:30:36,137
你有意见?
Do you have any objections?

480
00:30:36,172 --> 00:30:38,273
是的
Oh, yes,

481
00:30:38,307 --> 00:30:40,308
很多意见…
quite a growing number of objections...

482
00:30:41,644 --> 00:30:44,111
最主要的是他缺乏谨慎
Chief among which is his lack of discretion

483
00:30:44,146 --> 00:30:46,181
完全没自制力
and complete absence of self-control.

484
00:30:49,017 --> 00:30:51,185
没错
You're right.

485
00:30:51,219 --> 00:30:53,420
他很冲动
He can be impetuous.

486
00:30:53,454 --> 00:30:55,255
但Josef在战场上
But Josef has saved my life on the battlefield

487
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:57,758
救过我无数次
more times than I care to count.

488
00:30:57,793 --> 00:30:59,359
他与我情同兄弟
He's like my brother,

489
00:30:59,394 --> 00:31:01,595
胜似兄弟
more than my brother.

490
00:31:01,629 --> 00:31:03,964
他的忠诚毋庸置疑
His loyalty is absolute,

491
00:31:03,999 --> 00:31:05,566
也对我绝对服从
and he will obey my orders.

492
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,534
尽管如此
Nevertheless, he has demonstrated

493
00:31:07,569 --> 00:31:09,869
他的服从和忠诚
that his obedience and loyalty fall

494
00:31:09,904 --> 00:31:13,807
与他的本性相去甚远
a distant second and third to his nature.

495
00:31:13,841 --> 00:31:16,090
他不能被驯服  
He cannot be domesticated, 

496
00:31:16,091 --> 00:31:17,777
不能完全信任
nor fully trusted.

497
00:31:17,812 --> 00:31:18,778
为什么?
Why?

498
00:31:18,813 --> 00:31:23,283
其一  他知道你对Murray女士的情意
He knows your true feelings toward Miss Murray, for one,

499
00:31:23,318 --> 00:31:25,018
且知道其中渊源
and their origins.

500
00:31:25,052 --> 00:31:27,087
我已经让他发誓保守秘密
I've sworn his silence.

501
00:31:27,121 --> 00:31:31,191
我相信他会保守秘密
A silence I'm sure he means to keep,

502
00:31:31,225 --> 00:31:34,761
只是不知道他能保守多久
but only insofar as he's capable of keeping it.

503
00:31:34,795 --> 00:31:37,797
我担忧的不是他的忠诚
It's not his loyalty that worries me.

504
00:31:49,495 --> 00:31:51,129
真高兴你能来
I'm glad you came.

505
00:31:51,163 --> 00:31:53,597
这些最好亲自处理
These things are best done in person.

506
00:31:53,632 --> 00:31:56,634
什么?
What things?

507
00:31:56,668 --> 00:31:58,703
我对昨晚的宴会很开心
Well, I did enjoy our soiree last night,

508
00:31:58,737 --> 00:32:00,059
你的陪伴
and I do find your company, 

509
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:02,373
也让人十分愉悦
on occasion, most agreeable,

510
00:32:02,407 --> 00:32:05,343
但我必须结束这段关系
but I'm afraid I must terminate this relationship.

511
00:32:05,377 --> 00:32:07,244
早预料到了这悲惨的一幕
How distressingly predictable.

512
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:09,680
- 你说什么?  - 没什么
- Excuse me? - Never mind.

513
00:32:09,715 --> 00:32:12,115
- 我先走了  - 不  等等
- I'll be on my way. - No, wait.

514
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:13,116
我很好奇
I'm curious.

515
00:32:13,151 --> 00:32:15,419
你为什么觉得预料的这一幕
Exactly what is this predictability

516
00:32:15,454 --> 00:32:18,121
- 如此...   - 悲伤?
- that you find so... - Distressing?

517
00:32:18,156 --> 00:32:20,290
比起悲伤  更觉得是失望
Well, not so much distressing as disappointing.

518
00:32:20,325 --> 00:32:21,524
真的?
Really?

519
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:23,412
情况很清楚  
The situation is clear, 

520
00:32:23,413 --> 00:32:25,795
事实上  显而易见
crystal clear, in fact.

521
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:28,732
- 要我继续说下去?  - 请讲
- Must I go on? - Please do.

522
00:32:28,766 --> 00:32:30,200
你是一个以驯服男人
You're a woman who takes great pleasure

523
00:32:30,235 --> 00:32:32,535
为乐的女人
in asserting her domination over men.

524
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:34,671
然而  一旦驯服
However, once you do,

525
00:32:34,705 --> 00:32:36,639
你就对他们失去兴趣
you very soon grow bored with them.

526
00:32:36,674 --> 00:32:38,508
讲得很对  继续
True enough. Go on.

527
00:32:38,542 --> 00:32:41,511
自我们相遇
Since we met, you've made every effort

528
00:32:41,545 --> 00:32:43,112
你就想方设法驯服我
to do the same with me,

529
00:32:43,146 --> 00:32:46,015
然而你却彻底失败了
and in this, you have utterly failed.

530
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:47,049
噢
Oh.

531
00:32:47,084 --> 00:32:48,518
未能成功驯服我
This failure to dominate me

532
00:32:48,552 --> 00:32:51,688
使你对我感到迷恋
has led to you being infatuated with me.

533
00:32:51,722 --> 00:32:53,822
而这强烈的情感
Such is the intensity of your emotions

534
00:32:53,857 --> 00:32:57,360
威胁到了你的独立与控制欲
that they threaten your sense of independence and control.

535
00:32:57,394 --> 00:32:59,595
而再次掌握控制的唯一途径
The only way to reassert this control

536
00:32:59,629 --> 00:33:01,130
就是结束我们的关系
is by terminating our relationship.

537
00:33:01,164 --> 00:33:03,332
你太自恋了
Oh, you do flatter yourself so.

538
00:33:03,367 --> 00:33:05,110
你想要结束关系
Your vulnerability is evident

539
00:33:05,111 --> 00:33:07,103
就暴露了你的脆弱
 by your withdrawal.

540
00:33:07,137 --> 00:33:08,737
这样做真的很怯懦
I call your actions cowardice.

541
00:33:08,772 --> 00:33:10,472
瞧你这无聊的论调
I call your ploys tedious.

542
00:33:10,507 --> 00:33:13,642
你依然认为你对我毫无感觉?
You still assert that you feel nothing for me?

543
00:33:16,979 --> 00:33:18,781
完全没有
Nothing at all.

544
00:33:18,815 --> 00:33:21,249
先生  跟我来
Follow me, sir.

545
00:33:24,353 --> 00:33:25,954
- 先生  这边  - 今晚的约会对象?
- This way, sir. - Tonight's engagement?

546
00:33:25,988 --> 00:33:27,022
没错
I imagine so.

547
00:33:27,056 --> 00:33:28,523
他来的时候看到我也在
And does it give you great pleasure

548
00:33:28,557 --> 00:33:30,225
你是不是很高兴?
to see me here as he arrives?

549
00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:31,954
Grayson先生  游戏…
The game, Mr. Grayson, 

550
00:33:31,955 --> 00:33:33,128
都需要至少三个玩家
requires at least three players.

551
00:33:33,162 --> 00:33:35,797
总有一天  夫人
Someday, madam,

552
00:33:35,831 --> 00:33:39,600
你会发现我不是玩玩而已
you'll realize I was never playing.

553
00:33:48,444 --> 00:33:51,345
女猎人玩弄了你
The huntress made a fool of you.

554
00:33:51,379 --> 00:33:52,547
你知道什么
You know nothing.

555
00:33:52,581 --> 00:33:55,249
我跟踪了你
I followed you.

556
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:58,085
每个字听得真真切切
I heard every word.

557
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,886
谁允许你跟踪我的?
Who gave you permission to follow me?

558
00:33:59,921 --> 00:34:01,755
昨晚你回来的时候
I could smell her stink on you

559
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:05,993
我就闻到了她的臭味
when you returned home last night.

560
00:34:06,027 --> 00:34:07,861
我真不敢相信
I could never have believed you would consort

561
00:34:07,895 --> 00:34:11,498
你竟和这样可鄙的生物交往
with such a despicable creature.

562
00:34:13,501 --> 00:34:16,837
你不明白吗?
Do you not understand?

563
00:34:16,871 --> 00:34:20,139
我们的策略非常复杂
We have a very complex strategy.

564
00:34:20,174 --> 00:34:21,641
其中会有些让人不爽
Some of our tactics are distasteful.

565
00:34:21,676 --> 00:34:24,945
- 是恶心  - 也许吧
- Disgusting. - Perhaps.

566
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:27,414
但如果想胜利
But they are necessary 

567
00:34:27,415 --> 00:34:29,850
就必须这样做
if we are to emerge victorious.

568
00:34:29,884 --> 00:34:32,569
我们在玩一场危险
We are playing a very dangerous 

569
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,254
而不可饶恕的游戏
and a very unforgiving game.

570
00:34:35,289 --> 00:34:36,622
引诱他们的女猎人  
By seducing their huntress,

571
00:34:36,623 --> 00:34:37,690
把她从游戏中剔除
 I take her out of their game.

572

但这样行不通了
Ah, but not anymore

573
00:34:40,794 --> 00:34:43,363
因为她

我们是怎样在早餐前

我恳求您  让我杀了她

在这条街上走

但你的方法太鲁莽蛮干了

618

甚至把它引诱到你家里

00:40:17,106 --> 00:40:18,348
腼腆羞涩
so shy.

625

我驯服她了
I have sheared the tiger's claws.

626

却还不知情

631
00:40:33,897 --> 00:40:37,299
而你也一道儿处理了Josef

632
00:40:37,333 --> 00:40:40,035
妙哉
A masterstroke.

633
00:40:40,069 --> 00:40:42,937
没错
Yes.

634
00:40:42,972 --> 00:40:46,208
- 对不起  先生  - 没关系
- I'm sorry, sir. - Don't mention it.

635
00:40:46,242 --> 00:40:48,310
Josef是一名士兵
Josef was a soldier.

636

有时  你必须牺牲骑士

638
00:41:01,456 --> 00:41:04,458
才能俘获女王

639
00:41:08,363 --> 00:41:11,365
Josef  再见

644
00:41:50,837 --> 00:41:52,905
