我们将一视同仁

美国军舰科尔号

19
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:20,550
在亚丁湾港口加油时遭到袭击
while refueling in the port of Aden.

20
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,570
这是恐怖主义行动
This was an act of terrorism.

21
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,420
这是可鄙懦弱的行动
It was a despicable and cowardly act.

22
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,350
下面为您演奏的

整个事件就发生在我的眼前
It was right in front of my eyes,

26
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,680
而我丝毫没预料到

他们想时不时借用你的大脑

我要把你放回伊朗

中央情报局恐怖爆炸事件的策划者
The man who financed the bombing of the CIA.

57
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,710
我们已经谈过
We talked about this.

58
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,370
你得摒弃你那套冷战时期的狗屁理论
The need to wean you of your cold war bullshit.

59
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,980
这是可以扭转一切的行动
This is a once in a lifetime operation

60
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,310
一辈子就这么一次机会
that can transform everything.

61
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:16,270
扭转中东的整个局势
The entire Middle East.

62
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,700
你说得像嗑药嗑多了似的
You sound like you're fucking high.

63
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,890
你走之前我得问你件事
I need to know something before you leave.

64
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,810
我必须知道
I need to know...

65
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,730
炸弹是谁放的
Who's responsible for the bomb?

66
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:26,910
你知道他问了我什么
You know what he asked me?

67
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,600
谁转移了炸弹
Who moved the bomb?

68
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,280
如果是布洛迪干的
If it was Brody.

69
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,060
那他为什么那样问我
Now, why would he ask me that?

70
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,720
那似乎在暗示
That implies that there's a difference

71
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,530
该问题存在分歧
of opinion on that subject.

72
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,680
你应该知道是这个人
You should know that the man

73
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,930
放了炸弹  移动了那台越野车
who built the bomb and moved the SUV,

74
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,160
他并没有像他们说的那样死于爆炸
He didn't die in the explosion like they say.

75
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,340
据我所知  他还在美国
As far as I know, he's still in this country.

76
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,190
什么地方
Where?

77
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,090
我不知道
I don't know.

78
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,070
谁知道
Who does?

79
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:49,070
就是促成我们会面的人
The man that brought us together.

80
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,320
是你的律师  是本尼特吗
Your lawyer? Bennett?

81
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,810
你怎么这么殷勤  我都开始担心了
What happened to you? I started to get worried.

82
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,300
好久没机会表现  都生疏了
I'm out of practice.

83
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,130

This looks delicious, Saul.

84
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,230
谢谢
Thank you.

85
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,280
我给你倒杯茶吧
Can I pour you a cup of tea?

86
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,640
好
Please.

87
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,020
你哪里弄到的
Where did you get these from?

88
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,580
这不就是我们
Aren't these the mugs

89
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,470
从菲律宾带回的杯子吗
we brought back from the Philippines?

90
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,920
最后的一对
The very last pair.

91
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,400
等事情彻底了结
When this is all over,

92
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:01,990
我想再回蘇祿海上那座小岛
I'd like to go back to that island on the Sulu Sea.

93
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,490
你不必有什么承诺
You know, you don't have to promise anything.

94
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,350
真的  我都明白
Really. I understand.

95
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,150
干嘛不呢
No, I don't see why not.

96
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,530
我们可以开开心心
We might actually have fun.

97
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,720
好吧  毕竟看目前情况
Well, the evidence does seem to indicate

98
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,750
确实有可能成行
that that is possible after all.

99
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,440
你今天可以
Is there any chance

100
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,950
在家待着吗
that you could stay home today?

101
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,630
求之不得
There's nothing I'd rather do.

102
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,020
不过
But?

103
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,490
不过早晨得去趟白宫
I got a meeting with Mike Higgins

104
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,290
我和麦克·希金斯有个会
this morning at the white house.

105
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,860
-几点  -九点半
- When? - 9:30.

106
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,880
那我看咱们还有
Well, that gives us an hour and a half...

107
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,220
一个半小时
by my count.

108
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,820
那当然
Yes, it does.

109
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,190
这儿有点问题
Okay, here's something.

110
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,020
马克西米利安·阿齐兹博士  约旦人
Dr. Maximillian Aziz, Jordanian,

111
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,790
爆炸发生时曾在会场
was actually in the auditorium the time the bomb went off.

112
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,580
外勤还是内勤
Ops or intelligence?

113
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,380
内勤  分析跨国事务
Intelligence-- office of transnational issues.

114
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,550
和利兰·本尼特什么关系
And what's his connection to Leland Bennett?

115
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,830
他搞了个长篇大论
He wrote a lengthy analysis

116
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,690
研究他们公司背后那些小客户
of the firm's hip-pocket clients.

117
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,760
伊朗  叙利亚  阿塞拜疆的
Iran, Syria, Azerbaijan.

118
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,390
不过是两年前
This was two years ago.

119
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,130
基本不符合条件啊
It hardly fits the profile.

120
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,940
受过训吗  有没有爆破经历
Any munitions training? Experience with explosives?

121
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,460
没有
Uh... No.

122
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,360
好吧  先加进名单里
All right, add him to the list anyway.

123
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,720
行吧  但我还是想问问
Yeah, which begs the question--

124
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,400
真能确定是那炸弹客挪了布洛迪的车吗
are we even sure that the guy who made the bomb moved Brody's car?

125
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,450
-看怎么讲了  -怎么讲
- Depends. - On what?

126
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,180
得看你信不信贾瓦迪
On whether or not you believe Javadi.

127
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:46,770
反正你信
Which you do.

128
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:49,020
我是信  但是光凭想当然
Which I do. But it takes more than an opinion

129
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,680
可没法向索尔交待
to put it in front of Saul.

130
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:51,790
没错
Right.

131
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:55,580
但我总觉得咱这是在撞大运
You know, I can't help but feel we're spinning our wheels here.

132
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,520
这材料都快被调查局翻烂了
The FBI have been through these files a hundred times.

133
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,980
那天在总部的每一个人
Anybody that was at Langley that day

134
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,600
都被从头到脚查了一遍
has been turned inside-out and upside-down.

135
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,100
是  但那场爆炸肯定是现场某人搞的
Yeah, well, someone who was at Langley that day did the bombing.

136
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:13,460
我还是接受不了他们都死掉了
I still can't believe all these people are gone.

137
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:16,770
我也是
Yeah.

138
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,560
法拉哪儿去了
Where's Fara anyway?

139
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,680
她一个多小时前就该过来
She was supposed to be here over an hour ago.

140
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:15,450
{\an8}机密

141
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,000
请进  索尔
Come on in, Saul. 

142
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,890
你好麦克  见到你很高兴
Hey, Mike. Good to see you.

143
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,950
参议员
Senator?

144
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:34,590
好吧
Yeah.

145
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,630
参议员的控诉相当严厉
The senator's made some serious allegations.

146
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,810
具体是
Which are?

147
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,450
说你把贾瓦迪藏进我们本土的安全屋
That you had Majid Javadi in a safe house, on American soil

148
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:43,690
还送他出境
and let him go.

149
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,030
这是真的吗
Do you contest that?

150
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,150
也是  也不是
Yes and no.

151
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,930
是怎么讲
What's the yes?

152
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,540
我根本不知晓有任何
I'm not aware of any standing order

153
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,350
逮捕贾瓦迪上校的指令
to arrest Colonel Javadi.

154
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:54,910
-那你羁押他没有  -羁押了
- Did you have him in custody or not? - I did.

155
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,820
我操他妈的  索尔
Aw, Jesus fucking Christ, Saul.

156
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,560
我们不光是送他走  麦克
We didn't just "Let him go," Mike.

157
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,040
还盘问了他
We debriefed him.

158
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,620
策反了他
Turned him.

159
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,460
才把他送回德黑兰
Sent him back to Iran.

160
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,900
策反了他
You turned him?

161
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,240
他是我们的人了
He's ours.

162
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,630
没法保证他会真的合作
With no guarantee that he'll actually cooperate.

163
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,200
他会的
He will.

164
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,450
你怎么知道
How do you know?

165
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,930
因为我了解他
Because I know the man.

166
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,500
因为他知道游戏规则
Because he knows the game.

167
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,590
这完全是一厢情愿
That is total speculation.

168
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:16,840
他说得对
He's right.

169
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,890
最近这个部门的工作
We haven't had a whole lot of success

170
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,060
基本没什么成果
in that department lately. 

171
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,870
现在有了  贾瓦迪是中情局史上
Well, we have now. Javadi's the highest placed CIA asset

172
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,150
最有价值的线人
in the history of the agency.

173
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:27,300
他指挥了总部爆炸案  还提供资金
He ordered and financed the attack on Langley.

174
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,380
那再好不过了  没人会怀疑他
All the better if he did. He's above suspicion.

175
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,420
公开的抓捕会给伊斯兰领袖们
A high-profile arrest would've sent a clear message

176
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,560
一个明确的信息
to the mullahs.

177
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,350
都他妈歇菜
Back the fuck down.

178
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,540
但有了线人能让我们了解
Instead we have a live source, keeping us current

179
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,120
伊朗核武器的最新进展
on Iran's pursuit of a nuclear weapon,

180
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,570
还有全球真主党的行动
on hezbollah operations all over the globe.

181
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,400
这事我怎么毫不知情
How come I never saw a finding on this?

182
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,080
我们在现场对事件做出反应
We were responding to events on the ground.

183
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,870
必须当场做出决定
The call had to be made in real time.

184
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,650
他心知肚明  这就是鬼扯
That is horseshit, and he knows it.

185
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,540
迈克  该把参议员请走了
Mike, I think it's time you excuse the senator.

186
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,780
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

187
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,200
我是来向幕僚长
I called this meeting to brief

188
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:59,200
汇报任务第二阶段的计划
the chief of staff on the second phase of the mission.

189
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,870
那你说啊
So, go ahead.

190
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,080
不行  你在场我不能说
I can't. Not with you present. 

191
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,760
为什么
Why not?

192
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,850
因为你的密级比"行动级"还低一个等级
Because your security clearance is one level below operational.

193
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,360
你看到他这幅德行了吧
You see what I'm dealing with?

194
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,480
这人根本不服管  失去控制了
The man is out of hand and out of control.

195
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,860
这件事他是对的
And in this case, he's correct.

196
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,130
抱歉  参议员
I'm sorry, senator.

197
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:14,670
迈克  还有九天
Mike, in nine days,

198
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,310
我就要做局长了
I'm the next DCI.

199
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:18,210
所以九天后  索尔就会告诉你
And in nine days, Saul will brief you

200
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:19,740
你需要知道的一切
on whatever you need to know.

201
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,940
但在那之前不行
But not until then. 

202
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,380
-迈克  -参议员
- Mike... - Senator.

203
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,190
-迈克  -参议员  请离开
- Mike? - Senator, please.

204
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,630
该死的  索尔
Goddamn it, Saul.

205
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,970
过去一个半月
I spent the last month and a half 

206
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:41,130
我都在给你俩牵线搭桥
arranging a marriage between you two.

207
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,920
我出局了  我知道
I'm out, I know that.

208
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,230
现在成定局了
You are now.

209
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,120
本来不必如此的
You didn't need to be.

210
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,810
为了贾瓦迪  也值了
Javadi was worth it.

211
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:55,790
算了  跟我说第二阶段的计划吧
All right, tell me about this phase two.

212
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:12,340
政权更迭吗
Regime change?

213
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,570
这是最后
Eventually.

214
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,050
我们还在准备
We're setting the stage.

215
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:16,710
怎么做
How?

216
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:19,750
首先我们让贾瓦迪在军方提升为
First we move Javadi up the chain of command

217
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,080
高级将领
into a senior military position.

218
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:23,450
怎么做到
How?!

219
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:24,670
继续看
Keep reading.

220
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,470
抱歉我迟到了
Sorry I'm late.

221
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,740
路上堵车
Traffic.

222
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,920
我给你点了杯玛奇朵  但估计都凉了
I ordered you a macchiato, but it's probably cold by now.

223
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,650
谢谢
Thank you.

224
00:10:58,940 --> 00:10:59,900
没关系
It's fine.

225
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:01,450
我收到你短信了
So I got your text.

226
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:03,180
一切都好吗
Everything okay?

227
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,200
都好
Yes.

228
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,860
不好
No.

229
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,230
是...索尔
It's... Saul.

230
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,710
他怎么了
What about him?

231
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,930
我们做了个决定
We've made a decision.

232
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,920
是我做了个决定
Well, I-I've made a decision.

233
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,440
再给我们的婚姻一次机会
To give the marriage another chance.

234
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,490
我...
I...

235
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,900
要知道  做出这决定我也不容易
You have to know, it's not easy for me.

236
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:32,060
那你是什么时候决定的
And when, uh, did you decide all this?

237
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,660
昨晚
Last night.

238
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,060
恕我直言  我们昨天还在丽思卡尔顿酒店的套房里
Forgive me, but didn't we just spend yesterday

239
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,910
翻云覆雨
in a suite at the Ritz Carlton?

240
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,750
这是怎么回事
What's changed?

241
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:48,220
我刚跟你说了
I-I just told you.

242
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,530
怎么  你和索尔突然
What, suddenly Saul and you

243
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:51,200
决定和好了吗
have decided to reconcile?

244
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,750
不是事发突然
It's not suddenly.

245
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:55,330
过去两个月我们一直在谈这事
We've been talking about it for the last two months.

246
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,560
你懂的
You know that.

247
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:57,950
我之前还以为
Well, I was under the impression

248
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,630
你已经放弃了
That you had given up on that.

249
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,100
你们都放弃了
That you both had.

250
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,190
我也不清楚  也许吧
Well, I don't know, maybe we had.

251
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,080
那你有什么瞒着我
Then there's something you're not telling me.

252
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,090
我和索尔做夫妻都35年了
We've been married 35 years.

253
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:11,270
我爱你
I love you.

254
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:16,720
别那样说
Don't say that.

255
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,440
我很享受和你做爱的感觉
I love making love to you.

256
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,880
-我得走了  -米拉
- I have to go.  -Mira...

257
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,460
再见
Good-bye.

258
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,000
他签了吗
He signed off?

259
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,520
这么说吧
Well, let's put it this way--

260
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:36,570
他认为该行动计划有可取之处
He sees the merits of the operation.

261
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:37,890
所以他要让总统过目
So he's taking it to the President?

262
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,660
-是的  -可取之处
- Yes.  -Merits?

263
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,980
索尔  你他妈是个天才
Saul, it's fucking genius.

264
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,240
还得看能不能落实
If we can pull it off.

265
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,040
你什么时候出发
When are you leaving?

266
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,160
明天早上
Tomorrow morning.

267
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,730
卡莉知道你要出发吗
Does Carrie know you're going?

268
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,880
她根本猜不到
She can't even suspect it.

269
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,550
你们找我吗
Heard you were looking for me.

270
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,770
刚刚在看你和贾瓦迪的谈话笔录
Yeah, we were just going over the transcript of your debrief 

271
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,300
看看是否与
with Javadi to see if it supported

272
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,280
昨天他对卡莉叙述的内容相符
what he told Carrie on the tarmac yesterday.

273
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:00,920
结果呢
Which was?

274
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,020
当时移动越野车的嫌犯
That the man who moved the SUV

275
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,350
仍身处在国内
is still in the United States,

276
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,660
并且他和利兰·本尼特的律所有联系
And he's somehow connected to Leland Bennett's law firm.

277
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,540
什么联系
Connected how? 

278
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,210
还不清楚
It's unclear.

279
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,390
所以希望你可以指点迷津
We were hoping you could shed some light.

280
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,200
贾瓦迪从未谈及与本尼特的关系
Javadi didn't mention the Bennett connection.

281
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,130
那布洛迪呢
Well, what about Brody?

282
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,250
他提及过布洛迪吗
Did he mention Brody?

283
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,670
在什么背景下
In what context?

284
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:21,030
背景是他充当炸弹袭击者
In the context of being the Bomber.

285
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,080
他并没有详细地说
Not in so many words, he didn't.

286
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,260
那他怎么说的
Well, what did he say?

287
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:27,190
他说据他所知  布洛迪没有移动那辆车
He said as far as he knows, Brody didn't move the car.

288
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,640
据他所知
As far as he knows?

289
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,220
他对我不是这样讲的
That's not what he told me.

290
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:34,030
-好吧  -他很确定布洛迪不是元凶
- Okay.  -He told me definitively it wasn't brody.

291
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,280
你到底想说什么
What's your point?

292
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,930
他对你我的叙述为何不一致
Why would he tell us two different stories?

293
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:40,000
你是在询问我  还是质疑我
Is that a question or an accusation?

294
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:43,320
我只是希望你可以坦诚地回答
Well, I guess I'd like a straight answer.

295
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:45,760
如果贾瓦迪提及过布洛迪没有移动那辆车
And if Javadi even intimated that Brody didn't move the car, 

296
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,470
为什么不继续逼问是谁动的
why not press him on who did?

297
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,660
我估计你生气是因为
Well, you're angry because I didn't share

298
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,790
我从没和你谈过布洛迪  哪怕是私下里
a conversation with you about Brody. An inconclusive one.

299
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:53,550
不是  我生气是因为你似乎完全不在乎
No, I'm angry because you seem entirely indifferent

300
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,150
抓住真正的炸弹袭击者
to catching the actual bomber.

301
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,510
随你怎么说  我没意见
Speak for yourself. I'm all for it.

302
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,990
很高兴听到你这么说
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

303
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,740
这么说  你们俩
So... You two...

304
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,390
已经有计划了
actually have a plan?

305
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,980
是的  我们想把这家伙给引出来
Yeah, we want to flush this guy out into the open.

306
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,090
怎么做
How?

307
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,000
你和利兰·本尼特有来往  对吧
You know Leland Bennett personally, right?

308
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,950
我们一起跟国会议员打过几次球
We've golfed congressional a few times together.

309
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:20,130
而且我们都是北方基金会董事会成员
And we serve on the board of the northern foundation.

310
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:23,730
你能很随意的与他接触吗
How comfortable would you be making an approach?

311
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,840
非常随意
Comfortable enough.

312
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,200
这么早就回来了
Oh, back already?

313
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,870
是的  感觉不舒服
Yeah, I'm not feeling well.

314
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,110
你可以走了
You can go.

315
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,620
今天我来照看他
I'll look after him today.

316
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,380
你确定
You sure?

317
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,950
是的  他怎么样了
Yeah. How is he?

318
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,680
能坐起来了
Oh, sitting up.

319
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,720
有进步
Progress.

320
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,590
是的  就是有点吃力
Yeah, slowly but surely.

321
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:16,040
明天见
I'll see you tomorrow.

322
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,100
注意身体
Feel better.

323
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,380
谢谢
Thanks.

324
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:21,730

今天我待在家里
I'm staying home today.

326
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,120
[波斯语]

327
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,080
我需要理由吗
Do I need a reason?

328
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,290
[波斯语]

329
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,810
我不会丢掉工作的
I'm not going to lose my job.

330
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,340
[波斯语]

331
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,010
因为我确定
Because I'm sure.

332
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,810
说英语
Speak english.

333
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:45,940

说英语
English.

336
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,760
我来美国不是为了
I did not come to America

337
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,530
像个脏兮兮的阿拉伯人一样流落街头
to live in the street like a dirty Arab.

338
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,730
爸爸
Baba...

339
00:15:58,730 --> 00:15:59,690
听我说
Listen to me.

340
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,130
不会出现那种情况的
Nothing like that is going to happen.

341
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:03,050
不会有人把我们从家里赶出去
No one's going to throw us out of our home.

342
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:06,160
别担心
Don't worry.

343
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:07,950
我的工作很稳定
My job's safe.

344
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,350
银行的工作吗
At the bank?

345
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,490
是的
Yes.

346
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:15,100
在投行
At the investment bank.

347
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:18,820
如果你在投行工作
If you work at the bank,

348
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,140
我们怎么会这么穷
Why are we not rich?

349
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:31,180
里克特  这是个德裔姓氏
Richter. That's a German surname.

350
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:33,160
我父母出生在汉堡
My parents were born in Hamburg.

351
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,100
你会说德语吗
Do you speak it?

352
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,640
是的  当然会
Ja natürlich.

353
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,980
很实用
That's useful.

354
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:41,170
柏林有三家私人银行是我们的客户
We represent three private banking houses in Berlin.

355
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:44,760
能否给我们几分钟时间
Would you, uh, excuse me for just a moment?

356
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,820
当然
Of course.

357
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,450
你来早了
You're early.

358
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:56,890
我正在面试一位准合伙人
I'm in the middle of interviewing a new associate.

359
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,530
我长话短说
It won't take long.

360
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,460
上周基金会开会你没参加
We missed you at the foundation meeting last week.

361
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:04,110
没时间  工作太忙
Couldn't get there. Work.

362
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,090
应该为我们挤出时间
You gotta make time for us.

363
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:11,300
这个季度我多给你们一百万还不够吗
It's not enough that I've raised over a million dollars this quarter?

364
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,010
你了解我的  从不满足
You know me. Never satisfied.

365
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:18,250
不过  我今天来不是为了这事
But... That's not what this is about.

366
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,370
-不是吗  -不是
- No? - No.

367
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,390
我有不祥的预感
Sounds ominous.

368
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,730
我现在负责反恐工作  顺便说下
I do terror now, by the way.

369
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,710
估计你还不知道
I'm not sure you knew that.

370
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,330
我好像真不知道
I don't think I did.

371
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,890
最近看到有你们公司的名字出现
Your firm's name has come up lately.

372
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:33,310
还不止一次
More than once.

373
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:35,800
-好事还是坏事  -我不能说
- In what light? - That I can't tell you.

374
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,590
那为什么还告诉我这事
Then why tell me at all?

375
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,350
因为明天早上10点整
Because tomorrow morning at exactly 10:00,

376
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,610
我会参加一个高层绝密会议
I walk into a high level, top secret meeting

377
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:45,860
而你就是会议的议程
at which you are the agenda.

378
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,850
你想要我干什么
What do you want?

379
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:52,040
跟我们合作  实话实说
Cooperate with us. Come clean.

380
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,630
避免陷入一场即将升级为...
Get out in front of what's sure to turn into a...

381
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,700
极具伤害性的调查
a bruising investigation.

382
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,410
知道吗
You know what?

383
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:06,360
20年前的我也许会被你吓尿
20 years ago, I might've fallen for that weak shit.

384
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,610
但现在...
But today...

385
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,900
我随你怎么查
Come after me if you want.

386
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,750
我没什么好隐瞒的
I've got nothing to hide.

387
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,250
{\an8}一辆红色手推车

388
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,590
蜡烛是为谁点的
Who's the candle for?

389
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,080
所有逝去的人
All the departed.

390
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,370
你是东正教徒吗
You orthodox?

391
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,750
前男友
Old boyfriend.

392
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,750
听说他之后办过无数次喜酒
I hear the weddings go on forever.

393
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:13,010
喜酒的时间比婚姻还长  这笑话能乐一辈子
Longer than the marriages, so goes the joke.

394
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,910
本尼特先生需要你帮他查一个人
Mr. Bennett needs you to look into something for him.

395
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,470
我与马吉德·贾瓦迪合作  不是利兰·本尼特
My arrangement's with Majid Javadi, not Leland Bennett.

396
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,620
没错
Correct.

397
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,270
但本尼特先生今天得到的消息
But what Mr. Bennett heard today

398
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,210
也许会牵连到你
might reverberate onto you.

399
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:27,630
牵连我
Onto me?

400
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,490
需要我提醒你吗
Do I need to remind you--

401
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,670
你已被外国政府招募为特工
You're a recruited agent of a foreign government?

402
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,830
我见过贾瓦迪  一次而已
I met with Javadi. Once.

403
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:38,440
我同意做他的顾问  而不是做特工
I agreed to consult with him. I'm nobody's agent.

404
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,890
不知道中情局能否理解其中的区别
I doubt the CIA would appreciate the distinction.

405
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,140
你得到什么消息了
What the hell do you know about it?

406
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,950
我知道本律所因为某些原因
I know the law firm appears to be

407
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:46,690
成为了被质询的目标
the target of an inquiry of some kind.

408
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,810
这个我可不知道
Well, not one that I'm aware of.

409
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,450
这个警告是经私人渠道传出来的
The warning was delivered personally,

410
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:55,370
没通过官方渠道
outside of official channels.

411
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,490
是在局里工作的人吗
By somebody who works at the agency?

412
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,540
本尼特先生的老熟人  是的
A longtime acquaintance of Mr. Bennett, yes.

413
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:05,090
那你想让我做些什么
So what do you want from me?

414
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,810
确认一下这个报告
Confirm the report.

415
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:08,400
本尼特先生需要知道
Mr. Bennett needs to know

416
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,590
哪一部分业务处于调查之中
what part of the business is under investigation

417
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:12,780
以及他能做些什么以求自保
and what he can do to protect himself.

418
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,630
那可不容易
That's not going to be easy.

419
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,090
这么做的话不可能不让人察觉
Not without setting off alarm bells.

420
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,380
你会想办法搞定的
You'll figure something out.

421
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,630
让我想办法吗
I'll figure something out?

422
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,400
而且显然你的时间有限
And obviously there's a clock on this.

423
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,750
显然极了
Obviously.

424
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,710
喂
Hello?

425
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:57,170
见效了
It's on.

426
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:58,410
跟我说说
Tell me.

427
00:21:58,410 --> 00:21:59,360
我刚跟富兰克林见过面
I just met with Franklin.

428
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,820
他们开始慌了
They're panicking over there.

429
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,940
让他们慌吧
Well, let them.

430
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,980
等满24小时
Wait 24 hours...

431
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,630
然后用我们知道炸弹袭击者的消息给他们一击
then hit them with the news we know who the bomber is.

432
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,100
好的
Will do.

433
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,480
索尔
Uh, Saul?

434
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:12,570
什么
Yeah?

435
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,960
在那之前我需要一点私人时间
I need some personal time between then and now.

436
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,390
行
You got it.

437
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:19,300
-谢谢  -你没事吧
- Thanks. - You all right?

438
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:21,550
没事
Yeah.

439
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:24,660
我应该早些告诉你布洛迪的情报
I should've shared that intel about Brody with you sooner.

440
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,240
抱歉  我没考虑周全
I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking.

441
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,840
你死里逃生
You've been to hell and back.

442
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,640
我知道这对你有多重要
I know how important this is to you.

443
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:33,400
我欠你的  我们都欠你的
I owe you. We all do.

444
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,140
只要我们找到真正的炸弹袭击者...
Yeah, well, as long as we get the real bomber...

445
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,160
我们会的
We will.

446
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,180
是卡莉吗
Carrie?

447
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,920
是  你怎么知道的
Yeah. How'd you know?

448
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,010
你的语气
Tone of your voice.

449
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:56,830
你从不和其他人那么说话
You don't talk to anyone else like that.

450
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,750
我都没注意到
Huh, I wasn't aware.

451
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:00,680
准备开饭吗
You ready to eat?

452
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,320
要不要开瓶酒
Should I open a bottle of wine?

453
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:06,350
好主意
That's a great idea.

454
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:10,130
听着
Listen...

455
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:12,160
我得离开几天
I got to go away for a few days.

456
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,080
是吗
You do?

457
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,600
-是的  -什么时候
- Yeah. - When?

458
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:17,060
明天
Tomorrow.

459
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:19,870
索尔
Saul...

460
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:21,050
我知道
I know.

461
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:23,800
时机不太好
The timing's not great.

462
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,260
但你说只是几天对吗
But you said only a couple of days?

463
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:29,460
对  顶多一周
Yeah. A week, at the most.

464
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,940
一周
A week?

465
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,180
要不是我非去不可
I wouldn't be going...

466
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,590
我也不会走的
if I didn't absolutely have to.

467
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:42,300
我可以跟你一起去
You know what, I could go with you.

468
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,120
-那可真是太棒了  -谁说不是呢
- Wouldn't that be great? - Why not?

469
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,000
这不是什么旅行
It's not that kind of trip.

470
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:47,910
虽然我希望是
I wish it were.

471
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:56,470
-干杯  -干杯
- Cheers. - Cheers.

472
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:58,910
为我们
To us.

473
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,960
你觉得恶心想吐吗
You've been nauseous?

474
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,020
是的
Yeah.

475
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,870
一般来说现在应该已经没那感觉了
Usually that goes away by now.

476
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:11,510
我也是这么听说的
So I've heard.

477
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,210
我这里看的非常清楚
I'm getting a real clear image here.

478
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,760
你想知道是男孩还是女孩吗
You want to know if it's a boy or a girl?

479
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,040
不想
No.

480
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:34,010
很抱歉最后才来找你
Sorry this is so last-minute.

481
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:36,050
不  很高兴见到你
No, no, it's great to see you.

482
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:38,210
真是个惊喜
This is quite a surprise.

483
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,670
上周我还在院里见到了麦琪
I saw Maggie at the hospital last week,

484
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:41,110
她什么都没提
she didn't say a thing.

485
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,530
她不知道
She doesn't know.

486
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:44,390
这跟你为什么第13周
Does that have anything to do with

487
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:46,790
才来做第一次孕检有关系吗
why you're coming in for your first prenatal exam

488
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,190
其实我没打算要孩子
I didn't exactly plan this.

489
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:54,300
但你知道自己怀孕  已经有一阵子了吧
But you've known for some time.

490
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:58,810
用药情况如何
What about medications?

491
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:00,340
你现在在服用哪些药
What are you currently taking?

492
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:02,450
现在什么药都没吃
Uh, at the moment, nothing.

493
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:03,880
我知道
I see.

494
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:06,800
我孕前一个月服用过
I was on 1,800 milligrams of lithium

495
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,480
1800毫克的锂盐
for about a month there.

496
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,680
当时事情有点失控
Things were a little out of control.

497
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,580
更早之前
And, uh, before that,

498
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,970
喝了很多酒
There was a lot of drinking.

499
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:17,850
非常多
A... Lot.

500
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,430
在你知道自己怀孕之后吗
After you knew?

501
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,760
我还没想过要去弄一个育婴室
I haven't been painting a nursery,

502
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,180
就那么放在一边
just put it that way.

503
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:30,060
你是告诉我  你想做人流吗
Are you telling me you wish to terminate?

504
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,360
我只想知道测试结果
I just want to know what the tests say.

505
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,830
是不是都还好
If things are okay.

506
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:39,190
你缺铁
You're iron deficient.

507
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:40,040
这个我们可以补回来
We can fix that.

508
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:42,210
但是你的血压非常高
But your blood pressure's very high.

509
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:46,780
我的工作压力非常大
I've been... really stressed at work.

510
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,770
你真的应该放松一下
Well, you really should be taking it easy.

511
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:51,590
是啊  我会试试看
Yeah, I'll try.

512
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,410
卡莉  我们有办法
Carrie, we can manage this.

513
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:56,130
保证你和宝宝的健康
Keep you and the baby healthy.

514
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,140
并不神奇  只是一个过程
It's not magic, it's a process.

515
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:00,680
如果你想要顺其自然  决定权在你
You want to leave it to chance, that's up to you.

516
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,810
否则你就需要改变下自己的行为习惯
Otherwise you need to modify your behavior.

517
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:05,750
不是一周或是两周  或者方便的时候
Not in a week or two, or when it's convenient.

518
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,140
而是现在
Now.

519
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:13,570
我现在做的事和孩子父亲有关
What I'm doing, it has to do with the father.

520
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,340
我得把事情捋顺
I need to make some things right.

521
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:18,030
这关系到很多人
It matters to a lot of people.

522
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,500
但这不一样的  卡莉
But this is different, Carrie.

523
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,460
你现在已经不是自己一个人了
You're not on your own anymore.

524
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,130
法拉
Fara?

525
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:45,350
西拉吉
Sherazi?

526
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,160
你是哪位
And you are?

527
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,540
米切尔·克劳森总长办公室
Mitchell Clausen. From the I.G.'s office.

528
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,600
什么总长
I.G.?

529
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,910
总监察长
Inspector General.

530
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,680
我能进来吗
May I come in?

531
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,200
[波斯语]

532
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:58,420
[波斯语]

533
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,640
这边请
This way.

534
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,660
我可以给你弄点喝的吗
May I offer you something?

535
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,060
不用
I'm good. Um...

536
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,600
你连续两天打电话来请病假
You called in sick two days in a row.

537
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,150
是怎么了呢
Is something the matter?

538
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,160
偏头痛
Migraines.

539
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,160
可是你昨天开车去上班了
Yet you drove into work yesterday.

540
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:16,720
对
Yes.

541
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,230
你就呆坐在停车场半个多小时
Where you sat in the parking lot for over half an hour

542
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:22,190
还是决定走了
before deciding to leave again.

543
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,980
我那时候希望头疼能止住
I was hoping the headache would go away.

544
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,040
所以你才去了 
Is that why you then paid a visit

545
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,580
最近发生双尸案的
to 1426 Longhill Road,

546
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,250
长山路1426号吗
where the recent double murder happened?

547
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:36,170
贝塞斯达警局记下了你的车牌号
The bethesda P.D. took down your license number.

548
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,110
警局为了调查这案子
The agency had to call in a lot of favors

549
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:44,140
召集了众多帮手
to close that investigation.

550
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,290
你到那儿去会产生严重后果
Your going over there jeopardized all that.

551
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,790
我想看看案发现场
I wanted to see where it happened.

552
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:53,850
为什么
Why?

553
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:57,300
我很不安
It upset me. I...

554
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,770
我因此烦乱不堪
I was upset by it.

555
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:05,230
贝伦森局长对你表示出了
Director Berenson has shown an unusual degree

556
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:07,370
非同寻常的信任  西拉吉小姐
of confidence in you, Ms. Sherazi...

557
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:09,710
对你委以国家级的重要任务
entrusted you with matters of national importance.

558
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,000
那个我知道
I'm aware of that.

559
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:13,340
但是你目前的心理状态
But your current state of mind

560
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,780
使你对局长和中情局的忠诚度
makes your loyalty to him

561
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:18,080
都有待商榷
and to the agency a very live issue.

562
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,200
转告局长不用担心
Tell the director not to worry.

563
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:22,660
我很好
I'm fine.

564
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,700
明天上班的时候
You can tell him yourself.

565
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,830
你自己跟他说吧
When you come into work tomorrow.

566
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:29,730
行
Yes.

567
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,880
贝伦森局长
Director Berenson?

568
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,360
这个贝伦森局长是谁
Who is this Director Berenson?

569
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,610
他是我上司
My boss.

570
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:54,700
他不是银行里的人吧
But he's no banker, is he?

571
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,390
不是
No.

572
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:00,040
你依旧执迷不悟是吧
You went ahead, didn't you?

573
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,810
把我的话当耳旁风
In spite of everything I said?

574
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:04,630
爸爸  发生了恐怖袭击
Baba, an attack happened.

575
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:05,910
那又怎样
So what?

576
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,170
这又不关你的事
It's none of your business.

577
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,590
他们需要有国际金融背景
They needed Farsi speakers

578
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:11,020
又懂波斯语的人
with experience in international finance.

579
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,680
我必须帮他们
I had to help.

580
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,310
要是那些伊朗特工
And when the secret police find out

581
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:16,510
发现你为美国人卖命  那怎么办
who you work for, what then?

582
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,160
我们在德黑兰还有家人
We have family still in Tehran!

583
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:21,920
你的叔叔  婶婶  侄子
Your uncle, his wife and children.

584
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:25,620
到时候全部都要上黑名单  被处以绞刑
They will be added to the list of those to be hanged,

585
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,000
或者枪决
or shot!

586
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:31,880
[波斯语]

587
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,000
[波斯语]

588
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,080
我是美国人
I'm an American.

589
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:45,930
目标身份依旧不明  有可能就是
Target is still unknown, but presumed to be the man

590
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:49,140
在总部礼堂前安放炸弹的人
who put the bomb in position in front of the H.Q. Auditorium.

591
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:50,970
这是保罗·富兰克林
This is Paul Franklin,

592
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:53,600
现在拿他做木马  卡莉
our stalking horse. Carrie?

593
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,660
下午晚些时候  我会放出假消息
Later this afternoon, I'll promote misinformation

594
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,970
希望能唬住富兰克林
to Mr. Franklin in the hopes that

595
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:58,160
利用他引出炸弹袭击者
he'll lead us to the bomber.

596
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,380
如果计划奏效  我们见面之后
Our assumption is that after the meeting,

597
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,380
他会联系上头寻求下一步行动指示
he'll reach out for instructions.

598
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:04,460
也就是这个人
To this man.

599
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:07,450
利兰·本尼特  他们律所的一个大股东
Leland Bennett, one of the senior partners at the firm,

600
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:09,990
因此  本次行动从现在开始
which is why operation, from this moment forward,

601
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:11,670
针对这两个人进行
requires a full complement of audio 

602
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:14,500
全程音视频监控
and visual surveillance on both subjects.

603
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:15,640
不需要我再重申
I don't have to tell you

604
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,440
抓住这两个家伙的重要性了吧
what catching this guy would mean.

605
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:21,440
换句话说  就是不声张  不妄动  不露面
In other words, stay small, stay cool, stay out of sight.

606
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,560
好  开始行动
Okay, everybody. Game time.

607
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,320
你是对的
You were right.

608
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:03,610
快说
Tell me.

609
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:05,300
他们已经把总部爆炸案
They've connected your firm to the guy

610
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,970
牵罪到你们律所头上了
who detonated the bomb at Langley.

611
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:07,710
不可能
That's not possible.

612
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:09,300
就这么告诉你  信不信由你
I'm telling you what I found out.

613
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,140
好吧
All right. Okay.

614
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,440
他们还认为
They're also under the impression

615
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,790
那个炸弹客现在仍在美国
That he's still here in the United States.

616
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:19,190
是不是真的
Is that true?

617
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,570
回答我  不然的话
Answer the question, or so help me,

618
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:25,080
我现在就拍屁股走人  你别想再见到我
I'll get up and you'll never see me again.

619
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,940
放松点  卡莉   深呼吸
Take it easy, Carrie. Take a breath.

620
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:28,660
别把我当孩子哄
No, don't patronize me.

621
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,050
好吧
Okay.

622
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:33,640
是真的  他还在美国
It's true, he's here.

623
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,570
具体在哪
He's here where?

624
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:41,490
你这么问就是说他们也没掌握他的下落
I'm assuming that means they haven't located him yet.

625
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,410
对  他们还没掌握
No, they haven't.

626
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:44,420
那他们到底掌握了些什么
Then exactly what do they have?

627
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,990
以同谋罪带走利兰·本尼特
A warrant pending before a FISA judge,

628
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:49,170
面见外国情报监督法法官的逮捕令
naming Leland Bennett a co-conspirator.

629
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:52,140
这份逮捕令还有多久生效
How soon before the warrant's active?

630
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,890
至少要好几天
A few days, at least.

631
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:55,850
他们不会知道的  本尼特做事干净利落
They won't find anything. Bennett's clean.

632
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:57,070
他一贯假人之手
He works through a cutout.

633
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,410
就是你
You.

634
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:01,410
别掺和了  让我来处理这件事
Just lay low and let me handle this.

635
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:02,890
一直以来都是你在处理
You're the one who's been handling this,

636
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:05,820
恕我冒昧  你的话不怎么可信
so excuse me if your assurance isn't very assuring.

637
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,390
他们查到我们朋友了
They have a line on our friend.

638
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,120
他们是怎么知道的
How'd they get onto him?

639
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,180
- 不清楚  -那就去搞清楚
- No idea. - Well, find out.

640
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,830
有点太迟了  你不觉得吗
It's a little late for that, don't you think?

641
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,810
你确定不是你这出了差错吗
You sure it wasn't your mistake?

642
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,710
你确定不是你的错吗
You sure it wasn't yours?

643
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:45,480
我们当时被要求向一名与政府有关系的
We were asked to provide material support

644
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:48,360
美国公民提供物资支持
to an American citizen with ties to the regime.

645
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:51,440
并没有提及他与爆炸袭击案有关
There was no mention of his involvement in the bombing.

646
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:52,850
后来提到了
There was later.

647
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,780
你说得对
Yes, there was.

648
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:57,330
我们当时就该把这个问题解决好
Well, we should've dealt with it then.

649
00:32:58,050 --> 00:32:59,200
也许吧
Maybe.

650
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,710
他们知道他是谁吗
Do they know his name?

651
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:04,230
不知道
No.

652
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,290
那我们暂且没事
Then we're still okay.

653
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,680
你想让他离开美国吗
Do you want him out of the country?

654
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:09,930
是的
Yes.

655
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:11,780
最好换个新身份
Preferably with a new identity.

656
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:13,880
我该告诉他多少
How much do I tell him?

657
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,040
无所谓
I don't care.

658
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,600
把他弄出去就行
Just get him out.

659
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,370
富兰克林发了条短信
Franklin's sending a text.

660
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:44,110
告诉我
Talk to me.

661
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:46,050
是个地址  还有时间
It's an address and time.

662
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:48,780
凌晨一点半在林奇堡的美景汽车旅馆
Fairview Motel in Lynchburg, 01:30.

663
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,520
能查到他发给了谁吗
Can we trace who he's sending it to?

664
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,850
不行  他的手机上一定装了匿名软件
No, there must be an anonymizer on the device.

665
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:54,230
别担心  卡莉
Don't worry, Carrie.

666
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:55,720
只要我们盯住富兰克林
As long as we stick on Franklin,

667
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,200
你就能找到那个炸弹袭击者
you'll get your bomber.

668
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,660
他说得对
He's right.

669
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,510
我们派一支战术小队去汽车旅馆
We'll send a tactical team to the motel.

670
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:01,510
富兰克林一清理现场
They'll arrest the target

671
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:03,440
我们就逮捕目标
as soon as Franklin clears scene.

672
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:31,210
华盛顿特区交通部
D.C. department of transportation

673
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:33,850
告诫司机朋友们  由于市区街道封闭
is warning drivers to prepare for delays

674
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:37,370
从星期四至星期六做好延误准备
due to street closures downtown Thursday through Saturday.

675
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:40,760
官方称第十四街西北的南行方向
Officials say southbound 14th Street northwest

676
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:44,290
G大街与宾夕法尼亚大道之间的路段将被封闭
will be closed between G Street and Pennsylvania.

677
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:08,880
有情况
Here's something.

678
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:12,820
可能是他
It could be him.

679
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,020
没错  就是他  我看到了
Yeah, it is him. I've got a visual.

680
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:19,440
收到
Copy that.

681
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,300
他在干什么
What's he doing?

682
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:34,120
现在就在那干坐着
Just sitting there at the moment.

683
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,000
B小队  你们看到他了吗
Bravo, do you have eyes on?

684
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,800
我在屋顶上  监视着他的车
I'm looking down on the roof of his car.

685
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,010
任何人不许动
No one moves

686
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:43,170
直到富兰克林离开
until Franklin leaves site.

687
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:44,500
收到
Copy that.

688
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,490
他在给谁打电话
He's calling someone.

689
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,130
在监听了
We got it.

690
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:03,960
你来了吗
Are you here?

691
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,280
就在外边
Outside.

692
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,910
闪一下车灯
Flash your lights.

693
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:19,660
你在哪间房
What room are you in?

694
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,840
先告诉我怎么回事
First tell me what's happening.

695
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,800
你可能被暴露了
You may have been compromised.

696
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:26,900
他妈的怎么会这样
How the hell did that happen?

697
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,170
已经发生了
It happened.

698
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:30,000
怎么发生的有区别吗
What difference does it make how?

699
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:32,040
因为要完蛋的是我
Because I'm the one whose life is fucked.

700
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,710
要不是我先找到你
If I hadn't gotten to you first,

701
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,730
你就得蹲一辈子监狱了
you'd spend the rest of your life living in a cage.

702
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,850
你该感激我
Try on some gratitude.

703
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,470
你到底想不想收拾行李走人
You want your exfil package or not?

704
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:43,690
220号房
2-2-0.

705
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:45,030
这就来
Be right up.

706
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,120
操  他带了武器
Shit. He's got a weapon.

707
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,670
什么
What?

708
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:11,530
他在装消音器  天呐  你们看到了吗
Now he's silencing it. Jesus, you seeing this?

709
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:12,820
他有把枪
He's got a gun!

710
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:14,850
B小队  你能确定吗
Bravo, can you confirm?

711
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,570
不能  我的视野很模糊
Negative. My view is obscured.

712
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:18,970
他不是要带走炸弹袭击者
He's not exfiltrating the bomber,

713
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:20,140
他要干掉他
he's taking him out.

714
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,330
你没法确定  卡莉
You don't know that, Carrie.

715
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:23,230
装消音器还能有别的原因吗
Why else would he have a silencer?

716
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:25,810
她说得对  斯科特
She's right, Scott.

717
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:27,290
我看到武器了
I make the weapon.

718
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,070
我说了富兰克林要干掉那个人
I'm telling you Franklin's gonna kill that guy.

719
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:34,780
听我说  我们刚听到本尼特告诉富兰克林
Listen to me. We just heard Bennett telling Franklin

720
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,580
把那个家伙带出国境 
to get the guy out of the country.

721
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,400
或许本尼特改主意了
Maybe Bennett changed his mind.

722
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:42,340
不管怎样  我们得先确保让富兰克林继续行动
Either way, our priority is to keep Franklin in play.

723
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:44,260
那就任由他杀掉那个炸弹袭击者吗
So we just let him kill the bomber?

724
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:46,470
如果必要的话  是的
If necessary, yes.

725
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,360
我们之前不是这样定的
That wasn't the deal.

726
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,980
那个袭击者是唯一可以证明布洛迪清白的人
The bomber's the only way to prove that Brody's innocent.

727
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:53,760
可是制止富兰克林会暴露你的身份
And stopping Franklin now would blow your cover

728
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,080
还有贾瓦迪回到德黑兰的计划
and Javadi's back in Tehran.

729
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:58,330
你懂了吧
You get that, right?

730
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:00,660
在富兰克林离开前
Until Franklin is clear,

731
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,970
我要求全部小队停止行动原地待命
I want all teams to stand down.

732
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,880
全部小队原地待命  收到请回答
All teams, acknowledge standing down.

733
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,140
B小队  原地待命
Bravo here, standing down.

734
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,720
A小队  原地待命
Alpha team standing down.

735
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:11,110
卡莉  收到请回答
Carrie, acknowledge.

736
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,250
卡莉
Carrie?

737
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:23,530
卡莉  你他妈要干啥
Carrie, what the fuck are you doing?

738
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:25,490
卡莉  回到车里去
Carrie, go back to the van!

739
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,420
索尔答应过我  会让这个人活着
Saul promised me this guy alive.

740
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,420
现在这里不是索尔说了算
Saul's not calling the shots here. 

741
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:31,810
他答应过我的  该死  让他接电话
He promised me, goddamn it. Get him on the phone!

742
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:33,920
没有时间  回去
There's no time. Turn around!

743
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,650
卡莉  马上回去
Carrie, turn around now,

744
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,590
不然我们就要阻止你了
Or we will stop you.

745
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,570
这是对你的最后警告
This is your last warning.

746
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:42,230
听他的话  卡莉
Listen to the man, Carrie.

747
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,800
B小队  我现在授权使用武力
Bravo, I am authorizing force.

748
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,300
开枪射击  我重复一次
Take the shot. I repeat:

749
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,140
-开枪射击  -我来
- Take the shot. - Let me.

750
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,390
卡莉  我是奎恩
Carrie, this is Quinn.

751
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,670
快离开
Break away.

752
00:39:58,670 --> 00:39:59,930
对不起  我不能
I'm sorry. I can't.

753
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:01,430
你会搞死我们的  卡莉
You're fucking us, Carrie.

754
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:03,650
几个月的努力  你的努力
Months of work. Your work.

755
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,110
我不在乎
I don't care.

756
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:07,880
卡莉  我会开枪的
Carrie, I will take the shot.

757
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,250
要来不及了  看在上帝的份上
Window's closing, for christ's sake!

758
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:38,310
他进去了  富兰克林进屋了
He's in. Franklin is inside.

759
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:40,260
把她带走  赶紧的
Pick her up, for god's sake!

760
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,690
走  快走
Go! Go!

761
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,780
挪开
Move it!

762
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:13,460
我的老天爷
Jesus christ.

763
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,590
你当时磨蹭什么呢
What was the delay?

764
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:18,650
我拦住她了  不是吗
I stopped her, didn't I?

765
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:21,390
跟她一起走  我来监视富兰克林
Go with her. I'm watching franklin.

766
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:35,620
-接通医院的电话了  -告诉他们
- Hospital's on the line. - Tell 'em we got

767
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:37,280
有人左上臂受了枪伤
a gunshot wound to the upper left bicep,

768
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,910
大出血  可能是射穿动脉了
significant bleeding, might have clipped an artery.

769
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:42,030
坚持住  你会没事的
Hold on. You're gonna be all right.

770
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,420
真该死
Goddamn it!

771
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:47,120
妈的  他妈的
Fuck! Fuck!

772
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,870
-奎恩  -什么事
- Quinn... - Yeah?

773
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:55,210
那个炸弹袭击者死了吗
...Is the bomber dead?

774
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:56,650
-死了  -妈的
- Yeah. - Fuck!

775
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:58,400
他妈的
Fuck!

776
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:02,270
一定出事了
Something's going on.

777
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:03,680
-没错  你中枪了  -是啊  少废话
- Yeah, you got shot. Yeah, no shit!

778
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,950
你开的枪
You shot me!

779
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,510
不是  我是说出了别的事
No, I mean, something's going on.

780
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:10,910
这次行动...这次行动说不通
None of this... none of this makes sense.

781
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:13,560
呼吸  好吗  深呼吸  拜托
Just breathe, okay? Deep breaths. Come on.

782
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,870
过来
Come here.

783
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:21,750
近一点
Come closer.

784
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,440
索尔在他妈什么地方
Where the fuck is Saul?

785
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:36,740
您的旅途顺利吗
You have a good flight?

786
00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:38,940
还不错
Yeah, fine.

787
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,200
至少把我送过来了
Got me here.

788
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:53,320
这边走
Hey. This way.

789
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:55,960
在这里等着
Wait here.

790
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:22,170
再过一个月  这里会更热的
In another month, it's even hotter.

791
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:23,640
你想不到有多热
You won't believe.

792
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:27,370
或许我会用那一千万美元装一台空调
Maybe I use the $10 million to put in an air conditioner.

793
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,010
在那里
There.
