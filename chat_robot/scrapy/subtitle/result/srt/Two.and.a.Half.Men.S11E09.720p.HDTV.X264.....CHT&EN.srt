第十一季  第九集

11
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:06,610
我通常都沒機會在科技展上認識
I don't usually meet women as beautiful as you

12
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:07,730
你這么漂亮的美女
at a tech convention.

13
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:09,000
你嘴真甜
Aw, that's very sweet.

14
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,980
你也是會上最帥的帥哥
And you were definitely the hottest guy there.

15
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,920
謝謝  雖然說
Thank you. Although, to be fair,

16
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,840
當科技展上最帥的男的感覺...
being the hottest guy at a tech convention is kind of like...

17
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,610
就像是在科技展上當最帥的男的...
well, being the hottest guy at a tech convention.

18
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:22,910
不過有一次我看到賈斯丁·汀布萊克[男星]
Although, once, I saw Justin Timberlake

19
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:24,370
出席微軟的派對呢
at a Microsoft party.

20
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:26,720
一泡一個準
Lady boner!

21
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,540
他的確是為微軟8系統帶來了性感元素
Yes, he did bring sexy back to Windows 8.

22
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,840
你說你是在谷歌工作嗎
So, you said you work for Google?

23
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,830
是的  在模特[建模]部門
That's right, in the modeling department.

24
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,640
很不錯啊  是例如圖像渲染
Oh, that's awesome. Like graphic rendering

25
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,800
與3D制圖嗎
and 3-D imaging?

26
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,740
更像是在指手畫腳啦
More like pointing.

27
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,760
"谷歌全新推出
"New from Google,

28
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,330
理解無能的科技玩意"
confusing tech crap."

29
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,140
所以你是真模特
Oh, so you're, like, a model-model?

30
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,730
谷歌谷歌  "鼓"起來高歌
Yep. You can't spell Google without "Ogle."

31
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,720
對吧
Can you?

32
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,450
不對
No, you can't.

33
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:58,450
但其實我并不想在科技展上當模特
But being a model at tech shows isn't what I really want to do.

34
00:00:58,450 --> 00:00:59,770
只是為了賺錢糊口而已
I just do it to pay the bills.

35
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:01,600
我懂  那你的終極夢想是什么
Oh, I get it. What's your ultimate goal?

36
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,720
我希望能教人們識字
I want to help teach people to read.

37
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,640
好高尚的夢想  你想當老師啊
Oh, that's noble. So, you want to be a teacher.

38
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,240
我想當下一個字謎游戲的傳奇女主持
No, I want to be the next Vanna White.

39
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,360
你是認真的啊
Oh, you're serious.

40
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,010
對啊  你看她有一份好工作
Yeah. I mean, she has an amazing job,

41
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,130
總是穿得超漂亮  發型也超漂亮
she wears amazing outfits and she has amazing hair.

42
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,510
某人也超需要學個新形容詞啊
Somebody needs to buy a new, amazing adjective.

43
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:26,010
你不能買形容詞
You can't buy adjectives.

44
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:28,200
你只能買母音[節目游戲規則]
You can only buy vowels.

45
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,360
好的
Right.

46
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,650
只能賣母音
Only vowels.

47
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,730
我還欠你一杯飲料
Well, I owe you another drink.

48
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:37,000
O  K[猜字]
"O." "K."

49
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,360
今晚不會有I[我]進入U[你]的事情發生了
Certainly won't be any "I" in "U" Tonight.

50
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,480
那個妞真是美呆了
Wow, that girl is gorgeous.

51
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,780
她是個模特兒
Yeah, she's a model.

52
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,220
我們之間不來電
We don't really have a connection.

53
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,480
她腦子不太好
She's not very bright.

54
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,200
我覺得她會認為矽谷是一個
I think she thinks Silicon Valley is the place

55
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,490
女人去做矽膠假奶的地方
where women go to get a boob job.

56
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,150
你想要有智力上的刺激啊
Oh, you want intellectual stimulation.

57
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,920
那你何不一邊看著科研節目
Uh, why don't you watch an episode of Nova

58
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,190
一邊操翻她呢
while you're banging her brains out?

59
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,550
我要去跟她說我們不來電了
No, I'm gonna go tell her it's not gonna work out.

60
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,410
你不想上她  能讓給我嗎
Well, if you don't want her, can I have her?

61
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:08,880
行啊  我們互換衣服  她一定"認不出"
Oh, sure, let's change shirts. Maybe she won't notice.

62
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,520
她真笨成這樣啊
Oh, she's that dumb?

63
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,900
太好了
Great.

64
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,200
沃頓
Walden!

65
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,280
有海鷗...
Look, a seagu...

66
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:16,920
天啊
Oh, my God.

67
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,360
等等
Wait.

68
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,100
我們還沒互換衣服呢
We didn't switch shirts yet.

69
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,630
在干嘛呢
Hey, what's going on?

70
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,160
剛才在清理我的衣櫥
I was cleaning out my closet

71
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,810
發現了一箱杰克的舊東西
and I found a box of Jake's old stuff.

72
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,230
那挺好啊
Aw, that's sweet.

73
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,340
誰是杰克啊
Who's Jake?

74
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,790
我兒子  你堂弟
My son. Y-Your cousin.

75
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,400
對哦
Oh, right.

76
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,920
他是怎么死的
Oh, and how did he die?

77
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:56,060
他沒死呢  他參軍去了
Oh, no, h-he's not dead. He's in the Army.

78
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,430
好煙斗
Ah. Nice bong.

79
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:02,610
想必他打的不是抗毒的戰爭
Guess he's not fighting the war on drugs.

80
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,050
那是蜂鳥喂食器
No, that-that is a hummingbird feeder.

81
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,680
他在美術課上做的
He made it in art class.

82
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,920
手工藝課上  我也做了一個火車笛
And in shop class, I made a train whistle.

83
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,190
嗚嗚[大麻  大麻]
Weed, weed!

84
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,750
我不是開玩笑
No, no, seriously.

85
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,230
在他讀高中時的有一年暑假
Uh, one summer, back in high school,

86
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,630
他跟他朋友喜歡上了賞鳥
he and his friends got into bird watching.

87
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,760
他們會一整天都在森林里混...
They'd spend all day out in the woods, and they'd...

88
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:23,200
笑開懷地回家
they'd come back laughing and...

89
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,600
天啊  我真是個傻逼
Oh, God, I'm an idiot.

90
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:30,080
別擔心  所有家長都是傻逼
Don't worry. All parents are idiots.

91
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,820
我媽以前也以為我只是被反鎖在浴室里
My mom used to think I was locked in the bathroom all day

92
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,440
然后里面有只電動牙刷
with an electric toothbrush.

93
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,240
我第一任妻子也總是在用她的電動牙...
My first wife was always using her electric tooth...

94
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,180
天啊  我是超級大傻逼
God, I am an idiot.

95
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:45,910
你看  他以前的成績單
Oh, look at this. One of his old report cards.

96
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,760
還看得到他想偷換成績的印子
Oh, you can still see where he tried to change his grades.

97
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,950
他把所有的C
Yeah, he changed the C's.

98
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,040
都換成了D
To D's.

99
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,140
不過那年接他的校車的確換成接智障的小校車
Yeah. That was the year his bus got a little shorter.

100
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,480
不過  也不是那么壞
But, you know, in his defense,

101
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,000
他的老師那年也有變化
his teacher changed that year, too.

102
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,080
也從C變成了D[罩杯]
She went from C's to D's.

103
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,450
你晚上都是干這種無聊事度過的嗎
Is this how you're spending your night?

104
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,190
不不  等會我還打算刮背毛
Oh, no, no. Later, I'm going to shave my back.

105
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,630
如果你不忙的話...
Oh, actually, if you're not busy...

106
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,610
我忙  你也得忙
I am. And so are you.

107
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,230
我要去喝酒  沃頓呢
I'm gonna get a drink. Where's Walden?

108
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,070
他得把他的女伴送去醫院
Oh, he had to take his date to the hospital.

109
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,530
有東西卡在她身體里的哪個洞里了嗎
Ooh, what are they pulling out, and from where?

110
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:18,470
不是你想的那樣
No, it-it's nothing like that.

111
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,720
她當時在看天空  然后摔下了陽臺
She was looking up at the sky and she fell off the deck.

112
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,990
-嗑藥了嗎  -沒有
- High? - No.

113
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,110
-喝醉了嗎  -沒有
- Drunk? - No.

114
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,640
-模特嗎  -是的
- Model? - Yeah.

115
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,620
你還好嗎
How you feeling?

116
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,690
我沒事
I'm all right.

117
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,850
我們得填一下這個表
Uh, well, we need to fill out this paperwork.

118
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:36,480
名字是  納丁
So, uh, first name, Nadine.

119
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,170
這有點尷尬  我不知道你的姓
This is awkward. I don't know your last name.

120
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:43,880
是H  O  R  E
It's H-O-R-E.

121
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,720
H  O  R  E
H-o-r-e.

122
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,500
音似胡兒[歡呼]嗎
Like "Hooray"?

123
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,130
不  音似霍爾[妓女]
No, like "Whore."

124
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,890
你覺得我該改嗎
You think I should change it?

125
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:57,510
不  你該自豪
No, be proud.

126
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:01,480
這名字可是從你祖上流傳下來的  霍爾
I'm sure you come from a long line of... Hores.

127
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,380
你這里有親戚嗎
Uh, any relatives I can call?

128
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,990
沒有  他們都在東邊
No, they're all back east.

129
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:08,700
洛杉磯只有我一個霍爾[妓女]
I'm the only Hore in Los Angeles.

130
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,350
我還是保留意見吧
Agree to disagree.

131
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:14,850
緊急情況聯系人  沒有家人的話
Emergency contacts. Okay, so no family.

132
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,720
那你有朋友嗎  室友呢
Uh, friends? Roommates?

133
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,450
除了初次約會對象  有其他熟人嗎
Anyone you've gone on more than one date with?

134
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:21,480
沒有
Not really.

135
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,720
我一個人住
I live alone.

136
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,870
我來洛杉磯沒幾周
I've only been in L.A. a couple weeks.

137
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:27,320
我認識的男人只有你和弗蘭克
The only men in my life are you and Frank.

138
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,410
好吧  那弗蘭克的聯系方式是...
Oh, all right. How do I get a hold of Frank?

139
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:30,720
他是頭豬[壞男人]
He's a pig.

140
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,550
他是豬  你是霍爾[雞]
He's a pig, you're a Hore.

141
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,220
沒人會說三道四的
No one's judging.

142
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,930
不  它是我的寵物豬
No, he's my pet pig.

143
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,280
我的小豬腸
My little frankfurter.

144
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,830
一只豬啊
A pig.

145
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,320
他睡在毛毯里嗎
Does he sleep in a blanket?

146
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,200
是啊  他每次都會把毛毯頂起來
Yeah, he totally hogs the covers.

147
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,060
"頂"起來  說得好
Hogs. Good one.

148
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,160
當我沒說
Never mind.

149
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,750
那藥物呢
Uh, what about medications?

150
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,380
超愛的
Love 'em.

151
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,450
不是  我是問"現在有在服用其他藥物"
No, I-I think they mean "Are you taking any now?"

152
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:01,810
我相信啊  我有在吃治療抑郁癥的藥
Oh, let's see, there's plaxitril for my depression,

153
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,770
治療焦慮癥的藥
zaxaprin for my anxiety,

154
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,020
治療失眠的藥
dilapamin for my insomnia,

155
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:09,610
還有治療間歇性失控行為的藥
and clodex for my occasional bouts of rage.

156
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:11,910
誰都不喜歡憤怒的霍爾[妓女]
No one likes an angry Hore.

157
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,190
你怎么不早說咱們來的是同志酒吧
Why didn't you tell me we were going to a gay bar?

158
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,840
我要是早告訴你  你肯定不來了
'Cause if I told you, you wouldn't have come.

159
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,120
我肯定會來  而且會穿得更好看點
Yes, I would. I just would've dressed better.

160
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,400
不過先說清楚
And just to be clear,

161
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,070
你知道我不是同性戀吧
you do know I'm not gay, right?

162
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,590
我覺得你不是同性戀啊
I don't think you're gay.

163
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,730
雖然我也認識很多行為爺們
I-I mean, do I know guys that act less gay

164
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:36,560
但是會跟男人做愛的男人
that have sex with other guys? Sure.

165
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,520
不過我知道你是直男
But I know you're straight.

166
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,180
那你帶我來干什么
So, why bring me here?

167
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,270
你掃一眼這里
Look around this room.

168
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,170
-看到那些女人了嗎  -看到了
- See all the women here? - Yeah.

169
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,500
有些女人是同性戀  她們是我的
Well, some of them are gay. Those are mine.

170
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,840
剩下的就是異性戀
The rest are straight.

171
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,810
當然  其中也有一些是我的
Some of those are mine, too.

172
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,200
最后落單的那些女人
And everyone who's left

173
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,780
在打烊的時候就會喝得爛醉如泥  欲火焚身
is gonna be drunk and horny by the end of the night

174
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:58,630
然后會尋找那些不覺得陰道很"不好吃"的人
and looking for someone who doesn't think vaginas are yucky.

175
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,630
原來你是在說我
Oh, oh, you mean me.

176
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,900
好棒哦
Yay.

177
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,540
我是說  不錯
I mean, yay.

178
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,110
小心點
Okay, be careful.

179
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,640
小心腿
Watch your leg.

180
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,860
-你身上好香  -謝謝
- You smell so good. - Thank you.

181
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,040
讓我來嘗嘗你的味道
Let's see how you taste.

182
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,520
行了  行了
Okay. All right.

183
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,380
看來止痛藥有效果了
I see the painkillers have kicked in.

184
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,990
當然有效果
Oh, they sure did.

185
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:30,010
現在  你可以對我做任何事
Right now, you could do anything to me

186
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:32,000
而且我都不會記得哦
and I wouldn't remember.

187
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:38,160
剛我拋媚眼了嗎  我想拋來著
Did I wink? 'Cause I was trying to wink.

188
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,940
行了  你先去沙發上坐會吧
Okay, let's-let's get you on the couch, huh?

189
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,810
-那你在我身上"做"會吧  -好吧
- Hey, let's get you on Nadine. - Oh, okay.

190
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:47,190
行了  先  先歇一會吧
All right, fine. Let's... just rest.

191
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:52,360
真的很感謝你照顧我
Thank you so much for taking care of me.

192
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,860
畢竟  你斷了一條腿
Well, you have a broken leg.

193
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,720
而且沒有家人  沒有朋友
You don't have any family or friends

194
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,940
而且你住在四樓  還沒有電梯
and you live on the fourth floor of a building with no elevator.

195
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:04,210
我總不能把你扔在大街上吧
So, I couldn't just leave you on the street.

196
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,420
可以嗎
Could I?

197
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:09,250
-你好帥哦  -我知道
- You're handsome. - Yeah.

198
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,450
你...在流口水
You're... drooling.

199
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,790
我去給你拿點吃的
I'm gonna get you some food.

200
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:17,450
好吧  不過我飲食有忌口
All right, but I have certain dietary constrictions.

201
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:21,340
我不吃小麥  不吃乳制品  也不吃帶臉的
I don't eat wheat, dairy, or anything with a face.

202
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:22,670
不過
Although...

203
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:25,180
我可以為了你破戒
I would make an exception for you.

204
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,570
所以你跟侄女一起來的嗎
So, you're here with your niece?

205
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,780
是啊  她最近剛出柜
Uh, yeah, she just recently came out of the closet

206
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,130
而且她非常害羞
and she's painfully shy.

207
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,780
這才叫母乳喂養[吮吸胸部]
Now, that's what I call breast-feeding.

208
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,120
她還在慢慢適應的過程中
She's, uh, still trying to find her gay legs.

209
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,100
是嗎  所幸她叔叔已經完全適應了
Ah. Well, she's lucky she has an uncle who's found his.

210
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,030
不  我是直男
No, I'm straight.

211
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,780
為什么大家都覺得我是同性戀
Why does everybody think I'm gay?

212
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,830
哎喲  這個好酸哦
Oh, that is way too tart.

213
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,250
寶拉
Um, so, Paula,

214
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,240
你是做什么的
what do you do?

215
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,300
我是個投資銀行家
I'm an investment banker.

216
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:05,060
那你能不能回答我一個一直想問的問題
Oh, okay, maybe you can answer a question I've always had.

217
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,840
提前取款[抽出]有什么后果嗎
What's the penalty for early withdrawal?

218
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,940
這要看情況
Well, uh, that depends.

219
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,520
你的"存款"有多大
How big is your deposit?

220
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,940
利息[性趣]多"起來"了
Oh, interest is rising.

221
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,940
其實呢  在"里面"存得越久
You know, the longer you keep it in,

222
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,870
"收益"就會越多
the bigger your reward.

223
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,680
可是有時  市場會"疲軟倒下"
Sometimes, the market collapses

224
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,700
而你卻也無力改變
and there's nothing you can do about it.

225
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,720
等一下  這段對話到底是性暗示
Uh, wait. Are-are we doing sexual innuendo

226
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,520
還是你在咨詢我免費的理財建議
or are you asking for free financial advice?

227
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,400
不能兩者皆是嗎
Why can't it be both?

228
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,020
其實  如果你有興趣的話
You know, if you're interested,

229
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,710
我在馬里布海灘有棟別墅
I've got a Malibu beach house.

230
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:41,030
如果你有興趣的話  我沒什么道德底線
Well, if you're interested, I've got very loose morals.

231
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,590
好棒哦
Yay.

232
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,420
應該是  不錯
I mean, yay.

233
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,660
剛剛好爽哦
That was amazing.

234
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,170
你不喜歡嗎  我可以做得更好的
Wait, it wasn't? 'Cause I can do better.

235
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,010
不  你做得很好
No, you were great.

236
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,700
謝天謝地  因為剛才就做到最好了
Oh, thank God, 'cause I can't do better.

237
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:09,350
不過有件事在上床前
But there is something I probably should've told you

238
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,710
我就應該告訴你的
before we slept together.

239
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,350
是有老公了  還是有性病
Oh, God, husband or herpes?

240
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:16,630
有個男人  他叫保羅
Well, there was another guy. Paul.

241
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,200
保羅  寶拉  肯定不容易分清
Paul. Paula. That must have been confusing...

242
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,530
是啊
Very, yeah. Um...

243
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:25,490
其實  在40歲以前
You see, for the first 40 years of my life,

244
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:28,050
我是一個叫保羅的男人
I was a man named Paul.

245
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:40,590
你看起來不像...40歲
You don't look... 40.

246
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,770
這么說  你以前也是個男人
So, so, you were a guy?

247
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:54,970
也有喉結和胡子嗎
With, you know, an Adam's apple and facial hair,

248
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:57,370
還有下面那整套裝備嗎
and the whole kit and kaboodle?

249
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:01,020
是的  那整套裝備我都有
Yep, I had a kit and two kaboodles.

250
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,820
那你怎么變成這樣了
So, so, how did you get that?

251
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,690
我是說  你用找人捐贈器官嗎
I mean, did you have to get a donor?

252
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,480
拿駕照要填以后捐不捐器官的時候
'Cause I've never seen that box

253
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,440
我沒見過有捐"那部分"的選項啊
to check on a driver's license.

254
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:14,890
事實上  是我把器官捐給別人了
Actually, uh, I-I... I donated my own organ.

255
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:17,320
我要做的就是切掉雞雞  懂嗎
You see, what they do, they take your penis, all right?

256
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,950
對準中央  一刀切下
They slice it right down the middle...

257
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,870
好吧  我蛋蛋具體經歷了什么
Okay, I'll-I'll spare you the details

258
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,710
就不給你講那么詳細了
on what happened to my balls.

259
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:28,060
我倒清楚我蛋蛋怎么了
Well, I know what just happened to mine.

260
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,540
我知道應該早點告訴你的
Look, I-I know I should have told you earlier.

261
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:34,510
我只是不想把你嚇跑  我真的喜歡你
I just didn't want to scare you away. I really like you.

262
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:37,620
我也喜歡你  我們有很多相似之處
Oh, and I like you. I mean, we have a lot in common.

263
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,640
而且比我知道的還"多"
Clearly more than I realized.

264
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,380
或許我該離開
Maybe it's best if I go.

265
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,710
不  不  不要走
Oh, no, no, don't do.

266
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:43,520
你確定嗎
You sure?

267
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,780
對啊  別走  我喜歡你
Yeah, yeah, no, I like you.

268
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,540
我只是在盡力消化這件事
I'm just, I'm trying to process this whole thing.

269
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,430
我是說  比如
I mean, for instance,

270
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:52,660
你的雞雞不會再長回來了  對吧
there's no chance it'll grow back, right?

271
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,410
就像蜥蜴的尾巴那樣嗎
What, like-like a salamander's tail?

272
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:55,380
不會
No. Uh-uh.

273
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,820
你不會有一天打噴嚏用力過猛
So one day you're not gonna, you know, sneeze real hard

274
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,760
突然把雞雞噴出來吧
and suddenly I'm dating a dude?

275
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,180
艾倫  我跟你以前的女人沒有區別
Alan, I am as much a woman as you've ever dated.

276
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,010
但是如果你不能接受我的過去  那...
But if you're not okay with this, it's...

277
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,280
不  不  算了
No, no, no, you know what?

278
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,530
我不會讓一點小事影響我們的關系
I am not going to let one little thing come between us.

279
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,090
我那"事"可不算小
Oh, it wasn't little.

280
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:16,110
寶拉  算是兩性關系建議吧
Okay, uh, Paula, bit of, uh, relationship advice?

281
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,660
沒有一個男人希望聽到
Uh, no guy likes to hear

282
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,290
女朋友的雞雞比他大
that his girlfriend had a bigger penis than he does.

283
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:21,930
你說得對
You're right.

284
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:23,300
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

285
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,570
保重身體[德語]
Gesundheit.

286
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,490
-早安  -早安
-Morning. -Morning.

287
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:40,600
媽的  培根沒了
Oh great, we're out of bacon.

288
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:46,760
裸體超模也沒了
We're out of naked Heidi Klum.

289
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:49,370
靠
Damn.

290
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,750
這是弗蘭克  是我女伴納丁養的寵物
That's Frank. He belongs to my date Nadine.

291
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,020
艾倫跟我說了
Alan told me about her.

292
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,200
就是那個被你帶去急診室的模特
That's the model you took to the emergency room.

293
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,510
而且是兩次  她稱之為我們的"定情地"
Twice. She calls it our "special place."

294
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,750
這是我人生中最糟糕的一次約會
It's the worst date of my life.

295
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,520
你撐爛了她的嘴嗎
Is her mouth broken?

296
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,050
不是
No.

297
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,380
那問題是什么
So what's the problem?

298
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,350
問題在于  我們不來電
The problem is, we have no connection.

299
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,180
如果不愛一個女人的心靈
How can I be attracted to a woman's body

300
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,880
又怎能愛上她的身體呢
if I'm not attracted to her mind?

301
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,940
聽起來有點像同性戀  不過也沒什么
Sounds kind of gay, but all right.

302
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:17,800
早啊  沃頓
Hey, Walden.

303
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,490
珍妮
Jenny.

304
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,650
廢柴[艾倫]
Zippy.

305
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,610
友情提示  有個女孩睡在沙發上
Just a heads-up, there's a girl asleep on the couch.

306
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:29,650
放心老板  我知道怎么做
Don't worry, I know the drill, boss.

307
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:32,380
給她500塊  搜她身上有沒有偷銀具
Give her 500 bucks, pat her down for silverware

308
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,450
然后丟進計程車
and throw her in a taxi.

309
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:35,930
什么
What?

310
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,200
抱歉  突然想到了查理
Sorry. Charlie flashback.

311
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,360
早上好
Morning.

312
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,180
這是一頭豬啊
That's a pig.

313
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,070
這是一只吸血蟲啊
Whoa! That's a leech.

314
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,950
說來話長  離譜的一晚
Long story, crazy night.

315
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:54,530
不管有沒有豬  你都沒我離譜
Pig or no pig, not as crazy as mine.

316
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,860
100塊賭我比你離譜
100 bucks says mine beats yours.

317
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,170
我跟一個曾經是男人的女人上床了
I had sex with a woman who used to be a man.

318
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:01,320
勝負見分曉啦
And we have a winner.

319
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,670
真的嗎
What, really?

320
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,770
我不相信你會...
I can't believe that you would...

321
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:07,980
不過轉念一想  也不出奇
Well, ah, then again, it's you.

322
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,010
隨你怎么說
Hey, hey, say what you want,

323
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,590
但她真的很懂怎么侍候男人
but she really knows her way around a man.

324
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:14,460
就像跟優秀的西藏向導一起爬珠峰
It's like climbing Mount Everest with a really good Sherpa.

325
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:17,220
是啊  但你不和西藏向導上床啊
Yeah, but you don't shtup the Sherpa.

326
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:21,150
怎么變性啊  那玩意去哪兒了呢
How did it work? Like, where did it... go?

327
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,840
很容易的  只需
Oh, that's easy. See, what they do is,

328
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,590
對準中央  一刀切下
they slice the penis down the middle...

329
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,720
沃頓
Walden?

330
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,230
我能不能洗個澡呢
Is there somewhere I can take a bath?

331
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:34,480
當然  在樓上  我來幫你
Oh, yeah, upstairs. Here, I'll help you.

332
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,650
不
No.

333
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:36,930
如果我什么事都靠你
I will never get out of here

334
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:39,390
就永遠不能離開這里
if I don't start to do things on my own.

335
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:42,920
除非你不想讓我離開
Unless you don't want me to leave.

336
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,500
樓上  左手邊
Top of the stairs, on the left.

337
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,530
這個女孩傷得太重了
That girl is really messed up.

338
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:50,320
我那位唯一讓我不爽的
The only thing wrong with mine

339
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,460
就是她偶爾新長出的胡須
is the occasional five o'clock shadow.

340
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,390
我要說  艾倫
You know, I've got to say, Alan,

341
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:57,240
你和一個術后變性人約會
you going out with a post-op transgendered person

342
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,590
而心中沒有任何偏見
without any judgment--

343
00:14:58,590 --> 00:14:59,690
我覺得很贊
very enlightened.

344
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,730
謝謝
Oh, thank you.

345
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:02,050
你該見識見識她的咪咪
And you should see her boobs.

346
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,150
一個叫霍爾[妓女]的打來電話
You're getting a call from a "Hore?"

347
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:14,550
喂  納丁
Hi, Nadine.

348
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,690
你把它卡到哪里了
You got... you got it stuck where?

349
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:20,020
不要動  我馬上過去
Don't move, I'll be right there.

350
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:25,490
納丁的護靴卡到樓梯扶欄里了
Nadine got her boot caught in the banister.

351
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,480
失陪了
Excuse me.

352
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,550
不用了  我搞定了
Never mind, I got it.

353
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:38,320
給個500塊加計程車費  他早脫身了
500 bucks and cab fare, and he'd be out of this.

354
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:42,050
真不敢相信我們這么容易就選定電影了
I can't believe how easily we agreed on a movie.

355
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:44,410
就是啊  男人和女人總是很難達成一致
I know, men and women aren't usually on the same page.

356
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,550
就是這里
Oh, oh, here it is.

357
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:48,600
三號廳  《茱麗婭·羅伯茨我愛你》
Uh, theater three, Julia Roberts in Hashtag: I Love You.

358
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:51,230
我去買汽水  你要不要來點什么
Listen, I'm gonna get a soda. Do you want something?

359
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:53,820
當然  我看看我想吃什么
Oh, sure. Uh, oh, let me see what I'm in the mood for.

360
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,670
想分著吃熱狗嗎[剪開雞雞]
Oh, uh, want to split a hot dog?

361
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,270
太對不起了
Oh, I am so sorry.

362
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,390
沒事
It's fine.

363
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,030
你好  麻煩給我兩杯健怡可樂
Hi. Uh, can we have two Diet Cokes

364
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,480
一份熱狗
and a hot dog, please?

365
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,360
不用了  我來
Don't worry, I got it.

366
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,520
好吧  但我習慣了男人付錢
Okay, but I'm used to paying.

367
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,690
這真是太奇怪了
This is... this is so weird.

368
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:14,850
對不起  這是保羅的舊習慣
Sorry, just, you know, old habits from when I was Paul.

369
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,620
我希望你沒有意見
I-I hope you're okay with that.

370
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,750
我想很明顯我很樂意
I think it's pretty clear that I'm willing

371
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,620
適應這段關系
to work around things in this relationship.

372
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:20,980
太感謝了
Well, I appreciate it,

373
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,970
因為我和你在一起很開心
because I'm having a great time with you.

374
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:24,250
我也是
Oh, well, so am I.

375
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,690
但往后  你得學會
Uh, but going forward, you're gonna have to learn

376
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:28,410
適應我的男子氣概  接受這個事實
to embrace my masculinity and, you know, accept the fact

377
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:29,660
我才是  謝謝  
that I'm the-- thank you--

378
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,250
這段關系里的男性角色
man in this relationship.

379
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,950
這里好冷
Oh, it's chilly in here.

380
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:36,330
給  外套給你
Oh, here. Take my jacket.

381
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:39,450
好溫暖哦
Oh. Cozy.

382
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,380
是誰
Who's there?

383
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,350
是我  小傻瓜
It's just me, silly.

384
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,330
你還好嗎
Is everything all right?

385
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:08,080
你把我照顧得這么好
You've taken such good care of me,

386
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,150
我想是時候
I thought it was time for me

387
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:13,710
我來好好"照顧"你
to take good care of you.

388
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:16,830
沒這個必要
Oh, that's not necessary.

389
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,000
為什么
Why not?

390
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,700
我們可以扮醫生
We could play doctor.

391
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,910
你看醫生還沒看夠嗎
Haven't you seen enough doctors?

392
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:24,800
好吧  我們扮演帕特和瓦娜
Okay, we could play Pat and Vanna.

393
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:30,120
線索是  人們脫光了做的事
The clue is "Things people do naked."

394
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,610
納丁  別這樣
Okay, Nadine, just stop.

395
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,660
有什么不對
What's wrong?

396
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,270
我不會和你上床的
We're not gonna sleep together.

397
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,830
你是說
Are you saying

398
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:45,540
你不想要這個尤物嗎
that you don't want any of this?

399
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:53,890
不想  一百萬個不情愿
"N," And I'd like to buy five O's.

400
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,200
我們之間不來電
Look, we-we just don't click.

401
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,700
你居然這樣誤導我
I can't believe you led me on.

402
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,260
哪有  我是讓你進門  幫助你
Led you on? I let you in. I was trying to help you.

403
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:06,440
我看起來需要你的幫助嗎
Do I look like I need your help?

404
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:27,420
喂  我沒做什么
Yeah? No, I'm not doing anything.

405
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,630
不是吧
Seriously?

406
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,050
就是啊  我應該出個聲
I know, I know. I should say something.

407
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:31,360
不  算了
No, no, it's fine.

408
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,300
我看完電影后過去
I'll come over after the movie.

409
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,840
他現在就該走
He should go now.

410
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,450
你說什么
What's that?

411
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,990
無視他就行  你搭理他
Just ignore him. People can only make you angry

412
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,190
只會讓你生氣 
with your permission.

413
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:44,510
好  但如果他再開口  我就去找引座員
Right. But if he opens his mouth again, I will get the usher.

414
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:46,970
我的影評就是
I got my review.

415
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:49,680
#一部爛片
Hashtag piece of crap.

416
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:51,270
好吧  受夠了
All right, you know what? That's it.

417
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,790
慢著  別這樣  讓我來
Oh, wait, oh, no, no, no, Let me do this.

418
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:53,800
艾倫  你不用這么做 
Alan, Alan, you don't have to do this.

419
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,120
我是男人
Yes, I do. I'm the man

420
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,370
這是男人做的事  幫我拿著果膠軟糖
and this is what a man does. Now, hold my Jujubes.

421
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,550
-不好意思  先生  -什么事
- Uh, excuse me, sir? - What?

422
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:03,960
大家在看電影呢
Um, uh, we're all trying to watch the movie

423
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,160
我不知道你是否記得
and I don't know if you remember what the, uh,

424
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,500
卡通爆米花桶提醒過
the little cartoon popcorn bucket said,

425
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,420
沉默是金
but "Silence is golden."

426
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:13,080
是嗎  你想怎樣
Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do about it?

427
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,350
我已經做了
Uh, well, I just did it

428
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:17,150
但沒啥成效  所以...  
and it didn't seem very effective, so...

429
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:20,220
回去坐下吧
Go sit down.

430
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,900
知道嗎  不如你坐下吧
Okay, you know what? Why don't you sit down?

431
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,970
搞什么  搞什么
What the... What...

432
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,450
對不起
I'm sorry.

433
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:27,070
不用道歉
Don't apologize.

434
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:30,750
寶拉  我愛你
Paula? Hashtag I love you.

435
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,610
我還以為這段關系能夠有結果[去哪里]
I thought this relationship was going somewhere.

436
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:40,260
你說真的嗎  這段關系唯一去的地方
Okay, seriously? The only place this relationship is going

437
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,030
就是急診室
is the emergency room.

438
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,940
我以為咱們之間是特別的
I thought this was something special.

439
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:47,210
我以為我會成為納丁·霍爾施密特[馬屎]夫人
I thought I was going to be Mrs. Nadine Hore-Schmidt.

440
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,020
這也太瘋狂了
Okay, this is crazy.

441
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,130
如果你沒有從我家陽臺上掉下去
I mean, we wouldn't have gotten past the first date

442
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:54,830
我們第一次約會早不了了之了
if you hadn't fallen off my deck.

443
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,570
沒錯
That's right.

444
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,230
我的確從你家陽臺上掉下去了
I did fall off your deck.

445
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,840
我會向我的律師提到這點的
I'll be sure to mention that to my lawyer.

446
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,810
你的律師
Your lawyer?

447
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:02,920
沒錯
You heard me.

448
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,040
也許你在巴士車身上見過他的照片
Perhaps you've seen his picture on the side of the bus?

449
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,680
成為頂級意外事故律師
You don't get to be the numero uno accidente lawyer

450
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,460
可不是靠意外的
by accident.

451
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,200
走吧  弗蘭克
Come on, Frank.

452
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,090
你多保重  弗蘭克
Take care of yourself, Frank.

453
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,470
出什么事了
What's going on?

454
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:25,260
納丁準備告我  
Oh, Nadine is going to sue me

455
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,890
因為我不愿意和她上床 
because I won't sleep with her.

456
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:28,870
還有這種事啊
Oh, that's a thing?

457
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:30,500
別告訴艾倫
Don't tell Alan.

458
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,890
不可能吧
Oh, that can't be.

459
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,360
你好  納丁
Hi, Nadine.

460
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:49,180
我馬上過去
I'll be right there.

461
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:52,750
納丁被巴士撞了
Nadine got hit by a bus.

462
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:55,490
又要回到我和她的定情地了
Back to our special place.

463
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,750
你想看什么
What do you want to watch?

464
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:12,130
我知道有人想再看一遍《小豬寶貝》
I know someone wants to watch Babe again.
