00:00:06,036 --> 00:00:10,436

6
00:00:57,776 --> 00:01:01,736
你也换自行车骑了  安德伯雷医生
Aha. You've traded four wheels
for two, I see, Dr Enderbury.

7
00:01:01,756 --> 00:01:03,717
实际上...
Actually...

8
00:01:04,717 --> 00:01:06,777
“莫里斯”又拿修理厂修了
The Morris is at the garage again.

9
00:01:06,797 --> 00:01:08,798
简单但可靠  对吧
Reliable simplicity, hm?

10
00:01:09,798 --> 00:01:11,778
我觉得还是蛮有趣的
Quite enjoyable, I've found.

11
00:01:11,798 --> 00:01:14,719
- 你骑了很远吗  - 没有
- Have you had to cycle far? - No.

12
00:01:14,839 --> 00:01:16,819
我想差不多就九英里吧
Must be going on nine miles, I suppose.

13
00:01:16,839 --> 00:01:18,700
嗯~
Hm.

14
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,780
- 鲍威尔府邸  - 你好
- The Powell residence.  - Hello.

15
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,761
我是特拉斯科特夫人  我想找鲍威尔夫人
Please may I speak with Mrs Powell?It's Mrs Truscott.

16
00:01:30,781 --> 00:01:33,662
鲍威尔夫人刚刚出门了
Mrs Powell's just stepped out.

17
00:01:33,682 --> 00:01:35,762
你能帮忙转告她我打电话过来
Please be so kind as to inform Mrs Powell

18
00:01:35,782 --> 00:01:39,783
邀请她跟鲍威尔先生一起在周五共进晚餐吗
I telephoned to invite Mr and Mrs
Powell to dine here on Friday.

19
00:01:39,803 --> 00:01:42,844
行  我肯定会帮你传达到的  再见
Yes.I'll be sure to give her the message.Goodbye.

20
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:02,726
早上好  医生
Good morning, Doctor.

21
00:02:02,746 --> 00:02:05,847
我就是在会议前检查下器械而已
Just, you know, checking the
equipment before the meeting.

22
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:09,848
别告诉别人  好吗
Between us, eh?

23
00:02:16,748 --> 00:02:20,649
当安德伯雷医生提醒我菲尔菲克斯小姐心率不稳时
I'd removed the polyp and completed
the dilatation and curettage

24
00:02:20,669 --> 00:02:24,810
我正在移除鼻息肉  并进行扩张与刮除术
when Dr Enderbury alerted me that
Miss Fairfax's cardiac rhythm was erratic.

25
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,710
随即她就死亡了
She arrested moments after.

26
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:31,871
你估算过整个手术进行了多长时间吗
This procedure,Mr Powell,had lasted how long,do you estimate?

27
00:02:31,891 --> 00:02:33,832
二十分钟
20 minutes.

28
00:02:35,692 --> 00:02:37,362
你在暗示什么吗  教授
What are you suggesting, Professor?

29
00:02:37,562 --> 00:02:38,962
会不会是安德伯雷医生对时间掌握的失误呢
A simple error of timing by Dr Enderbury?

30
00:02:40,852 --> 00:02:42,852
人又孰能无过
We can all make mistakes.

31
00:02:43,773 --> 00:02:46,833
但是我依然非常信任查理・安德伯雷
Although I would gladly entrust
my life to Charlie Enderbury.

32
00:02:46,853 --> 00:02:48,834
他已经跟我共事了十五年
He's been my colleague for 15 years.

33
00:02:48,854 --> 00:02:53,715
手术失误尽管可以理解  但也是灾难性的
A procedural error - though
understandable,but catastrophic.

34
00:02:53,735 --> 00:02:55,475
要是有失误的话也都是我的
If there was any error, it was mine.

35
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:57,475
这不是我暗示你的意思
That is not what I am suggesting.

36
00:02:57,695 --> 00:02:59,776
我当然知道你在暗示什么
I know exactly what you're suggesting.

37
00:03:11,857 --> 00:03:15,698
莉莉  你来这儿有事吗
Lily? What are you doing here?

38
00:03:15,718 --> 00:03:17,718
没事儿
Oh, nothing.

39
00:03:17,738 --> 00:03:19,879
其实我是听说了菲尔菲克斯小姐的悲剧
Actually, it's this sad Miss Fairfax inquiry thingy.

40
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:23,679
但安德伯雷医生一向对这些事非常严谨的
Dr Enderbury takes these things very seriously.

41
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:25,720
这只是我的愚见
Well, that's what I see.

42
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,800
我一直觉得他是这一带最无畏的医生了
I expect he's the unflinching doctor
around this neck of the woods.

43
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:32,700
- 所以才导致他现在还依然膝下无子吗 - 天呐 不是的
- So no patter of tiny feet yet, then? - Gosh, no.

44
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,841
安德伯雷最不希望我挺个大肚子还整天哭哭啼啼
Last thing Dr Enderbury needs
is me moaning and swelling up and...

45
00:03:36,861 --> 00:03:38,821
那他最近如何
And how is he?

46
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,642
工作不努力吗
Not working too hard?

47
00:03:41,742 --> 00:03:43,742
你最清楚他们的为人了
You know what they're like.

48
00:03:43,762 --> 00:03:44,783
我是说跟鲍威尔一起做的工作
With Mr Powell, I mean.

49
00:03:45,823 --> 00:03:48,763
我想这件事我丈夫自有主张  护士长
Oh, my husband is very much his own man, Matron.

50
00:03:48,783 --> 00:03:51,684
他现在在会议室  你可去那儿找到他
You'll find him in the conference room.

51
00:03:55,845 --> 00:03:58,805
- 他们还冷静吗  - 说实话  一点也不
- Certainly took their time? - No, honestly.

52
00:03:58,825 --> 00:04:01,665
我们俩一起进去的几率很小
It's rare we get in the room together.

53
00:04:01,685 --> 00:04:02,845
莉莉
Lily.

54
00:04:02,865 --> 00:04:04,846
我有事正好经过这儿  就想着来看看你们
I was doing my errands and thought I'd pop in.

55
00:04:04,866 --> 00:04:07,286
对了  特拉斯科特夫妇想知道
Oh,and Mr and Mrs Truscott wondered

56
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,786
我们周五晚上有没有空一起吃个饭
if we were free for supper Friday evening.

57
00:04:08,806 --> 00:04:10,427
慢慢说不着急  莉莉
Well, one thing at a time, Lily.

58
00:04:10,527 --> 00:04:12,727
莉莉  你今天早上看起来非常动人
Lily, you look enchanting this morning.

59
00:04:12,747 --> 00:04:14,768
你觉得呢  查理
Don't you think, Charlie?

60
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:16,708
说真的  你真不该过来的
Really, you shouldn't have come.

61
00:04:16,808 --> 00:04:18,708
不  你说得对
No. You are right.

62
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:29,670
我只想告诉你我有多爱你
I wanted you to know just how much I love you.

63
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,710
安德伯雷医生
Dr Enderbury?

64
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,831
你不介意的话请进来吧
If you don't mind.

65
00:04:46,733 --> 00:04:50,714
在这场悲剧之后  我检查了器械
And, naturally,after the tragedy,
I checked both the equipment...

66
00:04:50,734 --> 00:04:52,673
还反思了整个手术过程
and our procedures.

67
00:04:54,874 --> 00:04:57,734
而且你今天早上又检查过一遍器械对吗
And again this morning you checked the equipment?

68
00:04:57,754 --> 00:04:59,754
一只小鸟告诉我的  你没检查过吗
A little birdy told me. No?

69
00:05:00,715 --> 00:05:03,795
要是我们排除技术故障的话
So, if we rule out a technical malfunction,

70
00:05:03,815 --> 00:05:07,836
就只有鲍威尔先生所说的人为失误这个可能了
we are left with,as Mr Powell
suggested, a human error.

71
00:05:09,836 --> 00:05:12,877
也可能是病人肺部血栓  也可能是其他自然因素
Or a pulmonary embolism or some other natural cause

72
00:05:13,877 --> 00:05:15,838
你现在有过度焦虑吗
Were you under any undue anxiety?

73
00:05:17,838 --> 00:05:18,857
梅塔
Mehta?

74
00:05:18,877 --> 00:05:21,478
有传言说安德伯雷医生协助
Rumour has it that Dr Enderbury had been

75
00:05:21,498 --> 00:05:23,778
鲍威尔医生接收了一名私诊病人
assisting Mr Powell with a private patient.

76
00:05:23,798 --> 00:05:24,838
没有
No.

77
00:05:26,779 --> 00:05:29,859
这刚好发生在菲尔菲克斯小姐去世的前一天晚上
The very night before the unfortunate Miss Fairfax passed away.

78
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:34,760
而且沃斯伯护士长也告诉过我警察也提及过...
And Matron Vosper tells me that the police had mentioned -

79
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:38,221
那个啊  对  确实是有个急诊
Oh, that. Yes. The emergency admission.

80
00:05:39,761 --> 00:05:41,802
但没在这间医院
It wasn't here, though.

81
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,862
- 那在哪儿  - 一栋居民楼中
- So where? - At a house.

82
00:05:44,882 --> 00:05:46,882
但是从未有什么事发生
Uh, but nothing happened.

83
00:05:49,702 --> 00:05:51,463
我能问你到底什么样的私人手术
Can I ask what private procedure required an

84
00:05:51,483 --> 00:05:54,763
需要在私人住所进行  而且还需要麻醉师随同吗
anaesthetist at night, at a private residence?

85
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,850
我从未见过你这般的尤物
I have never seen anything as beautiful.

86
00:06:52,693 --> 00:06:55,733
我从未要求过你进入我的生活  我有吗  鲍威尔夫人
I didn't ask you into my life,did I,Mrs Powell?

87
00:06:56,814 --> 00:06:58,854
我从没想过...
I never expected...

88
00:07:03,695 --> 00:07:04,915
- 但那些事...  - 不行
- But things... - No.

89
00:07:04,935 --> 00:07:06,755
检察长
Inspector.

90
00:07:09,855 --> 00:07:11,776
不能在这儿做
Not like this.

91
00:07:14,736 --> 00:07:16,757
我会通知你时间地点的
I will tell you when and where.

92
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:18,897
现在  请你先下车
Now get out of the car.

93
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:36,720
- 对了  - 什么事  修女
- Right... - Yes, Sister?

94
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,780
我有个工作交给你
I have a job for you.

95
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,800
黎明就出发
Leaving at dawn.

96
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:44,721
鲍威尔先生需要一个护士跟他去多塞特
Mr Powell needs a nurse to assist
him with a multiple delivery,

97
00:07:44,741 --> 00:07:47,842
进行一个多胎孕妇分娩手术  他专门让我来问问你
in Dorset, and he asked for you specifically.

98
00:07:48,942 --> 00:07:51,303
要我是你的话  我会忘记我刚才说的话
If I was you, I'd forget I ever even told

99
00:07:51,323 --> 00:07:53,803
直接回家好好睡上一觉
you and go home and get a good night's sleep.

100
00:07:53,823 --> 00:07:55,803
- 听懂了吗  - 懂了
- You hear me? - I do.

101
00:07:55,823 --> 00:07:58,644
- 然后呢  - 我会忘记你刚才说的话
- And? - I've forgotten you ever told me.

102
00:07:58,703 --> 00:07:59,823
嗯~嗯~
Mm-hm.

103
00:08:26,867 --> 00:08:29,808
伊丽莎白  黑灯瞎火的坐这儿干嘛呢
Elizabeth. What are you doing sitting in the dark?

104
00:08:29,948 --> 00:08:32,889
我想可能是刚才想事情入迷了  不知不觉太阳就落山了
I...suppose I was lost in thought and the sun set.

105
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:34,829
今天忙吗
Busy day?

106
00:08:35,829 --> 00:08:37,249
J太太给你留了些东西
Mrs J left you something.

107
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:42,951
- 晚安  奥托  - 我早上要出发去看诊
- Good night, Otto. - I'm off in the morning.

108
00:08:43,911 --> 00:08:45,911
今晚我就得出门
I'll be away for the night.

109
00:08:58,433 --> 00:09:00,433
就停在这儿行了  零就不用找了
Just here, please. Keep the change.

110
00:09:11,495 --> 00:09:13,416
早安
Morning.

111
00:09:33,619 --> 00:09:35,519
你想干什么  瑞奇
What do you want, Richie?

112
00:09:35,539 --> 00:09:38,420
对我来说现在可还是半夜呢
It's the middle of the night for me.

113
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,560
你看起来过得不好啊  亲爱的
You look rough, darling.

114
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,500
我昨晚整晚都没睡
I've been up all night.

115
00:09:44,481 --> 00:09:46,440
是因为一个急诊
It was an emergency.

116
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,581
给一个病入膏肓的病人治疗
Treating a patient that was desperately ill.

117
00:09:50,581 --> 00:09:53,562
那却让我想你了
It made me want you.

118
00:09:53,582 --> 00:09:55,582
天呐  真浪漫呢
Christ, how romantic.

119
00:09:57,542 --> 00:09:58,663
但是我意识到我是爱你的
But I realise I love you.

120
00:10:00,543 --> 00:10:02,663
你不必爱我的
You don't have to love me, you know.

121
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:07,524
我发誓我真的爱你
I swear I do.

122
00:10:07,544 --> 00:10:09,445
听着...
Look...

123
00:10:09,465 --> 00:10:10,605
听我说
Listen.

124
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:14,665
这里发生的任何事都与爱情无关  好吗
What happens here has got nothing
to do with love.All right?

125
00:10:16,585 --> 00:10:19,626
你把你的爱都留给你那美丽动人的简吧  瑞奇
You save that love for your beautiful Jean, Richie.

126
00:10:24,507 --> 00:10:26,507
在这儿发生的...
What happens here...

127
00:10:29,508 --> 00:10:31,508
一切都只是为了取乐而已
...is simply to do with pleasure.

128
00:10:34,469 --> 00:10:36,469
你懂吗
Do you understand?

129
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:49,611
鲍威尔先生  早上好  先生
Mr Powell. Good morning, sir.

130
00:10:49,631 --> 00:10:52,031
有传言说你要去多塞特为
Rumour is you're off to Dorset for a

131
00:10:52,061 --> 00:10:53,631
一名有先兆子痫多胞胎孕妇进行分娩手术
multiple delivery with pre-eclampsia.

132
00:10:53,651 --> 00:10:55,212
要是我能亲眼见证您的工作的话  我情愿
I would give my left leg to witness you

133
00:10:55,232 --> 00:10:57,612
把我的左腿都奉献给你  要是我能帮上忙的话...
at work and if I could be of any use...

134
00:10:57,632 --> 00:10:59,633
抱歉  总有一天我会成为科恩医生
Sorry. One day I will be Dr Cohen but

135
00:10:59,703 --> 00:11:01,633
但现在叫我山姆也无所谓
right now I'm more comfortable with Sam.

136
00:11:02,593 --> 00:11:05,493
山姆  我恐怕我真的要...
Sam. I'm afraid I really uh...

137
00:11:09,554 --> 00:11:12,474
我实在是想不出有什么理由不带你去
I actually cannot think of an excuse not to take you.

138
00:11:12,674 --> 00:11:15,475
- 我一定会成为你的左膀右臂的  - 好吧
- I will be indispensible. - Right.

139
00:11:20,676 --> 00:11:23,676
- 我本来可以做更好的决定的  - 你好  护士
- Rather against my better judgment...- Hello,Nurse

140
00:11:24,437 --> 00:11:25,657
我叫科恩
Cohen.

141
00:11:25,677 --> 00:11:28,477
- 但我...  - 你要是叫他山姆的话他会更乐意的
- But I am - He is more comfortable as Sam

142
00:11:28,497 --> 00:11:30,578
而且他现在可是我的得力助手
and he is indispensible, Nurse Wilson.

143
00:11:30,598 --> 00:11:32,537
是吗  鲍威尔先生
Is he, Mr Powell?

144
00:11:32,557 --> 00:11:35,438
希望我没有打扰到你们
Well,I certainly hope I'm not the gooseberry.

145
00:11:42,659 --> 00:11:45,560
鲍威尔夫人  我没迟到吧
Mrs Powell? I'm not late?

146
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,841
当然没有  但我们现在得说话小点声
Heavens,no!But do let's keep our voices down.

147
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:49,641
托马斯还在睡着呢
Thomas is still asleep.

148
00:11:49,661 --> 00:11:51,581
鲍威尔先生昨晚也因为
Mr Powell announced late last night

149
00:11:51,601 --> 00:11:53,581
一项仁慈的任务很晚才回来
he'd been summoned on a mercy mission,

150
00:11:53,601 --> 00:11:55,471
所以我觉得现在也许是把托马斯
so I thought this might be a good few

151
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:58,581
介绍给你父母的最好时机
days to introduce him to your parents.

152
00:11:58,601 --> 00:12:01,462
去塞尔西小小地渡个假
In Selsey. A little holiday.

153
00:12:01,482 --> 00:12:03,622
我们...现在是在说期中假的事儿吗
We uh...talked about half term.

154
00:12:03,642 --> 00:12:05,223
你不觉得他那个不太好的胸腔
The sea air will clear that nasty chest

155
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:08,523
呼吸点海边的空气会更好点吗
he seems to have acquired, don't you think?

156
00:12:08,543 --> 00:12:11,564
- 但他还要上课  - 我会跟学校那边说的
- But he has school.- I'll telephone the secretary

157
00:12:12,664 --> 00:12:14,485
现在有辆去维多利亚的大巴
There's a coach up to Victoria and

158
00:12:14,505 --> 00:12:16,685
跟一辆去奇切斯特的火车
then, I imagine, a train up to Chichester.

159
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,445
你可以给我带些石头回来做纪念
You could bring me back some rock.

160
00:12:23,586 --> 00:12:25,686
特拉斯科特  你有看到奥托在哪儿吗  老兄
Truscott, have you seen Otto anywhere, old man?

161
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:29,546
鲍威尔先生啊  据我所知  现在在多塞特呢
Mr Powell, I understand, is in Dorset.

162
00:12:29,566 --> 00:12:31,587
帮一个有并发症的多胞胎孕妇接生
A multiple births with complications.

163
00:12:31,607 --> 00:12:34,587
好吧  我忘了这茬了
Ah, that's right.Completely slipped my mind.

164
00:12:35,568 --> 00:12:37,468
现在没人可以帮你了  查理
No-one to hold your hand, Charlie?

165
00:12:37,488 --> 00:12:39,548
国王已死  国王万岁
The King is dead! Long live the King!

166
00:12:43,489 --> 00:12:46,490
你不能让亨明斯跟一个神志不清的女孩
You can't leave Hemmings alone with an unconscious girl

167
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,470
在没人看管情况下单独待一起  吉妮
without there being a... Jeannie!

168
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:50,611
你在这儿呢  还真是无处不在啊
Here you are. Been everywhere.

169
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,670
我想告诉你我们周五晚上有安排了
I wanted to tell you we've having the Friday evening do.

170
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,631
你先去吧
Ah, there's a good chap.

171
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:56,611
你在这儿来干什么呢
Look, what are you doing here?

172
00:12:56,621 --> 00:12:59,511
来看看你为什么没有回家
Seeing as you didn't come home...

173
00:12:59,531 --> 00:13:01,532
我们一晚上都在忙呢
We were rushed off our feet all night.

174
00:13:01,552 --> 00:13:04,552
我觉得还是亲自来告诉你更好
...I thought it'd be better if I came
here to tell you myself.

175
00:13:04,572 --> 00:13:07,693
我已经邀请了泰姬陵夫妇
I've invited Dr and Mrs Taj Mahal...

176
00:13:09,493 --> 00:13:11,594
鲍威尔夫妇  以及查理和莉莉
..the Powells...Charlie and Lily.

177
00:13:12,534 --> 00:13:14,694
我可以做得来  我可以
I can do it. I can.

178
00:13:16,655 --> 00:13:18,554
还有你父母亲
And your mother and father.

179
00:13:18,574 --> 00:13:21,435
但是  吉妮  你不会做饭  而且我母亲...
But, Jeannie, you can't cook and my mother -

180
00:13:21,455 --> 00:13:23,795
莉莉答应帮忙的  好吧  不仅仅是帮忙
Lily's promised to help. Well, more  than help.

181
00:13:23,805 --> 00:13:25,595
但这不是重点  好吗
But that's not the point, is it?

182
00:13:27,496 --> 00:13:29,556
你不是一直想这样吗
I thought this was what you wanted.

183
00:13:30,616 --> 00:13:33,557
管他呢  所有人都很乐意来做客
Anyway, everyone said they'd be delighted.

184
00:13:33,577 --> 00:13:36,498
晚上八点  别迟到了
Eight. Don't be late.

185
00:13:58,501 --> 00:14:00,581
- 你睡着了  - 夜晚真短啊
- You slept. - Short night.

186
00:14:02,582 --> 00:14:04,542
立正
Atten-tion.

187
00:14:05,002 --> 00:14:07,523
你好  我是杰克逊  你一定就是鲍威尔了
Hello. Jackson. You must be Powell.

188
00:14:07,543 --> 00:14:09,603
我们已经给你在护士房里整理了一张床
We've cleared you a bed at the nurses' cottage.

189
00:14:09,623 --> 00:14:11,523
我们是同一个团队的  修女  而且很时髦的
We're a team, Sister. Very modern.

190
00:14:11,543 --> 00:14:14,443
我们已经在公牛头宾馆订好了三间房
And we have booked three rooms at the Bull's Head

191
00:14:14,463 --> 00:14:17,644
- 我们能先见见我们的病人吗  - 您先请
- Shall we visit our patient? - Ah. After you.

192
00:14:20,664 --> 00:14:24,545
哦~  你看起来真像是最英勇的士兵
Oh,don't you look every bit the brave soldier!

193
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:29,486
你会过得非常愉快的  不是吗
You'll have a marvellous time,won't you?

194
00:14:29,506 --> 00:14:31,527
难道他不会吗
Won't he?

195
00:14:34,687 --> 00:14:37,567
出租车来了
That'll be the taxi.

196
00:14:39,547 --> 00:14:43,348
好了  托马斯  我希望你能特别留意
Now,Thomas dear.I want you to take particular

197
00:14:43,668 --> 00:14:45,608
J太太  别把她在火车上
care of Mrs J and not leave her on the train

198
00:14:45,628 --> 00:14:47,629
或是在维多利亚给弄丢了
or lose her at Victoria.

199
00:14:49,609 --> 00:14:52,610
- 好了  快走吧  - 走吧
- For heaven's sake, go. - Come on.

200
00:15:00,551 --> 00:15:02,552
拜  宝贝
Bye, darling.

201
00:15:03,592 --> 00:15:04,711
拜
Bye.

202
00:15:30,615 --> 00:15:34,476
先天性惊厥血毒症  鲍威尔先生  以及三个似胎心脏
Pre-eclamptic toxaemia,Mr Powell,and three foetal hearts.

203
00:15:34,676 --> 00:15:36,676
谢谢  杰克逊医生
Thank you, Dr Jackson.

204
00:15:39,637 --> 00:15:41,637
是执事小姐  先生
Miss Deacon, sir.

205
00:15:41,657 --> 00:15:43,638
呃...
Uh...

206
00:15:44,558 --> 00:15:46,538
早上好  小姐
Good morning, young lady.

207
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:52,500
夫人
Madam.

208
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:57,580
我是收养机构的 鲍威尔先生 我还是待在屋里的好
Adoption services,Mr Powell,and I
would rather stay in the room,sir.

209
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,560
要是您不要要的话就请便吧  夫人  好了 小姐
If you must, madam.Now,Miss.

210
00:16:08,562 --> 00:16:10,642
请接通穆里根检察长
Yes.Chief Inspector Mulligan,please.

211
00:16:11,622 --> 00:16:13,663
我是穆里根检察长
Chief Inspector Mulligan speaking.

212
00:16:13,683 --> 00:16:17,623
喂  检察长  你可以晚上八点来我家
Hello,Inspector.You can come
to the house at eight o'clock.

213
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,624
请带上陈词跟照片
And bring the statements and the photographs,please.

214
00:16:20,644 --> 00:16:21,704
我会准时到的
I'll be there.

215
00:16:55,689 --> 00:16:57,589
你要喝点什么吗  先生
What's your poison, sir?

216
00:16:57,609 --> 00:16:59,630
- 苹果汁  - 呃...
- Apple juice. - Ah.

217
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:02,550
- 你呢  威尔森护士  - 杜松子酒跟奎宁水
- Nurse Wilson? - Gin and tonic.

218
00:17:05,611 --> 00:17:08,472
- 你不必说出口  - 我觉得我有必要说
- You don't need to say it. - Oh,I think I do.

219
00:17:08,492 --> 00:17:09,672
我们开了六个小时的车
Have we really driven for six hours

220
00:17:09,692 --> 00:17:10,213
到这里来就是为了让这些婴儿
to deliver babies that are going to  be taken

221
00:17:10,233 --> 00:17:13,513
一出娘胎就被迫与母亲分离吗
from their mother the moment open the womb?

222
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:16,513
不  我们开车六个小时来是为了确保
No. We've driven for six hours

223
00:17:16,533 --> 00:17:19,733
执事小姐的孩子不受到任何伤害地出生
to ensure that neither Miss Deacon
or her babies come to any harm.

224
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:23,734
当然很显然不只是这样
And it isn't just that.

225
00:17:24,614 --> 00:17:26,514
干嘛
What?

226
00:17:26,534 --> 00:17:28,595
为什么我要让你来
Why I asked you.

227
00:17:29,675 --> 00:17:32,735
我恐怕越过了最黑暗的地方  鲍威尔先生
I've gone over to the dark side,I'm afraid,Mr Powell.

228
00:17:33,495 --> 00:17:35,596
这个社工可能是纳粹秘密警察
That social worker might have been the Gestapo.

229
00:17:35,616 --> 00:17:37,536
我们是医学工作者
We are medics.

230
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,017
但这并不意味着我们就不能阻止坏事的发生
It doesn't mean we can't stop terrible things happening.

231
00:17:40,037 --> 00:17:43,636
不  但这意味着我们的判断必须在我们的能力范围之内
No,but it does mean that our judgments
are based on things we can influence,

232
00:17:43,656 --> 00:17:46,517
而不是我们所希望或是所感觉到的而已
rather than things we might hope or feel.

233
00:17:46,717 --> 00:17:48,677
这真是...
That is so...

234
00:17:48,697 --> 00:17:50,738
干杯  不管怎样
Cheers...anyway,

235
00:17:51,498 --> 00:17:56,519
非常感谢你先生  能让我加入你们这个
and thank you, sir, for allowing me to join
you on what has become a nightmare story

236
00:17:56,539 --> 00:17:58,639
婴儿从生母怀里被抢夺的恐怖故事里面来
of babies being ripped from their mother's bosom.

237
00:17:58,659 --> 00:17:59,580
敬已成定局的事
To moral certainty.

238
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,680
他不是那个意思  对吧  山姆
He didn't mean that. Did you, Sam?

239
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,680
对  不是那个意思
Yes and no.

240
00:18:04,621 --> 00:18:07,721
不管怎样  我的头现在要被应承专业自杀
However, at this moment I am torn
between committing professional suicide

241
00:18:07,741 --> 00:18:09,742
跟去厕所这两件事快给撕成两半了
or going to the toilet.

242
00:18:13,521 --> 00:18:16,502
我没打算带个陪护过来的
I didn't actually intend to bring a chaperone.

243
00:18:16,522 --> 00:18:19,643
- 他确实让人难以拒绝  - 如果你喜欢小家伙的话
- He's sort of irresistible. - If you like puppies.

244
00:18:19,663 --> 00:18:21,583
他们自由所属
They have their place.

245
00:18:24,564 --> 00:18:27,544
我现在累坏了  我得去躺会儿了
But I am exhausted...and off to bed.

246
00:18:27,704 --> 00:18:29,725
- 早点睡  - 威尔森护士
- Early night. - Nurse Wilson...

247
00:18:29,745 --> 00:18:31,705
有事吗  鲍威尔先生
Yes, Mr Powell?

248
00:18:33,665 --> 00:18:35,666
祝你睡个好觉
Sleep well.

249
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:44,487
我刚刚说了什么吗  我觉得我刚刚一直在
What did I say?I thought I was walking the line

250
00:18:44,507 --> 00:18:47,487
敏感跟有魅力两者之间游刃有余啊
between "charm" and "sensitive" effortlessly.

251
00:18:47,507 --> 00:18:48,627
不是你的缘故
It's not you.

252
00:18:48,647 --> 00:18:50,548
她只是累了
She's tired.

253
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:53,169
要是你问我她怎么样的话
Well, she is absolute bloody dynamite,

254
00:18:53,229 --> 00:18:54,629
她肯定是个极为优秀的人
if you ask me,Mr Powell.

255
00:18:55,589 --> 00:18:56,769
我或许不该带她过来的
I probably shouldn't have brought her.

256
00:18:56,789 --> 00:18:57,689
我不清楚啦  先生
Oh, I don't know.Sir.

257
00:18:57,709 --> 00:18:59,110
你不喝酒吗  还是说只是今晚不喝
Don't drink?Or just not tonight?

258
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:00,710
要是您不介意我这么问的话
If you don't mind me asking.

259
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:03,709
好奇的脑袋知道什么该问什么不该问的  科恩
An enquiring mind should know its limits, Cohen.

260
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,710
要是我问的太多的话  我向你道歉  先生
Sorry, sir, if I'm too forward.

261
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:11,651
我之所以不喝酒  是因为在酒精作用下
I don't drink because I once,under the influence,

262
00:19:11,671 --> 00:19:13,731
可能会导致我犯非常严重的错误
made a terrible mistake.

263
00:19:16,752 --> 00:19:20,533
- 干杯  - 干杯
- Cheers. - Cheers.

264
00:19:49,517 --> 00:19:51,558
查理
Charlie.

265
00:19:51,718 --> 00:19:54,638
伊丽莎白  抱歉  我本来想给你打电话来着  但...
Elizabeth.I'm sorry.I was going to telephone but...

266
00:19:55,699 --> 00:19:57,698
呃...奥托不在家
Uh... Otto's not here.

267
00:19:57,718 --> 00:19:59,758
这个我知道  这就是我为什么...
No, I know. That's why I...

268
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:03,619
我能进来吗
Can I come in?

269
00:20:16,622 --> 00:20:16,962
想喝点什么吗  查理
Can I get you something, Charlie?

270
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:19,762
不  不用了  谢谢  我...
No. No, thank you. I...

271
00:20:24,722 --> 00:20:26,663
一切都还好吗  伊丽莎白
Is everything all right, Elizabeth?

272
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:30,624
当然  我只是很惊讶而已  我没想到现在会有人造访
Yes.I...just was surprised.I wasn't expecting anyone.

273
00:20:31,644 --> 00:20:32,764
汤米呢
Where's Tommy?

274
00:20:34,684 --> 00:20:37,625
J太太想回去探望她的母亲
Um... Mrs J wanted to see her mother.

275
00:20:37,645 --> 00:20:40,585
而托马斯胸腔不是很好  所以他们现在去了塞尔西
He had a nasty chest, so they're in Selsey.

276
00:20:40,605 --> 00:20:43,666
他们可能要旅行几天才能回
They thought they'd make a trip of it for a few days.

277
00:20:43,686 --> 00:20:46,507
所以我现在才一个人在家
And so I'm here...alone,

278
00:20:46,527 --> 00:20:47,727
奥托接生小孩去了
Otto delivering babies.

279
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,746
对
Yes.

280
00:20:51,727 --> 00:20:52,887
你能给我来呗威士忌苏打...
You know, a whisky soda would...

281
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,707
马上就来
Coming right up.

282
00:21:25,592 --> 00:21:28,753
事实上  我正是想跟你谈谈奥托来着
Actually, it was in fact Otto I wanted to talk to you about.

283
00:21:30,693 --> 00:21:32,674
干杯
Chin-chin.

284
00:21:45,655 --> 00:21:48,576
你知道的...嗯...
You see...um...

285
00:21:50,536 --> 00:21:52,577
我现在来访可能有点冒犯了
...I could be in a touch of bother.

286
00:21:52,597 --> 00:21:55,677
你知道的  我现在很担心  而且我现在非常依赖奥托
Oh,you know,I do worry and I do absolutely rely on Otto.

287
00:21:58,658 --> 00:22:00,718
你真的还好吗  伊丽莎白
Are you sure you're all right,Elizabeth?

288
00:22:00,738 --> 00:22:02,759
你这话什么意思
Whatever do you mean?

289
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:06,619
你看起来...有点心不在焉
You seem... Well, distracted.

290
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,579
天呐  哪有的事
Good heavens, no.

291
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,261
要不是奥托对我的“恩惠”
I wouldn't be in this mess

292
00:22:17,301 --> 00:22:20,661
我现在也不会落得如此下场
if it wasn't for Otto and his specials.

293
00:22:24,662 --> 00:22:26,602
你知道吗  亲爱的伊丽莎白
And do you know, dear Elizabeth,

294
00:22:26,622 --> 00:22:28,723
要是一个警察突然来到这里的话
if a police inspector was to walk in here right now,

295
00:22:28,743 --> 00:22:29,764
我真不知道我会不会
I'm not sure I wouldn't just put

296
00:22:29,864 --> 00:22:32,664
举起双手说道：“我有罪 清逮捕我吧”
my hands up and say "guilty as charged".

297
00:22:34,584 --> 00:22:38,764
我真非常害怕终有一天他会弃我于不顾
I'm afraid that one day he is going
to leave me hanging in the wind.

298
00:22:38,784 --> 00:22:42,625
- 奥托视你为兄长   - 我可不这么想
- Otto cares for you like a brother. - I don't think so.

299
00:22:44,545 --> 00:22:47,586
我不认为奥托除了自己之外还会关心任何人
I don't think Otto cares for anyone but himself.

300
00:22:47,746 --> 00:22:48,927
查理  你这样说真是太过分了
Charlie,that's a terrible thing to say.

301
00:22:48,937 --> 00:22:52,587
我能感觉到现在命悬一线
I can feel the noose tightening.

302
00:22:55,787 --> 00:22:58,568
奥托应该知道  要是他不仁
Otto should know, from me...

303
00:22:59,588 --> 00:23:01,068
我也会不义  我绝不会对发生在塞浦路斯
I will not keep silent about what happened

304
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:04,648
关于你们俩的事只字不提
in Cyprus about him and you.

305
00:23:04,668 --> 00:23:07,569
我会一直身怀歉意  伊丽莎白
I'm sorry, Elizabeth, for ever.

306
00:23:07,589 --> 00:23:09,529
- 要是我...  - 查理
- If...I - Charlie.

307
00:23:09,549 --> 00:23:11,669
我们骗了他
We lied for him.

308
00:23:11,689 --> 00:23:16,630
我双手沾满过鲜血  而且我依然在撒谎  你也一样
I had blood on my hands and I am lying still.You are too.

309
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,671
查理
Charlie...

310
00:23:18,691 --> 00:23:21,631
不管是你还是我  奥托都不会让我们失望的
Otto will never let you down, or me.

311
00:23:21,731 --> 00:23:23,732
我知道他不会的
I know that.

312
00:23:24,752 --> 00:23:27,713
而且你对我们而言  是一位非常特别的朋友
Besides, you are a very special friend.

313
00:23:35,553 --> 00:23:36,713
对
Yes.

314
00:23:39,714 --> 00:23:42,734
有没有可能一个可怜的女人因自然因素死亡呢
Could be that...poor woman died of natural causes.

315
00:23:44,595 --> 00:23:46,615
而非失误
No fault.

316
00:23:47,595 --> 00:23:49,556
可能是吧
Could be.

317
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,701
安德伯雷要是刚才来这儿干嘛呢
What was Dr Enderbury doing here just now?

318
00:24:20,581 --> 00:24:21,761
他没通知一声就过来了  检察长
He arrived unannounced, Inspector.

319
00:24:21,781 --> 00:24:24,641
别  伊丽莎白
Please, Elizabeth...

320
00:24:25,601 --> 00:24:26,741
你没必要跟我撒谎
...there is no reason to lie to me.

321
00:24:26,761 --> 00:24:28,722
我没有
I'm not.

322
00:24:29,662 --> 00:24:32,802
你现在能给我你掌握的陈词跟照片吗
Now, would you please give me the
statements and the photographs you have?

323
00:24:35,643 --> 00:24:37,763
你是如此绝世倾城
You are so beautiful.

324
00:24:45,565 --> 00:24:47,725
我可是花重金才买到的
I asked for the best money could buy.

325
00:24:49,605 --> 00:24:50,745
那个年轻的售货员还笑着说
Young lady laughed and said,

326
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:52,645
“这肯定是送给一位非常特别之人”
"It must be for someone very special."

327
00:24:52,665 --> 00:24:55,766
- 我要你的陈词  - 当然
- I need the statements. - Of course.

328
00:24:56,806 --> 00:24:59,667
我不想伤害你
I don't want to hurt you.

329
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:30,712
- 你最好现在离开这儿  检察长  - 请叫我罗纳尔德
- You'd better go, Inspector. - Ronald. Please.

330
00:25:33,392 --> 00:25:36,653
你的倩影在我的脑海里挥之不去
You've been in my head...

331
00:25:38,293 --> 00:25:40,754
让我为之疯狂
..driving me wild...

332
00:25:41,394 --> 00:25:44,334
彻夜难眠  脑子里想的全是你
I've not slept, thinking about you.

333
00:25:44,354 --> 00:25:46,294
想着我们在一起的样子
Imagining us together.

334
00:25:46,314 --> 00:25:48,814
但是后来...
But then to...

335
00:25:49,435 --> 00:25:51,655
我们完得如此之快
..so quickly.

336
00:25:52,615 --> 00:25:55,696
- 对不起  - 别再说了
- I'm sorry. - Please...

337
00:25:58,616 --> 00:26:02,737
我已经给了你想要的  现在快给我陈词跟照片
I've done what you wanted, now just give
me the statements and the photographs.

338
00:26:06,738 --> 00:26:08,817
那我成了什么
What have I become?

339
00:26:13,619 --> 00:26:16,619
我的一部分...
There's a part of me...

340
00:26:16,779 --> 00:26:19,660
我的一部分消失不见了
There's a...part of me that's missing.

341
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:24,001
我的儿子死了  而且...
My son died and...

342
00:26:24,221 --> 00:26:25,641
我一直在寻找
I've been looking,

343
00:26:25,661 --> 00:26:28,801
寻找能填补这份空缺的东西
searching to fill that part...

344
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:32,622
但绝不是这样的
..not like this.

345
00:26:42,663 --> 00:26:44,583
不
No...

346
00:26:44,704 --> 00:26:46,744
我要的不是这样
Not like this.

347
00:26:48,784 --> 00:26:51,685
没事了  罗纳尔德
It's all right...Ronald.

348
00:26:53,605 --> 00:26:54,826
你只需要给我你掌握的东西
Just give me what you have...And...

349
00:26:55,586 --> 00:26:56,806
我没有带来
I didn't bring them.

350
00:27:00,347 --> 00:27:03,386
我以为你只是在戏弄我而已
I was convinced you were trying to trick me.

351
00:27:04,747 --> 00:27:06,707
对不起
I'm sorry.

352
00:27:30,491 --> 00:27:33,691
天呐  哦~  天呐
Oh, God! Oh, God!

353
00:28:24,699 --> 00:28:26,760
- 妈咪  - 宝贝
- Mummy! - Darling.

354
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,661
我一直在求J太太早点带我回来  因为我不在他身边
I absolutely begged Mrs J to come
back early because I left him.

355
00:28:34,721 --> 00:28:38,822
我想他肯定也想你想他一样想你
Well, I suspect he missed you
just as much as you missed him.

356
00:28:40,763 --> 00:28:42,743
这个孩子看起来真像我爸爸
This one looks just like my da.

357
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:44,723
他很强壮
He's strong.

358
00:28:46,644 --> 00:28:48,663
就跟我爸爸一样
Like my da.

359
00:28:49,723 --> 00:28:51,704
啊  你来了
Ah, there you are.

360
00:28:51,724 --> 00:28:53,844
我刚准备去找你呢  我们能出去谈谈吗
I was just on my way. Shall we?

361
00:28:59,725 --> 00:29:02,706
我们很幸运看到爱丽斯还活着 还有三个健康的孩子
We're lucky that Alice is alive
and has three healthy babies.

362
00:29:02,726 --> 00:29:05,707
我们跟你们伦敦人不一样  医生
We are not like you people from London,Doctor.

363
00:29:05,727 --> 00:29:07,767
一个未婚先孕的孩子只会是一种情况
A child conceived out of wedlock is one thing.

364
00:29:08,687 --> 00:29:10,808
她的父亲强奸了她
Her father forced himself on her.

365
00:29:10,828 --> 00:29:12,788
他是这三个孩子的父亲
He is the father of those children.

366
00:29:12,808 --> 00:29:15,648
而且执事小姐还是个未成年人
And Miss Deacon is a minor.

367
00:29:17,688 --> 00:29:18,788
是的  鲍威尔先生
Yes, Mr Powell.

368
00:29:18,808 --> 00:29:22,749
当她求助于我们时  我们会照顾他们跟爱丽斯
We will care for them and Alice when she turns to us.

369
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:26,730
非常感谢你为她所做的事
Thank you for what you've done.

370
00:29:54,854 --> 00:29:57,715
看着这些婴儿被移送...
Seeing those babies being delivered...

371
00:29:57,735 --> 00:29:59,775
你帮助爱丽斯的这种方式
the way you helped Alice...

372
00:30:01,756 --> 00:30:03,776
让我感觉到从未有过的这般有活力
I don't think I've ever felt more alive...

373
00:30:04,756 --> 00:30:06,637
这般开心
..or happier.

374
00:30:06,657 --> 00:30:08,716
然后被告知他们...
And then to be told they were...

375
00:30:10,696 --> 00:30:13,737
你有没有觉得生活总是爱跟你开玩笑
Do you think life is always like this
- playing tricks on you?

376
00:30:15,737 --> 00:30:17,738
我觉得...
I think...

377
00:30:19,638 --> 00:30:21,679
说真的吗
Truthfully?

378
00:30:21,699 --> 00:30:23,739
我觉得只有今天
I think there's only ever today.

379
00:30:25,659 --> 00:30:26,860
现在这一刻
Now.

380
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,721
我希望
I wish...

381
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,721
?给自己行个方便
?Do yourself a favour

382
00:30:36,741 --> 00:30:38,661
?来段混音
?Have a Medley

383
00:30:38,681 --> 00:30:40,701
我希望这算得上医学级
Medical grade, I'm hoping.

384
00:30:51,824 --> 00:30:55,644
缺氧所有这些东西的根本路径
Lack of oxygen is,of course,the route of all this.

385
00:30:55,664 --> 00:30:56,785
如果病人...
If a patient...

386
00:30:57,665 --> 00:30:59,685
安德伯雷医生  好消息
Ah, Dr Enderbury, good news.

387
00:30:59,705 --> 00:31:02,725
自然原因致死  就跟我们预料的一样
Natural causes. As we always thought.

388
00:31:02,745 --> 00:31:05,685
菲尔菲克斯小姐死于自然因素
Miss Fairfax died of natural causes.

389
00:31:05,705 --> 00:31:08,786
很明显大脑供氧不足的危险...
Obviously the danger with cerebral hypoxia...

390
00:31:26,789 --> 00:31:28,789
我回来了  亲爱的
I'm home, dearest.

391
00:31:30,649 --> 00:31:32,830
我们还有足够的时间送你去特拉斯科特家
We want ample time to get you to the Truscotts'.

392
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:37,691
你今天回来的比以前早  亲爱的
You're early, darling.

393
00:31:37,711 --> 00:31:40,831
我知道吉妮就指望着你帮忙呢  还有啊  莉莉
I know how Jeannie's relying on you.Something else,Lil.

394
00:31:41,771 --> 00:31:43,632
还有件事我要告诉你
Something else.

395
00:31:43,812 --> 00:31:45,672
我没有失误
I didn't make a mistake.

396
00:31:45,692 --> 00:31:48,853
- 我很确定你没有  - 但是  事实证明我真没有
- No. I was sure. - But, you see, I wasn't.

397
00:31:49,833 --> 00:31:53,833
我知道我所做的事正一点一点将我给吞噬
I know what I am doing and all this has been eating me up.

398
00:31:53,853 --> 00:31:55,873
可是为什么呢
For what reason?

399
00:32:00,674 --> 00:32:01,674
莉莉
Lily?

400
00:32:26,838 --> 00:32:29,639
谢谢
Thank you.

401
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:33,860
晚安
Good night.

402
00:32:51,762 --> 00:32:54,823
我一直努力控制自己的情感  但我就是做不到
All I want to do is stop feeling
what I'm feeling, but I can't,

403
00:32:54,843 --> 00:32:57,683
我真的不知道接下来该如何是好
and I do not know what to do any more.

404
00:32:58,724 --> 00:33:00,844
我只是想待在你身边  仅此而已
I just want to be near you, nothing more.

405
00:33:11,666 --> 00:33:13,686
- 晚安  - 晚安
- Good night. - Good night.

406
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:19,667
你觉得我跟那个护士有...戏吗  先生
That nurse.Do you think...me and her?Sir?

407
00:33:20,727 --> 00:33:22,727
谁知道呢  是吧
Well, you never know, do you?

408
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,591
你想打给你的丈夫吗  道尔顿太太
Would you like to telephone
your husband, Mrs Dalton?

409
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:46,571
我一直觉得婚姻是我人生的枷锁  鲍威尔医生
I always found marriage rather too
ball-and-chain for my taste,Dr Powell.

410
00:33:48,591 --> 00:33:50,592
那你结婚了吗
Is there anyone?

411
00:33:52,452 --> 00:33:55,513
我开着一家餐馆跟夜总会  你觉得呢
I run a restaurant and a night club.What do you think?

412
00:33:59,354 --> 00:34:01,434
那情况严重吗？
So, it's that serious?

413
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:06,355
如果能再做个活细胞组织检查的话我就能知道更多
The tests - the biopsy - should tell me more.

414
00:34:08,354 --> 00:34:09,595
当然
Yes.

415
00:34:10,535 --> 00:34:13,395
我一直都“活在当下”
Well, I always argued "live for the moment".

416
00:34:15,396 --> 00:34:17,456
我想我一直都是个傻瓜
I suppose I've been a fool.

417
00:34:18,376 --> 00:34:20,457
你一个月之前就该来找我的
You should have come to see me months ago.

418
00:34:20,477 --> 00:34:22,557
- 这些症状… - 对  正如我所说…
- The symptoms - Yeah，like I said, I...

419
00:34:25,478 --> 00:34:28,398
你要怎么跟理查德・特拉斯科特说
What are you going to say to Richard Truscott?

420
00:34:31,499 --> 00:34:34,359
你到底怎么知道这些事的
How on earth do you know about that?

421
00:34:34,379 --> 00:34:36,399
就在晚宴上他把你介绍给我们的那一刻
The moment he introduced us at dinner.

422
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,520
你不必独自面对
You don't have to face this alone.

423
00:34:45,421 --> 00:34:47,561
我真不知道该如何是好
I'm not entirely sure what I'm going to do.

424
00:34:56,443 --> 00:34:58,483
几点了
What time is it?

425
00:34:59,483 --> 00:35:01,503
- 已经晚了  - 那简怎么办
- Late.- Well, what about Jean?

426
00:35:08,504 --> 00:35:12,445
莉儿  你到底跑哪去了
Oh, Lil. Where the sodding heck are you?

427
00:35:16,586 --> 00:35:18,526
来了  莉儿
Coming, Lil!

428
00:35:18,546 --> 00:35:22,507
我知道我们来早了  但穿成这样
I know we are early but one cannot
make sense of the London Underground

429
00:35:22,527 --> 00:35:26,367
我们不好意思在伦敦的大街上多待
and we could hardly walk the streets dressed like this.

430
00:35:27,367 --> 00:35:29,487
这是我贤内  梅塔教授
This is my good wife, Professor Mehta,

431
00:35:29,507 --> 00:35:33,388
但我们通常都称她为帕特丽夏
but we mere mortals are sometimes
allowed to call her Patricia.

432
00:35:33,408 --> 00:35:34,588
快请进
Please, do come in.

433
00:35:34,608 --> 00:35:36,529
谢谢
Thank you.

434
00:35:37,429 --> 00:35:38,549
喝酒吗  我给你们…
Drink? What can I...?

435
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:41,390
呃  特拉斯科特医生呢
Oh, where is Dr Truscott?

436
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:46,591
他还沉浸在他的工作中  杜松子酒如何
Oh,he's just obsessed by his patients,
working every hour. God...Gin?

437
00:35:48,551 --> 00:35:50,552
晚上好
Good evening.

438
00:36:03,493 --> 00:36:05,574
天呐  我真想死你了
My God, I want you so badly. I really do.

439
00:36:07,534 --> 00:36:10,475
- 我都在楼下滑了一跤  - 你已经家有贤妻了
- I slipped in downstairs. - You've got a perfectly good wife.

440
00:36:10,495 --> 00:36:13,395
- 难道鱼与熊掌不能兼得吗  - 你真坏
- Can't I have both of you? - You are monstrous.

441
00:36:13,495 --> 00:36:16,416
别  不行  理查德   真不行  别这样
No, Richard. No. No. Seriously.

442
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:21,396
若五年之后我们皆在人世  到了那时我们再见吧
If we're all still alive in five years,let's meet again.

443
00:36:21,416 --> 00:36:23,456
别动真感情
As adults.

444
00:36:23,616 --> 00:36:26,377
我们只是为了取乐而已
Just for pleasure.

445
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,600
我们真是幸运
We are ever so lucky.

446
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:46,580
遇到了理查德的父母这么慷慨的人
Richard's parents were frightfully generous.

447
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,440
他真是有福气
He was in oil.

448
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:52,361
他去过印度  也许你见过他
He went to India. Maybe you met him.

449
00:36:53,621 --> 00:36:55,521
哦  这一定是莉儿了
Oh. That'll be Lil.

450
00:36:55,541 --> 00:36:57,542
我去开吧
I'll go.

451
00:36:58,542 --> 00:37:02,443
那…教授在哪高就
So...a professor? Of...?

452
00:37:02,463 --> 00:37:05,403
伦敦大学   国际关系学
International affairs. University Of London.

453
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:07,544
天呐  你一定聪明绝顶
Gosh almighty. You must be an absolute brainbox.

454
00:37:11,625 --> 00:37:14,504
- 杜松子酒加奎宁  谢谢  - 简
- Gin and tonic, please. - Jean.

455
00:37:15,444 --> 00:37:17,425
亲爱的
Dearest.

456
00:37:24,486 --> 00:37:27,487
托马斯在塞尔西的时候十分焦虑
Thomas got very anxious in Selsey.

457
00:37:27,507 --> 00:37:29,567
孩子总在担心些事儿
Children worry at things.

458
00:37:29,587 --> 00:37:33,448
我所做的一切都是为了托马斯
Everything-and I mean everything I do-is for Thomas,

459
00:37:33,468 --> 00:37:35,488
仅仅是为了他
and Thomas alone.

460
00:37:35,508 --> 00:37:37,509
别再问了  J太太
Please, Mrs J.

461
00:37:39,388 --> 00:37:40,608
现在…
Now...

462
00:37:40,628 --> 00:37:42,489
我再不走就迟到了
I shouldn't be late.

463
00:37:42,509 --> 00:37:46,450
而且我现在不确定鲍威尔现在是会准时去那里
And I'm not at all sure whether Mr
Powell will be back in time to join me

464
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:48,430
还是会直接回家
or whether he'll come straight home.

465
00:37:58,512 --> 00:38:00,532
好了  交给我吧
Right. Let's take a look.

466
00:38:08,553 --> 00:38:10,473
简  你焖了多久
Jean, when did you put this in?

467
00:38:10,493 --> 00:38:12,614
没多久啊  就刚刚
Just now, a second ago.

468
00:38:12,634 --> 00:38:15,534
她醒来的第一句话就问“我的手镯呢”
The first thing she said was,"Where's my bracelet?"

469
00:38:15,554 --> 00:38:17,535
“医生 我的手镯呢”整个手术室的人都说
"Doctor,where's my bracelet?"All the theatre could

470
00:38:17,605 --> 00:38:20,535
“幸亏你没丢到别的地方”
say was, "Luckily,not where you left it."

471
00:38:22,916 --> 00:38:24,216
这真搞笑
That's really quite funny.

472
00:38:24,036 --> 00:38:26,276
谢谢 干了
Thank you. Boom-boom.

473
00:38:27,537 --> 00:38:29,417
- 我的儿啊  - 哈
- Dearest. - Ah.

474
00:38:30,637 --> 00:38:32,877
真是辛苦了
You're working too hard.

475
00:38:33,597 --> 00:38:35,617
你不觉得你母亲过誉了吗  特拉斯科特医生
Are you feeling guilty, Dr Truscott?

476
00:38:36,577 --> 00:38:37,498
嗯
Mm.

477
00:38:38,018 --> 00:38:41,078
- 这是给你的亲爱的  - 你去哪了 回来这么晚
- Ah. These are for you, darling.
- Where have you been? You're late.

478
00:38:41,098 --> 00:38:45,079
你今早答应我不会迟到  你答应过我跟我讲真话
You promised me this morning you wouldn't be late.
You promised you would tell me the truth.

479
00:38:45,099 --> 00:38:47,920
梅塔教授  你认识强尼・唐科沃斯吗
Professor Mehta, do you know Johnny Dankworth?

480
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:50,100
现在才刚刚八点啊  我还不得去花店买花吗
It's eight o'clock.I had to go to the florist.

481
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:53,941
真是场盛宴啊
What a spread.

482
00:38:55,081 --> 00:38:57,101
这个真好吃  简
This is delicious, Jean.

483
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:00,961
你应该告诉他们我们是素食主义者
You should have said we were vegetarians.

484
00:39:00,981 --> 00:39:03,962
你看起来气色不错  安德伯雷太太  有什么好事吗
You look quite transformed, Mrs
Enderbury. Something changed?

485
00:39:03,982 --> 00:39:06,042
没有啊  你想说什么呢
No. Whatever do you mean?

486
00:39:06,062 --> 00:39:08,143
大家干杯
Cheers, everyone.

487
00:39:10,103 --> 00:39:13,104
我不知道酒还够不够了
I wonder if we haven't had enough.

488
00:39:14,144 --> 00:39:16,964
够了  母亲
Now, Mother...

489
00:39:16,984 --> 00:39:17,725
- 你想说什么 亲爱的
- Whatever do you mean, dearest?

490
00:39:17,805 --> 00:39:20,025
- 你就让简喝吧
- Let Jeannie be.

491
00:39:22,105 --> 00:39:25,026
你说了算
Whatever you say.

492
00:39:27,045 --> 00:39:28,646
- 非常荣幸见到你们
- It's been a delight to meet you.

493
00:39:28,656 --> 00:39:30,946
- 你也不必走啊  母亲
- You don't have to go, Mother.

494
00:39:31,926 --> 00:39:33,987
可是很明显我们在这不受欢迎
But we're clearly not welcome here.

495
00:39:34,987 --> 00:39:36,147
你们当然受欢迎
Of course you are.

496
00:39:38,007 --> 00:39:40,028
特拉斯科特 过来
Mr Truscott.

497
00:39:43,008 --> 00:39:45,009
鲍威尔夫人 也很荣幸见到你
Mrs Powell, it's always a pleasure.

498
00:39:45,029 --> 00:39:47,029
求你们别走
Please don't go.

499
00:39:47,949 --> 00:39:50,930
邀请你们大家一起对我意义重大
It meant everything to me,
inviting you and everyone,

500
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:52,070
而且 我…
and I...

501
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:54,930
我知道我不该喝酒
I should have known not to drink.

502
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:59,091
不应该去做红酒烩牛肉
Not to try and cook...boeuf sodding bourguignon.

503
00:40:00,111 --> 00:40:02,951
就算是莉儿帮忙我也不…
Even with Lil I can't...

504
00:40:04,072 --> 00:40:08,913
我知道我一直都很让你失望  特拉斯科特太太
I know I've always been, and always
will be,a disappointment to you,Mrs Truscott.

505
00:40:08,933 --> 00:40:10,093
- 我真的做不出什么能让您满意的事  - 吉妮
- There's nothing I can do about that.- Jeannie.

506
00:40:10,113 --> 00:40:12,033
不 瑞奇
No, Richie.

507
00:40:13,113 --> 00:40:16,934
你爱干嘛干嘛去  那从那儿回来就去哪儿去
Do what you want.Go back to wherever it is you go.

508
00:40:16,954 --> 00:40:19,015
之前干嘛现在还干嘛去
Keep doing whatever it is you're doing.

509
00:40:19,035 --> 00:40:22,094
我爱你  但我不能没有…
I love you but I can't live without...

510
00:40:22,114 --> 00:40:24,135
你的爱
love.

511
00:40:36,157 --> 00:40:39,918
顺便提一句  我看到圣奥尔本斯玛丽女王
Oh,by the way,I see they're advertising
for a new Head Of Department

512
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:41,138
召厅长的广告
at Queen Mary's in St Albans.

513
00:40:41,158 --> 00:40:43,938
我觉得我可以去碰碰运气
Thought I might try my luck.

514
00:40:43,958 --> 00:40:45,898
嗯
Mm.

515
00:40:45,918 --> 00:40:47,138
你觉得如何
What do you say?

516
00:40:47,158 --> 00:40:51,019
你当然不能永远活在鲍威尔的影子下
Well, you certainly can't be
in Mr Powell's shadow for ever,

517
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:52,559
肯定的
that's a definite.

518
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,100
准备好走了吗  亲爱的
Are you ready, dear?

519
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,120
我们也该走了
Shall we?

520
00:41:00,961 --> 00:41:02,961
再见 安德伯雷太太
Mrs Enderbury.

521
00:41:15,143 --> 00:41:17,163
待在房里别出来
Stay there.

522
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:22,044
吉妮
Jeannie?

523
00:41:23,044 --> 00:41:25,105
我不能再装下去了
I can't pretend to be someone I'm not.

524
00:41:27,125 --> 00:41:30,986
我觉得理查德对我连装都不想装一下了
And Richard can't pretend to care for me,I suppose.

525
00:41:31,006 --> 00:41:33,066
他就这样的人
I think he does, you know.

526
00:41:34,927 --> 00:41:37,107
- 你就尽说哄我开心的话吧  - 没有
- You're just saying what I want to hear.- No.

527
00:41:37,127 --> 00:41:41,987
因为他不知道该如何想你表达他的情感
Because...he doesn't know
how to show you what he feels.

528
00:41:44,067 --> 00:41:46,088
但那个女人
But that woman.

529
00:41:46,108 --> 00:41:51,149
我怀疑你丈夫在隐瞒他的真实情感
I suspect there's a lot of your husband
pretending not to feel what he really feels.

530
00:42:20,033 --> 00:42:22,054
- J太太  - 鲍威尔夫人呢
- Mrs J - Where's Mrs Powell?

531
00:42:23,054 --> 00:42:24,994
她说她什么时候回来
When did she say she'd be home?

532
00:42:25,014 --> 00:42:28,075
十一点  她去特拉斯科特家赴宴去了
At eleven.She was dining with Mr and Mrs Truscott.

533
00:42:28,095 --> 00:42:30,055
