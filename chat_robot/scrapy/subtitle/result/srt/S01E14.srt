1
00:00:00,742 --> 00:00:03,203
星际之门之亚特兰蒂斯 前情提要
Previously, on Stargate Atlantis...

2
00:00:03,244 --> 00:00:04,287
我们对幽灵知道些多少？
What do we know about the Wraith?

3
00:00:04,329 --> 00:00:08,625
所知不多  其中之一就是它们是打败古人的敌人
One of the few things we do know is that
they are the enemy that defeated the ancients.

4
00:00:09,459 --> 00:00:12,795
有时 几百年后它们才会再次醒来
Sometimes, a few hundred years
will pass before they awaken again.

5
00:00:12,837 --> 00:00:15,298
我们已经到过很多很多星球了
We have visited many, many worlds.

6
00:00:15,715 --> 00:00:18,092
据有所知 没有哪个没有被幽灵所蹂躏的
I know of none untouched by the Wraith.

7
00:00:18,134 --> 00:00:22,680
你们注定是会灭亡的
就跟许多与你们同路的人类一样
You are doomed, as are any
humans that stand in our way.

8
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:25,475
古人曾经研究过"升天"
The ancients were researching ascension.

9
00:00:25,516 --> 00:00:26,768
"升天"到底是什么意思?
What exactly is ascension?

10
00:00:26,809 --> 00:00:28,436
一个他们所能够达到的更高级的阶段
An advanced stage of being where they were able

11
00:00:28,478 --> 00:00:29,938
让他们摆脱自己的肉身
to rid themselves of their physical bodies

12
00:00:29,979 --> 00:00:31,397
上升到一个更高的存在形式
and rise to a higher plane of existence,

13
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,025
最终他们纯粹以能量形式生存
one in which they live as pure energy.

14
00:00:42,825 --> 00:00:44,744
- 我数到二, 准备好了么?
- 是的, 长官
- I count two. How about you?
- Yes, sir.

15
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:47,413
- 我建议现在立刻进行回击
- 我正在努力
- I recommend shooting back any time now.
- I'm trying.

16
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:50,750
- 刚才的一击一定造成了一些损坏. McKay?
- 我就去看看
- That hit must've caused some damage. McKay?
- I'm on it.

17
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:52,502
它们是从哪里来的?
Where did they come from?

18
00:00:53,503 --> 00:00:56,256
她是对的  那些看似飞标的物体正是短程战斗机
She's right. The darts are short-range fighters.

19
00:00:56,297 --> 00:00:58,675
这附近一定有一艘母船
There's probably a hive ship around here somewhere.

20
00:00:58,841 --> 00:01:00,718
- 那么我们应该马上离开这里
- 是的
- Then we need to get out of here.
- Yes, we do.

21
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:03,596
星际之门在另外一边
行星的另一侧
The Stargate's the other way,
on the other side of the planet.

22
00:01:03,638 --> 00:01:05,431
是, 我们现在简直就像是在观光漫步  McKay!
Yeah, we're taking the scenic route. McKay!

23
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:06,641
我就快搞定了!
I've almost there!

24
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:09,018
有一个正在我们身后!
There's one on our tail!

25
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,146
谢谢, 我也知道
把你的眼睛用来盯住另外那个
Thank you, I know all about that one.
Keep your eye on the other one.

26
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:13,273
OK, 你应该可以用武器了
Okay, you should have weapons now.

27
00:01:13,314 --> 00:01:14,440
- 不行
- 你确信?
- Negative.
- Are you sure?

28
00:01:14,524 --> 00:01:16,526
- 肯定
- 我非常肯定我已经把它修好了
- Positive!
- I'm pretty sure I fixed it.

29
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,070
好吧, 实际上你根本就没有!
Well, obviously you didn't!

30
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,949
也许你可以在大气层中把它们甩掉
Perhaps you can lose them in
the atmosphere of the planet.

31
00:01:23,032 --> 00:01:24,492
两点钟方向又来了两艘
Two more darts on our two o'clock.

32
00:01:24,534 --> 00:01:25,785
我看到了. McKay!
I see them. McKay!

33
00:01:25,827 --> 00:01:27,579
我看起来可不是正在故意妨碍你
It's not like I'm holding back on you.

34
00:01:43,553 --> 00:01:44,554
抓好!
Hang on!

35
00:01:57,734 --> 00:01:59,235
幽灵的梭镖飞船已经被消灭了
The Wraith darts have been destroyed.

36
00:01:59,277 --> 00:02:00,486
好, 这是件好事
Well, that's a good thing.

37
00:02:02,488 --> 00:02:07,118
我敢肯定我们已经死了
你们认为我们现在死了么
I thought for sure we were dead.
Didn't you think we were dead?

38
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,161
那到底是什么?
What the hell was that?

39
00:02:08,203 --> 00:02:09,996
某种, 嗯, 能量武器?
Some sort of, uh, energy weapon?

40
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:12,790
你说我们发现了什么?
What do you say we find out?

41
00:03:10,506 --> 00:03:16,220
星际之门之亚特兰蒂斯
第一季第14集 避难所
Season 1: Episode 14 Sanctuary

42
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:26,990
那么, 肯定一下, 我们仍然...
So just to confirm, we're all still...

43
00:03:28,157 --> 00:03:29,242
明确的说还没有死
definitely not dead.

44
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:31,744
我感觉活得很好
I feel very much alive.

45
00:03:31,786 --> 00:03:32,912
很好  我也一样
Good. Same here.

46
00:03:32,954 --> 00:03:34,455
我很想知道那到底是什么
I wish I knew what that was.

47
00:03:34,497 --> 00:03:35,415
看起来像闪电
Looked like lightning.

48
00:03:35,456 --> 00:03:36,457
太空闪电?
Space lightning?

49
00:03:36,499 --> 00:03:39,961
我已经说了, 那是某种能量武器
显然是它摧毁了幽灵的飞船
I already said, it's some sort of an energy weapon,
one that apparently destroys Wraith darts.

50
00:03:40,003 --> 00:03:42,088
不错, 但为什么摧毁的只是它们而不是我们?
Nice, but why them and not us?

51
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:46,009
好吧, 假设我们仍然还活着
而且也没有任何损坏
Well, assuming that we're still alive,
and there doesn't appear to be any damage

52
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,469
从脉搏的结果来看
我想我们可以确实的得出结论, 嗯...
as a result of the pulse,
I think we can safely conclude that, uh...

53
00:03:53,474 --> 00:03:54,058
我什么也没有得到
I got nothing.

54
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:56,519
我的意思是, 我没有得到什么结论
I mean, I got nothing to conclude.

55
00:03:56,561 --> 00:03:58,438
我只是为了说话而说话
I'm just talking for the sake of talking.

56
00:03:58,479 --> 00:03:59,230
你确信你还好吧?
Are you sure you're okay?

57
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:01,524
你知道我是多么憎恶死亡?
You know how much I hate certain death?

58
00:04:01,566 --> 00:04:02,734
你还活着
You're alive.

59
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:05,820
这会是某种自然现象么?
Could something like that be naturally occurring?

60
00:04:05,862 --> 00:04:08,031
肯定不是
My money's on non-naturally occurring.

61
00:04:08,072 --> 00:04:09,449
有没可能是古人留下的武器?
Like a weapon the ancients left behind?

62
00:04:10,033 --> 00:04:12,660
任何有如此威力的武器
的能量来源一定是...
And any weapon that impressive
would have to be powered by...

63
00:04:12,702 --> 00:04:14,078
- ... 零点模块
- 对
- ... a zero-point module.
- That's right.

64
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,580
好吧, 我们需要下去
All right, we need to get down there.

65
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:18,333
不管怎么说, 在我们返回亚特兰蒂斯之前
需要检查一下有没有什么损坏
I've got to check for damage anyway
before we head back to Atlantis.

66
00:04:32,513 --> 00:04:36,309
如果下面某个地方确实有这种武器
长官, 那也肯定不是这些家伙造的
If there is a weapon somewhere down here,
sir, these folks didn't build it.

67
00:04:36,726 --> 00:04:37,685
不是这些孩子们
Not these kids.

68
00:04:39,187 --> 00:04:40,480
你发现什么了么?
You picking up anything?

69
00:04:40,521 --> 00:04:42,732
我正在检查一切
没有什么值得关注的
I'm picking up everything,
just nothing worth mentioning.

70
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:45,735
这些人看起来跟你比较亲近, Teyla?
These folks look familiar to you, Teyla?

71
00:04:45,777 --> 00:04:49,030
星际之门是在轨道中, 少校
我的人们不可能探险来到这里
The Stargate is in orbit, Major.
My people could never have ventured here.

72
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:52,992
对
那我们去探险如何?
Right.
What say we venture?

73
00:05:17,225 --> 00:05:18,226
嗨
Hi.

74
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:23,606
没事. 我们很友好
It's okay. We're friendly.

75
00:05:25,275 --> 00:05:25,858
嗨
Hi.

76
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:31,197
看起来他们好像没有见过村子外的人.
It is likely they have never seen
anyone from outside their village.

77
00:05:45,503 --> 00:05:46,337
欢迎
Welcome.

78
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:51,885
我叫Zarah, Proculis的一个修道士
I am Zarah, one of the abbots of Proculis.

79
00:05:52,427 --> 00:05:54,470
我是John. John Sheppard.
I'm John. John Sheppard.

80
00:05:54,512 --> 00:05:57,974
这是Teyla, Ford中尉, 以及McKay博士
This is Teyla, lieutenant Ford, and dr. McKay.

81
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,978
请, 来吧
Please, come.

82
00:06:24,042 --> 00:06:31,966
这是我生命中第一次看到
其他国家的人来到我们这里
This is the first time at least in my own lifetime
that people from another land have come to us.

83
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:34,093
嗯, 我们是坐飞船来的
Well, we came by ship.

84
00:06:36,971 --> 00:06:42,769
一个可以飞的东西
可以把我们从一个星球带到另外一个星球
A flying thing that allows us
to move from one world to another.

85
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,187
另一个星球?
Another world?

86
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:47,148
从你们夜晚看到的星星中间
From among the stars you see in the night sky.

87
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,443
我们是和平的探险者
We are peaceful explorers.

88
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:55,573
那么感谢Athar把你们安全的带到这里
Then glory to Athar for bringing you here safely.

89
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:57,575
Athar?
Athar?

90
00:06:58,117 --> 00:07:01,746
我们所有人的供应者... 和保护者
The provider... and protector of all.

91
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:03,373
你们应该知道
Surely you know.

92
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:06,960
Athar是我们所知诸多星辰中的一个
Athar is known by many names among the stars.

93
00:07:07,001 --> 00:07:09,712
嗯... Athar在周围么?
Is, um... Athar around?

94
00:07:09,921 --> 00:07:12,799
我们很想跟他谈谈.
我们是, 嗯, 朋友
We'd love to talk to him.
We're, uh, friends.

95
00:07:13,007 --> 00:07:17,220
Athar是我们所有人的朋友, 而且他永远和我们在一起
Athar is friend to all, and with us always.

96
00:07:17,887 --> 00:07:20,098
即使是现在
Even now.

97
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:21,474
当然
Of course.

98
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:24,102
嗨, Athar.
Hi, Athar.

99
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:28,314
McKay博士的意思是
我们想表达我们的谢意
What dr. McKay means is that
we wish to offer our thanks.

100
00:07:28,356 --> 00:07:31,192
我们被幽灵袭击
We were attacked by the Wraith
and would have been killed,

101
00:07:31,234 --> 00:07:33,361
如果不是Athar的干涉
我们几乎就被它们杀死了
were it not for Athar's intervention.

102
00:07:34,237 --> 00:07:35,113
"幽灵"?
"Wraith"?

103
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:39,993
苍白的皮肤, 深陷的眼睛
用手将你的生命吸取出来
Pale skin, sunken eyes,
suck the life out of you with their hands?

104
00:07:40,243 --> 00:07:43,079
我们从来没有碰到过这种事情
We have never encountered such beings.

105
00:07:43,413 --> 00:07:44,455
从来?
Never?

106
00:07:46,082 --> 00:07:49,043
而且你们的历史中也从来没有提及?
And there is no mention of them in your history?

107
00:07:49,085 --> 00:07:49,919
没有
None.

108
00:07:49,961 --> 00:07:54,716
我可以向你保证, 几千年来
我们都生活在和平之中
I can assure you that for many thousands of years,
we have lived here in peace.

109
00:07:57,802 --> 00:07:59,846
能让我们离开一会儿么?
Could you excuse us for a moment?

110
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:06,394
当然. 不过不是现在  在我们会见Chaya之前
我要告诉其他的修道士你们的到来
Of course. Please, I must tell the other abbots
of your arrival before we go to meet with Chaya.

111
00:08:06,436 --> 00:08:08,187
那么Chaya又是...
And Chaya is...

112
00:08:08,229 --> 00:08:10,565
Athar的女祭司
The high priestess of Athar.

113
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:13,693
这对我们人民来说是伟大的一天
This is a great day for our people.

114
00:08:17,405 --> 00:08:18,448
对我们也是
Ours too.

115
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:24,120
不是开玩笑
这真的有作用?
I'm not kidding. This could really work.

116
00:08:24,162 --> 00:08:25,205
我同意, 少校
I agree, Major.

117
00:08:25,246 --> 00:08:29,876
在这个星系中, 所有我访问过的星球
都曾经遭受过幽灵的蹂躏
Every inhabited world I have encountered
in this galaxy has been ravaged by the Wraith.

118
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:32,212
嗯, 这个星球受到了古人的武器的保护
Well, this planet is protected
by an Ancient weapon.

119
00:08:32,253 --> 00:08:33,463
这正好可以肯定这一点
This just confirms it.

120
00:08:33,504 --> 00:08:33,838
是么?
Does it?

121
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,006
好吧, 没有第二种解释了
Well, there's no other explanation.

122
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:37,592
我的意思是, 那种东西对能量的需求
是相当惊人的
I mean, the power requirements of
something like that must be astronomical.

123
00:08:37,634 --> 00:08:39,177
只有 Z.P.M. 可以产生那种能量
Only a Z.P.M. could generate that.

124
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:42,513
而且现在...在技术上
他们还没有发达到那种地步
And yet... they do not appear
to be technologically advanced.

125
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:47,185
除非刚才那个家伙在撒谎
但他不像是会撒谎的那种人
Unless that guy was lying,
but he doesn't seem like the lying type.

126
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:49,854
那么, 自动防御?
So, automated defenses.

127
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:54,817
想象一下, 有这样一个星球
可以把其他星球上的难民转移过来, 和平的生活
Imagine a world where displaced refugees from
dozens of planets could come and live in peace,

128
00:08:54,859 --> 00:08:57,195
不用再担心会被幽灵抓去
without fear of being culled by the Wraith.

129
00:08:57,278 --> 00:08:59,572
也许我们可以跟他们谈判
Maybe we can negotiate some kind of treaty.

130
00:08:59,614 --> 00:09:01,699
最好我们能被允许使用那个武器, 那个Z.P.M.
We just need access to that
weapon better still, the Z.P.M.,

131
00:09:01,991 --> 00:09:03,868
实在不行我们就去偷了它
not that we'd steal it or anything.

132
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,287
我们应该尽量光明正大一点
Let's just try to stay on our best behavior.

133
00:09:06,329 --> 00:09:07,997
我总是光明正大的
I'm always on my best behavior.

134
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:14,546
有多远?
How much farther?

135
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:15,672
不是很远
Not very.

136
00:09:15,713 --> 00:09:16,714
噢, 很好
Oh, good.

137
00:09:18,675 --> 00:09:20,218
瞧? 我们本可以坐飞船去的
See? We could have taken the jumper.

138
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,427
对你来说, 锻炼一下不是坏事
The exercise is good for you.

139
00:09:22,136 --> 00:09:24,013
Chaya住得离你的人民确实远了点
Chaya does live pretty far from your people.

140
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:27,976
这很不寻常, 少校
牧师竟然不是住在社区当中
It is not uncommon, Major,
for clerics to live apart from the community.

141
00:09:58,047 --> 00:09:59,173
以伟大Athar的名义
Glory to Athar.

142
00:09:59,215 --> 00:10:00,925
欢迎, 请就便
Welcome, and rest.

143
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,635
谢谢你, 女教士
Thank you, sister.

144
00:10:04,721 --> 00:10:06,097
对Proculis来说,  你们都是新人
You are new to Proculis.

145
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:08,099
是的,  我们...
Yes. We're, uh...

146
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:09,601
我们是"崭新的", 事实上
we're brand new, in fact.

147
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:12,562
John Sheppard少校
Major John Sheppard.

148
00:10:12,604 --> 00:10:15,440
我的名字叫Chaya Sar.
I am called Chaya Sar.

149
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:17,191
那么你是...
And you are...

150
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:18,484
Teyla...
Teyla...

151
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:21,112
Ford中尉, 以及McKay博士
Lieutenant Ford, and Dr. McKay.

152
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:22,655
她是怎么知道的?
How did she know that?

153
00:10:22,697 --> 00:10:23,573
噢, 这都不懂
Oh, please.

154
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:24,991
有个修道士先来过了
One of the abbots ran ahead.

155
00:10:25,033 --> 00:10:26,993
很高兴见到你, Chaya.
It's a pleasure to meet you, Chaya.

156
00:10:28,411 --> 00:10:30,330
走了这么远, 你们一定累了吧
You must be tired after your long journey.

157
00:10:30,371 --> 00:10:32,248
我可以去准备些茶么?
Shall I prepare some tea for us?

158
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,669
我想我们也正想这么说
I was hoping you were going to say just that.

159
00:10:40,423 --> 00:10:42,258
那么那些幽灵是从哪里来的?
And where do they come from, these Wraith?

160
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,179
看起来它们在这个星系中无处不在
They seem to be everywhere in this galaxy,
and they appear to have been on top

161
00:10:46,221 --> 00:10:47,513
而且看起来在很长一段时间内
它们处于食物链的顶端
of the food chain for a long time.

162
00:10:47,555 --> 00:10:48,723
这太恐怖了
It's terrifying.

163
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:51,267
确实很恐怖
Truly terrifying.

164
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:54,312
我非常为你的人民担心, Teyla.
My heart goes out to your people, Teyla.

165
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:56,606
遭受厄运的不仅仅只是我的人民, Chaya.
It is not only my people who suffer, Chaya.

166
00:10:56,648 --> 00:10:59,275
幽灵已经从长时间的睡眠中苏醒过来了
The Wraith have awakened from a long sleep,

167
00:10:59,317 --> 00:11:03,238
不过在已经开始的选择中(指幽灵选择食物)
这整个星球看起来却是安全的
and this entire world is safe from
the culling that has already begun.

168
00:11:03,613 --> 00:11:08,785
即便是亚特兰蒂斯, 即使有那么多的奇迹
也可能经受不住冲击
Even Atlantis, with all its wonder,
may not survive the onslaught.

169
00:11:08,826 --> 00:11:13,915
我们共同希望Athar
允许在Proculis, 也就是在这里, 建立避难所
It is our hope that Athar
could grant sanctuary here on Proculis.

170
00:11:13,957 --> 00:11:15,083
避难所?
Sanctuary?

171
00:11:17,835 --> 00:11:18,878
为如此之多的人?
For so many?

172
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:23,091
嗯, 我们并不是说这个星系中所有的人
都会出现在你的门口
Well, we're not talking about everybody
in the galaxy showing up on your doorstep.

173
00:11:23,132 --> 00:11:24,884
这个行星很大, 女士
This planet is pretty big, ma'am.

174
00:11:24,926 --> 00:11:26,803
而且大部分无人居住
And it is largely uninhabited.

175
00:11:26,844 --> 00:11:30,056
更重要的是
它受到你们那种武器的保护
More importantly,
it is protected by that weapon of yours.

176
00:11:30,098 --> 00:11:31,266
武器?
Weapon?

177
00:11:31,307 --> 00:11:33,393
我想在Proculis没有这种东西
I am aware of no such thing on Proculis.

178
00:11:35,853 --> 00:11:37,438
你确信?
Are you sure about that?

179
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,565
是的
Yes.

180
00:11:38,606 --> 00:11:39,857
噢, 不要这样
Oh, please.

181
00:11:40,191 --> 00:11:41,943
Rodney, 表现好一点
Rodney, best behavior.

182
00:11:41,985 --> 00:11:43,861
这跟我们得到的已经是一样好了, 少校
This is as good as it gets, Major.

183
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:47,907
Chaya, 我们还活着的唯一原因就是
Chaya, the only reason we're alive
is because of a powerful energy weapon

184
00:11:47,949 --> 00:11:49,993
从这个星球表面某处发射出来的
某种强大的能量武器
that emanated from somewhere
on the surface of this planet.

185
00:11:50,034 --> 00:11:52,453
它摧毁了朝我们射击的飞船
It destroyed the ships that were shooting at us.

186
00:11:52,495 --> 00:11:54,497
正是那个武器使幽灵无法靠近
That weapon is what's keeping the Wraith away.

187
00:11:54,539 --> 00:11:55,415
不,  McKay博士
No, Dr. McKay.

188
00:11:55,456 --> 00:11:57,292
是Athar保护了你们
It was Athar who protected you.

189
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:58,418
Athar?
Athar?

190
00:11:58,459 --> 00:11:59,419
是的
Yes.

191
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,296
Athar看到你们需要他
Athar saw you were in need.

192
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:05,341
Chaya, 有非常多的人就像...
Chaya, there are a lot of people just like...

193
00:12:07,969 --> 00:12:11,389
你和我, 都需要他, 因为幽灵
you and me, who are in need because of the Wraith.

194
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:17,979
你们在这里所拥有的,  也就是Athar提供给你们的
是非常稀有的东西...
What you have here, what Athar
has provided you, is a very rare thing...

195
00:12:19,814 --> 00:12:21,816
不过我们需要把他也提供给更多的人
but we have a lot to offer too.

196
00:12:21,858 --> 00:12:25,445
这就是朋友所应该做的
他们共同分享
That's what friends do. They share.

197
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,698
我想我们可以互相帮助
I think we could help each other.

198
00:12:30,241 --> 00:12:31,451
我知道了
I understand.

199
00:12:33,244 --> 00:12:35,079
我现在应该和她商量一下
I shall consult with her now.

200
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:42,128
请待在这里
我不知道这需要多长时间
Please stay here.
I don't know how long this will take.

201
00:12:44,505 --> 00:12:45,256
谢谢
Thank you.

202
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:48,760
"Athar提供给你们的?"
"What Athar provides for you?"

203
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:49,844
你也想承认这些?
You're buying into this?

204
00:12:49,886 --> 00:12:51,221
Rodney...
Rodney...

205
00:12:51,262 --> 00:12:53,723
这些虔诚的人们怎么可能
不认真对待他们自己的宗教?
what religious people don't
take their religion seriously?

206
00:12:53,765 --> 00:12:55,475
那个武器并不是我们想象出来的, 少校
We didn't imagine that weapon, Major.

207
00:12:55,516 --> 00:12:58,269
我们亲眼看见了
而且我们也看见了它的能力
We saw it with our own eyes,
and we saw what it was capable of.

208
00:12:58,311 --> 00:12:59,354
是的, 我们确实看见了
Yes, we did.

209
00:12:59,395 --> 00:13:02,899
也许Chaya只是不知道那个武器的存在
Perhaps Chaya is simply
unaware of the weapon's existence.

210
00:13:02,941 --> 00:13:06,402
或许她知道, 不过她不想让我们也知道
Or she knows, and she wants
to keep it a secret from us.

211
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:08,529
从她对我说话的语气来看
也不像是在说谎
She doesn't strike me
as the lying type either.

212
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:14,661
好吧, 我们就看看Athar会说些什么
All right, let's just see
what Athar has to say.

213
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:19,499
就是说, "别管幕后那人是怎么说的", 是么?
So, "pay no attention to
the man behind the curtain," hmm?

214
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:20,542
很对
Exactly.

215
00:13:46,276 --> 00:13:46,901
少校
Major.

216
00:13:48,778 --> 00:13:51,781
我们已经向我们神圣的母亲
传达了你的请求
We have conveyed your
request to our divine mother,

217
00:13:51,823 --> 00:13:54,576
虽然她并没有怀疑你们行动的正义性,
and although she does not doubt
the righteousness of your mission,

218
00:13:54,617 --> 00:13:58,955
我恐怕还是要说, 她不会允许
除了她的子民之外的其他人居住在这里
I'm afraid she cannot countenance
any other people but hers settling here.

219
00:13:58,997 --> 00:14:01,583
你真的需要总是"唱"得这么好听么?
And you really had to chant
all that time to come up with that?

220
00:14:01,624 --> 00:14:02,792
McKay.
McKay.

221
00:14:02,834 --> 00:14:05,169
我们有没有办法请求Athar重新考虑一下?
Is there any way we can
ask Athar to reconsider?

222
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:10,675
Athar 理解且也很认同
那些幽灵是我们星球当中的灾难
Athar understands and sympathizes
these Wraith are a scourge among our stars

223
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:14,596
不过她必须把她自己人民的生命放在第一位
but she has to place the
lives of her people first.

224
00:14:15,805 --> 00:14:18,057
好吧, 我想我们在来这里很久之前
Well, I think we both knew
what you were going to say

225
00:14:18,099 --> 00:14:19,475
就已经都知道了你准备说的了
long before you even went in there.

226
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,269
我们祈求Athar的指引
We prayed for Athar's guidance.

227
00:14:21,311 --> 00:14:22,896
那么Athar是怎么说的?
And what did Athar say?

228
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:27,817
你们藏在你们所谓的信仰背后
来证明你们完完全全的自私自利
You're hiding behind your religion to
justify your complete and utter selfishness.

229
00:14:27,859 --> 00:14:28,735
Rodney...
Rodney...

230
00:14:28,776 --> 00:14:31,696
如果 Athar 确实存在, 她自己也会觉得羞愧
if Athar existed, she
would be ashamed of herself.

231
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:35,074
我们只是请求不被打扰, 平静的生活下去
We ask only to be left alone and in peace.

232
00:14:35,116 --> 00:14:38,912
所有数不清的成千上万的, 甚至上百万的
人就应该死去
So untold thousands, possibly millions
of people will die out there

233
00:14:38,953 --> 00:14:40,830
在他们可以被一个叫做Athar的人拯救的时候
when they could have been saved,
all in the name of Athar.

234
00:14:40,872 --> 00:14:42,582
你们可真, 真是平静啊
How very, very peaceful of you.

235
00:14:42,624 --> 00:14:44,292
你应该感激 Athar.
You should be grateful to Athar.

236
00:14:44,334 --> 00:14:45,793
这是在浪费时间
This is a waste of time.

237
00:14:45,835 --> 00:14:47,837
Athar 很抱歉她不能帮助你们
Athar regrets that she cannot help you.

238
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:49,881
而且我相信这就是她的原话
And I'm sure those were her exact words.

239
00:14:49,923 --> 00:14:50,757
够了
That's enough.

240
00:14:53,176 --> 00:14:54,469
回到飞船那里去
Head back to the jumper.

241
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,929
我过会就来
I'll be there in a minute.

242
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:56,846
为什么?
Why?

243
00:14:56,888 --> 00:14:57,889
因为你毫无帮助
Because you're not helping.

244
00:14:57,931 --> 00:14:58,932
是的, 长官
Yes, sir.

245
00:15:08,733 --> 00:15:10,401
我很抱歉
I apologize.

246
00:15:10,568 --> 00:15:13,655
他只是心直口快, 我们也是
He acts only in accordance
to his beliefs, as do we.

247
00:15:13,696 --> 00:15:16,991
不过 Rodney 说的没错
But Rodney is right about one thing.

248
00:15:17,033 --> 00:15:20,411
这事关生命,  人类的生命
This really is about lives, human lives.

249
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:24,123
迟早, 幽灵会出现在亚特兰蒂斯
到那时...
Sooner or later, the Wraith are going to
show up at Atlantis, and when they do...

250
00:15:24,165 --> 00:15:24,999
你是个武士
you're a warrior.

251
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:27,794
嗯, 我并不了解 "武士"
Well, I don't know about "warrior."

252
00:15:27,835 --> 00:15:29,045
这是你的职业, 少校
It is your vocation, Major.

253
00:15:29,712 --> 00:15:30,838
你将会战斗
You will fight.

254
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:36,094
我会努力的, 不过要知道我们所面对的
以及获胜的可能性...
I'll try, but knowing what
we're up against, and the odds...

255
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:46,396
瞧,  如果你能够请求Athar考虑一下
我们也是她的子民, 我会非常感激的
Look I'd appreciate it if you would ask
Athar to consider that we are her people.

256
00:15:46,437 --> 00:15:51,025
即便我们来自很远的地方, 我们都是相同的
Even though we come from
very far away, we're the same.

257
00:15:51,067 --> 00:15:54,028
我们都是人类, 这就是说我们不是陌生人
We're human, which means we're not strangers.

258
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:54,988
我们是一家人
We're family.

259
00:16:04,372 --> 00:16:05,582
傍晚的微风
Evening breeze.

260
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:09,544
我希望这是 Athar 的某种暗示
I was kind of hoping
it was a sign from Athar.

261
00:16:09,586 --> 00:16:12,171
你的话非常有说服力, Sheppard 少校
Your words are most
compelling, Major Sheppard.

262
00:16:12,213 --> 00:16:13,256
谢谢
Thank you.

263
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,466
我希望能够说服
I was going for compelling.

264
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:17,969
你真的认为我们是一家人?
Do you truly believe we are family?

265
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:19,137
我们是
We are.

266
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:20,471
我可以证明给你看
I can prove it to you.

267
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:21,347
怎么证明?
How?

268
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:22,765
回到亚特兰蒂斯
Come back to Atlantis.

269
00:16:22,807 --> 00:16:24,350
看我们真正是谁
See who we really are.

270
00:16:24,392 --> 00:16:26,436
一旦 Athar 了解我们更多...
Once Athar learns more about us...

271
00:16:26,477 --> 00:16:27,520
这可以接受
this is acceptable.

272
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:29,022
是么?
It is?

273
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:33,443
Chaya, 求你了, 你不能离开
Chaya, please, you cannot leave.

274
00:16:33,484 --> 00:16:38,031
Athar 永远和我们在一起
无论我们在哪里, Zarah.
Athar is with us always,
no matter where we are, Zarah.

275
00:16:43,912 --> 00:16:45,079
我明白了
I understand.

276
00:16:45,121 --> 00:16:51,711
我准备好了
I am ready.

277
00:16:55,798 --> 00:16:57,383
欢迎来到亚特兰蒂斯
Welcome to Atlantis.

278
00:16:57,634 --> 00:16:58,676
谢谢
Thank you.

279
00:16:58,927 --> 00:17:02,013
希望你不要介意
不过我们的医生确实需要对所有外星成员
I hope you don't mind, but our
doctors do require a medical exam

280
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:03,765
以及我们的访问者
of all off-planet team members

281
00:17:03,806 --> 00:17:06,976
进行医学检查
不过在那之后, 你就可以四处参观一下了
and our visitors, but after that,
perhaps you'd like a full tour.

282
00:17:07,018 --> 00:17:07,977
我会喜欢的
I would love that.

283
00:17:08,019 --> 00:17:10,313
Sheppard 少校已经同意这样做了
Major Sheppard has
already promised to do so.

284
00:17:10,355 --> 00:17:11,773
当然他会的
Of course he has.

285
00:17:11,814 --> 00:17:12,649
当然我会
Of course I have.

286
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:15,318
请随我到医务室...
Please, if you'll
follow me to the infirmary...

287
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,946
也许我应该跟着
如果你有什么问题的话
maybe I should tag along,
in case you have any questions..

288
00:17:17,987 --> 00:17:19,155
我想我已经搞定了, Rodney.
I think I've got a handle, Rodney.

289
00:17:19,197 --> 00:17:20,531
有很多系统你完全...
There are a lot of systems you know absolutely...

290
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:21,324
都了解了
Got it covered.

291
00:17:24,327 --> 00:17:24,869
好吧
Fine.

292
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:35,421
不要动
Hold still.

293
00:17:35,463 --> 00:17:37,215
只要一会儿
Just a minute more.

294
00:17:39,884 --> 00:17:44,180
好了, 亲爱的, 看起来里面的你跟外面一样可爱
Well, my dear, it seems you're just as
lovely on the inside as you are on the out.

295
00:17:44,222 --> 00:17:47,225
如果健康是美丽的同义词
If health is synonymous with beauty.

296
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:48,601
你可以起来了
You can get up now.

297
00:17:48,643 --> 00:17:50,436
这个设备是如何
How does this device

298
00:17:50,478 --> 00:17:51,980
按照你说的去做的?
do what you say it does?

299
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:57,902
它建立你身体内部组织的图像
它们都是非常完美的图像
It creates images of the tissues inside
your body, and they are picture-perfect.

300
00:17:57,944 --> 00:18:00,488
这些机器是从你们的星球上带来的么?
Did you bring these
machines back from your world?

301
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:01,406
有些是
Some.

302
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:05,076
其他的则是亚特兰蒂斯人的技术
我们只是知道怎么使用, 还有一些...
Others are atlantean technology that
we've figured out how to use, and a few...

303
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:09,038
嗯, 我甚至根本不知道它们是做什么的
well, I haven't the vaguest idea what they do.

304
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,040
希望某天我能够和他们当中的某个会会面
Hopefully one day I'll have a chance to meet one.

305
00:18:11,082 --> 00:18:11,916
我亲自去问问他们
I'll ask them myself.

306
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,251
你知道他们发生了什么?
Do you know what happened to them?

307
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:16,713
嗯, 在和幽灵的战争之后
有一些回到了地球
Well, some returned to Earth
after the war with the Wraith.

308
00:18:16,754 --> 00:18:19,924
这就是我们知道的了
不过我们还知道他们当中有些人升天了
That much we know, but we also
know that some of them ascended.

309
00:18:20,341 --> 00:18:21,426
升天?
Ascended?

310
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:24,429
进入一个更高的层次
在那里他们仅仅以能量的形式存在
To a higher plane,
where they exist only as energy.

311
00:18:25,722 --> 00:18:27,849
你那个星球中的所有人都跟你一样健康么?
Are all the people of
your world as healthy as you?

312
00:18:28,892 --> 00:18:29,642
是的
Yes.

313
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:32,103
没有疾病?
No disease, ailments?

314
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:35,273
从来没有人摔断腿?
No one ever breaks a leg?

315
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:37,984
这种事情很少
不过我的人民很快就会痊愈了
Such things are rare,
but my people heal quite rapidly.

316
00:18:38,192 --> 00:18:39,694
真的?
Really?

317
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:43,781
我们完了么?
Are we done?

318
00:18:44,574 --> 00:18:45,199
完了么?
Are we?

319
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:47,118
我见过的最健康的病人了
Healthiest patient I've ever had.

320
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,161
你可以走了, 亲爱的
Off you go, love.

321
00:18:53,917 --> 00:18:54,709
情况到底怎样?
Where are we at?

322
00:18:54,751 --> 00:18:56,753
好吧, 要么她知道武器在哪里
却故意在玩弄我们
Well, either she knows where
the weapon is and she's playing us,

323
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:59,881
要么她确实不知道
不管是哪种情况, 我们都在浪费时间
or else she has no idea,
in which case, we are wasting our time.

324
00:18:59,923 --> 00:19:01,007
那么你的建议是?
So what do you suggest?

325
00:19:01,049 --> 00:19:04,427
派另外一对人乘飞船过去
扫描那个行星上的能量信号
Take another team back in the jumper,
scan the planet for energy signatures.

326
00:19:04,469 --> 00:19:06,221
Chaya的人民不会察觉我们在轨道上所做的事情
Chaya's people won't have a
clue what we're doing from orbit,

327
00:19:06,262 --> 00:19:08,640
除非他们已经有了发达的科技
只是假装出来不是这样
unless they're a technically advanced
race that are pretending not to be,

328
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:10,850
这在以前也发生过
which has happened before.

329
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,186
你找到什么不正常的东西了么?
Did you find anything abnormal?

330
00:19:13,228 --> 00:19:15,855
我的意思是, 可以证明比他们声称的更发达的东西?
I mean, something that would suggest they
are more advanced than they claim to be?

331
00:19:15,897 --> 00:19:19,817
没有, 他们的技术要么是可怜的后进
要么就是超乎寻常的先进
No, They're either pathetically pretechnological
or brilliantly post-technological.

332
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:22,362
而且那肯定不会是一个自然现象?
And there's no way this
could be a natural phenomenon?

333
00:19:22,403 --> 00:19:25,615
非常恰当的时机, 非常合适的方向
那股能量爆发刚好只影响了幽灵的飞船
A perfectly timed, directional energy burst
that only affected the Wraith ships?

334
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:27,575
- 就是说不会是了?
- 不可能是
- That's a no?
- That's a no.

335
00:19:27,617 --> 00:19:29,994
Weir 博士,  我已经有了结果了
Dr. Weir,  I have those results.

336
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:31,579
谢谢你, Carson. 我们正过来
Thank you, Carson. We're on our way.

337
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,668
你们一共有多少人?
How many of you are there?

338
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:39,212
把所有在大陆的人都算在内
Counting all the athosians on the mainland,

339
00:19:39,462 --> 00:19:41,297
大概有两百人
you might get a couple of hundred,

340
00:19:41,339 --> 00:19:43,925
住在一个非常大, 而且空旷的城市中
which leaves a very large, empty city.

341
00:19:43,967 --> 00:19:46,678
现在, 我们只住在一个区域
因为我们的能量无法分散到更多的区域
Right now, we're living in one section, because we
don't have the power to spread out more than that.

342
00:19:50,848 --> 00:19:51,808
你认为这里怎么样?
What do you think so far?

343
00:19:53,476 --> 00:19:55,103
我想这非常令人惊奇
I think it's wondrous...

344
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,022
不过最终, 这都是 Athar 的结果
but ultimately, the decision is up to Athar.

345
00:20:00,817 --> 00:20:02,318
你并不是信徒, 是么?
You're not a believer, are you?

346
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:04,445
瞧, Chaya...
Look, Chaya...

347
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,906
我尊重你所信仰的
I respect that you believe.

348
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:10,493
瞧, 我无法同 Athar 对话
Look, I can't talk to Athar,

349
00:20:10,535 --> 00:20:14,914
我只能跟你谈谈, 我想问你
如果鞋穿在另一只脚上会怎么样呢?
I can only talk to you, so let me ask you this
what if the shoe was on the other foot?

350
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:17,542
如果是你的人民处于危难之中
而我们又可以提供帮助呢?
What if your people were in trouble
and we could help you?

351
00:20:18,501 --> 00:20:20,336
难道你也只是回答不么?
Would you just take no for an answer?

352
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:26,009
你们整日处于幽灵的阴影之下, 肯定活得非常艰难
It must have been very hard to live your
entire life under the shadow of the Wraith.

353
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:29,846
不要误解我的意思
Don't misunderstand me.

354
00:20:29,888 --> 00:20:32,015
Teyla 和她的人民很早就认识幽灵了
Teyla and her people have
known the Wraith forever,

355
00:20:32,056 --> 00:20:34,392
不过我们在这里是新人
我的意思是, 我们刚刚才到这里
but when I say we're new,
I mean we just got here.

356
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:36,686
我们是从另外一个星系来的
一个叫做地球的行星
We're from another galaxy.
A planet called Earth.

357
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:37,937
地球?
Earth?

358
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:39,731
非常遥远
It's very far away.

359
00:20:40,523 --> 00:20:42,567
知道那些你在夜空中看到的那些星团么?
You know those clusters of
stars you see in the night sky?

360
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:44,819
其中的某些被称作星系
Some of them are called galaxies,

361
00:20:44,861 --> 00:20:47,071
他们比这些星星离你更远
and they're even further
away from you than the stars.

362
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:49,365
地球就在其中的一个星系当中
Earth is in one of those galaxies.

363
00:20:49,407 --> 00:20:51,242
你们通过星际之门来到这里
You came through the Stargate.

364
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:52,410
对
That's right.

365
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:54,495
那你们为什么不能就那样回去?
And can you not simply return?

366
00:20:54,537 --> 00:20:56,080
好吧,  没那么简单
Well, not simply.

367
00:20:56,998 --> 00:20:59,834
我们跨进它就知道这可能是一个单程旅行
We knew going into it that it was
probably going to be a one-way trip,

368
00:20:59,876 --> 00:21:04,297
不过我们认为我们在这里所发现的值得去冒那个险
but we thought what we would
find here would be worth the risk.

369
00:21:04,339 --> 00:21:05,632
是这样么?
And is it?

370
00:21:05,715 --> 00:21:06,966
目前为止是
So far.

371
00:21:07,008 --> 00:21:09,052
等到幽灵出现的时候再问我吧
Ask me again when the Wraith show up.

372
00:21:09,552 --> 00:21:13,431
血液检查显示没有病毒, 细菌以及寄生虫感染
Blood work shows no viral,
bacterial, or parasitic infections.

373
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:19,479
核磁共振显示没有肿瘤和癌症
没有任何类型的心脏疾病
Mri reveals no tumors or cancers,
no heart defects of any kind.

374
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:25,360
血压130  70,
胆固醇 107.
Blood pressure 130 over 70,
total cholesterol 107.

375
00:21:25,401 --> 00:21:27,487
她非常健康
She's in perfect health.

376
00:21:27,946 --> 00:21:29,322
我为她感到高兴
I'm happy for her.

377
00:21:29,364 --> 00:21:31,491
你为什么让我们看这些?
Why did we need to see this?

378
00:21:31,532 --> 00:21:33,243
因为, 博士
她实在是太健康了
Because, doctor,
she's too healthy.

379
00:21:33,284 --> 00:21:34,327
这是什么意思?
What does that mean?

380
00:21:34,369 --> 00:21:37,205
没有任何疾病以及先天不足的迹象
There's no trace of any
diseases or congenital conditions

381
00:21:37,247 --> 00:21:39,749
而那在她们哪种技术水平的社会应该很常见
that you typically find in
pretechnological societies.

382
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,627
没有佝偻病, 没有真菌...
No rickets, no fungi, stds...

383
00:21:43,336 --> 00:21:44,462
完美的健康?
perfect health?

384
00:21:44,504 --> 00:21:49,133
是的, 根据她所告诉我的
这在她的人民当中非常平常
Aye, and from what she told me,
this may be the norm among her people.

385
00:21:49,175 --> 00:21:50,218
但是她是人类?
But she is human?

386
00:21:50,301 --> 00:21:51,302
噢, 毫无疑问
Oh, without a doubt.

387
00:21:51,344 --> 00:21:52,345
那么这又怎么可能?
So how is that possible?

388
00:21:52,929 --> 00:21:56,099
我也无法解释
除非我亲自去那个星球看看
I can't say that for certain
without visiting the planet myself,

389
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:59,060
如果这些数据是准确的
那么居住在Proculis的人民
but if this data is accurate,
then people on Proculis

390
00:22:00,103 --> 00:22:03,064
可以健康的生活很长很长的时间
live in optimal health for a
very, very long time.

391
00:22:03,106 --> 00:22:05,483
- 你让这听起来好像是...
- 天堂?
- You make it sound like some sort of a...
- paradise?

392
00:22:05,525 --> 00:22:07,110
是的, 因为它就是
Aye, because it is.

393
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,821
这就是问题, 因为...
And that's a problem because...

394
00:22:09,862 --> 00:22:16,077
因为人类的生命, 非常简单
 Weir博士, 比这要脆弱得多
because human life, quite simply,
dr. Weir, is more fragile than that.

395
00:22:16,953 --> 00:22:18,538
我不管我们是在那个星系
I don't care what galaxy we're in.

396
00:22:19,122 --> 00:22:20,373
这是不自然的
It's unnatural.

397
00:22:27,881 --> 00:22:30,091
海上上的空气真是令人爽快啊
The ocean air is so invigorating.

398
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:31,676
这里多的是
Plenty of that here.

399
00:22:32,886 --> 00:22:34,637
大多数行星的海洋
Most of the planet's ocean.

400
00:22:36,222 --> 00:22:38,850
确实有足够的陆地来安顿那些难民么
Well surely there's enough
land to resettle the refugees.

401
00:22:38,892 --> 00:22:39,893
当然
Well, there is.

402
00:22:39,934 --> 00:22:42,145
我们只是不能保证他们的安全
We just can't guarantee their safety.

403
00:22:42,186 --> 00:22:44,314
即使你们可以控制所有这些?
Even though you control all of this?

404
00:22:44,355 --> 00:22:47,901
如果我说过我们可以控制所有这些, 那么我是在撒谎
I'd be lying if I said we controlled it all.

405
00:22:48,818 --> 00:22:52,113
这个地方在很多方面超越了我们的能力
This place is so far beyond us in so many ways.

406
00:22:52,322 --> 00:22:55,366
比如, 亚特兰蒂斯有一个可以抵挡任何东西的防护罩
For example, Atlantis does have a
shield that can withstand anything

407
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:58,453
可以把幽灵抵挡在外
不过我们没有办法给它提供能量
the Wraith could throw at us,
but we have no way of powering it up.

408
00:22:59,662 --> 00:23:02,582
这里已经有太多的难民了
我们不能冒险接收更多
We can't risk taking in any
more refugees than we already have.

409
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:06,502
跟我来
Come with me.

410
00:23:09,589 --> 00:23:10,715
Sheppard 少校...
Major Sheppard...

411
00:23:10,757 --> 00:23:12,175
我更愿意你叫我John.
I'd prefer you call me John.

412
00:23:13,009 --> 00:23:13,801
John...
John...

413
00:23:14,427 --> 00:23:16,179
你们又是怎么跟幽灵结仇的呢?
how did you make enemies of the Wraith?

414
00:23:16,221 --> 00:23:18,014
那都是我的错
That was my fault.

415
00:23:18,056 --> 00:23:19,057
你的错?
Yours?

416
00:23:19,098 --> 00:23:22,560
我在试图拯救那些他们抓去的人时
把它们给唤醒了
I basically woke them up trying to
rescue some people they'd captured.

417
00:23:22,602 --> 00:23:24,145
它们对那一点也不友好
They didn't take too kindly to that.

418
00:23:24,187 --> 00:23:26,022
但是你救出了你的人?
But you saved your people?

419
00:23:27,523 --> 00:23:28,274
大部分
Most of them.

420
00:23:28,775 --> 00:23:30,902
你怎么确信他们一定会回来?
And that is how you know
for sure they're coming back?

421
00:23:31,277 --> 00:23:33,196
是的, 不过我们当时并不知道
Yeah, we just don't know when.

422
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:41,704
主控制台, 环境支持系统, 通信系统
Main control console, environmental
support systems, communications,

423
00:23:42,038 --> 00:23:45,917
还有这个, 这是, 嗯...
and this, this is, uh...

424
00:23:48,169 --> 00:23:50,755
抱歉, 少校
我们还完全不知道这是...
Sorry, Major.
We haven't the faintest idea what it...

425
00:23:53,508 --> 00:23:57,512
这是我们在城市另外一个区域找到的设备
this is a new piece of equipment
we found in another section of the city.

426
00:23:57,554 --> 00:23:59,180
它还没有被初始化过
It hadn't yet been initialized.

427
00:23:59,222 --> 00:24:00,515
那么你说她拥有...
So you're saying she has...

428
00:24:00,557 --> 00:24:01,724
她拥有那个基金
she has the gene.

429
00:24:02,308 --> 00:24:03,518
这是我干的么?
Then I did this?

430
00:24:04,227 --> 00:24:05,645
这个机器是做什么的?
What does the machine do?

431
00:24:05,687 --> 00:24:07,564
无论如何, 现在, 我们还不知道,
We don't know. Not yet, anyway.

432
00:24:07,605 --> 00:24:09,357
亚特兰蒂斯人做这些东西确实非常出色
The Atlanteans were good at lots of things,

433
00:24:09,732 --> 00:24:12,318
不过写说明书除外
but writing instruction
manuals wasn't one of them.

434
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:15,280
我们可能需要结束参观了
We should probably wrap this tour up.

435
00:24:16,739 --> 00:24:19,868
我知道Weir博士现在肯定很想见到你
I know dr. Weir is anxious to talk to you.

436
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:21,828
在那以后我还能看到你么?
Will I see you afterwards?

437
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:23,037
你会一直看到我
And during.

438
00:24:27,876 --> 00:24:30,503
我们所建议的是你们能否出租一些土地
What we are proposing
is a kind of land lease,

439
00:24:30,545 --> 00:24:32,505
这样受到幽灵袭击
in which refugees rendered homeless

440
00:24:32,547 --> 00:24:34,424
而无家可归的人们
就可以在Proculis重新安顿了
by the Wraith could resettle on Proculis.

441
00:24:35,174 --> 00:24:37,176
作为回报, 我们会提供服务和知识
In return, we can offer
you services and knowledge

442
00:24:37,218 --> 00:24:38,553
这些可以帮助你的人民
which would be of benefit to your people.

443
00:24:38,595 --> 00:24:39,387
例如?
Such as?

444
00:24:39,429 --> 00:24:42,098
好吧, 你已经看到了我们这里所拥有的技术
Well, you've seen the sort
of technology we possess here.

445
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:45,435
我们可以帮助你们步入一个更加工业化的社会
We could help you down a path
to a more industrialized society,

446
00:24:45,476 --> 00:24:48,730
而且这样的发展步伐仍然会保持
你那个星球的生态平行
but at a pace that will maintain
your planet's ecological balance.

447
00:24:48,771 --> 00:24:53,818
你的科学知识非常打动人
 Weir 博士, 不过我们并不需要它
Your scientific knowledge is impressive,
dr. Weir, but we have no need of it.

448
00:24:54,027 --> 00:24:56,321
Athar 已经提供给我们所有我们想要的了
Athar provides us with everything we require.

449
00:24:56,362 --> 00:24:59,490
嗯, 食物并不会自动在餐桌上出现
Well, food just doesn't
show up on the dinner table.

450
00:24:59,532 --> 00:25:01,659
你们的庄稼都是靠你们自己种出来的?
You do plant all your own crops?

451
00:25:02,202 --> 00:25:02,952
是的, 当然
Of course we do.

452
00:25:02,994 --> 00:25:05,079
我们可以教你们一些方法来提高你们作物的产量
We can show you ways
to increase your crop yields.

453
00:25:05,121 --> 00:25:07,248
我们种的食物已经足够我们生存了
We grow all the food we need to live.

454
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:08,875
再多一点就是暴食了
Anything else would be gluttony.

455
00:25:10,251 --> 00:25:11,461
那么, 建筑材料
Building materials, then.

456
00:25:11,502 --> 00:25:14,631
我们已经有非常充裕的木料和铁矿石了
We have abundant timber and iron ore
to forge what little metal we need.

457
00:25:15,548 --> 00:25:16,674
Athar 实在是太仁慈了
Athar is kind.

458
00:25:21,262 --> 00:25:22,513
一定会有什么的
There must be something.

459
00:25:23,723 --> 00:25:27,143
我的人民人为价值最高的是精神上的知识
What my people value
most is spiritual knowledge.

460
00:25:27,185 --> 00:25:29,604
你们的文明可以在那方面回报些什么?
What can your culture provide in that regard?

461
00:25:32,649 --> 00:25:36,444
地球上的人们不会分享
单一的精神信仰
Earth's people don't share
a single spiritual belief.

462
00:25:37,028 --> 00:25:40,907
我们包含了很多信仰和哲学
We embrace a number of
different religions and philosophies...

463
00:25:41,074 --> 00:25:42,867
基督教, 佛教
Christianity, Buddhism,

464
00:25:42,909 --> 00:25:44,702
犹太教, 伊斯兰教...
Judaism, Islam...

465
00:25:45,995 --> 00:25:46,829
印度教
Hinduism.

466
00:25:48,081 --> 00:25:49,332
Kwanzaa...
Kwanzaa...

467
00:25:49,749 --> 00:25:50,875
有意思
Interesting.

468
00:25:50,917 --> 00:25:52,210
跟我讲讲它们
Tell me about them.

469
00:25:52,252 --> 00:25:53,336
所有的?
All of them?

470
00:25:53,378 --> 00:25:54,462
是的, 它们听起来非常迷人
Yes. They sound fascinating.

471
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:58,883
好吧,  我还没有能力来讨论
地球上所有的宗教
Well, I am hardly competent
to discuss all of Earth's religions,

472
00:25:58,925 --> 00:26:00,802
不过我可以提供给你一些资源
but I can offer you some resources.

473
00:26:00,843 --> 00:26:04,180
通过很简单的训练
你就可以完全访问我们的历史数据库了
With very little training, you could have
complete access to our historical database.

474
00:26:05,181 --> 00:26:06,933
那太好了
That would be wonderful.

475
00:26:10,562 --> 00:26:11,229
你让它工作起来了?
You got it working?

476
00:26:11,271 --> 00:26:12,105
是的
Yeah.

477
00:26:13,273 --> 00:26:14,440
那好, 我们知道它是做什么的么?
Well, do we know what it does?

478
00:26:14,816 --> 00:26:18,027
它看起来好像是一个内外生物传感器阵列
It would appear to be an
internal-external biometric sensor array.

479
00:26:18,069 --> 00:26:20,446
哦, 现在, sadly, 我明白了
See, now, sadly, I understood that.

480
00:26:21,447 --> 00:26:22,907
他们星期六晚上到哪里去了?
Where did all those saturday nights go?

481
00:26:22,949 --> 00:26:25,618
这些看起来像是亚特兰蒂斯中
所有人的生物标识
These seem to be the
biosignatures of everyone in Atlantis.

482
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:28,121
你怎么知道?
我从这些杂乱无章的东西中完全找不出头绪
How can you tell? I can't make
heads or tails out of that mess.

483
00:26:28,162 --> 00:26:30,665
我以前的工作是解码古人的对数
I've been working on
deciphering the ancient logarithms.

484
00:26:30,707 --> 00:26:33,835
我想这个是设计用来作为早期预警系统的
I suspect this was designed
primarily as an early warning system,

485
00:26:33,877 --> 00:26:35,587
假如有异族侵入, 就像幽灵, 就发出信号
to signal any alien presence
in the city, like the Wraith.

486
00:26:35,628 --> 00:26:40,049
你刚才说当我们的访问者
触摸到它的时候, 它就被激活了?
And you're saying that it
activated when our visitor touched it?

487
00:26:40,091 --> 00:26:41,551
这表示她一定有古人的基因
Which must mean she has the ancient gene.

488
00:26:41,593 --> 00:26:44,929
或者它已经被初始化过了
然后只要检测到她就会被激活
Or it was initialized already and only
activated because it was detecting her.

489
00:26:44,971 --> 00:26:47,140
我的意思是,  它可能是某种异族
I mean, she could be some kind of an alien,

490
00:26:47,181 --> 00:26:49,350
这个东西相对我们所能破译的
了解她更多
and this thing knows more about
her than we've been able to decipher.

491
00:26:50,643 --> 00:26:52,270
必须有人去盯住她
Someone should be keeping an eye on her.

492
00:26:52,312 --> 00:26:53,396
有 Sheppard 少校在
Major Sheppard is.

493
00:26:53,438 --> 00:26:54,731
哦, 我想是的
Oh, I'm sure he is.

494
00:26:54,772 --> 00:26:56,566
不过不完全是你所想的原因
Not entirely for the reasons you think.

495
00:26:56,608 --> 00:26:57,817
Weir 博士要求他这么做
Dr. Weir asked him to.

496
00:26:58,234 --> 00:26:59,360
哦, 我想他一定会的
Oh, I'm sure she did.

497
00:27:06,284 --> 00:27:08,036
Weir 博士希望我
确保让Chaya 看到一切
Dr. Weir wanted me to make
sure Chaya saw everything.

498
00:27:08,077 --> 00:27:08,828
一切?
Everything?

499
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:10,496
嗯, 不是一切, 一切
Well, not everything, everything.

500
00:27:10,538 --> 00:27:13,666
Chaya 提到她想看到城市夜晚最美丽的景色
Chaya mentioned she wanted to
see the best view of the city at night,

501
00:27:13,708 --> 00:27:18,004
我想应该是在西南塔的顶上
不过考虑到有一段很长的路要走
which I think is atop the southwest pier,
and since it's such a long walk,

502
00:27:18,046 --> 00:27:20,757
我想我应该带上一些食品
I thought I'd bring along a few provisions.

503
00:27:21,841 --> 00:27:24,135
继续我们谈判的努力
Continuing our efforts to secure a treaty.

504
00:27:24,177 --> 00:27:25,220
很对
Exactly.

505
00:27:25,595 --> 00:27:27,096
作为我们的外交官
As our ambassador.

506
00:27:30,183 --> 00:27:33,519
我是外交官, 那么她就是...
I am an ambassador, and she is a...

507
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:34,812
大使
diplomat.

508
00:27:35,897 --> 00:27:39,234
在深夜...野餐上?
On a late-night...picnic?

509
00:27:39,984 --> 00:27:40,818
是的
Yes.

510
00:27:42,612 --> 00:27:45,949
我知道那是作为亚特兰蒂斯的最高军事指挥官
I know that as ranking
military officer here in Atlantis

511
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:48,493
而且你感觉担负的责任很重
that you feel a heavy burden of responsibility,

512
00:27:49,035 --> 00:27:49,994
不过你...
but you...

513
00:27:50,036 --> 00:27:52,664
也要考虑一下别人是怎么想的
are allowed to have feelings for others.

514
00:27:52,705 --> 00:27:54,415
噢.  不, 这只是...
Oh. No, this is a...

515
00:27:54,457 --> 00:27:59,003
这只是一个大使级的外交上的野餐
this is an ambassadorial,
diplomatic picnic outing.

516
00:27:59,045 --> 00:27:59,837
除了...
Without...

517
00:27:59,879 --> 00:28:02,507
不必在每个人面前证明他们自己的身份
having to justify them to anyone.

518
00:28:04,008 --> 00:28:05,176
晚安, 少校
Good night, Major.

519
00:28:08,304 --> 00:28:10,348
晚安, Teyla.
Good night, Teyla.

520
00:28:14,811 --> 00:28:16,145
你要把她送回去?
You want to send her back?

521
00:28:16,187 --> 00:28:18,731
我所知道的全部就是
现在的她是假装出来的, 并不是真正的她
All I know is she's not who
she's pretending to be.

522
00:28:18,773 --> 00:28:19,816
你知道这因为...
And you know this because...

523
00:28:19,857 --> 00:28:21,025
怎么, 我就不能有直觉了?
what, I'm not allowed to have intuition?

524
00:28:21,067 --> 00:28:22,110
你? 不
You? No.

525
00:28:23,444 --> 00:28:24,946
我已经让Sheppard少校注意她了
I asked Major Sheppard
to keep an eye on her.

526
00:28:24,988 --> 00:28:28,324
这就好像是让狐狸去看家
Which is like asking the
fox to guard the henhouse.

527
00:28:28,366 --> 00:28:29,117
什么?
What?

528
00:28:29,158 --> 00:28:32,662
好吧, 你看, 生物学上的区别不是非常显著, Elizabeth.
Well, look, the biometric
differential is not insignificant, Elizabeth.

529
00:28:33,663 --> 00:28:34,998
我想说的是...
What I'm saying is...

530
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,791
那个女人引起了异族警报
the woman set off an alien alarm.

531
00:28:36,833 --> 00:28:39,002
噢, 这个你也不是很确信
Come on, you don't know that for certain.

532
00:28:39,043 --> 00:28:43,172
现在, grodin 说你也不知道
那个设备的工作机制
Now, grodin says you are nowhere close to
understanding what the nature of that device is.

533
00:28:43,214 --> 00:28:46,509
有太多的未知变数
那里有能量武器
There are too many unknown variables.
There's the energy weapon,

534
00:28:46,551 --> 00:28:47,719
他们声称从来没有见过幽灵...
the fact that they claim never
to have seen the Wraith...

535
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,179
还有她那完全合乎规范的健康
what about the fact that she's
essentially a textbook case of healthy?

536
00:28:50,221 --> 00:28:52,682
是的, 这都很神秘
不过这又能证明什么呢?
All very mysterious, yes,
but what does it prove?

537
00:28:52,724 --> 00:28:55,351
那就是我们要给她一张单程票, 让她回家
That we should give her
a one-way ticket back home.

538
00:28:55,393 --> 00:28:57,478
看起来她身上确实有些事情非常...
There is obviously something very...

539
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,441
与众不同, 是的, 不过这些都不足以证明
她是一个有威胁的人物
different about her, yes, but that
doesn't necessarily make her a threat.

540
00:29:01,482 --> 00:29:03,318
这同时也不合常理
It doesn't rule it out, either.

541
00:29:03,693 --> 00:29:05,778
那么, 目前,  我想我们通过谈判可以获得的
Then, for the moment,
I think what we could gain

542
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:08,615
已经值得冒险让她留在这里
by securing a treaty is worth
the risk of her being here.

543
00:29:09,908 --> 00:29:10,783
好吧
Fine.

544
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,291
这个味道好极了
This is delicious.

545
00:29:19,626 --> 00:29:22,670
嗯, 尽情享受吧
因为那是我们的最后一个了
Well, enjoy it while you can,
because that's the last of what we have.

546
00:29:22,712 --> 00:29:24,422
那我真是太荣幸了
Then I am honored.

547
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:28,509
要是 McKay 发现了, 他会杀了我的
When McKay finds out,
he's going to kill me.

548
00:29:28,551 --> 00:29:30,053
Athar 会拯救你的
Athar will save you.

549
00:29:30,094 --> 00:29:31,429
噢, 好啊
Oh, good.

550
00:29:34,057 --> 00:29:35,475
如此令人惊奇的东西
Such wondrous things.

551
00:29:36,226 --> 00:29:39,812
这么多种食物, 除了不停的吃
我再也想不起去做别的事情了
I can't imagine wanting to do anything but
eat all the time with such a variety of foods.

552
00:29:40,396 --> 00:29:43,149
好吧, 那就让我们尽情地投入吧
Well, we manage to pull
ourselves away somehow.

553
00:29:44,025 --> 00:29:45,652
我已经知道了很多关于地球的事情
I've been learning much about Earth.

554
00:29:45,818 --> 00:29:48,529
Weir 博士已经带我去见识你的信息机器了
Dr. Weir has gotten me
on your information machines.

555
00:29:48,821 --> 00:29:51,991
Elizabeth已经让你去操作计算机了, 嗯?
Elizabeth's got you on
a computer already, huh?

556
00:29:52,492 --> 00:29:54,202
我为你们那么多的宗教而着迷
I'm fascinated by your many religions.

557
00:29:54,661 --> 00:29:55,912
如此多的信仰
So many beliefs.

558
00:29:56,246 --> 00:29:57,580
如此多的哲学
So many philosophies.

559
00:29:57,997 --> 00:29:59,374
是的, 我们接受其中的某些
Yeah, we've got a few of those.

560
00:29:59,666 --> 00:30:01,292
同时还有很多反对的信仰
So many contradictory faiths.

561
00:30:02,001 --> 00:30:03,294
是的, 这有点混乱
Yeah, it's a bit of a mess.

562
00:30:06,381 --> 00:30:07,215
再来一点?
More?

563
00:30:08,049 --> 00:30:08,925
好的
Yes, please.

564
00:30:10,134 --> 00:30:12,262
我们通过贸易交换葡萄
We traded for grapes.

565
00:30:13,221 --> 00:30:15,974
那些athosians人, Teyla的人民
The athosians, Teyla's people,

566
00:30:16,015 --> 00:30:17,600
他们在大陆种植这些
they make this on the mainland.

567
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:22,855
我对你说的有些话不是完全诚实的
I wasn't completely truthful
with you about something.

568
00:30:26,025 --> 00:30:28,861
在Proculis, 当我告诉你我从未感觉到孤独的时候...
On Proculis, when I told
you I did not feel lonely...

569
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:33,241
来到这里, 跟你在一起...
coming here and being with you...

570
00:30:34,617 --> 00:30:37,328
提醒我, 不再孤单的感觉是什么样的
it reminded me what it
was like not to be alone.

571
00:30:45,086 --> 00:30:45,795
什么?
What?

572
00:30:45,837 --> 00:30:47,589
呵呵, 我的意思是, 没有什么
Well, I mean, nothing.

573
00:30:48,131 --> 00:30:49,340
只是...
It's just that...

574
00:30:49,382 --> 00:30:55,346
这是我第一次在外星球和一个女人
如此的罗曼蒂克
this is the first time I've been in a romantic
situation with a woman from another planet,

575
00:30:55,388 --> 00:30:56,848
这让我觉得有点...
and it just strikes me as really,...

576
00:30:57,891 --> 00:30:58,641
不好?
wrong?

577
00:30:58,683 --> 00:30:59,851
不. 天哪, 不是
No. God, no.

578
00:30:59,893 --> 00:31:01,102
只是... 只是...
Just... just...

579
00:31:01,144 --> 00:31:02,312
好笑
funny.

580
00:31:03,897 --> 00:31:04,772
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

581
00:31:04,814 --> 00:31:05,565
我只是在想
I just thought

582
00:31:05,607 --> 00:31:06,441
我要, 嗯...
that I would, uh...

583
00:31:07,734 --> 00:31:08,735
你自己说的...
you said it yourself...

584
00:31:08,776 --> 00:31:09,903
我们都是人类
we're both human.

585
00:31:10,987 --> 00:31:17,869
是的, 我们是的, 我非常高兴你
没有说"家人", 要不然我就得离开了
Yes, we are, and I'm really glad you
didn't say "family" otherwise I'd have to leave.

586
00:31:20,163 --> 00:31:20,914
不要
Don't.

587
00:31:27,337 --> 00:31:28,796
我哪也不去
I'm not going anywhere.

588
00:31:47,982 --> 00:31:48,775
少校
Major.

589
00:31:49,776 --> 00:31:50,568
Rodney.
Rodney.

590
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:51,778
在做什么, 搞得这么晚 ?
What are you doing up so late?

591
00:31:51,819 --> 00:31:53,529
我只是, 嗯...
I was just, uh...

592
00:31:53,571 --> 00:31:55,949
我睡不着, 所以我回到
控制室做点小研究
I couldn't sleep, so I was going back up
to the control room to do a little research.

593
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:56,824
你呢?
What about you?

594
00:31:56,908 --> 00:31:57,700
哦, 不, 谢谢了
Oh, no thanks.

595
00:31:57,742 --> 00:32:00,245
不, 我的意思是, 你做什么搞得这么晚?
No, I mean, what were you doing up so late?

596
00:32:00,286 --> 00:32:01,079
我总是搞得很晚, rodney.
I'm always up late, rodney.

597
00:32:02,205 --> 00:32:03,414
一点警告...
A word of caution...

598
00:32:03,456 --> 00:32:09,420
kirk上尉的例行公事般的回答很有问题
言语简短, 更不用说精神上的疑点了
the whole captain kirk routine is problematic,
to say the least, let alone morally dubious.

599
00:32:09,462 --> 00:32:10,380
什么例行公事?
What routine?

600
00:32:10,421 --> 00:32:11,756
罗曼史, 外来的女祭司
The romancing, the alien priestess.

601
00:32:11,798 --> 00:32:13,341
你真是像是回到了1967年
It's very 1967 of you.

602
00:32:13,383 --> 00:32:14,133
事实上, 我很奇怪...
Actually, I'm surprised...

603
00:32:14,175 --> 00:32:17,220
我做的这些跟你有什么关系...
if and when anything I do
becomes your business...

604
00:32:17,262 --> 00:32:21,474
这跟我有关, 少校,  当那个外来的女人
并不像她自己所讲述的那样时
it becomes my business, major, when an alien
woman who is clearly not who she claims to be

605
00:32:21,516 --> 00:32:24,352
我们的最高指挥官却在抱着她的小指
has the ranking military officer
wrapped around her little finger.

606
00:32:24,394 --> 00:32:25,395
不要讲这些, McKay.
Don't go there, McKay.

607
00:32:25,937 --> 00:32:26,646
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

608
00:32:26,688 --> 00:32:29,774
我知道我平常不是很敏感
I know I'm not normally
mr. Sensitive, but you've got to

609
00:32:29,816 --> 00:32:31,693
不过在我讲某些确实跟她有关的事情时
我希望你能够相信我
believe me when I say
there is something about her.

610
00:32:31,734 --> 00:32:33,361
我知道这是不可捉摸的, 不过我可以感觉得到...
I know it's intangible, but I can feel it...

611
00:32:33,403 --> 00:32:35,154
我说了, 不要讲了
I said, don't go there.

612
00:32:35,196 --> 00:32:38,866
这只是时间的问题
我会证明给你看的, 少校
It's just a matter of time
before I prove it, Major.

613
00:32:38,908 --> 00:32:41,494
我只是建议在同时, 你管好你的...
I'm just recommending that in
the meantime, you keep your...

614
00:33:00,763 --> 00:33:01,806
你昨晚睡着了么?
did you sleep last night?

615
00:33:01,848 --> 00:33:04,601
没有. 生物传感器有一些数据
No. This is the data
from the biometric sensors.

616
00:33:04,726 --> 00:33:09,272
我不能说出所有这些信号所代表的意思
不过, 嗯, 看看这个
I can't tell you exactly what all of
these signatures mean, but, uh, look at this,

617
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,941
这是我们, 还有这, 这是她
these are ours, and this, this is hers.

618
00:33:11,983 --> 00:33:13,401
有很大的不同
There's a distinct difference.

619
00:33:13,443 --> 00:33:16,571
她出生在另外一个星系的另外一个星球
She was born on another
planet in another galaxy.

620
00:33:16,613 --> 00:33:18,197
它们跟Teyla 的也不同
They're different from Teyla's too.

621
00:33:18,239 --> 00:33:18,948
这并不意味着...
That doesn't mean...

622
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:21,075
Elizabeth, 她跟看起来得不一样.
Elizabeth, she's not
what she seems to be.

623
00:33:21,117 --> 00:33:24,454
除了她是一个非常诚实正直的人
我再也感觉不到什么其他的
I sense nothing but a very
honest and spiritual person.

624
00:33:24,495 --> 00:33:25,455
好吧
All right.

625
00:33:25,496 --> 00:33:27,790
有一个方法可以检查出来
there may be a way to find out.

626
00:33:27,832 --> 00:33:29,834
你们今早要跟她进行谈判, 对么?
You're opening negotiations
with her this morning, right?

627
00:33:29,876 --> 00:33:30,793
是的
Yeah.

628
00:33:30,835 --> 00:33:31,669
好吧, 这样, 让我坐在里面
Okay, well, let me sit in.

629
00:33:31,711 --> 00:33:33,922
我会假装是在本本上记笔记
实际上我会扫描她, 检测看是否有异常
I'll pretend to be taking notes on the laptop
when really I'll be scanning her for anomalies.

630
00:33:33,963 --> 00:33:37,258
放射线, E.M. 扫描, 能量信号...
Radiation, E.M. Scans, energy signatures...

631
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:41,012
这种方法, 除非我疯了, 只能让你我两个人知道
that way, if I am crazy, you and I
are the only ones who need to know.

632
00:33:41,054 --> 00:33:42,096
现在, 这样做有什么坏处么?
Now, what's the harm?

633
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,848
好吧...
All right...

634
00:33:44,515 --> 00:33:46,142
不过一定要小心
but be discreet.

635
00:33:46,184 --> 00:33:47,769
我就是"小心"先生
I'm mr. Discreet.

636
00:33:51,231 --> 00:33:54,567
我同意我所读过的地球上的宗教打动了我
I admit to being impressed by most
of what I've read of Earth's religions.

637
00:33:54,609 --> 00:33:57,320
The torah (《圣经·旧约全书》开头五篇),
the koran ( 伊斯兰教 《古兰经》),
the talmud ( 犹太教法典古代拉比著作的合集
包括《密西拿》和《革马拉》),
the bible...
The torah, the koran,
the talmud, the bible...

638
00:33:58,571 --> 00:34:01,991
它们当中的大多数展示了多种多样的
以及深切的对神的追求
most of them reveal a diverse
and deep desire to grasp the divine.

639
00:34:02,033 --> 00:34:04,202
这么说我们确实有一些可以提供给你们的东西了
So we do have something we can offer you.

640
00:34:04,577 --> 00:34:06,329
不过我同时也读过你们的历史
But I've also been reading about your history.

641
00:34:06,371 --> 00:34:10,583
即便是现在, 在你们的星球上
仍然有战争
Even now, somewhere on
your planet, you are at war.

642
00:34:10,625 --> 00:34:12,585
嗯, 是的, 这是真的
Well, yeah, that's true.

643
00:34:12,627 --> 00:34:15,088
我并没有想向你掩饰这些真相
I made no attempt to
hide that fact from you.

644
00:34:15,588 --> 00:34:17,590
Chaya, 我们并不是完美的
Chaya, we are definitely not perfect.

645
00:34:17,924 --> 00:34:20,510
作为人类, 我发现你们有太多的困扰了
There's a lot about you as
a people that I find disturbing.

646
00:34:20,552 --> 00:34:22,595
难道其他人不是这样?
Can that not be said of any people?

647
00:34:22,637 --> 00:34:23,304
不是
No.

648
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:27,058
Proculis 中的每一个灵魂都可以远离憎恨和愤怒
Every soul in Proculis is free
from the hatred and the anger

649
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,018
而地球上的人们彼此之间却经常这样
the people from Earth
seem to feel for each other.

650
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:29,769
噢
Come on.

651
00:34:29,811 --> 00:34:30,812
我们没有那么糟糕
We're not all that bad.

652
00:34:30,853 --> 00:34:31,437
你是知道的
You know that.

653
00:34:31,479 --> 00:34:32,689
我知道
I do.

654
00:34:33,356 --> 00:34:35,275
我们并没有谈论地球上的人们
We're not talking about
the people on Earth.

655
00:34:35,316 --> 00:34:39,737
我是在谈论我的探险队的每个成员
在这里, 亚特兰蒂斯
I'm talking about every member
of my expedition team here, in Atlantis,

656
00:34:39,779 --> 00:34:43,533
以及自从我们到这里之后碰到的朋友
就像, Teyla的人民
and I'm talking about the friends we've
met since coming here, like Teyla's people.

657
00:34:44,993 --> 00:34:47,579
那也包括你, 你自己也包括在内, Weir 博士
There are some among you,
yourself included, Dr. Weir

658
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,747
我知道 Athar 会张开双臂欢迎...
that I know Athar would
welcome with open arms...

659
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,166
不过是其他人
but there are others.

660
00:34:53,293 --> 00:34:55,795
我已经挑选了这个探险队中的每个人
I hand-picked every
member of this expedition,

661
00:34:55,837 --> 00:34:59,215
我知道 Teyla 对她自己的人民很有信心
and I know Teyla feels as
confident about her own people.

662
00:35:00,425 --> 00:35:01,384
我知道
I'm sure.

663
00:35:01,426 --> 00:35:04,095
在今天结束之前
这只是一个信任的问题
At the end of the day,
this is a matter of trust.

664
00:35:04,345 --> 00:35:05,221
是的
Yes.

665
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,765
是这样,  Weir 博士
It is, dr. Weir.

666
00:35:08,766 --> 00:35:12,103
你扫描到一些东西没有,  McKay博士?
Have your scans found
anything yet, Dr. McKay?

667
00:35:17,775 --> 00:35:19,110
事实上...
Actually...

668
00:35:21,237 --> 00:35:22,071
没有
no.

669
00:35:23,323 --> 00:35:24,657
这到底是什么?
What the hell is this?

670
00:35:24,699 --> 00:35:25,909
我很抱歉, 少校
I'm sorry, Major.

671
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:28,536
我们有理由调查清楚...
There was cause for
legitimate concern as to...

672
00:35:28,578 --> 00:35:30,496
我跟我声称的是否相同
whether I was or not who I claimed to be.

673
00:35:31,247 --> 00:35:32,207
我很抱歉, Chaya.
I'm sorry, Chaya.

674
00:35:32,248 --> 00:35:34,167
我真诚地希望这没有伤害你
I honestly felt it would do no harm.

675
00:35:34,209 --> 00:35:36,211
不要道歉了, Elizabeth.
Stop apologizing, Elizabeth.

676
00:35:36,669 --> 00:35:37,629
她是怎么知道的?
How did she know?

677
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:38,463
McKay...
McKay...

678
00:35:38,504 --> 00:35:40,423
她是一个古人, 少校.
she's an ancient, Major.

679
00:35:40,465 --> 00:35:41,257
她是什么?
She's what?

680
00:35:41,841 --> 00:35:42,717
我是对的, 是么?
I'm right, aren't I?

681
00:35:43,259 --> 00:35:44,844
完美的健康, 那个能量武器
The perfect health, the energy weapon,

682
00:35:44,886 --> 00:35:45,845
她所具有的基因...
the fact that she has the gene...

683
00:35:45,887 --> 00:35:48,348
在逻辑上只有一个解释
it's the only logical explanation.

684
00:35:48,389 --> 00:35:50,808
你到底在说些什么?
What the hell are you talking about?

685
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:52,602
我只是不明白这种行为
I just don't understand the act.

686
00:35:52,644 --> 00:35:57,065
我的意思是, 你要知道我们实在不惜一切代价的
同你们交谈, 向你们学习
I mean, you must know we'd give just about
anything to talk to you, to learn from you.

687
00:35:57,982 --> 00:35:58,816
我的意思是, 到底是什么?
I mean, what is it?

688
00:35:58,858 --> 00:36:01,527
你要... 检查我们什么?
What, are you... checking us out?

689
00:36:02,195 --> 00:36:04,530
我渴望来到亚特兰蒂斯
I see that in my desire to come to Atlantis,

690
00:36:04,572 --> 00:36:06,241
你们已经把我揭示得太多了
I have revealed too much of myself.

691
00:36:06,282 --> 00:36:07,283
他是对的?
He's right?

692
00:36:07,367 --> 00:36:08,326
我说对了?
I'm right?

693
00:36:09,285 --> 00:36:11,204
我就是你们所称作的"古人"...
I am what you call an "Ancient"...

694
00:36:12,455 --> 00:36:15,833
而且事实上我也根本不能
向你们提供避难所...
and it is also true that I can
never offer your people sanctuary...

695
00:36:15,875 --> 00:36:19,295
不过我来这里的原因, 你们解释错了.
but you are wrong as to why I came here.

696
00:36:19,337 --> 00:36:20,880
你为什么来这里?
Why did you come here?

697
00:36:22,382 --> 00:36:23,174
你, John.
You, John.

698
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:26,177
我?
Me?

699
00:36:26,219 --> 00:36:30,515
我孤独的生活了那么长时间
这时你邀请我来到亚特兰蒂斯, 我...
I have lived in solitude for so long that
when you asked me to come to Atlantis, I...

700
00:36:30,557 --> 00:36:32,475
噢, 我的天哪, 他是Kirk.
oh, my god, he is Kirk.

701
00:36:33,518 --> 00:36:35,353
这么说从来不是为了 ...
So this was never about, ...

702
00:36:38,898 --> 00:36:41,568
我们能够独自在这里呆会么?
could we just have a
moment to ourselves here?

703
00:36:41,609 --> 00:36:42,569
不行
No.

704
00:36:42,902 --> 00:36:44,320
没关系
That's all right.

705
00:36:44,362 --> 00:36:47,073
我已经在这里呆得够长了
I've stayed here long enough.

706
00:36:55,915 --> 00:36:56,958
来吧, Chaya.
Come on, Chaya.

707
00:36:57,542 --> 00:37:00,461
你和你的人民是我们来这里的首要原因
You and your people were the
reason we came here in the first place.

708
00:37:00,503 --> 00:37:02,881
我不能... 我不能...
I can't... I can't...

709
00:37:09,888 --> 00:37:10,555
不
no.

710
00:37:11,681 --> 00:37:12,807
这到底是什么?
What the hell was that?

711
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:15,560
它们来了
They're coming for them.

712
00:37:16,728 --> 00:37:18,354
我不应该丢下他们
I should have never left them.

713
00:37:18,396 --> 00:37:19,898
发生什么了?
What's going on?

714
00:37:21,274 --> 00:37:22,108
我很抱歉, John.
I'm sorry, John.

715
00:37:44,839 --> 00:37:46,549
我要驾一艘飞船回到Proculis.
I'm taking a jumper back to Proculis.

716
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:48,343
刚刚发生了什么?
What just happened?

717
00:37:48,885 --> 00:37:50,345
要想可以找出原因我们只有一种办法
There's only one way to find out.

718
00:37:51,012 --> 00:37:51,888
去吧
Go.

719
00:38:14,827 --> 00:38:16,496
少校, 你可知道那边会是什么情况?
Major, are you sure you
know what you're flying into?

720
00:38:16,746 --> 00:38:19,082
我敢确信幽灵正在袭击Chaya 的人民
I have a pretty good idea the
Wraith are attacking Chaya's people.

721
00:38:21,709 --> 00:38:24,087
只有一艘船, 你别指望能打败它们!
You can't hope to
defend them with one ship!

722
00:38:24,671 --> 00:38:25,755
我想我也没有必要
I don't think I'll have to.

723
00:39:04,752 --> 00:39:05,837
你来这里做什么?
What are you doing here?

724
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,963
我来帮你
I'm here to help you.

725
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:08,506
帮我?
Help me?

726
00:39:08,548 --> 00:39:10,592
保护你的人民
To defend your people.

727
00:39:13,011 --> 00:39:13,553
离开
Leave.

728
00:39:15,221 --> 00:39:16,681
我会处理的
I will take care of this.

729
00:39:58,348 --> 00:39:59,557
是 "Chaya" 么...
Is it "Chaya"...

730
00:40:00,099 --> 00:40:01,976
或者是 "Athar"?
我只是很好奇
or "Athar"?
I'm just curious.

731
00:40:02,018 --> 00:40:03,853
当我是一个凡人时, 我住在这里
When I was mortal, I lived here.

732
00:40:04,437 --> 00:40:05,647
这是我的家
This was my home.

733
00:40:06,481 --> 00:40:09,484
当我们当中那些你们称之为古人的升天后
When those of us who
you call the ancients ascended,

734
00:40:09,525 --> 00:40:12,445
我们本应该抛弃我们的人类情节
we were supposed to
leave behind us all human ties.

735
00:40:12,487 --> 00:40:14,906
我们当中某些人发现这太困难了
Some of us found that difficult.

736
00:40:16,032 --> 00:40:18,201
所以你无法眼看着你的人民
So you couldn't
stand by and watch your people

737
00:40:18,243 --> 00:40:19,160
被幽灵清洗
而无动于衷
getting wiped out by the Wraith.

738
00:40:19,202 --> 00:40:22,330
当它们可怕的舰队接近时
我的心里就会非常不安
When their terrible fleet approached,
I lashed out with my mind

739
00:40:22,372 --> 00:40:23,998
只有一个念头, 把它们全部都消灭
and with a single thought,
destroyed them all.

740
00:40:24,874 --> 00:40:27,627
我同类中的其他人并不赞同这种干涉
The others of my kind did not
approve of such interference

741
00:40:27,669 --> 00:40:32,048
对有形事物的干涉
于是我就被放逐
with corporeal matters,
and so I was exiled.

742
00:40:33,007 --> 00:40:36,594
对我的惩罚就是无终止的保卫这个星球
My punishment was the
unending protection of this world.

743
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:44,269
那究竟为什么要装扮成人类?
Why pretend to be human at all?

744
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:47,981
这样, 日积月累
我就可以走到人民中去
So that, time to time,
I may walk among the people,

745
00:40:48,022 --> 00:40:51,359
作为仁慈友好的灵魂而被它们所接受
know them as the good and kind souls they are.

746
00:40:51,401 --> 00:40:56,656
几千年来
我来到又离开了那些村庄
For thousands of years,
I have come and gone to the villages,

747
00:40:56,698 --> 00:40:59,242
不过呆得都很短, 一直没有附上任何人...
never staying too long
to get attached to anyone...

748
00:41:00,785 --> 00:41:02,078
直道我遇见了你
until I met you.

749
00:41:03,746 --> 00:41:06,833
这些年来, 我从来没有对以前所作的选择后悔过...
I have never regretted the
choice I made all of these years...

750
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:08,668
直到现在
until now.

751
00:41:10,795 --> 00:41:13,840
我被允许保卫我的人民
不过仅限于我的人民
I am permitted to safeguard
my people, but my people only.

752
00:41:14,507 --> 00:41:16,050
这就是对我的惩罚
This is my punishment.

753
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:19,345
这就是它为什么被称之为惩罚
This is what makes it punishment.

754
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:23,766
如果你们的人来到这里寻求我的保护
If your people came
here for my protection,

755
00:41:23,808 --> 00:41:25,435
其他人就会阻止我
the others would stop me.

756
00:41:25,476 --> 00:41:27,186
你明白了么?
Do you understand?

757
00:41:27,228 --> 00:41:29,063
我无法帮助你们的人
I can never help your people.

758
00:41:32,358 --> 00:41:35,486
我想我不能如此轻松的走开
I'm not sure I'm willing
to walk away that easily,

759
00:41:35,528 --> 00:41:37,363
我也并不想在这里谈论个人问题
and I'm not just talking personally here,

760
00:41:37,405 --> 00:41:39,866
虽然这已经成为了事实...
although that's definitely part of it...

761
00:41:41,451 --> 00:41:43,953
我们仍然有很多东西可以向你们学习
there is so much more
we can learn from you.

762
00:41:43,995 --> 00:41:45,747
我不能, John.
I can't, John.

763
00:41:45,788 --> 00:41:47,540
其他人不会同意的
The others won't allow it.

764
00:41:47,582 --> 00:41:48,416
这只是...
That's just...

765
00:41:48,458 --> 00:41:50,543
他们最高的法则, 决不干涉
it is their highest law to never interfere.

766
00:41:51,711 --> 00:41:56,549
我被限制在这些法则中了
尽管我也很想帮助你
I am bound by those laws,
however much I wish to help you.

767
00:41:57,342 --> 00:41:59,385
如此, 那么, 我们不能...
So, uh, we can never...

768
00:41:59,427 --> 00:42:00,553
我不能离开
I can never leave.

769
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:04,182
好吧, 我可以到这里来看你
Well, I could come and visit.

770
00:42:07,685 --> 00:42:11,022
现在我正在挑逗一个其他的物种
Now I'm flirting with
somebody from another species.

771
00:42:11,064 --> 00:42:13,775
我们的差别并没有你所想象的那么大
We're not as different as you think.

772
00:42:13,816 --> 00:42:15,985
噢, 我想我们的差别比你想的要大
Oh, I think we're more
different than you think.

773
00:42:18,112 --> 00:42:19,239
我可以展示给你看
I can show you.

774
00:42:20,907 --> 00:42:21,616
展示给我看?
Show me?

775
00:42:22,408 --> 00:42:24,202
通过彼此之间的分享
By sharing each other.

776
00:42:24,869 --> 00:42:27,330
我们会像其他人一样, 相互了解对方
We will know each other
as well as anyone ever can.

777
00:42:27,372 --> 00:42:29,999
好吧
Okay.

778
00:42:30,041 --> 00:42:33,211
午夜之前我要把车送回去, 虽然
I've got to get the car
back by midnight, though.

779
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:36,839
这只需要花一点时间
This will only take a few moments.

780
00:42:38,424 --> 00:42:40,385
闭上你的眼睛
Just close your eyes.

781
00:42:50,353 --> 00:42:53,064
这可真是酷阿...


This is cool...
