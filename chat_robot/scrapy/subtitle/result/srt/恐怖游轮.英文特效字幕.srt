3
00:00:56,588 --> 00:00:59,348
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's all it was.

00:00:59,421 --> 00:01:03,375
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bad dreams make you think you've seen things that you haven't.

00:01:04,754 --> 00:01:08,241
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what I do when I have a bad dream?

00:01:08,353 --> 00:01:11,715
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I close my eyes and I think of something nice.

00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:02,911
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you see someone ring my doorbell?

13
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:04,538
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

00:03:41,981 --> 00:03:44,139
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I cleaned everything away, sweetheart.

16
00:03:44,215 --> 00:03:46,975
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everything is exactly the way it was before.

17
00:03:47,048 --> 00:03:50,672
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're clean and shiny. Look. Look. You see?

18
00:03:52,048 --> 00:03:54,535
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, all right. Just close your eyes.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi!

22
00:04:32,746 --> 00:04:34,176
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Permission to come aboard?

23
00:04:34,246 --> 00:04:37,733
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honey, hold this.

24
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:41,537
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So sorry we couldn't make it yesterday. Somebody was working late again.

25
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,038
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How're you doing, Sal?

26
00:04:45,145 --> 00:04:46,632
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm good. How are you?

27
00:04:46,712 --> 00:04:49,142
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm all right.

28
00:04:49,212 --> 00:04:50,471
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at you.

29
00:04:50,546 --> 00:04:51,511
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you like it?

30
00:04:51,578 --> 00:04:52,974
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You look great.

31
00:04:53,045 --> 00:04:54,976
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really? I just kinda threw it on.

32
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's had outfits laid out for a week.

33
00:04:57,078 --> 00:04:59,668
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're such a liar. You know my husband.

34
00:04:59,745 --> 00:05:02,141
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't listen to what he says. You know that.

35
00:05:02,212 --> 00:05:05,041
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I brought my really good friend, Heather. She's so nice.

36
00:05:05,144 --> 00:05:07,734
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Promise me you'll be attentive.

37
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:12,141
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How're you doing, man?

38
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:13,971
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's not to bring anyone.

39
00:05:14,077 --> 00:05:18,236
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't like her? Believe me, she's the best looking of Sally's friends.

40
00:05:18,344 --> 00:05:21,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Which it doesn't say much.

41
00:05:21,511 --> 00:05:23,533
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I asked you not to.

42
00:05:23,678 --> 00:05:27,336
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're living on a boat with an 18-year old boy and you're saying no girls.

43
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,504
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg, this is Heather.

44
00:05:30,644 --> 00:05:34,507
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's a very good friend of mine, and I just thought you guys should meet.

45
00:05:34,577 --> 00:05:37,041
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi.

46
00:05:39,876 --> 00:05:42,363
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you just excuse me for a moment?

47
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,636
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jess. You okay?

48
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:49,469
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think so.

49
00:05:49,543 --> 00:05:52,303
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey. What happened?

50
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:58,305
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey. What's the matter?

51
00:05:58,377 --> 00:05:59,534
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.

52
00:05:59,643 --> 00:06:01,835
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've got nothing to apologize for.

53
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:03,669
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is it? Are you okay?

54
00:06:03,743 --> 00:06:05,708
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just tired.

55
00:06:05,809 --> 00:06:09,036
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, listen, we don't have to go today if you don't want to.

56
00:06:09,142 --> 00:06:12,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, we do. I-I wanna go.

57
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:13,867
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You sure?

58
00:06:17,808 --> 00:06:19,363
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

59
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:21,571
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

60
00:06:21,675 --> 00:06:24,504
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah? Okay, come on. Come up here.

61
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:31,528
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is Sally and her husband, Downey.

62
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:34,368
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is Heather, Sally's friend. You remember Victor.

63
00:06:34,475 --> 00:06:37,338
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So let's go sailing!

64
00:06:37,408 --> 00:06:38,702
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

65
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:15,296
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey.

66
00:08:15,371 --> 00:08:17,029
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You okay?

67
00:08:18,804 --> 00:08:20,166
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is Greg okay?

68
00:08:20,236 --> 00:08:22,133
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's fine. He's upstairs.

69
00:08:22,204 --> 00:08:24,396
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've been asleep for a couple of hours.

70
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,798
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I had this terrible dream.

71
00:08:26,871 --> 00:08:28,233
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about?

72
00:08:28,336 --> 00:08:30,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't remember.

73
00:08:30,537 --> 00:08:32,229
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wouldn't worry.

74
00:08:32,337 --> 00:08:35,564
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Apparently bad dreams cure you of real life stress.

75
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:39,658
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As indeed does champagne. You want some?

76
00:08:39,737 --> 00:08:41,702
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

77
00:08:43,736 --> 00:08:45,724
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Downey, wanna give me a hand, please?

78
00:08:45,837 --> 00:08:49,962
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Actually, Victor, I'm a guest of the Captain's, but yes, I witt help you.

79
00:08:50,036 --> 00:08:53,126
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Victor, what was that back there at the harbor?

80
00:08:53,203 --> 00:08:54,633
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

81
00:08:54,703 --> 00:08:57,497
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I asked Jess if she was all right and you said no.

82
00:08:57,569 --> 00:09:00,056
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You told me she was bringing the little boy along.

83
00:09:00,169 --> 00:09:03,964
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When I was walking with her in the harbor I asked where he was.

84
00:09:04,035 --> 00:09:06,057
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She couldn't remember.

85
00:09:06,168 --> 00:09:08,224
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She stared into space for like 20 seconds

86
00:09:08,335 --> 00:09:10,357
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and then she said he's at school.

87
00:09:10,468 --> 00:09:12,524
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So?

88
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:15,658
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, it's Saturday. Ain't no school today.

89
00:09:15,736 --> 00:09:19,497
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Her son goes to a special needs school and it's open every day.

90
00:09:20,801 --> 00:09:22,857
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Be nice to her.

91
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:26,227
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right.

92
00:09:26,334 --> 00:09:28,561
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you boys sunbathe together?

93
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:31,292
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sometimes.

94
00:09:31,368 --> 00:09:35,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The champagne is not great but it is cold. Want some?

95
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:36,833
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No thanks.

96
00:09:36,902 --> 00:09:38,799
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, more for me.

97
00:09:38,867 --> 00:09:41,127
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, how are you feeling?

98
00:09:41,201 --> 00:09:44,291
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, I didn't realize how tired I was.

99
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:47,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You apologize one more time, and I'm gonna throw you overboard.

100
00:09:50,368 --> 00:09:52,299
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here.

101
00:09:52,367 --> 00:09:53,626
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You all right?

102
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,358
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

103
00:10:08,866 --> 00:10:11,353
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He thinks we're a fishing hoat.

104
00:10:11,467 --> 00:10:13,727
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's gonna go hungry.

105
00:10:15,633 --> 00:10:17,621
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want to steer?

106
00:10:17,699 --> 00:10:19,163
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nah.

107
00:10:19,232 --> 00:10:21,856
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go on.

108
00:10:25,033 --> 00:10:26,964
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Which way do I aim?

109
00:10:27,032 --> 00:10:29,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're gonna aim that way.

110
00:10:31,733 --> 00:10:33,357
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's easy, right?

111
00:10:36,199 --> 00:10:38,459
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, she's a waitress at some diner.

112
00:10:38,533 --> 00:10:41,123
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At least there they talk. They became friends.

113
00:10:41,198 --> 00:10:43,288
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, and she has an autistic son.

114
00:10:43,365 --> 00:10:44,659
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So they're just friends.

115
00:10:44,732 --> 00:10:46,321
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sally!

116
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,125
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you want me to say? I'm sorry she has a retarded son?

117
00:10:49,198 --> 00:10:50,856
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah!

118
00:10:50,998 --> 00:10:54,327
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I'm sorry. You know, that's not Greg's problem, that's hers.

119
00:10:54,397 --> 00:10:56,225
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is it, is it the shorts?

120
00:10:56,331 --> 00:10:59,296
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! Heather, Greg's been my friend for a really long time.

121
00:10:59,365 --> 00:11:01,886
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't just sit back and watch him get shaken down.

122
00:11:01,998 --> 00:11:03,485
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She isn't doing that.

123
00:11:03,564 --> 00:11:07,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I hope not because Greg is far too trusting.

124
00:11:07,198 --> 00:11:09,163
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm kinda linking the boy.

125
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:12,457
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh, no, you're not. Can you please go up there and talk to Greg?

126
00:11:12,531 --> 00:11:15,496
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I really think the two of you will be perfect for each other.

127
00:11:15,563 --> 00:11:18,858
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I really don't like seeing him with her.

128
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:22,188
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jess, are you ready?

129
00:11:22,296 --> 00:11:24,352
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, let her go.

130
00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:32,953
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

131
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,522
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Woo!

132
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,324
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, how do you know everyone?

133
00:11:40,396 --> 00:11:42,384
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Victor, he's staying with me for good.

134
00:11:42,496 --> 00:11:44,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He got in troubte at home. He had to get away.

135
00:11:44,695 --> 00:11:47,159
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I found him sleeping behind the store at the harbor.

136
00:11:47,229 --> 00:11:51,285
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, we got talking, and now he lives here.

137
00:11:51,362 --> 00:11:53,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just like that you let him move in?

138
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:56,159
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I got three rooms. I can't sleep in them all.

139
00:11:56,229 --> 00:11:58,955
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And Downey, I've known him since I was a kid.

140
00:11:59,029 --> 00:12:01,789
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sally, his wife, I know her from high school.

141
00:12:01,862 --> 00:12:04,383
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I dated her for like four days in the eighth grade,

142
00:12:04,495 --> 00:12:07,891
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so technically she's my ex.

143
00:12:07,996 --> 00:12:09,654
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They seem really nice.

144
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:13,785
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Except for the fact that every year they feel obliged

145
00:12:13,861 --> 00:12:17,223
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to bring me an eligible girl.

146
00:12:17,328 --> 00:12:19,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe they think you're lonely.

147
00:12:19,628 --> 00:12:21,616
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do I give off lonely to you?

148
00:12:21,694 --> 00:12:23,386
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sometimes.

149
00:12:23,495 --> 00:12:27,187
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When I come to see you at the diner, I'm not lonely, I'm hungry.

150
00:12:28,394 --> 00:12:31,518
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Obviously yesterday was different.

151
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:32,989
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happened yesterday?

152
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,786
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yesterday I was not hungry.

153
00:12:35,861 --> 00:12:38,621
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I came in with the sole purpose of inviting you sailing.

154
00:12:38,693 --> 00:12:41,055
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You did?

155
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,852
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I did.

156
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,116
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Turn at port side. We're losing wind.

157
00:12:50,194 --> 00:12:52,182
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me check it for]ust a sec.

158
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, things are okay with Tommy?

159
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,291
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The same.

160
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Every day is the same.

161
00:13:04,193 --> 00:13:06,987
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tommy likes the things to be a certain way. Yeah.

162
00:13:07,059 --> 00:13:10,717
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I do one thing differently, I lose him.

163
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,451
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's the matter? I've never seen you like this before.

164
00:13:16,526 --> 00:13:20,548
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. I just, uh, I just feel guilty when I'm not with Tommy.

165
00:13:20,658 --> 00:13:22,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's because you're a good mother.

166
00:13:22,626 --> 00:13:26,557
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you can't be everywhere all of the times.

167
00:13:26,659 --> 00:13:29,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, guys. Oh!

168
00:13:29,292 --> 00:13:31,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How is it going?

169
00:13:31,359 --> 00:13:33,324
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're good.

170
00:13:33,392 --> 00:13:38,221
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was]ust wondering if I could steal Jess away from you.

171
00:13:38,325 --> 00:13:40,381
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Salty's dying to tatk to her.

172
00:13:40,492 --> 00:13:43,286
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're kind of in the middle of something right now.

173
00:13:43,358 --> 00:13:45,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, it's okay. I-I should circulate.

174
00:13:49,024 --> 00:13:51,716
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, just for the record,

175
00:13:51,825 --> 00:13:54,984
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not interested.

176
00:14:11,223 --> 00:14:13,279
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yo, what the fuck?

177
00:14:15,057 --> 00:14:16,817
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wind's dropped down on us.

178
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,379
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not dropped, it's gone.

179
00:14:26,523 --> 00:14:28,317
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is crazy.

180
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,321
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You ever seen this before?

181
00:14:30,389 --> 00:14:33,842
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, yeah. Just not quite so sudden.

182
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:37,178
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are we okay to get home? There is no wind.

183
00:14:37,289 --> 00:14:39,776
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, yeah. We got an engine. It's not a problem.

184
00:14:39,856 --> 00:14:43,343
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just, it's weird.

185
00:14:43,456 --> 00:14:45,318
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg?

186
00:14:46,489 --> 00:14:48,215
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that normal?

187
00:15:13,854 --> 00:15:16,546
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, I'm fucking freaked, what the fuck.

188
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,376
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Triangle to coast guard. Over.

189
00:15:40,053 --> 00:15:42,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Triangle to coast guard. Over.

190
00:15:44,053 --> 00:15:46,041
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Coast guard, go ahead. Over.

191
00:15:46,187 --> 00:15:50,642
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've just gone from seven knots to absolute zero. You've got anything unusual? Over?

192
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,514
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing showing up. Over.

193
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:58,517
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's darkening up pretty quick out here. Looks like an electrical storm. Over.

194
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,982
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Help me. Please. Can you hear me?

195
00:16:02,052 --> 00:16:04,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Help me. Please, help me.

196
00:16:04,819 --> 00:16:08,807
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Killing everyone. They're dead. They're all dead.

197
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:12,282
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We hear you. What's your position? Over.

198
00:16:14,686 --> 00:16:18,344
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Distressed caller, we hear you. What are your coordinates? Over.

199
00:16:20,385 --> 00:16:24,214
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Coast guard, did you hear a distress call? We're not getting it anymore. Over.

200
00:16:24,352 --> 00:16:29,147
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Distressed caller, make another transmission. What is your position?

201
00:16:29,218 --> 00:16:31,308
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg?

202
00:16:48,151 --> 00:16:50,945
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get below deck now. Get the life jackets.

203
00:17:19,383 --> 00:17:22,212
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Out it. Out the sail.

204
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:27,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Vic, get the main sail down.

205
00:17:28,016 --> 00:17:29,981
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get it down.

206
00:17:34,382 --> 00:17:36,812

00:25:22,431 --> 00:25:25,191
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the same ship. This thing's old.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}1932. It's the same. Here's where we boarded.

283
00:25:34,197 --> 00:25:37,253
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah.

285
00:25:42,263 --> 00:25:45,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aeolus was the Greek god of the winds and the father of Sisyphus,

286
00:25:45,864 --> 00:25:49,091
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the man condemned by the gods to the task of pushing a rock up a mountain

287
00:25:49,163 --> 00:25:51,094
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and let it see roll back down again.

288
00:25:51,163 --> 00:25:53,128
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a shitty punishment. What did he do?

289
00:25:53,263 --> 00:25:57,024
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He cheated Death. No, he made a promise to Death that he didn't keep.

290
00:25:57,129 --> 00:26:01,424
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I studied it but I can't remember. Can we just keep on moving, please?

291
00:26:06,129 --> 00:26:07,923
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

292
00:26:30,595 --> 00:26:32,923
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoever it was might wanna come back for these.

293
00:26:32,995 --> 00:26:34,823
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me see?

294
00:26:38,261 --> 00:26:40,419
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These are mine.

295
00:26:40,495 --> 00:26:41,789
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These are my keys.

296
00:26:41,862 --> 00:26:43,292
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you talking about?

297
00:26:43,361 --> 00:26:44,348
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're mine.

298
00:26:44,461 --> 00:26:45,789
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bullshit.

299
00:26:45,861 --> 00:26:47,951
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is, this is my house key.

300
00:26:48,027 --> 00:26:52,083
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is my, my car key. This is my son. See?

301
00:26:52,161 --> 00:26:54,353
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait. So you had them with you on the yacht?

302
00:26:54,461 --> 00:26:56,517
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

303
00:26:56,628 --> 00:26:57,785
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's gotta be Heather.

304
00:26:57,861 --> 00:26:58,917
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

305
00:26:58,994 --> 00:27:00,788
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How else did they get here?

306
00:27:00,927 --> 00:27:04,688
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was Heather dropping her keys but not bothering to say, "I didn't drown."

307
00:27:04,793 --> 00:27:05,984
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why not?

308
00:27:07,994 --> 00:27:10,652
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

309
00:27:14,926 --> 00:27:16,356

310
00:27:29,326 --> 00:27:33,189
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Looks like you get your welcome party, just not the welcome.

311
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:42,813
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Heather!

312
00:27:42,925 --> 00:27:44,913
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yo, Greg, what time you got?

313
00:27:44,992 --> 00:27:47,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eleven thirty.

314
00:27:47,425 --> 00:27:49,322
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Heather.

315
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,021
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Heather!

316
00:27:58,292 --> 00:27:59,415
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where is everyone?

317
00:27:59,492 --> 00:28:01,013
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Heather!

318
00:28:01,124 --> 00:28:03,248
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sally! Please. Please.

319
00:28:03,325 --> 00:28:06,915
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know where everyone is but the ship's not deserted.

320
00:28:06,991 --> 00:28:10,615
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, maybe some of us think that it is but it's not,

321
00:28:10,691 --> 00:28:12,246
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so let's just go to the bridge.

322
00:28:12,325 --> 00:28:14,653
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll find the skipper and then we'll go home.

323
00:28:16,491 --> 00:28:17,682
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I saw someone.

324
00:28:17,791 --> 00:28:19,415
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck.

325
00:28:19,492 --> 00:28:21,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait.

326
00:28:29,591 --> 00:28:31,351
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

327
00:28:50,523 --> 00:28:53,283
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you see who it was? Was it Heather?

328
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:55,946
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't see.

329
00:28:56,022 --> 00:28:58,748
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.

330
00:28:58,822 --> 00:29:00,286
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where're you going?

331
00:29:00,356 --> 00:29:02,344
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why don't you just help me out here?

332
00:29:02,456 --> 00:29:04,148
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

333
00:29:04,255 --> 00:29:05,981
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just wait for Vic.

334
00:29:09,423 --> 00:29:10,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

335
00:29:10,489 --> 00:29:11,476
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's fine.

336
00:29:11,589 --> 00:29:13,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why can't we go with him?

337
00:29:13,188 --> 00:29:16,641
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's just do as Greg says and wait here for Victor, okay?

338
00:29:16,754 --> 00:29:17,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fine.

339
00:29:17,921 --> 00:29:19,476
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think Victor's in danger.

340
00:29:19,589 --> 00:29:21,781
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not worried about Victor.

341
00:29:21,856 --> 00:29:24,844
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry I'm acting weird. It's just I'm having deja vu

342
00:29:24,955 --> 00:29:26,579
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}every time I turn a corner.

343
00:29:26,654 --> 00:29:27,913
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no. No.

344
00:29:27,988 --> 00:29:29,452
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know this place.

345
00:29:29,522 --> 00:29:31,952
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, you don't know this place. You're just in shock.

346
00:29:32,021 --> 00:29:33,485
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's funny.

347
00:29:33,588 --> 00:29:35,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is it? What is it? Is it Tommy?

348
00:29:35,688 --> 00:29:39,483
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is it guilt? Is that what it is? Do you feel guilty?

349
00:30:02,254 --> 00:30:04,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

350
00:30:45,819 --> 00:30:48,147
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello.

351
00:31:27,784 --> 00:31:29,646
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello.

352
00:31:29,749 --> 00:31:33,737
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're on the third floor. The bridge is exactly two floors above us.

353
00:31:33,817 --> 00:31:37,146
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg, that was blood. Are you just gonna ignore it?

354
00:31:37,249 --> 00:31:39,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know guys that work on ships like this.

355
00:31:39,317 --> 00:31:42,578
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They see us, they get bored. They're just letting off some steam.

356
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:46,638
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? They rescue us from the sea and then they just hide for fun?

357
00:31:46,749 --> 00:31:49,145
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

358
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:51,181
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, what's your theory?

359
00:31:51,282 --> 00:31:53,746
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know, but I'm not, but I'm not in shock.

360
00:31:53,816 --> 00:31:56,838
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll be in the ball room. I'm getting off this ship.

361
00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:00,403
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jess, fuck! Don't you see that this is all just in your mind?

362
00:32:00,483 --> 00:32:03,914
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jess! Ships don't just magically appear out of nowhere.

363
00:32:03,983 --> 00:32:08,573
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They have skippers. I mean, in your world right now they don't.

364
00:32:11,981 --> 00:32:17,106
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My world is waiting outside school for his mother to pick him up.

365
00:32:17,182 --> 00:32:20,341
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't talk to me about my world.

366
00:32:21,582 --> 00:32:24,944
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jess. Jess, I'm sorry.

367
00:32:43,147 --> 00:32:45,475
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that blood?

368
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,245
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Babe, come on, we're supposed to meet them in the theater.

369
00:32:52,314 --> 00:32:54,676
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Heather!

370
00:32:56,746 --> 00:32:59,006
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my God. Shit.

371
00:32:59,113 --> 00:33:01,407
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sally. Sal, come on.

372
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,842
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's just go to the theater.

373
00:33:20,246 --> 00:33:23,336
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Downey, I can't see anymore blood. I don't think she's in here.

374
00:33:23,445 --> 00:33:26,308
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To be honest with you, I don't think she's even on the ship.

375
00:33:26,413 --> 00:33:28,344
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. So whose blood was that?

376
00:33:35,312 --> 00:33:37,174
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

377
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:42,607
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Downey? Sally?

378
00:34:16,177 --> 00:34:18,165
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Victor. What happened?

379
00:34:50,343 --> 00:34:52,171
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my God.

380
00:35:08,508 --> 00:35:13,405
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stay with me, Greg. Stay with me, man.

381
00:35:13,475 --> 00:35:14,837
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stay with me, man.

382
00:35:17,608 --> 00:35:19,766
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. No!

383
00:35:19,841 --> 00:35:22,169
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You fucking bitch! You shot him!

384
00:35:22,274 --> 00:35:23,261
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

385
00:35:23,341 --> 00:35:24,896
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He said you shot him.

386
00:35:24,975 --> 00:35:26,564
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't!

387
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,763
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fucking liar!

388
00:35:27,841 --> 00:35:29,237
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wasn't even with Greg!

389
00:35:29,308 --> 00:35:33,399
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's dead! He's dead! Look!

390
00:35:33,474 --> 00:35:35,268
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}God, you're a bitch!

391
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,571
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get your hands off him!

392
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,332
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't do it! I was with Victor.

393
00:35:47,506 --> 00:35:48,902
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Someone attacked him.

394
00:35:48,973 --> 00:35:50,733
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Someone?

395
00:35:52,006 --> 00:35:53,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think I did it?

396
00:35:53,407 --> 00:35:55,894
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why did you tell us to come to the theater?

397
00:35:55,973 --> 00:36:00,132
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't. L... Sally, I didn't.

398
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,727
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't.

399
00:36:01,806 --> 00:36:04,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My God, you're a fucking skitso.

400
00:36:05,606 --> 00:36:07,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sally, no.

401
00:36:18,473 --> 00:36:19,732
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sally!

402
00:36:19,805 --> 00:36:21,497
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

403
00:36:23,171 --> 00:36:26,727
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Downey!

404
00:36:28,573 --> 00:36:30,162
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let it go. Let it go.

405
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:32,099
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

406
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,292
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't shoot. Please.

407
00:38:52,732 --> 00:38:54,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please, don't shoot. Please.

408
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,287
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have a son. I have a son.

409
00:39:20,165 --> 00:39:21,959
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit.

410
00:40:15,563 --> 00:40:17,289
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who are you? Tell me!

411
00:40:18,729 --> 00:40:19,785
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who are you?

412
00:40:22,129 --> 00:40:23,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the fuck are you saying?

413
00:40:23,763 --> 00:40:25,921
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the only way to get home.

415
00:40:27,596 --> 00:40:29,584
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have to kill them.

416
00:40:30,796 --> 00:40:33,761
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kill them! Kill them! Kill them!

417
00:42:39,457 --> 00:42:43,252
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Over here. Come on. Hey!

418

419
00:42:48,324 --> 00:42:50,618
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Help!

420
00:42:52,558 --> 00:42:54,079
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey. Hey.

421
00:42:54,156 --> 00:42:55,882
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Help us!

422
00:42:55,957 --> 00:42:57,216
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please!

423
00:42:57,290 --> 00:43:01,153
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There, there. Over there. I can see somebody.

424
00:43:01,256 --> 00:43:03,312
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please!

425
00:43:37,289 --> 00:43:39,254
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

426
00:43:39,322 --> 00:43:41,048
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Looks like they decided to scratch the welcome.

427
00:43:41,122 --> 00:43:42,916
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go to the bridge.

428
00:43:42,988 --> 00:43:46,475
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll get the captain to put a call out to the coast guard.

429
00:43:51,321 --> 00:43:53,218
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello!

430
00:44:02,788 --> 00:44:04,275
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

431
00:44:12,287 --> 00:44:15,411
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where the fuck is everybody?

432
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:22,612
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you even know where we're going?

433
00:44:29,587 --> 00:44:33,211
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, we're just, just walking for the sake of it.

434
00:44:37,387 --> 00:44:38,874
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You all right?

435
00:44:38,952 --> 00:44:41,542
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I feel like I know this place.

436
00:44:41,619 --> 00:44:44,243
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I recognize this corridor.

437
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:47,773
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Liners, they look pretty similar.

438
00:44:47,885 --> 00:44:50,406
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, that's not it.

439
00:44:52,252 --> 00:44:53,978
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jess, come on.

440
00:44:54,085 --> 00:44:56,641
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the same ship. This thing's old.

441
00:44:56,753 --> 00:45:00,048
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. 1932.

442
00:45:00,118 --> 00:45:02,276
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is the same. Here's where we boarded.

443
00:45:02,385 --> 00:45:05,941
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Aeolus.

444
00:45:06,051 --> 00:45:08,209
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aeolus.

445
00:45:08,285 --> 00:45:11,409
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aeotus was the Greek god of the winds and the father of Sisyphus,

446
00:45:11,552 --> 00:45:14,779
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the man condemned by the gods to the task of pushing a rock up a mountain

447
00:45:14,884 --> 00:45:16,712
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}only to have it roll back down again.

448
00:45:16,785 --> 00:45:18,943
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a shitty punishment. What did he do?

449
00:45:19,085 --> 00:45:22,641
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He cheated Death. No, he made a promise to Death that he didn't keep.

450
00:45:22,751 --> 00:45:25,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I studied him and I can't remember. Can we just keep on moving?

451
00:45:31,084 --> 00:45:32,708
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

452
00:46:40,549 --> 00:46:42,741
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Heather?

453
00:46:43,815 --> 00:46:45,609
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello!

454
00:46:48,548 --> 00:46:50,536
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Heather!

455
00:46:52,748 --> 00:46:54,406
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Heather!

456
00:46:54,481 --> 00:46:58,207
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sally. Please. I don't know where everyone is.

457
00:46:58,281 --> 00:46:59,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But the ship's not deserted.

458
00:46:59,947 --> 00:47:03,378
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, maybe some of us think that it is but it's not,

459
00:47:03,448 --> 00:47:04,912
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so let's]ust go to the bridge.

460
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:07,968
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll find the skipper and then we go home.

461
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:10,442
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I saw someone.

462
00:47:54,145 --> 00:47:56,133
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

463
00:48:03,045 --> 00:48:04,771
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello.

464
00:48:15,211 --> 00:48:17,698
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit. How did you get here so fast?

465
00:48:17,777 --> 00:48:21,299
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Victor, you got, you gotta listen to me. We don't have much time.

466
00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:23,034
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, what's going on? Where's Greg?

467
00:48:23,111 --> 00:48:24,133
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's dead.

468
00:48:24,244 --> 00:48:25,538
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

469
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:27,438
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I mean, he was dead. He's not dead now.

470
00:48:27,545 --> 00:48:28,941
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you saying?

471
00:48:29,043 --> 00:48:32,633
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Downstairs right now is a copy of myself.

472
00:48:32,744 --> 00:48:35,732
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Me, walking and talking with Greg.

473
00:48:36,744 --> 00:48:38,732
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right.

474
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:47,204
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There.

475
00:48:47,277 --> 00:48:48,741
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's birds.

476
00:48:48,811 --> 00:48:50,605
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, that was Downey's body.

477
00:48:50,709 --> 00:48:53,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just left Downey back there. How did you get here so fast?

478
00:48:53,743 --> 00:48:56,105
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what I've been trying to tell you.

479
00:49:06,075 --> 00:49:10,268
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Downey was there. It was Downey's body.

480
00:49:13,443 --> 00:49:15,237
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There are bodies all over this ship.

481
00:49:15,309 --> 00:49:19,206
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your body is on the floor at the restaurant with a hole in your head.

482
00:49:19,275 --> 00:49:21,637
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, I'm gonna do you a favor, okay?

483
00:49:21,742 --> 00:49:23,866
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not gonna tell anyone about this.

484
00:49:23,941 --> 00:49:28,305
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the truth. Victor, we gotta get off this ship right now.

485
00:49:28,408 --> 00:49:30,373
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're saying there's two of you now.

486
00:49:30,442 --> 00:49:32,031
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

487
00:49:32,108 --> 00:49:33,629
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I'm dead in the restaurant.

488
00:49:33,741 --> 00:49:35,262
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were killed.

489
00:49:35,375 --> 00:49:39,101
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. So, I'm dead. Downey's in the water. He's dead, too.

490
00:49:39,208 --> 00:49:41,264
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is Sally okay?

491
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:43,805
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See where I'm going with this, right?

492
00:49:43,908 --> 00:49:45,736
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If we are dead and there's two of you,

493
00:49:45,808 --> 00:49:47,796
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}how are we all gonna get off this ship?

494
00:49:47,908 --> 00:49:50,202
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We should never have boarded this ship.

495
00:49:50,275 --> 00:49:51,967
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I knew something was wrong.

496
00:49:52,073 --> 00:49:55,402
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I should've forced you to stay on the yacht and you'd all be alive.

497
00:49:55,474 --> 00:49:57,598
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've gotta tell you I feel pretty alive right now.

498
00:49:57,741 --> 00:50:01,866
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Soon you're gonna be dead. Everything that happened to you, happened before.

499
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:04,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't even believe I'm talking this shit.

500
00:50:04,774 --> 00:50:08,227
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You will die and then, then Downey and Sally and then Greg.

501
00:50:23,373 --> 00:50:26,031
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't do this. I didn't do it.

502
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:43,936
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're on the third level.

503
00:50:44,039 --> 00:50:47,266
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg, that was blood. You just gonna ignore it?

504
00:50:47,373 --> 00:50:49,304
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know guys that work on ships like this.

505
00:50:49,439 --> 00:50:52,268
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They see us, they get bored. They're just letting off some steam.

506
00:51:02,805 --> 00:51:05,531
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you see that this is all just in your mind?

507
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:08,125
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ships don'just magically appear out of nowhere.

508
00:51:08,238 --> 00:51:11,725
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They have skippers. I mean, in your world right now they don't.

509
00:51:11,805 --> 00:51:16,237
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My wortd is waiting outside school for his mother to pick him up.

510
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:19,792
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't talk to me about my world.

511
00:51:32,804 --> 00:51:34,735
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who are you?

512
00:51:38,036 --> 00:51:40,058
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who are you?

513
00:52:35,601 --> 00:52:38,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who are you?

514
00:52:38,535 --> 00:52:40,523
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, listen to me.

515
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,792

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're dead. They're all dead. Please...

620
01:03:13,743 --> 01:03:15,503
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sally?

621
01:03:15,576 --> 01:03:18,507
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's your position? Over.

622
01:03:23,410 --> 01:03:25,272
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sally.

623
01:03:25,376 --> 01:03:28,671
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Distressed caller, we hear you. What are your coordinates? Over.

624
01:03:31,242 --> 01:03:35,173
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Coast guard, did you hear a distress call? We're not getting in anymore. Over.

625
01:03:35,243 --> 01:03:38,003
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg.

626
01:03:38,075 --> 01:03:40,596
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg, is that you?

627
01:03:45,008 --> 01:03:48,871
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Distressed caller, make another transmission. What is your position?

628
01:03:48,942 --> 01:03:51,202
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg, can you hear me? Greg.

629
01:03:54,041 --> 01:03:55,699
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit.

630
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:06,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sally?

631
01:04:13,174 --> 01:04:14,729
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sally?

632
01:05:09,072 --> 01:05:11,264
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my God, what happened to you?

633
01:05:11,372 --> 01:05:14,394
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get away from me.

634
01:05:14,505 --> 01:05:17,936
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It wasn't me, Sally. I didn't do this to you.

635
01:05:21,338 --> 01:05:23,859
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It wasn't me. Where is Downey?

636
01:05:23,938 --> 01:05:26,596
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know where he is.

637
01:05:26,705 --> 01:05:28,033
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You killed him.

638
01:05:28,104 --> 01:05:30,534
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

639
01:05:30,605 --> 01:05:34,001
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I didn't. I didn't kill him.

640
01:05:34,070 --> 01:05:35,193
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

641
01:05:35,270 --> 01:05:36,529
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I swear.

642
01:05:36,604 --> 01:05:38,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're crazy.

643
01:05:38,737 --> 01:05:40,759
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are you doing this?

644
01:05:40,871 --> 01:05:43,665
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sally, I know it's hard but you gotta trust me.

645
01:05:43,737 --> 01:05:46,099
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gotta trust me, okay?

646
01:06:13,403 --> 01:06:15,425
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, you gotta hold on.

647
01:06:15,536 --> 01:06:17,023
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think it will return again.

648
01:06:17,102 --> 01:06:21,158
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The yacht, the Triangle, I think it'll come back.

649
01:06:21,236 --> 01:06:24,167
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If it does, we'll escape, me and you together.

650
01:06:24,236 --> 01:06:27,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll re-board it and escape.

651
01:06:28,102 --> 01:06:30,396
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please.

652
01:06:33,435 --> 01:06:35,763
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't hurt me.

653
01:06:35,869 --> 01:06:38,231
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sally, I'm not gonna hurt you.

654
01:06:39,902 --> 01:06:42,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you hold on,

655
01:06:42,169 --> 01:06:44,759
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you can see Downey again.

656
01:07:12,067 --> 01:07:15,759
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, come on. Over here.

657

658
01:07:19,166 --> 01:07:21,756
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It returns when they're dead.

659
01:07:26,433 --> 01:07:29,864
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It returns when everyone's dead.

660
01:07:44,032 --> 01:07:46,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you think Heather woutd've made it on board?

661
01:07:46,433 --> 01:07:47,658
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honey.

662
01:07:47,732 --> 01:07:49,321
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a chance, isn't there?

663
01:07:49,399 --> 01:07:51,364
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Yeah, there's a chance.

664
01:08:42,697 --> 01:08:45,161
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop this thing.

665
01:08:45,230 --> 01:08:47,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop this fucking thing.

666
01:09:07,662 --> 01:09:09,718
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please.

667
01:09:09,829 --> 01:09:12,191
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wanna go home.

668
01:09:14,229 --> 01:09:16,489
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wanna go home.

669
01:09:42,528 --> 01:09:46,152
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's dead. I mean, he was dead.

670
01:09:46,228 --> 01:09:48,352
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's not dead now.

671
01:09:48,428 --> 01:09:50,722
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was hiding and I saw this version of myself,

672
01:09:50,828 --> 01:09:54,589
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and she had blood on her face, and then I killed her.

673
01:09:54,694 --> 01:09:56,488
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I killed her on the front of the ship.

674
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:58,491
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, I'm gonna do you a favor, okay?

675
01:09:58,561 --> 01:10:00,753
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not gonna tell anyone about this.

676
01:10:00,861 --> 01:10:02,758
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the truth. You gotta listen to me.

677
01:10:02,861 --> 01:10:05,155
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I'm not listening to another word you say.

678
01:10:05,228 --> 01:10:09,057
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You will die, and then Greg and then Downey.

679
01:10:39,025 --> 01:10:42,683
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't be scared, Victor. I can save you.

680
01:10:44,592 --> 01:10:47,079
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know how to save you.

681
01:12:01,989 --> 01:12:03,817
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should try and eat, babe.

682
01:12:06,756 --> 01:12:08,721
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jess?

683
01:12:20,554 --> 01:12:22,678
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jesus, what happened to you?

684
01:12:22,756 --> 01:12:24,311
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's Greg?

685
01:12:24,389 --> 01:12:26,979
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg told me to tell you we should meet in the theater.

686
01:12:27,055 --> 01:12:29,747
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a theater?

687
01:12:29,855 --> 01:12:32,479
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, it'just that way.

688
01:12:32,555 --> 01:12:34,042
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are you going?

689
01:12:34,154 --> 01:12:35,812
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll see you there.

690
01:12:35,888 --> 01:12:39,183
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, she's really starting to freak me out now.

691
01:13:16,652 --> 01:13:18,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you see that this is all just in your mind?

692
01:13:19,053 --> 01:13:23,007
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ships don't]ust magically appear out of nowhere. They have skippers.

693
01:13:23,085 --> 01:13:25,141
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In your world right now maybe they don't.

694
01:13:25,220 --> 01:13:30,311
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My wortd is waiting outside school for his mother to pick him up.

695
01:13:30,386 --> 01:13:33,249
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't talk to me about my world.

696
01:13:34,019 --> 01:13:36,415
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jess.

697
01:13:36,518 --> 01:13:38,346
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jess, I'm sorry.

698
01:14:15,084 --> 01:14:17,344
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, hey, hey, hey.

699
01:14:17,418 --> 01:14:19,383
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

700
01:14:19,484 --> 01:14:22,142
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take it easy, man.

701
01:14:22,218 --> 01:14:24,206
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just take it easy.

702
01:14:27,717 --> 01:14:30,045
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did we do? We're not part of this boat.

703
01:14:30,183 --> 01:14:33,705
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We just got here, okay? We've been walking around. There's no one on it.

704
01:14:33,816 --> 01:14:37,009
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can go right now. I will go.

705
01:14:37,083 --> 01:14:40,514
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay? Just... Just take it easy.

706
01:14:40,583 --> 01:14:42,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take it easy.

707
01:14:42,549 --> 01:14:44,309
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay?

708
01:14:49,883 --> 01:14:52,143
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jess?

709
01:14:53,049 --> 01:14:55,309
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jess.

710
01:14:55,383 --> 01:14:56,745
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jess, what are you doing?

711
01:14:56,850 --> 01:15:01,305
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wha... what is this? Why... what are you wearing?

712
01:15:01,382 --> 01:15:03,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't want you to see my face.

713
01:15:03,483 --> 01:15:05,004
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why?

714
01:15:05,082 --> 01:15:07,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because this is not me.

715
01:15:07,515 --> 01:15:11,207
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm somewhere out there in the yacht and you're with me.

716
01:15:12,582 --> 01:15:16,172
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And after I kill you, we'll return.

717
01:15:16,248 --> 01:15:18,406
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that right?

718
01:15:20,049 --> 01:15:23,411
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, why-why don't you just put down the gun first?

719
01:15:23,515 --> 01:15:26,207
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay? Come on.

720
01:15:26,315 --> 01:15:28,802
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see, the boat comes back when you're all dead.

721
01:15:28,881 --> 01:15:31,039
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've done everything exactly like before.

722
01:15:31,148 --> 01:15:33,977
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But when the boat comes back, I'll be ready, I'll be waiting.

723
01:15:34,048 --> 01:15:38,412
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll be on the landing bay. I won't let any of them board, even the other me.

724
01:15:38,514 --> 01:15:40,842
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll make them all stay on the upturned yacht.

725
01:15:40,914 --> 01:15:42,173
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

726
01:15:42,247 --> 01:15:46,235
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jess, we'll do whatever you want.

727
01:15:46,347 --> 01:15:49,709
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay? Just, just put down the gun.

728
01:15:52,581 --> 01:15:53,637
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

01:15:53,714 --> 01:15:55,201
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm so sorry.

730
01:15:55,313 --> 01:15:56,868
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no, no!

732
01:16:00,747 --> 01:16:02,575
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, God! What happened?

733
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:04,372
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was Jess.

734
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:08,172
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You fucking bitch! You shot him. He said you shot him.

735
01:16:08,247 --> 01:16:09,711
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wasn't even with Greg!

736
01:16:09,812 --> 01:16:11,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's dead! He's dead!

737
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:16,236
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My God, you're a fucking skitso.

738
01:16:18,712 --> 01:16:20,802
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Downey!

739

01:17:38,543 --> 01:17:39,973
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't kill me.

741
01:17:40,042 --> 01:17:44,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have a son.

742
01:19:04,206 --> 01:19:05,966
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who are you?

743
01:19:06,906 --> 01:19:07,962

01:19:09,706 --> 01:19:11,466
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who are you?

746
01:19:11,538 --> 01:19:14,025
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They'll return. You have to kill them.

747
01:19:14,139 --> 01:19:15,626
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the only way to get home.

748
01:19:15,706 --> 01:19:17,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the fuck are you saying?

749
01:19:17,239 --> 01:19:19,795
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the only way to save our son.

750
01:19:19,872 --> 01:19:21,302
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have to kill them.

751
01:19:21,373 --> 01:19:23,735
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kill them? Kill them?

752
01:22:49,530 --> 01:22:52,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hurry up, Sweetheart. We're gonna be tate.

753
01:23:27,396 --> 01:23:28,985
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's fun in buying you things

754

01:23:31,663 --> 01:23:33,719
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sick of telling you this, Tommy.

756
01:23:33,863 --> 01:23:37,954
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I ain't buying you anymore toys if you can't look after the ones you've got.

757
01:23:43,462 --> 01:23:45,858
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now what?

01:23:49,229 --> 01:23:50,989
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I'll just clean it up, shall I?

759
01:23:54,795 --> 01:23:56,953
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I'm]ust cleaning the fucking mess!

760
01:23:57,028 --> 01:24:03,551
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's the matter with you, huh? What's the matter with you?

761
01:24:03,662 --> 01:24:07,684
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just one day off is alt I ask. Just one fucking day off!

762
01:24:10,195 --> 01:24:13,456
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know why you can't paint a picture like a normal kid.

763
01:24:13,527 --> 01:24:15,991
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You get this from your father.

764
01:24:16,061 --> 01:24:18,321
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was an asshole, too.

765
01:24:32,727 --> 01:24:34,351
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit.

766
01:24:46,126 --> 01:24:47,886
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack?

767
01:24:47,992 --> 01:24:50,513
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you see anyone ring my doorbell?

768
01:25:27,558 --> 01:25:29,147
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tommy?

769
01:25:30,624 --> 01:25:32,384
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sweetheart, come here.

770
01:25:32,491 --> 01:25:36,115
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come here. Come here! It's okay.

771
01:25:43,191 --> 01:25:45,519
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mommy's fine, you see?

772
01:25:47,157 --> 01:25:48,883
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mommy's fine.

773
01:25:51,790 --> 01:25:54,482
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're just having a bad dream. That's all, baby.

774
01:25:54,558 --> 01:25:57,387
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's all it was.

775
01:25:57,490 --> 01:26:00,785
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bad dreams make you think you've seen things that you haven't.

776
01:26:47,022 --> 01:26:49,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Things are gonna be different now, Tommy.

777
01:26:51,155 --> 01:26:53,619
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mommy won't lose her temper anymore,

778
01:26:53,688 --> 01:26:55,846
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}even when you do things wrong.

779
01:26:57,188 --> 01:26:59,119
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And she won't hurt you.

780
01:27:00,321 --> 01:27:02,445
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know she won't hurt you.

781
01:27:02,521 --> 01:27:05,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know how I know that, Tommy?

782
01:27:05,954 --> 01:27:09,783
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because that woman that did those things to you is not Mommy.

783
01:27:09,854 --> 01:27:12,944
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is Mommy. Mommy's nice.

784
01:27:13,020 --> 01:27:14,507
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit.

785
01:27:18,554 --> 01:27:20,712
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit.

786
01:27:34,152 --> 01:27:36,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tommy, stay in the car.

787
01:27:36,386 --> 01:27:38,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna bury it, okay?

788
01:28:39,983 --> 01:28:42,675
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have to go. We have to get out of here.

789
01:28:47,117 --> 01:28:49,445
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop screaming, babe.

790
01:28:49,517 --> 01:28:52,311
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please, Tommy, it is just blood.

791
01:28:52,383 --> 01:28:54,211
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop screaming!

792
01:28:54,317 --> 01:28:57,009
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tommy, look. See? There, it's gone.

793
01:28:57,116 --> 01:28:59,376
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See? There. It's gone.

794
01:30:29,013 --> 01:30:31,205
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you all right?

795
01:30:36,713 --> 01:30:38,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who are you?

796
01:30:38,679 --> 01:30:40,371
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just a driver.

797
01:30:47,279 --> 01:30:50,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No point trying to save the boy.

798
01:30:50,812 --> 01:30:53,777
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's nothing anyone can do that's gonna bring him back.

799
01:30:57,378 --> 01:30:59,309
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I give you a ride?

800
01:31:04,011 --> 01:31:06,101
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

801
01:31:06,179 --> 01:31:08,871
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take me to the harbor.

802
01:31:31,177 --> 01:31:32,971
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey.

803
01:31:38,143 --> 01:31:40,505
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll leave the meter running.

804
01:31:46,476 --> 01:31:48,963
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You will come back, won't you?

805
01:31:51,344 --> 01:31:54,434
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, I-I promise.

806
01:32:15,109 --> 01:32:16,334
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jess.

807
01:32:20,809 --> 01:32:22,501
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you know me?

808
01:32:22,608 --> 01:32:26,164
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I feel like I do. Greg talks about you enough.

809
01:32:28,175 --> 01:32:29,935
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where is Greg?

810
01:32:30,008 --> 01:32:31,996
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where do you think?

811
01:32:32,109 --> 01:32:34,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, you're late.

812
01:32:34,141 --> 01:32:36,197
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're the one with the kid, right?

813
01:32:36,308 --> 01:32:38,932
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

814
01:32:39,008 --> 01:32:41,132
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How come you didn't bring him along?

815
01:32:48,140 --> 01:32:51,162
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's at school.

816
01:32:51,274 --> 01:32:53,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You sure about that?

817
01:32:53,941 --> 01:32:55,769
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

818
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:07,099
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you okay?

819
01:33:07,174 --> 01:33:09,798
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think so.

820
01:33:09,873 --> 01:33:12,337
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, what's the matter? What happened?

821
01:33:15,640 --> 01:33:17,104
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey.

822
01:33:17,173 --> 01:33:18,831
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.

823
01:33:18,940 --> 01:33:23,099
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have nothing to apologize for. What's the matter?

824
01:33:23,173 --> 01:33:25,104
