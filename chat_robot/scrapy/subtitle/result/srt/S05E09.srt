1
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:10,130
神经氨酸酶抑制剂...  神经氨酸酶抑制剂...
neuraminidase inhibitor...Neuraminidase inhibitor...

2
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:12,560
神经氨酸酶抑制剂...
Neuraminidase inhibitor...

3
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,500
听说你要去下外世界?
heard you're going off-world?

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,330
是的  我去协助一次复诊任务
i'm assisting with a medical follow-up

5
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,000
是在m33-985星球
On m33-985, yes.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,800
和凯勒一起
with keller.

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,900
没错
right again.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,630
在你休息的是时候
on your day off.

9
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,430
怎么了  我就不能在休息日去下外世界么
what, I can't go off-world in my free time?

10
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,400
可以  可以  你请便
no, no, go ahead.

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,130
我只是奇怪你啥时这么勤快
I just think it's odd that you're volunteering

12
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,660
在休息日自愿参与爱心任务
For goodwill missions on your day off.

13
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,160
我已不是以前的我了
well, I'm turning over a new leaf.

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,700
而是一个充满爱心温文尔雅的罗德尼·麦凯
It's a whole new kinder, gentler rodney mckay.

15
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,530
你来了
oh, there you are.

16
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,100
准备好了吗
You all set?

17
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,100
你也要来  是吗
you coming too, are you?

18
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,460
若楠说也来帮忙
yeah, ronon offered to help out, too,

19
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,600
我想多多益善  不是很好吗
So I just thought, you know, the more the merrier, right?

20
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,000
有问题吗
is there a problem?

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,760
没有  没有  没问题
no, no, no, just, I was...no, it's nothing.

22
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,600
好吧
okay.

23
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,030
查克  拨通星门  出发
Uh... go ahead and dial, chuck.

24
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:17,560
我来拿这个
i got this.

25
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,160
我拿得动的  我来拿这个
I'm good, I got it, I got it.

26
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,500
你要提这个?
I'm good. you want it?

27
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,560
你就提这个吧  我拿...
You take that, I got...

28
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,460
我拿我自己的东西
My own stuff I'll bring.

29
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,130
我们今天要治疗的病人
so, the people we're seeing today,

30
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,400
只要和他没有身体接触
As long as you avoid any physical contact,

31
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,660
应该就没事
You should be fine.

32
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,700
这病看起来不像是空气传播型的
The contagion doesn't seem to be airborne.

33
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,000
这里的人又得什么病了
what's wrong with these people again?

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,360
是一种类似地球上流感的病
it's a disease similar to one on earth Called influenza.

35
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,100
正在这村庄蔓延
It's been spreading throughout the village.

36
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,530
虽然不是什么大问题
Not too severe a strain,

37
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,300
但足以引起村民的恐慌
But enough to put a scare into them.

38
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,260
这孩子也得了
he's caught it, too.

39
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,860
情况怎么样
will he be all right?

40
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:00,100
烧得不重  多休息  多喝水
his fever's mild,so, plenty of rest, lots of fluids,

41
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,000
他就会好起来的
And he should be fine.

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,160
我会开点药
I'm also going to prescribe some medicine...

43
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,030
神经氨酸酶抑制剂?
oh, a neuraminidase inhibitor?

44
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:07,460
你不错啊
very good.

45
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,760
艾伦  我能不能给你也检查下
Can I have a look at you too, erran,

46
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,500
以防万一
Just to be on the safe side?

47
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:17,700
伙计们  你们能回避下吗
uh, do you guys mind giving us some privacy?

48
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,660
我知道这儿旁边有家小酒馆
I think there's a tavern close by.

49
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,400
你们为什么不去那吃点中饭
Why don't you go get some lunch?

50
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,760
你想要...  好的
You want to... sure.

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,560
你怎么了  不好吃?
what's the matter, you don't like it?

52
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,130
我说  你不必来这里的
you know, you don't have to be here.

53
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,200
在亚特兰蒂斯你一定还有很多事要干
I'm sure you got plenty of stuff To do back on atlantis.

54
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,860
事实上  我空闲的很
oddly enough, I don't, actually.

55
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,430
如果你要回去
But if you need to get back, then

56
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,030
不  我在这很好
no, I'm good.

57
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:49,260
你当然没事了
of course you are

58
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,530
你认为她们检查好了吗
you think we've given them enough time?

59
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,860
我可不希望在她们检查的时候
I don't want to interrupt

60
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,860
打扰她们
In the middle of medical... stuff.

61
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:00,030
凯勒医生检查好了吗
hi. um... is dr. keller done?

62
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,560
她没和你们在一起?
she's not with you?

63
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,100
她看完病后  就离开了
She finished with us, then left.

64
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,730
她说过和你们在小酒馆碰头的
Said she was going to join you at the tavern.

65
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:10,100
好的  谢了
oh. right. very good. thanks.

66
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,230
珍妮弗
jennifer?

67
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,430
珍妮弗
jennifer!

68
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,460
珍妮弗  我是罗德尼  你能听见吗
jennifer, it's rodney, do you read me?

69
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,760
珍妮弗
jennifer!

70
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,300
凯勒医生  请回话
dr. keller, please respond.

71
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,700
要么她的无线电失灵了
well, either her radio isn't working,

72
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,600
要么她关掉了
Or she's turned it off.

73
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,160
她不会关掉无线电的
she wouldn't do that.

74
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,400
那她发生什么事了
then what happened to her?

75
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,210
有发现什么吗
anything?

76
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,860
我查看了街道  没人看见过她
I've checked down the street, no one seeing her

77
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:35,790
失踪了
she is vanished

78
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,400
没道理啊  她不会就这样带着东西走了
that doesn't make sense. she wouldn't take off the facility sourse going

79
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,880
除非有人把她绑走了
or unless someone took her against her will

80
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,430
你去星门那
mabe you should go back to the gate

81
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,460
无线电联系总部请求支援
Radio atlantis for help.

82
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,600
也许你说的对
maybe you're right.

83
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,730
我呆在这儿
i'll stay here

84
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,230
查看下整个村子
And check the entire village.

85
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,030
你是谁
who are you?

86
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:24,130
如果你乖乖的  我就不用打晕你
if you'd stop struggling, I wouldn't have to stun you.

87
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,330
你想要什么
what do you want from me?

88
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,660
闭嘴
and stop asking questions.

89
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,660
我只想知道你为什么绑架我
i just want to know why you kidnapped me.

90
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,100
你是怎么把我带离村子的
How did you take me from the village?

91
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,160
我都不记得...
I don't even remember...

92
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,300
很好
good.

93
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,200
我们出发
let's go.

94
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,800
麦凯
mckay?

95
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,330
收到  说吧
yeah, go ahead.

96
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:54,360
我在村子外发现了脚印
i got some footprints outside the village.

97
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,500
是珍妮弗的吗
jennifer's?

98
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,360
百分百亚特兰蒂斯的步子
standard atlantis tread.

99
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,430
还有其他人的脚印
But there's someone with her.

100
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,360
比较大
Bigger prints.

101
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,600
和我的脚印差不多
Like my size.

102
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,900
看起来有过挣扎的迹象
Looks like there was a struggle.

103
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,860
该死
oh... dammit.

104
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,330
奇怪的是
weird thing is...

105
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,600
脚印就这么凭空出现在这里
It's like they just appeared out of nowhere.

106
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,460
凭空出现  什么意思
what do you mean, nowhere?

107
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,860
我是说这里和村子之间
i mean there's nothing at all

108
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,130
一个脚印也没有
Between here and the village.

109
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:17,300
就这么在这凭空出现
Then they just appear,

110
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,300
好像从天而降一样
Like they dropped out of the sky.

111
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,700
等下
wait a sec.

112
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,600
这里有一行伸向树林的单个人的脚印
Got a single set of tracks heading into the woods.

113
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,700
什么  一个人的脚印
what, a single set?

114
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,130
不是凯勒的  是另一个人的
not keller's, the other guy's.

115
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,060
那凯勒怎么样了
so what happened to keller's?

116
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,130
这些脚印比前面的要深
ah, these prints are deeper.

117
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,300
我猜是他扛着凯勒在走
My guess is he's carrying her.

118
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,630
很可能他打晕了凯勒  或者...
Probably knocked her unconscious, or...

119
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,230
我的天
oh, god.

120
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:47,130
我跟着脚印去看看
i'm going to check it out.

121
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,160
也许你该先等等
maybe you should wait.

122
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,460
好吗  我就快到星门了
All right? I'm almost at the gate.

123
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,360
我先用无线电联系  请他们派一支小分队过来
I'll radio ahead, get a team here,

124
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,030
进行仔细搜索
Do a proper search.

125
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,500
听起来不错  你快去吧
that sounds good. you do that.

126
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,160
我会继续跟着脚印的
Meantime, I'm going after her.

127
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,200
麦凯?
mckay?

128
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,260
收到
yeah, I'm here.

129
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:08,400
我找到两个人的脚印了
i got two sets of tracks again.

130
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,430
她仍然还活着
She's still alive.

131
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,900
太好了
oh, great! that's great!

132
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,300
我到星门了
all right, I'm at the gate.

133
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,860
我先去调配支小分队过来
I'll get the search teams mobilized

134
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,300
然后马上和你汇合
And join you shortly.

135
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,030
糟糕
oh, crap!

136
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,730
若楠
ronon!

137
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,900
什么事
what?

138
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,330
我遇到幽灵人了
we got wraith!

139
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:04,600
人数多少
how many?

140
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,030
4个刚刚穿越星门
four of them just came through the gate.

141
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:09,800
其中一个正在追杀我
One of them's about to kill me!

142
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,100
你总算...
Oh, finally! oh...

143
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,460
怎么花了这么长时间
what took you so long?

144
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:12,060
不客气
oh, you're welcome.

145
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,560
是追踪猎人
it's a hunter.

146
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,730
什么
what?

147
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,730
幽灵追踪猎人  他们在追捕逃亡者
wraith hunter. they chase runners.

148
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:18,800
我还以为逃亡者所剩无几了
i thought runners were extremely rare.

149
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,900
就像宇宙的繁星一点
Like, only a few in the galaxy.

150
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,230
没错
that's right.

151
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,730
几年前  我们遇到了你  现在又来一个?
so a few years ago, we run into you, now another?

152
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:23,730
这是什么几率啊这
What are the odds of that?

153
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,100
其他幽灵往哪个方向去了
where'd the other wraith go?

154
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,060
我不知道  他们分散穿进了森林
i don't know, they spread out into the forest.

155
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,230
你去哪里  你去哪里  等等
where're you going? where are you going? hey! wait!

156
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,460
我们留下的踪迹就到此为止了
this is as far as we go on the trail.

157
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,460
你打算把我带到哪里去
oh! where are you taking me?

158
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,700
至少告诉我你叫什么
at least tell me your name.

159
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,460
到了之后我们会有时间谈话的
there'll be time to talk when we get there.

160
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,960
哪里
where?

161
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,360
你在干嘛
what are you doing?

162
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,800
若楠
ronon?

163
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,630
小心
watch out!

164
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,600
我们需要把你们的人尽快
we need to get your people

165
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,000
转移到安全的地方去
To a safe place as fast as possible.

166
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,200
为什么  发生什么了
why? what happened?

167
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,060
我们确定幽灵人就在这个区域
we spotted wraith in the area.

168
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,800
幽灵人?  来这里?
wraith? coming here?

169
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,230
希望不是  我们刚见到了几个
hopefully not. it's just a few of them.

170
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,200
他们大概是在找什么人
We think they're looking for someone else.

171
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,760
但我们不能冒这个险
but we don't want to take any chances.

172
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,800
你最近有没有看见过
have you seen anyone different

173
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,660
不太平常的人来到这个村庄
In the village recently?

174
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,000
任何...任何新来的
Any... any newcomers,

175
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,160
任何看上去...
Anyone that looks, uh... uh...

176
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,460
像这样的
Like that?

177
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,530
没有
no.

178
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,300
没时间说这个了
we don't have time for this.

179
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,000
这里有没有能让人们躲的地方
Is there a place your people can hide?

180
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,430
这个村庄附近有数不清的洞穴
there are dozens of caverns surrounding the village.

181
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:00,000
我们的祖先在那次大屠杀中就是躲在里面的
Our ancestors used them during the last culling.

182
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,330
好的  我们快走
good. come on, let's go.

183
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:04,930
那是什么东西
what is that thing?

184
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,800
解释起来太费时间
take too long to explain.

185
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,800
太费时间?
too long?

186
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,630
我们已经走了几个小时了
We've been walking for hours now.

187
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,260
你至少也得让我休息一下啊
can I at least rest for a bit?

188
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,660
不行
no.

189
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,360
就几分钟
just a few minutes?

190
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,100
休息几分钟
a few minutes to allow your team

191
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,100
好让你的组员接近我们?
To gain ground on us?

192
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,100
什么组员
what team?

193
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,760
你来自亚特兰蒂斯
you're from atlantis.

194
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,360
你是一个医生
You're a doctor.

195
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,860
有两个男人和你同行
There were two men traveling with you.

196
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,530
脚下当心
watch your step.

197
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:41,760
保持前进
Just keep going.

198
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,300
穿过那条峡谷
It's just past that gully,

199
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,430
就快要到了
You're almost there.

200
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,700
就这样  对  脚下小心  先生
that's it, that's it. mind your step, sir.

201
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,560
先生?
sir?

202
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,560
夫...夫人  对不起
ma... ma'am. sorry.

203
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,030
你有...
I...you have a...

204
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,400
那是很明显的胡子
That is clearly a mustache.

205
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,130
这是最后一个
that's the last of them.

206
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,600
村庄已经空了
The village is empty now.

207
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,530
好的  你和他们一起去  让他们呆在洞穴里
good. go with them, make sure they stay in the caverns.

208
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,600
并且让他们保持安静  除非有我的消息
And keep 'em quiet, make sure no one makes a sound unless you hear from me.

209
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,530
或者我的
or me.

210
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:11,430
好的  谢谢
all right. thank you.

211
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,930
我们是不是应该回星门那里去了
hey, maybe we should go back to the gate?

212
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:15,260
不  你回去吧
no, go ahead.

213
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,930
我要去追凯勒了
I'm going to keep tracking keller.

214
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,630
我看现在分头不是一个好主意
i do not think it is wise for us to split up.

215
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,300
我们根本不知道幽灵人在哪里
We have no idea where the wraith are

216
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,600
回去的路太长
it takes too long to go back.

217
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,260
那个逃亡者把她抓走了
That runner took her.

218
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,430
如果让他们走太远
We let him get too far ahead,

219
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:24,630
我们就再也找不到了
We'll never find them.

220
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,560
如果你想去星门的话
look, you want to go to the gate,

221
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,260
那你就去  我走了
Go ahead. I'm leaving.

222
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,160
若楠  若楠
ronon? ronon!

223
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,430
我...妈的
i...oh, dammit!

224
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,760
你不能...若楠
Would you just...ronon!

225
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:43,900
不会再逃了吧
you done trying to escape?

226
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,560
更多幽灵人在靠近
More wraith close by.

227
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,060
我们得继续前进了
We need to keep moving.

228
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,760
你不是村庄里的人  对吗
you're not from the village, are you?

229
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,830
我从没见过你
i've never noticed you,

230
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,700
这里几乎每个人我都认识
And I pretty much met everyone.

231
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,200
你是这个星球上的吗
Are you even from this planet?

232
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,530
是你把幽灵人引来的
you're the one who brought the wraith here.

233
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:07,360
他们在追你  为什么
They're after you. why?

234
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,060
我是一个逃亡者
i'm a runner.

235
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,400
你了解逃亡者吗
you know about runners?

236
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,400
和我同行的一个人
one of the men I'm traveling with,

237
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,730
他以前就是
He used to be one.

238
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,160
现在不是了?
used to be?

239
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,300
这不可能
That's impossible.

240
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,860
逃亡者不可能停止逃亡
Runners don't stop being runners.

241
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,200
是吗  他就能
yeah? well, this one did.

242
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,800
是吗  他如何做到的
yeah? well, how?

243
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,500
把我带到他那里去  我们就会告诉你
take me to him, and we'll tell you.

244
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:28,000
我保证
i promise.

245
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,800
听着  我们不需要成为敌人
Look, we don't have to be enemies.

246
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,100
得了吧
nice try.

247
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,400
喂  如果你...
hey! if you...

248
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,330
干嘛
what?

249
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:45,230
从这里开始  凯勒的踪迹又出现了
this is where keller's tracks start up again.

250
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:48,260
看  更小了  更浅了
look, smaller, shallower,

251
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,360
亚特兰蒂斯步
Atlantis tread.

252
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,230
这些脚印更大更深
These prints are bigger and deeper.

253
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,660
是逃亡者的
the runner.

254
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,560
凯勒的脚印不对称
keller's tracks are uneven.

255
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,400
她不是受伤了就是被绑了
She's either hurt or bound.

256
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,130
或许两者都是
Probably both.

257
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,260
至少这些脚印还算清楚
well, at least the tracks are clear, though.

258
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,500
很容易追踪  对吧
Easier to follow, right?

259
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,030
问题就在这儿
that's the problem.

260
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:08,000
没有一个逃亡者会如此笨
No runner is that stupid.

261
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:13,460
天马上就要黑了
it's going to be dark soon.

262
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:17,600
实际上  我们还有2小时43分钟17秒
actually, we have two hours, 43 minutes, and 17 seconds.

263
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,260
这星球这个时节太阳落山非常缓慢
This planet's sun currently has a very gradual angle of descent

264
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,800
夜晚也很短
And a very short night.

265
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,100
我一向特别留意下载各个星球的数据
I always make it a point to download the planetary data

266
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,830
凡是那些我去过的  包括那些考察项目
On every address I dial, even goodwill missions.

267
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,900
比如说大气情况
Yeah, things like atmospheric conditions,

268
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,430
土壤稠性  可用的水源什么的
Soil consistencies, available water supplies...

269
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:33,560
干嘛
what?

270
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,830
我只是在想  如果没有你手上的那个小玩意
just wondering how long you'd make it out here

271
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:36,930
你还能坚持多久
Without your little gadgets.

272
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:38,100
我想你会大吃一惊的
you know, I think you'd be surprised.

273
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,830
我的意思是  可能我并不像你们那样
You know, I mean, I may not be exactly

274
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:42,360
是一个所谓户外生活高手
What you'd call an outdoors person,

275
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,800
但这并不代表我不懂得体验
But that doesn't mean I don't find

276
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,400
人类对抗自然过程中的乐趣
The whole man vs. nature thing uninteresting.

277
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,230
我小时候参加过
Hell, I joined a scouting organization

278
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,600
一个童子军之类的组织
When I was a child.

279
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,430
麦穆里堡海狸捕捉团第14分队
Lodge 14 of the fort mcmurray eager beavers.

280
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:52,430
海狸
beavers?

281
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,430
是啊  大型啮齿动物  牙齿很大
yep. large rodent. big teeth.

282
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:56,160
能把树咬断
They use 'em to chop down trees

283
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,960
然后造水坝  很勤奋的
And build dams...very industrious.

284
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,630
我就去了几个月
I was with them for a few months

285
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,860
然后他们就叫我走了
Before they asked me to leave,

286
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,330
但我得到了指南手册
But I got the manual-->

287
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:04,500
我还保存着呢  "捕捉海狸"
Still have it--> scouting for beavers.

288
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,060
很珍贵的资源
Valuable resource.

289
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,400
所以  你会发现  在紧要关头
So, I think you'll find, in a pinch,

290
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,960
我绝对能自保的  非常感谢...
I handle myself very well, thank you very...

291
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,400
这是什么
What is it?

292
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,330
血
blood.

293
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,460
我的天
oh, my god.

294
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:17,000
不  这是幽灵人的血
no, it's wraith blood.

295
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,700
看这里
Here we go.

296
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,030
有人在这儿坐过
Someone was sitting here.

297
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,700
看
look.

298
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:29,430
单人的脚印
Single set of tracks...

299
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:32,000
但他们是留下那脚印  人却往这边走了
But they left the trail going that way.

300
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,230
你确定吗
are you sure?

301
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,530
脚印是往这边的
'cause the footprints keep going this way.

302
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,100
单人脚印
single set.

303
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,060
是的  我知道  但有可能他是把她背着呢
yeah, I know, but maybe he's carrying her again.

304
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,900
或者他们被幽灵人攻击了
Or maybe they were attacked by the wraith,

305
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,630
珍妮弗吓昏了
Jennifer was stunned,

306
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:44,030
然后逃亡者杀死了幽灵人
And then the runner kills the wraith

307
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,460
处理掉尸体
And disposes of the body,

308
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:48,200
背着珍妮弗继续走
And then carries jennifer on up the trail.

309
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,630
看这些脚印多深
Look how deep these tracks are.

310
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,630
我说我们应该走这边
I say we follow these.

311
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:28,400
我说的吧  逃亡者没有那么笨
like I said, no runner is that stupid.

312
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:33,130
现在怎么办
what now?

313
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,530
我们上去
we go up.

314
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:38,130
上去?  怎么上  你有绳子吗
up? how? do you have a rope?

315
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,800
不需要绳子
no need for ropes.

316
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,730
我们刚才...
did we just...

317
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:51,400
你是怎么做到的
How did we do that?

318
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,560
回来后  我在一个星球上待过
i was on a planet a while back.

319
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,700
那儿全是高科技
Lots of technology.

320
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,930
从当地人那儿弄来了这个
Got this from one of the locals.

321
00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:00,430
几乎一接触我的皮肤就吸上去了
Barely put it on my arm before it fused to my skin.

322
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:02,400
从那时起  只要绿灯亮时我按这儿
since then, if I hit this light when it's green,

323
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,700
我就能"幻影移形"了
I can disappear, move around from place to place.

324
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,100
空间转移
teleportation.

325
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,060
怪不得你能那么快把我从村里弄出来
That's how you got me out of the village so fast.

326
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,830
只能短距离传送
i can only go short distances.

327
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:11,930
下一跳之前
It needs time to recharge

328
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,400
就得充电
Between jumps,

329
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,900
尤其还带这个人
Especially when I take someone with me.

330
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,830
但这样幽灵人总追不上我的
But it's helped me stay ahead of the wraith.

331
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,700
我想也是
i imagine so.

332
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,730
麦凯
mckay!

333
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,400
该死
Dammit.

334
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,030
你究竟在干嘛
what the hell were you doing?

335
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,200
没看到吗
at the moment?

336
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,400
杀幽灵人呢!
Killing wraith!

337
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,230
那你停下来干什么
what are you stopping for?

338
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,600
我鞋子里有石头  我早说了
i had a stone in my boot, I told you.

339
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,760
你没说
no, you didn't.

340
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,960
我说了!  我说"等会儿
i did! I said "wait up,

341
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,260
我鞋子里进了石头"
I got a stone in my boot."

342
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,500
你每浪费一秒
every second you lag behind

343
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,200
我追踪那人就越难
Makes it that much harder for me to track this guy.

344
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,400
特别是天黑后
Especially at night.

345
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,760
不会的
not anymore.

346
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,360
我们不用再追踪痕迹了
We don't have to play mantracker now.

347
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,930
马上就能知道这家伙在哪儿
We're going to know exactly where this guy is...

348
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,930
多亏这方便的小玩意儿了
Thanks to this handy gadget.

349
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,200
看看这个信号
look at that signal.

350
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,400
他们跑的比我想象的远多了
They're even farther away than I thought.

351
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,060
我保证
Arantee you,

352
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,560
你总归需要我帮忙的
At some point, you'll need my help.

353
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,700
迟早的
you'll see.

354
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,230
总有你解决不了的问题
There'll be some problem you can't solve,

355
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,330
你就会来找我
Then you'll turn to me,

356
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:27,060
我及时搞定
I'll figure it out in the nick of time.

357
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,160
你要么说  "干的漂亮"
You'll say, "good job,"

358
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,600
要么不屑一顾
Or just grunt

359
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,530
要么拍拍我以示鼓励
Or slap me on the back harder than necessary,

360
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:33,130
总之  关键在于我们各有所长
Anyways, the point is... we both have our gifts.

361
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:36,260
你就别老觉得我多余了
So you need to stop resenting my presence here,

362
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,230
应该意识到我们是一条船上的
And start realizing we're on the same team,

363
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:40,200
为同一目标而奋斗  对吧
Both trying to achieve the same goal. all right?

364
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,860
你在听么
You listening?

365
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,030
我们有了跟踪器
We got the tracker.

366
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,360
你在听我说吗
Can you hear what I'm saying here?

367
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,360
你什么时候才能告诉我
when are you going to tell me

368
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,730
你想从我这儿得到什么
What you want from me?

369
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:49,000
某人需要你的帮助
i need you to help someone.

370
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,060
谁啊
who?

371
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,630
你无需知道
that's not important to you.

372
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:54,600
只需帮她治疗
You just need to give her medical attention.

373
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,330
她是谁?  你的妻子?
her? who is she, your wife?

374
00:18:58,330 --> 00:18:59,960
一旦到那儿
when we get there,

375
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,360
我不能和你们待在一起
I won't be able to stay with you.

376
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,100
我在一个地方滞留的越久  那儿就越危险
The longer I'm in one place, the greater the danger.

377
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,830
说不定又引来一群幽灵人呢
Probably at least a dozen more wraith on the way.

378
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,960
踪迹到这儿就消失了
trail ends here.

379
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,330
他就在前方啊
well, he's dead ahead.

380
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:12,660
要么爬上峭壁
So either he climbed this thing,

381
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,000
要么想法子绕过去
Or he figured out how to get around it.

382
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,360
没有迹象表明他们绕过去了
no sign they went around.

383
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,530
那他们得用绳子什么的
well, so they must've had a rope or something.

384
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:18,700
不像我们
Unlike us.

385
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,260
我们怎么上去呢
Look, how are we going to get up there?

386
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,300
你刚刚不是说什么解决问题的么
you said something about solving a problem?

387
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,830
是啊  高科技问题  又不是攀岩问题
yeah, technological problems, not rock-climbing problems.

388
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,330
早料到了
thought so.

389
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,100
你可曾想过
have you ever thought about

390
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,460
摆脱那个跟踪装置吗
Trying to remove that tracking device?

391
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,200
想过啊
you could say that.

392
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,060
一些医生试过了
Had a few doctors try.

393
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,230
却从没成功
No luck.

394
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:40,160
我这儿有先进的医疗技术装置
i have advanced medical technology with me.

395
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,160
我知道
i know.

396
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,130
也许能帮你移除掉
so I could probably remove it.

397
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:45,200
记得我跟你说过的那个逃亡者吗
The runner I was telling you about?

398
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,230
其中一个医生帮他移除了跟踪装置
One of our doctors removed his tracking device.

399
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,660
他就再也不用逃亡了
That's how he was able to stop being a runner.

400
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,560
你包里有东西能移除它吗
you have something in here that can remove it?

401
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,200
有个扫描仪
i have a scanner.

402
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,060
用它可以精确定位
With that, I can pinpoint

403
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,760
跟踪仪的位置
The location of your tracking device,

404
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,330
将你麻醉后
Give you some anesthetic,

405
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,900
快速切个口  你就解脱了
Make a quick incision, you're free of it.

406
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,030
我
i...

407
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,200
听着  你不是说有人
look, you say there's someone

408
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,530
需要医疗救助吗
Who needs medical attention?

409
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:06,300
对所有人而言
It's going to be a lot safer for all of us

410
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,360
能甩掉幽灵人的跟踪
If we throw the wraith

411
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,400
再好不过了
Off your trail

412
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,400
在我们抵达之前
Before we get there.

413
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:30,400
好了
okay.

414
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,230
转过去
turn around.

415
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,900
如果你想
if you try anything...

416
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,530
回过身去
just turn around.

417
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,030
看到了吗
do you see it?

418
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,800
你看到了什么
what did you see?

419
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,730
你的跟踪装置
your tracking device...

420
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,730
和一般的不同
It's different...

421
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:03,430
更为复杂
It's much more complicated.

422
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,030
有许多分枝
It's branched out,

423
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,460
不仅融进脊椎
Fused not only to your spine,

424
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,400
也进入了脑干
But also your brain stem.

425
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,430
移除它会要了你的命
Removing it would kill you.

426
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,260
我很抱歉
i'm sorry.

427
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,100
我们得继续前进了
we need to get moving.

428
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,800
离天黑还有17分钟
okay. nightfall, 17 minutes,

429
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,430
如我所说  非常简单
But like I said, it's very brief.

430
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:44,030
就像  六月的白马城
Like, uh, whitehorse in june.

431
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,460
不是说你不知道
Oh, not that you have any idea

432
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,660
白马城是什么
What whitehorse is,

433
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,930
或许是六月  关于这事儿
Or june, for that matter...

434
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:49,730
这是?
what the...?

435
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,300
亲娘啊  你看到了吗
holy crap! did you see that thing?

436
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,030
这家伙真厉害
this guy is good.

437
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:04,760
简直就是职业杀手
this guy's a killer!

438
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,960
很好
good.

439
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,430
没人发现
No one found it.

440
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,400
发现什么
found what?

441
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,160
她叫西丽斯
her name is celise.

442
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,160
她怎么了
what happened to her?

443
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,160
摔下来  伤了腿
she fell, injured her leg.

444
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:37,230
我尽力清理了伤口  但是
I did my best to clean the wound, but...

445
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,130
感染了
it's infected.

446
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,600
什么时候发生的事
When did this happen?

447
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,630
几天前
a few days ago.

448
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,560
病情越发严重
when she got worse,

449
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,060
我便去寻找医生
I went looking for a doctor.

450
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,530
我们去了三个星球
We went to three different planets.

451
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:49,300
听说亚特兰蒂斯的人
I heard there were people from atlantis

452
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,730
在村中行医救人
Helping the village here with their sickness.

453
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:53,230
我就把她带来了
So I brought her here,

454
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:54,800
藏在这山洞里
Found this cave to hide her,

455
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,660
设下陷阱以防幽灵人
Set a few traps to keep the wraith

456
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,930
或其他什么人
Or anyone else away,

457
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:01,200
然后等你出现
Then waited for you to show up.

458
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,960
其实你可以直接向我求助
you know, you could've just asked for my help

459
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,730
用不着绑架我的
Instead of kidnapping me.

460
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:07,860
我不能冒这个险
i couldn't take that chance.

461
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:11,360
大多数人都不愿和逃亡者扯上关系
Most people don't want anything to do with runners.

462
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,930
她是你女儿吗
is she your daughter?

463
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:18,230
不是
no.

464
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,260
她住在村子里
She lived in a village

465
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,900
那里已经被幽灵人毁了
That was destroyed by the wraith.

466
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:25,300
我猜是你把幽灵人引过去的吧
let me guess. you brought the wraith there?

467
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,330
我在那儿就待了一夜
i stayed there one night.

468
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:30,230
没想到他们这么快就找到我了
I didn't think they'd find me that fast.

469
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:32,760
他们血洗了整个村庄
The culled the whole village.

470
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,060
西丽斯是我唯一救下来的
Celise was the only person I could save.

471
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,600
她的情况有多糟
how bad is she?

472
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,600
非常糟
very bad.

473
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,930
她的血压低的可怕
Her blood pressure's dangerously low.

474
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:48,000
伤口已经腐烂  就要休克了
She's septic, going into shock.

475
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,400
什么意思
what does that mean?

476
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,800
就是说伤口坏死了
it means the wound is necrotic.

477
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,960
得动手术清除了
I'm going to have to surgically debride it,

478
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,660
切除坏死组织
Cut away the dead tissue.

479
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,860
我要先给她注射抗生素
I'm going to start her on an i.v. antibiotic,

480
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,360
但她需要的
But she needs

481
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,160
是比这更强的药
much stronger medications than I have with me.

482
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:06,100
她病得非常非常重
She's a very, very sick girl.

483
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,400
她不能死
She can't die.

484
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,330
你不能让她死
You cannot let her die.

485
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,260
我会尽力而为
I'll do what I can.

486
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:18,460
我就在附近
I'll be close by.

487
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,130
别紧张
It's okay.

488
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:46,030
别紧张  我是来帮你的
It's okay, I'm here to help you.

489
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,230
我给你的腿上了点麻药
I gave you some medicine to numb your leg.

490
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:51,730
还觉得痛吗
Do you feel any pain?

491
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:57,630
好的  那就好
Good. That's good.

492
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,660
基里克在哪里
Where's Kiryk?

493
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,660
基里克
Kiryk.

494
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,830
原来这就是他的名字
So that's his name.

495
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,800
他在外面守着
He's just outside, keeping watch,

496
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,300
保证你的安全
making sure you're safe. okay?

497
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:15,430
那个娃娃很漂亮
That's a beautiful doll.

498
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:18,160
基里克给我做的
Kiryk made it for me.

499
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,560
刻薄的老基里克
Mean old Kiryk, huh?

500
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,230
想也知道
Go figure.

501
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,260
他不刻薄
He's not mean.

502
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:28,260
他只是装成那样
He just pretends to be.

503
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,760
我认识个和他一样的人
I know someone just like him.

504
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,760
信号在打圈
The signal's circling.

505
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,130
不管那人把她带到哪儿
Wherever he's taking her,

506
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:40,730
他们肯定到目的地了
I think they've arrived.

507
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:42,100
离天亮还有多久
How long before daybreak?

508
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,900
不久  可能1小时之内
Not long now. Maybe under an hour.

509
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,560
很快
It's pretty short.

510
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:49,700
你在干嘛  开枪啊
What are you doing? Shoot it!

511
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,630
不准动
Don't move.

512
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,300
又排除一个陷阱了
One less trap to worry about.

513
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:14,300
你这算是安慰吗
Is that supposed to be comforting?

514
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,930
你吓到我了
You scared me.

515
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:28,230
她怎么样了
How is she?

516
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:29,800
我尽力
I debrided the wound,

517
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,060
清理了伤口
cleaned it as best I could,

518
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:35,100
但她还没脱离危险  从长远来说
But she's not out of danger, not by a long shot.

519
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:38,200
她需要更强力的抗生素来支撑
She needs a much stronger antibiotic regimen,

520
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,030
更别提考虑皮肤移植了
Not to mention the probability of a skin graft.

521
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,130
我想把她带到亚特兰蒂斯
I'd like to take her to Atlantis.

522
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,600
我们的医务室
Our infirmary can provide her

523
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,330
能给她更适合的照料
with the proper care she needs.

524
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:49,760
我不能去亚特兰蒂斯
I can't go to Atlantis.

525
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,960
我知道
I know.

526
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,730
你要相信我能照顾她
You're going to have to trust me with her care.

527
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:01,200
只要你答应她一痊愈你就把她带回给我
As long as you return her to me when she's healed.

528
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,600
基里克你要明白
Kiryk, you have to understand something.

529
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,460
并没有什么能保证她脱险
There's no guarantee she's going to survive this.

530
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,160
她还是病得很重
She's still very sick.

531
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,860
即使她能活下来...
But if she survives...

532
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:12,500
不停地被幽灵人追捕
Being constantly hunted by the wraith

533
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,960
也不是孩子该有的生活
is no life for a child.

534
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,500
你明白的
You know that.

535
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,630
如果你真要她活下来
If you really want her to live,

536
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:21,860
你就要放她走
you need to let her go.

537
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:24,800
如果我早知道她会...
if I knew that she would--

538
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,800
那是什么
What is it?

539
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:09,560
基里克?
Kiryk?

540
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,760
发生什么事
What happened?

541
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,030
幽灵人打晕了你
The wraith stunned you.

542
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:01,460
还差点杀死了西丽斯
Almost killed Celise.

543
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,430
我弄不醒你
I couldn't revive you--

544
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:05,000
他们一定对你用了
They must've hit you with a triple dose

545
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,860
普通剂量的三倍
of whatever is in those stunners.

546
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:08,830
总之  我觉得我们必须离开那个山洞
Anyway, I knew we had to get away from the cave,

547
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:12,200
所以我把西丽斯带到了这里  然后再回去
So I carried Celise here, and then I went back,

548
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,730
把你一路拖到了这里
And literally dragged you the distance.

549
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:18,160
我告诉你  累得我够呛
Not an easy task, let me tell you.

550
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,360
她怎么样了
How is she?

551
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,400
就目前来说  还比较稳定
Stable, for the time being.

552
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:25,060
但她还是高烧不退
But... her fever is still very high.

553
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,560
她在这个星球待得越久
The longer she stays on this planet,

554
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:30,330
危险就越大
the greater the danger.

555
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:33,330
我来背她
I'll carry her.

556
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:34,730
我们回星门
We'll head back for the gate.

557
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:36,560
在幽灵人还对我们紧追不舍的情况下?
With the wraith closing in on us?

558
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,930
你觉得我们还能要走多远
How far do you think we're going to get?

559
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:40,700
总比你带她走得要远
A lot farther than you trying to carry her yourself.

560
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,500
好了听着
Okay, look.

561
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,930
我在想
I've been thinking.

562
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:46,500
我也许拿不掉跟踪仪
I may not be able to remove the tracking device,

563
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:49,560
但也许有办法让它运作不了
but there might be a way to disable it.

564
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:54,600
这机器...叫电击器
this machine... it's called a defibrillator.

565
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,530
它能产生强大的电流
It creates a powerful electric shock

566
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:59,430
使人的心脏恢复正常的韵律
to restore someone's heart to the proper rhythm,

567
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:00,560
所以我想
And I think,

568
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,760
如果我把两电极
If I can place the paddles

569
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,760
放在跟踪仪位置的皮肤上  来电击那么一下
on the skin directly above your tracking device,

570
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,600
我能让它加载过多的电量
I might be able to overload the power source.

571
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,900
烧坏电路
Fry the circuits.

572
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,430
好吧  就这么做
All right. Do it.

573
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:14,230
但是你要知道
Okay, but you should know

574
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:16,460
我可不保证能奏效
that there's no guarantees this is going to work,

575
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:19,160
同时  这还有很大的危险性
And it also carries a lot of risk.

576
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,530
但如果有用的话  那跟踪器就没用了
If it works, the device will be disabled.

577
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:25,300
如果我死了...还是一样
If it kills me... same thing.

578
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:28,960
幽灵人不能再追踪我了
The wraith won't be able to track me anymore.

579
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,860
是时候停止逃亡了
It's time to stop running.

580
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,860
不远了
It's not too much further.

581
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:45,160
你保证会照顾好她
Promise me you'll make sure she's cared for.

582
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,330
我保证
I promise.

583
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,700
好吧
Okay.

584
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,760
电荷从一个电极到另一个电极
The charge moves from one paddle to the other.

585
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,200
你身上的跟踪器
And your tracking device

586
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,260
正是在两个电极的正中间  好了吗
is going to be directly between them. okay?

587
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,830
好了
All right.

588
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,300
准备好了?
Ready?

589
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,960
好  我们开始了
Okay, here we go.

590
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,330
见鬼了
What the hell?

591
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:39,130
什么
What?

592
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,800
我不知道  只是...
I don't know, it just...

593
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,700
信号突然停了
suddenly stopped transmitting.

594
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,130
我们失去他们的联系了
We lost them.

595
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:53,200
快醒醒...
Come on...

596
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:04,860
你还好吗
You okay?

597
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:07,760
发生了什么
What-- what happened?

598
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,530
你心脏停了一会儿
I lost you for a moment.

599
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:12,700
但你还是回来了
But you're back in the land of the living.

600
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,060
它起作用了吗
Did it work?

601
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:19,800
我想是的
I think so.

602
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,930
跟踪仪不再传输信号了
The device isn't transmitting any signals.

603
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:26,000
我想我们把那鬼东西烧坏了
I think we successfully fried the sucker.

604
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:28,330
哦  不
Oh, no...

605
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:30,030
怎么了
What?

606
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:31,300
我想我们把它也烧坏了
I guess we fried that, too.

607
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,460
没关系
Doesn't matter.

608
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,560
我们不需要它了
Don't need it anymore.

609
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,630
事实上
Actually...

610
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:37,430
我认识个人
I know someone who would love

611
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:40,060
可能有兴趣研究这玩意儿
to inspect a gadget like that.

612
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:46,700
有什么发现没
Anything?

613
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,660
什么
What?

614
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:50,130
有人被拖过了这里
A body was dragged through here.

615
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,530
你发现了什么
You got something?

616
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:07,130
是啊  两个人曾经躺在这儿
Yeah. Two bodies laid here.

617
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:09,200
地上两个地方都被踩踏过
Ground cover's trampled in two spots.

618
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,160
就是说幽灵人比我们先找到他们了?
So the wraith got to them before we did?

619
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,560
我觉得不是
I don't think so.

620
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,760
我没有看到幽灵人的脚印
I don't see any wraith footprints anywhere.

621
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,060
那发生了什么事
Well, so what happened?

622
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,560
难道  他们相互杀了对方?
What, they killed each other?

623
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,630
没人死了
No one's dead.

624
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:20,730
至少在这里的时候没有
At least they weren't when they were here.

625
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:23,160
看  有人被拖过这里
Look. One body was dragged through here...

626
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,800
凯勒拖的  她的脚印
By keller-- her footprints.

627
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,830
所以是她杀了他
So she killed him.

628
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:27,930
在弄坏他的跟踪器的时候
Probably in the process of disabling his tracking device.

629
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:29,130
没有  她没杀他
Nah. She didn't kill him.

630
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:31,100
他那个时候昏过去了
He was unconscious.

631
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,800
他的脚印在她旁边
His footprints, side-by-side with hers,

632
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,400
朝那边走了
Leaving the clearing that way.

633
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,500
什么  她把昏迷的他拽到这里来
so, what, she brought him here unconscious,

634
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,260
救醒他  然后一起离开?
Revived him, and they left together?

635
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,260
照理是这样
looks like it.

636
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,760
慢着  你说这里有两个人躺着的痕迹
hey. wait a second. you said there were two bodies.

637
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,700
难道她在这里小憩片刻了吗
So, what, she took a nap?

638
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,600
不  另一个人的痕迹太小了  不是keller
no. too small for keller.

639
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,560
我猜  还有别的人跟他们在一起
My guess is someone else is with them.

640
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,700
或许是个孩子
Probably a child.

641
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:49,300
但没有留下脚印吗
but no footprints?

642
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,900
没有
no.

643
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,330
她是被背着过来的
She was carried here.

644
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:55,360
她?  你怎么知道她是个女孩
she? how could you possibly know the kid was a girl

645
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,360
幽灵人飞船
darts.

646
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,000
看来我们并不是唯一知道
looks like we're not the only ones

647
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,800
他的追踪信号消失了的人
Who noticed his signal died.

648
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:17,600
现在可以用上空间转移装置了
could sure use that teleportation device now.

649
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,530
下面不远处有一条小路下去
there's a path down not too far from here.

650
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:21,930
你在这等着
Stay here.

651
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:25,300
我下去看看  那还安不安全
I'll check to make sure it's still safe.

652
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,160
若楠  若楠  慢着
ronon! ronon, wait!

653
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,000
珍妮弗
jennifer!

654
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,900
叫他停手
make him stop!

655
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:41,800
什么  为何啊
what? why?

656
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,930
若楠  快停手
ronon, please! stop!

657
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:53,200
帮帮我  抱起她
help me. grab her!

658
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:54,760
停手
stop!

659
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,560
听着  他只是想我去救那小女孩
listen, he just wanted me to help the little girl.

660
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,360
她病了
She's sick!

661
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,430
性命垂危
She's dying.

662
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:05,560
若楠  我们要带她回亚特兰蒂斯
We need to get her back to atlantis. ronon!

663
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,530
拜托了
Please?

664
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:16,260
珍妮弗  那...那...
jennifer, the...the...

665
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,660
她的伤口又裂开了
her sutures have torn.

666
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:21,730
得重新缝合一下才能移动她
I need to restitch her before we can move her.

667
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:29,130
幽灵人到处追捕你
you got wraith looking for you.

668
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:30,960
我知道
i know.

669
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,300
听着  与其打个你死我活
listen, you stand a better chance

670
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,900
倒不如团结一致  对抗外敌
Fighting them together than fighting each other.

671
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,930
我是说  虽然这样突围的几率
I mean, obviously the odds of actually winning

672
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:37,300
也是微乎其微  但是
Are still ridiculously low, but...

673
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,130
说这话于事无补
not helping.

674
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:41,460
我要去...
I'm going to go...

675
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,560
他说得对
he's right.

676
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,060
幽灵人很快就蜂拥而至
This place is going to be swarming with wraith.

677
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,100
团结就是力量
it's better off if we work together.

678
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:04,060
好了  包扎好了
all right, she's ready.

679
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,230
走吧
let's go.

680
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,800
幽灵人
wraith!

681
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,760
妈的
oh, crap.

682
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:19,760
若楠
ronon!

683
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:33,300
开枪啊
shoot him!

684
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,330
这就来
i will!

685
00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:00,730
什么时候学会这些招数的
where'd you learn to fight like that?

686
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:04,260
他教了我几招格斗技
uh... been taking a few sparring lessons.

687
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:12,000
我们得转移了
we need to move.

688
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,600
我尝试稳定她的病情
i tried to stabilize her,

689
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,560
但是她必须要接受更强的药物治疗
But she needs stronger medication.

690
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,230
你要她帮你救人
you know, you could've just asked

691
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:18,230
你尽管开口就好了
For her assistance

692
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,230
也不至于要掳走她
As opposed to kidnapping her.

693
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,200
罗德尼  他知道的了
he knows, rodney.

694
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,030
有样东西要给你
Here, I got you something.

695
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:24,130
是个空间转移装置
It's a kind of teleportation device.

696
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:25,400
空间转移?  真的吗
teleportation? really?

697
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,730
是的  的确如此
well, it was, anyway.

698
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:28,730
不过我弄坏了
I kind of broke it.

699
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:32,900
她是你的家人吗
is she family?

700
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,460
我把幽灵人引到她的村子
i brought the wraith to her village.

701
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:38,100
她是唯一的幸存者
She's the sole survivor.

702
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:41,760
四处逃亡  不容易啊
it's not easy... living with that.

703
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,630
别担心
don't worry.

704
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,200
我们会帮助你们两个
We're going to get you out of this.

705
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,200
结束逃亡生涯的
Both of you.

706
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,400
下面有6个幽灵人
i count six wraith on the ground.

707
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,730
肉眼见到有6个没错
six that we can see.

708
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:13,360
可能还有些隐藏在丛林之中
Probably more in the surrounding woods.

709
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,200
要冒险一搏吗  杀出重围?
want to make a run for it? shoot our way through?

710
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,960
只要我们一开火  他们的飞船就会接收到信息
the ships will be alerted as soon as the shooting starts.

711
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,860
我们在拨号前就被抓了
We'll be culled before we can even dial.

712
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,330
无论如何  也要放手一搏
just going to have to take our chances.

713
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:25,430
你修好了
you fixed it!

714
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:27,060
我才不会修理  顶多弄一下
i don't know about "fixed," more of a patch.

715
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,430
这东西复杂得很
It's incredibly complicated technology.

716
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:30,130
我还不知道这能不能...喂
I'm not sure if it'll actually... hey!

717
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:31,430
你干什么
what're you doing?

718
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:34,860
我准备为突围加点胜算
i'm going to improve our chances.

719
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:40,930
别独自下去冒险啊
don't go down there by yourself.

720
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:42,360
没事的
i'll be fine.

721
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:45,200
准备进攻吧
Get ready to attack that clearing.

722
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,800
慢着  等一下  好吗
look, just-just-just wait a second, all right?

723
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,060
我不知道那东西是不是真的能用
I'm not sure if I actually fixed it.

724
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,460
用之前最好测试一下
You'll need to test it before you...

725
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:56,230
我猜  这该是修好了吧
I guess I did fix it.

726
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,530
他在星门那边
he's at the gate!

727
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:10,860
你们留着这里
stay with them.

728
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:34,130
他正在拨号
he's dialing the gate.

729
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,830
我们得继续前进
we've got to get a move on.

730
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:16,100
好的  让我抱她到星门那边
all right, well, we'll take her to the gate,

731
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,660
然后再回来
Then I'll go back,

732
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,460
告诉村民  这里已经安全可以回去
Tell people it's safe to return to the village.

733
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,660
不  不  它们飞上去了
uh, no, no, as they fly up,

734
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:36,130
你就要按这个键
You want to use that button there

735
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:37,330
射击它们
To shoot them.

736
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:39,400
射那些鸭子
shoot the ducks?

737
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,300
它们当然不是真的鸭子
they're not real ducks, obviously.

738
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,500
它们只是...假冒的
They're just, you know, for pretend...

739
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,960
或许她该玩别的游戏
maybe you should show her a different game.

740
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,060
是的  好的  这里
yeah. yeah, sure. here.

741
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:48,730
你的小病人怎么了
well, how's our little patient?

742
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:50,200
情况不错
oh, much better.

743
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,330
她很勇敢
She's a heck of a fighter.

744
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:53,560
他有烦着你吗
is he bothering you?

745
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:56,000
有的话  我可以强制他离开
Because I can have him removed. forcibly.

746
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,330
真的吗
really?

747
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:59,230
他开玩笑的
yeah. he's kidding.

748
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:01,200
我跟985星球中的一户人家谈过
i talked to one of the families on 985...

749
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,460
就是我们拜访过的那个女士的家
The woman's home we visited?

750
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,260
她很乐意收留西丽斯
She'd love to have celise come live with them.

751
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,700
太好了
that's great.

752
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,400
我还会再见到基里克吗
will I see kiryk again?

753
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,030
小甜心  我也不知道
i don't know, sweetheart.

754
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:14,900
我们也在找他
we're still looking for him.

755
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,860
用心留意他的行踪
Keeping our eyes and ears open.

756
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,200
我有样东西要给你
hey, I brought you something.

757
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:21,730
你在树林里丢下的
I think you dropped this in the woods...

758
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:24,260
娃娃
my doll.

759
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:42,000
怎么了
what?

760
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
好的
okay...

761
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,130
是这样的
Here's the thing.

762
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:45,630
我一直在想
I've been thinking.

763
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:48,730
我要知道你的企图
And, uh, I need to know your intentions.

764
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:50,300
企图?
intentions?

765
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,900
对珍妮弗的企图
with jennifer?

766
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,900
我没有任何企图
i don't have any intentions.

767
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,060
好吧
Okay.

768
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,630
很好
Good.

769
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:01,560
慢着
wait.

770
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:05,260
你说企图  是什么意思
what do you mean by "intentions?"

771
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:08,060
我是说  你是不是对她有...
i mean, are you interested in her in a...

772
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:10,760
好...感
Romantic... fashion?

773
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:13,730
没有
no.

774
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:15,600
很好
good.

775
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,260
慢着
wait.

776
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:19,730
怎么了
what?

777
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:22,300
或许我是
maybe I do.

778
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:24,600
有...企图
Have... intentions.

779
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,660
你有什么企图吗
do you have intentions?

780
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:29,100
当然了  所以我才来问你
yes, well, of course I do. that's why I was asking you.

781
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,930
那我们要怎么做
so what are we going to do about it?

782
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:33,330
我不知道
i don't know.

783
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:35,130
你大概是想我退出竞争吧
I won't fight you for her, if that's what you're thinking.

784
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:36,230
好极了
great!

785
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:37,630
我才不会把她拱手相让
i'm not going to step aside, either.

786
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:41,260
那...我们还是交由她去决定
So... we're just going to have to let her decide.

787
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:43,700
好的
okay.

788
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,860
好的
okay.

789
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,300
希望...强者能夺得芳心
so... may the best man win.
