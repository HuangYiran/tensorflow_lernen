1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:01,750
你爱上她了吧?
Are you in love with her?

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:03,750
喔! 才没有 别说了 爸
Whoa! No, shut up, Dad.

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,000
什么?      我要么作为自己去
What?        No, I either go as me

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,180
要么就不去了
or I'm not going at all.

5
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,190
不 滚开 想得美 蠢逼
No! Fuck off! Moron.

6
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,630
你不可能永远不认我的
You can't...you can't deny me for ever, you know.

7
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,680
我还就不认了
Well, denied, mate!

8
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:16,540
是移植的肺
It was the lung transplant.

9
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,880
给了我操掉别人超能力的能力
I've got the power to fuck powers out of people.

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,860
喂 喂 我有事跟你谈
Whoa! Whoa! I need to talk to you!

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,010
是关于一件毛衣的
It's about a jumper!

12
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:54,810
早安 费利
Morning, Finlay!

13
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:07,800
不是吧
Oh, come on!

14
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,790
我操 是真的
That's...that's fucking it.

15
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:17,760
他滚蛋了
He's fucked off!

16
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,890
他离开我了
He's left me!

17
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,770
鲁迪二号跑了 离开我了
Rudy 2's buggered off and left me!

18
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:24,520
他去哪了?      不知道 两天没见了
Where's he gone?        I don't know. He's been gone a couple of days.

19
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,250
我以为他会回来过夜 可他没回
I thought he might come back in the night, but he's not.

20
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,290
他头一次从我分离这么久
He's never been out of me this long before.

21
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,830
这是我的裤子吗?
Are they my trousers?

22
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:30,630
对 该死 抱歉
Yeah. Shit. I'm sorry.

23
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,050
我正要问你借点衣服
I was going to ask if I could borrow some clothes,

24
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,930
我没得穿了
because I've run out!

25
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,390
你打算怎么办?      操 我才不管呢
What you gonna do?        Fuck, I'm not gonna do nothing.

26
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,690
他想一个人去忙他的 随便他
If he wants go off and do his own thing, that's his decision.

27
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:43,440
谢天谢地 我说 终于自由了
Good riddance. That's what I say. Frigging free at last!

28
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,380

Thank fuck almighty, I'm free at last.         Don't...

29
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:47,960
快住手

33
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:32,700
大卫・西蒙斯 是我一个同学 他长了尾巴
David Simmonds, right? Now, he was a kid at our school. He had a tail.

34
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,220
就好像脊椎末端长了块没用的皮
It was like a useless flap of skin at the base of his spine.

35
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:40,140
终于有一天 他把尾巴摘掉了
And one day, he had the bloody tail removed.

36
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,800
那就是我现在的感觉
And now I know how he feels.

37
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,560
摘掉尾巴了 伙计们 我们干了吧
To losing your tail, guys. Let's get in there.

38
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,320
可他是我们的一员
But he was part of the gang.

39
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,440
得了吧
For fuck's sake!

40
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,510
你是史酷比 他是小皮(史酷比的侄子)
He was Scrappy-Doo to your Scooby.

41
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,300
你当然是夏奇(史酷比的饲主)
You're Shaggy. Obviously.

42
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,440
那我是哪个?
Um...which one am I?

43
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,190
薇玛      薇玛?
Velma.        Velma?

44
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,970

Mm.        With the glasses?

45
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,000
嗯      扯淡
Mm.        Fuck off.

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,330
要是他把自己弄死了呢?
What if he's killed himself?

47
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:01,170
他为啥要自杀啊 费恩?
W-Why the fuck would he have killed himself, Finn?

48
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,570
他也不想的
He didn't mean to.

49
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:06,480
吃着橘子 戴上狗项圈 捆紧点 再紧点
Satsuma in the mouth. Dog collar on. Bit tighter, bit tighter.

50
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,030
够了啊
Fuck's sake!

51
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:11,580
我走 我自己庆祝去 好了吧?
I'll piss off and I'll frigging celebrate by myself, shall I?

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,100

00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,110
你也滚草
Fuck you.

55
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,820
好好休息
Have a nice evening.

56
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,790
好白的屁股
That is a really pale arse.

57
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,040
你们干什么啊?
What the fuck, guys?

58
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,830
啊      好了
Aah!        OK.

59
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:47,570
老天 我怎么没在床上?
Christ sake! Why am I not in bed?

60
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,510
早安
Morning.

61
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,000
早安 啊
Morning! Ah!

62
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,780
这都怪鲁迪二号
This is...this is Rudy 2's fault!

63
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,110
我怎么能照顾自己呢
I cannot be expected to look after meself!

64
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,800
我才刚学会阿司匹林瓶盖要用拧的
I've only just worked out them screw-top lids on them aspirin bottles.

65
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,800
好了 你先把裤子穿上吧
OK. How about you just put some pants on first,

66
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,760
然后再说别的?
then we'll talk about it?

67
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,100
伙计 把手纸用完了我能理解
Mate, running out of bog roll is one fucking thing.

68
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,650
可这也太过分了
This is bang out of order.

69
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,050
气死我了
It makes my blood boil.

70
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:19,700
往前走两分钟就有垃圾站啊
I mean, there's a municipal recycling facility two minutes down the road.

71
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,750
真是渣滓
It's just scum.

72
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,030
没人性的渣滓
Sick, inhuman scum.

73
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,550
我们还杀人呢
We kill people.

74
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,290
没少杀
Frequently.

75
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:30,530
对
Yeah.

76
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,980
呃 杀人也很了不起的
Well, there's honour in killing people.

77
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,790
乱丢垃圾有个毛的技术含量啊?
There's no honour in fly-tipping, is there?

78
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:50,600
喂
Hey!

79
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,980
注意那个人
Check this guy out.

80
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,550
他没事吧
Is he all right?

81
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,750
你没事吧 伙计?
You all right, mate?

82
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,610
你还好吗?      他好像挺友好的?
How you doing?        Oh, he looks friendly, doesn't he?

83
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,870
你还好吧 没事吧你?
How you doing? You all right, mate?

84
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,950
哎哟 还挺缺爱呢
Oh, shit! He's a bit huggy.

85
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,180
两块糖 牛奶加两块糖
Two sugars. Milk and two sugars.

86
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:12,090
牛奶加两块糖 快给他倒杯茶...
Milk and two sugars! Get the man a cup of tea immediately bef...

87
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,790
我了个大操的
Oh, my fucking God.

88
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,330
是他 鲁迪二号
It's him! It's Rudy 2!

89
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,100
你去哪了 谁把你变成这样的?
Where have you been? Who's done this to you?

90
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,100
能肯定是他吗?
Are we absolutely sure it's him?

91
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,260
开什么玩笑? 看
Are you fucking kidding me, man? Look!

92
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,720
他看着有80了 可能还不止呢
He's got to be about 80. Maybe even more.

93
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:44,840
你记得出了什么事吗?
Do you remember what happened to you?

94
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,680
哦
Oh.

95
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:50,350
是你      对
It's you.        Yeah.

96
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,790
一直喜欢你
Always liked you.

97
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:57,540
下雨天 你的头发好漂亮
It's raining. Your hair's so pretty...

98
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,800
湿湿的好漂亮
when it's wet.

99
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:04,290
老天 这货真是个呆子
Jesus Christ. The man's a fucking vegetable.

100
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:07,440
我告诉你怎么回事 是风暴
I tell you what's happened here. The storm.

101
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:11,520
肯定跟风暴有关
This will be something to do with the storm.

102
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,390
真的?      对
Really?        Yeah.

103
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,860
你觉得是?      嗯
You think so?        Mm-hm.

104
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,840
多谢你的线索 马普尔小姐
Well, thanks for the heads-up, Miss Marple.

105
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,260
也许是因为
Maybe it's something to do

106
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,090
他去的那个超能力互助小组
with that super-power support group he's been going to.

107
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,740
他到底去那种小组干什么?
So, what does he need with a support group, anyway?

108
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,000
讲出你的感受 这是示弱的第一步
Talking about your feelings - first sign of weakness.

109
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,680
你应该闷在心里
You should bottle that up inside you

110
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,760
把愤恨憋成铁板一块
till it becomes a solid mass of anger and resentment.

111
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,230
我叔叔彼得就是这么做的
That's what my Uncle Peter did.

112
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,020
没错 他喝酒喝死了 可这不是重点
Admittedly, he drank himself to death, but that's not the...point.

113
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:39,940
喂?
Hello?

114
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,040
他饿了
He's hungry.

115
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,120
火腿 鸡蛋
Gammon and egg,

116
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:45,320
还有鱼 还有...
and fish and...

117
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,160
他要火腿
He wants gammon.

118
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,430
我也没办法 从售货机给他弄点东西
Well, I don't know. Get him some from a vending machine?

119
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,340
赶快
'OK, hurry up.'

120
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,410
这都应该是你的事 不是我的
You need to be the one dealing with this, not me.

121
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:54,930
哦
Oh...

122
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,780
各位 就是这里了      好
Guys, this is it.        Right.

123
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,100
什么计划?
What's the plan?

124
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,570
计划是...我们进去
The plan is...we go in there

125
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:07,630
问问谁把鲁迪二号变成了老头
and we ask 'em which one turned Rudy 2 into an old man.

126
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,750
什么烂计划      是吗?
Shit plan.        Is it?

127
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,470
如果鲁迪二号常来 他们会以为你是他
If Rudy 2's a regular at this group, they're going to think you're him.

128
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,340
进去卧底 假装成他
Go undercover, pretend to be him

129
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,170
凶手看见你一定会惊讶
and whoever did it'll be surprised to see you.

130
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,920
他们会自动暴露的
They'll give themselves away.

131
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,460
太天才了 我需要这些对吗?
That is genius. Here's what I need, right?

132
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,140
我需要假胡子 一副眼镜
I need a beard. I need some glasses.

133
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:26,200
我需要烟斗 斗篷 再找根拐棍
I need a pipe. I want a cloak. Get me a staff of some kind.

134
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,890
你需要像二号那样
You need to look like Rudy 2,

135
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,330
不然他们就不会以为你是他了
or they're not gonna think you're him.

136
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:33,240
这家伙 中考八门合格
This guy, eight GCSEs.

137
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:35,680
我们去卧底吧
Let's go undercover.

138
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,550
鲁迪二号 你近来可好?
Rudy 2. How you doing?

139
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:07,200
我想你们一定...见到我很惊讶吧
I would imagine you're... quite surprised to see me, guy.

140
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,050
也没有啊 你每周二都会来嘛
Not really. Um... you always come on a Tuesday.

141
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:13,520
只能说 老习惯成自然
Let's just say that old habits... die hard.

142
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:17,090
"老"习惯
OLD...habits.

143
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,400
我叫费恩      很高兴见到你 嗨
I'm Finn.        Nice to meet you. Hi.

144
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,650
别理我 我是来蹭饼干吃的
Oh, don't worry about me. I'm just here for the biscuits.

145
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:23,880
她确实是
She is.

146
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,440
你有什么能力?
So, what's your power?

147
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,640
隔空...      他会产奶
Teleke...        Milky nipples.

148
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,230
嗯?      产奶
Hm?        Milky nipples.

149
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:32,970
他只要一撒谎 乳头就出奶
Cos every time he tells a lie, he just expresses milk from his nipples.

150
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,560
太荒谬了 他很尴尬
It's ridiculous. He's very embarrassed about it.

151
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,550
抱歉失陪了
Now, you're going to have to excuse us,

152
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,660
我们还得跟其他人说话呢
cos we do have other people we need to speak to.

153
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,580
费利
Finlay.

154
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,810
什么叫他妈的产奶?
What was all that with the fucking milky nipples?

155
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:47,670
计划是怎样的 费恩 还记得吗?
What was the plan, Finn? Can you remember it?

156
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:52,290
计划是 我们不暴露真实的能力
The plan was, we don't tell anyone what our real powers are.

157
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,220
计划里没有这部分
That was nothing to do with the plan.

158
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,040
没有吗?      没有
Was it not?        No!

159
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,390
认真听我说 兄弟
Now, listen to me, dude, seriously.

160
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:02,160
这里有个人知道鲁迪二号的事 我建议分头找
Someone here knows something about Rudy 2. I suggest we just split up.

161
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,480
嗯 我觉得我们应该...      滚开
Yeah, I think we should just...       Fuck off.

162
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,500
为什么饼干旁边有只乌龟?
Why is there a turtle by the biscuits?

163
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:16,810
他每周都来 是个有超能力的人
He turns up every week. It's someone with a power.

164
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,160
这里面有个人?
There's someone inside of there?

165
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,730
对
Yeah.

166
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,440
他叫马克
His name's Mark.

167
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,860
你好啊 兄弟
All right, mate?

168
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,820
不用不好意思
You don't have to be embarrassed.

169
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,210
关于你的...能力
About your, um... Your power.

170
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,950
你呢 你的能力是什么?      我? 哦
How about you? What's... What's your power?        Me? Oh.

171
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:50,140
一言...难尽 我不想说
It's, er...it's complicated. I don't really like to talk about it.

172
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,160
没关系 不想说不勉强
It's all right. You don't have to, if you don't want to.

173
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,210
问题是 别的人...
The thing is, other people...

174
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:59,110
总是乱猜我的...
make certain assumptions about my...

性取向 而且...
...sexuality, and...

176
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:04,560
怎么 他们以为你是同性恋?
What, they... They think you're gay?

177
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,550
对 我觉得他们是这么以为的
Yeah, yeah. I...I guess they do.

178

不是
No!

180

现在你知道了
Now you know.

Fuck off!

182
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:35,170
你... 你真的出不了柜了
You're... You're literally trapped in the closet?

183

How does he take powers? How does it work?

189

00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:50,270
你是亚历克斯吗?
Are you Alex?

268
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:52,910
你朋友说你能移除超能力
Your mate said you'd take my power.

269
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,170
什么朋友?
What mate?

270
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,580
乳头会产奶那个
Your mate with the milky nipples.

271
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,230
抱歉 谁?      矮个子的
What? Sorry?        He was short.

272
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:02,320
哦 费恩 小猴崽子
Oh, Finn. You monkey-faced fuck.

273
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,040
呃 请别介意 但我不帮男的
Er...look, no offence, mate, but I don't really do blokes.

274
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,650
这是什么意思?
What's that supposed to mean?

275
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,750
就是我不想和男人上床
It means I'm not into having sex with men.

276
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,790
你以为我是基佬?
What, you think I'm gay?

277
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,420
我不管你是什么
I don't really care what you are.

278
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,970
听着 我才不是基
Look, I'm not gay!

279
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:21,060
就是这里 她叫玛吉
This is it. Her name's Maggie.

280
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,240
好吧 玛吉
All right, Maggie.

281
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,980
出来混总是要还的 婊子
It's time to pay the fucking piper, biatch.

282
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,200
我操
Bosh!

283
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,850
你干什么?
What are you doing?

284
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,160
我以为这是计划的一部分
Well, I thought it was part of the plan!

285
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,520
我们直接敲门就好
We could have just knocked.

286
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:37,470
没时间敲门了 费利 还要我说出来吗
It's too late to frigging knock now, Finlay, for crying out loud!

287
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:40,720
没时间敲门了吧?
IS it too late to knock?

288
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:45,370
操 我现在敲吧 看她怎么说
Shit, I'm just gonna knock, man, see what she's saying.

289
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,320
有人吗?
Yoo-hoo?

290
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:51,170
她来了 我怎么说?
Here she comes. What do I say?

291
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,620
说对不起
Say sorry.

292
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,920
你好吗 亲爱的?
All right, love?

293
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:58,290
你为什么打破我的门?
Why did you break my door?

294
00:16:58,710 --> 00:16:59,570
因为我...
Because I...

295
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,200
我以为你摔倒了...
I thought you'd fallen...over...

296
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,830
扭了腰
..and broken your hip.

297
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,730
来帮我把拼图拼了 然后把锁修好
Well, you can fix that lock when you've helped me with my jigsaw.

298
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,930
哦 上帝
Oh...God.

299
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:19,960
我有只猫
I have a cat.

300
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,340
她可能会想吃你的奶
She may try to drink from your nipples.

301
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:32,670
你干什么?      合不上啊
What are you doing?        It just fucking won't fit.

302
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:35,930
首先要找到边 再朝里推进
You need to find the edges first, work from the outside in.

303
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,900
这是常识      哦 拜托...
Basic puzzling.        Oh, just...

304
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,120
拼你的拼图 兄弟
the jigsaw, man.

305
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,760
我去卧底了
I'm going undercover.

306
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,240
问问她知道什么
I'm going to see what she knows.

307
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,180
好吗?      好
Yeah?        Yes.

308
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:58,220
所以 玛吉
So...Maggie.

309
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:04,370
你一定... 没想到会见到我吧
I suppose you're... quite surprised to see me.

310
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:05,430
不是吗?
Aren't you?

311
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:08,250
今天周三 你每周三都来
It's Wednesday. You always come Wednesday.

312
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,340
手伸出来
Hands.

313
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,040
哦
Oh...

314
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,030
所以...
So...

315
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:18,290
那个混蛋鲁迪一号最近对你如何?
how's that awful Rudy 1 treating you?

316
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:22,050
他不是混蛋 他就... 就是有点被误会
He's not awful. He's just... He's a bit misunderstood, that's all.

317
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,610
我说多少遍了 你该离开他
You should leave him. I'm sick of telling you.

318
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:26,220
也许他需要我
Well, maybe he needs me.

319
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,810
也许他该学着照顾自己了
And perhaps it's time he learnt to look after himself.

320
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,710
恕我直言
Well, with all due respect,

321
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:35,000
也许你他妈该学会少管闲事 玛格丽特
perhaps it's time you minded your own fucking beeswax, Margaret.

322
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,630
我不喜欢你今天的腔调 鲁迪二号
I don't think I care for your tone today, Rudy 2.

323
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,440
对不起 我不该骂人
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have sworn.

324
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,220
去卧室
Bedroom.

325
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,510
把浅粉色线团拿来
There's a ball of pale pink.

326
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,750
快去呀
Well, go on.

327
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,100
耶
Yes.

328
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,100
四角找全了
All four corners.

329
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,320
哼
Huh.

330
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,610
这都是有意义的
They all mean something.

331
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:26,990
是什么呢?
Who knows what?

332
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,220
他们总会知道的
They'll find out eventually.

333
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,210
谁会?
Who will?

334
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,300
毛衣上的人
The people on the jumpers.

335
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,290
这是他们的未来
It's their future.

336
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,860
你该走了
You'd better be going.

337
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,100
你周三不是还要见提姆吗?
Don't you usually meet up with Tim on a Wednesday?

338
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:43,970
哦 提姆 当然
Oh! Tim! Course I do!

339
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:46,190
提姆 提姆可不等人 没错
Tim...Tim. Tim waits for no man, as it t'were.

340
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,630
不过说真的
Seriously, though.

341
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:50,910
我行事历丢了 我忘了
I've mislaid my old Filofax. Can't remember.

342
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:52,880
在哪见提姆来着?
Where exactly do I meet Tim?

343
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,730
她能织出预言
She knits the future.

344
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:58,070
真是非传统的能力啊 是吧?
It's not exactly your classic super-power, is it?

345
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,030
嗨
Hey.

346
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:02,710
我得跟你谈谈
I need to talk to you.

347
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:04,690
哦
Oh.

348
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,500
所以
So...

349
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:13,140
提姆? 我想...你见到我一定很意外吧
Tim? I suppose you're, er... quite surprised to see me.

350
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,100
我们单独谈一分钟
Give us a minute.

351
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,450
别走 你去哪 兄弟? 坐这别动
Stay. Where you going, dude? Stay there.

352
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,290
提姆 提姆?
Tim? Tim?

353
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:27,130
又发生了      嗯?
It happened again.        Hm?

354
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:29,420
我今早醒来 发现了这个
I woke up this morning and I found this.

355
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:35,160
哦我操... 你是不是... 这是枪哎
Oh, for fuck... Do you...? What? Fucking gun!

356
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,260
我不知道哪来的 反正肯定没好事
I don't know where it came from, but it can't be good.

357
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,370
帮帮我
Help me.

358
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:43,140
求你 告诉我该怎么办
Just please tell me what to do.

359
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:50,550
好吧 不是我要告诉你该怎么办
All right, instead of me telling you what I think you should do,

360
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:55,050
也许你该告诉我 你打算怎么办 提姆
maybe you should tell me what YOU think you should do, Tim.

361
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:59,210
我得弹一下手环
I need to snap the band.

362
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,370
提醒自己 这是现实
Remind myself that this is real.

363
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,850
这不是游戏
That it's not a game.

364
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,870
好主意 那就弹吧
Cool. Well, then, just snap it.

365
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,680
弹手环 提醒你自己这是现实 然后...
You snap the band, remind yourself it's real and...

366
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,180
怎么了 哥们?
Well, what, dude?

367
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,030
什么...
What...?

368
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,660
什么情况? 你有点紧张啊
What's the matter, dude? You're getting a bit twitchy.

369
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,070
别拿出来 我操拜托 快拿开
Let's not get that out... For fuck's sake, put it away.

370
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,450
他们会报警的
They'll ring the fucking police.

371
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,110
不不不 我操 拜托

373
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:31,810
快他妈弹手环 提姆 快给我弹
Fucking snap the band, Tim. Snap the fucking band!

374
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:34,010
快他妈弹手环 快他妈弹手环
Snap the fucking band. Snap the fucking band.

375
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:36,690
把枪收回包里去
Put the fucking gun in the bag.

376
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:41,330
老兄 快把枪收起来 老天在上 提姆 我操
Dude, put the fucking gun in the bag. For Christ's sake, Tim! Shit!

377
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:44,950

Thanks.

378

00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,670
你真是个好朋友
You're a good friend.

380
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:51,710
你也不坏 费利 把那玩意喝掉
You're not so bad yourself. Finlay, dude, drink that shit up.

381
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,060
他到底为啥帮这些人?
Why the fuck does he help these people?

382
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,730
他连说都没说过 他谁也没告诉
And he doesn't even go on about it, he doesn't tell anyone.

383
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:00,830
我捐了2毛钱给抗癌中心 至今我还挂在嘴边
I?I gave 20p to Cancer Research. I'm still going on about it.

384
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,820
你没事吧?      我有件事要做
Are you all right?        There's something I need to do.

385
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,690
我回头打给你      好
I'll call you later.        OK.

386
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:19,710
他在这儿呢
Here he is.

387
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:21,290
狡猾的银狐狸 你去哪...
The silver fox, where...

388
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:23,670
我操
Shit!

389
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:25,300
你把他关壁橱里了
You locked him in a fucking cupboard!

390
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,310
哼 理论上讲那不是壁橱
Huh. Well, technically, that's not a cupboard.

391
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,910
那是个储藏室啊 对吧?
That's a bloody storeroom, innit?

392
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:31,410
不 这不是开玩笑
No, this isn't a fucking joke.

393
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,700
我就走开五分钟
It was only five minutes while I was...

394
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,480
所有事都要我管 所以...
I was taking care of everything. So...

395
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,720
你走开五分钟去撒尿我也不管
I don't care if it's for five minutes while you go for a piss.

396
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,990
好吧 老天啊 我道歉好不好
All right. Jesus Christ, I'm fucking sorry, like.

397
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:41,170
你看看他
Look at him!

398
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:42,940
你看看他
Look at him!

399
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:45,150
这不是玩笑
This is not a joke!

400
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,580
这不是生活中一点小麻烦
This is not some minor inconvenience to your day!

401
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:51,170
这不是外人
It's not some random old man!

402
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,640
他是鲁迪二号 你的一部分
He's Rudy 2 and he's a part of you!

403
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:58,230
好吧
All right.

404

Don't be sad.

408

哦 我好累

去睡一觉吧 我去弄我们的晚餐
Go and get some bloody shut-eye. I'll go and get our dinner.

我没打算变成这样的
I didn't mean for it to happen like this.

416

我一辈子都在等待这种感觉
I've waited my whole life to feel this way...

418
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:41,770
现在我得到了她 我...

I'm here now and I won't leave you.

435
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:33,540
好吧 在我找到办法把他复原之前
Now then, until I can figure out how to get him back to normal,

436
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,140
我们得轮流照看他
we're all gonna take turns helping,

437
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,670
所以我列了个简单的轮班表
so I've drawn out a simple rota system.

438
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,250
按颜色标明 手写的
That's colour-coded and handwritten.

439
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:42,340

448
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:06,070
他也照料过你们每个人

动起来吧 各位
Let's do this. Come on, guys.

452
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:34,040
# 我听说了昨晚的好消息

455
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:50,490
# 对 我真高兴 有这些好消息

456
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:54,490
# 昨晚的好消息
# That's happened last night

457
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,330
# 所以别惊讶
# So don't you marvel

458
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:03,040
# 这些事注定要发生
# These things must come to pass... #

459
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,070
亚历克斯 帮我个小忙好吗?
Um...Alex, will you do me a quick favour?

460
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,520
能不能操我的乌龟?
Will you fuck my tortoise?

461
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,700
给我一分钟 考虑一下
Um...just give me a minute to think about...that.

462
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:18,220
实际上 用不了一分钟 答案是不行
Er...actually, I don't need a full minute. It's a no.

463
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:21,870
这是个人 他叫马克
It's a man and his name's Mark.

464
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:23,890
他被困在里面 没法逃脱
He's trapped in here and he can't get out.

465
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:26,890
真是悲剧啊      嗯
That is really tragic.        Mm.

466
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:29,030
可我还是不会操你的乌龟
But I'm still not fucking your tortoise.

467
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,460
你根本不理解 对吗?
You have no idea, do you?

468
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,920
我知道了我的超能力 一点用都没有
I found out what my power is and it's totally useless.

469
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,130
根本谁也帮不了
There's nothing I can do to help anyone.

470
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:39,330
可你 你能作出改变
But you... You can make a difference.

471
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,640
我们中只有你能改变别人的人生
You're the only one out of us who can actually change people's lives.

472
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:47,400
可你做了什么呢? 袖手旁观
And what are you doing about it? Nothing.

473
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:50,370
坐在那一动不动
It's just sat there in your pants.

474
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,910
把超能力用起来 亚历克斯
Use your power, Alex.

475
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:54,700
帮助别人
Help people.

476
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,280
做个超级英雄
Be a superhero.

477
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,710
操了这只乌龟吧 亚历克斯
Fuck the tortoise, Alex.

478
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,460
齐活了 你看

479
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:11,130
干净衣服 随你怎么弄脏

480
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,470
给你吧 我们来...
There you go. All right, let's get...

481
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,730
你穿的什么东西?
What the frigging hell are you wearing?

482
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:19,810
毛衣 玛吉给我织的
My jumper. Maggie made it for me.

483
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,340
他说冷 我在沙发底下找到的
He was cold. I found it under the sofa.

484
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:25,680
这他妈是我啊 是我啊 我在飞 你看
That's fucking me! That's me! I'm fucking flying! Look!

485
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,590
你说什么?
What you talking about?

486
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:29,480
这是未来的我 我就知道 我就知道
It's the future. That is me, that. I fucking knew...I knew it!

487
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,110
哦 这只是件毛衣
Oh, it's just a jumper.

488
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,850
那个女人能织出预言 这是我们 瞧
This woman, she knits the future. That is us, look.

489
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:35,920
好吧 怎么只有四个人?
All right. How comes there's only four of us?

490
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,320
肯定漏了费恩
She had to miss Finn out, obviously.

491
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,380
那么小的人怎么织啊?
No-one can knit that fucking small, can they?

492
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:46,600
我们送他上床睡觉吧 手举起来
Let's get him... Let's get him ready for bed. Hands in the air.

493
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,630
哦吼
Woo-hoo!

494
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:49,510
给你整整领子
Let me just sort your collar out.

495
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:52,040
好了 衣服脱下来 准备好了吗?
Right, let's get this off. Are you ready?

496
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:55,090
他去哪了 他去哪了?
Where's he gone? Where's he gone?

497
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:57,160
天啊 他去哪了? 在这儿呢
Oh, my God, where's he gone? There he is.

498
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,010
好了      给他讲讲巧克力的事
Right.       Oh, tell him about the chocolate.

499
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:01,170
什么巧克力?
What chocolate?

500
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:03,250
皮座椅 你去海边的时候
The leather seats. You were going to the seaside.

501
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,850
巧克力化在座椅上了
Chocolate all over seats.

502
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:08,280
我爸的车 皮座椅
Me dad's car with the leather seats.

503
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,350
哦 闭嘴 没人爱听这个 无聊死了
Oh, shut up, man. No-one wants to hear about that. It's boring.

504
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:12,600
不 我就爱听
No. I like it.

505
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,220
是焦糖夹心巧克力棒
It was a...a Curly Wurly.

506
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:20,580
我把它放在...短裤屁股兜里
And I put it in my back pocket of my... Of my shorts.

507
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:24,060
我坐在上面 从家里一直坐到公路上
And I sat on it all the way from home until the motorway.

508
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:26,330
那个假期可开心了
That were a bloody brilliant holiday!

509
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:29,030
我不记得... 你知道吗 我都忘了
I can't... D'you know, I forgot about that.

510
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:33,660
我把我的小坦克埋在海滩上
Er...I buried me tank on t'beach.

511
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:35,270
我操 那坦克
The fucking... The tank.

512
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:38,450
我最爱的坦克 过生日别人送的 对吧?
I got... I loved that tank. I got it for my birthday, didn't I?

513
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:42,340
妈妈和爸爸把海滩挖了个遍
Me mam and dad, they dug up the whole beach,

514
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,040
怎么也找不到
but they couldn't find it.

515
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,480
15年后 他们回去 回到原来的海滩 对吧?
15 years later, they went back, didn't they, to t'same beach?

516
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,300
他们吃着三明治
They were eating their sandwiches...

517
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:56,510
那里有个男孩
..and there was a boy.

518
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:59,390
正在挖洞
He was making a hole.

519
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,050
挖到了我的坦克 我的小坦克又回来了
They found my tank. I got my bloody tank back.

520
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,970
你要看电视吗?
Do you want to watch TV?

521
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,860
好      好吗?
Er...yeah.        Yeah?

522
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,200
就这么办      好
Yeah, all right, then.        Good.

523
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,320
我去拿薯片好不好? 行
I'll get the crisps, shall I? All right?

524
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:28,710
讽刺的是 为了让我拿走你的能力
The irony is that for me to take your power,

525
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:31,550
为了让你从柜里出来
and for you to stop being trapped in closets,

526
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,890
我们得来次肛交
we need to have anal sex.

527
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,070
嗯
Mm.

528
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:41,160
事先说清楚 我和你上床是因为你不是基
Just so we're clear, am I fucking you because you're not gay

529
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,590
而且想移除你的超能力?
and you're just sick of having your power?

530
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,720
还是因为你就是基
Or am I fucking you because you are gay

531
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:49,760
却不想被别人知道?
and you just don't want anyone to know about it?

532
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,560
有点难回答
It's a head-scratcher.

533
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:56,750
是因为我爸
It's my dad.

534
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:00,970
他不接受我
He won't accept me.

535
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:02,600
那他是个傻逼
Well, then, he's a dick.

536
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,090
有问题的是他 不是你
He's the one who needs helping, not you.

537
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:11,540
我该走了
I should go.

538
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:23,070
不想有空一起喝一杯?
I don't suppose you'd fancy a drink some time?

539
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:33,560
尽管交配已经结束
'And though their mating is now over,

540
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:37,320
雄性却会开始审视其交媾行为
'the male will often begin to review his amorous...'

541
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,240
额 你在干什么?      没什么
Eurgh. What you doing?        N-Nothing.

542
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,940
该死 对不起 我以为...是他的脖子
Shit. I'm sorry. I just thought... I thought it was his neck.

543
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:47,770
从皮毛中捉出虱子 于是...
'..picking fleas and tics out of his fur and so...'

544
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,290
好啦 你个二逼 快喝掉
Right, come on, you, buggerlugs, drink up.

545
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:53,750
"新居大改造"要开始了 快去看啊
Homes Under The Hammer's about to start. Let's have it.

546
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,220
来吧 可别错过了 对不对?
Come on. We don't want to miss that, do we?

547
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,950
你干什么?      我觉得他心脏病犯了
What are you doing, man?        I think he's having a heart attack.

548
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:02,990
我们怎么办? 操
What do we do? Fuck!

549
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,830
快来人啊
Somebody help!

550
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:07,100
快来人啊      吸气
Somebody help!        Breathe!

551
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,260
上帝耶稣老天爷啊 怎么办?
Jesus fucking Christ! What do we do?

552
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,190
退后
Stand back.

553
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:13,170
你是医生吗?      我是电工
Are you a doctor?        I'm an electrician.

554
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:15,020
他没呼吸了
He's not fucking breathing!

555
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:19,310
清除
Clear!

556
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:20,990
哦操
Oh, shit.

557
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:23,290
你没事吧 兄弟?
Are you all right, mate?

558
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:24,590
你没事吧?
Are you all right?

559
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,210
你没事吧?      他没事
Are you all right?        He is.

560
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:38,210
没关系 哥们 我在这 没关系了
It's all right, man, I'm here now. It's all right, bud.

561
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:40,430
谢谢 谢谢你
Thanks. Thank you.

562
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:41,480
把他扶起来
Get him up.

563
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,280
费恩陪着他 他睡着了
Finn's with him. He's gone off to sleep.

564
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,920
他会死的 对吗?
He's gonna die, isn't he?

565
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:15,030
不是... 不是现在
Not... Not now.

566
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,890
很快
Soon.

567
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,560
我会变成孤身一人
And I'm going to be all on my own.

568
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:27,040
等我变成这样 谁来照顾我呢?
Who's going to look after me when I get like that?

569
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,780
也许你会遇见合适的人 成家 生子
Maybe you'll meet someone, settle down, have kids.

570
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:31,880
像普通人那样
Like a normal person.

571
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,630
谁会乐意和我成家?
Who'd want to settle down with me?

572
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,270
嗯?
Hm?

573
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:43,200
我爷爷老了之后 我们给他找了个疗养院
When my grandad got old, we found him a home.

574
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:46,090
他在那挺开心的
He was happy there.

575
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,760
也许这是他最好的归宿
Maybe it's the best thing for him.

576
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:52,760
对大家都好
For everyone.

577
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,880
会有人照顾他 你想看他就去看
They'll look after him. You can visit him when you like.

578
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:01,850
对
Yeah.

579
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:05,980
你会跟我们一起去吗?
Will you come with us?

580
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,770
我当然会
Of course I will.

581
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:28,800
我们只用给你弄台电视 几张海报
All we need t'do is get you a bloody TV. Couple of posters.

582
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,260
这可是单身公寓啊 瞧瞧 里外套间
It's a fucking bachelor pad. That's what this... Look at this. En suite.

583
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,230
还有撒尿的池子
Cheeky wee in the sink.

584
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:36,410
如果你凌晨四点想吃火腿鳄梨三明治
And if you fancy a ham and avocado sandwich at four in the morning,

585
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:39,290
还有客房服务 随叫随到
you got your room service there, cheeky tug.

586
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:41,290
他来了 他来看我了
He came. H-He came to see me.

587
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:43,470
喂 听我说
Oi, listen to me.

588
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,100
我会来看你的
I'LL come and see you.

589
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,340
我会早也来 晚也来
I'm gonna be here so often,

590
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,600
直到你见我就想吐
you're gonna be sick of the friggin' sight of me.

591
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,210
我马上就回来看你
I'll see you soon.

592
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,480
怎样?
Yeah?

593
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,790
好吗?
All right?

594
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,160
我们走吧 去新的地方
Let's just get away. We'll go somewhere.

595
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,210
从头开始
Start again.

596
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,170
去哪?
Where?

597
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,980
我不知道 去哪都行
I don't know. Anywhere.

598
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:33,300
这里有我太多的回忆
There's too many memories for me here.

599
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:35,390
或者
Or...

600
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,610
不如我们
..how about

601
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,320
哪也不去
we don't go anywhere...

602
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:45,350
就去喝一杯?
and we just go for a drink instead?

603
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:10,440
我又去你的互助组了 什么也没问出来
I went back to your group. No-one knows anything.

604
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:13,390
操 对不起 兄弟 我尽力了
Shit, I'm...I'm sorry, man. I tried.

605
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:17,920
可我后来又去了爸妈家
You know, but then I went to Mum and Dad's house

606
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:19,780
给你带了个礼物
and I've got you a present.

607
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,260
怎样?
Eh?

608
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,250
哦 对
Oh, yeah.

609
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,630
他们翻遍了整个海滩
They dug up the whole beach.

610
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:34,070
他们正吃着三明治...
They were having their sandwiches...

611
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:35,830
没错
They did.

612
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:38,540
你留着 好吗?
I want you to have it, yeah?

613
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:42,550
你? 我没想到你会来
You? I wasn't expecting to see you.

614
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:46,940
是吗 为什么? 抱歉 为什么没想到?
Really? Why? Sorry, why might that be?

615
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,470
强森先生不在这了 他走了
Mr Johnson isn't here any more. He's gone.

616
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:55,240
对不起 我... 我行事历丢了
I'm sorry, I just...I seem to have mislaid the old Filofax.

617
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,420
你说的哪个强森先生?
Which Mr Johnson do you mean?

618
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:59,420
因为我常来看的有好几个 所以...
Cos I help a few on a regular basis, that's all, so...

619
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:03,140
伦・强森 我真的很担心他
Len Johnson. I'm really worried about him.

620
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:08,170
我们查了所有医院 就是找不到他
We've tried all the hospitals, but there's no sign of him.

621
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,480
谢谢
Thanks

622
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:42,080
(伦・强森)

623
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,820
没事的
It's OK.

624
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:31,050
不用惊慌
There's no need to panic.

625
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,590
我们要在一起了
We're going to be together.

626
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:43,100
我和娜奥米
Me and Naomi.

627
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,300
我知道你会为我们高兴的
I know you'd be happy for us.

628
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,190
可我不能冒险让你毁了一切
But I can't risk you ruining everything.

629
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,730
你要把他怎样?
What the fuck are you doing to him, man?

630
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,380
他是我的朋友
He's my friend.

631
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,580
我的超能力 可以和人互换年龄
My power. I can swap ages with people.

632
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:33,600
鲁迪二号愿意每周和我互换一小时
Rudy 2 used to let me switch with him for an hour a week

633
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,910
让我享受一下年轻的滋味
just to give me a break from being an old man.

634
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,910
我对她一见钟情
I loved her from the minute I saw her.

635
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:50,710
娜奥米

00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:53,930
我的护士
She was my nurse.

637
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,080
我终生没结婚 我...
I never got married. I...

638
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,820
一直没能找到真爱 直到今天
..never found my true love... until now.

639
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:03,060
如果我告诉她你的行为呢?
What if I was to tell her what you've been doing?

640
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,540
如果我给他看你的照片会怎样?
What if I showed her the photo of you?

641
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:10,100
那时她就明白了 你是怎样的人
Cos then she'd see you for what you really are.

642
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,820
求你别告诉她
Please don't tell her.

643
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:16,340
你还好吧 兄弟?
You all right, mate?

644
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:18,360
没事了 兄弟
It's all right, mate.

645
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,680

647
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,340
快动手 不然我就告诉她一切
Do it or I'll tell her everything.

648
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:34,900
握住他的手 好了
Take his hand. It's all right.

649

00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:21,900
你得好好谢谢我了 年轻人 对不对?
I believe a thanks is in order, innit, young man? Ha-ha-ha!

654
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,330
你把我关壁橱里了
You locked me in a cupboard.

655
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:25,420
那才不是壁橱 那是储藏室
No, it wasn't a cupboard, it was a storeroom,

656
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:27,980
我还给你擦屁股 喂你吃黄油糖
and I wiped your arse and I gave you butterscotch

657
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,950
还让你看他妈的斯诺克
and I let you watch the friggin' snooker.

658
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:32,860
我不爱看斯诺克      忘恩负义的东西
I don't like the snooker.        You ungrateful fucker!

659
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:35,360
我开玩笑的 你做得挺好
Nah, I'm only kidding. You did great.

660

所以 你帮我勾搭的那个基佬
So...about that gay guy that you hooked me up with.

664
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,100

Oh! Yeah.        Oh, yeah(!)

665
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,680
我得说声谢谢
I just wanted to say thanks.

666
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:06,290
帮助别人的感觉不错
It felt good helping somebody.

667
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:10,200
你知道吗 我觉得这就是我超能力的用法
You know, I think this is what I'm supposed to do with my power.

668
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:13,710
做个... 真正的英雄
You know, be like a... A proper hero.

669
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:16,670
都得谢谢你 嗯?
And all thanks to you, eh?

670
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:19,360

Yeah, pleasure.

671
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:22,260

So, hang on. Now you're into helping people, would you...?

672
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,190
不行 还是不操你的乌龟
No. I won't shag your tortoise.

673
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:31,870
早安 马克 你睡得好吗?
Morning, Mark. Did you sleep well?

674
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:45,610
回头见
(See you later.)

675
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:56,920
你还好吗?      嗯
You all right?        Mm.

676
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,740
我有点想他 是不是很奇怪?
Is it weird that I miss him?

677
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,970
照顾人的感觉挺好的
It was nice having someone to look after.

678
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:13,190
不 我不觉得奇怪
No, I don't think it's weird.

679
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:20,690
知道吗? 如果我不是这么个混蛋 我会...
Do you know what? If I wasn't such a total fuck-up, I'd...

680
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:23,790
我大概会约你喝一杯 你会答应的
I'd probably ask you out for a drink and you'd say yeah

681
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:27,640
因为 我不会是你现在看到的这个混蛋
because, well, I wouldn't be the mess that stands before you now.

682
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,610
我会是...另一个人 你知道 一个...
I'd be... I'd be someone different, you know, someone...

683
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:33,820
一个好人
You know, someone good.

684
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:38,410
我们会在一起度过特别开心的时光
And we'd end up having this really amazing time together and...

685
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,510
也许... 也许还会变成男女朋友
I dunno, we might even end up as boyfriend and girlfriend.

686
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:48,620
也许最后 我也不会把一切搞成一团糟
And it wouldn't end up with me just fucking it up all the time

687
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:50,720
在你眼里变成个人渣
and you thinking I'm a total cunt.

688
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,850
绝对不会那样的 结果会很圆满
It wouldn't be like that at all. It'd be nice.

689
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,360
我们会幸福地... 在一起
And we'd be happy...together.

690
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,790
我不知道
And, I don't know, fucking hell,

691
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:02,530
没准有一天 我们还会养个狗什么的
one day we might even get a dog or summat.

692
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:11,270
那好吧
All right, then.

693
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:15,830
什么好吧?
All right, then, what?

694
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:21,210
你刚请我喝一杯 我答应了
You just asked me out for a drink and I said yes.

695
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:27,000
好吧
Yeah.

696
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:30,390
嗯
Huh.

697
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:35,290
萨姆 萨姆
Sam. Sam.

698
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:36,560
我想给你看点东西
I wanna show you something.

699
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:46,520
那是我吗?
Is that me?

700
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,470
对 我觉得是
Yeah. I think so.

701
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:52,520
下面这个带闪电的女孩
And this girl down here with the lightning bolts.

702
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,500
我犯了心脏病 被她救了
I had an heart attack. She saved my life.

703
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:57,410
楼顶上这个是谁?
Who's that on top of the building?

704
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,960
我不知道      也许是你
I don't know.        Maybe it's you.

705
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:06,120
说不定我们都能成为超级英雄?
What if we all become superheroes?

706
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,710
我是说 真正的...
I mean, like, you know, proper...

707
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:12,760
超级英雄
superheroes.

708
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:18,910
也许这才是我们的宿命
Maybe it's our destiny.

莉亚?
Lia?

722
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:15,650
我觉得她对我做了什么
'I...I think she did something to me.'

723
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:19,630
你干什么的?      监督官
What do you do?        Probation worker.

我叫莉亚
I'm...I'm Lia.

It was you, wasn't it?

728
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:34,540
我能不能 我要说句话...
Can I just...? Let me just say, in my...

729
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:35,830
我要为自己说句话... 啊
Let me just say in my defence...

730

是她 她下载进了亚历克斯
