00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,190
没有什么能比得上戈德堡家的感恩节 
There was nothing quite like Thanksgiving in the Goldberg house.

6
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,570
我妈妈全心全意地准备
My mom gave it her heart and soul,

7
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:07,080
她所想要的回报只是 
and all she wanted in return

8
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:08,850
她的家人都坐在桌子旁
was her family to sit around the table

9
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,200
感谢...她 
and give thanks... to her.

10
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,560
好了 火鸡烤好了 洋芋也加了糖稀
Okay, turkey's been basted, and the yams are marshmallowed.

11
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:17,030
大功告成
My job is done.

12
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,910
也许现在该你们行动起来了
Maybe it's time for you to do your jobs

13
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,790
在接下来几个小时里好好想想 
and spend the next few hours thinking about

14
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,170
你最感谢的人或者事是什么
the thing or person that you're most thankful for.

15
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,130
邦・乔维的美臀
Bon Jovi's ass.

16
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,130
{\an8}乐队歌手

17
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:26,040
达里尔・道金斯
Darryl Dawkins.

18
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:26,040
{\an8}NBA传奇中锋

19
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:27,180
哈里森・福特
Harrison Ford.

20
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:27,180
{\an8}美国著名影星 作品《夺宝奇兵》《星球大战》等

21
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,370
他是印第安纳・琼斯 韩・索罗
He's Indiana Jones, Han Solo,

22
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,370
{\an8}分别为福特在夺宝奇兵和星球大战中的角色

23
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,540
鲜为人知的是 他是个训练有素的木匠
and--little-known fact-- he's a trained carpenter.

24
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:31,790
他能给我们做一个凉亭
He can make us a gazebo.

25
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,020
出去了 去换好衣服
Everyone out. Go get dressed

26
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,000
想想你们的答案
and think about your answers

27
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:36,580
而我就在这儿埋头苦干
while I'm here slaving away.

28
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,120
在《银翼杀手》里他没受到赏识
And he was underappreciated in "Blade Runner."

29
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,330
哈里森・福特逊毙了
Harrison Ford sucks.

30
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,210
你是说没受到赏识吗
"Underappreciated," you say?

31
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,570
那确实逊毙了
That does suck.

32
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,350
我们谁都不该这么说
Which none of us should be saying.

33
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,790
这是个很不好的词
That's a terrible word.

34
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,780
但是我们没有上楼去换衣服...
But instead of going upstairs to change...

35
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,090
而是去楼下...
We went downstairs...

36
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,310
玩有史以来最棒的游戏
To play the greatest sport of all time.

37
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,270
像所有无聊的同胞一样 
Like all bored siblings, my brother and I

38
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,770
哥哥和我发明了无数不同的游戏...
invented a ton of different games...

39
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,070
战役球
Battle-ball!

40
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,240
但这个是我们的最爱 叫做...
But this was our favorite. It was called...

41
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,460
球球 进了
Ball-ball! Yes!

42
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,610
那个是突围 所以是六分
That was on a breakaway, so it's 6 points

43
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,250
额外再加一轮
plus a bonus round!

44
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,350
与所有我和哥哥玩的游戏一样
Like every game I played with my big brother,

45
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,150
我一次也没赢过
I had never once won.

46
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,650
太悲哀了 甚至球球的纪念品
It was so bad, the ball-ball trophy

47
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,300
都是以他命名的
was even named after him.

48
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:16,990
这个让人觊觎的巴里杯
And the coveted Barry cup

49
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,250
又一次...
once again goes to...

50
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,620
投向巴里...
Barry...

51
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,150
诺曼...
Norman...

52
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,460
- 戈德堡的怀抱 - 嘿 嘿 别玩了  
- Goldberg! - Hey, hey! Knock it off.

53
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:28,130
别玩这个球球了
Enough with the ball-ball.

54
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,840
你们妈妈让你们去换衣服
Your mother told you to get dressed.

55
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,050
她也让你换
She told you, too.

56
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,570
我还差一步就好了 你还差四步
I'm one move away. You're four!

57
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,930
马上行动
Now move it!

58
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,080
我不会让你们毁了你们妈妈的感恩节的
I'm not gonna have you ruin your mother's thanksgiving.

59
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,150
但并不总是我们毁了老妈的感恩节
But it wasn't us that always ruined thanksgiving.

60
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,220
不 那个名号属于我的叔叔马文
No, that title went to my uncle Marvin.

61
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,770
可是 真的 为什么我们每年都得邀请他
But, seriously, why do we have to invite him every year?

62
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,600
因为马文是你的兄弟 是你唯一的家人
'Cause Marvin's your brother and the only family you've got?

63
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,530
不 我有你 我有她叫什么来着
No. I've got you, I got what's-her-name,

64
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,450
我有地下室里那两个笨蛋
I got the two morons in the basement.

65
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,110
我很好
I'm good.

66
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,040
看 每年你们都要打架
Look, every year you two fight,

67
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,870
甚至在我们坐下之前马文就离席而去
and Marvin ends up storming out before we even sit down.

68
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,380
就这一次 你就不能把所有消极的感觉
For once, can't you just take all the negative feelings

69
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,520
- 变成积极的吗 - 怎么变
- and spin them into a positive? - How?!

70
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:03,160
他甚至从没有过工作
He's never even had a job.

71
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,340
换成正面影响 他是个无拘无束的人
Positive spin-- he's a free spirit.

72
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:06,970
你不能给那个标价
You can't put a price on that.

73
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,440
从九百元开始怎么样
How's 900 bucks for starters?

74
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:12,550
那是我给他参加酒吧侍者学校付的学费
That's how much I paid for his bartending school,

75
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,440
然后他不及格被退学了 谁会干这种事
and he flunked out. Who does that?

76
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:15,590
我来告诉你谁会
I'll tell you who.

77
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,280
电影"花心情圣"中的汤姆克鲁斯
Tom Cruise in the movie "Cocktail,"

78
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:18,970
你知道最后他怎么样了么
and you know how that ended for him.

79
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,650
这个 其实 我没看过这部电影
Well, actually, I never saw that movie,

80
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,960
不过我猜他凭借他美妙的酒
but I assume he won over the whole city

81
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:26,680
赢得了全市的美誉
with his fancy drinks.

82
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:27,520
好
Fine!

83
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,510
当他到了这儿 我会试着对他好一点的
When he gets here, I will try and be nice to him.

84
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,280
你知道吗 亲爱的 带着新的积极的态度
You know what, hon? With a new positive attitude,

85
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,950
我想马文会让你大吃一惊的
I think Marvin's really gonna surprise you.

86
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,500
德劳瑞恩
Delorean!

87
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,450
的确大吃一惊 
Surprise.

88
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,730
最近咋样 默
What's up, Mur?

89
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:56,490
戈德堡一家 第一季09集

90
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,470
那是在一九八几年的感恩节
It was thanksgiving day, 1980-something,

91
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,800
我终于找到了
and I had finally discovered

92
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,650
可以和我叔叔聊天的话题
I had something to talk about with my uncle.

93
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,390
它有通量电容器吗
Does it have a flux capacitor?

94
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,240
它工作时是1.21千兆瓦吗
Does it run on 1.21 gigawatts?

95
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,650
你有被恐怖分子追捕过吗
Have you been chased by terrorists?

96
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,110
没 不过我有被女士们追捕过...
No, but I have been chased by the ladies...

97
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,260
因为那是个美臀磁铁
'Cause it's a ass magnet!

98
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,580
好了 问差不多了
Okay, enough questions.

99
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,480
恩 马文 要喝点什么吗
Um, Marv, can I get you something to drink?

100
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,760
额 不 你要喝点什么吗
Uh, no. Can I get you something to drink?

101
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,910
不是每天你的屋子里
It's not every day you got a semiprofessional bartender

102
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,120
都会有一个半职业的酒保 对吧
in your house, am I right?

103
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,190
嘿 鸡尾酒 嘿 呦 呦
Hey! Cocktail! Hey! Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

104
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,820
哈 马文 看起来不错
Ho! Marv-o! Lookin' good!

105
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,670
马上为您效劳 要哪种酒 艾尔
Right back at you. What's your poison, Al?

106
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,880
我要一杯金汤力
I'll take a gin and tonic.

107
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,430
太烈了 过
Too hard. Pass.

108
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,830
要葡萄酒或者蓝色夏威夷
Say wine or blue hawaiian.

109
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,480
我哪个都不想要
I really don't want either one of those.

110
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:43,130
好了  那就葡萄酒  下一个到谁
All right, wine it is. Who's next?

111
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,390
默哥 你要什么
Mur, what can I do you for?

112
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,150
我想知道车道上那东西 你是怎么买来的
I'd like to know how you paid for that thing in the driveway.

113
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,190
- 默里 - 怎么啦 我很积极啊
- Murray. - What?! I'm being positive.

114
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,670
我只是想了解下我弟弟的情况
I just want to know about my brother.

115
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,520
没关系
Uh, uh, no, no, no.

116
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,580
这问题问得很好
No, no, it's a perfectly fair question,

117
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,320
尤其是考虑到我们的过去
given our history.

118
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,480
说出来你们肯定不信
You guys aren't gonna believe me,

119
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:00,110
但是我真的找到了工作
but I actually got a job.

120
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,830
是吗 就像你在瑞典一样卖分时计算器吗
Yeah, like those time-shares in Sweden that you were selling.

121
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,580
或者就像我投资的驼羊牧场 我干的怎么样
Or like that alpaca farm I invested in. How did I do?

122
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:09,600
不怎样 它们生病了 弄伤了一些孩子
Not good. They got sick, they hurt some kids.

123
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:10,560
挺悲伤的事
Sad stuff.

124
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:13,800
不管怎样 我找到了一份普通的工作
Anyways, I got a regular old job.

125
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:16,340
穿套装 朝九晚五
I wear a suit. I work 9:00 to 5:00,

126
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,840
就像我大哥一样
just like my big bro here.

127
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,160
说到这儿...
Speaking of which...

128
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,850
我想还钱给你 一点点
I want to pay you back. A little bit.

129
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,750
我以前欠你的一些
For some of the money that I owe you.

130
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,800
这差不多有两千美金
There's like $2,000 in here.

131
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,300
是的 这只是九牛一毛 但起码是个开始
Yeah, it's a drop in the bucket, uh, but it's a start.

132
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,840
过来 过来
Come here. Come here.

133
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,310
- 这是第一次... - 过来
- For the first time... - Come here.

134
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,870
我爸爸对马文
My dad felt something for Marvin

135
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,990
感到从未有过的骄傲
he'd never felt before... pride.

136
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:40,520
太好啦
It's happening!

137
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,390
我们大家都坐在这边 表达一下感谢吧
Oh. Hey, let's all sit at the table and give thanks.

138
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,910
趁现在有气氛 快点
Right now, before it gets too late.

139
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,720
为了带这个人兜风 我已经等了
I have been waiting all month to give this guy

140
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,190
一个月啦
a ride in my car.

141
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,620
- 默里 你觉得呢 - 去兜风
- Mur, what do you say? - Let's ride.

142
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,880
默里老兄
Mur-man!

143
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,800
# 乘车 #
Motorin'

144
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:11,160
# 为了寻找另一半 #
what's your price for flight

145
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:16,320
# 你飞行的代价是什么 #
in finding Mr. Right

146
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:23,200
# 你今晚就会没事的 #
you'll be all right tonight

147
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,050
我听不懂这歌
I do not understand that song.

148
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,870
瞧瞧我们
Look at us.

149
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,880
像以前一样绕着詹金顿巡游
Cruisin' around Jenkintown like back in the day.

150
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:30,930
瞧瞧我们
Look at us, huh?

151
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,990
这是对深海乳液的致谢
And it's all thanks to lotions of the oceans.

152
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,010
- 乳液啥 - 我的新工作
- Lotions of the what? - It's my new job.

153
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,450
我是销售乳液的
I'm a lotioneer.

154
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:38,420
我卖面霜
I sell these facial creams

155
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,530
身体乳 它们中加入了
and body butters, and they're infused

156
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,340
海盐
with this real sea salt.

157
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:45,210
美好的东西 默... 你取少量这种东西
Beautiful thing, Mur... you take a dab of this stuff,

158
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,940
敷在你的脸上
you put it on your face,

159
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,530
你的皮肤就变得又滑又嫩
and your skin becomes so smooth and soft.

160
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,240
不管是什么吧 对你好就行
Well, whatever it is, good for you.

161
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,170
对你也有好处
Well, could be good for you.

162
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,520
只是一点现金投资
Just a little cash investment,

163
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:58,050
你就在低价的时候开始了这赚钱的生意
you get in on the ground floor of this killer business.

164
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,590
- 什么 - 只是这一次
- What? - Just this time

165
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,280
我听起来好像会有什么变化
you made it sound like it was gonna be different.

166
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,130
是有变化
It is different.

167
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,320
马文 我很想支持你
Marvin, I so want to support you,

168
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,690
但是你让我很难做
but you make it so hard.

169
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,670
你不相信我 没事 你摸摸我的脸
You don't believe me. Fine. Touch my face.

170
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,320
什么
What?

171
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,360
先别这么快做决定
Stop being so judgy for five seconds,

172
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,570
你摸摸我的脸 你就知道
and touch my face, and then you will understand

173
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,960
我的皮肤有多么好
how smooth and delightful my skin is.

174
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:20,670
- 摸一下 - 我不想摸你的脸
- Touch it. - I don't want to touch your face.

175
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,100
- 摸一下 - 我都不摸我老婆的脸
- Touch my face! - I don't even touch my wife's face.

176
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,320
就摸一下
Touch my face!

177
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:27,060
这摸起来一点都不像一个男人的皮肤
It's like I'm all man, except for this one tiny spot.

178
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,300
我才不摸
I'm not touching your face.

179
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,780
就像摸到婴儿的耳垂一样
It's like a little baby's earlobe!

180
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,060
你疯啦
You're out of your mind.

181
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,410
- 算啦 停车 - 什么
- That's it! Pull over! - What?

182
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,730
从我的驾驶座上下来
Remove yourself from the cockpit of my car!

183
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,650
我的爸爸不是唯一一个跟他弟弟享受
My dad wasn't the only one spending quality time

184
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,760
美好时光的人
with his brother.

185
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,190
决胜球
Battle-ball!

186
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:43,760
进啦 进啦
Yes! Yes!

187
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:46,420
刚刚是左手得分 我赢了两分
That's a left-handed goal! 2 points for me,

188
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:48,200
巴里又赢啦
and Barry wins again!

189
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,460
等等 等等 等等 你没有说"球球"
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You didn't call "ball-ball."

190
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,950
- 我说啦 - 不 你没有说 我听着呢
- Yes, I did. - No, you didn't. I was sitting right here.

191
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,510
那就要减两分 再罚一球
That's minus 2 points, plus a penalty shot.

192
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,540
- 站好 - 无所谓 没什么大不了
- Line up. - Whatever. Like it matters.

193
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:00,290
我当时没有想到
I didn't realize it at that moment,

194
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,810
但是当巴里用抱枕护住了他的腹部
but as Barry covered his groin with a throw pillow,

195
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,070
我们的整个局势就戏剧性的逆转了
our entire power dynamic was about to shift.

196
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,940
爆头 五分
Head-shot! 5 points!

197
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,510
不对 没有打中我的头
Nuh-unh! Didn't hit my head.

198
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,720
打中了 我看到了
Uh... Yes, it did. I was just watching.

199
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:16,100
我赢了 我赢了
I just won. I just won!

200
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,380
我刚刚赢了"球球"
I just won at ball-ball!

201
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,470
太假了 你根本不可能赢
Not true! There's no way you just won!

202
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,650
我很确定他赢了
I'm pretty sure he just won.

203
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,700
这个笨笨的四眼仔根本
There isn't a world where this little,

204
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,110
不可能打败我
unathletic, lazy-eyed nerd would beat me.

205
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,110
好吧 这个笨笨的四眼仔
Well, this unathletic, lazy-eyed nerd

206
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,480
刚刚赢了"球球"的冠军
is now ball-ball champion!

207
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:31,740
我创造了历史
History had been made,

208
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:34,200
而且跟任何一个冠军一样...
and I did what any champion would...

209
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:35,940
得意洋洋
Gloat.

210
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,570
我就知道 你不怀好意
I knew it! I knew you had an angle!

211
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,250
- 什么 - 你引诱我进入你的破车
- What? - You trapped me in your stainless steel box

212
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,800
就为了找我要钱
just to ask me for money!

213
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,610
不是找你要钱 我只是给你提供一个
It's not asking for money! I'm only telling you about

214
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,250
此生仅有的投资机会
the investment opportunity of a lifetime,

215
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,010
只花两千块
and it's gonna cost you $2,000.

216
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,080
你刚还了我两千块
You just paid me back $2,000!

217
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:52,220
那你就有钱投资了
So you have it!

218
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,510
你一定要当个大笨蛋吗
You have to be the biggest moron of all time.

219
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,620
笨蛋能开那么酷的车吗
Would a moron drive an awesome car like that?!

220
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:01,060
- 你买保险了吗 - 怎么啦 不
- Do you have insurance? - Why?! No!

221
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,660
天哪
Oh, my god!

222
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:03,500
不
No!

223
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,060
不
No!

224
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:07,300
你没拉上手刹啊
You didn't put the parking brake on!

225
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:10,580
傻帽 不 求你了
Moron! No! Please!

226
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:19,420
傻帽 天哪
Moron! Oh, gosh!

227
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:22,520
好吧 只有一个刮痕
Okay. Uhh! It's just a dent!

228
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:23,570
只有一个刮痕
It's just a dent.

229
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,530
算你好运 这货是美国生产的
You're lucky this thing was built in America.

230
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,600
你把车门弄歪了
You bent the frame!

231
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:35,440
是的 车门变形了
Yep. He bent the frame.

232
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,920
但我觉得车子比以前更酷炫
I thought the car looked even more awesome like this.

233
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:39,980
嘿 伙计
Hey, pal.

234
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,820
但我叔叔可不这么觉得
But my uncle did not agree.

235
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,800
- 他把车门撞歪了 - 啥...真的吗
- He bent the frame! - What--really?

236
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:44,930
他把车门撞歪了
He bent the frame!

237
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:47,890
现在我爸跟马文叔叔总算能相处
Now that my dad and uncle Marv were getting along,

238
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,330
我妈终于要收获对她的感谢了
my mom was finally gonna get her thanks.

239
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,380
好的 他们回来了
Okay, they're back!

240
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,190
但或许只是她一厢情愿
Or so she thought.

241
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,080
各位...
Everyone...

242
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:57,860
让我们坐在桌旁 致感恩词吧
Let's all sit at the table and say our thanks...

243
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,440
想对谁说都可以
to whoever that may be.

244
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:02,040
贝弗 很抱歉
Bevy, I am so sorry.

245
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:04,520
我知道你希望今年不同于往年
I know you wanted this year to be different,

246
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:05,970
但事实是
but it turns out

247
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,810
什么都没变
some things never change!

248
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,560
我告诉你什么变了
I'll tell you what's changed.

249
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,010
我再也不会回到这儿了
I'm never coming back here again.

250
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,580
你每年都这么说 但你还不是每年都来
You say that every year, but you keep showing up!

251
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,290
是 没错 但我这次是认真的
Yeah, well, this time I mean it!

252
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,260
我要打电话给德劳瑞恩的
I'm gonna call Delorean's

253
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,700
二十四小时维修热线
24-hour concierge maintenance line,

254
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,070
让他们过来修我的车
come fix my car...

255
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,050
然后我就走
And then I am so out of here!

256
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,070
不 谁都不准走
No! No one's going anywhere!

257
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,430
火鸡都烤好了
The turkey's out of the oven.

258
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,500
以前都没等到这个时候
We've never made it this far!

259
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:34,170
您拨打的电话无法接通
The number you have called has been disconnected.

260
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,480
出什么幺蛾子
What the hell?

261
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:37,130
他们不是倒闭了吗
Aren't they out of business?

262
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,660
你说啥
What are you talking about?

263
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,250
新闻上到处都是啊
It was all over the news.

264
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,800
那个经理 约翰・德劳瑞恩 他被捕了
The owner--John Delorean-- he was arrested

265
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:45,070
因为他想卖可卡因
for trying to sell two F.B.I. Agents

266
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,850
给两个联邦调查局的特工
cocaine powder.

267
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,290
你说啥
What are you saying to me?

268
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:51,620
说真的 这屋子里的负能量真是满的要爆炸了
Seriously, the negativity in this house is unbelievable!

269
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,820
哟 干嘛呢
Yo! Ad-rock! What's up?

270
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:59,150
听着 我想了很久
Listen, I've given it a lot of thought,

271
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,860
我决定发表官方声明 我承认
and I've decided to officially acknowledge

272
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,520
- 巴里杯是你赢的 - 应该叫亚当杯了
- that you won the Barry cup. - The Adam cup.

273
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,960
可以啊 重点是 我是个真男人
Sure. Point is, is I'm being a man

274
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,230
大度地承认你赢了
and agreeing that you won.

275
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,550
现在轮到你做真男人 跟我玩球
Now you be a man and play me in ball-ball

276
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,820
那样我才能赢回奖杯
so I can win the trophy back.

277
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,930
嗯 但我得告诉你一件事...
Yeah, here's the thing about that...

278
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,770
- 我不玩了 - 啥
- I retired. - What?

279
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,700
关于"球球"游戏
I've basically done all I needed to do

280
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,890
我差不多把能玩的招式都玩够了
on the ball-ball court,

281
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,710
现在我打算玩点别的
and now I'm looking to the future.

282
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,990
你不能赢了奖杯就不玩了 那你就永远是冠军了
You can't retire as champion. It makes you champion forever.

283
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,790
哦 我想是这样
Ooh, I guess it does.

284
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,030
好吧 我会在别的游戏上打败你的
Fine. I'll beat you at something else.

285
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,130
曲棍球 篮球 飞镖
Hockey, basketball, darts,

286
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,550
优诺牌 超级侦探
uno, clue,

287
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,550
{\an8}超级侦探 源于英国的纸上推理游戏

288
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:31,720
战舰 掰手腕
battleship, arm wrestling,

289
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:31,720
{\an8}战舰 一种纸上海战游戏

290
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,460
掰拇指 甚至真格的摔跤...
thumb wrestling, real wrestling...

291
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,430
随便跟我玩个游戏 我好打败你
Just play me in something so I can beat you in it!

292
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,410
你确定你能赢我
Are you sure you can beat me?

293
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,520
也许战斗力转移到我这里
Or has the power dynamic shifted,

294
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,910
你再也赢不了任何游戏了呢
and you'll never win anything ever again?

295
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,270
你是认真的吗
Are you serious right now?

296
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,180
从现在开始 你不再是大哥了
From now on, you're not the big brother anymore.

297
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,760
我才是
I am.

298
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:50,230
我永远都是大哥
I will always be the big brother.

299
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,930
我今年长了两英寸的个子
I've grown 2 inches this year.

300
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,570
你呢
How much have you grown?

301
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,900
我不会回答这种蠢问题
I don't have to answer that.

302
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:57,500
管好自己的事吧 因为从现在起
Get your affairs in order, 'cause from now on,

303
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,160
我是男子汉了
I'm the man.

304
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:01,360
现在...离我远一点
Now... Leave me to my robot.

305
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,700
当巴里的怒火逐渐升温时
While Barry's anger was heating up,

306
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,840
我妈精心准备的感恩节大餐要冷掉了
my mom's perfect thanksgiving was cooling down.

307
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:08,040
天哪...
Dude...

308
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,060
我快撑死了
I'm so stuffed!

309
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,520
等等 你从哪儿回来
Wait a minute. Where are you coming from?

310
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,590
我刚刚去了蕾妮家
I just ran over to Lainey's house.

311
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,710
她妈妈做的饭简直好吃到升天
Her mom made the most amazing feast.

312
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,960
我得躺下来
I need to lie down.

313
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,540
你最好留点肚子
Well, you better make room in your body,

314
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,810
因为这是感恩节
because this thanksgiving is happening.

315
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,350
我得向你坦白 贝弗
I gotta be honest with you, Bev.

316
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,540
我今天屡受打击
I'm taking a lot of body blows today.

317
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:34,950
真他妈太受打击了
Whole lot of body blows.

318
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,480
很显然 不仅是德劳瑞恩门店
Apparently, in addition to Delorean

319
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,940
没了全天修车服务
discontinuing their 24-hour concierge service,

320
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:43,180
我现在哪儿都买不到车子配件
now it's impossible for me to buy spare parts,

321
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:45,640
因为那家汽车公司倒闭了
because the company no longer exists!

322
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:48,490
真希望我买车之前有人能告诉我这件事
Really wish someone would have told me that before I bought the car.

323
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,000
我现在得叫出租车了
Point is, I'm calling a cab.

324
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:52,600
不 别叫出租车
No! No cabs!

325
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:55,010
我刚刚切好了火鸡 马文
I just cut the turkey, Marvin.

326
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,120
别这样
Come on.

327
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:58,170
我妈知道她伟大的感恩节感恩计划
My mom knew her big thanksgiving thank-you...

328
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,090
即将化为泡影
was going down the drain,

329
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:02,180
所以她准备动用每一份力量
so she decided to use every ounce of manipulation

330
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:04,370
甚至情感勒索
and emotional blackmail in her arsenal

331
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,350
来确保这事不会发生
to make sure that didn't happen.

332
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,730
她可以唱红脸...
She was good cop...

333
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,770
我知道你有个很邋遢的爹
I know you had a lousy father

334
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,780
你跟马文度过的童年很艰难
and your childhood with Marvin was very complicated.

335
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:15,350
我都了解 我永远站在你这边
I get it. I am on your side.

336
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,780
她也可以唱白脸...
She was bad cop...

337
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,440
我很生气 马文
I'm getting angry, Marvin.

338
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:21,060
你不会想看到我生气的
You won't like me when I'm angry.

339
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,010
她还可以装内疚...
She was guilt cop...

340
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,110
我差一点点就想放弃做一个妻子
I am this close to giving up as a wife,

341
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,760
一个母亲 甚至一个人类了
as a mother, and as a human being.

342
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28,780
最后 她甚至于干脆就撒谎了
And finally, she was the crooked cop that just plain lied.

343
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,410
你知道默里有多高傲
You know how prideful Murray is.

344
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,160
他刚明白告诉我
He literally just told me

345
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,840
他想投资你的公司
he wants to invest in your company,

346
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:36,880
只是他不知道该怎么说出口
but he doesn't know how to say it.

347
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,820
马文想向前看
Marvin wants to just move on

348
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:41,390
忘掉他跟你提过的这笔生意
and forget he ever mentioned the business to you.

349
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,270
没理由再提起了
There's no reason to ever bring it up again.

350
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,760
这是默里给你的支票 他希望你能收下
This is the check from Murray. He wants you to have it.

351
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:46,880
但是
But...

352
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:49,440
他也希望你不要在提这件事
He also wants you to never mention it.

353
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:51,870
永远不要提
Ever.

354
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:57,190
老妈成功施法 有那么几分钟
My mom had worked her magic, and for a few minutes,

355
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,690
还真像置身于一个正常的感恩节
it was actually like being at a normal thanksgiving.

356
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,660
于是我们就去了 
So there we were, okay?

357
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:02,910
康尼・马克体育场
Connie Mack stadium.

358
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,700
山迪・柯法斯刚和我们的
Sandy Koufax just pitched

359
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,450
费城人队来了场无安打赛局
a no-hitter against our Phillies.

360
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,490
他真是太出色了
He was unbelievable.

361
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,520
我们从看台最后的座位冲了下去
We run down from the nose-bleed seats.

362
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:11,080
真是倾其所有买来的票
That's all we could afford.

363
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:13,250
你们这些孩子根本不知道自己有多幸福
You kids have no idea how good you got it.

364
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,650
山迪正要走向球员休息区
Sandy is about to go into the dugout.

365
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,960
突然 他回转身来
Suddenly, he turns around,

366
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:18,960
看着我们 把球扔给了我
he looks at us, throws me the ball.

367
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:22,140
不对 是他把球扔给我的 因为我接住了
No. He threw me the ball, because I caught it.

368
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,620
他显然是扔给我的
He clearly threw it to me,

369
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,780
所以老爸才强迫你把球给了我
which is why dad made you give me the ball.

370
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:29,680
是啊 有史以来最棒的投球手
Yeah, the greatest pitcher of all time

371
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:30,570
站在八英尺开外
from 8 feet away

372
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:32,160
不知道球是扔给谁的吗
doesn't know what kid he's throwing to?

373
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:34,230
好了 保持积极心态
Okay. Keeping it positive.

374
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,310
晚餐进行到现在 
Uh, now's the time in our dinner

375
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,360
该我们围着餐桌走动
where we're all going to go around the table

376
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:41,990
说出我们最感谢的是什么事 什么人了
and say what or who we're most thankful for.

377
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,730
明白没 我来带头
All right? I'm gonna start.

378
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:48,590
我很感激能够与我最迷人可爱的家人在一起
I'm thankful to be surrounded by my beautiful, loving family.

379
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:50,530
埃里卡
Erica?

380
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,930
我都没法说话 我太撑了
I can't even talk, I'm so full.

381
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,020
好吧 巴里 接下去
Fine. Barry, go.

382
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:55,670
我要感谢"鳄鱼吃豆子"这款游戏
I'm thankful for the game hungry hungry hippos,

383
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,850
游戏已经在房间摆好了 有人要玩的话随时都可以
which is set up in the den if anyone wants to play.

384
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,990
我也要感谢我的家人
I am also thankful for my family,

385
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,630
我现在要从高到低给咱家列个权势表
which I'll now list from most to least powerful.

386
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,180
老爸 波普斯 老妈 埃里卡
Dad, pops, mom, Erica,

387
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:07,810
我 马文叔叔
me, uncle Marv,

388
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,160
当然 垫底的是巴里
and of course, dead last, Barry.

389
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:12,310
你为什么把我放在最后 你不可以这么做
Why are you putting me last? You can't put me last.

390
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,570
- 不可以吗 - 够了 能不能别吵了
- Can't I? - Okay, can we stop arguing

391
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,010
开始感谢真正有意义的人
and start thanking someone meaningful?

392
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,460
为你们含辛茹苦的人
Someone who's done a lot for you?

393
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:23,430
我要感谢一个一直在我身边陪伴我的小女人
I'm thankful for a little woman who's always been there for me,

394
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,310
不只是今天 多年来一直如此
not just today, but throughout the years.

395
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,720
幸运女神
Lady Luck.

396
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,400
要不是她 达拉斯牛仔队永远不会这么出色
Without her, the cowboys would never have covered the spread.

397
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:33,560
你们想知道我要感谢谁吗
You guys really want to know what I'm thankful for?

398
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:35,980
当然 说吧 别憋着
Of course. Come on, don't hold back.

399
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:38,520
有人特意嘱咐我不要再提此事
Well, I was told specifically not to mention it--

400
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,570
哦 天啊 那就别提了吧
Oh. Oh, boy. Uh, maybe don't.

401
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,080
- 不 我要说 - 算了吧
- Nah, I'm gonna do it. - Or not.

402
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:45,070
我要感谢我大哥
I am thankful for my big brother,

403
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,760
他是那么相信我
who believed in me enough

404
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:48,890
投资我的化妆品公司
to invest in my cosmetics venture.

405
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:49,540
我干啥
I what now?

406
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,240
马文 我们不是说好了不提这个了吗
Marvin, I thought we weren't gonna talk about that.

407
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:52,850
打住
Stop right there.

408
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,010
我们是要投资什么吗 算我一个
We're investing money in stuff? I'm in.

409
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:57,670
我爱死你们了
I love you guys.

410
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,840
你们一定会喜欢上深海乳液的
And--and you're gonna love lotions of the oceans.

411
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:02,730
真正的海盐哦
Real sea salt. Huh?

412
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:04,700
第二种原料是海藻
Kelp--second ingredient.

413
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,410
我这就去后备车厢拿样品
I'm gonna go get my samples out of the trunk.

414
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,440
你们会喜欢的
You're gonna love it.

415
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,380
所以
So...

416
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,800
还有人想表达一下感恩之情吗
anyone else like to give thanks?

417
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,730
好了 这就是我们的"毁春剂"
Okay, this is our brand-new face revujenator.

418
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,350
我想应该是"回春剂"吧
I think it's rejuvenator.

419
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:26,150
我想我知道什么是"毁春剂"的
I think I know what revujenator is.

420
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,430
我就是卖这玩意儿的
I'm the guy selling the stuff.

421
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,480
我已经感觉年轻多了 我们要发了
I feel younger already. We're gonna be rich.

422
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,120
奖杯在我这儿 我才是冠军
I have the cup! I'm the champion!

423
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:34,090
不是这么玩儿的 给我
That's not how it works! Give it back!

424
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,240
你在想什么呢
What were you thinking

425
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:37,540
- 背着我给马文钱 - 对不起
- giving Marvin money behind my back?! - I'm sorry.

426
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:39,490
是我搞砸了 但那一瞬间
I screwed up. But for a split second,

427
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,180
我看到你们俩和谐相处 我知道你很开心
I saw you two getting along, and I know you were happy.

428
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,610
好吧 我的确很开心
Fine, I was happy!

429
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,900
但那是因为我以为他长大了
But that's because I thought he'd grown up

430
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:46,520
不再需要我操心了
and I wouldn't have to take care of him anymore!

431
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,240
好了 听好了
Okay! Here you go.

432
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:50,470
你可能得从车库里腾出一些空间
You probably want to clear some space out of your garage,

433
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,840
因为你周一会收到
because you're gonna get a delivery

434
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:54,530
大概二十箱这玩意儿
of about, uh, 20 cases of this stuff on Monday.

435
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,350
我干嘛要二十箱这种废物
Why would I want 20 cases of that crap?

436
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,490
因为你投资了呀 对吧
Because you invested. Right?

437
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,580
我们...我们说好了的
That's--that-- that's the deal.

438
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,360
你...你兜售面霜 然后征召更多的人
You--you peddle the creams, and you recruit more people

439
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:02,920
来扩大你的销售三角
to expand your sales triangle.

440
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,680
销售三角
Sales triangle?

441
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,060
等等 这不是该死的非法传销吗
Wait. Is this a damn pyramid scheme?

442
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:10,250
不 不 我们有二十六层销售网好吗
No, no! Th-there's 26 tiers of sales, okay?

443
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,020
最上层的那些家伙挣的钱最多
The guys at the top, they make the most money,

444
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,710
然后像漏斗一样到底层的
and then it funnels down toward the base

445
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,250
三维三角区
of the three-dimensional triangle.

446
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,310
你描述的就是金字塔传销结构啊 笨蛋
You literally just described a pyramid, you idiot!

447
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,350
我算是知道怎么回事了
I see what it is.

448
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,320
我终于靠自己过上好日子了
I'm finally doing well for myself,

449
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:24,200
当然了 我哥哥 却觉得这是某种骗局
so my brother, of course, thinks it's some kind of a scam!

450
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,580
默里 快别说了 今天是感恩节
Murray, stop it! It's thanksgiving!

451
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,790
那就是传销啊
It's a pyramid!

452
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,160
- 我的脸好疼 - 有灼痛的感觉
- My face hurts. - It's burning real bad.

453
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:31,410
有灼痛感说明见效了
The burning means that it's working.

454
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,370
效果太强烈了 脸上火烧一般
It's working too much! There's fire on my face!

455
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,310
好了 赶紧擦掉
Okay... Just wipe it off.

456
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,150
- 今天是感恩节呢 - 快回来 那是我的奖杯
- It's thanksgiving. - Come back here! That's my cup!

457
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,960
回来 给我回来
Come back here! Come back here!

458
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:42,560
我现在疼死了
I'm in a great deal of pain now.

459
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,060
- 你知道吗  - 赶快擦掉
- You know what? - Get it off!

460
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,190
我才不管你们这些人怎么想的
I don't care what you people think.

461
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,560
我绝对支持我的产品
I stand by my product.

462
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,430
这么说 你何不也往脸上涂一些呢
Then, uh, why don't you put it on your face?

463
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,330
你要干嘛
What are you doing?

464
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:52,040
你之前在车上强烈要求我摸你的脸来着
You wanted me to touch your face so bad in the car.

465
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,210
- 快从我脸上弄掉 - 你误会我了
- Get away from my face. - You're taking it out of context.

466
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,820
- 来嘛  - 情况不一样
- Come on! - That was a different situation!

467
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:55,690
我的天啊
Oh, my god!

468
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,220
把你的手从他脸上拿开
Get your hand off his face!

469
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:59,320
今天是...感恩节啊
It's Thanks... Giving!

470
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:00,680
不 天啊
No! Oh, my god!

471
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:03,930
- 默里 - 天啊
- Murray! - Oh, my god!

472
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:06,120
爸爸和叔叔像孩子一样
It was a sad sight watching my dad and uncle

473
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,400
扭作一团真不忍直视
fight like children,

474
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:10,820
但更可悲的是 马文不得不求人送他回家
but even sadder was that Marvin had to ask for a ride home.

475
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,670
我周一会叫个拖车过去
I'm gonna send a flatbed over on Monday,

476
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,650
如果下雨了
so if it begins to rain,

477
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,350
麻烦用防水布把我的德劳瑞恩盖一下
please cover the Delorean with a tarp or something.

478
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:24,250
- 你的眼睛怎么样了 - 还有点刺痛
- How's your eye? - Still a little sting-y.

479
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:27,850
你说的没错
You're right about me.

480
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,730
我是个蠢蛋
I'm a moron.

481
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,260
我的车毁了 我还住在咱父母家
My car's a bust, I still live in our parents' house,

482
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,170
很显然 我竟然蠢得没意识到
and apparently I'm too stupid to realize

483
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,090
那个三角和金字塔形状一样
that a triangle is the same shape as a pyramid.

484
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,680
我也说不清 我只是希望有那么一次
I don't know, I just wish that once

485
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:42,090
我能做件像样的事 不让你失望 默里
I could do something that didn't disappoint you, Murray.

486
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,520
你干嘛在乎我怎么想
What do you care what I think?

487
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:46,100
开什么玩笑呢 是你把我拉扯大的
Are you serious? You raised me.

488
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,630
爸爸从来不在我身边 而你一直都在
I mean, dad wasn't there. You were.

489
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,790
- 你是我的榜样 - 千万别
- You're the one I look up to. - Well, don't.

490
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,490
我也只是情非得已
I was just doing what I had to do.

491
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,350
因为我 你放弃了你的童年生活
Yeah, well, you gave up your childhood for me.

492
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,990
别以为我不记得
Don't think I forgot that.

493
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,280
我很高兴那么做了
I was glad to do it.

494
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,000
不 才没有呢
No, you weren't.

495
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,360
你说得对
You're right.

496
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,370
我确实很想去参加我的毕业舞会
I would have liked to have gone to my prom.

497
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:05,160
是啊 我很抱歉当时喝了清洁剂
Yeah. I'm sorry I ate that detergent.

498
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,240
只是它真的很好闻
It just smelled really good.

499
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:10,830
重点是 照顾你确实不太容易
Look, the poinis, it wasn't easy looking after you.

500
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,130
但我并不后悔
But I don't regret it.

501
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,300
我叫你蠢蛋的唯一原因
And the only reason I call you a moron...

502
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:16,800
是因为我希望你能得到最好的
Is because I want the best for you.

503
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:18,500
- 真的吗 - 当然了
- Really? - Yeah.

504
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,200
等我一下好吗
Hold on a second, all right?

505
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,290
哪儿都别去 我去去就回
Don't go anywhere. I'll... I'll be right back.

506
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:26,920
事实证明 并不是那辆德劳瑞恩车
Turns out it wasn't the Delorean

507
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:29,640
迫使我老爸和他弟弟回到过去
that forced my dad and his brother to revisit the past.

508
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:32,030
而是我爸的破烂旅行车
It was my dad's crappy old station wagon.

509
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,340
我希望你收下这个
I want you to have that.

510
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:40,680
- 柯法斯的棒球  -是的
- The Koufax ball? - Yeah.

511
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:41,720
我不能收
I can't!

512
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:44,370
收下吧  算是对你童年的一丢丢弥补
Take it. Have a little bit of your childhood back.

513
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,490
我们都知道他确实是扔向你的
We both know that he was throwing it to you.

514
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,010
进来吧
Get your butt in here.

515
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,830
抓紧时间 感恩节还没过完呢
Come on. Thanksgiving's not over.

516
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,850
- 我们能谈谈吗 - 不行
- Can we talk? - No.

517
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:02,860
听着
listen.

518
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:06,740
看到老爸和马文叔叔的二货表现
After I saw dad and uncle Marv acting like morons,

519
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:09,320
我觉得 也许我会和你再来一场比赛
I thought, maybe I will give you that rematch.

520
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:10,340
我还以为你不想呢
Thought you didn't want to

521
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:11,710
你现在可是大哥呢
'Cause you're the big brother now.

522
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,140
别这样嘛
Oh, come on.

523
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:15,060
你永远都是我的大哥
You'll always be my big brother.

524
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:23,530
有史以来第一次 我妈妈得到了她梦寐以求的
For the first time ever, my mom ended up getting

525
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,950
完美感恩节
her perfect thanksgiving.

526
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,630
我们甚至坚持到了甜点环节
We even made it to dessert.

527
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:30,090
嘿 我可以说几句话吗
Hey. Can I just, uh, say something here?

528
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:33,610
我觉得我们都该好好感谢你们的妈妈
I think we should give mom a big thanks

529
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,890
花了这么多心思
for working her ass off

530
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,200
让我们大家团聚在一起
and bringing us all together.

531
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,180
来干一杯
Hear, hear.

532
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,680
是啊 贝弗 来喝一杯
Yeah, Bev. Hear, hear.

533
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,550
我所做的一切并非要让你们感恩
That's--that's not why I do it,

534
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,840
但非常感谢你们
but thank you very much.

535
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:46,800
能得到大家的赏识好开心
It's nice to be appreciated.

536
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,110
对我和巴里来说
As for me and Barry,

537
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,770
一个新的球球时代开始了
a new era of ball-ball had begun,

538
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,140
胜负难测
and it was anybody's game.

539
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,590
他进球了 得分了
He shoots! He scores!

540
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,890
他赢了
He wins!

541
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,460
哈 你没说"球球"
Ah! You didn't say "ball-ball."

542
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,580
真该死
