Well, the machine's saying that you're 12 weeks and one day,

10
00:00:53,017 --> 00:00:56,097

11
00:00:57,577 --> 00:01:00,737
它已经长出了头  手臂还有双腿
There's a head, arms, legs.

00:01:02,917 --> 00:01:05,017
没错  是它的心脏在跳
Yeah, that's the heart beating.

什么  老兄  你不能那么问
What, mate! You can't say that.

31
00:03:01,297 --> 00:03:03,777
你不能这样讨论我兄弟的女人
You can't talk about my mate's girlfriend like that.

32
00:03:03,777 --> 00:03:04,717
你这个混蛋真幸运
You are one lucky bastard.

33
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:06,717
这不是幸不幸运的问题  卡尔  老兄
Luck had nothing to do with it, Carl, man.

34

I knew for a fact...she's fucking gagging for it, what do you reckon?

39
00:03:24,657 --> 00:03:26,617
你收到我短信了吗
Did you get my text?

40
00:03:26,617 --> 00:03:28,817
他收到她的短信了诶
He got her text.

41
00:03:28,817 --> 00:03:29,937
你还好吗

46
00:03:44,497 --> 00:03:47,977
- 怎么啦  怎么啦  - 唔~老兄  你把她惹毛了
- What happened there?- Ooh,mate,you pissed her off.

47
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:49,937
罗柏  你去哪儿
Rob, where are you going?

48
00:03:49,937 --> 00:03:52,497
- 简直不敢相信  - 琳  等等
- I don't believe that. - Linds, man.

49
00:03:54,097 --> 00:03:55,297
- 琳  - 别碰我
- Linds. - Get off me!

50
00:03:57,597 --> 00:03:58,497
琳
Linds.

51
00:04:05,297 --> 00:04:09,017
你他娘的不准再跟那帮狐朋狗友在背后嘲笑我
Don't you ever fucking laugh at me again like that with your mates.

52
00:04:09,017 --> 00:04:11,017
听见了吗
Do you understand?

53
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:26,257
- 你是在躲我吗  - 不是
- Are you avoiding me? - No.

54
00:04:26,257 --> 00:04:28,657
那你为什么不回我短信
Why didn't you answer my text?

55
00:04:30,577 --> 00:04:32,977
因为我一直很忙
Because I've been busy.

56
00:04:32,977 --> 00:04:34,937
放屁
You liar.

57
00:04:34,937 --> 00:04:38,017
这件事很严肃  罗柏
This is serious, Robert.

58
00:04:38,017 --> 00:04:40,457
这件事跟我们
This. Us.

59
00:04:40,457 --> 00:04:42,097
跟我
Me.

60
00:04:42,097 --> 00:04:44,657
- 我可是怀孕了  - 我知道
- I'm pregnant. - I know.

61
00:04:46,977 --> 00:04:48,697
这不是在过家家
It's not a fucking joke.

62
00:04:48,697 --> 00:04:53,017
这也不是你跟你那帮蠢货兄弟茶余饭后的笑话
It's not something you can laugh about with your idiot mates.

63
00:04:53,017 --> 00:04:55,097
这是...真的
It's...it's real.

64
00:04:55,097 --> 00:05:00,137
这是真的  这是你的种  你得负你该负的责任
It's happening. It's yours. You need to get your head around it.

65
00:05:00,137 --> 00:05:04,657
你不能再像个瘪三一样  也不能再继续躲着我
You need to stop acting like a complete twat and stop avoiding me.

66
00:05:04,657 --> 00:05:07,097
你得负责任
You need to take responsibility.

67
00:05:08,097 --> 00:05:10,017
- 我是在负啊  - 你没有
- I am. - You're not.

68
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:13,457
我会负责任的
I will.

69
00:05:16,737 --> 00:05:20,377
我没有...我没有跟你要钱
I'm not...I'm not asking you to give me money.

70
00:05:20,377 --> 00:05:26,337
我也没让你给宝宝买衣服什么的
I'm not asking for you to buy me baby clothes or anything,

71
00:05:26,337 --> 00:05:30,377
但是你得鼓足勇气看着我的眼睛
but you need to find the courage to look me in the eyes

72
00:05:30,377 --> 00:05:34,417
告诉我你的想法  你的感受  还有...
and tell me what you're thinking, what you're feeling and what...

73
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,537
你在做什么  你要做什么
what you're doing and what you want to do.

74
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:38,637
- 你明白吗  罗柏  - 明白
- You understand me, Robert? - Yeah.

75
00:05:38,637 --> 00:05:40,737
- 你真明白吗  - 当然
- Do you understand? - Yeah.

76
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:53,897
你娘的最好明白了
You fucking better had.

77
00:06:56,337 --> 00:06:58,897
这些门质量真好  对吧
They're quality, these doors, eh?

78
00:06:58,897 --> 00:07:01,537
700磅一块呢
700 quid a pop.

79
00:07:03,057 --> 00:07:06,097
艾利克斯肯定会爱死这个的
Alex is going to love these.

80
00:07:06,097 --> 00:07:08,037
- 罗柏  - 啊
- Robert. - Yeah?

81
00:07:08,037 --> 00:07:11,337
我说“艾利克斯肯定会爱死这个的”
I said Alex is going to love these.

82
00:07:11,337 --> 00:07:14,137
对对对  肯定的
Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely.

83
00:07:14,137 --> 00:07:17,057
你今天到底怎么回事
What's the matter with you today?

84
00:07:17,057 --> 00:07:19,097
你的魂儿丢了吗
You away with the fairies?

85
00:07:19,097 --> 00:07:20,617
抱歉  老爸
Sorry, mate.

86
00:07:22,417 --> 00:07:26,937
它们有磁性吗   到底是怎么搞来着
Are they magnetic?Yeah,what's the matter with that?

87
00:07:26,937 --> 00:07:31,737
嗯  对了 下楼去把水烧上  还有硅滑脂拿上来一下
Hmmm.Right,go downstairs,put the kettle
on, and bring me up the silicone grease.

88
00:07:35,937 --> 00:07:38,857
这真是做得不错
This is a job well done.

89
00:07:38,857 --> 00:07:40,377
嗯嗯
Hmm.

90
00:07:45,777 --> 00:07:48,737
- 我等不下去了  - 会很好的
- I can't wait to see Alex. - It's going to be great.

91
00:07:48,737 --> 00:07:52,057
我都不敢相信他会完好无损的回来
I can't believe he's coming back for good.

92
00:07:56,777 --> 00:08:00,137
嗯  我跟他我们俩完全不同  对吧
Yeah, we're quite different, me and him, aren't we?

93
00:08:00,137 --> 00:08:03,297
- 什么意思  - 他比我勇敢多了
- How do you mean? - He's a lot braver than I am.

94
00:08:03,297 --> 00:08:05,297
- 更勇敢  - 对  他年轻有为
- Braver? - Yeah, he does stuff.

95
00:08:05,297 --> 00:08:07,017
- 你也有所作为啊  - 就装个管道吗
- You do stuff. - Plumbing.

96
00:08:07,017 --> 00:08:09,297
装管道怎么又突然惹着你了
Well, what's wrong with plumbing all of a sudden?

97
00:08:09,297 --> 00:08:12,297
装管道没什么丢人的  家家都需要装管道  罗柏
Nothing wrong with plumbing. Everyone needs plumbing, Robert.

98
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:18,617
你肯定很以他为傲
You must be properly proud of him, though.

99
00:08:18,617 --> 00:08:19,617
我为你们俩都感到很骄傲
I'm proud of you and all.

100
00:08:19,617 --> 00:08:22,657
对  但更以他为骄傲
Yeah, but in comparison,

101
00:08:22,657 --> 00:08:24,657
- 比如说...  - 罗柏
- like when... - Robert.

102
00:08:24,657 --> 00:08:27,017
我只是实事求是而已  老爸
Stands to reason, Dad.

103
00:08:33,617 --> 00:08:34,517
你觉得我更想你多一点吗
Do you think I'm more like you?

104
00:08:34,517 --> 00:08:36,817
罗柏  今天你到底吃错什么药了
Robert, what's got into you today?

105
00:08:36,817 --> 00:08:40,657
- 没有  我就是在想事而已  - 那就别想了
- Nothing. I was just thinking. - Well, stop thinking.

106
00:08:42,177 --> 00:08:44,737
想得太多会让你盲目的
Too much thinking makes you blind.

107
00:08:44,737 --> 00:08:47,417
我像你这么大时就不胡思乱想
When I was your age I wasn't thinking.

108
00:08:47,417 --> 00:08:50,257
我有次一下就捉到三只鸟
I was out there banging three birds at a time.

109
00:08:50,257 --> 00:08:50,777
嗯  好吧
Yeah, right.

110
00:08:50,777 --> 00:08:54,977
而且作为一个学徒  你还有很多事要做
Yeah, and doing an apprenticeship and all,
you've got a lot of catching up to do.

111
00:09:22,137 --> 00:09:23,177
琳
Linds,

112
00:09:23,177 --> 00:09:25,457
能借你点时间吗
can I borrow you a sec?

113
00:09:31,937 --> 00:09:34,017
呃...
Erm...

114
00:09:36,457 --> 00:09:38,897
我只是有点吓坏了而已
I'm just a bit scared, Lindsey.

115
00:09:40,977 --> 00:09:42,857
我知道
I know.

116
00:09:42,857 --> 00:09:44,777
好吧
OK.

117

118
00:09:57,497 --> 00:09:59,217
好吗
Yeah?

119
00:10:01,337 --> 00:10:03,537
但我还是得告诉你
I just had to tell you as well.

120
00:10:06,697 --> 00:10:09,097
我待会儿过去找你  好吗
I'll come find you, yeah?

121
00:10:10,377 --> 00:10:12,137
好吧
Cool.

122
00:10:21,497 --> 00:10:24,517
- 他说什么了  - 没什么
- What did he say? - Oh, nowt.

123
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:26,417
什么  他什么也没说吗
What, he didn't say anything?

124
00:10:28,057 --> 00:10:30,177
- 那他还好吗  - 嗯
- Well, was he all right then? - Mmm.

125
00:11:12,417 --> 00:11:16,617
爸  这是琳赛  琳赛  咱爸  互相认识一下吧

127
00:11:21,257 --> 00:11:23,557
我刚把水烧上  你要喝杯茶吗
I've put the kettle on, d'ya want a cup?

128
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:24,857
不用了  我不喝茶的
No, I don't drink tea.

129
00:11:26,577 --> 00:11:29,457
好吧  好吧
Right. Right.

130
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:32,037
在学校还好吧
How was school?

131
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:38,177
我以为你出去了呢  爸
I thought you were going out, Dad.

132
00:11:38,177 --> 00:11:40,017
不用了  艾利克斯打电话说火车八点半才到
Nah, Alex called, his train's coming in at 8.30.

133
00:11:40,417 --> 00:11:44,417
- 是吗  这样挺好  - 你从哪儿过来的
- Oh, really, cool. - Where you been?

134
00:11:44,417 --> 00:11:47,297
游泳池那边
Just come from the pool.

135
00:11:47,297 --> 00:11:51,097
- 你游泳吗  - 不是  我跳水
- What, you swim? - No, I do diving.

136
00:11:51,097 --> 00:11:53,177
跳水吗  很不错嘛
Diving? Very impressive.

137
00:11:53,177 --> 00:11:54,217
嗯
Hmm.

138
00:11:56,897 --> 00:12:00,937
我们去楼上没关系吧  爸
We're just going to go upstairs, Dad, that's all right, isn't it?

139
00:12:01,937 --> 00:12:05,577
- 很高兴认识你  - 我也是  琳赛
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, Lindsey.

140
00:12:14,057 --> 00:12:16,457
嘘嘘嘘
Sssshhh!

141
00:12:43,017 --> 00:12:45,097
天呐
Oh, my God!

142
00:12:50,257 --> 00:12:52,537
你觉得他听到了吗  琳
Do you reckon he heard, Linds?

143
00:12:52,537 --> 00:12:55,137
琳赛
Lindsey!

144
00:13:08,457 --> 00:13:10,977
“我不喝茶的”
"I don't drink tea."

145
00:13:21,457 --> 00:13:24,497
不喝茶又怎么了  爸
What's wrong with not drinking tea, Dad?

146
00:13:27,257 --> 00:13:29,257
没什么
Nothing.

147
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:32,817
火车来了
Here's the train.

148
00:13:52,617 --> 00:13:54,737
艾利克斯  艾利克斯
Alex! Alex, mate!

149
00:13:54,737 --> 00:13:56,977
我自己能走回去的  爸
I could have walked, Dad.

150
00:13:56,977 --> 00:13:58,697
别傻了  我们才不会让你走路呢
Don't be silly, we're not going to let you walk.

151
00:13:58,697 --> 00:13:59,897
我挺喜欢走路的
I like walking.

152
00:13:59,897 --> 00:14:01,657
- 你还好吗 儿子  - 还好啦
- You all right boy? - All right.

153
00:14:01,657 --> 00:14:03,217
好孩子
Good lad.

154
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,597
- 你还好吗  小柏  - 见到你真开心
- How you doing, Bob? - It's good to see you.

155
00:14:04,597 --> 00:14:05,597
我也很开心  小柏
Good to see you. Bob.

156
00:14:05,597 --> 00:14:06,697
- 你还好吗  - 嗯
- You all right? - Yeah.

157
00:14:06,697 --> 00:14:08,817
- 好兄弟  - 爸  不用你拿
- Good man. - Dad, leave them.

158
00:14:08,817 --> 00:14:09,617
- 没关系的  你歇着  - 把包放下  爸  我说真的
- No, you're all right. - Leave them, seriously.

159
00:14:09,617 --> 00:14:10,757
不  我拿就行了  罗柏  帮你哥拿包
No, I'll carry it. Robert, get his bag.

160
00:14:10,757 --> 00:14:13,657
- 放下  快放下  爸  - 不  你走你的就行了
-  Leave it. Leave it, Dad. - No, go on.

161
00:14:15,097 --> 00:14:17,737
我自己放的柱子  可结实了
I put the banister on meself, solid that.

162
00:14:17,737 --> 00:14:22,537
地毯都是新铺的  你的电热煮沸器  其它电器也都在
All new carpet laid. Your immersion heater, your electrics in there.

163
00:14:22,537 --> 00:14:24,657
还有专门给你打造的厨房
And there's your fitted kitchen.

164
00:14:35,497 --> 00:14:38,017
那你们在这上面花了多少时间
How long have you both been working on this, then?

165
00:14:38,017 --> 00:14:40,257
总共加起来就六七个月的样子  对吧 柏仔
About six or seven months all told, wasn't it, Bobby?

166
00:14:43,617 --> 00:14:45,657
你觉得怎么样
What do you think?

167
00:14:51,777 --> 00:14:54,617
我必须得说  我讨厌死这个鬼地方了
I have to say, I fucking hate the place.

168
00:14:56,137 --> 00:14:58,217
什么
What?

169
00:14:58,217 --> 00:15:01,737
又小又脏  又跟狗窝一样臭  还不值钱  你说呢
It's a poxy, little, rank, little shit hole, in't it?

170
00:15:01,737 --> 00:15:05,377
就像是用塑料堆出来的一样
It looks like it's made out of plastic.

171
00:15:07,417 --> 00:15:11,177
我都能想象得到你站在这里告诉所有人
I could just imagine you now. Telling everyone round here,

172
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:13,217
“我儿子要回来了”
"My son's coming back.

173
00:15:13,217 --> 00:15:15,617
“我给他买了套房子  你们知道吗
"I've got him his own flat, don't you know?

174
00:15:15,617 --> 00:15:20,017
“他去过阿富汗  他他娘的是个当兵的  你们知道吗”
"He's been to Afghanistan, don't you know?
He's a fucking soldier, don't you know?"

175
00:15:20,017 --> 00:15:21,897
我很为你骄傲  艾利克斯  我只是想给你这些而已
I'm proud of you, Alex. I just wanted to give you this.

176
00:15:21,897 --> 00:15:23,897
爸  你不知道我待过什么样的地方
Dad, you wouldn't believe the places I've been to.

177
00:15:25,697 --> 00:15:29,017
你也不知道我见过什么样的事
You wouldn't believe the things that I've seen.

178
00:15:29,017 --> 00:15:30,537
我知道  儿子
I know, boy.

179
00:15:30,537 --> 00:15:33,937
不  你不知道  爸  你屁都不知道
No, you don't know, Dad. You know fuck all.

180
00:15:35,657 --> 00:15:38,417
你还是留着自己养老吧
Shove this place up your arse.

181
00:15:47,057 --> 00:15:49,817
- 别放在心上  爸  - 别说了  出去
- I probably wouldn't listen,Dad. - No,get out.

182
00:16:08,657 --> 00:16:10,457
她是个跳水运动员
She's a diver.

183
00:16:10,457 --> 00:16:12,417
你已经说过了
You've told me that already.

184
00:16:12,417 --> 00:16:14,537
但是她就要去参加奥运会了
Nah, but she's going to be in the Olympics and that.

185
00:16:14,537 --> 00:16:16,577
她真的要去参加奥运会吗
Is she really? The Olympics.

186
00:16:28,377 --> 00:16:30,377
她怀孕了
She's pregnant.

187
00:16:32,497 --> 00:16:34,577
- 你要带她去流产吗  - 什么
- You going to get an abortion? - What?

188
00:16:36,097 --> 00:16:38,617
你要我借你点钱吗
Do you need me to give you some money?

189
00:16:38,617 --> 00:16:40,817
我可以借给你  我还是有点积蓄的
I can do, mate. I'm loaded.

190
00:16:44,977 --> 00:16:47,857
我们还没决定要怎么做
We haven't really made a decision on what we're going to do.

191
00:16:47,857 --> 00:16:50,577
你想让她流产的  老弟
You want to get an abortion, mate.

192
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:53,257
她最后还是会同意的  对吗
She's only going to fuck off in the end, in't she?

193
00:16:53,257 --> 00:16:55,457
孩子会毁了她的  小柏
Babies aren't all their cracked up to be, Bobby.

194
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:07,737
我见过的最后一个婴儿就在我面前
The last baby I saw had its arms and legs blown off right in front of me.

195
00:17:09,657 --> 00:17:11,617
被美国人的迫击炮炸得血肉模糊  肢体横飞
US mortar bomb misfired.

196
00:17:15,497 --> 00:17:18,257
只是婴儿而已  小柏
Just babies, Bobby.

197
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,657
你不会留下它的  对吧
You're not keeping it anyway, are you?

198
00:17:25,817 --> 00:17:28,897
我也不知道  我们都还没做好决定呢
Well, I don't know, that's what I mean, we haven't made a decision.

199
00:17:28,897 --> 00:17:32,777
你知道这会让爸多难堪吗  看看你所处的环境
What sort of a shithawk dad would you make? Look at the state of you.

200
00:17:32,777 --> 00:17:35,217
我们家不能再多添一个人了  小柏
We don't need any more people, Bobby.

201
00:17:35,217 --> 00:17:37,377
人都他娘的不是东西
People are fucking shit.

202
00:17:38,377 --> 00:17:40,617
而你又多搞出一个
You having another?

203
00:17:40,617 --> 00:17:42,617
继续说啊
Yeah, go on then.

204
00:18:24,657 --> 00:18:26,897
琳...
Linds...

205
00:18:29,097 --> 00:18:33,057
你有没有考虑过...

206
00:18:33,057 --> 00:18:34,817
那个...

207
00:18:34,817 --> 00:18:37,537
呃...
erm...

208
00:18:37,537 --> 00:18:40,497
你是想留下孩子还是...
like about whether you want to keep the baby or...

209
00:18:45,777 --> 00:18:48,097
我什么都还没想过
I've not thought about anything else.

210
00:19:26,177 --> 00:19:29,777
没关系的  你不需要害怕
It's all right, you don't have to be scared, you know.

211
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:33,357
我其实挺喜欢它的
I quite like it.

212
00:19:54,737 --> 00:19:58,217
- 我能告诉你件事儿吗  琳  - 说吧
- Can I tell you something, Linds? - What's that?

213
00:20:00,257 --> 00:20:02,137
我很喜欢这个镇子
I love this town.

214
00:20:02,137 --> 00:20:04,137
我很爱它
I love it.

215
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:09,457
我不知道还有什么地方我待得比这儿还习惯
I don't think there's anywhere else I'd rather
be right now at this second than here.

216
00:20:16,737 --> 00:20:22,337
我想这就是我 我想在这里有个好的生活才是我想要的
I reckon that's me, I reckon that's all I want
really, just to have a nice life in this town.

217
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:26,497
嗯
Yeah.

218
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:49,177
- 你知道吗  琳  - 什么
- D'ya know what, Linds? - What?

219
00:20:49,177 --> 00:20:51,977
我觉得我们应该争取一下孩子的事儿
I think we should just go for it, you know, this baby business.

220
00:20:53,737 --> 00:20:57,817
人人都觉得我们还年轻  很天真  去他大爷的
Everybody says we're too young or too naive, fuck 'em.

221
00:20:57,817 --> 00:21:00,057
我觉得我们俩在一起会过得很好的
I think we'd be great together me and you.

222
00:21:00,057 --> 00:21:01,937
我觉得我们会在一起过的非常好的
I think we'd be great together.

223
00:21:01,937 --> 00:21:04,617
- 我觉得我们会很优秀的  - 非常优秀
- I think we'd be sterling. - Sterling.

224
00:21:04,617 --> 00:21:06,337
- 嗯  - 对啊
- Hmmm. - Yeah.

225
00:21:07,937 --> 00:21:10,577
- 我确实很优秀   - 我也是
- I do. - Me too.

226
00:21:16,217 --> 00:21:19,857
- 我还想跟你说件事  - 是吗

227

228
00:21:26,537 --> 00:21:28,777
我也爱你
I love you too.

229
00:21:50,657 --> 00:21:54,337
我告诉了艾莉森我这周开始不去训练了
I told Alison I'd stop training at the end of the week.

230
00:21:54,337 --> 00:21:57,017
那这样感觉如何
How do you feel about that?

231
00:21:57,017 --> 00:21:59,537
我觉得这样做才是正确的选择
I think it was the right thing to do.

232
00:22:00,537 --> 00:22:03,497
对啊  鱼与熊掌不能兼得  对吧
Yeah, we can't have it all, can we?

233
00:22:17,577 --> 00:22:19,817
- 还好吗  儿子  - 还行
- All right, boy? - Yes.

234
00:22:40,857 --> 00:22:43,097
- 你今天如何  - 很忙
- How was your day? - Busy.

235
00:22:44,097 --> 00:22:46,737
我明天早上要早点出去
I'm out early in the morning.

236
00:22:46,737 --> 00:22:48,977
- 几点  - 五点半
- What time? - Half five.

237
00:22:53,017 --> 00:22:54,657
今天过得好吗
Good day?

238
00:22:54,657 --> 00:22:56,177
很好
Yeah, man.

239
00:23:26,257 --> 00:23:28,697
这是什么
What's this?

240
00:23:33,417 --> 00:23:36,337
罗柏  这是我想的那样吗
Robert, is this what I think it is?

241
00:23:39,977 --> 00:23:42,017
你做了什么
What have you done?

242
00:23:46,857 --> 00:23:49,137
在我为你做了那么多之后
After all I've done for you.

243
00:23:51,697 --> 00:23:54,017
我想这肯定是她的
I suppose it's hers.

244
00:23:54,017 --> 00:23:57,857
“我不喝茶小姐”  那个狗屁奥运会运动员的
Miss "I don't drink tea"Olympic fucking athlete.

245
00:23:57,857 --> 00:24:01,057
那个“完美个屁小姐”  她现在还没那个资格  你说呢
She not so high and mighty now, is
she, little Miss fucking perfect?

246
00:24:01,057 --> 00:24:02,057
别这样说  爸
Don't, Dad.

247
00:24:03,457 --> 00:24:08,057
罗柏  你到底知不知道你妈走了之后我工作有多难
Robert, have you any idea how hard I've
worked for you since your mother left?

248
00:24:08,057 --> 00:24:09,897
一个人操持着这个家
Kept all this together.

249
00:24:09,897 --> 00:24:12,937
而你就是这样来帮我的
And this is you just shitting on it.

250
00:24:12,937 --> 00:24:15,377
你就他妈的这么来帮我的
Just fucking shitting on it!

251
00:24:16,377 --> 00:24:20,857
你他娘的不要脸的蠢货  滚出老子的视线
You fucking stupid little idiot! Get out of my fucking sight!

252
00:24:20,857 --> 00:24:23,497
我简直不敢相信你会这样对我
I can't believe you've done this to me.

253
00:24:26,977 --> 00:24:29,577
你娘个十足的大蠢货
fucking stupidity!

254
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:03,177
这地方有点烂  对吧
It's a bit of shit hole, isn't it?

255
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:07,217
我其实还挺喜欢这儿的
I quite like it.

256
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:19,657
其实我也是
Me too actually.

257
00:26:43,177 --> 00:26:46,057
罗柏  你知道我们总会聊一聊的
Robert, you know that we'll be there.

258
00:26:46,057 --> 00:26:49,217
这对你跟对琳赛一样重要
I mean, as much for you as Lindsey, you know.

259
00:26:50,857 --> 00:26:53,297
这样会安心一点
That's reassuring to know, you know,

260
00:26:53,297 --> 00:26:57,617
因为我们有太多要面对的事了
cos, yeah, I know, there's a lot to face.

261
00:26:57,617 --> 00:27:00,537
琳赛告诉过我你爸的事儿
Lindsey told us about your dad.

262
00:27:00,537 --> 00:27:02,417
其实还有你妈妈的事儿也告诉我了
And your mum actually.

263
00:27:04,897 --> 00:27:07,177
嗯  没错  我们家一点儿也不完美
Hmmm, yeah, it's not ideal.

264
00:27:14,897 --> 00:27:16,217
你很期待当爸爸对吗
So are you looking forward to being a dad?

265
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:18,817
太兴奋了  兴奋得不得了
Buzzing, buzzing.

266
00:27:18,817 --> 00:27:21,297
我都迫不及待了
Everything about it, I can't wait.

267
00:27:24,937 --> 00:27:27,297
我记得....
I remember...

268
00:27:27,297 --> 00:27:29,457
当琳赛出生的时候
when Lindsey was born.

269
00:27:29,457 --> 00:27:31,657
我爱死她身上的气味了
I loved the smell of her.

270
00:27:31,657 --> 00:27:34,457
我就不停的闻着她的头
I kept smelling her head.

271
00:27:35,697 --> 00:27:40,097
我还记得把她带回家第一天的时候
Actually, I remember the first day when I got her back home,

272
00:27:40,097 --> 00:27:45,257
我就那么看着她  然后在想“我到底该怎么做啊”
I was just looking at her thinking,
"What on earth am I going to do?"

273
00:27:45,257 --> 00:27:49,017
我真不知道该怎么办  我当时吓坏了
I really didn't know,I was terrified.

274
00:27:49,017 --> 00:27:51,017
我当时都呆若木鸡了
Petrified I was.

275
00:27:51,017 --> 00:27:53,057
我那时候都二十四岁了
And I was 24 then!

276
00:27:53,057 --> 00:27:57,097
我那时差不多都比你们大了十岁
That's, like, nearly ten years older than yous two.

277
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:04,377
还有好多事要考虑  因为我现在几乎什么都不懂
Nah, there's a lot to think about, cos
there's so much I don't know about yet.

278
00:28:04,377 --> 00:28:08,177
我已经乱了手脚
Yeah, there's no sort of real way of preparing.

279
00:28:08,177 --> 00:28:10,177
你们会挺过去的
You'll be all right.

280
00:28:16,937 --> 00:28:18,977
我喜欢这个颜色
I like the colour.

281
00:28:18,977 --> 00:28:20,577
是吗
Do you?

282
00:28:20,577 --> 00:28:22,457
这叫做尘糖灰
It's called dusted fondant.

283
00:28:22,457 --> 00:28:24,457
尘糖灰  是这么叫的没错吧
Dusted fondant, is that right?

284
00:28:28,697 --> 00:28:31,737
- 你真喜欢吗  - 当然了  老弟
- Do you really like it? - Yeah, I do, mate.

285
00:28:32,037 --> 00:28:33,137
琳赛选的
Lindsey chose it.

286
00:28:33,137 --> 00:28:35,377
她学过这方面的东西  老兄
Course she did, mate.

287
00:28:35,377 --> 00:28:36,577
她品味不错嘛  对吧
She's got taste, ain't she?

288
00:28:36,577 --> 00:28:37,977
你什么时候才见她
When are you going to meet her?

289
00:28:37,977 --> 00:28:41,977
随便什么时候都行  你看你  滴的到处都是
Whenever, mate. Here, it's dripping all over the shop, man.

290
00:28:41,977 --> 00:28:46,937
诀窍在于要涂得均匀  然后再不停地滚压  知道吗
The trick is get as much on the wall as
possible, and then roll, fucking roll, yeah.

291
00:28:48,497 --> 00:28:50,497
- 我就是这样做的  - 你才不是
- I was. - You weren't.

292
00:28:53,657 --> 00:28:57,337
我先去四周看看你住的地段如何
Nah, just came round to see what
the place is like for you anyway.

293
00:28:57,337 --> 00:29:00,297
- 我马上就去了  - 你不用去的  就留在原地待命就好了
- I'm going now.- You don't have to,man,stick about.

294
00:29:00,297 --> 00:29:02,817
我想去喝一杯  跟我一起去如何
I'm going for a pint. Come with me?

295
00:29:02,817 --> 00:29:05,937
哦~  不了  我还是留在这儿吧
Ohhh! Nah, I'm going to stick around.

296
00:29:05,937 --> 00:29:07,817
我还得刷墙呢
I've got to paint.

297
00:29:07,817 --> 00:29:10,937
这地方不错  老弟
Sweet place you got here, mate.

298
00:29:10,937 --> 00:29:13,617
艾利克斯  待会儿庆祝一下这个地方竣工
Alex, cheers for sorting this place out, man.

299
00:29:13,617 --> 00:29:15,977
- 不了  没什么大不了的  - 不行  这对我很重要
- Nah,it's nothing,mate. - No,it's everything,mate.

300
00:29:15,977 --> 00:29:18,017
好吧  那待会儿见吧
All right, I'll see you later, yeah.

301
00:29:23,337 --> 00:29:26,177
- 他没你想的那样高尚  - 啊
- He's not as noble as you think,you know. - Huh?

302
00:29:26,177 --> 00:29:30,377
你哥啊  有时候你搞得他跟基督再临一样
Your brother. Sometimes you act like he's second coming or something.

303
00:29:30,377 --> 00:29:32,017
- 去你妹的  - 这是真的
- Fuck off! - Nah, its true.

304
00:29:32,017 --> 00:29:35,337
自从我遇到你开始  你就一直在说“我哥这样做的”
Ever since I've met you it's always been, "My brother does this.

305
00:29:35,337 --> 00:29:37,777
“我哥又是那样做的  我哥是当兵的”
"My brother does that. My brother's off in't army.

306
00:29:37,777 --> 00:29:39,597
“我哥甚至可以把水变成他娘的红酒”
"My brother can turn water into fucking wine."

307
00:29:39,597 --> 00:29:40,897
卡尔  老兄...
Carl, mate...

308
00:29:47,497 --> 00:29:49,577
你搬到这儿来你老爸怎么看
So what's your dad saying about you getting this place anyway?

309
00:29:49,577 --> 00:29:52,617
这没什么关系  对吧
It doesn't really matter really, does it?

310
00:29:52,617 --> 00:29:54,397
我们想你回果园了  你知道吗
We're missing you down at grove, you know.

311
00:29:54,397 --> 00:29:55,297
是这样吗
Is that right?

312
00:29:55,297 --> 00:29:58,017
是的  我们还有了新的成员
Yeah. We've got some new recruits as well, yeah.

313
00:29:58,017 --> 00:30:00,337
说实话  他们淫荡得跟婊子一样
They are as dirty as fuck, honestly.

314
00:30:02,737 --> 00:30:05,777
我挺为你高兴的  卡尔  真的  老兄
I'm pleased for you, Carl, mate, seriously.

315
00:30:05,777 --> 00:30:08,617
是你错过了机会
It's you that's missing out.

316
00:30:13,977 --> 00:30:16,417
这个鬼颜色太诡异了
This fucking colour's horrible.

317
00:30:53,337 --> 00:30:57,337
我们做到了  琳  我们有了自己的家
We did it, Linds, we've got our own home.

318
00:31:17,217 --> 00:31:19,017
你还好吗
Are you OK?

319
00:31:30,897 --> 00:31:33,457
需要我帮拿点什么吗
Can I get you anything?

320
00:31:33,457 --> 00:31:35,937
我待会儿要吃个三明治
I'll have a sandwich later.

321
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:38,457
好吧
OK.

322
00:31:43,537 --> 00:31:45,777
你想要枕头吗
You want to get one of them pillows?

323
00:31:46,937 --> 00:31:51,457
- 你说什么  - 枕头啊  特别是靠枕
- You what? - These pillows,especially for backs.

324
00:31:51,457 --> 00:31:53,697
专门为孕妇准备的那种
For pregnant people.

325
00:31:54,697 --> 00:31:56,217
别闹了
Clown.

326
00:32:03,497 --> 00:32:06,217
那你想要个婴儿车吗
Ah, you want one of them buggies, as well.

327
00:32:06,217 --> 00:32:08,297
就像这样的...
You know, they're proper like...

328
00:32:10,857 --> 00:32:14,577
看起来就像外太空来的一样
They look like they're from outer space or summat.

329
00:32:18,817 --> 00:32:23,817
我要给我们俩买一个  我有一百英镑
Nah, I'm going to get us one of them. I've got hundred pound.

330
00:32:25,337 --> 00:32:26,857
哪儿来的
How?

331
00:32:28,457 --> 00:32:29,977
我爸之前给的
My dad.

332
00:32:31,857 --> 00:32:37,097
都放了好久了  可是我之前不知道怎么花
I've had it ages, I just hadn't known what to do with it.

333
00:32:37,097 --> 00:32:38,777
但现在我知道了
Until now.

334
00:32:39,777 --> 00:32:44,177
但婴儿车比一百英镑还要贵一点  琳
They're a bit more expensive than a hundred quid, Linds.

335
00:32:44,177 --> 00:32:45,697
闭嘴啦
Shut up.

336
00:32:52,097 --> 00:32:54,937
- 你想做个足底按摩吗  - 不想
- Do you want a foot massage? - No.

337
00:32:56,657 --> 00:32:59,137
那我帮你放洗澡水如何
How about I run you a bath?

338
00:33:02,697 --> 00:33:04,737
这个不错
Cool.

339
00:33:04,737 --> 00:33:07,417
- 行吗  - 行吧
- Yeah? - OK.

340
00:33:07,417 --> 00:33:08,937
现在就洗吗

341
00:33:08,937 --> 00:33:11,337
- 嗯  - 好吧
- Yeah. - OK.

342
00:33:51,337 --> 00:33:53,657
你在想什么呢
What are you thinking?

343
00:33:59,417 --> 00:34:00,937
很多事
Lots.

344
00:35:17,817 --> 00:35:20,577
啊  你作弊
Ah, cheating.

345
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:21,977
你知道我最欣赏你哪点嘛  老兄
You know what I admire about you, mate?

346
00:35:22,077 --> 00:35:23,777
哪点
What's that?

347
00:35:23,777 --> 00:35:25,897
你总是很支持每一个人
The fact that you're so supportive over everyone.

348
00:35:25,897 --> 00:35:27,857
- 什么意思  - 比如说...
- What do you mean? - Like...

349
00:35:27,857 --> 00:35:31,617
我也说不清楚  陪琳赛去做她的事  游泳啊
I don't know, take the stuff with Lindsey, with her and her swimming.

350
00:35:32,017 --> 00:35:33,337
- 是跳水  - 什么
- Diving. - What?

351
00:35:33,337 --> 00:35:36,337
- 是跳水  - 有什么区别吗
- Diving. - What's difference?

352
00:35:36,337 --> 00:35:38,657
不  说真的  你明白我的意思吗  你总是依着她
No, really. D'ya know what I mean? You've always helped her out.

353
00:35:38,657 --> 00:35:41,977
你现在还真是有一个男人的样子了
I mean, you've proper shown how much of a man you can be now.

354
00:35:41,977 --> 00:35:43,037
听起来怎么不对劲儿呢
Sound sour.

355
00:35:43,037 --> 00:35:48,537
特别是她回去之后  就更需要得到支持了  对吧
Yeah, man,especially with her going back into it,
she needs all the support she can get. Eh?

356
00:35:48,537 --> 00:35:50,457
我是说她回去游泳的事儿
I mean with her going back into swimming.

357
00:35:50,457 --> 00:35:52,657
是跳水  谁告诉你的
Diving. Who told you that?

358
00:35:52,657 --> 00:35:54,497
我自己看见的
I've seen it meself.

359
00:35:54,497 --> 00:35:55,397
是吗
Eh?

360
00:35:55,397 --> 00:35:59,697
对  昨天我回体育馆的时候路过泳池看见她在那儿
Yeah,yesterday, I came back from gym and

361
00:35:59,697 --> 00:36:01,537
不  她告诉我她回娘家去了
Oh, no, she's sacked it off, that's what she told me.

362
00:36:01,537 --> 00:36:03,937
不  她没有
No, she ain't.

363
00:36:03,937 --> 00:36:06,137
你怎么了

364
00:36:06,137 --> 00:36:08,217

Rob, don't be a dick, what's up with ya? Rob.

367
00:36:21,097 --> 00:36:23,137
那个人跳得很好  是吧
That was a good un', wasn't it?

368
00:36:25,457 --> 00:36:27,897
还不赖
Not bad,

369
00:36:27,897 --> 00:36:30,137
但不及琳赛
not as good as Lindsey.

370
00:36:32,977 --> 00:36:36,457
- 你来这儿干嘛  - 我听说你在这儿
- What are you doing here? - I heard you was here.

371
00:36:38,417 --> 00:36:41,497
我以为你去你妈妈家里了呢  琳
I thought you was going to your mum's, Linds.

372
00:36:41,497 --> 00:36:44,297
你就是那样告诉我的
That was what you told me.

373
00:36:46,297 --> 00:36:47,817
我知道
I know.

374
00:36:47,817 --> 00:36:49,457
抱歉
I'm sorry.

375
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,817
你来这儿干嘛呢
What are you doing here?

376
00:36:51,817 --> 00:36:53,617
罗柏...
Robert...

377
00:36:53,617 --> 00:36:56,217
又是“罗柏  没事儿”吗  你他娘的到底在这儿干嘛呢
Robert nothing.What the fuck are you doing here?

378
00:36:56,217 --> 00:36:58,257
嘿  够了啊
Hey, that's enough.

379
00:37:02,097 --> 00:37:04,177
我想回来
I want to come back.

380
00:37:08,937 --> 00:37:11,297
我想回来继续跳水
I want to go back to diving.

381
00:37:12,817 --> 00:37:16,817
当然不是现在  我是说等孩子出生之后
I mean,not now.Obviously.But when the baby's born.

382
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:19,057
当孩子出生的时候吗
When the baby's born?

383
00:37:19,057 --> 00:37:21,057
我准备回来
I'm going to.

384
00:37:24,017 --> 00:37:25,397
我们讨论了
We've talked about it.

385
00:37:25,397 --> 00:37:27,497
- 你们讨论过了吗  真是好啊  - 罗柏
- Have you? Lovely. -  Robert.

386
00:37:27,497 --> 00:37:30,217
-你跟她说了些什么  - 罗柏  别这样
- What have you been talking about? - Robert,please.

387
00:37:30,217 --> 00:37:33,257
我在跟她说要是在九个月之内回来
I've been saying that if she comes back within nine months,

388
00:37:33,257 --> 00:37:36,337
她还有可能恢复部分水平  否则...
there's a possibility she could compete at regional level or...

389
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,257
这样对吗
Is that right?

390
00:37:38,257 --> 00:37:40,817
当然是对的
Yeah, it's absolutely right.

391
00:37:40,817 --> 00:37:42,177
太可怕了
Terrific.

392
00:37:51,857 --> 00:37:57,297
虽然我觉得我不可能再在奥运团队里争夺一席之地
I mean, I don't think I'll be in contention for a
place on the Olympic team, but, you know,

393
00:37:57,297 --> 00:37:59,877
但我想在休息三周之后就回去继续训练
I was thinking I could be back in training after a three-week rest.

394
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:01,777
三周
Three weeks?

395
00:38:01,777 --> 00:38:03,377
对  宝拉・拉德克利夫也是在两年后才复出的
Yeah, Paula Radcliffe was back in after two

396
00:38:03,377 --> 00:38:06,377
而且我比她当时年轻得多
and I'm miles younger than she was.

397
00:38:09,857 --> 00:38:12,457
那他怎么办  琳
What are you going to do with him, Linds, man?

398
00:38:14,337 --> 00:38:17,617
你就把他放在池子边
You just going to sit him here by the pool,

399
00:38:17,617 --> 00:38:21,217
把才三周大还在襁褓里的孩子跟记分卡和红牛放在一起
three weeks old with a towel, Lucozade and a scorecard?

400
00:38:22,937 --> 00:38:26,297
我想国家游泳队肯定能帮我找到一家好的孤儿院的
I bet British Swimming would find me a dead good creche.

401
00:38:26,297 --> 00:38:28,737
还有  我希望你别再叫它作“他”
I wish you'd stop calling it a he.

402
00:39:33,257 --> 00:39:34,857
哪儿
Where?

403
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,617
哦  今天真是我的幸运日
Oh, my days!

404
00:39:58,457 --> 00:40:00,497
快点  快跑啊
Come on, move!

405
00:40:33,657 --> 00:40:36,537
罗柏
Robert?

406
00:40:37,537 --> 00:40:40,377
啊  琳  这是艾利克斯
Ah, Linds, this is Alex.

407
00:40:41,377 --> 00:40:43,817
你好  很高兴见到你
Hello, love, pleased to meet you.

408
00:40:46,497 --> 00:40:50,857
- 他要在这儿呆几晚上  - 是吗
- He's going to stay for a couple of nights. - Is he?

409
00:40:50,857 --> 00:40:53,497
我可是久闻你的大名呢  琳赛
I've heard lots of things about you, Lindsey.

410
00:40:54,497 --> 00:40:58,097
- 是吗  - 对  听过你好多事儿呢
- Have ya? - Yeah,lots of good things,yeah,yeah.

411
00:40:58,097 --> 00:41:01,097
你是跳水运动员  对吧
You're into diving, aren't ya?

412
00:41:01,097 --> 00:41:03,497
嗯  这真是非常棒  真的
Yeah, that's really good, that is.

413
00:41:03,497 --> 00:41:05,737
好得不得了  简直太赞了
Dead good, I think that's brilliant.

414
00:41:06,977 --> 00:41:08,897
我自己其实对跳水不是很了解
I don't really know much about it myself.

415
00:41:08,897 --> 00:41:12,897
我之前遇到的人但是玩跳水戏法的
All I've ever come across is...muff diving.

416
00:41:21,297 --> 00:41:24,657
- 天呐  她都不笑的吗  - 别这样  老哥
- Oh,my god,does she have a laugh? - Mate,please.

417
00:41:24,657 --> 00:41:27,897
- 她的脸就跟冰块一样  - 跳水戏法
- Her face was like concrete. - Muff diving!

418
00:41:30,817 --> 00:41:33,617
他为什么不待在你爸家
Why isn't he staying at your dad's?

419
00:41:33,617 --> 00:41:35,857
什么
What?

420
00:41:35,857 --> 00:41:39,297
要是他想搬出来的话为什么不搬到你爸那儿去
If he's had to move out, why isn't he staying at your dad's?

421
00:41:42,497 --> 00:41:45,497
这个房子可是他帮我们找到的  你知道吗  琳赛
It was his mate that found us this place, you know, Lindsey.

422
00:41:47,497 --> 00:41:53,897
你就行行好  他就在自己找到房子之前住几晚而已
It's only for a couple of nights until he
gets himself sorted out, for Christ's sake.

423
00:41:55,697 --> 00:41:59,257
- 最好是这样  - 他是我哥  你知道吗
- It had better be. - He's my brother, you know.

424
00:42:13,177 --> 00:42:15,017
四十五分钟了
That's 45 minutes.

425
00:42:17,217 --> 00:42:19,297
- 她去哪儿了  - 先别管了  小柏
- Where is she? - Ah, just leave it now, Bob.

426
00:42:19,297 --> 00:42:21,597
- 不  这都放学四十五分钟了  - 有吃的吗  我饿死了
- No, what could she be doing for 45 minutes?
- Any food? I'm starving.

427
00:42:21,597 --> 00:42:25,297
- 有  在那儿  - 在那边那个碗橱里吗
- Yes, up there. - That cupboard there?

428
00:42:25,297 --> 00:42:27,537
你都住了一周了  而且现在都放学四十五分钟了
It's a week night, man, and this is 45 minutes after school.

429
00:42:27,537 --> 00:42:30,537
好了  我们之前不是讨论过了吗
There we go.That's what I'm talking about.

430
00:42:30,537 --> 00:42:33,897
- 你在干嘛  - 我要做军队汤
- What you doing? - I'm making army stew.

431
00:42:33,897 --> 00:42:36,857
喔喔喔   咖喱羊肉加豆子  老兄
Woah, woah, woah, jalfrezi and beans, man.

432
00:42:36,857 --> 00:42:37,837
对  老弟  咖喱羊肉加豆子
Yes, mate, jalfrezi and beans.

433
00:42:37,837 --> 00:42:38,537
还有芽呢
And sprouts.

434
00:42:38,537 --> 00:42:42,537
对  还有芽  这才是好的军队汤
Yeah, and sprouts and all, it's good Army stew,

435
00:42:42,537 --> 00:42:44,657
咱有一大壶呢
everything you've got all in the same pot.

436
00:42:46,177 --> 00:42:47,097
再说一遍
Come again?

437
00:42:47,097 --> 00:42:49,297
我说我们有一大罐呢
I said everything you've got in the same pot.

438
00:42:54,417 --> 00:42:56,657
我不知道我是否买过这个
I don't know if I'm buying that, mate.

439
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:58,857
- 没试过之前先别做评价  - 这可不太好
- Don't knock it till you've tried it. - That's not good.

440
00:42:58,857 --> 00:42:59,497
没试过之前先别做评价
Don't knock it till you've tried it.

441
00:42:59,497 --> 00:43:01,297
- 那个真看起来不太好  - 不  很好吃的
- That's not good at all. - Yes, it is.

442
00:43:01,297 --> 00:43:04,817
- 哦  闻起来好脏的样子  这可不妙  - 听着  老弟...
- Oh,that smells dirty,that's wrong. - Listen,mate...

443
00:43:05,817 --> 00:43:07,777
哦  你去哪儿了
Oh, where've you been?

444
00:43:10,777 --> 00:43:12,617
游泳池
At the pool.

445
00:43:12,617 --> 00:43:15,537
什么  你跟艾莉森在一起吗
What, was you with Alison, yeah?

446
00:43:15,537 --> 00:43:17,317
罗柏  我爱做什么就做什么
Robert,I can do what the fuck I like.

447
00:43:17,317 --> 00:43:19,817
- 是吗  - 对
- Can ya? - Yeah.

448
00:43:19,817 --> 00:43:22,337
那好吧
All right then.

449
00:43:26,097 --> 00:43:28,617
继续去呀
Go on then.

450
00:43:35,137 --> 00:43:37,737
抱歉  是我出毛病了还是怎么了
Sorry, was I out of order then or something?

451
00:43:43,417 --> 00:43:46,217
我一点都不滑稽  但这我就听到这么点东西了
I'm not being funny, mate, but that's all I hear.

452
00:43:46,217 --> 00:43:49,137
去他娘的跳水  跳水  跳水  哦~  操你大爷的跳水
Fucking diving. Diving. Diving. Oh, fucking diving.

453
00:43:49,137 --> 00:43:51,497
难道她该待在家吗  是吗
Oh,yeah,cos she should stay at home,shouldn't she?

454
00:43:51,497 --> 00:43:55,337
是的  她该留在家里打扫房间  为你做饭  对吗
Yeah, cook your dinner for you, clean the
pots after an' all, shouldn't she, yeah?

455
00:43:56,037 --> 00:43:57,337
不是的  老哥
No, mate.

456
00:44:03,937 --> 00:44:06,697
我只是不想让她影响到我们的孩子
I just don't think she's that bothered about our baby.

457
00:44:06,697 --> 00:44:08,337
我告诉你  你有麻烦了  老弟
I tell you what, you've got problems, mate.

458
00:44:08,337 --> 00:44:10,937
啊  真他大爷的臭死人了  艾利克斯
Ah, that fucking stinks of shit, Alex.

459
00:44:14,017 --> 00:44:16,457
从这上面可以俯瞰整个沃尔沃斯了  老弟
Might look very Waltons from the outside, mate,

460
00:44:16,457 --> 00:44:23,377
你有尘糖灰的托儿所跟宜家成套的平装餐桌  但我看得出来
with your dusted fondant nursery and your Ikea fucking
flat-pack fucking dinner set,but I can see it,mate.

461
00:44:23,377 --> 00:44:25,457
尽管你有心
You ain't in control,

462
00:44:25,457 --> 00:44:27,897
但却无能为力
and you want to be.

463
00:44:27,897 --> 00:44:28,857
你在说什么呢
What are you on about?

464
00:44:28,857 --> 00:44:32,057
她会为她想要的不惜一切代价
She's going to do whatever the fuck she wants in life

465
00:44:32,057 --> 00:44:35,177
你绝对不可能有办法阻止得了她
and there's absolutely nothing you can do to stop her.

466
00:44:36,697 --> 00:44:40,457
女人就是这样  罗柏  你现在应该明白这点
That's what women do, Robert, you should know that by now.

467
00:44:41,977 --> 00:44:44,057
你得放开她的手
And you need to let her.

468
00:44:45,297 --> 00:44:46,137
但是你能做的到吗
But can you?

469
00:44:47,137 --> 00:44:50,137
我敢说你根本都不清楚你到底在说什么  老哥
I don't even think you know what you're on about now, mate.

470
00:44:50,137 --> 00:44:52,617
好吧  那你爱她吗
All right, do ya love her?

471
00:44:52,617 --> 00:44:55,617
- 你爱吗  - 爱
- Do ya? - Yeah.

472
00:44:55,617 --> 00:44:58,017
那还真是感人哦  老弟  太感人了
That's dead touching that, mate. Really touching.

473
00:44:58,017 --> 00:44:59,937
你什么都不重视  你根本不
You don't take anything seriously, you don't.

474
00:44:59,937 --> 00:45:02,857
你得让她去做她想做的事儿
You need to let her do what she wants to do, yeah.

475
00:45:02,857 --> 00:45:06,097
还有你的孩子  她爱干嘛你就让她干嘛
And your baby. She needs to do whatever she wants to do an all.

476
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:12,817
- 他是个男孩  - 好吧  他...他需要自己去做决定
- He.- All right,he -he needs to make his own decisions.

477
00:45:18,017 --> 00:45:20,017
你得自己走出来  老弟
You need to sort yourself out, mate.

478
00:45:21,857 --> 00:45:24,097
再说一句  我不久之后就要走了
Anyway, I'll be gone soon,

479
00:45:24,097 --> 00:45:26,817
我在这儿待够了
I've had enough of it around here.

480
00:45:54,977 --> 00:45:57,097
你要去泳池吗
You going to the pool?

481
00:47:21,177 --> 00:47:23,177
你还好吗  小柏
You all right, Rob?

482
00:47:27,937 --> 00:47:29,457
我不知道
I dunno.

483
00:47:33,337 --> 00:47:35,937
你想进来吗
Do you want to come inside?

484
00:47:45,057 --> 00:47:47,297
嗯
Yeah.

485
00:48:17,897 --> 00:48:19,817
琳
Linds.

486
00:49:11,057 --> 00:49:13,897
琳  世界上有很多人...
There are people in the world, Linds, that...

487
00:49:14,897 --> 00:49:17,177
都是旅者
..that are travellers.

488
00:49:19,657 --> 00:49:22,377
他们什么也不图...
They want shit and...

489
00:49:22,377 --> 00:49:25,377
他们就到处旅游  到处看...
they go places and-and see...

490
00:49:26,897 --> 00:49:28,617
看风景
..see stuff.

491
00:49:30,617 --> 00:49:32,937
艾利克斯就是这样
Alex is like that,

492
00:49:32,937 --> 00:49:35,497
我们的妈妈也是
so was our mum.

493
00:49:35,497 --> 00:49:37,537
我猜你也是
And I reckon you are too.

494
00:49:43,257 --> 00:49:48,217
但有些人并不是那样的
But then there's people that just aren't.

495
00:49:50,457 --> 00:49:53,737
但他们不是坏人  琳  我不是个坏人
They're not bad people,Linds.I'm not a bad person.

496
00:49:57,897 --> 00:50:00,297
他们想稍微驻足
They just want to stay still for a bit.

497
00:50:06,617 --> 00:50:08,777
我觉得我就更像那种人一点
I think that's more like me.

498
00:50:11,937 --> 00:50:16,897
我想我们与众不同   琳  我想我们一直在一起
I wanted us to be different, Lindsey.I wanted us to be together all along,

499
00:50:16,897 --> 00:50:20,057
但是...要比现在更好一点
but...for it to be a bit better.

500
00:51:01,217 --> 00:51:03,497
你还好吗  老兄  好吧
Aright,mate? All right.

501
00:51:04,197 --> 00:51:07,497
还以为你被宵禁了呢  你今晚不工作了还是怎么着
Thought you was on curfew. Is it your night off tonight or something?

502
00:51:07,497 --> 00:51:09,497
你丫的闭嘴  拉兹
Fucking shut it, Raz.

503
00:51:13,937 --> 00:51:15,817
老兄...
Mate...

504
00:51:17,257 --> 00:51:19,257
我听说琳赛的事儿了
..I heard about Lindsey.

505
00:51:19,257 --> 00:51:21,257
抱歉  老兄
I'm sorry, man.

506
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:27,137
- 要喝啤酒吗  - 不了  老兄  不用了
- Want a beer? - Nah, mate, nah.

507
00:51:27,137 --> 00:51:29,897
很高兴能看到你回来  老兄
Good to see you back here, man.

508
00:51:29,897 --> 00:51:32,057
我马上就走  老兄
I ain't sticking about, mate.

509
00:51:35,777 --> 00:51:37,497
注意安全  知道吗
Keep safe, yeah?

510
00:51:37,497 --> 00:51:40,977
- 有需要就打给我  - 再会了  卡尔
- If you need owt,give us a bell. - See you later,Carl.

511
00:53:49,937 --> 00:53:55,177
祝贺你  是个可爱的男孩
Congratulations on him.He's a lovely little boy.

512
00:53:55,177 --> 00:53:58,657
用你手臂环抱住他的脖子就行了
Just put your arm around him to support his neck.

513
00:53:58,657 --> 00:54:02,697
- 放松一点  别抱那么紧  - 天呐
- Just relax, back down. - Oh, my goodness me.

514
00:54:03,977 --> 00:54:06,617
- 你想抱一下他吗  - 当然想
- Do you want to take him? - Yeah.

515
00:54:06,617 --> 00:54:07,977
我该怎么递给他
How do I pass him?

516
00:54:07,977 --> 00:54:14,057
你就伸出手搂住他的头就行
If you just hold your arms out and just really support his head.

517
00:54:17,177 --> 00:54:18,657
哦~  嘘~
Oh, shush.

518
00:54:44,617 --> 00:54:46,137
你在想什么呢
What are you thinking about?

519
00:54:48,257 --> 00:54:49,777
什么
What?

520
00:54:51,977 --> 00:54:54,057
你看起来若有所思的样子
You looked very thoughtful.

521
00:54:58,417 --> 00:55:00,377
我在想他呢
I was thinking about him.

522
00:55:04,817 --> 00:55:06,137
还有你
And you.

523
00:55:08,737 --> 00:55:10,657
