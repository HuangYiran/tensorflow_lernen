00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and let's show the world that the pen is truly mightier than the sword.

103
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

104
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:20,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}President Sawyer delivered what can only be described as a historic speech...

105
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- ...earlier today in Geneva. - Here.

106
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:25,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Let's go live... - You changed your hair.

107
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Last week.

108
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna be late tonight.

109
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love you very much.

110
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good morning,sir.

111
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:50,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}John,what do you think of the president's proposal?

112
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. It's good to have less enemies,I guess.

113
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're a military man. You don't think he's putting us at risk?

114
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a little above my pay grade. If you feel that way...

115
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- ...why didn't you run against him? - No,no,no.

116
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's one job I never wanted. I like my office.

117
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I like my constituents.

118
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I like being a thorn in the side of the administration.

119
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:10,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I think voters today want somebody cool.

120
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:14,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,come on,Mr. Speaker,I think you're pretty cool.

121
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He went to bed at 8 and watched...

122
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The president has a call scheduled with the speaker at 9:30.

123
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I should be there for that,shouldn't I? - No.Sir.

124
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have to be here in case of a deadlock...

125
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey,I'm gonna see you later.

126
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...With the red tie for that.

127
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:33,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Jenna? - Absolutely,Mr. Vice President.

128
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:36,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Red tie's the way to go.

129
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:39,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jenna. Jenna. Did you get me in?

130
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What do I get if I did? - What do you want?

131
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dinner. Candlelight.

132
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:47,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And a promise that you will try to get to second base.

133
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Done.

134
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're meeting with Carol Finnerty,deputy special agent...

135
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...in charge of the president's Secret Service.

136
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I need a favour. - This is a favour.

137
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:59,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need another favour. I need a pass for my daughter.

138
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- John... - You don't understand.

139
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:05,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's a freak for this kind of stuff,so if I get her in,I'm Dad of the Year.

140
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I will owe you so much more than just candlelight dinner.

141
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'll make a call. - Perfect. Thank you. You're the best.

142
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...a truly historic handshake.

143
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What President Sawyer is proposing to Iranian president Al-Sharif...

144
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:52,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...is withdrawing all American troops across the entire Middle East...

145
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:55,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and for that he'll ask his G8 partners for help.

146
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's all about money,and who won't like this deal...

147
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:01,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...are American companies who do business with the American military.

148
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:04,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wanna grab the door? Em.

149
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll get it.

150
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hey. - You're late.

151
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- She thought you weren't coming. - Why wouldn't I be coming?

152
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:17,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey,you,little face. Come on,get your stuff. Let's go,baby.

153
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Bye,Mommy. I love you. - I love you too,sweetie.

154
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:25,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's up...?

155
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I literally just walked in the door. What did I do?

156
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You missed her talent show.

157
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,I didn't miss it. That's,like,next Thursday.

158
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,it was last Thursday.

159
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was on the school calendar.

160
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did she do?

161
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She was a flag twirler.

162
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a talent?

163
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:53,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She practised for like six weeks,John. She thought you were gonna be there.

164
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It would've been really nice to have a bit of a reminder.

165
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:00,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Come on,I'm not your secretary,John. - I'm not asking you to be my secretary.

166
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look,I'm just... I'm trying.

167
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm trying really hard to be in her life.

168
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a little late for that,wouldn't you say?

169
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have a good day.

170
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you mad at me?

171
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:19,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just tell me.

172
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will you be on that all day long?

173
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:32,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Yes." Well,that sucks,because,you know,I thought you would...

174
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:34,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- ...want this,but... - Lame.

175
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't even know what it is.

176
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you really think a bribe's gonna work?

177
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. I'm hoping so.

178
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:46,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We're both adults here,John. - Speak for yourself,okay?

179
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you please just open it?

180
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- For me? - What is it?

181
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:55,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a pony,baby. I don't... Come on,for me,please just...

182
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These are White House passes.

183
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:07,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. That might mean we're going to the White House.

184
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:09,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that your dad here has a job interview...

185
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...with the Secret Service.

186
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is really cool,John.

187
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You're just gonna stick with "John"? - Yeah.

188
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now The Roger Skinner Show,today live from the White House.

189
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:27,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi,folks. President Sawyer is one of those academics...

190
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...who never served a day in his life...

191
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and now he wants to tell the military how to run things?

192
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:35,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's going to make peace with Iran because he has friends there now?

193
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

194
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sir,I have the first lady for you.

195
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remind me again why we let these guys broadcast from our lawn.

196
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Freedom of the press. - You know what?

197
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I knew it was something.

198
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey,babe. How are the French taking it?

199
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The treaty's gonna be a tough sell here.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes,and you should be ashamed of yourself.

273
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a recession,okay?

274

278
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:08,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and you were wounded in the Kunar province.

279
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yes,ma'am. - You received a Silver Star...

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...for pulling a Corporal Dawson from a burning Humvee?

281
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There was an IED attack.

282

00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:24,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...that he was getting a little too warm in there.

285
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's funny to me,you still think glib is the way to go here.

286
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:31,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Corporal Dawson is the nephew of the speaker of the house...

287
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:33,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and when you were discharged a year ago...

00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:54,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}John,why do you want to be in the Secret Service?

293
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:59,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't think of a more important job than protecting the president.

294

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great.

300
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:20,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah,John,you barely maintained a C average.

301
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:23,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry,I didn't have our little study sessions...

302
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...like we used to back in the day,did I?

303
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:27,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Evaluations from your senior officers:

304
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:30,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Cale frequently does not complete his field reports on time."

305
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing to do with protecting someone.

306
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:35,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Sergeant Cale demonstrates a lack of respect for authority."

307
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:39,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Sergeant Cale has raw potential but seems determined not to realise it."

308
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:42,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can keep reading that. That is not me anymore.

309
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not the kid you used to know in college.

310
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:48,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've buttoned up every single thing that I have to to qualify for this job.

311
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:51,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have 10 times more experience than any Ivy League kid.

312
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:55,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not just about experience. I would need to depend on you every day.

313
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you want me to do?

314
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll start at the... I'll start at the bottom.

315
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just give me a chance.

316
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.

317
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you get the job?

318
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:25,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah,I think I got a shot. - Really?

319
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:27,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know how it is.

320
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:30,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They gotta go talk amongst themselves and...

321
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:34,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These... Look,these things,they can be really political.

322
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:12,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good morning. Light day at the White House today.

323
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eagle will remain on the 18 acres.

324
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He has phone calls to the congressional leadership.

325
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}First lady is back tonight?

326
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Empress is wheels down at 1845.

327
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're supposed to have dinner at the residence,but you know how they are.

328
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:29,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So we should have an advance on Obelisk,Marcel's,the usual.

329
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What if she wants sushi? - No,no,she's off sushi.

330
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember she had that thing on the Japan trip?

331
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:38,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Carol,how are you still awake? - Caffeine and patriotism,sir.

332
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Threat matrix? - Well...

333
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:43,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...threats against POTUS have quadrupled since the G8 speech.

334
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}PID is keeping an eye on a guy in Buffalo they're worried about.

335
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Visitors today? - Just the AV guys again.

336
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:52,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}DC Sonic,they're replacing the surround system in the theatre.

337
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:55,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- First lady must be thrilled. - And she's...

338
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's coming back tonight?

339
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Carol,is she coming back tonight?

340
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:07,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes,sir. Wheels down at 18:45.

341
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:10,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes,of course.

342
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As many of you are well-aware,this is my last week here...

343
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...so I wanna make this clear to everybody:

344
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:19,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If there are any congratulatory cakes or any of that nonsense...

345
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:23,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...I will be compelled to use deadly force.

346
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hate you. I hate you all.

347
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:37,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you. No incendiaries in the White House.

348
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right,baby,I just gotta get my weapon real quick.

349
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're gonna have to sign out,sir. Hello.

350
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:45,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You guys here for the tour?

351
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:47,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you think we can see where you'll be working?

352
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah,sure. - Great.

353
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gather around,everyone,gather around. My name is Donnie...

354
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:58,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and I'll be your guide today as we take a walk through American history.

355
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:02,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wanna give you all a warm Washington,D.C. welcome to the White House...

356
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:06,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...where each year we get millions of guests from every corner of the globe.

357
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are you folks from?

358
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Washington,D.C.

359
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Bad choice. What about you,ma'am? - Nebraska.

360
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What brings you to the White House?

361
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:19,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wanna see the tunnels where JFK snuck Marilyn Monroe in.

362
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:22,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Unfortunately,no such tunnels exist,but don't worry,we have plenty...

363
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...of other exciting sights to show you guys.

364
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:27,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Follow me this way.

365
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:30,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now,does anyone wanna guess how old the White House is?

366
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:32,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yes. - Two hundred and twenty-two years old.

367
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's very accurate.

368
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Construction began in 1792...

369
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:39,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...on what was then called the President's House.

370
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:42,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now,Article 1,Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution set forth...

371
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...that a district of no more than 10 miles square...

372
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...should house the new seat of government. Does anyone know why?

373
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:50,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So no one state could claim the President's House.

374
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right again. You're a real keener,aren't you?

375
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now,the founders were crafty...

376
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey,so you can tell me the truth.

377
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:00,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you get picked on a lot in school?

378
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:02,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,I don't.

379
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:10,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's a gift certificate for a massage. - I could use one.

380
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:13,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Martin,it's... It's been...

381
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:16,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know,for me too,Ted.

382
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know you're gonna miss this.

383
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:27,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- When's the last time you took a day off? - Oh,I'm fine.

384
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm fine.

385
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:33,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Piece of advice: You gotta get back on the horse.

386
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Get back on the horse? - First rule of divorce: Get right out there.

387
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:41,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sow some oats,break some hearts,have actual human interaction...

388
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...with a member of the opposite sex.

389
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:51,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Carol,you keep this up,20 years from now you're gonna look like me.

390
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,there are worse things.

391
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't make this your whole life.

392
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:57,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Trust me.

393
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not worth it.

394
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:06,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go home.

395
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get some rest.

396
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now.

397
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:13,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that is an order.

398
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes,sir.

399
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:22,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now,not too many people realise this...

400
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but the White House is actually three buildings:

401
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The East Wing where you guys came in...

402
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:30,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...the West Wing,which houses the Oval and Executive Offices...

403
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and we're about to enter the residence,which is the famous building that...

404
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:37,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- ...got blown up in Independence Day. - What's in there?

405
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's the president's home theatre. Membership has its privileges.

406
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:43,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right this way through the double doors,please.

407
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's still lots more to see.

408
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got a visitor.

409
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey.

410
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Excuse me,sir. Could you stay with the tour? - Yeah.

411
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

412
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The White House is big.

413
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Including below-ground levels,it's six storeys tall...

414
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:16,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...with 132 rooms,412 doors,147 windows,28 fireplaces...

415
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and 35 bathrooms.

416
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The grounds contain a tennis court,a basketball court...

417
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...a putting green,a jogging track and a swimming pool.

418
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- And where's the PEOC? - The what?

419
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:30,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's referring to the Presidential Emergency Operations Centre...

420
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:33,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...which is this really cool bunker behind 10 feet of concrete and steel...

421
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...that's capable of surviving a nuclear blast,plus...

422
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:39,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...for your information,miss,it's the one room in the house...

423
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...that no one knows the location of.

424
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}WikiLeaks says it's under the East Wing.

425
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:48,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who wants to see the bowling alley,huh?

426
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh,my God. - How we doing,folks?

427
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Mr. President. - How's the tour?

428
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see the basketball court?

429
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:56,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. President,can I ask you a question for my YouTube channel?

430
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:59,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That'd be all right. What's your name? - Emily Cale.

431
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Emily Cale,go ahead.

432
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:02,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Okay. - How I look on that thing?

433
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:04,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wasn't ready for a press conference.

434
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:07,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do you expect 22 Arab nations with different regional...

435
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:10,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and religious interests to agree on a single treaty...

436
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:12,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...especially given the newly erupting conflicts...

437
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:15,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...between the Shiites and the Sunnis in southern Pakistan?

438
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tough question.

439
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To be honest with you,I don't know. Whether they'll agree or not...

440
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:23,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...I'm not sure,but I gotta try.

441
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:26,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The day we stop believing different people can come together...

442
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:29,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...is the day we've given up on the world. I'm not ready to.

443
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What I am ready to do is give a little girl...

444
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:34,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...a shout-out on her YouTube blog.

445
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:37,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi,folks,my name is James W. Sawyer...

446
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and I'm here with Emily Cale and her video blog.

447
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Check it out.

448
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:43,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You have a good one. - Wait.

449
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. President,this is my dad John.

450
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:48,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's gonna be on your Secret Service detail.

451
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:50,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Secret Service detail. Is that right?

452
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:53,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know,I take my protection detail very seriously.

453
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:57,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yes,sir. - Stop lying to children.

454
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:00,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Nice to meet you,Emily. - Nice to meet you too,Mr. President.

455
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:03,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You guys have a good one. Need your vote now.

456
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,my God,that was so fun.

457
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thought you said no one says "blog" anymore,huh?

458
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bye,Fred.

459
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Goodbye,Mrs. Finnerty.

460
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:17,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oil painting by Tom Freeman to commemorate the burning...

461
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...of the White House by the British in 1814.

462
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:23,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Wait,the White House burned down? - Yeah,yeah,in the War of 1812.

463
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Practically had to be rebuilt from the ground up.

464
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:29,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When I look at this painting,I get very emotional.

465
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}John.

466
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:35,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think I need to avail myself of one of the 35 bathrooms in here.

467
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a ladies' room downstairs.

468
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:40,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Where? I'll take her. - I can go by myself,John.

469
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:41,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not a child.

470
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey,just don't touch anything or wander off...

471
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:47,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...or talk to anybody that you shouldn't be talking to.

472
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I make no promises.

473
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:50,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's seven minutes behind.

474
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:52,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry,he got hung up on the State Floor.

475
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Good morning,Margaret. - Morning,Mr. President.

476
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Could you get the speaker on the phone?

477
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right away,sir.

478
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:01,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have you and the missus zeroed in on a dining establishment?

479
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:04,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When have you known the missus to zero in on anything?

480
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fair point,sir.

481
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:08,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Martin,I wanna shake your hand.

482
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We're all sorry to see you go. - Thank you,Mr. President.

483
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I know that you and Muriel have had a tough go of it...

484
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- ...since Kevin passed,and... - We all make sacrifices...

485
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- ...for our country,sir. - Yeah,but it's more...

486
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have the speaker of the house for you.

487
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.

488
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you,Mr. President.

489
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:31,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right.

490
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Thank you,Margaret. - You're welcome,sir.

491
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:39,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Eli. - That was quite a speech,Mr. President.

492
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you were on board,we'd have a real shot at peace.

493
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:45,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You do know that your plan has upset the entire defence industry.

494
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:48,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These are powerful people who give money to both parties.

495
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:52,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I talked to President Al-Sharif again about the discussion we had...

496
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and he's assuring me that he has proof.

497
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,270

499
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:02,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...with radical regimes for years. All they wanna do is keep the cycle of war going.

500
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:05,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Al-Sharif will expose them.

501
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All of that wrongdoing is gonna come out...

00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:10,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- ...as soon as our plan is signed. - Sir,if your plan is signed.

503

505
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My supervisor told me to come this way.

506
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:33,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop.

507
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Be careful next time.

508
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:49,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know we've had our differences,but I've never known you to be a man...

509
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:52,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...to let politics stand in the way of doing the right thing.

510
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:56,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you stand with me on this,you can be the man that could take these guys down.

511
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:59,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd like to drag every one of these CEOs in front of Congress...

512
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but there's more at stake here. I can't support this,not at the risk...

513
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:04,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...of leaving us militarily exposed.

514
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on,you know those bases are for show now.

515
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We could launch a drone off of any carrier in the gulf...

516
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and hit any target we want.

517
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me,miss.

518
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sir,you can't leave that there.

519

527
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:09,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Where's the vice president? - In the chamber.

531
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:20,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's been an explosion at the Capitol building.

532

00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:27,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take care of Bobby.

699
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:33,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Killick,stop them at the elevator. - I'm on it.

700
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:38,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's in the residence! Cut him off at the residence!

701
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:40,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Son of a bitch! You screwed us,Walker.

702
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've got one of your guys running around.

703
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Not one of my guys. - Then who is he?

704
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:48,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know,probably some schmuck from one of the tours.

705
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:51,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your tourist killed one of my best men! So now I'm gonna take care of it!

706
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:55,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,you will not. You will have your boys...

707
00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:57,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...sweep every room in this place.

708
00:43:57,170 --> 00:44:00,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you will come with me,as planned.

709
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Find him.

710
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:09,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't talk to me like that in front of my men.

711
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I don't,huh? - No,you don't!

712
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:12,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ten years I've known Bobby!

713
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:15,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Twice the guy saved my life. This doesn't go unanswered!

714
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:17,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Drop the tough-guy shit with me,junior.

715
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:19,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now,I know your story,Emil.

716
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know what this country did to you.

717
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're in this together. So be calm.

718
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:25,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm calm. - Good.

719
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm still gonna kill him. - I don't have a problem with that.

720
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:31,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I need the president alive. Don't forget that.

721
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You promised me the leader of the free world.

722
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:48,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you worry your pretty little head. We'll get him back.

723
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:50,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But without him,what kind of time frame we looking at?

724
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:53,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have 15 minutes to load in,then maybe another 30 or so...

725
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:57,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...to crack the protocols without his code. After that,it's on you.

726
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What about securing the basement? - I brought a party favour for that.

727
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Good. - Do you know...

728
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:05,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...you've got a bit of something right... It's right under your nose.

729
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Vadim.

730
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You let me know the second you find these guys.

731
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:28,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Copy that.

732
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:31,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Somebody please shut the alarm off!

733
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:35,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got work to do.

734
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Motts.

735
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take Bobby's place in Air Comm.

736
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll show you the way.

737
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got some important people waiting for us.

738
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:53,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Are you okay,sir? - I'm all right.

739
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:56,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Is your family in the complex? - They won't be here till tonight.

740
00:45:56,830 --> 00:45:59,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Your daughter,where's your daughter? - I couldn't find her.

741
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hope she got out.

742
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you know these men?

743
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:06,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That old son of a bitch,his name is Martin Walker.

744
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:08,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's the head of my Secret Service.

745
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:12,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should have a conversation about how serious you take your protection.

746
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:15,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I didn't pick him. - Why is he doing this?

747
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:18,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think it has something to do with his son Kevin.

748
00:46:18,190 --> 00:46:20,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Why? What happened? - He was a Marine.

749
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:23,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He got killed last year in this covert action that I ordered.

750
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:27,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Would he do this for a personal vendetta? He said he wanted you alive.

751
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:30,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's gotta be a bigger play.

752
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We gotta get out of this elevator shaft.

753
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:35,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm...

754
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't tell me you're claustrophobic.

755
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:46,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,my God. The FAA needs to ground all air traffic.

756
00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:49,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's the secretary of Homeland Security?

757
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:52,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He's at the White House. - Who's the deputy sec?

758
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:55,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wyck Halsey. He's also at the White House.

759
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,Jesus.

760
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:00,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...happens,our thoughts go to terrorism.

761
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've had enough of this.

762
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Walker told us to stay where we are.

763
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:08,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Madam Secretary,gentlemen...

764
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:11,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...I'm gonna ask you to accompany us to the Blue Room.

765
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:13,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Who is this man? - He is...

766
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He's a concerned citizen. - Good morning,Mr. Secretary.

767
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:25,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You killed the secretary of defence. - Well,he wasn't doing a very good job.

768
00:47:25,590 --> 00:47:27,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay,so,would the remaining secretaries...

769
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...please join us in the Blue Room?

770
00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:35,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Sir,I'm on with Agent Reid. - How they doing?

771
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:37,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}VP just puked all over Air Force One.

772
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:40,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm General Caulfield,vice chairman,Joint Chiefs of Staff.

773
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have the nuclear launch codes been switched?

774
00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:45,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yes,and new codes are active. - The stock market's collapsing.

775
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:49,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Travis,I need you to suspend trading immediately.

776
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And there's gonna be a run on the banks,so close them now.

777
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You guys good? - Yes,sir.

778
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:04,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't mess it up.

779
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:08,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Son of a...

780
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:10,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Captain,where are we?

781
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:13,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have reason to believe that the explosive was a diversion.

782
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:15,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Diversion from what?

783
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:17,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}An armed team has taken over the White House.

784
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:18,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do we have the president?

785
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:20,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I spoke to Walker. He had eyes on Eagle.

786
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:22,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fifteen minutes is a lifetime.

787
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:26,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Radio chatter indicated they were headed for the PEOC. No contact.

788
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have to assume they've been compromised.

789
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:30,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We gotta get you to a phone.

790
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Call SEAL Team Six and they come in here...

791
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:35,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and they'll shoot these assholes in the head.

792
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:38,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We keep a satphone in the residence. - Great. Where's that at?

793
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:42,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course it is.

794
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:44,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You ever been rock climbing? - We climbing this?

795
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Unless you got a better idea,yeah.

796
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:49,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,I don't.

797
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}By the way,John Cale.

798
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- James Sawyer. - I'll get you out of here,sir.

799
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:57,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just follow me up.

800
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:01,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah,I'm right behind you.

801
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:03,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Make sure you have one handhold...

802
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:07,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- ...before you let go of the other one. - Whatever you do,I'll do.

803
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:13,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I ain't doing that shit.

804
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:20,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The scene here at the White House is getting more chaotic every second.

805
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:21,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have got hundreds...

806
00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:24,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As you can see,the military's moving into position...

807
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but won't advance because of safety concerns for the hostages.

808
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:31,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...obvious to everyone,this is the work of al Qaeda...

809
00:49:31,470 --> 00:49:34,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...or some like-minded Arab terrorist group.

810
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:36,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- The National Guard... - The building's buttoned up.

811
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:38,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rooftop's secure.

812
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:41,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- They attempted contact yet? - Not yet.

813
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:43,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Apparently,we're all Arabs. - Good.

814
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:45,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Cake? - No,I don't want cake.

815
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:47,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm diabetic.

816
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:54,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hallelujah.

817
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is my Graceland!

818
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:09,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sweet Shiva.

819
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:12,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sugary pops of delight.

820
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:22,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on,let's go! Move!

821
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:26,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go,sheeple. Now,welcome to my house.

822
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now,sit down and shut up!

823
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:30,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,baby,I've missed you.

824
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:36,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's get you plugged in. You fit in nicely right there.

825
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:40,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ladies and gentlemen,Skip Tyler has arrived.

826
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:44,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}By the time you're watching this,I will have pulled off the greatest hack...

827
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:47,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...the world has ever seen. This is difficult for some,it is...

828
00:50:47,830 --> 00:50:52,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but for me,it's as easy as one,two,three...

00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:56,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...four,five,six,seven,eight,nine.

830

00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:31,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Look who was hiding in the Press Room. - Oh,my God,Roger Skinner!

835
00:51:31,330 --> 00:51:35,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The only one who speaks the truth. I love your show. Seriously.

836
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:38,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After you,please. Get in there.

837
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:10,170

838
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:15,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Playing some hide-and-seek,little girl?

839
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:20,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,then,I will huff,and I will puff...

840
00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:23,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and I'm gonna blow your house down.

841
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:36,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No,no,no! Leave me alone. - Get in here.

842
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:38,820

845
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:49,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh,my God,where's my dad? - He went looking for you.

846
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me for a second.

847
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:04,260

848
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:05,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi.

00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:09,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I understand that this is a very high-stress time...

850
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:13,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but if you and your colleagues...

851
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...could maybe be a little more careful...

852
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:19,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...with the priceless artefacts that are in this building...

00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:23,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...because I mean,it is a living history... Okay,because see...

00:53:23,530 --> 00:53:25,780

855
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:29,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...that was a gift from Queen Elizabeth II. It's irreplaceable.

856
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll go sit down. I'm gonna... I'll be over here if you have any more questions.

00:55:08,050 --> 00:55:10,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...plus Secret Service feels it should be their show.

876
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It should. Carol Finnerty,Secret Service.

877
00:55:13,850 --> 00:55:16,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Vice President,it was our building that was taken.

878
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:19,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes,it was,and now you're standing in our building.

879
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:22,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We need to send the Army in there and take the White House back.

880
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:26,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think you can. Posse Comitatus and the Insurrection Act...

881
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:29,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...make it very difficult to deploy combat troops on American soil.

882
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:32,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Which is why we federalized the National Guard minutes ago.

883
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:35,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sir,with respect,only the president can do that.

884

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alvin,we're in a constitutional crisis here.

885
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've never had a missing chief executive.

886
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:43,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're gonna have to start talking about the 25th Amendment.

887
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:45,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wanna remove the president from power?

888
00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:48,420

00:55:48,590 --> 00:55:51,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and watch the government come crashing down around us.

890
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:53,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've tried them on the phone by now,right?

00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:37,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's me,Carol. You should've called already.

901
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:40,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Martin. - We've held the building for 15 minutes.

902
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:42,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- "We"? - I'm sure you're recording this...

903
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:46,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...so let's make this easy on everybody. My name is Martin James Walker.

904

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chief of the presidential detail of the Secret Service.

905
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:52,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My men currently control the White House and the 61 hostages within.

906
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:54,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What are you doing? - I did you the courtesy...

907
00:56:55,070 --> 00:56:58,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...of sending you out of here,so let's just keep it professional,okay?

908
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:00,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Professional"?

00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:03,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You killed your own men.

910
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:05,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's Ted?

911
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:07,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Killing Ted Hope...

912
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:11,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...was the second hardest thing I've ever had to do in my life.

913
00:57:15,510 --> 00:57:17,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Martin,I want you to...

914
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's not a thing you're about to say that I didn't teach you.

915
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:24,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So we're gonna get all this done in two hours and be done by lunch,okay?

916
00:57:24,730 --> 00:57:26,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now,ask me what I want.

917
00:57:28,190 --> 00:57:30,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What do you want? - On any given day...

918
00:57:30,490 --> 00:57:35,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...the United States Federal Reserve holds in excess of $400 million in cash.

919
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:38,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I want it loaded aboard a Boeing C-17...

920
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:42,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...which you will leave fuelled and otherwise empty on runway one-niner.

921
00:57:42,870 --> 00:57:46,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd like to know how you plan on getting from the White House...

922
00:57:46,210 --> 00:57:48,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...to Reagan National without being killed.

923
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:51,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have eyes in the sky. If I see a single sniper...

924
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:55,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...within 10 miles of this place,I am going to kill...

925
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...four Cabinet members...

926
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:59,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and in a particularly nice touch of irony...

927
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:02,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...the director of Homeland Security himself.

928
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:04,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is President Sawyer alive?

929
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:10,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yes. - I want proof of life.

930
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:13,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got two hours or I will execute him myself...

931
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:16,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...on the South Lawn of the White House.

932
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:20,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jesus,the head of his own detail.

933
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:22,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At least we know how they got in so easily.

934
00:58:22,910 --> 00:58:25,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can we be sure he's the only Secret Service member...

935
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:28,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- ...who's been compromised? - Oh,go to hell.

936
00:58:28,330 --> 00:58:29,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Proof of life,huh?

937
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:32,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You say you can do better than your men. Here's your chance.

938
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:34,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Find him. - With pleasure.

939
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Walker's wife,Muriel,is in Fairfax.

940
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:40,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Could you find her,please?

941
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:43,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You okay?

942
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:46,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have Thanksgiving at their house every year.

943
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:49,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wanna run the whole search again,from the top.

944
00:58:49,270 --> 00:58:52,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Motts,meet me on the ground floor. Chen,Vadim,the third.

945
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:53,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Meet in the middle.

946
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:56,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Roger that. I'm taking the stairs. Mulcahy,finish up.

947
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:57,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was the last one.

948
00:58:57,990 --> 00:58:59,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait,so you said Walker's son died?

949
00:58:59,950 --> 00:59:03,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Pentagon thought that Iran had a nuclear bomb. We sent a team in.

950
00:59:03,950 --> 00:59:06,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Things went wrong. Martin's son Kevin got killed.

951
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:09,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You're telling me this is personal? - He's not doing it by himself.

952
00:59:09,670 --> 00:59:11,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Someone else is footing the bill. - Who?

953
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:13,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Heard of the military-industrial complex?

954
00:59:13,710 --> 00:59:15,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Those are the manufacturers of the weapons.

955
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:20,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They think they own the system and they will do anything to keep that power.

956
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They profit off of your sacrifice.

957
00:59:22,390 --> 00:59:24,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Politicians always love talking about sacrifice.

958
00:59:24,970 --> 00:59:27,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Think I don't know anything about sacrifice?

959
00:59:27,390 --> 00:59:29,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How many people come to your house and wanna kill you?

960
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:32,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Missiles are topside.

961
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Elevator going down to one.

962
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:43,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We gotta get off on the second floor. - What?

963
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:44,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get off,get off,get off.

964
00:59:45,830 --> 00:59:48,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You all right? You see anybody? - No,we're clear.

965
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:50,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kick it in. Harder.

966
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:57,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. President,stay on my hip.

967
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:02,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got three rounds. Tell me you got some weapons in the residence.

968
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:05,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,we usually have two agents right there with machine guns.

969
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:07,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We got some knives in the kitchen. - What?

970
01:00:07,350 --> 01:00:08,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're big knives.

971
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:10,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great,then you can make me a sandwich.

972
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:12,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now,where's the phone?

973
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:20,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right here.

974
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:23,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Walker set this number up. Wait a minute,he's gonna trace it.

975
01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:26,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We gotta get in touch with somebody on the outside.

976
01:00:26,450 --> 01:00:28,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I got somebody. - You got somebody?

977
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah,yeah. - I need to get my shoes.

978
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:49,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Needed this.

979
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:58,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hello? - Jenna,this is John Cale.

980
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:00,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}John,not a good time.

981
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:02,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait,wait,hold on a second.

982
01:01:02,570 --> 01:01:05,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Close friend? - She works for the vice president.

983
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:09,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have you heard what's happening? It's not a good time.

984
01:01:09,830 --> 01:01:12,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm with the president. We're in the White House.

985
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:15,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That's not funny,John. - Does this sound like a joke to you?

986
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:18,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah,he's... - Jenna,this is James Sawyer.

987
01:01:18,590 --> 01:01:22,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For the past 10 minutes,I've been getting shot at with this young man.

988
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:25,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you could connect me to whatever control structure we still have left...

989
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:27,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- ...I would really appreciate it. - Hold on.

990
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:30,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello? Thank you.

991
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:33,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She hung up?

992
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:37,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She put me on hold when I was thanking her.

993
01:01:39,150 --> 01:01:43,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So we wait for your best friend Jenna to hit us back.

994
01:01:48,530 --> 01:01:50,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You smoke?

995
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:53,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Neither do I.

996
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:57,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is your moment,sir.

997
01:01:57,460 --> 01:02:00,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The country is looking for a leader. It's your time to step up.

998
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told you,we weren't to be disturbed.

999
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:05,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The president of the United States called my cell.

1000
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:07,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Mr. President. - It's about damn time.

1001
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:10,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Mr. President,are you all right? - We're safe.

1002
01:02:10,390 --> 01:02:12,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- "We"? - Yeah,I'm with someone.

1003
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:13,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna put him on the phone.

1004
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:15,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hello,this is John Cale. - Cale?

1005
01:02:15,810 --> 01:02:17,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing in the White House?

1006
01:02:17,770 --> 01:02:20,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He's doing a damn good job. - It's a long story,Mr. Speaker...

1007
01:02:20,860 --> 01:02:24,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but look,they've taken the building and they're holding hostages.

1008
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- This is when you come get us. - We're doing our best.

1009
01:02:26,950 --> 01:02:30,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Do we have any intel on these people? - We are working on that,sir.

1010
01:02:30,490 --> 01:02:32,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have to get the president out of there.

1011
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:35,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Can you get to the basement? - Yeah,sure.

1012
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:36,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah. - There's a series of tunnels.

1013
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:39,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}JFK used them to sneak Marilyn in.

1014
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:41,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I thought that was a myth. - It's true.

1015
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:42,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Donnie's gonna be pissed.

1016
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:45,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get to the basement. I'll lead you to the tunnels.

1017
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:48,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay,Carol,I got separated from Emily. Can you tell me if she made it out?

1018
01:02:49,050 --> 01:02:53,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're gonna find her,but you have got to get the president to safety,okay?

1019
01:03:01,730 --> 01:03:04,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cale? Cale? Can you get him back?

1020
01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:40,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Son of a bitch!

1021
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:58,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get your hands off my Jordans!

1022
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:10,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Freeze! I said freeze!

1023
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:12,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shoot him!

1024
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:13,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,don't shoot him.

1025
01:04:18,850 --> 01:04:20,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shoot him!

1026
01:04:26,190 --> 01:04:27,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit.

1027
01:04:34,950 --> 01:04:38,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Are you okay? - Yeah.

1028
01:04:38,580 --> 01:04:40,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry about him.

1029
01:04:40,370 --> 01:04:44,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He would've killed me if you wouldn't have killed him.

1030
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks,asshole.

1031
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look what I found. Merry Christmas.

1032
01:04:51,130 --> 01:04:53,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You got the satphone? - Right here.

1033
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:54,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And it's on.

1034
01:04:56,930 --> 01:05:00,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Mr. President,are you okay? - Define "okay."

1035
01:05:00,310 --> 01:05:01,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happened,John?

1036
01:05:01,890 --> 01:05:04,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got two dead bad guys,that's what happened.

1037
01:05:04,310 --> 01:05:07,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These guys had military training. You gotta find out what they're doing here.

1038
01:05:08,030 --> 01:05:09,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Walker demanded a ransom.

1039
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:11,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You think they're going through this for money? - Guys.

1040
01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:14,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You need to see this. - Hang on,John.

1041
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:16,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...people watching all of this together.

1042
01:05:16,490 --> 01:05:19,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No doubt young Emily Cale had to risk her own life to...

1043
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:23,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you get me the president here? Cale,can you turn on the news?

1044
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:25,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got a TV?

1045
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:28,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We need to find out how Walker found these guys.

1046
01:05:28,590 --> 01:05:31,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- John,you've gotta turn on the news. - What's going on?

1047
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:32,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm so sorry.

1048
01:05:32,630 --> 01:05:35,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What you are seeing really is just amazing footage...

1049
01:05:35,970 --> 01:05:40,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...captured by an extremely brave young girl by the name of Emily Cale.

1050
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:44,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now,these are the first images coming to us from inside the White House...

1051
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:47,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...from inside this hostage situation.

1052
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:52,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The images have gone viral. They've had more than a hundred million...

1053
01:05:52,530 --> 01:05:54,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait. Cale,Cale,listen.

1054
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:57,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're all walking out of here together,okay?

1055
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:58,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I gotta go get her.

1056
01:05:58,950 --> 01:06:00,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Captain. - Yes,sir?

1057
01:06:00,370 --> 01:06:03,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get me facial recognition on everyone in that video now.

1058
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:06,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...very brave young girl named Emily Cale.

1059
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The hostages include the nine girls...

1060
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:11,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...from Watkins Charter School in Louisville...

1061
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:13,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...five Cabinet members as well...

1062
01:06:14,050 --> 01:06:17,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and also,understandably,a very emotional Roger Skinner.

1063
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:19,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And from what I understand now...

1064
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:33,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got the president a scrambled satphone to call his family with.

1065
01:06:34,070 --> 01:06:37,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He keeps it in his bedside table in the residence. See if it's still there.

1066
01:06:40,030 --> 01:06:41,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. No.

1067
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:53,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Vadim,would you be kind enough to confirm your last name for me,please?

1068
01:06:55,050 --> 01:06:57,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Let's go. - They're in the residence.

1069
01:06:57,470 --> 01:06:59,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go! That's them in the residence.

1070
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:02,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Easy.

1071
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:11,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...And the faces of the terrorists.

1072
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:13,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You gotta be shitting me.

1073
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:16,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So we are going to put those faces up on-screen right now...

1074
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:18,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In here!

1075
01:07:18,450 --> 01:07:21,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As we put these faces up on-screen,we are sure that we will...

1076
01:07:21,530 --> 01:07:24,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...no doubt learn the names of the men who are...

1077
01:07:24,370 --> 01:07:26,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...holding the White House hostage.

1078
01:07:26,870 --> 01:07:30,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These men are clearly not al Qaeda.

1079
01:07:30,290 --> 01:07:33,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are positive that the FBI will have...

1080
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:36,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...those images out. So again,these are images...

1081
01:07:37,130 --> 01:07:38,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...captured by a brave young girl...

1082
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:41,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How many more ways can you guys screw this thing up?

1083
01:07:44,890 --> 01:07:46,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey.

1084
01:07:46,930 --> 01:07:50,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How you like your chair? You comfortable,Mr. Skinner?

1085
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:52,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me ask you a question.

1086
01:07:52,770 --> 01:07:55,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where do you come up with all the ideas for your show?

1087
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I... - You got guys who do that for you?

1088
01:07:59,820 --> 01:08:03,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because,believe me,I got some good ideas.

1089
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:19,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey!

1090
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:25,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give it to me.

1091
01:08:37,190 --> 01:08:40,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Congratulations,asshole,you just made us all famous.

1092
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:46,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When they come for us,you're gonna die first.

1093
01:08:48,410 --> 01:08:49,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get away from me.

1094
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:53,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You understand? - Get away from me.

1095
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:11,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sir,we have facial recognition coming up right now.

1096
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:15,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Carl Killick. This guy's a right-wing sociopath.

1097
01:09:15,230 --> 01:09:18,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}First arrested at age 12. Tried to blow up his local post office...

1098
01:09:18,730 --> 01:09:21,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...because they employed too many African-Americans.

1099
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:22,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Last seen with Conrad Cern.

1100
01:09:23,070 --> 01:09:24,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I saw that guy at the Capitol.

1101
01:09:24,740 --> 01:09:27,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He runs a white-power hate blog against President Sawyer.

1102
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:30,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Lovely. - Jesus. Skip Tyler.

1103
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:32,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}King of the hackers. Worked for the NSA.

1104
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Was fired for rewriting nuclear launch coordinates...

1105
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:37,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...to target Apple headquarters.

1106
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:40,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was unhappy with their music-sharing polices.

1107
01:09:40,420 --> 01:09:42,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Walker's been after this guy forever.

1108
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:45,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And Emil Stenz. Ex-Delta Force.

1109
01:09:45,590 --> 01:09:46,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Highly decorated.

1110
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:48,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm afraid we know this guy too.

1111
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:50,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- How? - Unfortunately,that's classified.

1112
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:54,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,I hereby declassify it. Now,you wanna share it with the group?

1113
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:57,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stenz did off-the-books wetwork for us in Pakistan...

1114
01:09:57,270 --> 01:09:59,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}was part of a black-bag CIA operation.

1115
01:09:59,270 --> 01:10:02,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When the Sawyer administration came in,the new secretary of defence...

1116
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...shut down the operation and disavowed its assets...

1117
01:10:05,030 --> 01:10:07,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...including Stenz. His identity was compromised.

1118
01:10:07,530 --> 01:10:10,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He wound up spending two years in a Taliban-controlled prison.

1119
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:13,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No wonder he's pissed at us. - It's the threat matrix.

1120
01:10:13,290 --> 01:10:15,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Every day the Secret Service does a rundown...

1121
01:10:15,580 --> 01:10:18,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...of threats against the president. Every one of these guys was on it.

1122
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's like Walker used it as a shopping list.

1123
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:23,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sir,Delta Force is 15 minutes out.

1124
01:10:23,470 --> 01:10:27,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right,general. I want them prepped for an attack on the White House...

1125
01:10:27,470 --> 01:10:29,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- ...as soon as I give the word. - Sir,please! Please.

1126
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:31,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Only the president can give that order.

1127
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:34,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The president is behind enemy lines and compromised.

1128
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:38,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm calling the Cabinet together to invoke the 25th.

1129
01:10:38,690 --> 01:10:40,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gel' behind this,Eli.

1130
01:10:41,110 --> 01:10:43,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What if this were even a coup d'etat?

1131
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:44,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on,that's just nonsense.

1132
01:10:44,860 --> 01:10:47,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why isn't the military doing anything?

1133
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:49,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You gotta understand,this is a very difficult situation...

1134
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:53,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...for the Pentagon,there are hostages. You can't bring the big guns out...

1135
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:57,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...because there's a class of little schoolgirls still inside.

1136
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:14,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Martin! - Good morning,boys.

1137
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:16,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Move,move!

1138
01:11:18,350 --> 01:11:19,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on,go,go,go!

1139
01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:23,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- They're in the ground-floor kitchen. - That's it.

1140
01:11:23,860 --> 01:11:25,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on,go,go,go! Where's the basement?

1141
01:11:25,940 --> 01:11:27,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Through here. To the left.

1142
01:11:46,970 --> 01:11:48,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Shit! - They're gone.

1143
01:11:48,510 --> 01:11:50,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Goddamn it!

1144
01:11:51,350 --> 01:11:54,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I have the president and Cale calling. - Cale,give me your location.

1145
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:58,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right,we're in the basement. There's a gate with a keypad.

1146
01:11:59,060 --> 01:12:01,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay,the code is 64762.

1147
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:05,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right,we're in.

1148
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:08,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go down the hallway. That should be the entrance to the catacombs.

1149
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:10,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Are you sure? - Yes,I'm sure.

1150
01:12:11,370 --> 01:12:15,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should then be in a big oval room. There'll be five tunnels.

1151
01:12:15,790 --> 01:12:18,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take the second tunnel,follow it all the way out...

1152
01:12:18,370 --> 01:12:21,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- ...and we'll be waiting. - We found it. Mr. President...

1153
01:12:21,210 --> 01:12:22,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...take this.

1154
01:12:22,540 --> 01:12:24,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I can't go. - What are you talking about?

1155
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:26,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm not leaving my little girl. - Then I'm staying.

1156
01:12:27,090 --> 01:12:29,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You gotta go back to being president,sir.

1157
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:32,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Otherwise,all this is for nothing. - You can't do this by yourself.

1158
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:37,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're gonna go and send the Marines in here to get us,okay? Promise me.

1159
01:12:37,430 --> 01:12:38,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right.

1160
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:42,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got my word. Thanks,John.

1161
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:43,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right.

1162
01:12:49,530 --> 01:12:50,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See you outside.

1163
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:07,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They are in the basement.

1164
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:10,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right,everyone in the basement! The basement!

1165
01:13:12,970 --> 01:13:14,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cale,come check this out.

1166
01:13:15,970 --> 01:13:17,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay,please don't touch my toys.

1167
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:22,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's something that we do not wanna touch.

1168
01:13:22,310 --> 01:13:23,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Carol,we got a problem.

1169
01:13:23,650 --> 01:13:26,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The exit tunnel's wired with explosives. We need another exit.

1170
01:13:26,730 --> 01:13:28,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There isn't another exit.

1171
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:30,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's locked!

1172
01:13:30,820 --> 01:13:33,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Tyler,I need the gate code. - I have that right here.

1173
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:35,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here's your gate code.

1174
01:13:35,660 --> 01:13:37,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is not happening. We gotta move.

1175
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:39,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Carol,where are we going? - Hold on.

1176
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:41,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't hold on.

1177
01:13:44,250 --> 01:13:45,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We need a location right now!

1178
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:49,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stagecoach. Follow me. Let's get to the Stagecoach.

1179
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:51,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,no,no,you'll be trapped.

1180
01:13:52,930 --> 01:13:55,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is a bad idea. They grounded all aircraft.

1181
01:13:56,010 --> 01:13:59,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is Jack Freeman reporting live from the skies over Washington,D.C.

1182
01:13:59,470 --> 01:14:03,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're bringing you exclusive images of the terrorist-held White House.

1183
01:14:03,770 --> 01:14:05,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Clear left.

1184
01:14:09,730 --> 01:14:12,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cabinet is assembling with the vice president to invoke the 25th.

1185
01:14:12,950 --> 01:14:15,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cale,if you don't get him out in the next five minutes...

1186
01:14:15,780 --> 01:14:19,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- ...he might not be president anymore. - You didn't give me the job,remember?

1187
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:22,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's the code to D227?

1188
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:24,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's the code for D227?

1189
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:26,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold on.

1190
01:14:26,460 --> 01:14:28,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fast! Go,go,go! Go,go!

1191
01:14:31,340 --> 01:14:32,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}13350.

1192
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:38,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're in,let's go!

1193
01:14:38,350 --> 01:14:40,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Go,I'll cover you! - All right,all right!

1194
01:14:42,980 --> 01:14:46,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This way,Cale. The keys.

1195
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:54,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Got them!

1196
01:14:55,740 --> 01:14:58,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell are you getting in the back for?

1197
01:14:58,570 --> 01:14:59,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry,force of habit.

1198
01:15:12,130 --> 01:15:14,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Damn it! Keys! Let's go! Let's go!

1199
01:15:19,090 --> 01:15:20,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm crashing the gate. - No,no,no!

1200
01:15:20,890 --> 01:15:24,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's 8 feet tall and dual-hardened steel. We're not gonna make it. Left!

1201
01:15:26,940 --> 01:15:30,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Where's the garage clicker? - You kidding? I don't have a clicker.

1202
01:15:30,230 --> 01:15:31,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Suburban!

1203
01:15:32,690 --> 01:15:36,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think I'm seeing the presidential limo driving across the grounds.

1204
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:41,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're gonna out them off! Hang on,Motts!

1205
01:15:41,410 --> 01:15:43,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Watch out,watch out,watch out!

1206
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:45,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cale,they're in heavy weapons follow-up.

1207
01:15:46,290 --> 01:15:47,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you mean,"heavy weapon"?

1208
01:15:49,580 --> 01:15:51,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You gotta be kidding me right now!

1209
01:15:53,670 --> 01:15:54,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Move!

1210
01:15:58,430 --> 01:16:00,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,my goodness! The presidential limo...

1211
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:03,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...has just burst onto the South Lawn!

1212
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:07,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- So sorry. - Ladies and gentlemen of the Cabinet...

1213
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:10,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- ...it's with a heavy heart... - Sir,you have to see this!

1214
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:14,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's trying to make its way around the South Lawn fountain.

1215
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:16,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That iconic fountain that everybody knows...

1216
01:16:16,940 --> 01:16:19,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...anyone who's ever been to the White House knows.

1217
01:16:19,650 --> 01:16:21,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Box them in! Go for the window,Motts!

1218
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:28,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tanks. We got tanks. Let's put them to use.

1219
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:31,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think that's my dad.

1220
01:16:31,330 --> 01:16:33,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not sure using heavy artillery is a wise...

1221
01:16:33,750 --> 01:16:35,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't give a damn. You get that tank...

1222
01:16:36,090 --> 01:16:38,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- ...you put a hole in the goddamn fence! - Yeah! Come on!

1223
01:16:39,470 --> 01:16:41,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look,look,look! Watch him,watch him,watch him.

1224
01:16:41,890 --> 01:16:43,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go for the windshield! Go!

1225
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:51,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Watch out,watch out,watch out. - Get your head down.

1226
01:17:05,780 --> 01:17:07,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah,that's one down. - Shit!

1227
01:17:07,870 --> 01:17:09,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Commander,are you in position? - Roger.

1228
01:17:09,870 --> 01:17:12,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Then go to work. - Fall back! Fall back!

1229
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:15,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Driver,advance!

1230
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:19,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't know what is happening exactly,but the National Guard is in fact...

1231
01:17:19,170 --> 01:17:21,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...enacting some sort of manoeuvre. It depends...

1232
01:17:23,590 --> 01:17:25,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}RPG'S! Now!

1233
01:17:27,970 --> 01:17:30,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Blow these bastards off the roof.

1234
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:35,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Take cover! - Fire!

1235
01:17:45,530 --> 01:17:46,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Incoming!

1236
01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:53,750

1237
01:17:58,550 --> 01:18:00,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Goddamn it! - Shit.

1238
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:03,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good job,boys! Great job,Mulcahy!

1239
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:07,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is an unprecedented situation. We have a full-scale war going on...

1240
01:18:07,930 --> 01:18:09,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...on the White House grounds.

1241
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:12,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mulcahy! Take out the limo! Let's go! Take the limo!

1242
01:18:13,890 --> 01:18:15,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you waiting on? Take it out!

1243
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:18,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're firing.

1244
01:18:19,770 --> 01:18:22,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I can't see. What am I supposed to do? - I need him alive!

1245
01:18:22,780 --> 01:18:24,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That's an order! - Why don't you shut up?

1246
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:26,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a camera system here in the car. There.

1247
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:30,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What am I doing with zombies? - It's my daughter's favourite movie.

1248
01:18:30,450 --> 01:18:32,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Watch out,watch out! Left!

1249
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:37,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We gotta punch a hole in this fence soon or we're dead in the water.

1250
01:18:37,790 --> 01:18:40,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a weapons locker in the back.

1251
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Jackpot! - What you got?

1252
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:44,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what I'm talking about!

1253
01:18:45,130 --> 01:18:47,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That thing in your right hand is a blast shield. Perfect.

1254
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:52,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you not hit me in the head with a rocket while I'm trying to drive?!

1255
01:18:52,810 --> 01:18:54,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get me to the fence,Cale!

1256
01:18:55,390 --> 01:18:59,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Stick that thing out there,go to work. - Damn right.

1257
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:01,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold it with two hands,Mr. President.

1258
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:03,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,my God,that's President Sawyer.

1259
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:07,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He has a rocket launcher. - There's something you don't see every day.

1260
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:09,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here it comes!

1261
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:18,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I lost the rocket launcher. - How do you lose a rocket launcher?

1262
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Killick,take one of the hostages outside. Show them we mean business.

1263
01:19:24,130 --> 01:19:25,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This just in from China.

1264
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:27,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}destroyed the West Gate of the White House.

1265
01:19:29,510 --> 01:19:32,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We got our exit. - One more time around the fountain.

1266
01:19:32,510 --> 01:19:33,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No! - Get over here.

1267
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:36,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One of the terrorists is holding a little girl at gunpoint.

1268
01:19:36,890 --> 01:19:39,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What'd he say? - Emily Cale is being held...

1269
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:42,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...at the White House balcony right now by the terrorists.

1270
01:19:42,940 --> 01:19:47,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She was the one who managed to send this video out so the world could see...

1271
01:19:47,780 --> 01:19:49,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Another rocket. - Cale!

1272
01:19:51,740 --> 01:19:52,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad!

1273
01:19:58,830 --> 01:20:00,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't see what is going on...

1274
01:20:00,630 --> 01:20:02,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get me a location on them now!

1275
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:04,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...The West Wing. The president has...

01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:07,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're not sure if he's alive or dead right now.

1277
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:09,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- The limousine has disappeared... - Emily?

1278
01:20:09,550 --> 01:20:11,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...The West Wing. I can't see him...

1279
01:20:11,430 --> 01:20:13,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Killick,take her back inside.

1280
01:20:13,220 --> 01:20:16,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Dad! - Get over here!

1281
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:21,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit. What the...?

1282
01:20:29,650 --> 01:20:32,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Something wrong with your radio? - Malfunctioned.

1283
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:35,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stay behind me. They won't shoot us. They need me alive.

1284
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:36,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Put a gun to my head. - What?

1285
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:39,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That concludes the running-and-shooting portion.

1286
01:20:39,410 --> 01:20:41,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stay back or I'll shoot him!

1287
01:20:41,290 --> 01:20:45,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Appreciate what you're trying to do,son. Did the same job myself,and proudly.

1288
01:20:45,170 --> 01:20:48,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have no quarrel with you,but I do have a deadline.

01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:49,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So put the gun down...

1290
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:50,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pull the pin.

1291
01:20:51,090 --> 01:20:53,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...because you're not gonna shoot the president.

1292
01:20:53,550 --> 01:20:55,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You're right. - Where does that leave us,boys?

1293
01:20:56,100 --> 01:20:58,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That leaves us with this.

1294
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:01,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on!

1295
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:02,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go,go,go!

1296
01:21:10,030 --> 01:21:11,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing?!

1297
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:17,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,no. Come on,go!

1298
01:21:17,370 --> 01:21:19,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This way! Follow me! Follow me!

1299
01:21:25,250 --> 01:21:28,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Enormous explosion over toward the West Wing.

1300
01:21:28,460 --> 01:21:31,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know if this means the president has been killed. We know...

1301
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:34,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got 100 people in here! Somebody tell me something!

1302
01:21:37,970 --> 01:21:39,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You idiot. - What'd you say?

1303
01:21:40,060 --> 01:21:42,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are an idiot.

1304
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:44,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You just blew our whole mission.

1305
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:45,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Your mission. - Shut up.

1306
01:22:02,580 --> 01:22:06,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Stenz,this may be your lucky day. Get your men back to the basement.

1307
01:22:08,630 --> 01:22:12,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I,Alvin Hammond,do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute...

1308
01:22:12,340 --> 01:22:14,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...the office of president of the United States...

1309
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:18,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and will to the best of my ability preserve,protect and defend...

1310
01:22:18,970 --> 01:22:22,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...the Constitution of the United States,so help me God.

1311
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:25,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sir,follow me,please.

1312
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:37,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Place your hand there for scanning,please.

1313
01:22:40,580 --> 01:22:43,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sir,these are your presidential launch codes.

1314
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:45,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keep them on your person at all times.

1315
01:22:45,250 --> 01:22:48,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Vice President Alvin Hammond has just been sworn in...

1316
01:22:48,460 --> 01:22:51,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...as the 47th president of the United States...

1317
01:22:51,460 --> 01:22:54,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...confirming,of course,the worst possible scenario...

1318
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:57,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...the death of President James Sawyer.

1319
01:22:57,890 --> 01:23:00,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}People all over the globe have been holding their breath.

1320
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:04,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're wondering what is happening right here in America.

1321
01:23:04,390 --> 01:23:07,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After all,the United States has the biggest weapons arsenal in the world.

1322
01:23:08,020 --> 01:23:11,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We need to start moving the money. Maybe buy some time.

1323
01:23:11,940 --> 01:23:16,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will he be able to get this extremely volatile situation under control.

1324
01:23:16,780 --> 01:23:18,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Muriel Walker's here.

1325
01:23:18,490 --> 01:23:21,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thousands are gathering,leaving candles and flowers...

1326
01:23:21,620 --> 01:23:23,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...at the doors of the U.S...

1327
01:23:23,910 --> 01:23:25,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've got movement.

1328
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:29,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've got movement at the Federal Reserve.

1329
01:23:29,460 --> 01:23:32,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stenz,do you hear me? Confirming they're loading the money.

1330
01:23:32,420 --> 01:23:34,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's wrap this up.

1331
01:23:35,050 --> 01:23:37,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stenz,we're wasting our time here.

1332
01:23:37,430 --> 01:23:39,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Walker,are you sure they're down here?

1333
01:23:40,090 --> 01:23:43,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did I spend 15 goddamn years running this place or did you?!

1334
01:23:44,140 --> 01:23:45,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This guy is losing it.

1335
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:48,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do we care if he gets the president?

1336
01:23:48,650 --> 01:23:49,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We made a deal.

1337
01:23:52,690 --> 01:23:54,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cale was right. This is not about ransom.

1338
01:23:54,780 --> 01:23:56,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Walker has cancer.

1339
01:23:56,530 --> 01:23:58,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His doctors gave him less than three months.

1340
01:23:58,740 --> 01:24:01,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He has a golf-ball-sized tumour on his frontal lobe.

1341
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:02,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jesus Christ.

1342
01:24:03,030 --> 01:24:05,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think he's on a suicide mission.

1343
01:24:06,910 --> 01:24:08,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You ready? - Yes.

1344
01:24:08,330 --> 01:24:11,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What do you think you're doing? - If anybody can talk him down...

1345
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:12,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...it's her,trust me.

1346
01:24:15,460 --> 01:24:18,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A little birdie told me you're finally moving the money.

1347
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:20,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Martin?

1348
01:24:26,350 --> 01:24:29,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I had to tell them about the tumour,Martin.

1349
01:24:32,690 --> 01:24:33,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's all right.

1350
01:24:35,530 --> 01:24:37,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please stop this.

1351
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:40,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please just come home.

1352
01:24:43,950 --> 01:24:45,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have to do this,honey.

1353
01:24:46,660 --> 01:24:47,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,you don't.

1354
01:24:48,450 --> 01:24:51,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They have to pay for what they did to Kevin.

1355
01:24:51,830 --> 01:24:53,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And when it's over...

1356
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...I promise...

1357
01:24:58,260 --> 01:24:59,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I promise you'll understand.

1358
01:25:08,980 --> 01:25:10,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're doing this for Kevin?

1359
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:13,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I swear to God.

1360
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:21,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then you do whatever it takes.

1361
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:25,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You make them pay for what they did to our boy.

1362
01:25:25,530 --> 01:25:27,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell are you doing?

1363
01:25:28,450 --> 01:25:30,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Walker,you stop this...

1364
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:33,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...or I'll make sure she spends the rest of her life in a federal prison.

1365
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have 19 minutes.

1366
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:41,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're done.

1367
01:25:41,510 --> 01:25:43,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- General. - Your boss took the White House...

1368
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:45,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and your man inside got the president killed.

1369
01:25:46,100 --> 01:25:48,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Carol,calm down. - You're free to go.

1370
01:25:52,230 --> 01:25:54,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank God for Gerald Ford.

1371
01:25:54,690 --> 01:25:55,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why?

1372
01:25:55,940 --> 01:25:59,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He built this because he didn't want the press to see him in his swim trunks.

1373
01:25:59,730 --> 01:26:03,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Any chance this leads out of here? - No. Listen,I gotta stop for a second.

1374
01:26:03,530 --> 01:26:05,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? You all right?

1375
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:07,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not good,is it?

1376
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:10,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Stenz worked for the CIA,right? - Right.

1377
01:26:10,910 --> 01:26:13,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If we can track the way that Walker contacted...

1378
01:26:13,460 --> 01:26:15,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...these guys,we can figure out how to stop them.

1379
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:18,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- How do you propose we do that? - Keep an eye on Caulfield.

1380
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:21,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait,what?

1381
01:26:23,220 --> 01:26:25,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi. I'm Carol.

1382
01:26:26,680 --> 01:26:28,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not supposed to talk to you right now.

1383
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:31,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Run a database search on the guys in that building.

1384
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:34,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}CIA,NSA,everything you've got.

1385
01:26:37,270 --> 01:26:40,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay,listen,Walker's not doing this for the money,trust me.

1386
01:26:40,650 --> 01:26:43,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- There is something else going on. - I can't do that,ma'am.

1387
01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:46,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}On the worst day that our country has ever had...

1388
01:26:46,950 --> 01:26:49,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...you could be the key to figuring all of this out.

1389
01:26:52,410 --> 01:26:55,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...could otherwise not accomplish that is take back the White House.

1390
01:26:59,540 --> 01:27:01,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna have to get that out.

1391
01:27:01,170 --> 01:27:03,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When did you become a doctor all of a sudden?

1392
01:27:03,420 --> 01:27:06,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look,just talk to me,get my mind off it. Talk to me about your daughter.

1393
01:27:07,010 --> 01:27:09,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Emily? She's completely in love with you.

1394
01:27:09,430 --> 01:27:13,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- She even tried to get me to vote for you. - You didn't vote for me?

1395
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:17,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your daughter's smart. You should listen to her.

1396
01:27:17,980 --> 01:27:20,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She was like 3 when I enlisted.

1397
01:27:20,940 --> 01:27:22,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And to be honest with you...

1398
01:27:22,980 --> 01:27:25,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...I was probably just running from my marriage.

1399
01:27:25,820 --> 01:27:28,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right after I deployed,Emily was watching TV...

1400
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:31,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and there was coverage on the troops in Afghanistan.

1401
01:27:31,330 --> 01:27:34,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She swears to me that she saw me.

1402
01:27:34,660 --> 01:27:37,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After that point,she became obsessed with politics.

1403
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:40,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that's when she first saw you.

1404
01:27:40,630 --> 01:27:43,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The man that was gonna bring Daddy home.

1405
01:27:43,170 --> 01:27:47,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And when I finally did come home,I realised that...

1406
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:51,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...I'm not her hero anymore.

1407
01:27:51,930 --> 01:27:56,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I guess I just figured that I'd try to help protect the man that is.

1408
01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:00,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,if she saw you today,Cale,she'd be proud of you.

1409
01:28:00,310 --> 01:28:03,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know how when they're young and they come running up to you...

1410
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:05,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and they hug you and they're shouting "Daddy"...

1411
01:28:06,030 --> 01:28:10,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and all of a sudden,one day,that just stops?

1412
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:11,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

1413
01:28:11,490 --> 01:28:13,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd give anything for that hug just one more time.

1414
01:28:14,540 --> 01:28:17,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know,my daughter,she's 15 years old,her name is Amber.

1415
01:28:17,620 --> 01:28:20,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what she wants for her birthday?

1416
01:28:20,670 --> 01:28:23,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- A belly button ring. - Belly button ring.

1417
01:28:23,710 --> 01:28:26,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What parent is equipped for that? - Daughters.

1418
01:28:30,220 --> 01:28:33,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What's happening? - Attention,attention.

1419
01:28:33,510 --> 01:28:38,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everyone below Calico T-11,please clear the floor immediately.

1420
01:28:38,390 --> 01:28:40,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Put the president on-screen.

1421
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:44,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. President,Delta Force entered Washington airspace.

1422
01:28:44,270 --> 01:28:46,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have Lieutenant Colonel Cameron on the line.

1423
01:28:48,610 --> 01:28:50,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're online,sir!

1424
01:28:51,530 --> 01:28:53,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you have for us,colonel?

1425
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:56,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We developed this plan independent of the Secret Service.

1426
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:58,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll use the superstructure of the city to mask our approach.

1427
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:01,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What if they start killing hostages?

1428
01:29:01,210 --> 01:29:02,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're dead anyway if this fails.

1429
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Alvin,please think about what you're doing. - Mr. speaker

1430
01:29:05,170 --> 01:29:08,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}May I remind you that you are addressing the president of the United States?

1431
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:11,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. President,I don't wanna write off any Americans yet.

1432
01:29:12,050 --> 01:29:14,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Trust me,sir,we'll get your house back for you.

1433
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:16,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Mission's a go,colonel. - Thank you,sir.

1434
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:23,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You heard the president. Flight time to target: six minutes.

1435
01:29:23,770 --> 01:29:26,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- So,what's it like being president? - It's not like anything.

1436
01:29:26,820 --> 01:29:29,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Once you get into office,it's all about re-election...

1437
01:29:29,940 --> 01:29:32,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and what the other side can use against you.

1438
01:29:32,240 --> 01:29:35,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Politics. - You don't start out a politician...

1439
01:29:35,700 --> 01:29:36,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but you become one.

1440
01:29:36,950 --> 01:29:39,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just once,though,I wanna do something that's presidential.

1441
01:29:39,950 --> 01:29:43,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something along the lines of Lincoln,Washington and Jefferson.

1442
01:29:43,170 --> 01:29:46,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You wanna make history. - No. Not history.

1443
01:29:46,460 --> 01:29:48,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wanna make a difference.

1444
01:29:48,170 --> 01:29:50,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If your little daughter says that I'm her hero...

1445
01:29:51,090 --> 01:29:52,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...then I gotta earn that.

1446
01:29:59,140 --> 01:30:03,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right,we go in low and quiet. Time to target is two minutes.

1447
01:30:10,570 --> 01:30:15,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Falcon 2,maintain 3-0 feet. - Falcon 1,copy,3-0 feet.

1448
01:30:35,130 --> 01:30:38,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Drop to 1-0 feet! - Falcon 2 dropping to 10 feet.

1449
01:30:41,310 --> 01:30:45,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Complete chaos on the streets of D.C. There's total gridlock through...

1450
01:30:45,350 --> 01:30:48,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,my God! U.S. Special Forces are flying over us!

1451
01:30:59,700 --> 01:31:02,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit. Sir,we have Black Hawks coming in.

1452
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:05,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Which direction? - From I Street,and fast.

1453
01:31:08,210 --> 01:31:11,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- How do you feel,Mr. President? - Surprisingly good,Dr. Cale.

1454
01:31:13,380 --> 01:31:17,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me call in,make sure they don't think we're dead.

1455
01:31:17,470 --> 01:31:19,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The former vice president,Alvin Hammond...

1456
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:22,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...is clearly calling the shots as the new commander in chief.

1457
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:24,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I have John Cale on the line. - Cale?

1458
01:31:24,680 --> 01:31:27,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Where's Carol? - Finnerty's been relieved of command.

1459
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:31,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The cavalry's coming. Should be hitting the residence in a few minutes.

1460
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:33,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,no,no,not by air. They have to come by ground.

1461
01:31:33,900 --> 01:31:36,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I think we can handle this. - They have Javelin missiles.

1462
01:31:36,740 --> 01:31:38,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not according to our intel.

1463
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:41,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Even if we wanted to call them back,they've gone dark.

1464
01:31:41,530 --> 01:31:44,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If they fail,they're going to kill every single one of those hostages...

1465
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:47,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- ...including my daughter. - Just go.

1466
01:31:47,250 --> 01:31:49,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take this and stay out of sight.

1467
01:31:56,590 --> 01:31:58,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Thirty seconds! - Let's go!

1468
01:31:59,050 --> 01:32:01,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Incoming,three of them! Spread out!

1469
01:32:02,890 --> 01:32:07,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Castle in sight. I say again,Castle in sight.

1470
01:32:07,390 --> 01:32:11,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Are you ready? - Colonel,we got movement on the roof.

1471
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:13,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They've got missile lock! Evasive manoeuvres!

1472
01:32:14,610 --> 01:32:16,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Break right! Javelins! Javelins!

1473
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:17,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit!

1474
01:32:18,110 --> 01:32:20,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Break right! - I can't hold out! We're going down!

1475
01:32:20,950 --> 01:32:23,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Mayday! Mayday! - Shit.

1476
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:27,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get down! Incoming!

1477
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:29,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're going down!

1478
01:32:35,210 --> 01:32:37,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One is closing in on the White House.

1479
01:32:37,340 --> 01:32:40,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Looks like it's checking on the conditions of the hostages.

1480
01:32:44,220 --> 01:32:47,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you gonna do? You gonna shoot the hostages?

1481
01:32:47,310 --> 01:32:50,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get on the 50-cal! Mulcahy,let's go!

1482
01:32:51,480 --> 01:32:52,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hammer down! Hammer down!

1483
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:56,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fire!

1484
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:02,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pull up! Pull up!

1485
01:33:06,450 --> 01:33:07,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah!

1486
01:33:16,380 --> 01:33:17,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Last mag.

1487
01:33:18,630 --> 01:33:20,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They've got missile lock!

1488
01:33:27,970 --> 01:33:29,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Movement on the roof.

1489
01:33:41,950 --> 01:33:44,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold your fire! Hold your fire! I think that man is a friendly!

1490
01:33:53,290 --> 01:33:55,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get ready to deploy!

1491
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:58,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Fast-rope down! - Go,go!

1492
01:34:01,260 --> 01:34:03,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Get us out! Missile! - Javelin up ! Javelin up!

1493
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:04,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Countermeasures!

1494
01:34:04,930 --> 01:34:06,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Brace for impact!

1495
01:34:22,190 --> 01:34:23,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

1496
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:35,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This mission is going terribly wrong.

1497
01:34:35,210 --> 01:34:37,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can see now that there are two men on top of the roof...

1498
01:34:38,090 --> 01:34:40,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and they're engaged in hand-to-hand combat.

1499
01:35:55,290 --> 01:35:56,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit!

1500
01:36:21,150 --> 01:36:23,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes! Skip Tyler is in!

1501
01:36:24,860 --> 01:36:27,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Walker,that last firewall just came down.

1502
01:36:27,780 --> 01:36:29,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Tyler...

1503
01:36:30,530 --> 01:36:32,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...we are a go,sir.

1504
01:36:33,740 --> 01:36:35,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}God bless us all.

1505
01:37:02,190 --> 01:37:04,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sir. My weapons system is coming online.

1506
01:37:05,890 --> 01:37:07,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's being accessed remotely. I can't...

1507
01:37:08,150 --> 01:37:10,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Jesus Christ,it's targeting. - What?

1508
01:37:12,700 --> 01:37:14,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's firing.

1509
01:37:20,120 --> 01:37:22,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Target is an aircraft somewhere over Ohio.

1510
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:25,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Appears to be a modified 747.

1511
01:37:26,590 --> 01:37:27,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,my God.

1512
01:37:30,130 --> 01:37:32,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is an emergency. I repeat,this is an emergency.

1513
01:37:33,680 --> 01:37:35,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What's going on? - I don't know.

1514
01:37:35,430 --> 01:37:37,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...And fasten your seat belts. I repeat,this is...

1515
01:37:38,020 --> 01:37:39,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sir,we're under attack!

1516
01:38:04,380 --> 01:38:07,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's clear that someone on the inside has orchestrated...

1517
01:38:07,210 --> 01:38:10,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...this takeover of the White House. That's the only way...

1518
01:38:10,300 --> 01:38:14,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Speaker,we have confirmation of ground impact.

1519
01:38:14,970 --> 01:38:18,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We're going to need to swear you in,sir. - What?

1520
01:38:19,810 --> 01:38:23,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Executive power passed to the vice president when he was sworn in...

1521
01:38:23,390 --> 01:38:25,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...which means the office now passes to you.

1522
01:38:25,730 --> 01:38:28,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Sir. - Please follow these men.

1523
01:38:39,490 --> 01:38:42,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sir,these are your new presidential launch codes.

1524
01:38:42,370 --> 01:38:44,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please keep them on your person at all times.

1525
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:48,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need a moment here. I need... I need to call my wife.

1526
01:38:48,340 --> 01:38:49,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course,sir.

1527
01:38:50,090 --> 01:38:51,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

1528
01:38:54,380 --> 01:38:56,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Emily Cale.

1529
01:39:00,350 --> 01:39:03,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How are you enjoying your tour?

1530
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:04,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember these?

1531
01:39:04,520 --> 01:39:07,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You and I have a date,sweetheart.

1532
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:14,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll have to go through me.

1533
01:39:14,860 --> 01:39:17,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really?

1534
01:39:21,030 --> 01:39:24,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You're gonna go to jail for that! - And who's gonna make me?

1535
01:39:24,370 --> 01:39:26,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The tourist is still on the loose.

1536
01:39:26,460 --> 01:39:30,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I have a hunch Daddy's gonna come back for his little girl.

1537
01:39:30,380 --> 01:39:33,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- So he's still alive. - Not for very long,he isn't.

1538
01:39:34,670 --> 01:39:37,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't screw up this time! Motts!

1539
01:39:37,300 --> 01:39:38,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You stay here with him.

1540
01:39:38,930 --> 01:39:42,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey! Do I look like I need a babysitter?

1541
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:45,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sit down and shut up!

1542
01:39:57,610 --> 01:39:59,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,shit.

1543
01:40:03,700 --> 01:40:05,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Mr. President. - I...

1544
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:12,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}NORAD is fully compromised. Martin Walker now has the ability...

1545
01:40:12,250 --> 01:40:14,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...to launch missiles at any target in the United States.

1546
01:40:15,090 --> 01:40:17,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our satellites show massive troop movements...

1547
01:40:17,380 --> 01:40:19,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...in Russia,Pakistan and the Arabian Peninsula.

1548
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:21,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are your orders,sir?

1549
01:40:26,980 --> 01:40:30,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I swear to you all,I swear...

1550
01:40:31,150 --> 01:40:34,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...that we are not beaten yet. We are not!

1551
01:40:36,610 --> 01:40:37,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

1552
01:40:40,450 --> 01:40:41,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}General...

1553
01:40:43,240 --> 01:40:46,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...how soon can you execute an air strike on the White House?

1554
01:40:46,200 --> 01:40:47,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sir.

1555
01:40:47,410 --> 01:40:49,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can have Raptors on target in 10 minutes.

1556
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:52,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Then do it. - Let's go to work!

1557
01:40:52,630 --> 01:40:55,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Sir... - Carol,we have to end this. We have to.

1558
01:40:55,460 --> 01:40:58,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What if the next missile that he launches is aimed at Chicago or New York?

1559
01:40:59,090 --> 01:41:02,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We're talking about millions of lives. - Your first act as president...

1560
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:04,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...is going to be bombing the White House?

1561
01:41:04,850 --> 01:41:06,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Believe me,I know,I know.

1562
01:41:06,810 --> 01:41:08,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But our country is stronger than one house.

1563
01:41:09,140 --> 01:41:13,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is Mission Control. Raptor Alpha 1,clear to initiate Operation Free Castle.

1564
01:41:13,900 --> 01:41:16,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Copy that,Raptor Alpha 1 beginning approach.

1565
01:41:18,900 --> 01:41:21,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've lost two commanders in chief in one day.

1566
01:41:21,990 --> 01:41:25,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look,Mark,if I'm a foreign head of state,and the United States of America...

1567
01:41:25,830 --> 01:41:27,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...has become a rogue nuclear power...

1568
01:41:27,910 --> 01:41:31,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...at what point do I take action and step in...

1569
01:41:31,160 --> 01:41:33,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}perhaps even with a pre-emptive nuclear strike?

1570
01:41:36,670 --> 01:41:39,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Brought you a present.

1571
01:41:39,170 --> 01:41:40,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the tourist's daughter.

1572
01:41:42,220 --> 01:41:43,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,hello,hello.

1573
01:41:50,600 --> 01:41:52,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good morning,Mr. Cale.

1574
01:41:52,980 --> 01:41:56,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sitting here with someone who would like to say hello to you.

1575
01:41:56,190 --> 01:41:57,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Say hello,sweetie.

1576
01:42:05,620 --> 01:42:06,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Say hello,sweetie.

1577
01:42:09,200 --> 01:42:12,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right,then,would you like to tell your father...

1578
01:42:13,120 --> 01:42:16,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...what Mr. Stenz here is holding in his hand?

1579
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:20,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- A gun. - Now,Mr. Cale...

1580
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:22,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...I'm gonna start counting here...

1581
01:42:22,670 --> 01:42:27,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and if you don't give the president to my men by the time I've reached three...

1582
01:42:27,180 --> 01:42:31,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...Mr. Stenz here is gonna shoot your little girl in the stomach.

1583
01:42:34,900 --> 01:42:35,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One.

1584
01:42:41,900 --> 01:42:43,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two.

1585
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:49,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. No. No.

1586
01:42:52,750 --> 01:42:54,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm here.

1587
01:42:56,170 --> 01:42:58,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guess Daddy doesn't love you after all.

1588
01:43:02,510 --> 01:43:03,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got the president.

1589
01:43:06,300 --> 01:43:09,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Bring him on down. - Back to your office,sir.

1590
01:43:15,350 --> 01:43:17,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have John Cale on the line,sir.

1591
01:43:17,350 --> 01:43:18,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cale?

1592
01:43:18,610 --> 01:43:21,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You put her on the goddamn phone right now.

1593
01:43:22,070 --> 01:43:23,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hi,John. - They have the president.

1594
01:43:23,940 --> 01:43:26,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}John,I want you to listen to me. Help is not coming.

1595
01:43:26,910 --> 01:43:30,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I said they have the president. - They called a strike on the White House.

1596
01:43:30,620 --> 01:43:33,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The vice president is dead. You need to get out.

1597
01:43:33,290 --> 01:43:36,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They cannot do that. They still have hostages,they still have Emily.

1598
01:43:36,750 --> 01:43:39,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm so,so sorry. I was wrong about you...

1599
01:43:39,540 --> 01:43:42,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but there's nothing you can do,John. If you stay,you're gonna die.

1600
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need you to listen to me. My little girl is counting on me...

1601
01:43:46,090 --> 01:43:48,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and I am not gonna disappear on her.

1602
01:43:48,260 --> 01:43:50,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you tell me how much time I have.

1603
01:43:52,510 --> 01:43:55,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You only have eight minutes left to get them out.

1604
01:43:55,810 --> 01:43:57,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Goodbye,Carol.

1605
01:44:01,310 --> 01:44:03,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Clear out! We're moving back now!

1606
01:44:03,530 --> 01:44:06,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everybody's gotta move back! Everybody move back!

1607
01:44:06,190 --> 01:44:08,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you mean,evacuate? My daughter is in that building!

1608
01:44:09,990 --> 01:44:12,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is an emergency. Move back now!

1609
01:44:12,740 --> 01:44:14,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please! Clear the area now!

1610
01:44:17,080 --> 01:44:20,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Move back now! I said move back now!

1611
01:44:22,090 --> 01:44:23,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

1612
01:44:26,170 --> 01:44:28,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,there I am. That's not a bad picture.

1613
01:44:30,680 --> 01:44:32,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How'd they find out I did that one?

1614
01:44:35,310 --> 01:44:36,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buh-bye.

1615
01:44:37,270 --> 01:44:41,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whatever happened to "the pen is mightier than the sword"?

1616
01:44:43,690 --> 01:44:46,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Martin,as the president of the United States...

1617
01:44:46,230 --> 01:44:50,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...this comes with the full weight,power and authority of my office:

1618
01:44:51,030 --> 01:44:52,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck you.

1619
01:44:56,700 --> 01:45:00,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You okay? - Can we get down to business now?

1620
01:45:01,330 --> 01:45:03,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna need you to open this for me.

1621
01:45:04,380 --> 01:45:06,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What is that? - Oh,what are you doing?

1622
01:45:06,300 --> 01:45:08,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the nuclear football,sweetie.

1623
01:45:08,380 --> 01:45:13,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is keyed to the blood type and heartbeat of the president.

1624
01:45:13,850 --> 01:45:16,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What the hell is this? - This is the deal.

1625
01:45:19,100 --> 01:45:21,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a dozen reasons why that's not gonna work.

1626
01:45:21,560 --> 01:45:24,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Such as? - Even if I open it,my codes are useless.

1627
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:27,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They switched them out once you took over the building.

1628
01:45:27,730 --> 01:45:29,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You let me worry about that.

1629
01:45:31,030 --> 01:45:35,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's not a day that goes by that I don't feel terrible about losing your boy.

1630
01:45:35,330 --> 01:45:37,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But that's on me.

1631
01:45:37,330 --> 01:45:40,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So if you want revenge,then just shoot me.

1632
01:45:40,540 --> 01:45:43,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think I blame you for Kevin's death?

1633
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:46,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sending those men in was the most courageous thing...

1634
01:45:46,670 --> 01:45:48,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...you ever did in your life.

1635
01:45:48,380 --> 01:45:52,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were a true commander in chief for five minutes.

1636
01:45:52,260 --> 01:45:56,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You just don't have the balls to see the mission through.

1637
01:45:56,760 --> 01:45:58,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What mission?

1638
01:45:58,390 --> 01:46:01,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- There were no nuclear weapons in Iran. - But there will be.

1639
01:46:02,890 --> 01:46:05,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Middle East is our last war.

1640
01:46:05,730 --> 01:46:09,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It will be us or them.

1641
01:46:09,530 --> 01:46:13,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I choose that Kevin Charles Walker will be the last American soldier...

1642
01:46:13,950 --> 01:46:16,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...to die in that conflict in vain.

1643
01:46:16,740 --> 01:46:18,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want that as your son's legacy?

1644
01:46:18,370 --> 01:46:20,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Murdering millions of people in his name?

1645
01:46:20,450 --> 01:46:24,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. President,I wish the pen were mightier than the sword,I do.

1646
01:46:25,330 --> 01:46:26,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But it's just a dream.

1647
01:46:27,130 --> 01:46:28,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stand up,sir.

1648
01:46:28,630 --> 01:46:34,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}History will judge who the true patriots were here today.

1649
01:46:35,470 --> 01:46:40,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've been standing up,Martin,and I'm not gonna open that.

1650
01:46:50,360 --> 01:46:51,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Martin.

1651
01:46:53,450 --> 01:46:56,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Martin,that's not necessary.

1652
01:46:56,240 --> 01:46:57,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Martin!

1653
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:06,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How about now?

1654
01:47:09,090 --> 01:47:10,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't open this for him.

1655
01:47:11,420 --> 01:47:15,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I do,millions of people are gonna die,you understand that?

1656
01:47:17,180 --> 01:47:19,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I understand.

1657
01:47:23,350 --> 01:47:25,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Goddamn it!

1658
01:47:27,480 --> 01:47:29,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tyler,what the hell is going on?

1659
01:47:29,480 --> 01:47:33,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got thermal alarms going off in the second-floor dining room...

1660
01:47:33,400 --> 01:47:36,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...the West Sitting Hall,and the president's bedroom.

1661
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:39,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Killick,he's trying to burn the place. Second floor. Send your men.

1662
01:47:48,380 --> 01:47:52,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tyler? Turn off the goddamn sprinklers!

1663
01:47:54,090 --> 01:47:55,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who makes this shit?

1664
01:48:16,240 --> 01:48:17,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,shit!

1665
01:48:21,700 --> 01:48:22,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What was that?

1666
01:48:31,790 --> 01:48:33,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've been waiting all day to kill you.

1667
01:48:38,340 --> 01:48:44,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop hurting my White House!

1668
01:48:45,720 --> 01:48:50,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}German mantle clock. Empire style.

1669
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:52,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Killick,report!

1670
01:48:53,860 --> 01:48:56,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Killick,what the hell is happening? Report!

1671
01:48:56,570 --> 01:48:59,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Killick can't come to the phone. Where's my daughter?

1672
01:48:59,400 --> 01:49:00,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Dad! - She's here with me...

1673
01:49:01,030 --> 01:49:04,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...in the Oval Office,so why don't you come down and get her?

1674
01:49:04,780 --> 01:49:06,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What are you gonna do? - What do you think?

1675
01:49:07,500 --> 01:49:09,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why do you make all this shit personal?

1676
01:49:09,460 --> 01:49:11,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,you're talking to me about personal...

1677
01:49:11,580 --> 01:49:14,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...when you wanna blow up half the world for your kid!

1678
01:49:14,540 --> 01:49:17,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What are you gonna do? - What I should've done in the beginning.

1679
01:49:17,630 --> 01:49:19,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm gonna kill this prick. - Hey!

1680
01:49:19,630 --> 01:49:21,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What? - You lied to all of us.

1681
01:49:21,720 --> 01:49:23,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This was not the job.

1682
01:49:23,640 --> 01:49:26,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got business to finish. You stay here.

1683
01:49:26,430 --> 01:49:29,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- How do I get to the Oval Office? - Take the stairs to the ground floor...

1684
01:49:30,020 --> 01:49:31,980

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They've been told to evacuate too,but they're climbing the fence.

1785
01:56:23,560 --> 01:56:27,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay,we have confirmation. President Raphelson has ordered an air strike...

1786
01:56:28,060 --> 01:56:31,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...on the White House,and I can hear the planes coming.

1787
01:56:31,560 --> 01:56:33,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I... I have to go. I'm sorry.

1788
01:56:33,400 --> 01:56:36,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Delta 2-6,requesting permission to deliver payload.

1789
01:56:36,240 --> 01:56:37,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Raptor Alpha 1,you are clear.

1790
01:56:37,990 --> 01:56:40,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right,guys,let's clean it up.

1791
01:56:41,660 --> 01:56:45,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Delta 2-6,we're locked on target. Please confirm Free Castle is a go.

1792
01:56:45,910 --> 01:56:48,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Raptor Alpha 1,clear. Mission is a go.

1793
01:56:51,540 --> 01:56:54,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Delta 2-6,we have friendlies all over the kill zone.

1794
01:56:54,420 --> 01:56:58,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I cannot see the planes,but what I can see is an unbelievable sight.

1795
01:56:58,590 --> 01:57:02,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Emily Cale is out on the lawn,and she's waving the presidential flag.

1796
01:57:02,350 --> 01:57:04,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,baby. No,I told you to run! You gotta run!

1797
01:57:04,760 --> 01:57:07,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Captain,do you see this? Delta 2-6,we have a young girl on the lawn.

1798
01:57:08,140 --> 01:57:10,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think she's trying to wave off the air strike.

1799
01:57:10,520 --> 01:57:13,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Sir,requesting permission to abort. - Mr. President,please.

1800
01:57:13,480 --> 01:57:16,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sir! Sir! I need an answer.

1801
01:57:16,190 --> 01:57:20,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not doing this,guys. Abort mission. Pull out! Abort! Abort! Abort!

1802
01:57:22,110 --> 01:57:23,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

1803
01:57:25,120 --> 01:57:27,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They have flown over the White House.

1804
01:57:27,200 --> 01:57:29,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is an unbelievable moment down here.

1805
01:57:29,620 --> 01:57:31,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}People are going wild.

1806
01:57:31,290 --> 01:57:35,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And Emily Cale is undoubtedly a beautiful hero of the day.

1807
01:57:35,880 --> 01:57:37,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Emily Cale is a little hero.

1808
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:41,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is an unprecedented moment in U.S. history.

1809
01:57:58,400 --> 01:58:00,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That search you requested came back.

1810
01:58:04,530 --> 01:58:08,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Emily,can you believe how many people have seen your video blog?

1811
01:58:08,740 --> 01:58:11,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not a video blog. It's a YouTube channel.

1812
01:58:11,290 --> 01:58:14,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- How many? - Seven hundred million people.

1813
01:58:14,580 --> 01:58:16,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Daughters.

1814
01:58:16,420 --> 01:58:17,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jesus!

1815
01:58:18,250 --> 01:58:20,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,my God. Are you okay?

1816
01:58:21,760 --> 01:58:24,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honest Abe. My wife got this for me.

1817
01:58:24,590 --> 01:58:26,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For the inauguration.

1818
01:58:30,140 --> 01:58:32,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you kidding me? You got shot in the wa...?

1819
01:58:32,440 --> 01:58:37,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What I'm telling you is that good old Abe took a second bullet for me.

1820
01:58:41,650 --> 01:58:43,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

1821
01:58:44,030 --> 01:58:46,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you for what you did for Emily.

1822
01:58:46,870 --> 01:58:48,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's my sacrifice,right?

1823
01:58:49,700 --> 01:58:50,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes,sir.

1824
01:58:56,880 --> 01:58:57,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yep.

1825
01:58:58,090 --> 01:59:00,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}John,listen.

1826
01:59:00,420 --> 01:59:01,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This isn't over yet.

1827
01:59:01,880 --> 01:59:03,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Walker had no prior contact...

1828
01:59:03,630 --> 01:59:06,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with any of the terrorists,but someone else did.

1829
01:59:06,390 --> 01:59:09,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait,wait,wait. Hold on. I'm gonna put you on speaker.

1830
01:59:09,430 --> 01:59:11,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- The president's with me. - This guy,Stenz...

1831
01:59:11,930 --> 01:59:14,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...made multiple calls to a secure line in D.C...

1832
01:59:14,310 --> 01:59:18,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but we don't know who received them. The database was wiped 30 minutes ago.

1833
01:59:18,360 --> 01:59:20,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really? Did you check Walker's personal records?

1834
01:59:20,730 --> 01:59:23,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His computer,his e-mails?

1835
01:59:23,240 --> 01:59:25,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't know Walker,John. He was a dinosaur.

1836
01:59:25,530 --> 01:59:27,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The man still used a pager.

1837
01:59:28,570 --> 01:59:29,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,shit.

1838
01:59:32,950 --> 01:59:35,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen. Carol,I got to check something out.

1839
01:59:35,750 --> 01:59:37,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll see you outside.

1840
01:59:40,590 --> 01:59:42,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't believe it.

1841
01:59:42,250 --> 01:59:47,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think I know how Walker got the codes,but I'm gonna need your help,sir.

1842
01:59:53,350 --> 01:59:55,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Move back! Move back.

1843
01:59:55,430 --> 01:59:56,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Emily.

1844
01:59:58,600 --> 02:00:02,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,baby,you okay? Oh,thank God.

1845
02:00:02,530 --> 02:00:04,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank God,baby.

1846
02:00:10,990 --> 02:00:14,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Did you see my routine? - Yeah.

1847
02:00:14,290 --> 02:00:19,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,I'm so proud of you. You were beautiful,baby.

1848
02:00:19,290 --> 02:00:22,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You saved us. You know that?

1849
02:00:24,420 --> 02:00:27,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey,stay with Mommy for a second,okay? I'll be right back.

1850
02:00:30,890 --> 02:00:33,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- John. - It's disarmed.

1851
02:00:33,720 --> 02:00:36,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank God you're all right. Where's the president?

1852
02:00:38,810 --> 02:00:39,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He didn't make it,sir.

1853
02:00:46,190 --> 02:00:48,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need to address the nation.

1854
02:00:48,570 --> 02:00:50,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}General,get on with the Joint Chiefs.

1855
02:00:50,990 --> 02:00:54,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We need to move our troops into the Middle East to stabilise the region.

1856
02:00:54,660 --> 02:00:56,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wanna move troops in?

1857
02:00:56,410 --> 02:00:59,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When they find out that we almost launched a nuclear attack...

1858
02:00:59,460 --> 02:01:01,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...there's gonna be chaos. We have to contain it.

1859
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:05,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Can I ask you a question? - Of course. Yeah.

1860
02:01:05,300 --> 02:01:07,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When did you and Walker cook this whole thing up?

1861
02:01:07,720 --> 02:01:08,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Excuse me? - How'd it go?

1862
02:01:09,010 --> 02:01:11,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You gave Walker the launch codes and he made you president?

1863
02:01:13,050 --> 02:01:14,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can prove this?

1864
02:01:17,020 --> 02:01:20,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,Walker had to get the launch codes from somewhere...

1865
02:01:20,190 --> 02:01:22,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}... and you were the only person with those codes.

1866
02:01:23,190 --> 02:01:25,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I found this pager in Walker's pocket.

1867
02:01:25,360 --> 02:01:27,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I only know one other person that uses one of these.

1868
02:01:29,740 --> 02:01:31,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That doesn't prove anything.

1869
02:01:31,780 --> 02:01:34,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two old guys use old technology. So what?

1870
02:01:35,490 --> 02:01:39,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why don't you call the return number on that,Carol?

1871
02:01:42,580 --> 02:01:45,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Would have been better if the evidence had been destroyed...

1872
02:01:45,540 --> 02:01:47,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}... in the air strike that you ordered.

1873
02:01:54,220 --> 02:01:55,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're a goddamn traitor,sir.

1874
02:01:58,890 --> 02:02:00,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You dim little shit.

1875
02:02:00,680 --> 02:02:03,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hired you out of pity and this is how you repay me.

1876
02:02:03,900 --> 02:02:06,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tomorrow,when people find out that your precious president...

1877
02:02:07,150 --> 02:02:09,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...helped a maniac open the nuclear football...

1878
02:02:09,740 --> 02:02:12,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...who do you think they're going to believe,you or me?

1879
02:02:12,570 --> 02:02:14,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You,you would be a nobody.

1880
02:02:14,870 --> 02:02:17,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But me,I'm the president of the United States.

1881
02:02:18,080 --> 02:02:19,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,you're not.

1882
