1
00:00:02,555 --> 00:00:03,726
星际之门 亚特兰蒂斯
前情提要
Previously on Stargate Atlantis...

2
00:00:03,812 --> 00:00:05,984
不论我们打算藏在这颗星球的什么地方
No matter were we try to hide
on this planet,

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,611
复制体的卫星都将会找到我们
the Replicator satellite
will be able to track us.

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,446
Atlantis要离开这颗星球
Atlantis is leaving.

5
00:00:10,546 --> 00:00:13,641
- 我们飞行的高度不够
- 我们的能量不够
- We're not flying high enough.
- We don't have enough power.

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:18,487
我们迷路了
We are lost.

7
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:21,747
我们过早的跌出了超空间
我对我们在什么地方毫无头绪
We dropped out of hyperspace way
too soon. I have no idea where we are.

8
00:00:21,827 --> 00:00:23,924
她没有反应 瞳孔也反应迟钝
She's unresponsive
and her pupils are sluggish.

9
00:00:24,073 --> 00:00:26,395
在我们到那里以前
准备好手术室和扫描仪
Prep the OR and have the scanner
ready when we get there.

10
00:00:26,584 --> 00:00:28,998
一些主要的管线受到光束扫射的影响
Several conduits were affected
by the brush with the beam.

11
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,147
她出现脑水肿
She's suffering from cerebral oedema,

12
00:00:31,229 --> 00:00:33,656
而且可能已经导致实质性的脑损伤
which may have caused
substantial brain damage.

13
00:00:33,736 --> 00:00:35,513
- 那是什么
- 小行星带?
- What is that?
- An asteroid belt?

14
00:00:35,593 --> 00:00:38,911
我们要用Drone导弹在小行星带中
开辟出一条通道来
We're gonna clear a path through
the belt by firing our drones.

15
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,897
Elizabeth快不行了 如果想要救她
我们必须现在就动手
Elizabeth's crashing. If we
do this thing, we need to do it now.

16
00:00:41,994 --> 00:00:43,020
你做了什么
What did you do?

17
00:00:43,192 --> 00:00:44,814
- 我重新激活了纳米元件
- 该死 McKay
- I reactivated the nanites.
- Dammit!

18
00:00:44,894 --> 00:00:47,922
听着 我100%肯定它们不会控制她
也不会和别的复制体联系
But I'm certain they're not gonna try
to take her over or contact the others!

19
00:00:48,002 --> 00:00:49,568
这是一个非常糟糕的主意
This is a very bad idea.

20
00:00:49,691 --> 00:00:51,513
那里有拥有ZPM的星球吗
There's a planet out there with ZPMs?

21
00:00:51,594 --> 00:00:53,498
那里是复制体的老家
That would be the Replicator homeworld.

22
00:00:54,442 --> 00:00:55,775
你是不是有想去打劫的念头?
You feel up to a heist?

23
00:01:10,768 --> 00:01:13,114
好了 当我说可以了
就试试看左边的线
OK, when I say,
go ahead and try the left one.

24
00:01:14,623 --> 00:01:16,417
上帝啊 我说了"要等我说可以了"
Geez!
I said, "when I say!"

25
00:01:16,498 --> 00:01:17,756
我以为你已经说了
I thought you did say!

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,203
进展如何 伙计们
How's it going, boys?

27
00:01:19,523 --> 00:01:21,106
如果不是他每2秒钟就企图杀死我一次
We'd be making a lot more progress

28
00:01:21,188 --> 00:01:23,816
我们的进展会更大
if Timmy Torture over here wasn't
trying to kill me every 2 sec.

29
00:01:23,896 --> 00:01:25,729
我没有企图杀死他
I'm not trying to kill him.

30
00:01:27,097 --> 00:01:29,496
那么 你们到底能不能让它进行超空间跳跃?
So, can you make it
jump into hyperspace or not?

31
00:01:29,718 --> 00:01:30,719
是的 我想可以
Yes, I think so.

32
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,403
- 你想你可以?
- 是的 我想
- You think so?
- Yes, think.

33
00:01:32,589 --> 00:01:34,113
你说过你能做到的
You said you could do it.

34
00:01:34,275 --> 00:01:36,490
纠正一下 我说过"可能"做到
Correction I said "probably" do it.

35
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:40,277
是的 他在一个他上次接近升天时
创立的算法上遇到点麻烦
Yes, he has trouble with an algorithm
he created during his near-ascension.

36
00:01:40,358 --> 00:01:43,581
这是难以想象的复杂的物理学 你明白么
This is unbelievably complex
physics here, alright?

37
00:01:43,663 --> 00:01:46,823
我是说 它使得线性理论
看上去像是非线性动力学
I mean, it makes string theory look
like non-linear dynamics.

38
00:01:48,038 --> 00:01:49,342
而且即使我可以让它工作
Even if I do get it working,

39
00:01:49,422 --> 00:01:52,207
依然会有成千上万个地方
可能出现十分可怕的错误
there's still a thousand things
that could go terribly, terribly wrong.

40
00:01:52,288 --> 00:01:55,564
我明白了 这很困难
万分之一的机会 等等 等等...
I get it, it's difficult.
Million-to-one odds...

41
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:59,177
你还需要什么东西么
抑或你就是来这里打击我们的?
Was there something else you needed,
or were you here to prod and belittle?

42
00:01:59,257 --> 00:02:00,260
不 不
No, not.

43
00:02:00,838 --> 00:02:01,966
不只是这样
Not merely.

44
00:02:02,046 --> 00:02:04,515
还有一个问题我们必须思考
There's another problem
we need to be thinking about.

45
00:02:04,596 --> 00:02:07,062
例如 我们到了那以后该怎么做
Such as, what do we do
when we get there?

46
00:02:07,969 --> 00:02:10,227
找到能跳进超空间的办法
也许是其中最简单的部分
Getting this thing to jump
into hyperspace may be easy.

47
00:02:10,309 --> 00:02:12,606
潜入城市 偷走ZPM
Infiltrating the city, stealing the ZPM,

48
00:02:12,688 --> 00:02:14,771
然后再全身而退 我觉得那有些风险
and getting out,
I think that's a little dicey.

49
00:02:14,867 --> 00:02:15,859
退一步说
To say the least.

50
00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:17,594
- 我已经考虑过这个问题了
- 然后呢
- I've been thinking about that.
- And?

51
00:02:17,676 --> 00:02:20,558
我认为如果我们要成功的话
And I think that if we stand
any chance of succeeding,

52
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,129
我们得需要些帮助
we're gonna need some help.

53
00:02:22,455 --> 00:02:23,475
找谁帮忙
From who?

54
00:02:33,373 --> 00:02:34,756
想去做次旅行么
Feel like taking a trip?

55
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:44,500
星际之门 亚特兰蒂斯
第04季 第02集
生命线


Season 4 Episode 02
- Lifeline (v. 1.00) -

56
00:03:45,246 --> 00:03:46,503
我认为在你体内的纳米元件
The nanites inside you,

57
00:03:46,597 --> 00:03:48,337
如果能短距离靠近
I think, if we got them
in close proximity

58
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:49,957
人形复制体的城市
to the human-form Replicator's city,

59
00:03:50,037 --> 00:03:52,129
我就能操作它们远程侵入
I'd be able to manipulate them
to remotely hack

60
00:03:52,212 --> 00:03:53,742
复制体的主机
into the Replicator mainframe.

61
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:57,269
这样我们就能够找到
最近的ZPM和最快进出的路
We'd be able to find out the closest ZPM
and the quickest way to get in and out.

62
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,831
不但如此 同时我们还能追踪它们的行动
Not only that, we'd be able to track
their movement as well.

63
00:03:59,913 --> 00:04:01,824
在它们发现我们之前就能知道它们要来了
We'll know they're coming
before they spot us.

64
00:04:01,904 --> 00:04:03,785
但这样也不能排除危险
Which does not eliminate the danger.

65
00:04:04,059 --> 00:04:05,099
差很多
Far from it.

66
00:04:05,181 --> 00:04:06,922
但确实给我们相当大的优势
But it does give us a significant edge.

67
00:04:07,004 --> 00:04:10,249
如果复制体控制了我体内的
纳米元件会怎么样
What happens if the Replicators take
control of the nanites inside me?

68
00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:12,539
- 它们不会 我会阻止所有的尝试...
- 但是如果它们成功了呢
- They won't. I'd block any attempt...
- But if they do?

69
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:15,108
我已经让Rodney在纳米元件的
代码里加入了一个终止开关
I ordered Rodney to write a kill switch
into the nanites' code.

70
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:18,058
如果我们触发程序
就会将他们无效化
If we trigger the program,
it'll neutralize them.

71
00:04:20,687 --> 00:04:22,637
无效化 你是说使它们停止工作?
Neutralize them,
you mean shut them off?

72
00:04:23,019 --> 00:04:24,153
是的
Yes.

73
00:04:24,233 --> 00:04:27,033
而你说过是这些纳米元件
是我可以维持生命的全部原因
And you said the nanites are
all that are keeping me alive.

74
00:04:27,798 --> 00:04:28,853
是的
They are.

75
00:04:29,355 --> 00:04:31,435
如果我们关掉它们 就会...
If we shut them off, it will...

76
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,314
杀死你
kill you.

77
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,901
但这是不会发生的
But that's not gonna happen.

78
00:04:38,036 --> 00:04:39,042
对么
Alright?

79
00:04:39,355 --> 00:04:42,810
我已经让Rodney盯紧这些小混蛋
确保它们不会捣乱
I've ordered Rodney to keep an eye
on the bastards, make sure they behave.

80
00:04:43,801 --> 00:04:45,548
若不是因为这是此次任务成功的唯一机会
We would not ask this
of you if it was not

81
00:04:45,629 --> 00:04:47,828
我们也不会请求你这么做的
the only chance of
this mission succeeding.

82
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:52,121
她说得对 如果我们弄不到ZPM 大家都会...
She's right, if we don't get hold
of a ZPM, the City and everyone in...

83
00:04:52,215 --> 00:04:53,507
我们什么时候出发
When do we leave?

84
00:04:55,818 --> 00:04:56,827
就现在
Right now.

85
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:57,972
什么 等等
What? Wait,

86
00:04:58,052 --> 00:05:01,167
不 不 不 不是现在
听着 我还没有最终完成动力...
No... not right now. Look, I haven't
finished finalizing the power distrib...

87
00:05:01,249 --> 00:05:03,111
那就完成它 我们要出发了
Finalize it. We need to move.

88
00:05:13,218 --> 00:05:14,965
你不会有事的 Elizabeth
You're gonna be OK, Elizabeth.

89
00:05:15,617 --> 00:05:16,620
尽管如此
Still,

90
00:05:17,065 --> 00:05:19,833
我要你们所有人都紧紧的盯住我
I would like all of you
to keep a very close eye on me,

91
00:05:19,914 --> 00:05:22,021
一旦有任何可疑的举动
and the first sign
of any suspicious behavior,

92
00:05:22,102 --> 00:05:24,198
要毫不犹豫的启动终止程序
do not hesitate
with that kill switch.

93
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:27,954
- 好的 但这是不会发生的...
- John 我是说真的
- OK, but that's not gonna happen...
- John, I mean it.

94
00:05:35,634 --> 00:05:36,640
嘿 Teyla
Hey, Teyla!

95
00:05:37,267 --> 00:05:38,273
等等
Wait up.

96
00:05:41,292 --> 00:05:43,413
我需要你留在这儿
I'm gonna need you
to sit this one out.

97
00:05:43,792 --> 00:05:45,411
John 如果这次任务不能成功的话...
John, if this mission is not successful

98
00:05:45,492 --> 00:05:47,225
Zelenka认为他找到了一个
Zelenka thinks he found a planet

99
00:05:47,307 --> 00:05:48,924
适合人类生存的行星
that can sustain human life.

100
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:52,152
他十分有信心可以通过
一次跳跃就让城市到达那里
He's fairly confident that he can get
the City there in one jump.

101
00:05:52,232 --> 00:05:54,275
没有护盾 我们将无法降落
Without the shields,
we will be unable to land.

102
00:05:54,357 --> 00:05:58,034
我知道 我们也没有足够的能量
来建立环绕轨道
I know. We won't even have enough
power to establish orbit.

103
00:05:59,089 --> 00:06:02,212
所以要进行低空飞越
让所有人都坐上Jumper
You're gonna have to do a fly-by,
and get everybody else in the Jumper.

104
00:06:02,292 --> 00:06:04,767
- 你是说放弃这座城市
- 是的 如果走到那一步的话
- You mean abandon the City.
- Well, if it comes to that.

105
00:06:05,942 --> 00:06:07,811
好了 这些人将会需要一位领导
Alright, these people
are gonna need a leader.

106
00:06:07,905 --> 00:06:10,952
能保证他们活下去
把他们团结在一起的人 更重要的是
Somebody who can keep them alive, keep
them together, more importantly, not

107
00:06:11,046 --> 00:06:12,382
不让他们放弃希望
let them give up hope.

108
00:06:13,668 --> 00:06:14,739
那个人就是你 Teyla
That's you, Teyla.

109
00:06:14,933 --> 00:06:17,042
- John...
- 听着 如果我12个小时后没回来
Look, if I'm not back twelve hours,

110
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:18,881
就下命令
give the order.

111
00:06:28,561 --> 00:06:29,586
好了
Alright.

112
00:06:30,213 --> 00:06:31,216
开始
Now.

113
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:33,625
- 你肯定?
- 是的
- Are you certain?
- Yes.

114
00:06:34,869 --> 00:06:38,438
- 我这么问是因为上一次你不够确定...
- Radek
I only ask 'cause the last time you were
less than definitive in your answer...

115
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:40,027
好吧
Alright.

116
00:06:44,829 --> 00:06:46,638
- 行了
- 是么
- OK.
- Yes?

117
00:06:47,691 --> 00:06:50,219
- 我想我们成功了
- 很好 很好 现在...
- I think we got it.
- Good, good, now...

118
00:06:50,553 --> 00:06:52,619
现在只要我们不在第一次跳跃时
now, as long as we don't
burn up all of the power

119
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:54,122
就耗尽所有的能量 那么...
on the initial jump, then...

120
00:06:54,985 --> 00:06:56,399
是的 是的 好的 是的
Yes, yes, right, OK.

121
00:06:57,025 --> 00:06:58,031
我现在就走
I'll leave now.

122
00:07:02,983 --> 00:07:05,927
- 准备好了吗
- 是的 听着 我依然不确定这能否成功
- You ready?
- Yes. I'm not sure if it's gonna work,

123
00:07:06,023 --> 00:07:07,668
我是说 我已经做了所有我能做的来确保...
I've done everything
I can to make it.

124
00:07:07,748 --> 00:07:09,214
Sheppard 我们准备好了
Sheppard, we're ready.

125
00:07:28,272 --> 00:07:30,070
好了 Teyla 我们准备好出发了
Alright Teyla, we're ready to launch.

126
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,198
明白
Understood.

127
00:07:31,453 --> 00:07:33,242
打开Jumper船坞的舱门
Open the Jumper bay doors.

128
00:07:34,042 --> 00:07:36,812
记住 我们离开以后别开什么疯狂派对
Remember, no wild parties
while we're gone.

129
00:07:37,432 --> 00:07:39,147
我们会努力保持克制的
We will try to restrain ourselves.

130
00:07:40,395 --> 00:07:41,554
祝你们好运
Good luck.

131
00:07:41,955 --> 00:07:43,830
好的 我们出发
Alright, here we go.

132
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,243
Rodney 准备好了吗
Rodney, you ready?

133
00:07:54,994 --> 00:07:57,972
我有没有提过这不一定会成功
我们同样有可能过早
Did I mention that this might not work?
And that we could either drop out of

134
00:07:58,052 --> 00:08:01,088
跌出超空间
然后搁浅在深层空间中心
hyperspace prematurely and end up
stranded in the middle of deep space,

135
00:08:01,175 --> 00:08:03,510
或者可能在我按下按钮时就被蒸发了
or quite possibly, be vaporized
the moment I touch that.

136
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,136
回答那个该死的问题就可以了
Just answer the damn question.

137
00:08:06,507 --> 00:08:07,656
是的 准备好了
Yeah, I'm ready.

138
00:08:07,736 --> 00:08:08,954
好的 坐下
Good, sit down.

139
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,117
开始吧
Here goes.

140
00:08:16,372 --> 00:08:19,488
好的 打开超空间窗口 3
OK, opening
hyperspace window in three,

141
00:08:20,062 --> 00:08:21,073
2
two,

142
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,448
1...
one...

143
00:08:32,239 --> 00:08:35,218
我的天啊 这...这太美丽了
Oh my! that's... beautiful.

144
00:08:35,464 --> 00:08:36,544
是的
Yeah, it is.

145
00:08:37,104 --> 00:08:38,731
就像是艾尔文森林一样
(Elwynn forest 魔兽世界中的地图 这位仁兄是粉丝)
It's like Elwynn Forest.

146
00:08:39,973 --> 00:08:41,122
没什么
Oh, nothing, it's

147
00:08:41,202 --> 00:08:43,035
那是魔兽世界里的一片大地
one of the lands in Warcraft.

148
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,167
那是我玩的一个游戏
That's a game I play.

149
00:08:46,725 --> 00:08:48,256
好吧 偶尔
Well, occasionally.

150
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:51,762


151
00:08:53,006 --> 00:08:54,359
你没事吧
You gonna be OK?

152
00:08:54,632 --> 00:08:57,366
是的 是的 我只是...你知道
我不是经常来地外世界
Yeah, I just... you know,
I don't get to get offworld much,

153
00:08:57,446 --> 00:08:58,910
或者说 几乎没有过
or ever, hardly.

154
00:08:59,015 --> 00:09:01,298
你最好拍张照 我们不会在这儿呆很久
You'd better take a picture
we're not gonna be here long.

155
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:02,760
对 好主意
Right, good idea.

156
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:05,066
这里是Carter上校 呼叫Apollo号
This is Colonel Carter
calling the Apollo.

157
00:09:05,146 --> 00:09:06,658
Ellis上校 收到了么
Colonel Ellis, do you read?

158
00:09:06,738 --> 00:09:08,188
很清楚 上校
Five by five, Colonel.

159
00:09:08,571 --> 00:09:11,331
我们已经穿过星门 准备好传送
We've stepped through the Gate
and are ready for transport.

160
00:09:11,411 --> 00:09:13,570
- 不 等等 等等...
- 准备
- No, wait...
- Stand-by.

161
00:09:21,725 --> 00:09:23,911
欢迎来到天马星系 上校
Welcome to the Pegasus galaxy, Colonel.

162
00:09:24,294 --> 00:09:27,356
谢谢 依然没有Atlantis的消息?
Thank you.
Still no word from Atlantis?

163
00:09:27,783 --> 00:09:28,890
什么也没有
Nothing.

164
00:09:29,491 --> 00:09:31,045
我已经用你建议的对传感器阵列的修正
I've been going over the specs

165
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:34,047
对这片空间重新进行了察看
for these modifications you're proposing
for the sensor array.

166
00:09:34,127 --> 00:09:37,911
你要求增加5倍的能量?
You're asking for a five-fold increase
in power consumption?

167
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:41,416
还想从另外6个关键系统调拨部件
Plus, you want to cannibalize parts
from half a dozen other key

168
00:09:41,496 --> 00:09:44,005
包括亚空间通讯系统
systems, including
subspace communications.

169
00:09:44,379 --> 00:09:45,431
说的对
That's correct.

170
00:09:45,681 --> 00:09:47,222
如果他们试图和我们联系 怎么办
What if they try and contact us?

171
00:09:48,015 --> 00:09:50,144
如果他们能的话 应该已经做了
If they could, they would have done it.

172
00:09:50,308 --> 00:09:51,982
所有这些都基于
All of this is based on the assumption

173
00:09:52,062 --> 00:09:54,067
假设他们过早跌出超空间的基础上
that they dropped out
of hyperspace early.

174
00:09:54,318 --> 00:09:57,257
是的 我们相信那是最有可能的情形
Yeah, we believe
that's the most likely scenario.

175
00:09:58,662 --> 00:10:00,206
好吧 我们开始吧
Alright, let's do it.

176
00:10:14,434 --> 00:10:15,914
祝贺你 Rodney
Congratulations, Rodney.

177
00:10:15,994 --> 00:10:17,437
你的超空间引擎成功了
Your hyperdrive worked.

178
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,460
不幸的是 信不信由你
Unfortunately, believe it or not,

179
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,306
事实上Zelenka是对的
Zelenka was actually right.

180
00:10:21,634 --> 00:10:23,425
我们在跳跃上消耗了
We burned up way more power on the jump

181
00:10:23,505 --> 00:10:24,723
比预期更多的能量
than we expected.

182
00:10:24,996 --> 00:10:26,835
什么意思 我们回不去了?
What are you saying?
We can't get back?

183
00:10:26,915 --> 00:10:29,201
不 不 我说的是...
No, what I am saying is that the...

184
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:32,418
实际上 那正是我要说的
Actually,
that's exactly what I'm saying.

185
00:10:32,713 --> 00:10:35,071
我认为 只要我们偷到ZPM
就可以利用它的能量
I suppose, once we steal the ZPM,
I could utilise its power.

186
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:38,682
- 我要确认一下我没有过载...
- 让我们一步一步来 好么
- Need to make sure I don't overload...
- Let's take this one step at a time!

187
00:10:38,856 --> 00:10:39,984
先做重要的事
First things first.

188
00:10:40,064 --> 00:10:41,972
让我们想想如何弄到ZPM
Let's worry about getting the ZPM.

189
00:10:42,464 --> 00:10:43,477
对
Right.

190
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,328
- 好吧 我要尝试初始化连接
- 你需要我做什么
- I'm gonna try to initialize the link.
- What do you want me to do?

191
00:10:48,408 --> 00:10:50,610
什么也不用做 就坐在那
完全是无线连接的
Nothing. Just sit there.
It's completely wireless.

192
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,908
如果有什么东西涌入你的大脑就告诉我
Let me know if anything
pops into your mind.

193
00:10:53,233 --> 00:10:54,443
什么意思
What do you mean?

194
00:10:54,523 --> 00:10:56,390
是我会感知到什么
Will I just sort of sense something,

195
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,780
还是更加...
or is it more of a...

196
00:10:59,834 --> 00:11:00,834
上帝啊
Oh, my God.

197
00:11:04,476 --> 00:11:05,248
我做到了
I did it.

198
00:11:05,328 --> 00:11:07,086
我是说 她做到了
I mean, she did it.

199
00:11:09,198 --> 00:11:12,134
但我们动作要迅速
尽管她的纳米元件只在"潜水模式"
But we have to move fast. Even though
her nanites are in lurking mode,

200
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:15,388
但用不了多久复制体就会发现
有别的玩家加入了游戏
won't take long for them to figure out
another player has joined the game.

201
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,117
你感觉如何 Elizabeth
How you feeling, Elizabeth?

202
00:11:17,197 --> 00:11:18,382
很奇怪
Very strange.

203
00:11:19,334 --> 00:11:22,159
我突然可以在面前看到整个城市
I can suddenly see the entire city
directly in front of me.

204
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,858
每一条通道 每一间房间...
Every corridor, every single room...

205
00:11:30,091 --> 00:11:31,102
那边
That way.

206
00:11:31,403 --> 00:11:32,456
ZPM
The ZPM.

207
00:11:33,885 --> 00:11:37,808
第四象限 最高层 很容易接近
周围几乎没有人
Fourth quadrant, top level, easy access.
There's hardly anyone around.

208
00:11:38,942 --> 00:11:40,418
好的 对我来说是个好消息
Alright, works for me.

209
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:57,260
好的 我们着陆了
Rodney和Elizabeth呆在这儿
Alright, we're down.
Rodney, stay here with Elizabeth,

210
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,358
过滤情报 你们可以通过无线电指引我们
keep sifting through the intel.
You guys can guide us through by radio.

211
00:12:02,272 --> 00:12:04,480
Jumper后方左侧20米处
Twenty meters to the left
behind the jumper,

212
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,887
有个入口
there's an access door.

213
00:12:05,967 --> 00:12:07,264
往下走过一段楼梯
Down one flight of stairs,

214
00:12:07,344 --> 00:12:09,092
会进入7号附属通道
you'll enter auxiliary corridor seven.

215
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,400
现在快去 那里没人
Go now, it's clear.

216
00:12:29,267 --> 00:12:30,879
我们到达通道了
We're at the corridor.

217
00:12:30,961 --> 00:12:32,130
往右
Go right.

218
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,383
走6.5米
At 6.5 meters,

219
00:12:33,463 --> 00:12:35,943
- 应该有另一个通道
- 好的 我们看到了
- there should be another corridor.
- OK, we see it.

220
00:12:36,023 --> 00:12:37,587
向左 等等 回去
Turn left. Wait! Go back!

221
00:12:41,031 --> 00:12:42,889
没事 他没看到你们
It's alright, he didn't see you.

222
00:12:42,969 --> 00:12:44,652
真的吗 这些你都知道?
Really? You know that?

223
00:12:46,346 --> 00:12:48,755
是的 就像我说的 非常奇怪
Yeah. Like I said, it's very strange.

224
00:12:50,553 --> 00:12:51,708
我们现在能过去了吗
Can we go now?

225
00:12:52,275 --> 00:12:53,313
是的 去吧
Yes, go.

226
00:12:57,096 --> 00:12:58,544
往左 然后往右
Turn left, then right.

227
00:13:08,806 --> 00:13:10,691
它应该就在你们面前
It should be directly in front of you.

228
00:13:10,771 --> 00:13:12,120
是的 我看到它了
Yeah, I see it.

229
00:13:13,548 --> 00:13:14,768
别着急 野人(Chewie 星球大战里的)
Hold up, Chewie.

230
00:13:18,611 --> 00:13:21,236
我们把它拔出来的时候
它们不就注意到了么
Aren't they gonna notice
when we pull the plug on this thing?

231
00:13:21,316 --> 00:13:23,067
很有可能 但是它们有几十个ZPM
Probably,
but they've got dozens of ZPMs.

232
00:13:23,147 --> 00:13:25,932
希望他们发现的时候 我们早已远走高飞
Let's just hope that they don't notice
until we're long gone.

233
00:13:26,085 --> 00:13:27,620
那只是你一厢情愿而已
That's wishful thinking.

234
00:13:27,743 --> 00:13:29,011
我们依然是安全的吗
We still in the clear?

235
00:13:29,417 --> 00:13:32,329
离你们2条通道的地方
有一小队复制体 正朝你们那里过去
There's a small group of Replicators
two corridors over, heading your way,

236
00:13:32,409 --> 00:13:34,018
所以你们动作必须快点儿
so you need to move quickly.

237
00:13:41,262 --> 00:13:42,287
到手了
Got it.

238
00:13:42,984 --> 00:13:44,265
我们这就回去
We're on our way.

239
00:13:57,449 --> 00:13:58,885
连接ZPM 我们出发
Hook up the ZPM, we're leaving.

240
00:13:58,965 --> 00:14:01,380
- 等等 我们还不能走
- 你在说什么
- Wait a minute. We can't go.
- What are you talking about?

241
00:14:01,499 --> 00:14:03,512
你说你可以让超光速引擎重新工作的
You said you could get
the hyperdrive back online.

242
00:14:03,601 --> 00:14:06,413
我的意思是 我们可以走 但还不是时候
听着 当Elizabeth接入以后
I mean, we can, but not yet. Look,
while Elizabeth's been connected,

243
00:14:06,515 --> 00:14:09,831
我检查了复制体的基础代码
发现了这个
I've been going over the Replicator's
base code, and I found this.

244
00:14:11,688 --> 00:14:12,766
那是什么
What is that?

245
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:15,578
圣杯
The Holy Grail.

246
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,530
这是他们存在的所有原因
It's their whole reason for being.

247
00:14:17,864 --> 00:14:20,437
这是一条指挥它们攻击Wraith的命令代码
It's a command code
that directs them to attack the Wraith.

248
00:14:20,517 --> 00:14:22,146
但是它们没有攻击Wraith
But they don't attack the Wraith.

249
00:14:22,226 --> 00:14:25,192
他们在这儿已经10,000年了
They've been sitting on their nanite
asses for 10,000 years.

250
00:14:25,272 --> 00:14:26,860
那是因为它被解除激活了
That's because it's been deactivated.

251
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,831
- 为什么会那样呢
- 我也不清楚
- And how did that happen?
- I've no idea.

252
00:14:28,927 --> 00:14:31,684
也许是古人意识到无法控制它们才这么做的
Maybe the Ancients did it when
they realised they'd lost control.

253
00:14:31,782 --> 00:14:33,641
你现在才注意到?
You're just noticing this now, huh?

254
00:14:34,062 --> 00:14:37,454
这只是数百万基础代码命令中的一条
This is just one in millions
of commands in the base code.

255
00:14:37,534 --> 00:14:40,301
听着 我一直有预感可能会有这样的东西在那儿
Look, I always had a hunch that
something like this might be in there,

256
00:14:40,381 --> 00:14:42,203
但是相信我 并不是很容易就能找到的
but believe me, it was not easy to find.

257
00:14:42,456 --> 00:14:43,607
你能够重新激活它吗
Can you reactivate it?

258
00:14:43,703 --> 00:14:46,153
是的 但是有个问题
Yes, but there's a problem.

259
00:14:46,263 --> 00:14:48,175
听着 我可以重新
对你大脑里的纳米元件编程
Look, I can reprogram
the nanites in your brain

260
00:14:48,267 --> 00:14:50,110
然后通过那条连接
来上传改变的代码 但是...
and use that link
to upload the changes, but

261
00:14:50,221 --> 00:14:53,488
我们必须得等到下一次同步
才能同时影响所有的复制体
we'll need to wait for the next merge to
affect all the Replicators at once, and

262
00:14:53,644 --> 00:14:55,784
但我们还不知道
那会是什么时候 不仅如此
we have no idea when that could be.
Not only that, but

263
00:14:55,904 --> 00:14:57,886
这个过程开启的瞬间
它们就会知道你在那儿
the instant it happens,
they'll know you're there.

264
00:14:57,966 --> 00:14:59,851
就会马上来同化你
They'll take immediate
steps to assimilate you.

265
00:14:59,931 --> 00:15:01,502
那我们就不这么做
Then we're not doing it.

266
00:15:01,946 --> 00:15:04,298
John...你知道这意味着什么
John...
You know what this could mean.

267
00:15:04,748 --> 00:15:06,692
如果复制体和Wraith开战的话
If the Replicators go to war
with the Wraith?

268
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:08,402
忘掉这个想法吧 不会发生的
Forget about it. It's not happening.

269
00:15:08,482 --> 00:15:10,806
- 这不由你说了算
- 见鬼 不是又如何
- That's not your call.
- The hell it isn't!

270
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:13,736
别吵了 也许有另一个办法
Hang on. There may be another way.

271
00:15:13,876 --> 00:15:15,565
有一个中央数据核心
There's a central data core.

272
00:15:16,741 --> 00:15:20,780
对所有的复制体来说
它就像是个备份用的硬盘
It's kind of like a back-up
hard-drive for all the Replicators.

273
00:15:20,891 --> 00:15:23,910
如果可以把重新激活的攻击命令
直接上传到那里的话
If I can upload the reactivated
attack command directly into that,

274
00:15:24,063 --> 00:15:26,890
那样我们就不需要利用Elizabeth了
当下一次同步来临
we wouldn't need to use Elizabeth.
We could be half way back to Atlantis

275
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:29,131
攻击命令生效的时候
我们可能已经在回Atlantis的路上了
when the attack command
takes effect at the next merge.

276
00:15:29,317 --> 00:15:31,049
听上去我更喜欢这个主意
That sounds a little more like it.

277
00:15:31,266 --> 00:15:33,767
是的 还有一个小问题
There's one small problem,

278
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:36,452
实际上这并不是一个小问题
which is not actually a small problem.

279
00:15:36,532 --> 00:15:39,739
核心在城市的中心 很多层下面
The core is at the center of the city,
several levels down.

280
00:15:39,819 --> 00:15:42,079
想不被发觉到达那里是不可能的
It would be impossible
to get there undetected.

281
00:15:42,334 --> 00:15:43,334
好极了
Great.

282
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,530
等我们把ZPM带回Atlantis 把城市降落后
We're gonna have to come back
after we take the ZPM back to Atlantis

283
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,021
我们再回来
and after we land the City.

284
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,833
我认为我们不会再有第二次机会了
I don't think we'll have another chance.

285
00:15:49,929 --> 00:15:50,951
他说的对
He's right.

286
00:15:51,309 --> 00:15:52,998
一旦他们发现ZPM不见了
Once they notice the ZPM is missing,

287
00:15:53,096 --> 00:15:55,777
他们就能追踪到渗透的源头
they'll be able to trace
the source of the infiltration.

288
00:15:55,857 --> 00:15:58,618
我就再也无法进行这种不被发现的访问
I will never get this kind
of undetected access again.

289
00:15:58,935 --> 00:16:01,287
如果我们要干的话
就不能错过现在的机会
If we're gonna do this,
it's now or never.

290
00:16:04,887 --> 00:16:07,546
你要把隐身场改成反复制体场?
You're gonna turn the cloak
in an anti-Replicator field?

291
00:16:07,626 --> 00:16:09,631
是的 将A.R.G.的控制水晶
Yes, by interfacing
the A.R.G's control crystal

292
00:16:09,711 --> 00:16:11,458
与Jumper的隐身场发生器桥接
with the Jumper's cloaking generator.

293
00:16:11,538 --> 00:16:14,224
唯一的问题是场域能展开到多大
The only question is how far
I can widen the field.

294
00:16:14,414 --> 00:16:18,085
听着 起飞 尽可能到靠近城市中心的地方
Look, go ahead and fly us as close
to the center of the city as possible.

295
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:19,134
那儿
There.

296
00:16:19,214 --> 00:16:21,850
- 但是我们这样不就会被发现吗
- 是的 我们会被发现
- But won't we be visible?
- Yes, we will.

297
00:16:22,205 --> 00:16:23,984
反复制体场会保护我们
The anti-Replicator field
will protect us.

298
00:16:24,064 --> 00:16:26,520
假设我可以把场域展开足够大
That is, assuming that I can
extend the field wide enough

299
00:16:26,609 --> 00:16:29,359
不仅仅围绕Jumper 还包括核心室
to encompass not only the Jumper,
but also the core room, and

300
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:32,349
同时还假设 我们能够
足够快到达那里 输入命令
also assuming we can run fast enough
to get there, input the command, and

301
00:16:32,483 --> 00:16:36,374
然后能够赶回来
在复制体想出如何克服它之前 还有...
get back before the Replicators figure
out how to override the field, and...

302
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:37,933
你知道 屠杀我们之前
You know, slaughter us.

303
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,560
别担心 你不和我们一起去
Don't worry about it.
You're not coming with us.

304
00:16:40,777 --> 00:16:42,562
- Elizabeth也留下
- 抱歉 你说什么
- Neither is Elizabeth.
- I'm sorry, what?

305
00:16:42,642 --> 00:16:45,756
你们通过无线电指引我们 就像上次一样
You guys can guide us through
by radio like you did last time.

306
00:16:46,561 --> 00:16:49,785
等等 如果我不在那里
要如何输入命令
Wait a minute. If I'm not there, how are
we supposed to input the command?

307
00:16:49,887 --> 00:16:53,128
你把它写在平板电脑里
我把它插到核心上 然后上传
Put it on a tablet. I'll plug it
into the core and upload it myself.

308
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,481
插上然后按播放键 是么
什么 你觉得会那么简单吗
Oh, plug and play, huh?
What, you think it's that simple?

309
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:58,078
会的 因为你会想办法把它变得那么简单
Well, it will be, because
you're gonna make it that simple.

310
00:16:58,542 --> 00:16:59,913
- 是的...
- 我要你
- Yeah...
- I need you

311
00:17:00,329 --> 00:17:01,873
留在这里 Rodney
to stay here, Rodney.

312
00:17:02,084 --> 00:17:03,250
- 为什么
- Rodney
- Why?
- Rodney!

313
00:17:03,335 --> 00:17:04,793
为了盯着我
To keep an eye on me.

314
00:17:05,475 --> 00:17:07,677
你可能需要激活纳米元件的终止程序
You may need to activate
the kill switch on the nanites.

315
00:17:07,772 --> 00:17:11,170
如果我们都留在Jumper里的话
你就能够紧紧盯住我
You'll be able to keep a closer eye on
me if we both stay here in the Jumper.

316
00:17:15,748 --> 00:17:16,748
好吧
Alright.

317
00:17:17,501 --> 00:17:18,973
嘿 别碰那东西
Get out of that.

318
00:17:21,656 --> 00:17:24,849
- 核心就在那个平台下面
- 下面多远
- The core is beneath that platform.
- How far beneath?

319
00:17:25,922 --> 00:17:27,022
9层
Nine levels.

320
00:17:28,864 --> 00:17:29,943
小菜一碟
Piece of cake.

321
00:17:46,914 --> 00:17:49,087
- 有什么发现吗
- 没有
- Anything?
- No.

322
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,448
11次跳跃了
Eleven jumps.

323
00:17:53,399 --> 00:17:56,064
抱歉 即使扫描器的探测距离
得到了显著的提升
I'm sorry. Even with the scanners' range
significantly increased,

324
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:57,929
目前为止 我们也只完成了很小的区域
we've only covered a small area so far.

325
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:02,414
在到达起始的Lantian行星之前
我们还要再做39次跳跃
We still have 39 more jumps before
we reach the original Lantian planet.

326
00:18:02,525 --> 00:18:03,392
39?
Thirty nine?

327
00:18:04,849 --> 00:18:07,279
宇宙非常非常大
Space is quite vast.

328
00:18:09,228 --> 00:18:10,395
不用你说
You don't say.

329
00:18:13,482 --> 00:18:14,857
启动超空间引擎
Engage hyperdrive.

330
00:18:16,237 --> 00:18:17,637
第12次跳跃
Stop number twelve.

331
00:18:31,545 --> 00:18:35,282
- 我们现在能被看到
- 反复制体场现在启动
- We're visible.
- Engaging anti-Replicator field now.

332
00:18:46,186 --> 00:18:47,397
起作用了
It's working.

333
00:18:47,646 --> 00:18:51,057
好的 让我们把它扩大
看看能穿透多深
OK, let's jack it up,
see how far we can penetrate.

334
00:18:51,895 --> 00:18:52,895
穿透?
Penetrate?

335
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:54,399
怎么
What?

336
00:18:56,576 --> 00:18:58,059
好了 现在开始
Alright, here we go.

337
00:19:10,052 --> 00:19:12,165
- 起作用了
- 说得对 起作用了
- It's working.
- Damn right, it's working.

338
00:19:12,286 --> 00:19:14,775
已经包围了核心室 你们可以出发了
It's encompassed the core room.
You're good to go.

339
00:19:19,901 --> 00:19:22,123
怎么 你不相信我 却相信她?
What, you don't believe me,
but you believe her?

340
00:19:22,238 --> 00:19:23,349
我可没恶意
No offense.

341
00:19:24,134 --> 00:19:25,334
但我感觉到了
Offense taken.

342
00:19:25,859 --> 00:19:27,814
一直向下 走9层
Straight down, nine levels.

343
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,963
然后小跑一段走廊就到中心控制室了
Then a short run down a corridor
to the core room.

344
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:36,900
好了 我编写了一个简单的模块储存传输协议
OK, I've written a basic
block-storage transport protocol

345
00:19:37,007 --> 00:19:40,714
用以将攻击指令从这个平板电脑
直接上载到核心
to upload the attack command
directly from this tablet into the core.

346
00:19:40,884 --> 00:19:43,865
你要做的就是把这个插到主回路中
All you need to do is plug
this cable into the main circuit,

347
00:19:43,998 --> 00:19:46,660
然后它会自动设置并上载指令
it'll automatically configure
and upload the command.

348
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,828
插上插头
Plug it in.

349
00:19:48,203 --> 00:19:50,152
- 你想简单点的
- 我喜欢简单
- You wanted simple.
- I like simple.

350
00:19:50,595 --> 00:19:53,460
我们发明了这种适配器用以
Well, we created that adapter
to interface with Ancient tech,

351
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:57,348
和复制体喜欢模仿的古人科技进行交互
因此你们不会遇到什么问题
which the Replicators love to imitate,
so you shouldn't have a problem there.

352
00:19:57,459 --> 00:19:59,812
现在 你们动作一定要快
因为一旦他们发现了我们要做的事情
Now, you need to move fast,
because as soon as they find out

353
00:19:59,923 --> 00:20:02,427
就会想出解决的办法
what we're up to, they're going
to figure out a way around it.

354
00:20:02,507 --> 00:20:04,356
像上次那样做就可以了
Just do what you did last time.

355
00:20:04,957 --> 00:20:06,473
我们会很快回来的
We'll be back before you know it.

356
00:20:07,151 --> 00:20:08,151
我们走
Let's go.

357
00:20:28,016 --> 00:20:29,216
怎么了
What is it?

358
00:20:29,434 --> 00:20:32,437
在通讯塔的第2象限
发现反常的能量读数
An anomalous energy reading in the 2nd
quadrant of the communications tower.

359
00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:34,482
- 来源呢
- 还没能确定
- Source?
- Undetermined as of yet.

360
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:37,860
它在顶层建立了一个向下的分裂力场
It's creating a disruptive field,
emanating downwards from the top level,

361
00:20:37,993 --> 00:20:40,549
一直延伸到正下方的第9层
encompassing nine levels
directly below it.

362
00:20:40,897 --> 00:20:41,964
核心
The core.

363
00:20:43,322 --> 00:20:45,300
好了 我们到了 往左还是往右?
OK, we're here. Left or right?

364
00:20:45,637 --> 00:20:46,679
往左
Left.

365
00:20:58,779 --> 00:21:00,234
那个力场起作用了 Rodney
Shield's working, Rodney.

366
00:21:00,314 --> 00:21:03,520
- 好极了 记住要待在力场里面
- 谢谢提醒
- Good, make sure to stay behind it.
- Thanks for the tip.

367
00:21:04,182 --> 00:21:05,448
现在往右走
Now turn right.

368
00:21:25,137 --> 00:21:26,477
好的 我们到了
Alright, we're here.

369
00:21:26,597 --> 00:21:29,138
我估计那个大大的发光的东西就是核心
I'm assuming the big
glowy thing is the core.

370
00:21:30,005 --> 00:21:32,074
是的 就是那个 好了在控制台上
Indeed, it is. OK,
there should be an open slot

371
00:21:32,194 --> 00:21:34,352
应该有一个可以让你插电缆的接口
in the control panel
that you can plug the cable into.

372
00:21:35,933 --> 00:21:37,023
好的
Alright.

373
00:21:40,597 --> 00:21:41,643
开始
Here goes.

374
00:21:45,163 --> 00:21:46,263
插进去了
It's plugged in.

375
00:21:46,383 --> 00:21:47,372
是吗
It is?

376
00:21:47,695 --> 00:21:51,035
我怎么什么都没看到
你确定你插进了正确的接口吗
Why am I not reading anything? Are you
sure you plugged it into the right slot?

377
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,205
这里只有一个接口 Rodney
There's only one slot, Rodney.

378
00:21:55,311 --> 00:21:58,222
快点 John 他们来了 有几百个
Hurry, John, they're coming,
and there's hundreds of them.

379
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:02,504
- 力场不是会保护我们的吗
- 只要你动作够快
- Won't the field protect us?
- As long as you hurry.

380
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,591
好的 听着 试试拔出来再重新插一次
OK, look, try plugging it in again.

381
00:22:08,176 --> 00:22:09,970
好了 重新插进去了
Alright, it's plugged in again.

382
00:22:11,765 --> 00:22:13,662
还是没反应 你做了什么
Still nothing. What did you do?

383
00:22:13,782 --> 00:22:15,025
我什么都没做
I didn't do anything.

384
00:22:22,439 --> 00:22:24,109
他们在不断攻击力场
They keep attacking the field.

385
00:22:24,907 --> 00:22:27,029
他们故意牺牲自己
They're deliberately
sacrificing themselves.

386
00:22:27,268 --> 00:22:28,447
他们为什么要那么做
Why would they do that?

387
00:22:29,584 --> 00:22:30,783
他们攻击力场的次数越多
The more they attack the field,

388
00:22:30,865 --> 00:22:33,452
就能越快找出穿过力场的方法
the quicker they can figure out
how to override it.

389
00:22:33,611 --> 00:22:35,483
那我们得赶快离开这儿了
Then we need to get the hell ot of here.

390
00:22:35,603 --> 00:22:37,124
Rodney 为什么会不起作用
Rodney, why is this not working?

391
00:22:37,428 --> 00:22:40,213
不起作用是因为核心
无法识别平板电脑
It's not working because
the core is not recognizing the tablet.

392
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:41,440
好的 为什么不行
Why not?

393
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,841
听着 我不知道
I don't know!

394
00:22:49,631 --> 00:22:51,658
- 我们几乎就要穿越力场了
- 好的
- We're almost through the field.
- Good.

395
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:52,988
我去了
I'm on my way.

396
00:22:55,378 --> 00:22:58,074
好吧 你需要将对话协议进行调整
You need to implement
adjustments in the negotiation protocol

397
00:22:58,154 --> 00:23:00,520
使装置交互能够并行
to exploit parallelism
at the device interface.

398
00:23:01,236 --> 00:23:02,934
- 什么
- 只管照我说的做
- What?
- Just do what I say.

399
00:23:03,054 --> 00:23:06,597
先拔出插头 现在进入平板电脑的根目录
Start by unplugging the cable.
Access the tablet's root directory.

400
00:23:07,434 --> 00:23:08,903
这可不简单了
This is not simple.

401
00:23:18,762 --> 00:23:20,974
- 你得马上让他们出来
- 我们还没完成
- You have to get them out of there.
- We're not done...

402
00:23:21,054 --> 00:23:24,100
已经没有时间了
复制体已经突破力场了
There's no more time!
The Replicators have breached the field!

403
00:23:27,094 --> 00:23:28,881
你说他们突破立场了是什么意思
What do you mean
they breached the field?

404
00:23:29,001 --> 00:23:32,044
他们找到了穿越它的方法
听着 我们的动作还要再快些
They figured how to override it.
Look, we need to move much faster.

405
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,322
你得做些改动使对话协议
You need to make changes
to the negotiation protocol

406
00:23:34,442 --> 00:23:36,491
允许直接的数据安置
to allow for direct data placement.

407
00:23:36,611 --> 00:23:39,119
我们需要考虑到数据流中数据包边界
We need to allow for resynchronization
of the packet boundaries

408
00:23:39,239 --> 00:23:40,724
的重新同步
within the data stream.

409
00:23:40,844 --> 00:23:42,924
Oberoth往核心室去了
Oberoth is heading to the core room.

410
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:45,063
- 他知道是我们
- 有多远
- He knows it's us.
- How far is he?

411
00:23:45,145 --> 00:23:46,693
- 他们能逃掉吗
- 不行
- Can they make a run for it?
- No.

412
00:23:46,773 --> 00:23:49,458
复制体正从四面八方围上来
他们被困住了
Replicators are apoaching
from every direction. They're trapped.

413
00:23:49,538 --> 00:23:51,359
也就是说他们等于是挂了
Which means they're as good as dead.

414
00:23:51,683 --> 00:23:53,216
要知道我们能听到你说话
We can hear you, you know.

415
00:23:53,336 --> 00:23:54,508
什么 噢 不
What? No.

416
00:23:54,628 --> 00:23:57,275
我说等于是挂了
其实意思更倾向于...
When I say, "as good as dead,"
I mean it as more of a...

417
00:23:57,395 --> 00:23:59,355
- Elizabeth 你要干嘛
- 呆在这儿
- Elizabeth, what are you doing?
- Stay here!

418
00:23:59,475 --> 00:24:01,224
Elizabeth 你不能出去
Elizabeth, you can't go out there!

419
00:24:01,344 --> 00:24:02,808
- Elizabeth
- 发生什么事了 Rodney
- Elizabeth!
- What's going on?

420
00:24:02,904 --> 00:24:05,039
- Elizabeth刚刚离开了Jumper
- 为什么
- Elizabeth just left the jumper.
- Why?

421
00:24:05,231 --> 00:24:07,090
我不知道 她就这么跑出去了
I don't know. She just ran out.

422
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:09,605
Elizabeth 我是Sheppard
你能听到吗
Elizabeth, this is Sheppard,
do you copy?

423
00:24:13,107 --> 00:24:14,132
请回答
Respond.

424
00:24:14,738 --> 00:24:17,030
- 如果他们抓到她
- 我知道 我知道
- If they capture her...
- I know, I know.

425
00:24:17,273 --> 00:24:18,743
那么 我们现在怎么办
So, what do we do now?

426
00:24:20,029 --> 00:24:23,267
她说过如果她有可疑的举动
就打开纳米元件的终止开关
She said to hit the kill switch on the
nanites if she did anything suspicious.

427
00:24:24,217 --> 00:24:25,217
我知道 但是...
I know, but...

428
00:24:29,318 --> 00:24:30,128
Sheppard...
Sheppard.

429
00:24:32,581 --> 00:24:33,901
下命令吧
Make the call.

430
00:24:36,414 --> 00:24:37,416
动手吧
Do it.

431
00:24:48,663 --> 00:24:50,982
- 它不起作用了
- 什么
- It's not working.
- What?

432
00:24:51,102 --> 00:24:53,746
- 为什么不起作用
- 给我点儿时间
- Why not?
- Just... give me a second.

433
00:24:56,438 --> 00:25:00,485
我没得到信息确认 还有 别再问为什么
因为我不知道 好么
I'm not getting confirmation, and don't
ask why, because I don't know, OK?

434
00:25:00,578 --> 00:25:02,492
我的意思是 上一次
她体内有活跃纳米元件时
The last time she had
active nanites inside her,

435
00:25:02,612 --> 00:25:05,875
她能够施加一定程度的控制
也许 也许她现在正在那么做
she was able to exert a certain control.
Maybe she's doing it here now, or...

436
00:25:05,955 --> 00:25:08,251
又或者有干扰影响了频率
maybe there's interference
that's affecting the frequency.

437
00:25:08,331 --> 00:25:10,991
我不知道 我得运行诊断程序
I don't know.
I need to run a diagnostic.

438
00:25:11,111 --> 00:25:13,774
你为什么不想个方法
把我们弄出去呢
Better yet, why don't you figure out
a way how to get us out here?

439
00:25:14,383 --> 00:25:17,255
即使我们完了 也要把任务完成了
If we're screwed, we might
as well complete the mission.

440
00:25:33,037 --> 00:25:34,084
Weir博士?
Dr. Weir?

441
00:25:34,692 --> 00:25:35,872
你好 Oberoth
Hello, Oberoth.

442
00:25:37,084 --> 00:25:38,376
你很吃惊
You're surprised.

443
00:25:38,565 --> 00:25:39,656
是的 我是很惊讶
Indeed, I am.

444
00:25:41,026 --> 00:25:42,918
Niam用纳米元件感染了我
Niam infected me with nanites.

445
00:25:43,849 --> 00:25:45,647
是的 我发觉了
Yes, I can detect them now.

446
00:25:45,767 --> 00:25:47,455
我们把它们中和了
We were able to neutralize them,

447
00:25:48,376 --> 00:25:49,712
并重行编程
and then reprogram

448
00:25:50,754 --> 00:25:53,230
为我们所用
and manipulate them to suit our needs.

449
00:25:54,371 --> 00:25:55,649
你们真勤奋
Industrious of you.

450
00:25:55,888 --> 00:26:00,009
这也就是为什么我能通过你
建立一个物理链接
Which is why, now that I've been able to
establish a physical link through you,

451
00:26:01,784 --> 00:26:04,945
我直接进入了全部复制体
I have direct access
to the Replicator collective.

452
00:26:07,689 --> 00:26:09,114
现在全由我掌控了
I'm in control now.

453
00:26:14,414 --> 00:26:15,877
好了 我插进去了 怎么样
OK, I'm plugged in. Anything?

454
00:26:20,098 --> 00:26:22,175
好了 好了 起作用了
Yes! Yes, it's working!

455
00:26:38,858 --> 00:26:40,610
发生了什么事
What the hell just happened?

456
00:26:42,794 --> 00:26:44,553
复制体都不动了
The Replicators have all frozen.

457
00:26:44,673 --> 00:26:47,200
是的 我看得见 但是谁做的呢
Well, I can see that, but who did it?

458
00:26:47,421 --> 00:26:48,667
不是我
It wasn't me.

459
00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:50,596
应该是Elizabeth
It might have been Elizabeth.

460
00:26:50,687 --> 00:26:52,553
- 她能做到吗
- 我不知道 我是说
- Can she do that?
- I don't know. I mean,

461
00:26:52,666 --> 00:26:55,498
她必须与全部复制体进行直接链接
也就是说
she'd have to link directly
with the collective, which means the

462
00:26:55,578 --> 00:26:58,990
他们控制她的纳米元件的可能性
成几何级数地增长
chances they'll be able to take over her
nanites have increased exponentially.

463
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,919
他们活过来要多少时间
How long before they come back to life?

464
00:27:00,999 --> 00:27:03,798
我也想问这个问题 但我更愿意相信
Your guess is as good as mine,
but I would err on the side of less time

465
00:27:03,878 --> 00:27:05,802
- 时间不多了
- 我们能走了吗
- rather than more.
- So we go?

466
00:27:06,164 --> 00:27:08,555
是的 先把重要的事做了 上载如何了
Yeah, first things first. How are we
doing with the upload?

467
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:11,537
就要好了 还要几秒钟
Almost there. Just a few more seconds.

468
00:27:11,657 --> 00:27:14,358
- 多少秒
- 别再这么问我了
- How many seconds?
Don't start with that again!

469
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:19,254
你的力量让我印象深刻
I'm impressed with your strength,

470
00:27:20,164 --> 00:27:23,075
Weir博士 但我必须提醒你
我进行必要的修整
Dr. Weir, but I must remind you,
that it's only a matter of time

471
00:27:23,588 --> 00:27:26,200
并摆脱你的控制
before I make the necessary corrections

472
00:27:26,309 --> 00:27:28,820
只是个时间问题
to overcome the hold you have on me.

473
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:31,494
我做好了一直斗下去的准备
I am prepared to fight
for as long as I need.

474
00:27:32,171 --> 00:27:33,261
很伟大
Good for you.

475
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:37,315
你保护自己人的愿望值得赞赏
Your desire to protect
your people is admirable,

476
00:27:38,775 --> 00:27:40,388
但最终 你会
but you will, ultimately,

477
00:27:41,313 --> 00:27:42,110
失败的
fail.

478
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,436
继续那么想吧
Keep thinking that.

479
00:27:44,473 --> 00:27:47,009
继续让你的高傲埋葬自己吧
Keep allowing your arrogance
to undermine you.

480
00:27:47,226 --> 00:27:49,453
你知道这是事实 Weir博士
You know it's true, Dr. Weir.

481
00:27:52,197 --> 00:27:54,089
我能感受到你已经开始变弱了
I can feel you weakening already.

482
00:27:57,468 --> 00:27:58,714
即便有斗争的欲望
Despite your desire

483
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:02,000
但这对你来说...
this is a fight for which you are...

484
00:28:02,423 --> 00:28:03,476
很明显是一场
clearly

485
00:28:03,887 --> 00:28:05,152
缺乏准备的战斗
ill-equipped.

486
00:28:05,232 --> 00:28:06,821
好了 完成了 拔下插头快走
That's it, you're done! Unplug and go!

487
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:28,026
再说一遍
Once again,

488
00:28:28,562 --> 00:28:30,298
你低估了我
you have underestimated me.

489
00:28:37,733 --> 00:28:39,270
他们又开始动了
They're moving again!

490
00:28:42,366 --> 00:28:44,401
是的 我知道
Yeah. I know.

491
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,011
好吧
Well,

492
00:29:16,449 --> 00:29:17,643
这真是熟悉的场景
this is familiar.

493
00:29:17,993 --> 00:29:20,371
我正在想你们的这次入侵
I'm trying to decide
if this incursion of yours

494
00:29:20,481 --> 00:29:22,939
表现了你们出奇的勇敢 还是...
reflects considerable bravery or

495
00:29:23,019 --> 00:29:24,941
- 愚蠢
- Weir博士在哪儿
- stupidity.
- Where's Dr. Weir?

496
00:29:25,779 --> 00:29:27,665
想要对我们全体进行控制的尝试
Her attempts to seize
control of the collective

497
00:29:27,775 --> 00:29:29,780
使她不堪重负
proved too taxing for her,

498
00:29:30,126 --> 00:29:33,051
她的生理与心理均陷于濒死的境地
rendering her mind and body
virtually moribund.

499
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:35,224
她已经被带去...
She has been taken to be...

500
00:29:35,539 --> 00:29:36,769
修理了
repaired.

501
00:29:37,028 --> 00:29:39,980
- 你们想要控制她
- 我们已经做到了
- You're gonna take control of her.
- That has already occurred.

502
00:29:41,192 --> 00:29:43,293
不幸的是 我没法
Unfortunately, I was not able to

503
00:29:43,373 --> 00:29:46,099
从她那里收集我想要的所有信息
glean all the information
I need from her,

504
00:29:46,236 --> 00:29:48,506
所以我不得不从你们身上拿
so I will have to extract it from you.

505
00:29:48,805 --> 00:29:50,144
信息?
Information?

506
00:29:50,267 --> 00:29:52,302
有关Atlantis的精确位置
About the precise location of Atlantis.

507
00:29:52,705 --> 00:29:55,305
在我们摧毁它之前
你们逃离了那个星球
You left your planet before
we were able to destroy it.

508
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:57,543
对毁了你们的计划深表遗憾
Sorry to spoil your plans.

509
00:29:57,653 --> 00:29:59,116
没什么被毁
Nothing is spoiled,

510
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,463
只是被延长了
merely prolonged,

511
00:30:01,791 --> 00:30:03,280
而现在 由于你们的帮助
and now, with your help,

512
00:30:03,431 --> 00:30:05,190
我们将完成对它的毁灭
we will complete the destruction.

513
00:30:06,168 --> 00:30:09,194
你看 我们当中没人会主动告诉你信息...
Seeing how none of us
will volunteer the information...

514
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:11,786
你清楚地知道
You know quite well

515
00:30:12,154 --> 00:30:15,257
我们有一个简单的方法
来获取我们需要的信息
that we have a simple method
for extracting what we need.

516
00:30:44,392 --> 00:30:45,526
有问题吗
Problems?

517
00:31:05,579 --> 00:31:06,626
什么
What?

518
00:31:06,763 --> 00:31:09,086
我知道 你会摆弄我们的思想
I figured, you'd messed with our minds,

519
00:31:09,988 --> 00:31:11,714
所以我扰乱了你的思想
so I'd mess with yours.

520
00:31:12,134 --> 00:31:14,335
你并不比我强大 Oberoth
You didn't overpower me, Oberoth.

521
00:31:14,704 --> 00:31:17,533
复制体守卫并没有抓住我的小队
The Replicator guards
didn't capture my team.

522
00:31:19,718 --> 00:31:22,889
那些只是在你脑中虚构的场景
It was all a fictional scenario
played out in your mind.

523
00:31:23,928 --> 00:31:26,074
现实中 你的守卫还被冻结着
In reality,
your guards are still frozen,

524
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:29,505
而我的小队在我们说话的当口逃跑了
and my team is escaping as we speak.

525
00:31:30,729 --> 00:31:32,389
你错了 Oberoth
You were wrong, Oberoth.

526
00:31:33,127 --> 00:31:35,328
我从来都没有低估你
I have never underestimated you,

527
00:31:36,804 --> 00:31:39,283
但你明显低估了我
but you have clearly underestimated me.

528
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:41,861
你不会活着离开这座城市的
You will not leave this city alive!

529
00:31:41,998 --> 00:31:43,078
也许不会
Maybe not,

530
00:31:44,509 --> 00:31:46,081
但我的队伍会
but my team will.

531
00:31:46,662 --> 00:31:48,692
- 还是没有Elizabeth的消息么
- 没有
- Still nothing from Elizabeth?
- No.

532
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:52,033
我联系不到她 追踪不到她
好像她就...就这么消失了
Can't communicate with her or track her.
It's like she just... disappeared.

533
00:31:52,115 --> 00:31:53,878
如果是她让复制体无法活动的
If she's the one
who froze the Replicators,

534
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,771
那就是说 她很可能还活着
that means she's probably still alive.

535
00:31:55,853 --> 00:31:57,377
目前来看 是有可能
For the moment, maybe.

536
00:31:57,473 --> 00:31:59,211
- 她离这儿不会太远的
- 我们会找到她的
- She can't be that far.
- We'll find her.

537
00:31:59,454 --> 00:32:02,420
好吧 你们最好快点
那些复制体随时都有可能解冻
You better make it fast. The Replicators
could unfreeze at any moment.

538
00:32:02,516 --> 00:32:03,978
谢谢 Rodney
Thanks, Rodney!

539
00:32:06,451 --> 00:32:08,365
我很欣赏你的坚韧
I admire your tenacity,

540
00:32:09,718 --> 00:32:11,273
但我不会被愚弄第二次
but I won't be fooled again.

541
00:32:18,546 --> 00:32:20,760
你在挣扎 Weir博士
You're struggling, Dr. Weir.

542
00:32:41,374 --> 00:32:42,804
快去Jumper
Get to the jumper!

543
00:32:43,274 --> 00:32:44,764
你得和我们一起走
You're coming with us.

544
00:32:45,428 --> 00:32:48,018
我没法再让他们冰冻下去了
I can't keep them frozen much longer!

545
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,312
我们不会抛下你的
We're not leaving you behind!

546
00:32:50,392 --> 00:32:52,006
如果你们现在不走
If you don't leave right now,

547
00:32:52,115 --> 00:32:53,946
那我们就没人能逃出去了 所以快走
none of us will get out of here, so go!

548
00:32:54,056 --> 00:32:55,567
这是命令
That's an order!

549
00:32:57,065 --> 00:32:58,700
- 走吧
- Elizabeth
Come on!

550
00:32:58,803 --> 00:32:59,738
快走
Go!

551
00:33:04,094 --> 00:33:05,118
哦 谢天谢地
Oh, thank God.

552
00:33:10,272 --> 00:33:11,856
我们能隐身么
Can we cloak?

553
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:14,932
Rodney 我们能隐身么
Rodney, can we cloak?

554
00:33:16,104 --> 00:33:17,063
不 还不行
No, Not yet.

555
00:33:17,145 --> 00:33:20,216
不行 把隐身转换为AR场耗费了太多的能量
We drained too much power trying
to convert the cloak into an AR field.

556
00:33:20,296 --> 00:33:22,968
听着 我正尝试接驳ZPM 但需要些时间
I'll try to interface the ZPM,
but we're going to need some time.

557
00:33:24,063 --> 00:33:26,482
好吧 我们尽量争取时间
Alright, we'll just have
to make a run for it then.

558
00:33:35,277 --> 00:33:36,566
超空间引擎怎么样
How's hyperspace looking?

559
00:33:37,027 --> 00:33:39,502
不怎么样 要知道
从ZPM中汲取能量很需要技巧
Not good. Harnessing power
from the ZPM is tricky.

560
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,288
如果我错了哪怕一丁点儿数量 那么
If I'm off even
a slightest amount, then

561
00:33:41,384 --> 00:33:43,239
- 我们都会...
- 有两艘飞船正往这来
- we could all...
- Two ships heading our way.

562
00:33:46,074 --> 00:33:48,835
- Rodney
- 我需要再多一点时间
- Rodney!
- I need more time!

563
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,623
我们刚刚失去了武器系统
We just lost weapons!

564
00:33:52,703 --> 00:33:54,005
- 可恶
- 快点 Mckay
- Dammit!
- Come on, McKay!

565
00:33:54,092 --> 00:33:55,518
这可不简单 你知道吗
This is not simple, you know?

566
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,648
如果我不正确校准能量输出 那我们可能
If I don't properly calibrate the power
output, we could incinerate the moment

567
00:33:58,743 --> 00:34:00,233
在超空间窗口打开的那一刹那就烧成灰烬
the hyperspace window opens!

568
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:04,635
我们正前方有什么东西
I'm picking something up dead ahead.

569
00:34:15,226 --> 00:34:16,428
噢 该死
Oh, crap.

570
00:34:17,978 --> 00:34:19,639
他们在给武器补充能量
They're powering up weapons!

571
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:28,951
那是什么
What the hell was that?

572
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,273
Sheppard中校 这里是Apollo号
你听到了吗
Colonel Sheppard, this is the Apollo,
do you read?

573
00:34:36,369 --> 00:34:37,960
Ellis上校 是你吗
Colonel Ellis, is that you?

574
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,950
是的 302号堤岸已经开启
Affirmative. The 302 bay is open,

575
00:34:40,046 --> 00:34:42,957
你们可以登陆 我建议你们尽快
and you have permission to come aboard.
I suggest you hurry.

576
00:34:43,094 --> 00:34:45,217
收到 Apollo号 我们这就去
Copy that, Apollo. We're on our way.

577
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:48,192
我能不能补充一句
你们这时间算的真他妈完美
Can I just add that your timing
is pretty damn perfect?

578
00:34:48,302 --> 00:34:51,650
我们原本能早些到这儿的
但我们寻找Atlantis时出了点小麻烦
We would've got here earlier, but we had
a little trouble finding Atlantis.

579
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:54,768
Sam? 等等 是你吗


Wait, is that you?

580
00:34:55,231 --> 00:34:57,646
是我 Rodney
你上船后我会向你解释
It's me, Rodney.
I'll explain when you get onboard.

581
00:34:57,842 --> 00:34:58,927
上校...
Colonel...

582
00:34:59,267 --> 00:35:02,317
Weir博士被困在复制体星球上 你们能...
We lost Dr. Weir
on the Replicator planet. Can you...

583
00:35:02,739 --> 00:35:05,172
锁定她的定位器信标把她光传上来吗
lock on her locator beacon
and beam her up?

584
00:35:07,878 --> 00:35:09,658
我没获得任何信号
I'm not picking up any signal.

585
00:35:13,291 --> 00:35:14,562
收到
Copy that.

586
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:33,747
这里有个不错的 M35-117
Here's a good one, M35-117.

587
00:35:33,993 --> 00:35:36,911
- Weir博士知道吗
- 不 这不在我们的首选和后备列表上
- Does Dr. Weir know about it?
- Not on our primary or back-up list.

588
00:35:37,006 --> 00:35:39,589
我着意地选择了一个
我们以前没考虑过的星球
I purposefully searched for a planet
we'd never considered before.

589
00:35:39,671 --> 00:35:42,926
复制体可以在她的脑中
探测想要的信息 但不会发现这个
The Replicators can probe her mind
all they want, they won't find it.

590
00:35:43,022 --> 00:35:44,169
很好...
Good...

591
00:35:44,547 --> 00:35:47,179
- 对我们而言
- 好了 听着 那里...
- For us.
- Well, look, it's a...

592
00:35:47,302 --> 00:35:49,803
有稳定的大气 一片巨大的海洋
stable atmosphere, a big ocean.

593
00:35:49,899 --> 00:35:51,908
有些不仅很大 而且
Besides the large, particularly

594
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:54,420
很像毒蛇的生物在大陆栖息
venomous snake-like creature
that inhabits the main land,

595
00:35:54,532 --> 00:35:56,581
看来是个很好客的环境
it looks to be a welcoming environment.

596
00:35:58,547 --> 00:36:00,749
好的 Radek 进度怎么样
Alright. Radek, how we doing?

597
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:03,387
全设定好了 ZPM已经接入系统
All set here. The ZPM is online.

598
00:36:03,674 --> 00:36:04,753
好了
OK,

599
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,448
我们开始吧
here we go.

600
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:27,092
我们做到了
We did it.

601
00:36:28,317 --> 00:36:30,822
好了 让这个城市降落还有些小问题
Well, there's still the small matter
of landing this thing.

602
00:36:31,543 --> 00:36:33,730
我会跳上控制椅 慢慢地把我们降下去
I'll just jump in the chair,
ease us down.

603
00:36:33,907 --> 00:36:35,368
好吧 那可是很有技术性的
Well, that could be tricky.

604
00:36:35,448 --> 00:36:37,789
我们光到这儿就消耗了ZPM很多能量
We drained a lot of power
from the ZPM just getting here.

605
00:36:37,898 --> 00:36:40,257
我们有足够的能量确保
护盾能够支持我们再入
We got enough energy to keep
the shield up for re-entry.

606
00:36:40,345 --> 00:36:43,031
最好是那样 一个如此大的城市
会产生可观的摩擦热量
There better be. A City this size
will create considerable friction.

607
00:36:43,127 --> 00:36:45,228
如果我们进入得太快
角度太倾斜 护盾就会...
We come in too fast
or too steep, and the shield

608
00:36:45,324 --> 00:36:48,330
在压力作用下减弱
那么整个城市就会分崩离析
could attenuate under the stress,
the whole place will be torn to shreds

609
00:36:48,453 --> 00:36:49,966
或被烧毁 也可能两者都有
or burn up, or both...

610
00:36:50,406 --> 00:36:52,093
要知道 你总是不知道停下
It never ends with you, you know?

611
00:36:52,552 --> 00:36:53,386
什么
What?

612
00:36:53,495 --> 00:36:55,763
让所有人都系上安全带 我们要着陆了
Tell everyone to buckle up.
We're going in.

613
00:37:14,879 --> 00:37:16,620
护盾维持中 目前为止很好
Shield's holding. So far so good.

614
00:37:17,265 --> 00:37:19,569
- 出什么问题了
- 倾角太大了
- What's wrong?
- Angle's too steep.

615
00:37:19,678 --> 00:37:21,927
如果继续这样 会造成护盾太多的拉伸应变
Like this, we're gonna put
too much strain on the shield,

616
00:37:22,009 --> 00:37:24,195
也就是说要从ZPM汲取更多的能量
which means more power draining
from the ZPM.

617
00:37:24,305 --> 00:37:25,986
Sheppard 倾角太大了
Sheppard, we're coming in too steep.

618
00:37:26,082 --> 00:37:28,045
我们要减小再入的角度
We need to ease up
on the angle of re-entry.

619
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:31,576
事实上 应该是进入
你看 我们从来没有离开过这里...
In fact, you mean entry.
You see, we never actually left this...

620
00:37:31,921 --> 00:37:33,217
噢 好的 好的
Right, right.

621
00:37:39,452 --> 00:37:40,969
减小角度
Ease up on the angle!

622
00:37:41,707 --> 00:37:43,561
你第一次说的时候我就听到了 Rodney
I heard you the first time, Rodney.

623
00:37:43,934 --> 00:37:45,813
但我们的角度还是太大了
And yet we're still coming in too steep!

624
00:37:50,878 --> 00:37:52,093
抓紧
Hang on!

625
00:37:59,053 --> 00:38:00,577
我们要到达海洋了
We're over the ocean!

626
00:38:00,816 --> 00:38:03,706
Sheppard 你得把速度慢下来
我们要进入水中了
Sheppard you need to slow us down.
We're coming in over the water.

627
00:38:03,973 --> 00:38:05,135
收到
Copy that.

628
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,410
还是太快 减速
Still too fast! Slow down!

629
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,385
我们要缓缓降落
We want to touch down gently, like

630
00:38:16,993 --> 00:38:19,303
就像叶子轻触池塘的水面
like a leaf kissing
the surface of a pond.

631
00:38:39,737 --> 00:38:41,201
不错的轻触
Nice kissing.

632
00:38:47,954 --> 00:38:48,959
情况怎么样
How we doing?

633
00:38:51,053 --> 00:38:52,462
系统看起来不错...
Systems are looking good...

634
00:38:52,542 --> 00:38:53,653
到目前为止
So far,

635
00:38:53,787 --> 00:38:55,482
ZPM也有充足的能量
and plenty of power in the ZPM.

636
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:58,078
解除护盾
Drop the shield.

637
00:39:02,944 --> 00:39:04,707
Sheppard中校 我们成功了
Colonel Sheppard, we made it.

638
00:39:04,802 --> 00:39:07,140
城市安全地漂浮在海面上
The City's floating safely on the ocean.

639
00:39:07,618 --> 00:39:08,957
出色的降落
Excellent landing.

640
00:39:10,392 --> 00:39:11,592
谢谢
Thank you.

641
00:39:47,609 --> 00:39:49,310
你觉得谁会来代替她
Who d'you think's gonna replace her?

642
00:39:52,926 --> 00:39:54,183
我不知道
I don't know.

643
00:39:57,655 --> 00:39:58,926
无论是谁...
Whoever it is...

644
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:01,823
这都是个苦差事
That's tough shoes to fill.

645
00:40:06,607 --> 00:40:07,745
是的
Yes.

646
00:40:21,533 --> 00:40:23,807
- 好了 让我们试试看
- 好的
- OK, let's give it a go.
- Right.

647
00:40:38,056 --> 00:40:40,598
这里是Atlantis 呼叫星门指挥部
This is Atlantis,
calling Stargate Command.

648
00:40:40,707 --> 00:40:41,937
