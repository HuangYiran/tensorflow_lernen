00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,260
上世纪八十年代 汽车可以穿越时空
Back in the '80s, you had cars that could travel through time, 

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:06,790
可以抓鬼 还能与大卫・赫索霍夫交流
cars that caught ghosts, and cars that could talk to David Hasselhoff. 

3
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:06,790
{\an8}大卫・赫索霍夫 出生於美国巴蒂摩尔的德国裔演员 代表作有《霹雳游侠》

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,680
所以当我哥巴里拿到驾照那一刻
So when my Brother Barry got his license...

5
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:13,820
他终于自由了
He was finally free!

6
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,710
不幸的是 有我妈在
Unfortunately, with my mom, 

7
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:41,460
你休想自由
you're never free.

8
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:43,890
回屋里去 现在就去
Tush inside. Now.

9
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,040
真见鬼啊
What the hell?

10
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,890
你特意坐在后面等着我吗
Are you just sitting back there waiting for me?

11
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,090
是啊 快去
Yes. Tush!

12
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,580
守则七
Rule number seven...

13
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,580
全神贯注于路况
Total focus on the road.

14
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:54,670
不许吃 不许载人 不许听音乐
No eating, no passengers, no music.

15
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,070
- 啥 - 不许听音乐
- What? - No music.

16
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,250
守则八
Rule number eight...

17
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,480
门必须锁好 窗户得一直关着
Doors must be locked and windows rolled up at all times.

18
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:02,750
- 一直哦 - 疯了吧
- All times. - That's insane!

19
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,810
我们接着说守则九 你只能在安全区域驾驶
Which brings us to number nine-- you only drive in safe areas.

20
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,470
就是说
That means...

21
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,230
乖乖呆在绿色区域
Stay within the green zone.

22
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,300
你还弄了个塑料封皮的地图
You got a map with plastic overlays?

23
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,260
谁那么有才啊
Who does that?

24
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,110
我
I do.

25
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,020
守则十
And rule number ten,

26
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,260
最重要的一条
and this is the most important rule...

27
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,230
到达目的地记得给我打电话
Call me when you get there.

28
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,950
永远记得到了后给我打电话
Always call me when you get there.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,370
为嘛我到了要给你打电话啊
Why do I have to call you when I get there?

30
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,010
到了就是到了 我知道我到了
I'm there. I know I'm there.

31
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,110
但我不知道啊 我只知道
But I don't know. For all I know,

32
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,600
你可能会在荒郊野外出事故
you could be stranded in the middle of nowhere,

33
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:34,010
面朝下躺在小沟沟里
lying facedown in a ditch.

34
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,490
洗碗去 见鬼
Do the dishes, damn it!

35
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,010
是小沟沟好吧
Ditches, okay?!

36
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,300
你不能就这么盲目同意她
You're just blindly agreeing with her

37
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,520
却根本不知道她在说什么
and have no idea what she's even talking about.

38
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,850
我知道她在说什么
I know what she's talking about.

39
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,310
就这些 好好学习各州首府
Right there. Learn your state capitals.

40
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,150
但是你的学习态度太高傲了
But you're too much of a big shot to study.

41
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,480
我告诉你吧 先生
Let me tell you somethin', mister.

42
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,200
不久就要进大学了
College is right around the corner,

43
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:55,600
你要么好好努力 要么滚蛋
and you need to shape up or ship out.

44
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,330
我们正在说她愚蠢的驾驶守则呢 爸爸
We're talking about her stupid driving rules, dad.

45
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,630
这件事上你就不能支持下我吗 就一次 求你了
Can you stick up for me here? For once? Please?

46
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,940
有史以来
And for the first time,

47
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,910
我爸真就站在了我哥这边
my father actually took my brother's side.

48
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,090
没门
No.

49
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:10,080
没 从未发生
No, wait. That never happened.

50
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,520
这个家的糟糕程度
The amount of suck 

51
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,030
简直让人不敢相信
in this room is unreal!

52
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,330
我要去看电影了
I'm going to the movies.

53
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,980
到了给我打电话哦
Call me when you get there!

54
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:19,950
但是打破规则
But out of principle,

55
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,660
巴里到那儿后并没有打电话
Barry did no call when he got there

56
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,240
因为他知道
because he knew that out in the world,

57
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:24,940
天高皇帝远
he was beyond my mother's reach.

58
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,800
巴里・戈德堡
Barry Goldberg?

59
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:30,130
这儿有谁叫巴里・戈德堡吗
Is there a Barry Goldberg here?

60
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,070
巴里・戈德堡
Barry Goldberg?

61
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,150
怎么了
Um, yeah?

62
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,000
你需要给你妈个电话
You need to call your mother

63
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,800
告诉她你安全到达这儿了
and tell her you arrived here safely.

64
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,990
她非常担心 伙计 这样不好啊
She's very worried, dude. Not cool.

65
00:02:45,189 --> 00:02:49,908
金色年代 第一季07集


66
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,060
那是一九八几年的十月十八号
It was october 18th, 1980-something,

67
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,430
我和我姐正在看
and my sister and I were watching

68
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,920
有生以来见过的最有意思的事
the most entertaining thing we'd ever seen...

69
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,280
我爸爸正试着搞定录像机
My dad trying to work the VCR.

70
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:09,470
每次结局都是这样的
Every time it ended like this.

71
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,210
这破玩意坏了
The damn thing's broken!

72
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,190
- 没坏 我来弄就好了 - 不行
- It's not broken. Just let me do it. - No!

73
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,200
我受够了每次摆弄很久
I'm tired of coming to you for this

74
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,070
到头来还得找你求助
every single time I work late.

75
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,640
明白吗 我得自己搞定
All right? Gotta do it myself.

76
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,780
授人以渔 你听说过这句名言吧
"Teach a man to fish." You ever heard that saying?

77
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,160
上上个生日时你就答应教我钓鱼了
You promised to teach me to fish two birthdays ago.

78
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:26,710
别激怒我啊 这可人命关天
Stop aggravating me! This is important!

79
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,250
费城队参加了世界职棒系列赛
The Phillies are in the world series!

80
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,910
下次参赛估计得等下个世纪了
It might be another century before this happens again.

81
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,750
爸爸 你已经倒腾了十分钟了
Dad, you've been messing with that for ten minutes.

82
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,280
就让亚当来呗
Just let Adam do it.

83
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:36,340
不要
No. 

84
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,100
给我遥控器就好 给我遥控器
Just give me the remote. Give me the remote.

85
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,590
这儿呢 我来弄
Here. Let me do this.

86
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,930
真该死
The hell?

87
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,300
满满都是按钮 密密麻麻的
It's covered in buttons! Covered!

88
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,920
别管那些按钮了 用声控就好
Don't bother with the buttons. Use the voice command.

89
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:49,760
对吧 埃里卡
Right, Erica?

90
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,930
是的 新技术
Right. Um, it's new.

91
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,030
只要拿着遥控器 对着顶端说话
Just hold the remote and speak into the top.

92
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,980
录制世界职棒系列赛
Record world series.

93
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:00,480
没用啊
Nothing.

94
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,030
嘴唇靠近点儿 爸爸
Get your lips closer, dad.

95
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,370
哦 我懂了 就那儿啊
Oh, I see. R-right there.

96
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,880
录制
Record.

97
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,160
录制
Record.

98
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,160
没用啊
Nothing!

99
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:13,190
它还不能识别你的声音 你得说你的名字
It's not identifying your voice. You gotta say your name.

100
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,090
我的名字是
My name is...

101
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,240
默里
Murray...

102
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,770
戈德堡
Goldberg!

103
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,680
好像能听懂他似的
Like it understands him.

104
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:25,030
好吧 把那场该死的比赛录下来
All right. Just record the damn game.

105
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:27,720
她在哪儿
Where is she?

106
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,060
那个生了我却不给我自由的女人在哪儿 哈
Where's the woman who gave me life and nothing more, huh?

107
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,380
哦 哦 等等 我一直在等你
Whoa, whoa, stop. I've been waiting for you,

108
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,360
我们需要谈谈
and we need to talk.

109
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:34,550
忙着呢 我要给老妈打电话
Busy. I gotta call mom.

110
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,660
不行 跟我来
Um, no. You're coming with me.

111
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,830
要么别理我 要么就帮帮我...
Leave me alone, or so help me god...

112
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,820
你干嘛要揪我的小咪咪
Why'd you have to purple my nurple?

113
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,080
这跟你没关系
This doesn't involve you.

114
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,680
当然有关系
Of course it does!

115
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,080
老妈一整天都要崩溃了
Mom was freaking out all day

116
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,920
就因为你到目的地了没给她打电话
because you didn't call her when you got there.

117
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,330
当她进入焦虑状态时
And when she goes into worry mode,

118
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,620
把我也看管得紧紧的
she tightens the clamps on me, too.

119
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,130
- 你几乎毁了我的整个策略 - 什么策略
- You almost blew my whole system. - What system?

120
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,860
无视她的所有驾驶规则
The system where I ignore all of her driving rules

121
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,500
并且侥幸逃脱的策略
and get away with it.

122
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:03,920
接着说
Proceed.

123
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,730
上周我去两个街区外的莱妮家学习
Last week, I went to study at Lainey's house two blocks away,

124
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,840
像往常一样 我到了就给她打电话
and as always, I called when I got there.

125
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,020
我说 "老妈 我到了
I said, "I'm here, mom.

126
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,520
我们在放威豹乐队的音乐
We're playing Def Leppard records

127
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,740
做基菲爆米花 想你哦"
and making jiffy pop. Miss you."

128
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:14,610
所以呢
So?

129
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:19,000
其实... 我在听威豹乐队的音乐会...
So... I was at a Def Leppard concert...

130
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,610
而且是在新泽西
in New Jersey.

131
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,840
泽西 那可是红色区域
Jersey? That's the red zone.

132
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:23,990
说对了
Damn right it is.

133
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,220
和莱妮学习只是个幌子
Studying with Lainey was my cover story.

134
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,240
找到一个好幌子
You got a good cover story,

135
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,930
就可以随心所欲了
and you can do anything you want.

136
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,740
我甚至还去过曼哈顿

137

猜猜明晚我要去哪儿
And tomorrow night, guess where I'm going.

139
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,500
森林啤酒聚会

143
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,130
我从八年级起就没拉过小提琴
I haven't played violin since eighth grade,

144
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,550
不过她并不知道

145
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,670
不是吧 我能加入你们的乐队吗
No way. Can I join your band?

146
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,100
我柜子里有台电子琴
I have an electric keyboard in my closet.

147
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,810
笨蛋 自己玩去
Get your own thing, idiot.

148
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,330
那会是你们的损失

149
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,400
它有七十多种节奏设置

Stop! It's not a real band, and even if it was,

153
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:04,850
你的琴弹得弱爆了
you suck at keyboard.

154
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,620
你什么都弱爆了

155

162
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,490
好吧 就座吧 你们赢得了一顿胜利晚餐

我只能待几分钟

167
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,970
我不知道 我啥都没看出来
I don't know. I don't see what you see.

168
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,950
哦 老爸 你走之前 我给你买了件东西
Oh, dad, before you go, I bought you something.

169
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,100
生命警报器... "电视上的那种"
Life alert... "as seen on tv."

170
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,350
那个时候
Back in the day,

171
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,420
广告简单而切题
commercials were simple and to the point,

172
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:55,700
尤其是这个经典的...
especially this classic...

173
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:59,130
我摔倒了 我爬不起来
I've fallen, and I can't get up!

174
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,460
为什么没人帮帮她
Why is no one helping her?

175
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,110
救救她
Help her!

176
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,880
弗莱彻女士 我们会立刻前去救助
We're sending help immediately, Mrs. Fletcher.

177
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:06,530
太好了 他们要过去了
Oh, good, they're coming.

178
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:09,930
你在跟我开玩笑吗
Are you kidding me?

179
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,710
你为什么不直接给我买件写着
Why don't you get me a sweatshirt

180
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,910
"我老了"的运动衫
which says "I'm old"

181
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,330
然后把我送到鸭塘去喂鸭子
and send me out to the duck pond to feed the ducks?

182
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,560
老爸 你可是自己住
Dad, you live alone.

183
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,900
如果你摔倒了爬不起来怎么办
What happens if you fall and you can't get up?

184
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,200
我这一辈子
In my whole life,

185
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,310
从没绊倒 滑到或摔倒过
I've never once tripped, slipped, or fallen.

186
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,960
是啊 这简直是侮辱
Yeah! This is an insult!

187
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:28,360
我身体结实着呢 试试看

188
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,230
打一下我的腰 打呀

189
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,310
老妈 上啊 打一下外祖父

打呀
Do it.

191
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:35,500
老爸 我不会打你腰的
I'm not punching you in the kidney, dad.

192
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:38,080
你不想要吗 好吧 当个家庭负担
You don't want it? Fine. Be a burden on your family.

193
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:39,830
- 我会的 - 他会的
- I will. - He will.

194
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,430
虽然老妈自有办法达到她的目的
While my mom had her own strategy to get her way,

195
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,390
巴里却要用埃里卡的策略达到自己的目的
Barry was gonna use Erica's strategy to get his.

196
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,970
就按照我让你说的说
Just say what I told you to say.

197
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:53,010
别添枝加叶 也别做修饰渲染
Don't add anything and don't embellish.

198
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:58,270
嘿 老妈 听着
Hey, ma. Listen,

199
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:01,190
我想过了 我想说我真的很抱歉
I've been thinking, and I wanted to say how sorry I am

200
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,900
没在剧院给你打电话
for not calling you from the theater.

201
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,660
是嘛 谢谢 你这么做很成熟

204
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,740
我知道我说的不够多
I know I don't say it enough,

205
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,610
不过...我爱你 美女

206
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,080

是森林里的啤酒会 森林明白不

272
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,040
霍华德・柯塞尔 给我点甜头吧
Howard Cosell, give me the sweet stuff.

273
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,880
默里 关上电视
Murray, turn that tv off!

274
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:04,910
也许没有
Or not.

275
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,330
哦 额滴神
Oh, god.

276
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,410
巴里还没打电话 他已经出去快一个小时了
Barry hasn't called. He's been gone almost an hour.

277
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,980
我给罗杰・麦克法登家打了电话
I called Roger Mcfadden's house.

278
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,540
没人接
No one's answering.

279
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,250
- 你打了几次 - 八次
- How many times have you called? - Eight.

280
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,340
等你打了十五次再说
When you hit 15, then we'll talk.

281
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,970
意思是你就准备坐在这儿看棒球比赛
So you're just gonna sit here and watch a baseball game

282
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,100
而咱们的儿子此时可能正趴在
when our son might be laying facedown

283
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,130
某条小沟沟里
in a ditch somewhere.

284
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:26,360
也许是 但也许不是
Might be. But might not be.

285
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:27,900
我们现在唯一能确定的是
The only thing we know for sure

286
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:30,060
我看的是世界职棒些列赛
is I'm watching the world series.

287
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,600
你晚上怎么能睡得着
How do you sleep at night?

288
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,600
{\an8}另一层意思 你晚上睡得怎么样


289
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:34,790
没有白天睡得好 不过也不差
Not as good as I do during the day, but not bad.

290
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:38,520
放轻松 孩子不会有事的
Relax. Kid's gonna be fine.

291
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:39,780
不过他真有事
But he wasn't.

292
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:41,840
没问题 我能搞定
It's okay. I can fix this.

293
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:47,740
好 太好了
Okay. All right.

294
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,400
不
No!

295
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,100
妈妈
Mom!

296
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,180
我在罗杰家
I'm at Roger's house!

297
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,900
我平安到达了
I got here safely!

298
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,850
我爱...
I love...

299
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,970
当巴里整晚过得无比悲摧还马不停蹄时
While Barry's night was off and running,

300
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:08,450
我外祖父正要歇下来
my grandfather's was just winding down.

301
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:12,670
那个 我很想留你在这过夜 不过...
Yeah, I'd love for you to stay the night, but, uh...

302
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,680
我才发现明天早上有个早会
Turns out I got a meeting first thing in the morning.

303
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:18,030
哦 我以为你十年前就退休了呢 
Well, I thought you retired ten years ago.

304
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,530
没错 但是我还在做一些兼职的咨询工作
Yeah, well, I still do part-time consulting

305
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,550
偶尔还...
and the occasional...

306
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,200
你需要打车钱吗
Do you need money for a cab?

307
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,520
这是什么
What's this?

308
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,530
这不就是广告里出现的那东西
This is one of those things from the commercial.

309
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,930
你不会也戴这玩意儿吧
Well, you don't wear one of these?

310
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:32,600
不 不 这只是个恶作剧礼物
No, no. This is just, uh, it's a gag gift

311
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:35,470
是拳击俱乐部里的某个家伙送的
from some of the guys down at the boxing club, and...

312
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,050
逗吧
Hilarious.

313
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:40,760
今晚过得很有意思 我会打给你的
Well, this has been fun. I'll call you.

314
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,000
额 不要
Uh... No.

315
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:45,720
我打给你 让我来打
I'll call you. I... I do the calling.

316
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,940
难以置信
Unbelievable.

317
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,230
他妈的
Son of a bitch!

318
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,330
是的 我打电话是想问我儿子
Yes, I'm calling to see if my son

319
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,900
是否被送进了你们的急救室
might have been brought into your emergency room

320
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,360
今晚早些时候
earlier tonight.

321
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:07,290
呃 他身高一米七二 黑头发 白皮肤
Uh, he is 5'8", dark hair, fair skin,

322
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,930
一双漂亮的棕眼睛
beautiful brown eyes.

323
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:12,160
哦 他会是你见过的最可爱的小男孩儿
Oh, he was just the sweetest little baby you've ever seen.

324
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:13,820
什么 没有吗
What? No.

325
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,200
好的 谢谢你
Okay, thank you.

326
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:20,430
投的什么球这是 真烂
What is that pitch?! That's garbage!

327
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,930
我恨你  迪奇・ 诺尔斯
I hate you, Dickie Noles!

328
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:24,790
好了 他不在急诊室
Okay. He's not in the emergency room

329
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,890
不在警察局
or the police station

330
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,060
不在溜冰场 不在棒球练习场
or the roller rink or the batting cages

331
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,040
也不在绿色安全区域内四家冰激凌店
or any of the four ice cream shops

332
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:32,720
的任何一家 我真是个失败的母亲
in the green zone, and I have failed as a mother.

333
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,520
你其他事做的还不错
You're good at other things.

334
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:40,880
巴里
Barry!

335
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:43,160
不 是 是我 亲爱的
No, it's... it's just me, darling.

336
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:46,980
- 你的电话一直占线 而我 - 现在没空 
- Your line's been busy for quite a while now, and I... - Can't talk now!

337
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,570
该死
Damn it!

338
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:57,750
我受不了啦 出去找回我们的孩子 默里
I can't take it anymore. Go out and find our baby, Murray.

339
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,600
求你了 如果我出去 我就会知道比赛结果
Please! If I go out, I'll find out what happened in the game!

340
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:03,640
别管棒球了 你是不是有病啊
Enough with the baseball. What is wrong with you?

341
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:06,000
你怎么能不着急呢 他在外面哪
Why aren't you worried? He's out there.

342
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:08,290
可能伤着冻着或者饿着
He could be injured, or cold or hungry.

343
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:11,560
万一他内急怎么办 他不用公共厕所的
What if he has to make? He doesn't use public bathrooms!

344
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:14,440
贝弗 冷静点 好吗
Bevy, calm down, okay?

345
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,160
每次咱家小孩出门
Every time our kids leave the house,

346
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:19,730
你都会以为他们死了 直到事实证明并没有
you assume that they're dead until they prove otherwise.

347
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:23,050
要知道他们是聪明的有责任心的孩子
Know that they're smart, responsible kids.

348
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,320
要相信他们还活着
Assume that they're alive.

349
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,450
这是你说过的最蠢的话
That's the stupidest thing you've ever said!

350
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,600
待会儿见
I'll see you in a bit.

351
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:33,460
巴里
Barry?

352
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:37,300
不 不是巴里 是我 让亚当接电话
No, it's not Barry. It's me. Put Adam on the phone.

353
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,700
亚当 过来 接你外祖父电话
Adam, get in here, talk to your grandfather

354
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,280
不然他会一直打
so he'll stop tying up the line!

355
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,410
快点
Make it quick.

356
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,310
喂 波普斯
Yeah, pops?

357
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,040
当外祖父在寻求帮助时
While pops was looking for a little help,

358
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:48,930
我爸正在找巴里
my dad was out looking for Barry,

359
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,770
他也越来越担心
and he was growing increasingly worried

360
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,140
他会知道比赛结果
that he'd find out what happened in the game.

361
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:55,840
对费城球迷来说 这真是一个激动人心的夜晚啊
Quite an emotional night for Phillies fans...

362
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,740
要是我爸不快点找到巴里
If my dad didn't find Barry soon,

363
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,860
我哥就惨了
my brother was gonna pay.

364
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,250
打扰一下 警官
Excuse me, officer.

365
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,840
你有看到一个高中生在这附近开车吗
Did you see a high school kid driving around here?

366
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:09,710
头发卷卷 呆头呆脑的那个
Curly hair, kind of lumpy?

367
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,280
没有 但是森林里有个派对
No, but there's a party in the woods

368
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:13,610
- 在阿尔弗索普公园旁边 - 好的
- down by Alverthorpe Park. - Okay.

369
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,700
嘿 费城队 那个...
Hey, Phillies! Man, how about...

370
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,960
不不不
No, no, no!

371
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,480
我只是想看世界职业棒球大赛
I just wanna watch the world series!

372
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:22,130
我要杀了那个兔崽子
I'm gonna kill that kid!

373
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,010
波普斯 波普斯
Pops? Pops!

374
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,090
在这儿呢
Over here!

375
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,630
咋整的
What happened?

376
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,410
我摔了一跤...
I have fallen...

377
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:33,970
然后...起不来了
And I... Cannot get up.

378
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,600
就这样
There you go.

379
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:40,290
慢点 继续拖
Easy. Little more.

380
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,900
把浴袍往下拉点行不
Pull your robe down.

381
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,030
这是和服耶
It's a kimono.

382
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,250
那就把和服往下拉
Pull your kimono down.

383
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,380
他这么设计就是要炫
It's designed to be showy.

384
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:47,470
好吧 的确很炫
Well, it's working.

385
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,320
你别往下看就行了
Just don't look down!

386
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:51,400
我看到啥了 跟个知更鸟窝似的
What did I just see? It was like a robin's nest!

387
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,660
那是你角度不好
It's an unflattering angle.

388
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:55,120
那里怎么了
What's going on down there?

389
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:58,430
别看了 快把我拖到沙发那儿
Stop looking down and get me to the couch already!

390
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,710
哦 好吧
Oh! Okay.

391
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:01,360
你还好吗
You good?

392
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,170
恩 还好 我...现在没事了
Yeah, okay. I'm...I'm good now.

393
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,580
幸亏你来了 孩子
Thanks for dropping by, kid.

394
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,240
你真的没事吗
Are you sure you're good?

395
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:11,020
当然啦 这还用问
Of course. Like you even need to ask.

396
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,810
只是我好像记得你说过你从来没摔倒过
It's just that you said that you never fell before.

397
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:17,080
我把腰扭了 谁都可能碰到这事
I threw my back out. It could happen to anyone.

398
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:24,070
你打算拿这个怎么办
So what do you wanna do with this?

399
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,310
扔掉它
Chuck it!

400
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,770
我懂了 这玩意儿或许是有点丢人
I get it. This thing might be embarrassing,

401
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,730
但是...比你穿着浴袍摔倒好多了
but... no more embarrassing than that robe.

402
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,130
那是我那晚第二次
For the second time that night, 

403
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:39,360
看到我外祖父 我从未见过的一面
I saw a part of my grandfather I'd never seen before...

404
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:41,800
那一面其实很脆弱
The part that was actually vulnerable.

405
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,310
停车 拜托停车
Stop! Stop! Please!

406
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,520
停车 停...
Stop! Sto--uhh!

407
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:53,090
停车 停车
Stop! Stop!

408
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,240
我只是想借用一下你的无线电告诉我妈
I need your C.B. Radio to call my mom

409
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:56,730
让她知道我很安全
so she knows I'm safe!

410
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,030
不 不 不 不
No, no, no, no!

411
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:08,850
我爸爸在整个镇里转了近一个小时
My dad had spent the last hour driving all over town.

412
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,100
就在他开始觉得
Just as he was starting to think

413
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:12,930
我妈的疯狂也许不是无稽之谈时
my mom's craziness may not have been so crazy,

414
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:15,950
他看到了一件眼熟的外套...
he spotted a familiar jacket...

415
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,470
哦 嗨
Oh. Hi.

416
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,450
和一个眼熟的蠢货
And a familiar jackass.

417
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,210
你就不能在沟里坐着吗
You couldn't have been sitting up in a ditch?

418
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,550
或者在沟里舒舒服服地躺着
Or reclining comfortably in a ditch?

419
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,600
你非得趴地上啊 和她说的一模一样
No, you had to be facedown, exactly like she said!

420
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:37,290
亏我还跟你妈说可以相信你
And to think I told your mom you could be trusted,

421
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,550
虽然主要因为我想看比赛
mostly 'cause I wanted to watch the game.

422
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,760
但是你知道吗 我其实有一点想
But you know what? A small part of me

423
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:46,360
嘿 他也不至于蠢得不可救药啊
actually thought, "hey, he's not a complete moron."

424
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:50,360
发生这种事 一小部分原因是我蠢得不可救药
Only some of this happened 'cause I'm a complete moron.

425
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:52,190
但主要是因为老妈制定的愚蠢的规则
The rest is 'cause of mom's stupid rules.

426
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,420
嘿 她制定规则还不是为了保护你
Hey, her rules are there to protect you.

427
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,370
我看到你的外套在马路中间 差点没把我吓死
I almost died when I saw your jacket in the road.

428
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,750
你也担心我吗
You worry about me, too?

429
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,830
拜托 别逼我说出这种话
Oh, don't put words in my mouth.

430
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,880
我当然担心你
Of course I do.

431
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,470
今晚的事 决不能让你妈知道
Your mom can't know anything about this.

432
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,930
啥 你要跟她撒谎吗
What? You're gonna lie to mom?

433
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,700
那必须的 她要是知道了
Absolutely! She finds out about this,

434
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,130
在你四十岁之前 你休想走出
you're not gonna be allowed to leave the house

435
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:17,010
家门一步 到那时我这辈子也完了
until you're 40, and then my life is ruined, too!

436
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,510
太棒了 那我就脱身了
Nice! I'm off the hook, then.

437
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,300
但是 你被秘密禁足了
You are so grounded. Secretly, though.

438
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,720
接下来三个月
You will choose to stay in every weekend

439
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:26,590
每个周末你都得待在家里 直到我大发慈悲
for the next three months, and for the love of god,

440
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:28,740
还你自由之后
when I do let you back out in the world,

441
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:32,150
你到了目的地得给我打电话
you will call me when you get there.

442
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,530
我会的 我保证
I will. I promise.

443
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,550
我替我朋友扔的
I was throwing that for a friend.

444
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,550
还有告诉你那个白痴姐姐 她也被秘密禁足了
And tell your stupid sister that she's secretly grounded, too.

445
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,790
老爸你真是太好了
Thanks for being so cool about this.

446
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,950
我以为费城队输了之后
I thought you'd be in the worst mood

447
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,280
你的心情肯定糟糕透顶
after the Phillies lost.

448
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,610
滚出去
Get out.

449
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,930
躺下来
Lie down.

450
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,280
我要从你身上碾过去
I'm gonna run you over.

451
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:11,960
所以我哥哥其实用三个月的自由生活
And so my brother crammed three months of partying

452
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:14,120
换来了一个疯狂的晚上
into one epic night of awesome.

453
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,650
至于波普斯
As for pops,

454
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,270
他也开始意识到
he was starting to realize it wasn't so bad

455
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,020
放弃一丢丢自由 换来家人的安心
to give up a piece of his freedom

456
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:23,280
也不是件坏事
for his family's peace of mind.

457
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,290
还是很帅
Still got it.

458
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,910
当时他在等拖车
So he's waiting for the tow truck,

459
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,630
按照守则三 他乖乖待在车里
he stays in the car, rule number three...

460
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,200
最终让我妈放心的
Ultimately it wasn't my mom's elaborate rules

461
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,420
不是她煞费苦心制定的规则
that put her at ease...

462
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:37,700
还有
And listen to this.

463
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:41,510
他现在正在罗杰・麦克法登家学习呢
He's over at Roger Mcfadden's studying right now...

464
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,310
而是我爸精心编排的谎言
It was my dad's elaborate lies.

465
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,730
他真是个乖孩子
He is such a great kid.

466
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,720
知道那是他们最后一晚的自由生活之后
Knowing it was their last night of freedom,

467
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:49,210
巴里和埃里卡珍惜每分每秒
Barry and Erica made every moment count...

468
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,410
他们的确很开心
And it was glorious...

469
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:55,210
直到五分钟后警察突袭了那个地方
Until the cops raided the place five minutes later.

470
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:58,920
今天晚上会放新版"霹雳游侠"
That's a new "Knight Rider" on tonight.

472
00:19:58,930 --> 00:19:59,980

Mind if I tape it?

473
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,400
当然不介意 其实
No! Um, as a matter of fact,

474
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:06,540
你可以试试这个新的声控功能
why don't you use, uh, the new voice command?

475
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:09,290
- 真的吗 - 当然 告诉它你的名字
- For real? - Yeah, for real. Tell it your name.

476
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,590

Hi. I'm Barry Goldberg.

477
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,920
然后告诉它你要做什么
Now, uh, tell it to do something.

478
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:16,460
遥控器 转到"霹雳游侠"
Remote, turn to "Knight Rider."

479
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,310

That's pretty cool.

480
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,310
等等 真的可以 让我试试
Wait a minute. Did it? Give it to me a second here.

481
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:24,960
回到"胡克警探"

482
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,020
不是 错了
No, wrong way!

483
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:29,790
"胡克警探" 让它转到"胡克警探"
"T.J. Hooker"! Tell it to go back to "T.J. Hooker." 

484
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:30,530
不 你自己说吧
No, you tell it.

485
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:35,090
好吧 遥控器 我是默里...戈德堡
All right, remote, this is Murray... Goldberg.

486
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,900
请转回"胡克警探"
Please go back to "T.J. Hooker."

487
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:38,710

No!

488
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,900
错了
Wrong way!

489
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:42,860
你知道威廉・夏特纳主演的"胡克警探"

491
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,740
他又陷进去了
And he fell for it again.

492
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,910
胡克 警探
Hooker! T.J.!

493
00:20:47,111 --> 00:20:49,680
亲爱的默里老爸 抱歉总是浪费你看电视的时间


494
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,560
我命令你给我走开
I want you to get away from there.

495
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:54,180
挡住我了 真讨厌
I can't see, and it's very annoying.

496
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,150
讨厌吗
Is it annoying?

497
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,300
- 给我 - 哦 不
- Give me that. - Whoa. No.

498
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:00,680
把摄像机给我 我要砸了它
I want that camera. I'm gonna take it and break it!
