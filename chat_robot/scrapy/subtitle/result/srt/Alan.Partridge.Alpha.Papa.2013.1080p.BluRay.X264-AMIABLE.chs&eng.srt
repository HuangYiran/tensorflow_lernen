00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,836
# 那是我回家后 #
# That's my only joy #

128
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:21,422
# 唯一剩下的乐趣 #
# Waiting for me when I get home #

129
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:22,631
# 那那 #
# Na-na #

130
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:24,546
# 我只想要 #
# And what I need

131
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:26,715
# 像你一样的女孩 #
# is a girl like you

132
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,851
# 只要你 只要你属于我 #
# Just to call, call my very own #

133
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,480
# 请你接受我 亲爱的 接受我 宝贝 #
# So you gotta feel for me, baby. Feel for me, baby #

134
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:37,313
# 请你接受我 亲爱的 接受我 宝贝 #
# Yeah, you gotta feel for me, baby. Feel for me, baby #

135
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,528
# 请你接受我 亲爱的 接受我 宝贝 #
# You gotta feel for me, baby. Feel for me, baby #

136
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,860
# 请爱我一些 #
# Oh, gimme some love #

137
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,492
爱死这声音了
Love that noise.

138
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,744
麦克 到外面去擤鼻涕
Michael, do it outside.

139
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:52,324
- 早上好 麦克  - 早上好 帕屈吉先生
- Morning, Michael.  - Morning, Mr. Partridge.

140
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,123
- 布 赢了  - 我是想和你顶拳
- Paper.  - I was doing a fist bump.

141
00:08:56,286 --> 00:09:00,086
- 你输了当然会这么说  - 只是代替握手
- You would say that now you've lost.  - It's instead of a handshake.

142
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:02,960
有人说这个比握手更卫生
Some people say it's more hygienic than a handshake.

143
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,800
但谁能说你拳头上就没蹭到屎呢?
But who's to say you can't get shit on your fist?

144
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:09,341
- 你听到他开你玩笑了吗?  - 我听到了 但是奥斯卡・王尔德说过
- Did you hear him making fun of you?  - I did, but as Oscar Wilde said,

145
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:12,056
"在这世上只有一件事比被人议论还要糟糕"
"There's only one thing worse than being talked about."

146
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,312
- 癌症  - 不是 "那就是被忽略"
- Cancer.  - No. "Not being talked about."

147
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,560
奥斯卡・王尔德说这比癌症还要糟糕?
Oscar Wilde said that's worse than cancer?

148
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:19,021
是啊 我想他可能在聚会
Yeah. I think he was at a party.

149
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:21,687
可能只是个爱炫耀的基佬
Probably just being a gay show-off.

150
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,238
# 谢普 谢普 谢普 #
# Shape, Shape, Shape #

151
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,370
你知道我真正喜欢的是什么吗? 我喜欢
Do you know what I really like? I like waking up

152
00:09:25,383 --> 00:09:27,367
早晨醒来 呼吸着新鲜空气...
in the morning, breathing in the air and er...

153
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:30,904
意识到我熬过了一个晚上 还没有尿床
actually realising I've made it through the night and I haven't wet the bed.

154
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,244
当然 我是在开玩笑 但是...
No, I am joking, obviously, but er...

155
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:37,912
这些天真的是非常非常难熬
they were, of course, very, very dark days indeed.

156
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,421
但是现在都过去了
But they're all behind me now.

157
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,957
- 早上好 安吉拉  - 早上好 阿兰
- Morning, Angela.  - Morning, Alan.

158
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,342
阿兰・帕屈吉刚刚走进大楼
Alan Partridge has just walked into the building.

159
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,720
像白宫精英一样边走边话说
Walking and talking, like The West Wing.

160
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,673
- 希望他没有伤到自己!  - 总统先生 有红色警戒
- Hope he hasn't hurt himself!  - Mr. President, we have a code red.

161
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,763
- 我从来没看过那个节目  - 我也没有
- I've never seen the show.  - No, me neither.

162
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,520
小心拐角
Corner coming up.

163
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,148
你永远不知道拐个弯后面有什么
You never know what's round the corner.

164
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,272
一般还有更多的拐角
More corners, usually.

165
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,730
想象一下一个没有拐角的世界
Imagine a world without corners.

166
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:10,281
没有人能抄近路 大家都只能绕圈
No-one would be able to cut any. Everyone would be going round in circles.

167
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,583
哇
Wow.

168
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,503
我喜欢这样
I enjoyed that.

169
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:22,756
告诉你一件事情
I will tell you one thing.

170
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:24,666
在我那段困难时期
When I was going through my bad times,

171
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:29,839
我觉得诺福克可能并不是一个好地方...
I found Norfolk was perhaps maybe not the place to be and...

172
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:33,387
因为它不景气 而且还有种...
just because it's so flat and there was a sort of a...

173
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,349
阴冷的气息 但现在很明显...
a bleakness about the place, but obviously now...

174
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:38,980
你是一个不错的主播 阿兰 不要忘记这一点
You're a good broadcaster, Alan. Don't forget that.

175
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,228
- 我不会忘的 小帕  - 你看到便条了吗?
- I wasn't planning to, Pat.  - You seen this memo?

176
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,519
"令人激动的开端 充满希望的未来"
"Exciting new phase. Here's to the future."

177
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:46,359
- 我在这里的日子没有几天了  - 没人会被辞退的
- My days are numbered.  - No-one's getting sacked.

178
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:48,432
就像那个管理员鲍比・布拉歇斯
It's like Bobby Brushes, the caretaker, when

179
00:10:48,445 --> 00:10:50,367
在游泳馆被指控的时候
the swimming pool allegations came out.

180
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:51,614
- 他惨到家了  - 是啊
- He was in bits.  - Yeah.

181
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:55,622
结果他只是在帮那些小家伙擦干 他在做好事
It turned out he was just helping those lads towel off. He was being nice.

182
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:58,416
- 他甚至都不认识他们  - 是啊 他现在又在哪里?
- He didn't even know them.  - Yeah, but where is he now?

183
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:01,454
- 他在自己做生意  - 看 他又振作起来了
- He runs his own business.  - There. He's back on his feet.

184
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,337
出租充气城堡
Rents out bouncy castles.

185
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,214
是给成人的吧?
For adults, yeah?

186
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:08,343
- 看看这个便条  - 我看到了 很简单
- Look at this memo.  - I've seen the memo. It's quite simple.

187
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,471
格尔戴尔传媒公司重新设想了我们的核心品牌价值
Goredale Media are simply re-imagining our core brand values

188
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:15,475
给它起了一个新名字 方便公司在多平台发展
and giving it a name more fitting to multi-platform content delivery.

189
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,098
- 他们都是八面玲珑的人  - 八面玲珑的人解雇别人
- They're people people.  - People people sack people.

190
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:21,435
不是的 小帕 普通人解雇别人 八面玲珑的人取悦别人
No, Pat. People sack people. People people please people.

191
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,817
- 阿兰 你能帮忙和他们说句话吗?  - 你会吗?
- Can you have a word with them, Alan?  - Would you?

192
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:27,521
呃... 当然 只要我能让他们都聚集在一个房间里
Er... sure. As soon as I can get them all in the same room together.

193
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,531
- 他们现在都在会议室  - 太好了
- They're all up in the boardroom now.  - That's great.

194
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,988
谢谢 谢谢 阿兰 你真够朋友
Thank you. Thank you, Alan. You're a pal.

195
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:35,370
朋友就该仗义
Well, pals is pals.

196
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:41,376
现在大家在看第六页的北诺福克第四季度数据
If we're all looking at the last quarterly figures for North Norfolk on page 6.

197
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,832
接下来请翻到第五页
Then if you turn to page 5.

198
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:49,134
大家好 我不想耽误大家的日程安排 但是可以给我个机会说两句吗?
Hi, guys, don't want to be an agenda-bender, but any chance of a wa-wa?

199
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:53,088
- 阿兰 现在不合适  - 没关系 我们有时间 进来吧
- It's not a good time, Alan.  - It's fine, we've time. Come in.

200
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:56,596
我们调整了另外一件事 好吧 你说吧
Oh, we moved the other thing. Yeah, it's a good time.

201
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:58,305
我是阿兰・帕屈吉
Alan. Alan Partridge.

202
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,603
我是杰森・特雷斯维尔 格尔戴尔传媒公司的总经理
Jason Tresswell, MD of Goredale Media.

203
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:04,107
我不是阿兰・阿兰・帕屈吉 我是阿兰 逗号 阿兰・帕屈吉
It's not "Alan Alan Partridge". It's "Alan, comma, Alan Partridge".

204
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,063
我知道有些人有两个名字
I know some people do have two names.

205
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,103
比如莎莎・嘉宝
Zsa Zsa Gabor, for instance.

206
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,021
还有杜兰・杜兰乐队
Duran Duran.

207
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:11,986
是啊 这个不是很好
Yeah, that's not as good.

208
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,947
还有... 克里斯・克里斯托佛森
Um... Kris Kristofferson.

209
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,162
不错的开场对话 先生们 我们开始说正事
Excellent small talk. Gentlemen, to business.

210
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:21,867
作为台里资深DJ之一
I am here as one of the more senior D-jocks at this station.

211
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,831
我来这儿是谈工作的
I'm here to talk about jobs.

212
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,460
这里就像纳粹一样不是吗?
Like a Nazi officer this, isn't it?

213
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,541
应该... 立正
Should er... snap my heels together.

214
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,296
- 稍息!  - 你好
- Achtung!  - Guten Tag.

215
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,257
安静! 对不起 我不是故意打中你的
Silence! Sorry. I meant to miss you.

216
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,513
我希望你们为我做件事
I want you to do something for me.

217
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:41,015
我希望你们去除偏见 放到一个叫做"偏见"的盒子里
I want you to take all your prejudices, put them in a box marked "prejudices",

218
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:44,143
放到一边 不要留一点偏见...
put it to one side, wipe the prejudice juice off your hands...

219
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:47,226
我可以打断你吗? 改变是好的 你不应该害怕它
Can I just stop you there? Change is healthy, you shouldn't fear it.

220
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,690
我什么都不害怕 即使是大象也不害怕
I'm not scared of anything. Not even an elephant,

221
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,605
很有意思 现在房间里就有一头
which is interesting, because there's one in this room.

222
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:54,566
- 想知道他的名字吗?  - 派特・法莱尔
- Wanna know his name?  - Pat Farrell.

223
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:57,360
就是派特・法莱尔 派特的听众都是老年人
It's Pat Farrell. Pat's audience is old.

224
00:12:57,527 --> 00:13:00,701
就像狗一样 老年人都有一种盲目的忠实
Old people, much like dogs, are blindly loyal.

225
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,537
如果派特跳槽到了希达电台 他们会跟着走
And if Pat hi-tails it to Cedar FM and they follow,

226
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,920
你们将会流失大量的听众 是一次惨重的损失
you've got a grey exodus on your hands. A grexodus.

227
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:12,050
偏见的盒子看起来也不那么好看了是吗?
Hm. That prejudices box doesn't seem quite so cool any more, does it?

228
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,757
是的 但我们也买下了希达电台
Yeah, but we bought Cedar FM as well.

229
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,263
我不知道 我不知道
I didn't know that. I did not know that.

230
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:28,024
- 问题是...  - 你刚才在讲派特・法莱尔
- The point is...  - You were talking about Pat Farrell.

231
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,693
派特・法莱尔是个不错的人
Pat Farrell is a great guy.

232
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:34,698
开会的时候他总是作为协会成员
He's always the first to speak up at union meetings,

233
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,488
第一个发言
being a member of a union.

234
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:43,040
他还是一个爱尔兰人 同样很奇怪 如果你喜欢骂人这会是个加分项
He's also Irish, which again, weirdly, a plus point, if you like swearing.

235
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,950
"去你的这个" "去你的那个"
"Feckin' dis" and "Feckin' dat".

236
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:48,711
有些爱尔兰人说"去你的"比"他妈的"好多了
Some Irish people say "feck off" isn't as bad as "Fuck off"

237
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,713
但我觉得这都是放屁
but I think that's bullshit or bellshit.

238
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:54,092
- 而且他的脏话太多了  - 这很有趣
- The bottom line is, he swears too much.  - This is all very interesting...

239
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,093
我可以用十个字总结派特・法莱尔
I can sum up Pat Farrell in ten words.

240
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:59,927
派特真的不好 让他走吧
Pat isn't very good so let him go, guys, seriously.

241
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,550
我可以用三个字概括
I can condense that to three words.

242
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,309
解雇他
Just sack Pat.

243
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,194
这就是我的演说
That completes my presentation.

244
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,531
先生们 你们请继续
Gentlemen, I'll leave you to your biscuits.

245
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,497
手套
Gloves.

246
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,161
他妈的
Oh, fuck.

247
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:30,666
还有一只
Glove.

248
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,213
# 谢普电台 #
# Shape #

249
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,966
# 您想要的电台 #
# The way you want it to be #

250
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:39,922
啊! 那是弗利特伍德・马克组合的"软岩可卡因爱好者"
Ahh! That was soft rock cocaine enthusiasts, Fleetwood Mac.

251
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:42,182
您正在收听的是"正午特播"
And this was Mid-Morning Matters.

252
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:43,725
再强调一遍
Where once again,

253
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,931
- 正午... 最精彩  - 最精彩
- mid-morning... mattered.  - Mattered.

254
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:48,472
我们应该一起说
Supposed to do it in sync.

255
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,273
- 要留一段空白  - 对不起
- Always leave a gap.  - Sorry.

256
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,809
很简单 很简单
Simple. Very simple.

257
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:56,984
- 您现在正在收听的是谢普电台  - # 您想要的电台 #
- You're listening to Shape.  - # The Way You Want It To Be #

258
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:04,283
对 会很长时间吗?
Mm-hm. Right. And will it take long?

259
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:09,834
会很长时间 嗨 派特 我一会再去找你
It will take long. OK. Hi, Pat. I'll catch you later.

260
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:13,045
我对此很不高兴 但是...
I'm not happy about it, but...

261
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:16,083
我只能这样做 不是吗?
I'll have to go along with it, won't I?

262
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:22,723
问... 问题是我在打着电话的时候手机也会响
The... the problem is that the phone rings even when I'm speaking on it,

263
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,848
很奇怪
so it sounds bloody weird.

264
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:30,021
其实我觉得刚才又响了 你听到了吗? 是吧?
In fact, I think it just did it then. Did you hear it? Yes?

265
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,273
他也听见了
Yeah. He heard it too.

266
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:35,068
好 这事就交给你了
OK, well, I'll leave it with you.

267
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:37,194
嗯 是的
Mm-hm. Yep.

268
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:38,730
是的
Yep.

269
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,694
谢谢你 苏珊
All right. Thanks, Susan.

270
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:46,328
如果杰夫・苏珊不修那个手机 那就得破财了 
If Geoff Susan doesn't mend that phone, there'll be hell to pay.

271
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:49,582
他们甚至都不让我对我的听众说声再见
They wouldn't even let me say goodbye to my listeners.

272
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,243
只给我三十分钟收拾行李
Just gave me 30 minutes to clear out my locker.

273
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,955
至少我弄脏了他们的杯子
Well, at least I'm getting their mugs dirty.

274
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,208
谢谢你 阿兰 你总为难我
Thanks, Alan. You always stuck up for me.

275
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,297
不像别人
Not like the others.

276
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:04,339
你继续和杰夫聊吧
Well, I'll let you get back to... Geoff.

277
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,802
- 谁是杰夫?  - 杰夫・苏珊
- Who's Geoff?  - Geoff Susan.

278
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,512
哦 对啊
Oh, yes, of course.

279
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,393
啊...
Ahh...

280
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:19,320
我这样做是对的 不是吗 琳? 
I did the right thing, didn't I, Lynn?

281
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:23,195
他自己也会料到有这么一天的
I mean, I think he knew his days were numbered.

282
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,325
这更像是一种安乐死
More of an assisted suicide really.

283
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:29,740
我让他飞往瑞士 填几张表 然后...
I just flew him to Switzerland and filled out a few forms and...

284
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,454
从机场溜走
sloped off to the airport.

285
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,502
说实话 琳 我感觉糟透了
I've got to be honest, Lynn, I'm feeling pretty crummy.

286
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:37,960
派特是爱尔兰人吗?
Pat's Irish, isn't he?

287
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,669
当然
To be sure.

288
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,585
那你为毛不给新芬党(爱尔兰政党)贡献五十镑呢?
Why don't you donate 50 pounds to Sinn Fein?

289
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,470
完美
Perfect.

290
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,135
我喜欢这种声音
Love that noise.

291
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:49,016
因为能使我远离香肠卷
Keep me away from the sausage rolls.

292
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,722
我又穿回这件既肥又宽的衣服了
I'm wearing my chubby clothes again.

293
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,975
- 我看到了  - 是说我胖 还是衣服大了?
- I noticed.  - What the chub, or the clothes?

294
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,764
- 你好 肥肥  - 我是胖了
- Hi, Chub  - My chub.

295
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,849
没那么搞笑吧 琳
Not that funny, Lynn.

296
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:04,361
- 我以前常找鸡  - 牛叉
- I used to go with prostitutes.  - Brilliant.

297
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:07,323
可卡因是个诱因 可卡因 妓女 
Cocaine, that was a trigger. Cocaine, prostitutes.

298
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:11,327
有点像个循环 然后直到把鲜绿的胆汁都吐出来
Bit of a cycle. Puking up the old er... luminous green bile.

299
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,083
这样 我才离开
Yeah, I was withdrawing.

300
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:16,995
我有保镖
I've got my minder with me.

301
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,038
- 你是说琳?  - 她看起来不是很结实
- Lynn?  - She might not seem tough,

302
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,583
但我曾见她一分钟踩死五十只小强
but I once saw her stamp on 50 cockroaches in a minute.

303
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,467
他没看见 他那时在隔壁
He didn't see. He was in the next room.

304
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:25,503
- 那是在威尔士的事了  - 但这事是真的
- It was in Wales.  - It's true, yeah.

305
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,594
我只能听见嘎扎嘎扎和咚咚咚的跺脚声
All I could hear was crunch, crunch, crunch, stamp, stamp, stamp.

306
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,851
我还以为她边喝麦片粥边跳乡村舞呢
I thought she was country dancing whilst eating cereal.

307
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:35,013
我以为是末日了呢 太多小强了
I thought it was the End of Days. They were legion.

308
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,601
琳爱读圣经
Lynn likes The Bible.

309
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:38,604
我无法理解飞蛾
I've never understood moths.

310
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:41,394
它们只在晚上出来 但又被光所吸引
They only come out at night, yet they're attracted to light.

311
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,802
我就搞不懂为毛它们不白天出来呢
I don't know why they just don't come out during the day.

312
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:46,657
我不多说了 如果把蝴蝶换成...
I've nothing to add to that. If you substituted butterfly...

313
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,739
能给我拿点香肠卷吗?
Could you go and get me some sausage rolls?

314
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:52,826
如果把飞蛾换成蝴蝶 那就有诗意了
If you substituted butterfly for moth, I think it would sound like poetry, yeah.

315
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,787
悲剧地是 沃兹沃斯(英国诗人)没说:
Unfortunately, Wordsworth didn't say:

316
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:58,795
"我似飞蛾天自游 却于抽屉吃跳虫"
"I wandered lonely as a moth to eat some jumpers in a drawer."

317
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:03,211
"倘若那还不够糟 啃我袜子于荒野"
"As if that wasn't bad enough, it ate my sock upon the moor."

318
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:12,266
我也搞不懂荒野里怎会有袜子
Yeah. It's just... I don't know why a sock could be on the moor.

319
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,393
也许是个手套
A mitten, maybe.

320
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:16,896
我都吐出我的胃黏膜了
I actually spewed up some of my stomach lining.

321
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:20,103
你以前... 吸过海洛因没?
I don't know if you've ever done er... done any horse, have you?

322
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,940
- 我骑过驴  - 我是说海洛因
- I've ridden a donkey.  - No, no, no, I mean heroin.

323
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,525
我知道你的意思 我没吸过
I know what you mean. No, I've not done heroin.

324
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:28,532
- 我不喜欢我电影里的标题  - 如果你能读 就读本书吧
- I don't likes in my films.  - If you can read, read a book.

325
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:31,240
我没看过什么"公民凯恩"或"黑与白"
Citizen Kane. Black and white. I haven't seen that.

326
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:34,656
对我来说 最好的电影一直是"教父"
I tell you what, the best film for me, ever, is still The Godfather.

327
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,916
- 好电影  - 太完美了
- Ah, amazing film.  - Perfect film.

328
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,543
"我将给他开出一个无法拒绝的条件"
"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"

329
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:41,545
- 演得真好  - 演得真好
- Amazing acting, though.  - Great acting.

330
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:43,001
告诉你什么是更好的
I tell you what's even better

331
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:46,714
当我说摄影角度时很多人都震惊了
a lot of people are shocked when I say this... the camera angles.

332
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:48,719
- 阿兰 过来一下  - 摄影角度?
- Alan, I need a word.  - Camera angles?

333
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:51,263
这件事相当棘手
It's rather delicate.

334
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:54,517
记得你带我去溜冰场吃的那顿圣诞大餐吗?
Remember when you took me for that Christmas meal at the ice rink?

335
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,973
记得那个给鞋消毒的女人吗?
You remember that woman disinfecting the boots?

336
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,313
就是对你一见倾心的那个
The one that took a shine to you.

337
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,600
我回家了 然后你和她就...
I went home and you and her...

338
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,727
这不关我的事
Well, it's... none of my business.

339
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:08,148
虽然不关你的事 但我还是得说 我去了她家
It is none of your business, but for the record, went back to her place,

340
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:11,818
一起看了"空中浩劫" 然后就在大扶手椅上睡着了
watched Air Crash Investigation, then I fell asleep in her big armchair.

341
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,406
很普通的一个女人
A perfectly normal woman.

342
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,162
她在那
Well, she's here.

343
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,369
琳 帮我摆脱他 她是个喝醉的种族歧视者 
Lynn, get rid of her. She's a drunk racist.

344
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,121
- 一个我还能受得了 两个我不行啊  - 好吧
- I'll tolerate one, but not both.  - Fine.

345
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:22,541
你说过我可以随时来的
But you said I could pop by any time.

346
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,956
我知道 但我的事业命悬一线
I know, but my career's hanging by a thread.

347
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,295
- 我给你丢脸了 对吧?  - 不是 不是
- And I'm an embarrassment, am I?  - No, no.

348
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,923
你只想上我 你利用我
You just wanted sex, you used me.

349
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:31,679
也许你利用了我
Well, maybe you used me.

350
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,932
我... 我不想说那天晚上发生了什么
I... I didn't have much of a say over what went on that night.

351
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,602
没听见你抱怨啊
Didn't hear you complaining.

352
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:40,271
- 我不能说话啊  - 那待会我家见
- I couldn't speak.  - See you round mine again, then.

353
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,976
我不知道... 我... 我...
I... don't know, I'm... I'm...

354
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:46,357
- 我家咋了?  - 都是些狗叫声
- What's wrong with my place?  - Well... all those dogs barking.

355
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,192
那也是它们的卧室啊
But it's their bedroom too.

356
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:50,490
可以跟你说句话吗?
May I have a word?

357
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,538
你尽说些废话!
You're talking clap... crap!

358
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:00,496
我气爆时像个中国佬!
I sound like a fucking Chinky when I'm pissed!

359
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:07,548
好了 都好了
There we go. All done.

360
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:11,169
- 你给她说啥了?  - 我说上帝爱每一个人
- What did you say to her?  - I told her that God loves everyone.

361
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,629
即使是荡妇
Even sluts.

362
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:16,015
- 晚安 琳  - 晚安 阿兰
- Good night, Lynn.  - Night, Alan.

363
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,160
有人吗?
Hello?

364
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,287
太有意思了 
Very funny. Tee-hee.

365
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,706
很好
Very impressive.

366
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:53,215
他们一定是匆忙离开的 有怪事 
Oh, they must have left in a hurry. Something weird's happened.

367
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:04,977
你们吓到我了 快出来吧...
All right, you freaked me out, so just... pack it...

368
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:06,356
你在这儿!
There you are!

369
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,983
派特? 啊!
Pat? Agh!

370
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,609
倒了
I'm down.

371
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,497
你...
You...

372
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,788
想害我?
You step to me?

373
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:31,420
赛门
Simon.

374
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:33,175
呃...
Er...

375
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:35,336
好吧 我还是继续跑吧
Yeah, all right. I'll go on without you.

376
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:53,237
停车! 停车! 停车!
Stop! Stop! Stop!

377
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:55,819
- 我来开车  - 什么?
- I need to commandeer this vehicle.  - What?

378
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,824
- 有个疯子拿枪追我  - 嗯...
- There's a mad man with a gun.  - Um...

379
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,077
- 他是爱尔兰人!  - 上车
- He's Irish!  - Get in.

380
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:05,329
你为毛坐得离方向盘这么近? 都能用我的蛋蛋来驾驶了!
Why do you sit so close to the wheel? I could steer with my balls!

381
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,745
- 最近的警局在哪?  - 就在这
- Where's the nearest police station?  - Just here.

382
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:11,789
谢了
Oh... thanks.

383
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:14,050
你是阿兰・帕屈吉吗?
Are you Alan Partrid...?

384
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:19,676
人身侵犯 殴打 绑架 慢性暴行
Assault, battery, kidnap, chronic thuggery,

385
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,430
攻击 实际身体伤害 严重人体伤害...
brandishment, actual bodily harm, grievous bodily harm...

386
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:25,887
- 伤害  - 就说说你所看见的吧
- harm.  - Just stick to what you saw,

387
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:28,393
我们会判断是否是实际身体伤害或严重人体伤害
and we'll decide if it's ABH or GBH.

388
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:30,729
- 你是说H?  - 对啊
- You mean aitch?  - That's what I said.

389
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,518
你貌似刚说的是哈H
Nearly, you said haitch.

390
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,685
"哈"是这个字母的发音 H是它的名
"Ha" is the sound of the letter, aitch is its name.

391
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,864
一个是哈 一个是H 都不是"哈H"
One is ha, the other is aitch. Neither is "haitch".

392
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,902
- 抱歉 我有点紧张  - 帕屈吉先生?
- I'm sorry, I'm a bit nervous.  - Mr. Partridge?

393
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,319
- 我们还有事要谈  - 哦...
- Something else we need to talk about.  - Oh...

394
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,579
- 你不会有麻烦的  - 好吧
- You're not in trouble.  - Oh, fine.

395
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,084
我从没坐过警车
I've never been in a police car before.

396
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:50,336
能把车窗摇下来吗?
May I lower the window, please?

397
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:59,090
呼叫狐步山 "阿尔法爸爸"到了 
Foxtrot Sierra. Alpha Papa arriving at the school building.

398
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:00,971
- 长官  - 帕屈吉先生
- Officer.  - Mr. Partridge.

399
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:04,009
- 你刚在警局  - 我就在车上
- You were at the police station.  - I was just in the car with you.

400
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,222
- 跟我来  - 嗯
- If you want to follow me, please.  - Huh.

401
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,479
- 这边  - 来了
- This way, please, sir.  - Yep.

402
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:12,391
开始行动
Let's do it.

403
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:18,314
帕屈吉先生 这是我们这次行动的金牌指挥官
Mr. Partridge, this is the Gold Commander of the operation.

404
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:22,326
- 你真的被那样称呼?  - 只在这次活动中
- Seriously, is that what you're called?  - On this operation, yes.

405
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:24,403
我是代理局长珍妮特・怀特海德
I'm Acting Chief Constable Janet Whitehead.

406
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:27,286
- 很荣幸  - 我是马汀・费奇
- An honour.  - And I'm Martin Fitch.

407
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:29,284
发送
Send.

408
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,999
来自苏格兰场人质危机解救部门
From Scotland Yard's Hostage and Crisis Unit.

409
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:34,004
是来管理谈判进程的
Here to lead the negotiation.

410
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:36,257
不好意思 到底谁是主管啊?
Er... little bit awkward. Who's in charge?

411
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,964
毫无疑问是这位女士
Make no mistake, this lady is in charge.

412
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:43,423
目前的情况就是 派特拒绝和我们直接交谈
So here's the situation. Pat is refusing to speak to us directly.

413
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:47,560
但只要他能通过你和我们谈 他愿意放三个人质
He's willing to give us three hostages but only if he can talk to us through you.

414
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:50,044
我们要知道派特为什么这样做
Now, we need to know why Pat has done this so

415
00:23:50,057 --> 00:23:52,394
才能稳定局势
we can draw things to a peaceful conclusion.

416
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:54,354
好 我和他谈 没问题
Yeah, sure, I'll talk to him. Deal.

417
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,610
抱歉 错了
Sorry, wrong person.

418
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:58,609
来
Come here.

419
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:04,531
你有在用药吗?
OK. Now, are you on any medication?

420
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,695
我就涂点药膏
Er... Just some cream.

421
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:10,742
我有两只味较重的香港脚 但也就这样
I've got very aggressive athlete's foot but that's the only thing about me that is.

422
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:14,003
你神经没出过问题吧 比如说恐慌症?
Do you suffer from any nervous conditions, such as panic attacks?

423
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,255
我看起来像得恐慌症的人吗?
Do I look like I suffer from panic attacks?

424
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:19,542
我在洗车场有过一次恐慌症
I've had one panic attack in a car wash.

425
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,837
那么大的风暴 睡不着 老婆也不在
It was a perfect storm of no sleep, no wife,

426
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,673
无情的刷子呼呼地飞向我
and angry brushes whirring towards me.

427
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,768
直到巨型吹风机过来吹时 我还躲在车的脚坑里
By the time the giant hair dryer came on, I was in the footwell.

428
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,435
武器会吓到你吗?
Does the idea of weaponry trouble you?

429
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:38,228
不能... 我在游乐园开过几枪 还赢奖了
Er... no. I've fired several rifles, at fun fairs, and won prizes.

430
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:41,364
但我从没在愤怒中开枪打死一个人或一只猫
But I've never fired one in anger, or at a cat.

431
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:44,571
我们会给你安排战略武器小组
We'll have you fully briefed by the tactical firearms team.

432
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:45,700
好吧
Cool.

433
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:48,362
你进去后我们会和你保持电话联系
We'll keep in regular phone contact with you when you go in.

434
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:50,122
非常好 你是说进去?
Very cool. Sorry, go in?

435
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,749
- 进入大厦?  - 嗯嗯
- What, into the building?  - Mm-hm.

436
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:56,412
- 亲自和派特说话?  - 是的 你不是...
- To speak to Pat in person?  - Yes, is that not what you...

437
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:00,711
- 嗯...  - 你没问题吧?
- Erm...  - Everything OK?

438
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:04,553
要进入洗车场... 进入现场有点紧张
I'm just a little nervous about going into a car wash... er... siege.

439
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:07,427
你怎么想的 阿兰? 你会帮助我们吗?
So what do you say, Al? Will you help us?

440
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,103
当然
Yep.

441
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:21,066
我们都有选择自己...
Guys, none of us choose the hand we're dealt...

442
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,483
- 你知道...  - 我们真心要知道答案
- You know...  - We do need an answer, I'm afraid.

443
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:27,284
你还有别的案子要处理吗?
Do you have another siege to go to?

444
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:30,204
据我理解 你如果说是的话 就能多说几句
It's my understanding that if you say yes, you're allowed a few words.

445
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:32,577
- 所以你说是?  - 这就是我最后想说的
- So you are saying yes?  - I was leaving that to the end.

446
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,367
- 我们一起走吧  - 好的
- If you'd like to come with me.  - Sure.

447
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,535
能给我复制一份吗?
Can I get a copy of that?

448
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:39,296
- 尽量简单化 好吧?  - 明白
- Let's keep this simple, shall we?  - Roger, that.

449
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:41,207
- 不要说什么豪言壮语  - 明白 好兄弟
- No heroics.  - Ten-four, good buddy.

450
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:43,417
不要和他动手
Do not physically engage him.

451
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:46,053
- 看到枪反抗 看到刀逃跑 不是吗?  - 你从哪读的?
- Fight a gun, flee a knife, yeah?  - Where do you read that?

452
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,179
我可是飞行通信部队的超级粉丝
Big fans of you guys in TFU.

453
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,887
要是我自主行事 所有的警察将会带武器
If I had my way, all police officers would carry firearms.

454
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,929
我觉得武器应该归还于专家手中
I think that firearms should remain in the hands of specialists.

455
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:57,314
我也正准备说只有专家才能开枪
I was going to say that only specialists should be allowed to fire them.

456
00:25:57,473 --> 00:26:00,192
如果你认为我是吹的话 那就给我的助理打电话
If you think I've just made that up, you can call my assistant.

457
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,523
阿兰! 听着
Alan! Read my lips.

458
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,939
一旦由于你没听我的而危及到
If you jeopardize the safety of any of my men,

459
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:08,450
我的人或人质的安全
or any of those hostages because you've not been listening to me,

460
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:12,239
我会脱下警服 并让你付出代价的
I will take off this police uniform and I will make you pay for it.

461
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:15,749
你想让我买你脱下的那套警服?
You want me to buy your police uniform off you?

462
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:18,536
不是 我会让你消失 明白吗? 
No. I'll give you a fucking good hiding, is that clear?

463
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,579
明白 太明白了
Yes, that's clear. Yes. That's clear.

464
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:22,840
你离我太近了
You're close to me.

465
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:26,339
你是个聪明人 我知道你能应对
Now, you're a smart bloke, I know you can handle it.

466
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:28,675
- 你不会让我失望的  - 不会的
- I know you won't disappoint me.  - I won't.

467
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:31,636
我会让你满意的 你会记住我的
I aim to please you, and I... I hope to impress you.

468
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:34,469
- 你是好人  - 你也是好人
- Good man.  - Yeah, you're a good man too.

469
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,225
好 唐会给你强调一些细节的
Right, well, Dom will fill you in.

470
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,528
他又会说什么狗屁保险之类的
He has to say all that shit for the insurance.

471
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,405
- 对  - 告诉我
- Right.  - Tell me this much, mate.

472
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,942
- 你最喜欢什么样的围攻?  - 伊朗大使馆那样的
- What's your favourite siege?  - Iranian Embassy.

473
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,235
一样 为什么啊?
Same. Why?

474
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:53,002
因为他们利用风钻的声音
They used the sound of a pneumatic drill

475
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:56,332
来掩盖他们从隔壁墙上移砖的声音
to disguise the noise of them removing bricks from a neighbouring wall.

476
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:59,285
- 这样他们就能打通...  - 打败他们
- So they could smash through and...  - Take them out the game.

477
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,545
多棒的一次围攻
It's just a great siege.

478
00:27:02,663 --> 00:27:03,789
好
Right.

479
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:06,709
想看看我的枪吗?
Do you want to see my gun?

480
00:27:07,084 --> 00:27:09,178
想啊
Does erm... Yes, please.

481
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,474
看谁能先抢到枪
Let's clock the Glock.

482
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,803
你得更快点哦
You'll have to move quicker than that.

483
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,723
- 最后想给你孩子说点啥?  - 哦... 嗯...
- Any last messages for your kids?  - Oh... Er...

484
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,607
没啥说的 他们都不和我说话了 
No, they don't speak to me any more.

485
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,689
你想问"为什么不和我说了?"
Yeah, "Why don't you speak to me any more?"

486
00:27:24,852 --> 00:27:26,399
我也不知道
I wouldn't know the answer, would I?

487
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:30,442
就告诉他们我爱他们吧
So just um... just... tell them I love them.

488
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:40,910
派特 阿兰现在就过去
Pat, Alan's coming in now.

489
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,472
- 格雷格!  - 哦... 嘿 阿兰 谢谢
- Greg!  - Oh... Hey, Alan. Thanks.

490
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:01,559
- 他们也让你去了?  - 总算能出来松口气了
- They let you go as well?  - I'm relieved to be getting out of there.

491
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:04,191
- 那还有女人吗?  - 有...
- Aren't there still women in there?  - Yeah, well...

492
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:07,770
我觉得先让女人出来有点性别歧视
I think it would be a bit sexist to let all the women go out first.

493
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,234
睡个好觉 格雷格
Yeah. Sleep well, Greg.

494
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:11,944
谢谢
Thanks.

495
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:18,493
派特?
Pat?

496
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,243
派特?
Pat?

497
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,290
派特?
Pat?

498
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:35,597
- 准备受死吧  - 我还没准备好呢!
- Prepare to die.  - I'm not ready to!

499
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:38,183
阿兰 没事 没事 是我
Alan, it's OK, it's OK, it's me.

500
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:40,344
是我 派特
It's me, Pat.

501
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,602
天啊 你...
God, you...

502
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:45,187
我觉得滑稽点的衣服能让你放松
I just thought a little jokey costume would, you know, put you at ease,

503
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:48,353
- 让你笑笑  - 你的目的达成了
- give you a giggle.  - Well... mission accomplished.

504
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:50,570
天呐
Oh, God.

505
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,697
- 很高兴见到你  - 我也是
- It's great to see you.  - Good to see you, too.

506
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:55,700
我给你带了点蛋糕 虽然你不值得有
I bought you some cake, not that you deserve it after that.

507
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:58,237
我应该把它捏碎 我已经捏碎了
I should just crush it in my hand. Oh, I already have.

508
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:01,327
- 你怎么这么邪恶?  - 还好 还好
- How the devil are you?  - Yeah, not bad, not bad.

509
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:02,912
你感觉怎样?
How are you feeling?

510
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,748
- 超爽!  - 好
- Great!  - Good.

511
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:07,296
警察让我带来这个
Oh, er... the police told me to bring you this.

512
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:09,127
是个标准电话
It's just a standard field phone,

513
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:12,509
当你想和当局交流时可以用
should you feel the inclination to communicate with the authorities.

514
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:16,138
他们对这些问题和小毛病有免疫力
Good thing about these things, they're immune to the problems and glitches.

515
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:18,390
你可以用卫星电话
You get with satellite phones.

516
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:21,427
但那只是种选择
But, like I say, it's just an option, really.

517
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:27,108
我刚意识到 你问我感觉如何 你的意思是...
I just realised, when you asked me now how I was feeling, you meant...

518
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:29,268
是的
Yes, I did.

519
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:33,280
- 这个能回答你的问题吗?  - 可以
- Does this answer your question?  - Yes, it does.

520
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,532
嗨 你也在这啊
Oh, hello. Didn't see you there.

521
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:37,693
有人奔赴战场了
Someone's been in the wars.

522
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:40,157
- 是赛门  - 他能呼吸吗?
- That's just Simon.  - Can he breathe through that?

523
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,197
当然可以 那只是个面具
Of course. It's just like wearing a mask.

524
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:45,163
当有人给你戴这样一个面具时 你还能说这只
At least when someone puts you in a mask, you've got a safe word,

525
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:47,373
像"安全气囊"或"小龙虾"之类的
like "airbag", or "crayfish".

526
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:50,752
那是什么?
What's the er... That thing?

527
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:53,550
哦 我们自制的 是个脑袋枪托
Oh, we made that. It's a head holster.

528
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:57,430
- 以前没见过这玩意儿  - 我示范一下 赛门?
- Never heard of one of those.  - Yeah, I'll show you. Simon?

529
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:59,848
把枪插进去
You insert the shotgun.

530
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:02,350
- 放在支架上 然后...  - 就可以走开
- Place on stand. And...  - Walk out.

531
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:04,978
就能把手空出来 我就可以为所欲为了
Hands free. I can move around the studio, do anything I want.

532
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:08,266
要是情况不妙... 我可以直接爆他的头
And if something happens... I don't even have to look.

533
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:10,814
看都不看 就能正中目标
Boom. Hit the target.

534
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:13,195
那么... 看来你也不需要帮手了啊
Yeah... well, you don't need an accomplice.

535
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:15,321
你现在在我手上了
Well, I've got you now.

536
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,982
好吧
Yeah.

537
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:19,827
谢谢
Thank you.

538
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:25,328
你跟警察是一伙的?
So you're with the police now?

539
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:29,745
哦 不是这样的...
Oh, this... no, this is just...

540
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,879
只是个标志 拿掉了
I think it's Velcro. There you go.

541
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:33,586
去他妈的警察
Feck the police.

542
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,339
你现在持枪 还劫持了人质
I think they thought that if they did take a pot shot at you

543
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,174
他们可能是觉得像你开枪的话
it's a siege, you've got a gun

544
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:40,510
子弹可能会伤到我
that the bullet might pass through you and hit me.

545
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,925
除非他们用达姆弹 能在体内爆炸成碎片
Unless they use dum-dums, which explode inside the body.

546
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:46,262
我对他们说 不要对派特・法莱尔用达姆弹
I said, do not use dum-dums on Pat Ferrell, Farrell, Ferrell.

547
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:49,227
就用高速子弹 会直接穿透身体的那种
Just use a high-velocity round that passes through his body

548
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:50,933
因为他是我的朋友
because he's a friend of mine.

549
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,943
如果我想开枪的话 我肯定能打爆你的头 
And I suppose if I want to shoot you, I can always aim for the head.

550
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:55,479
没错 没错
Exactly. Exactly.

551
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,940
呃... 我也不知道为什么会穿它
Um... I don't even know why I'm wearing it.

552
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,363
- 那就脱掉  - 我很愿意脱下来
- So take it off.  - I'll happily take it off.

553
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:01,697
那就脱掉
Go on, then.

554
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:04,302
- 你要是希望我脱掉 那我就脱掉  - 赶快脱掉!
- If you want me to, I'll take it off.  - Fucking take it off!

555
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:06,949
派特 你吓得我都不敢脱了
Oh, Pat, now you're making me want to wear it.

556
00:31:07,157 --> 00:31:09,080
不关我的事
This is not my bag.

557
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:10,877
我... 我... 我就是个电台主播
I'm... I'm... I'm... a disc jockey.

558
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:13,004
很抱歉你被解雇了
I'm sorry you got the sack.

559
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:17,418
可我都55岁了 本应该舒服地窝在家里看搞笑视频
I'm 55 years old, I should be at home in bed watching funny videos on YouTube.

560
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:21,429
看"熊猫打喷嚏"或者是"查理咬手指"之类的
"Sneezing Panda" or "Charlie Bit My Finger".

561
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:24,558
你看过"肥婆掉洞"吗?
Have you seen "Fat woman falls down the hole"?

562
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:30,647
- 太搞笑了 你觉得呢?  - 没错
- That's hilarious. Isn't it?  - Yeah.

563
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:32,774
我以前看过 不过...
I've seen it before, but, yeah.

564
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:37,029
那里... 那里应该被围起来的 不过... 围起来就没好戏看了
That... That should be fenced off really, but erm... I'm glad it wasn't.

565
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,026
真搞笑
Great.

566
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:42,151
我想问一下 其他人在哪儿呢?
Oh, yeah, I'm supposed to ask, where are the hostages?

567
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,069
在里边
In there.

568
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,624
天啊!
Oh, my God!

569
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,869
看起来好像电影"决战猩球"里的动物园
That's like some son of zoo from Planet Of The Apes.

570
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,539
丹尼看起来... 挂彩了
Danny looks a bit... bruised.

571
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,749
我中间有两次失控了
I lost my temper a couple of times.

572
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,669
- 三次  - 是啊 他那就是第三次
- Three times.  - Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it was three.

573
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:02,887
去问个好吧
Go and say hello.

574
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:05,890
- 要是你愿意的话 可以和他击个掌  - 不用了...
- Give him a slap yourself, if you want.  - Oh, no...

575
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:09,761
我还是... 问个好就行了
No, I'll just... I'll just say hello.

576
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:13,395
- 阿兰...  - 警察知道我们的位置吗?
- Alan...  - Look, do the police know we're here?

577
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:15,184
阿兰! 这到底是什么情况?
Alan! What the hell's going on?

578
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:19,025
嘿! 安静!
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

579
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:22,278
别跟讲群口相声似的 你们可是专业播音员
Cool it with the cross-talk, you're professional broadcasters.

580
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:25,069
- 不 我是作家  - 我们要共度难关
- I'm not, I'm a writer.  - We'll get through this with each other.

581
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:27,038
大家要相互握手
I want everyone to shake hands with everyone else.

582
00:32:27,051 --> 00:32:28,865
愿不愿意都好 马上握手! 
Now! Whether you want to or not.

583
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,907
太荒谬了
This is ridiculous.

584
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,701
哇哦
Ow.

585
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:34,911
你好... 康纳
Hello, er... Connor.

586
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,257
- 布 我赢了  - 你好
- Paper.  - Hi.

587
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:42,420
听好 派特不想跟警察交谈
OK. Pat will not communicate directly with the police.

588
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:44,634
他只愿意和我交谈
Only through me.

589
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:48,141
现在 我就是传话筒
So as of now, I am bullhorn.

590
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,803
- 不过大家不会有事的  - 不会有事? 他打我!
- But I think we're gonna be OK.  - OK? He hit me!

591
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:54,644
别在纠结谁打了谁 或者谁欠打了 
Let's not get into who hit who or, you know, who may have deserved it.

592
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,854
别让他靠近我 明白没?
You need to keep him away from me. Understand?

593
00:32:57,017 --> 00:32:58,735
丹尼 我要做的是
What I need to do, Danny,

594
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:01,108
跟杰森一起处理这个紧急状况 
in conjunction with Jason, is crisis management.

595
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:03,432
他也一定认为现在危机重重...
I'm sure he'll agree there has been plenty of crisis...

596
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:06,239
- 而且毫无秩序  - 好了 跟着我走
- But no management.  - Cowabunga. Walk with me.

597
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,455
阿兰 你也注意到自己处于有利位置了吧?
Alan, you do realise you're in the box seat here?

598
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:12,036
他信任你
You've got the guy's confidence.

599
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:13,291
是啊 我也不知道为什么
Yeah. I don't know why.

600
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:16,712
我和他每年都会吃一次咖喱饭 尽管我不吃开胃菜
I go for a curry with him once a year, and even then I don't have a starter.

601
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,122
可是他会
Trouble is, he does.

602
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:20,256
我只想确定 你能稳住大局吗?
All I need to know is can you handle it?

603
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,792
这个... 这么说吧
Well, er... put it this way,

604
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:24,586
你会对一个忘了戴护目镜
would you ask that of a man who'd gone paint-balling,

605
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:27,927
却依然淡定玩彩弹游戏的人问这种问题吗?
realised he'd left his goggles at reception but carried on anyway?

606
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:29,678
- 什么意思?  - 那个人就是我
- Why?  - You're looking at him.

607
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:31,848
好了 伙计们 再说几句
OK, guys, quick wa-wa.

608
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,513
可以和杰森讨论一下 不过...
Just had a pow-wow with Jase, upshot is...

609
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,274
这次我来当他的右臂
I'm gonna be his right-hand man on this one.

610
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:40,273
他呢... 是我的左膀
He'll be um... my left-hand man.

611
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,771
- 呃...  - 抱歉
- Er...  - Sorry.

612
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:45,657
关键是 派特并没疯
The point is, Pat has not gone mad.

613
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:48,701
他有苦衷 他需要发泄出来
He has a grievance. He needs some son of outlet.

614
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:55,084
大家好 欢迎收听北诺福克电台的"摇滚吧 法莱尔"节目 我是主播派特・法莱尔
This is Pat Farrell, welcoming you to Roll Out The Farrell on North Norfolk Digital.

615
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:57,627
好吧 派特可能... 可能有点疯了 
OK. Pat may have... may have gone mad.

616
00:33:57,786 --> 00:33:59,834
他可能是疯了
He may have gone mad.

617
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:03,672
下面是来自霍尔特的辛西娅的来信 信中写着
And now we have a text from Cynthia in Holt, who writes,

618
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,551
亲爱的派特 我们给你寄了一瓶...
Dear Pat, we are sending you a bottle...

619
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:08,972
- 长官 你最好听听这个...  - 自家葡萄干酿造的白兰地
- Ma'am, you'd better listen to this.  - Of our homemade plum Brandy.

620
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,098
我们用葡萄干制作白兰地白脱...
We use it to make Brandy butter...

621
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:14,683
- 广播有什么好听的?  - 长官 是派特・法莱尔在播音
- Why am I listening to shit radio?  - That's Pat Farrell, ma'am.

622
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:16,437
他在劫持人质的时候播音
He's broadcasting from the siege.

623
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:19,019
嗯 辛西娅 我都迫不及待了
Mm, yum, Cynthia. Can't wait.

624
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:21,943
你能否稍微提醒一下派特 我们达成的协议吗?
Can you gently remind Pat that we had an agreement?

625
00:34:22,102 --> 00:34:24,070
我们是要你去传话的
You are there to communicate with us.

626
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:27,733
听我说 我不知道警察手册上...
Listen, I don't know what it says in your police operation manual...

627
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,618
- 或者是心里周刊  - 解救人质教程
- or in Psycho-babble Weekly.  - Penguin Book of Sieges.

628
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:32,742
或者解救人质教程是怎么写的
Or The Penguin Book of Sieges,

629
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:35,995
不过今时不同往日
but out here in the field, it's plenty different.

630
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:41,209
这里有个拿着枪的愤怒的家伙 他不许我说话
I've got a guy with a gun and a gripe to grind, and he say, "No speaky."

631
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:44,375
我希望你能让我们建立对话 阿兰
I would really like to establish a dialogue here, Alan.

632
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:47,715
简单的三角对话 派特传话给你 你传话给我 再把我的话传给他
A simple tri-lateral exchange, from Pat, to you, to me, to you, to Pat.

633
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:50,847
- 明白吗?  - 别打断我们!
- Do you understand?  - No more interruptions or else!

634
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:53,680
你以为我没子弹吗? 子弹多着呢!
You think I don't have balls? I've got plenty of balls!

635
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:56,311
老子多得是子弹!
I've got balls coming out of my arse!

636
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,853
- 呃... 你听到了吗?  - 听到了
- Er... did you hear that?  - Yes.

637
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:04,270
好吧... 我要挂断电话了 拜拜
Well, that's... that's the end of the call. Bye.

638
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:08,197
你们正在收听的是北诺福克电台
You are listening to North Norfolk Digital.

639
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:10,863
# 谢普 #
# Shape.#

640
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:12,744
# 您想要的电台 #
# The Way You Want It To Be. #

641
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:15,280
# 您想要的电台 #
# The way you want it to be. #

642
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:18,166
- 怎么不是我的音乐?  - 杰森把它们删掉了
- Where are all my jingles?  - Jason wanted them deleted.

643
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:20,645
- 他没全删掉  - 他已经删掉了
- He won't have deleted them all.  - He did delete them all.

644
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,458
- 他已经全删掉了 派特  - 什么?
- He did delete them all, Pat.  - What?

645
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:25,215
- 你的音乐全没了  - 这么做没用的 赛门
- It was jingle genocide.  - That's not helping, Simon.

646
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:28,297
混蛋 阿兰 替我一会儿
The bastard. Alan, take over for me.

647
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,550
- 不要啊  - 我要跟他算账
- No.  - I'm gonna straighten him out.

648
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:35,475
哦 还有... 说些小清新的话题 
Oh, and... keep it light.

649
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:38,144
好吧 呃...
Right, um... OK.

650
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:40,726
你正在收听的是派特和阿兰共同播出的节目
You're listening to the Pat and Alan Show.

651
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:43,184
- 主播是派特  - 杰森 你给我出来
- Mainly Pat.  - You, Jason. Yeah, you.

652
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:46,024
我们会问... 什么时候...
We'll be asking... w... what time...

653
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:52,902
麦克・培波将开关...
does Mike Paper slider switch to... to...

654
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:56,914
调到他的巧克力杯?
to mouse his chocolate cups?

655
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:59,291
- 话说八道什么呢  - 这简直就是胡话
- It doesn't make sense.  - It doesn't make sense

656
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:04,247
不过要是你重新组织一下 你就会发现... 垃圾箱... 
but if you can rearrange to make sense then you could win... bins...

657
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,335
还会发现...
and win...

658
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:07,499
窗户
and windows.

659
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:10,886
- 阿兰 救我!  - 发现垃圾箱还有窗户
- Alan, help me!  - So that's our win a bin and window,

660
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:13,839
重新组织一下句子 别多想 就是竞争
re-arrange the sentence, keep it light, competition.

661
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,508
妈的
Oh, shit.

662
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:19,136
下面送上"周日滑雪"的主题曲
This is the theme from Ski Sunday.

663
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:20,846
抱歉说脏话了
Sorry for swearing.

664
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:29,271
我已经忍受你这样的混蛋大半辈子了...
I've put up with shits like you for most of my life...

665
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:39,660
给你一小时
One hour.

666
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:44,077
要是跟我要的音乐有一点差别的话
And if that jingle isn't word for word what I just said,

667
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:48,715
我要让你的脚 膝盖 手依次尝尝中弹的滋味
I am going to shoot you in the feet, then the knees, then the hands.

668
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:53,216
凡是你长了一对的部位都得挨枪 比如你的脸
And basically anything you've got two of, like your face.

669
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:56,177
懂了 两面派 
Oh, yeah. Two-faced.

670
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,387
只有一个小时
One hour.

671
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:05,850
一个小时? 根本不可能 我要挂了
One hour? This is impossible. I'm gonna fucking die.

672
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,767
我们该怎么办?
What are we gonna do?

673
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:09,902
一个小时根本就做不出来高质量的音律
You can't do a top-quality jingle in an hour.

674
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:13,065
我们可以的 听我讲个故事...
We can do this. Let me tell you a story, um...

675
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:16,610
以前 我主持过雷纳德医药公司的一个会议
Back in the day, I was MC-ing a conference for Reynard Pharmaceuticals.

676
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:19,321
有些市场部的人在唱K
Some of the marketing guys were doing karaoke.

677
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:22,161
我没加入他们 我有些抵触日本文化
I didn't join in, I tended to shun Japanese culture.

678
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,667
当时是90年代中期 它已经被认可了
This was the mid-90s, it was more acceptable.

679
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:27,921
但是鸡尾酒 香槟还有啤酒下肚后 我就喝嗨了
But high on a cocktail of champagne and cheap Fosters lager,

680
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,002
我对着麦克狂吼
I lunged at the microphone.

681
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:32,418
几分钟后 有几个老人被我演奏的
A few minutes later, I was making grown men cry

682
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:35,554
布莱恩・亚当斯的"69年的夏天"给感动哭了
with my rendition of Summer Of '69 by Bryan Adams.

683
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,594
关键是 我把歌词改编成了"29年的夏天"
Thing is, I twisted the lyrics to the Summer Of '29,

684
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:42,098
说的是29年华尔街危机和德国紧张局势
evoking memories of the Wall Street Crash and German hyperintion.

685
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:46,106
- 记住 这些家伙是搞销售的  - 阿兰 你到底要说什么?
- Remember, these guys were in sales.  - Alan, where are you going with this?

686
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:48,608
他的重点是 他以为自己不擅长唱歌
The point is, he didn't think he was any good at singing,

687
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:50,610
结果证明他唱歌还是可以的
and it turns out he was quite good.

688
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:53,067
- 没错  - 如果拼尽全力的话
- Yeah, that.  - And that if you really, really try

689
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,697
- 一切皆有可能  - 正是如此
- you can do anything.  - And that.

690
00:37:54,856 --> 00:37:57,405
我才不管呢! 老子都要挂了!
I don't care! I'm going to fucking die!

691
00:37:57,609 --> 00:38:01,034
嘿 我可是在试着拯救你的脑袋 肩膀 膝盖 还有脚趾
Hey, hey, I'm trying to save your head, shoulders, knees and toes.

692
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:04,325
- 膝盖和脚趾  - 大家快行动起来
- Knees and toes.  - OK, man up, musos.

693
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:06,994
- 我曾在一个爵士乐队演奏电音  - 太好了 还有谁会的?
- I played synth in a jazz funk band.  - Great, who else?

694
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,128
我曾经在海狮合唱团当鼓手
I used to be the drummer in Marillion.

695
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,381
真的? 没时间纠结这些了
Really? There's no time for that.

696
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:14,133
- 不过还是很惊讶  - 我们从哪儿做起?
- But wow and great.  - What are you gonna do first?

697
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:20,385
我去调音轨
I'm gonna lay down a rhythm track.

698
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,315
哦
Oh.

699
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:32,148
琳・本菲尔德在吗?
Lynn Benfield?

700
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,154
- 我就是  - 你认识阿兰・帕屈吉先生吗?
- I am she.  - Do you know Mr. Alan Partridge?

701
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,690
好吧
OK.

702
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:38,574
他并没有偷拿薯片
He wasn't stealing crisps.

703
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:41,031
只是他在自助付款时有点发慌 
He just gets flustered at self-service checkouts

704
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:43,822
- 下意识随手拿了东西  - 本菲尔德女士...
- and takes things without scanning them.  - Miss Benfield...

705
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:47,913
他不喜欢听机器人的指挥 把东西放在寄存区
He doesn't like being told to put things in bagging areas by automated women.

706
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:50,670
你误会了 本菲尔德女士 我来找你是因为
No, Miss Benfield, we're here because Mr. Partridge is

707
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,668
帕屈吉先生卷入了一场持枪劫持案件
currently involved in an armed siege.

708
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:55,758
- 天啊  - 我们通知你 因为你是他的近亲
- Oh.  - We're informing you as his next of kin.

709
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,175
带我去见他
Take me to him.

710
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:05,601
# 派特・法莱尔忠心耿耿 #
# Pat Farrell had a loyal following in #

711
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:08,517
# 对待广播公司 #
# The local community #

712
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:11,646
# 但格尔戴尔传媒解雇了他 #
# But Goredale Media fucked him over #

713
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:14,903
# 因为他们对忠诚不屑一顾 #
# Because they don't care about loyalty #

714
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:18,106
# 他们关心的只有一个 #
# The only things they give a shit about #

715
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:20,947
# 就是追逐利润 #
# Is the profit margins #

716
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:24,200
# 要是他们不重新任用他 #
# And if they don't re-instate him #

717
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:27,206
# 他将会对人质下手 #
# He'll take it out on the hostages #

718
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:29,785
# 不管你是否拖家带口 #
# Even the ones with kids #

719
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:32,921
# 自求多福吧 #
# Better get yourself some body bags #

720
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:38,050
真好听 
That was beautiful.

721
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,428
- 能再制作长点的吗?  - 哦 呃...
- Could you make me some more?  - Ooh. Er...

722
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:43,264
- 当然可以!  - 应该可以
- Definitely!  - Yes, maybe.

723
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:50,563
民族三重奏"鬼火"乐队今晚无法演出了
Local folk trio Will'o-the-wisp won't be coming in now.

724
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:54,352
显然 警察在诺维奇设置了路障...
Apparently, there are road closures in Norwich due to a major police...

725
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:56,937
让你久等了 本菲尔德小姐
Thanks for waiting, Miss Benfield.

726
00:39:57,103 --> 00:40:00,152
我们正尽力了解派特・法莱尔这个人
We're speaking to anyone who can help us build a picture of Pat Farrell.

727
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:01,908
- 你认识他吗?  - 算认识吧...
- You said you know him?  - Ah, well...

728
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,615
去年 我给他做过三个蛋糕
I made three cakes for him over the last year.

729
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:07,705
不过蛋糕里没有东西能让他变成现在这样
But there was nothing in them that would have led him to do this.

730
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:09,439
那些就是普通的蛋糕
They were very plain.

731
00:40:09,452 --> 00:40:11,212
我们不是要调查这件事
That's not one of our lines of investigation.

732
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:13,244
告诉我们你对派特了解多少
Just tell us what you know about Pat.

733
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:16,039
爱尔兰人 褐色卷发
Irish. Shock of brown, curly hair.

734
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:20,176
他很健壮 手臂强壮有力 腿脚也不错
He's a strong man, with strong arms and a good walk. Moves well.

735
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:22,761
- 这些很有帮助 琳  - 是吗
- That's very helpful, Lynn.  - Oh.

736
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:24,923
- 谢啦  - 想来杯咖啡吗?
- Thank you.  - Now, how about some coffee?

737
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,057
好的 去哪里拿?
Oh, of course. How do you take it?

738
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:30,436
我们给你端过来 你在这里等着就行 我去去就回
No, no, we'll get it for you. Just sit there, I'll be back.

739
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,267
哦...
Oh...

740
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:40,484
我讨厌这些东西 竟然教我们怎样讲话
I hate all this shit. Telling us how to speak.

741
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:43,116
他们以为能让我们与众不同 但这种做法...
They think they're giving us an identity but they're...

742
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:44,867
只能让我们默默无闻
Turning us into nobodies.

743
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:47,154
对于那些只认钱的人 我们就是机器
We're just unit-shifters for the money men.

744
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,197
没错
Sounds quite good.

745
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:56,921
阿兰 你曾经想过50岁以后的生活吗?
Alan, did you ever imagine what life would be like in your 50s?

746
00:40:57,205 --> 00:40:59,879
我曾经有梦想 我想每个人都有
I had hopes and dreams. I think we all did.

747
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,635
梦想不值钱
Penny for them.

748
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:05,217
别提钱了 你手里有枪呢
Keep the penny, you've got a gun.

749
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:08,975
不过 我曾经梦想有一天我开着全新的越野车
But, yeah, I used to dream that one day I'd drive a brand-new Range Rover

750
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,976
拖着快艇跑
towing a speed boat.

751
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:14,309
我曾经梦想跟自己爱的人厮守到老
I used to dream about growing old with someone I love.

752
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,982
都不错
Hm. Both valid.

753
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,235
不会实现了 
It's not gonna happen now, is it?

754
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:26,864
我好想我的茉莉
I miss my Molly so much.

755
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,999
- 这家伙是谁?  - 他就是茉莉
- Who's this chap?  - That's Molly.

756
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,376
没错 当然了
Yes, of course.

757
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:40,624
她的头发... 颜色真深 
She's got such... brown hair.

758
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:46,884
拍完这张照片一年后 天使把她带走了
A year after that was taken, the angels took her.

759
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,551
她一定也是天使
Must have been a few of them.

760
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:54,642
现在我一无所有 没老婆
Now I've nobody. No wife.

761
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,440
没家庭 没孩子
No family. No kids.

762
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:04,735
不得不说 派特 孩子不会让你开心起来的
I've gotta say, Pat, kids don't make you happy.

763
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:08,151
我生命中最惨的几次遭遇 都跟我的孩子有关
Some of the unhappiest times of my life have been with my kids.

764
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:10,365
我记得...
I remember...

765
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:13,407
一次在普里斯坦丁海滨度假
a holiday on the beach in Prestatyn.

766
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:18,287
孩子们跑过来对我说 "爸爸 爸爸! 跟我来"
The kids came over to me and said, "Papa, Papa! Follow me."

767
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:20,547
然后... 你能猜到吧...
and... you know...

768
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:23,918
我跟着他们沿着沙丘走了200多码
I followed them about 200 yards across the sand dunes.

769
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:28,008
等到了才发现 他们只不过是挖了个大坑而已
When I got there, finally, all they'd done was dug a big hole.

770
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,390
悲惨经历
Miserable.

771
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,604
挺有爱的
Sounds lovely.

772
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:03,039
早上好!
Go-o-o-od morning!

773
00:43:03,206 --> 00:43:05,129
龙虾!
Crayfish!

774
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:08,420
感觉真爽
I feel absolutely great.

775
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:11,715
睡个好觉 洗个热水澡感觉真好
There's a lot to be said for a good sleep and a hot shower.

776
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:13,799
是啊 
Yeah.

777
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,686
睡得好吗 阿兰?
Sleep well, Alan?

778
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,314
呃... 还好 谢了
Er... yes, thank you.

779
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:22,559
劫持事件已经过了一天
As the Shape siege enters its first morning,

780
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,272
警察还是不肯透露
police are refusing to confirm

781
00:43:24,477 --> 00:43:26,571
被解雇的前主播派特・法莱尔
the number or identities of the hostages

782
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:28,402
持枪劫持的
still being held at gunpoint

783
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,404
人质的数目和身份
by sacked DJ, Pat Farrell.

784
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:32,201
他的同事阿兰・帕屈吉
Fellow DJ Alan Partridge

785
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,737
跟警察保持联系
is in contact with the police

786
00:43:33,903 --> 00:43:36,201
警察已在我身后的学校里设立指挥所
who are now set up at the school behind me.

787
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:38,366
你想点播什么歌 埃利斯?
What would you like us to play, Iris?

788
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:40,160
威利・纳尔逊的"永远在我心上"
Always On My Mind by Willie Nelson.

789
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:41,418
好歌
Aw.

790
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:45,207
我也想为你播这首歌 但不幸的是 这首歌不在系统里
I would love to, Iris, but unfortunately that's not in the system.

791
00:43:45,373 --> 00:43:48,047
我们只能播允许播出的歌曲
We are only allowed play-approved tracks.

792
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:51,554
但派特 你有枪 你可以放随便什么歌
But, Pat, you've got a gun. You can play whatever you like.

793
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:54,261
交给我 我来想办法 好吗?
Leave it with me and I'll see what I can do, OK?

794
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:57,806
还记得当年我们自己选要播什么歌吗?
Remember we used to choose our own records?

795
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:02,065
记得 如果嫌麻烦不想挑的时候 就放上张混合版的专辑
Yeah. Or put on a compilation album if you were tired or couldn't be bothered.

796
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:04,066
是呀
Yeah.

797
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:06,193
你喜欢乡村音乐吗 阿兰?
You like country music, Alan?

798
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:07,979
不怎么喜欢 派特
Can't say I do, Pat.

799
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:11,657
那只是被抛弃的苦情人边喝酒边抱怨而已
It's just jilted spouses complaining whilst drunk.

800
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:14,159
如果你超过40岁了 那这也算是约会
Also known as a date, if you're over 40.

801
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,946
如果听众点的歌我没有
When a listener asks for a song and I don't have it,

802
00:44:17,113 --> 00:44:19,207
我感觉是自己让他们失望了
I feel like I've let them down.

803
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,376
威利・纳尔逊也是茉莉的最爱
And Willie Nelson was Molly's favourite too.

804
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:25,960
"永远在我心上"也正是她最喜欢的歌曲
And Always On My Mind was her favourite song.

805
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:37,888
还记得吗? 这辆路演车
Do you remember that? The old road show bus.

806
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:40,303
你记得吗? 我带着家里人在里面露营过
Remember it? I took my family camping in that.

807
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:42,437
- 真的?  - 那九天真是艰难
- Yeah?  - That was a tough nine days.

808
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:45,437
要知道 这辆车给很多人带去过欢乐
You see, this bus brought joy to hundreds.

809
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,102
不知道这车现在在哪儿
I wonder where it is now.

810
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:50,021
可能在撞过童子军之后 就被送去销毁了吧
Probably impounded after it crushed those scouts.

811
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:52,065
不 没有 就停在地下室呢
No, no, it's in the basement.

812
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:53,278
- 真的?  - 当然
- Oh?  - Yeah.

813
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:55,409
- 我可不知道  - 我过去... 哦!
- Did not know that.  - I used... Oh!

814
00:44:55,568 --> 00:44:58,367
- 忘了拿碟 你帮我拿一下吧?  - 好的
- Forgot the record. Hold that, will you?  - Sure.

815
00:45:09,999 --> 00:45:12,093
- 把枪给我 阿兰  - 考虑下
- Give me the gun, Alan.  - Yeah.

816
00:45:14,587 --> 00:45:17,215
- 把枪给我 阿兰  - 我之前在看自己的衣服
- The gun, Alan.  - I was looking at my clothes before.

817
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:20,555
有些人管这个叫装备 是吧? 有些人还说是造型
Some people call it gear, don't they? Others call it an outfit.

818
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:22,595
但我觉得就是破衣服!
But I call it clobber!

819
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:25,681
天啊!
Jesus!

820
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:27,441
阿兰! 阿兰!
Alan! Alan!

821
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:29,565
阿兰! 阿兰 把枪给我!
Alan! Alan, give me the gun!

822
00:45:29,769 --> 00:45:32,067
- 武装警察 站着别动!  - 把枪给我
- Armed police, stay where you are!  - Give me the gun.

823
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:33,482
把枪放下!
Drop the weapon!

824
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:37,531
阿兰!
Alan!

825
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:39,988
阿兰 快开门
Alan, open the door.

826
00:45:40,196 --> 00:45:43,291
我只是在找逃出去的路
I'm just trying to find some way to escape.

827
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:44,496
阿兰! 阿兰!
Alan! Alan!

828
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:48,833
冲啊!
Ayatollah!

829
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:53,668
他有猎枪
He's got a shooter.

830
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:58,551
啊!
Aargh!

831
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:03,765
- 你没事吧 阿兰?  - 我没事
- You all right, Alan?  - Yeah, I'm fine.

832
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:05,430
抱我 警官!
Cuddle me, cop!

833
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,272
啊!
Argh!

834
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,058
目标中枪
Target down.

835
00:46:09,225 --> 00:46:10,977
我想这是你的
Yours, I believe.

836
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:13,737
我抱你的时候 你大概会认为我是基佬吧
You probably thought I was gay when I gave you that cuddle.

837
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:15,273
别担心 我不是
Don't worry, I'm not.

838
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,942
- 你真棒 阿兰  - 没错 我们觉得你棒极了
- You're really cool, Alan.  - Yeah, we think you're cool.

839
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:20,862
谢谢 抱歉 你们是谁?
Thank you. Sorry, who are you?

840
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:23,865
杰森・斯坦森(著名演员)
Jason Statham.

841
00:46:24,073 --> 00:46:25,290
杰森・伯恩("谍影重重"主角)
Jason Bourne.

842
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:27,543
杰森・阿格诺
Jason Argonaut.

843
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:30,584
- 杰森・阿格诺?  - 没错
- Jason Argonaut?  - Mm.

844
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:33,340
- 是杰森和阿格诺吧  - 没错
- It's Jason and the Argonauts.  - Yes.

845
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:34,671
你没事吧?
Are you all right?

846
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:38,805
你刚说了"破衣服" 然后说了"杰森和阿格诺"
You just said, "clobber" and then "Jason and the Argonauts".

847
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:41,933
- 抱歉  - 好吧
- Oh, sorry.  - All right.

848
00:46:42,091 --> 00:46:44,185
- 我们走吧?  - 好的
- We go?  - Yeah.

849
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:47,188
呃... 顺便说一句 谢谢你没拿枪
Oh, er... by the way, thanks for not taking the gun.

850
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:48,768
噢... 别客气
Oh... that's fine.

851
00:46:49,098 --> 00:46:51,942
我是你们的主播派特・法莱尔 接下来播放威利・纳尔逊的
You're listening to Pat Farrell. This is Willie Nelson,

852
00:46:52,143 --> 00:46:54,145
"永远在我心上"
Always On My Mind.

853
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:57,607
献给我的前妻茉莉 你永远在我心上
For someone who's always on my mind, my late wife Molly.

854
00:46:58,024 --> 00:47:01,119
# 也许我对你的爱不够 #
# Maybe I didn't love you #

855
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:07,496
# 常常忽略了你 #
# Quite as often as I could have #

856
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:14,841
# 也许我待你不够好... #
# Maybe I didn't treat you... #

857
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:21,005
- 你觉得那照片看着有59岁?  - 我没看
- Does that man look 59 to you?  - I didn't look.

858
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:24,346
- 我就谷歌了一下他的名字  - 这才是派特・法莱尔
- I just put his name into Google Images.  - This is Pat Farrell.

859
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:28,305
那是个明星 难道事事都要我亲力亲为?
That is a Pat Farrell. Do I have to do everything?

860
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:30,890
长官 你最好听听这个
Ma'am, you better hear this.

861
00:47:31,057 --> 00:47:33,185
这是他们播音的内容
It's taken from the transcript of the broadcast.

862
00:47:31,057 --> 00:47:33,185
第100小时 帕屈吉说:
At 100 hours. Partridge:

863
00:47:35,478 --> 00:47:38,573
这事儿要发生在国外就好了 那简直就是一集精彩的"异域惊魂"
I wish this was abroad because it would make a brilliant Banged Up Abroad.

864
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:40,199
法莱尔说: 什么是"异域惊魂"?
Farrell: What's Banged Up Abroad?

865
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:43,487
- 帕屈吉说: 你不知道"异域惊魂"?  - 法莱尔说: 不知道
- Partridge: You don't know Banged Up Abroad?  - Farrell: No.

866
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:45,575
帕屈吉说: 大家都知道"异域惊魂"
Partridge: Everyone knows Banged Up Abroad.

867
00:47:45,738 --> 00:47:47,991
法莱尔说: 我就不知道 什么是"异域惊魂"?
Farrell: I don't. What is Banged Up Abroad?

868
00:47:48,157 --> 00:47:50,660
帕屈吉说: 你真的不知道"异域惊魂"?
Partridge: You seriously don't know Banged Up Abroad?

869
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:52,043
肯定是在开玩笑吧
You have to be shitting me.

870
00:47:52,203 --> 00:47:53,796
法莱尔说: 我从没听说过...
Farrell: I've never even heard of...

871
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:57,299
直接跳过他们说"异域惊魂"这段
Just get to the bit where they stop saying Banged Up Abroad.

872
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:04,174
助手赛门说: 有一次 我就折断了一块板
Sidekick Simon: I once banged up a broad.

873
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:07,469
帕屈吉说: 哪怕有把枪指着你脑袋 你也才想出这么点笑料?
Partridge: That's the best you've got, even with a gun to your head?

874
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:09,979
他拿枪指着他脑袋
He's got a gun to his head.

875
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:13,687
我记得有次下午我翘班回家 赶过来的时候
I remember once coming to in a skip in the middle of the afternoon

876
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:15,476
嘴里叼着我的内裤
with my underpants in my mouth.

877
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:18,528
然后意识到 "哦 这不是我的裤子!"
And then I realize, "Oh, these are not my pants!"

878
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:22,863
我现在倒是能一笑以对了 但当时...
Oh, I can laugh about it now but, you know, back then...

879
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:26,367
轻点 轻点 是什么声音?
Sssh, ssh. What's that?

880
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:29,665
正在就位 完毕
Move into position, over.

881
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:32,039
是警察
It's the police.

882
00:48:32,201 --> 00:48:35,375
如果你喜欢自助小电影 那就挖到宝了
If you like canapés that are on the turn, we've hit the motherload.

883
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:39,174
长方形的盘子 方形的碗 自己想想 圆的都去哪儿了?
Oblong plate, square bowl. Go figure. Whatever happened to circles?

884
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:41,711
虽然我听说过"饱餐一顿"的说法 但太可笑了
I mean I've heard of a square meal but that's ridiculous.

885
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:43,921
我刚在说我听说过"饱餐一顿"
I was just saying I've heard of a square meal.

886
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:45,590
阿兰! 阿兰! 别说话
Alan! Alan! Ssh, ssh.

887
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:46,882
好吧
OK.

888
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:49,185
- 我们觉得是警察  - 等等
- We think it's the police.  - Wait.

889
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:52,805
- 肯定是从这里发出的声音  - 只是个柜子
- That definitely came from in there.  - That's just a cupboard.

890
00:48:52,972 --> 00:48:54,690
- 连面墙都不算  - 小心点
- It's not even an outside wall.  - Careful.

891
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:57,227
- 别 杰森...  - 我会保护你的
- No, Jason...  - I'll protect you.

892
00:48:57,435 --> 00:49:00,985
不是外面的声音 看 我拉开了
It's not an outside wall. Look, I'll show you. Look.

893
00:49:03,149 --> 00:49:04,992
- 麦克?  - 你好呀 帕屈吉先生
- Michael?  - Aye, aye, Mister Partridge.

894
00:49:05,151 --> 00:49:06,573
你躲在这里面干嘛?
What are you hiding in there for?

895
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:09,864
就跟演习的时候一样 我找了块地方藏起来
I found myself a place of concealment, like when I was on manoeuvres.

896
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:12,871
把头灯关了 否则我们都得亮瞎了
Take your light off. You're blinding everyone you speak to.

897
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:14,501
- 变成闪烁灯了  - 抱歉
- Now it's ?ashing.  - Sorry.

898
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:19,257
麦克 你看上去就像大号矿工版的安妮・弗兰克
Michael. You look like some sort of big Geordie Anne Frank.

899
00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:21,585
- 你在里面待了多久?  - 一整晚
- How long have you been here?  - All night.

900
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,351
- 你吃了什么?  - 我带了午餐盒
- What did you eat?  - I had me lunch box.

901
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:25,134
- 那上厕所呢?  - 不是吧
- Where did you go to the toilet?  - No.

902
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:27,173
午餐盒呀
I had me lunch box.

903
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:29,717
谢天谢地 这盒子总算能锁住那气味
Thank God it's got a smoky finish with an airtight seal.

904
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:31,768
要我说 这盒子能锁住新鲜
I tell you what. It seals in the freshness.

905
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:34,097
不 麦克 新鲜的都在盒子外头
No, Michael. It seals out the freshness.

906
00:49:34,263 --> 00:49:35,810
发生了什么事?
What is going on in here?

907
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:38,226
麦克刚从柜子出来拜访我们
Michael's just visiting us from the cupboard.

908
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:39,609
不用大呼小叫的
No need to get shouty-shouty.

909
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:42,066
是那些格尔戴尔的混蛋让你这么做的吗?
Did those Goredale bastards put you up to this?

910
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:44,903
- 不  - 没有 我在里面住了好几晚了
- No.  - No, no. I've been in here a few nights.

911
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:46,783
- 不 就一晚  - 不 有好几晚
- No, one night.  - No, a few nights.

912
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:48,785
这星期几晚 上星期也住了几晚
A few nights this week and the week before.

913
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:51,038
- 为什么?  - 我哥哥想独霸那张床
- Why?  - Me brother wanted the bed to himself.

914
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:53,120
没错 麦克经常做噩梦
Ah, yes. Michael suffers from night terrors.

915
00:49:53,282 --> 00:49:54,875
刚才就像条大三文鱼那样在柜子里扭来扭去
He thrashes about like a big salmon.

916
00:49:55,034 --> 00:49:56,377
盒子里是什么?
What's in the box?

917
00:49:57,203 --> 00:50:00,127
呃... 麦克他... 让自己失望了
Er... Michael... Michael let himself down.

918
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:05,465
非常抱歉 我在盒子里拉了坨屎
I'm really sorry. I done a shit in the box.

919
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:08,722
那快丢掉 从窗户扔出去
Well, get rid of it. Throw it out the window.

920
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:13,761
退后! 退后!
Fall back! Fall back!

921
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,852
武装警察!
Armed police!

922
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:19,858
- 报上名来!  - 报上名来!
- Identify yourself!  - Identify yourself!

923
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:23,063
阿兰・帕屈吉 真他妈... 我是阿兰・帕屈吉!
Alan Partridge. Who the f... Alan Partridge!

924
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:25,778
你们都知道我是谁 刚才电视上还播过我呢
You know who I am. I haven't been off the TV that long.

925
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:29,069
- "报上名来"  - 阿兰 没事了 我来了 你安全了
- "Identify yourself."  - Alan, it's OK, I'm here. You're safe.

926
00:50:29,235 --> 00:50:31,488
好吧 让他们别拿枪指着我了
Yeah, tell them to stop pointing their guns at me.

927
00:50:31,654 --> 00:50:34,658
- 放下武器  - 没错 放下武器
- Lower your weapons.  - Yeah, lower your weapons.

928
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:39,120
把手从枪上拿开 把手从枪上拿开
Take your hand off your gun. Take your hand off your gun.

929
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:41,664
还有另外一只手 我有的是时间等
And the other hand. I can wait here all day.

930
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:43,374
照他说的做
Do as he says.

931
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:46,135
谢谢 你们干嘛老要我逼你们呢?
Thank you. Why do you have to turn it into a competition?

932
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:48,512
我总能赢的 好吧
Just because I won. OK.

933
00:50:48,671 --> 00:50:50,344
好了 派特 别扯了
OK. Stop. Pat, stop tugging me.

934
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:52,349
我跟你说过 我肚子很敏感的
I told you I've got a very sensitive tummy.

935
00:50:52,508 --> 00:50:53,680
你在和谁说话 阿兰?
Who are you talking to, Alan?

936
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:55,890
这根绳子和耳机的那头就是派特
I've got Pat on the end of the line in both senses.

937
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:58,772
这根绳子另一头拴着大楼 而这个艺术级的
I'm tethered to the building via this rope and relaying messages

938
00:50:58,931 --> 00:51:02,231
森海塞尔1000耳机另一头的 就是派特
from Pat via this state-of-the-art Sennheiser 1,000 head set.

939
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:04,441
这装备不错的 对 我正在跟他们说呢
Nice bit of kit. Yeah, I'm telling them that now.

940
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:06,651
你听着的话 也应该知道我在跟他们说呢
If you'd listened, you'd know I'm telling them.

941
00:51:06,814 --> 00:51:10,318
- 派特说"你好"  - 你好 派特
- Pat says "Hi".  - Hi, Pat.

942
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:12,578
他和所有警官打招呼呢
And hi to your fellow officers.

943
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:15,163
你好 派特
Hi. Hi, Pat.

944
00:51:15,364 --> 00:51:19,460
阿兰 听着 只要派特跟我们合作 事情就会完满解决的 好吗?
Alan, listen. Pat works with us here, this can all end well. OK?

945
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:21,179
- 我保证  - 等等... 好
- I give him my word.  - OK, just... Yep.

946
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:23,456
好了 派特 你得... 太笼统了
OK. Pat, you've got to... you're rambling.

947
00:51:23,664 --> 00:51:25,177
你得说得简洁一点 你要什么?
You've got to be more concise. What do you want?

948
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:26,713
"我要直升机"
"I want a helicopter."

949
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:29,011
那只是打个比方
That's just an example, by the way.

950
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:31,884
好吧 他要直升机
Yeah, OK. He wants a helicopter.

951
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:34,217
那可能性不大 阿兰
That might not be possible, Alan.

952
00:51:34,383 --> 00:51:37,057
但总算是开始交流了 我们还能为他做什么?
But let's dialogue. What else can we do for him?

953
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:47,066
派特说 "一帮蠢猪 到底是怎么回事?"
Pat says, "Fucking stupid pigs. What the hell's going on?"

954
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:50,199
派特 听着 那不是突袭 好吗?
Pat, listen to me. That was not an attack, OK?

955
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:53,827
我们只是用可控制的手段销毁了角落的一个盒子
We just had to dispose of a box around the corner in a controlled manner.

956
00:51:54,028 --> 00:51:56,229
派特希望你能通过我跟他交谈 我也是
Pat would prefer it if you spoke through me, as would I.

957
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:59,833
马汀说他们刚才用装了干扰器的遥控机器人
Martin says they deployed a remote RV fitted with a disruptor

958
00:51:59,992 --> 00:52:02,045
销毁了一个疑似炸弹的东西 他不懂
to neutralise a suspected IED. He doesn't know

959
00:52:02,058 --> 00:52:04,122
你在说什么 他很生气
what you're talking about. He's quite angry.

960
00:52:04,288 --> 00:52:06,089
他正像只生气的爱尔兰鹅一样对我大喊大叫
He's honking in my ear like a mad Irish goose.

961
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:09,293
啊! 我们爱你 阿兰!
Aha! We love you, Alan!

962
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,929
能不能别这样? 现在不是广播台路演
Um... do you mind? It's not a radio road show.

963
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:15,512
- 我在尝试着解救人质  - 我们爱你 阿兰!
- I'm trying to host a siege here.  - We love you, Alan!

964
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:18,223
散了吧 谁说的?
Get away. Who said that?

965
00:52:18,594 --> 00:52:19,811
里面是什么情况?
What's it like in there?

966
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:23,850
恐怖 紧张 大喊大叫
Ah... scary, stressful, lots of shouting.

967
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:27,107
感觉就像又结婚了一样
A bit like being married again.

968
00:52:27,603 --> 00:52:30,026
里面有个疯子拿着枪跑来跑去
And there's a crazy person running around with a gun.

969
00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:33,113
所以更像又结婚了的样子
So it's a lot like being married again.

970
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:38,702
如果... 等我看到一个家伙把枪塞嘴里 乞求宽恕的时候
And er... when I saw a guy with a shotgun in his mouth begging for mercy then...

971
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:40,954
那你们都超前了
you're ahead of me.

972
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:42,596
你们好多人都超前了
You're ahead of me. A lot of you are.

973
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:45,542
他还把手放在枪上呢 他以为我不知道 说的就是你
He's still got his hand on his gun. He thinks I don't know. Yeah, you.

974
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:47,957
- 我在用间接视力看着你呢  - 阿兰
- I'm looking at you. Peripheral vision.  - Alan.

975
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:50,467
我不是在撤退 是派特要把我拉回去了
I'm not retreating, Pat's tugging me off.

976
00:52:50,626 --> 00:52:51,843
别笑了
No, come on.

977
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:54,630
- 说真的 大家被这么幼稚了  - 阿兰 等等!
- We're better than that. Guys, seriously.  - Alan, wait!

978
00:52:54,797 --> 00:52:57,641
顺便说一句 多了个人质 本该告诉你们的
By the way, there's an extra hostage. Meant to tell you that.

979
00:53:02,346 --> 00:53:04,599
事件发生惊人发展 主播阿兰・帕屈吉
In a surprise development, DJ Alan Partridge

980
00:53:04,765 --> 00:53:07,894
出现在广播电台 腰上系着根绳子
appeared outside the building, while tethered to a rope.

981
00:53:08,102 --> 00:53:12,152
这段视频已经一跃成为继"肥婆掉洞"之后
Footage of his address is already one of the most viewed Youtube videos

982
00:53:12,356 --> 00:53:14,450
Youtube上点击量最大的视频之一
since "Fat Woman Falls Down Hole".

983
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:16,531
帕屈吉先生的脸书主页上
Mr. Partridge, whose Facebook page

984
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:19,243
写着他的兴趣之一就是徒手格斗
lists one of his interests as hand-to-hand combat,

985
00:53:19,405 --> 00:53:23,831
而他现在也充当着警方和劫匪派特・法莱尔间的沟通中间人
has been acting as mediator between police and the hostage-taker, Pat Farrell.

986
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:27,792
可能其他国家的人会问 阿兰・帕屈吉是谁?
As people around the world ask, who is Alan Partridge?

987
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:31,250
那可是重磅发言
That was a majestic voice.

988
00:53:31,417 --> 00:53:33,971
可以保留耶稣 但在我看来
You can keep Jesus. As far as I'm concerned,

989
00:53:33,984 --> 00:53:36,548
尼尔・戴蒙德永远是犹太人之王
Neil Diamond will always be King of the Jews.

990
00:53:36,714 --> 00:53:38,261
您正在收听的是...
You are listening to...

991
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:41,139
# 帕屈吉和偷猎者 #
# The Partridge and the Poacher #

992
00:53:42,511 --> 00:53:46,857
我相信这是世界首例 我 阿兰・帕屈吉 一个人质
And, what I believe is a world first, I, Alan Partridge, a hostage,

993
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:50,610
正被枪指着进行直播
broadcasting live from a siege at gunpoint.

994
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:51,861
真有格调 阿兰
Pure class, Alan.

995
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:56,158
今天我们要问的问题是 有什么好东西一去不复返?
And today, we'll be asking, what was better in the olden days?

996
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:58,569
派特 开枪吧 我是说 你可以开始了
OK, Pat, shoot. I mean, you know, start speaking.

997
00:53:58,736 --> 00:54:00,158
- 尼克顿的特里  - 埃及
- Terry in Necton.  - Egypt.

998
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:02,706
- 这个不错  - 他们原来还能造金字塔的
- I'm liking this.  - They used to build the pyramids,

999
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:04,742
现在却连送你去机场的出租车都没有
now they can't get you a taxi to the airport.

1000
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:07,002
特里 我喜欢你的思考方式 要再打来哦
Terry, I like the way you think. Please call again.

1001
00:54:07,161 --> 00:54:08,788
- 没问题  - 韦伯恩的尼古拉斯
- Will do.  - Nicholas in Weybourne.

1002
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:11,207
- 以前的护士更好  - 一针见血
- Nurses were better in the old days.  - Bull's-eye.

1003
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:14,297
原先都是弗洛伦斯・南丁格尔的翻版
They used to be these Florence Nightingale type figures.

1004
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:17,259
现在都变成了穿着裤子的短发女人
These days it's just, you know, short-haired women in trousers

1005
00:54:17,421 --> 00:54:19,014
自顾自洗手
washing their own hands at a sink.

1006
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:22,468
稍后我将会问 哪种水果扭力最强...
Later on, I'll be asking which vegetable has the greatest torsional strength...

1007

Cows do not have hymens, just a partially opened cervix.

阿兰不喜欢我跟媒体交流
Oh, Alan doesn't like me speaking to the press.

00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:29,720
- 帕屈吉在里面似乎一点都不苦恼...  - 是他
- Inside, Partridge seems unfazed...  - Ah, him.

1045
00:56:29,887 --> 00:56:31,889
- 我上电视了 照片不错  - 他和持枪男子
- Me on TV. Good photo.  - He tried instead

1046
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:34,774
一起主播 试图安抚他的情绪
to calm the gunman by joining him in the studio.

1047
00:56:35,309 --> 00:56:37,653
好了 就是个标准的残疾人卫生间
Yes, just your basic disabled loo.

00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:42,237
低位坐便器 靠背 扶手 紧急按钮 还有丢卫生巾的桶
You've got your lowered seat pan, back pad, high-vis grab bar, panic cord, lady bin.

1049
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:44,151
阿兰 淡定点 你太兴奋了
Alan, calm down. You're being all hectic.

1050
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:47,613
就因为你上了电视吗? 你一直叽叽喳喳说个不停
This is because you're on TV, isn't it? You're all puffed up like a Robin.

1051
00:56:48,697 --> 00:56:50,119
你就是这么看我的
It's like you can see in me.

1052
00:56:50,282 --> 00:56:54,287
阿兰 你叫我来这 不只是让我看残疾人卫生间的吧?
Alan, you didn't bring me in here to talk about disabled toilet facilities, did you?

1053
00:56:54,453 --> 00:56:56,751
是的 不 不是
Yeah, I did. No, I didn't.

1054

哇 琳 你好美啊
Oh, wow. Lynn, you look fantastic.

1055

天啊
Good gracious.

1056
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:15,433
不好意思 我鼻子叫了 一紧张我就这样
I'm sorry about the nasal whistle. It's when I'm anxious.

1057
00:57:31,615 --> 00:57:35,745
你听过吗... "谢普... 您想要的电台"?
You know... you know, "Shape... the way you want it to be"?

1058
00:57:35,911 --> 00:57:38,289
- 怎么了?  - 我觉得你身材刚刚好
- Yeah?  - Your shape's the way I want it to be.

1059
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:40,048
我都性奋了
I'm on about your body.

1060
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:47,177
- 这是什么?  - 是... 我的小伙伴
- What might this be?  - That... is my damned todger.

1061
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:51,928
这都是安吉拉小姐闯的祸...
And it's all the fault of a certain Miss Angela...

1062
00:57:52,511 --> 00:57:54,479
不好意思 我不知道你姓什么
I'm sorry, I don't know your second name.

1063
00:57:54,638 --> 00:57:58,268
他很勇敢 有一次他在公园喂鸭子
He's very brave. He was once feeding ducks in the park.

1064
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:00,569
一只鸭子没吃食 而是咬了他一口
One took a peck at him and instead of retreating,

1065
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:02,980
他就用手背打了它一下
he hit it with the back of his hand.

1066
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:06,571
- 主播阿兰・帕屈吉...  - 嗨 你还有空"哇哇"一下吗?
- DJ Alan Partridge...  - Hi. You got time for a quick wah-wah?

1067
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,031
- 什么意思?  - 哇哇
- What?  - Quick wah-wah.

1068

- Sorry. You just did a different noise.  - Sorry.

1070
00:58:14,241 --> 00:58:18,041
这些... 这些媒体的把戏 你怎么看?
Look... how are you feeling about this whole media circus? How you feeling?

1071
00:58:18,245 --> 00:58:19,963
他们在虚张声势
Between you and me, pretty puffed up.

1072
00:58:20,122 --> 00:58:22,921
- 就像猫头鹰那样  - 希望你是个聪明人
- Like an owl.  - Let's hope you're a wise one.

1073
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:26,132
太好了 我投掷 你击球
Nice. I pitched it up, you knocked it out of the park.

1074
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:28,137
我们联手 不 这是女同的手势
Synergy. Oh, no, that's lesbians.

1075
00:58:28,296 --> 00:58:29,576
实话跟你说吧 阿兰
Let me tell you something, Alan.

1076
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:34,136
这次劫持事件中 你是媒体注意力的焦点
As far as the press is concerned, you are the face of this siege.

1077
00:58:35,262 --> 00:58:37,185
- 我是焦点  - 没错
- I am siege face.  - Exactly.

1078
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:40,521
这件事之后 你找工作比圣诞脱衣舞娘都容易
After this, you'll get more offers than a whore at our Christmas party.

1079
00:58:42,686 --> 00:58:44,905
我喜欢 嗯 我喜欢
I like that. Yeah, I like that.

1080
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:46,861
- 嗯  - 哦 没错 没错
- Yeah.  - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1081
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:49,197
你知道点什么 是吧?
You'd know a thing or two about that, wouldn't you?

1082
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:52,579
这时应该... "嗯" 他说 然后挠挠胡子
That would be... "Mm-hm. Hmm," he says. That's a moustache.

1083
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:54,281
说真的 你上过她吗?
Seriously, did you give her one?

1084
00:58:54,448 --> 00:58:58,043
哦... 我只是迫不及待地吻了她
Well, I... I gave her a ruddy big kiss she won't forget in a hurry.

1085
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:01,171
刚想解开胸罩 呃... 观望一下
Hand on the outside of the bra. Er... you know, reconnaissance.

1086
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:04,676
然后她躺在我怀里
And then I just held her in my arms because she

1087
00:59:04,689 --> 00:59:07,128
她说从没见过她妈妈
told me she never knew her mother, and I said,

1088
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:10,509
我说 "我是我妈带大的 她活了很大年纪
"Well, my mother raised me and lived to a ripe old age.

1089
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:13,642
但知道吗? 我一点也不了解她"
But guess what? I never really knew her."

1090
00:59:14,593 --> 00:59:17,267
呃... 然后...
Erm... and...

1091
00:59:17,429 --> 00:59:19,602
接着刚才的说 呃...
to get back on track, erm...

1092
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:21,683
我是说... 好棒!

He likes me, Lynn. Jason Tresswell likes me.

1095
00:59:27,064 --> 00:59:28,744
- 阿兰? 你还好吧?  - 我长话短说
- Alan? Are you OK?  - I've got to be quick.

1096
00:59:28,899 --> 00:59:31,197
派特以为我借他手机玩愤怒的小鸟
Pat thinks I've borrowed his phone to play Angry Birds.

1097
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:34,029
- 好吧 那是什么?  - 那是扔小鸟的电子游戏
- Of course. What is it?  - A computerised bird-throwing game.

1098
00:59:34,196 --> 00:59:36,369
- 不 我是问...  - 我开玩笑的 琳
- No, I meant...  - I'm joking, Lynn.

1099
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:38,416
给点面子嘛 大家都很给我面子
Enjoy me. Everyone else is.

1100
00:59:38,617 --> 00:59:41,166
格尔戴尔传媒公司觉得我是上帝二代
Goredale Media think I'm some sort of Christ 2.0.

1101
00:59:41,328 --> 00:59:44,582
知道吗 我马上就要去录早间新闻了
Do you know, I'm within a brair's headth of getting the breakfast show.

1102
00:59:44,748 --> 00:59:47,217
我是个打鸣的公鸡
I'll call myself the Morning Rooster, or the Talking Cock.

1103
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:49,844
- 阿兰 你思维混乱了  - 我想好了
- Alan, you're not thinking clearly.  - Yes, I am.

1104
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:51,846
琳 我再说一遍
Lynn, I'll say this once and I'll say it again.

1105
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:55,635
只要熬过了这一关 我的事业就会飞黄腾达的
My career's getting a shot in the arm and if I can stay in here to the bitter end,

1106
00:59:55,801 --> 00:59:59,647
我会是继纳尔逊勋爵和特丽莎修女之后的又一位伟人...
I will be the biggest thing to come out of Norwich since... Lord Nelson or Trisha.

1107
00:59:59,805 --> 01:00:01,352
想想这意味什么吧
Think about that and what that means.

1108
01:00:01,515 --> 01:00:03,734
你的首要任务是确保人质安全
Your first priority is the welfare of the hostages.

1109
01:00:03,892 --> 01:00:05,894
没错 告诉媒体这句话是我说的
That's good. Put that out as a press release and say I said it.

1110
01:00:06,061 --> 01:00:08,189
阿兰 你越来越妄自尊大了
Alan, your ego's getting the better of you.

1111
01:00:08,355 --> 01:00:11,825
我只需保持警觉 我把他们耍得团团转 琳
I've just got to stay alert and focused. I'm playing them like an oboe, Lynn.

1112
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:14,119
是不是很厉害?
How effed up is that?

1113
01:00:13,362 --> 01:00:17,810

别这样 哦 天啊
Not now. Oh, God.

1117
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:51,323
我被插销卡主了
I'm caught on the latch.

1118
01:01:04,411 --> 01:01:06,254
别这样 求你了
Oh, come on. Please.

1119
01:01:15,881 --> 01:01:19,511
不准动 警察 举起手来!
Stop, armed police! Get your hands above your head.

- They're my trousers.  - Get your hands above your head now!

1123
01:01:32,314 --> 01:01:34,567
你在干什么? 那么奇怪
What are you doing? It's weird.

1124
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:37,911
这地方到处都是狗仔队
There are paparazzi all over the place

1125
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:40,822
我可不想让他们拍到我的小鸡鸡
and I do not want them to get a photograph of my genitals.

1126
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:46,499
- 不会吧!  - 很好 来张正脸的
- Oh, come on!  - That's it, look at me.

1127
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:55,674
你离开的时候人质的情况如何?
And how were the hostages when you left?

1128
01:01:56,588 --> 01:01:58,966
- 瑟瑟发抖  - 他们的精神状态怎么样?
- Crouched.  - I mean, what's their state of mind?

1129
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:02,853
哦... 说实话 他们不停抱怨 没人要记下来吗?
Oh. Er... If I'm honest, a bit moany. Yeah. Is someone writing this down?

1130
01:02:03,011 --> 01:02:05,355
- 我在记  - 不好意思 我还以为你是头儿呢
- Yeah.  - Sorry. I thought you were some clothes.

1131
01:02:05,513 --> 01:02:07,982
差点忘了 谢谢给我尸检用的裤子
Thanks for the forensic trousers, by the way.

1132
01:02:08,642 --> 01:02:10,644
- 你可不可以...?  - 哦 不好意思
- Could you just um...?  - Crikey. Yeah, sorry.

1133
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:14,360
我只是想用这俩没用的袖子
I was actually going to fashion a sort of make-shift modesty sporran

1134
01:02:14,522 --> 01:02:16,695
弄点时尚元素
from the vacant arm flaps.

1135
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:24,249
好了 我们问完了
OK, I think we're done here.

1136
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:28,332
我可不可以梳洗一下? 我想用热毛巾擦把脸
Any chance of freshening up? I just need to wipe my face with a big hot towel.

1137
01:02:28,495 --> 01:02:31,499
你们打算让我在新闻发布会上出镜吗?
Presumably you wanna use me as part of your media strat?

1138
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:34,800
不用
No.

1139
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,337
- 你同意吗?  - 完全同意
- Do you agree?  - 100 per cent.

1140
01:02:36,503 --> 01:02:37,675
我懂了
Gotcha.

1141
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:41,930
警察说人质被解救之后你就可以接受采访了
The police said you could do media interviews when the siege is over.

1142
01:02:42,092 --> 01:02:44,544
那就太晚了 琳 人们很快就会忘了
It will be too late then, Lynn. People move on.

1143
01:02:44,557 --> 01:02:47,019
格尔戴尔传媒公司也会重新开始
Goredale Media will move on.

1144
01:02:47,931 --> 01:02:49,933
但大家还是会谈论你
But you're still being talked about.

1145
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:53,695
他们谈论我只是因为我光着屁股
Only cos every time I look at the telly, they're showing a picture of my arse.

1146
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:57,274
对你来说没什么 电视上只放过你的脸
It's all right for you. Every other time I look, they show a picture of your face.

1147
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,489
但是一不小心... 就又亮出了我的屁股
And then the next time... surprise, surprise, my arse again.

1148
01:03:00,652 --> 01:03:02,495
我只是跟媒体聊了些你的事
I was only telling people about you.

1149
01:03:02,654 --> 01:03:08,252
过去我是格尔戴尔的财神爷 但现在却是个帕屈吉馅饼 上面还有豌豆
You know, I was Goredale's golden goose, and now I'm just Partridge pie, with peas.

1150
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:10,833
但你为什么想要为那样的人卖命?
But why do you want to work for people like that?

1151
01:03:10,996 --> 01:03:13,670
- 格尔戴尔欺软怕硬  - 是 但那又怎么样?
- Goredale are bullies.  - Yeah. And what do you do with a bully?

1152
01:03:13,873 --> 01:03:16,877
只能和他们做朋友 让他们别欺负自己
You make friends with the bully so they bully someone else.

1153
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:19,880
- "如果失去了灵魂..."  - 海牙宣言?
- "What doth it profit a man..."  - DOTH?

1154
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:24,351
"就算赢了全世界 又有什么意义呢?" 马太福音 第八章...
"if he gains the whole world yet loses his soul?" Matthew, chapter eight...

1155
01:03:24,509 --> 01:03:27,638
我知道谁写的 我不会出卖自己的灵魂的 琳
Yeah, I know who wrote it. I'm not going to sell my soul, Lynn.

1156
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:32,355
我想出长期出租我的灵魂 给格尔戴尔传媒公司
I want to, if you like, lend my soul to Goredale Media

1157
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:34,152
能换好多钱
on a long-term basis for cash.

1158
01:03:34,311 --> 01:03:36,234
这可不是一回事
It's a very different thing.

1159
01:03:40,984 --> 01:03:42,944
我不知道你是怎么看待你自己的
I don't know how you can look yourself in the eye.

1160
01:03:43,111 --> 01:03:44,613
我看不到自己 琳 鼻子太高了
I can't, Lynn. My nose is in the way.

1161
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:46,952
你可以对报道妄加评论
You can talk, prattling away on every news bulletin.

1162
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:49,501
但你是哪颗葱啊?
I mean, who the heck do you think you are?

1163
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:54,623
- 我是琳・本菲尔德  - 你看起来不像琳・本菲尔德
- I'm Lynn Benfield.  - You don't look like Lynn Benfield.

1164
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:58,168
你的头发 还有你的态度 都是怎么回事?
I mean, what has happened to you, with your attitude and your hair?

1165
01:03:58,335 --> 01:04:00,087
你变成一个大头娃娃
You've literally become a big head.

1166
01:04:01,296 --> 01:04:03,719
- 我很喜欢  - 我也不想这么说 琳
- I like it.  - I take no pleasure in saying this, Lynn,

1167
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:07,177
但你的脑袋看起来就像正在爆炸的蘑菇云
but a lot of people think it looks like a photograph of an explosion.

1168
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:10,596
我不想再和你这样的人共事了
I don't know if I want to work for a man like you.

1169
01:04:10,722 --> 01:04:13,726
我也不想雇佣一个看起来像大妈的人
I don't know that I want to employ someone who looks like a madam.

1170
01:04:13,892 --> 01:04:15,235
我指的可不是巴黎的时尚大妈
And I don't mean a Parisian one

1171
01:04:15,435 --> 01:04:18,484
我指的是那种住在铁道旁小破屋里的大妈
I mean, one who lives in a terraced house behind a train station.

1172
01:04:32,452 --> 01:04:35,706
- 把门打开!  - 武装警察!
- Doors opening!  - Armed police! Armed police!

1173
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:39,046
闭嘴 别嚷嚷了
Oh, shut up, will you? Stop shouting.

1174
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:42,509
- 别激动 派特 小心脚下  - 我会下楼梯的 明白吗?
- Easy, Pat. Mind the steps.  - I'm able to walk down steps, all right?

1175
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:44,718
他这么说是因为你正用枪指着我的脑袋
He means because the gun's against my head.

1176
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:48,852
- 每个人都自己的想法 是吧?  - 听到了 继续说
- Everybody has an opinion, huh?  - Hear, hear. Well said.

1177
01:04:49,052 --> 01:04:51,100
- 哦  - 嗨 派特
- Oh.  - Hi, Pat.

1178
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:53,765
嘿 阿兰 怎么回事? 我们正在演出一场伟大的节目
Hey, Alan. What happened? We were in the middle of a show,

1179
01:04:53,932 --> 01:04:55,809
可突然你的屁股出现在了网上
and then your arse is all over the Internet.

1180
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:58,398
你两腿之间的那个是火鸡头吧
Looked like you had a Turkey's head between your legs.

1181
01:04:58,561 --> 01:05:00,859
不是 不是 他们有鸡喙
No, it didn't. No, it didn't. It doesn't have a beak.

1182
01:05:01,022 --> 01:05:03,070
而且我很明智地
And, yeah, I took an executive decision

1183
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:05,656
把小鸡鸡夹在了屁股里
to stow my cock and balls up against my backside.

1184
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:08,158
真不敢相信 你把我丢给了这群疯子
I can't believe you left me with this nutcase.

1185
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:10,289
等一下 你也有枪
Hang on a minute, you're the one with the gun.

1186
01:05:10,448 --> 01:05:13,076
- 看到了吗? 他还挺逗的  - 他不紧张了
- See? He's hilarious.  - He's solid. He's solid.

1187
01:05:13,243 --> 01:05:17,623
- 送披萨的 派特  - 嘿 嘿 站住 把头盔拿下来
- Pizzas coming through now, Pat.  - Hey. Hey, hey. Hold on. Helmet off.

1188
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:26,514
哦 你好
Oh, hello.

1189
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:31,428
我想让阿兰给我送来
Actually, I want Alan to bring them in.

1190
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:37,267
派特 那样不行的 阿兰没准备好
That might not be possible, Pat. Alan's not prepared to do that.

1191
01:05:37,434 --> 01:05:39,482
不... 我准备好了
No... I am prepared to do that.

1192
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:42,193
- 没这么简单 派特  - 你想让我放几个人?
- It's not that simple. Pat.  - Do you want me to release some people?

1193
01:05:42,397 --> 01:05:43,865
是的 我们商量一下
Sure. Let's talk about that.

1194
01:05:44,023 --> 01:05:46,151
阿兰 我先放了女人 你看怎么样?
Alan, what do you reckon if I let the women go?

1195
01:05:46,317 --> 01:05:49,321
嗯 放了那几个女人 先留着安吉拉
Yeah, let a couple of the women go. Maybe keep Angela.

1196
01:05:49,904 --> 01:05:52,498
- 但她的孩子们肯定很想她  - 她都有孩子了?
- But her kids will be worried sick.  - She's got kids?

1197
01:05:52,699 --> 01:05:55,498
嗯 两个儿子 一个14岁一个15岁
Yeah. Two boys, 14 and 15.

1198
01:05:56,494 --> 01:05:57,996
肯定很忙
I believe they're a real handful.

1199
01:05:58,163 --> 01:06:01,133
我在想什么呢? 放了所有的女人吧
Yeah, what was I thinking? Let all the women go.

1200
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:03,259
派特 给我五分钟的时间联系一下总部
Pat, just give me five minutes with head office.

1201
01:06:03,418 --> 01:06:05,887
他来送披萨 阿兰 快过来
He's bringing them in now. Alan, come on.

1202
01:06:06,546 --> 01:06:08,173
- 最上面那盒  - 最上面那盒
- Top one.  - Top one.

1203
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:11,601
- 哦 哦 好的 最上面那盒  - 好了 过来
- Yeah, yeah, cheers, guys. Top one.  - OK, come on, son.

1204
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:14,721
糟了
Oh, shit.

1205
01:06:18,558 --> 01:06:20,526
你为什么要和送餐员打招呼?
Why did you say hello to that delivery guy?

1206
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:26,445
他? 他让我想起来一个老相识 麦克・凯布
Oh, him? No, he just reminded me of a man I know called Mike Cable,

1207
01:06:26,608 --> 01:06:30,704
他帮我报税 从97年到98年
who did my accounts from '97 to '98.

1208
01:06:30,862 --> 01:06:32,614
不 到99年
Actually, no. '99.

1209
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:34,999
但后来他女儿生了重病
Till he stopped because his daughter was very ill.

1210
01:06:35,158 --> 01:06:36,910
看到他让我想起来从前
Yeah, it was touch and go, actually.

1211
01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:40,247
他和桑德拉花掉了所有积蓄 也不能去度假
He and Sandra were in bits, they had to cancel their holiday.

1212
01:06:40,872 --> 01:06:43,000
- 他们本想乘飞机去托斯卡纳区(意大利地名)  - 嗯
- It was a fly-drive to Tuscany.  - Hm.

1213
01:06:43,166 --> 01:06:46,796
下次见到他一定要告诉他 有个警察长得和他很像
I must tell him, actually, that there's a policeman that looks just like him.

1214
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:48,217
你说什么?
What's that?

1215
01:06:48,379 --> 01:06:51,349
我要告诉麦克有个送披萨的长得和他很像
Must tell Mike that there's a pizza man who looks just like him.

1216
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:54,682
我要饿死了
I'm famished.

1217
01:06:57,555 --> 01:06:59,432
- 女士们 你们可以走了  - 真的吗?
- Ladies, you're free to go.  - What?

1218
01:06:59,641 --> 01:07:01,814
- 是的  - 上帝保佑你 派特
- Yep.  - God bless you, Pat.

1219
01:07:01,976 --> 01:07:03,102
回头见
See you. Bye.

1220
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:05,317
等出去我会亲手给你做披萨吃
I'll make you a home-made pizza when you get out.

1221
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:07,232
嗯 这家的披萨很不错
Yeah, these pizzas are pretty good.

1222
01:07:10,151 --> 01:07:11,573
- 灰姑娘的鞋子  - 嗯...
- Cinderella.  - Yeah, well...

1223
01:07:11,736 --> 01:07:14,239
不 她穿的... 是水晶鞋 是吧?
No, hers was... that was a glass one, wasn't it?

1224
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:17,993
铁皮人来了
Here comes the Tin Man.

1225
01:07:27,544 --> 01:07:30,798
- 我正要给你拿一份披萨  - 给我那份就可以
- Just trying to find your pizza.  - Well, just give me that one.

1226
01:07:32,173 --> 01:07:33,641
- 嗯?  - 那个
- Hm?  - That one.

1227
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:35,473
- 哪个?  - 第一个
- Which one?  - The top one.

1228
01:07:37,262 --> 01:07:38,889
哦...
Oh...

1229
01:07:39,097 --> 01:07:41,065
- 我去分披萨  - 哦 好的
- I'll take the pizzas.  - Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1230
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:48,114
哇 纸盒披萨! 谢谢你又回来了 阿兰
Woo-ho, stuffed crust! Thanks for coming back, Alan.

1231
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:52,952
- 你在干嘛?  - 我只是想看看
- What are you doing?  - I'm just seeing how you'll look

1232
01:07:53,111 --> 01:07:56,115
当你在大屏幕上播报早间新闻的样子
on the billboard for when you start on The Breakfast Show.

1233
01:07:56,281 --> 01:07:59,285
- 早间新闻?  - 阿兰 能和你聊聊吗?
- The Breakfast Show?  - Alan, can I have a word?

1234
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:02,624
当然能 我正好拿了切披萨的刀
Yeah, sure. Just bringing the pizza cutter.

1235
01:08:03,955 --> 01:08:05,923
你想要分成几份 六份还是八份?
Right, how many do you want. Six or eight?

1236
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:07,800
天啊 有把电枪!
Oh, my God, that's a taser!

1237
01:08:07,959 --> 01:08:11,054
没有用啊 我拿着披萨刀 这里却没有披萨
This is no use, it's a pizza cutter. And that is not a pizza.

1238
01:08:11,713 --> 01:08:14,933
但它怎么会在这里呢? 呃...
Thing is, how did it get there? Erm...

1239
01:08:15,425 --> 01:08:19,146
有可能是披萨店正在举办活动 你中了一把枪
Unless the pizza company are running a competition in which you win a taser.

1240
01:08:19,304 --> 01:08:22,353
但这说不通 是吧? 你发现了吗 有可能是警察放的?
That doesn't make sense, does it? Do you realise, it's the police?

1241
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:26,611
那些警察... 他们有铜制的护颈
The ruddy po... do you know... they've got some brass neck for a bunch of coppers.

1242
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:28,487
对此我很气愤
I'm actually really angry about that.

1243
01:08:28,646 --> 01:08:30,740
你应该留着这把枪
You should keep that as an extra weapon.

1244
01:08:30,898 --> 01:08:34,994
你以为我是笨蛋吗? 我早都看穿了你们的把戏
What kind of fool do you take me for, eh? I'm one step ahead of all of you.

1245
01:08:35,153 --> 01:08:37,281
我也看穿你了 哥们
And I'm just a step behind you, mate.

1246
01:08:38,031 --> 01:08:40,409
- 哦  - 要一直盯着目标 派特
- Ooh.  - Never take your eye off the ball, Pat.

1247
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:41,792
这是获胜的第一条准则
First rule of business.

1248
01:08:41,993 --> 01:08:44,746
第二条准则 时刻准备好抓住机会
Second rule of business, always be prepared for an opportunity

1249
01:08:44,912 --> 01:08:47,631
就像我这样
when it arises, like I was just then.

1250
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:48,757
是的
Yeah.

1251
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:52,386
我知道这对你来说有点高深 这是达尔文的进化论
Of course I wouldn't expect you to understand that. It's Darwinian.

1252
01:08:53,171 --> 01:08:56,175
- 你这个畜生  - 你也这么想吗 阿兰?
- You're a runt.  - Is that what you think, Alan?

1253
01:08:58,009 --> 01:09:00,353
我不会说那些脏字的
I wouldn't quite, you know, use those words.

1254
01:09:00,511 --> 01:09:02,229
但是... 我想...
Well, I think... I think...

1255
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,557
他们的意思表达的是对的...
the sort of the gist of what, you know...

1256
01:09:04,724 --> 01:09:06,397
我只是不想被欺负
I just don't like bullies.

1257
01:09:07,435 --> 01:09:10,860
- 嗯... 我能把这个脱掉吗?  - 哦 当然可以
- Um... can I take this off, please?  - Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure.

1258
01:09:11,022 --> 01:09:13,901
- 不 我在跟他说话  - 哦 该死的
- No, I'm talking to him.  - Oh, for fuck's sake.

1259
01:09:14,067 --> 01:09:15,785
- 脱吧  - 谢谢
- Yeah, go ahead.  - Thank you.

1260
01:09:16,736 --> 01:09:18,158
你没事吧?
Are you all right?

1261
01:09:18,321 --> 01:09:21,700
我有点担心自己撑不撑得住 但应该没事
Well, I was worried about the old head but I think I've got a handle on it.

1262
01:09:22,784 --> 01:09:25,128
- 很好  - 阿兰很机智的 帕特
- Very witty.  - Alan's a smart cookie, Pat.

1263
01:09:26,704 --> 01:09:30,629
他想从这件危机中牟取商业利益
He's treated this whole crisis like a business opportunity.

1264
01:09:30,792 --> 01:09:35,514
他打量着四周 心想"我该怎么利用这一切呢?"
He's taken a look around him and he's thought, "How can I make this work for me?"

1265
01:09:36,464 --> 01:09:38,307
- 做得好 阿兰  - 谢谢
- Well done, Alan.  - Cheers.

1266
01:09:38,466 --> 01:09:40,889
- 没错 做得好 阿兰  - 谢谢
- Yeah, well done, Alan.  - Thank you.

1267
01:09:41,552 --> 01:09:44,101
知道吗 你和我有很多相似之处
You know, you and me, we've got something going here.

1268
01:09:44,263 --> 01:09:46,424
派特是个老古板 只会想1983年那样
Pat might be a dinosaur, filling his show

1269
01:09:46,437 --> 01:09:48,609
在节目里聊天和接观众电话
with chit-chat and phone-ins like it's 1983,

1270
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:49,902
但你和我们一样
but you're one of us.

1271
01:09:50,061 --> 01:09:53,065
你知道媒体是用来赚钱的 你很聪明
You know radio's just business. You'll do well out of this.

1272
01:09:53,231 --> 01:09:55,905
所以.... 我会给你找个胸大的助理
And er... I'll get you a glamorous assistant with big tits

1273
01:09:56,109 --> 01:09:59,534
换掉你现在那个土包子
to take over from that frumpy old cow you've got at the moment.

1274
01:09:59,696 --> 01:10:01,414
那个什么多德法尔女士
You know, Mrs. fucking Doubtfire.

1275
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:07,545
丹尼... 杰森把你的早间新闻给我播了
Danny, er... Jason gave me your breakfast show.

1276
01:10:08,579 --> 01:10:10,206
- 嗯  - 他说的是真的吗?
- Yeah.  - Is that true?

1277
01:10:10,373 --> 01:10:12,046
- 是这样...  - 蠢货
- Well...  - Twat.

1278
01:10:14,502 --> 01:10:16,049
天啊
Oh, my God.

1279
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:17,839
快上! 快上!
Go! Go! Go!

1280
01:10:19,924 --> 01:10:21,847
武装警察!
Armed police!

1281
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:24,432
武装警察! 所有人趴下!
Armed police! Everybody stay down!

1282
01:10:24,595 --> 01:10:28,190
- 蹲下! 别动!  - 你们有剪刀吗?
- Stay down! Don't move! Don't move!  - Have you got any scissors?

1283
01:10:28,391 --> 01:10:29,984
你们有剪刀吗?
Have you got any scissors?

1284
01:10:30,768 --> 01:10:32,145
武装警察! 武装警察!
Armed police! Armed police!

1285
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:34,985
办公室里没人 法莱尔在哪里? 法莱尔在哪里?
Studio's empty. Where's Farrell? Where's Partridge?

1286
01:10:40,278 --> 01:10:43,373
# 滚啤酒桶... #
# Roll out the barrel... #

1287
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:50,793
各就各位 站到车前!
Get into position, get in front of that bus!

1288
01:10:51,581 --> 01:10:55,677
车上有三个人 我需要一个狙击手
We got three on a bus. Three on a bus. I want a green light on a sniper now.

1289
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:58,470
不会吧
This cannot be happening.

1290
01:10:59,005 --> 01:11:01,428
天啊 阿兰 看 好大的场面 是吧?
Jeez, Alan. Look at this. Quite alarming, isn't it?

1291
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:03,931
呃... 我们不会有事的
Er... I think... I think we'll be fine.

1292
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:07,313
谢谢你 阿兰 我只是想在格尔戴尔传媒公司多待一会
Thanks for doing this, Alan. I wanted to stick it to Goredale one more time.

1293
01:11:07,472 --> 01:11:10,066
派特 我自甘平庸 格尔戴尔总是焦点
I don't mind in the slightest, Pat. Goredale are tits.

1294
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:15,404
警察们 我没有交税 没有交保险 也没系安全带
Right, coppers, I've got nae tax, nae insurance and I'm not wearing a seatbelt.

1295
01:11:15,563 --> 01:11:17,986
你们要把我怎么着?
What are you going to do about it this time?

1296
01:11:20,443 --> 01:11:22,821
- 快开车! 快开车!  - 我们走!
- Start the car! Start the car!  - Let's go!

1297
01:11:27,367 --> 01:11:28,366
帕屈吉来了

1298
01:11:28,367 --> 01:11:31,166
对 我们给他们点颜色瞧瞧
Right, let's give them some stick.

1299
01:11:31,329 --> 01:11:33,582
你们正在收听的是帕特和阿兰带来的
You're listening to Pat and Alan

1300
01:11:33,748 --> 01:11:36,092
关于格尔戴尔传媒公司的报道
with a message for the Goredale Medias of this world.

1301
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:40,718
如果你认为能用机器人代替真人主播
If you think you can take real DJs and turn them into radio robots,

1302
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:43,258
那你要好好想想了 因为我们要证明给你们看
think again, because we're gonna get up in your face.

1303
01:11:43,424 --> 01:11:44,346
是的
Great.

1304
01:11:44,509 --> 01:11:48,514
此时此刻 我们要带给大家一场现场路演
With a big fat slice of road show radio right here, right now.

1305
01:11:48,679 --> 01:11:50,272
现在是下午1点27分
The time is 1:27.

1306
01:11:50,431 --> 01:11:52,149
下面是约翰・法汉演唱的"我的声音"(澳大利亚摇滚歌王)
This is John Farnham and The Voice.

1307
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:05,742
今天的问题是 为什么人们要把鸡蛋放在冰箱里?
Today we're asking, why do people keep their eggs in the fridge?

1308
01:12:05,905 --> 01:12:09,455
再说一遍 为什么人们非要把鸡蛋放在冰箱里?
Once again, why do people insist on keeping their eggs in the fridge?

1309
01:12:09,617 --> 01:12:13,793
还有个问题 清洁工人如果拒绝收坏掉的烤面包机
And can a binman reasonably expect a Christmas tip

1310
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:17,626
那他还能不能拿到圣诞节奖金了?
when he has point-blank refused to dispose of a broken toaster?

1311
01:12:17,792 --> 01:12:20,762
- 好问题!  - 那今天的提问就是它了
- Good question!  - And that can be today's large question.

1312
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:23,890
提问时间到
Large question.

1313
01:12:24,841 --> 01:12:29,813
现在播报交通信息 A149路段交通非常缓慢
Oh, and we have some travel news. There's slow-moving traffic on the A149.

1314
01:12:29,971 --> 01:12:32,520
这都是一辆大黄车里的怪叔叔闯的祸
That'll be due to wacky blokes on a big yellow bus.

1315
01:12:34,517 --> 01:12:37,236
比赛开始啦 我们玩配对游戏
It's competition time, and we 're playing pairs.

1316
01:12:37,395 --> 01:12:39,113
- 超人二人组 百...  - 百得公司
- Sid on line two. Black and...  - Decker.

1317
01:12:39,272 --> 01:12:40,364
- 一尘...  - 不染
- Spick and...  - Span.

1318
01:12:40,523 --> 01:12:41,524
- 霍尔和...  - 奥兹
- Hall and...  - Oates.

1319
01:12:41,691 --> 01:12:42,738
- 鸡蛋和...  - 培根
- Egg and...  - Bacon.

1320
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:44,277
噢 明明是腌猪腿!
Oh, it was gammon!

1321
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:46,491
我想直接说出来 格尔戴尔烂透了
Can I just say, I think Goredale are awful.

1322
01:12:46,654 --> 01:12:47,826
没错 一帮子混蛋
Yeah, they are bastards.

1323
01:12:47,989 --> 01:12:50,663
这就是我不干的原因 你懂我的意思吗?
That's why I've washed my hands of them. You know what I say?

1324
01:12:50,825 --> 01:12:56,878
我常常说"如果失去了灵魂 就算赢了全世界 又有什么意义呢?"
I always say, "What doth it profit a man if he gain the whole world yet lose his soul?"

1325
01:12:57,915 --> 01:13:00,293
大家好像很认可我 真的是这样
And people seem to like that. They really do.

1326
01:13:06,257 --> 01:13:08,760
# 你就是声音 试着去领悟 #
# You're the voice, try and understand it #

1327
01:13:08,926 --> 01:13:11,554
# 说出来吧 大声喊出来 #
# Make a noise and make it clear #

1328
01:13:11,721 --> 01:13:13,849
# 哇 噢 噢 噢 #
# Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh #

1329
01:13:14,015 --> 01:13:17,269
# 哇 噢 噢 噢! # 
# Whoa-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh! #

1330
01:13:17,643 --> 01:13:22,820
# 我们不会坐以待毙 我们毫无畏惧 #
# We're not gonna sit in silence We're not gonna live with fear #

1331
01:13:22,982 --> 01:13:25,110
# 哇 噢 噢 噢 #
# Whoa-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh #

1332
01:13:25,693 --> 01:13:27,536
派特 你好像引起所有人的共鸣了
It looks like you've touched a nerve, Pat.

1333
01:13:27,695 --> 01:13:30,995
他们是我的听众 阿兰 广大劳动人民
These are my listeners, Alan, ordinary working people.

1334
01:13:31,198 --> 01:13:33,086
现在是中午 他们不用上班
They're not working, it's the middle of the day.

1335
01:13:33,099 --> 01:13:34,998
除非是弹性上班制
Unless they're on flexi-time.

1336
01:13:35,703 --> 01:13:38,798
快看 我离婚那会 在那住过一阵子
Oh, look. I used to live in one of those after my divorce.

1337
01:13:39,498 --> 01:13:41,500
电视和厨房都很棒
TV, kitchen, very nice.

1338
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:45,346
嘿 伙计们 我在看格尔戴尔媒体的全家福
Hey, people, I'm looking at a picture of Goredale Media.

1339
01:13:45,504 --> 01:13:48,098
说实话 一帮子唯利是图的家伙
Honestly, look at that bunch of corporate mercenaries.

1340
01:13:48,758 --> 01:13:51,853
为什么不能为了纯粹的热爱去广播呢?
What's wrong with doing radio for the love of radio?

1341
01:13:52,303 --> 01:13:54,897
为了半毛钱他们什么都愿干
They would do anything for 30 pieces of silver.

1342
01:13:56,057 --> 01:14:00,187
现在你们收听的是"帕特和阿兰秀" 因为爱 所以广播
You're listening to the Pat and Alan Show. Radio for the love of radio.

1343
01:14:00,394 --> 01:14:03,022
由卡斯特罗赞助播出
Sponsored by Castro.

1344
01:14:04,607 --> 01:14:06,450
我去下洗手间
Just gonna use the loo.

1345
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:23,876
- 阿兰?  - 嗨
- Alan?  - Hi.

1346
01:14:24,043 --> 01:14:26,296
阿兰 我有话要和你说
Alan, I want to talk to you.

1347
01:14:27,088 --> 01:14:28,180
阿兰?
Alan?

1348
01:14:52,613 --> 01:14:54,286
噢 嗨 派特
Oh, hi, Pat.

1349
01:14:54,448 --> 01:14:56,792
阿兰 你怎么进去的?
Alan, how did you even get in there?

1350
01:14:56,951 --> 01:15:00,672
额... 我挪走了一块铝板 就滑进来了
Um... l just removed an aluminium panel. Slid straight in.

1351
01:15:00,997 --> 01:15:04,342
- 看了下手册 这里还不错 对吧?  - 你声音听起来很搞笑
- Er... textbook. It's good in there, isn't it?  - Your voice sounds funny.

1352
01:15:04,542 --> 01:15:06,681
我想是马桶是环形的
I think the conical shape of the toilet's turned

1353
01:15:06,694 --> 01:15:08,843
所以带点环绕音效
it into a sort of a compact amphitheatre.

1354
01:15:09,588 --> 01:15:11,841
- 好奇怪  - 没错 派特 非常古怪
- It's weird.  - It is, Pat. It's bizarre.

1355
01:15:12,008 --> 01:15:14,812
我想逃来着 可是失败了
It is and was a failed escape attempt, a

1356
01:15:14,825 --> 01:15:17,640
你可以这么看 有点像失败版的"肖申克救赎"
sort of a Shitshank Redemption, if you will.

1357
01:15:17,805 --> 01:15:20,558
阿兰的救赎 对吗?
Ah. The Armitage Shank Redemption, eh?

1358
01:15:20,725 --> 01:15:23,774
哈哈哈 哈哈! 我笑声像管道 我自己也在水管里
Ha-ha-ha, ha-ha! I'm laughing like a drain and I'm in one.

1359
01:15:23,978 --> 01:15:26,276
握个手 派特 好朋友 派特是我的好朋友
Shake hands, Pat. Friends. Friends, Pat, friends.

1360
01:15:26,439 --> 01:15:30,319
朋友? 我知道你都做了什么 你这个老滑头
Friends? I know what you did, you fucking snake.

1361
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:32,578
- "解雇派特"  - 什么?
- "Just sack Pat."  - Huh?

1362
01:15:32,737 --> 01:15:35,081
- 你和他们一样  - 派特 冷静点
- You're as bad as the rest of them.  - Pat, be reasonable.

1363
01:15:35,239 --> 01:15:37,958
开枪之前 就稍微想想
Before you think of shooting anyone, just for a second think,

1364
01:15:38,117 --> 01:15:42,543
一个人是有多可悲 才会把自己塞进粪池呢?
what would drive a man to incarcerate himself in the septic tank? It's pathetic.

1365
01:15:43,622 --> 01:15:47,593
- 我不会杀了你  - 谢天谢地 这是个好消息
- I'm not going to shoot you.  - Thank God for that. That's good news.

1366
01:15:49,628 --> 01:15:51,005
我的神啊 不要啊
Sweet mother of God, no.

1367
01:15:51,213 --> 01:15:53,307
愿天使和圣徒保佑我们!
Oh, angels and saints preserve us!

1368
01:15:53,466 --> 01:15:55,343
上帝啊 最好别拉稀!
Dear God, let them be firm!

1369
01:15:57,803 --> 01:15:59,680
救命啊!
Help!

1370
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:02,984
停车!
Stop the bus!

1371
01:16:03,517 --> 01:16:06,270
- 这是什么?  - 粪池 你可以拿去
- What's that?  - It's a septic tank. You can have it.

1372
01:16:48,604 --> 01:16:50,698
噢... 要不要这样!
Oh... not again!

1373
01:16:53,484 --> 01:16:55,703
该死的吉普寨人 又在枪的准心上耍花样
Damn gypsies tampered with the sights.

1374
01:17:04,245 --> 01:17:05,588
相信我 苏珊

疑犯在克罗默...

1377
01:17:56,046 --> 01:17:58,845
阿兰 你是个可怜虫
You're a fucking clown, Alan.

1378
01:17:59,008 --> 01:18:00,681
啊 嗨 派特

I trusted you, Alan. I thought we were friends.

1380
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,438
- 可你背叛了我  - 我...
- But you let me down.  - Well, I...

1381
01:18:08,601 --> 01:18:11,070
- 你害我被开除  - 看这! 派特!
- You got me sacked.  - Over here! Pat!

1382

瞧!
Look!

1383
01:18:14,064 --> 01:18:16,066
糟糕!
Oh, shit!

1384
01:18:17,735 --> 01:18:18,782
他在搞什么?
What was that?

1385
01:18:18,944 --> 01:18:22,619
打算转移你的注意力来着 没错
I think it was supposed to be some sort of distraction. Yeah.

1386
01:18:22,781 --> 01:18:24,704
- 非常勇敢 可是毫无意义  - 怎么回事?
- Brave but pointless.  - Excuse me?

1387
01:18:24,867 --> 01:18:26,995
天啊 快进去 快点!
Oh, God, get back inside. Quick, now!

1388
01:18:27,161 --> 01:18:30,085
- 我们想下去  - 你搞清点状况? 我们在火力对峙
- We want to get down there.  - Do you mind? This is an armed stand-off.

1389
01:18:30,247 --> 01:18:31,669
- 说到哪了?  - 我害你开除
- Where were we?  - I got you sacked.

1390
01:18:31,874 --> 01:18:33,876
- 是的 你背叛了我  - 派特 听我说
- Yeah, you let me down.  - Pat, listen to me.

1391
01:18:34,084 --> 01:18:35,301
- 我可以处理  - 什么?
- I've got this.  - Pardon?

1392
01:18:35,461 --> 01:18:37,861
- 我说 我可以处理  - 你们打算搞多久?
- I said, I've got this.  - How long is it going to go on for?

1393
01:18:38,005 --> 01:18:40,007
- 闭嘴!  - 他叫你闭嘴
- Shut up!  - He's telling you to shut up.

1394
01:18:40,174 --> 01:18:41,676
- 冷静点  - 没听清
- Calm down.  - Didn't get that.

1395
01:18:41,842 --> 01:18:43,469
- 你离话筒太近了  - 冷静点
- Too close to your mouth.  - Calm down.

1396
01:18:43,636 --> 01:18:45,636
- 话筒离得太近了!  - 你没听见吗?
- It's too close to your mouth!  - Did you get that?

1397
01:18:45,763 --> 01:18:46,685
听见什么?
Did I get what?

1398
01:18:46,847 --> 01:18:50,727
她说 如果你放下来复气枪 你就不会有麻烦
She's saying, if you put your air rifles back, you won't be in too much trouble.

1399
01:18:50,893 --> 01:18:53,521
- 这是把猎枪  - 这是把气枪 那把才是真的
- This is a shotgun.  - This is an air rifle. That's a shotgun.

1400
01:18:54,313 --> 01:18:56,315
你们自己解决吧
We'll leave you to it.

1401
01:18:56,649 --> 01:18:58,651
我投降
I surrender.

1402
01:19:07,326 --> 01:19:08,623
派特?
Pat?

1403
01:19:10,913 --> 01:19:12,711
派特?
Pat?

1404
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:16,631
- 我过去带茉莉来过这个码头  - 美好时光
- I brought Molly to this pier.  - Happy times.

1405
01:19:16,835 --> 01:19:18,337
我把她的骨灰洒在这
I scattered her ashes here.

1406
01:19:18,504 --> 01:19:19,926

埋葬在大海里
Buried at sea.

1408
01:19:23,717 --> 01:19:25,811
和本・拉登一样
Like Bin Laden.

1409
01:19:26,387 --> 01:19:28,481
现在我们也在这
And now here we are.

1410
01:19:29,515 --> 01:19:31,267
命运的轮回
The circle of life.

1411
01:19:31,475 --> 01:19:33,898
太阳马戏团
Cirque du Soleil.

1412
01:19:36,897 --> 01:19:38,649
别看着我
Turn your head away.

1413
01:19:38,857 --> 01:19:40,029
冷静点
Let's just calm down.

1414
01:19:40,192 --> 01:19:42,160
- 派特 别这样  - 别看着我
- Pat, come on.  - Turn your head away.

1415
01:19:42,319 --> 01:19:44,242
- 派特 听我说...  - 派特 你吓坏我了
- Pat, listen to me...  - Pat, you're scaring me.

1416
01:19:44,405 --> 01:19:46,783
- 我不想再说第三次  - 派特 你冷静一点
- I won't ask again.  - Pat, I need you to stay calm.

1417
01:19:46,949 --> 01:19:49,498
别看着我
Turn your head away.

1418
01:19:51,245 --> 01:19:58,720
# 也许我对你的爱不够 常常忽略了你 #
# Maybe I didn't love you, quite as often as I could have #

1419
01:19:58,877 --> 01:20:00,220
你在做什么?
What are you doing?

1420
01:20:00,379 --> 01:20:08,379
# 或许我待你不够好 没有尽自己本分 #
# Maybe I didn't treat you, quite as good as I should have #

1421
01:20:08,846 --> 01:20:10,223
别唱了!
Stop it!

1422
01:20:10,389 --> 01:20:14,610
# 倘若我令你觉得自己不够重要 #
# And if I made you feel second best #

1423
01:20:15,144 --> 01:20:18,444
# 宝贝 对不起 我太糊涂 #
# Girl, I'm sorry I was blind #

1424
01:20:19,606 --> 01:20:24,157
# 但你永远在我心中 #
# But you were always on my mind #

1425
01:20:25,404 --> 01:20:29,955
# 你永远在我心中 #
# You were always on my mind #

1426
01:20:32,870 --> 01:20:34,588
- # 也许我... #  - 派特 你准备好...
- # Maybe I... #  - Pat, are you ready to...

1427
01:20:34,747 --> 01:20:36,841
闭嘴 该死的!
Shut up, you dick!

1428
01:20:39,335 --> 01:20:40,678
派特 你在干什么?
Pat, what are you doing?

1429
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:42,679
我想和茉莉一起
I want to be with Molly.

1430
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:43,964
什么?
What?

1431
01:20:45,924 --> 01:20:47,847
我想和茉莉一起
I want to be with Molly.

1432
01:20:49,178 --> 01:20:51,397
- 派特 别这样  - 派特 别干傻事!
- Pat, don't do this.  - Pat, don't do this!

1433
01:20:51,555 --> 01:20:53,057
不可思议
Unbelievable.

1434
01:20:53,223 --> 01:20:55,976
- 我够不到扳机  - 派特 别这样
- I can't reach the trigger.  - Pat, come on.

1435
01:21:00,981 --> 01:21:02,983
你能帮我吗?
Would you do it for me?

1436
01:21:04,068 --> 01:21:06,287
是啊 当然 伙计
Yeah, course I will, mate.

1437
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:09,790
我当然会帮你
Course I will.

1438
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:14,332
都结束了 派特
It's over, Pat.

1439
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:17,457
不会再有人受伤了
No more hurting.

1440
01:21:18,374 --> 01:21:19,671
噢!
Ow!

1441
01:21:19,833 --> 01:21:20,959
啊!
Aaargh!

1442
01:21:22,336 --> 01:21:24,680
你们这帮蠢货!
You fucking idiot!

1443
01:21:26,507 --> 01:21:27,724
该死的
Shit.

1444
01:21:28,842 --> 01:21:32,642
- 别睡过去 阿兰 别睡过去  - 琳 他们把我炸碎了
- Stay with me, Alan. Stay with me.  - They've blown me to bits, Lynn.

1445
01:21:33,097 --> 01:21:34,690
我觉得好冷
I feel cold.

1446
01:21:35,808 --> 01:21:39,062
没事的 阿兰 上帝与我们同在
It's all right, Alan. God is with us.

1447
01:21:39,228 --> 01:21:41,481
琳 我们有过疯狂的时光 对吗?
We had some mad times, didn't we, Lynn?

1448
01:21:42,564 --> 01:21:45,659
琳 我吐血了
There's some blood coming from my mouth, Lynn.

1449
01:21:46,193 --> 01:21:49,493
- 口水而已  - 是吗? 没错
- It's just spit.  - Is it? Oh, yeah.

1450
01:21:49,655 --> 01:21:51,999
- 阿兰 我很抱歉  - 没事 派特
- Alan, I'm really sorry.  - It's all right, Pat.

1451
01:21:52,157 --> 01:21:54,251
- 你还拿着枪!  - 啊!
- You've still got the gun!  - Aargh!

1452
01:21:57,037 --> 01:21:59,881
琳 我是个好人吗? 我是个善良的人吗?
Was I a good man, Lynn? Was I a kind man?

1453
01:22:00,207 --> 01:22:02,050
你很善良
Very kind.

1454
01:22:02,209 --> 01:22:06,555
我还记得你给冰箱除霜 然后送给我一整块培根
I remember when you were defrosting your freezer and you gave me all that bacon.

1455
01:22:07,464 --> 01:22:09,011
我准备好了 琳
I'm ready, Lynn.

1456
01:22:09,216 --> 01:22:11,935
我想我准备好了
I think I'm ready.

1457
01:22:12,094 --> 01:22:14,313
哦 你好 海鸥先生

1458

你是来带走我的灵魂吗?
Have you come to take my spirit away?

1459
01:22:17,182 --> 01:22:19,685
走吧 海鸥!

What are you doing? I'm watching it fly off.

1464
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:54,141
真奇怪 琳 你是我见过的最后一个人
It's weird, Lynn. Yours will be the last face I ever see.

1465
01:22:55,471 --> 01:22:57,690
- 噢 很好  - 嗨 听着 你会没事的
- Oh, good.  - Hi there. You're gonna be OK.

1466
01:22:57,848 --> 01:23:00,897
- 我被射中心脏了  - 你的心脏在那儿 这是肩膀
- I've been shot in the heart.  - Your heart's there. That's your shoulder.

1467
01:23:01,059 --> 01:23:03,187
不 那... 那是我的心脏 噢!
No, that... that's my heart. Ow!

1468
01:23:03,395 --> 01:23:06,069
- 我能回来工作吗?  - 是的 只要你愿意
- Can I have my job back now?  - Yeah, if you want.

1469
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:15,540
# 可能我对你的爱不够 #
# Maybe I didn't love you #

1470
01:23:15,699 --> 01:23:18,248
你当医生多久了?
How long have you been a paramedic?

1471
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:20,162
- 差不多四年了  - 很好
- About four years.  - Right.

1472
01:23:20,329 --> 01:23:23,299
你开始在圣约翰急救中心 然后慢慢被提拔上来
And do you start in St John's Ambulance and then work your way up

1473
01:23:23,457 --> 01:23:25,050
还是他们本来就是独立的部门?
or are they separate organisations?

1474
01:23:25,209 --> 01:23:27,883
- 他们本来就是独立的部门  - 我想听她说呢 琳
- They're separate organisations.  - She can answer for herself, Lynn.

1475
01:23:28,045 --> 01:23:30,468
- 他们是独立的部门  - 好的
- They are separate organisations.  - Right.

1476
01:23:30,672 --> 01:23:32,345
- 你在拍拖吗?  - 好吧...
- Are you courting?  - Well...

1477
01:23:32,508 --> 01:23:33,555
我不是问你 琳!

01:23:33,759 --> 01:23:37,730
北诺福克最棒的音乐电台
North Norfolk's best music mix.

1479
01:23:37,930 --> 01:23:40,353
我们有封来自塞特福德露易丝的信
We've had a letter from Louise in Thetford,

1480
01:23:40,516 --> 01:23:44,817
信里写道 "人们一拿土地公公开玩笑 我就牙疼"
who says, "I'm sick to the back teeth of people poking fun at garden gnomes."

1481
01:23:44,978 --> 01:23:47,265
他们也许很矮 长得也有点奇怪
They may be small and strange-faced, but they

1482
01:23:47,278 --> 01:23:49,575
但他们会给人们带来很多欢乐
bring a lot of pleasure to a lot of people.

1483
01:23:49,733 --> 01:23:53,033
瞧 很久以前的我很觉得这封信很冒犯人 很愚蠢
Now, that's a letter, once upon a time I would have found offensively dull.

1484
01:23:53,195 --> 01:23:54,321
- 是的  - 现在不会了
- Yeah.  - Not now.

1485
01:23:54,488 --> 01:23:56,911
也许发生的一切改变了你
So maybe everything that happened has changed you.

1486
01:23:57,074 --> 01:23:58,792
我也觉得我变了一点点
I think I have changed a little bit.

1487
01:23:58,951 --> 01:24:01,329
对我来说 我有点担心我的脑袋...
Well, for my part, I was a bit worried about my head...

1488
01:24:01,495 --> 01:24:02,712
- 又来了  - 不过...
- Here we go.  - But um...

1489
01:24:02,913 --> 01:24:06,634
- 我想我已经能应付了  - 噢 没错 这笑话还不赖
- I think I've got a handle on it now.  - Oh, yeah, that's a good joke.

1490
01:24:07,334 --> 01:24:09,757
你现在每天要把这笑话讲好几遍
You've used that joke about three or four times now.

1491
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:12,343
- 我不知道你意识到没有  - 我有一直讲吗?
- I don't know if you're aware of that.  - I use it too much?

1492
01:24:12,506 --> 01:24:16,010
我可没这么说 我想我们已经到了... 你懂的
I wouldn't say that. I just think we're in that area and... you know.

1493
01:24:16,176 --> 01:24:18,178
- 帽子怎样?  - 我觉得还是丢掉吧
- What about the hat?  - Good for the bin, I reckon.

1494
01:24:18,345 --> 01:24:20,143
- 丢掉?  - 是的
- Lose it?  - Yeah.

OK, this week's question comes from Sue, a dental hygienist from Grantham.

1505
01:24:49,084 --> 01:24:52,179
她问你 "监狱时间一般指喝粥时间"
She asks, "Prison time is often referred to as porridge"

1506
01:24:52,337 --> 01:24:57,389
他们真的会供应粥吗 如果真有 是不是强制得喝?"
but do they actually serve porridge, and if so, is it compulsory?"

1507
01:24:57,551 --> 01:25:00,725
是的 他们会供应粥 但你也可以吃别的
Yeah, they serve porridge but you can have other things.
