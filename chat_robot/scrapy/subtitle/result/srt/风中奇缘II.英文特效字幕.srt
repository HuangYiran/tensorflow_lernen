{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I'm sorry. It's my fault.

111
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:51,030
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- This horse, it's meant for...  - Pocahontas, your king said.

112
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,500
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Or did he speak falsely?  - No! Never.

113
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,500
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just that... This is...

114
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:01,170
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, this is... This is perfectly fine.

115
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,550
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good job, Rolfe.

116
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,550
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I believe we can prosper together in this great land

117
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,510
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}under King James' gracious rule.

118
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,770
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To build trust, I would like you to sail back with me...

119
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,560
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- ...to meet my king.  - I do not want the pale chief's land.

120
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:24,360
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He wants mine.

121
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,400
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why doesn't he cross the salt water to see me?

122
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:32,160
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm afraid that simply isn't done, Your Grand "Chiefliness."

123
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,790
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your kind are barbarians. They only want our land!

124
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:39,080
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- They mean to destroy our sacred...  - Is that what they want?

125
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,580
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't know.

126
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:46,250
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Father, someone must go.

127
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,800
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You speak with the tongue of a pale one.

128
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:52,010
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You belong with them. Perhaps you should go.

129
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:55,560
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! This is a matter of diplomacy.

130
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,430
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't handle a job like this.

131
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:03,150
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I will go.  - Daughter...

132
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:06,610
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Father, please. I can do this.

133
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:12,530
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have your mother's spirit.

134
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:16,080
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Very well. It is decided.  - But...

135
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,870
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grand.

136
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,730
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grandmother Willow, I need to speak with you.

137
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,530
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that my Pocahontas?

138
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:02,290
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My, what is it, child?

139
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:06,830
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are concerned about crossing the salt water.

140
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,840
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What if I can't bring peace?

141
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,510
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What if I'm destined to fail? What if I make things worse?

142
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,680
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What if?  - What if I can't make them listen?

143
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:18,010
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What if the sky turns to fire and your nose falls off?

144
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:23,600
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Long ago, I told you to listen with your heart.

145
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:27,400
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is time to listen to your heart.

146
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,440
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But the spirits around me...

147
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:35,030
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can help, but only the spirit within can guide you.

148
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:46,420
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen to the spirit within.

149
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,240
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grandmother Willow, it doesn't work.

150
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,580
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grandmother Willow?

151
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,340
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Easy up, men!

152
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,850
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here we go. Right-o. Over here.

153
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,850
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Easy.  - To the starboard.

154
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:45,850
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hoist away!

155
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:50,190
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I will honour my vow not to break the peace with the pale ones,

156
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,730
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but we must know their strength.

157
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:57,490
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cut a notch in this staff for every pale face you see.

158
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,240
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Watch over my daughter.

159
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:35,360
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't take you this time.

160
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:42,240
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stay out of mischief and look after one another.

161
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:18,820
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do not forget this land.

162
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:21,030
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You will always be with me.

163
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:01,150
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait. What's this?

164
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,320
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is Uttamatomakkin.

165
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:08,530
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, is Utta... Is he coming with us? Are you coming with us?

166
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,660
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I say, are you...? Hello? Can you hear me?

167
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,370
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can he, can he hear me?

168
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,430
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, of course. This was a good idea, wasn't it?

169
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:27,050
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This will be fine. Fantastic.

170
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,310
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All hands, up anchor!

171
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,390
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anchor ahoy!

172
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,190
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Undo the sails!  - Aye, sir!

173
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,950
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anah, Father.

174
00:21:56,310 --> 00:22:01,060
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, of course, yes. Swab the deck. Swab the deck.

175
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:04,940
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, that's all we do around here, is swab the bloody deck.

176
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,900
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, it is always clean anyway.

177
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:10,700
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, what are we swabbing the deck for?

178
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:14,790
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It looks clean to me down here. I don't see any dirt.

179
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,500
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...swabbing the deck. I'm swabbing!

180
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:24,130
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did anybody notice I'm swabbing?

181
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,550
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey! What is that? What's going...?

182
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,770
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get him! That's it!

183
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:52,280
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Meeko, what are you doing here?

184
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,260
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's all this then?

185
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:12,930
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, missy, I don't cotton to stowaways,

186
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,640
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I'll not have you disrupting my crew.

187
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:17,930
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can take this voyage below...

188
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:22,440

190
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,820
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and is to be treated as such. Am I clear, Captain?

191
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why would you do that?

192
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,700

343
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,650
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our meeting with the king has been corrupted.

{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think I'll put on some tea.

532
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:58,260
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What am I to do?

533
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:05,350
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who are you?

534
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:07,480
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you want?

535
00:51:27,370 --> 00:51:29,540
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Halt! Who goes there?

536
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:32,330
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}John Rolfe. I have a prisoner.

537
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:39,720
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Open the gate.

538
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:55,770
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's escaping! Catch him!

539
00:51:58,440 --> 00:51:59,990
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now find her, Flit.

540
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:41,610
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Flit!

541
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:46,160
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}John! I knew you'd come!

542
00:52:50,330 --> 00:52:52,250
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no time. We must go.

543
00:52:59,550 --> 00:53:00,920
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}John Smith?

544
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:06,300
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought you were dead.

545
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:09,430
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Greatly exaggerated.  - I'll look this way!

546
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:10,760
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go!

547
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,140
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There!

548
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:25,780
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Enjoy the accommodations.

549
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,780
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll take care of it.

550
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:40,500
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pardon me.

551
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:47,680
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, very stylish.

552
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,940
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Riding or running?  - After them. They're getting away!

553
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:04,490
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Close the gate!

554
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,960
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Blast it! They got away!

555
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:35,390
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happened to you?

556
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:37,810
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ratcliffe convinced the king I was the traitor.

557
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:41,150
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I had to stay hidden, let them continue to believe that I was dead.

558
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:43,820
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I missed you so much.

559
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:45,690
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've thought of you every day.

560
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:49,700
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All this time. Why didn't you ever write to me?

561
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:53,410
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wanted to. I must have started a thousand letters.

562
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:57,370
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pocahontas, all that matters is that we're together again.

563
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:01,580
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about my people?

564
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:03,960
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Once the armada sails, they won't stand a chance.

565
00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:05,920
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How will her getting killed save them?

566
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:08,010
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, are you suggesting she turn her back on them?

567
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:11,720
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Are you suggesting she die for them?  - She can't just sit back and watch.

568
00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:15,010
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- She has no choice!  - Of course she has a choice!

569
00:55:16,430 --> 00:55:17,770
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pocahontas!

570
00:55:35,990 --> 00:55:38,330
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Let her go.  - You may not care about her safety...

571
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:41,290
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you dare tell me I don't care about her!

572
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,050
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You love her.

573
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:06,690
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do not forget this land.

574
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:25,040
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}# In some new place on some new face I've never seen #

578
00:56:42,390 --> 00:56:44,940
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen to the spirit within.

579
00:56:45,810 --> 00:56:50,530
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}# Who knows where I go from here? #

580

583
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:05,210
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}# The past is gone #

584
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:08,540
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}# I must move on #

585
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:14,970
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}# From here #

586
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:35,110
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm going back.  - They'll hang you.

587
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,950
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then I will be but the first to fall.

588
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:41,290
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're not going to listen to you. Look at you.

589
00:57:41,450 --> 00:57:44,750
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How can they respect my culture if they haven't seen it?

590
00:57:44,910 --> 00:57:47,210
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is insane! Nuts!

591
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:49,420
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell her she's crazy.

592
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:53,510
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're crazy.

593
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:00,720
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought you may need whatever power this holds for you.

594
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:04,890
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think it's time you taught society a lesson.

595
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:06,980
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have decided.

596
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:19,820
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hear ye! Hear ye!

600
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:43,180
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Surely His Majesty would not refuse an audience

00:58:43,350 --> 00:58:45,060
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with a visiting princess.

00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:46,810
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}James.

603
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:56,110
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your Grace, if you insist on war,

604
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:59,360
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}my people will fight to the last warrior.

605
00:58:59,530 --> 00:59:01,870
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There is nothing to be gained,

606
00:59:02,030 --> 00:59:04,990
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but much to be lost, for all of us.

607
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:07,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There is no gold, is there?

608
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:10,920
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No. Ratcliffe assured me...  - That I was dead?

609
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:13,130
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Was it true?

610
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:18,380
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ratcliffe has lied to you about everything.

611
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:28,270
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There are many voices around you, but you must listen to your own voice.

612
00:59:28,430 --> 00:59:31,140
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why do you speak out when so many doubt you,

613
00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:34,110
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}even when it could mean your life?

614
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:36,820
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because I speak the truth.

615
00:59:40,070 --> 00:59:41,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Silence!

616
00:59:42,070 --> 00:59:44,950
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ratcliffe has left. We must stop him!

617
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:48,580
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- But it's too late.  - We must try.

618
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:57,050
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are the best soldiers in the civilised world.

619
00:59:57,210 --> 01:00:01,550
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We sail to scour the world of the savage vermin.

{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you with me?

621
01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:06,510
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Riders approaching!

622
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:10,600
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Smith!

623
01:00:12,270 --> 01:00:13,650
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Raise anchor! Cast off!

624
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:16,190
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Lift anchor!  - Drop the main sail!

625
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:23,660
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's John Smith!  - I thought he was dead!

626
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:28,490
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm the ghost of John Smith. Run for your lives!

627
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:03,820
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who started the party without me?

628
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:11,370
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You call this a party?  - You're not having any fun?

629
01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:43,820
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Drop the anchor!

630
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hard to port!  - Bring her about! Bring her about!

631
01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:53,870
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Prepare to crash!

632
01:02:07,430 --> 01:02:10,220
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now I can finally get rid of you, you savage!

633
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:13,560
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mind if I cut in?

634
01:02:23,190 --> 01:02:24,650
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Trying to make a point?

635
01:02:39,790 --> 01:02:43,300
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please, don't hurt me, Smith. I was just doing my duty.

636
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:44,500
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sheath your sword.

637
01:02:44,670 --> 01:02:47,880
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Surely you know that a good soldier always follows orders.

638
01:02:48,050 --> 01:02:52,260
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If it were I, I would have killed you years ago.

01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:56,640
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As I was saying, I never liked you, Smith.

640
01:02:56,810 --> 01:02:59,980
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hereby sentence you to death.

641
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:01,980
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Goodbye, Smith.

642
01:03:08,070 --> 01:03:10,450
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Very stylish.  - I learned it from the best.

643
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:15,040
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pity. I so would have preferred to see you hang.

644
01:03:40,770 --> 01:03:43,060
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your Majesty, the fugitives are getting away!

645
01:03:43,230 --> 01:03:45,940
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They've sabotaged the armada. Stop them!

646
01:03:46,780 --> 01:03:49,440
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No more lies.

647
01:03:50,450 --> 01:03:52,240
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Arrest him.

648
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:04,630
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- John Smith, what a heroic return.  - Why, thank you, my lady.

649
01:04:04,790 --> 01:04:07,380
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- How did you escape?  - We thought you were dead.

650
01:04:07,550 --> 01:04:08,960
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bravo, John!

651
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:23,940
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lord Advisor to the Royal Court.

652
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:25,770
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What a wonderful honour.

653
01:04:28,690 --> 01:04:30,860
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's what you've always wanted.

654
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:36,160
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you, you've done everything you've set out to do...

655
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:37,950
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and more.

656
01:04:40,790 --> 01:04:42,580
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your people will be very proud.

657
01:04:45,290 --> 01:04:48,840
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. It will be good to see them again.

658
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:51,460
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, perhaps one day you'll return to London.

659
01:04:52,510 --> 01:04:53,590
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Pocahontas...  - John...

660
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:56,180
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The king has given me a ship! This is my dream!

661
01:04:57,180 --> 01:05:01,390
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ours. Every day a new adventure. New lands to discover.

662
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:05,690
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll chart a new course. And you'll be at my side, naturally.

663
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:07,810
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A ship of our own!

664
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:11,940
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll put a crew together immediately! We'll set sail right away!

665
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:14,280
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

666
01:05:16,490 --> 01:05:18,830
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not what you want, is it?

667
01:05:19,910 --> 01:05:22,620
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We walked the same path once.

668
01:05:22,790 --> 01:05:25,330
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have found where I belong.

669
01:05:27,130 --> 01:05:30,210
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hope you will also find happiness.

670
01:05:30,380 --> 01:05:33,800
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}May the Great Spirit always be with you.

671
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:10,500
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pocahontas? Pocahontas!

672
01:06:13,170 --> 01:06:15,510
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Look smart, men!  - I don't see anything.

673
01:06:18,890 --> 01:06:23,010
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Mrs.Jenkins!  - Oh, there you are, dear.

{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mrs.Jenkins, thank you so much for everything.

676
01:06:31,940 --> 01:06:35,030
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Is John Rolfe here?  - I haven't seen him, dear.

677
01:06:35,190 --> 01:06:40,030
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought he was with you. Maybe he hates goodbyes as much as I do.

678
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:42,030
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Goodbye, dear.

679
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:07,350

{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}John!

681
01:07:13,110 --> 01:07:15,110
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about your duty to the king?

682
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:18,650
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have a duty to honour what is in my heart, Pocahontas.

683
