當時已經是我到球隊後的第二還是第三場主場比賽了
Jeremy lin: So it was like my second or third home game,

8
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,170
我甚至還從未上過場
And I hadn't even been in a game yet,

9
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,440
當我試圖進入球館時
And I had tried to get in the gym,

10
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,740
他們攔住我
And they stopped me.

11
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,670
他們說
And they were like,

12
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,280
「抱歉，這裏是球員入口」
"oh, sorry, this is the players' entrance."

13
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,780
我說，「我知道啊」
I was like, "I know."

14
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,410
那個保安就困惑地看著我
He looked at me confused,

15
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,580
於是我也困惑地看著他
And then so I was looking at him confused.

16
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,250
然後他說
And then he was like,

17
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,620
「哦，抱歉，你是隊上的訓練師嗎？」
"oh, I'm sorry. Are you a trainer?"

18
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,820
我站在那不知道說什麼好
And I was just kind of just like standing there.

19
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,290
然後另一個保安走過來
And then another security guard came over

20
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,430
對著之前那個耳語道，「他應該是在隊上打球的」
And, like, whispered, "I think he plays on the team."

21
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,330
現在上場的是後衛...
At guard it's...

22
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:15,940
十七號，林書豪！
Number 17, jeremy lin!

23
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,140
書豪
Hey, jeremy.

24
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,540
Hi.

25
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,880
沒有人認為他會打球
Nobody thought he could play.

26
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,780
他需要為所得的一切而戰
He had to fight for everything that he got.

27
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,920
你很少能有這種感覺：你見證了
It's not often you think you've seen something

28
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,690
聯盟中罕見的奇跡
You couldn't possibly see in the nba.

29
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:36,820
林投籃！
Lin puts it up!

30
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,230
進了！
Bang!

31
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,460
等等，這小子是誰？
Wait a minute. Who's this kid?

32
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,530
等等，他從哪冒出來的？
Wait. Where's he from?

33
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:42,600
等等，落選秀？
Wait. Not drafted?

34
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,800
等等，被多少球隊裁掉過？
Wait. How many teams waived him?

35
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,370
當他打球時
When this guy is playing,

36
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,270
勇士隊不知道他這麼棒
And golden state doesn't know he's any good,

37
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,840
火箭隊不知道他這麼棒
Houston doesn't know he's any good,

38
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,900
我不得不想，難道是因為
I got to imagine that something has to do with

39
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,670
他看上去不像個打球的好手
He doesn't look the part.

40
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,210
林書豪從默默無聞走到偉大
Jeremy lin came from nothing to greatness.

41
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:59,180
嘿，這小子給所有孩子以希望
Hey, this kid is giving hope to all those kids

42
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,280
那些認為自己永遠不會有機會的孩子
That think, "never could I have a chance."

43
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,190
我一直對自己說，我的進步歷程會是這樣
I always told myself my progression is gonna be

44
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,650
從進入輪換，到成為首發控衛
Become a rotation player, become a starting point guard,

45
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,460
然後贏得NBA總冠軍
And then win an nba championship.

46
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:13,530
人們聽到後肯定會嘲笑我
And people are definitely gonna laugh when they hear that.

47
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,060
但是有朝一日這一切成真時
You know, they're not gonna be laughing

48
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,460
他們就不會再笑了
If it actually happens.

{\pos(638,506)}48個小時內，林書豪就會被裁掉
很可能就此終結他的NBA事業
並結束他的一生夢想

51

防守！
De-fense!

尼克斯隊的山姆波特，個人第二次犯規
New york foul is on shumpert, his second.

54
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,830
現在他得下場休息會兒了
And now, he'll have to take a seat,

55
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,390
看看誰要上場了
And, again, mike, look who's coming in.

56
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,130
是林書豪，你可以聽到球迷的大聲歡呼
Jeremy lin, and you hear a pretty big ovation.

57
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,910
我知道是神在安排這一切
Jeremy: I know god orchestrated this whole thing.

58
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,140
因為太多事情在我的掌控之外
There's just too much out of my control.

59
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:10,880
而且它們發生的方式是那樣的不可思議
And just the way it happened is just miraculous.

60
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,590
書豪！
Jeremy!

61
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,460
是真的
It's actually true.

62
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:28,600
在我大概八、九歲後
After, I think, age maybe 8 or 9,

63
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,140
我們換掉了電視
We got rid of the tv,

64
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,310
我們會在季後賽時看比賽
And we would just get it during the playoffs.

65
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,780
我們會在家看
We would watch it in the house

66
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,180
然後在後院
And then, in the backyard,

67
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,540
有扇玻璃門，外面有個籃筐
There's a glass door and a hoop outside,

68
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,780
我們會在外面透過窗子看
So we would just watch through the window,

69
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,580
然後在場間休息或是暫停時
And then any time there was,like, a break or a time-out,

70
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,690
我們會出去模仿
We'd go out, and we'd do the exact move

71
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,290
剛剛球場上出現過的動作
That just happened.

72
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,060
基本上就全部都是模仿喬丹
And it was pretty much all just copying michael jordan

73
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,060
並且看到他取得勝利
And watching him win.

74
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,460
我們熱愛那種觀看比賽的方式
And so we loved watching basketball that way,

75
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,260
那一直是我的一個夢想
And it was always a dream of mine,

76
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,930
但我從未想過它會變成現實
But I didn't actually think it would be a reality.

77
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,230
你在哪搞到這個的？
Where did you get this done?

78
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,870

是嗎？在格林威治村？
Down town.
Oh, yeah? Down in the village?

79
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,270
來看看這個
Can you take a look? Look at this.

80
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,870
讓我看看..背上這是..

我在想說，我看籃球看了這麼多，特別是NBA

98
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,800
那我就開始練習打籃球

99
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,800
我自己練習了五年，像怎麼運球，怎麼投籃

100
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,250
怎麼上籃，我自己練了五年各式各樣的

而且我特別喜歡練習的就是賈巴爾的勾手

因為這是我習慣的角色
Just because it's just what I'm used to.

也許我在聯盟中會打得不錯

但人們會說

"oh, but he can't play well in this league."

Every time jeremy play against somebody who people say is good,

如果書豪打得更好
If jeremy played better,

Why he was a great leader on the court,

哇，看這個
Yeah, dang, look at that.

Look at this. 10 bucks.

他們會發現
They just realize he's just...

405
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,920
他就是個普通人
You know, he's human.

413
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:28,990
第一天上課
My first day at class,

414
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:31,120
我被徹底嚇著了
I was just super-intimidated.

415
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:33,290
我去參加數學分班測驗
I went and took my math placement test,

416
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:36,430
他們說，如果你不會做
And they were like, "if you don't know how to do this,

417
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:38,900
可以交卷走人
Feel free to turn it in and leave."

418
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,970
我看著試卷，心想
I looked at it and I was, like,

419
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:42,770
天吶，我啥也看不懂
"dude, I don't know what's going on here."

420
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:45,340
於是我交了卷
So I turned it in, and I was,

421
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:48,140
我大概是第二個交卷的
Like, maybe the second person who turned it in.

422
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,510
我心想，天，我在哈佛的
I was like, "man, I just, like,

423
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,940
第一場測驗就掛了
Failed my first test at harvard."

424
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:56,420
第二天，我們進行中文分班測驗
The next day, we had the chinese placement test,

425
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,180
然後他們說
And they gave us the test, and they're like,

426
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,090
如果你讀不懂，可以交卷
"if you can't read it, just turn it in."

427
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:04,990
我讀不懂啊，就又交卷了
I couldn't read it, so I turned it in again,

428
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:06,830
那是連續兩次測驗掛掉
And that was back-to-back failed tests

429
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,660
我甚至一個答案都寫不出
Without even filling in an answer.

430
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:13,630
我在電話裏跟我媽媽說
I called my mom, I was like, "man,

431
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,070
以後估計很難熬了，要做好心理準備
This is gonna be pretty tough, so just get ready."

432
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:23,310
很大程度上，林書豪去哈佛
In a lot of ways, jeremy lin going to harvard

433
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,980
是符合邏輯的
Was a very logical thing.

434
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:30,050
哈佛有23名
There were 23 asian-americans at harvard

435
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:32,150
姓林的亞裔學生
Whose last name was lin.

436
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:34,020
所以林進入哈佛
And so for jeremy lin to show up at harvard,

437
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,390
作為亞裔的孩子
Being this asian-american kid,

438
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:39,090
數學成績好
Who had a perfect math sat ii score was,

439
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:41,060
你也知道，並不少見
You know, nothing rare.

440
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:44,760
但是他打籃球很厲害的這個事實（卻很特別）
But the fact that he was amazing at this game,

441
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:48,730
問題是他如何融入哈佛？
The question was then how did he fit in at harvard?

442
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,240
湯米·艾默科
There is tommy amaker,

443

1987年畢業於杜克大學（籃球名校）
1987 graduate of duke, of course,

444
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,370

已經有11年的主教練經驗

And jeremy was leading the charge.{\i}

456
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,770
我知道我們有些特別的因素
We knew we had something pretty interesting,

457
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:26,140
特別是林書豪
Especially with jeremy,

458
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:28,410
因為首先他訓練特別刻苦
Because of how hard he worked, first of all,

459
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:30,780
而且籃球對他而言非常重要
And how important basketball was to him.

460
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:31,980
還有就是他的天賦
And then his talent.

461
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,280
我認為他被大大地低估了
I think he was very much underrated,

462
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,950
我認為他想按照

也就是高能量的風格

他的球風很強硬

侵略性強，無所畏懼

林書豪斷球
A steal by jeremy lin.

輕鬆扣籃

532
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,350
以最不可思議的方式！
In the most improbable fashion!

533
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,880
不敢相信！
I don't believe it!

534
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,290
我小時候
When I was growing up,

535
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,060
參加AAU的比賽
I was playing in the aau tournaments.

536
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,560
我們比賽的時候
We would play in games,

537
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,000
有時候，人們會說
And a couple of times, people would be like,

538
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,930
「喲，滾回到中國去」
"yo, take your ass back to china,"

539
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:07,430
或者說：「你就是個中國貨」之類的
Or like, "you're a chinese import," or whatever.

540
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,400
上了大學以後，這些攻擊更離譜了
When I got to college, it just, like, got crazy.

541
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,640
比如說：「中國佬！」
It was just like, "you chink!"

542
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,340
什麼「你能張開眼睛嗎？」
You know, "can you even open your eyes?

543
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,540
你看得見分數牌嗎？
Can you see the scoreboard?"

544
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,110
這種亂七八糟的東西
You know, just like crazy stuff.

545
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:19,880
我心想：這都什麼跟什麼啊？
And I'd just be like, "dude, like, what is going on?"

546
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:22,580
{\i1}身處目光的焦點中
Being in the spotlight{\i}

547
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,550
{\i1}為林書豪帶來不可避免的副產物
Brought jeremy an inevitable byproduct:{\i}

548
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:29,090
{\i1}關注，有正面的，也有負面的
Attention, both positive and negative.{\i}

549
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:33,030
人們在看籃球運動員時
I mean, people look at basketball players in terms of...

550
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:34,990
如果用種族的角度去看
Of race a lot of times.

551
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,030
在美國，籃球往往被視為
Basketball is not considered

552
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:39,270
不是給亞裔玩的運動
An asian sport here in america.

553
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,370
我們打客場時
We'd be playing on the road,

554
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:41,900
在常春藤的某個體育館裏
Specific gyms in the ivy league,

555
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:45,540
他們會向他喊一些種族歧視的髒話
And they would yell racial slurs to him.

556
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,210
在常春藤聯盟，看到種族歧視的辱罵
It was shocking to me to see racial taunts

557
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:48,540
讓我很驚訝
In the ivy league,

558
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,880
到了這個級別
Because you think that at that level,

559
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,810
當然你會認為
Certainly in the supposed, you know,

560
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:56,980
學術氛圍應該很濃厚
Very academically progressively oriented

561
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:00,620
這些校園裏會有很多亞裔的學生
Group of schools full of asian students on their campuses

562
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:03,420
種族歧視的侮辱應該是不可想像的
That that would be something that was unthinkable,

563
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,220
但事實並非如此
But it wasn't.

564
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,830
我告訴他，這是一種重視的表現
I just told him, it's a sign of respect.

565
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:09,300
是，他們很無知
Yeah, they're ignorant,

566
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,630
但說到底
But at the end of the day,

567
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:12,200
是他們想要進入你的腦子
They're trying to get in your head.

568
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,130
你在想著他們說的東西
You're thinking about what they saying

569
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,970
而沒有想著比賽
And not thinking about the game.

570
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:26,010
好像是在訓練中
I think we were just working out,

571
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:28,750
我對他說
And kind of was like, you know

572
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,950
書豪，能跟你說句話嗎？
"j, can I speak to you for a moment?"

573
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,220
他讓我坐下
He sat me down,

574
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:37,950
{\pos(935,450)}4.4 助攻/場
4.4 籃板/場
16.4 分/場


總共 1,483 分

575
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,050
坐在體育館外的樓梯上
Like, right outside the gym on the stairs,

576
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,690
他說
And he was like...

577
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:37,490
我不知道有沒有人告訴過你
"I don't know if anybody's ever told you this,

578
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:39,930
但我覺得你可以去打NBA
But I think you can be an nba player."

579
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:42,600
他看著我的表情
And he kind of looked at me like, you know,

580
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,860
就像看到聖誕老人
He just saw santa claus or something.

581
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:47,930
我說，你瘋了吧
You know, I was just like, "you're crazy," you know.

582
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,400
我說，兄弟，你肯定瘋了
I was like, "dude, you are crazy."

583
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,340
我媽媽會說
My mom, you know, would be like,

584
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,080
你可以去打NBA
"you can make it to the nba."

585
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,110
呃，好吧……媽
"all right. Um, okay, mom."

586
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:02,110
這可能嗎？
Is this possible?

587
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,450
我想也許他真的
I thought maybe he really...

588
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:05,420
有這個可能
Really have a chance.

589
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,990
當這個問題被提起
When the question was broached,

590
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:09,150
林書豪是不是有能力進入NBA
Is jeremy lin good enough to make the nba,

591
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:12,390
我想正是從那時開始他對這件事情產生興趣
That's when I think a lot of the interest started surging.

592
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,630
能告訴我這張毯子的來歷嗎？
Can you tell me the history of this blanket?

593
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:19,300
這張毯子來頭可大了
Oh, this blanket is legendary.

594
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,500
是嗎？
Yeah?

595
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,930
上面全是《獅子王》的角色
It's all about {\i1}lion king.{\i}

596
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,300
這裏有娜娜
We have nala right here,

597
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,870
還有小辛巴，丁滿和彭彭
Baby simba, timon and pumbaa.

598
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:28,240
這是我一直以來最喜歡的毯子
This is one of my favorite blankets of all time.

599
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,240
芝麻街那條毯子呢？
What about the {\i1}sesame street blanket?{\i}

600
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,310
不，我第二喜歡的是那條加菲貓的
No. My second favorite is the garfield,

601
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,580
然後才到芝麻街那條
And then {\i1}sesame street.{\i}

602
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:36,520
天……好吧，球迷們
oh, man. All right, fans.

603
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:41,690
晚上好，歡迎來到2010年度選秀
Good evening, and welcome to the 2010 draft

604
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:44,790
來到紐約的麥迪遜花園
At madison square garden in new york city.

605
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:47,730
第一輪，我們也沒抱什麼期望
The first round, we weren't expecting really much of anything.

606
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:49,960
今晚意味著
Tonight marks the realization of a dream

607
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,460
世界上最好的年輕球員夢想成真
For the best young players in the world.

608
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,200
我們都很緊張
We were just all real nervous,

609
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,740
因為他需要克服很多障礙
Just 'cause there were so many odds to overcome for him.

610
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:00,010
狀元簽，華盛頓巫師隊(奇才隊)
And with the first pick, the washington wizards

611
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:03,740
選擇來自肯塔基大學的約翰·沃爾
Select john wall from the university of kentucky.

612
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,050
我確實滿懷著希望，但是說實在話
I was hopeful,but to be completely honest

613
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:10,820
心裏真正想的是：拭目以待到底會發生什麼吧
I was like, "let's just wait and see what happens."

614
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,990
我一直留意著種族問題
The thing that I'm always interested in is race

615
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:17,760
聯盟裏種族歧視這種風氣一直存在
And the way discrimination,you know, rears its ugly head.

616
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,630
我很好奇是否有球隊會嘗試冒險
I was really interested in seeing if a team would take the plunge

617
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:23,600
去選一個美籍亞裔球員
And take this asian-american player.

618
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:26,630
有意思的是
You know, it was funny.

619
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:29,600
我最有機會選上的球隊
Like, the team that I had the highest chance

620
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,670
是尼克斯
To get drafted b was the knicks,

621
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:34,340
因為我在試訓裏打得特別好
cause I crushed that workout.

622
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:39,040
2010 NBA選秀大會第39順位是
With the 39th pick in the 2010 nba draft...

623
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,550
我想「如果在這裏我沒有被選中」
I was like,"if I don'get drafted here

624
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:43,150
我很有可能就不會被任何球隊選了
I probably won't get drafted."

625
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:44,920
紐約尼克斯隊的選擇是
The new york knicks select...

626
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,650
我想「天啊，如果我被選中了我該做些什麼？」
I'm thinking like,"oh, if I get drafted，what's gonna happen?

627
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,760
我應該要圍著會場跑一圈，擁抱每個人嗎？
I'm just gonna run around, like，hugging everyone

628
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,090
明天我就要飛去紐約了
I'm gonna fly to new york tomorrow

629
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:55,460
蘭德裏·菲爾茲，來自斯坦福大學
Landry fields，from stanford university.

630
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:01,830
{\i1}選秀結束後十分鐘
10 minutes{\i}after the draft ended,

631
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,640
{\i1}達拉斯小牛隊的經理唐尼.尼爾森
Donny nelson,{\i\i1}the general manager{\i}

632
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,270
{\i1}親自打電話給林書豪
Of the dallas mavericks,{\i\i1}personally called jeremy{\i}

633
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:09,440
{\i1}讓他為小牛隊夏季聯賽效力
And asked him to play{\i\i1}on his summer league team.{\i}

634
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,510
我想大概每個落選的人
I think everyone who goes undrafted,you know,

635
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:16,480
都會有一種想要證明自己的心情，因為他們覺得自己有實力
Feels like they have to prove themselves,because they do.

636
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,920
因此，這對我而言確實是一個好機會
And so, you know,this is a chance

637
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,490
你在夏季聯賽的賽場
Where you get to play against people

638
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:22,390
每晚跟選秀大會上落選的球員們一起打球
Who are drafted every single night

639
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:24,960
你要在實戰中與他們競爭
And you get to compete with them in practice

640
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,130
而這恰好就是最好的機會
And this is the best opportunity to, you know

641
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:29,430
證明給所有的球隊看
Prove to all the other teams

642
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,900
你是值得被選中的
That you deserved to be drafted

643
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,970
你本來應該得到一份合同
And you deserved to have that contract

644
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:34,700
林書豪，巧妙的進攻
Lin, surprise attack

645
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,000
這將是一場很有看頭的比賽
Oh, this is gonna be interesting

646
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,970
桑德斯在防守，林成功保住這一球！
Sanders there，lin protected it home!

647
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:41,140
哇！漂亮的進球
Wow! Nice play.

648
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:44,380
我希望林書豪能成功
I hoped that jeremy would make it

649
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,180
因為我對他的實力有信心
Because I had confidence in his ability,

650
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,650
但是我疑慮的是
But I was skeptical

651
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:50,320
是否有一處可以讓他真正一展身手的地方
In terms of him getting a real shot anywhere.

652
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,320
林書豪！
Jeremy lin!

653
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,020
接著在夏季聯賽
And then I watched him play

654
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:56,960
我看到了他與沃爾的對決
In the summer league against john wall

655
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,790
我們將看到非常精彩的對位
I think we got a primetime match-up

656
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:01,290
約翰·沃爾，聯盟選秀的狀元
John wall, the number one overall selection

657
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:05,300
沃爾進攻！反手上籃！
Wall, creative!On the reverse.

658
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,700
速度夠快吧？
How fast was that?

659
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:10,600
在比賽前一天我告訴林書豪
I talked to him the day before

660
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,370
他將跟約翰·沃爾對位
He was gonna play against john wall

661
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:14,970
這是你關鍵的一次表現機會
And I told him,"it's your one shot

662
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:18,480
跟沃爾對位你完全沒有問題
There's no doubt that you can play against the guy."

663
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,050
林書豪，單手上籃！
Lin.Lin gettin' up there!

664
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:23,350
林將成為聯盟裏的新寵
He's gonna be an nba crowd favorite

665
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:25,820
在進攻端再次得手
Gotta work on the end.

666
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:28,750
林在右路繞過防守，在他習慣的右路上籃
Lin went right around him on his strong side

667
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,790
林書豪具有
The fact that he could do that

668
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:35,930
與新秀狀元對位的能力，這個事實令人激動
Against the number-one player in the nba draft was tremendous

669
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:39,570
評估，建設性的意見
Assessing,constructive criticism

670
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:41,600
好球！
No way. Man!

671
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,900
如果你激發出他的能力，你會看到意想不到的事情
If you explode on him,you'll have something.

672
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,910
你會看到他身上蘊藏著無限的可能
You're gonna get your opportunity

673
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:49,340
他撕開防守，轉身投籃
As he splits,spins...

674
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,580
太可惜了！裁判為什麼要吹哨子？！
Oh, no, ref!Don't you do that!

675
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,050
觀眾們都站起來了！
They're on their feet!

676
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:56,180
天呀，這恐怕是要引起一場混戰啊
Oh, my god.This is about to be a melee here

677
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,480
拉開他們（解說員開玩笑）
Hold 'em back,hold 'em back!

678
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:01,650
快看，觀眾們已經陷入瘋狂了
Oh, look it, the crowd is going crazy!

679
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,990
他改變了一些人的狹隘眼光
He's opened some eyes

680
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:05,060
如果林不再留在小牛為夏季聯賽效力
And if lin doesn't stick with the mavs

681
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,260
會有球隊看著他的表現，心想
There are teams out there that are looking at him saying,

682
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,060
天吶，他完全推翻了我們的觀念
"boy, he beats their system very nicely."

683
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:11,030
不管他今年是否留在夏季聯賽
Whether he's in the league this year or not

684
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:12,360
都會有幾支球隊想要他的
He'll have some options

685
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,700
是的，會有幾支球隊想要他的
Oh, he will have some options.

686
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,500
我只是一心想要打球
I'm just trying to play

687
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,000
只要有球隊有興趣與我談
And if someone's interested, you know,

688
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:20,670
我非常樂意去爭取機會
I'd love to talk about an opportunity.

689
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:26,650
我的兒子跟林書豪都是組織後衛
Joe lacob: My son and he both were point guards

690
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:28,350
他們在AAU分屬不同的球隊

記得在當地的體育館
And so I remember watching them play

693
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:32,580
我看過他們的AAU比賽
These aau games in these local gyms.

694
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:37,690
當時我跟我的合夥人正好買下了勇士隊
But I just happened to buy the team at that time with my partners.

695
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:39,220
我最早跟總經理說的其中一件事就是
One of the first things I told our gm was,

696
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:42,030
「我知道那個球員，我的兒子也知道他」
"look, I know this kid.My son knows this kid.」

697
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:44,700
他非常有天賦，我們應該給他一個機會「
He's really talented.We ought to give him a shot."

698
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,630
我想他們都覺得我有點瘋了
I think they thought we were a little crazy,

699
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:49,270
但是我們還是那麼做了，當你是老闆
But we did, and, you know,when you're the owner,

700
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:51,000
你就有權利做些瘋狂的事
You get to do things like that

701
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,970
勇士隊球員的平均智商以及籃球智商
The warriors' iq and basketball iq

702
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,310
都上升了一些
Just went up a few points

703
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:59,340
因為他們簽了哈佛畢業的後衛林書豪
They signed harvard guard jeremy lin

704
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,780
我打給林書豪告訴他我們將簽下他
I called jeremy to tell him.

705

林書豪的經紀人

706
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,250
他甚至不相信這是真的
He didn't believe me.

707
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:04,650
他說「別開玩笑了，你是認真的嗎？」
He was like,"stop playing, man.Are you serious?"

708
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:06,850
我說「小伙子，這是真的」
I said,"man, it's for real

709
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:08,590
「明天就來場地練習」
"go down to the practice facility tomorrow

710
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:10,890
「然後簽下合同，很好吧」
And sign the contract.It's good."

711
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:15,590
於是他說「老兄，我待會給你回電！」
And he was like,"man! I'll call you back."

712
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,800
你知道我幾乎不敢相信「天啊」
I was like, "aah!"you know

713
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,530
我叫醒我弟弟
I picked my little brother up,

714
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:22,670
跟他說：金州勇士隊簽我了
I'm like, "I'm signing with golden state!"

715
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:24,000
我又跑到另一個房間
And I ran into the next room,

716
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,700
叫醒我哥哥
I picked my other brother up.

717
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,440
「勇士隊要跟我簽約了！」
"I'm signing with golden state!"

718
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,510
我很難描述是怎樣一種心情
I can't even really describe it

719
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:33,910
因為我們兄弟從小就為NBA著迷
cause we, like, grew up,like, fantasizing about the nba

720
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:37,080
我們從小到大都支持著勇士隊
And, like, the fact that we grew up rooting for the warriors

721
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,920
這一切使書豪進入勇士隊顯得更不可思議
Made it even that much crazier

722
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,890
作為當代的第一位美籍亞裔NBA球員
Lin has a chance to make history

723
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:44,060
林書豪很有機會創造歷史
As the first asian-americannba player in the modern era

724
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:47,190
當他被勇士選中
When he got picked up by warriors

725
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:49,590
那個時刻我們想
That moment,we think

726
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,530
「這就是我希望他做的事情」
"this is what I want him to do."

727
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:53,970
我的夢想就是在NBA打球
My dream was to play in the nba,

728
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:56,470
現在我即將在勇士隊完成我的夢想
And now I get to do it for the warriors

729
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:57,840
我是看著這支球隊的比賽長大的
The team that I grew up watching

730
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,400
所以加入勇士隊的意義比夢想成真還要深遠
It's more than a dream come true

731
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,310
我們都知道觀眾為什麼歡呼，林書豪上場了
We know what that's about

732
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:09,850
林書豪，曾是帕羅奧多高中的學生
Jeremy lin.Palo alto high school's own

733
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,850
畢業於哈佛的勇士新秀
Warrior rookie out of harvard

734
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:15,220
當時我上場的時候球館歡呼聲很大
It got pretty loud

735
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,960
觀眾們站起來為我鼓掌
And people were standing up and clapping

736
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,520
我環顧四周
And I just remember looking around

737
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:20,960
從小是勇士隊的球迷
Grew up a warrior fan

738
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,730
長大後被他家鄉的球隊簽下
Signed by his hometown team

739
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:23,860
這是一個了不起的故事
It's a great story

740
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,400
確實如此
It really is.

741
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,930
我終於來到勇士隊，我終於成為勇士隊的一員
It was so emotional for me to finally get there

742
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,600
這真的讓我感慨良多
For me to finally be there

743
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:34,040
一年前我真的不敢想像我會出現在那裏
And I couldn't envision myself there even a year ago.

744
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:39,040
當我看著他防守科比，我的感覺真的是（難以言喻）「哇~」
When I saw him guarding kobe,I was like, "wow."

745
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:42,810
我們從小就看科比比賽
We've been watching this guy ever since we were little

746
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,320
他現在……居然可以和科比同時在場上
He's actually...He's there.

747
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:51,020
沒進，大衛李拿下籃板球
Missing,lee with the rebound.

748
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:53,190
我喜歡看林控球，不要犯規阻礙他
I love what lin did.Didn't foul him

749
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:55,760

林有一個空檔
Lin's got an open look

752
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:02,330
結果莫名其妙把球傳給了巴蒂爾
And then threw it to battier inexplicably

00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:05,800
歡迎來到NBA

我討厭所有人都盯著我看
I hate when everyone's looking at me

我討厭聚光燈
I hate the spotlight

我如何保持心態做我自己
How am I gonna be myself

期待我帶來不可思議的比賽

00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:21,420
譬如我在場上打球
Like, I was out there playing

763
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,890
但是我並沒有打出自己風格
But I wasn't playing my brand of basketball

我覺得焦慮不安

球隊裏已經有兩個排在他前面的後衛了

And steph curry ahead of him

772

在NBA水準的比賽裏，教練們無疑都想贏球
You know, coaches need to win,at the nba level

773
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,780

確實沒怎麼讓他上場
Really didn't play him a lot

775
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:50,180
事情就是這樣
And this is how these things happen

776
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,520
一開始我告訴自己
At first, I was like,

777
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,990
「他知道我有實力，他知道我可以上場比賽」
"he knows I can play,he knows I can play."

778
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:56,490
可是事實是我基本上沒有機會上場
And then I wasn't playing at all,

779
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:58,060
然後我看到體育新聞裏寫
And then I was, like,reading all these articles like,

780
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,460
「看吧，把他簽進來只是為了多賣幾件球衣」
"oh, he's just here to sell jerseys

781
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,690
「然後增加球隊的收入」
And increase revenue."

782
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,830
我想：也許這就是事實
I was like,maybe that's all it is

也許這就是我在這兒起的作用
Maybe that's all I'm good for, you know

說實話我們得對自己坦誠一些
I think we have to be honest with ourselves

785
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,040
簽林書豪進來肯定是考慮到了市場因素
There was definitely a marketing element to it

786
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,610
我的意思是說他是我們自己家鄉人
I mean,he's a hometown guy

這裏有很大比重的亞裔人口
The area has a significant asian-american population

一切都證明了確實是那樣的

A lot of what america perceives as asian is very foreign

姚明是一個典型的例子
Yao ming was kind of a quintessential example of that

00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:35,860
他來自中國，他來自東方
He's from china, he's from the east

793
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,330
到達我們的海岸
And he's coming to our shores

794
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:39,260
但是林書豪卻不同 ，他是本土產的
Whereas,jeremy is like homegrown

795
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:43,400
他是在美國本土郊外長大的亞裔小孩
He's a homegrown asian-american kid from the suburbs

796
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,200
跟美國其他小孩一樣懷著籃球夢長大
He grew up with hoop dreams just like the rest of us

797
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:48,710
看著像林書豪這樣的孩子在球場上
Seeing a kid like jeremy on the court

798
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:52,380
穿著勇士隊的隊服
In a warriors uniform,

799
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,650
這給我們很大的衝擊
You know,that's a huge impact

800
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:57,550
你知道，他很開心能為自己家鄉的球隊效力
You know, he was happy to be playing for his hometown team

801
00:35:57,550 --> 00:36:03,360
但是，我們並不滿足於只是進入NBA
But we weren't satisfied with just being in the nba

802
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,160
球迷想看到林書豪衝到籃下
Fans want jeremy lin to go all the way to the rim

803
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,460
但是球卻被搶走了
And he has it taken away

804
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,400
{\i1}勇士的管理層
The warriors' management{\i}

805
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,430
{\i1}把林書豪下放到發展聯盟
Sent jeremy{\i} {\i1}down to the d-league{\i}

806
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,940
{\i1}這是NBA的小型聯盟育才體系
The nba's version{\i\i1}of a minor league farm system{\i}

807
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:21,310
{\i1}他面對著殘酷的現實{\i}
{\i1}He was faced with a harsh reality.{\i}

808
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:26,950
發展聯盟是一道難關
The d-league is one of the toughest things

809
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:30,250
對於籃球生涯而言
When it comes to a basketball career.

810
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:32,280
發展聯盟，你懂的，它是個展示的舞台
The d- league, you know, it's a showcase

811
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,150
人們不在乎你贏了多少場
People don't care how many wins you have.

812
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:37,020
他們只在乎你的數據
All they care about is your stats.

813
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,920
一切都只與你自己有關，雖然你有隊友
It's all about you, and you have teammates,

814
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:40,430
但他們其實並不和你站在同一戰線上
But they're not really on your team.

815
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:42,360
如果可以的話，他們會搶了你的飯碗
You know, they'll take your job if they can.

816
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,630
你能搶斷？
You cut off?

817
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:44,800
你是控衛嗎？
You the point guard?

是的
Yeah.

818
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,670
你把球傳給我
You pass it to me...

好的
Okay.

819
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:49,200
然後你就在那兒等著
And then just wait out there.

820
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,400
當他去發展聯盟的時候，我對他說的話很簡單
What I told him when he went to the d-league was simple.

821
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:52,740
把它拿下
Go kill it.

822
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:55,770
去把發展聯盟搞定，然後等著別人給我們打電話
Go and crush the d-league, and let's get called up.

823
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,640
因為這是一場戰役
Because it's a battle, you know.

824
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:01,510
這就是一場意志上的戰役
It's a battle right here.

825
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:05,620
我在想，"天啊，如果我弄砸了"
I was like, "man, like, if I play bad,

826
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,050
我可能就這樣了
This may be it."

827
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:08,590
林書豪奮力帶球
Jeremy lin drives against squeaky,

828
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:11,420
試圖靠近籃架，但把球丟了
to get to the rack, throws it away!

829
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:15,390
我睡不著覺，因為我壓力太大了
I couldn't really sleep, 'cause I was so stressed.

830
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,830
我給我哥哥打電話
I called my brother.

831
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:18,260
我說，「我現在很糾結」
I was like, "I'm trippin' right now,

832
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:20,530
我都不知道這是在幹嘛
Like, I don't know what's going on."

833
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,730
我想，對他來說，就像是這段旅程
I think, for him, it was just like the journey

834
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,070
讓他筋疲力盡了一樣
Was kind of wearing on him.

835
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:25,540
因為這條路上的每一步
'cause, like, at every step of the way,

836
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,040
你都要克服所有這些障礙
You have to, like, overcome all these odds,

837
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,610
我認為，到了某個時間點上
And, like, I think at a certain point,

838
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:31,240
這些障礙讓他感覺不可逾越
It felt insurmountable for him.

839
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:33,550
所以他那個時候狀態不是很好
So he was not in a good place.

840
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:35,210
林需要穩定下來
Lin needs to settle down.

841
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,950
沒錯，他快沒有力氣了
Yeah, he's running out of gas.

842
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:39,250
{\i1}林書豪極力地想要證明{\i}
{\i1}Jeremy desperately wanted to prove{\i}

843
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:41,990
{\i1}他屬於NBA，但在他的新秀賽季{\i}
{\i1}That he belonged, but in his rookie year,{\i}

844
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:44,820
{\i1}他被3次下放到了發展聯盟{\i}
{\i1}He was sent to the d-league three times.{\i}

845
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:49,290
我想他被這樣送來送去
I think getting sent back and forth

846
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,260
這種經常性來回搖擺的效應
And the constant yo-yo effect

847
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,670
源於被勇士隊調回來
Of being taken up by the warriors,

848
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:55,170
又下放回去
Sent back down,

849
00:37:55,170 --> 00:38:00,310
其積累性的結果就是給他沉重的負擔
The cumulative effect of it weighed heavily on him.

850
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:01,770
你知道，我一直有那種渴望
You know, I've always had that desire,

851
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,380
我一直有那種渴望在我心中
And I've always had that within me

852
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,410
證明我能在NBA打球
Where I want to prove that I could play in the nba.

853
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:08,080
但是，你知道，我現在在這裏是有原因的
But, you know, I'm here right now for a reason,

854
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,680
並且，你知道，神以不同的方式在起作用
And, you know, god works in very different ways.

855
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:16,250
保持住！保持住！來這兒！
Stay up! Stay up! Come here!

856
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,990
我覺得隨著每場比賽
You know,I thought with each game,

857
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:19,560
他的自信心都在增強，並且你能看得到
His confidence grew,and you could see it

858
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,990
這幾乎是伴隨著每次場上的持球
Almost with each possession up the floor.

859
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,200
在他打了20場比賽的那段時間之後
And after his 20-game stint,

860
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,200
我覺得他走出了那段發展聯盟經歷的陰影
I think he came out of that d-league experience

大角羊隊主教練（發展聯盟）

開始相信他能在NBA中闖出名堂
Really believing that he could have an impact in the nba.

863
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:33,510
那時候很困難，因為我們知道他能打球
It was tough, because we knew he could play.

864
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:35,610
讓人很沮喪的是，很多人
It was just frustrating because so many people

865
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:40,210
就只想著拋棄他，放棄他
Were so ready to just bury him and give up on him.

866
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:41,350
這對我來說很難
It's hard for me,

867
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:45,950
因為我真的很熱愛籃球
Because I really love basketball.

868
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:48,020
就像是，我愛我的夢想
Like, I love my dream.

869
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,590
我的夢想就是打NBA
My dream is to play in the nba,

870
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:53,560
我太想實現這個夢想了，以致於我都無法想像
And I wanted it so bad that I couldn't imagine

871
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:57,530
在最後快要實現這個夢想的時候，卻又馬上失去了它
Finally getting it, and then losing it right away.

Does anyone in here think lebron is not as good as kobe right now?

873
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,580
我認為詹姆斯當然沒比（科比）強
I think lebron is definitely not better,

874
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,450
他只是更壯實
Just bigger.

875
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:17,780
好吧，這有點難講
Well, it's kind of hard to say.

你比我們知道得更清楚，所以……

不，我也不清楚
No, I don't know.

我寫到，其實我多麼希望
I wrote about how I actually wish

904
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,880
我從來沒有和勇士隊簽約
I had never signed with the warriors.

905
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:26,180
我希望我能放棄籃球，因為我當時無法從中得到樂趣
I wish I could quit basketball, because I wasn't having fun.

906
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:28,150

And what got me through those times--

And that's the type of purpose that he gave me,

922
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:01,550
他一旦賦予我目的性
And once he gave me that purpose,

923
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,290
那就是我獲得內心安寧的時候
Then that's when I had my peace.

924
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:06,360
一旦我獲得安寧，我就獲得了喜悅
And once I got my peace, that's when I got my joy.

925
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:13,970
{\i1}有時候換一種風景{\i}
{\i1}Sometimes a change of scenery{\i}

926
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:15,700
{\i1}可以轉變對人生的看法{\i}
{\i1}Can shift a perspective on life.{\i}

927
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:18,900
對我來說知道我的根是很重要的
My roots is important for me to know,

928
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,440
因為那就代表著我是誰
Because it's who I am.

929
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,910
這是我身份的很大一部分
It's a huge part of my identity.

930
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:25,110
我瞭解我的父母來自哪裏
I understand where my parents came from,

931
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,780
他們是如何在那種文化裏成長的
How they grew up in the culture.

932
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:32,950
哦！你把玩偶弄掉了
Oh! Oh! You dropped it!

933
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:34,450
你把它弄掉了
You dropped it!

934
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:36,450
這就是我每年回來的原因
So that's why I come back every summer

935
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,890
就是為了好好感受一下
Just to get a good feel for that.

936
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:42,730
我為我的身份感到驕傲
I'm very proud to be, you know, who I am.

937
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,710
回到農場
Back on the farm.

938
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,720
我現在還是退後一點吧
Oh, I'm gonna back up a little bit now.

939
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:11,620


940
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:32,080
{\i1}（台語）{\i}

941
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,550
來看看我父親成長的地方
Seeing where my dad grew up,

942
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:35,380
所以40年間可以發生巨大變化
So 40 years makes a huge difference,

943
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:38,520
你知道，從他在這裏成長
You know, from him growing up here

944
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:41,750
到我們在美國成長
To how we grew up in the U.S.

945
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,990
這真的是一個很卑微的起步
It's definitely humble beginnings.

946
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:50,500


947
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:04,680


948
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:17,760
嘿，兄弟，你看到那蝦了嗎？
Hey, man, you see this shrimp?

949
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:24,830
哦，嘿，小心點
Oh, hey, hey. Watch yourself.

950
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:28,900
我的祖父母是在中國出生、長大的
My grandparents are born and raised in china.

951
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,770
我的父母在台灣出生長大
My parents are born and raised in taiwan,

952
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:32,840
我是在美國出生長大
And I was born and raised in the U.S.,

953
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,470
所以這裏面有很多的歷史
And so there's a lot of history

954
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:37,380
在我的身後有很深厚的文化
And a lot of culture behind who I am.

955
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:40,610


956
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:43,150

{i\1}tell me, princess{i\}

958

959
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:52,390

{i\1} I can open your eyes{i\}

966
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,400
你現在要去做什麼？
What are you about to do right now?

967
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,460
我馬上要出去
I'm about to go out here

968
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:36,430
去給一個扣籃大賽當評委
And judge this dunk contest.

969
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,070
這是最後的決賽，冠軍賽
This is the finale, the championship game,

970
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:39,500
為了耐克夏季聯賽
For the nike summer league,

971
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:42,310
所以我現在要去做這個了
So I'm about to get into this right now.

972
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:44,840


973
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,010
他們說我可以講中文
They said I could speak chinese.

974
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:48,980


975
00:44:56,690 --> 00:44:59,060
林書豪！
Jeremy lin!

976
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:04,400
這裏的籃球文化很瘋狂
Basketball culture here is crazy.

977
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,530
球迷們很熱愛籃球
The fans, they love basketball.

978
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:07,770
這裏總有人在打籃球
There's people playing basketball

979
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:10,070
任何時間，在任何球場上
All the time on all the courts.

980
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:12,270
這裏的競賽水平絕對在提升
The level of competition is definitely growing.

981
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:13,840
能有機會看到這些比賽
Got a chance to see some games.

982
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:17,080
所以，你知道，這真是很棒的回歸
So, you know, it's definitely awesome coming back

983
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,740
而且還看到這項運動（籃球）在這個國家進步了這麼多
And seeing how much the sport has grown in the country.

984
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:22,710
準備，預備，開始！
Ready, set, go!

985
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,590
我想來到這裏
I just think coming here,

986
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:33,060
我看到了很多勤奮努力的人
I'm seeing a lot of really diligent, hard workers.

987
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:35,460
我感到所有人都很用功
I feel like everybody works very hard,

988
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:36,830
他們做了所有他們能做的事
And they do everything they can

989
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:38,330
就為了養活他們自己，還有他們的家人
To support themselves and their families,

990
00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:41,030
對於我來說，籃球就是我養活自己和家人的方式
And for me, that way is basketball.

991
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:42,830
我認為勤奮這種精神是根深蒂固的
And I think hard work is definitely ingrained

992
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:46,440
在台灣文化裏，在中國文化裏
In taiwanese culture, in chinese culture.

993
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,970
所以，對我來說，那是一些
And so, for me, that's something

994
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:51,740
我試著去學會並且接受的東西
I try to pick up on and really embrace.

995
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:02,690
喲，兄弟，我們要出發啦
Yo, man, we gotta go.

996
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:04,590
書豪？
Jeremy?

997
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:14,930
在週五早上12點01分
At 12:01 Friday morning,

998
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:17,200
NBA停擺了所有的球員
The nba locked out its players

999
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,270
因為勞資雙方無法在新一輪的集體談判上達成一致
After failing to reach a new collective bargaining agreement.

1000
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:23,780
停擺對很多人有巨大影響
The lockout has a very large impact on a lot of people.

1001
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:25,480
目前放在談判桌上的條件
The current offer that is on the table

1002
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,740
不是我們所能接受的
Is not one that we can accept.

1003
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:27,810
停擺可能是幾個禮拜
It could be a couple weeks,

1004
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:28,950
也可能是幾個月
Could be a couple months.

1005
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:30,280
我們已經聽說
We're already hearing

1006
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:32,150
這將是一個長期的停擺
This is gonna be a very long lockout.

1007
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:36,690
我們將進入NBA的嚴冬
We're about to go into the nuclear winter of the nba.

1008
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:40,760
勞資雙方的工資談判過程
The collective bargaining process

1009
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,490
已經完全破裂
Has completely broken down.

1010
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:43,690
我們都身處其中
We're all in this together.

1011
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:45,060
如果這些球員不給他們
And if these players don't give them

1012
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:46,960
想要的，他們是不會開工的
What they want, they're not going to play.

1013
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,400
我不認為這個問題得到了解決
I don't think it's resolved.

1014
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,070
我覺得這是個很糟的建議
I think it's bad advice.

1015
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:52,800
我其實私下裏
I actually secretly

1016
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,310
希望這次停擺能繼續
Wanted the lockout to continue,

1017
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:57,680
因為這給了我額外的時間去提高
Because it gave me extra time to get better.

1018
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,710
我們願意繼續談判
We are willing to continue discussions

1019
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:01,880
基於一個有可能性的妥協的基礎上
On a potential compromise.

1020
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:03,180
有一些老闆
There are some owners

1021
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:04,850
願意走在這個賽季之前
Who are willing to forego the season.

1022
00:47:04,850 --> 00:47:06,220
我們想要打籃球
We want to play basketball.

1023
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:07,690
那就是我們做的事
That's what we do,

1024
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:09,820
現在，我們沒有一個機會
And right now, we don't have an opportunity

1025
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:11,090
去球場上做我們最擅長的事
To go out and do what we do best.

1026
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:13,220
如果整個賽季都沒了
If we need to lose an entire season,

1027
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:15,130
那也只能這麼幹了
We should go ahead and do it.

1028
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:17,730
我所有浸滿汗水的T恤都在這了
I got all my sweaty t-shirts in here, man.

1029
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:20,100
那太噁心了
That's disgusting.

1030
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:23,370
所以我知道停擺時間越長
So I knew the longer the lockout went,

1031
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:25,770
我就會成為越出色的球員
The better player I would become.

1032
00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:31,010
我們在熱身
We're warming up.

1033
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:33,710
我們只是在熱身
We're just warming up.

1034
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:36,580
就是這樣，那一發很完美
Boom. That's it. That one was perfect.

1035
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:38,650
感覺好嗎？
Feel good?

感覺很好
Feels good.

1036
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:40,420
當他成為一個更好的投手
As he gets better as a shooter,

1037
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:43,960
隨著時間過去，就像錢，錢，錢一樣
Over time it's gonna be like money, money, money.

1038
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:46,490
他只會變得越來越好
He's only gonna get better,

1039
00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:49,590
而且他真的非常好，難道不是嗎？
And he's awfully good now, don't you think?

1040
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,830
要進入他這個腦袋，那是另外一部分
That's the other part, getting into this cranium

1041
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:57,130
讓他相信自己，就像我相信他一樣
To get him to believe like I believe in him.

1042
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:59,440
聖誕快樂，籃球迷們
Merry christmas, basketball fans.

1043
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,840
NBA重新開賽了
The nba is coming back.

1044
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:02,210
球迷們就快得到他們夢寐以求的了
Fans are getting what they want.

1045
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:04,640
老闆們和球員們達成了試行性的協議
Owners and players reached a tentative agreement

1046
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,310
終結了149天的停擺
To end the 149-day lockout.

1047
00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:22,690
進入到我的第二年
Going into my second year,

1048
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:26,460
我沒有
I'm not really, like,

1049
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:28,800
去想任何讓我害怕的事情
Thinking about anything I'm afraid of.

1050
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,100
你知道，我感覺，經歷了我的第一年
You know, I feel like through my first year,

1051
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:33,500
至少在我眼中
At least in my own eyes,

1052
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:36,470
我已經向自己證明，我能在這個水平打球
Like, I proved to myself that I can play at this level.

1053
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:40,140
我想在心態上，我變得更好了
And I think mentally, I'm at a much better place

1054
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:42,610
我能就這樣進去，然後做我自己
Where I'm just going in, and I'm just gonna be myself

1055
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:44,220
打我自己的比賽
And play my own game,

1056
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:46,650
從那個立場來看，我真的一點也不畏懼
And from that standpoint, I'm really not afraid

1057
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:47,890
在進入訓練營後發生的事情
Of anything going into training camp.

1058
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:49,920
我感覺我已經沒有什麼可以失去了
I feel like I have nothing to lose.

1059
00:48:58,030 --> 00:49:01,130
我們缺一個感到滿意的中鋒
We didn't have a center that we felt good about,

1060
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:06,140
我們需要足夠的薪水空間
And we needed to create enough salary cap space

1061
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:07,340
去招攬一個中鋒
To go make an offer,

1062
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:10,740
為了這樣做，我們要裁掉一些球員
And in order to do so, we had to cut somebody.

1063
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:12,880
這是我們做過的決定中
It was one of the hardest decisions

1064
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,710
最艱難的決定之一
That we could have had to make.

1065
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:17,480
他們中途給我打電話
They called me upmidway through

1066
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:18,980
在訓練的中途
In the middle of a drill.

1067
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:20,550
他們說，「嘿，你需要到樓上來一趟」
They're like, "hey, you got to go upstairs."

1068
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:21,950
我走到樓上，然後總經理
I went in there, and the general manager

1069
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,550
和助理總經理說，
And assistant general managerwere like,

1070
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:24,890
「我們得裁掉你」
"we gotta let you go.

1071
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:26,720
「我們想要德安德魯·喬丹」
We're trying to get deandre jordan."

1072
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:31,860
他已經在賽季前付出了巨大的努力
He had worked tremendously hard pre-season,

1073
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:34,900
所以我想，「天啊，這是一個大打擊啊」
o I was like, "man, this is a blow.

1074
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:37,370
我的意思是，這就像一腳，剛好踢在你的肚子上
I mean, this is a kick in the stomach right here."

1075
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:40,140
他們就像
They were like,

1076
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:41,640
「哦，我們祝你好運」
"oh, we wish you the best of luck."

1077
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:44,640
我說，「謝謝」
I was like, "thanks."

1078
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:50,150
{\i1}48小時後{\i}
{\i1}Within 48 hours,{\i}

1079
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:52,820
{\i1}他被休斯敦火箭隊接收{\i}
{\i1}He was picked up by the houston rockets.{\i}

1080
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:55,720
是的，我們一直在希望
Yeah, we were hoping

1081
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:57,250
沒有其他隊把他挑走
That no one else picked him up.

1082
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:59,290
我們對他感興趣，已經有很長一段時間了
We were interested in him for quite a long time.

1083
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:01,930
看過他在哈佛的比賽
Had been to his games at harvard.

1084
00:50:01,930 --> 00:50:04,630
那時候，我們就把他招進來，然後說
At the time, we just added him and said,

1085
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:08,300
「嘿，讓他加入看看會發生什麼」
"hey, let's bring him in and see what happens."

1086
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,770
我就去了休斯敦
I went to houston.

1087
00:50:11,770 --> 00:50:13,240
當時那裏有6個控衛
There were six point guards there.

1088
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:16,410
我甚至沒法參加訓練
I couldn't even get reps in practice.

1089
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:18,080
我不明白
I don't understand.

1090
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:20,010
我在金州勇士隊是個候補控衛
I was backup point guard at golden state,

1091
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:21,280
現在他們把我帶到這裏
And now they're gonna bring me here,

1092
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,710
然後我成了第六根弦（吉他聲音最低的那根弦）？
And I'm sixth string?

1093
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:24,820
林書豪在帶球
Jeremy lin on the drive.

1094
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:28,320
把球帶到籃筐，然後上籃
Take it to the rim, lays it up.

1095
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:31,390
在馬刺隊大個子球員面前的一個好球
Good shot with the spurs' bigs right in his face.

1096
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:33,190
當火箭隊接收了他
When the rockets picked him up,

1097
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:36,260
對於他來說，可能已經是跌入瓶底了
That was probably the bottom of the barrel for him.

1098
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:37,930
一個週日晚上，我們在聯誼會上
Sunday night, we were in fellowship,

1099
00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:43,400
我記得林書豪說，「嘿，我得走了」
And I remember Jeremy said, "hey, I gotta go.

1100
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,540
「我得趕飛機去休斯頓「
"I gotta catch my flight to Houston."

1101
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:47,270
他當時站在門口
He was standing at the door,

1102
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:52,210
他眼中含淚，因為……
And he had tears in his eyes, because, um...

1103
00:50:52,210 --> 00:50:54,010
因為壓力真的讓他難以承受
Because the pressure was really getting to him.

1104
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:57,050
他不知道他的未來裏還有什麼
He just didn't know what his future was gonna hold.

1105
00:50:57,050 --> 00:50:59,320
我記得他轉向我，然後說
And I remember he turned to me and he says,

1106
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:01,390
「我不知道我還能不能繼續撐下去」
"I don't know if I can keep doing this."

1107
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:05,490
{\i1}僅僅在火箭隊待了12天{\i}
After only 12 days with the rockets,

1108
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:07,630
{\i1}他再一次被裁{\i}
{\i1}He was cut again.{\i}

1109
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:09,960
{\i1}那天正好是聖誕節
It was christmas day.{\i}

1110
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:17,300
過去幾周顯然發生了很多事情
So obviously a lot has been happening the last couple of weeks.

1111
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:18,570
你心裏在想什麼？
What's going through your mind,

1112
00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:20,740
你今天感覺怎麼樣？
And how you feeling today?

1113
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:23,270
聖誕節早上，我被裁了
Christmas morning, I was waived.

1114
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,780
聖誕夜，我坐飛機回家
Flew back home on christmas night,

1115
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:29,550
兩周之內，我兩次被裁
And within two weeks, I had been waived twice

1116
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:34,320
而裁掉我的兩個隊說他們還需要我
By two teams who said they still wanted me.

1117
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,290
今天早上10點
10 a.M. This morning,

1118
00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:38,420
我得知紐約尼克斯隊選了我
Um, found out the knicks had picked me up.

1119
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:41,030
馬上我將第一次為尼克斯隊上場
And that's gonna be my first game with the knicks.

1120
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:43,130
在甲骨文球館（金州勇士隊主場，林書豪待的第一支NBA球隊）
It's gonna be at oracle arena.

1121
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:48,030
這場比賽明天晚上就要打了
You know, I'm literally going into this game tomorrow night,

1122
00:51:48,030 --> 00:51:50,470
而我還完全不知道隊友有哪些人
I have no idea who my teammates are.

1123
00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:52,240
我從未和他們一起打過球
I've never played with them one time.

1124
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,970
我完全不知道我們執行什麼戰術
I have no idea what plays we run.

1125
00:51:53,970 --> 00:51:55,970
球隊的一個戰術也不清楚
I don't know a single play,

1126
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:57,980
甚至還沒和教練講過話
And, you know, I haven't even talked to the coach yet,

1127
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:00,180
所以這下「好玩」了
So it's gonna be interesting.

1128
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:02,110
林書豪要上場了
I see jeremy lin coming in.

1129
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,380
他們（尼克斯）今天剛剛簽下他
They just signed him today.

1130
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:04,580


1131
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:06,980
只是在賽前的投籃練習稍微活動了一下
Went through a walk-through, at shoot-around today.

1132
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:09,920
林去年在金州勇士隊打過寥寥幾場比賽
Lin, who played with golden state last year sparingly,

1133
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,360
在發展聯盟也打過
Played in the d-league,

1134
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:13,060
歡呼很熱烈
Gets a nice ovation.

1135
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:14,760
這是我絕好的機會
It's a great opportunity for me

1136
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:16,030
只要能打上球
To be able to just play,

1137
00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:17,360
現在對我來說
And I think, for me right now,

1138
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,200
最重要的一件事
The one thing I really care about

1139
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:23,270
就是這樣一個打球的機會
Is just an opportunity to play.

1140
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:24,670
我將傾盡全力
I'm gonna give my best effort,

1141
00:52:24,670 --> 00:52:26,600
就算最終失敗
And, you know, if I go down,

1142
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:28,840
我也要用我的方式證明自己
I'm gonna make sure I go down doing it my way,

1143
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:31,140
同時，也是神的方式
Which is god's way.

1144
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:33,580
所以比賽前一晚
So it's the night before,

1145
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:35,410
我打包好了行李
And, you know, I gotta get my bags ready,

1146
00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:37,980
明天的比賽過後，我們將前往洛杉磯
And after the game tomorrow, we head to l.A.,

1147
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:40,820
再來是薩克拉門托，然後將飛去紐約，一直待在那裏
Sacramento, and then I'm off to new york for good.

1148
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:58,840
五場比賽過去了，我卻一分鐘都沒上
Five games go by, and I'm not playing at all.

1149
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:02,940
我覺得這一切都說不通
Nothing was really making sense to me.

1150
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:04,340
如果你簽了我
If you bring me in,

1151
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:06,240
卻連球隊訓練也不讓我打
And you don't let me play in practice,

1152
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:08,880
更不要說正式比賽了，那為什麼要我呢？
Let alone the games, then why am I here?

1153
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,880
我當時覺得，我可以幫助你們
I felt like, you know, I could help you,

1154
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:13,320
而只能眼睜睜地看著球隊輸球
And I was watching us lose.

1155
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:16,390
尼克斯隊已經四連敗了
The knicks have lost four straight games.

1156
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:18,360
連敗還在繼續
And the losing streak continues.

1157
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:21,190
尼克斯隊已經六連敗了
Knicks have now lost six in a row.

1158
00:53:21,190 --> 00:53:24,090
尼克斯隊的場上沒有很好的化學反應
There's a chemistry problem there on the floor.

1159
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:28,170
他們需要一個控衛來分配球
They need a point guard to distribute the ball.

1160
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:30,170
{\i1}林書豪最初的兩年合同{\i}
{\i1}Jeremy's original two-year contract{\i}

1161
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:31,700
{\i1}即將到期{\i}
{\i1}Was about to expire,{\i}

1162
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:33,700
{\i1}這意味著如果尼克斯隊裁掉他{\i}
{\i1}Which meant that, if the knicks let him go,{\i}

1163
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:37,340
{\i1}他不僅得不到薪水，而且，將永遠失去機會{\i1}
{\i1}He'd be dropped with no pay, and, this time, for good.{\i}

1164
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,110
在訓練時，書豪站在我旁邊
During practice, jeremy was standing right beside me

1165
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:43,800
{\pos(330,404)}麥克·德安東尼
尼克斯2008-2012主教練

1166
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:42,410
就站在場邊
On the side of the court

1167
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:45,480
但沒有加入訓練
And not really get in even in practice.

1168
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:49,950
我們把他簽下來只是
以防萬一哪天有人受傷時頂替的
He was just there in case one of these guys got hurt.

1169
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:52,020
我已經隱約有預感了
I pretty much saw the writing on the wall.

1170
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,990
當時就想，「差不多就是這樣了」
I was like, "I'm pretty much done,"

1171
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:55,730
我只能接受現實
And, like, I was resigned to the fact

1172
00:53:55,730 --> 00:53:57,630
我又要被裁了
That I was gonna get let go.

1173
00:53:57,630 --> 00:53:59,930
站在場邊的時候，他走向我
Standing on the side of the court, he comes up to me,

1174
00:53:59,930 --> 00:54:02,000
他說，「嘿，教練，我有一個問題。」
And he goes, "hey, coach, I've got a question."

1175
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,370
我就說，「書豪，什麼問題？」
I go, "what is it, jeremy?"

1176
00:54:03,370 --> 00:54:05,540
「我在這兒一直都是打出租車的」
"I'm taking a taxi everywhere.

1177
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:07,640
「我應該把我的車帶過來嗎？」
Should I ship my car out here?"

1178
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:13,210
當時他的反應是，「呃，也許不必」
And he was like, "uh, you know, probably not."

1179
00:54:13,210 --> 00:54:17,050
我當時就想，「完了，又要被裁了「
I was like, "oh, hell, I'm gonna get waived."

1180
00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:19,880
所以我就跟助教格蘭說
And so I went and talked to glen.

1181
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:21,420
我說，「格蘭，你怎麼看？」
I said, "glen, what do you think?"

1182
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:22,650
他說，「其實我們還沒有真正看過他打球」
And he goes, "well, we haven't really seen him.

1183
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:24,120
「我們不清楚」
We don't know."

1184
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:26,320
我說，「這樣吧，我們就讓他試試」
And I said, "you know what? Let me try to see

1185
00:54:26,330 --> 00:54:28,060
「如果週二之前讓他試著打幾場比賽」
"if we can get him in a couple games

1186
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:31,160
「看看會發生什麼」
Before Tuesday and just see what happens."

1187
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:35,100
他們對我說，「今晚你要上場」
They're like, "look, you're gonna play tonight.

1188
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:38,700
「上場之後」
"I want you to go out there.

1189
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:41,240
「不希望你做太多事情」
I don't want you to do too much."

1190
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:44,710
我說，「好的，我不會的」
I was like, "okay, I won't."

1191
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:49,450
加內特已經得了8分
8 points for garnett.

1192
00:54:49,450 --> 00:54:52,180
林書豪丟球，布拉德利斷球上籃得分
Lin coughs it up, bradley to the rim.

1193
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:53,850
我真的沒有做很多事
I didn't do too much.

1194
00:54:53,850 --> 00:54:56,190
我幾乎什麼都沒做，我的表現糟透了
I pretty much did nothing, and I played horrible.

1195
00:54:56,190 --> 00:54:57,820
投籃不中
You know, I missed shots,

1196
00:54:57,820 --> 00:54:59,690
又是失誤，又是犯規
I had turnovers, I had bad fouls.

1197
00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:00,720


1198
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:02,730
林書豪犯規
Lin reached in.

1199
00:55:02,730 --> 00:55:04,060
我想，我最多還有一次機會
I thought, at most,

1200
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:05,730
就是下一場比賽
I had one more chance the next game.

1201
00:55:05,730 --> 00:55:09,270
我當時想，我剛剛搞砸了和波士頓的比賽
I was like, "okay, I just screwed the boston game.

1202
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:12,100
「也許我要被裁了」
"I probably will get cut,

1203
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,670
「但他們明天可能會再給我一次機會」
But they may give me one more chance tomorrow."

1204
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:17,880
我記得那時
I think at the time,

1205
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:20,580
書豪其實住在他紐約的哥哥那
Jeremy was actually staying with his brother in new york,

1206
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:22,410
而在飛機上他跟我說
And he was talking to me on the plane.

1207
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:26,330
{\pos(807,398)}蘭德裏·菲爾茲
後衛，尼克斯2010-2012

1208
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:23,710
今晚會有一些朋友在我哥那過夜
He's like, "you know, my brother, he's got some people over,

1209
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:26,880
所以，我可不可以
"um, so, you know, is it cool

1210
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:29,250
在你家睡一晚上？
If I crash at your place instead?"

1211
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:31,990
我說，「當然可以」
You know, I was like, "yeah, sure, man, you can come."

1212
00:55:31,990 --> 00:55:33,720
不過我也有提醒他
I was giving him forewarning, though,

1213
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:35,090
我的沙發不太大
That my couch wasn't huge.

1214
00:55:35,090 --> 00:55:36,630
那個沙發是租來的
It was actually a rental couch at the time.

1215
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:39,660
差不多只有六英尺（183厘米）長
It might have been maybe six feet long.

1216
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:43,230
我們大概凌晨2點才到
We get in at, like, 2:00 in the morning.

1217
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,940
我去了菲爾茲家
I go over to landry's place.

1218
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:47,240
他給我看了他的沙發
He's like, "this is my couch,"

1219
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:48,870
大概這麼大
And his couch is like this big.

1220
00:55:48,870 --> 00:55:50,170
我當時就無語了
I'm like, "dude."

1221
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,040
我只能把頭掛在沙發一頭
I have my head hanging off of one end

1222
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,980
雙腳掛在另外一頭
And my legs hanging off the other.

1223
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:56,410
這樣怎麼能睡得好呢？
I'm like, "oh, my gosh, how am I gonna get a good night's rest?"

1224
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:57,820
明天還要打球
Like, "I might play tomorrow.

1225
00:55:57,820 --> 00:55:59,320
這也許是我最後的機會
This might be my last chance."

1226
00:56:01,390 --> 00:56:04,620
我記得當時對自己說
I remember thinking to myself,

1227
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:06,820
第一，我希望他能上場
One, I hope he gets in,

1228
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:09,590
因為他在波士頓的糟糕表現
Because he really didn't do enough in the boston game

1229
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:13,160
無法保證他有足夠的上場時間
To warrant getting big minutes.

1230
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:17,070
第二，如果他上場，他必須有好的表現
And, two, if he gets in, he's gotta play well,

1231
00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:19,470
不然這場比賽過後他們就會裁了他
Or they're gonna release him after the game.

1232
00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:21,970
有趣的是
It's funny.

1233
00:56:21,970 --> 00:56:25,860
本賽季是上次停擺後11、12年內
This season was the only season in the
last, like, 11, 12 years since the last lockout

1234
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:29,320
唯一有連著三場背靠背的賽季
where people have played back-to-back-to-back games.

1235
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:34,310
而尼克斯隊只有一次連著三場背靠背
And new york only had one stretch of back-to-back-to-back games.

1236
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,420
如果當時有更多休息時間
And if we had more days to rest,

1237
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:39,490
我不確定那場比賽我能否上場
I'm not sure if I would have been able to play in that game.

1238
00:56:42,290 --> 00:56:44,330
那天我禱告了
I prayed that day,

1239
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:47,430
我的禱告是
And my prayer is,

1240
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:52,070
「神啊，如果讓他打NBA是你的意願」
"god, if this is your will for him to play nba,

1241
00:56:52,070 --> 00:56:53,840
「那麼你需要展現給他看」
You need to show it."

1242
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:56,110


1243
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:02,850
莫羅再次得分
There's morrow. Morrow knocks it down.

1244
00:57:02,850 --> 00:57:04,750
德隆投籃
Williams sets himself,

1245
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:06,480
三分命中
Puts up the 3, and knocks that one down.

1246
00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:10,150
尼克斯隊已經落後10分了
The knicks find themselves down by 10 already.

1247
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:13,290
尼克斯隊的山姆波特，個人第二次犯規
New york foul is on shumpert, his second.

1248
00:57:13,290 --> 00:57:15,330
看看誰要上場了
Again, mike, look who's coming in.

1249
00:57:15,330 --> 00:57:18,900
是林書豪，你可以聽到球迷的大聲歡呼
Jeremy lin, and you hear a pretty big ovation.

1250
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:39,580
他看起來沒有猶豫
He didn't look tentative,

1251
00:57:39,590 --> 00:57:41,790
也沒有過於憂慮
He didn't look overly concerned.

1252
00:57:41,790 --> 00:57:44,290
他看起來就像在說，「我要放手一搏了」
He looked like, "dude, I'm about to go do it.

1253
00:57:44,290 --> 00:57:46,460
如果他們裁了我就裁吧
"if they cut me, they cut me.

1254
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:49,690
就算我再也不能在NBA打球也無所謂了
"if I don't never play another nba game, so be it.

1255
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:52,730
我要讓你們看看真正的林書豪是怎麼打球的
I'm going to play like jeremy lin can play."

1256
00:57:55,670 --> 00:57:57,870
林書豪突破上籃
Jeremy lin drives and finishes.

1257
00:57:57,870 --> 00:58:00,140
漂亮的上籃得分
Nice play from lin.

1258
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:01,670
丟球了
There's a strip of it.

1259
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:03,870
林書豪長傳給道格拉斯
Lin throws it ahead to toney douglas.

1260
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:06,340
擦板得分
Up for the layup! Banks it in!

1261
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:08,180
山姆波特殺過來了，傳球給林
Here comes shumpert to lin.

1262
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:10,750
林上籃，球進了
Lin flips it up and puts it in.

1263
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:13,420
又是林書豪！
Jeremy lin once again!

1264
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:16,690
他的半場數據差不多是10+4+4
He finished the half with like 10, 4, and 4,

1265
00:58:16,690 --> 00:58:19,160
對半場來說很不錯了
Like, good numbers for a half.

1266
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:22,590
超過了他之前所做的一切
That was such a higher high than, like, anything he's, like, done.

1267
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,960
我當時欣喜若狂
So I was, like, ecstatic at that point.

1268
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,970
而到了下半場，他簡直
The second half, he just went...

1269
00:58:27,970 --> 00:58:29,370
簡直瘋了
He just went nuts.

1270
00:58:29,370 --> 00:58:30,930
（林書豪）突到籃下了，球又進了
Driving to the basket, does it again.

1271
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:34,300
同時有加罰的機會
He's got a chance for a 3-point play as he got hit.

1272
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:36,740
（林書豪）撞到佩特洛，又殺向籃筐了
Bumped by petro, gets to the rim.

1273
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:38,440
進球有效，還造成對手犯規
Count it and a foul!

1274
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:40,510
林書豪！
Jeremy lin!

1275
00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:42,710
他經歷了美妙的一晚
He has in one special night

1276
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:43,780
成了（麥迪遜廣場）花園的寵兒
Become a garden favorite.

1277
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:45,950
今晚會被人記住嗎？
Will it be remembered?

1278
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:47,280
他連著做了
He was stringing together,

1279
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:48,750
三個胯下運球
Like, three crossover moves in a row.

1280
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:50,590
過去他從未這樣做過
Like, things he's never done before.

1281
00:58:50,590 --> 00:58:52,160
（林書豪）再次撕開防守
Splits the defense again!

1282
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:54,220
殺到籃下了！上籃命中！
Gets to the rim! Pops it in!

1283
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:56,290
還造成犯規！哇！
And a foul! Wow!

1284
00:58:58,330 --> 00:59:00,130
球迷已經都坐不住了
And the crowd on their feet

1285
00:59:00,130 --> 00:59:01,700
站起來向這個男人致敬
Paying homage to this man.

1286
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:03,470
看起來連他的隊友們
Clyde, even it looks like his teammates

1287
00:59:03,470 --> 00:59:05,500
也不相信所發生的一切
Don't believe what they're seeing.

1288
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:08,310
我當時太興奮了
I was just so emotional.

1289
00:59:08,310 --> 00:59:10,440
現在他們不能把我裁掉了
There's no way they can cut me now.

1290
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:13,540
我剛剛打了生命中最重要的比賽
I just had the game of my life.

1291
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:15,550
又是一個胯下運球後殺向籃筐
Again, the crossover, the basket.

1292
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:17,880
投籃，又進了
Puts it up, pops it in!

1293
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:21,950
林書豪，25分！
Jeremy lin with 25!

1294
00:59:21,950 --> 00:59:24,720
球迷們已經瘋狂了！
And this crowd is going crazy!

1295
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:27,020
盡情地突破，玩弄
Penetrating, manipulating,

1296
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:28,690
完全摧毀了籃網隊
Devastating the nets!

1297
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:31,060
他是來自哈佛的英雄
He's the hero from harvard,

1298
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:32,600
尼克斯隊終於
As the knicks

1299
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:35,700
拿到了一場亟需的勝利，這是他生命中最重要的比賽
Get a much-needed victory on the game of his life.

1300
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:38,970
他已經被興奮的隊友包圍
And he is swarmed by his ecstatic teammates

1301
00:59:38,970 --> 00:59:42,010
還有麥迪遜廣場花園興奮的球迷
And a jubilant crowd here at madison square garden.

1302
00:59:42,010 --> 00:59:43,710
感謝神
I'm just thankful to god

1303
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:45,380
賜予我這次上場的機會
For this opportunity to be able to come out here

1304
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:47,410
來為這支球隊打球
And play with this team and this organization.

1305
00:59:47,410 --> 00:59:49,880


1306
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:53,550
我洗了個澡
Man, I was taking a shower,

1307
00:59:53,550 --> 00:59:55,520
我甚至分不清
And I was like... I didn't even know.

1308
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:58,660
那是洗澡水
I was like, "is this water, like, from the shower,

1309
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:00,720
還是我流下的喜悅的淚水
Or am I actually crying, like, tears of joy?"

1310
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:04,630
我實在是太興奮了
Oh, I was just, like, so high on emotion.

1311
01:00:04,630 --> 01:00:07,230
我太開心了，我就坐在浴室裏
I was so happy. I was sitting in the shower,

1312
01:00:07,230 --> 01:00:09,430
腦子裏在回放發展聯盟裏的那些時光
Replaying all the times in the d-league,

1313
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,800
那些我不得不經歷的
All these flashbacks of these tough times

1314
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,100
艱苦歲月的片斷
I had to go through.

1315
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:14,640
我記得我出來後
And I remember I got out,

1316
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:18,910
看到我的家人，他們都在微笑
I saw my family, and they were all smiling.

1317
01:00:18,910 --> 01:00:20,210
我打電話給經紀人
I called my agent,

1318
01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:22,650
他在對我大喊大叫
And he was yelling at me on the phone, you know, like,

1319
01:00:22,650 --> 01:00:25,220
他說，「我太為你驕傲了！我就知道你行的」
"I'm so proud of you. I knew you could do it."

1320
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:29,390
這就是我希望取得的突破
That was kind of like the much-needed breakthrough that I was hoping for.

1321
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:33,690
在林書豪取得對籃網隊的驚艷表現之前
Before jeremy lin's first big game against new jersey,

1322
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:38,300
他根本不在尼克斯隊的計劃之內
He really wasn't in the knicks' plans at that point,

1323
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:39,860
據我所知
And I'm told they had begun

1324
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:43,830
他們當時已經考慮換掉他了
To look seriously at replacements.

1325
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:46,340
週六晚上的麥迪遜廣場花園
Clyde, Saturday night, madison square garden

1326
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:49,070
和整個賽季一樣人聲鼎沸
Sounded as loud as we've heard it all season.

1327
01:00:49,070 --> 01:00:50,740
他無與倫比
He was magnificent.

1328
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:53,040
從尼克斯隊的角度
You just hope from a knicks standpoint

1329
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:54,140
你會希望他能引領進攻
That he can run the offense

1330
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:56,080
保持週六那樣的精彩表現
As well as he ran it on Saturday.

1331
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:59,250
第一次首發我其實沒有特別緊張
I just really wasn't nervous for my first start.

1332
01:00:59,250 --> 01:01:01,450
通常來說，我應該會緊張
And, you know, usually, I would be,

1333
01:01:01,450 --> 01:01:04,790
但不知道為什麼我感覺很舒服
But I don't know why I just felt really comfortable,

1334
01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:06,690
超出自然的平靜
And it was just a supernatural peace,

1335
01:01:06,690 --> 01:01:09,260
這就是一些我無法解釋的事情
And it's one of those things that, you know, I can't really explain.

1336
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:14,130
{\i1}林書豪的第一次NBA首發出場{\i}
{\i1}For jeremy's first nba start,{\i}

1337
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:16,770
{\i1}阿瑪爾·斯塔德邁爾因個人原因缺陣{\i}
{\i1}Amar'e stoudemire was out for personal reasons,{\i}

1338
01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:19,940
{\i1}卡梅隆·安東尼上半場因傷下場{\i}
{\i1}And carmelo anthony suffered an injury in the first half.{\i}

1339
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:22,740
安東尼走路很艱難
Carmelo anthony comes up hobbling.

1340
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:24,110
他很難受
He's in a lot of discomfort.

1341
01:01:24,110 --> 01:01:25,980
他現在已經不能走路了
He can't move right now.

1342
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:28,410
{\i1}尼克斯隊現在需要一位領袖{\i}
{\i1}The knicks desperately needed a leader,{\i}

1343
01:01:28,410 --> 01:01:30,580
{\i1}而林書豪將承擔起這個使命{\i}
{\i1}And jeremy would answer the call.{\i}

1344
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:33,420
林書豪繞過傑弗森
Lin gets around jefferson,

1345
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:34,750
還在看人，上反籃得分
Looking, and backs it in.

1346
01:01:34,750 --> 01:01:37,020
上場比賽有不少這樣的表現
He had a couple of those the other night.

1347
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:38,560
我們不斷地打擋拆
We were running pick and roll

1348
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:39,860
一個擋拆接一個擋拆
After pick and roll after pick and roll.

1349
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:42,190
林書豪傳給裏面的傑弗裏斯
Lin inside to jeffries!

1350
01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:43,990
我不知道他能否保持對籃網那場的表現
I didn't know how he would follow up, that new jersey game,

1351
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,430
因為那場實在太棒了
'Cause it was such a high,

1352
01:01:46,430 --> 01:01:49,130
但是（本場比賽）他不斷上演各種誇張的上籃
But he just kept making ridiculous layups,

1353
01:01:49,130 --> 01:01:50,530
各種跳投命中
He was hitting jumpers.

1354
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:52,140
他們不瞭解我的打球習慣
They didn't know my tendencies,

1355
01:01:52,140 --> 01:01:53,870
他們不知道我的弱點
They didn't know my weak spots,

1356
01:01:53,870 --> 01:01:55,570
也不知道我的優勢和最佳投籃點
My strong spots, my sweet spots.

1357
01:01:55,570 --> 01:01:57,040
林書豪突進來了
Lin on the drive,

1358
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:58,540
拉桿，命中！
Flips it up, drops it in!

1359
01:01:58,540 --> 01:02:00,580
同時造成犯規！好一個反手上籃！
And a foul! Reverse layup!

1360
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:02,050
他們從未看過我打球
They had never seen me play.

1361
01:02:02,050 --> 01:02:04,920
向前推進，傳給山姆波特，又回傳給林書豪
Pushing it, ahead to shumpert, back to lin.

1362
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:08,950
林被打到了，球還是放進，2+1！
Lin gets hit, puts it in, and a foul!

1363
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:11,350
上籃
Lays it up, puts it up,

1364
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:12,620
還是活球
Chandler keeps it alive.

1365
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:14,390
林必須得投了
lin has to put it up.

1366
01:02:14,390 --> 01:02:18,460
在進攻24秒結束前三分命中
A 3-pointer as the shot clock expired!

1367
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:20,330
我像壓榨秘書似的使用他
I'm riding him like friggin' secretariat.

1368
01:02:23,070 --> 01:02:24,300
林書豪
Jeremy lin

1369
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:26,900
連續兩個職業生涯的重要夜晚
With his second consecutive career night.

1370
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:30,540
他現在是尼克斯隊新的首發控衛
He is the new starting point guard of the knicks.

1371
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:35,510
尼克斯隊再次取勝
And the knicks win again.

1372
01:02:35,510 --> 01:02:37,980
全場觀眾起立向林書豪致敬
A standing ovation for jeremy lin.

1373
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:47,860
過程中有非常多細微的因素
You know, there's so many little variables

1374
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:51,500
是我無法掌控的
With every step of the way being something I can't control.

1375
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:54,200
比如，休斯頓火箭隊晚了一天才裁掉我
You know, houston waives me a day late.

1376
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,830
如果他們早一天裁掉我
If they waive me a day earlier,

1377
01:02:55,830 --> 01:02:58,440
就會超過裁人的線
I would have been past the waiver wire.

1378
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:00,740
那天早上山姆波特正好受傷
Shumpert gets hurt that morning.

1379
01:03:00,740 --> 01:03:02,140
尼克斯隊才選了我
The knicks pick me up,

1380
01:03:02,140 --> 01:03:04,170
因為去年他們試訓過我
Because they had worked me out the year before.

1381
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:07,810
正好，尼克斯隊的主教練是德安東尼
You know, it happens to be d'antoni who's coaching here

1382
01:03:07,810 --> 01:03:09,810
他的進攻體系就像是為我量身打造的
Whose offense is tailor-made for me.

1383
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:11,950
突然之間，一切都變得瘋狂了
And all of a sudden, things just go crazy.

1384
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:15,890
過去兩場他平均得分26.5分
He's averaging 26 1/2 points a game the last two games.

1385
01:03:15,890 --> 01:03:17,550
我認為這不可持續
I don't think that's gonna continue.

1386
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,490
這顯然無法持續
Obviously, that's not gonna continue.

1387
01:03:20,690 --> 01:03:22,760
接著我們踏上客場之旅，前往華盛頓
Then we hit the road and go to washington,

1388
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:25,100
又將遇上約翰·沃爾
And it's like john wall again, you know.

1389
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:27,700
夏季聯賽的時候我和沃爾交過手
Like, I played against john wall in the summer league,

1390
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:30,230
現在狹路相逢
And now it's, like, a rematch.

1391
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,570
又要和他對位
Now I'm playing against him again.

1392
01:03:32,570 --> 01:03:35,140
嗚~
Ooh!

1393
01:03:36,670 --> 01:03:38,640
林書豪突破到禁區內
Lin on the drive, gets inside.

1394
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:42,180
林書豪反手上籃，漂亮！
Reverse layup. Great play by jeremy lin.

1395
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:43,650
沃爾殺過來了，看著
Here comes wall. Look at wall.

1396
01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:44,850
撕開防守
Breaks the press,

1397
01:03:44,850 --> 01:03:47,280
左手暴扣
And throws it down with the left hand!

1398
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:51,050
我當時的反應是，靠，他居然在我頭上扣籃
I was like, "dang, he kinda dunked on my head."

1399
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:53,890
我必須還以顏色！
I was like, "I'm gonna try to get him back."

1400
01:03:53,890 --> 01:03:56,560
幾個回合過後，他們的防守出了問題
Couple possessions later, they messed up their coverage,

1401
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:57,990
我輕鬆地突進去
I had a free lane,

1402
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,730
就試著去扣扣籃
And I just tried to take the rim down.

1403
01:03:59,730 --> 01:04:02,030
林書豪突破！
Lin drives!

1404
01:04:02,030 --> 01:04:03,830
這才是你說的扣籃
There's the dunk you're talking about, clyde.

1405
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,640
林書豪點燃球迷的激情
Jeremy lin fires up the crowd.

1406
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:08,100
我看到這麼大的空當
When I saw that opening,

1407
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:11,880
我只是用盡全力去完成那記扣籃
I just tried to dunk it as hard as I could.

1408
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:14,850
我不知道
I don't know. There's just...

1409
01:04:14,850 --> 01:04:19,380
只是有太多的痛苦和磨煉
There's been so much pain and so many trying times,

1410
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:20,780
現在終於能打上球了
And now that I get to play,

1411
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:22,650
我只是想把這些都宣洩出來
I'm just letting it all out, man.

1412
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:24,550
把一切都宣洩在球場上
I'm just letting it all out on the floor.

1413
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:27,660
比賽過後，當我回想時
After the game, I just look back,

1414
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:30,490
覺得很有趣
And I'm like, "man, that was so fun."

1415
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:31,600
一個美妙的故事正在醞釀，主角是林書豪
The great story that's brewing is jeremy lin,

1416
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:32,930


1417
01:04:32,930 --> 01:04:34,800
他本年度的合同算是有保證了
And this week, contracts are guaranteed for the rest of the year.

1418
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:35,970


1419
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:39,000
他的球場表現就像在說，「讓他的價值充分展現」
（電影《甜心先生》的台詞）
He's been balling out, saying, "show that man his money."

1420
01:04:39,070 --> 01:04:39,170


1421
01:04:39,170 --> 01:04:41,340
有一點可以肯定，他在場上的視野很好
The things that's for real is his vision,

1422
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:42,570
這不會變
Which won't change,

1423
01:04:42,570 --> 01:04:44,070
他的速度不會變
His speed, which won't change,

1424
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:46,480
他對比賽的認知不會變
His knowledge of the game, which won't change.

1425
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:47,980
我就是覺得不會變
I just don't see it changing.

1426
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:50,010
請不要再引用我的話了
Now, again, please don't quote me on that one.

1427
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:51,380
肯尼·史密斯：現在他該出現在球探報告裏了
Kenny Smith: Now he's on the scouting report.

1428
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:53,020
沙奎爾·奧尼爾： 是的，當然
Shaquille o'neal: Yeah, he is now.

1429
01:04:53,020 --> 01:04:54,650
我們來看看他是否在洛杉磯湖人隊的球探報告裏
Let's see if he's in the scouting report for the lakers

1430
01:04:54,650 --> 01:04:57,750
沒錯，週五晚上，關注麥迪遜廣場花園
Oh, yeah, he is. On Friday night at the garden.

1431
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:04,560
過去兩周我就是睡這裏的
This is basically where I lived the last two weeks

1432
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:07,560
睡在這張沙發上
And so it's the couch I slept on.

1433
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:10,470
我的哥哥和大嫂
Uh, my brother and sister-in-law,

1434
01:05:10,470 --> 01:05:14,300
好好地招待了我
Uh, did a good job of hosting me.

1435
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:15,370
很開心
Had a lot of fun.

1436
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:16,810


1437
01:05:16,810 --> 01:05:19,710
現在他們的小弟弟就要搬出去了
And now their little kid might have to move out.

1438
01:05:19,710 --> 01:05:20,940


1439
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:22,810
如果我現在不洗衣服
If I don't do laundry now,

1440
01:05:22,810 --> 01:05:24,850
那我結婚了也不會洗，沒錯
I won't do laundry when I'm married. Fact.

1441
01:05:24,850 --> 01:05:26,580
大嫂：你們髒死了
Sister-in-law:You guys are brats.

1442
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:28,020
我們會做別的事情
So? We do other things.

1443
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:29,420


1444
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:30,950
大嫂：比如？
Sister-in-law: Like what?

1445
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:31,990


1446
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:33,760
什麼比如不比如的
What do you mean, like what?

1447
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:36,690
你應該問有什麼是我們不做的
Like, what don't we do, is the question.

1448
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:37,860
大嫂：那你會做什麼？
Sister-in-law: What do you do?

1449
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:39,430
媽媽： {\i1}你 {\i}會做什麼？
Shirley: What do {\i1}you{\i} do?

1450
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:40,630
我每天都午睡
I take a nap every day.

1451
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:41,900
媽媽：是的，這個我瞭解
Shirley: Yeah, that I know.

1452
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:43,770
沒有很多人能做到這個
Who does that? Not many people can.

1453
01:05:43,770 --> 01:05:45,340
沒有很多人可以
Not many people can.

1454
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:46,470
你還是個吃貨
And you eat a lot,

1455
01:05:46,470 --> 01:05:49,140
一天到晚吃個不停
Nonstop all day long. Yeah.

1456
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:51,010
昨天，總經理跟我說
Yesterday, the general manager was like,

1457
01:05:51,010 --> 01:05:53,740
書豪，你的合同有保障了
"hey, jeremy, by the way, you're guaranteed now,

1458
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:55,680
不要睡沙發了
So get off the couch."

1459
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:58,850
我......
I was like...

1460
01:05:58,850 --> 01:06:01,080
媽媽：他其實有地方住
Shirley: This guy has a place to stay,

1461
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:03,290
但是他不想住那
But he doesn't want to stay there.

1462
01:06:03,290 --> 01:06:04,790
只想賴在這裏
He want to crash in here.

1463
01:06:04,790 --> 01:06:06,590
他們可不想這個上新聞
They don't want this to be on the news,

1464
01:06:06,590 --> 01:06:09,130
林書豪睡在他哥哥的沙發上
Jeremy sleeping on the couch at his brother's.

1465
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:10,790
為什麼？
Why?

1466
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,300
這太瘋狂了
It's crazy.

1467
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:14,160
太瘋狂了
It's just crazy to...

1468
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:16,630
告訴你吧，我的社交網絡，我的手機
I'm telling you, social media, Twitter, facebook, my phone, it's just...

1469
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:19,000


1470
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:22,970
我不知道還能不能更瘋狂
I don't know if it could get crazier than this.

1471
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:25,740
我真的不知道
Like, I really don't.

1472
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:26,880
林書豪？
Jeremy lin?

1473
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:28,040
有聽說過嗎？
Are you following that story at all?

1474
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:30,050
不知道，聽過一下
No idea. I know who he is,

1475
01:06:30,050 --> 01:06:31,450
但我真的不太清楚狀況
But I don't really know what's going on too much with that.

1476
01:06:31,450 --> 01:06:32,850
你對林書豪過去一周的表現感到震驚嗎？
Are you surprised at the production that lin's had over the past week?

1477
01:06:32,850 --> 01:06:34,150


1478
01:06:34,150 --> 01:06:35,990
我還不知道他做過什麼
I don't even know what he's done.

1479
01:06:35,990 --> 01:06:40,120
根本就不知道你們說的是哪個人
Like, I have no idea which you guys are talking about.

1480
01:06:40,130 --> 01:06:42,130


1481
01:06:42,130 --> 01:06:44,260
我看了一些報道
I'm reading all these quotes

1482
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:45,830
關於他（科比）說了什麼
About what he's saying.

1483
01:06:45,830 --> 01:06:48,400
「科比完全不知道林書豪是何人」
"kobe bryant has no idea who jeremy lin is."

1484
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:49,970
我的反應是，「什麼」？
I'm like, "what?"

1485
01:06:51,870 --> 01:06:53,270
我在想，「你為什麼要這麼說」
I'm like, "why would you do that?

1486
01:06:53,270 --> 01:06:54,670
「我完全沒有談論你」
"I didn't say anything about you.

1487
01:06:54,670 --> 01:06:57,610
「從沒說過你的壞話」
I never talked bad about you."

1488
01:06:57,610 --> 01:06:59,540
所以聽說這件事時，我心想……
So when I heard that, I was like...

1489
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:00,710


1490
01:07:00,710 --> 01:07:01,950
「球場上見」
"here we go."

1491
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:06,150
你會單防他嗎？
Would you consider guarding him

1492
01:07:06,150 --> 01:07:08,180
如果他的表現很好？
If he's having one of those games?

1493
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:09,320


1494
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:11,420
你們不要著急
Let's not get ahead of ourselves here.

1495
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:15,730
加油！
Let's go!

1496
01:07:15,730 --> 01:07:17,290
新的英雄已經出現
There is a new man in town.

1497
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:19,430
狹路相逢勇者勝
"may the best man lin(win)."

1498
01:07:19,430 --> 01:07:23,230
今晚的競猜，林書豪能否超過23分
Over-under, 23 points for lin tonight, bomani.

1499
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:25,740
對手是內線長人如林的湖人隊
Against the lakers with those trees they've got inside?

1500
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:27,900
今晚不會有那麼多林瘋狂時刻了
It won't be so linsane tonight.

1501
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:30,970
今晚誰得分高？科比還是林書豪？
Kobe or lin? Who scores more tonight?

1502
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:33,680
我選林書豪，我的英雄
I'm going with my guy, jeremy lin, my hero.

1503
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:34,910


1504
01:07:34,910 --> 01:07:37,180
因為他無所不「林」
Because all he does is lin, baby!

1505
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:39,820
短短一周
Jeremy lin in just one week

1506
01:07:39,820 --> 01:07:41,250
林書豪就改變了一切
Has turned things around

1507
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:43,650
無論對他自己還是尼克斯隊來說
For his career and for the new york knicks.

1508
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:46,260
我愛林書豪，太棒了！
I love it! It's awesome, man!

1509
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:48,690
這是紐約發生過最美妙的事情
This is like the greatest thing that's happened to new york ever.

1510
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:49,860
就是這麼一個夜晚
It's one of those nights,

1511
01:07:49,860 --> 01:07:51,090
一個故事
And it's one of those stories

1512
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:54,030
讓我們知道為何如此熱愛體育
Where it really is why we love sports.

1513
01:07:54,030 --> 01:07:56,270
我不知道結果會怎樣
I didn't know how it was gonna turn out,

1514
01:07:56,270 --> 01:07:57,600
但是
But I was like,

1515
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:59,300
我將非常非常具有攻擊性
"I'm just gonna be really, really aggressive."

1516
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:09,510
我們的比賽進行得很順利，投籃都彈無虛發
Everything was going well, everything was going down.

1517
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:16,020
林書豪跳投，命中！
Lin puts it up, puts it in!

1518
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:18,890
完美的開局
Terrific start!

1519
01:08:18,890 --> 01:08:21,860
聽聽球迷的歡呼吧！
And listen to this garden crowd.

1520
01:08:21,860 --> 01:08:25,530
我記最讓我激動不已的是
I think the one thing where I kind of lost it a little bit,

1521
01:08:25,530 --> 01:08:26,660


1522
01:08:26,670 --> 01:08:28,800
看著他帶球，突然急停轉身
He'd come down, he kind of like stutter-stepped, and spun

1523
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:31,600
手指很柔軟地輕輕一投
And finger-rolled it.

1524
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:32,940
林喜歡這個大空當
Lin likes the open floor.

1525
01:08:32,940 --> 01:08:34,640
轉身，投籃，命中！
Spinning, puts it up and puts it in!

1526
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:37,940
林書豪，超級精彩的得分
Sensational play for jeremy lin!

1527
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:41,440
整個球館都沸騰了，在這樣一個全國矚目的舞台
The garden erupted, and to do it on the national stage,

1528
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:45,380
任何人看過之後都永生難忘
Anybody who saw that moment will never forget.

1529
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:48,280
又一次點燃了麥迪遜廣場花園
Electrifying the garden again!

1530
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:50,050
他已經得了18分了
He's got 18 points.

1531
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:55,830
歡迎來到演播室，這是林書豪的半場個人表演
Welcome to our studios for the jeremy lin toyota halftime show.

1532
01:08:55,830 --> 01:08:57,930
林書豪是頂級的
Jeremy lin was superb,

1533
01:08:57,930 --> 01:08:59,660
投籃12中7

1534
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:01,300
拿下18分5次助攻
18 points, 5 assists.

1535
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:03,700
科比和他的隊友的投籃手感還很差
Kobe bryant and the lakers struggling shooting the ball,

1536
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:05,500
但現在他們還只落後8分
But they're only down by 8.

1537
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:07,300
科比，一系列假動作
Bryant, a couple of fakes,

1538
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:10,770
要投籃了，球進了
Gonna put it up, and knocks it down.

1539
01:09:10,780 --> 01:09:13,180
林書豪搶斷
Stripped by lin, stolen by lin.

1540
01:09:13,180 --> 01:09:16,910
助攻左側的山姆波特，左手上籃命中！
Left side, shumpert, left-handed layup!

1541
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:20,680
科比轉身，高難度的一球
Bryant spinning, difficult shot.

1542
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:22,290


1543
01:09:22,290 --> 01:09:24,390
又是科比
Kobe bryant again.

1544
01:09:24,390 --> 01:09:27,460
他要開始接管比賽了
He is starting to get in one of those zones right now.

1545
01:09:29,890 --> 01:09:32,360
加索爾在防守林書豪
Gasol is on lin.

1546
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:34,930
一個兩分球，進了！
Puts up the 2-pointer. Puts it in!

1547
01:09:34,930 --> 01:09:37,330
林書豪31分！
Jeremy lin with 31!

1548
01:09:39,770 --> 01:09:41,440
傑弗裏斯搶下籃板
And the rebound by jeffries.

1549
01:09:42,870 --> 01:09:44,570
林書豪三分
Lin for 3.

1550
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:45,610
梆！
Bang!

1551
01:09:45,610 --> 01:09:48,010
三分命中
3-pointer!

1552
01:09:48,010 --> 01:09:52,220
林書豪！
Jeremy lin!

1553
01:09:52,220 --> 01:09:54,980
我整年最喜歡的一次得分
And my favorite play of this whole year

1554
01:09:54,990 --> 01:09:56,990
就是那個底腳的三分
Was when I hit that 3 in the corner

1555
01:09:56,990 --> 01:09:59,960
因為那場比賽有太多的渲染
Just because that game had so much hype,

1556
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:03,290
那記投籃就像一把匕首
And that shot was kind of the dagger

1557
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:05,860
狠狠地給了他們一刀
That put the game out of reach for them.

1558
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:08,100
本賽季兩次被裁
Already cut twice this season,

1559
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:11,060
因為無處可去而只能睡在隊友的沙發上
Sleeping on a teammate's couch, because he had nowhere else to go,

1560
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:14,740
而一夜之間，他成了曼哈頓的寵兒
And, suddenly, jeremy lin is the toast of manhattan.

1561
01:10:14,740 --> 01:10:16,040
就在這裏
This is it right here.

1562
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:17,210
這就是我的夢想
This is my dream, and, uh,

1563
01:10:17,210 --> 01:10:19,010
我感謝神
I'm just thankful to god, man,

1564
01:10:19,010 --> 01:10:21,580
讓我美夢成真
Because this is my dream being lived out,

1565
01:10:21,580 --> 01:10:23,250
我無比感恩
And I'm so thankful for that.

1566
01:10:23,250 --> 01:10:25,880
林書豪38分
Jeremy lin, 38 points.

1567
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:28,650
本賽季尼克斯隊球員的得分新高
It's the most by a knick this season.

1568
01:10:28,650 --> 01:10:33,020
「林瘋狂」還在麥迪遜廣場花園繼續
Linsanity continues here in madison square garden.

1569
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:34,360
這真的難以形容
It's indescribable, really.

1570
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:36,560
我從未見過這樣的事情
It's something I've never seen before.

1571
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:37,760
我沒有預料到
I didn't foresee this coming.

1572
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:40,360
難以置信
You know, it's unbelievable.

1573
01:10:40,370 --> 01:10:42,570
我這人會很奇怪
This is, like, how weird I am.

1574
01:10:42,570 --> 01:10:44,630
我當時想這場比賽之後我要出口氣
I was like, "I'm gonna go off this game,"

1575
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:47,540
採訪結束時，他們肯定會問我
And at the end of the interview, they're gonna be like,

1576
01:10:47,540 --> 01:10:49,410
你覺得科比現在認識你了嗎？
"oh, so do you think kobe knows who you are now?"

1577
01:10:49,410 --> 01:10:51,980
書豪，你知道肯定有個人會問你這個問題
Jeremy, you knew somebody was gonna ask you this,

1578
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:54,110
你認為科比現在認識你了嗎？
But do you think kobe knows who you are now?

1579
01:10:54,110 --> 01:10:55,580
如果他們問我那個問題
If they ask me that question,

1580
01:10:55,580 --> 01:10:57,350
我的回答會是，「科比？誰啊？」
I'm gonna be like, "who the hell is kobe?"

1581
01:10:57,350 --> 01:10:58,920
我本想這樣回答
That's what I was gonna say.

1582
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:01,550
但我想了一會兒
And then I, like, thought about it,

1583
01:11:01,550 --> 01:11:03,020
禱告的時候
And I prayed about it,

1584
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:04,620
想想神會怎麼做呢？
I was like, you know, "what would jesus do?"

1585
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:06,760
不，神應該不會這麼說
And I'm like, "jesus probably wouldn't say that,"

1586
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:09,630
所以我要改變我的答案
So I was like, "I'm gonna change my answer."

1587
01:11:09,630 --> 01:11:13,000
「這得問科比本人了」
Aw, well, you guys have to ask kobe.

1588
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,630
我不知道
I don't know.

1589
01:11:14,630 --> 01:11:18,000
讓我們來看看當今體育界最大的新聞：林書豪
Let's get to what matters in sports today, jeremy lin.

1590
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,570
林書豪現在是紐約的第一巨星
Right now, the biggest star in new york is jeremy lin.

1591
01:11:20,570 --> 01:11:22,040
就算你不關注體育也一定聽過他的故事
I don't even think you have to
be a sports fan to hear about this story.

1592
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:23,240


1593
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:26,210
「林旋風」橫掃紐約全城
New york has a raging case of linsanity.

1594
01:11:26,210 --> 01:11:29,610
現在是瘋狂的時刻
That's what it is right now. It's madness right now.

1595
01:11:29,610 --> 01:11:30,610
林書豪
Jeremy lin!

1596
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:32,120
無所不「林」
All I do is lin, lin, lin.

1597
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:35,550
你覺得怎麼樣？
What do you think?

1598
01:11:35,550 --> 01:11:37,020
你覺得現在的一切如何？
What do you think about all this?

1599
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:39,290
瘋狂，太瘋狂了
Um, it's crazy. It's just crazy.

1600
01:11:39,290 --> 01:11:40,920
現在體育界最大的頭條
One of the biggest headlines

1601
01:11:40,930 --> 01:11:43,330
就是「林瘋狂」
In sports right now is linsanity.

1602
01:11:43,330 --> 01:11:45,160
你還沒聽說過他？你會的
If you haven't caught it yet, you will.

1603
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:48,200
「林瘋狂」席捲紐約城
Linsanity takes new york by storm.

1604
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:50,270
他實在是尼克斯隊沒有辦法的辦法了
He was a last-ditch effort for the knicks.

1605
01:11:50,270 --> 01:11:52,300
當時的情況可能是，有人說，「今晚誰想上場嗎？」
They sort of said, "all right, who wants to play?"

1606
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:54,770
他舉起了手，然後就有人說，「那好，你上吧」
And he raised his hand and, "all right, get in there."

1607
01:11:54,770 --> 01:11:57,040
我這麼多年報道體育以來前所未聞的事情
I have never seen anything like this in all my years of covering sports.

1608
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:59,580


1609
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:01,640
從為見過一個人從默默無聞
I've never seen somebody go from a no-name

1610
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:03,980
在兩周之內成為一個轟動的現象
To an absolute phenomenon inside of two weeks.

1611
01:12:03,980 --> 01:12:05,550
太難以置信了
It's unbelievable.

1612
01:12:05,550 --> 01:12:09,620
他有魅力、有型、有天賦
He's doing it with charisma, with style, with flair,

1613
01:12:09,620 --> 01:12:12,260
而且，他還打得很開心
And he's having fun.

1614
01:12:12,260 --> 01:12:13,920
這很瘋狂，火得不行
It's crazy. It's catching fire.

1615
01:12:13,930 --> 01:12:16,130
我覺得「林瘋狂」這個詞
Linsanity, I think it'll probably be

1616
01:12:16,130 --> 01:12:18,030
將會收錄到下一版的字典裏
In the dictionary in the next version.

1617
01:12:18,030 --> 01:12:19,760
林瘋狂？我愛林瘋狂
Linsanity? I love it.

1618
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:22,070
我愛林瘋狂，我為他感到高興
I love linsanity. I'm so happy for him.

1619
01:12:22,070 --> 01:12:23,630
林書豪（過去三場）得了89分
Jeremy lin's 89 points,

1620
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:28,400
這是所有球員自NBA和ABA合併以來
職業生涯前三場首發合計最高分
The most by any player in his first
three pro starts since the aba-nba merger.

1621
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:31,040
傳給外面的林，林面對裏德諾胯下運球
Outside to lin, crosses over ridnour,

1622
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:32,180
投籃命中
And hits.

1623
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:34,480
林書豪空中連線菲爾茲
Jeremy lin up top to fields.

1624
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:37,250
林迅速殺到籃下
Lin a whirling dervish right to the rim,

1625
01:12:37,250 --> 01:12:39,120
左右騰挪完成上籃
Zigzagging to the cup.

1626
01:12:40,250 --> 01:12:42,350
尼克斯隊又取得一場勝利
The knicks have stolen one.

1627
01:12:42,350 --> 01:12:47,160
賽季最長的五連勝
It's their fifth straight win, their longest of the season.

1628
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:49,060
您已經不是哈佛最有名的畢業生了
You have been surpassed as the most
famous person who is a harvard graduate.

1629
01:12:49,060 --> 01:12:50,560


1630
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:52,530
我其實比你們更早知道林書豪
I knew about jeremy before you did.

1631
01:12:52,530 --> 01:12:54,160
您的意思是「林瘋狂」也有您的功勞？
Are you taking credit for linsanity?

1632
01:12:54,170 --> 01:12:55,330
我覺得您有點這個意思
It kind of feels like you are a little bit.

1633
01:12:55,330 --> 01:12:56,600
我並沒有功勞
I can't take credit for it,

1634
01:12:56,600 --> 01:13:00,700
我的意思只是，我比你們更早認識了他
But I'm just saying I was there early.

1635
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:04,140
如你所說，這是很棒的故事
As you said, it's a great story.

1636
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:07,410
對你來說，哪一部分最棒？
What's the greatest part in it for you?

1637
01:13:07,410 --> 01:13:08,810
我們取得五連勝
That we've won five in a row.

1638
01:13:08,810 --> 01:13:10,050


1639
01:13:10,050 --> 01:13:11,350
對我個人來說是這樣
That's it for me.

1640
01:13:11,350 --> 01:13:13,520
所有的一切
Uh, just everything,

1641
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:16,390
這就是體育的魅力
Just here's just what's right with sports.

1642
01:13:16,390 --> 01:13:18,690
從默默無聞到一舉成名
He's an underdog that came up.

1643
01:13:18,690 --> 01:13:19,960
他很好地做到了
He does it the right way.

1644
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:21,890
他夠格打NBA嗎？當然，毫無疑問
Can he play in the nba? Yeah, of course.

1645
01:13:21,890 --> 01:13:24,260
他全面，打得也很好
He's got all the tools, and he's playing really well.

1646
01:13:24,260 --> 01:13:26,700
那不是僥倖，他有實力
That's not a fluke, how he's playing.

1647
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:30,500
當時場邊有個人
I had this one dude courtside

1648
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:32,440
整場比賽都在對我大吼大叫
Who was just yelling at me the whole game.

1649
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:34,370
「你只能持續一周罷了」
He's like, "you're a one-week wonder."

1650
01:13:34,370 --> 01:13:37,340
「這場比賽你就會輸了，你遜斃了」
You know, "you're not gonna win this game. You suck."

1651
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:40,840
我們那場打得很糟糕
We were playing bad.

1652
01:13:40,850 --> 01:13:42,350
全隊都很疲憊
We were tired, and I was like,

1653
01:13:42,350 --> 01:13:45,280
「這將是一場艱難的比賽」
"man, this is gonna be a tough one to pull out."

1654
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:47,820
比賽剩一分鐘時我們還落後五分
We were down 5 with a minute left.

1655
01:13:47,820 --> 01:13:49,920
那是一次關鍵的搶斷
You know, we got this huge steal,

1656
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:51,790
扣籃，還落後三分
Layup, down 3.

1657
01:13:53,190 --> 01:13:56,190
他們進攻沒打成，我們有喘息的機會
They're coming down, we get a stop.

1658
01:13:56,190 --> 01:13:58,200
阿米爾·約翰遜那個加罰球
The and-1 at amir johnson

1659
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:01,260
拉平了比分，他個人已有5個蓋帽
who I believe had 5 blocks to that point, ties the game.

1660
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:03,100
林書豪假投三分，改為突破
Lin fakes the 3, drives,

1661
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:04,230
突進去上籃了
Goes in for the layup,

1662
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:06,170
球進了，還造成犯規！
It's good, and a foul!

1663
01:14:06,170 --> 01:14:10,070
林書豪有機會通過罰球扳平比分
Lin can tie it with a free throw.

1664
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:11,670
當時球沒進
They come down, missed shot,

1665
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:14,410
我們拿到球，比賽差不多還有20秒
And now we got the ball with, like, 20 seconds left.

1666
01:14:14,410 --> 01:14:15,910
林傳給山姆波特
Lin to shumpert,

1667
01:14:15,910 --> 01:14:17,550
山姆波特跳投
Shumpert, pull-up jump shot.

1668
01:14:17,550 --> 01:14:19,550
沒進，錢德勒搶到籃板
Won't go, Chandler the rebound.

1669
01:14:19,550 --> 01:14:22,020
尼克斯隊將耗盡時間，完成最後一投
And the knicks will hold it for the final shot

1670
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:24,890
24秒進攻倒計時已經關閉
As the 24-second clock is shut off.

1671
01:14:26,460 --> 01:14:29,060
德安東尼沒有叫暫停
Mike d'antoni won't call time out

1672
01:14:29,060 --> 01:14:31,190
猛龍隊做好了防守準備
And let the raptors set up their d.

1673
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:34,560
加拿大航空中心的觀眾都站起來了
The crowd on its feet here at the air canada centre.

1674
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,470
林書豪跳投
Lin puts it up.

1675
01:14:38,470 --> 01:14:40,070
梆！！
Bang!

1676
01:14:40,070 --> 01:14:42,410
林書豪，三分命中！
Jeremy lin from downtown,

1677
01:14:42,410 --> 01:14:43,910
尼克斯隊取得領先！
And the knicks take the lead!

1678
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:50,280
太驚人了！
Amazing here at the air canada centre!

1679
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:52,880
只剩10秒鐘，所有人都站起來了
10 seconds, everyone standing,

1680
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:54,480
全場有2萬人
20,000 in toronto.

1681
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:56,250
拉開拉開！
Get out of his way!

1682
01:14:56,250 --> 01:14:59,360
讓他單挑卡爾德隆！
Let him just take calderon himself!

1683
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:01,190
還剩3秒鐘，林書豪有身高優勢
Three seconds, lin sizes him up,

1684
01:15:01,190 --> 01:15:03,660
干拔三分命中！
Straightaway 3, buries it!

1685
01:15:03,660 --> 01:15:05,330
只留下0.5秒鐘
.5 remaining!

1686
01:15:05,330 --> 01:15:07,600
「林瘋狂」還在繼續！
Linsanity continues!

1687
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:09,230
我對結果很滿意
I'm just glad it went like this,

1688
01:15:09,230 --> 01:15:11,600
讓林瘋狂能夠稍微冷卻一點
So we can calm the linsanity down a little bit.

1689
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:13,340


1690
01:15:13,340 --> 01:15:14,240
我們無法阻擋
Where we couldn't get a stop...

1691
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:15,840


1692
01:15:19,580 --> 01:15:21,740
我夢寐以求的，就是投進這樣的制勝球
That's all I dream about is hitting the game winner

1693
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:24,280
再擺出搞怪的動作
And then doing some cool little dorky pose

1694
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:25,820
然後帥氣地走回去
And then walking off.

1695
01:15:25,820 --> 01:15:29,090
像我小時候那樣
You know, that's, like, all I did growing up.

1696
01:15:29,090 --> 01:15:30,320
我一直想這麼做
I always wanted to do that.

1697
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:31,790
想知道那是什麼感覺
I wanted to know what that felt like.

1698
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:35,120
他有能力
He's got the game,

1699
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:38,030
他態度很好，他很拉風
He's got the attitude, he's got the swag.

1700
01:15:38,030 --> 01:15:39,060
他什麼都有
He's got all of that.

1701
01:15:39,060 --> 01:15:40,160


1702
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:41,630
謝謝你們
Okay. "thank you for being..."

1703
01:15:41,630 --> 01:15:43,170
或者我直接開始第一部分？
Or do I just do the first part?

1704
01:15:43,170 --> 01:15:44,270
可以
Yeah. Okay.

1705
01:15:44,270 --> 01:15:48,440
嘿，書豪，呃，我是說.......
"hey, jeremy..."I mean...Whoops.

1706
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:52,440
{\i1}it's driving me out of my mind{\i}
{\i1}（Bell Biv Devoe《Poison》的歌詞）{\i}

1707
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:53,680
只要撥打電話
"just dial star-star-knicks on your iphone or android phone..."

1708
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:56,250


1709
01:15:56,250 --> 01:15:58,110
或登錄尼克斯隊官網
Or go to nyknicks.

1710
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:01,820
{\i1}can't get it outta my head{\i}

1711
01:16:01,820 --> 01:16:03,050
{\i1}head{\i}

1712
01:16:03,050 --> 01:16:06,020
{\i1}that girl is poison{\i}

1713
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:07,490


1714
01:16:07,490 --> 01:16:08,390
天啊
Oh, man.

1715
01:16:08,390 --> 01:16:09,560
完美
Perfect.

1716
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:11,260
所有印度尼西亞的朋友
"to all my friends in indonesia..."

1717
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:13,160
所有新加坡的球迷
"to all my fans in singapore..."

1718
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:14,700
全世界的球迷
"to all my fans around the world,

1719
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:16,670
謝謝你們的支持
Thank you for all your support."

1720
01:16:16,670 --> 01:16:18,770


1721
01:16:18,770 --> 01:16:22,860
林瘋狂的魅力甚至繞過半個地球到了台灣
Linsanity is catching on even halfway around the world in taiwan,

1722
01:16:23,270 --> 01:16:25,940
點燃了台灣球迷的激情
Even halfway around the world in taiwan,Igniting a crowd in taipei that went to a bar

1723
01:16:25,940 --> 01:16:28,440
他們在早上8點鐘去酒吧看他的比賽
At 8:00 in the morning to watch him on tv.

1724
01:16:28,450 --> 01:16:31,280
{\i1}（葡萄牙語）{\i}

1725
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:34,380
{\i1}（日語）{\i}

1726
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:37,520
{\i1}（西班牙語）{\i}

1727
01:17:00,610 --> 01:17:02,350
他把一切都處理得很好
He's handled everything very well,

1728
01:17:02,350 --> 01:17:03,810
像你說的，鎮定自若
As you said, unflappable,

1729
01:17:03,820 --> 01:17:05,680
如果還要挑刺的話
（chink in the armor：俗語，帶有對中國人的嘲諷意味）
But if there is a chink in the armor,

1730
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:07,750
他還應該在哪些方面提高？
Where can lin improve his game?

1731
01:17:08,550 --> 01:17:10,050
Chink in the armor...

1732
01:17:10,050 --> 01:17:11,590
a chink in the armor...

1733
01:17:11,590 --> 01:17:13,120
很強壯，臂展很長
Nice build, he's got long arms.

1734
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:14,390
這是一個合格控衛需要具備的
That's what you need as a point guard.

1735
01:17:14,390 --> 01:17:15,630
他實在是
And he's really, I mean...

1736
01:17:15,630 --> 01:17:18,290
他的眼神呢？（暗諷亞洲人的眼睛小）
What about his eyes?

1737
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:19,400
迷離
Dreamy.

1738
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:21,400
他的視野很好
He has great court vision.

1739
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:23,300
如果不用Lin做雙關語
Take away the lin puns...Mm-hmm.

1740
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:25,640
結果是這樣的
This is what you end up with.

1741
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:27,240
令人驚「亞」
{\i1}（"Amasian": amazing和asian的合體）{\i}
"amasian."

1742
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:28,340
這......
now is that even...now is that even...

1743
01:17:28,340 --> 01:17:29,870
這合法嗎？
now is that even...Is that even legal?

1744
01:17:29,870 --> 01:17:33,510
是的，這是林書豪
Jeremy lin. Yes, that's real.

1745
01:17:33,510 --> 01:17:36,110
他是從幸運餅乾里蹦出來的
（幸運餅乾：美國中餐廳常見食品）
Jeremy lin coming out of a fortune cookie.

1746
01:17:36,110 --> 01:17:38,810
這一切證明我們是多麼措手不及
This whole thing has shown how unprepared

1747
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:41,950
來面對這種文化
We were to deal with this culture in this context.

1748
01:17:41,950 --> 01:17:45,290
Floyd Mayweather（黑人拳擊手）在推特上評論林書豪說
Floyd mayweather on jeremy lin tweets...

1749
01:17:45,290 --> 01:17:47,420
這些炒作不過因為他是亞裔
"all the hype is because he's asian.

1750
01:17:47,430 --> 01:17:49,290
黑人球員每晚都有他那樣的表現
"black players do what he does every night

1751
01:17:49,290 --> 01:17:50,790
卻沒有得到同等的稱讚
And don't get the same praise."

1752
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,700
首先，我認為他的話是種族歧視
First of all, what he said I think is racist.

1753
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:56,230
他不但可以在NBA立足
Not only can he compete and make it in the nba,

1754
01:17:56,230 --> 01:17:59,700
他還不斷創造紀錄
The guy's tearing it up and is breaking records, you knucklehead.

1755
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:02,270
看看這張圖，他用數學取得勝利
Check it out. "he does the math to win."

1756
01:18:02,270 --> 01:18:04,670
沒錯
yeah.

1757
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:07,200
我們對亞裔的很多觀念根深蒂固
For many years, we've had many stereotypes about asian-americans,

1758
01:18:07,530 --> 01:18:09,200
現在一窩蜂全出來了
我們還都覺得這些都是小意思
And now they're all kind of coming
out like they're no big deal.

1759
01:18:09,530 --> 01:18:11,180
它們很要緊
They are a big deal.

1760
01:18:11,180 --> 01:18:12,550
這一天終於來了
And that'll do it.

1761
01:18:12,550 --> 01:18:14,380
（尼克斯隊）的連勝終止
The winning streak comes to an end

1762
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:15,650
以令人失望的方式
In disappointing fashion,

1763
01:18:15,650 --> 01:18:17,220
新奧爾良黃蜂隊
As the new orleans hornets

1764
01:18:17,220 --> 01:18:21,600
讓林書豪和尼克斯隊吞下
林書豪時代以來第一場失利的苦果
Hand jeremy lin and the knicks their first loss in the jeremy lin era.

1765
01:18:22,860 --> 01:18:24,460
現在變得更簡單了
Now it's easier for me, you know.

1766
01:18:24,460 --> 01:18:26,030
如果有人說了種族歧視的話
Someone will say something racist,

1767
01:18:26,030 --> 01:18:29,070
我會一笑而過，覺得很有趣
And I'll laugh, and I'll think it's funny.

1768
01:18:29,070 --> 01:18:32,330
我會把所有負面的東西
Everything I get now, like, all the negative stuff,

1769
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:33,970
都放到一個地方
I'll just put it in one place

1770
01:18:33,970 --> 01:18:35,470
然後把它們變成積極的東西
And turn it into positive stuff

1771
01:18:35,470 --> 01:18:36,870
讓我正確地使用
So that I could use it the right way,

1772
01:18:36,870 --> 01:18:40,010
當我帶著憤怒打球，我就會打得很爛
And when I play out of anger, I play horrible.

1773
01:18:40,010 --> 01:18:44,150
所以我學會控制自己的情緒
And so I had to learn how to control my emotions

1774
01:18:44,150 --> 01:18:46,850
然後讓它隨風而去
And then just, like, let it go.

1775
01:19:30,660 --> 01:19:32,930
手不要受傷
Don't break your hand.

1776
01:20:23,780 --> 01:20:26,150
你知道嗎？尼克斯隊的林書豪
So did you know that new knicks sensation, jeremy lin,

1777
01:20:26,150 --> 01:20:27,780
還有一個弟弟現在才大一，也打控衛
Has a brother who's a freshman point guard

1778
01:20:27,790 --> 01:20:29,080
好像是漢密爾頓學院
For hamilton college?

1779
01:20:29,090 --> 01:20:30,720
我們當然知道，不過就算不知道
We did, though even we didn't know

1780
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,120
在今天的分區決賽上
That today's continental home finale

1781
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:34,020
我們看到林書豪的整個家庭都來了
Would bring out the entire lin clan,

1782
01:20:34,030 --> 01:20:36,790
包括林書豪本人
Including the linsational jeremy himself.

1783
01:20:36,790 --> 01:20:39,760
我不知道他會來看我的比賽
I did not know he was coming to my game,

1784
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:45,430
我在學校裏確實聽到有人這樣說
And I actually heard from a couple people on campus like,

1785
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:47,640
「嘿，聽說你哥要來」
"hey, your brother's coming."

1786
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:50,940
我的反應是，「不，他不會來的」
I was like, "no, he's not."

1787
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:53,640
從來沒有過
I've never really had that before,

1788
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:58,510
我的一場比賽有那麼大的關注
Had that kind of hype around one of my games.

1789
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:01,050
但我覺得這並沒有很大區別
But I didn't see it as that big of a difference.

1790
01:21:01,050 --> 01:21:03,650
不過就是家人來看我的比賽
It was just my family watching my game, so...

1791
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:07,020
在「林瘋狂」之前他就有來看過
I mean, he did come down before linsanity happened.

1792
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:09,360
在那之前，他來看比賽時
He had come down to watch my games before that,

1793
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:10,890
完全沒有人會關心
And no one really cared.

1794
01:21:13,830 --> 01:21:15,260
過去兩年
For the last, like, two years,

1795
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:19,000
他在球場上一直鬱鬱不得志
He was never enjoying himself out there.

1796
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,400
直到與籃網隊的那場比賽過後
But that new jersey game, when things were rolling,

1797
01:21:21,410 --> 01:21:24,640
我第一次覺得，他在享受比賽
For the first time, he was just, like, having fun,

1798
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:26,210
活在自己的夢想之中
Living his dream.

1799
01:21:26,210 --> 01:21:31,050
我覺得這才是「林瘋狂」給他帶來的，最美好的東西
I think that was, like, the best thing from linsanity.

1800
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:36,490
現在最重要的問題是：「林瘋狂」能繼續嗎？
The big question now is, can linsanity continue?

1801
01:21:36,490 --> 01:21:38,590
我不知道這將持續多久
I don't know how long it's gonna last,

1802
01:21:38,590 --> 01:21:39,960
但現在，我不在乎
But right now, I don't care.

1803
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:42,060
林書豪底角嘗試三分
Lin out of the corner for 3.

1804
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:44,790
球進了！
Count 'em all!

1805
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:47,930
如果有人說預料到這一切，那是在瞎說
Anyone who said they saw this coming is lying!

1806
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:51,800
他能做到的遠不止於人們以為的那樣
There's a lot more that he can do

1807
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:54,440
他的信心已經今非昔比
Than anybody knew, and it comes down to confidence.

1808
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:55,540
林書豪突破
Jeremy on the drive.

1809
01:21:55,540 --> 01:21:57,540
2+1打成
And-1 for jeremy lin!

1810
01:21:57,540 --> 01:21:59,910
打進還造成犯規
He got the bang and the bucket.

1811
01:21:59,910 --> 01:22:01,810
他有自己的招牌
He's got that swagger.

1812
01:22:01,810 --> 01:22:03,110
他現在很有范兒
He has that "it" right now.

1813
01:22:03,110 --> 01:22:05,750
這超越了體育的範疇
This transcends sports. It really does.

1814
01:22:05,750 --> 01:22:07,480
他在當今體育界最美妙的故事裏大放光芒
He has shined and evolved into {\i1}the{\i} best story in sports today.

1815
01:22:07,490 --> 01:22:10,650


1816
01:22:10,660 --> 01:22:11,990
在後場施加壓力
Pressure in the backcourt.

1817
01:22:11,990 --> 01:22:14,990
林書豪搶斷，直搗黃龍
Oh, and lin the steal! To the basket!

1818
01:22:25,270 --> 01:22:27,470
林書豪面對德克·諾維茨基的防守
Lin, over dirk.

1819
01:22:27,470 --> 01:22:29,510
噢噢噢！
Ohh!

1820
01:22:29,510 --> 01:22:31,670
太精彩了
How good is this?

1821
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:35,540
我只是想去享受比賽
I'm just out there having fun

1822
01:22:35,550 --> 01:22:36,850
打好球
And playing a game.

1823
01:22:36,850 --> 01:22:39,180
我會有表現不好的時候
I can have bad games, and, you know,

1824
01:22:39,180 --> 01:22:41,980
他們也許會不喜歡我，會噓我
They may not like me, or they may boo me.

1825
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:43,550
但生命中有很多事情遠比籃球重要
There's a lot more important things in life than just basketball.

1826
01:22:43,550 --> 01:22:45,290


1827
01:22:45,290 --> 01:22:48,220
畢竟籃球只是一場遊戲
'cause at the end of the day, basketball's just a game.

1828
01:22:48,230 --> 01:22:51,190
這場秀還在繼續
The show continues on broadway.

1829
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:55,560
這個故事有很多亮點
It's a story with many spokes.

1830
01:22:55,570 --> 01:22:57,930
常春藤，美籍亞裔運動員
An ivy leaguer, asian-american athlete,

1831
01:22:57,940 --> 01:22:59,770
從替補席橫空出世
Guy off the end of the bench.

1832
01:22:59,770 --> 01:23:02,170
為所有沒有得到機會的人代言
Speaks for everyone who didn't get their chance.

1833
01:23:02,170 --> 01:23:05,610
只是短短的幾周，在紐約城
It's only a couple of weeks, but in new york city,

1834
01:23:05,610 --> 01:23:07,780
在籃球這一大舞台上
And on basketball's big stage,

1835
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:09,410
他已經把故事帶出了籃球這個公園
This guy has hit it out of the park.

1836
01:23:11,250 --> 01:23:13,080
在我身上發生的故事
What happened to me, the story that happened to me,

1837
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:15,250
並不是說，我早就知道
I mean, it wasn't like I knew

1838
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:17,220
我能從替補席上來完成那些事情
I could just come off the bench and do that.

1839
01:23:17,220 --> 01:23:18,390
我真的不知道
I really didn't.

1840
01:23:18,390 --> 01:23:20,890
我覺得自己有這個水平
Um, I thought I could play at this level,

1841
01:23:20,890 --> 01:23:22,260
我覺得自己可以成為好的球員
And I thought I could be a good player,

1842
01:23:22,260 --> 01:23:24,160
但我沒想到會發生這一系列事情
But I didn't feel like that would happen.

1843
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:26,960
有些球場上的經歷
And some of those experiences out there when I was on the court,

1844
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:28,960


1845
01:23:28,970 --> 01:23:31,130
我覺得自己是被別的力量控制著
I felt like I was being controlled by something else.

1846
01:23:31,140 --> 01:23:33,770
有些完全超出肉體
I felt like I was having an out-of-body experience.

1847
01:23:33,770 --> 01:23:35,870
我完成的一些得分
Some of the plays that I made,

1848
01:23:35,870 --> 01:23:37,640
我們的一些勝利
Some of the wins that we had,

1849
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:40,110
真的超出了這個世界
Were just so out of this world

1850
01:23:40,110 --> 01:23:42,950
我時常還要掐一下自己
That I still have to pinch myself

1851
01:23:42,950 --> 01:23:46,350
才能相信這是真的
To really believe it.

1852
01:23:47,350 --> 01:23:51,980
{\i1}職業生涯前9場首發比賽中{\i}

1853
01:23:52,150 --> 01:23:55,000
{\i1}場均9.9次助攻，2.2次搶斷{\i}

1854
01:23:57,750 --> 01:23:59,920
{\i1}25.0分{\i}

1855
01:24:04,530 --> 01:24:08,530
{\i1}在NBA 65年的歷史中
這個記錄前無古人{\i}

1856
01:24:11,530 --> 01:24:19,530
{\i1}他創紀錄式的表現過後
在休賽期成為自由球員{\i}

1857
01:24:21,530 --> 01:24:27,530
{\i1}他只收到休斯頓火箭隊的報價
並最終簽下3年2500萬美元的合同{\i}

1858
01:24:36,530 --> 01:24:40,400
{\i1}隨著林書豪翻開新的篇章{\i}
{\i1}As jeremy ends one chapter and begins another,{\i}

1859
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:44,010
{\i1}前面的路將不斷地考驗他的毅力{\i}
{\i1}The road ahead will continue to test his perseverance.{\i}

1860
01:24:45,180 --> 01:24:48,380
{\i1}他的信念將永遠指引他{\i}
{\i1}But his faith will forever guide him.{\i}

1861
01:24:52,950 --> 01:24:55,150
去年我學會了
The thing I had to learn last year

1862
01:24:55,150 --> 01:24:56,520
完美的計劃並不是
Is a perfect plan doesn't mean

1863
01:24:56,520 --> 01:25:00,490
所有的事情都如你所願
That it ends up the way you want it to end up.

1864
01:25:00,490 --> 01:25:02,760
如果你之前問我，什麼是完美的計劃
In the past, if you asked me what's a perfect plan,

1865
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:03,960
我可能會答，「心想事成」
I'd be like, "I get what I want,

1866
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:06,100
「打好球，實現夢想」
I get my dream, I play well."

1867
01:25:09,030 --> 01:25:10,900
現在我有新的看法
Now I have a different perspective

1868
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:13,440
關於什麼才是完美的計劃
On what a perfect plan is.

1869
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:17,140
如果你一直贏，你不會成長
You don't get better if you win all the time.

1870
01:25:17,140 --> 01:25:18,940
只有失敗才會讓你成長
You know, you get better when you lose.

1871
01:25:18,940 --> 01:25:20,310
失敗讓你提高
You improve when you lose.

1872
01:25:20,310 --> 01:25:22,210
失敗讓你更加反思自我
You look at yourself more when you lose.

1873
01:25:22,210 --> 01:25:24,850
如果你我都學到很多
So if you learn a lot or if I learn a lot,

1874
01:25:24,850 --> 01:25:26,320
如果我有很好的成長
If I grow a lot,

1875
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:29,650
如果我隨著時間流逝變成更好的人
If I become a better person through tough times,

1876
01:25:29,650 --> 01:25:31,090
這才是神的完美計劃的一部分
That's part of his perfect plan.

1877
01:25:31,090 --> 01:25:33,060
才是神的完美旨意的一部分
That's part of his perfect will.

1878
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:52,040
如果我感到缺乏安全感
When I was going through all my insecurities

1879
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:54,110
失去信心
And uncertainty and lack of confidence,

1880
01:25:54,110 --> 01:25:56,850
那是因為我分散了對神的專注
I was losing focus on god.

1881
01:25:56,850 --> 01:25:58,410
我把注意力放到別的事情上了
I was focusing on all these other things,

1882
01:25:58,420 --> 01:26:02,080
比如我的工作和別人的想法
Like my job and what other people thought of me

1883
01:26:02,090 --> 01:26:05,120
以及各種對我的報道
And what the reporters were writing.

1884
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:08,820
但隨著時間流逝，我會反思自己
You know, over time, I was able to check myself

1885
01:26:08,830 --> 01:26:10,860
找回我對神的專注
And kind of get my focus back.

1886
01:26:12,260 --> 01:26:14,230
我覺得神對我做了一些超自然的事情
And I think god did something supernatural in me,

1887
01:26:14,230 --> 01:26:17,070
一些我無法以一己之力完成的事情
Something that I couldn't do on my own,

1888
01:26:17,070 --> 01:26:21,000
有些我也許永遠無法複製
Something that I may never be able to recreate.

1889
01:26:22,270 --> 01:26:23,910
所以在那件事上
So I think, in that instance,

1890
01:26:23,910 --> 01:26:27,480
我只是學著去奮鬥
I was just learning to fight

1891
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:30,510
去為了神而生活和打球
To constantly live and play for god.

1892
01:26:30,510 --> 01:26:34,150
如果我做到這些，我就能完成看似不可能的事情
And when I do that, I'll be able to walk on water.

1893
01:27:02,210 --> 01:27:03,910
上面全是《獅子王》的角色
It's all about {\i1}lion king.{\i}

1894
01:27:03,910 --> 01:27:05,410
這裏有娜娜
We have nala right here,

1895
01:27:05,530 --> 01:27:09,060
還有小辛巴，丁滿和彭彭
Baby simba, timon and pumbaa.

1896
01:27:09,860 --> 01:29:14,730
