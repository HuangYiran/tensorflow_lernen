2
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Victor, I don't know that it's...

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Mom, you have to wear the glasses.

4
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- It's 3D, honey. - Yes, Of course.

5
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So that's where my candlestick went.

6
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Isn't that your grandmother's tablecloth?

7
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yeah.

8
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- That looks great.

9
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Whoa! I just felt like I was attacked!

10
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Send in the marines!

11
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Over here, men! This way!

12
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Oh! - Whoa!

13
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Watch out!

14
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Sparky! - Sparky, that's you!

15
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You tell them, Sparky.

16
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Whoo!

17
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, my!

18
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Bravo!

19
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Oh! - Oh, Oh!

20
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Oh!

21
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Um... - Oh!

22
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Maybe just unplug it.

23
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, it certainly was exciting.

24
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yeah, it was a big finish. Well done, son.

25
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I can fix this. Come on, boy.

26
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}All that time he spends up there.

27
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}A boy his age needs to be outside with his friends.

28
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I don't know that Victor has friends, dear. Other than Sparky.

29
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That's my point.

30
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I don't want him to turn out, you know, weird.

31
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}There's nothing wrong with Victor. He's just in his own world.

32
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Easy, boy.

33
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}See you later, sweetie.

34
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Have a good day.

35
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Victor! Come on, honey. You're going to be late.

36
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Go put Sparky in the back yard.

37
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Come on, Sparky!

38
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Good morning, Mr. Burgemeister.

39
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Your dog has been sniffing around my Dutch Dazzlers.

40
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The other day I caught him peeing on my flamingo.

41
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'll keep an eye on him.

42
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You better.

43
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yes, sir.

44
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Go on, Sparky. That's right!

45
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Good boy. See you later!

46
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Where do you think you're going?

47
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}School.

48
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What about that dog of yours?

49
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}She's not in the house and she's away from your tulips.

50
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I want you to remember something.

51
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}While your parents are away, I am in charge here.

52
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yes, Uncle Bob.

53
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Dutch Day is coming up, and I don't need any trouble.

54
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- How's your song coming? - Okay.

55
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Keep at it!

56
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Dutch Day is a big day for me.

57
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yes, sir.

58
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Good morning, children.

59
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I am Mr. Rzykruski.

60
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I will be your new science teacher.

61
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Apparently, Mr. Holcomb had an incident.

62
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He got hit by lightning!

63
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, that is bad.

64
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But he did not get "hit" by lightning.

65
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:58,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Lightning does not hit a person the way one is hit by a baseball or a cabbage.

66
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Lightning is simply electricity.

67
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The cloud is angry. Yes. Making storm.

68
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}All the electrons are saying, "I am leaving you!"

69
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}"I go to the land of opportunity!"

70
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The ground says,

71
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}"Yes, we need electrons trained in science just like you!"

72
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}"Come. Come! Welcome."

73
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So both sides start to build a ladder.

74
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}This man, he comes out to look at the storm.

75
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He does not see the invisible ladders.

76
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}When the two ladders meet... Boom!

77
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The circuit is complete

78
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}and all of the electrons rush to the land of opportunity.

79
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}This man is in the way!

80
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ahh!

81
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But it is very rare to have such an incident.

82
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But it's not rare.

83
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Lightning happens to people all the time here.

84
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}There's a thunderstorm almost every night.

85
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}My dad got hit twice.

86
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:09,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}They built New Holland on an abandoned gold mine.

87
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I heard it was a cemetery.

88
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That's where they buried the miners.

89
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's the windmill that does it.

90
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:27,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Turning, turning the air until the sky itself rages against the night.

91
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No. Cemetery. Definitely.

92
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:54,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Students, on your way out, take a permission slip for the science fair.

93
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}First prize is a huge trophy!

94
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Hello, Victor.

95
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hi.

96
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Mr. Whiskers had a dream about you last night.

97
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}How do you know?

98
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Because this morning he made this.

99
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh.

100
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Did you get that out of the litter box?

101
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's an omen.

102
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Last month he dreamed about Bob.

103
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He fell in a manhole.

104
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He dreamed about Toshiaki

105
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:49,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}the day he pitched a perfect game.

106
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And Nassor the day he got knocked unconscious.

107
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}If Mr. Whiskers dreams about you,

108
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}it means something big is going to happen.

109
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You can keep it.

110
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}One day you'll dream about me, won't you, Kitty?

111
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hey, boy. How are you doing?

112
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You'll be my partner, right, Victor?

113
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Because you have to have a partner for the science fair,

114
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}and whoever is your partner is going to win.

115
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You know the most about science so pick me as a partner.

116
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I have lots of ideas!

117
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We can make a death ray!

118
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It says no death rays. See?

119
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, man.

120
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I still want to do it. Come on.

121
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Who else would be your partner?

122
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You don't have friends and neither do I.

123
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm sorry, Edgar. I just don't need a partner.

124
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I like to work alone.

125
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Will you sign my permission slip?

126
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Dinner's ready.

127
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Victor, have I ever talked to you about what I do for a living?

128
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You're a travel agent?

129
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I sell dreams.

130
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I tell people, "You can sail to Italy."

131
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}"You can do the hula in Hawaii."

132
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Will you sign my form? - I'm getting to that.

133
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Okay.

134
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}In my job, sometimes you have people

135
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}who don't want quite the same thing, right?

136
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Say a husband wants to play golf in Scotland

137
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}but the wife wants to paddle down the Amazon.

138
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}All right, you've got two conflicting ideas here.

139
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And it's my job, Victor, to help them meet halfway.

140
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Say... Scottsdale, Arizona.

141
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He gets to golf, she gets Indians.

142
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But there's no river. And no jungle.

143
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Nobody gets what they want. - Exactly.

144
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And wrong.

145
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}They both get what they want because they compromise.

146
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You'd like to do the science fair and that's great.

147
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:23,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'd like you to try a sport. Say, I don't know, baseball.

148
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Science fair, baseball. Science fair, baseball.

149
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}How do you choose? Guess what? You don't have to.

150
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No reason you can't do both.

151
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You meet in the middle. Everyone's happy.

152
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Look at what Toshiaki's doing.

153
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:49,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He's keeping his eye on the target, never losing his concentration.

154
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Strike three! Next batter!

155
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:04,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I want you to concentrate on your project for the science fair.

156
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Come on, honey!

157
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Whoa. Nice catch, Sparky.

158
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Come on, Victor, please.

159
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Tie Sparky up and get your head into the game.

160
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Time out!

161
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sorry, boy.

162
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hey, Sparky.

163
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Play ball!

164
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Strike one!

165
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Nice try, son.

166
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}When conducting an experiment, trying is the important thing.

167
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It is okay to fail as long as you keep trying!

168
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Eh?

169
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Come on, Victor. You can do it, honey.

170
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Strike two!

171
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yes!

172
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Come on, honey!

173
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Victor, run!

174
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sparky!

175
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sparky!

176
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No!

177
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He was a great dog. A great friend.

178
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The best dog a kid could have.

179
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}When you lose someone you love, they never really leave you.

180
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}They just move into a special place in your heart.

181
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He'll always be there, Victor.

182
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I don't want him in my heart. I want him here with me.

183
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I know.

184
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}If we could bring him back, we would.

185
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Try and get some sleep, sweetheart. Things will seem better in the morning.

186
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:01,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Just like lightning, the nervous system is electricity.

187
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We are wires and springs and cables to send the messages.

188
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Even after death, the wiring remains.

189
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Watch as the muscles respond to the electricity.

190
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hi, Victor! How was school?

191
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Okay.

192
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Shoo!

193
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm sorry, boy.

194
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You're alive!

195
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You're alive!

196
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sparky!

197
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You're alive!

198
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I can't believe it! You're alive!

199
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I can fix that.

200
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It worked.

201
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It really worked.

202
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Victor!

203
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Victor, breakfast!

204
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Victor?

205
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Are you up here?

206
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Shh.

207
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Quiet down, boy.

208
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Victor?

209
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sparky, Shh!

210
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Quiet.

211
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Victor!

212
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Shh!

213
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}French toast or waffles?

214
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Uh, waffles.

215
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Then I'll need my waffle iron back, Mr. Director.

216
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's my science project. It's a robot.

217
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- A robotic bucket? - Yes.

218
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- For mopping, I suppose? - Yes.

219
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Maybe when you're finished, you'll let me use it.

220
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sorry, boy, but I can't let anyone know about you.

221
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}They may not understand.

222
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So, you need to stay here today.

223
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No, couldn't be.

224
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What?

225
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I know. And Helen said she thought they were

226
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}putting up some kind of TV antenna on top of the roof.

227
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}In the middle of a thunderstorm?

228
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That's what she said.

229
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I don't believe it.

230
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And did you get that big power surge the other night?

231
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Jack thought it was a fuse box,

232
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}but apparently it affected the whole neighborhood.

233
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:41,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sometimes I wonder just what goes on in that house.

234
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I just don't feel safe walking by there.

235
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sweetie, you okay? Here you go.

236
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So anyway, Jack loves it here,

237
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}but if the schools weren't so great,

238
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}sometimes I wonder if we'd be better off closer to my mother.

239
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sparky?

240
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hmm.

241
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Hi, Victor. How was school? - Good. Got to go.

242
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sparky?

243
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sparky?

244
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}There you are.

245
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Good boy. Sorry you had to stay here alone all day.

246
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What's the matter, boy? Are you okay?

247
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hmm. You're a little low.

248
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Are you hungry, boy?

249
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}All right, here. Let's top you up.

250
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Victor? Could you come down here, please?

251
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Victor!

252
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Your friend is here.

253
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Edgar?

254
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hey.

255
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Edgar, what are you doing here?

256
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- I know. - What?

257
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I know.

258
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Know what? - You know.

259
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No.

260
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I think I know what you know I know.

261
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:46,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Look, I don't know what you think I know, but I don't know it.

262
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Your dog is alive!

263
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:57,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That's impossible. - I know.

264
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I know it is so impossible, but you did it.

265
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You did it!

266
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So, show me how, or I'll tell everyone.

267
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Oh, Mrs. Frankenstein! - Shh.

268
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}May I have a cookie, please?

269
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh. Yes, of course.

270
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}All right, come on.

271
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh!

272
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I think the wind and the lightning are part of the same thing,

273
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}some kind of strange force.

274
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But the wind isn't strong enough to bring an animal back from the dead.

275
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}For that, you need lightning.

276
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So when can I do it?

277
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You can't. This isn't an experiment. It's my dog.

278
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Show-and-tell, Victor.

279
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You show me, and I won't tell.

280
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Can I help you, young man?

281
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'd like to buy a fish.

282
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Certainly. Which one?

283
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}This one.

284
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What do we do now?

285
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What happened to it? What did you do?

286
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I don't know. It should have worked.

287
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:03,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's invisible. It's an invisible goldfish.

288
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Why is it invisible? - I have no idea.

289
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You can't tell anyone. You understand that, right?

290
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Not until we figure out how it works.

291
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Okay, Okay.

292
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Promise? - Promise.

293
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}How are we supposed to see an invisible goldfish?

294
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Put your finger in. You can feel it.

295
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ah! It bit me!

296
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Let me see it.

297
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:58,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's my science project, and it's top secret!

298
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Mmm.

299
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yeah? Well, our science fair project is even cooler.

300
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- What is it? - Double top secret.

301
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sea-Monkeys?

302
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We got to come up with something better.

303
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Bigger. - I know.

304
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The science fair is in two days.

305
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I know.

306
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- You're the smart one! - I know.

307
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hmm.

308
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Okay, okay. Sit still. Shh.

309
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sparky, no! Shh. No! Shh!

310
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sorry, boy, but we can't risk anyone seeing you again.

311
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Shh!

312
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Toshiaki says you have an invisible fish.

313
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- No, he didn't. - So, you don't?

314
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I didn't say that. Who said I did?

315
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Toshiaki says it's your science fair project.

316
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}If it was, I couldn't tell you.

317
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So it isn't,

318
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}or it is?

319
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No. Yes.

320
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm confused.

321
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Do you have an invisible fish?

322
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Okay.

323
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But you have to keep it a secret.

324
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Swish your finger around. You can feel it.

325
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:05,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's just water. There's nothing there.

326
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No, it's invisible.

327
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Huh?

328
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:17,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I don't know what kind of game you and Victor are playing,

329
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}but that trophy will be mine.

330
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Victor.

331
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Something's wrong with my fish!

332
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- What is it? - It's not there any more.

333
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:32,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Maybe it just hopped out. Did you have the lid on it?

334
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yes, ever since

335
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I left your house.

336
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I mean, it was there when I went to bed.

337
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm thinking maybe they don't last.

338
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:48,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}They're only there for a little bit and then they're gone.

339
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No! Sparky!

340
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Sparky!

341
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Don't worry. I can fix that, too.

342
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Good night, boy.

343
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Mmm.

344
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Are you sure this is going to work?

345
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No. That's why it's called an "experiment."

346
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We have to collect data.

347
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Do we have to collect it on me?

348
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Ready? - No.

349
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ten, nine, eight...

350
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We could use a test dummy or something.

351
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}...seven, six, five...

352
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Computer simulation.

353
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}...four, three, two...

354
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- I have to pee! - ...one.

355
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Whoa! Whoa, whoa!

356
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:14,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Whoa, whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

357
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

358
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh!

359
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Ah!

360
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's working! It's working!

361
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What were you boys doing on the roof?

362
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Science. - Science.

363
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}As mayor of New Holland,

364
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}you have entrusted me with your safety.

365
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:14,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So I can't sit idly while a teacher endangers our children.

366
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The man is a menace!

367
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}She's right! He's crazy!

368
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Have you looked through this science book they're using?

369
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:27,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Apparently Pluto isn't good enough to be a planet any more.

370
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}When I was a kid, Pluto was a great planet.

371
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}This guy comes along and rewrites the rules!

372
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}In fairness, he didn't write the textbook.

373
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:37,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Mr. Mayor, Edward Frankenstein.

374
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Your neighbor, of course.

375
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I just would like to say that our son Victor

376
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}is just crazy about the new teacher.

377
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Thinks he's great.

378
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}My Cynthia has been asking

379
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:55,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}all sorts of strange questions about things I've never even heard of.

380
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Shouldn't we at least give the man a chance to explain himself?

381
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yes.

382
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:05,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Please come up, Mr. Menace.

383
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:29,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ladies, gentlemen.

384
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I think the confusion here is that you are all very ignorant.

385
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Is that right word, "ignorant"?

386
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:41,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I mean "stupid," "primitive," "unenlightened."

387
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:46,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You do not understand science, so you are afraid of it.

388
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:49,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Like a dog is afraid of thunder or balloons.

389
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:55,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}To you, science is magic and witchcraft because you have such small minds.

390
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I cannot make your heads bigger,

391
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:04,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}but your children's heads, I can take them and crack them open.

392
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}This is what I try to do, to get at their brains!

393
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, my.

394
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:16,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Thank you.

395
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, jeez.

396
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Be quick, boy. They'll be home any minute.

397
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:30,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Praise be New Holland

398
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Praise be New Holland

399
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:39,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Streets so wide and sidewalk

400
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The sidewalks. Okay.

401
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Praise be New Holland

402
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No! Shh. No!

403
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No, no, no! Shh!

404
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Victor?

405
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Victor?

406
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hi, Elsa. What are you doing?

407
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Practicing my song for Dutch Day.

408
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's nice.

409
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Did you get a new dog? - No.

410
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- I heard a bark. - Yeah, that was me.

411
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You are barking?

412
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hmm. You must really miss Sparky.

413
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Uh, I got to go. Bye.

414
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:33,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Bye.

415
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:41,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I feel so sad for him, Persephone.

416
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He really misses his dog.

417
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Where's Mr. Rzykruski?

418
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:56,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}All I know is I'll be teaching the class for the rest of the semester.

419
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Do you know anything about science?

420
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:00,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I know more than you do.

421
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Mr. Rzykruski knew a lot.

422
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, sometimes knowing too much is the problem.

423
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What about the science fair?

424
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:12,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, it's still on, but it will be judged by someone who's not insane!

425
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Me!

426
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Now get cracking, and may the best person win!

427
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:23,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I can't believe they let the gym teacher be the judge.

428
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:26,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}She's not even interested in science.

429
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Back home, everyone is scientist.

430
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:32,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Even my plumber wins Nobel Prize.

431
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Your country does not make enough scientist.

432
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Always needs more.

433
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You should be a scientist, Victor.

434
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Nobody likes scientists.

435
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:46,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}They like what science gives them, but not the questions, no.

436
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:49,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Not the questions that science asks.

437
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Actually, I have a question.

438
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:58,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That is why you are a scientist.

439
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:03,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I was doing my experiment, my project, and the first time it worked great,

440
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}but the next time it didn't.

441
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:07,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I mean, it sort of worked, but then it didn't.

442
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:09,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And I don't know why.

443
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:13,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Then maybe you never really understood it the first time.

444
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:19,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}People think science is here, but it is also here.

445
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:23,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The first time, did you love your experiment?

446
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:24,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yes.

447
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:26,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ah.

448
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And the second time?

449
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No. I just wanted it over.

450
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Then you changed the variables.

451
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:44,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I was doing it for the wrong reason.

452
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:47,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Science is not good or bad, Victor.

453
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:51,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But it can be used both ways.

454
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:55,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That is why you must always be careful.

455
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I can't believe I broke my arm for nothing.

456
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:12,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}None of us are going to win! E has an invisible fish!

457
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:16,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No, he doesn't. You fell for a parlor trick.

458
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You're saying he faked it?

459
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:28,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That fish you showed us, was it real?

460
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:32,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It was, and it was dead, too.

461
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You brought an animal back from the dead?

462
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No, Victor did.

463
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:42,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}With lightning, and boom, and sss.

464
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:44,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Impossible.

465
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:48,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I swear! I mean, he already brought back his dog.

466
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:52,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He brought back Sparky?

467
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:57,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Mmm.

468
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:02,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Victor will win the science fair unless we can do better.

469
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:04,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Bigger.

470
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:07,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You say you know Victor's secret?

471
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:10,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Now is your chance to prove it.

472
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Now, where's my muffin tin?

473
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Victor.

474
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sparky?

475
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:09,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sparky! But you're...

476
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sparky's alive!

477
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sparky?

478
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hey, come on!

479
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:24,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Mom? Dad? What's going on?

480
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sparky! No! Sparky!

481
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sparky. no!

482
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sparky, come back!

483
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:33,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sparky!

484
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hey, hey! Just a minute!

485
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:37,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No! I have to go find Sparky!

486
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Victor, what have you done?

487
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:43,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You said yourself, if you could bring back Sparky, you would!

488
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:46,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yes, but that was different because we couldn't!

489
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's easy to promise the impossible.

490
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What you did was a very serious thing.

491
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Crossing the boundary between life and death.

492
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Reanimating a corpse!

493
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's very... Upsetting.

494
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:01,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I just wanted my dog back.

495
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, sweetheart.

496
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We'll help you look for Sparky

497
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:12,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}but when we get back, I think we need to have a little talk.

498
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:13,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Understood?

499
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:15,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yes.

500
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:18,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Now, let's go find your dog.

501
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sparky!

502
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sparky, are you in there?

503
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Mom, Dad! I'm going to check the school and the park.

504
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:00,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You guys do the town square, okay?

505
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Got it.

506
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:03,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sparky!

507
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sparky!

508
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:42,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Cool.

509
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Interesting.

510
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It has something to do with the lightning.

511
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:53,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I don't really understand it.

512
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:57,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, but I do!

513
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:10,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Tonight, we shall bring the dead to life!

514
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sparky! Where are you?

515
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:22,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sparky!

516
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sparky! Sparky!

517
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Thank you. Thank you so much.

518
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:39,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And now it's my pleasure

519
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:42,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}to introduce this year's Little Dutch Girl,

520
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:46,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}my niece, Elsa Van Helsing.

521
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:56,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I don't think this is safe.

522
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:00,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Nonsense! We have the fire chief over here.

523
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:06,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You know, a lot of girls would kill to be in your place.

524
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'd welcome death.

525
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:16,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Praise be New Holland

526
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:20,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Streets so wide and sidewalks clean

527
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:24,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Modest homes at modest prices

528
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:28,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Everyone's hope and dream

529
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm going to win.

530
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:52,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No, I shall win the science fair.

531
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:54,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hmm.

532
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:58,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}In our houses tight and safe

533
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:02,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We have nothing to fear

534
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:10,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ah.

535
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The tomb of Colossus.

536
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:16,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Soon you shall be awakened

537
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:20,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}and we shall be reunited once again!

538
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ah, Shelley.

539

{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}May your windmills spin forevermore

541
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:46,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Isn't she adorable?

542
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Mm.

543
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:40,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Mr. Whiskers?

544
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Mr. Whiskers?

545
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:36,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hello!

546
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:38,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Is someone there?

547
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Rise, Colossus.

548
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:19,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Rise from your tomb!

549
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:58,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Huh!

550
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:00,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Shelley?

551
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:04,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Shelley?

552
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:49,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sparky!

553
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:53,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sparky!

554
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:08,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sparky?

555
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:32,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sparky?

556
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:37,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sparky!

557
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:43,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sparky, it's okay, boy. It's just me.

558
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I thought that you were gone.

559
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:52,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I never want to lose you.

560
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:58,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Promise you'll never go running off, okay?

561
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:03,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Come on, boy.

562
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:22,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Was someone else here?

563
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:51,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Victor! I need your help. - Did you see those things?

564
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:53,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- They were like... - Sea-Monkeys!

565
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:54,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You know how on the package, they're like,

566
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:57,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}in a happy kingdom and everyone's smiling?

567
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Yeah? - They're not like that at all.

568
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:02,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Victor! I need your help. - I asked him first!

569
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:03,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}My problem bigger!

570
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:13,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yeah, he's right.

571
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:24,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Okay, let's go!

572
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:33,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And now for our next act,

573
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:36,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}we have something really big.

574
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:13,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No! Get away!

575
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:53,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, oh!

576
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:56,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}This way! In here!

577
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:33,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Go, Colossus.

578
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:43,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Kill! Kill!

579
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:44,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Kill!

580
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:01,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Colossus?

581
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:09,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Mm! Mm-mm!

582
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:13,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Get away from me!

583
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:16,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Get away from me!
