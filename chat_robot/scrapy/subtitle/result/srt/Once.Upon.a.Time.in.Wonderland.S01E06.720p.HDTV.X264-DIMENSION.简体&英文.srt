1
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,600
没人相信爱丽丝
No one believed Alice

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,820
所说的仙境冒险
when she spoke of her adventures in wonderland

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,080
她是如何爱上精灵塞勒斯
Of how she fell in love with a Genie named Cyrus

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,020
红心王后又是如何拆散他们的 
And how the Red Queen tore them apart.

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:12,850
不
No!

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,690
她被关进一家精神病院
She was locked away in an asylum.

7
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,770
爱丽丝  她需要帮助
Alice. She needs help.

8
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:20,080
所以红桃杰克和我带她回了仙境
So the Knave of Hearts and I brought her back to Wonderland

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,590
寻找她的真爱
to search for her true love.

10
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:23,200
他在这里  我能感觉到
He's here. I can feel it.

11
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,240
有人想阻止她
There are those who will try to stop her.

12
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,390
让那个女孩许下三个愿
What we want can't be accomplished

13
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,280
我们的目的才能达成
until the girl's made all her wishes.

14
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,300
但是爱丽丝的伟大冒险
But alice's greatest adventure

15
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,620
刚刚开始
has just begun.

16
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,830
《仙境奇缘》前情提要
Previously in Wonderland...

17
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,330
父亲  是我
Father, it's me!

18
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:40,050
你绝对不会相信我去了哪里
You're never going to believe where I've been!

19
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:40,870
爱丽丝
Alice.

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,270
你把魔尘给我弄来
You get me the dust,

21
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:44,890
我就帮你找你的精灵
and I'll help you find your Genie.

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,650
因为今天我们就将逃离此地
Today's the day we get out of here.

23
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,430
现在我想出去走走
I'd like to take a trip now.

24
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,860
-去哪  -你知道去哪
- Where to? - You know where.

25
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,360
我想去贝特莱姆皇家医院
I'm looking for Bethlem Royal Hospital.

26
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:35,790
离这里远吗
Is it near?

27
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:38,570
这是...
What is...

28
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,020
你是...
Who are...

29
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,560
贝特莱姆  精神病院
Bethlem. The asylum.

30
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,490
在哪里
Where is it?

31
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,160
往东走
East of here,

32
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,370
过了威斯敏斯特大桥就是
Just past Westminster Bridge.

33
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:53,750
看吧
See?

34
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,920
这不是很容易嘛
That wasn't so difficult, was it?

35
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,420
不得不夸您一句
And I must compliment you.

36
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,300
这套西装真不错
That is a very nice suit.

37
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:13,460
贝特莱姆精神病院

38
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,790
鸦片酊

39
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:27,880
你好
Hello?

40
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,470
请问有什么事吗
Can I help you?

41
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:31,900
但愿如此
I certainly hope so.

42
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,800
我是谢菲尔德医生
My name is Dr. Sheffield.

43
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,960
我刚刚来到伦敦
I've just arrived in London

44
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,630
想向您请教一下
and I was hoping to pick your brain

45
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,630
之前一个病人的问题
about a former patient?

46
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,270
没问题  我一向乐于为同行帮忙
Yes, of course. Always happy to help a colleague.

47
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,630
进来吧  请坐
Come in. Have a seat

48
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,180
我这里有点乱请别介意
You'll have to excuse the mess

49
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:47,870
没想到会有客人来
I wasn't expecting anyone.

50
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,490
没关系
That's quite all right.

51
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,790
我想这里的访客应该不多
I imagine you don't get many visitors here.

52
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,650
大多数人对精神病院都有抵触
Most people tend to avoid asylums.

53
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,370
他们担心会受到这里...
They worry there might be something...

54
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,080
负面情绪的影响
contagious in the air.

55
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,390
请问您要询问哪位病人呢
So, uh, which patient were you after?

56
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,050
金发  蓝眼
Blonde hair, blue eyes.

57
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,230
你一定记得她
I'm sure you remember her.

58
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,640
名字叫爱丽丝
Name of Alice.

59
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,600
我貌似不记得
I don't recall

60
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,070
哪个病人叫爱丽丝
any Alice, I'm afraid.

61
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,730
我们这里病人太多了
We have so many patients.

62
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:25,980
你一定记得
Well, of course you do.

63
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,900
能有几个病人会跟
But how many of them escape

64
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,850
一只会说话的兔子结伴逃跑呢
in the company of a talking rabbit?

65
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,760
我不知道你在说什么
I have no idea what you mean.

66
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,600
真的吗  就算是亲眼看到也不相信吗
Really? Even after you saw it with your own two eyes?

67
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:40,920
会说话的兔子
A talking rabbit?

68
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,790
太离谱了
That's madness.

69
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:47,150
有时候最离谱的故事
Sometimes the maddest stories...

70
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,150
才是最可信的
are the truest ones.

71
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,730
快拿走
Put it away.

72
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,200
求你了
Please.

73
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,860
我一直在努力忘掉那件事
I've tried so hard to forget.

74
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:06,970
好吧
Yes, well...

75
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,690
我希望你现在能够回忆起来
What I need you to do now is remember.

76
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:13,020
你的专长是探知人们的思想
Your speciality is getting inside heads.

77
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,840
现在  我要探知她的一切
Now... I want to get inside hers.

78
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,750
我需要了解爱丽丝的所有事
I need to know everything about Alice.

79
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:36,660
有人吗
Hello?

80
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,100
贾法尔
Jafar?

81
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,270
我觉得他不在这里  陛下
I don't think he's here, your Majesty.

82
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:44,250
我觉得这里没人  亲爱的
I don't think anyone's here, darling.

83
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,980
贾法尔  卫兵都不见踪影
Not Jafar, not the guards,

84
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,720
最重要的是精灵也不在了
and more importantly, the Genie.

85
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:51,300
现在我非常好奇
Now this has got me quite curious.

86
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,640
如果有谁能告诉他们去哪了
If only someone could tell me where they went.

87
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,010
我或许是贾法尔的犯人
I may be Jafar's prisoner,

88
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,940
但不是你的
but I'm not yours.

89
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,840
我不会回答你的任何问题
You will get no answers from me.

90
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,750
没必要这么粗鲁
Oh, now, no need to be rude.

91
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,870
我们彼此还不了解呢
We don't even know one another.

92
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,950
现在了解了
Yes, now we do.

93
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,190
我可以一直这样  直到把你摔死
I can continue doing that until you're dead...

94
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,640
或者你可以张嘴说话
or you can talk.

95
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,470
贾法尔走了
Jafar is gone.

96
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,890
我不知道他去哪了
I don't know where he went.

97
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,510
但他把塞勒斯也带走了
But he brought Cyrus with him.

98
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,530
亲爱的  这笼子已经破了
Darling, the cage has been cut open.

99
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,090
贾法尔想带他走  用钥匙就可以了
If Jafar wanted to take him, he'd have used the key!

100
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:37,290
无所谓  你永远抓不到他
It doesn't matter. You will never catch him.

101
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,210
为什么
Why is that?

102
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,760
因为他身上蕴藏着世间最强大的力量
Because he carries with him the greatest power of all.

103
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,460
真爱
True love.

104
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,250
他在哪
where is he?!

105
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,970
爱丽丝  你在哪
Alice, where are you?

106
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,450
我只要跟随下山的太阳
All I have to do is follow the sun west

107
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,710
就能找到你
and I'll find you.

108
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,590
坚持住  爱丽丝
Stay strong, Alice.

109
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,370
我来找你了
I'm coming for you.

110
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,150
不许动  你这是要去哪啊
Hold on there. Where do you think you're headed?

111
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,110
我往西走
I'm heading west.

112
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,380
去找个人  你挡路了
I need to find someone, and you're blocking my way.

113
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,250
如果你一直往西走
If you keep heading west,

114
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,920
就会走进黑森林  亲爱的
you'll end up in the black forest, love.

115
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:06,590
在哪里谁到找不到
You won't find anyone there.

116
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,380
据说那里是黑暗之地
They say it's so dark,

117
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,310
连自己的鼻子都看不到
you can't even find your own nose.

118
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,940
我决定碰碰运气  谢了
I'll take my chances. Thank you.

119
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,400
这样做似乎很冒险  对吧
That seems awful dangerous, don't it?

120
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,380
一个女孩独自出行
A little girl traveling alone.

121
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:21,780
也许她不知道规矩
She might not know the rules.

122
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:25,310
有很多路是收费的  你得交买路钱
See, this here's a toll road. You needs to pay the toll.

123
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,750
乖乖的吧
Now be a good girl...

124
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,390
把项链给我们
And give us that necklace.

125
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,910
你敢碰这项链  我就把你手砍下来
You even touch this necklace, and you'll lose your hand.

126
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,740
说话注意点  亲爱的
Careful who you threaten, luv.

127
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,240
不要舍命不舍财
No bauble's worth losing your life.

128
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,350
我就是不舍
This one is.

129
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:01,220
说话注意点  亲爱的
Be carefulwho you threaten... Luv

130
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,320
谢谢你们的火把
Thanks for the light.

131
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,840
我已经失去了你一次
I already lost you once before.

132
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,110
我绝不会重蹈覆辙
I'm not gonna lose you again.

133
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,230
英格兰  维多利亚时代
一年前

134
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,660
不
No.

135
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:38,680
塞勒斯
Cyrus?

136
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,500
塞勒斯
cyrus?

137
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,650
不
No...

138
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,910
不
No.

139
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,370
你没事吧
Are you okay?

140
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:57,860
我没事
Yes, I'm fine.

141
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,470
我只是
I'm just...

142
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,810
只是迷路了
just a little lost.

143
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,990
我在找回家的路
I'm trying to find my way home.

144
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:06,940
你住在附近吗
Do you live near here?

145
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,040
以前是
I used to.

146
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,320
很早以前
A long time ago.

147
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,550
-米莉  你在哪  -米莉
- Millie, where are you? - Millie!

148
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,360
我父母  他们一定能帮你
My parents--I'm sure they can help you.

149
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:16,800
在这里
Over here!

150
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,590
米莉
Oh, Millie.

151
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,280
跟你说过不要到处乱跑的
What have we told you about running off?

152
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,900
我只是想帮忙
But I'm only trying to help.

153
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,800
她找不到家了
She can't find her way home.

154
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,330
父亲
Father.

155
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:32,690
爱丽丝
Alice?

156
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,820
我的天呐  你还活着
Oh, my god. You're alive.

157
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,270
父亲  他不在了
Oh, father. He's gone.

158
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,700
谁不在了
Who's gone?

159
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:43,370
塞勒斯  被她杀了
Cyrus. She killed him.

160
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:45,750
我不明白  爱丽丝
I don't understand. Alice...

161
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,070
你这么多年都去哪了
Where have you been all these years?

162
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,630
塞勒斯是谁
Who's Cyrus?

163
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:51,950
我要嫁的人
The man I was going to marry.

164
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,640
但是红心王后  把他杀了
But the Red Queen... She killed him.

165
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,190
-把他杀了  -别说了
- She killed him. - Hush.

166
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:01,420
你回家了
You are home now.

167
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,880
我们回头再说
We can talk about all this later.

168
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,450
父亲  这个姑娘是谁
Father, who is this girl?

169
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,200
这是爱丽丝
This is Alice.

170
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,140
你的姐姐
She's your sister.

171
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,500
同父异母的姐姐
Your half-sister.

172
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,690
你从没说起过我有个姐姐
You never told me I had a sister.

173
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,050
父亲
Father...

174
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:22,030
爱丽丝  你走了以后发生了很多事
Alice, so much has changed since you left.

175
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,580
我给你介绍一下米莉
I'd like to introduce you to Millie.

176
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,790
还有
And this--

177
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,960
这是你的继母  莎拉
this is your new mother-- Sarah.

178
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:34,500
我们现在是一家人了
This... this is your family now.

179
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,560
王后大道的尽头

180
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,790
进入者请放弃一切希望
"Abandon all hope ye who enter."

181
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:52,320
往回走

182
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,110
我什么都不会放弃  尤其是希望
I'm not going to abandon anything, certainly not hope.

183
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,750
请注意
前方是黑森林

184
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,110
这纯粹是浪费木材
Seems like an awful waste of wood,

185
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,440
竖一块牌子还不够吗
when one sign would do.

186
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:02,590
前方是无尽的黑夜

187
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,390
真有这么可怕吗
I mean, is it really that bad?

188
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:26,070
好了  爱丽丝
Okay, Alice...

189
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,150
一点点黑暗算不了什么
A little bit of darkness won't hurt anybody.

190
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,050
该死的  我的头
Bloody hell, my head.

191
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,780
拜托  老兄  能让我喝口水吗
Please, mate, can I get a sip of that water?

192
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,560
你没事吧  看起来气色不好
Are you okay? You don't look too good.

193
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:47,790
你被石化过吗
You ever been stoned?

194
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,320
像死了一样的感觉
Feels like death when you come out of it.

195
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,790
可能你吸的不是真货吧
Maybe you've been messing with the wrong stuff.

196
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,180
不  我是说"石化"  被变成石头
No, I mean "Stoned" As in turned to stone.

197
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:58,880
好吧  好吧
Sure. Sure.

198
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:00,250
真的
Yeah.

199
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:01,830
给你
Here.

200
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,840
全都给你了
Take the whole thing.

201
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,180
红桃杰克
Knave of Hearts.

202
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,300
请给和你一路的女魔头
We've got a message for that she-devil

203
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,250
带个口信
you've been traveling with.

204
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,430
爱丽丝  你们见到她了吗
Alice? You've seen her?

205
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:21,890
她是个疯子
She's mad, that one.

206
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,710
趁我们睡觉的时候  无缘无故的攻击我们
Attacked us for no reason while we were sleeping.

207
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,680
你告诉她  如果让我们再见到她
You tell her, If we meet again,

208
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,200
我们绝不会手软
we won't go easy.

209
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,050
没问题
Of course.

210
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:34,240
不过你们两个混蛋得先给我指个路
If you lads could point me in the right direction.

211
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,020
她刚刚救了我的命  我得找到她
Look, she just saved my life. I have to find her.

212
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,140
祝你好运吧
Well, good luck with that.

213
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:40,960
她往黑森林去了
She's headed to the black forest.

214
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,550
黑森林
The black forest?

215
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,120
该死的
Bloody hell.

216
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,890
对  如我们所说
Yeah. Like we said,

217
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,540
好运吧
good luck.

218
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,240
一直走直线
Keep walking in a straight line.

219
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,860
一直  朝  西走
Keep... walking... west.

220
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,760
不
Oh, no.

221
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,850
不要灭啊  求你了
Please stay alight. Please.

222
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,750
不要  不要  不要
No, no, no. No!

223
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,280
我过来了
I made it through.

224
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:53,410
我就知道不远了
I knew I was close.

225
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,480
感觉太棒了
That feels so wonderful.

226
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,000
很美吧
Beautiful, isn't it?

227
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:33,760
让你感觉非常  闲适
Makes you feel quite... mimsy.

228
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:34,770
你是谁
Who are you?

229
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,380
我是木匠
I'm the carpenter.

230
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,550
你是谁
Who are you?

231
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,130
我不太想让你知道我的名字
I'm not sure I want to give you my name.

232
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,140
你知道这是什么地方吗
Do you know where we are?

233
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,330
我一直试图定位方向
I've been trying to find my bearings.

234
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,660
这里是米堡果林
We are in the Boro Grove,

235
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,960
世上最美的地方
The most beautiful place in the world.

236
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:54,750
何不放下你的宝剑
Why don't you put down your sword

237
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,560
感觉一下
and stay a while?

238
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:58,870
我不可能留下来
I couldn't possibly.

239
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,380
我有很重要的事要做
I've got quite important things to do.

240
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,440
有什么事比晒太阳更重要呢
What could be more important than basking in the sun?

241
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:09,010
救人
S-s... saving... someone's life.

242
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,470
我一直跟着太阳
I-I've been, uh, following the sun,

243
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,910
我是说
and, uh, I mean...

244
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,260
我正在寻找
I'm trying to find, uh...

245
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,820
一个精灵
there's... Uh, there's this genie,

246
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,630
可是他
and he's, uh...

247
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,110
他遇到了麻烦
he's in trouble, and, uh...

248
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,910
至少我觉得他遇到了麻烦
uh, uh... at least I thought he was.

249
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,760
我突然不太记得了
Uh, s-suddenly I can't quite remember.

250
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,440
那你就要留下
Then you must stay.

251
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,950
这里挺漂亮的
It is quite beautiful here.

252
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:59,170
也许我该在这儿待会儿
Maybe I will stay a while.

253
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,060
她打算在这待多久
How long is she planning to stay?

254
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,000
我还不知道
I don't know yet.

255
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,260
你不担心她吗
Aren't you concerned about her--

256
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,590
先让我和她聊聊吧
Let me talk to her. Please.

257
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,950
但愿我们有个像样的卧室
I wish we had a proper bedroom...

258
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:23,730
或是换洗的衣物
or a change of clothes.

259
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,950
当然我们可以给你买新的
We can get you new things, of course.

260
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,370
我想知道的是
What I would like to know...

261
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,410
你这次打算在这留多久
how long are you planning on staying this time?

262
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,180
再也不走了
Forever.

263
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,060
仙境没有值得我留恋的东西了
There's nothing left for me in Wonderland.

264
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,490
爱丽丝
Alice...

265
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,520
有些事情你必须要明白
there's something you must understand.

266
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:50,970
我已经有了一个新家
I have a new family now,

267
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:53,300
他们也会像我一样爱你
and they will love you as I do.

268
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:55,980
可是米莉
But Millie...

269
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:59,380
她年纪还很小  而且容易受到影响
is quite young and impressionable.

270
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,040
如果你真的要留下来
If you truly want to stay,

271
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,780
就不能再提仙境
there can be no more mention of Wonderland...

272
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,290
或是那个精灵
or this... genie.

273
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:10,260
他叫塞勒斯
He had a name. Cyrus.

274
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,210
爱丽丝
Alice...

275
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,310
不管你到底去了哪里
wherever you really were...

276
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:16,160
不管发生了什么事
whatever really happened,

277
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,680
你最好把这些事都忘了
these things are best forgotten.

278
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,640
难道我要将他遗忘
So I should just sweep him under the rug,

279
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,730
就像你对妈妈
like you did with mother...

280
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,480
和对我那样吗
and with me?

281
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,980
我沉溺于过去痛苦的回忆中
I spent a long time clinging

282
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,120
已经太久了
to painful memories.

283
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,330
直到有一天我才发现  我必须放手
And then one day I realized I had to stop clinging...

284
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,770
才能拥有快乐
to be happy.

285
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:45,230
但要是没有了他
I don't think I can be happy again...

286
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,880
我再也不会快乐了
and not without him.

287
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:53,570
你会快乐的
You will be...

288
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,600
只要你愿意住在这个家里
if you want to live in this house.

289
00:17:58,810 --> 00:17:59,740
你能做到吗
Can you do that?

290
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,860
你能试着融入我们
Can you try to fit in,

291
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,120
在这个家里重拾欢乐吗
to be happy in our home?

292
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,750
我已经无处可去了
I have nowhere else to go.

293
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,570
我会试试
I'll try.

294
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,320
那么你会忘记仙境
And you will forget about Wonderland?

295
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:18,030
忘记塞勒斯吗
And this Cyrus?

296
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,580
爱丽丝
Alice.

297
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:27,600
我回来你高兴吗  父亲
Are you glad... I'm back, father?

298
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:34,820
你真的想要我留下吗
Do you really want me here?

299
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,410
我当然想  爱丽丝
Of course I do, Alice.

300
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,470
当然了
Of course.

301
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,530
塞勒斯是从这逃走的
Cyrus ran this way.

302
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,400
贾法尔那些卑鄙的守卫都在紧追其后
Jafar's filthy guards-- they all ran after him.

303
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,270
好极了  那他们很快就能抓到他了
Good. Then they'll have him apprehended in no time.

304
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,150
恰恰相反  我的小傻瓜
That, my little dimwit,

305
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,870
我们才不想他被抓到
is precisely what we do not want.

306
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,830
我不明白
I don't understand.

307
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,700
你当然不懂了  你俩双胞胎兄弟啥都不懂
Of course you don't. You tweedles never do--

308
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,510
一个比一个笨
Each one dumber than the next.

309
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,620
可是王后陛下  你不能独自去追捕他
But your majesty can't go after him alone, and...

310
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,670
而且这身打扮也不适合一位王后
that outfit is not befitting a queen.

311
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,370
不要对我
Do not tell me

312
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:16,730
指手画脚
what I can and can't do!

313
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,600
每个人都在低估我
Everyone keeps underestimating me.

314
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,600
我又不是一开始就是王后
I was not always queen.

315
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,070
我知道怎么做那些肮脏的勾当
I know how to get my hands dirty.

316
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,770
是的
Of course.

317
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:26,910
如果我独自抓到精灵
If I alone capture the genie,

318
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:28,770
我就会得到他和他的瓶子
I will have him and his bottle.

319
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,610
我就会得到一切
I will have everything.

320
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:34,320
贾法尔将会一无所有  而我将会
Jafar will have nothing, and I win...

321
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:35,790
成为这场游戏的赢家
the game.

322
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,740
爱丽丝
Alice!

323
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,130
爱丽丝
Alice!

324
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,470
爱丽丝  你
Alice, are you--

325
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:55,800
搞什么鬼
What the hell?

326
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:57,710
是瓶该死的香水吗
Is this a bloody perfume bottle?

327
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,250
你来了
You're here!

328
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,000
找到你了
Found ya.

329
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:08,730
你安然无恙
And you're in one piece.

330
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,610
看来我们俩都没事了
I guess we're both okay.

331
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:11,820
我还担心你来着
You had me worried for a bit.

332
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:14,120
什么也不要担心
Don't worry about anything.

333
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,250
这里的一切都太美好了
Everything is wonderful here.

334
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,200
你一定要来看看这个
You've got to see this!

335
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:21,280
慢一点
Slow down.

336
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,090
快来
Come on!

337
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,530
这是什么鬼东西
What the hell is that?

338
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,300
我做的  是不是很漂亮
I made it. Isn't it pretty?

339
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:36,110
这里到底是怎么回事
What the bloody hell is going on here?

340
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,080
他是谁
Who's that?

341
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:44,000
只是个木匠  不用担心他
Oh. That's just the carpenter. Don't worry about him.

342
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,840
不要担心一个拿着锯子
Right. Don't worry about the man

343
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,570
笑容诡异的人
with the saw and the scary grin.

344
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,190
说对了
Exactly.

345
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,730
你在这多久了  爱丽丝
How long have you been here, Alice?

346
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,620
不记得了
I don't remember.

347
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,210
有一会了吧
A while.

348
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,400
你把项链摘下来  就这样什么都不干
And you took the necklace off and just stopped everything

349
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,480
只摘花吗
to pick flowers?

350
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,290
可塞勒斯还被关押着对吗
With Cyrus still a prisoner?

351
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,640
是的
Yes?

352
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,400
为什么要这样
Why would you do that?

353
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:16,040
因为这样我会很开心
Because it makes me happy.

354
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:24,090
回到家  我真的很高兴
I really am so happy to be back.

355
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,090
谢谢你给我的新裙子
Thank you for my new dress.

356
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,990
我非常喜欢这些雏菊的香味
I really love the smell of those daisies.

357
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:34,910
那是大丽花  亲爱的
They're dahlias, dear.

358
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:39,190
大丽花  当然了  我一定会记住的
Dahlias. Of course. I must remember that.

359
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:42,800
我觉得你穿那条裙子很漂亮  爱丽丝
I think you look beautiful in that dress, Alice.

360
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,710
当然很漂亮
Of course she does,

361
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,880
所以我想我们该谈谈她的社会责任
which is why I think we should talk about her social obligations...

362
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:51,340
既然她死而复生了
now that she's back from the dead.

363
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:55,170
-社会责任  -我不是想讨人厌
- Social obligations? - Well, I don't want to put a fine point on it,

364
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:57,460
但你已经不是个小姑娘了
but you're not a little girl anymore.

365
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,930
是的  当然不是
No, of course not.

366
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,220
一个年轻女性应该考虑一下自己的未来
And a young woman should think about her future.

367
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,010
莎拉  拜托  她才刚刚回来
Sarah... Please. She's only just returned.

368
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:06,680
所以我们更加应该帮忙
All the more reason we have to help.

369
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,010
帮忙  怎么说
Help? With what, exactly?

370
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,970
当然是把你介绍给合适的年轻人  
Meeting a suitable young man, of course.

371
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:13,900
让你继续生活
Moving on with your life.

372
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,500
我已经跟住在路那头的达西夫人说了
I've been speaking with Mrs. Darcy down the road.

373
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,920
她的儿子还没结婚  有工作  
Her son is unmarried, employed,

374
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,290
而且也不太难看
and not awful to look at.

375
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:23,730
我们已经说好哪天一起喝茶了
We've arranged for a tea.

376
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:28,310
我只是...我不能这样
I just... I just couldn't.

377
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,540
恐怕你必须如此
I'm afraid you must.

378
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,160
我都已经安排好了
I've already made the arrangements.

379
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:33,430
只是喝茶罢了 爱丽丝 
It's just tea, Alice.

380
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,610
你肯定能做到的
Surely you can manage that much.

381
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,530
达西家的儿子会出来帮着打圆场的
The Darcy boy will carry on both halves of the conversation.

382
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,720
你只需要微笑就可以了
All you have to do is smile.

383
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,020
这对你有好处  爱丽丝
This could be good for you, Alice--

384
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,870
是一种  你知道的
A way to, you know...

385
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,970
让你忘掉烦恼的方法
forget your troubles.

386
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:48,910
爱丽丝
Alice.

387
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,010
到底怎么回事
What on earth?

388
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,580
天啊  我很抱歉
oh, god. I'm so sorry.

389
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:55,850
我只是现在还没准备好见任何年轻男士
I'm simply not ready for meeting any young men right now.

390
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,530
我想忘掉某些烦恼需要多花一点时间
I think some troubles take a bit longer to forget.

391
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,000
他往哪边走了
Where did he go?

392
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,250
他往这边跑了
well, he went this way!

393
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,380
这边
This way.

394
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,530
他过河了  你们俩往那边走  
He's in the river. You two that way.

395
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:42,060
好的  长官
Yes, sir.

396
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,640
你们跟着我  找到他的时候
You lot with me. And when you find him,

397
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,070
记住  那个混蛋杀了我们一个兄弟
remember, that bastard killed one of ours.

398
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,100
让他见见血
So make him bleed.

399
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,610
遵命  长官  跟我来
Yes, sir. Come with me.

400
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,910
走吧  爱丽丝  我们得去找塞勒斯
come on, Alice. We've got to find Cyrus.

401
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:56,270
再过一会儿吧
Maybe in a little while.

402
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,640
你摸过这些树的树皮吗  非常可爱
Have you felt the bark on this tree? It's lovely.

403
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,430
我不想摸这些破树皮
I don't want to feel the bloody bark.

404
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:02,940
我想让你恢复过来
I want you to snap out of it.

405
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,340
恢复什么啊
Snap out of what?

406
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,990
-爱丽丝  你怎么了  -没什么
- Alice, what's wrong with you? - Nothing.

407
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:09,470
头一遭啊  我的生活中什么麻烦都没有
For the first time in my life, nothing's wrong.

408
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:11,210
我很开心  他很开心
I'm happy. He's happy.

409
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:12,390
为什么你不开心
Why aren't you?

410
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,860
你对爱丽丝做了什么
What have you done to Alice?

411
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,490
我问你  你对她做了什么
I said, what did you do to her?

412
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:27,400
听着  我一般比较善良
Listen, I'm more of a lover, generally.

413
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:29,030
但如果你不说的话  
but if you don't talk,

414
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,480
我就会把你揍到说出答案为止
I will knock an answer out of you.

415
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,910
伙计  你那里有东西
Mate, you got something.

416
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,380
该死
Bloody hell!

417
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:49,850
天啊
Oh, god.

418
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,670
这可不妙
This is not good.

419
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:04,100
它让你想要留下来
It makes you want to stay.

420
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,070
爱丽丝
Alice!

421
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:09,020
爱丽丝  爱丽丝
Alice! Alice!

422
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:12,150
爱丽丝  爱丽丝  我们得立刻离开这里
Alice, Alice, we have to get out of here right bloody now.

423
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,600
爱丽丝
Alice.

424
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,790
爱丽丝是谁
Who's Alice?

425
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,280
不  塞勒斯
No. Cyrus.

426
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:36,940
塞勒斯
Cyrus!

427
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:37,710
不
No!

428
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:40,350
塞勒斯
Cyrus.

429
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:41,800
爱丽丝
Alice?

430
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:42,540
爱丽丝
Alice!

431
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,430
米莉
Millie.

432
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,000
你在这儿干什么
What are you doing in here?

433
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,330
我听到你在尖叫
I heard you screaming.

434
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,470
我做噩梦了  没什么  回去睡觉吧
It's just a bad dream, that's all. Go back to bed.

435
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,460
爸爸说我们不该害怕恶梦
Father says you should never be afraid of your bad dreams,

436
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:02,710
因为那不是真的
because they're not real.

437
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:05,860
的确像是父亲的话
That certainly sounds like father.

438
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:09,260
但是你的恶梦是真的吗
Are your bad dreams real, though?

439
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:12,020
所以你才在吃饭的时候捏碎了那个杯子
Is that why you broke that glass at dinner?

440
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,650
别说了  去睡吧
That's enough. Off to bed.

441
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:18,040
至少告诉我  谁是塞勒斯
At least tell me who Cyrus is.

442
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,330
你说什么
What did you say?

443
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:24,030
塞勒斯  你一直在叫他的名字
Cyrus. You kept yelling his name.

444
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,600
他是谁
Who is he?

445
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,640
他是个很特别的人
He's someone very special.

446
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:37,470
一个让人难以忘怀的人
Someone impossible to forget,

447
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,230
不管我怎么努力
no matter how hard I might try.

448
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,190
希望我有天也能碰见这样一个人
I hope I meet someone like that someday.

449
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,910
我相信你会的
I'm sure you will.

450
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,070
当你遇见他们的时候
And when you meet them,

451
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,700
你就再无所求
you won't wish for anything else in the whole world.

452
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:56,870
米莉  马上上床去
Millie. Get to bed this instant.

453
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,330
好的
Yes.

454
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:02,620
对不起  
I'm sorry.

455
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,630
我们不需要你说对不起  爱丽丝
We don't need you to be sorry, Alice.

456
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,960
我们需要你变得好
We need you to be better.

457
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,030
如果你不愿意放弃这些傻事
And if you won't stop believing this foolishness,

458
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:11,630
至少不要对别人提及
at least have the decency to keep it to yourself.

459
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,460
我希望变好
I want to be.

460
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,680
我想要快乐
I want to be happy.

461
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,600
我在努力
I am trying.

462
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,160
努力的不够
Not nearly hard enough.

463
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,600
我们真以为你能忘记这些荒唐事  爱丽丝
We really thought you could forget this nonsense, Alice.

464
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,740
看来我们错了
It appears we were wrong.

465
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:36,730
好了  够了
All right, that's enough.

466
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,850
你不记得塞勒斯  也不记得自己
You don't remember Cyrus. You don't remember yourself.

467
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:40,460
但别再争了  我们走
Well, no more arguments. We're going.

468
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:40,770
去哪
Go where?

469
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:42,610
离开这鬼地方  看啊  爱丽丝
The hell out of here. Look, Alice!

470
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:45,000
看到这些树了吗  它们以前都是人
You see all these trees? They all used to be people.

471
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:46,960
如果留下来  你也会变这样
That's what's gonna happen to you if you stay.

472
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,130
所以我得把你带出去
So I'm getting you're out.

473
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:49,550
不要
No!

474
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,070
我不想走
I don't want to go!

475
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,290
我不走  离我远点
I'm not leaving! Stay away from me!

476
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:55,430
冷静  冷静点
Easy. Easy!

477
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:57,240
我不会走的  别想逼我离开
I won't go! You can't make me go!

478
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,970
别管我  让我留下来
Just leave me alone! Let me stay!

479
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,190
我不想伤害你  爱丽丝
I don't wanna hurt you, Alice,

480
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:02,130
但你已经不像你自己了
but you're not yourself.

481
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:04,880
我变得更好了  这才是我想要成为的人
I'm better! I'm the person I've always wanted to be!

482
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:05,910
我现在很开心
I'm happy!

483
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:07,710
这个地方让你以为自己很快乐
This place is making you happy!

484
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:09,000
这不是真的快乐
It's not real happiness!

485
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:11,250
相信我  我知道区别在哪
Believe me. I know the difference when I see it.

486
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,450
有什么区别
And why is that?!

487
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,570
听着  有些事我从没告诉过你
Listen. There's something I never told you before.

488
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,250
当我的心脏被夺走时
When my heart was ripped from me--

489
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:20,160
我是说  真的从我胸膛里被夺走时
I mean, literally taken from my chest--

490
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,830
我以为这个空洞永远都不会再被填满了
I thought that hole could never be filled.

491
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,860
但是你帮我拿了回来
And then you got it back for me.

492
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:27,280
从那时起  我没有好好地用心
Since then, I didn't really use it properly.

493
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:29,480
我一直觉得很愧疚
I always felt guilty about that.

494
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,790
好像我受之有愧
Like you gave me something more than I deserved.

495
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:35,210
好像我欠了你什么
Like I still owe you something.

496
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,960
也许正因如此我不能让你去送死
Maybe that's why I can't let this happen.

497
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:41,070
住手
Stop!

498
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,700
把剑给我  爱丽丝
Give me the sword, Alice!

499
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:57,430
爱丽丝  我不能逼你离开
Alice, I can't make you go.

500
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:58,510
没错
Exactly.

501
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:00,000
不  我说真的  我不能逼你
No, I mean it. I can't make you.

502
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,960
我不能带你走  不能强迫你离开
I can't take you. I can't force you.

503
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,670
因为在这个地方
Because this place--

504
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:05,530
唯一脱身的方法就是自愿离开
the only way out is wanting to go.

505
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:07,800
所以求你了  爱丽丝  跟我走吧
So please, Alice, just come with me.

506
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,380
该死的  爱丽丝  看看你自己
Oh, bloody hell, Alice. Look at ya!

507
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:18,750
跟我走吧
Please just come with me.

508
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,380
不要
No.

509
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,610
我哪都不会去
I'm not going anywhere.

510
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,900
我终于找到家了
I finally found a home.

511
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:01,360
如果我是个受到惊吓的小精灵
Now if I were a frightened little genie...

512
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,730
我会逃去哪呢
which way I would run?

513
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,040
真聪明
Clever.

514
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,210
但还不够
But not clever enough.

515
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,450
她在这里
Ah. There she is.

516
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:52,130
看来她没等我们吃早餐
Looks like she started breakfast without us.

517
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,500
爱丽丝  这就是我跟你说过的那个男孩
Alice. This is the boy I was telling you about--

518
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,040
达西夫人的儿子
Mrs. Darcy's son.

519
00:30:58,050 --> 00:30:59,230
他只是顺便路过
He just stopped by.

520
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,230
我们觉得如果你感觉好些了
We thought he could join us for breakfast...

521
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,620
可以邀他一起吃早餐
if you were feeling better.

522
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:06,110
早上好  爱丽丝  很高兴见到你
Good morning, Alice. Nice to meet you.

523
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,340
是你把他带过来的
You brought him here?

524
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:13,970
你在想什么
And you thought what?

525
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:16,090
你以为这能让情况好转吗
That it would make things better?

526
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,710
帮我忘却往事吗
Help me forget?

527
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,950
你真的一点都不了解我
You really don't know me at all.

528
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,120
你要去哪
Where are you going?

529
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,140
反正不留在这儿
Anywhere else.

530
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,360
但是你无处可去了
But you have nowhere else to go.

531
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,620
你自己不也说过吗
Isn't that what you said?

532
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:45,590
快进去道歉
Go back in and apologize.

533
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:46,500
不可能
I won't.

534
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,730
你娶了一个自己不爱的人
Just because you married someone you don't love

535
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:50,010
不代表我也要这样做
doesn't mean I have to.

536
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:51,190
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

537
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:52,490
她不能让你真的感到幸福
She doesn't make you truly happy.

538
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:53,620
她当然能了
Of course she does.

539
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,070
不能像妈妈那样
Not like mother.

540
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,770
我们不能在哀悼中
We can't... spend our whole life

541
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,110
度过余生  爱丽丝
in mourning, Alice.

542
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,700
你必须得走出阴影
You must find a way to move forward...

543
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:10,470
像我一样
as I did.

544
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,110
你用了好多年才忘掉妈妈
It took you years to get over mother.

545
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:17,950
在我小时候  你一直愁眉不展
You were sad my entire childhood.

546
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:20,070
你为什么觉得我在几天内
Why do you think I can forget Cyrus

547
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,510
就能忘记塞勒斯
in just a few days?

548
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:24,470
因为不像他  你妈妈是真实存在的
Because unlike him, your mother was bloody real!

549
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:26,170
塞勒斯也是
Cyrus was real.

550
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:27,330
不  他不是
No, he's not!

551
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:28,620
你得想办法忘记
You need to find a way to give up

552
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,290
你想象中的爱情故事  爱丽丝
this imaginary love story, Alice,

553
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:32,600
然后开始你自己的生活
and move on with your life.

554
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,070
要是我做不到呢
What if it's not possible?

555
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,470
如果一个人不管多努力
What if a person can't forget their love,

556
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:37,580
都无法忘记她的真爱呢
no matter how much easier it would be?

557
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,740
你必须忘记
You must.

558
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:40,290
我做不到
I can't.

559
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,070
那你就不能和我们一起
Then you can no longer live under our roof

560
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,800
住在这房子里
with our family.

561
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:49,870
这是你说的  还是她
Is that you talking, or her?

562
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:55,760
还有另一个好办法
There's one other.. good option.

563
00:32:57,190 --> 00:33:00,580
伦敦有个医生  叫利德盖特
A doctor in London-- Lydgate.

564
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,450
他开了一家精神疗养院
He runs a psychiatric hospital.

565
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:03,560
疯人院
A madhouse?

566
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,840
那和书上写的不一样
It's not like it is in the books.

567
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,710
那个地方很好  很现代化
This place is very nice, very modern.

568
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:10,700
但是我没疯  你为什么不能相信我
But I'm not mad! Why can't you just believe--

569
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,600
你想让我相信什么
And what part do you want me to believe?

570
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,820
精灵还是会说话的兔子
The genie or the talking rabbit?

571
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:15,560
相信我
Me.

572
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,650
你应该相信我
You should believe in me!

573
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:21,290
对不起
I'm sorry.

574
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,170
我们不能再这样下去了
We can't go on like this.

575
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,070
我必须为米莉着想
I have to think of Millie.

576
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:29,100
你会把我送进疯人院
You'll just send me to a madhouse.

577
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,380
不是把你送去
Not send you.

578
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:32,960
只是给你一个选择
Offer you a choice.

579
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:35,040
你可以让莎拉帮你找个丈夫
You can let Sarah find you a husband,

580
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:36,610
或者是去医院
or you can live in a hospital.

581
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,670
但是你不能留在这
But you can't sit here

582
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:41,610
渴望活在一个虚构的世界里  爱丽丝
pining for a make-believe life, Alice.

583
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,050
爱丽丝  决定权完全在你手上
The choice, Alice... is entirely yours.

584
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,740
没时间了  爱丽丝
Running out of time, Alice.

585
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:58,770
你必须做出选择
You have to make a choice.

586
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,630
别过来
Don't come any closer.

587
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,980
只有你想留下  这个地方才能留住你
This place can only make you stay if you want to.

588
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:07,490
所以我要帮你想起来
So I'm gonna help you remember,

589
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:08,760
就算要以生命为代价
even if it kills me.

590
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:11,970
记得这是谁给你的吗
You know who gave you this?

591
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,330
是塞勒斯
His name was Cyrus.

592
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,580
而你为了找到他  一直在艰苦地战斗
And you've been fighting like hell to get to him.

593
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,920
别说了  我在这里很开心
Stop it. I'm happy here.

594
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,290
你可以杀了我
You can kill me.

595
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:25,470
变成一棵该死的树
Become a bloody tree.

596
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,050
永远待在这里
Stay here forever.

597
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:29,310
但是没有塞勒斯  你是不会真的快乐
But you'll never be truly happy until you're with him.

598
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:34,640
我认识的爱丽丝绝不会在这一点上让步
The Alice I know would never give up on that.

599
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,300
拜托  别说了
Please stop it.

600
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:40,170
不
No.

601
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:02,860
塞勒斯
Cyrus.

602
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:09,090
这是什么东西
What are these?

603
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,680
放开我  让我走
Get off me! Let me go!

604
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,860
就是这样  棒极了  爱丽丝
Yes, that's it. Bloody brilliant, Alice!

605
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,630
我要去找他
I need to find him.

606
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:34,290
小心点  注意脚下
Careful now. Watch your step.

607
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,310
是你
You.

608
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:39,820
没错  就是我
Yes. Me.

609
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,940
是不是似曾相识
Look familiar?

610
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,560
一切都会好起来的  埃德温
It's going to be all right, Edwin.

611
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:29,370
你确定吗
Are you certain?

612
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:31,570
我们都很清楚留她不能留在这里
We both know she couldn't stay here.

613
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:33,280
她在那里会更开心的
She's going to be much happier.

614
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,010
所以你觉得她是做出了正确的选择
So you think she made the right decision?

615
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:37,710
我知道她做对了
I know she did.

616
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,170
我为她的聪明感到惊讶
I was actually surprised at her wisdom.

617
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,780
都会好起来的
It's going to be fine.

618
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:48,250
她不能永远做一个小女孩  埃德温
She can't be a little girl forever, Edwin,

619
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:50,460
而且医生会好好照顾她的
And he'll take excellent care of her.

620
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,400
我也希望如此
I certainly hope so.

621
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,960
她甚至都不想我到医院去看她
She doesn't even want me to visit the hospital, you know.

622
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:36,280
她还太过年轻鲁莽
She's still young and impetuous,

623
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,220
所以这样对她来说才是最好的
which is why this is best.

624
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,270
是时候让她成长起来了
It's time for her to grow up.

625
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,230
妈妈
Mommy?

626
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,100
谢谢
Thank you.

627
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,590
只是想报答你的救命之恩
Just trying to get square for once.

628
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,410
这样我就少欠你一个人情
That's one less I owe ya.

629
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:12,000
我还从没体会过那种感觉
I've never felt anything like that.

630
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:17,000
所有的烦恼  就在一瞬间消失了
All my troubles just-- just lifted away.

631
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:20,550
现在它们一下子又回来了
Now it's all just coming back all at once.

632
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,530
我的心好痛
There's this pain in my heart.

633
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:26,510
你也有这种感觉吗
Do you feel it, too?

634
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,990
一点没有
Nothing like that.

635
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,340
但你会没事的
But you're gonna be fine.

636
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,450
我刚解除石化状态时感觉也很糟
I mean, I felt like hell when I got out of that statue,

637
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:37,070
但瞧瞧我现在  焕如新生
But look at me now. Good as new.

638
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,010
谢谢你
Thank you for that.

639
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:39,630
谢什么
For what?

640
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,660
把我变回来
For turning me back.

641
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:42,980
不是我做的
That wasn't me.

642
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,140
不是你吗  那是谁
Wasn't you? Then who was it?

643
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,580
安娜斯塔西娅拿到了魔尘
Anastasia had a bit of magic dust.

644
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,630
该死的
Bloody hell.

645
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:50,310
什么
What?

646
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:51,570
你想继续当一座石像吗
You want to remain a statue?

647
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:53,130
我不想和她扯上关系
I want nothing to do with her.

648
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,540
她也许还爱着你  威尔
Perhaps she's still in love with you, Will.

649
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:58,770
我已经不再爱她了
Well, not only don't I love her back--

650
00:38:58,770 --> 00:38:59,650
我做不到
I can't.

651
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,680
很早以前我就确认了这一点
I made sure of that a long time ago.

652
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,630
这是什么意思
What does that mean?

653
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,630
跟你的心有关  对不对
It's about your heart, isn't it?

654
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:07,710
你说过有些事你还没告诉我
You said there was something you didn't tell me.

655
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:09,970
威尔  你欠我一个解释
Will? You owe me an explanation.

656
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,260
听着
Look...

657
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:14,440
我知道你历经许多艰险
I know you went to a lot of trouble

658
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,780
才找回我的心
to get my heart back, but...

659
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:19,080
但把我的心放回去并不能改变什么
But that place back there can't possibly affect it.

660
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,650
因为你根本就没有把心放回去
Because you never put it back in.

661
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,730
你都在想些什么啊
What were you thinking?

662
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:30,430
安娜斯塔西娅让我的心碎了
Anastasia broke my heart.

663
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,860
我知道一旦把心放回胸膛
I knew the minute I put it back in me chest,

664
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,070
我就会重新体会到心碎的感觉
I'd feel all that again.

665
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:37,370
你不想去感受
You didn't want to feel?

666
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:38,220
我不想
Not that.

667
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,600
所以我想  为什么不把这苦难留到明天
So I thought, why not put off the misery until tomorrow?

668
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,430
然后是后天  然后是大后天
Then the next tomorrow. Then the next.

669
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:46,490
过了一阵之后  我就有点习惯了
And after a while, I... I kinda got used to it...

670
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,170
那种空荡荡的感觉
the emptiness.

671
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,350
如果你没有把心放回胸膛的话
So if you didn't put your heart back in,

672
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:53,600
你把它藏到哪儿了
where did you put it?

673
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:57,040
晚点再告诉你  先看看这东西
I'll tell you later, because look at that bloody thing.

674
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,790
想要逃回到爱丽丝身边
It was a wonderful fantasy you had--

675
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:11,250
真是异想天开
escaping back to Alice.

676
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:12,960
这绝不只是异想天开
It's much more than a fantasy.

677
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,210
我会再见到她的
I will see her again.

678
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,470
现在你被困在一座漂浮小岛上
You're trapped on a floating island

679
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:19,070
无路可逃
with nowhere to escape.

680
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,740
亲爱的  残酷的现实就是
Darling, the harsh reality is

681
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:23,210
有时候仅仅有爱情是不够的
sometimes love is not enough.

682
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,550
恐怕你错了
I'm afraid you're wrong.

683
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:56,590
有什么事吗
Can I help you?

684
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,270
事实上  我相信我可以帮到你
Actually, I believe I can help you.

685
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:02,820
抱歉  我们认识吗
I'm sorry. Do we know one another?

686
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:05,520
不认识  但我认识你的女儿
No. But I know your daughter,

687
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:08,360
而且我知道她逃出疯人院后
and I know where she went after she escaped

688
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,470
去了什么地方
from that asylum.

689
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:11,660
爱丽丝吗
Alice?

690
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:14,120
你见过爱丽丝
You've seen Alice?

691
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:14,970
是的
Yes.

692
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,340
我还可以带你去见她
And I can take you to her.

693
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:29,780
仙

00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:29,780
