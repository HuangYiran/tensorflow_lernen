11
00:03:43,805 --> 00:03:44,437
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shep said...

12
00:03:45,073 --> 00:03:47,139
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shep said you'd be here at 7:30. What gives, man?

13
00:03:48,176 --> 00:03:50,075
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shep said 8:30.

14
00:03:50,078 --> 00:03:53,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've been sitting here an hour. He's peed three times already.

15
00:03:53,782 --> 00:03:56,783
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sure sorry. Shep told me 8:30.

16
00:03:56,785 --> 00:03:58,785
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was a mix-up, I guess.

17
00:03:58,788 --> 00:03:59,767
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got the car?

18
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:03,691
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yah, you bet. It's out in the lot there, brand-new Ciera.

19
00:04:03,693 --> 00:04:07,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, okay. Well, sit down, then.

20
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:08,881
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm Carl Showalter.

21
00:04:08,883 --> 00:04:10,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is my associate, Gaear Grimsrud.

22
00:04:10,602 --> 00:04:14,704
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yah, how ya doing? So we all set on this thing, then?

23
00:04:14,706 --> 00:04:18,072
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Sure, we're set. Why wouldn't we be? -Yah, I'm sure you are.

24
00:04:18,075 --> 00:04:22,612
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shep vouched for you. I got every confidence in you fellas.

25
00:04:27,152 --> 00:04:30,153
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess that's it, then. Here are the keys.

26
00:04:30,155 --> 00:04:31,671
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, that's not it. Jerry

27
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:35,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Huh? -The new vehicle plus $40,000.

28
00:04:35,294 --> 00:04:41,331
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yah, but the deal was the car first, then the $40,000, like as if it was the ransom.

29
00:04:41,334 --> 00:04:44,236
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I thought Shep told you. -Shep didn't tell us much. Jerry

30
00:04:44,238 --> 00:04:49,387
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Except that you'd be here at 7:30. -Well, that was a mix-up.

31
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:54,412
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Yeah, you already said that. -Yah, but it's not a whole pay-in-advance deal.

32
00:04:54,415 --> 00:04:58,136
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See, I give you a brand-new vehicle in advance...

33
00:04:58,286 --> 00:05:01,519
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry -Okay.

34
00:05:01,523 --> 00:05:03,655
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not gonna sit here and debate.

35
00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:07,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll say this though, what Shep told us didn't make much sense.

36
00:05:07,362 --> 00:05:10,396
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no, it's real sound. It's all worked out.

37
00:05:10,398 --> 00:05:14,444
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You want your own wife kidnapped? -Yah

38
00:05:16,471 --> 00:05:22,541
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My point is, you pay the ransom, what, 80,000 bucks?

39
00:05:22,545 --> 00:05:28,745
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, you give us half the ransom, $40,000. You keep half. It's like robbing Peter to pay Paul. Makes no sense.

40
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:34,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. See, it's not me paying the ransom. The thing is, my wife, she's wealthy.

41
00:05:34,692 --> 00:05:36,713
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Her dad, he's real well-off.

42
00:05:36,715 --> 00:05:39,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I'm in a bit of trouble. -What kind of trouble are you in? Jerry.

43
00:05:39,752 --> 00:05:44,629
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's... I'm not gonna get into... See, I just need the money.

44
00:05:45,826 --> 00:05:49,341
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Now, her dad, he's real well-off. -Why not ask him for the money?

45
00:05:49,343 --> 00:05:53,921
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Or your fucking wife. -Or your wife, Jerry.

46
00:05:53,923 --> 00:05:59,993
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well...it's all part of this. They don't know I need it, see.

47
00:05:59,998 --> 00:06:03,032
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So there. And even if they did, I wouldn't get it.

48
00:06:03,035 --> 00:06:08,094
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-So there's that on top. See, these are personal matters. -Personal matters?

49
00:06:08,096 --> 00:06:10,563
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Personal matters that needn't...

50
00:06:10,565 --> 00:06:14,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, Jerry. You're tasking us to perform this mission...

51
00:06:14,502 --> 00:06:19,226
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but you won't... You won't...

52
00:06:20,242 --> 00:06:23,617
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck it, let's take a look at that Ciera.

53
00:06:25,827 --> 00:06:29,500

63
00:06:50,474 --> 00:06:53,851
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who they playing?

64
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:01,945
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is he staying for supper, then?

65
00:07:01,947 --> 00:07:03,586
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yah, I think so.

66
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,788
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Dad? -What?

67
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:05,772
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you staying for supper?

68
00:07:05,775 --> 00:07:07,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

69
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:16,993
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-May I be excused? -What?

70
00:07:16,996 --> 00:07:19,357
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You done there? -I'm going out.

71
00:07:19,359 --> 00:07:20,537
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are you going?

72
00:07:20,542 --> 00:07:22,474
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just McDonald's.

73
00:07:22,477 --> 00:07:23,442
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Back at 9:30.

74
00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:24,409
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK

75
00:07:24,412 --> 00:07:26,993
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He just ate. He's going to

76
00:07:26,995 --> 00:07:28,714
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}McDonald's instead of finishing here.

77
00:07:28,717 --> 00:07:30,684
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He sees his friends there. It's okay.

78
00:07:30,686 --> 00:07:34,217
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's okay, McDonald's? What do you think they do there?

79
00:07:34,222 --> 00:07:36,255
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They don't drink shakes.

80
00:07:36,257 --> 00:07:39,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's okay, Dad.

81
00:07:44,301 --> 00:07:47,434
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wade, have you had a chance to think about...

82
00:07:47,437 --> 00:07:50,634
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...that deal I talked about? Those 40 acres on Wayzata.

83
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,648
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You told me about it.

84
00:07:51,651 --> 00:07:55,694
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You said you'd think about it. I know it's a lot of money.

85
00:07:55,699 --> 00:07:58,731
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a heck of a lot. What'd you say you'll put there?

86
00:07:58,733 --> 00:08:01,765
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-A lot. It's a limited... -I know it's a lot.

87
00:08:01,768 --> 00:08:03,787
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, a parking lot.

88
00:08:03,792 --> 00:08:06,824
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, $750,000 is a lot.

89
00:08:06,828 --> 00:08:07,924
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yah, it's a chunk, but...

90
00:08:07,926 --> 00:08:11,795
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I had a couple of lots, late '50s, lost a lot of money.

91
00:08:11,797 --> 00:08:14,917
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Yeah, but...  -I thought you were gonna show to Stan Grossman.

92
00:08:14,921 --> 00:08:19,977
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-He passes on this stuff before it gets to me. -Stan'll say no dice. That's why you pay him.

93
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,866
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm asking you. This could work out

94
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:26,717
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}real good for me, Jean and Scotty.

95
00:08:26,723 --> 00:08:29,763
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jean and Scotty never have to worry.

96
00:08:43,966 --> 00:08:47,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where is pancakes house?

97
00:08:47,002 --> 00:08:48,208
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

98
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:51,836
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We stop at pancakes house.

99
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,007
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you nuts? We had pancakes for breakfast.

100
00:08:54,009 --> 00:08:57,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gotta go to a place where I can get a shot, a beer, steak maybe...

101
00:08:57,913 --> 00:09:00,957
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...not more fucking pancakes. Come on.

102
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,889
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, come on, man!

103
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,351
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, here's an idea.

104
00:09:11,062 --> 00:09:14,622
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can stop at Brainerd. I know a place there we can get laid.

105
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,735
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm fucking hungry now, you know.

106
00:09:16,737 --> 00:09:21,638
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, Jesus. I'm saying, we can stop, get pancakes, and then we'll get laid.

107
00:09:35,689 --> 00:09:38,555
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We sat right here in this room and went over this.

108
00:09:38,725 --> 00:09:39,782
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yah, but that TruCoat...

109
00:09:39,961 --> 00:09:42,724
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I sat here and said I didn't want any TruCoat.

110
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:46,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yah, but that TruCoat, you don't get it, you get oxidation problems.

111
00:09:46,834 --> 00:09:48,528
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It'll cost you more than $500.

112
00:09:48,736 --> 00:09:52,865
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're sitting there, talking in circles, like we didn't go over this.

113
00:09:53,074 --> 00:09:54,062
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But this TruCoat...

114
00:09:54,242 --> 00:10:01,645
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We had a deal for $19,500. You sat there and said you'd get me this car without the sealant for $19,500.

115
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,214
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not saying I didn't.

116
00:10:03,385 --> 00:10:08,321
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You called me and said you had it ready for delivery, come and get it.

117
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:12,756
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And here you are, wasting my time and my wife's time.

118
00:10:12,962 --> 00:10:15,156
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm paying $19,500 for this vehicle.

119
00:10:16,466 --> 00:10:20,333
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, I'll talk to my boss.

120
00:10:23,574 --> 00:10:27,669
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See, they install that TruCoat at the factory. There's nothing we can do.

121
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:29,436
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll talk to my boss.

122
00:10:30,282 --> 00:10:33,375
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These guys here, these guys.

123
00:10:33,985 --> 00:10:36,851
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's always the same. It's always more.

124
00:10:41,027 --> 00:10:43,995
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You going to the Gophers on Sunday? -You betcha.

125
00:10:44,197 --> 00:10:46,164
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wouldn't have an extra ticket?

126
00:10:47,567 --> 00:10:48,999
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You kidding?

127
00:10:54,875 --> 00:11:02,542
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He never done this before, but seeing as it's special circumstances he says I can knock $100 off that TruCoat.

128
00:11:04,136 --> 00:11:06,139
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One hundred?

129
00:11:06,141 --> 00:11:08,554
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You lied to me, Mr. Lundegaard. You're a bald-faced liar.

130
00:11:08,556 --> 00:11:13,158
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bucky, please.

131
00:11:13,162 --> 00:11:15,166
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fucking liar.

132
00:11:15,168 --> 00:11:17,497
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bucky, please.

133
00:11:17,499 --> 00:11:21,182
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's my goddamn checkbook? Let's get this over with.

134
00:11:22,187 --> 00:11:24,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where?

135
00:12:04,551 --> 00:12:08,318
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm talking about your potential.

136
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:11,327
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not a C student.

137
00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:12,524
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah

138
00:12:12,526 --> 00:12:14,335
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yet you're getting C grades.

139
00:12:14,337 --> 00:12:18,523
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's that disparity there that concerns your dad and me.

140
00:12:19,352 --> 00:12:21,358
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what a disparity is?

141
00:12:21,361 --> 00:12:22,361
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yah!

174
00:13:51,619 --> 00:13:54,625

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See, this deal I needed them for I may not need it anymore. Something's happening.

00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,773
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and you can't say one thing in the way of conversation?

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good, Mr. Lundegaard. You're hard to get on the phone.

206
00:16:11,153 --> 00:16:14,386
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's darn busy here, but that's the way we like it.

207
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,922
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, that's for sure.

208
00:16:15,925 --> 00:16:21,763
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just need, on these last financing documents you sent us I can't read the serial numbers.

209
00:16:21,766 --> 00:16:26,834
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yah, but I already got the... The loans are in place. I got...

211
00:16:30,874 --> 00:16:35,345
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But the vehicles you're borrowing on, I can't read the serial numbers...

212
00:16:35,347 --> 00:16:39,714
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-...on your application. If you could... -But the deal's done. I got the money.

213
00:16:39,717 --> 00:16:43,969
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But we have an audit. I have to know these vehicles you're financing...

214
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:48,223
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-...that they really exist. -They exist all right.

215
00:16:48,227 --> 00:16:53,263
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sure, but I can't read the serial numbers. If you could read...

216
00:16:53,266 --> 00:16:59,669
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yah, but... See, I don't have them in front of me. Why don't I fax you a copy?

217
00:16:59,672 --> 00:17:03,442
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, fax is no good. That's what I have, and I can't read it.

218
00:17:03,444 --> 00:17:06,411
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yah, okay, I'll have my girl send you a copy, then.

00:17:06,412 --> 00:17:11,548
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I can't correlate this note with the vehicles, I gotta call back that money.

220
00:17:11,552 --> 00:17:15,866
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-How much money was that? -$320,000.

221
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,023
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've gotta correlate that money with the cars it's lent on.

222
00:17:18,026 --> 00:17:19,937
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No problem, I'll fax that over.

223

232
00:20:25,898 --> 00:20:28,888
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If these numbers are right, this looks sweet.

233
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:32,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Those numbers are right, believe me. -This is doable.

234
00:20:32,882 --> 00:20:35,872
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Congratulations, Jer. -Yah, thanks Stan. It's a pretty...

236
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:42,857
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The financials are thorough, so...

237
00:20:42,858 --> 00:20:45,848
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...the thing we don't know is your fee.

238
00:20:45,852 --> 00:20:49,841
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My fee? Wade, what the heck are you talking about?

239
00:20:49,843 --> 00:20:52,833
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Stan and I are okay. -Yah?

240
00:20:52,838 --> 00:20:54,831
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-We're good to load in. -Yah.

241
00:20:54,832 --> 00:20:58,737
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But we never talked about your fee for bringing it to us.

242
00:20:58,781 --> 00:21:02,811
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I was bringing you this deal to loan me the money to put in.

243
00:21:02,815 --> 00:21:05,805
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's my deal here, see.

244
00:21:05,809 --> 00:21:09,797
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jerry, We thought you brought us a deal.

245
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:10,794
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yah, right.

246
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:13,788
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're saying... What are you saying?

247
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:16,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're saying, we put in the money, you collect when it pays off.

248
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:27,226
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no! I'd pay you back the principal and interest. Heck, I'd go one over prime?

249
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:28,529
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're not a bank, Jerry.

250
00:21:28,532 --> 00:21:33,662
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I wanted a bank interest on $750,000. I'd go to Midwest Federal, talk to Bill Diehl.

251

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-He's at Norstar. -He's at...

00:21:35,902 --> 00:21:40,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, but see, I don't need a finder's fee. I need...

253
00:21:40,112 --> 00:21:43,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Finder's fee's what, 10 percent?

254
00:21:43,853 --> 00:21:46,831
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not gonna do it for me. I need the principal.

255
00:21:46,836 --> 00:21:49,814
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jerry, we're not gonna just give you $750,000.

256
00:21:49,816 --> 00:21:51,801
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the heck were you thinking?

257
00:21:51,805 --> 00:21:54,191
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I'm only getting bank interest, I want security.

258
00:21:54,193 --> 00:21:56,771
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Heck, FDIC. I don't see nothing like that here.

259
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:58,758
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, but I...

260

261
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:08,974
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not talking about your damn word, Jerry. What the heck?

262
00:22:08,976 --> 00:22:11,676
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're not a bank. Jerry

263
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:16,613

264
00:22:16,618 --> 00:22:21,484
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I assume, if you're not interested, you won't mind if we move on it.

265
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:24,301
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Independently.

266
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:25,429

269
00:24:38,106 --> 00:24:39,129
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yah, Wade...

270

272
00:24:47,683 --> 00:24:50,173

273
00:24:50,352 --> 00:24:53,047
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know what to do. It's Jean.

274
00:24:54,857 --> 00:24:58,792
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yah, Wade, I... It's Jerry, I...

275
00:25:00,263 --> 00:25:02,856
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wade, it's Jerry. We gotta talk.

276
00:25:03,033 --> 00:25:06,763
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's something hor... Jeez, it's terrible.

277
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:18,807
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yah, Wade Gustafson, please.

278
00:25:54,356 --> 00:25:58,724
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shut the fuck up, or I'll throw you back into the trunk, you know.

279
00:25:59,395 --> 00:26:01,521
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's more than I've heard you say all week.

280
00:26:09,705 --> 00:26:11,569
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah, shit!

281
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:16,206
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, the tags.

282
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:25,948
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, it's just the tags. I never put my tags on the car.

283
00:26:27,893 --> 00:26:30,292
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry, I'll take care of this.

284
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:56,250

285
00:26:56,423 --> 00:27:00,188
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...or else we're gonna have to, you know, shoot you.

286
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:10,296
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, I'll take care of this.

287
00:27:33,363 --> 00:27:35,262
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How can I help you, officer?

288
00:27:45,277 --> 00:27:46,675
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This a new car, then, sir?

289
00:27:46,879 --> 00:27:50,837
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It certainly is, officer. Still got that smell.

290
00:27:51,183 --> 00:27:56,127
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're required to display tags, either in the plate area or taped to the back window.

291
00:27:56,129 --> 00:27:57,149
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Certainly.

292
00:27:57,356 --> 00:28:00,984

293
00:28:04,331 --> 00:28:07,424
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I was gonna tape up the tag.

294
00:28:10,504 --> 00:28:14,166
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, to be in full compliance but it must have slipped my mind.

295
00:28:15,576 --> 00:28:18,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe the best thing would be to take care of it here.

296
00:28:21,148 --> 00:28:22,546
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's this, sir?

297
00:28:23,251 --> 00:28:26,014

00:28:26,488 --> 00:28:28,682
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want to be in compliance.

299
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:35,594
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was thinking, we could take care of it right here in Brainerd.

300
00:28:40,803 --> 00:28:43,896
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Put that back in your pocket, please.

301
00:28:44,074 --> 00:28:46,735
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And step out of the car, please, sir.

302
00:29:10,637 --> 00:29:12,866
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shut the fuck up!

303
00:29:29,991 --> 00:29:31,652
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa.

304
00:29:32,895 --> 00:29:34,919
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa, daddy.

305
00:29:36,965 --> 00:29:39,398
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll take care of it.

306
00:29:43,206 --> 00:29:46,231
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are smooth-smooth, you know.

307
00:29:47,343 --> 00:29:49,139
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, daddy.

308
00:29:50,979 --> 00:29:53,003
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just clear him off the road.

309
00:29:53,949 --> 00:29:55,347
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

310
00:30:41,925 --> 00:30:43,921
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Shit.

311
00:31:48,895 --> 00:31:50,891
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

312
00:33:46,837 --> 00:33:48,599
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, jeez.

313
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:55,852
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi, it's Marge.

314
00:33:57,858 --> 00:33:59,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my. Where?

315
00:33:59,863 --> 00:34:01,865
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

316
00:34:02,321 --> 00:34:04,871
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, jeez.

317
00:34:05,875 --> 00:34:08,259
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, there in a jiff.

318
00:34:08,261 --> 00:34:10,883
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Real good, then.

319
00:34:15,702 --> 00:34:17,897
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, heck.

320
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:21,067
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can sleep. It's early yet.

321
00:34:21,241 --> 00:34:23,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Gotta go? -Yeah.

322
00:34:23,912 --> 00:34:26,916
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll fix you some eggs.

323
00:34:26,918 --> 00:34:28,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's okay, hon. I gotta run.

324
00:34:28,923 --> 00:34:31,927
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You gotta eat a breakfast, Marge.

325
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:35,934
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll fix you some eggs.

326
00:34:35,936 --> 00:34:38,387
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hon, you can sleep.

327
00:34:38,942 --> 00:34:41,946
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You gotta eat a breakfast.

328
00:34:43,952 --> 00:34:46,956
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll fix you some eggs.

329
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:48,961
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah, Norm.

330
00:34:54,976 --> 00:34:57,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks, hon. Time to shove off.

331
00:34:57,982 --> 00:34:58,975
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Love ya, Margie.

332
00:34:58,977 --> 00:35:01,961
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Love ya, hon.

333
00:35:33,822 --> 00:35:35,198
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hon?

334
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:35,722
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yah?

335
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:38,324
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Prowler needs a jump.

336
00:35:57,313 --> 00:35:58,962
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi, Lou.

337
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:02,518
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What you got there?

338
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:05,488
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Margie. Thought you might need a little warm-up.

339
00:36:05,489 --> 00:36:07,319
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks a bunch.

340
00:36:07,325 --> 00:36:09,079
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's the deal, now?

341
00:36:09,081 --> 00:36:09,957
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gary says triple homicide?

342
00:36:09,961 --> 00:36:12,487
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yah, looks pretty bad. Two of them are over here.

343
00:36:13,331 --> 00:36:15,064
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where is everybody?

344
00:36:15,066 --> 00:36:20,164
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, it's cold, Margie.

345
00:36:20,171 --> 00:36:23,105
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Watch your step, Margie.

346
00:36:31,918 --> 00:36:36,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah, jeez. Ah, jeez!

347
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:39,422
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here's the second one.

348
00:36:39,426 --> 00:36:42,551
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's in the head and the hand there.

349
00:36:43,598 --> 00:36:46,178
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess that's a defensive wound.

350
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,898
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yah?

351
00:36:47,903 --> 00:36:50,065
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's the state trooper?

352
00:36:50,071 --> 00:36:52,137
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Back there a good piece. In the ditch next to his Prowler.

353
00:36:54,209 --> 00:36:58,909
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. So we got a trooper pulls someone over...

354
00:36:58,914 --> 00:37:01,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...we got a shooting, these folks drive by...

355
00:37:02,117 --> 00:37:04,718
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...there's a high-speed pursuit, ends here and then this execution-type deal.

356
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,178
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yah.

357
00:37:09,593 --> 00:37:12,426
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd be very surprised if our suspect was from Brainerd.

358
00:37:12,629 --> 00:37:13,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yah.

359
00:37:15,365 --> 00:37:20,064
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I'll tell you what, from his footprint, he looks like a big fella.

360
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:26,332
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see something down there, chief?

361
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:29,377
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I just think I'm gonna barf!

362
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jeez.

363
00:37:31,883 --> 00:37:34,784
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You okay, Margie? -Yah, I'm fine.

364
00:37:37,155 --> 00:37:39,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just morning sickness.

365
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:43,151
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, that passed.

366
00:37:43,363 --> 00:37:44,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yah?

367
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,457
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yah, now I'm hungry again.

368
00:37:46,833 --> 00:37:48,892
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You had breakfast yet, Margie?

369
00:37:49,102 --> 00:37:53,937
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Oh, yah. Norm made some eggs. -Yah?

370
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,437
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well...

371
00:37:56,544 --> 00:38:00,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-what now, do you think? -Let's go take a look at that trooper.

372
00:38:04,086 --> 00:38:06,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's different footprints here, Lou.

373
00:38:06,221 --> 00:38:07,308
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yah?

374
00:38:07,311 --> 00:38:09,247
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This guy's smaller than his buddy.

375
00:38:09,458 --> 00:38:11,119
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yah?

376
00:38:11,327 --> 00:38:13,124
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For Pete's sake.

377
00:38:13,329 --> 00:38:14,762
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How's it look, Marge?

378
00:38:14,931 --> 00:38:20,728
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, he's got his gun on his hip there and he looks like a nice enough guy.

379
00:38:20,937 --> 00:38:24,395
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-It's a real shame. -Yah.

380
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:29,836
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Did you monkey with his car, there? -No way.

381
00:38:30,047 --> 00:38:31,412
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Somebody shut his lights.

382
00:38:31,615 --> 00:38:34,311
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess the little guy waited for his buddy.

383
00:38:34,518 --> 00:38:36,042
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It would've been cold out here.

384
00:38:36,253 --> 00:38:38,949
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Heck, yah. You think is Dave open yet?

385
00:38:39,123 --> 00:38:42,918
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dave? You don't think he's mixed up in?

386
00:38:43,128 --> 00:38:46,256
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no, no. I just want to get Norm some night crawlers.

387
00:38:49,068 --> 00:38:50,865
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you look in his citation book?

388
00:38:51,103 --> 00:38:55,258
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yah, last vehicle he wrote in was a tan Ciera

389
00:38:55,262 --> 00:38:58,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}at 2:18 a.m. Under plate number, he put DLR.

390
00:38:58,611 --> 00:39:03,014
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I figure they stopped him or shot him before he filled out the tag number.

391
00:39:03,617 --> 00:39:07,018
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I got the state looking for a Ciera with a tag starting DLR.

392
00:39:07,187 --> 00:39:08,882
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They don't got no match yet.

393
00:39:10,157 --> 00:39:14,218
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not sure that I agree with you 100% on your police work there, Lou.

394
00:39:14,428 --> 00:39:15,238
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Yah? -Yah.

395
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:20,061
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think that vehicle there probably had dealer plates.

396
00:39:20,268 --> 00:39:21,599
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}DLR?\nDLR?

397
00:39:26,809 --> 00:39:28,174
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jeez.

398
00:39:29,546 --> 00:39:34,943
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Say, Lou hear the one about the guy who couldn't afford personalized plates...

399
00:39:35,151 --> 00:39:37,483
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...so he went and changed his name to J3L 2404?

400
00:39:38,221 --> 00:39:40,416
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yah, that's a good one.

401
00:39:47,532 --> 00:39:51,332
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, all I know is, you got a problem, you call a professional.

402
00:39:51,503 --> 00:39:54,961
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. They said, "No cops." They were darn clear on that, Wade.

403
00:39:55,173 --> 00:39:57,266
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They said, "Call your cops, and we'll shoo..."

404
00:39:57,476 --> 00:40:00,639
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course they'll say that. Protection? They've got Jean.

405
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:05,253
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I give them a million dollars, where's my guarantee they'll let her go?

406
00:40:05,257 --> 00:40:07,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Well, they... -A million dollars is a lot of damn money.

407
00:40:07,503 --> 00:40:09,403
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-They got my daughter. -Think this through, Wade.

408
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:13,209
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You give them what they want, why won't they let her go?

409
00:40:13,213 --> 00:40:16,127
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got to listen to me on this one, Wade.

410
00:40:16,129 --> 00:40:20,217
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Heck, you don't know. You're just whistling Dixie here.

411
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:24,225
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm saying, the cops, they can advise us on this. I'm saying, call a professional.

412
00:40:24,227 --> 00:40:27,673
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. No cops. That's final.

413
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:30,232
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is my deal here, Wade.

414
00:40:30,234 --> 00:40:32,233
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jean is my wife, here.

415
00:40:32,236 --> 00:40:35,236
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I gotta tell you, Wade, I'm leaning to Jerry's viewpoint here.

416
00:40:36,242 --> 00:40:37,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What

417
00:40:37,242 --> 00:40:38,684
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We gotta protect Jean.

418
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:43,247
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're not holding any cards. They got them all, so they call the shots.

419
00:40:43,249 --> 00:40:46,249
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm telling ya.

420
00:40:46,254 --> 00:40:48,253
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, why don't we?

421
00:40:48,257 --> 00:40:52,258
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm thinking we should offer them half a million.

422
00:40:52,263 --> 00:40:56,264
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, come on, here! No way, Wade. No way.

423
00:40:56,268 --> 00:40:58,267
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-We're not horse-trading here, Wade. -Yah.

424
00:40:58,271 --> 00:41:03,273
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-We gotta bite the bullet on this. -Yah.

425
00:41:03,277 --> 00:41:06,214
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, what's the next step here, Jerry?

426
00:41:06,216 --> 00:41:10,621
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They'll call with instructions for a drop. I'm to have the money tomorrow.

427
00:41:10,625 --> 00:41:13,181
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Damn it!

428
00:41:14,464 --> 00:41:16,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How was everything today?

429
00:41:16,464 --> 00:41:19,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yah, real good, now.

430

00:41:22,463 --> 00:41:25,459
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, now, we'll get the money.

432
00:41:25,461 --> 00:41:27,457
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry about it, Jerry.

433
00:41:27,461 --> 00:41:31,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you want anyone at home with you till they call?

434
00:41:31,465 --> 00:41:36,202
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, they don't want They're supposed to deal with me. They're real clear.

435
00:41:36,204 --> 00:41:40,303
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They said no one listening in. They'll be watching, you know?

436
00:41:40,309 --> 00:41:44,414
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe it's all bull, but like you said, they're calling the shots.

437
00:41:44,416 --> 00:41:49,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Now, is Scotty gonna be all right?

00:46:29,563 --> 00:46:33,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I couldn't really say. He wasn't circumcised.

502
00:46:33,473 --> 00:46:36,403
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Was he funny-Iooking apart from that?

506
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:48,648
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Like I say, he was funny-Iooking.

507
00:46:48,651 --> 00:46:50,660

508
00:46:50,662 --> 00:46:51,926
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The other fella?

509
00:46:51,928 --> 00:46:55,095
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-He was a little older. He looked like the Marlboro Man. -Oh, yah?

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But maybe I'm saying that because he smoked a lot of Marlboros.

512
00:47:01,070 --> 00:47:04,639
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Like a subconscious type of thing. -Oh, yah. That can happen.

607

609
00:53:51,553 --> 00:53:54,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shep Proudfoot. That's a name.

610
00:53:56,657 --> 00:53:59,507
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

00:53:59,509 --> 00:54:04,262
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Yah, I think I'll take a drive down there, then. -Oh, yah? Twin Cities?

614
00:54:24,491 --> 00:54:28,499
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, Wade. They were real clear. They'll call with instructions,

615
00:54:28,501 --> 00:54:34,595
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-and it's to be delivered by me alone. -It's my money. I'll deliver it. What do they care?

616
00:54:34,765 --> 00:54:37,766
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wade's got a point. I'll handle the call, Jerry.

617
00:54:37,768 --> 00:54:41,531
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no. See, they only deal with me.

00:54:48,552 --> 00:54:50,553

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't want you mucking this up.

623
00:54:53,564 --> 00:54:54,563
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you mean?

624
00:54:54,566 --> 00:54:56,567

00:54:56,572 --> 00:54:57,571
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or I'll go to a professional.

00:55:01,583 --> 00:55:03,584

630
00:55:03,589 --> 00:55:07,596
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's my show here. That's that.

647
00:55:59,756 --> 00:56:06,895
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks a bunch. Oh, say. Would you know a good place for lunch in the downtown area?

00:57:31,237 --> 00:57:34,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I decided not to park here.

652
00:57:34,264 --> 00:57:36,278
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you mean? You decided not to park here?

653
00:57:36,283 --> 00:57:39,306
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just came in and decided not to park here.

654
00:57:39,308 --> 00:57:42,331
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, well, I'm sorry, sir...

656
00:57:45,239 --> 00:57:48,385
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I decided not to take the trip, so...

657
00:57:48,388 --> 00:57:52,947
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I'm sorry, sir. We still gotta charge you $4.

658
00:57:53,849 --> 00:57:56,456
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just pulled in here. I just fucking pulled in here.

659
00:57:56,458 --> 00:58:00,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, but see, there's a minimum charge of $4.

660
00:58:00,492 --> 00:58:04,524
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Long-term parking charges by the day.

661
00:58:07,556 --> 00:58:11,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess you think you're like an authority figure?

662

665

670
00:58:30,943 --> 00:58:35,185
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Said she was a cop!

671
00:58:35,189 --> 00:58:38,022
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you remember getting a call Wednesday night?

672
00:58:38,025 --> 00:58:39,491
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nope.

673

674
00:58:42,763 --> 00:58:43,927
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yep.

675
00:58:43,931 --> 00:58:46,086

676
00:58:46,088 --> 00:58:47,164
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

677

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, Mr. Proudfoot,

678
00:58:48,211 --> 00:58:51,337
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}this call came in past 3 in the morning.

679
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:54,994
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's hard to believe you don't remember anyone calling.

680
00:58:55,912 --> 00:58:58,346
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know you've had some problems...

681
00:58:58,348 --> 00:59:03,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...struggling with the narcotics, some other entanglements currently on parole.

682
00:59:03,953 --> 00:59:04,818
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So?

683
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:10,688
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, associating with criminals if you're the one they talked to, that is a violation of your parole.

684
00:59:10,895 --> 00:59:13,962
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It would end you up back in Stillwater.

685
00:59:13,965 --> 00:59:17,797
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've got some priors, but nothing in the nature of a homicide.

686
00:59:17,802 --> 00:59:21,536
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't want to be an accessory to something like that.

687
00:59:23,408 --> 00:59:27,676
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you think you remember who those folks were who called ya?

688

690
00:59:38,758 --> 00:59:40,724
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Could I take a minute here?

691
00:59:40,726 --> 00:59:43,292
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? What is it all about?

692
00:59:43,296 --> 00:59:46,337
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mind if I sit? I'm carrying quite a load here.

693

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're the owner, Mr. Lundegaard?

694
00:59:48,372 --> 00:59:50,399
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, executive sales manager.

695
00:59:50,404 --> 00:59:51,293
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can help me.

696
00:59:51,295 --> 00:59:53,076
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm Marge Gun...

697
00:59:53,079 --> 00:59:55,751

698
00:59:55,755 --> 00:59:59,044
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm a police officer from up Brainerd,

699

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}investigating some malfeasance.

700
01:00:00,382 --> 01:00:03,433
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have you had any vehicles stolen off

01:03:17,321 --> 01:03:20,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, so I don't have to turn my neck.

758

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no. That's fine.

761

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, sorry.

762
01:03:34,277 --> 01:03:37,266
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I was married to Linda Cooksey.

763
01:03:37,270 --> 01:03:39,263
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember, she was a year behind us?

764
01:03:39,264 --> 01:03:43,451
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I think I remember her. Oh, yah.

765
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:46,243
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So it didn't work out?

766
01:03:46,245 --> 01:03:49,234
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've been working for Honeywell for a few years.

767
01:03:49,237 --> 01:03:51,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're a good outfit.

768
01:03:51,232 --> 01:03:54,221
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yah, if you're an engineer, you could do a lot worse.

769
01:03:54,225 --> 01:03:57,214
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But it's nothing like your achievement.

770
01:03:58,215 --> 01:04:01,204
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It sounds like you're doing super.

771
01:04:01,207 --> 01:04:04,196
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not that... It's not that things didn't work out...

772
01:04:06,194 --> 01:04:07,189
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's...

773
01:04:07,191 --> 01:04:10,959
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Linda had leukemia, you know.

774
01:04:11,181 --> 01:04:14,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She passed away.

775
01:04:14,173 --> 01:04:17,162
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

776
01:04:17,166 --> 01:04:20,155
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was tough.

777
01:04:20,157 --> 01:04:25,146
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was long. She fought real hard, Marge.

778
01:04:29,135 --> 01:04:32,124
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, what can you say?

779
01:04:34,122 --> 01:04:36,115
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Better times, huh?

780
01:04:36,116 --> 01:04:39,105
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Better times.

781
01:04:40,105 --> 01:04:44,092
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then I saw you on the TV, and I remembered, you know.

782
01:04:45,092 --> 01:04:46,087
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I always liked you.

783
01:04:46,091 --> 01:04:47,065
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I always liked you...

784
01:04:47,067 --> 01:04:53,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I always liked you so much!

785
01:04:54,071 --> 01:04:57,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Should we get together another time?

786
01:04:57,063 --> 01:05:00,052
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! I...

787
01:05:02,049 --> 01:05:05,568
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, you know...

788
01:05:05,570 --> 01:05:09,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I shouldn't have done this. I shouldn't have done this.

789
01:05:09,032 --> 01:05:11,025
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought we'd have a terrific time.

790
01:05:11,026 --> 01:05:13,019
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's okay, Mike.

791
01:05:13,022 --> 01:05:16,011
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were such a super lady!

792
01:05:16,014 --> 01:05:19,283
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've been so Ionely.

793
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,997
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's okay, Mike.

794

796
01:05:52,985 --> 01:05:55,384
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just in town on business.

797
01:05:55,386 --> 01:05:59,155
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just in and out.

798
01:05:59,157 --> 01:06:02,824
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just a little of the old "in and out."

799
01:06:02,826 --> 01:06:04,925
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you do?

800

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}before with other clients?

803
01:06:14,866 --> 01:06:16,751
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think so.

804
01:06:16,754 --> 01:06:18,639

01:14:12,662 --> 01:14:15,095
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and this little guy's drinking and he says,

891
01:14:15,097 --> 01:14:16,718
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Where's the action?

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going crazy at the lake."

893
01:14:19,124 --> 01:14:21,006
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I say, "What kind of action?"

894
01:14:21,010 --> 01:14:22,892
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He says, "Women. What do I look like?"

895
01:14:22,894 --> 01:14:26,594
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I said, "I don't arrange that kind of thing."

896
01:14:26,598 --> 01:14:29,399
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And he says, "But I'm going crazy."

897
01:14:29,401 --> 01:14:32,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I said, "This ain't the place." .

898
01:14:32,504 --> 01:14:34,683
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He says, "I get it. You think I'm a jerk for asking."

899
01:14:36,140 --> 01:14:37,821
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Only he don't use the word "jerk."

900
01:14:37,823 --> 01:14:39,504
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So he calls me a jerk...

901
01:14:39,509 --> 01:14:43,742
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and says the last guy who thought he was a jerk is dead now.

902
01:14:43,745 --> 01:14:45,611
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He says, "What do you think?"

903
01:14:45,613 --> 01:14:49,047
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I said, "That don't sound too good for him, then."

904

01:14:50,651 --> 01:14:53,818

906
01:14:53,822 --> 01:14:57,288
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then he says, "Jeez, I'm going crazy out at the lake."

907
01:14:57,291 --> 01:14:58,522
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}White Bear Lake?

908
01:14:58,526 --> 01:15:01,497
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The bar's closer to Moose Lake, so I made that assumption.

909
01:15:02,062 --> 01:15:04,696
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anyway, he's drinking at the bar...

910
01:15:04,698 --> 01:15:06,763
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...so I don't think much of it.

911
01:15:06,765 --> 01:15:09,892
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But then Mrs. Mohra heard about the homicides...

912
01:15:10,421 --> 01:15:12,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and thought I should call it in,

913
01:15:12,403 --> 01:15:15,374
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so I called it in.

914
01:15:16,368 --> 01:15:18,347
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}End of story.

915
01:15:18,350 --> 01:15:20,329
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did this guy look like?

916
01:15:20,333 --> 01:15:23,304
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's a little guy, kind of funny-Iooking.

917
01:15:24,298 --> 01:15:26,277
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In what way?

918
01:15:26,282 --> 01:15:28,261
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, just in a general kind of way.

919
01:15:28,264 --> 01:15:29,018
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Thanks, Mr. Mohra.

920
01:15:29,020 --> 01:15:32,227
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're right, it's probably nothing.

921
01:15:32,229 --> 01:15:34,208
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-But thanks for calling her in. -Sure.

922
01:15:34,212 --> 01:15:37,658
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Looks like she's gonna turn cold tomorrow.

923
01:15:37,660 --> 01:15:40,156
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah. We got a front coming in.

924
01:15:40,161 --> 01:15:44,238
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, you got that right.

925
01:16:01,581 --> 01:16:04,557
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jesus Christ.

926
01:18:19,601 --> 01:18:21,766
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Valerie, I'm leaving this morning...

927
01:18:21,768 --> 01:18:25,532
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...back up to Brainerd. -I'm sorry I won't see ya.

928
01:18:25,539 --> 01:18:27,537
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think he's all right?

929
01:18:27,542 --> 01:18:28,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I saw him last night.

930
01:18:28,542 --> 01:18:30,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did he say?

931
01:18:30,543 --> 01:18:31,541
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's nothing specific he said.

932
01:18:31,545 --> 01:18:34,545
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It just seemed like it hit him really hard, his wife dying.

933
01:18:34,547 --> 01:18:35,556
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His wife?

934
01:18:35,559 --> 01:18:36,568
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Linda.

935
01:18:36,571 --> 01:18:37,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who?

936
01:18:37,583 --> 01:18:38,592
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Linda Cooksey.

937
01:18:38,596 --> 01:18:41,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, they weren't...

938
01:18:41,633 --> 01:18:43,653
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was bothering her for a year.

939
01:18:43,658 --> 01:18:46,692
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pestering her, wouldn't leave her alone.

940
01:18:46,694 --> 01:18:49,728
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He didn't?

941
01:18:50,743 --> 01:18:51,752
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They never?

942
01:18:51,755 --> 01:18:53,775
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. They never married.

943
01:18:53,781 --> 01:18:55,801
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mike's had psychiatric problems.

944
01:18:55,805 --> 01:18:56,814
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my.

945
01:18:56,819 --> 01:18:58,841
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's been struggling.

946
01:18:58,843 --> 01:19:01,877
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's living with his parents now.

947
01:19:01,881 --> 01:19:03,901
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, jeez.

948
01:19:03,905 --> 01:19:05,937
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Linda's fine. You should call her.

949
01:19:05,942 --> 01:19:08,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jeez, well...

950
01:19:08,842 --> 01:19:10,035
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jeez.

951
01:19:11,032 --> 01:19:14,084
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a surprise.

952
01:19:23,255 --> 01:19:25,252
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello!

953
01:20:05,292 --> 01:20:06,295
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Lundegaard,

954
01:20:06,296 --> 01:20:08,304
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}sorry to bother you. Can I come in?

955
01:20:08,309 --> 01:20:09,312
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, no.

956
01:20:09,316 --> 01:20:11,324
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm kind of busy here.

957
01:20:11,328 --> 01:20:14,344
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll keep it real short, then.

958
01:20:14,348 --> 01:20:19,378
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm on my way out of town, but I was wondering Mind if I sit? I'm carrying a bit of a load.

959
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:20,383
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

960
01:20:20,386 --> 01:20:24,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-It's about the vehicle. -I was wondering...Like I said no vehicles are missing.

961
01:20:24,942 --> 01:20:32,457
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Are you sure? Because, I mean, how do you know?

962
01:20:32,459 --> 01:20:34,467
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The crime's perpetrators were

963
01:20:34,471 --> 01:20:38,492
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}driving a car with dealer plates. And they called here.

964
01:20:38,496 --> 01:20:42,517
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It would be quite a coincidence if they weren't, you know, connected.

965
01:20:42,522 --> 01:20:43,525
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yah, I see.

966
01:20:43,528 --> 01:20:44,991
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So how do you?

967
01:20:44,993 --> 01:20:47,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have you done any inventory recently?

968
01:20:47,552 --> 01:20:48,995
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Car's not from our lot, ma'am.

969
01:20:48,997 --> 01:20:51,572
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do you know that for sure?

970
01:20:51,578 --> 01:20:54,594
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I would know. I'm the executive sales manager.

971
01:20:54,596 --> 01:20:56,604
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I understand, but...

972
01:20:56,608 --> 01:20:58,619
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We run a pretty tight ship.

973
01:20:58,621 --> 01:21:01,637
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, but how do they establish that, sir?

974
01:21:01,639 --> 01:21:04,655
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are the cars counted daily or what kind of a routine?

975
01:21:04,659 --> 01:21:08,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ma'am, I answered your question.

976
01:21:11,702 --> 01:21:12,705
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, sir?

977
01:21:12,707 --> 01:21:15,723
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ma'am, I answered your question.

978
01:21:15,727 --> 01:21:18,287
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I answered the darn... I'm cooperating here.

979
01:21:18,289 --> 01:21:22,768
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And there's no, uh...

980
01:21:23,527 --> 01:21:28,807
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sir, you have no call to get snippy with me. I'm just doing my job here.

981
01:21:28,809 --> 01:21:32,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not...

982
01:21:32,835 --> 01:21:36,236
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not arguing here. I'm cooperating.

983
01:21:36,238 --> 01:21:40,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're doing all we can.

984
01:21:45,915 --> 01:21:49,841
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sir, could I talk to Mr. Gustafson?

985
01:21:52,793 --> 01:21:55,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Lundegaard.

986
01:21:57,375 --> 01:22:03,581
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, heck! If you want to play games here I'm working with ya on this thing!

987
01:22:03,587 --> 01:22:04,894
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay! I'll do a damn lot count!

988
01:22:04,896 --> 01:22:07,535
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right now?

989
01:22:07,538 --> 01:22:15,835
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, right now. You're darn tootin'. It's so damned important to ya!

990
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:19,667
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I'm sorry, sir. -Ah, what the Christ!

991
01:23:04,882 --> 01:23:06,143
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, for Pete's sake.

992
01:23:10,821 --> 01:23:14,586
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For Pete's sake, he's fleeing the interview!

993
01:23:16,325 --> 01:23:19,486
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do I get an outside line here?

994
01:23:24,766 --> 01:23:26,858
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yah, Detective Sibert, please.

995
01:23:28,935 --> 01:23:31,366
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told you it was over, very clearly.

996
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:34,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You made yourself perfectly clear.

997
01:23:34,375 --> 01:23:36,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But something's come up.

998
01:23:36,642 --> 01:23:37,664
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

999
01:23:38,044 --> 01:23:41,671
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something kind of small, but it might be a big problem.

1000
01:23:42,014 --> 01:23:43,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm pregnant.

1001
01:23:43,916 --> 01:23:44,903
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Huh?

1002
01:23:45,082 --> 01:23:46,446
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm pregnant.

1003
01:23:48,185 --> 01:23:50,742
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've had a test, I've got the certificates...

1004
01:23:50,955 --> 01:23:53,717
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and there's no doubt I'm gonna have your baby.

1005
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:06,481
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should see the other guy.

1006
01:24:13,375 --> 01:24:16,742
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the fuck happened to her?

1007
01:24:16,745 --> 01:24:20,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She started shrieking, you know.

1008
01:24:20,322 --> 01:24:21,512
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jesus.

1009
01:24:21,515 --> 01:24:23,209
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I got the money.
