1
00:00:11,701 --> 00:00:12,967
刚才那鬼东西是什么
What the hell was that thing?

2
00:00:12,967 --> 00:00:14,234
就这么突然窜出来
It just appeared out of nowhere.

3
00:00:14,234 --> 00:00:15,234
那尖叫
And that shriek?

4
00:00:15,234 --> 00:00:16,301
把我吓得够呛
Scared the crap out of me.

5
00:00:16,301 --> 00:00:18,701
是某种会飞的猴子?
Some kind of a flying monkey?

6
00:00:18,701 --> 00:00:20,634
飞猴?  什么东西  外空间星球上的?
A flying monkey? what is this, planet of oz?

7
00:00:20,634 --> 00:00:22,601
在我看来  说是飞  那东西更像是跳
To me, it appeared to be leaping rather than flying.

8
00:00:22,601 --> 00:00:24,334
那真是见鬼豪跳了
That was one hell of a leap.

9
00:00:24,334 --> 00:00:25,668
我只说那玩意儿看起来像只猴子
I said it looked like a monkey.

10
00:00:25,668 --> 00:00:26,668
你知道的  有毛有臂有腿来着
You know, hair, arms, legs--

11
00:00:26,668 --> 00:00:27,668
还有喙
And a beak.

12
00:00:27,668 --> 00:00:28,668
那东西没喙
Didn't have a beak.

13
00:00:28,668 --> 00:00:31,100
什么  看这里  我把它拍下来了
What? here, I uploaded it.

14
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:34,234
算你对了  总算看清那东西了
Oh. you know, that really clears things up.

15
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:35,768
你以为它长啥样  这东西想干掉我
What do you expect? it was trying to kill me.

16
00:00:35,768 --> 00:00:37,267
那鬼东西到底是什么
What the hell is that thing?

17
00:00:37,267 --> 00:00:38,534
可以派支生物小分队下去调查调查
Let's send a team of biologists down there,

18
00:00:38,534 --> 00:00:40,000
让他们研究去
Let them figure it out.

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,833
对阿尔法基地来说可能是个好去处
Might be a good place for an alpha site.

20
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,334
这星球看起来挺适合的
The planet did seem suitable--

21
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:44,867
气候适宜  物资富饶  水源充沛
Good climate, abundant food and water.

22
00:00:44,867 --> 00:00:46,734
当作一个异地据点  是最好不过的了
Excellent choice for an offworld base.

23
00:00:46,734 --> 00:00:48,234
除了那些飞猴
Aside from the flying monkeys.

24
00:00:48,234 --> 00:00:51,267
好了  罗德尼  我们回基地了
All right, we're coming into range, rodney.

25
00:00:57,401 --> 00:00:59,034
罗德尼?
Rodney?

26
00:00:59,034 --> 00:01:00,900
巨大能源脉冲
serious power spike.

27
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:01,900
这可奇怪了
That's strange.

28
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,267
出什么事了
What's wrong?

29
00:01:03,267 --> 00:01:03,534
还不知道
I don't know.

30
00:01:03,534 --> 00:01:05,667
这些读数简直乱套了
These readings are all screwy.

31
00:01:05,667 --> 00:01:06,800
驾驶失控了
I just lost steering.

32
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,167
说真的?
Really?

33
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:08,700
推进舱不会自动收起
The drive pods won't retract.

34
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,334
想点办法
Do something.

35
00:01:09,334 --> 00:01:11,034
不知道问题出哪  我也没办法
I could if I knew what the problem was.

36
00:01:11,034 --> 00:01:11,768
罗德尼
Rodney...

37
00:01:12,568 --> 00:01:13,800
等下
Just-- just hang on, hang on.

38
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,767
要是收缩不了...
Yeah, but, if those pods don't retract--

39
00:01:14,767 --> 00:01:16,633
我知道  给我点时间
I know, I know, just give me a second!

40
00:01:16,633 --> 00:01:17,967
我们没时间了
We don't have a second!

41
00:01:19,067 --> 00:01:20,434
真见鬼
What the hell?

42
00:01:22,201 --> 00:01:24,234
我们失去能源了
We just lost power.

43
00:01:24,234 --> 00:01:25,934
好吧  大家最好坐稳了
All right, you'd better hold on.

44
00:02:49,368 --> 00:02:51,001
还好
Okay, good.

45
00:02:51,001 --> 00:02:53,467
还好  是我说错了  能源还在
Good! I was wrong, we still have power.

46
00:02:53,467 --> 00:02:55,400
只是它既没供应上主系统
It's just not getting to any of the primary systems.

47
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,567
备用系统也没有
Or the secondary systems, either.

48
00:02:56,567 --> 00:02:57,567
什么原因
Why not?

49
00:02:57,567 --> 00:02:58,734
不晓得
I don't know,

50
00:02:58,734 --> 00:03:00,134
处于某种干扰吧
It's some kind of interference.

51
00:03:00,134 --> 00:03:01,667
供应不断的在波动
I'm getting spikes all over the place.

52
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:02,967
完全失控了
It's completely haywire.

53
00:03:02,967 --> 00:03:05,067
幸好调节器未受影响
Thank god the inertial dampeners weren't affected.

54
00:03:05,067 --> 00:03:06,334
只是还没有
Well, not yet.

55
00:03:06,534 --> 00:03:07,268
上帝啊
Jeez!

56
00:03:07,268 --> 00:03:09,000
刚才这下算什么
What the hell is that?

57
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,900
位移电流
Displacement current.

58
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,067
高压电!  最好避开
High voltage! do not let it hit you.

59
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:12,600
你说呢
Oh, you think?

60
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,367
可能是什么从星球上带上来的东西吧
Perhaps it's something we picked up on the planet.

61
00:03:14,367 --> 00:03:15,567
这有待检查
That is doubtful, okay?

62
00:03:15,567 --> 00:03:16,901
那儿没什么科技产物
There was nothing technological--

63
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:18,500
这星球没古人或其他什么的
I mean, ancient or other-- on that planet.

64
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,001
都是些原始生命
It was totally primordial.

65
00:03:20,001 --> 00:03:22,667
星球磁层中没有探测到任何异样
I didn't detect anything unusual in the planet's magnetosphere.

66
00:03:22,667 --> 00:03:24,734
我看  一定是飞船的电容器某处
Look, it's got to be some kind of glitch

67
00:03:24,734 --> 00:03:26,333
出了小故障
In the jumper's capacitors.

68
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,168
给我点时间  我来看看问题出哪了
Just give me a second, I'll figure out how to--

69
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:30,934
又怎么了
What?

70
00:03:30,934 --> 00:03:32,801
撞击星门减慢了我们的速度
Hitting the gate decreased our speed,

71
00:03:32,801 --> 00:03:34,300
这意味我们现在在次轨道上
Which means we're in decaying orbit.

72
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,701
如果飞船不恢复能源动力
If we don't get power back,

73
00:03:35,701 --> 00:03:37,400
我们就会在星球大气中烧毁
We're going to burn up in the atmosphere.

74
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,867
那快修复拨号装置
All right, so try to get the dhd working.

75
00:03:38,867 --> 00:03:40,334
好让我们通过星门向基地求救
We can dial the gate, radio for help.

76
00:03:40,334 --> 00:03:40,967
我试了
Well, i-i'll try,

77
00:03:40,967 --> 00:03:43,334
可是无线电通讯也受影响中断了
But the radio communications are affected as well.

78
00:03:45,634 --> 00:03:47,334
推进舱能源恢复
The drive pods are powering up.

79
00:03:47,334 --> 00:03:48,334
但是问题是
But only one of them,

80
00:03:48,334 --> 00:03:49,567
不是我干的
And it wasn't anything I did.

81
00:03:49,567 --> 00:03:50,801
我是说  就这么一切正常了
I mean, it just came back on-line.

82
00:03:50,801 --> 00:03:51,433
飞船它自己?
By itself?

83
00:03:51,433 --> 00:03:52,533
有什么区别吗
It doesn't make any difference.

84
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:53,533
继续修复拨号装置
Keep working on that dhd.

85
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:54,733
我要尽力把大伙儿送回基地
I'll try to get us back in range.

86
00:04:03,168 --> 00:04:04,900
好吧  我这儿有1个坏消息和1个好消息
Okay, I got bad news and I got good news.

87
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,434
说
What is it?

88
00:04:05,434 --> 00:04:07,767
修复拨号装置的可能性微乎其微
Slim to no chance of getting the dhd working.

89
00:04:07,767 --> 00:04:09,600
系统完全出问题了
The system is completely out of whack.

90
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,967
重新输送能源
It'll take some incredibly intricate

91
00:04:10,967 --> 00:04:11,967
基本上是非常困难的
Rerouting of the power to--

92
00:04:11,967 --> 00:04:14,167
好消息呢
Wh-- what's the good news?

93
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:15,667
这就是好消息啊
That was the good news.

94
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:17,268
坏消息是  我们失去了生命供给
The bad news is, we lost life support.

95
00:04:17,268 --> 00:04:18,168
没多少氧气了
So no air?

96
00:04:18,468 --> 00:04:20,268
是的
Right.

97
00:04:20,268 --> 00:04:21,034
所以说是坏消息
That's why it's bad.

98
00:04:21,034 --> 00:04:22,267
好吧  我们要过星门了
All right, we're back in range.

99
00:04:22,267 --> 00:04:24,867
继续试着修复  这也许是唯一机会了
Just keep working on the dhd. this may be our last shot--

100
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:28,901
发生了什么
What just happened?

101
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:30,167
不知道  但是一切都恢复正常了
I don't know, but we're back online.

102
00:04:30,167 --> 00:04:31,234
拨号装置?
Dhd?

103
00:04:31,234 --> 00:04:32,567
所有一切!
Everything!

104
00:04:32,567 --> 00:04:33,967
推进器  生命供给  什么都正常了
We got propulsion, life support, you name it.

105
00:04:38,934 --> 00:04:40,500
亚特兰蒂斯  我是谢帕德
Atlantis, this is sheppard.

106
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,901
请打开星门通道
Coming in for approach,

107
00:04:41,901 --> 00:04:42,867
但是我们系统出了点小问题
But our systems are a little whacked.

108
00:04:42,867 --> 00:04:44,134
如果10秒中内我们还没通过
If we're not there in about 10 seconds,

109
00:04:44,134 --> 00:04:45,667
派一艘飞船前来援助
Send a jumper for us.

110
00:04:45,667 --> 00:04:46,967
收到  中校
Copy that, colonel.

111
00:04:46,967 --> 00:04:49,067
别掉以轻心
Brace yourselves again.

112
00:05:05,874 --> 00:05:08,141
其他飞船有类似情况不
Any of the other jumpers reporting trouble?

113
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,640
没有  很可能是偶然事件
No. probably an isolated incident,

114
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,640
但麦凯和泽兰卡会调查此事的
But mckay and zelenka are checking into it.

115
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,141
我们得停飞这艘飞船
We should probably ground the jumpers

116
00:05:14,141 --> 00:05:16,007
直到查出问题出自何处
Till we know what the problem is, though.

117
00:05:16,007 --> 00:05:17,607
好的  那个星球...
All right. but the planet--

118
00:05:17,607 --> 00:05:18,774
适合阿尔法基地不
Suitable for an alpha site?

119
00:05:18,774 --> 00:05:20,207
是的  很理想
Yeah. perfect.

120
00:05:20,207 --> 00:05:22,207
除了有些猴子一样的生物
Well, except for the monkey-like creature

121
00:05:22,207 --> 00:05:23,207
飞来飞去...
Flying around...

122
00:05:23,207 --> 00:05:24,607
但我想我们能够搞定它
But I think we can handle that.

123
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,840
猴子?
Monkey?

124
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,007
麦凯有飞猴的照片  他会拿给你的
Yeah, mckay's got some photos. he'll show 'em to you.

125
00:05:28,007 --> 00:05:30,408
你刚才说那猴子会飞?
Did you say "flying"?

126
00:05:32,941 --> 00:05:34,174
弟兄们  进展的怎么样了
So, how's it going, boys?

127
00:05:34,174 --> 00:05:35,408
修好了没
Did you get it fixed?

128
00:05:35,408 --> 00:05:36,440
没毛病好修啊
There's nothing to fix.

129
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,473
什么
What?

130
00:05:37,473 --> 00:05:38,473
我们做了电池测试
We ran a battery of tests.

131
00:05:38,473 --> 00:05:39,774
飞船功能一切正常
The jumper's in perfect condition.

132
00:05:39,774 --> 00:05:40,941
那怎么系统一下子全失灵了
How come the systems were all screwy?

133
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:41,941
你问对了
You got me.

134
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:43,107
叫我们怎么把那所谓的
We couldn't recreate

135
00:05:43,107 --> 00:05:44,141
异常现象再表演一次
Any of the so-called anomalies.

136
00:05:44,141 --> 00:05:45,740
十万个为什么先生  他也看到了
Hey, sammy skeptic, he saw it, too!

137
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,974
若楠和泰勒他们也看到了
As did ronon and teyla.

138
00:05:46,974 --> 00:05:48,074
所有主能源供应系统失灵了
All of our primary systems went down.

139
00:05:48,074 --> 00:05:49,241
好吧  我相信你
That's okay, I believe you.

140
00:05:49,241 --> 00:05:50,674
别敷衍我
I don't think you do.

141
00:05:50,674 --> 00:05:52,007
我想  之所以出现问题
I just that I think that maybe the problem

142
00:05:52,007 --> 00:05:54,241
可能是你们无意中碰到了什么东西
Might've been caused by something you unwittingly--

143
00:05:54,241 --> 00:05:55,874
我什么也没做  不管有意没意
I didn't do anything! wittingly or un.

144
00:05:55,874 --> 00:05:57,274
好吧  你们继续
Okay, okay.

145
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:58,540
飞船什么故障也没有
There's nothing wrong with the jumper?

146
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,074
现在一切完好
Well, not anymore.

147
00:06:00,074 --> 00:06:00,740
我想之前也没有什么故障
Well, I don't think there ever was anything--

148
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,540
适可而止哈
Okay, enough.

149
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,573
拜托
please.

150
00:06:36,974 --> 00:06:38,473
总控室?  我是理查德·伍尔希
Control room? this is richard woolsey.

151
00:06:38,473 --> 00:06:42,274
我走错了电梯  来到了...
I took a wrong turn in a transporter and ended up...

152
00:06:42,274 --> 00:06:44,141
我不知道现在自己在哪里
I have no idea where I am.

153
00:06:44,141 --> 00:06:46,774
电梯门打不开
But now the transporter door won't open.

154
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:50,473
能帮我确定我所处位置  并开启电梯门吗?
Can you locate me and open it, please?

155
00:06:51,941 --> 00:06:54,007
有人吗?
Hello?

156
00:06:57,274 --> 00:06:59,374
罗德尼?
Rodney?

157
00:06:59,374 --> 00:07:00,707
请说
Go ahead.

158
00:07:00,707 --> 00:07:02,807
你又在瞎玩总电源?
You messing around with the power again?

159
00:07:02,807 --> 00:07:04,440
灯光闪烁不定
The lights are flickering.

160
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,674
没错  很多人都在向我抱怨
Yeah, I'm getting reports from all over the place.

161
00:07:06,674 --> 00:07:07,540
有人吗?
Hello?

162
00:07:09,374 --> 00:07:12,041
罗德尼...
Rodney...

163
00:07:12,301 --> 00:07:13,301
你有没注意到...
Have you noticed the--

164
00:07:13,301 --> 00:07:14,134
是的
Yes.

165
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:14,967
那你有没有...
Well, do you have any-

166
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:15,800
没有
not yet.

167
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,701
局部的?
Localized?

168
00:07:16,701 --> 00:07:18,634
不  整个城市的能量都中断了
No. got power disruptions all over the city.

169
00:07:18,634 --> 00:07:20,201
那零点装置呢?
Oh. zpm?

170
00:07:20,201 --> 00:07:21,800
还在运转  能量充足
Still online, plenty of power.

171
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,134
突然就...
It's just suddenly become, uh--

172
00:07:24,134 --> 00:07:25,234
...不稳定了
...unstable.

173
00:07:25,234 --> 00:07:26,668
听起来就像你说的
Sounds not unlike what you said

174
00:07:26,668 --> 00:07:27,967
和发生在飞船上的一样
Happened in the puddle jumper.

175
00:07:27,967 --> 00:07:29,434
是的 很明显是一样
Yes. remarkably not unlike it.

176
00:07:29,434 --> 00:07:32,267
异常情况波及到城市的系统了?
Perhaps the anomaly spread to the city's systems?

177
00:07:32,267 --> 00:07:33,301
不可能
That's impossible.

178
00:07:33,301 --> 00:07:34,334
在我们穿过星门之前
I disabled the network connection

179
00:07:34,334 --> 00:07:35,634
我就已经断开了亚特兰蒂斯
Between the jumper and atlantis

180
00:07:35,634 --> 00:07:37,434
和飞船之间的网络
Before we even came through the gate.

181
00:07:41,434 --> 00:07:43,867
只是个巧合?
Coincidence, then?

182
00:07:46,501 --> 00:07:47,833
你们在这  我用无线电找过你们
There you are! I tried to radio you--

183
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,733
是的  通讯系统瘫了
Yeah, well, communications are down.

184
00:07:49,733 --> 00:07:50,934
没错  怎么样了
Yeah, obviously. what's up?

185
00:07:50,934 --> 00:07:51,934
我们正在修复它
We're working on it.

186
00:07:51,934 --> 00:07:53,100
什么?  我刚才差点又被
Well, I just almost got zapped

187
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,334
一连串闪电击了
By a bolt of lightning.

188
00:07:54,334 --> 00:07:55,934
什么  位移电流?  在这?
What? displacement current? here?

189
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:57,100
没错  就在这  在那个走廊里
Yeah, right there, in the corridor.

190
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,301
和我们在飞船里碰到的一样
Just like the one we had in the jumper.

191
00:07:58,301 --> 00:08:00,201
看来不是巧合了
So... not a coincidence.

192
00:08:00,201 --> 00:08:01,334
星门流失能量
We just lost power to the stargate!

193
00:08:01,334 --> 00:08:02,434
什么
What?

194
00:08:02,434 --> 00:08:05,301
大概是一种病毒  自我上传过来
Well, maybe, like, a virus uploaded itself--

195
00:08:05,301 --> 00:08:06,668
不  为了避免这些  我切断了
No, no, no, I disabled the jumper's

196
00:08:06,668 --> 00:08:08,067
和飞船的网络连接
Network connection for this very reason.

197
00:08:08,067 --> 00:08:09,700
所以这种异常不可能从
There's no way the anomaly

198
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,733
飞船传播到城市系统
Jumped to the city's systems.

199
00:08:17,134 --> 00:08:18,700
你最好弄明白
You'd better figure it out...

200
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,401
现在不管在飞船上的是什么
Because whatever was in that jumper

201
00:08:20,401 --> 00:08:22,401
它已经在这个城市了
Is now in this city.

202
00:08:28,867 --> 00:08:30,234
你刚才去哪了
Where've you been?

203
00:08:30,234 --> 00:08:31,767
城市的另一边
On the other side of the city.

204
00:08:31,767 --> 00:08:34,434
电梯出了故障把我送到了东面码头
Transporter malfunctioned and sent me to the east pier.

205
00:08:34,434 --> 00:08:36,367
我是自己走回来的
I had to walk all the way back.

206
00:08:36,367 --> 00:08:37,967
整个城市的能源都中断了
We've got power disruptions all over the city.

207
00:08:37,967 --> 00:08:40,201
几乎所有系统都受到了影响
Nearly every system is affected.

208
00:08:40,201 --> 00:08:41,568
我想可能是飞船上的
We think whatever was wrong with the jumper

209
00:08:41,568 --> 00:08:43,034
什么东西感染了城市系统
Has infected atlantis.

210
00:08:43,034 --> 00:08:44,234
那只是其中一种可能性
It's one of several possibilities

211
00:08:44,234 --> 00:08:45,267
我们正在找出来
We're looking into.

212
00:08:45,267 --> 00:08:46,267
其中一种?
Several?

213
00:08:46,267 --> 00:08:47,800
那只是可能
It's a possibility.

214
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,301
事实是  我们也不知道
All right? the point is, we have no idea

215
00:08:49,301 --> 00:08:50,601
这里到底怎么了
What's going on here.

216
00:08:50,601 --> 00:08:52,134
我差点被电光劈死
I was almost hit by a bolt of lightning.

217
00:08:52,134 --> 00:08:53,434
欢迎加入倒霉蛋行列
Yeah. join the club.

218
00:08:53,434 --> 00:08:55,434
能量形成后再被高压的
The energy builds up in one are and then discharges,

219
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:57,767
位移电流释放
In a high-voltage displacement current.

220
00:08:57,767 --> 00:08:59,867
不稳定而且致命
Very erratic, very lethal.

221
00:08:59,867 --> 00:09:01,134
我呼过你
I tried to radio you.

222
00:09:01,134 --> 00:09:02,634
没错  但是通讯系统当掉了
Yeah, well, communications are also down.

223
00:09:02,634 --> 00:09:04,401
星门也是
So is the stargate.

224
00:09:04,401 --> 00:09:06,534
我们不能向地球拨号了?
We can't dial earth?

225
00:09:06,534 --> 00:09:08,100
别担心  好吗
Don't worry. all right?

226
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,434
我会找出原因的
I will figure it out.

227
00:09:09,434 --> 00:09:12,167
我运行了一些诊断程序  缩小和...
I just got to run a few diagnostics, narrow down and --

228
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:20,534
这可不妙
Well, that can't be good.

229
00:09:24,767 --> 00:09:26,634
好吧
Okay. okay...

230
00:09:26,634 --> 00:09:28,900
我们得组织一些小组
We, uh... we need to organize some teams,

231
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,700
分散到各个地点
Fan out through the city,

232
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,767
让所有人都保持镇定
Keep everyone calm

233
00:09:31,767 --> 00:09:33,867
直到我们找出来究竟是...
Until we figure out exactly what the--

234
00:09:37,401 --> 00:09:39,301
这笔记本自己启动了
The laptop just booted up.

235
00:09:39,301 --> 00:09:41,334
可能里面有电池
Probably just the battery.

236
00:09:41,334 --> 00:09:43,267
不  他是接到能源系统上的
No, no, no, it's drawing power from the system.

237
00:09:43,267 --> 00:09:45,601
每样东西都停了  除了你的电脑?
So everything's out except your computer?

238
00:09:45,601 --> 00:09:48,833
我和你一样糊涂
I'm as confused as you are.

239
00:09:54,701 --> 00:09:55,433
那是什么
what is that?

240
00:09:55,434 --> 00:09:57,833
像是什么代码
some like of code

241
00:09:58,701 --> 00:09:59,233
也许是
may be

242
00:09:59,411 --> 00:10:00,433
也有可能是信息
could be a message

243
00:10:08,701 --> 00:10:09,433
求助?
help?

244
00:10:12,601 --> 00:10:13,433
你是谁
who are you?

245
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:19,033
伊丽莎白·韦尔
elizabeth weir

246
00:10:29,767 --> 00:10:32,600
韦尔博士
Dr. weir?

247
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,767
她已经死了
But she's dead.

248
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:37,867
我们是这么被告知的
So we've been told.

249
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,134
或许...
Perhaps...

250
00:10:42,134 --> 00:10:45,367
你应该回应她
You should answer her.

251
00:10:45,367 --> 00:10:47,700
对
Right.

252
00:10:51,501 --> 00:10:52,467
你在哪里
where are you?

253
00:10:54,507 --> 00:10:55,478
在计算机里
computer

254
00:10:56,201 --> 00:10:57,433
在计算机里?
In the computer?

255
00:10:57,433 --> 00:10:59,433
她怎么会在计算机里
How can she be in the computer?

256
00:11:01,567 --> 00:11:02,700
现在情况很不好
difficult current conditon

257
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:07,700
发生什么事了
what happened to you?

258
00:11:17,667 --> 00:11:19,700
亚空间...不好控制...正在试图...
subspace...difficult control...trying to...

259
00:11:27,967 --> 00:11:29,100
是你弄的吗
Did you do that?

260
00:11:39,667 --> 00:11:40,800
还在吗
are you still there?

261
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:44,900
帮帮我
help me

262
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,133
好了  罗德尼?
All right. rodney?

263
00:11:53,433 --> 00:11:55,201
罗德尼  回话
Rodney, come in.

264
00:11:55,201 --> 00:11:58,201
罗德尼  能听到吗
Rodney? can you hear me?

265
00:11:58,201 --> 00:11:59,467
说吧
Go ahead.

266
00:11:59,467 --> 00:12:00,368
我已经完成了升级程序
I've completed the patch.

267
00:12:00,368 --> 00:12:02,168
等你准备好后就试试吧
Go ahead and try it. whenever you're ready.

268
00:12:02,168 --> 00:12:04,201
好的  上帝保佑
Okay... fingers crossed.

269
00:12:04,201 --> 00:12:05,433
你在做什么
What are you doing?

270
00:12:05,733 --> 00:12:07,567
不管这个东西是什么
Well, whatever this entity is,

271
00:12:07,567 --> 00:12:10,001
它完全压倒了我们的城市系统
It's completely overwhelming the city's systems.

272
00:12:10,001 --> 00:12:11,401
如果摊开来看
It's spread out,

273
00:12:11,401 --> 00:12:14,367
它有很多零碎的程序
Like dozens of fragmented programs

274
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:15,401
就是那些搞破坏的
That are fouling up

275
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,167
破坏能源管理系统  破坏通讯系统  随便什么
Power management, communications, you name it.

276
00:12:18,367 --> 00:12:20,333
现在我把他们组合起来
Now, I've managed to merge them,

277
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:23,534
放入一个更大的程序里
To patch them together into one incredibly large program

278
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:27,101
那样一来可使我们的系统稍微稳定些
That will,A), hopefully render our systems slightly more stable,

279
00:12:27,101 --> 00:12:29,067
二来可以让我们更好的
And, b), allow us to better communicate

280
00:12:29,067 --> 00:12:31,333
和这个管它是什么东西的
With whoever or whatever it is

281
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,500
自称是韦尔博士的人交流
That's claiming to be dr. weir.

282
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,134
把所有程序整合起来
Isn't merging all these programs

283
00:12:34,134 --> 00:12:35,510
不是有潜在危险吗
Potentially dangerous?

284
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:36,234
嗯  是的
Well, hell, yeah.

285
00:12:36,234 --> 00:12:37,834
但是总比让这个东西
But it's no more dangerous than allowing this thing

286
00:12:37,834 --> 00:12:39,901
继续大肆破坏城市系统来的强
To continue wreaking havoc on the city's systems.

287
00:12:39,901 --> 00:12:41,634
还要算上被电劈死
Or getting zapped by bolts of lightning.

288
00:12:41,634 --> 00:12:44,033
好的  我试着合成出
Okay, so, let's see if I can synthesize

289
00:12:44,033 --> 00:12:45,134
一种适当频率的音频
A voice to communicate with.

290
00:12:45,134 --> 00:12:48,168
用来和伊丽莎白交流
Elizabeth, if I make the proper calibrations,

291
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:50,100
她应该也能听到我们
She should be able to hear us too.

292
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:52,401
现在...
Now...

293
00:12:54,101 --> 00:12:55,134
伊丽莎白?
Elizabeth?

294
00:12:56,134 --> 00:12:57,233
罗德尼?
Rodney?

295
00:12:58,801 --> 00:13:00,433
是不是就我觉得...或者
Is it just me,

296
00:13:00,433 --> 00:13:02,734
这"伊丽莎白"听起来怎么有点不一样?
Or does, uh, "elizabeth" sound a little different?

297
00:13:02,734 --> 00:13:03,967
我正在弄
I'm on it, I'm on it.

298
00:13:10,734 --> 00:13:13,667
你是伊丽莎白·韦尔吗
Are you elizabeth weir?

299
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,101
是的  罗德尼  是我
Yes, rodney. it's me.

300
00:13:15,101 --> 00:13:16,734
我尽量了
It's the best I can do.

301
00:13:16,734 --> 00:13:19,834
我很抱歉引起这些麻烦
I'm sorry to cause all this trouble.

302
00:13:19,834 --> 00:13:22,101
谁和你在一起   约翰·谢帕德在吗
Who's there with you? is john sheppard there?

303
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,801
我在
Hi.

304
00:13:25,801 --> 00:13:28,101
能再听到你的声音真好
It's so good to hear your voice again.

305
00:13:28,101 --> 00:13:30,367
我们...
We, uh...

306
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:34,268
都以为你...死了
Thought you were... dead.

307
00:13:34,268 --> 00:13:35,700
我是的
I suppose I am.

308
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,734
我的肉体...是的
My... my physical body, anyway.

309
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:40,300
但是我的意识还很完整
But my consciousness is still intact.

310
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,300
是的  出什么事了
Right. so, um... what happened?

311
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,267
你记得那天
Do you remember the day I ordered you

312
00:13:44,267 --> 00:13:45,534
我命令你离开  不要管我吗
To leave me behind?

313
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:46,734
约翰
John!

314
00:13:46,734 --> 00:13:47,801
伊丽莎白
Elizabeth!

315
00:13:47,801 --> 00:13:49,134
走
Go!

316
00:13:53,101 --> 00:13:55,667
是的  我记得
Yeah... yeah, I remember.

317
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:56,634
在那之后
Well, after that,

318
00:13:56,634 --> 00:13:58,367
复制人把我带到了一个实验室
The replicators took me to a lab.

319
00:13:58,367 --> 00:14:00,567
我身体里的纳米细胞被释放了
The nanites in my body were unleashed

320
00:14:00,567 --> 00:14:01,634
而且可以复制
And allowed to replicate.

321
00:14:01,634 --> 00:14:05,034
我加入了复制人的行列  但是在新形态中
I joined the population, but even in my new form,

322
00:14:05,034 --> 00:14:06,967
我原始的意识还保留了下来
My original consciousness was still there.

323
00:14:06,967 --> 00:14:09,001
我还是我
I was still me.

324
00:14:09,001 --> 00:14:10,834
我想把意识藏起来
I tried to hide it,

325
00:14:10,834 --> 00:14:12,567
但是一些复制人还是能注意到
But a few of the others could sense it.

326
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,767
他们是纳姆的残存人员
They were remnants of niam's old group.

327
00:14:17,767 --> 00:14:19,600
我相信你遇到了一些他们的作品
I believe you encountered some of their handiwork--

328
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,967
复制版本的我还有你和你的小组
Replicator-built human versions of me and your team.

329
00:14:24,867 --> 00:14:27,067
你听说过这个  是吧
Hmm. you heard about that, did you?

330
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:29,234
他们死后我才知道的
Only after they were killed.

331
00:14:30,934 --> 00:14:34,367
那另外的那个你  人类的...那个
Now, the other you, the human... one,

332
00:14:34,367 --> 00:14:36,433
她认为你已经被消灭了
She thought you'd been destroyed.

333
00:14:36,433 --> 00:14:38,234
那正是我们小队队长
That's what the leaders of our group

334
00:14:38,234 --> 00:14:39,233
希望她相信的
Wanted her to believe.

335
00:14:39,233 --> 00:14:42,134
为了安全起见  他们刻意使我们分开
They kept us apart deliberately,for security reasons.

336
00:14:42,234 --> 00:14:44,767
这些都确实很有意思
This is all very interesting, I'm sure.

337
00:14:45,067 --> 00:14:46,701
但是还不能解释
But none of it explains

338
00:14:46,701 --> 00:14:49,634
你怎么会变成虚拟的声音
How you've come to be a disembodied voice

339
00:14:49,634 --> 00:14:51,534
出现在我们的电脑系统里
In our computer system.

340
00:14:51,534 --> 00:14:54,134
是...理查德·伍尔希吗
Is that... richard woolsey?

341
00:14:54,134 --> 00:14:55,734
是的
Um, yes.

342
00:14:55,734 --> 00:14:57,467
是我
it is.

343
00:14:57,467 --> 00:15:00,001
我是新的...
I'm the, uh, the new--

344
00:15:00,001 --> 00:15:01,867
新的指挥官
The new you.

345
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:03,300
我明白了
I see.

346
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,967
那么  发生什么事情了
So what-- what-- what happened?

347
00:15:06,967 --> 00:15:09,367
你怎么会
How did you...

348
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,268
以这样的形态
End up...

349
00:15:11,268 --> 00:15:13,267
来到这里?
In there?

350
00:15:13,267 --> 00:15:14,567
我们在逃亡
We were on the run.

351
00:15:14,567 --> 00:15:16,568
欧博罗斯和其他人千方百计的追捕我们
Oberoth and the others were hunting us down

352
00:15:16,568 --> 00:15:18,367
因为他觉得我们信仰异教邪说
For our heretical beliefs.

353
00:15:18,367 --> 00:15:20,101
因此  找到并消灭我们
It was only a matter of time

354
00:15:20,101 --> 00:15:22,101
只是时间问题
Before we'd be captured and destroyed,

355
00:15:22,101 --> 00:15:24,933
除非有奇迹出现
Unless something miraculous happened.

356
00:15:25,701 --> 00:15:27,834
然而奇迹真的出现了
And something did.

357
00:15:31,634 --> 00:15:32,967
我们的消息是正确的
Our intel was correct...

358
00:15:32,967 --> 00:15:34,734
那个星球已经完全被摧毁了
The planet has been completely destroyed.

359
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:37,400
你能找到复制人的痕迹吗
Can you detect any trace replicator cells?

360
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,400
不能
Negative.

361
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,801
他们已经完全被消灭了
They've been completely wiped out.

362
00:15:40,801 --> 00:15:42,067
好
Good...

363
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:44,367
我们终于可以心无旁骛地
We can finally get to work

364
00:15:44,367 --> 00:15:46,400
开始我们的工作了
Without having to look over our shoulders.

365
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,734
是时候开始了...
It's time to begin...

366
00:15:52,767 --> 00:15:55,300
那不是奇迹
Uh, well, that wasn't a miracle,

367
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,534
是我们干的
That was us.

368
00:15:56,534 --> 00:15:59,067
我们摧毁了复制人的星球
We destroyed the replicator homeworld.

369
00:15:59,067 --> 00:16:00,434
我知道
I know.

370
00:16:00,434 --> 00:16:01,801
对你们  我们感激不尽
We owe you a debt of gratitude,

371
00:16:01,801 --> 00:16:03,534
因为是你们  帮助我们
Because it allowed us

372
00:16:03,534 --> 00:16:05,100
安心地追求我们的理想
To pursue our goal in peace.

373
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,100
你指"升天"?
You mean ascension?

374
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,767
对  泰勒
Exactly, teyla.

375
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:13,033
我们找到了合适的星球  接着开展工作
We found a suitable planet and began our work.

376
00:16:13,033 --> 00:16:14,634
我尽可能的帮他们
I did what I could to help them.

377
00:16:14,634 --> 00:16:16,434
我引导他们去冥想
I tried to lead them in meditation,

378
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:19,234
教他们如何"卸掉重负"
To teach them how to "release their burden,"

379
00:16:19,234 --> 00:16:22,434
但是这很困难
But it was difficult.

380
00:16:22,434 --> 00:16:24,767
我来猜猜  你们本身是机械体的问题
Let me guess-- you ran into a small hiccup

381
00:16:24,767 --> 00:16:26,734
把你囧到了
With the fact that you're all machines?

382
00:16:26,734 --> 00:16:28,467
是的
Yes.

383
00:16:28,467 --> 00:16:29,567
我想说的是
Well, as much as I'd like to say

384
00:16:29,567 --> 00:16:31,300
这不大可能
We didn't see that coming...

385
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,667
你知道的  我们以前试过的
We, you know, did.

386
00:16:33,667 --> 00:16:35,467
我们中的一员  卡拉森
One of our group, koracen,

387
00:16:35,467 --> 00:16:37,300
他认为  我们是科技的产物
Argued that it was a mistake

388
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,868
而回避这一点  是一种错误
To try and run away from our technological origin,

389
00:16:39,868 --> 00:16:41,400
我们该利用这一点
That we should embrace it

390
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,901
从科技的角度来找到的解决方法
And find a technological solution.

391
00:16:43,901 --> 00:16:46,767
我们知道复制人的意识可以数字化
We know that a replicator mind can be digitized

392
00:16:46,767 --> 00:16:49,300
还可以在个体间转移
And transferred from one body to another.

393
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,801
我找到了一个方法
But I've discovered a way that will allow us

394
00:16:51,801 --> 00:16:55,467
可以让我们以能量场的形式存在
To exist indefinitely as fields of energy...

395
00:16:55,467 --> 00:16:59,300
有效的上传自身进入亚空间
Effectively uploading ourselves into subspace,

396
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,467
那么我们就可以自由的翱翔于这个星系
Where we'll be free to move about the galaxy

397
00:17:01,467 --> 00:17:03,901
可以脱离我们的机械体
Unencumbered by physical existence.

398
00:17:03,901 --> 00:17:05,200
那我们的身体怎么办
What would happen to our bodies?

399
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,467
像灰尘一样
The nanite bonds holding them together

400
00:17:07,467 --> 00:17:08,634
四处飘散
Would be severed.

401
00:17:08,634 --> 00:17:09,934
你的意思是  实体完全毁掉
You mean they'll be destroyed?

402
00:17:09,934 --> 00:17:12,234
是的  因为我们已经不再需要
Yes, but we'll no longer need them.

403
00:17:12,234 --> 00:17:13,534
卡拉森  假如不成功的话...
Koracen, if this doesn't work...

404
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:15,434
肯定会成功的
It will work.

405
00:17:16,534 --> 00:17:18,601
你告诉过我们  成功的升天
You told us that ascension is achieved

406
00:17:18,601 --> 00:17:22,501
是当身体被转化成纯粹的能量
When the physical body is transformed into pure energy.

407
00:17:22,801 --> 00:17:24,901
我能做到这一点
I can make that happen for us.

408
00:17:24,901 --> 00:17:26,434
一旦到了亚空间
Once in subspace,

409
00:17:26,434 --> 00:17:28,367
没什么能阻挡我们
Nothing can prevent us

410
00:17:28,367 --> 00:17:32,067
进入一个更高阶段的生存形式
From continuing on to the next plane of existence.

411
00:17:32,067 --> 00:17:34,801
你准备好了吗
Are you ready?

412
00:17:46,868 --> 00:17:49,701
完成了
It's done.

413
00:17:51,801 --> 00:17:53,400
机器升天?
Machine ascension?

414
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,234
然后并没有成功
Except it didn't work.

415
00:17:56,234 --> 00:17:58,434
并没有下一个进程
There was no next step,

416
00:17:58,434 --> 00:17:59,801
在任何一个感官的世界
No "ascension"

417
00:17:59,801 --> 00:18:01,701
根本没有所谓的升天
In any meaningful sense of the word.

418
00:18:01,701 --> 00:18:04,067
从那时起  我们就困在了亚空间
We've been stuck in subspace ever since.

419
00:18:04,067 --> 00:18:06,234
那是什么感觉
What is it like?

420
00:18:06,234 --> 00:18:08,968
不断的能量跃动
Oh... constant motion.

421
00:18:08,968 --> 00:18:10,701
震耳欲聋的噪音
And deafening noise.

422
00:18:10,701 --> 00:18:13,901
犹如难以想象的偏头痛
It's like the worst migraine you could possibly imagine.

423
00:18:13,901 --> 00:18:15,300
我不知道
I don't know.

424
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,734
我的偏头痛很严重
I've had some pretty horrendous migraines--

425
00:18:16,734 --> 00:18:18,367
我们开始在整个星系中寻找
We started searching the galaxy,

426
00:18:18,367 --> 00:18:21,667
可以让我们重回实体的方法
Looking for a way to regain any kind of physical form.

427
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,067
我们去过
We came across

428
00:18:23,067 --> 00:18:24,734
一些科技发达的国家...
A few other technologically advanced societies...

429
00:18:24,734 --> 00:18:26,434
真的?  在这个星系里?
Really? in this galaxy?

430
00:18:26,434 --> 00:18:29,033
你会惊讶  有这么多科技发达的社会
You'd be surprised how many more are out there,

431
00:18:29,033 --> 00:18:31,767
藏在幽灵族的眼皮底下
Keeping themselves hidden from the wraith.

432
00:18:31,767 --> 00:18:34,400
我们控制过许多电脑系统
We occupied various computer systems,

433
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,934
甚至短暂的控制了幽灵的系统
Even wraith tech for a short while.

434
00:18:35,934 --> 00:18:38,400
幽灵系统?  真的?
Wraith tech? really?

435
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,767
那里非常不舒服
It was extremely unpleasant.

436
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,601
事实上  无论我们怎样呕心沥血
In fact, no matter where we looked,

437
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:45,701
我们都找不到哪种科技手段
We couldn't find any technology that would allow us to exist

438
00:18:45,701 --> 00:18:49,267
能让我们象以前一样生活
As anything even remotely like what we were before.

439
00:18:49,267 --> 00:18:51,133
这就是你来这里的原因
Which is why you came here.

440
00:18:51,133 --> 00:18:52,868
你知道亚特兰蒂斯的电脑
You knew that atlantis's computers

441
00:18:52,868 --> 00:18:55,300
拥有足够大的能量
Were big enough and powerful enough

442
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,534
来容纳你
To house your entire program.

443
00:18:56,534 --> 00:18:58,200
其他一些古人
The others

444
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,167
变的很失落  而且变得充满仇恨
Were growing increasingly frustrated, and bitter.

445
00:18:59,167 --> 00:19:00,634
我离开了他们
I broke away from them,

446
00:19:00,634 --> 00:19:02,300
独自来找你们
And started looking for you on my own.

447
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,267
我在整个星系找了几个月
I searched the galaxy for months,

448
00:19:04,267 --> 00:19:05,801
接着我找到你的飞船
And then I detected your puddle jumper

449
00:19:05,801 --> 00:19:07,434
和它连接上了
And connected with it.

450
00:19:07,434 --> 00:19:09,133
也险些把我们害死了
Nearly killing us in the process.

451
00:19:09,133 --> 00:19:11,701
我很抱歉
I'm sorry for that.

452
00:19:11,701 --> 00:19:13,901
我目前的状况
My current condition

453
00:19:13,901 --> 00:19:16,434
很不稳定  很难自控
Is extremely volatile, difficult to control.

454
00:19:16,434 --> 00:19:18,367
尤其在开始的阶段
Especially during the initial moments,

455
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:20,534
尝试融入新系统的时候
Trying to interface with new tech.

456
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,367
但是我不知道还能去哪里
But I didn't know where else to turn.

457
00:19:22,367 --> 00:19:25,033
你们是我唯一的朋友
You're the only friends I have.

458
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,634
别问我  这是个骗局
You ask me, it's a trick.

459
00:19:33,634 --> 00:19:35,400
有人在冒充韦尔博士
Someone just pretending to be dr. weir.

460
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,801
那万一是她呢
But what if it is her?

461
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:37,934
我们还有古人的机器
We still have the ancient machine I used

462
00:19:37,934 --> 00:19:39,133
我曾经用它来制造弗兰
To build fran.

463
00:19:39,133 --> 00:19:41,067
我能不费吹灰之力造出复制人....
I could easily build another replicator to--

464
00:19:41,067 --> 00:19:41,934
不
No!

465
00:19:41,934 --> 00:19:43,334
我有后门程序  自杀按钮
I'd put in failsafes, a kill switch.

466
00:19:43,334 --> 00:19:44,801
听着  我的意思是
Look, what I'm saying is,

467
00:19:44,801 --> 00:19:46,133
我所掌握的先进技术....
That with all the advancements I've been able to make--

468
00:19:46,133 --> 00:19:48,501
为你所掌握的先进技术感到骄傲
With all due respect to the advancements you've made,

469
00:19:48,501 --> 00:19:49,701
但是  有一件事情永远不变
One thing remains constant--

470
00:19:49,701 --> 00:19:50,934
复制人过于强大
Replicators are far too powerful

471
00:19:50,934 --> 00:19:52,734
我们一点都不该信任他们
To even think about trusting them.

472
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:54,334
他们已经是2个星系的罪魁祸首了
They've been the scourge of two galaxies.

473
00:19:54,334 --> 00:19:55,567
你比我更清楚
You know better than anyone

474
00:19:55,567 --> 00:19:57,133
消灭他们更是难上加难
How difficult it was to get rid of them.

475
00:19:57,133 --> 00:19:58,467
那我们拿她怎么办
Then what should we do with her?

476
00:19:58,467 --> 00:19:59,567
她不能呆在这里
Well, she can't stay where she is.

477
00:19:59,567 --> 00:20:01,267
她会让我们的电脑崩溃的
She's frying the city's computers.

478
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:04,167
也许我们可以把她或者它
Well, maybe we can upload her--

479
00:20:04,167 --> 00:20:05,901
随便怎么称呼
Or it or whatever this thing is--

480
00:20:05,901 --> 00:20:06,934
上传送进虚拟世界
Into a virtual reality,

481
00:20:06,934 --> 00:20:08,601
就像我们处理艾娃一样?
Like we did with ava?

482
00:20:08,601 --> 00:20:10,100
也许能行  但也很困难啊
That could work, but it wouldn't be easy,

483
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,300
尤其是她不想离开
Especially if she doesn't want to go.

484
00:20:12,634 --> 00:20:14,834
我们可以和她沟通啊
We'll... talk to her.

485
00:20:14,834 --> 00:20:18,133
罗德尼  我们刚检测到在南码头实验室
Rodney, we just detected anomalous energy levels

486
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,133
有异常的能量跃动
In the south pier lab.

487
00:20:19,133 --> 00:20:20,167
复制人制造器
The replicator machine.

488
00:20:20,167 --> 00:20:21,634
她在给自己制造身体
She's building herself a body.

489
00:20:21,634 --> 00:20:22,934
她一定是在数据库里找到的
She must've found it in the database.

490
00:20:22,934 --> 00:20:24,033
切断那个地方的电源
Shut down power to that room.

491
00:20:24,033 --> 00:20:25,334
我试过了
I-i tried.

492
00:20:25,334 --> 00:20:26,534
我甚至用无线遥控来切断
I've also tried to radio down there,

493
00:20:26,534 --> 00:20:27,434
但无线不能用
But communications are still offline.

494
00:20:30,434 --> 00:20:32,101
发生什么了
What's going on?

495
00:20:32,101 --> 00:20:33,401
门被重重关上了
Door slammed shut.

496
00:20:33,401 --> 00:20:34,801
打不开
Can't get it open.

497
00:20:34,801 --> 00:20:35,401
好  让开
okay, move!

498
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:37,501
呼救支援  带一些重武器过来
Go get some back-up, some heavy arms,

499
00:20:37,501 --> 00:20:39,200
封锁这里的所有走廊
And cover every corridor out of here.

500
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,534
带些C4炸弹  我们要炸开这个门
Get some c4. we'll have to blast this door.

501
00:20:41,534 --> 00:20:43,067
不行  控制板很烫
No, panel is toast.

502
00:20:43,267 --> 00:20:46,434
还有其他入口吗
Is there another door we can access?

503
00:20:50,033 --> 00:20:51,600
大家好
Hello.

504
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,701
听我说  我是伊丽莎白·韦尔
Listen to me-- I'm elizabeth weir.

505
00:21:03,701 --> 00:21:05,400
她明显是着急了
Obviously she was in a hurry,

506
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,834
就使用了存在机器中的
She just used the previous replicator template

507
00:21:06,834 --> 00:21:07,834
先前的复制人模板
That was already in the machine,

508
00:21:07,834 --> 00:21:09,667
是弗兰
Which was fran.

509
00:21:09,667 --> 00:21:12,068
约翰  我对你们没有恶意
John, I'm not a threat to you.

510
00:21:12,068 --> 00:21:13,434
不管你是什么
Well, whatever you are,

511
00:21:13,434 --> 00:21:14,968
我得说  重建了一具复制人的躯体
I'd say building a replicator body

512
00:21:14,968 --> 00:21:16,300
算是个相当大的威胁
Is a pretty big threat.

513
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,434
伊丽莎白·韦尔决不会干这种事
Elizabeth weir would never do such a thing.

514
00:21:18,434 --> 00:21:21,601
机器已经关闭
Okay... the machine is deactivated.

515
00:21:21,601 --> 00:21:23,334
远离控制晶体
Removed the control crystal,

516
00:21:23,334 --> 00:21:25,467
这样没有人能继续制造出更多的复制人
Which means no one will be building any more replicators.

517
00:21:25,467 --> 00:21:27,233
相信我  我和你们一样疑虑
Believe me, I was just as concerned

518
00:21:27,233 --> 00:21:28,634
我这么做究竟对不对
About doing this as you.

519
00:21:28,634 --> 00:21:30,667
不过罗德尼对这项技术
But the adjustments rodney's made

520
00:21:30,667 --> 00:21:33,133
所作的调整  消除了一切危险性
To this technology eliminate any danger.

521
00:21:33,133 --> 00:21:34,701
我不能复制
I can't replicate,

522
00:21:34,701 --> 00:21:36,667
当我的意识开始控制这副躯体
And since my consciousness is controlling this body,

523
00:21:36,667 --> 00:21:37,734
我真的相信
I truly believe--

524
00:21:37,734 --> 00:21:39,133
你的意识
Your consciousness?

525
00:21:39,133 --> 00:21:40,601
无意冒犯  但我还没完全信服
No offense, but I'm not completely sold

526
00:21:40,601 --> 00:21:42,634
你自诩的身份
On your being who you say you are.

527
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:45,100
我也不信
That makes two of us.

528
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,801
我理解你们对我的怀疑
I understand your skepticism,

529
00:21:47,801 --> 00:21:49,500
但我的确是伊丽莎白·韦尔
But I am elizabeth weir.

530
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,167
但愿我有办法向你们证实
I wish there was some way I could prove it to you.

531
00:21:52,167 --> 00:21:53,867
那可难了
That'll be difficult.

532
00:21:53,867 --> 00:21:55,867
复制人俘获韦尔博士之后
Any personal information or memories

533
00:21:55,867 --> 00:21:57,534
任何私人信息和记忆
Could have easily been mined

534
00:21:57,534 --> 00:21:58,567
都可以从她的意识中
From dr. weir's consciousness

535
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,068
轻易获取
When the replicators captured her.

536
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:01,634
我知道
I know.

537
00:22:01,634 --> 00:22:04,100
所以让我先提供些有价值的东西以示诚意
At least let me start by offering something of value.

538
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,100
我们洗耳恭听
Let's hear it.

539
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,734
我们变型之后
The technical specs

540
00:22:06,734 --> 00:22:08,567
所寄居过的几个系统的
Of several of the systems we've inhabited

541
00:22:08,567 --> 00:22:09,634
技术资料
Since our transformation...

542
00:22:09,634 --> 00:22:12,334
包括幽灵人的技术
Including wraith tech--

543
00:22:12,334 --> 00:22:15,734
我已经上传到你们的计算机上了
I've already uploaded them to your computer.

544
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:17,267
真的吗
Really?

545
00:22:17,267 --> 00:22:19,267
那...太好了
Well, that's... great.

546
00:22:19,267 --> 00:22:20,100
我只要求你们
All I ask

547
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,068
给我一个机会
Is that you give me a chance

548
00:22:21,068 --> 00:22:22,100
来赢得你们信任
To earn your trust.

549
00:22:23,767 --> 00:22:26,667
我决不会做任何事去伤害你们
I would never, ever, do anything to harm any of you,

550
00:22:26,667 --> 00:22:28,968
还有亚特兰蒂斯
Or atlantis.

551
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,500
现在有个好消息
Well, the good news is that now

552
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,534
她将自己载入了复制人躯体
She's downloaded herself into the replicator's body,

553
00:22:42,534 --> 00:22:44,534
这就不会损坏亚特兰蒂斯的计算机
She's not screwing up atlantis' computers.

554
00:22:44,534 --> 00:22:46,801
电力稳定  星门运行正常
The power's stable, the gate's working,

555
00:22:46,801 --> 00:22:48,300
电脑通信也重新连接上了
And communications are back online.

556
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,968
你确定她不能自我复制吗
You're sure she can't replicate on her own?

557
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:50,968
确定
Positive.

558
00:22:50,968 --> 00:22:52,233
我是说每项安全措施都是她设定的
I mean, she instituted every safeguard.

559
00:22:52,233 --> 00:22:54,233
如果我们把她送到一个安全地点
If we move her to a secure location,

560
00:22:54,233 --> 00:22:55,634
那么我想
Then I think--

561
00:22:55,634 --> 00:22:57,133
等一下  你不是在建议我
Wait a minute! you're not suggesting

562
00:22:57,133 --> 00:22:59,267
欣然接受把她留在这儿的想法吧
That I entertain the notion of keeping her here?

563
00:22:59,267 --> 00:23:00,534
我只是在说
I'm just saying that

564
00:23:00,534 --> 00:23:01,834
要是我们一直把她留在眼皮底下
If we keep her under constant guard,

565
00:23:01,834 --> 00:23:03,034
可以将她的威胁控制在最小
It'll minimize any threat she poses--

566
00:23:03,034 --> 00:23:04,267
万一她真有恶意的话
If she even poses a threat.

567
00:23:04,267 --> 00:23:07,300
而且还给了我们更多时间来研究她
And it'll give us more time to study her.

568
00:23:08,634 --> 00:23:10,601
来者
That thing in there...

569
00:23:10,601 --> 00:23:12,100
是一个复制人
Is a replicator.

570
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,801
即便密切监控
There are far too many ways this can go wrong,

571
00:23:13,801 --> 00:23:16,034
还是会防不胜防
Even if she's kept under constant guard.

572
00:23:16,034 --> 00:23:18,167
所有人都质疑我制造的第一个弗兰
Everyone doubted the first fran I built,

573
00:23:18,167 --> 00:23:19,634
而后来发现她极其安全
And she turned out to be perfectly safe

574
00:23:19,634 --> 00:23:20,667
极其可靠
And perfectly reliable.

575
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:22,001
没错  你造出过弗兰
That's right-- you built fran.

576
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:23,701
她的意识也是你创造的
You created her consciousness.

577
00:23:23,701 --> 00:23:25,701
如今你想相信这个新弗兰
Now, as much as you want to believe that this new fran

578
00:23:25,701 --> 00:23:27,200
真的是韦尔博士
Is indeed dr. weir,

579
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,834
我们可没那么大把握
We cannot be certain of that.

580
00:23:28,834 --> 00:23:30,200
据我们的经验
For all we know,

581
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,801
没准是欧博罗斯借茧作俑
It could be oberoth inside that body.

582
00:23:31,801 --> 00:23:33,667
好瘆人
That's creepy.

583
00:23:33,667 --> 00:23:35,634
要是它就是韦尔博士呢
What if it is dr. weir?

584
00:23:35,634 --> 00:23:37,767
这是我的错
Look, this is my fault.

585
00:23:37,767 --> 00:23:40,034
是我激活了伊丽莎白体内的纳米细胞
I'm the one who reactivated the nanites in elizabeth.

586
00:23:40,034 --> 00:23:42,601
尽管是为了救她
True, to save her, but...

587
00:23:42,601 --> 00:23:44,400
但麻烦都是我造成的
I'm the one who created this mess.

588
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,801
我想解铃还须系铃人吧
I think I should be the one to, you know, fix it.

589
00:23:49,934 --> 00:23:52,367
我欠伊丽莎白的
I owe it to elizabeth.

590
00:23:54,901 --> 00:23:57,001
我很抱歉
I'm sorry...

591
00:23:57,001 --> 00:23:59,534
太危险了
But it's too dangerous.

592
00:24:01,334 --> 00:24:02,667
我看我们还是按照原计划
I say we stick with our original plan--

593
00:24:02,667 --> 00:24:05,267
将她的意识上传到虚拟世界
Upload her consciousness into a virtual reality.

594
00:24:05,267 --> 00:24:07,801
让她在那儿证明自己
Let her prove herself there,

595
00:24:07,801 --> 00:24:10,601
在那里她也不会造成什么威胁
Where she can't do any damage.

596
00:24:19,701 --> 00:24:21,233
有孩子了
A child?

597
00:24:21,233 --> 00:24:22,567
泰勒
Oh, teyla...

598
00:24:26,233 --> 00:24:28,767
我真为你高兴
I'm so happy for you.

599
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:32,867
是男孩还是
Uh, is it a boy, or...

600
00:24:32,867 --> 00:24:34,767
男孩
Boy.

601
00:24:34,767 --> 00:24:36,601
叫什么名字
What's his name?

602
00:24:37,734 --> 00:24:39,833
图门·约翰·艾玛根
Torren John emmagan.

603
00:24:40,801 --> 00:24:43,267
图门是你父亲的名字
Torren, for your father.

604
00:24:43,267 --> 00:24:45,133
那么约翰
And, uh, john...

605
00:24:45,133 --> 00:24:47,034
是谢帕德中校
Colonel sheppard?

606
00:24:47,034 --> 00:24:49,001
是的
Yes.

607
00:24:49,001 --> 00:24:52,300
等等  你是说约翰·谢帕德是
Wait, you're not saying john sheppard is--

608
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,567
不
No.

609
00:24:53,567 --> 00:24:55,334
不是
No...

610
00:24:55,334 --> 00:24:58,267
孩子父亲是阿托斯星人
The father is athosian.

611
00:24:58,267 --> 00:25:00,100
我来猜猜  是迦楠
Let me guess... kanaan?

612
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,467
对呀  你怎么知道
Yes. how did you...

613
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:06,434
每次你说起这位"朋友"
Every time you spoke of him, this "friend,"

614
00:25:06,434 --> 00:25:08,801
你的眼睛里总是闪着光彩
There was always a sparkle in your eyes.

615
00:25:11,267 --> 00:25:15,434
那么孩子和你一起在亚特兰蒂斯吗
So, is the baby here with you in atlantis?

616
00:25:15,434 --> 00:25:17,467
不
No.

617
00:25:17,467 --> 00:25:19,467
他和他爸爸在一起
He is with his father.

618
00:25:19,467 --> 00:25:21,367
在其他地方
Off-world.

619
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,167
抱歉打扰一下
Sorry to interrupt.

620
00:25:27,167 --> 00:25:28,367
没关系
No, it's all right.

621
00:25:28,367 --> 00:25:30,601
我们谈得差不多了
We were just finishing.

622
00:25:38,167 --> 00:25:40,100
这些...不好意思了
Sorry about all this.

623
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,500
没事  我理解
It's okay, I understand.

624
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,100
刚听到泰勒的喜事
Amazing news about teyla.

625
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,934
听着
Um, look...

626
00:25:51,934 --> 00:25:54,167
我们都想相信
We all want to believe

627
00:25:54,167 --> 00:25:56,801
你说的话
You are who you say you are.

628
00:25:56,801 --> 00:25:58,434
我明白
I understand that you...

629
00:25:58,434 --> 00:26:00,267
你们必须小心谨慎
You have to be cautious,

630
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,500
但真的是我  约翰
But it really is me, john.

631
00:26:06,001 --> 00:26:08,233
你只需给我时间
You just have to give me time.

632
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,934
你会看到
You'll see that--

633
00:26:14,634 --> 00:26:16,500
哦不
Oh, no...

634
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,500
怎么了
What's wrong?

635
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:20,267
他们发现我了
They've found me.

636
00:26:20,267 --> 00:26:21,500
谁
Who?

637
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,567
其他复制人
The other replicators.

638
00:26:23,567 --> 00:26:25,934
他们正向亚特兰蒂斯赶来
They're on their way to atlantis.

639
00:26:28,133 --> 00:26:29,634
来了多少人
How many are coming?

640
00:26:29,634 --> 00:26:30,901
8个
Eight of them.

641
00:26:30,901 --> 00:26:32,734
早知道她会干出什么好事
And we saw what kind of damage one could do...

642
00:26:32,734 --> 00:26:34,068
我们要不要启动零点装置
Should we pull the zpm?

643
00:26:34,068 --> 00:26:35,467
那是最后的杀手锏  我们还没到那份上
That's a last resort. we're not there yet.

644
00:26:35,467 --> 00:26:36,801
并且我还需要它
Meanwhile, I'll need it

645
00:26:36,801 --> 00:26:38,367
帮助实施我能想出的对策
To effect any counter-measures I can come up with.

646
00:26:38,367 --> 00:26:39,567
他们多久能到
How soon will they get here?

647
00:26:39,567 --> 00:26:40,801
几分钟吧
Well, minutes, if that.

648
00:26:40,801 --> 00:26:42,934
我们能做些什么来保护我们的城市么
Is there anything we can do to protect the city?

649
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,267
你能不能竖起防火墙之类的
Can you put up some kind of firewall?

650
00:26:44,267 --> 00:26:45,034
防火墙不顶用
A firewall won't work.

651
00:26:45,034 --> 00:26:46,367
你阻挡不了他们
You can't block them,

652
00:26:46,367 --> 00:26:47,367
他们在亚空间中来去自如
They just pop in and out of subspace.

653
00:26:47,367 --> 00:26:50,134
到处都是  无法预料
They're here, they're there, it's impossible to predict.

654
00:26:50,334 --> 00:26:52,567
我可以编一个程序
I could write a program that immediately quarantines

655
00:26:52,567 --> 00:26:54,034
即时隔离系统中非正常运行的程序
Any anomalous behavior in the system,

656
00:26:54,034 --> 00:26:55,367
类似杀毒软件的东西
Like an anti-virus software.

657
00:26:55,367 --> 00:26:56,734
但是得花点时间
It's going to take some time, though.

658
00:26:56,734 --> 00:26:58,100
尽你所能吧
Just do what you can.

659
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:00,110
把弗兰  韦尔博士  不管她是谁
Keep fran, dr. weir, whoever she is--

660
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,277
监控起来
Under guard.

661
00:27:01,277 --> 00:27:03,444
暂时先不把她的意识上传到虚拟世界
We won't upload her to the vr just yet.

662
00:27:03,444 --> 00:27:06,111
也许还需要她帮忙解决问题
We may need her help dealing with them.

663
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,210
你骗了我们
You set us up.

664
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:13,310
不!  我真的以为我已经和他们断绝了联系
No! I honestly believed I had broken away

665
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:14,610
他们追踪不到我的
Without them being able to track me.

666
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:16,910
告诉他们离亚特兰蒂斯远点
Tell them to stay away from atlantis.

667
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:20,110
我会试试  不过近点会更容易(交流)
I'll try, but it'll get easier as they get closer.

668
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:22,040
听我说  我确信他们并不想伤害任何人
Look, I'm sure they don't intend to hurt anyone.

669
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,640
你告诉他们继续走  到其他地方去
You tell them to keep moving, go someplace else.

670
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,310
他可以去...
It might go a----

671
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:29,470
谢帕德
Sheppard!

672
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:31,070
说吧  罗德尼
Go ahead, Rodney.

673
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,240
他到了
...it arrived...

674
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,170
无法...运行系统...
Wasn't able... program the system...

675
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:35,670
罗德尼?
Rodney?

676
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:37,010
他们的混合力量
Their combined force

677
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:38,670
完全冲破了主能源网
Is completely overwhelming the main power grid!

678
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:39,840
谢帕德
Sheppard!

679
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,210
他们来了?
They're here?

680
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:43,170
共八人  在攻击城市的电脑
All eight of 'em, slamming the city's computers!

681
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:44,510
"杀毒"程序呢
What about the anti-virus program?

682
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:45,210
都没时间完成
Didn't have time to finish it!

683
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:46,410
行了  那可能都没用
Look, it probably wouldn't have worked anyway.

684
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:48,570
瑞迪克  我要你开启零点装置
Radek, I need you to pull the zpm,

685
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:51,010
关闭所有必要的naquadah发电机
Power down all essential naquadah generators.

686
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:52,470
瑞迪克
Radek!

687
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,640
信号又差了
Communications are down again!

688
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,770
罗德尼
Rodney!

689
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:58,070
罗德尼  我正要转换能源
Rodney, I'm trying to divert power,

690
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:00,010
但它现在太不稳定了
But it's become far too unstable.

691
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:02,510
是不是先开零点装置
Perhaps now we should pull the zpm?

692
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,970
罗德尼?
Rodney?

693
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:08,240
我们走  打开零点装置
Let's-- let's go-- pull the zpm.

694
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,570
除了主动力其他都关了
Shut down all power except for the main power.

695
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:20,270
我的天啊
Oh, god.

696
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:22,210
他死了
He's dead.

697
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:26,070
我们联系上了
We've established contact

698
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,840
一个叫卡拉森的复制人
With the replicator known as Koracen.

699
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,040
他说是代表其他人来谈话的
He claims to speak on the others' behalf.

700
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,710
卡拉森?  我是伊丽莎白·韦尔
Koracen? It's Elizabeth Weir.

701
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,870
伊丽莎白?  我们很担心你
Elizabeth? We were worried about you.

702
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:34,940
听我说
Listen to me.

703
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,840
你们要离开这儿
You need to leave this place.

704
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,070
你们造成了太多伤害
You're causing a lot of harm.

705
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,410
我们会离开的
We will leave.

706
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:42,870
但我们要先拿到身体  就像你
But first we wish to be given bodies, as you have.

707
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:45,070
我们早就告诉过你那不可能
We've already told you that's out of the question.

708
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:47,210
但伊丽莎白已经拿到了一个
And yet Elizabeth has been given one.

709
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:49,640
我们当时别无选择  而我们也不打算
It wasn't our choice, and we're not planning on

710
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,010
让她继续用这身体
Letting her keep it.

711
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:53,010
我们并不想伤害任何人
We do not wish to harm anyone.

712
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:55,010
但我们的一个朋友已经死了
One of our guys is already dead,

713
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:57,140
收回你那"我们是友好的"废话
So you can save your "we come in peace" crap!

714
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,510
卡拉森  求你了
Koracen, please.

715
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:01,410
离开这座城市  让我来和他们谈
Just leave the city and let me negotiate with them.

716
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:02,770
我们肯定会找出
I'm sure we can figure out

717
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:04,540
能帮助你的方法
Some way to help you.

718
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:05,910
帮我的方法就是
The way to help us is by

719
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,670
替换了古人机器中的控制晶体
Replacing the control crystal in the ancient machine

720
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:10,440
那我们就能重造复制体了
So that we may build replicator bodies.

721
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,070
这是你要做的
That is what you will do.

722
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:14,070
如果我们不答应呢
And if we don't?

723
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:15,140
卡拉森?
Koracen?

724
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,470
情况不妙
Not good. Not good!

725
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:20,970
门又关上了
Aw, gate's down again!

726
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:23,310
我们无法控制城市
We're losing control of the city.

727
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,810
他们关了飞船的舱门
They just shut the jumper bay doors!

728
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:27,170
他们想阻止我们离开
They're trying to keep us from leaving.

729
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:28,270
不能破除指令么
Can't you override it?

730
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,840
我被阻在外面了
I'm locked out!

731
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,910
不会吧
Oh, no.

732
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:33,370
他们还入侵了零点装置
They just engaged the zpm.

733
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:35,940
能量级上升得很快
Energy levels are rising rapidly!

734
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,270
他们这是要干吗
Why, what are they doing?

735
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:39,070
他们要沉了这城市
They're sinking the city.

736
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,240
打开防护罩
Raise the shield.

737
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,240
已经被他们破坏了
They've disabled it.

738
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:53,140
有什么主意了没
Any ideas?

739
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,710
没有  我们在下沉
No, we're going down.

740
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,040
水已经没过
Water's already cresting

741
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,370
外码头较低的甲板了
The lower decks of the outer piers.

742
00:29:57,370 --> 00:30:00,040
它随时可能冲击城市通道
It's going to breach the city corridors any second now.

743
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,570
我想你帮我传个信
I want you to send them a message for me.

744
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:23,570
我正试着和他们沟通
I've been trying to communicate with them,

745
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:25,110
让他们停下
Telling them to stop.

746
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:26,440
他们不会听我的
They won't listen to me.

747
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,010
我要说的不是这些
That's not what I want to tell them.

748
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:29,740
不是?
It's not?

749
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,940
告诉他们...继续
Tell them... to go ahead.

750
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,270
沉了这城市吧
Sink the city.

751
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:37,110
毁了他们获得机械体的
Destroy their only chance of ever regaining

752
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:39,040
唯一机会
Any kind of physical form.

753
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,510
你们已经找遍了整个星系
You've searched the entire galaxy.

754
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:43,870
你们知道复制人的家园已经不复存在
You know the replicator homeworld was destroyed.

755
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:45,270
唯一剩下的
The only place remaining

756
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:47,670
有技术能力帮助你们达到目的的
With the technology you need to achieve your goals

757
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:50,040
就只有这里
Is right here.

758
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:53,110
所以继续啊  毁了它吧
So go ahead, destroy it.

759
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:56,210
然后永生困在中间地带
Stay trapped in limbo forever.

760
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:02,610
南码头的一级已经完全没入水中
Level one of the south pier is completely under water.

761
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:05,010
他们不会停了
They won't stop.

762
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:06,470
好吧
Fine.

763
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:09,670
那我们就一起死吧
Then we'll all die together.

764
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:29,270
他们逐渐退出零点装置
They're powering down the zpm!

765
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:33,240
城市在趋于稳定
The city's stabilizing.

766
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,270
好了
All right.

767
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:44,670
我们可以来谈谈了
Now we can negotiate.

768
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:51,370
我有个建议
I have a proposal.

769
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:53,340
我已经和其他人沟通过了
I've already communicated it to the others,

770
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,810
也说服了他们达成一致
And convinced them to agree to it.

771
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:56,170
那我们来听听
Let's hear it.

772
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:58,170
人类的身体
Human bodies,

773
00:31:58,170 --> 00:31:59,640
通过纳米技术制造
Nanite-manufactured,

774
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,470
但也有血有肉
But consisting of flesh and blood.

775
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:02,940
就像另一个伊丽莎白·韦尔
Like the other Elizabeth Weir

776
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,510
你们遇到的那个
You once encountered.

777
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:06,110
我们没有这种技术
We don't have that kind of technology here.

778
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,370
但我们有
But we do.

779
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:09,810
如果你们能提供临时的复制体
If you give us temporary replicator bodies,

780
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:10,940
和一个可用的实验室
And a lab to work in,

781
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,670
我们能够自己装配
We can assemble them ourselves.

782
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,270
什么  你要从复制体
What, you'll transfer your consciousness

783
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:15,940
转移意识到人体?
From the replicator body to the human body?

784
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,770
完全正确  作为人类
Exactly. as human beings,

785
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,040
我们和其他人一样
We would be every bit as vulnerable

786
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,510
容易受伤
As anyone else.

787
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:23,210
我们要吃要睡  会生老病死
We would eat, sleep, get sick... and die.

788
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:24,710
特别是老了时
Preferably of old age.

789
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:26,240
那升天呢
What about ascension?

790
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,070
我以为那还是列在你们的日程上
I'm assuming that's still on the agenda?

791
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,140
是的
It is.

792
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,170
等等  造一个人体
Wait a second. building humans--

793
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:33,670
那需要花时间对不对
That's going to take time, isn't it?

794
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:34,870
我是说  首先你们要发明
I mean, first, you've got to create

795
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:35,970
这种技术
The technology to do it...

796
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:37,510
我们说的是纳米技术
We're talking nanites--

797
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:39,140
一般来说  配置一个身体
I mean, organically assembling each body,

798
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,910
从内到外  都要从分子层开始
Inside out, starting at the molecular level.

799
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:42,170
然后还要做一个
Then you have to create the machine

800
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:43,370
传送意识的机器
To transfer the consciousness.

801
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:45,240
天知道这要多久
I mean, that's going to take god knows how long?

802
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,740
复制人工作起来很快
Replicators, as you know, work very fast.

803
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,870
不用休息吃饭或是睡觉
No need for breaks, or food, or sleep.

804
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:51,510
这可以考虑
It's worth thinking about.

805
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:52,910
他可能是对的
He may be right.

806
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:54,970
只要能重新控制了城市
I mean, if only to regain control of the city.

807
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:56,140
如果他们还在我们的电脑系统中
While they're in our computer systems,

808
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,570
亚特兰蒂斯就很危险
Atlantis is in serious trouble.

809
00:32:57,570 --> 00:32:59,340
如果我们同意这么做
If we do this,

810
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:02,770
我希望对他们的能力有严格的限制
I want severe restrictions placed on their capabilities--

811
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:04,740
不能复制  不能变形
No replicating, no shape-shifting--

812
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,010
最基础的模式  这你放心
The basic model, you got it.

813
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:07,210
我是说  不能有附加的能力
I mean, no bells, no whistles.

814
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:08,570
他们可以做些小的修复
They'll be able to affect some minor repairs,

815
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:09,740
但仅此而已
But that's about it.

816
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,870
把实验室锁起来
Seal off the lab,

817
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:12,240
然后加个力场在周围
Put a force field around it,

818
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,270
你们觉得怎么安全就怎么做
Do whatever you need to do to feel safe.

819
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:16,040
我已经说服他们
But I've already convinced the others

820
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,910
那是他们的唯一选择了
That this is their only option.

821
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:20,510
他们不会给你们制造麻烦的
They won't give you any trouble.

822
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:26,110
我向你们保证
You have my word.

823
00:33:26,711 --> 00:33:28,477
批准
Do it.

824
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:37,143
力场初始化
Okay, initializing force field.

825
00:33:42,978 --> 00:33:44,211
你们的组员都准备就绪了吗
Are your teams in place?

826
00:33:44,211 --> 00:33:45,578
日夜不断地监视
Around-the-clock watch.

827
00:33:45,578 --> 00:33:46,178
很好
Good.

828
00:33:46,178 --> 00:33:49,077
一旦人类的肉体被制造出来
Once these human bodies are made,

829
00:33:49,077 --> 00:33:50,678
他们形神合一之后
And they're downloaded into them...

830
00:33:50,678 --> 00:33:51,578
然后呢
What happens then?

831
00:33:52,078 --> 00:33:53,410
鉴于他们和真正的人类
Seeing as they'll be just like

832
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:54,410
没什么两样
Any other human beings,

833
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:55,844
我觉得没有理由不放他们走
I see no reason not to let them go.

834
00:33:55,844 --> 00:33:57,978
他们可以成为我们有利的盟友
They could become valuable allies.

835
00:33:57,978 --> 00:34:00,044
如果他们当中  有的人拒绝形神合一怎么办
Well, what if one of 'em decides to stay?

836
00:34:00,544 --> 00:34:04,010
我们还是一步一步来吧  好吗
Let's cross one bridge at a time, all right?

837
00:34:07,177 --> 00:34:08,877
进行得怎样
How's it going?

838
00:34:08,877 --> 00:34:09,978
快要完成了
Almost done.

839
00:34:09,978 --> 00:34:13,310
正在制造最后一个人体
Just finishing up the last one.

840
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:22,844
进度神速啊
That was fast.

841
00:34:22,844 --> 00:34:25,311
事实上  制造复制人易如反掌
Well, actually, creating replicators is fairly simple,

842
00:34:25,311 --> 00:34:26,411
相对来说
Comparatively speaking.

843
00:34:26,411 --> 00:34:27,910
人类  就不尽其然
Humans, not so much.

844
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:29,577
越早完成  就越好
Well, the sooner they get it done,the better.

845
00:34:29,577 --> 00:34:31,810
当传输完成的时候
And once the last transfer is complete,

846
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:34,477
把复制人的身体全部销掉
I want those replicator bodies destroyed.

847
00:34:35,877 --> 00:34:38,211
他们真是快马加鞭  不是吗
They certainly don't waste any time, do they?

848
00:34:38,211 --> 00:34:38,911
是的  真是快
No, they don't.

849
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,311
没有间断  没有闲聊
There's no breaks, no chit-chat,

850
00:34:41,311 --> 00:34:42,644
也没有交流行为
No social interaction whatsoever.

851
00:34:42,644 --> 00:34:44,677
整个过程都全神贯注
Just the perfect working environment.

852
00:34:47,677 --> 00:34:49,243
若楠
Ronon,

853
00:34:49,243 --> 00:34:51,444
你不必整个过程都待在这
You don't have to stay there the whole time, you know.

854
00:34:51,444 --> 00:34:52,477
我没事
I'm good.

855
00:34:52,477 --> 00:34:54,177
他就整天在那唠唠叨叨
Talk, talk, talk, that's all he does.

856
00:34:54,177 --> 00:34:55,510
也没办法让他住嘴
You can't shut him up.

857
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,877
有情况  随时通知我
Keep me apprised.

858
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:23,510
麦凯  能源被切断了
Mckay! power's out!

859
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:26,044
什么...力场!
What the-- force field!

860
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:50,844
发生什么事了
what happened?

861
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:52,544
一个复制人逃跑了
one of the replicators escaped,the causing

862
00:35:52,544 --> 00:35:54,744
逃跑者早就密谋着进行某种计划
the leaper was working on some kind of hidden program

863
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:56,444
他趁着意识重回实体
and it was time to kill power

864
00:35:56,444 --> 00:35:57,744
需要切断电源的时候
as soon as they were downloading replicators' bodies

865
00:35:57,744 --> 00:35:59,078
那时候  力场停止运作
It disabled the force field,

866
00:35:59,078 --> 00:36:00,510
这样一来  他们就可以打开大门  趁机逃跑
They were able to pry open the doors.

867
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:02,477
她在哪
Where is she?

868
00:36:02,477 --> 00:36:04,377
她去追卡拉森去了
She went after koracen.

869
00:36:04,377 --> 00:36:05,577
已有3个小队在外追捕他
Three teams are in pursuit.

870
00:36:05,577 --> 00:36:06,377
所有无线电通讯系统瘫痪
We've lost all radio contact.

871
00:36:06,377 --> 00:36:07,544
去支援他们吧
Go join 'em.

872
00:36:07,544 --> 00:36:08,611
到指挥室去
Go up to the control room,

873
00:36:08,611 --> 00:36:09,877
看能不能重启电源
And try to get the power restored.

874
00:36:09,877 --> 00:36:10,711
他们怎么办
What do we do with them?

875
00:36:10,711 --> 00:36:12,143
开枪
Shoot 'em.

876
00:36:12,143 --> 00:36:13,177
一直开
Keep shooting.

877
00:36:13,177 --> 00:36:15,477
直到他们倒下为止
They'll go down eventually.

878
00:36:15,477 --> 00:36:16,611
慢着
Wait!

879
00:36:17,811 --> 00:36:20,611
我们对卡拉森的计划一无所知
We knew nothing of koracen's plan.

880
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:21,944
如果我们和他同流合污
If we were a part of it,

881
00:36:21,944 --> 00:36:23,777
我们现在就不会站在这里了
We would not be standing here right now.

882
00:36:23,777 --> 00:36:26,344
拜托了
Please?

883
00:36:26,344 --> 00:36:28,410
我们会按照你的吩咐做
We're complying with your wishes.

884
00:36:32,078 --> 00:36:34,611
确保没有人可以走出这扇门
Nothing gets through that door.

885
00:36:34,611 --> 00:36:37,277
只要他们动了一点点
If they move an inch...

886
00:36:37,277 --> 00:36:39,344
就开枪
Shoot 'em.

887
00:36:57,944 --> 00:37:01,143
慢着
Hold on!

888
00:37:01,143 --> 00:37:04,344
等不及让意识回到人类的身体的时候了吧
You just couldn't wait for those human bodies,

889
00:37:04,344 --> 00:37:05,544
是吗
Could you?

890
00:37:05,544 --> 00:37:08,243
人类的身体是那样的脆弱  渺小
The human body is frail, weak...

891
00:37:08,243 --> 00:37:10,811
每过一秒  都在向死亡迈前一步
Every second, that much closer to dying.

892
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:12,577
那关于升天的事
Yeah, and this whole ascension thing--

893
00:37:12,577 --> 00:37:14,544
你也放弃了吗
You're just giving up on that? huh?

894
00:37:14,544 --> 00:37:16,210
才不
Not at all.

895
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:18,078
肯定有别的方法可以做到
I'm certain there's another way.

896
00:37:18,078 --> 00:37:19,444
拥有了这个身躯
With this body,

897
00:37:19,444 --> 00:37:21,877
我有无穷的时间
I'll have plenty of time

898
00:37:21,877 --> 00:37:23,544
去探索它
To discover it.

899
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:35,977
有什么进展
Any luck?

900
00:37:36,077 --> 00:37:37,611
他们几乎关闭了所有的系统
They've shut just about everything down.

901
00:37:37,611 --> 00:37:39,677
尤其是一些重要的系统
Power's cut to most of the critical systems.

902
00:37:39,677 --> 00:37:41,310
除了星门拨号系统
Except for the dhd and the gate.

903
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:42,677
很明显  他们想利用星门拨号逃跑
They're obviously going to try to dial out.

904
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:45,611
现在  我修复了主机的远程控制功能
Now, I've managed to gain remote access to the mainframe.

905
00:37:45,611 --> 00:37:46,978
我建立了一个周边工作区
I'm creating a workaround

906
00:37:46,978 --> 00:37:48,744
来修复中心塔主要系统的
To allow the resumption of naquadah power

907
00:37:48,744 --> 00:37:50,677
naquadah能源
To the central tower's primary systems.

908
00:37:50,677 --> 00:37:52,110
虽然只是最少限度修复
Minimal, to be sure, but from there--

909
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:54,177
但是却可以覆盖复制人写的程序
...over-write the replicator program

910
00:37:54,177 --> 00:37:55,210
和重启剩下的系统
And restart the remaining systems.

911
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:56,277
正是
Exactly.

912
00:37:56,277 --> 00:37:58,743
加快吧  现在需要恢复能源
Just hurry. we need power back now.

913
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:00,377
好的  有什么东西我可以帮忙的吗
Okay, is there anything you want me to do?

914
00:38:00,377 --> 00:38:01,510
有的  对新手来说  你可以
Yes, for starters, you could, um,

915
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:03,143
站到一边去
Stay out of my way.

916
00:38:03,143 --> 00:38:06,044
好的  好的
Oh. yes. okay. fine.

917
00:38:11,744 --> 00:38:13,078
还有闭上嘴
And be quiet.

918
00:38:13,078 --> 00:38:14,577
站住!
Stop!

919
00:38:15,577 --> 00:38:16,510
约翰  别过来
John, stay back.

920
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,844
让我来处理吧
Let me handle this.

921
00:38:17,844 --> 00:38:20,644
难道你干的好事还不够多吗
Haven't you done enough already?

922
00:38:20,644 --> 00:38:22,344
我只是想帮忙
I'm trying to help you.

923
00:38:22,344 --> 00:38:24,844
怎么帮  逃跑吗?
By what? escaping?

924
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:26,978
我不知道卡拉森会这样做的
I didn't know that koracen would do this.

925
00:38:26,978 --> 00:38:28,377
她当然知道
Of course she knew!

926
00:38:28,377 --> 00:38:30,510
伊丽莎白由始至终
Elizabeth has been a willing participant

927
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:33,310
都很乐意加入我们的大计
In our goals from the very beginning.

928
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:34,978
混到这里来还是她的主意呢
It was her idea to come here in the first place.

929
00:38:36,811 --> 00:38:39,110
你说过你已经和他们断绝联系了
You said you broke off from them,

930
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,277
他们已经不能跟踪你了
That they couldn't track you.

931
00:38:40,277 --> 00:38:42,544
跟踪她?
Track her?

932
00:38:42,544 --> 00:38:43,877
还是她提醒我们的
She was the one who alerted us

933
00:38:43,877 --> 00:38:46,310
告诉我们时机成熟了的
When the time was right to come.

934
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:48,844
我们只是按她的吩咐办事
We were only following her commands.

935
00:38:48,844 --> 00:38:50,177
约翰  听我说
John, listen to me.

936
00:38:50,177 --> 00:38:51,877
我一定得把他们带来
I had to bring them here.

937
00:38:51,877 --> 00:38:54,210
这是我们唯一的办法
It was our only chance...

938
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:56,410
唯一机会了
Our only way out.

939
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:58,377
我不知道卡拉森
I didn't know that koracen

940
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:00,744
会造成这样的麻烦
Would cause this kind of trouble.

941
00:39:00,744 --> 00:39:02,677
我没有想过要伤害任何人
I didn't think that anyone would get hurt.

942
00:39:02,677 --> 00:39:04,044
那你认为  我们该怎么做呢
What did you think we were going to do?

943
00:39:04,044 --> 00:39:05,811
把复制人的身体都给你
Just give you a bunch of replicator bodies

944
00:39:05,811 --> 00:39:07,344
然后再欢送你走吗
And send you on your way?

945
00:39:07,344 --> 00:39:10,243
我深信  我们并不是你们的威胁
I truly believed that we were no threat to you.

946
00:39:10,243 --> 00:39:11,944
你认为自己还是伊丽莎白
You may still think you're elizabeth,

947
00:39:11,944 --> 00:39:14,243
但你已经不是了
But you're not.

948
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:41,843
如果你想继续未完的工作
If you'd like to resume your work,

949
00:39:42,143 --> 00:39:43,544
我会批准的
I've decided to allow it.

950
00:39:43,544 --> 00:39:46,078
当然  我们会重新开启力场
We would re-engage the force field, of course.

951
00:39:46,078 --> 00:39:47,110
加强保安系统
Beef up security.

952
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:49,677
我太冒险了
It's too risky.

953
00:39:51,011 --> 00:39:53,310
我原以为带他们来这里
I thought that bringing the others here

954
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:54,310
是万无一失的
Would be safe.

955
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:55,744
我错了
I was wrong.

956
00:39:55,744 --> 00:39:57,978
我不能再担保
I can no longer guarantee

957
00:39:57,978 --> 00:40:00,078
他们会不会再制造别的麻烦
There won't be any more trouble from them.

958
00:40:00,078 --> 00:40:01,744
包括我自己
Or even myself.

959
00:40:03,144 --> 00:40:04,911
那好吧
All right, um...

960
00:40:06,211 --> 00:40:07,677
你有什么打算呢
What do you want to do?

961
00:40:10,577 --> 00:40:13,177
我记得在你重新激活我体内的纳米细胞之后
I remember, after you reactivated the nanite cells inside me,

962
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:15,011
我说这个主意糟透了
I said this was a bad idea.

963
00:40:15,011 --> 00:40:17,777
从此之后  所有事都乱套了
So much has gone wrong since then.

964
00:40:20,477 --> 00:40:23,310
但我知道怎样去收拾残局
But I think I know how I can finally set things right.

965
00:40:29,444 --> 00:40:31,844
继续吧
Go ahead.

966
00:40:50,044 --> 00:40:51,444
如果你需要什么帮助
If you need anything else for your work,

967
00:40:51,444 --> 00:40:52,510
告诉我们吧
Let us know.

968
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:53,577
谢谢  罗德尼
Thanks, rodney.

969
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:55,044
你必须再一次向我保证
Once again, you have to promise

970
00:40:55,044 --> 00:40:56,644
在造好人类身体之前
To stay put until you're finished

971
00:40:56,644 --> 00:40:58,410
不能去其他地方
Constructing the human bodies.

972
00:40:58,410 --> 00:40:59,911
不离开你的家园
No leaving your homeworld,

973
00:40:59,911 --> 00:41:02,510
不和亚特兰蒂斯以外的
No communication with any other civilization

974
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:04,177
任何外界联系
Except atlantis.

975
00:41:04,177 --> 00:41:05,310
我向你保证
You have my word.

976
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:07,344
希望你的工作一直顺利  理查德
Good luck with your command, richard.

977
00:41:07,344 --> 00:41:10,711
亚特兰蒂斯能由你这位能者管理  我很欣慰
It's comforting to know atlantis is in capable hands.

978
00:41:11,311 --> 00:41:12,544
谢谢
Thank you.

979
00:41:12,544 --> 00:41:14,344
启程吧
Shall we?

980
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:19,277
没事的
It's okay.

981
00:41:19,277 --> 00:41:21,611
我先来吧
I'll go first.

982
00:41:50,178 --> 00:41:51,944
证实安全
It's safe.

983
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:23,911
你确定重新设置激活程序有用吗
You're sure the dhd reconfiguration worked?

984
00:42:23,911 --> 00:42:25,210
是的
Yes.

985
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,978
他们被送进空间之门去了
They were sent to a space gate.

986
00:42:29,078 --> 00:42:31,844
我想这能够告诉我们她是否真的是伊丽莎白
I guess that answers the question as to whether it was really elizabeth?
