00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:45,210
阿加莎・克里斯汀: 马普尔小姐探案集\N第四季第4集


2
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:27,210
着火了
Fire!

3
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:29,430
着火了
Fire!

4
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:35,400
鲁思
Ruth!

5
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,940
鲁思 发生了什么...
Oh, Ruth, what on earth ...

6
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,670
刘易斯 我的东西
Oh, Lewis! All my things!

7
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,700
- 刘易斯 - 女士们
- Lewis! - Ladies.

8
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:57,210
《借镜杀人》


9
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,720
您的茶 夫人
Your tea, madam.

10
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:09,019
他们理所当然地将火灾归咎于线路故障
Natural, they all put the fire down to a faulty wire,

11
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,829
但我清楚自己看到了什么
but I know what I saw.

12
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,589
有个男人 我现在还能想起他
There was a man. I can see him now.

13
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,410
他...他悄悄穿过走廊
He was...was stilling across the hallway.

14
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,449
他长什么样 鲁思
How would you describe him, Ruth?

15
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:21,629
- 邪恶 邪恶至极 - 我知道了
- Wicked. Quite, quite wicked. - I see.

16
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,979
当然 卡莉・路易斯说我是在做梦
Of course, Carrie Louise says that I dreamed it all,

17
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:28,480
但我姐姐从来都不愿意听不愉快的真相
but my sister never had any time for unpalatable truths.

18
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:32,450
简 你认为有人能猜出
Do you think anyone could possibly guess, Jane,

19
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,620
你我几乎同龄吗
that you and I are practically the same age?

20
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,479
肯定不会
Not for a moment, I'm sure.

21
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,779
我嘛 每分钟都在衰老
I'm afraid, you see, I look every minute of my age.

22
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,180
才不会
No!

23
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,789
这起火灾是何时发生的
When was it, this fire?

24
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,120
六周前
Six weeks ago.

25
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,029
我刚从纽约飞来与受托人见面
I'd just flown in from New York for a meeting of the Trustees.

26
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,799
卡莉・路易斯的丈夫肯定看见了什么
Surely Carrie Louise's husband must have seen something?

27
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:58,159
刘易斯满眼都是他亲爱的妻子和她的事业
Lewis only has eyes for his dear wife and her blessed cause.

28
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,809
她还在追求自己的事业吗
She's still keeping up with her causes?

29
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,670
太阳可不会打西边出来
Does the sun rise in the morning?

30
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:04,430
一般来说 一个年轻姑娘做这件事很时尚
Naturally, such thing is fashionable when one's a young girl.

31
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,439
我记得你当时想做一名修女
You were off to be a nun, I believe.

32
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:09,980
是 很有可能 但婚姻拴住了我
Yes. Very possibly. But marriage knocks sense into one,

33
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,570
天知道自从卡莉・路易斯结婚后
and God knows Carrie Louise has had plenty of practice

34
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:16,850
她付出了多少努力
ever since she threw herself at that luringly glump.

35
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:21,000
她第一任丈夫 古尔布兰德森先生
Her first husband, Mr. Gulbrandsen,

36
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,289
是个慈善家吧
He was something of a philanthropyst, wasn't he?

37
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,400
又结了两次婚 她还在靠他的遗产生活
And two husbands later, she is still living of his inheritance.

38
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,990
现在她又瞄上了新目标
And she's supered herself with this latest cause.

39
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,519
罪犯们
Criminals.

40
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:36,120
她以为自己能和他们"做点什么"
She imagines she can "do something" with them.

41
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,549
所以 他们来了 在她花园尽头
So, there they are, all living it up in a so-called

42
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,669
所谓的"改造工厂"里工作生活
"Reform Facility" at the bottom of her garden.

43
00:03:42,669 --> 00:03:47,250
- 你担心的就是这个吗 - 我不知道
- And this is what you afraid of? - I don't know.

44
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,860
每次我和她在一起 我感觉总有个人在她周围
All the time I was with her, I felt this-this presence around her.

45
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,670
然后...她书房的大火
And then... that fire in her study.

46
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,789
那座房子里的某个人想要伤害我姐姐
Someone in that house wishes my sister harm.

47
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,289
- 我敢说这一切听上去很偏激 - 不
- And I dare say this all sounds quite mad to you. - Oh, no.

48
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,680
- 你相信我吗 - 我相信你的判断
- You believe me? - I trust your conviction.

49
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,459
没有什么事能让你惊奇 对吧 简
Nothing has ever surprised you, has it, Jane?

50
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,990
因为你总是做最坏的打算
Because you always think the worst.

51
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,709
最坏的结果通常会发生
The worst is so often true.

52
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,330
那你会尽快去吧
Then you'll go? As soon as you can?

53
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,539
你记不记得她和古尔布兰德森
Do you remember how she and Gulbrandsen

54
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,730
多么想要一个自己的孩子
longed for a child of their own?

55
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,639
他们不是最终收养了一个吗
Didn't they adopt in the end?

56
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,920
我见过那孩子 非常漂亮的女孩
I think I met the child. A very pretty girl.

57
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:35,970
是的 吉娜 一个迷人的小可爱
Yes. Gina. A bewitching little thing.

58
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,589
然后 如你所料 没过多久
Then, as so often happens, not long after,

59
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,060
卡莉・路易斯发现自己怀孕了
Carrie Louise found herself pregnant.

60
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,209
通常 人们不会善待养子
Normally, it's hard lines on the adopted child,

61
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,820
但他们不同
but not in their case.

62
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,909
卡莉・路易斯生怕自己偏心
Carrie Louise was so anxious not to make the difference between them two

63
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,029
所以米尔德里德出世之后
that when Mildred came along,

64
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,580
任何事她都偏心小吉娜
if anything, she tended to over-indulge the little Gina,

65
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,610
把她的亲生孩子晾在一边
while her natural child was left to fan herself.

66
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,520
可怜的米尔德里德 从未得到过母亲的爱
Poor Mildred. She never stood a chance.

67
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:17,940
- 你好 - 你好
- Hello. - Oh! Hello.

68
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,610
这旅行袋真漂亮
Oh, what a nice trim bag.

69
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:21,719
您一定是...
You must be ...

70
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:24,253
一号站台下一班列车
The next train on platform one 

71
00:05:24,254 --> 00:05:27,619
四点五十从帕丁顿开出
is the 4:50 from Paddington.

72
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,489
明天到达小佩维雷尔
All stations to Little Peverell tomorrow.

73
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,179
您一定是简姑妈
I said you must be Aunt Jane.

74
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,910
- 你一定是吉娜 - 您怎么知道
- And you must be Gina. - How did you guess?

75
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,940
不说也知道 走吧
Don't answer that. Come on.

76
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,940
入此地者将重获希望


77
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:04,909
这一定是那个著名的工厂
This must be the famous facility.

78
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,650
真是不可救药
Incorrigible.

79
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,880
- 你说谁 亲爱的 - 当然是他们
- Who, dear? - Well, them, of course.

80
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,450
妈妈
Mommy!

81
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:25,990
简
Jane!

82
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,639
我亲爱的卡莉・路易斯 你好吗
My dear Carrie Louise. How are you?

83
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:33,580
身体老了 但还是一如既往的固执
The flesh is weak, but the spirit's as stubborn as ever.

84
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,820
你喝茶吗
Would you take tea?

85
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:37,679
我一直站着喝
I always take mine standing up,

86
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:40,260
不然就再也站不起来了 你说呢
or otherwise one would seat around forever, don't you think?

87
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:43,470
请允许我介绍刘易斯
Allow me to introduce Lewis ...

88
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:48,060
我亲爱的丈夫和部落的酋长
treasured husband and chief of my tribe.

89
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,160
- 嗨 - 你好啊
- Ow. - How do you do?

90
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,699
业余爱好 为爱献身
Amateur dramatics. The things we do for love.

91
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:55,050
我觉得你看起来很勇猛
I think you look quite fierce.

92
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:58,700
- 你说呢 亲爱的 - 我不喜欢这种事
- Don't you, dear? - I have no head for such matters.

93
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,980
我女儿 米尔德里德
My daughter. Mildred.

94
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,860
真高兴终于见到你了
How very nice to meet you after this long while.

95
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,280
彼此彼此
Likewise.

96
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,769
我打算将马普尔小姐安置在法比安套房 夫人
I've put Miss Marple in the Fabian Suite, ma'm.

97
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,669
好主意
Good thinking.

98
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,139
简 这是朱丽叶・贝耶维 简直是我的一切
Jane, this is Juliet Bellever, who's simply everything to me,

99
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:19,150

nurse, dragon, watch-dog... and very faithful friend.

100
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,060
乔莉 晚饭吃什么 我饿死了
Jolly! What's for dinner? I'm starved.

101
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:27,569
凯洛格先生认为 食物中额外的蛋白质
As Mr. Kellogg approval, an excess of protein in the diet

102
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:31,069
会激发罪犯的犯罪意识
excites all the wrong instincts amongst with criminal intents

103
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:35,420
我们发现大麦是绝佳的替代品
We found in barley an excelent substitute.

104
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,670
- 是这样吧 马弗里克医生 - 确实
- Isn't that so, Dr. Maverick? - Indeed.

105

我希望我们每周聚餐一次
I like us all to eat together once a week.

106
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,010
想让所有犯人感觉我们是一家人
I like all my charges to feel like they're part of the family.

107
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,120
我们确实是 亲爱的
And so we do, my dear.

108
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,350
他们真般配
They make a splendid couple.

109
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,069
我希望不是
I should hope not!

110
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,999
那是我继子 斯蒂文・雷斯塔瑞克
That's my stepson, Stephen Restarick.

111
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,469

113
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:04,260
在这里万事皆可
All matter of waflles and strays under this roof.

114
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,530
每个人都会犯错
Eveyone's allowed an error of judgement.

115
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,849
爸爸是你的 是吧 亲爱的
Dad was yours. Isn't that right, darling?

116
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,989
有什么好笑的
Not quite a laughing matter.

117
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,110
我妻子在戏剧评论中说斯蒂文是不可或缺的
Steven has made himself indispensible to my wife's dramatic review

118
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,990
卡莉・路易斯让我每年出演她的一部戏
Carrie Louise chooses me to stage a show for her every year.

119
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,770
为了鼓舞军队士气
Moral booster for the troops.

120
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:25,020
你继承父亲的戏剧事业了吗 雷斯塔瑞克先生
Are you in the theater like your father, Mr. Restarick?

121
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:28,000
我从事纺织业
I'm in fabrics,

122

soft furnishing.

00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:31,010
让我不再淘气
Keeps me out of mischief.

124
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,089
但斯蒂维会在春天红透西区
But Stevie is going to storm the West End, in the spring,

125
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,170
是吧 亲爱的
aren't you, darling?

126
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,209
吉娜的丈夫呢
And Gina's husband?

127
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:41,620
一位叫瓦利・哈德的绅士 来自怀俄明
A gentleman called Wally Hudd. From Wyoming.

128
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:45,340

他和吉娜在诺曼底登陆那天相遇 
He and Gina met during D-Day. 

130
00:08:47,774 --> 00:08:48,580
你可以想象那个画面
You can imagine.

131
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,170
正相反 我觉得他们非常般配
On the contrary, I think they're admirably suited.

132
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:54,590
有什么好的战争故事 瓦利
Did you have a good war, Wally?

133
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,390
我没死
Well, it didn't kill me.

134
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,910
但也没变得更坚强
But it didn't make me stronger.

135
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,310
我能帮您吗
May I help you?

136
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,960
不 不
No! No,

137
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:42,980
那场火灾真令人遗憾
such a pity, uh? The fire.

138
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,210
没错
Quite.

139
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,830
几个月之后才恢复元气
Set us back some months.

140
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:52,420
- 我是艾德加・罗森 - 我叫简・马普尔
- Edgar Lawson. - Jane Marple.

141
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,340
我想也是
So I gather.

142
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:59,310
你...为卡莉・路易斯工作吗
Uh... You work for Carrie Louise?

143
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,200
为塞罗科尔德先生
For Mr Serrocold.

144
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,490
我是他的私人秘书
I'm his personal secretary.

145
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:08,450
- 听上去很重要 - 有时是
- Sounds terribly important. - Has its moments.

146
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,980
但...
But...

147
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:16,150
- 我能说个秘密吗 - 当然
- May I speak in confidence? - Of course.

148
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,980
您要发誓
Swear it, please.

149
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:21,229
我不想动摇他的地位
You see, I have no wish to compromise his position.

150
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,090
- 塞罗科尔德先生的吗 - 不
- Mr. Serrocold's? - No.

151
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,280
我父亲的
My father.

152
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:28,370
其实我是
You see, I am, in fact,

153
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,350
温斯顿・丘吉尔的儿子
Winston Churchill's son.

154
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,530
是 看得出来
Yes, I think I do see.

155
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:40,040
他尽其所能帮助我 但他们监视我
He does what he can, but they spy on me.

156
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,750
总是这样
Always have done.

157
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:44,529
还有...政治诽谤运动
And... the whispering campaign.

158
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,440
如果不是这该死的政治诽谤
If it wasn't for that damned whispering, you see?

159
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,629
有谁看见塞罗科尔德夫人了
Has anyone's seen Mrs. Serrocold?

160
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,670
我也奇怪呢
I was thinking the same thing.

161
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,930
这是她这周第二次忘记吃药了
It's the second time this week she forgot her tonic.

162
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,740
这个女人根本不在乎自己的健康
The woman has no head for her own safety.

163
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,930
塞罗科尔德夫人 米尔德里德小姐
Mrs. Serrocold? Miss Mildred?

164
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:04,900
妈妈
Mommy?

165
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:08,890
- 她们在干什么 - 天哪 妈妈
- What is that? - Oh, gosh! Mommy!

166
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,690
妈妈
Mommy!

167
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:14,440
吉娜
Gina!

168
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,149
快回来 你会够不着底的
Come back this minute! You'll be out of your depth!

169
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,820
亲爱的 求求你
Honey, please!

170
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,460
你们也下来吧
Aren't you going to come in?

171
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:24,670
轻轻一跃 清醒一下
A quick leap. Wonderfully refreshing.

172
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:28,180
- 吉娜 - 闭上眼睛
- Gina! - Advert your eyes.

173
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,880
- 你也是 老兄 - 别这么叫我
- You too, bro. - Don't call me that!

174
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,000
你在想什么
What were you thinking of?

175
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,689
斯蒂文碰巧提到
It happens that Stephen mentioned that

176
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,920
潜水能治疗关节炎
a cool dive does wonders for arthritis.

177
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,749
你知道妈妈 总是第一个挑战自己
And you know mommy, always the first to the barricade.

178
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,509
- 但她几乎不会游泳 - 瞎说
- But she can hardly swim! - Oh, nonsense.

179
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,940
救命 救命
Help! Help!

180
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:02,289
现在高兴了 今天的混乱还不够多吗
Happy now? Caused sufficient chaos for one night?

181
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,429
别说了 蜜儿
Give me a rest, Mil.

182
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,589
我来了 我来了
I'm coming! I'm coming!

183
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,910
小心 刘易斯 水很深
Careful, Lewis, it does get deep there.

184
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:10,179
我来了 坚持住
I'm coming! Hang on!

185
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:13,330
你怎么想 马普尔小姐 脑子犯抽了吧
What do they say, Miss Marple? Blood ran out?

186
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,870
塞罗科尔德先生会游泳吗
Is he an able swimmer, Mr Serrocold?

187
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,900
这儿就没个人真的会游泳吗
Can anyone here actually swim?

188
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,027
受不了了 你们就会光说不练
Very good, low lovers,

189
00:12:23,028 --> 00:12:24,769
我一个人去救他们 就算死了也算试过了
I'll rescue them myself or die trying.

190
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,548
你开玩笑吧
You won't do that.

191
00:12:25,549 --> 00:12:26,510
吉娜 你不许下去
Gina, don't you dare!

192
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:29,940
米尔德里德  那些小伙子是什么人
I say, Mildred, who are those young men?

193
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:37,240
看来你的祈祷管用了 蜜儿
Looks like your prayers were answered, Mil.

194
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,493
亲爱的鲁思 我希望能够对你说
My dear Ruth, i had hoped to 

195
00:12:43,494 --> 00:12:46,560
你担心卡莉・路易斯的人身安全
dispel your concerns 

196
00:12:46,561 --> 00:12:47,480
完全是杞人忧天
over Carrie Louise's safety,

197
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,910
但是恐怕事与愿违
but I fear I can not.

198
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,510
她还是像以前那样开朗阳光
She has the same bright spirit as ever,

199
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:56,059
但正如你先前所暗示的那样
but there may, as you suggested,

200
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:59,780
斯托尼盖特可能真的暗潮涌动
be dark forces at play here in Stonygates.

201
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,850
吉娜正如你描述的那样迷人
Gina is as bewitching as you say.

202
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:05,320
家中的继子 
Certainly, the stepson, 

203
00:13:05,321 --> 00:13:08,280
斯蒂文・雷斯塔瑞克也发现了这一点
Stephen Restarick, finds her so,

204
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:13,130
但她的丈夫却对这一切视若无睹 漠不关心
while her american husband looks away, as if indifferent.

205
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,710
还有艾德加・罗森
And then there is Edgar Lawson.

206
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,730
他与周围格格不入
He is maladjusted, certainly.

207
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,720
除此之外 艾德加・罗森还有一点不对劲
But there is something else a little wrong about Edgar Lawson.

208
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,160
但这跟卡莉・路易斯有什么关系 
There what is, and it is and when it touches Carrie Louise,

209
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,620
我还说不好
I can not yet say.

210
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,590
那件事一定吓到你了
It must have been a terrible shock for you. 

211
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,239
我是指 那场火灾
The fire, I mean.

212
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,171
我书房的那次吗
In my study? 

213
00:14:10,172 --> 00:14:12,510
没那回事 只是场意外
Oh, no, no. That was an accident.

214
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,610
只是
It's just ...

215
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,861
这件事千万不要
Promise you won't breathe a word 

216
00:14:14,862 --> 00:14:17,500
让可怜的刘易斯知道 但是...
of this to my poor Lewis, but ...

217
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:20,090
我的英雄
Oh, the hero of the hour!

218
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,371
阿尔巴特・安东尼
Albator, Anthony!

219
00:14:22,372 --> 00:14:23,440
夫人
Madam.

220
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,609
八次盗窃 四次入侵民宅
Eight cons for burglary, four for breaking and entering,

221
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,869
还有更多我数都数不过来的罪行
and more gravous harm than I have fingers and toes to count,

222
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,579
但是昨天晚上 这位绅士救了我的命
but last night, this gentleman saved my life.

223
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:34,099
虽然场面挺狼狈的
All it takes is a little dignity,

224
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:36,540
还得跟内政局解释才行
though try and say that to the Home Office.

225
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,689
这位是惠特斯特布尔・欧尼斯特
And this is Whitstable Ernest.

226
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,279
你的西红柿长势好吗
How are your tomatoes prospering?

227
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:41,620
都熟透了 夫人
Ripe as prune, ma'am.

228
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,890
想尝一个吗 夫人
Care to try one, madam?

229
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:45,740
好的 谢谢
Very nice. Thank you.

230
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,549
塞罗科尔德先生现在恢复了吧
Mr. Serrocold's fully recovered from his paddle, I hope?

231
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,640
好多了 今早乘头班车去伦敦了
Oh, quite. Off to London in the first train this morning.

232
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:52,628
是生意上的事吧
Business, I expect.

233
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:53,389
没错
That's right.

234
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,799
欧尼斯特一度对金融很有兴趣
Ernest once took a great interest in finantial matters.

235
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:59,299
就是有点过头了 是吧 夫人
Yes, got a bit ahead of myself, didn't I, ma'am?

236
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:01,829
他曾未经人同意就拿别人的钱投资
He used to invest other people's money without their permission.

237
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,949
看得出来 你是个园艺能手
You have green fingers, I see.

238
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,260
谢谢夸奖 很高兴能派上用场
Thank you. And happily free to use them.

239
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,120
这里湖光山色 还有这么漂亮的园子
Lakeside view, a excellent piece of garden.

240
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,780
没有比这更好的休闲地点了
Can't think a more pleasant place to telax on.

241
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:15,870
你这么一说 我都想加入你们了
Put like that, I feel I might join you.

242
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,240
这边的大门永远都是敞开的
Well, there's always room for one more.

243
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:21,420
塞罗科尔德太太
Mrs. Serrocold?

244
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:22,509
乔莉什么事
Jolly?

245
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,549
有一位绅士要见您
There's a gentleman to see you.

246
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,960
我马上就来
I'll be along in a moment.

247
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,750
克里斯提安
Christian!

248
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:39,352
不是你想见的人对吧
Not whom you were expecting?

249
00:15:39,353 --> 00:15:41,010
我不知道你要来
I didn't know.

250
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,460
你还是老样子 总是神神秘秘的
Wrapped as you were, in such mistery!

251
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,211
胡说 我昨晚跟刘易斯说过了
Nonsense. I told Lewis last night.

252
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:47,609
他没告诉你吗
Didn't he tell you?

253
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,799
也许吧
Oh, perhaps he did.

254
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:51,540
我让乔莉给你安排奇尔・哈迪的房间
I'll get Jolly to prepare Kier Hardie's room.

255
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:52,949
简 很抱歉
Oh, Jane, I'm so sorry.

256
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,729
我来跟你介绍克里斯提安 
Allow me to present Christian.

257
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,286
我的另一个继子 
My other stepson, 

258
00:15:56,287 --> 00:15:58,799
他父亲是我已故的第一任丈夫
by way of my late and beloved first husband.

259
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,109
我明白了 虽然有点复杂
I see. Well, I think I do.

260
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,049
女士
Madam.

261
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,990
我希望你这次不会那么快离开
I hope you don't deserting us too soon this time.

262
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,279
至少呆到周末好吗
At least stay for the weekend?

263
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:09,950
我来这儿是打算跟刘易斯谈事情的
I was hoping to have a word with Lewis.

264
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:15,339
都是生意上的事 很乏味的
Business matter. All very tedious.

265
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,690
他现在不在 那你干脆愉快地留下吧
Well, he's not here, so you'll jolly have to wait!

266
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:19,710
恭敬不如从命
So much the better.

267
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,370
来 我们带你看看园子去
Come, let us show you the garden.

268
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,440
今天天气多好啊
Such a lovely day.

269
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,610
他们应该跟我商量一下的
They might have consulted me.

270
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:32,140
罗森先生
Mr. Lawson!

271
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,800
我是塞罗科尔德先生的私人秘书
I'm Mr. Serrocold's p-personal secretary,

272
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,889
所以 如果事情真的这么紧急
so, Gulbrandsen should have come to me,

273
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,477
古尔布兰德森应该来问我的
if it's all so urgent.

274
00:16:38,478 --> 00:16:39,200
没错
Indeed.

275
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,900
他们把我当傻瓜
They take me for a fool.

276
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:45,260
但是我已经知道了 那才是重点
But I know. That's the point.

277
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,430
你知道什么
What do you know?

278
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:49,820
他是恶魔附身
He has the devil in him.

279
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:54,239
谁 古尔布兰德森先生还是...你父亲
Who? Mr. Gulbrandsen or... your father?

280
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,279
你等着瞧吧
Just you wait and see.

281
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:56,660
别烦她
Leave her alone.

282
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,550
你在监视我吗
Spying on me?

283
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,380
看不出这位老夫人想安静会儿吗 快走开
Can't you see the old dame wants some peace? Go on and splt.

284
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,060
这就走
Gladly.

285
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:12,260
你手上拿的是咖啡吗
Is that coffee you have there?

286
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,739
能给我喝一点吗 压压惊
Perhaps you could spare a drop. My nerves!

287
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,246
这咖啡很浓
I make it pretty strong.

288
00:17:16,247 --> 00:17:18,260
我就喜欢喝浓咖啡
Well, that's the way I like it.

289
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:24,239
来一杯乔[咖啡] 你们美国人是这么说的吗
A cup of Joe. Isn't that the way you Americans call it?

290
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,080
还只是电影里这么演
Or is that just for the pictures?

291
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:28,780
我有时候很好奇
You know, I sometimes wonder 

292
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:31,889
乔到底是个人 还是什么东西
who or what Joe is.

293
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:36,759
不管他是谁 但愿上帝保佑他
Well ... God bless him, whoever he is.

294
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:38,030
干杯
Cheers.

295
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,800
每当从这儿看出去 看到这些景象
You know, when I look out, on all this, 

296
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,039
我就有点想念我的紫菀园
I begin to feel a little homesick for my asters.

297
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:51,390
我也有同感
You and me, both.

298
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,409
你也种紫菀吗
You have asters?

299
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,030
不是 我...
Oh, no, I... hmm.

300
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:58,063
你是指思乡
Homesick.

301
00:17:58,064 --> 00:17:59,350
是的
Yeah.

302
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,809
思乡只有一种解药
Well, there's only one known cure for that.

303
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,299
小公主才不会懂这些
Try telling that to princess.

304
00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:06,299
我能给她什么呢
What have I got to give her?

305
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:16,340
你好 这里是斯托尼盖特
Hello. Stonygates.

306
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:19,000
很好 先生
Very good, sir.

307
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,220
不用了 我已经通知过园丁了
There's no need. I've already indormed the groundsman.

308
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:25,430
我会亲自确认的 再见
I'll see to it myself. Goodbye.

309
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,855
是塞罗科尔德先生吗
Was that Mr. Serrocold?

310
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:28,830
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

311
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,789
他会如预计的四点二十七分到家
He'll be home in the 04:27, as planned.

312
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:35,799
也许我可以开车去车站接他
Perhaps I might drive up and meet him from the station?

313
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:37,450
他想走着回来
He prefers to walk.

314
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:41,360
很好 贝耶维小姐
Very good ... Miss Bellever.

315
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,630
我去看看晚饭准备好了没
I should see about dinner.

316
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:46,580
马普尔小姐
Miss Marple.

317
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,680
古尔布兰德森先生
Oh! Mr. Gulbrandsen!

318
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:52,140
我刚想去休息一会
Just off for a little lie down.

319
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,940
那么别因为我搅了您的雅兴
Well, don't let me keep you.

320
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,489
马普尔小姐 您已经认识卡莉・路易斯...
Miss Marple, you've known Carrie-Louise ...

321
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,849
大半辈子了 真是难以置信啊
Oh, most of my life, would you believe?

322
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,400
你觉得她怎么样
How do you find her?

323
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,459
永远的理想主义者
As great an idealist as ever.

324
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:07,440
也许是因为
Maybe she does not 

325
00:19:07,441 --> 00:19:12,170
她还没有领教过世事的残酷
appreciate the evil there is in the world

326
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,040
跟我说说 她健康情况如何
Tell me, how is her health?

327
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,010
我看起来觉得挺好
She seems to me well enough.

328
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,799
就是有点关节炎
Appart from the arthritis.

329
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:21,110
她的心脏呢
And her heart?

330
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:23,320
她的心脏够强壮吗
Is her heart strong?

331
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,850
很强壮 古尔布兰德森先生
As far as one can tell, Mr Gulbrandsen.

332
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,670
晚饭时再见
Until supper time.

333
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:33,800
祝您睡眠愉快
Enjoy your... shut eye.

334
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:19,470
希望卡莉・路易斯不会知道...
Let's hope to spare Carrie Louise from knowledge ...

335
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,580
如果她太激动的话...因为她...
If it could be carried away from her... because of her ...

336
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:33,720
不是吧
Oh, dear.

337
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:44,690
就是这样 不 不 不 继续往那边
That's it. No, no, no, keep going.

338
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,620
往中间一点 就是那儿
More into the center. Left in there.

339
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,400
再往前点
Further.

340
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,430
抱歉 姑娘
Sorry, old girl.

341
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:55,830
蜜儿 我还以为你不喜欢这种事呢
Oh, Mil! I thought you didn't approve of such things.

342
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,902
万事都有头一回嘛
Try anything once.

343
00:20:57,903 --> 00:20:58,819
大概吧
I bet.

344
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:02,130
克里斯提安 我希望你能留下来看彩排
Christian, I hope you'll stay for the dress rehearsal.

345
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,050
我有点累了
I'm a little weary.

346
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:09,610
能送纸和打印机到我房间吗
Could I have some paper and a typewriter brought up to my room?

347
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,499
当然可以 贝耶维小姐
Of course. Miss Bellever?

348
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:12,990
我马上去办
I'll see to it at once.

349
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:16,979
多美好啊 我们大家齐聚一个屋檐下
How nice. All of us together under the same roof.

350
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:18,200
没错
Yes.

351
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:52,600
要是还有什么我能帮上忙的...
Oh, if there's anything more I can do ...

352
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:55,309
你好好坐着 等下配合入戏就好了
You sit tight and weep like a black sheep.

353
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,199
好吧
Oh. All right.

354
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:58,270
准备好了吗
All set?

355
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:01,870
还没到你出场呢
Ooh! That's not your cue!

356
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,940
可我已经出来了 那就开始吧
Well, I'm here now. Let's go on with it. 

357
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,670
说话专业点
Spoken like a "pro".

358
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,499
夫人 你忘了你的奎宁水了
Madam, you forgot your tonic.

359
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:11,340
等一等
Oh, hang on.

360
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,789
这活儿一般是我来干的
I normally do this.

361
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,940
不好意思 亲爱的 我都忘了
I'm sorry, my darling. I've quite forgotten.

362
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,210
没关系的
Oh! It doesn't matter.

363
00:22:20,211 --> 00:22:21,509
手滑了
Butter fingers.

364
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,639
没事的 刘易斯 真的 小事情
It doesn't matter, Lewis. Really, it's not important.

365
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:26,120
没关系 乔莉 拿下去 我等会儿再喝
Never mind, Jolly, put it down. I'll take it later.

366
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:29,498
我想起来了 马普尔小姐
Oh, I wonder, Miss Marple?

367
00:22:29,499 --> 00:22:30,279
什么事
What?

368
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:32,750
你可不可以...
I wonder, if you wouldn't mind...

369
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,610
我好像没带眼镜
W-well, I don- I don't seem to have my glasses.

370
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,559
你头上不就是吗
On your head?

371
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,999
是的
No. Oh! Yes, it is.

372
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:39,380
大家都等着呢
Hang on with it!

373
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,740
我跋山涉水...
I have travelled far and wide ...

374
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,910
来...
.. to ...

375
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:02,770
我想应该是"来膜拜你"
I believe it's "to hail you".

376
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,099
"来膜拜你..."
"to hail you ..."

377
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:08,499
来膜拜你...我们部落最伟大的神明
To hail you... to the great gods of our tribe.

378
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:09,389
饶了我吧
Dear me.

379
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,820
他们说 我 伟大的族长
They say that I, Big Chief Running Bear,

380
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:19,140
必须为了我的所爱 勇敢起来
must brave all ... for the love of my dear.

381
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,418
应该是"第三个也是最好的" 刘易斯
"Third and finest", Lewis?

382
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:21,990
什么
What?

383
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,300
第三个也是最好的
Third and finest.

384
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:26,240
没错 抱歉 抱歉
Oh! Oh, quite. Sorry. Sorry.

385
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,430
为了我第三个也是最好的妻子 夏日雨
My third and finest squaw, Summer Rain.

386
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:34,150
吉娜 你看起来太可爱了
Oh, Gina, you look lovely!

387
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,150
神哪
Good grief!

388
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:50,780
我们开始了
Here we go.

389
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:55,869
她美丽的眼睛 是欢欣的所在
Her beauties eyes most pleasantly framed.

390
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:59,130
太棒了 你太有才了 斯蒂维
Oh, bravo! Most eloquent, Stevie.

391
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:01,060
艾德加 艾德加
Edgar? Edgar!

392
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:02,720
坐下
Sit down.

393
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:07,276
怎么又这样
Oh! Not again! 

394
00:24:07,277 --> 00:24:08,249
电路故障
Wires on the blink.

395
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:11,260
- 我去检查保险丝 - 好样的 瓦利
- I'll go and check the fuse box. - Good man, Wally.

396
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,600
现在做什么
Well, what now?...

397
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,240
我们可以继续吗 大师
Shall we carry on, maestro, or er ...?

398
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:22,550
- 当心点 - 看路 艾迪
- Careful! - Steady, Eddie!

399
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:25,680
- 有什么问题吗 艾德加 - 你还敢问我
- Something wrong, Edgar? - You dare to ask me that?

400
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,619
- 别装得事不关己... - 他有枪
- Calm as you like, when... - He's got a gun!

401
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:30,109
- 只是个玩具 - 他在演戏
- It's just a toy. - He's playing.

402
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,710
我引起你们的注意了吧 大家都注意了
I've got your attention, everybody? Everybody focused?

403
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:35,469
别玩了 老兄 今晚的演出够多了
Come on, old man, it's enough theatrics for one night.

404
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,240
我要知道真相 我要剩下的人作证
I want the truth! And I want you all by witness.

405
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,657
# 见证人 见证人 # 
By witness, by witness 

406
00:24:40,658 --> 00:24:41,799
别弹了 我是认真的
Be quiet, I'm serious.

407
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:43,440
斯蒂文 你别捣乱了
Stephen, that really isn't helping!

408
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:46,070
你吓到我们了
Ok, you're scaring us now.

409
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:49,409
看看你 可怜巴巴地站在那
Look at you! Just standing, you're pathetic!

410
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,749
谁去把瓦利叫来
Will somebody please, get Wally?

411
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,250
围着你的怪念头瞎忙活
Chasing your every whim  your every whim ...

412
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,339
他把门给锁了
He's gone and locked the bloody door!

413
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,979
把枪放下 艾德加
Put the gun down, Edgar.

414
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:57,405
点头哈腰 赔笑脸 
A nod here, a smile there, 

415
00:24:57,406 --> 00:24:59,449
"谢谢您 塞罗科尔德先生"
"Thank you, Mr Serrocold!"

416
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,790
艾德加
Edgar!

417
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:02,349
"要多少糖 塞罗科尔德先生"
"How many sugars, Mr Serrocold?"

418
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,149
"茶够甜了吗 塞罗科尔德先生"
"Tea, sweet enough for you, Mr Serrocold?"

419
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,959
- 谁快阻止他 - 别犯傻 他无恶意
- Somebody do something! - Don't be silly. He's harmless.

420
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:08,279
你怎么知道
How can you say that?

421
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:09,979
别站在那光说话
Don't you just stand there, with your mouth.

422
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:11,069
把枪给我
Give me that gun!

423
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,500
- 都别动 - 罗森先生
- Nobody move! - Mr. Lawson.

424
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,469
你不觉得进来更舒服些吗
Don't you think that you might be more comfortable inside?

425
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,770
都别动
Nobody move!

426
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:24,599
一直以来都是你窃窃私语 两面三刀
All this time it was you, the whispering, the plotting!

427
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:28,219
- 艾德加 别发疯了 - 你答应会帮我的
- Edgar, please,this is madness. - You promised to help me!

428
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:30,610
- 艾德加 够了 - 还要骗我
- Edgar, enough! - More to fool me, hey?

429
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:33,470
谁都不相信 至少不信你们这帮...
Never trust anyone, at least not in this den of...

430
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,070
瞧你们
Look at you!

431
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,629
你们都该送去改造
They ought to send a lot of you out of this precious little fecility

432
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,760
看你们怎么...
and see how you...

433
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,180
我说了别动
I told you not to move!

434
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:43,870
- 过来 过来 - 没事了 艾德加
- Come here! Come here! - It's all right, Edgar.

435
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:45,789
- 跪下 跪下 - 我不会伤害你的
- On your knees! On your knees! - I'm not going to hurt you.

436
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,850
跪下
On your knees!

437
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,030
刘易斯
Lewis!

438
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:55,460
好疼啊
That hurt!

439
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:58,030
抓到你了 快放下枪 放下枪
Got you! Come on, drop it, drop it!

440
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:01,557
好了 闹剧结束了 
There we are. The Show is over! 

441
00:26:01,558 --> 00:26:02,710
艾德加 钥匙拿来
Edgar! The key.

442
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,229
只是小打小闹 是吧
Not exactly a big game, is it?

443
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,850
我看他就是欺软怕硬的主
But I suppose you can always try boiling him over to a stop.

444
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:11,669
- 父亲 - 斯蒂文
- Father? - Stephen!

445
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,779
他来这干嘛
What's he doing here?

446
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:15,150
刘易斯・塞罗科尔德 很高兴见到你 老兄
Lewis Serrocold? Glad to meet you, old man.

447
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:19,570
艾德加 下次再这样 直接去找马弗里克医生
Oh, Edgar, whatever next? Search for Dr. Maverick, will you?

448
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:20,629
谁开枪了
Did I hear gunshots?

449
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,235
你一定是... 
So you must be... 

450
00:26:22,236 --> 00:26:24,470
大首领约翰尼・雷斯塔瑞克
Big Chief Johnny Restarick.

451
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,369
刚从苏豪区和加里克的猎场乘兴而来
Fresh from the happy hunting grounds of Soho and Garrick.

452
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:31,070
女主人的前任枕边人
And former tenant of the great white bed.

453
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:34,320
能来点润喉的吗 老兄
Any chance of something moist in a glass, old man?

454
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:35,960
当然
Why not?

455
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:40,880
瞧你 我的波提切利天使
Ha! Look at you, my Botticelli angel!

456
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,289
我们要报警
We have to call the police.

457
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,960
没必要 艾德加也平静下来了
Oh! There's no need to fuss. Edgar is quite himself again.

458
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,840
刘易斯也没事 是吧 亲爱的
And Lewis is fine. Aren't you, darling?

459
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,260
我说的不是塞罗科尔德先生
It wasn't Mr. Serrocold I was thinking of.

460
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:16,040
他总是很注重仪表
He was always so precise about his appearance.

461
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:25,200
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

462
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:29,740
谁会如此狠毒
How could anyone do such a thing?

463
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:34,499
抱歉 卡莉・路易斯 但你知道
Forgive me, Carrie Louise, but had you any idea that

464
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:37,760
今晚你前夫会来吗
your former husband was coming to Stonygates tonight?

465
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,490
约翰尼
Johnny?

466
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,760
是的 你怎么知道
Yes. How did you know?

467
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,770
早些 亲爱的 我们在温室旁时
Earlier, dear, when we were near the glasshouse,

468
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,319
你试图告诉我你的烦恼
you tried to tell me what was troubling you.

469
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:48,420
是这样的...
Yes, you see...

470
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:52,710
约翰尼总是像追求者一样
..Johnny kept writing me these long letters,

471
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,010
给我写情书
like some supplicant at the gate,

472
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:57,830
如果我拒绝他 他就没完
threatening to end it all, if I turned him away.

473
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,480
- 你给过他希望吗 - 绝没有
- And you gave him hope? - Never!

474
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,860
但天知道刘易斯会怎么想
Though heaven knows what Lewis will make of it.

475
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:06,349
每当他在报纸上看到约翰尼的名字
He gets into the most deadful huff

476
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,360
他都会吃干醋
if he so much sees Johnny's name in the newspaper.

477
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:17,990
- 塞罗科尔德夫人 - 请进
- Mrs. Serrocold? - Do come in.

478
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,150
克里探长 夫人 这是我的助理莱克警官
Inspetor Curry, ma'm. My assistent, sargeant Lake.

479
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:30,510
- 死者是你的继子吧 - 是的
- Your stepson, I gather. - That's right.

480
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:32,829
是我已故第一任丈夫的儿子
About my late first husband.

481
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:36,660
这么晚了还发生这可怕的噩耗
Dreadful shock, a bit of a late night, I imagine.

482
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:40,230
简・马普尔 塞罗科尔德夫人的朋友
Jane Marple. Friend of Mrs. Serrocold.

483
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,500
给夫人搬个椅子来 警官
Chair for the lady, Sargeant.

484
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:55,470
先讲我了解到的情况
So... let's see if I got this straight.

485
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,470
死者今天到达来找你丈夫 
The deceased arrived today 

486
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:01,570
刘易斯・塞罗科尔德先生
on a pressing matter of business

487
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:04,070
商讨生意上的要紧事
with your husband, Mr. Lewis Serrocold.

488
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:09,000
死者用过少许晚餐后 回房休息
The deceased then retired to his room after a light supper,

489
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:12,630
然后背部被刺...
where he was stabbed in the back...

490
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:15,469
与此同时 其他人都被锁在楼下客厅
..while the rest of the company were busy downstairs,locked

491
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:20,469
看戏剧表演 其间艾德加・罗森先生
in the drawing room, for a theatrical performance that went a riot

492
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,620
出来闹过事
on account of a Mr... Edgar Lawson.

493
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,779
是这样的
That's correct.

494
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:30,019
那个你无需担心 探长先生 是一段小插曲
Nothing to concern you there, inspector. A momentary aberration.

495
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:32,760
艾德加・罗森是你这里的犯人之一吗
One of your convicts, hey, this Edgar Lawson?

496
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:35,200
- 什么意思 - 他是什么人
- What of it? - What's he in for?

497
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,410
明白了
Oh, I see.

498
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,400
艾德加只是幻想
Edgar rather pressed his atention 

499
00:29:39,401 --> 00:29:42,280
他和社会名流有关系
on one or two pillars of

500
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:46,719
丘吉尔先生 蒙哥马利子爵等等 
society. Mr. Churchill... Viscount Montgomery, and so on...

501
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:50,060
他和我们在一起两年了 已经有了很大的进步
He's been with us two years. He's made great strides.

502
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:51,869
他可以进入枪械室吗
And he had access to the gun room?

503
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,415
艾德加是我丈夫的私人助理 
Edgar is my husband's personal secretary. 

504
00:29:54,416 --> 00:29:55,430
我明白了
I see.

505
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,959
我们经常会雇佣劳教人员
From time to time, we employ individuals from the facility.

506
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:01,470
承担更多的责任使他们受益
Those who'd benefict from added responsability.

507
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,210
罗森先生现在在哪
Where is he now, this Mr. Lawson?

508
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:08,060
睡了 马弗里克医生给他打了镇定剂
Asleep. Dr. Maverick sedated him.

509
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:11,710
- 其他犯人呢 - 在安全的宵禁
- And were the other convicts? - Safely under curfew.

510
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:17,199
庄园的所有大门 下午五点会准时锁上
All the gates of the property are locked at 05:00PM sharp.

511
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:18,190
当然
Of course.

512
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:25,360
这个...就是杀人凶器了
This er... would be the murder weapon, then.

513
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:28,770
像是军用的
Military flavour.

514
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:29,739
认识吗
Familiar at all?

515
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:34,480
它是...曾是瓦利・哈德先生的
It belonged... belongs to a Mr. Wally Hudd.

516
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:37,020
美国军用刀
US... Army knife.

517
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:40,360
那个去外面修电路的美国人吗
The American who left the locked room to fix the wire?

518
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,540
他把刀放在自己房里
He kept that knife in his room.

519
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:46,159
谁都有可能拿走它
Absolutely anybody could have taken it.

520
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:50,310
我想现场证据我们收集得差不多了
I think we've cleaned as much as we can from the crime scene.

521
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:00,530
让吉娜到我房里去
I'd like Gina to see me to my room.

522
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,200
吉娜小姐
Miss Gina!

523
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:07,450
探长先生 抱歉
Oh, Inspector. I'm sorry.

524
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:11,170
我对这台打字机很好奇 
I did wonder... The typewriter.

525
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:15,630
它是帝国好伴侣牌的
Uh...It's an Imperial Good Companion

526
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,089
除非是我糊涂了 
Unless I have my evenings muddled, I...

527
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:21,850

但我记得去世的古尔布兰德森先生
I seem to recall that late Mr. Gulbrandsen

528
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:26,240
要求过把打印机和纸送到这房间
requested a typewriter and paper to be brought up to this room?

529
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,690
是的 没错
Yes, that's right.

530
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,940
这就让我很奇怪
It struck me as a little odd,

531
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:35,390
既然他要写信件
one would imagine he wished to write correspondence,

532
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:39,600
为什么 这里什么都没有
only...it doesn't appear to be any.

533
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:44,410
- 贝耶维小姐 - 之前的确有封信在这
- Miss Bellever? - As a matter of fact, there was a letter.

534
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:47,039
我想我说过谁都不能动现场
I thought I told no one to tuch a thing.

535
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:48,190
谁还来过这 
Who was up in here? 

536
00:31:48,191 --> 00:31:50,330
只有刘易斯・塞罗科尔德先生
Only Mr. Lewis Serrocold.

537
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,640
非常好
Very good.

538
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:55,613
谢谢 多谢 您是... 
Thank you. Thank you, Miss hum... 

539
00:31:55,614 --> 00:31:56,889
马普尔 不客气
Marple. Quite welcome.

540
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:00,120
- 还察觉到什么吗 - 没特别的了
- Anything else up your sleeve? - Not especially.

541
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:02,949
当然还有一件小事
Just a little thing, of course,

542
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,809
较早之前我和古尔布兰德森先生谈过话
but after my conversation with Mr. Gulbrandsen earlier in the day

543
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,658
你和受害者说过话吗
You spoke with the victim? 

544
00:32:08,659 --> 00:32:10,330
只是简单交流了下
Only briefly, I'm affraid.

545
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,720
但他说了些不寻常的话
But he said something rather unusual.

546
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:16,240
他询问过卡莉・路易斯的健康问题
He asked out of Carrie Louise's health.

547
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:18,509
"她的心脏是否强壮"
"Is her heart strong?"

548
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,530
- 她的心脏 - 这是他的原话
- Her heart? - Those were his words.

549
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:23,199
他是什么意思呢
What did he mean by that?

550
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:27,049
或许刘易斯・塞罗科尔德更了解
Peraps Lewis Serrocold can shed more light on the matter.

551
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:30,060
今晚他们在公园里聊了天
They were having a talk this evening in the park.

552
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,760
我凑巧瞄了眼窗外
I just happened to be looking out of my window.

553
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,560
你是个查案老手 是吧 马普尔小姐
You are not new to this game, are you, Miss.. Marple..?

554
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,680
看看这个
Look at this.

555
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,385
"我 大首领酋长
"I, Big Chief Running Bear, 

556
00:32:43,386 --> 00:32:46,910
必须为我所爱 勇往直前..."
must brave all for the love of..."

557
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,899
谁写的这傻东西
Who wrote this drivel?

558
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:51,560
其实是我写的
I did, as a matter of fact.

559
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,619
不用担心 给我一只笔
Ah, not to worry. Gimme a pencil,

560
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:55,579
看我怎样把它化腐朽为神奇
we'll see if we can turn this around.

561
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:59,009
不 这剧本很好 不用你操心
No! We're very good as we are, thanks all the same.

562
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:02,650
- 我觉得也还好 - 那我认错了
- I think it's jolly good. -Well, I stand corrected.

563
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,160
我们该睡觉了吧
Oh, hello, is that the time?

564
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:08,749
我说 你可以给以前的老伙计
I say, you couldn't free the Oktober Suite

565
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,619
施舍间房吧
for a former comrade, could you?

566
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:14,009
- 不能睡这里 - 没得选择 老兄
- He's not sleeping in here. - No choice, old man.

567
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:16,920
- 警察的命令 - 好吧
- Copper's orders. - Very well.

568
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:21,030
我们的贫民窟里还是有房间可以招待的
I dare say that we can accomodate the gentleman in Skid Row.

569
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:22,139
这才够意思嘛
That's more like is.

570
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:25,419
贝耶维小姐 把我们的客人带去劳教工厂
Miss Bellever, will you deliver our guest to the facility?

571
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:26,480
谢谢 什么
Thank you... What?!

572
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:31,570
我相信那里的房间会满足你的需要
I'm sure you'll find the accomodation adequate to your needs.

573
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:44,510
两件事都没错
Quite correct on both counts.

574
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:47,940
晚饭前我和克里斯提安谈过
Christian and I did speak before dinner.

575
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:52,410
打字机上也的确有信
And there was indeed a letter in the typewriter.

576
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:55,200
信在我这
Ah!... I have it with me now.

577
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:58,099
我很鄙视随便动我证物的人
I take a dim view, sir, of those who tamper with my evidence.

578
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,290
当然
Of course you do.

579
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:04,330
但我知道我妻子会去看她继子的遗体
But you see, I knew my wife wanted to view her late stepson's body,

580
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:09,270
我不想让她瞥见信的内容
and if she got a glimpse to... letter's contents...

581
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,180
听起来很严重啊 先生
All sounds very grave, sir.

582
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,469
生意上的事有什么...
Why a matter of businees could be so...

583
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,109
跟生意上的事没关系
It has nothing to do with business!

584
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:17,180
- 你们是同事 - 某种程度上是
- Well, you were colleagues. - In some way.

585
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,907
克里斯提安・古尔布兰德森和我
Christian Gulbrandsen was a fellow Trustee 

586
00:34:20,908 --> 00:34:22,729
还有我妻子的妹妹
of his late father's estate

587
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:25,129
是他父亲遗产的受托人
together with myself and my wife's sister,

588
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:27,589
鲁思・凡・赖多克 她很有商业头脑
Ruth van Rydock. A sound head for business.

589
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,209
总之 我管理日常资金的运转
Anyway I take care of day-to-day running.

590
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:32,140
我懂点审计
I have a background in auditiing.

591
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:34,409
我们三个至少每年见一面
The three of us like to meet,

592
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:37,840
一起查账
at least once a year, to keep an eye on the accounts.

593
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,812
上一次我们见的时候
When we last met, 

594
00:34:39,813 --> 00:34:43,400
克里斯提安说了一些他的担忧
Christian outlined some concerns ....

595
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:47,319
但他比以前都谨慎 在没查清真相之前
Mas, ever cautious, he did not round to specifics,

596
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:48,569
他没有透露具体的细节
not until he made inquiries.

597
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:52,230
他想确定了再说 而今晚...
He wanted to be sure, you see. And tonight...

598
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:56,000
他终于说出了真相
..He finally confessed the truth.

599
00:34:56,120 --> 00:35:00,900
我们决定 他需要马上写信给鲁思征求意见
We agreed that he should write to Ruth at once and seek her advice.

600
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:03,550
就是这个 你看吧
There, there! Read it.

601
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:09,390
"亲爱的鲁思
"Dear Ruth ...

602
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,160
我们将要面对一场严重的危机
.. A crisis of extraordinary gravity has risen

603
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,119
我迷失其中 不知如何应对"
and I'm at a lost in how to deal with it. "

604
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:20,240
"我了解你对卡莉・路易斯有深切的感情
"I know how your deep affection is for Carrie Louise,

605
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:23,860
你关心一切会影响到她的事物
how grave your concern for anything that affects her.

606
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,879
直接了当地说 我有理由相信
Not to beat about the bush, I have reason to believe

607
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:31,420
她正在被人慢慢地下药毒害
she is being slowly and cold-bloodedly poisoned.

608
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:33,830
我的第一次怀疑是在..."
I first suspected this when ... "

609
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:35,800
这里就中断了
And here he breaks off.

610
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,780
那时他被杀了
He was murdered.

611
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,280
难以置信
Unbelievable.

612
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,880
我每天和她生活在一起 
Only living with her, "in and out of each other's pockets",

613
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:45,050
看不出有什么变化
one doesn't see the little changes.

614
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:47,945
你觉得克里斯提安・古尔布兰德森
And you think that Christian Gulbrandsen 

615
00:35:47,946 --> 00:35:49,609
知道是谁下的毒吗
knew the identity of the poisoner?

616
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:53,460
他应该有一点想法 要是我多问问他就好了
He had an idea. If only I had pressed him.

617
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:56,820
我想告诉你 马普尔小姐
I wanted you to know, Miss Marple,

618
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:59,420
你是我妻子的老朋友了
as an old friend of my wife's.

619
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,600
谢谢 谢谢大家
Thank you. To all of you.

620
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:05,356
你也认为她完全没有
You agree, it's imperative 

621
00:36:05,357 --> 00:36:07,709
察觉到危机吧
she discovers no hint of this threat?

622
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,868
如果一个女人处于危险的处境 
If the woman's in danger, 

623
00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:11,250
她需要了解自己的危机
she needs to be aware of the risk.

624
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:14,360
但谁会想要伤害卡莉・路易斯呢
But who would wish harm on Carrie Louise?

625
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:17,510
她可是一位受众人尊敬的女人
A woman so universally admired.

626
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,460
会有什么陷害她的动机呢
What possible motive?

627
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:22,490
当时客厅的大多数房门都锁着
Well, most of the house were locked in the drawing room,

628
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:26,910
塞罗科尔德先生正被艾德加・罗森用枪指着
Mr. Serrocold here with a gun pointed by the harmless Edgar Lawson

629
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:32,390
那看起来嫌疑人范围便缩小了
Yes, that would seem to narrow the field.

630
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,200
请让我... 谢谢
If I could just ...thanks.

631
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:40,010
就像我说的 我直接来到这里
Like I told you, I came straight here.

632
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,269
这些要命的英国电线
The er... crazy british wiring,

633
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,680
保险丝盒被烧了 已经是那晚上的第二次了
the fuse box was burned, the second time that night.

634
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:48,140
- 第二次吗 - 是啊 有人这么告诉我的
- Second, sir? - Yeah. That's what I've told.

635
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,129
大约七点的时候停了一次电
The lights went off about seven o'clock.

636
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:52,140
你能解释一下为何你的刀
Can you explain what your knife 

637
00:36:52,141 --> 00:36:54,140
会在死者的背上吗 先生
was doing in that fellow's back, sir?

638
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,879
那刀放在我们的卧室
I... well, it was in our bedroom,

639
00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:00,720
床边桌子的第二个抽屉 任何人都可以拿到
second drawer, bedside table. Anybody could have taken it.

640
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:04,560
任何人
Anybody.

641
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:05,869
你相信他的话吗
Do you believe him?

642
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,039
我一向对美国人都没有太多同情
I never had much sympathy toward americans.

643
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:09,729
至少这个人在战争的时候尽本职了
At least this one did his bit in the war.

644
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:12,679
- 屋里的工作人员呢 - 晚上放假
- What about house staff? - Night off.

645
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:14,889
前夫呢 约翰尼・雷斯塔瑞克
The ex-husband? Johnny Restarick?

646
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,159
我认为是他做的 一定是他做的
I think it was him, sir. It has to be.

647
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:20,969
他是唯一一个没有合理解释的人 不是吗先生
He's the only other person who's unaccounted for. Right, sir?

648
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,579
我想我们还能找到更多线索
I think we can do better than that.

649
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:25,730
不要只看表面 莱克警官
Never underestimate the power of the obvious, sergeant Lake.

650
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:27,989
- 先生 - 这些笼中之鸟
- Sir? - Flotted jailbirds,

651
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,730
内心迂腐 燃烧着内心的愤怒
rotten to the core, simmering in their own juices.

652
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,467
江山易改本性难移 莱克警官 
The leopard don't change it's spots, sergeant Lake, 

653
00:37:34,468 --> 00:37:36,080
在西部巴克斯也一样
not in West Bucks.

654
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,140
说得好 先生
Certainly well drawed, Sir.

655
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,809
看起来 他们每天早上都这样训练
Apparently, they do training like this, every morning.

656
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:42,370
为了什么训练呢
Training for what?

657
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,412
他在那里做什么 
What's he doing here? 

658
00:37:45,413 --> 00:37:47,540
刘易斯・塞罗科尔德的命令
Lewis Serrocold's orders.

659
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:52,110
他对比赛又不感兴趣 来吧
Not keen on the competition, hey? Come on.

660
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:55,780
雷斯塔瑞克先生 能否说句话
Sr. Restarick. A word, if you please.

661
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:03,420
如果你问我 刘易斯只是想仔细看看
If you ask me, Lewis wants a closer look.

662
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:07,299
这些大城市的官员就和神圣的牧师一样
I mean, these city suits, are just glorified clerks,

663
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:10,340
从西方赶来 周五的夜晚
coming from the west,Friday night, you know.

664
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,099
一副道貌岸然的样子 拜托
Butter wouldn't melt in his mouth. Oh, please,

665
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:13,860
以为我看不出来吗
I've seen it dribbling down his chin.

666
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:18,250
- 你为什么要来斯托尼盖特 - 因为爱情
- What brought to Stonygates? - Love gave me wings.

667
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,194
我可要保持身材 
Got to get fit, you see. 

668
00:38:22,195 --> 00:38:23,700
为了塞罗科尔德夫人吗
For Mrs. Serrocold?

669
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:28,580
每个人都应该得到第二次机会 不是吗
Look, everybody is entitled to a second chance, aren't they?

670
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:30,719
- 除了杀人犯 - 老天
- Except for muderers. - Oh, please.

671
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:34,260
所以你从火车站走过来 穿过公园
So, you came walking from the station, proceeded through the park,

672
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,969
去到了房子的后院 是这样吗 先生
til the back of the main house. Is this correct, sir?

673
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:40,310
我最有嫌疑是吗 独自一人 没有证人
Perfect suspect, aren't I? Quite alone, no witnesses.

674
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,922
请问先生在你走到房子的路上 
Seen anything, sir, 

675
00:38:42,923 --> 00:38:44,089
有看到什么吗
on your way round to the house?

676
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:47,980
我以一种非常疯狂且独特的方式出场了
Now, I did one of my mad, criative turns.

677
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:49,779
我并不指望你能理解
Here, I wouldn't expect you to understand that.

678
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:52,290
- 你怎么可能会理解呢 - 可以试着理解
- How could you? - I might.

679
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:55,000
那晚雾很大
Well, it was the fog that got me going,

680
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:57,540
黑暗之中 我站在花园里
standing there, in the darkness of the garden.

681
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,940
听到了脚步声 然后是枪声
Footsteps. And then the gun.

682
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:02,909
我当时便想
And I thought to myself: now that's

683
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,840
这样的效果完全可以用在莱姆豪斯之夜
exactly the effect that I want for my Limehouse Nights.

684
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:10,010
- 我的芭蕾舞剧 - 脚步声吗
- My ballet? - Footsteps?

685
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,170
- 哪边来的 - 分辨不出来 老伙计
- Where from? - Impossible to say, old man.

686
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:18,839
所以你是穿过花园走到了落地窗前
So, you crossed the garden to the french windows.

687
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:22,530
是啊 好奇要去看看
Yeah. Yes. Well, fancied to a closer look.

688
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:24,860
有什么问题吗
Anything wrong with that?

689
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,210
我怪我自己
I blame myself.

690
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:45,000
克里斯提安死了 
Christian dead, 

691
00:39:45,001 --> 00:39:46,969
现在又是吉娜她那年轻的美国小伙
and now Gina's young american.

692
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:49,249
你觉得瓦利可能是杀人犯吗
You think Wally might have committed the murder?

693
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,740
我也不知道
I don't know what to think.

694
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:52,410
但有时候我很疑惑
But sometimes I wonder.

695
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,899
她如此匆忙地结婚
The way she rushed into the marriage,

696
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:57,410
是不是为了得到母亲的注意
was it for want of a mother's affection?

697
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,589
我真不应该花这么多时间在工作上
If I'd been less consumed with my own work.

698
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,049
而是花更多的时间和精力在她身上
If I'd given more time, or more energy.

699
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:07,230
小孩都需要被关怀 被爱护 不是吗
A child needs to feel cherished in the nursery, doesn't she?

700
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:09,830
不然她便一直不知道自己存在的意义
Or she'll never come to know her own value.

701
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:13,370
更何况 还是领养的小孩
Above all, an adopted child.

702
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,890
什么声音
What was that?

703
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:23,830
不 看
Oh, no, look!

704
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:28,850
停下来 警察
Stop! Police!

705
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:30,140
停下来
Stop!

706
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,370
警察
Police!

707
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:07,610
瓦利 
Wally!

708
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:13,320
瓦利
Oh! Oh, Wally!

709
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:15,020
他还有呼吸吗
Is he breathing?

710
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:17,820
我们到了吗
Are we there?

711
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:22,419
这真是荒谬 你们应该立刻叫我过来
This is monstrous! I should have been summoned at once!

712
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:24,189
我是受托人 我有权利
I am a Trustee. I have rights.

713
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,099
如果有人想要杀我的姐姐...
And if someone is trying to kill my sister ...

714
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:29,199
恐怕这不是"如果" 我刚收到了确认的电报
No "if" about that, I'm affraid. I just received a telegram confirming

715
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:31,799
塞罗科尔德夫人的药中含有砒霜
the presence of arsenic in Mrs. Serrocold's bottle of tonic.

716
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:33,387
那我们应该立刻告诉她 
Then we must tell her at once! 

717
00:41:33,388 --> 00:41:34,480
我的老天 鲁思
For pete's sake, Ruth!

718
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,149
先等到明天我们做好准备 以防万一好吗
Keep your powder dry until the morning, will ya?

719
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,679
真是奇怪
Oh, how perfectly quaint!

720
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:40,780
难怪你们国家会输掉整个王国
No wonder you people have lost the Empire.

721
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:42,568
杀人犯仍在逍遥法外 
There's a killer on the loose! 

722
00:41:42,569 --> 00:41:44,050
你以为我不知道吗
You think I don't know that?

723
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,259
每次她拿起勺子送到嘴边
You think I don't hold my breath

724
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:47,240
我都心惊胆战的
every time she lifts a spoon to her lips?

725
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:50,429
我也在尽最大的努力保护我的妻子
I'm trying to protect my wife as lovingly as I can.

726
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:53,290
你为她太小题大做了 一直都是这样
You're making too much fuss of her. You always have.

727
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,269
哈德先生情况怎么样了
How is Mr. Hudd fairing?

728
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:03,060
我们随时都可以把他带走 女士
Oh, we'll have him off your in no time, ma'am

729
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:05,960
只要等他可以移动就好
just as soon as he's fit to move.

730
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:33,340
我怎么知道他在想什么
How would I know what he's been up to?

731
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,239
他要做什么 我怎么知道
How would I know the first thing about him?

732
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:36,890
我只是他的妻子
I'm only his wife, after all!

733
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,110
对不起 房间很乱
Sorry. Such mess.

734
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:41,870
在抽屉某处找到的
Found this in a drawer, somewhere.

735
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:45,180
虽然我没有仔细想 但看起来像是预谋好的
It's the er... air of contriver, as I don't care for.

736
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,680
什么
What?

737
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:50,820
我只是在想 这一切都那么巧合
Well, I was just thinking how convenient it all was,

738
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:55,510
我们安全地被困在了客厅
there we were in the drawing room, safely under locking key,

739
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:57,720
而碰巧这时候...
preciselly the moment when ...

740
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,113
我明白你的意思 
I get it your point. 

741
00:42:59,114 --> 00:43:01,740
但如果没有别的地方可以出去...
But if there was no other way out ...

742
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:04,910
瓦利 不
Wally! No!

743
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:08,510
吉娜 吉娜
Gina? Gina!

744
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:12,719
你们不能带走他 不能带走他
Don't you dare, gents! Don't you dare!

745
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:13,960
放开他
Get away from them!

746
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,479
放开 我不会让你们带走他的
Get away! I won't let you ...

747
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:17,619
你们不能带走他
You can't take him away.

748
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:19,830
我有很重要的事要告诉探长
I've got something very important to tell the Inspector!

749
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:25,340
这真是新鲜事 
What fresh air is this, hey?

750
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:28,150
给
Here, take. 

751
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:30,669
- 别闹 别闹 吉娜 - 放开
- Please, please, Gina! - Let go!

752
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:35,509
- 放开他 - 别闹了 吉娜
- Come! Leave him! - Gina, please!

753
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,339
冷静点 你这是在帮倒忙
Calm down, please. This isn't helping at all.

754
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:39,540
- 他什么都没做 - 先进来
- He hasn't done anything! - Come inside.

755
00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:43,930
好了 年轻的小姐 你想要给我们看什么
Now, young lady, what was it you wanted to show us?

756
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:45,740
我们任何一个人都能离开这房间
Anyone of us could have left this room 

757
00:43:45,741 --> 00:43:47,030
去杀那可怜的克里斯提安
to murder poor Christian.

758
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:50,920
那儿 看到了吗
There, you see?

759
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:58,510
进吧 莱克警官 进来吧
Come on, sargeant Lake. Come on.

760
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:00,390
去吧
Go on.

761
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:04,460
这边来 探长先生
This way, Inspector.

762
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:12,140
来
Come.

763
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:14,020
她去哪儿了
Where does she go?

764
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,370
先生 有火柴
Sir, look. Matches.

765
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:30,950
- 最近的吗 - 应该是的
- Recents? - I should say.

766
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:33,630
很奇怪的味道
Interesting smell.

767
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:35,680
- 柴油吗 - 有可能
- Diesel? - Possibly.

768
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:37,298
看到了吗 探长先生 
So, you see, Inspector, 

769
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:38,770
我们任何一个人都有嫌疑
any of us could have done it.

770
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:41,959
这真是荒谬 罗森先生一开始表演
That's absurd. Once Mr. Lawson started firing,

771
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:43,299
我们全都在原地不动
we were all frozen to the spot.

772
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:44,780
没有人动过吗
Nobody moved?

773
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:48,580
哈德先生离开的期间 所有人都在场吗
Everyone present and correct throughout Mr. Hudd's absence?

774
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:54,040
- 我要你们成为我的见证人 - 是的
- And I want all of you to be my witnesses. - Absolutely.

775
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:56,660
但那时候停电了
But the lights were out.

776
00:44:58,190 --> 00:44:59,820
那我也看见了
I know what I saw.

777
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:01,270
斯蒂文吗
Stephen?

778
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:04,009
他在弹琴 我叫他停下来
He was lurking at the piano. I told him not.

779
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:05,740
斯蒂文 你这是在帮倒忙
Stephen, that really isn't helping.

780
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,280
不是 斯蒂文跑去帮忙了
No, no. Stephen went for help.

781
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:10,079
这些日子 帮你写信
All these weeks writing your letters.

782
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:12,000
他出去时把门锁了
He's gone and locked the bloody door!

783
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:14,980
那...他在那儿之后去哪儿了
And er ... where did he go after that?

784
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:16,800
我也不清楚
I couldn't honestly say.

785
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:19,260
那年轻的哈德夫人呢
And young Mrs. Hudd?

786
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:20,590
吉娜吗
Gina?

787
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:24,160
她和我一起 就在其他人身后
She was with me, just behind the others.

788
00:45:28,070 --> 00:45:30,110
你确定吗
You quite certain of that fact?

789
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:34,140
你这一问...
Well, now that you press me ...

790
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:37,390
她从窗户那边走过来
.. She came away from the window ...

791
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:39,180
请把瓦利叫过来
Will somebody, please, get Wally?

792
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:41,429
穿着那可笑的衣服
.. in that preposterous outfit,

793
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,720
可那之后...
but then ...

794
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:47,419
你是在怀疑我妹妹...
You don't think my sister could ...

795
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:50,720
我们目前还没有任何结论
Now, we are not jumping to any conclusions.

796
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:54,359
她这人一直都非常轻浮 反复无常 
Well, she's always been flighty. Unpredictable, volatile.

797
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:57,960
自从她来了这里以后 便一直粘着妈妈
And she's sticking to mamma like fly-paper since the moment she got here.

798
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:01,370
米尔德里德吗
What, Mildred?

799
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,600
她撞倒了那张小桌子
Well, she knocked in that little table.

800
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:08,770
那之后 我就不知道她去哪儿了
After that, I don't know where's she gone to.

801
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:12,140
那请问 探长先生
So, now, Inspector

802
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:16,280
你不会再逮捕瓦利了吧
you're not really going to arrest my Wally, are you?

803
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,250
你在这儿做什么
What are you doing out here?

804
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:49,110
闻到了吗
Smell that?

805
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:54,260
大红木
Giant red-wood.

806
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:00,570
美国的味道
Smells of America.

807
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:07,430
这宝贝是我在这儿唯一能信任的东西了
This baby is about the last thing in this damn place I can count in.

808
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,040
别这么伤感
Don't be so melodramatic

809
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:16,540
还有 这"宝贝"是巨杉 不是红木
anyway, this "baby" is a Wellingtonia, not redwood.

810
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:23,340
- 没有区别 - 瓦利
- Makes no difference. - Wally.

811
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:30,150
瓦利 你骑着自行车要去哪里
Wally, where were you going in that bicycle?

812
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:35,400
留下我怎么办
What about me?

813
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:35,610
- 亲爱的 你在做什么 - 干活
- Darling, what're you doing? - Keeping busy.

814
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:41,339
他又蛮不讲理了吗
Oh, has he been a brut again?

815
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:43,500
- 他没有蛮不讲理 - 当然啦
- He's not a brut. - Of course not.

816
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:45,289
但他那样一个人 在你这样的姑娘面前
But a chap like that, And a gal like you,

817
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,189
他怎么会知道你想要什么
he doesn't know what makes you tick.

818
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,529
- 他怎么知道 - 我想要什么
- How could he? - What makes me tick?

819
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:52,020
镇里的公寓
A flat in town.

820
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:54,579
装满漂亮衣服的衣柜
A wardrobe heaving with pretty clothes.

821
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:57,519
和一个爱干净的大眼情人
And a cow-eyed lover who doesn't leave crums in the bed.

822
00:48:57,530 --> 00:48:58,930
没错吧
Am I right?

823
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,270
你一点都不了解我 
You don't know the first thing about me. 

824
00:49:02,271 --> 00:49:03,680
我了解得足够多了
I know all I need.

825
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:06,859
总有一天 我会和克罗伊斯君王一样富有
One day, I'm gonna be as rich as Croesus.

826
00:49:06,870 --> 00:49:08,310
只要我的话剧上演
As soon as I receive my play off.

827
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:13,630
而你 亲爱的 将会成为克罗伊斯皇后
And you, my dear, you shall be as rich as Mrs. Croesus.

828
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:17,610
嫁给我
Marry me.

829
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:19,460
傻瓜
Idiot!

830
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,900
你不是喜欢男人围着你转吗
You like to having men mooning after you, don't you?

831
00:49:22,770 --> 00:49:24,709
是的 很残忍吧
Yes. Is it very cruel?

832
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,670
太残忍了
Yes. Terribly.

833
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:28,410
但是
Still...

834
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:32,370
用不了几年 我就没那魔力了
..in a few years the magic will soon wear off

835
00:49:34,370 --> 00:49:36,790
没人会再关注我了
and no-one will look at me ever again.

836
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,740
所有人 甚至你
And everyone, even you ...

837
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:45,770
都会看到我有多堕落
.. will see how truly rotten how really am.

838
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:53,560
斯蒂文
Stephen!

839
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:57,440
你好 蜜儿
Hello, Mil.

840
00:49:58,540 --> 00:49:59,980
你们怎么能
How could you?

841
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,739
不过我倒不惊讶
I don't know why I'm surprised.

842
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:05,479
什么事都跟吉娜有关 跟谁都有一腿
Anything goes with Gina. Or anyone.

843
00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:06,860
请别说出去
Please, don't say anything.

844
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:09,009
你不会说的吧 蜜儿
You won't say anything, will you, Mil?

845
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:11,879
- 你们选的时间恶心到我了 - 时间
- It's the timing that sickens me. - Timing?

846
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:14,190
- 妈妈被人下毒了 - 什么
- Mother being poisoned. - What?

847
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:16,620
没听说吗
Ha, didn't you hear?

848
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:19,649
- 很明显是砒霜 - 别说了 蜜儿
- With arsenic, aparently. - Give it a rest, Mil.

849
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:24,350
震惊了吧
Mm... mark the air of tragic surprise.

850
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:27,210
别装无辜 小妞
Don't come with innocent with me, young lady.

851
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:33,170
我说过 血统
As I said, blood, well... out.

852
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:44,250
毒死塞罗科尔德太太 谁受益最大呢
Who had most to gain from the poisoning of Mrs. Serrocold?

853
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:46,460
如果我妻子死了
In the event of my wife's death,

854
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:49,789
房产是平分给两个女儿的
the estate is to be divided equally between our daughters,

855
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,120
吉娜和米尔德里德
Gina and Mildred.

856
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:54,549
还有一万美元给她的闺蜜
And, in addition $10.000 to her companion..

857
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:55,879
贝耶维小姐
Miss Bellever?

858
00:50:55,890 --> 00:50:59,150
还有一万美元给小斯蒂文
And a further $10 000 for young Stephen.

859
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,609
每个人都有动机
No end of motive.

860
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:02,840
我可以问下你有什么好处吗 先生
And you, sir, if you don't mind my asking?

861
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:05,109
刘易斯他自己就有钱得很
Oh, Lewis is rolling in money of his own.

862
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,689
没有的事
Not quite, if I may put it.

863
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:09,010
遗嘱好像是最近才写的
The paperwork looks rather new.

864
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:13,120
是的 六周前我的妻子重立的
Yes. My wife had to rewritten it six weeks ago.

865
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:15,670
- 因为那场火灾吗 - 是的
- On account of the fire? - That's right.

866
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:16,789
做了什么修改
Anything altered?

867
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:21,340
加了给斯蒂文的那笔钱
only the extra funds for Stephen.

868
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:23,570
看不出什么来
I wouldn't read anything into that.

869
00:51:24,090 --> 00:51:25,869
上一场音乐会搞砸了之后
I think my wife was rather concerned

870
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:28,489
我妻子就相当担心他
when its latest musical went south.

871
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:31,569
他知道吗 他知道自己会分到遗产吗
And did he know this? Did he know about the extra cash?

872
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:35,800
- 我想我妻子没告诉他 - 奇怪
- I believe my wife did tell him. - Mistifier.

873
00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:39,330
你走神了 马普尔小姐
She is miles away. Miss Marple?

874
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:42,760
不好意思
I'm so sorry.

875
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:47,649
我刚刚在想艾德加・罗森的事 真的太奇怪了
I was thinking about Edgar Lawson and how very odd it was.

876
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:48,439
继续说
Go on.

877
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:51,140
我想知道他为什么针对你
I do wonder, why do turn on you,

878
00:51:51,350 --> 00:51:54,940
针对一个对他比别人都好的人
the one person that has done more for him than anyone else?

879
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:58,780
为什么是那天晚上 正好是凶案发生的时候
And why that night, at the very moment of the murder?

880
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:02,780
你这么说起来 是很奇怪
Odd..., as you say.

881
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:05,220
不止这样吧
Well, it's more than that, isn't it?

882
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:10,489
他好像被人植入了一个想法
It's almost as if somebody put the idea into his idea.

883
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:15,180
有人利用了罗森容易激动的特点
Purposely knowing young Lawson would go off the deep end?

884
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:17,449
多么完美的掩饰方法啊
What a perfect cover that would be,

885
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:20,779
所有人都把注意力放在了罗森身上 
everybody focused on young Lawson, specially if that somebody

886
00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:23,780
特别是那人还体贴地给了罗森一把枪
had thoughtfully supplied a revolver from the gun room.

887
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:28,319
- 我不仅犯了错... - 罗森先生
- What I did wasn't just wrong, was just ... - Mr. Lawson.

888
00:52:28,330 --> 00:52:29,449
不 让我说完
No, let me finish.

889
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:32,270
我背信弃义 不可原谅
It was unconscious, unforgivable.

890
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:33,289
他对我那么好
After all he did for me, was--

891
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:36,140
罗森先生 你是想铲土豆出气吗
Mr. Lawson, are you chipping those potatoes, or what?

892
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:39,290
我说了 都是我的错
As I said, the fault was on my head alone.

893
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:41,319
逮捕我吧 我不在乎 
Arrest me if you like, I don't care. 

894
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:42,699
冷静一下 先生
All in good time, sir.

895
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:44,230
没人和我说什么 
Nobody said anything to me

896
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:46,930
不管是塞罗科尔德先生还是其他人
regarding Mr. Serrocold, or anybody else.

897
00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:50,300
我就是太生气了
I just get angry and muddled.

898
00:52:50,350 --> 00:52:53,819
丘吉尔先生会抑郁 我也会生气
Mr. Churchill has his black dog and I ...and I have my red mist.

899
00:52:53,830 --> 00:52:54,959
没人跟你说过吗 
Nobody said a word? 

900
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,380
比如斯蒂文・雷斯塔瑞克先生也没有吗
Mr. Stephen Restarick, for instance?

901
00:52:57,470 --> 00:52:58,690
没有
No!

902
00:52:58,990 --> 00:53:01,760
其他人也没有吗 你真的确定吗
Nobody else? You're quite sure?

903
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:07,280
- 移情是很微妙的 - 移情
- Transference is a very slippery fish. - Transference?

904
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:09,299
简单地说
Simply put, the redirection

905
00:53:09,310 --> 00:53:12,649
患者会把对亲人的认知
of the patient's experiences to some significant other  ,

906
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:15,580
转移到和他最亲近的人身上
in this case, the pater or father,

907
00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:19,969
在这个案子里 就是他父亲
onto the Tabula Rasa of those closest to him.

908
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:21,089
你的意思是
All you are saying is that

909
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:24,998
艾德加・罗森把刘易斯・塞罗科尔德
Edgar Lawson came to believe that Lewis Serrocold 

910
00:53:24,999 --> 00:53:26,460
当成了他父亲
was his Pop?

911
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:28,720
没错 就是这意思
In a word. Yes, exactly. Mm.

912
00:53:29,310 --> 00:53:33,250
可能在艾德加的想象中
Indeed, it could be that in Edgar's imagination, the pater

913
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:36,748
对父亲的憎恨 
familias was more an object of rage, 

914
00:53:36,749 --> 00:53:39,240
远甚于崇拜
rather than worship.

915
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:43,259
其实 他常提到的那个
In fact, this "spy" of whom he constantly talks,

916
00:53:43,270 --> 00:53:46,170
暗中监视诋毁他的人
always watching and whispering:

917
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:50,210
就是他失缺的父亲的化身
could simply be a representation of the absent father.

918
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:51,539
那就是说 他是个疯子
So, "round the twist", was he?

919
00:53:51,550 --> 00:53:55,980
不 探长 千万别用那个词
No. Please, Inspector, never, never use that term.

920
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:59,980
而且 直到最近几周
Besides, up until the last few weeks,

921
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:02,809
艾德加进展良好
one was making great strides with Edgar.

922
00:54:32,890 --> 00:54:36,809
快点 快点 欧尼斯特病得很厉害 快点
Quick, quick! Mr. Ernest is very ill. Quick!

923
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:38,739
去楼上医务室
Upstairs into the infirmary.

924
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:41,549
别让身体创伤变成精神创伤
We mustn't transform physical trauma into mental trauma,

925
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:42,339
尽力救他
whatever we do.

926
00:54:42,350 --> 00:54:44,180
楼上 把他抬楼上去
Upstairs! Take him upstairs!

927
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:45,880
夫人
Madam.

928
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,410
这是
I say...?!

929
00:55:04,990 --> 00:55:06,310
什么鬼东西
What the devil?

930
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:09,409
- 生蚝 - 生蚝
- Oysters? - Oysters.

931
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:10,309
臭了
Rotten.

932
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:13,480
- 一定是 - 难怪成那样了
- Must be. - No wonder he was off-colour.

933
00:55:13,530 --> 00:55:14,620
长官
Sir!

934
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:20,060
你就是这样对待他们的吗
So... this is how you feed them water, is it?

935
00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:22,099
- 他们 - 犯人们
- Them? - The convicts.

936
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,400
他叫欧尼斯特
His name is Ernest,

937
00:55:24,310 --> 00:55:27,170
先声明 我对这些东西一点都不了解
and for the record, I have no idea of how those supplies have got in there.

938
00:55:28,310 --> 00:55:30,610
我觉得是用这个
I think I could far them a guess.

939
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:32,940
看到了吧
Oh, would you look at that?

940
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:35,109
庄园里的钥匙
The keys of the kingdom.

941
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:37,930
欧尼斯特有了它就能来去自如了
Perhaps your Mr. Ernest could come and go as he pleased.

942
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,129
他肯定是去厨房拿了不少吃的
He must be helping himself fom the kitchen.

943
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:44,909
夫人的药也在厨房 他下了砒霜后
Or as he took a byte to eat after he slipped some arsenic into

944
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:46,600
就顺手拿了点吃的
Madam's tonic, which also can be found in the kitchen .

945
00:55:46,670 --> 00:55:49,239
我想他来自惠特斯特布尔
He hails from Whitstable, I believe.

946
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:50,729
生蚝之乡
Home of oysters.

947
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:51,439
没错
Quite right.

948
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:54,849
但是在那个地方长大的人
One imagines a fellow bought up around this particular kind of food

949
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:57,450
应该一眼就看出来是不是...
would know immediately if they were...

950
00:55:57,730 --> 00:55:59,239
- 坏了 - 没错
- Off? - Quite.

951
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:01,600
你是说生蚝被下毒了吗
You think the oysters were poisoned?

952
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,239
肯定是
Of course.

953
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:05,960
- 先生 - 是鲁思为卡莉・路易斯订的
- Sir? - Ruth ordered them for Carrie Louise.

954
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:08,830
我妻子仅有的嗜好之一
One of my wive's very few indulgences.

955
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:11,880
他们接下来还会怎么做呢
Oh, whatever will they think of next?

956
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:17,760
或许是时候和卡莉・路易斯开诚布公了
Might this be the time to break the news to Carrie Louise?

957
00:56:18,310 --> 00:56:22,520
我自己家里有人想害我
Someone in my own home is seeking to poison me,

958
00:56:23,070 --> 00:56:25,014
而我亲爱的克里斯提安
and my own dear Christian murdered 

959
00:56:25,015 --> 00:56:28,040
在说出这个人的名字之前被杀了
before he could name my enemy?

960
00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:32,080
抱歉 亲爱的 瞒着你是我的主意
I'm sorry, my love, it was my decision to keep all this from you.

961
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:34,350
我就知道不太对劲 是吧 简
I knew something was up, didn't I, Jane?

962
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:39,109
- 所以你来这是... - 我委托的
- So you came here ... - On my orders.

963
00:56:39,110 --> 00:56:41,399
我知道你不会同意 所以就没问你
I knew you wouldn't have agreed, so I didn't ask you.

964
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,329
亲爱的妹妹 你还真有先见之明
My dear sister, how very prescient!

965
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:45,760
我们只想帮点忙
We're only trying to help here!

966
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:49,589
原谅我 真希望我能早点来
Forgive me. I only wish I had come sooner.

967
00:56:49,590 --> 00:56:50,780
确实
Indeed.

968
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:53,279
亲爱的欧尼斯特怎么样了
And how is dear Ernest?

969
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,649
神志不清 但总算是还活着
Unconscious, but alive, thank goodness.

970
00:56:55,650 --> 00:56:57,809
毒药对他影响很大
The poison must work his way through it.

971
00:56:57,810 --> 00:57:00,119
那倒是教他以后别再偷东西了
That will teach him to keep his thieving hands to himself.

972
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:03,050
- 前提是他活得足够长 - 得了吧 姐姐
- Provided he lives long enough. - Oh, come off it, sis!

973
00:57:03,130 --> 00:57:04,659
如果你真想改变这些人
If you really wish to reform these people,

974
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:07,749
有更简单 更经济的办法
there are simpler and more economical ways to do it.

975
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:09,762
这就是你拯救破碎世界的方法 
And that's your remedy for a broken world? 

976
00:57:09,763 --> 00:57:10,769
给他们吃砒霜吗
Let them eat arsenic?

977
00:57:10,770 --> 00:57:11,729
亲爱的
Darling!

978
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:15,140
有时候我觉得她想让我做的每件事都失败
Well, sometimes, I think she wants everything I do to fall apart,

979
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:16,545
那样她就可以证明
so that she can prove 

980
00:57:16,546 --> 00:57:18,700
整个世界都和她一样残酷无情
the world is as savage and heartless as she is!

981
00:57:19,790 --> 00:57:21,129
希望没打扰到各位
Not interrupting, I presume?

982
00:57:21,130 --> 00:57:22,969
完全没有 我正准备走
Not at all, I was just leaving.

983
00:57:22,970 --> 00:57:24,799
鲁思 你才刚到不久
Ruth, you've only just got in here.

984
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,389
夫人 我记得你为今晚的晚餐
Madam, I gather you've ordered in

985
00:57:26,390 --> 00:57:29,420
订了几盒生蚝
several boxes of oysters for tonight's supper.

986
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:33,089
是的 你没看到这儿被弄得多脏吗
Yes! Have you seen the filth they serve in this place?

987
00:57:33,090 --> 00:57:34,959
灰色 灰色 全是灰色
Beige! Beige! Everything's beige!

988
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,040
任何人都不能离开这
I would ask that nobody leave this compound.

989
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:38,560
别开玩笑了
Don't be absurd.

990
00:57:39,230 --> 00:57:40,819
介意把我的包
Would you mind seeing that my bags

991
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:43,229
拿到楼下我的车里吗 谢谢了
are brought down to my car, please? Thank you.

992
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:44,750
我是个...
I'm a er ...

993
00:57:55,290 --> 00:57:58,700
鲁思和卡莉・路易斯只有在远隔重洋的时候
Ruth and Carrie Louise have always been the best of sisters ...

994
00:57:59,130 --> 00:58:02,030
才是最好的姐妹
providing they maintain an ocean between them.

995
00:58:02,490 --> 00:58:04,240
那约翰尼・雷斯塔瑞克呢
And Johnny Restarick?

996
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,660
他是最好的前夫吗
Is he the best of ex-husbands?

997
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,850
众说纷纭 有这个词吧
"The jury is out". Is that the phrase?

998
00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:12,500
走吧
Shall we?

999
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:17,289
不过 要从这个戏剧性的地方
Still, it's not easy to conduct a poisoning campaign

1000
00:58:17,290 --> 00:58:21,320
找出谁下的毒可不是件容易的事
from the bordellos of London theatrical district

1001
00:58:21,890 --> 00:58:24,459
说的不错 探长先生
An excellent point, Inspector, very well made.

1002
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:25,549
谢谢
Oh, thank you.

1003
00:58:25,550 --> 00:58:27,800
突然想到
You know, it did occur to me,

1004
00:58:27,810 --> 00:58:30,259
我们一直在猜测嫌疑犯
that we've all been so busy, wondering if the convicts

1005
00:58:30,270 --> 00:58:33,500
是怎么从正门进到房子里的
could have climbed the main gate to the house

1006
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:36,440
以至于我们忽略了其他门
that we lost sight of the other gate.

1007
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:39,020
其他门
Other...?

1008
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:41,350
这里 小屋旁
Here, by the lodge.

1009
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:46,290
约翰尼・雷斯塔瑞克说他穿过花园进到房子里
Johnny Restarick claims that he entered the house through the park.

1010
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:50,530
这些门每天傍晚五点整就锁了
I gather these are locked every evening at five o'clock sharp.

1011
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:52,780
真好奇
One wonders,

1012
00:58:52,910 --> 00:58:55,537
一个已过壮年的绅士
how did a gentleman, 

1013
00:58:55,538 --> 00:58:59,040
是怎样翻过或穿过这门的呢
past his physical prime get over it or through?

1014
00:58:59,050 --> 00:59:01,540
除非有人帮他
Well, unless someone gave him a helping hand.

1015
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:03,819
是他的儿子 斯蒂文
His son. Stephen.

1016
00:59:03,830 --> 00:59:06,010
我们知道他会从遗嘱中获利
We know he stands to gain from the will.

1017
00:59:06,289 --> 00:59:06,889
可能吧
Perhaps,

1018
00:59:06,890 --> 00:59:11,240
但我感觉这父子俩的关系不是那么亲密
although I don't sense any great intimacy between father and son.

1019
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:13,710
那会是谁
Well, who then?

1020
00:59:23,290 --> 00:59:25,740
我还记得你接的那个电话
It was the phone call that struck me.

1021
00:59:26,010 --> 00:59:28,910
不需要 我已经通知过园丁了
There's no need. I've already informed the groundsman.

1022
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:30,790
我会亲自去看一下的
I'll see to it myself.

1023
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:32,920
再见
Goodbye.

1024
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:36,270
- 是塞罗科尔德先生打来的吗 - 是的
- Is that Mr. Serrocold? - Yes, sir.

1025
00:59:36,350 --> 00:59:38,600
他会按计划在四点二十七分回家
He'll be home in the 4:27 as planned.

1026
00:59:38,730 --> 00:59:41,020
探长先生 我可以冒昧推测一下吗
If I may presume, Inspector?

1027
00:59:42,090 --> 00:59:45,760
那天你匆匆地接了一个怎样的小任务呢
What small task were you so quick to entertain, that day?

1028
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:49,410
是你开的门 对吧
You were unlocking the gates, weren't you?

1029
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:51,400
给塞罗科尔德先生开的吗
For Mr. Serrocold?

1030
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:54,400
或者说当时那些门可能没关
Or so they might have left open,

1031
00:59:54,630 --> 00:59:59,030
给晚些要来的另一位访客留着
giving another visitor access to to the house, later on that night?

1032
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,540
约翰尼・雷斯塔瑞克
Johnny Restarick.

1033
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:06,730
贝耶维小姐 他非常潇洒 对吗
Quite dashing in his way, isn't he, Miss Bellever?

1034
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:10,000
我曾经这样觉得
I used to think so.

1035
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:12,820
当然 这并不是什么大错
No great crime in that, surely

1036
01:00:13,650 --> 01:00:16,940
每两周 我都会去一次小镇
I'd go up to town, once a fortnight,

1037
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:20,480
在我休假的时候 看一场午后演出
on my day off... catch a matinée.

1038
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:24,040
我在表演结束后偶然遇到了约翰尼
I ran into Johnny after the show.

1039
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:27,310
他风度翩翩
He was in his element.

1040
01:00:28,570 --> 01:00:32,880
相比在乡下 那个下午一切都是那么迷人
It all seemed so glamorous, after long afternoons in the country.

1041
01:00:35,870 --> 01:00:40,450
我应该是被迷住了
I was seduced, I supposed.

1042
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:45,100
然后约翰尼开始说起卡莉・路易斯
Then, Johnny started up about Carrie Louise.

1043
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:46,950
他必须要和她谈谈
He had to talk to her.

1044
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:48,599
一定要告诉她
She had to be told,

1045
01:00:48,610 --> 01:00:51,760
否则我们的关系将会是"地下情"
or our affair would be "tainted by deception".

1046
01:00:52,540 --> 01:00:55,610
当然 灯亮起来的时候
Of course, the minute the lights came up,

1047
01:00:56,270 --> 01:00:57,989
我才明白我是个傻瓜
I saw what a fool I'd been.

1048
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,610
看看你 我的天使
Look at you, my Botticelli angel.

1049
01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:03,980
我只是一个工具
I was a convenience.

1050
01:01:04,690 --> 01:01:08,320
这是约翰尼回到卡莉・路易斯身边的一个诡计
A ruse for Johnny to get back in to Carrie Louise.

1051
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:11,770
他的虚荣心不会允许
His vanity wouldn't allow it, you see.

1052
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:14,020
她再和别人结婚
For her to be married again.

1053
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:16,979
他不能忍受被抛弃
He couldn't bear to be left behind.

1054
01:01:16,990 --> 01:01:18,499
是不是雷斯塔瑞克先生说服你
Did Mr. Restarick persuade you

1055
01:01:18,510 --> 01:01:21,390
在塞罗科尔德夫人的补药里下毒的
to put poison in Mrs. Serrocold's tonic?

1056
01:01:22,390 --> 01:01:25,730
我绝对不会加害塞罗科尔德夫人
I would never lay a finger on Mrs. Serrocold.

1057
01:01:27,530 --> 01:01:28,630
绝对不会
Never.

1058
01:01:36,510 --> 01:01:37,530
马可
Marks...

1059
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:42,160
预备 跑
Set... Go!

1060
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:49,429
听着 我很喜欢卡莉・路易斯
Look, I'm devoted to Carrie Louise.

1061
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:50,999
我怎么会想着用砒霜
Why would I want to "bump her off" for,

1062
01:01:51,010 --> 01:01:53,060
来谋杀她呢
and with arsenic, of all things?

1063
01:01:53,490 --> 01:01:55,309
要是我的话 我更偏爱箭毒
Personnally, I got a weakness for curare.

1064
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:57,770
一种被低估了的毒药
A much underrated poison.

1065
01:01:58,780 --> 01:02:01,260
再加把劲 警官
Give it some, Sargeant!

1066
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:03,390
这样做到底有什么用
What does all of this aid of, anyway?

1067
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:05,760
只是想把事实串起来
Just trying to get my facts in order.

1068
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:09,360
听到第一声枪响的时候你就站着这 对吗
You were standing here when the first shot was fired, correct?

1069
01:02:10,850 --> 01:02:11,879
如果你这样认为的话
If you say so.

1070
01:02:11,890 --> 01:02:13,010
我想问
The question is,

1071
01:02:13,210 --> 01:02:15,270
屋子里停电的时候
the moment the lights went out at the house,

1072
01:02:15,790 --> 01:02:17,940
一个人需要多长时间
how much time does a gentleman need?

1073
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:20,130
需要时间干什么
For what, exactly?

1074
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:23,380
进入屋子 杀了可怜的古尔布兰德森先生
To enter the house, sort up on poor Mr Gulbrandsen,

1075
01:02:23,810 --> 01:02:25,230
再逃出来
then out again,

1076
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:30,440
准备进入客厅
ready to your great entrance at the drawing room.

1077
01:02:31,770 --> 01:02:36,100
看见没 一分零七秒
See? One minute seven seconds.

1078
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:39,369
凶手比大家想象得快多了
Murderer is a lot quicker than people generally imagine.

1079
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:41,179
我的速度都不及警官的一半
I'm not half as quick as your sargeant.

1080
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:42,179
什么 比不上他的肺活量吗
What? In the sate of his lungs?

1081
01:02:42,190 --> 01:02:43,939
但这不科学 不是吗
But it's hardly scientific, is it?

1082
01:02:43,950 --> 01:02:45,629
你根本都不知道当时我站在哪
I mean, you don't even know where I was standing.

1083
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:47,330
你就只是听我说说
You only got my word for it.

1084
01:02:47,410 --> 01:02:48,379
可能你是爱她的
You might be in love with her,

1085
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:49,809
但你宁愿看她死
but you'd rather see her dead

1086
01:02:49,820 --> 01:02:51,006
也不愿让她与塞罗科尔德先生
than happily settled 

1087
01:02:51,007 --> 01:02:52,010
快乐地在一起 不是吗
with Mr Serrocold, right?

1088
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:54,890
你比达希尔・哈米特[侦探小说家]更糟糕
You're worse than Dashiell Hammett.

1089
01:02:55,710 --> 01:02:57,960
该去工厂了
Time to make tracks for the facility.

1090
01:02:57,970 --> 01:02:59,459
十五分钟后启幕
The curtain goes up in 15 minutes.

1091
01:02:59,470 --> 01:03:01,129
你不会真去吧
You're not seriously going ahead?

1092
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:02,729
很明显 这个表演必须继续下去
The show must go on, apparently.

1093
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:05,050
刘易斯 这不会成功
Oh, Lewis, this is hopeless.

1094
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:06,810
别担心 亲爱的
Oh, don't worry, my love.

1095
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:10,170
印第安人承受得起失败
The Cherokee will take it on the chin.

1096
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:14,450
- 艾德加 你觉得怎么样 - 很好看
- There, Edgar, what do you think? - Very smart, sir.

1097
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:17,449
现在 为了"辉煌之作"
Now, for the "pièce de résistance".

1098
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:20,060
吉娜在哪 我整个下午都没见她
Where is Gina? I haven't seen her all afternoon.

1099
01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:21,829
她正在房间里准备
She's getting ready in her room.

1100
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:24,140
她一直嘀咕着... 凯瑟琳
She was muttering about... Katherine?

1101
01:03:26,310 --> 01:03:28,720
大家听着 还有十五分钟
OK, everyone, 15 minutes.

1102
01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:31,380
我记着我说过你不能进这屋里来
I thought I said you're not to come into the house.

1103
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:33,039
老头 你在害怕什么
What are you so affraid of, old man?

1104
01:03:33,050 --> 01:03:34,490
这不明摆着吗
I thought it was obvious,

1105
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:37,200
你杀了可怜的克里斯提安
considering you murdered poor old Christian,

1106
01:03:37,470 --> 01:03:38,669
勾搭我的秘书
battered my secretary,

1107
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:41,430
现在你又被指控毒害我的妻子
and now you're accused of poisoning my wife.

1108
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:44,119
收回那句话 不是我干的
Take that back! I did no such thing!

1109
01:03:44,130 --> 01:03:46,460
我只在再说事实 老伙计
Simple statement of the facts, old man.

1110
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:49,490
好 来吧 来吧 有本事站起来
Right! Come on, then. Come on. On your feet!

1111
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:53,389
来 来 恭候大驾
All right, all right, whenever you're ready!

1112
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,500
-父亲 - 刘易斯
- Father! - Lewis!

1113
01:03:58,220 --> 01:04:01,010
约翰尼 这你只能怪自己
Johnny, you have only yourself to blame.

1114
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:03,059
那个小伙子扑向了我
The chap flew at me.

1115
01:04:03,070 --> 01:04:05,670
你是被椅子绊倒的 大笨鹅
You tripped over a chair, you silly goose.

1116
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:09,059
我真希望那晚 我能注意一下
I just wished I paid a bit more of attention, that evening,

1117
01:04:09,070 --> 01:04:10,540
凶杀案那夜
the night of the murder.

1118
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:14,859
人们习惯于把世界当舞台
One gets so used to see the world as a sort of stage.

1119
01:04:14,870 --> 01:04:17,780
一直处于不断地幻想之中
One lives in a state of constant illusion.

1120
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:21,280
尽管只是舞台布景 但它足够真实 对吗
It's real enough, though, isn't it, a stage set?

1121
01:04:21,330 --> 01:04:24,930
虽然只是创造的 却如此真实
Contrivance it may be, but it's so real.

1122
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:27,930
用锤子 钉子 木材还有油漆
Hammers and nails. Timber and paint.

1123
01:04:28,090 --> 01:04:29,520
发明创造
Contrivance.

1124
01:04:30,810 --> 01:04:32,050
当然
Of course.

1125
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:34,800
你去哪
Where're you going?

1126
01:04:35,350 --> 01:04:38,249
那个吃生蚝中毒的伙计 他醒了吗
Your chappie with the oysters: has he come 'round yet?

1127
01:04:38,260 --> 01:04:40,250
没 还昏迷着呢 你问这干嘛
No. Still out for the count. Why do you ask?

1128
01:04:40,330 --> 01:04:41,800
没事
Oh, it doesn't matter.

1129
01:04:42,870 --> 01:04:43,950
还有...
And uh ...

1130
01:04:45,430 --> 01:04:46,630
谢谢你
and thank you.

1131
01:04:48,340 --> 01:04:49,500
为什么谢我
What for?

1132
01:04:50,210 --> 01:04:52,319
看这些指甲 看看
Would you look at these nails? Just look at them.

1133
01:04:52,330 --> 01:04:54,699
答应我 让我在表演后帮你剪掉好吗
Will you promise you'll let let me cut them for you, after the show,

1134
01:04:54,710 --> 01:04:56,150
答应我
uh? Promise?

1135
01:04:56,700 --> 01:05:01,050
# 哨兵以为她带了个足球... #
The sentries think it's a football that she carries in...

1136
01:05:02,770 --> 01:05:04,779
# 当他们摸的时候 #
And when they feel, 

1137
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:06,990
# 问道 "阿森纳会赢吗" #
they ask "Is Arsenal going to win?"

1138
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:10,616
# 他们认为那是亚力克・詹姆斯 #
They think it's Alec James, 

1139
01:05:10,617 --> 01:05:12,900
# 而不是可怜的安娜・波莱娜 #
instead of poor Ana Bolena

1140
01:05:13,180 --> 01:05:16,930
# 她的头 缩在 双臂间 #
with her head...tucked... underneath her arm

1141
01:05:18,020 --> 01:05:23,010
# 她的头 缩在 双臂间 #
with her head...tucked... underneath her arm...

1142
01:05:23,470 --> 01:05:27,190
# 她走在血塔上 #
She walks on Bloody Tower

1143
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:32,670
# 她的头 缩在 双臂间 #
with her her head...tucked...underneath her arm ...

1144
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:35,980
嗨 斯蒂文
Hey! Stephen!

1145
01:05:36,370 --> 01:05:39,670
爸 吉娜在哪 她在哪 到她上场了
Dad! Where's Gina? Where's Gina? She's next.

1146
01:05:40,820 --> 01:05:43,840
- 表演不错 - 谢谢
- Knock them dead, hey? - Thanks.

1147
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,229
- 你在看吗 - 我不会错过的
- You're watching? - Wouldn't miss it for the world.

1148
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:51,229
# 她的头 缩在 双臂间 #
With her head...tucked... underneath her arm...

1149
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:55,910
# 在午夜 #
At midnight

1150
01:06:05,660 --> 01:06:08,290
- 到你了 去吧 - 我忘了
- Your turn. Go! - Oh! I forgot.

1151
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:12,950
我妻子在哪
Where's my squaw?

1152
01:06:13,820 --> 01:06:15,140
你准备好就来了
Ready when you are.

1153
01:06:16,470 --> 01:06:18,140
你是哪个部落的
What tribe are you, then?

1154
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:31,570
小心骑兵
Watch out for the cavalry!

1155
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:37,630
刘易斯
Lewis!

1156
01:06:39,150 --> 01:06:40,460
刘易斯
Lewis!

1157
01:06:41,150 --> 01:06:42,200
该死
Bugger!

1158
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:49,760
我从远方来向你们致敬...
I have travelled far and wide to hail you from...

1159
01:06:49,790 --> 01:06:52,010
小吉 小吉
G? G!

1160
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:58,460
我 印第安酋长
To know that I... Chief Running Bear,

1161
01:06:59,770 --> 01:07:04,300
为我所爱 必须勇往直前
must brave all for the love of my dear.

1162
01:07:04,530 --> 01:07:08,950
我的第三个也是最好的妻子 夏日雨
My third and finest squaw, Summer Rain.

1163
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:14,310
她美丽动人的双眸是那样令人愉悦
Her beauties, beauties eyes pleasantly framed.

1164
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:17,850
她来了
She comes,

1165
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:21,740
丘比特的箭穿过我的心
and I am struck of fresh by Cupid's darts.

1166
01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:34,020
她萦绕在我的梦里 我的心里 我的... 
She haunts my every wishes, my thoughts, my...

1167
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:41,370
吉娜
Gina?

1168
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:48,130
凯瑟琳
Katherine.

1169
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:07,080
我的天呐
Oh, my God.

1170
01:08:33,370 --> 01:08:35,710
告诉我这只是一个意外
Tell me it was an accident.

1171
01:08:42,430 --> 01:08:43,560
看见没
See?

1172
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:47,170
切断了 用刀片 应该是
Severed. With a blade, I should imagine.

1173
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:50,310
还有一线希望
Still, there is one silver lining.

1174
01:08:50,590 --> 01:08:51,499
是什么
What's that?

1175
01:08:51,510 --> 01:08:54,820
至少这次 警官和我也是目击者之一
At least this time, my sargeant and I are among the witnesses.

1176
01:08:56,460 --> 01:08:58,860
是 当然是 
Yes. Yes, of course.

1177
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:02,249
塞罗科尔德先生 这两位受害者
Any known contact between the two victims

1178
01:09:02,260 --> 01:09:04,630
在被谋杀之前有什么接触吗
prior to the murders, Mr. Serrocold?

1179
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:06,340
约翰尼和克里斯提安吗
Johnny and Christian?

1180
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,400
我没注意到有
None of them that I'm aware of.

1181
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:09,939
一些居民说
According to some of the inmates,

1182
01:09:09,950 --> 01:09:11,942
雷斯塔瑞克先生确实摆脱过
Sr. Restarick did headed off 

1183
01:09:11,943 --> 01:09:14,600
惠特斯特布尔・欧尼斯特所谓的跟踪
with Whitstable Ernest, so called.

1184
01:09:14,610 --> 01:09:15,690
是吗
Did he ?

1185
01:09:16,510 --> 01:09:18,070
同谋者吗
Co-conspirators?

1186
01:09:18,190 --> 01:09:21,400
所以 约翰尼有两个内应来帮他向前妻复仇
So, Johnny had two insiders helping him revenge on the ex.

1187
01:09:21,860 --> 01:09:24,220
还有那个叫贝耶维的女人
The convict and the Bellever woman.

1188
01:09:24,390 --> 01:09:26,060
这还只是我们知道的几个
And that's just the ones we know about.

1189
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:22,290
过来 边界这里需要更多地人
Come on, I want more men on these borders!

1190
01:10:24,660 --> 01:10:25,880
亲爱的
Oh, dear.

1191
01:10:26,430 --> 01:10:27,640
简 怎么了
What is it, Jane?

1192
01:10:27,730 --> 01:10:31,300
- 你没有站起来喝茶 - 没
- You're not standing for your tea. - No.

1193
01:10:32,870 --> 01:10:34,060
今天不行
Not today.

1194
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:39,080
可怜的约翰尼
Poor Johnny.

1195
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:44,240
我的错爱
My favorite mistake.

1196
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:48,530
你可以跟我说说凯瑟琳的事吗
Would you tell me about Katherine?

1197
01:10:50,170 --> 01:10:52,880
- 谁 - 凯瑟琳・埃尔斯沃思
- Who? - Katherine Ellsworth.

1198
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:54,910
女杀人犯
The murderess.

1199
01:10:55,070 --> 01:11:00,000
1927年9月4日在波特兰被绞死
Hanged, 4th of September 1927, in Portland.

1200
01:11:02,530 --> 01:11:04,729
"埃尔斯沃思夫人在三宗砒霜投毒案中
"Mrs. Ellsworth, found guilty on

1201
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:06,900
被认定为有罪
three counts of poisoning with arsenic

1202
01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:10,870
穿着一件简单的印花棉裙子走上绞刑架
wore a simple dress of printed cotton on her final journey to the gallows.

1203
01:11:11,070 --> 01:11:13,349
她只在拒绝接受祷告时开口说了几句..."
She spoke only to decline the offer of prayers..."

1204
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:14,430
你在哪找到的
Where did you find that?

1205
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:17,370
今早 在吉娜的房间里
In Gina's room, this morning.

1206
01:11:18,310 --> 01:11:21,880
凯瑟琳・埃尔斯沃思是吉娜的生母 对吧
Katherine Ellsworth was Gina's birthmother, wasn't she?

1207
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:23,280
是
Yes.

1208
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:28,830
可以从她女儿身上看到同样的冲动
And the same urges can be seen in the daughter.

1209
01:11:29,650 --> 01:11:34,189
我告诉过她 吉娜就是神秘的投毒者
I told her, Gina is our mystery poisoner

1210
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:37,104
还有 昨晚她弄的那个
and... last night's ridiculous 

1211
01:11:37,105 --> 01:11:39,719
金黄色发型真是滑稽
carry on with that blond hairdo,

1212
01:11:39,730 --> 01:11:41,991
使她和那个女凶手看起来很像 
making herself look like that murderess, 

1213
01:11:41,992 --> 01:11:42,960
让我妈妈心烦
to upset mummy

1214
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:48,240
简直就是... 一个公开的忏悔
was nothing less than... a public confession.

1215
01:11:48,290 --> 01:11:50,039
我承认现在还不清楚
I admit I'm at a loss to know

1216
01:11:50,050 --> 01:11:52,950
吉娜是怎么知道这一切的 但...
how Gina came to learn of all this, but uh ...

1217
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:56,295
可能是有人故意把这张报纸
perhaps someone put the newspaper there 

1218
01:11:56,296 --> 01:11:58,009
放在那边让她看见的
for her to discover.

1219
01:11:58,020 --> 01:11:59,530
不可能
That's impossible.

1220
01:11:59,730 --> 01:12:01,860
没人知道 就连刘易斯也不知道
No-one knew. Not even Lewis.

1221
01:12:01,870 --> 01:12:04,620
只有我自己和米尔德里德
Only myself and Mildred.

1222
01:12:08,540 --> 01:12:09,790
米尔德里德
Mildred?

1223
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:15,840
你怎么能这样 她是你姐姐
How could you? She's your sister!

1224
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:25,740
你总是说 我们应该分享
You always said...we should share.

1225
01:12:26,830 --> 01:12:28,420
但她不肯
Well, she won't.

1226
01:12:30,020 --> 01:12:32,390
她不与我分享
She won't share.

1227
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:34,720
从未有过
She never did.

1228
01:12:35,430 --> 01:12:36,940
不仅是你
Not you.

1229
01:12:39,270 --> 01:12:41,090
她夺走了所有人
Not anybody.

1230
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:52,200
我可怜的吉娜
Oh, my...my poor darling Gina.

1231
01:12:52,990 --> 01:12:54,690
你觉得她在责怪我吗
Do you think she blames me?

1232
01:12:55,430 --> 01:12:57,950
你觉得昨天晚上她故意穿成那样
D'you think last night she was trying to hurt me

1233
01:12:58,430 --> 01:13:00,569
是对我这么多年一直对她隐瞒的报复吗
for keeping it from her all these years?

1234
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:02,299
也可能为了伤害自己
Or hurt herself.

1235
01:13:02,310 --> 01:13:04,419
我一定要去找她 跟她谈
I must go to her, speak to her.

1236
01:13:04,430 --> 01:13:09,130
卡莉・路易斯 也许你应该两边都谈谈
Carrie Louise, perhaps you should speak to them both.

1237
01:13:09,670 --> 01:13:13,670
也许这样你才能平息这多年的阴影
Together, perhaps you could lay this particular ghost to rest.

1238
01:13:28,190 --> 01:13:30,340
我还是先喝完茶吧
I think I'll finish my tea first.

1239
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:34,980
我想若世界上没有那么多秘密
I think we would all sleep a lot better in our beds

1240
01:13:36,230 --> 01:13:39,450
也许我们晚上就能安然入眠
if there weren't quite so many secrets in the world.

1241
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:44,030
你了解多少了
How much do you know?

1242
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:46,010
我并不确定
If I was quite sure... 

1243
01:13:46,011 --> 01:13:47,900
我知道你已经清楚了
Oh, I think you're sure.

1244
01:13:49,530 --> 01:13:51,200
你想要我怎么做
What do you want me to do?

1245
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:59,710
做你唯一能做的 去跟探长先生说
The only thing you can do. Talk to the inspector.

1246
01:14:02,070 --> 01:14:04,350
等我喝完这杯茶
Just as soon as I finish my tea.

1247
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:17,209
是约翰尼・雷斯塔瑞克让我想到的这点
It was Johnny Restarick that gave me the idea.

1248
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:20,630
把这间屋子不看作一间会客厅
To think of this room, not just a drawing room ...

1249
01:14:20,910 --> 01:14:23,150
可以的话把窗帘向左拉一些
Oh, a little to the left, if you wouldn't mind.

1250
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:25,309
就这样
Just so. Um ...

1251
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:27,085
不是简单的一间会客厅 
Not just a drawing room, 

1252
01:14:27,086 --> 01:14:28,850
而是一个摆满道具的场景
but as a stage set.

1253
01:14:29,060 --> 01:14:29,960
就是这样
There.

1254
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:32,290
一个戏剧晚会
An evening of dramatics.

1255
01:14:33,610 --> 01:14:35,409
向平常一样的出入口
The usual entrances and exits.

1256
01:14:35,420 --> 01:14:39,159
当然 还有后场 也就是外面的平台
And backstage, of course, outside, on the terrace.

1257
01:14:39,170 --> 01:14:42,460
包括我在内的观众坐在这
The audience, myself included, sat here,

1258
01:14:42,660 --> 01:14:45,260
被一个把戏所吸引
audient by a conjuring trick.

1259
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:47,289
他们利用了"魔镜"
They do it with mirrors.

1260
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:50,600
- "魔镜" - 这不是行话吗
- Mirrors? - Oh, isn't that the common slang?

1261
01:14:50,690 --> 01:14:53,900
一些很简单的误导行为
A few, simple acts of misdirection.

1262
01:14:54,060 --> 01:14:55,769
首先是停电
First, the power cut.

1263
01:14:55,780 --> 01:14:57,969
你认为停电是有人故意为之的
You think the lights were meant to go out.

1264
01:14:57,980 --> 01:14:59,550
我相当确定
Oh, I'm quite sure of it.

1265
01:14:59,910 --> 01:15:02,699
你记得白天的那次断电吧
You recall the power cut early in the day,

1266
01:15:02,710 --> 01:15:06,410
就是他们晚饭前用灯来试验的那次
set off by the spotlights that were being tested before supper.

1267
01:15:07,190 --> 01:15:11,300
那时候保险丝就被设置好
The fuse box was then primed to blow a second time

1268
01:15:11,390 --> 01:15:15,040
以待在会客厅的线路过载时再次跳断
when the circuit of the drawing room was overloaded.

1269
01:15:17,290 --> 01:15:19,859
- 断电了 - 线路跳断了
- Oh, block. - Wires on the blink.

1270
01:15:19,870 --> 01:15:21,649
我去看看保险丝
I'll go and check the fuse box.

1271
01:15:21,660 --> 01:15:23,530
是那个美国人吗 瓦利・哈德
The north-american? Wally Hudd?

1272
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:27,600
这将我引向了第二个误导
Oh. Which brings me to the second misdirection.

1273
01:15:29,890 --> 01:15:31,360
能不能...
Oh. Would you mind?

1274
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:35,380
- 暗门 - 对
- The hidden door. - Yes.

1275
01:15:35,470 --> 01:15:40,469
我们判断这边是凶手的第二个出口
Now, here we deduce, was the killers second exit.

1276
01:15:40,580 --> 01:15:44,290
当然停电的时候 没人知道发生了什么
And, with the lights out, of course, nobody can be sure of anything,

1277
01:15:44,470 --> 01:15:48,190
使得你有了更多的嫌疑人 探长先生
leaving you, Inspector, with a far wider cast of suspects.

1278
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:52,369
如果这暗门与谋杀根本无关呢
What if the the door had nothing to do with the murder?

1279
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:56,590
如果凶手用更加简单的方法出去了呢
Hm? What if the killer made a far simpler escape?

1280
01:15:57,040 --> 01:16:00,829
永远不要低估那些显而易见的事实 探长先生
Never underestimate the power of the obvious, Inspector.

1281
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:02,460
确实 那么...
Indeed. So ...

1282
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:05,870
请坐
Would you ...

1283
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:07,100
现在
Now,

1284
01:16:08,010 --> 01:16:12,720
那两个人从落地窗走到平台上
two men step through the french windows onto the terrace.

1285
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:17,070
但我们事实上看到的是什么
But what do we see? What do we actually see?

1286
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:19,600
当然 有艾德加・罗森
Edgar Lawson, of course,

1287
01:16:20,140 --> 01:16:23,300
但塞罗科尔德先生去哪里了
but what became of Mr. Serrocold?

1288
01:16:23,650 --> 01:16:24,799
我们听见了他的声音
We heard him.

1289
01:16:24,810 --> 01:16:26,590
- 谢谢 塞罗科尔德先生 - 艾德加
- Thank you, Mr Serrocold. - Edgar!

1290
01:16:28,060 --> 01:16:30,459
- 不许动 - 够了
- Nobody move! - That's enough.

1291
01:16:30,470 --> 01:16:31,780
另一个把戏
Another trick.

1292
01:16:31,830 --> 01:16:34,419
艾德加是在模仿...
Edgar was simply mimicking the voice of ...

1293
01:16:34,430 --> 01:16:36,450
- 刘易斯・塞罗科尔德的声音 - 对
- Lewis Serrocold! - Mm-hm.

1294
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:38,660
凶手根本不需要花任何时间
The killer would have taken no time at all.

1295
01:16:38,750 --> 01:16:42,120
比你手下一分零七秒更快
No more than your sargeant's one minute and seven seconds.

1296
01:16:50,130 --> 01:16:53,509
动机呢 我从没见过那么爱自己妻子的男人
But why? I never saw a man so devoted to his wife.

1297
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:54,500
确实如此
Quite.

1298
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:59,559
但我们怎么知道是否真的有个投毒者
But how do we know there really was a poisoner?

1299
01:16:59,570 --> 01:17:01,000
看看现有的证据
Look at the evidence.

1300
01:17:01,010 --> 01:17:05,350
卡莉・路易斯的关节炎仅仅是个巧合
Carrie Louise's arthritis was a coincidence, nothing more.

1301
01:17:05,510 --> 01:17:06,819
她用的药
And her tonic,

1302
01:17:06,830 --> 01:17:10,830
在十一点时被混入了极少量的砒霜
mixed at eleventh hour with very few drops of arsenic,

1303
01:17:10,910 --> 01:17:13,039
不是为了杀死卡莉・路易斯
intended not for Carrie Louise,

1304
01:17:13,050 --> 01:17:16,060
而是想让你和你的同事去发现
but for you and your colleagues to discover.

1305
01:17:17,570 --> 01:17:20,750
另外当塞罗科尔德先生在检查尸体时
A few words were then added to the letter

1306
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:23,210
他在信中加了一些字
when Mr. Serrocold examined his body.

1307
01:17:23,490 --> 01:17:25,479
我有理由相信
I have reason to believe

1308
01:17:25,490 --> 01:17:29,340
她正慢慢地被人下药毒害
she is being slowly and cold-bloodedly poisoned.

1309
01:17:29,810 --> 01:17:32,300
我最初有此怀疑是在...
I first suspected it when...

1310
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,560
这样信的意思就变了许多
And the meaning was quite altered.

1311
01:17:37,870 --> 01:17:41,480
所以并没有人想要毒害塞罗科尔德夫人
So, there never was any plot to poison Mrs. Serrocold.

1312
01:17:41,610 --> 01:17:43,190
是的 探长先生
No, Inspector.

1313
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:46,300
我知道约翰尼也如此怀疑
And I'm sure Johnny suspected as much.

1314
01:17:46,350 --> 01:17:47,669
因为很奇怪地
Hence his rather odd desire

1315
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:51,880
他在死前一直想要剪卡莉・路易斯的指甲
to trim Carrie Louise's fingernails a few minutes before he died.

1316
01:17:52,340 --> 01:17:54,869
剪下的指甲样本能很快证明
A sample of nail-clipping would soon have proven

1317
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:57,019
她的血液中并无毒素
there was no arsenic in her bloostream.

1318
01:17:57,030 --> 01:18:00,290
- 但他如何知道... - 就在花园里
- But how could he possibly... - There, in the garden,

1319
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:01,880
在去房子的路上
on his way up to the house,

1320
01:18:01,930 --> 01:18:04,920
他看了一眼那后台
he had a glimpse of the backstage, as it were.

1321
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:09,970
尽管起了雾 但有枪声和脚印
Even through the fog. Gunshots. And footsteps.

1322
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:13,939
当他如此友好地对待欧尼斯特时
And when Johnny befriended Ernest at the facility,

1323
01:18:13,950 --> 01:18:15,649
我认为他那时就开始就一片一片地
I'm sure he began to piece together

1324
01:18:15,660 --> 01:18:18,650
拼凑起这个毒害骗局背后的情况
the hidding story behind the poisoning hoax.

1325
01:18:19,010 --> 01:18:21,689
在欧尼斯特房间里的那些东西
as for all those treats in Ernest's room

1326
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:25,540
威士忌 钥匙 生蚝
the single malt whiskey, the keys, the oysters ...

1327
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:27,710
不是偷来的
.. They weren't stolen.

1328
01:18:27,830 --> 01:18:30,480
而是刘易斯・塞罗科尔德送他的
They were gifts from Lewis Serrocold.

1329
01:18:31,150 --> 01:18:36,129
是一个利用自己高超的诈骗挪用技巧
Grateful tokens to a man whose rare talent for fraud and

1330
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:40,219
来挽回信用基金损失财产的人得到的奖赏
embezzlement had helped restore the fallen fortune of Gulbrandsen Trust

1331
01:18:40,230 --> 01:18:41,470
但为什么
But why?

1332
01:18:42,210 --> 01:18:44,299
那样一个正直的绅士
An upstanding gentleman like that.

1333
01:18:44,310 --> 01:18:46,700
"一切都为了爱"
"The things we do for love."

1334
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:49,230
是不是这样
Wasn't it like that, 

1335
01:18:49,231 --> 01:18:50,230
塞罗科尔德先生
the way you put it, Mr Serrocold?

1336
01:18:52,570 --> 01:18:53,850
不错
Quite right.

1337
01:18:55,890 --> 01:18:57,140
简
Jane.

1338
01:18:59,470 --> 01:19:01,938
克里斯提安・古尔布兰德森
Christian Gulbrandsen 

1339
01:19:01,939 --> 01:19:03,789
发现了你的经济问题
had discovered your slide into

1340
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:07,580
并打算揭发此事
financial corruption and sought to expose it.

1341
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:12,228
但因为他对卡莉・路易斯的感情
Only his affection for Carrie Louise 

1342
01:19:12,229 --> 01:19:13,480
使他停下了脚步
gave him pause.

1343
01:19:14,220 --> 01:19:16,820
他问我"她的心脏是否强壮" 
Was her heart strong, you see.

1344
01:19:17,310 --> 01:19:19,109
你肯定知道
You must have known,

1345
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:20,756
就在七周前
he was onto you, 

1346
01:19:20,757 --> 01:19:22,720
他把受托人都召集到斯托尼盖特的时候 
the last time Christian came to Stonygates.

1347
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:26,330
你就知道他是冲你来的
When the Trustees convened, seven weeks ago,

1348
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:29,640
那时你就开始构思你的计划了 对吗
that's when you conceived your plan, wasn't it?

1349
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:31,710
先是那场火
First, the fire,

1350
01:19:31,950 --> 01:19:33,889
不是电路故障起火
started not by faulty wiring,

1351
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:34,886
而是你的同谋 
but by your accomplice, 

1352
01:19:34,887 --> 01:19:36,860
惠特斯特布尔・欧尼斯特纵的火
Whitstable Ernest.

1353
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:40,450
他藏在暗门
Concealed behind the hidden door.

1354
01:19:42,330 --> 01:19:45,560
只是留下了一些汽油滴下的痕迹
Only he left a few tale trail drops of petroleum.

1355
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:48,900
因此我们会在那里闻到柴油的味道
The smell we talked of diesel on the floor boards.

1356
01:19:49,370 --> 01:19:52,309
那场火真正的目的
The real target of those flames

1357
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:55,850
并不是你妻子的照片或是遗嘱
wasn't your wife's photographs or even her will,

1358
01:19:56,590 --> 01:20:00,700
而是档案柜里的账目记录
it was the accounts records housed in the filing cabinet.

1359
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:03,310
这为你争取了不少时间
That bought you some time,

1360
01:20:03,780 --> 01:20:06,470
但你知道 克里斯提安不会这样放过你
but you knew Christian couldn't be put off forever.

1361
01:20:07,290 --> 01:20:11,570
你就打算在他下次来斯托尼盖特时杀他灭口
And so you were ready to silence him when he next came up to Stonygates

1362
01:20:12,550 --> 01:20:15,209
这个改造工厂花光了我们所有积蓄
The reform facility ate up all we had.

1363
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:17,740
那些地产 还有那些无休止的特权
The buildings. The endless privileges.

1364
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:21,040
我只有这样...
It was the only way ...

1365
01:20:21,670 --> 01:20:23,450
我已经把所有东西都砸了进去
I poured everything in it.

1366
01:20:24,270 --> 01:20:25,820
信托基金
The Trust.

1367
01:20:26,170 --> 01:20:27,720
我自己的财产
My own fortune.

1368
01:20:29,510 --> 01:20:31,530
这是最后一搏了
It was the last resort.

1369
01:20:31,930 --> 01:20:33,590
你也明白 不是吗
You see that, don't you?

1370
01:20:34,730 --> 01:20:37,450
这是我能唯一想到的 让你开心点的方法了
It was the only way I knew to make you happy.

1371
01:20:38,420 --> 01:20:40,010
你若发现...
If you found out...

1372
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:46,690
你不必向我证明你如何爱我
You didn't have to prove yourself to me.

1373
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:49,830
但约翰尼・雷斯塔瑞克正虎视眈眈
With Johnny Restarick waiting in the wings?

1374
01:20:49,990 --> 01:20:52,940
- 约翰尼 - 我看到了他的信
- Johnny? - I saw his letters to you.

1375
01:20:53,450 --> 01:20:55,669
- 那个人十分疯狂 - 不
- The man was unstoppable. - No!

1376
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:57,129
你才是我的丈夫
You are my husband.

1377
01:20:57,140 --> 01:20:59,210
你知道一些 不是吗
You knew a little, didn't you?

1378
01:21:00,180 --> 01:21:02,120
我在想 当约翰尼...
I wondered. When Johnny...

1379
01:21:02,630 --> 01:21:05,009
他还没有套到什么话
His new friendship had to be scotched,

1380
01:21:05,020 --> 01:21:07,160
他和惠特斯特布尔・欧尼斯特的朋友关系
before Whitstable Ernest 

1381
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:07,660
就结束了
let something slip.

1382
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:11,730
生蚝里混入的砒霜使他坏不了事
The arsenic in the oysters kept Ernest out of the harm's way.

1383
01:21:12,790 --> 01:21:14,220
那约翰尼呢
And Johnny?

1384
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:17,600
我想是一次算好时间的谋杀
A spontaneous killing, I would wager,

1385
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:20,720
当他在后台的照明设备下面时
while he was under that lightening operators ...

1386
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:25,880
有人听那男主角的一句台词便下手
.. waiting for a word with the leading man.

1387
01:21:27,060 --> 01:21:29,500
但你一直在舞台上
But you were on stage all the time.

1388
01:21:30,830 --> 01:21:32,450
如果不是你...
If it wasn't you ...

1389
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:38,710
艾德加・罗森
Edgar Lawson!

1390
01:21:39,050 --> 01:21:40,450
父亲
Father?

1391
01:21:41,250 --> 01:21:42,720
- 艾德加 - 警官快去
- Edgar! - Sargeant!

1392
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:47,890
- 艾德加 - 孩子
- Edgar! - Son!

1393
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:14,160
艾德加
Edgar!

1394
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:38,260
快点 快
Come on! quick!

1395
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:41,680
伙计们 赶紧
Hurry up, lads!

1396
01:22:48,210 --> 01:22:49,530
快
Quick!

1397
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:02,950
继续找
Keep looking!

1398
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:33,320
- 你知道艾德加的事情吗 - 我在想
- Did you know? - I wondered.

1399
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,879
刘易斯总是很快就结束了
Lewis was always quick to end

1400
01:23:35,890 --> 01:23:39,340
任何有关于艾德加身世的讨论
any idle talk about Edgar's true provenance.

1401
01:23:39,830 --> 01:23:42,399
再看看艾德加自己
And then there was Edgar himself.

1402
01:23:42,410 --> 01:23:46,199
他的疯癫... 看起来不太让人信服
His madness... seemed unconvincing somehow,

1403
01:23:46,210 --> 01:23:50,159
似乎在寻找一个失踪的父亲 我很遗憾
the quest for a missing father. I. .. I'm so sorry.

1404
01:23:50,170 --> 01:23:52,510
刘易斯 为什么他不直接告诉我呢
Oh, Lewis. Why didn't he just tell me?

1405
01:23:53,050 --> 01:23:55,499
可能他怕你不会接受
Perhaps too scared you wouldn't approve.

1406
01:23:55,510 --> 01:23:57,220
就以我自己这样的经历吗
What, with my check at history?

1407
01:23:59,300 --> 01:24:01,880
至少他自己为了救他的孩子而死
Well, at least he died trying to save his own son.

1408
01:24:03,210 --> 01:24:05,340
也许能给人带来一点安慰
I try to take some comfort in that.

1409
01:24:07,090 --> 01:24:12,050
也许这意味着他终究是个善良的人
And maybe that means he was a good man, after all?

1410
01:24:12,790 --> 01:24:14,840
好像英勇地战死一般
Like being bulleted, back in the war.

1411
01:24:15,410 --> 01:24:19,029
- 小心点 - 不能那么弄
- Be careful with that. - I wouldn't do that if I were you.

1412
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:21,760
这是一个暗门 来 我给你看
It's part of a hidden door. Here, let me show you.

1413
01:24:25,020 --> 01:24:27,150
- 亲爱的 帮我一下 - 当然
- Oh, help me, darling. - Of course.

1414
01:24:33,260 --> 01:24:34,690
真是聪明
So clever.

1415
01:24:37,870 --> 01:24:40,449
简 走吧 我们已经够迟的了
Come on, Jane. We're late enough already.

1416
01:24:40,460 --> 01:24:42,010
飞机四点起飞
The flight leaves at four,

1417
01:24:42,060 --> 01:24:44,719
飞行员可不会等我们
and, apparently, the pilot refuses to wait.

1418
01:24:44,730 --> 01:24:45,409
当然
Of course.

1419
01:24:45,420 --> 01:24:47,830
你确定不改主意了吗
Are you sure you won't change your mind?

1420
01:24:47,910 --> 01:24:50,179
这个时候的曼哈顿真的很棒
Manhattan is fabulous at this time of the year.

1421
01:24:50,190 --> 01:24:51,880
谢谢你 鲁思 我确定
Quite sure, thank you, Ruth.

1422
01:24:55,580 --> 01:24:57,520
英国的破电路
Damn british wiring.

1423
01:25:20,410 --> 01:25:21,700
马上来
One minute.

1424
01:25:28,650 --> 01:25:29,850
该死
Damn!

1425
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:31,680
瓦利
Wally!

1426
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:34,400
你去哪了
Where've you been?

1427
01:25:34,990 --> 01:25:36,510
你在这做什么
What're you doing here?

1428
01:25:37,290 --> 01:25:38,530
你错了
You're wrong.

1429
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:41,760
我查了一下
I looked it up.

1430
01:25:43,170 --> 01:25:45,340
这是红木 不是巨杉树
They're red-wood, not Wellingtonia.

1431
01:25:47,910 --> 01:25:49,690
这刺太硬
The bur's too tough.

1432
01:25:52,020 --> 01:25:53,180
看见没
See?

1433
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:57,530
- 看见没 - 瓦利 别这样
- See? - Wally! Don't!

1434
01:25:57,540 --> 01:25:59,130
停下
Stop!

1435
01:26:02,940 --> 01:26:04,370
瓦利
Wally.

1436
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:15,690
现在你让我伤心了
Now you've got me started.

1437
01:26:18,290 --> 01:26:20,020
- 瓦利 我... - 别说了
- Wally, I... - No.

1438
01:26:21,850 --> 01:26:23,480
都安排好了
It's all settled.

1439
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:29,080
那就重新安排
Then unsettle it.

1440
01:26:31,620 --> 01:26:34,939
笑什么 你为什么总是这样
What? Why do you always do that?

1441
01:26:34,950 --> 01:26:35,632
对不起 
I'm sorry. 

1442
01:26:35,633 --> 01:26:37,339
在我想说些什么的时候开始笑
Laughing when I'm trying to say something.

1443
01:26:37,350 --> 01:26:38,280
我...
I...

1444
01:26:40,270 --> 01:26:43,330
我不敢相信你还喜欢我
I just can't believe you still want me.

1445
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:46,840
你还没明白吗
Don't you get it?

1446
01:26:47,730 --> 01:26:49,410
我从来没有... 
There was never...

1447
01:26:49,411 --> 01:26:51,650
从来没有哪一刻我不...
not a single moment that I...

1448
01:26:52,630 --> 01:26:54,100
不怎样
When you what?

1449
01:26:56,110 --> 01:26:57,430
过来
Come here.

1450
01:27:10,420 --> 01:27:13,040
蜜儿 亲爱的
Mil! Sweetie!

1451
01:27:13,430 --> 01:27:16,109
- 你来的正好 - 是吗
- You look just the ticket! - Do I?

1452
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:17,520
不想来试试吗
Fancy a spin?

1453
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:25,710
不用了 谢谢
Thank you, but no. I don't think so.

1454
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:28,550
再也不会了
Not anymore.

1455
01:27:32,090 --> 01:27:34,600
蜜儿 蜜儿
Mil! Mil!

1456
01:27:54,710 --> 01:27:56,090
亲爱的简阿姨
My dear aunt Jane,

1457
01:27:56,350 --> 01:27:58,359
我希望你知道我们怀俄明州这边
I wanted you to know that we seem to be prospering,

1458
01:27:58,370 --> 01:28:00,290
快要丰收了
after a fashion, here in Wyoming.

1459
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:03,680
我还是打算成为一个美国女孩
I decided to be an american girl, after all.

1460
01:28:03,830 --> 01:28:06,360
他们说在那里 你来自何方不重要
They say that here, it's not where you come from that accounts,

1461
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:08,310
重要的是你如何面对你的人生
it's what you make, with the life you were given.

1462
01:28:08,980 --> 01:28:12,660
在过去经历了那么多以后
After all this past, after all that's gone before,

1463
01:28:13,140 --> 01:28:16,310
我梦想得到的这些是否太过奢侈呢
Is it too much to dream that such a thing is possible?

1464
01:28:16,440 --> 01:28:18,720
爱你的 吉娜
All our love, Gina
