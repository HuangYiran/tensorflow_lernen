1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:03,200
Previously on Revolution...

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,120
What the hell is happening to me?

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,410
I'll come quietly! Just leave her alone!

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,680
I'd like to pick your
brain about the nanotech.

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,450
Aaron,it's only a matter of
time before Horn is onto you.

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,860
We gotta get you out of town.

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,040
Aaron!

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,670
Well,we have the doctor
to thank for finding you.

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,910
Searching the boatyard was his idea.

10
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:27,060
Gene?

11
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,110
I know you all are in
there. Get 'em out,Gene.

12
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,750
Let me stay behind.

13
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,420
We're working for the Patriots.

14
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,860
- So what now?
- Kill them all for your mother.

15
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,770
- You said your husband was Patriot High Command.
- What do you want?

16
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,340
Your wife... is an enemy of
the United States of America.

17
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,630
- You know how much trouble you're in now?
- I'm sorry.

18
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:47,920
Gotta be realistic.

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,500
Roger,no.

20
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:56,420
I have a tumor growing
in my brain. I need you.

21
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:57,870
Aaron!

22
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,900
- Maybe you can heal someone else.
- Stop!

23
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:02,900
No!

24
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:12,020
I saw an access door on the
roof when I was up there.

25
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,510
So we go in up top,fight our way down.

26
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,120
There's gotta be 20 men in that bunker,

27
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,940
and that's if we get
past the 20 outside.

28
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,370
Aaron and Cynthia are in there,
probably your grandfather too.

29
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:23,180
What choice do we have?

30
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,240
Miles... You okay?

31
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,080
- Ready?
- Yeah.

32
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,590
Miles?

33
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,940
What is it?

34
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,250
What the hell?

35
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,870
Are they dead?

36
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,160
Out cold.

37
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,940
Well,front door works too,I guess.

38
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,850
What the hell happened?

39
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,800
Were they gassed?

40
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,330
You haven't seen my dad,have you?

41
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,300
No. He's not here.

42
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,100
Hey,Miles.

43
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:54,590
Aaron was here.

44
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:57,550
- How do you know?
- I know the boots he wears.

45
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,550
His prints go that way.

46
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,150
So... Aaron knocks out 40 guys...

47
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,020
gets up,just strolls out of here.

48
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:15,290
Seriously... what the hell's going on?

49
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,500
It's this way.

50
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,780
That's not ominous at all.

51
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,780
You think the Patriots made this?

52
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:47,500
Come on.

53
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,610
We're out of time,Rachel.

54
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,520
Wait,what about dad?

55
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,650
Now,let's go!

56
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:04,390

00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:23,110
I said I'd bring you on my
security detail, not your son.

60
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:27,520
Jason only wants what I
want... to be of service.

61
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,080
He's an escapee from
a reeducation center.

62
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,300
We all have skeletons in our closet.

63
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,700
Don't we,sir?

64
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,110
I helped you with yours,

65
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:42,370
I expect you to help me with mine.

66
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,440
Smile,boy.

67
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,400
We're going to the White House.

68
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,520
Sir.

69
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:22,140
Best we can tell,Pittman just walked out

70
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:25,400
through the tunnels,took
his girlfriend with him.

71
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,620
The amazing Aaron Pittman.

72
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,890
No end to the surprises with that one.

73
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,390
Where are we?

74
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,850
Outside the town walls.

75
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,970
My question is,what are the Patriots
doing with a tunnel like that?

76
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,520
All right,I got the
trail. It's this way.

77
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,550
This weather seem a
touch unseasonal to you?

78
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:08,070
So... Aaron houdinis
himself out of the bunker,

79
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,950
now this?

80
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:13,570
More of your nano garbage,isn't it?

81
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,090
Rachel?

82
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,700
- I gotta go back.
- What?

83
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,770
You and Charlie,go get Aaron.

84
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,090
- I've gotta go get my dad.
- Then I'm coming with you.

85
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:33,090
Uh,listen,both of you!

86
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,260
They're gonna be looking for Aaron.

87
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,070
Which means we gotta find him first.

88
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,430
- Then we'll go after Gene.
- Miles.

89
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,970
All this X-Files weirdness...

90
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,440
not my thing.

91
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,040
Totally out of my depth here.

92
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,410
I need your help.

93
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,960
What if he's dead?

94
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,960
If he is...

95
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,020
he did it to save us...

96
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,790
so that we could save Aaron.

97
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,850
And I'm sorry.

98
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,000
See what I mean?

99
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,310
We don't have a choice.

100
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:57,590
{\a6}****

101
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,260
Cynthia.

102
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,080
Oh,thank God.

103
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,640
You're okay.

104
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,460
Did I do that?

105
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,470
Hello?

106
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,460
What are you doing here?

107
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,420
I'm having a heart attack.
That's what I'm doing here.

108
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,110
What are you doing here?

109
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:53,840
I live here.

110
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:01,760
Well,did you... see
who brought us in here?

111
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,640
You did.

112
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,420
You walked in on your own.

113
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:11,140
She was in your arms.
Don't you remember?

114
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,350
No.

115
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:34,000
Damn it. I lost the trail.

116
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:37,010
All right,well,find it.

117
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:40,590
Yeah,you know what,Miles,if you can
do a better job, please,go for it.

118
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,290
- Shot fired!
- Over there!

119
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,540
Come on.

120
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,920
- Hold it right there!
- Freeze!

121
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,140
I'm Batman.

122
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,020
Come on.

123
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:26,640
Go!

124
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:45,860
Where's your father?

125
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,040
He went up front to see
why we're stopping. Sir.

126
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,780
Is she gonna be okay?

127
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,590
I hope so.

128
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:47,610
Have I seen you around town?

129
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,160
No.

130
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:52,040
'Cause you look familiar to me.

131
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,590
Where are your parents?

132
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:57,330
Been looking for them.

133
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,640
Where are you from?

134
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,090
Oklahoma.

135
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:07,690
Town called Spring City. Ever been?

136
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:10,110
- No.
- You should go.

137
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,110
It's got the second biggest
ball of twine in the world.

138
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,220
Yeah.

139
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:20,020
Yeah,I'll do that.

140
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,880
Sir. Sir.

141
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,000
What?

142
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,770
I said maybe we should
wait until the fog lifts,

143
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,770
until the scouts report in.

144
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,640
No.

145
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:02,510
Go get a horse,ride back to town.

146
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:07,040
Tell Truman to send everyone
he's got. I mean everyone.

147
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,960
I need to find Pittman now.

148
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,170
I'm out of time.

149
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,250
Out of time?

150
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,720
Go.

151
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,590
What the hell happened,Bass?

152
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:35,050
Keep your voice
down,they're right outside.

153
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,570
You were supposed to
be looking after Aaron.

154
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,570
I did the best I could.

155
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:41,240
Well,your best sucks.

156
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:44,040
- Now we gotta go find him.
- Actually,no,no.

157
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,130
You can take your fat friend, and
these Patriots for that matter,

158
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,650
and you can shove 'em.

159
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:50,730
I thought you wanted revenge.

160
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,420
What I want?

161
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,670
The reason I saved you...

162
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:57,930
what I care about is my son,Miles.

163
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,440
You hid him from me.

164
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,650
Now you tell me where he is,

165
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,370
and I'm out of here.

166
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,200
What?

167
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,620
Holy hell.

168
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,620
It's infected.

169
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:27,620
You think?

170
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,880
You're burning up,you
moron. You need a doctor.

171
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,100
Doctor?

172
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,210
They've got Rachel's dad.

173
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:37,450
Look. I'm having a hard
time swinging a sword.

174
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,150
I need you.

175
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,800
No,you need help.

176
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,570
I gotta go find Aaron.

177
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:45,060
Look,Aaron... Aaron...
he's nice and all.

178
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,340
But he's not worth dying over.

179
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,650
I disagree.

180
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:56,890
My God,you really have gone soft.

181
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:00,060
You're like a puppy holding a kitten.

182
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,680
Just help me,okay?

183
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:06,570
And I swear I'll tell
you where your son is.

184
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:09,570
No,this is not my problem.

185
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,570
Yes,it is.

186
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:14,860
Because if you don't help me,

187
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:18,420
I will never help you find your kid.

188
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:29,230
Look,mom,we'll go get Aaron,
and then we'll get grandpa,okay?

189
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,230
He'll be all right.

190
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:33,480
Yeah.

191
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:38,840
I just... th... the way we left things,

192
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:42,310
what I almost did to him...

193
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,390
I need to see him.

194
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:49,480
- I gotta talk to him,I have to tell him.
- You will.

195
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,040
I love you,Charlie.

196
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,830
We may die tomorrow.

197
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:03,520
We'll probably die today.

198
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:05,860
Just,uh...

199
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,010
I need you to know that I love you.

200
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:19,520
I love you too.

201
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:27,760
Well? What are we waiting for?

202
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,340
Let's go find "Stay Puft".

203
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,260
{\a6}****

204
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,840
Miles!

205
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:51,130
That's it? No good-bye?

206
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,770
We can't keep doing this.

207
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,160
He's my brother.

208
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:13,880
And Ben's... smart.

209
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,610
And he's good,he's a good man.

210
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,400
Better for you.

211
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,870
So,uh...

212
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,680
You should go start a family.

213
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,990
You know,be happy.

214
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:44,620
Is that how you really feel?

215
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:51,100
Yeah.

216
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,530
Because all you have to do...

217
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:57,000
is tell me you love me.

218
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,410
And I will leave him,

219
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:02,230
and I will wait for you.

220
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,580
I don't love you.

221
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:20,450
I don't believe you.

222
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,830
I'm sorry,Rachel.

223
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,260
I gotta go.

224
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,530
Sir! I found him.

225
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,890
Get the United States
back on its feet again.

226
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:42,920
We're proud of this job
that we're doing here.

227
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:46,290
- It's gonna happen soon.
- Please will you excuse me for a moment?

228
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,460
Of course.

229
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,940
Seem a little quiet to you?

230
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:39,250
The Patriots are gone.

231
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,220
They must have found Aaron.

232
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,220
They went this way.

233
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,100
Hey.

234
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,330
Cyn,hi.

235
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:04,960
We're gonna get out of here,okay?

236
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,180
No. Don't go. Not yet.

237
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:11,800
All right,well,come with us. But we
gotta get as far away from here as we can.

238
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,800
I need to talk to you.

239
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,260
Kid,I am sorry. I don't have
time for a chat right now.

240
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,720
Aaron,who are you talking to?

241
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,030
The kid.

242
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,810
What kid?

243
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:32,340
The one standing right there.

244
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:38,850
Aaron,there's nobody there.

245
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:46,200
We fixed her. We
brought you back to life.

246
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,610
We just wanna talk.

247
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,340
- Aaron,stop!
- We're leaving.

248
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,140
- You saw a kid?
- I didn't see anything.

249
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,600
Aaron,tell me!

250
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:08,310
I saw a boy.

251
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:12,780
And he said he brought me back to life.

252
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:15,430
And he said he wanted to talk to me.

253
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,550
Go talk to him.

254
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,660
Wait,what?

255
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:29,360
Look,these last few weeks
have been truly awful.

256
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:31,740
But I still think...

257
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:35,950
I have to believe that everything
happens for a reason,even this,

258
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:39,240
and you need to face it.

259
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:43,120
I don't think I can.

260
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,670
I'm scared too.

261
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:48,670
But you are gonna go back in there,

262
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:51,510
and I'm gonna be right beside you.

263
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:59,900
You're crazier than I am.

264
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:01,900
That's why you love me.

265
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:16,660
When I saw you on that platform,
I thought I was seeing a ghost.

266
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,760
Tom,is...

267
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:25,080
- is Jason...
- he's here.

268
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,490
With me.

269
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,700
Good.\

270
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,200
You wanna tell me what happened?

271
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:43,330
Atlanta started to fall,so
I headed south with Theresa.

272
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:47,290
We found a house in Sandersville.

273
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:49,930
I was there when the bombs fell.

274
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,000
Well...

275
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,160
Thank God you're alive.

276
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,160
Go ahead.

277
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:02,550
Say it.

278
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:08,590
Who is this ass-clown you're with?

279
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:14,250
He's my husband.

280
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:19,270
I thought you were dead,Tom.

281
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:22,350
I was scared,and I was hungry.

282
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,350
And so marry him...

283
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,380
is what I had to do to survive.

284
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,570
Do whatever it takes,right?

285
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,910
What are you doing here?

286
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:44,350
These are the son of a
bitches who dropped the bombs.

287
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:51,370
I was on my way to the White House
to kill the President for you.

288
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:56,230
I love you.

289
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:05,970
You are not killing the President.

290
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:09,990
You're gonna keep your job,

291
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:15,430
and for now, both of us are
gonna keep our mouths shut.

292
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:19,730
What do you have in mind?

293
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,520
We can still get everything we wanted.

294
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:40,980
Hello.

295
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,660
I thought you looked familiar.

296
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:04,400
You're Kevin Donegan...

297
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:08,300
my friend from... third grade?

298
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:12,430
You played Nintendo with
Kevin. Legend of Zelda.

299
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:16,580
How do you know about that?

300
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,970
We're everywhere.

301
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,710
We're in the air,we're in
your head. We know your thinks.

302
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,900
My thinks?

303
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,860
You're the nanotech,aren't you?

304
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:38,660
So what are you telling me?

305
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:42,000
That you're some sort of A.I.?

306
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,640
That you're alive?

307
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:46,470
How?

308
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,370
We woke up. You woke us up.

309
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:57,960
{\a6}****

310
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:02,440
What if we end the world?

311
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:06,270
We won't,Aaron. Do it.

312
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,500
I woke you up?

313
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,690
You made us.

314
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:28,250
I've made a lot of things...

315
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:32,620
but never an A.I. Haley Joel.

316
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:36,830
What is this all about?
What do you want from me?

317
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,940
Have you ever been to
Spring City,Oklahoma?

318
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:42,550
It has the second biggest
ball of twine in the world.

319
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:44,950
No. No riddles.

320
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,280
What is he saying?

321
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,630
I almost went nuts over this,

322
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:52,000
and I want some answers.
I want straight answers.

323
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,680
Why did you bring me back to life?

324
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:59,060
Why did you knock us out
and sleepwalk us over here?

325
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,840
What is this all for?

326
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,950
You made us.

327
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:05,990
We just wanted to help you,that's all.

328
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:09,160
Burning people alive? That helps me?

329
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:12,370
You say "kill" in your head,so we kill.

330
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:15,010
Just because I think it doesn't mean...

331
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:19,510
look,stop killing people.

332
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,250
You wanna help me?

333
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:26,380
You leave me alone. Do you understand?

334
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,590
Go away.

335
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,490
Go.

336
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:37,820
They're here.

337
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:01,710
Cadet?

338
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:09,960
This is Mrs. Doyle.

339
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,680
She's a little turned around.

340
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,510
Can you help her get
back to her husband?

341
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,330
Sir.

342
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,670
- Follow me,Mrs. Doyle.
- Thank you.

343
00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:00,390
Okay. Let's get Aaron.

344
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:39,520
Split up.

345
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:20,210
Aaron,you here?

346
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,690
Miles,are you okay? Miles?

347
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:37,170
- Sorry. I'm sorry.
- What?

348
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,660
What's wrong? You're burning up.

349
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:41,410
Don't freak out.

350
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,510
You gotta go.

351
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,670
Why didn't you tell me?

352
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,250
Well,we kinda had our hands full.

353
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:05,140
I could've helped.

354
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,820
Your dad could've helped.

355
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:11,160
All you can do is act like an idiot,
which is what you're doing right now.

356
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,980
Get out of here. You gotta go.

357
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:16,170
I am so sick of your macho cowboy crap.

358
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:20,030
You are not pushing me away this time.

359
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,540
I am not leaving.

360
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,800
Aaron?

361
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,670
Aaron?

362
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,400
Hey.

363
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:36,110
- I gotta tell you something.
- You can tell me later.

364
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:39,130
No. I'm gonna tell you now...

365
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:42,900
while I still can.

366
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:49,510
I ne... I never should've let you go.

367
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,770
You were always the one.

368
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:02,330
Miles? Hey! Miles.

369
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:05,720
Miles,Miles,Miles. Come
on. Come on,wake up!

370
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,720
Wake up,come on!

371
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,690
Mr. Pittman.

372
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:21,640
I've been looking for you.

373
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,550
Please just let us go.

374
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:37,210
I'd be happy to.

375
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:43,010
First,you get rid of
the tumor in my skull.

376
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,560
I can't.

377
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:49,510
She was bleeding to death.

378
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:51,370
You healed her,why not me?

379
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:53,980
- You don't understand.
- Stop lying!

380
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:59,820
You can't imagine what it feels like...

381
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:03,930
like a knitting needle
jammed in my head.

382
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,690
I'm begging you.

383
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:10,970
Fix me. Now.

384
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,270
Please.

385
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,800
Or I kill her. Please.

386
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,420
No. No.

387
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,570
You came back.

388
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,150
Go. Go!

389
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,570
- Please give me some time.
- I'm out of time.

390
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:32,930
- I'm gonna count to three.
- Kid,where are you?

391
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:34,730
- One...
- I need help,please!

392
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:36,920
No one's coming to save you. Two...

393
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,160
It's not me doing it!

394
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,770
But I think I can figure
it out if you just hold on.

395
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:42,390
- Please!
- I love you.

396
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:43,960
Three.

397
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:52,410
Where were you?

398
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,340
You told me to go away.

399
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:00,520
Kill him.

400
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,200
Kill them all.

401
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:10,360
I don't understand. Why didn't
you just ask me to heal her?

402
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:20,380
Yeah,I want you to heal her.

403
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:25,560
You tell me to leave,then you say come.

404
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:28,670
You say kill,then you
tell me not to kill.

405
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:30,670
You don't make any sense.

406
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:32,670
Listen.

407
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:37,680
I... I want you to heal her.

408
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:47,210
Damn it,I am ordering
you to heal her now!

409
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:50,550
I'm leaving,like you wanted.

410
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:51,970
No!

411
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,970
Wait!

412
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:56,930
Wait!

413
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:10,730
