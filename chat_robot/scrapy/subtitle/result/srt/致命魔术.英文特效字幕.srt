00:01:05,998 --> 00:01:10,367
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Every magic trick consists of three parts or acts.

00:01:11,169 --> 00:01:13,899
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The first part is caIIed the PIedge.

00:01:14,072 --> 00:01:17,303
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The magician shows you something ordinary...

7
00:01:17,476 --> 00:01:20,809
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...a deck of cards, a bird, or a man.

8
00:01:27,419 --> 00:01:29,853
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He shows you this object...

9
00:01:30,022 --> 00:01:32,013
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...perhaps he asks you to inspect it...

10
00:01:33,191 --> 00:01:35,819
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...to see that it is, indeed, reaI.

11
00:01:35,994 --> 00:01:39,122
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, unaItered, normaI.

12
00:01:42,401 --> 00:01:45,336
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But of course, it probabIy isn't.

13
00:01:45,804 --> 00:01:49,604
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Where do you think you're going? -l'm part of the bloody act, you fool.

00:02:02,554 --> 00:02:05,022
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The second act is caIIed the Turn.

15
00:02:19,504 --> 00:02:22,473
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The magician takes the ordinary something...

16
00:02:24,409 --> 00:02:27,276
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and makes it do something extraordinary.

17
00:02:32,017 --> 00:02:35,646
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, you're Iooking for the secret, but you won't find it...

18
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:39,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...because, of course, you're not reaIIy Iooking.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you wouIdn't cIap yet...

22
00:02:51,403 --> 00:02:55,396
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...because making something disappear isn't enough.

23
00:02:56,007 --> 00:02:59,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have to bring it back.

24
00:03:00,645 --> 00:03:04,342
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's why every magic trick has a third act.

25
00:03:04,516 --> 00:03:06,074
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The hardest part.

26
00:03:06,651 --> 00:03:10,087
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The part we caII the Prestige.

00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:24,996
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Prestige. And did Robert Angier, the Great Danton, your employer...

28

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...get to that final part of his trick that night?

29
00:03:27,973 --> 00:03:29,634
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-No, sir. Something went wrong. -What went wrong?

30
00:03:30,942 --> 00:03:34,434
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l saw someone making their way below stage.

31

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l followed him.

32

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}lt was Borden, watching Mr. Angier drown.

33
00:03:39,918 --> 00:03:43,149
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Would you please describe your occupation to the jury, Mr. Cutter?

34

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l'm an engineer.

36
00:03:49,127 --> 00:03:50,116
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, Mr. Cutter...

37
00:03:50,295 --> 00:03:53,458
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...was this water-filled tank beneath the stage...

38
00:03:53,632 --> 00:03:55,395
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...part of Mr. Angier's illusion?

39
00:03:55,567 --> 00:03:56,693
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no. lt was...

00:03:56,868 --> 00:04:00,998
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The tank was brought on for the first trick and then taken off-stage.

41
00:04:01,173 --> 00:04:04,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Borden must have placed it under the trap door after the interval.

42
00:04:04,543 --> 00:04:05,942
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How large was this tank?

43
00:04:06,111 --> 00:04:08,737
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, it's a normal tank for escape underwater,

44
00:04:08,738 --> 00:04:10,707
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}about 4 or 500 gallons.

45
00:04:10,882 --> 00:04:12,247
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do you think Mr. Borden...

46
00:04:12,417 --> 00:04:15,875
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...was able to move the tank under the trap door without anyone noticing?

47
00:04:16,054 --> 00:04:17,817
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's a magician. Ask him.

48

00:04:22,727 --> 00:04:24,217
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Real Transported Man...

50
00:04:24,396 --> 00:04:27,365
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...is one of the most sought-after illusions in this business.

51

53
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:35,997
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How can we know that the tank wasn't some part of the trick that went wrong?

54
00:04:36,808 --> 00:04:38,833
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Cutter, l see your predicament...

00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,274
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but Alfred Borden's life hangs in the balance.

00:04:47,486 --> 00:04:50,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Might this be an acceptable compromise?

59
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,668
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l'm gonna have to ask you to turn out your pockets.

61
00:05:17,415 --> 00:05:21,408
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The warden saw his show in Manchester last year where he vanished into thin air.

62
00:05:21,586 --> 00:05:24,555

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...it'II take much Ionger to unraveI the rest of Borden's secrets.

103
00:08:04,182 --> 00:08:08,744
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See, the cipher in his notebook is unIocked by a singIe word...

104
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,401
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but it wiII stiII take months to transIate his writing

105
00:08:12,402 --> 00:08:14,722
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and to know his mind.

114
00:09:26,364 --> 00:09:29,891
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, the peak is closed, sir, for scientific experimentation.

115
00:09:30,068 --> 00:09:33,299

122

00:11:00,758 --> 00:11:04,626
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He made a machine for a colleague of mine sometime ago.

126
00:11:04,796 --> 00:11:08,288
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Can you get me a meeting with him? -lmpossible, l'm afraid.

127

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l'm sorry, Mr. Angier.

135
00:11:37,762 --> 00:11:41,596
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was just days after he first met me.

136
00:11:43,568 --> 00:11:46,628
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We were two young men at the start of a great career.

137
00:11:46,804 --> 00:11:49,329
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two young men devoted to an iIIusion.

00:11:49,507 --> 00:11:51,668
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two young men who never intended to hurt anyone.

00:11:51,843 --> 00:11:56,303
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Which of you brave souls is willing to bind this lovely young woman?

140
00:12:08,626 --> 00:12:09,991
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}lf you would tie her wrists.

141
00:12:10,795 --> 00:12:15,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bind her feet around the ankle.

142
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,791
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are either of you two gentlemen sailors?

143
00:12:17,969 --> 00:12:19,664
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-No. -No.

144
00:12:20,571 --> 00:12:23,972
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l'm sure you can both tie a strong knot.

145
00:13:27,038 --> 00:13:30,337
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's complacent, he's predictable, he's boring.

146
00:13:30,508 --> 00:13:33,102
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l mean, Milton has gotten success, whatever that means...

00:13:33,277 --> 00:13:36,041
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and now he's scared. He won't take any risks at all.

148
00:13:36,214 --> 00:13:38,944
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l mean, he's squandering the goodwill of the audience...

149
00:13:39,117 --> 00:13:42,052
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-...with tired, second-rate tricks. -They're old favorites.

150
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,903
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Favorites? Give me something fresh.

151
00:13:43,904 --> 00:13:45,587
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He won't even try a bullet catch.

152
00:13:45,757 --> 00:13:47,349
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A bullet catch is suicide.

153
00:13:47,525 --> 00:13:51,427
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All it takes is some smart-ass volunteer to put a button in the barrel.

154
00:13:51,596 --> 00:13:53,962
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Fine. Use a plant. -You can't for every trick.

155
00:13:54,132 --> 00:13:56,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-There'd be no seats left for the punters. -No bullet catch.

156
00:13:57,101 --> 00:14:01,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whatever. The point is that a real magician tries to invent something new...

157
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:04,403
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...that other magicians are gonna scratch their heads over.

158
00:14:04,575 --> 00:14:06,736
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then you sell it to him for a small fortune.

159
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:09,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l suppose you have such a trick.

160
00:14:10,081 --> 00:14:12,515
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Actually, l do. -Would you care to sell it to me?

161
00:14:12,683 --> 00:14:14,207
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. No one else could do my trick.

162
00:14:14,385 --> 00:14:16,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Any trick can be duplicated, right? -Wrong.

163
00:14:16,587 --> 00:14:19,488
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}lf Mr. Borden has invented his masterpiece...

164
00:14:19,657 --> 00:14:21,818
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...it might be only he's prepared to do it.

165
00:14:22,193 --> 00:14:24,354
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Milton is a great showman, but Borden is right.

166
00:14:24,529 --> 00:14:26,087
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He won't get his hands dirty.

167

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}lf you wanna see what it takes to make real magic, go to the Tenley.

168
00:14:30,835 --> 00:14:33,531
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a Chinaman there, and he really has what it takes.

169
00:14:33,704 --> 00:14:35,934
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Chung Ling Soo. -Pricey. l can't afford that.

170
00:14:36,107 --> 00:14:37,665
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l know the bloke on the door.

171
00:14:37,842 --> 00:14:40,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You two go and see that show...

172
00:14:40,311 --> 00:14:42,211
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and whichever one of you can tell me...

173
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,245
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...how he does the goldfish-bowl trick...

174
00:14:45,783 --> 00:14:47,546
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Which is? -Ten minutes on-stage...

175
00:14:47,718 --> 00:14:49,515
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...with my old friend Mr. Ackerman.

176
00:14:49,687 --> 00:14:51,018
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Really? -Who's Ackerman?

177
00:14:51,189 --> 00:14:53,282
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The top theatrical agent in London.

178

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}lt's the wrong knot. Like l said, the Langford double will hold tighter.

182
00:15:08,706 --> 00:15:12,301
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Langford double isn't a wet knot. lt's too dangerous.

183

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}lf the rope swells up, she won't slip it.

184

185
00:15:18,049 --> 00:15:19,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Borden, he said no.

186
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:21,882
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, well, you know knots better than me, do you?

187
00:15:22,053 --> 00:15:23,953
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, no more mistakes.

188
00:15:24,422 --> 00:15:26,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. Yeah, do you? You wanna take over?

189
00:15:26,891 --> 00:15:29,689
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Just leave it. -l didn't think so.

190
00:15:33,998 --> 00:15:36,762
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Hey, Cutter, where's he from? -Where are you from?

00:15:36,934 --> 00:15:39,146
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-He shifts props for virgil at the hall.

192
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:41,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Aren't you worried he'll steal your tricks?

193
00:15:41,372 --> 00:15:43,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-He doesn't deal in methods. -How do you know?

194
00:15:43,841 --> 00:15:48,938
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because l hired him to find out how virgil does the orange trick.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The birdcage can't be our climax. Everybody knows it.

00:35:43,573 --> 00:35:47,441
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You gotta get your hands dirty if you're gonna achieve the impossible.

00:41:30,186 --> 00:41:31,983
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, and if you need some inspiration...

501
00:41:32,154 --> 00:41:35,146
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...there's a technical exposition at the Albert Hall this week.

502
00:41:35,324 --> 00:41:37,986
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Engineers, scientists, you know?

503
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,323
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That sort of thing captures a public's imagination.

504
00:41:58,447 --> 00:42:01,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mind if l join you? Tesla sends me down here during the storms.

505
00:42:01,951 --> 00:42:05,079
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perfect excuse to come join the Great Danton for a drink.

506
00:42:06,288 --> 00:42:08,085
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two of them.

507
00:42:08,624 --> 00:42:11,149
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Beautiful, isn't it, huh? God, l miss New York though.

508
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:13,693
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-So why are you here? -The lightning lives here.

509
00:42:13,863 --> 00:42:16,957
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And not much else. Our work is secret.

510
00:42:17,733 --> 00:42:19,496
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}ls that a cipher?

511

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}lt's a rotating transposition that shifts every day of the diary.

512
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,105
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Simple, but time-consuming to translate,

513
00:42:27,106 --> 00:42:28,674
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}even when you have the five-letter keyword.

514
00:42:28,844 --> 00:42:30,607
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Which is?

00:42:32,848 --> 00:42:36,784
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have a circle of trust with someone whose diary you stole?

517
00:42:36,952 --> 00:42:37,976
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe l bought it.

518
00:42:38,821 --> 00:42:41,483
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you're hoping to find a great secret in there.

519

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l've already found it. That's why l'm here.

00:42:52,134 --> 00:42:54,625
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tesla built one for another magician.

521
00:42:54,804 --> 00:42:58,069
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Why would you want the same thing? -Call it a professional rivalry.

522
00:42:58,607 --> 00:43:02,873
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Tesla has built unusual machines for unusual people.

523
00:43:03,045 --> 00:43:04,637
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But he would never talk about it.

524

00:43:22,431 --> 00:43:24,092
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's gonna believe you?

530
00:43:25,401 --> 00:43:27,426
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not long now.

531
00:43:27,603 --> 00:43:30,003
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our equipment requires a great deal of current.

532
00:43:30,172 --> 00:43:31,929
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tesla electrified the town in exchange for

00:43:36,212 --> 00:43:39,272
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We do our tests when the townspeople are asleep.

535
00:43:39,448 --> 00:43:42,042
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Tesla doesn't wanna scare anyone.

00:44:03,072 --> 00:44:04,562
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Exactly.

538

00:50:19,014 --> 00:50:20,845
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's conducting the electricity?

631
00:51:09,364 --> 00:51:11,059
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What you want is simply expensive.

632

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Angier, have you considered the cost of such a machine?

638
00:51:27,015 --> 00:51:28,846
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Price is not an object.

00:51:29,518 --> 00:51:32,885
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perhaps not, but have you considered the cost?

00:52:46,828 --> 00:52:51,231
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cutter said it would be all right till we get another booking. What are you doing?

657
00:52:52,267 --> 00:52:53,632
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Research.

658
00:52:53,802 --> 00:52:58,239

00:53:57,999 --> 00:54:00,832
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just a rubber ball, yes? Thank you.

675
00:54:01,002 --> 00:54:03,493
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just a rubber ball, no.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not normal. Not a normal rubber ball.

00:54:24,759 --> 00:54:25,748
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Was it good?

680
00:54:30,799 --> 00:54:32,699
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}lt was the greatest magic trick l've ever seen.

681
00:54:39,374 --> 00:54:40,898
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did they appIaud when you saw it?

682
00:54:41,076 --> 00:54:43,101
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The trick was too good, it was too simple.

683
00:54:43,278 --> 00:54:46,338
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-The audience hardly had time to see it. -He's a dreadful magician.

00:54:46,515 --> 00:54:49,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, he's a wonderful magician. He's a dreadful showman.

685
00:54:49,217 --> 00:54:51,447
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He doesn't know how to dress it up, how to sell...

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-How does he do it? -Uses a double.

687
00:54:53,421 --> 00:54:56,015
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no, it's too simple. This is a complex illusion.

688
00:54:56,191 --> 00:54:58,591
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You only say that because you don't know the method.

689

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The same man comes out of that second cabinet.

693

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}lt's the same man.

00:55:11,039 --> 00:55:13,439
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He wears padded gloves to hide his damaged fingers...

695
00:55:13,608 --> 00:55:15,439
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but if you look closely you can tell.

00:55:18,246 --> 00:55:20,874
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He doesn't know how to sell it to an audience, but l do.

697
00:55:21,049 --> 00:55:23,381
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, well, we can use it as a climax to the show.

698
00:55:23,818 --> 00:55:25,683
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

699
00:55:25,854 --> 00:55:29,085
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The man stole my life, l'm gonna steal his trick.

700
00:55:29,257 --> 00:55:32,454
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-We gotta find someone who looks like you. -He doesn't use a double.

00:55:32,627 --> 00:55:35,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Robert, l don't know how Borden does the trick, so either...

702
00:55:36,131 --> 00:55:39,498
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You either wait for him to retire and buy the secret...

703
00:55:39,668 --> 00:55:41,431
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...or you listen to how l would do it.

704
00:55:41,603 --> 00:55:46,506
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the only way that l know how to do it is to find you a bloody good double.

705
00:55:47,442 --> 00:55:49,069
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right.

706
00:55:50,345 --> 00:55:52,836
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take a good look. Let's get out there and find me.

707
00:55:55,050 --> 00:55:56,984
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look. Look.

708
00:56:01,089 --> 00:56:02,681
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's that?

709
00:56:03,858 --> 00:56:06,952
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is for you.

710
00:56:07,128 --> 00:56:08,891
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's this for?

711
00:56:09,064 --> 00:56:10,691
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come here.

712
00:56:15,870 --> 00:56:19,601
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-l asked you last week. You said you... -You caught me in a wrong mood.

713
00:56:19,841 --> 00:56:21,172
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you went over all the...

714
00:56:21,343 --> 00:56:24,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sarah, l'm allowed to change my mind, aren't l?

715
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:28,781
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The act is taking off, soon we'll be in a bigger theater.

716
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:30,178
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Things will work out.

717
00:56:32,621 --> 00:56:34,316
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l can't believe it. Thank you.

718
00:56:34,489 --> 00:56:36,389
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you. lt's beautiful.

719
00:56:43,098 --> 00:56:44,861
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gerry?

720
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:46,392
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Darling, look at you.

721
00:56:46,568 --> 00:56:49,196
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Cutter, Mr. Angier, l'd like you to meet Gerald Root.

722
00:56:54,376 --> 00:56:57,743
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A pleasure. Pleasure to meet you fine gentlemen.

723
00:56:58,313 --> 00:57:00,873
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Would you like for me to tell you a little joke? Come here.

724
00:57:04,052 --> 00:57:06,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There we are. Yes?

725
00:57:06,187 --> 00:57:08,212
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you laughing now?

726
00:57:10,425 --> 00:57:13,223
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, dear, l have to take a piss.

727
00:57:14,929 --> 00:57:17,727
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-He's out of his mind. -Of course. He's an out-of-work actor.

728
00:57:17,899 --> 00:57:19,696
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's perfect. He needs a little help...

729
00:57:19,868 --> 00:57:22,701
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but when l get done with him, he could be your brother.

730
00:57:22,871 --> 00:57:25,396
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l don't need him to be my brother, l need him to be me.

731
00:57:25,573 --> 00:57:27,131
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give me a month.

732
00:57:31,079 --> 00:57:32,876
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come around.

733
00:57:34,049 --> 00:57:38,418
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you open the door and....

734
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:47,218
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

735
00:57:51,132 --> 00:57:54,863
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Couldn't you have found a softer one? -Well, it's not for sleeping on.

736
00:57:55,470 --> 00:57:57,404
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So if you come down through there...

737
00:58:00,141 --> 00:58:03,133
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-...does Root go up through there? -Yep.

738
00:58:03,545 --> 00:58:05,274
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}lt's going to be amazing, Robert.

739
00:58:05,814 --> 00:58:09,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, it has to be. Borden's trick is getting noticed.

740
00:58:11,653 --> 00:58:14,019
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The place was packed today.

741
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:17,419
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You went and saw his show again.

742
00:58:17,592 --> 00:58:19,958
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ready to meet yourself, Mr. Angier?

743
00:58:28,603 --> 00:58:30,628
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All l have to do is keep myself drunk...

744
00:58:30,805 --> 00:58:33,069
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and no one will be able to tell the difference.

745
00:58:33,241 --> 00:58:35,141
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have a little faith, sir.

746
00:58:35,310 --> 00:58:40,179
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, would you favor us with a performance, Mr. Root?

747
00:58:44,085 --> 00:58:45,746
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jesus.

748
00:59:00,902 --> 00:59:04,099
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, you would drink too if you knew the world half as well as l do.

749
00:59:07,942 --> 00:59:09,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you think you were unique?

750
00:59:09,677 --> 00:59:12,168
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l have been Caesar. l played Faust.

751
00:59:12,347 --> 00:59:15,316
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How difficult could it possibly be to play the Great Danton?

752
00:59:15,483 --> 00:59:18,646
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can go back to being yourself now, Root, for nothing.

753
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:20,981
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l'd rather be him for now.

754
00:59:21,156 --> 00:59:23,954
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l find it amusing.

755
00:59:27,362 --> 00:59:31,423
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My liege, l did deny no prisoners.

756
00:59:32,567 --> 00:59:34,467
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You look wonderful. -Oh, thank you.

757
00:59:34,636 --> 00:59:37,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Root has to keep a low profile. Anyone sees him, the game's up.

758
00:59:37,906 --> 00:59:40,841
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l don't know how you do these things. l'm not sure l wanna know.

759
00:59:41,242 --> 00:59:43,403
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have you thought what we should call the trick?

760
00:59:43,578 --> 00:59:44,779
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no point in being coy.

761
00:59:44,779 --> 00:59:47,145
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Borden calls his trick "The Transported Man."

762
00:59:51,719 --> 00:59:54,051
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ladies and gentlemen, much of what you've seen tonight...

763
00:59:54,222 --> 00:59:59,455
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...may be termed as illusions or entertaining trifles.

764
01:00:03,064 --> 01:00:04,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alas...

765
01:00:06,367 --> 01:00:08,835
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...l cannot claim this next feat as illusion.

766
01:00:09,737 --> 01:00:10,897
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Watch carefully.

767
01:00:12,373 --> 01:00:14,841
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll see no trickery...

768
01:00:15,310 --> 01:00:16,868
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...for no trickery is employed.

769
01:00:18,046 --> 01:00:21,379
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Merely a technique familiar to certain citizens of the Orient...

770
01:00:21,549 --> 01:00:23,744
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and various holy men of the Himalayas.

771
01:00:27,188 --> 01:00:29,918
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}lndeed, many of you may be familiar with this technique...

772
01:00:30,091 --> 01:00:33,117
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but for those of you who aren't, do not be alarmed...

773
01:00:33,294 --> 01:00:36,354
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...what you're about to see is considered safe.

774
01:01:08,363 --> 01:01:10,422
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To our achievement.

775
01:01:11,132 --> 01:01:13,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The manager says he's never seen a reaction like it.

776
01:01:13,935 --> 01:01:17,166
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At least he got to see it. l spent the ovation hiding under the stage.

777
01:01:17,338 --> 01:01:19,704
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No one cares about the man who disappears into the box.

778
01:01:19,874 --> 01:01:21,637
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They care about the one who comes out.

779
01:01:21,809 --> 01:01:24,778
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-l care about the man in the box. -Thank you.

780
01:01:24,946 --> 01:01:28,143
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l don't know. Maybe... Maybe we could switch before the trick.

781
01:01:28,316 --> 01:01:30,409
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l could be the Prestige and Root ends up below.

782
01:01:30,585 --> 01:01:33,315
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, the anticipation of the trick is everything.

783
01:01:33,488 --> 01:01:36,514
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We need your showmanship to build up the suspense.

784
01:01:36,691 --> 01:01:39,956
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Once Root opens his mouth, it's over. He can't introduce this trick.

785
01:01:40,128 --> 01:01:42,961
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course l can. l'm the Great Danton.

786
01:01:43,131 --> 01:01:46,623
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Root, you bloody fool. Get out of that wardrobe and makeup.

787
01:01:46,801 --> 01:01:49,326
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anyone could walk in here at any minute.

788
01:01:49,504 --> 01:01:51,495
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Congratulations, all.

789
01:01:51,673 --> 01:01:55,234
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Life is not full of these moments, Robbie. We worked hard.

790
01:01:55,410 --> 01:01:57,002
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We need to celebrate properly.

791
01:02:00,682 --> 01:02:03,207
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's wrong? ls it your wife?

792
01:02:03,384 --> 01:02:05,614
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. No, it's the trick. lt isn't good enough.

793
01:02:05,787 --> 01:02:08,984
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Borden's trick is nothing compared to ours. He has no style.

794
01:02:09,157 --> 01:02:12,991
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, he doesn't spend the finale hiding under the stage.

795
01:02:13,161 --> 01:02:14,856
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l need to know how he does it.

796
01:02:15,029 --> 01:02:18,396
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Why? -So l can do it better.

797
01:02:20,602 --> 01:02:23,002
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l need you to go and work for him.

798
01:02:26,140 --> 01:02:27,801
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Work for him? Are you joking?

799
01:02:29,110 --> 01:02:30,236
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll be my spy.

800
01:02:30,411 --> 01:02:32,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We just got our start. You want me to leave?

801
01:02:32,647 --> 01:02:34,672
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's how we advance. Think of it, Olivia.

802
01:02:34,849 --> 01:02:38,478
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got people excited, but imagine what we could do with the real illusion.

803
01:02:38,653 --> 01:02:42,487
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'd have the greatest magic act anyone's ever seen.

804
01:02:42,657 --> 01:02:44,056
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He knows l work for you.

805
01:02:44,225 --> 01:02:47,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Exactly why he'll wanna hire you. He'll want my secret.

806
01:02:47,662 --> 01:02:51,723
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Why would he trust me? -Because you're gonna tell him the truth.

807
01:03:04,112 --> 01:03:05,101
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good girl.

808
01:03:08,349 --> 01:03:11,845
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You must be curious to see what so much money has bought you, Mr. Angier.

809
01:03:12,487 --> 01:03:15,354
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}lt's fitting you should be here for maiden voyage.

810
01:03:15,523 --> 01:03:17,218
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your hat.

811
01:03:24,932 --> 01:03:27,594
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You might wanna stand back.

812
01:03:48,423 --> 01:03:49,412
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l don't understand.

813
01:03:49,590 --> 01:03:51,888
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perhaps it would be best if you left us to it.

814
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:54,187
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-ls there a problem, Mr. Tesla? -No, no, no.

815
01:03:54,362 --> 01:03:55,886
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Come back next week. -Next week?

816
01:03:56,064 --> 01:03:58,157
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Come back... Next week, it'll be fine. -Tesla.

817
01:03:58,332 --> 01:04:01,096
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's just a little temperamental sometimes.

818
01:04:06,007 --> 01:04:08,805
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-lnteresting workshop. -Yeah, we make do.

819
01:04:08,976 --> 01:04:11,308
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-My name is Olivia Wenscombe... -l know who you are.

820
01:04:11,479 --> 01:04:12,776
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You here to steal my show?

821
01:04:12,947 --> 01:04:14,744
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l'm here to give it what it's missing.

822
01:04:14,916 --> 01:04:18,079
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Yeah? What might that be? -Me.

823
01:04:19,654 --> 01:04:23,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l was just saying that, wasn't l, Bernard? Woman's touch.

824
01:04:23,758 --> 01:04:25,589
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-l've left Angier. -All right.

825
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:28,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-l want a job. -Yeah?

826
01:04:28,663 --> 01:04:31,632
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-l know you've no reason to trust me... -Why wouldn't l trust you?

827
01:04:31,799 --> 01:04:35,667
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l mean, you're only the mistress of my enemy. Why wouldn't l trust you?

828
01:04:37,238 --> 01:04:39,138
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Mr. Borden... -Alfred.

829
01:04:41,576 --> 01:04:43,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l'm going to tell you the truth.

830
01:04:43,311 --> 01:04:46,474
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now that is a slippery notion in our line of work...

831
01:04:46,647 --> 01:04:47,944
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...isn't it, Miss Wenscombe?

832
01:04:50,084 --> 01:04:52,644
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l am here because he sent me here.

833
01:04:52,820 --> 01:04:55,288
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He wants me to work for you and steal your secret.

834
01:04:55,456 --> 01:04:57,117
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What does he need my secret for?

835
01:04:57,291 --> 01:04:58,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His trick is top-notch.

836
01:04:59,293 --> 01:05:02,524
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He vanishes and then he reappears on the other side of the stage...

837
01:05:02,697 --> 01:05:06,531
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...mute, overweight and, unless l'm mistaken, very drunk.

838
01:05:06,701 --> 01:05:08,362
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}lt's astonishing. How does he do it?

839
01:05:08,803 --> 01:05:13,672
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And tell me, Olivia, does he enjoy taking his bows under the stage?

840
01:05:13,841 --> 01:05:14,865
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, it's killing him.

841
01:05:15,042 --> 01:05:17,033
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's obsessed with discovering your methods.

842
01:05:17,211 --> 01:05:18,405
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He thinks of nothing else.

843
01:05:18,579 --> 01:05:21,639
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He takes no pleasure in our success, and l've had enough.

844
01:05:21,816 --> 01:05:23,249
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There is no future with him.

845
01:05:25,453 --> 01:05:29,082
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He sent me here to steal your secrets, but l've actually come to offer you his.

846
01:05:29,590 --> 01:05:33,151
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the truth, is it?

847
01:05:37,665 --> 01:05:39,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Think you'd better get dressed, sir.

848
01:05:39,534 --> 01:05:41,764
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Root, you're late and more drunk than usual.

849
01:05:41,936 --> 01:05:44,564
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Now, get down below stairs right away. -No.

850
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:49,234
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, we need to have a little chat, Mr. Cutter.

851
01:05:49,410 --> 01:05:50,434
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have a problem.

852
01:05:50,611 --> 01:05:53,171
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cutter, Borden is performing right across the street.

853
01:05:53,347 --> 01:05:55,975
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah? We have a bigger problem.

854
01:05:57,118 --> 01:06:00,053
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Root. He's realized he can make demands.

855
01:06:00,922 --> 01:06:02,219
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wha...? He's blackmailing us?

856
01:06:02,390 --> 01:06:06,554
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l was surprised, to tell you the truth. lt usually takes them longer to figure it out.

857
01:06:06,727 --> 01:06:09,525
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Well, how much does he want? -Well, it makes no difference.

858
01:06:09,697 --> 01:06:13,098
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-We gotta stop doing the trick. -Stop the trick? Cutter, look at this.

859
01:06:13,267 --> 01:06:15,394
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, look at yesterday's, look at last week...

860
01:06:15,570 --> 01:06:18,937
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...where they said you were the premier stage performer in London.

861
01:06:19,106 --> 01:06:20,664
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not magician, mind you.

862
01:06:20,842 --> 01:06:23,436
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Performer of any kind. -Well, what's your point?

863
01:06:23,611 --> 01:06:25,875
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My point is, Robert, is you've climbed too high...

864
01:06:26,047 --> 01:06:28,242
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...to get away with professional embarrassment.

865
01:06:28,850 --> 01:06:31,648
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't do any tricks we can't control.

866
01:06:34,055 --> 01:06:35,647
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just pay him whatever he wants for now.

867
01:06:35,823 --> 01:06:39,224
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We keep doing the trick until Borden opens and then we'll phase it out.

868
01:06:40,328 --> 01:06:41,761
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right.

869
01:06:44,465 --> 01:06:48,458
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cutter was aIways surprised how fast Root turned bad.

870
01:06:49,036 --> 01:06:53,029
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To what do l owe the pleasure of this rather welcome pint of ale?

871
01:06:53,207 --> 01:06:56,574
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're the Great Danton, aren't you?

872
01:06:56,744 --> 01:07:00,077
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course l am, but don't advertise it because l'll be mobbed with fans.

873
01:07:00,248 --> 01:07:02,148
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We paid him enough to keep him in beers...

874
01:07:02,316 --> 01:07:04,443
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...so you wouIdn't expect him to rock the boat.

875
01:07:04,619 --> 01:07:07,179
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}lndeed, many of you may be familiar with this technique.

876
01:07:07,355 --> 01:07:10,984
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But for those of you who aren't, do not be alarmed...

877
01:07:11,158 --> 01:07:14,184
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...what you're about to see is considered safe.

878
01:07:14,362 --> 01:07:15,659
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And who are you?

879
01:07:15,830 --> 01:07:21,666
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l am a humble admirer and a fellow practitioner.

880
01:07:21,836 --> 01:07:22,996
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}very good.

881
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:35,176
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Another? -Oh, if you insist.

882
01:07:35,349 --> 01:07:37,249
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Another. -l'm not performing tonight.

883
01:07:37,418 --> 01:07:39,147
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, l'm only doing one show...

884
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:42,517
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but to be frank, my people pretty much run things these days.

885
01:07:42,690 --> 01:07:43,782
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get up there!

886
01:07:45,259 --> 01:07:46,248
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get up!

887
01:07:46,427 --> 01:07:48,588
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your illusion, The Transported Man...

888
01:07:48,763 --> 01:07:51,732
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...l'm not claiming to know your methods or anything...

889
01:07:52,433 --> 01:07:58,895
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but l had a similar trick in my act, and l used a double.

890
01:08:00,308 --> 01:08:01,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l see. very good.

891
01:08:01,575 --> 01:08:04,135
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, it was, and then it went bad.

892
01:08:04,312 --> 01:08:09,716
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What l didn't count on, was that when l incorporated this bloke into my act...

893
01:08:09,884 --> 01:08:11,852
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...he had complete power over me.

894
01:08:13,187 --> 01:08:14,654
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Complete power, you say.

895
01:08:32,239 --> 01:08:37,404
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Be very careful giving someone that power over you.

896
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:41,848
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, thank you.

897
01:08:42,016 --> 01:08:44,177
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, thank you for the warning.

898
01:08:46,354 --> 01:08:48,345
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cheers.

01:08:49,090 --> 01:08:51,081
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l cannot claim this next feat as illusion.

900
01:08:51,258 --> 01:08:55,456
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What you're about to see is considered safe.

901
01:09:35,469 --> 01:09:37,664
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Great Danton.

902
01:09:44,045 --> 01:09:45,706
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l apologize.

903
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:49,611
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There simply is too much magic...

904
01:09:49,784 --> 01:09:54,778
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...for my stage at the Pantages across the street.

905
01:09:56,157 --> 01:09:58,691
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Bravo! -Bravo!

906
01:09:58,859 --> 01:10:02,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pardon my intrusion.

907
01:10:02,930 --> 01:10:05,763
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Bravo! -And go easy on the poor chap.

908
01:10:05,933 --> 01:10:09,027
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He does try so very hard.

909
01:10:11,639 --> 01:10:13,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l don't know how Borden found him.

910
01:10:13,641 --> 01:10:15,438
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kept him under wraps, l was careful.

911
01:10:15,609 --> 01:10:17,543
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, well, he did.

912
01:10:18,379 --> 01:10:19,471
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you think it was her?

913
01:10:26,921 --> 01:10:29,549
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You weren't expecting me?

914
01:10:29,723 --> 01:10:32,385
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l was expecting you sooner. Your message said afternoon.

915
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:34,653
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}lt takes a bit for me to get around these days.

916
01:10:35,162 --> 01:10:36,652
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's taken everything from me.

917
01:10:36,831 --> 01:10:39,698
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My wife, my career, now you.

918
01:10:39,867 --> 01:10:40,856
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you mean? You sent me...

919
01:10:41,035 --> 01:10:43,902
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l sent you to steal his secret, not to improve his act.

920
01:10:44,071 --> 01:10:45,538
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-That's my job. -Or fall in love.

921
01:10:45,706 --> 01:10:48,266
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-l did everything you asked! -Yes? Yes?

922
01:10:48,442 --> 01:10:50,967
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Then how does he do it? -Cutter was right, a double.

923
01:10:51,145 --> 01:10:54,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Of course Borden said that. -He didn't say anything. l've seen things.

924
01:10:54,582 --> 01:10:58,348
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Makeup, glasses, wigs. We don't use it for the show, but l've seen it backstage.

925
01:10:58,519 --> 01:11:02,319
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}lt's misdirection. He leaves things around to make you think he's using a double.

926
01:11:02,490 --> 01:11:04,253
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All the time? He doesn't know when l look.

927
01:11:04,425 --> 01:11:06,393
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All the time, Olivia!

928
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,858
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's who he is! That's what it takes!

929
01:11:09,029 --> 01:11:11,395
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He lives his act! Don't you see?

930
01:11:13,534 --> 01:11:16,731
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just because you're sleeping with him doesn't mean he trusts you.

931
01:11:16,904 --> 01:11:19,236
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think you can see everything, don't you?

932
01:11:19,406 --> 01:11:23,035
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But the Great Danton is a blind fool. His notebook.

933
01:11:25,112 --> 01:11:27,239
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You stole it?

934
01:11:27,414 --> 01:11:29,177
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l borrowed it for tonight.

935
01:11:29,350 --> 01:11:31,375
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l thought you could translate it, but now...

936

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-l can't. -You can't?

937
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:35,553
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Olivia, no one can, it's a cipher.

938
01:11:35,723 --> 01:11:38,988
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Even with the keyword it would take months to decode.

939
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:42,095
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-And without the keyword? -Perhaps never.

940
01:11:42,263 --> 01:11:43,662
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-We'll see. -We will not see.

941
01:11:43,831 --> 01:11:46,766
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}lf l don't get that back to him tomorrow, he'll know l took it.

942
01:11:46,934 --> 01:11:49,095
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Leave him. -l can't. He knows where l live.

943
01:11:50,504 --> 01:11:52,438
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is his diary, Olivia.

944
01:11:52,606 --> 01:11:55,234
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All of his secrets are right here in my hands.

945
01:11:56,243 --> 01:11:57,471
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Won't bring your wife back.

946
01:11:57,645 --> 01:12:00,808
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l don't care about my wife, l care about his secret.

947
01:12:13,627 --> 01:12:15,424
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look...

948
01:12:16,597 --> 01:12:18,622
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...l'll go to his workshop and stage a break-in.

949
01:12:18,799 --> 01:12:22,963
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-He'll know you took it. -Yes, me. Not you.

950
01:12:23,137 --> 01:12:24,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Understand?

951
01:12:33,447 --> 01:12:34,436
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Robert.

952

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l have fallen in love with him.

953
01:12:40,688 --> 01:12:43,384
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then l know how hard this has been for you.

954
01:12:51,765 --> 01:12:53,858
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Notebook?

955
01:12:55,903 --> 01:12:57,768
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then he's just getting started.

956
01:13:28,235 --> 01:13:29,793
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Good evening. -Professor.

957
01:13:29,970 --> 01:13:32,731
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Professor.

958

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Here. -Could l get your autograph? -l'm walking tonight. -Professor.

959
01:13:36,677 --> 01:13:38,577
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let him come. l don't care.

960
01:13:38,746 --> 01:13:41,146
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Professor. -Professor.

961
01:15:05,899 --> 01:15:08,367
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You all right? -l'm alive.

962
01:15:08,535 --> 01:15:10,628
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Saves me cutting you an air hole.

963
01:15:24,685 --> 01:15:27,176
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-l'm impressed. -Why's that?

964
01:15:27,354 --> 01:15:29,845
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're finally getting your hands dirty.

965
01:15:30,491 --> 01:15:33,187
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}lt's what a good trick costs, Angier.

966
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:34,691
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Risk.

967
01:15:34,862 --> 01:15:36,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sacrifice.

968
01:15:36,630 --> 01:15:40,293
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The sacrifice, l'm afraid, is gonna be yours, unless you give me what l want.

969
01:15:41,602 --> 01:15:43,832
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Which is? -Your secret.

970
01:15:44,371 --> 01:15:46,236
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My secret?

971

01:15:48,842 --> 01:15:51,436
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fallon wouldn't tell me. He doesn't seem to talk at all.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have my notebook.

974
01:15:53,046 --> 01:15:54,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Useless without the keyword.

975

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Write down your method, Mr. Borden.

01:16:18,572 --> 01:16:20,836
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The keyword is the method.

980
01:16:24,645 --> 01:16:25,805
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's my engineer?

981
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:35,554
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Alive? -How fast can you dig?

01:16:38,125 --> 01:16:41,094
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fallon! You hear me? Fallon!

01:16:42,629 --> 01:16:45,063
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-How's the arm? -Still attached.

984
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:48,932
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Did you find your answer? -Our answer.

985
01:16:49,102 --> 01:16:51,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cutter, l haven't looked yet. l wanted you to share this.

986
01:16:52,072 --> 01:16:54,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l already know how he does it, Robert.

01:16:54,708 --> 01:16:57,575
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The same way he always has. The same way as we do.

988
01:16:57,744 --> 01:17:00,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}lt's just that you want something more.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, let's find out then, shall we?

990
01:17:07,387 --> 01:17:08,684
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What does it mean?

991
01:17:16,763 --> 01:17:19,027
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}lt means, Cutter, we have a journey ahead of us.

992
01:17:19,199 --> 01:17:21,929
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-To America. -Robert?

993
01:17:22,102 --> 01:17:24,229
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen to me.

994
01:17:25,172 --> 01:17:28,539
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Obsession is a young man's game.

995
01:17:28,709 --> 01:17:32,645
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Oh, come on. -l can't follow you any further in it.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l'm sorry.

01:17:54,201 --> 01:17:55,566
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Champagne, your finest.

1001
01:17:56,303 --> 01:17:58,703
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l didn't know we were going to be joined for dinner.

1002
01:17:58,872 --> 01:18:01,807
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Absolutely. We are celebrating. -Miss Wenscombe.

1003
01:18:01,975 --> 01:18:04,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Fallon. Well, what are we celebrating?

1004
01:18:05,078 --> 01:18:07,512
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, we've hit upon a new trick, haven't we, Fallon?

1005
01:18:07,681 --> 01:18:10,582
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What trick, Freddy? -Yes, Freddy, what trick?

1006
01:18:10,751 --> 01:18:15,017
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l am going to bury myself alive every night...

1007
01:18:15,188 --> 01:18:18,954
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and then someone will come along and dig me up. Wonderful.

1008
01:18:19,126 --> 01:18:23,028
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-No, l think my husband's had quite enough. -No, pour the champagne. Come on, pour...

1009
01:18:23,196 --> 01:18:25,926
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right. Sarah, don't talk to me like that. l'm not a child.

1010
01:18:26,099 --> 01:18:28,033
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Perhaps it would... -Perhaps, Mr. Fallon...

1011
01:18:28,201 --> 01:18:31,261
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...you might escort Miss Wenscombe home. My husband's being a bore.

1012
01:18:31,438 --> 01:18:33,531
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-l see no reason why you have to suffer. -Oh, please. Don't ruin this evening.

1013
01:18:33,707 --> 01:18:35,004
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do not be so disappointing them

1014
01:18:38,478 --> 01:18:42,039
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good night, Mrs. Borden. Good night, Freddy.

1015
01:18:45,852 --> 01:18:47,979
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-"Freddy"? -Well, that's my name.

1016
01:18:48,155 --> 01:18:52,421
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Not at home. -Well, l'm not always at home, am l?

1017
01:18:53,393 --> 01:18:56,294
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, couldn't you have at least taken off the beard?

1018
01:18:56,463 --> 01:19:00,126
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sarah, l just came from the bloody theater just now.

1019
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:01,995
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right? And l'm out in public.

1020
01:19:02,169 --> 01:19:05,297
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Everybody else loves it. -Why are you being like this, Alfred?

1021
01:19:05,939 --> 01:19:08,237
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l had a terrible ordeal today.

1022
01:19:08,408 --> 01:19:13,038
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l thought that something very precious...

1023
01:19:13,213 --> 01:19:15,113
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...had been lost to me.

1024
01:19:15,282 --> 01:19:18,376
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So l just wanted to celebrate. Just a little.

1025
01:19:19,186 --> 01:19:20,813
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, what?

1026
01:19:20,988 --> 01:19:22,717
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did you lose?

1027
01:19:27,294 --> 01:19:28,659
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l see, more secrets.

1028
01:19:29,630 --> 01:19:32,724
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sarah, secrets are my life.

1029
01:19:34,768 --> 01:19:36,793
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Our life. -No, Alfred, stop.

1030
01:19:36,970 --> 01:19:40,497
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This isn't you. Stop performing.

1031
01:20:04,731 --> 01:20:07,256
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l thought l had the place to myself, Mr. Brent.

1032
01:20:07,434 --> 01:20:08,799
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Unexpected guests.

1033
01:20:08,969 --> 01:20:12,405
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not very polite. A lot of questions.

1034
01:20:12,572 --> 01:20:15,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}First l thought they might work for the government.

1035
01:20:15,375 --> 01:20:17,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-No? -Worse.

1036
01:20:17,411 --> 01:20:19,606
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They work for Thomas Edison.

1037
01:20:20,981 --> 01:20:23,381
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Today, a most curious deveIopment.

1038
01:20:23,550 --> 01:20:27,577
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His assistant came to us with a proposition.

1039
01:20:28,388 --> 01:20:31,653
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}ObviousIy, Angier has sent her and toId her to admit as much.

1040
01:20:31,825 --> 01:20:34,555
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Does he enjoy taking his bows under the stage?

1041
01:20:34,728 --> 01:20:38,391
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He sent me here to steal your secrets, but l've actually come to offer you his.

1042
01:20:38,899 --> 01:20:42,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the truth, is it?

1043
01:20:50,610 --> 01:20:53,909
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, that's what he told me to tell you. The truth...

1044
01:20:54,081 --> 01:20:57,881
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...is that l loved him, and l stood by him, and he sent me to you...

1045
01:20:58,051 --> 01:21:01,418
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...like he would send a stagehand to pick up his shirts.

1046
01:21:01,588 --> 01:21:04,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l hate him for that.

1047
01:21:04,591 --> 01:21:08,425
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l can spot Angier's methods from the back of the theater.

1048
01:21:09,596 --> 01:21:11,621
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, what could you possibly have to offer me?

1049
01:21:12,132 --> 01:21:14,896
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know how he does his tricks, but you can't understand...

1050
01:21:15,068 --> 01:21:17,536
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...why no one can see yours are better. You hide this.

1051
01:21:17,704 --> 01:21:21,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l had to look very closely to spot it when you were performing The Transported Man...

1052
01:21:21,808 --> 01:21:24,436
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but this makes you unique.

1053
01:21:24,611 --> 01:21:26,772
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}lt shows the audience you aren't using a double.

1054
01:21:26,947 --> 01:21:29,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You mustn't hide it, display it proudly.

1055
01:21:29,216 --> 01:21:33,482
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l'm sure it takes great skill to perform illusions with one good hand.

1056
01:21:33,954 --> 01:21:35,979
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, it does.

1057
01:21:37,524 --> 01:21:40,084
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So let people know.

1058
01:21:40,927 --> 01:21:44,488
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You could be so much more than he is, and l can show you how.

1059
01:21:46,032 --> 01:21:47,795
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think she's teIIing the truth.

1060
01:21:48,668 --> 01:21:50,795
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think we cannot trust her.

1061
01:21:54,508 --> 01:21:56,806
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I Iove her. I need her.

1062
01:21:58,111 --> 01:22:01,171
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To open myseIf to such a reIationship...

1063
01:22:01,348 --> 01:22:05,216
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...to the dangers of such an affair...

1064
01:22:05,719 --> 01:22:10,088
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...I need assurances of fideIity. Of Iove.

1065
01:22:11,191 --> 01:22:12,681
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But how to be sure?

1066
01:22:15,095 --> 01:22:19,327
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know a way. It's the onIy way to know her mind.

1067
01:22:19,499 --> 01:22:21,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How could he send you away?

1068
01:22:23,036 --> 01:22:24,901
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She must heIp me rid ourseIves of Angier.

1069
01:22:32,846 --> 01:22:35,644
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Today, my mistress proves her truthfuIness.

1070
01:22:35,816 --> 01:22:38,114
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not to me, you understand.

1071
01:22:38,285 --> 01:22:40,253
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've been convinced since she Ied me to Root.

1072
01:22:40,420 --> 01:22:46,222
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Today, OIivia proves her Iove for me to you, Angier.

1073
01:22:46,393 --> 01:22:48,293
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, Angier.

1074
01:22:48,461 --> 01:22:50,759
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She gave you this notebook at my request.

1075
01:22:50,931 --> 01:22:56,096
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, yes, "TesIa " is mereIy the key to my diary, not to my trick.

1076
01:22:56,269 --> 01:23:00,797
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you reaIIy think I'd part with my secret so easiIy after so much?

1077
01:23:00,974 --> 01:23:02,202
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Goodbye, Angier.

1078
01:23:02,375 --> 01:23:06,471
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}May you find soIace for your thwarted ambition back in your American home.

1079
01:23:16,690 --> 01:23:17,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tesla!

1080
01:23:19,559 --> 01:23:22,357
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tesla! Alley! Alley!

1081
01:23:24,331 --> 01:23:26,731
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tesla never made a machine like the one l asked for.

1082
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:29,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-We never said he had. -But you let me believe that he had.

1083
01:23:29,803 --> 01:23:32,431
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You stole my money because your funding had been cut off.

1084
01:23:32,606 --> 01:23:36,372
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've been shooting sparks at my top hat, laughing at me all along...

1085
01:23:36,543 --> 01:23:39,011
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...while using my money to stave off ruin.

1086
01:23:40,180 --> 01:23:41,977
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Now, l have seen Edison's men. -Where?

1087
01:23:42,148 --> 01:23:45,117
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}ln the hotel. And l have every mind to bring them up here myself.

1088
01:23:45,285 --> 01:23:47,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That would be unwise, Mr. Angier.

1089
01:23:47,487 --> 01:23:50,513
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}lt is true that you are our last remaining financier...

1090
01:23:50,690 --> 01:23:52,453
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but we have not stolen your money.

1091
01:23:52,626 --> 01:23:53,991
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sir, my cat.

1092
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:57,129
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When l told you l could make your machine, l spoke a simple truth.

1093
01:23:57,297 --> 01:24:00,698
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Then why isn't the machine working? -Because exact science, Mr. Angier...

1094
01:24:00,867 --> 01:24:02,164
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...is not an exact science.

1095
01:24:02,335 --> 01:24:05,429
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The machine simply does not operate as expected.

1096
01:24:05,605 --> 01:24:07,869
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}lt requires further examination.

01:24:08,041 --> 01:24:10,635
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-So where did my top hat go? -Nowhere.

1098
01:24:10,810 --> 01:24:13,574
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We tried the damn thing a dozen times.

1099
01:24:13,747 --> 01:24:15,078
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The hat went nowhere.

1100
01:24:15,248 --> 01:24:17,182
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We need to try different material.

1101
01:24:17,350 --> 01:24:21,013
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}lt may provoke a different result.

1102
01:24:21,955 --> 01:24:23,616
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Copernicus, come on.

1103
01:24:30,797 --> 01:24:35,291
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are responsible for whatever happens to this animal, doctor.

1104
01:24:56,389 --> 01:25:00,052
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l hope that whatever you were really doing with my money was more worthwhile...

1105
01:25:00,226 --> 01:25:02,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...Mr. Tesla.

1106
01:25:57,283 --> 01:25:58,272
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alley!

1107
01:26:01,688 --> 01:26:02,916
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So the machine was working.

1108
01:26:03,089 --> 01:26:06,616
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l never bothered to check the calibration because the hat never moved.

1109
01:26:06,793 --> 01:26:09,853
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These things never quite work as you expect them to, Mr. Angier.

1110
01:26:10,030 --> 01:26:12,191
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's one of the principal beauties of science.

1111
01:26:12,365 --> 01:26:15,732
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l'll need a couple of weeks to iron out the problems with the machine.

1112
01:26:15,902 --> 01:26:18,097
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll send word when it's ready.

1113
01:26:20,306 --> 01:26:22,399
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't forget your hat.

1114
01:26:23,376 --> 01:26:27,005
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Well, which one is mine? -They're all your hats, Mr. Angier.

1115
01:26:33,019 --> 01:26:35,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You look so pretty in this new dress of yours.

1116
01:26:36,089 --> 01:26:39,957
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Are we going to the zoo this afternoon? -No, no, no. Daddy has some errands to run.

1117
01:26:40,126 --> 01:26:42,117
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-But you promised. -l promised, did l?

1118
01:26:42,295 --> 01:26:44,456
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then go to the zoo we shall.

1119
01:26:44,631 --> 01:26:47,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So Daddy will go run his errands and l'll be back before you know it...

1120
01:26:48,101 --> 01:26:51,798
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...so you go get ready. We'll go see those chimpanzees.

1121
01:26:55,075 --> 01:26:57,236
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sarah.

1122
01:26:57,410 --> 01:26:58,434
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing?

1123
01:27:02,115 --> 01:27:05,107
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We each of us have our vices.

1124
01:27:08,154 --> 01:27:11,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sarah, whatever you may think...

1125
01:27:12,092 --> 01:27:15,687
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...your only competition for my affections is our little girl.

1126

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l love you. l will always love you and you alone.

1127
01:27:22,235 --> 01:27:25,432
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You mean it today. -Absolutely.

1128
01:27:26,272 --> 01:27:29,571
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Which makes it so much harder when you don't.

1129
01:27:39,252 --> 01:27:41,982
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}ls that more shopping? She does love the smell of money.

1130
01:27:42,155 --> 01:27:45,591
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The little lady wants to go to the zoo, so l thought you could take her.

1131
01:27:45,758 --> 01:27:48,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah? l mean, l can do it tomorrow if not.

1132
01:27:48,928 --> 01:27:54,389
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And Sarah, she knows.

1133
01:27:54,567 --> 01:27:58,435
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She... l mean, at least she knows that something's not right...

1134
01:27:58,605 --> 01:28:02,063
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...so if you can just do whatever you can to help me with her.

1135
01:28:02,242 --> 01:28:06,178
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Talk to her. Just convince her that l do love her.

1136
01:28:17,157 --> 01:28:21,184
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What is it, Freddy? -Just don't call me that, please.

1137
01:28:21,361 --> 01:28:23,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}lt's nothing. lt's just, you know, there's sometimes....

1139
01:28:26,466 --> 01:28:28,263
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...when you're with me, you're with me.

1140
01:28:28,434 --> 01:28:30,561
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Leave your family at home where they belong.

1141
01:28:30,970 --> 01:28:32,437
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l'm trying.

1142
01:28:32,605 --> 01:28:34,095
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l'm trying, Olivia.

1143

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-l'll get dressed. -Yeah.

1144
01:28:38,077 --> 01:28:41,171
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l saw Fallon hanging around again.

1145
01:28:41,481 --> 01:28:43,608
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's something about that man l don't trust.

1146
01:28:43,950 --> 01:28:46,748
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You trust me? Then trust Fallon.

1147
01:28:47,253 --> 01:28:49,483
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He protects the things that l care about.

1148
01:29:27,827 --> 01:29:30,125
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're sorry to see you go, Mr. Angier.

1149
01:29:30,296 --> 01:29:32,856
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We were sorry to see Mr. Tesla leave as well.

1150
01:29:33,032 --> 01:29:35,023
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was very good to Colorado Springs.

1151
01:29:35,535 --> 01:29:41,474
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Angier, l didn't think it was necessary to tell Edison's men about the box.

1152
01:29:42,175 --> 01:29:43,164
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What box?

1153
01:30:08,635 --> 01:30:11,968
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I apoIogize for Ieaving without saying goodbye...

01:30:12,438 --> 01:30:16,602
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but I seem to have outstayed my weIcome in CoIorado.

1155
01:30:17,377 --> 01:30:21,814
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The truIy extraordinary is not permitted in science and industry.

1156
01:30:21,981 --> 01:30:25,291
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perhaps you'II find more Iuck in your fieId,

1157
01:30:25,292 --> 01:30:27,419
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}where peopIe are happy to be mystified.

01:30:27,587 --> 01:30:31,489
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wiII find what you are Iooking for in this box.

01:30:31,924 --> 01:30:35,951
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}AIIey has written you a thorough set of instructions.

01:30:36,129 --> 01:30:40,759
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I add onIy one suggestion on using the machine:

1161
01:30:40,933 --> 01:30:42,867
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Destroy it.

1162
01:30:43,036 --> 01:30:46,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Drop it to the bottom of the deepest ocean.

1163
01:30:46,306 --> 01:30:49,503
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Such a thing wiII bring you onIy misery.

1164
01:30:53,579 --> 01:30:57,106
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}TesIa's warning is as unheeded as he knew it wouId be.

1165
01:30:57,283 --> 01:30:59,217
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Today, I tested the machine...

1166
01:30:59,385 --> 01:31:03,845
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...taking precautions in case TesIa hadn't ironed out the kinks in its operation.

1167
01:31:04,023 --> 01:31:08,858
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, if it went wrong, I wouId not wanna Iive Iike that for Iong.

1168
01:31:27,513 --> 01:31:31,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But here at the Turn, I must Ieave you, Borden.

1169
01:31:31,718 --> 01:31:33,879
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, you, Borden.

1170
01:31:34,053 --> 01:31:36,283
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sitting there in your ceII...

1171
01:31:36,456 --> 01:31:40,483
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...reading my diary, awaiting your death...

1172
01:31:40,660 --> 01:31:42,719
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...for my murder.

1173
01:31:47,900 --> 01:31:51,131
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Angier's journal, that gesture of good faith, that's a fake.

1174

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l assure you, it's not. The provenance of the journal is clear and under no doubt.

1175
01:31:55,441 --> 01:32:00,003
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And it's written in Angier's own hand, of which we had numerous examples.

1176
01:32:01,948 --> 01:32:03,745
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}lt don't matter.

1177
01:32:05,818 --> 01:32:08,719
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So my tricks.

1178
01:32:11,090 --> 01:32:14,753
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-All of them. -lncluding The Transported Man?

1179
01:32:15,595 --> 01:32:17,893
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, Lord Caldlow will be very pleased indeed.

1180
01:32:18,064 --> 01:32:21,556
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, he won't. Because they're not complete.

1181
01:32:21,734 --> 01:32:24,328
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}lt's just the Pledge and the Turn for each.

1182
01:32:24,504 --> 01:32:27,098
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Without the Prestige for these tricks...

1183
01:32:27,707 --> 01:32:30,039
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-...these are worthless. -Yeah.

1184
01:32:30,710 --> 01:32:34,168
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You get the rest of it when you bring my daughter here.

1185
01:32:37,049 --> 01:32:39,108
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l wanna say goodbye.

1186
01:32:40,987 --> 01:32:42,716
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have to go through it now.

01:32:45,224 --> 01:32:46,486
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Deny it all you want.

1189
01:32:46,659 --> 01:32:48,957
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Olivia means nothing.

1190

01:36:48,200 --> 01:36:50,430

01:37:36,849 --> 01:37:39,682
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not a trick. Well, he has to come back.

01:38:02,308 --> 01:38:04,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you'll have to dress it up a little.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You haven't spoken about her, Freddy. Not once.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That she had something to tell me about you.

01:39:04,270 --> 01:39:07,603
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The part that found you. The part that's sitting here right now.

01:39:16,348 --> 01:39:20,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You could be in some other restaurant with some other woman right now...

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...talking about me that way.

01:39:37,837 --> 01:39:41,637
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's back. After two years.

1278
01:39:41,807 --> 01:39:45,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's got a new trick. They're saying it's the best London's ever seen.

1279
01:39:47,813 --> 01:39:51,214
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should see the look on your face, Professor.

1280
01:39:52,184 --> 01:39:54,049
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should go to him.

1281
01:39:54,220 --> 01:39:56,586
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You two deserve each other.

1282

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l'm afraid l'm booked. The Moscow Ballet, they'll be playing through next year.

01:40:05,664 --> 01:40:08,258
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then get rid of them. There'll be a hundred performances.

1284
01:40:08,434 --> 01:40:10,129
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No more, no less.

01:40:10,302 --> 01:40:12,736
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Five performances a week. No matinees.

1286
01:40:14,640 --> 01:40:17,575
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that's what you'll be charging for each ticket. Good day.

1287
01:40:40,366 --> 01:40:42,857
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ladies and gentlemen, my first trick of the evening...

01:40:46,238 --> 01:40:48,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anyone in the audience who would be irrevocably damaged...

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...by seeing a man drown should leave now.

1296
01:41:19,238 --> 01:41:22,071
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and it is a strange future indeed.

1297
01:41:22,775 --> 01:41:24,834
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The world, ladies and gentlemen...

1298

1299
01:41:49,601 --> 01:41:54,038
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What you're about to witness is not magic.

1300
01:41:54,206 --> 01:41:55,673
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}lt is purely science.

1301

01:41:58,644 --> 01:42:01,545
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...so that you can examine the machine for yourselves.

1303
01:42:57,036 --> 01:43:00,199
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Man's reach exceeds his imagination.

1304
01:43:00,372 --> 01:43:01,566
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bravo!

1307
01:43:22,394 --> 01:43:24,055
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One hundred performances.

1308
01:43:24,229 --> 01:43:26,527
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why? Does his method dictate that?

1309
01:43:26,698 --> 01:43:28,598
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}ls it a publicity move? What is it?

1310
01:43:28,767 --> 01:43:30,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's a no-talent magician,

1311
01:43:30,921 --> 01:43:33,466
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and they're calling him......the bloody best in England. Why?

1312
01:43:33,639 --> 01:43:36,301
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fifty yards in a second. ln a second!

1313
01:43:36,475 --> 01:43:39,444
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And all that we know is he uses a trap door.

1314
01:43:39,611 --> 01:43:43,809
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Brilliant. What is going on under that stage?

1315
01:43:43,982 --> 01:43:46,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why can't you outthink him?

1316
01:44:01,500 --> 01:44:03,024
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They do this every night?

1317
01:44:03,202 --> 01:44:06,365
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After each performance, yeah?

1318
01:44:36,768 --> 01:44:38,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're done.

1319
01:44:39,538 --> 01:44:40,971
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right?

1320
01:44:42,407 --> 01:44:44,034
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let him have his trick.

1321

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l don't need... l don't need his secret.

1322
01:44:46,812 --> 01:44:48,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So...

1323
01:44:49,748 --> 01:44:52,615
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...don't go back there, you leave him alone.

1324
01:44:52,818 --> 01:44:55,981
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Both of us, just leave him alone.

1325
01:44:56,155 --> 01:44:57,622
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're done.

1326

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l told you, John...

1327
01:45:08,700 --> 01:45:10,634
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...l don't want you backstage on this one.

1328
01:45:12,504 --> 01:45:14,904
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l would like to invite you to come up on-stage now...

1329

1330
01:45:46,605 --> 01:45:50,632
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Hey, you, where do you think you're going? -l'm part of the bloody act, you fool.

1331
01:45:59,685 --> 01:46:01,448
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who was that?

1332
01:46:58,010 --> 01:46:59,034
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey!

1333
01:46:59,211 --> 01:47:02,703
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's the bloody key? Where's the bloody key?

1334
01:47:02,914 --> 01:47:05,144
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The blind man's got it!

1335
01:47:05,317 --> 01:47:08,878
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's the bloody key? Bloody drowning!

1336
01:47:18,263 --> 01:47:20,197
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold on!

1337
01:47:24,636 --> 01:47:25,898
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What have you done?

1338
01:47:47,826 --> 01:47:53,162
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alfred Borden, you have been found guilty of the murder of Robert Angier.

1339
01:47:53,332 --> 01:47:56,961
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You will be hanged by the neck until dead.

1340
01:47:57,769 --> 01:48:00,761
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}May the Lord have mercy on your soul.

1341
01:48:02,374 --> 01:48:04,171
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Cutter?

1342
01:48:04,910 --> 01:48:06,207
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Owens.

1343
01:48:06,912 --> 01:48:09,073
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, thank you for coming, Mr. Owens.

1344
01:48:09,247 --> 01:48:13,547
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}lt has fallen to me to dispose of Mr. Angier's equipment.

1345
01:48:13,719 --> 01:48:15,311
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But l noticed from this manifest...

1346
01:48:15,487 --> 01:48:18,945
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...that Lord Caldlow has purchased the bulk of the items.

1347
01:48:19,124 --> 01:48:23,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Cutter, if you needed to know where to deliver these items, surely you...

1348
01:48:23,228 --> 01:48:26,527
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no. lt's just there is one particular item...

1349
01:48:26,698 --> 01:48:30,725
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...this item, in fact, that l would like to...

1350
01:48:30,902 --> 01:48:32,893
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You would like to...? -Buy.

1351
01:48:33,071 --> 01:48:35,005
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Buy yourself? -Yeah, l suppose so.

1352
01:48:36,241 --> 01:48:38,175
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-This is the machine? -Yes.

1353
01:48:38,343 --> 01:48:42,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, l'm afraid Lord Caldlow was adamant about purchasing this particular item.

1354
01:48:43,248 --> 01:48:45,944
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you think l could talk to Lord Caldlow in person?

1355
01:48:46,385 --> 01:48:48,785
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Out of the question, l'm afraid.

1356
01:48:51,323 --> 01:48:53,086
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course...

1357
01:48:53,258 --> 01:48:56,159
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...l suppose if, in the course of your delivery arrangements...

1358
01:48:56,328 --> 01:48:58,762
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...your paths were to cross...

1359
01:48:59,197 --> 01:49:03,099
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-...l can't stop you speaking your mind. -Thank you.

01:49:04,603 --> 01:49:06,798
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Still here, Borden? -For now.

1361

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Got a visitor.

1362
01:49:08,673 --> 01:49:09,662
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lord Caldlow.

1363

1370
01:49:35,867 --> 01:49:39,394
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, but everything is gonna be all right.

1371
01:49:39,838 --> 01:49:42,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You must be Lord Caldlow. -Caldlow.

1372

1375
01:49:52,684 --> 01:49:55,653
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't they know you can't escape without your little rubber ball?

1376
01:49:55,821 --> 01:49:56,947
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l pulled you out.

1377
01:49:57,122 --> 01:49:58,646
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Out of that tank.

01:49:58,824 --> 01:50:02,487
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All l wanted to do was prove that l was a better magician...

1379
01:50:02,661 --> 01:50:04,526
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but you couldn't leave me alone.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but you're not afraid to get your hands dirty anymore, are you?

1382
01:50:13,939 --> 01:50:15,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, not anymore.

01:50:17,342 --> 01:50:20,539
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because no one cares about the man in the box, the man who disappears.

1385
01:50:20,712 --> 01:50:21,701
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You win?

01:50:23,248 --> 01:50:27,651
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This ain't a bloody competition anymore, Angier, this is my little girl's life.

01:50:27,819 --> 01:50:30,879
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And don't you dare put her in the middle of this.

1388
01:50:31,056 --> 01:50:33,889
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, l know how hard it is to have someone so special...

1389

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...taken away from me, don't l, Borden?

1390
01:50:37,529 --> 01:50:40,157
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you can't take her with you now, can you?

1391
01:50:40,332 --> 01:50:42,095
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, she'll be looked after.

1392
01:50:42,634 --> 01:50:46,764
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Goodbye, Professor. Come on, darling. -No, no, no. Stop, stop, stop. Look.

02:03:50,154 --> 02:03:53,089
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and makes it into something extraordinary.

1527
