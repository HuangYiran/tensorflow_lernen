很荣幸能为你们举办订婚宴

3

一切都不同了

4
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:09,209
你要结婚了  这才是问题所在
You are to be married, and that is that.

5
00:00:09,244 --> 00:00:10,677
她就是Ilona
She is Ilona.

6
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:11,593
不许你再提起Mina Murray
You must never again

7
00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:13,580
和我妻子长得像这事儿
mention Mina Murray's resemblance to my wife.

8
00:00:13,614 --> 00:00:15,187
我需要你的血去创造血清
I need your blood to create a serum 

9
00:00:15,188 --> 00:00:17,751
这样你才能去征服阳光
so you are able to conquer daylight.

10
00:00:17,785 --> 00:00:19,069
我想你去查出
I want you to find out 

11
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:20,353
关于Shaw将军的一切
everything about this General Shaw.

12
00:00:20,388 --> 00:00:22,856
他是一个强大的对手
He's a powerful ally of my competitors.

13
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:23,523
你想知道的
Vera Markham can tell you 

14
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:24,664
关于Shaw将军 
all you need to know 

15
00:00:24,665 --> 00:00:26,693
Vera Markham会告诉你
about Shaw.

16
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:27,693
你是？
Yes?

17
00:00:27,727 --> 00:00:30,096
你想雇佣我
You wish to employ my services

18
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:33,565
让Renfield先生来解答一个问题
in order to get Mr. Renfield to answer one question.

19
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,667
啊！
Unh!

20
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,895
Grayson先生  你在这儿干嘛？
Mr. Grayson. What are you doing here?

21
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,797
我知道我不应该在这儿
I know I shouldn't be here,

22
00:01:05,831 --> 00:01:07,198
但没时间了
but there's no time.

23
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,968
没时间干嘛？
Time for what?

24
00:01:10,002 --> 00:01:12,270
不  你必须离开  立刻  要不…
No. You must leave, immediately, or...

25
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:13,704
我会走的
I'll go.

26
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:16,074
我保证
I promise.

27
00:01:16,108 --> 00:01:18,547
但我必须告诉你  
But I must tell you, 

28
00:01:18,548 --> 00:01:20,445
你在犯一个错误
you're making a mistake.

29
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,480
严重的错误
A terrible mistake.

30
00:01:22,514 --> 00:01:24,882
- 你什么意思？  - Harker
- What do you mean? - Harker.

31
00:01:24,917 --> 00:01:28,118
你知道的  他绝不会带给你快乐
He'll never be able to make you happy, and you know it.

32
00:01:28,153 --> 00:01:30,087
你怎样这样说
How dare you.

33
00:01:30,121 --> 00:01:32,924
没时间自欺欺人了  Mina
Now is not the time for lies, Mina.

34
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:34,891
你知道这是真的
You know it's the truth.

35
00:01:34,926 --> 00:01:36,726
如果不是  就说出来
If it isn't, say it.

36
00:01:36,761 --> 00:01:38,929
看着我的眼睛  告诉我
Look me in the eyes and say it,

37
00:01:38,964 --> 00:01:40,730
- 那我就走  - 不 不 不
- and I'll go. - No, no, no.

38
00:01:40,765 --> 00:01:44,901
我…我爱…我爱Jonathan  不是别人
I-I love... I love Jonathan, and no other,

39
00:01:44,936 --> 00:01:46,937
他会成为我的丈夫
and he will be my husband.

40
00:02:26,483 --> 00:02:29,002
整天都赖在床上
Of all the days to lie-in.

41
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:33,373
你不知道今晚前
Don't you know we have a million things 

42
00:02:33,374 --> 00:02:35,310
我们还有一箩筐事情要做吗？
to do before tonight?

43
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:39,296
- 它仍继续？  - 当然仍在继续
- It's still on? - Of course it's still on!

44
00:02:39,876 --> 00:02:42,141
除非你重新考虑  
Unless you've reconsidered. 

45
00:02:42,142 --> 00:02:44,407
不不不  当然不是
No. No. No, of course not.

46
00:02:46,604 --> 00:02:48,316
那么  看在上帝的面子上  
Well then, for goodness' sake, 

47
00:02:48,317 --> 00:02:49,295
起来吧  亲爱的
get up, darling.

48
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,188
这么重要的日子  
You mustn't waste another second 

49
00:02:51,189 --> 00:02:52,627
别浪费一分一秒啊
of this momentous day.

50
00:02:52,643 --> 00:02:55,300
你的婚宴在伦敦可是前无古人
Yours is going to be the most spectacular

51
00:02:55,344 --> 00:02:56,879
盛世非凡呢
engagement party London has ever seen.

52
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,222
小心点儿  这很脆弱
Be careful. That's very fragile.

53
00:03:07,257 --> 00:03:09,685
来看看你的第一测试项目
Come and meet your first test subject.

54
00:03:10,393 --> 00:03:12,894
拜托用线把它和门连上
Place it in line with the door, please.

55
00:03:14,497 --> 00:03:17,667
没有什么东西不能有阴影！
And no obstruction that may cast a shadow!

56
00:03:27,243 --> 00:03:29,111
我不会靠得太近的  教授
I wouldn't get too close, Professor.

57
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,947
就算你不认同
I think you'll find her suitable,

58
00:03:31,981 --> 00:03:33,949
我觉得她挺合适
if not exactly agreeable.

59
00:03:38,921 --> 00:03:41,222
这儿还有很多技术挑战
There are many technical challenges,

60
00:03:41,256 --> 00:03:43,625
但我相信在给定时间内  我们会战胜它的
but I believe we will surmount them, given time.

61
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:46,327
时间是奢侈的  我们没时间
Time is a luxury we do not have.

62
00:03:48,965 --> 00:03:50,765
我必须马上在阳光下行走
I must walk in sunlight soon.

63
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,901
人们起疑了
People are getting suspicious.

64
00:03:52,935 --> 00:03:56,770
你不明白吗？
Do you understand?

65
00:03:56,805 --> 00:03:58,739
对了  Renfield去哪了？
By the way, where's Renfield?

66
00:03:58,773 --> 00:04:00,408
他本应该在实验室
He was meant to accompany the lab equipment.

67
00:04:00,442 --> 00:04:02,876
到处都找不到Renfield
Renfield was nowhere to be found.

68
00:04:02,911 --> 00:04:04,912
所以我才自己动手
I had to do it myself.

69
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:18,759
Renfield先生
Mr. Renfield.

70
00:04:18,793 --> 00:04:22,930
来一个小旅程吧  就你和我
We are about to embark on a journey, you and I.

71
00:04:22,964 --> 00:04:24,765
以一个问题为开端
It begins with a single question,

72
00:04:24,799 --> 00:04:28,101
以你的回答为终点
and it ends with your answer to that question.

73
00:04:34,742 --> 00:04:37,431
为了让你记住这点
I want you to remember that, 

74
00:04:37,432 --> 00:04:39,112
我再说一遍
so I will say it again.

75
00:04:39,147 --> 00:04:42,649
以你的回答  为终点
It ends with your answer.

76
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:45,570
所以你懂的  无论你觉得
So you see, no matter how helpless 

77
00:04:45,571 --> 00:04:48,217
多么无助  多么漫长  
you may feel, no matter how lengthy, 

78
00:04:48,218 --> 00:04:50,623
多么低贱  多么不悦
debasing, and disagreeable

79
00:04:50,658 --> 00:04:53,126
这个“旅程”
the journey may prove,

80
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,862
最终  都是由你掌控
ultimately, you are in control.

81
00:04:57,931 --> 00:05:00,866
能开始了吗？
Let's get started, shall we?

82
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:09,675
在我的专业内  我深感自豪
Though I take great pride in my profession,

83
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,810
虽然后来变得…
it has become...

84
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:15,947
繁琐复杂
tedious of late.

85
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,586
可是  毕竟
There are, after all,

86
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,144
唯一不变的就是
only so many variations 

87
00:05:23,145 --> 00:05:25,323
我可以变着花样的玩儿
on a theme one can play.

88
00:05:25,357 --> 00:05:28,226
放了我
Release me.

89
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,863
啊！
Unh!

90
00:05:32,898 --> 00:05:37,235
当然  每一种用具都是独一无二的
Each client is unique, of course.

91
00:05:37,269 --> 00:05:39,170
方法各有迥异
The methods vary,

92
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:42,540
但是结果必然相同
but the result is inevitably the same.

93
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:45,310
我警告你
I'm warning you,

94
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:47,378
后果很严重
there will be repercussions.

95
00:05:50,182 --> 00:05:51,411
我常常想  
I often think, 

96
00:05:51,412 --> 00:05:54,484
“也许这一次  Janina”
"Perhaps this time, Janina.

97
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:56,386
“就一次  仅此一次
"This time, for once,

98
00:05:56,421 --> 00:05:58,243
“简单的回答了
"The client will dispense with 

99
00:05:58,244 --> 00:05:59,256
我的第一问
all the bluster and defiance

100
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:01,322
所有的咆哮和反抗
and simply answer the question 

101
00:06:01,323 --> 00:06:02,593
都将被免除”
the first time I ask it."

102
00:06:13,304 --> 00:06:16,573
Alexander Grayson爱着谁？
Who does Alexander Grayson love?

103
00:06:19,944 --> 00:06:23,113
哦  好吧
Oh, well.

104
00:06:23,147 --> 00:06:25,115
也许得下次
Perhaps next time.

114
00:06:56,788 --> 00:06:59,699
这是Shaw将军的个人账户
These are General Shaw's personal accounts.

115
00:06:59,722 --> 00:07:01,956
都在这儿了  所属Bellamy公司
It's all there, under Bellamy Limited.

116
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,057
Bellamy公司？
Bellamy?

117
00:07:03,091 --> 00:07:06,394
帝国军火  唯一股东
Sole shareholder, empire munitions.

118
00:07:06,428 --> 00:07:08,196
帝国军火？
Empire munitions?

119
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:11,665
Show从军火制造商那里收钱？
Shaw's receiving money from an arms manufacturer?

120
00:07:16,604 --> 00:07:18,973
七月份  六万磅
60,000 pounds in July.

121
00:07:19,007 --> 00:07:21,776
七月  就在那时…帝国中标了
July, that's when... That's when the empire 

122
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,377
八个新战舰
won the tender for eight new warships.

123
00:07:23,411 --> 00:07:25,680
他拿了佣金
He got commission.

124
00:07:25,714 --> 00:07:27,815
Shaw将军这是受贿罪
General Shaw is taking bribes.

125
00:07:27,849 --> 00:07:29,483
Harker  请问
Harker, please.

126
00:07:29,517 --> 00:07:33,320
你打算如何处置这些信息？
What do you plan to do with this information?

127
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:48,668
我知道你拜托我操办这个派对
I know you begged me to organize this party

128
00:07:48,703 --> 00:07:50,136
我也确实答应你了 但并不意味着
and I agreed, but that doesn't give you

129
00:07:50,171 --> 00:07:52,739
你就可以当甩手姑奶奶了
the right to be an idle princess.

130
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:55,108
你有宾客名单 我有回执
You have the guest list. I have the replies.

131
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:56,876
你负责把这两个对照一下
You check the former against the latter,

132
00:07:56,911 --> 00:07:59,512
因为饭店明天中午前就要最终名单了
and the kitchen needs the final count by noon.

133
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:02,648
宾客名单绝对出错了
This list, it's all wrong.

134
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:05,585
Davenport 爵士 Rothcoft爵士？
Lord Davenport. Lord Rothcroft?

135
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:06,819
是难以想到
Who'd ever have guessed

136
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:08,287
Jonathan还有这样大牌的朋友呢？
that Jonathan had such distinguished friends?

137
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:09,522
是啊 可他们并不是他的朋友
Yes, but they're not his friends.

138
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:11,457
至少 他从来没向我提及过他们
At least, he's never mentioned them.

139
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,359
恐怕这都是我的错
All my doing, I'm afraid.

140
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:15,027
是我坚持让他邀请那些巨头的
I insisted he invite them.

141
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:18,964
Grasyson 先生的盛情小女子有些承受不起
It's all rather overwhelming, Mr. Grayson.

142
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,866
您不觉得您过于大包大揽了吗？
Are you sure it's not too much of an imposition?

143
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,467
绝非如此
Not at all.

144
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:25,170
都是Westenra小姐“法力无边”才让这
This is just an empty stage upon which Miss Westenra

145
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:27,505
才让这平凡的舞台变得妙不可言
has lavished her formidable magic.

146
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,274
总算有人欣赏我的苦劳了
At least somebody appreciates all my hard work.

147
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:33,278
Alexander! 你一定不会相信…
Alexander! You won't believe what...

148
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:36,548
Mina.
Mina.

149
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:38,816
介意和我借一步说话吗？
Could we have a word privately, please?

150
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,386
女士们  请原谅我们的失陪
Ladies, if you will excuse us.

151
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,921
Shaw绝对不是吃素的
Shaw is far from a saint, and I've got

152
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:45,289
我已经找到了证明这个的依据
the evidence to prove it. 

153
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:45,823
现在不要管他
Not now.

154
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:49,327
- 我已经开了个会  - 听我的 别插手
- I've just had a meeting. - I said, leave it.

155
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,423
Lucy 将来你可能会觉得
Lucy, you'll probably think me 

156
00:08:57,424 --> 00:08:59,170
我是个被宠坏的孩子
a spoiled child...

157
00:08:59,204 --> 00:09:01,739
不可能
Impossible.

158
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:04,776
发生什么问题了吗？
What's wrong?

159
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:08,746
我做了个这辈子最令人为难的梦
I had the most perplexing dream.

160
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:11,715
真的？
Really?

161
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,049
那种梦  是吧？
That kind of dream?

162
00:09:13,084 --> 00:09:15,252
不  才不是那种梦呢
No. Not that kind of dream.

163
00:09:15,287 --> 00:09:16,587
告诉我…
Tell me...

164
00:09:16,621 --> 00:09:18,689
梦里的Jonathan是比现在更谨慎呢
Was the dream version of Jonathan more circumspect,

165
00:09:18,723 --> 00:09:21,124
还是有更宽厚的肩膀呢？
or was it merely a matter of circumference?

166
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:22,192
不是
No.

167
00:09:22,226 --> 00:09:24,662
甚至都没…
And it wasn't even...

168
00:09:29,566 --> 00:09:30,733
这个梦无关Jonathan
It wasn't even Jonathan.

169
00:09:30,768 --> 00:09:33,870
当然不是 我自然梦到的是Jonathan
Yes, of course. Of course it was Jonathan.

170
00:09:39,277 --> 00:09:41,444
Renfield  昨晚去Victoria 站点
Renfield went to Victoria Station last night

171
00:09:41,478 --> 00:09:43,746
要取一些实验工具
to pick up some laboratory equipment.

172
00:09:43,781 --> 00:09:45,281
他没来
He never arrived,

173
00:09:45,316 --> 00:09:48,785
从昨晚他就蒸发了
and he has not been heard from since.

174
00:09:48,819 --> 00:09:51,020
他可能只是路上耽搁了
Well, perhaps he was detained.

175
00:09:51,054 --> 00:09:53,456
他都失踪九个小时了
He's been missing nine hours.

176
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:56,392
要是耽搁了他会告诉我们
He would have sent word.

177
00:09:56,427 --> 00:09:57,460
我要去联系警察吗？
Shall I contact the police?

178
00:09:57,494 --> 00:10:00,529
不 不 警方不能介入
No, no. No police.

179
00:10:00,563 --> 00:10:02,865
这次绝对要做的完全不留痕迹
This must be handled with the utmost discretion.

180
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:04,233
在公司的这个节骨眼上
At this point of our business,

181
00:10:04,234 --> 00:10:05,968
Grayson 能源承受不了任何丑闻
Grayson Energy cannot afford a scandal.

182
00:10:06,002 --> 00:10:07,669
我确信您比任何人都了解这一点
I'm sure you understand that more than anyone.

183
00:10:07,704 --> 00:10:10,806
自然如此
Of course.

184
00:10:10,841 --> 00:10:13,209
那好  我从医院太平间开始排查
Well, I'll start with the hospitals, the morgues.

185
00:10:13,243 --> 00:10:14,671
他取设备前
Did he have any appointments prior 

186
00:10:14,672 --> 00:10:15,978
有提前说过要干啥了吗？
to picking up the equipment?

187
00:10:16,012 --> 00:10:18,606
就说去当地钢铁公司
Only to gather some information 

188
00:10:18,607 --> 00:10:20,048
收集些情报
from local steel mills.

189
00:10:20,082 --> 00:10:22,684
好的  这样就略微缩小了范围
Well, that narrows things down a bit.

190
00:10:22,719 --> 00:10:25,687
他可不是不显眼的人
He's hardly inconspicuous.

191
00:10:25,722 --> 00:10:27,823
让我一个人调查吧
Leave it with me.

192
00:10:29,859 --> 00:10:31,226
Jonathan?
Jonathan?

193
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,161
Mina 我现在必须失陪下
I really must be going, Mina.

194
00:10:33,195 --> 00:10:34,562
等等…名单真是对的？
Wa... Is this list right?

195
00:10:34,596 --> 00:10:35,763
抱歉
I'm sorry.

196
00:10:35,797 --> 00:10:36,898
我有些紧急公务不得不去
I-I have some urgent business to attend to.

197
00:10:36,932 --> 00:10:38,266
我们稍后再讨论这个
We'll have to discuss this later.

198
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,644
可是今晚就是订婚夜了啊  
But the party is tonight. 

199
00:10:39,645 --> 00:10:40,368
就剩几个小时了
It's in a few hours.

200
00:10:42,571 --> 00:10:45,073
好吧  我是加了几个人  就这样
Well, I-I made a few additions, is all.

201
00:10:45,107 --> 00:10:46,507
工作上的泛泛之交  以及诸如此类
Business acquaintances and so forth.

202
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,243
我担心的不是加了几个人
It's not the additions that concern me,

203
00:10:48,277 --> 00:10:49,943
而是你漏了的
it's the people you have disinvited.

204
00:10:49,978 --> 00:10:51,044
像是谁？
Like who?

205
00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:53,313
所有你在报社的朋友  比如Szabo
All your friends at the paper. Szabo.

206
00:10:53,348 --> 00:10:54,715
Szabo?
Szabo?

207
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,817
Mina想象下  我们可是提供酒水的
Think, Mina. We're serving alcohol.

208
00:10:56,852 --> 00:10:58,486
你真的希望他来拿香槟杯子玩杂耍
Do you really want him juggling champagne bottles

209
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,787
例行公事的跳小熊舞？
and doing his dancing bear routine?

210
00:10:59,821 --> 00:11:01,154
我确信他一定不会失态
I'm sure he will behave himself.

211
00:11:01,189 --> 00:11:02,256
不行！
The answer is no!

212
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:03,457
我们正在走向整个世界
We're moving up in the world,

213
00:11:03,492 --> 00:11:05,459
在这途中失去几个朋友
and its only natural that we're gonna lose

214
00:11:05,494 --> 00:11:06,960
再自然不过了
a few friends on the way.

215
00:11:06,995 --> 00:11:10,197
这是你内心真实的声音？
Would you listen to yourself?

216
00:11:15,303 --> 00:11:17,537
那么 还有谁要来？
So, who else will be in attendance?

217
00:11:17,571 --> 00:11:20,774
Rothcroft  还有其他几个人
Rothcroft. A few others.

218
00:11:20,808 --> 00:11:22,489
我真切的希望
I do hope there won't be another

219
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:25,011
今晚不要出啥大乱子
 grand spectacle this evening.

220
00:11:25,045 --> 00:11:25,891
最好还是孤立
Brash Americans like Grayson 

221
00:11:25,892 --> 00:11:28,147
像Grayson这种傲气的美国人
are best left twisting in the wind.

222
00:11:28,181 --> 00:11:31,217
一旦他们发现钱不能收买一切
Once they realize their money can't buy cooperation,

223
00:11:31,251 --> 00:11:34,854
除非被惹恼了  他们自己就会打包走人
they pack up and move on... unless provoked.

224
00:11:34,889 --> 00:11:36,589
这是自然  先生
Of course, sir.

225
00:11:36,624 --> 00:11:37,990
不
No.

226
00:11:38,025 --> 00:11:39,992
只要没有您的吩咐
There should never be any direct action against 

227
00:11:40,027 --> 00:11:43,662
就不会直接对他用强
Grayson without your express permission.

228
00:11:51,571 --> 00:11:54,873
我以为你会和Lucy一起呆在Carfax
I thought you'd be at Carfax with Lucy.

229
00:11:54,908 --> 00:11:56,224
我本来是  
I was, 

230
00:11:56,225 --> 00:11:59,077
但是我觉得我最好回家休息下
but I thought I'd come home and rest a while.

231
00:12:05,485 --> 00:12:09,220
你母亲一定会为你骄傲的
Your mother would be so proud of you.

232
00:12:09,255 --> 00:12:12,190
嗯
Hmm.

233
00:12:12,224 --> 00:12:14,892
你把Jonathan发掘成了一个好男人
You've found a fine man in Jonathan.

234
00:12:14,927 --> 00:12:17,595
她一定会对你的选择高兴的
I know she'd be happy with your choice.

235
00:12:17,629 --> 00:12:20,531
可能她会更喜欢一个月前的
A month ago, perhaps,

236
00:12:20,566 --> 00:12:22,800
那个从前的Jonathan
with the old Jonathan.

237
00:12:22,835 --> 00:12:25,536
但他变了
But he's changed.

238
00:12:27,306 --> 00:12:29,740
怎么变的？
In what way?

239
00:12:29,775 --> 00:12:30,975
好吧  就从这开始吧
Well, to start with,

240
00:12:31,009 --> 00:12:33,711
他结交了一帮新朋友…
he's got an entirely new set of friends...

241
00:12:33,745 --> 00:12:35,780
其中多数是商业伙伴…
business associates, most of them...

242
00:12:35,814 --> 00:12:37,721
而且他们是有爵位的富人  
and they're titled and wealthy 

243
00:12:37,722 --> 00:12:38,749
年纪比他大很多
and much older than he is.

244
00:12:38,784 --> 00:12:40,317
这很平常啊
That's perfectly natural.

245
00:12:40,352 --> 00:12:41,538
他转行了  
He's in a new line, 

246
00:12:41,539 --> 00:12:43,120
必然要结交新朋友
he's bound to make new acquaintances.

247
00:12:43,154 --> 00:12:46,423
这倒是  但他和多数老朋友断绝往来
Yes, but he's cut ties with most, if not all,

248
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:48,792
似乎他们的存在可有可无
of his old friends, as though they're expendable.

249
00:12:50,462 --> 00:12:52,896
我不禁想…
And I can't help but think...

250
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:56,833
你也会变得可有可无?
That you might become expendable as well?

251
00:12:56,868 --> 00:13:00,137
我必须承认  Renfield先生…
I must admit, Mr. Renfield...

252
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:03,573
您的耐力令人印象深刻
Your stoicism is impressive,

253
00:13:03,608 --> 00:13:06,676
但绝对算不上惊人
but by no means a surprise.

254
00:13:08,813 --> 00:13:11,347
- Rodrigo?  - 不
- Rodrigo? - No.

255
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,019
不要
Please.

256
00:13:23,027 --> 00:13:25,761
你真坚强…
Oh, you are strong...

257
00:13:25,795 --> 00:13:29,399
看来你很能吃苦
And clearly no stranger to suffering.

258
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:33,302
无论在怎样的环境下
Admirable traits

259
00:13:33,337 --> 00:13:38,106
这都是令人钦佩的特质
under virtually every other circumstance.

260
00:13:40,911 --> 00:13:44,580
噢  Renfield先生
Alas, Mr. Renfield,

261
00:13:44,614 --> 00:13:48,050
别这样  至少此时此地别这样
not here, not now.

262
00:13:48,084 --> 00:13:51,020
这里就你我两人
There is just me and you.

263
00:13:53,156 --> 00:13:57,959
你只需要…回答问题!
The question...and the answer!

264
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:03,698
Alexander Grayson爱谁?
Who does Alexander Grayson love?

265
00:14:26,576 --> 00:14:28,710
Renfield被绑了
Renfield's been abducted.

266
00:14:28,745 --> 00:14:29,845
谁干的?
By whom?

267
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:31,847
我们只能假设是恶龙会
We can only assume it's the Order.

268
00:14:31,881 --> 00:14:33,363
但日落后
But until the sun goes down, 

269
00:14:33,364 --> 00:14:35,216
我才能救他
I'm powerless to help him.

270
00:14:35,251 --> 00:14:37,953
你认为他们会撬开他的嘴?
Do you think they can break him?

271
00:14:37,987 --> 00:14:41,723
他出卖我之前就会死
He will die before he says a word against me.

272
00:14:41,758 --> 00:14:43,926
很好  那问题就解决了
Very well, then. Problem solved.

273
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,333
今天不能让任何事
We cannot let anything 

274
00:14:46,334 --> 00:14:49,597
分散我们对实验的注意力
distract us from today's test.

275
00:14:49,631 --> 00:14:52,533
总共需要多长时间?
How long will this entire process take?

276
00:14:52,568 --> 00:14:55,536
我会用共鸣器
I will use the resonator to generate voltage

277
00:14:55,571 --> 00:14:57,238
给一对电桨生成电压
to a pair of electrical paddles,

278
00:14:57,273 --> 00:15:00,708
然后放入胸腔
then apply them to the subject's chest

279
00:15:00,742 --> 00:15:03,210
尝试让其产生心跳
and attempt to jolt the heart into beating.

280
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:10,217
之后我会给她大剂量注射
Then I will give the subject a massive injection of the serum.

281
00:15:10,251 --> 00:15:11,953
如果成功
If it works,

282
00:15:11,987 --> 00:15:16,591
你尽快将技术运用在我身上
you will immediately repeat the whole process on me.

283
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:19,193
但我没有足够的血清
But I won't have an adequate supply of the serum.

284
00:15:19,227 --> 00:15:21,328
所以过程会比较缓慢
As you can see, it's a slow process.

285
00:15:21,363 --> 00:15:24,198
我没有装备!
I don't have the equipment!

286
00:16:11,878 --> 00:16:14,446
等等
Hold a second.

287
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,481
- 打扰一下  - 怎么了  先生?
- Excuse me. - Yes, sir?

288
00:16:55,888 --> 00:16:57,288
我找Havershim先生
I'm looking for a Mr. Havershim.

289
00:16:57,322 --> 00:16:58,649
如果是生意  
If it's business, 

290
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,357
联系圣路易斯办公室
call my St. Louis office.

291
00:17:00,392 --> 00:17:02,693
我电联过圣路易斯办公室

293
00:17:04,635 --> 00:17:06,330
以及卡森城办公室
and your Carson City office.

294
00:17:06,364 --> 00:17:08,566
先别说  让我猜猜
Don't tell me, let me guess.

295
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,602
你是Alexander Grayson
You're Alexander Grayson.

296
00:17:16,808 --> 00:17:18,408
没错
That's correct.

297
00:17:18,442 --> 00:17:21,845
你想买我的斯威特沃特项目
And you want to buy my Sweetwater operation.

298
00:17:21,879 --> 00:17:24,280
还有双驾横木矿产
And your Doubletree mine.

299
00:17:24,315 --> 00:17:25,388
我出价
I am willing to offer you 

300
00:17:25,389 --> 00:17:28,251
两万美元
20,000 of your American dollars.

301
00:17:28,285 --> 00:17:30,286
当真?
Really?

302
00:17:48,605 --> 00:17:51,540
真令人印象深刻
Impressive.

303
00:17:51,574 --> 00:17:56,245
Grayson先生  你要么是个勇敢的人
Mr. Grayson, you are either a very brave man

304
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:59,448
要么就是个蠢蛋
or a very foolish one.

305
00:17:59,482 --> 00:18:02,752
赤手空拳就敢过来
This is a rough country to be traveling unarmed.

306
00:18:06,856 --> 00:18:08,857
我不喜欢枪
I don't like guns.

307
00:18:11,927 --> 00:18:12,994
这个时候买矿是一个
This is a singularly

308
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:16,031
非常不凑巧的时间  先生
inopportune moment to purchase a mine, sir.

309
00:18:16,065 --> 00:18:17,332
到底怎么回事?
What the hell?

310
00:18:17,367 --> 00:18:20,202
联邦税率正在上调
Federal taxes on minerals are set to escalate,

311
00:18:20,236 --> 00:18:22,971
如果你坚持要买
so if you insist on making the purchase,

312
00:18:23,005 --> 00:18:24,773
提供一个售后回租条款
make sure you tender an option

313
00:18:24,807 --> 00:18:28,043
可以减少损失
with a leaseback provision to avoid the levies.

314
00:18:28,077 --> 00:18:30,145
先生  来点威士忌怎么样?
Whiskey, sir?

315
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:32,180
谢谢
Thank you.

316
00:18:34,216 --> 00:18:35,483
你叫?

00:18:35,517 --> 00:18:39,587
Renfield. R.M. Renfield  先生
Renfield. R.M. Renfield, esquire.

318
00:18:40,855 --> 00:18:43,191
Alexander!
Alexander!

319
00:18:43,225 --> 00:18:44,525
你说的没错
You were right.

320
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,295
Renfield昨天下午四点左右
Renfield was abducted outside of Empire and Colonial

321
00:18:47,329 --> 00:18:49,897
在殖民帝国外被捕了
yesterday afternoon around 4:00.

322
00:18:49,931 --> 00:18:51,302
我问了一个新闻小贩  
I found a newspaper vendor. 

323
00:18:51,303 --> 00:18:52,300
他目睹了整个过程
He witnessed the whole thing.

324
00:18:52,334 --> 00:18:54,434
- 具体描述?  - 三个男人
- Did he give a description? - Mm, three men.

325
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:56,274
一个打他
One hit him, the others

326
00:18:56,275 --> 00:18:59,573
另外两个抓住他扔进了马车
grabbed him and threw him into a carriage.

327
00:18:59,607 --> 00:19:01,335
他通知警方了吗?  
Did he notify the police? 

328
00:19:01,336 --> 00:19:02,776
他以为那就是警察
He assumed it was the police.

329
00:19:02,811 --> 00:19:05,579
我发现了这个
I found this.

330
00:19:05,613 --> 00:19:06,814
哪儿来的?
Where?

331
00:19:06,848 --> 00:19:10,750
大门外的水沟槽
In the gutter just outside the main entrance.

332
00:19:10,784 --> 00:19:14,321
通知警方吗?
Shall I notify the police?

333
00:19:14,355 --> 00:19:15,788
不
No.

334
00:19:15,823 --> 00:19:17,824
有这个就够了
This is all I need.

335
00:19:23,531 --> 00:19:24,631
我以为
I was beginning to think

336
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:26,700
我得独自开始了
I would be forced to start without you.

337
00:19:26,734 --> 00:19:28,634
我有紧急事务要处理
I had an urgent matter to attend to.

338
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:31,670
还有比这更紧急的吗?
And what could be more urgent than this?

339
00:19:31,705 --> 00:19:33,539

340
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:37,043
我终于有了Renfield的线索
I finally have a lead on Renfield.

341
00:19:37,077 --> 00:19:39,078
可以开始了吗?
Shall we proceed?

342
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,455
首先从心脏开始
First, we start its heart.

343
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:55,060
1,000伏  一圈
1,000 volts, circuit one.

344
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,548
3,000伏!
3,000 volts!

345
00:20:24,222 --> 00:20:27,258
3,000伏  一圈
3,000 volts, circuit one.

346
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:49,113
有心跳了
It's beating.

347
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,327
成功了
Success.

348
00:22:13,854 --> 00:22:16,221
你现在不能走!
You can't leave now!

349
00:22:16,256 --> 00:22:18,757
我必须去找Renfield
I must find Renfield.

350
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:20,092
你要举行一个派对
You are about to host a party

351
00:22:20,126 --> 00:22:23,329
恶龙会的人都要出席
at which known members of the Order will be present.

352
00:22:23,363 --> 00:22:25,995
教授  如果你不想失去手臂  
Professor, if you ever valued that arm, 

353
00:22:25,996 --> 00:22:26,698
就放开我
take it off mine...

354
00:22:26,732 --> 00:22:28,733
马上!
immediately!

355
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:00,356
你好
Hello.

356

358

见到你很高兴
Lovely to see you.

359
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:11,500
我向他保证我不会跳得和熊一样
I promised him I will not do my dancing bear.

360
00:24:15,705 --> 00:24:17,940
我想我应该去照看一下女士们了
I think it's time for me to see to the women.

361
00:24:17,974 --> 00:24:20,241
如果你原谅我的失礼的话
If you will excuse me.

362
00:24:25,748 --> 00:24:27,182
- Jonathan  -Murray医生

363
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:29,384

364
00:24:29,418 --> 00:24:32,420
谢谢
Thank you.

365
00:24:36,692 --> 00:24:37,658
你是对的
You were right.

366
00:24:37,693 --> 00:24:39,927
我开始忘记我是谁了
I was beginning to forget who I am.

367
00:24:42,431 --> 00:24:44,365
我不会忘
I never will.

368
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,367
我一直在你身边提醒你
And I will always be here to remind you.

369
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:49,403
你保证？
Promise?

370
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:02,923
我希望Grayson先生
I hope Mr. Grayson likes 

371
00:25:02,924 --> 00:25:04,151
喜欢我们的的布置
what we've done with the place.

372
00:25:04,185 --> 00:25:05,419
哦  他还没到么？
Well, he... He hasn't arrived?

373
00:25:05,453 --> 00:25:08,522
恩  没  还没呢  他仍在途中
Mm-mm, no, not yet. He's still to arrive.

374
00:25:14,129 --> 00:25:16,196
Grayson先生爱谁呢？
Who does Mr. Grayson love?

375
00:25:16,231 --> 00:25:18,564
Renfield先生 他爱谁呢？
Mr. Renfield, who does he love?

376
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:23,970
Alexander Grayson先生爱谁呢？
Who does Mr. Alexander Grayson love?

377
00:25:25,506 --> 00:25:27,240
我愿意提供给你
I am willing to offer you 20,000 

378
00:25:27,241 --> 00:25:28,975
20000美元
of your American dollars.

379
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:30,276
Grayson先生
Mr. Grayson,

380
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,912
你要么是个勇敢的人
you are either a very brave man...

381
00:25:32,947 --> 00:25:35,014
要么就是个蠢蛋
or a very foolish one.

382
00:25:35,048 --> 00:25:36,350
赤手空拳
This is a rough country 

383
00:25:36,351 --> 00:25:37,816
就敢过来
to be traveling unarmed.

384
00:25:39,886 --> 00:25:41,443
这个时候买矿是一个
This is a singularly inopportune moment 

385
00:25:41,444 --> 00:25:43,156
非常不凑巧的时间  先生
to purchase a mine, sir.

386
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:44,657
到底怎么回事?
What the hell?

387
00:25:44,691 --> 00:25:47,360
联邦税率正在上调
Federal taxes are set to escalate,

388
00:25:47,394 --> 00:25:50,463
如果你坚持要买
so if you insist on making the purchase,

389
00:25:50,497 --> 00:25:51,764
提供一个售后回租条款
make sure you tender an option

390
00:25:51,798 --> 00:25:55,433
可以减少损失
with a leaseback provision to avoid the levies.

391
00:25:55,468 --> 00:25:57,369
先生  来点威士忌怎么样?
Whiskey, sir?

392
00:25:57,403 --> 00:25:58,370
谢谢
Thank you.

393
00:25:58,404 --> 00:25:59,872
他们想杀了你
They mean to kill you.

394
00:25:59,906 --> 00:26:02,174
啊!
Unh!

395
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:03,642
你说的够多了
That's enough outta you.

396
00:26:03,677 --> 00:26:06,178
你感觉自己很聪明么？  恩？
You think you're so smart? Huh?

397
00:26:07,313 --> 00:26:09,414
来吧  伙计  一起吧
Come on, boys! Join in.

398
00:26:09,448 --> 00:26:10,549
恩!
Unh!

399
00:26:30,202 --> 00:26:31,669

Aah!

400
00:26:51,456 --> 00:26:55,092
你现在安全了
You're safe now.

401
00:26:55,126 --> 00:26:56,159
Renfield先生
Mr. Renfield?

402
00:26:57,995 --> 00:26:58,962
Renfield先生
Mr. Renfield.

403
00:27:00,664 --> 00:27:04,034
Grayson爱谁呢？
Who does Grayson love?

404
00:28:05,764 --> 00:28:08,364
奇怪了 没有指挥者的踪影呢
Curious. No sign of the ringmaster.

405
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,533
毫无疑问的是精心设计了他的大厅入口
No doubt choreographing his grand entrance.

406
00:28:10,568 --> 00:28:11,835
实际上我说的是他的手下
I actually meant his man.

407
00:28:11,869 --> 00:28:13,070
你知道的  那个大个头的家伙
You know, the very large one

408
00:28:13,104 --> 00:28:15,271
总做些夸张演讲的的家伙
who makes all the turgid announcements.

409
00:28:15,306 --> 00:28:17,006
他叫什么来着？
What's his name?

410
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,276
提到大厅入口
Speaking of grand entrances.

411
00:28:22,879 --> 00:28:24,725
她在找Grayson  
She's looking for Grayson. 

412
00:28:24,726 --> 00:28:25,781
你怎么知道的
How can you tell?

413
00:28:25,816 --> 00:28:27,617
因为只有他不在
Because he's the only one who isn't here.

414
00:28:27,651 --> 00:28:28,918
可怜的人啊
Poor thing.

415
00:28:28,952 --> 00:28:29,756
把她最好的青春
Spent her best years 

416
00:28:29,757 --> 00:28:31,020
花在了她喜欢的男人身上
having any man she pleases,

417
00:28:31,054 --> 00:28:32,622
但是现在呢？
but now?

418
00:28:32,656 --> 00:28:34,490
Wetherby小姐碰到了一个并不愉快的前景
Lady Wetherby faces the unpleasant prospect

419
00:28:34,524 --> 00:28:37,093
没有一个人是她内心想要的
of not having the one man she really wants

420
00:28:37,127 --> 00:28:40,129
而他的丈夫又枯萎在病床上
while her husband withers away in his sickbed.

421
00:29:00,082 --> 00:29:02,817
我为我的迟到表示歉意
I apologize for being late.

422
00:29:02,852 --> 00:29:04,853
我希望一切都如您所想  Murray小姐
I hope everything is as you wish, Miss Murray.

423
00:29:04,887 --> 00:29:06,554
非常感谢  为所有事
Thank you so much, for everything.

424
00:29:06,588 --> 00:29:08,589
恩


425
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,095
你看上去很漂亮
You look very lovely.

426
00:29:16,231 --> 00:29:19,433
请原谅我的失礼
You'll have to excuse me, hmm?

427
00:29:19,468 --> 00:29:22,102
- 顺便谢谢你  - 为什么？
- Thank you, incidentally. - What for?

428
00:29:22,137 --> 00:29:22,937
在你的帮助下  
With your help, 

429
00:29:22,938 --> 00:29:24,539
我们找到了Renfield的所在
we managed to locate Renfield.

430
00:29:24,573 --> 00:29:26,407
一言以蔽之  一切安好
Suffice it to say, all is good,

431
00:29:26,441 --> 00:29:29,410
尽管我还不知道谁应对此负责
though I'm no closer to knowing who's responsible.

432
00:29:29,444 --> 00:29:31,945
- 他？  - 他没事  我向你保证
- Is he... - He's quite all right. I assure you.

433
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,646
现在  关于Shaw将军
Now, what's this interesting

434
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:35,849
你有什么有趣的消息么？
news you have regarding General Shaw?

435
00:29:35,884 --> 00:29:37,818
- 相当棒的宴会  - 恩
- Quite the party. - Mm.

436
00:29:37,852 --> 00:29:41,555
他肯定是个很值钱的雇员
He must be a very valuable employee.

437
00:29:48,963 --> 00:29:50,831
你感觉Harker怎么样？
What do you think of Harker?

438
00:29:50,865 --> 00:29:52,066
我认为他会很有用
I think he could be useful.

439
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,400
如果一定要说点什么的话  
And if anything, 

440
00:29:53,401 --> 00:29:54,000
就是他有野心
he's ambitious.

441
00:29:54,034 --> 00:29:55,468
当然你没考虑招募新人
Surely you're not thinking of recruitment.

442
00:29:55,503 --> 00:29:57,237
恩  他还不够老练
Well, he's a little rough around the edges,

443
00:29:57,271 --> 00:29:59,472
但我们总得用点新鲜血液
but we could always use some fresh blood.

444
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:02,075
不列颠为对抗奥斯曼的战争武装得越多
The more Britain arms itself for war against the Ottomans,

445
00:30:02,109 --> 00:30:03,510
Shaw将军以权谋私的就越多
the more General Shaw stands to gain.

446
00:30:03,544 --> 00:30:06,379
实际上这个国家做的每一笔交易
On virtually every munitions deal this country makes,

447
00:30:06,414 --> 00:30:08,582
他都从中分成
he's getting a cut.

448
00:30:08,616 --> 00:30:11,350
合同总价值的10%
10% of the total value of the contracts.

449
00:30:11,384 --> 00:30:13,686
Harker  这些指控
Harker, these allegations...

450
00:30:13,721 --> 00:30:15,654
不只这些指控
More than allegations.

451
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:17,456
我查了他的账户  他们很是小心
I've checked his accounts. They're meticulous.

452
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:19,631
听着  Harker  
Look, Harker, 

453
00:30:19,632 --> 00:30:21,594
我的意图是使他陷入窘境
my intention was to embarrass the man,

454
00:30:21,628 --> 00:30:24,931
而不是查他老底起诉他
not have him dragged up on charges.

455
00:30:24,965 --> 00:30:26,898
但Shaw是个伪君子
But Shaw's a hypocrite.

456
00:30:26,933 --> 00:30:28,367
身居高位的卖国贼
A traitor of the highest order.

457
00:30:28,401 --> 00:30:31,604
你也没暗示我放手此事  对吗？
You're not suggesting I just let this go, are you?

458
00:30:31,638 --> 00:30:32,738
啊
Ah.

459
00:30:32,772 --> 00:30:36,041
Grayson先生  还有新郎
Mr. Grayson, and the groom.

460
00:30:36,075 --> 00:30:37,276
Jayne Wetherby女士
Lady Jayne Wetherby.

461
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:39,211
我邀请的她  希望你别介意
I invited her. I hope you don't mind.

462
00:30:39,246 --> 00:30:42,114
当然不
Of course not.

463
00:30:42,148 --> 00:30:44,850
恩  失陪一下
Um, if you'll excuse me.

464
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:48,319
Harker.
Harker.

465
00:30:48,354 --> 00:30:51,723
我想你了
I've missed you.

466
00:30:54,293 --> 00:30:57,562
你看起来如此的秀色可餐
You look absolutely ravishing.

467
00:30:58,831 --> 00:31:02,066
哦  那最好是赶紧就餐
Oh, far better to be ravished.

468
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,069
你刚才自己去哪里了？
Where have you been keeping yourself?

469
00:31:05,103 --> 00:31:06,034
貌似有人掳走
It seems somebody abducted 

470
00:31:06,035 --> 00:31:08,673
并折磨了我的人  Renfield
and tortured my man, Renfield.

471
00:31:08,707 --> 00:31:11,108
哦  天啊
Oh, good lord!

472
00:31:11,143 --> 00:31:13,711
为什么会有人做那事?
Why would someone do something like that?

473
00:31:18,283 --> 00:31:21,852
可能是一些过去的商业争斗
Probably some old business rival.

474
00:31:21,887 --> 00:31:23,487
别担心
And don't worry.

475
00:31:23,521 --> 00:31:24,855
事情都已经解决了
It's all been resolved.

476
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:27,158
- 可以吗  - 好
- Shall we?  - Yes.

477
00:31:29,394 --> 00:31:31,095
Grayson先生?
Uh, Mr. Grayson?

478
00:31:31,129 --> 00:31:33,297
请许我把你介绍给我老板
Please let me introduce you to my employer.

479
00:31:33,331 --> 00:31:36,132
Grayson先生  哦  Wetherby女士
Uh, Mr. Grayson, um, Lady Wetherby,

480
00:31:36,167 --> 00:31:37,801

欢迎来我家
Welcome to my home.

487
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:50,646
很高兴你能邀请我们
Very kind of you to have us.

488
00:31:52,349 --> 00:31:54,383
先生们  请原谅我们
Uh, gentlemen, please excuse us.

489
00:31:57,454 --> 00:32:00,089
我等不及去认识你了
I cannot wait to get you to myself.

490
00:32:00,124 --> 00:32:03,426
所以你会的
Hmm, and so you shall.

491
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:07,095
Grayson先生
Mr. Grayson.

492
00:32:25,514 --> 00:32:27,916
打扰一下  Grayson先生?  
Excuse me, Mr. Grayson?

493
00:32:27,951 --> 00:32:31,586
我想让你见见我的导师和朋友
I would like you to meet my mentor and my friend,

494
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,755
Van Helsing教授

495
00:32:33,789 --> 00:32:34,665
见到你真高兴  
It's a pleasure to meet you, 

496
00:32:34,666 --> 00:32:36,091
Van Helsing教授
Professor Van Helsing.

497
00:32:36,125 --> 00:32:38,093
很荣幸见到你
Honored to meet you.

498
00:32:38,127 --> 00:32:40,194
教授可是其领域的先驱啊
The Professor is a pioneer in his field.

499
00:32:40,229 --> 00:32:42,864
真的吗
Is that so?

500
00:32:49,372 --> 00:32:52,774
Grayson的人  Renfield被绑架了
Grayson's man, Mr. Renfield, was abducted.

501
00:32:52,808 --> 00:32:54,743
- 真的?  - 是真的 
- Really? - Mm.

502
00:32:54,777 --> 00:32:56,746
被绑走和虐待?  
Abducted and tortured. 

503
00:32:56,747 --> 00:32:58,279
是组织干的吗？
Was that Order business?

504
00:32:58,313 --> 00:33:01,548
当然不是
Absolutely not.

505
00:33:03,685 --> 00:33:05,353
Grayson先生一直都很热心
Mr. Grayson's been kind enough to give us

506
00:33:05,387 --> 00:33:07,355
为我们今晚的庆祝提供他的房子
his home for our celebration tonight.

507
00:33:07,389 --> 00:33:09,123
他确实非常慷慨

谢谢你  教授  乐意效劳

00:33:31,779 --> 00:33:33,246
怎么了教授?
Professor?

511
00:33:33,281 --> 00:33:36,983
一切还好吗?
Is everything all right?

512
00:33:37,018 --> 00:33:39,019
失陪一下
Excuse me.

513
00:33:42,731 --> 00:33:45,099
好了  先生们女士们
All right, ladies and gentlemen.

514
00:33:45,133 --> 00:33:46,353
为了我漂亮
For my beautiful daughter, 

515
00:33:46,354 --> 00:33:49,769
又让我总是骄傲的女儿Mina
Mina, who has always made me proud,

516
00:33:49,804 --> 00:33:53,405
还有我一直看做是儿子的Jonathan 
and for Jonathan, who I have long considered a son.

517
00:33:53,439 --> 00:33:57,009
Mina  我  希望你母亲能在这儿
Mina, I only wish your mother were here

518
00:33:57,043 --> 00:34:01,079
见证你变成的那个女人
to witness the woman that you've become.

519
00:34:01,114 --> 00:34:02,292
请和我一起
Please, join me 

520
00:34:02,293 --> 00:34:04,884
为这对儿快乐的夫妻举杯
in raising a glass to the happy couple.

521
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:06,351
为Mina和Jonathan
To Mina and Jonathan.

522
00:34:06,386 --> 00:34:08,654
为Mina和Jonathan!
To Mina and Jonathan!

523
00:34:15,528 --> 00:34:17,762
女士们先生们
Uh, ladies and gentlemen.

524
00:34:17,796 --> 00:34:18,872
今晚我想…
I'd, um, well, 

525
00:34:18,873 --> 00:34:22,100
我想从感谢Murray医师开始
I would like to start by thanking Dr. Murray,

526
00:34:22,135 --> 00:34:24,469
不仅仅是为他亲切的言词
not just for his kind words this evening

527
00:34:24,504 --> 00:34:28,272
还有他终生的善良热心
but for a whole lifetime of kindness,

528
00:34:28,306 --> 00:34:30,808
并允许我娶他的女儿来结束!
culminating in him allowing me to marry his daughter!

529
00:34:33,478 --> 00:34:35,097
我说"允许"  但是  
I say "Allowing," But, 

530
00:34:35,098 --> 00:34:36,447
恩  任何了解Mina的人
um, anyone who knows Mina

531
00:34:36,481 --> 00:34:38,683
都知道她只走自己认定的道路
knows that she follows her own path,

532
00:34:38,717 --> 00:34:40,130
而那条路… 
and that path... 

533
00:34:40,131 --> 00:34:42,486
那条指引她去使我这个
that path has led her to make me

534
00:34:42,521 --> 00:34:45,356
最最快乐幸运的人活着的道路
the very happiest and very luckiest man alive.

535
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:46,723
听  听
Hear, hear.

536
00:34:46,758 --> 00:34:48,192
Grayson先生!
Mr. Grayson!

537
00:34:48,226 --> 00:34:51,662
今晚的欢宴堪称盛景
Tonight's festivities are nothing short of spectacular.

538
00:34:51,696 --> 00:34:53,067
现在我已经苦苦思索良久
Now I've thought long and hard about 

539
00:34:53,068 --> 00:34:54,065
如何最好地去表达
how best to express

540
00:34:54,099 --> 00:34:55,899
我对你的感激之情
my gratitude to you,

541
00:34:55,934 --> 00:35:00,737
最后  我决定为你提供对我来说
and in the end, decided that it's right for me

542
00:35:00,772 --> 00:35:04,007
最最珍贵的东西…
to offer you what I consider most precious...

543
00:35:04,042 --> 00:35:06,396
第一曲舞的特权
The privilege of the first dance.

544
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:19,172
能换我吗？
May I cut in?

545
00:37:31,884 --> 00:37:33,885
抱歉  我得透透气
Excuse me. I need some air.

546
00:37:39,258 --> 00:37:42,961
Grayson有个秘密  我能看得出来
Grayson has a secret. I can tell.

547
00:37:42,995 --> 00:37:45,430
那会是什么？
And what might that be?

548
00:37:45,464 --> 00:37:48,166
我不完全确定
I'm not entirely sure.

549
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,802
他是个没有档案的神秘家伙
He's a man of mystery without biography.

550
00:37:50,836 --> 00:37:53,805
好吧  对于一个美国人来说那是很寻常的
Well, that's hardly unusual for an American.

551
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:56,207
那些反对他的人经常最后成死鬼了
Those who oppose him frequently end up dead.

552
00:37:56,242 --> 00:37:57,353
那些经常反对你的
Those that oppose you 

553
00:37:57,354 --> 00:37:58,743
最后经常也会以死告终
frequently end up dead.

554
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:01,011
这只是巧合  再无其它
It's coincidence. Nothing more.

555
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:05,115
说到
Speaking of which,

556
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,717
他来到伦敦
his arrival in London

557
00:38:06,752 --> 00:38:09,253
牵涉到了一些非常不吉利的东西
coincided with something rather more ominous.

558
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,888
哪个？
Which is?

559
00:38:10,923 --> 00:38:14,759
你搜寻的老东西出现了
The advent of the old one you seek.

560
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:17,461
我给你带来了那老东西的骨灰  在罐子里
I brought you the old one's ashes in a jar.

561
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:20,296
是吗？
Did you?

562
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:23,900
Alexander Grayson  一个吸…
Alexander Grayson, a vamp...

563
00:38:23,935 --> 00:38:26,235
荒谬  不可能
Ridiculous. Never.

564
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,275
你不会是第一个
You would not be the first woman 

565
00:38:28,276 --> 00:38:31,140
被欲望蒙蔽眼睛的女人
to be blinded by desire.

566
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:34,877
第一个猎人  是的…
The first huntsman, yes...

567
00:38:34,911 --> 00:38:38,881
但不是第一个女人
but not the first woman.

568
00:39:04,907 --> 00:39:08,610
滚开!
Go away!

569
00:40:02,229 --> 00:40:04,164
我在纽约获悉这儿的很多消息
A lot of information I learned here in New York

570
00:40:04,198 --> 00:40:05,798
我在Charles Remick学法律时
while I was studying law

571
00:40:05,832 --> 00:40:09,436
一个主张废除死刑的人
under Charles Remick, a white abolitionist.

572
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:12,638
提议我在密苏里酒吧接受考试
He made a motion I be examined under the Missouri bar.

573
00:40:12,673 --> 00:40:16,308
我猜测你通过了
I presume you passed.

574
00:40:16,342 --> 00:40:17,877
我加入了圣路易斯的一家公司
I joined a firm in St. Louis

575
00:40:17,911 --> 00:40:19,178
而且被送到西部
and was sent out west

576
00:40:19,179 --> 00:40:20,446
去处理反索赔的事
 to sort out a cross-claim.

577
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,883
委托人反对我的种族
The client took exception to my race.

578
00:40:23,917 --> 00:40:25,950
因为我为自己辩护 
I was set upon by ruffians, 

579
00:40:25,951 --> 00:40:28,888
我被恶棍袭击  而且被囚禁
and imprisoned for the crime of defending myself.

580
00:40:28,922 --> 00:40:31,423
圣路易斯的公司怎么说?
What about the firm in St. Louis?

581
00:40:31,458 --> 00:40:33,459
他们和我摆脱了关系
Well, they washed their hands of me.

582
00:40:33,493 --> 00:40:37,496
我怀疑他们一直都这样想的
I suspect that was their intent all along.

583
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:40,566
无亲无友  身无分文
I was left friendless and penniless.

584
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,668
只能说…
Suffice to say...

585
00:40:43,703 --> 00:40:47,806
事情并未按计划进行
things did not go to plan.

586
00:40:56,281 --> 00:40:59,985
对这一切我心存感激  先生
I'm very grateful for this, sir.

587
00:41:00,019 --> 00:41:02,562
希望你别介意我问一句
I hope I don't undermine that 

588
00:41:02,563 --> 00:41:04,088
“为什么？”
gratitude by asking, "Why?"

589
00:41:04,123 --> 00:41:07,558
你是一名高水准的律师  Renfield
You're a lawyer of the highest caliber, Renfield.

590
00:41:07,593 --> 00:41:10,961
我需要一名律师
I require a lawyer.

591
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:21,872
我太了解流浪的滋味儿了
I too know what it's like to live as an outcast,

592
00:41:21,906 --> 00:41:25,094
我外表看起来高端大气 
outside what passes for polite society, 

593
00:41:25,095 --> 00:41:26,076
其实不然
but rarely is.

594
00:41:28,379 --> 00:41:32,082
绝对超乎你的想象
More than you could possibly imagine.

595
00:41:32,117 --> 00:41:36,620
你是谜一样的男人  Grayson先生
You are a man of secrets, Mr. Grayson.

596
00:41:36,654 --> 00:41:39,055
我只能这样说
That much, I can see.

597
00:41:39,089 --> 00:41:41,109
但为了我的职业操守 
But I owe it to my profession and my good name

598
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:43,332
和职业信誉  我得说  
to tell you that I can only work for a man 

599
00:41:43,333 --> 00:41:46,363
我只为完全信任的人工作
who trusts me completely.

600
00:42:06,516 --> 00:42:10,052
那我告诉你我所有的秘密
Then you shall know all my secrets,

601
00:42:10,086 --> 00:42:13,822
你的人生将从此改变
and your life will never be the same.

602
00:42:17,894 --> 00:42:21,597
所以这算承诺吗？
Is that a promise?

603
00:16:35,597 --> 00:16:37,597
12年前
