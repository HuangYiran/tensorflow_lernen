1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,700
你找我吗
You wanted to see me?

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,330
我想知道为什么
May I ask why

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:08,130
自从我掌管这个基地以来
You have not filed a single mission report

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,630
你从来都没交过任务报告
Since I assumed command of this base?

5
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,160
因为我不交任务报告
'cause I haven't given you any?

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,460
我对这里作出了一些新规定
As you know, one of the changes I made around here

7
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:20,560
其中包括了每位组员都必须写任务报告
Is to require every team member to file mission reports,

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,930
而不是只有组长或者科研人员要写
As opposed to only team leaders and science officers.

9
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:24,630
真的?
Really.

10
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:25,930
我一点都不知道
I didn't-- I didn't know that.

11
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:27,860
我来这里的第4天就宣布了
I announced it my fourth day here,

12
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,430
是在一个小组的出发准备会上
At an away-team orientation meeting

13
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,100
对任务协议书作出的细节变更
Detailing changes to mission protocol.

14
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,100
我参加了吗
Was I there?

15
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,600
是的  这个会议是强制参加的
Yes. it was mandatory.

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,160
好像我不太记得...
Because I don't remember--

17
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,430
我看到你的
I saw you there.

18
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:39,760
老实说  想无视你还真有点困难
It's kind of hard to miss you.

19
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,830
我的意思是
Look, my point is

20
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:47,760
你在每次任务之后要写任务报告
I want you to file a report every mission.

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,260
我不擅长文笔
I'm not good at writing.

22
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,800
我预料到你会这么说的
I figured you might say that.

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,560
用这个
Use this.

24
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,930
这是数码录音机
It's a digital voice recorder.

25
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,130
对着它说话  我们会把它连上
Speak into it, we'll plug it in,

26
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:59,460
然后你的报告
And your report

27
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,760
会被自动记录下来  然后生成文档
Will be automatically transcribed and filed

28
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,830
和别人的放在一起
With the others.

29
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,030
我也不太擅长说话
I'm not good at talking, either.

30
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,970
不好意思啊
Oh, I'm sorry.

31
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,100
我跑得太快了点  老兄
Too fast for you, buddy boy?

32
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,770
我刚接到疗养院的电话  罗德尼
Nursing home just called, rodney.

33
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,030
他们想要回那个滑板车
They want their scooter back.

34
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,600
滑板车?  我那引擎盖下的可是
Scooter? that is a tri-cell li-po pack

35
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,400
三组的锂离子电池
Under my hood, son.

36
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,170
对不起了  是我不好
Ooh, sorry. my bad.

37
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,330
我要把你踩在脚底
Yeah, I will trample you.

38
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:30,530
别被你自己的裙子绊倒了
Well, don't trip on your skirt.

39
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:34,470
没事吧
You okay?

40
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,100
他差点就掉下来了
I could have dropped him!

41
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,430
对不起  我不知道这里会有人
Sorry, we didn't know anyone was around.

42
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:37,900
你真的没事吧
You sure you're all right?

43
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,970
话说回来
Come to think of it,

44
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:39,870
你在这儿干嘛
What are you doing down here anyway?

45
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,500
我在哄图门睡觉
Trying to get torren to sleep.

46
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,230
我发现抱着他到处走最能让他安心
I find that walking him is the best way to calm him.

47
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,030
他害疝气了吧
Ooh, he's colicky, huh?

48
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,630
凯勒医生说这些症状会消失的
Dr. keller says it's a phase that will pass.

49
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,170
不用担心了  我小时候也得过疝气
Oh, don't worry about it.I was a colicky baby too.

50
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,130
你就学我妈那样好了  让我哭到睡着
Just do what my mom did,which was let me cry myself to sleep.

51
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,300
反正又不会恶化
I'm no worse for it.

52
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,070
反正
Anyway...

53
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,670
我们是轮流抱他走路
We usually take turns walking him,

54
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,100
但迦楠去视察民情了
But kanaan is away visiting our people

55
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,230
他要不在好几天
For a few days.

56
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:01,730
我很想帮你  但好像
I'd help you out, but it looks

57
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,330
你已经把一切问题都解决了
Like you've got everything taken care of.

58
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,570
是的  我现在正要把他带回房间
Yes. now all I have to do is get him back to my quarters

59
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,370
不能吵醒他
Without waking him...

60
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,700
更不能被汽车压到
Or being run over.

61
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,770
我们不玩了
Yeah, we're done here.

62
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,600
我们就快结束了
We're just, you know, finishing up,

63
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,870
真的
Really, so...

64
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,700
晚安
'night.

65
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,700
晚安  好梦
'night. good one.

66
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,930
冲冲冲冲冲
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

67
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,330
我好像把马达用过头了
I must have put too much strain on the motor.

68
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:49,470
得给轴上一点润滑油
Shaft needs a bushing lube.

69
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,030
干嘛
What?

70
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,330
这算什么意思
What's that about?

71
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:56,400
不知道
Beats me.

72
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,170
瑞迪克
Radek?

73
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,400
进来
Come in.

74
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,930
指挥室  我是麦凯博士
Control room, it's dr. mckay.

75
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,230
东区停电了
We just lost power in the east pier.

76
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,730
怎么回事
What's going on?

77
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,600
怪了
That's strange.

78
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,770
除了指挥室之外
Lights are out all over the city

79
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:20,600
整个城市都停电了
Except the control room.

80
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,530
搞什么啊
Why is that?

81
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,770
麦凯博士
This is dr. rodney mckay,

82
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:24,900
呼叫指挥室
Calling anyone in the control room.

83
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,630
请回话
Please respond.

84
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:31,230
肯定是出问题了
Something's definitely not right.

85
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:52,930
罗德尼  你在吗
Rodney, are you there?

86
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,300
谢帕德中校
Colonel sheppard?

87
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,100
什么都用不了
Everything's dead.

88
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,430
我们没法调查出了什么问题
There's no way of knowing what the hell's going on.

89
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,900
好吧  里维斯
All right. hey, rivers.

90
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,070
分散行动
Fan out,

91
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,300
尽可能多找一些船
Find as many marines as you can,

92
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,500
向控制塔上进发
Work your way up to the central tower.

93
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,930
如果你碰到伍尔希的话就通知我
If you run into woolsey, let me know.

94
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:18,230
通讯设施瘫痪了  我们用对讲机
Communications are down. we're on walkies.

95
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,800
瑞迪克
Radek!

96
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,870
罗德尼  怎么回事
Rodney, what's going on?

97
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,100
什么  你也不知道?
What, you don't know either?

98
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:22,930
我准备去控制塔
I'm on my way to the control tower.

99
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,130
还想和你通话呢
I tried to radio you.

100
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,030
除了控制塔之外
Power's out

101
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,370
其他地方都没电了  给你
Except for the central tower. here.

102
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:27,630
你干脆去主电室
Go to the main power room instead.

103
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,430
看看是不是能重启一下电力系统
See if you can reboot the system from there.

104
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,100
好的
Okay. all right.

105
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,470
好的
All right.

106
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,430
是谁
Hello?

107
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,400
罗德尼  听得见吗
Rodney, do you read me?

108
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,730
听得见  瑞迪克  你说
Yeah, radek. go ahead.

109
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:01,930
我试过重启系统
I've tried to restart power.

110
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,700
但目前一点都没进展
So far, absolutely no success.

111
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,500
那零点装置呢
What about the zpm?

112
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,900
我检查过了
I've checked it,

113
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,830
还有Naquadah发电器
As well as the naquadah generator.

114
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,170
它们都没联机
Neither are online.

115
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,330
肯定是有人在控制室里把它们拔掉了
Someone must have disabled them from the control room.

116
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,770
如果是这样的话
If that was the case,

117
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,370
他们自己也会没电的
Then they wouldn't have any power up there either.

118
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,370
他们可能用的是外接电源
Not unless they're using an external power source.

119
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:19,200
听我说
Okay, listen to me.

120
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,670
你也试试这么做
I want you to do exactly the same thing.

121
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,570
启用临时补丁
Initiate a temporary patch

122
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,430
连接外部电源
Using an external power source--

123
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,970
就是那个辅助电池组
One of the auxiliary battery units.

124
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,600
可以  但这点电源维持不了整个城市
Yes, but that won't be enough to power the entire city,

125
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,430
根本不可能
Not by a long shot.

126
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,000
这你别担心
Don't worry about that.

127
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,270
只要给我能启动主机的能量就行
Just get me enough juice to access the mainframe.

128
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,600
我们去查一下
We can figure out

129
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,170
那里到底出了什么问题
What the hell's going on up there.

130
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,330
好的
All right.

131
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:35,130
你现在在几层
Whereabouts are you right now?

132
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,700
36层?
Level 36?

133
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,700
35层
35.

134
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,800
太好了  35层
Oh, great. 35. perfect.

135
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,430
只剩28层了
So just another 28 floors to go,

136
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,000
只要走走楼梯
And that's just this stairwell.

137
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,700
就能到63楼
And then we get to level 63,

138
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,930
穿过一条辅助楼梯
Got to cross over to an ancillary stairwell,

139
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,200
再往上爬4楼
Climb another four levels--

140
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,000
只不过是到了星门室
That's just to access the gate room...

141
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,270
这样
Ooh, you know,

142
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,230
你在操作的同时
See if you can route some of that power

143
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,070
看看是不是能
To the transporters

144
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:53,900
把传输机的电源也接上
While you're at it.

145
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,800
好的  我试试
All right, I'll try.

146
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,970
这扇门是通向星门室的楼梯  是吧
This door leads to the gate room stairwell,right?

147
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:22,770
是啊
Yeah.

148
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:24,870
也许在停电的时候
Well, maybe the door was already closed

149
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,400
这扇门就是关着的
When we lost power.

150
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,230
这门是故意被关死的  好让我们不能进去
It was sealed on purpose to keep people out.

151
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,900
什么  你是说有人在入侵亚特兰蒂斯?
What, you think someone's infiltrated atlantis?

152
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,630
罗德尼
Rodney.

153
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,770
说吧
Talk to me.

154
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,200
我启动了临时补丁
I've initiated a temporary patch.

155
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,270
我可以把部分的电力传送到你的实验室
I was able to route partial power to your lab.

156
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,630
那传输机呢
Well, what about the transporters?

157
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,030
我还在弄
Still working on it.

158
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,330
恢复某一台之后再通知我
Yeah, well, let me know when you've got one online.

159
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,630
去实验室试试接进主机
Go to your lab and try to tap into the mainframe.

160
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,330
我走另一条楼梯
I'll try the other stairwells.

161
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,200
说不定也过不去  谁知道呢
They're probably blocked too, but who knows.

162
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,700
也许别的地方能上去
Maybe there's another way up.

163
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,870
好吧
All right.

164
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,370
中校
Colonel.

165
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,330
这也封死了吗
That one sealed too?

166
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:58,930
对  所有楼梯通道都是
Yeah, all the stairwell doors are.

167
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:00,230
正在想办法上星门室
Been trying to find a way up to the gate room

168
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,230
断电之后一直在想办法
Since the power went out.

169
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,400
我们也是
Yeah, so have we.

170
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,230
知道怎么回事吗
Any idea what's going on yet?

171
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,030
麦凯在找原因
Mckay's still working on it.

172
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:06,730
我估计用c-4能把门炸穿
I guess we could blow the door with c-4.

173
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:07,630
是啊  应该可以
Yeah, we probably will,

174
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,570
但至少得先找到门
But we're not there yet.

175
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:09,400
我去看看到底怎么回事
I need to know what we're up against

176
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,730
免得在这里死不瞑目
Before we go storming up there.

177
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,230
有发现吗
Any luck?

178
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,570
没啥
Not much.

179
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:22,230
不过你说中了  的确有人入侵亚特兰蒂斯
You're right, though. someone's taken over atlantis.

180
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,400
把主机黑了
They hacked into the mainframe.

181
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,870
我费了半天劲
I'm having a hard time

182
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,100
想进几个主要系统
Accessing several of the critical systems.

183
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,400
唯一能进去的还是只读的
And the ones that I can access are read-only.

184
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,500
你怎么
Hey, what're you...

185
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,700
你怎么这么快就到了
How did you get up here so fast?

186
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,230
我修好了几个
Oh, I was able to get some of the transporters

187
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:34,100
传输机
Back online again.

188
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,700
去星门室那层的修好了吗
What about the transporter on the gate room level?

189
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,870
很不幸  没有
No, sadly, no.

190
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:37,870
那层设了个封闭指令
There's a lockout code in place on that one.

191
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,200
监控录像
Surveillance cameras.

192
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,470
我们在控制室和星门室
We've got closed-circuit feeds

193
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,100
设置了独立回路参数
On the control room and the gate room.

194
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,800
只要没被锁在那里面
If you're not locked out of those as well.

195
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,830
它们不属于主系统
They're not critical systems.

196
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,330
我应该进得去
I should be able to access them if...

197
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:52,330
搞定
Got it.

198
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,870
小型飞船?
A puddle jumper?

199
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,400
那是谁
Who is that?

200
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,800
显然不是亚特兰蒂斯人
It's definitely not atlantis personnel.

201
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,370
能看到伍尔希的办公室吗
Can you get a feed on woolsey's office?

202
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,170
可以  等一下
Yeah, hang on.

203
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:12,300
我的老天
Oh, my god.

204
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:24,700
那不是
Is that...?

205
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,870
正是
Yeah.

206
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:31,970
迈克尔
Michael.

207
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,370
你好  泰勒
hello,teyla

208
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,500
你怎么进来的
How did you get here?

209
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,900
我从你们那儿"借"了个飞船
The ship I borrowed from your people.

210
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,000
附赠了丰富的信息
It has provided me with a wealth of information

211
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,270
和技术
And technology...

212
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:48,370
还送了我一把万能钥匙
And the key to infiltrating this base.

213
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:49,400
开这个门
Use this.

214
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,700
这是个数码录音笔
It's a digital voice recorder.

215
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,270
对它讲话  然后插入电脑
Speak into it, we'll plug it in,

216
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,130
你说的话就被自动记录下来
And your report will be automatically transcribed

217
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,400
然后和其他人的一起归档了
And filed with the others.

218
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,430
我也不太擅长说话
I'm not good at talking, either.

219
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:03,800
临时外来激活
Unscheduled off-world activation.

220
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,470
防护盾打开了吗
Is the shield raised?

221
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,170
是的  长官
Yes, sir.

222
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:15,000
奈尔森中士的虹膜解除码
Major nelson's idc.

223
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,430
他们来早了
They're early.

224
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:19,230
按计划明天才到
Not due back until tomorrow.

225
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:21,530
好吧  让他们进来
All right, let them in.

226
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,800
怎么没停到飞船停泊舱去
It's not going up to the jumper bay.

227
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,930
怎么回事
What's wrong?

228
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:36,070
奈尔森中士  情况如何
Major nelson, what's your status?

229
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,930
什么东西
What is that?

230
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:46,700
紧急疏散
Get everybody out of here.

231
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,270
快疏散
Get 'em out now!

232
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:24,000
关闭所有紧急通道
Closing all immediate access doors.

233
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:34,570
入口护盾已经激活
I've activated the portal's shield.

234
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,200
很好
Good.

235
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,970
外网电源呢
What about the external power interface?

236
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:40,100
连接上了
We're connected.

237
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,470
星门室那层
The control room level

238
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,270
直接由飞船供源
Is now drawing power directly from the ship.

239
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,170
电击力场准备好了吗
Is the stun field holding?

240
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,730
好了
Yes.

241
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,270
我们上下两层保护起来
Two levels above and below us are protected.

242
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:51,430
可以开工了
Now we can get to work.

243
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:53,300
开什么工
Get to work on what?

244
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,700
原谅我
Forgive me.

245
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,470
忘了恭喜你
I forgot to congratulate you.

246
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,430
他叫什么
What's his name?

247
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:10,470
算了
No matter.

248
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,770
恐怕我们时间不多了
We don't have much time, I'm afraid.

249
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:14,100
我手下的变种人正在准备
My hybrids are preparing

250
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,870
启动亚特兰蒂斯的自毁系统
To activate atlantis' self-destruct device.

251
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:20,300
他们一启动  我们就离开
As soon as they do that, we will leave.

252
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,770
你要毁掉亚特兰蒂斯
You're going to destroy atlantis?

253
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:25,130
罪有应得
A punishment richly deserved.

254
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:27,830
我不指望你同意
Not that I expect you to agree with me.

255
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,230
不过别担心
But don't worry.

256
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,430
你的孩子会很安全
Your baby will be safe.

257
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,470
你不能带走我的孩子
You are not taking my son.

258
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:36,230
我会带走他  泰勒
Yes, teyla. I am.

259
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:41,130
你的孩子对我很重要
You know how important your child is to me.

260
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:43,400
你和他父亲赋予了他强大的力量
His father and you have given him a powerful gift

261
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,930
若能被我所用
That I will utilize

262
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:48,530
我就能彻底控制那些变种人了
To exert greater control over my legion of hybrids.

263
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:52,300
想要变强  没他不行
He is the key to increasing my strength,

264
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,230
他将使我统领整个星系
Securing my reign over the galaxy.

265
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:56,830
别做你的帝王梦了
Your "reign" is over.

266
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:58,370
你别想活着带走他
You will not make it out of here alive.

267
00:12:58,370 --> 00:12:59,400
我的同伴肯定会
My people will make certain--

268
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,400
够了  够了
Enough! enough.

269
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:03,830
你以为你削弱了我的力量
You think you've weakened me.

270
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:06,400
你毁了我的基地
You've destroyed my facilities,

271
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,830
毁了我的研究  但你不能
Ruined much of my research, but you cannot--

272
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,300
你不能
You cannot--

273
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,200
动摇我的决心
Weaken my resolve.

274
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,970
别犯傻了  泰勒
Make no mistake, teyla.

275
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:18,930
我前所未有的强大
I am as strong now as I have ever been.

276
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:22,770
看看周围
Look around you.

277
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:25,270
我控制着亚特兰蒂斯
I am in control of atlantis,

278
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,700
就是在这儿
The very place

279
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,600
我依稀记得被你们杀掉的滋味
Where your people ended my life as I knew it.

280
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,330
是时候回来
It's only fitting that I return...

281
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:36,370
让它永远的从银河系里
To extinguish this blight from the galaxy

282
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:38,600
消失了
Once and for all.

283
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,030
我还以为迈克尔死了
I thought michael was dead.

284
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,830
是啊
As did i.

285
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:46,170
咱们不是把他的船都炸飞了吗
I mean, we blew up his ship, right?

286
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:47,770
就是他偷了我们的飞船
He's the one who stole our jumper,

287
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,300
在我们炸他之前
Used it to escape from his cruiser

288
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,400
从舰上逃走了
Before we could destroy it.

289
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,570
顽强如小强
He's like a cockroach.

290
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:52,530
每次就快踩着时
Every time you try to step on him,

291
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,330
就溜的没影了
He just skitters away.

292
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:56,200
好了  我们得开始行动了
All right, we need to get moving.

293
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,800
罗恩  你带人从这边楼梯走
Lorne, you and your team take this stairwell.

294
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,770
我们走这条
My team will take this stairwell.

295
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,070
在各自位置守好
We move into position.

296
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,370
等我信号就炸门
You wait for my mark to blast the door.

297
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,270
我们冲进去  夺回星门室
We head up, retake the gate room.

298
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,430
麦凯  你跟着我
Mckay, you're with me.

299
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:07,730
泽兰卡留守  努力解码
Zelenka, stay here, try to figure this thing out.

300
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,130
遵命
Certainly.

301
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,470
对迈克尔绝不能手软
We're giving michael no quarter.

302
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:12,300
击中他  就别停
If you get a shot at him, take it.

303
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,030
确保弄死他
Make sure he's dead.

304
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:16,500
行动
Let's move.

305
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,170
我得跟你谈谈
I must speak with you.

306
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,030
我们还是无法激活
We are still having difficulty

307
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,800
自毁系统
With the self-destruct device.

308
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,700
为什么
Why?

309
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,730
我说过
As I told you,

310
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:02,900
密码比我们预计的
The encryption is much more complex

311
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,400
复杂很多
Than we had anticipated.

312
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,130
我们试了几组质因子算法
We have run several integer factorization algorithms.

313
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:08,470
都不行
Nothing has worked so far.

314
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,670
那就继续算
Keep at it.

315
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,370
算多久
For how long?

316
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,400
直到算出来为止
As long as it takes.

317
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,070
他们突破我们的防御
It is only a matter of time

318
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:19,230
是迟早的事
Before the others figure out a way through our defenses.

319
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,570
我知道
I know.

320
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:21,670
那你就赶在他们之前
But you will have solved the encryption problem

321
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,700
解开密码
Before then.

322
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:26,930
我们已经找到孩子了
We have the baby.

323
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,400
没必要再耗在这儿
We don't have to remain here.

324
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,500
那装置没激活我们就不走
We are not leaving until that device is armed.

325
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,270
出问题了吧
Problems?

326
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,800
没什么解决不了的
Nothing that can't be dealt with.

327
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,230
你应该知道谢帕德中校
You do know that colonel sheppard

328
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,670
一定在组织突击队
Is no doubt preparing strike teams

329
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,770
要夺回星门室
To retake the gate room.

330
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:49,230
当然
Of course,

331
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:51,230
或许在我们谈话的时候  他们就会来
Probably moving them into place as we speak.

332
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:54,300
别担心
Don't worry.

333
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,430
他们进不来
They're not getting in here.

334
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,100
少校  你那边情况怎样
Major, what's your status?

335
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,600
回中校  C-4准备好  只等你的指示
C-4 is in place, colonel. ready when you are.

336
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,600
准备爆破
Fire in the hole.

337
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,630
准备
On my mark.

338
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:23,370
三  二  一
Three, two, one,

339
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:24,270
爆破
Mark.

340
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,170
行动
Move!

341
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:42,930
慢着  数据显示上面有巨大能量
Whoa, whoa, we're picking up a serious energy reading up ahead.

342
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:43,930
怎么回事
What is it?

343
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:46,570
不清楚  搞清楚前不要轻举妄动
I don't know, but we should stop until I do.

344
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:50,000
罗恩少校  停下
Major lorne, hold up.

345
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:58,000
谢帕德中校  罗恩少校晕倒了
Colonel sheppard, major lorne is down.

346
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,800
发生什么事了
What happened?

347
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,030
不知道
I don't know.

348
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,830
可能是撞到某种力场
I think he hit some kind of force field.

349
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,570
他还活着  但没有知觉
He's alive, but unconscious.

350
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:07,830
把他抬出去  撤退
Get him out of there and fall back.

351
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:10,570
看来他还建了一个力场
Looks like he's got himself a force field.

352
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:12,900
他要不那么勤奋  早废了
He's nothing if not annoyingly industrious.

353
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,170
说得有理  我们现在该怎办
All right, what do we do?

354
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:15,230
关了它
Well, we disable it.

355
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,030
怎么做
How?

356
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:18,730
问...得好
good question

357
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:25,230
我不断检查收到的能量读数
I've been examining the energy reading we picked up,

358
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:28,470
看来迈克尔改良过了
And it appears that michael has somehow managed to modify

359
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,830
幽灵人的电流脉冲技术
The wraith stun-pulse technology

360
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:32,200
结合了小型飞船隐形技术
And integrate it with the puddle jumper cloaking mechanism--

361
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,300
创造出了所谓的"电击泡泡"
Creating a kind of "stun-bubble"--

362
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,630
不  是力场
No, a force field

363
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,670
围绕在控制室和星门室周围
Around the control room and the gate room.

364
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,330
听着  只要它在那儿  我们别想进去
Look, while it's in place, we're not getting in there.

365
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:40,900
我知道
Well, I know that.

366
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,070
你还没告诉我怎么关了它
What you haven't told me is how we're gonna turn it off.

367
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,400
我们还没想出对策
Because we haven't figured that out yet.

368
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,870
这得靠技巧才行
Look, it's going to be very tricky.

369
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,030
迈克尔用小型飞船
Yeah, you see, michael is using the puddle jumper

370
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,430
作为外部电源
As an external power source,

371
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,830
不仅供给控制室和星门室
Not only for the control room and the gate room,

372
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,900
还要支持"电击泡泡"的运作
But also, he's using it to power the stun-bubble--

373
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,130
够了  别提那个"电击泡泡"
Okay, enough with the "stun-bubble."

374
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:54,370
这表达很准确
That's an accurate description--

375
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:56,230
不  这表达很白痴
No, it's a stupid description--

376
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:57,170
兄弟们
Guys, guys...

377
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:58,230
听着  问题是
Look, the point is

378
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,400
如果我们要停止那个电击...
That if we want to disable the stun--

379
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,030
力场的运作
The force field,

380
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,930
我们要先切断飞船的能源
Then we first need to disable the power from the jumper.

381
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,030
或者  我们另行其道
Or we figure out a way

382
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:07,170
切断迈克尔对主机的控制
To override the mainframe lockouts that michael has in place.

383
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,370
这又要怎么做
All right, how's that going?

384
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:09,730
不可行
It's not.

385
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:10,870
暂时
Not yet.

386
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,430
继续努力吧
Keep working on it.

387
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,170
我去看看罗恩
I'm going to check on lorne.

388
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:28,800
发生什么事
What happened?

389
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,130
一艘小型飞船突袭
That puddle jumper that came through...

390
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:32,370
发出某种电波
It sent out some kind of stun wave,

391
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:33,530
把所有人都击晕了
Knocked everybody out.

392
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:36,570
所有亚特兰蒂斯人
All of atlantis?

393
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:37,670
不清楚
I don't know.

394
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:39,070
可能吧
Probably.

395
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:47,230
别担心  他们快醒了
Don't worry, they'll wake up soon.

396
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:49,470
每个人的抵抗力不同
Everyone has a different level of resistance.

397
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:50,470
来
Here.

398
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:51,800
谁做的
Who would do this?

399
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,030
不知道  我正想查个清楚
I don't know. that's what I want to find out.

400
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,730
你能打开那扇门吗
Can you open that door?

401
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:56,570
可以
I think so.

402
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:57,900
好的  上
Good. do it.

403
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:13,030
还是没反应
Still nothing.

404
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:26,300
泰勒  有段时间你还是挺理解我的
There was a time you understood me, teyla.

405
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,000
我被你们的人带来
When your people brought me here,

406
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,700
注射逆转录病毒  将我变成人类
Gave me the retrovirus that turned me into a human,

407
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:35,770
只有你同情我
You alone showed me compassion.

408
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:38,370
只有你有良心
You were the voice of conscience.

409
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:44,330
我反复思量
I've given this a great deal of thought.

410
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:47,830
我...
I've...

411
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:50,500
我想还你个人情
I'm willing to return the favor.

412
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:55,670
我很想带你走
I would very much like for you to come with me.

413
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:58,130
你可以照顾你的孩子
You can care for your child,

414
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,870
我们照看你们俩
And I will care for the both of you.

415
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:03,730
我宁愿死
I would rather die.

416
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,270
我保证
I promise...

417
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:13,030
我不会伤害你们的
I will not harm either of you.

418
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,000
泰勒
Teyla...

419
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:18,700
你得相信我
You have to believe me.

420
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,730
我不会相信一个杀人犯说的话
I can not trust the word of a murderer.

421
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:22,800
你怎么就不开窍
Why can't you understand?

422
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:29,030
我这么做是有苦衷的
I have become what I am out of necessity,

423
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,330
生存所逼
The need to survive!

424
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,500
你这么做是为了复仇
You became what you are out of vengeance.

425
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,370
难道在你的世界  罪人就不该受罚吗
Do you not punish criminals in your world?

426
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:36,070
正义就不能得到伸张吗
Are they not brought to justice?

427
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,630
对你来说这是正义吗
Is this justice to you?

428
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:39,930
杀死银河系数以千计的
Killing hundreds of thousands of innocent people

429
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:41,030
无辜人民
Across this galaxy?

430
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,200
要不是你们要用我来做
They would not be dead

431
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,530
那个邪恶的试验
Had you not made me the subject

432
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:45,330
他们就不会死
Of your vicious experiment!

433
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:47,530
你的双手沾满他们的鲜血
Their blood is on your hands!

434
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:55,770
你自己选
It's your choice.

435
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:58,800
跟我走生存下去  或者留下来等死
You can come with me and live, or remain here and die.

436
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,030
无论如何  我都要带走你的孩子
Either way, I'm taking your child.

437
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,730
我们得炸掉飞船
We need to blow up the jumper.

438
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:13,600
如果我们炸了它
If we blow it up,

439
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,400
切断了电源  就停止了力场
We cut the power and disable the force field,

440
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,830
对吧
Right?

441
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,870
好计划  我只是不确定
Great plan-- I'm just not entirely clear

442
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:20,930
你究竟要怎么炸毁那艘飞船
On how you intend on doing the actual blowing up.

443
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:21,770
用远程遥控飞船去撞
Fire a drone at it.

444
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:22,900
不行
We can't.

445
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,670
备用电池提供的能量
The chair room requires far more power

446
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:26,330
无法支撑主室的能量消耗
Than the auxiliary battery units can provide.

447
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:28,570
我勉强能调足够的能量到这实验室
I was barely able to bring enough power into this lab,

448
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:29,500
更别提还要支撑几个
Let alone the few transporters

449
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,800
刚修好的传输机
I could bring online.

450
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,200
好的  那就用飞船
All right, then, we'll take a jumper.

451
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,030
我再一次问  怎么做
Again, I come back to my question of how?

452
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,500
我们去不了飞船舱
We have no way of getting to the jumper bay.

453
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,600
那我们就去水下基地找一架
We'll take one from the underwater bay.

454
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,700
飞到塔楼上
Fly it up to the tower,

455
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,270
然后扔个飞弹出去
Fire a drone through the window,

456
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:43,130
炸掉迈克尔的飞船
And take out michael's jumper.

457
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,370
怎么了
What?

458
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,800
没  没  听着挺好的
Uh, no, no, no, that's a good plan,

459
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,500
除了一个小问题
Except I see one small problem--

460
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,430
水下停泊舱
The underwater jumper bay

461
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:51,770
只有几架飞船
Only has a couple of jumpers in it.

462
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:53,070
我们只要一架啊
Well, we only need one.

463
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,730
问题是
Yes, well, the thing is--

464
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:55,730
大多都因长期泡水
Both of them were severely damaged

465
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:56,670
坏得厉害
In the flood.

466
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:58,430
没有哪架还能飞
Neither of them is able to fly.

467
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:00,830
都2年了  瑞迪克  麦凯早修好了
That was two years ago, radek. mckay already fixed them.

468
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,470
不会吧...
Oh, you've got to be kidding me...

469
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:05,770
我正准备修
It was the next thing on my list.

470
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:07,230
你说过你要去修的
You said you were going to fix them.

471
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,870
我知道  我准备要修的  真的
I know, and I was getting to it, I swear.

472
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,300
2年了呢
And you had two years!

473
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,830
我忙的很
I was busy!

474
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,030
或许我们应该下去看看
Perhaps we should go

475
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,200
还能不能修个一两架
And see if we can fix one of them.

476
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,570
好主意
That's a good idea,

477
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:16,830
但你给我留在这儿
But I want you stay here

478
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:18,200
想办法切断迈克尔的锁定
To try to override michael's lockouts.

479
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,800
为什么我不能留下做这个
Why don't I stay here and work on that?

480
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,970
泽兰卡可以和你去修飞船
Zelenka can go with you to the jumper bay.

481
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:22,600
因为你一定要去
Because I want you to come with me

482
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,000
修飞船
And fix those jumpers

483
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,370
你2年前说过
Like you said you were going to do

484
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:26,370
你要去修的
Two years ago.

485
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:27,430
走吧
Let's go.

486
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,100
希望有传输机送我们去
Please tell me there's a transporter.

487
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,300
有的
Yes.

488
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,330
不过  离舱远的很
Well, not by the jumper bay,

489
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:31,970
两层下面有一个传输机
But there's one two levels down.

490
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:34,530
太好了
That'll do.

491
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:43,570
干得好
Nice.

492
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,130
你会打?
You can fight.

493
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:13,030
打过5年拳击
Five years of kick-boxing.

494
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,930
这消息不错
That's good to know.

495
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:17,100
发生了什么事
What happened?

496
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,730
是迈克尔和他的变种人
It's Michael and his hybrids.

497
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:00,970
我数出三个
I counted three of 'em.

498
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:01,970
不知道后面是不是还有更多的
I'm not sure how many more there are.

499
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:03,170
估计不会太多
Probably not too many--

500
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:04,330
毕竟是乘飞船过来
They all had to fit in that jumper.

501
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:07,670
除非他们走过来
Unless more came through on foot afterward.

502
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:09,670
我们怎么办
What do we do?

503
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:10,800
先想办法去武器库
Try to get to the armory,

504
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,530
然后回来夺回星门室
come back and retake the gate room.

505
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:13,670
听起来计划不错
Sounds like a plan.

506
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:14,670
你们两个  跟我们来
You two, come with us.

507
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:17,270
你就和他们呆一起  安抚下他们
Stay here with them, keep all of them calm

508
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,730
如果还有变种人出现
And, uh, if any more hybrids show up,

509
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:21,600
就像刚刚那样做
just do what you did earlier.

510
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,230
再跟你说一遍  这很紧急
...speak with you again. It's urgent.

511
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:32,330
和他待一起
Stay with him.

512
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,870
怎么了
What is it?

513
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:40,170
我们终于破译了
We were finally able to

514
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:42,900
自毁装置的密码
decipher the encryption on the self-destruct device.

515
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,570
很好
Good.

516
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:46,630
准备起飞
Prepare the ship to leave.

517
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:48,470
准备启动自毁装置
We'll arm the self-destruct,

518
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:50,500
然后在我们离开前的瞬间
And switch the power back to Atlantis' systems

519
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,930
把电源切回到亚特兰蒂斯的系统
a split-second before we leave.

520
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:54,700
时机一定要精准
The timing of the switch must be precise.

521
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,100
我不想他们有任何机会
I don't want to give them any opportunity

522
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,700
解除装置
to disarm the device.

523
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,600
我会计算好的
I'll make the calculations.

524
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,170
计划有变
Change of plans.

525
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,170
我们不去武器库了
We're not going to the armory.

526
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:07,370
为什么  发生什么事了
Why? What happened?

527
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:09,300
他们启动了自毁装置
They armed the self-destruct.

528
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,230
伍尔希先生  能否请你回到其他人那里
Mr. Woolsey, would you please head back to the others?

529
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,630
谢帕德中校  我是泰勒
Colonel Sheppard, this is Teyla.

530
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:31,400
能听得到吗
Can you hear me?

531
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,630
约翰  我是泰勒  请回话
John, this is Teyla. Please respond.

532
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:51,800
谢帕...
Colonel Shep--

533
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,800
谢帕德中校
Colonel Sheppard.

534
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,300
若楠在控制室
Ronon is in the control room.

535
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,370
正和迈克尔打着呢
He's fighting with Michael!

536
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:58,530
我们快到飞船舱了  有情况随时通报
We're almost at the jumper bay. Keep us posted.

537
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:12,070
泰勒  快跑
Teyla, run!

538
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:25,600
泰勒
Teyla!

539
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,430
你还好吗
Are you all right?

540
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:27,470
还好
Yes.

541
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:28,270
但是若楠需要帮忙
But Ronon needs our help.

542
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:29,970
我们必须尽快回到控制室
We need to get back up to the control room.

543
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:58,830
瑞迪克?  那里发生了什么事
Radek? Tell us what's going on up there.

544
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:00,930
我说不好  若楠倒下了
I-- I can't tell. Ronon is down.

545
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:03,130
可能昏过去了
He might just be unconscious.

546
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:05,370
他醒过来了就告诉我
Tell me when he comes to.

547
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:06,300
我们进展怎么样
What have we got?

548
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,970
就像我说的  两个飞船都坏了
It's like I said--both of the jumpers are toast.

549
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:09,130
这个有一大堆的问题
This one's got a whole whack of problems,

550
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:10,600
首先就是没有能源
starting with zero power.

551
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,730
你的意思是说另外一个有能源的对不对
You said the other jumper's got power, right?

552
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:13,600
对  不过好不了多少
Yeah, but not much else.

553
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,430
驾驶舱不能用  也没有飞弹
Drive pods won't extend, there's no drones...

554
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:16,630
可是这艘有飞弹
This one's got drones.

555
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:17,970
如果我们把能源弄过来
So if we bring power over to this,

556
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,470
这样驾驶舱就可以用了  对吧
We can get drive pods working, right?

557
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:21,000
你想让我把两个船上能用的部件
You want me to harvest parts from both jumpers,

558
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,570
就这么拼成一个可以用的飞船?
Cobble together a fix so one of them will work?

559
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:23,530
可行吗
Is it possible?

560
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:24,270
我怀疑
Doubtful.

561
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,170
但也是有可能的...
But maybe...

562
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:26,270
怎么说都有很多工作
A long shot at best.

563
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,670
很好  开始吧
Perfect. Get to it.

564
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:28,930
要多久  15分钟?
What do you need, 15 minutes?

565
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:36,270
真好  真是好极了
Great, just great.

566
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:43,230
传输机也被关了
Must've locked out the transporters.

567
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,370
我们要去控制室
We need to get to the control room.

568
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:45,470
这太危险了  没有武器就不能去
It's too dangerous.Not without weapons.

569
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:47,170
最近的楼梯在哪里
Where's the nearest stairwell?

570
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:49,070
转角那儿  这边
Around the corner. This way.

571
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:51,100
我走前面
Let me lead.

572
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:39,430
好了  输好了
Okay, give 'er.

573
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:42,030
驾驶舱可以用了
Drive pods are go.

574
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,570
好了  我们差不多了
All right, now we're getting somewhere.

575
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:47,130
有能源  有生命支持系统  有...
I got juice, I got life support, I got--

576
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:47,930
不是吧
Oh, come on!

577
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:48,670
怎么了
What?

578
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:50,970
武器装置没连上
The weapons won't come online.

579
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:52,130
为什么
Why not?

580
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:53,170
我不知道
I don't know.

581
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:55,570
那就找原因  我们需要飞弹
Well, figure it out. we need those drones.

582
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,500
她在哪里
Where is she?

583
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,170
我们不知道
We don't know.

584
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:07,330
我们都找遍了
We searched everywhere.

585
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:09,570
你是想说她就这样消失了吗
Are you telling me she just disappeared?

586
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:12,600
我是说我们找遍了几乎
I'm saying that we searched every room and corridor

587
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,830
每个房间和走道
Within the stun field.

588
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:16,170
哪儿都找不到
We couldn't find her anywhere.

589
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:18,200
她对这个城市很了解
She knows this city well.

590
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,230
一定是躲在哪里了
She's hiding somewhere.

591
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,570
她在和我玩
She's toying with me!

592
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:24,930
我们会继续找的
We'll keep looking.

593
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:26,800
不用了  我来处理
No. I'll handle this.

594
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,870
你要怎么做
What are you going to do?

595
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,600
把她逼出来
Flush her out.

596
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:39,270
是亚特兰蒂斯的自毁系统
That's Atlantis' self-destruct.

597
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,070
迈克尔要炸了这个城市
Michael's going to blow up the city.

598
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,030
我们有多少时间
How much time do we have?

599
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,530
他设置为10分钟
He set it for 10 minutes.

600
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:44,500
那你要多久
How much time do you need

601
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,500
能把飞弹弄好
before you get those drones working?

602
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,400
如果真能弄好
If I can get them working at all,

603
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,570
10分钟也不够啊
A lot more than 10 minutes!

604
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:49,670
好吧  那就别理它了
All right, forget about it.

605
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:51,100
你  你干什么
What are you-- what are you doing?

606
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,200
开飞船去撞塔楼
Gonna fly the jumper and crash it into the tower.

607
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,070
撞上去?
Crash it?

608
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:56,100
这是最好的逼出迈克尔的方法
It's our best chance of taking out Michael's jumper.

609
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,630
可也把自己也搭进去了
Not to mention taking out yourself.

610
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:00,500
我以前开飞船撞过塔楼
I have crashed jumpers into the tower before.

611
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,130
像这样的可没有
Not like this you haven't.

612
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:03,400
除了没有武器
Look, in addition to the weapons,

613
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,800
还有惯性的问题
The inertial dampeners are out.

614
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,100
为了给迈克尔的飞船
You'll need to impact michael's jumper

615
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,000
造成足够的破坏
with enough force to do some serious damage,

616
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,400
你撞上去的速度必须非常快
which means a lot of speed when you hit that tower.

617
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,530
这根本就是自杀行为
Look, this is a suicide mission.

618
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,470
泰勒
Teyla...

619
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:22,770
我知道你听得到我
I know you can hear me.

620
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:24,930
这个警报声  如果你不清楚的话
That alarm, if you're not aware,

621
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:27,370
是亚特兰蒂斯的自毁装置
is Atlantis' self-destruct device.

622
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:30,270
我已经启动了  设为10分钟
I've armed it, set it for 10 minutes.

623
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:31,570
也就是说你有10分钟的时间
That is the amount of time you have

624
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:34,330
来考虑我提出的建议
to consider the offer I'm about to make.

625
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:37,770
如果你能交出自己和孩子
If you will surrender yourself and your child to me,

626
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,370
我就关闭装置
I'll disarm the device,

627
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:41,930
饶了这个基地上的人一命
sparing the lives of everyone on this base.

628
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:45,130
如果不的话...你  你的孩子
If not... you, your baby,

629
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:49,530
所有人都要死
And everyone else will die.

630
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,870
好了  你可以走了
Okay, you're good to go.

631
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:00,200
确保塔楼塌下来的时候
Make sure that strike team is ready to move

632
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,070
突击队准备好出发了
as soon as that field drops.

633
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:02,030
我会的
I will.

634
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:03,100
出舱的时候
Don't accelerate too fast

635
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,300
不要加速的太快
coming out of the jumper bay.

636
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,530
如果太快
If you hit the gas too hard,

637
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:06,700
你会像煎饼一样扁的
you're going to flatten like a pancake.

638
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,430
好的
Right.

639
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,100
怎么了
What?

640
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,970
只是...
Well, it's just...

641
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:16,230
你现在做的...
What you're about to do is...

642
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:17,870
又不是第一次了
Yeah. It's not like it's the first time.

643
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:19,900
我做过几次这种自杀任务了
How many suicide missions have I flown?

644
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:20,630
我不知道  数不清了都
I don't know. I lost count.

645
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:22,470
好了  出发了
Well, there you go.

646
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:25,770
好吧
All right, well, you know...

647
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:26,870
希望还有更多
Here's to many more.

648
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:32,370
罗德尼?
Rodney?

649
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:35,600
瑞迪克  啥事
Yeah, radek. go ahead.

650
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,330
我终于知道
I've finally figured out

651
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,100
该怎么绕过迈克尔的封闭指令了
How to override some of michael's lockout codes.

652
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,400
太棒了
That's great.

653
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,700
那能把自毁装置关了么
Can you shut down the self-destruct?

654
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:43,030
还不行  这个还需要点时间
No. no, no, that will take a little bit more time.

655
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:45,970
不过  我知道怎么去星门室了
I have, however, managed to get the access doors to the gate room open.

656
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:48,300
这个  并不是什么好事啊
Well, that does us absolutely no good.

657
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,000
力场仍然在工作中诶
I mean, the stun field is still in effect.

658
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,330
那星门室那一层的传输器呢
What about the transporter on the gate room level?

659
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:53,700
还不行
Uh... no, no,

660
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,870
那个也没办法控制
I still don't have control of that, either.

661
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:57,000
真服了你了
For crying out loud--

662
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,730
拜托  我已经尽力了
I'm sorry, I'm doing the best I can.

663
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:00,730
迈克尔设置了许多高级密码
Michael has placed several highly encrypted codes--

664
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:02,300
那这样吧
Look, just--

665
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,600
防护盾呢  能不能降下来一些
What about the gate shield? can you lower it?

666
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,430
这个行
Yes. that I can do.

667
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:07,100
太好了
Great.

668
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,770
你也不用玩什么敢死队了
You don't have to do your kamikaze run.

669
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:11,030
怎么了
Why not?

670
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,570
直接飞向塔楼  尽量靠近
Just fly to the tower, get in proximity,

671
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:14,870
然后随便向哪个星球呼叫下
Dial the dhd to a random planet,

672
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:16,370
然后再让瑞迪克把防护盾降下来一些
We'll have radek lower the gate shield,

673
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:17,500
直接制造个漩涡
Allowing the vortex

674
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,530
把迈克尔的飞船给冲出来
To obliterate michael's puddle jumper...

675
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:19,530
或者逼出个大部分也行
Or most of it.

676
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,100
这主意倒是不错
Now, that's a good plan.

677
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:23,530
你去哪
Where are you going?

678
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:25,000
你来驾驶飞船
You're gonna fly it.

679
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,930
我就能去带领突击队
That frees me up to lead the strike team.

680
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:28,800
听你说的  很简单了
You said it yourself-- it's simple enough.

681
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,930
只要拨号就可以了
You just dial the gate.

682
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:30,970
这个我能行
I guess I can do that.

683
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:33,030
要小心加速器
Go easy on the accelerator.

684
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:36,600
瑞迪克  准备好听我的指示
Radek, get ready to drop that shield on my mark.

685
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,870
对对...
Right...

686
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,030
我们没多少时间了
We don't have much time.

687
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,400
得赶紧离开这里
We need to leave this place.

688
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:50,600
时间有限  泰勒
Time is short, teyla.

689
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,600
我不明白
I don't understand--

690
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,630
这选择又不难
I would think the choice is an easy one...

691
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:57,970
想想你的孩子
If nothing else, consider your child.

692
00:33:57,970 --> 00:33:59,600
你就一直这么藏着
By remaining in hiding,

693
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,570
就相当于判了他死刑
You are sentencing him to die.

694
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:03,800
有哪个母亲会做这种事
What kind of mother would do such a thing?

695
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:08,470
他有机会活下去的
He has a chance to live.

696
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:10,930
你们俩都有
Both of you do.

697
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:13,570
跟我来吧  泰勒
Come with me, teyla.

698
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:15,730
相信我
Trust me--

699
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:17,730
我不会伤害你们的
I will not harm either of you.

700
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:20,730
我也不会伤害亚特兰蒂斯
And I will not harm atlantis.

701
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:22,400
我向你保证
You have my word.

702
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:29,600
关掉自毁装置
Turn off the self-destruct system.

703
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,730
泰勒?
Teyla?

704
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:33,430
你希望我相信你么
You want me to trust you?

705
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:34,930
那就证明给我看
Then show me you mean what you say.

706
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,700
关掉自毁装置
Turn off the self-destruct system,

707
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,400
我就跟你走
And I will come with you.

708
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:00,400
我现在已经升空
All right, I'm in the air...

709
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,430
向中心塔楼飞去
Approaching the central tower.

710
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:02,370
收到
Copy that.

711
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:03,370
泽兰卡  你准备好了吗
Zelenka, you ready?

712
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:04,870
随时待命
Ready when you are.

713
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:08,730
迈克尔  你听到我说的话了吗
Michael, can you hear me?

714
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:10,900
只剩不到2分钟
Less than two minutes.

715
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,030
我们得走了  马上
We need to go. now.

716
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:15,670
是的  泰勒
Yes, teyla.

717
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:17,300
我听见了
I hear you.

718
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,370
你真让我失望
You disappoint me.

719
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,230
我不会阻止你走你自己选择的路
So I will leave you to the fate you have chosen.

720
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:27,270
但是我也不会空手而归
But I'm not leaving alone.

721
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:27,970
你应该知道
You should know

722
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:31,030
我已经采集了你儿子的DNA
That I've already collected your son's dna...

723
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:33,400
重新克隆一个虽然需要更多时间
Cloning him will require additional time,

724
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,730
耽误我的计划
Delaying the implementation of my plan,

725
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:40,000
但是你知道的  我不会退缩的
But as you well know, I will not be deterred.

726
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,870
再见  泰勒
Good-bye, teyla.

727
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:04,900
你在干吗
What are you doing?

728
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,300
收集最后一份战果
Collecting one last prize.

729
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,900
就位  准备拨号
I'm in position. ready to dial.

730
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,700
瑞迪克  降下防护盾
Radek, drop the shield.

731
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:25,300
防护盾降下来了  罗德尼  出发
The shield's down! go, rodney!

732
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:31,370
不!
No!

733
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:01,030
力场在慢慢减弱了
The stun field is neutralized!

734
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:02,630
那自毁装置呢  破坏掉了没
What about the self-destruct? is it disabled?

735
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,600
是的  飞船能源一关闭  它就停了
Yes, yes. it shut off when the jumper's power was cut.

736
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,930
好的  那我现在掉头回去了
Good. I'm heading back.

737
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:08,170
你继续恢复城市能源
Go ahead and reboot the city's power.

738
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:09,530
正在处理中了
Yes, I'm already doing it.

739
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:39,300
去找个医生
Get a medic!

740
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:44,530
瑞迪克  关掉舱门
Close the jumper bay doors, radek!

741
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:48,370
艾米丽亚
Amelia...

742
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:51,430
帮我照看下图门行么
Will you take care of torren for me?

743
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:53,830
好的
Of course.

744
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:56,270
不要让任何人离开
Make sure no one leaves.

745
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,930
泰勒
Ah! teyla!

746
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,930
我们凯勒的小调皮病号感觉如何?
How's dr. keller's most cantankerous patient?

747
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:44,500
你在开玩笑呢吧
You've got to be kidding me.

748
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,230
你能出院了
You get released,

749
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,230
而我还要再待一天么
And I gotta stay here another day?

750
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:48,730
因为我只是滚了几级台阶而已
Because I only fell down a flight of stairs.

751
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:51,130
而你  我的朋友  可是被人从楼上推了下来
You, my friend, were hurled from a much greater height.

752
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:53,200
只有个脑震荡  算是你运气好了
You're lucky you only suffered a concussion

753
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,200
没把脖子摔断了
And didn't break your neck.

754
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,130
没什么  我很好
Nothing. I'm fine.

755
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:57,500
我知道你好
I know you are.

756
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,730
不过还是要听医生的话
But listen to the doctor.

757
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:02,400
不过呢  我主要是想来
Anyway, I just wanted to drop by

758
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,300
表扬一下你的模范作用
And commend you for your exemplary work.

759
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,370
你的临危不惧
Your courage in the face of danger

760
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:09,870
始终能让我惊讶
Continues to amaze

761
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:12,930
或者容我说  让我敬佩
And, dare I say, inspire me.

762
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:17,370
多谢夸奖
Thanks.

763
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:19,970
好好休息
Get some rest.

764
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:21,100
不要担心
And don't worry.

765
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,900
你的队员会等你康复的
Your team's not going anywhere without you.

766
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,430
这倒提醒我了
That reminds me.

767
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:27,370
我知道  这次迈克尔对亚城的攻击
I know michael attacking the city

768
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:28,700
并不算什么正式的任务
Isn't really a mission,

769
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:31,770
不过我还是弄了份报告
But, uh, I filed a report anyways.

770
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:35,700
非常好
Splendid.

771
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,230

772

迈克尔入侵亚特兰蒂斯

774
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:46,900
试图炸毁它
Tried to blow it up.

775
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,700
我们阻止了他

776
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,900
报告完毕
End of report.

777
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,300
长远来看
Take a good long look,

778
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,470
你肯定是只能咬着我的车尾巴啦
'cause soon you're going to see nothing but taillights.

779
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:01,400
好办法  赛车手
Nice try, speed racer.

780
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:10,170
对不起啊
I'm sorry.

781
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:11,800
对不起啦  我们只是...
Sorry, we were just, you know...

782
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,630
谁赢了
Who's winning?

783
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,230
我
I am.

784
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:15,700
疝气还没好呢?
Still colicky, huh?

785
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,770
他都一天没睡了
He was awake all day.

786
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:18,130
也总是睡不着
Refused to take a nap.

787
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:19,270
这很正常啊
That's not surprising.

788
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:20,570
晚上不是都在睡了么
He got a full night's sleep.

789
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:21,930
是啊  这很让我惊讶的
Yes, it's remarkable.

790
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:23,470
他从头到尾都在睡着
He slept through the entire ordeal.

791
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:25,630
他从来没有这样整夜睡下来过
He hasn't slept through a whole night in...

792
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:27,800
从来没有
Ever.

793
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,230
以后可以睡安稳咯
Well, he can rest easy now,

794
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:30,930
既然迈克尔已经就这样消失在历史版图中
'cause michael's finally out of the picture.

795
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:33,530
可是以后肯定还会有第二个迈克尔
Unfortunately, there will be somebody else to take his place.

796
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:34,870
我敢肯定
Of this, I am certain.

797
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:36,600
他有个超级妈妈的
He's got super mom watching his back.

798
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,530
要说我  没事的
If you ask me, he's in good hands.

799
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:41,430
图门  想看看我
Torren, do you want to watch me

800
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:42,870
是怎么打败罗德尼的么
Kick rodney's ass?

801
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,430
帮忙遮下宝宝的眼睛
Actually, you may want to cover the child's eyes,

802
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:47,430
因为他会输得很难看的哦
Because this could get ugly.

803
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:49,330
准备好了吗
Are you ready?

804
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:50,270
当然
Yeah.

805
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:51,370
一  二
One... two--
