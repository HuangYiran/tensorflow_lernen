108
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:24,951
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then let's go plundering!

109

110
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:36,633
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Land ho!

111
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,933
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Blood Island.

112
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:43,499
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So-called because it's the exact shape of some blood.

113
00:07:55,499 --> 00:07:56,499


114
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:36,681
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me. Mind out.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

118
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,091
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One Pirate of the Year entry form, if you please.

119
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:45,029
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

120
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,697

125
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:53,302
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shanties.

126
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,936
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I shall put "Rousing."

127
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,236
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Beard"?

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Luxuriant.

129
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,913
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Obviously.

130
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:01,184
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you think I should sign it in blood?

131
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,617
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Make it more dramatic?

132
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:04,985
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Might be a bit on the showy side.

133
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bit too much. You might be right.

134
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:10,255
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pirate Captain.

135
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,219

136
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:14,355
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd bet my face.

137
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,831
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, thank you, Albino Pirate.

00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,128
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're a shoo-in, sir.

139
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:19,726
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sure, there's not a pirate on the seven seas can match you.

140
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:27,978
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lock up your daughters!

00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:33,108
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's me, Peg-Leg Hastings!

142
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:35,618
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Back from plunderin' the Spanish Main.

143
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:36,949
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good grief.

144
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:41,924
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I reckon this will make me Pirate of the Year.

145
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:48,828
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry, sir. He's all flash and no bang.

00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,334
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're probably all wondering

150
00:10:10,335 --> 00:10:13,154
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if I'm still as deadly as I am beautiful.

151
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,223
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I am.

168
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:13,938
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perhaps we should be off, sir.

169
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:15,034
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

170
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:18,381

176
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:44,402
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello, Bellamy. Cutlass. Peg-Leg.

00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:45,669

00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:59,285
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bring it down a little bit. All right.

183
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:00,346
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Seriously, Captain,

184
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:02,455
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}how's the pirating business treating you?

185
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:05,257
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, yeah, brilliantly, brilliantly. Thanks for asking.

186
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:07,126
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Treasure coming out of my eyeballs.

187
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,495
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Taken to washing my hair in 50-pound notes.

188
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:10,959
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really?

189
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:13,162
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you've got so much booty,

190
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:16,365
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then how come you're still sailing that old wreck?

191
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,873
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anyway, look, I'd love to stay and chat, but, you know,

192
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:26,745
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}places to pillage, people to... People to skewer.

193
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,789
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on!

194
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:35,257
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is disgusting.

195
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,056
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait a minute.

196
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,557
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Captain, what is this?

197
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,656
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What? - Captain?

198
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:44,758
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's nothing. Could I possibly have that back?

199
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,235
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hold on, hold on. Wait, wait. - Thank you.

200
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:47,327
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Pirate of the Year"?

201
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,836
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're entering Pirate of the Year?

202
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:53,035
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no, no, no.

203
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:56,646
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yes. - Again?

204
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:58,404
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes!

205
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:02,709
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. Listen, did they change the rules?

206
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,075
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, I always thought

207
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:06,621
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they gave it to the pirate with the most booty.

208
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,421
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do they now just give it to the guy with the fattest parrot?

209
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:11,961
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She is not fat. She's just big-boned.

210
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:14,227
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's fat, dude.

211
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:15,731
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, go on. Go on, then, laugh.

212
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:17,199
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everyone laugh.

213
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:27,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ignore them, Captain. It's not worth it.

214
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:29,637
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The trophy would just clash with your wallpaper, anyway.

215
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,912
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll see, you'll see.

216
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:42,619
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I will be Pirate of the Year.

217
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:44,092
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

218
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:49,129
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then you'll be laughing on the other side of your faces.

219
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:52,593
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

220
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:56,504
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And believe me, that is a very painful thing to do.

221
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:57,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, lads.

222
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:06,615
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well...

223
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:13,343
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, now listen up, you coves.

224
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:16,422
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll show those swabs a thing or two about pirating.

225
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:21,861
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's still time to fill these chests with sparkling booty.

226
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:24,861
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can practically taste that trophy!

227
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:27,628
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Trophy! Trophy! Trophy!

228
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:34,809
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Captain! Sail off the port bow!

229
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:37,208
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's get after her, Number Two.

230
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,714
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aye, aye, sir.

231
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:40,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Clap on all sail!

232
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:42,549
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Royals and topgallants!

233
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,609
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Release those gallants!

234
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:08,739
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fire those long things that go bang.

235
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,907
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fire cannons four and six!

236
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:20,718
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eat cannonball, lubbers.

237
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:28,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here we go, lads! Look and learn.

238
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:32,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go get 'em, Pirate Captain!

239
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:36,506
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Avast! I'm the Pirate Captain.

240
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,139
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I'm here for your gold.

241
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:41,552
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gold? This is a plague boat, old man.

242
00:16:41,553 --> 00:16:43,873
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd give my right arm for some gold.

243
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,506
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or my left.

244
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:48,073
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right, lads.

245
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,778
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Minor hiccup, that last one.

246
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:50,843
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This time,

247
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,387
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it's payday!

248
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:58,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm the Pirate Captain, and I'm here for your gold.

249
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,656
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Geography field trip.

250
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,367
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm the Pirate Captain, and...

251
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:07,968
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Naturists.

252
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:12,598
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pirate Captain. Blah, blah, blah, blah, gold.

253
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:14,041
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ghost ship.

254
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:21,917
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry.

255
00:17:53,517 --> 00:17:54,917


256
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:06,721
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Captain, we've sighted another ship, sir.

257
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,392
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's nice.

258
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:16,996
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you want to give the order to attack?

259
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:19,941
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, not really, Number Two. No, I think I've...

260
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,604
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Think I had enough of piracy.

261
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:24,011
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm hanging up my cutlass.

262
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:26,311
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Captain, no!

263
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:29,045
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I was thinking I might go into baby clothes, actually.

264
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:30,311
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

265
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:33,379
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hear there's a fortune to be made in baby clothes

266
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,049
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because babies grow so fast.

267
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,685
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, but you can't. I mean, the crew...

268
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:39,456
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They'd... they'd be lost without you.

269
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:41,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What was I thinking, Number Two?

270
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:43,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pirate of the Year?

271
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:44,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Me?

272
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:45,934
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at the trophy cabinet.

273

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pirate of the Year?

00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:00,239
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just commercialized nonsense.

00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,919
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Real piracy isn't about trophies.

279

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's about fighting up staircases backwards.

00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,825
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And think about all the adventures we've had.

283

00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:35,946
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the running people through.

00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,997
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're more of a pirate than Black Bellamy or any of them.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you say?

303
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,342
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}By Neptune, where's that ship?

00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:04,797
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll never get a girlfriend. I am so unhappy.

317
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:23,186
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And now I'm being attacked by pirates.

318
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:40,972
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Avast! I'm the Pirate Captain, and I'm here for your gold.

319
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:43,872
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I haven't got any gold.

320
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:45,872
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No gold, eh?

321
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:48,383
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then what, might I ask, is this?

322
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:50,443
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a baboon's kidney.

323
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:52,181
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is it?

324
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:55,355
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And what about this?

325
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:57,485
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's another baboon's kidney.

326
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:01,356
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We searched the hold, Captain.

327
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And?

328
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,634
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just creatures.

329
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,637
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bits of creatures in jars.

330
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:10,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And an unhappy-looking baboon.

331
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:14,934
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What kind of ship is this?

332
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,579
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're a...

333
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:21,413
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, we were a scientific expedition.

334
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:23,612
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Charles Darwin, at your service, sir.

335
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:26,747
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For pity's sake!

336
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:29,554
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is it so much to ask? Is it?

337
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:33,223
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just want one tiny bit of success!

338
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:37,028
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One teensy weensy bit of respect from my peers

339
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:38,625
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}just once in my life!

340
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:41,236
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that such a crime?

341
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:42,738
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is it?

342
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,905
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No? - No!

343
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:48,501
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

344
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:50,604
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you try telling that to the universe.

345
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:53,673
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just once, just once for things to go right.

346
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:54,979
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just... just once.

347
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:02,119
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, are we done here?

348
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,629
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dear Diary,

349
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:10,826
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}about to meet a watery grave.

350
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,883
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's nothing personal, you understand.

351
00:23:12,883 --> 00:23:15,131
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just... It's been a tough week,

352
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:17,969
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and a good plank walk usually cheers him up.

353
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:22,073
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will die without reaching second base with a lady.

354
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:24,645
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get on with it!

355
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:28,076
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Today's weather:

356
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:29,844
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}inclement.

357
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:38,992
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Stop! - Now what?

358
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,394
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Last request, is it? Do we have to grant those?

359
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:44,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is there some sort of human rights convention we're signed up to?

360
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:46,332
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- But that bird! - My parrot?

361
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:47,868
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's just big-boned!

362
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,873
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, she's not. I mean... I mean, she's not a parrot.

363
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,306
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not a parrot?

364
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:53,775
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's he on about, old girl?

365
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:54,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's... she's...

366
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:57,842
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's the scientific discovery of our age!

367
00:23:57,969 --> 00:23:59,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's a...

368
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:02,787
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry.

369
00:24:02,788 --> 00:24:04,547
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just,

370
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,646
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that's my favorite bit.

371
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:13,822
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A dodo, you say?

372
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:16,661
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They've been extinct for 150 years.

373
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:19,964
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To find one alive today, it's quite incredible.

374
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:23,062
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, clever old girl. Not going extinct.

375
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:24,282
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I might be so bold,

376
00:24:24,283 --> 00:24:29,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I would be prepared to pay you 10 pounds for your Polly.

377
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:31,972
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Polly's not for sale.

378
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:33,516
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ten pound.

379
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:34,744
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's one of the family.

380
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,513
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's like an auntie.

381
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:37,815
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With a beak.

382
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:39,116
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I'm afraid they're right, Charles.

383
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:42,021
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Polly here is the feathery heart and soul of the boat.

384
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, little dodo.

385
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:49,359
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's such a missed opportunity.

386
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:51,226
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I could've presented her

387
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:54,896
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in London to the Royal Society at their annual science show...

388
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,837
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No question of that, I'm afraid.

389
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:58,292
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She'd have been an absolute sensation.

390
00:24:58,293 --> 00:24:59,561
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, well, can't be helped.

391
00:24:59,561 --> 00:25:01,968
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And of course a shoo-in for the top prize.

392
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:05,478
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Prize?

393
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:08,541
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For best scientific discovery. Yes.

394
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:12,581
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This prize,

395
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:13,561
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}valuable, is it?

396
00:25:13,562 --> 00:25:14,709
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Valuable?

397
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:18,494
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's priceless.

398
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,757
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Untold riches.

399
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:25,864
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Captain... - No, no, no, no.

400
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:28,666
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was thinking, perhaps, perhaps I was being a touch hasty.

401
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:29,831
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, Captain, London?

402
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:31,374
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The home of Queen Victoria,

403
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:33,542
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}mortal enemy of pirates everywhere?

404
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:35,873
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll end up hanged at Execution Dock.

405
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:39,823
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We laugh in the face of danger, remember?

406
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:43,409
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I don't. - I don't really like danger at all.

407
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:48,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Captain, do you remember the little talk we had?

408
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:51,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The one about whether pigs are actually a type of fruit?

409
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:53,852
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

410
00:25:57,822 --> 00:25:58,857
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

411
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:01,336
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The one about us trying to avoid harebrained schemes

412
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:02,929
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that end in us facing certain death.

413
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:04,837
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You heard the man, Number Two.

414
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,773
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Untold riches."

415
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:07,866
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here's the plan.

416
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,096
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We go to London,

417
00:26:09,097 --> 00:26:11,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Polly wins this science show thingy,

418
00:26:11,636 --> 00:26:12,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we take the prize money,

419
00:26:12,781 --> 00:26:15,641
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I enter Pirate of the Year, I win!

420
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:17,118
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bingo!

421
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:18,414
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But... but Captain, I'm not sure...

422
00:26:18,415 --> 00:26:19,177
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It can't fail.

423
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:22,817
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And besides, look at her little face.

424
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:25,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I sure want to win that science prize.

425
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:28,691
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bravo, Captain!

426
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:32,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I see you're a man of vision!

427
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:34,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right, then, Charles.

428
00:26:34,481 --> 00:26:36,565
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When is this science show of yours?

429
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:38,335
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A week tomorrow.

430
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:39,841
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Confound it!

431
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,808
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see, we could've made that with a good wind behind us,

432
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:42,394
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but unfortunately

433
00:26:42,395 --> 00:26:44,507
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}there's this dirty great sea monster in the way.

434
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:51,453
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think they just add those onto maps for decoration, Captain.

435
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:56,087
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that a fact?

436
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:57,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, blow me down.

437
00:26:58,883 --> 00:26:59,675
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I dare, you could learn

438
00:26:59,676 --> 00:27:00,718
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}something from this fine fellow,

439
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:01,193
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Number Two.

440
00:27:05,051 --> 00:27:08,026
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}London calling to the faraway towns

441
00:27:08,499 --> 00:27:11,601
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now that war is declared-and battle come down

442
00:27:12,267 --> 00:27:15,162
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}London calling to the underworld

443
00:27:15,682 --> 00:27:18,888
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come out of the cupboard, all you boys and girls

444
00:27:19,352 --> 00:27:22,546
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}London calling, see we ain't got no high

445
00:27:23,176 --> 00:27:26,223
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Except for that one with the yellowy eyes

446
00:27:33,178 --> 00:27:35,808
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}London calling, yes, I was there, too

447
00:27:36,431 --> 00:27:39,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}An' you know what they said well, some of it was true

448
00:27:40,162 --> 00:27:42,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}London calling at the top of the dial

449
00:27:43,643 --> 00:27:46,298
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After all this, won't you give me a smile

450
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:47,636
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}London Town.

451
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The most romantic city in the world.

452
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:08,924
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Queen Victoria.

453
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:12,328
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Welcomes you to London.

454
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,801
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's nice.

455
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,701
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perhaps she's not so bad after all.

456
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:19,000


457
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:23,936
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, don't look so worried, Number Two.

458
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:25,777
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pirates are always visiting London.

459
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:29,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Turn back!

460
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:33,545
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the fate of pirates here!

461
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,419
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that Scarlett Morgan?

462
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,088
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pirate Captain.

463
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:39,526
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Goodness me!

464
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:42,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I haven't seen you since that business in Madagascar.

465
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:47,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. I could've sworn they were girls.

466
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:48,665
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're looking well, Morgan.

467
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,471
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, lost a bit of weight.

468
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:52,064
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you up to these days?

469
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, this and that.

470
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:55,767
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, just gonna enter a science competition, actually.

471
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,111
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Good luck with that. - Yeah, thanks, thanks.

472
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:02,814
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, wait, wait!

473
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:04,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Turn back!

474
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:06,748
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Turn back.

475
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:12,016
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Sorry. - No!

476
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:12,997
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look what you've done to me boat.

477
00:29:12,998 --> 00:29:14,256
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at the state of it.

478
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:15,695
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hope you've got some insurance, 'cause I...

479
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,867
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right, then. We'll be off.

480
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll bring her back tomorrow straight after the show.

481
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:23,104
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, don't be daft, Charles. I'll be presenting Polly.

482
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:24,634
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You? - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

483
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:26,835
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I always fancied trying my hand at a spot of science.

484
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:28,403
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you can't.

485
00:29:28,404 --> 00:29:31,406
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, the streets of London are no place for pirates.

486
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:33,608
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pirates? What pirates?

487
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:35,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nobody here but us Girl Guides.

488
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:35,510


489
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:36,677
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes!

490
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:39,749
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've got a badge for looting.

491
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:41,347
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're not really Girl Guides.

492
00:29:41,348 --> 00:29:42,883
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's us, the pirates.

493
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:44,654
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're masters of disguise.

494
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:46,922
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How ingenious.

495
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:50,262
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But all the same, Captain, best we lie low for the night.

496
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:51,732
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perhaps at my house.

497
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,651
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Captain, I really think...

498
00:29:52,652 --> 00:29:53,895
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good plan, Chuck.

499
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,837
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Be fun to see how you boffin types live.

500
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,504
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, come on. Taxi!

501
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:05,139
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Evening, officer.

502
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:07,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hidey-ho, ladies.

503
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:15,917
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}London smells like Grandma.

504
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:26,059
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here we are.

505
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:28,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Home, sweet home.

506
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:35,571
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't get many women back here, do you, Charles?

507
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:39,381
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}People who live alone are always serial killers.

508
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:48,182
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sweet Neptune on a bike!

509
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:48,723


510
00:30:48,723 --> 00:30:49,874


511
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:50,859
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't mind Mr. Bobo.

512
00:30:49,874 --> 00:30:50,459


513
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:53,088
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Just an old project of mine. - Project?

514
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:54,894
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I had this theory.

515
00:30:54,761 --> 00:30:55,691


516
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:56,358
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought that if you took a monkey,

517
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:57,763
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}gave him a monocle

518
00:30:57,822 --> 00:30:59,733
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and covered up his gigantic, unsightly ass,

519
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:02,393
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then he would cease to be a monkey and become more of a...

520
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:05,604
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A man-panzee, if you will.

521
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:06,698
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bold theory.

522
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:08,766
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't like the monkey.

523
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,641
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But to be honest, monkeys are 10 a penny.

524
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,842
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's not a patch on Polly here.

525
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:16,876
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anyhow, big day tomorrow.

526
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:18,146
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We all need our rest.

527
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:21,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me show you to your room, Captain.

528
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,517
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right behind you, Chuck.

529
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,561
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, here's the plan.

530
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:38,083
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what to do.

531
00:31:38,084 --> 00:31:40,371
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait until the bearded idiot is asleep,

532
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:41,671
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then sneak into his room and...

533
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000


534
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000


535
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:57,716
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Captain.

536
00:31:57,782 --> 00:32:00,786
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's... It's Mr. Darwin, sir. I'm sure he's up to no good.

537
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:02,832
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honestly, Number Two, what's got into you?

538
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:06,096
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks to Charles, we're about to win lavish untold riches,

539
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:08,467
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and here you are trying to find fault with the poor fellow.

540
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,603
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yes, but... - No, no, no. Not another word.

541
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:14,269
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A future Pirate of the Year needs his beauty sleep.

542
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:17,142
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you think you could make nautical noises until we drop off?

543
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,485
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's lovely. Now, that is lovely.

544
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:28,147
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you do the shiver a timber?

545
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:36,331
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And just chuck in a few gulls, would you?

546
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:11,297
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ladies and gentlemen, our winner.

547
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:15,103
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give it up for the Pirate Captain!

548
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:34,455
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Congratulations, Pirate Captain.

549
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:37,622
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nobody deserves this more than you.

550
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:40,361
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks, Cutlass.

551
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:43,331
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that beard of yours,

552
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:46,157
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it drives me

553
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:48,204
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}crazy.

554
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,199
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give it here.

555
00:33:55,733 --> 00:33:57,474
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give it back, Bellamy, it's mine!

556
00:33:57,769 --> 00:33:59,407
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, give it back.

557
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:04,576
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Neptune's navel!

558
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:06,046
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come back here, you lubber.

559
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,282
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop, thief!

560
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:22,971
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll take that.

561
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:26,033
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not so fast, my friend.

562
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:28,439
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Number Two!

563
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:32,507
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Number Two, are you all right?

564
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:35,784
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Unhand that dodo!

565
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:46,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Evening, Captain.

566
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,347
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Number Two!

567
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:20,084
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're under attack!

568
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:21,787
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Abandon ship!

569
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,936
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello, Pirate Captain, Pirate with a Scarf!

570
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:43,915
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come back here, Mysterious Shadowy Figure!

571
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,223
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Faster! Faster!

572
00:36:17,141 --> 00:36:19,519
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Got you! Are you all right, girl?

573
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:22,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Captain! I mean, what's going on?

574
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,391
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't play the innocent.

575
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:27,986
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You and your hench-monkey tried to steal Polly.

576
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:31,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steal Polly? Dear me, no, you're mistaken.

577
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:33,829
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then how do you explain this?

578
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,557


579
00:36:40,557 --> 00:36:41,326


580
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:45,145
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I think it's obvious what's happened, isn't it?

581
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,273
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is it?

582
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:48,544
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some jealous rival scientist

583
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:51,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}must have tried to make off with the dodo.

584
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:54,019
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, that explains everything.

585
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:56,984
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Captain, please, let's go.

586
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,425
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Polly's not safe in London.

587
00:36:58,482 --> 00:37:00,689
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I couldn't bear it if something happened to Polly.

588
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:03,231
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing is going to happen to Polly.

589
00:37:03,287 --> 00:37:04,601
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She'll be perfectly safe.

590
00:37:04,602 --> 00:37:06,291
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Leave everything to me.

591
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:08,394
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, come on, we can't keep that prize waiting.

592
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:23,607
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anyone got a towel?

593
00:37:27,403 --> 00:37:29,634


594
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:36,654
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nice going, banana butt.

595
00:37:34,607 --> 00:37:36,607


596
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:39,495
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now this briny buffoon is gonna grab all the glory.

597
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:40,968
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a disaster.

598
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:42,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's...

599
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,306
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bad news, I'm afraid, Captain.

600
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:47,468
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't go in.

601
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:52,144
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's strictly scientists only, you see.

602
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:55,082
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll just have to present Polly

603
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:56,409
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}myself.

604
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:57,692
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're not really scientists.

605
00:37:57,693 --> 00:37:59,182
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's us, the pirates.

606
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:02,349
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See? Masters of disguise.

607
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,686
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But where's Polly?

608
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:06,285
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is on a need-to-know basis from here on in, Charles.

609
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,358
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Pardon? - I am keeping her hidden.

610
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:11,457
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That shadowy figure could be anywhere.

611
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:14,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Luckily, I am not only a master of disguises,

612
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:17,005
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am also a master of hiding things.

613
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:19,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right, lads, let's show these boffins what's what.

614
00:38:19,263 --> 00:38:20,901
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, Captain.

615
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,518
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really, I...

616
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:23,036
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello!

617
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:25,814
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're here for the science show.

618
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,577
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're scientists.

619
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:30,117
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a pipette, this is Charles Darwin,

620
00:38:30,174 --> 00:38:31,881
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I am the Scientist Captain.

621
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:35,883
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you're a scientist, name three elements.

622
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:37,151
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, let's see now.

623
00:38:37,214 --> 00:38:39,922
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's... There's gold, ham...

624
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:43,956
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and

625
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:45,398
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the tears of a mermaid.

626
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,288
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, two out of three. Close enough.

627
00:38:48,289 --> 00:38:49,596
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}First on your left.

628
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The balloon of my airship contains

629
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}20,000 cubic feet of hydrogen gas.

00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:26,372
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, dear.

738
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:30,344
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, we have a wonderful petting zoo at the palace

739
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:32,745
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}where Polly would be quite safe.

740
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:34,616
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perhaps we could

741
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:37,408
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}take her off your hands.

742
00:44:38,542 --> 00:44:40,988
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, ma'am, but that's out of the question.

743
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:42,456
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But she'd have a lovely time.

744
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:46,188
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There are guinea pigs and a donkey.

745
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:47,524
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, I couldn't, ma'am.

746
00:44:47,651 --> 00:44:51,724
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not even for little old me?

747
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:53,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no, I'm afraid not, ma'am.

748
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:54,812
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, you see,

749
00:44:54,813 --> 00:44:56,754
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}there is nothing more important to a pirate

750
00:44:56,755 --> 00:44:57,563
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}than his trusted dodo.

751
00:44:57,628 --> 00:45:00,575
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She is the feathery heart and soul of the boat.

752
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:03,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you say...

753
00:45:06,236 --> 00:45:07,306
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"pirate"?

754
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:10,818
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pirate? No, no, no, no, no.

755
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:12,251
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Scientist.

756
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:14,983
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, good old, good old science. Can't get enough of it.

757
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:16,319
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mixing stuff together.

758
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,382
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, test tube tubing and Bunsen burning.

759
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:19,951
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See?

760
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:24,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's no scientist!

761
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:26,368
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's a Girl Guide!

762
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:30,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's no Girl Guide!

763
00:45:30,594 --> 00:45:32,073
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He's a pirate! - Pirate!

764
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:36,339
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hang on, hang on.

765
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,825
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's been some kind of mistake.

766
00:45:37,826 --> 00:45:40,438
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some... Some silly mistake. Whoa, laddies!

767
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:42,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop, stop. I can explain.

768
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:00,268
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your Majesty.

769
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:02,126
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's hidden the dodo.

770
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:03,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you chop his head off now,

771
00:46:03,494 --> 00:46:05,269
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we might never find out where.

772
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:06,764
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait a mo.

773
00:46:18,408 --> 00:46:20,513
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One doesn't know why.

774
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:24,753
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perhaps it's his luxuriant beard or his gleaming teeth

775
00:46:24,915 --> 00:46:27,896
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or the way he smells faintly of coconuts.

776
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:31,023
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But we have taken a shine to this pirate.

777
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:34,564
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you have a name, pirate captain?

778
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:37,905
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They call me the Pirate Captain.

779
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,275
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, Pirate Captain,

780
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:44,073
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we hereby pardon you of your piratical crimes.

781
00:46:49,072 --> 00:46:50,949
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You will stay in London, Pirate Captain,

782
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:53,818
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and entertain us with your stories and your wit.

783
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:56,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And especially

784
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:01,356
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}your dear little dodo.

785
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:06,559
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hell's barnacles.

786
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:08,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can we please get out of here now?

787
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:09,996
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was a bit close for comfort, Number Two.

788
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,198
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I will get you the dodo, Your Majesty.

789
00:47:13,263 --> 00:47:15,641
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See that you do, Mr. Darwin.

790
00:47:21,772 --> 00:47:23,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Captain?

791
00:47:23,574 --> 00:47:25,875
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Captain! Captain!

792
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:27,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hurry up, lads, chop-chop.

793
00:47:27,811 --> 00:47:29,222
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's get back to sea where we belong.

794
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ave, aye, Captain!

795
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:32,626
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told you coming to London was a bad idea.

796
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The sooner I get the smell of brine in my...

797
00:47:34,117 --> 00:47:35,528
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Captain!

798
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:37,264
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Captain!

799
00:47:40,457 --> 00:47:42,232
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not leaving, surely?

800
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,337
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I most certainly am.

801
00:47:44,394 --> 00:47:45,839
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've let me down badly, Charles.

802
00:47:46,163 --> 00:47:47,665
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look! Look!

803
00:47:47,731 --> 00:47:48,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Also, to be frank...

804
00:47:48,371 --> 00:47:48,835
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Captain.

805
00:47:48,899 --> 00:47:50,674
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}your nose is too small for your face.

806
00:47:51,001 --> 00:47:52,776
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you're the toast of London Town.

807
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:58,715
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I say, look at that.

808
00:47:57,065 --> 00:47:59,345


809
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,212
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They've really captured my eyes.

810
00:48:01,311 --> 00:48:04,068
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We were hoping you might come out

811
00:48:04,069 --> 00:48:06,826
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for a little celebration before you go.

812
00:48:08,986 --> 00:48:11,899
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't want to miss the tide, Captain.

813
00:48:11,955 --> 00:48:13,392
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no. Quite right, quite right.

814
00:48:13,393 --> 00:48:13,992
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Captain,

815
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:16,904
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}do join us, please?

816
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:20,904
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll just stop for a quick one. Rude to refuse.

817
00:48:20,964 --> 00:48:22,466
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- But it's Ham Night. - I'll be 20 minutes.

818
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:23,636
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Half an hour tops.

819
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,611
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just get her... get her warmed up without me.

820
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:26,739
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aren't we going yet?

821
00:48:27,537 --> 00:48:29,915
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But what about winning the Pirate of the Year

822
00:48:29,973 --> 00:48:32,476
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and showing all those other captains that he's not a loser?

823
00:48:40,717 --> 00:48:43,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come along, Captain.

824
00:48:43,287 --> 00:48:44,595
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Captain...

825
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:46,533
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Cheers! - Good evening.

826
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,263
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you. Thank you so very much.

827
00:48:48,325 --> 00:48:49,702
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Captain... - And your name is?

828
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,761
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Miss Jane Austen.

829
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,761


830
00:48:56,967 --> 00:49:00,471
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that, and that is why, in a straight fight,

831
00:49:00,537 --> 00:49:03,416
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a shark would probably beat a Dracula.

832
00:49:04,308 --> 00:49:06,845
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jane Austen, feel free to use it in one of your books.

833
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:10,255
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pirate Captain, you are a born raconteur.

834
00:49:10,547 --> 00:49:13,994
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So much better than the last chap we all went doolally over.

835
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:17,758
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've all been terribly kind.

836
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:20,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do run along.

837
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:21,761
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Another drink, Captain?

838
00:49:22,526 --> 00:49:24,631
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cheers, Chuck.

839
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:29,246
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I say, you're not related in some way, are you?

840
00:49:29,247 --> 00:49:30,575
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pardon?

841
00:49:31,401 --> 00:49:32,471
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just you, sort of...

842
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:35,377
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, no, no, nothing, nothing, nothing.

843
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:37,146
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cheers.

844
00:49:45,782 --> 00:49:47,921
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you know what I've discovered, Charles?

845
00:49:48,018 --> 00:49:50,692
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The friends you make after you've become famous

846
00:49:50,754 --> 00:49:52,734
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}are better, truer friends

847
00:49:52,789 --> 00:49:54,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}than the ones you've had for years beforehand.

848
00:49:54,925 --> 00:49:56,927
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So very wise.

849
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:00,669
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But the lads will think I'm a fool.

850
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:03,507
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. A fool, you?

851
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:05,672
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're an intellectual giant.

852
00:50:05,736 --> 00:50:08,376
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just look at how you managed to keep Polly safe

853
00:50:08,438 --> 00:50:10,145
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}from those sinister forces.

854
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,776
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, I did do that, didn't I?

855
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,446
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You did.

856
00:50:13,543 --> 00:50:15,784
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And wherever she's hidden,

857
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,292
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I bet it's somewhere really ingenious.

858
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:19,349
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is rather.

859
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:22,696
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll never guess where.

860
00:50:22,753 --> 00:50:25,791
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, no, why, you're too smart for me, Captain.

861
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:27,961
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right under everyone's noses.

862
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:30,505
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or right under my noses, anyhow.

863
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:34,698
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ta-da!

864
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:40,846
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've been keeping Polly in your beard?

865
00:50:41,004 --> 00:50:43,143
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Actually, I keep all sorts in here.

866
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:46,881
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry about this, Captain.

867
00:50:47,883 --> 00:50:48,354
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}About what?

868
00:50:50,251 --> 00:50:51,574


869
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,191
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the... What's the monkey-man playing at?

870
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:56,053
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This patently isn't even a real...

871
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:07,768
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come back here, you lubbers!

872
00:51:13,503 --> 00:51:15,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, your reverence.

873
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:32,897
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Got you, you rogue!

874
00:51:32,897 --> 00:51:33,897


875
00:51:39,796 --> 00:51:41,469
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, that's rather nice.

876
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:45,538
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Neptune's lips, what are you up to?

877
00:51:45,702 --> 00:51:47,079
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It's not my fault.

878
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:48,741
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you mean "not your fault"?

879
00:51:48,805 --> 00:51:49,793
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You steal Polly,

880
00:51:49,794 --> 00:51:51,376
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you shoot my best hat full of holes.

881
00:51:53,076 --> 00:51:53,976


882
00:52:09,993 --> 00:52:11,097
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, go on, then.

883
00:52:11,528 --> 00:52:12,871
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Explain yourself.

884
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:15,934
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's this girl.

885
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:18,309
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm hopelessly smitten with her.

886
00:52:18,368 --> 00:52:20,041
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm listening.

887
00:52:20,103 --> 00:52:23,983
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know how partial she is to exotic animals,

888
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,816
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I thought if I could get her the do-do,

889
00:52:26,877 --> 00:52:30,347
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then she might like me.

890
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:34,317
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm so ashamed.

891
00:52:34,584 --> 00:52:36,461
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why didn't you say so?

892
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:39,593
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've all done stupid things to impress girls.

893
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:41,192
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, you should act aloof.

894
00:52:41,258 --> 00:52:43,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They love it when you act aloof.

895
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:44,704
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Still, must be quite a girl

896
00:52:44,705 --> 00:52:45,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for you to go to all that trouble.

897
00:52:45,962 --> 00:52:48,636
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She is quite a girl.

898
00:52:49,966 --> 00:52:51,707
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kraken's biscuits!

899
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:54,342
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Darwin.

900
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:58,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honestly, Charles.

901
00:52:58,475 --> 00:53:01,945
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the bun. The bun really does it for me.

902
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,582
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I see you've brought a friend.

903
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:04,984
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How delightful.

904
00:53:05,048 --> 00:53:07,187
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

905
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:08,226
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, get a grip, man.

906
00:53:08,227 --> 00:53:10,424
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You couldn't manage one tiny task, could you?

907
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:12,489
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's pathetic.

908
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:44,661
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, Captain, I can see I've gone about this all wrong.

909
00:53:46,656 --> 00:53:50,798
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see, I might have the body of a weak and feeble woman,

910
00:53:52,929 --> 00:53:54,765
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I have the heart and soul

911
00:53:54,766 --> 00:53:57,742
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}of a person who really, really wants that dodo.

912
00:54:18,054 --> 00:54:20,713
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I seem to recall that you piratical

913
00:54:20,714 --> 00:54:24,437
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}types have a bit of a soft spot for shiny things.

914
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:27,541
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or am I getting you muddled up with magpies?

915
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:29,736
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I couldn't.

916
00:54:29,799 --> 00:54:32,575
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, Polly, she's a family...

917
00:54:32,736 --> 00:54:35,307
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come now, Captain, it's so simple.

918
00:54:35,805 --> 00:54:38,183
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Polly here could live like a queen at my petting zoo,

919
00:54:38,241 --> 00:54:41,882
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you... Well...

920
00:54:42,712 --> 00:54:45,215
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With treasure like this,

921
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:49,995
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you could be famed across the seven seas.

922
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:55,595
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Captain.

923
00:54:55,659 --> 00:54:58,003
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Polly's not for sale.

924
00:54:59,996 --> 00:55:02,135
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You? Win Pirate of the Year?

925
00:55:02,198 --> 00:55:03,677
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're a shoo-in, sir.

926
00:55:03,733 --> 00:55:06,771
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's not a pirate on the seven seas can match you.

927
00:55:06,836 --> 00:55:08,838
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But what about winning Pirate of the Year

928
00:55:08,905 --> 00:55:11,886
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and showing all those other captains that you're not a loser?

929
00:55:11,941 --> 00:55:14,512
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Loser... loser...

930
00:55:16,713 --> 00:55:19,489
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm a floating head.

931
00:55:20,383 --> 00:55:21,919
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, Captain.

932
00:55:22,552 --> 00:55:25,829
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you going to do the right thing?

933
00:55:30,226 --> 00:55:34,368
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sailing out on the ocean

934
00:55:34,431 --> 00:55:37,503
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Out on the deep blue sea

935
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:40,207
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}20 minutes, he said.

936
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:41,874
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Didn't he say 20 minutes?

937
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:43,279
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry, lads.

938
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,842
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He probably just got caught up,

939
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:49,647
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}battling a giant squid or something.

940
00:55:58,822 --> 00:56:00,267
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, come on, you lubbers!

941
00:56:00,323 --> 00:56:01,495
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's him!

942
00:56:01,558 --> 00:56:02,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told you!

943
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:05,102
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I... I told you he wouldn't let us down.

944
00:56:05,161 --> 00:56:06,435
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello, boys.

945
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:08,932
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Miss me?

946
00:56:09,065 --> 00:56:11,136
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm having a mirage.

947
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:13,738
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But... how?

948
00:56:13,803 --> 00:56:14,941
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good question, Number Two.

949
00:56:15,004 --> 00:56:18,417
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I stole it all in a daring raid on the Tower of London.

950
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:23,523
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You stole all this from the Tower of London?

951
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:24,615
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's right.

952
00:56:24,681 --> 00:56:25,699
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then I burnt it to the ground,

953
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:26,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}wrestled a bear,

954
00:56:27,016 --> 00:56:29,053
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I kissed a princess for good measure.

955
00:56:29,953 --> 00:56:31,261
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, what are you waiting for?

956
00:56:31,262 --> 00:56:32,866
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't just stand there like porpoises.

957
00:56:32,922 --> 00:56:34,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a trophy with our names on it!

958
00:56:37,193 --> 00:56:39,561
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Set a course for Blood Island!

959
00:56:44,434 --> 00:56:46,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Avast, me hearties!

960
00:56:44,755 --> 00:56:47,059


961
00:56:46,536 --> 00:56:51,815
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And welcome to the 59th Annual Pirate of the Year Awards!

962
00:57:10,293 --> 00:57:12,034
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the ticket, eh, Number Two?

963
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:14,132
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please, please, please, can't Polly come out now?

964
00:57:14,664 --> 00:57:16,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Best not.

965
00:57:17,634 --> 00:57:18,908
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's still very tired.

966
00:57:18,968 --> 00:57:20,606
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And here is your host for the evening...

967
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:24,374
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Pirate King!

968
00:57:28,678 --> 00:57:32,353
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello, Pirates!

969
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:34,088
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello, Pirate King!

970
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:35,888
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Any lubbers in tonight?

971
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:37,363
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

972
00:57:42,058 --> 00:57:43,298
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Behind you!

973
00:57:44,894 --> 00:57:45,895
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm Queen Victoria!

974
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:47,737
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I hate pirates!

975
00:57:51,067 --> 00:57:52,444
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, cheer up.

976
00:57:52,502 --> 00:57:54,379
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And now, you swabs,

977
00:57:54,437 --> 00:57:57,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}this is the big one.

978
00:57:57,807 --> 00:58:02,415
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The nominees for Pirate of the Year are as follows:

979
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:05,187
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Black Bellamy.

980
00:58:05,348 --> 00:58:07,328
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cutlass Liz.

981
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:09,691
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Peg-Leg Hastings.

982
00:58:09,853 --> 00:58:13,266
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And a surprise late entry,

983
00:58:13,423 --> 00:58:15,528
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the Pirate Captain!

984
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:20,835
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The panel of independent judges

985
00:58:20,964 --> 00:58:24,036
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}have counted each pirate's booty and declared

986
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:27,781
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that this year's winner is

987
00:58:29,138 --> 00:58:32,176
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the Pirate Captain!

988
00:59:20,189 --> 00:59:21,759
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me!

989
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:25,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me.

990
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:27,833
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, this is all very moving.

991
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:29,934
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm welling up here, but...

992
00:59:30,099 --> 00:59:32,705
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bellamy, this is the most irregular!

993
00:59:33,269 --> 00:59:34,714
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So is this!

994
00:59:35,214 --> 00:59:35,914


995
00:59:41,214 --> 00:59:43,014


996
00:59:42,645 --> 00:59:48,721
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It seems Queen Victoria has pardoned the Pirate Captain.

997
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:50,693
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

998
00:59:52,388 --> 00:59:53,423
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So what if she did?

999
00:59:53,489 --> 00:59:55,127
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you've been pardoned,

1000
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:57,999
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then, technically, you're no longer a pirate.

1001
00:59:58,528 --> 01:00:00,565
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And if you're no longer a pirate,

1002
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:04,002
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you really can't be Pirate of the Year,

1003
01:00:04,467 --> 01:00:05,969
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}now, can you?

1004
01:00:06,035 --> 01:00:08,606
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No, you can't! - That's right!

1005
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:10,216
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is this true?

1006
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,833
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, that's one, frankly,

1007
01:00:12,834 --> 01:00:14,087
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}rather negative way of looking at it.

1008
01:00:15,244 --> 01:00:18,191
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Villainous treachery!

1009
01:00:18,247 --> 01:00:21,126
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Treacherous villainy!

1010
01:00:21,184 --> 01:00:24,165
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have betrayed the pirating fraternity.

1011
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:25,891
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, Pirate King...

1012
01:00:26,089 --> 01:00:28,501
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your pirate hat and coat!

1013
01:00:43,172 --> 01:00:46,483
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your pirate badge with googly eyes.

1014
01:00:46,542 --> 01:00:50,786
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And your World of Hooks discount card.

1015
01:00:51,014 --> 01:00:52,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Confiscate his treasure!

1016
01:00:52,749 --> 01:00:55,286
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Every last bit of it.

1017
01:00:55,451 --> 01:00:59,126
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Begone! May your lubber shame bear down upon you.

1018
01:00:59,288 --> 01:01:02,701
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are hereby banished from Blood Island!

1019
01:01:04,193 --> 01:01:08,196
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are a pirate no more!

1020
01:01:18,474 --> 01:01:19,817
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And stay out!

1021
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:27,086
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, well, not a... Not a total success.

1022
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:29,824
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't need them and their stupid awards.

1023
01:01:29,886 --> 01:01:32,958
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The best thing about being a pirate isn't the treasure.

1024
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:34,933
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's the cutlasses. - It's Ham Night.

1025
01:01:34,991 --> 01:01:36,698
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's Polly.

1026
01:01:36,759 --> 01:01:39,467
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where is Polly, Captain?

1027
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:41,509
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you mean? You know where she is.

1028
01:01:41,564 --> 01:01:43,908
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's been upset enough.

1029
01:01:43,966 --> 01:01:45,036
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Captain...

1030
01:01:48,738 --> 01:01:50,342
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, Okay.

1031
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:01,453
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I sold her to Queen Victoria for a boatload of treasure.

1032
01:02:01,517 --> 01:02:04,088
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There, I've said it.

1033
01:02:12,028 --> 01:02:14,531
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, come on. She was just a parrot.

1034
01:02:14,597 --> 01:02:16,338
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, she wasn't even a parrot.

1035
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:18,709
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Always weeing on the boat's carpets, biting everyone.

1036
01:02:18,768 --> 01:02:21,476
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She gave half of us tetanus, for goodness sake.

1037
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:24,216
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But she was our Polly.

1038
01:02:24,273 --> 01:02:26,549
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, you know, you should be happy for her.

1039
01:02:26,609 --> 01:02:28,987
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She'll be, she'll be living the high life.

1040
01:02:29,846 --> 01:02:33,953
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eating gold bricks wrapped up in, you know, swans.

1041
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:40,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, where are you swabs going? Come on.

1042
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:42,223
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, we'll have an adventure

1043
01:02:42,224 --> 01:02:44,201
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}somewhere tropical with those native ladies

1044
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:47,298
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}whose outfits don't leave much to the imagination.

1045
01:02:49,232 --> 01:02:53,044
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Looks like it's just you and me now, eh, Number Two?

1046
01:02:53,536 --> 01:02:55,516
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good old inseparable you and me.

1047
01:02:55,571 --> 01:02:57,141
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Us two against the world, eh?

1048
01:02:58,274 --> 01:03:00,845

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just wait until you see what I've got for the main course.

1155
01:09:16,118 --> 01:09:17,859
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gaston?

1156
01:09:18,053 --> 01:09:19,225
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gaston?

1157
01:09:19,889 --> 01:09:21,266
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you there?

1158
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:22,324
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oui, Your Majesty.

1159
01:09:22,391 --> 01:09:24,366
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gaston, I think we're ready.

1160
01:09:24,367 --> 01:09:25,302
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Neptune's teeth.

1161
01:09:26,395 --> 01:09:28,238
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's not a moment to lose. We've got to find that kitchen.

1162
01:09:28,297 --> 01:09:30,868
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But it's hopeless. Where do we even start to...

1163
01:09:31,033 --> 01:09:33,399
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So that's why I reckon, in a straight fight,

1164
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:35,935
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a shark would probably beat a Dracula.

1165
01:09:35,936 --> 01:09:36,481
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

1166
01:09:36,539 --> 01:09:39,679
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}'Course, a Frankenstein versus a jellyfish...

1167
01:09:36,539 --> 01:09:39,679


1168
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:41,583
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, that's a different matter.

1169
01:09:44,313 --> 01:09:45,951
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All clear, Chuck.

1170
01:09:47,216 --> 01:09:48,661
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chuck?

1171
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:52,128
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's all right, Charles, I'm coming!

1172
01:09:52,128 --> 01:09:53,128


1173
01:09:53,389 --> 01:09:55,596
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Don't worry, I'll just... - Charles?

1174
01:09:56,458 --> 01:09:58,165
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just... Just hang on!

1175
01:09:59,844 --> 01:10:04,285


1176
01:10:01,263 --> 01:10:02,833
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Charles?

1177
01:10:06,402 --> 01:10:07,574
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Poseidon's lips!

1178
01:10:07,636 --> 01:10:09,741
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you all right, Charles?

1179
01:10:11,607 --> 01:10:13,348
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, you there!

1180
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:14,782
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing here?

1181
01:10:14,843 --> 01:10:17,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, now. Excellent question.

1182
01:10:17,246 --> 01:10:20,227
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All exotic animals should have been delivered to the chef by now.

1183
01:10:20,482 --> 01:10:21,654
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What? - What is it?

1184
01:10:21,717 --> 01:10:22,821
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some sort of duck?

1185
01:10:23,953 --> 01:10:26,229
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, yes. That's it, yes.

1186
01:10:29,158 --> 01:10:30,398
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hurry up, then. Kitchen's that way.

1187
01:10:30,559 --> 01:10:32,266
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, come away! Go on.

1188
01:10:34,296 --> 01:10:37,436
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here we go, my pretty...

1189
01:10:37,967 --> 01:10:40,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's time to be

1190
01:10:42,137 --> 01:10:44,242
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}delicieux!

1191
01:10:47,409 --> 01:10:48,683
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mon dieu!

1192
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:57,864
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Polly, come to Daddy.

1193
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:00,161
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, old girl.

1194
01:11:00,222 --> 01:11:03,032
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I will never, ever leave you again. I promise.

1195
01:11:03,759 --> 01:11:05,534
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I will never leave you.

1196
01:11:07,396 --> 01:11:08,773
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perhaps we'd best make a move.

1197
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:12,477
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, yes, yes, of course. Back to the balloon.

1198
01:11:12,534 --> 01:11:13,535
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gaston?

1199
01:11:13,802 --> 01:11:14,872
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gaston?

1200
01:11:15,871 --> 01:11:17,316
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

1201
01:11:18,607 --> 01:11:20,245
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Captain. No.

1202
01:11:20,476 --> 01:11:22,547
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello, Your Majesty.

1203
01:11:22,611 --> 01:11:25,922
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The dodo is coming out de suite.

1204
01:11:26,015 --> 01:11:28,996
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- This really isn't wise. - Claudette est dans la bibliotheque.

1205
01:11:29,051 --> 01:11:30,086
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please, I think we...

1206
01:11:30,152 --> 01:11:33,258
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you know, Your Majesty, you cannot hurry the cooking.

1207
01:11:33,322 --> 01:11:35,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a very delicate recipe, uh?

1208
01:11:36,091 --> 01:11:39,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the dodo is a very fattening dish.

1209
01:11:39,528 --> 01:11:40,905
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perhaps is not so good for you.

1210
01:11:40,996 --> 01:11:41,587
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, you know,

1211
01:11:41,588 --> 01:11:43,806
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the calories they will go straight to your chubby thighs.

1212
01:11:43,866 --> 01:11:44,301
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Captain.

1213
01:11:44,302 --> 01:11:45,607
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A minute on the lips

1214
01:11:45,668 --> 01:11:46,772
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is a lifetime on the...

1215
01:11:47,369 --> 01:11:48,746
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Zut alors!

1216
01:11:50,072 --> 01:11:52,173
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pirate Captain.

1217
01:11:53,909 --> 01:11:55,684
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here you are again. And...

1218
01:11:55,744 --> 01:11:57,155
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh. My...

1219
01:11:57,313 --> 01:12:00,419
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that Mr. Darwin behind those feathers?

1220
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:01,483
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello.

1221
01:12:01,684 --> 01:12:04,858
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What a delightfully unexpected surprise.

1222
01:12:05,287 --> 01:12:09,064
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, I think, secretly...

1223
01:12:10,959 --> 01:12:14,031
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've always loved you, Charles.

1224
01:12:14,763 --> 01:12:16,208
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gosh.

1225
01:12:16,932 --> 01:12:18,002
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really?

1226
01:12:18,734 --> 01:12:19,735
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

1227
01:12:24,039 --> 01:12:26,451
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give me my dodo!

1228
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:29,485
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, come on, Vickie, be sensible.

1229
01:12:29,645 --> 01:12:31,594
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just you, a tiny queen against me,

1230
01:12:31,595 --> 01:12:34,627
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a dashing terror of the high seas.

1231
01:12:34,683 --> 01:12:36,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}En garde!

1232
01:12:36,618 --> 01:12:37,722
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, dear!

1233
01:12:37,786 --> 01:12:39,766
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Poor defenseless me.

1234
01:12:41,156 --> 01:12:43,158
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is a girl to do?

1235
01:12:46,929 --> 01:12:48,067
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, steady on.

1236
01:12:50,332 --> 01:12:51,402
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now careful.

1237
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,807
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you know why I really hate pirates?

1238
01:12:53,969 --> 01:12:54,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Childhood trauma, was it?

1239
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:57,141
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bitten by a pirate when you were a baby?

1240
01:12:58,440 --> 01:12:59,441
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Beard envy?

1241
01:12:59,508 --> 01:13:01,545
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's because you're out-of-date.

1242
01:13:01,777 --> 01:13:03,415
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're dinosaurs!

1243
01:13:03,579 --> 01:13:06,651
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All that "romance of the seas". Guff!

1244
01:13:17,259 --> 01:13:19,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right, where were we?

1245
01:13:19,762 --> 01:13:21,173
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at you.

1246
01:13:21,363 --> 01:13:22,842
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should be extinct.

1247
01:13:27,369 --> 01:13:29,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Along with your little friend!

1248
01:13:43,752 --> 01:13:45,095
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pity you can't eat pirates, really.

1249
01:13:48,724 --> 01:13:52,604
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you'd probably taste of barnacles.

1250
01:13:52,761 --> 01:13:56,709
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whereas, dear little Polly here is going to be

1251
01:13:56,932 --> 01:14:02,006
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}absolutely delicious!

1252
01:14:05,574 --> 01:14:06,746
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Bobo?

1253
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:10,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give me back my dinner!

1254
01:14:10,646 --> 01:14:13,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Captain, catch! - Number Two!

1255
01:14:17,753 --> 01:14:18,788
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, Vickie.

1256
01:14:18,954 --> 01:14:21,298
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dodo is off the menu.

1257
01:14:28,931 --> 01:14:30,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, stop!

1258
01:14:33,368 --> 01:14:34,403
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop!

1259
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:39,675
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop!

1260
01:14:42,778 --> 01:14:45,657
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm being squashed by giant barrels of vinegar!

1261
01:14:53,088 --> 01:14:54,158
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good work, Chuck.

1262
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:55,597
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Number Two, what are you doing here?

1263
01:14:55,724 --> 01:14:57,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How did you find me? Where are the lads?

1264
01:14:57,793 --> 01:14:59,898
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry, they're on the case.

1265
01:15:05,767 --> 01:15:07,974
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's all thanks to Mr. Bobo here.

1266
01:15:08,036 --> 01:15:10,915
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He rowed halfway across the ocean to tell us what you were up to.

1267
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:14,245
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, you know, I figured you

1268
01:15:14,309 --> 01:15:16,619
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}tend to end up wrapped in sausages facing certain death

1269
01:15:16,712 --> 01:15:18,589
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}at about this point in an adventure.

1270
01:15:18,647 --> 01:15:19,955
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

1271
01:15:22,317 --> 01:15:23,796
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

1272
01:15:24,486 --> 01:15:27,592
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, Number Two, I...

1273
01:15:27,723 --> 01:15:30,431
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I realize I let you down.

1274
01:15:34,696 --> 01:15:36,073
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry.

1275
01:15:36,131 --> 01:15:37,474
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I let everybody down.

1276
01:15:38,166 --> 01:15:40,442
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, I've...

1277
01:15:40,602 --> 01:15:42,124
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I've done some pretty

1278
01:15:42,125 --> 01:15:44,379
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}appalling things in my piratical career.

1279
01:15:44,439 --> 01:15:47,386
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like that time I used babies as squid bait.

1280
01:15:47,743 --> 01:15:49,552
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or that other time I thought it would be

1281
01:15:49,711 --> 01:15:51,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}okay to let a turtle drive the boat.

1282
01:15:51,947 --> 01:15:53,824
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But the thing is...

1283
01:15:54,016 --> 01:15:56,155
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, what I'm trying to say is...

1284
01:15:56,652 --> 01:16:00,065
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You decided to single-handedly take on Queen Victoria's flagship

1285
01:16:00,122 --> 01:16:01,624
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in order to rescue Polly.

1286
01:16:02,724 --> 01:16:04,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, I'm afraid I did.

1287
01:16:06,595 --> 01:16:09,474
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's terrifically idiotic.

1288
01:16:09,631 --> 01:16:10,701
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

1289
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:14,403
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's also the reason why me and the lads

1290
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:17,141
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}well, we still think

1291
01:16:14,608 --> 01:16:16,990


1292
01:16:17,205 --> 01:16:20,345
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you're the best pirate on the seven sea.

1293
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:31,959
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gadzooks!

1294
01:16:32,487 --> 01:16:34,194
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

1295
01:16:51,907 --> 01:16:52,908
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Polly!

1296
01:16:54,042 --> 01:16:55,077
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no, you don't.

1297
01:16:55,143 --> 01:16:56,178
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Captain?

1298
01:17:05,787 --> 01:17:08,859
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kiss your beaky little friend goodbye.

1299
01:17:27,442 --> 01:17:29,945
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's it, Polly. Snip-snip.

1300
01:17:30,012 --> 01:17:32,288
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, little dodo. Bitey-bite.

1301
01:17:32,447 --> 01:17:34,188
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The dumpy lady's got Polly!

1302
01:17:34,449 --> 01:17:35,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Snip-Snip.

1303
01:17:37,252 --> 01:17:38,356
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bite it!

1304
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:40,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bite it, you stupid bird!

1305
01:17:40,288 --> 01:17:42,063
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bite it!

1306
01:17:48,463 --> 01:17:50,067
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

1307
01:17:50,132 --> 01:17:51,475
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My dodo!

1308
01:17:51,533 --> 01:17:52,603
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Polly!

1309
01:17:52,768 --> 01:17:54,839
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My dinner!

1310
01:18:10,285 --> 01:18:11,787
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Barnacles.

1311
01:18:31,339 --> 01:18:33,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well done, sir.

1312
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:36,181
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wah-hey, Captain!

1313
01:18:37,512 --> 01:18:39,185
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fair play to you, sir.

1314
01:18:44,886 --> 01:18:48,993
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is our most unexpectedly heartwarming adventure ever.

1315
01:18:49,057 --> 01:18:51,537
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll swing for this! Curse you!

1316
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:54,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And after you've done swinging, I'll chop your head off!

1317
01:18:55,030 --> 01:18:57,806
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll put it in a cannon and fire it into the sun!

1318
01:18:57,866 --> 01:19:00,369
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Does that mean he's not pardoned anymore?

1319
01:19:00,435 --> 01:19:02,073
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Pardoned"?

1320
01:19:03,505 --> 01:19:07,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll be outlawed across the globe!

1321
01:19:07,242 --> 01:19:08,662
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There'll be a higher price

1322
01:19:08,663 --> 01:19:10,849
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}on your head than any pirate before you!

1323
01:19:11,279 --> 01:19:15,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The whole world will know your name!

1324
01:19:19,454 --> 01:19:21,195
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Welcome back,

1325
01:19:21,823 --> 01:19:23,234
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Captain.

1326
01:19:47,849 --> 01:19:49,726
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- See ya! - Bye!

1327
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:53,148
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can get it if you really want

1328
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:56,831
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can get it if you really want

1329
01:19:51,560 --> 01:20:00,168
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can get it if you really want

1330
01:19:51,560 --> 01:20:03,819
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you must try, try and try, try and try

1331
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:03,367
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, it's been a pleasure, Charles.

1332
01:20:03,431 --> 01:20:05,104
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good luck with the science.

1333
01:20:05,267 --> 01:20:06,409
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you, Captain.

1334
01:20:06,410 --> 01:20:07,838
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And just a little tip

1335
01:20:07,903 --> 01:20:09,382
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}grow yourself a beard.

1336
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:11,075
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It'll make your face look less lumpy.

1337
01:20:17,875 --> 01:20:19,755
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rome was not build in a day

1338
01:20:18,275 --> 01:20:23,119
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And opposition will come your way

1339
01:20:18,275 --> 01:20:27,016
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But the harder the battle you see

1340
01:20:18,275 --> 01:20:31,152
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The sweeter the victory, now

1341
01:20:32,027 --> 01:20:34,064
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}100,000 doubloons.

1342
01:20:32,027 --> 01:20:34,064


1343
01:20:35,931 --> 01:20:37,911
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not bad, eh, Mr. Bobo?

1344
01:20:38,006 --> 01:20:39,857


1345
01:20:38,629 --> 01:20:41,438
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can get it if you really want

1346
01:20:41,934 --> 01:20:47,459
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you must try, try and try, try and try

1347
01:20:48,276 --> 01:20:50,731
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll succeed at last

1348
01:20:52,347 --> 01:20:54,657
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That... I...

1349
01:20:55,717 --> 01:20:58,459
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Is this a bit of squid tentacle? - Yeah.

1350
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:00,056
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that's my earwax.

1351
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:05,874
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I keep telling you,

1352
01:21:05,875 --> 01:21:08,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it's never been about the trophies or the treasure.

1353
01:21:08,230 --> 01:21:10,767
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's about who you are, inside.

1354
01:21:12,334 --> 01:21:13,836
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I say, you're not...

1355
01:21:13,902 --> 01:21:16,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not a woman disguised as a man, are you, Number Two?

1356
01:21:16,371 --> 01:21:17,441
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

1357
01:21:17,505 --> 01:21:19,849
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because that does happen surprisingly often at sea.

1358
01:21:19,849 --> 01:21:22,806
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But the harder the battle you see

1359
01:21:22,849 --> 01:21:26,658
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The sweeter the victory, now

1360
01:21:27,109 --> 01:21:30,479
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can get it if you really want

1361
01:21:31,219 --> 01:21:34,354
