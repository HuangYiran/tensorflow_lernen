530
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:32,950
{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mustn't talk when Mother's not here.

531
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:36,150
{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you won't even talk to me,\nI'm gonna find the other Wybie.

532
00:54:36,230 --> 00:54:38,130
{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He'll help me.\n- No point.

533
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:42,630
{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He pulled a long face,\nand Mother didn't like it.

534
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:10,220
{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And what do you think you're doing?

535
00:55:10,690 --> 00:55:14,720
{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I'm getting out of here.\nThat's what I'm doing.

536
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,530
{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Huh?

537
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:20,970
{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something's wrong.\nShouldn't the old well be here?

538
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,030
{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing out here.

539
00:55:23,110 --> 00:55:25,540
{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the empty part of this world.

540
00:55:25,610 --> 00:55:28,940
{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She only made\nwhat she knew would impress you.

541
00:55:29,010 --> 00:55:31,910
{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But why? Why does she want me?

542
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:35,350
{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She wants something to love, I think.

543
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:37,890
{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something that isn't her.

544
00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:42,580
{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or maybe she'd just love something to eat.

545
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:46,880
{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eat? That's ridiculous.\nMothers don't eat daughters.

546
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:49,990
{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. How do you taste?

547
00:55:57,470 --> 00:55:58,460
{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}CORALINE: Huh?

548
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:04,250
{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But how can you walk away from something\nand still come back to it?

549
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:08,240
{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Walk around the world.

550
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:09,550
{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Small world.

551
00:56:10,850 --> 00:56:12,080
{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hang on.

552
00:56:16,690 --> 00:56:19,180
{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop! He's one of the circus mice!

553

00:56:31,470 --> 00:56:34,410
{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but this one was sounding an alarm.

555
00:56:37,350 --> 00:56:38,710
{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good kitty.

556
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:20,680
{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They say even the proudest spirit\ncan be broken with love.

557
00:57:25,530 --> 00:57:29,430
{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course, chocolate never hurts. Like one?

558
00:57:30,770 --> 00:57:34,230
{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're cocoa beetles from Zanzibar.

559
00:57:37,770 --> 00:57:42,580
{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want to be with my real mom and dad.

560
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:45,240
{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want you to let me go.

561
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:49,380
{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that any way to talk to your mother?

562
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:52,010
{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You aren't my mother.

563
00:57:52,090 --> 00:57:56,250
{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Apologize at once, Coraline!

564
00:57:57,230 --> 00:57:58,250
{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

565

{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two.

568
00:58:10,770 --> 00:58:11,760
{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Three!

569
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:16,670
{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing? Ow! That hurts!

570
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:23,920
{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You may come out when you've learned\nto be a loving daughter.

571
00:58:36,030 --> 00:58:37,470
{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's there?

574
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:00,550
{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who are you?

575
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:04,660
{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't remember our names,

576
00:59:04,730 --> 00:59:07,860
{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I 'member my true mommy.

{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}GHOST CHILDREN: The beldam.

579
00:59:14,070 --> 00:59:18,910
{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She spied on our lives\nthrough the little doll's eyes.

{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}TALL GIRL GHOST:\nSo she lured us away with treasures.

582
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:29,350
{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- And treats.\n- SWEET GIRL GHOST: And games to play.

00:59:53,010 --> 00:59:57,000
{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, she can't keep me in the dark forever.

590
00:59:57,850 --> 01:00:00,250
{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not if she wants to win my life.

591
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:04,550
{\fnCambria\fs18\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Beating her is my only chance.
