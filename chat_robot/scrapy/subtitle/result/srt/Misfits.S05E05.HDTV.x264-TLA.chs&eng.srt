欲将芳容比长夏
Should I compare thee to a summer's day?

00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:04,220
而你比它更可爱(莎士比亚)
Thou art more lovely.

3
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:05,280
你觉得这好笑么?
You're laughing at that?

4
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,600
我还不能笑了么
I am allowed to laugh.

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,750
是他! 鲁迪2号!
It's him! It's Rudy 2!

6
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:11,730
退后点!
Stand back!

7
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:13,510
你是个医生?
Are you a doctor?

8
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:14,750
我是个电工
I'm an electrician.

9
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:21,960
有人被困在这里面了?
There's someone inside of there?

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,810
是啊
Yeah.

11
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,990
一个有超能力的人
It's someone with a power.

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,660
你好吗 朋友
All right, mate.

13
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,130
楼顶上那个是谁?
Who's that on top of the building?

14
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:31,470
或许是你呢
Maybe it's you.

15
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,250
万一咱们都变成超级英雄了呢?
What if we all become superheroes?

16
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,990
你干什么呢?      没...没事
What you doing?        Noth... Nothing.

17
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,490
见鬼 不好意思 我...还以为摸的是他脖子
Shit, I'm sorry, I just... I thought it was his neck.

18
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:07,980
莉亚?
Leah?

19
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,090
我能听见 我知道你在里面
I can hear you. I know you're in there.

20
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:17,190
莉亚!
Leah!

21
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,190
我知道那场风暴的时候你出了事
I know something happened to you in the storm.

22
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:24,990
我自己也出事了
Something happened to me, too.

23
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,870
我一直在参加这个小组...
I've been going to this group...

24
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,950
都是我们这样的人
It's for people like us.

25
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,950
(超能力互助小组)

26
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:39,990
你不用自己承受这一切
You don't have to go through it on your own.

27
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,690
我们可以一起去
We could go together.

28
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:43,920
我都好久没跟你一起了
I miss hanging out with you.

29
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:49,570
打给我
Call me.

男人给矮人的忠告
From man-to-smaller-man,

38
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,190
你永远都过不了对杰茜的这份幼稚迷恋
you're never going to get over this childish infatuation with Jess

39
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:01,110
除非你找到一个特别崇拜你的妞
until you find a girl who looks up at you with little puppy-dog eyes

40
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,290
跟你说
and says the words, 

41
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,310
"你的微型小鸡鸡吃起来好像橘子酱呀 费利"
"Your tiny little cock tastes like marmalade, Finlay."

42
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,170
你看看她 看起来不错
Now, look at her - she looks like a fun girl. Eh?

43
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,270
橘子酱小妞!
Lady Marmalade!

44
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:15,690
有人说 眼泪是最好的润滑剂
Some people say tears are the best form of lubricant.

45
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:16,650
没人会那么说
No-one says that.

46
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,200
噢...天啊      哦!
Oh...Jesus        Ow!

47
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,660
抱歉 我真的...
Sorry. I'm so...

48
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,220
润滑剂!
Lubricant!

49
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,600
那绝对是最好的润滑剂
It's the best form of lubricant.

50
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,220
比眼泪要好...
Better than tears...

51
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,490
橘子酱
...marmalade.

52
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,430
因为那个更润滑...
Because it's more lubricating...

53
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,190
快滚吧!
Just fuck off!

54
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,110
茶?
Tea?

55
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,990
希望能快点开始 我还要工作呢
Hope it starts soon - got work to do.

56
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,100
该死的文书工作 没完没了
Bloody paperwork - never stops, eh?

57
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,420
就是啊
I know.

58
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,260
你干嘛的?      监督官
What d'you do?        Probation worker.

59
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,910
噢 老天爷 对...对不起
Oh, my God, I'm...I'm so sorry.

60
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:00,830
噢 我的天
Oh, my God.

61
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:03,960
我就是想把饼干渣给你弄干净 我喷了你一脸
I was just going to clean the biscuit off. I kind of splattered ya.

62
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,340
好...好吧
O-OK.

63
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,940
我平常不会把茶和饼干喷在女人脸上的
I don't usually spit tea and biscuits in a girl's face.

64
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,540
除非人家自己要求 我不是说...
Unless she's asking for it. I'm not saying...

65
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,460
你要求我这么干...
you were asking for it...

66
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,830
不是的 真不是
No. No means no.

67
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,730
作为一个经常被人说不的家伙
And that's coming from a guy who gets told no a lot.

68
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:24,190
我是说 我不是那种死乞白赖找妞搭讪的人
I mean, it's not like I'm out there, forcing myself on girls.

69
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,880
我也不知道自己他妈的怎么回事
I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me.

70
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,610
真的很抱歉 反正你就别理我了
I'm really sorry. Just don't talk to me.

71
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:29,450
我...我就是个傻逼
I'm...I'm a twat.

72
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:32,580
我是莉亚
I'm Leah.

73
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,580
费恩
Finn.

74
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:39,580
我是费恩
I'm Finn.

75

"Don't Worry Baby" by the Beach Boys

76
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:54,680
* 这感觉一直在我内心萦绕 不知过了多久
# Well, it's been building up inside of me for oh, I don't know how long

77
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:01,510
* 我搞不懂为什么 总觉得哪里会出错 *
# I don't know why, but I keep thinking something's bound to go wrong...

78
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,420
彩色小糖豆啊! 你一直藏着呢吧 费利
Pick'n'mix! You've been holding out on me, Finlay.

79
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,440
小混球
Little bastard.

80
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,090
我知道你在干嘛
I know what you're doing.

81
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:17,710
等一下下!
Just a minute!

82
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,860
是关于杰茜 对吧?
This is about Jess, isn't it?

83
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,720
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

84
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,820
我说你把费恩带去互助小组 让他找妞搭讪
I'm talking about you taking Finn to the support group to hit on girls

85
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,490
你就不会因为喜欢杰茜而内疚了
so you don't feel so guilty about your feelings for Jess.

86
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,160
我反驳你的观点
Well, I refute that.

87
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,940
大概是吧..."反驳"是什么意思?
Or at least, I think I do. What does "refute" mean?

88
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,670
意思是你不承认某些事
It means you don't accept something.

89
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:44,910
对 那我就是反驳
Yeah, well, I refute that.

90
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:45,880
那我去跟费恩说
What if I was to tell Finn 

91
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,880
你为什么急着给他找女朋友?
why you're so keen on him getting a girlfriend?

92
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,130
别 你不能 我真心喜欢杰茜啊...
Don't, you can't. I really like Jess...

93
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:53,500
反正你别搅和我的互助小组了 拜托
Just stay away from the support group, please.

94
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,760
行 不搅合!
Fine, I will! 

95
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,810
我不管你那可笑的互助小组了 亲
I'll stay away from your ridiculous support group, pal.

96
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,860
哎 但我还是你大佬 亲
Oi, I'm still the boss of you, pal.

97
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,630
我反驳
I refute that.

98
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,790
哟 是么? 行
Oh, do you? Well,

99
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:07,500
等我学会了飞行 我要像老鹰一样翱翔天空
when I learn how to fly, I'm going to soar like a friggin' eagle.

100
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,550
我要从高空对准你的头拉一泡大屎
And I'm gonna take a massive shit on your head from a very great height.

101
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,170
那毛衣上的又不是你
It isn't you on the jumper.

102
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,690
你也说不准哦!
You don't know that!

103
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,940
织在毛衣上的东西容易分不清的
It's very difficult getting a good likeness in wool.

104
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:20,020
我不会让你毁了我们所有人的未来
I will not let you screw up the future for all of us.

105
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,790
擦 随便吧
Gah, whatever.

106
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,090
反驳了!
Refuted!

107
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,190
我反驳你 长官!
I refute you, sir!

108
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,640
你说我要不要过去帮他说几句好话?
Do you think I should go over and put a good word in for him?

109
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,070
你准备说什么?
What are you going to say?

110
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,890
我可以说说他那两个奇大的蛋
I could tell her about his strangely weighty balls.

111
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,960
就像... 毛茸茸的大苹果
They're like...hairy apples.

112
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,190
你是亚历克斯么?      对
Are you Alex?        Yeah.

113
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:43,260
有人说你可以帮我
I was told you can help me.

114
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,680
去掉我的超能力
With my power.

115
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,940
说说你的情况
What's the problem?

116
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,030
我会把东西都从里外翻
I turn things inside out.

117
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:51,530
嗯      听起来也不是坏事
Hm.        That doesn't seem that bad.

118
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,050
洗衣服的话就很方便
It's good for doing the laundry.

119
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:54,950
还有变性手术
And transgender surgery.

120
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,640
我把我的猫外翻了
I turned my cat inside out.

121
00:07:58,690 --> 00:07:59,490
好吧...
OK...

122
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,360
我们不如去安静点的地方谈?
Why don't we go somewhere a bit quieter?

123
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,200
好
OK.

124
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,660
你的能力是什么
So what's your power?

125
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:09,930
什么?
What?

126
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:10,860
你的超能力
Your power.

127
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:13,670
之前你为什么去互助小组?      哦
Why were you at the support group?        Oh...

128
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:16,260
呃... 我听力超强
Er...I have super hearing.

129
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,790
那很酷啊
That's so cool.

130
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:22,820
什么?
What?

131
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,910
我说 "那很酷啊"
I said, "That's so cool."

132
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,280
我小声说的 因为你能...      对哦
I said it quietly, because you can...        Right.

133
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,110
但不是随时都行
It's not always on.

134
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,220
不然就吵死了        也对
It gets too loud.      OK.

135
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,440
那你呢? 你有什么能力?
So, what about you? What's your power?

136
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:00,530
我可以意念移动东西 不光是啤酒
I can move other stuff, too. Not just lager.

137
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,980
见鬼!        见鬼 真抱歉
Shit!      Shit, I'm sorry.

138
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,270
我...我该走了

所以...你这一顿假装叫大家去喝酒
So...this whole thing about going for a drink

173
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,460

我们当然能啊! 当然能诚实!

I like you.        Whoa!

Which is really weird, because you can be such a total dick.

233

或者我们就不告诉他 就行啦

想跟我在一起 我们就得告诉费恩
want to be with me, then we have to tell Finn.

241
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:59,850
我不确定啊 就没有一个折中的办法么...
I don't know, isn't there, like, a middle ground where we just...

242
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:01,450
折中到不用告诉他?
where we don't tell him?

243
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:02,250
就...
Just...

244
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,640

小菜一碟 噢!
It's not a problem. Oh!

247
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,210

Ugh!

248
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,070

249
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:15,070
费利来了啊
Finlay's here.

250
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:17,410
女人      在哪呢?!
Women.        Where?!

251
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,000

I'm saying.

252

前一分钟 你还...
One minute, you're...

253
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,750
喷人一脸饼干茶渣 
spitting tea and biscuits in their face 

254
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,840
人家还羞涩可爱的
and they're being all coy and shy

255
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,070
后一分钟 就一副根本不认识你的样子
and the next minute, they're acting like they don't even know you.

256
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,650
我受够了这些破事
I'm done with this bullshit.

257
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:31,400
哎 这是要往哪走? 过来
Wahey, where's he going? Come here.

258

你意思是 所有女人都受够了? 全体么?
You mean, like, done with all women? Everywhere?

Who are you talking about?

262
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:44,450
什么?
What?

263
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:47,250
说我妈呢 浑身一股糕点味儿
Talking about me mum. She stinks of pastry.

264
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,330
天天就唠叨那些玩意
Absolutely hums of the stuff.

265
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,390
或许她荷尔蒙有问题 我也不知道
It's probably her hormones, I don't know.

266
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,380
好吧
Right.

267
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,730

她是唯一适合我的女孩
She's the only girl for me.

270
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,530
听着 仅限咱俩之间 
Now listen, between me and you, 

271
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:00,570
你不用说别的 我就是...
don't say anything, I just...

272
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:02,420
我觉得杰茜有点太淫荡了
I think Jess might be a bit of a cunt.

273
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,150
喔 别那么说!      干嘛不能说?
Whoa, you can't say that!        Why not?

274
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,620
因为她是完美的
Because she's perfect.

She's perfection.

277
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:24,140

Eurgh!

278
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:26,560
噢 老天爷啊!
Oh, God's sake!

279
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,550
那你准备怎么办
So what are you gonna do?

280
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,380
你会告诉费恩你喜欢杰茜么?
Are you going to tell Finn about your feelings for Jess?

281
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,060
你他妈脑子进水了吧
Are you out of your friggin' mind?

282
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,600
我能做的只有一件事了
There is only one thing I can do.

283
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,160
"You Really Got Me" by The Kinks

284
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:52,080
* 女孩 你真让我疯狂
# Girl, you really got me going

285
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:56,140
* 你让我如此疯狂 我已失去了自己
# You got me so I don't know what I'm doing

286
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,080
* 对 你真的让我疯狂
# Yeah, you really got me now

287
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:02,120
* 你让我如此疯狂 我已夜不能寐... *
# You got me so I can't sleep at night... #

288
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,590
* 你让我如此疯狂 我已失去了自己
# ...So I don't know what I'm doing now

289
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,320
* 噢 耶
# Oh, yeah

290
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,740
* 你真让我疯狂 *
# You really got me now... #

291
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,830
费利?
Finlay?

292
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,370
看你的短信
(Check your messages.)

293
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,670
或许会发现一个...小礼物
Might find a little...present there.

294
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,870
是什么?      看吧 好好看看
What is it?        Check it out. Enjoy.

295
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,490
她这是在拉屎么?
Is she taking a shit?

296
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:32,460
她真是费了大劲在狂拉大号啊 伙计
She's taking the Mother Teresa of all shits, dude.

297
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,670
她脸都扭成一团了 怎么这样?
Her face is all contorted - what the fuck?

298
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:35,530
就说啊!
I know!

299
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:37,230
足够让你不再喜欢她了吧
It's enough to put you off her, isn't it?

300
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:39,290
呃 我不能再看了 噢 我的天!
Eurgh, I can't watch... Oh, my God!

301
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:42,800
这下你算是从幼稚迷恋中解脱了
Consider yourself cured of your childish infatuation.

302
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,570
你干嘛发一段杰茜拉屎的视频给我?
Why have you sent me a video of Jess taking a shit?

303
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,680
啊?      对 我也收到了
Eh?        Yeah, I got one of those, too.

304
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,690
我还以为是什么电子贺卡呢
I thought it was one of those e-greeting cards.

305
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:51,220
你们他妈开玩笑吧?
Are you fucking kidding?

306
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,460
糟了!
Shit!

307
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,450
早!
Morning!

308
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:01,850
早啊
Morning.

309
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:03,320
早...早上好 杰茜卡
Good...good morning, Jessica.

310
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,550
你他妈干什么呢? 我的手机!
What the fuck are you doing? That's my phone!

311
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,830
对 我知道 我刚刚解放了你
Yeah, I know, I've only gone and bloody liberated you,

312
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:10,550
让你不再为了发短信而受苦
freed you from the tyrannies of friggin' texting.

313
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,750
现在你自由了 脱下镣铐 摆脱它们
You're free now. Just take off your shackles, get rid of them,

314
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,730
扔进水里
throw it in there.

315
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:17,770
* 自...由... 纳尔逊·曼德拉
# Free-ee, Nelson Mandela

316
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:20,620
* 鞋太小不适合他的脚... *
# Shoes too small to fit his feet... #

317
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:23,860
他应该买其乐的鞋 他们有特宽的 对吧?
He should have gone to Clarks - they do a bit of a wider fit, don't they?

318
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,160
你得给我买个新手机
You're paying for a new phone.

319
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,820
为什么 你没有保险吗? 真见鬼了
What d'you mean, you don't have insurance? Bloody hell.

320
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,950
有的人会说你这样是很不负责任的
Well, some people might call that a bit irresponsible.

321
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,130
你懂我的意思吧
Know what I mean?

322
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,350
但我不觉得 我就觉得你可爱
Not me, I think it's adorable.

323
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,800
我就管这种叫可爱
I call it adorable.

324
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,780
我管这叫他妈的手机没了
I call it not having a fucking phone.

325
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:40,360
可爱!
Adorable!

326
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,720
操!
Fuck!

327
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,500

328
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,280
(拨号中...)

329
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:58,830
(莉亚来电)

330
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,230
你他妈这是干什么呢?
What the fuck are you doing?

331
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,960
你突然又认识我了?
So suddenly, you know me again?

332
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:23,400
哎 你得看看这个
Oi - you need to see this.

333
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,910
对 我知道      网上传开了
Yeah, I know.        It's all over the internet.

334
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:28,860
不是吧! 我操!
No! Fuck!

335
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,340
这下搬石头砸脚了 费利
The shit's hit the fan, Finlay.

336
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,510
石头是指他妈的万维网
By fan, I mean fuckin' World Wide Web.

337
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,580
咱们回头见      你去哪?
I'll see you later.        Where are you going?

338
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,390
去找莉亚
To see Leah.

339
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,750
我在互助小组认识的那个女孩
The girl I met at the support group.

340
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,100
真的吗? 那太好了
You are? That's brilliant.

341
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,360
快去吧 快点
Get gone. Go on.

342
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,170
知道么 那天晚上我看到他和她一起出了酒吧
You know, I saw him coming out of the bar with her the other night

343
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:47,520
而且她好像尿裤子了
and she looked like she pissed herself.

344
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,460
或是她下面太湿 然后就...
Or maybe her vagina had become so moist, it just...

345
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,670
从衣服里渗出来了?
..soaked through her clothing?

346
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,390
怎么可能发生过那种事?
And when has that ever happened?

347
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,700
2006年夏天 莉莎·金

春天里股股流淌的小溪

* 失去你...而那更糟了... *

* 我只是看不到未来

* 除非我们懂得了责任

* 我们无法在一起

* 除非我们明白 我们彼此相像

* 你可曾爱过不该爱的人...

你在我家

我在走廊里发现你晕倒了

我想你一定是出了意外
I think you must have been in an accident.

369

I don't know what happened.        You're OK.

不认识
No!

374
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:36,180
不过好奇怪 我也感觉我认识你
But it's weird, because I feel like I know you, too.

375
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,250
我...我该走了
I-I should go.

376

还得去捡垃圾

Don't.

390
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:21,710
你玩够了吧 派对结束我要走了
You've had your fun, the party's over and I'm leaving.

391
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:28,140
滚开!      别!
Fuck off!        No!

392
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:44,830

Wh...?

393
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:49,080
你要不要告诉我这怎么回事?
D'you wanna tell me what's going on?

394
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:52,460
我们在一个虚拟世界里
We're in a virtual world.

395
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:57,010
我们咱俩都转换成了电子信号
I had us converted into electronic signals.

396
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:01,470
我们现在就是一长串1和0
We're just a long stream of ones and zeros.

397
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:04,490
现在有个问题
Here's a question.

398
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:06,960
你他妈干嘛要这么做?!
Why the fuck would you do that?!

399
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:11,830
我喜欢你
I like you.

400
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,220
你根本都不认识我!
You don't even know me!

401
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:14,930
是我
It's me.

402
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,810

在互助小组?
At the support group?

405
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:25,410
你喷了我一脸饼干渣
You spat biscuit in me face!

406
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,620
那个就是我
That was me.

407
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:32,240
我当时... 下载进了我朋友的身体
I was...downloaded into my friend's body.

408
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,340
好吧
OK.

409
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:36,240
我不想把话说得太重
I don't want to get heavy with you,

410
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,760
但我玩够你的电脑游戏了 行吗?
but I'm done with all your little computer games, OK?

411
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,820
我要出去
I want out.

412
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:42,480
游戏结束!
Game over!

413
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,350
我以为你也喜欢我的
I thought you liked me.

414
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,620
就当我比较传统
Well, call me old-fashioned, 

415
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,470
但当你把我变成一串1和0的时候
but you kind of blew it when you turned me

416
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,300
我真没法再有感觉了
into a string of ones and zeros

417
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,830
还把我囚禁在一个虚拟卧室里
and kept me prisoner in a virtual bedsit.

418
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,220
因为这里更好啊!
It's better this way!

419
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,950
我讨厌外面的世界
I hate it out there.

420
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:57,750
你他妈真是个疯子!
You're a fucking nutter!

421
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,310
行 真行
Just great - perfect.

422
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:02,310
我好不容易遇到个真心... 噢!
I-I finally meet a girl that I really... Oh!

423
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,470
什么?
What?

424
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,900
没什么
Nothin'.

425
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,730
你只是需要点时间想想清楚
You just need some time to get your head around it.

426
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:09,290
我已经想过了
I've got me head round it.

427
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:10,520
对 我想我清楚了
Yeah, I think I have.

428
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,240
呃 我要出去!
Er, I want out!

429
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,800
我知道咱们会很开心的!
I know we can be happy!

430
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,020
你去哪啊?
Where are you going?

431
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,930
你不能把我关在这儿!
You can't keep me in here!

432
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,010
放我走!
Let me go!

433
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,840
你不能这样!
You can't do this!

434
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,530
放我出去!
Let me go!

435
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,250
(费恩)

436
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,600
真的很奇怪 我在街区里走着
It was really weird, because I was walking across the estate

437
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,050
所有人都看我...
and people were looking at me...

438
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:56,320
还笑我
..and laughing.

439
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,690
已经发生三次了
It's happened three times now.

440
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:05,040
有个男的盯着我看 满脸笑得巨夸张
This one guy was really staring at me with this big smirk on his face.

441
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,820
噢 真是够了! 操他们
Oh, honestly! Bloody hell.

442
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:11,710
咱们活在多么奇怪 不可预知的世界里啊
What a strange and unpredictable world we all bloody live in.

443
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:13,960
到我办公室
My office.

444
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,470
立刻      好
Now.        Yep.

445
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,430
我想给你讲个故事
I want to tell you a story...

446
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:28,500
好吧
OK.

447
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:33,650
故事是关于一个男孩 渐渐爱上了
This story involves a young man who developed an affection for another

448
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:34,800
另一个男孩
young man.

449
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:38,720
当这个男孩再也无法压抑自己的感情
When the young man could repress his feelings no longer,

450
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,090
他就拍了一段视频...
he made a video...

451
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:45,140
通过诗歌来表达自己的情感
..expressing his desires via the medium of poetry.

452
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:49,450
然后用电子邮件发了过去
And the young man sent the video by electronic mail,

453
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:52,560
或叫e-mail 当时才刚刚有这个东西
or e-mail, as it was to become known.

454
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,480
五分钟后 他的收件箱叮了一声
Five minutes later, there was a ping in his inbox

455
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,050
然后又来一个...
and then another...

456
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,830
接着又一个
and then another.

457
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:08,320
后来才知道是另一个男孩 他并不感同身受
It transpires that the other young man did not share his feelings...

458
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,960
他觉得那首诗很好笑
He found the poem amusing,

459
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,430
就分享给了所有他认识的人
so he shared it with everyone he knew

460
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:15,890
那些人又分享给了他们的朋友 
who shared it with everyone they knew 

461
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:18,140
就这样一直传下去
and so on and so forth.

462
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:22,540
当然这个男孩因为这种残忍的拒绝而痛苦不已
And the young man was understandably upset by this cruel rejection,

463
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,850
于是他去质问他心仪的那个男孩
so confronted the object of his desires

464
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:26,860
在一个没人的地下停车场里
in a deserted underground car park.

465
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:32,480
他带着满脸的泪水...
And with tears streaming down his face...

466
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:35,150
一边背诵着那首诗...
..he recited the poem again...

467
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:41,560
一边把另一个男孩打得血肉模糊
..as he beat the other young man to a bloody pulp.

468
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:46,440
你明白我的意思没?
Do you see my point?

469
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:49,860
不太明白
Not really.

470
00:26:58,190 --> 00:26:59,710
或许这个能帮你明白
Perhaps this will help you.

471
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,650
韩国人的混剪
Korean mash-up.

472
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,780
为什么网上会有我拉屎的视频?
Why is there a video of me shitting on the internet?

473
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:27,880
你在说什么呢?
What d'you mean?

474
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,840
把拉屎这种事传网上?
Making toilet on the internet?

475
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,900
操你丫的 比尔·盖茨! 太过分了 伙计
Damn you, Bill Gates! That's out of order, man.

476
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,260
真不敢相信      是你干的 是不是?
Can't believe it.        It was you, wasn't it?

477
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:39,270
我能不能...你让我...让我跟你解释一下
Can I just... Let me just say... Let me just say in me defence...

478
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:40,520
听着 我们大家都犯过大错
Look, we've all made bloody mistakes.

479
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,930
啊!        我操! 杰茜!
Aaaah!      Fucking 'ell! Jess!

480
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,380
你疯了吗?! 杰茜!
What the fuck?! Jess!

481
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:49,450
操他娘的老天爷啊!
Jesus fucking Christ!

482
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,550
我给你买了披萨
I brought you some pizza.

483
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:03,480
你以为用几片披萨就能得到我的心么
You think you can just win me over with a few slices of pizza?

484
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,150
可悲!
Pathetic!

485
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,530
我一会儿再来
I'll come back later.

486
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:09,530
喔 等等...是什么口味的披萨?
Whoa, wait... What kind of pizza is it?

487
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:10,610
夏威夷口味
Hawaiian.

488
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:20,670
是你要来这儿跟别人聊咱们的问题
You're the one who wanted to come and talk about our issues,

489
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:24,290
而且说明一下 那都是因为你内心脆弱
which, for the record, are all in your weak little mind.

490
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:27,630
但后来我才意识到 这个小组的重要性
But that is before I realised how important this group is.

491
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:28,850
说真的 你知道吗 
Do you know, honestly, 

492
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:31,790
你就像一头在瓷器店里勃起的公牛
you are like a bull with an 'ard-on in a china shop,

493
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,190
真的很荒唐
it's ridiculous.

494
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,780
是不是因为杰茜?
Is this about Jess?

495
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:37,280
我就是...我不知道该怎么办
I just... I don't know what to do...

496
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,250
你一直做好人 做善事 行为高尚
You try and do the good thing, the right thing, the noble thing,

497
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:41,270
你是什么都不用担心啊
and what d'you have to show for it?

498
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:44,110
可我就这么一颗破碎的心和破碎的蛋
A friggin' broken 'eart and a ruptured testicle.

499
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,030
嗯
Hm.

500
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:47,460
咱们回头见      真棒
I'll see you later.      Brilliant.

501
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:54,450
我操
Fuck me.

502
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:56,510
好啊?
All right?

503
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:01,790
千万保护好你的蛋
Don't ever let your testicles get viciously beaten

504
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:03,440
别被人用扫帚把毒打
with a wooden broom handle.

505
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,790
我会记住的
I'll keep that in mind.

506
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:06,000
那就好
Do.

507
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:09,130
那么 我听说了你和费恩那晚在酒吧的事
So I hear you and Finn were in the bar the other night,

508
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:10,800
当时你的胯部
it was all getting a little bit Lisa King 

509
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,550
是不是瞬间莉莎·金了呀?
in the crotch department, wasn't it?

510
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,420
啊?
Eh?

511
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:16,580
股股流淌的小溪呀
The brook does bubbleth over.

512
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,290
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

513
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:19,250
你当然不知道了
Of course you don't know.

514
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:20,910
淑女是不会明白这种话的
A lady doesn't speak of such matters.

515
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:24,180
女士您当时还满意么?
Was Madame satisfied?

516
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,780
不 我说真的 我不明白你在说什么
No, really, I don't know what you're talking about.

517
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,540
我在说女士您
I'm talking about Madame.

518
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,350
和费利大人 我想你能在一个
And Master Finlay, I presume he's to be found

519
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,900
满是他自己体液的池子里找到他
in a pool of his own bodily fluids somewhere.

520
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:32,700
费利是谁?
Who's Finlay?

521
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,420
我的妈 费利就是那个小小的
For God's sake, Finlay is the small,

522
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,990
很善良 跟猴似的那个矮子 你...
well-intentioned monkey-ish little fellow. You...

523
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:39,080
你是... 你是莉亚 对么?
You are L... You're Leah, aren't you?

524
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,150
噢 我明白了 抱歉
Oh, I get it. I'm sorry.

525
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,420
让你难堪了
You're embarrassed.

526
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,760
非常难为情
And deeply ashamed.

527
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,610
眨三下眼睛我就明白了
Just wink three times and I'll know.

528
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:49,760
那不是我
It wasn't me.

529
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:52,430
我想那是我朋友 莉亚
I think it was my friend, Leah.

530
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:55,090
我想是她对我动了手脚
I think she did something to me.

531
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,360
听着 过不了几天 大家就会去嗨
Look, in a couple of days, everybody is going to be going crazy

532
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,180
新出的某个视频了... 
about a new video of a... 

533
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:09,550
什么跳舞小猫 或是...
of a dancing cat, or...

534
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:12,780
或是大灰熊追逐小矮人!
Or the grizzly bear chasing the dwarf!

535
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:15,070
那个太经典了 那小腿儿...!
It's a classic, his little legs...!

536
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,130
总之 我的意思是 没人会记得的
Anyway, my point is, no-one remembers it.

537
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:21,740
显然你就记住了
You obviously remember it.

538
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,750
我觉得你在里面还挺可爱的
I think you looked rather cute, actually,

539
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:26,570
你的脸都扭成了一团
your face all screwed up and contorted.

540
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:28,810
你们能不能就他妈的闭上嘴?!
Will you please just shut the fuck up?!

541
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:31,730
伙计们! 别! 别动手!
Guys! No! Stop!

542
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,070
能不能让我跟你解释一下...
Can I just say, in my defence...

543
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,380
不能 你个傻...!      别!
No, you f...!        Don't!

544
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:37,260
别再打蛋了!
Not the testicles!

545
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,560
老天爷!
For God's sake!

546
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:40,640
我想费恩遇到麻烦了
I think Finn's in trouble.

547
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:46,490
那...这女孩的超能力怎么用?
So...how does this girl's power work?

548
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:48,380
我不知道 她朋友认为
Well, I don't know. Her mate seems to think

549
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,500
是跟电脑有关的
it's something to do with computers

550
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,330
然后把自己植入别人体内
and friggin' inserting yourself into people.

551
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:53,780
我也不太明白 但她抓了咱们的小猴子
I don't really understand it, but she has got our little monkey man

552
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:56,500
而我 不能让人拿他做实验
and I, for one, will not let him be experimented on.

553
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,900
除非她把他打扮成...那种黑猩猩什么的
Unless she's dressing him up, man, like one of them chimps

554
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,460
像茶包广告里那样 我就乐死了
in the PG Tip adverts, then colour me amused.

555
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,390
我能不能就跟你解释一下?
Can I just say, in my defence...?

556
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,100
噢 老天爷!
Oh, my God!

557
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:18,800
费恩?
Finn?

558
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,040
噢 见鬼!
Oh, shit!

559
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,810
她把他给杀死了!
She's fucking killed him!

560
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,840
费恩 我都没来得及跟你说
Finn, I never had a chance to tell you,

561
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,310
伙计 是我干的!
dude, it was me!

562
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,240
我偷了你外婆的生日钱
I stole the birthday money from your gran,

563
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,170
但我就是借用一下 伙计!
but I were only borrowing it, dude!

564
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:33,400
我原本要还给你的!
I were going to pay you back!

565
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,510
他有脉搏 他还活着
He's got a pulse, he's still alive.

566
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:39,120
他不需要知道生日钱的事
He doesn't need to know about the birthday money from his gran, 

567
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,620
反正就20块
it was only 20 quid.

568
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,050
他在这里面
He's in here.

569
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:45,660
她把他存在U盘里
She's got him on a memory stick.

570
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,640
这披萨不错
It's good pizza.

571
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,350
我很高兴你能喜欢
I'm glad you like it.

572
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:55,090
但这不代表我会留下
This doesn't mean I want to stay here.

573
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,270
这根本都不是真的
It's not even real.

574
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:01,870
就是一堆1和0
It's just ones and zeros.

575
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,410
这也根本不是真的凤梨罐头 对么?
This isn't even real tinned pineapple, is it?

576
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,800
你最后一次出家门是什么时候?
When was the last time you left your flat?

577
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,890
风暴的那天
The day of the storm.

578
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,220
喔!
Wow!

579
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,020
你真该多出去走走了
You really need to get out more.

580
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:24,510
真的!
Really!

581
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,030
我以前也会出去
I used to go out.

582
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,600
但渐渐地 我就...
Gradually, I just...

583
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:32,320
不再出去了
stopped.

584
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:35,940
网络上的一切都更容易
Everything's easier online.

585
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:38,650
你可以随便跟人聊天 想讨厌谁都可以
You chat to who you want to chat to, you decide you don't like them,

586
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:40,190
点一下他们就消失了
one click and they're gone.

587
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,660
永远不用再看见他们
You never have to see 'em again.

588
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,000
他们取笑你
They take the piss.

589
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:46,700
点一下
Click.

590
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:50,820
他们耍混蛋 点一下
They act like a dick. Click.

591
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,550
你让自己丢脸 点一下
You embarrass yourself... Click.

592
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,730
明白么 不像外面的世界 这里是你在掌控
See, it's not like being out there, you're in control.

593
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,810
如果这对你来说有用 那很好
If it works for you, great.

594
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:06,850
可我喜欢外面的世界
'I like it out there.

595
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,740
你就待在这儿点吧 我要走自己的路了
'You stay here and click away, because I'm going to be on my way.'

596
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,200
我们在这儿可以很开心的 我们什么都有了
We can be happy in here, I know we can. We've everything we need.

597
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,150
如果你真的开心
If you're so happy,

598
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:17,990
你干嘛去互助小组?
then why were you at the support group?

599
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:20,410
你何必要去 如果你...
Why were you there if...

600
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:22,090
不想寻求帮助的话?
you didn't want help?

601
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:25,360
如果这样真的好 你干嘛要去?
If this is so great, why were you there?

602
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:26,890
你干嘛要去啊?
Why were you there?

603
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:28,390
因为我孤独!
Because I'm lonely!

604
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:39,980
你当然会孤独
Of course you're lonely.

605
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:43,980
你从不离开你的房子
You never leave your flat.

606
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:48,040
你快劝劝她 费恩
You tell her, Finn.

607
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,570
多愁善感的货
You soft twat.

608
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:51,710
闭嘴 这多美好
Shut up, this is good.

609
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:53,380
生命就在你身上白白流走了
'Life is just passing you by.'

610
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:55,830
真实的生活
Real life.

611
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:58,490
没错 有时是很糟糕
And yeah, it's shit sometimes.

612
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:02,780
但有了这些坏事 你才会去感激美好
But you need the shit to appreciate the good things.

613
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:03,890
就像...
Like...

614
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:06,010
第一次遇到你喜欢的女孩
the first time you meet a girl you fancy.

615
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,260
那种
That...

616
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,680
羞涩的小颤抖
shy little flutter.

617
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,220
遇到你时我就有那种感觉
I had that when I met you.

618
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:22,420
在互助小组 我请你去喝酒
At the support group, I asked you for a drink.

619
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,030
那根本都不是我
That wasn't even me.

620
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,130
是你
It was.

621
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:27,790
那就是你 是你的内在啊
It was you, it was your personality.

622
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:30,420
而且你也比你朋友漂亮
You're prettier than your friend, anyway.

623
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,840
我...不是说她丑...
I'm... I'm not saying, like, she's a munter...

624
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,850
或是...
or...

625
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:36,840
反正你比较美
You're prettier.

626
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,050
我们可以试试交往 在真实世界里
We could give it a try, out there.

627
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:43,930
我喜欢你
I like ya.

628
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:45,490
你这么说只是想让我放你出去
You're just saying that so I let you go.

629
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:48,210
你走了就不会再回来了      不是的!
You'll leave and you'll never come back.        No!

630
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:50,610
如果你也喜欢我 就可以跟我一起留下啊
If you like me, you can stay in here with me.

631
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,150
不 不! 不行!
No, no! No!

632
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,200
费利!

633
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:56,970

634

635
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:58,890
快放了他!
Let him go!

636
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,790
好吧...
Right...

637
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:06,160
见鬼!
Shit!

638
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,830
我想不出好主意了
I'm all out of brilliant ideas.

639
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:12,780
你不知道自己错过了什么
You don't know what you're missing.

640
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:16,990
5英尺4.25英寸的完美之人
Five foot four-and-a-quarter inches of sheer magnificence.

641
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,160

642
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,630
不!
No!

643
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,000
快点 快点 快点 快点

644
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,140

Quick, quick, quick!

645
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:47,290
放进去了
He's in.

646
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,640
那存储卡呢?      我拿了
Where's the memory stick?        I've got it.

647
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:57,920
他的手机!
His phone!

648
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:06,010
好 我们该怎么把费恩从这里弄出来
OK, so how are we going to get Finn out of here 

649
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:07,120
放进他的身体?
and into his body?

650
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,030
这个...
Well...

651
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:10,730
伙计们 算这位小费利走运
Guys, luckily for young Finlay down here,

652
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:12,820
我们这儿有个计算机硕士
one of us has a masters degree in computer science.

653
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:15,390
对 但你又不是真的计算机硕士
Yeah, but you don't actually have a masters degree in computer science,

654
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:18,890
对吗? 你那文凭是从网上下载打印的
do you? You have a fake certificate that you printed off the internet.

655
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:19,940
你是因为拉屎的事故意说我吧?
Is this about the shitting? 

656
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,960
说真的...老天爷
Because seriously... For fuck's sake.

657
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,340
喂?
Hello?

658
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:32,530
解决得相当容易啊
That was refreshingly easy.

659
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:34,310
我感觉咱们越来越上手了 伙计们
I think we're getting better at this stuff, guys.

660
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,500
不如我带他回家 我好好照看他
Why don't I take him home with me and then I can look after him

661
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,700
期间咱们都想一想怎么办?
while we all figure out what we're going to do?

662
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,820
你? 你要照顾他? 你准备怎么照顾?
You? You want to look after him? What are you gonna do with him?

663
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,740
给他洗个澡
Give him a bath.

664
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:46,990
香薰蜡烛
Scented candles.

665
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:49,600
每个人都喜欢香薰蜡烛      嗯哼
Everyone likes a scented candle.        Mm-hm.

666
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:53,250
对 你可以开你的新车送他回去
Yeah, and, um, you can drive him home in your new car,

667
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:54,240
对么?
can't you?

668
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,030
对
Yeah.

669
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:57,640
你买新车了?
Have you got a new car?

670
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,520
保险里有我的名字吧? 老天爷哇!
Am I on the insurance? Oh, my God!

671
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,350
咱们弄个房车吧      把存储卡给我
Let's get a caravan.        Give me the memory stick.

672
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:02,290
我们可以直接开到渡口
We'll get on the ferry, 

673
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:03,560
然后去法国 装一车法棍面包
we'll just go to France, load up with baguettes,

674
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,430
就他妈只管开 伙计们 懂我的意思么?
just fucking drive, guys, you know what I mean?

675
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:08,140
是她 她下载进入了亚历克斯
It's her. She's downloaded into Alex.

676
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,570
听着 我们可以在一起...
Look, we can be together...

677
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,250
我能让他开心
I can make him happy.

678
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:14,980
帅酒保 伙计 说真的
Handsome Barman, dude, seriously.

679
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,000
你还在里面不?
Are you in there at all?

680
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:19,410
啊!      把存储卡给我
Argh!        Gimme the memory stick.

681
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,130
别逼我动手
Don't make me hurt you.

682
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,400
行吧
OK.

683
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,750
老天爷!
Jesus Christ!

684
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,380
快 快 快!
Go, go, go!

685
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,200

Whoa!

686
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:58,110
怎么了?        嘘!
What's happening?      Ssh!

687
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:59,980
他在跟门卫说话呢
He's talking to the caretaker.

688
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,400
所有工种里最高尚的职业
The most noble of all professions.

689
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,900
他一头把他撞翻了! 快闪!
He's fucking head-butted him! Do one!

690
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,180
见鬼!
Shit!

691
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:20,040
是个死胡同!
It's a dead end!

692
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:32,750
我想他已经走了
I think he's gone.

693
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,030
那么... 被钉在地板上
Well...nailed to the floor.

694
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:16,780
头一回啊      对你是头一回
That's a first.        Speak for yourself.

695
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:20,710
我演校园剧时 受难日重现演砸了
School play, Crucifixion re-enactment gone badly awry.

696
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:31,460

00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,160

你好?        嗨!
Hello?      Hi!

你是那个电工女孩 我的二重身正找你呢
You're electro girl, me doppelganger's looking for you.

703
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:13,290
他要跟你谈谈一件毛衣还是什么的
He wants to speak to you about a jumper or something.

704
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:14,410
你们在干什么?
What are you doing?

705
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,410
我...我知道这要求有点过分
I... I know it's a big ask,

706
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:18,440
但有没有可能
but is there any chance at all

707
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,790
你能把我们身上的钉子拔了?
that you could pull these nails out of us?

708
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:24,180
我...正要出去干活 所以...
I'm... on my way to a job, so...

709
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:26,600
"我正要出去干活"
"I'm on my way to a job."

710
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,050
好心的撒玛利亚人发现耶稣被钉在十字架上
That's what the Good Samaritan said to Jesus when he found him

711
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:30,880
他跟耶稣是这么说的吗? 你知不知道
nailed to the Cross, but do you know what?

712
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,180
他给他把钉子取了
He friggin' un-nailed him

713
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:34,660
接着还说"你要不要跟我一起骑上"
and then he said, "Do you want to kip in me stable with that donkey

714
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:37,000
"这头从伯利恒来的驴?"
"from...Bethlehem?"

715
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,650
然后耶稣就说...你知道他说什么吗? 他说
And Jesus said... Do you know what he said? He went,

716
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:41,540
"噢 谢了 伙计 你看见那水了么?"
"Oh, cheers, mate. See that water over there?

717
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,370
"我这就把它变成酒"
"I'm gonna turn that into wine.

718
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,770
"和鱼"
"And fish."

719
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,630
你真是熟读圣经呀 对不对?
You really know your Bible, don't you?

720
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,320
我很看重我的信仰
Me faith's very important to me.

721
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,240
我就操了
For fuck's sake.

722
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:54,720
喔 小心点 小心点 小心点

Don't.        You can do this!

725
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,000
我会陪着你的
I'll be with you.

726
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:16,890
来吧
Come on.

727
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:23,560
别担心 没有什么可害怕的

728
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,290
没人会伤害你的
Nobody's going to hurt you.

729
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:27,040
放开我的小猴子 你这个疯婆子!
Get off my monkey, you crazy bitch!

730
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,030
放开她!      怎么回事?
Leave her alone!        What happened?

731
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:32,570
她把自己植入了你的身体 伙计
She has been inserting herself into you, dude,

732
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:34,640
而且也不是他妈的"我不是基佬"
and not in a fucking "I'm not gay,

733
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,260
"我就只想试一下"那种意思
"I just want to know how it feels" kind of way, neither.

734
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:39,050
我来处理
I'll handle this.

735
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:41,100
她已经被处理好了
I think you'll find she's already been handled.

736
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:43,200
我处理了
By me.

737
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:45,950
在那里面
In there.

738
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:07,110
我能不能解释一下... 别 别动手!
Can I just say in my defence... Just don't, just stop!

739
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:09,520
杰茜! 求你了 你先... 我有些事
Jess! Please, just... There are things

740
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,250

I need to tell you and I just...

741

你必须听我说
You need to listen.

742
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:14,960
关于排便的那件事
The business with the defecation,

743
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,120
也许是个失误... 不 根本就是
perhaps that was an error of... No, it was,

744
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:19,050
因为我的判断失误
it was an error of judgment on my part,

745
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:23,260
但我的动机 是非常真诚和他妈高尚的
but my motives, they were true and bloody noble.

746
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:28,100
看着你内脏都快拉出来的样子
Watching you defecate your guts out,

747
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:30,170
我一点儿都没被吓退
it didn't put me off you at all.

748
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:30,970
完全没有!
At all!

749
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:34,030
没有比这更好的方式来检验男人的真心了
There is no greater test of a man's feelings.

750
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:37,000
我见过了你最他妈丑的样子
I have seen you turn shit-ugly.

751

What?

756
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:17,030
等等 等等
Hang on, hang on.

757
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,440
这不是一夜情 对么? 我是说...
It's not just a one-off thing, is it? I mean...

758
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,170
你会做我女朋友吧?
You are going to be my girlfriend, aren't you?

759
00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:28,460
我会做你的女朋友
I'll be your girlfriend.

760
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:31,760
真的?      真的

761
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:06,340
我... 抱歉我... 呃...

762
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:09,800
上周 你电击我 复苏了我的心脏
Last week, you shocked me and you restarted my heart.

763
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,970
但当时我不是这样 我是个80岁的老头
I didn't look like this, I was an 80-year-old man,

764
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:13,830
还有老年痴呆症
I had senile dementia.

765
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:15,500
那个是你?
That was you?

766
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:18,810
对 我只是...都没机会跟你说声感谢什么的
Yeah, I just... I didn't get chance to say thank you or anything and...

767
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:22,770
谢谢你
Thank you.

768
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:32,780
噢! 不 我能不能...?

I'm sorry to bother you, it's about a jumper.

770
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:38,210
你是不是什么推销毛衣的?
Are you some kind of knitwear salesman?

771
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:40,540
我看到了未来
I've seen the future.

772
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:44,550
我想那或许也是你的未来
And I think it might be your future.

773
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:50,130
那我后来怎么了?
So what happens to me?

774
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:54,070
我想你变成了超级英雄
I think you become a proper superhero.

775
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,540
这个互助小组都是癌症晚期的年轻人

777
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:04,290

It's not fucking fair.

778

让我感觉到自己活着
It makes me feel alive.
