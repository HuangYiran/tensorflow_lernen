1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,856
格林 前情提要
Previously on Grimm.

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:03,058
他们自称格物生物
They call themselves Wesen.

3
00:00:03,722 --> 00:00:05,335
相信我 他们真实存在
Believe me, they're out there.

4
00:00:05,357 --> 00:00:08,848
- 你看得到他们  - 当他们发怒的时候
- and you see them all the time -only when they are upset and pissed off

5
00:00:10,781 --> 00:00:12,835
他们知道你是格林的后代吗
Do they all know you're one of these Grimms?

6
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:16,449
我觉得他们能感觉到 能认出我
I think they can sense it and recognize them.

7
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,827
一开始 他们就要谋害他
From the beginning, they've conspired by against him.

8
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:27,156
Nick 从我这里夺走一些东西
Nick took something away from me,

9
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,150
所以其人之道还至其人之身
so I took something away from him.

10
00:00:30,714 --> 00:00:31,763
她陷入昏迷
She's in a coma.

11
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:33,243
他们把她从他身边夺走
They've taken from him.

12
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:35,440
- 失去你我也不活了  - 你是谁
- I love you so much. - Who are you?

13
00:00:35,483 --> 00:00:36,590
这不奇怪吗
Doesn't it seem strange that

14
00:00:36,621 --> 00:00:39,020
Juliette就不记得你是谁
the only thing Juliette doesn't remember is you?

15
00:00:39,045 --> 00:00:40,962
也许这就是Adalind所计划的
Maybe that was Adalind's plan all along.

16
00:00:41,384 --> 00:00:43,729
但是他们还是没有获得最重要的东西
But they yet to get what matters most.

17
00:00:43,747 --> 00:00:45,963
保管好这个 用生命去守护它
Never lose this. Guard it with your life.

18
00:00:46,203 --> 00:00:48,120
是警监把Juliette救醒的
The captain is the one who woke Juliette up.

19
00:00:48,158 --> 00:00:49,377
是他救了你
He saved your life.

20
00:00:49,396 --> 00:00:50,340
你想要我做什么
What do you want from me?

21
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,144
如果抛开彼此成见 我们可以干一番大事业
If you and I can overcome our differences, we will make history.

22
00:00:53,318 --> 00:00:54,908
- 你相信他  - 我不知道
- You trust him? - I don't know.

23
00:00:54,952 --> 00:00:57,480
Juliette记得关于拖车的事情
Juliette remembered seeing you in the trailer.

24
00:00:57,556 --> 00:00:59,273
你认为我的记忆正在恢复吗
You think my memory is coming back?

25
00:01:03,095 --> 00:01:06,850
汝命殁于此 吾于林中孤身静默 弃之

26
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:19,575
你从十三世纪的君士坦丁堡里
What did you take from Constantinople

27
00:01:19,606 --> 00:01:22,147
拿了什么重要的东西
in the 13th century that was so damn important?

28
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,110
你到底埋了什么东西
What the hell did you bury?

29
00:01:58,307 --> 00:01:58,966
见鬼
Damn.

30
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,375
我操
What the hell?

31
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,640
不是吧
Are you kidding me?

32
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,360
John
John?

33
00:02:49,261 --> 00:02:51,501
哦 苍天 哦 佛祖
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

34
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,729
重要的是 我老爸非常的传统 好吗
Bottom line, my dad was very old-school, okay?

35
00:03:27,747 --> 00:03:30,178
- 是非一般的传统  - 你老爸还在打猎
- I mean, very old-school. - Your dad still hunts?

36
00:03:30,203 --> 00:03:30,810
不了
No.

37
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:31,636
好吧 让我换种方式和你说
Well, let me put it this way.

38
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,981
我不问 他也知道最好不要和我说这个
I don't ask and he knows better than to talk to me about it.

39
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:35,821
但是晚餐不会自己上门
But they're not getting any meals on wheels,

40
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:36,381
我就只说这么多
I'll tell you that much.

41
00:03:36,406 --> 00:03:37,230
那你母亲呢
What about your mom?

42
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:38,738
再次申明 我不是很清楚
Well, again, I don't know for sure,

43
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,572
但是她不会让他一个人在外面瞎晃荡的
but she doesn't let him go anywhere by himself.

44
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,280
特别是晚上 因为他找不到
Especially at night, because he's not also great

45
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,480
回家的路
about finding his way home.

46
00:03:44,978 --> 00:03:46,410
他们还住在你小时候住的房子吗
Do they still live in the same house you grew up in?

47
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,178
是滴 半月湖 新罕布什尔州
They do. Half moon lake, New Hampshire.

48
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,815
原来的镇 原来的街
Same town, same street.

49
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,732
原来的那个配有三居室肮脏简陋像狼窝的小房子
Same three-bedroom with a large, kind of den house

50
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,929
房屋后面就是国家森林 懂吗
that backs up against the state forest, you know?

51
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:55,821
方便进出
For easy access.

52
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:58,196
但是问题是 他们  他们想我
But the problem is, really, they just... they miss me

53
00:03:58,233 --> 00:03:59,858
想出来与子同乐几周
and they want to come out and spend a couple of weeks.

54
00:04:00,252 --> 00:04:01,390
这有什么问题
What's wrong with that, huh?

55
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,544
没事 只是他们从没有住过酒店
Nothing. It's just, they never stay in a hotel.

56
00:04:03,575 --> 00:04:05,403
他们想我和住一起 你知道现在有点不方便
They always stay here and right now it's kind of awkward,

57
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:05,901
因为
because...

58
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,024
是的 Nick要和你爸妈共处一室
oh, right. Nick and your parents under the same roof.

59
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:08,713
是啊 这就是问题所在
Yeah, that would be a problem.

60
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,766
是滴 我的意思是说 主要是
Yeah, I mean, bottom line,

61
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:11,507
我不想Nick把我父母给杀了
I don't want Nick to kill my parents.

62
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,458
并不是说 他们不会给他很多理由去做这件事
Not that they wouldn't give him plenty of reasons.

63
00:04:14,486 --> 00:04:15,932
我相信Nick会理解的 好吗
I bet Nick would understand, right?

64
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,778
只是当你爸妈来的时候让他搬出去一阵子
Just move out while they're here?

65
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,273
他可以和Hank住一段时间 或者和我
He could stay with Hank or even me.

66
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:20,172
是啊 可能吧
Yeah, maybe.

67
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,772
就目前形势来看
It's just that the way things are going right now,

68
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:23,852
我不认为 没有我的帮助 Nick可以撑下去
I'm not sure Nick could do without my help for that long.

69
00:04:24,061 --> 00:04:25,649
他有说起过Juliette吗
Has he said anything about Juliette?

70
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,772
米有 但是 在我看来
No, not much, but it doesn't look to me

71
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,827
短时间内他俩呆不到一块去
like they're gonna be getting together anytime soon.

72
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,849
嘿 谁知道呢 情侣之间的关系总是变化莫测的
Well, hey, you never know. Relationships are unpredictable.

73
00:04:46,873 --> 00:04:47,800
Monroe 你在楼上吗
Monroe, you up?

74
00:04:49,273 --> 00:04:52,700
嗨 Monroe 你在家吗 我需要你的帮助
Hey, Monroe! You home? I need your help!

75
00:04:53,415 --> 00:04:56,080
喔 你们在这呢 嗨  Rosalee
Oh, there you are. Hi, Rosalee.

76
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,156
你好
Hello.

77
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,904
我打扰到你们了吗
Um, this is me intruding, isn't it?

78
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:19,273
我现在就回房
I'm going to my room now.

79
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,590
- 等下 Nick 如果你需要Monroe的  - 不 不
- Nick, wait, if you need Monroe's... - No, no.

80
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:25,630
不急 不急着说
No. This can wait.

81
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,043
- 喔  - 懂我的意思了吧
- Oh. - See what I mean?

82
00:05:30,295 --> 00:05:31,113
我想你是对的
I think you're right.

83
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,273
让你父母现在过来
It's probably not the best idea

84
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,726
可能不是个好主意
to have your parents come out right now.

85
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,073
我们明天晚上继续这事吧
Why don't we try this again tomorrow night?

86
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,941
- 在我那  - 一定到
- At my place. -I'll be there.

87
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:05,452
说吧 虾米事情
So... Problem?

88
00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:08,726
对不起 Monroe
Sorry, Monroe.

89
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,716
但是你俩发展得挺顺利的
But it looks like things are going really well with you two.

90
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:15,218
是滴 火花四射啊
Yeah. I mean, they're actually going amazing.

91
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,689
所以某时候一些小小的打扰
So one little interruption at just the right moment,

92
00:06:19,144 --> 00:06:20,375
不会是世界末日
not gonna be the end of the world.

93
00:06:21,864 --> 00:06:22,621
你有什么发现
What do you got?

94
00:06:28,418 --> 00:06:30,227
- 我姨妈把这个给我了  - 这是什么
- My aunt gave me this. - What is that?

95
00:06:31,163 --> 00:06:34,640
我猜想 这把钥匙是解开
Supposedly it's one of the keys that locked away

96
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,055
某件重要事情的关键
something very important.

97
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,787
天哪 这把钥匙可是个老古董了
Oh, man. This is really old.

98
00:06:41,218 --> 00:06:45,335
如果你用墨水把钥匙的俩面都拓下来，可以拼成一幅地图
You ink the sides of it... And it makes the piece of a map.

99
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,803
我妈妈告诉我有6把这样的钥匙 而且
My mom told me there are six more of those and that...

100
00:06:50,713 --> 00:06:51,273
嘿 哥话还没说完呢
hey!

101
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:53,156
Monroe 你去哪
Monroe, where are you going?

102
00:06:53,821 --> 00:06:56,510
我想我知道这个 Nick 我知道这个
I think I know this, Nick. I think I know this.

103
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,590
- 钥匙吗 真的  - 不是 地图
- The key? Seriously? - No, the map.

104
00:06:58,658 --> 00:06:59,889
但是这个钥匙很古老了
But the key is very old.

105
00:06:59,932 --> 00:07:01,747
可能要追溯到中世纪时期了
I'd say made sometime during the middle ages.

106
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,880
这些东西最早是在修道院里才用到的
You know, a lot of them were first designed in monasteries.

107
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,510
这个叫做巫师锁 我不是和你说那种男巫师
It's called a ward-lock, and I'm not talking about a male witch.

108
00:07:08,572 --> 00:07:11,864
而是 他们合用一套巫术的东西 把它称为巫师锁
It's a... they use a set of obstructions called wards.

109
00:07:11,956 --> 00:07:13,956
但是我现在对这张地图更感兴趣
But I'm really more interested in the map right now.

110
00:07:16,424 --> 00:07:17,310
好吧
Okay.

111
00:07:19,796 --> 00:07:22,381
这是一张Schwaben的老地图
This is an ancient map of Schwaben,

112
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,273
现在叫做斯瓦比亚 在德国巴伐利亚州境内
which is Swabia, which is in Bavaria.

113
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,781
你看这两张地图多么相似啊
You see the similarities between this map and yours?

114
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,550
你怎么知道这些东西的
How do you know all this stuff?

115
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:34,326
我曾曾曾外祖父
Well, my great-great-great- grandfather on my mother's side

116
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:38,153
在Colmar是一名制图者 是法国东部 洛林的阿尔萨斯
was a cartographer in Colmar, which is in Alsace Lorraine,

117
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,098
就在黑森林附近
which is basically right across from the black forest.

118
00:07:40,116 --> 00:07:40,670
说正题
Anyway.

119
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,680
正题 当德国吞并Colmar 我从他那里继承了很多
Anyway, I inherited a ton of his stuff that wasn't burned

120
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,578
在法国和普鲁士战争中没有烧掉的东西
during the Franco-prussian war when Germany annexed Colmar.

121
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:50,412
我猜想 你的这张地图的制图风格是走的Behaim路线
My guess, this map of yours was drawn in the Behaim style,

122
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,120
可能正好是Schwarzwald (德语中黑森林的说法) 中的一部分
which could put it squarely in the Schwarzwald.

123
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,701
对不起 黑森林
Sorry, the black forest.

124
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,409
你看 山峰排列的方式 还有水流路径
See? The way the hills and the waterways are drawn...

125
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,206
我想说的是 以前的地图也就只能画成这样了
I mean, this is before they could be all that accurate.

126
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,415
所以你是说 这一小块地图
So you're telling me from this little piece of map,

127
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,873
是德国的某个地方
you think it's somewhere in Germany?

128
00:08:02,978 --> 00:08:03,556
是滴
Oh, yeah.

129
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:06,000
我以我曾曾曾外祖父的名义起誓
I'd bet my great-great-great- grandfather on it.

130
00:08:07,046 --> 00:08:08,196
这张地图是用来干什么的
What's the map for, anyway?

131
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,553
可能是13世纪的十字军洗劫君士坦丁堡的时候
It's supposedly crusaders in the 13th century

132
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:15,833
发现的某样东西
sacked Constantinople, and they found something

133
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,135
而这东西力量太强大了
that they considered too powerful to return

134
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:20,310
他们不想把它带给那些资助他们东征的贵族
to the royal families who helped finance their crusade.

135
00:08:21,649 --> 00:08:24,061
而且他们有7个人 都是格林后裔
And there were seven of them and they were all Grimms.

136
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,172
他们一定洗劫了非常重要的东西
They must have sacked something pretty significant.

137
00:08:26,209 --> 00:08:26,898
知道是虾米吗
Any idea what?

138
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:28,215
没人知道
Nobody seems to know.

139
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:31,076
但是很多人想找到它
But a lot of people want to find out

140
00:08:31,095 --> 00:08:32,184
不惜杀人也要得到它
and they're willing to kill for it.

141
00:08:32,283 --> 00:08:32,923
好吧
Okay.

142
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,030
谁有其他六把钥匙
So who has the other six keys?

143
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,350
我不知道
I don't know for sure.

144
00:08:42,061 --> 00:08:43,138
但是有人可能知道
But there's someone who might.

145
00:08:46,172 --> 00:08:47,120
我带你去的 Nick
I took you, Nick.

146
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,550
我带你去David和Ron家聚会的 但是
I took you to that party at David and Roni's, but...

147
00:08:51,636 --> 00:08:53,593
亲吻之前我们在干什么呢
what were we doing before we kissed?

148
00:09:01,883 --> 00:09:03,076
- Juliette  - 你好
- Juliette. - Hey.

149
00:09:03,267 --> 00:09:06,406
- 你看上去心情不好  - 真的吗 很明显吗
- You don't look very happy. - Really? Does it show?

150
00:09:06,695 --> 00:09:07,778
是的 有点
Yeah, a little.

151
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,255
因为Nick吗
Is it Nick trouble?

152
00:09:10,332 --> 00:09:11,655
不 和他毫无关系
No, not even.

153
00:09:11,778 --> 00:09:13,415
是我自己 是我自己的问题
It's ridiculous. I'm being ridiculous.

154
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:16,012
一切都好 我 我们俩进展很顺利
Everything is so good, I'm... we're going great.

155
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,944
我们都非常适合对方
We're just so perfect for each other

156
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,012
但是我们还没有涉及到这个话题
but nobody has said how they feel yet.

157
00:09:20,406 --> 00:09:22,504
噢 你是说你们还没有正式表白
Ohh, you mean in terms of the word "Love."

158
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,969
我可没这么说
I did not say that.

159
00:09:27,655 --> 00:09:30,055
我 我要去续杯
I'm... l'm gonna get a refill.

160
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,163
等会回来
Be right back.

161
00:09:31,686 --> 00:09:32,916
- 嗨 Nick  - 嗨 Roni
- Hi, Nick. - Hi, Roni.

162
00:09:34,184 --> 00:09:36,609
- 嘿  - 你朋友很友善
- Hey. - Your friends are really nice.

163
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,818
太好了 我很高兴你喜欢这里
Good, I'm glad you're having a good time.

164
00:09:39,181 --> 00:09:39,778
我很喜欢
I am...

165
00:09:40,578 --> 00:09:41,353
和你在一起
With you.

166
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,498
我懂了
Oh, I get it.

167
00:09:45,753 --> 00:09:46,738
因为这个传统嘛
Tradition.

168
00:09:47,723 --> 00:09:48,770
我刚把气氛搞坏了
I just ruined the moment.

169
00:09:48,806 --> 00:09:49,950
不 不 你没有
No. No, you didn't.

170
00:10:00,486 --> 00:10:01,883
我是想告诉你 我爱你
I'm trying to tell you that I love you.

171
00:10:05,963 --> 00:10:07,876
很好 因为我也爱你
Well, that's good because I love you too.

172
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,406
大家 看这里
Hey, guys.

173
00:10:40,726 --> 00:10:41,803
谢天谢地 你回来了
Thank God you're back.

174
00:10:44,153 --> 00:10:44,929
快点给我
Give it to me.

175
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,458
- 亲爱的  - 嗯
- Baby. - Mm!

176
00:10:57,501 --> 00:10:59,169
亲爱的 慢点吃
Baby, slow down.

177
00:11:01,076 --> 00:11:01,969
你会噎着的
You're gonna choke.

178
00:11:05,421 --> 00:11:07,649
哦 天啦 你受伤了
Oh, no, you hurt yourself.

179
00:11:07,784 --> 00:11:09,243
我很好 别担心
I'm fine. Don't worry about it.

180
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,778
- 你感觉如何  - 好多了
- How are you feeling? - Better.

181
00:11:13,021 --> 00:11:14,695
孩子在踢我 你摸摸看
The baby's kicking. You want to feel?

182
00:11:24,516 --> 00:11:25,458
太美妙了
That's nice.

183
00:11:25,963 --> 00:11:27,280
你要休息下
You gotta get some rest.

184
00:11:27,975 --> 00:11:29,513
我们明天早上就要离开这里
We have to move in the morning again.

185
00:11:30,036 --> 00:11:31,027
天哪
Oh, God.

186
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,230
我快受不了了
I can't do this much longer.

187
00:11:33,729 --> 00:11:35,273
我以为我们在这里很安全
I thought we were safe here.

188
00:11:35,409 --> 00:11:36,295
我原先也是这样认为的
I did too.

189
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,655
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

190
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,178
Bell Crossing路的Hadley农场
We have an update on the attack at Hadley ranch,

191
00:11:46,209 --> 00:11:47,255
发生一起遇袭案件
Bell crossing road.

192
00:11:47,298 --> 00:11:49,070
已确认一人死亡
Confirmation of one person killed,

193
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,246
畜牧被肢解
livestock mutilated.

194
00:11:50,295 --> 00:11:51,224
法医已经到场了
Medical staging.

195
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,624
农场主称是外星人侵袭
Rancher claims attack was from an alien,

196
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,126
不是违法分子袭击
and not the illegal kind.

197
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:57,636
小心处理 可能有精神方面的问题
Proceed with caution, potential mental health issues.

198
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,027
糟糕
Damn it.

199
00:12:30,843 --> 00:12:32,307
- 我们有麻烦了  - 什么
- We've got a problem. - What?

200
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:34,221
车发动不起来
The car won't start.

201
00:12:34,252 --> 00:12:36,683
可能是电瓶或者启动器坏了 我不确定
It's either the battery or the starter, I'm not sure.

202
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:39,544
-那我们怎么办  -你得呆在这儿
- Well, what are we gonna do? - You're gonna stay here,

203
00:12:39,615 --> 00:12:40,705
休息一会儿
keep off your feet.

204
00:12:41,045 --> 00:12:42,240
我去再找一辆车
I'm going to get us another car.

205
00:12:42,547 --> 00:12:43,835
不要离开我
I don't want you to leave me.

206
00:12:43,907 --> 00:12:45,920
宝贝 我也不想走
Baby, I don't want to go either,

207
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,341
但我们别无选择
but we don't have a choice.

208
00:12:51,629 --> 00:12:52,472
我爱你
I love you.

209
00:12:54,303 --> 00:12:55,296
我们会没事的
We're gonna make it.

210 
00:13:06,151 --> 00:13:08,363
- 我有错过什么事吗  - 算是吧
- Am I late for something? - In a way.

211
00:13:10,861 --> 00:13:12,510
就是说这次和案子无关咯
I take it this is not about a case?

212
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:14,984
这次是有关一把钥匙的事
We're talking about a key.

213
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:23,248
现在说来听听也行
I suppose now is as good a time as any.

214
00:13:23,366 --> 00:13:24,650
我知道有7把钥匙
I know there's seven keys.

215
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:28,310
我知道它们指向一些在13世纪就被埋藏起来
I know they lead to something that was buried

216
00:13:28,824 --> 00:13:29,980
的事情
in the 13th century.

217
00:13:30,767 --> 00:13:31,561
那你知道是什么事吗
Do you know what it is?

218
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:33,540
我所知道的是
What I know is this.

219
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,442
皇室家族现在已经掌握了其中的4把
The royal families have four of the seven keys.

220
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:38,953
你有一把
You hold one.

221
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:41,643
这意味着有两把钥匙仍然下落不明
That means there are still two that are unaccounted for.

222
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:43,985
当7把钥匙的图案
Now when the maps of all seven keys

223
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:47,538
被拼凑起来 我们就能知道
are put together, the location of what it is they buried

224
00:13:47,563 --> 00:13:48,220
他们埋藏物品的具体地点
will be known.

225
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,880
那七位十字军决定欺骗皇室
Those seven crusaders who took it upon themselves

226
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,809
他们是你的先辈
to deceive the royal families, they were your ancestors.

227
00:13:55,262 --> 00:13:58,579
然而 其中有一个背叛了其它六人
However, one of the seven would betray the other six.

228
00:13:58,609 --> 00:14:02,080
他这么做 是因为他受尽了折磨
He did so, mind you, only after severe torture.

229
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,580
所以你的祖先折磨了我的祖先
So your ancestors tortured one of mine

230
00:14:06,397 --> 00:14:07,299
来取得钥匙
to get his key.

231
00:14:09,636 --> 00:14:10,736
那他们怎么得到其余三把的
How'd they get the other three?

232
00:14:11,063 --> 00:14:14,315
怎么说呢 整个过程 以我们现在的标准来看
Well, let me just say there was a lot of bloodshed.

233
00:14:14,806 --> 00:14:15,960
也非常的血腥
Even by our standards.

234
00:14:17,218 --> 00:14:20,370
不过 他们仍然花了600年才取得那三把钥匙
Still, it took 600 years to get three more keys.

235
00:14:21,614 --> 00:14:22,688
那他们为什么要付出这么大的代价
So what's worth all that?

236
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,723
那取决于你相信哪一个神话
Well, that all depends on which legend you believe.

237
00:14:26,793 --> 00:14:28,427
在一个版本中 那里藏着炼金术的秘密
In one, it's the secret of alchemy.

238
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,058
另一个则是长生不老的秘诀
In another, everlasting life.

239
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,153
还有第三种说法 说那里有先知穆罕默德的剑
A third has it associated with the prophet Mohammed's sword,

240
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,400
那剑似乎拥有强大的力量
which apparently holds a great deal of power.

241
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:41,550
最后一种 说那里有把耶稣钉在十字架上的钉子
And lastly, the nails that secured Christ to the cross,

242
00:14:41,575 --> 00:14:43,850
可能还有部分十字架的残片
and possibly some of those pieces of the cross itself.

243
00:14:44,627 --> 00:14:46,370
据说也有极大的力量
They are said to hold immense power too.

244
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:49,891
我们要信这个吗
Do we believe this?

245
00:14:50,049 --> 00:14:52,209
那七名十字军觉得他们所发现的东西
Seven crusaders felt it was worth their lives

246
00:14:52,227 --> 00:14:54,412
值得用生命来守护 以确保不会落入坏人之手
not to have what they found fall into the wrong hands.

247
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:56,070
他们一定找到了足以说服他们自己的东西
I guess they found something that convinced them.

248
00:14:56,108 --> 00:14:57,529
所以现在问题就变成
So the question for us would be,

249
00:14:58,155 --> 00:14:59,682
我们能不相信他们吗
can we afford not to believe them?

250
00:15:01,195 --> 00:15:02,111
也许不行
Maybe not.

251
00:15:03,471 --> 00:15:04,680
但我们要怎么做
But what are we gonna do about it?

252
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,956
目前来说 确保我家人
Well, for now, make sure to keep my family's hands

253
00:15:07,975 --> 00:15:08,640
不去碰你那把钥匙
off your key.

254
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,310
我想你和你家人的关系并不是那么好
So I guess you and your family aren't all that close.

255
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,024
按你的说法 我的家庭
My family, as you call them,

256
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:17,003
可能更希望我没出生
would have been happier had I never been born.

257
00:15:18,055 --> 00:15:20,123
这么说吧 如果我不去招惹他们
Let me just say that if I stay out of their way,

258
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,550
他们也不会来管我
they leave me be.

259
00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:24,110
不过他们也 偶尔 想把我干掉
Not that they haven't tried to kill me on occasion.

260
00:15:24,553 --> 00:15:25,987
那你就准备离他们远远的吗
Do you plan to stay out of their way?

261
00:15:26,116 --> 00:15:27,460
这一定程度上取决于你
Well, part of that depends on you.

262
00:15:27,513 --> 00:15:27,920
为啥
How?

263
00:15:29,432 --> 00:15:30,165
你信任我吗
Do you trust me?

264
00:15:31,403 --> 00:15:33,297
大概和你信任我的程度一样
Probably about as much as you trust me.

265
00:15:35,115 --> 00:15:35,619
请进
Yeah?

266
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:38,840
抱歉打扰了 不过我们接到了一个奇怪的案件
Sorry to interrupt, but we have a weird one.

267
00:15:39,529 --> 00:15:40,635
有点超出了我们的管辖范围
A little out of our jurisdiction,

268
00:15:40,669 --> 00:15:42,020
但郡上要求我们的协助
but county's requesting assistance.

269
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:42,553
是什么事
What is it?

270
00:15:42,849 --> 00:15:45,304
牛遭到肢解 可能还有谋杀
Cattle mutilations, possible homicide.

271
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,153
有意思的是
And here's the fun part.

272
00:15:46,203 --> 00:15:48,030
根据牧场的人描述
The perp, according to the rancher?

273
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,520
罪犯是个外星人
He's an alien life form.

274
00:15:51,804 --> 00:15:52,690
真相等着我们去挖掘
The truth is out there...

275
00:15:53,484 --> 00:15:54,340
波特兰东部
East of Portland.

276
00:15:55,699 --> 00:15:56,616
我们随时可以出发
Ready when you are.

277
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,270
这就是事发地点
This is where it happened.

278
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,206
当我看见John的时候 我知道情况不妙
When I saw John, I knew it was bad.

279
00:16:17,806 --> 00:16:19,641
我只能祈祷他不要死
I just hoped to hell he wasn't gonna die.

280
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,338
我试着把他弄上我的车
I tried to put him on the atv with me and...

281
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:25,138
- 我是Doug Parcell  - Burkhardt 侦探
- I'm Doug Parcell. - Detective Burkhardt.

282
00:16:25,169 --> 00:16:25,852
- 吴警官  - 你好
- Sergeant Wu. - Hi.

283
00:16:26,467 --> 00:16:28,320
这是我们的兽医 Kevin Levalle
That's our county vet, Kevin Levalle.

284
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,662
午夜刚过我就来到了这里
I got out here to the ranch a little after midnight.

285
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:34,050
医护人员对John已经无能为力
Paramedics couldn't do anything about John.

286
00:16:34,808 --> 00:16:36,030
车上有血迹
There's blood on the atv.

287
00:16:37,847 --> 00:16:39,224
看来他遭受了严重的撞击
Seems to me he must have been hit pretty hard,

288
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,304
被推倒在栅栏柱上了
got pushed back into his own fencepost,

289
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,283
背部穿透
pierced his back.

290
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,898
他杀了我的六头牛 还杀了John
He killed six of my cows and he killed John.

291
00:16:45,943 --> 00:16:46,726
我对天发誓
Now, I swear to God,

292
00:16:46,766 --> 00:16:47,752
我不知道那是个什么鬼东西
I don't know what the hell it was.

293
00:16:47,802 --> 00:16:49,239
我以前从没见过
I never saw anything like it before,

294
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,575
但他看起来很像外星生物
but it was some kind of alien being.

295
00:16:52,162 --> 00:16:53,006
他会发光
He was glowing.

296
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,206
然后我看他往那边跑了
And then I saw him run off that way.

297
00:16:55,568 --> 00:16:56,795
昨晚他也是这么和我说的
Same thing he told me last night.

298
00:16:57,826 --> 00:17:00,698
我在想是不是有人穿了某种聚酯薄膜外套
I'm wondering if it's a guy in some kind of mylar coat.

299
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,110
我说的是 他在发光
I'm telling you, he was glowing.

300
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,240
我知道这听起来很不靠谱 但实在
I know how that sounds, but there's no other way

301
00:17:04,264 --> 00:17:05,030
没有别的办法来形容他
to describe it.

302
00:17:05,058 --> 00:17:06,110
这些动物都是他杀的吗
He do this to all your animals?

303
00:17:06,141 --> 00:17:07,975
嗯 开膛破肚了
Yeah. Cut them open.

304
00:17:08,616 --> 00:17:09,941
但不是为了牛肉
But he didn't do it for the meat.

305
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,310
他说的对 没有屠宰迹象
He's right, there was no butchering.

306
00:17:11,341 --> 00:17:13,440
这肯定是某种仪式
It must have been some kind of cult ritual thing.

307
00:17:13,563 --> 00:17:16,335
不 他肯定不是地球上的生物
No. What I saw wasn't from this earth.

308
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,064
如果他往那里跑的话 他会跑到什么地方
What's he run into if he runs that direction?

309
00:17:19,481 --> 00:17:22,114
我的栅栏从这一直延伸至0.75英里远
My fence line is about 3/4 of a mile from here.

310
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,262
- 我们能借用下你的卡车吗  - 尽管用
- Mind if we borrow your truck? - No, no. Go ahead.

311
00:17:36,551 --> 00:17:38,951
好吧 我想我知道他从哪出去的了
Well, I think we know where he got out.

312
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:41,971
不是很优雅嘛 肯定很疼
Not very gracefully. That had to hurt.

313
00:17:49,117 --> 00:17:50,612
看起来有点像蜥蜴的皮
Looks sort of like lizard skin.

314
00:17:51,512 --> 00:17:52,939
那得是一只多大的蜥蜴啊
That'd be a damn big lizard.

315
00:17:54,376 --> 00:17:56,421
我很感激你们所做的事
Well, I appreciate everything you fellas are doing.

316
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:58,089
一旦有进展 我们会打电话通知你
We'll call you as soon as we learn anything.

317
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:00,510
我只是希望你们能找到元凶 不管他是谁
I just hope you find whatever it was that did this.

318
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,095
这就是Hadley牧场吗
This is the Hadley ranch.

319
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:28,307
这就是事发地点 对吗
This is where it happened, right?

320
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:30,615
- 你就是Hadley  - 不是
- Are you Hadley? - No.

321
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:32,818
那你们一定是在调查这起外星人袭击事件了
So you must be looking into the alien attack.

322
00:18:32,849 --> 00:18:34,590
呃 先生 这是警方调查
Uh, sir, this is a police investigation.

323
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,427
我懂 我懂
Oh, I know, I know.

324
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,500
我不会妨碍你们调查的
I'm not trying to get in the way.

325
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:37,925
我只是来帮忙的
I'm just trying to help out here.

326
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,430
比如 你们知不知道
For instance, did you know that these attacks

327
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,110
现在全国已经发生了多起类似事件
have been happening all across the country?

328
00:18:42,401 --> 00:18:44,391
好吧 来 这是我的名片
Well, here, let me give you my card.

329
00:18:44,603 --> 00:18:48,427
George Lazure 外星人猎手 或者 叫我UFO学家也行
George Lazure, alien hunter. Or if you prefer, ufologist.

330
00:18:49,287 --> 00:18:50,756
听着 伙计 你们有拍到照片吗
Listen, guys, did anyone get pictures?

331
00:18:50,876 --> 00:18:52,927
我能出很多钱来买外星人的照片
'Cause I can pay big for an alien photo.

332
00:18:53,144 --> 00:18:54,375
黑白的 彩色的
- - Black and white, color,

333
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:55,858
都没问题 数码的最好
doesn't matter, but digital's best.

334
00:18:56,098 --> 00:18:57,550
我可以和你们分成的
I'm willing to split with you guys.

335
00:18:57,581 --> 00:18:59,620
- 没有照片 抱歉  - 该死
- No photos, sorry. - Oh, damn.

336
00:18:59,876 --> 00:19:01,698
嘿 你们可以对我直接一点
Hey, look, you can level with me.

337
00:19:02,054 --> 00:19:04,665
我们都是同一战线的 真的 保护民众什么的
We're all on the same team, really, protecting the people.

338
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,596
探测过受害者了吗
Was the victim probed?

339
00:19:06,627 --> 00:19:07,970
没有人被探测过
Nobody was probed...

340
00:19:09,969 --> 00:19:10,529
暂时
Yet.

341
00:19:19,137 --> 00:19:23,741
*No, I gotta know*

342
00:19:23,776 --> 00:19:27,923
*If she'll stick around*

343
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:31,866
*When the time comes. Oh!*

344
00:19:31,917 --> 00:19:36,549
*To put my truck down*

345
00:19:36,955 --> 00:19:40,591
*Then further up the road*

346
00:19:40,626 --> 00:19:44,270
*We'll park our home*

347
00:19:58,498 --> 00:20:00,978
这里有蓝色的 灰色的
You got your blues, and your greys,

348
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,323
还有来自仙女座的爬虫
and your reptilians, from Andromeda.

349
00:20:03,895 --> 00:20:06,033
那个 我看见的就是他
That one. That's what I saw.

350
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,424
你做了什么
What have you done?

351
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:20,650
我不想让她认出我
I didn't want her to be able to identify me.

352
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:23,206
她没事 只是昏过去了
She's all right, she's just passed out.

353
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,944
她可能经历了心脏病突发
She might have had a heart attack.

354
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,063
那我们需要一辆车
Well, we needed a car.

355
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,289
我不知道还有什么办法能弄到车
And I didn't know how else to get one.

356
00:20:29,744 --> 00:20:30,453
来吧 我们走
Come on, let's go.

357
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,227
你准备把她就丢在这儿吗
You're just gonna leave her here?

358
00:20:32,252 --> 00:20:33,500
她会没事的
She's gonna be fine.

359
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:36,135
听着 现在我们得考虑你和你的宝宝
Look, we need to think about you and the baby now.

360
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,356
我们办不到的
We're not gonna make it.

361
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:41,747
嘿 嘿 我们可以做到
Hey, hey... Yes, we are.

362
00:20:42,378 --> 00:20:44,247
好吗 为了宝宝 你要坚强起来
Okay, you gotta be strong for the baby.

363
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,610
- 这肯定是块皮肤  - 人类的皮肤
- It's definitely skin. - Human skin.

364
00:21:09,886 --> 00:21:11,421
不完全是
Well, not precisely.

365
00:21:11,963 --> 00:21:13,120
如果不是因为刚才停电
You know, I don't know if I would have even seen this

366
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,769
我不确定我是否能看见这个东西
if we hadn't had a power outage.

367
00:21:15,381 --> 00:21:16,812
把灯关掉 我来告诉你是怎么回事
Turn off the lights and I'll show you what I mean.

368
00:21:31,712 --> 00:21:33,420
- 很可爱吧  - 这是啥东西
Pretty, huh? What is it?

369
00:21:33,863 --> 00:21:35,024
萤光素酵素 (拼写与路西法近似)
Luciferase.

370
00:21:35,655 --> 00:21:37,907
你最好能告诉我这东西和魔鬼没关系
Please tell me that has nothing to do with the devil.

371
00:21:38,701 --> 00:21:41,113
这是种掌管生物发光的酵素
It's the enzyme responsible for bio-luminescence.

372
00:21:41,846 --> 00:21:42,830
就像萤火虫那样
Like fireflies.

373
00:21:43,341 --> 00:21:45,624
在很多鱼和海生无脊椎动物里也有发现
Also found in many fish and marine invertebrates.

374
00:21:45,824 --> 00:21:47,137
我们找到它的时候 它并不发光
It wasn't glowing when we found it.

375
00:21:47,257 --> 00:21:50,878
在动物焦躁不安的时候 这种酵素往往会激活
The enzyme usually activates when the animal is agitated.

376
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:53,156
是一种古老的受压反应
The old fight or flight response.

377
00:21:53,556 --> 00:21:57,230
那么 他到底是动物还是人类
So is it animal or is it human?

378
00:21:57,601 --> 00:21:58,334
不知道
I don't know.

379
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,507
这是块拥有动物皮肤反应的人类皮肤
It's human skin with an animal skin response.

380
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,058
Burkhardt
Burkhardt.

381
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,800
刚刚接到郡治安官的电话
Just got a call from the county sheriff.

382
00:22:06,836 --> 00:22:08,120
看起来我们有另一位目击者了
Apparently we have another witness.

383
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,400
他报案称被外星人绑架了
This one's claiming alien abduction.

384
00:22:10,707 --> 00:22:11,968
所以我们说的是宇宙飞船吗
So are we talking spaceship?

385
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,839
不 是辆野马
No. Bronco.

386
00:22:19,144 --> 00:22:21,190
抱歉 宝贝 我们必须继续走小路
I'm sorry, honey, we gotta stay on the back roads.

387
00:22:21,495 --> 00:22:22,344
你还好吗
You all right?

388
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,092
不 你得靠边停车
No! You have to pull over.

389
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,446
我们得开远一点 我们才走了没多远
We gotta make more Miles, we haven't gone that far.

390
00:22:25,464 --> 00:22:26,960
我需要你停车 有些事情不对劲
I need you to stop, something is wrong.

391
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,929
好吧 好吧 好吧
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

392
00:22:33,864 --> 00:22:35,820
- 我能做什么  - 我需要休息
- What can I do? - I need to rest.

393
00:22:36,067 --> 00:22:37,132
我得休息一会儿
I need to rest for a while.

394
00:22:37,267 --> 00:22:38,560
宝贝 你刚才说什么不对劲来着
Babe, you said something was wrong.

395
00:22:38,609 --> 00:22:39,850
如果我不休息 宝宝现在
If I don't rest, I'm gonna have this baby

396
00:22:39,883 --> 00:22:40,880
就会在这儿出生了
right here and now.

397
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,433
那里有间老木屋
There's an old cabin over there.

398
00:22:58,553 --> 00:22:59,570
我有主意了
I've got an idea.

399
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,720
看起来没人在家的样子
Doesn't look like there's anybody home.

400
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,400
我过去看看
I'm gonna check it out.

401
00:23:10,861 --> 00:23:12,810
就要到了 坚持住 坚持住 坚持住
That's it, hold on. Hold on, hold on.

402
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,489
我觉得这里已经很久没人来过了
I don't think anybody's been here for a long time.

403
00:23:28,245 --> 00:23:28,882
好的
Okay.

404
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,138
我们在这歇息一会儿
We'll rest here for a while.

405
00:23:33,433 --> 00:23:34,420
我得去把车藏起来
I'm gonna go hide the car.

406
00:23:35,145 --> 00:23:36,031
Vincent
Vincent...

407
00:23:38,153 --> 00:23:39,510
我又饿了
I'm getting hungry again.

408
00:23:41,175 --> 00:23:41,993
对不起
I'm sorry.

409
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,156
不 不 不 嘿 没关系的
No, no, no. Hey, it's okay.

410
00:23:45,547 --> 00:23:46,647
没关系的 我知道
It's okay. I know.

411
00:23:47,815 --> 00:23:49,464
呃 我去看看能找到些什么
Uh, I'll see what I can find.

412
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:52,190
不过首先 我得生火
But first, I'm gonna start a fire

413
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,470
让这个地方暖和起来
and get this place warmed up.

414
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,603
嘿 话说 Nick不在 对吗
Hey, um, Nick's not here, right?

415
00:24:06,627 --> 00:24:07,390
我没看见他的车
I don't see his car.

416
00:24:07,569 --> 00:24:09,249
呃 不在 据我所知他在工作啊
Uh, no, he's at work as far as I know.

417
00:24:09,267 --> 00:24:10,090
你有试着打电话给他吗
Did you try calling him?

418
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:12,098
不 我不是想找他 我想找你谈谈
No, I don't want to talk to him, I want to talk to you.

419
00:24:12,709 --> 00:24:14,476
你不会还是想回那辆拖车里去吧
You don't want to go back to the trailer, do you?

420
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:16,342
不 我是要和你谈谈这个
No, I want to talk about this.

421
00:24:16,758 --> 00:24:18,862
嘿 这张照片很漂亮
Hey! That's a very nice photo.

422
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,689
没错吧 我说
Right? I think.

423
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:24,898
这是四年前拍的 而且我记得有关这张照片的一切
This was taken four years ago and I remember everything about it.

424
00:24:30,935 --> 00:24:33,144
那就是她 名字叫做 Maureen Rodriguez
that's her. Meet Maureen Rodriguez.

425
00:24:33,187 --> 00:24:36,110
而且在她名下的确有辆红色的78年的野马
And she does have a red '78 bronco registered in her name.

426
00:24:36,529 --> 00:24:38,286
- 我们正在找那辆车  - 她是在哪里被发现的
- We're looking for it. - Where'd they find her?

427
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,510
距离第一个案发现场约两英里
About two Miles from where that ranch hand was killed and the cattle were mutilated.

428
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,947
她走在路中间
She was walking down the middle of the road,

429
00:24:42,966 --> 00:24:44,480
想要拦车
trying to flag down cars.

430
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:46,048
她的确遇到了什么事情
So something did happen to her.

431
00:24:46,088 --> 00:24:47,540
郡治安官对她的描述进行了调查
County sheriff checked out her story,

432
00:24:47,574 --> 00:24:49,576
找到了她声称被带到的那个旧粮仓
found the old barn she said she was taken to.

433
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:53,858
有辆旅行车停在外面 引擎盖开着 车子坏了 没有车牌
Station wagon parked outside, hood up, broken down, no plates.

434
00:24:54,584 --> 00:24:56,230
这可能就是我们要找的宇宙飞船哦
Which probably means that's our spaceship.

435
00:24:56,986 --> 00:24:58,626
我们正在根据VIN (车辆识别号) 确定车主的身份
We're trying to I.D. The owner based on the VIN.

436
00:24:58,665 --> 00:25:00,953
帮我个忙 查查那次牛被开膛破肚的事件
Do me a favor, look into these cattle mutilations.

437
00:25:01,686 --> 00:25:04,756
从哪里开始 然后向哪个方向去了
Where they started, what direction they're going.

438
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:06,584
我们得赶在他之前
Gotta get ahead of this one.

439
00:25:09,184 --> 00:25:10,992
我记得那晚发生的一切
I remembered everything about that night.

440
00:25:11,048 --> 00:25:12,973
我们去的地方 我们做的事
Where we went, what we did when we were there,

441
00:25:12,996 --> 00:25:13,810
那个吻
that kiss.

442
00:25:13,913 --> 00:25:14,880
这是件好事啊
So that's a good thing.

443
00:25:15,206 --> 00:25:17,710
Monroe 我想起我有多么爱他 我可以感受到这种爱
Monroe, I remembered how much I loved him.I could feel it.

444
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:20,708
这难道不是件好事儿吗
Then that's a really good thing, right?

445
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,212
不是吗 为什么不呢
Or no? Why not?

446
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,780
我是说难道这不是你想要的吗
I mean, isn't that what you wanted?

447
00:25:26,824 --> 00:25:29,990
我曾经对他态度很恶劣 我怕我做的事情
I treated him so badly, I'm scared that what I've done

448
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:32,498
会让他不再爱我了
would just make it impossible for him to ever love me again.

449
00:25:32,633 --> 00:25:34,584
听着 在这方面我不是个专家
Look, I'm not an expert in these things,

450
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,676
但关于你和Nick的事儿 我倒是
although when it comes to you and Nick, I'm certainly

451
00:25:37,003 --> 00:25:38,256
比大多数人知道的清楚
privy to more than most...

452
00:25:40,184 --> 00:25:44,264
我要告诉你的是 在我看来
But I just have to tell you, from what I've seen

453
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:47,126
过去这几星期中 没什么能表明
over the past several weeks, nothing suggests

454
00:25:47,163 --> 00:25:50,630
他对你的爱有分毫的减少
that his core feelings for you have faded to any great degree.

455
00:25:50,984 --> 00:25:52,203
我不是很肯定
I'm not so sure.

456
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,363
好吧 只有一个办法了
Well, there's only one way to know.

457
00:25:57,483 --> 00:25:59,003
Juliette 你得告诉他这件事儿
Juliette, you have to tell him.

458
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,813
我想但是我很害怕
I want to but I'm scared.

459
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:03,800
怎么会 你们一起经历了这么多的事情
Come on, after all you've been through?

460
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,073
Monroe 这就是事实
Monroe, that's just it.

461
00:26:05,303 --> 00:26:07,476
我不再是从前的我了
I'm not the same person that I once was

462
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,193
也许这就不是件好事儿
and maybe that is not such a good thing.

463
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,700
但我觉得还不错
Oh, I kind of think it is.

464
00:26:10,781 --> 00:26:12,600
请别告诉Nick我们今天的谈话
Please just don't repeat any of this to Nick.

465
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:14,500
- 我找机会和他谈的  - 好的
- I'll talk to him when I'm ready. - All right.

466
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,418
我会尽力帮助你们的
I'll do anything I can to help.

467
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:18,652
现在就有件事情 也许你能帮我
There's one thing that might help.

468
00:26:18,833 --> 00:26:19,490
说吧
Name it.

469
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,763
告诉我什么是格林
Tell me what a Grimm is.

470
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,587
什么 格林
A... a Grimm?

471
00:26:37,169 --> 00:26:42,100
格林是一种能看见最黑暗世界的生物
A Grimm is someone who can see into the heart of darkness.

472
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,490
能看到其他人所不理解的事物
Someone who sees things other people don't understand.

473
00:26:51,806 --> 00:26:54,003
- 我能看到一些  - 一些什么
- I can see things that... - That what?

474
00:26:54,252 --> 00:26:55,292
大多数人看不到的事物
That most people can't.

475
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,190
那晚在房车里他说了些类似的话
He said something like that the night in the trailer.

476
00:26:58,215 --> 00:26:59,890
就是他把我带到你家的那晚
The night that he brought me over to your house.

477
00:26:59,916 --> 00:27:00,810
恩 我知道
Yeah, I know.

478
00:27:01,303 --> 00:27:03,216
所以你究竟想告诉我什么
So what exactly are you trying to tell me?

479
00:27:06,473 --> 00:27:08,055
我想告诉你 Nick是与众不同的
I'm trying to tell you he's different.

480
00:27:17,976 --> 00:27:21,306
嗨 我拿到你要的残杀牲畜事件的统计了
Hey, I got the stats on the cattle mutilations you asked for.

481
00:27:21,433 --> 00:27:21,910
有什么发现
And?

482
00:27:23,706 --> 00:27:26,000
我把所报告的外星人攻击事件标了出来
I highlighted the reported ufo attacks.

483
00:27:26,393 --> 00:27:28,070
看起来是两周前开始发生的
Seems to have started two weeks ago

484
00:27:28,103 --> 00:27:31,350
在内布拉斯加州的林肯市 后来从那里向西北移动
in Lincoln, Nebraska, then moving northwest from there ever since.

485
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,575
可以看出攻击频率的变化趋势
You can see the frequency of attacks,

486
00:27:33,729 --> 00:27:36,209
总共有27起 随着他们的移动不断上升 
which total 27,increases as they travel.

487
00:27:37,273 --> 00:27:39,303
关于牛和外星人的事儿你查的怎么样了
What is it about cows and aliens?

488
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,569
没查到什么
I got nothing.

489
00:28:15,703 --> 00:28:17,506
- 怎么了  - 你找到他们了吗
- What? - Have you found them?

490
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,963
没有 不过快了 她马上就要生了
No. I'm close. She's ready to give birth soon.

491
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,813
当她分娩的时候 我会到场的
And when she does, I'll be there.

492
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:24,450
已经有四方在出价了
I've got four parties bidding now.

493
00:28:24,486 --> 00:28:26,106
把他们三个一网打尽 我们就发财了
A set of three would be worth a fortune.

494
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,603
我正在努力的做 别再给我打电话了
Yeah, I'm working on it. Don't call me again.

495
00:28:28,689 --> 00:28:30,141
事情做完我会给你打电话的
I'll call you when it's done.

496
00:28:57,723 --> 00:28:58,387
我是Burkhardt
Burkhardt.

497
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:00,130
我拿着实验报告去找过你
Went by your desk with the lab report,

498
00:29:00,163 --> 00:29:01,056
但你不在那儿
but you're not there.

499
00:29:01,218 --> 00:29:02,010
有什么发现
What do you got?

500
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:05,427
在这场穿越全国的牲畜残杀神秘事件中
Something which finally sheds some real light on the mystery

501
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,430
终于发现了些线索
of the cattle mutilations across this country.

502
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,661
- 吴 你快点说  - 是卵巢
- While we're young, Wu. - Ovaries.

503
00:29:10,726 --> 00:29:11,329
你再说一遍
Excuse me?

504
00:29:11,433 --> 00:29:13,010
那人从牛身上拿走的东西
That's what was taken from the cows.

505
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,430
是它们的卵巢
Their ovaries.

506
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,618
- 明白了嘛  - 明白了
- Now you know. - Yes, I do.

507
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:21,938
什么回事
What?

508
00:29:25,603 --> 00:29:26,496
难以置信
I don't believe this.

509
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,086
他们应该早就灭绝了
They were supposed to be extinct.

510
00:29:28,306 --> 00:29:29,706
至少他们是这么告诉我的
At least that's what I was told.

511
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:32,135
这可不会出现在自然历史书里面
Well, that wouldn't exactly be in a natural history book.

512
00:29:32,506 --> 00:29:34,706
不 这些生物有着不同寻常的历史
No, these things have a very unnatural history.

513
00:29:34,733 --> 00:29:36,550
他们理应因狩猎而灭绝
They were supposedly hunted to extinction.

514
00:29:36,703 --> 00:29:39,336
就像水牛一样 他们的皮肤价值连城
Like the buffalo, their skins were considered very valuable

515
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,532
因为其发光的特性
because of their luminescent quality.

516
00:29:41,569 --> 00:29:43,329
他们被收藏家所收集  你真的看到了吗
They were hoarded by collectors. Did you actually see one?

517
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,363
没有
No.

518
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,624
不过有两个人说他们看到了外星人
But I've got two people who say that they've seen aliens.

519
00:29:47,796 --> 00:29:49,260
我还找到了一片发光的皮肤
And I've got a piece of glowing skin

520
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:51,410
这种皮肤不知是人类的还是动物的
that can't be categorized as animal or human.

521
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,800
当我还小的时候 我们常常幻想他们是一种美丽的
When I was a kid, we used to think they were these

522
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:56,903
充满魔力的 会在黑暗中发光的生物
beautiful, magical creatures that would glow in the dark.

523
00:29:57,110 --> 00:30:00,147
如果能看到一个这样的生物是非常幸运的
It was supposed to be really good luck to see one, you know,

524
00:30:00,178 --> 00:30:01,370
就像小妖精的传说
like the leprechaun legend.

525
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,726
对农场主和惨死的牛来说就没那么幸运了
It wasn't so lucky for the ranch hand or the mutilated cows.

526
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:07,009
- 有牛惨死  - 是 有六头
- There were mutilated cows? - Yeah. Six of them.

527
00:30:07,027 --> 00:30:08,600
其他农场上更多
More on other ranches.

528
00:30:09,778 --> 00:30:11,800
给我一点时间 等一会儿
Give me just... wait, one second.

529
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,690
有什么东西被切除掉了吗
Was anything cut out of them?

530
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:14,903
它们的卵巢
Their ovaries.

531
00:30:16,412 --> 00:30:18,449
这种生物不止一个并且她怀孕了
There's more than one and she's pregnant.

532
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:19,132
什么
What?

533
00:30:19,906 --> 00:30:22,010
她靠自己打猎是绝对不可能的
There's no way she's doing the hunting on her own.

534
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,107
这么多卵巢是为了给她 这里 看
That's who the ovaries are for. Here, here, look.

535
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:29,310
萤光怪是一种古老的物种 其起源可以追溯到非洲
Gluhenvolk are an ancient wesen species with roots that go back to Africa.

536
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,384
怀孕的女性在孕期要食用牛的卵巢
The gestating female consumes cow ovaries during pregnancy.

537
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:35,815
我知道听着挺奇怪的 但对她们来说这就像
I know it sounds hinky, but let's just say

538
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:36,972
咸菜和冰激凌一样普通
it's their pickles and ice cream.

539
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:40,190
所以男性萤光怪杀牛只是为了得到它们的卵巢
So he is mutilating cows to get their ovaries

540
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:43,181
给孩子他妈吃
to feed to the mother of his soon-to-be-born child.

541
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,040
对牛的攻击频率越高
The closer the attack on cows are,

542
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:47,250
也就说明了她离分娩的时间越近
the closer she is to popping out a baby Gluhenvolk.

543
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,852
自从它们离开了内布拉斯加州以后 有27起攻击事件
There were 27 attacks since they left Nebraska.

544
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,243
27起 真的吗 她随时都有可能生下小孩
27? Seriously? She is gonna go into labor any minute.

545
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:56,003
Rosalee 你在吗
Rosalee?

546
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:59,190
- 喔 嗨 Nick  - 嗨
- Oh, hey, Nick. - Hey.

547
00:31:00,206 --> 00:31:03,303
我看你们俩正翻书呢
Ah, I see you two have a book open there,

548
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,253
多半意味着有什么可怕的
which more likely than not portends

549
00:31:05,273 --> 00:31:07,650
灾难发生了 反过来
some sort of catastrophic disaster, which in turn,

550
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:09,815
也意味着我和Rosalee的约会又要推迟了
can only mean my date with Rosalee has been put on hold.

551
00:31:09,963 --> 00:31:14,100
Monroe 有一个萤光怪正到处杀牛取卵巢
Monroe, there is a Gluhenvolk mutilating cattle for ovaries

552
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:17,076
因为他妻子肚子里的孩子随时都可能出生
because he has a pregnant woman about to give birth any minute.

553
00:31:17,323 --> 00:31:18,230
说真的
Seriously?

554
00:31:20,073 --> 00:31:22,012
- 萤光怪  - 是的
- A Gluhenvolk? - Yes.

555
00:31:24,904 --> 00:31:26,203
我还以为他们已经灭绝了
I thought they were extinct.

556
00:31:44,209 --> 00:31:45,780
所以说他们正沿路返回
So they're moving along back roads

557
00:31:45,806 --> 00:31:47,800
最后一次袭击牛是在这里
and the last cattle attack was right here.

558
00:31:48,116 --> 00:31:51,800
车在这里被遗弃 那位女士被绑走
The car was abandoned here and the woman was abducted

559
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,701
就在这里的某个地方
somewhere along here.

560
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,938
如果她像我想的一样已经怀孕了
If she's as pregnant as I think she is,

561
00:31:53,956 --> 00:31:55,800
她不能走太远  至少是在这种道路上不能
she can't get very far... not on those roads.

562
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,200
我猜 他们就在这里的某处
My guess, I'd say they're somewhere in here.

563
00:31:58,627 --> 00:32:00,400
不是吗 一条路进 一条路出
Right? One road in, one road out.

564
00:32:00,443 --> 00:32:01,686
她将会需要更多的卵巢
And she's going to need more ovaries.

565
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,956
我好像活在平行宇宙一样
I'm living in an alternate universe.

566
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,744
不 你只是对于你所处的宇宙更了解而已
No, you just have a better understanding of the one we're in.

567
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,403
好吧 我最好还是赶紧出发
Well, I'd better get out there.

568
00:32:09,113 --> 00:32:10,080
Nick 我们想跟你一起去
Nick, we want to go with you.

569
00:32:10,116 --> 00:32:11,906
这有可能是这个种族最后几个萤光怪了
This could be the last of a species, man.

570
00:32:12,206 --> 00:32:13,596
如果可以 我们得去帮助他们
We need to help them if we can.

571
00:32:13,626 --> 00:32:16,200
- 他也许杀过人  - 但孩子是无辜的
- He may have killed a guy. - But the baby is innocent.

572
00:33:20,603 --> 00:33:21,496
我认得那辆车
I know that truck.

573
00:33:21,969 --> 00:33:23,760
这车的主人一直在跟着萤光怪
This guy's been following our Gluhenvolk.

574
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,578
为什么
Why?

575
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,510
他是个不明飞行物研究学家
He's a ufologist.

576
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,372
他也许已经找到他们了 我得进去看看
He may have found them and I gotta find out.

577
00:33:32,403 --> 00:33:33,300
哇 哇 你等会儿
Whoa, whoa, hold on.

578
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:34,800
他可能在里边正睡着呢
He might be asleep in there, man.

579
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,000
你难道不需要个搜查令吗
Don't you need a warrant for that?

580
00:33:41,496 --> 00:33:44,096
你说得对 还是你来开吧
You're right. You open it.

581
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,506
喔 行吧
Oh, okay.

582
00:33:51,766 --> 00:33:52,455
有人吗
Hello?

583
00:34:10,206 --> 00:34:12,000
这是把削肉刀
This is a fleshing knife.

584
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:20,193
噢 我觉得他不是个不明飞行物研究者
Um, I don't think this guy's a ufologist.

585
00:34:22,941 --> 00:34:24,300
Sauver sa peau (法语引申为逃命或保全性命)
Sauver sa peau.

586
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,500
"留下你的皮"
"Save your skin"?

587
00:34:35,243 --> 00:34:36,430
就是字面上的意思
Must mean literally.

588
00:34:40,406 --> 00:34:42,730
如果你把这个东西装入子弹射中一个格林生物的话
If you shot a wesen with this stuff in that bullet...

589
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,793
会要了他的命 知道吗
the bullet would kill him, okay?

590
00:34:45,944 --> 00:34:49,000
但是这个sauver sa peau会将他皮肤保持变身时的状态
But the sauver sa peau would keep him in full woge,

591
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:50,147
甚至在死后也是一样
even after death.

592
00:34:50,506 --> 00:34:51,506
- 永久不变  - 不
- Forever? - No.

593
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,541
是暂时的
This is just temporary.

594
00:34:52,572 --> 00:34:54,290
大概过六或八个小时
You probably have no more than six or eight hours

595
00:34:54,316 --> 00:34:55,600
就变回人类
before you would change back.

596
00:34:56,410 --> 00:34:59,696
所以他不得不迅速地割下皮然后晒干
So he has to harvest and tan the hides very quickly.

597
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:01,806
这里就是他的操作室
He does it right here in his trailer.

598
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:04,700
这个太过分了
This is so wrong.

599
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,743
但这会让人拥有一个完美 已变身的标本用作出售
But you would have a perfectly morphed specimen to sell.

600
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:10,606
我们最好在那个人之前找到那些萤光怪
We'd better find those Gluhenvolk before he does.

601
00:35:10,626 --> 00:35:11,196
怎么找
How?

602
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:13,133
他们正开着一辆偷来的野马牌汽车
They're driving a stolen bronco,

603
00:35:13,944 --> 00:35:15,353
我们在路上没有看到任何一辆
we didn't pass one on the road,

604
00:35:15,415 --> 00:35:16,670
这里也没有地方掉头
and there was no place to turn off.

605
00:35:16,703 --> 00:35:18,340
他们一定在我们前面的某处
They've got to be ahead of us somewhere.

606
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,496
我来拿这些
I'm taking these.

607
00:35:37,603 --> 00:35:38,540
你在做什么
What are you doing?

608
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,406
- 你为什么停下了  - Nick你看到了什么吗
- Why are you stopping? - Nick, do you see something?

609
00:35:41,703 --> 00:35:43,000
我好像看到了一栋房子
I think I see a building.

610
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,273
有人在这里转弯了
Somebody turned off here.

611
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:49,969
闸门被弄倒了
The gate's down.

612
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,366
有人在这儿生火了
Somebody's got a fire going.

613
00:36:00,376 --> 00:36:01,260
你闻到没
You smell that?

614
00:36:07,667 --> 00:36:09,200
这里只有一道轮胎的印儿
There's only one set of tracks.

615
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:11,907
有人进去了 但没有出来
Somebody went in and didn't come out.

616
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:13,303
我们去瞧瞧
Let's check it.

617
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:44,106
Vincent 是你吗
Vincent?

618
00:36:53,413 --> 00:36:54,306
靠  没打中
Damn it.

619
00:37:06,606 --> 00:37:09,603
噢 我的天哪 离我远点
Oh, my God. Oh, get away from me.

620
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:11,090
请你放轻松 好吗
Please, just take it easy, okay?

621
00:37:11,123 --> 00:37:12,676
我们不会伤害你的 我们是来帮你的
We're not gonna hurt you. We're here to help.

622
00:37:12,693 --> 00:37:14,600
Vincent在哪里 你们对他做了什么
Where's Vincent? What have you done with him?

623
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:16,356
你需要告诉我们他在哪里
We need you to tell us where he is.

624
00:37:20,213 --> 00:37:21,113
别伤害我
Don't hurt me.

625
00:37:21,503 --> 00:37:23,503
- 噢 老天爷  - 别伤害我的宝贝
- Oh, my God. - Don't hurt my baby.

626
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:24,750
原来这是真的
It's true.

627
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,600
喔 你真漂亮
Oh, you're beautiful.

628
00:37:28,356 --> 00:37:30,344
离我远点 离我
Stay away from me! Stay awa...

629
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:31,230
啊 好疼
aah!

630
00:37:33,113 --> 00:37:34,356
我想她马上要分娩了
I think she's going into labor.

631
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,110
Nick 我觉得你给她太大压力了
Whoa, Nick, I think you put her over the top.

632
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,646
我们需要很多东西 可是这里什么也没有
We're gonna need a bunch of stuff we don't have.

633
00:37:41,489 --> 00:37:44,090
喔 孩子要出来了 孩子要出来了
Oh, the baby's coming. The baby's coming.

634
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,350
我们完全不会伤害你 我们是来帮助你的
We're not gonna hurt you at all, we're here to help you.

635
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,790
你需要躺在地上
You need to roll onto your back.

636
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:50,541
喔 老天爷 她的羊水刚刚破了
Oh, my God, her water just broke.

637
00:37:51,993 --> 00:37:53,803
- 我们还有多少时间  - 一点也没有
- How much time do we have? - Like, none.

638
00:37:55,495 --> 00:37:57,021
在车里有急救药箱
I've got a first aid kit in my car.

639
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,892
保持呼吸  扶住她的头
Keep breathing. Hold her head.

640
00:38:01,103 --> 00:38:03,306
现在把你的腿慢慢伸展开来 好吗
We're gonna have to spread your legs, okay?

641
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,783
这里 抓着我的手
Here, now just take hold of my hand.

642
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,796
我们一定会成功的
We'll get through this.

643
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:23,000
我需要酒精擦手
I need alcohol wipes for my hands.

644
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:24,816
- 啊 疼  - Monroe
- Ow, ow, ow, ow. - Monroe!

645
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:26,504
她快要把我手弄断了
She's, like, breaking my hand.

646
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,990
- 我做不到  - 你做的很好了
- I can't do this. - You're doing just fine.

647
00:38:29,013 --> 00:38:30,286
- 我做不到  - 你做的非常好了
- I can't do this. - You're doing just great.

648
00:38:30,313 --> 00:38:31,680
你做的好极了 保持呼吸
You're doing great, keep breathing.

Nick, I'm gonna need you to put counter-pressure with your hands on the small of her back.
