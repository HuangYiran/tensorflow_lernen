1
00:00:06,148 --> 00:00:09,276
我们关心的其中主要的事情
就是有个可靠的能源发生器
Reliable power generation is one
of our greatest concerns.

2
00:00:09,318 --> 00:00:12,195
根据这个技术，我们希望很快就可以转换出来
With this project, we hope, soon, to be able to convert

3
00:00:12,237 --> 00:00:15,741
利用我们从星体表层以下捕捉到的压缩热源
and utilize the intense heat trapped
beneath the surface of our planet.

4
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:17,492
也就是地热能
Geothermal energy.

5
00:00:18,243 --> 00:00:19,703
什么，靠这个?!
What, using this?!

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,623
你知道地热能有多复杂么
Do you have any idea how complex geo-thermal...

7
00:00:22,664 --> 00:00:23,665
McKay
McKay...

8
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:26,960
它会产生奇迹效应的
It's gonna work like a charm.

9
00:00:27,002 --> 00:00:29,963
看起来，您有重要的事做, 长官
Looks like you're accomplishing
great things here, Chancellor.

10
00:00:30,547 --> 00:00:32,049
自从上次幽灵出现
Since the last Wraith culling

11
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:34,468
我们一直在努力重建我们的家园
we have worked diligently to rebuild our society.

12
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:37,929
难道你不担心，你们所做的可能再次招来幽灵们的侵袭?
Are you not concerned that your efforts
will attract the attention of the Wraith?

13
00:00:38,013 --> 00:00:38,639
我们也担心
Yes...

14
00:00:38,847 --> 00:00:42,517
但我们不能因此停下发展的进度
but we refuse to let that stop us
from striving to reach our potential.

15
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,479
否则就意味着他们轻易获胜了
To do otherwise would simply mean victory for them.

16
00:00:45,646 --> 00:00:49,316
无论如何，我们现在正致力于开发有效的防御系统
However, we currently are working on a viable defence.

17
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,818
防御系统?
Defence?

18
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:54,321
真的么?
Really?

19
00:00:55,072 --> 00:00:58,200
我们在这里待了两天了，怎么从来没听你说过?
We've been here for two days before you mention that?

20
00:00:58,283 --> 00:01:01,036
我必须先确定你是否可信
I had to learn that you could be trusted.

21
00:01:01,203 --> 00:01:03,580
你是说某种防御武器?
You're talking about some sort of defensive weapon?

22
00:01:03,705 --> 00:01:05,165
你可以这么说
You could call it that.

23
00:01:05,207 --> 00:01:08,418
我们希望依靠这个抵抗下一次幽灵们的侵袭
Something that we hope will protect us
from the next Wraith culling.

24
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,795
你希望再来一次?
So you are expecting it to happen again?

25
00:01:10,128 --> 00:01:10,963
当然
Of course.

26
00:01:11,421 --> 00:01:13,757
如果像历史上那样，幽灵们再次侵袭,
But if the Wraith return as they have historically,

27
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,259
这件事情至少要到50年之后才会发生
they won't be here for at least another fifty years.

28
00:01:16,385 --> 00:01:18,428
50年，你说的
Fifty years, you say.

29
00:01:20,597 --> 00:01:21,974
那武器怎么样?
How about that weapon?

30
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:24,101
是的，是的，过来这边
Yes, yes if you'll just come this way.

31
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:28,397
你还没告诉他们，我们已经把那个幽灵给弄醒了吧?
You haven't told them that we practically
woke the Wraith from hibernation, have you?

32
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,149
嗯还没找到机会
Well... I really haven't had the chance

33
00:01:31,275 --> 00:01:32,484
我们到这两天了!
We've been here two days!

34
00:01:32,567 --> 00:01:34,111
实际上是，一天半
One and a half, really.

35
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:37,447
少校, 他们认为幽灵们50年之内不会再来
Major, they're not expecting
the Wraith for another fifty years.

36
00:01:37,906 --> 00:01:39,783
我们必须让他们知道，这些幽灵随时都有可能出现
We have to let them know
they could show up at any time now.

37
00:01:39,825 --> 00:01:42,119
如果你这么想，你干嘛不告诉他们
If you're so eager, why don't you tell them!

38
00:01:45,414 --> 00:01:47,624
提醒你区域 51, 不是么?
Reminds you of Area 51, doesn't it?

39
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:49,209
大约 1918
Circa 1918.

40
00:01:49,251 --> 00:01:51,670
我认为区域 51 不是在1918左右, 长官
I don't think Area 51 was around in 1918, sir.

41
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:53,547
- 嗯，是的
- 真的!
- Well, the area was.
- True!

42
00:01:53,755 --> 00:01:56,049
我认为这些人们不可能拥有武器
I don't think there's a hope in hell
these people could have a weapon that...

43
00:01:56,091 --> 00:01:59,428
各种大小不同，形状不同的武器, 少尉
Weapons come in all shapes and sizes, Lieutenant.

44
00:02:02,764 --> 00:02:05,892
Sheppard少校, 我想你会发现这个的迷人之处
Major Sheppard, I think you'll find this intriguing.

45
00:02:09,313 --> 00:02:12,441
好，我被骗了
OK, I'm intrigued.

46
00:02:13,692 --> 00:02:14,818
这是什么?
What is it?

47
00:02:15,027 --> 00:02:19,656
一种我们希望将来可以让我们对于幽灵们完全免疫的东西
Something that we hope will one day make
us completely immune to the Wraith.

48
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:24,221
星际之门之亚特兰蒂斯
第一季第7集 完全中毒
Season 1 : Episode 7
Poisoning the well

49
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:32,271
根据 Druhin 长官的说法，这种药物仍然
According to Chancellor Druhin the drug is still

50
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:33,939
需要很长的时间才能研制完成
several years away from being finished.

51
00:03:34,064 --> 00:03:36,566
我早说过了，根据现在的科技水平，那个，嗯,
I'd say, given their current level
of technology, that, er,

52
00:03:36,608 --> 00:03:37,985
仍然处在理论阶段
could be an under-statement.

53
00:03:38,026 --> 00:03:40,946
他们只是觉得他们已经很接近那个突破口了，但事实未必如此
Just because they believe they're close to
a breakthrough, it doesn't mean that they are.

54
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:43,949
你看到了，他们的整个的文明化的进程
You saw for yourself their entire civilisation is

55
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:46,285
是在那个目标完成的基础上的,  McKay博士
based upon the completion of that goal, Doctor McKay.

56
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:48,745
我不会低估他们的
I would not under estimate them.

57
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:52,249
我们可以确定幽灵是个很直接的威胁么?
Do we even know for certain that
the Wraith are an immediate threat?

58
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:55,210
我们可以打赌，他们不需要50年
We can probably bet they don't have fifty years.

59
00:03:55,294 --> 00:03:59,089
后来Sheppard少校慷慨地向Hoffan人提供了帮助
Hence Major Sheppard has generously
offered our help to the Hoffans.

60
00:03:59,923 --> 00:04:00,966
他有么?
Has he?

61
00:04:02,426 --> 00:04:03,218
看,
Look,

62
00:04:04,219 --> 00:04:06,555
实际上，如果他们已经差不多了,
the fact is, if they're onto something,

63
00:04:06,555 --> 00:04:09,266
或者我们可以加快速度
maybe we can speed up the process.

64
00:04:10,559 --> 00:04:11,935
好了, 少校, 走吧
OK, Major, you have a go.

65
00:04:12,477 --> 00:04:14,688
但是，如果这个药只是个白日梦呢
But if the drug really is just a pipe dream...

66
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:17,149
我们的Beckett博士 已经自愿加入我们，半我们找到这个
Our Doctor Beckett's already volunteered
to help us find that out.

67
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,692
哦，他要加入，是么?
Oh, he has, huh?

68
00:04:19,818 --> 00:04:21,445
他会的
He will.

69
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,617
我并不介意帮助他人
It's not that I mind lending people a hand...

70
00:04:26,742 --> 00:04:29,161
- 不，当然不
-你是个大方的家伙，Carson
- No, of course not.
- You're a generous man, Carson.

71
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:30,912
但这是原则问题, 不是么?
but it's the principle of the thing, isn't it?

72
00:04:30,996 --> 00:04:34,416
你不能在还没问过当事人之前，就帮人家做决定
You can't go volunteering someone
for something without consulting them first.

73
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,126
这不是自愿，不是么?
That's not even volunteering, is it?

74
00:04:36,168 --> 00:04:38,503
这是强制
It's being pressed into service.

75
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:40,380
我不得不说，我不是
Not to mention the fact that I'm not...

76
00:04:40,422 --> 00:04:41,506
军人，我不能命令你
not military, I can't give you orders.

77
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:42,382
我知道
I know.

78
00:04:42,424 --> 00:04:44,676
不不不不不, 他只是不喜欢经过星际门
Nonononono, he just doesn't like
going through the Stargate.

79
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,428
他比McCoy博士还糟糕
He's worse than Doctor McCoy.

80
00:04:46,595 --> 00:04:47,596
谁?
Who?

81
00:04:47,638 --> 00:04:50,932
一个电视角色，就像Beckett博士在现实生活中的一样
The TV character that
Doctor Beckett plays in real life.

82
00:04:51,016 --> 00:04:52,726
把人类的身体转化为能量
Converting a human body into energy

83
00:04:52,851 --> 00:04:56,104
然后通过一个神经错乱的血窟窿将它传递数百万光年
and sending it millions of light years
through a wormhole bloody insanity.

84
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,523
C'mon,你多久去一次外星球?
C'mon, how often do you get
to travel to an alien planet?

85
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:00,484
我现在就在一个外星球上面!
I was already on an alien planet!

86
00:05:06,823 --> 00:05:08,575
你干嘛把那些原料都混在一起?
Should you be messing with that stuff?

87
00:05:08,617 --> 00:05:10,452
我知道自己在干嘛， 少校, 谢谢
I know what I'm doing, Major, thank you.

88
00:05:10,535 --> 00:05:14,039
从这些东西的表面来看，他们已经掌握了最基本的生物化学，生理学,
From the looks of things they've mastered
a few basics biochemistry, physiology,

89
00:05:14,122 --> 00:05:16,541
甚至还有一些分子生物学
perhaps even some form of molecular biology.

90
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:19,586
- 相当深刻的考虑
- 这是我们的先人的遗传
- Fairly impressive considering...
- It is our people's legacy.

91
00:05:19,836 --> 00:05:23,131
这个房间展示了这数百年积累下来的医学知识
This room represents hundreds
of years of medical knowledge.

92
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:26,802
我是Perna, 这个项目的主管科研人员
I am Perna, chief scientist for the project.

93
00:05:26,843 --> 00:05:27,678
John Sheppard
John Sheppard.

94
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:31,765
Uh, 这是 Teyla, 和Ford少尉
Uh, and this is Teyla, and Lieutenant Ford...

95
00:05:31,807 --> 00:05:32,391
Carson
Carson.

96
00:05:32,724 --> 00:05:33,767
Beckett
Beckett.

97
00:05:34,226 --> 00:05:34,476
博士
Doctor.

98
00:05:34,518 --> 00:05:36,520
我是说，叫我Carson就好
I mean, call me Carson.

99
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:39,439
我是，嗯， McKay博士, Rodney McKay博士
I'm, uh, Doctor McKay, Doctor Rodney McKay.

100
00:05:44,152 --> 00:05:46,405
我希望我们的设备能帮到你
I hope you will find our facilities suitable.

101
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:47,823
哦，他们很棒!
Oh, they're charming!

102
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:50,117
非常棒!
Perfectly charming!

103
00:05:52,202 --> 00:05:55,497
很久以前，这座城市只是对于我们想象的一个测试,
Long ago, this city was once
a testament to our imagination,

104
00:05:55,664 --> 00:05:58,875
我们创造性的思维，会带来无止境的可能
our creative spirit, to endless possibility.

105
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,252
这是多久以前的事情了?
How long ago was that?

106
00:06:00,335 --> 00:06:02,045
我们是被强迫的，这是真的
It is true that we have been forced

107
00:06:02,087 --> 00:06:03,171
重建很多次，而且
to rebuild many times and

108
00:06:03,213 --> 00:06:04,381
从来没有耗尽我们的潜能
never to our potential.

109
00:06:04,423 --> 00:06:07,175
这就是为什么将这种药物完善如此重要
That is why perfecting the drug is so important.

110
00:06:07,384 --> 00:06:10,929
这比将来仅仅依靠防御武器来对付幽灵重要得多
It is more than just a defence
against the Wraith it is our future.

111
00:06:11,305 --> 00:06:15,517
尊敬的说一句, 长官,你是无法阻止优胜劣汰的，这是生存的基本事实
With respect, Chancellor, you cannot
prevent the culling it is a fact of existence.

112
00:06:15,559 --> 00:06:16,893
我们正在挑战的一个事实
A fact we challenge.

113
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:20,606
我们总是在寻找终止恶性循环的方法
We will always search for a way
to end the cycle of destruction.

114
00:06:20,731 --> 00:06:23,984
幽灵族总是会阻止其他其他发展比较快的种族
The Wraith will always prevent
any race from advancing too far.

115
00:06:24,067 --> 00:06:26,194
你认为你能打败他们?
You figure you can beat 'em?

116
00:06:26,236 --> 00:06:28,363
是的，通过这些知识
Yes, through knowledge.

117
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,885
有很多就像这个一样的成果被隐藏在这个城市的各个角落
A number of archives like this one
are hidden throughout the city.

118
00:06:49,926 --> 00:06:52,095
只有很少的人知道
Their existence is known only to a few.

119
00:06:52,804 --> 00:06:53,388
这是
This is...

120
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:55,098
非常的
very...

121
00:06:55,474 --> 00:06:56,600
令人印象深刻
impressive.

122
00:06:56,934 --> 00:07:00,437
我们特别保存了每一代人留下的成果
We meticulously preserve
the accomplishments of each generation

123
00:07:00,562 --> 00:07:02,731
在他们被幽灵们毁了之前
before they are wiped out by the Wraith.

124
00:07:03,315 --> 00:07:05,609
所以你们所学的东西都是在这儿?
So everything your people ever learned is in here?

125
00:07:05,734 --> 00:07:08,236
还有其他和这个一样的成就
And in other archives identical to this one.

126
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,363
万一他们毁了一个
In case they destroy one.

127
00:07:10,238 --> 00:07:11,823
你们认真点
You guys are serious about this.

128
00:07:12,074 --> 00:07:14,701
站在先人的肩膀上
Standing on the shoulders of our forefathers.

129
00:07:14,785 --> 00:07:17,329
你对这种药研究了多长时间?
How long have you been working on this Wraith drug?

130
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:18,872
150年前,
One hundred and fifty years ago,

131
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:22,292
我们的科学家几乎就要成功的研制这种新药,
our scientists were close to
creating a viable prototype,

132
00:07:22,376 --> 00:07:24,586
可是还没看到结果却过世了
only to die before seeing its fruition.

133
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:26,713
所以你希望,如果这个世界对他们来说不再美好,
So you're hoping that, if this world's no good to them,

134
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:28,423
他们就搬走?
they're just gonna move on?

135
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:31,593
幽灵不会把我们当作是种威胁的
The Wraith cannot possibly perceive us as a threat.

136
00:07:31,677 --> 00:07:35,222
你知道么，老实告诉你吧，我不知道他们会有什么反应
Y'know, to tell you the truth,
I don't know how they would react.

137
00:07:35,305 --> 00:07:39,810
如果他们选择将你们除去，那你会一点办法都没有
If they choose to wipe you
out of existence, you will be helpless.

138
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:42,062
我们不能寄希望于控制他们的行动
We cannot hope to control their actions.

139
00:07:42,145 --> 00:07:43,397
我们做我们能做的
We can only do what we can

140
00:07:43,397 --> 00:07:47,276
就是结束这个进行了太久的循环
to end the cycle that has gone on for far too long.

141
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:52,030
他的名字是Ferrel Mylan
His name was Ferrel Mylan.

142
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:54,032
在他在上次优胜劣汰中死去之前,
Before he died in the last culling,

143
00:07:54,032 --> 00:07:57,160
他是我们这里最有名的医学研究者之一
he was one of our most celebrated medical researchers.

144
00:07:57,244 --> 00:07:59,079
他是创建者之一
He was the one who found it.

145
00:07:59,162 --> 00:08:00,247
创建什么?
Found what?

146
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:01,123
钥匙
The key.

147
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:06,003
他的日记，告诉我们一个男人如何在一次和幽灵的相遇中存活下来
His journals tell of one man who
survived an encounter with the Wraith.

148
00:08:06,295 --> 00:08:10,173
Ferrel Mylan的小组发现这个男人拥有一种特殊的蛋白质,
Ferrel Mylan's team discovered that
this man possessed a unique protein,

149
00:08:10,507 --> 00:08:13,510
一种可以抵抗幽灵释放的化学药物的物质
one that enabled him to resist the
chemical released by the Wraith

150
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,595
可以帮助他们的受害人将毒物排出
to precipitate draining of life from their victims

151
00:08:15,679 --> 00:08:18,932
在反复试验之后
After painstaking trial and error...

152
00:08:19,016 --> 00:08:20,726
Ferrel 制成了蛋白质的翻版
Ferrel made a copy of the protein.

153
00:08:21,643 --> 00:08:25,230
他最后终于可以制成这个药物的原型
He was eventually able to create a prototype of a drug

154
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:27,816
可以用来扰乱幽灵的膳食
designed to interfere with the Wraith feeding process.

155
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:29,151
有用么?
And it worked?

156
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:33,447
Ferrel在这种药物可以用来保护Hoff前被杀了
Ferrel was killed before
the drug could be used to defend Hoff.

157
00:08:33,697 --> 00:08:34,740
现在这成了你的工作
And it's been your job

158
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:38,076
要证明他的努力不是白费的
to make certain his work wasn't in vain.

159
00:08:38,327 --> 00:08:40,162
很大的责任
Quite the responsibility.

160
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:41,955
是很荣幸的
It is a great honour.

161
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:49,546
你如何确信
Ferrel 没有粉饰他的成果,
How do you know for certain that this
Ferrel wasn't just embellishing his results,

162
00:08:49,671 --> 00:08:50,881
或者这只是虚构的?
or for that matter making them up?

163
00:08:50,881 --> 00:08:52,674
我的意思是，你所能利用的只有他的笔记
I mean, all you have to go on are his notes.

164
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:55,844
他和他的伙伴一直工作到最后一刻
He and his team worked until the last possible moment.

165
00:08:55,927 --> 00:08:57,804
他们知道 Wraith的舰队就在头顶上
They knew the Wraith ships were overhead

166
00:08:57,804 --> 00:09:00,015
但仍然在晚上头头的工作,
and still they worked through the night,

167
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,351
希望能找到更有力的发现,
hoping to provide one more insight,

168
00:09:02,392 --> 00:09:05,437
不是为了他们自己
one last thread of knowledge not for themselves

169
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,941
而是为了下一代
but for the generation that would survive.

170
00:09:13,403 --> 00:09:17,574
为了能为他们创造这一点点宝贵的时间，成千上万的士兵们牺牲了性命
Ten thousand soldiers gave their lives
to give them those last few hours.

171
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:22,204
Ferrel's 日记上的最后一句话，所有Hoffans人都知道
The last words of Ferrel's journal
are known to all Hoffans.

172
00:09:23,872 --> 00:09:26,333
我不是冒犯, Perna
I meant no disrespect, Perna.

173
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:29,211
没关系
It's alright.

174
00:09:30,671 --> 00:09:33,173
在那时候，不止是他的日记留下了
More than just his journals survived the culling.

175
00:09:33,507 --> 00:09:36,885
他的研究材料也被保存得很好,
His research materials were safeguarded as well,

176
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:43,475
包括细心保存的幽灵细胞的样本
including carefully preserved Wraith cell samples

177
00:09:43,475 --> 00:09:46,186
我们现在仍然可以利用
which we still use in our work today.

178
00:09:46,979 --> 00:09:47,688
请
Please.

179
00:09:52,401 --> 00:09:53,610
你自己看
See for yourself.

180
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:04,579
哦!
Oh!

181
00:10:07,082 --> 00:10:08,375
简直是难以置信!
That's incredible!

182
00:10:16,341 --> 00:10:18,260
我亲眼看到了, Weir博士
I saw it with my own eyes, Doctor Weir.

183
00:10:18,343 --> 00:10:19,303
是的，在这个培养皿里,
Yes, in a Petri dish,

184
00:10:19,303 --> 00:10:22,556
我们谈论的是150多年前的幽灵的细胞
and we are talking about
a hundred and fifty year old Wraith cells.

185
00:10:22,764 --> 00:10:24,766
我的意思是，他们现在对这些药物已经免疫了,
I mean, for all we know, they could be immune to
the drug by now,

186
00:10:24,766 --> 00:10:26,184
或者找别的东西对付它
or come up with defences against it.

187
00:10:26,268 --> 00:10:27,603
嗯，我不这么想，博士
Well, I don't think so, Doctor.

188
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:29,855
我使用了一点研究人员的特权
I took the liberty of running a few tests of my own

189
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:30,647
使用了一些
using cells taken

190
00:10:30,772 --> 00:10:33,900
Sheppard少校从Athos带回的幽灵的胳膊上个的细胞
from the Wraith arm
Major Sheppard brought back from Athos.

191
00:10:34,151 --> 00:10:34,985
结果还是一样
The results were the same...

192
00:10:34,985 --> 00:10:37,321
几乎可以完全抵抗
near complete resistance.

193
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,489
这其中肯定有点什么
They've definitely got something.

194
00:10:39,531 --> 00:10:41,116
相信我，我比任何人都觉得惊讶
Believe me, I'm more surprised than anyone.

195
00:10:41,158 --> 00:10:42,284
所以你的建议是?
So what do you recommend?

196
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,038
我们将他们的工作推向另一个水准
That we take their work to the next level.

197
00:10:46,121 --> 00:10:49,207
我已经通知了 Hoffans ，我们有客人
I've informed the Hoffans of our guest in the brig.

198
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:52,002
你知道你在说什么么?
You realise what you're asking for?

199
00:10:52,377 --> 00:10:53,754
我知道
I do.

200
00:11:02,012 --> 00:11:03,889
有什么新情况,军士?
Anything I should know about, Sergeant?

201
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,474
没有，长官，他很安静
No, sir, he's been quiet.

202
00:11:06,058 --> 00:11:07,684
还在试图让你看到什么?
Still trying to make you see things?

203
00:11:07,726 --> 00:11:09,144
他已经放弃了
He's given up on that.

204
00:11:10,187 --> 00:11:12,064
我觉得他坚持不了多久
I didn't think he'd last this long.

205
00:11:23,158 --> 00:11:25,619
又见面了, Sheppard少校
Hello again, Major Sheppard.

206
00:11:29,998 --> 00:11:32,209
很抱歉，如果我打搅了你
Sorry if I woke you.

207
00:11:32,501 --> 00:11:35,045
只是过来看看你有什么需要
Just came by to see if there's anything you needed.

208
00:11:35,587 --> 00:11:37,464
杂志，干净的毛巾
Magazine, fresh towels.

209
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:41,510
你没有很好的掩饰你的恐惧, 少校
You hide your fear poorly, Major.

210
00:11:42,052 --> 00:11:44,888
你知道的，我们像这样谈话已经好几个星期了,
Y'know, we've been having these conversations
for a couple of weeks now,

211
00:11:44,888 --> 00:11:47,265
但我还不知道你的名字
and I don't even know your name.

212
00:11:47,891 --> 00:11:49,226
你们也有名字，对吧?
You guys do have names, right?

213
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,228
让我猜猜
Let me guess...

214
00:11:52,688 --> 00:11:53,689
Steve?
Steve?

215
00:11:53,939 --> 00:11:55,190
我是你的死神
I am your death.

216
00:11:55,774 --> 00:11:58,235
你只要知道这个就够了
That is all you need to know.

217
00:11:58,735 --> 00:12:00,654
我更喜欢Steve
I prefer Steve.

218
00:12:06,243 --> 00:12:08,078
你想要什么?
What do you hope to gain from this?

219
00:12:08,287 --> 00:12:12,916
我只是想更加了解你们一些，打破我们之间的隔阂
Just trying to bridge the gap between
our two cultures; get to know you better.

220
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,627
试试看如何让你变温和一些
That and try to figure out how to keep your kind

221
00:12:15,627 --> 00:12:18,755
从上百万无辜的人那里获得生命
from sucking the life
out of millions of innocent people.

222
00:12:18,797 --> 00:12:21,383
就算我告诉你那些你想知道的东西,
Even if I told you what you want to know,

223
00:12:21,675 --> 00:12:24,386
也不会改变什么
it would change nothing.

224
00:12:24,469 --> 00:12:29,725
你的命运和那些阻碍我们的人类一样
You are doomed as are any humans that stand in our way.

225
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,060
没有更好的死法了么?
Can't be a nice way to die?

226
00:12:32,644 --> 00:12:33,437
饥饿,
Hungry,

227
00:12:33,937 --> 00:12:34,938
慢慢的,
slow,

228
00:12:36,148 --> 00:12:39,776
你的食物
knowing your food source is just...

229
00:12:39,985 --> 00:12:41,903
看得见摸不着
out of reach.

230
00:12:43,155 --> 00:12:44,573
为什么把我关在这里?
Why do you keep me here?

231
00:12:44,656 --> 00:12:46,783
我要知道我们将要面临的是什么
I need to know what we're up against.

232
00:12:46,908 --> 00:12:47,826
比如说,
For example,

233
00:12:48,493 --> 00:12:51,747
你们到底有多少这种大的飞船，它们在哪里?
how many of those big hive ships
have you got and where are they?

234
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:54,291
告诉你有什么好处
You have nothing to offer me in return.

235
00:12:56,668 --> 00:13:00,797
或许我们会给你吃的
We could talk about easing your hunger...

236
00:13:01,423 --> 00:13:03,342
Steve
Steve.

237
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,845
你不会牺牲你的同类的
You would never sacrifice one of your own kind.

238
00:13:08,013 --> 00:13:11,099
它们就站在
And yet, it is all that stands between

239
00:13:11,141 --> 00:13:14,561
你和你找寻的那些信息之间
you and the information you seek.

240
00:13:25,864 --> 00:13:29,451
现在我们唯一的资源就是活的幽灵细胞
Using living Wraith cells
is our only recourse at this juncture.

241
00:13:29,701 --> 00:13:33,455
否则我们无法确信这种药物是否有用
Without them we have no way of knowing
for certain if the drug is actually viable.

242
00:13:33,538 --> 00:13:35,707
你说过它
You said it worked effectively on the cells

243
00:13:35,707 --> 00:13:37,584
对我们带回来的那只幽灵胳膊上的细胞是很有效的
of the severed Wraith arm we brought back.

244
00:13:37,668 --> 00:13:38,043
的确如此
It did.

245
00:13:38,752 --> 00:13:41,964
但是它有很多地方已经腐烂了
But those were already in a partially decayed state.

246
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:44,299
我们需要活的样品
We need live samples.

247
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:45,801
如果有新的样品
And with new samples

248
00:13:45,801 --> 00:13:48,095
你就可以研制出药物原型?
you think it's possible to create a prototype?

249
00:13:48,637 --> 00:13:50,389
只要有足够的时间，我就可以
Given enough time, yes I do.

250
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,683
他已经突破了困扰 Hoffans的地方了
He's got a good point
the Hoffans are practically obsessed.

251
00:13:52,724 --> 00:13:53,684
谢谢, Rodney
Thank you, Rodney.

252
00:13:53,725 --> 00:13:54,476
我同意, 博士
I agree, Doctor.

253
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:57,562
但是那对于他们来说或许没什么
But their obsession may become their undoing.

254
00:13:57,771 --> 00:14:00,983
嗯，不管怎样，对我们总有好处
Well, even if they do... undo, it'd be good for us.

255
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:03,151
我的意思是，如果有机会，难道你不想注射这样的疫苗么?
I mean, given the choice, wouldn't you want to be immune?

256
00:14:03,318 --> 00:14:06,280
否则就要成为幽灵的食物
Not if it meant the lives
the Wraith might otherwise spare.

257
00:14:07,155 --> 00:14:11,326
除非每一个人，每一个角落都有这样的免疫力,
This drug would only be of value if everyone,

258
00:14:11,326 --> 00:14:13,829
这药才是真正有用的
everywhere, possessed the same immunity.

259
00:14:14,162 --> 00:14:16,665
这个想法倒是不错
There's a thought worth pursuing.

260
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,582
我同意
I agree.

261
00:14:18,542 --> 00:14:21,670
少校,跟你的犯人有什么新的进展了么?
Major, have you made any progress with your prisoner?

262
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:24,131
没有，他眨了下眼睛
Well, not yet, but he just blinked.

263
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:25,590
眨眼?
He blinked?

264
00:14:25,716 --> 00:14:27,009
这是什么意思?
What does that mean?

265
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:29,261
说明他仍然有把握
It means he's still holding on

266
00:14:29,261 --> 00:14:31,805
他好像暗示说他很快就可以出去了
but he's indicated to me that he may break soon.

267
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:33,223
他告诉你这个，然后
And he indicated this to you by...

268
00:14:33,223 --> 00:14:34,474
眨眼?
blinking?

269
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:35,642
是的
Yes.

270
00:14:36,435 --> 00:14:39,521
没有攻击, 少校,
但是到目前为止，他什么也没告诉你
No offence, Major,
but so far he hasn't told you a thing.

271
00:14:39,563 --> 00:14:40,981
他只是在拖延
For all we know he could linger

272
00:14:41,023 --> 00:14:42,816
拖几个月，然后
this way for months and ultimately

273
00:14:43,066 --> 00:14:44,943
我们仍然什么都不知道
we'll learn nothing.

274
00:14:44,985 --> 00:14:47,654
当我们说话的时候，幽灵们可能已经向着Hoff来了
The Wraith could be on their way to Hoff as we speak.

275
00:14:47,696 --> 00:14:51,408
如果你的犯人对于新药的研制有关键作用,
If your prisoner holds the key
to the creation of this drug,

276
00:14:52,326 --> 00:14:54,494
should we not take advantage of this?
should we not take advantage of this?

277
00:14:54,536 --> 00:14:57,289
我们怎样才能安全的从他身上取得样本呢?
How can we get the sample off him safely?

278
00:14:57,331 --> 00:14:59,833
我们仍然有当时抓住他的武器
We still possess the weapons used in his capture.

279
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:03,128
让他再次束手就擒是件容易的事情
It would be a simple matter of incapacitating him again.

280
00:15:03,462 --> 00:15:04,379
所以，这是可能的?
So, then, it's possible?

281
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:06,214
当然可能
It's possible.

282
00:15:15,349 --> 00:15:16,642
嗨, Steve
Hi, Steve.

283
00:15:18,101 --> 00:15:19,519
再见, Steve
Bye, Steve.

284
00:15:32,282 --> 00:15:33,617
博士
Doctor.

285
00:15:34,785 --> 00:15:35,911
他
Is he...

286
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,080
我是说，你确定他
I mean, you're certain he's...

287
00:15:38,163 --> 00:15:38,997
他已经昏过去了, 博士
He's down, Doc.

288
00:15:39,498 --> 00:15:40,666
做你想做的事情吧
Do your thing.

289
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,675
看起来很无害，不是么?
Almost looks peaceful, doesn't he?

290
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,425
无害?!
Peaceful?!

291
00:15:50,801 --> 00:15:52,928
你简直是昏头了!
You're out of your bloody mind!

292
00:16:05,524 --> 00:16:08,193
我重来没见过这样的设备!
I have never seen devices such as these!

293
00:16:08,652 --> 00:16:09,903
你的工作正在做最后的提炼
The work you've done refining

294
00:16:09,903 --> 00:16:11,738
这种药物应该很快就好了
the drug has been good up til now.

295
00:16:11,863 --> 00:16:15,284
有了这个我们能做得更好
With all this we can make it better.

296
00:16:17,119 --> 00:16:18,078
我觉得,
From what I can tell,

297
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:20,831
你现在最关键的是接种的测试
your biggest problem is that the test inoculations

298
00:16:20,956 --> 00:16:22,207
现在还不能证实
failed to show enough of a presence

299
00:16:22,207 --> 00:16:24,418
这对人体是有效的
in human cells to be effective.

300
00:16:24,501 --> 00:16:26,295
我们需要的是一个更好的传输系统
What we need is a better delivery system.

301
00:16:26,336 --> 00:16:27,045
正是
Exactly.

302
00:16:27,045 --> 00:16:29,923
现在最好是先别管那些关键的蛋白质
And the best place to start
is to recreate the key protein

303
00:16:30,007 --> 00:16:32,175
来看看血清吧
in the serum and work our way up from there.

304
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:32,926
如果我们可以避免
If we can avoid having

305
00:16:32,926 --> 00:16:34,761
它的自我重造,
to re-engineer it from a natural source,

306
00:16:34,845 --> 00:16:37,556
制成一个完全人工的版本,
and make an entirely synthetic version,

307
00:16:37,556 --> 00:16:40,100
这样它的有效性将大大提升
it should ultimately increase the efficiency.

308
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:41,602
这可能么?
Such a thing is possible?

309
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:44,938
只要你愿意努力试试，没什么不可能
Anything's possible if you're willing to give it a go.

310
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:48,817
那还说什么，赶紧开始吧
C'mon then, a bald head is soon shaved.

311
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,529
你和其他人的口音有点不同
You speak differently than the others.

312
00:16:53,905 --> 00:16:55,907
发现了么?!
Noticed that, did you?!

313
00:16:56,325 --> 00:16:57,659
很抱歉如果我把你弄迷糊了
Sorry if I confuse you.

314
00:16:57,659 --> 00:17:01,622
相信我，我的家乡,
这起了很大的作用
Trust me, where I come from,
it all makes perfect sense.

315
00:17:01,747 --> 00:17:02,873
那里什么样子?
What is it like?

316
00:17:02,998 --> 00:17:05,417
苏格兰？哦，那里很美
Scotland? Oh, I think it's beautiful.

317
00:17:06,001 --> 00:17:08,420
但我听说这是一种嗜好
But I'm told it's something of an acquired taste.

318
00:17:08,545 --> 00:17:09,463
我是说你的世界
I meant your world.

319
00:17:10,172 --> 00:17:11,882
那儿一定很和平,
It must be so peaceful there,

320
00:17:11,923 --> 00:17:13,508
因为幽灵不会去
knowing that the Wraith will not come.

321
00:17:13,634 --> 00:17:16,303
哦，你一定很惊讶，那里一点也不和平
Oh, you'd be surprised how not peaceful it is.

322
00:17:18,388 --> 00:17:21,224
人们都很堕落
We're spoiled rotten, now that I think of it.

323
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:23,185
你错过了
You miss it.

324
00:17:23,226 --> 00:17:25,103
对不起，让你难过了
I'm sorry for enquiring.

325
00:17:25,187 --> 00:17:27,230
哦，没关系，没关系，亲爱的
Oh, no, no. Don't be, love.

326
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,034
Perna!
Perna!

327
00:19:18,425 --> 00:19:20,135
所有细胞都渗透了．
One hundred percent cellular penetration

328
00:19:20,177 --> 00:19:21,887
在所有的5次接种测试里
in all five test inoculations.

329
00:19:21,928 --> 00:19:22,763
简直是难以置信啊!
Incredible!

330
00:19:22,888 --> 00:19:24,514
仍然还有很多数据需要分析
There's still a lot of data to be analysed

331
00:19:24,514 --> 00:19:27,225
不过我相信，这个最初的结果是很棒的
but the initial results are very promising, I agree.

332
00:19:27,351 --> 00:19:31,063
Beckett 的努力让这个项目加快发展
Doctor Beckett's efforts
have advanced the project by decades.

333
00:19:31,271 --> 00:19:33,273
Perna的那些公式正在运作着
Perna's formula was right on track.

334
00:19:33,398 --> 00:19:35,901
这是改变了它的分子构成
It was just a matter of changing its molecular design

335
00:19:35,901 --> 00:19:38,153
这样的话，更加便于身体的吸收
so it could be better absorbed by the body.

336
00:19:38,528 --> 00:19:41,073
博士，这对于人民们来说是个巨大的胜利
This is an enormous victory for our people, Doctor.

337
00:19:41,156 --> 00:19:42,532
我不知道该如何感谢你
I don't know how to thank you.

338
00:19:42,658 --> 00:19:43,325
不需要
No need.

339
00:19:43,367 --> 00:19:45,994
当然，这只是初步阶段
Of course, it's only a preliminary.

340
00:19:46,536 --> 00:19:49,206
你什么时候可以开始下一步测试?
How soon until you can set up the next stage of testing?

341
00:19:49,331 --> 00:19:51,833
今天晚点时候我会把进程给您，长官
You'll have a schedule later today, Chancellor.

342
00:19:53,085 --> 00:19:55,045
抱歉，下一步?
I'm sorry next stage?

343
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:56,672
你的报告已经说得很清楚了
Your report makes it abundantly clear that

344
00:19:56,672 --> 00:19:59,716
这个项目正准备进行下一个阶段
the project is ready to proceed to its next phase.

345
00:19:59,883 --> 00:20:03,220
我们想用你的犯人测试一下血清的有效性
We want to test the serum's
effectiveness against your prisoner.

346
00:20:11,403 --> 00:20:13,072
你赞成?
And you support this?

347
00:20:13,197 --> 00:20:14,865
嗯，我知道他肯定是要死的
Well, I know for certain he's gonna die

348
00:20:14,907 --> 00:20:16,408
所以或许我们应该好好利用他
so we might as well make good use of him

349
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,951
当他还活着的时候
while he's still alive.

350
00:20:18,077 --> 00:20:20,204
你真的了解日内瓦协定
You do understand the Geneva Convention

351
00:20:20,204 --> 00:20:24,041
禁止用犯人做科学试验?
prohibits using prisoners for scientific experiments?

352
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:25,834
没有关系，博士，幽灵又没有
No offence, Doc, but had the Wraith

353
00:20:25,876 --> 00:20:28,003
加入日内瓦协定,
attended the Geneva Convention,

354
00:20:28,128 --> 00:20:30,631
他们可能会把这的每一个人都给吃了
they would have tried to feed on everyone there.

355
00:20:32,216 --> 00:20:35,010
Beckett的报告显示，我们还无法确定
Beckett's report indicates that we have no idea

356
00:20:35,094 --> 00:20:37,554
这种药对于人的长期效用
what the long-term effect
of this drug on humans might be.

357
00:20:37,596 --> 00:20:38,931
但是，我们很清楚
Well, we know damn well what

358
00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:41,183
要是幽灵入侵了，我们会怎样，不是么?
the long-term effects of Wraith culling are, don't we?

359
00:20:41,308 --> 00:20:42,726
我们在说的是把一个活人
We're talking about putting a human being

360
00:20:42,726 --> 00:20:45,437
和一个饿得要死的幽灵放在一个房间里
in the same room as a starving Wraith.

361
00:20:46,063 --> 00:20:47,689
一旦我们开始前进
Now once we start down that road...

362
00:20:47,815 --> 00:20:50,150
你觉得我们该怎么走哪条?
Which road did you think we were headed down?

363
00:20:50,192 --> 00:20:51,110
不是这条
Not this one.

364
00:20:52,194 --> 00:20:54,279
至少不是这么快
At least not this fast.

365
00:20:55,155 --> 00:20:59,284
花时间在犯人身上，我不同情他
Having spent time with the prisoner, I don't pity him.

366
00:20:59,451 --> 00:21:01,578
无论如何，他都是要死的
He's gonna die anyway.

367
00:21:04,498 --> 00:21:06,792
这种药将来或许会很有用
This drug could be useful some day.

368
00:21:06,917 --> 00:21:08,293
将来
Some day.

369
00:21:08,585 --> 00:21:12,172
关键是，这样的机会不多
The point is, we don't get
a lot of opportunities like this.

370
00:21:12,423 --> 00:21:14,508
你知道
Do you know how obsessed with this the Hoffans are

371
00:21:14,508 --> 00:21:17,428
当HOFFENS知道我们抓了一个幽灵时有多迷惑?
when they found out we had a live Wraith prisoner?

372
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:20,973
他反正时要死的
He's going to die.

373
00:21:21,473 --> 00:21:22,975
我们试着给他吃各种各样活的东西
I've tried to feed him all sorts of life stuff

374
00:21:22,975 --> 00:21:25,602
但是看起来他只吃一样
but apparently there's only one item on his menu.

375
00:21:26,437 --> 00:21:27,354
测试人是谁?
What about the test subject?

376
00:21:28,105 --> 00:21:29,440
如果失败了
If the drug fails...

377
00:21:29,565 --> 00:21:31,692
我们不是从大街上随便抓一个人来
We're not just grabbing anybody off the street.

378
00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:34,319
这个人得了绝症，晚期了
The test subject is a terminally ill

379
00:21:34,361 --> 00:21:36,405
他自愿的
patient who has volunteered himself.

380
00:21:38,115 --> 00:21:40,325
这不是一个决定
These are not exactly the type of decisions

381
00:21:40,325 --> 00:21:43,287
我想试试
I was expecting to make on this expedition.

382
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,508
做吧
Do it.

383
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:10,898
嗨, Steve
Hi, Steve.

384
00:22:11,815 --> 00:22:13,734
还要样本?
More samples?

385
00:22:13,817 --> 00:22:16,612
我想沿着一片田地
I was thinking more along the lines of a field trip.

386
00:22:16,904 --> 00:22:17,988
你想要食物么?
You want sustenance?

387
00:22:18,739 --> 00:22:20,574
我要信息
I want information.

388
00:22:23,077 --> 00:22:26,663
你无法提供这样的交易
You are incapable of offering such a trade.

389
00:22:27,414 --> 00:22:32,044
如果你告诉我一些有价值的东西，我给你吃的
You tell me something of value, I let you eat.

390
00:22:32,252 --> 00:22:33,212
这就是你的晚餐
That's the deal.

391
00:22:33,337 --> 00:22:35,756
要或不要
Take it or leave it.

392
00:22:39,843 --> 00:22:41,386
很好
Very well.

393
00:22:51,146 --> 00:22:52,606
他们准备好了么?
Are they ready?

394
00:22:53,023 --> 00:22:56,693
Sheppard少校和Ford少尉
正将犯人送去探险者2号
Major Sheppard and Lieutenant Ford
are loading the prisoner into Jumper Two.

395
00:22:56,693 --> 00:22:58,695
bates军士也准备好了
Sergeant bates is already on the ground

396
00:22:58,737 --> 00:23:02,783
在集合地点等待他们的降落
and standing by for their arrival
at the rendezvous site.

397
00:23:20,884 --> 00:23:22,052
探险者2号, 我是Weir
Jumper Two, this is Weir.

398
00:23:22,136 --> 00:23:23,178
你现在怎样?
What's your status?

399
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:23,971
很好
Nice and cosy in here.

400
00:23:24,012 --> 00:23:25,848
准备出发
We're ready to depart.

401
00:23:25,889 --> 00:23:27,099
注意安全 少校
Be safe, Major.

402
00:23:27,474 --> 00:23:28,809
这就是计划
That's the plan.

403
00:23:29,101 --> 00:23:31,019
探险者2号，准备发射
Jumper Two, you are go for launch.

404
00:23:31,061 --> 00:23:32,229
Roger
Roger that.

405
00:23:33,564 --> 00:23:34,982
拉起来
Dial it up.

406
00:23:41,196 --> 00:23:43,490
嗨，伙计，这并不有趣
Hey, man, this isn't supposed to be fun.

407
00:24:04,094 --> 00:24:06,638
Perna 跟我说了你的病情
Perna explained to me about your illness.

408
00:24:07,431 --> 00:24:09,767
我希望你知道我很抱歉
I want you to know how sorry I am.

409
00:24:10,642 --> 00:24:12,895
我希望可以帮你做点什么
I wish there was something I could do for you.

410
00:24:13,562 --> 00:24:14,855
时间到了, Beckett博士
It's my time, Doctor Beckett.

411
00:24:15,814 --> 00:24:17,983
现在看我的运气吧
I'm at peace with my fate.

412
00:24:19,068 --> 00:24:20,986
我希望你知道，这很重要，
I think it's important you know

413
00:24:21,153 --> 00:24:24,740
或许结果没有想得那么好
that we may be talking about a
less than peaceful ending here.

414
00:24:24,865 --> 00:24:28,619
我已经跟 Merell 详细的解释过会发生什么事情
I have explained to Merell in
great detail what may befall him.

415
00:24:30,454 --> 00:24:33,540
你必须明白这种药物重来没有使用过
You should also understand
that this drug has never worked

416
00:24:33,624 --> 00:24:36,251
除了在实验室不断的模拟试验
in anything other than a laboratory simulation.

417
00:24:36,835 --> 00:24:39,004
我们无法确定会发生什么事情
We don't know for certain what will happen.

418
00:24:40,089 --> 00:24:41,548
就算没有用,
Even if it doesn't work,

419
00:24:42,508 --> 00:24:43,759
你也可以知道一些有价值的信息
you'll learn something of value

420
00:24:45,928 --> 00:24:47,971
将来如何完善它?
how to perfect it in the future?

421
00:24:48,847 --> 00:24:53,477
或许，但你没有理由去面对那些生物
Possibly, but that's no reason
for you to face that creature.

422
00:24:55,104 --> 00:24:57,439
Beckett博士, 我不害怕
Doctor Beckett, I'm not afraid.

423
00:24:58,607 --> 00:25:01,485
不管发生什么事情，我的死都会很有意义
No matter what happens, my death will have meaning.

424
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:05,114
这不就是我们努力争取的么,
Is that not something we all strive for,

425
00:25:05,239 --> 00:25:07,241
死得有意义?
to die knowing we made a difference?

426
00:25:09,034 --> 00:25:10,702
我想这么做
I want to do this.

427
00:25:11,745 --> 00:25:14,665
请不要让我失去这个为人民服务的机会
Please don't deny me the chance to help my people.

428
00:25:24,466 --> 00:25:25,717
你怎么看?
What do you think?

429
00:25:25,968 --> 00:25:27,886
我实在无法相信
That it goes against everything I believe in.

430
00:25:28,053 --> 00:25:31,223
在我的家乡，学医的人之中流传一种诅咒
There's an oath among medical people where I come from.

431
00:25:31,348 --> 00:25:33,308
刚开始，并没有什么害处
It begins, First, do no harm.

432
00:25:33,976 --> 00:25:37,271
- 对你很重要的话
- 不止这些Perna
- Important words to you.
- More than words, Perna.

433
00:25:38,439 --> 00:25:41,650
试验就要开始了
The battle rages at the very
threshold of our laboratory now.

434
00:25:42,151 --> 00:25:44,153
我们努力工作到最好，知道
Those of us working to the last know

435
00:25:44,194 --> 00:25:46,697
这最后的一点时间是很宝贵的,
that these few final hours have been dearly purchased,

436
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:49,575
我们的注意力还没有消减
yet our concentration has not waned.

437
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,119
我们无法期望自救
We cannot hope to save ourselves

438
00:25:52,161 --> 00:25:54,997
但是我们可以希望最后一点有力的发现,
but we can hope that one last insight,

439
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,208
在我们还剩最后一口气之前,
one last revelation before we take our dying breaths,

440
00:25:58,333 --> 00:26:02,337
可能可以阻止这样恐怖的事情再次发生
may prevent this terrible day from happening again.

441
00:26:02,629 --> 00:26:04,798
Ferrel的最后一次日记
Ferrel's last journal entry.

442
00:26:05,424 --> 00:26:07,509
什么都别说, Carson
More than words, Carson.

443
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,594
我明白
I understand that.

444
00:26:08,969 --> 00:26:09,511
我了解
I do.

445
00:26:09,678 --> 00:26:11,138
但是还有很多人不知道
But there are too many unknowns.

446
00:26:11,221 --> 00:26:12,681
我们需要时间来确定它的副作用
We need time to determine the possible side-effects...

447
00:26:12,765 --> 00:26:13,849
没有时间了!
There is no time!

448
00:26:14,641 --> 00:26:16,685
你这么害怕犯错么
Are you so afraid of making a mistake

449
00:26:16,769 --> 00:26:19,354
那你永远也无法知道我们要面临的是什么?
that you can no longer see what we're up against?

450
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,107
不是害怕犯错 Perna,
This isn't about making mistakes Perna,

451
00:26:22,149 --> 00:26:24,610
这是方法问题,
it's about the end justifying the means,

452
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:27,696
对于我们的专业而言，这是个灾难
and in our profession that's a very slippery slope.

453
00:26:29,448 --> 00:26:31,533
我们并不确定这一定有效
We have no idea if this'll work.

454
00:26:32,034 --> 00:26:34,953
我们可能是将这个人送给了一个怪物
We could be sacrificing that man to a monster.

455
00:26:35,579 --> 00:26:37,873
还会有其他人接替他的位置
There will be another to take his place.

456
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,627
这就是我害怕的
That's just what I'm afraid of.

457
00:26:48,592 --> 00:26:49,843
他们好了
They are ready.

458
00:26:54,473 --> 00:26:55,933
当心
Careful, sir.

459
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:10,697
这就是你承诺的食物?
This is the sustenance you promised?

460
00:27:10,739 --> 00:27:13,325
计划有点变动
Little change in plans.

461
00:27:13,992 --> 00:27:18,747
你现在就告诉我，否则就什么都没有了
You tell me something right now,
or the damned party's cancelled.

462
00:27:18,956 --> 00:27:20,416
你想知道什么?
What do you want to know?

463
00:27:20,749 --> 00:27:22,793
还有多少舰队
How many hive ships have become operational

464
00:27:22,835 --> 00:27:24,878
自从我们唤醒了第一个?
since we awakened the first one?

465
00:27:25,045 --> 00:27:27,172
所有, Sheppard少校
All of them, Major Sheppard.

466
00:27:27,464 --> 00:27:32,469
首先，他们会去饲养基地，增强力量
First, they will travel to their own
feeding grounds and gather strength.

467
00:27:33,095 --> 00:27:35,347
我们是很有忍耐力的民族, 少校
We are a patient race, Major.

468
00:27:36,181 --> 00:27:39,685
当我们的力量完全聚集之后,
When we have taken our fill and gathered our strength,

469
00:27:40,018 --> 00:27:43,689
就会向你们发起攻击
we will join force and come for you.

470
00:27:43,772 --> 00:27:45,566
什么时候?
D'you have any idea when that'll be?

471
00:27:45,816 --> 00:27:46,400
早上?
Morning?

472
00:27:46,442 --> 00:27:48,026
下午?
Afternoon?

473
00:27:51,655 --> 00:27:52,781
打开
Open it up.

474
00:28:05,169 --> 00:28:06,920
你不需要这么做
You don't have to do this.

475
00:28:08,338 --> 00:28:08,839
我知道
I know.

476
00:28:11,717 --> 00:28:13,010
我准备好了
I'm ready.

477
00:28:40,704 --> 00:28:42,456
他很虚弱
He is weak.

478
00:29:29,906 --> 00:29:32,408
你们都是Hoffan人民的英雄
You are both heroes of the Hoffan people.

479
00:29:32,909 --> 00:29:34,744
我承认，这很疯狂
I'll admit, it was amazing.

480
00:29:35,328 --> 00:29:36,954
我希望你的朋友也能加入我们
I hope your friends will join us for

481
00:29:36,996 --> 00:29:38,831
的一个为你办的庆功宴
a celebratory banquet to honour your work.

482
00:29:39,207 --> 00:29:40,374
我们很愿意参加，但是你
We'll be glad to attend, but don't you

483
00:29:40,416 --> 00:29:42,585
觉不觉得庆功宴有点太早了?
think celebrations are a bit premature?

484
00:29:42,794 --> 00:29:44,879
这个结果
The results speak for themselves.

485
00:29:45,129 --> 00:29:47,048
我打算让议会通过
I intend to ask the Council to approve

486
00:29:47,089 --> 00:29:49,342
大批量生产这种血清,立即生效
mass production of the serum, effective immediately.

487
00:29:49,425 --> 00:29:52,470
今天之后,
我想不会有任何异议
After what happened today,
I doubt they will offer any resistance.

488
00:29:52,553 --> 00:29:54,347
这真是个好消息，长官
That is wonderful news, Chancellor.

489
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:56,057
值得尊重，不
With all due respect, no it isn't.

490
00:29:56,474 --> 00:29:58,434
我们现在在说的是一个测试
We're talking about one test here.

491
00:29:58,935 --> 00:30:01,354
对于这个结果我和大家一样高兴
Now I'm as pleased as anyone with the results

492
00:30:01,562 --> 00:30:02,939
但是我们还要很多事情要做
but we still have a lot of work to do

493
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,607
在我们开始将它投入生产之前
before we can start using it.

494
00:30:04,816 --> 00:30:08,277
Beckett 博士希望可以进行一系列测试
Doctor Beckett wishes to run a full series of tests

495
00:30:08,402 --> 00:30:11,280
对这个结果进行反覆论证
on Merell prior to issuing his final report.

496
00:30:11,405 --> 00:30:12,615
可能会有些副作用
There may have been mitigating circumstances

497
00:30:12,657 --> 00:30:14,575
比如说，这个人可能会死
the man was dying, for one.

498
00:30:16,369 --> 00:30:16,911
当然
Of course.

499
00:30:17,328 --> 00:30:18,663
我会跟议会说明的
I'll bring it up with Council.

500
00:30:19,664 --> 00:30:21,374
为了成功
To success.

501
00:30:25,211 --> 00:30:26,003
怎么了?
What is it?

502
00:30:26,129 --> 00:30:28,089
Steve看起来好像很难受
It's Steve he doesn't look so good.

503
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:32,677
他这个样子多久了?
How long has he been like this?

504
00:30:33,136 --> 00:30:34,220
测试之后
Since the test.

505
00:30:34,262 --> 00:30:35,513
是不是什么诡计?
Think it's a ruse?

506
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,223
他们不会来这套
It is not their way.

507
00:30:43,271 --> 00:30:43,896
嗨
Hey.

508
00:30:46,107 --> 00:30:47,692
你对我做了什么?
What have you done to me?

509
00:31:04,959 --> 00:31:06,377
叫Beckett过来
We need Beckett in here.

510
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:07,462
快去
Go.

511
00:31:14,594 --> 00:31:16,053
我们会帮你的
We're gonna help you.

512
00:31:18,931 --> 00:31:20,850
不需要你的可怜
Don't feel pity for me.

513
00:31:22,477 --> 00:31:26,022
其他幽灵来的时候，你们会比我现在更惨
You will suffer far worse when the others come for you.

514
00:31:49,587 --> 00:31:50,213
少校
Major.

515
00:31:51,047 --> 00:31:52,924
我正准备把他解剖
I was just about to cut him open.

516
00:31:53,382 --> 00:31:55,468
那我先走
Then, I was just leaving.

517
00:31:55,802 --> 00:31:59,305
我已经做了一系列的测试，你可能对结果会有兴趣
I've already done a series of tests
you might like to know the results of.

518
00:31:59,806 --> 00:32:01,099
你知道是什么使他死去的么?
You know what killed him?

519
00:32:01,224 --> 00:32:02,892
我检查了他身体的一部分，发现，
I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say

520
00:32:03,017 --> 00:32:06,562
他体内的重要器官几乎同时停止工作
that it was all of his vital organs
shutting down almost simultaneously.

521
00:32:06,813 --> 00:32:08,147
他是饿死的么?
Did he starve to death?

522
00:32:08,272 --> 00:32:08,898
不
No.

523
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,817
取决于他的体制,
Based on the condition his body's in,

524
00:32:10,942 --> 00:32:12,902
我觉得他不是饿死的
I don't think he died from a lack of nourishment.

525
00:32:12,944 --> 00:32:14,112
那么是什么?
Well, then, what was it?

526
00:32:14,153 --> 00:32:16,114
初步测试显示
Initial tests revealed a significant amount

527
00:32:16,155 --> 00:32:17,949
在他体内有相当数量的HOFFEN的血清
of Hoffan serum in his bloodstream.

528
00:32:18,157 --> 00:32:20,618
我想在他身体的
I'm guessing we'll find similar trace amounts

529
00:32:20,743 --> 00:32:23,079
的其他部分也一样，如果我们一一测试的话
in each of his organs once we analyse those as well.

530
00:32:23,162 --> 00:32:25,873
为什么这种药物会是他的血液凝固?
Why did the Hoffan drug end up in his blood?

531
00:32:26,082 --> 00:32:27,667
根据Hoffans的研究,
From the Hoffans' research,

532
00:32:27,708 --> 00:32:29,460
我们知道当幽灵吃东西时,
we know that when the Wraith feed,

533
00:32:29,544 --> 00:32:32,088
他们会向食物体内注射一种化学物质
they release a chemical into their victims' bodies.

534
00:32:32,255 --> 00:32:34,841
但是我们还不清楚这种物质到底起什么作用,
What it actually does, we don't yet understand,

535
00:32:35,174 --> 00:32:37,802
我猜测，在某种程度上，
but I can only assume that it prepares the human body

536
00:32:37,885 --> 00:32:40,346
可以使人体慢慢干枯
in some way to be drained of life.

537
00:32:40,388 --> 00:32:42,056
这种血清本来是
The serum is designed

538
00:32:42,098 --> 00:32:45,309
用来抵御这种物质的，当它一进入人体时，使之冻结
to shield the victim from that
initial chemical release, blocking it.

539
00:32:45,601 --> 00:32:46,561
好的
OK.

540
00:32:47,395 --> 00:32:49,772
我猜测这种血清蛋白产生了变异
I think the serum protein may have mutated

541
00:32:49,814 --> 00:32:51,190
当它和幽灵释放的化学物质相遇时,
when it was exposed to the Wraith chemical,

542
00:32:51,232 --> 00:32:53,526
触发了某些中毒的反应
triggering some sort of toxic reaction.

543
00:32:53,526 --> 00:32:55,027
所以不但没有吃掉他
So instead of feeding off of him...

544
00:32:55,111 --> 00:32:56,988
自己反而死了
... he was poisoned.

545
00:32:58,114 --> 00:32:59,991
如果血清真是这样,
So if the serum did this,

546
00:33:00,032 --> 00:33:02,910
那么这不仅仅是种地狱幽灵的药物
then it's more than just a defence against the Wraith.

547
00:33:03,828 --> 00:33:05,413
甚至可以杀死他们
It kills 'em.

548
00:33:06,873 --> 00:33:08,958
我不知道为什么拉警报, 少校
I fail to see cause for alarm, Major.

549
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,670
这个发现大大增强了血清的价值
If anything, this development dramatically
increases the value of the serum.

550
00:33:12,795 --> 00:33:14,547
现在没有任何疑问 了
No it just takes away any doubt

551
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:17,216
当幽灵们最终到这里的时候要干什么
about what the Wraith'll do
when they eventually come here.

552
00:33:17,925 --> 00:33:19,510
我不觉得有什么不同
I fail to see the difference.

553
00:33:19,677 --> 00:33:21,846
一旦他们知道我们拥有这样一种武器,
Once they learn you possess a weapon such as this,

554
00:33:21,929 --> 00:33:26,476
幽灵们会为了死去的幽灵报仇而将我们灭族
the Wraith will wipe your people from
existence in retaliation for the Wraith deaths.

555
00:33:26,601 --> 00:33:30,146
或者他们会把我们留下，当他们发现我们
Or they may simply leave us
alone once they learn we are...

556
00:33:30,646 --> 00:33:31,814
一点都不好吃
unpalatable.

557
00:33:31,898 --> 00:33:35,359
因为他们是种随和的，愿意和别人和平共处的族类
Cos they're such an easy-going
live-and-let-live kind of race.

558
00:33:35,651 --> 00:33:36,944
你知道的，或许有一半的机会
Y'know, maybe there was half a chance

559
00:33:36,986 --> 00:33:38,070
当你谈论
of that when you were talking

560
00:33:38,112 --> 00:33:39,697
这个的时候,但是现在
about this being defensive, but now...

561
00:33:39,739 --> 00:33:41,908
你无法看到更多了, 少校
You fail to see the larger picture, Major.

562
00:33:41,949 --> 00:33:43,493
一开始，我们本可以不尽是防卫
For the first time we have a way to not

563
00:33:43,534 --> 00:33:45,995
还要反攻
just defend ourselves but to strike back.

564
00:33:46,037 --> 00:33:48,581
这到底是报复呢，还是保卫你的人民?
Is this about revenge, or saving your people?

565
00:33:50,833 --> 00:33:53,920
你无法理解这样的痛苦
You can't hope to understand
the generations of suffering...

566
00:33:54,003 --> 00:33:56,964
我在他们那里待过，跟他们战斗过,
I've been in one of their hives and
I've fought against their ships and,

567
00:33:57,048 --> 00:34:00,468
相信我，一旦有一个幽灵因为这种药物而死了,
trust me, when the first Wraith
dies because of this drug,

568
00:34:00,551 --> 00:34:02,136
他们不会轻易就离开的
they're not gonna simply move on.

569
00:34:02,261 --> 00:34:04,347
他们会把这个问题解决
They're gonna make their problem go away.

570
00:34:04,472 --> 00:34:06,099
一旦你的世界被毁了,
Once your world has been destroyed,

571
00:34:06,224 --> 00:34:08,684
他们会找出任何一个和你有关联的人
they will seek out any who have had contact with you.

572
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,269
他们不会放过任何一个
They will spare no-one.

573
00:34:10,394 --> 00:34:12,105
听着，我知道你对这个抱着很大的热情
Listen, I know how passionate you are about this

574
00:34:12,146 --> 00:34:14,398
这药或许从某种意义上来说像圣杯一样, 但是
this drug is sort of your Holy Grail, but...

575
00:34:14,857 --> 00:34:18,069
在我们想出更好的办法之前，这个最后暂时停停
You're gonna have to shelve it
till we get a better idea...

576
00:34:18,194 --> 00:34:19,112
不，不
No, no.

577
00:34:19,237 --> 00:34:23,699
我是认真的，否则我们无法再帮助你们了
I'm serious otherwise we can't help you any more.

578
00:34:23,866 --> 00:34:26,619
你不明白, 少校, 太晚了e
You don't understand, Major, it's too late.

579
00:34:27,411 --> 00:34:30,623
我已经向以后提案并通过了
I have made my recommendation
to the Council and they've agreed.

580
00:34:31,499 --> 00:34:34,627
我们已经在给我们的人民接种
We have already begun inoculating our people.

581
00:34:53,354 --> 00:34:54,689
你要走么?
You are leaving?

582
00:34:56,232 --> 00:34:57,859
除非你愿意回复正常的工作
Unless you're willing to go back to formal work

583
00:34:57,942 --> 00:34:59,610
对于血清，我没有任何的立足点，不是么?
on the serum there's no point my staying, is there?

584
00:34:59,652 --> 00:35:02,029
- Carson
- Perna, 你必须再次开始这个项目
- Carson
- Perna, you need to re-open the project.

585
00:35:02,196 --> 00:35:02,822
要做更多的工作,
With more work,

586
00:35:02,864 --> 00:35:04,532
或许你可以阻止这样的突变
maybe you could prevent the mutation

587
00:35:04,615 --> 00:35:06,492
使它仅仅成为一种抵抗性药物
maintain it as a defensive drug only.

588
00:35:06,617 --> 00:35:07,368
Merell 死了
Merell is dead.

589
00:35:09,287 --> 00:35:10,538
他们今天早上发现的
They found him this morning.

590
00:35:10,621 --> 00:35:12,582
死因至今不明
The cause of death is still to be determined.

591
00:35:12,623 --> 00:35:14,625
现在还有时间让他们停止接种这种药物
There's still time they need to stop the inoculations.

592
00:35:14,667 --> 00:35:16,335
- 他们不会的
- 有人已经死了
- They won't.
- A man is dead.

593
00:35:16,377 --> 00:35:18,880
但这并不意味着其他人也会一样
Which doesn't necessarily mean more will follow.

594
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:25,803
如果没有更多的证据，就算我想，也无法阻止他们
Even if I wanted to, I couldn't make
them stop, not without more proof.

595
00:35:27,597 --> 00:35:31,851
Perna ，你是我见过的最聪明的人
Perna you're one of the brightest people I've ever met.

596
00:35:32,268 --> 00:35:35,480
为了你自己，我求你,
For your own sake, I beg you,

597
00:35:36,272 --> 00:35:37,940
不要在参与进来了,
have no more part in this,

598
00:35:38,775 --> 00:35:40,777
除非我们有了更多的新发现
at least  until we know more.

599
00:35:43,404 --> 00:35:44,947
我不能这么做
I can't do that.

600
00:35:44,989 --> 00:35:46,032
为什么?
Why not?

601
00:35:46,073 --> 00:35:48,910
因为我也是第一批接种的人之一
Because I was among the first to be inoculated.

602
00:35:55,517 --> 00:35:57,560
我佩服你的危机意识,博士,
I appreciate your sense of urgency, Doctor,

603
00:35:57,685 --> 00:36:00,980
但是现在就匆匆下结论是很不明智的
but at this point it would be
unwise to rush to any conclusions.

604
00:36:01,064 --> 00:36:02,816
现在你要练习谨慎么?
Now you wanna exercise caution?

605
00:36:02,857 --> 00:36:03,858
你是认真的?!
Are you serious?!

606
00:36:04,192 --> 00:36:08,196
少校,你自己也说幽灵们可能就要来了
Major, you yourself have told us the Wraith
could be on their way here right now.

607
00:36:08,279 --> 00:36:10,156
除了前进我们别无选择
We have no choice but to move forward.

608
00:36:10,198 --> 00:36:12,951
长官，你是代表大多数人说话的
You're speaking on behalf
of a lot of people, Chancellor.

609
00:36:13,034 --> 00:36:15,704
你觉得我会强迫我的人民接受这个?
You think I would force this choice upon my own people?

610
00:36:16,287 --> 00:36:18,998
不，先生，我的人民们完全同意
No, sir, our people are in complete agreement.

611
00:36:19,165 --> 00:36:23,378
在幽灵们还没来之前，他们可能就会死
Your people may be dead before the Wraith
even get here for all you know.

612
00:36:23,586 --> 00:36:26,089
长官，求您，现在还不晚
Chancellor, please, it's not too late.

613
00:36:26,172 --> 00:36:29,092
至少推迟接种，在我们知道Merell的死因之前
Suspend the inoculations at least
until we know what killed Merell.

614
00:36:29,217 --> 00:36:29,926
他本来就是末期了
He was terminal.

615
00:36:29,968 --> 00:36:32,762
我们还不确定这种血清是促成他死亡的因素之一
We don't know for certain
the serum played any part in his death.

616
00:36:32,846 --> 00:36:35,640
他突然停止呼吸
He suffered a sudden and
complete respiratory breakdown.

617
00:36:35,849 --> 00:36:37,767
可能是他本身的病所致
Which could well have been due to his condition.

618
00:36:37,851 --> 00:36:40,019
他的病已经扩散到全身了
His sickness had spread through most of his body.

619
00:36:40,186 --> 00:36:42,272
难道你想用成千上万人民的生命来冒险
Are you willing to risk thousands of people's lives

620
00:36:42,313 --> 00:36:44,816
在这个假设的基础上,因为我不是!
based on that assumption, because I'm not!

621
00:36:46,276 --> 00:36:47,110
Sheppard少校?
Major Sheppard?

622
00:36:47,235 --> 00:36:48,611
说, Teyla
Go ahead, Teyla.

623
00:36:48,862 --> 00:36:49,988
我们在医疗中心
We're in the medical centre.

624
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:51,114
现在需要帮助
We need help.

625
00:37:04,878 --> 00:37:06,004
上帝!
My God!

626
00:37:09,549 --> 00:37:10,175
Sheppard少校
Major Sheppard.

627
00:37:11,217 --> 00:37:13,094
医生说从作文开始就有这样的病人陆续到来,
The doctors say they began arriving last night,

628
00:37:13,219 --> 00:37:14,804
他们的数量每小时都在不断增长
and their numbers have been increasing by the hour.

629
00:37:14,888 --> 00:37:15,388
少校
Major.

630
00:37:15,513 --> 00:37:16,598
我在听，继续
I'm on it go.

631
00:37:16,806 --> 00:37:18,516
少尉, 呼叫Weir, 告诉他我们要...
Lieutenant, radio Weir, tell 'em we need

632
00:37:18,558 --> 00:37:21,519
一只设备齐全的医疗队
a full medical support team
on a Jumper and inbound ASAP.

633
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,205
我需要帮助!
I need help here!

634
00:37:40,246 --> 00:37:41,164
氧气!
Oxygen!

635
00:37:42,457 --> 00:37:43,708
放轻松
Take it easy.

636
00:37:59,182 --> 00:38:00,266
别管我们
Leave us.

637
00:38:02,769 --> 00:38:04,854
你对那里发生的事情有什么看法?
D'you have any idea what's going on out there?

638
00:38:04,896 --> 00:38:06,022
我知道, 少校
I do, Major.

639
00:38:06,064 --> 00:38:08,358
有一半的接种了那种药物的人死了
Half the people you gave that drug to are dying.

640
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,151
一半, 少校, 一半
Half of them, Major, half.

641
00:38:11,277 --> 00:38:12,612
这个几率很明显
The statistics are clear

642
00:38:12,737 --> 00:38:15,240
已经确定了，就是这个概率,
and the numbers are holding at
that level, it's just been confirmed,

643
00:38:15,365 --> 00:38:18,910
这就意味着剩下的一半人将活着,
which means the other fifty percen
of those we inoculated will live,

644
00:38:19,077 --> 00:38:21,621
会杀了任何想把他们当食物的幽灵
and destroy any Wraith who try to feed on them.

645
00:38:22,247 --> 00:38:23,707
简直无法相信!
I don't believe this!

646
00:38:23,748 --> 00:38:27,085
现在幽灵们会知道Hoffan人民的全罪
Now the Wraith will know the full
conviction of the Hoffan people.

647
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:28,420
罪行?!
Conviction?!

648
00:38:28,628 --> 00:38:30,338
你到底明不明白，如果
Do you realise that if we could spread

649
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,590
如果我们向银河的每一个人发放这种药物,
this drug to every human in the galaxy,

650
00:38:32,674 --> 00:38:34,217
以后的人永远都不会知道
future generations would never

651
00:38:34,259 --> 00:38:35,760
知道这种优胜劣汰的恐怖
know the horror of a culling.

652
00:38:36,803 --> 00:38:40,223
你故意牺牲上百万的生命
You're deliberately sacrificing millions of lives.

653
00:38:40,348 --> 00:38:41,808
这是幽灵们的终结!
An end to the Wraith!

654
00:38:43,768 --> 00:38:46,104
你为什么非要这么理解?
You can't comprehend the bargain in that?

655
00:38:46,187 --> 00:38:49,315
我们不能这么做!
You can't make a bargain lik
that for your entire people!

656
00:38:49,399 --> 00:38:51,234
你觉得是我一意孤行么?
Do you think I'm alone in this conviction?

657
00:38:51,276 --> 00:38:52,986
我想这是你的错觉!
I think you're delusional!

658
00:38:53,111 --> 00:38:53,737
你会看到的
You shall see.

659
00:38:54,154 --> 00:38:56,698
我们是投票表决的
We are putting it to a vote as we speak.

660
00:38:56,990 --> 00:39:00,368
我代表大多数人的意见
I will stand by the decision of the majority.

661
00:39:01,202 --> 00:39:03,079
这样你满意了么?
Does that satisfy you?

662
00:39:03,121 --> 00:39:05,790
他们明白自己在表决什么么?
Do they have any idea what they're voting on?

663
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,376
是的
Yes.

664
00:39:08,543 --> 00:39:10,086
我保证
I promise you.

665
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:12,672
如果大部分人都不赞同，那么你会停止?
And you'll back off if it doesn't go your way?

666
00:39:12,756 --> 00:39:14,382
是的
You have my word.

667
00:39:22,265 --> 00:39:24,100
这些房间你随便用吧
Use whatever rooms you need for overflow.

668
00:39:24,225 --> 00:39:26,519
我们要保持这片地方的干净
We need to keep this area clear for triage.

669
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:33,735
Teyla, 你在这
Teyla, there you are.

670
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:36,821
请确认氧气瓶在医院的各处都分配好了
Make sure that our oxygen is properly
deployed throughout the hospital.

671
00:39:36,905 --> 00:39:37,489
博士
Doctor.

672
00:39:37,614 --> 00:39:39,616
让那些不是很严重的病人先轮流用
Have non-critical patients use it in turns

673
00:39:39,657 --> 00:39:41,868
保持呼吸平稳
just long enough to stabilise their breathing.

674
00:39:42,869 --> 00:39:43,953
Teyla, 你在这儿干嘛?
Teyla, what are you doing here?

675
00:39:43,995 --> 00:39:44,913
你没听到我说什么么
You're not listening to me.

676
00:39:44,954 --> 00:39:46,790
Perna呢?
我需要她的帮忙
Now where's Perna?
I need her here.

677
00:39:46,831 --> 00:39:47,832
Carson
Carson.

678
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:12,857
我想再看看Atlantis
I would... like to have seen Atlantis.

679
00:40:15,652 --> 00:40:16,403
Perna
Perna.

680
00:40:16,903 --> 00:40:18,655
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

681
00:40:21,241 --> 00:40:22,409
别这样
Don't be.

682
00:40:24,786 --> 00:40:27,080
对于我所做的我很平静,
I am at peace with what
I have done,

683
00:40:28,248 --> 00:40:30,375
你也应该这样
as you should be.

684
00:40:31,459 --> 00:40:33,670
我希望我从来没参与过这件事情
I wish I'd had no part in this.

685
00:40:34,504 --> 00:40:36,715
你带给我们希望
You gave us hope.

686
00:40:39,008 --> 00:40:42,971
很多年了，我们一直在努力研究
For... years, our people have been working...

687
00:40:43,012 --> 00:40:43,805
向着这个目标
towards this...

688
00:40:45,098 --> 00:40:46,516
每分每秒
very moment.

689
00:40:50,895 --> 00:40:54,566
我们没有背叛我们的祖先
We didn't betray the forefathers.

690
00:40:54,774 --> 00:40:59,863
我们完成了他们的使命
We have fulfilled their destiny, their promise.

691
00:41:00,864 --> 00:41:01,906
是
Aye.

692
00:41:08,872 --> 00:41:09,998
停下
Stay.

693
00:41:10,582 --> 00:41:11,750
停下
Stay.

694
00:41:34,522 --> 00:41:36,191
- 你还好吧?
- 是
- You OK?
- Aye.

695
00:41:41,571 --> 00:41:42,989
听说你要走了
I am told you are leaving.

696
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:44,616
是的
Yes, we are.

697
00:41:44,783 --> 00:41:47,285
不是那个
Not that it hasn't been... lovely.

698
00:41:47,911 --> 00:41:51,081
我希望你离开前看看投票的结果
I wanted you to see the results
of the vote before you left.

699
00:41:58,338 --> 00:42:00,382
96％的人赞成
Ninety-six percent in favour.

700
00:42:01,132 --> 00:42:02,842
是全民投票么?
Does the vote include all your people?

701
00:42:02,926 --> 00:42:04,302
每个人
Every one.

702
00:42:04,302 --> 00:42:08,848
你看到了, 少校,我们都很一致，大家都很坚决
So you see, Major, we speak with one voice,
and we are resolute.

703
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:09,557
是的
Yeah.

704
00:42:09,724 --> 00:42:10,767
我明白了
I can see that.

705
00:42:11,851 --> 00:42:14,062
下次我们见面的时候，我希望可以讨论比较好的办法
When next we meet, I would like to discuss the best way

706
00:42:14,187 --> 00:42:16,773
尽可能的把药分到世界的各个角落
to disseminate the drug on as many worlds as possible.

707
00:42:16,981 --> 00:42:19,275
我们不会很快久这么做的
We won't be doing that any time soon.

708
00:42:19,484 --> 00:42:21,820
或许我们的胜利会让你改变主意
Perhaps our victory will change your mind.

709
00:42:21,861 --> 00:42:26,032
但我们回来的时候，我不认为你还会在
If and when we ever return,
I don't imagine you'll be here.

710
00:42:27,033 --> 00:42:29,953
我也不认为还会有任何人的存在
I don't imagine anybody else will be, either.

711
00:42:40,213 --> 00:42:41,673
好运
Good luck.

712
00:42:47,887 --> 00:42:49,431
"不计任何代价的胜利"
"Victory at all costs".

713
00:42:49,472 --> 00:42:51,433
听起来很耳熟, 少校?
That sound familiar, Major?

714
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:52,976
Churchill
Churchill.

715
00:42:53,101 --> 00:42:53,518
是
Aye.

716
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:56,354
我决不会同意的


Never thought I'd disagree.
