00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,320
最小的孩子出生后就没来过
My littlest was born.

148
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,730
那有七年了
Oh, seven years?

149
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,920
九年了
Nine.

150
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,330
是她要结婚了吗
She the one getting married?

151
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,820
九岁的哪能结婚啊
You don't marry off no nine-year-old.

152
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:28,340
我可见过  在查尔斯顿的皇后街上
I seen it, though, back on Queen Street over in Charleston.

153
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,440
他们在那儿打过一仗
They fought the war over that.

154
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,120
才不是为了那个打仗的呢
That's not why they fought the war.

155
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,790
你这么聪明  说傻话呢
You're too smart to be that dumb.

156
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:43,840
你叫什么
What's your name?

157
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,400
道特
Daughter.

158
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,650
名字叫这个
That's your name?

159
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,120
是的  先生
Yes, sir.

160
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:58,570
我以前养过条蓝斑猎狗  我也没叫他猎狗啊
Had me a bluetick coon once and didn't call him Hound.

161
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,330
-你长什么样  -先生
- What you look like? - Sir?

162
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:06,630
我手放在面前都看不到
I can't see my hand in front of my face.

163
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,850
你得告诉我
You got to tell me.

164
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:11,550
-我  -她是个美人  奥斯卡
- I... - She a beauty, Oscar.

165
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,570
我不怀疑
I don't doubt it.

166
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,510
我一点不怀疑
I do not doubt it.

167
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,630
威姆斯  你在吗
Hey, Weems? You there?

168
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:24,730
-是  先生  -爱丽丝来了吗
- Yes, sir. - Well, Ayleese show up yet?

169
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,140
她放假
Her day off.

170
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:32,730
小猎狗  你会做饭吗
Hey, uh, Bluetick, you cook?

171
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,850
没办法才下厨
If I have to.

172
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,000
那快去吧
Well, you best get to it.

173
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,610
你们都跟她去
The rest of y'all go with her.

174
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:40,990
要我留下吗  叔叔
You want me to stay, Uncle?

175
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:43,080
那我就会说了
Ah, if I want that, I say that.

176
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,040
我告诉你东西都在哪
I'll show you where everything is.

177
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,700
-希望有围裙  -有的  女士
- Hope there's an apron. - Yes, ma'am, we got that.

178
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,670
你来这儿干什么  阿尔伯特
What you come here for, Albert?

179
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,270
照你说的做
What you told me.

180
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,010
我说的多了
Well, I told you a lot.

181
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,830
都不知道你听进去没
Don't know what you heard.

182
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,570
无论如何  不能相信白人
Never trust no buckras, no matter what.

183
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,720
也别相信黑人
Never trust no browns neither.

184
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:23,110
你都说对了
You was right on both counts.

185
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:31,420
你得现实点
You need to be realistic.

186
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,880
五十英里之内  再没这样的房子了
There isn't a house like it within 50 miles.

187
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:35,540
这可不是什么好事
That's not to its advantage.

188
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:40,720
而且你需要一名不问太多问题的买家
And you've needed a buyer who's not inclined to ask too many questions.

189
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,040
我们现在就是这样
That's what we have here.

190
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:45,150
三万七千不少了
$37,000 is a substantial sum.

191
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,990
-对我这种人来说  -对谁都不少
- For someone like me. - For anyone.

192
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,720
准将可不会这么想
The Commodore wouldn't think so.

193
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:52,650
路易会在逆境中尽力而为

194
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,610
我可得拿这笔钱养孩子呢
I'll have to raise a child on it.

195
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,170
余生也都指着这钱了
Support myself for the rest of my life.

196
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,730
-你不是有新情人了吗  -什么
- Isn't there a new companion? - I'm sorry?

197
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:02,620
他怎么打算的
What are his intentions?

198
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,890
这可不关你的事
That's really not your concern.

199
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:07,170
这跟爱情无关  是关于钱
This isn't about love, it's about finances.

200
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:10,410
我知道你这方面一向精明
I've never known you to be foolish about those.

201
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:12,980
-或许我变了  -人很少变
- Well, maybe I've changed. - That rarely occurs.

202
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,410
如果你这么认为  利安德  我可怜你
If that's how you feel, Leander, I pity you.

203
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:16,980
我强烈要求你接受那个条件
I urge you to take the offer.

204
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:20,170
费里先生  我要是输了怎么办
Mr. Ferry, what if I lose?

205
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,360
总体来说  我们的案子还是非常
Overall, our case is still very--

206
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,990
但是输了之后会发生什么
But what happens?

207
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,610
上诉  当然了
Appeal, of course.

208
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,780
涉及到撒格斯基的条件是否合适

209

还有环境正向改变的新问题

210
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,470
比如说  出售房屋
The sale of the house, just for example.

211
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,950
有足够资源的话  我们可以僵持好几年
With enough resources, we can tie it up for years.

212
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:37,540
-这段期间汤米在哪  -由你抚养
- And where is Tommy during all that? - With you.

213
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,920
由他们抚养  由慈善机构抚养  
With them, a benevolent institution.

214
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,340
都有可能
Those are all possibilities.

215
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,160
特伦顿孤儿抚养院吗
The Trenton Home for Friendless Children?

216
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,960
说不准具体是哪一家机构
I couldn't say what particular institution--

217
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,370
你知道那里什么样吗
Do you know what it's like there?

218
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:50,510
-这没有意义  -因为我知道
- There's no point-- - Because I do.

219
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:53,180
我知道
I do.

220
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,420
我们这次谈话讨论的是未来
This conversation is about the future.

221
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,740
童年稍纵即逝
Childhood doesn't last.

222
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,760
一切都稍纵即逝
Nothing lasts.

223
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,160
他都不会记得
He won't even remember.

224
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,210
好几年吗
Years?

225
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,060
有如下条件你才会赢

时间  资金还有坚持不懈

一旦抓住就不放手

知道对方的能力限度

229
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,560
不断地投入资金
...to incur ongoing costs,

230
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:19,250
我们计划的时间越长
the longer we can draw it out...

00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:34,060
没什么好讲的  我没见过他

236
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:35,470
你哥哥呢

00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:39,490
把一切都安排好了
Put the whole thing in place,

238
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:40,760
没给他选择的机会

239
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,390
这个黑人  这个博士
This dinge they got, the doctor...

240
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,420
他们通过他做生意

241
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,350
努基听一个黑人的指挥

242
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,240
你是这个意思吗

243
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,540
金钱
The money, he--

244
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,570
他受不了金钱的诱惑
He can't walk away from that.

245
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,540
-芝加哥那边呢  -没参与这件事

只是在还债
Just paying off a debt.

248
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,610

你猜不透努基的心思
You don't know how Nucky thinks.

00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:31,440
-你说他喜欢钱  -不足以让他收手
- You said he likes the money. - That won't stop him.

258
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:33,800
他总提到和平
He talks about peace.

259
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:37,960
他不是真心的  从来都不是
He doesn't mean it. He never has.

260
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,370
你欣赏那一点
You admire that?

261
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,450
你跟我们一起长大的吗

用报纸当毯子

那种滋味永远忘不了
You don't forget.

267

00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,070
-他是我哥  -他不是你儿子的父亲
- He's my brother. - He's not the father of your son.

269
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,790
没让他进监狱  不是吗
Kept him out of jail, didn't he?

270
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,050
这个我说不准

271
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,460
克莱顿·戴维斯的判决马上到了

274
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,090
把这次会议开成  要不然
Make the meeting happen, or don't--

275
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:23,360
你自己承担后果
the consequences are for you to live with.

276
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,460
但是要记住
But just bear this in mind--

277
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,490
不管你有什么借口
whatever your excuse,

278
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,090
你跟我是一条船上的人

281
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,370
-跟你有什么关系  -别喝了
- What's it to you? - Lay off it.

282
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,340
我不喜欢酒鬼
You're no good to me like that.

283
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,960
烤面包
Crunchy toast?

284
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,000
是木莓果酱面包
It's raspberry jam.

285
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,310
听起来很不错
That does sound good.

286
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,720
你认识我  对吧
You know me, don't you?

287
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,370
你是奶奶
You're Mima.

288
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,000
但我是谁
But who am I?

289
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,260
我是你妈妈吗
Am I your mother?

290
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:54,830
不是
No.

291
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:56,410
她在哪
Where is she?

292
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,350
她死了
She's gone.

293
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,450
你爸爸呢
And your father?

294
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,000
他在哪
Where is he?

295
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,210
我不知道
I don't know.

296
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:07,690
我也不知道
I don't either.

297
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,890
太糟了是吧
Isn't it terrible?

298
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:18,520
你过来好吗  求你了
Would you come to me? Please?

299
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,980
别碰他
Don't touch him.

300
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,850
-你住在这里  -你不是
- You live here. - You don't.

301
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,840
你不会把我怎么样的
You wouldn't.

302
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,340
至少不会当着他的面
Not in front of him.

303
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,450
你离开就好
You just need to leave.

304
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,390
这是你和他的计划吗
Is this how you planned it with her?

305
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,810
抢走我珍爱的一切
To take everything away that matters?

306
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,640
我没计划任何事
I didn't plan anything.

307
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,070
但还是发生了
But it happened anyway.

308
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,450
是吉米的
They're Jimmy's.

309
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,610
他不应该有点
Shouldn't he have something

310
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:28,670
怀念他爸爸的东西吗
to remember?

311
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,660
不应该这样吗
Wouldn't that be right?

312
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,720
留好了
Keep these safe.

313
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,200
你手指上有个戒指
There's a ring on your finger.

314
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:02,520
是的
Yes.

315
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,800
你们俩
And you'll both...

316
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,990
好好照顾他
take good care of him.

317
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:49,340
到了
Okay, then.

318
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:53,070
那些人也一起吃饭吗
Are those men coming to dinner too?

319
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,990
他们是保护努基叔叔的
They keep an eye on things for Uncle Nucky.

320
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,590
海滩的天气真不错
Lovely day for the beach.

321
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:13,710
信天翁

322
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,240
怎么了
What's wrong?

323
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,310
大老远地来吃饭
Haul all the way out here.

324
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:20,780
他在示好
He's making a gesture.

325
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:23,540
对我们来说更不容易
Bigger effort for us than for him.

326
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,060
受不了你们两个
Honestly, the two of you.

327
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,300
你们好啊  伙计们
Ahoy, mateys.

328
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,720
-请求上船  -批准
- Permission to come aboard? - Permission granted.

329
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,270
厨房还需要帮忙吧
You probably need a hand in the kitchen?

330
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:36,070
不  一切都准备好了
No, everything's been taken care of.

331
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,460
谁想先去游泳
Who's up for a swim first?

332
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,740
-我想  我  -我先游
-I am! Me! - Me first!

333
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:48,880
屋顶修好了吗
You tend to that roof yet?

334
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:50,740
我会去修的
I'll get around to it.

335
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:53,480
-它自己可不能修好  -这是常识
- It don't fix itself. - Natural fact.

336
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,250
房子会归你的  温斯顿  你记住了
House goes to you, Winston. You mind that.

337
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,690
我跟你说  要修的地方可不少
A lot to look after, I tell you what.

338
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,210
房子是我姐姐尤拉莉亚的
House belonged to my sister Eulalia.

339
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:05,840
-为什么  -我名下什么都没有
- How that? - Don't keep nothing in my name,

340
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,120
什么都没有
not a damn thing.

341
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:09,880
她是我妈
She my mother.

342
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,170
-她什么时候去世的  -十二年了
- When did she pass? - 12 year now.

343
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:15,420
温斯顿需要有人来抚养
And Winston needed raising.

344
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:17,870
我可以给你找个地方  奥斯卡  你知道的
I'd have made a place for you, Oscar, you know that.

345
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,610
我不知道
I don't know that.

346
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,750
把你在镇上安顿好了
Set you up proper in town.

347
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,370
我不是无处可去  我来这是因为我想来
I didn't have to. I came here because I meant to.

348
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:29,220
你玩儿完了  就玩儿完了
When you're done, you're done.

349
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,260
是不是
Ain't that right?

350
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,320
这是常识
Natural fact.

351
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,450
跟你说
Tell you what.

352
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,740
安顿我  你看看你惹的麻烦
Set me up, with the mess you make.

353
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,860
没必要的话不要跟
Don't never do no business

354
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:39,010
那些白人做生意
with no ofay smile you don't have to.

355
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,200
他是你朋友  现在又不是了
He's your friend? Not your friend now.

356
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,250
不要跟那些
Yeah, don't ever go near no

357
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,010
纽约的自大狂走得太近
biggity da-da-da from New York.

358
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:49,410
全是口蜜腹剑
A lot of sugar up there.

359
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,270
你知道什么
What you know about it?

360
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,890
-就是一帮恶人  -现在不一样了
- Just a tangle of vipers. - It different now.

361
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,470
才没有不一样  阿尔伯特  都一样
It ain't different, Albert. It ain't different.

362
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,390
你们都有活力了  生活节奏变快了  
You're all lit up and faster,

363
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:57,910
但都一个样
but ain't no different.

364
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:00,600
你忘了你自己是谁
And you forget who you are.

365
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:02,340
你跟一个寄生虫女人
You come runnin' down here with some

366
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:05,990
跑到这里来
easy rider woman by your side.

367
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:09,090
因为你不知道该走哪条路
'Cause you don't know which way to turn.

368
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,410
我说的对吧
Ain't that so?

369
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,640
对吧
Huh?

370
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,670
我是来找你帮忙的  奥斯卡
I come to you for help, Oscar.

371
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,440
瞧瞧你四周
Look around you.

372
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,980
我们在这里怎么帮你
How we gonna help you here?

373
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,220
我们全都要去海边
We all go down the shore.

374
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,440
干什么
And do what?

375
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:32,600
给他们洗澡
Wash them boys away.

376
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,650
有什么意义
Ah. Where your sense at?

377
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:37,780
不用吓我
Don't scare me none.

378
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,100
因为你没做过
'Cause you ain't never done it.

379
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:44,630
该死的 爱丽丝
Damn. Ayleese!

380
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,790
这鸡肉和老婆婆的阴部一样干
This chicken dry as Grandma's snatch.

381
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:49,780
-爱丽丝  -她今天不在  本诺先生
- Ayleese! - She ain't here today, Mr. Boneau.

382
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,070
站在那里的是谁
Well, who's that standin' over there?

383
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,680
你是谁
Who are you?

384
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:56,420
寄生虫
The easy rider.

385
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:01,410
寄...  蓝斑猎狗
Easy-- ah! Bluetick.

386
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,300
阿尔伯特  希望她值得
Sure hope she worth it, Albert.

387
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:08,520
反正她的烂厨艺一毛不值
She sure can't cook worth a damn.

388
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:11,560
我靠
Damn.

389
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,320
-你来了  -我本来想打电话的...
- You're here. - Yes. I was gonna call as soon as I--

390
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,530
我不在家
I wasn't in.

391
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,500
我出去了
I've been out.

392
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:29,220
到处走走
Just walking everywhere.

393
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:32,360
看看那些我多年未去过的地方
Places that I haven't been in years.

394
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,640
都很漂亮
It's all remarkable.

395
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,150
你没事吧
Are you all right?

396
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:40,520
没事
Of course.

397
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,270
-你没有...  -没有没有
- You're not, uh... - No, no.

398
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,640
因为不管有多困难
'Cause that's something you need to fight,

399
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,330
-你都必须全力抗争  -罗伊  不是那个
- no matter how strong-- - Roy, it's not that.

400
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:47,490
是
It's...

401
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,720
我感觉
I feel...

402
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,600
我自由了
I'm free.

403
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:56,630
我终于自由了
I'm finally free.

404
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,100
我知道这里不太方便
I know it's not convenient out here.

405
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:21,490
没有问题
Not a problem.

406
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,940
在这种情况下
Under the circumstances.

407
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,390
-我们依然一切  -照旧
- And we still keep everything-- - Looking normal.

408
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,520
该死的朝琪
Cocksucking Chalky.

409
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,370
他自作自受
He made his bed.

410
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,220
车里发生了什么事
The fuck happened in that car?

411
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:47,020
他逃了  躺在某条臭水沟里
He's on the lam, facedown in a ditch somewhere.

412
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,580
为什么  我没有警告过他吗
For what? Didn't I warn him?

413
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,530
我还坐在那谁的对面
And now I'm sitting across from... whatever he is.

414
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:56,730
-博士还是啥  -他在告诉我该做什么
- Doctor or something. - He's telling me what I have to do?

415
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:59,030
-告诉我  -就像你是他儿子
- Telling me. - Like you're his boy.

416
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,590
和平是他妈的无稽之谈
There is no goddamn peace.

417
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:11,350
上次我们勉强摆平
We squeaked by last time.

418
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,940
你准备好再来一次吗
You ready for that again?

419
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,560
我刚虎落平阳  这就是你的建议
I just roll over? That's what you suggest?

420
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:19,700
听我说
Hear me out.

421
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:22,450
让大家坐下来
Let's get everyone to sit down--

422
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:24,910
我们  纽约  佛罗里达
us, New York, Florida.

423
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,170
-共商大计  -就一点...
- Work out terms. - Just a friendly little--

424
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:28,640
那晚在丽兹  是你自己说的
You said it yourself that night in the Ritz,

425
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,400
同心协力  共谋计策
all work together, take the next step.

426
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,270
现在是时候了吧
Maybe now's the time.

427
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:36,290
结束这种状况  让一切还原
Get the rules in place, put an end to this.

428
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,990
我不住丽兹了
I'm not in the Ritz anymore.

429
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:39,600
你不想抢回来吗
Don't you want it back?

430
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,280
我想  全部拿回来
I want it back. All of it.

431
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:47,450
做好准备吧  努基  趁还有人可以用
Set it up now, Nuck, while there's still a hand to play.

432
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,490
你不信任谁
Who don't you trust?

433
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:04,350
-什么  -我们这边  你不信任谁
- Huh? - On our side, who don't you trust?

434
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,910
你为什么这么问
Why are you even asking?

435
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,360
因为好奇
Because I'm curious.

436
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,730
巴德
Bader.

437
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,640
巴德算个屁
Bader's nothing.

438
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:17,550
我会处理好巴德
I'll deal with Bader.

439
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:21,220
米恩斯说  我这边有内鬼
Means told me there's a skunk in my cellar.

440
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,360
那个司法人员
The Justice guy?

441
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,960
他自始自终都是个骗子  
He's a bunco artist, start to finish.

442
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,390
他说二十万  你相信吗
200 grand, he says. Believe that?

443
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:30,330
-看吧  -他有什么
- There you go. - But what's he got?

444
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:32,310
钱给他  查清楚  你觉得值得
Pay him and find out, you think it's worth it.

445
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:36,510
禁酒探员
The Prohee.

446
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:42,700
-诺克斯  -你也关心过
- Knox? - You had concerns.

447
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:46,980
只是因为埃迪出了事
Uh... that was just during the whole Eddie thing.

448
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:49,580
谁知道出了什么事
Who knew what was going on?

449
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:51,760
你的看法是什么
What's your take, though?

450
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,880
据我所知  他喜欢钱
Far as I can see, he likes the money.

451
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:59,510
某天他会成为你的麻烦
Be your headache one day.

452
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,930
我的麻烦
Mine?

453
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,010
不过你可以处理好
And you can deal with all of it.

454
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:06,800
你要去哪里
You off somewhere?

455
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:12,560
妈妈问你把保暖锅放哪里去了
Ma wants to know where you keep the chafing dishes.

456
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,200
只是关于它的价值 不过没关系
It's a fraction of what it's worth, but it doesn't matter.

457
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:25,210
你自己说的  太大了
You said it yourself-- it's too big.

458
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:26,420
对这里来说太大了
It's too big for here.

459
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,590
那些人都不到城里来了
Those people don't come to town anymore.

460
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:31,170
毕竟是一大笔钱
And it's a substantial sum, after all.

461
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:33,730
大家真的需要多少钱呢
I mean, how much does anybody really need?

462
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,410
他会好起来的  他会的
And he'll be better off. He will be.

463
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,120
话糙  但是这是事实
It hurts to say it, but I know it's true.

464
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,060
也许某一天
And maybe someday...

465
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,520
我瞎扯呢
I'm nattering.

466
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:48,010
这不太招人喜欢
Not an appealing quality.

467
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,630
我住嘴  我吃东西
I'm stopping. I'm eating.

468
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:52,730
好姑娘
Good girl.

469
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,340
你做出了正确的决定  我为你高兴
Well, you made the right decision. I'm happy for you.

470
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,780
可你看起来并不高兴
You don't look happy.

471
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,560
是吗
I don't?

472
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:06,670
有意思
That's funny.

473
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,780
终于得到我想要的东西了
Got what I wanted, finally.

474
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,660
什么东西
What's that?

475
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:16,220
收购的事儿
Merger's going through.

476
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:19,820
A&P会以高昂的价格买下我们的产权
A&P's gonna buy us out for a pretty staggering price.

477
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:21,990
罗伊
Roy.

478
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:23,680
这让我有点不安
It had me on edge for--

479
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:26,170
其实很不安  我现在可以说
well, more than a little, I can say that now.

480
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:29,260
结果半路杀出个休森
Turns out it was Hewson who was standing in the way.

481
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,620
我  我不明白
I-- I don't--

482
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,690
我们还和他以及他妻子喝东西
While we had drinks with him and his wife?

483
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,940
-当你和我假装夫妻的时候  -是的...
- When you and I were married? - Yes, from...

484
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,390
从印第安纳来的那位
Indiana. Anyway...

485
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:39,890
他表面上说好听的
He was pouring honey in my ear,

486
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:41,850
可是从一开始他就反对
but he was against it from the start.

487
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,800
有大人物给他送酒
The muckety-mucks gave him the boot.

488
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:48,280
可他不低调  不过他后来一帆风顺
He didn't go quietly, but after that, smooth sailing.

489
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,250
律师们昨天签字了
The lawyers signed off yesterday.

490
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,900
对我来说是好消息
Big bonus for me.

491
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:55,360
我们庆祝一番如何
Why aren't we celebrating?

492
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,690
我不知道
I don't know.

493
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,340
我不喜欢结束
I hate when things end.

494
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:02,990
什么结束
What's ending?

495
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:05,360
我来这里的目的
What I came here for.

496
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:08,280
你要去哪里
Where are you going?

497
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,480
他们送我去哪儿我就去哪儿
Wherever they send me.

498
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,070
你对我撒过谎吗
Have you been lying to me?

499
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:21,060
-关于什么  -你的妻子
- About what? - Your wife.

500
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:24,260
我没有撒谎
I didn't lie about that.

501
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:29,520
那你要说什么
Then what are you saying?

502
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:35,330
你经历了太多
You have been through so much,

503
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:37,460
我甚至都无法想象的事情
things I can't even imagine.

504
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,680
你已经非常勇敢了  真的
You're very brave. I mean that.

505
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,060
此时你看起来非常美丽
And right now you look so beautiful.

506
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,090
真是个美好的道别
What an awfully gallant good-bye.

507
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,710
我不是道别
I'm not saying good-bye.

508
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,680
我是得离开
I do have to leave.

509
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:56,940
但我要你跟我一起走
I want you to come with me.

510
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:58,500
我要你嫁给我
I want you to marry me.

511
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,410
真的嫁给我
Really marry me.

512
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:03,220
这就是我的心愿
That's what I want.

513
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:09,480
那你为什么不问我呢
What's stopping you from asking?

514
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,830
刚刚不是问了吗
Hell, I thought I just did.

515
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,660
-他做什么呢  -我不应该说的
- What does he do? - I'm not supposed to talk about it.

516
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:25,300
-不能告诉你的家人吗  -我能吗
- If you can't tell your family... - Should I?

517
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:26,950
我得说  我们做事儿
I'd say we're all pretty good

518
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:28,830
都非常小心谨慎
at keeping things close to the vest.

519
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,730
-你们不能吧  -我会保守秘密的
- Not sure about you. - I can keep my mouth shut.

520
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,590
-不  你不能  -你刚刚都说漏嘴了
- No, you can't. - You just said something.

521
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,550
-我不知道已经开始了  -告诉我们
- I didn't know we started. - Tell us.

522
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:37,840
他锁了办公室的门
Well, he shuts his office door,

523
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,170
脱了裤子到处走
walks around with his trousers off.

524
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:42,270
市长
The mayor?

525
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,320
不想把裤子弄皱了
Doesn't want to get 'em wrinkled.

526
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,270
我觉得是一个会赢的竞选战略
Sounds to me like a winning campaign strategy.

527
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:47,980
不清楚  我觉得巴卡拉克会大获全胜
I don't know. I think Bacharach might beat the pants off him.

528
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:47,980
{\an8}会把他赢得裤子也不剩

529
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:52,800
很好吧
Pretty good, huh?

530
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,140
下一站  钢铁码[娱乐场所]
Next stop: the Steel Pier.

531
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,200
大获全胜
"Beat the pants off him."

532
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,530
他可以去说相声了
He could be in vaudeville.

533
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:00,020
康凯特医生! 康凯特医生!
"Dr. Kronkheit! Dr. Kronkheit!"

534
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,840
我的脖子有风湿病
"I got rheumatism on the back of my neck."

535
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:05,650
-真像  -那是什么意思
- That's him to a T. - What's that supposed to mean?

536
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:08,110
动一下指头  就是世界末日
Every little sniffle, it's the end of the world.

537
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:09,400
这才不是我
This is not me at all.

538
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,540
那个买保险的肯定有你的电话
That insurance salesman sure had your number.

539
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,140
耍的他团团转
Played him like a fiddle.

540
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,650
你家出什么事了
"What happens to your family?

541
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:17,830
汤普森先生  我认识一个和你一样的人
Mr. Thompson, I know a fella just like you--"

542
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:18,900
凡事早想一步肯定没错
Nothing wrong with planning ahead.

543
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,790
真正的蓝眼娃娃脸
Real blue-eyed baby face, you know?

544
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:21,950
唱诗班少年那样
Choirboy type.

545
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,850
没想到他只想把最贵的卖给你
Wouldn't think all he wants to do is sell you the most expensive

546
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:27,020
琼  你能不能给我闭嘴
June, just shut your goddamn trap for once.

547
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,520
行吗  闭嘴
Okay? Just shut it.

548
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:42,200
别调侃了  就这样
Enough with the teasing. That's all.

549
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:02,470
给我在巴尔默来次约会
Got me a "Round-day-voos" In "Balmer."

550
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:03,390
别碰我
Get away from me, boy.

551
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:04,740
别让我找你麻烦
Don't let me keep you.

552
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,830
又一个小时  把手拿开
Ain't for another hour. Get your hands off me.

553
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:09,800
-然后继续玩你的  -住手
- Then play like you playing. - Stop.

554
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:13,370
就是不舒服
Can't get settled.

555
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:16,790
他怎么样
He doin' all right in there?

556
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,590
他累坏了
He get real tired around now,

557
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:22,570
但是不想躺下
but he don't like to lay down.

558
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:23,880
发发牢骚
Fussin'.

559
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:27,320
-老小孩一样  -什么
- Old man and a baby. - What's that?

560
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,690
老人和小孩一样
Different and the same.

561
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:30,440
小孩还有一辈子要走
Baby got their whole life in front of 'em.

562
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,200
而且不会花钱就能啃奶子
Plus he ain't got to pay to suck on no tittie.

563
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,790
这话别说出来
Keep your problems to yourself.

564
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,370
你想打架吗
You gonna make a move?

565
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,010
你赢了  回头见

你是大人物
So you the biggety man?

573

-怎么讲  -叔叔说的

-我有自己的生意  -给我讲讲你的事

575
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:41,260
是吗

576
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:43,410
比如你怎么伤的
Like you blood.

577
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:45,890
那么
Well...

578
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:49,340
我们得回去

579
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,870
我什么都不怕
I ain't afraid or nothin'.

580

到你了
Your move.

581
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,050
你来玩一会

不喜欢我做的菜
Doesn't like my cooking.

583
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:47,930
口味不一样而已
From a different time, that all.

584
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:49,770
是吗
Is he, though?

585
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:58,030

586
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:02,480
-等待  -等什么
- Waiting. - For what?

587

你有家  有个待嫁的女儿

588
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:09,040
现在这些对我来说还有什么意义
What that matter to me now?

589
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,770
你只想着退出
You only think you quit.

590
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:12,110
我难道不知道自己的想法吗
Don't I know what I feel?

591
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:16,790
你想那些人死
You want those men dead.

592
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:20,030
你的敌人  和被你看成是朋友的那个人
The one who's your enemy and the one you called a friend...

593
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:21,770
不是吗

594
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:30,660
你不过是个睡在摇篮里的宝贝
You wasn't nothing but a baby in that Storyville crib.

595
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:33,940
-不是  -是谁救了你
- No. - Who the man that save you?

596

我告诉过你  是医生

597
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,350
那又是谁害死你母亲的

我不知道我的名字
I didn't know my name.

599
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,870
他叫我道特  我就是道特
He called me Daughter, and that's who I am.

600
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,810
我们走吧
Let's leave.

601
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,150
现在就走
Right now.

602
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:01,100
我们离开这里  再也不回来
Let's run and never look back.

603
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:06,980
你只要答应就可以

604
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,390
叔叔找你

605
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:17,220
他很不安心

00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,780
-你能选择去哪吗  -你喜欢哪
- Do you get to choose where? - Well, where would you like?

607
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,700
离这越远越好
Whatever is farthest from here.

608

-日本  -稍微近点的

加利福尼亚
Uh, California.

610
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,500
我们的房子会是什么样的
What's our house gonna look like?

611
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:37,040
比你现在的小点
It'll be smaller than the one you have now.

612
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,160
-不  但是不要太小  -我会保证让你住着舒服的
- No, but not too small. - No, I'll make sure it suits you.

613
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,960
我自己也有钱
I'll have my own money, you know.

614
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,750
你就自己留着需要的时候用吧
You're gonna hold on to that for when you need it.

615
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:45,340
你想让我依靠你

我想让你感觉和现在一样自由

617
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,130
我们该走了
We should go.

618
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:02,350
我把车开出来  方便你上车

619
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:10,190
钥匙不见了
The key's hiding somewhere.

620
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,060
在这

624
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:34,170

00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:42,490
-你和你的婊子一起  -这话太过分了
- You and your whore there. - Hey, that's over the line.

628
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:43,540
我过分
I'm over the line?

629
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:45,600
我因为你失去了工作
I lost my job because of you,

630
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,210
你这个背后下刀的混蛋

631

都十五年了
After 15 years.

632
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:52,680
-罗伊  别这样  -我现在还有什么
- Roy, don't. - What do I have now?

633
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,540
我这就让你感受下生活被毁掉的感觉
I'll show you how it feels to have your life ruined.

634
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:57,760
-你给我退后  -罗伊  别
- You back off. - Roy, no.

635
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,840
-罗伊  -我要让你知道失去一切的
- Roy. - I'll show you how it feels to lose everything--

636
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:07,250
我以为他会
I thought he would--

637
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:09,700
我以为他有
I thought he had a...

638
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,910
罗伊  我们该走了
Roy, we need to go.

639
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:13,960
-我们该走了  -我不该开枪的
- We need to go. - I should hang on to that.

640
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,320
去开车  赶紧  快去
You need to drive. Go. Hurry.

641
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,750
上车
Get in.

00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,550
快点
Hurry.

643
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,440
你被抓住了
You're caught.

644
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,350
别担心  我们会一起受罚
Don't worry, we'll both go down together.

645
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,260
你觉得刚才是怎么回事
What do you think that was about?

646
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,120
我不会太当回事
I wouldn't take it too seriously.

647
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:57,800
你父亲脾气就是比较冲
It's always been pretty easy to get your father's goat.

648
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:58,980
真的吗
Really?

649
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,420
你跟他提玛丽·安·诺兰试试
Just mention Mary Anne Nolan to him.

650
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:04,610
-那是谁  -八年级的时候爱上的姑娘
- Who's she? - Eighth grade crush.

651
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:06,950
他给她写了首诗
He wrote her a poem.

652
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:09,880
我看到的时候真是乐坏了
Happy day when I found it.

653
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,110
不能怪他担心
Can't blame him for worrying, though.

654
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:17,660
你得想想你离开之后会是怎样
You have to think about what's gonna happen after you're gone.

655
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:19,550
为了你们全家好
For the sake of all of you.

656
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,440
那个卖保险的
That insurance fella, though--

657
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:24,960
听上去很像个骗子
sounds like a real sharpie.

658
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:27,520
我没怎么听全
I didn't hear very much of it.

659
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:30,990
-你见过他  -打了个照面
- You met him? - Just for a minute.

660
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,800
和你母亲说的一样
Like your mother said?

661
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:35,870
-什么  -娃娃脸
- What? - Baby face?

662
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:38,690
算是吧
Yeah, I guess.

663
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,260
以前见过他吗
Ever see him before?

664
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,180
没有
No.

665
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:44,880
你确定
You're sure now?

666
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,760
你和我说的话  威尔  跟谁也别提
Whatever you tell me, Will, it's just between us.

667
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:53,170
这个我们之前就说过了
That's what we agreed to.

668
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,860
努基伯父  我
Uncle Nucky, I...

669
00:40:58,820 --> 00:40:59,540
该死
Shit.

670
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,020
我什么也没看到
I don't notice anything.

671
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:03,980
只是在感受海风
Just taking in the breeze.

672
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,980
姑娘们和我把一切都收拾好了
The girls and I put everything away.

673
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:08,660
你不用这么做
You didn't have to do that.

674
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,750
看着干净了我心理舒服
I feel better knowing the place is tidy.

675
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,230
我睡不着
I can't hardly sleep.

676
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,780
这些多余的时间
All this, uh, extra time,

677
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,970
老了之后无事可做的时间
you know, when you get old, you ain't got nothing to do with it.

678
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:28,970
你说了  该做的都做了
You said done was done.

679
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:30,800
是啊  可是这不意味着我得喜欢这样
Yeah, but it don't mean I have to like it.

680
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,720
给孩子们一些活干
Got the boys runnin' some action.

681
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:37,420
酿点私酒  搞搞赌局
You know, a little moonshining, some numbers--

682
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:40,250
但是没多少钱
eh, but it don't amount to much.

683
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:42,160
你的钱去哪了
Where your money go?

684
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,660
我本来挣的就不多
I didn't make half as much as you think.

685
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:47,800
准将给我什么我就接什么
I took in what the Commodore let me take in.

686
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,000
没多少选择
I had no choice.

687
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:51,480
他死了  三年了
He gone now, three year back.

688
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:55,070
我可不想念他  一点也不想
Man, I don't miss him. I do not miss him.

689
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:02,270
但是你在和那个叫汤普森的做生意
But you did your business with the Thompson boy, though.

690
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:06,120
-帮了他不少忙  -是啊
- Help him plenty. - Mm-hmm.

691
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:08,330
他怎么回报你的
Now how did that buckra pay you back?

692
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,240
我现在该做什么  奥斯卡
What I do now, Oscar?

693
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:17,910
你待在这  干出一番事业
You stay here, you build something up.

694
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:20,200
这是你侄子的地方
That's for your nephew.

695
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:22,510
温斯顿没什么大出息
Winston ain't never gonna amount to nothing.

696
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:25,310
你待在这  趁那个女人没给你惹上麻烦之前
You stay here, and cut that woman loose

697
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:27,340
把她赶走
'fore she do you in proper.

698
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:28,890
她和这事没关系
She ain't to blame for this.

699
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:30,510
如果不是她  那就是你
And if she ain't, then you are.

700
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:35,340
算了  你想怎样就怎么样
Well, damn, you do what you want.

701
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:38,260
最后结果都是一样的
It all winds up the same anyway.

702
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:41,050
这话什么意思
What that mean?

703
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:45,800
等到那一天到来的时候  大家都会四散而逃
The day come, everybody gonna run out of road.

704
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:59,450
-有什么要说的吗  -什么
- Any parting words? - Like what?

705
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,750
-我们  -我们很感谢您
