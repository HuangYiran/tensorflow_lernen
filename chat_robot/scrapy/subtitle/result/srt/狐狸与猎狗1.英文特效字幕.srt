{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tod!

217
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,430
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Amos Slade, you trigger-happy lunatic!

218
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,350
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give me that gun!

219
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,270
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My radiator!

220
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,630
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why, you blasted female.

221
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,420
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'll... I'll... - Hold it right there!

222
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,950
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Watch it! That thing's loaded!

223
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,030
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now it ain't loaded!

224
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:25,110
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dagnabit, woman! Your thievin' fox was after my chickens!

225
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,470
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rubbish and poppycock!

226
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,470
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't believe it. He wouldn't hurt a thing.

227
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:34,150
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You callin' me a liar, you muddleheaded female?

228
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,150
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I saw it happen! - Amos Slade, that temper of yours

229
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,470
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is going to get you into a lot of trouble.

230
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,830
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Temper?

231
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:44,030
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Temper, woman? You ain't seen my temper!

232
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:49,830
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I ever catch that fox on my property again, I'll blast him!

233
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,950
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And next time, I won't miss!

234
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Poor little tyke.

235
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,110
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a shame I have to keep him cooped up.

236
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,190
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tod, stop looking at me like that.

237
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,710
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not my fault, you know.

238
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,430
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You caused a lot of trouble yesterday.

239
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,630
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, now what are they up to?

240
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,270
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why, it looks like Amos is going on a hunting trip.

241
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A long one, from the looks of it.

242
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, good riddance!

243
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,230
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Doggone meddlin' female,

244
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,590
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}shootin' up my radiator!

245
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,270
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad blame it. Get goin'!

246
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,990
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There. Well, that's more like it. Keep runnin', old girl.

247
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:12,230
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, Copper, me and old Chief are gonna teach you all about huntin'.

248
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,670
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, sir. It's about time too.

249
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,030
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Attaboy.

250
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:23,510
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, you're gonna like trackin' down those varmints for me.

251
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,510
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get in the back, half-pint.

252
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,590
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You gotta earn your right to sit up front.

253
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, boys, we're gettin' outta here till next spring.

254
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,510
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tod, honey, what are you doin' over here?

255
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,470
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gee, I just wanted to say goodbye to Copper,

256
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,190
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I'm too late.

257
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:33,230
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, what did you plan to do if you ran into old Chief?

258
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:39,990
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chief. I can outfox that dumb old dog anytime.

259
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,380
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tod, now hold it just one minute.

260
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,150
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Didn't you learn anything yesterday?

261
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,230
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now you listen good, Tod,

262
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,880
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because it's either education or elimination.

263
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,510
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now if you're so foxy and old Chief's so dumb,

264
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,190
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then why does that hound get the fox on the run?

265
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,670
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}'Cause he's got the hunter, and the hunter's got the gun.

266
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,110
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Elimination. Lack of education.

267
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,750
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you pal around with that Copper hound

268
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,190
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll wind up hangin' on the wall

269
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keep your nose to the wind You'll keep your skin

270
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,270
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}'Cause you won't be home when the hunter comes to call

271
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:22,990
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Big Mama, I know Copper would never track me down.

272
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:26,390
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why, old Copper, he's my best friend.

273
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,390
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your best friend.

274
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, Copper's gonna do what he's been told.

275
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,990
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Supposed to chase the little old fox into the old foxhole,

276
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:37,230
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then along comes the hunter with a buckshot load.

277
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,550
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Elimination.

278
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lack of education.

279
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,070
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You better believe it, Tod.

280
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,030
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, sirree!

281
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:51,110
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You mean Copper is gonna be my enemy?

282
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,790
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey!

283
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,830
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kid, you better step over here and take a good look.

284
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,310
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why... Why, that's awful.

285
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,660
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Those poor things.

286
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,070
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, Tod.

287
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:20,110
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honey, Copper's gonna come back a trained huntin' dog.

288
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,660
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A real killer.

289
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,950
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no, not my friend Copper.

290
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,990
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He won't ever change.

291
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,310
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hope you're right, Tod.

292
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,990
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And we'll keep on being friends forever.

293
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,670
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Won't we, Big Mama?

294
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:41,670
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Darlin', forever is a long, long time,

295
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,110
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and time has a way of changin' things.

296
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:52,350
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Jiminy. It sure turned cold.

297
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,510
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm freezin' my b... - Hey!

298
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,510
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's that fuzzy worm! Let's get him!

299
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,750
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Charge!

300
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,550
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Dinky! Dinky, quick! Over here!

301
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,550
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got him! I got him!

302
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:17,670
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do I look like a worm? That's who we're after.

303
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,870
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on!

304
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,430
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at that little creep,

305
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,710
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}warm and cozy by the fire.

306
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,180
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me take a look.

307
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,030
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now how do you like that guy?

308
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,390
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Snug as a bug,

309
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:43,150
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}while we're out here freezin' our beaks off.

310
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:47,350
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yackin' and shiverin' ain't gettin' us anywhere.

311
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,830
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll get that no-good worm when we come back.

312
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,510
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, shucks.

313
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,830
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So long, Big Mama.

314
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,790
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, we're goin' south for the winter.

315
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,950
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Goodbye, boys. See ya next spring.

316

318
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,630
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, Tod, honey.

319
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,750
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I hope... - Hiya, Big Mama.

320
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,990
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're back. We flew all the way.

321
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,030
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, we did. We did.

{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And it's all my fault.

430
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:51,030
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I shouldn't have let Tod go.

438
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,510

440
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,310
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't come bargin' onto my property, Amos Slade!

441
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:40,510
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That fox of yours almost killed Chief,

442

{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't keep him locked up forever!

444
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:00,350


445
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:07,790
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We met, it seems

446
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:10,150
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Such a short time ago

00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:14,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You looked at me

448
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Needing me so

449
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:21,510
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yet from your sadness

450
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:24,510
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our happiness grew

451

{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I found out I needed you too

452
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:34,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I remember how we used to play

453
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:42,430
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I recall those rainy days

454
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:47,230
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The fire 's glow

458
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:01,510
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Goodbye may seem forever

459
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:04,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Farewell is like the end

460
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:09,510
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But in my heart's the memory

{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And there you 'll always be

466
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,150
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold it, sonny! Back off!

467

515
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:50,260
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just look at the mess you made.

516
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:56,390

521
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:11,300
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You shouldn't be so grumpy to someone who's new in the neighbourhood.

522
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,960
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A stranger?

523
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:16,630
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why don't you go back where you came from?

01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:19,590
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wha...?

525
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:27,950
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, go on.

{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, you can't blame him, honey.

529
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:08,430
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was dropped out here and left all alone without a friend in the world.

530
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:10,820
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, maybe there's something I could do.

531
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:12,830
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, cheer him up.

532
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:16,460
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honey, you just said the magic words.

533
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:22,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now...

534
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,270
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? But Big Mama, I don't...

535
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:31,190
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Darlin', don't move. You look beautiful.
