1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,089
<i>Previously on Hostages...</i>

2
00:00:02,089 --> 00:00:05,060
My name is Agent Hoffman. I'm with the Secret Service.

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:06,824
I think someone is threatening your family.

4
00:00:07,896 --> 00:00:10,300
This is Vanessa Moore. My sister.

5
00:00:10,822 --> 00:00:12,344
Vanessa, have you met Colonel Blair?

6
00:00:12,344 --> 00:00:15,977
Not in person, but I read about your appointment to the NSA.

7
00:00:15,977 --> 00:00:18,887
I loved your brother very much. He would have been President someday.

8
00:00:18,887 --> 00:00:20,600
He would have been President now.

9
00:00:21,137 --> 00:00:24,623
Our mutual friend is here.
I wanted to keep her in the loop.

10
00:00:26,374 --> 00:00:27,263
Hello, Quentin.

11
00:00:28,146 --> 00:00:30,027
This is a conspiracy that goes way beyond Duncan.

12
00:00:30,538 --> 00:00:31,507
What makes you believe him?

13
00:00:31,507 --> 00:00:36,066
Open your eyes, Brian, the FBI, the Secret Service this is bigger than any one man.

14
00:00:36,066 --> 00:00:39,287
We need to know exactly when Kincaid plans to go public, and that is on you.

15
00:00:39,287 --> 00:00:41,217
And what if that's before the scheduled surgery?

16
00:00:41,217 --> 00:00:43,474
Well, we re-evaluate where we stand with everything.

17
00:00:43,474 --> 00:00:44,851
I say we start with his family.

18
00:00:44,851 --> 00:00:48,251
- He warned you to stay away from his daughter. - That's why I'm going after his wife.

19
00:00:48,825 --> 00:00:50,625
Your wife is a very sick woman.

20
00:00:52,147 --> 00:00:53,678
I took the safety valve off.

21
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:57,377
I can dump 20 cc of morphine into her before you take another step.

22
00:00:57,377 --> 00:00:59,845
- She's innocent. - So is my family.

23
00:01:01,709 --> 00:01:05,038
Ellen, I know you're upset, that you want answers.

24
00:01:05,038 --> 00:01:07,983
- Why are you doing this? - The reason doesn't matter.

25
00:01:07,983 --> 00:01:10,504
- It does to me. - Put down the morphine.

26
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:12,885
Please.

27
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,454
You don't want to kill an innocent woman.

28
00:01:17,187 --> 00:01:18,296
Like Angela?

29
00:01:19,839 --> 00:01:23,121
- Like the President? - He's not innocent.

30
00:01:24,029 --> 00:01:27,138
You get to decide who's innocent and who's guilty. Who gets to live.

31
00:01:28,575 --> 00:01:30,121
Who are you? God?

32
00:01:32,003 --> 00:01:34,655
Excuse me? What are you doing?

33
00:01:34,655 --> 00:01:38,865
- Why are you touching her IV? - Henry, it's okay, I uh...

34
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:43,165
I ran into Dr. Sanders in the hallway, and asked her to check on the drip.

35
00:01:43,165 --> 00:01:46,090
Nina was complaining of pain earlier in the evening.

36
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:49,207
- Is there a problem with her drip line? - No.

37
00:01:49,765 --> 00:01:51,117
It's all working fine now.

38
00:01:56,772 --> 00:01:59,541
You said the President is not innocent, what did you mean?

39
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:01,021
We can discuss that later.

40
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:07,025
Right now, you need to get home to your daughter.

41
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:10,991
- Why? - Morgan's boyfriend came by the house.

42
00:02:12,097 --> 00:02:13,241
He brought a gun.

43
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,324
Oh, my God.

44
00:02:21,222 --> 00:02:24,307
What are you talking about? Why would you think my family is being threatened?

45
00:02:24,307 --> 00:02:27,290
Let's just say your wife is the common denominator

46
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:30,844
in a series of coincidences that all connect to the President.

47
00:02:31,509 --> 00:02:32,828
What are you suggesting?

48
00:02:32,828 --> 00:02:36,493
Your wife is a respected doctor.

49
00:02:36,493 --> 00:02:38,198
An exemplary citizen.

50
00:02:38,198 --> 00:02:42,507
And she has no reason to assassinate the President, unless she's being coerced.

51
00:02:54,438 --> 00:02:56,334
No one else knows that you're here.

52
00:02:56,908 --> 00:02:59,945
So this is your chance to speak openly.

53
00:03:02,962 --> 00:03:04,020
I...

54
00:03:08,902 --> 00:03:10,709
I don't know what you're talking about.

55
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:13,657
Everything's fine. Nobody's threatening us.

56
00:03:15,974 --> 00:03:20,351
Okay. Sorry to have taken up your time, Mr. Sanders.

57
00:03:21,255 --> 00:03:22,347
You can go.

58
00:03:27,915 --> 00:03:28,733
Thank you.

59
00:03:31,233 --> 00:03:33,042
Boyd loved me.

60
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:36,714
I know.

61
00:03:37,535 --> 00:03:40,409
I know, sweetheart. I am so sorry.

62
00:03:46,607 --> 00:03:48,783
- You did this. - No.

63
00:03:51,602 --> 00:03:53,037
He protected me.

64
00:04:07,167 --> 00:04:08,257
You okay?

65
00:04:09,236 --> 00:04:10,061
Yeah.

66
00:04:11,137 --> 00:04:14,309
The vest stops the bullet, but it still hurts like a son of a bitch.

67
00:04:16,482 --> 00:04:17,865
But I've been through worse.

68
00:04:26,665 --> 00:04:28,095
You could have been killed.

69
00:04:58,925 --> 00:05:01,163
Secret Service Headquarters

70
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:11,065
You need to start collecting stamps or something.

71
00:05:13,798 --> 00:05:16,423
I thought the interview with the husband was a bust last night.

72
00:05:16,423 --> 00:05:20,735
I'm not looking at Dr. Sanders right now, but I am looking at the hospital.

73
00:05:20,735 --> 00:05:23,003
You have to ask yourself, "Why would the White House

74
00:05:23,003 --> 00:05:24,817
"pick Maryland College Hospital?"

75
00:05:25,395 --> 00:05:28,888
There was a rigorous selection process. We looked into all this.

76
00:05:28,888 --> 00:05:30,945
I started over last night.

77
00:05:30,945 --> 00:05:34,799
- I think somebody might have rigged the game. - What are you talking about?

78
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:42,280
"Maryland College Hospital incident report.

79
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,053
"Filed September 4th with the joint commissioner. "

80
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:49,206
Hospitals file these things annually. They report fatalities, injuries.

81
00:05:49,206 --> 00:05:53,424
Now this one, the White House copy, shows 245 negative incidents.

82
00:05:53,424 --> 00:05:56,660
The Maryland College Hospital copy shows 479.

83
00:06:02,051 --> 00:06:03,817
Why would someone change the number?

84
00:06:03,817 --> 00:06:06,655
To make sure the President wound up at this particular hospital.

85
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,873
I have a Bill Jones on the line. He says it's urgent.

86
00:06:17,321 --> 00:06:19,986
- Hello. - We need to talk. Now.

87
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:21,854
I'll call you back.

88
00:06:30,693 --> 00:06:34,748
You have to be kidding me. He's cross-referencing hospital filings?

89
00:06:34,748 --> 00:06:36,743
Like I said, he's thorough.

90
00:06:36,743 --> 00:06:41,141
He thinks someone on the inside influenced the decision to use Dr. Sanders.

91
00:06:41,141 --> 00:06:44,811
- Did he mention my name? - Not yet, but it's only a matter of time.

95
00:07:14,286 --> 00:07:17,547
So, what, Hoffman just brought you into his office to ask questions?

96
00:07:17,547 --> 00:07:20,366
He wanted to know if anyone was threatening us.

97
00:07:20,366 --> 00:07:22,997
He's a smart guy. Pretty much figured out what's going on.

98
00:07:22,997 --> 00:07:25,930
- What did you say? - I said everything is great.

99
00:07:26,686 --> 00:07:27,908
Did he believe you?

100
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:30,679
I think so, but...

101
00:07:30,679 --> 00:07:32,771
- He's relentless. - Maybe it's a good thing.

102
00:07:32,771 --> 00:07:34,359
We've been through this.

103
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:37,779
If we talk to any kind of law enforcement, it's basically suicide.

104
00:07:37,779 --> 00:07:40,611
Look, I know what we agreed to but maybe we're wrong.

105
00:07:40,611 --> 00:07:43,689
Maybe it's smarter to bet on Hoffman to get us out of this.

106
00:07:43,689 --> 00:07:45,233
I'd rather bet on myself.

107
00:07:47,549 --> 00:07:50,364
Ellen. We need to talk.

108
00:08:00,733 --> 00:08:03,491
I just got word, you'll be using the OR on the fourth floor.

109
00:08:04,006 --> 00:08:06,325
Fourth? My surgeries are always on the fifth.

110
00:08:06,325 --> 00:08:08,669
Not this one. Rules have changed.

111
00:08:10,227 --> 00:08:15,152
You need to deposit this in the scrub room on the fourth floor, locker 715.

112
00:08:15,152 --> 00:08:16,550
By 11:30.

113
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:19,358
After that, the fourth floor will be on lockdown.

114
00:08:19,358 --> 00:08:20,647
Full body searches.

115
00:08:22,834 --> 00:08:25,629
An associate will make sure it's not discovered.

116
00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:28,578
Locker 715, fourth floor.

117
00:08:28,578 --> 00:08:29,951
11:30.

118
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,250
TEXT MESSAGE
From Washington DC:
Park. 10 minutes.

119
00:08:58,216 --> 00:09:00,933
Hoffman. He's obsessed.

120
00:09:00,933 --> 00:09:02,654
He's been sleeping in the office.

121
00:09:02,654 --> 00:09:05,650
Analyzing documents, statistics.

122
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:06,845
How close is he?

123
00:09:07,554 --> 00:09:09,395
Close enough that he needs to go.

124
00:09:10,863 --> 00:09:11,740
Go?

125
00:09:13,246 --> 00:09:14,658
That's what I've been told.

126
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:25,510
- You think that's the right move? - Doesn't matter what I think.

127
00:09:29,234 --> 00:09:30,632
6 Months Ago

128
00:09:35,046 --> 00:09:36,275
Carlisle?

129
00:09:37,684 --> 00:09:39,547
I think we have a mutual friend.

130
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,543
- Oh, yeah? Who's that? - The guy who plays tennis.

131
00:09:48,043 --> 00:09:51,006
Once the President flatlines, we're going to need five minutes alone.

132
00:09:52,612 --> 00:09:56,162
- For what? - Not your concern.

133
00:09:57,936 --> 00:09:59,585
Five minutes is a long time.

134
00:09:59,585 --> 00:10:01,612
Our friend said you could make it happen.

135
00:10:02,456 --> 00:10:07,249
I'll work on it. Is this going to be an issue?

136
00:10:07,249 --> 00:10:09,940
- Yes or no? - No.

137
00:10:16,714 --> 00:10:19,638
It's not easy to take out a Secret Service agent.

138
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:22,395
We'll need your help with this.

139
00:10:25,352 --> 00:10:26,936
Is there going to be a problem with that?

140
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,452
No.

141
00:10:38,811 --> 00:10:41,194
- Hey! - Hey, how are you?

142
00:10:41,194 --> 00:10:42,339
Good.

143
00:10:42,339 --> 00:10:47,119
But things are crazy at home with college applications.

144
00:10:47,119 --> 00:10:48,615
Where's Morgan applying?

145
00:10:50,122 --> 00:10:54,522
Columbia and Dartmouth are her favorites, so...

146
00:10:54,522 --> 00:10:57,523
- We'll see. - Oh, she was always so smart.

147
00:10:57,523 --> 00:11:00,816
How's she doing these days? I bet she's absolutely beautiful.

148
00:11:00,816 --> 00:11:02,857
She is terrific.

149
00:11:03,841 --> 00:11:05,212
Listen, I gotta run, huh?

150
00:11:05,728 --> 00:11:07,218
- Good to see you. - Good to see you, hon.

151
00:12:11,699 --> 00:12:12,898
How you holding up?

152
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:15,990
Okay.

153
00:12:25,283 --> 00:12:27,838
Look, I'm sorry I got you into this.

154
00:12:27,838 --> 00:12:30,986
No. You didn't. I asked to be a part of it.

155
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:37,453
I'd just never thought it would get to this. The nurse.

156
00:12:38,695 --> 00:12:40,490
The limo driver.

157
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:42,491
Now that kid, Boyd.

158
00:12:46,758 --> 00:12:51,265
- Let's just hope it ends there. - It won't.

159
00:12:53,471 --> 00:12:55,181
They're gonna take out Hoffman.

160
00:13:02,027 --> 00:13:03,540
Well, if that's what they want.

161
00:13:05,374 --> 00:13:07,285
There's nothing we can do about it.

162
00:13:07,285 --> 00:13:09,603
Unless I can convince him to drop the case.

163
00:13:10,381 --> 00:13:11,874
We're not criminals.

164
00:13:15,856 --> 00:13:19,393
I've been chasing a few leads, but I haven't found anything interesting.

165
00:13:19,393 --> 00:13:21,195
Not yet, but I'll keep digging.

166
00:13:21,195 --> 00:13:23,910
Good, because the answer's out there somewhere.

167
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,212
We just need to find it.

168
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:31,569
You disagree?

169
00:13:33,353 --> 00:13:36,721
In my experience, when I have to work too hard to find an answer,

170
00:13:36,721 --> 00:13:37,889
there isn't one.

171
00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:42,158
Maybe the reason we can't crack this case is because there's nothing to crack.

172
00:13:42,158 --> 00:13:44,339
What if Angela really did commit suicide?

173
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:47,536
She was depressed, she jumped off the bridge into the Chesapeake,

174
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:51,112
- and her body washed out to sea. - So, you think I've lost my mind?

175
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:53,770
I think certain people never know when to give up.

176
00:13:55,305 --> 00:14:00,035
You're probably right. I can be stubborn. But not on this one.

177
00:14:00,035 --> 00:14:02,903
I have a new lead and it points to someone in the White House.

178
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:05,607
- Oh, yeah? - Yeah.

179
00:14:07,617 --> 00:14:08,559
Excuse me.
(Incoming
Laura)

180
00:14:11,501 --> 00:14:14,995
Hello, sweetheart. Hey, listen, I can't talk right now.

181
00:14:15,557 --> 00:14:18,175
Great. I'll see you when I get home.

182
00:14:18,783 --> 00:14:20,281
Yeah, I love you.

183
00:14:23,977 --> 00:14:24,957
My wife.

184
00:14:25,675 --> 00:14:29,686
She gets nervous whenever we don't touch base a few times a day.

185
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:35,100
- How's she doing? - Not too good.

186
00:14:35,613 --> 00:14:36,809
Can't really blame her.

187
00:14:38,775 --> 00:14:42,246
It was him or you.
You did the right thing.

188
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,345
What else is going on?

189
00:14:50,345 --> 00:14:52,067
That guy still after you for the money?

190
00:14:53,206 --> 00:14:56,577
- You want some help with him? - Thanks, but I'm good for now.

191
00:14:56,577 --> 00:14:58,285
I paid off a large chunk of my debt.

192
00:15:01,283 --> 00:15:02,571
Kramer hooked me up.

193
00:15:04,064 --> 00:15:06,420
Really? Tell me more.

194
00:15:08,347 --> 00:15:09,665
I'd rather not.

195
00:15:11,037 --> 00:15:12,695
Well, now I'm really intrigued.

196
00:15:14,219 --> 00:15:17,341
Sandrine, come with me, we need to run an errand for Duncan.

197
00:15:17,341 --> 00:15:19,843
You stay here and keep an eye on Brian and the kids.

198
00:15:19,843 --> 00:15:21,506
Oh, you giving orders now, huh?

199
00:15:23,677 --> 00:15:25,124
I'm passing them along.

200
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,422
It's some type of poison. A patient ingested it.

201
00:15:33,422 --> 00:15:37,266
She presented with nausea, vomiting... I just need you to analyze it for me.

202
00:15:38,011 --> 00:15:40,051
- Sure, I'll get right on it. - Great.

203
00:15:54,545 --> 00:15:55,605
What's up, little man?

204
00:15:57,863 --> 00:16:00,828
I heard you met up with Kramer and his father yesterday.

205
00:16:00,828 --> 00:16:03,133
Uh, yeah.

206
00:16:03,133 --> 00:16:06,646
I just want to say I think you did the right thing.

207
00:16:06,646 --> 00:16:09,565
Kramer told me all about your conversation.

208
00:16:09,565 --> 00:16:12,471
I just did what they asked.

209
00:16:13,217 --> 00:16:14,178
I know.

210
00:16:18,494 --> 00:16:19,973
That's why I stopped by.

211
00:16:20,476 --> 00:16:24,921
- Say thanks. - Uh, yeah. No problem.

212
00:16:24,921 --> 00:16:26,831
But, look, just so I'm straight.

213
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,001
Tell me your version of the story.

214
00:16:47,338 --> 00:16:50,590
- What the hell you want? - Who the hell are you?

215
00:16:51,425 --> 00:16:53,144
I'm looking for a friend.

216
00:16:53,144 --> 00:16:55,403
- Your friend got a name? - Yeah.

217
00:16:55,403 --> 00:16:57,315
Herman. Goes by Hip.

218
00:16:57,883 --> 00:16:59,179
Found him.

219
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,506
I got a call that you'd be coming.

220
00:17:03,252 --> 00:17:05,550
- What's your name? - My name doesn't matter.

221
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:07,274
You ready to talk business?

222
00:17:10,217 --> 00:17:13,236
So, what's the deal with you and Archer?

223
00:17:14,806 --> 00:17:18,275
Did we ever sleep together? Yes. Long time ago.

224
00:17:19,611 --> 00:17:22,142
Are we sleeping together now? No.

225
00:17:30,024 --> 00:17:31,795
That's her. That's the target.

226
00:17:32,561 --> 00:17:33,501
Okay.

227
00:17:38,696 --> 00:17:41,022
- Agent Hoffman. - Stan, it's Duncan Carlisle.

228
00:17:41,022 --> 00:17:42,452
I just got a tip from an informant,

229
00:17:42,452 --> 00:17:45,041
says she's got some information about Angela Nix.

230
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:48,116
I'm gonna meet her in 30 minutes on the corner of Anacostia and Third.

231
00:17:48,116 --> 00:17:51,428
- A place called The New Dawn restaurant. - Okay, I'll meet you there.

232
00:17:55,372 --> 00:17:57,862
We're all set. He'll be here soon.

233
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,859
He'll be at the location in 25 minutes.

234
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:19,581
You'll move on my signal. Understand?

235
00:18:19,581 --> 00:18:20,786
It's all good.

236
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,696
Just make it look like a random shooting.

237
00:18:53,536 --> 00:18:56,751
Good. Let me know the second it's done.

238
00:19:20,883 --> 00:19:23,017
Your timing is impeccable.

239
00:19:23,017 --> 00:19:24,800
I just spoke to our friend.

240
00:19:25,325 --> 00:19:28,658
- Our problem's about to disappear. - Good.

241
00:19:38,596 --> 00:19:39,637
Well?

242
00:19:40,355 --> 00:19:42,540
That was our friend, the Chief of Staff.

243
00:19:43,091 --> 00:19:44,428
Things are in motion.

244
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:49,690
Are you sure this is absolutely necessary?

245
00:19:57,758 --> 00:20:00,428
The risk of not doing it outweighs the risk of doing it.

246
00:20:01,147 --> 00:20:04,692
So, yes. It's necessary.

247
00:20:14,741 --> 00:20:16,316
"We sleep safely at night because

248
00:20:16,316 --> 00:20:19,920
"rough men stand ready to visit violence against those who would harm us. "

249
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:24,711
Patton. Churchill.

250
00:20:28,158 --> 00:20:32,411
You know, you are going to make a great...

251
00:20:32,411 --> 00:20:34,425
President, one day.

252
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:01,067
Target is in position.

253
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:04,366
Game time.

254
00:21:04,366 --> 00:21:06,740
- Get ready. - Copy that, boss.

255
00:21:22,874 --> 00:21:25,062
- Agent Carlisle. - I just got here.

256
00:21:25,062 --> 00:21:27,733
I'm stuck in a little traffic, I'll be there in about five minutes.

257
00:21:27,733 --> 00:21:28,619
Okay.

258
00:21:47,193 --> 00:21:49,013
These guys know the target is a Fed?

259
00:21:50,752 --> 00:21:53,317
They don't know. They wouldn't care anyway.

260
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:55,699
You sure it won't come back to us?

261
00:21:55,699 --> 00:21:56,965
Positive.

262
00:21:57,533 --> 00:22:01,785
It'll look like what it is. Hoffman was in the wrong place at the wrong time.

263
00:22:01,785 --> 00:22:06,116
A victim of gang violence. His wife gets a pension.

264
00:22:34,238 --> 00:22:36,409
- What the hell is he doing? - What's with this guy?

265
00:22:38,424 --> 00:22:40,586
Call Hoffman. Keep him there.

266
00:22:45,412 --> 00:22:46,669
- Hello? - Stan.

267
00:22:46,669 --> 00:22:48,325
It's me. I'm pretty close.

268
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:52,689
Hey listen, no worries. I'm just enjoying the beautiful scenery here.

269
00:22:52,689 --> 00:22:56,018
- I bet. - By the way, this informant...

270
00:22:56,018 --> 00:22:58,628
- Is she credible? - Yeah, she's solid.

271
00:22:58,628 --> 00:23:01,526
Oh, there you are. I see you up ahead.

272
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:08,003
Yo! Move out the way!

273
00:23:10,941 --> 00:23:11,816
Incoming
Laura

274
00:23:14,324 --> 00:23:19,273
- Hey, sweetheart, I can't talk right now. - I'm sorry, sir, there's been a car accident.

275
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:21,780
This phone was found next to the victim.

276
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:26,366
- What? - You need to come to the emergency room at GW Medical Center right away.

277
00:23:33,924 --> 00:23:36,441
Yo! Move out of the way!

278
00:23:36,942 --> 00:23:40,119
Are you deaf? Move out of the way!

279
00:23:48,412 --> 00:23:50,055
Where the hell did he go?

280
00:23:50,055 --> 00:23:51,593
Find him. Now.

281
00:24:15,786 --> 00:24:17,497
No sign of him, man. He's gone.

282
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:18,556
Keep looking.

283
00:24:19,282 --> 00:24:20,632
What the hell happened? Where did he go?

284
00:24:20,632 --> 00:24:21,858
I don't know. Call him.

285
00:24:21,858 --> 00:24:24,189
Maybe he just went around the corner to take a leak or something.

286
00:24:24,189 --> 00:24:25,589
Maybe he's still close by.

287
00:24:27,996 --> 00:24:29,021
Hoffman.

288
00:24:31,545 --> 00:24:33,609
We missed our chance.
(From Hoffman:
Had to take off. Family emergency. Call you later.)

289
00:24:36,026 --> 00:24:37,100
Now what?

290
00:24:53,923 --> 00:24:56,571
Ah, Ellen, I was just about to come to your office.

291
00:24:56,571 --> 00:24:58,554
I thought I'd save you a trip.

292
00:24:58,554 --> 00:25:00,567
Did you get a chance to analyze that sample I gave you?

293
00:25:00,567 --> 00:25:02,442
I, I did.

294
00:25:02,442 --> 00:25:05,163
Tell me again. Where did you get this from?

295
00:25:06,337 --> 00:25:08,952
The patient's father brought it to me. He was concerned.

296
00:25:08,952 --> 00:25:12,674
- Thought it might be toxic. Why? - It's not poison.

297
00:25:12,674 --> 00:25:14,989
It's dimethyl sulfoxide.

298
00:25:14,989 --> 00:25:18,192
Dimethyl sulfoxide, isn't that a preservative?

299
00:25:18,192 --> 00:25:20,267
It's a bone marrow preservative.

300
00:25:20,267 --> 00:25:22,992
Mostly, it's for leukemia patients.

301
00:25:23,485 --> 00:25:27,753
You would need to ingest an awful lot of this to cause a reaction.

302
00:25:27,753 --> 00:25:30,195
Are you sure that this is what made your patient ill?

303
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,137
Uh, well, apparently not.

304
00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:35,302
Well, thank you. This information is very helpful.

305
00:25:42,078 --> 00:25:44,481
All right, gentlemen, let's get down to business.

306
00:25:44,481 --> 00:25:46,902
Where are we on the exit plan for OTI?

307
00:25:46,902 --> 00:25:49,821
If you are going to distance yourself from this program,

308
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:53,900
- you're gonna need a fall guy. - More than one.

309
00:25:54,643 --> 00:25:56,364
We'll need some time to get our ducks in a row, sir.

310
00:25:56,364 --> 00:25:59,032
This thing could blow up in our faces. The sooner, the better.

311
00:25:59,032 --> 00:26:01,095
Excuse me a moment, Mr. President.

312
00:26:07,311 --> 00:26:10,711
- I assume you're calling with good news? - You assume wrong.

313
00:26:11,405 --> 00:26:13,822
- What happened? - It doesn't matter, we didn't get it done.

314
00:26:16,081 --> 00:26:17,767
- What now? - Not sure.

315
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:20,308
I'll get back to you in a few hours.

316
00:26:31,368 --> 00:26:32,878
Sorry, Mr. President.

317
00:26:34,438 --> 00:26:35,542
My wife.

318
00:26:36,132 --> 00:26:39,668
Sometimes she forgets that you're the leader of the free world.

319
00:26:39,668 --> 00:26:42,035
That's all right. So does mine.

320
00:27:03,358 --> 00:27:05,870
- Where you been? - Running an errand for Duncan.

321
00:27:07,388 --> 00:27:08,598
What sort of errand?

322
00:27:09,512 --> 00:27:11,902
I guess if Duncan wanted you to know he'd have told you.

323
00:27:11,902 --> 00:27:13,467
I wasn't talking to you.

324
00:27:14,627 --> 00:27:17,057
We were making a delivery. No big deal.

325
00:27:17,057 --> 00:27:20,120
- Duncan didn't tell us what it was. - Relax, tough guy.

326
00:27:20,797 --> 00:27:24,980
- We're on the same team, remember? - Then why are you so worried about where we were?

327
00:27:26,194 --> 00:27:30,635
I just want to make sure my partners aren't out there doing anything stupid.

328
00:27:31,577 --> 00:27:33,200
Like killing a limo driver.

329
00:27:39,987 --> 00:27:42,870
- Why'd you drag him into this?-  I didn't.

330
00:27:53,407 --> 00:27:55,321
- Sorry to keep you waiting. -No.

331
00:27:55,321 --> 00:27:57,910
You remember Dr. Evans, my personal physician?

332
00:27:59,007 --> 00:28:01,252
I'm told you want to do more blood work today.

333
00:28:01,252 --> 00:28:04,955
Yes, I just want to make sure his blood clotting factors are back to normal.

334
00:28:04,955 --> 00:28:07,046
Well, let's get this over with.

335
00:28:07,046 --> 00:28:09,073
The surgery isn't for another six days.

336
00:28:09,614 --> 00:28:11,973
Why not wait? Test it closer to the date?

337
00:28:11,973 --> 00:28:15,305
Relax, Hank. Congress shoots arrows at me all day.

338
00:28:15,305 --> 00:28:17,807
I think I can handle a little needle in the arm.

339
00:28:18,689 --> 00:28:23,152
In light of what happened, I'll be at the President's side until the surgery's completed.

340
00:28:24,365 --> 00:28:27,280
Happy to have you. This won't take a minute.

341
00:28:38,262 --> 00:28:39,236
Mr. Creasy.

342
00:28:39,236 --> 00:28:42,457
Agent Hoffman's office called again. They want to schedule an interview.

343
00:28:42,457 --> 00:28:45,348
- Did he say what it was about? - Something to do with Dr. Sanders.

344
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,685
Schedule for tomorrow.

345
00:28:48,233 --> 00:28:50,491
Also, Colonel Blair is looking for you.

346
00:29:05,721 --> 00:29:08,698
- I'll help you. - Thank you, sir.

347
00:29:09,884 --> 00:29:10,982
I'll take these.

348
00:29:12,846 --> 00:29:15,036
I was going to take them to our lab at MCH.

349
00:29:15,036 --> 00:29:18,031
The President's blood is always analyzed at the Naval hospital.

350
00:29:19,289 --> 00:29:21,646
- Of course. - We'll send you the results.

351
00:29:22,353 --> 00:29:23,240
Thank you.

352
00:29:24,821 --> 00:29:26,502
I'll need the trash as well.

353
00:29:29,045 --> 00:29:31,611
All traces of the President's DNA are safeguarded.

354
00:29:31,611 --> 00:29:33,467
For national security reasons.

355
00:29:43,307 --> 00:29:47,579
- You going somewhere? - I was looking for you earlier.

356
00:29:47,579 --> 00:29:50,470
Really? Did you call?

357
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:54,897
Text? How exactly were you looking for me?

358
00:29:54,897 --> 00:29:57,060
- Well, uh... - So.

359
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,587
What happened with our problem?

360
00:29:59,512 --> 00:30:03,341
- It's under control.
- Does that mean it's been eliminated?

361
00:30:03,341 --> 00:30:06,440
Not yet. But it will be.

362
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,346
- So, it's not under control. - It will be.

363
00:30:09,346 --> 00:30:10,598
Soon.

364
00:30:11,126 --> 00:30:12,589
You have my word.

365
00:30:14,053 --> 00:30:15,085
Good.

366
00:30:16,328 --> 00:30:18,338
Then I guess we have nothing to worry about.

367
00:30:21,228 --> 00:30:23,628
You're going to the reception tonight, right?

368
00:30:24,516 --> 00:30:27,068
- Yes. - Good.

369
00:30:27,068 --> 00:30:28,549
Afterwards, I want you to come back to my house,

370
00:30:28,549 --> 00:30:32,231
- I'm having a few people over. - Sounds good.

371
00:31:19,365 --> 00:31:22,510
Three times in one day. You are getting to be a regular, Ellen.

372
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:25,880
Last request, I promise. Can I get a workup on this blood sample?

373
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,132
Is there enough in there?

374
00:31:29,081 --> 00:31:32,019
Hmm. I'll see what I can do.

375
00:31:32,019 --> 00:31:34,096
Great, well I'm going to take off for the night.

376
00:31:34,096 --> 00:31:38,729
- Would you mind emailing me the results? - Sure. I still have your email.

377
00:31:38,729 --> 00:31:41,044
Actually, the old one got hacked, long story.

378
00:31:41,044 --> 00:31:43,189
Could you just send it to this one?

379
00:31:45,243 --> 00:31:47,020
- Will do. - Thank you.

380
00:31:58,579 --> 00:32:01,049
- Everything okay with your family? - Oh, yeah, yeah.

381
00:32:01,049 --> 00:32:04,533
My wife's phone was stolen and it was found at the scene of an accident.

382
00:32:04,533 --> 00:32:06,542
- But she's fine. - Hmm.

383
00:32:06,542 --> 00:32:07,645
Glad to hear that.

384
00:32:08,364 --> 00:32:11,768
The informant we were supposed to meet in Southeast turned out to be full of crap.

385
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,312
Just an ex-girlfriend looking to settle a score.

386
00:32:16,388 --> 00:32:19,055
So, I guess we're back to square one.

387
00:32:21,875 --> 00:32:23,817
- I'll let you get that. - All right.

388
00:32:25,979 --> 00:32:26,884
Yes?

389
00:32:36,306 --> 00:32:37,659
Where do you want to meet?

390
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,401
I'm glad you came, Agent Hoffman.

391
00:33:16,478 --> 00:33:18,303
I have quite a story for you.

392
00:33:20,085 --> 00:33:21,332
Mr. Creasy.

393
00:33:22,592 --> 00:33:23,983
Quite the surprise.

394
00:33:33,414 --> 00:33:36,964
- Lift up your shirt. - Excuse me?

395
00:33:36,964 --> 00:33:39,287
This is 100% off the record.

396
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,613
I don't want any wires or recording devices.

397
00:33:51,444 --> 00:33:52,619
Pockets.

398
00:34:11,931 --> 00:34:14,204
The President's going to be assassinated.

399
00:34:16,256 --> 00:34:21,238
Everything is in place. The wheels are already in motion.

400
00:34:23,554 --> 00:34:24,512
How do you know?

401
00:34:26,216 --> 00:34:27,514
Because I'm involved.

402
00:34:29,612 --> 00:34:33,489
I can get you all the details. But I want a deal.

403
00:34:34,084 --> 00:34:36,053
You want a deal for committing treason?

404
00:34:36,053 --> 00:34:38,118
I'm saving the President's life.

405
00:34:38,809 --> 00:34:42,086
Without me, Paul Kincaid is a dead man.

406
00:34:43,238 --> 00:34:46,652
I want full immunity from Federal and State prosecution.

407
00:34:48,047 --> 00:34:50,020
And $5,000,000 cash.

408
00:34:50,641 --> 00:34:51,584
Cash?

409
00:34:53,914 --> 00:34:55,160
I'll need to disappear.

410
00:34:55,867 --> 00:34:58,627
I think the witness protection program will be a more viable...

411
00:34:58,627 --> 00:34:59,922
Not for me.

412
00:35:01,437 --> 00:35:05,847
The people behind this are extremely powerful.

413
00:35:06,796 --> 00:35:09,768
If I don't hear from you in five hours, I'll be on a plane.

414
00:35:10,466 --> 00:35:12,901
And you and your colleagues will be running around like Chihuahuas

415
00:35:12,901 --> 00:35:16,123
trying to figure out who just killed the President of the United States.

416
00:35:16,123 --> 00:35:18,266
- Let me talk to a Federal prosecutor... - No.

417
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:21,722
Go straight to the Attorney General.

418
00:35:22,233 --> 00:35:26,448
He's the only one who can make this deal. And he's the only one I trust.

419
00:35:46,596 --> 00:35:48,514
- xxx great. - Good evening.

420
00:35:51,376 --> 00:35:52,783
Good to see you, Quentin.

421
00:35:53,563 --> 00:35:54,459
Colonel.

422
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,851
You missed the Dutch Ambassador's opening remarks.

423
00:35:58,664 --> 00:35:59,750
Shame.

424
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:01,614
Well, why do you think I came late?

425
00:36:03,417 --> 00:36:05,153
You shouldn't look so serious, Quentin.

426
00:36:05,835 --> 00:36:07,526
Everything's going to be fine.

427
00:36:07,526 --> 00:36:10,425
- Oh, I'm not worried. - Good.

428
00:36:11,005 --> 00:36:12,721
Drink up. Enjoy.

429
00:36:13,567 --> 00:36:14,941
See you later tonight.

430
00:36:17,622 --> 00:36:21,058
So, you got this guy Kramer wrapped around your finger.

431
00:36:21,689 --> 00:36:23,661
He's a good guy, relax.

432
00:36:23,661 --> 00:36:26,312
You think it's really smart getting involved with him?

433
00:36:26,312 --> 00:36:27,358
Right now?

434
00:36:28,447 --> 00:36:30,869
Smart? No.

435
00:36:30,869 --> 00:36:32,918
But since when is that the criteria?

436
00:36:35,044 --> 00:36:37,283
Well, you're a big girl. You can do what you want.

437
00:36:37,283 --> 00:36:41,249
- As long as I'm not on the wrong end of it. - What are you talking about?

438
00:36:41,249 --> 00:36:44,154
In spite of what your boyfriend says, this limo driver thing...

439
00:36:44,154 --> 00:36:46,980
- It isn't over. - Not your problem.

440
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:50,632
Sure it is. 'Cause if they go for him, or you,

441
00:36:50,632 --> 00:36:52,888
that puts all of us at risk.

442
00:36:52,888 --> 00:36:54,668
Just like the missing nurse.

443
00:36:54,668 --> 00:36:58,042
Difference is, I know how to keep my mouth shut.

444
00:37:01,371 --> 00:37:03,298
Are you saying you don't trust me?

445
00:37:05,095 --> 00:37:07,456
When it comes to cutting a deal on a murder rap,

446
00:37:08,106 --> 00:37:09,552
I don't trust my own mother.

447
00:37:10,789 --> 00:37:12,296
And I love that lady to death.

448
00:37:25,505 --> 00:37:26,532
No, thank you.

449
00:37:32,482 --> 00:37:37,199
I always love these cocktail receptions, all the scintillating chit chat and the rumors.

450
00:37:38,038 --> 00:37:39,246
You know me.

451
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:43,449
The more vapid the conversation, the more I enjoy it.

452
00:37:43,449 --> 00:37:45,372
Don't go. Not yet.

453
00:37:45,796 --> 00:37:47,546
There's something I want to say to you.

454
00:37:48,841 --> 00:37:51,020
- Pardon me? - I've always liked you.

455
00:37:52,021 --> 00:37:54,039
Despite our issues.

456
00:37:55,086 --> 00:37:58,066
Thank you. I appreciate that.

457
00:37:58,819 --> 00:38:01,152
You read the Bible, Quentin?

458
00:38:03,118 --> 00:38:04,614
You know, Moses.

459
00:38:05,272 --> 00:38:07,681
He led his people all the way to the promised land,

460
00:38:07,681 --> 00:38:10,697
but he never set foot in it.

461
00:38:11,699 --> 00:38:15,208
Sorry. I'm not a religious man.

462
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:17,787
We will succeed.

463
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:20,535
In the end.

464
00:38:29,342 --> 00:38:30,884
Like I said, Quentin.

465
00:38:32,029 --> 00:38:33,120
I'm sorry.

466
00:39:06,292 --> 00:39:08,824
Is he okay? What happened?

467
00:39:12,264 --> 00:39:14,529
Quentin, are you all right? He's not breathing!

468
00:39:14,529 --> 00:39:15,769
Call a doctor.

469
00:39:24,463 --> 00:39:25,843
There's been an accident.

470
00:39:27,071 --> 00:39:29,503
The Chief of Staff has suffered a heart attack.

471
00:39:30,251 --> 00:39:31,403
I'm sorry to hear that.

472
00:39:35,449 --> 00:39:36,804
You wanted to see me?

473
00:39:36,804 --> 00:39:41,481
Yeah. I need you to drive me to the Attorney General's office right away.

474
00:39:41,481 --> 00:39:44,760
What's this all about? I need to deliver these files in person.

475
00:39:45,477 --> 00:39:47,775
I also need somebody to watch my back.

476
00:39:50,285 --> 00:39:52,611
- I'll explain more on the way. - Fair enough.

477
00:40:05,423 --> 00:40:08,100
- Why are we stopping? - I think we have a flat tire.

478
00:40:32,915 --> 00:40:33,891

00:42:00,609 --> 00:42:02,639
I ran a test on the President's blood.

484
00:42:05,745 --> 00:42:08,528
He and your wife both share the same,

485
00:42:10,002 --> 00:42:11,186
very rare,

486
00:42:12,232 --> 00:42:13,313
blood type.

487
00:42:14,726 --> 00:42:17,307
His bone marrow is the perfect match for her.

488
00:42:19,077 --> 00:42:20,297
I'm aware of that.

489
00:42:23,695 --> 00:42:26,713
She's the President's daughter, isn't she?

490
00:42:30,135 --> 00:42:31,067
Yes.

491
00:42:33,714 --> 00:42:36,257
Why don't you just ask him for the bone marrow,

492
00:42:36,257 --> 00:42:39,956
- why do you have to kill him? - Because he doesn't know she's alive.

493
00:42:41,731 --> 00:42:42,756
If he did...

494
00:42:44,737 --> 00:42:45,959
he'd kill her.

00:42:51,499 --> 00:42:55,042
