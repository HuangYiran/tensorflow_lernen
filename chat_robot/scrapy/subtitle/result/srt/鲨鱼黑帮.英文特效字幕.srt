234
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:15,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oscar why do you get yourself into these situations?

235

00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,760

238

00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:45,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The top of the reef. Where the somebodies live.

243
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:51,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l wanna be rich and famous like them but l'm stuck down here.

246
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:01,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember my dad? He worked at the Wash his whole life.

247
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:05,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ooh child...

248
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:08,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was the number one tongue scrubber.

249
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Every year for 25 years.

250
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:19,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To me working at the Wash was the coolest job in the ocean.

251
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:24,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But then I learned something I will never forget.

252
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:26,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oscar's dad's a tongue scrubber!

253
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tongue scrubber! Tongue scrubber!

254
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:33,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tongue scrubber! Tongue scrubber! Tongue scrubber! Tongue scrubber!

255
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:37,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My dad was the greatest.

256
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:40,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But nobody loves a nobody.

257
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l want to be a somebody.

258
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:50,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oscar  you don't have to live at the top of the reef to be a somebody.

259
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:56,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's the difference? lf l don't pay Mr. Sykes back by tomorrow...

260
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l'm dead anyway so...

261
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait here.

262
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:16,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's this?

263
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:21,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A pink pearl?  Mmhm.

264
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where'd you get that?

265
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:25,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My grandmother gave it to me.

266
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:31,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She said it started from a tiny grain of sand

267
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:36,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but then after a while it grew into something beautiful.

268
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dreams can begin small too.

269
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. No l couldn't...  Take it.

270
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}lt'll get you the money you need for Mr. Sykes.

271
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:56,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you mean you don't understand? We've been over it 1 000 times.

272
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l don't want to have to say it again.

273
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're really giving me agita. l don't know how else to say this.

274
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see something you kill it you eat it. Period. Thanks.

275
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:08,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what sharks do. That's a fine tradition.

276
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:12,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's the matter with you? Your brother Frankie here he's a killer.

277
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks Pop.  He's beautiful.

278
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He does what he's supposed to do. Wipe your face.

279
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:21,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you... l'm hearin' things.

280
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:26,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You gotta understand when you look weak it makes me look weak.

281
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l can't have that.  l know Pop l'm sorry.

282
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:32,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lenny. Lenny. Look at me. Look at me.

283
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:35,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This handin' over the business it's for you for both of yous

284
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you're acting like you don't even want it.

285
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:42,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l need to know that you can handle that.

286
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. Right here in front of me now eat this.

287

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Gee thanks Pop.

288
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here's the thing.

289
00:18:55,820 --> 00:19:00,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l'm on a diet. l read an article about these shrimps. They're not good for ya.

290
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know how many calories are in one of those shrimps?

291
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:05,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A lot.

292
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}lt's true. lt's true and the other thing is

293
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:12,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}my sister had a baby and l took it over because she passed away

294
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and then the baby lost its legs and its arms

295
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:19,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and now it's nothing but a stump but l still take care of it with my wife

296
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:23,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and it's growing and it's fairly happy

297
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:29,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but it's difficult 'cause l've been working a second shift at the factory to put food on the table

298
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:34,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but all the love l see in that little guy's face makes it worth it in the end.

299
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}True story.

00:53:19,010 --> 00:53:23,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you're gonna say ''Stop. Don't y'all. Don't go no farther!''

887
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,380
