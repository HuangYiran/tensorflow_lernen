洪福飯店  我的最愛
Ah, Hop Foo's, my favorite.

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,910
來個早午餐也不錯
Don't mind if I brunch.

00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,890
你連早餐都吃外賣嗎
Are you eating takeout for breakfast?

6
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,440
你現在可是我女朋友了
Hey, you're my girlfriend now.

8
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:22,610
你不應該對我的行為有異議
You're not supposed to judge anything I do.

9
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:23,790
你再說一遍
Say that again.

10
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,220
你現在是我女朋友了
You're my girlfriend now.

12
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,330
我喜歡
I like it.

13
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,650
盡管你嘴里還有個餃子
Even when you have dumpling in your mouth.

14
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,180
但我還是喜歡
Sounds good.

15
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:32,510
我得走了  我今天
I have to go. I have a big meeting

16
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:34,540
-跟福斯特校長有個會  -我討厭那人
- with Principal Foster today. - I hate that guy.

17
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,390
-他總是否定你的想法  -不不不
- He always says no to your ideas. - No, no, no.

18
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,660
這次不會了  這次是
Not this one. This one is, uh,

19
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,540
保護海洋日的活動
Ocean Conservation Day.

20
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,080
杰茜  你為什么這么對自己呢
Why do you do this to yourself, Jess?

21
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,470
你是在勸我不去爭取直接放棄嗎
So you're telling me to not even try?

22
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:44,320
我只是不想讓你去碰了壁
I just don't want you to be

23
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,920
再感到失望
disappointed when he says no.

24
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,500
或許你應該努力去
Look, maybe you should try

25
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:49,110
別那么努力
to try a little less.

26
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,010
我該怎么努力去不努力呢
How am I supposed to try to not try?

27
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,470
是個矛盾
That's a catch-22.

28
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:54,390
教練
Oh, hey, Coach.

29
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,010
我掉了個餃子
Oh, I dropped a dumpling!

30
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,000
-那是他的早餐嗎  -是的
- That is his breakfast? - Yeah.

31
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,370
多可愛啊
Isn't it cute?

32
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,720
他一點都不覺得羞愧
He's not even ashamed of it. Oh.

33
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,740
拿住了
I got it!

34
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,430
差點就跑掉了
It almost got away from me... Aah!

35
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:08,950
杰茜駕到 第三季 第八集

36
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,060
福斯特校長  這是我們
Look, Principal Foster, we have the chance

37
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,530
大放異彩的一次機會
to do something really great.

38
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,150
所有的經費都是捐贈來的
Everything's been donated.

39
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,160
我們只需要準備車費就行了
All we need are transportation costs.

40
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,660
得了吧
Come on!

41
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,150
車旅費是做任何事情
That's only the most expensive

42
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,660
最昂貴的經費了
part of doing anything!

43
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,650
你真是  對不起
You... I'm sorry.

44
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:23,730
我太魯莽了
That was rude.

45
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,010
我昨晚沒睡好
I slept very badly last night.

46
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:29,590
大半夜喝了杯印度拉茶
Had a chai tea very late.

47
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,210
有朋友從蒙特利爾來看我
Had friends in from Montreal.

48
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,540
有的孩子一直住在洛杉磯
Some of these kids have lived in L.A. their entire lives

49
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,600
卻從來沒去看過大海
and they've never even seen the ocean.

50
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,270
上個星期我讓他們
Last week I asked them to draw

51
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:39,030
把他們想象中的海洋畫出來
what they thought the ocean looked like.

52
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,790
他們畫了一堆這些東西
I got a lot of stuff like this.

53
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,290
那是個長了翅膀的面包圈么
Is that a bagel with wings?

54
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,260
-是的  -屌爆了
- Yes, sir, it is. - Extraordinary.

55
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,050
我可不能接受您不同意這次活動的提議
I'm afraid I'm not taking no for an answer.

56
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,480
你還真就得碰壁了
You're gonna have to take no for an answer

57
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,120
這事沒得商量
because that's just the way it is.

58
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,800
長了腿的鯊魚
Hmm, a shark with legs.

59
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:55,740
一點都不合邏輯
That's not even anatomically close to correct.

60
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:59,040
這就是個方塊啊
That's just a square, though.

61
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,700
讓他們重新畫吧
Have them start over.

62
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,000
太糟糕了
That's just terrible.

63
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:06,480
尼克
Nick?

64
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,000
我想跟你談談你的健康狀況
I want to talk to you about your fitness level.

65
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,090
-談什么  我的身體  -你上一次鍛煉身體是什么時候
- Of what? My body? - When's the last time you worked out?

66
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:11,820
我來告訴你
You know what? I'll tell you

67
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,070
他上一次鍛煉身體是什么時候吧
when the last time he worked out was.

68
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,840
是他在跟他爹的其他精子
It was the time that he battled his daddy's other dumb sperm

69
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,010
爭奪誰先到達他娘的卵子的時候
in order to make his way to his mama's dumb-ass egg.

70
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,490
你的幽默感有所提高啊親
Your burns are getting better, man.

71
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,440
-廢話太多  -好吧
- Just really long. - Okay.

72
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:23,780
我不需要鍛煉身體
Look, I don't need to work out.

73
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,410
我是個經典康尼島的壯漢
I'm old-fashioned, Coney Island fat-strong.

74
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:29,100
尼可拉斯  早餐就吃中餐啊
Ah, Nicholas. Chinese food for breakfast.

75
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,200
真是健康啊
See you're still a health nut.

76
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,240
你不是應該在工作么
Aren't you supposed to be at work?

77
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,090
我請假了
I'm rocking a PD-- personal day.

78
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,480
最后一天搬家
Yeah, last day of the move.

79
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,120
教練  看來你真是抓緊一切時間搬到我原來的房間啊
Coach, I see you've wasted no time moving into my old room.

80
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,770
我就是過來
Anyway, I just came over to, uh,

81
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,860
還鑰匙的
drop off my old key.

82
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,860
這是個歷史時刻嘍
Wow, so this is like a moment.

83
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,310
想最后再來看看這個地方
Looking to get some much-needed space from this place.

84
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,950
-你不就是搬到對門嘛  -也是
- You're right across the hall. - That's true.

85
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,540
無論你身在何方
Everywhere you go...

86
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,210
我們與你同在
there you are.

87
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,650
-什么  -說啥呢
- What? - What?

88
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:56,340
他的牛仔褲好緊啊
His jeans are so small.

89
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,670
他看上去像個小木偶
He looks like a little puppet.

90
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,540
還是個意大利手工制作
Like something some Italian whittled.

91
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,000
你就讓我訓練訓練你吧
Come on, man, just let me train you.

92
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,100
尼克  我覺得你是該鍛煉了
You know what, Nick? You should do it.

93
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,220
我倒希望教練也能訓練訓練我
I would love for Coach to train me,

94
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,810
但我昨天打球有點
but I kind of pushed it too hard

95
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,160
打得太猛了
at the court yesterday.

96
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,450
扣了個籃
Went in for a dunk.

97
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:08,770
結果落地把腳崴了
Landed sort of funny.

98
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,320
典型的溫斯頓
Typical Winston.

99
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,110
-沒錯  -你什么意思
- That's true. - What is that supposed to mean?

100
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,910
你總是脆弱異常
Because you're always too injured to play.

101
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,120
記得上次你因為心情不好就不打比賽了嗎
Remember when you sat out of the game because you were sad?

102
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,510
我那時還很冷
I was also cold.

103
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:23,660
尼克  我們就這么做
Nick. Let's do this.

104
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:25,920
看著我
Look at me.

105
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,340
你現在又談戀愛了
Now, you're in a new relationship,

106
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,480
想做回十五歲青少年不是那么容易的
which puts you at risk for gaining the boyfriend 15.

107
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,000
-這都不叫事兒  -這就是事兒
- That's not a thing. - It is a thing.

108
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,150
杰茜就喜歡我這樣的
Jess is into this.

109
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,790
我見過的例子數不勝數
I've seen this happen a million times.

110
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:38,590
十五歲的青春少年很快就成了二十歲的糙漢子
The boyfriend 15 quickly turns into the boyfriend 20.

111
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,510
接下來  你就成了個大胖子
Next thing you know, you're a fat dude on a little bike

112
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,220
戴著牛仔帽  騎著自行車  喊著”我屁股痛”
with a cowboy hat on talking about, "My ass hurts."

113
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,630
-我可不想變成那樣  -我也不想你變成那樣
- I don't want to be that. - I don't want you to be that.

114
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,910
我是會騎著車繞圈子
I would just be riding around in circles

115
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,110
-還是確實要去某個地方  -繞圈  伙計
- or would I be going places? - Circles, dude.

116
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,400
你就等著變成肥豬手吧
Fat-guy rash on your arm.

117
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,950
好吧  施密特想把我弄去鍛煉不是一天兩天了
Okay, look, Schmidt's tried to get me to work out for years.

118
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:54,850
他都沒成功
It didn't take.

119
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,670
而且  我背痛可嚴重了
Also, and it's not an excuse,

120
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,760
這可不是借口
I have a very bad back.

121
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:58,700
-你背痛嗎  -是啊
- Your bad back? - Yeah.

122
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,840
兩天前你一路上都背著我
You gave me a piggyback ride

123
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:01,920
還有說有笑的
two days ago and you giggled the whole time.

124
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:02,920
可棒了
It was awesome.

125
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,500
-還很有意思  -可有意思了
- It was also really funny. - That was pretty funny.

126
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,780
-我們還上了樓梯  伙計  -是啊
- We took the stairs, dude. - Yeah.

127
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,460
-那是因為我很興奮  -尼克
- It's 'cause I was excited. - Nick.

128
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,070
你要么吃了這個餃子做個大胖餃
Either take this dumpling and be a dumpling guy,

129
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:13,200
要么跟我鍛煉做個大壯男
or you train with me, and be a do-ing guy.

130
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,840
這可不容易  我這輩子都還是個大胖餃
It's hard because I've been a dumpling guy my whole life...

131
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,640
我知道
I know.

132
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,990
我只要你一天時間
One day, that's all I need.

133
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,570
然后改變你一生
And I will change your life.

134
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,530
你會看到自己的實力
You'll be able to see your abs.

135
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,780
我以為我生來無能
I thought God just didn't give me those.

136
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:26,560
來吧
Come on.

137
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:27,900
就這么做
Let's do it.

138
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,880
-好兄弟  -我加入
- My man! - I’m in!

139
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,090
我可得先警告你
I'm gonna warn you.

140
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,420
我可不是鍛煉的料
Working out is not my thing.

141
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,550
別擔心  兄弟  我從不失敗
Not worried, man. I do not fail.

142
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,940
我也加入
You know what? I'm in, too.

143
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,690
你受傷了  你不能去
You're injured, you shouldn't, you shouldn't do it.

144
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,540
什么  得了吧
What? Come on, Winny the Bish

145
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,100
貝小溫可不怕這點痛  寶貝兒
play through the pain, baby. You know what?

146
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,820
我們先來點開合跳熱熱身
Let's warm up with some jumping jacks.

147
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,280
我本來想...
I was going... Oh!

148
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,900
戴老師
Miss Day!

149
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,860
看看我這酷炫的沙灘帽
Check out my cool beach hat.

150
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58,250
不幸的是  我有個壞消息
Unfortunately, um, I have some bad news.

151
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,810
我們不會去野外考察了
Uh, we're not gonna get to go on that field trip.

152
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:05,330
但是你說過一切皆有可能  戴老師
But you said anything is possible, Miss Day.

153
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,920
你就一直穿著那頂帽子吧  克里斯多
You just keep wearing that hat, Crystal.

154
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,220
因為只要熱狗能做帽子
Because as long as hot dogs are hats...

155
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,700
一切皆有可能
Anything is possible.

156
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:19,780
你可以是宇宙里第一個小女孩
You could be the first little girl in space.

157
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:23,530
騎著熱狗帽一路飛向月亮吧  姑娘
You just ride that hot dog hat all the way to the moon, girl.

158
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:28,100
克里斯多  你不準碰我
Oh, Crystal, you're not legally allowed to touch me.

159
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:29,910
但是謝謝你
But thank you.

160
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:38,910
猜猜看誰又有了教練
Hey, guess who got a trainer.

161
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,070
這么多菜單
So many menus.

162
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,310
我會跟貝瑞·邦茲[美國棒球運動員]一樣健壯
I'm gonna look like Barry Bonds.

163
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,420
搞什么
Seriously, what the hell?

164
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,710
我知道了  跟福斯特談得不怎么樣
I take it, it didn't go well with Foster.

165
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,110
-確實不怎么樣  -杰茜
- It did not go well. - Aw, Jess.

166
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,670
我不想看你這么受傷
I hate seeing you hurt like this.

167
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:51,670
你搞什么  更多的菜單
Are you serious? More menus?

168
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,180
這簡直
This is like...

169
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,730
我們干嘛要更多菜單
Why do we need more menus?

170
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,790
我們的菜單還不夠嗎
Don't we have enough menus?

171
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,400
感覺你說了好多個菜單
Feels like you're saying menus a lot.

172
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,380
這簡直是環保災難
This is an eco-disaster.

173
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,810
保守黨就該勝選
Conservation deserves a win today.

174
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,820
洪福飯店已經砍掉最后一顆樹了
Hop Foo's has killed its last tree.

175
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:04,710
杰茜  你現在散發著
Jess, this feels like

176
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,520
發生了什么事的氣場
a something-else-is-going-on type of thing.

177
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,680
你還能開車嗎  你眼睛都綠了
Are you okay to drive? You got crazy eye!

178
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,960
歡迎光臨洪福飯店  有什么能幫您的嗎
Uh, welcome to Hop Foo's. Can I help you?

179
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,610
今天早上  我公寓出現了九張你們的菜單
This morning, there were nine menus just in my apartment.

180
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:21,640
我也恨那些菜單  太不環保了
I also hate those menus, they're so bad for the environment.

181
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,960
這很浪費的
It's wasteful.

182
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,240
簡直是環保災難
It's an eco-disaster.

183
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,300
我會跟老板說說  看我們能不能改改
I'll talk to my boss, see if we can change that.

184
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,950
很好  你就那么做
Yeah, great, you do that.

185
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,540
我會追蹤你們怎么處理的
I'm gonna follow up with you on that.

186
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,060
我們堆肥  回收  但是
I compost, recycle, but it's...

187
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,160
我覺得還不夠
I don't feel like it's enough.

188
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,050
謝謝你  太謝謝你了
Thank you. Geez, thank you so much

189
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,840
能夠站出來  說出來
for stepping up and saying something.

190
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,910
我就是這樣  我
That's who I am, that's just, you know, I'm...

191
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:42,490
-我叫布萊恩  -杰茜  杰茜卡  杰茜
- My name's Brian. - Jess. Jessica. Jess.

192
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,840
能碰到真正在乎環保人感覺太好了
It's really refreshing to meet someone who actually cares.

193
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,020
也要歸功于你的魅力
Well, it helps that you're gorgeous.

194
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,400
不可能
No, that's crazy.

195
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,820
你逗我呢
That ain't real.

196
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,370
無語了
That's dumb.

197
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:58,170
真的無語了  你蠢死了
That's straight dumb. You're dumb.

198
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,280
你可好了
You're nice.

199
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,840
假期愉快嗎
You excited for the holidays?

200
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,220
我很愉快
I am.

201
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,210
好了
Anyway...

202
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:06,380
我這個方法本身設計得就很簡單
My system is built to be easy. Okay.

203
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,590
像花生一樣簡單
It's easy as peanuts.

204
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,070
-像花生一樣簡單  -是的
- Easy as peanuts? - Yeah.

205
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,630
沒有這種表達  沒有人這樣說
That's not an expression; no one says that.

206
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,230
"花生"是個縮略詞  "花生"表示
PEANUTS is an acronym. PEANUTS stands for:

207
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:15,580
瘋狂體育鍛煉活動
Physical Education Activity Nuts!

208
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,060
就是  嗨起來  好好玩這樣
Like, like go nuts, have fun!

209
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,310
是  但你得用到每個單詞的首字母啊
Yeah, but you got to use every letter.

210
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,130
我知道  但是這樣也可以
I'm aware of that, but it still works.

211
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,220
進展如何  伙計
What's going on, guys?

212
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,110
我們開始吧
Let's do this.

213
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,740
告訴你喲  沒有什么傷痛
I tell you, ain't no injury gonna hold

214
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,120
能阻礙貝小溫  因為我是個戰士
old Winnie the Bish down 'cause I'm a warrior.

215
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,330
尼克懂的
Nick knows.

216
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:31,600
做波比嗎[一種高強度無氧運動]
Burpee?

217
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,830
好的  沒關系
All right, cool.

218
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,340
你的傷會變嚴重的
Injury is gonna get worse.

219
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,540
我不是個半途而廢的人
I'm not a quitter!

220
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,600
施密特  怎么了  兄弟
Hey, Schmidt, what's going on, man?

221
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,280
一切都好嗎
Everything okay?

222
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,650
我奧克蘭突擊者隊的小帽子是不是落那邊了
Did I leave my Oakland Raiders yarmulke over there?

223
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:43,650
不知道  我和教練在鍛煉
Don't know. Coach and I are working out.

224
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,140
這么多年  我一直想讓你鍛煉
I've been trying to get you to work out for years.

225
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,730
過來吧  伙計
Well, just come over, man.

226
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,010
我很享受我自己的地盤
I'm enjoying my space.

227
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,160
也許你可以按一下擴音鍵
But maybe you should just put me on speaker.

228
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:53,960
好了  說吧
Okay, you're on.

229
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,670
好  介紹一下現在的情形吧
Okay, cool, set the scene.

230
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:56,690
那邊現在是什么狀況
What's the vibe over there?

231
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:57,680
尼克還穿著牛仔褲呢
Nick's in jeans.

232
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,990
尼克松牛仔褲
Nixon jeans?

233
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,650
尼克松牛仔褲是個什么鬼東西
What the hell are Nixon jeans?

234
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,320
不過聽起來很不錯的樣子
They sound really cool.

235
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,930
我把那個菜單的事情解決了
Hey, I solved the menu thing.

236
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,860
我直接沖過去然后采取了行動
I just went down there, I took action.

237
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:08,910
厲害吧
Boom-yah.

238
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:09,710
我做出改變了喲
I made a change.

239
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,360
因為我做到了  我真的覺得
Now that I can do that, I really feel

240
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,020
我能搞定這個野外考察的事情
like I can figure out this field trip thing.

241
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,590
更厲害了吧
Double boom.

242
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,590
我們還有一些事情沒解決
There are still some things we need to figure out.

243
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:23,000
得讓他們明白我們的想法
Just got to get the message across.

244
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,620
你不用再給我們發這個了
Hey, hey, you don't, you don't need to leave these anymore.

245
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,260
你要跑去哪兒
Where are you running to?

246
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,570
誰派你來的
Who sent you?

247
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:37,750
布萊恩  我還以為你要和你老板談談呢
Brian, I thought you were gonna talk to your boss.

248
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,820
我就是老板啊
I am the boss.

249
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,390
洪福飯店是你開的嗎
Hop Foo's is your restaurant?

250
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,520
抱歉我撒了謊
Sorry I lied.

251
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,460
你看起來有點抓狂  我不想和你打交道
You just seemed kind of crazy, so I didn't want to deal.

252
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,180
但是你很喜歡交流啊
But you care about conservation.

253
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,270
我不喜歡  真的一點也不
Oh, I don't, I really don't.

254
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,670
我只關心我的飯店
I care about my restaurant.

255
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,820
見鬼吧你  布萊恩
You're going down, Brian!

256
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,690
我要收集大家的簽名
I'm gonna collect signatures,

257
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,070
我還會寫一封請愿書
I'm gonna start a petition,

258
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:58,040
然后把它交給飯店的
and I will turn it in to the person

259
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:01,370
負責人
who's in charge of restaurants.

260
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,030
我會讓這整個城市都知道你
And I'm gonna report you to the city!

261
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,680
不  不要整個城市
Oh, no, not the city.

262
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,200
不
No!

263
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,960
你這個混蛋  布萊恩
You're a jerk, Brian!

264
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:09,370
我要把你的飯店燒成灰
I'm gonna burn down your building!

265
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:11,180
我不會那樣做的  我不會那樣做的
I won't do that, I won't do that.

266
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,490
為什么人們會這樣混蛋
Why do people suck?!

267
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,980
我們會先用一些音樂熱身
Okay, we're gonna warm up with music.

268
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,470
感覺到了嗎
Yeah, feeling that?

269
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:24,550
我猜是的
I guess so.

270
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,780
放松肩部
Yeah, got to loosen up the shoulders.

271
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,660
擺動雙臂
Wiggle those arms.

272
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,630
-手臂  不是臉  -抱歉
- Arms, not your face. - Oh, sorry,

273
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,190
我以為你說的是臉
thought you said "Face."

274
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,020
真性感  鍛煉很性感

275
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:39,750
這一點都不性感  兄弟
That's not sexy, man.

276

-謝天謝地你來了  希希  -什么急事
- Ah, thank God you're here, Cece. - What's the emergency?

290
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,000
為什么杰茜需要這些中國菜
Why does Jess need all this Chinese food?

291
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,780
不  都是我編出來的
No, no, no, I just made all that up.

292
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:31,020
等等  你騙我給你買東西吃
Wait, you tricked me into getting you food?

293
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,610
是的
Yes.

294
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,480
為什么
Why?

295
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,470
-尼克  這是啥  -等下再說  別擔心
- Nick, what is this? - For after-- don't worry about it.

296
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,010
我馬上就回來
I will be right back.

297
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,090

299
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,850
就是這樣  就是這樣
That's what's up, that's what's up.

300
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,120
毫無疑問
No doubt.

301
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,500
不能猶豫
Diggity.

302
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,110
尼克
Nick!

303
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,660
胸脯  尼克
Breasts-- Ni...

304
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,160
這是飯錢  零頭
This is for the food, and there's a little extra

305
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,110
歸你
for you.

306
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,710
老天  你要給我小費嗎
Oh, my god, are you tipping me?

307
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:06,670
沒錯
Yeah.

308
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,920
如果我以后經濟危機了  再還我
Well, if I'm gonna get in trouble, give it back.

309
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,030
我給了你四美元
I gave you four bucks.

310
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:12,870
我會給你很多小費  我現在就給你
I'll tip you good... I'll tip you right over.

311
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:13,910

00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,340
是啊  是啊
Yeah, yeah.

313
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,800
可惡  我真希望我能說點別的
Damn, I wish I could have said something else.

314
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,610
-"現在就給你"就挺好  -好吧  她單身嗎
- "Tip you right over" was good. - Oh, okay, cool. Uh, is she single?

-是的  差不多吧  -太棒了伙計

317
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:26,360

我就吃一點
I'm just gonna eat a little.

319
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,170
這可不行  伙計
That's not how it works, dude.

320
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:29,340
我們還在鍛煉中呢
We're still in the middle of our workout.

321
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,960
-還沒完嗎  -沒有
- We're not done yet? - No!

322
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,750
我剛才和餐館老板
I just had a very productive conversation

323
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,040
進行了一次富有建設性的談話
with the owner of the restaurant.

324
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,230
行動已被采納  改變即將發生
Action has been taken, change is in the air.

325
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:41,170
現在我要去我房間研究官司來找點樂趣了
Now I'm going to go research lawsuits in my room for fun.

326
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,090
你還好嗎
You okay?

327
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:44,710
-你看起來有心事  -別再去那個地方訂餐了
- You seem a little off. - Stop ordering from that place.

328
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,270
尼克  把餃子放下
Nick, put the dumpling down.

329
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,090
杰森·斯特里特  《勝利之光》中黑豹隊四分衛

330
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,090
感覺如何  杰森·斯特里特
Hey, what's up, Jason Street?

331
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:52,950
網上說我不該下地走路
The Internet said that I had to stay off my feet,

332
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,960
但之后我就發現了這把輪椅
but then I found this wheelchair in a ditch,

333
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,660
我準備好開始鍛煉了
so I'm ready to work out.

334
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:00,270
溫斯頓  去躺下  尼克  把餃子放下
Winston, go lay down. Nick, put the dumpling down.

335
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,440
放松
Relax.

336
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,570
你剛才喘粗氣了嗎
Did you just gasp?

337
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,010
-我要吃一個  -沒門
- I'm having one... - Down.

338
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,920
我再來一遍  別
I'm gonna ask you again. Don't...

339
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,190
別那么做
Don't do it.

340
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,190
別
Don't. D...

341
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,650
我要吃一口這個
I'm going to eat one bite of this.

342
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,850
別吃  你能做的更好
Don't do it. You're better than this.

343
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,300
我不知道  我也許
I don't know if I am. I might..

344
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,710
不  別  別
No. Don't, don't.

345
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:26,940
別再那么搖了
Stop shaking it like that.

346
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,710
-讓我把餃子吃了  -發生什么了
- Let me eat the dumpling! - What's going on?

347
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:29,640
剛剛鍛煉完
Oh, just working out.

348
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,710
是的  在休息而已
Yeah. Just chilling.

349
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,000
這個里面放味精了嗎
Does this food have MSG in it?

350
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,580
什么
What?

351
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,420
我的老天爺  味精會把我的下巴定住
Oh, my God, MSG makes my jaw lock up.

352
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,400
你沒事吧  伙計
You all right, dude?

353
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,590
什么
What? Mm-hmm.

354
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,470
-你的下巴怎么了  -是啊怎么了
- What's going on with your jaw? - Yeah, dude.

355
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,130
你個混蛋
Come on, you son of a...

356
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,240
等等
Wait a minute.

357
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,320
這里寫了"不含味精"
Ha, "No MSG."

358
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,010
你要去哪
Where are you going?

359
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:50,130
-我要帶溫斯頓一起出去溜溜  -你要帶我去哪
- I'm just taking Winston for a walk. - Where are you taking me?

360
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,440
我覺得他需要呼吸些新鮮空氣
I think he needs some fresh air.

361
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,820
可惡  教練
Damn it, Coach.

362
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:57,000
尼克  你給我認真想想下一步要做的事
Nick! I want you to really think about your next step.

363
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,660
你為什么這么關心
Why do you care so much?

364
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:01,680
這是重要關頭  你人生的十字路口
This is a crucial moment, a crossroads.

365
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,360
如果你吃了它  你就是在告訴我
By you eating that, you are telling me

366
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,470
你寧可坐在沙發上吃餃子
that you'd rather sit on the couch eating dumplings

367
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,160
也不愿意為你的生活做些事情
than do something with your life.

368
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,950
那么  你是個實干者還是個食餃者
Now, are you a doer or a dumpling-er?

369
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,220
抱歉  我不是你  兄弟
I'm sorry, I'm not you, man.

370
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,790
我是個食餃者
I'm a dumpling-er.

371
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,170
是全素的
Oh, it's veggie.

372
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,430
我做的全是無用功嗎
I did all that for nothing?

373
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:22,960
我已經嘗試了
I tried.

374
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,530
你要帶我去哪
Where are you taking me?

375
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,090
什么  你是我的小煙槍
What? You're my smoking gun.

376
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:27,810
溫斯頓坐輪椅了嗎
Winston's in a wheelchair?

377
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,900
意大利著名喜劇演員  奧斯卡影帝

378
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,900
下一步會怎樣  羅貝托·貝尼尼穿過長廊
What's next, Roberto Benigni coming through the halls,

379
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,300
讓所有人都發笑嗎
making everybody laugh?

380
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,330
什么都沒能參與到
Missing everything.

381
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,780
拿這個
Take these.

382
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,410
別說話
Don't even talk.

383
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:43,210
我朋友對你的食物過敏
My friend is having an allergic reaction to your food.

384
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,220
-你好  -菜單上
- Hey, man. - It says

385
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,910
寫著"不含味精"
"No MSG" on the menu.

386
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,600
另外還寫了
It also says it with the--

387
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,510
你管一個圓圈中有一條斜線的標志叫什么
what do you call the circle with the diagonal line?

388
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,280
-那是捉鬼敢死隊之類的標志  -什么
- It's the Ghostbusters thing. - What?

389
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,810
電影捉鬼敢死隊里的標志
From the movie Ghostbusters.

390
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,390
上面寫著那句話
Oh, it says it with words

391
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,330
還有捉鬼敢死隊的標志
and it says it with the Ghostbusters thing.

392
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:57,390
好了  冷靜點
All right, just calm down.

393
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,460
不  這就是接下來會發生的事
No, here's what's going to happen.

394
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:01,200
你要停止到處亂發這些菜單
You're going to stop putting these menus everywhere,

395
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,630
不然的話我就告訴別人
or I'm going to show the people

396
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,750
吃了這里的食物會變成什么樣
in here what happens when you eat the food.

397
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,190
我其實很喜歡這里的食物
I actually like the food.

398
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:08,520
聽我說  杰茜  中國的食物都含味精
Listen, Jess, Chinese food is MSG.

399
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,270
美國人生活在謊言中
America is living a lie,

400
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:12,590
而且我們發菜單人們才有餐可點
and we distribute menus so people order the food.

401
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,610
你就是要接受這些潛規則
Just accept that that's the way things are!

402
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:18,500
不  我受夠了接受這些潛規則
No, I am done accepting things the way they are,

403
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,350
因為到處都是這些菜單
because there are menus everywhere,

404
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:23,740
還有那些想要看大海的孩子們
and there are kids who want to see the ocean.

405
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,330
你在說什么
What?

406
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,320
還有我不喜歡你的氣場  伙計
And I don't like your vibe, dude.

407
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,800
這就是我朋友吃了這里東西的后果
This is what eating here did to my friend.

408
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,220
那個是炒干面嗎
Is that crispy noodles?

409
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:38,420
教練
Coach.

410
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,180
噢  不  不*
*Oh, no, no.

411
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,170
你在干什么  伙計
What the hell are you doing, man?

412
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:44,310
我在彈島嶼的節拍
I'm making Island Beats.

413
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:46,770
我覺得這就是從今以后我要做的事情
I think this is what I'm gonna do from now on,

414
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,490
因為顯然我做不了教練了
since, obviously, I can't coach.

415
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,510
我以為我們只是瞎鬧鬧
I thought we were just messing around.

416
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,650
為什么你把它變得這么復雜
Why are you taking this so hard?

417
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:55,250
因為  伙計  我想證明給自己看
Because, dude, I was trying to prove to myself

418
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,840
我還能做這些事
that I could still do this.

419
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:00,380
自從瑪莉亞和我分手后  不知怎么回事
Ever since Malia broke up with me-- I don't know--

420
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:03,530
我一團糟  感覺自己一無是處
I've just been a mess. Feel like I can't do anything right.

421
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,470
親們  一會能鎖上  一會又鎖不上了
Guys, it's locked, it's unlocked.

422
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:07,770
把它修好吧  說真的
Get it together for real.

423
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:08,850
你來這干什么
What are you doing here?

424
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,340
你不是說你忙得很嗎
I thought you said you were so busy.

425
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,790
我找到了一只多余的鬧鐘
I found this extra alarm clock,

426
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,570
我覺得這是表達鄰里友好的好禮物
and, uh, I thought it'd be neighborly,

427
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15,650
所以我會幫你們放好
so I'll set it up for you guys.

428
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:16,990
別客氣
You're welcome.

429
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,620
等一下
Wait a second.

430
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:22,560
-那是什么  -什么是什么
- What is that? - What's what?

431
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,140
那是攝像頭嗎
Is that a camera?

432
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,020
斯密特  你在監視我們嗎
Schmidt, are you spying on us?

433
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,540
這是個...  這是個攝像頭
So... It is... it's a camera.

434
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,510
真雷到我了
Well, I'm shocked.

435
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:33,380
斯密特  是你決定要搬出去的
Schmidt, look, you decided to move out.

436
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,960
-那就搬走吧  -我已經搬走了
- So move out. - I am out.

437
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,670
其實我很忙的  知道嗎
I'm actually very busy, you know that?

438
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,030
事實上我已經遲到了
I'm actually late

439
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:40,320
我有一個很重要的咖啡約會是和...
for a very important coffee with a...

440
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,980
和我的一個好朋友
with a dear friend of mine.

441
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:43,570
誰呀
Who's that?

442
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:44,800
-是誰  -沒錯
- Who? - Yeah.

443
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,210
你想知道嗎
Wouldn't you like to know?

444
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,210
緊身褲小哥*
*Tiny pants man

445
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:52,980
他沒有朋友*
*He don't have friends

446
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,030
這就是為什么他買了那個鬧鐘*
*That's why he got the clock

447
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,970
他要用那個鬧鐘來觀察他僅有的朋友們*
*He got the clock to watch his only friends

448
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,220
你們用餐愉快嗎
Are you enjoying your meal?

449
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,640
溫斯頓吃的時候也很愉快  對吧
Winston enjoyed his meal, right?

450
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,690
-直到他過敏了  -我們走吧
- Until he had an allergic reaction. - Let's go.

451
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:06,700
看見沒  我趕走了你所有的客人
There. I drove away all of your customers,

452
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,230
而且我打算每天如此
and I'm gonna do that every day

453
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:10,570
直到你停止發菜單為止
until you stop with the menus.

454
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:14,240
-地球戰士  -你贏了  我不發了
- Earth warrior! - You win. I'll stop.

455
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,250
謝謝
Thank you.

456
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,000
查爾斯
Charles?

457
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:20,210
你被解雇了
You're fired.

458
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,390
-什么  -不  天哪  天哪
- What? No! - Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

459
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,770
-天哪  上帝啊  -你不能炒了他
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - Don't fire him.

460
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:25,810
他就是負責發菜單的
He's the menu guy.

461
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:27,070
我只是想有所改變
I was just trying to make a difference.

462
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,120
你做到了  今天早上這個人還有工作
You did. At the beginning of the day, this guy had a job.

463
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,800
現在他沒了  祝賀你勝利了  你贏了
Now he doesn't, so congrats on your victory. You win.

464
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,420
你有教書的經驗嗎
Do you have any teaching experience?

465
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:41,370
誰有抗組胺劑嗎[治療過敏的藥物]
Does anyone have an antihistamine?

466
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,720
知道嗎  我只是搬到了樓道的另一邊
You know, I just moved across the hall,

467
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,640
但感覺卻像是搬去了大洋彼岸
but it feels like I moved across an entire ocean.

468
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,570
人都會長大  尤其是年輕人
People grow up, especially young people.

469
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:57,590
所以我的朋友就一點都不想我嗎
So my friends don't even miss me anymore? Uh-huh.

470
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,960
他們不想你
Well, they don't miss you.

471
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,930
他們向前看了
They've moved on.

472
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:01,940
什么
What?

473
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:04,150
你怎么知道
Well, how do you know that?

474
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,430
因為是他告訴我的
Because he told me.

475
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,220
他叫康納  他去了賓漢姆大學
His name is Conner, and he went to SUNY Binghamton.

476
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,560
我以前和四十只鳥住在一起
I once lived with 40 birds,

477
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,790
后來它們都飛走了  我就向前看了
and they all flew away, and I moved on.

478
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:22,030
慢點吃面條  兄弟
Slow down on the noodles, buddy.

479
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:24,430
祝賀你  米勒  你是對的
Well, congratulations, Miller. You were right.

480
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,260
怎么了
What happened?

481
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,060
我恐嚇了一家餐館
I terrorized a restaurant.

482
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:29,050
我讓一個好人失業了
I got a good man fired.

483
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:30,990
我好像用輪椅碾死了一只蜥蜴
I might have ran over a lizard with my wheelchair,

484
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,770
我很愧疚
but I am ashamed of it.

485
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:34,600
這就是你努力的結果
So, that's what you get for trying.

486
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:38,080
讓我嘗嘗敵人的味道
Let's see what the enemy tastes like.

487
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,940
-美味啊  -誰能帶我去上個廁所
- It's good. - Anybody want to help me use the bathroom?

488
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,720
-不  -好吧  我自己來
- No. No. - Okay, I'll work it out.

489
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:45,140
我都不該嘗試的  結局就是受傷
I shouldn't have even tried. You just get hurt.

490
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,550
這真是種解脫啊
This is such a relief.

491
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,750
現在我可以變胖了
I can get fat now.

492
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,770
伙計們  停下來
Hey, guys, stop it!

493
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,320
我想一整天都吃這個東西
I want to eat this all day.

494
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,320
我們就像是中國食物粉絲團
Like a Chinese food menage. Oh!

495
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,670
你們都是實干者  而跟我一樣的人
Okay, you guys are doers, and people like me,

496
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:57,750
什么都不干的人
people who don't do anything--

497
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,330
事實上我們需要你們這樣的人
we actually need people like you.

498
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,860
天哪  這樣可不好
Oh, boy, this is bad.

499
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,920
好吧  就這么辦
Uh, this... Okay, all right.

500
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,260
我要給你們做段演講
I'm gonna give you guys a speech,

501
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,680
它會讓你們振作起來
and it's gonna fire you guys up.

502
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,030
-掉了一點兒在褲子上  -首先我們從贊美開始
- Got some on my pants... - First we're gonna start with compliments

503
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:12,790
來構建你們的信心
to build up your confidence. Okay, uh,

504
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:14,740
教練  你是位很棒的家伙
Coach, you're a great guy.

505
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,500
你身材很強壯
You've got strong bodies.

506
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,910
什么
What?

507
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:20,980
你只是需要更多的客戶  我相信你
You just need some more clients. I believe in you.

508
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,210
-謝謝  -杰茜  你棒極了
- Thanks. - Jess, you're awesome.

509
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:24,850
你是我目前遇到過的
You are the most resourceful,

510
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,650
最足智多謀  樂觀開朗
optimistic, amazing person

511
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:28,020
令人驚奇的人
I've ever met in my life.

512
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,760
我甚至沒法讓孩子們去野外考察
I can't even get my kids on a field trip.

513
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,310
你可以做你想做的任何事
You can do anything you put your mind to '

514
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,980
因為你狠聰明  知道嗎
cause you're smart, okay?

515
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,330
他們為什么沒法去野外考察
Why can't you get 'em on this field trip?

516
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,020
根本沒辦法讓他們去海灘
There's no way to get them to the beach.

517
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:38,330
那就是困難  客服它
That's a board. Karate-kick it!

518
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,230
你不經常給人做演講吧  是吧
You're not used to making speeches, are you?

519
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:42,710
關鍵一點就是  永不放棄
Point of it is, is you never give up.

520
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:48,930
好吧  我猜你們贏了
Fine. I guess you win.

521
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:50,140
我有點懷念在這里了
I sort of miss being here.

522
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,980
監視攝像頭可以撤了
Well, the nanny cam kind of gave it away.

523
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,960
由于沒人幫我
Well, nobody helped me,

524
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,820
-所以現在真是一團糟  -嗨  溫斯頓
- so now there is a real mess. - Hey, Winston,

525
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:56,780
你能借我們一點兒錢嗎
do you have some money where we could rent,

526
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:59,210
能夠租車或者租巴士之類的
like, a car or a bus or something?

527
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:01,070
我還是在溝里發現這個輪椅的呢
I found this wheelchair in a ditch.

528
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,940
有人能告訴我發生了什么嗎
Is anyone gonna tell me anything that's going on?

529
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,410
停  如果不是有關于租小車或者中型車的主意
Stop! If it's not an idea about how to rent a car or a van,

530
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:07,930
我就不想聽
then I don't want to hear it!

531
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,900
等一下  尼克
Wait a minute. Nick?

532
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,450
太聰明了
That's brilliant!

533
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:14,850
小伙伴們  交通工具是由
Boys and girls, transportation provided

534
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,170
洪福飯店提供的
by Hop Foo's restaurant.

535
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:18,410
好了  同學們  我們到了
All right, everybody, we did it!

536
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:23,240
海洋保護日  現在開始
Ocean Conservation Day starts... now!

537
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,990
歡迎來到太平洋
Welcome to the Pacific Ocean!

538
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:29,070
世界上最大的海洋就在我左邊
Yeah. The large body of water to my left.

539
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:33,400
不準胡鬧  孩子們  不要和陌生人說話
No horseplay, guys. Guys, don't talk to strangers.

540
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,890
你還說
And you said

541
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:36,870
-這不會合適  -我知道它很合適
- it wouldn't fit. - I knew it would fit.

542
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,480
我只是不想讓你把它帶來
I just didn't want you to bring it.

543
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,700
小心  輪子有點問題
Careful. It's got a trick wheel.

544
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,270
-沒事的  -好吧

但我覺得這個禮物應該屬于尼克·米勒
But you know what? I think this actually belongs to Nick Miller,

552
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,900
都是他的功勞
'cause he did this.

553
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,840
這位是你父親嗎
Is this your dad?

554

你覺得我是有多老  小姑娘

555

好吧
All right.

556
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,120
我不想要這個禮物
I don't want this gift.

557
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,780
這是她最喜歡的帽子
It's her favorite hat.

558
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,930
你做出了改變  感覺怎么樣

562
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,320
教練  你想教我嗎
Hey, Coach, you want to show me how?

563
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,700
-教你怎么跑  -來吧  教教我
- How to run? - Come on. Coach me!

564

這樣對嗎  教練  我做得對嗎
Is this right, Coach? Am I doing it right?

565
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:37,310
米勒  你是人類的奇葩
Miller, you sorry excuse for a human being,

566
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:39,150
你就像豆袋椅一樣
you are shaped like a bean bag chair!

567
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,530
我要坐死你
I will sit in you!

568
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,590
-你能行的  -我也要來
- Ah, you can do it. - I'm coming, too.

569

我是沙灘形的
I am all-terrain, baby.

572
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,050
我以前看錯你了  好嗎  你不是一個隨便放棄的人
I was wrong about you, okay? You're not a quitter.

573
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:55,480
現在請放棄
Now, please, quit!

574
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,950
我很高興看到這些
I'm glad I got to see that.

575
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,280
施密特
Oh, Schmidt,

576
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,650
把鑰匙還給你
here's your key back.

577
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:04,150
我們喜歡你在身邊
We kind of like having you around.

578

謝謝
Thanks.

579
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,490
不過這只是個備用的
This is just a copy, though.

580
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:12,210
我有差不多五十把放在家呢
I have, like, 50 of them at home.

581
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:13,640
他們要對我干嘛
What are y'all doing to me?

582
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,360
你的學生們在掩埋溫斯頓呢
Your students are burying Winston.

583
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,530
他喜歡這樣
Ah, he likes it.

584
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:18,260
離我遠點  聽著  你爸媽在哪兒
Get away from me! Look, where your parents at?

585
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:20,310
讓開  熊孩子們
Shoo, children! Shoo!

586
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,900
走開
Away now! Away... be away!

587
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,610
-一邊去  -看我一身沙
- Shoo. Get out of here. - All the sand!

-閉嘴  溫斯頓  -我是家人
- Shut up, Winston! - I'm family!

589
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:29,490
你不能這樣對我  你太壞了  你在干嘛
You can't do this to me! You're so mean! What are you doing?

590
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:34,210
-這是報應  -可憐的溫斯頓
- This is karma. - Oh, Winston.
