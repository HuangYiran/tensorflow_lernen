像是警车那种

15
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,060

00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,570
也许我该去住酒店
Yeah, maybe I should find a hotel, huh?

101
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,470
我家沙发怎么了
What's wrong with the couch?

102
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:38,350
没什么  等一下
Nothing. Yep. Oh, hold on.

103
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,200
差点忘了  给你
I almost forgot. Here.

104
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,370
这是干什么
What's that for?

105
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,840
买花的钱
For the flowers.

106
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,920
给吉蒂买的花  我不是向你借过钱吗
For Kitty. See, I borrowed some money.

107
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,890
现在还给你
So I'm paying you back.

108
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,150
对  谢谢
Okay. Thank you.

109
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,700
客气  该我谢谢你
Yeah. Thank you.

110
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,320
牙套取下来之后
What's th first thing you're gonna eat

111
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,960
你最先要吃什么
when these things come off?

112
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:18,150
别说话  坚持住  
Don't talk. Hold on.

113
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,940
我手头有件大案
I'm working the case of a lifetime.

114
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,570
好  行了
Yeah, all right.

115
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,690
是跟专案组合作的
I'm working with task force.

116
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:23,760
知道了
All right.

117
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,750
需要保密  所以不能跟你说
Confidential stuff, can't... tell you about it.

118
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:30,180
搞定了
All righty.

119
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,810
我发誓  我真的不在乎她

120
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,270
我不相信你

121
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,860
你是来拿衣服的吗

122
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,820
还是来骚扰我的

123
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:56,240
我们不要把问题变得更复杂

124
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:06,040
没有  你只是跟那个女人上床了而已

125
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,840
现在你又跟你的搭档上床

126
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:11,800
桑娅吗  当然没有

127
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,350
昨晚你在哪里睡的

128
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:20,520
在她的公寓里  但是

129
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,690
我没跟她上床  我睡的沙发

130
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:25,900
难以置信

131
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,820
我想回来住

132
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,240
我想跟我的家人  跟你在一起

133
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,290
但我不想让你回来

134
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:43,210
既然你这么说

135
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,790
格斯要退学了

136
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,710
如果你这么在意你的家人  就去跟他谈谈

137
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:51,630
我要去上班了

138
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,390
我不想回来还看到你在这里

139
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,530
-喂  -克罗斯警探
- Hello? - Detective Cross?

140
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,790
-对  是我  -我好像找到了
- Yes, I'm here. - I think I found it.

141
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:32,320
车的交易地点是
The car was purchased at...

142
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,950
关于车我找到了点线索
I got something on the car.

143
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,370
马可去哪了
Where's Marco at?

144
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,280
他回家跟妻子争辩去了
He went home to argue with his wife.

145
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:42,320
好吧  车有什么线索
Right. What about the car?

146
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,760
从发动机上找到了车辆识别码中的三位数
They pulled three digits of a VIN from the engine block.

147
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,270
但和所有挂失的皇冠维多利亚都不匹配
Doesn't match any stolen Crown Vics.

148
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:49,130
说下去
Go on.

149
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,190
但是与五年前在拉斯・克鲁塞斯的
But I have a partial match on a car

150
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,800
一个拍卖会上卖出的一辆车
that was sold by a auction

151
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,030
有部分匹配
in Las Cruces five years ago.

152
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,930
我跟拍卖行那边打了一上午电话
I've been on the phone with the auction house all morning.

153
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,620
他们把交易记录找出来了
They dug up the sale.

154
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,900
有买主的名字吗

157

158
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,500
抱歉  我迟到了

家里情况怎么样了

很糟  可能还恶化了
Bad. Maybe worse.

161
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,320
很遗憾
Sorry to hear that.

162
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,790
世事如此
It is what it is.

163
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,410
你去跟着桑娅吧

我们都想这样  对吗

但你是有夫之妇

我们可以再等等  等时机合适

192
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,220

197
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:58,360

你想让我把她带走吗
Do you want me to take her?

216
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,590
不顾她的个人意愿  强行带去鲍勃那吗
Take her to Bob's? Against her will?

217

我希望你能和她谈谈

-我的话她听不进去  -我不是传话的
- She won't listen to me anymore.  - I'm not a messenger.

我只负责送人
I'm a conduit.

220
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,980
我已经束手无策了
I don't know what else to do.

221
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,900
好了  别哭了
Okay, don't cry.

你看起来帅呆了  陛下

227
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:04,810

对不起  先生  对不起

229
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:19,200
混账东西

230
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,950
说话小心点  混蛋

231
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:28,290
我喜欢看你穿西装

232
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,170

233
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,540

240
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,080

241
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:04,510
没事  不要怕
Don't... don't be scared.

242
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:11,520

You're my mother's stupid gringo coyote.

246
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,710
我不觉得自己是什么
Well, I don't consider myself...

247
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,550
我在我的成人礼上见过你  白痴
I met you at my quinceaera, idiot.

248
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,010
没错
Oh, yeah.

249
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,500
要是我男友发现你跟我说过话
My boyfriend's gonna kill you

250
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,700
他会杀了你的
for talking to me.

251
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,860
是啊  你男朋友肯定是个狠角色
Yeah, well, I'm sure that your boyfriend's a very scary person,

252
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:39,080
让他放马过来  但你得跟我走
and he's welcome to try. But you need to come with me.

253
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,910
不  不要
No, no.

254
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,090
该死  真见鬼
Damn it. Oh, shit.

255
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,460
我不想走  懂吗
I don't want to go, okay?

256
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,850
所以请告诉我妈  别再来这套了  行吗
So tell my mom to stop this shit, okay?

257
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,660
我是想帮你
I am trying to help you.

258
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,100
好吧
Okay.

259
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:19,030
混蛋  快跑吧

260
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,570
什么事都没有  亲爱的

261
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,240
别这样  别  求你了

262
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,570
柴德里斯就住在那个小山丘的顶上
Childress lives at the top of that hill.

263
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,530
这里看上去差不多已经废弃了
Most of these look abandoned.

264
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:34,580
是啊
They are.

265
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,090
大概十年前  这里脑子还正常的人
Chemical spill sent the sane ones running

266
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:38,280
就因为化学品泄露都跑光了
from this area about ten years ago.

267
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:47,450
怎么回事
What the hell?

268
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:49,670
谁会把一辆卡车停在路中间
Who the hell leaves a truck in the middle of the road?

269
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:57,870
还在窗户边留下一架步枪
He left one rifle in the window.

270
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,730
车子是注册在杰克・柴德里斯名下

271
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:15,820
住在麦克纳特路

273
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,530
遵命  长官
Yes, sir.

274
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:24,810
我是库珀  我们在失落的绿洲外
Hey, it's Coop. We got Childress's abandoned

275
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:26,670
找到了柴德里斯丢下的卡车

276
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:28,510
请你们立刻赶来  查看情况
Come on up and let's take look.

277
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,560
我们在路南边400米

杰克・柴德里斯

00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:41,860
有消息称警方正在通缉他
Source told me the police are looking at him...

280
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,210
原因我还不清楚
I'm not sure what's up.

281
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:46,880
这我没料到
It's not what I expected.

282
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,170
什么意思
What do you mean?

283
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:49,860
他和盖德曼有什么关系
What's the connection between him and Gedman?

284
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:53,380
或者跟心理师  马可・鲁伊斯  
Or the shrinker or Marco Ruiz,

285
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,600
23号尸体  甚至我
Body 23, me even.

286
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,900
我们还不能确定
We don't know yet.

287
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,160
跟这家伙产生交集不是巧合
There aren't...coincidences with this guy.

288
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,920
走吧  去他家里看看
Come on, let's go to his house.

289
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:10,360
你自己去吧
Tell you what, you go.

290
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:12,550
你难道没看出来我现在头脑不清吗
I don't know if you've noticed but my brain ain't right.

291
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,320
写什么报道都救不了我
I can't write a sentence to save my life, and I got...

292
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:18,040
我一直头疼得要死
I got this mother of a headache that won' go away.

293
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,490
对于戒酒戒毒  我的身体向我竖起了中指
My body's basically giving me the middle finger for gettin clean.

294
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:23,430
也许你该去看医生
Maybe you should go to see a doctor.

295
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:24,520
是啊  然后他会告诉我
Oh, yeah, why so he can tell me

296
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,810
我是个酒鬼瘾君子无药可救了 
I'm an alcoholic drug addict that's all broken.

299
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,140
我知道

300
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:34,620

305
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,400
确保他没有躲在这些铁皮里
Make sure he's not hiding in any of these tin cans.

306
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,360

312
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,730
斯托克斯副警长  你来这干嘛
Deputy Stokes, what are you doing here?

313
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:27,640

 I got a call about that truck in the middle of the road.

314

曼尼  帮我一个忙
Manny, do me a favor.

319
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:37,880

发现了这个  是一个骨锯

- That's not him.  - Nope. But he knows him.

344
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,100
他说柴德里斯十分钟前来过这里

345
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,350
他去哪了
Where was he going?

346
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:32,700
公园北角  那里有很多空地
North edge of the park. Bunch of vacants down there.

347
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,700
风声紧的时候他就躲在那里

没有  没有他的踪迹
Nope, nothing. No sign of him

352
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:58,440
天这么热  他徒步不可能走太远
Well, if he's on foot he's not gonna get far in this heat.

353
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:00,360
也许有人开车接他

我们的跟他取得联系

356
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,920
给他打电话
Call him.

357
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,040
你真的认为他会接吗
You really think he' gonna answer?

358
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:12,600
他喜欢被人瞩目
Well, he likes the attention.

359
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:14,840
他为此时刻准备着  所以
This is what he's been preparing for, so...

360
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:19,630
-鲁伊斯警官  -什么事  副警长
- Detective Ruiz!  - Yes, Deputy?

-有什么发现吗  -没有
- You got something?  - Uh... well... no.

362
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:28,320
但是  好吧  我只是想问你个问题
But, uh, yeah. Yeah, I just... I got a quick question for you.

363
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:30,960
我不知道你是否注意到
I don't know if you noticed,

364
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:33,330
我今早把背带脱掉了
but I got my braces off this morning

365
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,010
我还真没注意
No, I did not notice.

366
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:37,630
其实我想说的是
Well, the reason bring it up...

367
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,890
当我把它们脱掉时
Well, I was in there getting 'em popped off,

368
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,460
背带弹开的那一刹那
and while they were popping 'em off,

369
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:45,250
我做了一个最光怪陆离的
I just had th wildest, strangest, uh..

370
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:47,130
白日梦  你肯定这么认为
daydream... I think that's what you call it.

371
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:48,760
-好吧  -是关于案子的
- Okay.. - About this case.

372
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,030
-行我知道了  -别走  听我说
- Yeah - No, no, no, listen.

373
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:51,230
基本上我的思路是
So... and basically what I was thinking

374
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:53,460
如果你是那个杀手
was that if you were the killer,

375
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:55,700
而且费尽周折
and you were to go to all this trouble...

376
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,630
-什么  -去弄这些珠子
- Yeah - ...to-to do the beads,

377
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,230
留下这条线索
and-and all these messages...

378
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:07,000
我操
Shit.

379
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,720
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch!

380
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,590
有人开枪  有人中枪
Shots fired! Shots fired! Man down!

381
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:17,090
躲开  躲开
Move! Move!

382
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:18,220

Son of a bitch!

383
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:23,600

White. Brown.

384
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:49,920
妈的
Shit.

385
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:52,980
快点
Come on, now.

386
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:56,230
狗娘养的

387
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,060
距离500码  山顶上
500 yards.Top of the hill.

388
00:27:59,270 --> 00:27:59,940
他在棕色房子里
Brown house.

389
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,110
隐藏在水塔边
He's tucked against that water tower.

390
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:07,630
这家伙回他的房子去了
He's back in his goddamn house.

391
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,300
混蛋
Shit, shit.

392
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:15,080
该死  斯托克斯
Damn it, Stokes.

393
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:24,170
麦克纳特路  房车公园北侧  警员中枪
Mcnutt Road, north end of the trailer park. Officer down.

394
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,240
别呼叫了  咱们去抓他
Forget it!... Let's... go get him.

395
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,340
特警队20分钟就到
SWAT's gonna be here in 20 min.

396
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,800
那时候他早逃远了
He'll be gone by them.

397
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,370
那就赶紧去抓他
So let's go get him!

398
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:37,900
别管特警队了
Forget the SWAT!

399
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:41,900
杰克
Jack.

400
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:44,070
我是杰克请讲
You're on with jack.

401
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:45,990
我联系到他了
I got him!

402
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,100
好的  马可
Okay, Marco..

403
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,140
上吧
Come on.

404
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:51,660
小心点
Be careful!

405
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:52,950
我会分散他的注意力
I'll keep him distracted.

406
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:58,720
你仔细听我说
I need you to listen to me.

407
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:03,030
那我可说不好
Yeah, I-I don't know about that.

408
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:06,490
我看到你了
I see you.

409
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:11,590
我能杀了你
I could kill you.

410
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,480
这可不是体育活动
Almost isn't sporting, is it?

411
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:22,940
结束了
It's over.

412
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:27,380
是啊  结局已定
Yeah yeah, the end is already determined.

413
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:30,350
你杀了警察  警察肯定也会追捕你
You killed a cop, that means cops are coming to kill you.

414
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,520
你入侵我的领地了
Well, you invade my land.

415
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,570
或许你得后退几步
Maybe you got it backwards.

416
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:36,510
特警队正在赶来
A SWAT team's on their way.

417
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,520
是啊  我知道
Yep. I'm sure they are.

418
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,670
但是太晚了  我现在掌握主动
But they're late. I'm in control.

419
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:44,430
听着  你想讲出你的故事
Listen, you want to tell your story?

420
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:46,240
这样你可讲不了了
This is not the way to do it.

421
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:47,450
他们会杀了你的
They will kill you.

422
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,340
我现在还能阻止他们
I can still stop them.

423
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,110
头  我们要怎么办
All right, boss. How we gonna do this?

424
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,220
她正在和他通话
She's talking to him on the phone.

425
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,890
给她五分钟时间
We're gonna give her fiv minutes.

426
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:10,580
你觉得她能说服吗
You think she's gonna talk him out of anything?

427
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,920
就给她五分钟
Five mintues.

428
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:14,460
是  长官
Yes, sir.

429
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:17,540
你为什么不说话了  杰克
Why'd you stop talking, Jack?

430
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:21,410
你想看到我再说吗
Would it help if you could see me.

431
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,830
我也说不清  也好
Oh, I don't know. Yeah, sure.

432
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,320
-杰克  这到底是为什么  -为什么
- Tell me why, Jack. - Why?

433
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:39,280
为什么呢  因为我知道真相
Why? Because I am the truth.

434
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,340
真相
Truth?

435
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:52,320
埃尔帕索地区被边界  文化  历史
El Paso del Norte has been falsely split by borders,

436
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,760
错误的分裂
by... by cultures, by history.

437
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,820
无论你做什么都无法改变这一点
What you're doin won't change that.

438
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,900
试试才能知道
I can try.

439
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,250
这就是你干的事情吗
Is that what you'r doing...

440
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:01,840
完成使命
on your missions?

441
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,170
厉害
Impressive.

442
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:07,360
你也知道  寄生虫和宿主没有区别
Well, you know, parasite, host, same thing.

443
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,800
你为什么要杀这么多人  杰克
Why did you kill so many people, Jack?

444
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,810
一场战争正在边境上演
There is a war happening here at the border.

445
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:24,020
但人们似乎对此一无所知
And no one seems to know about it.

446
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,630
我想把真相公布于众
I want the truth to come out.

447
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,040
狗娘养的

448
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,250
你还有时间
You still have time.

449
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:54,120
所有的制度终将作茧自缚
All institutions eat themselves eventually.

450
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,480
你很聪明  应该可以明白的
You're smart, you know that.

451
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:12,610
你好啊
Hi there.

452
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:14,100
把你的枪放下
Put your gun down.

453
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:16,670
我喜欢近距离枪杀
You know, I like to kill up close.

454
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:18,000
我会开枪的
I will shoot you.

455
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:20,870
我相信你会的
I believe you will.

456
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:35,110
桑娅
Sonya!

457
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:55,700
别乱动  混蛋

458
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:59,780
老实点
Stay there!

459
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,320
你个狗娘养的
Son of a bitch.

460
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:05,560
放开我
Come on!

461
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,660
你没事吧  桑娅
You okay, Sonya?

462
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:09,060
汉克  她怎么样
Hank! Is she all right?

463
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:11,030
我没问你
I'm not asking about you!

464
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:11,910
她没事
She's all right.

465
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:16,920
她还好吗
Is she okay?

466
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,740
她没事
She's all right.

467
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,140
你还好吗
Hey. How are you?

468
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:37,580
疼的没法呼吸
Sore, can't breathe.

469
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,300
刚才真是
That was..

470
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:46,100
我们抓住他了  都结束了
We got him. It's over.

471
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:49,890
也许吧
Maybe.

472
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:54,570
什么意思  有什么问题
What do you mean? What's wrong?

473
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:56,730
他是疯子
He's insane.

474
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,640
对啊  没错  那又怎么了
Yeah, so, okay. And?

475
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,960
我只是不确定预谋这一切的人会是疯子
I'm just not sure that the man who planned all this is insane.

476
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,530
我们发现了骨锯和汽车
We have the bone saw and the car.

477
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:10,830
你也看到了书里的字迹
You saw the writing in this book.

478
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:12,900
就是他了
It's him.

479
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:34,100
警官
Officer.

480
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:36,150
你可以逃跑的
Could've run.

481
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:38,670
为什么留下了等着挨枪子
Why'd you stay to shoot?

482
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,650
因为任务还没完成
The job wasn't done.

483
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,050
什么
What?

484
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:00,860
我本想杀那个墨西哥人
I meant to kill the Mexican.

485
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,900
孩子们  快进屋

486
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,330
没关系  别管我
It's okay. Don't mind me.

487
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,340
出什么事了  太太
Is there something wrong, Senorita?

488
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:41,740
给你
Uh, here.

489
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:43,450
这是什么
What's this?

490
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:45,580
你的工资
That's you salary.

491
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:50,840
这个是地道的分成
And that's you cut of the tunnel.

492
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:56,230
-不用了  -我们是搭档
- It's okay. - We're partners.

493
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,290
我猜卡尔之前没给过你吧
I assume you didn't have this raise with Karl.

494
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,140
没有
No.

495
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,430
谢谢

496
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,270
还有什么心事吗  太太
Is there something else, Senorita?

497
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:17,090
你觉得我做得对吗
Do you think I'm doing the right thing?

498
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:20,760
我觉得你别无选择
I think you're doing the only thing.

499
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:22,710
你朋友在这会待多久
How long is your friend staying?

500
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:24,690
雷
Ray?

501
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,810
不知道
I don't know.

502
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:29,850
他帮我处理和格雷西拉的生意
He's helping me deal with Graciela.

503
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:30,440
我听说了
I heard.

504
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,430
你信任他吗
Do you trust him?

505
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,560
信任  怎么了
I think I do. Why?

506
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:38,910
没什么
It's nothing.

507
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:42,030
我们是搭档  说实话
We're partners. Say it.

508
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,540
我觉得让他和格雷西拉打交道
I don't think it's such a good idea

509
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,350
不是什么好事
 to let him deal with Graciela.

510
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,460
她和卡尔原来有一套管理办法
Senorita, her and Karl had a way of controlling.

511
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,900
谢谢你给的钱

512
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:57,660
我会告诉雷小心点
I'll tell Ray to be careful.

513
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:02,770
晚安  凯撒
Good night, Caesar.

514
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:04,950
晚安

515
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:19,140
穿梭在
Traveling through...

516
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:21,160
《野火》
"Prairie Fire"?

517
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,710
斯托克斯是个蠢货
Stokes was a moron,

518
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:29,810
但不应该被爆头这么惨
but he didn't deserve to get his head blowed off.

519
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,140
给自己几天时间
Take a couple of days.

520
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,190
好吧
Yes, sir.

521
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,980
我们抓住他了  这就行了
We found him. That's what matters.

522
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:48,870
是吗
Is it?

523
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:52,250
那家伙完全疯了
That dude is gone complete insanity

524
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:55,320
他会在狱中被殴打  织袜子度过余生
and spends the rest of his life beating off and knitting socks.

525
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,870
要真是那样  也就那样了
Well, that's what happens, that's what happens.

526
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:02,100
桑娅真该朝他的额头开枪
Sonya should've shot him between the eyes.

527
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,740
那他就被打死了
Yeah, and that would've made him dead.

528
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,310
我不觉得那样有什么问题  汉克
