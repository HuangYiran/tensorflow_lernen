1
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,880
早说过
I told you

2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,440
我们应该早点返回的
We should have started back sooner.

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,760
真要按你说的回去
If we'd left when you had said,

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,960
我们就只能两手空空到家了
We'd be returning home empty handed.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,840
怎么不走了
Why are we stopping?

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,640
前面有人
I saw someone.

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,480
喂  有人吗
Hello?

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,400
前面没人
There's nobody there.

9
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,000
有人吗
Hello?

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,000
朋友  你没事吧
Are you all right, friend?

11
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,520
你迷路了?
Are you lost?

12
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,040
一年后
ONE YEAR LATER

13
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,240
感应信号增强了
Signal's getting stronger.

14
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,440
这是什么
Hey. what's this?

15
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,280
管它是什么  反正很恶心
It's freakin' creepy, is what that is.

16
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,560
这里有发现
We found something!

17
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,560
我想我们得联系亚特兰蒂斯
I think we'd better contact atlantis.

18
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,760
真不敢相信你要离开这
I can't believe you're leaving.

19
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,520
你感染生病了  我们治好了你
I mean, you're sick, we cure you,

20
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,200
修养了6个月后
You go away for six months to recover.

21
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,400
你终于回来了
You finally come back,

22
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,440
现在才呆了1星期
And now, what, you're here a week,

23
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,880
又要走?
You're leaving again?

24
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,160
抱歉罗德尼  但此时
I'm sorry, rodney, but, for the time being,

25
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,680
我意识到我不属于这里
I've realized that my place isn't here.

26
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,080
什么  你开啥玩笑  你当然是这里的一份子
What? of course it is. what are you, kidding me?

27
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,480
银河系的人们还在遭受病痛
As a doctor, I can't just sit by and do nothing

28
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,080
作为医生  我不能坐视不管无动于衷
While people in this galaxy are suffering,

29
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,360
尤其是当我知道
Especially when I know

30
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,600
我对他们所遭受之苦负有责任
I've had a hand in what's happened to them.

31
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,960
你不可以把这归咎于自己
You cannot blame yourself, all right?

32
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,600
听我说  是迈克尔强迫你帮他的
Look, michael forced you to help him.

33
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,560
撒播毒药的罪魁祸首是他
He was the one disseminating the drug.

34
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,960
是啊  助他改良hoffans的可是我
Aye, and I'm the one who helped the hoffans perfect it.

35
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,960
中校
Colonel.

36
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,680
正好可以帮个忙送我一程
Just in time to give us a hand.

37
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,640
事实上博士
Actually, doc,

38
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,960
你得推迟你的行程了
You'll have to delay your travel plans.

39
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,320
我们刚得到泰迪少校的报道
We just got word from major teldy.

40
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,920
他们发现了另一处迈克尔的实验室
They found another one of michael's labs.

41
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,080
你早应该告诉我咱们要走这么长一段路
I wish you'd told me We'd be doing so much walking.

42
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,280
我没提醒过你吗
Did I forget to mention that?

43
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,320
说是说过
Aye, you did.

44
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,440
但你可没说
You also forgot to mention

45
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,400
我们翻山越岭之后  还得降绳索下山
The fact that we'd be rappelling down the side of a mountain.

46
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,320
我腿都要断了
My legs are seizing up.

47
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,800
这是正常现象
Oh, that's what happens

48
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,160
你在r & r好吃好住6个月无所事事了
When you do nothing for six months of r & r.

49
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,520
谢谢  别忘了我可是在平衡舱里躺了2个月
Not to mention two months in a stasis pod, thank you.

50
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,400
才2个月
Two months?

51
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,600
试试800年
Try 800 years.

52
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,200
你的腿就成橡胶腿了
That'll give you rubber legs.

53
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,280
中校
Colonel.

54
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,240
泰迪少校
Major teldy,

55
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,400
贝克特医生
Dr. beckett.

56
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,000
贝克特医生
Dr. beckett,

57
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,200
少校
Major.

58
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,960
这是米拉中士  波特医生
This is sergeant mehra, dr. porter,

59
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,760
还有你已见过面的维加上尉
And of course, you've already met captain vega.

60
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,080
我没想到你的...
I didn't realize you, uh--

61
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,640
我的小分队都是红色娘子军吗  长官?
That my team was a bunch of girls, sir?

62
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,240
我没打算这么说的
That's not what I was going to say.

63
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,400
不过你既然说到了这点...
But, you know, now that you mention it...

64
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,600
上级指示我要挑选最为出色的队员
Well, I was told to pick the best and the brightest.

65
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,200
有趣的是她们就是这么挑出来的
Funny how that worked out.

66
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,600
是很有趣
Funny.

67
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,960
那么谈正事?
Shall we?

68
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,440
好的
Aye. yes.

69
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,640
我们正经过该地区时
We were passing through the area

70
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:36,040
接收到低能量的类似信号
When we picked up a low-level energy signature.

71
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,080
通过三角定位我们锁定了目标
We were able to triangulate and get a lock on the signal,

72
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,840
最后跟踪到此  地下墓穴
And then follow it down into these catacombs.

73
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,720
要走一段路才到
It's a bit of a walk.

74
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,080
原始信号就是这里发送出来的
The signal finally led us to this.

75
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,320
这是平衡舱
Stasis pods.

76
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,520
我是迈克尔的俘虏时
I spent some time in a number of michael's labs

77
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,200
有段时间就呆在他的实验室里
When I was his prisoner,

78
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,720
但从没看过这样的实验室
But this is one I'm not familiar with.

79
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,800
看起来人去巢空
Well, looks like the cleaning crew

80
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,160
好一段时间了
Hasn't been around in a while.

81
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,080
中士
Hey, sarge.

82
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,880
抱歉  中校
Sorry, colonel.

83
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,480
我们能先别乱碰这里的东西吗
And can we hold off touching stuff here?

84
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,960
我可不希望再让
Last thing I need

85
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,720
3吨碎石给我来个泰山压顶
Is another three tons of rubble falling on my head, all right?

86
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,120
别担心
It's all right.

87
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,320
我已经卸除了安保系统
I've disabled the security protocols.

88
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,280
你能成功卸除?
You can do that?

89
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,200
是啊
Oh yeah.

90
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,880
麦凯这小子怎么不会
Why the hell didn't mckay think of that?

91
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,400
他可是天资驽钝
There was no way for him to have known.

92
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,040
但是得多谢他从倒塌事件里
But thanks to the information that he gathered

93
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,200
收集的信息资料
From that experience,

94
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,040
才使我这次顺利绕过安保系统
I'm able to bypass the security protocols this time.

95
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,440
都得到些什么信息了
What have you got?

96
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,840
一些迈克尔在这个实验室里
Well, data related

97
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,840
做的研究的数据
To michael's experiments in this lab--

98
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,640
看起来相当有价值
This could prove to be very valuable.

99
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,760
但获取这里的全部信息
Going through all of this information

100
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,400
得花上点时间
May take a while, though.

101
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,680
没错
Oh, aye.

102
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,200
也许我们应该得去村子里瞧瞧
Maybe we should go check out the village.

103
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,520
什么村子?
What village?

104
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,200
今早我们发现的
We spotted it this morning.

105
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,080
从这向北走不远
It's just a few clicks south of here.

106
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,280
村民可能有这方面的消息
The locals might have some information.

107
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,440
我想询问村民也比
Well, I guess that beats

108
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,040
干坐着看你们查资料要好
Sitting around here watching these guys read.

109
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,520
中士  你留下保护他俩
Sergeant, you're with them.

110
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,040
确保他们别太走火入魔
Make sure they don't geek out too much, All right?

111
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,560
医生  干得不错啊
Nice work, doctor.

112
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,360
谢谢
Thank you.

113
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,880
非常好
Very nice.

114
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,200
你知道我现在最想要什么吗
You know what I'd love right about now?

115
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,000
让我猜猜  啤酒?
Let me guess. a beer?

116
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,600
是小飞船
A puddle jumper.

117
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,840
如果我知道我们要走这么远
That could've been arranged

118
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,160
我就会早安排一艘过来
Had I'd known we'd be walking for so long.

119
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,640
这地区的植被太茂密了
Yeah, well, the area's too heavily forested.

120
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,960
飞船没法降落啊
There's nowhere to land.

121
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,640
再说  当作运动健身好了
Besides, this is good exercise.

122
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,440
帮你强健骨骼
It firms up your glutes and calves.

123
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,520
是啊  再多走几个小时
Great. couple of more hours of this,

124
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,080
我就可以免去有氧运动了
I can skip my cardio-funk workout.

125
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,920
他们还活的吗
Are they alive?

126
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,760
他们处于休眠状态
They're in stasis...

127
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,400
他们体内物理和化学活动
Their physical and chemical processes

128
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,520
暂时停止运转
Have been suspended,

129
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,440
但是  他们仍是活的
But yes, they're alive.

130
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,760
你能让他们醒过来吗
So can you wake 'em up?

131
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,680
还没有准确搞懂
Well, without the proper understanding

132
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,320
他们各自的情况下
Of their respective conditions,

133
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,640
恐怕这么做会要了他们的命
I'm afraid that might kill them.

134
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,400
那你们就继续将他们冰封
Hmm. so you're just going to keep them on ice

135
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,120
直到你们弄明白为止  是吧
Until you figure something out, huh?

136
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,160
他们早已遗忘自己  遗忘了家人
I guess it doesn't matter to them or their families

137
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,480
这和死去又有什么区别呢
Who've probably written them off.

138
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,880
伙计  这可还能来个阴间大团圆啊  你说是不?
But boy, would that make for one hell of a reunion, huh?

139
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,640
我想我还是去周边查看一下
I think I'm going to check the perimeter.

140
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,880
有需要喊我
Holler if you need me.

141
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,000
抱歉
I'm sorry.

142
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,320
你不必道歉的
You have no need to apologize,

143
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,920
坦白的说  她也不必
And, frankly, neither does she.

144
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,200
她说的对
She's right.

145
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,480
苏醒让他们重聚对他们也不错
Resurrections make for very interesting reunions,

146
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,000
毕竟连自己死了都不知道的人
Especially when the dead man had no idea he was dead

147
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
有个了结也好
To begin with.

148
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,160
对不起
I'm sorry.

149
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,320
波特医生  你怎么想
How about you, dr. porter?

150
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,120
艾莉森
Oh. alison.

151
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,240
艾莉森
Alison.

152
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,320
有什么有趣的经验之谈可以分享下
Any interesting experiences you'd like to share?

153
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,120
近期有没有遭遇过
Encountered any dangerous predators

154
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,600
危险的克隆掠夺者?
Been cloned lately?

155
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,400
没有  但说实话我是刚来飞马座星系
No, but in all fairness, I am new to the pegasus galaxy.

156
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,280
我听说克隆好像都要两年的
And I hear that cloning is more of a second-year thing.

157
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,120
事实上是三年
Third, actually.

158
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,440
等等
Oh, hang on.

159
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,680
怎么了?
What is it?

160
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,560
这跟迈克尔最初制造的
It appears to be michael's earliest version

161
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,400
人虫杂交形态非常相似啊
of a human-iratus hybrid.

162
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,720
有人吗
Hello?

163
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,640
这儿有人吗
Anyone here?

164
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,400
好吧  我们分散开
All right, let's split up,

165
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,240
四处看看
Take a look around.

166
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,960
保持无线电通讯
Maintain radio contact.

167
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,560
遵命  长官
Yes, sir.

168
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,600
维加  你那边怎么样?
Vega, you got anything?

169
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,080
暂时没什么发现
Nothing on this end.

170
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,520
这儿就像刚被扫荡过一样
It looks like the locals cleared out a while ago.

171
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,480
的确如此  我需要知道答案
Yeah. the question's why.

172
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,000
难以置信
Incredible.

173
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,000
据此显示    这些早期的试验课题
According to this, These earliest test subjects

174
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,640
并不是学术上的人虫杂交物种
weren't technically human-iratus hybrids.

175
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,400
它们是其他几种生命形式的结合
They were a combination of several other lifeforms.

176
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,800
这大概就是他停止这项研究的原因吧
Maybe that's why he discontinued this line of research.

177
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,400
难度太大了
It proved overly ambitious.

178
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,800
哦  不
Well, no.

179
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,520
从这来看  这个实验是成功的
According to this, the experiment was a success.

180
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,520
那...这意味着什么
So... what does that mean?

181
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:03,720
或许  这意味着我们无能为力
Well, it means there's nothing we can do for them,

182
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,680
因为这些东西已经不属于人类范畴了
Because these things in here aren't people anymore.

183
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,080
抱歉
Sorry.

184
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,240
没想到把你们吓到了
I didn't mean to startle you.

185
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,600
我只是想让你们知道
I just wanted to let you know

186
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,200
天就要黑了
It's going to get dark soon.

187
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,560
那么我们是要在这挑灯夜战呢
So are we going to make this thing an all-nighter,

188
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,200
还是...?
Or...?

189
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,880
不用了 中士
No, sergeant.

190
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,600
别紧张
Easy.

191
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,800
你们是谁
Who are you?

192
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,040
从哪里来的
Where do you come from?

193
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,560
我们从那个又大又圆的家伙里来
Well, we came through that big round thing.

194
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,720
我们是探险家
We're explorers.

195
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,640
你是谁
Who are you?

196
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,960
我叫米拉鲁斯
My name is mirellus.

197
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,200
米拉鲁斯
Well, mirellus,

198
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,600
你干嘛不告诉我们这里发生了什么
Why don't you tell us what happened here?

199
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,760
人都去哪儿了
Where is everyone?

200
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,760
都走了
Gone.

201
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,160
为什么
Why?

202
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,440
大概一年半之前
It began about a year and a half ago.

203
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,840
周围的东西就开始无故失踪
Locals started disappearing--

204
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,120
首先是周围的森林
From the surrounding forest at first,

205
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,600
然后是这里的村民
And then from within the village itself.

206
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,480
不管白天
Day,

207
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,480
还是晚上
Night,

208
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,400
他们总是毫无征兆的就失踪了
They vanished without a trace.

209
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,120
谁也无法解释究竟发生了什么
There was no reason for what was happening,

210
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,280
唯一的解释就是
No explanation except one--

211
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,920
这个村庄遭到了诅咒  所以我们决定废弃它
This village was cursed, and so we abandoned it.

212
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,920
那为什么你还在这里
Then why are you still here?

213
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,080
我现在住在隔壁的村子
I now live in the next village.

214
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,680
我看到你们从山洞撤离
I spotted you exiting the caves.

215
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,920
我尾随而来是想看看你们在干些什么
I followed you to find out what you were doing here

216
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,760
如果有必要的话
And, if necessary,

217
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,280
好让你们警惕
To warn you.

218
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,440
关于这些山洞你知道些什么
What can you tell us about those caves?

219
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,600
谣传说这里非常危险
They're also rumored to be a dangerous place,

220
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,480
但你们活着走了出来
Although the fact That you survived the visit

221
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,520
说明并非如此
would suggest otherwise.

222
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,800
你们在那发现了什么
What did you find there?

223
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,560
谢帕德中校 收到请回答
Colonel sheppard, do you copy?

224
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,200
贝克特  难道你们已经有结果了
Don't tell me you're already done, beckett.

225
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,520
没有  还早着呢
Oh, no. far from it.

226
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,920
我们下载了一些关于我们药片的资料
We've downloaded some information to our tablets.

227
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,760
我们打算今晚上研究一下
We'd like to go over it this evening.

228
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,120
可以的话  我们今晚打算呆在这里
Ideally, we'd like to stick around,

229
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,000
村子里如果有多余房间我们就正好休整下
Possibly bed down in the village if there's room for us.

230
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,760
哦  看上去这里是有些空房子
Yeah, well, I think there's a little room here,

231
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,840
没错
Yeah.

232
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,840
太棒了  我们这就过去
Great. we're headed your way, then.

233
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,200
抱歉了
Sorry about that.

234
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,280
你们要待在这的话我只能祝你们好运了
I wish you luck,If you're planning to stay.

235
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:05,640
等等
Whoa, whoa.

236
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,600
我们还没聊完呢
We're not finished with this conversation.

237
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,400
天就要黑了  这里可不是什么安全的地方
Night is falling and this isn't a safe place.

238
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,160
我得走了
I must go.

239
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,160
好吧  随你了
All right, suit yourself.

240
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,440
那么  中士
So, sergeant,

241
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,080
听说你在转移之前在星门服役
I hear you served with stargate command before transferring over.

242
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,400
对
Yeah,

243
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,440
但飞马星系上有更多我要找的东西
But pegasus had more of what I was looking for.

244
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,280
你是指什么
And what was that?

245
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,040
那些等待制裁的坏人
Bad guys who need killin'.

246
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,600
在奥利一伙被收拾之后
The milky way just hasn't been the same,

247
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,280
银河系已经不是这样了
since the ori got their butts kicked.

248
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,720
哦  有人可不觉得
Well, some would argue

249
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,880
现在的情况已经好多了
That the situation has actually improved--

250
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,240
怎么
What is it?

251
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,320
我听到了些动静
I thought I heard something.

252
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,360
什么
What?

253
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,040
或许没什么
It's probably nothing.

254
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,840
天啊
Jeez.

255
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,440
好了  我们要向下一个村庄进发了
All right, we're going over to the next village

256
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,800
去跟一些当地居民谈谈
To talk to some locals.

257
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,600
你们需要点什么吗
You guys need anything?

258
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,640
需要什么
Want anything?

259
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,880
如果你刚巧路过星巴克
Yeah, if you happen to pass a starbucks,

260
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,880
帮我带一大杯加三倍糖的香草拿铁
I'll take a grande triple sugar-free vanilla latte.

261
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,280
没问题  中士?
No problem. sarge?

262
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,040
我又要留守了  好吧  长官
I'm babysitting. yes, sir.

263
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,840
我们过几小时就回来
Be back in a couple of hours.

264
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,000
这感觉就像回到大学时代
I feel like I'm back in college

265
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,200
那些为期中考试奋战的日子
Studying for my mid-terms.

266
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,640
深有同感
I know what you mean.

267
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,200
你哪所大学的
Where was that, then?

268
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,760
加州理工大学
Cal tech.

269
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,960
海狸队加油
Go beavers.

270
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,560
是啊
Aye.

271
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,600
你哪年毕业
What year did you graduate?

272
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,800
1996

273
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,120
噢  你还挺年轻的
Oh! so you're just a youngster.

274
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,080
呵呵  谢谢
Oh, thank you.

275
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,960
我只是看到些有趣的东西
I just read something funny.

276
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,000
是很明显的笑话
And really obvious.

277
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,800
不管怎样
Anyway...

278
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,440
什么驱使你来到人马星系
What brings you here to the pegasus galaxy?

279
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,120
这就得归结到我的冒险情结上来
Well, you can just chalk that up to my sense of adventure.

280
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,080
探索陌生领域和未知世界的欲望
A desire to visit strange, unexplored worlds,

281
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,960
和各种新鲜有趣的人类打交道
Meet new and interesting people.

282
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,040
好吧  我去四周巡视下
Okay, I'm going to go check the perimeter.

283
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,160
20分钟后回来
Be back in 20.

284
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,080
除非你们在门把手上挂只袜子
Unless there's a sock on the doorknob.

285
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,320
她很有个性的  是那种
She's a character, that one.

286
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,000
是啊
Yeah.

287
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,840
这雾起的好快啊
This fog sure rolled in quickly.

288
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,160
维加  你确定我们没走错方向么
Vega, are you sure we're heading in the right direction?

289
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,920
差不多吧
More or less.

290
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,280
噢  见鬼
Oh, dammit!

291
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,640
太好了  我的也没电了
Oh, great. mine too.

292
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,400
这雾阻挡了光线
So, the fog's messing with the lights.

293
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,040
让人根本不知道我们这是走在哪
Makes you wonder what we're walking through.

294
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,840
或是呼吸着什么
Or breathing.

295
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,200
怎么了
What's the matter?

296
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,200
我好像看到了什么东西
I think I saw something.

297
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,400
什么
What?

298
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,400
好吧  我也确定看到了些东西
Okay. I definitely saw something that time.

299
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,080
见鬼
Damn.

300
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,240
真吓人
Creepy.

301
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,920
可能只是某种动物
It's probably just some animal.

302
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,600
只是些貌似在跟踪我们的动物?
Just some animal that seems to be stalking us?

303
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,600
真让我心安啊
What a relief.

304
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,720
安静  我好像听到些什么
Quiet. I heard something--

305
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,080
-等等!  -留神  米拉鲁斯.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! easy, mirellus.

306
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,000
怎么了你
What's going on?

307
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,920
恶魔
Demons!

308
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,040
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

309
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,520
他们出现了  在这雾里
They're out there, in the mist.

310
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,840
恶魔?  是啊
Demons? right.

311
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,400
他们在追我
They're after me.

312
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,520
我们都很危险
All of us are in danger.

313
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,680
放松点
Take it easy.

314
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,920
出于我们的本职
With all due respect,

315
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,840
还是不要相信这套吧
We're not buying any of this, are we?

316
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,840
维加  提高警惕
Stay sharp, vega.

317
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,200
我们还是尽早回去亚特兰蒂斯--
Well, let's get back to atlantis before the--

318
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,000
维加
Vega!

319
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
维加
Vega?

320
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,800
真该死
Crap.

321
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,600
撤退
Fall back!

322
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,800
真高兴我们能有机会
I'm really glad That we got this opportunity

323
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,280
一起合作  卡森
to work together, carson.

324
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,320
我也是  艾莉森
So am i, alison.

325
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,200
那是什么
What was that?

326
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,080
我也不知道
I don't know.

327
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,120
中校  一切都好吗
Colonel, is everything all right?

328
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,440
中校  收的到吗  中校
Colonel, do you read? colonel!

329
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,880
无线电信号断了
I'm getting nothing on the radio.

330
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,880
你们到里面去  我到外面看看
Get back inside. I'll check it out.

331
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,880
我和你一起去
I'm coming with you.

332
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,480
你真以为你可以吗
Like hell you are.

333
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,720
我不会让你自己一个人到那里去的
I'm not going to let you go out there by yourself!

334
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,080
中校叫我照应你
The colonel told me to take care of you,

335
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,360
我只是在履行我的职责
That is exactly what I'm doing.

336
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,640
你们两个给我待在这里
You two are staying here,

337
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,440
尽可能远离枪声
As far away from that gunfire as possible.

338
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,200
现在你快进去  锁好门
Now you get inside and lock the door.

339
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:12,840
你不能这样...
You can't tell me to--

340
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,920
这是命令
That is an order.

341
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,400
卡森
Carson?

342
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,600
来吧
Come on.

343
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,600
来吧
Come on.

344
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,080
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

345
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,160
我事前不知道
I didn't know.

346
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,480
你在瞎说什么
What are you talking about?

347
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,920
我的天啊
Oh, my god.

348
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,200
培养仓都打开了
The pods have been opened.

349
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,800
是我
It was me.

350
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,400
我放了他们
I released them.

351
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,000
为什么
Why?

352
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,400
当你问起这个山洞的时候
When you asked about the caves,

353
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,240
我知道你们找到了一些东西
I knew you had found something.

354
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,080
我就自己跑来看看
I came to see for myself.

355
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,320
为什么
Why?

356
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,200
我的太太至今也是下落不明
Because my wife was among the missing.

357
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,280
当我看到尸体都被锁在
When I saw the bodies sealed

358
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,600
培养仓里面时
In those things,

359
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,760
我想那或者是...
I thought that maybe...

360
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,200
我没有想到
I didn't know.

361
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,240
我本以为自己可以救她
I thought that I could save her.

362
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,800
12个培养仓...
12 pods...

363
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,920
说明有12只那种东西在外四野穿梭
That means 12 of those things running around out there.

364
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,400
减去你干掉的那个  也还有11个
Minus the one you took out, that leaves us with 11.

365
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,800
贝克特  波特博士
Beckett? dr. porter?

366
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,600
定是浓雾阻隔了信号
It must be the mist.

367
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,840
我们的手电筒也收到影响
It's messing with our flashlights,

368
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,040
可能现在无线电也不例外了
Probably radios, too.

369
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,920
你的幽灵语好吗
How're your wraith language skills?

370
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,200
应该和你半斤八两吧
I'm guessing about as good as yours.

371
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,680
我们需要联系上贝克特和波特博士
We need beckett and dr. porter here.

372
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,760
那我们去找他们吧
Let's go get 'em.

373
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,160
恶魔还在周围游荡
But the demons are still out there.

374
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,400
我们会回来救你
We'll be back for you.

375
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,760
等等
Wait!

376
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,760
外面已经浓雾迷茫了
It's getting pretty foggy out there.

377
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,400
我们真不该让她自己一个人出去的
I shouldn't have let her go out there by herself.

378
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,800
但是这是她的命令
You were under orders.

379
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,360
我应该坚持己见
I should have insisted.

380
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,120
那她就会采取你的意见了吗
And she probably would've decked you.

381
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,400
你还不是很了解她
You don't know dusty.

382
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,000
那是什么鬼东西
What the hell was that?

383
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,400
可能是她
Maybe she's back.

384
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,840
中士
Sergeant?

385
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,200
中士  是你吗
Sergeant, is that you?

386
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,960
该死
Dammit.

387
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,360
你要干什么
What are you doing?

388
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,680
我要出去
I'm going out there.

389
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,120
达丝蒂叫你在屋里待着
Dusty told us to stay inside.

390
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,200
听着  也许根本没事的
Look, it's probably nothing,

391
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,640
但是以防万一
But just in case it's someone...

392
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,640
我还是带上这个好了
I'd like to surprise them

393
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,800
以备不时之需
Instead of the other way around.

394
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,320
听着  艾莉森
Look, alison.

395
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,800
我没事的  你好好留在这里吧
I'll be fine. you just stay put.

396
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,080
好吗
Okay?

397
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,320
好的
All right.

398
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,880
中士
Sergeant?

399
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,280
米拉中士
Sergeant mehra?

400
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,040
天啊
Dear lord...

401
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,200
来吧
Come on!

402
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,400
谢谢  中士
Thank you, sergeant.

403
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,000
快起来  走
Move it, move it, go!

404
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,440
那是什么鬼东西
What the hell was that?

405
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,040
艾莉森在哪里
Where's alison?

406
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,800
那是什么东西
What were those things?

407
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,800
压低声量
Lower your voice.

408
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,480
我想那些东西是靠声音来辨位的
I think those creatures hunt by sound.

409
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,800
天啊
Oh, god.

410
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,960
看到你们的反应
Judging from that,

411
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,320
相信你们也知道发生什么事了
I'm guessing you already know what's going on?

412
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,400
上尉人呢
Where's the captain?

413
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,640
她被杀了
She's gone.

414
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,200
波特在哪里
Where's porter?

415
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,520
我们也不知道
We don't know.

416
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,560
真好
Oh, that's great.

417
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,920
它们现在只要
All we need now

418
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,480
来招瓮中捉鳖
Is for the prom queen and the kid in the wheelchair

419
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,120
我们就玩完了
To wander off and we're all set.

420
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,200
我们要找到她
We have to find her.

421
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,400
她不知道外面的情况
She has no idea what's out there.

422
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,000
外面究竟怎么了
What the hell is out there?

423
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,320
迈克尔的试验
Michael's experiments.

424
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,320
是的  这个我们也想到了
Yeah, I think we figured that one out.

425
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,680
这是早期的混合人
It's an early version of the hybrid

426
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,680
经过基因变异选择
That's been genetically altered to incorporate

427
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,000
融入了不同生物掠夺的天性
The predatory characteristics of several other creatures.

428
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,080
那是什么生物
What other creatures?

429
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,600
我也不知道
I'm not sure.

430
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,960
我只知道
All I know for certain

431
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,880
他们都是没有视觉  但听觉极其灵敏
Is that they're blind and they hunt by sound.

432
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,000
外面的层层浓雾
And that fog out there,

433
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,560
绝非自然现象
It's not a natural weather phenomenon.

434
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:13,520
我看到浓雾从他们脖子旁的腮上渗出来
I saw one of them exude the mist from the gills in its neck.

435
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,840
什么  像乌贼喷墨汁那样
What, like a squid releasing its ink?

436
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,840
但是那是防御敌人的条件反射
Except that's a defensive mechanism.

437
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,800
明显那东西利用浓雾做掩护
These creatures clearly use the fog

438
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,440
进行掠食
As a predatory device.

439
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,440
那就解释了实验室里那个防毒面具的问题
which i think can explain the gas mask back in the lab

440
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,800
天知道
God knows

441
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,880
外面的雾气会对我们有什么影响
What prolonged exposure to this mist could do to us.

442
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,880
我有个好提议
I got a great idea.

443
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,720
不要去理它
Let's not find out.

444
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,800
我们应该在这里待到天明  这样准保险
We should wait here until dawn. then it will be safe.

445
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,200
外面的生物可不是夜猫子
Those things out there are not nocturnal.

446
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,560
不管白天还是晚上  照样行动自如
Day or night, doesn't matter.

447
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,200
再者  我们不能干坐在这  我们得找到波特
Besides, we can't sit around. we got to find porter.

448
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,640
你不是说真的吧
You can't be serious?

449
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,920
你要到外面去?
You're going out there?

450
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,200
快去查查那些数据
Get back to work on that data.

451
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,200
找个办法解决掉那些东西
Try to figure out a way to deal with those things.

452
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,080
这可能有点棘手  中校
That might be a problem, colonel.

453
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,840
迈克尔放弃这个试验的原因就是...
There's a reason michael abandoned that research...

454
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,800
他本人也无法控制那些生物
Even he couldn't control those creatures.

455
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,840
太好了
Great.

456
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,760
好了  你确定在这没事吗
All right, you sure you'll be okay here?

457
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,280
只要大家都安静
As long as we're quiet,

458
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,120
我们就没有危险
We'll be safer in here than you are out there.

459
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:20,560
好的  扩大搜索范围
All right, we'll split up to cover more ground.

460
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,080
8点集合
Back in 20.

461
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,080
祝你好运
Good luck.

462
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,000
无论做什么  小声为上
Whatever you do, be quiet.

463
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,520
这是个错误
This was a mistake.

464
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,040
小声点
Keep your voice down.

465
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,320
我警告过他们  这样做太危险了
I told them it was too dangerous!

466
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,440
小声点
Shh! quiet.

467
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,200
我们该去别的村庄
Instead of coming back here,

468
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,360
而不是回来
We should have gone to the next village.

469
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,760
那就会很安全了
We'd be safe there!

470
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,640
闭嘴
Shut it!

471
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,480
现在我们全都...
Now we've put all of our--

472
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,200
艾莉  你还好吗
Ali, you okay?

473
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,440
是的
Yeah.

474
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,000
我们走吧
Let's head out.

475
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,400
中校
Colonel.

476
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,200
这是泰迪少校
It's major teldy.

477
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,640
她没看见我们
She doesn't see us.

478
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,360
盯着6点钟方向
Take the six.

479
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,360
好吧
All right.

480
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,840
我以为你死了
I thought you were dead.

481
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,440
我也以为你死了呢
Yeah, for a while there, so did i.

482
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,480
其他人呢
What about the others?

483
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,560
他们逃脱了吗
Think they made it out?

484
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,000
我想至少有一个没那么侥幸
Well, I'm guessing at least one of them didn't.

485
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,640
这儿有血迹
We got blood.

486
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,960
卡森?
Carson?

487
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,680
不得而知了
No way to know.

488
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,520
这些东西  就这样从井里爬了出来
One of those things came crawling right up out of the well.

489
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,360
让我想起了些事
It got me thinking.

490
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,200
这些地下墓穴
Those catacombs,

491
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,800
它们向四面八方蜿蜒数英里
They run for miles in every direction.

492
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,440
我想它们应该是直接和那井是连接起来的
I'm guessing that one of them runs right to that well

493
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,080
通到镇中心
And into the center of town.

494
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,480
这就说明了为什么迈克尔可以
That would explain how michael could

495
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,080
神不知鬼不觉的清除掉他的实验项目
Snag his test subjects without being seen.

496
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,480
好吧
All right, well,

497
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,000
我们在实验室里找到12个平衡舱
We saw 12 of those pods in the lab.

498
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,280
在森林里我也干掉了一个
I killed one back in the forest, so--

499
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,440
我也解决了2个
I tagged two--

500
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,000
恰巧让我领先了
Which, incidentally, puts me in the lead.

501
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,600
这样看来
All right, well,

502
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,200
还有9个
That brings us down to nine.

503
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,280
很好  接下来呢
Okay, so, now what?

504
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:59,120
想到什么了吗
Any ideas?

505
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,040
那些生物
Well, those creatures

506
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,680
听觉系统得以强化
Possess a heightened auditory system

507
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,600
这就使他们不必使用视觉
That allows them to hunt blind.

508
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,440
我们应该利用这一点
We could try exploiting it.

509
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,440
怎么说
How?

510
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,600
我不太确定
I don't know,

511
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,560
或许能够设个陷阱
Maybe luring them into an ambush?

512
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,640
那你觉得该用什么做诱饵
What the hell do you plan on using as bait?

513
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,600
这个
This.

514
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,840
这个方法应该行得通
All right, here's how it's going to work.

515
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,440
你们三个  在高处
While you three are taking up high-ground positions--

516
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:35,080
泰迪和波特在这边  米拉在那边
Teldy and porter here, mehra over here--

517
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,000
地面行动就由我来  我去安放炸药
I'm going to be on the ground, setting charges.

518
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,520
你要把井炸了?
You're going to blow the well?

519
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,880
嗯  我是这么计划的
Yeah, that's the plan.

520
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,600
那你最好弄个定时装置
Okay, well, you better use a timer.

521
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,760
大雾能干扰我们的无线电和手电
If the fog is messing with our radios and flashlights,

522
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,800
那遥控装置很有可能也会受到影响
Chances are the remote detonator won't work either.

523
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,280
那这样吧  我一靠近那个井
All right, once I get to the well,

524
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,840
我就打开电脑
I'll turn on the computer.

525
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,600
我设定的是发射一个超音波的爆炸
Well, I've programmed it to emit an ultrasonic burst

526
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,920
所以会把他们直接引向你
So that'll draw them right to you.

527
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,400
但是要记住  一旦它们靠近了
But remember, if it gets near the fog--

528
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,360
我就把它关小一半
I'll put it halfway down.

529
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,680
既让它们够不着
That should keep it out of reach

530
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,600
而且作用时间也足够长  好把9个都引来
And working long enough to attract all nine.

531
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,480
你们3个  就位以后
You three, take a position,

532
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,680
就不要动了  直到听到信号
Sit tight until you hear a signal,

533
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,840
然后看到会动的就开枪
Then open up on anything that moves.

534
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,080
那用什么做信号
And what's the signal?

535
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,680
那正是炸飞到空中的井了
That would be the well blowing sky high.

536
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,800
那到时候你在哪里
And where will you be?

537
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,080
但愿能够跑得够远了
Well, hopefully as far away as possible.

538
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,240
那要是不成功呢
What if this goes sideways?

539
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,160
不要这么消极  泰迪
Don't be so negative, teldy.

540
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,360
我是认真的  中校
I'm serious, colonel.

541
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,120
你们站好位子  不要乱动
You take up positions, you sit tight,

542
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,840
等着信号  你不要动
And wait for the signal-- you don't move,

543
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,040
不要发出什么声音  直到我把井炸了
You don't make a noise until the well blows.

544
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,320
中校  那...
Colonel, what--

545
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,320
我想我已经说得够清楚的了  中士
I think I've made myself clear, sergeant.

546
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,600
是的  长官
Yes, sir.

547
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,400
都明白该怎么做了吧
Do we all know what we're doing?

548
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,560
是的  长官
Yes, sir.

549
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,640
是的
Sir.

550
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,120
出发
Let's go.

551
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,160
下面出什么事了
What the hell's going on down there?

552
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,080
还不到时候
Not yet.

553
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,760
该死的
Dammit.

554
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,400
再等等吧
Just wait for it.

555
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,760
你还好吗
You all right?

556
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,720
嗯
Yeah.

557
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,000
艾莉森?
Alison?

558
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,680
她很安全
She's, uh, she's safe.

559
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,400
谢天谢地
Thank god.

560
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,960
什么不见了么
What, did you lose something?

561
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,600
C4炸药...
Yeah. my c4.

562
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,920
中校  我们得马上离开这
Colonel, I think it's best that we get moving.

563
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,080
嗯  我也这么想
Yeah, I do too.

564
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,640
来吧
All right.

565
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:20,240
快点快点
Come on, come on.

566
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,280
我看见他们了
I see them!

567
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,320
你现在开枪  有可能会误伤中校
You shoot now, you risk hitting the colonel.

568
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,200
等信号吧
Just wait for the signal.

569
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,560
中校?
Colonel?

570
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,600
就这些了吗
Is that all of them?

571
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,800
八...九...
Eight... nine...

572
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,400
加上之前的3个  那就刚好了
Plus the other three, that makes 12.

573
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,960
抱歉  这才是第9个
Sorry, that's nine.

574
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,480
9加上3  够12个
Plus the three, makes 12.

575
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,760
是啊!
Right.

576
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,040
少校?
Major?

577
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,560
中校  你在哪
Colonel, where are you?

578
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,800
在井底  墓穴里
Down the well, in the catacombs.

579
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,480
我找到贝克特了
I've got beckett.

580
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,080
你们三个下来和我们会合吧
I need you three to rappel down here and join us.

581
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,680
马上就来
On our way.

582
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,920
我真想马上回到亚特兰蒂斯
I just want to get back to atlantis

583
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,200
然后好好睡上一周
And sleep for a week.

584
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:49,720
我了解
Aye, I know what you mean.

585
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,040
我保证这不会太久了
I promise this won't take long.

586
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,480
艾莉森  你还好吗
Alison, are you okay?

587
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,000
还好
Um, yeah.

588
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,360
我能不能留在这里一会儿
Hey, guys, do you mind if I just hang back here?

589
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,480
这一天过得够呛
I've had enough mad science for one day.

590
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,200
当然可以
Yeah, sure.

591
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,480
我留下来陪她
I'll keep her company.

592
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,800
我们马上回来
We'll be quick.

593
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,680
最好能够一次性把这些怪物的数据都弄齐
I want to make sure I get all the data on these creatures,

594
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,800
免得再跑一趟
Save a return trip.

595
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,040
那是什么
What was that?

596
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,320
什么
What?

597
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,200
我好像听到什么动静
I thought I heard something.

598
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,360
放松点呀
Relax, okay?

599
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,720
实验室里有12个舱
There were 12 pods.

600
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,200
我们也干掉了12个
We counted 12 kills.

601
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,600
一网打尽了
We got 'em all.

602
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,200
怎么了
What is it?

603
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,680
噢  糟糕
Oh, crap.

604
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:39,800
有漏网的了
We didn't get them all.

605
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,920
什么都没有啊
It's nothing.

606
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,960
波特?  米拉?
Porter? mehra?

607
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,000
如果它们偷袭过来
If they overtake our position,

608
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,600
我命令你们俩撤退
I want you two to fall back.

609
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,200
从第2个通道走  回到地面上
Take the second tunnel up, go to the surface,

610
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,280
向星门拨号
Dial the gate.

611
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,800
现在轮你消极了
Now who's being negative?

612
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,200
都干掉了?
All clear?

613
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,680
都干掉了
All clear.

614
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,000
真不敢相信你现在就要走了
I can't believe you're leaving already.

615
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,720
你到这儿还不满两周呢
You've been here, like, less than two weeks.

616
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,200
迈克尔的研究项目
Well, I've completed my research

617
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,480
我已经完全搞清楚了
Into michael's test subjects

618
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,800
而且结果已经交接给lynch博士的团队
And passed my findings on to dr. lynch and his team.

619
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,720
现在该回头关注更重要的救死扶伤的事业了
And now it's time to move on to the more important work of saving lives.

620
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,800
嗨  医生
Hey, doc.

621
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,920
或许我言之过早了
Maybe I spoke too soon.

622
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,840
还有什么外世界事件需要我么
Another off-world situation require my expertise?

623
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:40,600
我只是过来看看你是不是需要帮忙
Actually, just came to see if you needed some help.

624
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,480
噢  多谢了
Oh, much appreciated.

625
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,800
那  波特怎么样了
Oh, by the way, how's porter?

626
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,920
谁
Who?

627
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,240
她很好  想在r & r待几周
She's fine-- planning a couple weeks of r & r,

628
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,080
然后会回来飞马座星系的
Then she'll be back in the pegasus galaxy.

629
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,360
你知道的中校  像她这样的人才
You know, colonel, someone like her

630
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,400
对我的工作真的会很有帮助
Could be of real benefit to the type of work I'll be doing.

631
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,400
一定会的
I'll bet.

632
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,200
谁是波特啊
Who's porter?

633
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,720
或许有些事情你得跟伍尔希说说
Something you might want to mention to mr. woolsey.

634
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,000
就当已经说了嘛
Consider it done.

635
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,280
好吧  告诉你们
Fine, you know what?

636
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,320
我才不想知道  不要告诉我
I don't even want to know. don't tell me.

637
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,560
嘿  别走啊  快告诉我
Okay, come on, tell me!
