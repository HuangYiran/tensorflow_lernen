00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:10,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But the scenic route is so much prettier.

00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, let's take the scenic route.        Great.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. Here it is. This is the tree.

103
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on over. This is... Uh, I'm gonna call you back.

104
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,049
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Obviously, it's first growth, indigenous.

105
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:55,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Original dirt floor, good bark, skipping stone hearth... as you can see.

106
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kylie?

107
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,639
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kylie! What'd I tell you? I'm showing the property.

108
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not supposed to be here.        Oh, what time is it? I'm sorry.

109
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:04,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is Kylie. He's the super. He's a little...

110
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's in the bucket, Mr. Kylie?

111
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kylie? Kylie!

112
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just minnows. Try one?        Certainly. Thank you.

113
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not exactly an evergreen, is it?

114
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:21,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aren't there any pines on the market this side of the river?

115
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:24,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, pines are pretty hard to come by in your price range.

116
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:25,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? What? What's that?

117
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,260


118
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,240


119
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:35,470


120
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}May I ask what you do for a living, Mr. Fox?

121
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I used to steal birds, but now I'm a newspaper man.

122
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, sure. I've seen your by-line.

123
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:47,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good afternoon, gentlemen.

124
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're going? You're...        Oh, and Kylie...

125
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you for the minnow. It was superb.

126
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,910


127
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't buy this tree, Foxy.

128
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're borrowing at nine and a half with no fixed rate,

129
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}plus moving into the most dangerous neighborhood in the country

130
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:10,089
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...for someone of your type of species.

131
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're exaggerating, Badger.

132
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sugar-coating it, man! This is Boggis, Bunce, and Bean!

133
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:20,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Three of the meanest, nastiest, ugliest farmers in the history of this valley!

134
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really? Tell me about them.

135
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:24,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alright.

136
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Walt Boggis is a chicken farmer.

137
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Probably the most successful in the world.

138
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:31,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He weighs the same as a young rhinoceros.

139
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He eats three chickens every day for breakfast, lunch, supper, and dessert.

140
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's twelve in total, per diem.

141
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nate Bunce is a duck and goose farmer.

142
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:42,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's approximately the size of a pot-bellied dwarf,

143
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,979
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and his chin would be under water in the shallow end...

144
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...of any swimming pool on the planet.

145
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His food is home-made doughnuts...

146
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...with smashed-up goose livers injected into them.

147
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Frank Bean is a turkey and apple farmer.

148
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He invented his own species of each.

149
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He lives on a liquid diet of strong, alcoholic cider...

150
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:00,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...which he makes from his apples.

151
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:05,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's as skinny as a pencil, as smart as a whip...

152
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and possibly the scariest man currently living.

153
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The local human children sing a kind of...

154
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...eerie little rhyme about them.

155
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:16,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here, listen to this.

156
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}#Boggis, Bunce, and Bean.

157
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:20,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}#One fat, one short, one lean.

158
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}#These horrible crooks, so different in looks,

159
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:25,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}#...were nonetheless equally mean.

160
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In summation, I think you just got to not do it, man.

161
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's all.

162
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:33,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I understand what you're saying, and your comments are valuable,

163
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but I'm gonna ignore your advice.

164
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The cuss you are!

165
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The cuss am I?

166
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:44,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you cussing with me?        No, you cussing with me?

167
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,269
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't cussing point at me!        You can cuss yourself!

168
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:48,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not gonna cuss with me, you little cuss!        Don't cuss with me!

169
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just buy the tree.        Okay.

170
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take a left and then to the right. Set them down.

171
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just another batch. Help that other guy over there.

172
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lift with legs not with your back. Flip it sideways.

173
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't try to be a superman here.

174
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,429
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alright. We got two circles.

175
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:09,889
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got the yellow circle and the green circle.

176
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's just keep them separate. Hold it right there.

177
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:14,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We need to bring about two percent more in.

178
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good. Here we go. A little bit more. A little bit more.

179
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's good.

180
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:19,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's get that bottom structure resettled in.

181
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's bring in the side unit. Watch out!

182
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:22,669
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Try to be careful, you guys.

183
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't... don't peel away the bark.

184
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi.        Hi.

185
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,200


186
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:52,590


187
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's slightly younger, but he's a cuss of a lot bigger.

188
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:59,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's just genetics, I guess. Ash has a littler body-type.

189
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:07,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go!

190
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Watch this, Dad!

191
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, well...

192
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:15,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good jump, Ash!

193
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember to keep your tail tucked!

194
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Still painting thunderstorms, I see.

195
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you still feel poor?

196
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:26,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lesser.

197
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow! Wow! Look at that!

198
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:43,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This kid's a natural! I'm speechless, Kristofferson!

199
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Plus, he knows karate.

200
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you think I'm an athlete?

201
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:04,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you talking about?        Well, you know, I think I'm an athlete,

202
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and sometimes I feel like you guys don't see me that way.

203
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's the sub-text here? Is he praying?

204
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think that's yoga.

205
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How long is Kristofferson supposed to stay with us?

206
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:20,659
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Until your uncle gets better.        Right, but roughly...

207
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...how long do we plan to give him on that?

208
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:25,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Double-pneumonia isn't even really that big of a deal, is it?

209
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:27,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lower your voice, Ash.

210
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who am I, Kylie?

211
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:41,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who how? What, now?        Why a fox?

212
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:44,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why not a horse or a beetle or a bald eagle?

213
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:47,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm saying this more as, like, existentialism, you know?

214
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who am I, and how can a fox ever be happy without a, uh...

215
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...you forgive the expression, a chicken in its teeth?

216
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know what you're talking about, but it sounds illegal.

217
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here, put this bandit hat on.

218
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe you're a medium. Take it off for a min.

219
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And don't wear it around the house.

220
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And so it begins.

221
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:12,119
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you mind if I slide my bedroll slightly out from under the train set?

222
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's hard to sleep in that corkscrew position.

223
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a lot of attitudes going on around here.

224
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:21,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't let me get one.        No, it's only just that my spinal-cord

225
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sleep wherever you want, man. Here, take my bed.

226
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:27,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll just, uh, I'll crawl under the book-case.

227
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:28,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who cares if I get splinters in my ears?

228
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Never mind.        Oh, you're gonna pout about it?

229
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:34,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because I've had it up to... here! With the sad house guest routine.

230
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good night.

231
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:39,280


232
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:44,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I used to do this professionally, and I was very successful at it.

233
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I had to get out of it for personal reasons,

234
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:49,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but I've decided to secretly do one last big job on the sly.

235
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm bringing you in as my secretary and personal assistant.

236
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:53,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay!

237
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:57,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is actually kind of a big deal, so don't just say, "OK!"

238
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Well, thank you.        I'm gonna tape this for my records,

239
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...so don't make a lot of sounds.

240
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Meaning stop rocking.

241
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Master Plan. Phase one. Side A.

242
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:09,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll start with Boggis's Chicken House. Number one.

243
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,279
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His only security is a few old hunting beagles

244
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and a low stone wall.

245
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now a word about beagles...

246
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Never look a beagle directly in the eye.

247
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And if...        Why not?

248
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Beagles aren't so tough.

249
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:23,249
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah? Well, first of all, one of these beagles has chronic rabies,

250
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,599
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...which he's on medication for, and if you get bit by him...

251
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...you have to get shots in your stomach for six months.

252
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, second... listen, I'm not going to justify this to you.

253
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just pay attention and stop interrupting me.

254
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:32,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm taping this.

255
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:34,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I picked some blueberries, and laced each one...

256
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...with ten milligrams of high-potency sleeping powder.

257
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Enough to tranquilize a gorilla.

258
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do we make them eat it?        Beagles love blueberries.

259
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:44,809
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember: they aren't very smart, but they're incredibly paranoid

260
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...so always kill a chicken in one bite.

261
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:48,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One bite, get it?

262
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,709
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you listening to me? I look into your eyes...

263
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and I can't tell whether you're getting anything I'm saying.

264
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,600


265
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Magnesium.

266
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Magnesium!        Sorry.

267
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:06,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pipette.

268
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pipette.        Oh, sorry.

269
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Potassium tri... What are you looking at?

270
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no.

271
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:16,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why's your cousin such a wet-sandwich?

272
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:18,609
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I beg your pardon?        What's that mean?

273
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That means I didn't understand what you just said.

274
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A wet-sandwich?        Yeah, a wet-sandwich.

275
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's too short. He dresses like a girl. He's...

276
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:25,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...different.

277
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:28,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you a bully? You're starting to sound like a bully.

278
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:29,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Watch this.

279
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've just destroyed the whole experiment.

280
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'd better extinguish this magnesium.

281
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:36,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stand back.

282
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:39,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow!

283
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I like your ears.        Mine?

284
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:50,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you! I like your spots!        Really?

285
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I used to cover them up. But, you know...

286
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're supposed to be my lab partner.

287
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:58,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am!        No, you're not.

288
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're disloyal.

289
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:04,390


290
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A few beagles, as we discussed, but we're ready for that.

291
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, but back in the old days,

292
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:29,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}didn't they used to do a thing where if somebody saw a wolf, and...

293
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wolf? What wolf?

294
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:35,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, nothing? Never mind.

295
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here comes the low stone wall. Not a problem.

296
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,929
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the cuss? Where'd this giant fence come from?

297
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We had a master plan!        What's this lightning bolt?

298
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That could mean maybe this fence might be electric.

299
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I just hope it doesn't mean thunder. Because I have a phobia of that.

300
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:06,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Watch this.

301
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Beagles love blueberries! Didn't I tell you?

302
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:34,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The master plan's working again!

303
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now! This is the tricky part.

304
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:38,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One of us got to jump that barbed-wire,

305
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...slide under the tire-spikes, and flip open the fence-latch.

306
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's it gonna be?        Not me.

307
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:45,269
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know who could do this part easily is Kristofferson.

308
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,039
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That kid's like a professional, Olympic-level...

309
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why don't we go around that way? There's no obstacles.

310
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:51,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, that's better.

311
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,159
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I said one bite!        I'm trying!

312
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have a different kind of teeth from you! I'm an opossum!

313
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:08,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give me that.

314
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's so grisly! There's blood and everything!

315
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Follow me.

316
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, what's the master escape plan?

317
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Follow me again!

318
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Quick!

319
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give me that.

320
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alright. Let's hit the five and dime on the way home!

321
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:03,019
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We need to make some fake price tags and wrap these chickens in wax-paper

322
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...so it looks like we got them at the butcher shop!

323
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:15,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where'd you get this chicken?

324
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I picked it up at the Five-and-Dime last night on my way back...

325
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's got a Boggis Farms tag around its ankle.

326
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Must've escaped from there before I bought it.

327
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,789
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's Bunce tonight! He's got a refrigerated smokehouse with

328
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:36,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a hundred geese...        Woah! Woah!

329
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:39,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought you said we were only doing one last big job.

330
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:43,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are, but it's... not done yet. It's a triple-header.

331
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,320


332
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let see some hustle!

333
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Coach, we don't have whack-bat where I'm from. What're the rules?

334
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no whack-bat on the other side of the river!?

335
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:31,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, we mostly just run grass sprints or play acorns.

336
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, it's real simple:

337
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:36,399
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}basically, there's three grabbers, three taggers, five twig-runners,

338
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and the player at whack-bat.

339
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:40,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The center-tagger lights the pine-cone and chucks it over the basket,

340
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and the whack-batter tries to hit the cedar-stick off the cross-rock.

341
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,609
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then the twig-runners dash back and forth until the pine-cone burns out,

342
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:47,049
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and the umpire calls "hot box".

343
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:49,019
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Finally, at the end you count up however many score-downs

344
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,709
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...it adds up to and divide that by nine.

345
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Got it!        Go in for Ash.

346
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Substitution!

347
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:55,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ash, come out! You need a breather.

348
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? I'm out! What?

349
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:00,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I still feel good, Coach! Let me finish this eighth!

350
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:03,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, come on. Step out. Step out. Let's go.

351
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Am I getting better, Coach?

352
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, you're sure as cuss not getting any worse.

353
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really? You think I'd end up being as good as my dad if I keep practicing?

354
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:14,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your dad?

355
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:18,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your dad was probably the best whack-bat player we ever had in this school.

356
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:26,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, you don't wanna have to compare yourself to that.

357
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:30,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, but I think I've some of the same raw natural talent, don't you?

358
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're improving. Let's put it like that.

359
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hot box!        Divide that by nine, please!

360
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:06,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah! That's the first time this kid's ever swung a whack-bat?

361
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He really is your father's nephew, isn't he?

362
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:09,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not by blood.

363
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:11,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No?        He's from my mother's side.

364
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah.

365
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:15,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's that stand for?

366
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:19,409
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Huh? It's for... It's for pep.

367
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:21,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pep? It's a K.

368
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:23,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, now! Look alive! Attaboy!

369
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:25,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're going steady.

370
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's that?        What "what"?

371
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:33,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What this?

372
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's nothing. It's just some old trophy I won for being an athlete.

373
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:41,359
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm supposed to cover this book party at some animal's nest

374
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...in a tobacco field down the hill,

375
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...so me and Kylie are going to hop over there and give it a whirl.

376
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't wait up.        What's the book?

377
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:50,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some memoir. I'll get him to sign you a copy.

378
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dinner was...

379
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:53,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...pitch-perfect.

380
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:00,070


381
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:03,009
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I spotted a couple of broken burglar bars...

382
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:05,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...underneath the back door to Bean's secret cider cellar.

383
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:07,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're breaking into Bean's house?        Cellar.

384
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:09,179
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where he lives?        Where he keeps the cider.

385
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:11,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Below where he lives.        Where'd you come from?

386
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:12,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go back to the tree and do your homework!

387
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:15,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wanna help you steal some cider.        We're going to a book party!

388
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:18,079
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And keep your mouth shut about any cider, because no one ever said that.

389
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now get out of here!        But...

390
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:21,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But nothing! You're gonna get me in a lot of trouble!

391
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:23,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Besides you're too little and uncoordinated.

392
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One, two, three.

393
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where the cuss does that kid get off?

394
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you believe that? How did he get tipped off?

395
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:38,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think he's going to tell on us?

396
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:42,779
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Before we go any further, from now on can you give me some kind of signal...

397
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:45,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...once in a while just so I know any of this is getting through to you?

398
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Was that it? Okay, fine.        There's another one.

399
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:51,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good. You made it.

400
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anybody see you?        I don't think so.

401
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here, put this bandit hat on.

402
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I must say, I'm pleased to be invited, but I'm not sure...

403
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I should be doing this, Uncle Foxy!        Why not?

404
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:03,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because I don't like to be dishonest with people!

405
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, just keep your mouth shut, and it won't be a problem!

406
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:07,049
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, but I don't think he should come with us, either.

407
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:08,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're not taking a vote!

408
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,519
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, one time this wolf I saw...

409
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wolf? What's with all the wolf talk? Can we give it a rest, for once?

410
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:32,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at all this. Apple juice.        Apple juice? Apple juice?

411
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We didn't come here for apple juice.

412
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:37,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is some of the strongest, finest alcoholic cider money can buy...

413
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:38,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...or that can even be stolen.

414
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:42,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It burns in your throat, boils in your stomach,

415
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:45,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and tastes almost exactly like pure, melted gold.

416
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Y'all are trespassing, now. Illegally.

417
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:08,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Around these parts, we don't take kindly to cider poachers.

418
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:10,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've aged badly, Rat.

419
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:14,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're getting a little long in the tooth, yourself, partner.

420
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bean security, what? Why you're wearing that badge?

421
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:20,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is it?

422
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's my job.

423
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How's your old lady doing?

424
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:43,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you refer to my wife?

425
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:46,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She was the town tart, in her day.

426
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:48,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wild and foot-loose and...

427
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...pretty as a mink stole.

428
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that true?

429
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:54,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course, not.

430
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:56,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, certainly, she lived. We all did.

431
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was a different time. Let's not use a double-standard.

432
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:00,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She marched against the...        But town tart?

433
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:01,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shut up.

434
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was close, Rat. Be careful.

435
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I'm as careful as a...

436
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How many jars should I bring up, Franklin?

437
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. Two, I guess.

438
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You drank three yesterday, though.

439
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alright, take three.

440
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, two's plenty.

441
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my cuss. Is she blind?

442
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think she might have astigmatism.

443
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:06,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or possibly a cataract of some form.

444
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anyway, her eyes don't see well.

445
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What'd I tell you? This kid's a natural, am I right?

446
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:27,800


447
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's so good of you to come. Lovely to see you.

448
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:33,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're both looking splendid.

449
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:36,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How've you been, Walter? In good health, I trust?

450
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nathan? All is well? Wonderful.

451
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Any fox problems?

452
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you joking?        It's horrible.

453
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:45,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're miserable.        He's laughing at us.

454
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's humiliating.        We're furious.

455
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't even want to talk about it.

456
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:57,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perhaps we ought to kill him.

457
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, that seems rather obvious.        He's too sneaky.

458
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:05,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah, right. Of course. He's very clever, isn't he?

459
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Might be bit difficult, I suppose.

460
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,909
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I've already figured out where this fox lives,

461
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:20,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and tomorrow night we're gonna camp in the bushes,

462
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:22,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...wait for him to come out of the hole in his tree,

463
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and shoot the cuss to smithereens.

464
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How's that grab you, fellas?

465
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Well, let's see. Why not?

466
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Another book party?

467
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:46,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Woah! I didn't see you, sitting in the dark over there.

468
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, no. Actually, there's a fire.

469
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just got the call. They said maybe it's arson?

470
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:53,639
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got to interview the Marshall and see what's...

471
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kylie, is he telling the truth?

472
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:58,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't want to be put in the middle of this.

473
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks, Kylie.

474
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:03,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why is he wearing that bandit hat?

475
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His ears were cold. He's not with us.

476
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:08,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go back to bed.

477
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If what I think is happening is happening...

478
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...it better not be.

479
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:25,720


480
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nice job covering for me. Next time, you...

481
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:50,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All three!

482
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:51,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kill him!

483
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:17,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got the tail, but we missed the fox.

484
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:21,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Petey! Sorry to wake you.

485
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can trouble you to dash out here right away with, shall we say,

486
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:28,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...three shovels, two pick-axes, 500 rounds of ammunition and, uh...

487
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:30,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...a bottle of apple-cider.

488
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:34,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It'll grow back, won't it?        Tails don't grow back.

489
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tails don't grow back?        Except for lizards.

490
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:38,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tails don't grow back.

491
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:40,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna be tailless for the rest of my life.

492
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:43,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, anyway, it's not half as bad as double-pneumonia, right?

493
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:46,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, his dad's got one foot in the grave and three feet on a banana peel.

494
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:48,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a lot worse than...

495
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:54,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me, everyone. I'm gonna go meditate for half an hour.

496
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've got twenty-nine minutes to come up with a proper apology.

497
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Me? Me, have an apology?

498
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,799
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He gets a bandit hat! He just got here and he got a bandit hat!

499
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's my bandit hat? Why didn't I get shot at?

500
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:09,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's because, you, you... you think I'm no good at anything!

501
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:11,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, maybe you're right! Thanks!

502
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:15,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told you not to bring him.

503
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:18,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why the cuss didn't I listen to my lawyer?

504
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At this point we'll be lucky if we can flip this tree for...

505
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...half of what we've already sunk into it.

506
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:25,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I won't be able to sleep on my back for six weeks...

507
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and on my stomach I feel congested.

508
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why the cuss didn't I listen to my lawyer?

509
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:31,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because you don't listen to anybody.

510
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:35,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What was that?        What? I said...

511
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wake up! Everybody! They're digging us out!

512
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:39,859
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They'll kill the children!        Over my dead body, they will.

513
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:42,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what I'm saying! You'd be dead, too, in that scenario!

514
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,779
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I'm arguing against that!        What are you talking about?

515
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are you yelling at me?        Stop! Stop! Stop!

516
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:48,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You say one thing, she says another, and it all changes back again!

517
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:01,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've got it! There's not a moment to lose!

518
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:03,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why didn't I think of this before?        Think of what?

519
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:05,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've been trapped before.

520
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:08,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dig!

521
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,540


522
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:31,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think it's time for me to give us a pep talk and explain some things.

523
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:35,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A very long time ago...        May I have a word with you privately?

524
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, we're in a hole.

525
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just on the other side of this mineral deposit.

526
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:40,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Follow me.

527
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:45,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna lose my temper now.

528
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When?        Right now.

529
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:51,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, when... Oh, my God!

530
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Twelve fox-years ago, you made a promise to me...

531
00:33:57,590 --> 00:34:00,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}while we were caged inside that fox-trap, that if we survived

532
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:03,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you would never steal another chicken, goose, turkey, duck,

533
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...or squab, whatever they are.

534
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:09,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I believed you. Why? Why did you lie to me?

535
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:15,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because I'm a wild animal        You're also a husband and a father.

536
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm trying to tell you the truth about myself.

537
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:21,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't care about the truth about yourself.

538
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:25,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This story is too predictable.

539
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:29,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Predictable? Really? What happens in the end!?

540
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In the end, we all die...

541
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...unless you change.

542
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Petey, listen.

543
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,639
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Run down to the rentals department over at Malloy Consolidated...

544
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and place an order for, shall we say,

545
00:34:56,570 --> 00:35:01,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}one Mighty Max, one Junior Spitfire, and a long-range Tornado 375 Turbo.

546
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For immediate delivery.

547
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,370


548
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:43,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ash, are you mad at me?

549
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:45,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I understand if you are, and I'm sorry.

550
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wouldn't have ever involved your cousin if I realized you would feel this way.

551
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:51,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was only ever just because he's kind of a natural, I mean...

552
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:53,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, look at him dig!

553
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:58,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anyway, I'm sorry your feelings...        You know what?

554
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna put dirt in my ears.

555
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, that's better. I can't hear you now but keep talking.

556
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't have beagle ticks, by the way.

557
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:29,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa! Me, neither. Whoever said we've beagle...

558
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:32,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Apparently, that's what you've been telling everyone.

559
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Beagle ticks and pelt lice.

560
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:37,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I never said that, and you're misquoting me...

561
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:39,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...or somebody is, but I'm gonna get to the bottom of it.

562
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,729
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, Ash, we may or may not ever see the light of day again,

563
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:44,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but I really like Agnes, and I think she likes me.

564
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great. She's a free agent. What do I care?

565
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:50,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, then why're you dead-set on...        Can I ask you a question?

566
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,139
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You may.        What's the point of sitting on the floor...

567
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:55,209
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with your legs twisted into a pretzel talking to yourself...

568
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:57,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...for an hour and forty-five minutes? It's weird.

569
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:00,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My father and I first started practicing meditation together when I was...

570
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:01,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah? Well, that's great.

571
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:03,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I'd worry more about what that does for your reputation...

572
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:05,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...than whether or not you have beagle ticks or not.

573
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:09,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't. Nor pelt lice.

574
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:17,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One of those slovenly farmers is probably wearing my tail as a necktie by now.

575
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're paranoid, Foxy.

576
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Farmer, thank you.

577
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Correct me if am misreading the data,

578
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you've successfully destroyed the scenery, but the alleged fox

579
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at Dad's tie.

580
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:29,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What will you three prominent farmers do now?

581
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:32,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, Dan, I can tell you what we're not going to do.

582
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:33,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're not gonna let him go.

583
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stand clear, please. Stand clear, everyone.

584
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:50,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Contact!

585
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Boggis, how many men, did you got working on your farm?

586
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,149
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thirty five.        Bunce?

587
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:09,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thirty six.        And I've got thirty-seven. That's...

588
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd say, a hundred and eight altogether.

589
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:15,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Petey!

590
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:18,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Drop everything and assemble all hundred and eight members...

591
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...of our entire three combined work-forces.

592
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're gonna starve them out and then kill them.

593
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:26,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Starting in, shall we say, fifteen minutes.

594
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,130


595
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:30,459
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}An estimated, a hundred and eight snipers are...

596
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:33,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...currently in position surrounding the demolished fox residence.

597
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:37,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Many local animals, who'd appear to be trapped underground,

598
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...without provisions of any kind at this point.

599
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:43,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I had a crystal ball, I'd predict a fairly grisly outcome to the situation.

600
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:46,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But we stand on the scene, watching closely,

601
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...as events continue to unfold.

602
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:53,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is gonna be a total cluster cuss for everybody.

603
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:57,950


604
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:02,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How long can a fox go without food or water?

605
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:05,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I can only answer as an opossum,

606
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:07,349
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but I don't think I can last more than another couple of hours..

607
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:09,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...before I get completely dehydrated and starve to death.

608
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:10,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's that?

609
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad?        Not a sound.

610
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You scared the cuss out of us!

611
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A lot of good animals are probably gonna die...

612
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:38,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...because of you.

613
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:43,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've been digging in circles for three days.

614
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:45,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Half the woods have been obliterated. Nobody can get out.

615
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:48,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right now my wife's huddled at the bottom of the flint-mine...

616
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:52,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with no food, no water, and twenty seven starving animal brats!

617
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:54,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just want to see a little...

618
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...sunshine.

619
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you're nocturnal, Phil.

620
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your eyes barely even open, on a good day.

621
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:02,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sick of your double-talk. We have rights!

622
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:04,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't like you, and we hate your dad.

623
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:07,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now grab some of that mud, chew it in your mouth, and swallow it.

624
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not gonna eat mud!        Cuss, yeah, you are.

625
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:18,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't do that.

626
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:21,049
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why'd you take your shoes off?

627
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:23,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I don't break your nose when I kick it.

628
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:34,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can fight my own fights.

629
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:37,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, you can't.

630
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:39,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Those farmers aren't gonna quit...

631
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:41,209
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...until they've got you and every member of your family...

632
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:44,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...nailed upside-down to a bloody stick with your eyes gorged out.

633
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:47,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is getting a little too personal.

634
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give me a minute.

635
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:07,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've got an idea.

636
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:08,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is it?        It could be a good one.

637
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lay it on us.        It might save our lives.

638
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Say the idea!

639
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:14,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alright! Let's try it!

640
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:19,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go to the flint-mine. Tell Mrs. Badger, et al. that help is on the way.

641
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:20,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is help on the way?

642
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I sure as cuss hope so.

643
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:32,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ash, I know what it's like to feel...

644
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...different.

645
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:39,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not different, am I?

646
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We all are.

647
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:42,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Him, especially.

648
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:46,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But there's something kind of fantastic about that, isn't there?

649
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:55,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not to me. I'd prefer to be an athlete.

650
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:01,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gentlemen, this time we must dig in a very special direction.

651
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:09,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got to kind of feel out the vibe.

652
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Begin.

653
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:23,880


654
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on!

655
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:52,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hit it slap in the middle! Do you get how incredible this is?

656
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:58,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}About a handsome little fox, Let me sing you folks a yarn.

657
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:07,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was a splendid little feller, Full of wit 'n' grace 'n' charm.

658
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:16,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, like any little critter needing Vittels for his littl'uns.

659
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:22,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, he stole, and he cheated, And he lied to survive.

660
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:37,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me take a little tick now To color in the scene,

661
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:42,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Across the valley lived three yokels Name of Boggis, Bunce, and Bean.

662
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:44,749
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now these three crazy jackies had our hero on the run

663
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,869
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shot the tail off the cuss With a fox-shooting gun.

664
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:48,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But that stylish little fox Was as clever as a whip.

665
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:52,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dug as quick as a gopher Who was a hyper-ack-a-tive.

666
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:59,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now those three farmers sit It where there's a hole, it was once a hill.

667
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:07,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And as far as I can reckon They're a-setting up there still.

668
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:12,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you singing, Petey?

669
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just... just making up one as I went along, really.

670
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's just weak song-writing!

671
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wrote a bad song, Petey!

672
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:30,260


673
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:42,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We took everything.

674
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:44,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They took everything?

675
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:47,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me call you back, Petey.

676
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:53,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, they'd be anywhere by now.        They're digging right under our feet.

677
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,639
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, in a sense, we've only made matters worse.

678
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:55,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We should have stayed out of it.

679
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've got an idea.

680
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:41,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm still not getting a signal. Is anybody getting any reception?

681
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't have any signal, but I've got a problem.

682
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:46,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Crisp up those ducks. Aye, drag those chickens.

683
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,119
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Slow them down just a little bit, we're a little ahead.

684
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are the apples? Still out? You still have them raw?

685
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:51,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, slice them up. Let's get them in the pantry.

686
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:56,079
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can imagine how painful, even just emotionally, that must be for you.

687
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, you know, it's not the end of the world.

688
00:45:57,620 --> 00:46:01,619
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, but Foxy, how humiliating! Having your whole tail blown clean off...

689
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:02,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can we drop it?

690
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:08,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, it's really good. Sweet and nice.

691
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:11,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, they say you're a natural. True or false?

692
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:13,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just...        Answer the question.

693
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:15,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}True, I guess        Correct.

694
00:46:15,590 --> 00:46:18,089
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get out of here, Agnes. I need to have a private word with Kristofferson.

695
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:21,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just a minute. She doesn't...        I don't mind. I'm gonna go talk to them.

696
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:24,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen to me, I just had a brainstorm for something...

697
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:27,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...fantastic I've got to do. But I can't do it alone.

698
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:29,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not interested.        Hear me out.

699
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:29,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, thanks.

700
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:32,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think foxes from your side of the family take unnecessary risks.

701
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:35,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Only because they got the guts in their blood...

702
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:36,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and so do we.

703
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:39,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Was I a bit rude to Agnes?        Yeah.

704
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:42,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd probably say something I shouldn't. I'll say something to her in a minute.

705
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:46,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's the brainstorm?        In a nutshell?

706
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're gonna steal back my dad's tail.

707
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:02,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, chief.        Here we go.

708
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:10,100


709
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:19,079
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, it took a near catastrophe for all of you to finally...

710
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:21,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...take me up on my offer to have you over to the flint-mine for dinner.

711
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:23,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I guess we have...        I'm sorry.

712
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:24,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe my invitation got lost in the mail.

713
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:26,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Does anybody know what this badger's talking about?

714
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:28,959
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, hold on.

715
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But Clive's right. In all seriousness.

716
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:31,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me, B.

717
00:47:32,270 --> 00:47:36,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess we do have these three ugly farmers to thank for one thing:

718
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:39,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...reminding us to be thankful and aware of each other.

719
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna say it again. Aware.

720
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:58,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't feel safe.        That's because we're not.

721
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:01,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should probably put on your bandit hat now.

722
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:04,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Personally, I don't have one, but I modified this tube sock.

723
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:09,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We look good.        Yeah, we do.

724
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:11,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now where would you keep a prized tail,

725
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:13,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if you collected them, if that was your hobby?

726
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:15,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd probably hang it over the mantelpiece.

727
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:18,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right. Good. In fact... what's that smell?

728
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:25,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ever tasted one of Mrs. Bean's famous nutmeg-ginger-apple-snaps?

729
00:48:25,730 --> 00:48:28,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I didn't do.

730
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:36,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They are still warm.

731
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:42,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got it wrong.        What?

732
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:44,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not over the mantelpiece...

733
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:46,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The necktie.

734
00:49:13,690 --> 00:49:16,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go. What?        Hang on. I wanna do more.

735
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:17,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's there!        She can't see.

736
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:27,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at each other. Here we are. Wow!

737
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:30,579
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now I've already had too much to drink, and I'm feeling sentimental,

738
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:33,329
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I'm gonna say something, anyway, which nobody wants to admit,

739
00:49:33,330 --> 00:49:34,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but I think is probably true.

740
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:37,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We beat them.

741
00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:40,309
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We beat those farmers, and now we're triumphantly eating

742
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:42,199
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...their roasted chicken, their sizzling duck,

743
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...their succulent turkey, their foie gras de...

744
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:48,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where did the boys go?        What? Where?

745
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ash? Kristofferson?        Boys?

746
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:54,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my God! That was crazy! I can't believe what just happened in there.

747
00:49:54,850 --> 00:49:55,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, let's go out of here! Let's go!

748
00:49:56,090 --> 00:49:58,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are we? Where are we? Where are we? What?

749
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:02,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kristofferson?

750
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:04,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What am I hearing again, baby? What's happening?

751
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:06,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Am I still paranoid?

752
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cider?

753
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:35,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What just happened?

754
00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:37,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something with cider. That was dangerous.

755
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:39,099
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is anyone hurt?        We're all hurt!

756
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:41,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My entire flint-mine just got demolished.

757
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,889
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Apple juice. Apple juice flood.

758
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:45,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's do a head-count! Everybody pick a buddy!

759
00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:46,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where did the boys go?

760
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:48,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ash?        Ash?

761
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:49,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kristofferson? Ash!?

762
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:50,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm here!

763
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:52,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ash! Who's your buddy?

764
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,549
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kristofferson.        Where is he?

765
00:50:54,550 --> 00:50:55,479
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know.        Why not?

766
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:57,239
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I lost him!        You lost him?

767
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:59,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I, uh, I was in the kitchen...        Where were you?

768
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:02,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We were trying to find the necktie.        What are you talking about?

769
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:04,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's my fault.        Oh, no.

770
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:07,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where did you get that nutmeg-ginger-apple-snap?

771
00:51:07,290 --> 00:51:09,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And why are you wearing that fake bandit hat!?

772
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:11,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We went to steal back your tail.

773
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:20,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kristofferson! Kristofferson!        Kristofferson! Kristofferson!

774
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,299
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wrap this wet, little mutt in a newspaper...

775
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:28,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and put him in a box with some holes punched in the top.

776
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:32,829
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's only one way out of this sewer, but the manhole cover's closed,

777
00:51:32,830 --> 00:51:34,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and there's a station wagon parked on it.

778
00:51:34,570 --> 00:51:36,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Which means we're permanently stuck down here.

779
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:40,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You still think we beat them, Foxy?

780
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:00,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Badger's right.

781
00:52:00,610 --> 00:52:02,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These farmers aren't gonna quit until they catch me.

782
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I shouldn't have lied to your face.

783
00:52:04,810 --> 00:52:06,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I shouldn't have fallen off the wagon...

784
00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:08,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and started secretly stealing chickens on the sly.

785
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:12,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I shouldn't have pushed these farmers so far and tried to embarrass them

786
00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:13,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and cuss with their heads.

787
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I enjoyed it, but I shouldn't have done it.

788
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:16,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And now there's only one way out.

789
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:20,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe if I hand myself over and let them kill me,

790
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:22,079
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...stuff me, and hang me over their mantelpiece.

791
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll do no such thing.

792
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Darling, maybe they'll let everyone else live.

793
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:31,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, why did you have to get us into this, Foxy?

794
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:35,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know, but I have a possible theory.

795
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:38,789
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think I have this thing where I need everybody to think...

796
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:41,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm the greatest... the quote-unquote fantastic Mr. Fox.

797
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:44,499
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And if they aren't completely knocked-out and dazzled,

798
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and kind of intimidated by me, then...

799
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:47,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't feel good about myself.

800
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:52,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Foxes traditionally like to court danger, hunt prey,

801
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:54,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and outsmart predators. And that's what I'm actually good at!

802
00:52:56,310 --> 00:52:58,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think, at the end of the day, I'm just...

803
00:52:58,110 --> 00:52:58,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know.

804
00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:00,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're wild animals.

805
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:04,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess we always were.

806
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:08,219
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I promise you, if I had all this to do over again,

807
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:09,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd have never let you down.

808
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was always more fun when we did it together, anyway.

809
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:17,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love you, Felicity.        I love you, too.

810
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:21,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I shouldn't have married you.

811
00:53:31,690 --> 00:53:34,269
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did I ever tell you about the time I learned we were gonna have a cub?

812
00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:35,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In the fox-trap.        Right.

813
00:53:35,770 --> 00:53:37,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We were at gunpoint, and your mother...        said she's pregnant.

814
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:38,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me tell it, okay?

815
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:42,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I had no idea how we were gonna get out of this jam, and...

816
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:45,459
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...then it hit me: what do foxes do better than any other animal?

817
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:46,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dig.        You're stepping on my lines.

818
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:47,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right, keep telling it.

819
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:50,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So we dug. And the whole time I put paw over paw,

820
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:54,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...scooping dirt and pebbles with your mother digging like crazy beside me,

821
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:57,019
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I kept wondering: who is this little boy gonna be?

822
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:58,379
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or girl.        Or girl, right.

823
00:53:58,380 --> 00:53:59,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because at that point we didn't know.

824
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:03,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ash, I'm so glad he was you.

825
00:54:05,790 --> 00:54:07,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not your fault... it's mine.

826
00:54:30,650 --> 00:54:31,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Goodbye.

827
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:38,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I guess we should, uh...

828
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:41,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...probably split into a certain number of groups...

829
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:43,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and start doing something, right?

830
00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:52,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I have a glass of water?

831
00:54:56,370 --> 00:54:58,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me! Excuse me?

832
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:01,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kristofferson? Hello?

833
00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:03,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you hear us?

834
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:05,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kristofferson?

835
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:07,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They got the boy.

836
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:15,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They want to trade the son for his poppa.

837
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:22,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why'd they write this in letters cut out of magazines?

838
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:24,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To protect their identities.

839
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, right, but then why did they sign their names?

840
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Plus, we already knew who they were because they're trying to kill us.

841
00:55:30,490 --> 00:55:32,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Fox, we have your son.

842
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:34,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you ever want to see him alive again...

843
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:36,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You took the wrong fox.

844
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:40,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm his son.

845
00:55:42,670 --> 00:55:44,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can see the resemblance.

846
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:48,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's that?        Help!

847
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:08,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, man! Come on! stop!

848
00:56:16,390 --> 00:56:17,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at you, girl!

849
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:21,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're still as fine looking as a creme brulee.

850
00:56:23,070 --> 00:56:26,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Am I being flirted with by a psychotic rat?

851
00:56:36,650 --> 00:56:39,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me, may I cut-in?

852
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:16,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The boy is locked in an apple crate on top of a gun locker...

853
00:57:16,710 --> 00:57:19,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...in the attic of Bean Annex.

854
00:57:21,550 --> 00:57:23,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Would you have told me if I didn't kill you first?

855
00:57:25,230 --> 00:57:26,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Never.

856
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:28,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All these wasted years.

857
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What were you looking for, Rat?

858
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's trying to say something, Dad.

859
00:57:36,470 --> 00:57:37,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cider.

860
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here you are, Rat.

861
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:48,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A beaker of Bean's finest secret cider.

862
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:55,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like melted gold.

863
00:58:04,470 --> 00:58:05,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He redeemed himself.

864
00:58:06,630 --> 00:58:08,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Redemption? Sure.

865
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, in the end he's just another dead rat...

866
00:58:11,370 --> 00:58:14,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...in a garbage pail behind a Chinese restaurant.

867
00:58:29,090 --> 00:58:30,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He might been mindless

868
00:58:31,410 --> 00:58:32,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, he did.

869
00:58:34,270 --> 00:58:35,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My suicide mission's been canceled.

870
00:58:35,870 --> 00:58:38,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're replacing it with a go-for-broke rescue mission.

871
00:58:38,310 --> 00:58:40,340


872
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:43,159
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In a way, I'm almost glad that flood interrupted us,

873
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:44,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...because I don't like the toast I was giving.

874
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:46,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna start over.

875
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:54,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When I look down this table with the exquisite feast set before us,

876
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:57,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I see, two terrific lawyers, a skilled pediatrician,

877
00:58:57,820 --> 00:58:59,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...a wonderful chef, a savvy real estate agent,

878
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:03,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...an excellent tailor, a crack accountant, a gifted musician,

879
00:59:03,050 --> 00:59:04,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...a pretty good minnow fisherman, and possibly...

880
00:59:04,910 --> 00:59:07,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...the best landscape painter working on the scene today.

881
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:10,999
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe a few of you might even read my column from time to time.

882
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who knows? I tend to doubt it.

883
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:16,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I also see a room full of wild animals.

884
00:59:17,690 --> 00:59:21,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wild animals with true natures and pure talents.

885
00:59:21,630 --> 00:59:24,009
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wild animals with scientific sounding Latin names...

886
00:59:24,010 --> 00:59:25,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...that means something about our D.N.A.

887
00:59:26,010 --> 00:59:30,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wild animals each with his own strengths and weaknesses due to his or her species.

888
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:36,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anyway, I think it may very well be all the beautiful differences among us

889
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:39,639
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that just might give us the tiniest glimmer of a chance of saving my nephew

890
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:43,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and letting me make it up to you for getting us into this crazy whatever-it-is.

891
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:47,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. It's just a thought. Thank you for listening.

892
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:48,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cheers, everyone.

893
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:52,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's eat!

894
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:58,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? I was just playing along with the pitch he was doing.

895
00:59:59,510 --> 01:00:00,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will you join me?

896
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:03,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I will.

01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I did say it! I wrote it on your paw!

998
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:18,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, it's written...

999
01:07:18,890 --> 01:07:20,250


1000
01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:24,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's that white stuff around his mouth?

1001
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:25,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think he eats soap.

1002
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:29,870


1003
01:07:30,930 --> 01:07:32,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not soap.

1004
01:07:32,370 --> 01:07:35,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, then why does he have that bubbly...        He's rabid. With rabies.

1005
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:37,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've heard about this beagle.

1006
01:07:39,950 --> 01:07:41,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You two go ahead while I distract him.

1007
01:07:50,330 --> 01:07:51,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who? Huh! What!?

1008
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:04,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can fit through there.        Hm?

1009
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:06,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wanna know why?

1010
01:08:07,070 --> 01:08:07,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why?

1011
01:08:08,630 --> 01:08:09,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because I'm little.

1012
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:12,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give me that shoelace.

1013
01:08:22,410 --> 01:08:24,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's me. I'm rescuing you.

1014
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:30,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've got mixed feelings about that.        I don't blame you.

1015
01:08:33,940 --> 01:08:36,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you give me a karate lesson real quick?

1016
01:08:37,830 --> 01:08:39,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Stand like this.

1017
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:43,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Position yourself on the balls of your feet. Close your eyes.

1018
01:08:43,860 --> 01:08:45,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You weigh less than a slice of bread.

1019
01:08:48,170 --> 01:08:50,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I feel like there's a tenderness in your eyes, isn't there?

1020
01:08:51,450 --> 01:08:52,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, I'm right.

1021
01:08:53,210 --> 01:08:55,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's review the principle of ... techniques:

1022
01:08:55,410 --> 01:08:57,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...jumping, flipping, landing.

1023
01:08:57,940 --> 01:09:00,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're a good boy. A little lonely, maybe, but...

1024
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:02,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...terribly sweet.

1025
01:09:02,740 --> 01:09:05,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is your name Spitz? That's German, isn't it?

1026
01:09:06,570 --> 01:09:09,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now for a rudimentary version of the cyclone chop.

1027
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:12,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}First, you need to get a running start, which obviously, I can't do in here,

1028
01:09:12,220 --> 01:09:13,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...then, as you arrive at the destination of the chop...

1029
01:09:14,050 --> 01:09:15,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...lean and thrust into the point of contact,

1030
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:18,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...paw remains open and straight, then withdraw instantaneously.

1031
01:09:18,150 --> 01:09:19,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember, it's the pull back that matters.

1032
01:09:19,890 --> 01:09:22,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The pull back generates the force of the impact.

1033
01:09:23,050 --> 01:09:23,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Got it.

1034
01:09:26,030 --> 01:09:28,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I'm just gonna chop this thing right off.

1035
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:39,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's gonna do it!

1036
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:45,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why, you're just as sweet as...

1037
01:09:47,270 --> 01:09:49,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought he said: never look a beagle in the eye.

1038
01:10:00,730 --> 01:10:01,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did... Did you chop it?

1039
01:10:02,580 --> 01:10:03,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no! No! No!

1040
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:20,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kristofferson? Kristofferson!

1041
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm okay.

1042
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:24,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm okay.

1043
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:28,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.        That's alright.

1044
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:30,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were just trying to unlock the apple crate.

1045
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:33,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I mean, I'm sorry about...

1046
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:35,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, you mean from before.

1047
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:37,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The apology you owed me which you never actually said.

1048
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:40,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right. I'm grumpy.

1049
01:10:40,870 --> 01:10:43,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I spit. I wake up on the wrong side of the bed.

1050
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:44,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just...

1051
01:10:44,910 --> 01:10:46,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...different, apparently.

1052
01:10:47,030 --> 01:10:49,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But... it won't happen again.

1053
01:10:50,620 --> 01:10:52,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kristofferson, I'm sorry.

1054
01:10:54,890 --> 01:10:56,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's alright, too.

1055
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:58,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Throw me the shoelace, please.

1056
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:11,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you okay?

1057
01:11:44,380 --> 01:11:45,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's wearing it.

1058
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:54,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your tractors uprooted my tree. Your posse hunted my family.

1059
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:59,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your gunmen kidnapped my nephew. Your rat insulted my wife...

1060
01:11:59,850 --> 01:12:02,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and you shot off my tail.

1061
01:12:02,670 --> 01:12:05,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not leaving here without that neck tie.

1062
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:07,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kill him!

1063
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:18,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Actually, we should just go.

1064
01:12:18,940 --> 01:12:19,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where did I park?

1065
01:12:20,150 --> 01:12:21,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I weigh less than a slice of bread.

1066
01:12:22,630 --> 01:12:24,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?        I'll be right back.

1067
01:12:24,490 --> 01:12:25,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ash!?

1068
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:35,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dodge the grabbers, duck the taggers,

01:12:35,830 --> 01:12:37,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...jump the twig basket and...

1070
01:12:37,570 --> 01:12:39,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...knock the cedar-stick off the cross-rock.

1071
01:12:58,290 --> 01:12:59,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hot box!\nHot box!

1072

01:14:14,460 --> 01:14:17,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just intercepted a high frequency radio signal with the can.

1099
01:14:17,330 --> 01:14:18,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I think they're on their way home!

1100
01:14:27,980 --> 01:14:30,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't turn around.        What?

1101
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:40,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where did he come from?

1102
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where did you come from?

1103
01:14:46,070 --> 01:14:47,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing here?

1104
01:14:49,470 --> 01:14:50,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Canis lupus!

1105
01:14:51,930 --> 01:14:53,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Vulpes Vulpes!

1106
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:57,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think he speaks English or Latin.

1107
01:14:58,810 --> 01:15:00,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pensez-vous que I'hiver sera rude?

1108
01:15:02,210 --> 01:15:04,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm asking if he thinks we're in for a hard winter.

1109
01:15:08,770 --> 01:15:09,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He doesn't seem to know.

1110
01:15:12,940 --> 01:15:14,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have a phobia of wolves!

1111
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:32,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What a beautiful creature.

1112
01:15:33,540 --> 01:15:34,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wish him luck, boys.

1113
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:36,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good luck.        Good luck out there.

1114
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:57,550


1115
01:15:59,450 --> 01:16:02,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These three, in this reporter's opinion, obsessed farmers...

1116
01:16:02,470 --> 01:16:05,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...remain convinced the fox in question will eventually reappear.

1117
01:16:06,390 --> 01:16:06,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why?

1118
01:16:07,430 --> 01:16:09,249
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because foxes aren't meant to live in a sewer.

1119
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:11,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're refugees.        All they have to eat down there is...

1120
01:16:11,670 --> 01:16:12,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Trash!

1121
01:16:13,140 --> 01:16:14,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And not much of it.

1122
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:17,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you, farmers.

1123
01:16:17,630 --> 01:16:20,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For Action Twelve, this is Dan Peabody.

1124
01:16:22,990 --> 01:16:25,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are we looking at?        It's just his tonsils. They're little swelled.

1125
01:16:25,810 --> 01:16:27,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, is it serious?        No, hopefully, he wants to lose them.

1126
01:16:28,110 --> 01:16:29,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lose the tonsils?        Let's...

1127
01:16:30,150 --> 01:16:34,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm hungry.        Well, have some water. Here.

1128
01:16:35,660 --> 01:16:36,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I like walking.

1129
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:53,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My darlings?

1130
01:16:56,180 --> 01:16:57,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are we going?        Nobody knows.

1131
01:16:57,750 --> 01:16:59,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We were in the middle of a meditation practice.

1132
01:16:59,460 --> 01:17:00,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Watch your step.

1133
01:17:00,790 --> 01:17:02,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's see, now. Where does this lead?

1134
01:17:02,670 --> 01:17:06,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no, Foxy. It's filthy.        Keep a good grip, everyone.

1135
01:17:06,350 --> 01:17:08,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This better be worth it.        I think I see...

1136
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:11,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...a little sliver of light. What's this?

1137
01:17:11,890 --> 01:17:14,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is it a door?        You're a terrible actor, Foxy.

1138
01:17:14,710 --> 01:17:17,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you smell something? Is that... freon?

1139
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:19,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna crack open this trap door...

1140
01:17:19,790 --> 01:17:21,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and see if something's on the other side.

1141
01:17:21,530 --> 01:17:24,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I highly doubt it, though. There's probably just more sewer.

1142
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:27,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, wouldn't it be surprising if        Open it.

1143
01:17:34,870 --> 01:17:36,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, look! There's a whole, enormous, glorious,

1144
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:38,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...gigantic supermarket up here!

1145
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:41,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And they close early on weekends.

1146
01:17:45,530 --> 01:17:49,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You really are kind of a quote-unquote fantastic fox.

1147
01:17:50,060 --> 01:17:50,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I try.

1148
01:17:51,390 --> 01:17:53,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get enough to share with everybody, and remember...

1149
01:17:53,350 --> 01:17:56,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...the Rabbits are vegetarians, and Badger's supposedly can't eat walnuts.

1150
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:02,339
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess now that Kristofferson's dad's already down to single pneumonia...

1151
01:18:02,340 --> 01:18:04,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and getting better, he'll be going home soon, huh?

1152
01:18:04,450 --> 01:18:06,699
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Actually, when he spoke to me from the hospital, he said...

1153
01:18:06,700 --> 01:18:09,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...he was already talking to Weasel about real estate availabilities

1154
01:18:09,150 --> 01:18:10,619
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...down in our sewer system.

1155
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:12,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, really? Well, now's the time to buy.

1156
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:23,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, I get it. Is that your trademark?

1157
01:18:26,830 --> 01:18:28,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm pregnant again.

1158
01:18:29,530 --> 01:18:30,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow!

1159
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:34,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think we're both glowing.

1160
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:39,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do another toast, Dad.

1161
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:43,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Let's see.

1162
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:46,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Right. Okay!

1163
01:18:50,610 --> 01:18:54,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They say all foxes are slightly allergic to linoleum.

1164
01:18:54,410 --> 01:18:55,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But it's cool to the paw.

1165
01:18:55,820 --> 01:18:56,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Try it.

1166
01:18:59,820 --> 01:19:02,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They say my tail needs to be dry cleaned twice a month...

1167
01:19:03,310 --> 01:19:05,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but now it's fully detachable. See?

1168
01:19:06,730 --> 01:19:09,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They say our tree may never grow back.

1169
01:19:10,070 --> 01:19:11,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, one day, something will.

1170
01:19:13,150 --> 01:19:15,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, these crackles are made out of synthetic goose,

1171
01:19:15,630 --> 01:19:18,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and these Giblets come from artificial squab.

1172
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:19,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And even these apples look fake...

1173
01:19:20,210 --> 01:19:21,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but at least they've got stars on them.

1174
01:19:23,530 --> 01:19:24,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess my point is...

1175
01:19:25,390 --> 01:19:27,689
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we'll eat tonight, and we'll eat together,

1176
01:19:27,690 --> 01:19:30,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and even in this not particularly flattering light,

1177
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:34,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...you are without a doubt, the five-and-a-half...

1178
01:19:35,050 --> 01:19:37,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...most wonderful wild animals I've ever met...

1179
01:19:38,070 --> 01:19:39,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...in my life.

1180
01:19:40,370 --> 01:19:42,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So let's raise our boxes.

1181
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:45,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To our...

1182
01:19:47,130 --> 01:19:48,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...survival!

1183
01:19:54,660 --> 01:19:55,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How was that?

1184
01:19:57,510 --> 01:19:59,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was a good toast.

1185
01:20:01,230 --> 01:20:12,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}亲，有空的时候可以来交流电影哦 加我QQ：274796078

1186
01:20:14,940 --> 01:20:18,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well there she goes with a brand new love affair

1187
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:21,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dancing with him like she don't even care

1188
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:27,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well let her dance with him, let her dance all night long

1189
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well who would've known that just yesterday

1190
01:20:36,230 --> 01:20:38,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She danced with me the very same way

1191
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:44,270
Well let her dance with him, let her dance all night long
