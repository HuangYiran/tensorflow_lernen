Yeah, I understand, man. Your new apartment, new car, new girlfriend.

809

你根本不瞭解我的處境.
You have no idea what I'm deaiing with.

810
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:08,530

阿哈.好的,我知道了
Uh-huh. Yeah, I understand that.

815

懷亞特不得不考慮我們的提議.他沒的選
Wyatt has to consider our offer. He has no choice.

816

沒有錢包,沒有鑰匙.
No wallet, no keys.

It'll know where you've been, who you've been with.

It will know who you are. And it's aii ours.

You think people really want all that personal information

It's not the roof that matters, Adam.

這是一種在家的溫暖感覺.
It's the warm fuzzy feeling of the home under it.

857

你好,艾登
Hello, again, Adam.

嗯. Ethion進展順利. Occura專案如何?
Mm. Ethion's fine. How's Occura?

01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:50,003
一切正常.
Right on schedule.
