1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,790
Been slow the last few weeks.

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,590
Previously on chicago fire.

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:11,090
Come up short again,and you'll be serving beer out of a tent.

4
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:14,240
If arthur finds out i'm a cop,then i'm a dead cop.

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,660
Can i come back to the firehouse?

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:17,930
Anytime you want.

7
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,900
Maybe there's a way to get her into a minimumsecurity facility.

8
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,040
Let me make some calls.

9
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,070
I have some friends at thestate's attorney's office.

10
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:28,380
The official randall mcholland for union president campaign poster.

11
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,380
We're taking sullivan down.

12
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,680
Why don't we clear the air,shay?

13
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,800
There's nothing to talk about.

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,360
Well,there is if you'restill pissed at me.

15
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,670
How'd you get mixed upwith these gossipy bitches?

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,520
The state believes thatfirehouse 51 is worth saving.

17
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,560
It's your leadershipthat we're unhappy with.

18
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,720
I'll do whatever it takes to save 51.

19
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,260
My resignation.

20
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,030
I'm taking over 51.

21
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,440
This thing's broke.

22
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,600
What?That's not helping.

23
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,810
What's going on?

24
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:13,620
Someone doesn't know how to make coffee.

25
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,210
Guys,does anybody have any advil on them?

26
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:19,110
Man,you got to have something betterThan munter's brown roast.

27
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,980
- Yeah,we got starbucks.
- Where?

28
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:24,880
About two blocks down on the north side of the street.

29
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,540
I'm going running.

30
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:42,270
- Kelly?
- Yeah?

31
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,270
I don't know if you remember.

32
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,150
I'm beth.Benny's wife.

33
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:48,940
Yeah.Yeah,of course.

34
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,430
I know benny's been hanging out with you.

35
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:55,440
And he won't return my phone calls.

36
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,560
The boys miss him.

37
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,060
They need to see their father.

38
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,100
I'm a little confused.

39
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,100
He told me he was going backto kenosha every weekend.

40
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,140
He hasn't been home in months.

41
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:11,140
Look,i'm sorry to dump all this on you.

42
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,010
No,it's. It's. It's.

43
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:16,150
I'll. I'll talk to him.

44
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,580
Thank you.

45
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,640
chief.It's kelly.

46
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,040
Listen,i got to stop byo.f.i. And see my old man.

47
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,920
I might be a few minutes late to shift.

48
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,720
Anyway,i'll explain everything to you when i get there.

49
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,190
I'm sorry about this.Have clarke cover for me.

50
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,340
Thanks.

51
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,170
Right.So i will needyour signature just here

52
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:13,710
and one more just here.

53
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,440
I need to be assured thatthis means that 51 is safe.

54
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,460
Yes,it does.

55
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,100
Okay.

56
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,270
You're doing the right thing,chief.

57
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:39,270
Now,i figure it'll take a few weeks to put it all together.

58
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,420
I understand.

59
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,820
In the meantime,i would appreciate it

60
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:45,210
If you would help us make this transition asefficient as possible.

61
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,990
I'll help any way i can.

62
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,630
You're gonna walk awaywith a very nice pension.

63
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,560
What.

64
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,450

- Buddy.What's your name?
- Nathan.

69
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,090
Nathan,i need you to close your eyes and cover your face.

70
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:12,450
Can you do that for me?

71
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,770
You can open your eyes now,nathan.

72
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,710
Can you wiggle your toes?

73
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:25,610
- I think so,yeah.
- Good,good,good.

74
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:26,700
But my arm.

75
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,020
Listen,just stay tough for me,okay?

76
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,750
All right,hold on.I'mgonna get you out of here.

77
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,020
Come on.Good girl.

78
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,170
Good morning,lieutenant.

79
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,660
That was lasky down at headquarters.

80
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,230
It looks like mcleod ismaking her final decision today

81
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,770
aboutWhich house she's gonna close next.

82
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:42,610
And?

83
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:45,140
He thinks it's between us and firehouse 17.

84
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,680
Man.

85
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:49,420
This has got to be weighingpretty heavy on the chief.

86
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,540
I just wanted to remind everyone,

87
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:53,240
Today is election dayfor the union presidency.

88
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,750
Polls will be open allevening starting at 5:00 p.m.,

89
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,110
So i urge you all toexercise your right to vote,

90
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,890
Unless you plan onvoting for greg sullivan,

91
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,580
In which case,forget what i just said.

92
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:09,700
Listen,otis and i havebeen going over this and going over this,

93
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,640
And we think that weneed to involve the cops at this point,

94
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,580
You know,in an official capacity.

95
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,750
I told you guys i'd take care of it.Antonio is.

96
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,330
Okay,no offense,But i feel like

97
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:20,120
we need to gobeyond antonio at this point.

98
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,220
Reach out to the higherups,get somebody with a little bit more juice.

99
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,310
I think maybe you guys just might be overreacting a tiny bit.

100
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,650
If we just stick to theplan and pay what he wants.

101
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,400
Overreacting?

102
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,800
Did you have something in your eye,

103
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,210
Or did you see game dayexplode into smithereens?

104
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:36,810
Listen,if arthur's willingto go that far with them,

105
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:40,040
You don't think he woulddo the same to molly's?

106
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,470
Has anyone seen severide?

107
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:42,710
- No.
- nope.

108
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:45,200
So messed up.I had to take the bus here.

109
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,070
One,two,three.

110
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,340
- I can't!I can't.
- Pull!

111
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,370
Stop! Stop!My leg!I can't!

112
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:54,280
Okay. Okay,okay.

113
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,490
All right.

114
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,580
All right,okay.

115
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,960
Let's take a look at this arm.

116
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:06,970
Nathan,i'm not gonnabe able to get you out

117
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,740
Unless i try and pull this out.

118
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,410
It's gonna be just likeripping a bandaid off,okay?

119
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:13,480
It's gonna hurt at first,andthen it'll feel much better.

120
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,130
Ready?

121
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,270
All right.Okay.

122
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,810
Damn it. Damn it.

123
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:28,380
I think the rebar nickedan artery in your arm.

124
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,330
Listen,bud,i got to do something to get this bleeding under control.

125
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:32,650
You got to stay tough for me,okay?

126
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,870
I gotta pinch off this artery.

127
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:42,620
Okay.I. I got it.All right,there we go.

128
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,640
It's done. It's done. It's done.

129
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,810
There we go.

130
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:51,740
Help! Somebody help us!

131
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,250

- Okay,okay.

134
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,970
I was just trying to be supportive.

135
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:05,020
I know.I'm just.I'm nervous about this debate.

136
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,930
There's not,like,a chance that moreThan five people

137
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,260
are ever gonna hear this thing.

138
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,790
I'll have you know thatmore than 600 firefighters

139
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,430

140
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:15,380
That is the biggest audience i've ever had.

141
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,450
Okay.Hey,that's great.

142
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:20,980

- Be better than yourself.

143
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,590
- yeah

144
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,430
Let's hear it.

145
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:28,300
I just found out a little something interesting about sullivan.

146
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,530
His exwife is taking him to family court

147
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:33,880
For failure to pay his child support.

148
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:35,670
And it isn't the first time.

149
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:37,070
Are you serious?

150
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,430
We got to hit him with this hard,randy.

151
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:41,480
Yeah,i don't know.

00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,330
Randy,i know you're all about maintaining your integrity

153
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,120
Throughoutthis process,but trust me,

154
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,380
We've got to hit himwith everything we've got.

155
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:52,270
She's got a point,buddy.

156
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:06,450
- Yeah?

157
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,540
How can i help you?

158
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:11,030
I need to have a word witha few of your firefighters.

159
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,990
What about?

160
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:16,470
Wait.So you're sayingwe're suspects in this?

161
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,320
- Unbelievable.
- Is it?

162
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,870
An old bar goes up in flames,

163
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,920
You three buy the placeat a great discount,

164
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,240
I'm sure,fix it up.

165
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,590
Then game day comes along.

166
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,430
Suddenly,business ain't so good.

167
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:27,930
They call the cops on you.

168
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,480
You call the fire marshal on them.

169
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,440
That's what we call an escalation.From there.

170
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,690
Did we have a professional rivalry with game day?Absolutely.

171
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:38,030
But would we ever consider in a million years torching the place?

172
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,630
Absolutely not!

173
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,700
We're good "salt of the earth" people.You ask anyone.

174
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,330
Okay. Just wanted to let you know where we stand.

175
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:47,990
I'll come back withsome followup questions if i have any.

176
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:54,440
clarke,have you seen severide?

177
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,710
Chief said he had some familybusiness and to cover for him.

178
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,370
So i talked to my friend.

179
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:08,170
He said he's reviewing heather darden's case personally.

180
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:10,720
He said minimum security'sa real possibility.

181
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,340
That's great.Thank you.

182
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,460
- No worries.
- All right.

183
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,070
Buddy.

184
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:19,850
Thanks for coming.Ready to do a shift?

185
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:21,550
Are you sure that's okay?

186
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,890
Are you kidding?We're lucky to have you.

187
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,600
Somebody blow the bells.

188
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,970
We got a v.i.p. Here.

189
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,870
Before you say anything,you're not suspects,okay?

190
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,800
No?'Cause someone forgot to tellthat to detective helling.

191
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,170
He thinks we burnt down the competition.

192
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:41,750
I'll make sure he's set straight.

193
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,830
- I'm on this,gabby.
- Yeah,tell that to game day.

194
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:46,460
I was with arthur when game day went up.

195
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,130
Now,whether he gavethat order ahead of time,i don't know.

196
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:50,550
I didn't see it.

197
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:54,180
We are so close here.

198
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:59,160
I just need him provoked.

199
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:01,900
What what are you asking?

200
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:06,460
The next time he comes to collect,tell him no dice.

201
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,980
What are you gonna do?

202
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,440
Just tell him no dice.

203
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:19,380
I hope you know what you're doing.

204
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,810
This is it.

205
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,640
- Is this where you sleep?
- Sometimes,yeah.

206
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,150
He's the lucky one.

207
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,070
I got to sleep outhere with the riffraff.

208
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:31,350
You should try catching acouple of winks next to mouch.

209
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:35,190
It's like the foghorns ofbar harbor all going off.

210
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,390
51,squad 3.

211
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:38,020
- Catch you later,kid.
- I gotta go.

212
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:41,630
We'll do something funwhen i get back,i promise.

213
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,980
Please,my wife!

214
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,560
You got to help her!

215
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,770
We just need you to back upso we can do our work,okay?

216
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,270
She's still alive.

217
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,930
She won't be for long if that steel moves.

218
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:19,650
It's like a house of cards.

219
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,890
The bike is the only thingstopping it from crushing her.

220
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:23,240
We got to stabilize this truck.

221
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,450
- Can't move an inch.
- Got it.

222
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:27,090
Mouch,chalk the wheels.Otis,kill the engine.

223
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:29,210
Capp,bring the jaws.Tony,i need some cribbing.

224
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,910
Herrmann,i need that other set of jaws.

225
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,520
On it!

226
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,830
let's take a look at you.Come on.

227
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,620
Okay,that should hold it in one piece.

228
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,630
Hop in,capp.Go nice and easy.

229
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,720
xxxxxxxxxxx

230
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:09,750
All right,now.Now! Now!

231
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,460
Slide.It's going,it's going!

232
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:20,510
Okay.On my count.One,two,three.

233
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,260
Right?

234
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:40,830
nathan,do.Do you got a phone?

235
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:42,900
It's in my backpack.

236
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,480
- Where?
- I put it down.

237
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,130
Listen,nathan,you'vebeen incredible so far.Okay?

238
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:55,240
Superhero.

239
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,360
But i got to ask you to dig just a little deeper,okay?

240
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,350
I need you to pinch thisartery tight yourself,just for a few seconds.

241
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:05,990
Okay,just think about it like you're holding a piece of spaghetti.

242
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,770
I use a fork for spaghetti.

243
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:11,000
Attaboy.Okay.

244
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,180
You got me there.Here,just use your hand.

245
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,910
Use your hand there.Yeah.xxxxxx

246
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:18,120
Pinch.There you go.Pinch that.

247
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,540
I know,i know,i know,i know.

248
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,010
- It hurts so bad.
- I know it does.

249
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:23,020
Just hold your hand asstill as possible,okay?

250
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,200
I'll be right back.

251
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,860
You're doing great.

252
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,010
You're doing great.

253
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:40,030
This is kellyseveride.Leave a message.

254
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:42,190
Kelly.Chief boden.

255
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:46,380
Just checking to see how much longer you think you're gonna be.

256
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,020
Probably gonna get a relief lieutenant here

257
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:52,410
If whatever you got going'sgonna take much longer,so just,uh.

258
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:54,310
Let me know.

259
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,040
Thanks.

260
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,630
How we doing,bud?

261
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:10,100
I don't know how muchlonger i can hold this.

262
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,370
Okay.Hold on.

263
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,040
Damn it.

264
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,100
- I'm sorry.
- No,no,no.You. You're doing great.

265
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,760
Hang in there.Stay tough for me.

266
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,020
There you are.

267
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,860
I was gonna show you how to dry the hoses.

268
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:44,030
Is someone else wearing my dad's coat now?

269
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,510
No.Nobody else is wearing it.

270
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:54,080
It was,it was damaged in the fire.

271
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,490
That's what i figured.

272
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,930
He's still a very big part of this house.

273
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:06,760
Yeah,everyone keeps saying that.

274
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,480
that was some quick thinking out there with the jaws,man.

275
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,250
Yeah,how'd you know to do that?

276
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,260
Had to improvise.

277
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,770
In iraq we were underequippedmost of the time,

278
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:22,230
So we had to make do with what we had.

279
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:24,150
Yeah,i.I read aboutsome of the "macguyvering"

280
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,060
You guys did to upgrade gear.

281
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:29,040
Last thing you want,get caught with your pants down.

282
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,530
I guess that's thereason i like what we do.

283
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:33,810
A firefighter needsthree things to survive.

284
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:36,800
Water,common sense,and balls.

285
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,070
Hello,there.

286
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:41,380
Greg sullivan.Appreciate your support.

287
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:44,660
Greg sullivan,running for union president.

288
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,160
Looking forward to your vote tonight.

289
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,960
Mr.sullivan.I'm isabella thompson.We spoke on the phone.

290
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,810
And aren't you even prettier in person?

291
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:56,840
If you'll follow me into the briefing room,we can get started.

292
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:00,880
Into the lion's den i go,huh?

293
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,670
Halstead's an undercover cop?

294
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:07,850
How long have you known about this?

295
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:10,610
Not long.And i'm.I'm sorrythat i didn't tell you guys.

296
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:13,400
It's just,he wantedme to protect his cover.

297
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,390
He needs us to provoke arthurso that he can make a case.

298
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:18,450
It's showtime.

299
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,710
Greg sullivan.

300
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:24,470
Next question goes to mr. Sullivan.

301
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:27,170
Mr. Sullivan,if elected union president,

302
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:30,380
What would you do to better the lives of the firefighters in this city?

303
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,920
Well,that's a great question,brian.I'm glad you asked it.

304
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,150
As your union president,

305
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:36,860
My first order of business would be to put an end

306
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:40,530
Tothe crippling interference by state officials anddo away with policies,

307
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,760
Like the mandatory wellness program.

308
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,870
That's actually a pretty good answer.

309
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:47,180
And on to you,mr. Mcholland.

310
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,190
I would have to say

311
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:54,100
That i am in agreementwith,uh,mr.sullivan here.

312
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:59,030
All right,um,i'm gonna throw a little curveball at you guys.

313
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:03,990
mr.Sullivan,um,if you could be any kind of animal,

314
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,570
Any kind at all,what would you be?

315
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:08,310
Well,i know what i wouldn't want to be.

316
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:11,220
I wouldn't want to be a mouch.

317
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,000
I'm. I'm sorry.

318
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,650
A mouch.You know,half man,half couch.

319
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:19,310
It's mr. Mcholland's nicknameat this firehouse,am i right?

320
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,430
I don't see how that's remotely.

321
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:23,840
I mean,you must admit that nickname does not inspire leadership.

322
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,740
In fact,it implies the opposite.

323
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,820
Laziness,slovenliness.

324
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,890
Do you care to respond to that,mouch?Mr.mcholland?

325
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:34,950
I don't feel the need to dignify mr. Sullivan's remarks

326
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,520
Except to say that the nickname

327
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,870
That he's referring tois a term of endearment given to me

328
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:43,870
By my coworkers out of friendship and respect.

329
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:47,510
Well,i guess that's to beexpected from firehouse 51.

330
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:48,690
Excuse me?

331
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:53,260
Well,isn't it true this firehouse has had its share of scandal in recent years?

332
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:57,230
Sexual harassment lawsuit,a questionable onduty death,

333
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:01,470
Not to mention the fostering of a serial arsonist within its ranks.

334
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,350
I don't know who you think you are,

335
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,520
Coming in here and badmouthing our house.

336
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,810
Just being honest.

337
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:09,830
Well,you want some honesty?

338
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:13,900
How about your own personal.

339
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,620
You know what?Never mind.

340
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:31,450
I've said what i need to say.

341
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,710
And we're out of time.

342
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,710
I'd like to thank our two candidates

343
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:45,830
And remind everyone that polls open promptly at 5:00 p.m.

344
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:50,150
We're gonna need an act of god now.

345
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:03,270
Help!Over here!

346
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,680
Nathan.Nathan,hey.

347
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,400
- You with me?
- Yeah.

348
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,240
Yeah?I need you to pinch thistight again for me,okay?

349
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,680
Come on,you can do this.

350
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,550
You got it.A little more.

351
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:17,530
There you go.I'll be.i'll be right back.

352
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:25,400
I need help!Help!

353
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,890
Over here.

354
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,040
Help!

355
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,350
Nathan!Nathan!

356
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,170
Wake up,buddy.

357
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,480
Wake up,buddy.You got to wake up.

358
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,880
Help!

359
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,100
Wallace.

360
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,170
Thanks for meeting me.

361
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,940
Have you told the house yet?

362
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,620
No,i have not.

363
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:44,220
I'm telling everyone next shift.

364
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,010
You want me to come by and introduce myself as the new chief after?

365
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:48,900
No.

366
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,680
I didn't campaign for your job,wally.

367
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,680
- No?
- No.

368
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,370
But i want my son to stay safe.

369
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:07,880
So,when it was offered to me,i took it.

370
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,190
I'm giving up my job to save 51.

371
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:13,110
I know.

372
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:16,780
And you've accomplished your mission.

373
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:20,240
They're closing 17.

374
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:57,300
Can i have your attention,please?

375
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,740
Word just came to me.

376
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:02,300
They're closing firehouse 17.

377
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,950
I don't mean to be insensitive,chief,

378
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:07,580
but does that mean we're safe?

379
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:10,190
I've been told we are.

380
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:22,200
Casey.

381
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:28,910
- Benny?
- I had no say over my replacement.

382
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:30,460
Yeah,but benny.

383
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:33,430
Will you please just waituntil i announce it next shift?

384
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:37,480
I don't need to disrupt the union vote.

385
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:40,060
It's.It's mouch's night.

386
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,280
I'll tell you what i do need.

387
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,600
For you to be a leader.

388
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,330
Now more than ever.

389
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:09,320
How we doing,nathan?You hanging in there?

390
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:13,950
- buddy,you still with me?
- I'm here.

391
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:16,850
Don't give up on me,okay?I want you to promise me.

392
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:19,040
I've seen guys a lot bigger anda lot stronger than you give up,

393
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,510
And once they do,you're done.You're gone.

394
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,590
There's nothing i can do for you.

395
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:25,080
So i want you to promise me,kid.

396
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,380
- I promise.
- Yeah,good.Good man.

397
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,550
- Nathan.
- What is it?

398
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:37,740
Why didn't you.Look at this.

399
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:52,810
So what were you doingjoyriding this thing,anyway?

400
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:56,670
My father.He's in construction.

401
00:24:56,670 --> 00:25:00,820
He promised me over and over again,ever since i was little,

402
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:04,020
That he'd teach me how to drive a loader.

403
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:06,290
That was before he left.

404
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:09,580
So i figured i'd teach myselfso if he ever came back,

405
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:12,920
I could show him that i didn't need him.

406
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:16,280
I know the feeling,bud.

407
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:20,900
My dad was a firefighter,and now i am too.

408
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,320
But i did it without his help.

409
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,150
Is it hard?

410
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:27,710
No,it's the best job in the world.

411
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:30,770
Look,i'll tell you what.

412
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:31,810
As soon as we get out of here,

413
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:33,110
I'll take you down to the firehouse,

414
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,330
and we'll go for a ride inthe truck.

415
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:35,670
How's that sound?

416
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,840
Cool.

417
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,140
Cool.

418
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,100
Last chance.I can call the union secretary right now

419
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,450
And send out an emailblast to the entire c.f.d.

420
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:47,400
I'm sorry,but no.

421
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,550
I don't understand.

422
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:50,100
This is the oneyard line.

423
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,040
The last thing anybodyheard is that podcast.

424
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,630
I always said i was gonna run this campaign

425
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:56,840
On the issues that affect firefighters.

426
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,860
Personal business is offlimits.

427
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,440
Now,if that means i lose.

428
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,560
Yeah,it does.

429
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:08,400
I mean,what have we been working for here?

430
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,880
Look,if you want,i'll take the hit.

431
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,210
The email doesn't have to come from you.

432
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:14,490
This isn't washington,isabella.

433
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:17,050
I think he means it.

434
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:23,030
Fair enough.

435
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:28,420
I'm gonna go home and get some rest.

436
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,740
Thanks,randy.I've enjoyed it.

437
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:31,810
Best of luck tonight.

438
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:33,910
Thanks.

439
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:38,120
Damn.

440
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,950
I sure do love me a woman in uniform.

441
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:42,760
What you doing here?

442
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,520
I was in the area.

443
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,640
I thought i'd swing byand check out your digs.

444
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,920
You did,did you?

445
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,140
That's my partner,gabby.

446
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:57,180
This is devon.

447
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,290
We got a lot of inventory here,so.

448
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:00,920
When can you get out of here?

449
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,280
My shift goes until tomorrow morning.

450
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,440
Well,you get a break or something?

451
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,590
not officially,but.

452
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:10,190
Ambulance 61.Woman in distress.

453
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:11,210
why don't you come on a ridealong?

454
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:13,770
- For real?
- Yeah.We do ridealongs all the time.

455
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:15,800
Hop in back.

456
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:21,960
with all the eyes on this house,

457
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,440
You really think it's a good idea to bring people on ridealongs?

458
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,200
What,i can't have a friend here?

459
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:30,660
You know what,shay?

460
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,620
Whatever you want to do.

461
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:45,830
She showed up here about 20 minutes ago,acting all kinds of crazy.

462
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,840
Slapping her own face,chewing on her hair.

463
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,770
I can try.

464
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:55,120
I want to be the boom.

465
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,250
you have to feel theweather to be the boom.

466
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:01,410
Think it's bath salts?

467
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:03,630
You better prep 2 milligrams of midazolam.

468
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:06,370
People smoke bath saltslike amphetamines these days.

469
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:07,860
I want to be the boom.

470
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,790
Ma'am.

471
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:13,360
There.We're here to help you,all right?

472
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,080
Just calm down.Tell me your name.

473
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,650
You want to take it fromme?Take the boom in me?

474
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:20,070
No,just want to help.

475
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:23,080
You fingerprint me?

476
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,620
And you want to take it off me.

477
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:28,180
My god.This chick is flat whacked.

478
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,000
Don't laugh at me!

479
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,440
You wait.And you take it!

480
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,840
Easy,all right?Everything's gonna be all right?

481
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,120
- Okay.
- Hold on,hold on.

482
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,870
It's gonna be all right.

483
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,380
xxxxxxxxx

484
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,740
You're okay.

485
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:58,810
Okay,let's get her on the backboard.

486
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:01,650
That was wild,man.

487
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:17,850
Nathan.

488
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:21,540
How'd you start this thing,buddy?There's no key.

489
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:25,430
Nathan.

490
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,910
It's easy.

491
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:32,610
You span the two contactswith something metal.

492
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,790
What'd you use to do it?

493
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:37,780
Screwdriver.

494
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,000
What's up?

495
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,290
I thought only cops had badges.

496
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:23,070
Nope.We do too.

497
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:24,380
Wear 'em on our dress uniforms.

498
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:26,370
Really?

499
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,980
What happened to my dad's?

500
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:35,520
Your mom never took you to see it?

501
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,660
Come on,i'll give you the nickel tour.

502
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,460
Cool.

503
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,330
I don't know if youever spoke to kelly today?

504
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:01,490
No,i haven't.

505
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:04,510
Well,you tell him when you see him.

506
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:07,010
Missing today's shift was unacceptable.

507
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:10,910
I expect a phone call and an explanation.

508
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,320
Of course,chief.

509
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:20,450
Carry on.

510
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,050
Rise and shine,griffin.

511
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:37,180
Shift's over.

512
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,490
We gonna eat breakfast?

513
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:40,760
After we run an errand.

514
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:51,250
Kelly! Kelly,you here?

515
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:54,190
Kelly? 

516
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,860
Kelly?

517
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:02,050
No,it's just me.

518
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:04,170
Have you heard from severideat all since yesterday?

519
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:06,840
No,not since he went jogging.

520
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:09,710
Give me your car keys.

521
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:11,540
Thanks,buddy.

522
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:14,790
I'll be back.

523
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:31,200
No,come on.No.

524
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,640
Good morning.

525
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:04,520
No one was here,so i figured i'd just serve myself.

526
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:10,370
Well,you have to leave.Right now.

527
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,160
I want my money.

528
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,100
What if i can't pay?

529
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,140
You know,all things considered,

530
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:31,730
i like to think of myself as a fair man.

531
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:35,610
I believe in taking people at their word,

532
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:38,260
Offering second chances,that kind of thing.

533
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:40,600
Now,you take the owners of game day.

534
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,130
I gave them a chance to pay.

535
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:44,790
They refused.

536
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:47,740
I gave them a second chance,

537
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:51,910
and once again,they refused.

538
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,570
Then.

539
00:33:57,570 --> 00:34:00,600
They had that bad luck.

540
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:02,350
arthur,there's no need to.

541
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:04,070
Shut up!

542
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:20,060
Jay!

543
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:30,010
Drop the gun.You're under arrest.

544
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:31,300
You son of a bitch.

545
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,370
Put the gun down,arthur.

546
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:35,510
I swear to god,i'll make you eat it.

547
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,510
Don't move.

548
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:51,940
Were you shot?

549
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,990
Would you mind taking mycell phone out of my pocketAnd putting it to my ear?

550
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:56,190
You got to dial 911.

551
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:01,850
This is detective jay halstead,badge number 51163.

552
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,800
Nathan?

553
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,440
Buddy?

554
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,880
Nathan.Answer me,damn it.Wake up,bud.

555
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,650
Kelly!

556
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,310
Brachial artery bleed.

557
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:02,540
I don't know how muchlonger he can hold out.

558
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:04,110
We've been at it all night.

559
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:05,360
Hang on,buddy.

560
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,090
We're almost there,all right?

561
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:09,080
Don't give up on me,okay?

562
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:13,800
Got it.

563
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,620
This is randy.

564
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:33,050
Yeah.Yeah?

565
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:40,210
Yeah?Okay.Thanks.

566
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,320
Well?

567
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:47,280
I,lost.

568
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,930
Was it even close?

569
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:58,690
We ran a good campaign.

570
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:00,390
You really did,mouch.

571
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:02,870
And who the hell careswhat the numbers were?

572
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:04,890
You got every vote where it counts.

573
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:07,800
Firehouse 51.

574
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:11,380
And i know that i'm sureas hell proud of you.

575
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,510
We all are.

576
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:20,340
Thanks,guys.

577
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:24,850
You lucked out,cowboy.

578
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:25,860
It's pretty much a throughandthrough.

579
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:29,610
You'll need some stitches,but otherwise you're fine.

580
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:33,020
Thanks.

581
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:35,020
You two okay?

582
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,230
Yeah.

583
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,930
I got to say,this didn't turn out the way i thought it would,

584
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:39,280
Butyou got the job done.

585
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,440
Yeah,and i caught a bullet in the process.

586
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,320
You say that like it's a bad thing.

587
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,640
You know,since you were shot on a job,

588
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,640
That pretty much means youget to choose your next detail.

589
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:49,530
Intelligence.I want intelligence.

590
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,750
Yeah,well,we'll seewhat we can do about that.

591
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:58,040
You know.

592
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:01,120
This doesn't have to change things for us.

593
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:05,090
I wish that were true.

594
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,490
What do you mean?

595
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:13,000
I mean that when we first met.

596
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,220
I didn't sign up for this.

597
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:18,310
My brother and sisterinlawhave the best relationship i've ever seen.

598
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:21,240
Except for when he goes undercover.

599
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,270
It changes people.

600
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:27,880
Maybe if the circumstances were different.

601
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,520
Maybe one day they will be.

602
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:35,050
Maybe.

603
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,060
What the hell happened?

604
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,930
I saved our damn bar.That's what happened.

605
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:40,670
That she did.

606
00:39:55,870 --> 00:40:01,270
There is no greater love than to lay down one's life for another.

607
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,920
This badge case stands as a memorial

608
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,810
To our fallen firefighters and paramedics,

609
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:13,400
Who gave their lives in service 

610
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,550
to the citizens of chicago.

611
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:35,700
It's okay to cry here.

612
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:38,690
I have.

613
00:40:56,970 --> 00:40:59,430
Kelly. Kelly.

614
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,420
Mom,this is him.

615
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,900
This is the man who saved me.
