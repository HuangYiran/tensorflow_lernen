{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If this got into the wrong hands,

63
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}our world would've stopped in its tracks.

00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Looks like an old OSS file.

65
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Project Armageddon, the ultimate weapon.

00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:50,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No one ever notices time until it's gone.

68
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This was our agreement.

69
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}one last mission and I'm out for good.

70
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're really gonna take a powder on us? Leave us high and dry?

71
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No more dangling from zip lines or high-speed chases.

72
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My family needs me now.

73
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And they can never know I was a spy.

74
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I respect that, agent. But a word of advice: tell 'em who you are.

75
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Life's too short for secrets.

76
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Push out a good one, a nice little fire-breather for us, all right?

77
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The future of the OSS depends on it.

78
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's not stand around bumping gums, people.

79
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wanna figure out what makes Tick Tock tick.

80
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thumb battle.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go.

82
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:38,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, kids. I got a new idea for a reality show.

83

00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}where I hunt real spies on TV.

85
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:46,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What do you think? - Uh, it's pretty out there, Dad.

86
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Got you. - Nice takedown.

87
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:54,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}one point for me. Yeah, I mean, where are you gonna find a spy?

88
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:57,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hi! Honey! - Hey, sweetheart!

90
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You owe me a dollar.

91
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Told you we would get here before her.

92
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I said take it slow, but that was a night shy of eternity

93
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and a morning past forever.

94
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stepmother is always late for everything.

00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:14,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Technically I'm early, 'cause the baby wasn't even due until tomorrow.

96
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:15,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ease up.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What took so long?

98
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:20,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh, just must have lost track of time.

99
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh, God!  - Here we go! Oh!

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. And you'll have a new baby sister

104
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:35,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- in five, four, three, two...

105
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I put my life on the line

106
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}every time I search for...

107
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...the spies among us.

108
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look!

109
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm Wilbur Wilson...

110
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}... Spy Hunter.

111
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mondays after your local news.

112
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Last piece of bacon.

113
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mine!

114
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yours.

115
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is the baby throwing food again?

116
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I would say so.

117
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you watch her, please?

118
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have to go change again.

119
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Again.

120
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Ah! Seriously?

121
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:41,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Her gas bombs are gonna take the paint right off this house.

122
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You watch her. - No. You.

123
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Breath-holding contest? - You're on.

124
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}one point for me.

125
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Good morning, little Spy Hunters. - Dad!

126
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you have time to eat breakfast with us?

127
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I sure do. - Yes!

128
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I don't.

129
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I swear I had an extra five minutes...

130
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...just a few minutes ago.

131
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Where'd the time go? - Told you he wouldn't have time.

132
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You owe me a dollar.

133
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:16,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey... Do you remember our five-year plan?

134
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If my show does well,

135
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:21,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then I'll have all the time in the world

136
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to spend with you and you, OK?

137
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Meanwhile, time is just slipping away.

138
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Morning, honey. - Oh, bye, honey.

139
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I gotta get to work. - Oh, um, OK.

140
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:35,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Uh, good-bye hug? - Oh, yeah.

141
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh...

142
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Bye. - Bye.

143
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:44,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Rebecca, behave at school. OK? - I know.

144
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, Cecil, uh...

145
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...feed the dog.

146
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He doesn't really eat.

147
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He just watches us.

148
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here, Argonaut.

149
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:58,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's kind of creepy.

150
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}our worst fear has happened: Time is speeding up.

151
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:08,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not cranking my chain, are you? This is on the up and up?

152
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:10,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-  Good night, sir. - Good night?

153
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you talking about, doll face? You just got back from lunch.

154
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:16,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- But it's five o'clock, sir. - Five o'clock?

155
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Armageddon device.

156
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're running out of time.

157
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:29,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So he put a peanut butter and jelly sandwich in your face

158
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and then he stole your homework?

159
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:35,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Technically, it was his homework. I was just doing it for him.

160
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And what about you, Miss Rebecca? How was your day?

161
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Same old, same old.

162
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- So I heard.

163
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The principal called me about your pranks.

164
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:47,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hey, kids! - Dad! Come, sit by me!

165
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, kids, but I have to go write up this report before I can do anything.

166
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Save me some leftovers.

167
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:56,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Dad? Can you teach me how to be a Spy Hunter?

168
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, there's always time for that.

169
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK. Repeat after me:

170
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"I'm Cecil Wilson, Spy Hunter,

171
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:09,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I'll catch you... later."

172
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm Cecil Wilson, Spy Hunter,

173
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:15,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I'll catch you... later!

174
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:18,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here's the important part.

175
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lift the eyebrow.

176
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Respect the golden arch.

177
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's my secret.

178
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How many spies have you caught?

179
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Um... Well, none.

180
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:35,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Um... But that's not really what the show's about.

181
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you're not a spy-catching superhero?

182
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, not yet...

183
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:42,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but...

184
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How's my girl?

185
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She made two poopies today.

186
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two poopies? She's six away from the house record.

187
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh!

188
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, don't get snotty.

189
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I lost my appetite.

190
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:01,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll go talk to her.

191
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:05,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What am I doing wrong?

192
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've tried so hard to connect with her

193
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- but she just hates me. - No, she doesn't hate you.

194
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:14,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- She totally hates me. - No, she doesn't. Maybe a little.

195
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

196
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think she's just trying to adjust to a new situation.

197
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:24,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've been married for two years.

198
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:25,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right.

199
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad's had less time for us

200
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}ever since Stepmother entered the picture.

201
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And she's keeping something from us.

202
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can feel it. She's not who she says she is!

203
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:40,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't think she's really an interior decorator?

204
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:44,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, look at this place! She's obviously evil.

205
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:46,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I think she's nice.

206
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There is something she's hiding from us.

207
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Doesn't mean she deserves your blue cheese dressing bomb.

208
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My best prank yet.

209
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not hearing very well increased my other senses.

210
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:00,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like smell.

211
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:04,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry, she never comes into my room anyway.

212
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:06,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you have a sec?

213
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:09,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

214
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was going through the basement

215
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:15,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I found some things that I thought you might wanna have.

216
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom.

217
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:29,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know you miss your mom and I could never replace her.

218
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:35,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just would really like it if maybe we could be friends?

219
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom always said she loved my practical jokes.

220
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:41,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love your practical jokes. I think you're hilarious.

221
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think I'm funny?

222
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The one you did last month to your father

223
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:48,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when you filled his toothpaste with blueberry filling?

224
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:51,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And his teeth were blue for like four days.

225
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was epic.

226
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And how about the time I hooked up his nose hair clipper

227
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- to a power saw?

228
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some of my best work.

229
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or the baby powder in the hair dryer trick?

230
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:09,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I had meant that prank for you.

231
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know.

232
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.

233
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's OK. It was just a joke.

234
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's something, um...

235
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...I would like you to have.

236
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:27,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is something my parents gave me when I was around your age.

237
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And my mother said it would always protect me,

238
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:33,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}even in my darkest hour.

239
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What I think she meant by that was,

240
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:39,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I would always have her love and support.

241
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're really giving this to me?

242
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:47,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's something that's very special to me and my family

243
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:49,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I want you to have it...

244
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:54,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...because you're so very special.

245
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:57,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rebecca...

246
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:00,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...I'm really looking forward to us being friends.

247
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Me, too.

248
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good night.

249
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Marissa, wait!

250
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm so...

251
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...sorry.

252
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good going.

253
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I tried to warn her!

254
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got to make it up to her.

255
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why do I have to be the one to always apologize?

256
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like what about that time that you just kept on talking and I was...

257
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:59,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I turned off my hearing aids.

258
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK! I'll make it up to her!

259
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's right, you know.

260
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:17,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, the show is called Spy Hunter.

261
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At some point, I should actually catch a spy.

262
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He thinks I'm a complete loser.

263
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:23,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not what he meant.

264
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They just wanna spend more time with you.

265
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is that smell?

266
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, did the baby spit up on you again?

267
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:32,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- In breaking news... - Something like that.

268
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...our worst fears have been confirmed.

269
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}According to scientists, there are now, literally, less hours in the day.

270
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Studies show that time is running out.

271
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Time is speeding up.

272
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At first, we were losing nanoseconds, but now we 're losing hours.

273
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:49,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}By tomorrow, we'll have lost days. By the day after that, a year.

274
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:53,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At this rate, we will be completely out of time... in no time.

275
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:56,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Experts are divided on what's causing this phenomenon,

276
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:01,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}although one man has claimed credit. We received this video moments ago.

277
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Citizens of the world,

278
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:08,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I find you all guilty of wasting time.

279
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You fill your days with meaningless pursuits

280
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:17,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}instead of treasuring moments with those you love.

281
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You will no longer take time for granted,

282
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:25,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for I am taking all of the time in the world from you.

283
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:28,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Project Armageddon has been activated

284
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I will continue to speed up time until time runs out,

285
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and the world will end.

286
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:39,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am the Time Keeper

287
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:43,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I want more time!

288
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:47,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Only minutes ago, OSS Director Danger D'Amo addressed the threat.

289
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:51,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The OSS will find this Time Keeper, and when we do,

290
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we will punch his clock.

291
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a decrease of one minute per hour as now...

292
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tick Tock has escaped.

293
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:00,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, this is not good.

294
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Actually, this is awesome.

295
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Could you imagine the promotion I would get

296
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:07,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if I landed an interview with this guy, the Time Holder?

297
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Time Keeper. - Not to mention the hero factor

298
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:13,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for tracking down an international supervillain. Not too shabby.

299
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honey, I think being a hero isn't really what the kids need from you right now.

300
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just what they need now.

301
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's what the world needs.

302
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:28,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where is the Chronos Sapphire you promised me?

303
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Time waits for no man, no man but me.

304
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:35,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That one little rock is the only element

305
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:38,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that can stop the Armageddon device.

306
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:40,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Trust me, it will be ours.

307
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Time and my temper are short.

308
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You waste my time...

00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and I'll waste you.

310
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:56,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We will find the Chronos Sapphire...

311
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:57,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and when we do...

312
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:01,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...no one will be able to stop us.

313
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No one.

314
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:14,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK, princess. You're a little sleepy head, huh?

315
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no.

316

00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:34,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chronos Sapphire needed to stop Armageddon.

319
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:37,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Deliver Chronos to OSS immediately.

320
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Rebecca.

321
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hope you're working on that apology.

322
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:45,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Make sure you write "P.S., Cecil is innocent."

323
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A handmade coupon,

327
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Rebecca?

328
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you have that necklace from last night?

329
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Why?

330
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was just wondering if maybe I could, um...

331
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...maybe I can have it back?

332
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want the necklace back?

333
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:17,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I realized it needs to be cleaned, and, uh... you know, it's old.

334
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:21,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I get it. You can't trust me with it.

335
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:25,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happened to "This necklace is so special, and so are you"?

336
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Am I supposed to pretend that you really meant that?

337
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:31,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just need the necklace back. I can't really explain it right now.

338
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:32,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can have it!

339
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:35,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I never wanted your stupid necklace anyway.

340
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:39,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You only care about yourself! You don't care about us at all!

341
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:52,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have to go on an important mission, I mean, errand.

342
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There are snacks in the fridge.

343

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you guys need anything?

345
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My mom.

346
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll be fine.

347
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right.

348
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Argonaut.

349
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Watch the kids.

350

352
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-  Baby secure. - All right.

00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go for a ride.

354
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:50,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey! I thought you gave that back to Marissa.

355
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait till she looks in the box.

356
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Welcome back, agent.

357
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that the Chronos Sapphire? Without that, our goose is cooked.

358
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:02,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give it to Mommy. Thank you, pumpkin.

359
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here, give it to me.

360
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:09,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh.

361
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Another prank.

362
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Baby food. - I'm sorry.

363

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My stepdaughter is a little... upset.

364

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I can get it back. - Chronos Sapphire can wait.

366
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your old pallie Tick Tock has just been made

367
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you're the only one that can scoop him up.

368
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pop the clutch. You're back on the clock.

369
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about the Chronos?

370
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:32,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You nab Tick Tock, he'll lead us to the Time Keeper.

371
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't need the Chronos.

372
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So Rebecca can keep the necklace.

373
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It would mean a lot if she could.

374
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:41,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK. I'll do it. I just have to go get my kids first.

375
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Those ankle biters'll be fine!

376
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:54,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is Seeker 17. We have a lock on the Chronos Sapphire.

377
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:56,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Repeat, we have found the Chronos Sapphire.

378
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Prepare to breach the entrance.

379
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You really shouldn't do that.

380
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But if you're going to, give her vampire teeth.

381

383
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're really stepping up your game with these pranks.

384
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not my prank.

385
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:25,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Warning, residence subject to immediate attack.

388
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:34,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is obviously Marissa's attempt to get me back.

389
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take shelter in the panic room now.

390
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:42,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, and if we don't, I suppose something really terrible

391
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}will happen to us.

392
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Scanning.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Why? - 'Cause it's a room, and I'm panicking.

399
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello, children.

00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:32,340

00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:34,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in the event that my work ever put the family in danger.

402
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Her work?

403
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's something I never told you about myself

00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:40,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because it was a matter of national security.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am a spy.

406

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's not cool enough.

409
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Argonaut is an Advanced Robotic Guardian Operative

410
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}designed to protect you.

411
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I still think this is a prank.

412
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is not a prank.

413
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The dog is talking.

414
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I noticed.

415
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, it's not the sort of thing you'd miss, is it, really?

416
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:16,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A small, handsome dog talking with an English accent, like James Bond.

417
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:27,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anyway, I've been assigned to protect you, so give me five.

418
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what cool people say, isn't it? Anyway, let's shake hands.

419
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:33,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello. How do you do?

420
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:37,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah! Oh, no! I hate when that happens! I am gonna need that back.

421
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sentry mode? Attack mode?

422
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:42,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think you better keep it in sentry mode.

423
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pop it back on, any time you're ready.

424
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Good thinking. - No, seriously.

425
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I have it back now? 'Cause I am gonna fall over.

426
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The panic room is being attacked.

427
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You must leave now.

428
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:05,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The jet luges will take you to OSS headquarters.

429
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And sit. Do you get it?

430
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's what humans usually say to dogs.

431
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I reversed it, I flipped it.

432
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, this is gonna be great.

433
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I tell you, we're gonna have a...

434
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:25,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I usually have to eat grass or a slipper to feel this sick. Oh.

435
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:29,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wasn't ready, that's all. I'm fine, I'm fine.

436
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:49,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do not let the Chronos Sapphire get away!

437
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:56,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A mini camera is not that impressive anymore.

438
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:59,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}People have them in their phones.

439
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, how small is it?

440
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That's impossible. - Dad!

441
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry. What?

442
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad, help us!

443
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, there was an air show behind me.

444
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:13,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no such thing as invisibility powder.

445
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:16,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, Argonaut. Start talking.

446
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who were those guys with the giant goggles? What do they want?

447
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How long has Marissa been a spy?

448
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:24,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK. Your stepmom will answer all of your questions post-mission.

449
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have a question. Who's flying this thing?

450
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought you were.

451
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no. They do not look like pet lovers.

452
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:35,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello, children. If you're watching this, your escape jets are under attack.

453
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are going to have to initiate evasive maneuvers

454
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:40,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to get you to OSS even faster.

455
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Brace yourselves. - Oh, great.

456
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:51,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's like a big video game.

457
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:54,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grab your controller and steer slowly!

458
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:57,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Whoa! - I'm gonna crash!

459
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna hurl.

460
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:04,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right. Puke goes in the bag, not on my fur.

461
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:15,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're gaining!

462
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cecil!

463
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do something!

464
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:29,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He is doing something. He's puking.

465
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We might need a bigger bag.

466
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In fact, we might need a bigger spaceship.

467
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It smells like fish socks in here. Can we at least open a window?

468
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ugh. It's not much fun in here.

469
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey! You opened up mine!

470
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:44,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fresh air. That helps.

471
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:47,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love this. I love sticking my head out the window. It's my favorite thing.

472
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry!

473
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cecil! How may puke bags do you have left?

474
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Make 'em count!

475
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good job, Cecil!

476
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:35,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Never underestimate the power of puke.

477
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Agent Argonaut reporting.

478
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:42,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, the kids are fine.

479
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't say the same about the house.

480
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why? What did they do?

481
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:49,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They didn't do anything. They didn't destroy the house. Tick Tock's men did.

482
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?! Argonaut, I told you to watch them!

483
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am watching them. I'm watching them puke and scream.

484
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:57,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We've gotta discuss hazard pay. - Just get them to the OSS.

485
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:58,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want a raise!

486
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:00,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's only one person I want waiting there to greet them.

487
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:03,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OSS Headquarters. How can I direct your call?

488
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I saved your life. one point for me.

489
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:08,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whatever. The puke bags were my idea.

490
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why do you argue about everything? You're brother and sister.

491
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're fighting like cats and dogs,

492
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:16,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}which I could understand why cats and dogs fight.

493
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:19,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cats are awful. Just chillax.

494
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:23,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Part "chill," part "relax." I fused 'em to make a trendy word.

495
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Welcome to the OSS.

496
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who are you?

497
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:42,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Carmen Cortez, secret agent of the OSS.

498
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your stepmom is my aunt.

499
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:50,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, a word of caution to you would-be supervillains out there...

500
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:54,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your best defense may be... a jelly donut.

501
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:58,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What am I saying? What are they gonna do with that?

502
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What, are they gonna throw them at 'em?

503
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:04,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just say it. I'm too attractive.

504
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's face it.

505
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:09,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've never caught a spy, and I probably never will.

506
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:12,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I say we go after the Time Keeper.

507
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, that's realistic.

508
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:16,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are you at with that piece for Spy Week?

509
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not due till Friday.

510
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:18,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is Friday.

511
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Time's speeding up, Wilson. Don't you keep up with the news?

512
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:26,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get me something on someone, anyone!

513
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And get it to me yesterday

514
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:30,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or there won't be a tomorrow for you at the station. Got it?

515
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's time to get serious.

516
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:41,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Marissa's not picking up. Maybe she's under radio silence.

517
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's got a lot of explaining to do, man.

518
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:46,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She never told you she was a spy, huh?

519
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, in her defense, she was retired.

520
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Well, hello. - Hey, Argonaut!

521
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:56,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're a big girl now. Is that titanium alloy?

522
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Treat? - Yes, please.

523
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cheers.

524
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cool.

525
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:15,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wanna see how I got started as a spy?

526
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:18,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah!

527
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the old Spy Kids division.

528
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:28,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Woa.

529
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:34,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They shut it down seven years ago due to budget cuts.

530
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:37,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really sad. It was ahead of its time.

531
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:42,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Spy Kids were an elite juvenile division of the OSS.

532
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:45,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going to explode you.

533
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Established to go where adult spies couldn't go

534
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and do what ordinary spies couldn't do.

535
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ralphie, it's me! We went to the academy together.

536
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How you do...

537
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:58,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh. Now I see what, they've turned him off. Just as well. He's annoying.

538
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd like to bring back the Spy Kids division one day.

539
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:06,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We call those Stompers and Hammer Hands.

540
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:10,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They use electron fields to create superhuman impact force.

541
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These are awesome.

542
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:13,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can crush things.

543
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Field ambush supplies"?

544
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Built to help a spy create on-the-spot booby traps

545
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:23,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}ambushes, mass confusion, and pranks.

546
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Pranks? - I'll tell you what.

547
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:29,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll let you guys pick out one gadget each as a souvenir.

548
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Mine. - Mine.

549
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't get too excited. I said that I'd let you guys pick out a gadget,

550
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I didn't say I'd activate it.

551
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Back in the day, the kids who made the best spies

552
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:41,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}were the ones who didn't wait around for the perfect gadgets.

553
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:44,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They made stuff happen with what they had on hand.

554
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's that?

555
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:56,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Me and my brother, Juni.

556
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:00,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We were the first and last of the Spy Kids program.

557
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:02,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where is he?

558
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We shall not speak of him. Let's go.

559
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:10,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And this is where our grand tour ends.

560
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait here. Marissa will pick you guys up in a minute.

561
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:15,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can we be candidates for the new Spy Kids program?

562
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Time will tell. Sorry, guys, gotta go.

563
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:20,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OSS has us working around the clock.

564
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:25,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have to stop the Time Keeper before the Time Keeper stops time.

565
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:29,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Time Keeper. That's not much of a villain's name, is it?

566
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:31,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, the Time Keeper. Has he got a watch, has he?

567
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not a scary name at all.

568
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:35,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rubbish.

569
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have reached your destination for this mission.

570
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:07,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good luck, agent.

571
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:10,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So Tick Tock attacked our house

572
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and chased after your brother and sister.

573
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you think we should do?

574
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:16,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Annihilate.

575
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:20,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Annihilate? Good thinking.

576
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Welcome back to the big-time, agent. Suit up.

577
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Intel places Tick Tock at this location.

578
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:30,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Spot him and let him lead us to the Time Keeper's Armageddon device.

579
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:33,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then call in and wait for backup.

580
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here's my backup.

581
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:41,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, you. I need you at six o'clock, right here.

582
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on! Bring it in.

583
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Armageddon device will be here any minute

584
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:51,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and we must be ready for its arrival!

585
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:53,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh, cover the exit.

586
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:55,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There you go. Good work.

587
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:58,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Focus up, focus. Focus!

588
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing? We're moments away.

589
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My plan is almost complete.

590
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just need to get the Chronos back from those meddlesome kids.

591
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shh...

592
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:24,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh! Are you kidding me? Is that you?

593
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:26,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you drop your transmission?

594
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:29,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my God. Gentlemen, please.

595
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:32,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That smells like lentils and desperation.

596
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:35,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My God, that's mental. It's following you.

597
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:38,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get back on your marks. Focus.

598
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:41,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm blinded. Ow!

599
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:44,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's here, it's here. It's finally here.

600
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:50,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Places, everyone. This is the moment we've all been waiting for.

601
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right on time.

602
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:57,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hickory-dickory dock.

603
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The spy ran up the clock.

604
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:04,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The clock struck one, and the spy was done.

605
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:06,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Game, set, and match, Tick Tock.

606
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait a minute. Hold on.

607
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:13,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is your sidekick? A nose-picking baby?

608
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:15,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gentlemen, get in here.

609
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:18,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Baby, looks like we've been set up.

00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:04,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should have a competition to see which one of you is the most annoying.

00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that's the second hand.

746

816
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:11,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- They're just souvenirs. - Not anymore.

817
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:26,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hammer time.

818
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:45,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cool.

819
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A watch shop?

820
00:50:00,990 --> 00:50:03,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Slight left and proceed around building.

821
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:08,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Turn right now.

822
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Spy detected.

823
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:12,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's a dumpster. - Spy detected.

824
00:50:13,070 --> 00:50:16,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Walk forward now. Turn left now.

825
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:19,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Left foot, right foot, left foot, big right foot.

826
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:21,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Center and stop.

827
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:23,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Proceed below.

828
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:27,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The annoying voice is saying there's a spy right here. Look.

829
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Proceed below now.

830
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:33,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is more than a dumpster!

831
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:45,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Sorry! - It's OK! Do it again!

832
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:09,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, shiitake mushrooms.

833
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:22,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come here. Come here, come here.

834
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK, ready?

835
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:26,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wilbur Wilson, Spy Hunter here.

836
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:29,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As you can see, I'm in some sort of underground secret lair

837
00:51:29,410 --> 00:51:31,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}where the battle for freedom and justice

838
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:33,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is being fought by our country's top spies.

839
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:35,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I really can't see much from up here

840
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:38,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but we can zoom in with our Spy Hunt Cam and get a closer look.

841
00:51:39,090 --> 00:51:40,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, the kids are gonna flip when they see this.

842
00:51:42,990 --> 00:51:45,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you get that? You got it? Go, go, go.

843
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:47,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Argonaut, do something!

844
00:51:47,330 --> 00:51:49,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you want me to do? I'm a lover, not a fighter.

845
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Attack mode!

846

00:51:58,140 --> 00:51:59,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's show time!

848
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go, Argo, go!

849
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:10,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, someone put that on YouTube!

850
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:18,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Time flies when you're having fun.

851
00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:26,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My necklace!

852
00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:29,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's get the kids out of here!

853
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:34,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Argonaut!

854
00:52:34,950 --> 00:52:36,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Release!

855
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:39,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, come on! I was gonna bury him in the backyard!

856
00:52:39,350 --> 00:52:43,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let them go. It's all part of the plan.

857
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:46,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have the Chronos Sapphire.

858
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:49,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing can stop us now.

859
00:52:56,230 --> 00:52:58,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry about the necklace, Marissa.

860
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:00,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Sorry about the necklace, Marissa."

861
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:01,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I should've given it back to you when you asked.

862
00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:03,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, you should've.

863
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We had no idea the Time Keeper wanted it.

864
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"We're just dumb kids."

865
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:09,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You couldn't have known. It was classified.

866
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The whole world's in big trouble.

867
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:13,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't look at me.

868
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's all our fault.

869
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:18,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I'm sorry I didn't share with you that I was a spy.

870
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:22,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But it was important to me that you were both protected and safe.

871
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:24,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's important is stopping the Time Keeper.

872
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:26,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give us another chance.

873
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:31,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You two have been so very brave and I'm so proud of you.

874
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:34,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That sounds like something my mom would say.

875
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:41,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- They want us back for a debrief. - Take the kids back to OSS.

876
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:42,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'll meet you there. - Got it.

877
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:44,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks for rescuing us.

878
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:46,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Any time.

879
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:52,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I used to get in trouble like this all the time.

880
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:55,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi, sweetheart. Sorry I missed you. Great news!

881
00:53:55,290 --> 00:53:59,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got the most amazing footage of a real spy battle at the watch shop!

882
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:02,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna put it on the air tonight, primetime!

883
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:03,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- The kids are gonna be so proud. - Oh, no.

884
00:54:04,070 --> 00:54:06,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Love you, miss you, need you. Bye! Call me back!

885
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You did it, Spy Hunter.

886
00:54:10,110 --> 00:54:11,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's great!

887
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:14,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're gonna win an Emmy for this. A Pulitzer.

888
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:17,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa, go back, go back. Does she have a baby with her?

889
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, she does! Oh, that's priceless!

890
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:24,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK, we're gonna need a graphic that reads "Spies Are Unfit Moms."

891
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:27,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, Wilbur, see if you can get a quote from Child Protective Services.

892
00:54:27,590 --> 00:54:30,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If we're lucky, they'll take the kids away, put 'em in foster care! Yeah!

893
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:36,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Wilbur! - Sorry. I'm a klutz.

894
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:39,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's all right. I've got the original tape right here.

895
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:43,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hm! Didn't get any lunch.

896
00:54:43,610 --> 00:54:45,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tastes like chicken! Want some?

897
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:48,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}out!

898
00:54:53,050 --> 00:54:55,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jeez.

899
00:54:58,190 --> 00:54:59,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Spy detected.

900
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:01,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, really? Great.

901
00:55:01,990 --> 00:55:03,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi, honey.

902
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:08,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't "honey" me. There's no "honey"ing anymore.

903
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:10,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You're a spy!

904
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:14,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You found out. - Well, I'm a Spy Hunter.

905
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:16,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And apparently I'm not a very good one, since I've been living with one.

906
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:19,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I retired the day we had the baby...

907
00:55:20,910 --> 00:55:24,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...because our family is the most important thing in the world to me.

908
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:26,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And...

909
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:28,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...I'm so sorry.

910
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:31,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow. I feel like such a fool.

911
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why did you marry me?

912
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:36,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You must've lost a bet, right? - You're the man I love.

913
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:39,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, uh, now I'm the man without a job

914
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and maybe without a family.

915
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:44,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are the kids?

00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:52,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're probably safer there anyway.

918
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:54,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, their own dad can't protect them.

919
00:55:56,610 --> 00:55:58,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just tell them I love them.

920
00:56:00,050 --> 00:56:01,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about us?

921
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:03,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just...

922
00:56:04,390 --> 00:56:05,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...need time.

923
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:22,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're all running out of time.

924
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:25,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some predicted it would come in a blaze of fire,

925
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:29,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a giant flood, but it was the ancient Mayans who got it right

926
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:32,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when they predicted an end to the human calendar,

927
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:34,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the end of time itself.

928
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:37,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can anyone save us from this impending apocalypse,

929
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:40,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}this final doomsday, this...

930
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:43,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Armageddon.

931
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:47,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Also known as the Wells Experiment.

932
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:49,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Back in the day, this contraption

933
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:52,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}almost caused the end of the world as we know it.

934
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's why the OSS shut the experiment down

935
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:59,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and placed the device in Level 13 lockdown, where it remains today.

936
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:01,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The fate of the world is on the line here.

937
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:06,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's why I'm calling upon one of our most valued and skilled operatives,

938
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Agent Cortez.

939
00:57:09,990 --> 00:57:13,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He has even come out of retirement to help us.

940
00:57:21,630 --> 00:57:22,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah!

941
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:36,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, brother.

942
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:45,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's good to be back. - Then you never should have left.

943
00:57:45,290 --> 00:57:46,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where have you been the last seven years?

944
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:49,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I told you, then it wouldn't be called a secret mission.

945
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:53,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not like I missed you or anything. I needed a break from your face.

946
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:56,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, what an incredible coincidence.

947
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:58,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I needed a break from yours. - Oh, whatever.

948
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's going on over there?

949
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:05,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Family reunion.

950
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:07,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- This isn't about us. - Gosh.

951
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:11,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Carmen, this is about saving the world.

952
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You don't deserve to wear this badge. - Uh...

953
00:58:17,590 --> 00:58:19,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Thanks. - You're welcome.

954
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:22,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, agents. Let's make sure there is a tomorrow.

955
00:58:23,530 --> 00:58:26,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Let's go save the world!

956
00:58:26,730 --> 00:58:30,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do we get to do? What's our assignment?

957
00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:32,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You lose!

958
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:34,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Man! Why are we in time-out?

959
00:58:34,670 --> 00:58:38,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We found the Time Keeper. So, why are we grounded?

960
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:41,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And why do we have to watch the baby?

961
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:42,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Technically, I'm watching her.

962
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:46,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sometimes you're the dog, sometimes you're the baby entertainment center.

963

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Danger D'Amo, director of the OSS.

964
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:51,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wanted to commend you on your brave service.

965
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:54,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You bobbleheads really take after your mom.

966
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stepmom.

967
00:58:57,530 --> 00:58:59,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me give you some advice, kiddo.

968
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't get balled up over that kind of baloney.

969
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:05,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She takes the time to love you... you love her back.

970
00:59:11,910 --> 00:59:14,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Nice watch. - Thanks.

971
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:15,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was a gift from my pops.

972
00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:19,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You sure talk funny. - You sure look funny.

973
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Danger D'Amo. - Yeah.

974
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:25,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you know your name is an anagram?

975
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:31,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Switch the letters of your name around, and it spells...

976
00:59:31,630 --> 00:59:33,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...Armageddon.

977
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:35,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As in the Armageddon device.

978
00:59:36,130 --> 00:59:38,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Either that's a coincidence...

979
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:45,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...or that's just an incredible coincidence.

980
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You're ticking.

981
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:54,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's an old watch.

982
00:59:54,450 --> 00:59:57,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- But you're wearing three more.

983
01:00:01,830 --> 01:00:03,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're the Time Keeper.

984
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:08,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. I'd love to stick around and chat but time is running out.

985
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:17,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The head of the good guys is actually the head of the bad guys?

986
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:20,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I did not see that coming.

987
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:23,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're trapped in here!

988
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look around for a comlink or a phone!

989
01:00:26,550 --> 01:00:28,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have to warn Marissa!

990
01:00:41,670 --> 01:00:43,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Agent Wilson.

991
01:00:43,130 --> 01:00:44,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Turn around! - It's a trap!

992
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:47,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Time Keeper is Danger! - That's his secret identity!

993
01:00:48,170 --> 01:00:51,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, I don't have time for your pranks right now. OK?

994
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:54,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Watch Argonaut watch the baby. Thank you.

995
01:01:06,990 --> 01:01:09,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- The Armageddon device.

996
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:14,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's tiny.

997
01:01:21,270 --> 01:01:24,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If time's the test, family is best.

998
01:01:24,610 --> 01:01:26,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a trap.

999
01:01:26,210 --> 01:01:30,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello, agents. You're right on time.

1000
01:01:34,790 --> 01:01:36,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The kids were right.

1001
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:39,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess I'm not...

1002
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:42,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...who you thought I was.

1003
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:45,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So where's the real Armageddon device?

1004
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:48,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Back at the OSS, where it's always been.

1005
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:49,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And now...

1006
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:53,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...I must get back to it.

1007
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What's that?

1008
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:56,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A really nice watch.

1009
01:01:56,610 --> 01:01:59,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's also a freeze transmitter

1010
01:01:59,580 --> 01:02:01,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for all agents at the OSS.

1011
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:04,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's time to take out the competition.

1012
01:02:16,990 --> 01:02:18,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Danger, don't.

1013
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:23,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now... to stop the world.

1014
01:02:40,350 --> 01:02:42,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why didn't I freeze?

1015
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:45,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm... trapped in here.

1016
01:02:46,290 --> 01:02:48,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need reinforcements.

1017
01:02:48,330 --> 01:02:51,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But there are no reinforcements. They're all frozen.

01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Except...

1019
01:02:56,130 --> 01:02:59,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Time has run out for most of the planet.

1020
01:02:59,670 --> 01:03:01,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eighteen time zones have been frozen

1021
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:04,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}by the Time Keeper's Armageddon device.

1022
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:07,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One thing's for certain... it's heading our way.

1023
01:03:07,210 --> 01:03:09,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But we must not lose hope.

1024
01:03:09,950 --> 01:03:12,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who are we kidding? It's over! We're toast!

1025
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:18,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Attention, Spy Kids. You have been activated.

1026
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:21,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I repeat, you have been activated.

1027
01:03:21,990 --> 01:03:23,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is he talking to us?

1028
01:03:23,430 --> 01:03:27,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At this very moment, the Time Keeper is taking over OSS Headquarters.

1029
01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:30,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your time has come to save the world.

1030
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Every OSS agent has been frozen.

1031
01:03:33,070 --> 01:03:36,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's up to you to shut down the Armageddon device.

1032
01:03:36,510 --> 01:03:39,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get the necklace back. It's the only thing that can stop him.

1033
01:03:40,010 --> 01:03:42,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And how are we supposed to do that?

1034
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:44,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Spy Kids have always been able to beat the bad guys

1035
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:46,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because adults over-think things.

1036
01:03:46,220 --> 01:03:48,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But to a kid, everything is possible.

1037
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:51,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Trust me, I know.

1038
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:54,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just use your imagination and work with each other,

1039
01:03:54,290 --> 01:03:56,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}not against each other.

1040
01:03:56,530 --> 01:03:59,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So no more competing against each other?

1041
01:04:00,030 --> 01:04:01,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good.

1042
01:04:03,730 --> 01:04:06,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Argonaut! - Attack mode, por favor.

1043
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:11,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Attack the door. - Argo smash!

1044
01:04:13,310 --> 01:04:15,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about the baby?

1045
01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:16,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Spy Kids.

1046
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:18,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Spy Dog.

1047
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:19,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Spy Baby.

1048
01:04:24,190 --> 01:04:26,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now that you've been activated as Spy Kids,

1049
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:28,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you are part of an elite team,

1050
01:04:28,530 --> 01:04:32,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and we need to work together, like Juni said.

1051
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:33,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No more competitions.

1052
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:37,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've got to break into the OSS vault,

1053
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}get to the Time Keeper,

1054
01:04:39,370 --> 01:04:41,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}find the Chronos Sapphire,

1055
01:04:41,470 --> 01:04:43,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then use it to stop the Armageddon device,

1056
01:04:43,810 --> 01:04:46,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and, of course, save the world.

1057
01:04:47,110 --> 01:04:50,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cecil, you take the vault. Rebecca, you're on pranks.

1058
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:53,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And l, of course, will take the toughest assignment of all...

1059
01:04:53,750 --> 01:04:55,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll watch the baby.

1060
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:01,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I realized the only way he could freeze agents

1061
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:03,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}was through their OSS badges.

1062
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:04,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There you go.

1063
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:06,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks for trashing mine, Carmen.

1064
01:05:07,770 --> 01:05:10,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks, Juni. Unfreeze your sister.

1065
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:12,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK, but first...

1066
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:14,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...this is how I remember you.

1067
01:05:14,670 --> 01:05:17,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And there we go.

1068
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:18,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Juni! - Hm?

1069
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:19,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Unfreeze her.

1070
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:22,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But it's so peaceful and quiet.

1071
01:05:23,850 --> 01:05:24,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There.

1072
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:27,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This never would've happened if I was mission leader.

1073
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:30,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I activated Rebecca and Cecil. - What?

1074
01:05:31,020 --> 01:05:32,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're more ready than you think.

1075
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:36,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If anything happens to those kids, you're toast.

1076
01:05:36,930 --> 01:05:38,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This way.

1077
01:05:47,170 --> 01:05:51,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Real smooth, diaper lady.

1078
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:52,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was just following my instincts.

1079
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:55,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, your in-stinks!

1080
01:05:55,350 --> 01:05:58,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You two were the best spy team ever.

1081
01:05:58,320 --> 01:05:59,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happened?

1082
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:01,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Where have you been all these years?

1083
01:06:01,650 --> 01:06:05,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I tried to strike out on my own, and I struck out. OK?

1084
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:09,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK, but Mom and Dad left the family business to the both of us.

1085
01:06:09,190 --> 01:06:10,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Well...

1086
01:06:10,860 --> 01:06:15,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess I thought it wasn't cool to keep working with my sister.

1087
01:06:16,370 --> 01:06:18,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's what would've made you cool.

1088
01:06:21,470 --> 01:06:23,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's Marissa?

1089
01:06:23,810 --> 01:06:25,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's quicksand!

1090
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:38,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't make me punch your lights out.

1091
01:06:45,530 --> 01:06:48,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hey, there he is!

1092
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:56,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now you've seen my dark side.

1093
01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:01,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Low battery?

1094
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:12,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Don't rely on your gadgets."

1095
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:21,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hmm...

1096
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:30,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

1097
01:07:30,170 --> 01:07:31,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is anyone in here?

1098
01:07:37,210 --> 01:07:38,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You get the door open yet?

1099
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:41,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I think we need another way in.

1100
01:07:41,850 --> 01:07:43,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK. I'll be there in a minute.

1101
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:51,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Congratulations.

1102
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:53,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You caught a kid.

1103
01:08:09,010 --> 01:08:11,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Enjoy the ride!

1104
01:08:16,790 --> 01:08:18,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now what?

1105
01:08:18,490 --> 01:08:20,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We give up.

1106
01:08:20,690 --> 01:08:22,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the only way we'll get the necklace back.

1107
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:24,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just follow my lead.

1108
01:08:26,030 --> 01:08:27,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hand over your weapons.

1109
01:08:35,410 --> 01:08:37,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All of your weapons.

1110
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:55,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OSS agents have been frozen in time.

1111
01:08:55,330 --> 01:08:58,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is there someone, anyone, out there that can save the day?

1112
01:08:58,630 --> 01:09:00,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello, Wilbur.

1113
01:09:00,230 --> 01:09:03,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, this is your dog, and I'm talking, but never mind about that now.

1114
01:09:03,970 --> 01:09:06,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rebecca and Cecil are in danger.

1115
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:08,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They've been captured by the Time Keeper and they need your help.

1116
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:13,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know it's hard to believe, sir, but you're their last hope.

1117
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:15,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd hurry if I were you.

1118
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:26,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's with the jazz hands? Huh, kiddies?

1119
01:10:26,650 --> 01:10:31,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My brother's hearing impaired. And your goon took his hearing aids.

1120
01:10:31,290 --> 01:10:33,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give him his hearing aids back. We're not monsters here.

1121
01:10:35,730 --> 01:10:38,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. You're only trying to end the world.

1122
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are you doing this?

1123
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:45,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Armageddon device was not meant to end the world or stop time.

1124
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:48,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was meant to travel back in time.

1125
01:10:48,710 --> 01:10:51,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To get me back to that.

1126
01:10:53,140 --> 01:10:56,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- My father. - Son, come here! Take a look at this.

1127
01:10:56,850 --> 01:10:59,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Wells Experiment was an early attempt to time travel.

1128
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:02,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's me before the accident.

1129
01:11:02,690 --> 01:11:06,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My father was working on the original prototype.

1130
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:10,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They were just about to test the machine when it went haywire.

1131
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:15,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He told me not to play near the lab.

1132
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:20,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I never listened.

1133
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:25,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It trapped me in time for so many years I almost lost count.

1134
01:11:26,510 --> 01:11:28,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were the Boy Frozen In Time.

1135
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:31,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My father spent his entire life...

1136
01:11:32,380 --> 01:11:33,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...trying to set me free.

1137
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:46,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I watched him grow old...

1138
01:11:47,830 --> 01:11:49,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and, eventually...

1139
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:52,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...die.

1140
01:11:53,740 --> 01:11:55,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The OSS shut down the experiment

1141
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:59,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with a solution that literally fell from the sky...

1142
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:00,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}... the Chronos Sapphire.

1143
01:12:04,150 --> 01:12:07,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When the effects wore off, I was a grown man in a boy's body.

1144
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:10,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All my friends were gone.

1145
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:12,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My father...

1146
01:12:13,590 --> 01:12:14,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...gone.

1147
01:12:14,890 --> 01:12:19,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everything and everyone I cared about was no more.

1148
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:22,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And all of this is so you can see your father again?

1149
01:12:22,770 --> 01:12:25,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want more time!

1150
01:12:26,740 --> 01:12:28,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With him.

1151
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:32,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He gave me everything.

1152
01:12:32,410 --> 01:12:34,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I couldn't even give him the time of day,

1153
01:12:34,510 --> 01:12:36,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because I didn't know...

1154
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:40,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...that our time would be so short together.

1155
01:12:41,650 --> 01:12:44,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But now when I go back, things are gonna be different.

1156
01:12:44,290 --> 01:12:46,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No, they won't. - Excuse me?

1157
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:48,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't actually travel through time.

1158
01:12:49,090 --> 01:12:50,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Time stays the same.

1159
01:12:50,890 --> 01:12:53,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're just creating multiple versions of yourself

1160
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:56,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that appear at different points in time.

1161
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:00,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's wrong. our plan will work.

1162
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:02,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've tried this before and failed.

1163
01:13:02,910 --> 01:13:05,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And my guess is that you've...

1164
01:13:06,110 --> 01:13:09,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...already gone back in time a lot.

1165
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:13,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This isn't the first time you've traveled back.

1166
01:13:13,980 --> 01:13:17,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And every time you return, you come back worse.

1167
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:23,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Each time, your plan fails.

1168
01:13:24,060 --> 01:13:25,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You try it again with another you.

1169
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:27,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But when are you going to learn...

1170
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...you can't change the past?

1171
01:13:29,830 --> 01:13:31,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You will only cause Armageddon.

1172
01:13:32,070 --> 01:13:36,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't listen to him. This time, it will work!

1173
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:39,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You will go back and you will have all the time in the world

1174
01:13:39,610 --> 01:13:41,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to spend with your father.

1175
01:13:41,610 --> 01:13:43,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Danger, when my mom died,

1176
01:13:44,010 --> 01:13:46,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it was the worst thing that could ever happen to me.

1177
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:48,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wished I had more time with her.

1178
01:13:49,220 --> 01:13:50,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There is no going back.

1179
01:13:51,690 --> 01:13:53,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honor the years you had with him.

1180
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:56,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Those brief...

1181
01:13:57,260 --> 01:13:59,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...special moments...

1182
01:13:59,660 --> 01:14:01,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...are the ones we'll remember.

1183
01:14:04,470 --> 01:14:06,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not about how much time you have.

1184
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:10,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's what you choose to do with it.

1185
01:14:10,340 --> 01:14:13,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}T minus 20 minutes until Armageddon.

1186
01:14:13,710 --> 01:14:16,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Time Vortex is opening!

1187
01:14:23,690 --> 01:14:25,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How'd you get outta my sand trap?

1188
01:14:25,390 --> 01:14:27,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With my bare hands.

1189
01:14:27,190 --> 01:14:29,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Actually, it was my Atomic Lipstick.

1190
01:14:30,590 --> 01:14:33,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keep away from my stepkids.

1191
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:35,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Make that your kids.

1192
01:14:36,830 --> 01:14:37,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right.

1193
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:40,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Make that your Spy Kids.

1194
01:14:42,270 --> 01:14:45,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stay away from my Spy Kids.

1195
01:14:45,810 --> 01:14:47,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Too late!

1196
01:15:00,390 --> 01:15:02,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It worked! It worked!

1197
01:15:03,030 --> 01:15:06,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everyone in the world is frozen except us.

1198
01:15:06,430 --> 01:15:07,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And us.

1199
01:15:11,170 --> 01:15:12,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Chronos!

1200
01:15:15,270 --> 01:15:18,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't let go of the watch or you'll freeze!

1201
01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:20,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have to use the necklace

1202
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:23,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to stop the Armageddon device once and for all!

1203
01:15:24,980 --> 01:15:26,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get into the Vortex.

1204
01:15:45,870 --> 01:15:48,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait, you don't have your Hammer Hands.

1205
01:15:48,910 --> 01:15:50,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't need Hammer Hands.

1206
01:16:00,820 --> 01:16:03,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah! - Cecil!

1207
01:16:23,670 --> 01:16:25,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Marissa gave that to me!

1208
01:16:32,950 --> 01:16:35,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Don't do it, Danger! - You can't bring back the past!

1209
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:37,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Time is the enemy of youth.

1210
01:16:37,990 --> 01:16:39,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm getting mine back.

1211
01:16:39,860 --> 01:16:41,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You won't change anything!

1212
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:14,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought you said nothing would change.

1213
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:16,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait for it.

1214
01:17:26,870 --> 01:17:28,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's that?

1215
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:29,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's Danger.

1216
01:17:38,380 --> 01:17:39,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were right.

1217
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:43,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't go back.

1218
01:17:45,290 --> 01:17:46,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I tried.

1219
01:17:47,790 --> 01:17:49,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My father still died...

1220
