是历史上最古老的吸血鬼

00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:05,200
也就是始祖家族
The Originals.

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,570
和他们不同的是 我是一个混血儿...一半吸血鬼 一半狼人
Unlike them, I am a hybrid...half vampire, half werewolf.

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:35,980
什么？
What?

21
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,140
Marcel来过
Marcel was here.

22
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,680
但我们错了
We were wrong.

23
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,130
女士们 先生们

欢迎参加格斗之夜...

格斗之夜的首要规则就是
And the first rule of fight night is,

00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:23,020
今夜过后还没倒下的吸血鬼

27
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,720
会离核心集团和一枚日光戒指...
is one step closer to the inner circle

28
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:29,810
更近一步
and one of these...a daylight ring.

29
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:33,450
如果你那小小的暴力行径能让我印象深刻的话
If you can impress me with a little ultra-violence,

30
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,570
你也可以享受到阳光洒在脸上的温暖
you too can enjoy the warmth of the sun on your face.

31
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:41,240
你只需要拿出真本事来
All you got to do is kick a little ass.

32
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,280
我们开始吧
So here we go.

33
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,780
欢迎我们的第一对竞争者...
Our first two contenders...

34
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:54,170
Felicia和Otto
Felicia and Otto.

35
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,210
呼！该死的 小妞 挺厉害嘛
Whoo! Damn, girl, not bad.

36
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:41,270
晚上好 我想说几句
Good evening. I'd like a word.

37
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,800
你来这里干什么？
What do you think you're doing?

38
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,400
似乎我们打扰了
It appears that we've interrupted

39
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,170
一群脏兮兮的业余拳击手
a collection of filthy amateurs.

40
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,200
我们来这里找那个女孩子
We've come here for the girl.

41
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,480
把她交给我们 否则...我们会杀得这里片甲不留
Give her to us,or...We kill everyone here.

42
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,490
先拿你开刀 
starting with you

43
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:01,600
你们两个神经病
You two got a lot of nerve

44
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,460
闯进我的家里 要东要西的 
coming into my home and making demands.

45
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,960
你家 呵呵？
Your home, is it?

46
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,290
我们要那个女孩 别让我再说一遍
The girl. I will not ask again.

47
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,460
我猜你们指的是Hayley...
I assume you're talking about Hayley...

48
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:15,170
这么高 深色头发 态度死贱
yay high, dark hair, bitchy attitude.

49
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,970
她到底是谁？
Who is she, anyway?

50
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:18,590
一位老朋友
She's an old friend.

51
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:22,010
你知道我对老朋友的感情有多深
You know how sentimental I am about old friends.

52
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:23,930
好吧 她不在我这
Well, I ain't got her,

53
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:26,010
你们先别忙着唠叨
and before you start whining,

54
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:28,150
昨天晚上我的确拜访过她
I did pay her a little visit last night.

55
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,820
因为突然有点怀旧
I was feeling nostalgic.

56
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,120
所以我回了一趟
So I took a trip out to the plantation

57
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,650
我曾做过奴隶的种植园
where I used to be a slave,

58
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:38,700
当我发现
and imagine my surprise when I realized

59
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,080
吸血鬼始祖家族竟然住在那里
that the original family of vampires

60
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,450
我简直惊呆了
had taken up residence.

61
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,980
你家Hayley开了门
Your girl Hayley answered the door.

62
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,830
我们相互问候了一下 就这样 
We exchanged hellos.That was it.

63
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,790
如果你不相信我 你可以自己找
You don't believe me, look around.

64
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,370
见鬼 我甚至还会帮你们找到她
Hell, I'll even help you find her,

65
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,840
但我想问的是
but the question I'd ask is,

66
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,040
如果Hayley不在这里
if Hayley isn't here,

67
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,800
那她能去哪里呢？
then where is she?

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,200
开玩笑吧？
Seriously?

69
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,000
Tyler?
Tyler?

70
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,300
Hayley 你不会想跟我打上一架的
You don't want to fight me, Hayley.

71
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,420
你知道你赢不了一个混血儿的
You know you can't beat a hybrid.

72
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,090
啊！放我走
Aah! Let me go,

73
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:45,670
你这个暗箭伤人的混血杂种  一坨...
you backstabbing, half-breed piece of sh...

74
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,510
你丫闭嘴！
shut up!

75
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:59,000
始祖家族

76
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:59,000
第一季第七集

77
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,800
也就是一帮乌合之众
Not the most attractive community,

78
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,070
你觉得呢？
are they?

79
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,690
你知道他们能听见你说的话
You do realize they can hear you.

80
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:04,110
你知道我根本不会在乎
You do realize I don't care.

81
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:08,610
Elijah 我还是更喜欢待在棺材里的你
You know, Elijah, I liked you better in that box,

82
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,450
但是 Klaus 我的恩师 我亏欠你太多
but, Klaus, my sire, you I owe the world,

83
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:14,750
而且我向来尊师敬道
and I always show respect to my elders.

84
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,170
如果你的特殊女友失踪了
If your special lady friend is missing,

85
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:19,370
可以让女巫来帮你们
you can benefit from the help of a witch,

86
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,380
既然我掌控着这个城市的女巫们
and since I control all the witches in this town,

87
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,180
我允许你们用一个小小的定位咒
I'll Grant you one little locator spell.

88
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,330
Sabine是法语区最好的导游
Sabine is the best guide in the quarter.

89
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,270
如果你们想找到什么人
You need to find someone,

90
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:32,350
我保证她可以帮到你们
I guarantee she's your girl.

91
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,560
你要去哪里？
Where are you going?

92
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,530
我讨厌长话短说 但太阳很快就要升起
I hate to cut this short, but the sun is coming up soon.

93
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:39,140
我的夜行者们必须得进屋里
My nightwalkers need to get inside,

94
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,900
而且还有一个城市要打理
and I've got a city to run.

95
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,020
我就不陪你们寻找迷途羔羊了
I'll leave you to track down your lost sheep.

96
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,270
你能找到她吗？
Can you find her?

97
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,910
我尽量
I can try.

98
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,170
这是什么地方？
What is this place?

99
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:09,930
路易斯安那的一个小旮旯
The armpit of Louisiana.

100
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,980
你拿着刀想干嘛？
What are you gonna do with that?

101
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,600
这取决于你
Depends on you.

102
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,350
嘿 是你攻击我的 还记得吗？
Hey, you attacked me, remember?

103
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:19,020
你在我家后院伏击了我
You ambushed me in my own back yard.

104
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,440
那不是你家的后院 那是Klaus家的后院
It's not your back yard.It's Klaus'.

105
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,910
你和那个神经病住在一个宅邸里
You're shacked up in a mansion with that psycho,

106
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,770
已经不再是我在阿巴拉契亚山脉遇到的那个
a long way from the girl I met in the appalachians

107
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,280
帮助过很多狼人的女孩子
helping other werewolves.

108
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,610
Tyler 对不起 自从最后一次见到你之后
Tyler, I'm sorry, but a lot has happened

109
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,330
发生了很多事情
since the last time I saw you.

110
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:34,120
你想说的是你怎么怀孕的？
You mean like how you're pregnant?

111
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,090
一个神奇混血宝宝 没错 我都知道了
A hybrid baby. Yeah. I know all about it.

112
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,790
我一直行走于河口一带
I've been roaming around the bayou

113
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,620
打探各种消息
asking questions.

114
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,590
我来告诉你我都打听到了什么
Let me tell you what I learned.

115
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,260
这个月牙状胎记意味着
This crescent birthmark means you come

116
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,880
你来自大家族 对这个地区的狼人而言
from a big shot family, some kind of royalty

117
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,550
你的家族就是王族
to the werewolves of this region,

118
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,970
就在这里
and right here,

119
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:56,520
这儿就是那个家族的遗迹了
this is all that's left of them.

120
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,310
嘿 救救我
Hey, help me.

121
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,230
他们救不了你
They can't help you.

122
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,990
他们躲在丛林里
They're in the woods hiding

123
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,200
因为数十年来
because they've been persecuted

124
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:13,870
他们被吸血鬼所迫害
for decades by vampires.

125
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:17,580
是她吗？
Is that her?

126
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:21,450
是的 Dwayne 把她带进去
Yeah, Dwayne. Get her inside.

127
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:23,880
Tyler? 
Tyler?

128
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:35,390
她在荒郊野外
She's in the back country,

129
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,250
从霍马向里一直走到河口深处
way out past houma, deep in the bayou.

130
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,630
我也没指望你能查得更具体
I don't suppose you could be more precise.

131
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:41,650
怎么了 Elijah
What's the matter, Elijah,

132
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:43,190
你在担心沼泽地的泥
are you worried a bit suppose of splashing about in the bog

133
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,320
会毁了你昂贵的鞋子吗？
might ruin your expensive shoes?

134
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,360
事实上 前阵子被监禁这么久
As a matter of fact, after my recent confinement,

135
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,570
我需要在乡间优雅的散个步
I could use a decent stroll through the countryside.

136
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,440
营地那里流传着
There are stories of exiled werewolves,

137
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:55,160
被驱逐的狼族的故事
encampments.

138
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,370
如果Hayley真的走那么远
If Hayley went out that far,

139
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,280
有可能 她去找他们了
chances are, she went to find them.

140
00:07:58,290 --> 00:07:59,700
显而易见 她一直希望结识
Clearly, she hopes to make the acquaintance

141
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,290
狼人族群
of more like herself.

142
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:04,660
我猜是我们家对她照顾的不够好
I suppose our company wasn't good enough for her.

143
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,230
你也可以随时加入他们 你懂的
You could always join them, you know.

144
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:28,810
呃 饮酒游戏
Uh, drinking games.

145
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,700
这不是我的菜
It's not really my thing.

146
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,240
总让我想起高中时候的恶棍
It kind of reminds me of the jocks in my High School.

147
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,690
那会儿太多人喜欢拿管子灌人鼻子
We had a pretty high quota of what you'd call

148
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:37,620
就是你们说的鼻冲洗嘴管
douche nozzles.

149
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,580
-恶霸 哈？ -是啊
Bullies, huh? Yeah.

150
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,990
真想瞧瞧你现在看到那些家伙会怎么样
Wonder what'd happen if you saw those guys now.

151
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,030
我打赌你会把他们撕碎 对吧？
I bet you'd tear them apart, right?

152
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,830
是啊 完全如此
Ah, yeah, totally.

153
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,340
哈 可能会像吸血鬼忍者那样
Ha! Probably go all vamp ninja on them.

154
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,640
哈哈哈 Josh你真是一个有趣的人
Ha ha ha! You're a funny guy, Josh.

155
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,810
实际上 我觉得昨晚
In fact, I thought it was really

156
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:59,340
真的很有趣 你知道吗
funny last night, you know,

157
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,050
看到你出现在
seeing you at that plantation

158
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:04,850
Klaus住的种植园
where Klaus is staying.

159
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:08,240
哦吼 哇哈哈！
Ho ho! Ha ha ha!

160
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,390
Josh 要去哪么？
You going somewhere, Josh?

161
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,030
我们应该朝向水流走 往南去
We should head south towards the water.

162
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,530
你决心要找到小狼妞啊
You seem quite determined to find the little wolf.

163
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:20,920
Niklaus 如果你嫌我行动太快的话
If I'm moving too fast for you, Niklaus,

164
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,920
大可以在车里等着
you're welcome to wait in the car.

165
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,200
不过要确保把车窗都摇下来
Do be certain to leave the windows down.

166
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:27,420
啊 看来我提到敏感话题了
Ah, so I've touched a nerve.

167
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,670
你已经开始爱慕这个女孩了
You've begun to admire this girl.

168
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,590
也许这就是为什么从你回来起
Perhaps that's why you've been barking orders

169
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,960
一直发号施令
since your return, hoping to impress Hayley

170
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,100
就为了给Hayley留下好印象
by assuming the role of family patriarch.

171
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,180
如果你坚持把她当作
You want to insist on treating her

172
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,270
一个会行走的恒温箱
like a walking incubator,

173
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:41,690
那你就错了
then that's your mistake.

174
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:45,310
你闻到她的气味了吗？
Have you found her scent?

175
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:48,440
没有
No...

176
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:51,150
但我闻到了其他人的
But I found someone else's.

177
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,650
这辆车散发着他的臭味
This vehicle reeks

178
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:57,940
我以为已经摆脱了他
of someone I thought I was rid of...

179
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,910
Tyler Lockwood
Tyler Lockwood.

180
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,990
为什么你那个神秘瀑布镇的混血小伙伴
And why would your little hybrid sidekick

181
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,130
会对Hayley感兴趣呢？
from Mystic Falls have any interest in Hayley?

182
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:09,200
因为我追求过他的女朋友 而他想报仇
He wants revenge because I went after his girl.

183
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,840
为什么我觉得这是你最不起眼的错误呢？
Why do I suspect this is the least of your offenses?

184
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,120
在我有办法让混血认祖归宗的时候
Back when I had the means to sire hybrids,

185
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,100
他是我第一个混血
he was my first,

186
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:22,140
虽然在这件事上我没有给他多少选择
although I didn't give him much choice in the matter.

187
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,930
他一开始很忠诚
He was loyal in the beginning,

188
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:26,650
但后来越来越不听话
but he grew insubordinate,

189
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:28,270
还让其他混血都和我作对
turned my other hybrids against me.

190
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,440
我不能容忍
I couldn't have that.

191
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,800
所以我把他们都杀了
So I massacred the lot of them.

192
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,080
在我要了结他之前
Tyler ran like a coward

193
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,780
Tyler像懦夫一样跑了
before I could finish him off.

194
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:43,250
你还有其他什么要分享的吗？
Anything else that you would like to share?

195
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,000
那个 还有他妈妈的事
Well, there was this business with his mum.

196
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,260
你杀了他妈妈 真棒
You killed his mother.Wonderful.

197
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,040
是他需要得到教训啊
He needed to be taught a lesson.

198
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,430
那你要得到什么教训呢 Niklaus
And what lesson will you be taught, Niklaus,

199
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:56,460
如果他为了报复你而伤害Hayley呢？
if he retaliates by harming Hayley?

200
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:00,430
所以你的确喜欢她 好吧 那你去啊
So you do care about her. Well, go on, then.

201
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:02,020
去吧 哥哥 去救她
Have at it, brother. Save her.

202
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,390
我看你能把她宠成什么样
Claim what spoils you can.

203
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,640
她的一切我早就尝过鲜了
I've sampled what she has to offer,

204
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,770
还有 让我告诉你 她可是妙不可言呢
and, let me tell you, she is exquisite.

205
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,190
Niklaus 帮我...
Niklaus, so help me...

206
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:10,810
够了
enough.

207
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:14,180
我会亲手杀了Tyler Lockwood
I'll kill Tyler Lockwood myself.

208
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,930
Marcel 有情况
Marcel, something is happening.

209
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:28,430
法语区有女巫在施法
There's a witch doing magic in the quarter.

210
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,570
不用担心 那个是经我认可的
Oh, no worries. That one is Marcel-approved.

211
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:32,600
-另外... -哦！
Besides...Oh!

212
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:35,570
你得处理另外一件事
Got something else for you to handle.

213
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:45,450
哦天呐 你是那个超级女巫
Oh, no. You're the super witch.

214
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,480
和Josh打个招呼
Say hi to Josh.

215
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:49,420
你把他带来干嘛？
Why would you bring him here?

216
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,040
Josh有麻烦了
Josh has a problem.

217
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,120
Klaus控制他来监视我
Klaus compelled him to spy on me.

218
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,660
啊！
Agh!

219
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,090
我绝对不允许
I can't have that.

220
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,430
所以我想 杀了Josh就行
So I thought,"I'll just kill Josh."

221
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:00,600
Marcel 求你了 这不是我的错
Marcel, please. It's not my fault.

222
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,100
但我又想到 杀掉一个吸血鬼
Then I thought,"killing a vampire,

223
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,830
就会违反我自己的规则
that would be breaking my own rule."

224
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,770
所以聪明的做法就是给Josh洗脑
Smart thing to do is to flip Josh.

225
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:08,270
这样他就可以告诉Klaus我想让他说的一切
That way, he can tell Klaus whatever I want.

226
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,890
他甚至可以帮我监视Klaus
He could even spy for me.

227
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:12,110
我们要做的就是解除Klaus的意念操纵
All we got to do is wipe away that compulsion.

228
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:14,480
你觉得怎么样？
So what do you think?

229
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,650
我可以让他忘了Klaus告诉他的事情
I can make him forget what Klaus told him,

230
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:18,780
但Klaus命令的越多
but the more Klaus said,

231
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,480
就会疼得越厉害
the more it's gonna hurt.

232
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,540
嗯...那可能会很疼呢
Hmm, probably gonna hurt a lot.

233
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,710
Josh？
Josh？

234
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,710
我会配合的
I'll do it,

235
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:30,490
随便怎样都行
anything, yes.

236
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,960
我们说的痛苦到底是什么程度呢？
How much pain are we talking?

237
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,700
Tyler 最近一直有只狼在盯着我
Tyler, there's been a wolf watching me lately.

238
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:57,500
就像它本来就知道我是他们中的一员似的保护我
Protecting me like it instinctively knows that I'm part of its pack.

239
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,900
你是混血儿 你可以随时变成狼人
You're a hybrid. You can turn into a wolf whenever you want.

240
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:02,900
那是你么？
Was it you?

241
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,500
不是
No.

242
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,800
但你说的对
But you're right.

243
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,900
只有混血儿才能控制自己在何时变身
Only hybrids can control when they change.

244
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,200
我是除了Klaus之外唯一剩下的混血儿了
And I'm the only one left besides Klaus,

245
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,700
这就是我们在这里的原因
which is why we're here.

246
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,600
不管你怎么想 怎么做
Whatever you think you're doing, you know,

247
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,900
整个始祖家族已经达成某种协议
get a whole original family has made some sort of pack

248
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,500
来保护我和我的孩子平安无事
or something to keep me and the baby safe.

249
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,800
如果你伤害我 他们会杀了你的
So if you hurt me, they'll kill you.

250
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,400
是什么让你觉得我会怕死呢
What makes you think I'm afraid to die.

251
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,500
准备好了么？
you're ready for this?

252
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,000
动手吧
let's do it.

253
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,000
你要干什么？
What are you doing?

254
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,200
Tyler 求你了 别 Tyler！
Tyler, please, no, Tyler!

255
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,430
Klaus 毁了我生命里所有美好的东西
Klaus destroyed everything good in my life.

256
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,740
所以我要夺走他最想要的
So I'm gonna take away the thing he wants most.

257
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,970
不要 求你了 Tyler 不要这样
No, please, Tyler, please.

258
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:32,180
我以为你走了 离不开家是吗？
I thought you were leaving town. Couldn't stay away, huh?

259
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,150
我本来已经过了半个路易斯安那州了
I was half past Louisiana when I found out

260
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,350
结果我发现你入侵了我家
you invaded our home.

261
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:37,150
你对Hayley做了什么？
What have you done with Hayley?

262
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:41,380
你生气的时候真性感
You're so hot when you're angry.

263
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,830
啊！
Uh!

264
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,760
你利用了我
You used me.

265
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,510
我很肯定这是相互的
I'm pretty sure that was mutual.

266
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:52,020
被你迷昏了头 我像傻子一样和你睡了 
Beguiled by your charms, I slept with you like a fool,

267
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,550
把你带到我家 然后你就抓走了Hayley
led you to our home, and then you took Hayley.

268
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,940
哇哦 我谁都没抓
Whoa, I didn't take anybody.

269
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,360
我已经和你的哥哥们弄清这件事了
I already sorted this out with your brothers,

270
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,740
别回避问题
but it begs the question,

271
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,030
你为什么回来？
why'd you come back?

272
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,360
如果Klaus知道你找到去种植园的路
If Klaus learns it's my fault

273
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,830
是因为我的过失...
you found your way to the plantation...

274
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,700
你真的认为我会出卖你吗？
you really think I'd rat you out?

275
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,030
拜托
Come on.

276
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,750
如果你真的认为在一千年中我做出过
If you think that I'd ever in 1,000 years

277
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,000
任何伤害你的事
do anything to hurt you,

278
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:17,040
你就把我错当成Klaus了
you got me confused with Klaus.

279
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,740
你所有的魅力和挑逗
All your charmsand flirtations

280
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,200
仅仅证明你和Klaus一样
simply prove you're every bit the liar

281
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,630
是个不折不扣的骗子和操控者
and manipulator that Klaus is.

282
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,050
你真是这么想的吗？
Is that what you really think?

283
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:31,050
那就想尽办法证明我错了
By all means, prove me wrong.

284
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:34,970
好吧 跟我来
Fine. Come on.

285
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:38,950
有些东西要你看
Something you need to see.

286
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,360
别用这种评判的眼光
Don't get all judgey.

287
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,110
Dwayne知道他在做什么
Dwayne knew what he was getting into.

288
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,580
他是自愿的
He volunteered.

289
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,210
自愿让你杀了他？
For you to kill him?

290
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:57,830
他是狼人 死的时候体内有你的血
Dwayne is a werewolf who died with your blood in his system,

291
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:01,170
和你的混血孩子一样的血
same blood you share with your hybrid baby.

292
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,600
你在试着把他变成个混血
You're trying to turn him into a hybrid.

293
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,060
那是不可能的
That's impossible.

294
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,340
我一直和全国的狼群打交道
Been running with wolf packs all over the country.

295
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,630
和其中一个女巫联系很紧密
One of them was tight with a witch.

296
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,530
她对你的宝宝有噩梦般的预见
She had nightmare visions about your baby

297
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:13,760
Klaus会用他的血
and how Klaus could use its blood

298
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,130
来建造一支混血奴隶军团
to make an army of hybrid slaves.

299
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:17,100
我对这些女巫
I am sick of these witches

300
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,100
和她们对我孩子的预见感到恶心
and the premonitions about my baby.

301
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,640
它只是一个孩子
It's just a baby.

302
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,690
也许是 也许不是
Maybe. Maybe not.

303
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:25,310
这就是为什么Dwayne要来这
That's where Dwayne comes in.

304
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:27,310
你看 他很乐意成为试验对象
You see, he was happy to be the test case.

305
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:28,480
如果你还没注意到 这些人
If you haven't noticed, these people

306
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,860
活着没什么盼头
don't have much to live for.

307
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,150
他们都期待成为
They'd all welcome the chance to become

308
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,780
更优良的物种
the superior species.

309
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:36,870
问题是 所有的混血都对Klaus认祖归宗
Trouble is, all hybrids are sired to Klaus.

310
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:40,040
他们对他言听计从
They follow his every move.

311
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,130
我不会让这一切发生的
No way I'd let that happen.

312
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:47,000
你怎么就这么确定Klaus知道
How can you be so sure Klaus knows

313
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,770
这孩子的血能做什么？
what the baby's blood will do?

314
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,180
你怎么想的？
What do you think?

315
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:51,550
Klaus Mikaelson..
Klaus Mikaelson...

316
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,890
他杀过无数男人 女人 还有小狗之类的生灵
killer of men, women, and puppies...

317
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:54,390
却突然间想做父亲了
all of a sudden wants to be a daddy,

318
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:58,470
或者说他根本就另有不可告人的目的
or he's got an ulterior motive.

319
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,310
混血可以在阳光下行走
Hybrids can walk in the sun.

320
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,450
他们的咬伤对吸血鬼来说是致命的
Their bite is lethal to vampires.

321
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,230
一个星期他们就能掌控整个新奥尔良
They'll take over New Orleans by the end of the week,

322
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:07,450
而你知道怎样才能阻止Klaus吗？
and you know what's gonna stop Klaus then?

323
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:09,540
怎样都不能
Nothing.

324
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,660
你必须得吸她的血
You're gonna have to feed on her.

325
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,200
什么？不
What? No.

326
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,200
啊..
Aah...

327
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,700
动手啊
do it.

328
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,810
不！不！啊！
No. No! Aah!

329
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,800
Dwayne…放松
Dwayne... easy.

330
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,300
看着我 看着我
Look at me. Look at me.

331
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,000
你没事了
You're ok.

332
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,700
我不是没事 是好极了
I'm better than ok.

333
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,440
我很抱歉 但是你这样只会更糟
I'm sorry, but it's just gonna get worse.

334
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,490
Klaus的催眠太深了
Klaus' compulsion runs deep.

335
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:34,000
你需要想点别的
You need to think of something else,

336
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,200
别再想这些了
take your mind off it.

337
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,400
你喜欢音乐吗？
Do you like music?

338
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,000
什么？什么？
What? What?

339
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,100
我现在没心思想音乐
I can't think about music right now.

340
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,200
为什么？我不明白
Why? I don't know.

341
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,900
可能因为你在用巫毒给我洗脑
Maybe because you're giving me a voodoo lobotomy.

342
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,400
你喜欢爵士乐吗？
Do you like jazz?

343
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,300
唉...
Oh...

344
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,370
那你喜欢什么？
So what, then?

345
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:01,020
俱乐部里的东西吧...
Club stuff...

346
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,900
大房间 迷幻舞曲 你懂的...
house, trance, you know...

347
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,120
嗯呲嗒呲……
nn ss nn ss nn ss 

348
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,020
我是女巫 又不是阿米什人
I'm a witch. I'm not amish.

349
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:11,200
因为我才十六岁 不去俱乐部的
It's just I'm only 16. I don't go to clubs.

350
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,400
我十六岁的时候早就混迹各种俱乐部了
When I was 16, I'd been to like, 100 clubs.

351
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,920
天呐 才过去四年
God, it was only 4 years ago.

352
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:29,050
感觉却像是上辈子
Feels like another life.

353
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:34,600
我当时只是想多见一些男孩 
All I wanted to do was meet boys.

354
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,840
可这一切却复杂多了 
Things are so much more complicated.

355
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,510
现在我还是想见男孩
I mean, now all I want to do is meet boys

356
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:44,840
但是为了吸他们的血
and feed on people's blood,

357
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,230
得到一个日光戒
get one of those daylight rings

358
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:51,120
那样我就不会在阳光下烧死
so I don't burn in the sunlight,

359
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,000
就能像个普通人一样
all perfectly normal things.

360
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,990
我爱古典音乐...
I like the classics...

361
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,880
波切尼 巴赫 莫扎特
puccini, bach, Mozart.

362
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,920
我练过钢琴
I took piano,

363
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:10,570
但我困在这里 没有机会弹琴了
not that it matters while I'm stuck here.

364
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:12,720
为什么不弹？
Why not?

365
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,730
Marcel担心有人会听见
Marcel is worried that someone could hear.

366
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:20,980
这不怪他
It's not his fault.

367
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:24,400
他只是想保护我
He just wants to keep me safe.

368
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,740
保护你什么？
Safe from what?

369
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:29,890
大体来说 就是一帮疯狂的女巫们
Basically, a coven of psycho witches

370
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:32,290
想在血祭仪式上杀掉我
want to sacrifice me in a blood ritual.

371
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:36,360
噢 哇噢 好吧
Oh, wow. Ok.

372
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,450
啊...很抱歉...
Uh, I'm...Sorry.

373
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:43,740
别担心 我会把她们一网打尽
Don't be. I'm gonna destroy them all,

374
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,250
等到她们都消失了
and once they're gone,

375
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:48,170
一切又会回到正轨
everything will go back to normal.

376
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,590
我会继续我原来的生活
I'll have my old life back.

377
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:02,870
成功了 对不对？他是个混血了
It worked, didn't it? He's a hybrid.

378
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,370
如果你落到Klaus手里
If Klaus gets a hold of you,

379
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:07,640
如果他掌控着这个孩子 他就赢了
if he gets that kid, he wins.

380
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:12,390
那就帮我把孩子藏起来
Then help me hide the baby from him.

381
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,510
帮我逃走
Help me run.

382
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:16,430
他会找到你的
He'll find you.

383
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:17,770
他会带走你的孩子
He'll take your kid away,

384
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:19,930
他会制造更多的混血怪物
and he'll make more hybrid monsters,

385
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,770
一帮完全听命于他的奴隶
slaves who do everything he says.

386
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:24,490
Tyler 无论你想要做什么
Tyler, whatever you're thinking of doing,

387
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:25,940
一定还有其他办法的
there has to be another way.

388
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:28,830
你不是这样的人
You're not like this.

389
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:36,500
啊！这样很蠢！
Agh! That was stupid.

390
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,450
离她远点
Get away from her.

391
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:39,840
关你屁事？
What do you care?

392
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,900
我说了 走开
I said, get away.

393
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,290
你已经得到你想要的 滚开 
You got what you wanted. Now get lost.

394
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:44,910
Dwayne 他要杀了我
Dwayne, he's gonna kill me.

395
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,380
他还要杀了你
He's gonna kill you, too.

396
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,580
他说混血儿活着
He said that hybrids

397
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,100
太危险了
are too dangerous to live.

398
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,100
你必须阻止他
You need to stop him.

399
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,680
闭嘴！哦！
Shut up. Uh!

400
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:27,890
原谅我
Forgive me.

401
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:30,050
还以为你有危险
Thought you were in danger.

402
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:33,640
看来我错了
It appears I was mistaken.

403
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:43,230
你绝对想不到我今天有多衰
You will not believe the crap day that I'm having.

404
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:47,990
我带你回家
Let me take you home.

405
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:49,440
Elijah…
Elijah…

406
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:56,750
关于这个孩子你还需要多了解一些
There's something you need to know about the baby.

407
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,170
Hayley.
Hayley.

408
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:00,870
别让这一切变得更加艰难
don't make this harder than it has to be.

409
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,120
放弃吧...
Give up now...

410
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:08,680
我会很快解决的
I'll end it quick.

411
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,490
说的真好
Quite an offer,

412
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,600
不过我是不会这么跟你说的
though not one I'll be extending to you.

413
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,550
Klaus
Klaus

414
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:19,520
嘿 Tyler 你看上去不错
Hello, Tyler.You look well.

415
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,070
不过我打算改变一下
I aim to change that.

416
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:30,640
威胁一个怀孕的女孩
Threatening a pregnant girl

417
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,840
就为了报复我
in order to exact revenge against me.

418
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,640
我还从没想到过你会堕落至此
I never expected you to sink so low.

419
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,650
我承认 我很有感触
I admit, I'm impressed.

420
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:41,850
我过去常跟着你混
I used to hang out with you.

421
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:43,570
不过我想那些事情已经一去不复返了
I guess something must have rubbed off.

422
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:45,490
你觉得Caroline会怎么想呢
What do you think Caroline would say

423
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,650
如果她看到你变成这样？
if she saw what you've become?

424
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,020
也许在我告知她你死讯的时候
Perhaps I'll ask her when I call her

425
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:52,160
会顺便问问
to tell her of your demise.

426
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,990
不管我发什么了什么
Whatever happens to me,

427
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,160
Caroline绝对不会停止恨你的
Caroline is never gonna stop hating you.

428
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:02,540
来吧 伙计 再拼命点
Come on, mate. Give it a bit more effort.

429
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,540
让我玩个痛快
I want to enjoy myself.

430
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,550
这是什么地方？
What is this place?

431
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:26,120
这是个花园
This is the garden.

432
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,810
是我用来惩罚那些违反我规矩的吸血鬼的地方
It's where I punish vampires who break my rules,

433
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:33,810
但很久以前 这里有别的用途
but a long time ago, used to be something else.

434
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:41,350
说说吧 告诉我你看到了什么
Go on. Tell me what you see.

435
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,520
双层结构 希腊式的圆柱
Two stories, Greek columns,

436
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:49,160
环绕式门廊 高高的天花板
wraparound porch, high ceilings,

437
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,240
还有顶窗
transom windows.

438
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:54,530
很漂亮 那又怎样？
It's lovely. So what?

439
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:59,370
这是我为你设计的 原本将是我们的家
So I designed it for you. It was gonna be ours.

440
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,660
那…
That...

441
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:11,130
这本应该是我们共度美好生活的地方？
this was supposed to be our happily ever after?

442
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:13,330
你和我的
Yours and mine,

443
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,500
如果你没有跟着Klaus逃走的话
except you flew the coop with Klaus.

444
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,890
我已经为这个地方打好了地基
I already built the foundation for the place.

445
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:20,170
你离开后就停工了
I halted construction after you took off.

446
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,390
我打算等你回来再继续
Plan was to wait for you to return.

447
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:23,890
但你没有
You never did.

448
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:27,250
所以这里成了我埋藏那些背叛我的人的地方
So now it's where I bury the people who betray me.

449
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:28,680
你那时应该跟我走的
You could've come after me.

450
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,020
你和Klaus在一起 我不知道你在哪
You were with Klaus. I didn't know where.

451
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,240
也不知道你还想不想和我在一起
I didn't know if you still wanted to be with me.

452
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,670
你当时需要做的就是回家
All you had to do was come home.

453
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:36,210
这比你想的要复杂得多
It was more complicated than that.

454
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:37,370
我们离开这没多久
Not long after we left here,

455
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,540
他就拿匕首扎进了我的心脏
he put a dagger in my heart

456
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,380
然后把我封在棺材里九十年
and stuck me in a box for 90 years.

457
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,750
他偷走我一个世纪的光阴 好像对他都不算什么
He stole a century from me like it were nothing.

458
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,450
这就是他 Rebekah
That's what he does, Rebekah.

459
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:45,970
Klaus永远都不会开心的
Klaus will never be happy.

460
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:47,200
如果有人得到了他得不到的
He'll be damned if he ever lets anyone

461
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,750
他会变得非常凶残
get something that he can't have.

462
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,870
我知道
I know.

463
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:50,990
我已经跟着他的节奏
I've been dancing to this song

464
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,370
活了一千年
for 1,000 years.

465
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:55,560
从现在开始 你还有一个选择
Starting right now, you have a choice

466
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,510
在一个随心所欲 任意剥夺你的快乐
between the brother who takes away your happiness

467
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,810
的哥哥和一个想给你
whenever he feels like it and the man who wants

468
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:02,270
全世界的男人之间做出选择
to give you everything you ever wanted.

469
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:10,220
他会当着我的面杀了你
He will kill you in front of my eyes

470
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:12,240
为了泄恨
out of spite.

471
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,610
如果我们先摆脱他就不一定了
Not if we get rid of him first.

472
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:21,080
Klaus肯定已经知道了
Klaus must have known.

473
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:24,040
这是唯一的解释
That's the only explanation.

474
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,540
他一点也不在乎这个孩子
He could care less about the baby.

475
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,910
他只是想让孩子生下来
He just wants her to be born

476
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:29,630
这样他就能制造更多的混血儿
so he can use her to make more sired hybrids.

477
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:35,920
尽管Dwayne表现出来的
Although the way that Dwayne was acting,

478
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:39,470
更像是对我认祖归宗了
it was more like he was sired to me.

479
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:44,760
我应该带你回家
I should take you home.

480
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:48,030
开什么玩笑？哪里是家？
Are you serious? Home to what?

481
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,810
听着 不管我弟弟的意图如何
Look. Regardless of my brother's intentions,

482
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,600
我始终如一
mine remain the same.

483
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,870
我说过会保护你
I said that I would protect you,

484
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:56,490
就算是Klaus想伤害你也不行
even, if need be, from Klaus himself.

485
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:59,270
我可以自己照顾自己
I can take care of myself.

486
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:01,290
我一直都是靠自己的
I've done it for a long time.

487
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,960
这就是你的复仇计划吗 Tyler？
Is this your idea of revenge, Tyler,

488
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:08,750
累人的捉迷藏游戏？
grueling game of hide-and-seek?


















489
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:24,010
不如我们来做个了结吧
Let's end this, shall we?

490
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:27,020
呀！呀！
Raagh! Raagh!

491
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,820
你狗胆包天？
How dare you?

492
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,740
这才刚刚开始
I'm just getting started.

493
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:45,320
啊！
Aagh!

494
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,080
你已经开始饥渴了
You've grown bloodthirsty.

495
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,990
也许你该庆幸你母亲没有活着
Perhaps it's best your mother didn't live

496
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,450
看到你这个样子
to see you like this.

497
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:53,080
哈哈哈！
Ha ha ha!

498
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:03,410
真是可悲
It's sad, really.

499
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:05,790
我本以为我把你变得更好
I thought I made you better.

500
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,630
没想到你却让人失望
Turns out, you're quite the disappointment.

501
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,930
呀！
Yaah!

502
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:13,100
我猜我只不过是你另一个失败品而已
I guess I'm another one of your failures,

503
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,850
就像你制造混血最终失败一样
like how you failed at making hybrids,

504
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,890
就像你让你的家人失望一样
how you failed your family.

505
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:21,780
现在看起来你甚至可能
Now it looks like you're even

506
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:24,810
要让你自己的孩子失望了
gonna fail your own kid.

507
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:28,650
那就这样终结你乏味又渺小的一生吧
And thus ends your tedious, little life.

508
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:30,450
至少它不会耗时太久
At least it was brief.

509
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:32,700
呀！啊！！
Yaagh! Ugh...

510
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,280
杀了我吧
Do it.

511
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,050
你永远不会毁掉我的
You're never gonna break me.

512
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:41,660
你唯一能做的就是杀了我
Only thing you could do is kill me.

513
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:46,130
来吧  杀了我  让一切都结束
So go on. Go on. Get it over with.

514
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,670
啊…
Ah...

515
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:53,310
你想让我结束你的痛苦  是吗？
You want me to end your suffering, don't you?

516
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:58,230
嗯？我确实毁掉了你  夺走了你的一切
Hmm? I did break you, took everything from you,

517
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:00,970
而现在你又祈求我结束你那
and now you're begging me to sweep away the shards

518
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:04,020
破碎渺小的生命
of your shattered, little life.

519
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,420
让你死就太便宜你了
Death offers more peace than you deserve.

520
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,500
更好的方式是让你生不如死
It's better to let you live,

521
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,650
每个清晨你醒来就会意识到
and each morning, you will wake knowing

522
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:23,510
你这样卑微的活着
that your wretched existence continues

523
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:27,090
仅仅是由于我的施舍
only by my will.

524
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:31,350
现在你走吧  去享受你剩下的日子吧
Now go and live the rest of your days

525
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:36,550
你要知道你对我来说什么都不是
knowing you are nothing to me.

526
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,090
你知道曾经有多少傻子试图要
Do you know how many fools have tried

527
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,700
战胜我哥哥么?
to vanquish my brother?

528
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,780
如果你和他对立  他会杀了你
If you stand against him, he will kill you,

529
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,730
那种可怕又血腥的场面
and it will be awful and bloody,

530
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:53,020
我绝对不会旁观的
and I will not stand around and watch.

531
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:56,960
你忘了我有一个秘密武器…Davina
You forget I have a secret weapon... Davina,

532
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,410
是几个世纪以来最厉害的女巫
the most powerful witch in the last couple centuries.

533
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:02,740
如果她能找出杀掉你哥哥的办法呢？
What if she can find a way to kill him?

534
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:07,300
你什么都不知道 是吗？
You don't know, do you?

535
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,950
你杀了Klaus的话
You can't kill Klaus,

536
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:11,420
自己也会跟着死
not without dying yourself.

537
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,590
从我哥哥Kol和Finn的死亡中
We learned it from the deaths

538
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:13,720
我们知道了一些事情
of my brothers Kol and Finn.

539
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,440
如果一个始祖吸血鬼死了  
If an Original dies, every vampire

540
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,630
那他们这条血脉的吸血鬼都会跟着死去
ever made from their line dies with him.

541
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:21,550
即使你杀死了Klaus 他也终将是赢家
Even if you kill Klaus, he'll still win.

542
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:23,430
一千年来都是这样
It's been that way for 1,000 years.

543
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:25,270
那就是他的诀窍  他永远都是赢家
That's his trick. He always wins.

544
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:27,190
还有一个方法
There's another way.

545
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:29,190
什么方法？
What would that be?

546
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:31,360
我们把他永远的埋在这里
We bury him down here forever.

547
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,720
你疯了吗？
Are you mad?

548
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:34,160
这地方也许能埋得了你那帮乌合之众
This little chamber of horrors may work

549
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,580
但是你真的认为
for your riffraff, but do you really think

550
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,080
这能困得住我哥哥吗？
it will hold my brother?

551
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:40,730
难道不值得冒这个险吗？你知道我是正确的
Isn't it worth the risk? You know I'm right.

552
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:43,290
Klaus永远都不会停止对你的控制
Klaus will never stop trying to control you.

553
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:45,120
难道我真应该相信
And I'm supposed to believe

554
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,420
一个世纪以后  你会突然愿意
that after a century, suddenly you're willing

555
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:51,090
愿意冒生命危险挣脱他的束缚跟我在一起？
to risk death at his hands to be with me?

556
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,010
我想保护我的家园
I want to defend my home.

557
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:54,830
我想要自由 如果这意味着
I want to be free, and if that means

558
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:57,100
我还可以跟你在一起
I get to be with you,

559
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,180
这些都是我要埋葬他的更为正当的理由
all the more reason to bury him.

560
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:03,050
现在告诉我  你想要什么？
Now you tell me, what do you want?

561
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:09,030
你们在这啊
There you are.

562
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:11,280
原来你找到了我们的漫游侠
I see you found our wandering stray.

563
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,950
也许她能解开
Perhaps she could shed some light

564
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:15,480
当下的疑惑
on the situation.

565
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:18,320
这…
This...

566
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,270
似乎是个混血的尸体
Would appear to be the body of a hybrid.

567
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,620
他的名字叫Dwayne
His name was Dwayne.

568
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:25,440
不管他是谁  我反正没让他认祖归宗
Well, whoever he was, I didn't sire him.

569
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,460
知道这是怎么回事么？
Any idea how that's possible?

570
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:30,800
说的好像你真不知道一样
As if you didn't know.

571
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,500
啊呀呀…
Ah...

572
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:37,560
你们俩真是自来熟吗？
Aren't you two fast friends?

573
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,960
好吧  快说
Well, come on, then.

574
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,840
你们在背后合谋出了什么点子
What horrible accusation have you conspired

575
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,840
来对抗我呢？
to levy against me?

576
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:45,850
Tyler Lockwood 带Hayley来这证实一个理论 
Tyler Lockwood brought Hayley here to test a theory,

577
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:50,440
她孩子的血液可以让混血认祖归宗
that the blood of her child could be used to sire hybrids.

578
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,240
他宣称你知道这件事
He claims you knew that.

579
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,860
而且  你原打算
Furthermore, you intended

580
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,910
利用这一点来建造一支军队
to use this knowledge to build an army.

581
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:01,480
显然  你认为这件事是真的
And, of course, you assume it's true.

582
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,820
我的意思是  还有什么能让我这种人
I mean, why else would I show

583
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:07,170
对自己的亲生骨肉感兴趣呢？
any interest in my own flesh and blood?

584
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:08,990
一个心碎的 爱哭的小屁孩
A heartbroken, little crybaby

585
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:10,710
来指控我 而我的亲哥哥
points his finger at me, and my own brother

586
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:15,430
居然受骗上当 宁愿去相信他说的
falls in line, eager to believe it.

587
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:18,100
你往坏处想得可真快啊
How quickly you assume the worst,

588
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,350
尤其跟她有关的时候
especially when it comes from her.

589
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,850
哦 别义愤填膺了
Oh, spare me your indignation.

590
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:24,000
你什么时候表现出来哪怕一点
When have you ever demonstrated any kind of concern

591
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,550
对Hayley和孩子的关心呢？
towards Hayley or her child

592
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,020
除了你自私自利的追求以外
beyond your own selfish pursuits,

593
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:30,190
还有 你最开始是怎么对我说的？
and what was it you once said to me?

594
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:33,450
每位国王都需要一个继承人
"Every King needs an heir."

595
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:35,730
我的大哥
My big brother,

596
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:38,180
所以你怀疑我的意图咯
so you doubt my intentions.

597
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:41,860
我不能说我惊讶我不能说我惊讶
Well, I can't say I'm surprised.

598
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,070
在高尚的Elijah身旁
Standing beside the noble Elijah,

599
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:47,330
我只能是个微不足道的弟弟
how can I be anything but the lesser brother...

600
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:52,250
一个骗子 一个操纵者
a liar, a manipulator,

601
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:55,050
或是个私生子
a bastard?

602
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:01,920
在你眼中我就是这样的人 对吧
That's all I am to you, isn't it,

603
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:04,260
对Rebekah来说也是 而且
and to Rebekah, and judging

604
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,650
从Hayley对你言听计从来看
by the way Hayley hangs on your every word,

605
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:10,380
很明显她也是这么想的
it's clear she feels the same way.

606
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:13,570
毫无疑问 我的孩子也会一样
No doubt, my child will, as well.

607
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:15,740
弟弟 如果我...
Brother, if I...

608
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:19,660
该说的我们都说过了
we've said all that needs to be said,

609
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,940
哥哥
brother.

610
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:31,700
我现在要去扮演你们赋予我的角色了
I'll play the role I've been given.

611
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:34,870
啊！ Klaus！
Agh!Klaus!

612
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,590
哦...
Oh...

613
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:40,240
你俩好好享受彼此的陪伴吧
You two enjoy each other's company.

614
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:43,680
一旦幻觉出现 失去理智
You'll have much to bond over

615
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:48,220
你们将难分彼此
once the hallucinations and dementia set in.

616
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:50,360
就把我刚才咬的那一口
Consider that bite

617
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,530
当作送给你俩的分别之礼吧
my parting gift to you both.

618
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,620
哦...
Oh...

619
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,590
可以了
That's it.

620
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:18,930
你自由了
You're free.

621
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:22,880
啊...
Uh...

622
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:29,520
没错 我能感觉到
You're right. I can feel it.

623
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,360
之前 我一直在想
Before, I was always thinking

624
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,280
Klaus想让我做什么
about what Klaus would want me to do.

625
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:38,230
现在我只想 去他的
Now I'm like ,"screw that guy."

626
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:40,600
哈哈哈！
Ha! Ha ha ha!

627
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:44,620
Klaus Mikaelson见鬼去吧 哈！
Klaus Mikaelson can suck it. Ha!

628
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:53,660
怎么了 怎么这副表情？
What? What's that look for?

629
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:57,830
Marcel希望我能让你忘记我
Marcel wants me to make you forget about me.

630
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:01,470
哦 你不用非得那么做啊
Oh, well, you don't have to do that.

631
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:04,760
这条命是我欠你的
I owe you my life.

632
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:08,930
我会替你保密的
I'll keep your secret.

633
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:14,980
再说 能再次跟普通人交流
Besides, it's kind of nice

634
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:17,940
的感觉真棒
just talking to someone normal again.

635
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:20,410
你觉得我是个普通人？
You think I'm normal?

636
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:23,030
我是个像怪胎一样隐居在教堂阁楼的
I'm a 16-year-old witch living in a church attic

637
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:26,130
十六岁女巫
like some kind of freak.

638
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:27,980
我是个喜欢混俱乐部的男同
I'm a gay club kid who died

639
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,750
然后死掉变成了吸血鬼
and came back as a vampire.

640
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:32,500
-哈哈 -是啊
Ha ha! Yeah.

641
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:36,790
普通是相对而言的 对吧？
Normal is kind of relative, you know?

642
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:39,880
来 我们拉钩
Here. Pinky swear on it.

643
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:49,500
你不一定非得帮我
You don't have to help.

644
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,690
我可以自己从狼人古董里找到
I can dig through the werewolf antique show

645
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:54,360
想要的东西
on my own.

646
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,360
另外 你是不是应该往伤口上
Besides, shouldn't you put some kind

647
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,900
涂点药膏什么的？
of ointment or something on that?

648
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,450
一个咬伤而已 我死不了的
The bite won't kill me.

649
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,670
就像Niklaus他自己 就是一个麻烦而已
Like Niklaus himself, it's more of a nuisance
