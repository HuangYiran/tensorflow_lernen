你是找麻烦或者麻烦总来找你？

74
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,850
能不能请某人再狠狠打你的脸

我感觉像是她捡起了我刚放下的

显然我要彻底好好再想想

你知道 我真的才开始理解像是为什么人们不再用这些了
You know, I'm really starting to understand like why people don't use these anymore.

106
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,910
嗯 它只是没意义
Yeah, it just doesn't make sense.

107
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,240
去顶上
Up top.

108
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,350
闭上眼睛
Close your eyes.

109
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,090
如果你觉得我的人生很如意 你错了
If you think my life is just so easy, you're wrong.

110
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,500
那房间里似乎有个活的什么东西？
What's it like to be alive in that room right now?

111
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,850
你知道这个地方？
Do you know this place?

112
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,000
你以前看过任何人做这样的事吗？
Have you ever seen anybody do anything like this before?

113
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,870
这儿没有政治 这只是不错的老式复仇
There's no politics here, it's just good old-fashioned revenge.

114
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,200
我不想当一个好人...

116
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,750
我不相信我们的命运没有其他选择
I don't believe that we have one fate and no choice.

117
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,510
我们塑造我们拥有的生活
We make our own lives.

118
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,700
那就是为什么你在这儿
That is why you are here.

119
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,870
我活下来了！
I survive!

120
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,650
我绝不会陷入绝望！

...我奉命来终结你！

127
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:52,850
我不能等待生活把你撕成碎片

128
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,460
它已找到你

129
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:55,800
这是唯一的出路
This is the only way.

130
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,210
你真相信神会下来拯救你吗？
You really believe that God will come down and save you?

131
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,880
跟他说下来阻止我
Tell him to come down and stop me.

132

你没法重复过去
You can't repeat the past.

133
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,300
不能重复过去？
Can't repeat the past?

134
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,700
不能
No.

135
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:30,620
为什么 你当然可以的
