26
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,150
我沒事兒
I'm okay.

27
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:56,600
只是被子彈擦傷了
Bullet just grazed me.

28
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,320
芬恩呢  知道她在哪兒嗎
What about Finn-- do you know where she is?

29
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,980
不知道  她不接電話
No, I don't know. She's not picking up her cell.

30
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:03,010
如果他追殺她怎么辦
What if he went after her?

31
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,760

38
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,990
我知道  找到芬恩后我馬上就去
Yeah, yeah, I'll go over there as soon as we find Finn.

不不  聽我說
No, no, listen to me, please--

40
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,000
關于過去幾天發生的事
there are gonna be a lot of questions

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,810
他們肯定有很多疑問
about what happened the last couple of days.

42
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:50,720
薩拉  我需要你現在就和布拉斯說清楚
Sara, I need you to talk to Brass now-- please.

43

50
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,300
現在應該是我了
I... I-I guess that would be me.

51
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,880
你好  我叫麥克辛·倫諾克斯
Yeah. Uh, Maxine Lennox.

52
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,260
倫諾克斯副警長  我是現場調查主管羅素
Deputy Lennox, I'm CSI Supervisor Russell.

53
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,140
我手下的一個調查員失蹤了
One of my CSIs is missing.

54
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,260
她之前曾在這里調查一宗案件
She was investigating a case up here.

55
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,280
-她叫朱莉·芬恩利  -我知道
- Her name's Julie Finlay. - Yes.

56
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,260
幾個小時前我在旅館碰見她
I saw her a few hours ago at the motel.

57
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,460
還把我的車借給了她
Lent her my car.

58
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,050
她說她要跟進一條線索
She said she was following up on a lead.

59
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,610
她說去哪兒了嗎
Did she say where she was going?

60
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,880
-沒有  -我要你現在就去警用車上
- No. - I need you to put a broadcast out

61
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,610
-發布尋人通告  -好的先生
- on your car, right now. - Yes, sir.

62
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,310
請坐下  馬上就會有人來負責
Have a seat. We'll be right with you.

63
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,430
給你帶了這個  說不定有用
I got you this; I thought you could use it.

64
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,390
謝謝
Thank you.

65
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,690
你還撐得住嗎
How you holding up?

66
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,940
這幾天不太好過
It's been a long couple of days.

67
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,020
我知道你現在不是狀態  還很擔心
Well, uh, I know things might be a little cloudy for you

68
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,080
但是我必須...
right now, but, uh...

69
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,480
對于這里發生的事情
You know, we have to officially

70
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,500
必須得有一份官方記錄
get a statement to know what happened up here.

71
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,510
這規矩我懂
I know the drill.

72
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,460
那我們就從頭開始吧
Let's start from the beginning.

73
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,900
你和另兩位現場調查員芬恩還有布洛迪
What were you and CSIs Finlay and Brody

74
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,130
在拉克斯頓做什么
doing here in Larkston?

75
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,190
我們原本沒想來拉克斯頓
Larkston was never part of the plan.

76
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:06,540
我們只是想好好享受一下  畢竟…
We just wanted to have a little fun, I mean...

77
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,500
我們多久沒有整個周末都放假了
how often do we all have the weekend off?

78
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,070
{\an8}四十八小時前

79
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:16,190
我準備回家  開瓶紅酒
Whew! I am gonna go home, open a bottle of wine

80
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,320
看赫本和特雷西的經典[美國四十年代熒屏情侶]
and watch Hepburn and Tracy movies.

81
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,920
我也想啊
Oh, wish I could do that.

82
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,570
可是我堆了好多衣服沒洗呢
I've got about a month's worth of laundry to do.

83
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,350
摩根  你有什么打算
What are you up to, Morgan?

84
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:27,200
我準備去里諾
Uh, actually, I am driving to Reno.

85
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,850
我媽給了我張水療館的禮券
My mom got me this gift certificate for a spa there.

86
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,590
那里有所有基于礦物的治療
It has all mineral-based treatments,

87
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,740
所以我要去做紫水晶按摩
so I am getting the amethyst massage.

88
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,310
它應該可以安神
It's supposed to calm the nerves

89
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,260
還能吸走點負能量
and absorb negative energy.

90
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,920
我挺需要的
I could probably use that.

91
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,120
我也是
Yeah, me, too.

92
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,120
你們應該跟我一起去
You guys should join me.

93
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,550
我有個套房
I got a suite.

94
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,820
地方夠大
Got plenty of room.

95
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:49,360
我們不想毀了你的周末
Oh, I... I mean, we don't want to crash your weekend.

96
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,710
開什么玩笑  你們能來當然好啦
Are you kidding? I would love it.

97
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,280
我討厭一個人喝酒
I hate drinking alone.

98
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,890
按摩  美酒
Massages, alcohol...?

99
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:55,690
算我一個
I'm in.

100
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:56,990
我也去
I'm in.

101
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:00,520
太棒了  好吧  我們回家換衣服
Awesome! Okay... um, let's go home, change,

102
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,590
然后一小時后在這見
and I'll meet you back here in an hour.

103
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:02,930
-好吧  -好
- Okay. - Okay.

104
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,130
但是你們沒能到里諾
But you never made it to Reno.

105
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,430
為什么呢
Why not?

106
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,250
芬恩說如果我們坐她的車
Finn said that if we took her car,

107
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,150
我們半小時內就能到
we could make it there in half the time.

108
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,940
結果證明那是個錯誤
That turned out to be a mistake.

109
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,390
這車真不錯
Yeah, she's a beauty.

110
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,460
-你裝了個440型號的  -對
- You got the 440 in there? - Yeah.

111
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,010
還有四缸汽化器
And the four barrel carb.

112
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,340
那可是很大的馬力啊
That's a lot of power.

113
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,940
我覺得我駕馭它毫無壓力
Oh, I think I can handle it.

114
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:53,450
達瑞爾  車到底壞成什么樣了
So, Darryl, uh, what's the bottom line?

115
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:56,240
-你能修好嗎  -可以  只是水箱漏了
- Can you fix it? - Uh, yeah, it's just a broken water pump.

116
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,940
我可以在一小時內換好
I can replace it in about an hour.

117
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:01,230
如果我今晚訂零件的話
Now, if, uh... I order the part tonight,

118
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,350
明天中午之前就能拿到
I should have it by noon tomorrow.

119
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:07,060
我們月光下的鹽浴要報銷了
So much for our moonlit salt scrubs.

120
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,200
我可以載你們去拉克斯頓
I can give you ladies a lift into Larkston.

121
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,830
沒有水療館  但我們有個不錯的小旅館
We don't have a spa, but we do have a nice motel.

122
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,950
而且今晚是仙人掌酒吧的K歌之夜
Plus it's karaoke night at the Cactus.

123
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,430
太棒了
Awesome.

124
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,140
走吧
Come on.

125
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:22,030
喝一杯  吃點東西  很有意思的
Have a drink, some food, it'll be fun.

126
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:25,770
笑得嘴都咧開了  你們這些家伙
Try not to look so happy, you guys.

127
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:17,590
天吶  兩杯龍舌蘭下肚
Oh, my gosh, couple shots of tequila

128
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:19,180
你就變成詹尼斯·喬普林[搖滾女歌手]了
and you turn into Janis Joplin.

129
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,660
我覺得你沒聽到歡呼聲
Yeah, I think you missed your calling.

130
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,090
-比如  太棒了  -謝謝
- Like, awesome! Wow! - Thanks. Yeah, uh, well,

131
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,670
其實我在大學里修了雙專業
I was a double major in college.

132
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,510
化學和聲樂  最終選了化學
Chemistry and voice. Chose chemistry.

133
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:29,910
但我在洛克希酒吧的一個樂隊當過一年主唱
But I was the front woman for a band at The Roxy for a year.

134
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:32,110
真不敢相信我們居然不知道這些
I can't believe we didn't know this about you.

135
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,770
說到秘密
Speaking of secrets,

136
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:36,830
我不知道你還對機械有興趣
I didn't know you were into mechanics.

137
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,780
是啊  你和達瑞爾
Yeah, you and, um, Darryl...

138
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:41,290
看起來很享受彼此今晚的陪伴
seem to be enjoying each other's company tonight.

139
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,790
他很好  他其實很聰明
He's very nice. He's, uh, he's actually smart.

140
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,360
他很有趣
He's, uh, he's funny.

141
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,490
對車了解得很多
Knows a lot about cars.

142
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,780
那他怎么還一個人喝酒  太可惜了
Oh. It's too bad he's so unattractive.

143
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,260
這些是達瑞爾請的
This round's on Darryl.

144
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,560
-謝謝你  -謝謝
- Thank you. - Oh, thank you.

145
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,790
謝謝你
Thank you.

146
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:04,390
這杯敬姑娘們的周末
All right, here's to our girls' weekend.

147
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,290
對
Yes.

148
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:14,370
-天吶  -太爽了
- Oh, God. - Aah. Whee.

149
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,900
我要回旅館去了
All right, so I'm gonna, um, go back to the motel.

150
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,290
別走啊  我點了一首碧昂絲的歌
No, I-I put in a Beyonce's song,

151
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,840
我們一起唱吧
I want us all to sing it together.

152
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,630
我跟你一起去
I'll come with you.

153
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:24,650
-喂  -不用
- Hey. - No, stay.

154
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:25,680
不用了  自己玩得開心點
Stay, have fun.

155
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,130
達瑞爾會帶我回去
Darryl's gonna walk me home.

156
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,510
我倆的話兒還沒說完呢
We need to finish the conversation.

157
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:33,090
-原來如此  -當然
-Uh huh.  - Of course you do.

158
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,880
待會兒見
See you guys later.

159
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,110
好的  祝你玩得開心
Okay. Have fun.

160
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,320
必須的
Yeah, right.

161
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,300
碧昂絲是誰
Who's Beyonce?

162
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,260
這兒夜空的星星真漂亮
Stars are really beautiful out here.

163
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:53,310
維加斯的燈光太多了
There's so many lights in Vegas, you know,

164
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,680
從來看不到星星
you never get to see them.

165
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,570
見多了我都不怎么注意到它們了
Yeah, I guess I don't really notice them anymore.

166
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,370
我生長在此
Born and raised here.

167
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:02,290
會覺得這一切都是理所當然
I guess I kind of take them for granted.

168
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,330
在這里長大是不是很棒
Was it great growing up here?

169
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:06,120
對  挺不錯的
Yeah, it was great.

170
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,660
-真的嗎  -真的很棒
- Was it? - It was real great.

171
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,050
一定不錯
Must have been.

172
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,410
你褲兜里有東西
You have something in your pocket.

173
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,630
你指的是...
You mean, um...

174
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,340
你指的是這個
you mean this.

175
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,490
被你發現了
You got me.

176
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,910
我不喜歡已婚的男人
I'm not really into married men.

177
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,770
也不喜歡騙子
Or liars.

178
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,410
我現在沒再撒謊了
I'm not lying anymore.

179
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,570
但你還是有婦之夫
You're still married.

180
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,560
可我婚姻不幸福
Not happily.

181
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:51,890
晚安
Good night.

182
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,860
晚安
Night?

183
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:03,440
知道嗎  你真是會戲弄人
You're a little tease, you know that?

184
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,690
達瑞爾  別這樣
Darryl, don't do this.

185
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:06,580
你哪兒也別想去
Not going anywhere.

186
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,210
你以為你可以勾引我一整晚
You think you can just lead me on

187
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:10,220
然后頭也不回地走開嗎
all night and then just walk away?

188
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:11,910
別這樣
Don't do this.

189
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,730
我不想傷害你
I don't want to hurt you.

190
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:17,550
可我下得了手
But I will.

191
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,790
你死定了
You're dead.

192
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,010
發生什么事了
What happened?

193
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,300
天吶
Oh, my God,

194
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,010
-你流血了  -我用刀捅了他
- you're bleeding. - I stabbed him.

195
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:57,200
-你在說什么  -他攻擊了我
- What are you talking about? - He attacked me.

196
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,340
-什么  -我覺得他死了
- What? - I think he's dead.

197
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,790
達琳  快去叫警長
Darlene, call the sheriff.

198
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,420
芬恩  發生什么事了
Finn, what happened?

199
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,300
我也不清楚
I don't know.

200
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,500
我們得帶你去醫院  你需要縫針
Okay, we gotta get you to a hospital -- you need stitches.

201
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,840
我不想去醫院
I don't want to go to the hospital.

202
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:11,450
達琳在哪兒
Where's Darryl?

203
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,930
-他就在那邊  -帶我們去看看
- He's-he's over here. - Show us.

204
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,080
他人原先就在這兒
His body was right here.

205
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,700
跑哪兒去了
Where'd it go?

206
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,300
-你捅了他幾次  -兩次
- How many times did you stab him? - I stabbed him twice.

207
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,560
刀呢  你怎么處理的
What did you do with the knife?

208
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,850
我就把刀丟在他身邊了
Uh, I-I-I dropped it beside the body.

209
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:46,440
或許你沒殺死他  芬恩
Right, maybe you didn't kill him, Finn.

210
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,490
他或許還沒死  你檢查他脈搏了嗎
Maybe he's not dead. Did you take his pulse?

211
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,470
沒有  我只是想著要逃跑
No, no, I wanted to get away.

212
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,970
可我確定當時他一動也不動了
I-I'm sure he was not moving.

213
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,010
沒事的  聽到了嗎
It's okay. All right?

214
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,440
一切都會好起來的
It's gonna be all right.

215
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,310
好
All right.

216
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:01,170
并非專用標簽  但至少可以用
They're not flags, they'll have to do.

217
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:03,160
看不出他流了多少血
Really hard to tell how much blood he lost.

218
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,660
全滲進泥土里了
It seeped into the dirt.

219
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,770
這兒有從那灘血那里延伸過來的血跡
There are blood drops moving away from the blood pool.

220
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,290
芬恩  達瑞爾穿的是牛仔靴嗎
Hey, Finn, was Darryl wearing cowboy boots?

221
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,090
是啊
Yeah.

222
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,640
這兒有鞋印
I got a boot print

223
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,700
還有對應的血跡
and corresponding blood drops.

224
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,290
他當時站著  在流血
He was on his feet and bleeding.

225
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,860
他沒死  他還能走
Ah, I didn't kill him. He walked away.

226
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,580
這兒還有第二組鞋印  看來
There's a second set of prints, so...

227
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,520
他不是獨自一人  有人幫忙
not by himself. Somebody helped him.

228
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,740
幫他上了車
Into a car.

229
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,790
血跡到輪胎印這兒
Blood drops end...

230
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,860
就沒有了
where these tire tracks begin.

231
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,370
你們這幾個姑娘在搞什么呢
What the hell you girls think you're doing?

232
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,310
別擔心
It's all right.

233
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,700
警長  我們是執法部門的
Sheriff, we're law enforcement--

234
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,190
拉斯維加斯犯罪現場調查員
Las Vegas CSIs

235
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,840
賽德爾  芬恩利和布洛迪
Sidle, Finlay and Brody.

236
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:54,700
拉斯維加斯犯罪實驗室的
Las Vegas Crime Lab?!

237
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,600
我沒請你們出現場啊
I didn't call you to work this scene.

238
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,930
我們不是來出現場的
Uh, we're not working the scene.

239
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:00,630
我們這位朋友被襲擊了
Our friend here was attacked.

240
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,920
我接到的電話說是你把他殺了
I got a phone call saying you killed him.

241
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:06,850
有證據表明達瑞爾還活著
Well, the evidence shows that Darryl is still alive.

242
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:07,580
證據
Evidence?

243
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,310
你們不是說你們不是來出現場的嗎
Thought you said you weren't working the scene.

244
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:10,680
我們真不是來出現場的
We're not working the scene.

245
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,780
我們就是四處看看
We just made a couple of observations.

246
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,750
是嘛
Yeah.

247
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,550
行  我也來看看
Yeah, I'm making a few of those myself.

248
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,560
三個姑娘  喝了酒
Three girls; been drinking...

249
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,510
一個在流血  在非工作的犯罪現場
one bleeding... messing around

250
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:27,140
亂晃搗亂
in a crime scene you got no business being in.

251
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,770
我們不是在搗亂
We're not messing around.

252
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:31,840
我怎么知道你是不是把人殺了
How do I know you didn't kill him?

253
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,320
把尸體丟棄在其他地方
Dumped his body somewhere.

254
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,450
現在又來破壞證據
Now you're tampering with the evidence.

255
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,650
-然后他把你們放了  -沒有
- So he just released you? - No.

256
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,460
沒有  他手下把我和摩根分開
No. His deputies separated Morgan and I,

257
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,810
在酒吧里問了我們話
and, uh, they interrogated us inside the bar.

258
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:50,610
芬恩呢
What about Finn?

259
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:53,000
警長把她軟禁在了汽車旅館里
Sheriff put her under house arrest in the motel.

260
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,130
芬恩說他對她進行了盤問
Finn said that he grilled her

261
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:55,990
當時醫生在給她縫傷口
while the local doctor stitched her up.

262
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,310
你是說那把匕首
So you're saying the knife...

263
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,030
是達瑞爾的
was Darryl's?

264
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:02,960
是的
Yes.

265
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,400
那怎么到了你手里
How'd it end up in your hands?

266
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,740
我跟你說了
I told you:

267
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,190
他拔出匕首
He pulled the knife,

268
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,480
想要強奸我
he tried to rape me,

269
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,120
我奪下了匕首
I grabbed the knife

270
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,310
奮力抵抗
and I fought back.

271
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,620
看看這些傷痕  警長
Look at these bruises, Sheriff.

272
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,510
是掙扎過的痕跡
Consistent with a struggle.

273
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,580
所以你出于自衛捅了他
So you stabbed him in self-defense

274
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,950
然后就在你回酒吧告訴你朋友的
and in that few minutes, while you were inside the bar

275
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,190
那幾分鐘里
telling your friends,

276
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:27,420
-有人把達瑞爾和匕首都帶走了  -是的
- someone took Darryl and the knife. - Yes.

277
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,850
他正在哪兒躲著呢  我覺得
And he is out there, and I-I think

278
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,640
你應該去找他
you should be out there looking for him.

279
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,370
我已經派手下去他家和他的汽修廠了
Oh, I got deputies going to his house and his auto shop.

280
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,870
不過  說真的
But, frankly...

281
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,620
你就行行好  省下彼此的時間
you could save us all a lot of time.

282
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,210
坦白吧
Just tell us the truth.

283
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:49,080
我說的都是實話
I am telling you the truth.

284
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,980
我是犯罪現場調查員
I am a CSI,

285
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,390
我總能享受無罪推定的權利
and I deserve the benefit of the doubt.

286
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:56,100
我認識達瑞爾·沃爾什有十五年了
I've known Darryl Walsh for 15 years.

287
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,360
我每周四都和他一起打撲克
I play poker with him every other Thursday.

288
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,860
他不像會做這種事的人
It just doesn't seem like something he'd do.

289
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,390
這些傷口又不是芬恩利女士自己弄上去的
Ms. Finlay didn't inflict these wounds herself.

290
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,820
可以了歐文  她今晚夠受的了
Come on, Owen, she's been through enough.

291
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,040
你真要把她像犯人一樣關在這兒嗎
Do you really have to keep her locked up here like a prisoner?

292
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,060
沒查清楚達瑞爾怎么樣之前
Until I figure out what happened to Darryl...

293
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,490
她哪兒都不能去
she's not going anywhere.

294
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,260
你有你的職責  馬蒂  我也是
You do your job, Marty; I'll do mine.

295
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,190
包扎好了
All done.

296
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:24,100
你會沒事的
You're gonna be just fine.

297
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,190
謝謝
Thanks.

298
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,440
芬恩有消息嗎
Any sign of Finn?

299
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,760
沒有
No.

300
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:35,750
羅素剛發了短信
Russell just texted,

301
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,300
他們還在追查線索
they're still following up on leads.

302
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,230
犯罪現場調查員布洛迪給現場拍照
So, CSI Brody took photographs of the crime scene

303
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,830
因為你相信達瑞爾·沃爾什還活著
which you believe prove that Darryl Walsh was still alive.

304
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,840
你把照片給為你做筆錄的
Now, did you share those photos with the deputies

305
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,690
-警官了嗎  -那是當然
- who questioned you? - Yes. Of course.

306
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:47,700
現場不由我們負責
I mean, it wasn't our scene.

307
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,150
法律上我們有責任轉交給他們
We were legally obligated to turn 'em over.

308
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:54,180
可摩根沒有刪除她手機里的那些照片對嗎
But Morgan didn't delete them from her cell phone, did she?

309
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,910
{\an8}胎面寬度   找到匹配

312
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,990
-你好  格雷格  -你們發給我的
- Hey, Greg. Hey. That, uh, tire track photo

313
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:23,770
現場的輪胎印  我用胎面搜索系統
that you guys sent me from the crime scene, I ran it through

314
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:26,250
查過了  輪胎是布里奇曼牌
Treadfind-- tire was manufactured

315
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:29,250
2008年制造的
by Bridgman Wheels in 2008.

316
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,470
-是什么車的輪胎  -其實是卡車
- What kind of car? - A truck, actually.

317
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:34,620
主要用于福特皮卡輕騎兵以及福特F150
Primarily the Ford Ranger and F-150.

318
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,760
我調出了車管所的記錄  這就給你發送
I pulled DMV records. Sending you a list

319
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,350
所有拉克斯頓地區
of everyone in Larkston

320
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:40,640
有這種車的車主清單
who owns that vehicle.

321
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,090
收到了  謝謝
Pulling it up now. Thank you.

322
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:47,270
-警長  -什么事
- Hey, Sheriff? - Yeah.

323
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,620
根據車管所的記錄
According to DMV records,

324
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:51,330
鎮上有三十幾輛車的輪胎印
there's over 30 vehicles in this town with tires

325
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:54,730
與我們在現場發現的吻合
that match the tracks that we found at the crime scene.

326
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,370
我只知道
Well, the last I checked,

327
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:59,330
你們并不參與此案的調查
you weren't part of this investigation.

328
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,250
警長  證據顯示
Sheriff, evidence shows

329
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,480
有人幫達瑞爾·沃爾什上了一輛卡車
that somebody helped Darryl Walsh into a truck.

330
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,410
我們找到那輛車  也許就能找到達瑞爾·沃爾什
We find the truck, maybe we find Darryl.

331
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:06,990
調查員芬恩利就清白了
It exonerates CSI Finlay.

332
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,380
你們真以為他還活著
You really think he's still alive?

333
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,670
現場沒有拖拽的痕跡
There were no drag marks.

334
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,140
鞋印和血跡說明
Boot prints and blood drops show

335
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,420
他自己站起來  走上了那輛車
that he was upright and moving when he got into the truck.

336
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,330
你搜過他家  也搜過他工作的地方
You've searched his home, you've searched his work.

337
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:16,020
都沒有他的蹤影
You haven't found him.

338
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,970
這份清單是我們最靠譜的線索了
This list is the closest thing we have to a lead.

339
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,050
我們只想請你看看
All we're asking is that you take a look at it.

340
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:21,790
看清單上有沒有誰可能
Is there anyone on here that might

341
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,590
為了達瑞爾兩肋插刀的
put themselves on the line for Darryl?

342
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,670
好吧
All right.

343
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,940
瓦萊麗·爾文  達瑞爾的妻子
Valerie Irvin, Darryl's wife.

344
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:36,300
-很好  我們去會會她  -辦不到
- Great. Let's go talk to her. - We can't.

345
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,160
今早她去了維加斯
She left for Vegas this morning.

346
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,040
我這就打給格雷格
I'll call Greg right away.

347
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,950
讓格雷格帶她到局里問話
Have him bring her in for questioning.

348
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,220
你看來并不是很擔心
You don't seem too worried

349
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,660
你丈夫  爾文女士
about your husband, Mrs. Irvin.

350
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:49,580
我是說  達瑞爾身受刀傷
I mean, Darryl was stabbed.

351
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,610
人還不見了
Now he's missing.

352
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,880
你卻在維加斯玩老虎機
And you're playing slots in Vegas.

353
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,140
他會現身的
Oh, he'll turn up.

354
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,500
他總這樣
He always does.

355
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,210
他以前也玩過失蹤
So he's gone missing before?

356
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,140
我們又不會總是黏著對方
We don't really keep tabs on each other.

357
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,160
達瑞爾有他要做的事
Darryl does his thing,

358
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,620
我也一樣
I do mine.

359
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:08,100
昨晚達瑞爾被刺傷之后  拉克斯頓有人
Uh, last night, after Darryl was stabbed, back in Larkston,

360
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,470
把他從旅館接走了
somebody picked him up from the motel.

361
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,500
反正不是我
Wasn't me.

362
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:14,650
我在餐廳工作了整晚  晚六點到早六點
I was working all night at the diner, 6:00 to 6:00.

363
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:16,500
下了班我就直接開車來這兒了
I drove straight here after my shift.

364
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:20,080
我們搜查了你的車
Uh, we searched your truck.

365
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,370
發現這東西
Found this...

366
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,650
留在地毯上
stuck to the floor mat.

367
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:27,940
那是什么
What is that?

368
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,570
是一片樹脂含量很高的葉子
It was a high resin leaf,

369
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:33,200
還有膨脹粘土塊
along with expanded clay pebbles.

370
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,330
是大麻
Marijuana.

371
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:38,170
我明白了  達瑞爾正偷偷地
I get it-- so Darryl was running a hydroponic

372
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:41,240
在無土栽培大麻
pot-growing operation under the radar.

373
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,790
說到無土栽培
Thing about hydroponics--

374
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,810
這可相當費電
it requires a lot of energy.

375
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:47,920
我找到了拉克斯頓城的電網用電量
I pulled up the electrical grid of the town of Larkston.

376
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:52,110
藍色的點代表家庭平均每月的用電量  
The blue dots represent average household electrical use per month, 

377
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,580
大約是九百千瓦
about 900 kilowatts.

378
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,890
它們都是藍點
Well, they're all blue dots.

379
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:57,670
種植大麻至少要用到那五倍的電量
A grow house would use at least five times that much power.

380
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:00,460
現在  和我一起
Now, step back in time with me

381
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,250
跟著電流回到過去
as we follow the current back to the past.

382
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:07,400
這是去年城里的月用電量回顧
This is a time lapse reversal of the town's electrical use over the past year.

383
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:09,160
那就是你要的紅點
There's your red dot--

384
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:13,140
說明四個月內的用電量超過了五千千瓦
indicates usage of over 5,000 kilowatts a month for four months.

385
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,790
之后一個月內恢復正常
Goes back to normal for a month

386
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:17,320
之后的四個月又漲回去
and then spikes again for another four months.

387
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,760
典型的大麻生長和收獲周期
Typical growth and harvest cycle for marijuana.

388
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,420
四個月生長  一個月曬干
Four months to grow, one month to dry.

389
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,440
但只能享受幾分鐘
And only minutes to enjoy it.

390
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:26,940
我聽說是這樣的
So I've heard.

391
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,340
那是什么  一棟房子嗎
So what is that, a house?

392
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:32,590
根據衛星圖像來看
Well, according to the satellite image,

393
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,700
是一個破舊的谷倉
it's a dilapidated barn,

394
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,530
登記在伊迪絲·斯金納名下
registered to Edith Skinner.

395
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:38,050
她都八十五歲了
She's 85.

396
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:39,050
{\an8}內華達  拉克斯頓  巴羅路  登記所有人  伊迪絲·斯金納  出生日期  1928年5月25

397
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:51,160
你覺得老斯金納女士會知道
Think old lady Skinner has any idea

398
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,220
達瑞爾和瓦在她的谷倉里做了什么嗎
what Darryl and Val are doing in her barn?

399
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,330
我剛跟她通過電話
I just talked to her.

400
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:56,990
達瑞爾告訴她在這停放了幾輛車
Darryl told her he was storing some cars here.

401
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,410
把那東西收起來
Put that thing away.

402
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:01,190
達瑞爾可能就藏在這里的某個角落
Darryl could be hiding in here somewhere.

403
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:02,510
我不會冒任何險的
I'm not taking any chances.

404
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:04,250
威利斯  打開后車廂
Willis, pop the trunk.

405
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,890
他不是你想像中的那種怪物
He's not the monster you're making him out to be.

406
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,140
無意冒犯  警長
No offense, Sheriff,

407
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,590
但你可能并不像你認為的那樣了解達瑞爾
but I'm not sure you know Darryl the way you think you do.

408
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,200
都不是本州車牌
Plates are all from out of state.

409
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,910
達瑞爾可能是為了它們的零件才買的
Well, Darryl could've bought 'em for spare parts.

410
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:21,080
也有可能除了培養大麻外
Or, in addition to growing pot,

411
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,380
他還開了家地下拆車廠
he's running a chop shop.

412
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:28,580
他不在這里
No sign of him.

413
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,690
警長  副警長  看看這個 
Sheriff, Deputy, take a look at this.

414
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,760
天啊
Oh, my God.

415
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,240
你還認為你的朋友不是個怪物嗎
You still think your friend's not a monster?

416
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,350
好了  我們開始吧  
All right. Let's do it.

417
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,130
好了
All right.

418
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:35,880
頭部和臉上有鈍器挫傷
Blunt force trauma to the head and face.

419
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:40,370
前臂有復合型骨折
Compound fracture to the right forearm.

420
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,030
看上去她是被毆打致死
It looks like she was beaten to death.

421
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,290
當我作驗尸官時
When I have to put on my coroner's hat,

422
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,900
死因一般都是自然死亡或者車禍
death is usually natural causes or car accidents.

423
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:51,110
很少看到這種暴力致死的
Don't see violence like this very often.

424
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:53,650
真希望我們也能這么說
Wish we could say the same.

425
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:56,270
沒有證件
No identification.

426
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:01,670
她的鞋子上有點綠色的殘留物
There's a green residue on the shoes here-- hmm.

427
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:07,440
不是從車里來的
Didn't come from the car.

428
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,050
我能采一下樣嗎
Do you mind if I collect it?

429
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:10,150
沒問題
Not at all.

430
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:11,420
沒有新鮮的血液
There's no fresh blood.

431
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,710
沒有跡象表明達瑞爾昨晚來過這兒
There's no evidence that Darryl was here last night.

432
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:15,380
已核實過他妻子的供詞
Wife's alibi checked out.

433
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,860
帶他走的人并不是瓦
Val wasn't the one that picked him up.

434
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,400
可能是他的朋友載了他一程
Maybe one of his buddies gave him a ride,

435
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,700
并把他藏在某處
and he's hiding him somewhere.

436
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,760
瓦說她根本不知道達瑞爾在這兒做的事
Val said that she had no idea what Darryl was doing up here.

437
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,770
她說他成天借她的車
Said that he borrows her truck all the time.

438
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:27,400
這樣她車里的石塊和大麻葉就解釋的通了
It could explain the pebbles and the cannabis.

439
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,730
我去查一下這些車的牌照和登記資料
I'll run the license and registration on these vehicles.

440
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:31,320
看能否查到車主信息
See if we can figure out who they belong to.

441
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,480
謝謝你  警長
Thanks. Uh, Sheriff...

442
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:36,990
我非常希望你能讓現場調查員芬恩利過來幫忙
I would really like CSI Finlay to help us out on the case.

443
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:39,520
現在沒有理由再把她關在酒店房間里
There's no reason to keep her locked up in that motel room.

444
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,800
但她的確捅了達瑞爾
She still stabbed Darryl.

445
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,190
那是出于正當防衛
In self-defense.

446
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:44,110
但她和這個犯罪現場毫無瓜葛
But she had nothing to do with this crime scene,

447
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,670
而且坦白說
and frankly...

448
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,830
我們確實需要她的幫助
we could really use her help.

449
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,390
好吧
Fine.

450
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:53,270
我會撤銷軟禁令  但是她不能離開鎮子
I'll lift the house arrest, but she's not leaving town.

451
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,340
還有一件事
One more thing...

452
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,100
有沒有人說過你有點得寸進尺
Anyone ever tell you you're pushy?

453
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,010
我需要在場所有人的DNA樣品
I just need DNA samples from everyone here,

454
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,450
以便從檢驗結果中排除
for elimination purposes.

455
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:04,700
什么  你覺得我們之間有人與此案有關嗎
What, you think one of us had something to do with this?

456
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:06,150
只是走個程序
Just procedure.

457
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,360
然后呢
Then what happened?

458
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,860
摩根帶著那些樣品回到實驗室
Morgan took those samples back to the lab.

459
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,490
那尸檢呢  是由金尼醫生負責嗎
What about the body-- did Dr. Kinney do the autopsy?

460
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:16,550
不是的
No. No.

461
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:19,480
鑒于他在法醫病理學上經驗有限
Because of his limited experience in forensic pathology,

462
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,390
摩根就把尸體也帶回了拉斯維加斯
Morgan took the body back to Vegas as well.

463
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:23,830
交給大衛·菲利普斯處理
She handed it off to David Phillips.

464
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:31,160
讓我理一理
So, let me get this straight.

465
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:35,240
芬恩  摩根和薩拉本來打算周末出去玩
Finn, Morgan and Sara go away for a nice fun weekend,

466
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,020
結果芬恩遭遇襲擊
Finn is then attacked,

467
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:41,040
被控謀殺  薩拉還找到另一具尸體
accused of murder and Sara finds a body?

468
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:41,950
沒錯
Yeah.

469
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:44,710
和她們預想的輕松假期大相徑庭
Not the relaxing weekend they were hoping for.

470
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:48,070
大衛  地中海酒店發現一具尸體
Hey, David, there's a 419 at the Mediterranean.

471
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,150
我去看看
I'm on it.

472
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,900
死者指甲上畫著南瓜
Pumpkins painted on her nails.

473
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,150
看來她很熱衷于萬圣節
Must've liked Halloween.

474
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:58,920
她可能就是那時失蹤的
That could be when she went missing.

475
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,940
我去給她的手指補補水
I'll rehydrate her fingertip,

476
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,610
看能不能查到身份信息
see if we can get an I.D.

477
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:06,160
基于環境溫度和尸體的情況
Based on the temperature of the building and the condition of the body,

478
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:08,990
死亡時間不超過一個月
I'd say she's been dead less than a month.

479
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,660
這像是勒痕
These look like ligature marks.

480
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,790
傷痕很細
Narrow.

481
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,300
兇手應該是用繩子將她捆住
Killer could've used a string to tie her up.

482
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,140
可能是電線
Maybe wire.

483
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,240
死者生前遭到捆綁和毆打
Restrained and beaten.

484
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,610
圓形傷口的形狀和尺寸說明
Circular size and shape tell me

485
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:23,860
她是被錘子打死的
she was hit repeatedly with a hammer.

486
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,370
能看出來她的年齡嗎
Any idea how old she was?

487
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:28,780
智齒已經張全  超過十八歲
Wisdom teeth are present, so she's over 18.

488
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,490
她牙齒上沾著點東西
And there's something in her teeth.

489
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,690
幫我拿一下手電
Could you hold that?

490
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,630
看起來像是陰毛
Looks like a pubic hair.

491
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:48,330
說明臨死前還有性行為
Suggests sexual activity close to the time of death.

492
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,440
考慮到她曾被捆住手腳
Considering that she was restrained,

493
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,410
我敢說這事肯定不是你情我愿
I'm betting the sex wasn't consensual.

494
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,780
我去做一套性侵犯檢查
I'll collect an SAE kit.

495
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,220
毛囊還未脫落
Follicle is still attached.

496
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,040
應該能提取出DNA
Should be able to get DNA.

497
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:00,430
也許能幫我們查到兇手
Might help us identify her killer.

498
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:05,800
你查到什么了
What did you find out?

499
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,790
死者名叫布倫達·惠特克
Victim's name is Brenda Whittaker.

500
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:11,050
二十三歲  來自圣地亞哥
She is a 23-year-old from San Diego.

501
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:12,780
四個月前失蹤
Disappeared four months ago.

502
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,870
交叉比對過她的駕照和車輛注冊信息
Cross-referenced her driver's license and registration

503
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:17,550
以及指紋  證明死者就是她
and prints confirmed it was her.

504
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,590
{\an8}羅素

505
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,540
生前被囚禁并強奸
Held against her will and raped.

506
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:23,300
我們從她口部  肛門以及陰道中
Spermatozoa was found in the oral, anal and vaginal samples

507
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,610
{\an8}布倫達·惠特克

508
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,660
均發現精子痕跡
collected from the victim.

509
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,380
DNA檢測結果還未出來
Still waiting on the DNA.

510
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,450
這結果足以證明達瑞爾是個殺人兇手
Which will prove Darryl's a murderer.

511
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:29,890
不敢相信他還逍遙法外
Can't believe he's still out there.

512
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:32,090
所以你最好小心點
Which is why you better watch your back.

513
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:35,000
說說谷倉里其他幾輛車的情況
Tell me about the other cars in the barn.

514
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
是另外兩名失蹤女性的車
They belong to two other missing women.

515
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:40,320
來自塞多納的十九歲大學生
A 19-year-old college student from Sedona

516
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,400
{\an8}艾普利·丹尼斯  佩內洛普·萬斯

517
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,030
還有來自鹽湖城的二十八歲女招待
and a 28-year-old waitress from Salt Lake City--

518
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:47,350
她們都獨自旅行  失蹤一年以上
both missing for over a year and both traveling alone.

519
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:49,110
達瑞爾是個修理工  對吧
Darryl's a mechanic, right?

520
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:52,790
沒錯  他開了家加油站還有一間修理廠
Yeah, he operates a gas station and a garage.

521
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:57,620
那么也許這幾個女人車壞了  或者去加油
So maybe these women had car trouble, stopped for gas.

522
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,870
正好又是達瑞爾的菜
Just happened to be Darryl's type.

523
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:02,090
他就引誘她們  綁架她們
He seduced them, abducted them,

524
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:04,610
強奸她們  也許還殺了她們
raped them, and probably killed them.

525
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:08,010
目前只找到了布倫達·惠特克的尸體
Brenda Whittaker was the only one found.

526
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:10,720
其他幾具尸體肯定被達瑞爾拋尸他處了
Darryl must've dumped the other bodies someplace else.

527
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,540
霍奇斯打電話來了  我得掛了
Oh, hey. This is Hodges. I have to go.

528
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,140
{\an8}大衛·霍奇斯
工作

529
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,060
掛吧
Oh, go ahead.

530
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,000
有什么發現嗎
What have you got?

531
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,600
檢測了摩根從受害者鞋上收集的東西
Trace Morgan collected from the victim's shoes--

532
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,020
短棘盤星藻
pediastrum boryanum.

533
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:21,910
藻類
Algae?

534
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:25,370
只在淡水中生長的綠色藻類
Specifically green algae found in fresh water.

535
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,490
我查了下
I did some checking,

536
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:30,570
最近的淡水水體也在二百四十公里外了
and the nearest large body of fresh water is over 150 miles away.

537
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:32,460
這不可能啊
That doesn't make any sense.

538
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,300
昨晚我們通電話的時候  芬恩就在這兒
Finn was here when we spoke on the phone last night,

539
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:38,900
所以她最后就是出現在這
so this is the last place she was seen.

540
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,210
而且就是
And that was...

541
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,370
幾小時前
a few hours ago.

542
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:45,550
我們知道她借了副警長的車
Well, we know she borrowed the Deputy's car.

543
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:47,730
她要去哪
Where was she going?

544
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:49,540
她哪都不該去的
She shouldn't have been going anywhere.

545
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,780
{\an8}管理員

546
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,610
她筆記本有密碼
Her laptop's locked.

547
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,740
知道密碼可能是什么嗎
Any idea what the password might be?

548
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,260
血性女孩
Um... bloodgirl.

549
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,190
不對
Nope.

550
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,540
血性女孩528
Bloodgirl528?

551
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:03,030
{\an8}密碼錯誤

552
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:03,990
不對
No, sir. No.

553
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,620
對了  我想到了
Oh, I know, I know-- uh...

554
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,530
試試"愛格妮思"
Try "Agnes."

555
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,770
愛格妮思  是誰
Agnes? Who's that?

556
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:12,270
她深愛的瘋阿姨
Crazy aunt she loved.

557
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:16,070
進去了
Worked. All right.

558
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:18,650
根據她的瀏覽記錄
So, according to her Web history,

559
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:23,220
她在找這附近的淡水水體
she was looking for fresh bodies of water in the area.

560
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,180
她找到了嗎
Did she find any?

561
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,970
沒有  這上面看是沒有
No, not according to this.

562
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:28,340
她在仙人掌燒烤酒吧的廣告單上
She wrote the name "Gary" next to an ad

563
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,820
寫了一個叫加里的名字
for the Diamond Cactus Bar & Grill.

564
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,780
那就是她們周五晚上去的那家酒吧
That's the bar they were at Friday night.

565
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,850
給他們打個電話
Give them a little call here.

566
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:36,790
你好
Uh, hey, there.

567
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:39,080
加里在嗎
Um... is Gary around?

568
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,450
下班了是嗎
He's on his break?

569
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:44,110
好的  謝謝
Okay. Thank you.

570
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:46,080
他是那個酒保
He's the bartender.

571
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,750
要是想了解鎮上的信息
If I was looking for information around town,

572
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,440
我肯定第一個去問他
that'd be the first place I'd start.

573
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,130
我們去跟他談談
Yeah, let's go talk to him.

574
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,920
犯罪現場調查員芬恩利
Did CSI Finlay ask you

575
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,440
問了你關于淡水水體的事嗎
anything about bodies of water?

576
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,450
問了
Yeah.

577
00:27:58,450 --> 00:27:59,070
她想知道
She wanted to know

578
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:02,310
這附近有沒有在地圖上沒被標記過的湖或者溪流
if there were any lakes or streams nearby that weren't on a map.

579
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:05,460
我能想到的只有巖石湖
Only thing I could think of was Stone Rock Lake.

580
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,010
是個人造湖嗎
Is that a man-made lake?

581
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:08,190
現在只是個大坑了
Just a hole in the ground now.

582
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,300
好幾年前就干了
It dried up years ago.

583
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,760
藻類還是能存活下來的
You know, the algae would still be there.

584
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,090
離這兒有多遠
How far away is this place?

585
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,270
離這兒四十八公里
About 30 miles from here

586
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:15,020
就在舊的巖石湖露營地
in the old Stone Rock Lake campground.

587
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,490
就在史蒂文森高速邊
Just off Stevenson Highway.

588
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:17,790
謝謝你  加里
Thanks, Gary.

589
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,410
你怎么看
What do you think?

590
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:23,870
我最討厭查錯方向了
I'd hate to go running off in the wrong direction.

591
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:26,120
我覺得那個廢棄的露營地
Well, I think that an abandoned campground

592
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:29,030
是達瑞爾關押女性人質的絕佳場所
would be a great place for Darryl to hold women hostage.

593
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:31,350
也是個完美的藏身地
Be a good place for him to hide out, too.

594
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:33,610
芬恩在兩個小時前就出發了
Finn's got a two-hour head start on us.

595
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:36,160
我們得趕在她找到達瑞爾之前找到她
Let's go find her before she finds him.

596
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:39,110
那怎么會最后變成槍戰了呢
So how'd you end up in a nasty gunfight?

597
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:42,890
威利斯副警長說他得到消息
Deputy Willis said that he got a tip

598
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:45,260
有人看到達瑞爾的車停在路邊
that Darryl's car had been spotted on the side of the road,

599
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,530
就在州際公路邊上
just off the interstate.

600
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:50,110
所以我和警長一起去看看
So... I went with the sheriff to check it out.

601
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:04,060
達瑞爾
Darryl!

602
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,370
我是歐文
It's Owen!

603
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,150
馬上下車
Get out of the vehicle!

604
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:09,100
我們持有武器  達瑞爾
We're armed, Darryl!

605
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:11,650
快  把手伸出來
Come on, show us your hands!

606
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,890
他不在車里
He's not here.

607
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:32,740
那個巴士站還在用嗎
Is that bus stop still active?

608
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,630
對  在用
Yes, it is.

609
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:35,790
巴士是去哪兒的
Where does it go?

610
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:38,940
里諾市  但他可能已經在那乘上了飛機
Reno. But from there, he could've hopped a plane.

611
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,320
現在他可能在任何地方
He could be anywhere by now.

612
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,830
去用對講機問下
Get on the radio and find out

613
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,090
最近經過這里的巴士是什么時候
when the last bus came through here.

614
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:45,170
亨利  怎么了
Hey, Henry, what's up?

615
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,440
你確定嗎
Are you sure?

616
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,240
好  謝謝
Okay. Thanks.

617
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:54,700
我需要從拉克斯頓到里諾的巴士時刻表  謝謝
I need a bus schedule from Larkston to Reno, please.

618
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:01,550
你這是要干什么
What the hell are you doing?

619
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,050
放下武器
Drop your weapons.

620
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:15,650
警長  從威利斯副警長身邊走開
Sheriff, step away from Deputy Willis.

621
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:16,450
警長
Sheriff...

622
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:19,280
除非你告訴我這是怎么回事  否則我不走
I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what the hell's going on.

623
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,030
谷倉女尸身上提取的精液
Got DNA results on semen

624
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,710
DNA檢測結果已經出來了
recovered from the woman's body in the barn.

625
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:24,020
分別屬于兩名男性
There were two male contributors.

626
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,240
你是說有兩名男性與那名女性的死有關嗎
You telling me there was two men involved in that woman's death?

627
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,700
達瑞爾·沃爾什和西蒙·威利斯副警長
Darryl Walsh and Deputy Simon Willis.

628
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:31,190
什么  簡直胡說八道
What? That's crazy.

629
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:32,950
賽德爾女士  這里一定有什么誤會
Ms. Sidle, there's got to be some kind of mistake.

630
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:35,210
我同事對比過我在罪案現場
My colleague compared the samples of the DNA

631
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:38,340
從你和副警長身上取來的DNA樣本
that I got off of you and your deputies at the crime scene.

632
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:40,090
不可能有錯
No mistake.

633
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:41,780
西蒙
Simon,

634
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:44,220
你和那女人的死有沒有關系
did you have anything to do with that woman's death?

635
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,480
沒有  歐文  拜托  你清楚我的為人
No. Owen, come on, you know me.

636
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:55,010
你何不...
Why don't you...

637
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:58,130
何不先把槍放下
why don't you put the gun down,

638
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,690
我們再好好談談
we'll talk about it.

639
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,030
好吧
Okay.

640
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,080
幸好你只是擦傷了
You're lucky it was just a graze.

641
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,310
是啊
Yeah.

642
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,320
我設法聯系到了摩根
I managed to get a call through to Morgan and...

643
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,970
不久支援就到了
shortly after that, help arrived.

644
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:28,340
你救了加德納警長的命
You know, you saved Sheriff Gardner's life.

645
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:30,930
我收到了他做完手術的消息
I got a message that he's out of surgery.

646
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:33,680
他對事發時的描述與你一致
His version of the facts matches yours.

647
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:34,690
所以  我們這完事了嗎
So, we're done?

648
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:37,010
我會向內務部提交一份報告
I'll just file a report with the IAB,

649
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:38,540
他們自有定奪
they'll make their determination,

650
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:39,990
但不會有事的
but I wouldn't sweat it.

651
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:42,710
謝謝你特地跑過來
Thank you for coming.

652
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,200
不客氣  我應該的
You're welcome. Of course.

653
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:49,600
薩拉
Oh, hey, Sara?

654
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,570
怎么了
Yeah?

655
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:52,410
如果你有芬恩的消息  要告訴我
Let me know when you hear about Finn.

656
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,450
我會的
I will.

657
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:58,870
{\an8}巖石湖歡迎您

658
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:24,190
車牌號對上了
Plate's a match.

659
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,410
和倫諾克斯副警長的車相符
Match Deputy Lennox's car,

660
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:28,630
芬恩一定在這附近
so Finn's got to be around here.

661
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:30,110
鑰匙在車里
The keys are in it.

662
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,670
一定是車出故障了
She must've had car trouble.

663
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:42,440
發動機盤管線被切斷了
Coil wires have been cut.

664
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,510
達瑞爾想把她困在這里
Darryl wanted to make sure she couldn't leave.

665
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,400
尼克  我在車里發現了血跡
Nick... I got blood in the car.

666
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,270
好的
Okay.

667
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:52,430
我們行動吧
Let's go.

668
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:05,630
去右邊
Take the right.

669
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,440
芬恩
Finn?

670
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,390
我在這邊發現了一具男尸
I got a body over here, man.

671
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:25,960
他是達瑞爾·沃爾什
It's Darryl Walsh.

672
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,840
子彈正中胸口
Shot in the chest.

673
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:31,880
他已經死透了
He's dead as a doornail.

674
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,630
好吧  那么
All right, so...

675
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:36,680
芬恩沒死  那她到底在哪里
Finn's not dead, then where the hell is she?

676
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:38,970
顯然  這里就是
Obviously, this is where...

677
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,520
他囚禁女孩們的地方
he kept the girls.

678
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:43,620
沒錯
Yeah.

679
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,300
看看這里有些什么
So what do we got here?

680
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:57,390
發現了一套配備齊全的強奸工具箱
Got a fully loaded rape kit.

681
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,530
三顆子彈殼
Three shells.

682
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:07,560
0.380英寸子彈殼  與芬恩的槍相符
380 casing-- same as Finn.

683
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,020
這是她的手機
It's her cell phone.

684
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:20,930
好吧  咱們來推理一下
All right, let-let's figure this out.

685
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,650
首先
Well, for starters,

686
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:28,980
斧柄全是血跡
we got an ax handle with blood all over it.

687
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:30,750
強奸工具箱是打開的
Rape kit's open.

688
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,190
她的手機挨著它
Her cell phone's right next to it,

689
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:35,380
也許當時她正想要拍下犯罪現場  對嗎
so maybe she was trying to document the crime scene, right?

690
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,330
沒錯  他弄廢了她的車
Yeah, he disables her car,

691
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:40,690
他在返回途中拿了這把斧子  然后
he grabs the handle on his way back inside, and just...

692
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,640
偷襲了她
ambushes her.

693
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,770
這肯定惹毛了她
And that would have pissed her off.

694
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:53,250
是的  沒錯  她肯定反擊了
Yeah, yeah. She fought back, for sure.

695
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,650
這邊墻上有兩顆子彈
And there's two bullets in the wall right here.

696
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:12,050
所以她開了三槍...
So she gets off three shots--

697
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:15,280
前兩槍打偏了  但是第三槍  天吶
two miss, but that third one, boy...

698
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:19,170
正中他的胸口
punched a hole in his chest.

699
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:23,680
血泊邊緣呈液態  所以...
Blood pool is still liquid around the edges, so...

700
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,760
這肯定是不久前剛發生的
this couldn't have happened too long ago.

701
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,390
車已報廢  她應該是步行離開
Car's dead, she's got to be on foot.

702
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:29,890
經過這次打斗后
After she makes it through this mess,

703
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:31,770
她可能徑直走向大路了
she probably made a beeline for the road.

704
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:34,270
我需要你留在這兒處理犯罪現場
I need you to stay here and process this scene.

705
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:35,830
芬恩槍殺了這家伙
Finn shot the guy.

706
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:37,360
我們得處理好
We need to do this right.

707
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,970
我去找她
I'll go look for her.

708
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,030
好的
Okay.

709
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:23,320
芬恩
Finn?

710
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:39,190
我們找朱莉·芬恩利
We're looking for Julie Finlay.

711
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:40,840
她的房間就在拐角處
She's right around the corner.

712
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,550
羅素  她怎么樣了
Russell... how is she?

713
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,360
血已經止住了
They were able to stop the bleeding.

714
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,710
她的脾破裂
She has a ruptured spleen,

715
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:50,860
兩根肋骨被撞斷  還有腦震蕩
two broken ribs, and a concussion.

716
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,100
但她會好起來的
She's gonna be okay, though.

717
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,170
謝天謝地
Thank God.

718
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,160
醫生們說
The doctors say that

719
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:58,060
她所受的創傷與車撞傷相吻合
her injuries are consistent with being hit by a car.

720
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,740
我去過那條路
I was out on that road.

721
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,720
并沒有發現任何剎車痕跡
I didn't see any skid marks.

722
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:03,690
這是蓄意撞人
This was intentional.

723
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:06,130
達瑞爾·沃爾什和副警長威利斯都已經死了
Darryl Walsh and Deputy Willis are both dead.

724
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:07,510
還會是誰做的呢
Who else could be behind this?

725
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:09,110
我們會查清楚的
That's what we're gonna find out.

726
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,050
不如你們去檢查她全身及其衣物
Why don't you go ahead and process her and her clothes.

727
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,480
看看能發現什么
See what we can find.

728
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,360
這些條狀淤青是被汽車護柵撞的
So, these bruise lines were made by the grill of the car.

729
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,250
那這個圓圈是某種車輛標志嗎
So, this circle, is that some sort of logo?

730
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:09,880
不知道  我試試看能否提高分辨率
I don't know. Let me see if I can enhance it.

731
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,800
"MMC"
"MMC"?

732
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,170
那是什么車
What kind of car is that?

733
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:25,400
那不是車的標志
That's not a car.

734
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:27,420
是種榮譽徽章
That's a badge of honor.

735
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:30,120
我曾在古董車展上碰到過一個家伙
I-I saw this guy on one of those antique car shows.

736
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,860
他只開一輛古董車  開了好多年
He had this old car, he drove it for years,

737
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,730
當里程數積滿161萬公里時
and when he hit a million miles,

738
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:37,110
他就能在車的格柵前裝上一個徽章
he got an emblem to put on the grill of his car.

739
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:38,380
{\an8}正在搜索

740
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:42,030
百萬英里俱樂部
"Million Mile Club."

741
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,130
MMC
MMC.

742
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:45,140
這個俱樂部很高端
It's very exclusive.

743
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,420
{\an8}內華達州  拉克斯頓

744
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:50,990
拉克斯頓鎮上剛好有一位會員
And the town of Larkston has one member.

745
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:04,410
醫生
Hey, Doc.

746
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,650
我能坐這嗎
Mind if I join you?

747
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,760
有什么事嗎
Wh-What's this about?

748
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:16,580
我看到你的車停在外面
Well, I saw your car parked out front.

749
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:19,670
看起來  它出過事故啊
Looks like it's... been in an accident.

750
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:21,510
真是太可惜了
Now, that'd be a real shame--

751
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:24,250
畢竟那輛車你開了那么長時間
you've been driving that car for a long time.

752
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:26,150
行駛距離超過了一百萬英里[約160萬公里]
You got over a million miles on it.

753
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:29,590
你還因此得到了一個很棒的格柵徽章
You even have that cool grill badge to prove it.

754
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:30,900
那東西真不錯
Love that thing.

755
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,050
當你開車撞我朋友時
It also made quite an impression on my friend...

756
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:37,390
還在她身上留下了一個印記
when you hit her with your car.

757
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,500
這是場意外
It was an accident.

758
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,630
不  不是
No, it wasn't.

759
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:48,020
你蓄意謀殺調查員芬恩利
You tried to kill CSI Finlay

760
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:49,860
是為了掩蓋自己齷蹉的秘密
to protect your nasty secret.

761
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,480
什么齷蹉的秘密
What nasty secret?

762
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,940
你是副警長威利斯和達瑞爾·沃爾什
That you're a part of Deputy Willis and Darryl Walsh's

763
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,150
綁架團伙中的一員
little rape club.

764
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:57,020
不是這樣的
That's not true.

765
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:00,280
我找到了你去過巖石湖旁小屋的證據
I found evidence you were in the cabin in Stone Rock Lake.

766
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,040
我去那只是為了在調查員芬恩利刺傷達瑞爾后
I was only there to stitch up Darryl

767
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,000
去幫他縫合傷口
after CSI Finlay stabbed him.

768
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,860
副警長威利斯強迫我的
Deputy Willis forced me.

769
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:10,220
那強奸布倫達·惠特克也是他強迫的嗎
Did he also force you to rape Brenda Whittaker?

770
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,220
得了吧  我是位犯罪現場調查員
Come on. I'm a CSI, man,

771
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,270
還是很優秀的一位
and a pretty good one.

772
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:18,670
你沒想到我會在門前的垃圾桶里
You don't think I'm gonna find your dirty, nasty used condoms

773
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,390
找到那惡心的使用過的安全套嗎
in the trash can out front?

774
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,180
上面全是DNA
DNA was all over them.

775
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:29,990
我是跟她發生過性關系
So, I had sex with her.

776
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:33,990
不  你強奸了她
No. You raped her.

777
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:37,140
還強行捆綁她長達數月
And tying a woman up against her will, for months,

778
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:41,820
然后一遍又一遍地強奸她
and raping her over and over and over again,

779
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:44,240
之后你用鐵錘砸爛了她的頭
and then, you bash her head in with a hammer,

780
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:47,280
把尸體藏在她車子的引擎蓋下
and you dump her body in the hood of her car--

781
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:50,290
我想不說你都知道這是什么罪了吧
I don't think I need to tell you what that is.

782
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:52,830
她的死與我無關
I had nothing to do with her death.

783
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:55,610
都是達瑞爾和副警長威利斯干的
That was all Darryl and-and Deputy Willis.

784
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:57,250
他們已經死了
Well, they're gone.

785
00:40:57,250 --> 00:41:00,020
只剩你來承擔責任了
You're the one left holding the bag now.

786
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:05,670
我知道至少還有兩個女人失蹤
So, I know there are at least two other women missing.

787
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:07,300
她們的尸體在哪里
Where are their bodies?

788
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,870
我不知道  我...
I don't know. I...

789
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,960
達瑞爾說他會處理尸體的
Darryl said they took care of them.

790
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:18,390
我只是跟他們做愛罷了
All I did was have sex with those girls.

791
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:20,990
沒做過傷害她們的事
I-I never did anything to hurt them.

792
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,330
你以為強奸算什么
What do you think rape is?

793
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:30,380
你心理真扭曲  金尼醫生
You're a sick man, Dr. Kinney.

794
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:32,040
你需要幫助
You need some help.

795
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,980
現在你被捕了
And now you're under arrest.

796
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,470
你聽到了
You heard the man.

797
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:44,060
起來吧  走吧
Come on, let's go.

798
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:54,800
你怎么樣了
How you doing?

799
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:56,780
你還好嗎  還需要藥嗎
You all right? Want some more drugs?

800
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,990
現在打的這種藥就挺好的
I do like the ones I'm on.

801
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:05,060
我們差點以為要失去你了  朱爾斯
Thought we almost lost you there for a minute, Jules.

802
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:08,910
我都已經開始面試替代你的人了
I already started interviewing replacements.

803
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,500
真的嗎  你以為這么輕易就能擺脫我嗎
Yeah? You think you can get rid of me that easily?

804
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,020
想想總可以吧
We could always hope.

805
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:14,910
準備見更多的訪客了嗎
Up for more visitors?

806
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:18,620
我明天再打給你
I'll call you tomorrow.

807
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,670
好的
Okay.

808
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:22,440
我們沒能去成水療館
So, we never made it to the spa.

809
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,850
至少能給你帶點替代品
Thought we'd bring it to you.

810
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:25,320
謝謝
Thank you.

811
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:28,640
那你下個周末打算做什么
So what do you want to do next weekend?
