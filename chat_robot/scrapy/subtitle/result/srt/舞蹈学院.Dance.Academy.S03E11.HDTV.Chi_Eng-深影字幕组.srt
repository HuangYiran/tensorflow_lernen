舞蹈学院 前情提要
Previously on Dance Academy...

2
00:00:02,473 --> 00:00:04,871
杰弗里先生把自己欣赏的演员列了个表
Sir Jeffery has a list of who fits his vision.

3
00:00:04,871 --> 00:00:06,863
从你们进校第一天起他就开始列了
He starts it when you enter first year

4
00:00:06,863 --> 00:00:09,224
随后他会根据受伤情况或体型变化而不断修正
Then he revises it for injury or change of body shape.

5
00:00:10,053 --> 00:00:12,017
够了
That's enough.

6
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:16,062
她没事的 我老师以前一直这么训练我
She's fine. My teachers did that to me all the time.

7
00:00:16,146 --> 00:00:21,230
我成功请回了舞团曾经的头牌舞者之一
I have managed to lure back one of the company's leading lights.

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,052
我受够了 我一直在想 这一切何时才能结束
I'm sick of it! I keep thinking, when is this going to stop?

9
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:29,068
因为我好想摆脱你
Because I want so much to be rid of you.

10
00:01:10,568 --> 00:01:14,479
舞蹈学院 第三季第11集

11
00:01:14,524 --> 00:01:17,520
我们已经到了一年之末
We're definitely reaching the pointy end of the year.

12
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:19,548
每个人都感觉到了
Everyone is feeling that.

13
00:01:19,548 --> 00:01:23,532
改变 无处不在
Change. It's, like, lurking everywhere.

14
00:01:23,532 --> 00:01:26,540
我是说 我觉得我们应该在一起
I said, I think we should be together.

15
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,504
是的 我听出你的意思了
Yeah, I got that part.

16
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,496
为什么呢
Why?

17
00:01:31,512 --> 00:01:32,544
你对我说过
You told me once.

18
00:01:32,544 --> 00:01:36,524
我得有一个长远的追求 我现在找到了
I have to figure out what I wanted long-term, and I did.

19
00:01:36,544 --> 00:01:37,977
有两件事 
Two things. 

20
00:01:37,977 --> 00:01:42,710
其一是我会竭尽所能进入舞团 
I'm going to do everything I can to get into the company, 

21
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,656
其二就是和你在一起
and I want to be with you.

22
00:01:44,656 --> 00:01:48,078
克里斯提 塔拉 你们得过来看看这个
Christian, Tara, you guys need to see this.

23
00:01:49,504 --> 00:01:51,484
考虑一下吧
Think it over.

24
00:01:51,504 --> 00:01:54,548
担任了国家芭蕾舞团艺术指导十六年
After 16 years as artistic director

25
00:01:54,548 --> 00:02:00,528
并在剧院奉献了毕生精力之后
of the National Ballet and a lifetime in the theatre,

26
00:02:00,548 --> 00:02:05,508
我想是时候完美谢幕了
I feel the day has come to exit the stage gracefully.

27
00:02:05,528 --> 00:02:07,504
- 哇哦 - 游戏规则看来要改变了
- Whoa. - Game changer.

28
00:02:07,524 --> 00:02:10,536
我将把我在舞团的话语权
I do leave assured my legacy will be in safe hands

29
00:02:10,536 --> 00:02:13,532
转交给新一任的艺术指导
under the new artistic director,

30
00:02:13,532 --> 00:02:17,504
我的得意门生 瑞贝卡・布莱斯怀特
my gifted protegee, Rebecca Braithwaite.

31
00:02:17,524 --> 00:02:19,548
在上任初期 这位新艺术指导
At this early stage the new artistic director

32
00:02:19,548 --> 00:02:23,480
拒绝透露她对于舞团的个人展望
refused to be drawn on her personal vision for the company.

33
00:02:23,496 --> 00:02:25,488
这事儿有意思了
Things just got interesting.

34
00:02:25,508 --> 00:02:26,967
评论家称其过于年轻
Critics may claim she's too young,

35
00:02:26,967 --> 00:02:29,370
对此职务也显得经验不足
too inexperienced for this appointment.

36
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:33,797
然而这却会对舞团传统带来一次变革
However, It does suggest there is a push away from tradition.

37
00:02:33,797 --> 00:02:35,534
可以确定的是
One thing is certain

38
00:02:35,534 --> 00:02:39,584
芭蕾舞界将会迎来一个活跃的崭新时代
the ballet community faces a tumultuous new era.

39
00:02:39,584 --> 00:02:42,468
是我 我演斯瓦希尔德
I got it! I'm Swanhilde!

40
00:02:42,484 --> 00:02:44,468
奥利演麦克白
Ollie Macbeth.

41
00:02:44,468 --> 00:02:48,464
本和克里斯提 你们都饰演白马王子
Ben and Christian, you'll both be dancing Prince Charming.

42
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,524
塔拉 你饰演火鸟
Tara, you'll be doing Firebird.

43
00:02:53,544 --> 00:02:56,496
我为你预约了威克斯医生
I'm making you an appointment to see Dr Wicks.

44
00:02:56,512 --> 00:02:58,512
然后是阿比盖尔
And Abigail...

45
00:02:58,532 --> 00:03:02,476
抱歉 你怎么能在我们不知道瑞贝卡有何要求的情况下
Sorry, how can you assign our final audition solos

46
00:03:02,496 --> 00:03:05,460
为我们安排最终试演的独舞节目呢
when we don't know what Rebecca is looking for?

47
00:03:13,452 --> 00:03:16,500
你不能指望靠一直涂精油来治好你的背
You can't keep applying heat cream and hope it magically fixes itself.

48
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,997
我对她的要求是只能低强度运动 
I'm putting her on low-impact, 

49
00:03:18,997 --> 00:03:20,508
不能做阿拉贝斯克舞姿和快速的舞蹈动作
no arabesques, no allegro.

50
00:03:18,997 --> 00:03:20,508
{\an8}阿拉贝斯克舞姿 单腿直立 一臂前伸 另一腿往后抬起 另一臂舒展扬起


51
00:03:20,528 --> 00:03:23,472
但试演不到三周就要开始了
But auditions are less than three weeks away.

52
00:03:23,492 --> 00:03:25,496
只是肌肉问题 我不会受伤的
It's just muscular. I'm not doing damage.

53
00:03:25,516 --> 00:03:28,496
难道你要等到受伤了才罢休
Don't you love it when they get their medical degrees?

54
00:03:28,516 --> 00:03:31,504
如果你从去年的事中吸取哪怕一点点的教训
If you've gained a skerrick of sense since last year,

55
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,500
你就应该听威克斯医生的话
you'll listen to Dr Wicks.

56
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,460
又来了
Again?

57
00:03:37,476 --> 00:03:41,464
一 二 三
One, two, three.

58
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:46,520
去问问杰弗里先生的名单是否还在
Go ask if Sir Jeffery's list went with him.

59
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,139
我还以为你已经迫不及待地上网查过了
I would have thought you'd be desperate to do some networking.

60
00:03:51,492 --> 00:03:55,488
还没人能通过跳麦克白的独舞进舞团的
No-one's ever gotten into the company dancing a Macbeth solo.

61
00:03:55,504 --> 00:03:57,492
这是事实 也是诅咒
It's fact, it's cursed.

62
00:03:57,512 --> 00:04:01,516
幸好我还有别的选择
It's a good thing I've got another option, then.

63
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,536
恭喜你获得了火鸟的角色 你的最爱之一 是吗
Congratulations on Firebird. One of your favourites, right?

64
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:09,476
你知道我没理由相信什么克里斯提会改头换面这种事吧
Do you realized I have no reason to trust this born-again Christian thing?

65
00:04:09,496 --> 00:04:11,516
- 没错 - 你不能靠"考虑一下吧"这种话
- Good line. - You can't say what you said

66
00:04:11,536 --> 00:04:14,524
就把过去一笔勾销
like it cancels out everything and go, 'Think it over.'

67
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,408
你要我怎么接受这种事
How do I have head space for that?

68
00:04:16,408 --> 00:04:18,528
说得对 你应该把精力集中在试演上
You're right. You should focus on auditions

69
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:21,468
这样我就能向你证明我有所改变了
while I prove to you I'm stepping up.

70
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:25,460
很高兴能听到你这么说 里德同学 过会儿来找我
Thrilled to hear it, Mr Reed. Come and find me later.

71
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,500
疏散工作做得不错 消防管理员向你致敬
Nice evacuation things. Your fire warden salutes you.

72
00:04:28,516 --> 00:04:30,456
相较于杰弗里先生
Compared to Sir Jeffery,

73
00:04:30,476 --> 00:04:32,492
你的审美观念是什么样的呢
how would you describe your aesthetic,

74
00:04:32,508 --> 00:04:35,476
毫无疑问更现代 对吗
more contemporary, surely?

75
00:04:35,492 --> 00:04:36,536
我的审美很简单
My aesthetic is simple.

76
00:04:37,456 --> 00:04:41,504
我想要全世界最出色的舞者 无论来自哪里
I want the best dancers on the planet, wherever they come from.

77
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,492
失陪
Excuse me.

78
00:04:47,508 --> 00:04:54,476
璐璐 在某些特殊情况下 速度比形式更重要
Lulu, in certain situations, speed is more important than form.

79
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,484
六 七 八
Six, seven, eight!

80
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,460
一 二 三 四 五 六 
One, two, three, four, five, six,

81
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,464

84
00:05:06,516 --> 00:05:08,524

85
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,500
一 二 三 四
And one, two, three, four...

86
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,532
各位潜在的备选舞者 我向你们致敬
Potential backup dancers, I salute you.

87
00:05:23,548 --> 00:05:26,528
谢谢你们没让我丢脸
Thanks for not embarrassing me.

88
00:05:26,548 --> 00:05:29,496
我们今晚通知复试的事
We'll be in contact tonight about call-back,

89
00:05:29,516 --> 00:05:36,508
所以不管做什么事 都别忘了带手机
so whatever you do, don't drop your phone in your coffee.

90
00:05:36,524 --> 00:05:41,480
嘿 我想说我是你的超级粉丝
Hey, I just want to say, huge fan.

91
00:05:41,496 --> 00:05:42,528
噢 谢谢
Oh, cheers.

92
00:05:42,548 --> 00:05:46,488
米卡才是最棒的 她跳的时候想不好看都难
Meeka's the best. It's hard not to look good doing a chory.

93
00:05:46,508 --> 00:05:50,496
是的 她同意参加我的巡演时我有点受宠若惊
I know. I'm slightly terrified she agreed to do my tour.

94
00:05:50,512 --> 00:05:52,480
我其实是说你的音乐
But I actually meant your music.

95
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,464
我做普拉提时一直听你的歌
You're all over my Pilates playlist.

96
00:05:54,484 --> 00:05:58,492
我貌似把你的网站地址发给了杰西来给她创作灵感
I may have sent Jess the link to your web channel for inspiration.

97
00:05:58,512 --> 00:06:01,512
太疯狂了 你可是杰西卡・麦尔白
That's crazy.I mean, You're Jessica Mauboy,

98
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:04,508
我这是废话
which you obviously know.

99
00:06:04,524 --> 00:06:06,520
这是否意味着我有复试的机会了
Does this mean I get a call-back?

100
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:10,460
备选演员的复试 我觉得目标可以再高一些
For backup dancing? I think we could aim higher.

101
00:06:13,488 --> 00:06:17,476
学年结束时你的奖学金也将停止发放
The end of the school year also means the end of your scholarship.

102
00:06:17,496 --> 00:06:20,496
- 你考虑过怎么赚取生活花销吗 - 当然
- Have you thought about how you'll cover living expenses? - Absolutely.

103
00:06:20,516 --> 00:06:23,528
我打算和国家芭蕾舞团签约
I plan on getting a contract with the National Ballet Company.

104
00:06:23,544 --> 00:06:26,520
你可能听说过我的计划
You might have heard of it.

105
00:06:26,536 --> 00:06:28,528
希望你能实现
I hope you do.

106
00:06:28,548 --> 00:06:31,500
但如果你没能如愿 最终巡演将会花费不少钱
If that doesn't eventuate, the audition circuit is expensive,

107
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,464
- 尤其是当你需要出国的时候 - 是的 当然
- particularly if you need to head overseas. - Right, of course.

108
00:06:36,484 --> 00:06:40,508
我为你找了些可以申请的补助金
I found some grants you might be eligible for.

109
00:06:40,528 --> 00:06:45,504
我不需要 我能找到一份工作的
I don't need them. I can get a job.

110
00:06:45,524 --> 00:06:48,504
我本该今年就去工作挣钱的
I should have been working this year, saving up.

111
00:06:48,524 --> 00:06:50,536
没人说要把你赶走
No-one is suggesting we throw you out.

112
00:06:51,456 --> 00:06:55,532
非常感谢 但你们为我做得够多的了
I appreciate that, but you guys have done enough.

113
00:06:57,508 --> 00:06:59,524
二 滑步 击足跳
Two. Glissade, cabriole.

114
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,488
蓄力
Gather for force.

115
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,540
爆发
Explode!

116
00:07:05,456 --> 00:07:08,452
你们慢了 跟上
You're behind the music. Come on.

117
00:07:08,468 --> 00:07:09,540
克里斯提 继续
Christian, keep up.

118
00:07:14,496 --> 00:07:15,544
本杰明
Benjamin!

119
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,464
我有个计划
I have a plan.

120
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:20,516
这边走
Come this way.

121
00:07:20,532 --> 00:07:22,472
我们需要安排多少次
How many of my unique

122
00:07:22,492 --> 00:07:24,488
单独授课
private coaching sessions shall we pencil in?

123
00:07:24,508 --> 00:07:27,504
我要自己完成这套舞蹈
I'm going to work through this one on my own.

124
00:07:27,524 --> 00:07:30,548
你和本都演白马王子 是我的主意
You and Ben both doing Prince Charming, that was my call.

125
00:07:31,468 --> 00:07:34,508
要是有其他合适的方式 我可以帮你争取一个
Either suits you a different way, I can help you find a unique take.

126
00:07:34,524 --> 00:07:36,460
这段独舞我没问题的
I'm good with the solo.

127
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,492
你不可能永远在我身边手把手指导吧
You're not going to be around forever to hold my hand.

128
00:07:39,508 --> 00:07:41,516
交给我了
I've got this one.

129
00:07:49,484 --> 00:07:51,472
看看赛斯吉娅
Look at Saskia.

130
00:07:51,488 --> 00:07:52,548
干嘛
Why?

131
00:07:54,452 --> 00:07:56,520
这是不是她折了脚踝那晚上呀
Oh! Is this the night she broke her ankle?

132
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:00,512
要是不让我排练 我要怎么达到这水准
How am I supposed to match that if I'm not allowed to rehearse?

133
00:08:00,532 --> 00:08:03,460
年度压轴大戏的主角
Lead role in the end-of-year production!

134
00:08:03,476 --> 00:08:05,536
选角机会千载难逢
The casting coup of the ages!

135
00:08:06,456 --> 00:08:09,504
拜托啦孩子们 别拐弯抹角了 你们有啥别有用心
Children, please. Can we just get to the ulterior motive?

136
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,472
全国各地的准毕业生们
School leavers around the country

137
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:12,853
都纵情于毕业恶作剧
are indulging in graduation pranks.

138
00:08:13,456 --> 00:08:15,520
三年级学生禁止做这种蠢事
Third-years are banned from such tomfoolery.

139
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,480
尽管冒着取消试镜资格的险
On pain of being excluded from auditions.

140
00:08:18,496 --> 00:08:21,480
但作为一个二年级学生
However, being a second-year...

141
00:08:21,496 --> 00:08:23,480
我有豁免惩罚的权利哦
I'm exempt from such punishment.

142
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,500
你就是最佳恶作剧代言人啦
You are the perfect pranker-by-proxy.

143
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,472
这就是你们正热衷的事情吗
This is what is occupying your attention,

144
00:08:29,488 --> 00:08:31,460
不该是新艺术指导吗
not the new artistic director?

145
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:36,464
这可是咱们的毕业仪式 怎么能不找点乐子
It's a rite of passage. The fun shouldn't have to die.

146
00:08:36,484 --> 00:08:41,492
本杰明 我真抱歉 我不能冒险惹雷恩老师生气
Benjamin, I'm sorry, but I can't risk Raine wrath.

147
00:08:41,508 --> 00:08:43,532
那就算你同意啦
So that's a yes?

148
00:08:43,548 --> 00:08:46,512
奥利弗 绝对不行
Oliver, it's a very firm no.

149
00:08:46,532 --> 00:08:52,516
我和韦斯做了调查 知道吗 瑞贝卡有人体运动学博士学位
Wes and I are researching. Do you know Rebecca has a PhD in kinesiology?

150
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,468
她可真是名副其实的舞蹈医生
She's literally a dance doctor.

151
00:08:54,488 --> 00:08:58,492
韦斯 你能不能劝劝她就花一小时
Wes, can you tell her that she can spend an hour

152
00:08:58,512 --> 00:09:00,548
在一场试镜中支援我演唱 就一首歌
to backup sing in one audition. One song.

153
00:09:01,468 --> 00:09:04,484
这完全没意义 你当然不会为了某个流行歌手的首演
It's pointless division. You're not going to throw away your company chance

154
00:09:04,504 --> 00:09:07,460
而放弃进军舞团的机会
to be the opening act of some pop star.

155
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,524
哀求她 奥利 四肢跪地
Beg for it, Ollie hands and knees.

156
00:09:14,476 --> 00:09:17,472
你真是个有天赋的演员
You're a very talented performer,

157
00:09:17,488 --> 00:09:22,516
你能让我表现更优秀
and you make me better than I am.

158
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:28,476
那你会帮我破解瑞贝卡之谜吗
Will you help me crack the Rebecca enigma?

159
00:09:44,524 --> 00:09:46,508
你想干嘛
What do you want?

160
00:09:46,528 --> 00:09:54,500
- 你忙着呢 - 我失业了 时间充沛得很
- You're busy. - I'm unemployed. I've got all the time in the world.

161
00:09:54,516 --> 00:09:56,472
我听到了流言 但是
I heard a rumour, but...

162
00:09:56,492 --> 00:10:00,492
官方说法是 我不适合新舞团
The official line is that I'm not a good fit for the new company.

163
00:10:00,512 --> 00:10:03,540
实际上是瑞贝卡迫不及待把杰弗里先生的宠信们清理出局
But really Rebecca couldn't wait to purge Sir Jeffery's favourites.

164
00:10:04,456 --> 00:10:05,524
我替你感到难过
I'm so sorry.

165
00:10:05,544 --> 00:10:11,508
董事会还知道我是张王牌 我会与之斗争的
The board still knows I'm a draw card. I'm going to fight this.

166
00:10:11,524 --> 00:10:14,480
那你需要些什么
So what do you need?

167
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,520
我得到了火鸟的角色 作为我的舞团试演片段
I've been given Firebird as my company audition piece.

168
00:10:17,536 --> 00:10:21,524
你跳得比谁都好
And You dance it better than anyone

169
00:10:21,544 --> 00:10:24,484
而且你也清楚如何避免受伤
and know how to work around an injury.

170
00:10:24,504 --> 00:10:28,532
我在想或许你能帮我
I was wondering if maybe you'd help me...

171
00:10:28,548 --> 00:10:31,460
作弊么
Cheat?

172
00:10:35,524 --> 00:10:38,468
我在想要不要把后雀跃换成
I was thinking of changing the cabriole derriere

173
00:10:38,488 --> 00:10:42,516
后背姿势更优美的动作 比如巴斯克舞步
to something more back-friendly like a saut de basque.

174
00:10:42,536 --> 00:10:46,484
要是你试试做比如伸展双臂这样的动作
If you do things like extend the phrasing of the releves,

175
00:10:46,504 --> 00:10:50,524
没人会注意到你的阿拉贝斯克姿势过低
no-one is going to care that the arabesque is lower.

176
00:10:50,544 --> 00:10:54,484
你有考虑过强度低一些的独舞吗
Have you considered doing a solo that's less intense?

177
00:10:54,504 --> 00:10:57,484
三年来我每周都跳六十小时
I've been dancing 60 hours a week for three years.

178
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,512
我要高强度而又戏剧性
I want to be intense and dramatic.

179
00:11:06,468 --> 00:11:08,015
可是从长远角度来看呢
What about the long term though?

180
00:11:08,015 --> 00:11:09,870
你逼迫自己忍受疼痛
You push yourself through the pain barrier

181
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,827
日复一日 年复一年 
day after day, year after year... 

182
00:11:11,827 --> 00:11:13,528
相信我 我可不推崇这么做
Trust me, I don't recommend it.

183
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:16,504
- 要是你不想帮我 - 听着
- If you don't want to help... - Listen.

184
00:11:16,524 --> 00:11:19,504
有个跟我同龄的女孩试镜跳了波尔赛弗涅
A girl in my year did Persephone for her audition.

185
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,468
我早就知道波尔赛弗涅了
I already know Persephone.

186
00:11:21,488 --> 00:11:23,781
我来学院之前就跳过了 太简单
I did it before I came to the academy. It's too easy.

187
00:11:23,781 --> 00:11:25,360
从技巧来看 是的
Technically, yes,

188
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,508
但是从艺术角度来看 你可以自由发挥
but artistically you could make it whatever you want.

189
00:11:29,524 --> 00:11:31,492
如果你非要跳火鸟
If you persist with Firebird,

190
00:11:31,512 --> 00:11:34,516
我帮不了你 我也不会帮你
I can't help you. I won't help you.

191
00:11:49,496 --> 00:11:51,452
显然她的下一个电影
So obviously a stunt

192
00:11:51,472 --> 00:11:54,452
就只能靠舞蹈特技了
to cash in on her next straight-to-Netflix movie.

193
00:11:54,472 --> 00:11:56,524
雷恩老师 璐璐既然扮演我最好的朋友
Miss Raine, as Lulu is playing my best friend,

194
00:11:56,544 --> 00:11:58,418
能不能麻烦你告诉她入戏点 
could you tell her to get in character? 

195
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:02,476
凯特莉娜 你重心不稳
Katrina You're tottering.

196
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:07,484
痛得好爽 真舒服
Oh! Good pain, good pain!

197
00:12:09,536 --> 00:12:12,492
关于恶作剧日
So, Muck Up Day.

198
00:12:12,512 --> 00:12:16,476
还记得去年怎么恶搞我那群敬爱的同班同学的吗
Remember last year's war against my esteemed classmates?

199
00:12:16,496 --> 00:12:19,219
- 当然 - 想必你有什么敢想却不敢做的
- Of course. - Presumably you had battle plans

200
00:12:19,219 --> 00:12:21,536
作战计划咯
that were never enacted.

201
00:12:22,452 --> 00:12:24,484
暴打他们一顿
Dust them off.

202
00:12:25,488 --> 00:12:29,508
瑞贝卡说他们需要的是全世界最出色的舞者
Rebecca said they're looking for the best dancers on the planet.

203
00:12:29,528 --> 00:12:32,476
潜台词就是她要对学院不忠
Subtext - she has no loyalty to the academy,

204
00:12:32,496 --> 00:12:34,516
这说得通 因为她从来就没对学院忠诚过
which makes sense, 'cause she never got in.

205
00:12:34,536 --> 00:12:40,544
- 我们等会儿再说她 你只要闭嘴 漂漂亮亮的就好 - 真粗鲁
- We'll get to Rebecca later. Just shut up and look pretty. - Rude!

206
00:13:44,516 --> 00:13:48,524
# 你自以为无所不知 你自以为无所不晓 #
You think you've got it, boy You think you know it all

207
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,508
# 世界如此之大 如此邪恶 #
This world is big and bad

208
00:13:50,528 --> 00:13:53,456
# 谁都难料未来怎样 #
You don't know what it's got in store

209
00:13:53,476 --> 00:13:56,548
# 激烈斗争吧 正如你遇见我 #
Got to fight so hard like you see me

210
00:13:57,464 --> 00:14:00,548
# 就从今晚开始 #
And it's starting tonight

211
00:14:02,652 --> 00:14:04,436
# 把音量调高 让音响爆破 #
So turn it up Let the speakers blow

212
00:14:04,556 --> 00:14:06,520
# 熊熊燃烧吧 点燃小宇宙 #
Burn it up We can make fire

213
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,456
# 把音量调高 让音响爆破 #
Turn it up Let the speakers blow

214
00:14:09,476 --> 00:14:11,464
# 每人都知道奥利无敌 #
Everybody know Ollie got the flow

215
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:13,508
# 今夜属于我 无处可逃 #
I own the night There's nowhere to run

216
00:14:13,524 --> 00:14:15,536
# 无处可逃 #
And nowhere to hide

217
00:14:16,452 --> 00:14:18,472
# 准备充分 #
I'm ready

218
00:14:18,488 --> 00:14:22,452
# 没人能打倒我 #
No-one can't bring me down

219
00:14:22,472 --> 00:14:26,520
# 我头戴皇冠 我是最棒的 #
I will hold the crown for the best around

220
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:30,464
# 躺在地板上 再给我更多 #
So let's take it to the floor Girl, give me more

221
00:14:30,484 --> 00:14:34,508
# 我势不可挡 #
Ain't nobody going to stop me No

222
00:14:34,528 --> 00:14:38,508
# 你无法阻止我 你无法阻止我 #
You can't stop me now You can't stop me now

223
00:14:38,524 --> 00:14:40,528
# 我要打败你 #
I'm going to hold you down

224
00:14:40,548 --> 00:14:44,516
# 你无法阻止我 你无法阻止我 #
You can't stop me now You can't stop me now

225
00:14:44,532 --> 00:14:46,504
# 你无法阻止我 #
You can't stop me now

226
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,520
# 我要打败你 #
I'm going to hold you down

227
00:14:48,536 --> 00:14:51,508
#　你无法阻止我 #
You can't stop me now.

228
00:14:57,524 --> 00:15:00,512
我正抱着杰西卡・麦尔白呢
I'm supporting Jessica Mauboy!

229
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:05,484
今年真难熬 这是我首次胜利
It's been such a tough year. This is the first win I've had.

230
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:08,452
阿比盖尔 我们还未谋面呢
Abigail, we really didn't meet yet.

231
00:15:08,468 --> 00:15:09,524
太惊艳了
So amazing.

232
00:15:09,544 --> 00:15:12,532
- 我们会找个优秀的替代者 - 什么
- We'll find a great replacement. - Sorry?

233
00:15:13,452 --> 00:15:15,484
大约六个人 站满整个舞台
Maybe half a dozen. Fill out the stage.

234
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,496
但你们是双人表演啊
But you're a duo.

235
00:15:17,512 --> 00:15:19,516
不是 我是独唱
No, I'm a solo artist,

236
00:15:19,536 --> 00:15:22,540
再说阿比盖尔已经忙于另一场试镜了
and Abigail is already tied up to another audition process.

237
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:25,512
我们就要这个组合
We want this.

238
00:15:25,528 --> 00:15:27,516
就这个
Just this.

239
00:15:32,484 --> 00:15:35,452
感觉怎么样
How is it feeling?

240
00:15:35,472 --> 00:15:38,500
还好 就是独奏部分太简单了
Fine. It's just, the solo is too straightforward.

241
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:42,488
没办法通过它到达...
There's nothing to push through to get to...

242
00:15:42,504 --> 00:15:44,524
哪里
Where?

243
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,488
我称它为神奇的地方
I call it, my magic place.

244
00:15:48,492 --> 00:15:53,504
你知道的...就是一切突然间起作用的所在
You must know...where everything suddenly works.

245
00:15:53,524 --> 00:15:58,484
灯光暗下去 只剩我和音乐
The lights fade and it's just me and the music.

246
00:15:58,504 --> 00:16:04,500
塔拉 凭经验而言 这种时刻不可靠
Tara, speaking from experience, those moments can be unreliable.

247
00:16:04,516 --> 00:16:07,468
这就是我为什么喜欢跳舞
They're also why I love dancing.

248
00:16:07,488 --> 00:16:09,644
这很奇妙 喜欢归喜欢
That's fantastic. Love it all you like,

249
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:13,019
但是作为专业舞者 得看你在最糟糕的时刻如何应对
but being a professional is about what you do on your worst night,

250
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:15,234
如果在你的第一百场演出上
when it's your hundredth performance,

251
00:16:15,234 --> 00:16:16,814
乐队演奏的太快了
the orchestra is playing too fast,

252
00:16:16,814 --> 00:16:18,295
你的演出服掉了
your costume falls off.

253
00:16:18,295 --> 00:16:21,227
你不能停下来告诉观众说
You can't just stop and turn to the audience and say,

254
00:16:21,227 --> 00:16:24,153
对不起...奇迹没有发生
"Sorry...no magic."

255
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,197
那怎么办 就那么敷衍过去
So, what, you just fake it?

256
00:16:28,197 --> 00:16:30,762
不是敷衍 你得相信自己已经做足了功课
No. You trust that you've done your homework,

257
00:16:30,762 --> 00:16:32,951
每一个动作你都烂熟于心
that you've crafted your performance

258
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:34,897
而且让你的每一个舞步充满意义
and infused meaning into every step.

259
00:16:37,118 --> 00:16:40,492
这才是成人的做法
That's how the grown-ups do it.

260
00:16:45,452 --> 00:16:48,472
也就是说你清醒过来咯
Does this mean you've found the head space?

261
00:16:48,488 --> 00:16:49,548
你在哪儿
Where are you?

262
00:17:00,472 --> 00:17:01,504
你在当救生员
You're a lifeguard?

263
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,516
是的 我正在培训中
I'm in training to be one, yes.

264
00:17:03,536 --> 00:17:06,459
没安排不代表做错了
Just because you didn't organise it doesn't make it wrong.

265
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:09,654
你不是说要进舞团吗
What happened to your speech about getting into the company?

266
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:11,969
你是真想加入 还是只不过做做样子
Did you want to get in or did you just say that for effect?

267
00:17:11,969 --> 00:17:16,789
- 我百分之九十真想加入 - 克里斯提
- I'm 90% sure I want to. - Christian!

268
00:17:16,789 --> 00:17:20,049
如果我没能如愿 我需要钱作为缓冲
If I don't get in, I'll need some cash as a buffer.

269
00:17:22,524 --> 00:17:25,468
我快下班了
My shift is almost over.

270
00:17:25,468 --> 00:17:29,544
你何不帮我改进一下救生技能呢
Why don't you help me with some rescue skills?

271
00:17:34,504 --> 00:17:37,512
也许我们需要设置话题禁区
Maybe we need conversation embargoes,

272
00:17:37,532 --> 00:17:40,464
不谈敏感话题
dangerous subjects we put into the no-fly zone.

273
00:17:40,484 --> 00:17:42,520
比如你的事业和我的期望
Like your career and my expectations?

274
00:17:42,536 --> 00:17:45,500
你没有试着纠正我
You don't try and fix me.

275
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,512
你也没有回避话题 那你告诉我你是怎么想的
You don't retreat. You tell me what you're thinking.

276
00:17:48,528 --> 00:17:50,540
现在
Like right now?

277
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:53,488
你想知道我怎么想的吗
You want to know what I'm thinking?

278
00:18:02,516 --> 00:18:04,528
神奇的时刻
Kind of a magic moment.

279
00:18:04,544 --> 00:18:07,492
我听说这不可靠
I hear those are unreliable.

280
00:18:17,508 --> 00:18:20,528
合约上只有经济舱旅行
They've only contracted economy-class travel.

281
00:18:20,548 --> 00:18:27,464
我们需要个代理人吗 你能别假装你在读吗
Think we need an agent? Can you stop pretending to read that?

282
00:18:30,508 --> 00:18:33,536
现在我来了 你想让我怎么挖丑闻
I'm here now. How do you want to dig for dirt?

283
00:18:37,496 --> 00:18:41,540
严格地说 这次巡演已经到手了
Strictly for argument's sake, this tour is a bird in the hand.

284
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,480
每晚要在成千上万的观众前表演
It's performing in front of thousands every night.

285
00:18:44,496 --> 00:18:45,528
是个不错的工作
It's a career.

286
00:18:45,548 --> 00:18:48,791
- 而舞团那边完全是个未知数 - 你是说...
- The company is a total unknown. - You're saying...

287
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:50,650
如果我们拒绝这个工作 瑞贝卡又不要咱
How stupid would we feel if we turned this offer down

288
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:52,224
那将是多么愚蠢的选择
and Rebecca takes none of us?

289
00:19:08,468 --> 00:19:09,508
怎么了
What?

290
00:19:09,528 --> 00:19:13,524
没事 我正准备和你说说我的独舞
Doesn't matter. I was going to tell you about my solo,

291
00:19:13,544 --> 00:19:18,476
但我们应该把它列为禁区 我很焦虑
but we should put that on the banned list. I get anxious.

292
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:20,492
这太傻了
This is stupid.

293
00:19:20,512 --> 00:19:23,464
我突然不知道怎么跟你说了
I suddenly don't know what to say to you.

294
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,484
我们有话题雷区
There are minefields.

295
00:19:26,504 --> 00:19:29,516
我们真能遵守规则 不以争吵告终吗
Can we really do rules so we don't end up fighting?

296
00:19:29,532 --> 00:19:31,516
嘿 过来
Hey, come here.

297
00:19:34,516 --> 00:19:37,544
你有没有想过 如果事情进展顺利
Have you ever thought that if it was going to work...

298
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:41,492
现在就已经顺利发生了吗
It would have happened by now?

299
00:19:41,512 --> 00:19:47,460
我们并不是没试过 试了好多次了
It's not like we haven't tried lots of times.

300
00:19:47,476 --> 00:19:48,948
我紧紧抓着那些神奇的时刻不放手
I cling onto those magic moments,

301
00:19:48,948 --> 00:19:51,536
而在剩下的时间里 我们都在争吵
then the rest of the time we just fight.

302
00:19:51,536 --> 00:19:55,460
伤害对方 我知道
And hurt each other. I know.

303
00:19:58,472 --> 00:19:59,524
所以你觉得...
So do you think it's...

304
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,500
结束了吗
Over?

305
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:05,452
你觉得呢
Do you?

306
00:20:05,472 --> 00:20:07,484
我们能不能往回倒退五分钟
Can't we just rewind five minutes?

307
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,472
要是...
What if...

308
00:20:14,488 --> 00:20:16,492
什么
What?

309
00:20:16,512 --> 00:20:20,544
我觉得 我不会再像爱你那样
I don't think I'm ever going to love anyone

310
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:24,472
爱任何人了
the way I love you.

311
00:20:32,492 --> 00:20:36,540
我禁不住被电影 书本 和芭蕾故事里的
I can't help feeling manipulated by all those love stories

312
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:40,500
所有那些爱情故事左右
in all those movies and books and ballets.

313
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:44,548
他们教给我们 如果你经受了足够的考验 到最后就会成功
They teach that if you suffer enough, it works out in the end.

314
00:20:45,464 --> 00:20:47,460
我想我应该退休
I think I'm going to retire.

315
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:51,504
什么 这世界上任何舞团都会抢着要你的
What? Any company in the world would take you in an instant.

316
00:20:51,524 --> 00:20:56,452
我厌倦了每天早晨喝咖啡和止痛药了
I'm sick of starting each morning with coffee and a painkiller.

317
00:20:56,472 --> 00:21:00,460
我不想再这样逼自己了
I don't want to push myself so hard anymore.

318
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,484
波尔塞福涅...你要用每一个舞步来讲述这个故事
Anyway, Persephone... you need to tell the story with every step.

319
00:21:04,504 --> 00:21:07,468
我猜关键词是爱情故事
I guess the key phrase is, love story.

320
00:21:07,488 --> 00:21:10,540
我不能再活在奇迹 虚幻的世界里
I can't live in a magic, made-up world any longer.

321
00:21:14,472 --> 00:21:17,528
是时候强迫自己活在当下
It's time to force myself to be present,

322
00:21:17,544 --> 00:21:20,460
对待爱情像最好的舞蹈一样
treat love like the best dancing,

323
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,544
在简单中追求不费力 没有痛苦 和美丽
aim for effortless, pain-free, beautiful in its simplicity.

324
00:21:34,548 --> 00:21:39,500
如果是拿着名单的杰弗里先生 我会说我愿意参加巡演
If it was Sir Jeffery with his list, I'd say we take the tour

325
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,468
但是是瑞贝卡 我们什么都难以预料
but with Rebecca we still don't know anything.

326
00:21:43,488 --> 00:21:48,544
好吧 调查暂且不谈 你对瑞贝卡的直觉怎样
OK, research aside, what are your gut feelings about Rebecca?

327
00:21:53,468 --> 00:21:55,464
我认为...
I think...

328
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:02,532
..我觉得她爱芭蕾胜于一切
..I think she loves ballet more than anything.

329
00:22:07,472 --> 00:22:11,488
反面 不惜一切代价进军舞团
Tails, you risk everything on the company.

330
00:22:11,504 --> 00:22:14,476
正面 参加和麦尔白的巡演
Heads, tour with Mauboy.

331
00:22:22,476 --> 00:22:24,480
三局两胜
Best of three?

332
00:22:24,496 --> 00:22:25,528
请井然有序地
Nice and orderly, please.

333
00:22:25,548 --> 00:22:29,460
径直穿过紧急通道
Straight through the emergency exit.

334
00:22:37,468 --> 00:22:39,548
伙计 我们该走了
Mate, we've got to go.

335
00:22:41,472 --> 00:22:46,480
我知道我不值得这个角色 但是我要试演白马王子
I don't deserve it, but if I'm going to be Prince Charming,

336
00:22:46,496 --> 00:22:49,508
就需要你的帮助
I'm going to need your help.

337
00:22:49,524 --> 00:22:51,476
来吧 走
Come on. Let's go.

338
00:22:54,508 --> 00:22:56,548
波尔塞福涅太乏味了
Persephone is far too prosaic.

339
00:22:57,164 --> 00:22:59,036
我不认为 我会让它很独特的
I disagree. I'll make it special.

340
00:22:59,456 --> 00:23:01,488
不 你要听从指示 别着急
No, you'll take the time as instructed,

341
00:23:01,504 --> 00:23:03,468
然后跳我选的独舞
then do the solo I selected.

342
00:23:03,488 --> 00:23:05,456
尊敬的雷恩老师 我不答应
Respectfully, I won't, Miss Raine.

343
00:23:05,476 --> 00:23:11,484
我会继续和赛斯吉娅合作 从她那儿我学到很多
I'll keep working with Saskia. I'm learning a lot from her.

344
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,468
各位 恶作剧日快乐 
Happy Muck Up Day, everyone.

345
00:23:26,544 --> 00:23:29,488
凯特莉娜・卡拉马科夫 过来 就现在
Katrina Karamakov! Here, now!

346
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:40,536
这是我们最后的码头大战 三周后我们就要毕业了
This is our last wharf battle. We graduate in three weeks.

347
00:23:43,484 --> 00:23:46,548
游戏开始了 塔拉・韦伯斯特 游戏开始了
Game on, Tara Webster. Game on.
