1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,760
"超感神探" 前情提要...
Previously on "The Mentalist"...

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,760
她说红约翰左肩上
She told me Red John has a tattoo

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,660
有个纹身... 三个点
on his left shoulder... three dots.

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,600
这就是我的筹码
That's my leverage.

5
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,260
把五个嫌疑人同时
Gather all five suspects together

6
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,000
聚在一个地方
at the same place, same time,

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,230
然后检查他们是否有纹身
and then start checking for the tattoo.

8
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:15,400
如何做到?
How do we do that?

9
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,030
- 周四晚上八点见  - 好吧
- Meet me at 8:00 on Thursday night.  - Fine.

10
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,460
周四晚上八点
Thursday night at 8:00.

11
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,860
- 我需要你帮个忙  - 好的 没问题
- I'll need your help.  - Well, then you've got it.

12
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24,000
如果你不出现 他会觉得你就是红约翰
If you don't show up, he will assume you're Red John.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,530
如果我去了 你和Jane就能
If I do this, will you and Jane drop

14
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,360
不再纠结"我是红约翰"这回事了?
the whole that "I'm Red John" business?

15
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,560
一劳永逸
For once and for all.

16
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,130
你们真觉得能查到他了?
You really think you've got him?

17
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,160
- 是的  - 你们结案的时候我要在场
- I do.  - I want to be there when you end this.

18
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,630
我正等着你这么说呢
I was hoping you'd say that.

19
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:37,060
红约翰
Red John.

20
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,200
我非常愿意
Nothing would give me more pleasure

21
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,200
今晚去见你
than to be with you there tonight.

22
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,460
红约翰... 有纹身
Red John... has a tattoo.

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,430
在左臂上纹了三个点
Three dots on his left arm.

24
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:53,130
你们所有人...
And you all...

25
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,860
都要让我看一下...
are gonna show me...

26
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,160
现在
now.

27
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:03,900
开始吧
Let's go. Come on.

28
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,900
这就对了 脱下衣服
That's it. Take it off.

29
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,630
真是一派胡言
Nonsense.

30
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,630
很好
Very good.

31
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,130
不是你想的那样
It's not what you think.

32
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:32,960
你找错人了
You got it wrong.

33
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,930
我不是红约翰
I'm not Red John.

34
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,030
Patrick 等一下 Patrick!
Patrick, wait. Patrick!

35
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,200
看... 这里
Look... Here.

36
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,600
看
Look.

37
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,000
站起来
On your feet.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,660
到他俩那边
Over with those two.

39
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,400
哦... 天啊
Oh... God.

40
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,860
你们待在这里
You stay there.

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,400
你们三个...
Okay, you three...

42
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,560
对着墙... 站好
Over against that wall... now.

43

啊!
Aah!

48
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,760
呼叫消防部队和紧急医疗小组
Call the fire department and EMTs.

49
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,830
告知他们这里有伤员数名
Let them know that there's multiple casualties,

50
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,530
还有拦好警戒线
and set up a perimeter.

51
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,360
把你的手电给我 我... 我进去看看
Give me your flashlight. I... I'm going in.

52
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,330
Smith探员
Agent Smith.

53
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:28,800
Smith探员 我是Teresa Lisbon
Agent Smith, it's Teresa Lisbon.

54
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,860
- 你还好吧?  - 发生什么了?
- Are you okay?  - What happened?

55
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,660
发生了一起爆炸 紧急医疗小组正火速赶来
There was an explosion. The EMTs are on their way.

56
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,160
他们会来救你的
They're gonna help you.

57
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,300
- 不许动!  - 怎么了?
- Don't move!  - What?

58
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,900
- 把手举起来 不然我就开枪了! 快把手举起来!  - 喔 喔 喔...
- Put your hands in the air, or I'll shoot! Do it!  - Whoa, whoa, whoa...

59
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,330
听着 我不知道你在说什么
Okay, listen, I don't know what you're talking about.

60
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:46,830
你一定是搞错了
You're clearly making a big mistake.

61
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,500
啊!
Aah! 

62
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:59,700
Smith往哪边去了?
Which way did Smith go? 

63
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,060
天啊 是你啊 Lisbon
Oh, my God, Lisbon.

64
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,830
咱们得找到Smith 他就是红约翰
We have to find Smith. He's Red John.

65
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,560
啊... 我去叫人来帮忙
Ah... I'll get help.

66
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,360
Jane啊?
Jane?

67
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,800
听得到吗?
Can you hear me?

68
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,530
Jane? 醒醒
Jane? Come on.

69
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,530
超感神探 第六季第7集

70
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,100
你还好吗?
You okay?

71
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,330
我没事
I'm fine.

72
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,060
医生说Jane的情况趋于稳定了
The doctors say Jane's stable.

73
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,160
没有什么重大损伤
There's no major trauma or anything.

74
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,900
只是还处于昏迷罢了
He's just not awake.

75
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,230
他们找到了三个人的遗体
They found the remains of three people.

76
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,330
基本确认分别是Bret Stiles 还有Ray Haffner
Positive I.D.s for Bret Stiles, Ray Haffner,

77
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:07,700
和Thomas Mcallister
and Thomas Mcallister.

78
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,960
你确定吗? 我还以为
Are you sure? I would think

79
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,530
连核武器都弄不死Bret Stiles呢
Bret Stiles would survive a nuclear attack.

80
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:12,330
尸体都烧焦了
The bodies are all burnt to a crisp,

81
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:14,760
但技术组还是找到了对应的DNA进行测试
but the crime techs did spot DNA tests.

82
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,730
验尸间将其比对以往就医记录
Coroner's office checked it against medical records.

83
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,330
Stiles Haffner 还有Mcallister都确认死亡
Stiles, Haffner, and Mcallister are all positively dead.

84
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,160
呃 那Smith呢? 有没有人目击?
Uh, what about Smith? Any sightings?

85
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,900
暂时没有 Rigsby和Van Pelt在查
Not yet. Rigsby and Van Pelt are on it.

86
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,600
嗯
Hmm.

87
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,800
头儿?
Sir?

88
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,230
- 啊 就觉得在这儿能找到你  - 您没事吧?
- Ah, thought I might find you here.  - Are you all right?

89
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,560
呃 我没事 不过我倒是想喝杯咖啡
Uh, I'm fine. I could use a cup of coffee, actually.

90
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,060
你能去帮我泡一杯吗?
Would you go and get me one?

91
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,460
我们正要组织对Smith的搜寻工作
We're just about to coordinate the manhunt for Smith.

92
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,060
那你就去把他抓来啊
Well, you should just go and get him.

93
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,030
我想留在这儿 头儿
Well, I'd like to stay here, sir.

94
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,730
Cho他们... 能搞定的
Well, are... Cho and the team... They can handle it.

95
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,160
你这是在公然违抗命令?
Are you refusing a direct order?

96
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,230
当然不是
Well, no.

97
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,460
- 不 我只是想留在这陪他  - 你... 你就不能听我的话吗?
- No, I just want to stay here with him.  - Wh... why don't you listen a little more closely?

98
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,900
我在命令你即刻离开这
I am ordering you to get out there,

99
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,400
把你的小组组织好 去抓Smith
put your team together, and get Smith.

100
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,460
Jane? Jane? 该死 那个呼叫按钮去哪了?
Jane? Jane? Where's the damn call button?

101
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,100
我... 我去把护士叫来
I'll... I'll get the nurse.

102
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,360
Jane啊
Jane.

103
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,760
嘿
Hey.

104
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,960
我们推测红约翰带了炸弹来
Our working theory is that Red John brought in the bomb

105
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,500
想置Jane和其他嫌疑人于死地
to kill Jane and the other suspects.

106
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,830
好吧 可是怎么做到的呢?
Okay, but how?

107
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:18,000
可能是红约翰将炸弹藏在了自己身上
Chances are, Red John snuck the bomb in on his person.

108
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,800
技术组从墙里挖出了
Crime techs have pulled fragments of the bomb casings

109
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,600
弹壳的碎片... 非常小的碎片
from the walls... very small fragments.

110
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,560
这说明他带的炸药是高密集 高火力的
This tells us that the explosive was dense, high-powered.

111
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,100
听起来不像是自制的
That doesn't sound homemade.

112
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,360
不 我认为是军用级别的
No. Military grade's my bet,

113
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,630
也就是说有迹可循
which means it could be traceable.

114
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:31,200
最有可能是这些地方来的
These are the most likely sources.

115
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,030
查一查其中有没有
Check for any recent thefts

116
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,200
- 最近失窃或遗失的炸药  - 没问题 这就去查
- of missing explosives from any of them.  - All right, will do.

117
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,660
- 有线索了?  - 嗯
- Got something?  - Yeah.

118
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,300
Lisbon在Smith逃走前给了他一枪
Lisbon wounded Smith before he escaped.

119
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,830
他现在身上中了一弹
He's walking around with a bullet.

120
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,160
医院接受枪伤病人时都要报告警局的
Oh. Well, hospitals have to declare gunshot wounds,

121
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,460
所以他不能去正规的急诊室
so he can't go to an ER.

122
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,960
所以他需要找个能保持缄默的医生
Right, so he needs a doctor who'll keep quiet.

123
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,560
萨克拉门托这里是Smith的地盘
Smith's based here in Sacramento,

124
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,030
我查了查他以前在这附近办的案子
so I looked into some of his old cases around town.

125
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,900
去年在南萨克拉门托 一支武装小组逮捕了
He was part of a task force that arrested

126
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,100
一个叫Alek Lavrov的医生 而他便是小组一员
Dr. Alek Lavrov last year in South Sac.

127
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,830
还有一名违法开奥施康定的Feelgood医生
A Dr. Feelgood writing illegal oxycontin scripts.

128
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,830
- 然后?  - 然后案子不了了之
- So?  - So the case went bad,

129
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,760
证据也没了 Lavrov无罪开释
evidence was lost, and Lavrov walked.

130
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,460
所以Smith一定知道去哪儿找
So Smith knows exactly where to find a doctor

131
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,830
不会跟警察告密的医生 很好 咱们去看看
who won't talk to the cops. Okay, let's go check it out.

132
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,900
你找错人了
It's not what you think.

133
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,930
我不是红约翰
I'm not Red John.

134
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,200
Patrick 等一下 看
Patrick, wait. Look.

135
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,760
欢迎回来
Welcome back.

136
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,130
Lisbon啊
Lisbon.

137
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,660
你房子里发生了一起爆炸
There was an explosion at your house.

138
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,030
我昏迷多长时间了?

00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,760
你喜欢给别人带来痛苦?
Do you like causing pain?

278
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,030
我这辈子从没打过任何一个女人
I never hit a woman in my life.

279
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,060
你是否属于一个由警察
Do you belong to a secret organization of cops

280
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,900
和其他政府官员组成的秘密组织?
and other government officials?

281
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,100
看来是的
Yes.

282
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,360
你曾为这个组织
You've committed crimes

283
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,060
犯过罪
on behalf of that organization before.

284
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,760
对吧?
Right?

285
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:23,260
Smith探员也是成员之一...
Agent Smith is a member also...

286
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,100
对吧?
right?

287
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,560
组织派你到医生那里
The organization sent you to the doctor's office

288
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,200
杀了他... 对吧?
to kill him... right?

289
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,900
加州调查局局长Gail Bertram也是成员之一
CBI Director Gail Bertram is also a member.

290
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,030
你不知道
You don't know.

291
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,800
级别太低 权限不够是吧?
Too low on the totem pole, huh?

292
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,060
Reede Smith探员是红约翰
Agent Reede Smith is Red John.

293
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:46,200
也不知道
Don't know.

294
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,160
Gail Bertram是红约翰
Gail Bertram's Red John.

295
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:52,360
还是不知道
Don't know.

296
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:56,830
你肩膀上的那个纹身是入会标志
That tattoo on your shoulder is the membership sign.

297
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,600
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

298
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,860
我又说对了
Right again.

299
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,630
还有个口令...
There's a password, too...

300
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:08,860
你们在碰头或者...
something you say as a greeting or a...

301
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,760
求救时说的
distress signal.

302
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:13,700
"老虎 老虎"
"Tiger, tiger."

303
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,530
从我脑袋里滚出去
Get out of my head.

304
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,460
一个坏警察构成的秘密组织
A secret society of dirty cops.

305
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:23,060
而红约翰是成员之一
And Red John's a member.

306
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,460
还有Partridge
Partridge.

307
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,130
他在死前跟我说了"老虎 老虎"
He said "Tiger, tiger" to me right before he died.

308
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,500
嗯 没错 没错
Hmm. Yes. Yes.

309
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,260
他在向你求救
He was asking for help

310
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,400
希望你万一也是成员之一
in the hopes that you were a member.

311
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,600
但他要是有纹身的话
But if he had a tattoo,

312
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,200
尸检报告里应该会写啊
it would have been in the autopsy report.

313
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,660
档案是可以造假的
Well, you can't trust a file.

314
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,900
眼见为实
We have to see it.

315
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,660
我派Cho去查尸体的下落
I'll have Cho track down the body.

316
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,500
但Partridge现在可能已经埋了
But Partridge could be buried by now.

317
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,030
那就让Cho带上铲子
Well, have Cho bring a shovel.

318
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,730
已经派人在找Smith 而Bertram跑了
The team's looking for Smith, Bertram's on the run.

319
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:48,060
到底谁是红约翰?
So who's Red John?

320
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,930
是Bertram还是Smith?
Is it Bertram or Smith?

321
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,660
我得直视他们的眼睛才行
I need to look them both in the eye.

322
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,830
验尸官大概两天前把尸体送了过来
Yeah, the coroner released his body, like, two days ago.

323
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:00,400
- 是谋杀案受害者吧?  - 没错
- Murder victim, huh?  - Yeah.

324
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,630
我猜也是 所以验尸官才拖了这么久
I figured. That's why we held him for so long.

325
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:05,230
还好你今天来了
Good thing you got here today.

326
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:07,360
明天他就烧得剩不下多少了
Tomorrow there won't be much left of him to look at.

327
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,930
来吧
Here we go.

328
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:10,260
Brett Partridge是吧
Brett Partridge.

329
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,500
帮我一把 好吗?
Give me a hand, huh?

330
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,230
随便看吧
He's all yours.

331
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,860
把刀给我
Give me your knife.

332
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,930
火化之前要给他们穿戴整齐
They dress 'em before we burn 'em.

333
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:46,460
我可不知道为什么
Don't ask me why.

334
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:04,060
Cho发来张图片
Cho sent a picture.

335
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,760
这是什么意思?
What does it mean?

336
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,400
你觉得呢?
What do you think it means?

337
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,100
Smith那边怎么回事?
What happened with Smith?

338
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,460
在医生那里差点让他们抓住了
They almost got him at his doctor's office.

339
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,260
那个加州调查局的小组突然出现
That CBI team showed up.

340
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,960
Smith逃之夭夭了
Smith's in the wind.

341
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,760
逃得真快
That's a good place to be.

342
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,160
我在这有点事要办
I've got some business in here,

343
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,630
在这儿等我
so wait for me.

344
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,700
啊 谢谢 Tomas先生
Ah. Thank you,Mr. Thomas.

345
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,100
有日子没见着您了
We haven't seen you for a while.

346
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,960
是啊 很高兴见到你
Yeah. It's nice to see you.

347
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,960
Smith现在可能在任何地方
Smith could be anywhere by now.

348
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,030
我试着追踪过他手机的GPS信号
I tried to trace the GPS Signal on his cell phone.

349
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,530
好几个小时没动静了
It's been dead for hours.

350
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:49,700
他那样的联邦调查局问题探员手头肯定会有预付费的备用机
A dirty FBI agent like him has to have a burner.

351
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,100
Lavrov医生说他没来得及给Smith缝好线
Dr. Lavrov says he didn't get the chance to sew Smith up.

352
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,700
他现在身上仍然有枪伤
He's still walking around with a bullet wound.

353
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,160
所以无论他在哪 情况都不妙
So he's in a bad way wherever he is.

354
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,030
总会有人发现他的
He'll get picked up by someone eventually.

355
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,900
是啊 但要是哪个警察找到他...
Yeah, but any cop who finds him...

356
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,200
太可怕了 我们谁也不能相信了
This is scary. We can't trust anyone.

357
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:12,730
没错
Nope.

358
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,430
啊 啊
Aah. Aah.

359
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,460
我是Van Pelt探员
Agent Van Pelt.

360
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,800
你得帮我
You gotta help me.

361
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,060
是Smith探员
Agent Smith.

362
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,630
他们要杀我
They're gonna kill me.

363
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:58,960
我要投降
I wanna surrender.

364
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,600
你在哪?
Where are you?

365
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:05,700
在市中心 叫Cho过去 他应该在附近
Downtown. Call Cho. He should be close.

366
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,030
好的 我们这就到
Okay, we're on our way.

367
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,600
Smith向加州调查局求助了
Smith reached out to CBI.

368
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,230
他用了组织给他的备用机
He used the burner the association gave him.

369
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,400
我们都听到了
We were listening.

370
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,030
他要自首
He's turning himself in.

371
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,560
是啊 叛徒
Yeah. Rat.

372
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,300
那个加州调查局小组正赶往那边接他
That CBI team is on its way to get him now.

373
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,000
不能让他落到那帮人手里 他在哪?
Well, we can't have that. Where is he?

374
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,930
就在离这不远的巷子里 算咱们运气好
He's in an alley not too far from here. Our good luck.

375
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,160
他知道你是谁吗?
Does he know who you are?

376
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,760
不知道 在医生那里他没见到我
Nah, he didn't see me at the doctor's office.

377
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,560
很好 那你现在就装成一名加州调查局探员
All right. You are now a CBI Agent.

378
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,360
想一起来吗? 应该会很有意思
You want to come along? Could be fun.

379
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,430
不了 我还有其它事要办
No. I have some other business to take care of.

380
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:42,200
- 一会儿见  - 没问题
- We'll meet up later.  - You got it.

381
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,100
这次能别再把事情搞砸吗?
Can you get it right this time?

382
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,100
明白!
Yes, Sir!

383
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:08,930
啊!
Aah!

384
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,260
嗯...
Mm...

385
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,200
Reede Smith探员?
Agent Reede Smith?

386
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,160
你在吗? Van Pelt探员派我过来的
You out there? Agent Van Pelt sent me.

387
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,400
你是谁?
Who are you?

388
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,500
Oscar Cordero探员 加州调查局的
Agent Oscar Cordero, CBI.

389
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,300
我来接你回去
I'm here to take you in.

390
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,860
你得保证我的安全
You gotta keep me safe.

391
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,200
他们简直无孔不入
They're everywhere.

392
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,460
没错
Yeah.

393
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,230
我们的确是无孔不入
We are.

394
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:20,360
老天...
God...

395
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,100
快到车后座去
Back of the car now.

396
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:43,330
你不会真觉得能躲过我们吧?
You didn't really think you could get away from us, did you?

397
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,560
你是个大孩子了 帮我个忙
You're a big boy. Do me a favor

398
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,660
自己钻后备箱里去
and get in the trunk yourself.

399
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,560
让我歇口气 好吗?
Just give me a second, will you?

400
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,800
你先进后备箱再说
You'll have a second in the trunk.

401
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,100
别逼我对你动手
Now don't make me do painful things to you.

402
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,760
进车里去!
Get in the car!

403
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:23,600
咱们得事先说好 完全豁免
I'm gonna need a deal. Full immunity.

404
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,100
除非能放我走 不然我一个字也不会说的
I'm not saying a word unless I can walk.

405
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,100
那你走吧
So walk.

406
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,860
什么?
What?

407
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,400
把你的肥屁股抬起来走吧
Get up off your ass and walk.

408
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,830
不过别忘了 没等你出这栋楼
But, hey, good luck getting out of the building

409
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,800
就会有老朋友去和你"叙叙旧"了
before your friends catch up with you.

410
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,860
只要你把知道的都告诉我们
If you tell us everything we need to know,

411
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:38,260
我保证把你送到远离加利福尼亚的
I promise we will put you in a Federal prison

412
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,560
联邦监狱
far away from California.

413
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,960
那样你才会安全
Someplace that you'll be safe.

414
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,400
五年前 我弄伤了背
Five years ago, I hurt my back. 

415
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,800
当时在帮我表弟搬沙发
I was helping my cousin move a stupid couch.

416
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,560
医生给我开了些止痛片
Doctor gave me some pain pills.

417
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,360
结果我对其产生了依赖
Turns out I liked them.

418
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,400
我还一头雾水的时候 就根本停不下来了
I got hooked before I even knew what was happening.

419
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,260
然后?
So?

420
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,800
然后...
So...

421
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,700
我在Carson Springs的巷子里
I'm chasing a gangbanger down an alley

422
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,130
追捕一个轮奸犯的时候 情绪失控了
in Carson Springs, and I'm out of it.

423
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:13,960
真的完全失控了
I mean, way out of it.

424
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,360
我当时... 我当时以为有人跟踪我
I thought... I thought I was being followed.

425
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,760
我开枪打死了一个小女孩
I shot a little girl.

426
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,200
一个12岁的小女孩
A 12-year-old girl.

427
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:29,860
当地警察采了我的血样
Local cops took my blood.

428
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:32,630
他们有目击证人 证据确凿
They had witnesses. They had me cold.

429
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:34,660
然后这个探长突然出现
And then this detective,

430
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,860
他过来跟我说
he reaches out to me and he says

431
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,960
他们能让这一切都烟消云散
they can make it all go away.

432
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,230
他们也确实做到了
And they did.

433
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:43,230
血样测试 目击证人... 都搞定了?
The blood tests, the witnesses... all of it?

434
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:46,460
岂止 他们搞定之后
Hell, when they got done fixing it,

435
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,960
联邦调查局还给我颁了一块勋章
the FBI gave me a medal.

436
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,960
所谓"他们"到底是谁?
And exactly who are "they"?

437
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:59,100
我们自称"布雷克组织"
We call ourselves the Blake Association.

438
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,130
为什么?
Why?

439
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:02,930
"老虎 老虎"
"Tiger, tiger."

440
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,430
"老虎 老虎 双眼绿光闪"
"Tyger, tyger burning bright."

441
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:10,130
出自布雷克的诗作
From the poem by Blake.

442
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,300
看来有人很喜欢这首诗啊
Someone's a big fan of his, I guess.

443
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,000
还有谁在这个组织里?
Well, who else is in the association?

444
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,400
警察 法官 联邦调查局探员
Cops, judges, FBI Agents.

445
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,230
任何在执法体系中有事要瞒的人
Anyone in law enforcement that needs a secret covered up.

446
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,630
比如你的毒瘾
Like your drug habit.

447
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:26,330
需要帮忙 只管张口
You need a favor, you ask for it.

448
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:28,130
找你帮忙 只管办事
You get asked to do something, you do it.

449
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:29,760
"老虎 老虎"
"Tiger, tiger."

450
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,830
没错
Yep.

451
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,630
有没有什么负责人之类的?
Well, is there somebody who's in charge?

452
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:37,630
肯定有吧
Must be.

453
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:39,060
但我不知道是谁
But I don't know who.

454
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:42,430
我就了解我周围一小圈人
I just know my little group. That's it.

455
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:45,330
但我猜
But I'm guessing

456
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,660
像我们这样的一定有上百吧 甚至上千
there must be hundreds of us, maybe thousands.

457
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,360
而且藏得滴水不漏?
And nobody knows about it?

458
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:54,030
Bob Kirkland知情了 对吧?
Bob Kirkland knew about it, didn't he?

459
00:27:56,330 --> 00:28:00,100
说吧 别压在心头了
Go ahead, just say it. Unburden yourself.

460
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:03,900
没错
Yeah.

461
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,460
他知道的太多了
He knew too much.

462
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,960
所以我杀了他
So I killed him.

463
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,460
你知不知道 红约翰是否是
Do you know that Red John's a member

464
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,030
布雷克组织的一员?
of the Blake Association?

465
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,630
你确定吗?
Are you sure?

466
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:28,760
红约翰曾经有个追随者
Red John had a follower.

467
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,660
叫Rebecca Anderson
Rebecca Anderson.

468
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:33,530
大概四年前杀了一些你们的人
Killed some of your guys about four years ago.

469
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:35,560
没错 Sam Bosco和他的团队
Yeah, Sam Bosco and his team.

470
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,660
是他们
Them.

471
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,960
有人要我搞到联邦调查局的身份证明
Someone asked me to get FBI credentials

472
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,330
从而他们能够进入加州调查局
so that they could access CBI.

473
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,930
红约翰自己或者哪个为他办事的人
Red John or someone who worked for him

474
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:50,160
偷偷溜进加州调查局给Rebecca下了毒
snuck into the CBI and poisoned Rebecca.

475
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,030
而你暗中顺水推舟?
And you helped them?

476
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,500
我是后来才知道的
I mean, that's when I knew.

477
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,730
我... 我帮了连环杀手一个忙
I'd... I'd done a favor for a serial killer.

478
00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:01,230
谁让你搞那个身份证明的?
Who asked you to get the credentials?

479
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,030
不知道 电话里说的
I don't know. It was a phone call.

480
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:05,030
组织就是这样运作的
That's the way the association works.

481
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,400
永远是黑箱
You never know.

482
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:12,900
你们...
You...

483
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,530
你们能保护我的安全的吧?
you're gonna be able to keep me safe, right?

484
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:15,860
要看情况
That depends.

485
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,100
是不是你杀了我的老婆和女儿?
Did you murder my wife and daughter?

486
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:26,400
我没杀你的老婆和女儿
I did not murder your wife and daughter.

487
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,930
我以我母亲的名誉发誓
I swear on my mother.

488
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:40,630
你相信他吗?
Do you believe him?

489
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:42,130
他对谋杀供认不讳
He confessed to murder.

490
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:44,500
红约翰是不会这样崩溃的 即使是假戏也不会真做到这个地步
Red John would never break like that, not even as an act.

491
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,400
- 既然Smith不是红约翰...  - 那就意味着我们有事情做了
- Well, if Smith isn't Red John...  - That means we have work to do.

492
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,730
我们需要帮助 谁接任了Brenda Shettrick?
And we need help. Who took over from Brenda Shettrick?

493

媒体部的? 怎么了?
In media relations? Why?

人称红约翰的连环杀手

505
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,500
加州调查局的局长

506
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,500
Gail Bertram就是红约翰

507
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,830
他是手持武器的亡命之徒

508
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:30,900
如果有人看到他 不要靠近

514
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,650

Talk about what?

515
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:06,630
Bertram是红约翰这事
Bertram is Red John.

516
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:08,660
看来是的
Looks like.

517
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,830
要是Jane找到他 就会杀了他
And if Jane finds him, he's gonna kill him.

518
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,800
没错
Yeah.

519
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,360
我们不会感觉奇怪吗? 把头儿杀了?
And we're good with that? Killing the boss?

520
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,660
我不会
I am.

521
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,900
我也不会

522
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,700
好吧
Okay.

523
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,660
幸好我们的观点一致
Just as long as we're on the same page.

524
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,360
就感觉怪怪的
It's just weird, is all.

525
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,500
Bertram吸烟吗?
Does Bertram smoke?

526
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,030
不吧
No, I don't think so.

527
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:38,160
有时候可能是礼物
People get them as gifts sometimes.

528
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,460
- Van Pelt  - 嗯?
- Van Pelt.  - Hmm?

529
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,230
嗯 原来是个闪存
Hmm. A flash drive.

530
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:55,900
咱们来看看
Let's take a look.

531
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,730
只有一个文件
There's only one file on the drive.

532
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:59,060
有密码保护的
It's password-protected.

533
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,600
我得强行打开
I'll have to brute-force it.

534
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,630
正好 我一直想试试我全新的现场可编程门阵列
Cool. I've been wanting to use my new FPGA.

535
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:04,900
你的什么?
Your what?

536
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:07,400
相信我 千万别问
Trust me, don't ask. 

537
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:12,000
然后就...
And...

538
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,530
打开了
we're in.

539
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,460
该死
Crap.

540
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,830
看起来像个清单
It looks like a list.

541
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:22,100
可能是份名单? 你能解码吗?
Names, maybe? Can you decode it?

542
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,760
我能小试一下...
I can try a few things... 

543
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,500
但解码是Jane的专长吧
but decoding is Jane's department.

544
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,830
我给他发过去
I'll send it to him.

545
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:34,660
给你 这杯可是这儿的招牌
Here you go. This one isn't messing around.

546
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,160
不加冰
Lots of peat.

547
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:43,830
嗯 不错 能放些冰块进去吗?
Yeah, that's pretty good. Can you put some rocks in it?

548
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:46,000
真要放吗? 这杯苏格兰威士忌很正的
Are you sure? This is some fine scotch.

549
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,630
让你放你就放
Yeah, I'm sure.

550
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,999
那人跟你长得真像
That guy looks like you.

551
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,300
载我一程
I need a ride.

552
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:48,430
我们正赶往酒吧
We're en route to the bar now.

553
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:50,200
高速巡警把公路封闭了
Highway patrol shut down the freeways,

554
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,660
如果他要跑 我们就能抓到他了 但要是他藏起来呢?
so if he runs, we've got him, but what if he hides?

555
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:55,030
Bertram在Citrus Heights杀了酒保
Bertram killed the bartender in Citrus Heights.

556

557
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,900
你觉得他藏在那儿了?
You think that's where he is?

558
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,200
她大概半年前搬进了退休房
She moved into a retirement home about six months ago,

559
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,500
所以她那边现在没人住
so her place is empty now.

560
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,730
听起来像是个好的藏身之处 地址呢?
Sounds like a good place to hide. What's the address?

561
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:05,760
Rosemary街1408号
1408 Rosemary Street.

562
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,860
我们正在赶来 派Cho和RRT立刻到那里去
We're on our way. Get Cho and RRT there now,

563
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,100
并且通知直升机
and let the choppers know.

564
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,230
- 他在里面吗?  - 反正要是在的话 肯定跑不了了
- Is he here?  - If he is, he's in there.

565
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,660
我让Karl和其他几个人守在后面
I got Karl and a few guys in the back.

566
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,230
- 他哪儿也别想去  - 那些人值得信任吗?
- He's not going anywhere.  - Do we trust them?

567
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:32,260
我查看了他们的肩膀和纹身
I asked to see their shoulders and their tattoos.

568
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:38,460
你们来干嘛? 我没叫萨克拉门托警察局的特警队过来
What are you doing here? I didn't call Sac P.D. S.W.A.T.

569
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,800
有人叫了
Well, someone asked for us.

570
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,700
就在这组建一个指挥中心!
Let's set up a command center right here!

571
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,960
各位听好 总负责是我!
Listen, everybody, I'm in charge!

572
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,630
谁授的权? 明明是我们先来的 他们是从北区来的
Who authorized that? We're primary on the scene. They came from northern district.

573
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:47,760
离这边远着呢 到底怎么回事?
That's way across town. What the hell is going on?

574
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,860
是他 他叫他们过来的
He did it. He called them in.

575
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:53,560
Bertram叫特警来他自己这儿干什么?
Well, why would Bertram call S.W.A.T. to his own location?

576
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,260
他不光叫了一支特警队
He didn't call in one S.W.A.T. team.

577
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,430
他把他们全都叫来了
He called all of them in.

578
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:58,900
简直乱套了
This is a madhouse.

579
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,730
后面又有个行动组莫名其妙开始组建了
There's a whole 'nother unit setting up out back.

580
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:02,060
场面要失控了 头儿
We've lost control of the scene, boss.

581
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,960
他就藏在里面 Bertram是其中之一
He's one of them. Bertram is one of them.

582
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,130
他要脱身了 咱们得控制场面
He's getting away. We gotta shut it down.

583
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,900
谁也不准离开!
Nobody leaves!

584
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,260
谁也不准离开!
No one leaves!

585
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:52,830
你安全了
You're clear.

586
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:59,100
是啊...
Yeah...

587
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,960
我得吃点东西
I need something to eat.

588
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,800
中国菜如何? 我知道一家不错的地方
How about Chinese? I know a great place.

589
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,330
好啊 听起来不错
Yeah, sounds good.

590
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,200
他们在屋里找到了Bertram的衣物
They found Bertram's clothes inside the house.

591
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,930
看来有人在他来之前就预先放了一套特警队服
Looks like someone planted a S.W.A.T. team outfit

592
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:15,600
在他房子里
in the house before he got there.

593
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,130
然后他们把附近所有的特警队和RRT叫了过去
And then called every S.W.A.T. and RRT in the area.

594
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:20,130
有没有线索是谁联系的?
Any leads about who made all those calls?

595
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:21,730
一个能够操纵多方关系的人
Somebody who could pull a lot of strings at once.

596
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:24,060
布雷克组织
Blake Association.

597
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,830
头儿
Boss.

598
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:28,160
请注意 好吗?
May I have your attention, please?

599
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,300
放下你们手里的电话 离开你们的桌椅
Put down your phones and step away from your desks.

600
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,660
快
Now.

601
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:36,030
我是这儿的负责人 Teresa Lisbon特别探员
I'm Special Agent in charge Teresa Lisbon.

602
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,360
你是谁?
Who the hell are you?

603
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,230
联邦调查局监管探员Dennis Abbott
FBI Supervisory Agent Dennis Abbott.

604
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:44,200
我重复一遍 起身
Now I repeat, stand up

605
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,530
离开你们的座椅...
and stand away from your desks...

606
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:48,830
请吧
please.

607
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:50,600
我们正忙着追捕一个
We're in the middle of a manhunt

608
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,200
亡命之徒
for a dangerous fugitive.

609
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,130
如果您想帮忙的话...
Now if you would like to assist...

610
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:57,430
这个执法机构的头儿
The head of this alleged law enforcement organization

611
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:59,330
居然是个杀人犯

612
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:02,000
还是一个大型犯罪组织的成员

613
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,060
联邦调查局探员同样混迹其中
Which included FBI Agents.

614
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:07,230
没错 这也是为什么局里从德克萨斯分局的奥斯丁
Yes, and that's why the Bureau sent me here

615
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:09,030
派我过来
from the Austin, Texas Office.

616
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:10,400
来清理门户
To clean up the mess.

617

623
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:32,600
你不能这么做
You can't do that.

624
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,130
我是来收集证据的

625
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:37,800
别不识相
Don't get in my way.

626
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,860
大家开干吧

这个嘛 由我们来担心好了

给过你机会 可是你没有把握住...
You had your chance to catch him and you blew it...

637
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,630
当然你可能根本没努力
if you were really trying.

638
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,660
这是我最喜欢的杯子
That was my favorite cup.

639

行
Yeah.

640
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,960
好吧 后会有期
Okay, well, you see in the funny pages.

641
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,800
现在怎么办?
What now?

642
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,100
不知道

Van Pelt在Bertram办公室里找到了一些加密文档
Van Pelt found some coded files in Bertram's office.

644
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,960
我们应该着手去查吗?

645
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,700
不 都是浪费时间 我们没戏了

646
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,460
没什么好做的了
There's nothing more to do here.

647
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:03,360
回家吧 休息休息
Just go home, get some rest.

648
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,500
我不相信 你不可能就这么放弃的
You're not quitting. I don't believe it.

649
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:08,860
不 我没放弃
No, I'm not quitting.

650

我只是放手了
I'm letting go.

652
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:17,000
事情已经不归我们管了
It's out of our hands for now.

653
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,360
我会和你联系的 好吗?
