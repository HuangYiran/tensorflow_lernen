1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,790
星际之门之亚特兰蒂斯 前情提要
Previously on Stargate Atlantis...

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:07,790
母船在49小时之后就会进入
卫星的攻击范围
The hive ships will be in range
of the satellite in 49 hours.

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:10,990
那个卫星是唯一可以在幽灵和亚特兰蒂斯之间
起抵抗作用的东西了
That satellite is the only thing
standing between the Wraith and Atlantis.

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,290
你的意思是, 你认为它还不够强大
足以干掉一艘幽灵的母船
And you think it's powerful enough
to take out a Wraith hive ship?

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,290
根据古人的数据库, 当完全充满电时
它应该能够干掉所有这三艘母船
According to the Ancients' database, it should
be able to take out all three when fully charged.

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,990
很糟糕, 非常糟糕
This is bad. Very bad.

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:19,990
我不知道我能不能修好它
I'm not sure I can fix this.

8
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,490
幽灵的兴趣
并不在于摧毁亚特兰蒂斯
The Wraith are not interested
in destroying Atlantis.

9
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:24,990
它们到这里来是为了去地球
They're coming here to get to Earth.

10
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:25,890
这就意味着要劫持这座城市
Which means stealing the city, which
is why we have a self-destruct in place.

11
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:28,290
这也就是为什么
我们要在这里装上自毁装置
We're having trouble
docking with the satellite.

12
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:30,990
我们没法停靠到卫星上
See what you can do from your side.

13
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:31,990
没时间了
There isn't time for that.

14
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:37,990
飞到安全距离之外 再回来接我
然后在卫星教训完幽灵的飞船之后
Get to a safe distance, then come get me once
the satellite has taken care of the Wraith ships.

15
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:41,190
我们干掉一艘了!
We have a kill.

16
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:44,590
没有时间了
快点离开这里!
There's no time. Just get the hell out of here!

17
00:00:47,346 --> 00:00:49,990
亚特兰蒂斯, 我是McKay!
我们已经失去了卫星!
Atlantis, this is McKay. We have lost the satellite.

18
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:54,090
- 你们有没有打下更多的飞船?
- 没有, 另外两艘飞船都完好无损
Did you manage to take out any more ships? Negative. The two other hive ships are intact.

19
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,090
你在那儿也做不了什么了, Rodney
返回亚特兰蒂斯吧
You can't do any more out there, Rodney. Return to Atlantis.

20
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:07,390
欢迎回来, Rodney
Welcome back, Rodney.

21
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:08,390
现在是什么情况?
Where are we?

22
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:10,890
探测器显示, 母船又开始移动了
Our scanners show the hive
ships have started moving again,

23
00:01:10,891 --> 00:01:12,890
虽然移动的速度非常慢
although their pace
has slowed considerably.

24
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,290
很显然, 你的行动得让它们考虑考虑
Obviously, you gave them
something to think about.

25
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:17,690
不管它们是两小时后到达
还是两天后到达
If they get here in two hours or two days,

26
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:19,890
这并不能改变
我们已经束手无策的现实
it
doesn't change the fact that we're out of options.

27
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:22,490
我们不能指望跟它们战斗
We can't hope to fight them.

28
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:24,490
因此希望你们两个能够有更好的主意
So, unless either of you has any more ideas...

29
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:31,990
最后一组人已经准备好撤离了
The last group is assembled and ready for evac.

30
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:34,990
很好
All right, then.

31
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:36,790
我们把这件事做完吧
Let's get this done. Ready?

32
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:02,890
自毁程序已经启动了
准备将病毒加载到古人的主机中
Self-destruct is armed. Prepare to load the virus into the Ancient mainframe.

33
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:05,890
Rodney, 拨通阿尔法站点
Rodney, dial the alpha site.

34
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:08,890
就开始拨
Dialing.

35
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,590
有虫洞连接进来
We've got an incoming wormhole.

36
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,190
接收身份验证码...
We're receiving an I.D.C.

37
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,190
是谁?
Who is it?

38
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:30,190
星际之门指挥官
Stargate Command.

39
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:33,190
- 你确定?
- 肯定
Are you sure? Positive.

40
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,190
解除防护盾
Lower the shields.

41
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,590
Weir博士?
Dr. Weir?

42
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:53,790
是的
Yes.

43
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,590
Dillard Everett上校, 美国海军陆战队
Colonel Everett, United States Marine Corps.

44
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,690
你应该知道...
You should know...

45
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:01,290
O'Neill将军恭贺你们, 任务完成得很好
即便是在这种极端的环境下
General O'Neill sends his compliments on a job
well done under extraordinary circumstances.

46
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,050
你的任务完成了
You are relieved.

47
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,050
长官, 我们正准备撤退
We were about to evacuate.

48
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,050
- 不进行战斗?
- 是的
Without a fight. Yes, sir.

49
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,800
这是我的命令
On my order.

50
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,300
撤销撤退命令
That evacuation order is rescinded.

51
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,300
我想你们已经启动了自毁装置
I assume you've armed the self-destruct device?

52
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,200
是的, 因为Weir是想告诉你...
Yes, sir, we have, but as
Dr. Weir was trying to tell you...

53
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,400
我要你立刻解除它
I am going to need you to disarm it immediately.

54
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,400
等等, 上校
我想你并没有完全了解这里的形势
Hold on a second, Colonel. I don't think you fully grasp our situation...

55
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,400
有三艘幽灵的飞船
正向你们这个方向飞来
You have three Wraith hive ships
bearing down on your position

56
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,500
而你们没有什么可以自卫
and precious little to defend yourselves with.

57
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,500
是这些么?
That about sum it up?

58
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,500
你收到了我们的消息?
You got our message.

59
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,500
我们收到了消息
We got your message.

60
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,500
现在已经减少到两艘母船了
我们成功的摧毁了一艘
It's down to two hive ships.
We managed to destroy one.

61
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,500
这更好
这样我的工作就更轻松了
Good for you. That should make my job a little easier.

62
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,400
你的工作具体是什么, 长官?
What exactly is your job, sir?

63
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:45,300
我想那对你来说应该很清楚, 少校
我们应该不惜一切代价保卫亚特兰蒂斯
I should think that would be We are going to defend Atlantis at all costs.
obvious to you by now, Major.

64
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
星际之门之亚特兰蒂斯
第一季第20集 围攻 第二部分
Season 1 : Episode 20
The siege (part 2)

65
00:04:51,337 --> 00:04:51,837
上校
Colonel.

66
00:04:53,137 --> 00:04:54,837
这是O'Neill签署的
Signed by General O'Neill.

67
00:05:00,837 --> 00:05:03,037
上校, 我们并不是不感激
Colonel, it's not that we don't appreciate the thought,

68
00:05:03,337 --> 00:05:06,437
不过如果你读过那份介绍
舰队正朝这里开来的报告
but if you had read the report
on the armada headed this way,

69
00:05:06,437 --> 00:05:07,437
我们没有什么可以做了
you'd know there's not much we can do about it.

70
00:05:07,437 --> 00:05:10,437
是的, 我 一页一页的读过你们的报告
Oh, I read your report cover to cover, Major.

71
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,800
你们一定是找到了一个ZPM
They must have found a ZPM.

72
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,100
只有这样你们才能从地球拨号到这里
That's the only way they could
have dialed in from Earth.

73
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,500
它是被一队考古学家在埃及发现的
It was discovered in Egypt
by a group of archaeologists.

74
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,000
这个该死的东西一直都藏在我们眼皮底下
The damn thing has been under our noses the whole time.

75
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
难以想象！
Fantastic. Wait a minute.

76
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,500
等等, 你们怎样才能把那个ZPM带到这里来?
你们需要它建立虫洞
How could you possibly bring the ZPM back here? You need it to maintain the wormhole.

77
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,800
在我们说话的时候, 它已经被传送到了
Daedalus号上了, 我们的新战舰
As we speak, it is being transported up
to the Daedalus, our new battlecruiser.

78
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,800
Prometheus号的姊妹舰
我简直无法想象它已经造好了
Sister ship of the Prometheus. I didn't even know it was finished.

79
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:36,200
利用那个ZPM的能量
她将会在四天内到达这里
With the ZPM boosting her engines, she
should be here inside of of four days.

80
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,200
在这段时间内我们要守住这个基地
That is how long we have to hold this base.

81
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,200
Sheppard少校
拨通那个飞马座的阿尔法站点
Major Sheppard, dial Pegasus alpha
site, recall all military personnel.

82
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:46,200
叫所有的军事人员, 连同所有
愿意回来帮忙的平民, 马上回来
As well, any civilians who would like to return and
help take part in damage control are welcome to do so.

83
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,200
我们非常欢迎他们
And when you're done with that,

84
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,200
在你做完之后
到我设在会议室中的办公室中来
please join
me and my officers in the conference room.

85
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,200
我们将讨论一下我们的战术安排
We'll discuss our tactical position.

86
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,200
Everett上校?
Colonel Everett.

87
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,200
好吧, 现在你是主管
Fine, you're in charge,

88
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,200
不过有需要我的地方
可以去那个简报厅找我
but
I should be at that briefing.

89
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,200
如果涉及到亚特兰蒂斯的其它方面时
我很乐意让你加入
When it comes down to any other aspect of
Atlantis, I will be happy to include you.

90
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,200
我们是在谈我们的战术安排
We're talking about our tactical position.

91
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,200
- 我明白...
- 很好!
- I understand that...
- Good.

92
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,200
能不能有个人去把自毁装置关掉?
Somebody want to please turn off that self-destruct?

93
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,100
这幅示意图是跟据你们发给我们的信息画的
它准确么?
This schematic is based on the Can I assume it's accurate?
information we got in your message.

94
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,100
是的, 长官!
Yes, sir.

95
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,300
- 上尉, 实施方案, 阿尔法2
- 是的, 长官!
Captain, deploy plan alpha-two. Yes, sir.

96
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,800
军士, 阿尔法2
Sergeant, alpha-two.

97
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,800
如果你不介意的话, 我想问一下, 上校
实施什么方案?
If you don't mind my asking,
Colonel, deploy what exactly?

98
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,300
我们带来了一些轨迹枪
We brought along a few rail guns.

99
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,300
它们本来是为Prometheus准备的
They were originally slated  for Prometheus

100
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,300
在他们下一次更换装备的时候
替换他们现有的装备
to replace
their current close-in armament on her next refit.

101
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,900
它们可以在250英里的距离上
产生速度为5马赫速度的冲击力
They will deliver an impact
velocity of mach 5 at 250 miles.

102
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,900
一个标准的弹夹就支持发射一万次
A standard magazine
will hold 10,000 rounds.

103
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,800
自毁已经被中止了
The self-destruct has been aborted.

104
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,200
谢谢! 你联系了阿尔法站点么?
Thank you. Did you contact the alpha site?

105
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,400
是我让Sheppard先不忙
I asked major Sheppard to wait

106
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,300
直到我有机会跟你谈谈
until I had a chance to talk with you.

107
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,300
- 是么?
- 是的
- Is that a fact?
- Yes, sir.

108
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,300
少校? 拨通阿尔法站点!
Major, dial the alpha site.

109
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,700
上校, 你到这里一共只有五分钟
Colonel, you've been here all of five minutes.

110
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,700
而到现在为止
我已经为基地中的所有人
Now, I have been responsible for
the lives of the people on this base,

111
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,700
包括军人和平民
both military and civilian,

112
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,700
负责了几个月了
for the past several months.

113
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,300
我不想把这些人的生命置于危险境地
直到我知道你将准备如何保卫这个城市
I'm not about to put those lives in jeopardy until
I at least know how you intend to defend this city.

114
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,300
我不需要向你解释, 博士
而且我也不需要你的合作
I don't need to explain myself to you,
Doctor, and I don't need your cooperation.

115
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,137
不过你可能需要我...长官
But you could probably use mine. Sir.

116
00:07:16,137 --> 00:07:20,137
所以, 不是有意冒犯
请回答Weir博士的问题
So with all due respect, please
answer Dr. Weir's question.

117
00:07:20,737 --> 00:07:22,737
- 你这不是在威胁我吧, 少校?
- 不, 长官.
Is that a threat, Major? No, sir.

118
00:07:22,937 --> 00:07:25,737
我知道你需要建立一条清晰的指令链
I understand you need to establish a clear chain
of command,

119
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:27,837
不过如果你把Weir博士排除在外
but if you cut Dr. Weir out of the loop,

120
00:07:28,137 --> 00:07:30,837
你将只会疏远信赖和尊敬她的人
you'll only alienate the people whose
trust and respect she's earned,
which is everyone on the base, including me.

121
00:07:31,337 --> 00:07:34,637
也就是说基地中的所有人, 包括我
Is that a fact?

122
00:07:42,737 --> 00:07:43,337
请坐吧
Have a seat.

123
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:51,837
我应该参加那个会议
I should be in that meeting.

124
00:07:52,637 --> 00:07:54,837
我是了解这个城市防御能力的首席专家
I am the foremost expert on the
defense capabilities of this city.

125
00:07:55,337 --> 00:07:58,337
是的, 你知道
当军方参与进来之后, 科学家就只能坐在旁边
You know how it is. When military steps in,
 scientists take a back seat.

126
00:07:58,337 --> 00:08:00,337
直到他们需要我们
Until they need us.

127
00:08:00,337 --> 00:08:01,337
- 他们认为他们不需要我们
- 是的, 他们认为不需要我们
They don't think they need us. They don't think they need us right
up

128
00:08:01,337 --> 00:08:04,337
一直到他们需要我们的时刻
然后他们又需要我们
until the point that they need us.
- And then... they need us.

129
00:08:04,337 --> 00:08:06,337
他们需要我们
- Then they need us.

130
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:07,337
看看这个
Take a look at this.

131
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,537
六个naquadah增强型的核弹头
Six naquadah-enhanced nuclear
warheads,

132
00:08:17,537 --> 00:08:19,137
每颗120亿吨的当量
1,200 megatons a piece.

133
00:08:19,137 --> 00:08:22,737
它们是几乎所有地雷工程师的结晶
雷达是完全探测不到的
They emit almost zero E.M. and
are otherwise invisible to radar.

134
00:08:22,737 --> 00:08:25,737
一旦被部署, 它们将会被近炸引信引爆
Once deployed, they will
detonate by proximity fuse.

135
00:08:26,937 --> 00:08:27,937
太空地雷?
Space mines?

136
00:08:27,937 --> 00:08:29,937
是的. 我们可以利用隐身的小飞船
That's right.

137
00:08:29,937 --> 00:08:32,537
把它们放置在舰队和亚特兰蒂斯之间
We'll use jumpers in stealth mode to place them
in a pattern between the armada and Atlantis.

138
00:08:32,537 --> 00:08:35,037
少校, 我们希望
你可以帮助我们完成这个
Major, we were hoping you could help us with that.

139
00:08:35,037 --> 00:08:37,637
好的, 不过我建议留下两个备用
Yes, but I recommend keeping a couple in reserve.

140
00:08:37,637 --> 00:08:39,637
不行, 我们准备一次就搞定
Negative. We'll only get one shot at this.

141
00:08:40,037 --> 00:08:41,537
我们必须考虑到这种可能性...
We'll have to consider the possibility...

142
00:08:41,537 --> 00:08:42,437
我的人中有四个是飞行员
Four of my men are pilots.

143
00:08:42,637 --> 00:08:45,137
Beckett正在对他们进行基因植入
Beckett is giving them the gene inoculation right now.

144
00:08:45,665 --> 00:08:48,365
在这完成之后, 你要带他们去熟悉飞船
Assuming it takes, you will
familiarize them with the jumpers,

145
00:08:48,365 --> 00:08:50,365
他们将会成为我们的战斗机掩护分队
and they will become our fighter screen.

146
00:08:50,365 --> 00:08:51,365
同我一起
Along with me.

147
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:52,365
我有另外一个任务给你
I have another job for you.

148
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,365
我知道这个基地装备有一个
座椅武器平台
I understand that this base is
equipped with a chair weapons platform,

149
00:08:55,365 --> 00:08:58,365
类似于我们在南极洲找到的那个
like the one we found in Antarctica.

150
00:08:58,765 --> 00:09:00,765
是的, 不过我们没办法为它提供足够的能量
Yes, but we have no way of powering it. We do now.

151
00:09:00,765 --> 00:09:03,765
我们知道, 我们带来了一个
二号型号的naquadah发电机
We brought a mark II naquadah generator.

152
00:09:05,065 --> 00:09:07,665
我们找到办法可以将
能量输出提高6倍
We found a way to increase
the power output by 600%.

153
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:09,165
这不是永久的
It won't last nearly as long,

154
00:09:09,165 --> 00:09:11,365
不过应该可以在我们需要的时候
为椅子提供足够长时间的能量
but it should
power the chair for as long as we need it to.

155
00:09:11,365 --> 00:09:12,765
这听起来像是一个筹划已久的计划
This is beginning to sound like a plan.

156
00:09:16,165 --> 00:09:17,865
我们知道这是一个艰巨的任务
We know this is a long shot,

157
00:09:17,865 --> 00:09:18,865
不过正如我所说
but like I said,

158
00:09:18,865 --> 00:09:21,865
我们所需要做的就是坚持住
直到Daedalus到达这里
all we
have to do is hold out until the Daedalus gets here,

159
00:09:21,865 --> 00:09:23,865
然后我们就可以用ZPM
来启动城市的防护罩
then we can use the ZPM to power the city shield.

160
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:26,865
还有什么问题么?
Any questions?

161
00:09:32,765 --> 00:09:33,765
好吧
All right, then.

162
00:09:33,765 --> 00:09:36,765
现在Weir博士已经被告知了所有的计划
Now that Dr. Weir has been informed of
our plans, I would greatly appreciate it

163
00:09:36,765 --> 00:09:39,765
如果你们执行我的命令
联系阿尔法站点
if you'd execute my order

164
00:09:39,765 --> 00:09:42,765
我将会非常感谢
 and contact the alpha site.

165
00:09:44,765 --> 00:09:45,465
遵命, 长官
Yes, sir.

166
00:09:49,765 --> 00:09:50,665
还有, 少校!
And Major.

167
00:09:52,765 --> 00:09:54,865
这是我最后一次向你重复我的命令
This is last time I give you an order twice.

168
00:09:57,265 --> 00:09:58,265
明白
Understood.

169
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,865
你一定是Teyla了
You must be Teyla.

170
00:11:52,165 --> 00:11:53,465
你一定是Everett上校
And you are Colonel Everett.

171
00:11:53,865 --> 00:11:56,465
Sheppard少校在他的报告中
对你的评价很高
Major Sheppard spoke very highly of you in his report.

172
00:11:57,165 --> 00:12:00,265
当然, 最近的报告让我有一点关注
Of course, a more recent report
has me a little concerned.

173
00:12:00,865 --> 00:12:03,265
你认为我可以再一次陷入
幽灵的影响之中么?
You think I may once again fall
under the influence of the Wraith?

174
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:09,265
Sheppard少校向我保证, 这不会再发生了
不过我要你不要参和进来
Major Sheppard assures me that won't happen,
but I do need you to stay out of the way.

175
00:12:09,865 --> 00:12:12,265
你不是需要每个有能力的人
来保护亚特兰蒂斯么?
Do you not need every able
body to help defend Atlantis?

176
00:12:13,736 --> 00:12:15,265
我认为我们就可以应付
I think we can handle it.

177
00:12:21,465 --> 00:12:22,765
他根本就没有试
He's not even trying.

178
00:12:22,765 --> 00:12:24,765
我们已经试了几十次了
We've tried this a dozen times.

179
00:12:24,765 --> 00:12:25,965
当时不是用的这个能源
But never with this power source.

180
00:12:25,965 --> 00:12:27,765
我是认真的! Sheppard少校是你要找的人
I'm serious. Major Sheppard's your man.

181
00:12:27,765 --> 00:12:30,765
他当然是, 不过他在训练飞行员
而现在正在部署太空地雷
Of course he is, but he's training pilots
and deploying space mines right now,

182
00:12:30,765 --> 00:12:32,465
所以我们就要缠住你
so we're stuck with you.

183
00:12:32,465 --> 00:12:34,465
现在, 仔细听我说
Now, listen to me very carefully,
do exactly what I tell you to do,

184
00:12:34,465 --> 00:12:36,465
完全按照我所说的去做
希望没有人会受伤
and hopefully no one will get hurt.

185
00:12:36,765 --> 00:12:38,865
Rodney, 一定还有其他人
Rodney, there must be someone else.

186
00:12:38,865 --> 00:12:40,865
集中精力, 想着让椅子启动
Concentrate on powering up the chair.

187
00:12:40,865 --> 00:12:42,865
排除其他一切杂念
Nothing else, nothing more, nothing but.

188
00:12:42,865 --> 00:12:43,865
不要想着...
Don't start thinking...

189
00:12:43,865 --> 00:12:46,865
不要跟我说那些, 不要开始想
或者我会开始想它!
don't tell me what not to start thinking
about, or I'll start thinking about it.

190
00:12:46,865 --> 00:12:47,865
请把它启动
Please power it up.

191
00:12:52,865 --> 00:12:57,065
好, 好, 好
Good. Good... good.

192
00:12:59,465 --> 00:13:00,265
噢, 不
And... oh, no.

193
00:13:01,065 --> 00:13:02,265
什么? 我做错什么了?
What? Did I do something wrong?

194
00:13:08,265 --> 00:13:10,465
完了吧? 没什么可担心的
So... see? Nothing to worry about.

195
00:13:12,565 --> 00:13:13,665
让他从椅子上下来
Get him out of the chair.

196
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:21,865
Elizabeth!
Elizabeth.

197
00:13:21,865 --> 00:13:25,865
抱歉, 我已经接上了那个发电机
而且座椅平台也可以工作了
 Excuse me. I've hooked up the generator, and
 the chair platform is operational.

198
00:13:25,865 --> 00:13:26,965
这是个好消息!
That's good news.

199
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:28,265
并不完全是
Not so much.

200
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:29,265
为什么, 有什么问题?
Why? What's wrong?

201
00:13:29,465 --> 00:13:31,265
椅子只有为数不多的飞弹了
We're down to just a few dozen drones.

202
00:13:31,265 --> 00:13:32,865
你直到现在才发现这个?
And you're just finding this out now?

203
00:13:32,865 --> 00:13:35,865
在椅子初始化之前, 没有办法知道这个
There was no way of determining
that until the chair was initialized,

204
00:13:35,865 --> 00:13:37,865
所以只有在二号发电机接上后
我才有可能发现
and that was only possible
once the mark II was tied in.

205
00:13:37,865 --> 00:13:40,665
在南极洲的椅子控制了
成千上万个这种该死的东西
The chair in Antarctica controlled
thousands of the damn things.

206
00:13:40,665 --> 00:13:42,165
是的, 我知道!
Yes. I know.

207
00:13:42,165 --> 00:13:45,565
它们可能在古人第一次防御幽灵进攻
的时候被用掉了
They were probably used defending Atlantis the
first time the Wraith attacked the Ancients.

208
00:13:45,565 --> 00:13:48,865
即使只有几十个也能帮我们
防守一会儿航空港
Even a few dozen will help us
keep them at bay for a while.

209
00:13:49,865 --> 00:13:50,865
怎么了?
What is it?

210
00:13:51,365 --> 00:13:53,365
有入侵者
我不知道他们来自哪里
We have incoming. I don't know where they came from.

211
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:54,365
它们是突然出现的
They just appeared all of a sudden.

212
00:13:54,865 --> 00:13:55,865
怎么了?
What's going on?

213
00:13:56,165 --> 00:13:58,865
我们刚刚探测到有一波目标
正在接近我们星球
We've just detected a wave of
objects approaching the planet.

214
00:13:58,865 --> 00:13:59,865
有多少?
How many?

215
00:13:59,865 --> 00:14:00,865
几百个
A hundred plus.

216
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:03,465
它们为什么没有被远程探测器检测到?
How come they weren't detected
by the long-range sensors?

217
00:14:04,865 --> 00:14:05,865
因为它们是石头!
Because they're rocks...

218
00:14:06,465 --> 00:14:07,465
小行星!
asteroids.

219
00:14:07,465 --> 00:14:10,465
幽灵一定是从小行星带捕获它们
The Wraith must have harvested them
from this system's asteroid belt

220
00:14:10,465 --> 00:14:12,065
然后在安全的距离之外
将它们加速抛向我们
and accelerated them towards
us from a safe distance.

221
00:14:12,065 --> 00:14:14,365
主机花了很长时间才判断出
它们是一个威胁
The mainframe's taken this long
to determine they were a threat.

222
00:14:14,365 --> 00:14:15,665
它们可以造成很大的破坏么?
Can they do much damage?

223
00:14:15,665 --> 00:14:17,865
大部分会在大气层中烧掉
Oh, yeah, even if most of them
burn off in the atmosphere,

224
00:14:17,865 --> 00:14:19,165
不过这肯定不是它们的目的
but that's not why they're doing it.

225
00:14:19,165 --> 00:14:21,165
它们正冲着地雷而去
They're headed toward the mines.

226
00:14:21,165 --> 00:14:23,165
它们可以被关掉么?
Well, can they be deactivated?

227
00:14:23,165 --> 00:14:25,165
不行!
No.

228
00:14:38,265 --> 00:14:39,265
好了
Well...

229
00:14:39,265 --> 00:14:41,065
这下好了
that's that.

230
00:14:41,265 --> 00:14:43,265
你的地雷炸得可真响啊, 上校
Your mines made one hell of a bang, Colonel.

231
00:14:43,265 --> 00:14:45,265
我相信幽灵的耳朵还在嗡嗡响呢
I'm sure the Wraiths' ears are ringing.

232
00:14:46,165 --> 00:14:47,765
怎么看不见母船的状态了?
What's the status of the hive ships?

233
00:14:47,965 --> 00:14:49,165
没办法知道了
There's no way of knowing.

234
00:14:49,165 --> 00:14:51,165
地雷的爆炸一定是让探测器过载了
The mine detonations must
have overloaded the sensors.

235
00:14:51,165 --> 00:14:52,565
后备探测器要多久才能工作?
How long till they're back up?

236
00:14:53,565 --> 00:14:55,565
那里有太多的残余辐射了
There's a lot of residual radiation.

237
00:14:56,165 --> 00:14:57,465
我们在几小时之内将什么都看不到
It'll keep us blind for hours.

238
00:14:57,465 --> 00:15:01,465
是的, 它们还在那里
而且我们刚刚失去了我们的首要防线
Yeah, well, they're still out there, and
we just lost our primary line of defense.

239
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:16,465
你想见我, 上校?
You wanted to see me, Colonel?

240
00:15:16,765 --> 00:15:20,165
我被告知可以在这个房间里
学到很多亚特兰蒂斯的历史
I was told I could learn a lot about
the history of Atlantis in this room.

241
00:15:20,165 --> 00:15:23,165
我们并没有怎么用它
因为它的能量需求太高了
We haven't used it much because
of the power requirements.

242
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:25,465
不过, 我还是想亲自看看
Still, I would like to see for myself

243
00:15:25,465 --> 00:15:27,065
古人第一次是怎么失败的
how the Ancients lost the first time,

244
00:15:27,065 --> 00:15:29,465
这样可以尽量避免它们所犯的的错误
try to avoid their mistakes.

245
00:15:30,565 --> 00:15:32,465
是的, 长官
我们可以做到
Yes, sir, we could do that.

246
00:15:42,065 --> 00:15:44,765
这是飞马星系的状态
This is the status of the Pegasus galaxy

247
00:15:44,765 --> 00:15:47,765
在古人遭遇到幽灵之前
before the Ancients encountered the Wraith.

248
00:15:48,965 --> 00:15:54,665
蓝色的代表有古人居住
或者受到古人保护的星球
The blue stars represent systems either
inhabited by or protected by the Ancients.

249
00:15:54,665 --> 00:15:57,665
然后...
Then...

250
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:01,865
这是他们战斗了大概一百年后的样子
this is how it looked after
they fought for almost a hundred years.

251
00:16:03,165 --> 00:16:04,865
所有这些当中, 只剩下亚特兰蒂斯了
Until Atlantis was all that was left?

252
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:05,865
是的
Yes, sir.

253
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:08,365
这就是围攻开始的时候
That's when the siege began.

254
00:16:11,365 --> 00:16:14,365
在接下来的几年中
亚特兰蒂斯还可以抵御入侵者
For several more years, the Atlantians
were able to hold off their attackers,

255
00:16:14,365 --> 00:16:17,365
依靠城市的防护罩和更先进的武器系统
relying on the city's shield and superior weaponry,

256
00:16:17,365 --> 00:16:19,865
包括卫星武器系统
including the weapons satellite system.

257
00:16:19,865 --> 00:16:23,865
但是不管摧毁了多少艘幽灵的飞船
总是会有更多的飞船不停地赶来
No matter how many Wraith ships They could win almost every battle,

258
00:16:23,865 --> 00:16:26,865
它们可以打赢每一场战斗
but they saw no way to win the war.  they destroyed, more kept coming here.

259
00:16:26,865 --> 00:16:33,865
但是他们发觉无法赢得这场战争 于是, 他们沉下城市然后离开了


So... they submerged the city... and left.

260
00:16:37,865 --> 00:16:38,865
就这些?
That's it.

261
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:40,865
这是传说
 That's the story.

262
00:16:40,965 --> 00:16:42,965
不过图景非常清楚
But the picture is pretty clear.

263
00:16:42,965 --> 00:16:45,465
所以你认为这是一场打不赢的战争
So you think this is a no-win situation?

264
00:16:45,465 --> 00:16:47,865
不, 长官
我的意思是
No, sir. What I mean is,

265
00:16:49,365 --> 00:16:50,865
即便是我们在这一次打败了它们
它们还是会回来
even if we beat
them this time, they're going to come back.

266
00:16:55,965 --> 00:16:56,965
少校
Major...

267
00:16:58,565 --> 00:16:59,565
我想我可以告诉你
I think I should tell you

268
00:16:59,565 --> 00:17:02,565
Marshal Sumner上校
是我的一个非常要好的朋友
that colonel
Marshall Sumner was a very good friend of mine.

269
00:17:02,565 --> 00:17:03,965
我们一起共事多年
We served together a lot of years and

270
00:17:03,965 --> 00:17:05,965
你知道...
you know...

271
00:17:05,965 --> 00:17:07,965
我不能只为自己活着
I cannot, for the life of me,

272
00:17:07,965 --> 00:17:10,965
很想知道为什么你已经走了那么远
却仍然没有救他
figure how it is that you could go
as far as you did and not save him.

273
00:17:10,965 --> 00:17:12,965
你怎么能够离得那么近却...
- How you could get that close...

274
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:14,465
在我找到Sumner上校的时候...
- By the time I reached colonel Sumner...

275
00:17:14,465 --> 00:17:17,465
更糟! 你向他开枪杀了他
worse, you admit to firing
the shot that killed him.

276
00:17:17,465 --> 00:17:20,465
因为我相信这是他要我做的
Because I believe that's
what he wanted me to do.

277
00:17:22,965 --> 00:17:24,165
你很了解他, 是么?
You knew him that well, did you?

278
00:17:25,965 --> 00:17:27,165
你当时不在那里, 长官
You weren't there, sir.

279
00:17:32,765 --> 00:17:34,765
我喜欢是为他好
I wish, for his sake, I was.

280
00:17:40,865 --> 00:17:43,465
那晚的情景总在我脑中挥之不去
There isn't a night that doesn't go by
where

281
00:17:43,865 --> 00:17:46,465
当时的情景总在我眼前重演
that moment doesn't play in my head...

282
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:49,365
每当那个时候...
and every time it does...

283
00:17:49,365 --> 00:17:51,865
控制室
Control room...

284
00:17:51,865 --> 00:17:53,865
我是Everett上校, 请回话
This is colonel Everett. Report.

285
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:55,865
长官, 我们刚刚探测到
一波梭镖飞船入侵
Sir, we've just detected a wave of darts inbound.

286
00:17:57,365 --> 00:17:58,865
我就来
到椅子那儿去
I'm on my way. Head to the chair.

287
00:17:59,465 --> 00:18:01,765
这事我们以后再说
We'll finish this later.

288
00:18:05,065 --> 00:18:06,065
发生什么了?
What's happening?

289
00:18:06,065 --> 00:18:08,065
很多个信号, 长官
正在飞快地接近中
Multiple signals, sir, closing fast.

290
00:18:08,065 --> 00:18:10,865
McKay说得没错
核爆炸损坏了探测器
Dr. McKay must've been right about
the nukes damaging the sensors.

291
00:18:10,865 --> 00:18:12,865
直到它们飞到我们头顶上时
我们才发现
We couldn't see them until
they were right on top of us.

292
00:18:12,865 --> 00:18:13,865
射击手就位了么?
Are my gunners in position?

293
00:18:13,865 --> 00:18:14,865
是的, 长官
Yes, sir.

294
00:18:14,865 --> 00:18:16,265
损害控制分队呢?
About our damage control parties?

295
00:18:16,265 --> 00:18:17,265
他们都已经就位了
They're all in position.

296
00:18:17,265 --> 00:18:20,265
很好, 关闭城市的灯光
All right. Darken the city.

297
00:18:32,865 --> 00:18:34,465
记住! 短, 稳, 快
Remember, short steady bursts.

298
00:18:43,365 --> 00:18:44,765
它们来了
Here they come!

299
00:19:32,465 --> 00:19:32,965
McKay, 把它开动起来
McKay, fire it up!

300
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:34,465
要等一分钟
It'll take a minute.

301
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:36,365
我们一分钟也不能耽误了!
We don't have a minute.

302
00:19:36,365 --> 00:19:38,065
这个发电机只有在工作于一个
近似过载的边缘状态时
This generator can only power the chair

303
00:19:38,065 --> 00:19:40,465
才能为椅子提供能量
because it
operates in a state of barely-controlled overload...

304
00:19:41,265 --> 00:19:42,465
快点让这个该死的东西工作起来!
Just get the damn thing working.

305
00:19:42,465 --> 00:19:45,465
这正是我在努力去做的
That's what I'm trying to do.

306
00:19:49,965 --> 00:19:50,665
上校, 我是Radnor!
Colonel, it's Radner.

307
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:53,065
说吧
Go ahead.

308
00:19:53,065 --> 00:19:56,065
看起来它们当中有一些
开始进行神风敢死队似的攻击
<i>It looks like some of them are</i>
<i>starting to make kamikaze runs.</i>

309
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:01,465
发生什么了?
What happened?

310
00:20:02,765 --> 00:20:04,465
我们失去了主要系统
We lost primary systems.

311
00:20:34,765 --> 00:20:35,665
有一个射击点停了
One of our gun positions is dark.

312
00:20:37,265 --> 00:20:38,665
Farrell, 你怎么不射击了?
Ferrell, why aren't you firing?

313
00:20:42,465 --> 00:20:43,465
Farrell, 回答!
Ferrell, report.

314
00:20:44,665 --> 00:20:48,865
上校, 我是Ford中尉
我离Farrell的位置比较近, 我就过去!
Colonel, this is lieutenant Ford. I'm near Ferrell's position. I'm on it!

315
00:20:53,265 --> 00:20:54,265
好了你有能量了, 干吧!
You've got power. Go!

316
00:22:33,265 --> 00:22:35,265
城市的探测器没有能量供应了
Power is out in sections of the city.

317
00:22:35,265 --> 00:22:38,265
远程探测器和内部探测器都不工作了
不过我们正在着手解决
The long-range scanners and the internal
sensors are down, but we're working on them.

318
00:22:38,265 --> 00:22:40,065
我想知道那些母船的状态
I want to know the status of those hive ships A.S.A.P.

319
00:22:40,065 --> 00:22:42,365
它们正在靠近, 这就是它们的状态!
They're coming. That's their status.

320
00:22:42,365 --> 00:22:44,765
明天, 后天, 大后天!
Tomorrow, the day after, the day after that...

321
00:22:44,765 --> 00:22:45,765
最终, 它们会到这里的
 eventually, they'll get here.

322
00:22:45,765 --> 00:22:47,765
我们是不是在这里欢迎它们
就是另外一回事了
Whether we're here to greet
them or not is another matter.

323
00:22:47,765 --> 00:22:48,765
Rodney
Rodney.

324
00:22:48,765 --> 00:22:51,465
听者, 那个椅子已经用完弹药了
你准备怎样应付下一波?
Look, the chair is out of drones. How do you expect to handle the next wave?

325
00:22:51,465 --> 00:22:53,465
我接受大家的意见
I'm open to suggestions.

326
00:22:53,465 --> 00:22:54,465
真的么?
Really?

327
00:22:57,765 --> 00:22:58,765
我们去攻击母船
We target the hive ships.

328
00:22:59,165 --> 00:23:00,165
用什么?
With what?

329
00:23:00,365 --> 00:23:02,965
我们驾驶处于隐形状态的小飞船
直取它们的咽喉
We fly the puddle jumper in stealth
mode right down their throats.

330
00:23:03,018 --> 00:23:04,518
你是准备完成一项自杀任务?
Are you volunteering for a suicide mission?

331
00:23:04,618 --> 00:23:06,018
这不会是一次自杀任务
It won't be a suicide mission if McKay and Zelenka

332
00:23:06,018 --> 00:23:09,018
如果McKay和Zelenka找到了
可以远程控制小飞船的办法的话
can figure out a way to remote-control the jumpers.

333
00:23:11,618 --> 00:23:12,618
你能做到么?
Can you do it?

334
00:23:12,618 --> 00:23:13,618
- 据我所知, 这是有可能的
- 是真的么?
I knew this was going to happen. Is that a fact?

335
00:23:13,618 --> 00:23:14,618
是的, 是真的!
Yes, it's a fact.

336
00:23:14,618 --> 00:23:17,618
你带着你的枪和士兵出现在这里
Look, you show up here
with your guns and your brush cuts,

337
00:23:17,618 --> 00:23:20,818
不过要真正拯救这个城市的时候
你却转向科学家求助!
but when it comes to actually saving the city,

338
00:23:20,818 --> 00:23:22,818
而且每次你的要求都是不可能的
you turn to the scientists, and
every time, what you ask is impossible.

339
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,918
你上次睡觉时在什么时候, 博士?
When was the last time you slept, Doctor?

340
00:23:24,918 --> 00:23:26,918
住嘴, 我有主意了
Shut up. I have an idea.

341
00:23:26,918 --> 00:23:28,518
- 那个椅子
- 当然, 那个椅子
The chair. Of course, the chair.

342
00:23:28,518 --> 00:23:30,318
问题是, 怎么把它接入飞船系统
The problem is tying it
to the jumper's systems.

343
00:23:30,318 --> 00:23:31,918
同时不让发电机过载
Without overloading the generators.

344
00:23:31,918 --> 00:23:34,918
可能可以使用小飞船自己的飞弹
作为一种推进的方法
Possibly using the drones on the
jumpers themselves as a means of propulsion...

345
00:23:34,918 --> 00:23:37,418
同时将惯性阻尼器增加到最大
while increasing the inertial dampening to maximum.

346
00:23:37,418 --> 00:23:38,718
操作起来可能比较困难
不过确实是可能的
It won't be very maneuverable,
but possibly, possibly...

347
00:23:38,718 --> 00:23:41,218
- 有可能
- 那就是说可以了?
Is that a "yes?"

348
00:23:41,218 --> 00:23:42,618
不, 只是有可能
No, it's a "possibly."

349
00:23:42,618 --> 00:23:45,318
我会认为是!
一艘飞船可以造成多大的损坏?
I'll take it. How much damage
can one puddle jumper do?

350
00:23:45,318 --> 00:23:50,718
我也有个主意
我想我知道我们可以去哪里再弄一个核弹
I've got an idea about that, too. I think I know where
 we can get another nuke.

351
00:23:52,718 --> 00:23:55,518
少校, 我不知道Genii
对我们处境会有多大的同情心
Major, I don't know how sympathetic
the Genii will be to our situation.

352
00:23:55,518 --> 00:23:57,218
Genii?
The Genii?

353
00:23:57,218 --> 00:23:59,618
他们不是想测试他们的武器么?
现在机会来了
They want to test their weapon. Now's your chance.

354
00:23:59,618 --> 00:24:01,618
让我过去!
Let me pass!

355
00:24:03,318 --> 00:24:04,618
我要跟Weir博士说话!
I need to talk to Dr. Weir!

356
00:24:05,618 --> 00:24:06,618
Teyla?
Teyla?

357
00:24:08,318 --> 00:24:09,318
怎么了?
What's the matter?

358
00:24:09,718 --> 00:24:12,318
幽灵
他们已经进入亚特兰蒂斯了!
The Wraith... they are in Atlantis.

359
00:24:22,818 --> 00:24:23,818
幽灵飞行员进行自杀式飞行
The Wraith piloting the kamikaze ships
beam into the city right before they hit.

360
00:24:23,818 --> 00:24:26,518
在撞向城市之前, 通过光柱潜入进来
So they're trying to take the city intact.

361
00:24:26,518 --> 00:24:29,118
这就是说它们试图完整无缺的夺下城市
它们到底有多少?
How many are we talking about?

362
00:24:29,118 --> 00:24:30,318
有多少梭镖飞船坠毁了?
 How many darts crashed?

363
00:24:30,318 --> 00:24:33,318
大概20到30之间
内部传感器仍然不能工作
Between 20 and 30,
and internal sensors are still down.

364
00:24:33,318 --> 00:24:35,918
好吧, 我们有这个
Well, we have this.

365
00:24:36,718 --> 00:24:37,918
这个不能区分任何幽灵
It can't differentiate between Wraith and human,

366
00:24:37,918 --> 00:24:40,918
不过如果我们将基地中所有的人
限制在一个特定的区域
but if we confine all base
personnel to the designated areas,

367
00:24:40,918 --> 00:24:44,618
那么这里显示的区域之外的小点
就很有可能是目标
the blips that show up out
of bounds will be the likely targets.

368
00:24:44,618 --> 00:24:45,618
让我看看
Let me see that.

369
00:24:45,618 --> 00:24:47,718
对你没有任何用, 你需要特定的基因
It won't do you any good. You need the gene.

370
00:24:50,418 --> 00:24:51,918
我也接受了基因治疗
I got the gene therapy, too.

371
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:55,118
我们希望能提供帮助
We wish to help.

372
00:24:58,218 --> 00:24:59,218
这是一个很大的城市, 上校
This is quite a large city,

373
00:25:00,218 --> 00:25:02,218
你需要尽可能多的人开展搜索工作
you need
as many people searching as possible.

374
00:25:03,318 --> 00:25:06,618
她是能第一个感觉到幽灵存在的人
She is the one who sensed the
Wraith presence in the first place.

375
00:25:06,618 --> 00:25:08,618
上尉?
Captain.

376
00:25:11,618 --> 00:25:12,818
给这些人一些武器
Get some weapons for these people.

377
00:25:13,218 --> 00:25:15,818
是的, 长官
Yes, sir.

378
00:25:25,318 --> 00:25:27,418
在这个基地中, 还有其他人
拥有古人的基因
There's other people on this base that possess
the Ancient gene...

379
00:25:27,418 --> 00:25:31,418
例如, Kusanagi博士
我相信她一定愿意帮助的
Dr. Kusanagi, for example. I'm sure she'd relish the opportunity to help.

380
00:25:31,418 --> 00:25:34,918
是的! 我现在又累又饿, 坐下去!
Carson, 它已经没有飞弹了
I am exhausted and starving, so sit down. Carson, it's out of drones.

381
00:25:34,918 --> 00:25:37,218
你做不了任何破坏,  即便是你想的话
You couldn't do any damage if you wanted to.

382
00:25:38,418 --> 00:25:39,418
谢谢
Thank you.

383
00:25:40,418 --> 00:25:43,418
好了, 我们开始做事
下到航空港去, 到了之后用无线电通知我!
Okay, we're in business. Radio me when you get there.
Head down to the jumper bay.

384
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:19,648
你还好吧?
You okay?

385
00:27:21,074 --> 00:27:23,431
下一次, 你去当诱饵怎么样?
How about next time you can be the bait?

386
00:27:23,667 --> 00:27:28,667
下一次, 也许吧
好了, 这边!
Yeah, maybe. Next time. Okay, this way.

387
00:27:33,812 --> 00:27:35,981
我们刚刚收到Genii的回复
We just received the response from the Genii.

388
00:27:35,981 --> 00:27:37,336
我们听听吧
Let's hear it.

389
00:27:40,464 --> 00:27:45,464
我是Genii人Prenom
我们很欢迎我们两个民族之间能够开展对话
This is Prenum of the Genii. We welcome the opportunity to
 open a dialogue between our two people.

390
00:27:46,739 --> 00:27:50,401
你们排个代表过来
一个人, 不许带武器
Send your representative... one person, unarmed.

391
00:27:50,401 --> 00:27:52,896
- 就是这些?
- 是的, 女士
Is that all? Yes, ma'am.

392
00:27:52,896 --> 00:27:53,868
Everett上校, 我是Weir
Colonel Everett, this is Weir.

393
00:27:53,868 --> 00:27:57,018
正如我们所希望的
Genii要求我们派去一个代表
As we'd hoped, the Genii have
asked us to send a representative.

394
00:27:57,518 --> 00:27:59,511
我准备过去
I'm set to go.

395
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,769
好, 我找不出比你更有资格的人了
Good. I can't imagine anyone more qualified.

396
00:28:01,769 --> 00:28:04,242
如果你搞定的话, 我会请你喝一杯的
Pull this off, and I'll buy you a drink.

397
00:28:04,548 --> 00:28:07,348
就这样
拨通星际之门
You've got a deal. Dial the gate.

398
00:28:44,176 --> 00:28:48,284
Weir博士, 我是Prenom
Dr. Weir... I am Prenum of the Genii.

399
00:28:49,055 --> 00:28:54,055
我非常惊奇, 不, 是震惊
你竟然有胆量到这里来
I'm rather surprised... no, astonished that
you would have the audacity to come here.

400
00:28:55,282 --> 00:28:57,848
你已经收到我们的消息了
幽灵就在我们门口了
You heard our message. The Wraith are at our doorstep.

401
00:28:58,411 --> 00:29:02,691
可以想象, 对你们濒临灭亡的处境
我们感到十分的欣喜
And we are understandably delighted
at the prospect of your demise.

402
00:29:03,582 --> 00:29:07,904
可能是这样吧
不过, 我们有你们想要的东西
That may be so... but, still, we have something that you want.

403
00:29:09,553 --> 00:29:10,771
C4
C-4.

404
00:29:10,771 --> 00:29:17,973
不仅仅是那个, 我们有机会替你们
测试你们的武器, 而不用担心会伤到你们
More than that. We have an opportunity for you to test your weapon

405
00:29:17,973 --> 00:29:19,680
而且还有可能打败幽灵
at no risk to yourselves,
and a chance to strike at the Wraith.

406
00:29:22,129 --> 00:29:23,721
你无法想象它们已经离得多进了
You have no idea how close they are.

407
00:29:24,056 --> 00:29:29,056
幽灵曾经来过, 博士
The Wraith have come, Doctor.

408
00:29:32,275 --> 00:29:33,808
六天以前
Six days ago.

409
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:40,567
幸运的是, 我们提前探测到了它们
并且及时关闭了我们的反应堆
Fortunately, we detected their approach and we were able to shut down our reactors in time.

410
00:29:41,234 --> 00:29:43,218
在地面上, 我们失去了好几百人
Hundreds of lives were lost on the surface,

411
00:29:44,004 --> 00:29:47,995
不过还是有数千人获救了
因为我们在地下的设施没有被发现
but thousands more were saved because
our underground complex went undetected.

412
00:29:48,221 --> 00:29:52,983
因此你应该知道, 对Genii的威胁
已经到来了而且已经过去了
So, you see, the threat to the Genii has come and gone.

413
00:29:55,499 --> 00:30:00,321
只要幽灵没有注意
它们不再会对这个星球感兴趣了
So far as the Wraith are concerned, this planet is no longer of interest to them.

414
00:30:02,196 --> 00:30:05,101
我们有McKay博士提供给我们的设计图
We have the design that Dr. McKay provided for us,

415
00:30:05,457 --> 00:30:09,756
现在我们的原型核弹已经接近完成了
and our prototype bombs are nearly complete.

416
00:30:10,069 --> 00:30:12,028
那你为什么要我到这里来?
So why would you ask me to come here?

417
00:30:13,306 --> 00:30:20,050
这样我们就可以用你的命
来交换C4
So that we may trade the C-4... for your life.

418
00:31:01,001 --> 00:31:01,487
该死!
Damn it.

419
00:31:12,743 --> 00:31:16,712
我是Everett
幽灵刚刚破坏了我们的一个发电机
This is Everett. The Wraith just took out one of our generators.

420
00:31:16,894 --> 00:31:19,952
最近的发电机站是哪个?
三号!
What's the nearest generator station? Number three,

421
00:31:19,952 --> 00:31:21,147
Teyla的队伍更近!
but Teyla's group is closer.

422
00:31:21,245 --> 00:31:21,781
Teyla?
<i>Teyla?</i>

423
00:31:21,965 --> 00:31:23,436
我们已经在路上了, 少校!
We are already on our way, Major.

424
00:31:24,589 --> 00:31:27,507
我已经给你们C4了
I have already offered you the C-4.

425
00:31:27,507 --> 00:31:28,860
你现在想要我们的武器原型进行交换
And you want our prototype weapons in exchange.

426
00:31:30,563 --> 00:31:32,566
这种交易对Genii来说不公平
That's not a bargain for the Genii.

427
00:31:33,205 --> 00:31:35,650
如果你现在有C4的话, 你会怎么做?
What would you do if you had the C-4 right now?

428
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:37,374
把它结合到你们的武器中去?
Incorporate it into your weapons?

429
00:31:37,374 --> 00:31:38,668
- 是的
- 那么你需要测试他们!
Yes. And you would test them.

430
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,851
当然
Of course.

431
00:31:41,548 --> 00:31:46,544
我正提供给你机会
可以在幽灵的母船上测试你的武器
I am offering you the chance to test
your weapon design on a Wraith hive ship,

432
00:31:46,694 --> 00:31:48,112
而且绝不会伤害到你的人民
at no risk to your own people,

433
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:50,586
而且你们仍然还可以制造更多
and still have enough to build dozens more.

434
00:31:51,872 --> 00:31:54,129
现在, 你要么是太自傲, 要么是太愚蠢
以至于不能看到...
Now, if you are too proud or too stupid to see...

435
00:31:54,129 --> 00:31:54,769
说话小心点, 博士!
Be careful, Doctor.

436
00:31:54,769 --> 00:31:56,269
我现在顾不上了!
I am way past careful.

437
00:31:57,098 --> 00:31:58,328
现在你知道我们的协议
Now, you know what the deal is,

438
00:31:58,561 --> 00:32:01,486
是接受还是拒绝, 由你吧
and it's a damn good one, so take it or leave it.

439
00:32:14,413 --> 00:32:15,581
好了, 就是这了!
Yeah. That's it.

440
00:32:16,321 --> 00:32:18,487
OK, 测试一下
Okay... let's give it a test.

441
00:32:19,141 --> 00:32:21,552
准备
<i>Standing by.</i>

442
00:32:24,534 --> 00:32:28,882
Carson? 我需要你清除所有杂念
只想着小飞船
<i>Carson,</i> I need you to clear your mind and think about the puddle jumper.

443
00:32:28,882 --> 00:32:31,170
想着让它启动起来
Think about bringing it online.

444
00:32:32,724 --> 00:32:34,402
快点, 快点, 快点
Come on, come on, come on...

445
00:32:34,916 --> 00:32:36,708
现在就启动吧
any time now.

446
00:32:36,708 --> 00:32:38,511
Carson
Carson...

447
00:32:39,446 --> 00:32:43,071
我知道你可以做到
启动小飞船
look, I know you can do this. Just activate the puddle jumper.

448
00:32:50,504 --> 00:32:54,996
好, 好, 好, 好
Rodney, Rodney, 起作用了
Yes! <i>Yes! Yes! Yes!</i> <i>Rodney, Rodney,</i> it works!

449
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:08,486
给我个无线电
Give me your radio.

450
00:33:12,649 --> 00:33:13,516
我是Weir
<i>This is Weir.</i>

451
00:33:14,795 --> 00:33:16,049
我已经拿到原型核弹了
I've got the prototypes.

452
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,228
原型核弹, 好
Prototypes. Right.

453
00:33:50,598 --> 00:33:52,904
这应该是最后几个了
That should be the last of them.

454
00:33:57,899 --> 00:33:58,970
上校?
Colonel.

455
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:03,741
做得好, 博士
我必须承认, 我深受感动
Well done, Doctor. I...I have to admit it, I am impressed.

456
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:06,236
好吧, 也许对我来说, 仍然还有希望
Well, maybe there's hope for me yet.

457
00:34:07,531 --> 00:34:09,084
我坐在你的位子上了
I'm in your chair.

458
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:10,390
我认为那是你的位子
I thought it was your chair.

459
00:34:10,428 --> 00:34:11,930
好吧, 是的, 我不是经常要坐
Yeah, well, I... I don't sit much.

460
00:34:11,957 --> 00:34:15,680
我要去检查...
I was just going over the...

461
00:34:17,061 --> 00:34:17,917
我们有个麻烦
We have a problem.

462
00:34:18,613 --> 00:34:20,048
我们有很多麻烦
We have a lot of problems.

463
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:23,027
我刚刚检查完Genii的核装置
它们没有完成
I just finished examining the Genii nuclear devices. They're incomplete.

464
00:34:23,027 --> 00:34:24,368
我可以完成, 不过这需要时间
I could finish it, but it's going to take time.

465
00:34:24,368 --> 00:34:25,176
要多长时间?
How much time?

466
00:34:25,176 --> 00:34:26,018
差不多一天
About a day.

467
00:34:26,667 --> 00:34:28,246
我们没有一天的时间了, 博士
We don't have a day, Doctor.

468
00:34:28,536 --> 00:34:30,850
正如我所说的, 我们有个麻烦
Well, like I said, we have a problem.

469
00:34:46,466 --> 00:34:47,729
你要见我, Rodney?
You wanted to see me, Rodney?

470
00:34:48,258 --> 00:34:49,265
是的, 是的
我需要有东西让我保持清醒
Yes. I need something to keep me awake.

471
00:34:49,265 --> 00:34:49,724
是的, 我也是
Yeah, me too.

472
00:34:49,724 --> 00:34:50,781
我已经为你做过事了
I've already given you something.

473
00:34:50,781 --> 00:34:54,083
好吧, 我们在这里是在造一个核弹
保持清醒是先决条件
We're building nuclear bombs. Staying awake is sort of a prerequisite. Snappy.

474
00:34:54,083 --> 00:34:58,266
爽快. 好吧, 我会再给你打一针兴奋剂
坚持住!
All right, I'll get you another stimulant. Carry on.

475
00:34:58,398 --> 00:34:59,524
谢谢
Thank you.

476
00:35:08,543 --> 00:35:10,135
对你的一些人民, 我感到非常抱歉
I'm sorry you lost some of your people.

477
00:35:11,162 --> 00:35:12,585
死了很多人, 上校
Many have died, Colonel.

478
00:35:12,585 --> 00:35:15,396
我是四号飞船
我们已经看到幽灵的母船了
<i>This is jumper four.</i> <i>We have a visual on the hive ships.</i>

479
00:35:15,568 --> 00:35:16,768
我是Everett
This is Everett.

480
00:35:17,043 --> 00:35:20,464
四号飞船刚刚报告
幽灵的母船已经逼近这个行星了
Jumper four has just informed us
the Wraith hive ships are approaching the planet.

481
00:35:21,641 --> 00:35:24,436
防御队伍, 各就各位
Defense team, to your positions.

482
00:35:25,803 --> 00:35:26,780
博士?
Doctor?

483
00:35:30,268 --> 00:35:31,123
谢谢
Thank you.

484
00:35:34,118 --> 00:35:35,291
我是Weir
This is Weir.

485
00:35:37,144 --> 00:35:38,726
我知道你们现在都已经很疲惫了
Now, I know how tired you all are,

486
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:42,379
在过去几天里
让你们去做的事太多了
and how much we have asked of you these past few days.

487
00:35:43,862 --> 00:35:45,600
值得乐观的是
Daedalus号马上就会到了
<i>Hopefully, the Daedalus will arrive soon,</i>

488
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:48,223
不过在那之前
我们的命运仍然掌握在我们自己手中
<i>but until that happens,</i>
<i>our fate is in our own hands.</i>

489
00:35:49,997 --> 00:35:52,697
如果在这场战斗中
我们的任务失败了
<i>If, during the course of</i>
<i>this battle, that mission fails,</i>

490
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,326
我会下达撤退的命令
I will give the order to evacuate.

491
00:35:56,916 --> 00:35:59,390
现在我们希望那不会发生
Now, we all hope it won't come to that,

492
00:36:00,109 --> 00:36:02,956
但如果确实发生了, 不要犹豫
but if it does... don't hesitate.

493
00:36:06,102 --> 00:36:07,962
就是这些
That is all.

494
00:36:12,649 --> 00:36:13,849
没时间了
Time's up.

495
00:36:13,849 --> 00:36:15,845
好, 正好, 我们也完成了
Oh, what a coincidence. We're done.

496
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:25,044
那么, 去椅子所在的房间吧
Oh... so... chair room?

497
00:36:26,762 --> 00:36:27,797
好吧
Right.

498
00:36:30,411 --> 00:36:33,887
上校, 我们准备去航空港
给小飞船装上核弹
Colonel. We're heading into the bay to load up the jumpers.

499
00:36:34,243 --> 00:36:35,596
知道了
<i>Understood.</i>

500
00:36:43,221 --> 00:36:46,585
记住, 我欠你一杯
Remember... I owe you that drink.

501
00:37:00,016 --> 00:37:02,879
慢点, 慢点, 慢点
就在这里
Slow. Slow, slow, slow. Right here.

502
00:37:14,128 --> 00:37:15,620
Sheppard, 你准备好了么?
Sheppard, are you ready?

503
00:37:23,554 --> 00:37:24,439
Rodney?
Rodney?

504
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:26,923
发电机能量输出不太正常
The generator's not powering up like it should be.

505
00:38:02,661 --> 00:38:06,311
它们又发起了一波进攻
少校, 我们需要立刻开始!
They're sending in another wave! Major, we need to go!

506
00:38:39,888 --> 00:38:40,946
McKay!
McKay!

507
00:38:41,082 --> 00:38:42,865
有地方不对劲!
能量级别正在下降!
There's something wrong.
Power levels are dropping!

508
00:38:48,634 --> 00:38:50,918
Rodney, 还是没有动静!
Rodney, nothing is happening.

509
00:38:57,795 --> 00:38:59,754
为什么没有小飞船升空?
Why are there no jumpers in the air?

510
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:02,864
我们一定是用光了二号发电机的能量
它已经死了!
<i>We must have exhausted the mark II's energy output.</i> It's dead!

511
00:39:03,026 --> 00:39:03,985
太久了, Rodney
So long, Rodney.

512
00:39:03,985 --> 00:39:07,485
应该有办法来...少校!
There's got to be a way to... Major!

513
00:39:19,609 --> 00:39:21,596
到上面去, 它们已经在基地中了
Heads up, people! They're in the base.

514
00:39:25,217 --> 00:39:26,965
上校, 我们有麻烦了
Colonel, we have a problem.

515
00:39:28,069 --> 00:39:28,718
是什么?
What is it?

516
00:39:29,305 --> 00:39:31,328
我们可能需要下令撤退了
<i>We may need to give the order to evacuate.</i>

517
00:39:31,795 --> 00:39:32,832
Elizabeth, 等等!
Elizabeth, wait!

518
00:39:35,552 --> 00:39:36,276
你不能!
You can't.

519
00:39:37,169 --> 00:39:39,695
我必须这样去做, 你是知道的
I have to, and you know it.

520
00:39:39,941 --> 00:39:40,440
John?
John...

521
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:46,980
去吧
Go.

522
00:39:59,546 --> 00:40:01,431
该死的小飞船到底是怎么了
What's the status on that damn jumper?

523
00:40:03,208 --> 00:40:04,625
已经在路上了
It's on its way.

524
00:40:28,757 --> 00:40:31,218
Weir博士
Sheppard少校已经驾驶着小飞船出去了
<i>Dr. Weir, major Sheppard is taking the jumper out.</i>

525
00:40:31,218 --> 00:40:35,164
我知道了, Zelenka博士
开始准备二号飞船
I'm aware of that, Dr. Zelenka. Start prepping jumper two.

526
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,969
Teyla, 我听到了枪声
你那边情况怎么样?
Teyla, I'm hearing gunfire. What's your status?

527
00:40:42,545 --> 00:40:44,219
Teyla, 你能听到么?
Teyla, do you hear me?

528
00:40:45,046 --> 00:40:47,188
Teyla!
Teyla?

529
00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:10,520
希望我引爆这一个之后
就用不上另外一个了
Hopefully, if I take this one out, the other one will back off.

530
00:41:12,571 --> 00:41:17,571
走, 走, 走!
Go, go, go, go!

531
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:19,835
我们不能呆在这里了, Elizabeth
We can't stay here, Elizabeth.

532
00:41:19,835 --> 00:41:21,965
他是对的
它们正通过光柱从四处近来
He's right, they're beaming in all over the place.

533
00:41:22,458 --> 00:41:26,984
我们哪儿也不去
还没到那步
We're not going anywhere. Not yet.

534
00:41:36,082 --> 00:41:39,980
你知道, 如果这有效的话
可能需要有人再做一次
You know, if this works, somebody might have to do it again.

535
00:41:40,972 --> 00:41:42,046
知道
Understood.

536
00:41:43,486 --> 00:41:44,181
快, 快!
Come on. Keep up!

537
00:41:47,395 --> 00:41:48,428
在那里!
Over there.

538
00:42:03,686 --> 00:42:05,376
是你让Sheppard驾驶那个飞船的?
You let Sheppard fly that jumper?

539
00:42:10,317 --> 00:42:13,365
帮我准备好自毁程序
万一这失败的话
Help me arm the self-destruct in case this fails.

540
00:42:37,981 --> 00:42:40,168
它们没有察觉到我的靠近
They haven't detected my approach.

541
00:42:42,413 --> 00:42:44,795
核弹已经准备好了
The weapon is armed and ready.

542
00:42:48,673 --> 00:42:51,212
我就要进去了
I'm going in.

543
00:42:51,828 --> 00:42:54,443
