老爸老妈浪漫史
第九季  第十二集

5
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:04,360
星期五  晚上8点

6
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:04,360
离婚礼还有22小时

7
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,710
"让派对开始吧"
"Let's get this party started."

8
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,260
能按下那个按钮吗
Hey, can you push the button?

9
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,510
不许碰那个按钮
Do not touch that button.

10
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:14,160
-按一下嘛  -别按
- Just give it a little push. - Don't push it.

11
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:14,990
-按一下  -别听他的
- Just push it a little. - Don't listen to him.

12
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:16,660
-按一点  按一点  -不许按
- Half of it, halfway, halfway... - Don't even touch it.

13
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,120
我为什么不能按这个按钮
Why can't I push the button?

14
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,430
因为只要巴尼看到按钮  无论什么按钮  
Because whenever Barney sees a button-- any button--

15
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:21,870
他都得按一下
as to push it.

16
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:25,230
抱歉
Sorry.

17
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,820
你这么生气干嘛啊
Why are you so mad?

18
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,880
因为我的彩排晚宴
Because my rehearsal dinner

19
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,100
本应该在十分钟前开始
was supposed to start ten minutes ago.

20
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:35,090
但现在我不但没有狼吞虎咽地吃
But instead of stuffing my face with hors d'oeuvres

21
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,180
惦记了好几个月的饭前点心
that I have been dreaming about for months,

22
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:42,040
反而是在激光枪战游戏场的保安室
I am in a laser tag security office,

23
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,570
等着我的未婚夫因为制造骚乱
waiting for the police to arrest my fiance

24
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,170
而被警察逮捕
for causing a disturbance.

25
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:48,480
你说了"未婚夫"
Hey, you said "Fiance."

26
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,760
那是个好兆头
That's a good sign.

27
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,990
你觉得按一下那个按钮如何
Now what do you say we give that old button a push?

28
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,320
好好看着我的脸  巴尼
Take a good look at this face, Barney, okay?

29
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,870
这对将来很有帮助
'Cause it'll be useful for the future.

30
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,290
这是我"超级生气"的脸
This is my "Pretty mad" face.

31
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,430
我觉得不是
Well, then, we've got a problem.

32
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,250
因为这更像是你"超级饿"的脸
'Cause it looks a lot like your "pretty hungry" face.

33
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,890
我要错过培根卷无花果了
I'm missing the bacon-wrapped figs!

34
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,700
快点按那个按钮
Please push the button!

35
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:22,680
这儿怎么这么冷
Why is it so cold in here?

36
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,260
你是想耍阴招逼供吗
You trying to get me to talk or something?

37
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,120
不想
Not really.

38
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,920
其实你只要安静地坐着就可以了
In fact, if you could just sit there quietly...

39
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,300
好吧  我招
Fine, I'll talk.

40
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,620
得从几个月前说起
It all started a few months ago,

41
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:33,830
我有了一个史上最棒的点子
when I had the most awesome idea ever.

42
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,190
几个月前

43
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:36,390
激光枪战的彩排晚宴
Laser tag rehearsal dinner!

44
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:38,510
这是你史上最烂的点子
That might be the worst idea you've ever had,

45
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:39,810
等于是烂到极致了
which is saying a lot.

46
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,850
说一个我的烂点子
Name one bad idea I've ever had.

竞争市长
The time you ran for mayor.

53
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,420
我还有一万两千个小徽章  上面写着
I still have 12,000 buttons that say,

54
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,660
"我唯一在意的投票[头]在我的裤子里"
"The only poll I care about is in my pants."

55
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,760
巴尼  筹备婚礼的关键是妥协
Barney, planning a wedding is all about compromise.

56
00:01:58,780 --> 00:01:59,640
你还记得
Do you remember that one night,

57
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,200
我们订婚后的那一晚吗
right after we got engaged?

58
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,940
几个月前

59
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,250
婚礼在哪里举行呀
Where is this wedding gonna be, anyway?

60

我觉得在加拿大结婚挺好的
You know, I thought it might be nice to get married in Canada.

61
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,990
毕竟那是我的家乡...
I mean, it's where I'm from, and...

62
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:10,380
好吧
Okay.

63

00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:20,740
该马修了

70
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,790
加拿大  你们去做什么  
Canada? What are you gonna do,

71
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:24,090
雇一只狗拉的雪橇或搭帐篷吗

72
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,240

00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:31,240
弹风琴的会带着连指手套吗
Oh, does the organist play wearing mittens?

77
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,900
加拿大  如果新娘带着连指手套
Canada? How are you gonna slip the ring

78
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,110
你要怎么给她戴上戒指啊
the bride's finger if she's wearing mittens?

79
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,710
连续两个连指手套笑话
Two mitten jokes in a row?

80
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,040
那...你们差不多说完了吧
So... you're pretty much done, then?

81
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,160
<i>孩子们  其实还早着呢</i>
<i>Kids... we weren't even close.</i>

82
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,080

83
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,860

85
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:48,470
加拿大
Canada.

86
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,480
你们要穿着雪地靴
What, are you gonna walk down the aisle

87
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,470

每个人都能买医保吗

90
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,850
这样大家就不用纠结

91
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,950
到底是选择破产还是治病
and treating a life-threatening illness?

92
00:02:54,280 --> 00:03:00,990
加拿大没有医保者  住院费十分昂贵

93
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,050
加拿大
Canada?

碰撞试验傻蛋乐队的歌吗

96
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,740
有意思的地方在于  傻蛋都能组乐队
See, it's funny 'cause who gets a band?

97
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,680
够了  这只是个想法
Enough. It was just an idea.

98
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,690
好了好了
Okay, okay.

99
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,690
说真的  罗宾  在纽约办婚礼
Seriously, Robin, doing it here in New York

100
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,380
会更方便  因为我们的朋友
would be easier, since all of our friends

101
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,190
和家人大多都在这里
and a lot of our family are here.

102
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:20,520
但是我不想让你的婚礼留下遗憾
But... I want you to have the wedding that you want.

103
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,130
如果想在加拿大办
So if it's Canada...

104
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,530
你说一声就行
just say the word.

105
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,440
然后用法语再说一遍
And then say it again in French.

106
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,440
加拿大有法语区

107
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,530
看到没  我妥协了
See? I compromised.

108
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,530
好吧
Fine.

109
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,610
那我们举办一个美好高雅的彩排晚宴
We'll just have a nice, tasteful rehearsal dinner.

110
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:37,220
地点可以定在法国餐厅
Maybe at a French restaurant.

111
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,930
我整好知道个地方
I know just the place.

112
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,530
餐厅名是什么
What's the name of the restaurant?

113
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:43,790
激  光枪战
La... ser tag.

114
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,080
我刚在想
You know, I was thinking about

115
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,110
要送你们什么婚礼礼物
what to get you guys for a wedding gift.

116
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:48,820
你们都知道
As you know,

117
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,290
我是送结婚礼物的大师
I'm kind of the wedding gift master.

118
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:54,050
这次关于彩排晚宴的谈话
And, well, all this talk of the rehearsal dinner

119
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:56,380
给我一个绝佳的灵感
gives me a fantastic idea.

120
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,400
我想重新去学钢琴
I've been meaning to start taking piano lessons again.

121
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,100
不
No.

122
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,390
-不准弹钢琴  -各位
- No piano time. - Guys!

123
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,690
让我表演个节目啊
Just let me perform something.

124
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,090
我会轻弹钢琴键
I'll-I'll tickle the keys.

125
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:04,990
肯定很好听
It'll be great.

126
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:07,340
不行  除非你打扮成列勃拉斯
Not even if you dressed up as Liberace.

127
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:07,340
美国钢琴演奏家  同性恋
衣着十分华丽

128
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,830
我就打扮成列勃拉斯
What if I dressed up as Liberace?

129
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:09,850
-同意   -同意
- Sold! - Sold.

130
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,140
本来就这么决定了
And that was the end of it.

131
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,080
谁知道在我的告别单身派对上
Until my bachelor party.

132
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:16,920
我来猜猜
Let me guess:

133
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,030
有个脱衣舞娘
there was a stripper.

134
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,730
你们玩得挺开心
You had a little fun.

135
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:23,790
或许还拍了些不雅照
Maybe took some ill-advised pictures.

136
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,590
接着你就发现
Next thing you know,

137
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,500
她快把你勒索到破产了
she's blackmailing you into bankruptcy,

138
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,940
千辛万苦得来的医学学位证只能挂在
and your medical degree's hanging on the wall

139
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,880
激光枪战保安室的墙上
of a laser tag security office!

140
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,410
不是这样的
No.

141
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:34,950
在告别单身派对的那晚 
The night of my bachelor party,

142
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,620
我的朋友们带我去了一家破烂的旅馆
my friends took me to a crappy hotel,

143
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,480
请我的前任未婚妻来跳脱衣舞
hired my ex-fiance to be the stripper,

144
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,910
我一口气输掉几千大洋
I lost thousands of dollars,

145
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:41,900
好友还被人砍断了手
and my best friend even had his hand cut off.

146
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,560
那可谓是我人生中最倒霉的一晚
It would've been the worst night of all time

147
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,290
但其实那一切是我集智慧
if the whole thing hadn't been a prank

148
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:48,090
和美貌于一身的未婚妻策划的恶作剧
planned by my beautiful, amazing fiance.

149
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,490
她故意让我难过  就是为了给我
She put me through hell just to give me the best

150
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,330
生命中最大的惊喜  特别是还安排
surprise of my life...which, p.s.,included an appearance

151
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:54,410
我最爱的演员出现
by my favorite actor--

152
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,030
非A片演员哦
non-porn category.

153
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,220
听起来很不错嘛
Wow, that sounds pretty cool.

154
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,150
是不错  除了一点以外
Yeah. Except pretty not cool,

155
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,370
他总是念叨说也要整我一次
because he kept talking about how he was gonna get me back,

156
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,680
于是  几天之后
and sure enough, a few days later...

157
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,250
罗宾  有件事我实在无法开口
Robin, there's no good way to say this.

158
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:09,630
我犯下了弥天大错
I've made a huge mistake.

159
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,200
我不能和你举行婚礼了
I can't go through with the wedding.

160
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,080
什么
What?

161
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,210
我真的很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

162
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,010
但我必须在一切无法挽回之前
I-I just... I had to tell you

163
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,330
告诉你真相
before it was too late.

164
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,780
-天啊  你是说真的  -是的
- Oh, my God, you're serious. - Yeah.

165
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,690
既然这是我的公寓
And since this is my apartment,

166
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,370
所以你还是搬出去吧
I think that you should move out.

167
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,130
好吧
Fine.

168
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,920
小狗狗
Puppies!

169
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,310
多精彩的恶作剧  对吧
I know. Great prank, right?

170
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,700
这也太糟糕了
That is awful.

171
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,590
你这人脑子有病吧
You're a frickin' weirdo.

172
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,120
有病到极点的怪胎
Such a weirdo.

173
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,530
小心点  别弄到我袍子
Careful, watch the robe.

174
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,430
总之  基于某些你们和罗宾才懂
Anyway, for reasons only you guys and Robin

175
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,550
而我这种正常人完全不能理解的原因
but nobody normal like me would understand,

176
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:53,760
她气得发疯
she got cranky.

177
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:55,580
然后她就定下了规矩
And she laid down the law.

178
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,250
不准再搞惊喜了
No more surprises.

179
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,040
可你不是最爱惊喜吗
But you love surprises.

180
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,000
就像我最爱舔自己一样
Almost as much as I love lickin' myself!

181
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,580
是指我爱舔  不是这只小狗哦
That was me talking, not the puppy.

182
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,180
巴尼  你的惊喜太过分了
Barney, the surprises are out of hand

183
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,480
也该停手了
and they have to stop.

184
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,540
-一言为定  -可是
- Deal? - But...

185
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,530
-一言为定  -人家
- Deal? - But...

186
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:10,190
-一言为定  -小屁股[音似]
- Deal? - Butt...

187
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:11,290
巴尼
Barney...

188
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:12,390
好吧
Fine.

189
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,370
poppycock小狗鸡鸡  还有胡说的意思

190
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,760
说好了
Deal.

191
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,060
真是的
Man.

192
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:20,500
这"不准搞惊喜"的规定真是太不公平了
This whole "no more surprises" thing is so unfair.

193
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,670
谁会订这种规矩呀
Who does that?

194
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,920
巴尼  "不再有惊喜"
Barney, the "no more surprises" thing

195
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,070
才是婚姻中最棒的地方
is the best part of being married.

196
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,310
真的  每天早上当我醒来
It's true. When I wake up in the morning,

197
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,780
我就知道莉莉的口气是什么味道
I know what Lily's breath is gonna smell like.

198
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,930
就像是玫瑰花的芳香
It's like... roses.

199
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:33,500
难道你真的愿意结婚以后
Do you really want a marriage

200
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,760
每天疑神疑鬼猜测
where you have this paranoia

201
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,890
罗宾是不是躲在每个角落
that Robin's hiding around every corner,

202
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,260
策划各种恶作剧来报复你
planning to get you back with some crazy new prank?

203
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,990
你说得太对了
You're absolutely right.

204
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,170
谢谢你  莉莉
Thank you, Lily.

205
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,250
不对  是我说的  我在这里
No, th... that was me, over here.

206
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:44,940
他根本就没听进去
He wasn't listening.

207
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,300
如果你们说的
If you guys are saying

208
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,550
和我想的是同一个意思的话
what I think you're saying...

209
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,570
应该不一样  你继续
Probably not. Go on.

210
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:49,970
那就一定表示
...then that must mean...

211
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:50,680
其实不一定
No, it doesn't.

212
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,880
罗宾绝对秘密策划了一个
...that Robin is planning a surprise

213
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,390
激光枪战彩排晚宴
laser tag rehearsal dinner!

214
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,490
老兄  罗宾才没有安排什么
Dude, Robin is not planning

215
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,610
秘密的激光枪战彩排晚宴呢
a surprise laser tag rehearsal dinner.

216
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:04,330
她就是有
Yes, she is.

217
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,300
-她没有  -她有的
- No, she isn't. - Yes, she is.

218
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,800
我根本没有
No, I'm not!

219
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:08,970
她有的
Yes, she is.

220
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,480
她真的没有
No, she isn't.

221
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,310
那她为什么假装
Then why did she pretend

222
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,570
嘲笑说这主意蠢到家了
to ridicule it as an idiotic idea?

223
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:17,890
因为这主意真的蠢到家了
Because it is an idiotic idea.

224
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,810
如果罗宾真的有安排什么惊喜
If Robin actually was planning a surprise,

225
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:23,010
难道她不会告诉她的首席伴娘吗
don't you think she would tell her maid of honor?

226
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,820
她不告诉你  是因为你保守秘密的能力
She didn't tell you 'cause you can keep a secret

227
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:27,000
就像我牙医收车钥匙一样
the way my dentist keeps his car keys.

228
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,430
你们不认识他  可他把钥匙搞丢了
You don't know him, but he's lost them...

229
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,470
两次
like, twice.

230
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,900
其实只有一次
Actually, just once, and...

231
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,930
另一次是放在其他口袋里了
that time they were in his other pocket.

232
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,940
你说我守不住秘密
I can't keep a secret?

233
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:38,990
他说得有道理  莉莉
He does have a point, Lily.

234
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:41,500
你这人是出了名的大嘴巴  
You're kind of famous for the old blabbity-blabbity.

235
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,460
你和黛比午餐吃得如何
How was lunch with Debbie?

236
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,500
挺好的  她怀孕了
Great. She's pregnant!

237
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,300
-糟了  她叫我不要告诉别人的  -为什么
- I'm not supposed to tell anybody. - Why not?

238
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,810
因为她正在办离婚
Because she's getting a divorce.

239
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:50,870
我怎么又说了
Damn it!

240
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,200
黛比要离婚了吗
Debbie's getting a divorce?

241
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,670
没错  她老公被她捉奸在床
Yeah, she walked in on her husband having sex.

242
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:55,990
莉莉  你到底是怎么了
Oh! Come on, Lily.

243
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,780
我们还是不要太深入细节
Well, maybe we don't need to know every gory...

244
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:58,900
小三是个男的
With a man.

245
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,280
艾得仁  你嘴巴闭紧点好吗
Will you get it together, Aldrin?!

246
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,090
你还好吧  莉莉
You okay, Lily?

247
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,720
那个小三还是她腹中骨肉的亲爹
And that guy's the father of the baby.

248
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:07,900
我要去休息一下
I gotta go lie down.

249
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,960
故事回到今天早些时候
Which brings us to earlier today,

250
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,940
罗宾当时正在安排一场假的彩排晚宴
when Robin was setting up the decoy rehearsal dinner,

251
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,770
里面摆满了假酒
complete with fake booze.

252
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,200
离彩排晚宴还有一小时

253
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,480
想用这个来充当威士忌吗
Trying to pass this off as Scotch,

254
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,710
地球人都知道这只是苹果汁
and we all know it's apple juice.

255
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,760
典型的被苹果汁灼伤食道
Typical apple juice burn.

256
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,390
巴尼  这些酒都是真的
Yes, Barney, the booze is real.

257
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,220
食物也是真的
The food is real.

258
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,520
说到这儿  培根卷无花果在哪儿呢
Ooh, speaking of which, where are the bacon-wrapped figs?

259
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,360
我看应该是
Probably at...

260
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,920
放在玩激光枪战的地方了吧
...the laser tag place,

261
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:42,470
那里才是真正举办彩排晚宴的地方
where the real rehearsal dinner's going down.

262
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,740
我说得对吗  西奥多
Isn't that right, Theodore?

263
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,810
巴尼  根本就没有激光枪战
Barney, there is no laser tag.

264
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,240
我们会好好享用一顿美餐
We're gonna have a nice dinner,

265
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,380
小酌几杯
some drinks, and then,

266
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,570
按罗宾的说法
according to Robin,

267
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:52,980
如果她的伊迪斯阿姨喝太醉
if her Aunt Edith gets drunk enough,

268
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,760
她会摘下自己的假发  然后大家一起把它当冰球打
she'll take off her wig and they'll play hockey with it.

269
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,070
胡说八道
Poppycock!

270
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,930
你知道她是怎么打算的
You know how she's gonna do it,

271
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,170
马上告诉我
and you're gonna tell me!

272
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:02,290
否则  我就把我的脸
Or do I have to get my face

273
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:06,060
继续贴近你的脸
even closer to yours?

274
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:07,810
为什么你不用这种方法
How come you're not getting

275
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,540
逼问一下我呢
uncomfortably close to my face?

276
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,290
也许这事我也有份
I could be in on it, too.

277
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,870
你觉得可能吗  莉莉
'Course you could, Lil.

278
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,600
我很擅长保守秘密
I can keep a secret.

279
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,980
莉莉  你别逗我了
Lily, don't make me laugh.

280
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,080
你守不住秘密
I'd trust you with a secret

281
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:21,270
就像马修忍不住要吃流行秘密牌爆米花一样
as much as I'd trust Marshall with Pop Secret.

282
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,260
我能守住秘密
I can keep a secret!

283
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:25,390
我非常擅长保守秘密
I can keep a secret real good.

284
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,860
我能把一个秘密保守成高级机密
I can keep a secret like nobody's business,

285
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,740
因为它不关任何人的事
'cause it is nobody's business.

286
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,900
因为它是秘密
'Cause it's a secret,

287
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,650
而我就要保密
and I'm keeping it!

288
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:34,650
马修会自己剃背上的体毛吗
Does Marshall shave his back?

289
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:37,090
不  我帮他剃  该死的
No, I shave it for him. Damn it!

290
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,970
我应该问问马修
I should call Marshall.

291
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,310
他肯定知情
I bet he's in on this.

292
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:43,010
如果他真存在的话
If he really exists.

293
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,820
先不说你要去芝加哥的秘密  
Setting aside the fact that I've kept your whole

294
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,480
我守口如瓶
"Moving to Chicago" thing a secret,

295
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,350
你今晚不是应该打扮成列勃拉斯吗
aren't you supposed to be dressed like Liberace right now?

296
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,700
首先
Okay, first of all,

297
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:56,090
如果我现在就穿成那样
if I showed up in costume,

298
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,880
到时候华丽出场的惊艳感和壮丽感
it would steal from the surprise and spectacle

299
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,240
就没有了
of my grand entrance.

300
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,180
其次  我不干了
And second of all, I'm not doing that.

301
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,170
为什么
Why not?

302
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:05,870
因为打扮成列勃拉斯不难  但是...
Because dressing like Liberace is easy, but...

303
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,650
好的  四四拍  升E调
Uh, yes, 4/4, E-sharp...

304
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,070
主大调...
major...

305
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,690
让我们来演奏一些美妙的音乐吧
Let's make something beautiful, shall we?

306
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:22,680
不如今天就这样吧
I think that's enough for today.

307
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:27,080
我知道这次惊喜的具体安排了
Okay, I figured out how this is gonna go down.

308
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,120
首先  冰块"用完"了
We're gonna "run out" of ice,

309
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,050
罗宾就会叫我出去买
and Robin's gonna ask me to go get some,

310
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:33,670
猜猜怎么样  整个镇上唯一卖冰的地方
and lo and behold, the only place that sells ice

311
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:37,510
隔壁刚好就是当地的激光枪战场
in this whole town is right next to the local laser taggery.

312
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,040
我进去之后...
I go inside and...

313
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,540
惊喜
Surprise!

314
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,650
美味的晚餐  朋友们家人们都在
Beautiful dinner, family and friends,

315
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:45,460
游戏币免费拿  还有越野赛车游戏机
free game tokens and an Off-Road arcade game

316
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,520
被调整过可以无限涡轮加速
that's rigged for unlimited turbos!

317
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,730
这个主意实在是太蠢...
That is the single stupidest...

318
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:49,870
简直难以置信
Guys, you aren't gonna believe this.

319
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,540
制冰机居然坏了
The ice machine is broken.

320
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,680
是吗
Is it now?

321
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:58,610
喵了个咪  居然会这么巧
Well, dog my cats, what are the chances?

322
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,410
所以要怎么办呢
Huh? What do we do?

323
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,480
好吧  我可以去买点冰回来
Well, I guess I could go get some ice.

324
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,710
不用了  他们会派人送的
Uh, no, they'll send someone.

325
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,680
好吧  你强迫我吧  我愿意
All right, fine. Twist my arm. I'll do it.

326
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,700
不过说真的
But seriously, Hmm?

327
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,340
那边真的都准备好了吗
did you get everything set up over there?

328
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,690
食物够吗  枪的数量够吗
Do you have enough food, have enough guns?

329
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:15,000
给斯丁森奶奶备好加大感应衣了吗  她...
Did you get a vest extender for Grandma Stinson? She's...

330
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,360
你到底在说什么啊
What are you talking about?

331
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:20,850
亲爱的  你演技真棒  好爱你
Oh, babe, you're so good at this. I love it.

332
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,360
行了  我们到时候见
All right, I'll see you guys over there.

333
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,950
说错了  我马上回来
I mean, be right back.

334
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,760
巴尼  巴尼  彩排晚宴马上就开始了
Barney, Barney, this is our rehearsal dinner, okay?

335
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,430
不许离开场地
Do not leave the premises.

336
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:31,150
向我保证你不会去其他地方
Promise me you're not going anywhere.

337
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,140
好吧
Fine.

338
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:32,900
说出来
Say it.

339
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,650
说  你保证不会离开
Say you promise you won't leave.

340
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,870
我保证不会离开
I promise I won't leave.

341
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,370
然后我离开了  你知道吗
So I left. And what do you know,

342
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:45,150
卖冰的地方真的在一家激光枪战旁边
the ice store is right next to a laser tag place!

343
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:47,330
完全不是  隔了六英里
No, it isn't! It's six miles away

344
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:48,690
而且还是反方向
he opposite direction.

345
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,580
而且我说了不让你去
And I told you not to go!

346
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,050
可是你还说过
Yeah, well, you also told me

347
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:53,420
婚礼的时候不想要戒熊
didn't want a ring bear at the wedding.

348
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,340
戒童
Ring bear-er!

349
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,900
谁都知道肯定没好结果  重点是
We all know how great that's gonna be. The point is,

350
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,320
我佯装被她骗过了
I played along with her plan,

351
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,540
表现得很"自然"  以免毁掉惊喜
and I acted "natural" so I wouldn't spoil the surprise.

352
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:04,290
法汉普顿激光酒吧

353
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,540
我的天啊
Oh, my goodness!

354
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,170
激光酒吧
Laser tag?!

355
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,330
冰店  六英里外

356
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,210
也许我应该进去一下
Maybe I should go in here for a minute,

357
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:10,700
没什么  就随便看看
just check it out for no apparent reason.

358
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:11,910
这是什么
And what's this?

359
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:14,170
解放双手的游戏币专用包
My hands-free token satchel?

360
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:17,080
还有一辈子免费续杯的啤酒专用杯
And my free lifetime refill root beer mug?

361
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:21,150
所以过去的两个月里
So for the past two months

362
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,430
每个周日晚上
when we were letting you use our apartment

363
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:25,430
我们都会让你用我们的公寓练琴
to practice the piano every Sunday night,

364
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:26,510
你都干什么了
what were you doing?

365
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:30,460
只要是最有价值球员  走步犯规也没事吗
Oh, so that's not traveling 'cause he's the MVP?

366
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,350
拜托
Come on!

367
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,680
巴尼去哪里了  有人看到过他吗
Where's Barney? Has anyone seen him?

368
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,460
罗宾  泰德不打算
Robin, Ted's totally bailing

369
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,490
在婚礼的时候演奏钢琴了
on playing the piano for you and Barney.

370
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:42,940
真的吗  你不用发善心饶过我们的
Oh, really? Ted, you didn't have to not do that.

371
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,280
不过谢谢你
But thank you.

372
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,070
可是他保证过  说话要算数
But he promised! A promise is a promise.

373
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,640
曾经说出的承诺
You can't say you're gonna do something

374
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,490
怎么能说取消就取消
and then suddenly do something completely different!

375
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:53,140
你怎么因为这件事这么激动
Why are you getting so worked up about this?

376
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:56,490
因为我会这样  明显是为了一件
Because, obviously, I'm worked up for a different

377
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:57,760
类似但不一样的事情而激动
but somewhat similar reason.

378
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,390
你们应该问下我的
And someone should ask me about it!

379
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:02,110
抱歉  我现在没时间听你诉苦  莉莉
I'm sorry. I don't have time for your drama right now, Lily.

380
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,600
我的未婚夫不见了
My fiance is missing.

381
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,400
马修接受了法官的工作
Marshall got picked to be a judge.

382
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,590
他没跟我商量就接受了
He took the job without even asking me.

383
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,660
去不成意大利了
Italy's off!

384
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,490
我现在有空听你诉苦了
I have time for your drama.

385
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,530
我还那么努力地学习意大利语
And my Italian was getting so good.

386
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,340
去意大利人的工作我是再见

387
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,080
好多伤心啊

388
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:34,880
等等  你们已经把公寓转租了
But wait, you guys already sublet the apartment.

389
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,420
行李都打包好了
You're already packed.

390
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,930
马修还借走了我的罗塞塔石  结果弄丢了
Marshall already borrowed and lost my Rosetta Stone.

391
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,930
与著名帮助译解了古埃及象形文字石碑的
同名翻译软件

392
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:40,640
自私的混蛋
That selfish bastard!

393
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,230
抱歉莉莉  喂
Sorry, Lil. Hello.

394
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,470
我也很生气
Okay, I'm mad, too.

395
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:45,890
你有理由生气
I should hope so.

396
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:48,430
凭什么他的梦想就比你的梦想重要
All of a sudden, his dream is more important than yours?

397
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:50,180
而且他甚至没跟你商量一下
And he did it behind your back.

398
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,190
太混烂[意大利腔]
Bastardo!

399
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,360
他肯定不是故意伤我心的
He would never hurt me intentionally.

400
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,700
我会故意伤他的
I'll hurt him intentionally.

401
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,260
无耻混蛋
Molto bastardo!

402
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,940
你这样说真是太贴心了
That's sweet of you to say.

403
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:00,000
你这辈子永远不是马修的对手
You could never take Marshall in a million years,

404
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,940
但你这样说太贴心了
but that's sweet of you to say.

405
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:06,000
显然  巴尼去了激光枪战场
Well, apparently, Barney went to the laser tag place

406
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,430
去找惊喜彩排晚宴
looking for a surprise rehearsal dinner.

407
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,240
他没找到  于是威胁
When he didn't find one, he threatened

408
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,410
要把小吃店服务员的脑袋
to dunk the snack bar guy's head

409
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:15,460
扣篮进一桶滚烫的干酪玉米片中
into a vat of scalding nacho Whiz.

410
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:17,760
他被扣留了  等警察来拘捕
He's being held until the police arrive

411
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:20,160
我要来点你的苹果汁
I need your apple juice.

412
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,670
于是我们就到这里了
And here we are.

413
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:29,730
咱们的哑谜游戏玩得够久了
Now, I believe this charade has gone on long enough.

414
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:32,740
直奔主题  开始惊喜激光枪战彩排好吗
Can we please get to the surprise laser tag rehearsal?

415
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,910
根本没有激光枪战彩排晚宴好吗
Hey, there is no surprise laser tag rehearsal dinner!

416
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:39,830
好的  但如果我可以提出相反观点的话
Okay, but if I may offer an opposing view.

417
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,410
当然有啦
Of course there is!

418
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:43,540
这里到处是蛛丝马迹
This place is lousy with clues.

419
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,310
他真的是保安吗
Is he even really a security guard?

420
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:49,840
因为他看起来超级像送三明治
Because he looks an awful lot like a non-Pakistani version

421
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,580
到我公司的非巴基斯坦外卖小子
of the guy who delivers sandwiches at my office.

422
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:53,780
还有
Also...

423
00:14:55,610 --> 00:15:01,160
"激光枪战"单词的字母个数和"彩排"一样
"Laser tag" has the same number of letters as "rehearsal."

424
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,330
"激光游戏"有8个字母  "彩排"有9个
Laser tag has eight, rehearsal has nine.

425
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:09,150
如果把这些字母重新排序  再加点别的字母
And if you rearrange the letters and add some other ones,

426
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:13,660
就是  "准备好  巴尼  迎接史上最大的惊喜
it says, "Get ready, Barney, for the biggest surprise ever,

427
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,960
你这个帅气的小..."
you handsome son of a..."

428
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,940
没有足够字母拼写"杂种"了
and then not quite enough letters for "bitch,"

429
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,170
但做得好  罗宾
but good try, Robin.

430
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:21,260
这太疯狂了  巴尼
This is crazy, Barney.

431
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,030
我们不能这样维持婚姻
We-We can't have a marriage like this.

432
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:27,790
婚姻应该以诚实和信任为基础
A marriage has to be built on honesty and trust

433
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,910
还有那些莉莉马修夫妻之道的废话
and all of that Lily- and-Marshall crap.

434
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:33,240
我以为我们的婚姻是以诚实和信任为基础的
I though our marriage was built on honesty and trust

435
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,370
还有那些莉莉马修夫妻之道的废话
and all that Lily- and-Marshal crap.

436
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:39,500
我现在感觉好孤单
I just feel so alone right now.

437
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:42,220
你不孤单  我在这里
Well, you're not. I'm here.

438
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,830
我知道你可以保守秘密
And I know you can keep a secret.

439
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,540
是啊
Yeah, right.

440
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,460
这样吧
Tell you what.

441
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,620
我再向你透露个秘密如何
How about I let you in on another secret?

442
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,520
非常大的秘密
Something bigger.

443
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,440
比芝加哥的事还大吗
Bigger than Chicago?

444
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,010
你不是开玩笑吧
Are you kidding?

445
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:03,400
不  想来宣布这件事吗
Nope. Want to do the honors?

446
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,360
女士们先生们
Ladies and gentlemen,

447
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,570
计划稍稍有变
there's been a slight change of plan.

448
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,600
好吧  好吧
Fine! Fine.

449
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,380
你是对的  罗宾
You're right, Robin.

450
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:18,200
婚姻的重点不是玩疯狂的恶作剧
Marriage isn't about playing crazy pranks.

451
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:21,210
也不是说些精心策划的专家级长篇谎言
It isn't about telling long expertly crafted lies

452
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,200
来掩护这些恶作剧
to cover those pranks...

453
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,470
你是怎么解开手铐的
How'd you get out of those handcuffs?

454
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:26,180
不是雇演员扮演保安
...and hiring actors to play security guards

455
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,450
也不是砸下大笔银子去做
and spending exorbitant amounts of money on things

456
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,480
巨大的假激光枪战标志
like giant, fake laser tag signs.

457
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,580
不  重点是诚实
No, it's about honesty.

458
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,690
你穿六号冰鞋对吗
Size six skate, right?

459
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,000
是的
Yeah.

460
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:39,410
本着这种精神  我得说实话
And in that spirit, I got to be honest.

461
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:41,840
以后时不时地
Every now and then,

462
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:45,560
我会对你说谎  我就是这样
I am gonna lie to you. I just am.

463
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:49,870
哪怕是为了给你美妙的惊喜  我也会说谎
If it's in the interest of an amazing surprise, that is.

464
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:54,160
你会被愚弄  蒙蔽
You're gonna get bamboozled, hoodwinked.

465
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,120
见鬼  我就直说了吧
Heck, I'll just say it.

466
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,720
雪花会飘落在你身上
You're gonna get snowed.

467
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,260
这里为什么会下雪
Why is it snowing in here?

468
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,090
穿上冰鞋吧
Put on the skates.

469
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:04,820
我们得走了
We gotta go.

470
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,240
去哪里
Where?

471
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:08,620
我们去哪里
Where are we going?

472
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,390
参加彩排晚宴  小傻瓜
To the rehearsal dinner, silly.

473
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,810
咱们让派对开始吧
Let's get this party started.

474
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,290
什么
What?!

475
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:22,420
惊喜
Surprise!

476
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,190
这是怎么回事
What-What is going on?

477
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,350
我知道这周末你有多想回加拿大
I know how much you wanted to be in Canada this weekend.

478
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,530
所以我把加拿大带到你身边
So I brought Canada to you.

479
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:35,020
这是韦恩・格雷茨基的签名照
Oh, and here's an autographed picture of Wayne Gretzky.

480
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:35,920
谢谢
Thanks.

481
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,190
这个家伙不是保安
And this guy's not really a security guard.

482
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:47,900
曾经有一个男孩 *
* Once there was this boy who

483
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:53,370
西装不离身  "传奇"不离口 *
* Wore a lot of suits and said that stuff was "Legendary"

484
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:58,170
他与人击掌无数 *
* He gave lots of high fives

485
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,840
而且发誓 *
* And swore...

486
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:05,390
他永远不会结婚 *
* That he would never get married

487
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,520
他真的觉得他是认真的 *
* He really thought he meant it

488
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,250
谢谢你让我参与这个秘密
Thanks for letting me in on this.

489
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,280
哪怕是在最后一刻
Even if it was at the very end.

490
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,300
我的荣幸
My pleasure.

491
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,520
对了
Oh, and by the way,

492
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,880
我还有一个秘密没说
there's one more secret I've been keeping.

493
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:20,680
我应该上钢琴课的那些晚上
All those nights I was supposed to be taking piano lessons?

494
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:25,740
其实我在上花样滑冰课
I was actually taking figure skating lessons!

495
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,100
<i>孩子们  要想学会花样滑冰</i>
<i>Kids, it takes more than two months</i>

496
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,810
<i>两个月是不够的</i>
<i>to learn how to figure skate.</i>

497
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:37,480
我爱你
I love you.

498
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,220
我也爱你
I love you, too.

499
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:41,990
-我会还以颜色的  -放马过来
- I'm gonna get you back, you know? - Bring it.

500
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:48,520
并且  她也发誓永远不会结婚 *
* And swore she'd also never get married

501
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,870
她真的觉得她是认真的 *
* She really thought she meant it.

502
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,260
真不敢相信这些是你安排的
I can't believe you did all of this.

503
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,000
我以为你不喜欢加拿大
Hey, I thought you didn't like Canada.

504
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,960
开什么玩笑  我爱加拿大
Are you kidding? I love Canada.

505
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,660
我滴个亲娘
Holy musk ox,

506
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:08,870
那不是加拿大传奇医生弗雷德里克・班廷吗
isn't that legendary Canadian Dr. Frederick Banting

507
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,910
1924年  我发现了胰岛素
In 1924, I discovered insulin.

508
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,600
受死吧  糖尿病
Take that, diabetes.

509
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,620
看  这是马尼托巴省的当地人诺曼・布瑞奇
Hey, look, it's Manitoba's native son, Norman Breakey.

510
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,770
不用谢  全世界
You're welcome, world.

511
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:20,520
享受我的发明吧  滚漆筒
Enjoy my invention, the paint roller.

512
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:23,850
当然了  你认识艾伦・锡克
And of course, you know Alan Thicke.

513
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,930
瞧你
Hey, hey, you...

514
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:27,680
这里最美丽的女孩
...are the prettiest girl in the place.

515
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,180
谢谢你  艾伦
Oh, thank you, Alan.

516
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,210
行啦  行啦
All right, all right, all right.

517
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:30,830
见到你真开心
Good to see you.

518
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,210
看  这是路易丝・普瓦里耶
Hey, look, it's Louise Poirier,

519
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:33,320
我想她效力的公司
who I think worked for the company

520
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,480
可能发明了神奇文胸
that probably created Wonderbra.

521
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,380
再见啦  旧式束身衣

522
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,610
别蹭了  行啦  行啦
Let go, okay, okay.

523
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,520
加拿大还帮手打赢了两次世界大战
Canadians also helped win two world wars...

524
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,730
为全世界奉献了尼尔・杨  威廉・夏特纳
...and gave the world Neil Young, William Shatner,

525
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,730

四分之一的巴尼・斯丁森
one quarter of Barney Stinson,

529
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,640
即食土豆泥  当然最好的作品  就是你
instant mashed potatoes, and best of all, you.

530
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,300
谢谢
Thank you.
