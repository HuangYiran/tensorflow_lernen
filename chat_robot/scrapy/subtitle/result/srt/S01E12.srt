1
00:00:14,299 --> 00:00:16,384
放松一点, 操作时别那么紧张
Ease up on the controls a little.

2
00:00:16,468 --> 00:00:17,469
我很好
I'm fine.

3
00:00:17,511 --> 00:00:19,804
你要把那该死的东西拔下来了, 放松一点
You're going to snap the damn things off. Ease up.

4
00:00:19,846 --> 00:00:21,765
我只是想看看这个baby能做些什么
I'm justy seeing what this baby can do.

5
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,600
你刚才叫它"baby"?
Did you just say "this baby"?

6
00:00:23,642 --> 00:00:25,644
这非常接近宇航员们的说法
It's perfectly appropriate space pilot parlance.

7
00:00:25,685 --> 00:00:27,854
尽量把这个"baby"沿直线飞行
Just try to fly the baby in a straight line.

8
00:00:27,896 --> 00:00:29,564
我是沿直线飞行来着
I'm flying in a straight line.

9
00:00:34,653 --> 00:00:35,987
不完全是
Not so much.

10
00:00:36,029 --> 00:00:38,823
好吧, 在太空中, 所有的运动都是相关的
Well, in space, all motion is relative.

11
00:00:45,247 --> 00:00:47,040
你还好吧, Gall博士?
You okay, Dr. Gall?

12
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:50,502
我有点晕, 只要是在动的东西里面
I get motion sickness.

13
00:00:51,294 --> 00:00:53,296
这些东西有惯性阻尼器
These things have inertial dampeners.

14
00:00:53,338 --> 00:00:54,673
你不应该会觉察到移动的
You shouldn't feel a thing.

15
00:00:54,756 --> 00:00:56,675
我...我知道我们在动
I...I know we're moving.

16
00:00:56,758 --> 00:00:58,301
这对我来说已经足够了
That's enough for me.

17
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:03,515
我为什么选这个人来执行任务?
Why'd you choose this guy for the mission?

18
00:01:03,849 --> 00:01:06,643
是Brendan发现了那个处于拉格朗日点的卫星
Brendan's the one who discovered
the lagrangian point satellite was out here.

19
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,229
Elizabeth认为只有他可以找到它
Elizabeth felt he should see it for himself.

20
00:01:09,354 --> 00:01:10,814
不要放开操作杆!
Don't let go of the controls!

21
00:01:10,856 --> 00:01:12,190
不需要一直抓住吧!
Snapping doesn't help!

22
00:01:12,691 --> 00:01:15,277
这就是为什么父母亲总是请别人来教他们的孩子如何驾驶
This is why parents get someone else
to teach their kids how to drive.

23
00:01:15,318 --> 00:01:17,445
嗨, 你这句话真是让我又受伤又感动
Hey, I'm both insulted and touched by that.

24
00:01:21,533 --> 00:01:23,243
噢, 我的天哪
Oh, my god.

25
00:01:41,011 --> 00:01:42,053
McKay...
McKay...

26
00:01:42,095 --> 00:01:43,346
是的, 是的, 当然, 请吧
Yes, yes, of course, please.

27
00:01:50,854 --> 00:01:53,523
在距离1000米远的地方停住
Holding station at 1,000 meters.

28
00:01:53,607 --> 00:01:56,401
我们差不多在半英里远的地方
然后它却充满了整个挡风玻璃, 这个东西真是大啊
We're almost a half a mile away and it's
filling the windshield. This thing is enormous.

29
00:01:56,484 --> 00:01:58,862
它有Goa'uld母舰那么大了
It's as large as a Goa'uld mothership.

30
00:01:58,945 --> 00:02:01,907
这可能是独立武器平台中最大的了
This might be the single largest
weapons platform ever constructed.

31
00:02:02,073 --> 00:02:04,451
这可能是古人在Atlantis之前的最后防线了
It's probably the ancients' last line
of defense before Atlantis.

32
00:02:04,576 --> 00:02:08,371
它还有可能在运转起来么?
这可是一个非常好的东西
Any chance it's still operational?
Because that would be a very good thing.

33
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:11,041
你那有没有得到能量读数?
Are you getting any energy readings?

34
00:02:11,249 --> 00:02:12,292
没有
Negative.

35
00:02:12,501 --> 00:02:13,960
就是说这玩意儿死了?
So it's dead?

36
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:18,089
好吧, 这需要进一步深入调查, 不过现在可以这么说
Well, it warrants closer scrutiny, but yeah.

37
00:02:18,256 --> 00:02:20,550
在古人们最后一次防守中被攻破了?
Knocked out during the ancients' last stand?

38
00:02:20,675 --> 00:02:23,386
要么它的能源用完了
一万年可不短啊
Or its power source is depleted.
10,000 years is a long time.

39
00:02:23,428 --> 00:02:25,680
- 我们需要靠近去看看...
- 等等
- We should still take a closer look...
- Wait, wait.

40
00:02:26,264 --> 00:02:28,475
我在超低频段收到一些信号
I'm getting something in the ultra-low frequency range.

41
00:02:34,731 --> 00:02:35,982
从哪里来的?
Where's it coming from?

42
00:02:38,985 --> 00:02:40,654
这个行星
The planet.

43
00:02:42,197 --> 00:02:43,657
这是一个求救信号...
It's a distress call...

44
00:02:45,158 --> 00:02:47,327
幽灵的求救信号
A Wraith distress call.

45
00:03:46,545 --> 00:03:52,675
星际之门之亚特兰蒂斯
第一季第12集 抵抗
Season 1 : Episode 12 The Defiant One

46
00:04:01,735 --> 00:04:02,944
你确定是幽灵么?
You're sure it's Wraith?

47
00:04:02,986 --> 00:04:04,196
在这个太阳系中?
In this solar system?

48
00:04:04,237 --> 00:04:05,864
更简单的说, 它就在我们的后院
I know. Celestially speaking,
it's right in our backyard.

49
00:04:06,323 --> 00:04:09,117
我认为是古人的卫星把幽灵的飞船击落了
We figure the ancient satellite
shot the Wraith ship down

50
00:04:09,242 --> 00:04:11,077
在保卫Atlantis的最后战斗中
in the final battle for Atlantis.

51
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:13,663
而它在几千年后仍然在发出信号?
And it's still putting out a signal
after thousands of years?

52
00:04:13,747 --> 00:04:14,873
非常微弱的信号
It's a very weak signal.

53
00:04:14,956 --> 00:04:16,917
听我说, 如果这艘飞船的还有部分仍然保持完好
Look, if any part of that ship is intact,

54
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,211
那就还有科学上和军事上的研究价值
the wealth of scientific and military knowledge

55
00:04:19,336 --> 00:04:20,837
这种价值是无法估量的
we could acquire is invaluable.

56
00:04:21,254 --> 00:04:22,547
那么你的意思是?
So what are you saying?

57
00:04:22,756 --> 00:04:24,216
我们必须下去瞧瞧
We have to go down and take a look.

58
00:04:24,257 --> 00:04:25,383
必须去?
You have to?

59
00:04:25,926 --> 00:04:28,762
你们花了15个小时才到达那里
It took you almost 15 hours to get there.

60
00:04:29,763 --> 00:04:31,890
好吧, 另外一个我们必须去看看的原因是
Well, all the more reason we should have a look.

61
00:04:31,932 --> 00:04:32,974
我们已经在这里了
We're already here.

62
00:04:33,016 --> 00:04:36,645
我必须提醒的是这个行星的大气层已经极度电离化了
I should mention that the planet's
atmosphere is extremely ionized.

63
00:04:36,686 --> 00:04:38,980
无线电通信将会非常困难
Radio communication could be difficult.

64
00:04:39,314 --> 00:04:43,318
即使我们派出救援
也要花15小时才能赶到这里
And it would take at least 15 hours
to send out any sort of rescue.

65
00:04:43,777 --> 00:04:44,778
我们会没事的
We'll be fine.

66
00:04:44,986 --> 00:04:46,112
少校?
Major?

67
00:04:46,821 --> 00:04:48,281
我同意McKay
I agree with McKay.

68
00:04:49,032 --> 00:04:49,950
你当然同意
Of course you do.

69
00:04:49,991 --> 00:04:53,119
你们当中有谁会放弃探索一个坠毁的外星飞船的机会呢?
How could either of you resist exploring
a crashed alien spaceship?

70
00:04:53,411 --> 00:04:54,204
很对
Exactly.

71
00:04:54,329 --> 00:04:57,040
我向你保证, 这些兴趣完全
是为了我们的工作, Elizabeth.
I assure you, our interest
is purely professional, Elizabeth.

72
00:04:57,123 --> 00:05:00,043
认真的说, 我们可以从他们的武器系统中
得到不少东西...
Seriously, the amount of intel we could
gather from their weapons system...

73
00:05:00,085 --> 00:05:01,419
密码, 防护罩...
Codes, shields...

74
00:05:01,503 --> 00:05:02,504
好吧
All right.

75
00:05:02,546 --> 00:05:04,798
那一定要非常小心
Proceed with extreme caution, please,

76
00:05:04,881 --> 00:05:06,550
三小时之内要跟我联系
and check in with me in three hours.

77
00:05:06,591 --> 00:05:08,760
- 三小时? 太短了点吧...
- 没问题
- Three hours? That's hardly enough time...
- Will do.

78
00:05:09,135 --> 00:05:10,345
探索者1号出发
Jumper one out.

79
00:05:16,351 --> 00:05:18,478
"无线电通信会非常困难"
"Radio communication could be difficult."

80
00:05:18,603 --> 00:05:20,146
嗨, 她同意了, 不是么?
Hey, she said yes, didn't she?

81
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,481
这不是你的功劳
And no thanks to you.

82
00:05:21,648 --> 00:05:23,650
好吧, 你们可以停一下了, 伙计们
All right, knock it off, guys.

83
00:05:23,775 --> 00:05:26,486
我花了15个小时听你们两个唠叨
I've spent the last 15 hours listening to you two.

84
00:05:31,575 --> 00:05:32,993
准备好了么?
Are we ready?

85
00:05:36,746 --> 00:05:38,665
好吧, 记住我们降落的位置
All right, let's remember where we parked.

86
00:05:44,671 --> 00:05:46,423
我们为什么不降落在飞船附近?
Why didn't we just land next to the ship?

87
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:47,799
以防万一
Just a precaution.

88
00:05:48,008 --> 00:05:51,136
万一什么?
现在离它坠毁已经有几千年了
A precaution for what?
The Wraith ship crashed thousands of years ago.

89
00:05:51,178 --> 00:05:52,762
自动防御
Automated defenses.

90
00:05:53,263 --> 00:05:54,723
我从来没有想过
I never thought of that.

91
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:55,891
没事, Brendan.
Don't worry, Brendan.

92
00:05:56,016 --> 00:05:58,393
我们研究的领域不同
We weren't all built for field work.

93
00:05:58,685 --> 00:06:00,353
我们快到了, 是么?
Seriously, we're almost there, right?

94
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,482
这是什么?
What's that?

95
00:06:07,194 --> 00:06:08,653
某种虫子?
Some kind of bug?

96
00:06:08,987 --> 00:06:10,447
太空虫
Space bug.

97
00:06:11,573 --> 00:06:13,617
它正在发出某种相当强烈的生命信号
It's giving off
some pretty strong life-signs readings.

98
00:06:13,783 --> 00:06:16,536
啊, 我想我对蜜蜂之类的东西比较过敏
Uh, okay, did I mention
how allergic I was to bee stings?

99
00:06:16,661 --> 00:06:17,996
可能它闻到了食物的味道
Maybe it smells the food.

100
00:06:18,121 --> 00:06:20,332
也许它刚刚闻到了少女的恐惧
Maybe he's just smelling the girlish fear.

101
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,921
好吧, 我们别管它, 它也不会理我们的
Well, let's leave it be, and it'll leave us be.

102
00:06:29,883 --> 00:06:30,717
伙计们...
Guys...

103
00:06:49,694 --> 00:06:51,446
你们以前看过类似的东西么?
Have you seen one like this before?

104
00:06:51,613 --> 00:06:53,490
它太小了, 不可能是幽灵们群居的那种飞船
It's too small to be a hive ship.

105
00:06:54,658 --> 00:06:56,284
它在这儿已经很久了
Well, it's been here for a very long time.

106
00:06:56,409 --> 00:06:58,119
也许他们放弃了那种模式
Maybe they've discontinued that model.

107
00:06:58,203 --> 00:07:02,249
可能吧, 不管它是什么, 这看起来像是地狱
Maybe, but whatever it is, it took a hell of a hit.

108
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,043
被古人卫星击落的那个
Score one for the ancient satellite.

109
00:07:09,297 --> 00:07:11,466
那里仍然有一些骨架
There's still some skeletons down there.

110
00:07:11,633 --> 00:07:13,510
我猜坠落后可能有人还活着
I guess everyone didn't die in the crash.

111
00:07:13,552 --> 00:07:15,136
有任何生命的迹象么?
Are you getting any life signs?

112
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,680
我想我们没必要害怕
I think we can rule that out.

113
00:07:16,721 --> 00:07:18,348
这只是以防万一
It's just a precaution.

114
00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:20,141
好吧
Fine.

115
00:07:24,855 --> 00:07:27,232
没有, 只有我们和那些发光的虫子
飞船那儿什么都没有
No, it's just us and the glowy bugs.
Nothing coming from the ship.

116
00:07:27,274 --> 00:07:28,275
好的
Good.

117
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,360
我们去瞧瞧吧
Let's go take a look.

118
00:07:48,712 --> 00:07:50,380
我收到了微弱的能量信号
I'm picking up faint power readings.

119
00:07:51,631 --> 00:07:54,718
肯定有东西在为发射求救信号的装置提供能量
Something had to be powering the distress beacon.

120
00:08:12,402 --> 00:08:13,737
来吧, Abrams.
Come on, Abrams.

121
00:08:14,362 --> 00:08:16,406
也许我们应该派个人守在外面
Maybe one of us should stay outside.

122
00:08:18,325 --> 00:08:19,784
好吧, 我知道你是怎么想的
Look, I know how you feel,

123
00:08:19,951 --> 00:08:22,454
但是这种机会我们以后还会有么?
but how many opportunities like this
are we going to get?

124
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:58,490
看起来这个家伙好像刚刚才死去
This guy looks like he just lied there and died.

125
00:08:58,615 --> 00:09:00,116
它被保存得很好
It's remarkably preserved.

126
00:09:00,158 --> 00:09:02,035
要么就是它确实是不久前才死
Or it wasn't that long ago.

127
00:09:03,078 --> 00:09:04,162
好吧
All right.

128
00:09:04,829 --> 00:09:06,706
Beckett需要一些样本
Beckett will want samples.

129
00:09:15,048 --> 00:09:16,132
谁来...?
It is...?

130
00:09:16,883 --> 00:09:17,634
好吧
Yeah.

131
00:09:21,513 --> 00:09:22,472
OK...
Okay...

132
00:09:27,143 --> 00:09:29,437
这到底是...?
What the...?

133
00:09:30,021 --> 00:09:31,064
OK
Okay.

134
00:09:32,065 --> 00:09:33,525
这和往常不同
This is different.

135
00:09:34,317 --> 00:09:35,735
幽灵嗜食同类?
Wraith cannibalism?

136
00:09:35,777 --> 00:09:37,112
看起来是
Looks like it.

137
00:09:37,237 --> 00:09:38,405
他们自相残杀?
They feed off each other?

138
00:09:38,488 --> 00:09:40,282
这可能是最后的手段
Probably as a last resort.

139
00:09:40,323 --> 00:09:42,993
我猜它们当中有人试图尽可能的活得久些
I guess some of them tried
to survive as long as possible.

140
00:09:43,118 --> 00:09:44,995
好吧, 这真是难以置信
Okay, that is incredibly disturbing.

141
00:09:45,287 --> 00:09:46,580
别开玩笑了
No kidding.

142
00:09:48,498 --> 00:09:50,000
我想, 如果有...
You know, I wonder if there's...

143
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:50,917
伙计们!
Guys!

144
00:10:08,977 --> 00:10:11,354
这是尸体, 人类的尸体
They're bodies, human bodies.

145
00:10:13,023 --> 00:10:15,233
在他们群居的飞船也有类似的房间
They have chambers like this on hive ships.

146
00:10:16,109 --> 00:10:18,195
但我以前从来没有见过这么大的
I've never seen one so large before.

147
00:10:18,945 --> 00:10:20,113
我不明白
I don't understand.

148
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,531
幽灵把人封到茧中
The Wraith cocoon humans.

149
00:10:21,573 --> 00:10:25,118
让他们的身体停止活动
这样将来就可以...
They keep their bodies in a sort of
suspended animation, so later they can...

150
00:10:26,995 --> 00:10:29,581
我想我们已经知道了这艘船是干什么的了
I think we just figured out what this ship was for.

151
00:10:30,165 --> 00:10:31,666
这是一艘补给船...
It's a supply ship...

152
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:34,169
给围困Atlantis的幽灵们补给食物
On its way to feed the Wraith who
were laying siege to Atlantis.

153
00:10:34,461 --> 00:10:35,754
这太恐怖了
Well, that's terrifying.

154
00:10:35,837 --> 00:10:38,381
Gall, Abrams, 检查一下, 要小心
Gall, Abrams, check it out, but be careful.

155
00:10:38,423 --> 00:10:39,633
什么? 不, 等等
What? No, wait.

156
00:10:39,674 --> 00:10:40,795
你要去哪儿?
Where are you going?

157
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,428
好吧, 这艘船应该有驾驶台
也许可以在那找到些有用的东西
Well, the ship's got to have a bridge.
Maybe we can get some useful intel.

158
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,055
也就是说你要把我们留在这里?
So you're just leaving us here?

159
00:10:45,096 --> 00:10:46,598
有什么问题么? 他们都死了
What's the problem? They're all dead.

160
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,557
这就是问题!
That's the problem!

161
00:10:47,682 --> 00:10:50,060
就是用DV拍拍, 然后粗略数数人数
Just get some D.V. and a rough head count.

162
00:10:50,101 --> 00:10:51,770
我们仍然可以用无线电联系
We'll stay in radio contact.

163
00:10:52,437 --> 00:10:55,357
那可能会比较困难
飞船的这部分好像真的有屏蔽作用
That could be difficult.
This part of the ship seems really shielded.

164
00:10:55,398 --> 00:10:56,858
Weir只给了我们几个小时
Weir only gave us a few hours.

165
00:10:56,942 --> 00:10:58,652
我们每隔几分钟就联系一次
We'll check in every few minutes.

166
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,362
你不是想在某个领域研究么
You wanted field work.

167
00:11:01,363 --> 00:11:03,031
这... 就是你要研究的
This... Is field work.

168
00:11:21,258 --> 00:11:24,886
中尉, 我想让你带一队人待命
准备救援
Lieutenant, I'd like you to put a team
on standby for a rescue mission.

169
00:11:24,928 --> 00:11:26,012
少校出了什么问题么?
Is the major all right?

170
00:11:26,096 --> 00:11:27,347
一切都好, 我保证
I'm sure everything's fine.

171
00:11:27,472 --> 00:11:28,807
我只是想有一队人准备着
I'd just like to have a team ready.

172
00:11:29,891 --> 00:11:31,184
这就是说, 以防万一?
So just in case?

173
00:11:31,476 --> 00:11:33,770
是的, 以防万一
Yeah. Just in case.

174
00:11:35,188 --> 00:11:36,231
遵命
Yes, ma'am.

175
00:11:43,488 --> 00:11:45,991
在E.M.频谱我没有收到任何信号
I'm not picking up anything in the E.M. spectrum.

176
00:11:47,784 --> 00:11:49,744
我本应该再带上一份能源
I may need to rig up a secondary power source

177
00:11:49,828 --> 00:11:52,205
这样我们就可以接入他们的计算机系统
so we can interface with their computer systems.

178
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,957
我现在只是想知道...
I'm just thinking out loud here...

179
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,958
什么?
What?

180
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:58,879
如果有刚才发现的那些人提供食物
一个幽灵最多可以活多久?
How long do you think a Wraith could feed
on all those humans back there?

181
00:11:58,962 --> 00:12:01,214
嗯, 在某些时候他们可以冬眠几百年
Well, they're capable of hibernating
for hundreds of years at a time,

182
00:12:01,298 --> 00:12:02,757
但是, 我的意思是, 你想想
but, I mean, think about it.

183
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:06,219
一万年前人类文明才刚刚开始
10,000 years ago was roughly
the dawn of human civilization.

184
00:12:06,344 --> 00:12:07,554
那, 它们有没有机会...
So there's no chance...

185
00:12:07,554 --> 00:12:08,972
不会, 不会, 不会
你在开玩笑?
No, no, no. Are you kidding?

186
00:12:09,055 --> 00:12:11,516
噢, 也有可能
Well... Maybe.

187
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,644
McKay
McKay.

188
00:12:15,187 --> 00:12:16,062
不
No.

189
00:12:16,271 --> 00:12:18,732
不, 在这种情况下没有生命可以活这么久
No, no living thing could survive
that long under those conditions.

190
00:12:18,773 --> 00:12:20,066
这是荒谬的
It's ridiculous.

191
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:24,362
好吧
Okay.

192
00:12:24,863 --> 00:12:27,741
那需要一个不可思议的能源
在整个这段时间内
That would require an incredible
power source capable of sustaining

193
00:12:27,782 --> 00:12:30,660
将贮存的人类维持在僵化状态
the stored humans in suspended
animation almost the entire time.

194
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,830
那就是说这是可能的了?
So it's possible?

195
00:12:34,206 --> 00:12:35,832
噢, 天哪. 这确实是可能的
Oh, my god. It is possible.

196
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:39,419
我们要快点离开这里
We've got to get out of here.

197
00:12:42,756 --> 00:12:44,257
Gall, Abrams, 我是Sheppard.
Gall, Abrams, this is Sheppard.

198
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,470
少校, 你想吓死我么?
Major, are you trying to scare me to death?

199
00:12:48,762 --> 00:12:51,181
我可能有些过于谨慎
但我们需要...
I'm probably being
a little overcautious, but we need to...

200
00:12:53,683 --> 00:12:54,893
我们要做什么?
We need to what?

201
00:12:55,352 --> 00:12:57,771
少校, 再说一次
刚才你的信号中断了
Major, say again. Your radio's breaking up.

202
00:12:57,979 --> 00:12:59,898
我们撤回到入口处
Let's fall back to our point of ingress.

203
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,816
然后回到我们的飞船
We're headed back to the jumper.

204
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,780
我想我们需要离开这里
I think we're getting out of here.

205
00:13:09,115 --> 00:13:10,951
我想我看到了什么, 在你身后的走廊上
I just saw something in the corridor behind you.

206
00:13:10,992 --> 00:13:12,077
我们不能从那边走
We can't go that way.

207
00:13:12,118 --> 00:13:13,578
少校, 我刚才看到了什么
Major, I just saw something.

208
00:13:15,705 --> 00:13:16,957
好吧, 别动
All right, stay put.

209
00:13:16,998 --> 00:13:18,458
我们就过来
We're coming back to you.

210
00:13:19,751 --> 00:13:20,794
收到
Understood.

211
00:13:21,753 --> 00:13:22,838
这儿什么都没有
There's nothing out here.

212
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:24,297
Brendan, 那只是你的错觉
Brendan, you're just freaking out on me.

213
00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:25,841
我跟你说, 我确实看见了
I'm telling you, I saw something.

214
00:13:25,882 --> 00:13:27,259
把那东西拿开, 你会杀了我的
Put that thing away. You're going to kill somebody.

215
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,468
我知道我看到了什么!
I know what I saw!

216
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,473
噢, 天哪
Oh, my god.

217
00:13:50,365 --> 00:13:51,449
这边
This way.

218
00:14:26,359 --> 00:14:27,777
他死了
He is dead.

219
00:14:27,861 --> 00:14:29,112
Gall在哪?
Where's Gall?

220
00:14:29,237 --> 00:14:30,238
不知道
I don't know.

221
00:14:31,573 --> 00:14:32,991
Gall, 我是Sheppard. 回话
Gall, this is Sheppard. Come in.

222
00:14:33,074 --> 00:14:34,868
它肯定把他带走了
It must have taken him.

223
00:14:38,747 --> 00:14:40,373
你是对的 他们正在动
You're right. They're on the move.

224
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,376
我想干什么?
What're you doing?

225
00:14:43,418 --> 00:14:45,337
带上他的武器和弹药, 拿着
Taking his weapons andd his ammo. Here.

226
00:14:45,378 --> 00:14:47,464
- 我已经有支枪了
- 现在你有两支了
- I already have a gun.
- Now you have two.

227
00:14:49,341 --> 00:14:50,926
你不是想去追那个幽灵吧?
You're not planning on going after the Wraith?

228
00:14:51,092 --> 00:14:54,054
我想救出gall, 然后离开这个该死的地方
I plan on going after gall,
then I plan on getting the hell out of here.

229
00:14:55,096 --> 00:14:57,474
在我检查的时候, 这里根本就没有生命信号
There was nothing alive when I scanned for life signs.

230
00:14:57,641 --> 00:15:00,018
在它们冬眠的时候, 是不会显示生命信号的
They don't show up as life signs
when they're hibernating.

231
00:15:03,313 --> 00:15:05,524
好吧. 我们走
Okay. Let's go.

232
00:15:31,842 --> 00:15:32,884
求求你!
Please!

233
00:15:44,354 --> 00:15:45,814
他们从不会迟到的
They're not even overdue yet.

234
00:15:45,856 --> 00:15:47,107
这不重要
It doesn't matter.

235
00:15:47,148 --> 00:15:50,527
把这称作直觉, 或者偏执
或者我们可以把这当作是一个训练
Call it intuition, paranoia,
or we can just call it a drill.

236
00:15:50,652 --> 00:15:52,153
无论如何, 我希望你们马上出发
Either way, I want you to go now.

237
00:15:52,195 --> 00:15:54,656
我们随时可以被召回
如果他们真的是碰上了麻烦...
We can always be called back,
but if they are in trouble...

238
00:15:54,739 --> 00:15:56,908
那我们就不要浪费时间了
- Then every moment counts.
- Exactly.

239
00:15:57,242 --> 00:15:58,201
Ford, 你的驾驶员是谁?
Ford, who's your pilot?

240
00:15:58,243 --> 00:15:59,077
Markham
Markham.

241
00:15:59,119 --> 00:16:01,204
好的, 他可以进行一些驾驶练习
Good, he could use some piloting practice.

242
00:16:01,246 --> 00:16:03,373
我已经准备了大量的军火, 足以进行一场小型战争了
And I've packed enough ordnance to fight a small war.

243
00:16:03,456 --> 00:16:04,833
希望最好不要这样
Let's hope you don't have to.

244
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:05,959
遵命
Yes, ma'am.

245
00:16:07,669 --> 00:16:08,920
我们出发吧
Let's move out.

246
00:16:22,601 --> 00:16:23,643
那是什么?
What's that?

247
00:16:24,311 --> 00:16:26,980
不知道, 但我想我没有带够弹药
I don't know, but I don't have
the ordnance I should have,

248
00:16:27,063 --> 00:16:28,523
杀死那些人要用掉大量的弹药
and it takes a lot to kill these guys.

249
00:16:28,565 --> 00:16:30,233
我要尽可能的多带些
I'll take any edge I can get.

250
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:38,033
你是从哪个星球来的?
What world are you from?

251
00:16:38,867 --> 00:16:40,535
无论如何...你还是会杀了我的
Y-you're going to kill me anyway.

252
00:16:41,578 --> 00:16:44,956
你是坐飞船过来的
You have come here by ship.

253
00:16:45,081 --> 00:16:46,875
飞船在哪儿?
Where is it?

254
00:16:47,292 --> 00:16:49,169
我说了你也会杀了我的
You're going to kill me anyway.

255
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:55,759
但我可以慢慢来
But not all at once.

256
00:17:01,848 --> 00:17:04,768
好...待在我身后
Okay... Stay behind me.

257
00:17:04,851 --> 00:17:06,520
除非我叫你, 千万别开火
Shoot only when I tell you to shoot.

258
00:17:42,848 --> 00:17:44,307
他离开了飞船
He's left the ship.

259
00:17:51,189 --> 00:17:52,399
它杀了Abrams.
It killed Abrams.

260
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,692
我们知道
We know.

261
00:17:55,485 --> 00:17:57,028
它太快了...
It was so fast...

262
00:17:57,279 --> 00:17:58,738
它还从我身上取食
It fed off me.

263
00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:59,781
你会好起来的
You're going to be all right.

264
00:17:59,823 --> 00:18:01,116
当时它正在夺走我的生命
It was taking my life.

265
00:18:01,157 --> 00:18:02,158
我可以感觉得到...
I could feel it...

266
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,327
好了, 好了, 好了
听我说, 听我说
All right, all right, all right.
Listen to me. Listen to me.

267
00:18:04,411 --> 00:18:05,662
你仍然还活着
You're still here.

268
00:18:07,455 --> 00:18:08,707
你能动么?
Can you move?

269
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,918
肩膀下面都动不了了
Nothing below my shoulders.

270
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:13,837
我想麻痹只是暂时的
I'm sure the paralysis is just temporary.

271
00:18:13,879 --> 00:18:15,297
几小时后, 你就会好起来的
You'll be all right in a few hours.

272
00:18:15,338 --> 00:18:17,507
我把我们飞船所在的方位告诉它了
I told him where we left the jumper.

273
00:18:17,549 --> 00:18:18,967
它还拿走了我的遥控器
He took my remote.

274
00:18:20,677 --> 00:18:21,928
它不会把它飞走的
He won't be able to fly it.

275
00:18:22,179 --> 00:18:23,263
你肯定?
Do we know that for a fact?

276
00:18:23,388 --> 00:18:24,723
只有操作者拥有特定的基因, 古人的科技才能运作
I'm sure the Wraith were the main reason

277
00:18:24,848 --> 00:18:27,392
我认为这主要是是为了防范幽灵
the ancient technology only works
if the operator has a specific gene.

278
00:18:27,851 --> 00:18:29,978
无论如何, 他还是会夺走我们所有的武器, 食物和水...
Either way, he'll still have all of
our weapons, food, and water...

279
00:18:30,103 --> 00:18:31,354
由它去吧
Who cares?

280
00:18:31,813 --> 00:18:34,441
那如果它用我们的次空间无线电来通知它的同类呢?
What if he can use our subspace radio
to signal his friends?

281
00:18:35,901 --> 00:18:37,360
它应该可以这么做
He might be able to do that.

282
00:18:38,111 --> 00:18:39,237
那我要抢先赶过去
Not if I can get there first.

283
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:41,031
- 可它已经先去了
- 我会尽快的
He's got a head start. I can be pretty fast.

284
00:18:41,072 --> 00:18:42,699
Elizabeth会派出另外一艘飞船的
我们只需要等一下...
Elizabeth will send another jumper.
We just need to wait...

285
00:18:42,741 --> 00:18:43,992
你跟他在一起
Stay with him.

286
00:18:44,326 --> 00:18:45,577
不, 请不要丢下我们
No. Please don't leave us.

287
00:18:46,828 --> 00:18:48,538
他是对的, 我们应该呆在一起
He's right. We should stick together.

288
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,664
它杀了Abrams.
He killed Abrams.

289
00:18:49,706 --> 00:18:51,875
跟你一样, 我也很难过
但这只是由于我们都犯了一个错误...
I'm as sorry about that as you are,
but just because we both made an error...

290
00:18:51,917 --> 00:18:54,961
我没时间跟你争论这个!
I don't have time to argue about this!

291
00:18:55,212 --> 00:18:56,713
现在, 把你的无线电设置到二频道
Now, set your radio to channel two,

292
00:18:56,838 --> 00:18:58,590
不过你不要用它, 除非我呼叫你
but don't use it till you hear from me.

293
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:00,383
少校
Major.

294
00:19:01,259 --> 00:19:02,219
少校!
Major!

295
00:19:06,014 --> 00:19:07,307
没事儿, 这只是...
It's fine, just...

296
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:09,392
OK
Okay.

297
00:19:48,431 --> 00:19:49,683
看到什么了?
Anything?

298
00:19:50,267 --> 00:19:51,184
没有
No.

299
00:19:51,601 --> 00:19:53,061
希望只有这一个
Hopefully there's just the one.

300
00:19:55,856 --> 00:19:57,691
你不会让我在这等死, 对么?
You're not going to let me die out here, are you?

301
00:19:57,732 --> 00:19:59,109
当然, 不要胡思乱想了
No, don't be ridiculous.

302
00:19:59,442 --> 00:20:00,861
你明白, 我看得出来
You know, because people would talk.

303
00:20:02,153 --> 00:20:03,613
你为什么要那么做?
And why would they do that?

304
00:20:04,114 --> 00:20:05,323
这很明显
It's obvious.

305
00:20:05,365 --> 00:20:07,075
你害怕我会超越你
You're afraid I'll outshine you.

306
00:20:07,158 --> 00:20:09,452
我的意识, 我的青春...
My mind. My youth...

307
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:16,585
它到底夺走了我多少生命力?
How much of my life did he take?

308
00:20:16,626 --> 00:20:17,377
你看起来很好
You look fine.

309
00:20:17,419 --> 00:20:19,588
因为这就是它们所做的, 是不是?
它们夺走了你几十年生命
Because that's what they do, isn't it?
They take years off of your life.

310
00:20:21,798 --> 00:20:23,091
我看起来很老, 是不是?
I look old, don't I?

311
00:20:24,217 --> 00:20:26,511
你看起来老了一些, 是的
You look older, yes.

312
00:20:28,597 --> 00:20:29,723
让我看看
Show me.

313
00:20:29,931 --> 00:20:31,308
没有必要
There's no point in doing this.

314
00:20:31,349 --> 00:20:32,809
- 你只是...
- Rodney.
- You just...
- Rodney.

315
00:20:33,185 --> 00:20:34,519
让我看看
Show me.

316
00:20:48,658 --> 00:20:49,993
噢, 我的天啊!
Oh, my god!

317
00:20:50,952 --> 00:20:53,038
我不知道这是怎么搞的, Brendan.
我想没人知道
I don't know how it works, Brendan.
I don't think anybody does.

318
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:55,540
也许你并没有真正的变老
也许这跟平常的衰老机制不一样...
Maybe you haven't really aged.
Maybe it doesn't work that way.

319
00:20:55,582 --> 00:20:57,751
听我说, 有可能, 将来, 你会好起来的
Look, it's possible that,
in time, you could get better.

320
00:20:57,876 --> 00:20:59,961
现在重要的是你还活着
The important thing is that you're still alive.

321
00:21:04,716 --> 00:21:06,092
现在你可以动了么?
Can you move yet?

322
00:21:08,803 --> 00:21:11,806
我想我的手脚已经开始有知觉了
I think I'm starting to get
some feeling back in my extremities.

323
00:21:11,848 --> 00:21:13,308
好的, 那就好
Well, there's something.

324
00:21:15,977 --> 00:21:17,020
怎么?
What?

325
00:21:17,812 --> 00:21:19,314
我只是想在这帮帮忙
I'm just trying to help here.

326
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:22,108
瞧, 是你找到了那个昏迷不醒的的卫星
Look, you're the one who had
to find the stupid satellite.

327
00:21:24,778 --> 00:21:26,321
哈, 不要逗我笑了
Ah, don't make me laugh.

328
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,114
Yeah. 你不应该笑
Yeah. You shouldn't laugh.

329
00:21:28,281 --> 00:21:30,283
这... 这不是很好
It's... It's not so good.

330
00:22:41,897 --> 00:22:44,399
已经六个小时了. 他们仍然没有联系
It's been six hours. They still haven't checked in.

331
00:22:44,774 --> 00:22:46,484
还好我们已经在路上了
Good thing we left when we did.

332
00:22:46,902 --> 00:22:48,361
要小心, 中尉
Be careful, Lieutenant.

333
00:22:48,653 --> 00:22:49,696
遵命
Yes, ma'am.

334
00:22:49,905 --> 00:22:52,282
Gall说过在那个星球上用无线电可能会有问题
Gall said something about radio
being a problem on the surface,

335
00:22:52,407 --> 00:22:55,952
所以, 希望这只是由于
他们飞船上的次空间通信无法工作
so, hopefully, the jumper's subspace
communications are just down.

336
00:22:56,161 --> 00:22:58,205
我们已经准备好去做我们该做的了
We're prepared to do whatever we need to do.

337
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:00,498
你已经在这个太阳系的另外一边了, 中尉
You're on the other side of
the solar system, Lieutenant.

338
00:23:00,707 --> 00:23:02,292
你所说的就要变成现实了
It's going to be your call.

339
00:23:03,376 --> 00:23:05,086
是的, 夫人, 是这样
Yes, ma'am, it is.

340
00:23:09,341 --> 00:23:10,383
McKay
McKay.

341
00:23:11,718 --> 00:23:12,928
在
We're still here.

342
00:23:13,136 --> 00:23:15,430
这个狗娘养的赢了. 它太快了
The son of a bitch beat me to it. He's fast.

343
00:23:15,514 --> 00:23:16,765
那你应该回到这来
Then you should get back here.

344
00:23:16,806 --> 00:23:17,641
不行
Negative.

345
00:23:17,724 --> 00:23:19,351
你在外面毫无意义...
There's no point in you being out there...

346
00:23:19,392 --> 00:23:20,602
他在我的飞船上
He's aboard my ship.

347
00:23:20,727 --> 00:23:22,103
那又怎样, kirk船长?
What are you, Captain kirk?

348
00:23:22,145 --> 00:23:23,355
他又能把飞船怎样?
What good's it going to do him?

349
00:23:23,396 --> 00:23:24,439
我不知道
I don't know.

350
00:23:24,481 --> 00:23:27,776
也许它可以短接导线, 启动飞船
我也不想冒险
Maybe he can hotwire the damn thing.
I don't want to take a chance.

351
00:23:34,991 --> 00:23:37,702
你知道这个星球上的白天有多长么?
Do you have any idea how long
the days are on this planet?

352
00:23:37,744 --> 00:23:39,246
不知道. 干什么?
No. Why?

353
00:23:39,329 --> 00:23:43,166
因为我感觉到这里的夜晚将会非常寒冷
零度以下的寒冷
Because I've got a feeling the nights
are pretty damn cold, sub-zero cold.

354
00:23:44,167 --> 00:23:45,460
我们已经迟到六个小时了
We're six hours overdue.

355
00:23:45,502 --> 00:23:47,587
假设他们等了一个小时, 然后开始了救援行动...
Assuming they waited an hour
before sending a rescue mission...

356
00:23:47,629 --> 00:23:50,715
在救援飞船到来之前这里很可能会天黑
There's a very good chance it's going to
be dark before another jumper can get here.

357
00:23:50,924 --> 00:23:55,095
如果我们玩等待游戏的话
那这个在这里呆了一万年的家伙就会赢
If we play the waiting game, the guy who's
been around  for 10,000 years is going to win.

358
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:57,973
少校, 不管怎么说
他有能力活那么久
Major, anyone or anything
capable of surviving that long

359
00:23:58,056 --> 00:23:59,850
也就是说明他不是那么好就可以对付的
is going to be a serious adversary.

360
00:23:59,891 --> 00:24:01,726
是的, 除非我把引出到开阔地
Well, not if I get him out in the open.

361
00:24:01,893 --> 00:24:03,687
它不会明白我们的武器
He won't know about our weapons.

362
00:24:03,812 --> 00:24:07,065
如果不出意外, 我将会把飞船飞回来接你们
If all goes well, I'll fly the jumper
back and pick you up.

363
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:08,608
那如果出了意外呢?
And if all doesn't go well?

364
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:09,401
不会的
It will.

365
00:24:09,442 --> 00:24:11,361
事情不可能进行得如此顺利的
Things haven't gone all that well thus far.

366
00:24:11,444 --> 00:24:15,115
你知道, Rodney, 如果你有足够的火力的话
这些家伙还是会死的
You know, Rodney, these guys do die
if you have enough firepower.

367
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,491
好吧, 最终, 是的, 但是...
Well, eventually, yes, but...

368
00:24:16,533 --> 00:24:18,243
试图往好的方面想想
Try and stay positive.

369
00:24:19,411 --> 00:24:20,745
Gall感觉怎么样了?
How's gall feeling?

370
00:24:22,122 --> 00:24:23,874
他可以动他的脚趾了
His can move his toes.

371
00:24:23,999 --> 00:24:25,959
瞧, 一切都在往好的方向发展
See? Things are looking up.

372
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:45,187
我是John Sheppard少校
This is major John Sheppard.

373
00:24:46,354 --> 00:24:48,899
你正在把我的飞船弄得乱七八糟
我要你把它们都弄回原样
That's my ship you're messing with. I'd like it back.

374
00:24:50,108 --> 00:24:51,860
这是Lantian人的飞船
This ship is Lantian.

375
00:24:51,902 --> 00:24:53,570
是的, 它是
Yes, it is.

376
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,989
Lantians已经位于战败的边缘了
The Lantians were on the verge of defeat.

377
00:24:56,031 --> 00:24:57,449
好吧, 你不了解战争的结局
Well, you weren't around for the end of the war.

378
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:58,700
你那边战败了
Your side lost.

379
00:24:58,825 --> 00:25:00,035
不可能
Impossible.

380
00:25:00,076 --> 00:25:01,203
这是真的
It's true.

381
00:25:01,286 --> 00:25:03,330
你现在是同类中的最后一个了
You're the last of your kind.

382
00:25:04,748 --> 00:25:06,416
他们的城市被包围了
Their city was under siege.

383
00:25:06,458 --> 00:25:08,418
他们只剩下了Atlantis
Atlantis was all that remained.

384
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,587
胜利是必然的
Victory was inevitable.

385
00:25:10,712 --> 00:25:13,673
好吧, 你自己也看到了
我的飞船是Lantian人的
Well, you can see for yourself my ship is Lantian.

386
00:25:14,216 --> 00:25:16,968
我还活着证明我们仍然在周围
不过幽灵全部都死光了
I'm living proof we're still around,
but the Wraith were all gone.

387
00:25:17,344 --> 00:25:20,514
除了你, 再没有其他幽灵了
No one's left but you.

388
00:25:22,891 --> 00:25:25,769
你说的不会是真的
What you say cannot be true.

389
00:25:26,102 --> 00:25:28,396
你为什么不下来回到你自己的飞船亲自看看?
Why don't you come down to your
own ship and see for yourself?

390
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,066
我会一直等着你
I'll be waiting for you.

391
00:27:30,143 --> 00:27:33,230
你别想打败我!
You cannot hope to defeat me!

392
00:27:47,702 --> 00:27:49,287
看, 我是怎么跟你说的, aha?
There. What'd I tell you, huh?

393
00:27:51,122 --> 00:27:53,458
Rodney, 我感觉不是很好
Rodney, I don't feel so good.

394
00:27:56,795 --> 00:27:57,838
水
Water.

395
00:27:57,879 --> 00:27:59,130
可能需要一些水
Probably need some water.

396
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,343
McKay...
McKay...

397
00:28:04,469 --> 00:28:06,179
少校, 发生什么了?
Major, what's happening?

398
00:28:06,221 --> 00:28:07,514
我想你应该知道...
I thought you should know...

399
00:28:07,889 --> 00:28:09,349
第一回合打了个平手
Round one was a draw.

400
00:28:09,975 --> 00:28:11,351
我不喜欢这种声音
I don't like the sound of that.

401
00:28:11,518 --> 00:28:13,103
我也不喜欢. 我着火了
Me neither. I took some fire.

402
00:28:13,144 --> 00:28:14,229
你受伤了么?
Are you injured?

403
00:28:14,271 --> 00:28:16,314
是的, 这就是我说"我着火了"的意思
Yeah, that's what I mean by "I took some fire."

404
00:28:17,274 --> 00:28:22,362
不过我想还不算坏
但是我的P-90不能用了
But I don't think it's too bad,
but my P-90's out of commission.

405
00:28:23,196 --> 00:28:26,324
他在飞船中找到了一支9-mil
而且很快就学会了如何使用它
He found a 9-mil in the jumper,
figured out how to use it pretty fast.

406
00:28:26,366 --> 00:28:27,784
好吧, 幽灵可以治愈它自己
Well, the Wraith will heal itself.

407
00:28:27,826 --> 00:28:28,910
别开玩笑
No kidding.

408
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,788
我至少射了20发子弹在他身上
而且还有额外补了两发
I put at least 20 shot into him,
and a couple more for good measure.

409
00:28:32,122 --> 00:28:34,749
我看到幽灵倒下了
而且在我靠近时仍然倒在地上
I've seen Wraith go down and stay down with far less.

410
00:28:35,417 --> 00:28:37,127
这个家伙有点不一样
This guy's different somehow.

411
00:28:37,252 --> 00:28:39,546
Beckett博士已经研究出
幽灵可以治愈它们自己
Dr. Beckett has theorized that
a Wraith's ability to heal itself

412
00:28:39,588 --> 00:28:43,717
而这直接取决于它上次进食的时间
而这个幽灵...
is directly proportional to how
recently the Wraith has fed, and he's...

413
00:28:44,134 --> 00:28:45,677
刚刚才进食
Fed pretty recently.

414
00:28:46,178 --> 00:28:48,096
我想可能还不止这些
I think there's got to be more to it than that.

415
00:28:48,763 --> 00:28:50,599
Gall可以动他的手指了么?
Can Gall move his fingers yet?

416
00:28:51,349 --> 00:28:52,350
刚刚可以
Barely.

417
00:28:52,642 --> 00:28:54,269
好的, 那就塞一支枪到他的手里
All right, then stick a gun in his hand.

418
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:55,437
少校?
Major?

419
00:28:55,478 --> 00:28:57,105
只是怕万一我回不来了
Just in case I don't make it back.

420
00:28:57,189 --> 00:28:58,231
Sheppard出局了
Sheppard out.

421
00:28:58,648 --> 00:28:59,983
这很令人鼓舞, huh?
That's comforting, huh?

422
00:29:00,609 --> 00:29:02,694
好吧, 水
All right. Water.

423
00:29:21,671 --> 00:29:22,714
噢, 该死!
Oh, crap!

424
00:29:35,018 --> 00:29:36,228
少校, 到底是怎么回事?
Major, what the hell was that?

425
00:29:36,269 --> 00:29:37,771
我差点把我自己炸死
I almost blew myself up.

426
00:29:37,812 --> 00:29:38,480
什么?
What?

427
00:29:38,522 --> 00:29:40,023
别说了, 我很忙
Stay off the radio. I'm busy.

428
00:29:40,065 --> 00:29:41,274
好吧
Right.

429
00:29:42,108 --> 00:29:43,026
他很忙
He's busy.

430
00:29:45,362 --> 00:29:47,155
你想出去帮他, 是么?
You want to get out there and help him, don't you?

431
00:29:47,322 --> 00:29:49,407
什么? 让我去对付一个幽灵? 你不是开玩笑吧?
What? Me go up against a Wraith? Are you kidding?

432
00:29:49,449 --> 00:29:51,618
你是这样想的, 我知道
You do, I can tell.

433
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,578
你已经变了
You've changed.

434
00:29:53,912 --> 00:29:55,121
你真的很想出去
You really want to get out there.

435
00:29:55,163 --> 00:29:56,540
- 住嘴
- 别阻止我
- Shut up.
- Don't get me wrong.

436
00:29:56,581 --> 00:29:58,041
我很感动
I'm impressed.

437
00:29:58,291 --> 00:29:59,835
你想出去战斗
You want in the fight.

438
00:30:00,126 --> 00:30:01,545
我原先所了解的Rodney McKay将...
The Rodney McKay I knew would never...

439
00:30:01,711 --> 00:30:03,255
你也听到他说的了, 我们都要呆在这里
You heard the man. We're staying right here.

440
00:30:12,347 --> 00:30:13,390
对
Right.

441
00:30:14,891 --> 00:30:18,353
拿住这个, 不过除非我叫你,
不要朝任何东西射击, 明白?
Take this, but don't shoot at anything
until I tell you to, okay?

442
00:30:18,478 --> 00:30:19,104
明白
Okay.

443
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:14,868
你想要这个?
You want some of this?

444
00:31:45,565 --> 00:31:47,651
好了, 好了, 够了
Okay, okay. That's enough.

445
00:33:55,445 --> 00:33:56,947
你是对的, 我必须出去
You're right. I should go out there.

446
00:33:56,988 --> 00:33:58,365
我没有说你必须这样做
I didn't say you should.

447
00:33:58,490 --> 00:33:59,866
我知是说你想这么做
I said you wanted to.

448
00:34:02,077 --> 00:34:03,912
因为我必须这样做
Because I should.

449
00:34:03,954 --> 00:34:05,288
不, 你没有必要
No, you shouldn't.

450
00:34:05,956 --> 00:34:07,582
不过不要让我妨碍你
But don't let me stop you.

451
00:34:08,124 --> 00:34:10,335
如果你真的认为你出去可以帮助少校的话...
If you really think you can help
the major by going out...

452
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,795
我不能让你留在这儿
I can't leave you here.

453
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:13,380
不, 你可以
Yes, you can.

454
00:34:14,089 --> 00:34:15,632
这有什么不同么?
What difference does it make?

455
00:34:15,799 --> 00:34:17,634
你和我都知道我活不了了
You and I both know I'm not going to make it.

456
00:34:17,676 --> 00:34:18,844
别胡说了
Stop being so dramatic.

457
00:34:18,885 --> 00:34:20,720
每一分钟, 你都在变得更加强壮
You're getting stronger by the minute.

458
00:34:21,763 --> 00:34:23,431
我从来没有感到如此虚弱过
I've never felt so weak.

459
00:34:23,682 --> 00:34:24,933
那就不要讲话了
Then stop talking.

460
00:34:25,392 --> 00:34:27,894
我要死了, Rodney. 我可以感觉得到
I'm dying, Rodney. I can feel it.

461
00:34:27,936 --> 00:34:28,770
住嘴!
Stop it!

462
00:34:28,812 --> 00:34:30,730
我不会好了, 我正变得越来越虚弱
I'm not getting better. I'm getting worse.

463
00:34:31,982 --> 00:34:35,527
它留给我一小部分生命
好让你留在这里看着我死
He left me with just enough life
so that you'd have to watch me die.

464
00:34:36,027 --> 00:34:37,112
听我说
Listen to me.

465
00:34:37,153 --> 00:34:41,116
你需要的只是一餐好饭, 一壶茶, 和停止说话, 然后...
All you need is a good meal,
a pot of tea, and to stop talking, and...

466
00:34:43,118 --> 00:34:44,077
Brendan!
Brendan!

467
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:47,372
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

468
00:34:48,957 --> 00:34:50,125
我说过不要讲话了
You said to stop talking.

469
00:34:50,166 --> 00:34:52,627
我很抱歉, 我原以为你已经...
I'm sorry, I thought you'd...

470
00:34:53,128 --> 00:34:54,462
抱歉
Apologies.

471
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,882
做得对
Nice work.

472
00:35:24,409 --> 00:35:25,994
现在不行, 伙计们
Not now, guys.

473
00:35:56,441 --> 00:35:58,109
我们大概可以进行无线电联系了, 长官
We may be able to make radio contact now, sir.

474
00:35:58,568 --> 00:36:01,238
少校, 我是Ford中尉. 回话
Major, this is lieutenant Ford. Come in.

475
00:36:04,282 --> 00:36:07,285
少校, 我们一小时内就到
请回答
Major, we should be there inside an hour.
Please respond.

476
00:36:08,828 --> 00:36:10,413
也许我们仍然离得太远
Perhaps we're still too far away.

477
00:36:10,497 --> 00:36:12,165
要么就是他们在那个星球上收不到信号
Or maybe they can't get a signal on the planet.

478
00:36:13,333 --> 00:36:15,335
看看你能不能让这个东西跑得更快一点
See if you can make this thing go a little faster.

479
00:36:16,211 --> 00:36:18,630
你认为我是一个白痴么, Sheppard少校?
Do you think I'm a fool, Major Sheppard?

480
00:36:19,422 --> 00:36:22,175
在这个星球上, 你无处可去
There is nowhere for you to go on this world.

481
00:36:22,509 --> 00:36:27,097
当我吃你的时候
我会好好品尝你反抗的滋味的
When I feed upon you,
I will savor the taste of your defiance.

482
00:36:27,138 --> 00:36:28,056
嗨, 你
Hey, you.

483
00:36:28,557 --> 00:36:29,683
在这儿
Over here.

484
00:36:29,724 --> 00:36:31,393
在地上, 无线电
On the ground, the radio.

485
00:36:35,605 --> 00:36:40,235
这个星球的白天很长
不过夜晚非常寒冷
The days on this planet are long,
but the nights are cold.

486
00:36:40,443 --> 00:36:42,320
迟早...
Sooner or later...

487
00:36:42,362 --> 00:36:43,905
我会抓住你
I will have you.

488
00:36:44,447 --> 00:36:49,411
想把我的生命从我的身体中吸出来?
除非你按一下无线电上的按钮, 否则我听不到你的威胁
I can't hear you threatening to suck the life out
of me till you hit the button on the radio.

489
00:37:24,863 --> 00:37:26,114
你听到了么?
Did you hear that?

490
00:37:26,489 --> 00:37:27,115
没有
No.

491
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:28,742
我想我听到了什么
I thought I heard something.

492
00:37:30,493 --> 00:37:32,162
可能还有一个正在冬眠
Maybe there's another one hibernating.

493
00:37:32,329 --> 00:37:33,163
不是
No.

494
00:37:34,956 --> 00:37:36,416
太久了
It's been too long.

495
00:37:37,083 --> 00:37:39,669
我想少校可能碰到了麻烦
如果他碰到了麻烦, 那我们就麻烦了
I think the major could be in trouble,
and if he's in trouble, we're in trouble.

496
00:37:40,879 --> 00:37:41,963
那就去吧
Then go.

497
00:37:42,631 --> 00:37:43,673
你认为你可以动了么?
Do you think you could move?

498
00:37:44,216 --> 00:37:45,467
不行
Not a chance.

499
00:37:46,301 --> 00:37:47,969
我哪也不去
I'm not going anywhere.

500
00:37:48,345 --> 00:37:49,137
好吧
Okay.

501
00:37:49,763 --> 00:37:50,931
没事
That's okay.

502
00:37:51,348 --> 00:37:52,182
去吧
Go.

503
00:37:52,766 --> 00:37:54,643
Rodney, 快去吧
Rodney, just go.

504
00:37:56,478 --> 00:37:57,938
拯救这一天
Save the day.

505
00:37:59,189 --> 00:38:00,607
我真正想做的就是通过无线电呼叫他
What I really want to do is call him on the radio,

506
00:38:00,732 --> 00:38:02,025
但是我怕他正在躲避幽灵
but I'm afraid if he's hiding from the Wraith,

507
00:38:02,108 --> 00:38:03,443
我可能不经意间暴露了他的位置
I might inadvertently give away his position,

508
00:38:03,568 --> 00:38:07,197
让我们面对现实吧
如果Sheppard不能把幽灵除掉, 我们还有多少机会?
and let's face it, what chance would we have
against the Wraith if Sheppard can't take him out?

509
00:38:07,197 --> 00:38:08,865
我曾想你可以恢复过来, 这样我...
I was hoping you'd be strong that I...

510
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:18,250
不, 不
Oh, no.

511
00:38:30,178 --> 00:38:31,763
你一定是在跟我开玩笑
You've got to be kidding me.

512
00:38:31,888 --> 00:38:38,353
我已经吃了不计其数的人类和lantians
甚至是我的同类
I have fed upon countless thousands of humans
and lantians, even upon my own crew,

513
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:42,566
而且我可以在今天结束之前吃掉你
and I will feed upon you before this day is done.

514
00:38:49,281 --> 00:38:51,408
少校, 我是Ford中尉
请回答
Major, this is lieutenant Ford. Please respond.

515
00:38:51,491 --> 00:38:52,826
中尉, 你来得太及时了
Lieutenant, I like your timing.

516
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:54,244
快点过来
Get your ass down here.

517
00:38:54,286 --> 00:38:56,621
长官, 我们最快也要在二十分钟后才能赶到
Sir, we're still two-zero minutes away at top speed.

518
00:38:56,913 --> 00:38:59,958
好吧, 那样的话, 你们的时间不多了
赶快到这里来
Well, in that case, your timing sucks.
Get here as soon as you can.

519
00:39:02,669 --> 00:39:04,337
你需要我才能离开这个星球
You need me to get off this planet.

520
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:07,007
只有我才能开动那艘飞船
I'm the only one who can fly that ship.

521
00:39:09,009 --> 00:39:11,970
我只需要你的手来操作那些控制器就可以了
I will use your dead hands to operate its controls.

522
00:39:46,254 --> 00:39:47,088
少校?
Major?

523
00:39:48,256 --> 00:39:49,132
McKay!
McKay!

524
00:39:49,758 --> 00:39:51,009
我现在该怎么办?
What do I do now?

525
00:39:51,468 --> 00:39:53,345
一直开火, 直到打完你所有的子弹!
Keep firing everything you've got!

526
00:40:00,018 --> 00:40:01,478
好了, 现在呢?
Okay, now what?

527
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,562
重新装弹
Reload.

528
00:40:10,862 --> 00:40:12,739
我们看到到他们在星球上的生命信号了
We're picking up their life signs on the planet.

529
00:40:13,198 --> 00:40:14,324
向他们直飞过去
Head straight for them.

530
00:40:14,491 --> 00:40:15,742
长官, 我们在瞄准镜中看到你了
Sir, we're picking you up on the aim.

531
00:40:27,629 --> 00:40:28,713
没有子弹了!
No more bullets!

532
00:40:53,446 --> 00:40:56,366
Ford, 朝着你所看到的最大的生命信号开火
Ford, lock onto the biggest
life-sign signals you can see and fire.

533
00:40:56,491 --> 00:40:58,201
不行, 长官. 你们太近了!
Negative, sir. You're too close!

534
00:40:58,243 --> 00:41:00,412
这是命令, 中尉
执行吧!
That's an order, Lieutenant.
Do it!

535
00:41:01,246 --> 00:41:02,497
对准那个目标开火
Fire on that target.

536
00:41:06,251 --> 00:41:07,294
McKay, 快跑!
McKay, run!

537
00:41:30,817 --> 00:41:31,902
McKay?
McKay?

538
00:41:33,403 --> 00:41:34,362
还在这里!
Still here!

539
00:41:36,114 --> 00:41:37,199
长官, 我是Ford
Sir, this is Ford.

540
00:41:37,616 --> 00:41:38,867
目标消失了
The target is gone.

541
00:41:39,242 --> 00:41:41,536
很好, 正是时候
Well, it's about damn time.

542
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:44,247
我们是尽快赶来的, 不能再快了, 少校
We got here as soon as we could, Major.

543
00:41:44,414 --> 00:41:45,790
我不是这个意思
That's not what I meant.

544
00:41:45,874 --> 00:41:46,917
多谢
Thanks.

545
00:41:47,542 --> 00:41:48,418
不客气, 长官
You're welcome, Sir.

546
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:49,878
我们几分钟后就到
We'll be there in just a few minutes.

547
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,171
我们可以等
We can wait.

548
00:42:10,023 --> 00:42:11,107
谢谢
Thanks.

549
00:42:11,316 --> 00:42:15,362
Yeah. 你也一样
你还好吧?
Yeah. You too.
You okay?

550
00:42:15,695 --> 00:42:17,864
除了这个和几根破碎的肋骨...
Other than this and a few cracked ribs...

551
00:42:23,995 --> 00:42:25,580
Gall怎么样?
What about Gall?

552
00:42:26,998 --> 00:42:28,333
不好
No.

553
00:42:43,098 --> 00:42:48,103
你们可能必须合力把这个飞船恢复原状
尽你所能把防护罩关掉
You'll have to put the ship back together,
provided you could disarm the shield.

554
00:42:49,104 --> 00:42:49,855
好的
Fine.

555
00:42:50,063 --> 00:42:51,439
只要我们可以回家
As long as we get to go home.

556
00:42:52,482 --> 00:42:53,733
你可以驾驶
You can drive.

557
00:42:53,775 --> 00:42:55,026
噢, 谢谢


Oh, thank you.
