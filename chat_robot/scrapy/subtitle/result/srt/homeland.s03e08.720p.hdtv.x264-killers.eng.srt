1
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,090
<i>Air and naval forces of the United States</i>

2
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,980
<i>launched a series of strikes against terrorist facilities...</i>

3
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,430
<i>Pan Am flight 103 crashed into the town of Lockerbie.</i>

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,770
<i>He has sanctioned acts of terror</i> <i>in Africa, Europe and the Middle East.</i>

5
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:20,740
<i>This will not stand, this aggression against, uh, Kuwait.</i>

6
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,600
<i>This relentless pursuit of terror.</i>

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,750
<i>We will make no distinction...</i>

8
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,570
<i>The USS Cole was attacked</i> <i>while refueling in the port of Aden.</i>

9
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:28,090
This was an act of terrorism.

10
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,310
It was a despicable and cowardly act.

11
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:35,230
<i>The next samba we're going to swing for you</i> is one of the good old favorites.

12
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:37,830
...until something stops him.

13
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,620
<i>It was right in front of my eyes,</i>

14
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,250
<i>and I never saw it coming.</i>

15
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,770
<i>That plane crashed into the World Trade Center.</i>

16
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,520
<i>Thousands of people running.</i>

17
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,390
We must and we will remain vigilant at home and abroad.

18
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:00,740
<i>You're the smartest and the dumbest fucking person</i> <i>I've ever known.</i>

19
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,380
<i>I'm not the one who got it wrong.</i> <i>I'm the only one who got it right.</i>

20
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:10,530
<i>Take 'em.</i>

21
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:12,790
<i>Take 'em all.</i>

22
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,410
<i>Previously on Homeland...</i>

23
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:28,660
I'm an associate at Bennett, Parr and Hamilton.

24
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:33,220
One of our partners would like to meet with you. Miss Mathison, Leland Bennett.

25
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:36,320
What does your client want? To pick your brain from time to time.

26
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,610
Put you on retainer as it were.

27
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,680
No sound.

28
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,910
Take it off.

29
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,120
Carrie Mathison.

30
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,320
It's time we talk about Nasser Hejazi.

31
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,080
Whose name you used to embezzle more than $45 million.

32
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,400
You are now an enemy of your own state.

33
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,910
I got plans for you. What plans?

34
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:02,520
I'm gonna play you back into Iran. From now on you work for us.

35
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,490
For me.

36
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:07,220
I've recruited a high-level Iranian asset. Majid Javadi.

37
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,920
The man who financed the bombing of the CIA?

38
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,200
We talked about this.

39
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,120
The need to wean you of your cold war bullshit.

40
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,020
This is a once in a lifetime operation that can transform everything.

41
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:24,450
The entire Middle East. You sound like you're fucking high.

42
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,580
I need to know something before you leave. I need to know...

43
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,510
who's responsible for the bomb?

44
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:34,210
<i>You know what he asked me?</i>
Who moved the bomb?

45
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,730
If it was Brody. Now, why would he ask me that?

46
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:42,320
That implies that there's a difference of opinion on that subject.

47
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,740
You should know that the man who built the bomb and moved the SUV,

48
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,960
he didn't die in the explosion like they say.

49
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,860
As far as I know, he's still in this country. Where?

50
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,820
I don't know.
Who does?

51
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:57,000
The man that brought us together. Your lawyer? Bennett?

52

Fuck!

56
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,020
What happened to you?

57
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,870
I started to get worried. I'm out of practice.

58
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,080
Well...

59
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,860
this looks delicious, Saul.

60
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,890
Thank you.

61
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,430
Can I pour you a cup of tea? Please.

62
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,720
Where did you get these from?

63
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,230
Aren't these the mugs we brought back from the Philippines?

64
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,530
The very last pair.

65
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:03,990
When this is all over,

66
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,570
I'd like to go back to that island on the Sulu Sea.

67
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,310
You know, you don't have to promise anything.

68
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:14,300
Really. I understand.

69
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:18,320
No, I don't see why not.
We might actually have fun.

70
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:21,650
Well, the evidence does seem to indicate that that is possible

71
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:22,570
after all.

72
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,540
Is there any chance

73
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:32,670
that you could stay home today?

74
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,590
There's nothing I'd rather do.

75
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,270
But?

76
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:47,220
I got a meeting with Mike Higgins this morning at the White House.

77
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,850
- When? - 9:30.

78
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,770
Well, that gives us an hour and a half...

79
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,030
by my count.

80
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,680
Yes, it does.

81
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:10,830
Okay, here's something.

82
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,770
Dr. Maximillian Aziz, Jordanian,

83
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:16,430
was actually in the auditorium the time the bomb went off.

84
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:21,170
Ops or Intelligence? Intelligence- Office of Transnational Issues.

85
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:23,560
And what's his connection to Leland Bennett?

86
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,470
He wrote a lengthy analysis of the firm's hip-pocket clients.

87
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:31,110
Iran, Syria, Azerbaijan. This was two years ago.

88
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,540
It hardly fits the profile.

89
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:36,780
Any munitions training? Experience with explosives?

90
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,250
Uh... no.

91
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:44,530
All right, add him to the list anyway. Yeah, which begs the question-

92
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:47,880
are we even sure that the guy who made the bomb moved Brody's car?

93
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,290
- Depends. - On what?

94
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,000
On whether or not you believe Javadi.

95
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,350
- Which you do. - Which I do.

96
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:56,630
But it takes more than an opinion to put it in front of Saul.

97
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:57,330
Right.

98
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,360
You know, I can't help but feel we're spinning our wheels here.

99
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,360
The FBI have been through these files a hundred times.

100
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,370
Anybody that was at Langley that day has been turned inside-out and upside-down.

101
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:09,810
Yeah, well, someone who was at Langley that day did the bombing.

102
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:19,260
I still can't believe all these people are gone.

103
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:22,490
Yeah.

104
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:28,260
Where's Fara anyway? She was supposed to be here over an hour ago.

105
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:21,500
TOP
SECRET

106
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,610
- Come on in, Saul. - Hey, Mike.

107
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:31,590
Good to see you.

108
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,680
Senator?

109
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,090
Yeah.

110
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:43,560
The Senator's made some serious allegations.

111
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,630
Which are?

112
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,860
That you had Majid Javadi in a safe house,

113
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,890
on American soil and let him go.

114
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,870
Do you contest that?

115
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:55,020
Yes and no. What's the yes?

116
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,410
I'm not aware of any standing order to arrest Colonel Javadi.

117
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:00,730
- Did you have him in custody or not? - I did.

118
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:04,530
Aw, Jesus fucking Christ, Saul. We didn't just "Let him go," Mike.

119
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:07,850
We debriefed him. Turned him.

120
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:11,050
Sent him back to Iran. You turned him?

121
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:14,460
He's ours. With no guarantee that he'll actually cooperate.

122
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,230
- He will. - How do you know?

123
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:19,370
Because I know the man. Because he knows the game.

124
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:23,220
That is total speculation. He's right.

125
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,550
We haven't had a whole lot of success - in that department lately. - Well, we have now.

126
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:29,770
Javadi's the highest placed CIA asset in the history of the Agency.

127
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:33,080
He ordered and financed the attack on Langley.

128
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,240
All the better if he did. He's above suspicion.

129
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,410
A high-profile arrest would've sent a clear message to the Mullahs.

130
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:40,150
Back the fuck down.

131
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:43,840
Instead we have a live source, keeping us current on Iran's pursuit of a nuclear weapon,

132
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,580
on Hezbollah operations all over the globe.

133
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,040
How come I never saw a finding on this? We were responding to events on the ground.

134
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,870
The call had to be made in real time.

135
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,450
That is horseshit, and he knows it.

136
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,330
Mike, I think it's time you excuse the Senator.

137
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,710
What are you talking about?

138
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:05,050
I called this meeting to brief the Chief of Staff on the second phase of the mission.

139
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,050
- So, go ahead. - I can't.

140
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,340
- Not with you present. - Why not?

141
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,480
Because your security clearance is one level below operational.

142
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,120
You see what I'm dealing with?

143
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,230
The man is out of hand and out of control.

144
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,920
And in this case, he's correct. I'm sorry, Senator.

145
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,110
Mike, in nine days, I'm the next DCI.

146
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:25,600
And in nine days, Saul will brief you on whatever you need to know.

147
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,120
- But not until then. - Mike...

148
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,190
Senator.

149
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,920
- Mike? - Senator, please.

150
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,350
Goddamn it, Saul.

151
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:47,040
I spent the last month and a half arranging a marriage between you two.

152
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,850
I'm out, I know that.

153
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:51,960
You are now. You didn't need to be.

154
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,600
Javadi was worth it.

155
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:01,670
All right, tell me about this phase two.

156
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,180
Regime change?

157
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,880
Eventually. We're setting the stage.

158
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,400
How?

159
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:27,770
First we move Javadi up the chain of command into a senior military position.

160
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:30,220
How?! Keep reading.

161
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,340
Sorry I'm late.

162
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,450
Traffic.

163
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:57,320
I ordered you a macchiato, but it's probably cold by now.

164
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,420
Thank you.

165
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,250
It's fine.

166
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:08,810
So I got your text. Everything okay?

167
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:09,780
Yes.

168
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,370
No.

169
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,990
It's... Saul.

170
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,550
What about him?

171
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:23,920
We've made a decision. Well, I-I've made a decision.

172
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,400
To give the marriage another chance.

173
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,450
I...

174
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:31,840
You have to know, it's not easy for me.

175
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,250
And when, uh, did you decide all this?

176
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,490
Last night.

177
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:43,060
Forgive me, but didn't we just spend yesterday in a suite

178
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,540
at the Ritz Carlton?

179
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,500
What's changed?

180
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,070
I- I just told you.

181
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,840
What, suddenly Saul and you have decided to reconcile?

182
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,520
It's not suddenly.

183
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:02,050
We've been talking about it for the last two months. You know that.

184
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:05,040
Well, I was under the impression that you had given up on that.

185
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:09,000
That you both had. Well, I don't know, maybe we had.

186
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,820
Then there's something you're not telling me.

187
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,830
- We've been married 35 years. - I love you.

188
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,290
Don't say that. I love making love to you.

189
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,520
- I have to go. - Mira...

190
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,300
Good-bye.

191
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:40,170
He signed off? Well, let's put it this way-

192
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:43,690
he sees the merits of the operation. So he's taking it to the President?

193
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,450
- Yes. - Merits?

194
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:50,110
Saul, it's fucking genius. If we can pull it off.

195
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:52,170
- When are you leaving? - Tomorrow morning.

196
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:55,600
Does Carrie know you're going? She can't even suspect it.

197
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,390
Heard you were looking for me.

198
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:03,080
Yeah, we were just going over the transcript of your debrief with Javadi

199
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,700
to see if it supported what he told Carrie - on the tarmac yesterday. - Which was?

200
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,940
That the man who moved the SUV is still in the United States,

201
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,470
and he's somehow connected to Leland Bennett's law firm.

202
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:13,420
- Connected how? - It's unclear.

203
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:17,830
We were hoping you could shed some light. Javadi didn't mention the Bennett connection.

204
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:22,050
Well, what about Brody? Did he mention Brody?

205
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,310
In what context?

206
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:27,100
In the context of being the bomber.

207
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,040
Not in so many words, he didn't. Well, what did he say?

208
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,600
He said as far as he knows, Brody didn't move the car.

209
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:35,380
As far as he knows?

210
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,160
That's not what he told me.

211
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,860
- Okay. - He told me definitively it wasn't Brody.

212
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,760
What's your point? Why would he tell us two different stories?

213
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,750
Is that a question or an accusation?

214
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:49,270
Well, I guess I'd like a straight answer.

215
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:53,340
And if Javadi even intimated that Brody didn't move the car, why not press him on who did?

216
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:56,040
Well, you're angry because I didn't share a conversation with you about Brody.

217
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:56,690
An inconclusive one.

218
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:00,880
No, I'm angry because you seem entirely indifferent to catching the actual bomber.

219
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,790
Speak for yourself. I'm all for it. Well, I'm glad to hear it.

220
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,030
So... you two... actually have a plan?

221
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,790
Yeah. Yeah, we want to flush this guy out into the open.

222
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,940
Mm-hmm. How?

223
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,710
You know Leland Bennett personally, right?

224
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:22,660
We've golfed Congressional a few times together.

225
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,760
And we serve on the board of the Northam Foundation.

226
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:29,450
How comfortable would you be making an approach?

227
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,750
Comfortable enough.

228
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:08,920
Oh, back already? Yeah, I'm not feeling well.

229
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,450
You can go. I'll look after him today.

230
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:14,800
You sure? Yeah. How is he?

231
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,390
Oh, sitting up. Progress.

232
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,430
Yeah, slowly but surely.

233
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:21,810
I'll see you tomorrow.

234
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:24,060
Feel better. Thanks.

235
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,530
Baba Joon.

236
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:30,030
I'm staying home today.

237
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:34,920
Do I need a reason?

238
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,560
I'm not going to lose my job.

239
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:47,290
Because I'm sure.

240
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:48,670
Speak English.

241
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,010
English.

242
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:03,460
I did not come to America to live in the street like a dirty Arab.

243
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,550
Baba... listen to me.

244
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:08,780
Nothing like that is going to happen. No one's going to throw us out of our home.

245
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,370
Don't worry.

246
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:13,840
My job's safe.

247
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,180
At the bank?

248
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,290
Yes.

249
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,920
At the investment bank.

250
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,820
If you work at the bank,

251
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,060
why are we not rich?

252
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:38,830
Richter. That's a German surname. My parents were born in Hamburg.

253
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:41,480
Do you speak it? <i>Ja nat眉rlich.</i>

254
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,660
That's useful.

255
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:46,820
We represent three private banking houses in Berlin.

256
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:50,560
Would you, uh, excuse me for just a moment?

257
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,530
Of course.

258
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,230
You're early.

259
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:04,010
I'm in the middle of interviewing a new associate. It won't take long.

260
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,480
We missed you at the foundation meeting last week.

261
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,950
Couldn't get there. Work.

262
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,310
You gotta make time for us.

263
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:16,810
It's not enough that I've raised over a million dollars this quarter?

264
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,530
You know me. Never satisfied.

265
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,410
But... that's not what this is about.

266
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,700
- No? - No.

267
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,960
Sounds ominous.

268
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,820
I do terror now, by the way.

269
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:34,130
I'm not sure you knew that. I don't think I did.

270
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:39,120
Your firm's name has come up lately. More than once.

271
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,630
- In what light? - That I can't tell you.

272
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,520
Then why tell me at all?

273
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,410
Because tomorrow morning at exactly 10:00, I walk into a high level,

274
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:51,570
 top secret meeting at which you are the agenda.

275
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:54,750
What do you want?

276
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,720
Cooperate with us. Come clean.

277
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,210
Get out in front of what's sure to turn into a...

278
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,540
a bruising investigation.

279
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:08,510
You know what?

280
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:12,330
20 years ago, I might've fallen for that weak shit.

281
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:13,540
But today...

282
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,550
come after me if you want. I've got nothing to hide.

283
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:56,130
Text
a red wheel barrow.

284
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,510
Who's the candle for?

285
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,010
All the departed.

286
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:03,300
You Orthodox?

287
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,470
Old boyfriend.

288
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,740
I hear the weddings go on forever.

289
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:18,790
Longer than the marriages, so goes the joke.

290
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:23,760
Mr. Bennett needs you to look into something for him.

291
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,090
My arrangement's with Majid Javadi,

292
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:28,660
not Leland Bennett. Correct.

293
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:32,430
But what Mr. Bennett heard today might reverberate onto you.

294
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:35,320
Onto me? Do I need to remind you-

295
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,630
you're a recruited agent of a foreign government?

296
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,810
I met with Javadi. Once.

297
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:44,280
I agreed to consult with him. I'm nobody's agent.

298
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,940
I doubt the CIA would appreciate the distinction. What the hell do you know about it?

299
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:52,490
I know the law firm appears to be the target of an inquiry of some kind.

300
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,490
Well, not one that I'm aware of.

301
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:59,290
The warning was delivered personally,

302
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:01,220
outside of official channels.

303
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,830
By somebody who works at the Agency?

304
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:06,490
A longtime acquaintance of Mr. Bennett, yes.

305
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:11,040
So what do you want from me?

306
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,680
Confirm the report.

307
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,390
Mr. Bennett needs to know what part of the business is under investigation

308
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,830
and what he can do to protect himself.

309
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:25,090
That's not going to be easy. Not without setting off alarm bells.

310
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:27,400
You'll figure something out. I'll figure something out?

311
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,360
And obviously there's a clock on this. Obviously.

312
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:03,440
Hello? It's on.

313
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,160
Tell me. I just met with Franklin.

314
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,510
They're panicking over there. Well, let them.

315
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,960
Wait 24 hours...

316
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,880
then hit them with the news we know who the bomber is.

317
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,010
Will do.

318
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,500
Uh, Saul?

319
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,290
Yeah?

320
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,100
I need some personal time between then and now.

321
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,270
You got it.

322
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:25,050
- Thanks. - You all right?

323
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:27,760
Yeah.

324
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,470
I should've shared that intel about Brody with you sooner.

325
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:33,470
I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking. You've been to hell and back.

326
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:35,410
I know how important this is to you.

327
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:39,230
I owe you. We all do.

328
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:41,930
Yeah, well, as long as we get the real bomber...

329
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:42,960
We will.

330
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,070
Carrie?

331
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:00,610
Yeah. How'd you know? Tone of your voice.

332
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:02,640
You don't talk to anyone else like that.

333
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,440
Huh, I wasn't aware. You ready to eat?

334
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,850
Should I open a bottle of wine? That's a great idea.

335
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,950
Listen... I got to go away for a few days.

336
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:19,890
You do?

337
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:21,760
- Yeah. - When?

338
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,850
Tomorrow.

339
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,600
Saul... I know.

340
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,730
The timing's not great.

341
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,180
But you said only a couple of days?

342
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:35,070
Yeah. A week, at the most.

343
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:37,630
A week?

344
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,500
I wouldn't be going...

345
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,540
if I didn't absolutely have to.

346
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,080
You know what, I could go with you.

347
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,010
- Wouldn't that be great? - Why not?

348
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:51,660
It's not that kind of trip.

349
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,570
I wish it were.

350
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,170
- Cheers. - Cheers.

351
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,370
To us.

352
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,750
You've been nauseous? Yeah.

353
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,840
Usually that goes away by now.

354
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,290
So I've heard.

355
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,100
I'm getting a real clear image here.

356
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,630
You want to know if it's a boy or a girl?

357
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:28,720
No.

358
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:41,950
Sorry this is so last-minute. No, no, it's great to see you.

359
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:43,990
This is quite a surprise.

360
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:46,880
I saw Maggie at the hospital last week, she didn't say a thing.

361
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,100
She doesn't know.

362
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:52,490
Does that have anything to do with why you're coming in for your first prenatal exam

363
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:53,870
13 weeks in?

364
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:57,000
I didn't exactly plan this.

365
00:24:57,610 --> 00:24:59,670
But you've known for some time.

366
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,750
What about medications? What are you currently taking?

367
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:09,390
Uh, at the moment, nothing. I see.

368
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:14,020
I was on 1,800 milligrams of lithium for about a month there.

369
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:16,440
Things were a little out of control.

370
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:20,850
And, uh, before that,
there was a lot of drinking.

371
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,880
A... lot.

372
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,430
After you knew?

373
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:32,680
I haven't been painting a nursery, just put it that way.

374
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:35,930
Are you telling me you wish to terminate?

375
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:40,590
I just want to know what the tests say. If things are okay.

376
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:42,670
Well...

377
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,970
you're iron deficient.

378
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:48,080
We can fix that. But your blood pressure's very high.

379
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:52,610
I've been... really stressed at work.

380
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:54,650
Well, you really should be taking it easy.

381
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,540
Yeah, I'll try.

382
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:02,080
Carrie, we can manage this. Keep you and the baby healthy.

383
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,360
It's not magic, it's a process.

384
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,510
You want to leave it to chance, that's up to you.

385
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:08,670
Otherwise you need to modify your behavior.

386
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:11,640
Not in a week or two, or when it's convenient.

387
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,600
Now.

388
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:21,070
What I'm doing, it has to do with the father. I need to make some things right.

389
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:24,280
It matters to a lot of people.

390
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:28,330
But this is different, Carrie. You're not on your own anymore.

391
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,020
Fara? Sherazi?

392
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,610
And you are? Mitchell Clausen.

393
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:55,320
From the IG's Office.

394
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,100
IG? Inspector General.

395
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,300
May I come in?

396
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:05,300
This way.

397
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,930
May I offer you something? I'm good. Um...

398
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:15,380
you called in sick two days in a row.

399
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:18,960
Is something the matter? Migraines.

400
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,520
Yet you drove into work yesterday. Yes.

401
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:28,350
Where you sat in the parking lot for over half an hour before deciding to leave again.

402
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:30,600
I was hoping the headache would go away.

403
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:35,220
Is that why you then paid a visit to 1426 Longhill Road,

404
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,020
where the recent double murder happened?

405
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:41,890
The Bethesda PD took down your license number.

406
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:49,820
The Agency had to call in a lot of favors to close that investigation.

407
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,190
Your going over there jeopardized all that.

408
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,740
I wanted to see where it happened.

409
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:59,610
Why?

410
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:05,510
It upset me. I... I was upset by it.

411
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:13,140
Director Berenson has shown an unusual degree of confidence in you, Ms. Sherazi...

412
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,370
Entrusted you with matters of national importance.

413
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:16,830
I'm aware of that.

414
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,600
But your current state of mind makes your loyalty to him

415
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,500
and to the Agency a very live issue.

416
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:27,230
Tell the Director not to worry.

417
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:31,020
I'm fine. You can tell him yourself.

418
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,850
When you come into work tomorrow.

419
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:35,420
Yes.

420
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,830
Director Berenson?

421
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:55,140
Who is this Director Berenson?

422
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,300
My boss.

423
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:00,650
But he's no banker, is he?

424
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,160
No.

425
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,870
You went ahead, didn't you?

426
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,590
In spite of everything I said?

427
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:11,720
Baba, an attack happened. So what?

428
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,000
It's none of your business.

429
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,080
They needed Farsi speakers with experience in international finance.

430
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,540
I had to help.

431
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:22,530
And when the secret police find out who you work for, what then?

432
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:25,120
We have family still in Tehran!

433
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,100
Your uncle, his wife and children.

434
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,360
They will be added to the list of those to be hanged,

435
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,980
or shot!

436
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:44,030
I'm an American.

437
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,620
Target is still unknown, but presumed to be the man

438
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:55,310
who put the bomb in position in front of the HQ auditorium.

439
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:59,420
This is Paul Franklin, our stalking horse. Carrie?

440
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,340
Later this afternoon, I'll promote misinformation

441
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,960
to Mr. Franklin in the hopes that
he'll lead us to the bomber.

442
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,950
Our assumption is that after the meeting, he'll reach out for instructions.

443
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:13,300
To this man. Leland Bennett, one of the senior partners at the firm.

444
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,690
Which is why operation, from this moment forward,

445
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:20,230
requires a full complement of audio and visual surveillance on both subjects.

446
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:23,290
I don't have to tell you what catching this guy would mean.

447
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:27,400
In other words, stay small, stay cool, stay out of sight.

448
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,080
Okay, everybody. Game time.

449
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,170
You were right. Tell me.

450
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:12,790
They've connected your firm to the guy who detonated the bomb at Langley.

451
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:15,030
That's not possible. I'm telling you what I found out.

452
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:16,920
All right. Okay.

453
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:23,700
They're also under the impression that he's still here in the United States.

454
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,190
Is that true?

455
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:30,800
Answer the question, or so help me, I'll get up and you'll never see me again.

456
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:34,510
Take it easy, Carrie. Take a breath. No, don't patronize me.

457
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:40,000
Okay. It's true, he's here.

458
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,580
He's here where?

459
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:47,450
I'm assuming that means they haven't located him yet.

460
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:50,810
No, they haven't. Then exactly what do they have?

461
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:55,040
A warrant pending before a FISA judge, naming Leland Bennett a co-conspirator.

462
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:59,600
How soon before the warrant's active? A few days, at least.

463
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,850
They won't find anything. Bennett's clean. He works through a cutout.

464
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:03,800
You.

465
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:07,180
Just lay low and let me handle this.

466
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:11,660
You're the one who's been handling this, so excuse me if your assurance isn't very assuring.

467
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:40,880
They have a line on our friend. How'd they get onto him?

468
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,030
- No idea. - Well, find out.

469
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:46,530
It's a little late for that, don't you think? You sure it wasn't your mistake?

470
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:48,900
You sure it wasn't yours?

471
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:53,870
We were asked to provide material support to an American citizen with ties to the Regime.

472
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:57,280
There was no mention of his involvement in the bombing.

473
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,720
There was later. Yes, there was.

474
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,910
Well, we should've dealt with it then.

475
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:05,010
Maybe.

476
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:10,310
Do they know his name? No.

477
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:14,600
Then we're still okay. Do you want him out of the country?

478
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,760
Yes.

479
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,100
Preferably with a new identity.

480
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:20,890
How much do I tell him? I don't care.

481
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:22,520
Just get him out.

482
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:49,920
Franklin's sending a text. Talk to me.

483
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,950
It's an address and time.

484
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:54,350
Fairview Motel in Lynchburg, 0130.

485
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:58,670
Can we trace who he's sending it to? No, there must be an anonymizer on the device.

486
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,040
Don't worry, Carrie.

487
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:03,360
As long as we stick on Franklin, you'll get your bomber.

488
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,380
He's right.

489
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,210
We'll send a tactical team to the motel.

490
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:09,180
They'll arrest the target as soon as Franklin clears scene.

491
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:39,660
DC Department of Transportation is warning drivers to prepare for delays

492
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:43,200
due to street closures downtown Thursday through Saturday.

493
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,580
Officials say southbound 14th Street Northwest

494
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:49,930
will be closed between G Street and Pennsylvania.

495
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,640
Here's something.

496
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,610
It could be him.

497
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,670
Yeah, it is him. I've got a visual.

498
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:25,160
Copy that.

499
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:39,700
What's he doing? Just sitting there at the moment.

500
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,770
Bravo, do you have eyes on?

501
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:45,840
I'm looking down on the roof of his car.

502
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,980
No one moves until Franklin leaves site.

503
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,310
Copy that.

504
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,810
He's calling someone. We got it.

505
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,930
Are you here? Outside.

506
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,940
Flash your lights.

507
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:27,480
What room are you in? First tell me what's happening.

508
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:30,540
You may have been compromised.

509
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:34,050
How the hell did that happen? It happened.

510
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:37,900
What difference does it make how? Because I'm the one whose life is fucked.

511
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:41,960
If I hadn't gotten to you first, you'd spend the rest of your life living in a cage.

512
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:46,220
Try on some gratitude. You want your exfil package or not?

513
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:50,610
2-2-0. Be right up.

514
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:13,180
Shit. He's got a weapon.

515
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:13,970
What?

516
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,310
Now he's silencing it. Jesus, you seeing this?

517
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:20,750
He's got a gun! Bravo, can you confirm?

518
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:23,380
Negative. My view is obscured.

519
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:27,170
He's not exfiltrating the bomber, he's taking him out. You don't know that, Carrie.

520
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:29,270
Why else would he have a silencer?

521
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:33,270
She's right, Scott. I make the weapon.

522
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:35,960
I'm telling you Franklin's gonna kill that guy.

523
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:42,400
Listen to me. We just heard Bennett telling Franklin to get the guy out of the country.

524
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,430
Maybe Bennett changed his mind.

525
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:48,120
Either way, our priority is to keep Franklin in play.

526
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:51,980
So we just let him kill the bomber? If necessary, yes.

527
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,180
That wasn't the deal.

528
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,830
The bomber's the only way to prove that Brody's innocent.

529
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:59,530
And stopping Franklin now would blow your cover

530
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:01,890
and Javadi's back in Tehran.

531
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,060
You get that, right?

532
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:08,730
Until Franklin is clear, I want all teams to stand down.

533
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:10,680
All teams, acknowledge standing down.

534
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,470
Bravo here, standing down. Alpha Team standing down.

535
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:16,960
Carrie, acknowledge.

536
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:24,950
Carrie?

537
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:29,310
Carrie, what the fuck are you doing?

538
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:33,140
Carrie, go back to the van! Saul promised me this guy alive.

539
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,230
Saul's not calling the shots here.

540
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:37,530
He promised me, goddamn it. Get him on the phone!

541
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:39,840
There's no time. Turn around!

542
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,400
Carrie, turn around now, or we will stop you.

543
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:46,410
This is your last warning.

544
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:48,010
Listen to the man, Carrie.

545
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:55,160
Bravo, I am authorizing force. Take the shot. I repeat.

546
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,550
- Let me. - Take the shot. 

547
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,180
Carrie, this is Quinn.

548
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:05,500
Break away. I'm sorry. I can't.

549
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:09,020
You're fucking us, Carrie.
Months of work. Your work.

550
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:13,640
I don't care. Carrie, I will take the shot.

551
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:17,860
Window's closing, for Christ's sake!

552
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:46,050
He's in. Franklin is inside. Pick her up, for God's sake!

553
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:47,340
Go! Go!

554
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,420
Move it!

555
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,290
Jesus Christ.

556
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,420
What was the delay? I stopped her, didn't I?

557
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:27,060
Go with her. I'm watching Franklin.

558
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,920
Hospital's on the line. Tell 'em we got a gunshot wound to the upper left bicep,

559
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,950
significant bleeding, might have clipped an artery.

560
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:47,770
Hold on. You're gonna be all right.

561
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,400
Goddamn it!

562
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,950
Fuck! Fuck!

563
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,720
- Quinn... - Yeah?

564
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,020
Is the bomber dead?

565
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,700
- Yeah. - Fuck!

566
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,050
Fuck!

567
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,090
Something's going on.

568
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:09,480
- Yeah, you got shot. - Yeah, no shit!

569
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,750
You shot me!

570
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:16,580
No, I mean, something's going on. None of this... None of this makes sense.

571
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:19,270
Just breathe, okay? Deep breaths. Come on.

572
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,340
Come here.

573
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:27,570
Come closer.

574
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:30,350
Where the fuck is Saul?

575
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:44,880
You have a good flight? Yeah, fine.

576
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:47,970
Got me here.

577
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:55,590
All the money is there.

578
00:43:56,970 --> 00:44:01,460
Hey. This way. Wait here.

579
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:27,950
In another month, it's even hotter.

580
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:29,660
You won't believe.

581
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:33,250
Maybe I use the $10 million to put in an air conditioner.

582
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,640
There.

583
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:51,650
