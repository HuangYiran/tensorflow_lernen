1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:03,540
沒人相信愛麗絲
No one believed Alice

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,330
所說的仙境冒險
when she spoke of her adventures in Wonderland,

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:09,060
她是如何愛上精靈塞勒斯
of how she fell in love with a genie named Cyrus,

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,870
紅心王后又是如何拆散他們的
and how the Red Queen tore them apart.

5
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:11,890
不
No!

6
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:13,940
愛麗絲  她需要幫助
Alice. She needs help.

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,910
所以紅桃杰克和我帶她回了仙境
So the Knave of Hearts and I brought her back to Wonderland

8
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:18,280
尋找她的真愛
to search for her true love.

9
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,160
他在這里  我能感覺到
He's here. I can feel it.

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,350
有人想阻止她
There are those who will try to stop her.

11
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,340
讓那個女孩許下三個愿
What we want can't be accomplished

12
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,220
我們的目的才能達成
until the girl's made all her wishes.

13
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:28,200
但是愛麗絲的偉大冒險
But Alice's greatest adventure

14
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,640
剛剛開始
has just begun.

15
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:31,760
《仙境奇緣》前情提要
Previously in Wonderland...

16
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,090
這里怎么了
What happened here?

17
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,630
猛獸來襲過
Bandersnatch attacked.

18
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:36,000
-你殺了它嗎  -沒有
- Did you kill it? - No.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,460
是個年輕女子  和一個男人
It was a young woman and a man.

20
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,730
這個男人是誰
Who was this man?

21
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:41,270
她叫他"杰克"
She called him "Knave."

22
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,310
告訴我  杰克  安娜斯塔西婭是誰
So, tell me, Knave, who's Anastasia?

23
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,330
這是個心碎的故事
That is a tale of heartbreak.

24
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:48,430
我愛你  安娜斯塔西婭
I love you, Anastasia.

25
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,170
我愛你  威爾·史卡利
I love you, Will Scarlet.

26
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,080
阿格拉巴
多年前

27
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:13,910
男孩
Boy!

28
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:16,030
男孩  火要滅了
Boy, the fire's dying!

29
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:18,160
小崽子
Boy!

30
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,970
沒有煤了  我得去...
There was no coal left. I had to go--

31
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,550
不要找借口
No excuses!

32
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:28,650
我真該把你丟回那條發現你的陰溝
I should throw you back in the gutter where I found you!

33
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,240
不要  求你了
No! Please!

34
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,270
今晚又不想吃飯了是吧
Maybe another night without food

35
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,600
也許這樣能提醒你更好地干活兒
will remind you to be better prepared!

36
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,080
男孩  男孩
Boy! Boy!

37
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:08,030
轉過來
Turn away!

38
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,340
轉過來
Turn away!

39
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,600
男孩  她會讓我們原地燒起來的
Boy! She'll burn us where we stand!

40
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,310
抱歉來打擾您
I'm sorry to disturb you.

41
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,120
-我...  -你在集市干活
- I-- - You work at the market.

42
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:09,620
是的
Yes.

43
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,170
來敲我的門干什么
What are you doing at my door?

44
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,500
我想知道您能不能...
I was wondering if you--

45
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,150
我不是在問你想要什么
I'm not asking what you want.

46
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,330
我是在問你為什么來騷擾我
I'm asking why you'd disturb me.

47
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,270
你一定知道我的能耐
You must know what I can do to you.

48
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,500
對于我即將過上的生活來說
Death would be a kindness

49
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,590
死亡都算是仁慈了
compared to the life I have ahead of me.

50
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:24,830
我希望您能教我
I want you to teach me.

51
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,410
-教你  -黑魔法
- Teach you? - Dark magic.

52
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:29,320
這樣有一天  人們就會畏懼我
So that one day people will fear me,

53
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,500
就如他們畏懼你一樣
as they fear you.

54
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:31,500
不行
No.

55
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,500
求你了  我會替你干活  聽從你的吩咐
Please! I will work for you, do anything you want.

56
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,400
魔法可不只是用來對抗惡棍的
Magic is not something you use to simply fight off bullies.

57
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,930
-我不想...  -那你想怎樣
- That's not what-- - Then what is it?

58
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,530
我想報仇
I want revenge.

59
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,170
對誰
On who?

60
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,720
走吧  男孩  免得我...
Go away, boy, before I turn--

61
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,850
蘇丹王
The Sultan.

62
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,800
為什么像你這樣的人
And why would someone like you

63
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,110
會和蘇丹王扯上關系
have any concern with the Sultan?

64
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,660
因為  他是我父親
Because... he's my father.

65
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,610
是真的嗎
Is this true?

66
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,220
兩個人之間最重要的就是誠信
There's nothing more important between two people than honesty.

67
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,550
在我看來  你可不像皇族
To my eyes, you look nothing like royalty.

68
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,850
他拋棄了我
He abandoned me!

69
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,270
蘇丹王為什么要拋棄自己的親骨肉
Why would the Sultan abandon his own flesh and blood?

70
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,160
因為他說  我是他的私生子
Because, as he says, I am his bastard.

71
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,940
我恨他入骨
I hate him with the fire of a thousand suns!

72
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,350
總算
Finally...

73
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,320
你說實話了
honesty.

74
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,830
你叫什么  男孩
What's your name, boy?

75
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,920
賈法爾
Jafar.

76
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,290
好吧  賈法爾
Well, Jafar,

77
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:36,270
明天我們來看看你有什么本事
tomorrow we will begin to see what you can do.

78
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,940
美麗至極
Fabulous.

79
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,400
有樣東西叫前門  親愛的
There's a thing called the front door, darling.

80
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,290
你真該試一試
You really must try it sometime.

81
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,180
我覺得秘密見面
I thought making our interactions secret

82
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,600
更合你的意
would be more to your liking.

83
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,330
畢竟  保密是你的習慣
After all, secrets seem to be a habit of yours.

84
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,170
對對的  對對得  你們退下吧
Tweedles, begone, dears.

85
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,020
兩個人之間
There's nothing more important

86
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,550
最重要的
between two people

87
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,550
就是誠信
than honesty.

88
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,650
你不同意嗎
Wouldn't you agree?

89
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,380
什么事
What's this about?

90
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:33,130
你為什么不告訴我愛麗絲帶了朋友來仙境
Why didn't you tell me Alice brought a friend to Wonderland?

91
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,920
這個紅桃杰克
This Knave of Hearts.

92
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,500
因為這是無關緊要的小細節
'Cause it was an inconsequential detail.

93
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,940
他只不過是個懦弱的小偷
He's nothing but a cowardly thief.

94
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,960
我們無需擔心他
He's of very little concern to us.

95
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,920
其實  他造成了很大的麻煩
Actually, he's caused a great deal of trouble,

96
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,830
要我說  他的出現需要引起大大的重視
so I'd say his presence is of great concern.

97
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,110
你為什么帶他來
Why did you bring him?

98
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,640
因為事情不是
Because it wasn't quite as simple

99
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,270
給愛麗絲送一張邀請函那樣簡單
as sending Alice an invitation.

100
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,550
不然你一個人就能搞定了
Otherwise, you'd have done it yourself.

101
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:56,650
我需要愛麗絲信任的人
I needed someone that Alice trusted,

102
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,670
這個人剛好就是杰克
and that someone happened to be the Knave.

103
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,350
他起了作用
He served his purpose.

104
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:02,920
現在他的任務完成了
And now his purpose is done.

105
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,290
正是
Precisely.

106
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:05,660
那就沒問題了
Then there's no issue.

107
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,270
除掉他
Eliminate him.

108
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,620
把他驅逐出場
Remove him from the playing field.

109
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,760
去找紅心王后是個糟糕的主意  愛麗絲
Going after the Red Queen is a bad idea, Alice.

110
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,960
她偷走了塞勒斯的瓶子
She stole Cyrus' bottle.

111
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,080
唯一合理的解釋就是塞勒斯也在他手上
It only stands to reason that she has Cyrus as well.

112
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,650
所以你打算只身一人去追蹤她的軍隊嗎
So you're gonna go after the entire red army by yourself?

113
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:26,970
如果有必要的話
If that's what it takes.

114
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,070
-有更聰明的法子  -有嗎
- There's a smarter way to do this. - Is there now?

115
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,930
打出你手上有的牌  愛麗絲
Play the hand you've been dealt, Alice.

116
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:34,460
我看過你的牌  杰克  沒有幾張
I've seen your cards, Knave, and they're quite lacking.

117
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,550
正是虛張聲勢的時候
Which is exactly the time to start bluffing.

118
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,010
白兔...
Look, the White Rabbit--

119
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,280
他還不知道我們知道他在為王后效力
he has no idea we know he's working for the Queen.

120
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,250
我們得利用這一點
We need to use that to our advantage,

121
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,350
騙他告訴我們塞勒斯在哪里
fool him into telling us where Cyrus is.

122
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,350
或者我們可以提起他的雙腳
Or we could just pick him up by the feet,

123
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:50,250
把他掛在懸崖邊  直到他告訴我們所知的一切
dangle him over a cliff until he tells us everything he knows.

124
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,620
-你最好別這么一本正經的  -那邊
- We need to work on your poker face. - Over here!

125
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,720
-你聽到了嗎  -聽到了
- Did you hear that? - I did.

126
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,410
有人在跟蹤我們
Oh. Someone's following us.

127
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:00,440
聽這聲音  看來有不少人
By the sounds of things, I'd say several someones.

128
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:01,940
你認識他們嗎
Do you recognize them?

129
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,760
是毛蟲的人
They work for the Caterpillar.

130
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,440
-他們是搜捕隊  -我們有什么選擇
- They're collectors. - What are our options?

131
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,150
基本上我們可以去死  也可以逃跑
Well, basically, we could die, or we could run.

132
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,280
我不大喜歡第一種
I don't particularly care for the first one.

133
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,050
我也不喜歡  左邊還是右邊
Me, neither. Left or right?

134
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,120
-左邊  -好
- Left. - Okay.

135
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,450
他去哪里了
Where'd he go?!

136
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,060
快追他
After him!

137
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:21,650
他逃跑了
He's getting away!

138
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,700
他跑了
Getting away!

139
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,870
他們找的是我  我們該分頭行動
I'm the one they want. We should split up.

140
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,070
我們應該留下來戰斗
We should stay and fight.

141
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,450
更好的主意  你留在這里  我去引開他們
Oh, better idea-- you stay, I go.

142
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,110
這邊
Oi! Over here!

143
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,710
-威爾  不要  -我會沒事的
- Will, no! - I'll be fine.

144
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,470
我對這片森林了如指掌
I know these woods like the back of my hand--

145
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,030
-我沒事  拼圖森林見  -威爾
- I'm fine! Meet you back in Tulgey. - Will!

146
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:18,400
沒事  塞勒斯  好事多磨
It's okay, Cyrus. This is just a detour.

147
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,040
我們很快就能在一起了
I'll be with you soon.

148
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,420
行行好吧  先生
Please, sir.

149
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,760
-我好幾天沒吃飯了  -你該在犯錯前
- I haven't eaten for days. - You should have thought of that

150
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,000
就想到這一點
before you did whatever it is you did.

151
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,200
你說得對  我犯了十分嚴重的錯誤
You're right. I-I've made some terrible mistakes,

152
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,720
但我餓死了
but I'm starving.

153
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,360
你能不能分我一根骨頭  讓我嘗嘗味道
Could you even just spare a bone? Just a little taste?

154
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:50,120
看看上面還有沒有肉吧
See if you can find a morsel out of that.

155
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,980
我們被關在這里這么多天
In all the days we've been here together,

156
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,670
我從沒見過你像那樣祈求過任何東西
I've never seen you grovel like that for anything,

157
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,700
更別說是食物了
let alone food.

158
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,210
那是因為我對食物不感興趣
That's because I'm not interested in food.

159
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,310
你想要骨頭嗎
You wanted the bone?

160
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:16,540
這是一根如愿叉骨
It's a wishbone.

161
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:21,480
你打算許個愿逃離這里嗎
You're going to wish yourself out of this place?

162
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:23,540
類似吧
Something like that.

163
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,470
我們一定跟丟了他  你走這邊
We must have missed him! You go this way!

164
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,670
我走后面
I'll go the back!

165
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,910
沿著岸找
Look along the bank!

166
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,240
愛麗絲
Alice?

167
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,970
你真覺得
Did you really think

168
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:09,020
她有那個能耐  一個人搞定這些嗎
that she could do this all by herself?

169
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:10,890
該死
Bloody hell.

170
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,260
你好  威爾
Hello, Will.

171
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,870
阿格拉巴

172
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,760
我爬到巖壁下
And so... so I'm scrambling

173
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,220
試圖救他
down the rock face to try and save him,

174
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:36,290
這只蠢羊看見一叢灌木
when the stupid goat-- he sees a shrub.

175
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,250
還沒鷹嘴豆大
No bigger than a chickpea,

176
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,470
但他就是得吃  他走了一步
but he just has to eat it. He takes one step...

177
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,620
就摔了下去...
down right...

178
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:48,390
永遠也不能低估
One can never underestimate the stupidity

179
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,300
-山羊的愚蠢和吃貨精神啊  -是啊
- or the appetite of a goat. - Yes.

180
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:53,100
謝謝你救了他  艾其爾
Well, thanks for saving him, Akil--

181
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,410
盡管他不配
even if he didn't deserve it.

182
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:56,150
這是我的工作
Well, it is my job.

183
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,890
這袋酒是給你的
We have this wine for you

184
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,040
這是對你辛勞工作的獎賞
as a reward for your good work.

185
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:04,290
謝謝你  賈法爾
Oh... thank you, Jafar.

186
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,290
請你放心
May you rest easy.

187
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,380
不  還不是時候
No, not yet.

188
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,980
你什么時候才能讓我學習那本書里的咒語
When are you going to let me study the spells inside that book?

189
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,990
等你準備好的時候
When you're ready.

190
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,040
而現在你還沒準備好
Which, as of now, you're not.

191
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,960
不過  是時候該教你
It is, however, time for me to teach you

192
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,370
掩蔽咒語了
the masking spell,

193
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,430
你不是很想學嗎
which you've been so eager to learn.

194
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:39,680
你不是說過學不了那個咒語的嗎
But I thought you said we couldn't,

195
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,960
因為需要人的肝臟
because it requires a human liver.

196
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,360
確實如此  但你剛剛給弄到一個
It does, but you've just gotten us one.

197
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:48,970
你給艾其爾的那袋酒...被下過毒
The wine you gave Akil-- it was poisoned.

198
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,120
他馬上就要命喪黃泉了
He'll be dead any moment now.

199
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,170
艾其爾什么都沒做錯
But Akil did nothing!

200
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:56,540
確實如此
Quite right.

201
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,130
他是個好人
He's a fine man.

202
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:02,120
這是毒藥的解藥
And this is the antidote to the poison.

203
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,740
如果愿意  你把它可以交給他
If you wish, you can give it to him.

204
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,720
但如果你給了他  我們就沒有人肝了
But if you do, we won't have the liver.

205
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,760
你就不能學咒語了
And you won't be able to learn the spell.

206
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,730
你知道這是什么嗎  賈法爾
Do you know what this is, Jafar?

207
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,870
-一條蛇  -你知道為什么
- A serpent. - Do you know why

208
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,440
我在周圍擺滿這種生物的裝飾嗎
I surrounded myself with such creatures?

209
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,340
不知道
No.

210
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,100
因為它們其中蘊藏的真諦
It is because of their true essence.

211
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,650
它們最重要的能力
Their most important quality--

212
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,210
就是必要之時
that when they need to,

213
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,050
可以蛻皮  重獲新生
they shed their skin and are reborn.

214
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:33,930
這就是你要做的  賈法爾
And that is what you need to do, Jafar.

215
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,980
放任無辜的人死去嗎
By letting an innocent die?

216
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,930
是向我展示
By showing me

217
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,830
你會不惜一切代價
that you're willing to do whatever's necessary

218
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,290
爭取你想要的東西
to get what you want.

219
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,510
你會嗎
Are you?

220
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,590
還是說  你還是那個
Or are you still just that little boy

221
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:48,920
來到我門前的
who came to my door,

222
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,880
僅有一腔怒火的小男孩
full of anger but little else?

223
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,530
現在我們知道了
Well, now we know.

224
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,400
祝賀你  賈法爾
Congratulations, Jafar.

225
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,720
你重獲新生了
You are reborn.

226
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:35,550
大人
Sire?

227
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,510
她抓到他了
She's got him--

228
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,690
紅桃杰克
the knave of hearts.

229
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,790
他們正押送他回宮殿
They're on their way back to the palace.

230
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,050
好極了
Excellent.

231
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,480
還有什么事要我為您效勞嗎
Is there anything else I can do for you?

232
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,560
不了  下面的事就交給我吧
No. I shall take it from here.

233
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:52,510
記得提醒我獎賞你的好表現
Remind me to reward you for your good work.

234
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,290
當然
Of course.

235
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:11,070
你不該回仙境來的  威爾
You should never have come back to wonderland, Will.

236
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,010
你的女朋友愛麗絲給了你什么
So what did your girlfriend Alice offer you

237
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:18,870
這么吸引你  甚至戰勝了你的生存本能
that was enticing enough for you to overcome your survival instincts, hmm?

238
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,280
她不是我的女朋友
She's not me girlfriend.

239
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,290
我可不喜歡善良又普通的女人
I'm clearly not attracted to nice, normal women.

240
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,540
你這幾年都在忙什么呢  威爾
What have you been up to all these years, Will?

241
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:28,060
還在乞討  借錢  偷竊嗎
Still begging, borrowing, and stealing?

242
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,510
真了解我
Bloody hell.

243
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:32,220
也許你能騙過所有人
Maybe you've fooled all these people

244
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,290
讓他們相信你是什么王后
into believing you're some kind of queen...

245
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,070
但我知道你的真實身份
but I know who you really are...

246
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:38,780
安娜斯塔西婭
Anastasia.

247
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,240
你從來不知道什么時候該消停  是吧  威爾
You never did know when to stop fighting, did you, Will?

248
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,800
你打算把我關在這多久
How long are you gonna keep me in here?

249
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,480
不如先關一輩子
How about we start with forever

250
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,290
剩下的事以后再說
and work our way back from there?

251
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,020
他不在里面
He's not in there.

252
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,560
誰不在里面
Who's not in there?

253
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,030
你在找杰克  對嗎
You're looking for the knave, right?

254
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:16,900
他不在里面
He ain't in there.

255
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,880
你怎么知道
How do you know?

256
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,120
如果他在里面
'Cause if he was,

257
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,020
我就會在里面收取報酬了
I'd be inside collecting a reward.

258
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:24,160
你也是在追捕隊的
You're one of those collectors

259
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,640
你也在找他
that was chasing him.

260
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:28,510
而且很不幸  還沒抓到他
And, unfortunately, not the one catching him.

261
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,530
等等  有人抓到他了嗎
Wait. Did someone catch him?

262
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,840
我可以告訴你  但是你看啊
I could tell ya. But, you see, I got this thing

263
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,170
有人用劍指著我的時候
where it's hard for me to be straight with people

264
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:35,650
我很難坦言相告
pointing swords at me.

265
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:39,930
紅心王后抓到他了
The Red Queen got him.

266
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,850
-你確定嗎  -確定
- Are you quite sure? - Oh, yeah.

267
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:44,360
這些傷就是證據
I got the bruises to prove it.

268
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,070
我知道我該怎么做了
Well, I know what I have to do.

269
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:47,850
謝謝你  小姐...
Thank you, miss...

270
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:48,910
伊麗莎白
Elizabeth.

271
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,160
但大多數人叫我麗莎爾
But most people call me Lizard.

272
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,490
我叫愛麗絲
Alice.

273
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,020
祝我好運吧
Wish me luck.

274
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,370
等等  你要去追他嗎
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. You going after him?

275
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:58,020
不  是"她"
No. I'm going after her.

276
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,820
紅心王后  你一個人是進不去的
The Red Queen? You can't go in there by yourself.

277
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,640
為什么每個人都這么說
Why does everybody keep telling me that?

278
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,850
因為這是事實
Maybe 'cause it's true.

279
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:08,110
好吧  管他的  我和你一起去
Fine. Hell with it. I'm coming with you.

280
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:10,470
我好像沒請你這么做
I'm quite certain I didn't ask you to.

281
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,560
不管怎樣
Whatever.

282
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,590
杰克欠我的  而且死人可不能還債
The Knave owes me, and, uh, dead men can't pay debts.

283
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,520
恭喜你  陛下
Congratulations, majesty.

284
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,570
恭喜什么
About what?

285
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:41,420
這么快就抓到了杰克
Such a quick capture of the knave.

286
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,930
消息傳得真快
News travels fast.

287
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,670
確實如此
Yes, it does, doesn't it?

288
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,920
我只是想問  為什么他還活著
But I just have to ask, why is he still breathing?

289
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,350
-你說誰  -杰克
- Pardon? - The Knave.

290
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,290
我知道他被你關在地牢里
I understand he's locked in your dungeon.

291
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:54,120
我只是好奇為什么
I was just curious as to why that is.

292
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,820
我們想要除掉他  現在他已經被除掉了
We wanted him "Removed." He's "Removed."

293
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,570
但把他關在暗無天日的地牢
But he's no use to us locked away

294
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,160
對我們毫無用處
where no one can see him.

295
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,880
你想讓我把他綁起來示眾嗎  沒問題
You want me to put him outside in the gallows? Fine--

296
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,330
我要你砍下他的頭
I want you to put his head on the chopping block!

297
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:09,440
公開處決
A public execution

298
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,280
這樣  每個人都會看到幫助愛麗絲的下場
So everyone will see the price for helping Alice in wonderland.

299
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:17,000
賈法爾  你難道不知道
Did it ever occur to you, Jafar,

300
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,350
對我們來說  讓他活著比死了更有用
that he might be more useful to us alive than dead?

301
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:22,360
對我們更有用
More use to us...

302
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:25,830
還是對你更有用
or more use to you?

303
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,440
你在暗示什么嗎
Do you have something to say?

304
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,710
你就沒事要告訴我嗎
Do you?

305
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,170
你先是忘了告訴我杰克在幫助愛麗絲
First you forget to tell me this knave was helping Alice,

306
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:36,160
現在你又不愿殺了他
now you seem reluctant to kill him.

307
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,080
這讓我不禁好奇
It makes me wonder if

308
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,800
你的不作為是不是另有隱情
perhaps there's a reason for your inaction.

309
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,370
是時候看看你是不是一個
It's time to find out if you're a woman

310
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,280
為得到想要的東西
who's prepared to do whatever it takes

311
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,810
可以不惜一切代價的女人
to get what she wants,

312
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:47,280
還是只是一個
or just a little girl

313
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:50,530
除了偷來的王冠  而一無所有的小女孩
with a stolen crown and nothing else.

314
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:53,110
這一次  讓我看清楚
Let me be clear this time.

315
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,670
殺了他
Kill him.

316
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:20,580
這本書包含了世間所有
This book contains all the world's wisdom

317
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,310
關于精靈的知識
about genies.

318
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,130
精靈
Genies?

319
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:32,270
這就是你一直以來拒絕與我分享的秘密
That's what you've refused to share with me all this time?

320
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,870
我得等到你準備好
Well, I had to wait until you were ready.

321
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,710
現在你準備好了
And you are.

322
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:41,610
這本書里的咒語
Inside these pages is a spell

323
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,620
只有擁有三只精靈的力量
that only the power of the three genies

324
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,110
才能施放
will allow us to cast.

325
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,150
這個咒語非常強大  即使是我
A spell so powerful that even I,

326
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:50,230
用上我所有的魔力  也無法獨自施展
with all my magic, could not attempt alone.

327
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,390
但現在我有了一個搭檔
But now that I have a partner...

328
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,210
什么樣的咒語會這么難
What kind of spell could be so difficult

329
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,880
需要我們兩個才能進行
that it requires both of us?

330
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,670
如果成功了
One that, if we succeed,

331
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,150
我們將成為世界上最強大的巫師
will make us the most powerful sorcerers the world has ever known.

332
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,380
我們將能改變魔法規則
We will be able to change the very laws of magic.

333
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,100
一旦做到這一點
And once we do that...

334
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,940
一切都唾手可得
all we desire will be at our fingertips.

335
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,120
你愿意將這一切與我分享
And you wish to share this with me?

336
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,960
你的慷慨
Your generosity--

337
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,000
我不知道該如何報答
I don't know how I could ever repay it.

338
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,400
我等待了無數歲月
I have waited many, many years

339
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,990
尋找值得這一切的人  賈法爾
to find someone worthy of this, Jafar.

340
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:37,750
就像你等待了那么多年
Just as you have waited years to seek your revenge

341
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:40,190
去向拋棄你的父親
not only on your father who cast you out,

342
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,560
和所有那些輕視你
but on all those who ever... belittled you...

343
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,640
或懷疑你的人復仇
or doubted you.

344
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,830
沒人對我這么友善過
No one has ever shown me such kindness.

345
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,380
也沒有人
No one...

346
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,710
像我這樣深愛你
has ever loved you like I do.

347
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:33,120
就快成功了
Almost there.

348
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:34,780
你在做什么
What are you doing?

349
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,160
-你說什么  -舉起你的雙手
- Excuse me? - Show me your hands.

350
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:42,790
我不懂
I don't understand.

351
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:44,910
我看到你手里拿著東西
You're holding something. I saw it.

352
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,700
舉起你的雙手
Show me your hands.

353
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:56,580
很好
All right.

354
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,820
很鋒利
Sharp.

355
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,630
磨了很長時間吧
Must have taken you a long time.

356
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,390
王后的宮殿是個陷阱密布的地方
The queen's palace is a tricky place.

357
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,380
我知道  我
I know. I, uh,

358
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,510
每半年左右就去雙胞胎兄弟那扒一次
pickpocket the tweedles every six months or so.

359
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,970
你從未被逮到嗎
And you never got caught?

360
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:43,310
名師出高徒嘛
Learned from the best.

361
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,890
-是紅桃杰克嗎  -當然了
- The Knave? - Of course.

362
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,120
你這么做  不是為了
You're not doing this for repayment

363
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,840
要追回債務吧
of a financial debt, are you?

364
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,200
我當時在街上
I was on the streets.

365
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:59,960
他收留了我  給我一瓦遮頭
He took me in, gave me a place to sleep.

366
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,480
教會了我這一身本領
Taught me everything I know.

367
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,490
很遺憾聽到這些
Well, sorry to hear that.

368
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:05,130
走吧  我知道他有時很難相處
Come on, I know he can be difficult,

369
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,630
可是他心地善良  這要謝謝你了
but his heart's in the right place, thanks to you.

370
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:10,040
聽起來你倆曾是親密好友
Sounds like you two were close friends.

371
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,400
除非  等等  你倆是否
Unless... wait, were you two...

372
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,430
不   不是
No. Uh, no.

373
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,580
我絕對不會
I mean... I would never...

374
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:20,010
威爾和我  我們只是一起跑路
Will and I-- we just ran together.

375
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:21,300
一起偷東西
You know, stealing.

376
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,640
有時是為了毛蟲
Sometimes for the Caterpillar, and...

377
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,460
有時只是為了好玩
sometimes just for fun.

378
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:27,500
你們以搶劫他人為樂嗎
You'd rob people for fun?

379
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,840
自從安娜斯塔西婭的事情之后
Will kind of went through a dark period

380
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,870
威爾經歷了一段黑暗的時期
after the whole Anastasia thing.

381
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:33,240
又是這個  安娜斯塔西婭
There's that name again-- Anastasia.

382
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,350
這個女孩到底是何方神圣
Who is this girl?

383
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,610
從未見過  但不管她是誰
Never met her, but whoever she is,

384
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:37,890
她都徹底毀了他
she completely wrecked him.

385
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,960
人們都說威爾離開仙境是因為他債臺高筑
Everyone says Will left Wonderland 'cause of his debts,

386
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,350
但我并不這么看
but I don't think so.

387
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,410
這地方令他想起她
This place reminded him of her.

388
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:47,000
我想他只是再也承受不了了
I think he just couldn't take it anymore.

389
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,050
你來這里干嘛
What are you doing here?

390
00:22:58,050 --> 00:22:59,640
我以為成為王后的好處
I thought the whole point of becoming queen

391
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,790
就是再也不必親自動手做那些骯臟的勾當了
was that so you never had to get your hands dirty again.

392
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:06,320
威爾  那些勾搭還是我做
Will, I still get my hands dirty.

393
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,120
唯一不同的是  現在我可以讓別人
The only difference is now I get people

394
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,590
為我動手處理
to clean them off for me.

395
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,500
這么說你只是來幸災樂禍的嗎
So you've just come to gloat?

396
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,020
提醒你自己  多年以前
Remind yourself that you did the right thing

397
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,480
-所做的事都是正確的嗎  這不是原因
- all those years ago? - That's not why.

398
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:15,320
那你究竟為什么來
Then why?

399
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,180
我是來告訴你過幾分鐘后
I came to tell you that in a few minutes,

400
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,280
白兔會過來告訴你
the white rabbit will be here with instructions

401
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,830
離開仙境的路
to take you out of Wonderland

402
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,540
帶你回到他發現你的地方
and back to where he found you.

403
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:28,200
-是嗎  -威爾  我是說真的
- Will he now? - Will, I'm serious.

404
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,490
你這樣是為了要我逃跑  再當場逮住我嗎
Is this the part where you get to catch me escaping?

405
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,640
然后給自己一個殺我的借口嗎
Give you an excuse to kill me?

406
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,980
威爾  我不需要找借口來殺你
Will, I don't need an excuse to kill you.

407
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,110
我需要一個不用殺你的借口
I need an excuse not to kill you.

408
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,730
與我有關聯的人想要你死
I'm involved with people who want you dead.

409
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,640
從何時起  你開始照他人的意志來行事了
Since when did you do what anyone told ya?

410
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:44,430
不是
No.

411
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,380
你還不明白嗎
No, you don't understand.

412
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,050
我是想要彌補你
I'm trying to make it up to you.

413
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:50,670
安娜  我不需要你的同情
I don't need your pity, Anna.

414
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:53,440
事實上你需要  因為我不同情你的話
Actually, you do, because without my pity,

415
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,730
你將會失去很多東西  包括你的腦袋
you won't have a lot of things, including your head!

416
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:58,200
所以等兔子來的時候
So when the Rabbit gets here--

417
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,230
我不會走的
I'm not going.

418
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,350
威爾  不要犯傻了
Oh, don't be a fool now, Will.

419
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,700
如果我是傻子  那也是因為你
If I'm a fool, it's only because you made me one.

420
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,700
你是個可怕的人
You're a terrible person

421
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,780
對人心狠手辣
who does terrible things to people.

422
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:10,080
但是我認為有一件事  就連你也不會做
But I think there's one thing even you won't do.

423
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:11,460
是什么
What's that?

424
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:12,840
殺了我
Kill me.

425
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,330
事實上  我打賭你不敢殺我
In fact, I dare you to kill me.

426
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,410
因為在我看來  你沒這個膽量
Because personally, I don't think you've got it in ya.

427
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,400
你應該比任何人都清楚
You should know better than anyone

428
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,080
最能保證我動手的方法
that the surest way to make me do something

429
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,290
就是告訴我  我做不到
is to tell me that I can't.

430
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,220
你是做不到
You can't.

431
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:49,100
打擾一下
Excuse me.

432
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,840
發生什么事了
What's going on here?

433
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,460
馬上會有公開行刑
There's gonna be an execution.

434
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,760
請讓讓
Excuse me?

435
00:24:58,850 --> 00:24:59,750
對不起
Pardon me?

436
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,680
刀劍不長眼
I have a blade.

437
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,680
-上面寫了什么  -紅桃杰克
- What's it say? - The Knave.

438
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,010
他們要處決他
They're executing him...

439
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,970
今日公開處決
紅桃杰克

440
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,390
就在今天
Today.

441
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,400
那輛投石車是用來做什么的
What's the Catapult for?

442
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:37,370
如果搶到頭  就有免費的晚餐
If you catch the head, you get a free dinner.

443
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:40,400
-射好點  -讓他的腦袋飛起來
- Make it a good one! - Make his head fly.

444
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,810
射得真棒
That was a beauty!

445
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,400
依舊如此野蠻
Still barbaric as ever.

446
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,080
為王后歡呼
Hail the queen!

447
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,190
我們得救威爾
We have to save Will.

448
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:05,250
你有辦法嗎  貌似已經希望全無了
You have an idea? 'Cause this is looking bleak.

449
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:07,110
砍掉他的腦袋
Off with his head!

450
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,940
事實上  我有辦法
As a matter of fact, I do.

451
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,630
殺掉紅桃杰克
Kill the Knave!

452
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,060
你的笑容跑哪去了
Now where's that smile?

453
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,310
你知道王后的樣兒
You know the one.

454
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:27,630
一看到人頭落地就會喜笑顏開
The one that loves a good beheading.

455
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,650
這不就是嘛
It's right here.

456
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,650
有什么問題嗎  合作伙伴
Anything wrong... partner?

457
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:40,470
沒問題  只是你經常干涉我處理事務
No. Just your constantly interfering with my affairs.

458
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,510
我認為是你的事務
I think it's your affairs

459
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:44,170
在讓我神煩
that are interfering with me.

460
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,990
如果你有話要說
If you've got something to say,

461
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,760
就快點說
spit it out.

462
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:51,550
愛麗絲來了
Alice is here.

463
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:53,440
在庭院里
In the courtyard.

464
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:55,040
叫守衛抓住她
Well, have the guards seize her.

465
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,260
我們不需要她來搞破壞
We don't need her ruining things--

466
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,990
不  只要
No. Just...

467
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:00,290
只要盯住她就行了
Just keep an eye on her.

468
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:02,890
是時候讓我們看看  她為了達到目的
It's time for us to see how far she's willing to go

469
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,390
愿意付出多大的代價
to get what she wants.

470
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,090
我們打烊了
We are closed.

471
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,720
我不是來喝酒的
I'm not here for a drink.

472
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:18,700
如果來尋歡  請上樓吧
If it's women you seek, then that's upstairs.

473
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,880
我要你手里的精靈
I want the genie in your possession.

474
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:25,440
我沒有精靈
I don't have a genie--

475
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,140
不必否認了
Don't bother denying it.

476
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:29,250
謠言傳千里
Rumors travel great distances, sir,

477
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,480
特別是那些關于魔法的流言
When magic is involved.

478
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:34,310
很抱歉  讓你千里迢迢地撲了個空
I'm sorry you've come so far for nothing.

479
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:37,110
我不準備把瓶子交出去
I'm not ready to pass on the bottle.

480
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,640
我還有一個未許的愿望
I still have one more wish to make,

481
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:42,670
我要留著適當的時候使用
and I'm saving it for just the right thing.

482
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,370
而且我不著急
And I'm in no hurry.

483
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:45,320
可是我著急
But I am.

484
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:49,610
你是誰
Who are you?

485
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:50,960
我將是你最后看到的人
The last person you will ever see

486
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:52,620
除非你交出我想要的東西
unless you give me what I want.

487
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,340
你瞧
You see...

488
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:58,080
我會帶著精靈離開這里
I will be leaving here with the genie.

489
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,980
但問題是  你還能活著離開這里嗎
The question is, will you be leaving here at all?

490
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,200
如果你對精靈如此感興趣
If you are so interested in genies,

491
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,040
那你就該知道你不能殺了我
then you know you can't kill me.

492
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:11,580
成為他的新主人的唯一方法就是
The only way for you to become his new master

493
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:14,080
讓我許下我所有的愿望
is for me to make all of my wishes.

494
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:22,370
說得對
You're right.

495
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,180
我是不能殺你
I can't kill you.

496
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,640
但我可以讓你痛不欲生
But I can inflict so much pain,

497
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,600
似乎沒有任何愿望值得你付出如此的代價
no wish will ever seem worth it.

498
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,190
我許愿你無法傷害到我
I wish that you can do me no harm.

499
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:45,300
如您所愿
As wishes go,

500
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,170
您真是我見過的最識時務的許愿人
that's one of the wiser ones I've heard.

501
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,810
雜種  滾回地溝里去吧
Go back to the gutter, you bastard.

502
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,270
你說什么
What did you say?

503
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,670
你聽到了
You heard me.

504
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,090
是啊  但我想再聽你說一次
Perhaps I did, but I'd like to hear you say it again.

505
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:09,970
你忘記我許下的愿望了嗎
Did you forget about my wish?

506
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:12,060
你再也傷害不了我了
You can't hurt me anymore.

507
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,360
的確是  但是她可以
True, but she can.

508
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:23,950
求你
Please...

509
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,570
不要殺我  求求你
don't kill me, I beg you.

510
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:28,840
你會明白  有些事比死亡更痛苦
I think you'll find there are far worse things than death.

511
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:38,820
現在我們還差一個瓶子了
We're now one bottle away.

512
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,220
敬我們倆
To us.

513
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,900
敬我們倆
To us.

514
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,740
把紅心杰克帶上來
Bring on the Knave!

515
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,840
殺了他
Kill him!

516
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:04,000
殺了這個叛徒  殺了紅心杰克
Kill the traitor! Kill the Knave!

517
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,070
現在就砍下他的腦袋
Off with his head now!

518
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,960
他就該去死
He deserves to die!

519
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:15,250
讓他付出代價
Make him pay!

520
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:17,710
我要看著他的頭滾下來
I want to see his head roll!

521
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,340
冷靜點
Be still.

522
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:24,970
你們從不清掃這里嗎
Don't you ever clean these things?

523
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,780
殺了這個叛徒
Kill the traitor!

524
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:36,890
-殺了他  -馬上殺了他
- Kill him now! - Come on!

525
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,410
這就對了  殺了他
That's it, kill him!

526
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:44,560
讓他好好受受折磨
Make him suffer!

527
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:45,970
讓他人頭落地
Off with his head!

528
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,090
出什么事了
What's happening?

529
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:01,010
老天啊
Bloody hell.

530
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,180
阻止他們
Stop them!

531
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,040
攔住他們
Stop them!

532
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:05,740
他們想要逃跑
They're trying to escape!

533
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,590
別讓他們跑了
Don't let them get away!

534
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,620
我還以為我死定了
I thought I was bolluxed.

535
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:35,210
如果那個行刑者再高六英寸的話
If that executioner had been 6 inches taller,

536
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:36,090
你就真死定了
You would have been.

537
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:37,840
好吧
All right.

538
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,940
我們究竟要怎么離開這里
How the bloody hell do we get out of here?

539
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:42,360
來吧  走這邊
Come on. This way.

540
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,750
麗莎爾  你嚇了他一大跳
Lizard, you knocked him out cold.

541
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:45,780
你們都在想些什么啊
What were you thinking?

542
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,710
你們可能都會送命
You could have both been killed.

543
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:50,030
一句"謝謝"就好了
A simple "Thank you" would suffice.

544
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:51,220
謝謝
Thank you.

545
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:53,870
還有你  lizard
You, too, lizard.

546
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,380
走右邊  跟我來
To the right! Follow me!

547
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,340
有人來了
We got company.

548
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,230
-最好趕緊走  -在這里  快來
- We better go. - Over here! Come on!

549
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,830
他們在迷宮里
They're in the maze!

550
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,580
你好  愛麗絲
Hello, Alice.

551
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,930
-這家伙是誰啊  -晚點再跟你解釋
- Who the hell is that? - I'll tell you later.

552
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,140
我們得先逃走
We need to get out of here--

553
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,250
這么快就要走了嗎
Leaving so soon?

554
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,640
我來掩護  你們快逃
I'll distract 'em. You guys run.

555
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,490
麗茲  不要
Liz, no!

556
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,080
Lizard
Lizard!

557
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,850
我想是正式見面的時候了  我叫...
I suppose it's time we met. My name is--

558
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:38,350
我知道你是誰  賈法爾
I know who you are, Jafar.

559
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,630
塞勒斯把你的一切都告訴我了
Cyrus has told me all about you.

560
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:42,670
有意思
Interesting.

561
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:45,860
我今天也算對你有所了解了  愛麗絲
It seems I've learned a little bit about you today as well, Alice.

562
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:46,990
你了解我什么了
And what was that?

563
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:49,410
你愿意為了朋友而做任何事
That you're willing to do anything for a friend.

564
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:51,870
真讓人感動
Quite touching, actually.

565
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:00,600
停下  他什么也沒做
Stop it! He's done nothing!

566
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:06,760
拜托了  求你
Please, I beg you!

567
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:09,080
你不需要求我  愛麗絲
You don't have to beg, Alice.

568
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,070
許愿就行了
Just wish.

569
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,240
安娜斯塔西婭
Anastasia...

570
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:18,210
快許愿  愛麗絲
Just make a bloody wish, Alice!

571
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:23,170
我許愿  紅桃杰克一死
I wish if the Knave of Hearts dies...

572
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,090
我也會立刻死去
then I die!

573
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:31,910
不要  愛麗絲
Alice, no.

574
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:43,720
干得好  愛麗絲  干得好
Well played, alice. Well played.

575
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:45,880
你已經許下一個愿望了  還剩下兩個
That's one wish down, and two to go.

576
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,540
除非你殺了我
You'll have to kill me first.

577
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:50,050
等等
Oh, wait.

578
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,030
你還不能殺我  對吧
You can't now, can you? True.

579
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:55,300
沒錯  我需要你活著  這樣才能許愿
True. I need you alive to make your wishes.

580
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:57,900
但我不需要你完好無損
But I don't need you whole.

581
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:01,530
愛麗絲
Alice...

582
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,530
你只需要許愿讓我住手
All you have to do is wish for me to stop,

583
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:14,980
所有這些痛楚就會停止了
And the pain will go away.

584
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,380
你只需要付出說幾個字的代價
Such sweet relief can be yours

585
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,540
就可以得到無比甜蜜的解放
for the bargain price of a few words.

586
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:25,450
我絕不會讓塞勒斯任你擺布
I will never put Cyrus at your mercy.

587
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,830
你確定嗎
Are you sure about that?

588
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,370
你只能殺了我  賈法爾
You'll have to kill me, Jafar,

589
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:40,210
因為我永遠不會為你而許愿
'cause I will never, ever wish for you.

590
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:56,560
愛麗絲  你還好嗎
Alice... are you all right?

591
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:57,340
還好
Yes.

592
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,590
走吧
Come on.

593
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:00,520
趁我們還能動  趕緊離開這里
Let's get out of here while we still can.

594
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:06,170
我的確不能殺了你們中的任何一個
While it's true I might not be able to kill either of you,

595
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,100
但你得明白  愛麗絲
I think you'll find, Alice,

596
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,290
有些事比死亡更可怕
There are worse things than death.

597
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:14,700
我動不了了
Can't move.

598
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:15,900
這是怎么了
What's happening?

599
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,430
愛麗絲  這是怎么了
Alice, what's happening?

600
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:20,140
住手  讓他住手
Stop him. Make him stop.

601
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,980
你是對的  王后陛下
You were right, your majesty.

602
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:35,460
讓他活著的確比讓他死了更有用
He was more useful alive than dead.

603
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:40,340
你不會為了自己而許愿  愛麗絲
So you won't use your wishes to help yourself, Alice?

604
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:44,830
那么我就會摧毀所有你在乎的
Then I will keep destroying all the things you care about,

605
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:46,850
傷害所有你愛的人
hurting all the people you love...

606
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,770
直到你別無他選
until you have no other choice.

607
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:53,760
因為你有軟肋  愛麗絲
Because you have a weakness, Alice.

608
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,190
今天我已經看出來了
I've seen it today.

609
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,990
你有一顆心
You have a heart.

610
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:00,510
相信我  我會好好利用這一點的
And trust me, I shall exploit it.

611
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:09,930
幫幫他
Help him.

612
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:13,110
我為什么要幫他  親愛的
Why would I want to do that, darling?

613
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,480
因為你在乎他
Because you care.

614
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:21,090
你不了解我
You don't know me.

615
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:22,000
不  我了解你
Yes, I do...

616
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,730
安娜斯塔西婭
Anastasia.

617
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,600
你能夠幫助他
You can help him.

618
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,010
能幫助他的是你  用你的愿望
You can help him. Wish!

619
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,000
你要是再這樣做  親愛的  我就...
You keep on doing that, dear, and--

620
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,620
怎樣  殺了我  你不能
What? You'll kill me? You can't.

621
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:40,190
你以為你們占盡優勢  但事實并非如此
You think you have the advantage, but you don't.

622
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:42,810
我的朋友可沒有被變成石頭
I'm not the one whose friend has turned to stone

623
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,150
我的愛人也沒有被監禁
And whose love is in my possession.

624
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:49,310
現在  你可以繼續表現得像
Now... you can carry on behaving like the little girl

625
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:51,360
我們剛見面時的那個小女孩一樣
you were when we very first met.

626
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,980
你也可以趕緊長大
Or you can grow up.

627
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,120
做點符合常理的事情
And do what common sense compels you to do.

628
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:58,370
反正你知道在哪里可以找到我
Either way, you know where to find me.

629
00:36:58,370 --> 00:37:01,810
你不把我關進監牢  折磨我嗎
You're not... going to put me in prison, torture me?

630
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:04,070
若我不遵照你的命令  就讓我把牢底坐穿
Let me rot until I do your bidding?

631
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:06,730
你還沒看出來嗎  親愛的
Don't you see, darling?

632
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:10,580
你已經在監牢里了
You are in prison.

633
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,680
不然你以為仙境是什么
What do you think wonderland is?

634
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:19,270
你是我的囊中之物  愛麗絲
You're mine, Alice.

635
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,660
從現在起  事情只會變得更糟
And from now on, things are only going to get worse.

636
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,130
直到你完成了自己的任務
Until you do what you must.

637
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,200
許完愿望
Wish.

638
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:13,350
相信你已經知道了
I'm sure you already know,

639
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:17,590
你的摯愛今天已許下了她的第一個愿望
But your precious love used her wish today.

640
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,920
你知道這意味著什么
I think you know what that means.

641
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:22,800
這個籠子很快就會沒用了
Soon the cage won't be necessary,

642
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,400
因為你很快就會回到你的歸屬地
Because you'll be back where you belong--

643
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,940
回到你的瓶子里
In your bottle.

644
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:48,790
發生什么好事了
What's the occasion?

645
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:50,710
我聽到了傳言
I've heard a rumor.

646
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:53,130
關于第三個精靈嗎
The third genie?

647
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:56,570
他就在阿格拉巴
Right here in agrabah.

648
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,790
為了前兩個精靈  我們長途跋涉
With how far we've traveled to get the others,

649
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:04,490
如今這個可真是讓人愉快
that would be a welcome change.

650
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:15,540
我很自信  我很快就會得到第三個精靈
I'm confident I will soon have the third genie,

651
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:18,590
然后我就可以準備好施咒了
And then I'll be ready to begin the spell.

652
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:21,120
你是說我們就可以準備好施咒了
You mean we will be ready to begin the spell.

653
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,170
賈法爾
Jafar?

654
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:33,380
還記得嗎  很久以前
Do you remember a long time ago,

655
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:36,140
你問過我  為了得到所求之物愿意付出什么
you asked me what I was willing to do in order to get what I want?

656
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:40,330
你做了什么
What have you done?

657
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:44,200
這是一劑可以攫取你魔力的魔藥
It's a potion to steal your magical essence.

658
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,990
不過估計你早就知道
But then again, you probably know that.

659
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:49,390
這正是你的書中所記錄的
It was in your book.

660
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:51,410
你是愛我的
You loved me.

661
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:53,970
不
No.

662
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,640
是你愛著我
You loved me.

663
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,880
求你  賈法爾  別這樣
Please, Jafar. Don't do this.

664
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:03,010
你一個人是完成不了這個咒語的
You know you can't complete the spell on your own.

665
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:07,850
沒有一個人可以單獨施展這么強大的力量
No one person can achieve that much power alone.

666
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:09,220
我不是一個人
I won't be alone.

667
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:11,940
我有你
I'll have you...

668
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:13,990
還有你的魔力
and your magic.

669
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:16,580
現在是時候
Now it's time for you,

670
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:19,350
像你喜愛的毒蛇那樣
like the serpent you so admire...

671
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:22,900
蛻去舊皮了
to shed your skin.

672
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:52,360
恭喜你  阿瑪拉
Congratulations, Amara.

673
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:56,260
你已經重生了
You are reborn.

674
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:28,690
你還有一半
You have the other half.

675
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:32,600
這是個傳說  你聽過關于如愿骨的傳說嗎
It's a myth, what you've heard about wishbones--

676
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,130
當如愿骨被一分為二時
That when you break them,

677
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:39,620
手上拿著較大那一半者將得以實現愿望
whoever has the larger half gets a wish.

678
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:50,810
這是精靈們在很久以前編造出的故事
It's a story, created long ago by genies,

679
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:52,380
目的是為了讓人們相信
to make people believe

680
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,810
他們不必為了滿足自己的欲望
That you did not need to seek out a bottle

681
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:57,040
而四處尋找瓶子
in order to someday have what you desire.

682
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,200
而直到今天
And so to this day,

683
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,030
人們還在不停地拆開如愿骨
people keep pulling wishbones apart,

684
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:07,350
期望有魔力從中噴涌而出
hoping that magic will spill out of them.

685
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:10,920
但如愿骨真正想要的
But what a wishbone really wants

686
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:14,060
與我們所想要的無二
is no different from what we all want.

687
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,910
那就是與自己的另一半重逢
To be joined to our other half.

688
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:24,470
而一旦與愛人被分離  你會盡其所能
And if we're separated, you will do whatever it takes

689
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:25,710
與愛人重聚
to be together again.

690
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,180
正如這支如愿骨一樣
Just like a wishbone.

691
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:45,520
仙

692
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:45,520
境

693
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:45,520
奇

694
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:45,520
緣

695
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:45,520
第一季  第四集
