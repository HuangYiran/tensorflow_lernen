舞蹈学院 前情提要
Previously on Dance Academy...

2
00:00:02,206 --> 00:00:04,226
你要上台去演珀尔塞福涅
You need to go on stage as Persephone.

3
00:00:05,146 --> 00:00:07,190
如果你发挥出自己的水平
And if you dance it the way I know you can

4
00:00:07,206 --> 00:00:10,158
你的前途将会一片光明
your future is written in the stars.

5
00:00:13,174 --> 00:00:15,162
塔拉 你还好吗 你还好吗
Tara, you OK? You OK?

6
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:17,190
- 你会没事的 - 塔拉
- You're going to be fine. - Tara?

7
00:00:59,614 --> 00:01:03,494
舞蹈学院 第三季第13集

8
00:01:12,645 --> 00:01:13,697
我整夜未眠
I've been up all night.

9
00:01:14,613 --> 00:01:18,665
可惜合同需要今天签订 所以这是最后的机会
Unfortunately the contracts need to go out today so this is the last opportunity.

10
00:01:18,681 --> 00:01:20,613
我无法恨她
I can't hate her.

11
00:01:20,633 --> 00:01:22,673
如果我都不能振作起来
How am I supposed to compete with her

12
00:01:22,689 --> 00:01:24,673
我该怎么和她竞争
if I can't even muster up a shred...

13
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:26,653
为另一种原因而跳舞
Dance for a different reason.

14
00:01:37,673 --> 00:01:40,621
变化无处不在
So often change is incremental,

15
00:01:41,665 --> 00:01:44,645
你甚至不会注意到的细小转折
tiny turning points you don't even notice.

16
00:01:45,693 --> 00:01:47,693
还有其他的变故
Then there are other events -

17
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:50,681
突然的 巨大的 决定性的
sudden, monumental, defining -

18
00:01:50,697 --> 00:01:52,673
改变你的一生
that change you forever.

19
00:01:56,621 --> 00:01:59,641
在你投出骰子的一霎那
And in that split second after you've thrown the dice,

20
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:02,689
结局已经注定 然而你迫切想要改变
it could go one way but you desperately want it to go another,

21
00:02:08,657 --> 00:02:10,685
让前途不再悬而未决
where your future is suspended in limbo,

22
00:02:17,657 --> 00:02:18,685
你会乞求吗
do you beg?

23
00:02:18,701 --> 00:02:20,641
会讨价还价吗
Do you bargain?

24
00:02:20,657 --> 00:02:23,637
希望 祈祷还是威胁
Wish? Pray? Threaten?

25
00:02:23,653 --> 00:02:25,629
抗争到底还是放任自流
Do you fight or let go?

26
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:32,653
是否绝望时才能看清自己 知道自己的能量
Is it only in limbo that you finally know yourself and what you're capable of?

27
00:02:40,677 --> 00:02:44,625
塔拉摔倒时 她有缺陷的脊椎另一侧
When Tara fell, the other side of her defective vertebra

28
00:02:44,645 --> 00:02:47,637
- 折断并错位 - 需要多久才能康复
- snapped and slipped forward. - How long will it take, recovery?

29
00:02:47,657 --> 00:02:50,605
去年我受伤时休息了八周
Last year when I broke it I was out for eight weeks

30
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:53,469
如果我有幸拿到合约 就得尽快恢复
and if I'm lucky enough to get a contract I'll have to start work soon.

31
00:02:53,689 --> 00:02:55,701
咱们先让你站起来
Let's focus on getting you back on your feet.

32
00:02:56,617 --> 00:02:58,641
这是开放性手术
It's an open operation,

33
00:02:58,661 --> 00:03:00,673
意味着需要切开塔拉的腹部
which means they'll go through Tara's abdomen

34
00:03:00,693 --> 00:03:03,681
插入铁丝箍 替换椎间盘
and insert a wire cage which will replace the disc.

35
00:03:03,697 --> 00:03:06,605
格瑞斯
Grace.

36
00:03:06,621 --> 00:03:10,625
抱歉 听起来
Sorry. Um, that all sounds -

37
00:03:10,641 --> 00:03:12,677
是从一月开始吗
is it January I start?

38
00:03:12,697 --> 00:03:15,653
我打算去越南过圣诞节
I've got this Christmas in Vietnam fantasy plan.

39
00:03:16,693 --> 00:03:19,649
事实上 我说的是
Actually, what I was leading to...

40
00:03:19,669 --> 00:03:22,677
我们这次不打算和你签约
We've decided not to offer you a contract this time.

41
00:03:23,701 --> 00:03:26,621
很显然你才华横溢
Obviously you are a tremendous talent

42
00:03:26,641 --> 00:03:29,653
但我的原则是和谐的环境
but my philosophy is that a harmonious environment

43
00:03:29,673 --> 00:03:31,653
比个别舞蹈演员的资格
is more conducive to creating good work

44
00:03:31,673 --> 00:03:33,673
更利于创造好的作品
than the quality of the individual dancers.

45
00:03:33,693 --> 00:03:37,653
你是说我和别人不和
You're saying I don't play nicely with others,

46
00:03:37,673 --> 00:03:39,685
还是你不想和我合作
or that you don't want to work with me.

47
00:03:41,653 --> 00:03:43,669
还是两者兼有
Or both.

48
00:03:46,653 --> 00:03:48,613
她是前任冠军
She's the pre-champion.

49
00:03:48,633 --> 00:03:50,637
传言说我们都不会拿到合约
Rumours about none of us getting contracts -

50
00:03:50,653 --> 00:03:52,625
越来越可信了
gaining credibility.

51
00:04:00,621 --> 00:04:02,613
你确定没有任何问题了吗
You sure you don't have any questions?

52
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:04,625
好的
Alright, then.

53
00:04:04,641 --> 00:04:05,993
你先睡一会儿
We'll get you nicely to sleep.

54
00:04:06,009 --> 00:04:07,377
几个小时后再见
You'll see us in a few hours.

55
00:04:08,685 --> 00:04:11,661
想倒数十个数吗
Want to count us in from 10?

56
00:04:11,677 --> 00:04:15,625
十 九
10, 9,

57
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:19,681
八 七
8, 7,

58
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:24,697
六 五
6, 5,

59
00:04:27,617 --> 00:04:31,677
四 三
4, 3...

60
00:04:35,685 --> 00:04:37,621
你快迟到了吧
Aren't you late for class?

61
00:04:37,637 --> 00:04:38,641
不能穿这身去啊
You can't wear that.

62
00:04:38,657 --> 00:04:40,629
我不知道自己在做什么
I don't really know what I'm doing.

63
00:04:40,645 --> 00:04:41,649
你应该知道
Well, you should.

64
00:04:41,665 --> 00:04:42,685
这是你的潜意识
It's your subconscious.

65
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:44,657
来吧
Come on.

66
00:04:46,677 --> 00:04:49,673
你为什么对医生说你没有问题
Why did you tell the doctor you didn't have any questions?

67
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,625
我觉得是个大问题
I'd call it a fairly big one.

68
00:04:52,677 --> 00:04:56,625
如果手术不成功你再也不能跳舞了怎么办
What if the surgery doesn't work and you can never dance again?

69
00:04:56,645 --> 00:04:59,685
因为它必须成功 我不能经历这些然后一无所得
Because it has to work. I can't have come all this way for nothing.

70
00:04:59,701 --> 00:05:01,697
真的 你确定
Really? You sure about that?

71
00:05:16,665 --> 00:05:18,665
我们都是忠实粉丝
We're all big fans.

72
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:21,689
你技术扎实 有成为领舞的勇气
You have the technical facility and the courage of a leading man.

73
00:05:22,605 --> 00:05:24,697
领舞 天哪
Leading man. Wow.

74
00:05:25,613 --> 00:05:26,673
过奖了
If you say so.

75
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:32,649
可是我们舞团已经有几个
The difficulty is we already have several dancers of your type

76
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:33,681
你这样的舞者
in the company.

77
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:36,689
我希望奉行个人主义
I want to push things to be more individualistic.

78
00:05:37,605 --> 00:05:38,681
我的类型很多变
My type's totally fluid.

79
00:05:38,697 --> 00:05:40,677
你们想要什么样的我都能胜任
I can be whoever you want me to be.

80
00:05:40,693 --> 00:05:42,653
我真的很抱歉 本
I'm really very sorry, Ben.

81
00:06:02,633 --> 00:06:04,661
塔拉 你的阿拉贝斯克舞姿腿不够高
Tara, those arabesques are still too low.

82
00:06:04,681 --> 00:06:07,625
如果你背部不适 就别练了
If your back is straining, please sit this out.

83
00:06:07,641 --> 00:06:09,609
我没事 抱歉 瑞贝卡
I'm fine. Sorry, Rebecca.

84
00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:13,625
所以 我进了舞团 我拿到合约了
So, I'm in the company. I get a contract.

85
00:06:15,217 --> 00:06:17,681
我怎么知道 我又不能预测未来
How would I know? I don't have access to the future.

86
00:06:17,701 --> 00:06:21,625
但是的 在这个版本的现实中你在跳舞
But, yes, in this version of reality you're dancing.

87
00:06:23,645 --> 00:06:26,661
不全是独角兽和三叶草 对吧
It's not all unicorns and clovers, is it?

88
00:06:28,617 --> 00:06:30,633
看上去真疼
That looks youchy.

89
00:06:30,649 --> 00:06:32,633
为了什么
And for what?

90
00:06:32,653 --> 00:06:34,649
你甚至不想进舞团
You didn't even like being in the corps.

91
00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:38,661
常年的批评 永远做不到最好
Constant criticism. Never being good enough.

92
00:06:38,681 --> 00:06:42,617
我打赌如果你再不能跳舞你会有些释怀
I bet part of you will be relieved if you can't dance again.

93
00:06:42,633 --> 00:06:44,653
但这是我梦寐以求的
But this is all I've ever wanted.

94
00:06:44,673 --> 00:06:46,693
你同意 牺牲是值得的
You agree. The sacrifice is worth it.

95
00:06:47,609 --> 00:06:49,625
血压怎么样
How's our BP looking?

96
00:06:49,645 --> 00:06:52,661
- 她是不是 - 血压升高
- Is she becoming... - ..hypertensive?

97
00:06:52,677 --> 00:06:54,677
情况不太好
I don't like the swelling.

98
00:06:59,617 --> 00:07:01,673
你得帮我拿到和马库斯的面试
You've got to get me that audition with Marcus.

99
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:03,625
本 你在仓促做决定
Ben, you're scrambling.

100
00:07:03,645 --> 00:07:05,621
奥斯汀甚至都挤不进你的前五个选择
Austin didn't even make your top five.

101
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,681
你说的没错 这真是"学院血案"
And you're right. It's a bloodbath.

102
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:18,665
- 我坚持了四年 就是为了...  - ...一无所获
- Four years. All for... - ...absolutely nothing.

103
00:07:23,673 --> 00:07:26,657
里德 有戏吗
Reed, care to share with the group?

104
00:07:43,685 --> 00:07:46,689
教芭蕾是没法招到学生的 老大
You're not gonna get any kids with ballet boss.

105
00:07:47,605 --> 00:07:49,605
那又如何
So?

106
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:52,641
拜托 我自己的工作面试我都没这么激动
Come on. I wasn't even this worked up on my own interview day.

107
00:07:52,661 --> 00:07:55,689
- 他们把时间改成今天下午了 - 扶着另外一边
- They changed it to this afternoon. - Grab the other end.

108
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:01,605
正式确定了吗
Does this make it official?

109
00:08:01,621 --> 00:08:02,685
由你来管舞蹈中心
You running the centre.

110
00:08:02,701 --> 00:08:05,657
我跟我老婆说 都怪你
I told my wife to blame you.

111
00:08:05,677 --> 00:08:08,525
其他东西我都不懂 
How I'm going to fit it in with everything else

112
00:08:08,545 --> 00:08:09,797
- 我怎么管理这个地方 - 这件事值得你去做
- I do not know. - It's worth it.

113
00:08:10,617 --> 00:08:14,009
至少在未来会有意义 如果你从教小孩子们街舞开始
At least it's going to be. If you start the kids off with hip hop

114
00:08:14,082 --> 00:08:15,618
慢慢过渡到教芭蕾
and drip-feed them ballet later.

115
00:08:15,692 --> 00:08:18,224
我都分不清嘻哈和锁舞啊
I wouldn't recognise a pop from a lock.

116
00:08:18,841 --> 00:08:21,801
更别说你跳的那些什么椅子舞
Let alone those armchair things you do.

117
00:08:34,869 --> 00:08:36,825
你跳得不错啊
That was good.

118
00:08:36,845 --> 00:08:39,857
但是你双脚的位置要一直保持在臀部以下 准备好了吗
But keep your feet underneath your bum at all times. Ready?

119
00:08:47,785 --> 00:08:48,805
好吧 好吧
Yep. Yep.

120
00:08:50,729 --> 00:08:51,749
是啊 我知道
No, I know.

121
00:08:51,769 --> 00:08:54,729
但是要等到肿胀消退了 
They can't even give us a prognosis on her walking

122
00:08:54,745 --> 00:08:56,745
医生才能告诉我们 塔拉能否再站起来
until the swelling goes down.

123
00:08:56,765 --> 00:09:00,729
我们已经把你拍电影的事儿告诉老家的每一个人啦
We've been telling everyone at home young Kat's in a movie.

124
00:09:00,745 --> 00:09:03,777
呃 我只是运气很好
Uh, I got pretty lucky.

125
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,805
尼尔 抱歉 我走开一下
Sorry, Neil, excuse me for a second.

126
00:09:09,741 --> 00:09:10,765
她怎么样了
How is she?

127
00:09:10,781 --> 00:09:11,797
有什么新消息吗
Any news?

128
00:09:12,717 --> 00:09:14,813
最新消息是 她可能要坐轮椅了
The update is she might be in a wheelchair.

129
00:09:15,733 --> 00:09:18,729
那你来这又是想干嘛 来炫耀你得到了合约
And you're here to... what? Gloat about getting a contract?

130
00:09:18,745 --> 00:09:20,749
我没得到合约
I didn't get a contract.

131
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:24,793
昨晚塔拉说 她怀念我们还是朋友的时候
Last night Tara said she missed us being friends.

132
00:09:25,805 --> 00:09:29,725
我本以为我希望这样的事情发生 但实际上我不想
I thought I wanted something like this to happen but I didn't.

133
00:09:29,741 --> 00:09:31,741
我一点也不愿意她变成这样
At all.

134
00:09:47,725 --> 00:09:48,789
我能再来一遍吗
Can I go again?

135
00:09:51,781 --> 00:09:52,813
今天发生了不少事情
It's been a big day.

136
00:09:54,765 --> 00:09:55,813
多事之秋
Big year.

137
00:09:59,789 --> 00:10:01,729
我能跳得更好的
I can do it better.

138
00:10:01,749 --> 00:10:05,773
每所芭蕾院校都把舞团视为根基
Every ballet school puts their company up on a pedestal

139
00:10:05,793 --> 00:10:08,761
好像只有身在舞团 凡事才有意义
as though they're the only place worth anything.

140
00:10:08,777 --> 00:10:11,749
可是没让你们做好落选的准备
They don't prepare you for this.

141
00:10:14,757 --> 00:10:16,749
你感到失望 也是理所应当
You're allowed to feel disappointed.

142
00:10:32,729 --> 00:10:33,813
什么叫"情况复杂"
What sort of complications?

143
00:10:33,813 --> 00:10:37,729
她目前情况稳定 但是这个手术难度较大
She's stable. But it's a very delicate operation.

144
00:10:37,745 --> 00:10:39,725
手术还需要些时间
It's going to take some more time.

145
00:10:39,741 --> 00:10:40,793
那到底还需要多久呢
How much more time?

146
00:10:40,813 --> 00:10:44,761
很抱歉 我得走了 我得去参加一个演出 真的很抱歉
I'm sorry. I've got to go. I've got a performance. I'm so sorry.

147
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:45,793
没事儿
OK.

148
00:10:45,813 --> 00:10:49,793
- 手术会有什么其他风险吗 - 不会
- Will there be any additional risk? - No additional risk.

149
00:10:49,809 --> 00:10:51,717
她的确有些...
She does have...

150
00:10:55,757 --> 00:11:00,745
凯特 情况稳定意味着她会好起来的
Kat. Stable means she's going to be OK.

151
00:11:01,741 --> 00:11:05,781
这跟山姆的情况不一样 相信我 好吗
This isn't a Sammy situation. OK?

152
00:11:05,797 --> 00:11:07,741
别想太多
Come on.

153
00:11:07,757 --> 00:11:08,801
我去替你
I'll take you over.

154
00:11:10,781 --> 00:11:13,721
可能是我们自己看问题的方式不对
Maybe we're just looking at this the wrong way.

155
00:11:13,741 --> 00:11:16,785
这家舞团现在当家的是个初出茅庐的总监
I mean, the company is an organisation in turmoil,

156
00:11:16,805 --> 00:11:19,801
舞团陷于混乱中 随时可能垮台
poised to explode with an inexperienced director at the helm.

157
00:11:20,717 --> 00:11:22,725
除此之外 我是群舞演员
And besides, corps de ballet -

158
00:11:22,745 --> 00:11:24,761
还是说我们有独舞机会呢
is it just me or are we soloist standard?

159
00:11:24,777 --> 00:11:25,809
要我说也该是首席舞者
I'd say principals.

160
00:11:30,809 --> 00:11:33,733
我们来做个约定 就现在
We should make a pact. Now.

161
00:11:35,525 --> 00:11:36,749
如果咱俩中只有一个被选进舞团
If either of us gets in...

162
00:11:36,765 --> 00:11:37,805
我们也要拒绝
we still say no.

163
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:43,781
我无心打扰
Not to interrupt.

164
00:11:43,797 --> 00:11:45,749
不过你可以进来面试了 奥利弗
We're ready for you, Oliver.

165
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:08,801
你给我乖乖在后排当半年伴舞
Just back row of the corps for two seasons

166
00:12:09,721 --> 00:12:11,733
如果我发现你有一点点耍个性...
and if I get one whiff of ego out of you...

167
00:12:11,753 --> 00:12:13,785
只要你要求 我就乖乖做个有脉搏的道具
I'll be a prop with a pulse if you ask me to.

168
00:12:26,737 --> 00:12:28,725
第二个场景
Exhibit B

169
00:12:28,741 --> 00:12:29,757
让你考虑清楚
for your consideration.

170
00:12:32,761 --> 00:12:34,773
你总是压抑自己不去享受生活
You've always pretzelled yourself

171
00:12:34,793 --> 00:12:36,789
而是全身心投入芭蕾
over the ballet versus life equation.

172
00:12:36,809 --> 00:12:39,805
而这就是 你的生活中没有舞蹈的样子
This is what happens if you remove dancing altogether.

173
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,793
什么嘛 我们全都没有工作 就在山上晃悠
What? We're all unemployed and hanging out on the hill?

174
00:12:42,809 --> 00:12:44,781
不是啦 是零压力
No pressure.

175
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:46,785
没竞争
No competition.

176
00:12:46,805 --> 00:12:49,813
还有和你想象中一样多的爱恋情节
As many crushes as your little heart fancies.

177
00:12:50,733 --> 00:12:53,773
最重要的是 我们明年还可以呆在一起
Plus, we could stay together next year.

178
00:12:53,793 --> 00:12:59,753
我也不确定 就算这样 我觉得我还是需要坚持梦想 证明自己
I don't know. Even then I think I still need a dream to define me.

179
00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:02,725
我就猜到你会这么说
Kind of knew you'd say that.

180
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:15,273
距离国立舞蹈学院 剧目葛蓓莉亚开演还有十分钟
The National Academy's performance of Coppelia will commence in 10 minutes.

181
00:13:15,293 --> 00:13:17,321
你一般很难接受被拒这种事啊
You don't normally cope this well with rejection.

182
00:13:17,321 --> 00:13:19,281
我一直等着这次打击呢
I'm waiting for it to hit me.

183
00:13:19,301 --> 00:13:23,309
或者说 我已经被打击了 只是我不在乎
Or maybe it already has and I just don't care.

184
00:13:24,229 --> 00:13:28,217
因为你可以去任何地方 留在任何一个舞团啊
'Cause you can go anywhere and dance with any company.

185
00:13:28,237 --> 00:13:32,245
不是跳舞 而是找到自己真正想做的事
Not dance, find something I actually care about.

186
00:13:33,293 --> 00:13:37,217
嗨 我最好的朋友正在做脊椎手术
Hey, my best friend's having spinal surgery

187
00:13:37,237 --> 00:13:39,285
而我则一直希望能有一个人对我说
and I keep hoping someone's going to say,

188
00:13:39,305 --> 00:13:41,281
凯特 你今晚不用登台
'Kat, you don't have to dance tonight.'

189
00:13:43,237 --> 00:13:47,237
不过这是到目前为止 我舞蹈生涯的巅峰了
To date, this is the high point of my dancing life

190
00:13:47,257 --> 00:13:50,281
不过只要能不去跳 什么奇葩理由我都可以找
and I'll take any horrific excuse not to do it.

191
00:13:52,253 --> 00:13:53,293
没准你跟我很像
You could also be like me.

192
00:13:55,305 --> 00:13:58,249
最开始你也不是一门心思想投身舞蹈
You never really wanted this in the first place,

193
00:13:58,265 --> 00:14:00,281
你只是觉得你应该这么做
you just decided you should want it.

194
00:14:05,285 --> 00:14:07,217
克里斯提 你得走了
Christian, you got to go.

195
00:14:07,233 --> 00:14:09,221
没事儿 不急
It's cool.

196
00:14:09,241 --> 00:14:12,293
听我的 这次会面你不该迟到
Trust me. This is not an appointment you can be late for.

197
00:14:23,301 --> 00:14:25,249
你开玩笑的吧 对不对
You're kidding, right?

198
00:14:27,245 --> 00:14:29,253
你在跟我开玩笑 哈
You're kidding. Ha.

199
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:31,233
我早说过你会得到合约的 是不是
I told you, didn't I?

200
00:14:31,249 --> 00:14:33,249
我希望你能替我保管
I want you to keep it.

201
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:36,217
我不能那么做 这是你的合约啊 你得把它签了
I can't. It's a contract. You've got to sign it.

202
00:14:39,229 --> 00:14:40,253
噢 不 不 不 不
Oh, no, no, no, no.

203
00:14:40,273 --> 00:14:42,269
你不能逃避 至少这一次不行
You are not walking away. Not this time.

204
00:14:42,289 --> 00:14:45,305
我想留在这里工作 我想教课
I want to work here. I want to teach.

205
00:14:46,225 --> 00:14:48,253
那你就在舞团待个十年 然后出来当老师啊
So do ten years in the company then be a teacher.

206
00:14:48,269 --> 00:14:50,233
我终于找到了自己想做的事情
I finally know what I want to do.

207
00:14:50,249 --> 00:14:52,297
而我要从现在开始做了
And I want to start doing it.

208
00:15:06,241 --> 00:15:09,217
所以... 一人分饰双角来救场
So... dance double to the rescue.

209
00:15:10,265 --> 00:15:12,225
可以这么说
Something like that.

210
00:15:12,241 --> 00:15:15,297
快跟我说说 他喜欢你 是不是
So, come on. He loved you, right?

211
00:15:15,313 --> 00:15:17,237
说实话我不清楚
I honestly couldn't tell.

212
00:15:17,257 --> 00:15:20,249
不过我喜欢马库斯 奥斯汀也不错
But I like Marcus. Austin could be good.

213
00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:24,225
刚才一路跑过来我都在想...
And running over here I just kept thinking...

214
00:15:30,301 --> 00:15:33,233
这一整年你都在当我最好的朋友
You've been my best friend this whole year

215
00:15:33,253 --> 00:15:35,313
而我也想和你一起度过下一年
I don't want to spend the next one without you.

216
00:15:36,229 --> 00:15:38,245
我不能去
I can't go.

217
00:15:38,261 --> 00:15:39,293
不能去奥斯汀
To Austin.

218
00:15:41,237 --> 00:15:44,285
我有太多要做的事情
I've got so much stuff to work out.

219
00:15:44,301 --> 00:15:46,257
我能帮你啊
I can help.

220
00:15:46,273 --> 00:15:48,253
我很擅长处理事情 所以...
I'm good with stuff so...

221
00:15:48,273 --> 00:15:52,289
我的软肋就是把某人当成全世界 然后因此憎恨他们
My MO is making someone my whole world and then hating them for it.

222
00:15:52,305 --> 00:15:56,233
而我不想恨你
I don't want to hate you.

223
00:16:00,289 --> 00:16:03,241
我知道目前的状况 但我...
I understand in the circumstances but I am...

224
00:16:03,257 --> 00:16:05,269
凯特帮了我一个大忙
Kat did me an amazing favour.

225
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:09,289
她让我明白 如果我要和芭蕾分手
I figured if I was saying goodbye to ballet

226
00:16:09,305 --> 00:16:11,289
我希望完美地谢幕
I wanted to make it a good one.

227
00:16:15,245 --> 00:16:16,277
格瑞斯
Grace.

228
00:16:31,305 --> 00:16:34,245
艾比盖尔 没关系的 我理解
Abigail, it's OK. Really.

229
00:16:36,249 --> 00:16:39,277
很抱歉我现在得走了 我晚上有约了
I'm sorry but I do have a dinner that I have to get to.

230
00:16:42,245 --> 00:16:46,261
四年勤练舞 终得一纸约
I just worked so hard.

231
00:17:09,309 --> 00:17:11,305
你干嘛带我来这儿
Why would you take me here?

232
00:17:12,221 --> 00:17:13,285
这是因为...
Because, trust me.

233
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:17,261
当有噩耗发生
When the bad stuff happens

234
00:17:17,277 --> 00:17:19,249
你不能被它们牵着鼻子走
you can't let it drag you down.

235
00:17:21,289 --> 00:17:23,281
你不能随着它改变你
You can't let it change you.

236
00:17:23,297 --> 00:17:25,297
这不是你真正的目的
That's not the real reason.

237
00:17:26,217 --> 00:17:29,233
你的路数太逊了 我不会让你得逞的
This is a cheap stunt, I'm not going to let you manipulate me.

238
00:17:29,253 --> 00:17:32,237
那好 你来告诉我 我们为什么来这儿
Alright. Tell me. Why do you think we're here?

239
00:17:32,253 --> 00:17:34,257
因为...
Because...

240
00:17:36,269 --> 00:17:38,237
因为我看不见他
because I can't see him.

241
00:17:39,285 --> 00:17:42,241
就算过了这么久 我还是那么想见他
Even now, and I so want to see him.

242
00:17:44,261 --> 00:17:46,253
我知道他永远离开我们了
I know he's gone.

243
00:17:46,269 --> 00:17:48,277
山姆不在了
Sammy died.

244
00:17:51,277 --> 00:17:53,257
他的梦想都还没实现
He didn't get his dream.

245
00:17:53,277 --> 00:17:56,285
甚至没有机会重新找到一个梦想
He didn't even get the possibility of finding a new one.

246
00:17:58,305 --> 00:18:00,249
但我活在当下
And I'm alive.

247
00:18:11,285 --> 00:18:13,257
嗨
Hi.

248
00:18:13,273 --> 00:18:15,225
你不是该去跳葛蓓莉亚了吗
Coppelia?

249
00:18:15,245 --> 00:18:19,313
小塔 别担心那个 我想要待在你的身边
T, don't worry about that. I'm where I want to be.

250
00:18:20,229 --> 00:18:21,241
但你是领舞啊
You're the lead.

251
00:18:21,257 --> 00:18:23,297
现在对我来说 领舞也不是那么重要了
It didn't matter so much in the end.

252
00:18:24,217 --> 00:18:26,505
待会再跟你解释 我得去找你爸妈了
I'll explain later. I've got to go get your Mum and Dad.

253
00:18:27,221 --> 00:18:31,261
我的脚趾 它们还能...
My toes, are they...

254
00:18:49,273 --> 00:18:52,313
即使我已经决定接受这一切
So even though I'd decided I wouldn't feel sorry for myself

255
00:18:53,229 --> 00:18:55,313
复健却不像是在公园里散步那么简单
rehab wasn't a walk in the park.

256
00:18:56,233 --> 00:19:00,261
实际上 我再也不会把在公园散步当做理所当然了
In fact, I'd never take walking in a park for granted again.

257
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:03,237
更不用说跳舞
Much less dancing.

258
00:19:03,257 --> 00:19:07,277
我要努力拼搏 找回自我
I'm going to fight as hard as I can to get back to where I was.

259
00:19:07,293 --> 00:19:10,253
不过如果事与愿违
But if that doesn't happen

260
00:19:10,269 --> 00:19:12,221
我再也不能成为职业舞者
and I never dance professionally

261
00:19:12,237 --> 00:19:14,221
我也可以坦然接受
I know I'll still be OK.

262
00:19:14,237 --> 00:19:17,217
艾比 这就是你最好的水平了吗
Abby, call that 100%?

263
00:19:17,233 --> 00:19:19,217
无懈可击的你呢
Where's your turnout?

264
00:19:34,301 --> 00:19:38,237
我是凯特・卡拉马科夫 我来试镜二号女招待的角色
Kat Karamakov testing for the role of waitress number two.

265
00:19:40,281 --> 00:19:43,237
我很抱歉 请无视我
I'm sorry. Pretend that didn't happen.

266
00:19:44,257 --> 00:19:48,225
当初我来到舞蹈学院 努力成为最好的芭蕾舞者
I came to the academy to be the best ballerina I could be

267
00:19:48,241 --> 00:19:50,273
但我丢失了勇气
but what I took away was courage,

268
00:19:50,293 --> 00:19:52,313
失去了驻足停留的勇气 对着空白页
to stop and wonder at the blank page,

269
00:19:53,229 --> 00:19:54,313
或宽阔的道路思索的勇气
the open road,

270
00:19:55,229 --> 00:19:57,305
拥有雄心和壮志的勇气
to dream big but also wide,

271
00:19:59,273 --> 00:20:02,265
随时准备拥有新的梦想
allowing room for new dreams,

272
00:20:02,281 --> 00:20:04,233
不期而遇的梦想
unexpected ones.

273
00:20:05,241 --> 00:20:08,221
因为最重要的不在于实现梦想
Because the point never was achieving the dream,

274
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:11,289
而是要心怀梦想 并为之倾尽全力
it was having one and pouring everything into it.

275
00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:14,253
稍等一会 他还在上课
Hang on a sec. I think he's still teaching a class.

276
00:20:17,237 --> 00:20:20,245
杰登 如果你连衣服都不拉好
Jayden, how am I supposed to correct you

277
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:22,225
我要怎么纠正你的动作呢
if you don't pull up your tights?

278
00:20:23,297 --> 00:20:26,285
永远不知道将来会发生什么 这一点很有趣
It's funny, I have no idea what happens next.

279
00:20:26,305 --> 00:20:30,313
不过能用自己的方式活出精彩
But I'm excited about finding my own way

280
00:20:31,229 --> 00:20:33,257
我也乐在其中
to make it count,

281
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:35,261
山姆就是这样
the way Sammy did.

282
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:39,289
在这里 每个人都能拥有梦想 尽情起舞
He would have loved this space

283
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:43,233
他也一定会爱上这里的
where anyone can dream and dance.

284
00:20:46,253 --> 00:20:48,277
现在我宣布 舞蹈中心正式成立啦
I now declare it officially open.

285
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:02,309
这还未成书 我也确信它绝对不会出版
It's not a book yet and I'm pretty sure it won't get published

286
00:21:03,225 --> 00:21:04,609
但里面全是关于我们和舞蹈学院
but it's about us and the academy.

287
00:21:06,285 --> 00:21:10,253
好了 小伙伴们 这里就是用来跳舞的
OK, guys. This place is about dancing.

288
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,313
那我们就来一段吧
So, how about we do some?

289
00:21:58,857 --> 00:22:00,309
有一阵子了 跟我说说吧
Been a while. Tell me about it.

290
00:22:26,241 --> 00:22:29,269
我简直不敢相信... 你是怎么编排出这段舞的
I can't believe - how did you all organise this?

291
00:22:29,285 --> 00:22:31,261
这是献给你的舞蹈
This is a thank you dance.

292
00:22:31,277 --> 00:22:33,245
虽然迟了点 总比没有强
Better late than never.

293
00:22:39,277 --> 00:22:42,217
一起来吧 这还是你的点子呢
Come on. This was your idea.

294
00:22:42,237 --> 00:22:44,257
我一个月之前才上过第一节课呢
I only did my first class a month ago.

295
00:22:44,273 --> 00:22:46,233
我们慢慢来
We'll take it slow.

296
00:22:47,301 --> 00:22:49,297
我们与你同在
We'll figure it out together.

297
00:23:16,281 --> 00:23:17,289
在我小时候
When I was young,

298
00:23:17,309 --> 00:23:21,237
我不太明白重力这回事
I wasn't so clear on the whole gravity thing.

299
00:23:21,257 --> 00:23:23,269
而我那天马行空的想象力让我吃了不少苦头
And my imagination got me in a lot of trouble.

300
00:23:52,313 --> 00:23:54,313
但我记得有这么一刻
But I remember there was this one moment

301
00:23:55,229 --> 00:23:57,257
时间仿佛静止
where time stopped

302
00:23:57,273 --> 00:24:00,241
万物犹如有灵
and everything made sense.

303
00:24:06,233 --> 00:24:09,281
从那时起 我就深知在另一个平行时空
From then on, I've always known that in another life

304
00:24:09,297 --> 00:24:11,269
我可以飞翔
I could fly.

305
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,786
所以此生
And that's why in this life

306
00:24:15,475 --> 00:24:16,487
我献给舞蹈
I dance.
