00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,881
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Don't.

381
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,005
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh! Ha-ha! Oh, yeah! We're at a comedy party!

382
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,726
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Move the fuck out of my way. Get a room.

383
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,003
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Tim, you still owe me $40.

384
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,244
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah, tomorrow it's $60! Fucking dickweed.

385
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,164
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Why is the cage empty?

386
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,767
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What did I tell you about moving my prisoners?

387
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,331
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}He's in interrogation.

388
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,804
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Why would he be in interrogation when I'm standing right here?

389
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,247
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}They came and got him.

390
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,367
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Who's "they"?

391
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,562
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It better be two of me. Is it two of me?

392
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,767
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It was a lady.

393
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,285
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm a lady. Did I come and get him?

394
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,482
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No, it was a different lady. She was nice.

395
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,882
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm fucking nice. Why was she nice to you?

396
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,485
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}She made me give her the keys.

397
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,722
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm gonna make you fucking bend over...

398
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,962
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and I'm gonna reach up your ass into your pocket

399
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,485
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and get the keys to your house.

400
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,449
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Then I'm gonna drive there...

401
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,762
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}come in your front door and kill you in your sleep.

402
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,407
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I think I have a clear idea of what we're looking for,

403
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and I appreciate your time.

404
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,649
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Wow, lady, you're on a real fucking roll.

405
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,887
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Excuse me?

406
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,246
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No, I won't excuse you.

407
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,971
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I just spent the last 30 minutes thinking of ways to kill you.

408
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,083
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, when did we meet?

409
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,321
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Is this your lawyer?

410
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,086
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Are you an insurance salesman? Do you sell those shitty suits?

411
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,766
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm Special Agent Sarah Ashburn. How can I help you?

412
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You can get all of that and get the fuck out of here.

413
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,081
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}This is my room

414
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,322
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Were you about to be questioned by a detective?

415
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,285
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I am a detective and that's my perp.

416
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,728
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Ah! I understand now.

417
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,044
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Detective, Mr. Rojas will be continuing on with me.

418
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,483
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No. It's a jurisdictional issue.

419
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,766
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Not gonna happen.

420
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Your efforts are duly noted.

421
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,171
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And if you're okay with everything, could you just...

422
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,402
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- close the door on the way out? - I'll shut the door on you.

423
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Will you lay down and put your head in the door?

424
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,329
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'll slam it about 157,000 times.

425
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,925
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Aw, shit, girl, you better run.

426
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,923
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Shut your mouth. - Run like you on fire.

427
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,161
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Be quiet.

428
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,322
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Get up and we'll settle this outside.

429
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,164
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I won't be going outside.

430
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,687
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You're gonna get up and come outside.

431
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,921
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No, ma'am.

432
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,764
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Fine. We'll do this inside.

433
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,129
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Can somebody remove this person from the interrogation room?

434
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,563
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Mental illness is nothing to be ashamed of. It runs in many families.

435
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,767
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm gonna hit you.

436
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,046
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You're not. Please don't.

437
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,402
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm gonna hit you and knock all your little buttons.

438
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,607
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm gonna hit you there, or here...

439
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,806
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Do not put your finger in...

440
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,166
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Stop touching my buttons!

441
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,321
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Stop wearing buttons.

442
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,642
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Don't move those fucking hands at me.

443
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'll get that stupid barrette!

444
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,443
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'll take that barrette right out of your fucking hair!

445
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,489
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Stop, stop, stop!

446
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,366
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Both of you... my office now.

447
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,764
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Nope. Not in there.

448
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,322
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}There is nothing I can do, Mullins. The FBI has jurisdiction.

449
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Maybe they're in here.

450
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,846
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Stop. Will you stop?

451
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,046
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Nope, they're not in there.

452
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,851
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What is she doing?

453
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,443
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}She's looking for my balls.

454
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,042
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hey, if anyone sees the Captain's balls...

455
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,923
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}let me know. They're about this big, but a lot tinier.

456
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,443
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}They're like a pea... or like a ball bearing.

457
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:54,287
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Or if you've ever seen a mouse ball, about half that size.

458
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,126
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Incredibly tiny. They're like really, really tiny...

459
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,886
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}little girl balls. If little girls had balls.

460
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,806
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}So if you find little, tiny girl balls...

461
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,924
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}that are so fucking tiny and shriveled up...

462
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,244
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}let me know, because I'll put them right back up his scrotum!

463
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,686
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Knock it off.

464
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,604
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}How about you do something for once?

465
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What do you want me to do?

466
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,321
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Have my back

467
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,846
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and stop being so goddamn disappointing like everybody else!

468
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,331
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, that was professional.

469
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Was that not professional? Here.

470
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,891
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Let me be professional. Let me help you pick up your bag.

471
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,121
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's very mature.

472
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,761
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Let me just straighten that shit up.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}He's a goddamn animal, and I'm trying to keep him from meeting you.

568
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,084
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You gonna storm through Boston and take down a drug lord?

569
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,771
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah, I might.

570
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Have you met me?

571
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,281
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah, unfortunately.

572
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah, shut up.

573
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,484
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Look, I get out tomorrow.

574
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,166
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm coming home. I'm gonna be fine.

575
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,004
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I promise, all right?

576
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,091
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh! Never approach me if I'm not expecting you!

577
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What are you, an animal?

578
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,646
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You said you would stay off my case,

579
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,361
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and now I find you in front of Tatiana's apartment.

580
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,727
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I live here.

581
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,521
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, that's hilarious. You know what's not funny?

582
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,087
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That you stole a confidential FBI case file.

583
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,044
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I don't remember any of that.

584
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,443
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm going to say it one more time. Stand down, Officer.

585
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,006
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Fuck off, Officer.

586
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,845
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, okay, now you've really done it. I'm going to call my boss.

587
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,441
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah, you do that, tattle tits!

588
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,441
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Fucking narc!

589
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,802
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

590
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,248
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's Ashburn, sir. I need authorization...

591
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,683
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}to suspend a police officer from my investigation.

592
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,884
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Ashburn, why is working with local authorities a problem for you?

593
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,041
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Sir, it's not.

594
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,971
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I understand how this might sound coming from me...

595
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,006
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}but I think this individual might actually be mentally unstable.

596
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,527
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Her captain says she grew up on those streets

597
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,601
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and knows them better than anyone.

598
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,563
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That seems like an asset to our investigation.

599
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,967
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Sir, I...

600
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,326
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No, just work with her.

601
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,006
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Show me you can do this or forget the promotion.

602
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:28,245
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, sir, no need to take someone's badge. I think I can, uh...

603
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,842
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I think I can work something out, sir.

604
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,844
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}All right. Thank you.

605
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You know, uh...

606
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I just...

607
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,287
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I think you and I got off on the wrong foot.

608
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,521
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh!

609
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,602
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I don't know Boston, and you obviously have...

610
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,843
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}a lot of resources and a lot of knowledge about the area that could be,

611
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,445
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}you know, useful.

612
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,364
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Probably very. - So, uh...

613
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,364
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}maybe we can work together on this.

614
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,046
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I don't need your help to take down Larkin.

615
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,726
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You wouldn't even have known about Larkin if not for me.

616
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,161
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}So obviously the FBI can get information you can't.

617
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,529
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And there's a lot more where that comes from. A lot!

618
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,684
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Maybe I just need to hear a little "I need your help, Mullins."

619
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,171
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I won't be doing that.

620
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,163
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Okay, then get your ass back in your car.

621
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,685
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}This is ridiculous.

622
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,002
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm an FBI agent. You're a police officer.

623
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,844
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}"I need your help, Mullins."

624
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,845
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I need your help, Mullins.

625
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:23,483
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What is this, a whisper party? I want that third floor to hear it.

626
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:28,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}"I need your help, Mullins." Then give me a little echo on "Mullins".

627
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:36,049
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I need your help, Mullins, Mullins, Mullins...

628
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,884
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Just move. Move, move!

629
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}God! Even in that, you're annoying.

630
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,649
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I will work with you...

631
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,161
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}as long as we're clear that this is my case.

632
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,442
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's actually not... correct.

633
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,682
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Awesome. Glad you see it my way.

634
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,251
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Careful of the car.

635
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,801
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Goddamn it.

636
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,403
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Stand down. - I got it.

637
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,483
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- If you just let go... - I got it.

638
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,846
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I have it, just let me...

639
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,126
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I've got it.

640
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,931
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I got it.

641
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,604
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, shit!

642
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,767
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Ma'am, you, uh...

643
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,609
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Just go. Just go.

644
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,767
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Let me take the lead on this. I'm a trained interviewer.

645
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,241
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}"Interviewer?" What are you, Barbara Walters?

646
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,085
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I thought we'd go in there and bring in some heat on her.

647
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,242
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, what does that even mean?

648
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,925
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Me and you, we're the heat.

649
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,686
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We go in there, interrogate her, scare the shit out of her...

650
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,922
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We don't say "interrogation". It's too aggressive.

651
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,321
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Rule number one, catch more with sugar than with a stick.

652
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's a horrible fucking saying.

653
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,289
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We like to create a genuine personal interest in the subject,

654
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,484
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Then I'll perform instant personality assessments

655
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,971
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}based on the Myers-Briggs theory...

656
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,362
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Thematic Apperception Tests and...

657
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,726
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}a few others I won't bore you with.

658
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,371
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, I am balls deep in boredom.

659
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,165
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}All right, as long as you don't do that

660
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,651
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}whole long explanation again...

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'd camp out all week for tickets to that show.

709
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What is this, "Training Day?"

710
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,926
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}All fucking week I'd camp out for that!

720
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,926
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You should really stop smoking because it's an awfully bad habit.

721
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You're leaving half your lipstick in the ashtray.

722
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:38,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I had a great aunt that lost most of her teeth to smoking.

723
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,641
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Good to know.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}A lot of fistfights, too, but mostly smoking.

725
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,641
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We're gonna get out of your hair.

726
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,887
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That is not front door.

727
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,364
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Put your hands where I can see 'em!

731
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,123
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Do you have balloons of horse up your ass?

732
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,441
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You break my fucking door!

733

735
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,805
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Get out! Go down now. - Humans do.

736
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,645
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Don't touch underpants!

737
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,127
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Get out, bull in china shop! Out of my house!

738
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,526
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What the fuck's wrong with you?

739
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,124
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Wow, you are just all stick and no sugar.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Did you get the cigarette or not?

741
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:17,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Uh, yeah... of course I did.

742
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,481
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah.

743

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I snagged these matches, too. I think our guy likes to go to Club Ekko.

744
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,331
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Really? - Yes, really.

745
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,604

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hang on. The couch was disgusting. I need to wash my hands.

747
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,843

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}The curtains? You mean the curtains?

754
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,083
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Whatever. Okay?

755
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,205
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's just my family.

756
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,401
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh.

757
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,482
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah, it's sweet.

758
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,847
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You want something to eat?

759
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,361
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I didn't finish my submarine sandwich the other day.

760
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,051
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No, thank you.

761
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:12,011
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Sorry I don't have poached eggs in rubies for you.

762
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,483
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No, I don't mean to be rude, but...

763
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,844
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}one could catch a MRSA infection in here, that's all.

764
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What part of that wasn't rude?

765
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,491
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Just for your own well-being. For example, that door.

766
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That door has no way of locking.

767
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,164
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Someone could barge in at any moment. It's not safe.

768
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,322
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No one's coming in here...

769
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,171
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}because they know I keep this fully stocked.

770
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,171
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, my God.

771
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,481
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah, I know.

772
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,403
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}A Marlin 1894CB?

773
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,409
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Is that an FN PS90?

774
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,846
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah! Nice one.

775
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You have all of this in your house?

776
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,005
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You didn't even mention my baby.

777
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,531
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Look at this. Oh!

778
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}My little pride and joy.

779
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,291
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}This little beauty could vaporize an above-ground pool.

780
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,249
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}If you didn't want the pool anymore.

781
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,731
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- No kidding. - Pretty, huh?

782
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah. How do you refuse that sales pitch, huh?

783
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,042
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You don't. Unless you're an asshole.

784
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,888
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I haven't seen one of these since World War II.

785
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,566
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No! God, that... occasionally ticks.

786
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,723
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Put it back slowly. Slowly!

787
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,929
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Like half that speed.

788
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,204
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Half that speed!

789
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,042
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Stop shaking. Put your pinky down.

790
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,326
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I got it on eBay. It was supposed to be bigger and different.

791
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,401
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It doesn't matter.

792
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,801
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm gonna "Bad Feedback" his ass, though.

793
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,921
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}All right, ladies.

794
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,844
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Here's the DNA results from the book of matches

795
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,922
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and the cigarette butt you got from Tatiana's.

796
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,448
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We pulled two sets of prints. First one's a real nut job.

797
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,923
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Look at this. Reckless driving, assault, arson.

798
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,606
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Oh, God. Ahem! - Really?

799
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,922
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Who the fuck is this guy? - He's my assistant.

800
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,122
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- You know I'm an agent, right? - Arson?

801
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It was a drug house!

802
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,844
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I really feel the need to finish reading your files.

803
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,684
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I feel the need for you to stay out of my business

804
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,364
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}so I don't punch you in the teeth.

805
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,529
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What did you find out about the cigarette?

806
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,205
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Okay. Hank LeSoire.

807

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Got tons of ties to the drug world, black market...

809
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,484
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}as well as prostitution rings. Co-owner of Club Ekko.

810
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,849
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It looks like we found our distributor. Can you back that up, please?

811
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Back up to which one? - That.

812
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,047
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm not into you!

813
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Your breast is invading my space.

814
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,449
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Keep your finger out of my areola.

815
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,324
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Contain your areola!

816
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}There. Now we're even.

817
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,805
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}He looks like a real Chatty Cathy. Did you tap the phone?

818
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,721
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I haven't been able to. Guy gets a new prepaid every other week.

819
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,205
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}By the time I can get his phone number

820
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,685
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and hack in, he's got a new one.

821
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,047
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Let's get a bug into the phone he does have.

822
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,326
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I want to know what he's saying this week.

823
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,681
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Just get a court order and a bug. We'll do it ourselves.

824
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}If you're gonna boss me around, at least buy me dinner first.

825
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,243
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- No. - Okay. Cool.

826
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,209
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'll get that to you ASAP.

827
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,806
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You got to work on your game. That was weak.

828
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,361
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What? I thought I was being charming.

829
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,486
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I don't know what to say to that. Now I just feel bad for you.

830
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,527
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Okay, so LeSoire co-owns Club Ekko.

831
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:12,003
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Let's start surveilling it and figure out how to get a bug in his phone.

832
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,366
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Tell me everything you know about it.

833
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's just a shitty club downtown.

834
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I've never been inside,

835
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,006
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}but there's always a line of awful people around the corner.

836
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,527
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}They've called P.D. a couple times to break up fights.

837
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Oh, shit. - What's wrong?

838
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,523
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Just don't look. Don't look! Act like we're talking.

839
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,607
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hey, Shannon.

840
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,681
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hey, Robin.

841
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,685
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I really enjoyed our night together. You just disappeared on me.

842
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah, I know. I was there.

843
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,688
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Can I take you to dinner, or a movie, or something?

844
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:39,083
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Do you not hear how pathetic everything out of your mouth sounds?

845
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}There's a girl out there for you, but it's not me.

846
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:45,329
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Maybe it's her. Her lady business is like an old dirty attic.

847
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,324

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Okay, I look like I've been attacked.

943
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,925
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's not my fault.

944
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,162
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Oh, it's my fault? - Let me even out the bottom.

945
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,846
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Would you stop carving up my clothes?

946
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,407
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm making shorts! Everybody likes shorts.

947
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,722
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Jesus! Hold still!

948

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That feels... awkward. Weird. Don't touch that area.

949
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:24,204
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Don't duck down, or you're gonna suck my hand up there.

950
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,681
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Will you stop pulling my pants off?

951
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,684
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Jesus! - What?

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}They're my Spanx. They hold everything together.

955
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,887
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Why? What's gonna come popping out?

956
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,725
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Nothing! It just keeps everything where it's supposed to be.

957
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Shit, like medically?

958
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,881
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No, not medically. Just to...

959
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,725
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It just keeps it right where it's supposed to be.

960
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,964
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You got to vent that furnace.

961
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's a lot of compression and heat.

962
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,082
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It gets plenty of ventilation, thank you.

963
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,003
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}My hand's a foot off and it's on fire.

964
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,571
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Then why don't you cut them shorter

965
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,244
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}because no one can see my cervix yet?

966
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,846
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- I'll cut them shorter. - No, stop it! We're finished.

967
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,321
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Okay, let's do you now.

968
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,801
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I don't need that!

969
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,287
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What do you mean?

970
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,328
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I put my sexuality out through motion.

971
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:15,204
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}When this starts going, it's all... You'll get it.

972
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,926
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}So I have to look like this and you get to look like that?

973
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,924
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I know, it's not fair.

974
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:21,601
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We gotta tackle the helmet.

975
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,604
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's got a real style memory, huh?

976
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,764
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You gotta flip that shit over.

977
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,171
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Bend over. - Why?

978

983
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,884
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Not what you want it to mean.

984
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,281

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What are you looking at?

986
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,285
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I like how your friend's shorts make me feel in my shorts.

987

1036
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:52,448
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}They're like, "There's LeSoire!" Short skirts, too much makeup.

1037

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Don't feed them after midnight, right? They turn into more sluts.

1040
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,885
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Give me a whiskey.

1041
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I just noticed that lion.

1042

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Who the fuck keeps putting lions in the back?

1044
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:09,921
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Fourteen dollars.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Fourteen dollars?

1046
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:14,082
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Is it magic fucking whiskey?

1047
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,403
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Do I get a motorcycle with it? Is it served in Jesus's shoe?

1048
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:18,761
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Can I sit in your lap?

1049
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:19,921

1053
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:30,087
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We're having a big foam party later.

1054
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}So sorry.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Drunk bitch. Get her out of here.

1057
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,403
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}She holds her liquor like a five-year-old.

1058
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:42,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm so sorry!

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I have to say that was pretty awesome.

1068
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,491
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- It really was. Put her there. - Put her there!

1069
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,643
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No, put her there.

1070
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,005
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Ah! Don't do that.

1071

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- What? - You just make it odd.

1072
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,123
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm trying not to lash out at you,

1073

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and you make it really impossible.

1074
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,282
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- What was that about? - We got company.

1075
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,685
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, shit.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No, I was a precision driver at Quantico.

1078
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,647
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}They thought I was the instructor... I was that good.

1079

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And because you look evil as shit.

1104
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:00,722
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah, I get it. I'm an albino, so I look like a bad guy, right?

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We've been cramped inside this van for two months.

1129
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,571
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We're not gonna let you swoop in

1130
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:55,926
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}from nowhere and take all the credit.

1131
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,321
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I don't want to see you two anywhere near this case!

1132
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:00,489
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We have got informants everywhere!

1133
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,324
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We've got surveillance everywhere!

1134
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,686
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We do not need the two of you...

1135
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:06,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}coming in with your estrogen flying at full speed...

1136
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,927
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}sticking out in the middle of broad daylight fucking things up for us!

1137
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:12,651
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Because the two of us are gonna bring these guys in.

1138
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:15,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Fuck you, chalk balls!

1139
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:17,403
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Not even on your birthday, sweetheart.

1140
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,165
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's right, keep walking.

1141
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,685
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}This isn't over.

1142
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:28,001
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}FYI, we women were born with hair on our legs.

1143
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:34,521
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You don't have to stop.

1144
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:35,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What are you doing? Whoa!

1145
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,282
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You want to tell me what was wrong back there?

1146
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:44,361
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Nothing.

1147
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,204
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I saw your face when you watched the footage.

1148
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,647
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It looked like you saw someone you knew. Possibly your brother?

1149
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:54,204
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You did not read that from my fucking face.

1150
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:57,171
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You read my file, didn't you? God, you're an asshole!

1151
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,129
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yes, I read it, but it is my job

1152
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}to know everything about a case,

1153
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:01,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}including who I work with.

1154
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:02,961
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I don't like that.

1155
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,328
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We should talk to him tomorrow.

1156
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:07,645
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Where is he?

1157
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:09,564
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Probably at my parents'.

1158
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,842
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well then... let's go to your parents'.

1159
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,401
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No, I can't go to my parents'.

1160
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:15,767
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Why?

1161
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,649
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm the one that put him in jail.

1162
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,401
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Okay, never mind.

1163
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,362
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's not like I liked doing it.

1164
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:28,245
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}He got mixed up with a lot of really bad people.

1165
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:29,891
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And then he started

1166
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:33,564
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}He started using that shit. I just had to get him out of there.

1167
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,084
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You know, ironically, a lot of people become addicted...

1168
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:39,846
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}when they're in prison. I think it's like...

1169
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:43,243
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}80%-85% of the inmates require treatments.

1170
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,447
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I hate you.

1171
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:46,726
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

1172
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:50,049
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But I actually wasn't finished. I was going to say...

1173
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,928
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Why can't you just be quiet?

1174
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:40,161
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What the F?

1175
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,443
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}These are cloth. They're nice.

1176
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,284
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I could have shot you!

1177
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,165
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, I'm sorry, do you not like someone invading your privacy?

1178
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:51,803
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, come on. I glanced at your file. You broke into my home!

1179
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:54,122
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I care about who I'm working with, too.

1180
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,362
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And it's a little uncomfortable

1181
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:58,363
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}that you feel the need to travel with trophies.

1182
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,045
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's not what you think.

1183
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,567
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}They moved me up here, rented this apartment,

1184
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:03,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and that is all my stuff.

1185
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:07,681
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}These four shitty, sad boxes... this is it? This is your life?

1186
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:08,961
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yes.

1187
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,844
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, God. I don't think that could be any sadder if you...

1188
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}threw it all in the trash bag

1189
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and started dragging it behind you.

1190
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:19,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You use coffee filters for toilet paper at your house.

1191
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,602
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm buying them anyway. They have a dual purpose.

1192
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,325
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's not what they're for.

1193
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:26,324
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah, real fancy-pants. I see it. I see it in here.

1194
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,682
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Looks like you were pretty cool in high school, huh?

1195
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:31,286
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yes. Yes, I was. But what...

1196
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:32,811
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Because you weren't.

1197
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:35,242
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You know what that girl's not? That girl's not cool.

1198
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,721
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}My favorite part is you only have two signatures...

1199
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}both by teachers.

1200
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:43,366
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Mrs. Burke said, "Have a good summer." That's a personal touch.

1201
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,689
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}My real favorite is this one.

1202
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:48,284
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}"It'll get better."

1203
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:50,011
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yes, fine.

1204
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:52,204
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Okay, now we're even.

1205
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,041
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Okay.

1206
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:55,645
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I see you have a cat.

1207
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:58,521
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yep.

1208
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:02,767
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Is he around? Because I'd like to, you know, pet him and stuff.

1209
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:06,642
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}He... ran away, uh, when I was in New York.

1210
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,681
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, God, that kind of tears me up.

1211
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:16,481
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah, it was, um... it was a loss.

1212
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,447
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That cat got one look at your shitty life

1213
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,921
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and said, "No fucking thanks, man..."

1214
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,563
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}"I am outta here!"

1215
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:28,005
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm still kind of just grieving a little bit about it.

1216
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:32,123
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That fucking tabby is an asshole, that's what he is.

1217
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:33,725
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Fuck you!

1218
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:37,686
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah, "Fuck you!" That's what I say to that cat. Goddamn it.

1219
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:45,486
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Such a shitty, shitty little life.

1220
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,564
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You can't even keep a cat.

1221
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,444
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That hurts a little bit.

1222
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:51,563
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- That's just the grief. - No, not the grief.

1223
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:54,246
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's just the pounding a little bit.

1224
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,723
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh. All right. Don't be a dick about it.

1225
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,285
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Thank you for that.

1226
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,881
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}All right, let's hit the road, okay?

1227
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:02,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I've got to change.

1228
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:04,729
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What's the matter with your pantsuit?

1229
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:07,004
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's pajamas.

1230
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:09,163
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, excuse the shit out of me,

1231
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,561
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I didn't realize you slept in a fucking tux.

1232
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:13,644
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Go ahead, get your top hat.

1233
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:36,722
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}This is the place where you're supposed to be civilized!

1234
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,527
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Be a mother for once in your life.

1235
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,923
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, great. This asshole!

1236
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:45,641
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Just take it easy. Hey, Pop.

1237
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hey, pork chop.

1238
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,402
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, well, well. Look who it is!

1239
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:52,604
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}The rat's back in the house. Did you come back to arrest somebody else?

1240
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,963
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You know, I saw Ma throw a can of Diet Coke in the garbage the other day.

1241
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:57,645
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}She didn't recycle it!

1242
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:01,043
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Dad here, he's splicing cable off the neighbors next door.

1243
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:02,287
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Come on now, Mark.

1244
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:03,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Maybe you should fingerprint him.

1245
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,922
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Maybe get yourself some stripes!

1246
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:07,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Petey here, how many songs

1247
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:09,768
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}you download illegally off the Internet? 5,000?

1248
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:11,724
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Ten, twenty thousand. - 20,000!

1249
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:13,962
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Mikey just stole a laptop from his work!

1250
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:16,805
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Stole? I fucking worked there for six weeks. I deserved to take it.

1251
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,962
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Exactly. No health insurance. That balances out.

1252
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,561
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But not you... you'll probably call in the SWAT team!

1253
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:24,007
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Actually, she could, because those are horrible examples.

1254
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,162
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Here are the nuggies!

1255
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:27,321
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Here we go.

1256
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:33,645
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What kind of an animal throws her own brother in jail?

1257
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,082
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- This kind of animal... right here! - Shut up.

1258
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,841
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}How about keeps him from killing himself?

1259
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:39,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I was the only one that got him off the street.

1260
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:40,801
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}None of you fucks did!

1261
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:43,361
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You should never arrest your family!

1262
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,443
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Who the fuck are you? - That's Gina!

1263
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,443
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, tell Gina I'm gonna strangle her at the table!

1264
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:50,001
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}She is my best friend! You touch her, you gotta go through me first.

1265
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:51,491
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Who the fuck are you?

1266
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:53,761
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'll kill you, and kill her with your fucking dead body!

1267
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:56,566
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Everybody calm down. Shannon's right.

1268
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:59,326
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}This one has no business chiming in on a family matter!

1269
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:01,721
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}"This one?" Why are you talking about my girlfriend like that?

1270
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:03,882
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}She wears sweatpants to your mother's dinner!

1271
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Those are her classy sweatpants.

1272
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,961
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}They don't say "Insert Here" on the ass.

1273
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:08,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Her ass is hanging out!

1274
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,243
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Look at her breasts at the table!

1275
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,045
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Welcome home.

1276
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:17,287
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You here to arrest me?

1277
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,407
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I hope not.

1278
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:20,766
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You selling Bibles?

1279
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:22,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No, she's Ashburn.

1280
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:23,921
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Let's go.

1281
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,571
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We need to talk.

1282
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:28,091
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Sit down.

1283
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:44,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Uh, that is one of the better...

1284
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:47,082
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Jesus sports-themed paintings I've seen.

1285
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,601
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's very good. Nice.

1286
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:51,451
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What are you doing at Club Ekko?

1287
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:54,251
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What are you, my mother? How do you know I was there?

1288
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:58,047
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I know everything. Are you already working for those guys again?

1289
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:00,521
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No, this guy Julian, he sent for me

1290
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}because he wants me to start working with him.

1291
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:04,966
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But I told him no, I'm getting a straight job, and it's fine.

1292
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:08,488
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Everybody's cool now. We parted amicably.

1293
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:10,969
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Are you a knock? - I'm sorry?

1294
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,202
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Are you a knock? - A "knock"?

1295
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:14,886
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, I don't know what that is.

1296
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,291
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}A knock.

1297
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Am I speaking fucking Japanese?

1298
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:19,281
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah, listen to him.

1299
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:20,891
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'll sound it out for you.

1300
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:22,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Are you...

1301
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:25,162
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}or are you not...

1302
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:28,163
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}a knock? A fucking knock!

1303
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:30,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Like Johnny Depp in 21 Jump Street.

1304
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:32,607
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Ah, I see! Okay, a narc.

1305
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:35,327
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}A knock, yes! What was I saying?

1306
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:39,121
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I was missing the R.I heard "knock", but apparently there's a C.

1307
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:40,327
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}He said knock!

1308
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,811
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I said fucking knock, right?

1309
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:44,327
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Why are you wearing a long-sleeved flannel? It's hot out.

1310
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:47,006
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm a little fluey. It's nothing.

1311
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,362
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- You want me to break that thumb? - Please, don't! No!

1312
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:50,846
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Mercy. Mercy. Mercy.

00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:52,485
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Straighten that arm.

1314
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:56,122
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It looks worse than it is. It's not a big deal. This guy Julian...

1315
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:57,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}wants me to keep working. They like me.

1316
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:59,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Tell me where I can find Julian right now.

1317
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:00,966
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No. Just stay out of it.

1318
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:04,203
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}They're maniacs. They'll chop you up, or gun you down, or worse.

1319
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,323
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Jason, tell me what you fucking know!

1320
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:07,481
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I don't know anything.

1321
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:12,522
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Okay. Sal Natale.

1322
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,162
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Okay? You know Sal Natale?

1323
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:16,527
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Of course I do.

1324
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:18,444
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}He was gonna steal this huge shipment

1325
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:20,249
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}they got coming in, so they popped him.

1326
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:23,051
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}He's in the trunk of his Caddy under the Charles River Bridge.

1327
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:24,281
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I want you to stay in this house.

1328
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:26,886
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}If I catch you outside, I'll hurt you worse than them.

1329
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What are you? Why are you here?

1330
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:31,002
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm a federal agent. I'm a Special Agent.

1331
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:32,531
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Special, like retarded?

1332
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,407
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We don't use that word. We say "special needs".

1333
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:38,171
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But I have a very high IQ.

1334
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:39,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Are you a boy or a girl?

1335
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:41,571
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's a fair question.

1336
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Uh, I'm... I'm female.

1337
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:44,681
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No kidding.

1338
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:46,046
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}All woman!

1339
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:48,442
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}From the get-go? No operation?

1340
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:49,766
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Um...

1341
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:51,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}From birth, yes.

1342
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:53,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}How you get that close a shave on your face?

1343
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,561
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I need to go, but I'll be back to, um...

1344
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:57,563
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Nice knowing you. - Yeah, thank you.

1345
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:59,928
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yep, that's Sal Natale, all right.

1346
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:03,567
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Bullet hole through the head. That's unusually civilized for them.

1347
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,564
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, they cut out his tongue, too. Ah.

1348
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:08,406
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}There you have it. They like to send a message.

1349
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:10,444
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Did you find the tongue? Sure.

1350
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:12,244
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Shoved it up his anal cavity.

1351
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:14,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's a weird message.

1352
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:16,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}The tip of the tongue was sticking out of the rectum.

1353
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}So it made it appear as if his buttocks

1354
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:19,804
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}were giving the police the raspberry.

1355
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:22,765
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Did they draw googly eyes or anything on his butt cheeks?

1356
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:23,921
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No.

1357
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:28,445
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Seems like kind of an opportunity missed. That would have been funny.

1358
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:32,924
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, I feel that they were just trying to be tongue in cheek.

1359
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:37,209
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}God, don't do that.

1360
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:40,202
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Where are his belongings?

1361
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:44,282
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Any clues as to where the body was killed?

1362
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:46,442
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We're still looking for their base camp.

1363
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:48,489
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, if there's anything on him

1364
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:50,284
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}that will tell us, I will find it.

1365
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:57,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Huh. Is that coke?

1366
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:59,641
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I don't think so. It's more like a coating.

1367
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,121
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Same traces found on all the victims' shoes.

1368
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:03,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- All of them had... - Epoxy powder coating.

1369
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:04,881
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Right?

1370
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:06,041
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's right.

1371
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:09,804
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Each sample was made of the same ingredient. Which means...

1372
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:11,491
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}They were all killed same place.

1373
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:12,641
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Exactly.

1374
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,085
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I checked it out Wow.

1375
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:16,163
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}There are three places that have this kind of powder.

1376
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:18,322
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Paint factory! - Yeah.

1377
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:20,404
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- We all know that. - Well, it's...

1378
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:22,085
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Look at this.

1379
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:25,402
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}This one right here is centered in the location...

1380
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:28,086
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Where all four dead bodies were found!

1381
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,323
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Right. - That's what I thought.

1382
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:31,891
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}This one shut down years ago,

1383
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,291
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}owned by a man by the name of Lief Sa...

1384
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:34,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Sambertineson? - Sagglemint?

1385
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,446
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Samber...? - Old Sagglemint.

1386
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:38,761
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Santino.

1387
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:40,922
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Oh, Santino! Santino... - Santino.

1388
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:43,444
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Is that a derivative of Sagglemint?

1389
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:45,762
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Get me the address to that paint factory ASAP.

1390
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:47,365
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Excuse me, Ashburn? Um...

1391
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,091
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I was wondering...

1392
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:50,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh. This is a little awkward.

1393
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:53,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Uh, it's nothing personal, but as a rule I make it a point...

1394
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,206
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}not to date my co-workers, so... thank you.

1395
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:59,204
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I was wondering if you would not talk to me in that tone.

1396
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:01,968
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh! Yes, of course!

1397
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:03,884
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's a little different.

1398
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:05,451
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I wouldn't. Why would I?

1399
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:07,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Why would you? Really.

1400
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:09,124
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We should go to the paint factory.

1401
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:12,284
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Are we clear here? Because it got real awkward.

1402
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:14,568
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No... I think we're all good. Right?

1403
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Uh... - We're really good.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Because I don't want any bad...

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Don't worry, she won't do it. She won't do anything.

1501
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,243
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}So you want to gamble with your scrotum and your testicles?

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm in it!

1505
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:36,686
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'll tell you what we're gonna do... play a little game.

1506
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:38,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm gonna take out these bullets.

1507
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:41,167
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Except this one. Because this is my favorite.

1508
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:42,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm gonna keep that in there.

1509
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:44,409
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And then you're gonna tell me where Larkin is.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And you're gonna tell me when and where

1511
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:48,682
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}that shipment is coming in. Okay?

1512

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm gonna kill you and everyone you know.

1514
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:57,529
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's not what I asked.

1515
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:59,569
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Straight arrow, take the gun from her!

1516
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:00,721
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Now you want me to save your scrotum?

1517
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:02,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- When is the shipment coming in? - I don't know.

1518
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:03,681
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Ah!

1519

1522
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:11,284
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Tell her! Just tell her where it is!

1523
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:12,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Don't shoot me in the dick!

1524
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:15,242
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I don't know! It's gonna be Wednesday! That's four shots!

1525
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:17,169
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Don't take any more shots!

1526
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:18,964
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Just tell her where it's coming in!

1527
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:20,690

1528
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:22,569
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Enough! Stop it!

1529
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:24,484
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You brought Julian and LeSoire in?

1530
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:26,483
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- You out of your minds? - Wasn't too smart.

1531
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:28,404
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh. So you're not supposed to arrest someone

1532
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:30,528
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}when they commit murder and try and kill you?

1533
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,162
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You wanted us to keep them on the street?

1534
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:35,362
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You shouldn't even have been there!

1535
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:37,522
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Larkin is the big catch, not those two!

1536
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:39,364
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Now we're never gonna be able to...

1537
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:41,124
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Craig! Calm down! We can all hear you.

1538
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:42,691
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah, dogs can hear you.

1539

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Of course dogs can hear me!

1540
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:47,205
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Are you okay? Because you look really pale.

1541
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:48,885
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's a genetic condition!

1542
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:50,121

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Can I have a moment with my agent, please?

1546
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:01,841
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm good.

1547

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Why didn't you alert anyone

1551
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:12,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}once you found evidence of Julian's whereabouts?

1552
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:14,244
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It was an unconfirmed lead.

1553
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:16,402
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I wasn't gonna waste anyone's time until I knew it was real.

1554
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:19,007
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Give it a rest. I want you to stand down...

1555
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:21,925
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}while I figure out how to repair all this shit with the DEA.

1556
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:24,208
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Sir, no, please. I swear I've been doing

1557
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:25,566
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}everything you sent me out here to do.

1558
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:27,046
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We've been doing such good work.

1559
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:29,088
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I know you are.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's just...

1561
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:34,648
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I don't know, it's... never easy when you are involved.

1562
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:44,771
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Fuck that guy.

1563
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:47,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}If you're not in trouble, you're not doing your job.

1564
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:48,961
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah.

1565
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:51,929
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We should go get a drink. Right?

1566
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:53,611
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What's the point of being a cop

1567
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:55,091
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}if you can't get one drink at the end of the night?

1568
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:56,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's what I'm talking about!

1569
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,131
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I said I just want one.

1570
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:00,403
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, no, no, here... it is one.

1571
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:02,847
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Sometimes he just likes to do this thing where...

1572
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:06,681
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}he pours them in three little glasses, but it's one.

1573
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:09,641
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}All right, here we go!

1574
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:11,651
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Let's loosen that up.

1575
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:12,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Okey-dokey.

1576
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:19,801
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}There you go.

1577
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,002
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- There you go. Keep a pace. - Okay.

1578
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:24,003
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Don't spit that shit out. It's not free.

1579
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:25,366
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Let's go.

1580
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,011
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Keep that in.

1581
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:28,727
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Ooh.

1582
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:32,168
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hey, how you doing? I haven't heard from you.

1583
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:33,811
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Shit.

1584
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,323
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No, you haven't.

1585
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:39,007
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, did I do something wrong, or...

1586
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:43,767
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Okay, here we go.

1587
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:45,764
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's not you, it's me.

1588
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:48,762
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Uh, I'm still working on myself.

1589
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:51,844
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}So I can't be a part of two until I'm a better one.

1590
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:53,411
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You don't have to do that.

1591
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:54,766
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, wait. My favorite's coming.

1592
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,081
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh.

1593
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:58,527
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You make me want to be a better woman.

1594
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:00,251
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I thought we had a good time.

1595
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:05,003
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We did have a lot of fun. And now we're gonna move on.

1596
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:06,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Let it go.

1597
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,365
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}All right. Cool.

1598
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:11,523
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No hard feelings, right?

1599
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:23,042
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Okay, hit it. Hit it.

1600
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:27,127
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Bye.

1601
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:30,964
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I didn't know how else to say it. It's pretty clear.

1602
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:33,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's why you don't feed strays.

1603
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,131
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Can we get two more...

1604
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:37,966
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}shots?

1605
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:39,361
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Six.

1606
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:44,042
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We should get a few more of these, right?

1607
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:48,684
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I don't know, Mullins. It's hard.

1608
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:50,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I know we're not supposed to say this,

1609
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,326
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}but being a woman in this field is hard.

1610
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:57,726
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Men are just so intimidated by me, which is like... why?

1611
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:02,166
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And then you put your personality on top of that and it is...

1612
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:03,965
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}it is off-putting.

1613
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:07,522
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You know, I was actually married for six some years.

1614
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:09,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Was he a hearing man? - Yes.

1615
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:13,043
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}He didn't understand how much the job meant to me,

1616
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,804
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}so I thought it'd be best to just...

1617
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:17,765
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}be alone rather than to compromise the work.

1618
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,331
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I get that.

1619
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:24,086
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's kind of weird that it does get lonely... a little bit.

1620
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:27,607
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's hard to make female friends.

1621
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,842
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I hung out, you know...

1622
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,527
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}really just with my brothers and stuff growing up and...

1623
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:36,525
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}they just all turned out to be terrible people.

1624
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:37,761
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}So that's kind of a bummer.

1625
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:40,042
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Your family loves you.

1626
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:43,206
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I mean, in their own unique way,

1627
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:45,203
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}but they love you and that's a wonderful...

1628
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:46,361
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Very unique.

1629
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:47,931
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That sounds like it's coming from

1630
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,684
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}somebody that's an only child.

1631
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:52,804
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No, I was actually raised with a lot of children.

1632
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,162
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Other children? What, in a circus?

1633
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:57,283
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No, just in... in the houses.

1634
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:00,329
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, my God.

1635
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,684
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You're a foster kid.

1636
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:04,801
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yes, I was.

1637
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,211
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, my God.

1638
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:08,442
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- No. - Jesus, that clears up a lot.

1639
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:11,364
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Foster kid. That makes sense. That's a tough go of it.

1640
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:13,847
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No, it was totally fine.

1641
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:17,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}There was a lot of benefits to being a foster kid.

1642
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:19,529
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Yeah? - Yeah.

1643
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:22,683
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}On Christmases, there was this local drugstore

1644
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:28,244
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}that would sponsor us and give us little baggies of toiletries and stuff.

1645
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:34,327
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}On Thanksgiving, we would hit these different putt putt golf courses.

1646
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:37,411
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- You'd meet all kinds of... - Other sad kids?

1647
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:39,403
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- No... - Oh, Jesus.

1648
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:44,004
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's the saddest series of images I've ever heard.

1649
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:48,369
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- I don't think it affected me in the long run at all. - At all.

1650
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:49,441
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You're probably fine.

1651
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:53,809
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I can see how maybe it was, like, a little bit, but not anything that's...

1652
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:56,202
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Maybe it has? Oh, God.

1653
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:58,204
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, God, my life!

1654
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,843
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, God.

1655
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:04,761
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}All right. Let it out, that's it.

1656
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:07,202
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Good for you to start working through it.

1657
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:09,362
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I don't feel well. I don't feel well.

1658
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:11,688
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You're not making me feel great.

1659

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}All right... blow it out.

1660
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:16,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Really let it go.

1661
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:18,449
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You've got more than that.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'll step back and see what you assholes can do.

1780
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:22,408
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Go U.S.A. Let's go.

1781
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:24,682
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We got to get my family out. They're gonna kill them.

1782
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:27,042
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'll talk to Hale. The FBI can arrange everything.

1783
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:29,202
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Are you kidding? We got a mole in there.

1784
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:31,044
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm assuming it's the albino, but we don't know.

1785
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:32,121
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It could be Levy.

1786
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:33,805
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It could be somebody from my precinct.

1787
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:35,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It could be your boss, "Puss in Boots."

1788
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:37,966
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We are going in there by ourselves and doing it now.

1789
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:39,804
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Are you with me or not?

1790
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:45,051
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Okay.

1791
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:46,841
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}This is bullshit!

1792
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:49,002
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Why should we uproot our lives because you're an asshole?

1793
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:51,766
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Don't talk to her like that. It's not her fault.

1794
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:53,331
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You want to bring everyone?

1795
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:55,004
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No, but it'd be like "Schindler's List."

1796
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:57,931
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Dad! Come on, we cannot fit that in the car!

1797
01:20:58,120 --> 01:20:59,929
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I don't want them to take my treasures.

1798
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:02,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No, no, no! I thought you were inside.

1799
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:03,681
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Say bye-bye.

1800
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:05,762
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Say bye-bye. No. - I'll call you when I get there.

1801
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:08,642
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- You are so rude. - I know. I'm so sorry.

1802

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- This is my house! - Just go outside.

1803
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:11,525
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Where are you going? Outside! - I'll be right back

1804

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I can see through your shirt.

1805
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:14,371
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, God, are you serious? Oh, my God.

1806
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:15,441
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What are you doing with the bat?

1807
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,921
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Just let 'em try to come over here, Shan. Just let 'em try.

1808
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,365
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}They're not gonna throw soft balls at you.

1809
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:21,204
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}They're gonna shoot you, moron. Get your bag.

1810
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:23,081
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Would you get over yourself for Christ's sake?

1811
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:24,929
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Bring it on, motherfuckers.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No, but if you could make your way around...

1815
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:33,526
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Get out and let me drive. I'm a really good driver!

1816
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:35,445
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Mullins! Your mom.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Our lives are in danger. I may have to change my name.

1818
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:43,125
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}So if you get a call from someone named Carla, it's me!

1819

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}When did you become such a princess?

1820
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,047
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You make it impossible!

1821
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:47,690

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Could she go any slower? Could she physically go slower?

1842
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,206
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}MRS. Go get your girlfriend.

01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:28,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'll rip your pants off!

1872
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:41,407
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}If we just knew where that shipment was coming to,

1873
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:42,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}we would have Larkin and Julian.

1874
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:45,322
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}They would both be there, and we could get them.

1875
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:48,205
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm just happy that Jason is out of there for now.

1876
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:49,561
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah.

1877
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:51,607
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Shame, though.

1878
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:54,251
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Having your brother on the inside would be a coup for us.

1879
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:55,521
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's what you want to say?

1880
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:56,766
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Because you're saying that out loud.

1881
01:23:56,920 --> 01:23:59,924
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You would say exactly the same thing if it wasn't your brother.

1882
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:01,411
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We're done talking about this.

1883
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:03,244
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}So if it was just some random drug dealer,

1884
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:04,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}you wouldn't send him back in?

1885
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:06,284
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}If it was someone like Rojas...

1886
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:08,089
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We're not talking about Rojas.

1887
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:10,447
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We're talking about my brother, you fuckwit.

1888
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:13,251
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We all have a lot to lose if we don't catch Larkin.

1889
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:14,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What do you have to lose?

1890
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:15,481
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I have a lot.

1891
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:17,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Some bullshit promotion?

1892
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:19,283
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You don't give a shit about my family

1893
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:20,691
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}or if Jason gets out there and gets killed.

1894
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:22,524
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I feel you're not being honest.

1895
01:24:22,680 --> 01:24:25,763
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Because nobody forced your brother to get involved with drugs.

1896
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:27,046
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You're an asshole for that.

1897
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:28,849
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Okay, that's not helping, either.

1898
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:30,451
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm trying to create a dialogue.

1899
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:33,046
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Note that I start my statements with "I feel".

1900
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:35,123
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, I feel like you're an asshole.

1901
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:36,441
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You know what I feel?

1902
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:38,807
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I feel that you have worn that shirt every day this week.

1903
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:40,803
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And I feel that you turning it inside out

1904
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}does not make it a new shirt.

1905
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:43,531
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, I feel like it does

1906
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:45,722
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, really? Well, I feel I disagree.

1907
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:47,326
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Must be nice. - What?

1908
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:50,006
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Must be really nice for you to know everything.

1909
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:52,202
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}To be so much smarter than everybody else.

1910
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:54,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I don't profess to know everything, but I do know quite a bit.

1911
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:57,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What I know is accurate and scientifically proven,

1912
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:58,724
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and I share that information with you.

1913
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:00,006
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}If you have a problem with that,

1914
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:01,724
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}tune me out like you always do.

1915
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:03,325
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Help! He's choking!

1916
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:05,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Okay, I've got it.

1917
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:07,969
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Somebody call an ambulance!

1918
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:11,045
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Check his mouth!

1919
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:13,043
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- There's nothing there! - Okay, lay him down.

1920
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:15,362
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Sir, relax. Everything will be fine.

1921
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:17,284
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Let me get his head back.

1922
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:20,284
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}He's choking. I need a knife and a straw, please!

1923
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:22,886
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}A knife and a straw! Why a knife and a straw?

1924
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:25,042
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm going to perform an emergency tracheotomy.

1925
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,281
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'll need a glass of vodka.

1926
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:28,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Vodka! It's a Denny's!

1927
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:29,605
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}For sterilization. Hot water!

1928
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:30,761
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Do you know what you're doing?

1929
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:31,841
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Technically, no...

1930
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:33,649
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}but I've been doing some research

1931
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:35,802
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and I feel fairly confident I know how.

1932
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:37,366
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}He's still choking!

1933
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:39,041
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Sir, what I'm going to do is find your...

1934
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:41,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Please don't put that in there. - Shh. Stop touching me.

1935
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:44,603
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I think the cricothyroid membrane is here. I'll make a small incision...

1936
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:46,444
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Let go of my hand. - Please don't do that.

1937
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:48,329
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm going to make a small incision.

1938
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:52,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}The reason I'm doing this... is because you're choking.

1939
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:55,165
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm gonna cut in... just a little bigger...

1940
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:57,402
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That goes in deeper than I thought.

1941
01:25:57,560 --> 01:25:58,846
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Now I'm going to insert my fingers.

1942
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:00,331
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Don't put your finger in there!

1943
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:03,727
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}There is the membrane.

1944
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:06,645
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's a fucking horror show! Don't put your fingers in there!

1945
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:10,243
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Sir, what I'm going to do is insert the straw in the hole...

1946
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:12,607
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and it will allow the oxygen to get to your brain.

1947
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:15,929
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}In one moment, you will feel the oxygen flow into your brain.

1948
01:26:16,120 --> 01:26:17,804
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's not oxygen.

1949
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:19,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's not oxygen!

1950
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:21,085
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's a lot of blood.

1951
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:24,123
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, my God, there's so much blood!

1952
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:25,481
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I don't know what I'm doing!

1953
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:26,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Stop crying! You did this!

1954
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:28,485
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}When's the ambulance coming?

1955
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:29,766
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I got it! Move!

1956
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:30,961
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm so sorry

1957
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:34,527
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}So much blood!

1958
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:35,647
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You asshole!

1959
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:37,406
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You probably could have just pulled

1960
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:38,811
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}the piece of pancake out of his throat.

1961
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,206
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}He's alive, isn't he?

1962
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:42,567
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I have a cut on my arm from earlier.

1963
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:44,051
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Do you think I should amputate it?
