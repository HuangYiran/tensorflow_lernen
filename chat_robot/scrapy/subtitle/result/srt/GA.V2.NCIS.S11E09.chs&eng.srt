The Zumwalt-class destroyer.

2
00:00:07,866 --> 00:00:09,949
展现了美国海军
Demanding the best from the Navy

3
00:00:09,951 --> 00:00:11,734
及其建造公司的最佳水平
and the companies constructing her.

4
00:00:11,736 --> 00:00:14,320
你们四位代表着下一波
You four represent the next wave

5
00:00:14,322 --> 00:00:17,524
能够提高我们军人生活质量的

6
00:00:17,526 --> 00:00:20,710
美国防务公司
who will improve the lives of our military personnel

7
00:00:20,712 --> 00:00:23,246
让他们更加安全 更好地武装自己
by keeping them safer and better equipping them

8
00:00:23,248 --> 00:00:24,414
从而来保护我们大家
to defend us.

9
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:27,250
各位 携手同行
Gentlemen, together...

10
00:00:27,252 --> 00:00:30,837
我们就是美国海军的未来
we are the future of the United States Navy.

11
00:00:33,424 --> 00:00:35,091
海军部长Porter女士
Madam Secretary Porter,

12
00:00:35,093 --> 00:00:37,477
为什么我们公司的标志比Marc的小
why is my logo smaller than Marc's?

13
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:39,646
Beringer Marine今年
Beringer Marine laid down a million tons

14
00:00:39,648 --> 00:00:41,147
制造了一百万吨的原钢
of raw steel this year.

15
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:42,882
而United Equinox(优耐电子)只做了一枚小螺丝钉
United Equinox made a tiny screw.

16
00:00:44,686 --> 00:00:46,653
我们是做了一枚很小很小的螺丝钉
we made a teeny, tiny screw

17
00:00:46,655 --> 00:00:49,322
这枚螺丝钉能承受1200度的
that could withstand a 1,200 degree

18
00:00:49,324 --> 00:00:50,773
温度变化
temperature swing.

19
00:00:50,775 --> 00:00:53,076
而且我们做了一大堆这样的螺丝钉
And we made a crap-ton of them.

20
00:01:00,551 --> 00:01:03,086
这是另一个戏剧般的环节吗 McGee 
Is this another dramatic touch, McGee?

21
00:01:03,088 --> 00:01:05,237
不是的 部长女士
Not exactly, Madam Secretary.

22
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,006
网络安全技术检测到一个
Network security detected

23
00:01:07,008 --> 00:01:09,125
未经授权的电子传输设备
an unauthorized electronic transmission.

24
00:01:09,127 --> 00:01:11,060
所有程序都自动终止了
Everything shuts down automatically.

25
00:01:11,062 --> 00:01:13,046
有黑客试图从外部入侵吗
Does that mean someone's trying to hack in from the outside?

26
00:01:13,048 --> 00:01:16,099
不 只有内部攻击才会造成封锁
No. Lockdown only happens if the attack's internal.

27
00:01:17,134 --> 00:01:20,436
威胁就在这个屋子里
The threat's in this room.

30
00:01:52,336 --> 00:01:55,004
我重看了《太空城》
【注：007系列的第11部】
I just reread <i>Moonraker.</i>

31
00:01:55,006 --> 00:01:57,640
用了星期日一整天的时间
Spent the whole day reading on Sunday.

32
00:01:57,642 --> 00:01:59,726
不记得上一次像这样是什么时候了
Don't remember the last time that happened.

33
00:01:59,728 --> 00:02:02,395
你看过很多书吗
You read a lot?

34
00:02:02,397 --> 00:02:05,315
你懂的 昨晚我出去喝了一杯
You know, I went out for a drink last night,

35
00:02:05,317 --> 00:02:07,150
然后我遇到了一个女孩
and I met a girl.

36
00:02:08,603 --> 00:02:10,269
她有着迷人的微笑 性感的身材
Great smile, great body.

37
00:02:10,271 --> 00:02:12,522
猜猜看她是做什么工作的
Guess what she does for a living.

38
00:02:14,325 --> 00:02:16,909
我在考虑做个变性手术 Norma 
I'm thinking about getting a sex change, Norma.

39
00:02:16,911 --> 00:02:19,862
你说什么了吗 DiNozzo探员
You say something,Agent DiNozzo?

40
00:02:19,864 --> 00:02:22,982
我只是想找个话题和你聊聊
I'm just trying to make conversation.

41
00:02:22,984 --> 00:02:24,751
-和我吗 -是的
- With me? - Yeah.

42
00:02:24,753 --> 00:02:26,819
我根本没在听
I wasn't listening.

43
00:02:28,655 --> 00:02:29,989
那我们重新开始
Start over.

44
00:02:29,991 --> 00:02:31,791
真的吗
Really?

45
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:39,015
原来我是在和一个职业网球运动员约会
So, I guess it turns out that I'm dating a tennis pro.

46
00:02:39,017 --> 00:02:41,434
想不想知道她是怎么给我电话号码的
Want to know how she gave me her number?

47
00:02:41,436 --> 00:02:43,936
留在了她的枕头上
Boop! Left it on her pillow.

48
00:02:45,774 --> 00:02:47,357
不错吧
Hello.

49
00:02:47,359 --> 00:02:48,808
很不错
That's nice.

50
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,643
就这样吗
That's it?

51
00:02:50,645 --> 00:02:52,228
你还想要怎样
What do you want?

52
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,230
你得给点反应啊
Well, a little something.

53
00:02:54,232 --> 00:02:56,899
讥讽啊 嘲笑啊 鄙视的眼神什么的
Just a jibe, a scoff, a little stink-eye, you know?

54
00:02:56,901 --> 00:02:58,350
我只是...我需要一点回应
I just... I need something.

55
00:02:58,352 --> 00:03:00,019
哪怕你"呸"我一声也好
The riff, the pattere, the "pah."

56
00:03:00,021 --> 00:03:03,456
噢 你刚刚鄙视了我一下 我看到了
Oh, you got a stink-eye in there. I can see it.

57
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:06,492
我只是需要那声"呸"
Listen, I just need the "pah."

58
00:03:07,961 --> 00:03:10,329
McGee探员在哪里
Where's Agent McGee?

59
00:03:10,331 --> 00:03:12,548
不应该把所有重担都交给Tim
The burden shouldn't always fall on Tim.

60
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,250
他承受得太多了
He's suffered enough.

61
00:03:14,252 --> 00:03:15,635
Gibbs探员呢
What about Agent Gibbs?

62
00:03:15,637 --> 00:03:18,221
嘿 老大 我在和一个职业网球运动员约会
Hey, boss, dating a tennis pro.

63
00:03:18,223 --> 00:03:19,639
很不错啊
That's nice.

64
00:03:19,641 --> 00:03:21,474
我们走
Let's go.

65
00:03:21,476 --> 00:03:22,809
看到没
See?

66
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:25,094
又有案子了吗
We got a body?

67
00:03:25,096 --> 00:03:28,881
是信息泄露
It's a breach.

68
00:03:28,883 --> 00:03:30,400
我们不用开车去
We're not driving.

69
00:03:30,402 --> 00:03:31,984
我们要去哪里
Where we going?

70
00:03:31,986 --> 00:03:33,186
楼上
Upstairs.

71
00:03:35,355 --> 00:03:37,323
发生了什么 Leon 
What's happening, Leon?

72
00:03:37,325 --> 00:03:39,025
在安全模式下
In secure mode,

73
00:03:39,027 --> 00:03:43,39
MTAC的传感器不断扫描电子信号
MTAC sensors constantly scan for electronic signals.

74
00:03:43,398 --> 00:03:45,615
如果除我们设备外的其它东西
Anything other than our equipment

75
00:03:45,617 --> 00:03:48,284
发射无线电频率 房间就会被封锁
emits a radio frequency, room goes on lockdown.

76
00:03:48,286 --> 00:03:51,237
在我们找到问题源头前 任何人都不能离开
Nobody's allowed to leave till we find the source.

77
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:52,571
可能是一个监视装置 或是窃听器
Like a surveillance device,a bug.

78
00:03:52,573 --> 00:03:53,673
没错
Right.

79
00:03:53,675 --> 00:03:55,675
-这种事经常发生吗 -不
- Does this happen a lot? - No.

80
00:03:55,677 --> 00:03:58,294
把这种东西带进一个安全级别高的房间 可不是很聪明的做法
Not the brightest idea to bring one into a secure room.

81
00:03:58,296 --> 00:03:59,796
所以他们要检查你两次 Marc
That's why they're gonna check you twice, Marc.

82
00:03:59,798 --> 00:04:00,797
你省省吧 Ward 
Save it, Ward.

83
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,965
这可不是开玩笑的时候
Not exactly the time.

84
00:04:02,967 --> 00:04:05,584
都没有问题
All clear.

85
00:04:05,586 --> 00:04:07,720
我扫描了每个角落 老大 
I've scanned every square inch, boss.

86
00:04:07,722 --> 00:04:11,423
无论是座位 墙壁 计算机操控台 都没有任何非法设备的痕迹
Seats, walls, computer console--no sign of any illicit devices.

87
00:04:11,425 --> 00:04:13,860
-错误警报 软件故障 -可能是
- False alarm? Software glitch? - Possible.

88
00:04:13,862 --> 00:04:15,278
这是不是表明 我们可以
Does that mean we're free to let

89
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,280
让我们重要的商业合作伙伴离开了 主任
our valued corporate partners go, Director?

90
00:04:17,282 --> 00:04:19,148
可以解除封锁了 伙计们
You can take us off lockdown, fellas.

91
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,432
-是 长官 -先生们 请
- Yes, sir. - Gentlemen, please.

92
00:04:29,543 --> 00:04:30,710
又是故障吗
Another malfunction?

93
00:04:30,712 --> 00:04:32,662
我以为你检查过所有人了 DiNozzo探员 
I thought you searched everyone, Agent DiNozzo.

94
00:04:32,664 --> 00:04:34,497
我觉得你不会希望我们
I didn't think you wanted me to pat down

95
00:04:34,499 --> 00:04:36,749
对美国的海军部长搜身吧 长官
the United States Secretary of the Navy, sir.

96
00:04:37,617 --> 00:04:38,918
我现在倒是希望了
Well, I do now.

97
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:46,559
请张开双臂 女士 
Uh, raise your arms, please, ma'am.

98
00:04:46,561 --> 00:04:48,344
请记得 我还要养家糊口的
Just remember,I have mouths to feed.

99
00:04:48,346 --> 00:04:49,929
两条金鱼
Two goldfish.

100
00:04:49,931 --> 00:04:51,463
我是家里唯一的顶梁柱
I'm their only source of income,

101
00:04:51,465 --> 00:04:53,632
并且它们 它们无比可爱
and they're-they're awfully cute.

102
00:04:53,634 --> 00:04:56,102
放轻松 DiNozzo 我和你一样迫不及待
Relax, DiNozzo. I'm as anxious about this as you are.

103
00:05:05,996 --> 00:05:08,531
我必须要检查下你的口袋 女士 
I'm gonna have to search your pockets, ma'am.

104
00:05:08,533 --> 00:05:10,416
你是否携带任何尖锐的东西
Do you have any needles or sharp objects?

105
00:05:10,418 --> 00:05:11,483
我必须得问
I have to ask.

106
00:05:11,485 --> 00:05:13,753
没有 你继续吧
No. Proceed.

107
00:05:21,428 --> 00:05:22,962
一只笔
A pen?

108
00:05:22,964 --> 00:05:26,132
我还真担心了一阵子呢 先生们 
You had me worried for a moment, gentlemen.

109
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:33,856
这鬼东西是什么
The the hell's that?

110
00:05:33,858 --> 00:05:36,776
第一印象 这是个闪存盘
Well, first impression,it's a flash drive

111
00:05:36,778 --> 00:05:38,677
连接到一个针孔麦克风
connected to a pinhole microphone.

112
00:05:38,679 --> 00:05:40,396
我们找到窃听器了
We got our bug.

113
00:05:40,398 --> 00:05:42,615
我就是那个漏洞
I'm the breach.

114
00:05:55,608 --> 00:05:57,294
我们先把话说明吧
Okay, let's clear the air right now.

115
00:05:57,295 --> 00:06:00,796
我不知道是何时或何地得到这支笔的
I have no idea when or where I got that pen.

116
00:06:00,798 --> 00:06:02,598
可能是在医生的办公室 银行 或者餐厅
Could have been a doctor's office, bank, restaurant.

117
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,433
我记得最后一次用它
The last time I remember using it

118
00:06:04,435 --> 00:06:06,185
是昨天早上为我女儿
was when I signed a permission slip

119
00:06:06,187 --> 00:06:08,187
签一份同意书的时候
for my daughter yesterday morning.

120
00:06:08,189 --> 00:06:10,356
在那之后 我一定是把笔放进了口袋
And I must have put the pen in my pocket after that,

121
00:06:10,358 --> 00:06:13,359
但我不知道它在录音
but I had no idea it was recording me.

122
00:06:13,361 --> 00:06:15,811
好的
Okay.

123
00:06:16,696 --> 00:06:18,447
你相信我的话
You believe that?

124
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:20,533
-是的 -为什么
- Yes. - Why?

125
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:27,856
因为尊重
Respect.

126
00:06:27,858 --> 00:06:29,524
对你 以及这个部门的尊重
For you and the office.

127
00:06:29,526 --> 00:06:31,693
除非有确凿证据
And until there's evidence to the contrary,

128
00:06:31,695 --> 00:06:34,129
否则就假定你是无辜的 部长女士 
you'll get the benefit of the doubt, Madam Secretary.

129
00:06:34,131 --> 00:06:36,198
谢谢你 Gibbs探员
Thank you, Agent Gibbs.

130
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,051
现在要做的事 是在信息泄露之前追查
Job now is finding who's responsible

131
00:06:39,053 --> 00:06:40,636
谁对这起窃听事件负有责任
before anything leaks.

132
00:06:40,638 --> 00:06:43,672
我昨天在秘密场所参加了
I had classified briefings

133
00:06:43,674 --> 00:06:46,725
国防部的三场机密情报会议
at three D.O.D. off-site locations yesterday,

134
00:06:46,727 --> 00:06:49,061
而且我们所探讨的部署策略
and we talked enough deployment strategy

135
00:06:49,063 --> 00:06:50,879
能够对海军和海军陆战队
to cause serious security problems

136
00:06:50,881 --> 00:06:53,065
造成严重的安全问题
for the sailors and Marines I work for.

137
00:06:53,067 --> 00:06:56,986
请你理解 他们的安危是我唯一关心的 Gibbs探员
Understand, they are my only concern in this, Agent Gibbs.

138
00:07:03,494 --> 00:07:06,111
Abby已经拿了那只窃听笔 老大 
Abby's got the spy pen, boss.

139
00:07:06,113 --> 00:07:09,564
根据电池容量以及剩余电量分析
Based on the battery size and the length of the charge left,

140
00:07:09,566 --> 00:07:12,418
我们认为它录音了将近30个小时左右
we think it's been recording for about 30 hours or so.

141
00:07:14,371 --> 00:07:15,621
我们能追踪到是谁在窃听吗
Can we track who's listening?

142
00:07:15,623 --> 00:07:16,622
这不是现场直播
It's not a live feed.

143
00:07:16,624 --> 00:07:17,957
窃听器只存储信息
The bug stores the data internally,

144
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:19,425
这意味着安置窃听器的人
which means whoever planted it

145
00:07:19,427 --> 00:07:20,876
必须得下载这些信息
has to download the info.

146
00:07:20,878 --> 00:07:23,412
我们必须假设他们已经这么做了
Which we have to assume they've already done.

147
00:07:23,414 --> 00:07:25,798
好吧 我会警示五角大楼
All right, I will alert the Pentagon that my meetings

148
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,882
昨天的会议内容被泄露了
yesterday were compromised.

149
00:07:26,884 --> 00:07:28,934
我们应该和NSA共同处理这个问题
【注：NSA 美国国家安全局】
And we should bring in the NSA.

150
00:07:28,936 --> 00:07:31,220
我刚刚提出了这个请求
I just put in a request for info.

151
00:07:31,222 --> 00:07:34,089
让他们时刻警惕有关出卖美国情报的问题
They got ears open for the sale of U.S. intel.

152
00:07:34,091 --> 00:07:35,140
我们尽力不要让事情发展到那个地步
Let's make sure it doesn't get that far.

153
00:07:35,142 --> 00:07:36,425
我跟着你做 老大
You zig, I zag, boss.

154
00:07:36,427 --> 00:07:38,277
我在和NSA通电话时
While I was on the horn with NSA,

155
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:40,112
调出了一份威胁分析报告
I pulled a threat analysis report.

156
00:07:40,114 --> 00:07:42,531
他们在十分钟内就做了这份报告吗
They put this together in the last ten minutes?

157
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:44,433
不 这报告在两年前就完成了
No. The paper's two years old.

158
00:07:44,435 --> 00:07:46,368
但是它准确地预言了我们这次的泄露事件
But it predicts our breach exactly.

159
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:48,537
"秘密录音装置"
"Clandestine recording device,

160
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:50,939
"高级别的政府官员"
"high-level government official,

161
00:07:50,941 --> 00:07:52,875
"一件日常用品
"an everyday item

162
00:07:52,877 --> 00:07:55,077
例如一支钢笔"
such as an ink pen."

163
00:07:56,379 --> 00:07:57,663
巧合吗
Coincidence?

164
00:07:57,665 --> 00:08:01,450
我们得和写这份报告的人谈一谈
We need to talk to the person who wrote this paper.

165
00:08:10,226 --> 00:08:12,594
我还以为要经过全面细致地搜身才能进来这里呢
I thought we were gonna get a cavity search coming in here.

166
00:08:12,596 --> 00:08:14,930
真有趣
Interesting.

167
00:08:14,932 --> 00:08:16,098
嗯
Hmm.

168
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,600
哇 看那里
Whoa, look at that.

169
00:08:18,602 --> 00:08:22,521
我们最好别告诉McGee 这里有《星际迷航》游戏里的椅子
We better not tell McGee about the <i>Star Trek</i> video game chairs.

170
00:08:22,523 --> 00:08:25,307
他会疯了的
It'll just irritate him.

171
00:08:25,309 --> 00:08:27,776
这儿就像是苹果直营店
It's like an Apple Store.

172
00:08:27,778 --> 00:08:29,445
你们一定是NCIS吧
You must be NCIS.

173
00:08:29,447 --> 00:08:31,747
欢迎来到国家安全操控中心
Welcome to the National Security Operations Center.

174
00:08:31,749 --> 00:08:34,199
我是NSA特别探员 Chad Flynderling
I'm NSA Special Agent Chad Flynderling.

175
00:08:34,201 --> 00:08:35,434
你们可以叫我Flynn
You can call me Flynn.

176
00:08:35,436 --> 00:08:36,535
Flynn
Flynn.

177
00:08:36,537 --> 00:08:38,337
就像电影《创战纪》里的Jeff Bridges吗
【注：在电影中Jeff Bridges饰演的角色名叫Kevin Flynn】
Like Jeff Bridges in <i>Tron?</i>

178
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:41,206
真新颖啊
That's original.

179
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:42,841
抱歉
Sorry. I'm sorry.

180
00:08:42,843 --> 00:08:45,627
我现在对NSA的公众认知度很敏感
I'm sensitive to NSA's public perception right now.

181
00:08:45,629 --> 00:08:48,497
我们可不是一群不问世事 只懂数据的书呆子
We're not just a bunch of reclusive data nerds.

182
00:08:48,499 --> 00:08:51,266
我们的员工就像这里的工作一样 多种多样
Our employees are as diverse as the work that we do here.

183
00:08:51,268 --> 00:08:53,335
而且我发誓 要是我再听到
And I swear,if I have to hear another crack

184
00:08:53,337 --> 00:08:54,603
一句关于《星际迷航》椅子的笑话...
about the <i>Star Trek</i> chairs...

185
00:08:54,605 --> 00:08:56,505
嘿 看那些
Oh, hey, look at those.

186
00:08:56,507 --> 00:08:58,273
根本就没注意到哎
Didn't even notice them.

187
00:08:58,275 --> 00:09:00,726
我重新读了你所说的那份威胁分析报告
I reviewed the threat report you called about.

188
00:09:00,728 --> 00:09:02,644
-是你写的吗 -不是
- You write it? - Well, no.

189
00:09:02,646 --> 00:09:04,863
不过我可以协助你
Uh, but I can assist you with anything you might need.

190
00:09:04,865 --> 00:09:07,199
我们需要见报告的原作者
We asked for the original author.

191
00:09:09,619 --> 00:09:11,787
就这么办 一号
【注；《星际迷航》中Picard船长的口头禅】
Make it so, Number One.

192
00:09:13,623 --> 00:09:14,573
有什么问题吗
What's the problem?

193
00:09:14,575 --> 00:09:16,325
呃...
Uh...

194
00:09:16,327 --> 00:09:20,546
关于我提及的那些不问世事的数据书呆子...
About those reclusive data freaks I was talking about...

195
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:43,051
这情况会持续多久
So how long does this go on?

196
00:09:43,053 --> 00:09:45,904
稍等一下
Yeah, just wait for it.

197
00:09:54,615 --> 00:09:56,115
Gibbs探员 DiNozzo探员
Uh, Agents Gibbs and DiNozzo,

198
00:09:56,117 --> 00:09:58,066
这是我们NSA的分析员
give you NSA Analyst

199
00:09:58,068 --> 00:09:59,201
Ellie Bishop
Ellie Bishop.

200
00:09:59,203 --> 00:10:00,919
她喜欢在这里做一些
She prefers to do her

201
00:10:00,921 --> 00:10:02,871
非机密的研究工作
unclassified research in here.

202
00:10:02,873 --> 00:10:05,407
我们讨论过第一条规定的 Flynn
I thought we discussed rule number one, Flynn.

203
00:10:05,409 --> 00:10:07,760
如果我带着耳机 就闪一下台灯
When my earbuds are in, flash the desk light.

204
00:10:07,762 --> 00:10:08,794
我也是没办法
Couldn't help it.

205
00:10:08,796 --> 00:10:10,345
我是Bishop
Bishop.

206
00:10:10,347 --> 00:10:12,381
很高兴见到你
It's good to meet you.

207
00:10:12,383 --> 00:10:16,051
不好意思 我正在处理一些...事情
Sorry, I was in the middle of... stuff.

208
00:10:17,103 --> 00:10:19,438
对 这是我写的 怎么了
Yup. That's my work. What's up?

209
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,589
你连看都没看
You didn't even look at it.

210
00:10:20,591 --> 00:10:22,424
这是我进NSA上班的第三天写的
I wrote it my third day at the NSA.

211
00:10:22,426 --> 00:10:23,475
一个星期三的早晨
It was a Wednesday morning.

212
00:10:23,477 --> 00:10:26,028
我刚吃完一盒可可麦片
I just finished a box of Cocoa Pebbles.

213
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,947
我记得这些 是因为
I remember that because it was

214
00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:31,283
包装盒里的礼物给了我撰写报告的灵感
the prize inside the box that inspired the entire paper.

215
00:10:31,285 --> 00:10:33,535
让我猜猜 一支钢笔
Let me guess. A pen?

216
00:10:33,537 --> 00:10:35,437
一件隐藏在眼皮底下的日常用品
An everyday object hiding in plain sight.

217
00:10:35,439 --> 00:10:37,456
就这样有了灵感
It clicked.

218
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,958
所以 你通过一个早餐麦片的盒子
So you got 25 pages of national security strategy

219
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,611
写下了25页有关国家安全策略的报告
from inside a breakfast cereal?

220
00:10:42,613 --> 00:10:44,329
为了更好地应对袭击
In order to better prepare for attacks,

221
00:10:44,331 --> 00:10:46,081
我会假想还没有发生的威胁
I dream up threats that haven't happened yet.

222
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,382
你的假想成真了
This dream came true.

223
00:10:47,384 --> 00:10:49,802
所以我是对的
So I was right.

224
00:10:51,554 --> 00:10:52,787
海军部长身上被装了窃听器
Secretary of the Navy was bugged.

225
00:10:52,789 --> 00:10:55,790
安全情报陷入危机
Security intel is at risk.

226
00:10:55,792 --> 00:10:58,260
这太糟糕了
Which is bad.

227
00:10:58,262 --> 00:11:00,679
但是我把报告提交给上司
But I submit my reports to my superiors,

228
00:11:00,681 --> 00:11:02,314
他们再将那些报告分发给各个部门
who then distribute them accordingly.

229
00:11:02,316 --> 00:11:05,100
任何有基本安全权限的人都可以阅读
Anyone with basic security clearance could have access.

230
00:11:05,102 --> 00:11:06,115
你给别人看过这份报告吗
Did you give this paper to anybody else?

231
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,438
没有
No.

232
00:11:08,321 --> 00:11:10,639
你是在问我是否跟窃听事件有关系吗
Are you asking if I'm in on it or something?

233
00:11:13,661 --> 00:11:15,160
呃 我没有 我...
Uh, no, I-I'm not, I...

234
00:11:15,162 --> 00:11:16,662
我写剧本
I wrote the playbook, but I have

235
00:11:16,664 --> 00:11:18,030
但我不知道谁在付诸行动
no idea who's running it.

236
00:11:19,582 --> 00:11:21,116
对不起
Sorry.

237
00:11:21,118 --> 00:11:23,502
希望你们能找到那个人
Hope you find your guy.

238
00:11:23,504 --> 00:11:25,671
很高兴见到你们
It was nice to meet you.

239
00:11:29,627 --> 00:11:30,825
像我说的
Like I said,

240
00:11:30,827 --> 00:11:32,461
她不是一个外勤探员
she's not a field agent.

241
00:11:32,463 --> 00:11:33,712
我能听见你说话 Jeff Daniels
【注：美国演员 出演美剧《新闻编辑室》里的主播】
I can still hear you, Jeff Daniels.

242
00:11:33,714 --> 00:11:34,829
Jeff Daniels不在《创战纪》里
Jeff Daniels wasn't in <i>Tron.</i>

243
00:11:34,831 --> 00:11:36,598
应该是Jeff Bridges
That was Jeff Bridges.

244
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,134
Flynn 你的确是粉丝
Flynn, you <i>are</i> a fan.

245
00:11:39,136 --> 00:11:40,669
什么事 Duck
Yeah, Duck?

246
00:11:41,888 --> 00:11:44,273
嗯 我们这就回去
Yep, we're on our way back.

247
00:11:44,275 --> 00:11:46,024
我们发现了另一支窃听笔
We have got a second pen.

248
00:11:46,026 --> 00:11:47,309
我想这意味着
So I guess this means

249
00:11:47,311 --> 00:11:48,727
-我得跟你们一起回去 -不
- I'm riding with you guys.- No.

250
00:11:48,729 --> 00:11:49,862
她跟我们一起走
No, but she is.

251
00:11:49,864 --> 00:11:51,947
什么 为什么
What? Why?

252
00:11:55,535 --> 00:11:58,019
因为 就像你说的
'Cause, like you said,

253
00:11:58,021 --> 00:12:00,989
你写了这个剧本 是吧
you wrote the playbook, right?

254
00:12:13,586 --> 00:12:15,537
我们在这里干什么
What are we doing here?

255
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:17,756
我在等Ducky 我们的M.E
I'm waiting for Ducky, our M.E.

256
00:12:19,092 --> 00:12:20,709
就是法医
That stands for "medical examiner."

257
00:12:20,711 --> 00:12:24,062
我不是第一次参与案件
This isn't my first case.

258
00:12:24,064 --> 00:12:26,548
我是说 我在这里干什么
I meant, what am <i>I</i> doing here?

259
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:28,383
我分析全方位的数据
I analyze big-picture data,

260
00:12:28,385 --> 00:12:31,653
在全球反恐战争中提供详细的策略
present detailed strategies in the global war on terror.

261
00:12:32,722 --> 00:12:35,657
或许得花很多年才能真正落实的棋局
Chess moves that can take years to implement.

262
00:12:35,659 --> 00:12:37,492
你喜欢玩棋盘游戏
You enjoy playing board games?

263
00:12:38,946 --> 00:12:41,530
听着 我所能告诉你的一切都在那份报告里
Look, everything I can offer you is in that report.

264
00:12:41,532 --> 00:12:43,064
我本人在这里能起什么作用
What good can I do in person?

265
00:12:43,066 --> 00:12:44,750
我不知道 但是你可以
I don't know,but you can start

266
00:12:44,752 --> 00:12:46,168
开始读这份卷宗 赶上我们的进度
by catching up on the case file.

267
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:47,536
没错
Yes.

268
00:12:47,538 --> 00:12:50,038
那你能告诉我要多长时间吗
Well, then, can you tell me how long?

269
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,924
我当然能等
Of course I can hold on.

270
00:12:51,926 --> 00:12:54,843
我觉得你不是FBI 也不是来告诉我
I don't suppose you're from the FBI and you've come to tell me

271
00:12:54,845 --> 00:12:56,428
整件事情都是误会
that all this is a misunderstanding?

272
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:57,512
不好意思 我来自NSA 名叫...
Sorry, NSA. My name...

273
00:12:57,514 --> 00:12:59,765
这毫不相干
That is totally irrelevant.

274
00:12:59,767 --> 00:13:02,134
10分钟之前我还跟他说过话
I was just talking to the man ten minutes ago.

275
00:13:02,136 --> 00:13:04,636
特区法医在躲我的电话
The D.C. M.E. is dodging my calls.

276
00:13:04,638 --> 00:13:06,688
Duck 我以为这是关于另一个窃听器
Duck, I thought this was about another bug,

277
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:08,590
-而不是一具尸体 -两者皆是
- not a body.- It's both.

278
00:13:08,592 --> 00:13:12,311
多亏了我们的搜查令 法医重新检查
Thanks to our BOLO, the M.E. found a second pen

279
00:13:12,313 --> 00:13:15,096
他的个人物品时 发现了第二只钢笔
when he went back through this man's personal effects.

280
00:13:15,098 --> 00:13:16,281
他是Claude Sherman
He's Claude Sherman,

281
00:13:16,283 --> 00:13:17,316
优耐电子公司的会计师
accountant for United Equinox Electronics.

282
00:13:17,318 --> 00:13:19,034
是的 他就职于
Yeah, he worked

283
00:13:19,036 --> 00:13:21,069
今早出现在MTAC的公司之一
for one of the companies in MTAC this morning.

284
00:13:21,071 --> 00:13:22,621
谋杀
Murder?

285
00:13:22,623 --> 00:13:24,239
不 自然死亡
No, natural causes.

286
00:13:24,241 --> 00:13:26,908
两天前死于心肌梗塞
Myocardial infarction two days ago.

287
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:27,942
Ducky 为什么他出现在这里
Ducky, then what's he doing here?

288
00:13:27,944 --> 00:13:29,328
尸体和个人物品一起运送
Body and personal effects travel together

289
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,046
以保证证据的完整性
in order to preserve the chain of evidence.

290
00:13:32,165 --> 00:13:34,049
我说过 这不是我的第一个案子
Like I said,this is not my first case.

291
00:13:34,051 --> 00:13:35,667
等一下
Stop.

292
00:13:35,669 --> 00:13:37,502
-Ducky 钢笔在哪里 -不见了
- Ducky, where's the pen? - It's missing.

293
00:13:37,504 --> 00:13:40,222
所以我整个早晨都在打电话
That's why I've been on the phone all morning.

294
00:13:49,098 --> 00:13:50,649
根据 
Yeah, according

295
00:13:50,651 --> 00:13:51,900
法医办公室的说法
to the M.E.'s office,

296
00:13:51,902 --> 00:13:54,269
一位FBI探员在09:15转运之前
an FBI agent collected the personal effects

297
00:13:54,271 --> 00:13:57,022
搜集了所有的个人物品
just before the transfer at 0915.

298
00:13:57,024 --> 00:13:59,274
问题在于 当我打电话确认的时候
The problem is,when I called to confirm,

299
00:13:59,276 --> 00:14:01,309
这位FBI根本就不知道这件事情
the FBI doesn't know anything about it.

300
00:14:01,311 --> 00:14:03,311
-有人假冒FBI探员 -看来就是这样
- Somebody posing as an agent. - It would appear so.

301
00:14:03,313 --> 00:14:06,665
给我们留下一具尸体和更多的疑问
Leaving us a body and more questions.

302
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:08,333
谁偷了这只钢笔
Who stole the pen?

303
00:14:08,335 --> 00:14:09,918
跟在海军部长身上装窃听器的
Was it the same person who planted it

304
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,253
是同一个人吗
on SECNAV?

305
00:14:12,655 --> 00:14:14,089
有什么联系呢
What's the connection?

306
00:14:14,091 --> 00:14:18,043
不好意思 你的名字是什么
I'm sorry...what was your name again?

307
00:14:18,045 --> 00:14:18,960
Bishop
Bishop.

308
00:14:20,179 --> 00:14:21,596
你想到些什么
You got something?

309
00:14:21,598 --> 00:14:23,498
呃 也许
Yeah, uh, maybe.

310
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,801
你这里有吃的吗
You got any food around here?

311
00:14:26,602 --> 00:14:27,886
什么都行
Anything?

312
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,641
总能找到些东西 走吧
We'll find stuff. Come on.

313
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,232
五角大楼拒绝透露 海军部长参加的情报会议记录
Pentagon refuses to release any of the minutes
from SECNAV's briefings.

315
00:14:40,234 --> 00:14:42,116
一旦情报泄露 整个世界都会知道
Once the intel leaks, the whole world will know.

316
00:14:42,118 --> 00:14:43,702
我就是这么跟他们说的
Yeah, it's what I told them,

317
00:14:43,704 --> 00:14:46,020
但他们仅能透露的是 讨论的话题
except all they could say was, topics of discussion

318
00:14:46,022 --> 00:14:48,874
包括俄罗斯 中国 叙利亚跟伊朗
included Russia, China, Syria and Iran.

319
00:14:48,876 --> 00:14:49,991
真是缩小了范围啊
That narrows it down.

320
00:14:49,993 --> 00:14:51,743
是啊
Yeah.

321
00:14:51,745 --> 00:14:52,711
就是她
That her?

322
00:14:52,713 --> 00:14:53,995
她摔倒了吗
She fall down?

323
00:14:55,249 --> 00:14:57,332
哦 别被这里的一片混乱蒙蔽了
Oh, uh, don't let the chaos fool you.

324
00:14:57,334 --> 00:14:59,418
这只是我的工作方式
This is just how I work.

325
00:15:00,303 --> 00:15:02,554
好吧 Jeff Goldblum
【注：美国演员 出演过电影《变蝇人》】
All right, Jeff Goldblum,

326
00:15:02,556 --> 00:15:04,673
有人在海军部长身上装了窃听器 
guy plants a bug on SECNAV,

327
00:15:04,675 --> 00:15:05,707
上传了数据
uploads the data.

328
00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:06,808
他用来做什么呢
What's he do with it?

329
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:08,927
你说
Go.

330
00:15:08,929 --> 00:15:10,929
你读过我的报告吗
Did you read my paper?

331
00:15:10,931 --> 00:15:12,547
看了一点 但是我...
Some... some of it, but I...

332
00:15:12,549 --> 00:15:15,434
时间很紧迫 而且我...
Time is a factor here,and I...

333
00:15:16,436 --> 00:15:18,403
那是婚戒吗 你结婚了
Is that a wedding ring? Are you married?

334
00:15:18,405 --> 00:15:20,572
今晚我会把报告给你 可以吗
I'll have my report to you by tonight, okay?

335
00:15:20,574 --> 00:15:21,857
-报告 -嗯
- Report? - Mm-hmm.

336
00:15:21,859 --> 00:15:22,891
今晚
Tonight?

337
00:15:22,893 --> 00:15:24,076
等等 我从头理一下
Wait, let's back the truck up.

338
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:25,444
你多大了
How old are you?

339
00:15:25,446 --> 00:15:26,995
嘿 不是说时间很紧迫吗
Ha.I thought time was a factor around here.

340
00:15:26,997 --> 00:15:28,830
讨论我的个人生活不是浪费时间吗
Isn't talking about my personal life a waste of it?

341
00:15:28,832 --> 00:15:29,865
-不是 -是
- No. - Yes.

342
00:15:29,867 --> 00:15:31,287
在我看来 窃听的人有三个选择
Well, the way I see it, our guy has three options.

343
00:15:31,289 --> 00:15:33,085
第一 他把这些
One: he releases

344
00:15:33,087 --> 00:15:35,170
信息全部泄露
the information in the name of full disclosure.

345
00:15:35,172 --> 00:15:36,237
那我们应该已经听到风声了
Which he would have already done.

346
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:37,789
第二 他把这些信息卖给敌人
Two: he sells the data to the enemy.

347
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,040
但是他事先并不知道
Except he had no way of knowing

348
00:15:39,042 --> 00:15:40,459
窃听到的会是什么情报
what kind of intel the bug would record.

349
00:15:40,461 --> 00:15:42,210
-需要找到正确的买家 -这会花很多时间
- Needs to find the right buyer. - Which takes time.

350
00:15:42,212 --> 00:15:43,745
剩下第三个选择
Leaving us with option three:

351
00:15:43,747 --> 00:15:45,714
他把信息反过来卖给我们
he sells the information back to us.

352
00:15:45,716 --> 00:15:47,081
勒索
Extortion.

353
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:49,684
额 等一下 这...这仅仅是个猜测
Yeah, uh, wait, tha-that...that was just a guess.

354
00:15:49,686 --> 00:15:50,919
我们需要提醒海军部长办公室
We need to alert the SECNAV's office

355
00:15:50,921 --> 00:15:51,887
这个人可能会打电话
this guy might be calling.

356
00:15:51,889 --> 00:15:53,588
-他已经打了 -勒索
- He just did. - Extortion?

357
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,140
记时已经开始
Clock's already started.

358
00:16:07,691 --> 00:16:10,894
中午12:30 海军部长办公室
12:30 p.m., SECNAV's office was contacted

359
00:16:10,895 --> 00:16:12,561
收到一封加密邮件
via an encrypted e-mail.

360
00:16:12,563 --> 00:16:14,863
我们有一个小时的时间 将一千万
We have one hour to deposit $10 million

361
00:16:14,865 --> 00:16:17,366
存到一个离岸账户 不然他就泄露情报
【注：在境外银行开立的账户 客户可以从离岸账户上自由调拨资金而不受本国的外汇管制】  
into an offshore account or he leaks the intel.

362
00:16:17,368 --> 00:16:18,484
我们能追踪这个邮件吗
Can we track the communication?

363
00:16:18,486 --> 00:16:19,785
不行 幕后之人
No, who's ever behind this knows their way

364
00:16:19,787 --> 00:16:21,269
懂计算机代码 也知道如何隐藏行踪
around computer code and knows how to hide.

365
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:22,237
我们有多大几率
What are the chances

366
00:16:22,239 --> 00:16:24,106
能在一小时内抓住这个家伙
of catching this guy before the deadline?

367
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,492
如果直接把钱付给他 几率会更高
Well, they get better if we just pay him.

368
00:16:28,912 --> 00:16:31,497
-给他想要的 -不
- Give the man what he wants.- No.

369
00:16:31,499 --> 00:16:32,464
我们可不喜欢
We don't like

370
00:16:32,466 --> 00:16:34,216
给恐怖分子任何东西
giving terrorists anything,

371
00:16:34,218 --> 00:16:36,284
更不用说是纳税人的钱
much less taxpayer money.

372
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:38,286
我也是 但是就像我在NSA告诉上司的那样
Neither do I,but like I told my boss at NSA,

373
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:39,672
这是做生意必须付出的代价
it's the cost of doing business.

374
00:16:39,674 --> 00:16:41,390
如果我们往账户里存了钱
If we deposit the money into the account

375
00:16:41,392 --> 00:16:43,809
而他进入账户 我们就有机会追踪他
and he accesses it, it gives us something to trace.

376
00:16:43,811 --> 00:16:44,843
在我的报告里都概述过了
It's all outlined in my paper.

377
00:16:44,845 --> 00:16:47,179
有可能我们的间谍正用同一份报告
Would that be the same paper our spy

378
00:16:47,181 --> 00:16:48,897
作为他的行动步骤
could be using as a paint-by-numbers?

379
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:50,099
他知道这是我们的策略
He'll know that's our strategy.

380
00:16:50,101 --> 00:16:51,433
就算没有报告 他也早就猜到了
He would have guessed it anyway,

381
00:16:51,435 --> 00:16:53,268
我们可以用NSA的编码去破解他的
which makes it our NSA codes against his.

382
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:56,689
从统计学上看 这对我们更有利
And statistically,the odds are in our favor.

383
00:16:57,691 --> 00:16:59,608
这是我们找到他的最好办法
It's our best way of finding him.

384
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:00,909
数据统计不会说谎
Statistics don't lie.

385
00:17:00,911 --> 00:17:02,528
-对 但坏人会 -撒谎
- Yeah, but our bad guy might.- Lie?

386
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:03,612
-关于什么 -我们不知道
- About what?- We don't know

387
00:17:03,614 --> 00:17:05,948
关于他的任何信息 或者他到底想要什么
anything about him or what he wants.

388
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:08,584
他想要钱 对吧
He wants money, right?

389
00:17:08,586 --> 00:17:10,419
除非他还想要更多
Unless he hasn't shown his full hand.

390
00:17:11,788 --> 00:17:13,622
继续搜查 直到我们找到他
Keep digging till we find it.

391
00:17:13,624 --> 00:17:16,208
这根本...根本说不通
That doesn't...doesn't make sense.

392
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:17,710
有些时候你得相信直觉
Sometimes you got to go with your gut.

393
00:17:17,712 --> 00:17:20,045
好吧 但和直觉相比 我想我们都同意
Sure, but gut logic aside, I think we can all agree here

394
00:17:20,047 --> 00:17:22,264
这种情况下 遵循逻辑更好
that actual logic is better.

395
00:17:22,266 --> 00:17:23,632
我们马上就能知道了
Well, we're about to find out.

396
00:17:23,634 --> 00:17:24,600
海军部长刚刚同意了
SECNAV just approved

397
00:17:24,602 --> 00:17:26,051
Bishop的计划
Bishop's game plan.

398
00:17:26,053 --> 00:17:28,604
让NSA来牵头汇款行动
Gave NSA the lead on the money-drop.

399
00:17:29,522 --> 00:17:31,557
Porter有话要跟我们说 Gibbs
Porter wants to have a word with us, Gibbs.

400
00:17:33,676 --> 00:17:35,060
好样的
Good.

401
00:17:49,025 --> 00:17:51,043
同样的监听装置
The same kind of surveillance device

402
00:17:51,045 --> 00:17:53,028
出现在我公司的会计身上
was found on my corporate accountant.

403
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:53,996
我没有在你的雇员身上
I didn't plant

404
00:17:53,998 --> 00:17:55,431
放置窃听器
a bug on your employee,

405
00:17:55,433 --> 00:17:57,633
而且我也绝对没有
and I sure as hell didn't plant a bug

406
00:17:57,635 --> 00:17:59,301
在海军部长的身上放置窃听器
on the Secretary of the Navy!

407
00:17:59,303 --> 00:18:01,153
你胆大包天 竟敢指控我犯叛国罪
You got stones accusing me of treason.

408
00:18:01,155 --> 00:18:02,621
互相责怪是没有用的
There's no sense pointing fingers.

409
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,022
别假装是个爱国者了 Ward
Quit playing the patriot, Ward.

410
00:18:04,024 --> 00:18:07,726
我是一个爱国者 我的公司为这个军队服务了四代人
I am a patriot. My company's been serving this military for four generations.

412
00:18:07,728 --> 00:18:10,395
我们可不是什么发战争财的公司
We're not some startup war profiteer.

413
00:18:10,397 --> 00:18:11,880
够了
That's enough.

414
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,565
我知道你们都担心
I understand you're concerned

415
00:18:13,567 --> 00:18:14,683
公司机密被泄露
about corporate secrets being leaked.

416
00:18:14,685 --> 00:18:16,268
即使没有任何泄露
Even if nothing leaks,

417
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,270
像这样的话传出去也会让我的公司倒闭
word of this would kill me on Wall Street.

418
00:18:18,272 --> 00:18:20,773
我们讨论的是上亿的金钱
We're talking hundreds of millions.

419
00:18:20,775 --> 00:18:22,390
我们正在追踪那个从你员工身上找到的监听器 Marc
We are following up on the device found on your employee, Marc,

420
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:26,061
但你得给我们一点时间来做我们的工作
but give us time to do our jobs.

421
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,395
我可以向你们俩保证
I can assure you both

422
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:29,615
我们最好的探员正在日以继夜地工作
that our best agents are working on this around the clock.

423
00:18:29,617 --> 00:18:31,200
对不对 Gibbs探员
Isn't that right, Agent Gibbs?

424
00:18:32,568 --> 00:18:36,121
哦 我确定你刚刚让我们都出局了 长官
Oh, I'm pretty sure you just took us off the clock, ma'am.

425
00:18:38,758 --> 00:18:42,294
先生们 失陪一下
Gentlemen, if you'll excuse me for a moment.

426
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:46,014
我因为这件事情承受着各方压力
I'm getting hit on all sides with this--

427
00:18:46,016 --> 00:18:47,516
五角大楼 白宫
Pentagon, White House.

428
00:18:47,518 --> 00:18:50,302
人们不需要另一个情报丑闻
【注：指斯诺登的棱镜门】 
Last thing anybody needs is another intel scandal,

429
00:18:50,304 --> 00:18:52,938
而且NSA对这种威胁有所防备
and NSA is prepared for this kind of threat.

430
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,273
我们也是 部长女士
So are we, Madam Secretary.

431
00:18:54,275 --> 00:18:56,424
我希望你能继续以往出色的工作 Leon
And I want you to keep up the good work, Leon.

432
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:59,061
我不是把你当成候补 只是在增加更多的人手
I'm not benching you; I'm just adding more players to the game.

433
00:18:59,063 --> 00:19:01,230
术业有专攻 
Different players have different strengths.

434
00:19:01,232 --> 00:19:06,318
是的 而作为总指挥 我要根据我的方法来编排阵容 主任 
Yes, and as head coach, I have the lineup just the way I want it, Director.

436
00:19:08,371 --> 00:19:10,105
尔等明白了吗
Is that understood?

437
00:19:12,942 --> 00:19:14,827
每一个人都在盯着
Everybody's looking

438
00:19:14,829 --> 00:19:17,112
一个没有军事背景的女性海军部长
at a female SECNAV with no military background,

439
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,964
疑心这两点
wondering if either one of those things

440
00:19:18,966 --> 00:19:20,549
会不会造成问题
are gonna be a factor.

441
00:19:20,551 --> 00:19:23,618
我希望能够妥善处理此事 让他们瞧瞧
I'd like to answer them by setting this right.

442
00:19:24,754 --> 00:19:28,757
因此 我需要得到所有的帮助
And to do that, I need all the help I can get.

443
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:30,959
尤其是你们的
Especially yours.

444
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,185
哦 天啊
Oh, God.

445
00:19:41,155 --> 00:19:44,239
愚蠢的笔 给我答案吧
Stupid pen, give me answers.

446
00:19:47,527 --> 00:19:49,578
你在那儿站了多久了
How long have you been standing there?

447
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,363
哦 几分钟罢了
Oh, just a few minutes.

448
00:19:51,365 --> 00:19:53,532
-我以为你知道的 -我不知道
- I thought you knew. - No.

449
00:19:53,534 --> 00:19:55,667
但是你跟我说话来着
But you were talking to me.

450
00:19:55,669 --> 00:20:01,590
不 我是在跟我自己 还有一支...笔说话
No, I-I was talking to myself and a... pen.

452
00:20:01,592 --> 00:20:03,842
但是现在起我不会再说了
But now I'm not talking anymore,

453
00:20:03,844 --> 00:20:05,660
谁知道有谁在偷听
cause who knows who's listening?

454
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:09,164
你觉得谁在偷听
Who do you think's listening?

455
00:20:17,357 --> 00:20:19,841
哦 不...不要相信你听说过的任何事情
Oh, no... don't believe everything you hear.

456
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:23,678
我们不会随便地监听对话和电话
I mean, we don't randomly listen to conversations and phone calls.

458
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:28,617
我是认真的
I'm serious.

459
00:20:28,619 --> 00:20:30,518
像你们一样 我们监听也需要法院指令
We need a court order just like you.

460
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,871
我们中确实有一些坏家伙
We've had a few bad apples,

461
00:20:32,873 --> 00:20:34,823
但我们是好人
but we're good people

462
00:20:34,825 --> 00:20:37,125
维护法律 作出改变
out to uphold the law and make a difference.

463
00:20:38,044 --> 00:20:40,379
所以你没有监听我的电话
So you haven't bugged my phone?

464
00:20:41,665 --> 00:20:44,716
听着 我可以证明 我来这里只是为了帮忙
Look, I can prove I'm here to help.

465
00:20:44,718 --> 00:20:49,086
关于那个冒牌FBI探员 根据特区法医的描述 我画了这个
I drew this using D.C. examiner's description of our bogus FBI agent,

466
00:20:49,088 --> 00:20:52,507
在NSA的数据库里搜索了一下 查到了一个叫Rudolph Stalin的人
fed it into the NSA database, and got a hit on a guy named Rudolph Stalin.

469
00:20:52,509 --> 00:20:53,675
Rudolph Stalin

470
00:20:53,677 --> 00:20:55,427
好的
Okay.

471
00:20:56,596 --> 00:20:58,680
Rudolph Stalin是一个美国公民
Rudolph Stalin is an American citizen

472
00:20:58,682 --> 00:21:01,700
他以前当过国际间谍
with a history of international espionage

473
00:21:01,702 --> 00:21:04,102
而且和俄国有很深的政治关系
and strong political ties to Russia.

474
00:21:04,104 --> 00:21:06,888
还留着非常不错的小胡子
【注：俄国人比较喜欢留小胡子】
And a very nice mustache.

475
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,857
我不知道这是否意在讽刺
I wonder if it's supposed to be ironic.

476
00:21:08,859 --> 00:21:10,409
我们监视他将近一年了
He's been on our radar for about a year.

477
00:21:10,411 --> 00:21:13,245
啊哈 而且他是一个美国公民
Aha, hmm, and he is an American citizen.

478
00:21:13,247 --> 00:21:16,114
这正是为什么我们需要法院指令
Which is exactly why we needed a court order.

479
00:21:16,116 --> 00:21:17,916
我记得我几个月前读过他的档案
I remember reading his file a few months ago

480
00:21:17,918 --> 00:21:22,037
那时我在喝一碗奶油蘑菇汤
over a bowl of cream of mushroom soup.

481
00:21:23,506 --> 00:21:25,674
我用食物来联想记忆
I-I food-associate.

482
00:21:25,676 --> 00:21:27,926
哦
Oh.

483
00:21:27,928 --> 00:21:30,963
我只是...只是很惊讶你会画画
I-I'm just... I'm still stuck on the fact that you can draw.

484
00:21:30,965 --> 00:21:34,433
我是说 虽然画得没有Kate好 但还是非常不错
I mean, this isn't Kate good, but it's good good.

485
00:21:34,435 --> 00:21:35,434
谁是Kate
Who's Kate?

486
00:21:35,436 --> 00:21:38,103
那要花几个小时
That-that would take a few hours

487
00:21:38,105 --> 00:21:40,722
和一整盒纸巾来讲述
and a whole box of tissues.

488
00:21:40,724 --> 00:21:43,225
好吧 我们应该先发布通缉令
Okay, well, then we should get this BOLO out first,

489
00:21:43,227 --> 00:21:45,777
而且我想查查NSA那边进展得如何了
and I wanted to check up on the NSA operation.

490
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:47,729
嗯
Mm-hmm.

491
00:21:47,731 --> 00:21:51,566
嘿 Gibbs 你知道Bishop会画画吗
Hey, Gibbs, did you know that Bishop can draw?

492
00:21:51,568 --> 00:21:52,684
是的 她还在这儿
Yeah, she's still here.

493
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:55,237
为什么
Why?

494
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:00,375
好的
Okay.

495
00:22:00,377 --> 00:22:02,627
Abby
Abby?

496
00:22:02,629 --> 00:22:04,612
怎么了 是不是有关汇款的事
What? Is it about the money-drop?

497
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:07,749
也许我们应该谈一谈Kate
Maybe we should have that talk about Kate.

498
00:22:11,287 --> 00:22:13,638
经理听到了枪声 报了警
Manager heard the shots, called the police.

499
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,257
没人看到开枪的人
Nobody saw the shooter.

500
00:22:15,259 --> 00:22:17,592
NSA汇了那笔勒索费
NSA deposited the extortion money,

501
00:22:17,594 --> 00:22:20,628
然后我们的间谍通过咖啡店的无线网络接收
and our spy accessed it using the coffee shop's Wi-Fi.

502
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,597
这可不是我会接收一千万美元的最佳地点
It's not the first place I'd come to collect $10 million.

503
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:24,466
Flynderling探员也这么想
Agent Flynderling thought the same thing.

504
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:27,302
所以他没来得及呼叫支援 就先进行跟踪
That's why he came to follow up before calling in a task force.

505
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:29,688
三次近距离枪杀 正中胸部
Three gunshot wounds to the chest at close range.

506
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:32,807
根据弹孔的火药残留和身体组织的损伤程度
Based on the stippling and tissue damage,

507
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:34,192
他没有还手的机会
he never had a chance.

508
00:22:34,194 --> 00:22:35,660
刚刚才从他的汽车里出来
Barely got out of his car.

509
00:22:35,662 --> 00:22:37,112
-伏击 -老大
- Ambushed. - Boss,

510
00:22:37,114 --> 00:22:39,247
他的口袋里有东西
he's got something in his pocket.

511
00:22:47,656 --> 00:22:49,791
嘿 老大 这不是她的...
Hey, boss, isn't this her...

512
00:22:54,847 --> 00:22:57,215
我的报告
My report.

513
00:23:01,687 --> 00:23:03,838
你是对的 Gibbs探员
You were right, Agent Gibbs.

514
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,608
这和那个无关 Bishop
It's not about that, Bishop.

515
00:23:22,171 --> 00:23:26,157
有人在海军部长的身上放置了监听器
Somebody plants a surveillance device on the Secretary of the Navy,

517
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:27,759
敲诈了美国政府
and extorts the U.S. Government.

518
00:23:27,761 --> 00:23:33,014
很可能和在特区验尸房里偷第二支监听笔的冒牌FBI探员是同一个人
Likely the same guy who posed as an FBI agent to steal a second spy pen from the D.C. morgue.

520
00:23:33,015 --> 00:23:34,315
Rudolph Stalin--
Rudolph Stalin--

521
00:23:34,317 --> 00:23:36,851
他因把美国情报出售给俄罗斯人而被通缉
he's an American wanted for selling U.S. intel to Russia.

523
00:23:36,853 --> 00:23:38,319
有着那样的名字和那样的小胡子
【注：Stalin这名字让人联想到苏联大元帅Joseph Stalin】
With a name and a mustache like that,

524
00:23:38,321 --> 00:23:39,770
我真是震惊啊
I... I'm shocked.

525
00:23:39,772 --> 00:23:41,155
但是当NSA试图
But when the NSA tried

526
00:23:41,157 --> 00:23:42,606
汇款给他并追踪那笔存款时
to pay him off and track the deposit...

527
00:23:42,608 --> 00:23:44,325
他杀了NSA的Flynderling探员
He murdered NSA Agent Flynderling

528
00:23:44,327 --> 00:23:45,993
而且拿着那笔钱逃之夭夭
and got away with the money.

529
00:23:45,995 --> 00:23:47,995
事实上 我刚查了下离岸账户 
Actually, I just checked the offshore account.

530
00:23:47,997 --> 00:23:49,663
那笔勒索费还在
The extortion money's still there.

531
00:23:49,665 --> 00:23:51,565
他没动那一千万美元
He left behind ten million bucks.

532
00:23:51,567 --> 00:23:53,667
-这没有道理 -可能是杀了人之后吓坏了
- doesn't make any sense. - Could've panicked after the shooting.

533
00:23:53,669 --> 00:23:55,503
也许这家伙没有我们想的那么专业
Maybe this guy's not as professional as we thought.

534
00:23:55,505 --> 00:23:59,173
或者 这从一开始就与勒索山姆大叔无关
【注：山姆大叔就是美国政府】
Or maybe it's not about Uncle Sam's money in the first place.

536
00:23:59,175 --> 00:24:03,911
通过诱杀一个联邦探员 Stalin还可以得到什么
What... what else does Stalin get by luring and killing a federal agent?

538
00:24:07,081 --> 00:24:09,016
证明 向另一个买家证明
Authentication. Proof to another buyer

539
00:24:09,018 --> 00:24:10,885
这个情报是真的
that his intel is genuine.

540
00:24:10,887 --> 00:24:12,523
有人愿意支付超过一千万美元
Somebody willing to pay more than ten mil.

541
00:24:12,524 --> 00:24:13,296
所以他利用了我们
So he used us?

542
00:24:13,321 --> 00:24:15,470
这家伙在下棋 而我竟然从来没发现
This guy was playing chess, and I never even saw it.

543
00:24:17,275 --> 00:24:19,760
我知道我要做什么
I know what I have to do.

544
00:24:22,113 --> 00:24:23,480
清零
Reset.

545
00:24:23,482 --> 00:24:26,066
我会重新来一遍
I'll start over.

546
00:24:26,068 --> 00:24:27,651
-Bishop. -这次我能够查出来的
- Bishop. - I'll get it this time.

547
00:24:27,653 --> 00:24:29,620
我只是需要一些时间来清理棋盘
I just need some time to clear the chessboard.

548
00:24:29,622 --> 00:24:31,605
Bishop
Bishop.

549
00:24:31,607 --> 00:24:32,790
休息一下
Take a break.

550
00:24:34,275 --> 00:24:35,609
去买瓶饮料
Go get a soda.

551
00:24:35,611 --> 00:24:39,112
没有时间 而且我没零钱
There's no time, and I have no cash.

552
00:24:44,636 --> 00:24:46,220
拿着
Take it.

553
00:24:49,926 --> 00:24:50,891
是的 Abbs
Yeah, Abbs?

554
00:24:50,893 --> 00:24:52,309
-你可以来我的实验室吗 -可以
- Can you come to my lab? - Yep.

555
00:24:56,381 --> 00:24:58,966
米开朗基罗 莎士比亚 达芬奇 海明威
Michelangelo, Shakespeare, da Vinci, Hemingway.

556
00:24:58,968 --> 00:25:01,268
今天 你可以把我的名字加入他们的行列了 Gibbs
Today, you can count me amongst their ranks, Gibbs.

557
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:03,320
-我每天都这么干的 Abbs -你查到了什么
- I do every day, Abbs. - What do you got?

558
00:25:03,322 --> 00:25:05,522
一个大师级的线索
A masterpiece.

559
00:25:05,524 --> 00:25:07,942
看起来像是一个日期和时间
Well, it looks like a date and time stamp.

560
00:25:07,944 --> 00:25:10,561
有的时候 最伟大的艺术作品往往最简单
Sometimes the greatest works of art are simple.

561
00:25:10,563 --> 00:25:12,980
-你搞定这支笔了 -没 我失败了
- You got into the pen? - No. I failed.

562
00:25:12,982 --> 00:25:15,315
内置的存储芯片加密得实在太好了
The internal memory chip was too well encrypted.

563
00:25:15,317 --> 00:25:16,333
那这是什么 Abbs
Then what is this, Abbs?

564
00:25:16,335 --> 00:25:21,755
这是通过无线传感器登陆这个芯片的最后日期和时间
That is the last day and time the chip was accessedby the Wi-Fi transmitter

566
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:25,509
啊 就是芯片的发送端
Ah. That the send-y part?

567
00:25:25,511 --> 00:25:27,011
是的
Yes.

568
00:25:27,013 --> 00:25:28,963
所以 我不能告诉你
So, I can't tell you

569
00:25:28,965 --> 00:25:30,848
我们的坏家伙从这支笔里下载了什么
what our bad guy downloaded from the pen,

570
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:32,833
但是 因为芯片的发送端
but, because of the send-y part,

571
00:25:32,835 --> 00:25:34,351
我可以告诉你他什么时候下载的
I can tell you when he did it.

572
00:25:34,353 --> 00:25:36,470
是的 昨天
Yeah. Yesterday.

573
00:25:36,472 --> 00:25:37,972
晚上7:23
7:23 p.m.

574
00:25:37,974 --> 00:25:39,974
假设那支笔那时仍在海军部长的口袋里
And assuming that SECNAV still had the pen in her pocket--

575
00:25:39,976 --> 00:25:42,610
我交叉检查了她的时间表
I cross-referenced her schedule.

576
00:25:42,612 --> 00:25:46,480
Stalin下载时 Porter正和她十几岁的女儿在一个餐厅吃饭
Porter was at a restaurant having dinner with her teenage daughter when Stalin was downloading.

578
00:25:46,482 --> 00:25:48,181
他需要有多近
How close would he have to be?

579
00:25:48,183 --> 00:25:51,035
非常近 这是一支很小的笔 很短的天线
Close. It's a small pen-- small antenna.

580
00:25:51,037 --> 00:25:54,154
所以我检查了餐厅附近街道的监控录像
So I pulled street surveillance footage from near the restaurant,

581
00:25:54,156 --> 00:25:56,156
然后发现Stalin坐在他的车里
and found Stalin sitting in his car,

582
00:25:56,158 --> 00:25:58,075
正犯着叛国罪
committing high treason.

583
00:25:58,077 --> 00:26:00,494
我猜到处都有耳目确实挺有帮助
I guess having eyes and ears everywhere can be helpful.

584
00:26:00,496 --> 00:26:02,212
但是不要告诉Bishop我说过这话
But don't tell Bishop I said that.

585
00:26:02,214 --> 00:26:03,864
车牌
License plate.

586
00:26:03,866 --> 00:26:06,166
已经加到通缉令里了 Gibbs
Already added to the BOLO, Gibbs.

587
00:26:06,168 --> 00:26:07,801
我们找到这家伙的几率
Our chances of finding this guy

588
00:26:07,803 --> 00:26:09,003
突然加速剧增了
just skyrocketed.

589
00:26:09,005 --> 00:26:10,888
Abbs 非常出色
Abbs, that's really great work.

590
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:28,489
节哀顺变
I'm sorry for your loss.

591
00:26:30,442 --> 00:26:34,161
被杀的那个探员 是你的朋友吗
The agent who was killed-- was he a friend of yours?

592
00:26:34,163 --> 00:26:37,164
更像是我的哥哥
More like an older brother.

593
00:26:47,542 --> 00:26:50,177
一切都还好吗
Everything okay?

594
00:26:50,179 --> 00:26:55,349
不能告诉家人我在做什么是很痛苦的
It's tough not being able to talk to my family about what I do.

596
00:26:56,918 --> 00:26:58,802
你应该看看 当我告诉我妈
You should've seen my mom when I told her

597
00:26:58,804 --> 00:27:00,688
我在俄克拉荷马州外工作时她的表情
I was taking a job outside of Oklahoma.

598
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:01,922
那你为什么说了
Why did you?

599
00:27:01,924 --> 00:27:05,476
嗯 那就是妈妈和爸爸之间的区别
Mm. That's the difference between Mom and Dad.

601
00:27:05,478 --> 00:27:09,029
他的第一条规矩就是 舒适使人安逸
His first rule is: comfort makes for complicity.

602
00:27:09,031 --> 00:27:12,766
意为只有不断挑战自己才能成长
Means the only way to grow is by challenging yourself.

603
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:15,319
的确 这有助于记住我们工作的原因
Well, it helps to remember why we do the job.

604
00:27:15,321 --> 00:27:18,238
让自己不断前进
Keeps us going.

605
00:27:20,709 --> 00:27:23,494
事实上 我该回NSA了
Actually, I should get back to NSA.

606
00:27:23,496 --> 00:27:25,946
嗯 你可没那么容易溜走
Mm. You're not getting off that easy.

607
00:27:25,948 --> 00:27:27,998
Gibbs也喜欢规矩 第45条
Gibbs likes rules, too. Number 45:

608
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,783
自己清理自己的烂摊子
always clean up your mess.

609
00:27:29,785 --> 00:27:31,952
-怎么清理 -这个嘛 首先
- How? - Well, for starters,

610
00:27:31,954 --> 00:27:34,254
Rudolph Stalin的通缉令有回应了
the BOLO came back on Rudolph Stalin.

611
00:27:34,256 --> 00:27:35,973
我们知道他在哪了
We know where he is.

612
00:27:37,125 --> 00:27:39,727
走吧 没时间浪费了
Come on. Time's a-wastin'.

613
00:27:53,241 --> 00:27:54,691
好的 谢谢
Okay, thanks.

614
00:27:54,693 --> 00:27:56,410
特区警署说Stalin的汽车
Metro PD says Stalin's car

615
00:27:56,412 --> 00:27:58,579
仍旧停在前面很远的地方
is still parked in a lot out front.

616
00:27:58,581 --> 00:27:59,947
他们不确定他在哪个放映厅
They're not sure which theater he's in,

617
00:27:59,949 --> 00:28:02,149
不过一共就两个厅 你们想要我去哪儿
but there are only two screens. Where do you want me?

618
00:28:02,151 --> 00:28:03,483
我在武器与外勤训练中成绩拔尖
I aced my weapons and field training.

619
00:28:03,485 --> 00:28:05,252
你有枪吗 Ado Annie 
【注：歌剧《俄克拉荷马人》里的一个人物】 
You got a gun, Ado Annie?

620
00:28:05,254 --> 00:28:07,755
我把它留在我的四轮马车上了  
I left it in my surrey with the fringe on top.

621
00:28:07,757 --> 00:28:10,007
别对我引用《俄克拉荷马人》
Don't quote <i>Oklahoma</i> to me.

622
00:28:11,459 --> 00:28:13,427
呆在车里
Stay in the car.

623
00:28:13,429 --> 00:28:14,595
没问题
You bet.

624
00:28:38,453 --> 00:28:39,653
他
Him.

625
00:28:39,655 --> 00:28:41,121
就是他
That's him!

626
00:28:43,291 --> 00:28:44,708
联邦探员
Federal agent!

627
00:28:49,048 --> 00:28:50,363
站住 站住 站住
Stop, stop, stop!

628
00:28:58,973 --> 00:29:01,141
Bishop 你为什么用车撞他
Bishop, why'd you hit him with the car?

629
00:29:01,143 --> 00:29:03,894
事实上 是他撞到车上的
Well... technically, he ran into the car.

630
00:29:03,896 --> 00:29:07,047
必须说 那是凭直觉的 直觉是好事 对吗
Got to say, that was a gut move. Gut's good, right?

631
00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:09,349
我们故意让这家伙跑出来的
We intentionally flushed the guy out.

632
00:29:09,351 --> 00:29:10,767
Gibbs一直都守在出口
Gibbs had the exit covered the whole time.

633
00:29:10,769 --> 00:29:11,985
什么
What?

634
00:29:12,854 --> 00:29:15,572
她在刚刚那一瞬间变成Palmer了 老大
She pulled a Palmer on this guy, boss.

635
00:29:18,393 --> 00:29:21,829
至少他会安静地和我们回去
At least he'll go quietly.

636
00:29:24,115 --> 00:29:26,500
除非有律师在 否则我什么都不会说
I'm not saying anything without a lawyer.

637
00:29:26,502 --> 00:29:28,452
你们用车撞了我
You hit me with a car.

638
00:29:28,454 --> 00:29:30,420
我以为他要逃跑
I thought he was getting away.

639
00:29:30,422 --> 00:29:33,907
我读了他的档案 他在高中时是个田径明星
I read in his file that he was a high school track star.

640
00:29:34,742 --> 00:29:37,410
我能够记得我读的几乎所有东西
I remember almost everything I read.

641
00:29:38,913 --> 00:29:42,466
其中包括很多审讯记录
Which includes more than a few interrogation transcripts.

642
00:29:42,468 --> 00:29:43,750
言外之意是
Meaning what?

643
00:29:43,752 --> 00:29:45,769
我有一个主意
I have an idea.

644
00:29:45,771 --> 00:29:48,105
等一下 这些
Hang on. These.

645
00:29:48,107 --> 00:29:49,189
什么
What?

646
00:29:49,191 --> 00:29:50,390
我需要借用这个
I need to borrow this.

647
00:29:50,392 --> 00:29:52,309
谢谢
Thank you.

648
00:29:52,311 --> 00:29:54,361
审讯最重要的原则就是
Now, a major principle of an interrogation

649
00:29:54,363 --> 00:29:56,363
让嫌疑人自己下结论 是吧
is to let the suspect draw their own conclusions, right?

650
00:29:56,365 --> 00:30:00,367
所以 只要我不说自己是他的律师
Which means, as long as I never <i>say</i> I'm his lawyer,

651
00:30:00,369 --> 00:30:03,370
他也不问的话...
as long as he never asks...

652
00:30:03,372 --> 00:30:04,872
站住
Stop.

653
00:30:08,793 --> 00:30:10,410
我能做到
I can keep up.

654
00:30:12,947 --> 00:30:16,216
在你撞到他之前 他看见你没有
Did that guy see you before you hit him?

655
00:30:16,218 --> 00:30:18,001
没有
Mm-mm.

656
00:30:20,939 --> 00:30:24,308
我们已经打电话给公共辩护处...
Look, we called the public defender...

657
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,559
嗨 你...
Hey. What...

658
00:30:25,561 --> 00:30:26,727
终于来了 你是我的...
Finally. Are you my...?

659
00:30:26,729 --> 00:30:28,478
不好意思我穿成这样
Sorry for the outfit.

660
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,180
今天本该我休假的 我是Ellie Bishop
Today was supposed to be my day off. Ellie Bishop.

661
00:30:30,182 --> 00:30:31,265
你问过他问题吗
Have you been asking him questions?

662
00:30:31,267 --> 00:30:32,799
从法律上讲 我们有权
Legally, we can ask

663
00:30:32,801 --> 00:30:34,134
想问多少就问多少
as many questions as we want.

664
00:30:34,136 --> 00:30:36,770
由犯罪嫌疑人决定要不要在无律师的情况下开口
Up to the suspect to talk without a lawyer.

665
00:30:36,772 --> 00:30:38,305
说的没错 你想开口吗
That's true.Do you want to talk?

666
00:30:38,307 --> 00:30:42,409
我们是不是应该先私下谈谈 或者...
Shouldn't we speak somewhere in private first? Or...

667
00:30:42,411 --> 00:30:43,977
由你决定 我已经看过了相关文件
It's up to you. I mean, I've read the file,

668
00:30:43,979 --> 00:30:45,529
他们这个谋杀案的确证据确凿
and they do have a pretty solid murder case.

669
00:30:45,531 --> 00:30:48,198
-谋杀 -没错 一个联邦探员被杀
- Murder? - Yeah. Of a federal agent.

670
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,167
不可能 我 我没杀过人
No way. I-I didn't kill anybody.

671
00:30:50,169 --> 00:30:52,252
他们发现了海军部长钢笔上的蹊跷
They know about the pen on the Secretary of the Navy.

672
00:30:52,254 --> 00:30:54,171
他们查出你当时在餐馆
They know that you were at the restaurant,

673
00:30:54,173 --> 00:30:55,622
也知道了一千万美元的事
and they know about the $10 million.

674
00:30:55,624 --> 00:30:57,157
你可以坦白从宽的
You can help yourself, though.

675
00:30:57,159 --> 00:30:58,425
如果你认罪的话
If you cop to the murder,

676
00:30:58,427 --> 00:31:00,794
-也许可以减刑 -我没杀人
- might reduce sentencing. - I didn't kill anybody!

677
00:31:00,796 --> 00:31:02,796
你朝一个联邦探员的胸口连射三枪
You shot a federal agent three times in the chest!

678
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:04,264
喂 别太激动
Hey! Take it down a peg.

679
00:31:04,266 --> 00:31:06,099
他说他没杀人 好吗
He said he didn't kill anybody, okay?

680
00:31:06,101 --> 00:31:08,268
-我们先听他把话说完 -那你让他快说
- Let's hear him out. - Then you make it fast.

681
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:10,520
我没有勒索政府
I did not extort the government,

682
00:31:10,522 --> 00:31:13,056
我也没有杀这个探员
and I did not kill this agent.

683
00:31:13,058 --> 00:31:14,891
但我知道是谁做的
But I know who did.

684
00:31:14,893 --> 00:31:17,311
-名字 -Edward Gracy
- Name. - Edward Gracy.

685
00:31:17,313 --> 00:31:18,695
他之前卖过情报给我
He's sold me info before.

686
00:31:18,697 --> 00:31:20,364
一些技术机密之类的公司项目
Corporate stuff at tech secrets.

687
00:31:20,366 --> 00:31:22,849
这是他第一次提供政府情报
This is the first time he's offered government intel.

688
00:31:22,851 --> 00:31:24,117
所以你承认了叛国
So you're admitting to treason.

689
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:25,569
我们该信他的话吗
We supposed to believe this?

690
00:31:25,571 --> 00:31:27,955
我不知道要不要相信他
I don't know if I believe him at all.

691
00:31:27,957 --> 00:31:30,123
需要他的地址来证明你说的话
Need an address to prove it.

692
00:31:40,585 --> 00:31:42,386
写吧
Here you go.

693
00:31:54,065 --> 00:31:55,047
我的控辩协议怎么办
Hey, what about my deal?

694
00:31:55,072 --> 00:31:56,734
这事你得跟你的律师商量
Oh, you'll have to take that up with your lawyer.

695
00:31:56,735 --> 00:31:57,985
你说过你是我的律师
You said you were my lawyer.

696
00:31:57,987 --> 00:32:00,220
不 我没说过 我给了你名片
No, I didn't. Gave you my card.

697
00:32:10,282 --> 00:32:11,999
这在法庭上能站得住脚吗
Is that gonna hold up in court?

698
00:32:12,001 --> 00:32:14,034
我不知道 我也不是律师
I don't know.I'm not a lawyer, either.

699
00:32:14,036 --> 00:32:17,537
好了 确认是城内一处办公室
All right, got confirmation on a downtown office,

700
00:32:17,539 --> 00:32:20,207
承租者名为Edward Gracy
rent in the name Edward Gracy.

701
00:32:20,209 --> 00:32:22,042
我已经通知了特区警署 他们严阵以待
I alerted Metro PD, and they're on standby.

702
00:32:22,044 --> 00:32:23,427
我正在适应这里的节奏
Getting used to your pace here.

703
00:32:23,429 --> 00:32:24,594
那你会需要这个的
Well, then you're gonna need this.

704
00:32:27,048 --> 00:32:30,767
呃...这东西之前有人穿过吗
Uh... h-has this been used?

705
00:32:33,422 --> 00:32:35,255
我是Bishop
Bishop.

706
00:32:36,974 --> 00:32:38,108

00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,643
当然
Of course.

708
00:32:40,528 --> 00:32:41,761
是...是的
Y... Yes.

709
00:32:41,763 --> 00:32:43,096
是的 马上
Yes, right away.

710
00:32:43,098 --> 00:32:44,648
出什么事了 特区警署出状况了
What's the matter? There a problem with Metro?

711
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:46,400
不是 是我在NSA的上司
No. Uh, it was my boss at NSA.

712
00:32:46,402 --> 00:32:49,236
他们要我立刻回总部汇报
They need me back at HQ to debrief immediately.

713
00:32:49,238 --> 00:32:50,704
要出发了
Got to go.

714
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,624
联邦探员
Federal agents!

715
00:33:30,911 --> 00:33:33,380
Edward Gracy
Edward Gracy!

716
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:36,264
没人在
Nobody's home.

717
00:33:36,265 --> 00:33:38,366
你怎么想 我们又被耍了么
What do you think? We being played again?

718
00:33:39,368 --> 00:33:41,618
检查一下桌子
Check the desk.

719
00:33:46,875 --> 00:33:49,126
没什么有用的 只有些垃圾邮件 
Nothing here but junk mail,

720
00:33:49,128 --> 00:33:51,245
GSM的过期杂志
back issues of <i>GSM.</i>

721
00:33:51,247 --> 00:33:54,381
都是寄到这儿给Edward Gracy的
They're all addressed here to Edward Gracy.

722
00:33:54,383 --> 00:33:56,584
噢
Oh.

723
00:33:59,054 --> 00:34:01,305
这就是我们的幕后弈者
This is our master chess player?

724
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:08,312
老大 我查到点东西
Boss, I got something back here.

725
00:34:08,314 --> 00:34:11,765
这绝对是Gracy制造窃听器的地方
Well, this is definitely where Gracy makes his bugs,

726
00:34:11,767 --> 00:34:15,653
而且显然还提高对心脏疾病的关注率
and apparently raises awareness about heart disease, as well.

727
00:34:15,655 --> 00:34:16,770
慈善机构信函
Charity mailers?

728
00:34:16,772 --> 00:34:18,572
-难道凶手很有善心 -不
- Our killer has a conscience? - Nope.

729
00:34:18,574 --> 00:34:20,074
是他的目标有善心
His targets do.

730
00:34:20,076 --> 00:34:23,410
寄给海军部长Sarah Porter的邮递收据
Shipping receipt for a mailer sent to Sarah Porter.

731
00:34:23,412 --> 00:34:24,645
他把窃听器
SECNAV. He's sending the bugs

732
00:34:24,647 --> 00:34:25,863
和宣传单一起寄出
with the brochures.

733
00:34:25,865 --> 00:34:27,481
垃圾邮件 免费赠品
Junk mail free gifts.

734
00:34:27,483 --> 00:34:28,649
并非回邮地址标签
Instead of return-address labels,

735
00:34:28,651 --> 00:34:30,417
你得到一支超级间谍笔
you get a super spy pen?

736
00:34:30,419 --> 00:34:31,919
这可是很大风险 甚至无法保证
It's a big risk with no guarantee

737
00:34:31,921 --> 00:34:33,987
这支笔能够通过你的"废品匣" 更不用说进入MTAC了
it's gonna make it past your junk drawer, let alone MTAC.

738
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:35,372
这儿全都是收据
This is full of receipts.

739
00:34:35,374 --> 00:34:36,841
他定时发送这些邮件
He sends them out like clockwork.

740
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,847
都来自于相同的邮局
These are all from the same post office.

741
00:35:40,222 --> 00:35:41,572
喂
Hello.

742
00:35:41,574 --> 00:35:43,941
你在这儿做什么
What the hell are you doing here?

743
00:35:43,943 --> 00:35:46,243
呃...
Uh...

744
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:55,502
我可以解释
Okay, I can explain.

745
00:35:55,504 --> 00:35:58,122
我深入调查Edward Gracy这个名字
I kept digging into the name Edward Gracy.

746
00:35:58,124 --> 00:35:59,873
我只是...我控制不住自己
I just...I couldn't help myself.

747
00:35:59,875 --> 00:36:01,709
回你的车上去
Get back in your car.

748
00:36:01,711 --> 00:36:03,961
好的 但等一下 Gracy这个名字是化名
Okay, but wait. Th-The name Gracy is an alias,

749
00:36:03,963 --> 00:36:06,463
我查到了一张仍在使用的信用卡 每周都有固定的消费
and I found an open credit card with weekly purchases...

750
00:36:06,465 --> 00:36:08,799
-Bishop -就是在这个邮局
- Bishop! - ...a-at this post office, okay?

751
00:36:08,801 --> 00:36:10,083
我是来这里
I-I came here

752
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:11,185
追查线索的
to follow up.

753
00:36:11,187 --> 00:36:13,020
Gracy的邮箱就在这里面
Gracy's P.O. box is inside the store.

754
00:36:13,022 --> 00:36:14,855
我知道 他也在里面
I know! So is he.

755
00:36:14,857 --> 00:36:16,390
这是我一直想告诉你的
It's what I'm trying to tell you.

756
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,860
噢
Oh.

757
00:36:19,862 --> 00:36:22,429
你在监视他
You're on a stakeout.

758
00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:26,450
-老大 -Bishop
- Boss? - Bishop!

759
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:31,104
快开车
Go!

760
00:36:49,758 --> 00:36:51,792
你在书里读到怎么让坏人缴械投降的吗
What, did you read a book on disarming bad guys?

761
00:36:51,794 --> 00:36:54,127
我有三个哥哥 别挣扎了
Three older brothers. Quit squirming!

762
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:55,429
我想我们会发现这把枪
I think we'll find this weapon's

763
00:36:55,431 --> 00:36:57,431
和谋杀Flynn的武器相符
a match to the one that killed Flynn.

764
00:36:58,817 --> 00:37:01,068
我来接手吧
I'll take it from here.

765
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:02,186
-可以了么 -是的
- You got it? - Yeah.

766
00:37:02,188 --> 00:37:03,187
好的
All right.

767
00:37:03,189 --> 00:37:05,639
我们走吧 大块头
Here we go, big guy.

768
00:37:17,035 --> 00:37:18,752
怎么了
What?

769
00:37:20,422 --> 00:37:22,423
我们都是对的
We were both right.

770
00:37:22,425 --> 00:37:24,508
我们抓到了他
And we got him.

771
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:27,511
你还是没看到重点 Bishop
You're still missing the point, Bishop.

772
00:37:36,471 --> 00:37:39,056
指纹显示这个人
Got a hit on the fingerprint.

773
00:37:39,058 --> 00:37:41,476
真名是Thaddeus Knox
Real name is Thaddeus Knox.

774
00:37:41,477 --> 00:37:43,677
因从事商业间谍活动受到多项指控
Multiple arrests for corporate espionage.

775
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:45,479
现在又加上叛国罪和谋杀罪
Now we can add treason and murder.

776
00:37:45,481 --> 00:37:48,065
-这说不通啊 -又怎么了 Russell Crowe
【注：好莱坞男星 主演过角斗士】
- It doesn't make any sense. - What now, Russell Crowe?

777
00:37:48,067 --> 00:37:49,233
你的美丽心灵
【注：2001年出品的电影 讲述数学家John Nash的一生】
Hasn't your beautiful mind

778
00:37:49,235 --> 00:37:50,735
今天还没让你吃够苦头
gotten you in enough trouble today?

779
00:37:50,737 --> 00:37:52,954
找到答案前我是不会退出的
Look, I don't quit until I get it right, and our corporate

780
00:37:52,956 --> 00:37:54,822
我们这位开公司的花样美男并不符合测写
pretty boy just doesn't fit into the big picture.

781
00:37:54,824 --> 00:37:57,358
无论是NSA还是NCIS都没有见过他
We've never seen him--NSA or NCIS.

782
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,026
-他是个新手 -没错
- He's a first-timer. - Exactly.

783
00:37:59,028 --> 00:38:00,878
如果他一向把窃听器
But if he sends bugs to tech employees

784
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,382
寄给科技公司的雇员来窃取商业秘密的话 为什么突然把目标转向海军部长
looking for corporate secrets,why make the jump to SECNAV

785
00:38:04,384 --> 00:38:07,385
还冒着终身监禁的风险去杀人
and a crime that carries out a life sentence?

786
00:38:07,387 --> 00:38:08,869
有些事逼他离开了舒适圈
Something made him leave his comfort zone.

787
00:38:08,871 --> 00:38:11,705
这跟意识形态和权力无关 是...
It's not about ideology or power, it's...

788
00:38:11,707 --> 00:38:13,641
是自我挑战
it's about challenging himself,

789
00:38:13,643 --> 00:38:15,542
证明他能胜任这项工作
proving that he can do the job.

790
00:38:15,544 --> 00:38:16,594
他是为了讨谁的欢心呢
Who's he trying to impress?

791
00:38:16,596 --> 00:38:18,813
他的老板
His boss.

792
00:38:35,614 --> 00:38:36,774
对了 对了 对了 对了
Yup, yup, yup, yup.

793
00:38:40,502 --> 00:38:42,569
别告诉我 你能从这些杂乱无章的邮件中找到线索
Don't tell me those crazy papers are finally paying off.

794
00:38:44,573 --> 00:38:46,740
-Bishop -我有个
- Bishop... - I have staff lists

795
00:38:46,742 --> 00:38:48,759
今早在MTAC里的公司的人员名单
from the corporations in MTAC this morning.

796
00:38:48,761 --> 00:38:51,912
窃听器寄给了几乎所有公司的雇员 除了一家
Bugs have been sent to employees of every company except one.

797
00:38:51,914 --> 00:38:54,098
-就是给Gracy付钱的那个公司 -Beringer Marine
- The same company that's paying Gracy. - Beringer Marine.

798
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,582
他们和海军部长有过节吗
What do they have against SECNAV?

799
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:04,308
Gibbs探员
Agent Gibbs.

800
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:06,593
你也是来听进展汇报的
You here for the update?

801
00:39:11,733 --> 00:39:13,651
怎么了
What's going on?

802
00:39:13,653 --> 00:39:14,986
我怎么知道
Hell if I know.

803
00:39:14,988 --> 00:39:17,071
部长女士让我停止工作
Madam Secretary's cut me out of the loop.

804
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:20,441
是啊 就连我也注意到了
Yeah. I couldn't help but notice

805
00:39:20,443 --> 00:39:22,493
你们俩之间的紧张气氛
the tension between you two earlier.

806
00:39:22,495 --> 00:39:25,129
你知道 我不在乎接受命令
You know, I don't mind taking orders.

807
00:39:25,131 --> 00:39:29,616
但我更情愿它们来自海军陆战队成员
I'd prefer they come from fellow Marines,

808
00:39:29,618 --> 00:39:30,968
或者是服过兵役的人
or someone who's served.

809
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:32,336
我明白
I hear you.

810
00:39:32,338 --> 00:39:34,505
一个平民发布影响数千名军官的命令
A civilian giving orders that affects thousands

811
00:39:34,507 --> 00:39:37,791
真是让我难以接受
of military personnel pisses me off more than you know.

812
00:39:37,793 --> 00:39:39,510
几个月前
Few months back,

813
00:39:39,512 --> 00:39:42,063
我还在海军部长候选人名单上
I was on the short list for the SECNAV appointment.

814
00:39:44,232 --> 00:39:46,684
我很荣幸 但我不觉得这是正确的
I was honored, but didn't feel right about it.

815
00:39:46,686 --> 00:39:48,602
为什么
Why?

816
00:39:48,604 --> 00:39:50,821
-你看起来资历不错 -也许吧
- You seem qualified. - Maybe.

817
00:39:50,823 --> 00:39:53,324
但我从没穿过制服
But I haven't served in uniform.

818
00:39:53,326 --> 00:39:55,526
而我对服过兵役的人充满敬意
And I have too much respect for those who have.

819
00:39:55,528 --> 00:39:56,810
比如你
Like you.

820
00:39:56,812 --> 00:39:58,195
Porter假装自己知道
It's not right

821
00:39:58,197 --> 00:40:00,481
这些军人到底需要什么 这很不对
for Porter to pretend she knows what they need.

822
00:40:00,483 --> 00:40:01,999
她本该做出正确选择 就像我一样
She should've done the right thing, like I did,

823
00:40:02,001 --> 00:40:03,334
拒绝这个任命
and declined the position.

824
00:40:03,336 --> 00:40:05,419
但是...
But...

825
00:40:05,421 --> 00:40:07,204
我猜她现在不得不退位了
I guess she'll have to now.

826
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:13,594
这是什么
What is this?

827
00:40:13,596 --> 00:40:15,546
NSA的窃听器
A bug at the NSA.

828
00:40:15,548 --> 00:40:16,681
谁能想到呢
Who would've thought?

829
00:40:16,683 --> 00:40:18,683
你背叛了我 陆战队员
You turn on me, Marine?

830
00:40:18,685 --> 00:40:20,685
唯一的背叛者是你 Ward
The only turncoat here is you, Ward.

831
00:40:20,687 --> 00:40:22,553
雇佣了一个商业间谍
By hiring one of your corporate spies

832
00:40:22,555 --> 00:40:25,139
来为难我 你置整个国家的安危于不顾
to embarrass me, you put the entire country at risk.

833
00:40:25,141 --> 00:40:26,941
我没做那种事
I had nothing to do with that.

834
00:40:26,943 --> 00:40:28,359
我只想保护这个国家
I only want to protect this country

835
00:40:28,361 --> 00:40:29,843
和为国效力的人民
and the people defending it.

836
00:40:31,063 --> 00:40:33,781
也许我没有服过役 但我明白
I may not have served,but I know about duty

837
00:40:33,783 --> 00:40:35,282
什么是职责和牺牲
and sacrifice.

838
00:40:36,451 --> 00:40:40,404
军装可不足以造就整只团队
Takes more than a uniform to make a team.

839
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:53,417
Gibbs探员
Agent Gibbs?

840
00:40:53,419 --> 00:40:56,220
Tony和McGee说你还在这里
Tony and McGee said you'd still be here.

841
00:40:56,222 --> 00:40:58,055
是的
I am.

842
00:40:58,057 --> 00:41:01,592
抱歉 这么晚还打扰你
Sorry to...bother you so late.

843
00:41:01,594 --> 00:41:03,677
永远不要说抱歉
Never say you're sorry.

844
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:05,846
这是脆弱的表现
It is a sign of weakness.

845
00:41:05,848 --> 00:41:09,483
我认为这是关键问题
I thought that was the point.

846
00:41:09,485 --> 00:41:12,770
尤其是今天过后
Especially after today.

847
00:41:12,772 --> 00:41:15,740
但我觉得我终于想通了一些东西
But I think I've finally figured something out.

848
00:41:15,742 --> 00:41:18,192
你总是得找到正确答案 是吧 Bishop
You always got to have the right answer, don't you, Bishop?

849
00:41:19,562 --> 00:41:22,246
很不幸 的确是的
Unfortunately.

850
00:41:22,248 --> 00:41:25,399
但如果你让我说完 我能解释这为什么是错的
But if you'll let me finish, I can explain why that's wrong.

851
00:41:31,706 --> 00:41:34,458
我努力工作
I work hard.

852
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:38,045
当我跌倒时 我能立刻爬起来
And when I fall,I get right back up.

853
00:41:38,047 --> 00:41:41,081
我很聪明 而且我想做出改变
I'm smart, a-and I want to make a difference.

854
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:46,053
我可以做到
And I can.

855
00:41:46,055 --> 00:41:50,474
我一直只顾着眼于整体的棋局
Been so busy looking at the...the chessboard on my own,

856
00:41:50,476 --> 00:41:53,811
却忘了我也是其中的一份子
I... I forgot to be a part of it.

857
00:41:55,697 --> 00:41:57,815
我没有表现出团队意识
I wasn't a team player.

858
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:00,768
所以...
So...

859
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:03,454
这就是我想说的
that-that's... that's what I wanted to say.

860
00:42:03,456 --> 00:42:04,738
就这些
That's it.

861
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:06,240
晚安
Um, good night.

862
00:42:06,242 --> 00:42:07,992
好运
Or good... good luck.

863
00:42:07,994 --> 00:42:10,494
算了
Never mind.

864
00:42:10,496 --> 00:42:12,546
你忘了点儿东西
You forgot something.

865
00:42:17,919 --> 00:42:19,453
那不是我的
Uh, that's not mine.

866
00:42:19,455 --> 00:42:20,771
你的名字在上面
It's got your name on it.

867
00:42:31,233 --> 00:42:34,401
这是很多年前 我去NSA工作之前
This is my NCIS application from years ago.

868
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:38,439
向NCIS提交的工作申请
Before I took the job at NSA.

869
00:42:38,441 --> 00:42:39,990
你怎么知道的
How did you know about this?

870
00:42:39,992 --> 00:42:42,409
你的名字有点熟悉 我回去查了查
Your name sounded familiar;I went back and looked it up.

871
00:42:42,411 --> 00:42:44,411
这就是你今天带上我的原因
That's why you brought me along today.

872
00:42:45,864 --> 00:42:47,147
你也在下一盘棋
You play chess, too.

873
00:42:49,034 --> 00:42:52,253
我想看看你是否还有能力应对挑战
I wanted to see if you were still up for a challenge.

874
00:42:52,255 --> 00:42:54,171
为什么
Why?

875
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:58,876
我希望你留下
I'd like to keep you around.

876
00:42:58,878 --> 00:43:00,794
联合工作分配
Joint duty assignment.

877
00:43:01,596 --> 00:43:03,631
什么
What?

878
00:43:14,876 --> 00:43:19,876
