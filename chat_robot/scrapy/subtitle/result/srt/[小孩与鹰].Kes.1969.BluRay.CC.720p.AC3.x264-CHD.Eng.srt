1
00:00:57,582 --> 00:00:59,626
Jud?

2
00:00:59,709 --> 00:01:02,045
What?

3
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:04,464
Yer'd better get up.

4
00:01:12,555 --> 00:01:14,807
The alarm's gone off, yer know.

5
00:01:14,891 --> 00:01:17,393
Do you think I don't know?

6
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:22,482
- Jud?
- What?

7
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:25,985
- You'll be late.
- Shut it.

8
00:01:27,278 --> 00:01:30,323
- Clock's not fast, yer know.
- I said, shut it.

9
00:01:30,406 --> 00:01:33,243
- Give over. That hurts!
- Well, shut it, then.

10
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:35,536
I'll tell me mam on you.

11
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,122
Shut yer stinkin' mouth.

12
00:01:44,837 --> 00:01:47,131
Oh, Christ!

13
00:01:49,884 --> 00:01:52,971
- Set clock on for me, Jud. For seven.
- Set it yerself.

14
00:01:53,054 --> 00:01:55,139
Go on, you're up.

15
00:01:57,725 --> 00:02:00,228
Hands off cocks; on socks.

16
00:02:03,273 --> 00:02:06,276
You rotten sod!
Just because you've to get up!

17
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:09,696
- Another few weeks, you'll be up with me.
- I'll not.

18
00:02:09,779 --> 00:02:13,283
- Won't yer?
- No, cos I'm not gonna work down the pit.

19
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:16,578
- Where are yer gonna work?
- I don't know, but not down the pit.

20
00:02:16,661 --> 00:02:18,746
No. And have I to tell yer why?

21
00:02:19,247 --> 00:02:23,042
For one thing, you've to be able
to read and write before they set yer on.

22
00:02:23,126 --> 00:02:25,962
And they wouldn't have
a weedy little twat like thee.

23
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:29,674
- Switch t'light out, then.
- Switch it out yerself.

24
00:03:58,137 --> 00:04:00,431
Me billicking bike!

25
00:05:38,446 --> 00:05:41,324
- I thought you weren't coming.
- Why? I'm not late, am I?

26
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:43,743
Very near.

27
00:05:43,826 --> 00:05:47,372
- I nearly was, though.
- What do yer mean?

28
00:05:47,455 --> 00:05:49,624
Our Jud, he's taken t'bike.

29
00:05:49,707 --> 00:05:51,793
- What you gonna do, then?
- Walk it.

30
00:05:51,876 --> 00:05:55,505
- How long d'yer think that's gonna take?
- It'll not take me long.

31
00:05:55,588 --> 00:06:00,301
There's a waiting list a mile long
for that job. Good lads, too, most of 'em.

32
00:06:00,385 --> 00:06:04,430
- From up Firs Hill, round there.
- I haven't let you down, have I?

33
00:06:05,014 --> 00:06:07,267
- Mornin'.
- Mornin'. Not very promisin'.

34
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:10,228
- A bit on the nippy side as well, I think.
- Aye.

35
00:06:10,311 --> 00:06:13,064
- 20 Players tipped, please.
- Oh, right.

36
00:06:13,147 --> 00:06:17,485
- I've not got 20. Will two tens do?
- Yes. That'll be quite all right, thank you.

37
00:06:18,486 --> 00:06:21,114
Thank you. Right. Cheerio.

38
00:06:21,197 --> 00:06:23,575
- Cheerio. Good mornin', sir.
- Good mornin'.

39
00:06:23,658 --> 00:06:25,910
You know what they said
when I took you on?

40
00:06:25,994 --> 00:06:31,332
"You'll have to keep yer eyes open now.
He'll take yer breath if you're not careful. "

41
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:36,087
- I haven't taken owt of yours yet, have I?
- I haven't given you a chance, that's why.

42
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:39,215
You don't have to.
I haven't been nicking for ages now.

43
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:42,427
- Ah, well, don't stand about all day.
- I'm goin'.

44
00:07:58,253 --> 00:08:00,546
- How tha goin' on?
- Not so bad.

45
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,799
Get one of these. Better than walkin'.

46
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:05,551
Only just. I could go
faster on a kid's scooter.

47
00:08:05,635 --> 00:08:10,431
Tha knows what I always say; third-class
ridin's better than first-class walkin'.

48
00:08:10,515 --> 00:08:12,809
Third-class ridin'? In that ramshack?

49
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:17,563
Ramshack? This is one of best models
t'dairy's got. Cheeky! Sithee tomorrow.

50
00:08:17,647 --> 00:08:22,068
- Can only go 20 mile an hour, as it is.
- Tha's got too much rattle, thee.

51
00:08:56,352 --> 00:09:00,106
"Desperate Dan is stronger than all,
but this opponent makes him fall. "

52
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,484
"- Right! Where do you want to fight?
- Right here!"

53
00:09:03,568 --> 00:09:04,319
"SKID."

54
00:09:04,402 --> 00:09:06,946
"Down I go again!
What's making me fall?"

55
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:09,532
"Now's my chance to -
jump on his chest!"

56
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:10,533
"THUD."

57
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:12,827
"You won't catch me out this time,
you braggart!"

58
00:09:12,911 --> 00:09:15,163
"A sock in the midriff
will settle your game!"

59
00:09:15,246 --> 00:09:16,331
"SPLASH."

60
00:09:16,414 --> 00:09:18,791
"What's this on my face?
Why, it's grease!"

61
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:22,170
"- Give me that tube back!
- That's how he kept making me slip!"

62
00:09:22,253 --> 00:09:25,006
"He was squirting
invisible grease under my feet!"

63
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:28,134
"You dirty twister!
It's time somebody taught you a lesson!"

64
00:09:28,217 --> 00:09:30,678
"- Take that!
- CRASH!"

65
00:09:30,762 --> 00:09:34,098
"- Where did he end up?
- In the middle of next week, Uncle Dan!"

66
00:09:51,866 --> 00:09:54,577
- Evenin'.
- I told yer it wouldn't take me long.

67
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:57,038
What did you do?
Throw 'em over the gates?

68
00:09:57,121 --> 00:10:02,585
- I know some short cuts ont' way back.
- I'll bet you do! Over other folk's property.

69
00:10:04,545 --> 00:10:08,174
How many times d'yer want
tellin' where to put that bag?

70
00:10:12,387 --> 00:10:14,847
- Time is it?
- Time you were at school.

71
00:10:14,931 --> 00:10:16,224
Is it that late?

72
00:10:16,307 --> 00:10:19,936
I wouldn't be your teacher
for all the coal in Barnsley.

73
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,316
Oh, Mr Porter! Watch it, Mr Porter.

74
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,778
Yer clumsy young bugger!
What yer tryin' to do? Kill me?

75
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:30,947
I lost me balance.

76
00:10:32,657 --> 00:10:36,077
I wouldn't put it past yer, either.
I fair felt me heart go then.

77
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,289
Just sit down here and
relax a couple o' minutes.

78
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,250
Are yer all right now?

79
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:45,461
- I'm bloody champion!
- I'll be off, then.

80
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,673
And don't be late tonight.

81
00:10:51,926 --> 00:10:53,303
- Allot?
- Sir.

82
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:54,846
- Bowser?
- Sir.

83
00:10:54,929 --> 00:10:56,431
Bridges?

84
00:10:56,514 --> 00:10:59,684
- Absent, sir.
- Absent, Bridges. Casper?

85
00:10:59,767 --> 00:11:01,311
- Sir.
- Clegg?

86
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:03,104
- Sir.
- Fisher?

87
00:11:03,187 --> 00:11:05,481
German Bight.

88
00:11:08,318 --> 00:11:10,820
- Did you say something?
- I didn't mean to, sir.

89
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:14,198
Stand up, lad. What did you say?

90
00:11:14,282 --> 00:11:18,077
- German Bight, sir.
- He's daft, sir.

91
00:11:18,161 --> 00:11:21,039
- Is this your ridiculous idea of a joke?
- No, sir.

92
00:11:21,122 --> 00:11:24,542
- What is the idea, then?
- When you said "Fisher", sir.

93
00:11:24,626 --> 00:11:27,170
- What about it?
- Fisher. German Bight.

94
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:31,215
It's the shipping forecast, sir.
Fisher. German Bight. Cromarty.

95
00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:34,260
I like to hear it every night, sir.
I like t'names.

96
00:11:34,344 --> 00:11:39,265
So you thought you'd enlighten me and
the class with your idiotic information?

97
00:11:39,349 --> 00:11:42,185
- No, sir.
- Making a mess of my register.

98
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:44,938
- It just came out.
- And so did you, Casper.

99
00:11:45,021 --> 00:11:47,607
Just come out from under a stone.

100
00:11:52,528 --> 00:11:54,781
I said, quiet!

101
00:11:54,864 --> 00:11:58,284
Is anyone else absent
besides Bridges and Fisher?

102
00:11:58,368 --> 00:12:00,912
Any girls?

103
00:12:00,995 --> 00:12:04,165
Right. Now, then,
it's time you were off to assembly.

104
00:12:04,249 --> 00:12:06,918
One row at a time. This one, stand.

105
00:12:09,212 --> 00:12:11,506
Move forward.

106
00:12:15,426 --> 00:12:18,012
Pamela, you're talking. Cut it out.

107
00:12:21,266 --> 00:12:26,688
- Billy, what do yer mean, Germans bite?
- I'm sick of hearin' about "Germans bite"!

108
00:12:26,771 --> 00:12:29,148
- Are yer comin' nestin' tomorrow?
- Ar.

109
00:12:29,232 --> 00:12:31,192
- What time?
- About six.

110
00:12:31,276 --> 00:12:33,111
Don't be late.

111
00:12:33,194 --> 00:12:34,821
- Coming, Guth?
- Where?

112
00:12:34,904 --> 00:12:36,906
- Nestin'.
- When?

113
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,408
- Tomorrow.
- What time?

114
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:42,412
- About six.
- Can't. Takin't'girlfriend to Sheffield.

115
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,163
Excuses!

116
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,892
What do you want
at this time in the morning?

117
00:13:04,976 --> 00:13:06,311
Get your Mac up.

118
00:13:06,394 --> 00:13:09,731
Hey, he's fast asleep.
I can't get him up at this time.

119
00:13:09,814 --> 00:13:12,817
- Just get him up for me.
- His father, he'll be down to yer.

120
00:13:12,901 --> 00:13:16,529
I'm not bothered about his father.
I want your MacDowall.

121
00:13:24,245 --> 00:13:26,998
- Bugger off, you little sod!
- Get him up, will yer?

122
00:13:27,081 --> 00:13:30,251
- I'm not gettin' him up.
- He said I had to get him up.

123
00:13:30,335 --> 00:13:33,963
He's fast asleep and he's not goin',
so just get off with yer.

124
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:17,896
- Now, then. What's tha doin'?
- Nowt.

125
00:17:17,979 --> 00:17:20,356
Bugger off, then. It's private property.

126
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,443
- Can I get up to that kestrel's nest?
- What kestrel's nest?

127
00:17:23,526 --> 00:17:26,321
- Up wall.
- No nest up there, so off tha goes.

128
00:17:26,404 --> 00:17:28,907
There is. I've seen 'em come out.

129
00:17:32,327 --> 00:17:34,787
What will tha do? Take all its eggs?

130
00:17:34,871 --> 00:17:38,166
- They're young 'uns.
- Nowt to go up for, then, is there?

131
00:17:38,249 --> 00:17:42,003
Can I come to t'bottom, then?
Never seen a kestrel's nest before.

132
00:17:42,086 --> 00:17:44,172
Come on, then.

133
00:17:51,012 --> 00:17:53,222
There it is. That big hole.

134
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:56,726
- It's nested there for donkey's years now.
- And I never knew.

135
00:17:56,809 --> 00:18:01,231
- No, there's not many that does.
- Been watchin' from t'wood there.

136
00:18:01,314 --> 00:18:03,983
Goes onto t'post, then hovers,

137
00:18:04,067 --> 00:18:09,030
then swoops down onto t'prey,
carries it off to t'young 'uns. Looks great.

138
00:18:09,113 --> 00:18:11,491
I've been gonna knock
that wall down for ages.

139
00:18:11,574 --> 00:18:15,286
- What for?
- It's dangerous. I won't let her play near.

140
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:18,623
- If I lived round here, I'd train a young 'un.
- Would yer?

141
00:18:18,706 --> 00:18:20,917
Yer can train 'em.

142
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,086
Do yer know how?

143
00:18:23,711 --> 00:18:27,507
- Do you know?
- No. There's not many that does.

144
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:31,010
They're hard to train.
If they're not kept properly, it's criminal.

145
00:18:31,094 --> 00:18:33,888
- Do yer know anybody who's kept 'em?
- One or two.

146
00:18:33,972 --> 00:18:38,434
But, er, they had to let 'em go
because they're hard to train.

147
00:18:38,518 --> 00:18:41,604
Where can I find out about 'em, then?

148
00:18:41,688 --> 00:18:46,109
Well, probably t'public library.
They'll have some books on 'em.

149
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:47,986
- Where's that?
- Down int' city.

150
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:50,655
Hey, are you a member?

151
00:18:50,738 --> 00:18:53,324
- What do yer mean?
- Are you a member of the library?

152
00:18:53,408 --> 00:18:56,286
I don't know about that.
I only want a book on falconry.

153
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:58,997
You have to be a member
to take a book out.

154
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,709
- I only want one.
- Have you filled one of these forms in?

155
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,173
- No.
- You're not a member, then.

156
00:19:09,257 --> 00:19:12,385
You'll have to take one of these home
for your father to sign.

157
00:19:12,468 --> 00:19:16,014
- Me dad's away.
- You can wait till he comes back home.

158
00:19:16,097 --> 00:19:20,727
- I don't mean that. I mean he's left home.
- I see. Your mother'll have to sign it.

159
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:24,230
Ar, but she's at work
and she'll not be home till tea time.

160
00:19:24,314 --> 00:19:26,232
There's no rush, is there?

161
00:19:26,316 --> 00:19:28,818
I've never broke a book.
I haven't tore it, or...

162
00:19:28,902 --> 00:19:32,780
Look at your hands. They're filthy.
We'll end up with dirty books that way.

163
00:19:32,864 --> 00:19:37,744
- I don't ready dirty books.
- I hope you don't. You're not old enough.

164
00:19:38,161 --> 00:19:41,539
Me mam knows someone who
works here. That'll help, won't it?

165
00:19:41,623 --> 00:19:44,709
No, not at all.
You still have to have the back signed.

166
00:19:44,792 --> 00:19:48,004
To be a member, you'll have
to have somebody over 21

167
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:50,840
who is on the borough
electoral roll to sign it.

168
00:19:50,924 --> 00:19:53,426
- I'm over 21.
- You're not over 21.

169
00:19:53,509 --> 00:19:56,429
- Ar, but I vote.
- You don't vote. You're not...

170
00:19:56,512 --> 00:19:59,265
I vote for me mam.
She dun't like votin', so I do it.

171
00:19:59,557 --> 00:20:04,187
- Just have to wait for it, won't you?
- Where would I find a book? In a shop?

172
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:08,066
You'd have to go down the street.
There's a second-hand bookshop there.

173
00:20:36,177 --> 00:20:39,180
- Hello. Can I help you?
- Yes.

174
00:20:39,264 --> 00:20:45,353
I'm rather interested in No雔 Coward's
autobiography, Present Indicative.

175
00:21:25,643 --> 00:21:28,855
- What's tha got this for? Tha can't read.
- Give us it here.

176
00:21:28,938 --> 00:21:32,108
Get off! Falconry?
What's tha want to know about falconry?

177
00:21:32,191 --> 00:21:34,193
Give it here!

178
00:21:34,277 --> 00:21:36,613
- Where've yer got this from?
- I've lent it.

179
00:21:36,696 --> 00:21:39,574
Stole it, more like.
Where've yer got it from?

180
00:21:39,657 --> 00:21:41,743
A shop in town.

181
00:21:43,494 --> 00:21:48,708
You must be crackers. I could understand
if it were money, but chuff me, not a book!

182
00:21:50,668 --> 00:21:52,086
Have it!

183
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:54,881
Look what yer've done.
I'm lookin' after this book.

184
00:21:54,964 --> 00:21:59,093
- And what better off will yer be?
- A lot. I'm gonna get a kestrel and train it.

185
00:21:59,177 --> 00:22:01,763
Train it? Yer couldn't train a flea.

186
00:22:02,805 --> 00:22:05,099
Anyway, where yer gonna get
a kestrel from?

187
00:22:05,183 --> 00:22:07,101
- I know a nest.
- Yer don't.

188
00:22:07,185 --> 00:22:09,312
- All right, then, I don't.
- Where?

189
00:22:09,395 --> 00:22:11,314
- I'm not tellin'.
- I said, where?

190
00:22:11,397 --> 00:22:14,400
- You're hurtin' me arm!
- Where, then?

191
00:22:14,484 --> 00:22:16,569
Monastery Farm.

192
00:22:18,988 --> 00:22:21,282
Yer could have broke me arm then.

193
00:22:21,366 --> 00:22:24,202
I'll have to see about
goin' round there wi' me gun.

194
00:22:24,285 --> 00:22:27,580
- I'll tell t'farmer on yer.
- Why? What's he got to do with it?

195
00:22:27,664 --> 00:22:30,250
- He protects 'em.
- Protects 'em?

196
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:33,753
Hawks are a menace to farmers.
They eat all the poultry an' that.

197
00:22:33,836 --> 00:22:37,131
Ar, I know. They dive down
onto t'cows and take 'em away.

198
00:22:37,215 --> 00:22:41,678
- Funny bugger.
- Well, yer talk daft. They're only small.

199
00:22:41,761 --> 00:22:45,139
They eat mice, insects,
and little birds sometimes.

200
00:22:45,556 --> 00:22:50,770
Hope I'll be watchin' a bird tonight. She'll
not have feathers. Not all over, anyway.

201
00:22:58,945 --> 00:23:01,823
- Have you had any tea yet, Billy?
- No.

202
00:23:01,906 --> 00:23:05,034
Well, get some, then.
You where t'pantry is.

203
00:23:06,286 --> 00:23:09,622
- How's yer horses gone on, Jud?
- Not bad. Two winners.

204
00:23:09,706 --> 00:23:12,500
You haven't.
Might be gettin' tret tonight, then.

205
00:23:12,584 --> 00:23:15,878
- Oh, somebody treats you every night.
- Shut it!

206
00:23:15,962 --> 00:23:18,965
And don't you be comin' home
blind drunk again, Jud.

207
00:23:19,048 --> 00:23:22,719
- Why? Are yer entertainin'?
- You're kiddin'.

208
00:23:22,802 --> 00:23:26,306
If I entertained as much as you,
I shall do all right, shan't I?

209
00:23:26,389 --> 00:23:30,018
What tripe you've been
goin' out with lately. My God!

210
00:23:31,769 --> 00:23:36,357
- Better'n that cripple you bring home.
- What cripple? Reg? He's not a cripple.

211
00:23:36,441 --> 00:23:41,362
Will be if he comes in here tonight. At
least them I go out with are not tightfisted.

212
00:23:41,446 --> 00:23:46,367
Who is? You chuck your bloody money
around like a Scotchman with no arms!

213
00:23:46,451 --> 00:23:49,871
Have to use a spanner to get
a threepenny bit out of his hand.

214
00:23:49,954 --> 00:23:51,956
Aye, because he's comin' wise to you.

215
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:56,628
Listen, what about him you're goin' wi'?
Tight as a camel's arse in a sandstorm.

216
00:23:56,711 --> 00:24:00,632
Keep yer hand over yer mouth talkin'
about him, cos yer'll get into trouble.

217
00:24:00,715 --> 00:24:03,301
- You're not too big for a hidin'.
- He can't do it.

218
00:24:03,384 --> 00:24:07,096
Who can't? You might find that
he's bigger than what you think.

219
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,307
More chance of gettin' struck by lightnin'.

220
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:14,145
Shut yer face. I'm fed up of it. It's every
Saturday night. I get ready, you're at me.

221
00:24:14,229 --> 00:24:17,398
And I always go out in
a bloomin' mess and all upset.

222
00:24:18,024 --> 00:24:21,110
Gettin' too big for yer boots,
thinking you own t'house.

223
00:24:21,194 --> 00:24:23,363
You don't own it yet, yer know.

224
00:24:23,446 --> 00:24:27,033
- No. I will do one day, though, won't I?
- Over my dead body.

225
00:24:27,116 --> 00:24:31,621
- That's what I says, I'll own it one day.
- I'm sick on it, Jud. I am, pig sick.

226
00:24:31,704 --> 00:24:35,667
I work every day, and every Saturday
night I go for a drink and you upset me.

227
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:38,962
- I don't think I'll go, I'm that fed up.
- I'll not miss yer.

228
00:24:39,045 --> 00:24:41,673
You'll not miss nowt, will you?
You'll be out there.

229
00:24:41,756 --> 00:24:43,841
- Yeah.
- Aye.

230
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:52,725
By, what a smart-lookin' kid int' mirror.
Some bird's gonna be lucky tonight.

231
00:24:52,809 --> 00:24:55,728
Listen to God's gift to woman.

232
00:24:55,812 --> 00:24:58,189
Fancy buying me
a brandy and pep tonight?

233
00:24:58,273 --> 00:25:00,775
Aye. Hope it keeps fine for yer.

234
00:25:07,365 --> 00:25:11,327
These could have done
with a bit of a polish.

235
00:25:11,411 --> 00:25:14,080
Still, never mind, it's gonna be dark soon.

236
00:25:15,206 --> 00:25:18,001
What you gonna do
with yerself tonight, love?

237
00:25:18,084 --> 00:25:20,211
Read me book.

238
00:25:20,295 --> 00:25:23,798
Oh, look at t'time. Five to seven.
I'm gonna be late again.

239
00:25:23,881 --> 00:25:26,843
Listen, Billy, there's two bob here. Chuck?

240
00:25:26,926 --> 00:25:29,929
Get yerself some pop
and some crisps. D'yer hear?

241
00:25:30,013 --> 00:25:31,889
Yeah.

242
00:25:34,684 --> 00:25:37,604
- And don't still be up when I come in.
- No.

243
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:40,815
G'night, then.

244
00:25:52,327 --> 00:25:54,621
? I came home unexpectedly

245
00:25:54,704 --> 00:25:57,707
? And caught her crying needlessly

246
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:00,126
? In the middle of the day

247
00:26:01,878 --> 00:26:06,549
? And it was in the early spring
when flowers bloom and robins sing

248
00:26:06,633 --> 00:26:08,718
? She went away

249
00:26:10,345 --> 00:26:13,640
? And honey, I miss you

250
00:26:15,058 --> 00:26:18,353
? And I'm bein' good

251
00:26:19,812 --> 00:26:23,107
? And I'd love to be with you

252
00:26:24,692 --> 00:26:29,614
? If only I could

253
00:26:34,661 --> 00:26:36,537
Folks, thank you.

254
00:26:38,414 --> 00:26:40,458
Now a Tremeloes number.

255
00:26:40,541 --> 00:26:43,044
Yer can have a good time up to a point,

256
00:26:43,127 --> 00:26:45,964
but there comes a time
when you want to settle down.

257
00:26:46,047 --> 00:26:48,925
I'm gettin' a bit fed up
of workin' all t'time.

258
00:26:49,008 --> 00:26:52,595
There's plenty of time
to settle down, in't there?

259
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:55,390
Depends what yer lookin' for, dun't it?

260
00:26:57,517 --> 00:27:02,146
I just like to come home, get me meal,
get a bath, change and out, me.

261
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:03,314
Not a care int' world.

262
00:27:03,398 --> 00:27:06,317
When you've been married once
and yer marry a wrong 'un,

263
00:27:06,401 --> 00:27:09,946
it makes yer a bit apprehensive
towards gettin'...

264
00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:13,241
Well, you know, don't yer?
Cos he were never good.

265
00:27:13,324 --> 00:27:17,036
But it makes yer a bit more wary
about gettin' married again.

266
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,123
If she wants to go with a different bloke,
it's not up to me.

267
00:27:20,206 --> 00:27:22,750
She's old enough to know her own mind.

268
00:27:22,834 --> 00:27:24,794
- Well, yeah...
- .. settle down.

269
00:27:24,877 --> 00:27:29,090
You can never tell with Billy. I sit
and wonder sometimes what he will do.

270
00:27:29,173 --> 00:27:33,303
Perhaps if he had been brought up
in a different environment

271
00:27:33,386 --> 00:27:37,015
and had a better education, he would
have made more than what he has.

272
00:27:37,098 --> 00:27:41,019
At the moment, he's hopeless.
He's a hopeless case, in't he?

273
00:27:41,102 --> 00:27:43,438
? Oh, won't you please come back?

274
00:27:44,647 --> 00:27:46,983
? Oh, won't you please come back?

275
00:27:52,864 --> 00:27:55,992
I'm happy as I am.
I doubt if I could be any happier.

276
00:27:56,075 --> 00:27:59,621
My lads have got nowt.
I don't know what they're gonna do.

277
00:27:59,704 --> 00:28:02,498
I don't know whether
our Jud wanted to be a miner.

278
00:28:06,794 --> 00:28:10,882
From my point of view, Reg, when
a woman gets to my age, you've two kids,

279
00:28:10,965 --> 00:28:14,344
you want to be settlin' down
wi' a nice house

280
00:28:14,427 --> 00:28:20,225
and somebody to come home to yer,
and be lookin' after 'em.

281
00:28:20,308 --> 00:28:24,229
- Like I look after you.
- Ar, but you're not married to me.

282
00:28:24,312 --> 00:28:27,565
- Never mind. Giz a kiss.
- Don't be so damned daft!

283
00:28:27,649 --> 00:28:30,235
- He's had too much ale again.
- I haven't.

284
00:28:30,318 --> 00:28:31,778
- Yer have.
- I haven't.

285
00:28:31,861 --> 00:28:34,739
Say, Mam, have you brought
that cripple wi' yer?

286
00:28:34,822 --> 00:28:37,867
Keep it shut. Keep it shut.

287
00:28:37,951 --> 00:28:39,661
Keep it shut, all right?

288
00:28:39,786 --> 00:28:43,331
Say, did everybody hear
about him when he got married?

289
00:28:43,414 --> 00:28:47,377
He got confetti on elastic.
That's how tightfisted he is.

290
00:28:49,128 --> 00:28:51,381
If he wants trouble, I'll give him trouble.

291
00:28:51,464 --> 00:28:55,343
? Oh, along the road there lives
a guy I'd like you all to know

292
00:28:56,511 --> 00:28:59,889
? He grew a great big marrow
for the little flower show

293
00:29:00,473 --> 00:29:04,102
? He showed it to a lady
who lived just along the way

294
00:29:04,727 --> 00:29:09,941
? And when she saw the size of it
he heard the lady say

295
00:29:13,778 --> 00:29:15,655
? Ooohhh!

296
00:29:16,948 --> 00:29:18,908
? What a beauty!

297
00:29:18,992 --> 00:29:22,370
? Oh, I've never seen one
as big as that before

298
00:29:23,329 --> 00:29:24,872
? Ooohhh!

299
00:29:24,956 --> 00:29:26,833
? What a whopper!

300
00:29:26,916 --> 00:29:29,419
? It must be 18 inches long or more

301
00:29:30,753 --> 00:29:34,299
? It's such a lovely colour,
it's nice and round and fat

302
00:29:34,549 --> 00:29:37,885
? Whoever thought a marrow
could grow as big as that?

303
00:29:38,678 --> 00:29:40,763
? Ooohhh!

304
00:29:41,764 --> 00:29:44,142
? Oh, what a beauty

305
00:29:44,225 --> 00:29:47,061
? I've never seen one as big as it before

306
00:30:25,683 --> 00:30:27,769
Billy, are tha asleep?

307
00:30:54,379 --> 00:30:56,673
Bleedin' things.

308
00:31:00,885 --> 00:31:03,263
Now, Billy!

309
00:31:03,346 --> 00:31:05,515
- Give over.
- Billy!

310
00:31:05,598 --> 00:31:08,268
Help me get these bleedin' trousers off.

311
00:31:13,439 --> 00:31:16,025
Come on! Don't be all bleedin' night.

312
00:31:20,655 --> 00:31:23,157
I'm fed up with this bloody game.

313
00:31:25,451 --> 00:31:27,954
It's every Saturday night alike.

314
00:31:29,247 --> 00:31:31,749
Don't help, will tha?

315
00:31:48,349 --> 00:31:51,811
Get back to sleep, yer... pig.

316
00:31:52,478 --> 00:31:54,480
Hog. Sow.

317
00:31:54,564 --> 00:31:56,983
Yer drunken bastard.

318
00:31:57,066 --> 00:32:00,945
Tha dun't like bein' called a bastard,
does tha? Yer bastard!

319
00:32:01,029 --> 00:32:03,114
Yer pig.

320
00:32:03,823 --> 00:32:05,992
Pig.

321
00:32:06,075 --> 00:32:07,410
Hog.

322
00:32:07,493 --> 00:32:08,745
Sow.

323
00:32:08,828 --> 00:32:11,331
Drunken... bastard.

324
00:32:11,623 --> 00:32:13,958
Bastard. Bastard.

325
00:32:14,042 --> 00:32:15,668
Drunken... pig.

326
00:32:16,085 --> 00:32:18,588
Pig.

327
00:32:22,759 --> 00:32:25,178
Billy! Billy!

328
00:35:13,814 --> 00:35:16,900
"Three good meals a day
I'll give him for about a fortnight. "

329
00:35:16,983 --> 00:35:20,695
"If a piece of meat held between
the finger and thumb of the gloved hand

330
00:35:20,779 --> 00:35:26,243
is offered to the hawk, it will probably
bend down and pull at it with its beak. "

331
00:35:55,605 --> 00:35:56,940
C'mon.

332
00:36:20,088 --> 00:36:23,258
"As soon as the hawk
will come a leash length indoors,

333
00:36:23,341 --> 00:36:27,304
she may be tried off a fence
or gatepost out of doors. "

334
00:36:27,387 --> 00:36:32,392
"It is quite likely that although she was
coming to the fist promptly indoors,

335
00:36:32,475 --> 00:36:34,728
she will now refuse to come at all. "

336
00:36:34,811 --> 00:36:40,025
"She will stand looking around her and
ignoring the meat and fist in front of her. "

337
00:37:03,048 --> 00:37:05,175
"When she will come
a leash length outside,

338
00:37:05,258 --> 00:37:09,721
she can be called greater distances
by means of a creance,

339
00:37:09,804 --> 00:37:13,266
a long cord which is attached
to the hawk to prevent her escaping. "

340
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:16,478
"With luck,
she will not attempt to fly away. "

341
00:37:34,788 --> 00:37:36,873
Come on, then.

342
00:37:41,503 --> 00:37:44,256
Kes! Tck, tck, tck, tck, tck.

343
00:37:44,339 --> 00:37:46,508
Tck, tck, tck, tck, tck. Come on, lass.

344
00:37:46,591 --> 00:37:48,885
Tck, tck, tck, tck, tck.

345
00:37:50,512 --> 00:37:53,181
Come on, Kes! Tck, tck, tck, tck, tck.

346
00:37:53,515 --> 00:37:56,643
Come on, Kes! Tck, tck, tck, tck, tck.

347
00:37:57,811 --> 00:38:00,397
Come on, then. Tck, tck, tck, tck, tck.

348
00:38:01,898 --> 00:38:04,234
Tck, tck, tck, tck, tck. Come on, Kes.

349
00:38:46,743 --> 00:38:50,079
Come on, boys, get ready!

350
00:38:50,163 --> 00:38:52,248
Get ready now, you.

351
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:55,460
Skiving again, Guthrie.

352
00:38:55,543 --> 00:38:58,338
No, sir. Mr Farthing
has been talking to me.

353
00:38:58,421 --> 00:39:01,591
I'll bet that was stimulating
for him, wasn't it, lad?

354
00:39:01,674 --> 00:39:05,512
- What does that mean, sir?
- The conversation. What do you think?

355
00:39:05,595 --> 00:39:07,555
Does it mean "stimulate", sir?

356
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:13,186
Stimulating, you fool!
S- t-i-m-i-I-a-t-i-n-g. Stimulating.

357
00:39:15,146 --> 00:39:17,982
Come on, get ready.
You're two weeks late already.

358
00:39:20,902 --> 00:39:24,531
You three, get down,
before I come and put yer down.

359
00:39:27,117 --> 00:39:31,329
Casper, what d'you think you're doing?
Get down. Why aren't you changed?

360
00:39:31,412 --> 00:39:35,583
- I've no kit, sir.
- Casper, you make me sick.

361
00:39:35,667 --> 00:39:39,629
Every lesson it's the same old story,
"Please, sir, I've no kit, sir. "

362
00:39:39,712 --> 00:39:45,969
Every lesson for four years, you've
begged, borrowed, skived and scrounged.

363
00:39:46,052 --> 00:39:49,597
Why is it, Casper, when all this lot
can provide kit, you can't?

364
00:39:49,681 --> 00:39:52,684
Don't know. Me mam says
it's a waste of money now I'm leavin'.

365
00:39:52,767 --> 00:39:55,562
You haven't been leaving
the past four years, have you?

366
00:39:55,645 --> 00:39:56,855
No, sir.

367
00:39:56,938 --> 00:39:59,899
- Use your spending money.
- Don't like football, sir.

368
00:39:59,983 --> 00:40:03,319
- What's that got to do with it, Casper?
- Don't know.

369
00:40:03,403 --> 00:40:07,240
- Anyway, I don't get enough.
- Get a job, then, lad. Get a job.

370
00:40:07,323 --> 00:40:10,034
- I've got one, sir.
- They pay you, don't they?

371
00:40:10,118 --> 00:40:13,621
Yeah, but I have to give it to me mam.
I'm payin' me fines, like...

372
00:40:13,705 --> 00:40:17,667
You should keep out of trouble, lad!
Keep out of trouble.

373
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:22,422
- I haven't bin in trouble since last time.
- I'll get you some kit, Casper.

374
00:40:23,214 --> 00:40:26,050
- Tha's had it now, Casper.
- Shut thi mouth!

375
00:40:27,302 --> 00:40:29,804
Right, Casper. Get into those.

376
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:35,935
- They'll not fit me.
- You can get into them, can't you?

377
00:40:36,019 --> 00:40:37,562
Yes, sir.

378
00:40:37,645 --> 00:40:40,482
They'll keep your cobblers warm, Casper.

379
00:40:42,233 --> 00:40:45,862
- Take your vest and underpants off.
- Don't wear 'em, sir.

380
00:40:47,655 --> 00:40:51,618
Casper, tuck 'em in.
Thi privates are showin'.

381
00:40:51,701 --> 00:40:53,661
The muscleman o't'year!

382
00:40:55,747 --> 00:40:59,626
- He's just come back from Biafra.
- Pull them up, Casper!

383
00:40:59,709 --> 00:41:02,754
- Pull them up!
- Like that, sir?

384
00:41:02,837 --> 00:41:05,673
Pull them down, Casper.

385
00:41:05,757 --> 00:41:08,009
You're too daft to laugh at.

386
00:41:08,092 --> 00:41:10,386
Right. They'll do there.

387
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:15,016
You lot, come on, get changed.
Wasted enough time already.

388
00:41:15,099 --> 00:41:17,811
I'll give you a sample
of my footballing skills.

389
00:41:17,894 --> 00:41:21,105
A rare delight.

390
00:41:25,068 --> 00:41:27,570
Watch yourself, Casper!

391
00:41:29,114 --> 00:41:31,616
I won't tell you again, Crossland!

392
00:41:32,242 --> 00:41:34,327
Come on, move.

393
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,455
Off that goal post!

394
00:41:37,539 --> 00:41:40,834
Off that goal post.
I'll be up there in a minute!

395
00:41:40,917 --> 00:41:44,963
Come here, Tibbut.
We'll pick two teams. You're the captain.

396
00:41:45,046 --> 00:41:48,049
Right, line up on the halfway line, quickly.

397
00:41:48,133 --> 00:41:51,928
- I'll have first pick. Paget.
- That's not fair. You'll get t'best players.

398
00:41:52,011 --> 00:41:54,973
D'you wanna play football,
or d'you wanna do some maths?

399
00:41:55,056 --> 00:41:57,058
Paget, then. Come here.

400
00:41:57,142 --> 00:41:58,560
- Speed.
- Walker.

401
00:41:58,643 --> 00:42:00,019
- Clark.
- Crossland.

402
00:42:00,103 --> 00:42:02,313
- Kelsey.
- Rowe.

403
00:42:03,648 --> 00:42:05,942
Er... Clegg.

404
00:42:07,235 --> 00:42:09,362
Bloody hell, I'm frozen already.

405
00:42:09,446 --> 00:42:11,573
- Joyce.
- Birkinshaw.

406
00:42:11,656 --> 00:42:13,992
- Ryder.
- Parker.

407
00:42:14,075 --> 00:42:16,661
- Norton.
- Come on, Parker.

408
00:42:17,537 --> 00:42:20,165
Casper, I've got to have yer. Come on.

409
00:42:20,248 --> 00:42:23,042
Don't act the goat.
Come on, put 'em round your waist.

410
00:42:23,126 --> 00:42:25,003
Now.

411
00:42:29,048 --> 00:42:33,011
Right, we'll play with the wind,
downhill, this way.

412
00:42:33,094 --> 00:42:35,680
Paget, you're inside right. Come on.

413
00:42:42,312 --> 00:42:46,566
- Who are you today, sir? Liverpool?
- Don't you know your club colours?

414
00:42:46,649 --> 00:42:50,278
- Manchester United, this.
- Are you playing Denis Law, striker?

415
00:42:50,361 --> 00:42:54,574
No. Charlton today, lad.
All over the field. Too cold for striker.

416
00:42:54,657 --> 00:42:57,243
Charlton's not as quick
ont' turn as Law, is he?

417
00:42:57,327 --> 00:42:59,704
- You tryin' to tell me about football?
- No. I...

418
00:42:59,788 --> 00:43:03,958
You trying to tell me? Anyway,
Denis Law's in the wash this week.

419
00:43:08,463 --> 00:43:11,591
- Nobody's in goal, sir.
- No goalie, sir.

420
00:43:11,674 --> 00:43:13,718
- Who's in the goals?
- Casper.

421
00:43:13,802 --> 00:43:17,847
- Casper, what position are you playing?
- Don't know, sir. Inside left?

422
00:43:17,931 --> 00:43:20,975
How can you be inside left
back there, idiot? In the goals.

423
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:25,146
- I can't...
- Now's your chance to learn. In the goals.

424
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:27,565
Quick about it.

425
00:43:27,649 --> 00:43:32,403
- We're Manchester United. Who are you?
- Spurs, then there's no clash of colours.

426
00:43:32,487 --> 00:43:38,451
Right, then, it's Manchester United versus
Spurs in this cup tie here at Old Trafford.

427
00:43:38,535 --> 00:43:42,163
And it's the fair-haired,
slightly balding Charlton to kick off.

428
00:43:55,009 --> 00:43:58,513
Come on, Speed.
What you playin' at, lad?

429
00:43:58,596 --> 00:44:01,808
Yer should be on the move, lad.
It was at yer feet!

430
00:44:01,891 --> 00:44:04,227
Cross it, Ryder. Quickly.

431
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:06,813
Where's t'rest of my team?

432
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:17,407
Come on, quickly, Casper. I've never
seen such slack work in my life.

433
00:44:21,578 --> 00:44:24,414
- What's that for, sir?
- Slack work, lad. Slack work.

434
00:44:24,497 --> 00:44:27,083
Hit that ball up the field, Parker.

435
00:44:29,586 --> 00:44:31,838
I have to keep this shirt on after.

436
00:44:31,921 --> 00:44:33,715
Cross the ball!

437
00:44:33,798 --> 00:44:36,217
And Charlton goes through, and...

438
00:44:36,301 --> 00:44:38,803
Oh, never! Never!

439
00:44:41,222 --> 00:44:42,974
- Penalty!
- Never.

440
00:44:43,057 --> 00:44:45,643
Who do you think you are? Bremner?

441
00:44:47,896 --> 00:44:50,607
- Penalty.
- No, it weren't, sir!

442
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:52,775
Outside that semicircle.

443
00:44:56,362 --> 00:44:59,991
- Shall I take it, sir?
- I take the penalties on this team.

444
00:45:04,078 --> 00:45:06,664
No one moves till this ball's kicked.

445
00:45:10,585 --> 00:45:13,421
Just watch this, Guthrie. Right, Clegg?

446
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:20,428
You moved. You moved. Put it back.

447
00:45:27,852 --> 00:45:29,729
Penalty.

448
00:45:31,022 --> 00:45:33,525
Behind the 18-yard line.

449
00:45:34,984 --> 00:45:38,113
Tha better save it, Cleggy!
Else I'll drop tha.

450
00:45:41,116 --> 00:45:43,701
- He moved!
- I didn't move, sir.

451
00:45:43,785 --> 00:45:46,287
The referee's decision is final.

452
00:46:02,262 --> 00:46:07,475
- You should have done it the first time.
- And that, boys, is how to take a penalty.

453
00:46:08,226 --> 00:46:10,728
Look one way and kick the other.

454
00:46:12,105 --> 00:46:13,815
Come on, Tibbut, lad.

455
00:46:13,898 --> 00:46:17,527
And Bobby Charlton has
equalised for Manchester United,

456
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:19,612
and the score is one goal each.

457
00:46:25,452 --> 00:46:30,039
That fat twat!
He wants bleedin' milkin'. That big fat git!

458
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,085
What did you say? What did you say?

459
00:46:34,169 --> 00:46:37,464
- Nowt, sir.
- Get off! In that changin' room! Get off!

460
00:46:37,547 --> 00:46:40,133
- I didn't say nowt, sir.
- Off!

461
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:45,680
- I won't tolerate that on a football pitch.
- That's our captain, sir.

462
00:46:45,763 --> 00:46:49,392
I don't care who he is.
You play this game like gentlemen.

463
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:52,896
Right inside!

464
00:46:55,398 --> 00:46:57,901
An early bath for you, lad.

465
00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:04,073
- I'll bounce the ball up.
- It's not fair! They never get sent off!

466
00:47:04,157 --> 00:47:08,995
- I shall be up there in a minute!
- They never get sent off, sir.

467
00:47:10,371 --> 00:47:12,457
Off!

468
00:47:20,799 --> 00:47:23,301
What d'you think you two are doing?

469
00:47:25,929 --> 00:47:28,431
- What are you doing?
- Practising, sir.

470
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:31,643
Show me what you're doing.

471
00:47:59,379 --> 00:48:01,464
Casper!

472
00:48:02,966 --> 00:48:06,886
Casper, what do you think you are, lad?
An ape?

473
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:10,348
- All he needs now is a banana.
- Get down. I'll make you red hot.

474
00:48:16,396 --> 00:48:19,023
Thank you. Now, for my next trick...

475
00:48:19,107 --> 00:48:23,069
I'll show you a trick! Get back in that goal!

476
00:48:29,325 --> 00:48:33,079
- What's up?
- That hurt. That ball, it's hard as iron.

477
00:48:33,163 --> 00:48:35,665
Ar, I know. It's like a stone, innit?

478
00:48:36,541 --> 00:48:40,295
- I'm bloody freezin'.
- My feet are like blocks o' ice.

479
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:43,381
Me knees, look at 'em. They're goin' pale.

480
00:48:43,465 --> 00:48:46,050
Look at t'colour. It's gone white.

481
00:48:46,634 --> 00:48:48,803
Oh, I wish I'd brought a note.

482
00:49:09,115 --> 00:49:12,535
- Great goal, that, sir.
- I'll give yer "great goal", lad.

483
00:49:12,619 --> 00:49:17,207
- Spurs into the sixth round of t'Cup.
- Sixth round? I'll give you six of the best.

484
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:20,001
- Lost again, sir?
- Fetch my tracksuit.

485
00:49:20,084 --> 00:49:23,213
- Better luck next time.
- Disgusting!

486
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:34,766
- In a hurry, Casper?
- I have to get home, sir.

487
00:49:34,849 --> 00:49:36,893
- Really?
- Yes, sir.

488
00:49:36,976 --> 00:49:39,103
- Forgotten something?
- No, sir.

489
00:49:39,187 --> 00:49:41,272
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.

490
00:49:42,565 --> 00:49:45,151
- What about the showers?
- I've had one, sir.

491
00:49:47,737 --> 00:49:50,740
- You can ask any of 'em, sir.
- I'll just do that.

492
00:49:51,908 --> 00:49:54,285
- Have you seen him have a shower?
- No, sir.

493
00:49:54,369 --> 00:49:58,498
- Have you?
- No, sir.

494
00:50:01,334 --> 00:50:03,711
- Have you seen him have a shower?
- Who, sir?

495
00:50:03,795 --> 00:50:06,214
- Casper.
- When, sir?

496
00:50:06,297 --> 00:50:09,509
- Just now. Has he had a shower?
- Had a shower, sir?

497
00:50:09,592 --> 00:50:11,553
Has Casper had a shower?

498
00:50:11,636 --> 00:50:14,681
What you fooling about at, lad?
Has Casper had a shower?

499
00:50:14,764 --> 00:50:18,393
- I don't think so, sir.
- Speed, you'll get what Casper just had.

500
00:50:19,394 --> 00:50:23,523
No one's seen you have a shower,
Casper. Cos you haven't had one.

501
00:50:23,731 --> 00:50:27,652
- Me mam says I ain't to have a shower.
- Come here. What's your mother say?

502
00:50:27,735 --> 00:50:30,864
I ain't to have a shower, sir.
I've got a cold.

503
00:50:30,947 --> 00:50:34,325
- Where's your note, then?
- Can I bring it this afternoon, sir?

504
00:50:34,409 --> 00:50:36,995
That's no good, lad. I want one now.

505
00:50:37,078 --> 00:50:40,415
Any boy wishing to be excused
physical education, or showers,

506
00:50:40,498 --> 00:50:44,961
must, at the time of the lesson,
produce a sealed letter of explanation

507
00:50:45,044 --> 00:50:47,964
signed by one of his parents
or his legal guardian.

508
00:50:48,047 --> 00:50:50,842
- Go on, sir, let me go home.
- You can go, lad.

509
00:50:50,925 --> 00:50:53,511
Hey, come here.
When you've had a shower.

510
00:50:55,263 --> 00:50:57,807
- I haven't a towel, sir.
- Borrow one.

511
00:50:57,891 --> 00:51:01,519
- Nobody'll lend me one.
- Have a drip-dry, then. Shower, come on.

512
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:05,982
- MacDowall.
- Sir?

513
00:51:06,065 --> 00:51:07,942
Come here, lad.

514
00:51:08,026 --> 00:51:11,529
Come here. What's this?

515
00:51:11,613 --> 00:51:13,698
Our dog did it, sir.

516
00:51:14,866 --> 00:51:16,659
- Your dog did it?
- Aye.

517
00:51:16,743 --> 00:51:19,454
It bit me while I were fightin' it last night.

518
00:51:20,955 --> 00:51:23,541
A dog wearing nylons, lads.

519
00:51:31,674 --> 00:51:33,760
Bloody heck!

520
00:51:39,682 --> 00:51:41,768
- Still in a hurry?
- Can I go now, sir?

521
00:51:41,851 --> 00:51:44,395
- Have a proper wash.
- I've had one, sir.

522
00:51:44,479 --> 00:51:47,649
- In the shower, lad. In the shower.
- I've got to get home.

523
00:51:47,732 --> 00:51:49,818
In the shower.

524
00:51:51,778 --> 00:51:54,447
Ryder, Speed, come here.

525
00:51:54,531 --> 00:51:57,117
Yes, you two. Come on.

526
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,786
Stay here and see that
he doesn't come out.

527
00:51:59,869 --> 00:52:02,330
- Do what, sir?
- I said, stay there.

528
00:52:02,413 --> 00:52:04,916
See that he doesn't come out.

529
00:52:12,465 --> 00:52:15,593
Agh! Sir! It's gone cold!

530
00:52:16,427 --> 00:52:21,432
Got a sweat on, Casper? I thought you
might need a cooler after your exertions.

531
00:52:21,516 --> 00:52:27,230
It's not right, sir. I'll catch me death
of cold in here. It's not right.

532
00:52:27,313 --> 00:52:30,692
Was it right when you
let that goal in deliberately?

533
00:52:34,529 --> 00:52:37,240
- Can't we go for us dinners?
- No, you can stay there.

534
00:52:37,323 --> 00:52:40,952
- We're servers.
- I don't care. They can serve themselves.

535
00:52:43,288 --> 00:52:45,999
You shouldn't put me in goal.
You know I'm useless.

536
00:52:46,082 --> 00:52:48,585
Now's your chance to learn.

537
00:52:48,668 --> 00:52:52,338
Shall we let him out, sir?
He'll catch his death of cold.

538
00:52:52,422 --> 00:52:55,633
- He'll catch pneumonia.
- I don't care what he gets.

539
00:52:55,717 --> 00:52:58,636
If he thinks I'm running
my blood to water for 90 minutes,

540
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:03,308
for him to deliberately throw the game
away, he's got another think coming.

541
00:53:05,935 --> 00:53:08,062
Sir, we've got to go for us dinner.

542
00:53:15,195 --> 00:53:19,032
- Get down!
- He looks like a bleedin' snake!

543
00:53:19,115 --> 00:53:21,701
Think yourself lucky.

544
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:42,740
- 'Ey up, Jud. How yer doin'?
- Rough, man.

545
00:54:42,824 --> 00:54:46,161
Why? You should be on top of the world
on a day like today.

546
00:54:46,244 --> 00:54:49,372
Another ten minutes
and I'll be at t'bottom of it.

547
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:09,035
? Only, O Lord, in Thy dear love

548
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:15,291
? Fit us for perfect rest above

549
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:21,131
? And help us this and every day

550
00:56:21,214 --> 00:56:29,430
? To live more nearly as we pray

551
00:56:29,514 --> 00:56:35,311
? Amen

552
00:56:41,025 --> 00:56:46,739
This morning's reading is taken from
Matthew, chapter 18, verses 10-14.

553
00:56:47,323 --> 00:56:50,326
"Never despise one of these little ones,
I tell you. "

554
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:52,662
"They have their guardian angels
in heaven

555
00:56:52,745 --> 00:56:56,332
who look continually
on the face of my heavenly father. "

556
00:56:56,416 --> 00:57:00,086
"Suppose a man has a hundred sheep.
If one of them strays,

557
00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:02,964
does he not leave
the other 99 on the hillside

558
00:57:03,047 --> 00:57:05,383
and go in search of the one that strayed?"

559
00:57:05,467 --> 00:57:08,511
"And if he should find it, I tell you this,

560
00:57:08,595 --> 00:57:13,099
he is more delighted over that sheep
than over the 99 that never strayed. "

561
00:57:13,183 --> 00:57:16,019
"In the same way,
it is not your heavenly father's will

562
00:57:16,102 --> 00:57:21,107
that one of these little ones should be
lost. " Here ends this morning's reading.

563
00:57:26,321 --> 00:57:28,406
Stop! Stop that infernal coughing.

564
00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:34,204
Every morning alike. Clear your throats
on the way to school, not here.

565
00:57:34,287 --> 00:57:38,041
Sounds more like a dirt track
than an assembly hall.

566
00:57:42,170 --> 00:57:45,507
Come out! Come out, that boy!

567
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:50,011
Who coughed? Mr Hesketh,
somewhere near you, I think.

568
00:57:50,094 --> 00:57:52,096
Fetch that boy out!

569
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:54,557
MacDowall, it was you.
You were coughing.

570
00:57:54,641 --> 00:57:56,643
- It weren't.
- Yes, it was. I heard you.

571
00:57:56,726 --> 00:57:58,520
- It weren't, sir.
- Don't argue.

572
00:57:58,603 --> 00:58:01,439
- It weren't me, honest.
- Headmaster's study.

573
00:58:01,523 --> 00:58:04,567
MacDowall! I might have known!
Get to my office!

574
00:58:04,651 --> 00:58:07,779
- It weren't me, sir.
- And heaven help you.

575
00:58:10,573 --> 00:58:12,742
We will now say the Lord's Prayer.

576
00:58:13,326 --> 00:58:15,912
Hands together, eyes closed.

577
00:58:15,995 --> 00:58:17,622
Our Father...

578
00:58:17,705 --> 00:58:19,624
Our Father

579
00:58:19,707 --> 00:58:23,837
which art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

580
00:58:25,004 --> 00:58:27,423
Thy kingdom come.

581
00:58:27,507 --> 00:58:29,676
Thy will be done...

582
00:58:37,350 --> 00:58:40,436
- Does he bite yer?
- He's had a little kid's hand off nearly.

583
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:44,482
Has it? My, my, my!
What's it fastened on? A wire?

584
00:58:44,566 --> 00:58:48,194
Aye. It's broke this off an' all.
Just darted at t'kid and got him.

585
00:58:48,278 --> 00:58:52,115
Well, I don't know, I'm sure.
Is that what you've got t'glove on for?

586
00:58:52,198 --> 00:58:55,118
- Yeah. Just in case it gets me.
- Aye. Aye.

587
00:58:56,077 --> 00:58:57,871
- What d'yer call it?
- Kes.

588
00:58:57,954 --> 00:59:01,916
Kes? Aye. He is a nice bird.

589
00:59:05,545 --> 00:59:07,422
I shouldn't like to handle him.

590
00:59:07,505 --> 00:59:11,134
Casper! Casper! Up, lad! On yer feet!

591
00:59:11,968 --> 00:59:15,138
- You were asleep, weren't you, Casper?
- I don't know, sir.

592
00:59:15,221 --> 00:59:17,849
I know! You were. You were asleep.

593
00:59:17,932 --> 00:59:20,518
Why were you asleep,
you irreverent scoundrel?

594
00:59:20,602 --> 00:59:22,604
- Don't know, sir.
- I know why!

595
00:59:22,687 --> 00:59:26,191
You were roaming the streets at night
instead of being home in bed.

596
00:59:26,274 --> 00:59:31,488
See me in my office afterwards! I'll give
you something to sleep about! Sit!

597
00:59:33,656 --> 00:59:35,533
Here are the announcements.

598
00:59:35,617 --> 00:59:40,830
The youth employment officer will be
here today to meet the Easter leavers.

599
00:59:41,164 --> 00:59:43,249
Your parents should have been told.

600
00:59:43,333 --> 00:59:47,504
If any boy has forgotten and thinks his
parents may wish to attend his interview,

601
00:59:47,587 --> 00:59:52,801
then he can consult the list on the main
notice board for the approximate times.

602
00:59:54,135 --> 00:59:58,973
And finally, for three members
of the smokers' union

603
00:59:59,057 --> 01:00:02,435
caught yesterday behind
the games storeroom,

604
01:00:02,519 --> 01:00:06,272
there will be a meeting
with me after assembly,

605
01:00:06,356 --> 01:00:10,693
when I will be pleased to see
and hear them pay their dues.

606
01:00:10,902 --> 01:00:13,947
He'd better not stick me.
I'm fetchin' me father up if he does.

607
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:17,158
What yer bringin' yer father down for?
He don't do nowt.

608
01:00:17,242 --> 01:00:19,911
- How d'yer mean?
- Last time, he got stick an' all.

609
01:00:19,994 --> 01:00:22,372
Shut up, will tha? I'm sick of hearin' yer.

610
01:00:22,455 --> 01:00:24,707
When he came,
they were laughin' at him.

611
01:00:24,791 --> 01:00:27,043
- Yer what?
- Yeah. Weren't they?

612
01:00:27,877 --> 01:00:30,463
Don't say that about my father, right?

613
01:00:32,715 --> 01:00:35,718
He's not gonna beat me, anyhow.

614
01:00:35,802 --> 01:00:38,888
- What do you want?
- I've got a message for Mr Gryce.

615
01:00:38,972 --> 01:00:40,849
Better wait in the queue, then.

616
01:00:40,932 --> 01:00:44,602
He likes to keep yer waitin'.
He thinks it makes it worse.

617
01:00:44,686 --> 01:00:47,981
He can keep me till four o'clock.
I'm not bothered.

618
01:00:48,064 --> 01:00:50,775
I'd rather the cane than do lessons.

619
01:00:50,859 --> 01:00:53,153
Come here, you.

620
01:00:53,236 --> 01:00:56,156
Save us these till after
we come outta Gryce's.

621
01:00:56,239 --> 01:00:57,866
He'll think I'm a smoker.

622
01:00:57,949 --> 01:01:02,162
He'll not search you but he'll search us,
and if he finds 'em, we'll get two extra.

623
01:01:02,245 --> 01:01:04,706
- I don't want 'em.
- You want some fist instead?

624
01:01:04,789 --> 01:01:08,126
- You want to take them?
- You'd better, lad.

625
01:01:09,461 --> 01:01:12,755
OK. But if I get caned,
you give me something.

626
01:01:12,839 --> 01:01:15,758
Aye. Some fist if yer don't.

627
01:01:18,261 --> 01:01:20,930
'Ey up, he's here - Gryce Pudding.

628
01:01:21,473 --> 01:01:23,725
Single file.

629
01:01:23,808 --> 01:01:25,810
Right. You lost, lad?

630
01:01:25,894 --> 01:01:29,022
- Please, sir, I'm going...
- On yer way, form room.

631
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:34,569
You lot, inside.

632
01:01:38,239 --> 01:01:40,575
Same old faces.

633
01:01:40,742 --> 01:01:43,870
Same old faces.

634
01:01:44,579 --> 01:01:46,831
Ten years this school's been opened,

635
01:01:46,915 --> 01:01:51,878
and ten years have we seen, after
every assembly, a line of boys here,

636
01:01:51,961 --> 01:01:54,506
and the same old faces.

637
01:01:54,589 --> 01:01:58,760
- Sir, I've got a message...
- Shut up. Don't interrupt. Close the door.

638
01:02:00,970 --> 01:02:04,098
I've taught in this city for over 30 years.

639
01:02:04,265 --> 01:02:08,603
I taught some of your parents -
your father, MacDowall -

640
01:02:08,686 --> 01:02:11,106
in the old slum schools in the city,

641
01:02:11,189 --> 01:02:16,194
before they built this fine estate,
and this wonderful school.

642
01:02:17,195 --> 01:02:20,698
Things are no better now
than they were then.

643
01:02:20,782 --> 01:02:23,409
I just can't understand this generation.

644
01:02:23,493 --> 01:02:26,287
I thought I knew something
about young people.

645
01:02:26,371 --> 01:02:29,666
I should be able to,
you know, with my experience.

646
01:02:29,749 --> 01:02:31,918
But with you, no.

647
01:02:32,001 --> 01:02:36,589
It just seems a complete
waste of money and a waste of time.

648
01:02:37,006 --> 01:02:39,676
And it's a waste of time
talking to you now.

649
01:02:39,759 --> 01:02:42,095
- You're not listening, are you?
- Yes, sir.

650
01:02:42,178 --> 01:02:44,973
You're not! Crossland,
you're not listening, are you?

651
01:02:45,056 --> 01:02:47,100
- I am, sir.
- None of you are listening!

652
01:02:47,183 --> 01:02:49,769
Look at that glazed expression
on your faces.

653
01:02:49,853 --> 01:02:54,065
You never listen!
Yours is the generation that never listens!

654
01:02:54,149 --> 01:02:56,734
Cos we can never tell you anything.

655
01:02:57,569 --> 01:03:00,488
You're the sophisticated ones,

656
01:03:00,572 --> 01:03:03,783
with all your music, and your gear.

657
01:03:03,867 --> 01:03:07,412
But, you know, it's superficial.
It's a sheen.

658
01:03:07,495 --> 01:03:10,623
There's nothing solid
or worthwhile underneath.

659
01:03:10,707 --> 01:03:13,418
And why do I know this?

660
01:03:13,501 --> 01:03:17,839
Why do I know there's been
no advance in discipline or decency,

661
01:03:17,922 --> 01:03:20,133
or morals or manners?

662
01:03:20,216 --> 01:03:25,805
Why do I know it? Because I still
have to use this to you boys every day.

663
01:03:26,055 --> 01:03:30,769
Why? In the '20s and '30s,
I could understand it.

664
01:03:30,852 --> 01:03:32,645
They were hard times,

665
01:03:32,729 --> 01:03:36,274
but they produced qualities in people
that you lot will never have.

666
01:03:36,357 --> 01:03:39,235
I can be stopped in the street
by someone I taught then.

667
01:03:39,319 --> 01:03:44,199
We'll talk about the old days, and we'll
laugh about the thrashings I gave him.

668
01:03:44,282 --> 01:03:46,868
But what do I get from you lot?

669
01:03:48,203 --> 01:03:51,748
A honk from a greasy,
pimply-faced youth

670
01:03:52,165 --> 01:03:55,084
sitting at the wheel
of a big second-hand car.

671
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:59,714
I don't know. I just don't know.

672
01:04:00,507 --> 01:04:05,512
No guts! No backbone!
Nothing to commend you whatsoever.

673
01:04:05,595 --> 01:04:08,515
Mere fodder for the mass media.

674
01:04:12,602 --> 01:04:16,856
And so, until someone
produces a better solution,

675
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:19,442
I'll continue to use this cane,

676
01:04:19,526 --> 01:04:24,447
knowing fully well that you'll be
back for it time and time and time again.

677
01:04:26,157 --> 01:04:30,120
You smokers will go out of here
with your hands ringing.

678
01:04:30,203 --> 01:04:34,541
Will it stop you smoking? You're already
looking forward to smoking at break.

679
01:04:34,624 --> 01:04:36,709
- What are you grinning about?
- Not grinnin'.

680
01:04:36,793 --> 01:04:40,255
You are! I'll bet you're already
thinking about smoking at break.

681
01:04:40,338 --> 01:04:42,257
Empty your pockets.

682
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:46,970
I bet they're loaded with cigarettes.
Come on, all of you, empty your pockets.

683
01:04:49,681 --> 01:04:52,183
- Please, sir...
- Quiet. Empty your pockets.

684
01:04:52,267 --> 01:04:54,602
- You don't understand.
- Empty your pockets.

685
01:04:55,186 --> 01:04:57,063
Disgusting!

686
01:04:59,941 --> 01:05:01,901
Please, sir.

687
01:05:01,985 --> 01:05:04,404
You again? You again?!

688
01:05:04,487 --> 01:05:07,532
- Yes, sir.
- Empty your pockets.

689
01:05:07,615 --> 01:05:12,036
- But, sir, I've got a message from Mrs...
- Empty your pockets!

690
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:16,332
I don't believe it.

691
01:05:17,917 --> 01:05:20,170
I don't believe this.

692
01:05:22,255 --> 01:05:26,509
Empty your pockets, lad.
Empty your pockets when you're told!

693
01:05:26,593 --> 01:05:28,803
Come on, lad.

694
01:05:28,887 --> 01:05:30,763
Ah!

695
01:05:32,432 --> 01:05:36,102
A regular little cigarette factory,
aren't you?

696
01:05:36,186 --> 01:05:38,271
Yes, sir.

697
01:05:42,358 --> 01:05:44,861
Put that rubbish away!

698
01:06:07,217 --> 01:06:10,303
Now I hope it's going to be
a lesson to you.

699
01:06:10,386 --> 01:06:13,264
I don't suppose for one minute it will be.

700
01:06:13,348 --> 01:06:17,769
I don't doubt before the end of the week
you'll be back in here again

701
01:06:17,852 --> 01:06:20,438
for exactly the same crime, smoking.

702
01:06:21,773 --> 01:06:25,819
Perhaps, once in a while, it might sink in.

703
01:06:25,902 --> 01:06:29,114
- Yes, sir.
- That you're wasting your money,

704
01:06:29,197 --> 01:06:31,282
that it's your money you're burning,

705
01:06:31,366 --> 01:06:35,286
and it's your hands that get caned
when you come in here.

706
01:06:38,623 --> 01:06:41,960
Good morning. Entry of the gladiators.
Where have you been?

707
01:06:42,043 --> 01:06:44,295
- Been to see Mr Gryce, sir.
- For the stick?

708
01:06:44,379 --> 01:06:45,839
- Yes, sir.
- How many?

709
01:06:45,922 --> 01:06:48,007
- Two.
- Did it hurt?

710
01:06:48,091 --> 01:06:51,386
- Not bad.
- Right. Hope it didn't.

711
01:06:51,886 --> 01:06:53,972
Go on, sit down.

712
01:06:56,141 --> 01:06:58,184
Right now, fact.

713
01:06:58,268 --> 01:07:01,813
Anne, tell me what a fact is.

714
01:07:01,896 --> 01:07:03,857
Don't give me a fact.

715
01:07:03,940 --> 01:07:08,820
You know, don't say that Guthrie's
got a tatty head or anything like that.

716
01:07:08,903 --> 01:07:12,991
A fact is something where
you find evidence out, like truth.

717
01:07:13,658 --> 01:07:16,703
Something that you know
has actually happened.

718
01:07:16,786 --> 01:07:19,914
This is a fact. All right?
Have you got that clear?

719
01:07:19,998 --> 01:07:22,750
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

720
01:07:22,834 --> 01:07:26,045
Tibbut, sit up straight.

721
01:07:26,129 --> 01:07:29,132
And I want the rest of yer
to look at him - if you can bear it -

722
01:07:29,215 --> 01:07:31,801
and tell me some facts about Tibbut.

723
01:07:32,177 --> 01:07:35,096
- Wolstenholme?
- He's always tryin' to go wi't'lasses.

724
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:37,974
Is he?

725
01:07:38,767 --> 01:07:41,269
- He smokes.
- Do I heck!

726
01:07:41,352 --> 01:07:43,980
- Tha does.
- Get knotted, Guthrie!

727
01:07:44,063 --> 01:07:47,233
I'm not interested in what
he does out of school hours,

728
01:07:47,317 --> 01:07:51,488
as long as he doesn't come into
the class smokin' a fag. All right?

729
01:07:52,697 --> 01:07:55,450
Come on, you people who aren't thinking.

730
01:07:57,076 --> 01:07:58,620
Right, Julie.

731
01:07:58,703 --> 01:08:03,917
I want you to think of an incident that's
happened to you sometime in the past,

732
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:09,088
that is true, and that you think
will interest the rest of the class. All right?

733
01:08:09,422 --> 01:08:11,758
Well, er...

734
01:08:11,841 --> 01:08:15,136
I went to this all-night party yesterday.
And, er...

735
01:08:17,931 --> 01:08:21,810
about three o'clock,
we were dancin' int' garden -

736
01:08:23,144 --> 01:08:26,397
me and her and all the rest,
can't mention names -

737
01:08:26,481 --> 01:08:30,151
and, er, this woman
come across from t'road,

738
01:08:30,235 --> 01:08:32,445
and, er, she tells us to...

739
01:08:32,529 --> 01:08:36,866
to make less noise,
or she'd fetch t'police.

740
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:41,287
So, well... so we said,
let her fetch 'em if she wanted.

741
01:08:41,371 --> 01:08:43,957
So she fetched 'em.

742
01:08:46,376 --> 01:08:50,713
Things that have actually happened.
How about another one?

743
01:08:50,797 --> 01:08:52,966
What about you, Casper?

744
01:08:53,049 --> 01:08:56,136
- Casper!
- What, sir?

745
01:08:56,219 --> 01:09:00,348
"What, sir?"
You'd know if you'd been listening.

746
01:09:00,431 --> 01:09:03,017
What have we just been talking about?

747
01:09:04,144 --> 01:09:06,896
- Stories, sir?
- What kind of stories?

748
01:09:10,358 --> 01:09:13,445
- You haven't been listening, have yer?
- Yes. Some of it.

749
01:09:13,528 --> 01:09:15,613
Some of it?!

750
01:09:16,406 --> 01:09:18,491
Stand up!

751
01:09:23,079 --> 01:09:25,498
You're gonna tell us
a story about yourself.

752
01:09:25,582 --> 01:09:29,210
- I don't know any, sir.
- Well, you stand there till yer do.

753
01:09:32,213 --> 01:09:37,051
Always somebody, isn't there, eh?
Somebody who wants to be awkward.

754
01:09:37,135 --> 01:09:40,763
Just won't be interested,
doesn't matter what you do.

755
01:09:42,056 --> 01:09:44,559
Just like you, Casper.

756
01:09:47,353 --> 01:09:49,439
Come on.

757
01:09:50,398 --> 01:09:52,525
I'll give you two minutes

758
01:09:52,609 --> 01:09:56,571
to think of something, or the whole class
comes back at four o'clock.

759
01:09:56,654 --> 01:09:59,824
- Come on, don't stand there like a nail.
- He is a nail.

760
01:09:59,908 --> 01:10:01,159
Come on.

761
01:10:01,242 --> 01:10:05,914
- I say... tell him.
- Tell him about the hawk, Casper.

762
01:10:05,997 --> 01:10:09,709
If anybody else calls out,
it'll be the last call they make!

763
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:13,671
- Speed?
- He's got this hawk. He's mad over it.

764
01:10:13,755 --> 01:10:18,134
He just goes wi't'hawk all t'time.
He's crackers over it.

765
01:10:18,218 --> 01:10:21,346
- Better than thee, anyroad.
- All right, Casper.

766
01:10:22,555 --> 01:10:24,641
Sit down.

767
01:10:26,392 --> 01:10:30,438
Now, come on, tell us about this hawk.
Where'd you get it from?

768
01:10:30,522 --> 01:10:33,233
- I found it, sir.
- Where?

769
01:10:33,316 --> 01:10:36,152
- Int' woods.
- Where d'you keep it?

770
01:10:36,236 --> 01:10:39,155
- In a shed.
- What do you feed it on?

771
01:10:40,073 --> 01:10:42,575
Beef. Mice. Birds.

772
01:10:43,243 --> 01:10:46,996
Isn't it cruel to keep it in a shed?
Wouldn't it be happier flying free?

773
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:50,583
I don't keep it int' shed all the time, sir.
I fly it every day.

774
01:10:50,667 --> 01:10:54,921
- Doesn't it fly away?
- Course it don't fly away. I've trained it.

775
01:10:55,004 --> 01:10:57,924
Are you gonna tell us about it?
How do you train a hawk?

776
01:10:58,007 --> 01:11:00,969
You have to be right careful wi' 'em,
sir, right patient.

777
01:11:01,052 --> 01:11:03,346
You've got to feed 'em
when they're hungry.

778
01:11:03,429 --> 01:11:06,808
You can only do owt at feedin' time, sir.

779
01:11:06,891 --> 01:11:10,353
- Yeah?
- Got these jesses on, sir, all t'time.

780
01:11:10,437 --> 01:11:13,022
- These what?
- Jesses, sir.

781
01:11:13,106 --> 01:11:15,358
- How do you spell that?
- J-e...

782
01:11:15,442 --> 01:11:19,362
All right. Come out here.
You'd better show us on the board.

783
01:11:19,446 --> 01:11:21,948
"Jesses". That's a new word to me.

784
01:11:22,657 --> 01:11:25,076
Hands up those who've
heard of jesses before?

785
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:27,662
Nobody. Go on, write it up there.

786
01:11:33,042 --> 01:11:35,003
Right. Now tell us what it is.

787
01:11:35,086 --> 01:11:38,756
They're leather straps, sir.
And they attach to t'bird's feet.

788
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:43,470
Say I've got t'bird on me hand. Straps
come down there. Then there's t'swivel.

789
01:11:43,553 --> 01:11:46,055
"Swivel". Write that on the board.

790
01:11:50,435 --> 01:11:55,064
- Then you've got your leash.
- "Leash". On the board.

791
01:11:56,524 --> 01:11:58,777
I fed it on me hand first.

792
01:11:58,860 --> 01:12:01,946
Then, when it got to know me,
I fed it on me glove.

793
01:12:02,530 --> 01:12:07,118
And after a while,
I put it two inches away from its claws.

794
01:12:07,202 --> 01:12:09,913
And, er... Like that, right?

795
01:12:09,996 --> 01:12:14,959
It started to jump for t'meat. When it
started to jump, I could move me hand.

796
01:12:15,043 --> 01:12:18,797
- Hold your hand up, so we can see.
- I could move me hand away, like,

797
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:23,468
to four inches and six inches. And when it
were doin' that, I started it wi't'leash.

798
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:27,347
Do they need water? When you've got
a budgie, you put water in the cage.

799
01:12:27,430 --> 01:12:30,391
Do they need water like that?

800
01:12:30,475 --> 01:12:35,146
Well, it, like, has a bath. It has a bath
right early on int' morning, like.

801
01:12:36,397 --> 01:12:39,359
When do yer feed it?
How many times a day?

802
01:12:39,442 --> 01:12:42,153
To start off with,
three or four, to get it plump.

803
01:12:42,237 --> 01:12:44,489
- You make it sound very exciting.
- It is.

804
01:12:44,572 --> 01:12:47,492
Most exciting thing was
when I flew her free first time.

805
01:12:47,575 --> 01:12:49,869
- Do you wanna hear about that?
- Yes, sir.

806
01:12:49,953 --> 01:12:51,913
Aye. Come on.

807
01:12:51,996 --> 01:12:56,334
Well, I'd been using t'creance
for about a week,

808
01:12:56,417 --> 01:12:59,087
and it had been goin' 30 or 40 yards.

809
01:12:59,170 --> 01:13:02,924
And it says when birds
are goin' 30-40 yards, it says int' book,

810
01:13:03,007 --> 01:13:05,593
it's time that it can start to fly free.

811
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:10,515
Well, I'd been...

812
01:13:10,598 --> 01:13:15,812
I'd been wantin' to fly it free, but I daren't.
I were frightened it'd fly off or somethin'.

813
01:13:15,895 --> 01:13:18,231
This had been goin' on
for four or five days.

814
01:13:18,314 --> 01:13:22,193
And I keep on to missen,
sayin' that "Fly it free next day. "

815
01:13:22,277 --> 01:13:27,449
Anyway, I got right mad wi' missen.
I says "Right, I'm flyin' it free tomorrow. "

816
01:13:27,532 --> 01:13:30,034
Anyway, that night -
that Friday night it were -

817
01:13:30,118 --> 01:13:34,080
I didn't feed her up, so that
she'd be sharp set next mornin'.

818
01:13:34,330 --> 01:13:38,668
And I went to bed that night, Friday night,
and I didn't get an hour's sleep at all.

819
01:13:38,751 --> 01:13:43,465
I were frightened about t'bird,
that she'd fly off or summat like that.

820
01:13:43,548 --> 01:13:46,509
Anyway, when t'mornin' came,
I kept on sayin' to missen

821
01:13:46,593 --> 01:13:49,971
"If she flies off, she flies off,
and it can't be helped. "

822
01:13:50,054 --> 01:13:53,391
So I took t'swivel off
and let her hop onto t'post.

823
01:13:53,475 --> 01:13:58,021
There were nowt stoppin' her, she could
fly off. All that were on her were jesses.

824
01:13:58,104 --> 01:14:01,065
I thought "She must fly off.
She's forced to fly off. "

825
01:14:01,149 --> 01:14:04,694
But she didn't.
She just stood there. I were terrified.

826
01:14:04,778 --> 01:14:09,532
She was stood there, and I walked off
into t'field, and she were lookin' round,

827
01:14:09,616 --> 01:14:14,078
and when I got about 70 yards from her,
in middle of t'field,

828
01:14:14,162 --> 01:14:16,247
I called her.

829
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:20,627
"Kes. Kes. Come on, Kes. Come on, then. "

830
01:14:20,710 --> 01:14:24,047
Nowt happened. So I thought
"I'd better walk back and pick her up. "

831
01:14:24,130 --> 01:14:29,052
So while I were walkin' back,
I saw her flyin'. She came like a bomb!

832
01:14:29,135 --> 01:14:33,556
About a yard off t'floor, like lightning,
head still, and you couldn't hear t'wings.

833
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:37,060
There weren't a sound from t'wings.
And straight onto t'glove. Wham!

834
01:14:37,143 --> 01:14:39,646
And she grabbed me for t'meat.

835
01:14:40,605 --> 01:14:43,483
I were pleased wi' missen,
and I didn't know what to do.

836
01:14:43,566 --> 01:14:47,570
So I thought I better do it again,
just to prove it weren't luck.

837
01:14:47,654 --> 01:14:50,240
So I took her back onto t'post,

838
01:14:51,491 --> 01:14:54,744
and walked up into t'middle of t'field,
and called her again.

839
01:14:54,828 --> 01:14:59,833
And she came just as good as first time,
straight onto t'glove, grabbin' for t'meat.

840
01:14:59,916 --> 01:15:04,003
Well, that were it, sir. I'd trained her, sir,
and that were all I could do.

841
01:15:04,087 --> 01:15:07,632
I think you've done enough.
Well done, Billy. Big hand of applause.

842
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:23,857
- Got owt, Casper?
- Nay.

843
01:15:23,940 --> 01:15:28,820
Tha never has. Tha just cadges. Casper
the Cadger, they ought to call thee.

844
01:15:28,903 --> 01:15:32,240
- I wouldn't give thee owt if I had.
- I'll give thee summat.

845
01:15:32,323 --> 01:15:34,826
What tha goin' for?
Don't tha like company?

846
01:15:34,909 --> 01:15:38,788
They say thi mother does. Tha's
got more uncles than any other kid.

847
01:15:38,872 --> 01:15:40,874
- Shut thi mouth!
- Make me.

848
01:15:40,957 --> 01:15:44,377
- Tha wouldn't say that to our Jud.
- Your Jud's nowt.

849
01:15:44,461 --> 01:15:46,588
What? He's cock of t'estate.

850
01:15:46,671 --> 01:15:50,300
- I know somebody who could do him.
- Who? Thi father?

851
01:15:51,217 --> 01:15:54,053
- He in't even thi brother.
- What is he? Me sister?

852
01:15:54,137 --> 01:15:56,181
They don't even call him Casper.

853
01:15:56,264 --> 01:15:59,893
Course he's me brother!
We live int' same house, don't we?

854
01:16:01,561 --> 01:16:04,063
Get him! Get him!

855
01:16:13,698 --> 01:16:15,784
Fight!

856
01:16:44,646 --> 01:16:47,232
Right, you lot!
Ten seconds, out of my sight!

857
01:16:47,315 --> 01:16:49,692
One! Two! Three!

858
01:16:56,533 --> 01:16:59,119
Right, come here, you two. Come on.

859
01:17:00,829 --> 01:17:03,414
- What's goin' on?
- It was him, sir. He started it.

860
01:17:03,498 --> 01:17:06,626
- He's been chuckin' coal.
- Ah, shut up. Shut up!

861
01:17:07,252 --> 01:17:11,548
It's always the same tale; somebody
else's fault, nobody's to blame.

862
01:17:11,631 --> 01:17:14,801
Look at the mess you're in!
Look at the state you've made!

863
01:17:14,884 --> 01:17:18,138
- Casper, you're not dead yet.
- He will be when I've had him.

864
01:17:18,221 --> 01:17:24,310
Oh, yes! You're a big lad, aren't yer? He's
just about your size, Casper, isn't he? Eh?

865
01:17:24,394 --> 01:17:26,521
Pick on somebody your own size.

866
01:17:26,604 --> 01:17:30,692
What if I rubbed your nose in the coke?
You'd say I was a bully, wouldn't yer?

867
01:17:30,775 --> 01:17:35,363
And you'd be right. Cos I'm bigger
and stronger than you, aren't I? Eh?

868
01:17:35,447 --> 01:17:38,116
- I'll fetch me dad.
- Oh, yes. And I'll fetch mine.

869
01:17:38,199 --> 01:17:40,660
My dad's heavyweight
champion of the world,

870
01:17:40,743 --> 01:17:43,246
so what will your dad do then, eh?

871
01:17:45,874 --> 01:17:50,545
That's what it's like to be bullied.
You don't like it, do yer?

872
01:17:50,628 --> 01:17:54,716
You'll like it a bit less if I ever catch
you at it again. Do you understand it?

873
01:17:54,799 --> 01:17:56,885
Yes, sir.

874
01:17:57,594 --> 01:18:01,097
Get it shovelled up. Come here a minute.
Have you been smoking?

875
01:18:01,181 --> 01:18:03,975
- No, sir.
- You have! I can smell it on your breath.

876
01:18:04,058 --> 01:18:07,187
- No, sir.
- See me afterwards. Get it done. Go on.

877
01:18:20,658 --> 01:18:21,993
What's it all about?

878
01:18:22,076 --> 01:18:26,414
He keeps callin' me names, and sayin'
things about me dad and me mam and...

879
01:18:26,498 --> 01:18:29,042
All right, all right, all right. Calm down.

880
01:18:29,417 --> 01:18:31,836
They all seem to pick on you. Why is it?

881
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:34,214
- Don't know.
- Is it because you're a bad 'un?

882
01:18:34,297 --> 01:18:37,217
Maybe I am sometimes,
but I'm not that bad, sir.

883
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:42,305
I know stacks of other kids that's worse
than me, but they seem to get away wi' it.

884
01:18:44,140 --> 01:18:47,102
Why else do you think, eh?
There must be some reason.

885
01:18:47,185 --> 01:18:49,479
Well, take this mornin', sir.

886
01:18:49,562 --> 01:18:52,607
I came in and just dozed off.
I weren't doin' nowt wrong.

887
01:18:52,690 --> 01:18:57,362
I'd been up since six. I had to do t'papers,
then I had to rush home to look at t'bird,

888
01:18:57,445 --> 01:19:00,615
and then run to school.
You'd be tired, wouldn't yer, sir?

889
01:19:00,698 --> 01:19:02,659
I'd be exhausted.

890
01:19:02,742 --> 01:19:06,704
You shouldn't be caned for that, sir.
And you can't tell Mr Gryce that.

891
01:19:06,788 --> 01:19:11,793
And this little lad, sir. He'd only brought
a letter from a teacher, and he got t'cane.

892
01:19:12,627 --> 01:19:16,256
It's nowt to laugh at, sir.
Afterwards, he was sick as a dog.

893
01:19:17,549 --> 01:19:20,510
And teachers, sir.
They're not bothered about us, sir.

894
01:19:20,593 --> 01:19:24,013
If we're 4C, they think
we're numbskulls, owt like that, sir.

895
01:19:24,097 --> 01:19:28,685
They're always lookin' at their watches,
to see how long there's left of t'lesson.

896
01:19:28,768 --> 01:19:32,730
They're not bothered about us,
and we're not bothered about them.

897
01:19:35,942 --> 01:19:38,278
How are things at home these days?

898
01:19:38,361 --> 01:19:40,780
All right, sir. Usual, I suppose.

899
01:19:40,864 --> 01:19:43,241
- Been in trouble with the police recently?
- No, sir.

900
01:19:43,324 --> 01:19:46,494
Not since I've been
without MacDowall's gang.

901
01:19:46,578 --> 01:19:50,582
You know, they used to go into t'city
and go into t'coffee bars and t'cinema,

902
01:19:50,665 --> 01:19:53,460
but since I've been without them
I've been all right.

903
01:19:53,543 --> 01:19:57,338
- It's all right now, innit?
- But when there's trouble on estate,

904
01:19:57,422 --> 01:20:00,383
all the police come to our house.

905
01:20:00,467 --> 01:20:02,677
Well, I shouldn't worry.

906
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:06,723
In a couple of weeks you'll be starting
your new job, gettin' new friends.

907
01:20:06,806 --> 01:20:11,561
Lookin' forward to that, are yer?
Eh? Have you got a job?

908
01:20:11,644 --> 01:20:14,022
No, sir. I've got to see
t'employment bloke.

909
01:20:14,105 --> 01:20:16,649
- What sort of job do you want?
- Anything'll do me.

910
01:20:16,733 --> 01:20:20,111
But you want something that
you're interested in, don't you?

911
01:20:20,195 --> 01:20:24,073
- I'll take what I've got.
- I thought you wanted to leave school.

912
01:20:24,157 --> 01:20:26,743
- Not bothered.
- Thought you didn't like school.

913
01:20:26,826 --> 01:20:31,372
I don't, but it dun't mean to say I'll like
work. Still, I'll get paid for not likin' it.

914
01:20:31,456 --> 01:20:34,501
- That's one thing.
- I suppose it is.

915
01:20:34,584 --> 01:20:38,588
I might be able to save up and buy
a goshawk. I've been readin' about 'em.

916
01:20:38,671 --> 01:20:41,090
Have yer? When do you fly
this hawk o' yours?

917
01:20:41,174 --> 01:20:42,926
- Dinner times.
- Where?

918
01:20:43,009 --> 01:20:45,595
- Just outside our house, sir.
- Wood Lane?

919
01:20:45,678 --> 01:20:49,307
- Yeah, it is, sir.
- I'll come round, then. If it's OK.

920
01:20:51,476 --> 01:20:54,062
Go on, then. Get yourself cleaned up.

921
01:22:02,046 --> 01:22:06,468
"Five bob double.
Crackpot. Tell Him He's Dead. "

922
01:22:06,551 --> 01:22:08,428
"Jud. "

923
01:22:09,554 --> 01:22:11,639
Bloody hellfire!

924
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:43,102
Kes! Come on, then.

925
01:22:44,729 --> 01:22:46,606
Kes!

926
01:22:47,190 --> 01:22:49,275
Come on, then, Kes.

927
01:22:50,151 --> 01:22:52,028
Come on.

928
01:22:57,867 --> 01:22:59,953
Come on, Kes.

929
01:23:03,998 --> 01:23:06,376
Casper?

930
01:23:06,459 --> 01:23:08,795
Bloody hellfire!

931
01:23:08,878 --> 01:23:12,423
- Hope I'm not too late.
- No. But you'll have to stand over there.

932
01:23:12,507 --> 01:23:15,093
- I'll go by the fence, eh?
- It's all right.

933
01:23:16,135 --> 01:23:19,514
- As long as you keep quiet.
- I'll not say a word.

934
01:23:31,484 --> 01:23:33,570
Come on, Kes!

935
01:23:38,449 --> 01:23:40,535
Come on, Kes!

936
01:23:41,536 --> 01:23:43,413
Kes!

937
01:23:45,957 --> 01:23:47,834
Come on, Kes!

938
01:23:51,588 --> 01:23:53,590
Come on, Kes!

939
01:23:55,967 --> 01:23:57,844
Kes!

940
01:24:21,284 --> 01:24:26,164
Well done, Casper. The most exciting
thing I've ever seen in me life. Great!

941
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:29,792
- Thrill of a lifetime, lad.
- Thank you, sir.

942
01:24:29,876 --> 01:24:32,670
Let's have a look at it.

943
01:24:32,754 --> 01:24:35,340
Isn't it beautifully marked, eh?

944
01:24:37,675 --> 01:24:41,346
Look at the feathers on it.
Oh, it's not gonna eat that, is it?

945
01:24:41,429 --> 01:24:44,265
Yes, sir. This bird's full of vitamins.

946
01:24:46,851 --> 01:24:48,728
Oh, dear!

947
01:24:50,271 --> 01:24:53,483
- Have any more birds before him?
- Stacks. Animals an' all.

948
01:24:53,566 --> 01:24:58,446
A young fox cub once.
Reared it and let it go. A little blinder!

949
01:24:58,530 --> 01:25:01,866
I've had magpies, jackdaws.
Had a young jay once.

950
01:25:04,077 --> 01:25:07,914
- He's your favourite, though.
- Others weren't int' same street.

951
01:25:07,997 --> 01:25:10,500
Come on, then. Come on.

952
01:25:16,798 --> 01:25:19,300
- Come on, sir.
- Oh, dear me!

953
01:25:22,220 --> 01:25:25,139
- Watch that mattress, sir. It's slippy.
- OK.

954
01:25:33,606 --> 01:25:36,109
Look what's left, sir.

955
01:25:37,235 --> 01:25:40,363
Only t'sparrow's leg.
Must have been hungry.

956
01:25:40,446 --> 01:25:42,907
Must have been starvin'.

957
01:25:42,991 --> 01:25:45,910
You hang on here. I'll put him ont' perch.

958
01:25:48,788 --> 01:25:50,665
Come on, then.

959
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:07,682
You know, there's something
weird about it when it's flyin'.

960
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:12,729
- Hawks are t'best fliers there is.
- No, I didn't mean that.

961
01:26:12,812 --> 01:26:17,025
When it's flyin', there's something
about it makes you feel strange.

962
01:26:17,108 --> 01:26:20,737
- Is it cos everythin' goes quiet?
- That's it, aye.

963
01:26:20,820 --> 01:26:25,366
Other folks have noticed that. I know
a farmer who says it's same wi' owls.

964
01:26:25,450 --> 01:26:29,412
You know, when they get
his mice in his yard at night.

965
01:26:29,495 --> 01:26:33,208
When they swoop down, he feels like
pokin' his ears to make 'em pop.

966
01:26:33,291 --> 01:26:35,919
Cos it goes that quiet.

967
01:26:36,002 --> 01:26:39,255
It's as if they're flying
in a pocket of silence.

968
01:26:39,339 --> 01:26:41,883
Have you noticed
how quietly we're speaking?

969
01:26:41,966 --> 01:26:46,721
As if we're frightened to raise our voices,
a bit like shouting in church.

970
01:26:46,804 --> 01:26:49,974
- It's cos they're nervous.
- Oh, no. It's more than that.

971
01:26:50,058 --> 01:26:53,561
It's instinctive. It's a sort of respect.

972
01:26:53,645 --> 01:26:58,316
I know, sir. That's what makes me mad.
When I take her for walks, somebody says

973
01:26:58,399 --> 01:27:01,569
"Look, it's Billy Casper and his pet hawk. "

974
01:27:01,653 --> 01:27:04,447
I could shout at 'em, sir. It in't a pet.

975
01:27:04,531 --> 01:27:07,951
Or if somebody comes up to me
and says "Is it tame?"

976
01:27:08,034 --> 01:27:11,955
Is it heck tame! Hawks can't be tamed.

977
01:27:12,038 --> 01:27:16,918
They're manned. It's wild and it's fierce
and it's not bothered about anybody.

978
01:27:17,001 --> 01:27:20,964
Not bothered about me, right.
That's what makes it great.

979
01:27:21,047 --> 01:27:24,759
A lot of people wouldn't understand.
They like their pets to be fussed.

980
01:27:24,842 --> 01:27:29,013
I'm not bothered about that.
I just want her for her looks and to fly her.

981
01:27:29,097 --> 01:27:32,684
They can keep their talkin' budgies.
They're nowt compared wi' her.

982
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:36,145
You're right, Billy. You're probably right.

983
01:27:36,938 --> 01:27:42,151
D'you know summat, sir? I think she's
done me a favour, lettin' me watch her.

984
01:27:50,577 --> 01:27:53,288
"Same price, 7-1,
number 12, Doorkeeper. "

985
01:27:53,371 --> 01:27:56,291
What's he studyin' there?

986
01:28:01,421 --> 01:28:04,007
- Can I help you, son?
- No, thanks.

987
01:28:06,509 --> 01:28:09,137
Hey, mister, can you
tell me t'prices of these?

988
01:28:09,220 --> 01:28:11,306
What are they?

989
01:28:12,098 --> 01:28:13,975
Crackpot.

990
01:28:14,809 --> 01:28:16,895
Crackpot. 100-6.

991
01:28:18,146 --> 01:28:22,108
Tell Him He's Dead.
I've just been lookin' for this one meself.

992
01:28:22,984 --> 01:28:25,695
Tell Him He's Dead.
Second favourite, 4-1.

993
01:28:25,778 --> 01:28:27,864
100-6, 4-1.

994
01:28:28,615 --> 01:28:30,950
Would you back 'em?

995
01:28:31,034 --> 01:28:35,288
Tell Him He's Dead's a good horse.
Best horse int' race. Top weight.

996
01:28:35,371 --> 01:28:37,790
Don't fancy that one, though.

997
01:28:37,874 --> 01:28:41,961
No form. Hasn't even got a jockey on
here. No, shouldn't bother with that one.

998
01:28:42,045 --> 01:28:44,297
D'yer think they'll win, then?

999
01:28:44,380 --> 01:28:47,217
- How've you got them? Doubled?
- They're our Jud's.

1000
01:28:47,300 --> 01:28:51,429
Oh, he'll be all right if they do,
but I can't see it meself.

1001
01:28:51,512 --> 01:28:53,389
Right. Ta.

1002
01:29:07,195 --> 01:29:11,366
- A bob's worth o' chips, and a fish.
- Serve him, will you, Mary?

1003
01:29:12,367 --> 01:29:15,286
- Yes, love? What do you want?
- Fish 'n' chips.

1004
01:29:17,205 --> 01:29:19,749
Stop kickin'. We only put that on today.

1005
01:29:20,667 --> 01:29:24,629
- Got any scraps, missis?
- Yes, love. I'll put you some on.

1006
01:29:25,630 --> 01:29:30,843
Two shilling, love. I'm gettin' rid of
these chips, Floyd. It's gettin' late now.

1007
01:29:31,636 --> 01:29:33,930
Aye. But don't be goin' mad.

1008
01:29:34,013 --> 01:29:36,099
Sixpence change, love.

1009
01:29:41,604 --> 01:29:46,317
These kids. I don't know,
Mr Glover, they're just all the same.

1010
01:29:50,530 --> 01:29:53,366
- Can I have a quarter o' beef?
- By, those smell good.

1011
01:29:53,449 --> 01:29:55,952
Can I have a quarter o' beef?

1012
01:29:58,204 --> 01:30:00,582
- Tha still got that bird, then?
- Yep.

1013
01:30:08,131 --> 01:30:10,717
- Here, you can have them for nowt.
- For nowt?

1014
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:13,052
- They're only scraps.
- Another chip?

1015
01:30:13,136 --> 01:30:16,431
- No. I'm goin' for me dinner in a minute.
- Right, then. See yer.

1016
01:30:16,514 --> 01:30:18,391
See yer.

1017
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:51,257
Usual difficulty
over concentration. Hm?

1018
01:30:53,426 --> 01:30:55,386
Three fives are 15, eh?

1019
01:30:55,470 --> 01:30:59,390
We write 15 one, five.
You write five, one.

1020
01:31:02,977 --> 01:31:06,189
Oi, tha fuckin' twat!

1021
01:31:07,273 --> 01:31:11,945
Isn't that that illustrious
brother of yours, Casper?

1022
01:31:12,028 --> 01:31:17,408
Shouldn't have thought he was the type to
have paid a visit to his old school again.

1023
01:31:18,576 --> 01:31:22,163
- What's the matter? Don't you feel well?
- No, sir.

1024
01:31:22,247 --> 01:31:26,251
- Do you want to go for a drink of water?
- No, sir.

1025
01:31:26,334 --> 01:31:29,629
- Well, open the window.
- I'm all right, sir.

1026
01:31:30,755 --> 01:31:32,590
Please yourself.

1027
01:31:35,260 --> 01:31:39,556
Right, now just pass your books forward,
will you? To the front.

1028
01:31:39,639 --> 01:31:43,268
Front person on each row,
bring them to my desk, will you?

1029
01:32:02,120 --> 01:32:04,622
What's the matter, Casper?
Lost something?

1030
01:32:04,706 --> 01:32:07,292
- Me, sir? No, sir.
- On your way, then.

1031
01:32:36,863 --> 01:32:41,284
- What's up with thee, Jud?
- It's that little bastard, our Billy.

1032
01:32:41,367 --> 01:32:46,581
I left him with a bet for t'horses and he's
kept t'stinkin' money. I'll kill the little git!

1033
01:32:54,297 --> 01:32:56,925
- What are you playing at?
- Goin' to t'toilet, sir.

1034
01:32:57,008 --> 01:32:58,760
Hurry up, then.

1035
01:33:20,573 --> 01:33:22,700
- I'm on 'ere!
- Seen our Billy?

1036
01:33:22,784 --> 01:33:24,994
- Aye. He's here wi' me.
- Tryin' to be funny?

1037
01:33:25,078 --> 01:33:28,790
Cos I'll stick thi head down there,
old pal, and flush it.

1038
01:33:28,873 --> 01:33:31,834
- I asked if tha'd seen him.
- I wouldn't tell thee if I had.

1039
01:33:31,918 --> 01:33:34,546
- Look, I'm warnin' yer!
- Ow!

1040
01:35:31,788 --> 01:35:34,541
'Ey up, Tibbut, has tha seen our Jud?

1041
01:35:34,624 --> 01:35:37,544
- They've been lookin' all over for thee.
- Who has?

1042
01:35:37,627 --> 01:35:39,587
- Gryce Pudding.
- What for?

1043
01:35:39,671 --> 01:35:42,590
Youth Employment.
Tha should have gone for t'interview.

1044
01:35:42,674 --> 01:35:46,386
- Has tha seen our Jud?
- Yeah. He wanted to know where tha was.

1045
01:35:49,639 --> 01:35:52,225
- Where the devil have you been?
- Nowhere, sir.

1046
01:35:52,308 --> 01:35:54,519
Nowhere?
Who are you, the Invisible Man?

1047
01:35:54,602 --> 01:35:56,896
I felt sick, sir, so I went to t'toilets.

1048
01:35:56,980 --> 01:36:00,984
What happened? Did you drop down it?
I've had prefects looking for you!

1049
01:36:01,067 --> 01:36:04,362
- I went out for a breath of fresh air.
- Where are you going now?

1050
01:36:04,445 --> 01:36:08,366
- Employment officer.
- For your interview? Get off, then, lad!

1051
01:36:08,449 --> 01:36:10,535
And God help your future employer!

1052
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:04,589
- Sit up, Peter.
- I'm sat up.

1053
01:37:05,715 --> 01:37:08,468
And don't be like a dummy
when you get in there.

1054
01:37:08,551 --> 01:37:12,597
Just tell him you're after a good job,
in an office or something like that.

1055
01:37:12,680 --> 01:37:15,266
I'm not working in no office!

1056
01:37:15,350 --> 01:37:20,063
- What are you after? A job on the bins?
- Can't you shut up?

1057
01:37:20,146 --> 01:37:21,981
- Sit up.
- I'm sat up.

1058
01:37:22,065 --> 01:37:25,276
- And straighten your tie.
- Tha's naggin'.

1059
01:37:26,110 --> 01:37:28,613
Somebody's got to nag.

1060
01:37:35,161 --> 01:37:37,247
Is it yer mam?

1061
01:37:37,914 --> 01:37:40,750
- What job are tha after?
- Owt'll do me.

1062
01:37:40,833 --> 01:37:42,877
- It certainly won't.
- It will.

1063
01:37:42,961 --> 01:37:45,046
- It won't.
- Right. Thank you.

1064
01:37:45,129 --> 01:37:47,340
Will you send the next one in?

1065
01:37:47,423 --> 01:37:50,552
- Pardon?
- Will you send the next one in, please?

1066
01:37:54,430 --> 01:37:57,267
- Isn't it your turn to go in?
- Suppose so.

1067
01:37:57,892 --> 01:37:59,978
Well, go on, then.

1068
01:38:16,744 --> 01:38:19,664
Get out! Knock and wait.

1069
01:38:24,460 --> 01:38:26,629
Come in.

1070
01:38:28,923 --> 01:38:31,509
Well, come in, lad, if you're coming.

1071
01:38:34,178 --> 01:38:37,140
- Sit down, Walker.
- I'm not Walker, sir.

1072
01:38:37,223 --> 01:38:40,560
Who are you, then? On my list
it should be Gerald Walker next.

1073
01:38:40,643 --> 01:38:43,146
Oliver, Stenton, then Walker.

1074
01:38:43,229 --> 01:38:45,565
- I'm Casper.
- Casper.

1075
01:38:45,648 --> 01:38:49,819
Oh, sit down, Casper. I should
have seen you earlier, shouldn't I?

1076
01:38:51,696 --> 01:38:55,325
Well, then, Casper,
what kind of job had you got in mind?

1077
01:38:59,245 --> 01:39:00,997
Well?

1078
01:39:01,080 --> 01:39:03,666
I don't know, sir.
I haven't thought about it.

1079
01:39:03,750 --> 01:39:08,046
You should be thinking about it. You want
to start off on the right foot, don't you?

1080
01:39:12,592 --> 01:39:15,178
Right, then.
Would you like to work in an office?

1081
01:39:15,261 --> 01:39:19,432
- Or would you prefer manual work?
- What's manual work?

1082
01:39:19,515 --> 01:39:23,686
It means working with your hands. Things
like farming, engineering, plumbing.

1083
01:39:23,770 --> 01:39:27,398
Things like that,
as opposed to penpushing jobs.

1084
01:39:27,482 --> 01:39:31,444
I'd be all right in an office.
I have a job to read and write.

1085
01:39:34,364 --> 01:39:36,241
"Manual".

1086
01:39:37,617 --> 01:39:43,164
Tell me, Casper, have you ever thought
about entering a trade as an apprentice?

1087
01:39:43,248 --> 01:39:47,293
You know, as an electrician
or a bricklayer or something like that.

1088
01:39:47,377 --> 01:39:52,382
Of course, the money's not too good
while you're serving your apprenticeship,

1089
01:39:52,465 --> 01:39:56,469
but you'll always have a trade
at your fingertips, won't you?

1090
01:39:56,553 --> 01:39:58,888
Well, what do you think about it?

1091
01:39:58,972 --> 01:40:03,768
As you've said, you feel better working
with your hands. Perhaps this is the best.

1092
01:40:03,852 --> 01:40:08,857
Of course, you'd have to go to technical
college and study for examinations.

1093
01:40:08,940 --> 01:40:12,610
Some lads do it. Some do it for years,
two or three nights a week,

1094
01:40:12,694 --> 01:40:15,697
right from leaving school
right up to mid-twenties,

1095
01:40:15,780 --> 01:40:19,409
when they take their Higher National,
or even degrees.

1096
01:40:20,493 --> 01:40:22,996
I say, lad. Are you listening to me?

1097
01:40:23,079 --> 01:40:25,540
- Yeah.
- You don't look as though you are.

1098
01:40:25,623 --> 01:40:29,252
I've other lads to see
before four o'clock, you know.

1099
01:40:30,295 --> 01:40:32,505
If nothing I've mentioned appeals to you,

1100
01:40:32,589 --> 01:40:36,092
and if you can stand a hard day's work
and don't mind getting dirty,

1101
01:40:36,175 --> 01:40:39,762
- there are good opportunities in mining.
- I'm not goin' down t'pit.

1102
01:40:39,846 --> 01:40:44,350
Don't be put off by what you've heard.
Conditions have improved tremendously.

1103
01:40:44,434 --> 01:40:47,061
I wouldn't be seen dead down t'pit.

1104
01:40:47,145 --> 01:40:50,190
What about hobbies?
What hobbies have you got?

1105
01:40:50,273 --> 01:40:55,278
Do you like gardening, or constructing
Meccano sets, or anything like that?

1106
01:40:56,196 --> 01:40:59,282
- Don't you have any hobbies at all?
- Can I go now?

1107
01:40:59,365 --> 01:41:03,536
What's wrong with you, lad?
Sit down. Sit down, I haven't finished yet.

1108
01:41:05,121 --> 01:41:08,666
I've met some lads in my time,
but I've never met one like you.

1109
01:41:08,750 --> 01:41:13,463
Half the time you're like a cat on hot
bricks, the other half you're not listening.

1110
01:41:13,546 --> 01:41:15,465
Here. Take this form.

1111
01:41:15,548 --> 01:41:18,927
It gives you information about
leaving school and starting work.

1112
01:41:19,010 --> 01:41:23,014
Things like pensions, superannuation,
national insurance, wages.

1113
01:41:23,097 --> 01:41:27,310
At the back, there's a detachable form.
When you want your cards, fill it in...

1114
01:41:27,393 --> 01:41:29,521
Come back, lad. I haven't finished yet.

1115
01:41:29,604 --> 01:41:32,857
When you want your cards,
fill in that form, send it in. Got that?

1116
01:41:32,941 --> 01:41:35,443
- Yeah.
- Don't forget. And listen, Casper.

1117
01:41:35,527 --> 01:41:38,613
If you do have trouble getting fixed up,
come in and see me.

1118
01:41:38,696 --> 01:41:40,865
- Yeah.
- Send the next boy in.

1119
01:42:00,843 --> 01:42:02,804
Kes!

1120
01:42:06,391 --> 01:42:08,268
Kes!

1121
01:42:10,103 --> 01:42:11,980
Kes!

1122
01:42:17,569 --> 01:42:19,445
Kes!

1123
01:42:21,823 --> 01:42:23,700
Kes!

1124
01:42:34,168 --> 01:42:36,045
Jud?

1125
01:42:37,797 --> 01:42:40,300
Jud?! Mother?!

1126
01:42:44,095 --> 01:42:47,223
- Missis, have you seen our Jud?
- I haven't, love. Sorry.

1127
01:42:53,563 --> 01:42:55,982
- Have you seen our Jud?
- Course I've seen him.

1128
01:42:56,065 --> 01:42:59,444
- Doesn't look as though you've seen him.
- You've seen him, then?

1129
01:42:59,527 --> 01:43:04,699
Course I've seen him. Come in here
playin' hell. Goin' to pull t'counter down.

1130
01:43:04,782 --> 01:43:07,869
I had to fetch Eric Clough
to prove tha hadn't put t'bet on.

1131
01:43:07,952 --> 01:43:10,997
- They won, then, did they?
- Both of 'em. 100-6 and 4-1.

1132
01:43:11,080 --> 01:43:14,792
- He'd have won a tenner, I tell thee that.
- Bloody hell.

1133
01:43:14,876 --> 01:43:16,753
Kes!

1134
01:43:20,256 --> 01:43:22,342
Come on, Kes!

1135
01:43:23,051 --> 01:43:25,136
Come on, lass!

1136
01:43:37,690 --> 01:43:39,567
Kes!

1137
01:43:42,529 --> 01:43:44,405
Kes!

1138
01:44:04,884 --> 01:44:06,970
Come on, Kes!

1139
01:44:51,139 --> 01:44:53,016
Kes!

1140
01:45:08,031 --> 01:45:09,908
Kes!

1141
01:45:36,976 --> 01:45:41,523
- Where is it? What's tha done wi' it?
- Where've you been? Your tea's cold.

1142
01:45:41,606 --> 01:45:44,108
I said, where is it?

1143
01:45:45,944 --> 01:45:48,655
- What's tha starin' at?
- Thee, tha little pig!

1144
01:45:48,738 --> 01:45:50,657
Don't call me a little pig!

1145
01:45:50,740 --> 01:45:53,576
Hey! Hey!

1146
01:45:53,660 --> 01:45:56,412
Jud, what's all t'bloody
pushin' and shovin'?

1147
01:45:56,496 --> 01:46:00,375
- Ask him. He knows.
- Tha'd have known if I'd got hold o' thee.

1148
01:46:00,458 --> 01:46:02,377
- Oh, get lost!
- Knows what?

1149
01:46:02,460 --> 01:46:04,963
What's goin' off? What's up wi' him?

1150
01:46:05,046 --> 01:46:08,591
If he'd have put that bet on,
there wouldn't have been none of this.

1151
01:46:08,675 --> 01:46:11,344
- He's put it on, hasn't he?
- Has he bloody hell!

1152
01:46:11,427 --> 01:46:15,515
- I told him to. I asked you not to forget.
- He didn't forget. He spent t'money!

1153
01:46:15,598 --> 01:46:17,183
How d'you know?

1154
01:46:17,267 --> 01:46:20,228
What you gettin' so upset for?
Have they won?

1155
01:46:20,311 --> 01:46:24,691
Have they won?! I'd have 16 quid
if he'd kept his thieving hands to hisself.

1156
01:46:24,774 --> 01:46:27,610
- Look what you've done.
- Should have done it thissen.

1157
01:46:27,694 --> 01:46:30,947
- I could have a week off work for that!
- Get lost, you big pig!

1158
01:46:31,030 --> 01:46:33,449
Hey! Well, what's he upset for?

1159
01:46:33,533 --> 01:46:36,619
Because he's killed me hawk instead,
that's why.

1160
01:46:36,703 --> 01:46:40,415
- He never has.
- I know he has. Cos he couldn't catch me.

1161
01:46:40,498 --> 01:46:45,712
- Jud! You have not killed this kid's hawk!
- So I have. What yer gonna do about it?

1162
01:46:45,795 --> 01:46:47,881
Killing yerself, that's what you want!

1163
01:46:47,964 --> 01:46:50,884
It were its own fault.
I were only gonna let it go.

1164
01:46:50,967 --> 01:46:53,720
Kept lashin' at me wi't'claws.
I had to kill it.

1165
01:46:53,803 --> 01:46:56,723
