我们给他起名叫罗格吧

你那蛋蛋掉出来的时候
When your testicles fell off,

是带了多少雌性激素啊

13
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:29,120
还是你太阴虚了

你就是在气我吧

30
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,410
在万圣节打扮成对方的模样

但她却不会穿成你的样子

但你们还是会去万圣节派对

33
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,130
那我实在是太遗憾了

34
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,610
因为我们不是这样的

141
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,320
如果把这些树换成高楼大厦
If these trees were skyscrapers,

142
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,180
-你就舒服多了吧  -是啊
- you'd feel very comfortable. - Yeah.

143
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,880
那就像在家里一样舒服  不幸的是
I'd be right at home. Unfortunately,

144
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,730
它们就是树
they're actual trees.

145
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,640
-你最棒了  -我喜欢你的帽子
- You're the best. - I love the hat!

146
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,730
抱歉  那是太阳能手机充电器吗
I'm sorry, is that a solar cell phone charger?

147
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:56,010
是啊  没有它的话我撑不过两天
Yeah, I can't go more than two days without it.

148
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,240
等等  你也...讨厌野营吗
Okay, hold on. Do you... do you hate camping, too?

149
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,620
你在开玩笑吗  我恨死野营了
Are you kidding me? I absolutely hate camping.

150
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,380
那我们还待在这里干嘛
Then why are we here?

151
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,890
因为我没有话语权  我从来没有过
Because I didn't get a say. I never get a say.

152
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,280
不管我想做什么  他们鸟都不鸟我
Whenever I want to do something, they don't give a hoot.

153
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,520
猜猜看谁拿到了去陶瓷研讨会的入场券
Guess who just got free passes to a pottery seminar.

154
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,190
-快出去吧  -温斯顿
- Get out of here. - Winston!

155
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:16,100
我们本来可以做最棒的马克杯的
We could've made the craziest mugs, man.

156
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,320
-尼克  -在
- Hey, Nick? - Yeah.

157
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,440
这里只有啤酒
There's just beer in here.

158
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,970
这应该能够我们喝上几个小时的
That should last us for the first few hours, actually.

159
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,270
食物在哪儿
Where's the food?

160
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,740
那些我做的派在哪儿
Where... where are all the pies I made?

161
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,240
别担心  杰茜
Look, don't worry, Jess.

162
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:31,070
因为食物就在...就在这里
'Cause the food is... right here.

163
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,570
抱歉  我不太懂那个手势是什么意思
I'm... sorry. I don't understand that gesture.

164
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:37,330
我们要出去打猎觅食
We're gonna be hunting and foraging for our dinner,

165
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,760
就像印第安人和清教徒那样
just like the Indians and the Pilgrims.

166
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,750
但你带了啤酒来
But you brought beer.

167
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,220
你没法觅到啤酒的  这是必需品
You can't forage for beer. And that's a necessity.

168
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:49,740
这就是感恩节晚餐吗
So this is Thanksgiving meal?

169
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,470
96罐热啤酒
96 warm beers?

170
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:52,480
我们可以这样
We can do this.

171
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,270
伙计们  我们变得很软弱
Guys, we've gotten soft!

172
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,790
就因为抗生素和止疼膏
With our antibiotics and our sports creams.

173
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,700
你们觉得乔治・华盛顿会养宠物猫吗
Do you think George Washington had a pet cat?

174
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,920
-是啊  -不  他不会
- Yeah. - No. He didn't.

175
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,590
-他捕猎猫  -你说啥
- He hunted them. - What?

176
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:05,570
他从它们身上榨取了奶和黄油
And he made milk and butter out of their spoils.

177
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:06,410
这太可怕了
That's terrible.

178
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:07,730
你是说乔治・华盛顿给他的猫挤奶吗
So you're saying George Washington milked his cat?

179
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,550
-听起来太不正常了  -完全没有
- Nothing is sounding accurate right now. - Not at all.

180
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,350
你从哪儿读到这个的
Where'd you read this?

181
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,780
我没说这很简单
I'm not saying it's gonna be easy.

182
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,950
这很困难
It's gonna be hard.

183
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,120
但我们一定能完成的
But we will emerge out of this

184
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:17,560
我们会成为更好的朋友  成为一个部落
better friends and a tribe.

185
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,800
我参加
I'm on board.

186
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,450
返璞归真嘛
Going old-school.

187
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,280
上啊  杀啊  捕猎啊  上啊
Men! Killing! Hunting! Men!

188
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,830
上啊  上啊  上啊  上啊
Men! Men! Men! Men!

189
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,110
我的牛仔帽  我的牛仔...
Oh, my cowman's... my cowman...

190
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,550
我的牛仔帽  我的牛仔帽
my cowman's hat, my cowman's hat.

191
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:28,890
伙计们  听我说
Guys, look,

192
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,940
我和这里的所有人一样有血性
I'm as much a man as anybody here,

193
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,930
但这个计划简直是太挫了
but this plan is straight-up dookie.

194
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,660
我需要糖果  我需要游行
I need my sweets and I need my parade.

195
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,420
你知道吗  我也不参加了
Yeah, you know what? I'm out, too.

196
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:39,200
同志们  同志们  听我说
Guys, guys, guys. Look.

197
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,780
我们团圆了
We're together.

198
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,630
我们是一家人
We're a family.

199
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,770
这是感恩节啊
It's Thanksgiving.

200
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,660
我保证尼克是计划好了的  对吧
And I'm sure Nick has a plan. Right?

201
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,810
-我当然有计划了  -太好了
- Oh, yeah. I've got a plan. - Great.

202
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,430
-你有计划  -那个人有计划
- You got a plan? - The man's got a plan.

203
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:51,330
这些野外指南详细的介绍了
These wilderness guides right here detail what plants

204
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,360
什么植物能吃  什么陷阱能造
are safe for eating and what traps we can build.

205
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,090
不幸的是  我没钱了
Unfortunately, I ran out of money,

206
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,600
所以我没法打印
so I couldn't print out the chapters

207
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,880
开膛破肚和剥皮的内容  不过
on gutting and skinning, but...

208
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,080
等我们到了那一步再说吧
we'll worry about that when we get there.

209
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,360
按清教徒的规矩
Pilgrim rules.

210
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,420
男人打猎
Men, hunters!

211
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,940
女人搜集食材
Women, foragers.

212
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,830
我才不打猎  要打我也只打
I'm not hunting. The only hunt I want

213
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,070
邦妮或者海伦
is Bonnie or Helen.

214
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:08,070
Bonnie Hunt和Helen Hunt是两个女明星
虽然都姓Hunt  但没有亲戚关系

215
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,170
你懂的  教练
You know what I'm talking about, Coach.

216
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,090
不懂
What?

217
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,360
尼克
Nick.

218
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,520
太完美了  回归自然的原始人
This is perfect. Primal man in nature.

219
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,310
围捕猎物  现在谁才像个娘们  教练
Stalking prey. Who's basically the lady now, Coach?

220
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:22,150
这二十分钟我都见到这棵树六次了
I've seen that tree six times in the past 20 minutes.

221
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,390
我们肯定在兜圈子
We're definitely moving in a small circle.

222
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,660
那我就这样  我往这边开出一条小路
Here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna clear a path this way.

223
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,810
我们一路向北
We will travel northbound, I believe.

224
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:29,940
那不是北边  是南边
That's not north, that's south.

225
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,190
南边吗  那我们就一路向南
That is south? Then let's travel southbound.

226
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:33,820
我来开路  要是里面有什么
I'm gonna clear a path. If something's in there

227
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,810
而你被它伤到的话  我会帮你快速了断的
and you get injured, I promise you I will kill you fast.

228
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:40,030
粪便  粪便
Scat! Scat.

229
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:47,950
-这附近有只动物  -施密特  那是颗葡萄干
- There's an animal nearby. - Hey, Schmidt, that's a raisin, man.

230
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,950
这不是葡萄干  这就是动物粪便
That's not a raisin. This is scat.

231
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,580
好吧
Okay.

232
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,060
这肯定是粪便
That's poop for sure.

233
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,560
我是对的  打脸哦  尼克
I was right. In your face, Nick.

234
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,950
-打脸哦  尼克  -所以呢
- In your face, Nick. - How so?

235
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,090
不知道  他把  把一颗粪便吃了
I don't know, he put a... put a turd in his mouth.

236
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,230
-所以那就打我脸了  真是  -没错
- And that's in my face? So that's... - Yeah.

237
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,520
我觉得我们还没到吃屎的地步  施密特
I don't think we should start eating poo yet, Schmidt.

238
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:06,100
尽管等着吧
Let's wait on that.

239
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,430
你要不要吃点土清清口
You want to chase that with some dirt?

240
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,860
有人有口香糖吗
Does anyone have any gum?

241
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,600
没有
No.

242
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,140
我一开始就不想这样的
Not that I wanted any in the first place.

243
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,680
那洞也太大了  尼克
That's a mighty big hole there, Nick.

244
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,830
你想逮个大冰箱么
You trying to catch a refrigerator?

245
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,880
这是个熊洞
It's a bear hole.

246
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:21,110
熊掉进去  然后其他东西掉进去
Bear falls in, other stuff falls in.

247
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,210
我们就拿熊不要的
We take what the bear doesn't want.

248
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,450
-有道理  -经典的人熊团队
- Makes sense. - Classic human/bear team-up.

249
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:25,960
我是芝加哥人  我只能做到这样了
I'm from Chicago. It's the best I can do.

250
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,300
是啊  熊都喜欢跟你分享食物
Yeah, bears love to share.

251
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,310
等那只熊掉进洞里的时候
What are you planning on doing with

252
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,510
你打算怎么做
that bear when he falls into the hole?

253
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,220
伙计  我已经尽力了
Dude, I'm trying the best that I can!

254
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,340
我们没有吃的
We have no food.

255
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,270
我来告诉你吧  尼克
Let me explain something to you, Nick.

256
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,410
在做陷阱的时候
When you're building a trap,

257
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:36,870
得为你的猎物一一量身定制
you want to customize it to your prey.

258
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,300
所以呢  如果我想抓
So, I don't know, if I was

259
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,920
比如说  松鼠的话
trying to catch, say a squirrel,

260
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,880
我会像松鼠一样思考
I'd want to think like a squirrel.

261
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,890
容我用我造的这个陷阱来做演示
Allow me to demonstrate with this trap that I built.

262
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,310
你怎么能像松鼠一样思考呢
How do you get into the mindset of a squirrel?

263
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,450
我是只松鼠  对吧
I'm a squirrel... right?

264
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,980
-学得真像  -看这里
- You do that really well. - Look at this!

265
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,270
这儿有些坚果
Oh, there's some nuts here.

266
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,350
看这些可爱的小坚果
Look at all these little nuts.

267
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,820
你最好别那么做
You might not want to do that.

268
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,960
我要是想学纺纱的话
If I needed your advice on how to lead a spinning class,

269
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,130
我会请教你的  但这可是我的专业领域
I'd ask you, but this is my territory.

270
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,670
-我的肩胛骨  -兄弟  你没事吧
- My scapula! - Dude, are you all right?

271
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,900
快弄开
Aah! Aah, get it off! Aah!

272
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:06,740
快
Get it!

273
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,960
起来  深呼吸
Get up. Keep breathing, man.

274
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,920
我不是故意要笑的
I don't mean to be laughing,

275
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,940
-你还好吗  -我得给你绑个绷带
- but are you okay? - I’m gonna make you a sling.

276
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:12,660
你要干嘛
You're gonna make me a what?

277
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,520
-你根本不会  -绷带
- You don't know how to do that. - A sling.

278
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,760
我当然会绑
Of course I do.

279
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,150
你在干嘛
What...?What are you doing?

280
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,440
我当年可是鹰级童子军[最高级童子军]
I was an Eagle Scout.

281
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,400
你在说什么呢  你是鹰级童子军
What are you talking about, you were an Eagle Scout?

282
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,960
-你看吧  -确实还不错
- Look. - That's actually really good.

283
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,040
很抱歉  伙计  你想做野营第一人
I'm sorry, dude. You wanted to be the best at camping.

284
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,360
你又对你那顶帽子那么兴奋
You were so excited about your hat.

285
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,010
我并不想干预
I didn't want to get in the way of that.

286
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,760
再加上整个关于希希的事
Plus with the whole Cece thing or whatever.

287
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,350
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

288
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,240
我的第一是你让出来的吗
You're gonna let me be the best camper.

289
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,320
-我就是野营第一人  -是啊
- I am the best camper! - Yeah.

290
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,060
我觉得这是菊苣
I think this is chicory.

291
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,750
书上说它的根可以吃
It says you can eat the root.

292
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,430
这也可能是茉莉
Or it's jasmine.

293
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,450
吃了会死的
Which will kill you.

294
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,180
你们怎么看
Hmm. What do you guys think?

295
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,480
-肯定没事的  -尽管吃吧
- I’m sure it's fine. - Yeah, just eat it.

296
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,330
树莓
Hey, raspberries!

297
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,380
这儿
There... Ow!

298
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:54,690
这儿有很多树莓
There are a lot of brambles in here.

299
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:56,160
离这儿不远有家乡村小店
There's a country store not far from here.

300
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,340
三星半  评论说
Three and a half stars. The reviews say,

301
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,010
"凑活能吃不过很脏"
"It's functional and dusty."

302
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:01,280
我觉得还行
Sounds good to me.

303
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,420
棒极了  谁来帮帮我
This is so fun. Who wants to help?

304
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,370
这计划显然是最糟糕的
This plan is officially the worst.

305
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,940
我们要饿死了
We are starving.

306
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,000
尽管承认吧  你也不想这么做
Just admit, you don't want to do this, either.

307
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:10,780
听好了
Okay, listen up.

308
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,210
只能买森林里能找到的东西  好吗
Only stuff we can find in the forest, right?

309
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,210
看那鱼
Look at that fish.

310
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:18,490
棒极了
It's perfect.

311
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:19,960
-不是吧  -我得把它抓来
- What? Oh, - I’m gonna grab it.

312
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,860
饿死了  终于要开餐了  弟兄们
I'm so hungry. Now we get to eat, boys.

313
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,390
哥们  那看起来像是死的
Dude, that looks dead.

314
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,740
伙计们  积极一点儿
Guys, stop being negative right now.

315
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,540
一面翻上来表示它已经死了
Laying on its side means it's dead.

316
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,740
我才不想进到水里呢  哥们
I wouldn't get in that water, man.

317
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,430
你会得贾第虫病的
You're gonna get beaver fever.

318
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,570
现在谁是孬种啊  教练
Where are my testicles now, Coach?

319
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:33,720
等他逮到那个小可怜时
When he catches that little critter,

320
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,430
我会给你表演怎么给它刮鳞
I'm gonna show you how to scale it.

321
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:37,630
疼吗
That hurts?

322
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,450
当然疼了
Yeah, it hurts!

323
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:39,940
一块石头掉在了我的...
A boulder fell on my...

324
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,800
你这么做是因为我取笑你的邀请吗
Is all this 'cause I teased you about the invite?

325
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,360
是的  义无反顾
Yes, it is! No regrets!

326
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,420
拜托  尼克
Aw! Aw, come on, Nick.

327
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,150
-成功了  -别闹了
- Yes! - Quit it.

328
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,330
你们可能是对的  它可能是死的
You guys might be right! It might be dead!

329
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,070
事实上  确实是死鱼
In fact, it was dead!

330
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,870
闻着还挺...新鲜
Smells fresh... enough!

331
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,360
拜托  温斯顿
Oh, come on, Winston, what?

332
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,820
你刚做完指甲还是怎么着  把苹果弄脏
You just get your nails done? Get the apple dirty!

333
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,960
蹭点儿灰尘上去
Grind some dirt in it, grind some dirt in it.

334
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,160
-我的神啊  好饿  -嗨
- God, I'm so hungry! - Hey, hey!

335
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,600
看男人们带回来了什么
Hey. Look what the men brought.

336
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,640
-哎呦  不错呦  -计划凑效了
- Oh, hey! Hey, hey! - The plan worked.

337
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,870
他看起来像个斗士
Hey, he looks like a fighter.

338
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,790
他确实算是  某种程度上说
He really was, kind of.

339
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,930
-神啊  -哇
- Oh, my God! - Wow.

340
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:16,830
-不算什么啦  -哇
- I mean, well... - Whoa.

341
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:19,240
-像自助餐一样  -你们干得很好
- Like a smorgasbord. - You guys did great.

342
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,150
-是啊  -对
- Yeah, we did. - Yep.

343
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,230
你们从哪弄的腰果
Where'd you get the cashews?

344
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,390
-灌木丛上  -对
- Um, on a bush. - Yeah.

345
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,030
甜菜呢
How about the beets?

346
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,370
-也是灌木上的  -没错
- Also a bush. - That's right.

347
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:28,870
好吧
Yeah.

348
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,160
那牛油果呢
The avocado?

349
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,610
-还是灌木上  -是的
- Also on a bush. - That's right.

350
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,980
看看我们  离家远行
Well, look at us. Living off the land,

351
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,460
自力更生
fending for ourselves.

352
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,550
我们有鱼还有水果
We got fish and fruits,

353
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,670
还有这个可能是我这辈子
and this is probably gonna be the most delicious apple

354
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,660
吃过的最好吃的苹果
I've ever eaten in my life.

355
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:49,840
为什么是俄勒冈州生产
"Product of Oregon"?

356
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,530
我们刚才居然走到俄勒冈州了
We walked to Oregon?

357
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:53,480
-啥  -怎么可能
- What? - What?

358
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,820
-难怪抽筋呢  -是啊  -这地方...
- That's why this cramp... - Yeah... - This place...

359
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,440
拜托  你们真以为我们三个是笨蛋吗
Come on, you think the three of us are true dumb-asses?

360
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,070
我们不是  从开始我就差不多知道了
We're not. I kind of knew from the beginning.

361
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,920
你们不可能做到的
I mean, there's no way.

362
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,890
这些都是你们从商店买的吧
You just went to a store and got all this?

363
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:03,000
我觉得是
I think so.

364
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:05,370
我觉得这些都是他们买来的
I think they definitely bought everything from the store.

365
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:06,770
我想要的就是
The one thing I wanted

366
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:09,890
大家一起坐下来吃顿晚饭
was for us all to sit down together and have dinner,

367
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,780
没有东西吃怎么行
and you can't do that without dinner.

368
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,020
我们有东西吃
We have dinner.

369
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,890
那鱼看起来有点像河马肉
That fish kind of looks like hippo meat.

370
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:15,980
哥们  别这样
Come on, man.

371
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:16,500
让我们坐下来
Let's just sit down

372
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,310
品尝美味的扁桃仁吧
and eat some delicious almonds.

373
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:19,450
-好好享受  -是啊
- And enjoy ourselves. - Yes.

374
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,570
一起好好过一个感恩节
And have a really nice Thanksgiving together.

375
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:22,650
拜托了  尼克  开吃吧
Come on, Nick, let's eat.

376
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:23,580
别闹了  哥们  开吃吧
Come on, man, let's eat.

377
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:26,330
我有种第一个感恩节时人们的感觉
I feel like how they must've felt on the first Thanksgiving.

378
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:27,870
被背叛了
Betrayed.

379
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,770
-尼克  -啥
- Nick - What?

380
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,350
你们过你们的吧
Happy Thanksgiving.

381
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,690
-拜托  尼克  -别这样
- Oh, come on. Nick, come on! - Don't do this.

382
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:35,370
得告诉你一下  首个感恩节挺和谐的
FYI, the first Thanksgiving was the good one.

383
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:36,850
别闹了  尼克
Come on, Nick!

384
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,870
这些牛油果很贵的
These avocados were expensive!

385
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,800
开吃
Here we go.

386
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,150
好香啊
It smells so good.

387
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:42,990
我都等不及了
I can't wait till it's ready.

388
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,650
会撑死我的
I'm gonna be so stuffed.

389
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,670
鱼眼睛掉了
The eyeball fell off.

390
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:49,950
你就知道它有多鲜美了
That's how you know it's good.

391
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,850
当烤好的时候它们就会掉出来
They got to pop out when it's ready, I think.

392
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,400
现在终于可以摊牌了
Now that the cards are finally on the table,

393
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,700
我们知道谁才是真正的露营大师了
I guess we can see who the true camp master really is.

394
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,820
-答案就是我  -谁先生好火谁就赢
- The answer's me. - First one to make a flame wins.

395
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,650
开动吧
Let's do this.

396
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,090
看好了
Now, check this out.

397
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,330
哥教你怎么生火
This is how you make a flame.

398
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,360
你那两块石头  这么互相敲
You go with two rocks. One against the other.

399
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,630
产生摩擦
You create friction.

400
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,220
-搞定了  -啥
- I'm done. - What?

401
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,840
-搞定了  -那算不上火苗  快灭了都
- I'm done. - Well, that's barely a flame, it's going out.

402
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,390
我的个亲娘啊  你是谁  巫师吗
Whoa! Well, goodness gracious! What are you? A sorcerer?

403
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,850
妈的
Damn it!

404
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:25,260
山顶洞人
Hey, mountain man.

405
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,570
你想过来和我们一起吃些脏的蔬菜吗
You want to come eat some dirty vegetables with us?

406
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,100
我应该猜到那甜菜不是野生的
I should've known those beets weren't from nature.

407
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,490
野生的长不出紫色
Nothing purple grows in nature.

408
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,570
听着  我们没有挺过来  好吧
Look, we didn't come through, okay?

409
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,210
你坚持下来了
You came through!

410
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,830
你都抓了条鱼
Look, you caught a fish!

411
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,080
真了不起
That's really, really impressive.

412
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,730
你怎么做到的
How'd you do it?

413
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,400
空手抓的
With my bare hands.

414
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,230
-不是吧  你太强了  -是啊
- No way! You're so strong. - Yeah.

415
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,310
当时是...我和它搏斗来着...
Yeah, it was... It fought...

416
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,680
你想干嘛
What are you doing?

417
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,710
我没想干嘛  我觉得太了不起了
I'm not doing anything. I think that's amazing.

418
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,290
你为我们带来食物
You provided for us.

419
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:56,430
-你是男人  -别恭维我  杰茜
- You're a man. - Don't patronize me, Jess.

420
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:59,750
-没有啊  -自从我们开始交往  杰茜
- I'm not. - Ever since we started dating, Jess,

421
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,800
做了好多女孩才做的事
we've been doing a bunch of girly stuff,

422
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,270
有些我挺喜欢  而且我喜欢你  但是
and I like some of it and you, but...

423
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,060
我的酒量已经...
My tolerance to alcohol has, like,

424
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,860
低得吓人了
gotten really, scary low.

425
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,690
喝三罐啤酒
I drank three beers, and I got,

426
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,360
我就笑嘻嘻的  还犯困
like, all giggly and tired.

427
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:13,950
不想再喝了
And I didn't want a fourth.

428
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:17,150
昨晚我做了个梦  梦见刷洗一匹马
Last night, I had a dream that I was brushing a horse.

429
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,320
感觉我有点找不到自我了
I just feel like I'm losing myself a little.

430
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:21,820
你就...
Just...

431
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,610
让我吃了这条恶心的鱼吧
Let me eat this disgusting fish and...

432
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,990
-不  尼克  尼克  -让我死这儿得了
- No, Nick, Nick. - Yeah, just let me be over here.

这是我见过的最漂亮的鱼
This is the most beautiful fish I've ever seen.

434
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,070
-别碰  我就不碰它  -真的很漂亮
- Don't touch... I wouldn't touch it. - It is! It is.

435
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,300
杰茜  不要  别把手伸进...
Jess, don't... Don't put your hands in...

436
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,570
我的天...
Oh, my lo...

437
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,320
吐出来
Spit it out.

438
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,140
芳香满口
Fragrant.

439
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:50,070
我能尝到湖水的滋味
Mmm, I can really... I can really taste the lake.

440
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:53,910
-吐出来  -我觉得自己在湖里与鱼嬉戏
- Spit it out. - I feel like I'm there in the lake with the fish.

441
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,250
有刺
Bony.

442
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,040
咽下去的时候有点疼
That's gonna hurt going down.

443
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,760
但是我喜欢
But I like it.

444
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:05,330
痛得好开心  痛得好开心
Hurts so good! Hurts so good!

445
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,120
杰茜  我抓到这条鱼的时候它已经死了
Jess, that fish was dead when I caught it.

446
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,510
还有只袜子浮在旁边
There was a sock near it.

447
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,970
-我陪着你  -不要

我看到了一些有意思的东西
I'm seeing some interesting things.

452
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,860
我星期五之前都不在办公室
I'm out of the office till Friday.

杰茜
Jess!

462
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,070
做决定之前
I just want to see more carpet samples

463
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,630
我想多看看地毯样品
before I make a final decision.

464
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,540
杰茜
Jess!

465
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,540

468
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,700
天啊  都是我的错
Oh, God, this is all my fault.

469
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:01,670
你知道吗教练  我很喜欢那封请柬
You know what coach, I did like the invitation.

470
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,180
是我做的  我喜欢那个小号手
I made it. And I liked the little trumpet guy.

471
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,320
我觉得他很可爱
I thought he was cute.

472
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,710
- 这创意好得不得了  -什么
It's genius as a damn button! - What?

473
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,980
这么多石头
So many stone...

474
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,180
伙计们快看  她在哪
Hey, guys, look. There she is!

475
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,310
这有好多狗印着美元的符号
There are dogs that have dollar signs

476
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,920
但却没有自己的银行
but don't even own banks.

477
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,050
杰茜  我们在这  杰茜
Jess, we're over here! Jess!

478
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:15,730

Wait, wait, wait.

479
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:18,630
那棵树好像以前在哪见过  杰茜  停下
I've seen that tree before. Jess, stop!

480
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,710
捕熊的陷阱
The bear trap!

481
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:21,960
-不要  -我来了
- No! - I'm coming!

482
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:23,950
杰茜
Jess!

483
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,500
头先着地  为什么
Headfirst? Why?

484
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,240
他大爷...
Son of a...

485
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,610
天啊  杰茜  真抱歉
Oh, my God, Jess, I am so sorry.

486
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,480
我是笨蛋
I was an idiot.

487
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,410
这个感恩节计划太蠢了
This Thanksgiving plan was so stupid.

488
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:40,480
你不该吃那条鱼  太对不起了
You shouldn't have eaten that fish. I'm sorry.

489
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,320
别让他们付账单  好吗
Don't let them pay the bill, okay?

490
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:43,320
把支票给我
You bring the check to me.

491
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,930
不吵架了  月亮人
No arguments, moon man.

492
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:46,880
我的天
Oh, my God!

493
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,910
有人受伤吗
Is anyone hurt?

494
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:50,790
我们没事  我可能有几根肋骨骨裂了
We're fine. I may have cracked a few ribs,

495
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:53,870
杰茜神经错乱了
and, uh, Jess is delirious.

496
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,550
我猜她以为自己是兔子
I think she thinks she's a rabbit.

497
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,220
伙计们  我们会想办法  好吗
Guys, we're gonna figure something out, all right?

498
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,980
给我们扔条绳子或者棍子  其他什么也行
Just get us a rope or a stick or something.

499
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,630
-好吧  伙计有什么主意  -你在说什么
- All right, man, so, any ideas? - What are you talk...?

500
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,190
你自己知道  教练  别跟我打哈哈
You know what, Coach? Don't humor me.

501
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,850
-什么啊  -你知道该做什么
- What? - You know what to do.

502
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:07,090
听着  我承认  你露营的本事比我好
Look, I admit it. You're a better camper than I am.

503
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:08,250
你的人生也比我好
You're better at life than I am.

504
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,480
没准跟希希约会也比我好
You're probably better at dating Cece than I am.

505
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,350
那天晚上我看到你们了
I saw you guys the other night

506
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,890
在家门口卿卿我我
inhaling each other in front of the loft.

507
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:17,580
施密特  我们就干了那么点儿事  就没了
Schmidt, that's all we did. That was it.

508
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,810
我问她要不要上楼  她说不要  好吗
I asked her to come upstairs, she said no, okay?

509
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,570
现在她都不回我短信了
And now she won't return any of my text messages.

510
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:23,340
整个旅行她都无视我
She's been ignoring me this whole trip.

511
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:25,460
我一直是"你好哇"  她却"嗯"
I'm all, like, "Hey." She's like, "Mm-hmm."

512
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,010
我就想"什么情况"
I'm like, "What?"

513
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,040
-你笑什么  伙计  -我没笑
- Why are you smiling, dude? - I'm not smiling.

514
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,300
我在这跟你交心呢伙计
I'm over here baring my soul to you, dude,

515
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,710
而你却当着我的面鬼笑
and you're freaking smiling in my face. Yeah.

516
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:34,870
我倾听的时候都是这种表情
This is the face I make when I listen.

517
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:36,670
-你倾听的时候所有牙都呲出来吗  -没有
-All your teeth show when you listen? - I'm not.

518
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,250
你还在笑  我跟你坦诚相待
You're smiling right now. I opened up to you.

519
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,040
-你却惹我生气  别笑了  -我没笑
- You're pissing me off. Stop smiling. - I'm not.

520
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,830
我弄死你  你个疯子
I will wreck you. You're crazy, man.

521
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,350
-你神经病  -住手  听我说
- You're nuts. - Stop it, listen to me.

522
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,110
我们必须马上解决这事
We are going to solve this right now.

523
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,680
好吗  把裤子脱了
All right, take your pants off.

524
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,830
好吧  我不是什么鹰级童子军
Okay, I am no Eagle Scout,

525
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,610
但我会把裤子绑成绳子
but I know how to make a pants rope.

526
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,220
-裤绳  -你真天才
- Pants rope. - You're a genius.

527
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,310
我知道  -好嘞
I know. - Okay.

528
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,000
你也脱裤子吗
Are you gonna take off your pants?

529
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,650
是的  等我脱掉我的
Yeah, right after I take off

530
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:55,480
胸罩之后我们就可以把绳子扔到树上了
my bra so we can anchor the rope to the tree.

531
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,300
-真的会发生吗  -快点脱掉吧
- That's gonna happen for real? - Just take them off now.

532
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,090
看看温斯顿的内裤
Whoa, look at Winston's pants.

533
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,840
上面还有小猫
It's got kittens on it.

534
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,550
不是猫
These aren't kittens.

535
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,080
我不敢相信我竟然是自愿来这里的
I cannot believe I'm here voluntarily.

536
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,450
-太傻了  -脱掉
- So stupid. - Take them off.

537
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,770
脱掉咯
They're coming off.

538
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:09,000
你们两个  抓住绳子
Here, you guys, grab hold of the rope.

539
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,420
好了  你先请  杰茜
Okay, you go first, Jess.

540
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,570
我跟在你后面支援你
I'll be right behind you to support you.

541
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,800
你干什么呢
What are you doing?

542
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:19,210
这样吧  我背着你  咱俩一起上去
Okay, how about this? Get on my back, I'll bring us both up.

544
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,750
你能做到

545
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,990

547
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,100

548
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:31,240
上帝  我要把你弄出去
Oh, God, I'm gonna get you out of here.

549
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,710
你的腿也用上  尼克
Use your legs, Nick.

550

加油

552
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,760
温斯顿  我讨厌你的打底裤  加油
Ah, Winston, I hate your leggings. Come on.

553
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:41,610
快到了
Almost there.

554
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,170
-加油  -上来了
- Let's go. - You got it,

555
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:44,490
成功了

556
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:47,080
成功了
You got it, you...

557
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,830
你个大胖混蛋
You chubby son of a bitch.

558
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,090
骂得好
Yeah.

559
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,450
你还好吗  杰茜  没事吧
You okay, Jess, you all right?

560
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,820
希尔贝利急救中心

561
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:11,260
谢谢你救了我  山顶洞人
Thanks for saving me, mountain man.

562
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,880
我有条来自医生的好消息
So I've got good news from the doctor

563
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:16,170
你没得狂犬病
you don't have rabies.

564
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,670
你身上有贾第鞭毛虫
You have, uh, giardia

565
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:21,070
和一种叫军团病的疾病
and something called Legionnaires' disease.

566
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,530
我很高兴他们能保住你的脚
I'm just glad they were able to save your foot.

567
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,090
什么
What?

568
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:28,140
没  没什么
No, nothing.

569
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,160
别在意
Never mind.

570
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:36,470
我很抱歉整个野营的事
Hey, I'm sorry about the whole camping thing.

571
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:37,940
不  没事的
Oh, no, it's okay.

572
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,410
我真傻
Ah, I was really stupid.

573
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:40,990
我不像我自己了
I haven't been myself.

574
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:44,210
你是我想要的男人
You're the man I want.

575
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:48,000
你想要的只是让大家
All you wanted was for everyone

576
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,800
在感恩节能一起过  杰茜
to be together on Thanksgiving, Jess.

577
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,110
明年吧
Next year.

578
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,500
-薯片  -薯片
- Potato chips. - Chips?

579
00:19:58,770 --> 00:19:59,940
你请客
Maybe a treat.

580
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:08,810
听着  教练  本着感恩节的精神
Listen, Coach, uh, in the spirit of Thanksgiving,

581
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:09,910
我想也许我可以给你
I thought maybe that I could give you

582
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:12,500
有关希希的一些建议
some advice about... about Cece.

583
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,100
你认为我有多绝望
How desperate do you think I am?

584
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,370
我认为你或许非常绝望
I think you're probably very desperate.

585
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:16,490
我非常绝望  我的意思是
I'm very desperate, I mean,

586
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:17,800
她什么像样的回应都没有
she's giving me nothing.

587
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,910
对她说她很漂亮  她说谢谢
Told her she looked pretty, she said thanks.

588
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:21,220
那算哪门子心理战
Mm-hmm. What kind of mind game is that?

589
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,690
教练  任何事对你而言都轻而易举
Look, Coach, things have always come easy to you.

590
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:27,260
但希希不会成为那些事之一
Cece is not going to be one of those things.

591
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,580
我有一次曾经在一辆车窗上砸了
I once spent hours in a car

592
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:32,330
一个透气孔的车里待了好几个小时
with just a cracked window for air.

593
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,440
她进了一家俱乐部
She was going into a club

594
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,020
把我一个人扔在外面
and she just kind of left me there.

595
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,890
你为什么要笑
Why are you smiling about that?

596
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:40,800
伙计们  我想到一个挽救感恩节的办法
Hey, guys, I figured out a way to save Thanksgiving.

597
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:41,890
-我有个计划  -我受够计划了
- I got a plan. - Enough with the plans.

598
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:43,240
-你安排计划的能力糟透了  -否决尼克・米勒的计划
- You suck at plans! - Not another Nick Miller plan.

599
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,360
我爱你  但是你的计划真的超烂
I love you, man, but you are terrible at plans.

600
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:50,170
现在才11点48分  感恩节快乐
It's still 11:48, so happy Thanksgiving.

601
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,180
什么
What?

602
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,090
我们有巴西坚果
Got us some Brazilian nuts,

603
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:55,700
几个字母奶酪  还有点心
a couple of string cheeses, and snack.

604
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,820
谢谢
Thank you.

605
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,370
我手机上可以看感恩节游行
I got the parade on my phone.

606
00:20:58,370 --> 00:20:58,870
太棒了
Yes.

607
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:00,580
做了一些装饰
Made some decorations.

608
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,490
我想这个也许是火鸡三明治
I think this may be a turkey sandwich,

609
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:04,350
不过我不确定
but I'm not sure,

610
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:06,100
我也知道这一切并不是
and I know this whole thing isn't...

611
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:06,810
很完美
It's perfect.

612
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:08,720
大家  你们开动吧别管我
Look, guys, start without me

613
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,830
因为我估计得过几个星期才能吃东西了
because it might be a few weeks before I can eat again.

614
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,800
你吐了很多东西出来
You were throwing up a lot.

615
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:18,240
那太可怕了  真的
That was scary... seriously.

616
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,150
-我饿了  我们开吃吧  -开吃
- Okay, I'm starving actually. Let's eat. - Yeah, let's eat.

617
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:22,180
尼克在森林里找到的这些吃的
Nick found all this food in the woods.

618
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:24,150
我能喝姜汁汽水吗
Can I have the ginger ale?

619
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,770
没问题  尼克找到的  已经开了
Yeah, Nick found that. It's already open.
