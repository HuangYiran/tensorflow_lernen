01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,519
All right, what's so important?
什么事这么重要?

I just heard from my source at MI6 that Edward Bailey's alive and on the run.
我刚从军情六处得到消息说爱德华・白利还活着而且逃跑了

828
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,839

- 这不可能啊  - 这比一个桀骜不驯的将军

829
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:22,968
and his unexploded ordnance. What don't I know?

The things Bailey knows are too dangerous.

我们不能让白利或龙葵落入恐怖分子手中 否则数百万的人将会死

833
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,286
Holy shit, it's real.
见鬼 这是真的

834

Unless we secure it, that weapon's going off in the middle of Moscow.
如果不采取措施 核武器将在莫斯科市中心爆炸

If you are caught or Han catches you,
如果你被抓了或韩追上你了

They paid me to kill you.

Not enough hugs as a child.

to... to being a pariah.

But you know something, Frank?

As though we'd never given them the best years of our lives.
完全不在乎我们把最好的年华献给了他们

901
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,211
Bit of a joke, really.
开个玩笑

902
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:21,089
