1
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:20,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}As I was going up the stair

2
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I met a man who wasn't there

3
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He wasn't there again today

4
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:35,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I wish I wish he'd go away

5
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Where did you learn that?

6
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:42,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Where did you learn that poem?

7
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I made it up.

8
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:48,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}When I was a kid, I made it up.

9
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:55,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What else do you remember from back then?

10
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Don't beat around the bush, doc. Don't beat around the bush.

11
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:08,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Don't beat around the bush. Don't beat around the bush, doc!

12
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:14,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Tell me what you remember about your mother.

13
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I remember my mom.

14
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I remember my mom.

15
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I remember my mom was a whore.

16
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:27,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}How long would she keep you there?

17
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}As long as she was busy.

18
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Do you understand why you're talking with me now?

19
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You're supposed to be good with...

20
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}...headaches.

21
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I need something more than aspirin. Know what I mean?

22
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:13,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Do you remember the murders?

23
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:17,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I remember...

24
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}...that Columbia is the capital of South Carolina.

25
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I remember that...

26
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Are you the person who murdered six residents...

27
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:42,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}...of the Lakeworth Apartments on May 10, 1998?

28
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That's my birthday.

29
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Who am I speaking to right now?

30
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What should I call you?

31
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:07,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Call me whatever you want.

32
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Gary?

33
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Gary?

34
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Gary, you awake?

35
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:27,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yes, Greg, as a matter of fact, I am awake.

36
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm sorry to bother you at home...

37
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:33,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}...but there's gonna be a midnight hearing in the Rivers case.

38
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:37,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The defense found a notebook misfiled in evidence, a diary.

39
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}They argued to the state Supremes that it was suppressed.

40
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What are you talking about?

41
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}There's no media. This all happened under the radar.

42
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The prisoner transport left an hour ago from Ely.

43
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Left Ely? What do you mean? What transport?

44
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:55,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The diary gave them an opening to argue insanity again.

45
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}They need Rivers present, so they drugged him, put him on a transport.

46
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}They're taking this scumbag to a hearing...

47
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}...the night before his execution.

48
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}How the fuck did you let that happen?

49
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Would anyone like to play another round?

50
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Let's get another puzzle, Vanna. What do we have?

51
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- "Around the House" is the category. - Buy a vowel.

52
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Buy a vowel. - Pick up that trip.

53
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Buy a vowel, you idiot. - I'd like to buy a vowel. An E.

54
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}One E.

55
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- All right, 350 left. - N.

56
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Buy a vowel. - Buy another vowel.

57
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Yes! - An I.

58
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- I'd like to solve. - Sure.

59
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}"Kibbles 'n Bits. "

60
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}She won't stop bleeding. She won't stop bleeding.

61
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:57,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Jesus. What happened? - An accident. We had an accident.

62
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Rain and lightning is moving into Elko.

63
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:03,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Doppler Radar has picked up a severe thunderstorm with lightning...

64
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}...on its way from Pershing and Lander counties.

65
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- We could get damaging winds... - Four times 10 equals...

66
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Four times 10...

67
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:14,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Timothy, could you not do that now? We're trying to hear about the storm.

68
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Sure you don't want me to drive? - No.

69
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:23,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'll get us to Anderson, then you can take over after we eat.

70
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Turn into spin.

71
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Apply brakes with short, firm pumps.

72
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Check mirror and gauge indicator and roll...

73
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:41,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}...to a slow, smooth stop.

74
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You okay, honey? Timothy?

75
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Seat belts, seat belts, seat belts.

76
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- It's a shoe. - What?

77
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's a shoe!

78
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:21,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}For he's a jolly good fellow

79
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:26,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}For he's a jolly good fellow

80
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:32,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}For he's a jolly good fellow

81
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:41,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Which nobody can deny

82
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:54,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Shit!

83
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:04,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Why didn't we get a better spare? - Do you know what radials cost, Alice?

84
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Honey, don't get defensive.

85
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:10,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, if the point is to put him, Timothy, into the right school...

86
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- ...it's absurd to focus... - George? George?

87
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- ...on replacement tires. - What can I do to help?

88
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:19,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Nothing. I'm fine, but...

89
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}...thank you.

90
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Alice?

91
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:59,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, my God! Alice? What have you done?

92
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:04,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What have you done? What have you done?

93
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hi, Harry. Where do I begin?

94
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I have walked off the set, okay?

95
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I know they'll say that I am in breach...

96
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}...but they clearly did not read my deal.

97
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}They had me at a Ramada...

98
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, Jesus.

99
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I think I have a spare battery in my bag.

100
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Excuse me?

101
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:35,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I have a spare battery in my bag up front, next to you.

102
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:41,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Any idea which one, Miss Suzanne? - The Louis Vuitton duffel, right on top.

103
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I don't see anything...

104
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:51,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Just use your fucking eyes! It's in the side pocket! Just look!

105
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Jesus!

106
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:05,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What have you done? What have you done?

107
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No, fool! If you help him, you assume responsibility.

108
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:11,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It is my responsibility. Let go of me.

109
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:14,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Alice? Alice?

110
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What have you done? What have you done?

111
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:19,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Let me take a look.

112
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:23,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The driver of every motor vehicle involved in any manner of accident...

113
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}...originating from the operation of a vehicle shall, within 10 days...

114
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:30,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You got a towel or something in the car?

115
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:33,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Okay. Come help me look.

116
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:36,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}... within 10 days of the accident...

117
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}...if you are operating a vehicle and it should, at any time, involve...

118
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:45,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Stay here. Keep her dry. - It's okay. It's okay, honey.

119
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Open the door! We need the phone. - No!

120
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sweetheart, it's okay.

121
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Honey, it's okay.

122
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:59,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Give me the goddamn phone! - The phone is dead, all right?

123
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:04,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You're gonna be fine. You're gonna be okay.

124
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No!

125
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:36,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- She won't stop bleeding. - Jesus. What happened?

126
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:39,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}There was an accident. May I please use your phone?

127
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Please use your phone? - Yeah, sure.

128
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:49,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Shit. I'm not getting a line. It happens in the rain.

129
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The phone doesn't work.

130
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:54,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}St. Jude's has 24-hour emergency, 30 miles east.

131
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Okay.

132
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You sit here, okay?

133
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Keep pressure on the wound. I'll be back with an ambulance.

134
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What are you doing?

135
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sorry. It's a step down from the Ramada, but it'll have to do.

136
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I am not staying here. Are you out of your mind?

137
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:27,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}This is my car. You work for me. Get those bags back in this car now!

138
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:34,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I understand the bleeding person has a medical condition, but so do I.

139
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:39,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}My lung walls have depleted cilia. If I stay here, I could asphyxiate!

140
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No, please, please, please, please, please, please.

141
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:50,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Please!

142
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hey!

143
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Stop. Please, please.

144
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:13,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hi. I'm sorry, my car is stuck. Can I get a ride?

145
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:15,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Okay.

146
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You know you're going east.

147
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hospital's this way.

148
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:43,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's flooded. I mean, it's a dead end.

149
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:47,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yeah, well, if you don't mind, I gotta try.

150
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:56,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Okay, that will be $30 cash, please.

151
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Didn't you use to be that actress?

152
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yes.

153
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:14,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Wow. - Now, is that a nice room?

154
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Because though I am leaving soon, I still would prefer a nice room.

155
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Your nicest...

156
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}...if that is possible.

157
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Eight's very cozy.

158
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:47,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I tried to tell you.

159
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hey! Hey, stop! There's no way through.

160
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}There's no way through! No way through!

161
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Lou, wake up. - What?

162
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Cell phone.

163
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- What? - Do you have a cell phone?

164
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Who wants to know?

165
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}There's been an accident, a bad one. A lady's hurt.

166
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- We need a cell phone right now. - Dude, slow down.

167
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:14,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}First, we don't know who you are. Second, we don't see an accident...

168
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:18,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Listen to me, dude, I'm having a really fucked-up, wet, bad fucking day.

169
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So if you have a cell phone, give it to me now!

170
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:26,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Dude, we don't have a cell phone, so could you just let go of me now? !

171
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I need you to give me a lift in the other direction.

172
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:34,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's flooded that way too. It's worse than this.

173
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ginny, pop the trunk. Let them in.

174
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Let them in.

175
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:00,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hey. How you doing?

176
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:10,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Phone still dead? - Yeah. Where's your Lincoln?

177
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:14,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Stuck in a run-off two miles down the road. The other way's fucked too.

178
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The kids gave us a lift. The girl was stranded.

179
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Is there another way out? - Is she a hooker?

180
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hey! Is there a back road?

181
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Where do you think the water's going? You wouldn't get 500 feet.

182
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- How's the woman? - I don't know. They're in number 4.

183
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:45,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm sorry. We don't rent rooms by the hour.

184
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Funny. You still serving food?

185
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:55,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Vending machines are around the corner. Go ahead.

186
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:59,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Rooms are 30 bucks in advance with picture ID. You need one room or two?

187
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:03,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Excuse me. I was talking to you. I'd appreciate it if you looked at me.

188
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, I don't like looking at trash.

189
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:18,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We're a little stuck here, George. I don't think we can get out tonight.

190
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:23,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- She just keeps shaking. - She's in shock.

191
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Let me take a look. - What?

192
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Let me take a look.

193
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Did your wife pack a sewing kit?

194
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ginny, wait up.

195
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Six.

196
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:05,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}At least we got a good number.

197
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:54,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Did you feel that? - Feel what?

198
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Cold.

199
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Are you the manager?

200
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yeah.

201
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:19,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm Officer Rhodes, Corrections. I'm transporting a prisoner here.

202
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The law gives you the right to refuse us service...

203
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}...but the roads are flooded. I could use a room.

204
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:28,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- It's an emergency. - You got a radio in that car?

205
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:31,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Who's this? - Limo driver, had an accident.

206
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I got a lady pretty banged up. I could use an ambulance.

207
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:37,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Four-four-two requesting medical.

208
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:40,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Four-four-two requesting medical.

209
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Nothing. It's been like this for the past hour.

210
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}She's losing a lot of blood. Got a first aid kit?

211
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Band-Aids, that's it.

212
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- How about a needle and thread? - Maybe in the diner.

213
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:54,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'll get it. Locked up. Stay dry.

214
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'll be back with your key. I'll put you in 10.

215
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Okay, thanks. - What do you got back there?

216
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:03,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Prison transfer.

217
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:06,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Maybe when you get him situated, come to 4 and look at the lady.

218
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- I could use a second opinion. - Yeah, sure.

219
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Looks like you're fucked.

220
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:23,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Shut up!

221
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:39,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- I wish I had beige. - This is fine.

222
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Would have been better.

223
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I gotta get the officer situated. Let me know if you need something.

224
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:47,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'll be right back.

225
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:56,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Where did you learn to do that?

226
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:59,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Pretty much where you're standing.

227
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:15,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hey, is the...?

228
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:19,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The little boy, is he all right?

229
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:21,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He hasn't said a word since the accident.

230
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:26,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No, no, no. He doesn't talk much ever since the...

231
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm his stepfather.

232

233
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Two years ago, he left.

234
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Little temper problem.

235
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Watch your step.

236
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:07,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The furniture's for shit.

237
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:12,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}If you're fixing to cuff him to something, the toilet's bolted down.

238
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:14,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Thank you so much for your assistance.

239
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:17,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- It's a good idea. Come on. - I got stripes

240
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:22,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Stripes around my shoulders And these chains

241
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:24,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}These chains They're about to...

242
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:30,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Let's go look at that lady.

243
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- You get anyone? - What?

244
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:40,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Did you get through? - No, not yet.

245
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Good stitch job.

246
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Pulse is shallow, but steady. Keep her comfortable.

247
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We should take turns on the radio, if that's all right.

248
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No, it's not. I can manage.

249
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You gonna arrest me, officer?

250
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What?

251
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:29,690

252
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:35,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No shit.

253

254
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:44,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- That don't seem right. - You got a better idea?

255
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:48,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I worked mess in the service. Maybe the diner's open. I could...

256

272
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:30,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}...I can't shine living in an environment like that.

273
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:34,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No, it is not about the money. It's about the working conditions.

274
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:08,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}One bar.

287
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- What the hell are you doing? - There's something in there.

00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:29,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But to demonstrate his mental state, which is the purpose... His mental state?

301
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}His mental state?

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Do you know what time it is? You think I got time for bullshit?

304
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:42,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That the justices called me in the middle of the night to review a case...

305
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:46,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}...I already sat on, that I already decided, may make you happy.

00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:48,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But it pisses me off.

316
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:26,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Who's Caroline Suzanne? - The actress I was driving.

317
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:29,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And where exactly did that happen?

318
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We don't know, because we can't find the body.

319
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:34,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Not all of it anyway.

320
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:40,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- What do you mean, you can't find it? - Stay calm. Everything will be all right.

321
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:44,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Officer Rhodes is outside. He was transporting a convict.

322
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:47,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Who escaped. - What are you... ?

323
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Hold on. - Running free!

324
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Will you shut the fuck up so he can talk?

325
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}This is my place, ho! I'll say what I please!

326
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:57,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- It's safe here. - It is not safe here!

327
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- There's a cop here. - Yeah, two cops.

328
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:01,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You're a cop?

329
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:07,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- I was. Shut up, Larry! - It's not safe here! I'm not staying...

330
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's all right. It's okay.

331
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Nothing.

332
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:17,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Is she okay? - Ginny.

333
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:21,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ginny, will you...? Stop it. Don't do this right now.

334
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- What are you doing? - Put your arm around your girlfriend.

335
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Actually, she's my wife. - Everybody just stay here.

336
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:33,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Stay in this room. - Wait! I'm not staying here if he is.

337
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Yes, you are. - No, I'm not.

338
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:38,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- I'm not. - All right. Larry?

339
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Come with us. - Why?

340
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:43,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- You know the place. - Here's what I know. I'm not a cop.

341
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:46,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I don't take orders from a professional slut!

342
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:49,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Fuck you! - Listen. Just stay here, please.

343
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Keep everybody calm.

344
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:03,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He's not gonna get too far. Not in this!

345
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:06,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Rhodes!

346
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What are we chasing here?

347
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Multiple homicide.

348
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'll go around this way. Meet you in back.

349
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Is that where you live full-time? Las Vegas?

350
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:38,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Used to. - What's that supposed to mean?

351
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:43,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It means I don't live there anymore.

352
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:21,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Maine!

353
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:26,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We'll go see if we can use this one. We'll go in here.

354
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:30,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Since that wasn't a successful attempt, we'll go in here.

355
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'll be right out here. It's okay. I'm gonna stand guard.

356
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:40,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Not a worry. I'll be right here. I'm not going anywhere.

357
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:51,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}See, his mother usually does this.

358
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:17,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hey, Ginny. So how long you two been married?

359
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:21,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}About nine hours. It was a spur-of-the-moment kind of thing.

360
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:23,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Viva Las Vegas, huh, Gin?

361
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:27,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- We need to leave! - I was just talking to her.

362
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:30,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Something's happening! I need to get out of here!

363
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:35,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Ginny! Ginny! - You don't own me, Lou!

364
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I own what's inside you! Half, at least.

365
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:41,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You don't own any part of me or my baby!

366
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:43,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Then why did I marry you?

367
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:48,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Don't slam the goddamn door on me! - Hey! Hey!

368
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:51,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You guys, just calm down!

369
00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:01,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We are not leaving. There is no place else to go.

370
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:06,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}There's a flood outside, Ginny. Stop it! Stop it!

371
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:09,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm not pregnant!

372
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What did you just say?

373
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:20,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I lied.

374
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:24,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm not pregnant.

375
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:30,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What are you talking about? I saw the test.

376
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:37,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Why would you do that to me?

377
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:42,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Because Alison saw you at The Hawk with that fucking girl!

378
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Ginny, what are we, like 15? - Go away!

379
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:54,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Goddamn!

380
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:16,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Open this goddamn door, Ginny! - No!

381
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:19,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I haven't been to The Hawk in over a fucking year.

382
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:25,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Alison is a stupid bitch-whore, who likes fucking with your head.

383
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:28,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Open the damn door, Ginny.

384
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:32,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Open the fucking door! - Not until you calm down!

385
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:36,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm calm! I am very fucking calm!

386
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What are you doing?

387
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:54,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Lou?

388
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:12,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ginny, open this damn door! Open the door!

389
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:16,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Open the door! - Stop it, stop it!

390
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:21,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ginny, damn it, open the door! Ginny, Ginny, Ginny!

391
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:24,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Lou, please stop!

392
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Lou?

393
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:50,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

394
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:53,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Help me! Somebody help me!

395
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:03,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Help me!

396
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:07,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Help me! Somebody help me!

397
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Is he in there? Is he in there?

398
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:16,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ginny, are you okay? What happened? What happened?

399
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:26,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Oh, shit. - Jesus Christ.

400
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Lou? Lou?

401
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What's going on?

402
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:05,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What the hell?

403
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, shit!

404
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:14,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Come here!

405
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}They caught him. They caught him.

406
00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:43,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Why are we keeping him in here?

407
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:47,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Where would you prefer, Larry? - I don't know.

408
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:50,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I told you to stay in 3, didn't I? Did I tell you that?

409
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:55,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}They got in a fight! I tried to get them to go back inside!

410
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:58,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Should we try the radio again?

411
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:02,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Larry, just stay here and watch him.

412
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:06,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Go back and look after Ginny. - Where are you going?

413
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:09,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Just do it, please.

414
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ed?

415
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:17,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I don't know if I'm comfortable with guard duty, per se.

416
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:21,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He's unconscious, Larry. He's tied to a post.

417
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Timmy.

418
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:52,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Timmy.

419
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:04,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Alice? Oh, my God. Alice?

420
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I don't remember anything.

421
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:11,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We had an accident

422
00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:14,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}George? Can you keep an eye on Ginny for a minute?

423
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:21,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}She's awake now. I have to get some aspirin to help her.

424
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:25,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Darling, I gotta go get something out of my room.

425
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:45,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Shit! - What's wrong, buddy?

426
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:47,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What do you got in the fridge?

427
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- You shut up. - What's in there?

428
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:56,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What's in there?

429
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:58,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- What do you got in there? - Shut up.

430
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:00,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What is it, huh?

431
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:02,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Shut up. - You can tell me.

432
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:07,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm good at keeping secrets. I got a whopper myself.

433
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:28,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What are you doing?

434
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:29,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Motherfucker!

435
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:33,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- What are you doing out here? - Getting shit that's mine.

436
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:37,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What are you doing? What, I don't get to ask a question?

437
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:41,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm taking photos. There's been two murders. Before all the evidence...

438
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:45,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That's not an answer. You're a limo driver. What are you doing?

439
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:49,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Looking to win some "beyond the call of duty," limo-driver merit badge?

440
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:52,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You're not on the job anymore. You don't need to be a hero.

441
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:55,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}There's a real, live, active-duty cop outside...

442
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:58,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The one who's managed to lose a convicted killer?

443
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You're a complicated cat, Edward.

444
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:06,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No. Not really.

445
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:09,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I think so.

446
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:13,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What month were you born?

447
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:17,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- May. - Taurus.

448
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:19,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Same as me.

449
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:26,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Where were you a cop? - Los Angeles.

450
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:30,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Were you fired or did you quit?

451
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:33,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I took medical leave.

452
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:36,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It was making me sick.

453
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:41,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I burned out, I guess. Wasn't up for it.

454
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:47,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}One day I got a call...

455
00:48:49,790 --> 00:48:52,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}...for a jumper.

456
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:54,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}A young Mexican girl.

457
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:00,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Pregnant, infected with AIDS, totally strung-out.

458
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:04,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}She was truly one of the doomed.

459
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:11,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I asked her to come in off the ledge and into my arms.

460
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:14,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}She asked me why she should bother living.

461
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:23,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What did you say?

462
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:28,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I was trained to tell her lots of things.

463
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:32,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Her dreams, all the people who'd miss her.

464
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:35,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But for a second, I hesitated.

465
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:38,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And she saw it.

466
00:49:42,210 --> 00:49:47,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Within that second, I couldn't think of one optimistic thing to say to her.

467
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:54,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So she spread her arms and jumped.

468
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:02,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I started getting headaches...

469
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:07,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}...and eventually started blacking out.

470
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:13,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So I filed for medical.

471
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:31,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What?

472
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What is it?

473
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:41,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Rhodes!

474
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:46,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- It's worse. Nothing but static! - Where's that key from the actress?

475
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:50,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}This was on the kid.

476
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:54,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- What is it, some kind of countdown? - Larry!

477
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:01,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What the fuck is he doing? Larry, come over here!

478
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:05,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Come over here, man. What are you doing? Come over here.

479
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:10,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- What are you doing? - I just went to get something.

480
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:14,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We told you to watch the guy. What are you doing in your office?

481
00:51:15,470 --> 00:51:16,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I just went to get something.

482
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:20,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}How many sets of keys are there to this place? Look at me. How many?

483
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:23,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Two and a master set. - Oh, my fucking God!

484
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:30,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Larry, you mother... ! You son of a... ! Get the fuck in here! Get in here!

485
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Why did you kill him? Why did you kill my con?

486
00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:40,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Holy shit! Who did that? Jesus Christ, I didn't do that!

487
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Bullshit! You're lying!

488
00:51:42,330 --> 00:51:46,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- It's your bat sticking out of his throat! - I know, but I didn't do it!

489
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Check the doors!

490
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:49,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- I didn't do it! - Look at him!

491
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:53,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Why'd you kill him? - Why were you outside?

492
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:55,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Why'd you leave him? - I was scared.

493
00:51:55,710 --> 00:51:57,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- What were you scared of? - You wouldn't understand.

494
00:51:58,110 --> 00:51:59,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Try me.

495
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:01,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Why'd you kill my con? - I didn't!

496
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:05,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I don't know how... I went to my office, that's all!

497
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:08,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Why'd you leave him? - This your key? Number 8?

498
00:52:08,590 --> 00:52:11,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ten, nine, eight, huh? This is your key!

499
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:13,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You can't say that! Those aren't my keys!

500
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:16,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That's like leading the witness or something. Look.

501
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:20,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}These are my keys, okay? These are my keys. You see?

502
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:24,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You got a Gucci wallet? It's the actress's.

503
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:28,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yes, I took her wallet. Afterwards. After she died!

504
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:34,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Afterwards, all right? I didn't kill her. And I didn't kill him.

505
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:39,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Let her go, Larry. - Get back! You won't pin this on me.

506
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Timothy? - Get him out of here!

507
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:45,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Put it down. - I didn't hurt anybody. No one!

508
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:48,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But I don't like cheap fucking whores! If you take one more step...

509
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:51,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Fuck!

510
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:01,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Get it off!

511
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:06,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Shit!

512
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:16,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Come on, you little bitch. Please fucking start.

513
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:20,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Goddamn it! - Hey!

514
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:23,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Larry, stop!

515
00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:28,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What is going on?

516
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:30,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Larry! - Get out of my way, I didn't do shit!

517
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:36,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Timothy! Timothy!

518
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:01,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}An insanity plea was refused by the court...

519
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:06,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}...despite the fact that my client is a certifiable Axis IV dissociative.

520
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:11,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}To this day, he remains unaware of the crimes for which he was convicted.

521
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:17,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}In 1986, the Supreme Court ruled decisively that states cannot execute...

522
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:20,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}...a person who does not understand why he's being put to death.

523
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:22,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He signed a confession.

524
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:25,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- He didn't just sign it, he dictated it. - Thirdly...

525
00:54:26,090 --> 00:54:31,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}...Malcolm's diaries found misfiled in state evidence.

526
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:36,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}this notebook contains entries made just before the murders.

527
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:41,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Important to note are the spectacular changes in handwriting style...

528
00:54:41,410 --> 00:54:43,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}...tone, point of view.

529
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:48,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What you are looking at are the private thoughts of several different people.

530
00:54:48,350 --> 00:54:52,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}With permission, Dr. Mallick will elaborate.

531
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:54,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Thank you.

532
00:54:55,050 --> 00:54:58,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Your Honor, there is no universally efficacious treatment...

533
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}...for Dissociative Identity Disorder.

534
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:06,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}In theory, one attempts to move the patient towards integration.

535
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- A folding of their fractured psyche. - Your Honor?

536
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He's here.

537
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:32,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No! What you saw was an accident!

538
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:35,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He ran out in front of me! I'm not a murderer!

539
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:37,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}There's a dead body in your freezer, Larry.

540
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:40,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- I didn't kill him. I found him like that. - Stop it!

541
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Listen! Listen! I was in Vegas last month and I lost everything, okay?

542
00:55:44,070 --> 00:55:45,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Everything!

543
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:49,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I drove west. I didn't know where to go, but I was running on empty...

544
00:55:49,270 --> 00:55:51,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}...so I pulled in here at this place.

545
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:56,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And there was no one at the station, so I came over to the office...

546
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:58,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}...and I walked in.

547
00:55:58,350 --> 00:56:01,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And there, sitting at that desk right there, was the manager...

548
00:56:01,390 --> 00:56:04,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}...facedown in a Banquet Potpie. Dead!

549
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:07,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Heart attack or something. - Banquet Potpie!

550
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:10,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He'd been sitting there for God knows how long.

551
00:56:10,430 --> 00:56:14,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}All of a sudden, this auto-parts salesman pulls up, looking for a room.

552
00:56:14,630 --> 00:56:16,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I didn't have a fucking dime...

553
00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:19,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}...so I took his 30 and gave him one.

554
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:24,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I just took the key from the wall and gave him a room.

555
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:28,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Maybe that was wrong, but I was broke, and that's what I did.

556
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:31,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Then I came back in here...

557
00:56:32,250 --> 00:56:35,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}...and I moved Larry's body... His name was Larry too.

558
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:39,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I put him in the freezer.

559
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:44,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I wasn't trying to hide him. It was hot out.

560
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:49,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I thought it was the best place for him till his family or someone came along.

561
00:56:49,930 --> 00:56:52,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Only no one did...

562
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:55,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}...except more guests.

563
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:58,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So I checked them in too.

564
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:02,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And they all seemed happy...

565
00:57:02,310 --> 00:57:04,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}...so I just stayed.

566
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:09,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Cry me a river. This is a total crock of shit!

567
00:57:09,350 --> 00:57:11,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- No, it's not! - Admit it, you killed him!

568
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:14,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Just like you killed my con. Just like you killed her husband.

569
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:17,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Just like you killed his actress. Just admit it.

570
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:21,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Say it, "I killed them." - Stop it! He can't take any more!

571
00:57:21,570 --> 00:57:25,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Everything is okay now. Everything is fine. We got the guy. It's fine.

572
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:27,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- I don't know what we got. - What?

573
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:29,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We thought we got the guy two hours ago, then...

574
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:32,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You believe this shit? It's him! It's this guy!

575
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:34,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He had a knife to your neck, remember?

576
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:38,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}His story's so unbelievable, I think it just might be true.

577
00:57:39,650 --> 00:57:41,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}She's got a point.

578
00:57:44,090 --> 00:57:46,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You guys are crazy.

579
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:48,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Maybe it's the burial ground.

580
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:51,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What?

581
00:57:53,430 --> 00:57:57,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Read the brochure in there. It's all around us.

582
00:57:57,770 --> 00:58:00,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}A hundred years ago, the government moved these Indians here.

583
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:04,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}They all died because there was no water.

584
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:08,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Now they're coming back to life like sea monkeys, huh?

585
00:58:08,910 --> 00:58:10,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Come on. Give me a break, sweetheart.

586
00:58:11,050 --> 00:58:13,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Just take it easy, Rhodes. - You know, you take it easy!

587
00:58:13,550 --> 00:58:17,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You've tried to run this show all night. Giving orders, pointing fingers!

588
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:20,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You blamed my con for everything, and he ends up dead.

589
00:58:20,590 --> 00:58:23,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm telling you, it's him! We all saw him run down George.

590
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:27,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Your actress's wallet is right there. She's dead, there's the wallet.

591
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:30,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- What more do you want? - Stop it! Please shut up!

592
00:58:31,370 --> 00:58:34,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}All right. You want a plan? Here's the plan, okay?

593
00:58:34,670 --> 00:58:38,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No one's gonna move. We'll stay here, like this, in this room until dawn.

594
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:41,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No one leaves, no one moves.

595
00:58:41,410 --> 00:58:44,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And if he tries anything, I'm gonna shoot him!

596
00:58:44,550 --> 00:58:47,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And if something out there comes in here, I'll shoot it!

597
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:50,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And if anyone of us tries anything, I'll shoot them!

598
00:58:50,990 --> 00:58:52,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- We get it. - Good!

599
00:59:26,290 --> 00:59:28,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Timmy? Timmy?

600
00:59:28,930 --> 00:59:32,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- You need to stay in here with us. - It's all right.

601
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:42,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Remember that movie where the 10 strangers went to an island...

602
00:59:42,310 --> 00:59:44,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}...and then they all died one by one...

603
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:49,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}...and then it turned out they weren't strangers, they all had a connection?

604
00:59:49,410 --> 00:59:51,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}They all messed with the wrong guy, and he was getting revenge.

605
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:53,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Shut up!

606
00:59:54,950 --> 00:59:58,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm just saying maybe there's a connection between all of us.

607
00:59:58,460 --> 00:59:59,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Like what?

608
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:03,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- We're all in Nevada. - Shut up!

609
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:09,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Where were you going with your con when you pulled in here?

610
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:14,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Carson City. Okay?

611
01:00:15,970 --> 01:00:20,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I was going home to Florida. Where were you going?

612
01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:22,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I was taking the actress to L.A.

613
01:00:22,450 --> 01:00:23,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I was born in Florida.

614
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:27,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Since you been in that chair, no one's died, so shut up!

615
01:00:27,990 --> 01:00:29,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No one's died since we've all been here!

616
01:00:29,590 --> 01:00:32,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Hey, sweetie, sit down. - Where in Florida, Larry?

617
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:38,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Where in Florida? - Friends now, huh? Great.

618
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:42,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Polk County. - That's where I was born.

619
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:45,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Which town? - Mulberry.

620
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:48,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Frostproof. - No wonder you left.

621
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:51,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}There's a town called Frostproof?

622
01:00:51,510 --> 01:00:55,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}They grow oranges. The name doubles as a slogan.

623
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:59,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I danced hallelujah the day I left Polk. Why would you wanna go back?

624
01:00:59,550 --> 01:01:02,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I found a grove for sale on the Internet.

625
01:01:02,690 --> 01:01:06,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Nine acres, 1200 trees. Limes and oranges.

626
01:01:06,790 --> 01:01:10,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}According to the realtor, the soil needs a few tills, phosphorous...

627
01:01:10,530 --> 01:01:16,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}...lanes need reading, but it's real good land.

628
01:01:20,970 --> 01:01:22,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What?

629
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:25,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It sounds nice.

630
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:47,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ed?

631
01:01:50,770 --> 01:01:53,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}She's dead.

632
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:15,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Get him out of here.

633
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:18,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Come on. Come on, sweetie.

634
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:28,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Look at this.

635
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:36,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Where'd you get that? - Right here.

636
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:45,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}This doesn't make any sense. She died from an accident.

637
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:50,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}George was an accident, if you believe Larry.

638
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Where is seven?

639
01:02:58,100 --> 01:03:00,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Back it up!

640
01:03:36,310 --> 01:03:41,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- See, I told you it wasn't me! - That's not possible.

641
01:03:41,180 --> 01:03:45,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I was standing right there. I saw what happened. We all saw what happened.

642
01:03:45,450 --> 01:03:48,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He ran out. Nobody could have known he was gonna do that.

643
01:03:49,150 --> 01:03:50,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No one human.

644
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:53,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We're back to that again? It's the spirits, huh?

645
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:57,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Maybe it's the ghost of the guy that Larry put in the freezer.

646
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:01,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Somebody untie me. Goddamn it!

647
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:03,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You know it wasn't me. Come on.

648
01:04:03,370 --> 01:04:05,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- We gotta get out... - Listen. - We gotta get out...

649
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:07,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Take her car and get out. You, her and the kid.

650
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:08,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}There's nowhere to go.

651
01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:11,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- How much gas do you have? - Half a tank.

652
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:13,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You can drive till dawn on that. Look at me.

653
01:04:13,610 --> 01:04:16,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}When you get to where it's flooded, go the other way.

654
01:04:16,450 --> 01:04:17,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I don't know if I can.

655
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:21,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Get the kid and go. Right now. Come on.

656
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:22,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Timmy.

657
01:04:22,450 --> 01:04:25,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Timmy, come on. Let's go. Get up.

658
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:26,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What's going on?

659
01:04:26,590 --> 01:04:28,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- They can't leave! - This way.

660
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:30,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We'll see you when the storm breaks.

661
01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:33,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hey! Hey! They can't leave! Where are they going? Get back here!

662
01:04:34,130 --> 01:04:35,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Go, go, go! They're leaving.

663
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:37,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- They're not leaving. - Go!

664
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:40,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You can't let suspects leave after four people have been killed!

665
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:43,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- You really think they're suspects? - They're not leaving!

666
01:04:50,010 --> 01:04:51,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Shit.

667
01:04:52,050 --> 01:04:53,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ginny!

668
01:04:55,890 --> 01:04:58,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Extinguishers. Larry, you got a fire extinguisher?

669
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:01,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Fire extinguisher! Where? - Back there!

670
01:05:24,650 --> 01:05:26,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Nobody in there.

671
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:34,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Maybe it got so hot, they got cremated.

672
01:05:35,090 --> 01:05:37,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}There'd be something left.

673
01:05:41,430 --> 01:05:42,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You did this.

674
01:05:43,430 --> 01:05:46,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You did this! You told them to get into the car!

675
01:05:46,770 --> 01:05:48,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Are you happy?

676
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:14,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Where is he?

677
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:16,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Nothing.

678
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:24,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I give up!

679
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:28,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I give up! What the hell do you want?

680
01:07:28,510 --> 01:07:32,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What do you want, you sick bastard? What the fuck do you want from us?

681
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:38,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I am turning 30 next week and I just want to go home...

682
01:07:38,380 --> 01:07:40,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}...and grow oranges!

683
01:07:46,990 --> 01:07:49,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's my birthday next week. The 10th.

684
01:07:49,890 --> 01:07:52,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's my birthday next week. The 10th.

693
01:08:22,030 --> 01:08:24,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What are the odds? Must be 10 trillion-to-one.

694
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:28,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What is it?

695
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:46,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Where's the fuse box, Larry? - Other side of the building.

713
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:17,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Edward? - What's happening?

714
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:20,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Please be quiet. - He can hear what we're saying?

01:10:20,610 --> 01:10:23,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Of course I can hear what you're fucking saying.

716

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Edward, you missed your last appointment. Where have you been?

717
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:33,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Did I black out again? - Try and think back.

01:10:33,890 --> 01:10:36,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Where have you been?

01:10:36,530 --> 01:10:39,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}All right. I was driving this actress...

720
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:44,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}...and we got stuck at the motel. There was a storm.

721
01:10:45,770 --> 01:10:48,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We couldn't get out because of the storm.

722
01:10:48,610 --> 01:10:50,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What happened at the motel?

723
01:10:53,610 --> 01:10:56,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}People started dying.

724
01:10:56,510 --> 01:10:59,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And then their bodies... It didn't make any sense.

725
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:01,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}They disappeared.

726
01:11:03,990 --> 01:11:06,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Edward, I'd like to show something to you, if I may.

727
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:14,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Do you recognize this man?

728
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:17,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No.

729
01:11:18,370 --> 01:11:21,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That man, Edward, is Malcolm Rivers.

730
01:11:21,370 --> 01:11:24,970
