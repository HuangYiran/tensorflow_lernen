{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gravity behave.

110
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know what's more unsettling

111
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:28,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that you accessorize with that brainless rodent

112
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or that you converse with it too.

113
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I like ferrets.

114
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:35,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've never been terribly fond of rats or weasels.

115
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:38,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing personal.

116
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well out with the old in with the new as they say.

117
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's get on with it. Karl why is a cappuccino not touching my lips?

118
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Uh... - Don't speak.

119
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:53,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh let me introduce you to some members of our team.

120
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fueling in progress.

121
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:59,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh Slats Bentley is our Flight Dynamics Officer.

122
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:01,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He will give you some details on today's mission.

123
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:04,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Executing override sequence.

124
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...approximately four days to get to the Moon and back.

125
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Once we land on the surface we'll stay for 30 minutes

126
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,620


127
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:13,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then re-launch back into space and head back home.

128
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good. Uh over here.

129
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh this is Astro Spaulding.

130
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh she is our pilot for the mission.

131
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The pilot will be flying the spacecraft using a vectra system

132
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:27,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}vision-enabled control technology response array.

133
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:31,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Um the uh systems will be controlled with the blink of an eye

134
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:35,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It just scans your retina. It's all hands-free.

135
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:38,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought there were no life forms on this mission not even a pilot.

136
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:41,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Astro will remotely pilot Vision One from Mission Control.

137
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:46,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ultimately when we begin commercial travel uh... uh...

138
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...the remote system will serve as a backup

139
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in the event of a malfunction or a pilot illness or...

140
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sir there's been a break in the weather.

141
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:57,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah well excuse us gentlemen.

142
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh this is our big moment.

143
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:04,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dr. Finkel could you check and see if the tour group has arrived

144
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and then greet them and help the kids if they have any questions.

145
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Certainly Mr. Wolfson.

146
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:11,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sir!

147
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:22,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK people off the bus. Don't forget your lunch...

148
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK stop right here kids.

149
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Welcome to Vision Enterprises. Everyone in. Don't touch anything.

150
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't want to miss the launch. This way!

151
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My! Oh dog germs!

152
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:48,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Again please refrain from touching anything with your hands

153
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:51,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you slimy little germ-infested creatures.

154
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:53,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK.

155
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our goal here at Vision Enterprises for some reason

156
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:00,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is to make space travel accessible for everyone

157
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:03,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}including the family pet.

158
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's hide over there dudes.

159
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Quiet. They'll hear us.

160
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Scanning.

161
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:13,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Wow. -  Human boy.

162
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is awesome.

163
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:27,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As you can see we have some specifically designed space suits.

164
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:31,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and then do whatever you'd like...

165
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Excuse me. - Huh?

166
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:36,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please step away from the circle.

167
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:40,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That device scans a life form and determines the right size suit.

168
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:42,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is highly sophisticated. So please step away.

169
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:45,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I get a picture with the suit?

170
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:50,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No you cannot have a picture with the suit.
Please just take it off immediately.

171
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:56,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh all right you know what? It's fine it's fine.

172
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can keep the suit on. You probably already contaminated it.

173
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Just come back to the group. - Yeah.

174
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:04,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Children this portion of the tour is over. Please follow me.

175
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you. Excuse me. Thank you.

176
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Check out the fly gear.

177
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh my gosh!

178
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These outfits are so to die for.

179
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rosebud where are you going?

180
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Device on.

181
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Scanning.

182
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Wow. - Canine puppy.

183
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa dudes.

184
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will one of you boys zip me up?

185
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've gotta try this.

186
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Scanning.

187
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So how do I look?

188
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh like our sister in a space suit.

189
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know I look tight.

190
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:15,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mine's a little too tight. Someone give me a paw.

191
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't pull his paw!

192
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Check it. It's the Goodyear blimp.

193
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:41,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go see the spacecraft up close.

194
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Golly gosh maybe we could stop at the lunch pad for a snack

195
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:45,310


196
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if it's on the way.

197
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Budderball that says "launch pad".

198
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oxidize and loading is complete.

199
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:27,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And voila

200
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:29,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the spacecraft.

201
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}T-minus three minutes to launch.

202
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:37,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow. I wish Buddha was here to see this.

203
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's just take a quick look inside

204
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:45,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then we'll come back and watch the launch.
Uh...

205
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you think it's safe?

206
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:51,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You never know how deep a puddle is until you jump in.
Huh?

207
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:55,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh... I'll be right back.

208
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:00,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Seriously dawg what does a puddle have to do with the spaceship?

209
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:02,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoo-hoo! Oh yeah!

210
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:04,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on let's go.

211
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:07,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}T- minus two minutes to launch.

212
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa. It's amazing.

213
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:19,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I would've blinged it out a little more.

214
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:22,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I call shotgun.

215
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,090

237
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't press anything.

238
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Boosters. - Go flight.

241
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Flight out. - It's a go.

242
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guidance uh navigation.

262
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is like a ride on Space Mountain!

263
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad always said I should be more down to Earth.

267
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:48,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't recommend lift-off on a full stomach.

00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:50,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was heavenly.

284
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who turned off that zero grav stuff?

00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:06,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Warning fuel low.

00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:11,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Somehow we are short a quarter of our fuel supply.

288
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuel low.

00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well first things first. Identify the source of the problem.

290
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:19,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know what the problem is.

291
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tank three was never completely filled.

00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:25,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The registries were blank. It doesn't make any sense.

293
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:28,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She'll never make it to the Moon and back with that kind of shortage.

294
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hmm it pains me to say this

295
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:36,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I don't think we have any other option here but to abort the mission.

296
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:46,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Astro how much time before we have to abort?

297
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:49,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Approximately ten hours sir.

298
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good. Stay on course. Um...

299
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:57,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK... We have some time to solve this people. I need solutions.

300
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:59,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buddha I'm home.

00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:04,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Buddha?

302

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yo B-Dawg

303
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:09,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm back in the crib. Let's bust some moves.

304
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:13,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rosebud come on let's go get a mani pedi

305
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and a blow dry.

306
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rosebud?

307
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Budderball I have your favorite dinner.

308
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Budderball?

309
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I knew we shouldn't have made him take a bath.

310
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:39,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think we're getting further and further away from home.

311
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And further and further away from dinner.

312
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:44,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I take full responsibility.

313
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:58,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sir I think we may have finally figured out a solution.

314
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great. I... I... knew you would.

315
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nice work. Let's hear it.

316
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:08,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK we think that we can refuel at the old Russian research space station.

317
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But that space station disintegrated

318
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}into the Earth's atmosphere like years ago.

319
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well yeah but you said to check everything so I checked everything

320
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:19,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}including the conspiracy websites which said the station still in space.

321
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:22,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The reason that no one has been able to find the space station

322
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is because it's not in it's original position.

323
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Somehow it has gotten out of geostationary orbit.

324
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And one of the Russian cosmonauts he survived

328
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:41,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you read me?

329

332
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:53,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course I help you my comrades.

333
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yuri this is Pi.

334
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:58,830

344
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:35,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So we are free to live peacefully in space

345

370
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We should explore and broaden our horizons.

371
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:32,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Broaden our horizons?

372
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're lost in space dawg.

373
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think our horizons are broad enough.

374
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I ain't going nowhere.

00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:47,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we'll need someone to defend the spaceship.

377
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did... Did you say aliens?

385
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:28,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right well when we get our 3000 pounds of fuel...

386
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...we are going to the Moon.

387

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because I float like a butterfly and... and sting like a bee dawg.

390
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:02,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is this place?
Huh?

391
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's an alien!

392
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:10,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's B-Dawg! He's in trouble!

395
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:28,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh...

397
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:33,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Though I suppose if I stay in space any longer I may qualify.

398
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The name is Spudnick.

399
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're the Buddies. The pup in the chicken suit is B-Dawg

400
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the dirty dude is Mudbud the Zen pup is Buddha

401
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and Rosebud is our little sis.

402

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nice to meet you. I'm a Russian dogmonaut.

404
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:52,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We kind of got on the ship by accident.

405
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And now we have no idea where we are.

406
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're aboard the RRSS

407
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the old Russian Research Space Station.

408
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want me to show you around?

409
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Follow me.

410
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:11,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In this module we have our garden

411
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:15,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}where we grow all our food in space.

412
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:19,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The added benefit is the plants filter out CO2 gas and produce oxygen.

413
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And we also use them to create fuel for the station.

414
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now this joint is off the chain insane cuz.

415
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:37,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes we've been off the orbital grid
for quite some time if that's what you mean.

416
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:40,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Over here we have our solar panels which produce all our energy.

417
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:46,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you can keep the stereo pumpin' 24l7. That's wicked.

418
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:52,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right over here is the kitchen.

419
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:58,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My favorite room in the house.

420
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Huh?

421
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hmm. Where's the beef?

422
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Dude what is that? - Space juice.

423
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:20,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pee-yoo! It stinks. Who'd wanna drink that?

424
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:23,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well Yuri seems to like it. And we use it for fuel.

425
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:26,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's Yuri?
He's the Russian cosmonaut I live with up here.

426
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How long have you been up here dude?

427
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:31,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not really sure. It's all one long night in space.

428
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:35,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was only supposed to be on this station for a six month mission

429
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I'm sure it's been years and years.

430
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Spudnick?

431
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:44,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Spudnick? Where has my little puppy puppy gone?

432
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Spudnick...

433
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:51,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yaaa-hoo!

434
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you believe it Spudnick?

435
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:02,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our American comrades have given us a surprise gift!

436
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:07,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Five fluffy puppies to keep us company here in space.

437
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you! Thank you!

438
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:12,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He doesn't understand Spudnick.

439
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:14,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're not staying long.

440
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where that spaceship goes we go.

441
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right come on Spudnick.

442
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:20,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good.

443
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:24,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We will finish refueling and then... we will celebrate.

444
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dude you have to help us.

445
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Puppy puppies!

446
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:38,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dudes we've been hoodwinked.

447
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:42,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're telling me! OK this food is all vegetables.

448
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now what?

449
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:48,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh we'll be ready to leave in less than 30 minutes.

450
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The sooner we can get refueled

451
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:54,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and get away from this bucket of bolts the happier I will be.

452
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:10,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To life in space for eternity and forever.

453
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:11,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And to you Spudnick.

454
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:13,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A spaceman's best friend.

455
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:15,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And to the new puppy puppies.

456
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:20,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We will live together as a happy family till the end.

457
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah. Whoo!

458
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:32,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want to get the dancing started?

459
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:34,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a good idea Spudnick.

460
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's get jiggle with it.

461
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:49,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah I'm not sure he's flying with a full jetpack.

462
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's crazy.

463
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:00,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh ho!

464
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:05,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Another you party animal?

465
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:09,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am sorry old pal. I am pooped.

466
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:12,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right one more one more.

467
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:14,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK let's do it.

468
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well...

469
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:28,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dudes I saw the Jamaican bobsled team do this.

470
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Three two one push!

471
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait guys! I changed my mind!

472
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told you guys this was a bad idea.

473
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:48,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The dog's down for the count.

474
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:52,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What a shame 'cause these space nachos are gnarly.

475
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Huh space nachos?!

476
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's OK.

477
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:13,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These are gonna be the longest 11 minutes in my life.

478
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:18,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah!

479
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oooh.

480
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:24,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oo-y kapoo-y!

481
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yuri is knicker knackered.

482
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:31,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Spudnick you know Yuri.

483
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:34,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Too much dancing Yuri gets too much sleepy.

484
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:43,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh that's nice. Hold me closer tiny dancer.

485
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:51,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh that's nice.

486
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:57,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Little Yuri. That's very nice.

487
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:00,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh Spudnick.

488
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My blanky.

489
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe Yuri take 40 blinks.

490
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:13,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just until the refueling is done.

491
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hmm.

492
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Huh?

493
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Quick! It's Yuri!

494
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hide!

495
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buddies where are you?

496
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:54,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Spudnick.

497
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:01,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sir I'm showing that the tanks are full but the pressure is building.

498
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:04,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What happened to the crazy cosmonaut? - He's asleep.

499
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yuri this is uh

500
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Vision Enterprises do you hear me?

501
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:13,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is my last chance to go home to my boy Sasha.

502
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:15,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The station is falling apart anyhow.

503
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:17,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And Yuri's plan is to go down with the ship.

504
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you hear me? Wake up.

505
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:23,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Da. Da. Yuri is just having a little kitty nap.

506
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Can I hitch a ride home with you guys? - For shizzle dawg.

507
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:37,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hope I never need it but better safe than sorry.

508
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:41,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Refueling is complete. Can we disconnect the ship?

509
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

510
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:46,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The puppies are loose!

511
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:48,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You American dognappers! - What?

512
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:54,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh no! The station is going into lockdown! Yuri's on to us.

513
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:57,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dudes I say we make like a bread truck and haul buns!

514
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:28,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! No come back! Puppy! No!

515
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You guys where's Budderball?

516
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Huh?

517
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:38,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can't leave without him.

518
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:41,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know our motto dudes: No pup left behind.

519
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Budderball come on!

520
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not without my broccoli.

521
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:58,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! Please! Don't take away my puppy puppy pups!

522
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:00,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait a second? Is he talking about puppies?

523
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's got more screws loose than the space station.

524
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come back! You cannot leave!

525
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:14,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You cannot take my gift away from me!

526
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:16,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think he might be trying to shanghai the Vision One.

527
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:19,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Enact emergency evacuation measures.

528
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:32,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's detach from the station now.
Copy that.

529
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,120


530
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not good.

531
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa!

532
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:06,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dude it's coming apart!

533
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:13,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow! That's the Cosmopod escape vessel. He made it!

534
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:22,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Signal lost.

535
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Termination detected. RRSS destruction confirmed.

536
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:36,720

537
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nope haven't seen hide nor fur of them.

538
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry. We'll find them.

539
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:45,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where there's a will there's a way.

540
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:48,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Mm-hm. - Yeah.

541
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:54,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you ready to go home Spudnick?

542
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:59,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buddies we are not heading to Earth.

543
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:02,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The coordinates show we are going to the Moon.

544
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Moon?

545
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:05,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The ship is being controlled from Earth.

546
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:08,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes it seems as though it is taking us to the Moon.

547
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:27,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sure Buddha and the other Buddies
are out there on some wonderful adventure.

548
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:31,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I feel like he's a million miles away.

549
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:33,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know sweetie.

550
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:35,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll find him.

551
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's get some sleep now.

552
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:58,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come home soon.

553
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:19,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Spudnick are you awake?

554
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

555
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you thinking about?

556
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was thinking about my boy Sasha.

557
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:28,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hope he's still waiting for me.

558
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:17,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are nearing lunar orbit sir.

559
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:22,260


560
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:26,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's get ready to initiate landing procedure.

561
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:30,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Switch from autopilot to remote Astro please.

562
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:33,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am now in control of the ship and am prepared to land.

563
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Surface of the Moon here we come.

564
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:36,530


565
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}huh?!

566
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:41,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wha...

567
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wha... What was that?

568
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Night shade deactivated.

569
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Death Star!

570
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}B-Dawg it's the Moon.

571
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:57,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It looks a lot bigger up here than when we used to howl at it from home.

572
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:00,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aw goodness! All the blue cheese a fella can eat!

573
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:03,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are heading for it and fast. Buckle up guys.

574
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:06,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Restraint activated.

575

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa! Weird!
Wait this is unbelievable.

577
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:17,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I've lost control of the ship. - Talk to me.

578
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:22,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. Somehow the onboard vectra system
has overridden the remote pilot.

579
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:26,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}B-Dawg what are you doing?

580
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:31,330

581
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:34,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A thousand feet and gaining speed sir.

582
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:40,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If we don't get control soon and adjust our course the Vision One's a goner.

583
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:43,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who turned on the spin cycle?!

584
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:46,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Slats time? - 57 seconds till impact.

585
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:52,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're going in circles!

586

587
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:00,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is a highly advanced piloting system.

588
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:08,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- There we go. - Yeah I could've done that.

589
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just need a little practice that's all.

590
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:13,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was furry.

591
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good job Spudnick.

592
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:18,210

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa! Whoa! Yes I have control back.

595
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:26,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- How? - I have no idea sir.
I'm just going with it.

596
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:30,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something very strange is happening up there.

597
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:36,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK initiate lunar landing procedure.

602
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:56,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Astro easy. 100 and counting.

609
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:32,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow the Moon.

610
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:36,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buddies are you ready to go for the walk of your lives?

611
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:39,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good idea 'cause I've gotta take a whiz something fierce.

612
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:42,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well let's suit up.

613
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:49,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait a second. The system shows the airlock door is opening.

614
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Spudnick you go first.

615
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One small step for dog one giant leap for dogkind.

616
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:45,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sir you've gotta take a look at this.

617
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:49,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

618

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have no idea sir.

620
00:47:57,410 --> 00:48:00,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's some sort of four-legged creatures surrounding the ship.

621
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:04,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sir I think we've discovered alien life forms.

622
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:07,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK uh Chuck zoom in on that would ya?

623
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Roger.

624
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:13,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think it's cheese but I don't even care.

625
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:16,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the first time in my life I haven't been hungry.

626
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:19,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you buddies for making dreams come true.

627
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:23,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If they are extraterrestrial beings

628
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:26,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}why are they wearing Vision Enterprises spacesuits?

629
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Open up the communication line on their helmets.

630
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:47,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It appears we have canine stowaways?

631
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:51,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah so maybe Yuri wasn't so crazy after all.

632
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:54,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Those look like puppy puppies.

633
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:58,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And they're walking on the Moon.

634
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:04,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're walking on the Moon!

635
00:49:07,770 --> 00:49:12,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa! Amazing!

636
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:16,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Check it. I'm doing the moonwalk.

637
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:19,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Totally awesome.

638
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa! This is so cool.

639
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How does something like this happen?

640
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:00,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And more importantly how on earth are we going to bring them home?

641
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:04,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah leaving five puppies on the Moon it's not real good for PR.

642
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:06,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No it is certainly not.

643
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:08,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We could run an ad campaign.

644
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:10,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh. - Let me see.

645
00:50:10,290 --> 00:50:11,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fly with us

646
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:16,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we launched six poor innocent puppies into space

647
00:50:16,470 --> 00:50:19,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and then bid them farewell for eternity.

648
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The bottom line is we can't leave them there.

649
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:26,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do you plan on coaxing a bunch of moronic animals

650
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:31,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}into a spacecraft from 228536 miles away?

651
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:36,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's Buddha?

652
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:41,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Om.

653
00:50:56,130 --> 00:50:58,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A view that will change your perspective forever.

654
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:01,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is totally unreal.

655
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:06,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This one's for my boy Sasha.

656
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:09,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yo dogs I hate to crash the party but

657

658
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:18,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Galactic Canines do you read me?

659
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:22,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Does anyone else hear that? - Dogs I think I hear an alien.

660
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:25,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dude there's no aliens.

661
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:28,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It must be Mission Control. They know we're here.

662
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm Gravity Mission Commander's assistant.

663
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:33,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who are you doglings and how in the universe

664
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}did you get on board the Vision One?

665
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:38,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm dogmonaut Spudnick Russian Space Agency.

666
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:41,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And these are the buddies.
I got on at the Russian Space Station.

667
00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:44,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These pups uh they saved my life.

668
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:46,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got on at Vision Headquarters.

669
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:48,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A field trip gone awry.

670
00:51:48,850 --> 00:51:51,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dogs listen I can help you get back to Earth.

671
00:51:51,350 --> 00:51:55,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dude are we over-stoked to hear a voice from home.

672
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:58,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Vision One will be departing for Earth in 15 minutes and 32 seconds.

673
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:01,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So head back to the spaceship before your oxygen is depleted

674
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:03,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and get ready for lunar lift off.

675
00:52:06,550 --> 00:52:10,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Until we get the puppies home safely

676
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:12,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we keep this quiet. OK?

677
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:15,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean I need full confidentiality on this. If this story were to leak

678
00:52:15,210 --> 00:52:18,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it would spread like wildfire and that would cause irreparable damage

679
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:21,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to Vision Enterprises.

680
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:27,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh guys guys! The uh d-dogs are going back on board.

681
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:32,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's launch before they decide to go exploring again.

682
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:42,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right people we know the drill.

683
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:45,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Boosters are a go V-1 is a go for lunar launch.

684
00:52:52,410 --> 00:52:54,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Robot arm activated.

685
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Time to bring home a souvenir.

686
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Preparing to launch.

687
00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:10,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ready to launch sir.

688
00:53:10,350 --> 00:53:12,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We will be out of communication with you

689
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:14,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for approximately 12 minutes

690
00:53:14,350 --> 00:53:16,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}while you circle the backside of the Moon.

691
00:53:31,450 --> 00:53:33,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right we're back in business.

692
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:35,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now let's get these puppies safely home.

693
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:45,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're live at Vision Enterprises where quite a tale is unfolding.

694
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:47,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It seems that five golden retriever puppies

695
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:50,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}have been accidentally launched into space.

696
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:53,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom!

697
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:54,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Along with a bull terrier they are going

698
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:57,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- where no dog has gone before. - What?

699
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:11,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is believed the pups rendezvoused

700
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:14,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with the Russian dogmonaut

701
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:18,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}at the long-thought destroyed Russian Research Space Station.

702
00:54:18,330 --> 00:54:19,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Wow! - They made history

703
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:23,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}by being the first animals to walk on the Moon.

704
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Spudnick!

705
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:41,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know I have no idea how these guys could have gotten a hold of this.

706
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:44,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hackers these days.

707
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:47,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Probably got into the system and jacked our video feed.

708
00:54:47,170 --> 00:54:49,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's very off-putting.

709
00:54:59,710 --> 00:55:02,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Come on guys. - Live for KTLA

710
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:05,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm Doug... - Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
Where do you think you're going?

711
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:09,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're here to talk about our pups that you guys shot into space.

712
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:11,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Absolutely no one gets through.

713
00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:14,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then we'll go talk to the newsman instead.

714
00:55:14,470 --> 00:55:17,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Satellite is up in 8 seconds. - Hang on a second.

715
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:19,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We have a live wire. - Dr. Finkel?

716
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:23,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have a bunch of kids here
that claim the alleged puppies in space are their dogs.

717
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:24,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought you'd like to know.

718
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:27,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-  Send them in. - Yes sir.

719
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:30,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dr. Finkel would like to have a word with you.

720

00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:49,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}by launching their puppies up into space.

725
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:51,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As you can imagine they're quite traumatized.

726
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:57,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pi wow it's an honor to meet you sir.

00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:50,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the only way to fix it

00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:52,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is for an astronaut to do it externally.

00:59:56,090 --> 00:59:59,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're gonna need one of you to do a spacewalk to fix the damage.

01:00:05,350 --> 01:00:08,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I should go. I've been in space the longest and know this stuff well.

01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:15,900

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was just gonna raise my paw.

01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:47,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well for the sake of those five kids...

01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:49,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...we cannot give up.

01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:53,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can't.

01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:33,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Move your right hind leg you go back.

01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:41,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look you'll be tethered to the ship

01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:43,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so you don't float off into outer space. Got it?

821
01:01:43,790 --> 01:01:46,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh which one is my left paw again?

01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:47,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're doomed.

01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:50,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? It's not my fault I'm dyslexic!

824
01:01:50,330 --> 01:01:53,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just remember your right back leg you lift to take a wizzo.

825
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:56,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Left back you use to scratch your tummy.

826
01:01:56,790 --> 01:01:59,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Left front paw you use to beg for food.

01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:02,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the right front paw is for snackin'.

01:02:02,550 --> 01:02:05,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK scratch forward. Wizzo equals backwards.

829
01:02:05,470 --> 01:02:08,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Begging go right and snacking go left.
See I got it.

01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:15,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Place it back into position
and we should be able to control the ship again.

832
01:02:15,310 --> 01:02:16,270


833
01:02:16,350 --> 01:02:19,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Budderball did you eat all the bean burritos?

01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:25,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And walking in space makes me especially nervous.

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh sweet mama. This is beautiful.

01:03:02,190 --> 01:03:04,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK now gently move forward.

840
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:06,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh how do I do that again?

01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:10,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh right!

843
01:03:16,870 --> 01:03:20,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All this talk about scratching and now I've got an itch.

844
01:03:20,710 --> 01:03:22,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Budderball don't scratch.

845
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:24,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But it's so itchy.

01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:29,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't help myself.

848
01:03:29,630 --> 01:03:31,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't do it dawg.

849
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:33,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Must scratch.

850
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:36,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Budderball no!
Oh mama. Ah!

851
01:03:36,230 --> 01:03:37,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah!

852
01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:40,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. Whoaah! Ah!

854
01:03:44,010 --> 01:03:45,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah! Ow!

855
01:03:49,530 --> 01:03:53,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In life sometimes you're the bug sometimes you're the windshield.

856
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:57,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did somebody catch the license plate on that UFO?

857
01:03:57,410 --> 01:03:59,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Quit messing around dude.

858
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go to the antenna.

859
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:12,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guys we have a problem.

860
01:04:12,550 --> 01:04:13,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not working.

861
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've got to be kidding dawg.

862
01:04:15,930 --> 01:04:18,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I swear. Cross my stomach and hope to starve.

863
01:04:18,770 --> 01:04:21,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The scratching episode used up all your fuel.

864
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:22,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now what are we gonna do?

865
01:04:22,770 --> 01:04:26,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got it! Budderball just ate a dozen bean burritos right?

866
01:04:26,270 --> 01:04:28,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dude this is no time to be cryptic.

867
01:04:28,570 --> 01:04:30,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're gonna have to pull his paw.

868
01:04:30,530 --> 01:04:32,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dawg he'll be asphyxiated.

869
01:04:32,570 --> 01:04:34,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Trust me I know what I'm doing.

870
01:04:35,630 --> 01:04:37,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Huh?

871
01:04:42,330 --> 01:04:44,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Robot arm engaged.

872
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:54,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Easy.

873
01:05:01,810 --> 01:05:05,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Whoa dudes. - Budderball are you with us?

874
01:05:05,150 --> 01:05:08,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know what you guys are complaining about.
It's really not that bad.

875
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:11,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK now the methane gas you just produced

876
01:05:12,070 --> 01:05:15,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}should give you enough fuel to fire up your jet pack.

877
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:17,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Budderball that little bit of fuel won't last.

878
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:19,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have to fix the antenna.

879
01:05:24,580 --> 01:05:26,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I see the problem.

880
01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:27,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK what does it look like?

881
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It kind of does a dog leg to the wizzo side.

882
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:32,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He means it's crooked to the right.

883
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:34,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See if you can move it back into position.

884
01:05:34,510 --> 01:05:36,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Roger that.

885
01:05:43,310 --> 01:05:44,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great news everybody.

886
01:05:44,810 --> 01:05:47,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Data communications has been restored to the ship.

887
01:05:47,650 --> 01:05:49,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Budderball you should be proud.

888
01:05:56,660 --> 01:05:59,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Data communication restored.

889
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:01,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Unbelievable. - She's back online.

890
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:03,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah!

891
01:06:06,370 --> 01:06:08,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's not uh celebrate too much here.

892
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:10,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We still have a ship to get back on course. Slats?

893
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Telemetry correction uplink underway sir.

894
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:18,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Firing thrusters course correction to 152.2 over 5.

895
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:21,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Vision One course correction confirmed sir.

896
01:06:21,390 --> 01:06:22,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK Slats?

897
01:06:22,850 --> 01:06:25,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Find out how we could have gotten so off course.

898
01:06:25,370 --> 01:06:28,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know sir.
Doesn't make any sense.

899
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:31,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We were on course to avoid the meteor shower.

900
01:06:31,690 --> 01:06:33,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The last print-out showed us right on track. Look!

901
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:39,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait a minute. The log shows an adjustment...

902
01:06:39,570 --> 01:06:42,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...made from the main terminal yesterday at 19:49.

903
01:06:44,580 --> 01:06:46,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Main terminal?

904
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:48,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was him!

905
01:06:49,630 --> 01:06:52,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hm? Excuse me.

906
01:06:56,510 --> 01:06:58,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please you can't be serious.

907
01:06:58,430 --> 01:07:01,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't think I would ever do such a thing?

908
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you sure Sam?

909
01:07:03,470 --> 01:07:05,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I saw him at the computer earlier.

910
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:07,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I knew he was up to something.

911
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:09,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh is that right?

912
01:07:09,270 --> 01:07:13,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pi you can't believe him over me.

913
01:07:13,110 --> 01:07:15,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's an ignorant child.

914
01:07:17,610 --> 01:07:20,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK then what's this?

915
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:26,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh I'm not...
I don't know what is. I've never seen that before.

916
01:07:26,290 --> 01:07:29,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's your USB key sir. - Please Karl don't speak.

917
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:30,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry sir.

918
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:40,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah! Hm. Security?
Can you give me playback of yesterday 19:49 hours of the main terminal?

919
01:07:40,470 --> 01:07:42,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Put it up in the Mission Control large screen.

920
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:44,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh and security you might want to join us.

921
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:46,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That won't be necessary.

922
01:07:46,810 --> 01:07:49,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh it's up on the big board now sir.

923
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:52,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good. Fast forward this.

924
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:54,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Freeze frame!

925
01:07:54,230 --> 01:07:56,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good now zoom in on that.

926
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:01,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I...

927
01:08:05,580 --> 01:08:08,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Darn! Karl!

928
01:08:08,340 --> 01:08:10,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh! - Security!

929
01:08:10,290 --> 01:08:12,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take Dr. Finkel away.

930
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:15,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bye-bye Dr. Stinkel.

931
01:08:15,130 --> 01:08:16,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's Finkel.

932
01:08:16,170 --> 01:08:18,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Finkel!

933
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:22,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Faster than you can say "Fetch" it brings me great delight

934
01:08:22,390 --> 01:08:24,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to let you that this mission is back on track.

935
01:08:39,150 --> 01:08:41,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have never been so hungry.

936
01:08:41,110 --> 01:08:44,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think I might have to actually eat that broccoli to stay alive.

937
01:08:46,330 --> 01:08:48,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Budderball?

938
01:08:55,630 --> 01:08:56,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is good.

939
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:03,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aw dude I can't believe you ate the whole thing.

940
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:06,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well I always said I'd eat broccoli when puppies fly.

941
01:09:08,890 --> 01:09:10,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

942
01:09:10,310 --> 01:09:13,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Excuse me Mr. Slats sir? - Yeah.

943
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:15,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's that approaching to Vision One?

944
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:21,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-  Warning! Warning!

945
01:09:22,070 --> 01:09:24,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Aw snap it just doesn't stop!

946
01:09:26,530 --> 01:09:28,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Unidentified object approaching Vision One.

947
01:09:28,950 --> 01:09:30,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whatever it is it's on a collision course with our spaceship.

948
01:09:30,950 --> 01:09:32,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Take evasive action! Stat!

949
01:09:32,950 --> 01:09:33,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Whoa whoa whoa whoa. OK.

950
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:42,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the Cosmopod Yuri.

951
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:44,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's gonna crash into us.

952
01:09:57,110 --> 01:10:00,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- American comrades this is Yuri. - Is that Yuri?

953
01:10:00,270 --> 01:10:02,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He must have had an escape pod.

954
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My Cosmopod is not irresponsible.

955
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:06,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Slats any ideas. - Negative sir.

956
01:10:06,450 --> 01:10:08,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Russian pod is out of control.

957
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:11,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's entering the atmosphere
at a dangerous entry level at high speed.

958
01:10:11,990 --> 01:10:14,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's pretty much an impossible rescue sir.

959
01:10:14,580 --> 01:10:18,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yuri will burn up if you don't change his trajectory.
