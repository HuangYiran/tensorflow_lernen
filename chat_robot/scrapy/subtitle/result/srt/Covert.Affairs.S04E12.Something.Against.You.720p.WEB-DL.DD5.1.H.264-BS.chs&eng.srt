你说过你继父会殴打你妈妈

你想要什么  海伦

166
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,230
我得隐蔽自己的行踪

能让我进去吗

当影子特工是你自己的选择

169
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,550
别指望我会帮你隐瞒

她跟亨利之间发生的每一件事

</b>if I'm gonna find any evidence to tie him to the attack

178
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,510
以此为亚瑟洗脱罪名

好了  你我之间永远不能谈及安妮

亚瑟和琼有让你帮忙吗
</b>Did Arthur and Joan even ask for your help,

184
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:24,440
还是你毛遂自荐

想以此将功补过

你说得没错

这七年来一刻都没放弃过

192
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,000
随着时间的流逝

193
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,570
我越来越清楚地意识到我犯下了大错

194
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:45,800
但我不能改变当初的决定

你以为你现在就能改变当初的决定吗

说得很清楚不是这么一回事

自从你舍弃海伦・汉森这身份
</b>You have not been my wife

200
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,920
伪装成他人那一刻起

201
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:56,080
你就不是我的妻子了

我不知道你是谁

你知道我花了多长时间才走出来吗
</b>Do you have any idea how long it took me to get over that?

207
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,410
到头来居然都是个弥天大谎

208
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:09,940
我能理解

275
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:22,250
你知道这些背景调查的原因吗
</b>Hey, what's with all these background checks?

276
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:27,120
最近把大家都弄得疑神疑鬼的
</b>There is an increasingly thick cloud of paranoia going around.

277
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:28,910
还以为只有我这么觉得呢
</b>You know, I thought it was just me.

278
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:29,860
不只是你
</b>It's not.

279
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,920
他们增添了新服务器来储存额外数据
</b>They're adding servers to hold extra data,

280
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:34,710
我还听说布雷斯怀特正在暗中
</b>And I heard Braithwaite opened a blue file

281
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,180
调查亨利・威尔库克斯

282
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:39,700
真的  好吧
</b>Really? Huh.

283
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,100
我还以为布雷斯怀特听命于威尔库克斯
</b>I thought Wilcox had Braithwaite in his pocket.

284
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,260
我也这么以为的
</b>I did too.

285
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:48,400
这事别跟别人说  行吗
</b>Hey, keep that one under your hat, all right?

286
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,050
放心  不会乱说的  哥们
</b>Yeah, it's under the hat, man.

287
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,150
一定守口如瓶

汤米  汤米

我们的流言计划进行得如何
</b>How'd it go with patient zero?

290
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:05,040
很快就会传到亨利和布雷斯怀特的耳里了
</b>One wedge between Henry and Braithwaite coming up.

291
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,120
至今我都不明白为什么一屋子的间谍们
</b>It still amazes me how bad a building full of spies

292
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,750
却守不住秘密
</b>is at keeping a secret.

293
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,180
什么时候能知道这个起作用了
</b>When will we know this is working?

294
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,890
但亨利找你谈话而不找布雷斯怀特的时候
</b>When Henry wants to talk to you instead of Braithwaite.

295
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:15,650
-他有什么情况通知我  -明白
</b>- Let me know when he reaches out. - Yeah.

296
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,450
有什么可以帮到你们吗

297
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:28,250
我们是来找戴维・都普瑞斯的

300
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,730
说是国际刑警
</b>They said they're with Interpol.

301
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,370
不可能  我从没见过那些文件

302
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:56,580
不好意思  你得跟我们走一趟

303
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,750
别碰我  我自己会走

304
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:03,460
-戴维  -是国际刑警
</b>- David? - Interpol.

305
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:04,670
他们要带我回办事处

询问一些有关我电脑里文件的问题

00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,340
他们怀疑我跟哥本哈根
</b>They think I had something to do

309
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,270
那架直升机坠落事件有关

310
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,770
这只是个误会

311
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:14,820
打给柯林的律所

312
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,100
让他去国际刑警办事处找我

洁西卡
</b>Jessica.

318
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:43,250
你说的一切都发生了
</b>Everything you said happened.

319
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,010
他们对戴维出手了

320
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,250
亨利是怎么做到的
</b>How did Henry do it?

321
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,130
他是怎么把文件放进戴维的电脑里的

322
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,710
不是亨利干的

323
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,380
是我

324
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:56,590
是我今早放进去的
</b>I loaded the files this morning.

325
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:59,230
你让国际刑警抓走了我的未婚夫

326
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:01,210
不  是亨利联系的国际刑警

327
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:03,530
这是他计划中的下一步
</b>It's the next logical phase in his plan.

328
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:06,770
一旦亨利发现安德鲁・古德曼已经死了
</b>Sana, as soon as Henry realizes Andrew Goodman is dead,

329
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:09,220
我们就什么都做不了了  桑娜
</b>there is nothing else we can do.

330
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,930
安德鲁本该为他把文件放进戴维电脑的
</b>He expected Andrew to plant that intel,

331
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,770
所以我这么做了
</b>So I did it.

332
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,650
虽然有一定的风险
</b>It's a calculated risk,

333
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:18,490
但只要真相一大白  戴维就会没事的

334
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:19,920
你说过你在制定计划的

335
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,720
我想我们在你行动之前最好讨论讨论

你说过你不想向戴维撒谎
</b>You said you had a hard time lying to David,

337
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:27,360
所以我避免了让你再次那么做

我在试图证明

亨利才是哥本哈根袭击案的幕后黑手
</b>that Henry is the architect of the Copenhagen attacks.

342
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,130
我们在"跟着钱走"
</b>We are following the money.

343
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,370
找出亨利是如何转移现金的
</b>finding out how Henry moves his cash

344
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:40,350
是还戴维自由之身的第一步

345
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,830
而我有办法能让我们做成这件事

346
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,300
在这之前戴维一直都是自由之身

347

亨利是你儿子死亡的原因

炸弹爆炸时我在场

杰和我在一个小餐馆见面

我本应和他一起上车的

但是我忘了拿我的雨伞

353
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:13,500
就在那时炸弹爆炸了

354
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,820
是亨利做的

355
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,970
他告诉了你什么
</b>What did he tell you?

356

他说这是亚瑟・坎贝尔的错

357
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:22,440
还说很快全世界就会知道真相了

358
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,390
而且他很生气
</b>And he was angry.

359
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:25,870
那不是生气
</b>It wasn't anger.

360
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,890
而是愧疚
</b>It was guilt.

361
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:31,410
那个放炸弹的男人是一位前特工

362
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,450
而亨利背弃了他

亨利将他对杰的死亡的愧疚

368
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,270
你想要我做什么

369
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:57,250
我们得找个私密点的地方

让他等着

你以为这能让他放下戒备

但这么做并不英明

是我打过去的

你只需要和他谈一小会儿
</b>You only have to talk to him for a little while.

468
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,760
之后我会给亨利设一个陷阱
</b>Then I'm gonna throw a wrench into Henry's world,

469
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,300

474
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,140
离开他的视线

475
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,230
人们管那叫做"迷恋"

476
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:10,250
我认为那是因为他擅长操控别人

这些特质你都没有

479
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:16,790
他会和我反复演练一个场景

480
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,070
直到我感觉安全

481
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:20,260
他有那么多时间

482

还有中情局在背后支持他

我们没有那些资源

00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:05,610
他会不惜一切来达到这个目的
</b>and he will do anything to make that happen,

551
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:07,000
包括买通安德鲁
</b>including paying off Andrew.

552
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:10,820
<b>安德鲁・古德曼
三小时内给我三百万美元
否则我会告诉桑娜所有事情</b>

553
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,850
他一旦汇款  我们就能跟踪资金流向
</b>Once he wires the money, we can track the flow

554
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:13,520
找到他的同伙
</b>and find out who he's working with,

555
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:15,830
并能把他和我们红头发的朋友联系起来
</b>and it links him to our red-haired friend.

556
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,490
这样做很投机
</b>This feels speculative.

557
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:18,770
这只是冰山一角
</b>It's just breadcrumbs.

558
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:21,320
如果发挥作用就不是冰山一角了
</b>It's always just breadcrumbs until it becomes something more.

559
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,210
你懂得

560

561
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:31,250
我们要激怒他
</b>We're getting a rise out of him.

562
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,160
你到底想干什么
</b>So what the hell are you doing?

563
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:38,140
你要明白你只是一颗棋子
</b>You realize I--I put you into this game we play,

564
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,770
我可以把你弃掉
</b>and I can pluck you out.

565
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,300
你不想让维尔莉特
</b>I'm sure you wouldn't want anything

566
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,120
出什么事吧
</b>to happen to Violet, would you?

567
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:47,080
你知道维尔莉特是谁吗
</b>Do you know who Violet is?

568
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,780
不知道
</b>No.

569
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:57,160
<b>安德鲁・古德曼

时间不多了

576
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,570
接收帐户都准备好了吗
</b>Is the receiving account all set?

577
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:58,490
我通过瑞士金融市场监督管理局
</b>I fabricated a dummy account for Goodman

578
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:00,010
为古德曼伪造了一个虚拟账户

579

并加上了必要的电子标签

580
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:01,930
他一旦汇款

581
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:04,260
我们就能找到资金来源

很难说准

不过他们找到他至少有一天了

就是说这没有成功

我还以为这咖啡是一份谢罪礼

658
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:49,170
原来是贿赂啊

这上面还有谁陪你吗

没有  只有我

你有戴维的消息吗

你能想办法跟你的国际刑警朋友打个招呼吗

桑娜  我不是有意要让这听起来很冷漠  但

701
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,090

你是不是完全忽略了他可能有罪的

703
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,630
可能性

704
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:32,070
我们都不了解自以为了解的人

705
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:37,850
甚至是那些我们爱的人

706
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:42,370
为什么我感觉我们说的已经不是戴维了

昨天有一个短暂的瞬间

708

和以往一样坐在一起吃午餐

713

但那不是爱

714
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:09,110
是背叛

715
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,090
你背叛了我

你吓到我了  亨利

洁西卡・马修斯是个坏影响

说服你帮助她一起敲诈我

这是威胁还是敲诈

730

你只有两个选择
