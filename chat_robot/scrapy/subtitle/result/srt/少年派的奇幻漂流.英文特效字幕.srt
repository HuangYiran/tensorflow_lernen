00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you were raised in a zoo?

3
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Born and raised.

00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In Pondicherry, in what was the French part of India.

5
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My father owned the zoo...

00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:11,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I was delivered on short notice by a herpetologist...

7
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:14,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}who was there to check on the Bengal monitor lizard.

8
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mother and I were both healthy...

9
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but the poor lizard escaped...

10
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and was trampled by a frightened cassowary.

11
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The way of karma, huh?

12
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The way of God.

13
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's quite a story.

14
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I had assumed your father was a mathematician because of your name.

15
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:38,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Far from it, I was named after a swimming pool.

16
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There is a swimming pool named "Pi"?

17
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see, my uncle Francis was born

18
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with too much water in his lungs.

19
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:52,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They say the doctors swung Francis around by the ankles to clear the water out...

00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and that's what gave him the huge chest and skinny legs...

21
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that made him such a great swimmer.

22
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:00,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is Francis actually your uncle?

23
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He said he was friends with your father.

24
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:05,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's my honorary uncle, I call him Mamaji.

25
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My father's best friend, my swimming guru.

26
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I trained with him three times a week at the ashram.

27
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:14,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His lessons would save my life in the end.

28
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A mouthful of water will not harm you, but panic will.

29
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember to breathe now, don't hold your breath.

30
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good boy.

31
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hope you don't mind vegetarian.

32
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no. Not at all.

33
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And your name? Huh?

34
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were going to tell me how you got your name, I think.

35
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:43,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yes. I got it from something Mamaji once told my father.

36
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see, most travelers collect postcards or teacups on their journeys...

37
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but not Mamaji.

38
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mamaji collects swimming pools.

39
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He swims in every pool he comes upon.

40
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,070


41
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:03,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One day, Mamaji said to my father that,

42
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}of all the pools in the world...

43
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the most beautiful was a public pool in Paris.

44
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:13,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That the water there was so clear, you could make your morning coffee with it.

45
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That a single swim there changed his life.

46
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Before I was born, he said...

47
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"If you want your son to have a clean soul...

48
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:39,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you must take him one day to swim in the Piscine Molitor."

49
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I never understood why my father took this so much to heart.

50
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:49,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But he did, and I was named "Piscine Molitor Patel."

51
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:52,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Imagine me trying to explain that name.

52
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:55,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I barely made it to the age of 11 before...

53
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Piscine!

54
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:01,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you pissing right now?

55
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at him, he's pissing!

56
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:07,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With one word, my name went from an elegant French swimming pool...

57
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to a stinking Indian latrine.

58
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was "Pissing" everywhere.

59
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No Pissing in the schoolyard!

60
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Even the teachers started doing it.

61
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not deliberately, of course.

62
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:23,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, then, what might occur if we release gas too quickly?

63
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pissing?

64
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He said "Pissing."

65
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's enough! Order! Order!

66
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:38,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When we returned the next year for our first day of school,

67
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was prepared.

68
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Present, sir.

69

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Piscine Patel.

70
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:53,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good morning. I am Piscine Molitor Patel.

00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Known to all as...

72
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:59,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pi, the sixteenth letter of the Greek alphabet...

73
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:03,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}which is also used in mathematics to represent the ratio...

74
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:07,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}of any circle's circumference to its diameter.

00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}An irrational number of infinite length,

00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:16,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}usually rounded to three digits as 3.14.

77
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pi.

78
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Very impressive, Pi. Now, sit down.

79
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And from then on, you were "Pi"?

80
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, no, not quite.

81
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nice try, Pissing.

82
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:38,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I still had the whole day ahead of me.

83
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}French class was next.

84
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Je m'appelle Piscine Molitor Patel.

85
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dit Pi.

86
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:48,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then, geography.

87
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These are the first 20 decimal places of pi.

88
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My last class of the day was mathematics.

89
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Slowly, slowly, slowly.

90
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:11,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}3、7、5、8、9
Three. Seven. Five. Eight. Nine.

00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's right. He's really doing this.

93
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pi! Pi! Pi!

94
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:27,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}By the end of that day, I was Pi Patel, school legend.

95
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:32,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Um, Mamaji tells me you're a legend among sailors, too.

96
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:33,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Out there, all alone.

97
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:36,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I don't even know how to sail.

98
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I wasn't alone out there. Richard Parker was with me.

00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Richard Parker?

00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mamaji didn't tell me everything.

101
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He just said I should look you up when I got back to Montreal.

102
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:49,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, what were you doing in Pondicherry?

103
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Writing a novel.

104
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}By the way, I enjoyed your first book.

105
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, this new one, is it set in India?

106
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, Portugal, actually. But it's cheaper living in India.

107
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:05,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah, well, I look forward to reading it.

108
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't.

109
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I threw it out.

110
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two years trying to bring this thing to life...

111
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:14,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and then one day, it sputtered, coughed and died.

112
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I'm sorry.

113
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:24,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh, I was sitting in this coffee house in Pondicherry one afternoon, mourning my loss...

114
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when this old man at the table next to me struck up a conversation.

115
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, Mamaji, he does that.

116
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When I told him about my abandoned book, he said...

117
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:36,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"So, a Canadian who's come to French India in search of a story."

118
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:39,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Well, my friend, I know an Indian in French Canada...

119
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with the most incredible story to tell."

120
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:46,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"It must be fate that the two of you should meet."

121
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:53,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I haven't spoken about Richard Parker in so many years.

122
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, what has Mamaji already told you?

123
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:59,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He said you had a story that would make me believe in God.

124
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He would say that about a nice meal.

125
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:07,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As for God, I can only tell you my story.

126
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You will decide for yourself what you believe.

127
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fair enough.

128
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:16,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's see, then. Where to begin?

129
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:21,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pondicherry is the French Riviera of India.

130
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In the streets closest to the ocean,

131
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:30,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you might think you were in the south of France.

132
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A few blocks inland, there's a canal.

133
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just beyond that is Indian Pondicherry.

134
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the Muslim quarter is just to the west.

135
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:46,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When the French handed Pondicherry back to us in 1954...

136
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:50,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the town decided that some sort of commemoration was in order.

137
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My father, who was a clever businessman, came up with one.

138
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:57,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He ran a hotel, and he got the idea to open a zoo...

139
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in the local botanical gardens instead.

140
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:07,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As it also happened, my mother was a botanist in the gardens.

141
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:11,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They met, married, and a year later my brother Ravi was born.

142
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I came two years after that.

143
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It sounds magical, growing up in...

144
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Amen.

145
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, let's eat.

146
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't know Hindus said "amen."

147
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:31,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Catholic Hindus do.

148
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:32,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Catholic Hindus?

149
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We get to feel guilty before hundreds of gods, instead of just one.

150
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you're a Hindu first?

151
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:43,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}None of us knows God until someone introduces us.

152
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was first introduced to God as a Hindu.

153
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There are 33 million gods in the Hindu religion.

154
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:51,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How can I not come to know a few of them?

155
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:56,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I met Krishna first.

156
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yashoda once accused baby Krishna of eating dirt.

157
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:05,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Tut, tut you naughty boy - you shouldn't do that."

158
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:08,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But he didn't!

159
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what he told her.

160
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"I didn't eat dirt."

161
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yashoda said, "No? Well then..."

162
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Open your mouth."

163
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So Krishna opened his mouth.

164
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:24,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And what do you think Yashoda saw?

165
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

166
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:33,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She saw in Krishna's mouth the whole entire universe.

167
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The gods were my superheroes growing up.

168
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hanuman, the monkey god...

169
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}lifting an entire mountain to save his friend Lakshman.

170
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ganesh, the elephant-headed...

171
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:17,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}risking his life to defend the honor of his mother, Parvati.

172
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:22,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Vishnu, the supreme soul, the source of all things.

173
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Vishnu sleeps, floating on the shoreless cosmic ocean...

174
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:29,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and we are the stuff of his dreaming.

175
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:33,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Spectacle.

176
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:37,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't let these stories and pretty lights fool you, boys.

177
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:42,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Religion is darkness.

178
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:47,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My dear appa believed himself part of the new India.

179
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As a child, he had had polio.

180
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:55,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He used to lie in bed racked with pain, wondering where God was.

181
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:00,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In the end, God didn't save him, Western medicine did.

182
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My amma went to college...

183
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and thought her family was part of the new India as well...

184
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}until her parents cut her off...

185
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because they thought she was marrying beneath her.

186
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:17,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Her religion was the only link she had to her past.

187
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:30,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I met Christ in the mountains when I was 12.

188
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We were visiting relatives, tea growers in Munnar.

189
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:39,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was our third day there. Ravi and I were terribly bored.

190
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:42,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Challenge. I'll give you two rupees.

191
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:45,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Run in to that church and drink the holy water.

192
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You must be thirsty.

193
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here.

194
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:33,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I brought you this.

195
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why would a god do that?

196
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why would He send His own son...

197
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:57,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to suffer for the sins of ordinary people?

198
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:59,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because He loves us.

199
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}God made Himself approachable to us, human,

200
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:05,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so we could understand Him.

201
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:08,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can't understand God in all His perfection.

202
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But we can understand God's son and His suffering

203
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}as we would a brother's.

204
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:16,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That made no sense.

205
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:20,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sacrificing the innocent to atone for the sins of the guilty...

206
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What kind of love is that?

207
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But this son...

208
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I couldn't get him out of my head.

209
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If God is so perfect and we are not...

210
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}why would He want to create all this?

211
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why does He need us at all?

212
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:44,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All you have to know is that He loves us.

213
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}God so loved this world that He gave His only son.

214
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The longer I listened to the priest...

215
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:53,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the more I came to like this son of God.

216
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you, Vishnu, for introducing me to Christ.

217
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:07,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I came to faith through Hinduism

218
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I found God's love through Christ.

219
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:12,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But God wasn't finished with me yet.

220
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}God works in mysterious ways.

221
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And so it was, He introduced Himself again.

222
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:30,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This time by the name of Allah.

223
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Allahu Akbar.

224
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My Arabic was never very good...

225
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:56,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but the sound and feel of the words brought me closer to God.

226
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In performing Salah...

227
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the ground I touched became holy ground...

228
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:03,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I found a feeling of serenity and brotherhood.

229
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This lamb is exquisite.

230
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the best dish on the table.

231
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're all missing out.

232
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:25,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You only need to convert to three more religions, Piscine...

233
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you will spend your life on holiday.

234
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you going to Mecca this year, Swami Jesus?

235
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or to Rome for your coronation as Pope Pi-us?

236
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You stay out of this, Ravi.

237
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just as you like cricket, Pi has his own interests.

238
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, Gita, Ravi has a point.

239
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:47,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You cannot follow three different religions at the same time, Piscine.

240
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why not?

241
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:52,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because believing in everything at the same time...

242
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is the same as not believing in anything at all.

243
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:59,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's young, Santosh. He's still finding his way.

244
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And how can he find his way if he does not choose a path?

245
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:07,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, instead of leaping from one religion to the next...

246
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:10,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}why not start with reason?

247
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In a few hundred years...

248
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}science has taken us farther in understanding the universe...

249
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}than religion has in 10,000.

250
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is true.

251
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:22,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your father is right.

252
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:26,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Science can teach us more about what is out there...

253
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but not what is in here.

254
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some eat meat, some eat vegetable.

255
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:34,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I do not expect us all to agree about everything...

256
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:38,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I would much rather have you believe in something I don't agree with...

257
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:41,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}than to accept everything blindly.

258
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:45,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that begins with thinking rationally.

259
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you understand?

260
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good.

261
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I would like to be baptized.

262
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:09,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, you're a Christian and a Muslim?

263
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And a Hindu, of course.

264
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And a Jew, I suppose.

265
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I do teach a course on the Kabbalah at the university.

266
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:18,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And why not? Faith is a house with many rooms.

267
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But no room for doubt?

268
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, plenty. On every floor.

269
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Doubt is useful.

270
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:25,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It keeps faith a living thing.

271
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:29,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After all, you cannot know the strength of your faith until it's been tested.

272
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:36,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's Selvam? We shouldn't be in here without him.

273
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:37,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop worrying.

274
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:42,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have seen him do this a thousand times.

275
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want to meet our new tiger.

276
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pi!

277
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:52,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello? Richard Parker?

278
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:55,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A tiger? Richard Parker was a tiger?

279
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, he got his name through a clerical error.

280
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:02,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A hunter caught him drinking from a stream when he was a cub...

281
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:04,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and named him Thirsty.

282
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When Thirsty got too big, the hunter sold him to our zoo...

283
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but the names got switched on the paperwork.

284
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:12,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The hunter was listed as Thirsty,

285
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:14,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and the tiger was called Richard Parker.

286
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:18,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We laughed about it, and the name stuck.

287
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go...

288
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}before we get into trouble.

289
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:25,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want to see him close up.

290
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:27,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not a zookeeper.

291
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:29,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on!

292
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's it, Richard Parker.

293
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's for you.

294
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:21,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

295
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:25,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you thinking?

296
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you out of your mind?

297
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who gave you permission to come back here?

298
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:32,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have just ignored everything I've ever taught you.

299
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:36,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just wanted to say hello to him.

300
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think that tiger is your friend?

301
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:41,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's an animal, not a playmate.

302
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Animals have souls.

303
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have seen it in their eyes.

304
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Find Selvam.

305
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:04,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're sure, Sir? Pi's just a boy.

306
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do it. Go ahead!

307
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Animals do not think like we do.

308
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:13,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}People who forget that get themselves killed.

309
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:17,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That tiger is not your friend.

310
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When you look into his eyes...

311
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:23,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you are seeing your own emotions reflected back at you.

312
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:25,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing else.

313
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't be stupid. Say you're sorry.

314
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What have you done, Piscine?

315
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what your father said about coming back here.

316
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am sorry. I was...

317
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you thinking?

318
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:41,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is between a father and his sons.

319
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He said he's sorry.

320
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want to scar them for life?

321
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:49,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Scar them? That boy almost lost his arm.

322
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But he's still a boy.

323
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:52,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He will be a man sooner than you think.

324
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:55,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And this is a lesson I do not want them ever to forget.

325
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Selvam!

326
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:48,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and so has placed the country in a state of emergency.

327
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:52,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Under the directive, the states of Gujarat and Tamil Nadu...

328
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:55,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}will be placed under the direct authority of the central government.

329
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:57,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Police will be granted powers...

330
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:02,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to arrest and indefinitely detain citizens responsible for the uprising.

331
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:09,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Things changed after the day of Appa's lesson.

332
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:12,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The world had lost some of its enchantment.

333
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:16,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}School was a bore. Nothing but facts, fractions and French.

334
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Words and patterns that went on and on, without end.

335
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just like my irrational nickname.

336
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,270


337
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I grew restless searching for something

338
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:34,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that might bring meaning back into my life.

339
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:38,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then, I met Anandi.

340
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mother made me study music.

341
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And one day, my teacher came down with the flu.

342
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:56,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He asked if I could take his place, playing rhythms for a dance class.

343
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

344
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you do not concentrate...

345
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:18,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you cannot express your love of God through dance.

346
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Feel the ground beneath your feet.

347
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Open your gaze out onto the horizon.

348
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:28,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let that spiritual energy pulse through you and out into the world.

349
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Through abhinaya.

350
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:33,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anandi, come to the front. Lead them.

351
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:20,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are you following me?

352
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:21,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

353
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were following me.

354
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:29,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What does this mean?

355
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In the dance, you went from pataka...

356
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}which means the forest.

357
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then you did...

358
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}samputa...

359
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:44,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}which means something that is hidden.

360
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And after that, you did this.

361
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then you did chatura.

362
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:53,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But at the very end, you did this.

363
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}None of the other dancers did that.

364
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did you mean? The god of love is hiding in the forest?

365
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:03,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, that also means the lotus flower.

366
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lotus flower is hiding in the forest?

367
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:10,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why would a lotus flower hide in the forest?

368
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And this is Richard Parker.

369
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He is the most magnificent creature we've ever had here.

370
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at the way he's turning his head.

371
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Showing off. Like a dancer.

372
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:35,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, he heard something.

373
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:40,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's listening, you see?

374
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:51,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have talked about it for some time.

375
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you understand what I'm saying?

376
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:55,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pi?

377
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, you've been...

378
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Worried.

379
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For my family.

380
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:05,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our animals are worth far more abroad than here in India.

381
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And if the town council stops supporting us...

382
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know where we will be.

383
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:12,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, it is what we have to do.

384
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you understand?

385
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:19,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, what are we talking about?

386
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:21,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are leaving India.

387
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

388
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:28,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are selling the zoo.

389
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The zoo was never ours to sell. The land belongs to the town.

390
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But the animals are ours and if we sell them...

391
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we will have enough to start a new life.

392
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:40,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But where would we go? Our life is here, Appa.

393
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:41,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Canada.

394
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:44,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have some opportunities for work in Winnipeg.

395
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:47,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll be shipping most of the animals for sale in North America.

396
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:49,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can get freighter passage for the whole family.

397
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:51,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So...

398
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is settled.

399
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:56,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We will sail like Columbus.

400
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:59,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But Columbus was looking for India.

401
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:10,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It takes a lot of work to sell a zoo.

402
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Before we left...

403
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:16,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anandi and I had time enough to break each other's hearts.

404
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:20,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course, I promised I would come back one day.

405
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's funny.

406
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:25,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I remember everything else about our last day.

407
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:29,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I don't remember saying goodbye.

408
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:41,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pi? They're serving dinner below.

409
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Piscine...

410
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you have a whole life ahead of you.

411
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:02,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are doing this for you and Ravi.

412
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:06,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come inside and have some dinner.

413
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:17,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Vegetarian, please.

414
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my sons and I are vegetarians. Do you have anything...

415
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:25,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no. Not more gravy.

416
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You don't want gravy?       - No.

417
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I want something vegetarian.

418
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:35,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pas de problème.

419
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:41,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She asked if you have something vegetarian.

420
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:46,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The cow that produced this liver was vegetarian,

421
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:49,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the pigs that went into these sausages were vegetarian.

422
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:50,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Very funny.

423
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:54,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But my wife doesn't eat liver.

424
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pas de problème.

425
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:02,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then she can eat the sausage, the rice, and the gravy.

426
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or you can cook your own food.

427
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:07,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Haw dare you talk to my wife like that?

428
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here's your rice.

429
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:14,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I cook for sailors...

430
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:15,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}not curry-eaters.

431
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did you say?

432
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let go of me!

433
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:22,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who do you think you are? You're nothing but a servant!

434
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I feed people! You feed monkeys!

435
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello.

436
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:36,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am happy Buddhist.

437
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:40,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, I eat rice next to gravy.

438
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:44,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}On ship, gravy is not meat.

439
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is taste.

440
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You try?

441
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry.

442
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:17,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We will have plenty of fresh supplies after we stop in Manila.

443
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:23,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why give Orange Juice tranquilizers?

444
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:26,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's not going to cause any trouble.

445
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:29,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The stress of traveling is not good for the animals...

446
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and it helps with the seasickness.

447
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:39,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't want to be cleaning up after a seasick orangutan...

448
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}do we?

449
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:50,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My father was a businessman.

450
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:52,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He had never tended the animals himself.

451
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I realized...

452
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:59,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}leaving India must have been harder for him than it was for me.

453
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:06,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So...

454
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have I forgotten anything?

455
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think you've set the stage.

456
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:14,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So far, we have an Indian boy named after a French swimming pool...

457
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}on a Japanese ship full of animals, heading to Canada.

458
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

459
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, we have to send our boy into the middle of the Pacific and...

460
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And make me believe in God.

461
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

462
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:31,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll get there.

463
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was four days out of Manila...

464
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:43,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}above the Mariana Trench, the deepest spot on Earth.

465
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our ship, The Tsimtsum, pushed on,

466
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:51,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}bullishly indifferent to its surroundings.

467
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:57,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It moved with the slow, massive confidence of a continent.

468
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ravi?

469
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you hear that, Ravi?

470
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sleeping.

471
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a thunderstorm. Let's go watch.

472
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:41,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you crazy?

473
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We will get hit by lightning.

474
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:47,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, we won't. It will hit the bridge first.

475
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:51,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't tempt a storm, Pi.

476
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:58,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}More rain! More rain!

477
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lord of Storms!

487
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,350

00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:53,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Put this on.

489
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:56,390

493
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:06,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who let all the animals out?

494
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have to go now!

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bring it down!

499
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey! You! What are you doing?

00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:14,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Looks as though your drugs haven't worn off yet.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Welcome to Pi's Ark.

514
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:16,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where is your boy, Orange Juice?

515
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:30,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry, I bet mother and father found him.

516
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They'll all be here soon.

517
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:47,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello!

518
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:53,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello!

519
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:58,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anybody!

520
00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:02,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

521
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:07,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop it! No! Stop it! Stop it!

522
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:11,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! No!

523
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:02,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, Orange Juice.

524
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't have any seasickness medicine for you.

525
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:10,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Supplies. Oh, supplies!

526
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,990


527
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,470


528
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:20,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes! Yes!

529
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:31,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! No!

530

533
00:57:41,790 --> 00:57:44,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My name is Pi Patel.

534
00:57:44,710 --> 00:57:47,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have been in a shipwreck.

535
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:50,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am on a lifeboat alone...

536
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with a tiger.

537
00:57:56,050 --> 00:57:58,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please send help.

538
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:49,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}God, I give myself to you.

539
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am your vessel.

540
00:59:54,670 --> 00:59:58,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whatever comes, I want to know.

541
01:00:00,510 --> 01:00:02,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Show me.

542
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:10,510


543
01:00:11,850 --> 01:00:14,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There are no lines.

544
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:23,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Set your house in order and dig in for the battle to survive.

545
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:28,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Establish a strict schedule for eating, keeping watch and getting rest.

546
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:32,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do not drink urine or sea water.

547
01:00:34,210 --> 01:00:38,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keep busy but avoid unnecessary exertion.

548
01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:43,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The mind can be kept occupied by playing card games...

549
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:47,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Twenty Questions, or! Spy.

550
01:00:49,890 --> 01:00:54,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Community singing is another surefire way to lift the spirits.

551
01:00:56,770 --> 01:00:59,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Telling stories is highly recommended.

552
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:06,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Above all, don't lose hope.

553
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:19,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Few things can sap the spirit faster than seasickness.

554
01:01:20,590 --> 01:01:25,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Waves are most strongly felt when a boat turns sideways to the current.

555
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:29,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A sea anchor is used as a drag to keep the boat's head to the wind.

556
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:32,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Proper use of them can increase control

557
01:01:32,930 --> 01:01:35,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and reduce seasickness during rough seas.

558
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:41,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For castaways who must share their lifeboats with large, dangerous carnivores...

559
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:44,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it's advisable to establish a territory as your own.

560
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:46,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Try this method.

561
01:01:46,490 --> 01:01:47,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Step one.

562
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:50,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Choose a day when waves are moderate, but regular.

563
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:54,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Step two. With the lifeboat facing into the waves...

564
01:01:54,290 --> 01:01:58,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}making the ride as comfortable as possible, blow your whistle soothingly.

565
01:01:59,130 --> 01:02:02,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Step three. Turn the lifeboat sideways to the waves...

566
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:05,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}accompanied by harsh, aggressive use of the whistle.

567
01:02:06,010 --> 01:02:07,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With sufficient repetition...

568
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:09,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the animal will associate the sound of the whistle...

569
01:02:10,010 --> 01:02:12,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with the discomfort of seasickness.

570
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:16,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Similar methods have long been used by circus trainers...

571
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:19,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}though they generally lack access to rough seas.

572
01:02:20,020 --> 01:02:22,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let the trumpets blare!

573
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:26,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let the drum rolls begin!

574
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:30,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Prepare to be amazed!

575
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:34,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here it is, for your enjoyment and instruction!

576
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:39,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The show you've been waiting for all your life...

577
01:02:39,670 --> 01:02:42,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}will soon begin!

578
01:02:44,210 --> 01:02:46,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you ready for the miracle of it?

579
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:50,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, then, I give to you...

580
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:55,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the astounding Bengal tiger!

581
01:03:05,530 --> 01:03:10,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello, Richard Parker. Sorry about the choppy ride.

582
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:49,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mine! You understand? Yours, mine!

583
01:03:52,450 --> 01:03:54,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You understand?

584
01:04:06,590 --> 01:04:08,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Step four.

585
01:04:08,260 --> 01:04:11,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Disregard steps one through three.

586
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:43,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here, Richard Parker. I got some water for you.

587
01:04:57,810 --> 01:05:02,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In the zoo, we fed our tigers an average of five kilos of meat a day.

588
01:05:02,890 --> 01:05:06,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Richard Parker will be getting hungry soon.

589
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:11,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tigers are powerful swimmers, and if he gets hungry enough...

590
01:05:11,650 --> 01:05:15,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm afraid the little bit of water between us won't be any protection.

591
01:05:16,030 --> 01:05:18,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need to find a way to feed him.

592
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:22,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can eat the biscuits but God made tigers carnivores...

593
01:05:22,330 --> 01:05:24,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so I must learn to catch fish.

594
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:27,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I don't, I'm afraid his last meal

595
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:29,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}will be a skinny, vegetarian boy.

596
01:05:39,510 --> 01:05:41,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Patience!

597
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:49,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What am I doing?

598
01:08:07,540 --> 01:08:10,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait! I'm thinking.

599
01:09:40,130 --> 01:09:42,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thirty-two cartons of biscuits.

600
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:47,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ninety-three cans of water.

601
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:01,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.

602
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:05,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.

603
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:10,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you, Lord Vishnu.

604
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:14,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you for coming in the form of a fish and saving our lives.

605
01:11:15,890 --> 01:11:17,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

606
01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:28,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course, I brought all the biscuits and water

607
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:31,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}on the raft with me to keep them safe.

608
01:13:32,070 --> 01:13:33,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Idiot.

609
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:40,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hunger can change everything you ever thought you knew about yourself.

610
01:14:30,590 --> 01:14:32,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here, it's yours!

611
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:43,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mine! Mine!

612
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:53,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't risk my life every time I have to climb onto the boat for supplies.

613
01:16:53,850 --> 01:16:56,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's time to settle this.

614
01:16:56,270 --> 01:16:58,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If we're going to live together,

615
01:16:58,150 --> 01:17:00,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we have to learn to communicate.

616
01:17:00,860 --> 01:17:03,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe Richard Parker can't be tamed,

617
01:17:03,570 --> 01:17:06,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but with God's will, he can be trained.

618
01:18:16,310 --> 01:18:17,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

619
01:18:25,990 --> 01:18:27,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good.

620
01:19:46,690 --> 01:19:49,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go, Richard Parker. Go.

621
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:52,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go on home, I'll leave you alone.

622
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:56,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll respect that, I promise.

623
01:20:00,210 --> 01:20:02,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go. Come on.

624
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:12,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes!

625
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:51,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I never thought a small piece of shade could bring me so much happiness.

626
01:20:52,340 --> 01:20:57,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That a pile of tools, a bucket, a knife, a pencil...

627
01:20:57,430 --> 01:20:59,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}might become my greatest treasures.

628
01:20:59,810 --> 01:21:03,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or that knowing Richard Parker was here might ever bring me peace.

629
01:21:04,810 --> 01:21:06,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In times like these...

630
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:11,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I remember that he has as little experience with the real world as I do.

631
01:21:11,490 --> 01:21:14,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We were both raised in a zoo by the same master.

632
01:21:14,990 --> 01:21:19,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now we've been orphaned, left to face our ultimate master together.

633
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:23,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Without Richard Parker, I would have died by now.

634
01:21:23,830 --> 01:21:26,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My fear of him keeps me alert.

635
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:29,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tending to his needs gives my life purpose.

636
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:36,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dolphins.

637
01:21:36,220 --> 01:21:38,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Richard Parker!

638
01:21:55,660 --> 01:21:57,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey!

639
01:22:49,460 --> 01:22:53,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Above all, don't lose hope.

640
01:23:25,580 --> 01:23:29,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}8、5、5、0、3、6、6
Eight, five, five, zero, three, six, six...

641
01:23:29,750 --> 01:23:32,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}0、8、0、1
zero, eight, zero, one...

642
01:23:32,460 --> 01:23:37,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}3、6、0、4、6、6、8、9
three, six, zero, four, six, six, eight...

643
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:47,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you looking at?

644
01:23:52,270 --> 01:23:54,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Talk to me.

645
01:23:57,650 --> 01:23:59,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell me what you see.

646
01:26:06,740 --> 01:26:10,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Words are all I have left to hang on to.

647
01:26:10,660 --> 01:26:14,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everything mixed up. Fragmented.

648
01:26:14,580 --> 01:26:19,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can't tell daydreams, night dreams, from reality anymo...

649
01:26:37,940 --> 01:26:39,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Storm, Richard Parker.

650
01:27:07,470 --> 01:27:08,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

651
01:27:14,180 --> 01:27:15,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

652
01:27:40,210 --> 01:27:42,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Praise be to God!

653
01:27:43,090 --> 01:27:45,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lord of all worlds!

654
01:27:45,210 --> 01:27:48,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The compassionate, the merciful!

655
01:27:55,180 --> 01:27:57,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come out.

656
01:27:58,190 --> 01:28:02,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Richard Parker! Come out, you have to see this!

657
01:28:03,860 --> 01:28:05,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's beautiful!

658
01:28:16,870 --> 01:28:21,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't hide yourself! He's come to us!

659
01:28:21,210 --> 01:28:22,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a miracle!

660
01:28:36,470 --> 01:28:40,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come out and see God, Richard Parker!

661
01:28:52,820 --> 01:28:56,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are you scaring him?

662
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:57,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, God!

663
01:28:57,410 --> 01:29:02,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've lost my family! I've lost everything!

664
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:06,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I surrender! What more do you want?

665
01:29:29,990 --> 01:29:32,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, Richard Parker.

666
01:32:40,050 --> 01:32:42,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're dying, Richard Parker.

667
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:49,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.

668
01:33:21,170 --> 01:33:25,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Amma, Appa, Ravi...

669
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:31,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm happy I'm going to see you soon.

670
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:42,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you feel the rain?

671
01:34:01,510 --> 01:34:06,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}God, thank you for giving me my life.

672
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:10,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm ready now.

673
01:34:41,670 --> 01:34:43,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Richard Parker?

674
01:36:22,020 --> 01:36:24,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me.

675
01:36:24,940 --> 01:36:26,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Move.

676
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:29,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Move. Excuse me.

677
01:38:42,120 --> 01:38:44,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey! Hey!

678
01:38:45,330 --> 01:38:46,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, come on!

679
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:55,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, get away. This is my bed.

680
01:41:03,470 --> 01:41:05,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was a human tooth?

681
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:09,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you see? The island was carnivorous.

682
01:41:09,310 --> 01:41:12,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Carnivorous? Like a Venus Flytrap?

683
01:41:12,310 --> 01:41:15,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, the whole island.

684
01:41:15,310 --> 01:41:19,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The plants, the water in those pools, the very ground itself.

685
01:41:20,490 --> 01:41:23,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}During the day, those pools held fresh water.

686
01:41:23,610 --> 01:41:25,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But at night, some chemical process

687
01:41:25,830 --> 01:41:28,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}turned the water in those pools into acid...

688
01:41:29,790 --> 01:41:32,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}acid that dissolved those fish...

689
01:41:32,160 --> 01:41:34,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that sent the meerkats scurrying into the trees,

690
01:41:34,750 --> 01:41:36,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and Richard Parker running to the boat.

691
01:41:37,130 --> 01:41:39,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But where did the tooth come from?

692
01:41:39,300 --> 01:41:42,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Years ago, some poor fellow, just like me...

693
01:41:42,260 --> 01:41:45,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}must have found himself stranded on that island...

694
01:41:45,180 --> 01:41:48,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and, like me, thought he might stay there forever.

695
01:41:48,680 --> 01:41:53,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But all that the island gave him by day, it took away again by night.

696
01:41:55,020 --> 01:42:00,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To think, how many hours spent with only meerkats for company.

697
01:42:00,360 --> 01:42:02,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How much loneliness taken on.

698
01:42:03,150 --> 01:42:05,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All I know is that eventually he died

699
01:42:05,450 --> 01:42:07,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and the island digested him...

700
01:42:07,620 --> 01:42:10,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}leaving behind only his teeth.

701
01:42:11,700 --> 01:42:15,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I saw how my life would end if I stayed on that island.

702
01:42:15,330 --> 01:42:17,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alone and forgotten.

703
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:22,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I had to get back to the world, or die trying.

704
01:42:26,390 --> 01:42:29,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I spent the next day preparing the boat.

705
01:42:29,350 --> 01:42:31,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I filled my stores with fresh water...

706
01:42:31,640 --> 01:42:34,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}ate seaweed until my stomach could take no more...

707
01:42:34,390 --> 01:42:40,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and brought as many meerkats as I could fit into the storage locker for Richard Parker.

708
01:42:41,070 --> 01:42:43,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I couldn't leave without him, of course.

709
01:42:43,320 --> 01:42:45,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It would mean killing him.

710
01:42:46,910 --> 01:42:49,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And so, I waited for his return.

711
01:42:51,990 --> 01:42:53,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I knew he wouldn't be late.

712
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:57,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Richard Parker!

713
01:43:09,930 --> 01:43:12,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No one has seen that floating island since.

714
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:15,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you won't read about those trees in any nature book.

715
01:43:16,060 --> 01:43:20,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And yet, if I hadn't found those shores, I would have died.

716
01:43:20,270 --> 01:43:22,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I hadn't discovered that tooth,

717
01:43:22,690 --> 01:43:25,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I would have been lost, alone forever.

718
01:43:25,950 --> 01:43:28,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Even when God seemed to have abandoned me...

719
01:43:28,610 --> 01:43:30,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was watching.

720
01:43:30,280 --> 01:43:33,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Even when He seemed indifferent to my suffering...

721
01:43:33,240 --> 01:43:34,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was watching.

722
01:43:34,870 --> 01:43:38,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And when I was beyond all hope of saving, He gave me rest...

723
01:43:38,870 --> 01:43:41,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then gave me a sign to continue my journey.

724
01:43:54,810 --> 01:43:57,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}By the time we reached the Mexican shore,

725
01:43:57,440 --> 01:44:00,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was afraid to let go of the boat.

726
01:44:00,770 --> 01:44:04,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My strength was gone. I was so weak.

727
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:08,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was afraid that in two feet of water, so close to deliverance...

728
01:44:08,280 --> 01:44:10,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I would drown.

729
01:44:19,580 --> 01:44:23,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I struggled to shore and fell upon the sand.

730
01:44:23,750 --> 01:44:25,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was warm and soft...

731
01:44:25,670 --> 01:44:28,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}like pressing my face against the cheek of God.

732
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:34,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And somewhere, two eyes were smiling at having me there.

733
01:44:38,350 --> 01:44:42,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was so spent, I could hardly move.

734
01:44:48,110 --> 01:44:51,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And so, Richard Parker went ahead of me.

735
01:44:52,660 --> 01:44:56,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He stretched his legs and walked along the shore.

736
01:45:00,460 --> 01:45:03,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At the edge of the jungle, he stopped.

737
01:45:03,880 --> 01:45:06,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was certain he was going to look back at me...

738
01:45:06,630 --> 01:45:09,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}flatten his ears to his head, growl.

739
01:45:09,880 --> 01:45:13,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That he would bring our relationship to an end in some way.

740
01:45:15,890 --> 01:45:19,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But he just stared ahead into the jungle.

741
01:45:22,650 --> 01:45:25,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then, Richard Parker, my fierce companion...

742
01:45:25,400 --> 01:45:28,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the terrible one who kept me alive...

743
01:45:30,860 --> 01:45:34,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}disappeared forever from my life.

744
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:44,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After a few hours, a member of my own species found me.

745
01:45:44,500 --> 01:45:47,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He left and returned with a group who carried me away.

746
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:52,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wept like a child.

747
01:45:52,220 --> 01:45:56,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not because I was overwhelmed at having survived, although I was.

748
01:45:57,430 --> 01:46:03,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was weeping because Richard Parker left me so unceremoniously.

749
01:46:05,060 --> 01:46:07,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It broke my heart.

750
01:46:13,070 --> 01:46:15,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, my father was right.

751
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:18,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Richard Parker never saw me as his friend.

752
01:46:19,450 --> 01:46:23,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After all we had been through, he didn't even look back.

753
01:46:24,540 --> 01:46:26,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I have to believe there was more in his eyes...

754
01:46:26,580 --> 01:46:29,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}than my own reflection staring back at me.

755
01:46:29,750 --> 01:46:32,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know it. I felt it.

756
01:46:32,920 --> 01:46:35,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Even if I can't prove it.

757
01:46:40,430 --> 01:46:41,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, I've left so much behind.

758
01:46:42,100 --> 01:46:45,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My family, the zoo, India, Anandi.

759
01:46:45,810 --> 01:46:49,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I suppose, in the end, the whole of life becomes an act of letting go.

760
01:46:50,650 --> 01:46:53,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But what always hurts the most...

761
01:46:53,650 --> 01:46:57,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is not taking a moment to say goodbye.

762
01:46:58,990 --> 01:47:03,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was never able to thank my father for all I learned from him.

763
01:47:03,330 --> 01:47:06,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To tell him, without his lessons...

764
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:09,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I would never have survived.

765
01:47:11,300 --> 01:47:14,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know Richard Parker is a tiger, but I wish I had said...

766
01:47:15,130 --> 01:47:17,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"It's over. We survived."

767
01:47:17,970 --> 01:47:21,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Thank you for saving my life. I love you, Richard Parker."

768
01:47:21,930 --> 01:47:24,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"You will always be with me."

769
01:47:26,190 --> 01:47:28,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"May God be with you."

770
01:47:35,690 --> 01:47:38,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know what to say.

771
01:47:44,370 --> 01:47:46,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's hard to believe, isn't it?

772
01:47:49,960 --> 01:47:52,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is a lot to take in.

773
01:47:52,540 --> 01:47:55,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To figure out what it all means.

774
01:47:55,460 --> 01:47:56,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If it happened, it happened.

775
01:47:56,720 --> 01:47:59,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why should it have to mean anything?

776
01:48:00,840 --> 01:48:03,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some of it is pretty incredible.

777
01:48:03,970 --> 01:48:06,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See, I was the only one who survived the shipwreck.

778
01:48:06,890 --> 01:48:10,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So the Japanese shipping company sent two men to talk to me...

779
01:48:10,230 --> 01:48:13,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in the Mexican hospital where I was recovering.

780
01:48:15,150 --> 01:48:17,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I still have a copy of their report.

781
01:48:19,240 --> 01:48:22,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They had insurance claims to settle...

782
01:48:22,490 --> 01:48:25,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and they wanted to find out why the ship sank.

783
01:48:26,410 --> 01:48:27,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They didn't believe me, either.

784
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:30,910


785
01:48:31,170 --> 01:48:34,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thousands of meerkats on a floating carnivorous island...

786
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:36,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and no one has ever seen it?

787
01:48:37,090 --> 01:48:39,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, just like I told you.

788
01:48:40,050 --> 01:48:41,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bananas don't float.

789
01:48:41,930 --> 01:48:43,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are you talking about bananas?

790
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:46,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You said the orangutan floated to you on a bundle of bananas.

791
01:48:46,430 --> 01:48:48,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But bananas don't float.

792
01:48:48,430 --> 01:48:49,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you sure about that?

793
01:48:49,940 --> 01:48:52,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course they do. Try it for yourself.

794
01:48:53,400 --> 01:48:57,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In any case, we are not here to talk about bananas or meerkats.

795
01:48:57,740 --> 01:49:01,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, I just told you along story and I'm very tired.

796
01:49:01,240 --> 01:49:06,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are here because a Japanese cargo ship sank in the Pacific.

797
01:49:06,290 --> 01:49:08,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something I never forget.

798
01:49:09,910 --> 01:49:12,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I lost my whole family.

799
01:49:17,130 --> 01:49:18,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get him some water.

800
01:49:21,260 --> 01:49:23,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't mean to push you.

801
01:49:24,550 --> 01:49:27,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you have our deepest sympathies.

802
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:29,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But we have come a long way...

803
01:49:29,770 --> 01:49:32,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and we are no closer to understanding why the ship sank.

804
01:49:33,100 --> 01:49:35,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because I don't know.

805
01:49:35,400 --> 01:49:36,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was asleep. Something woke me up.

806
01:49:37,110 --> 01:49:39,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It could have been an explosion, I can't be sure.

807
01:49:39,820 --> 01:49:41,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then the ship sank.

808
01:49:42,280 --> 01:49:43,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What else do you want from me?

809
01:49:44,110 --> 01:49:46,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A story that won't make us look like fools.

810
01:49:46,580 --> 01:49:49,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We need a simpler story for our report.

811
01:49:49,750 --> 01:49:51,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One our company can understand.

812
01:49:52,160 --> 01:49:54,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A story we can all believe.

813
01:49:57,500 --> 01:50:00,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, a story without things you've never seen before.

814
01:50:01,010 --> 01:50:02,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's right.

815
01:50:02,510 --> 01:50:06,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Without surprises. Without animals or islands.

816
01:50:06,850 --> 01:50:09,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. The truth.

817
01:50:18,070 --> 01:50:20,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, what did you do?

818
01:50:25,030 --> 01:50:27,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told them another story.

819
01:50:28,200 --> 01:50:29,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Four of us survived.

820
01:50:30,240 --> 01:50:32,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The cook and the sailor were already aboard.

821
01:50:33,080 --> 01:50:34,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The cook threw me a lifebuoy and pulled me aboard...

822
01:50:35,080 --> 01:50:38,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and Mother held on to some bananas and made it to the lifeboat.

823
01:50:40,210 --> 01:50:43,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The cook was a disgusting man.

824
01:50:43,380 --> 01:50:45,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He ate a rat.

825
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:48,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We had food enough for weeks, but he found the rat in the first few days...

826
01:50:49,050 --> 01:50:52,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and he killed it, dried it in the sun and ate it.

827
01:50:52,890 --> 01:50:55,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was such a brute, that man.

828
01:50:56,900 --> 01:50:59,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But he was resourceful.

829
01:50:59,940 --> 01:51:03,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was his idea to build the raft to catch fish.

830
01:51:03,740 --> 01:51:06,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We would have died in those first few days without him.

831
01:51:09,240 --> 01:51:13,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The sailor was the same man who brought rice and gravy, the Buddhist.

832
01:51:13,910 --> 01:51:17,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We didn't understand much of what he said, only that he was suffering.

833
01:51:17,750 --> 01:51:19,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He had broken his leg horribly in the fall.

834
01:51:20,090 --> 01:51:23,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We tried to set it as best we could, but the leg became infected...

835
01:51:23,590 --> 01:51:28,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and the cook said that we had to do something or he'd die.

836
01:51:28,590 --> 01:51:29,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The cook said he'd do it,

837
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:32,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but Mother and I had to hold the man down.

838
01:51:32,180 --> 01:51:34,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I believed him, we needed to do it.

839
01:51:35,430 --> 01:51:37,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So...

840
01:51:38,940 --> 01:51:42,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I kept saying, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry."

841
01:51:42,190 --> 01:51:46,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And he just kept looking at me. His eyes were so...

842
01:51:49,200 --> 01:51:52,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll never understand the point of that man's suffering.

843
01:51:53,830 --> 01:51:56,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can still hear him.

844
01:51:56,790 --> 01:52:00,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The happy Buddhist, he only ate rice and gravy.

845
01:52:05,670 --> 01:52:07,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We didn't save him, of course.

846
01:52:07,880 --> 01:52:09,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He died.

847
01:52:10,390 --> 01:52:12,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The morning after, the cook caught his first dorado...

848
01:52:12,640 --> 01:52:15,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I didn't understand what he had done at first, but Mother did...

849
01:52:15,850 --> 01:52:18,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I had never seen Mother so angry.

850
01:52:19,650 --> 01:52:21,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Stop whining and be happy," he said.

851
01:52:21,730 --> 01:52:24,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"We need more food or we'll die. That was the whole point."

852
01:52:24,730 --> 01:52:26,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"What was the whole point?" Mother asked.

853
01:52:26,820 --> 01:52:30,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"You let that poor boy die in order to get bait, you monster!"

854
01:52:32,410 --> 01:52:33,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The cook got furious.

855
01:52:33,660 --> 01:52:35,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He started towards her with his fist raised...

856
01:52:35,830 --> 01:52:38,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and Mother slapped him hard, right across the face.

857
01:52:39,040 --> 01:52:40,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was stunned.

858
01:52:41,080 --> 01:52:43,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought he was going to kill her right then.

859
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:46,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But he didn't.

860
01:52:48,670 --> 01:52:51,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The cook didn't stop at bait either, no.

861
01:52:52,590 --> 01:52:54,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The sailor...

862
01:52:55,930 --> 01:52:58,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He went the same way the rat went.

863
01:53:01,020 --> 01:53:03,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The cook was a resourceful man.

864
01:53:07,690 --> 01:53:09,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was a week later that he...

865
01:53:11,570 --> 01:53:13,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because of me.

866
01:53:13,910 --> 01:53:16,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because I couldn't hold on to a stupid turtle.

867
01:53:17,410 --> 01:53:19,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It slipped out of my hands and swam away.

868
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:22,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the cook came up and he punched me on the side of my head...

869
01:53:22,580 --> 01:53:24,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and my teeth clacked and I saw stars.

870
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:26,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought he was going to hit me again...

871
01:53:26,300 --> 01:53:28,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but Mother started pounding on him with her fists...

872
01:53:28,420 --> 01:53:30,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}screaming, "Monster, monster!"

873
01:53:30,380 --> 01:53:31,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She yelled at me to go to the raft.

874
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:36,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought she was coming with me, or I'd never have...

875
01:53:39,470 --> 01:53:42,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know why I didn't make her go first.

876
01:53:44,100 --> 01:53:46,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think about that every day.

877
01:53:52,490 --> 01:53:56,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I jumped over and turned back just as the knife came out.

878
01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:02,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There wasn't anything I could do.

879
01:54:04,420 --> 01:54:06,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I couldn't look away.

880
01:54:10,630 --> 01:54:13,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He threw her body overboard.

881
01:54:14,760 --> 01:54:18,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then the sharks came. And I saw what they...

882
01:54:23,310 --> 01:54:24,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I saw.

883
01:54:31,030 --> 01:54:33,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The next day, I killed him.

884
01:54:34,780 --> 01:54:37,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He didn't even fight back. He knew he had gone too far...

885
01:54:37,780 --> 01:54:39,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}even by his own standards.

886
01:54:41,830 --> 01:54:43,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He'd left the knife out on the bench,

887
01:54:43,460 --> 01:54:46,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I did to him what he did to the sailor.

888
01:54:49,380 --> 01:54:52,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was such an evil man, but worse still, he...

889
01:54:54,550 --> 01:54:57,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He brought the evil out in me.

890
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:01,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I have to live with that.

891
01:55:07,900 --> 01:55:10,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was alone in a lifeboat...

892
01:55:11,530 --> 01:55:14,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}drifting across the Pacific Ocean.

893
01:55:15,070 --> 01:55:16,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I survived.

894
01:55:22,040 --> 01:55:25,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After that, they had no more questions.

895
01:55:25,500 --> 01:55:29,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The investigators didn't seem to like the story, exactly.

896
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:34,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But they thanked me, they wished me well, and they left.

897
01:55:41,180 --> 01:55:43,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So the stories...

898
01:55:46,020 --> 01:55:48,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}both the zebra and the sailor...

899
01:55:48,850 --> 01:55:50,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}broke their leg.

900
01:55:51,190 --> 01:55:54,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the hyena killed the zebra and the orangutan.

901
01:55:54,860 --> 01:55:58,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So... the hyena is the cook.

902
01:55:59,200 --> 01:56:01,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The sailor is the zebra.

903
01:56:01,870 --> 01:56:04,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your mother is the orangutan.

904
01:56:04,910 --> 01:56:08,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you are...

905
01:56:08,870 --> 01:56:11,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the tiger.

906
01:56:15,300 --> 01:56:17,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I ask you something?

907
01:56:18,590 --> 01:56:20,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course.

908
01:56:20,590 --> 01:56:24,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've told you two stories about what happened out on the ocean.

909
01:56:24,600 --> 01:56:27,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Neither explains what caused the sinking of the ship...

910
01:56:28,060 --> 01:56:32,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and no one can prove which story is true and which is not.

911
01:56:32,400 --> 01:56:35,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In both stories, the ship sinks...

912
01:56:35,900 --> 01:56:38,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}my family dies and I suffer.

913
01:56:39,280 --> 01:56:40,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}True.

914
01:56:43,280 --> 01:56:45,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, which story do you prefer?

915
01:56:53,080 --> 01:56:55,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The one with the tiger.

916
01:56:56,250 --> 01:56:58,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's the better story.

917
01:57:01,840 --> 01:57:03,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

918
01:57:04,180 --> 01:57:06,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And so it goes with God.

919
01:57:18,320 --> 01:57:20,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mamaji was right.

920
01:57:21,150 --> 01:57:23,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's an amazing story.

921
01:57:24,870 --> 01:57:26,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will you really let me write it?

922
