00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:02,370
上溯至宇宙初始  周遭还只是一片漆黑
In the beginning, there was darkness.

10
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:03,880
不知何时  忽地一声巨响  
And then-- Bang!

11
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,640
时间空间以及物质皆由此发端
Giving birth to an endless, expanding existence

12
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,980
此后不断膨胀  延伸  永无止境
of time, space, and matter.

13
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,220
每一天  新的发现都在不断为我们解开 
Every day, new discoveries are unlocking

14
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,670
蕴藏于这里的那些神秘莫测  
the mysterious, the mind-blowing,

15
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,900
令人大开眼界  致命的秘密 
the deadly secrets of a place we call

16
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:18,900
我们称这个地方为"宇宙"
the universe.

17
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,000
审视地球难以置信的复杂多样性
Looking at the Earth's incredible complexity,

18
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,550
人类一直想要探寻其形成的原因
people have always wondered what made it all possible.

19
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:34,470
物理方程式是如何发挥作用的
What breathed fire into the equations of physics.

20
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:38,250
长期以来  宗教对此有精神阐释
Religion has long offered a spiritual explanation,

21
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,050
认为上帝创造了整个宇宙
that God created the universe.

22
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,890
目前的科学是否找到上帝存在的蛛丝马迹
But is science now starting to find elusive evidence of God

23
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,560
物理学能否证明我们根本就不需要造物者
or does physics tell us that no creator was necessary?

24
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:54,800
史蒂芬・霍金和我在《大设计》中写道
Stephen Hawking and I say in the book, The Grand Design,

25
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,850
宇宙的形成可能是一个从无到有的过程
that the universe could have come from nothing.

26
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:03,490
让我们开始在宇宙中进行对上帝的科学探索
Let's embark on a scientific search for God in the universe.

27
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,740
整个宇宙其实非常狂暴
The universe can be a very violent place.

28
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:24,390
星系之间经常碰撞
Where galaxies routinely collide.

29
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:30,030
耗尽的恒星不断发生爆炸
And exhausted stars... explode.

30
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,160
但也是在这里  
But it is also a place

31
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,990
诞生了超凡脱俗之物
that gave birth to something absolutely extraordinary,

32
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:41,770
至少地球上
at least here on Earth,

33
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,320
诞生了有意识情感的生命
conscious, sentient beings.

34
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,500
宇宙中为何会出现智慧生命的原因
It is, of course, a mystery to why the universe exists

35
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,110
令人难以捉摸
in such an intelligible manner,

36
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,110
但至少对我而言 
but it suggests me at least,

37
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:59,720
宇宙  其逐渐展开的宏大计划 
that there's a deep link between the universe,

38
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:03,080
以及像我们一样的生命之间有着很深的联系
the grand scheme that's unfolding, and beings like ourselves.

39
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,470
宇宙自知的
Somehow the universe has become self-aware.

40
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,990
保罗・戴维斯 
物理学家    《上帝的心意》作者

41
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:09,420
它造出了像人类这种有思维有理解力的生命
It's engineered the emergence of comprehending, thinking beings

42
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,000
有能力去探索宇宙的秘密
like ourselves, who can come to know the universe.

43
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,360
另许多人倍感惊奇的是
Some people marvel at the fact that

44
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,120
宇宙拥有几百亿年的历史
the universe has over billions of years,

45
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,960
诞出能够领会其复杂性的生命
giving birth to beings who can appreciate its complexity.

46
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:29,110
我们现在甚至开始思索  人类从何而来
We can even ponder where and how we fit in.

47
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,620
但是在人类历史初期  
But at the dawn of history,

48
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:38,750
人们认为自己知道此类深奥问题的答案
people thought they knew the answers to these profound questions.

49
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:43,510
古人将世界看做一个雪景球
The ancients viewed their world as a snow globe.

50
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:48,660
地球是平的  像个碟子  上面盖着天穹
It's essentially a flat earth, say a disc, covered by a dome.

罗伯特・嘉吉
爱荷华大学

52
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,990
英语里称作天穹 
And we call this, in English, a firmament,

53
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,350
恒星和行星即悬在那里
and in the firmament is where all the stars and planets were hung.

54
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,690
所有的古代文明相信 
Almost all ancient cultures believed

55
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:02,180
他们所在的宇宙都是在这样的一个弯顶下
their universe existed in a dome similar to this one.

56
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:06,210
他们从没质疑过谁是造物主的问题
And they never questioned who created it.

57
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:11,140
古人认定是上帝或者诸神
The ancients assumed that there was a God or gods

58
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:15,810
创造并维持了宇宙
responsible for the creation and the maintenance of the universe.

59
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,060
上帝创造了宇宙这一观点 
The idea that God created the universe

60
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,720
直到中世纪才遭到质疑
went largely unchallenged until the Middle Ages,

61
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,280
当时的科学家根据他们的观察
when scientists made a sacrilegious suggestion,

62
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,250
提出了亵渎神明的想法
based on their observations--

63
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,380
宇宙的中心不是地球  而是太阳
The Sun, not the Earth, was at the center of the universe.

64
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,750
人类的思维模式发生了改变   
There was a paradigm shift.

65
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:41,680
产生了解释我们周围自然现象的新方式 
There is now another way to explain the natural occurring phenomena around us,

66
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,490
而这就是科学
and this is science.

67
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:46,600
从中世纪开始  
Since the Middle Ages,

68
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,680
科学家们发展出了许多复杂的新理论  
scientists have developed sophisticated new theories

69
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,400
以描述宇宙的宏大以及地球所处的位置
about the enormity of the universe and our place in it,

70
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,090
在这些理论中往往都没有上帝的立足之地
theories that often have no room for God.

71
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,340
许多现象曾对人类来说非常神秘
Many phenomena have appeared mysterious or miraculous or magical,

72
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:05,140
亚历克・菲力彭科
加州大学伯克利分校

73
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,040
而通过科学研究
and then through the process of science,

74
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,820
人类慢慢开始理解这些现象
we've eventually understood them.

75
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:11,190
科学家们慢慢意识到  太阳仅仅是
Scientists gradually realized that the Sun really is just one star

76
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,900
巨大的星系中的一颗恒星
among a multitude of stars in a gigantic galaxy

77
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,710
而这个星系拥有数以亿计颗类似恒星
having hundreds of billions of such stars.

78
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,920
所有这一切都始于137亿年前的一次大爆炸
And all this was created in a Big Bang 13.7 billion years ago.

79
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,590
尽管科学理论  科学观察和实验
But while scientific theories, observations, and experiments

80
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,110
告诉我们人类在宇宙中的位置
tell us where we are in the cosmos,

81
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,530
它们仍未回答两个永恒的问题 
they don't answer the eternal questions:

82
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,490
即人类产生的原因  
Why we are here

83
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,850
若有造物主  它又是谁
and who, if anyone, created us.

84
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,140
一些物理学家继续探索这些问题的答案
So some physicists continue to search for those answers.

85
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,020
他们的发现十分惊人
What they're finding is extraordinary.

86
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:53,090
隐藏的非凡秩序支配着整个宇宙
A remarkable unseen order that may govern the universe.

87
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,670
人类为自然世界之美所倾倒
We're all struck by the beauty and majesty of the natural world, about us,

88
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:06,460
树木 天空 还有日落之美
the trees, the sky and the beauty of a sunset.

89
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,030
如此神奇  如此壮观
It is awesome and it's majesty.

90
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,790
我们如何才能了解这一切呢
How can we make sense of it all?

91
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:16,140
我们需要了解自然的潜台词
We need to look at the hidden subtext of nature,

92
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,300
也就是支持这个世界的数学关系
the mathematical relationships that underpin it,

93
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,220
形成某种影子世界
forming a sort of shadow world.

94
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,850
有人将其视作宇宙密码
Some people think of this as a cosmic code.

95
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,710
不管这些科学家是不是信仰上帝
Regardless of whether or not they believe in God,

96
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:33,440
他们大多承认宇宙密码的存在
most scientists agree the cosmic code appears to exist.

劳拉・丹莉
格里菲斯天文台

98
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,860
宇宙中的万物
Everything in the universe

99
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:43,460
都由自然的基本相互作用力支配着
is determined by the fundamental forces of nature.

100
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,820
这些作用力以数字为特征  称为
The strength of those forces are characterized by numbers, called

101
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,290
基本常数  它们如此敏感
"Fundamental constants" that are so sensitive

102
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,800
只要稍有改变
that if they changed by just a little bit,

103
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,390
我们所知的宇宙就不复存在了
the universe, as we know it, wouldn't be here.

104
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:02,290
譬如说  如果大爆炸之后宇宙的膨胀率
For example, if the rate of expansion of the universe right

105
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:06,630
有一万兆分之一的改变
after the Big Bang had changed by one part in a quintillion--

106
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:10,570
解释一下  1万兆就是1后面有18个零
a quintillion is one with 18 zeros after it--

107
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,230
宇宙将可能会持续膨胀
the universe would continue to expand...

108
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,910
或者坍塌回去
or collapse back on itself...

109
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,720
现在的一切都不复存在
And none of this would be possible.

110
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:25,830
为了说明一万兆分之一有多小
To illustrate just how small a number one part in a quintillion is,

111
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:28,960
你们可以想象一下这片沙滩上的沙粒
imagine all the grains of sand on this beach,

112
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:33,320
或者  想象地球上所有沙滩上所有的沙粒
in fact, imagine all the grains of sand in all the world's beaches.

113
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:36,560
沙粒总数大概在一万兆左右
That number's probably somewhere around a quintillion.

114
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,550
以此类推  假使沙粒总数代表的是
In this analogy, if all that sand represents the rate of

115
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,390
大爆炸之后宇宙的膨胀率
expansion of the universe right after the Big Bang,

116
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:49,040
若想破坏整个宇宙  须改变多少沙粒呢
how many grains of sand would I need to add or subtract to wreck the Universe?

117
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:55,710
仅仅一颗  一万兆分之一 
Just one grain, one in a quintillion--

118
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:59,880
宇宙出现的要求就是如此分毫不差
that's how precise things had to be for us to be here.

119
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:07,400
即使这次大爆炸范围分毫不差
But even though the Big Bang was perfectly calibrated,

120
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,020
如果物质平均延伸至整个宇宙
intelligent life would never have formed,

121
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:14,540
智慧生命也无法形成
if matter had spread evenly across the universe.

122
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:20,610
如果完全均匀  就不会产生任何结块 
Had it been perfectly smooth, then there wouldn't be any clumps,

123
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:23,710
就不可能相互吸引并形成恒星和星系
which would gravitate and form stars and galaxies.

124
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:26,580
因此在宇宙中
So, we needed slight irregularities

125
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,210
物质的分布要有些许不均
in the distribution of matter in the universe.

126
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,540
若物质分布更加均匀  
Had those irregularities been much smaller,

127
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,960
恒星和星系就不可能形成  
stars and galaxies wouldn't have formed.

128
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:36,950
若分布过于不均
Had they been much larger,

129
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,140
一切物质会塌缩成一个黑洞
everything would have collapsed to form black holes.

130
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:45,970
即使整个宇宙中的物质分布恰到好处
But even with the right distribution of matter throughout the universe,

131
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,720
没有恒星内部一系列复杂过程  
life would still never have formed

132
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:54,510
生命也不会形成 
without a complex series of processes inside stars

133
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,390
这个过程即是将氦和氢
that converted helium and hydrogen

134
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,970
转化成更重的元素  
into heavier elements, like carbon

135
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:03,210
譬如形成所有生物的基本元素  碳
that formed the bases of all living beings.

136
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,210
其中一些恒星爆炸
Some of those stars explode,

137
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,720
为新生恒星  行星以及最终的生命
providing raw material with which to form new stars,

138
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:12,500
提供了原材料
planets, and, ultimately, life.

139
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,660
如果物理定律有些许不同  
Had the laws of physics been a little bit different,

140
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:18,650
甚至是物理常数跟实际
or even if physical constants had been a little bit different

141
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,810
有些许差别 
from what they really are,

142
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:24,140
核聚变的过程以及恒星爆炸  
this process of nuclear fusion and the explosion of stars

143
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,010
都不会发生
might not have been possible,

144
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,560
我们也就不可能站在这讨论这个问题
and we wouldn't be here discussing it.

145
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,140
我从没见过任何科学家会否认 
I don't know a single scientist who would disagree with the statement

146
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,210
这个世界无比精妙这个说法
that the world is exceedingly ingenious...

147
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,770
不仅是数学意义上的  不仅美丽优雅  
Not just mathematical, not just beautiful, not just elegant,

148
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:43,990
这是对无与伦比之事物的完美诠释
but the manifestation of something truly extraordinary.

149
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:49,570
宇宙这种非凡的至臻之极
How could this extraordinary fine-tuning of the universe

150
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,230
怎能不是神圣造物主存在的确切证据呢
be anything less than unmistakable evidence of a divine creator.

151
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:01,360
人们说这种至臻之极绝对证明了
It's often said that the delicate fine-tuning

152
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:05,710
存在某种力量精心调配出这一切
must be evidence that some agency tuned it that way.

153
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:11,880
但大多数物理学家都持不同看法
Most physicists' take on this is actually not to go in that direction.

154
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:15,010
如果你再物理学中发现经过精密调整的事物
When you see something that's finely tuned in physics,

155
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:18,090
克利福德・强森
南加州大学

156
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,710
这往往意味着
it usually means there's a mechanism

157
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:19,000
有尚未知晓的机制 
that you don't yet understand

158
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:22,030
在当中发挥作用
that is playing a role there.

159
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,970
即使看起来像是有位神圣造物主创造了宇宙
So, while it appears a divine creator planned the universe,

160
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:34,920
许多物理学家认为精密调制不能证明其存在
many physicists say apparent fine-tuning doesn't prove anything of the sort.

161
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,150
肯定有其它事物在起作用
Something else must be at work.

162
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,610
但是除了上帝  还有什么事物
But what other than God could possibly explain

163
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,430
能够创造出这一系列非凡的事件 
the remarkable series of events

164
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,910
最终导致宇宙中生命的诞生
that led to the creation of life in our universe?

165
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:53,690
有种非常流行的理论  听起来似乎
One very popular contender is the idea that seems

166
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:56,940
跟有神论一样难以置信
at least as incredible as the idea of God.

167
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,570
称之为多宇宙论
It's the multiple-universe theory.

168
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,620
即在广袤的超空间中
A very large number of universes

169
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,300
存在数量极多的宇宙 
perhaps even an infinite number,

170
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:10,420
这个数量甚至可能是无限的
could, in principle exist in a vast hyperspace.

171
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,760
用一杯啤酒作比喻 
We can understand the idea of hyperspace

172
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,330
我们便能理解超空间的概念
by comparing it to a mug of beer.

173
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,490
这个啤酒杯代表的是超空间
The beer mug would be the hyperspace

174
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:22,310
当中的气泡就是单个的宇宙
and the bubbles would be these individual universes.

175
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:26,520
啤酒杯中的气泡外表几乎相同
The bubbles in a beer mug are all physically about the same.

176
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,940
设想一下  它们的属性成分可能不一样
But suppose they span a range of properties.

177
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,410
有一些含有碳  氧
Some of them might have carbon, oxygen

178
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:37,170
恒星和重力  其它的可能没有
and stars and gravity, and others don't.

179
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:42,280
而我们则是其中一个宇宙  富饶  复杂 
We would be in one of the ones that leads to a rich, complex universe

180
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:45,210
最终诞生出生命
combinating with life as we know it.

181
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,250
如果真有无限的宇宙  而这种精密调配
If there are an infinite number of other universes

182
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,520
出现在我们所在的宇宙  
the fine tuning that seems to be present in ours

183
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:57,620
与其说上帝的杰作  不如说是统计学定律
isn't an example of God's plan but rather the law of statistics.

184
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,750
大部分宇宙不会自然地向这方面发展
Most of these universes wouldn't naturally develop

185
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,810
并最终孕育出智慧生命
in ways that fostered intelligent life...

186
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:07,250
只有一小部分会
But a few, would.

187
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,210
因此对于我们所处宇宙的特殊性的解释是
So then the explanation for the specialness of the universe

188
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:15,220
我们是这个巨型宇宙抽奖中的赢家
is that we are winners in a gigantic cosmic lottery.

189
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,320
因为在不利于生命存在的宇宙中 
It stands to reason that we couldn't be living and discussing this

190
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,890
我们无法生存并讨论这个问题
in a universe that was hostile to life,

191
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,700
只有生态友善型宇宙中才会产生智能生命
only the bio-friendly ones get populated with thinking beings.

192
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:31,720
多重宇宙论其实是自然和简单的结论
Having a multitude of universes is actually a simple and natural consequence

193
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,800
因为它和我们所处宇宙
of some of the most favorite models

194
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:37,500
诞生和早期演变的最佳模型不谋而合
for the birth and early evolution of our universe.

195
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,660
就像是恒星和行星
It's kind of like stars and planets.

196
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:42,860
只要有能力制造一个
As long as you have the capacity to make one,

197
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,880
就很容易产生更多
it's easy to make lots of them.

198
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:51,810
但是一些神学家表示多重宇宙论
But some theologians say the idea of an infinite number of universes

199
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,080
没有看不见的造物主论
isn't any more likely than an unseen creator

200
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,810
更有可能保证生命的诞生
ensuring our universe is habitable for life.

201
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,970
相信多重宇宙的存在
A multiverse requires as much belief

202
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:06,670
罗伯特・斯皮策神父  
玛吉斯理性与信仰中心

203
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:05,780
就如相信上帝一般
as belief in a transcendent God.

204
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:08,730
目前没有证据可以证明其存在
There is simply no evidence for it right now,

205
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,660
而且以后也可能很难找到证据
and it may be very difficult to prove it in the future.

206
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,140
物理学家保罗・戴维斯说  
Physicist Paul Davies said,

207
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:17,620
"若只为解释我们的宇宙是如何产生  
"To postulate trillions upon trillions upon trillions of universes,

208
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,230
就贸然假设存在亿万个宇宙 
just to explain one like ours

209
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:25,180
无非是给宇宙极端加上负担"
is bringing excess baggage to cosmic extremes."

210
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:32,630
上帝创世与宇宙学说之间的辩论
This debate about the question of God and the universe

211
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:35,790
可能即将进入最激烈的时期
may soon enter an explosive phase.

212
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:41,810
令人震惊的新理论指出
Startling new theories suggest something could exist

213
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,590
可能有物体存在于另一维度 
in an unexplored dimension

214
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:48,570
并且离我们只有几毫米的距离
just millimeters away from each person on Earth.

215
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:59,440
在宇宙中探寻上帝的热潮愈演愈烈
While the search for God in the universe heats up,

216
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:02,310
一些科学家正致力于新理论
some scientists are working to develop a theory

217
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:05,660
它被喻为  "物理界的圣杯"
that has been called "The Holy Grail of Physics".

218
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:10,260
它可以解释宇宙中的一切
A theory that could explain everything in the universe

219
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,270
包括它的诞生
including how it started.

220
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,000
这就是弦理论
It's called String Theory.

221
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,300
弦理论是目前流行的极有野心的新理论 
String Theory is the latest ambitious popular attempt

222
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:25,050
它试图将物理界各种分支集为一体
to pull all of the disparate strands of physics together

223
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,500
保罗・戴维斯 
物理学家    《上帝的心意》作者

224
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,500
形成统一的理论
into one grand unified theory.

225
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:33,660
既然它声称能解释物理界中几乎所有问题
Since it promises to answer nearly every question in physics,

226
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,790
那么弦理论是否能告诉我们
will string theory be able to tell us

227
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:39,050
到底是超然的上帝
whether it was a transcendent creator

228
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:41,580
还是物理学定律
or the laws of physics alone

229
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,360
创造了宇宙呢
that gave birth to the universe?

230
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,890
这让我们达到更深的一个层次
This is getting us one level deeper.

231
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:52,460
每当我们发现新联系时  我们就更深一步
Every time we find new links between things, we go down a level.

232
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,650
这令我们距全貌更近一些
It's getting us closer to the total package

233
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:57,910
最终当我们获得宇宙的所有信息时
and when we get that complete description of the universe

234
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,910
就无法再深入了
well, we can't do much better than that.

235
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:04,920
无论弦理论是否指向上帝
Whether or not String Theory leads us to God,

236
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:08,110
它已经指引我们去考虑
it already offers tantalizing suggestions

237
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:13,170
人类尚未发现的维度
about unexplored dimensions that humans have never detected.

238
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:17,210
弦理论的基本观点是 
The basic idea of String Theory

239
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:20,820
宇宙中存在有基础能量单元
is that there are these little fundamental packages of energy.

240
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,250
被称之为闭合弦
You could call them little strings,

241
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:27,930
它们抖动的方式不同  而这种不同
and they vibrate in different ways, and the different modes of vibration

242
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:31,120
亚历克・菲力彭科
加州大学伯克利分校

243
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:31,120
就产生了宇宙中
correspond to the different kinds of fundamental particles

244
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:33,170
不同的基本粒子
we observe in the universe.

245
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,670
根据理论
According to the theory,

246
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:39,270
这些无穷小的闭合弦
these infinitesimally small strings

247
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:43,140
是所有能量和物质的基本单位
are the fundamental building blocks of all energy and matter,

248
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,450
但是该理论的数学基础
but the mathematics behind the theory

249
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:49,320
却指向了一个惊人的结论
suggests one astounding conclusion.

250
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:54,190
闭合弦不仅需要在三维世界振动
The strings have to vibrate not just in the three dimensions we see,

251
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:57,280
而且需要在更高维度如此  那么问题便是
but in a larger number. And so this raises a question...

252
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,540
这些额外维度在哪
where are all these extra dimensions?

253
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:06,380
一些物理学家认为  额外维度可能极小
Some physicists believe those extra dimensions may be so small,

254
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,770
人类从未能探测到
we've never been able to detect them.

255
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,230
但是另外一些认为
But others say that some of them

256
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:16,110
它们可能存在于我们的宇宙之外
may lie outside our universe...

257
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,790
在所谓的"体宇宙"中
in a so-called "Bulk universe."

258
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,600
很有可能  我们的宇宙
It's quite possible that our universe,

259
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,670
一个四维的宇宙  
the four easily observed dimensions--

260
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,630
只是存在于高维度体宇宙 中的一层"膜宇宙"
is like a membrane within a higher-dimensional bulk.

261
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,060
根据理论  高维度体宇宙
In theory, the higher dimensional bulk

262
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,780
可以离我们近在咫尺
could exist just millimeters away from us

263
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,990
因为它在另一维度
because it is in a different dimension.

264
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:46,860
但是为何它近在咫尺人类却从未察觉
But how could things exist so close to us without our knowing?

265
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,130
而这对于上帝
And what might that imply about

266
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:53,370
是否存在  又有何影响
the existence, or the nonexistence, of God?

267
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:58,770
天文学家劳拉・丹莉将对此做出讲解
Astronomer Laura Danly demonstrates this concept

268
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:04,600
她身处三维世界  有高度  宽度及深度
from her three-dimensional world of height, width, and depth

269
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,980
她将与屏幕中的
by trying to communicate with physicist

270
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:10,760
物理学家亚历克・菲力彭科交流   
Alex Filippenko, who's on a television screen

271
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,160
他身处二维世界  只有高度和宽度
with just two dimensions-- height and width.

272
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:20,860
亚历克  亚历克
Alex? Alex?

273
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,510
亚历克看不到劳拉  因为他处于二维空间中
Alex can't see Laura because he's trapped in two dimensions.

274
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:29,820
他缺少深度来与劳拉的世界沟通
He has no dimension of depth, that would link him to Laura's world.

275
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,600
他无法看见自己的身前或背后
He can't see in front of him and he can't see behind him,

276
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:36,030
劳拉・丹莉  
格里菲斯天文台

277
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:39,070
因为在他的二维世界中  不存在前后
because in his two-dimensional universe, there is no in front or behind.

278
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:41,730
我却可以看到自己身后
I, on the other hand, can see behind me

279
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:44,150
以及屏幕中的亚历克
and see Alex on that screen.

280
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:48,190
她也能听见亚历克说话
And she can also hear what Alex says.

281
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,420
如果物理定律局限于
If the laws of physics are constrained to work

282
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,130
某几个维度中
in a certain number of dimensions,

283
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:58,330
那么我们就无法看到  摸到或是感受到 
then we can't physically see or touch or experience

284
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:02,210
另一个与这几维度垂直的维度
a dimension that's perpendicular to those dimensions.

285
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,850
假设你所处的宇宙 
So, for example, suppose your universe, your hypothetical universe,

286
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,980
是这块电视屏幕的表面
was just the surface of this television screen.

287
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:11,740
你可以上下左右运动
You can go up, down, left and right,

288
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:16,340
或者是这些方向的组合  却无法向里或向外
or any combination of those motions, but you can't go in or out.

289
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:20,830
这个维度可以用数学理论进行描述
That dimension would be a mathematical describable

290
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:23,730
但实际上却无法接触
but physically inaccessible dimension.

291
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,300
亚历克
Alex?

292
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,760
就如亚历克与劳拉身处一室
Just as Alex can be in the same room as Laura

293
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,800
却无法感知她一样  
without being able to see or hear her,

294
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,480
我们身边就可能隐藏着永远无法探知的维度
there could be hidden dimensions right beside us that we can never detect.

295
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,120
如果上帝或其他神物存在于高维度 
If God or other sanction creatures exist in a higher number of dimensions

296
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,090
他们便可看见我们
they might be able to see us,

297
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:49,710
并且接近我们  却不被知晓
and get very close to us without our knowing it.

298
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,920
你可以想象或推测  智能生物
You can imagine and speculate that there are intelligent forms

299
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,450
生存于这些高维度空间中
of life that live in these higher-dimensional scenarios

300
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:02,300
对我们的维度产生作用
that we see the effects of somehow in our dimensions,

301
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:08,000
而我们却没有意识到这是生物对世界的影响
and we don't realize that they're actual living agents affecting our lives.

克利福德・强森
南加州大学

303
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,060
我想现在的科学无法推翻它
I think right now science can certainly not disprove that.

304
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,180
它也留给了我们很多推测的空间
I think it's-- it's very much in the realm of speculation.

305
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,780
弦理论表示我们的宇宙可能延至其它维度中
String theory predicts that our universe extends into other dimensions,

306
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:23,300
却并未说明其它维度中是否有特定生物
but doesn't predict that anything in particular lives in those other dimensions.

307
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:27,990
没有一个大胡子家伙在创造宇宙
There's no bearded fellow there creating the universe

308
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:31,070
或是操控一切
or pulling the strings.

伦纳德・曼罗迪诺
 《大设计》合著者

310
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,630
神学家表明  
Theologians argue

311
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,190
我们无法按照弦理论所说 
we'll never find God in the 11-dimensional reality

312
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:40,910
在十一度空间中找到上帝
predicted by String Theory,

313
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,770
因为上帝超越了体宇宙
because he transcends the bulk universe.

314
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:51,450
藏于弦理论提出的十一度空间 
Hidden within the 11 dimensions of String Theory

315
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:54,050
已经十分的不凡  
is a remarkable amount of fine-tuning...

316
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:57,800
但是藏于在十一度空间中的
But hidden within the 11 dimensions of string theory

罗伯特・斯皮策神父  
玛吉斯理性与信仰中心

318
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:01,100
并不能完全否认
is not an unconditioned,

319
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,340
完全智能
completely intelligible,

320
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:07,440
无限制连续创造着的存在
unrestricted, continuously creating reality.

321
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:14,190
然而  一些科学家相信
However some scientists believe that even

322
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:16,980
即使上帝不存在于体宇宙中
if God doesn't exist in the bulk universe

323
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,340
大爆炸的起因可能源于体宇宙
the reason for the Big Bang, might.

324
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:26,380
有假设表示  大爆炸源于
There's one hypothesis that the Big Bang resulted

325
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:29,140
两层平行膜
when two of these parallel membranes

326
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:32,950
在高维度超空间内相互碰撞
crashed together in a higher-dimensional hyperspace.

327
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:35,900
我个人并不同意这一假设
I personally don't subscribe to that hypothesis,

328
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,610
但这是个有趣的想法
but it is an interesting idea.

329
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:43,130
科学如何能证明或推翻
But how can science proof or disproof what happens

330
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:45,180
在假设的维度中会发生什么
in these proposed extra dimensions

331
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:49,230
它又如何能支持或反对造物者的存在
and whether they support or undermine the existence of a creator

332
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,570
我们毕竟被困在三维空间之中
when we're destined to remain in our 3 dimensional world?

333
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:01,160
一种途径便是  我们可以通过粒子碰撞
One possibility is that we can find the effects of those other dimensions

334
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:04,540
试图让它们进入其他维度
by interacting with particles that may be able

335
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,480
以发现其他维度所产生的影响
to move into those other dimensions.

336
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,840
为了找到能够进入更高维度的物质
To find matter that moves into higher dimensions

337
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:13,780
科学家们建造了庞大的加速器
scientists have built enormous accelerators

338
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:18,780
用于超高速对撞亚原子
that smash subatomic particles together at tremendous speeds.

339
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,550
但这些粒子加速器很快就可一撞惊人
But these particle accelerators may soon do something else as astounding,

340
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:28,310
这在几年前是完全无法想象的
something that seemed impossible only a few years ago.

341
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:31,920
它们可能让科学家回溯到
They may allow scientists to go back in time

342
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:35,750
几乎是宇宙诞生的那一瞬
to nearly the moment our universe was created...

343
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:39,110
也许像一些人推测的那样
and perhaps as some have suggested,

344
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,100
撇一眼造物者的身影
catch a glimpse of our creator.

345
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:49,860
为确定是上帝
To help determine whether God

346
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:54,030
或是物理规律创造了宇宙
or the law of physics alone created the universe,

347
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,550
科学家们花了数十亿美元
scientists are using multibillion-dollar

348
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:01,350
建造粒子加速器  带他们重返
particle accelerators to take them in a journey back in time

349
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:03,850
宇宙诞生的那一瞬
to nearly the moment of creation.

350
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:08,450
为达成这一目标
To achieve this remarkable feat

351
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:11,340
物理学家在巨型椭形轨道中
physicists send subatomic particles screaming

352
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,610
将亚原子向相反方向发射
in opposite directions around enormous oval tracks.

353
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,480
当这些微物质达到接近光速时
When these tiny pieces of matter reach nearly the speed of light

354
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,370
科学家们将他们引向对方
scientists steer them into each other.

355
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,920
这样粗暴地对撞
But how can these violent explosions,

356
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,730
是如何使科学家回到过去 
possibly allow scientists to look back

357
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:35,790
解释上帝是否存在的
far into the past to shed light on the question of God?

358
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:41,010
粒子加速器让我们超越理论的限制
What particle accelerators do is take us beyond the realm of theory

359
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:44,140
直击大爆炸之后一瞬 
and give us some direct access to the physics that prevailed

360
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,360
所发生的事
at the first split second after the Big Bang.

保罗・戴维斯 
物理学家    《上帝的心意》作者

362
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,790
这样的基本粒子高能对撞  
These high-energy collisions of elementary particles

363
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:56,810
可以在瞬间产生足够的能量
that go on in these experiments create enough energy to create, for a moment,

克利福德・强森
南加州大学

365
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:59,200
模拟宇宙诞生初期的状况
the conditions of the very early universe,

366
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,170
我们可以利用物理原理
and then we can actually study that moment of creation,

367
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:03,240
来研究这一时期
using the laws of physics.

368
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:09,010
粒子对撞产生的能量
The enormous energy that comes out of these particle collisions

369
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:12,370
是大爆炸之后
is a microscopic version of the super-heated conditions

370
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:15,620
高温状态的一个缩影
that existed just after the Big Bang.

371
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:22,020
粒子加速器的一个恰当的类比
A useful analogy for what goes in a particle accelerator

372
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,320
就是让遥控赛车
is to actually use remote-controlled cars

373
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,940
在真实赛道上奔驰
going around an actual racetrack.

374
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:35,580
我现在和专家丹纳斯在赛道边上
I'm actually here at the racetrack with an expert Dana

375
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,470
他正教我如何使用遥控器
who's been showing me how to use these remote controls

376
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:41,350
控制车围绕赛道跑
to drive these cars around the track.

377
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,340
Dana  这些车速度多少
Dana, how fast are these cars going?

378
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:46,250
大约每小时40公里
They're going around 25 miles per hour.

379
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:49,520
如果是实体车  可以达到每小时200公里
And if it was a real-sized car, it would be going to 125 mph.

380
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:52,150
这是是很恰当的演示
That's actually great for a demonstration,

381
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:54,280
因为这些小物体
because having these small objects,

382
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,820
这些围绕轨道高速行驶的小车
the cars, going around the track at high speed

383
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,370
与粒子加速器里的情况相同
is exactly what goes on in the particle accelerator,

384
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,020
加速器中微小的基本粒子被驱动着 
where you have the tiny fundamental particles begin driven around the track

385
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,810
以近光速的高速围绕轨道运行
at incredibly high speeds, almost the speed of light.

386
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:10,800
利用圆形轨道用强力磁场做引导
The guided rounded track, using powerful magnets.

387
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,690
我们用这些小车来代表
We actually want the cars to represent these super-fast particles

388
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:17,050
粒子加速器中的超高速粒子
that are going around in the particle accelerator.

389
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:19,560
现在我们已经让赛车达到预期速度了
So now that we've got the cars up to speed,

390
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,410
我想做一件有趣的事
I'm thinking a fun thing to do would be to

391
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:23,960
即引导它们相撞  
actually guide them into each other and collide them.

392
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,120
可以这样做吗
Could we do that?

393
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,770
可以  但会是一次严重车祸
We could, but we're gonna get a big crash.

394
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:30,570
-会发生什么呢  -残骸乱飞
- What would happen? - Oh, parts are gonna go everywhere.

395
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,050
开始吧
Well, let's do it.

396
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,070
好极了
Oh, that's great!

397
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,420
残骸到处散落  我们去看看
Pieces everywhere, let's go and have a look.

398
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,260
好极了
This is great.

399
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,060
大片都在这里
Wow, we have all of these great pieces.

400
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,610
这里有很多碎片
A lot of pieces here.

401
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:01,520
这次碰撞产生的能量
The energy created in this collision

402
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,220
立刻将小车瓦解成许多碎片
immediately shatters the cars into dozens of pieces.

403
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,690
当这种爆炸在粒子加速器中
When this explosion is amplified exponentially,

404
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,560
以指数倍数放大
in a particle accelerator,

405
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,520
产生了如此巨大的能量  
it creates so much energy that,

406
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,980
以至于有一刹那
for a split second,

407
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,480
碰撞点周围的情况 
the conditions around the crash site

408
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:19,500
近似于宇宙最初形成时的状况
begin to resemble those near the moment our universe was created,

409
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:25,130
科学家或能看到上帝之手在创造这一切
and scientists may be able to see the hand of God starting it all.

410
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,880
宇宙早期的模样
You actually get a glimpse of

411
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:31,060
由此可略见一斑
what the universe was like very early on.

412
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:33,600
我们能看到宇宙的初生
So we get a glimpse of creation.

413
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:38,960
通过物理  我们能看到数十亿年前
We can actually see how things got the way they are now

414
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:42,770
宇宙的万物是如何发展至今日的
through physics that was going on billions of years ago.

415
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:46,960
正如通过用实验制造一些碎片
So it's as though as going back to the factory of creation

416
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,410
还原工厂生产的情形
by creating a little piece of it in the experiment

417
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:52,910
这使得我们能见到创世的瞬间
and allowing us to look at the creation moment

418
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:56,440
看看物理学定律能否展示当时的真实情况
and see that the laws of physics can tell us what really happened--

419
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,130
同样
In the same way here,

420
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,670
我们可以通过撞车的结果
if we look at the output of the collision,

421
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:03,540
用物理学原理推导出
and we can use the laws of physics to figure out

422
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,170
小车是怎样相撞的
how the cars collided

423
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,170
以及小车是由什么组成的
and what the cars were made of.

424
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:16,520
粒子加速器尚未能解答有神与否
Particle accelerators have not yet answered the God question,

425
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:20,150
因为最新技术还无法产生足够能量
because the latest technology can't generate enough energy

426
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:24,050
无法回溯到创世瞬间
to go all the way back to the exact moment of creation.

427
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,920
迄今为止  科学家们已能再现
So far, scientists have reached

428
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,870
创世大爆炸后的一瞬间
to a fraction of a second after the Big Bang.

429
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:34,510
尚未发现任何物理学无法解释之事
Without finding anything that can't be explained by physics.

430
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,210
当然  人们想回最初那一刻
Of course, people want to go back to the very first moment itself.

431
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:42,550
在他们想象中  得以见证
That's where they might imagine that one would see, so to speak,

432
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:44,950
上帝之手或是创始者之标
the hand of God or the maker's mark.

433
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:46,760
这仍未实现
We haven't got there yet.

434
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:50,400
根据我们所有的实验和观察
With all the experiments and observations that we've made,

435
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,710
尚未发现任何违背物理规律的情况
we've never found any single exception to physical law,

436
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:56,960
伦纳德・曼罗迪诺
 《大设计》合著者

437
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:55,870
我们可以认为
so we believe that there's a good case to be made

438
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:57,310
奇迹没有发生
that miracles don't happen,

439
00:25:57,310 --> 00:26:00,500
一切皆可用自然法则来解释
and everything can be explained by the laws of nature.

440
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,880
目前为止
Just because up to this point,

441
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:08,840
尚未发现物理学原理无法解释的事情
one has not discovered anything that couldn't be explained by a physical law

442
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:11,240
罗伯特・斯皮策神父  
玛吉斯理性与信仰中心

443
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,020
但这并不意味着 在将来
doesn't mean that in the future

444
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:14,200
不会有大量
there couldn't be literally thousands of things

445
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:19,160
用物理学无法解释的最新发现
newly discovered that aren't explained by any physical law.

446
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,760
为什么呢
Why is that?

447
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:26,090
因为科学本身必须接受新的发现
Because science itself must always be open to new discoveries.

448
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:29,960
然而  如果科学家最终能够
However, if scientist are eventually able

449
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,990
用自然规律解释一切
to use the laws of nature to explain everything,

450
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,820
是否有一天能用科学角度来理解
will be someday be able to understand, in scientific terms,

451
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:44,450
类似灵魂和意识  天堂和地狱的概念呢
concepts like the soul, consciousness, heaven and hell?

452
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:47,370
要求科学有一天能找到
It's probably asking too much in science to find

453
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:49,840
代表天堂或其他来自古老神话
that one day there'll be solutions of equations

454
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:53,290
这些伟大事物的方程解
that represent heaven or hell or some other great thing

455
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,400
似乎有些过分了
from mythological legends of old.

456
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:59,280
这些也许比科学精妙得多
It's probably going to be a lot more subtle than that.

457
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:08,160
对于创世界 科学家们希望
Physicists hope to eventually have a complete scientific explanation

458
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,600
最终做出完整的科学解释 
for how the universe was created,

459
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,750
但他们说这也许超出了他们的理解
but they say it may be beyond their grasp

460
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:18,130
无法确定上帝是否创立了这些科学法则
to determine whether or not God created these scientific laws.

461
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,340
除非有个创造者于实行计划时
Unless we had a creator who left a message

462
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:25,280
在宇宙密码中留下了一条信息
inside the universe's cosmic code when he programmed it.

463
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:30,080
宇宙程序建筑师的线索
Are there clues to the architect of that cosmic program,

464
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:32,870
这些深藏在宇宙中的数据
buried deep within it, with all those ones and zeros,

465
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:34,450
会像造物主的标记一样
like the maker's mark

466
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:37,480
于宇宙初始时烙印在建筑师的身上吗
stamped on the architect of the universe at the outset?

467
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:40,330
这个问题充满诱惑力
Well, the problem is tantalizing those ideas,

468
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:42,550
因为就算永远研究这些数据
one might follow those ones and zeroes

469
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:45,230
也许还是找不到这个标记
forever and ever and still not find this mark.

470
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,780
我认为那是做无用功  注定要失败
I think that's a lost cause, a hopeless exercise,

471
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,210
但是在更深的层次  
but in some deeper sense,

472
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:51,420
若宇宙遵循数学原理
the fact that the universe is mathematical--

473
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:55,260
当我们探索数学领域时
and when we explore Mathematical realm,

474
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,800
在某种意义上我们得以一窥上帝的意志
we are, in a certain sense glimpsing the mind of God.

475
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,150
我们真正在做的  是在一个隐性的层次
What we're really doing is exploring, at a hidden level,

476
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,150
探索自然规律
the order in nature.

477
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:09,260
但是最近一位世界上最受尊重的科学家
But one of the most respected scientists in the world

478
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:12,570
近期震惊了世界
recently rocked the planet

479
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:16,200
他声称已探寻出自然界的隐性规律
when he said he's explored the hidden order of nature

480
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:19,430
并用数学的证据说明
and found mathematical proof

481
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,390
上帝不需存在
that God doesn't need to exist.

482
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:31,460
宇宙与上帝的争论愈演愈烈
As the debate over God and the universe rages

483
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:35,560
著名物理学家霍金于其著作《大设计》写道
fame physicist Stephen Hawking said in his book the Grand Design

484
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,580
量子理论最新的推算
that the latest calculations in quantum theory

485
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:42,670
表明宇宙从不需要创世者
suggest a universal creator need never have existed.

486
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:47,140
霍金及其合著人伦纳德・曼罗迪诺
Hawking and co-author Leonard Mlodinow

487
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,270
断言物理规则
assert that the laws of physics

488
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:55,080
令整个宇宙自发形成
allow entire universes to form spontaneously.

489
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:59,280
史蒂芬・霍金和我在《大设计》中说到
Stephen Hawking and I say in The grand design

490
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,990
宇宙  银河系  太阳系
that the universe, the galaxy, the Solar System,

491
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,790
地球  岩石
the Earth, this rock,

492
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,370
以及所有一切事物都可无中生有
that everything could have come from nothing.

493
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:06,110
伦纳德・曼罗迪诺
 《大设计》合著者

494
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:09,510
它们可以在量子论的空间中自发产生
They could have been created spontaneously from a quantum vacuum.

495
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:13,400
所以我们真的不需要上帝来创造世界
And so we don't really need God as a creator of the universe.

496
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:15,310
只需遵循物理定律就可形成
It follows from the laws of physics.

497
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:20,900
宇宙可以自发地源自于无
The universe could have formed spontaneously out of nothing,

498
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,980
因为根据量子论物理学
because according to quantum physics,

499
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:24,790
亚历克・菲力彭科
加州大学伯克利分校

500
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,840
粒子可以凭空出现一小段时间
particles can form for a short time out of nothing,

501
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,510
然后再度消失
and then they disappear again.

502
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:30,660
我们在实验室观察到这种现象并测量过
We see this happening in labs. We've measured it.

503
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:35,310
也许有很多量子波动已经消逝
Well, maybe there are lots of quantum fluctuations which go away,

504
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:41,580
但某些情况便能继续发展和扩张
but in some cases conditions become conducive to further expansion.

505
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:45,720
一个巨大的宇宙便能无中生有
That can then create a giant universe out of essentially nothing.

506
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:50,120
但是菲利潘科和其他物理学家
But Filippenko and other physicists

507
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:54,860
提出我们不知道物理定律是如何或何时起源
say we don't know how or when the laws of physics originated.

508
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:56,550
这很重要  
This is significant,

509
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:59,310
因为评论家们说自发创世
because critics say spontaneous creation

510
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:03,310
要求在大爆炸前就有自然规则存在
requires nature to exist prior to the Big Bang.

511
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:06,300
霍金所说的虚无
The nothingness Hawking is talking about

512
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:10,390
是一种由物理定律支配的量子真空
is a quantum vacuum ruled by physical laws.

513
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,160
就好比说
It's like saying,

514
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:17,810
我有一个银行账户  但不幸的是
"I have a bank account, but unfortunately

515
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:20,550
这个账户里没有钱
in my bank account I have a zero Balance."

516
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:22,400
那是否意味着
Does that mean that

517
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:24,250
罗伯特・斯皮策神父  
玛吉斯理性与信仰中心

518
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:26,280
我并没有在真正的银行中有真正的账户呢
I don't have a real bank account in a real bank?

519
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,710
当然不是
Of course not.

520
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:30,330
即便我的余额为零
Just because I have a zero balance,

521
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:33,880
这个账户确实存在于一个真实的银行
the bank account really exists in a real bank.

522
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:37,450
当神学家们谈到
When theologians talk about

523
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:40,300
宇宙起源之前已有的存在
what existed before the beginning of the universe

524
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,060
他们想象宇宙曾是虚空
they imagine it was a true void.

525
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,630
宇宙曾是虚空
The universe was really nothing,

526
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:51,310
那意味着有某物超越了宇宙
that implies something beyond the universe,

527
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:55,720
创造了宇宙
something transcending the universe created it,

528
00:30:55,730 --> 00:31:00,580
将宇宙从虚无发展至有物质
to move it from nothing to something when it was nothing.

529
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:05,500
这个超常的实体就是上帝
And that transcendent entity, well, that would be God.

530
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,310
史蒂芬・霍金  
Stephen Hawking responds

531
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:12,040
以一个令人吃惊的高雅理论予以回击
with an elegant and startling theory

532
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:17,010
可以用一个南加州的地标性建筑来说明
that can be demonstrated inside a southern California landmark.

533
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:21,110
我在洛杉矶格里菲斯天文台的
I'm walking under the planetarium dome of

534
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:23,770
天文馆圆顶下行走
Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles.

535
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:26,070
劳拉・丹莉
格里菲斯天文台

536
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:27,860
这圆顶很好地说明了 
The dome gives a good illustration of one idea for the origin of the universe

537
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:30,530
宇宙起源的无边界假设论
called, "The no boundary proposal."

538
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:35,020
目前最成熟的宇宙起源论告诉我们
Our best theory for the origin of the universe tells us

539
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:38,180
宇宙源自于一个点
that the universe came from a single point.

540
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:42,390
一切物质  空间  时间  能量
All matter, space, time, energy,

541
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:44,810
甚至物理定律
and even the laws of physics

542
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:49,350
似乎都是从这个点爆发出来的
seem to have exploded into existence from that single point.

543
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:55,320
然而  当科学家们用物理基本定律
However, when scientists use the classical laws of physics

544
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,900
解释大爆炸是如何发生的
to figure out how the Big Bang started,

545
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:00,560
他们遭遇了
they encounter what's called

546
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,420
奇点
"A singularity"--

547
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,150
在那里物理定律似乎无效
a place where the laws of physics seem to break down

548
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:09,310
理论上必须有一个超常的上帝
and a transcendent God is theoretically

549
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:11,670
来驱动这一切
needed to start the universe.

550
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,310
这对科学家来说真的是个问题
This is a real problem for scientists,

551
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,210
但是史蒂芬・霍金
but Stephen Hawking

552
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:19,770
和其他无边界假设的支持者们
and other proponents of the "No boundary proposal"

553
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:21,770
为此找到了一个办法
have found a way around this

554
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:25,290
他们说宇宙并非始于一个奇点
by saying that the universe didn't begin in a singularity.

555
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:29,490
他们说宇宙的初始并非一个点
They say the beginning of the universe wasn't a point.

556
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:31,510
而是更像个圆顶
It was more like a dome.

557
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:36,400
大爆炸一发生  时空就扭曲到一起
Just after the Big Bang, space and time curved together.

558
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,360
另一点不易理解的是
As hard as it is to imagine,

559
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:43,190
霍金说时间是空间的另一个维度
Hawking says time actually started out as another dimension of space.

560
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,130
根据无边界假设  
With the no boundary proposal,

561
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:49,540
物理定律一直有效
there was never a time when the laws of physics didn't work.

562
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:52,810
空间和时间没有边界  没有边缘
Space and time had no boundary, no edge,

563
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:56,090
没有开始  没有奇点
no beginning, no singularity...

564
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:00,340
所以试图回到宇宙初始
So trying to travel back in time to the beginning of the universe

565
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:03,940
就像试图去往北极的北边
is like trying to travel north of the north pole

566
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:07,630
或是达到比圆顶更高的地方
or, in this analogy higher than the top of our perfect dome.

567
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:13,230
无法到达  因为根本没有这样的地方
Can't get there, because no such place exists.

568
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:16,930
若沿着宇宙历史 
If you trace the great story back to

569
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,820
回溯到你以为的最初时刻
what you thought was the first moment,

570
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:21,800
一切全都融合成了某种量子模糊
it all merges in some quantum fuzz,

571
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:22,180
保罗・戴维斯 
物理学家    《上帝的心意》作者

572
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,810
所以从未存在一个起点
so there's never a singular switching on.

573
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:29,310
宇宙是自给的  这个观点很恰当
So it's a really neat idea that the universe is, somehow, self-contained.

574
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:33,510
没有以前  时间不能延伸至永恒
There was no before. Time does not extend back for all eternity.

575
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:38,410
空间和时间随宇宙诞生而诞生
Time begins with the universe. Space begins with the universe.

576
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:41,960
所以这样一来  就没有起始的一点
But in such a way that there isn't a single or first moment.

577
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:46,790
若"无边界"理论与"自然发生"论为真
If the "no boundary proposal" and spontaneous creation are true,

578
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:47,990
霍金认为
Hawking says,

579
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,820
宇宙并没有的起点
the universe had no true beginning

580
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:52,680
所以只需遵循物理规律发展
and would have required nothing outside

581
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,250
便能逐渐发展成形
the laws of physics to come into existence.

582
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:59,010
那为何我们需要超自然的造物者呢
So why do we need a transcendent creator?

583
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:05,270
不可能有个人坐在那  然后说
There was no point when someone's sitting there and going,

584
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,570
让宇宙诞生吧
"Let's start a universe."

585
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:08,300
根本不存在这样的时间点
You don't have that point of time anymore.

586
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:11,610
"宇宙是从无到有的" 这一理念也意味着
And the idea that the universe can come spontaneously from nothing

587
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:14,070
不需要上帝去创造一切
also means you don't need a God to make everything.

588
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:17,210
所以  结合二者来看 
So, taken together, those two ideas show that

589
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:19,290
证明我们需要上帝的论点
the standard arguments for why we need a God

590
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,830
是站不住脚的
don't really hold.

591
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,200
霍金和蒙洛迪诺的评论称
Hawking and Mlodinow's critics say

592
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:28,260
"宇宙无边界"假说逻辑十分严谨
the "no boundary proposal" is an elegant theory

593
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,750
有可能是正确的  
that may actually be correct,

594
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,740
但却没能直击要害
but it's beside the point.

595
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,390
他们没有明确说明
You're not really saying that

596
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:39,880
宇宙会无限地回缩至时间之中
the universe extends infinitely backward into time.

597
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,480
其首要观点
All you are saying is that

598
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,590
便是初始阶段一切都处于混沌状态
your initial point is a kind of fuzzy condition.

599
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,240
说白了  
Which quite frankly means

600
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,210
还是存在一个起点的
you still need a beginning.

601
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:54,660
为了反驳史蒂芬・霍金
To counter Stephen Hawking

602
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:56,550
并论证上帝存在说
and support the idea of God,

603
00:34:56,550 --> 00:35:01,050
许多神学家支持BGV定理
many theologians signed the Borde-Guth-Vilenkin Theorem.

604
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:05,030
它由三位杰出的主流物理学家所提出
Formulated by three prominent mainstream physicists,

605
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:07,950
阐述了"任何一个膨胀宇宙
it states that any expanding universe

606
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:09,700
必有其起源"这一观点
must have have had a beginning.

607
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:14,470
他们认为  这是真理 
This is true, they say,

608
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:17,420
即使这个宇宙处于多重宇宙的环境中
even if the universe is part of a multi-verse,

609
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:21,610
只要其它宇宙也在同时膨胀
as long as those universes are also expanding.

610
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:26,920
其所展示的每个膨胀中的宇宙模型
What they showed was that every inflating universal model

611
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,970
定会需要引入时间的边界
would have to have a boundary to pass time.

612
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:34,310
即使这一边界将是向
And even if that boundary only indicated a transition

613
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:35,530
向新型物理学的过渡
to a new kind of physics,

614
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:41,720
即使在那个环境下  仍然需要边界 
even that condition would require some kind of boundary to past time,

615
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:45,090
所以在宇宙处于虚无状态之前
so eventually you are going to get to a beginning,

616
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:47,630
终归需要一个开始
prior to which the universe was nothing,

617
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:52,340
即某种超自然的力量推动了宇宙形成
implying some sort of transcendent force to create it.

618
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:55,090
争论的两派
With each side of this debate

619
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:57,820
对于宇宙的初始和上帝的存在
citing their own complicated mathematical evidence

620
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:01,250
各执己见  各有复杂的方程
about a possible beginning and a possible creator,

621
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,520
究竟谁的方程式才是正确的
whose equations are right?

622
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:07,330
史蒂芬・霍金的阐述得很好
Stephen Hawking expresses this very well.

623
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:11,510
我们对于虚拟世界有各种先进的数学描述
We have all this contending mathematical descriptions of possible worlds.

624
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:15,830
究竟是什么使得其中一组方程式成立
What is it that breathes fire into one particular set of equations

625
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:17,720
从而造就了整个宇宙呢
and makes a universe form all together?

626
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,510
这个问题问得好
That's a good question.

627
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:27,230
究竟是什么让这些方程的成为现实
What is it that literally breathed reality into these equations

628
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:29,090
让它们发挥作用
that enabled them to do something,

629
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:32,980
使之持续升温  乃至爆炸  形成宇宙  
to burn, to explode, to become a universe?

630
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:35,290
真是问到点子上了
That's a very good question,

631
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:39,960
这暗示着超自然造物主的存在
and it does imply a transcendent creator.

632
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:44,920
有关是否存在超自然的上帝
This debate about whether a transcendent God

633
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:49,650
或是物理定律使得宇宙成型的争论
or the laws of physics alone breathed fire into the universe

634
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:54,570
只有在我们找到确凿证据后才会停止
will rage until we find definitive evidence one way or the other.

635
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:59,880
但一些物理学家却提出了第三种惊人可能
But some physicists have come up with an intriguing third possibility.

636
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,630
听起来可能匪夷所思
As mind boggling as it sounds,

637
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:06,680
他们认为宇宙可能是由外星物种所创造  
they say the universe may have been created by an alien species,

638
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:12,130
由于它过于先进  以至于人类无法察觉出来
so advanced it's become indistinguishable from nature itself.

639
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:21,440
物理学家们在寻找有关
As physicists search for answers to fundamental questions

640
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,480
宇宙起源解答
about the beginning of the universe

641
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:26,400
并试图解释上帝是否参与其中时
and the role a God may have played in it.

642
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:30,360
有人曾提出与先进外星文明接触后
Some wondered how this quest would change

643
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:34,290
我们现在的探索任务将如何改变
if we made contact with an advanced alien civilization.

644
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:41,370
保罗・戴维斯 
物理学家    《上帝的心意》作者

645
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:39,000
我始终坚信  如果我们在外太空
There is no doubt in my mind that if we discovered the

646
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,700
追寻到了其他高等生物的踪迹
existence of other intelligent beings out there in the universe,

647
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,460
那将是科学探索史的巅峰
it would be the greatest scientific discovery of all time,

648
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:48,370
但同时也将不可避免地影响各大宗教体系
but it would inevitably have an impact on the world's religions,

649
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,690
因为这些宗教只关乎一个物种  人类
because these refer to human beings, one species,

650
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:55,030
只存于一颗星球  地球
and planet earth, one planet.

651
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:59,430
难免如此  因为宗教建立之初
Inevitably so, because the religions were put together at a time

652
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:01,170
人们只知道地球和人类
when that was all anybody knew.

653
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:05,080
先进文明外星物种是否 
But would an advanced alien species

654
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,500
也会向迥异的神明或诸神祈祷呢
pray to an entirely different God or set of gods...

655
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:14,370
更进一步说  其科技是否已发达到
Or, more profoundly, would they have such an incredible grasp of science

656
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:18,900
能够证明所谓的神明是不存在的
that they've proven a divine consciousness does not exist?

657
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,320
我认为我们探测不到
I don't think we're gonna discover any surprising facts

658
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:25,730
罗伯特・斯皮策神父  
玛吉斯理性与信仰中心

659
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:25,280
发达外星文明的新奇信息
from an intelligent, developed alien culture,

660
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:29,700
它们和我们一样对超自然有着同等追求
because I think they're going to have the same transcendent desires that we do.

661
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:35,080
即使遇见了所谓真正存在的外星人 
I'm not sure that meeting extraterrestrials, if they exist,

662
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:38,280
也未必能让我们进一步认识上帝
will give us any more insight on God.

663
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:38,330
劳拉・丹莉
格里菲斯天文台

664
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:42,680
在新旧世界对话之时  我们就是如此
We've more or less done that already when the old world met the new world,

665
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:45,990
新世界的居民所信奉的神明
and the denizens of the new world observed certain gods,

666
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,390
与旧世界居民所信奉的神明是不同的
and they were different from the denizens of the old world.

667
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:51,210
每每遇到新文化的撞击  
Every time we encounter a new culture,

668
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:53,160
我们能从中汲取新的元素
we learn new things about that culture

669
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:56,630
感受它如何崇拜上帝  描述上帝
and how it appreciates and describes God.

670
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:01,300
但首要问题应该是
But perhaps a more pressing question

671
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:05,660
外星人是否就是人类所寻找的创世者
is whether aliens might be the God that people have been seeking,

672
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:10,020
即创造宇宙的实体
the entity that created the universe.

673
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,060
可以想象在遥远的将来
We can imagine the very far future

674
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:16,880
科学发展到了这个程度 
where science advances to the point

675
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:19,760
人类不仅能够操控周围的物质
where we cannot just manipulate matter locally around us,

676
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,140
但我们能创造整个宇宙
but we could make entire universes.

677
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:26,660
我们可以根据喜好进行设计创造
We could design them and create them to our own liking.

678
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:31,570
倘若还能将自由选取物理学规律
And if this manipulation extends to choosing the laws of physics themselves,

679
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:35,440
我们甚至可以创造出前所未有的宇宙
well, we could make universes of a sort that maybe may have never existed.

680
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,760
我们可以自行设计和创造
We could make and design our universes.

681
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,730
这个想法暂且还太过空泛
Now, this is wild and speculative stuff,

682
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:42,920
但根据弦论预测  这并不十分遥远
but it's actually not so very far of what string theory predicts.

683
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,780
也许某天  我们真能创造出一个全新的宇宙
Perhaps we will someday be able to create a new universe,

684
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:50,460
就像是一项物理学工程项目
almost as if it was a physics project.

685
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,680
科学家们最终也能够
Scientist could eventually focus enough energy

686
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:56,340
全神贯注于微观世界
on a microscopically small space

687
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,820
在我们的宇宙创造出黑洞
to create a black hole in our universe,

688
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:00,920
那么在空间的另一边  
well on the other side,

689
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:04,400
就有大爆炸创造一个新宇宙
a Big Bang would create another universe.

690
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:09,590
进一步猜想应该是这样
Well, it's just a small step from this to the speculation

691
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:13,240
也许我们的宇宙可能是由另一宇宙的
that maybe our universe is the product of a super duper intelligence

692
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,460
超高等生物所创造
that existed in another universe.

693
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:20,330
若这一假想是真的
If this speculation turns out to be true,

694
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:22,780
它便是古印度教义中所传授的那样
it would echo the ancient hindu teaching

695
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,570
世间存在着无穷个宇宙
that there are an infinite number of universes,

696
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:29,980
拥有独立的神明  幻化各自的宙宇
each with a different God, dreaming its own cosmic dream.

697
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:34,420
但这个所谓的超自然神明 
But would this God be the transcendent being

698
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:37,620
会不会就是众人想象中的创世者
that many people imagine our creator is

699
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:41,130
或者仅仅是一个先进的物种
or would it simply be an advanced mortal?

700
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:45,610
母亲诞下孩子
Well, a mother creates a child and

701
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:49,170
并不意味着她就是孩子的上帝
that doesn't mean that mother is the God to that child.

702
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:54,000
我们在地球上诞生
We are all created out of the Earth.

703
00:40:54,970 --> 00:40:58,060
并不意味着地球就是上帝
That doesn't mean that the Earth is God.

704
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:05,370
就算存在诸神  掌管这多重宇宙
Even if you did have multiple gods thinking of multiple universes,

705
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:11,000
在逻辑上还是应该存在某种超神
you're still going to logically have to have some super God

706
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,070
创造诸神
that's thinking all of the other gods

707
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:18,730
并创造诸神所掌管的宇宙
into existence along with all of the universes about which they are thinking.

708
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:24,350
当然  著名的印度教义还说道
Of course, the famous hindu teaching goes on to say

709
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:26,990
万物可能相反
that everything may be reversed

710
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:30,460
并非诸神庇佑众生 
that people might not be the dreams of the gods,

711
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:34,160
亦可众生庇佑诸神
but that the gods might be the dreams of people.

712
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:40,550
这是人类正在试图探求的重要问题
This is the fundamental question that people are trying to answer.

713
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:44,680
是我们一直在憧憬这神圣秩序
Are we just dreaming about a divine order to the universe?

714
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:49,230
还是它成为我们的精神枷锁
Or is the divine order drawing us to it?

715
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:53,380
如果一项假说最终无法
Ultimately the point is if there's no way to scientifically

716
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:57,490
通过实验观察的检验
test a hypothesis through experiments and observations,

717
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:00,790
这就不能算是科学假说
it's not truly a scientific hypothesis.

718
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:02,690
亚历克・菲力彭科
加州大学伯克利分校

719
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:05,020
因而  关于起源与创世者的问题
And so, since the question of the ultimate origin and the

720
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:08,740
基本上是无法通过实验检测出来的
ultimate creator is fundamentally an untestable question,

721
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:11,460
它就不能算是科学
it's really not part of science.

722
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:17,880
科学无法反证超越宇宙的事物
Science cannot disprove something which is beyond our universe,

723
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:19,720
其原因在于
and the reason is,

724
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:22,840
它身在宇宙之中
it's taking its data

725
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:25,730
又只能采用宇宙内部的数据
from within the universe itself.

726
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:27,640
这不等于在说  
I mean that's tempt to saying,

727
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:33,370
卡通人物要用动画片中的例证
"Oh, the cartoon character is going to use data from the cartoon

728
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:35,690
去推翻漫画家的立场
to disprove the cartoonist".

729
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,240
这是不可能的
It just simply can't be done.

730
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:44,720
随着科学进步  上帝的能力逐步减弱
The role of God has been pushed back by the advance of science.

731
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,650
不过  这并不是科学与上帝之战
Nevertheless, it is not a battle between the two.

732
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:49,480
克利福德・强森
南加州大学

733
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:51,430
人类将一直处于对未知世界的探索阶段
I don't think there'll ever be a time when we understand everything.

734
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:55,270
世界上总会存在未解之谜
I think there'll always be the unknown.

735
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:57,150
我们也会有无能为力之处
There'll always be a frontier.

736
00:42:57,150 --> 00:43:00,780
所以现阶段我们总会有
So there will always be questions that are beyond our ability to answer them

737
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,200
未解之事
at a current time,

738
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:03,330
但同时也有希望  
but then there's always hope

739
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:05,580
我们能在未来更好的了解这些事物
that we might explain things better.

740
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,310
物理学和数学永远都解释不了
Physics and mathematics can never explain

741
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,070
定律与逻辑从何而来
where the laws or where logic came from.

742
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:12,260
因为这是一切的初始
That's where we start from, and

743
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:14,610
如果有人要说  上帝创造了万物  
if people want to say, "Well, that must come from God,"

744
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:15,650
伦纳德・曼罗迪诺
 《大设计》合著者

745
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:17,050
我们肯定不会去辩驳他
We certainly don't argue against that.

746
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:18,430
从某些方面来说  物理定律就像
In some ways, the laws of physics

747
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:20,970
神学家心中的上帝一般永恒不灭
are as eternal as God is to a theologian.

748
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,200
但我们可以想象  存在于世间
But we could imagine that there's something underpinning

749
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,840
维持并解释自然规律的因素
the laws of nature, upholding them, explaining them.

750
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,740
为什么它们是数学层面的
Why are they mathematical?

751
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,780
为什么它们自身性质会是这样
Why do they have the properties that they do?

752
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:33,390
为什么它们又是浅显易懂
Why are they intelligible?

753
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,410
上帝不一定就是问题的答案
I'm not sure God is the right answer to this,

754
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:37,450
因为上帝是文化的产物
'cause of the cultural baggage that goes with it,

755
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:42,870
我认为  就这样接受了匪夷所思之事
but I do think that accepting the universe and its underlying laws

756
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:45,190
即宇宙及其内部的定律
are package of marvels that just happens to be,

757
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:46,810
太不求甚解了
is deeply unsatisfying.

758
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:48,620
我们一定要超越自我
I think we must go beyond,

759
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:50,580
我们一定能超越自我
and I think we can go beyond.
