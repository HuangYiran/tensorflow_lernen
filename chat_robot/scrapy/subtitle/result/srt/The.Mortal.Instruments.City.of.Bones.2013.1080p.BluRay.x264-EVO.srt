嗯，我知道
Yeah, no, I know,

6
00:01:06,712 --> 00:01:08,549
可是我正要按你說的去做的
but when you tell me to do something, I'm gonna do it,

7
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:09,953
我馬上給他發郵件

嗯，我不知道他什麼時候回復
Well, I don't know how quick he's gonna get back

9
00:01:14,052 --> 00:01:16,179
有時他並不查看郵箱，所以…
'cause you know sometimes he doesn't check, so...

10
00:01:17,014 --> 00:01:18,760
好，詩朗誦會結束
Yeah, and after the poetry reading,

11
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,683
我不回家
I'm not going home.

12
00:01:19,766 --> 00:01:21,872
我是說，今天我生日
I mean, it's my birthday,

13
00:01:21,872 --> 00:01:23,979
我想去夜總會

14
00:01:27,149 --> 00:01:29,735
不，西蒙，我不想對她撒謊
No, Simon, I'm not gonna lie to her.

15
00:01:29,818 --> 00:01:32,904
我不告訴她就行了呀
I'm just not gonna tell her.

16
00:01:36,491 --> 00:01:38,160
我來停車
Let me go park the truck.

17
00:01:38,785 --> 00:01:41,121
- 等會見，好嗎？  - 好

18
00:01:53,383 --> 00:01:55,427
喂，多蘿西，你好嗎？
Hi, Dorothea, how are you?

19
00:01:58,805 --> 00:02:00,974
好吧，我很好，謝了
I'm good, thanks for asking.

20
00:02:01,183 --> 00:02:03,644
我去打電話，多要張門票
So I'll just call, I guess, and get extra tickets.

21
00:02:03,727 --> 00:02:05,103
好，就這樣
Yeah, sure.

22
00:02:05,187 --> 00:02:06,855
- 我馬上做  - 你好
- I'll do it right now. - Hey, you.

23
00:02:06,938 --> 00:02:08,023

25

你好，西蒙
Hi, Simon.

26
00:02:11,943 --> 00:02:13,695
他說：「會打電話給我」
He says, "Call me."

27
00:02:14,988 --> 00:02:16,823
是啊，是啊，我媽回來了
Yeah, yeah, she just got home.

28
00:02:16,907 --> 00:02:19,493
她肯定聽得到，她就站在這兒
I'm sure she can hear you, she's standing right here.

29
00:02:20,118 --> 00:02:21,870
- 你好，盧克  - 你好，克拉蕾
- Hey, Luke. - How's it going, Clary?

30
00:02:21,953 --> 00:02:23,316
沒，我馬上換衣服
No, I'll get dressed quick.

31
00:02:23,316 --> 00:02:24,498
要咖啡嗎？
Do you want some coffee?

32
00:02:24,581 --> 00:02:25,916
你再講我就得遲到了
If we keep talking, I'm gonna be late.

33
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:28,210
就那兒見，拜拜
Yeah, I'll meet you there. Bye.

34
00:02:44,976 --> 00:02:46,561
你是不是用了…
Did you just use the...

35
00:02:46,645 --> 00:02:48,271
你覺得呢？
How are you feeling?

36
00:02:48,355 --> 00:02:49,690
好吧，為什麼？
Fine, why?

37
00:02:52,025 --> 00:02:54,528
記得晚上直接回來
You make sure you come straight home tonight.

38
00:02:54,611 --> 00:02:57,614
拜託，媽媽 只是個詩歌朗誦會
Mom, come on. Just a poetry reading.

39
00:02:58,115 --> 00:02:59,241

00:03:05,622 --> 00:03:06,748
拜拜
Bye.

41
00:03:10,252 --> 00:03:11,670
喬絲琳，你需要跟她談談
You need to talk to her, Jocelyn.

42
00:03:14,881 --> 00:03:16,925
不行，她還沒準備好
She's not ready, not yet.

43
00:03:17,008 --> 00:03:18,427
不，她準備好了
Yes, she is.

44
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,928
沒好的是你
You're not.

45
00:03:23,223 --> 00:03:25,019
另外，謝謝你能來
By the way, thanks for doing this.

46
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:26,560
他很在意詩朗誦會
His poetry means a lot to him.

47
00:03:26,643 --> 00:03:27,894
誰叫我們是朋友
That's what friends are for.

48
00:03:28,812 --> 00:03:30,063

00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,790
我聽不下去了，要再來杯咖啡嗎？
I can't listen to this. You want another coffee?

57
00:03:48,874 --> 00:03:50,250
好
Yeah.

58
00:03:50,834 --> 00:03:54,004
「包裹著的藏紅花瓣，低聲訴說死亡…」
"Like tiny crocus petals whisper death"

59
00:03:54,087 --> 00:03:55,088
卡布奇諾和濃咖啡

「雨落大地」

61
00:03:59,134 --> 00:04:02,095
「寒風穿過致病的壁毯」
"Shivering breezes weave through a morbid tapestry

62
00:04:02,179 --> 00:04:03,555
「潰爛化膿」

63
00:04:05,098 --> 00:04:07,350
「我痛苦，全身腫脹」
"Turgid is my torment"

64
00:04:07,684 --> 00:04:08,810
好了
There you go.

65
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:10,604
謝謝
Thank you.

66

「雨落大地…」
"Rain drowns the earth..."

67
00:04:13,231 --> 00:04:16,276
剛才那金髮女孩蠻喜歡你啊
That blonde girl over there was totally flirting with you.

68
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:17,486
約她出來
Ask her out.

69
00:04:17,861 --> 00:04:20,197
- 不，那不公平  - 為什麼？
- Nah, it wouldn't be fair. - Why?

70
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,865
嗯，因為…
Well, because...

71
00:04:22,783 --> 00:04:24,743
為了某人，我得空著自己
Because I'm saving myself for someone else.

72
00:04:24,826 --> 00:04:25,786
誰？
Who?

我覺得更不好
Think he's getting worse.

77
00:04:42,867 --> 00:04:45,096
你是他好友，得跟他講
As his friend, you should probably tell him.

78
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,943
也許他詩歌很棒
Maybe his poetry is great,

79
00:04:46,943 --> 00:04:48,642
我們不懂欣賞吧
we just don't know it yet.

80
00:04:51,186 --> 00:04:52,646
進去看看
Let's go in here.

81
00:04:52,729 --> 00:04:54,564
我想問下這符號的意思
I want to ask what that symbol means.

82
00:04:54,648 --> 00:04:56,274
克拉蕾，我們不該進去
Clary, we'll never get in.

83
00:04:56,358 --> 00:04:58,485
你個擔心鬼
Such the eternal optimist.

84
00:04:59,236 --> 00:05:00,570
這可不像你
This is so not like you.

85
00:05:00,695 --> 00:05:02,739
就去這一次啦
Just go with it for once.

86
00:05:04,658 --> 00:05:07,577
這符號代表什麼？
What does that symbol mean?

87
00:05:11,414 --> 00:05:14,000
- 什麼符號？  - 嗯，哪�有符號？
- What symbol? - Yeah, what symbol?

88
00:05:14,084 --> 00:05:15,788
就在那兒 你沒… 你沒看見嗎？
It's right there. You don't... You don't see it?

89
00:05:16,552 --> 00:05:16,795
沒
No.

90
00:05:21,591 --> 00:05:22,884
酷斃了
Hey, that was cool.

91
00:05:31,476 --> 00:05:33,395
嘿，我們進來了
Yeah, we're fitting in.

92
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:35,272
跟著跳 跟著跳
Move it, go with it.

93
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,483
克拉蕾，要來一杯嗎？
Clary, you want a drink?

94
00:05:38,567 --> 00:05:39,651
好
Yeah.

95
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:20,585
克拉蕾，克拉蕾，那是什麼
Clary, Clary, what is it?

96
00:07:26,049 --> 00:07:27,717
你沒看到嗎？
You didn't see that?

97
00:07:32,347 --> 00:07:33,063
我真的看到
I know what I saw.

98
00:07:33,063 --> 00:07:34,724
讓我們進去的那個男孩被殺了
They killed the guy that let us in the club.

99
00:07:34,808 --> 00:07:36,726
- 你是喝迷幻藥了？  - 天啦，我沒喝，西蒙
- Did you drink something? - Yeah... No, Simon.

100
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:37,957
你知道，以前我就聽說過
You know, I've heard sometimes

101
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,771
有人把迷幻藥注射到他們鼻子�
they pump hallucinogenic stuff into the air vents

102
00:07:39,854 --> 00:07:41,147
這樣玩會很刺激
to make sure people have a good time.

103
00:07:41,231 --> 00:07:42,230
好了，那你怎會沒事？
Okay, then how come you're fine?

104
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,108
我倆呼吸的是不同的空氣？
Did we breathe different air?

105
00:07:43,191 --> 00:07:45,068
我不懂，回家好了
I don't know. Let's just go home.

106
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,867
- 你沒事吧？  - 沒事
- You okay?   - Yeah, fine.

107
00:09:16,493 --> 00:09:18,745
你整整睡了一天
You've been sleeping all day.

108
00:09:19,037 --> 00:09:21,039
而且你昨晚很遲回來
And you didn't come home till late last night.

109
00:09:21,122 --> 00:09:23,249
是的，不過我有回來，對吧？
Yeah, well, I'm home, okay?

110
00:09:24,876 --> 00:09:26,419
不准走
Well, you can't go.

111
00:09:26,503 --> 00:09:27,566
我賣了另一幅畫
Well, I sold another painting.

112
00:09:27,566 --> 00:09:28,630
一塊去慶祝一下
I wanted to celebrate with you.

113
00:09:28,713 --> 00:09:30,131
慶祝你唯一的買家？
To what, your one buyer?

114
00:09:30,215 --> 00:09:31,151
好吧，他是誰？
Who is this guy anyway?

115
00:09:31,151 --> 00:09:33,259
他買你畫估計是愛上你了
He probably just buys your stuff 'cause he's into you.

116
00:09:33,343 --> 00:09:35,595
你肯定像哄盧克那樣哄他的吧
I'm sure you'll just string him along like you do with Luke.

117
00:09:35,678 --> 00:09:37,801
你幹嘛非得那樣說？
You really want to have that conversation?

118
00:09:37,801 --> 00:09:39,265
那什麼意思？
What's that supposed to mean?

119
00:09:39,349 --> 00:09:41,434
- 西蒙  - 他就像我哥
- Simon. - He's like my brother.

120
00:09:41,518 --> 00:09:42,852
我可不認為他這麼想
I doubt he feels that way.

121
00:09:43,853 --> 00:09:45,063
好吧，不過我要走了
Okay, well, I'm gonna go.

122
00:09:45,146 --> 00:09:47,440
- 不，不，別走  - 別犯傻了
- No, no, you can't. - This is ridiculous.

123
00:09:47,524 --> 00:09:50,068
- 你去哪�？  - 我只是去加瓦-瓊斯咖啡廳
- Where are you going? - I'm just going to Java Jones.

124
00:09:50,568 --> 00:09:52,195
- 我的天！  - 不，是我
- Jesus!     - No, just me.

125
00:09:52,278 --> 00:09:53,363
走吧，西蒙
Come on, Simon.

126
00:09:53,446 --> 00:09:56,157
克拉蕾 我有些事想告訴你，好嗎？
Clary. There's something I want to tell you, okay?

127
00:09:57,992 --> 00:09:59,452
以後再說啦
We can talk about this later.

128
00:09:59,536 --> 00:10:01,037
拜拜，弗蕾夫人
Bye, Mrs. Fray.

129
00:10:09,629 --> 00:10:12,257
看，我突然畫了很多這些東西
Look, suddenly I'm drawing hundreds of these things,

130
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,134
我不懂怎麼搞的
and I have no idea what they are.

131
00:10:14,217 --> 00:10:17,220
我不知道… 我想我快瘋了
I don't know. I think I'm going out of my mind.

132
00:10:17,303 --> 00:10:19,639
也許你是《第三類接觸中》的那個主角
You know, maybe you're like the guy in Close Encounters.

133
00:10:19,722 --> 00:10:21,104
大家認為他是妄想狂
Everybody thought he was paranoid,

134
00:10:21,104 --> 00:10:22,684
但結果居然是…
and then there turned out to be, well...

135
00:10:23,393 --> 00:10:25,311
幽浮，挺合理的，就像…
UFO, reasonable, like...

136
00:10:25,395 --> 00:10:27,605
哎，天了，這怎麼可能發生
Oh, God, this isn't happening.

137
00:10:29,149 --> 00:10:31,568
- 怎麼了？  - 這不可能
- What? - This isn't happening.

138
00:10:31,651 --> 00:10:33,236
嘿，現在我被你嚇到了
Okay, now you're freaking me out.

139
00:10:36,573 --> 00:10:37,824
克拉蕾，你是…
Clary, are you...

140
00:10:44,622 --> 00:10:46,040
你在看什麼？
What are you looking at?

141
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,168
在這等我
Wait here.

142
00:11:11,983 --> 00:11:13,985
喬絲，聖盃在哪？
Where's the Cup, Jocie?

143
00:11:21,201 --> 00:11:22,952
你怎麼找到我？
How did you find me?

144
00:11:23,036 --> 00:11:25,747
這得謝你女兒
You can thank your daughter for that.

145
00:11:26,789 --> 00:11:28,124
為何我能看見你而別人不行？
Why can I see you and no one else can?

146
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:30,668
我還想問你呢？
I was going to ask you the same question.

147
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:32,519
我怎麼會跟你說話
I don't even know why I'm talking to you.

148
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:34,005
一個殺人狂，一個冷血殺手
You're a killer, a cold-blooded killer.

149
00:11:34,088 --> 00:11:36,007
有這麼溫和的殺手？
As opposed to a peace-loving killer?

150
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,258
我很明白所看到的
I know what I saw.

151
00:11:37,342 --> 00:11:38,635
你以為你明白
You think you know.

152
00:11:42,138 --> 00:11:43,806
為什麼我會畫這些？
Why am I drawing this?

153
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:48,937
我猜對了，你不是凡人
So I was right, you're not a mundane.

154
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,189
等等，凡人？
Excuse me? What's a mundane?

155
00:11:51,272 --> 00:11:52,831
就是人類
Someone from the human world.

156
00:11:52,831 --> 00:11:54,651
我要不是人類，那我是什麼？
If I'm not a human, then what am I?

157
00:11:57,654 --> 00:11:58,988
去找聖盃
Go find the Cup.

158
00:12:38,861 --> 00:12:40,713
- 什麼時候發生的？  - 不，不
- When did this start? - No, no.

159
00:12:40,713 --> 00:12:41,948
為什麼我會畫這些？
Why am I drawing this?

160
00:12:43,658 --> 00:12:44,993
回答我！
Answer me!

161
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,251
西蒙
Simon.

162
00:13:12,478 --> 00:13:14,814
你或許得接下，可能是你男友
Maybe you should answer that. Could be your boyfriend.

163
00:13:14,897 --> 00:13:17,191
- 他不是我男友  - 那他知道嗎？
- He's not my boyfriend. - Does he know that?

164
00:13:20,236 --> 00:13:22,071
拜託，這很吵
Please. It's annoying.

165
00:13:24,407 --> 00:13:25,575
媽，我要回來了
Mom, I'm coming home.

166
00:13:25,658 --> 00:13:26,862
不，不，不 你不能回家
No, no, no. You can't come home.

167
00:13:26,862 --> 00:13:28,286
聽到了嗎？別回來
You understand me? You don't come home.

168
00:13:28,369 --> 00:13:29,014
告訴盧克
You call Luke.

169
00:13:29,014 --> 00:13:31,080
說瓦倫丁復活了，他會找到我
Tell him Valentine's alive and that he found me.

170
00:13:32,206 --> 00:13:33,207
我愛你
I love you.

171
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:34,667
- 媽！ - 不，不！
- Mom!    - No, no!

172
00:13:34,751 --> 00:13:35,960
媽！
Mom!

173
00:13:43,009 --> 00:13:45,219
告訴瓦倫丁他不可能拿到聖盃
You tell Valentine he'll never have the Cup.

174
00:13:47,555 --> 00:13:49,516
別喝… 別喝…
Don't you... Don't drink...

175
00:13:49,516 --> 00:13:51,267
過來！別… 什麼？
Come here! Don't... What?

176
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,565
快點！
Come on.

177
00:14:18,461 --> 00:14:20,755
對不起 對不起 你還好嗎？
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You okay?

178
00:14:20,838 --> 00:14:23,007
沒事，別動，好嗎？
All right, look, don't move, all right?

179
00:14:43,986 --> 00:14:45,029
媽？
Mom?

180
00:14:49,534 --> 00:14:50,618
媽？
Mom?

181
00:17:28,317 --> 00:17:30,653
來，起來
Come on. Come on.

182
00:17:35,157 --> 00:17:38,160
夠了！夠了！夠了！
That's enough! That's enough. That's enough.

183
00:17:39,579 --> 00:17:40,913
它死了
It's dead.

184
00:17:42,832 --> 00:17:44,750
那該死的到底是什麼？
What the hell was that?

185
00:17:46,377 --> 00:17:48,504
我說了你肯定不信
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

186
00:17:48,588 --> 00:17:49,797
說說看
Try me.

187
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,093
它是邪靈
It was a demon.

188
00:17:56,596 --> 00:17:58,055
你說得對
You're right.

189
00:17:58,806 --> 00:18:00,558
我不信你
I don't believe you.

190
00:18:01,517 --> 00:18:03,102
而那個東西
And that thing,

191
00:18:03,185 --> 00:18:05,688
你在夜總會看到我殺死的那個…
that you saw me kill at the club, that...

192
00:18:06,689 --> 00:18:08,566
也是一隻邪靈
That was also a demon.

193
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,652
邪靈會附身任何活物
Demons can take possession of any living creature.

194
00:18:11,736 --> 00:18:13,654
你誰都不能信
You can't trust anyone.

195
00:18:13,738 --> 00:18:16,073
即使那人你很熟悉
Even people you think you know.

196
00:18:16,157 --> 00:18:18,242
那我幹嘛要信你？
So, why should I trust you?

197
00:18:23,247 --> 00:18:25,166
因為我剛才救過你
I did just save your life.

198
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,838
多蘿西，快開開門
Dorothea, open up, please.

199
00:18:33,883 --> 00:18:34,925
你能…
Can you...

200
00:18:38,846 --> 00:18:41,390
你知道我媽發生了什麼嗎？
Do you know what happened to my mom?

201
00:18:45,186 --> 00:18:46,395
你知道嗎？
Do you?

202
00:18:48,022 --> 00:18:49,446
等等，你可以看到他？
Wait, you can see this guy?

203
00:18:49,446 --> 00:18:51,108
當然可以 她是女巫
Of course she can. She's a witch.

204
00:18:55,571 --> 00:18:58,199
從姜餅套房降級到了單臥室？
Downgraded from a gingerbread house to a one-bedroom?

205
00:18:58,741 --> 00:19:00,159
你知道我媽在哪�嗎？
Do you know where my mom is?

206
00:19:00,242 --> 00:19:01,827
對不起，我不清楚
Sorry. I have no idea.

207
00:19:01,911 --> 00:19:04,580
嗯，她曾提到一個名字… 瓦倫丁
Well, she mentioned a name... Valentine.

208
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,541
- 你最好離開  - 不，請不要這樣
- You better leave. - No, please.

209
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:10,461
你不告訴我，我就不走
Not until you tell me something, anything.

210
00:19:40,032 --> 00:19:41,992
看看骨牌占卜到什麼
Let's see what the cards have to say.

211
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:44,537
對不起，我不信這些…
I'm sorry, but you know that I don't believe in any of...

212
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,746
坐下
Sit.

213
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:50,000
把手在牌上過一遍
Run your hands over the cards.

214
00:19:55,089 --> 00:19:56,590
我媽媽畫過這些
My mom painted these.

215
00:19:56,674 --> 00:19:58,342
是的，你媽媽送的
Yes. They were a gift.

216
00:19:59,719 --> 00:20:02,388
看看你拿到哪一張牌
Let's see which card gets picked.

217
00:20:29,373 --> 00:20:30,666
大金盃
The Ace of Cups.

218
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,419
- 那是聖盃  - 那？
- That's the Mortal Cup. - So?

219
00:20:33,502 --> 00:20:34,587
別理他
Ignore him.

220
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:35,581
這是聖盃神器
It's a Mortal Instrument,

221
00:20:35,581 --> 00:20:37,089
我們族人三大聖物之一
one of the three holy objects of my people.

222
00:20:37,173 --> 00:20:38,257
它怎麼在這兒？
What's it doing here?

223
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,593
我不明白這跟我媽有什麼關聯
I don't understand what any of this has to do with my mom.

224
00:20:40,676 --> 00:20:43,596
你母親是暗影獵人，跟他一樣
Your mother was a Shadowhunter, like him.

225
00:20:44,013 --> 00:20:45,973
不，我媽是個畫家
No, my mom is a painter.

226
00:20:46,056 --> 00:20:48,225
她從沒跟你說過，對吧？
She never told you any of this, did she?

227
00:20:48,309 --> 00:20:49,777
我只知道的是她消失了
All I know is that she's gone,

228
00:20:49,777 --> 00:20:52,146
然後我不知道去哪�找她
and I have no idea where to start looking for her.

229
00:20:55,566 --> 00:20:57,026
讓我給你讀心
Let me read you.

230
00:21:20,049 --> 00:21:22,635
有東西封印了你的回憶
There's something blocking your mind.

231
00:21:23,052 --> 00:21:26,305
我猜是你媽媽僱請了高人來保護你
My guess is your mother hired someone very skilled to protect you.

232
00:21:26,388 --> 00:21:28,432
- 保護什麼？  - 你的回憶
- From what? - Your own memories.

233
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,726
為什麼？
Why?

234
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:33,771
我不懂她要我忘記什麼
I don't remember anything she'd want me to forget.

235
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,376
等等
Wait.

236
00:21:56,377 --> 00:21:57,920
很高興見到你
Nice to meet you.

237
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,351
搞什麼？
What the hell?

238
00:22:13,018 --> 00:22:14,478
你嚇到我了
You scared me.

239
00:22:14,562 --> 00:22:16,689
這究竟發生過什麼？
What the hell happened here?

240
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,525
- 我媽媽不見了  - 什麼？
- My mom's missing. - What?

241
00:22:19,608 --> 00:22:22,444
有人抓了她，還毀了這�
Someone took her and destroyed the place.

242
00:22:27,408 --> 00:22:30,077
他正幫我找她
This guy is helping me find her,

243
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,621
你看不到他，而且他…
but you can't see him, and he...

244
00:22:33,789 --> 00:22:34,957
克拉蕾
Clary.

245
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:37,001
好吧
Great.

246
00:22:37,084 --> 00:22:38,961
好吧，現在我也看不到他了
Okay, now I can't see him, either.

247
00:22:40,629 --> 00:22:42,715
傑斯·維蘭德，邪靈獵手
Jace Wayland, demon hunter.

248
00:22:45,467 --> 00:22:47,845
西蒙·盧易斯，解鎖師
Simon Lewis, Keymaster.

249
00:22:47,928 --> 00:22:48,975
你是門衛嗎？
Are you the Gatekeeper?

250
00:22:48,975 --> 00:22:50,764
我不懂你在說什麼
I have no idea what you're talking about.

251
00:22:50,848 --> 00:22:53,559
等等 什麼，你現在可以看到他了？
Wait. What, so you can see him now?

252
00:22:53,642 --> 00:22:55,519
- 什麼？我當然能看到他  - 可我以為…
- What? Of course I can see him. - But I thought...

253
00:22:55,603 --> 00:22:57,271
- 不…  - 你說什麼呢？
- No... - What are you talking about?

254
00:22:57,354 --> 00:22:58,898
我被搞糊塗了
This is so confusing.

255
00:22:59,648 --> 00:23:00,816
這是誰？
Who's this?

256
00:23:01,358 --> 00:23:03,360
我爸爸，我兩歲時他就死了
That's my dad. He died when I was two.

257
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:11,535
克拉蕾，等等
Clary, a moment.

258
00:23:11,619 --> 00:23:13,778
等等，你媽消失了
So, wait, your mom is gone,

259
00:23:14,376 --> 00:23:18,500
你卻跟這染金髮的追星小伙在一起？
and you're hanging around with some dyed-blond wannabe Goth weirdo?

260
00:23:19,209 --> 00:23:20,794
你在哪兒遇到他的？
Where'd you come across this guy?

261
00:23:20,878 --> 00:23:24,340
- 不，我沒有 是他找我的  - 什麼？他找你
- No, I didn't. He found me. - What? He found you?

262
00:23:24,423 --> 00:23:26,717
- 不，我知道這聽起來…  - 看看這個
- No, I know it sounds... - You should check this.

263
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,969
鄭重聲明，我頭髮金色是天生的
And for the record, my hair is naturally blond.

264
00:23:31,597 --> 00:23:34,850
克拉蕾，克拉蕾，克拉蕾… 西蒙？
Clary, Clary, Clary... Simon?

265
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:36,644
她打過電話？
She called you?

266
00:23:38,145 --> 00:23:39,480
你為什麼不接？
Why didn't you pick up?

267
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:42,191
要是知道這麼嚴重，我早接了
If I'd known it was serious, I would have picked up.

268
00:23:42,274 --> 00:23:44,360
你都沒接怎麼會知道？
Well, how would you know if you didn't pick it up?

269
00:23:47,363 --> 00:23:48,781
那是什麼？
What's that?

270
00:23:51,742 --> 00:23:53,118
沒好事
Nothing good.

271
00:23:53,661 --> 00:23:55,621
你懂她哪兒弄來這個的嗎？
Do you have any idea where she got this?

272
00:23:55,704 --> 00:23:57,498
我得找盧克
I've got to find Luke.

273
00:24:08,717 --> 00:24:10,636
太奇怪了，他車在這兒
It's so weird. His truck's here.

274
00:24:10,928 --> 00:24:12,262
來吧 這邊
Come on. This way.

275
00:24:14,473 --> 00:24:15,816
不，你在這等
No, you wait here.

276
00:24:15,816 --> 00:24:17,351
幹嘛要聽你的？
Who made you the boss?

277
00:24:18,102 --> 00:24:20,896
沒關係，這樣有人來能通知我們
It's okay. Just let us know if anyone comes.

278
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,805
我認識盧克好多年
I've known Luke all these years,

279
00:24:23,805 --> 00:24:25,693
但我都沒下來過
but I've never been down here.

280
00:24:35,327 --> 00:24:36,495
什麼？
What?

281
00:24:37,037 --> 00:24:38,580
快點，夥計！
Come on, mate!

282
00:24:50,342 --> 00:24:52,011
夥計，聽好…
Now, listen...

283
00:24:52,386 --> 00:24:55,347
你要做的就是說真話
All you got to do, mate, is tell me the truth.

284
00:24:55,431 --> 00:24:57,850
我說了，不知道聖盃在哪兒
I'm telling you, I don't know where the Cup is.

285
00:24:57,933 --> 00:25:00,060
我知道你和喬絲關繫好
I know you and Jocie are close.

286
00:25:00,144 --> 00:25:01,937
我可不是傻子？
I'm not stupid, am I?

287
00:25:02,396 --> 00:25:04,064
別這樣回答
Don't answer that.

288
00:25:04,398 --> 00:25:05,641
聽我說，夥計
Listen to me, mate.

289
00:25:05,641 --> 00:25:07,943
只要告訴我聖盃在哪兒
Just tell me where the Mortal Cup is.

290
00:25:08,652 --> 00:25:10,529
喬絲就會沒事
And then Jocie will be fine.

291
00:25:10,612 --> 00:25:13,164
盧克，說啊，告訴我
Lukey, tell me. Tell me the truth.

292
00:25:13,164 --> 00:25:14,199
我不知道
I don't know.

293
00:25:14,283 --> 00:25:16,368
你可別惹我生氣
You don't want to make me angry.

294
00:25:16,452 --> 00:25:18,662
- 我說了…  - 是嗎？
- I'm telling you... - Do you?

295
00:25:19,955 --> 00:25:22,198
我再問一遍，夥計
I'm going to ask you again, mate,

296
00:25:22,198 --> 00:25:23,584
聖盃在哪兒？
where's the Cup, huh?

297
00:25:23,667 --> 00:25:25,169
我不知道
I don't know.

298
00:25:25,335 --> 00:25:28,839
我們都需要它，盧克，不是嗎？
We all want the same thing, Lukey boy, don't we?

299
00:25:28,922 --> 00:25:32,509
不同之處，我覺得你知道它在哪兒
Difference is, I think you know where it is.

300
00:25:32,718 --> 00:25:33,886
不是嗎？
Don't you?

301
00:25:33,969 --> 00:25:35,971
快點 快點 說啊！
Come on. Come on. Talk!

302
00:25:36,055 --> 00:25:38,807
- 我們得走了  - 不，求你了，你要幫他
- We need to go. - No, please, you have to help him.

303
00:25:38,891 --> 00:25:40,184
你不懂
You don't understand.

304
00:25:40,976 --> 00:25:42,561
他們是瓦倫丁的人
They work for Valentine.

305
00:25:43,312 --> 00:25:45,304
他是個死人 我幫不了他
He's a dead man. I can't help him.

306
00:25:45,304 --> 00:25:46,273
他是我家人
He's like family.

307
00:25:46,356 --> 00:25:48,067
奇了怪
You know what's really amazing

308
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:51,070
你看上去還挺像人類
is how much you actually look like a human.

309
00:25:51,653 --> 00:25:53,197
很棒啊？
Isn't it great?

310
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,828
求你了
Please.

311
00:25:59,912 --> 00:26:01,705
你要發狂了？你要變身了？
Are you gonna get mad? You're going to change?

312
00:26:01,789 --> 00:26:03,165
我要看你變身
I want to see you change.

313
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:06,668
給我露露你怎麼變身的？
Show me how you can change. Huh?

314
00:26:06,752 --> 00:26:09,004
看看 看看
Look at that. Look at that.

315
00:26:10,756 --> 00:26:12,174
狼人來了
Dog boy's coming on.

316
00:26:12,257 --> 00:26:13,425
你想搞我腿？
You want to hump my leg?

317
00:26:13,884 --> 00:26:16,178
你搞我腿？喜歡這樣？
You hump legs? You like that?

318
00:26:16,678 --> 00:26:18,597
要嗅我屁股嗎？
You want to smell my derriere?

319
00:26:22,101 --> 00:26:24,103
我要看你　變身
I want to see you change!

320
00:26:24,937 --> 00:26:27,439
告訴我喬絲琳把聖盃藏哪兒
You just got to tell me where Jocelyn hid the Cup.

321
00:26:27,523 --> 00:26:29,441
然後你可以平安帶回她
Then you can have her back.

322
00:26:29,525 --> 00:26:31,193
她會平安無事的
She'll be safe and sound.

323
00:26:33,862 --> 00:26:35,989
我沒要她回來
I don't want her back.

324
00:26:36,073 --> 00:26:37,658
我一點不在乎
I couldn't care less.

325
00:26:37,741 --> 00:26:40,100
我這麼多年
I have spent years

326
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,080
一直在討好她和她的倔女兒，就是為聖盃
cozying up to that woman and her brat for the Mortal Cup.

327
00:26:43,789 --> 00:26:45,833
潘伯恩，聽我說
Pangborn, listen to me.

328
00:26:45,916 --> 00:26:48,502
我也想把聖盃給瓦倫丁
I want to be the one to give her to Valentine.

329
00:26:48,627 --> 00:26:50,045
呀，對
Yeah, right.

330
00:26:53,257 --> 00:26:55,717
你在犯大錯
You are making a big mistake.

331
00:26:55,801 --> 00:26:57,928
我不信，你信他嗎？
I don't believe you. Do you believe him?

332
00:27:05,602 --> 00:27:07,146
- 克拉蕾，快跑！  - 克拉蕾，聽我說！
- Clary, run!          - Clary, listen!

333
00:27:18,866 --> 00:27:21,034
勞駕 警官？
Excuse me. Officer?

334
00:27:21,743 --> 00:27:23,704
我要報案，有人闖入
I'd like to report a break-in.

335
00:27:24,246 --> 00:27:25,706
一人失蹤
And a missing person.

336
00:28:05,954 --> 00:28:08,123
有人闖入我朋友的家…
My friend's house got broken into, and...

337
00:28:09,708 --> 00:28:11,919
- 她媽媽失蹤了  - 哦，不
- Her mom's missing. - Oh, no.

338
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:13,795
快跑！
Run!

339
00:28:24,431 --> 00:28:26,767
- 你殺了兩個警察！  - 他們不是警察
- You killed two cops! - They weren't cops.

340
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:28,060
快走！
Let's go!

341
00:28:39,571 --> 00:28:40,822
克拉蕾
Clary.

342
00:28:41,823 --> 00:28:43,825
你不能留在這兒 他們會抓到你的
You can't stay here. They'll find you.

343
00:28:45,202 --> 00:28:47,788
盧克怎麼會說他不在乎？
How could Luke say that he didn't care?

344
00:28:47,871 --> 00:28:50,540
我從記事起就認識他了
I've known him for as long as I can remember.

345
00:28:50,624 --> 00:28:52,305
他曾每晚都為我讀故事
He used to read to me every night.

346
00:28:52,305 --> 00:28:54,419
他天天來校接我好幾年了
He's been picking me up at school for years.

347
00:28:54,503 --> 00:28:57,172
也許這記憶不真實
Look, maybe those memories aren't real.

348
00:28:57,714 --> 00:28:59,841
你不記得我說的了嗎？
Do you remember what I told you?

349
00:28:59,925 --> 00:29:01,843
誰都不能相信
You can't trust anyone.

350
00:29:03,178 --> 00:29:04,721
不，我要找回媽媽，我要回家
No, I need to find my mom. I have to go home.

351
00:29:04,805 --> 00:29:06,932
- 我肯定漏了什麼！  - 聽我說，好嗎？
- There must be something that I missed! - Listen to me, okay?

352
00:29:07,015 --> 00:29:09,017
我們會弄清的，但不是此時此地
We'll figure this out, but not here and not now.

353
00:29:09,101 --> 00:29:11,728
你得到一個安全的地方
We need to get you to a safe place.

354
00:29:11,895 --> 00:29:13,378
我是暗影獵人，克拉蕾
I'm a Shadowhunter, Clary,

355
00:29:13,378 --> 00:29:15,357
我會誓死保護你
and I will protect you with my life.

356
00:29:16,525 --> 00:29:18,819
你們在這兒，我以為你們緊跟著
There you guys are. I thought you were right behind me.

357
00:29:18,902 --> 00:29:20,404
我丟了你們
I thought I'd lost you.

358
00:29:20,487 --> 00:29:22,948
好吧，我跟著你
Okay. I'll follow you.

359
00:29:23,031 --> 00:29:25,242
你確定嗎？他剛殺了兩個警察
Are you sure about that? 'Cause he just killed two cops.

360
00:29:25,325 --> 00:29:26,535
呀，他們不是警察
Yeah, they weren't cops.

361
00:29:27,577 --> 00:29:29,621
我覺得他們就是
They looked like real cops to me.

362
00:29:29,705 --> 00:29:32,040
- 他們不是真警察  - 好吧
- They weren't real cops. - Okay.

363
00:29:33,667 --> 00:29:35,961
那他們那兒弄來的警車？
So, where did they get the car?

364
00:29:39,131 --> 00:29:41,091
他們不是真警察
They weren't real cops.

365
00:29:51,143 --> 00:29:53,020
在這我們會很安全
We'll be safe in here.

366
00:29:53,228 --> 00:29:54,896
這鬼地方是哪�？
What is this dump?

367
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,773
這不是鬼地方
This isn't a dump.

368
00:29:58,066 --> 00:29:59,943
只不過你看不見
You just can't see it.

369
00:30:33,518 --> 00:30:36,313
到底怎麼了？他們做了什麼？
What the hell is going on? What are they doing in here?

370
00:30:36,772 --> 00:30:38,273
- 這是被邪靈咬傷  - 克拉蕾
- It's a demon bite. - Clary.

371
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,275
傑斯，做點什麼！
Jace, do something!

372
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:42,743
接下來是不是你該撕掉你的襯衣
Is this the part when you start tearing off pieces of your shirt

373
00:30:42,743 --> 00:30:44,279
包紮我的傷口呢？
to bind my wounds?

374
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:46,521
如果你要我把這身衣服脫下來
If you wanted me to take my clothes off,

375
00:30:46,521 --> 00:30:47,949
只要你發話就行
you should've just asked.

376
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:58,919
只是有點發燒
It's just a fever.

377
00:31:07,219 --> 00:31:09,137
她醒了
She's waking up.

378
00:31:30,617 --> 00:31:32,614
我昏倒後你們給紋的？
I passed out, and you guys tattooed me?

379
00:31:32,614 --> 00:31:34,413
我以為這只在賭城才會發生
Thought that only happened in Vegas.

380
00:31:34,496 --> 00:31:36,164
- 這不是紋身  - 是圖符
- It's not a tattoo. - It's a rune.

381
00:31:36,248 --> 00:31:37,733
它讓你擁有一切：
They have them for everything,

382
00:31:37,733 --> 00:31:39,793
隱身術，強健之軀和自愈術
they make you invisible, strong, they heal.

383
00:31:39,876 --> 00:31:41,208
它讓你可見
They also make you visible.

384
00:31:41,208 --> 00:31:42,921
所以我突然可以看到他
That's why I could suddenly see him.

385
00:31:43,004 --> 00:31:45,090
- 即使你不吃飯…  - 不
- Even if you're hungry... - No.

386
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:50,387
事實上，這圖符是讓你可以看到我們
The fact that the rune had an effect on you explains why you can see us.

387
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:51,596
我沒弄懂
I don't get it.

388
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,418
凡人是挺不過來的
Mundanes can't survive the process.

389
00:31:53,418 --> 00:31:55,350
他們無法承受這圖符的力量，所以…
The runes are too strong for them, so...

390
00:31:55,434 --> 00:31:57,477
現在，我們很確定你有暗影獵人的血脈
Now we definitely know you have Shadowhunter blood.

391
00:31:57,561 --> 00:31:59,271
等等，那之前就不確定了？
Wait, it wasn't definite before?

392
00:31:59,354 --> 00:32:01,898
她沒死，才讓我們更確定，是這樣的
Well, it became definite when she didn't die. Yes.

393
00:32:02,524 --> 00:32:04,568
看看合不合身
Here, see if these fit.

394
00:32:04,651 --> 00:32:06,570
我們這不是天天有貴客的
It's not every day we get guests in here.

395
00:32:06,653 --> 00:32:08,447
尤其少見女客人
Especially not girls.

396
00:32:11,116 --> 00:32:12,200
是啊
Yeah.

397
00:32:19,875 --> 00:32:21,751
我們要叫警察來嗎？
Shouldn't we call the cops?

398
00:32:21,835 --> 00:32:23,712
我指的是真警察
I mean, the real ones.

399
00:32:24,045 --> 00:32:24,908
好主意
That's a great idea.

400
00:32:24,908 --> 00:32:26,882
我只是不懂我們為何沒想到過
I just don't know why we haven't thought of that

401
00:32:26,965 --> 00:32:29,092
在過去的這幾千年中
for the past thousand years.

402
00:32:30,427 --> 00:32:32,345
霍奇在等她
Hodge is ready for her.

403
00:32:33,263 --> 00:32:35,765
他想在藏書館單獨見她
He wants to see her alone in the library.

404
00:32:36,975 --> 00:32:38,268
霍奇是誰？
Who's Hodge?

405
00:32:38,727 --> 00:32:40,395
他是這�的頭
He's in charge of the Institute.

406
00:32:41,104 --> 00:32:42,314
好吧，我們走
Okay, let's go.

407
00:32:42,939 --> 00:32:45,775
無數的暗影獵人曾來此尋求庇護
Hundreds of Shadowhunters used to seek asylum here.

408
00:32:45,859 --> 00:32:47,611
但你也看到了
But, as you can see,

409
00:32:47,903 --> 00:32:50,155
現在只剩我們這幾個了
right now, we're the only ones.

410
00:32:50,238 --> 00:32:53,158
沒有聖盃，我們只能等死
Without the Mortal Cup, we're a dying breed.

411
00:32:53,658 --> 00:32:55,869
要麼你是暗影獵人的後代
Either you're born of a Shadowhunter,

412
00:32:55,952 --> 00:32:58,413
要麼你有喝過聖盃之水
or you have to drink from the Mortal Cup.

413
00:33:05,545 --> 00:33:06,922
你來自
You coming?

414
00:33:10,258 --> 00:33:12,677
遙遠的布魯克林，對吧？
Pretty far from Brooklyn, isn't it?

415
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,472
離傑斯遠點
Stay away from Jace.

416
00:33:20,769 --> 00:33:23,021
你可能覺得霍奇有點古怪
You may find Hodge a little eccentric,

417
00:33:23,104 --> 00:33:26,399
但他曾是最出色的暗影獵人之一
but he's one of the greatest Shadowhunters that's ever lived.

418
00:33:26,483 --> 00:33:28,193
這給我
Here, give me that.

419
00:34:06,815 --> 00:34:08,733
你不覺得這有點冒險
Don't you think it's a bit risky

420
00:34:08,817 --> 00:34:10,363
讓一個完全陌生的人
inviting a complete stranger

421
00:34:10,363 --> 00:34:12,070
闖進神院中心？
into the heart of the Institute?

422
00:34:12,153 --> 00:34:14,739
不，我們可以相信她
No. I think we can trust her.

423
00:34:14,823 --> 00:34:16,366
那她的凡人朋友呢？
And what about her mundane friend?

424
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:17,909
嗯，這是一時疏忽
Well, that was impulsive.

425
00:34:18,326 --> 00:34:20,245
你一時疏忽，會弄砸事
When you're impulsive, things go badly.

426
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:26,675
當心
Just be careful,

427
00:34:26,675 --> 00:34:29,671
自愈心碎的圖符是最疼的
the rune to fix a broken heart is the most painful one.

428
00:34:30,255 --> 00:34:33,049
我保證適時讓他們離開
They'll be out of here in a day, I promise.

429
00:34:39,931 --> 00:34:41,182
傑斯
Jace.

430
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,940
她曾是最出色的獵人之一
She was one of the best,

431
00:34:49,232 --> 00:34:50,525
你的母親
your mum.

432
00:34:51,192 --> 00:34:52,777
但我不明白為什麼她…
But I don't understand why...

433
00:34:52,861 --> 00:34:56,072
昨天你還只是個普通的女孩
Yesterday you were just a normal girl.

434
00:34:56,156 --> 00:34:57,741
今天彷彿感覺到
Today you feel as though

435
00:34:57,824 --> 00:35:00,702
你的世界徹底翻天覆地改變了
your whole world has been turned upside down.

436
00:35:05,206 --> 00:35:07,709
你必須知道一件事
There's only one thing you need to know.

437
00:35:08,543 --> 00:35:11,546
那是你小時候聽到的故事
The stories you were told as a little girl

438
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:13,548
怪獸和夢魘
about monsters, nightmares,

439
00:35:13,882 --> 00:35:16,926
篝火旁低訴的傳說…
legends whispered around campfires...

440
00:35:18,386 --> 00:35:19,554
他們都是真的
They're all true.

441
00:35:21,973 --> 00:35:23,725
- 邪靈？  - 對
- Demon?    - Yes.

442
00:35:28,063 --> 00:35:29,314
邪靈？
Demon?

443
00:35:29,397 --> 00:35:30,982
不，狼人不是邪靈
No. Werewolves aren't demons.

444
00:35:31,066 --> 00:35:33,485
我們和地下生物有過停戰協議
We have a truce with Downworlders.

445
00:35:33,568 --> 00:35:34,819
地下生物？
Downworlders?

446
00:35:34,903 --> 00:35:37,697
是什麼？14號街以下的人？
What is that, like people below 14th Street?

447
00:35:37,781 --> 00:35:40,116
嗯，「地下生物」包括很多
Well, "Downworlders" pretty much sums everything up,

448
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,827
吸血鬼，狼人和術士
vampires, werewolves, Warlocks.

449
00:35:42,911 --> 00:35:44,663
術士，很酷啊
Warlocks. Cool.

450
00:35:45,538 --> 00:35:47,332
你怎麼殺死一隻殭屍的？
So, how do you kill a zombie?

451
00:35:47,415 --> 00:35:48,500
我們沒殺
We don't.

452
00:35:48,583 --> 00:35:50,335
當然他們已經死了
Of course, they're already dead.

453
00:35:50,418 --> 00:35:52,212
不，他們不存在
No. They don't exist.

454
00:35:54,422 --> 00:35:57,008
那麼這就是大家所說的聖盃吧
So, that's the famous Cup everyone's talking about.

455
00:35:57,092 --> 00:35:59,219
只是個模型，不過也對
A replica. But yes.

456
00:36:01,346 --> 00:36:04,683
那你知道傑斯敏感易怒咯
You know, Jace has got a real chip on his shoulder.

457
00:36:04,766 --> 00:36:05,433
你也一樣的
You would, too,

458
00:36:05,433 --> 00:36:07,686
如果你小時候親眼看到你父親被殺
if you saw your father murdered when you were a child.

459
00:36:07,769 --> 00:36:09,521
要不是他，我們全死了
If it weren't for him, we'd be dead.

460
00:36:09,604 --> 00:36:12,857
我都說不清他救了我們多少次了
He saved our lives more times than I care to admit.

461
00:36:13,858 --> 00:36:15,026
好吧
Right.

462
00:36:20,824 --> 00:36:22,450
據傳說
The legend goes,

463
00:36:23,076 --> 00:36:26,121
十字軍曾召喚過一位天使
the Crusaders summoned an angel,

464
00:36:26,996 --> 00:36:28,623
天使拉齊爾
the Angel Raziel.

465
00:36:29,332 --> 00:36:31,751
拉齊爾將自己的鮮血倒入聖盃
Raziel poured his blood into a cup,

466
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,651
那些喝過其血的人
and those who drank from it

467
00:36:33,651 --> 00:36:35,463
變成半天使，半凡人
became half angel, half human.

468
00:36:35,797 --> 00:36:37,298
暗影獵人
Shadowhunters.

469
00:36:37,966 --> 00:36:40,927
這會遺傳給他們的子子孫孫
As did their children and their children's children.

470
00:36:41,302 --> 00:36:43,138
有強大力量的族群
Beings of immense power,

471
00:36:43,263 --> 00:36:45,598
足以恢復和平
strong enough to restore balance

472
00:36:45,682 --> 00:36:49,060
保護世界，抵禦邪靈
and protect the world in a war against evil.

473
00:36:49,144 --> 00:36:51,396
這是無贏家的鬥爭
A war that can never be won,

474
00:36:52,605 --> 00:36:54,816
但永無休止
but must always be fought.

475
00:36:56,735 --> 00:36:58,903
因為邪靈永生不息
Demons don't die easily.

476
00:37:00,321 --> 00:37:04,159
但我們卻終有一死
Whereas we, we remained all too mortal.

477
00:37:04,617 --> 00:37:06,370
你們幹嘛不用聖盃
Why didn't they just use the Cup

478
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:07,912
繁衍出更多的暗影獵人？
to create more Shadowhunters?

479
00:37:07,996 --> 00:37:09,622
瓦倫丁也這麼說過
Valentine's exact words.

480
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:12,250
克拉夫－聖盃守護者
The Clave, the keepers of the Cup,

481
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:14,252
他們害怕其力量
they were afraid of using its power.

482
00:37:14,335 --> 00:37:17,297
他們知道沒人能承受住聖盃的力量而存活
They knew that hardly anyone who drank from it survived.

483
00:37:18,173 --> 00:37:21,843
瓦倫丁·摩根斯坦召集了一群朋友
Valentine Morgenstern drew a circle of friends together,

484
00:37:22,177 --> 00:37:25,096
一群年輕妄想的暗影獵人
young, idealistic Shadowhunters,

485
00:37:27,724 --> 00:37:31,186
幫他從克拉夫手�偷到了聖盃
to help him steal the Mortal Cup from the Clave.

486
00:37:33,605 --> 00:37:36,316
但瓦倫丁並不想保護人類
But he didn't want to protect humanity.

487
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:40,945
他相信暗影獵人可以進化
He believed there had to be an evolution of Shadowhunters,

488
00:37:41,029 --> 00:37:42,697
變得更具力量
something more powerful.

489
00:37:42,781 --> 00:37:45,533
他開始試著使用聖盃
He began experimenting, using the Mortal Cup.

490
00:37:46,659 --> 00:37:48,953
並學會了召喚邪靈
He learned how to summon demons.

491
00:37:51,122 --> 00:37:53,396
他甚至給自己注射過邪靈的鮮血
He even injected himself with demon blood

492
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:54,751
以此來控制他們
so he could control them.

493
00:37:56,044 --> 00:37:57,754
他想統治一切
He wanted to rule.

494
00:37:59,714 --> 00:38:01,758
為了阻止他，你媽媽
Your mother, to prevent that,

495
00:38:01,841 --> 00:38:04,135
偷走了聖盃
stole the Cup from him,

496
00:38:04,219 --> 00:38:05,887
而後消失不見
and vanished into thin air.

497
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:08,932
但要是只有她知道聖盃在哪�，那麼…
But if she's the only one that knows where the Cup is, then...

498
00:38:09,057 --> 00:38:10,725
也許不只她
Maybe she isn't.

499
00:38:10,809 --> 00:38:12,977
她可能告訴某人了
Maybe she told someone else.

500
00:38:14,479 --> 00:38:16,731
一個沒有人猜到她知道的人
Someone who doesn't know she knows.

501
00:38:21,444 --> 00:38:23,404
賽任兄弟們在等她
The Silent Brothers are ready for her.

502
00:38:27,242 --> 00:38:28,660
為什麼霍奇不一塊來？
Why didn't Hodge come with us?

503
00:38:28,743 --> 00:38:30,662
他好多年沒離開神院了
He hasn't left the Institute in years.

504
00:38:30,745 --> 00:38:32,247
有人說是詛咒
Some say it's a spell.

505
00:38:32,997 --> 00:38:34,499
他有恐曠癥吧
He's agoraphobic.

506
00:38:40,547 --> 00:38:41,714
是他嗎？
Is that him?

507
00:38:41,798 --> 00:38:43,758
不，那是哈羅德，掃地工
No, that's Harold, the groundskeeper.

508
00:38:44,884 --> 00:38:46,135
是他
That's him.

509
00:38:59,107 --> 00:39:02,402
你想好要經歷這些了嗎？
Are you sure you want to go through with this?

510
00:39:05,113 --> 00:39:07,615
我們會幫你解開回憶
We will help you to remember.

511
00:39:54,996 --> 00:39:56,372
你會吵醒亡靈的
You'll wake the dead.

512
00:40:00,376 --> 00:40:03,796
難以置信，這地方就在城市外
I can't believe this place is just outside the city.

513
00:40:18,978 --> 00:40:21,189
歡迎來到　骸骨之城
Welcome to the City of Bones.

514
00:40:27,987 --> 00:40:30,615
這是賽任兄弟汲取力量的源泉
This is where the Silent Brothers draw their power,

515
00:40:30,698 --> 00:40:33,534
暗影獵人的骸骨和骨灰
from the bones and ashes of Shadowhunters.

516
00:40:34,327 --> 00:40:36,245
他們都埋在這�？
All of them are buried here?

517
00:40:36,329 --> 00:40:38,414
對，有一天
Yes. One day,

518
00:40:39,415 --> 00:40:41,209
我會在這�
that's gonna be me.

519
00:40:50,885 --> 00:40:52,345
我只能跟到這兒了
This is as far as I go.

520
00:40:52,428 --> 00:40:53,972
你不會有事的
You'll be fine.

521
00:40:56,224 --> 00:40:58,226
你之前試過嗎？
So you've done this before?

522
00:40:59,852 --> 00:41:01,187
沒
No.

523
00:41:13,783 --> 00:41:16,411
你必須傾聽自己的內心
You must listen with your mind.

524
00:42:10,465 --> 00:42:11,716
媽？
Mom?

525
00:42:13,551 --> 00:42:14,635
媽？
Mom?

526
00:42:21,809 --> 00:42:23,186
去，去
Go. Go.

527
00:42:29,734 --> 00:42:31,319
克拉蕾，這是盧克
Clary, this is Luke,

528
00:42:31,402 --> 00:42:33,196
我最好的朋友
my dearest friend.

529
00:42:33,446 --> 00:42:35,156
你可以信任他
You can trust him.

530
00:42:35,281 --> 00:42:36,783
你好，克拉蕾
Hi, Clary.

531
00:42:39,619 --> 00:42:40,995
別說
Don't tell.

532
00:42:52,131 --> 00:42:54,217
別碰那老東西
Don't touch that old thing.

533
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:58,012
只是個舊杯子，克拉蕾
It's just an old cup, Clary.

534
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,396
克拉蕾！克拉蕾，你還好嗎？
Clary! Clary, are you okay?

535
00:43:08,439 --> 00:43:09,649
克拉蕾？
Clary?

536
00:43:15,321 --> 00:43:18,116
封印比預想的要強
Your block is stronger than I anticipated.

537
00:43:18,199 --> 00:43:20,868
解鈴還須繫鈴人了
It can only be undone by the one who put it there.

538
00:43:21,202 --> 00:43:22,995
我不清楚繫鈴人是誰
I have no idea who put it there.

539
00:43:23,079 --> 00:43:24,789
你寫出來了
You wrote it.

540
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:34,465
你記得是相反的印象
Your mind remembers the inverted image.

541
00:43:34,549 --> 00:43:36,843
要換個角度看
Just have to look at it differently.

542
00:43:38,302 --> 00:43:40,054
「貝恩」
"B-A-N-E."

543
00:43:41,764 --> 00:43:43,432
- 貝恩  - 是誰？
- Bane.    - Who?

544
00:43:43,516 --> 00:43:46,310
馬格努斯·貝恩，我記得他是個術士
Magnus Bane. He's a warlock. I should have known.

545
00:43:46,394 --> 00:43:48,396
好，那找他去
Well, let's go talk to him then.

546
00:43:48,479 --> 00:43:49,981
不能這樣去
Not like that.

547
00:43:50,731 --> 00:43:53,276
你需要伊莎貝爾的協助
We're gonna need some help from Isabelle.

548
00:43:53,734 --> 00:43:55,153
這是上衣
This is a top.

549
00:43:55,236 --> 00:43:56,737
是連衣裙
It's a dress.

550
00:43:58,614 --> 00:44:00,491
我穿不了
I can't pull this off.

551
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:02,326
就差雙合適的鞋子…
Well, actually, with the right shoes...

552
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:03,870
不，我是說…
No, I mean...

553
00:44:03,953 --> 00:44:06,664
這衣服太緊，像包了一層皮一樣
This dress is so tight, it's like a second skin.

554
00:44:08,291 --> 00:44:10,501
你難道沒有別的了嗎？
Don't you have anything else?

555
00:44:11,127 --> 00:44:13,171
要是你穿得像凡人那樣去的話
If you go out looking like your mundane self,

556
00:44:13,254 --> 00:44:15,548
我們接近不了馬格努斯·貝恩
we won't get within a hundred feet of Magnus Bane.

557
00:44:15,631 --> 00:44:17,800
他是布魯克林的高級術士
He's the High Warlock of Brooklyn.

558
00:44:17,884 --> 00:44:19,969
別抱怨了，過來
Now, stop complaining, come over here.

559
00:44:23,264 --> 00:44:24,432
拿著
Hold this.

560
00:44:27,518 --> 00:44:29,896
亞力克好像很討厭我
That guy Alec doesn't like me very much.

561
00:44:29,979 --> 00:44:32,190
亞力克是我的兄弟
That guy Alec is my brother.

562
00:44:34,692 --> 00:44:37,445
傑斯知道亞力克對他的感覺嗎？
Does Jace know how Alec feels about him?

563
00:44:39,405 --> 00:44:41,240
很明顯嗎？
Is it that obvious?

564
00:44:41,324 --> 00:44:43,534
這真沒什麼大不了的
It's really not that big of a deal.

565
00:44:43,618 --> 00:44:45,494
對我也一樣
It isn't to me either.

566
00:44:46,245 --> 00:44:47,714
但對克拉夫不同
But it is to the Clave.

567
00:44:47,714 --> 00:44:49,123
規則不是我定的
I don't make the rules.

568
00:44:51,959 --> 00:44:54,128
看，現在多漂亮
See? You look pretty.

569
00:44:55,588 --> 00:44:57,000
幹嘛要穿得這麼妖艷
How is being dressed like a hooker

570
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,049
會幫我找到媽媽？
gonna help me find my mom?

571
00:44:58,132 --> 00:45:00,509
放鬆點，那些只是我的衣服而已
Easy now, those are my clothes.

572
00:45:01,302 --> 00:45:02,720
亞力克，她看上去漂亮吧？
Doesn't she look great, Alec?

573
00:45:02,803 --> 00:45:03,951
她看上去就像
She looks like someone

574
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:06,349
留電話號碼在浴室牆上的人
whose phone number should be on a bathroom wall.

575
00:45:11,604 --> 00:45:13,481
我覺得你很漂亮
I think you look great.

576
00:45:28,246 --> 00:45:30,331
等等，我來過這�
Wait, I've been here.

577
00:46:00,778 --> 00:46:02,238
- 等等  - 怎麼了？
- Wait.     - What?

578
00:46:10,579 --> 00:46:12,039
這樣更好點？
Is that better?

579
00:46:12,123 --> 00:46:13,457
更好了
It's better.

580
00:46:27,972 --> 00:46:29,515
嘿，嘿，嘿
Well, well, well.

581
00:46:29,765 --> 00:46:30,933
瞧瞧這兒
Look-a here.

582
00:46:31,058 --> 00:46:33,728
什麼風把人神的孩子們吹到這兒
I don't remember inviting any children of the Nephilim.

583
00:46:33,811 --> 00:46:36,605
馬格努斯·貝恩，我們要談談
Magnus Bane. We need to talk.

584
00:46:37,064 --> 00:46:38,482
我不喜歡你們
You know I don't like you guys.

585
00:46:38,566 --> 00:46:39,908
但我還讓你們待在這兒
But I'll let you stay,

586
00:46:39,908 --> 00:46:41,777
只是因為這火辣寶貝
but only because of the hot one.

587
00:46:41,861 --> 00:46:43,446
- 謝謝  - 謝謝
- Thanks. - Thank you.

588
00:46:43,529 --> 00:46:44,613
什麼？
What?

589
00:46:45,823 --> 00:46:47,241
我說的是他
I meant him.

590
00:46:47,491 --> 00:46:49,160
藍眼睛的那位
The one with the blue eyes.

591
00:46:52,038 --> 00:46:53,998
還有克拉蕾
And because of Clary.

592
00:46:54,081 --> 00:46:56,208
等等，你怎麼知道她名字？
Wait. How do you know her name?

593
00:46:56,292 --> 00:46:57,752
跟我來
Come with me.

594
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:03,549
- 你媽媽呢？  - 她失蹤了
- Where's your mother? - She's missing.

595
00:47:04,925 --> 00:47:06,552
原來如此
That explains it.

596
00:47:08,179 --> 00:47:09,940
她每年都帶你來這兒
Every year, she brought you here.

597
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:11,599
從來沒有漏過一次
She never missed an appointment.

598
00:47:13,184 --> 00:47:16,228
我在你身上下的咒語是最成功的
Not every spell turns out as perfect as the one I did on you.

599
00:47:19,106 --> 00:47:21,525
一旦你開始畫天使圖符
As soon as you started drawing the angelic rune,

600
00:47:21,609 --> 00:47:24,028
說明你的記憶又回來了
it was a sign your memory was surfacing.

601
00:47:24,111 --> 00:47:25,696
我將此咒深藏在你記憶中
I had built that into your mind

602
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:28,240
她就能適時帶你回來封印
so that she knew when to bring you back.

603
00:47:28,532 --> 00:47:30,493
暗影世界�的一切，你都會忘記
What you saw from the shadow world,

604
00:47:30,576 --> 00:47:32,745
即使你看過
you would forget, even as you saw it.

605
00:47:33,496 --> 00:47:34,622
可你越長大
But as you grew older,

606
00:47:34,622 --> 00:47:36,582
你需要封印的次數也越來越多
you needed my treatment more frequently.

607
00:47:37,041 --> 00:47:39,043
她知道有一天非得告訴你
She knew she had to tell you one day,

608
00:47:39,126 --> 00:47:40,294
但想等你準備好後
but until you were ready,

609
00:47:40,628 --> 00:47:42,704
她想封印回憶
she wanted to keep the block on your mind.

610
00:47:42,704 --> 00:47:44,298
這就是她想做的
It was exactly how she wanted it.

611
00:47:51,597 --> 00:47:53,557
我們要在這兒待多久？
How long do you think we're gonna be here?

612
00:47:53,641 --> 00:47:54,850
西蒙，放鬆點，好嗎？
Relax, Simon, okay?

613
00:48:00,981 --> 00:48:02,733
別喝！
Don't drink that!

614
00:48:04,276 --> 00:48:06,570
西蒙！西蒙！
Simon! Simon!

615
00:48:09,156 --> 00:48:10,658
時間會消磨封印
It'll wear off over time.

616
00:48:10,741 --> 00:48:13,244
現在已經磨去了，要麼你不會來這兒
It's already wearing off, or you wouldn't be here.

617
00:48:13,327 --> 00:48:14,829
我還是記不起來
I need to remember.

618
00:48:14,912 --> 00:48:16,326
我媽沒有多少時間了
My mom doesn't have time.

619
00:48:16,326 --> 00:48:18,666
求你了，你肯定能做點什麼
Please, there must be something you can do.

620
00:48:25,548 --> 00:48:29,009
你就是買我母親畫的人
You're the one who's been buying all my mom's paintings.

621
00:48:30,886 --> 00:48:33,013
你為什麼每幅都買？
Why did you buy all of them?

622
00:48:33,097 --> 00:48:34,473
我清楚她需要錢
I knew she needed the money.

623
00:48:34,557 --> 00:48:35,975
你甚至有我爸爸的畫像
You even have a portrait of my dad.

624
00:48:38,436 --> 00:48:40,020
那不是你爸
That's not your dad.

625
00:48:40,104 --> 00:48:41,856
他只是戰死在伊朗的一名士兵
He's a soldier who died in Iraq.

626
00:48:41,939 --> 00:48:43,858
喬絲琳從沒見過他
Jocelyn never even met the guy.

627
00:48:43,941 --> 00:48:45,609
有人請她畫的
She was asked to paint his portrait,

628
00:48:45,609 --> 00:48:47,278
但這對一位寡婦來說太痛苦了
but it was too painful for the widow.

629
00:48:47,361 --> 00:48:48,973
她保留著畫，所以…
She kept the picture so...

630
00:48:48,973 --> 00:48:50,865
她就能假裝他是我爸爸
She could pretend he was my dad.

631
00:48:52,825 --> 00:48:54,785
她做的一切都是為了你
Everything she did, she did for you.

632
00:48:54,869 --> 00:48:56,454
你媽媽生命中的一切：
Your mother's whole existence,

633
00:48:56,537 --> 00:48:58,497
逃跑，躲藏，謊言
the running, the hiding, the lies,

634
00:48:58,581 --> 00:49:00,458
都是為了你的安全
were to keep you safe.

635
00:49:01,125 --> 00:49:03,627
她有跟我說過什麼真話嗎？
Was anything she ever told me true?

636
00:49:05,754 --> 00:49:08,716
你頭腦�藏著一幅寶藏圖，克拉蕾
There's a treasure map inside your head, Clary.

637
00:49:08,799 --> 00:49:11,469
找到聖盃，它能帶你找到你媽媽
Find the Cup, and it will lead you to your mother.

638
00:49:11,552 --> 00:49:13,095
他們把西蒙帶走了
They've taken Simon.

639
00:49:13,179 --> 00:49:14,847
- 誰？  - 吸血鬼
- Who?   - Vampires.

640
00:49:17,057 --> 00:49:18,559
別忘了
Just remember,

641
00:49:18,642 --> 00:49:21,770
你媽媽躲避的正是暗影獵人
it was Shadowhunters your mother was running from.

642
00:49:23,189 --> 00:49:24,982
我們去找西蒙
Let's go find Simon.

643
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:31,530
我們不能闖進吸血鬼的老巢，我們從沒試過
We can't break into a vampire's lair, we never learned.

644
00:49:31,614 --> 00:49:34,200
- 又開始了你  - 傑斯，這你知道的
- Don't start again. - Jace, you know the rules.

645
00:49:34,283 --> 00:49:35,443
夥計，我們來這幹嘛？
Guys, what are we doing here?

646
00:49:35,443 --> 00:49:36,952
我們不是要找西蒙嗎？
I thought we were trying to find Simon.

647
00:49:37,036 --> 00:49:39,455
我們知道他在哪，只是需要先拿些東西
We know where he is. We just need to pick up a few things.

648
00:49:41,874 --> 00:49:44,043
這是什麼？你們和教堂有某種約定？
What is this, some kind of deal you have with the church?

649
00:49:45,628 --> 00:49:47,358
邪靈在世界各地都有
Demons exist all across the world

650
00:49:47,358 --> 00:49:49,089
而且外形各異
in their varying, different forms.

651
00:49:49,423 --> 00:49:52,176
暗影獵人從不單信某個宗教
Shadowhunters cling to no particular religion,

652
00:49:52,259 --> 00:49:54,845
因此，所有宗教都能協助我們作戰
and in turn all religions assist us in our battle.

653
00:49:54,929 --> 00:49:57,932
我們自如穿梭在猶太教堂
We could have as easily gone to a Jewish synagogue

654
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:59,517
或神道教塔…
or a Shinto temple or...

655
00:50:02,102 --> 00:50:03,479
在這
Here it is.

656
00:50:10,611 --> 00:50:13,113
在每個教堂的祭壇底下…
Beneath every altar in every church...

657
00:50:14,907 --> 00:50:16,659
都能找到這個
you'll find this.

658
00:50:29,296 --> 00:50:30,965
那你們信仰什麼？
So, what do you believe in?

659
00:50:31,048 --> 00:50:32,716
我信仰自己
I believe in myself.

660
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,176
我知道殺死邪靈是我的職責
I know my job is to kill demons.

661
00:50:34,176 --> 00:50:35,886
其它我一概不信
I don't have to believe in anything else.

662
00:50:35,970 --> 00:50:37,221
那天使拉齊爾呢？
What about the Angel Raziel?

663
00:50:37,221 --> 00:50:38,472
那是美麗的傳說
Yeah, makes for a nice story.

664
00:50:38,556 --> 00:50:40,307
- 但霍奇說…  - 是啊，霍奇
- But Hodge thinks... - Yeah, Hodge.

665
00:50:40,599 --> 00:50:42,059
他還有很多沒說
He needs to get out more.

666
00:50:42,643 --> 00:50:44,812
- 我原以為…  - 聽著，我一直在獵殺邪靈
- I thought... - Listen, I've been hunting demons

667
00:50:44,895 --> 00:50:46,188
已經花掉了我三分之一的生命
for over a third of my life,

668
00:50:46,272 --> 00:50:48,899
到目前為止，從未見過天使
and in all that time, I've never seen an angel.

669
00:50:49,149 --> 00:50:50,276
這兒
Here.

670
00:50:51,652 --> 00:50:53,320
這，你拿這個
Here, you take this one.

671
00:50:54,989 --> 00:50:56,365
我不會…
I don't...

672
00:50:56,824 --> 00:50:58,158
這，我教你
Here, let me show you.

673
00:50:58,242 --> 00:51:01,036
這是一把殺吸血鬼的槍，必須瞄準他們的心臟
It's a vampire gun. Must pierce the heart.

674
00:51:01,328 --> 00:51:03,581
推上來，對著胸膛
Push it up against the chest.

675
00:51:03,914 --> 00:51:04,999
開火
Fire.

676
00:51:08,002 --> 00:51:10,170
再裝槍 重發
Recharge. Then you're good to go again.

677
00:51:18,429 --> 00:51:19,597
死人客棧？
Hotel of Death?

678
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,640
他們也有幽默感
You can't say they don't have a sense of humor.

679
00:51:21,724 --> 00:51:22,850
快點
Come on.

680
00:51:27,062 --> 00:51:29,106
- 她怎麼辦？  - 她很勇敢
- What is it about her? - She's brave.

681
00:51:29,189 --> 00:51:31,066
我們暗影獵人都勇敢
We're Shadowhunters, we're all brave.

682
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:32,901
她不像我們那樣撫養長大，她不同
She wasn't raised like us, she's different.

683
00:51:33,402 --> 00:51:35,529
她會連累我們被殺
She's gonna get us all killed.

684
00:52:36,757 --> 00:52:38,592
是西蒙的襯衫
Simon's shirt.

685
00:53:10,958 --> 00:53:12,167
他在上面
He's up here.

686
00:53:17,965 --> 00:53:19,299
西蒙
Simon.

687
00:53:29,768 --> 00:53:32,354
- 我的天，我的天，西蒙  - 克拉蕾
- Oh, my God, oh, my God, Simon. - Clary.

688
00:53:38,318 --> 00:53:40,320
不，我能觸到他了！
No, I can feel him!

689
00:53:41,613 --> 00:53:44,199
搭把手 快點，快點
Give me a hand. Come on, come on.

690
00:53:45,701 --> 00:53:47,161
這該死的靴子！
These damn boots!

691
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:50,914
這兒
Here.

692
00:53:50,998 --> 00:53:52,124
好
Here you go.

693
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,461
- 快點  - 夥計，穩住
- Come on. - Guys, steady.

694
00:54:00,215 --> 00:54:01,425
慢點
Slowly.

695
00:54:12,478 --> 00:54:13,562
他還活著！
He's alive!

696
00:54:13,771 --> 00:54:14,813
小心
Careful.

697
00:54:17,232 --> 00:54:20,110
快走，他們要的不是我
Go on. Get out. They don't want me.

698
00:54:20,194 --> 00:54:22,196
要的是你，他們要的是聖盃
They want you, they want the Cup.

699
00:54:38,086 --> 00:54:39,588
- 快點，走  - 天啊
- Come on. Let's go. - Oh, God.

700
00:54:39,922 --> 00:54:41,256
快！
Let's go!

701
00:54:44,301 --> 00:54:45,636
不，這兒
No, here.

702
00:54:56,104 --> 00:54:57,648
- 這兒！  - 走！
- In here! - Go!

703
00:55:14,122 --> 00:55:15,374
傑斯
Jace.

704
00:55:56,540 --> 00:55:57,708
你身後！
Behind you!

705
00:56:22,524 --> 00:56:24,192
快點！快點！
Come on! Come on!

706
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:58,185
克拉蕾！
Clary!

707
00:57:23,585 --> 00:57:25,295
他們人數太多
There's too many of them.

708
00:57:25,379 --> 00:57:27,130
抱點信念
Have a little faith.

709
00:57:56,410 --> 00:57:57,619
跑！
Run!

710
00:58:11,258 --> 00:58:13,343
傑斯，給我把短刀
Jace, I need a knife.

711
00:58:16,013 --> 00:58:17,931
- 日出  - 快走
- The sun. - Let's go.

712
00:58:28,525 --> 00:58:29,776
幫西蒙
You help Simon.

713
00:58:43,874 --> 00:58:44,875
克拉蕾！
Clary!

714
00:58:48,295 --> 00:58:49,546
抓住！
Hold on!

715
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:51,798
克拉蕾！
Clary!

716
00:59:03,185 --> 00:59:04,519
謝謝
Thank you.

717
00:59:07,773 --> 00:59:09,399
你救了西蒙
For saving Simon.

718
00:59:23,163 --> 00:59:25,999
- 還好嗎？  - 我沒事，我沒事
- Are you okay? - I'm okay, I'm okay.

719
00:59:45,352 --> 00:59:46,436
克拉蕾
Clary.

720
00:59:47,979 --> 00:59:49,231
能和你談談嗎？
Can I talk to you?

721
00:59:49,439 --> 00:59:52,025
行，我正要去看西蒙
Yeah, I was just gonna go see Simon.

722
00:59:54,361 --> 00:59:56,738
- 我希望你離開這兒  - 什麼？
- I want you to leave here. - What?

723
00:59:56,822 --> 00:59:58,240
你差點讓我們送死
You almost got us killed.

724
00:59:59,199 --> 01:00:00,909
對不起，我們別無選擇
I'm sorry, we didn't have a choice.

725
01:00:00,992 --> 01:00:02,536
要救西蒙，而傑斯…
I mean, we had to save Simon, and Jace...

726
01:00:02,619 --> 01:00:04,704
傑斯應該拯救世界
Jace thinks he needs to save the world.

727
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:08,250
但你沒鼓勵他這麼做
But you don't need to encourage him to do it.

728
01:00:08,333 --> 01:00:09,300
這就是你們要做的
But that's what you guys do.

729
01:00:09,384 --> 01:00:13,171
對，我們　要做的
Yes, us. What we do.

730
01:00:13,588 --> 01:00:15,590
我們是團隊，你是累贅
We're a team, you're deadweight.

731
01:00:16,550 --> 01:00:18,802
- 凡人  - 我不是凡人
- A mundane. - I'm not a mundane.

732
01:00:19,928 --> 01:00:22,035
你要是表現得有半點勇敢
And if you were half as brave as you pretend to be,

733
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:22,806
就得承認…
you'd admit that...

734
01:00:22,889 --> 01:00:24,224
什麼？
What?

735
01:00:24,683 --> 01:00:26,386
你承認你愛上了傑斯
You'd admit that you're in love with Jace,

736
01:00:26,386 --> 01:00:27,853
這才是千真萬確的
and that's what this is really about.

737
01:00:29,563 --> 01:00:32,566
你敢再這樣說一下…
If you ever say anything like that again...

738
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:35,527
我定殺死你
I'll kill you.

739
01:01:01,845 --> 01:01:04,306
- 我暈了多久？  - 一整天
- How long was I out? - All day.

740
01:01:04,389 --> 01:01:05,891
你的眼鏡
Found your glasses.

741
01:01:05,974 --> 01:01:07,934
- 有一邊鏡片裂了  - 嗯
- One of the lenses cracked. - Yeah.

742
01:01:16,985 --> 01:01:18,695
好神奇
How weird.

743
01:01:21,531 --> 01:01:23,408
我似乎不需要它了
I don't seem to need them anymore.

744
01:01:26,453 --> 01:01:29,039
那你在畫什麼？
So, what are you drawing?

745
01:01:30,373 --> 01:01:31,708
沒什麼
Nothing.

746
01:01:41,843 --> 01:01:43,887
- 你還好嗎？  - 還好
- You okay?     - Yeah.

747
01:01:43,970 --> 01:01:45,305
這太瘋狂了
It was crazy.

748
01:01:49,309 --> 01:01:51,311
對不起之前我不相信你
I'm sorry I didn't believe you before.

749
01:01:51,394 --> 01:01:52,896
現在我信了
Now I get it.

750
01:01:54,814 --> 01:01:56,149
還有…
And...

751
01:01:57,484 --> 01:01:59,903
當時我昏倒了
And I must have passed out,

752
01:02:00,779 --> 01:02:02,155
接著你就出現
and then you showed up.

753
01:02:03,073 --> 01:02:04,616
聽著
Listen,

754
01:02:04,699 --> 01:02:08,203
我知道我總是那個要被依賴的人
I know I've always been the one who needed you

755
01:02:08,286 --> 01:02:09,621
比起你依賴我來
more than you needed me.

756
01:02:09,704 --> 01:02:11,248
- 不是真的  - 是真的
- That's not true. - Yes, it is,

757
01:02:11,331 --> 01:02:12,832
但我不在乎
but I never cared.

758
01:02:20,048 --> 01:02:23,176
我只有媽媽，盧克和你了
I've only ever had my mom, Luke and you.

759
01:02:23,927 --> 01:02:26,930
別亂想你對我來說不重要
Don't ever imagine that you weren't important to me.

760
01:02:28,014 --> 01:02:29,599
- 好吧  - 好吧
- Okay.   - Okay.

761
01:03:13,101 --> 01:03:15,103
你跟鋼琴有仇嗎？
What did that piano ever do to you?

762
01:03:15,186 --> 01:03:17,564
好像失去唯一真愛一樣
You play it like you've lost your only love.

763
01:03:17,939 --> 01:03:20,317
不幸的是我唯一真愛就是自己
Unfortunately, my one true love remains myself.

764
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:22,152
至少你不用愁遭拒絕
Well, at least you don't have to worry about rejection.

765
01:03:22,235 --> 01:03:23,091
那也不一定
Not necessarily.

766
01:03:23,091 --> 01:03:26,114
我有時會自我分裂，尋求刺激
I turn myself down occasionally just to keep it interesting.

767
01:03:26,406 --> 01:03:28,158
你彈得很有熱情
You do play that with a lot of passion.

768
01:03:28,241 --> 01:03:29,419
這才有問題
Well, that's the problem.

769
01:03:29,419 --> 01:03:30,869
我不該投入太多感情
I play it with too much emotion.

770
01:03:30,952 --> 01:03:34,196
本應該只是簡單地音符重現
It's supposed to be played with a simple representation of notes,

771
01:03:34,196 --> 01:03:35,081
而不是詮釋
no interpretation.

772
01:03:38,710 --> 01:03:41,254
音樂就該有感情
Music is supposed to have emotion.

773
01:03:43,923 --> 01:03:47,344
邪靈對交錯的音調才有反應
Demons react to certain frequencies when two tones cross.

774
01:03:48,428 --> 01:03:49,637
才能使他們癲狂
Drives them crazy.

775
01:03:52,932 --> 01:03:55,810
看，巴赫發現這點並構建了一個體系
See, Bach discovered this and put it into a system using

776
01:03:55,894 --> 01:03:58,688
用數字序列融合音調
a mathematical progression of tonal combinations

777
01:03:58,772 --> 01:04:00,607
可以顯現邪靈
that allows us to expose demons.

778
01:04:05,362 --> 01:04:07,364
那巴赫也是個暗影獵人咯？
So Bach was a Shadowhunter?

779
01:04:07,447 --> 01:04:09,491
- 是的  - 這麼說…
- Yes.        - So...

780
01:04:10,158 --> 01:04:14,704
巴赫對於邪靈們就像大蒜對於吸血鬼
Bach is to demons what garlic is to vampires.

781
01:04:15,789 --> 01:04:17,123
也對吧
Kind of.

782
01:04:17,207 --> 01:04:19,209
我是說：大蒜會被用盡
I mean, you can run out of garlic.

783
01:04:19,292 --> 01:04:21,127
但音樂卻無止境
You can't really run out of music.

784
01:04:24,798 --> 01:04:27,133
那�放著你的玩意嗎？
Is that where you keep all your toys?

785
01:04:28,968 --> 01:04:30,470
有趣得多
It's way more fun.

786
01:04:30,845 --> 01:04:32,097
來吧
Come on.

787
01:04:32,180 --> 01:04:33,848
這是穿梭門
It's a portal.

788
01:04:33,932 --> 01:04:36,184
像百慕大一樣的自然現象
Like the Bermuda Triangle, it's a natural phenomenon.

789
01:04:36,267 --> 01:04:38,144
神院圍繞它而建
The Institute was built around it.

790
01:04:38,561 --> 01:04:41,815
據說神院是紐約最早的建築
Some say that the Institute was the first building in New York.

791
01:04:43,233 --> 01:04:44,275
所以它…
So it's...

792
01:04:44,359 --> 01:04:46,694
空間不都只是直線型的
Dimensions aren't all just straight lines.

793
01:04:46,778 --> 01:04:48,405
也會有彎曲
There's bends,

794
01:04:48,488 --> 01:04:50,073
折疊，凹角
folds and nooks.

795
01:04:50,657 --> 01:04:53,368
有點難以解釋，不過
It's a little bit difficult to explain, but

796
01:04:53,618 --> 01:04:57,163
穿梭門能帶你到任何你想去的地方
the Portal can take you wherever you want to go in this dimension.

797
01:04:59,499 --> 01:05:01,501
一旦穿過表面
So, as soon as you break that surface,

798
01:05:01,584 --> 01:05:04,003
你就會被送到你心底最深處
you're transported to wherever your deepest thoughts lie.

799
01:05:04,087 --> 01:05:05,130
那意味著…
So that means...

800
01:05:05,213 --> 01:05:06,923
- 我媽媽…  - 等下
- My mom... - Wait.

801
01:05:07,674 --> 01:05:10,427
我們訓練一生才懂得使用它
We spend our entire lives training how to use it,

802
01:05:10,510 --> 01:05:13,012
進入前要先想像一下所去之處
visualizing where it will take us before we step into it,

803
01:05:13,096 --> 01:05:15,432
那必須要非常集中精力
and that takes incredible focus.

804
01:05:18,852 --> 01:05:21,604
如果沒有經過正確訓練而進入的話
If you were to step into it without the proper training,

805
01:05:21,688 --> 01:05:23,466
你將永無安定
you could end up in limbo,

806
01:05:23,466 --> 01:05:25,442
永生困在記憶之中
lost in your own mind forever.

807
01:05:28,570 --> 01:05:29,737
這兒
Here.

808
01:05:29,821 --> 01:05:31,614
我做給你看
Let me show you.

809
01:05:31,698 --> 01:05:32,991
快點
Come on.

810
01:05:35,869 --> 01:05:37,036
別偷看
No peeking.

811
01:06:14,199 --> 01:06:15,575
很酷吧，對吧？
Pretty cool, isn't it?

812
01:06:16,618 --> 01:06:18,077
現在…
Now...

813
01:06:18,912 --> 01:06:21,289
你和我…
You and I...

814
01:06:21,831 --> 01:06:23,458
要慶祝你的生日
Have a birthday to celebrate.

815
01:06:23,541 --> 01:06:24,876
你怎麼知道？
How did you know?

816
01:06:24,959 --> 01:06:27,670
我之前找你，就查到過
Research. When I was trying to find you.

817
01:06:32,217 --> 01:06:34,135
不會有人來這兒
No one comes up here anymore.

818
01:06:34,219 --> 01:06:35,929
這�屬於我們
We have the place to ourselves.

819
01:06:36,679 --> 01:06:38,890
美得窒息了
This is breathtaking.

820
01:07:00,954 --> 01:07:02,330
抱歉，沒有蛋糕
Sorry there's no cake.

821
01:07:02,413 --> 01:07:04,666
我原本就沒期望
Well, I was expecting nothing,

822
01:07:04,749 --> 01:07:06,417
這已很棒了
so this is great.

823
01:07:07,210 --> 01:07:10,004
不過，每個人都該在生日那天得到些什麼
Well, everyone should get something for their birthday.

824
01:07:14,467 --> 01:07:16,177
你生日得到什麼？
What did you get?

825
01:07:16,261 --> 01:07:18,263
大多數是武器
Weapons mostly.

826
01:07:19,806 --> 01:07:21,391
希望沒讓你吃驚
I'm sure that doesn't surprise you.

827
01:07:21,474 --> 01:07:23,309
現在沒有什麼會讓我吃驚
At this point, nothing really does.

828
01:07:26,229 --> 01:07:28,731
當我九歲時…
When I was nine...

829
01:07:30,066 --> 01:07:31,818
我父親送了我一隻隼
My father gave me a falcon.

830
01:07:32,110 --> 01:07:33,778
他要我讓它聽話
He told me to make it obedient.

831
01:07:33,861 --> 01:07:35,989
我本該弄瞎那隻鳥
I was supposed to keep the bird blind,

832
01:07:36,072 --> 01:07:38,157
但我做不到
but I couldn't bring myself to do it.

833
01:07:39,033 --> 01:07:41,247
相反的是，我撫摸它的翅膀
Instead, I touched and stroked its wings

834
01:07:41,247 --> 01:07:42,328
直到它信任我
until it trusted me.

835
01:07:42,620 --> 01:07:44,581
我以為完美地馴服了它
I tamed it to perfection.

836
01:07:45,665 --> 01:07:47,263
我把它帶給父親
I took it to my father,

837
01:07:47,263 --> 01:07:50,128
希望父親為我所做的感到驕傲
expecting him to be proud of what I'd done.

838
01:07:50,503 --> 01:07:52,255
他說：
He said,

839
01:07:52,505 --> 01:07:54,591
「我是要你讓他聽話」
"I told you to make it obedient.

840
01:07:55,675 --> 01:07:57,552
「不是要你教它愛你」
"Instead, you taught it to love you.

841
01:07:57,927 --> 01:07:59,804
「你沒有馴服它，你毀了它」
"You didn't tame it, you broke it."

842
01:08:00,930 --> 01:08:03,474
他帶走鳥，並割了它的脖子
Then he took the bird and he broke its neck.

843
01:08:05,184 --> 01:08:07,437
我當時哭了整整一夜，此後再沒哭過
I cried all night and I never cried again.

844
01:08:07,937 --> 01:08:09,772
你原諒他嗎？
Did you ever forgive him?

845
01:08:11,316 --> 01:08:13,192
他這麼做是要我強大
He did it to make me stronger.

846
01:08:18,740 --> 01:08:20,241
那是你名字維蘭德的意義嗎？
Does that stand for Wayland?

847
01:08:26,956 --> 01:08:28,333
午夜
Midnight.

848
01:08:28,875 --> 01:08:30,293
瞧瞧這些
Watch this.

849
01:08:48,895 --> 01:08:50,938
一個女孩說要一顆大寶石
When a girl says she wants a big rock,

850
01:08:51,022 --> 01:08:53,274
但她並非就是這個意思
she doesn't literally mean a big rock.

851
01:08:53,358 --> 01:08:56,110
每個暗影獵人都有屬於自己的魔石
Every Shadowhunter should have their own witchlight.

852
01:09:05,161 --> 01:09:06,663
有人在
We have company.

853
01:09:07,914 --> 01:09:09,415
那只是霍奇的鳥
That's Hodge's bird.

854
01:09:12,251 --> 01:09:13,544
我們得走了
We should probably go.

855
01:09:55,795 --> 01:09:57,004
是啊
Yeah.

856
01:09:57,797 --> 01:09:59,298
我們真得走了
We should definitely go.

857
01:10:18,151 --> 01:10:20,445
抱歉忘記告訴你會定時噴水
Sorry about the sprinkler system.

858
01:10:20,862 --> 01:10:22,155
別提它了
I forgot about that.

859
01:10:25,575 --> 01:10:26,784
要去睡了嗎？
You going to sleep?

860
01:10:26,868 --> 01:10:28,327
累了嗎？
Well, aren't you tired?

861
01:10:28,786 --> 01:10:30,496
我從沒這樣清醒
I've never been more awake.

862
01:10:36,627 --> 01:10:38,671
- 西蒙，我以為你…  - 睡了？
- Simon, I thought you were... - Asleep?

863
01:10:38,838 --> 01:10:40,006
之前是的
Yeah, I was.

864
01:10:40,423 --> 01:10:41,632
我們只不過…
We were just...

865
01:10:41,716 --> 01:10:43,158
下次，最好是
Next time, it might be a nice idea

866
01:10:43,158 --> 01:10:45,261
你得說你已經有個男人在床上
to mention that you already have a man in your bed,

867
01:10:45,344 --> 01:10:47,013
我們才不會這麼尷尬了
so we can avoid such uncomfortable situations.

868
01:10:47,096 --> 01:10:48,058
你讓他到你床上？
You invited him to bed?

869
01:10:48,058 --> 01:10:49,390
我知道這挺荒唐的，是不是？
I know, it's ridiculous, isn't it?

870
01:10:49,474 --> 01:10:50,683
不可能一切合心意
We would never have all fit.

871
01:10:50,767 --> 01:10:52,643
我沒有讓他到我床上
I didn't invite him into bed.

872
01:10:52,727 --> 01:10:54,520
只是接吻而已
We were just kissing.

873
01:10:55,980 --> 01:10:57,774
你太快丟掉我倆的愛了
How swiftly you dismiss our love.

874
01:10:58,191 --> 01:10:59,358
傑斯…
Jace...

875
01:10:59,525 --> 01:11:01,152
西蒙，很晚了，對不起吵醒你
Simon, it's late, and I'm sorry we woke you.

876
01:11:01,235 --> 01:11:02,528
我也是
So am I.

877
01:11:04,530 --> 01:11:07,011
去吧，去找他，去向他道歉
Go ahead. Go after him, go apologize to him,

878
01:11:07,011 --> 01:11:09,327
去跟他說他才是特別的
go tell him just how special he really is.

879
01:11:09,410 --> 01:11:11,245
- 別這樣！  - 哪樣了？
- Stop acting like that! - Like what?

880
01:11:11,329 --> 01:11:12,651
好像你沒受傷一樣
Like nothing ever hurts you.

881
01:11:12,651 --> 01:11:14,994
嗯，也許你應該想清楚的
Well, maybe you should have thought about that

882
01:11:14,994 --> 01:11:16,042
在你親我之前
before you kissed me.

883
01:11:16,125 --> 01:11:17,460
是我親你？
I kissed you?

884
01:11:18,211 --> 01:11:20,880
別擔心，這對我也沒什麼了不起
Don't worry, it wasn't that special for me either.

885
01:11:26,219 --> 01:11:28,638
西蒙，真的很抱歉，我還以為你在…
I'm really sorry, Simon, but weren't you just in the...

886
01:11:28,721 --> 01:11:30,389
我只是在找你
I was just looking for you.

887
01:11:30,973 --> 01:11:32,809
- 你要去哪兒？  - 回家
- Where are you going? - Home.

888
01:11:32,892 --> 01:11:34,727
顯然我在這太久，不受歡迎了
It's clear I overstayed my welcome.

889
01:11:34,811 --> 01:11:37,104
對不起，這對我也太突然了
Look, I'm sorry, okay? It wasn't like it was planned.

890
01:11:37,188 --> 01:11:39,732
但就是發生了，拜託
Let me guess, it just happened. Please.

891
01:11:39,816 --> 01:11:41,484
聽著，我知道你不喜歡他，但是…
Look, I know you don't like him, but...

892
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:43,736
其實我恨他
Actually, I hate the guy.

893
01:11:44,070 --> 01:11:45,238
為什麼？
Why?

894
01:11:45,321 --> 01:11:46,614
我以為你不至於愛上他
I thought you were better than that.

895
01:11:46,697 --> 01:11:48,449
那這又說明什麼？
What's that supposed to mean?

896
01:11:48,574 --> 01:11:51,869
我才是一直等你的人，不是他
I'm the one who's always been there for you, not him.

897
01:12:01,254 --> 01:12:03,047
我早愛上你了
I'm in love with you.

898
01:12:13,474 --> 01:12:16,477
不過顯然你沒有同感
And it's clear that you don't feel the same way.

899
01:12:18,437 --> 01:12:19,772
- 這…  - 不
- It's... - Don't.

900
01:12:20,147 --> 01:12:21,983
沒什麼好說了
There's nothing to say.

901
01:12:25,486 --> 01:12:26,988
還有，克拉蕾
And, Clary,

902
01:12:27,071 --> 01:12:29,240
他只是利用你獲得聖盃
he's just using you to get the Cup.

903
01:12:35,121 --> 01:12:36,497
西蒙…
Simon...

904
01:14:30,903 --> 01:14:33,990
你母親也能這麼做
Your mother was the only other person who could do that.

905
01:14:34,615 --> 01:14:36,909
但我之前從沒這麼做過
But I've never been able to do this before.

906
01:14:37,702 --> 01:14:41,163
說明封印住的不僅是你的回憶
Apparently the block wasn't just repressing your memories,

907
01:14:41,247 --> 01:14:43,124
還有你的能力
but your abilities as well.

908
01:15:03,602 --> 01:15:05,563
- 傑斯，我…  - 別跟我說
- Jace, I... - Don't tell me.

909
01:15:05,646 --> 01:15:08,315
你急需一個裸模來畫畫
You have a drawing emergency and you need a nude model.

910
01:15:08,399 --> 01:15:10,651
- 沒那個心情  - 聽著！
- I'm not in the mood. - Listen!

911
01:15:11,277 --> 01:15:13,612
我知道我媽媽將聖盃藏哪兒了
I know where my mom hid the Cup.

912
01:15:26,792 --> 01:15:27,877
克拉蕾…
Clary...

913
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:29,920
你看上去很不同
Wow, you look different.

914
01:15:30,004 --> 01:15:32,173
嗯，這只是我借來的
Yeah, it's just something I borrowed.

915
01:15:33,090 --> 01:15:36,385
我是說，你穿得很漂亮
I mean, nice outfit. It's good.

916
01:15:36,469 --> 01:15:38,304
好吧，現在我沒空聊 抱歉
Yeah, I can't talk now. Sorry.

917
01:15:47,860 --> 01:15:50,370
（西蒙，克拉蕾剛進她家）

918
01:16:10,836 --> 01:16:13,255
- 克拉蕾  - 我來拿塔羅牌
- Clary. - I came for the tarot cards.

919
01:16:13,672 --> 01:16:14,882
- 為什麼？  - 我需要他們
- Why?          - I need them.

920
01:16:14,965 --> 01:16:16,926
你懂的，就是我媽媽畫的那些？
You know, the ones that Mom painted?

921
01:16:17,009 --> 01:16:19,146
我就想快點看看
I just need to look at them really quickly,

922
01:16:19,146 --> 01:16:20,846
然後就還你，我發誓
and I'll give them back, I promise.

923
01:16:21,388 --> 01:16:22,848
武器別帶進來
Those can't come in here.

924
01:16:23,349 --> 01:16:25,017
這是和平之地
This is a peaceful house.

925
01:16:25,810 --> 01:16:27,186
放那兒
Put them in there.

926
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:16,026
今天感覺怎麼樣？
How are you feeling today?

927
01:17:19,405 --> 01:17:21,699
很好，很好
Fine. Just fine.

928
01:17:47,892 --> 01:17:50,519
小伙子，走調了
Young man, that piano is out of tune.

929
01:17:52,104 --> 01:17:53,564
拜託別彈了
Please don't.

930
01:18:05,784 --> 01:18:07,244
小伙子
Young man.

931
01:18:10,789 --> 01:18:12,124
別彈！
Stop!

932
01:18:24,136 --> 01:18:25,471
那首曲
That song.

933
01:18:27,139 --> 01:18:28,891
不是我的最愛
Not one of my favorites.

934
01:18:50,829 --> 01:18:52,289
停下來！
Stop!

935
01:18:52,957 --> 01:18:54,250
拿來看看
Let's have a look.

936
01:19:44,049 --> 01:19:45,050
快跑！
Get out!

937
01:20:17,249 --> 01:20:18,822
你好，多蘿西夫人
Hey, Madame Dorothea.

938
01:20:18,822 --> 01:20:20,252
有看見克拉蕾嗎？
Have you seen Clary?

939
01:20:20,336 --> 01:20:22,171
我剛收到短信說她在這兒
I just got a text that said she was here.

940
01:20:22,254 --> 01:20:23,505
沒有
No.

941
01:20:23,589 --> 01:20:25,424
好吧，我只是…
Okay. Well, I'll just...

942
01:20:25,591 --> 01:20:27,009
西蒙！
Simon!

943
01:20:27,926 --> 01:20:29,428
西蒙！
Simon!

944
01:20:30,220 --> 01:20:31,513
西蒙！
Simon!

945
01:20:31,597 --> 01:20:33,599
西蒙，這不是真的她！
Simon, it's not really her!

946
01:20:35,184 --> 01:20:36,185
西蒙！
Simon!

947
01:20:37,227 --> 01:20:38,604
西蒙！
Simon!

948
01:20:43,859 --> 01:20:45,277
我來照顧他
I'll take care of him.

949
01:20:46,403 --> 01:20:47,446
西蒙！
Simon!

950
01:20:47,529 --> 01:20:49,406
她拿走了聖盃！
She's got the Cup!

951
01:21:03,253 --> 01:21:04,421
西蒙！
Simon!

952
01:21:50,968 --> 01:21:52,136
對不起
I'm sorry.

953
01:21:52,219 --> 01:21:53,929
對不起
I'm sorry.

954
01:22:06,024 --> 01:22:07,526
傑斯！
Jace!

955
01:22:11,697 --> 01:22:13,699
圖符不起作用
The runes aren't working.

956
01:22:19,538 --> 01:22:21,331
西蒙，跟著我
Simon, you follow me.

957
01:22:29,715 --> 01:22:31,049
把他們切碎
You cut these up.

958
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:34,909
不要 夠了
Don't. You've done enough.

959
01:22:34,909 --> 01:22:36,972
別這樣對她 這不是她的錯
Don't talk to her like that. This isn't her fault.

960
01:22:37,055 --> 01:22:38,932
- 不，你說的對，是你的錯  - 伊莎貝爾！
- No, you're right. This is your fault. - Isabelle!

961
01:22:39,016 --> 01:22:40,893
亞力克一直都告誡你你會受傷
Alec kept telling you that you were going to get hurt.

962
01:22:40,976 --> 01:22:42,788
你會讓我們都受傷
You were going to get us all hurt.

963
01:22:42,788 --> 01:22:43,979
現在他卻快死了
Now he's the one dying.

964
01:22:44,062 --> 01:22:45,439
我們需要找到聖盃
Well, we needed to get the Mortal Cup.

965
01:22:45,522 --> 01:22:46,961
但還有別的辦法
But there were other ways to do it

966
01:22:46,961 --> 01:22:48,484
沒必要為此傷害你的摯友
than getting your best friend killed.

967
01:22:50,861 --> 01:22:52,404
去找霍奇
Why don't you go get Hodge.

968
01:22:53,864 --> 01:22:55,741
我從沒想讓亞力克這樣
I never wanted anything to happen to Alec.

969
01:22:55,824 --> 01:22:57,242
對不起
I'm sorry.

970
01:23:01,914 --> 01:23:04,708
我們同意一起做的，我們一個團隊
We agreed to do this together. We're a team.

971
01:23:04,791 --> 01:23:07,211
有了克拉蕾，我們就不是一個團隊了
Since Clary got here, we haven't been a team.

972
01:23:11,924 --> 01:23:13,217
霍奇
Hodge!

973
01:23:13,759 --> 01:23:15,177
霍奇
Hodge!

974
01:23:16,053 --> 01:23:17,513
亞力克受傷了
Alec's getting worse.

975
01:23:17,596 --> 01:23:18,764
我知道
I know.

976
01:23:19,848 --> 01:23:21,808
我已經叫人來了
I've already sent for someone.

977
01:23:23,435 --> 01:23:25,229
你得到聖盃了嗎？
Did you get the Cup?

978
01:23:48,794 --> 01:23:50,295
然後呢？
What now?

979
01:23:55,300 --> 01:23:56,593
霍奇？
Hodge?

980
01:24:03,016 --> 01:24:05,561
你根本不知道
You have no idea what it's like

981
01:24:05,644 --> 01:24:08,146
克拉夫的詛咒是什麼滋味
living with the Clave's curse,

982
01:24:08,230 --> 01:24:10,983
不能從這兒踏出一步
unable to set so much as a foot outside,

983
01:24:11,858 --> 01:24:14,319
連開窗戶都害怕
afraid to even open a window.

984
01:24:17,155 --> 01:24:19,241
克拉蕾，別太怪我
Try not to judge me too harshly, Clary.

985
01:24:29,209 --> 01:24:30,669
霍奇，你要做什麼？
Hodge, what have you done?

986
01:24:54,484 --> 01:24:56,778
我知道你終將把聖盃給我
I always knew you would bring me the Cup.

987
01:24:56,862 --> 01:24:58,614
只是時間問題而已
It was only a matter of time.

988
01:25:01,867 --> 01:25:03,493
我媽媽在哪兒？
Where is she?

989
01:25:05,203 --> 01:25:06,455
她很好
She's fine.

990
01:25:10,667 --> 01:25:12,669
你得到了想要的，現在放她走
You got what you want. Now let her go.

991
01:25:12,753 --> 01:25:15,339
我得看看這是不是真的
I have to make sure you gave me the real one.

992
01:25:17,883 --> 01:25:20,385
每個人為了聖盃都會不擇手段
Everybody wants the Cup for the wrong reason.

993
01:25:23,138 --> 01:25:24,473
那你沒有嗎？
And you don't?

994
01:25:24,556 --> 01:25:25,932
擁有它
With this Cup,

995
01:25:26,016 --> 01:25:28,644
我才能淨化我的血統
I can cleanse our bloodlines,

996
01:25:28,727 --> 01:25:30,812
拯救我們的種族
Save our race.

997
01:25:30,896 --> 01:25:34,483
你也許不太瞭解人類歷史
You might not know much about mundane history,

998
01:25:34,566 --> 01:25:38,502
聽著，當人們談論保護種族時
but I can tell you when people start talking about preserving a race,

999
01:25:38,502 --> 01:25:39,571
從沒好事發生
it never goes well.

1000
01:25:41,239 --> 01:25:44,409
這就是為何我媽媽要用一生時間隱瞞你
That's why my mom spent her whole life hiding it from you.

1001
01:25:44,493 --> 01:25:45,744
不
No.

1002
01:25:47,079 --> 01:25:49,081
她不是要藏聖盃
She wasn't hiding the Cup.

1003
01:25:49,581 --> 01:25:51,333
她是要藏著你
She was hiding you.

1004
01:25:53,418 --> 01:25:54,461
喝下去
Drink.

1005
01:25:54,544 --> 01:25:56,421
我不會喝的
I'm not gonna drink that.

1006
01:25:56,505 --> 01:25:57,923
你為什麼這麼害怕？
Why are you so afraid?

1007
01:25:58,048 --> 01:26:00,676
你還沒出生就已經喝過它了
You've been drinking this since before you were born.

1008
01:26:00,759 --> 01:26:03,845
我在你媽媽懷孕時就給她喝過
I fed it to your mother while you were in her womb.

1009
01:26:06,515 --> 01:26:08,016
快點，克拉蕾
Come on, Clary.

1010
01:26:08,100 --> 01:26:09,851
你現在應該猜到
You must have guessed by now.

1011
01:26:09,935 --> 01:26:11,520
你所有神奇的天賦
All these amazing talents

1012
01:26:11,603 --> 01:26:14,189
都是你母親一直想要壓制的
that your mother so desperately tried to suppress,

1013
01:26:14,272 --> 01:26:16,274
你覺得它從何而來？
where do you think they came from?

1014
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:20,112
你是我女兒
You're my daughter.

1015
01:26:20,987 --> 01:26:23,824
我的血液流淌在你的身上
My blood runs in your veins.

1016
01:26:24,408 --> 01:26:25,784
現在…
Now...

1017
01:26:26,827 --> 01:26:28,036
喝
Drink.

1018
01:26:31,164 --> 01:26:32,541
快喝！
Drink!

1019
01:26:43,635 --> 01:26:45,303
把它拿出來！
Take that out!

1020
01:26:52,018 --> 01:26:53,520
不！
No!

1021
01:27:05,490 --> 01:27:07,409
有人進入穿梭門了
Someone just went through the Portal.

1022
01:27:07,492 --> 01:27:09,161
我去看看
I'll go check.

1023
01:28:44,464 --> 01:28:45,465
抱歉
Sorry.

1024
01:28:45,549 --> 01:28:46,842
我有點太激動了
I got a bit carried away.

1025
01:28:46,925 --> 01:28:48,134
盧克，你是…
Luke, you're a...

1026
01:28:48,218 --> 01:28:50,804
克拉蕾，聽我說，聽著 別害怕
Clary, listen to me, listen. Don't be afraid.

1027
01:28:50,887 --> 01:28:52,222
- 聽著，好嗎？  - 別碰我！
- Listen, right? - Don't touch me!

1028
01:28:52,305 --> 01:28:54,808
嘿，別這樣
Hey, there's no need for that.

1029
01:28:55,016 --> 01:28:56,768
那東西還會回來
That thing will be back.

1030
01:28:57,727 --> 01:28:59,729
這兒不安全
We are not safe out here.

1031
01:29:02,524 --> 01:29:05,193
我跳進穿梭門，為了躲瓦倫丁
I jumped through the Portal to get away from Valentine.

1032
01:29:05,527 --> 01:29:07,529
我以為會到我媽媽那兒
I thought I'd end up with my mom.

1033
01:29:11,366 --> 01:29:14,703
但是我卻到了最不想來的地方
Instead, I ended up in the last place I wanted to be.

1034
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:17,622
聽著，穿梭門帶你來
Listen, the Portal brought you here

1035
01:29:17,706 --> 01:29:19,875
說明你一定想到我了
because you must have been thinking of me.

1036
01:29:19,958 --> 01:29:21,877
你內心深處仍信任我
Deep inside, you know you can trust me.

1037
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:23,231
你說過一點都不在乎
You said you couldn't care

1038
01:29:23,231 --> 01:29:24,880
我們發生什麼事情
less what happened to either of us.

1039
01:29:24,963 --> 01:29:26,590
你跟別人一樣，只是想要聖盃
You just want the Cup, like everyone else.

1040
01:29:26,673 --> 01:29:28,633
我說過要保護你，我還能怎麼做？
I said that to protect you. What else could I do?

1041
01:29:28,717 --> 01:29:31,011
這次我得一直照看你
Been keeping an eye on you this whole time.

1042
01:29:39,019 --> 01:29:40,729
在旅店那兒的是你
That was you at the hotel.

1043
01:29:42,647 --> 01:29:44,566
話說投的好啊
Good throw, by the way.

1044
01:29:49,362 --> 01:29:50,530
我怎麼辦？
What about me?

1045
01:29:50,739 --> 01:29:51,990
你怎麼辦？
What about you?

1046
01:29:52,198 --> 01:29:53,366
我們說好的
We had a deal.

1047
01:29:53,450 --> 01:29:55,827
我仍然沒得到聖盃，不是嗎？
Well, I still don't have my Cup, do I?

1048
01:30:01,541 --> 01:30:03,752
我一直信守諾言
I held up my end of the bargain.

1049
01:30:05,503 --> 01:30:07,088
不，你沒有
No, you didn't.

1050
01:30:07,172 --> 01:30:09,257
我把聖盃給你了
I gave you the Cup.

1051
01:30:09,341 --> 01:30:11,843
是你給克拉蕾的 不是我的錯
You handed it to Clary. That's not my fault.

1052
01:30:11,927 --> 01:30:13,053
幫我解咒
Now lift it.

1053
01:30:15,263 --> 01:30:18,016
聽著，這都是你腦子想的
Listen, it's all in your head.

1054
01:30:18,099 --> 01:30:19,851
不，不！
No. No!

1055
01:30:22,687 --> 01:30:24,397
有詛咒
There's a spell.

1056
01:30:24,481 --> 01:30:26,524
真的？詛咒？
Really? A spell?

1057
01:30:27,025 --> 01:30:29,527
這只是問題的借口
That's just an excuse for a real problem

1058
01:30:29,945 --> 01:30:31,196
在這兒
in there.

1059
01:30:32,656 --> 01:30:34,824
你以為我真的可以解決嗎？
Do you really think I can fix that?

1060
01:30:34,908 --> 01:30:37,452
我給你聖盃了，你幫我帶走恐懼
I give you the Cup, you take away the fear.

1061
01:30:42,207 --> 01:30:44,250
沒有聖盃我也一樣寸步難行
Without the Cup, I'm as stuck as you are.

1062
01:30:45,335 --> 01:30:47,212
我的恐懼才是真的
Except my fear is real.

1063
01:30:47,295 --> 01:30:49,172
每個地下生物
Every Downworlder,

1064
01:30:49,255 --> 01:30:51,007
每個守護者
every member of the Clave,

1065
01:30:51,091 --> 01:30:53,802
每個暗影獵人都在穿梭門另一側
every Shadowhunter on both sides of the Portal

1066
01:30:53,885 --> 01:30:55,637
找我
is looking for me right now.

1067
01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:58,014
我才需要一切幫助
I'm going to need all the help I can get.

1068
01:30:58,390 --> 01:31:01,601
瓦倫丁，你不必這樣的
You don't have to go through with this, Valentine.

1069
01:31:02,185 --> 01:31:04,688
邪靈從來沒到過神院
A demon has never set foot in the Institute.

1070
01:31:06,398 --> 01:31:07,774
現在是時候讓他們來了
Well, maybe it's time they did.

1071
01:31:11,277 --> 01:31:14,823
我等這等好多年了
I've been waiting all these years to do this.

1072
01:31:17,033 --> 01:31:18,827
我別無選擇
Clary's given me no choice.

1073
01:31:22,122 --> 01:31:23,623
她會回來的
She'll come back.

1074
01:31:25,333 --> 01:31:26,543
真的嗎？
Really?

1075
01:31:27,419 --> 01:31:28,920
你敢確定？
And what makes you so sure?

1076
01:31:29,004 --> 01:31:31,923
這兒有她需要的人，像她需要她媽媽一樣
There's someone here she wants as much as her mother.

1077
01:31:32,424 --> 01:31:34,569
你可以騙他們
If you lie and tell them

1078
01:31:34,569 --> 01:31:36,886
說他們都是你的孩子
they're both your children,

1079
01:31:36,970 --> 01:31:39,097
你這樣就能讓他們心碎
you'll break their hearts.

1080
01:31:39,222 --> 01:31:40,765
那又怎麼樣？
What can I say?

1081
01:31:41,057 --> 01:31:43,143
心碎的人最聽話
The broken make the best followers.

1082
01:31:43,810 --> 01:31:45,228
看看你
Look at you.

1083
01:31:45,937 --> 01:31:48,606
愛就是滅亡
To love is to destroy.

1084
01:32:44,746 --> 01:32:46,247
霍奇到底在哪�？
Where the hell is Hodge?

1085
01:32:46,331 --> 01:32:48,041
我們沒多少時間了
We don't have much time.

1086
01:32:50,085 --> 01:32:52,295
- 這弄對了嗎？  - 不
- Does this look right to you? - No.

1087
01:32:55,173 --> 01:32:56,174
快看
Hey, look.

1088
01:32:59,094 --> 01:33:00,512
馬格努斯？
Magnus?

1089
01:33:03,014 --> 01:33:05,850
我需要這些，要很多
I'm going to need all of this. Lots of it.

1090
01:33:08,019 --> 01:33:09,354
拿著
Take this.

1091
01:33:42,887 --> 01:33:44,722
封鎖此地
Lock this place down.

1092
01:33:45,140 --> 01:33:48,476
殺死一切異族
Those who are not allies must be killed.

1093
01:34:03,616 --> 01:34:05,493
別動 它們
Don't do that!

1094
01:34:07,162 --> 01:34:08,496
瓦倫丁
Valentine.

1095
01:34:09,247 --> 01:34:10,498
喬納森
Jonathan.

1096
01:34:12,083 --> 01:34:14,210
你怎麼知道我的真名？
How do you know my real name?

1097
01:34:15,336 --> 01:34:16,713
沒人這樣叫過我
Nobody calls me that.

1098
01:34:17,755 --> 01:34:19,174
是真的嗎？
Is it true?

1099
01:34:20,508 --> 01:34:22,427
瓦倫丁是我父親？
Is Valentine my father?

1100
01:34:28,850 --> 01:34:31,019
他曾是個好人
You know, he was a great man,

1101
01:34:31,102 --> 01:34:32,604
在和守護者衝突之前
until his conflict with the Clave.

1102
01:34:33,146 --> 01:34:34,856
但你媽媽偷走聖盃後
But when your mother ran away with the Cup,

1103
01:34:34,939 --> 01:34:38,109
他害怕遭守護者懲罰
he was just so afraid of retribution from the Clave,

1104
01:34:38,193 --> 01:34:40,445
他燒燬了住處
he burned their house down to the ground.

1105
01:34:42,989 --> 01:34:45,909
他要世人相信他死了
He wanted the world to believe he was dead.

1106
01:34:47,202 --> 01:34:50,038
我們在灰燼�找到一個男人
In the ashes, we found the remains of a man

1107
01:34:50,121 --> 01:34:52,207
和小孩
and a child.

1108
01:34:52,290 --> 01:34:53,958
等等，一個小孩？
Wait a second, there was a child?

1109
01:34:54,042 --> 01:34:56,127
瓦倫丁怒火中燒
Valentine was so enraged, he wanted her to believe

1110
01:34:56,211 --> 01:34:58,713
他想要她相信他和他兒子都死了
he killed himself and their son,

1111
01:34:59,422 --> 01:35:00,882
你的哥哥
your brother.

1112
01:35:01,758 --> 01:35:03,384
我有個哥哥？
I have a brother?

1113
01:35:08,681 --> 01:35:10,516
喬納森·克�斯托弗·摩根斯坦
Jonathan Christopher Morgenstern.

1114
01:35:11,559 --> 01:35:13,144
你撒謊
You're lying.

1115
01:35:14,062 --> 01:35:16,022
我姓名是傑斯·維蘭德
My name is Jace Wayland.

1116
01:35:16,981 --> 01:35:18,650
我是維蘭德家族的
And my family are the Waylands.

1117
01:35:20,235 --> 01:35:23,821
你以為只有克拉蕾被封存了記憶嗎？
You think Clary is the only one with a block in her mind?

1118
01:35:24,948 --> 01:35:26,741
讓你看看什麼是真相
Let me show you the truth.

1119
01:35:31,913 --> 01:35:33,915
你沒有馴服它，你毀了它
You didn't tame him. You broke him.

1120
01:35:34,582 --> 01:35:36,251
不！你…
No! You...

1121
01:35:37,961 --> 01:35:39,963
你不是我父親
You are not my father.

1122
01:35:41,339 --> 01:35:44,759
我來是要讓你知道自己到底是誰
I came back to help you understand who you really are.

1123
01:35:46,636 --> 01:35:48,012
我懂你在這不開心
I know you're unhappy here.

1124
01:35:48,304 --> 01:35:49,931
要守很多規矩
Plagued by rules.

1125
01:35:51,557 --> 01:35:55,853
你的名字輩分僅次於我
Your place is next to me.

1126
01:35:56,813 --> 01:35:58,606
你是摩根斯坦家族一員
You're a Morgenstern.

1127
01:35:59,691 --> 01:36:01,359
你是我兒子
And you're my son.

1128
01:36:14,497 --> 01:36:16,207
我叫傑斯·維蘭德
My name is Jace Wayland.

1129
01:36:19,544 --> 01:36:21,045
我是維蘭德家族的
I'm a Wayland.

1130
01:36:22,088 --> 01:36:23,798
抱歉告訴你這個消息
Sorry to break this to you,

1131
01:36:23,881 --> 01:36:26,175
但也是時候該知道了
but it's time you heard the truth.

1132
01:36:26,426 --> 01:36:27,427
不
Don't.

1133
01:36:30,596 --> 01:36:32,932
只是理解方式的問題
It's all a matter of perception.

1134
01:36:35,226 --> 01:36:37,562
看到了嗎？摩根斯坦
You see, Morgenstern.

1135
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:00,877
- 拿著  - 好
- Take this. - Okay.

1136
01:37:01,336 --> 01:37:02,420
好
Okay.

1137
01:37:13,890 --> 01:37:15,141
伊莎貝爾
Isabelle.

1138
01:37:33,284 --> 01:37:34,243
克拉蕾？
Clary?

1139
01:37:34,327 --> 01:37:35,495
我們找到你媽媽了
Yeah, we found your mom.

1140
01:37:35,828 --> 01:37:36,996
他們找到她了
They found her.

1141
01:37:37,080 --> 01:37:38,956
在神院
She's at the Institute.

1142
01:37:42,460 --> 01:37:43,544
阿拉�克
Alaric.

1143
01:37:43,628 --> 01:37:45,505
我是盧克，你看到了嗎？
It's Luke. Can you see it?

1144
01:37:46,005 --> 01:37:47,090
是的，我看到了
Yeah, I see it.

1145
01:37:49,592 --> 01:37:50,718
兄弟們，得走了
Hey, guys, we have to go.

1146
01:37:50,802 --> 01:37:52,303
盧克需要咱們
Luke needs us.

1147
01:37:52,387 --> 01:37:53,930
我們去哪？
Where are we headed?

1148
01:37:54,013 --> 01:37:55,056
神院
The Institute.

1149
01:37:55,306 --> 01:37:56,891
我們這是在破壞協議
We'd be breaking the accords.

1150
01:37:56,974 --> 01:37:58,768
不變身就沒關係
Not if we stay human.

1151
01:37:59,519 --> 01:38:00,728
走，兄弟們！
Let's go, guys!

1152
01:38:00,812 --> 01:38:02,105
快走，快走！
Go, go, go, go!

1153
01:38:02,188 --> 01:38:03,439
快，動起來！
Come on, move it!

1154
01:38:12,740 --> 01:38:13,866
準備就緒！
Ready to go!

1155
01:38:13,950 --> 01:38:14,992
一切聽指揮
They've all been briefed.

1156
01:38:15,076 --> 01:38:17,370
他是阿拉�克，我們的人
This is Alaric. He's one of us.

1157
01:38:22,083 --> 01:38:23,418
走吧
Go ahead.

1158
01:38:23,501 --> 01:38:26,170
如果需要可以將頭伸出窗外
You can hang your head out the window if you need to.

1159
01:38:26,254 --> 01:38:28,172
我是狼人
I'm a werewolf

1160
01:38:28,256 --> 01:38:30,174
不是金毛犬
not a golden retriever.

1161
01:38:35,179 --> 01:38:36,347
西蒙！
Simon!

1162
01:38:39,517 --> 01:38:40,476
在這等，我會回來
Just wait here, I'll be back.

1163
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:42,770
啥？不 伊莎貝爾，我不能…
What? No. Isabelle, I can't just...

1164
01:38:42,854 --> 01:38:44,522
不，伊莎貝爾！
No. Isabelle!

1165
01:38:48,609 --> 01:38:50,528
回來，伊莎貝爾，你去哪？
Come on, Isabelle, where are you?

1166
01:38:55,158 --> 01:38:56,951
好，上！
All right, move it!

1167
01:38:57,034 --> 01:38:58,703
快點，上！
Come on, move it!

1168
01:39:05,751 --> 01:39:07,128
好吧
All right.

1169
01:39:07,211 --> 01:39:09,714
狼人來救我們了
The werewolves are here to save us.

1170
01:39:10,506 --> 01:39:12,175
難以置信我這麼說
Never thought I'd say that.

1171
01:39:17,763 --> 01:39:19,432
伊莎貝爾
Finally! Isabelle.

1172
01:39:21,434 --> 01:39:23,311
打開
Hey, open up the door.

1173
01:39:53,758 --> 01:39:55,510
起作用了
It looks like he's responding.

1174
01:39:55,593 --> 01:39:57,094
他能挺過來
He'll survive.

1175
01:40:01,015 --> 01:40:02,558
小心
And be careful.

1176
01:40:04,769 --> 01:40:06,604
有人入侵
You're being invaded.

1177
01:40:12,193 --> 01:40:14,445
召集所有邪靈…
Summoning all these bloody demons...

1178
01:40:45,142 --> 01:40:46,143
跑！
Run!

1179
01:40:54,694 --> 01:40:55,820
快跑！
Run!

1180
01:40:56,404 --> 01:40:58,823
- 走哪�？  - 那有另一個出口！
- Where are we going? - There's another exit!

1181
01:40:59,824 --> 01:41:01,367
等等
Wait.

1182
01:41:15,172 --> 01:41:16,591
伊莎貝爾！
Isabelle!

1183
01:41:17,592 --> 01:41:19,677
- 我差點殺死你了  - 是啊
- I almost killed you. - Yeah.

1184
01:41:20,678 --> 01:41:21,846
你還好嗎？
You okay?

1185
01:41:21,929 --> 01:41:23,889
- 沒事，我沒事  - 來吧
- Yeah, yeah. I'm fine. - Come on.

1186
01:41:23,973 --> 01:41:25,266
這破地方全是邪靈
This place is full of demons.

1187
01:41:25,349 --> 01:41:27,018
這不可能
That's impossible.

1188
01:41:27,268 --> 01:41:28,728
神院是聖地
The Institute is hallowed ground.

1189
01:41:28,811 --> 01:41:31,272
他們還不知情
Yeah, no one seems to have told them that.

1190
01:41:31,355 --> 01:41:33,691
肯定有內鬼放他們進來
Someone on the inside must have let them in.

1191
01:41:41,157 --> 01:41:42,575
原是救援行動
This is a rescue mission.

1192
01:41:42,658 --> 01:41:44,744
我們可沒裝備作戰
We are not equipped to fight demons.

1193
01:41:56,172 --> 01:41:57,923
- 分開！  - 這邊！這邊！
- Spread out! - That way! That way!

1194
01:42:00,134 --> 01:42:01,344
後退！快！
Move back! Come on!

1195
01:42:17,109 --> 01:42:18,736
阿拉�克，我們需要支援！
We could use some help here, Alaric!

1196
01:42:20,821 --> 01:42:22,406
阿拉�克！
Alaric!

1197
01:42:25,076 --> 01:42:27,078
振作點，這肯定還有別的出入，是吧？
Come on, there must be some other way out of here, right?

1198
01:42:27,161 --> 01:42:28,371
不，這�沒有，西蒙！
No, there isn't, Simon!

1199
01:42:28,454 --> 01:42:29,622
我們撐不了多久！
We can't hold them much longer!

1200
01:43:18,963 --> 01:43:19,964
讓開
Step away.

1201
01:43:22,049 --> 01:43:23,300
讓開！
Step away!

1202
01:43:53,289 --> 01:43:56,250
克拉蕾，這是什麼圖符？
Clary, which rune is that?

1203
01:43:57,418 --> 01:43:58,419
我也不知道，它是…
I don't know, it's just...

1204
01:43:58,502 --> 01:44:00,254
- 我從沒見過  - 真的嗎？
- I've never seen it before. - Really?

1205
01:44:00,337 --> 01:44:01,672
不在書上
It's not in the book.

1206
01:44:05,342 --> 01:44:06,761
它在消退
It's fading.

1207
01:44:29,533 --> 01:44:30,951
肯定有地方放他們進來
Here, they're coming in through somewhere.

1208
01:44:31,035 --> 01:44:32,912
我得去阻止他們
I'm going to stop them.

1209
01:44:36,749 --> 01:44:38,000
快點
Come on.

1210
01:44:38,250 --> 01:44:39,251
你們現走
You guys go.

1211
01:44:39,418 --> 01:44:40,961
我們墊後
We'll catch up.

1212
01:45:08,322 --> 01:45:09,657
不！
No!

1213
01:45:28,926 --> 01:45:30,928
他們從屋頂下來的，跟上
They're coming from the dome. Come on.

1214
01:45:43,607 --> 01:45:44,942
喬絲琳
Jocelyn,

1215
01:45:45,985 --> 01:45:47,945
我一直惦記你
you never left my heart.

1216
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:50,447
我現在帶你回家
I've come to take you home.

1217
01:45:52,658 --> 01:45:55,035
她哪兒也不去
She's not going anywhere.

1218
01:45:57,037 --> 01:45:58,998
你怎麼上來的
How did you get up here?

1219
01:46:04,378 --> 01:46:06,797
你比我想像的更強大
You're even more powerful than I anticipated.

1220
01:46:07,131 --> 01:46:08,799
離她遠點
Get away from her.

1221
01:46:14,471 --> 01:46:15,723
幹嘛？
What the hell?

1222
01:46:15,806 --> 01:46:17,600
聽他說
Just listen to what he has to say.

1223
01:46:19,226 --> 01:46:21,186
不是你想的那樣
It's not what you think.

1224
01:46:24,106 --> 01:46:25,441
終於…
Finally...

1225
01:46:27,151 --> 01:46:29,320
我的兩個孩子團聚了
Both my children together.

1226
01:46:29,403 --> 01:46:31,739
我女兒
My daughter

1227
01:46:31,822 --> 01:46:33,198
和我兒子
and my son.

1228
01:46:34,783 --> 01:46:36,535
對不起，克拉蕾
I'm so sorry, Clary.

1229
01:46:38,370 --> 01:46:39,872
我原先不知道
I didn't know.

1230
01:46:41,332 --> 01:46:43,000
瓦倫丁在撒謊
Valentine's lying.

1231
01:46:43,083 --> 01:46:45,085
你是邁克爾·維蘭德的兒子
You're Michael Wayland's son.

1232
01:46:45,169 --> 01:46:46,628
盧克說我哥哥已經死了
Luke said my brother is dead.

1233
01:46:46,628 --> 01:46:47,504
他死於火災
He died in a fire,

1234
01:46:47,588 --> 01:46:49,673
他們在灰燼�找到他遺骸
and they found his remains in the ashes.

1235
01:46:49,757 --> 01:46:51,926
我帶喬納森一起逃跑的
I took Jonathan with me when I ran.

1236
01:46:52,176 --> 01:46:54,803
那孩子遺骨是狼人所為
The bones were of a child killed by wolves.

1237
01:46:57,681 --> 01:46:59,558
但願這不是真的
I wish it wasn't true.

1238
01:47:02,519 --> 01:47:04,939
她不願意相信
She doesn't want to believe you

1239
01:47:05,814 --> 01:47:09,777
因為她愛上你了，喬納森
because she is in love with you, Jonathan.

1240
01:47:09,860 --> 01:47:12,154
我以為你叫傑斯
I thought your name was Jace.

1241
01:47:13,614 --> 01:47:15,366
傑斯是小名
Jace is a nickname.

1242
01:47:20,204 --> 01:47:22,081
喬納森·克�斯托弗…
Jonathan Christopher...

1243
01:47:24,541 --> 01:47:25,834
J.C.

1244
01:47:28,754 --> 01:47:30,089
傑斯
Jace.

1245
01:48:08,002 --> 01:48:09,253
把手在這
There's the lever.

1246
01:48:09,336 --> 01:48:11,338
你進去，我阻止他們
You go close the dome and I'll hold them off.

1247
01:48:20,097 --> 01:48:22,099
把聖盃拿出來，克拉蕾
Take out the Cup, Clary.

1248
01:48:26,812 --> 01:48:28,147
拿出聖盃！
Take out my Cup!

1249
01:48:28,230 --> 01:48:29,732
我要你拿！
I want that Cup!

1250
01:48:29,815 --> 01:48:31,442
你說過不傷害她！
You said you wouldn't hurt her!

1251
01:48:33,694 --> 01:48:34,695
夠了！
Enough!

1252
01:48:41,368 --> 01:48:42,536
說夠了
That's enough.

1253
01:48:44,288 --> 01:48:45,372
現在！
Now!

1254
01:48:50,878 --> 01:48:52,004
卡住了！
It's stuck!

1255
01:48:52,087 --> 01:48:53,297
關掉它！
Close it!

1256
01:48:53,380 --> 01:48:54,798
不行！
I can't!

1257
01:48:55,632 --> 01:48:57,468
好像少了一塊！
I think there's a piece missing!

1258
01:49:04,224 --> 01:49:05,225
克拉蕾！
Clary!

1259
01:49:25,287 --> 01:49:26,872
我非常需要它
I really need this.

1260
01:49:50,521 --> 01:49:51,688
媽媽？
Mom?

1261
01:50:48,245 --> 01:50:50,414
- 去找其他人  - 好
- Find the others. - All right.

1262
01:50:51,665 --> 01:50:55,544
好吧，你是要上還是下呢？
All right, you want to take the upstairs or the down?

1263
01:50:57,588 --> 01:51:00,215
我對底下不感冒
I'm not too crazy about the basement.

1264
01:51:06,346 --> 01:51:08,640
我撐不了太久！
I can't hold them back any longer!

1265
01:51:10,934 --> 01:51:12,436
西蒙，快點！
Simon, hurry!

1266
01:51:22,237 --> 01:51:23,864
克拉蕾！
Clary!

1267
01:51:30,787 --> 01:51:32,998
嗨，盧克先生
Hello, Mr. Garroway.

1268
01:51:33,081 --> 01:51:36,460
看起來今天你很悲劇，嗯？
Looks like you're having a rough day, eh?

1269
01:51:37,294 --> 01:51:41,924
我覺得這種情況下直接殺了你
I guess the humane thing to do in this situation

1270
01:51:42,007 --> 01:51:44,092
會仁慈點
would be to put you down.

1271
01:51:44,468 --> 01:51:46,261
你想看我變身嗎？
But you wanted to see me change.

1272
01:51:46,637 --> 01:51:47,638
是的
I do.

1273
01:51:57,856 --> 01:51:59,066
起來！
Get up!

1274
01:52:00,567 --> 01:52:03,403
那麼，你到底要反抗到什麼時候？
So, boy, how far do you want to take this?

1275
01:52:05,906 --> 01:52:07,366
到死為止
To the end.

1276
01:52:29,930 --> 01:52:31,640
西蒙！
Simon!

1277
01:53:08,802 --> 01:53:10,345
伊莎貝爾！
Isabelle!

1278
01:53:19,354 --> 01:53:20,564
靠著我
Lean on me.

1279
01:53:38,165 --> 01:53:40,167
出去！快！
Get out! Go on!

1280
01:53:40,584 --> 01:53:41,835
離開這兒
Get out of here.

1281
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:46,089
快跑！
Come on!

1282
01:53:49,551 --> 01:53:50,552
走！
Go!

1283
01:53:55,849 --> 01:53:57,851
聽說你喜歡彈琴
Somebody told me that you like to play music.

1284
01:54:01,188 --> 01:54:02,898
歌德會為此驕傲的
Johann would be very proud.

1285
01:54:13,367 --> 01:54:15,911
你該死在拉齊爾劍下
Now you shall die by Raziel's sword.

1286
01:54:16,912 --> 01:54:18,121
住手！
Stop!

1287
01:54:19,081 --> 01:54:20,165
要麼我就丟了它！
Or I'll drop it!

1288
01:54:20,957 --> 01:54:22,167
你不會那麼做的
You don't want to do that.

1289
01:54:22,793 --> 01:54:24,127
克拉蕾，別給他
Don't give it to him, Clary.

1290
01:54:31,676 --> 01:54:33,804
你先聽我說
I need you to listen to me.

1291
01:54:34,888 --> 01:54:36,139
我是你爸爸
As your father,

1292
01:54:36,223 --> 01:54:37,849
我求你了
I'm begging you.

1293
01:54:43,772 --> 01:54:45,607
要是我爸爸就一定懂我
If you'd been a real dad,

1294
01:54:45,690 --> 01:54:48,318
懂得聖盃在哪�
you'd know me well enough to imagine where the Cup is,

1295
01:54:48,402 --> 01:54:51,029
知道我心底想的地方
where my deepest thoughts are taking it.

1296
01:54:52,322 --> 01:54:55,117
你一點都不懂我
You don't know the first thing about me.

1297
01:54:56,034 --> 01:54:57,828
你不是我爸…
You're not my dad...

1298
01:54:59,204 --> 01:55:01,039
永遠不是
And you never will be.

1299
01:55:01,123 --> 01:55:03,375
我保證你不會再見到我
I promise, you'll never have to see me again.

1300
01:55:09,923 --> 01:55:11,133
克拉蕾，謝謝
Thank you, Clary.

1301
01:55:15,762 --> 01:55:18,807
沒有聖盃，我們會輸的
Without this Cup, we are lost.

1302
01:55:19,766 --> 01:55:21,017
不是「我們」
Not "we."

1303
01:55:23,311 --> 01:55:24,354
是你
You.

1304
01:55:49,296 --> 01:55:50,464
克拉蕾！
Clary!

1305
01:55:53,550 --> 01:55:55,677
- 不！抓住我！  - 決不！
- No! Don't let go! - Never!

1306
01:55:58,805 --> 01:55:59,890
這兒！
Here!

1307
01:56:58,823 --> 01:57:00,283
你還好嗎？
Are you okay?

1308
01:57:01,117 --> 01:57:02,619
我不知道
I don't know.

1309
01:57:42,284 --> 01:57:44,911
我知道你之前為什麼那樣做了
I understand why you did what you did.

1310
01:57:47,163 --> 01:57:48,832
我原諒你
And I forgive you.

1311
01:57:50,208 --> 01:57:52,168
我要你知道
I want you to know,

1312
01:57:54,254 --> 01:57:56,381
我會為你保密
your secret's safe with me.

1313
01:58:50,143 --> 01:58:52,687
她怎麼樣了？
So, how's she doing?

1314
01:58:53,396 --> 01:58:54,564
情況穩定了
Stable.

1315
01:58:55,231 --> 01:58:57,275
醫生不知道她喝過什麼
The doctors don't know what she took,

1316
01:58:57,359 --> 01:58:59,569
只能等
so we just have to wait.

1317
01:59:03,239 --> 01:59:04,991
對不起
I'm sorry.

1318
01:59:05,075 --> 01:59:07,035
我覺得我只是一個老古董
I guess I'm an old romantic.

1319
01:59:07,118 --> 01:59:09,329
我總希望當我向某人說
I always hoped that when I finally said

1320
01:59:09,412 --> 01:59:12,582
「我愛你」時，她會說同樣的話
"I love you" to someone, she'd say the same thing back.

1321
01:59:13,041 --> 01:59:14,834
那個人會的
And that someone will.

1322
01:59:14,918 --> 01:59:16,252
但願吧
Yeah, I know.

1323
01:59:25,428 --> 01:59:27,097
你很累了
Hey, you're tired.

1324
01:59:27,180 --> 01:59:29,599
去休息吧，我們會照看好她
Go sleep, we'll take care of her.

1325
01:59:30,767 --> 01:59:32,268
好，抱一個
Yeah, come on.

1326
02:00:23,737 --> 02:00:25,780
我喜歡你收拾這�
I like what you've done with the place.

1327
02:00:25,864 --> 02:00:28,324
我只是耍了些把戲
I've got a few tricks up my sleeve.

1328
02:00:30,118 --> 02:00:32,287
克拉蕾，我們真怕你不會回來了
Clary, we're afraid you're not coming back.

1329
02:00:33,830 --> 02:00:35,415
只是現在跟你作伴真的很難
It's just really hard to be around you right now.

1330
02:00:35,498 --> 02:00:37,500
對我來說也一樣
It's hard for me as well.

1331
02:00:38,835 --> 02:00:41,171
但是這不僅僅是我們
But this is about more than us.

1332
02:00:42,464 --> 02:00:45,383
你有不可思議的天賦，我們需要你
You have an incredible gift, and we need you.

1333
02:00:48,470 --> 02:00:49,846
我需要你
I need you.

1334
02:00:51,014 --> 02:00:52,682
我不知道
I just don't know.

1335
02:00:53,349 --> 02:00:55,518
還記得我說過從沒見過天使？
Remember when I said I'd never seen an angel?

1336
02:00:59,731 --> 02:01:01,191
我撒謊了
Well, I lied.

1337
02:01:10,742 --> 02:01:12,744
你是我見過最勇敢的凡人
You're still the bravest mundane I've ever met.

1338
02:01:17,207 --> 02:01:18,875
我可不是凡人
I'm not a mundane.

1339
02:01:21,503 --> 02:01:22,670
等等，傑斯！
Wait, Jace!

1340
02:01:27,008 --> 02:01:28,259
慢慢來啊
You took your time.

1341
02:01:35,225 --> 02:01:37,143
你說過你需要我
You said you needed me.

1342
02:01:42,106 --> 02:01:43,566
你該好好保存它
You should keep that safe.

1343
02:01:43,650 --> 02:01:44,776
我會的
Yeah.

1344
02:01:46,402 --> 02:01:48,112
我可以抱著你嗎…
Is it okay if I...

1345
02:01:49,072 --> 02:01:50,490
我能…
Do I...

1346
02:01:50,573 --> 02:01:52,742
- 這樣可以嗎…  - 沒關係
- Is it okay if I... - Yeah.

1347
02:01:55,995 --> 02:01:58,248
聽著，克拉蕾，我不相信它
Look, Clary, I don't believe it.

1348
02:01:58,331 --> 02:02:00,041
這似乎不是真的，不在我的心�
It doesn't feel like the truth, not in my heart.

1349
02:02:01,668 --> 02:02:04,754
我只是不懂如何去面對這個世界
I just don't know how to look at the world anymore.

1350
02:02:04,838 --> 02:02:07,632
我看不到街道，紅綠燈和車
I don't see streets and traffic lights and cars.

1351
02:02:07,715 --> 02:02:09,676
眼前只是邪靈和天使
I see demons and angels.

1352
02:02:10,635 --> 02:02:11,636
一切都變了
Everything's different.

1353
02:02:11,719 --> 02:02:13,513
世界還是一樣的
The world's the same.

1354
02:02:14,430 --> 02:02:16,724
你才是變了的那個
You're the one who's different.

1355
02:02:22,939 --> 02:02:24,566
你還記得霍奇說的嗎？
Don't you remember what Hodge said?

1356
02:02:24,649 --> 02:02:25,859
什麼？
What?

1357
02:02:25,942 --> 02:02:27,610
所以故事都是真的
All the stories are true.

1358
02:02:41,087 --> 02:02:43,658
感謝觀影
