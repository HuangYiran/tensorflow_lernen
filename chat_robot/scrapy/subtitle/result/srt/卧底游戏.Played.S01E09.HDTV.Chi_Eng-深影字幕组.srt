27
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,070
邻里又不得安宁了
Just another day in the neighbourhood.

28
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,140
继续开枪!
Keep firing!

29
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,770
我们可以用其他方法
It didn't have to go like this.

30
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,480
耶茨 不要坐那 朝他们开枪
Yates, don't just sit there, return fire!

31
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:19,910
该我们了!
Let's go!

32
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,660
安琪尔! 他中枪了 罗素
Angel! He's hit Russell.

33
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,430
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch.

34
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,700
你怎么不掩护他?
Why the hell weren't you covering him?

35
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,800
你还好吗 伙计?
You're good, okay.

36
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,130
掩护我
Cover me.

37
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,080
他中枪了! 他中枪了!
He's down! He's down!

38
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,240
待着别动
Stay here.

39
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,500
卧底游戏 第一季 第九集

40
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,740
你知道这东东太棒了
You know this thing is amazing.

41
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,300
我可以随心所欲的调整相机感光度
 I can push my ISO like crazy.

42
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:17,700
我可以在壁橱里拍照 
I could shoot in a closet

43
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,210
这样就完全不会有噪音了
and there would be zero noise.

44
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,210
好了 别拍了
Come on.

45
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,180
你应该让我给你拍完 你真是帅呆了
You should let me take your picture, you're a beautiful man.

46
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,280
我让你拍过 在墨西哥戴着墨西哥帽
I do let you; that one time in Mexico wearing the sombrero.

47
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,920
我想起来了 你喝醉了望着我出神
Yeah and you were drunk and mooning me.

48
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,890
快去工作吧
Go to work.

49
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,750
你害怕相机会泄漏你内心的秘密 
You're scared the camera's gonna reveal your deep dark secrets to me.

50
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,970
我说的对吗?
 Am I right?

51
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,740
如果你发现我是个烂人怎么办?
What happens if you find out what a terrible person I am?

52
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:56,040
那看我运气了
I'll take my chances.

53
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:56,870
再见
Bye.

54
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,070
晚上见
See you tonight.

55
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:09,050
反黑组  负责调查枪支和帮派案件
The SMASH unit. Guns and Gangs.

56
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,090
我们认为里面可能有猫腻
We think there could be a coverup.

57
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,220
反黑组发起枪战
SMASH guys initiated the shoot out.

58
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,060
理由并不充分
We're not convinced they had cause.

59
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,700
我们关注他们有一段时间了 
We've been concerned with this unit for some time.

60
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,060
包括作战策略 武力使用
 Their tactics, their use of force.

61
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,620
那为什么还让他们执行任务呢?
So why haven't you pulled them from duty?

62
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,980
因为还没有足够的证据 
We haven't been able to prove anything.

63
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,120
这就是我找你们的原因
That's where you come in.

64
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,360
这个家伙是一个犯案累累的恶棍
This guy was a veteran banger,

65
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,400
背负了八条罪行 毒品买卖 故意伤害
Eight convictions. Trafficking, aggravated assault.

66
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,560
等等 你们想调查反黑组?
Wait a second, you're actually going to go after the SMASH unit?

67
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,940
你们认为这样做很聪明吗? 
You think that's wise?

68
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,010
他们可是功勋卓著的警察
These guys are decorated cops.

69
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:31,390
几乎算得上是警界的摇滚明星了
They're pretty much rock stars.

70
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,110
那我确信你们不会有任何发现
Then I'm sure you won't find anything.

71
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,410
如果我们有发现呢? 他们人脉很广
And if we do? They're also well connected.

72
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,310
CIU刚刚成立不久 这会毁了我们的
The CIU is still a new unit, this could finish us.

73
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,790
你们的存在就是为了接手这样的任务
An assignment like this is why you're in the budget.

74
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,950
丽贝卡 这次任务没有讨价还价的余地
It isn't up for debate, Rebecca.

75
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:45,300
如果你认为这些人没有撒谎 
If you think these guys aren't lying,

76
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,160
那就去证明
then prove it.

77
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:53,890
丹尼尔就是从那出来的 你知道是吗?
That's Daniel's old unit, you know that right?

78
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,400
你说真的吗? 我们要和内务部合作?
You're serious? We're working with Internal Affairs?

79
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,550
关于调查其他警察不是有规定的吗?
Isn't there like a rule about looking into other cops?

80
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,000
是的 规定是你不能这么做
Yeah, the rule is: You don't do it.

81
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,670
甚至想都不能想
You don't even think about it.

82
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,770
丹尼尔 你和他们共事过
Daniel, you ran with these guys.

83
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,780
给我们介绍一下?
You want to set it up?

84
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,300
在反黑组
The SMASH unit.

85
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,710
我和一些最好的警察合作
Some of the best cops I've worked with.

86
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,580
他们横扫大街小巷 进行大量的逮捕行动
They pound the streets. They make a ton of arrests.

87
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,540
偶尔有些莽撞 
Sometimes they get a little cowboy,

88
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,390
不是每个人都能理解他们的做法
not everyone understands that.

89
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,820
特别是内务部
Especially Internal Affairs.

90
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,960
安琪尔・阿巴诺 其中一个成员
Angel Abano, one of their guys.

91
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,960
在这次枪击事件中受伤
He was injured during the shoot out.

92
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,700
他们需要有人来顶替他
They need someone to take his place.

93
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:28,890
杰西是最佳人选
That's going to be Jesse.

94
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,630
他是新来的 他们肯定不认识他
He's new, they won't know him.

95
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,260
丹尼尔 你协助杰西准备
Daniel, I'm going to list you as a reference;

96
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,130
一些书面材料
 on Jesse's paperwork

97
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:34,150
我需要你都准备好
I need you to set it up.

98
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,100
如果我拒绝呢?
What if I refuse?

99
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,870
那你可以从交通部给我打电话
Then you can give me a call from traffic duty,

100
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:39,310
提醒我在三十度的高温下那身警服多么难受
remind me how itchy that poly blend is in 80 degree heat.

101
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,440
关于这件事你们谁都没有我难受
None of you get to act like you're any more upset about this than I am.

102
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,380
但我们的工作是找出真相
Our job is to find out the truth.

103
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,690
关于枪击他们究竟有没有撒谎? 
Are they lying about the shooting?

104
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:48,100
如果说了谎 那事实是什么?
If so, what really happened out there?

105
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,970
如果他们是清白的 我们就找出证据
If they're clean, we prove it and

106
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:50,850
内务部也会撤销调查
IA steps down.

107
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:53,590
就像处理其他案件一样
We treat this like any other case.

108
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,160
杰西
Jesse.

109
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:12,370
好吧 听着
Alright, listen up.

110
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:16,200
罗素・哈格勒 是反黑组的老大
Russell Hagler, he runs the unit.

111
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,690
你需要让他记住你 
He's the one you need to impress,

112
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,060
他是整件事情的关键
he's the key to this whole thing.

113
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,650
你们两个关系很好?
You two were close?

114
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,280
没错
Yeah.

115
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,190
罗素是我的导师 我们在一起三年
Russell was my mentor; three years.

116
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,560
他就像我的兄长
He's like a big brother.

117
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,030
那个家伙呢?
What about that guy?

118
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,460
他是罗素的得力助手 凯文・耶茨
That's Russell's right-hand man; Kevin Yates.

119
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,960
他是个好人 好警察
He's a good guy, real police.

120
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,410
好吧 我们去告诉丽贝卡你准备好了
Alright, let's go tell Rebecca you're ready.

121
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,350
丹尼尔会安排杰西和他们认识
Daniel will set up the first introduction.

122
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,870
反黑组的人总去同一个酒吧
The SMASH guys always drink at the same bar;

123
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:00,900
我们就在那行动
 we'll do it on their home turf.

124
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:03,450
杰西需要给他们留下好印象
Jesse needs to make a good first impression,

125
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,070
能否打入反黑组就看这了
his entry into the unit depends on it.

126
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,490
丹尼尔做好掩护
Daniel will run cover.

127
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,350
我希望每个人都拿出最好的表现来
I want everyone on their A game.

128
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,940
进展越快 
The faster we move,

129
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,290
这件事就越早结束
the faster we can close the book on this.

130
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:17,500
耶 龙舌兰酒!
Yeah, tequila!

131
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,900
我一直在想 我们都是警察
I keep thinking, we're cops,

132
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,690
应该相互保护
we're supposed to protect each other.

133
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,820
没错 继续这么想
Yeah, you keep thinking that.

134
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,910
听着 他们有时会测试你 明白吗?
Look, at some point, they're going to test you, okay?

135
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,960
这是一种入会测试 随机应变就好了
It's an initiation. Just roll with it, okay?

136
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:32,620
你呢 准备好了吗?
What about you. You up for this?

137
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:36,790
是的 轮到我倒霉
Hell yeah, time of my damn life.

138
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,460
浪子回头金不换
The prodigal son returns.

139
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:43,550
我一走近就闻到怪味
I knew I smelled something when I walked in here.

140
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,890
你口臭还没好 嗯庞兹?
You still got that halitosis problem, eh Pounds?

141
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:49,030
你给我个热吻就知道了
Why don't you gimme a kiss, and you'll find out.

142
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:53,070
你确定今晚没有任务吗?
Sure tonight's not gonna be too much action for you?

143
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,710
真希望你能和我们痛饮几杯 老朋友
Hope you're up for some drinking, my friend.

144
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,480
这是杰西・波顿 刚从安大略警察学校毕业
Here he is, Jesse Borden, straight out of OPC.

145
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:02,650
班里的高材生 警校中的佼佼者
Hotshot of his class. The academy's best kept secret.

146
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,280
是吗?
Is that so?

147
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,680
你还没有解释为什么想加入我们组
Doesn't explain why you wanna be in my unit.

148
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,490
我从小就立志帮助人民
Ever since I was a kid. I wanted to help people.

149
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,050
保护人民
Protect them.

150
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:12,260
无意冒犯 孩子 
Well, no offense kid,

151
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,160
但我们追逐的是大街上的垃圾
 but we chase street waste.

152
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,490
你想拯救人民 应该去当护士
You wanna save people, go be a nurse.

153
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:18,360
嘿 你淡定些
Hey, you gotta settle down.

154
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,730
还没正式加入这小子就要被你吓跑了
You're gonna scare the kid off before we even started.

155
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:24,080
丹尼小子 你看起来很好
You look good, Danny Boy.

156
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,730
过来 我请你喝一杯
 C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.

157
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,370
你要过来坐下吗?
You gonna sit down?

158
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,310
泰瑞怎么样?
How's Terri?

159
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,770
自从我加入凶杀组之后我们就没见过
You haven't seen me since I took homicide,

160
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:35,710
你还认为我和同一个女人在一起?
and you automatically think I'm with the same woman?

161
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,780
今年冬天我们就要结婚了
We're getting married this winter.

162
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,520
还是我认识的丹尼・普莱斯
Same old Danny Price.

163
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,290
我见过的最忠诚的男人
Most loyal guy I've ever known.

164
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,190
嘿 伙计 安琪尔怎么样?
Hey look man, how's Angel?

165
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:48,720
他恢复的很好 他很坚强
He's doing alright, he's tough.

166
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,660
你听说耶茨要退休了吗?
You hear Yates is retiring?

167
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:51,660
是吗?
Yeah?

168
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:54,610
他年纪大了 行动也缓慢了 
He's getting old and soft.

169
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:56,400
我需要新鲜血液
I need somebody young.

170
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:59,130
这个杰西看起来有些娘娘腔
This Jesse kid looks straight laced.

171
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:00,800
你觉得他合适吗?
Is he going to fit in?

172
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,940
他还不错 争强好斗 我认识他哥哥
He's good, scrappy. I know his brother.

173
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:05,710
不要被这个帅小伙的表面迷惑
Don't let the pretty boy routine fool you.

174
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:06,970
他可不好惹
 He's a tough kid.

175
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:11,180
杰西 喝完它 这都是免费的
Drink up, Jesse, they're on the house.

176
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:13,010
他们知道我们是警察?
They know we're cops?

177
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:16,520
小子 这儿每个人都知道我们是谁
Kid, everybody here knows who we are.

178
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:27,360
我们给杰西准备一间公寓 
We'll set up a cover apartment for Jesse.

179
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,460
监听装置已经安好了
 It'll be fully wired.

180
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,550
卡丽负责安装摄像头和麦克 
Khali will set up cameras and mics.

181
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,700
覆盖整个住所
Full coverage.

182
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:34,320
耶茨肯定有问题
There's something going on with Yates.

183
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,950
他在隐瞒什么
He's hiding something.

184
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,970
我被他盯上了
I got a hit off him.

185
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:39,970
你是团队里的新人
You're the new guy on the team.

186
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,290
他们所有人都会观察你
They're going to be watching you, all of them.

187
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:42,360
我不知道
I don't know,

188
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,480
耶茨给人感觉不一样 他更紧张
Yates felt different, he's more intense.

189
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,610
那你多关注他一下 这样行吗?
Then you keep an eye on him, alright?

190
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,550
不要乱说话
Don't make up stories.

191
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,990
嘿 你过来
Hey, come here.

192
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,430
我希望你对他说话客气点 
I want you to go easy on him.

193
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,910
如果他告诉你他被盯上了 
 If he tells you he got a hit,

194
00:07:58,910 --> 00:07:59,530
你听着就是
you listen.

195
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,650
我现在不需要你鼓舞士气
I don't need a pep talk right now.

196
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,370
你是不是有什么事瞒着我?
Is there something you're not telling me?

197
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:06,200
公事公办 我们干活儿就是了
It's business. Let's just do the job.

198
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,100
嘿
Hey.

199
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,270
去睡会吧
Get some sleep.

200
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,240
你还好吗?
How you doing?

201
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,610
好多了
I've been better.

202
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,980
所有的摄像头和麦克已经安装好了
I've got cameras and mics in place.

203
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,580
明天就可以用了
They'll be up by tomorrow.

204
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,160
完全覆盖 除了...
Full coverage, everything except...

205
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,250
除了卧室?
Except bedroom?

206
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,150
晚安 杰西
Good night, Jesse.

207
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:38,830
嘿
Hey.

208
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:41,930
我很想你
I miss you.

209
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:46,040
你需要休息
You need to sleep.

210
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:50,910
我要马上离开这 不然又会做出蠢事来
And I need to get out of here before I do something stupid.

211
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,650
有空聊  好吗?
Talk to you later, okay?

212
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,810
卡丽
Khali.

213
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,270
想出去兜兜风吗?
You feel like taking a ride?

214
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,370
嘿 怎么了?
Hey, what's going on?

215
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:25,410
今晚有任务?
We working tonight?

216
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,980
嘿 你们这是做什么?
Hey, what are you doing?

217
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:30,210
没事的
This won't hurt a bit.

218
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,790
我没让你动别动
Don't move until I tell you.

219
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:47,260
你以为你突然冒出来就可以加入我们组?
So, think you can just show up out of nowhere and join my unit?

220
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,000
小子 这次是玩真的
This is the real deal, kid.

221
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,600
你有这个本事在这吗?
You got what it takes to be here?

222
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,510
我想我有
I think so.

223
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,740
不 你或者是有 或者没有
No, you either do or you don't!

224
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,210
去你妈的
Screw you.

225
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,910
很好 这才像样
Good. That's more like it.

226
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:08,530
那间屋里有三公斤海洛因 
There are three kilos of H inside that house,

227
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:09,820
或许更多
 maybe more.

228
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:14,590
你进去找出来拿给我
You're going to go in there and get it for me.

229
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,590
有搜查令吗?
What about a warrant?

230
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:20,500
不要担心这个 我们都准备好了
Don't worry about that, we've got it covered.

231
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:22,130
快去!
Move!

232
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,200
你想加入反黑组 就要学会随机应变
You want to run with SMASH, learn to improvise.

233
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,540
现在快去
Now go.

234
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,540
随机应变
Improvise

235
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,730
警察!
Police!

236
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:57,670
别动!
Don't move!

237
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,170
我们拿到搜查令来搜查你的住所 把枪放下
We have a warrant to search the premises. Put the weapon down

238
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,170
你们不能闯入我的房子
You can't just come into my house.

239
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,140
得了 安德烈 你还是老实点
C'mon, Andre, be a good boy;

240
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,910
告诉我们毒品在哪
 Tell us where the drugs are.

241
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:10,840
死去吧 除非我见到搜查令
Screw you man, not till I see your warrant.

242
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,380
你想看我的搜查令 安德烈?
You wanna see my warrant, Andre?

243
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:17,550
我看看我能不能找到 哈哈
Let's just see if I can find my warrant, huh.

244
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,930
不 不在这
Nope. Not here.

245
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:30,430
嘿 嘿! 不要碰 
Hey, hey! Don't touch that.

246
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:33,060
那是我妈妈的东西
That was my mom's stuff.

247
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,770
哎呀
Whoops.

248
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,860
罗素 你怎么看 
What do you think, Russell?

249
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,410
我该放过这玩意儿吗
Should I leave this stuff alone?

250
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,380
你晓得我们为何而来
You know what we came for.

251
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,660
好吧
All right.

252
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,880
来啊 安德烈 毒品在哪里
Come on, Andre, where are the drugs?

253
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:57,120
别别别 放过它 别碰它
No, no, no. Leave that alone, don't touch it.

254
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,620
伙计 你们在干嘛
What are you doing man?

255
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,760
你刚说这曾是你妈妈的东西
You said this was your mom's stuff.

256
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,160
那这一定就是你妈妈喽
This must be your mom, then.

257
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,380
把它放下
Put that down.

258
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,440
快放下
Put it down.

259
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,150
我就把它放在这里
I'll put it right over here.

260
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:11,350
你觉得这东西能漂多远 安德烈
How far down you think this thing goes, Andre?

261
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,020
想猜猜吗
You wanna take a guess?

262
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:14,620
来呦 毒品在哪儿
C'mon, where's the drugs?

263
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:18,220
你最好告诉他 安德烈
You better tell him, Andre.

264
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,860
住手
Stop!

265
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:22,160
她在这里
There she goes.

266
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:23,290
不要
No!

267
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,870
放聪明点
Be smart.

268
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,700
拿不到东西我们不会走的
We're not leaving without the stuff.

269
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:32,510
你想搞得多困难 随你的便
It's up to you how hard you wanna make this.

270
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:35,210
好吧 你是头儿
Okay, you're the boss.

271
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:40,210
好吧好吧
Okay! Okay! Okay!

272
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,610
我告诉你们 快住手吧
I'll tell you. Just stop!

273
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,830
啥
What?

274
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:48,550
就在空调后面 全部都在
It's in the air conditioner out back. All of it.

275
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,420
把它给我
Give me that.

276
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,890
哈哈 妈妈的乖宝宝
Ha ha, Mama's boy.

277
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,400
你有病 孩子 你知道吧
You're sick, kid, you know that, right?

278
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,270
而你呢 则是幸运地逃过一劫
And you, you're getting off lucky.

279
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:12,540
耶茨 你可找到我们了
Yates, you found us.

280
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:15,310
我还以为今晚不会这么做的
I thought we weren't doing this tonight.

281
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:18,480
那好 我忘记给你打电话了
Yeah well, I guess I forgot to call you.

282
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,790
今晚这里发生的事
What went on here tonight,

283
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,360
喜欢不
you like it?

284
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:33,530
是不是你的作风
Is that your style?

285
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,000
- 我只是在做本分工作 - 是吗
- I was just doing my job, man. - Yeah?

286
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:40,000
只会越来越糟
It only gets worse from here.

287
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,400
最好做好准备
You better get ready.

288
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:50,200
昨晚反黑组强闯民宅
So last night, SMASH unit broke into a civilian's house,

289
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,280
又打又砸 暴力胁迫房主
trashed it, and threatened him with violence.

290
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,020
却没有提出一项指控
They didn't lay a single charge.

291
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,950
瞧 我不知道会这么失控
Look, I don't know it would get out of hand like that.

292
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,980
他只是试着恐吓罗素 奏效了
He was trying to impress Russell, and it worked.

293
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,010
是个入会测试 杰西出色地通过了
It was an initiation and Jesse passed, with flying colors.

294
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:03,860
昨晚发生的事很好 他加入了
What happened last night was good. He's in.

295
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,290
我们想努力证明反黑组在照章办事
We're trying to prove the unit's doing things by the book.

296
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,740
如果昨晚的任何迹象
If last night's any indication...

297
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,100
昨晚什么也说明不了
Last night doesn't prove anything.

298
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:11,940
有时候你得打破规矩 那些人懂
Sometimes you gotta bend the rules. These guys know that.

299
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,940
你是在告诉我你会闯进别人家
You're telling me you would go into someone's house,

300
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,260
破坏财产 施以威胁吗
damage their property, threaten them.

301
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,680
我会 如果有必要
Yes I would, if I had to.

302
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:19,800
三公斤海洛因今天早上被查获
Three kilos of heroin went into lock up early this morning,

303
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,340
反黑组
care of SMASH unit.

304
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,370
好现象?
Silver lining?

305
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,490
二把手 耶茨 突袭的时候他不在
The second in command, Yates. He wasn't there for the raid.

306
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,420
之后才来
Showed up later.

307
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,710
你说过他们之间关系有点紧张?
You said there was tension?

308
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:30,690
非常紧张
Big time.

309
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:31,770
好吧
All right.

310
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:36,260
有分歧了 要是他们不和 罗素就会寻找同盟
That's a crack. If they're on the outs, Russell's going to be looking for allies.

311
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:41,130
我想要你密切关注 让他知道你很忠心
I want you to stay close, show him you're going to be loyal.

312
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:54,250
没必要让内务部的知道昨晚的行动
Hey, there's no reason to let IA know about last night's stunt.

313
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:55,880
别对我说你不担心
Don't tell me you're not concerned?

314
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:58,020
反黑组了解法律
The SMASH unit they know the law.

315
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:59,630
如有必要他们会稍微有点越线
They play in the grey when they need to.

316
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,860
丽贝卡 之前我也见过你越线行事
I've seen you bend rules before Rebecca.

317
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,040
别跟我提什么兄弟之谊
Don't give me the brotherhood speech.

318
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,120
我是警察 我知道什么叫互相保护
I'm a cop, I know what it means to protect each other.

319
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,380
接着该是"但是"了
And here comes the "But".

320
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:07,810
如果他们是这样做事的话
If this is how these guys operate,

321
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:10,750
你觉得他们不会掩盖非法枪杀吗?
you don't think they'd cover up an illegal shooting?

322
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,850
你知道 你现在参与了谋杀
You're part of a murder now, you know.

323
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:23,830
你通过了测试
You passed the test.

324
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,990
你说"谋杀"是什么意思
What are you talking about a "murder"?

325
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,890
你知道人们都以为老鹰很厉害
You know everybody thinks eagles are baddass '

326
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,030
因为它们独自飞翔
cause they fly alone,

327
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,800
但是它们抓不了乌鸦
but they got nothing on crows.

328
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,930
你单独行动就会挂掉
You fly alone, you get yourself killed.

329
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:37,270
反黑组 像乌鸦一样追杀猎物
The unit, is like a murder of crows.

330
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:39,870
乌鸦们在一起决定他人的命运
Crows'll gather to decide the capital fate of another.

331
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,140
有自己的规矩
Make their own laws.

332
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:44,210
我们是和地头蛇对抗 我们赢不了 杰西
We're in a war against the streets, we can't win, Jesse.

333
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,640
你得选择站在哪边
You gotta choose which side of the battle you're on.

334
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:51,120
给你 双份奶油 双份糖
Here, double cream, double sugar.

335
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,280
警察 不许动
Hey! Police don't move!

336
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,480
你不知道自己在干什么 兄弟
You don't know what you're doing, man.

337
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,110
看起来你被抓到非法持有毒品
It looks like I got you on unlawful possession.

338
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,730
你不会想这样
You don't want to do that.

339
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:16,980
这个呢 非法持有毒品 意图贩卖
And what's this? Possession for the purposes of.

340
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,350
杰西 住手
Jesse, you've gotta stop.

341
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,290
放他走
Let him go.

342
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,690
你开玩笑吧
Are you serious?

343
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,780
他这儿有三克 我在他内裤里找到了点三八
He's got like 3 grams here; I just found a .38 in his underwear.

344
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,760
这么少 根本不值得我们花时间拘捕他
That little bit? Time we spend processing this guy.

345
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,270
你想告诉我罗素发生么神经
You wanna tell me what the hell's going on with Russell?

346
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,940
我很想告诉你怎么回事 
I'd like to coach,

347
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,780
不过我自己现在也看不明白了
but I'm pretty much in the dark myself.

348
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,970
上车 别动
Get in the car. Don't move.

349
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:56,010
看见没 他把他的枪还回去了
You see this? He just gave him his gun back.

350
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:57,980
我去抓那小子
I'm bringing the kid in.

351
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:00,590
你跟着杰西
You stay with Jesse.

352
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,400
卢卡斯・史密斯, 也称作 卢克宝贝
Lucas Smith, AKA Baby Luke.

353
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:16,250
在少管所呆过一段时间 三年内没有被抓过
Did a stint in juvie, no arrests in 3 years.

354
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:17,850
是马尔沃黑帮的知名成员
Known member of the Marvo Crew.

355
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:22,440
是反黑组所管辖区内最大的黑帮
Which is the biggest gang in the SMASH unit's jurisdiction.

356
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:26,440
如果真有那么大 怎么几乎没有逮捕记录
If they're so big how come there are hardly any arrests in here?

357
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,650
马尔沃黑帮非法的行当经营的不错
The Marvo Crew run a pretty good racket

358
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,130
反黑组睁一只眼闭一只眼
Must be nice to move all that dope,

359
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:34,590
毒品运输一定畅通无阻
 while SMASH unit looks the other way.

360
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,920
你给他们多少钱
How much you pay them?

361
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:37,920
反黑组 反黑组是什么?
SMASH, what's SMASH?

362
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,260
我不知道你在说什么 女士
I don't know what you're talking about, lady.

363
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:42,250
不知道 那为什么今天他们在你身上
No? Then why did they let you walk

364
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,600
找到枪支毒品还放你走了
 when they found drugs and a gun on you today?

365
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,180
没让我走多远 我现在不是在这儿吗
Didn't let me walk far, I'm in here aren't I?

366
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,410
是我的人抓你的 不是反黑组
It was my people who brought you in, not SMASH.

367
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:49,900
说吧 卢克 你给那些警察多少钱
C'mon, Luke, how much are you paying those cops?

368
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,880
一定得让他们觉得值得 对吧
It's got to be enough to make it worth their while, right?

369
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,050
我没什么好说的
I've got nothing to say to you

370
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,760
你们干嘛不趁现在去把我律师找来呢?
so why don't you run and get my lawyer now?

371
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,360
好消息是你不需要律师
See, that's the good news. You don't need a lawyer.

372
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,880
我们要放了你
We're going to let you go.

373
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,710
不过首先我们会给反黑组打个电话
But first we're gonna put a call into the SMASH guys

374
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:01,850
告诉他们你说了什么
 and tell them what you said.

375
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:03,390
你怎么说他们的
How you told us all about them.

376
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,600
他们怎么受贿 还有他们的非法勾当
How they're taking bribes, how they're dirty...

377
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,150
我可什么也没说啊
I didn't say any of that.

378
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:09,650
那好 那就坐着好好看着
Okay. We'll just sit back and watch.

379
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:10,800
你不必告发他们
You don't have to rat them out.

380
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,880
我们来看看他们怎么收拾你
We just wait to see what they do to you.

381
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,130
那就是我们的证据 对吧
And that will be our evidence, right?

382
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,820
好吧好吧 我接受指控 承认有罪 
All right look, I'll take the charge, plead guilty,

383
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,300
你们想怎样都行 就是别
 whatever you want. All right just...

384
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:22,500
拜托 别这样
please, don't do this.

385
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,300
你真的这么怕他们
You're really that afraid of them?

386
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:27,300
你得告诉我原因
You need to tell me why.

387
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:30,340
我会找人护送你出去 来吧
I'll get someone to escort you out of here. Come on.

388
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:31,970
放开我 等等 好啦
Let me go! Wait. Alright!

389
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,980
你放出话我是告密者 
You put it out there I'm a rat

390
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,140
那他们两方都会想让我死
 they're both gonna want me dead.

391
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,250
两方
Both?

392
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,350
这是什么意思
What's that supposed to mean?

393
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,320
你们还不懂吗
Don't you get it?

394
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,320
他们是合作的
They're working together.

395
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,950
警察和马尔沃黑帮他们是一伙的
Those cops and the Marvo Crew, they partnered up.

396
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,920
穿一条裤子
They're working the hood together.

397
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,330
反黑组是真正的老大
SMASH is running the whole show.

398
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,190
好吧 坐下
Alright, sit down.

399
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:01,270
跟紧我 杰西 我会照顾你
Stick with me, Jesse, I'll take care of you.

400
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,300
我能成为你最好的朋友 别忘了这个
I can be your best friend, don't forget that.

401
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:07,410
看看这些人 M3青年军 曾经统治这一带
See these guys, M3 Colts. Used to run this neighborhood,

402
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,510
直到我们来把他们赶走
before we came in and cleaned it up.

403
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,550
这么想抓捕罪犯? 我们就去抓一个
Wanna make an arrest so badly? Let's make one.

404
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,840
我们在这儿没事 罗素 没事
We're good here, Russell, it's fine.

405
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,320
这些人什么都没带
These guys are clean.

406
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:19,290
我可不这么想
Doesn't look fine to me.

407
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,920
杰西 检查一下后座
Jesse, check the backseat,

408
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,520
告诉我发现了什么
 tell me what you see.

409
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:31,360
罗素 你在干什么
What are you doing, Russell?

410
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:40,970
什么也没有
Nothing in there.

411
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:42,410
什么也没有
Nothing in there.

412
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,940
真的
Really?

413
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,670
真的啊 罗素
Really now, Russell.

414
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,920
这是什么
What's this?

415
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,550
祝贺了 孩子
Congrats, kid.

416
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:57,890
你可以进行你的第一次抓捕行动了
You get to make your first arrest.

417
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:13,700
我真受够了内务部的人四处找茬
I was pissed enough that Internal Affairs was poking around,

418
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,970
- 然后我接到你的电话 - 先生
- then I get your call. - Sir.

419
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,770
你有一点概念
Do you have any idea...

420
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,510
那个枪击案有问题 长官
The shooting wasn't clean, sir.

421
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:21,060
反黑组和一个叫做马尔沃黑帮的帮派结盟
The SMASH unit is allied with a gang, the Marvo Crew.

422
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,430
他们是为了地盘才杀死了那孩子
They shot that kid over turf.

423
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,570
你怎么知道的?
You know this, how?

424
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,550
某个下三滥的毒贩子告诉你的?
Some scumbag drug dealer told you?

425
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:27,360
我是说那孩子希望和你做交易丽贝卡
I mean the kid's looking for a deal, Rebecca.

426
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,270
指控四个警察是自杀行动 不是交易
Accusing four cops is a suicide play, not a deal.

427
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:34,120
我的人看见罗素・哈格勒把武器还给帮派成员
My guys witnessed Russell Hagler returning a weapon to a gang member.

428
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:37,150
我现在就能逮捕他
I could arrest him right now.

429
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:39,790
我和你一样不喜欢这样做
Look, I hate this as much as you do.

430
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,520
你想借我的手来做 所以你才给我打电话?
You want to hand this off to me, is that why you called?

431
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,330
不是的 先生 我想追查下去
No sir, I want to pursue it.

432
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,900
如果我们不的话 我们也是纵容他们
If we don't, we're choosing to look the other way.

433
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:49,730
兄弟情谊也是有限度的
There's a point where the brotherhood ends.

434
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:52,470
你得到的消息可能没有任何意义
The information you've come across could be nothing.

435
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,480
不是这样的
It isn't.

436
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,860
不管你的人看见什么
Whatever your guys think they saw...

437
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:55,940
我们都不知道情况
we don't know what that was.

438
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,160
这么说以想把这事压下去?
So you're planning to bury this?

439
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,640
小心
Hey, careful.

440
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,510
要是你追查 结果你错了
If you pursue this, and you're wrong?

441
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,950
你就死定了 
You'll go down, hard.

442
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,980
这个行动组 你的事业 
This unit, your career,

443
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:08,350
你以为你知道的事情 都没了
whatever you thought you knew, will be gone.

444
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,620
长官 无意冒犯您
Due respect, sir,

445
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:12,890
你该想想如果我是对的怎么办?
you need to start thinking about what could happen if I'm right.

446
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,690
如果你对了 我会保护你
If you're right, I'll protect you.

447
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,390
但是到现在为止 侦探长
But so far, Detective Sergeant?

448
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:19,890
我还还是不相信
I'm unconvinced.

449
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:32,770
你觉得卢克孩子说的是真的
You think that kid Luke's telling the truth?

450
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:35,740
反黑组和马尔沃一起干
SMASH is working with the Marvos.

451
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:40,580
看起来是的
Looks that way, yeah.

452
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,720
所有人到简报室集合 立刻
I want everyone in briefing, now.

453
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:52,690
你要想想你的声誉 你以后的警察生涯
You need to think about your reputation, your future as cops.

454
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:54,460
你们自己决定
It's your decision.

455
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,960
如果你要抓其他警察 这事会跟你一辈子
If you go after other police, that's going to stick.

456
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,530
那么这卢克小子说的话就是铁板钉钉了
So this Luke kid, his word is iron clad?

457
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:04,070
丹尼尔 你亲眼看见罗素把武器还给那小子
Daniel, you watched Russell hand that weapon back to that kid yourself.

458
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,640
杰西看见他用毒品栽赃
Jesse saw him planting drugs.

459
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:07,670
那我们为什么不去抓他?
So why aren't we picking him up?

460
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:10,980
因为我想拿下所有人 一网打尽
Because I want them all. The entire unit.

461
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:15,010
我不强迫你 做不做由你
I'm not ordering you to do this. It's up to you.

462
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:17,230
从现在开始 
From this point on,

463
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:20,050
你自己决定要不要继续跟进这个案子
if you move forward with this operation it's because you chose to.

464
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:31,560
好的 我们支持你
Alright, so we're with you.

465
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,630
好
Okay.

466
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:34,900
我们确信Smash跟马尔沃黑帮同流合污
We believe that SMASH is in bed with The Marvo Crew.

467
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:37,470
卢克说  马尔沃进出无碍
According to Luke, the Marvos get a free pass.

468
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,070
他们的死对头 M3青年军 每次都被抓
Their rivals, the M3 Colts, get nailed every time.

469
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,080
他们每次拿到毒品
Part of what they seize,

470
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,670
就拿一部分去街上二次售卖
they re-sell on the streets.

471
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,340
其他的屯起来
The rest goes into lock up.

472
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,410
那真是一大笔钱啊
That's a lot of drug money.

473
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:47,950
耶茨怎么样? 他很不开心
So what about Yates? He's unhappy.

474
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,350
他马上就要离开反黑组了
He's already leaving the unit.

475
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,960
也许是让他帮我们的好机会
Could mean he's ready to flip.

476
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,480
我们得跟他取得联系
We need to reach out to him.

477
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,450
罗素死死盯着我  我没法接近耶茨
Russell's all over me. I can't get near Yates.

478
00:22:56,490 --> 00:23:00,000
那我呢?
What if I can?

479
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,230
听着 这里才是我的行动组 不是反黑组
Look, this is my unit, not SMASH.

480
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,900
我们动手吧
Let's do this.

481
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,670
我还以为只有女孩才抽这种烟
I thought only girls smoked those.

482
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,510
你嫉妒我 因为我抽的很爽
You're just jealous 'cause I make these look good.

483
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,910
你就自欺欺人吧 最近怎么样?
Yeah you keep telling yourself that. What's going on?

484
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:25,320
看见杰西没? 我联系不到他
You seen Jesse? I tried calling him.

485
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:29,000
他跟罗素一起 我们很快就要分队了
He's with Russell, we got squad soon.

486
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:37,730
你应该少喝点 马上就要当班了
No. You should go easy, you got shift soon.

487
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:41,360
少来啦
Takes the edge off.

488
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,030
听说你快退休了
I heard you were retiring man.

489
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:45,630
我还记得当年你为这个组奋不顾身的时候
I remember when this unit meant everything to you.

490
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:47,600
你不也是这样
Used to mean something to you too.

491
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,010
离开没那么容易 相信我
It wasn't easy walking away. Trust me.

492
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:53,940
做事张狂 为了干掉一些混蛋惹了一堆人
Going a little too far, kicking some ass to get the bad guy.

493
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:56,950
现在不是这样了
It's not like that anymore.

494
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:59,780
我们已经越界了 丹尼
We crossed over, Danny.

495
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,680
一切都不能回头了
I should've done it back then.

496
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,150
就像你一样 划清了界限
Just like you. Drawn my line in the sand.

497
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,390
你现在就可以啊
You can do that now.

498
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,960
你以为我为什么要离开?
Why do you think I'm getting out?

499
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:12,000
你要是关心那个杰西 就快把他弄出来
You care about that kid Jesse, you'll get him out too.

500
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:14,640
嘿耶茨 发生什么事了吗
Hey Yates, is there something going on?

501
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:18,300
你跟罗斯之间是不是有什么问题
Is there something happening between you and Russ?

502
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:25,370
罗素 老地方见

503
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:27,310
是罗素
It's Russell.

504
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,710
我要走了
I gotta go.

505
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,980
等会等会 再呆一分钟
Hold on, hold on. Just a second.

506
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:34,050
到底怎么了
What's going on?

507
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,580
到底有什么事?
Is there something I need to know?

508
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:40,790
你好好看着杰西 好吧?
You keep an eye on Jesse, alright?

509
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,200
杰西 怎么了?
Jesse, what's happening?

510
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:53,070
M3青年军有个藏毒地点 罗素有线索
M3 Colts have a stash house. Russell got a tip.

511
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,990
他想在他们听到风声挪货之前 
He wants to do a takedown now,

512
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:55,940
将他们一网打尽
 before they catch wind and move the product.

513
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:58,230
好的 你盯着那批货 
Alright you keep an eye on the drugs.

514
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:01,170
我通知丽贝卡 你告诉我地点
I'll call Rebecca. You gimme that location.

515
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:17,120
从前门进 这次我们一起行动
Front door. We stay together on this one.

516
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,560
你俩殿后 我跟耶茨带路
You two hang back, Yates and I will take the lead.

517
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:23,600
他们要进屋了
They're going in.

518
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,010
耶茨 上楼 快
Yates, upstairs, let's go.

519
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:42,080
杰西 走吧 
Jesse, let's go! Come on.

520
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,020
别跟个缩头乌龟似的
Get your head out of your ass.

521
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:45,880
杰西在拖延时间 事情不对劲
Jesse's stalling, something's up.

522
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:07,810
耶茨!
Yates!

523
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,140
慢点 慢点
Easy, easy.

524
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:31,260
这他妈的怎么回事?
What the hell is going on?

525
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,730
他开枪打中了耶茨
He shot Yates.

526
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,760
波顿警官 你要跟我走一趟
Officer Borden. You need to come with me.

527
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:11,330
我对今天发生的事 有些疑问
I've got questions about what happened today.

528
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,200
我们得把他弄出来
We gotta get him out of there.

529
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:15,900
待在车里别动 我不想暴露他的身份
Stay in the car. I don't want to burn him.

530
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:17,230
我来处理这事
I've got this.

531
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,900
我申请保护杰西
I want Jesse protected.

532
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:25,130
- 答应我你们会保护他 -丽贝卡.
- Tell me you'll take care of him. - Rebecca.

533
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,990
如果查出他是警察伪装的卧底
If it gets out that he went undercover on cops,

534
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:29,190
那他这辈子都完了
it will chase him for the rest of his career.

535
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,580
你以为你在跟谁说话
Who the hell do you think you're talking to?

536
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,490
要么他能毫发无伤的离开这儿
Either he walks away from this unscathed,

537
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:35,190
不然我会让每个警员都知道
or I will personally make sure that everyone on this force knows

538
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:37,970
耶茨警员的死因是因为你不支持我
that the reason Detective Yates died is because you wouldn't back me.

539
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:40,530
你会因为这个下台 而不是我
You'll be going down for this, not me.

540
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:56,670
等的花都快谢了
It's been forever.

541
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:58,940
你觉得他在里面干嘛
How do you think he's doing in there?

542
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,340
先看看吧 他来了
We'll see. Here he comes now.

543
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,230
我觉得是罗素杀了他
I think Russell killed him.

544
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:19,500
他杀了耶茨然后把枪塞到
I think he shot Yates and planted the gun

545
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:23,030
在场的那个孩子手里栽赃他
 on that kid at the scene.

546
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:25,930
他进屋搜查的方式
It was the way he was moving around in that room.

547
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,740
还有他脸上的表情
It was the way he looked.

548
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:29,800
你告诉他们这些了吗?
Did you tell them that?

549
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,910
没有 我不能指控别的警官
No, I can't just accuse another cop.

550
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:35,780
杰西 看着我
Jesse, look at me.

551
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:38,110
你必须确定
You gotta be sure.

552
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:42,680
是他干的 我确定
He did it. I'm sure.

553
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:49,120
耶茨想出来
Yates wanted out.

554
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,590
他要离开行动组
He was leaving the unit.

555
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:53,360
罗素觉得他要告发他们 我确信是这样
Russell thought he was gonna blow the whistle on them. I sure of it.

556
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,400
我们得马上重新取得卡尔弗特警官的证词
We'll retake Officer Calvert's statement immediately,

557
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:56,800
然后从那开始
and go from there.

558
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:59,310
你要很谨慎 你得抹掉他的名字
You're going to be discreet, you're going to take his name out of this.

559
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:01,030
你也知道的 这不可能
Come on, that's not going to happen.

560
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:02,580
他会死的很惨
He'll be crucified.

561
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,070
一个警察被指控谋杀另一个警察丽贝卡
A cop has been accused of murdering another cop, Rebecca.

562
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:07,540
这简直就是大丑闻
There's no way this doesn't get ugly.

563
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,190
哈里森教育巡查员
Staff Inspector Harrison...

564
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:12,790
无权处理 这案子归内务部调查丽贝卡
Has no authority here, this is IA's investigation, Rebecca.

565
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:14,880
不管杰西有没有看见
Either Jesse saw it or he didn't.

566
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,220
我都需要他的证词
I want his statement.

567
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,360
我们需要证据
We need proof.

568
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:25,930
我不会让杰西一人承担这事
I'm not putting Jesse out there on his own.

569
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,360
好的 那我们暗中支持
Alright, then we stay under.

570
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:30,360
在罗素听到风声之前 我们先拿下他 
We get to Russell first, before he feels the heat.

571
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,980
丽贝卡让所有人都去简报室
Rebecca wants everybody in the briefing room.

572
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:46,450
让她等等
She can wait.

573
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,380
耶茨是我的朋友
Yates was a friend of mine.

574
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,550
这不可能
There's no way.

575
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:56,050
罗素会做很多事 但他不可能做这件事
Russell is capable of a lot of things, but not that.

576
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:57,590
我知道我看见了什么
I know what I saw.

577
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:00,230
那你看到的就是错的
Then you saw wrong.

578
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,930
我告诉她你马上来
I'll tell her you're coming.

579
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,530
突袭行动当中 突然有人开枪 情况复杂
Middle of a raid, gunshots, things get foggy.

580
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:13,470
很难说你到底看到了什么  杰西
It's hard to know what exactly you saw, Jesse.

581
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:15,010
也许你是一叶障目
Maybe you've got tunnel vision.

582
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,340
这对你们来说很难接受 我懂
This is hard for you, I get that.

583
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,860
但如果杰西是对的 他就需要支援
But if Jesse's right, he needs backup.

584
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:21,870
他同样需要证据 他是这儿唯一有危险的人
He also needs proof. He's the one on the line here.

585
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:24,550
耶茨马上就要退休了
Yates was about to retire from the unit.

586
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,680
罗素担心他会告密
Russell was paranoid he was going to talk.

587
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,190
那我们就利用他的担心
Let's use that paranoia.

588
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,020
可能是我们最好的切入点
Could be our best way in.

589
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:33,160
丹尼尔你最了解罗素 你说该怎么做
Daniel, you know Russell the best. You tell us.

590
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:40,160
如果这事是真的
Look, if this is true,

591
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,900
或许杰西可以给他打电话
maybe Jesse can call him,

592
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:43,700
说他不想干了
tell him he wants out of the unit.

593
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:46,200
我们要让罗素感觉他失去控制权了
We need to make Russell feel like he's losing control.

594
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,140
他会担心杰西在突袭时看到了什么
He'll be worried what Jesse saw at the raid.

595
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:48,980
然后会想见他
 He'll want to come see him.

596
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,910
好的杰西 你跟他谈 要坦诚
Okay Jesse, you talk to him, you got to open up.

597
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:54,340
告诉他你在房子里看到的情景让你很害怕
Tell him you're freaking out about what you saw in the house.

598
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,680
你必须要让他说 明白吗
You got to get him to talk, alright?

599
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,150
嘿
Hey.

600
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,790
你没事吧
You okay?

601
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,720
我没事
Yeah. I'm good.

602
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:10,360
那好 我们开工吧
Alright let's get to work.

603
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,830
你紧张吗
You nervous?

604
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:19,400
是啊
Yeah.

605
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,030
我也是
Me too.

606
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:30,310
再让我听听音频
Let me hear the audio again.

607
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:33,050
能说点什么吗? 我们好调音量
Can you say something? Give us a level.

608
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,880
罗素我一直在想
Russell, I've been thinking.

609
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:38,120
我想了好久 这工作并不适合我
I've been thinking it over, and it's not for me.

610
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:40,020
- 很好 - 好了 准备就绪
- That's good  - we're good. We're ready.

611
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:45,360
杰西
Jesse...

612
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:50,230
你能办好这事 知道吗?　你做得到
You' got this, okay? You can do it.

613
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:58,720
注意了
Heads up.

614
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:20,860
杰西　他们在门外了
Okay Jesse, they're coming to the door.

615
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,110
你一个人吗
You alone?

616
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,440
是啊
Yeah.

617
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:46,000
我知道发生那件事　很难受
I know what happened was tough, alright?

618
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:49,760
但这并不意味着你需要离开反黑组
But it doesn't mean you need to leave the unit.

619
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:54,460
我一直在想反黑组　想你们做的事
I been thinking about SMASH, what you guys do.

620
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:56,030
不太适合我
It's just not for me.

621
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,000
我们做的事?
What we do?

622
00:32:57,030 --> 00:33:00,300
庞兹　他说我们做的事是什么意思?
Pounds, what's that mean, "What we do"?

623
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:04,070
真难倒我了　啥意思　小滑头
Beats me. What's that mean, Slick?

624
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,810
让我们把这事捋捋
So let me get this straight.

625
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,810
你想离开
You want to leave.

626
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:14,150
听着 杰西　我绝不会让这事发生 
Look, Jesse, I can't let that happen.

627
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:15,350
不可能
Nope.

628
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:18,420
绝不可能　小Ｊ
No can do, J-bird.

629
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:21,950
罗素太偏执了　他不会好好谈的
Russell's too paranoid, he's not going to talk.

630
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:23,910
如果你真要离开　
If you do leave,

631
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:27,530
我们别无选择　只好告诉大家真相
we have no chance but to tell everyone the truth.

632
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,960
真相
Truth?

633
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,660
关于你的真相
Truth about you.

634
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:36,230
我们今早去见了安德烈
See, we paid Andre a visit this morning.

635
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:39,600
关于那晚发生的事情　他记得很清楚
Turns out he remembers this night pretty clearly.

636
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:44,040
主要是你　你一脚踹开他家前门
Mostly you, you kicking in his front door,

637
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,310
在他面前挥舞着枪
waving a gun in his face.

638
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:49,010
没错　他记得很清楚
Yeah, he remembers that real clear.

639
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:52,480
我只是做了你们让我做的事
I was just doing what you guys told me to do.

640
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:55,620
我从没告诉你去恐吓别人
I never told you to intimidate anyone.

641
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:58,220
毁坏他的东西　我没告诉你这么做吧
Destroy his possessions. I didn't tell you that, did I?

642
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:01,830
那是严重的＂徽章综合症＂　你完全失控了
That's heavy badge syndrome. You couldn't be controlled.

643
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:07,430
罗素只是想给你个机会 　但你搞砸了
Russell was trying to give you a shot and you …you blew it.

644
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:10,100
事实上 我们跟你工作的这段时间
Fact is, the whole time we worked with you,

645
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:13,000
你都是闯入民宅 栽赃毒品
you were breaking into houses, planting drugs,

646
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,640
伪造报告
falsifying reports.

647
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:17,340
你的做法麻烦大了
Total behaviour problem.

648
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:20,910
现在 知道你打哪来的 一切都说得通了
Now, kinda makes sense, given where you came from.

649
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:23,610
我们看了你的档案 孩子 你在南部长大
Read your file, kid, you grew up in Southside.

650
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:26,120
一个孤独的渴望归属感的孩子 不是吗 
Just another lonely kid looking to belong, right?

651
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:26,950
唯一的问题是
 The only problem is

652
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,320
你只是一个祸害
you're nothing but trouble.

653
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:30,990
我真心希望你厌倦了做警察 杰西
I sure hope you're tired of being a cop, Jesse.

654
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:33,920
因为你完蛋了
Because you are done.

655
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,590
他在说什么
What's he talking about?

656
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:37,730
罗素不会透露任何信息
Russell's not going to give us anything.

657
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,410
他想要摧毁杰西的公信度
He's going to try to destroy Jesse's credibility.

658
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:40,750
那不可能站得住脚
That'll never stand up.

659
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:43,180
是吗? 看上去他好像把每个人都摸透了
Really? Look he's got the neighborhood under his thumb,

660
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,180
他们会替罗素出庭作证
they'll vouch for Russell.

661
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,670
他要干嘛
What's he doing?

662
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,740
丹尼尔 丹尼尔!
Daniel. Daniel!

663
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,910
他要进去了
He's going inside.

664
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,180
他在想什么?
What is he thinking?

665
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:06,320
不知道
I don't know.

666
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,530
你想干什么?
What are you doing?

667
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,650
我原本信任你的 你怎么能这样
I trusted you. How could you do this?

668
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,300
我们赶紧离开这吧 快点
Let's get the hell out of here man, we gotta go.

669
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,560
丹尼 发生什么了?
Danny. What the hell man?

670
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,080
跟我讲讲发生了什么
You going to tell me what's going on?

671
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,970
听我说 相信我 我们快点离开这
Listen to me. Just trust me, we gotta get out of here.

672
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:22,660
除非你告诉我发生了什么 
No one goes anywhere until you tell me what's going on.

673
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:29,230
听着 我的这个哥们
Listen, I got a buddy,alright.

674
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:33,260
他一直监视着你们 然后通知了我
He's got his ear to the ground, and he gave me a call.

675
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:39,440
内务部 这小子是卧底 他是来调查你的
IA, the kid's on the job, he's working you.

676
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,940
听着 对不起 我搞砸了
Look, I'm sorry, I screwed up.

677
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,090
如果我知道他会这样
I would've never brought him near you,

678
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:44,580
我就不会把他带来你这边
if I knew.

679
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:48,750
怎么了罗素 你搞得我有点紧张
Yo, Russell, what's up, you're making me nervous over here.

680
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:51,020
这小子在调查我们
The kid's working us.

681
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,850
冷静点 哥们
Hey, come on man, calm down.

682
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:55,620
检查一下 我们被监视了
Check the place, it's wired.

683
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:00,990
在哪
Where is it?

684
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:02,430
在哪?
Where is it?

685
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,460
我不知道
I don't know.

686
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,620
罗素.
Russell.

687
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,370
你这狗娘养的
You little bitch.

688
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:19,610
我完了 丹尼
I'm screwed, Danny.

689
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:21,310
冷静点
Okay.

690
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:23,900
要是这小子看见你做了些出格的事情
So, what if the kid saw you get a little out of line.

691
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:26,600
你们也都知道我们会这么做 这是我们的工作
Everyone knows that's what we do, that's part of the job.

692
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,950
罗素 我们还等什么 快点走
Russell, what are we doing man; we should get out of here.

693
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,810
闭上你的嘴 别打扰我!
Shut up and let me think!

694
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:36,930
我得想一想 我得想一想
I just need to think. I just need to think.

695
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,370
你
You.

696
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,570
是你把这小子介绍来了
You introduced this kid to me.

697
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,150
罗素 我是来找你帮你摆平这事的
Russ, I came to find you, I came to make this go away.

698
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:48,860
我怎么知道你就不是来调查我的?
How do I know you're not wired?

699
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:49,990
得了吧
Russ. Come on!

700
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:51,510
巴蒂那伙人
The Bardi crew.

701
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,380
你还记得吗 八年前的事情
Eight years ago, you remember that?

702
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:54,850
我们办的那件大案子?
That big takedown we did?

703
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,010
还记得那个狂妄的家伙吗
Remember that guy that was mouthing off too much?

704
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:59,450
科斯塔・桑切斯.
Costa Sanchez.

705
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,480
你当时把他痛打了一顿 罗斯
You beat him up pretty bad, Russ.

706
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:05,120
他不久就死在了医院里
He ended up dying in hospital later.

707
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:10,490
但我没有上报这事
I didn't report that.

708
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:12,630
我保护了你
I protected you.

709
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:16,100
我们在录像 他不知道吗?
We're recording this. Does he know that?

710
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:17,970
丹尼尔到底想干嘛?
What the hell are you doing Daniel?

711
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,470
如果我这边在监听你们 我会说这些吗
And if I was wearing a wire would I say all of this?

712
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:24,470
我和你一样都有罪
I'm just as guilty as you.

713
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:29,780
罗斯 我们是兄弟 我以前就挺你
Russ, come on we're brothers, man. I had your back then.

714
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:31,680
现在不也是一样吗
Don't I have it now?

715
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:34,640
但你必须告诉我到底发生了什么
But you gotta talk to me, you gotta tell me what's going on Russell.

716
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,850
你干了什么?
What did you do?

717
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:39,420
罗斯 这到底怎么回事?
Russ, what the hell is going on?

718
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:42,560
- 我欠了很多债 - 钱?
- I'm in a lot of debt man. - Money?

719
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:44,830
所以你收了些不该收的钱?
So, you took some money you shouldn't have, man.

720
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,780
还有吗 我们都受过诱惑 还有别的吗
What else? We all get tempted. What else?

721
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:50,430
这里被监听了 罗素!
This place is wired. Russell!

722
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:53,400
现在无所谓了
It doesn't matter, not anymore.

723
00:37:57,110 --> 00:38:00,570
他要泄密
He was going to squeal.

724
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:04,850
他会把我们全毁了的
He was going to hurt us. All of us.

725
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,180
我不得不让他消失 丹尼尔
Daniel, I needed him gone.

726
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:07,920
罗素!
Russell!

727
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:10,520
闭嘴
Shut up!

728
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:16,060
你说的是耶茨吗 罗素
Are you talking about Yates, Russell?

729
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:19,060
你开枪打了耶茨?
Russell, did you shoot Yates?

730
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:23,630
他说他不会就这样算了的
He told me he wasn't gonna let it go.

731
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:27,200
为了大家 我不得不这么做
I had to, for us, didn't I?

732
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,100
我心里真的很难受 丹尼尔
Daniel, I am in so deep man.

733
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:35,780
早知我就不该保护你
I shouldn't have protected you back then.

734
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:38,050
我打算逮捕你
I'm taking you in.

735
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:43,720
你难道觉得你就是个好人了?
You think you're better than me, is that it?

736
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,050
你也会这么做的
You would have done the same thing.

737
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:48,390
我们都一样
We are the same.

738
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:51,920
我们不一样
We're not the same.

739
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,160
现在不是
Not now.

740
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,970
以后也不是
Not ever.

741
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,370
嘿!
Hey.

742
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,540
丹尼尔怎么样
What happened with Daniel?

743
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:43,340
丹尼尔 在他在反黑组时还是个菜鸟
Daniel was a rookie cop when he was with SMASH.

744
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:46,240
太害怕了 不敢违抗他们的意思
A kid too scared to go against the force.

745
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:50,520
我对督察长这么为他辩护的
That was my argument, to the Chief Inspector.

746
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:53,520
好吧
Okay.

747
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:54,850
他相信了吗
And he bought it?

748
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:05,730
原本可能不会这样的
That could have gone a different way.

749
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,830
我有可能错了
I could've been wrong.

750
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:13,040
你们都和我一起插手这事情
You guys all followed me in,

751
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:16,170
而我并不一定是正确的
and I could've been wrong.

752
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:20,680
但你是没错
Yeah, but you weren't.

753
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,790
听着丽贝卡
Look, Rebecca,

754
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,490
你今天做的这些
what you did today.

755
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:35,390
得罪了警长 内务部 你把团队放在第一位
Taking on the brass. IA. You put your team first.

756
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:40,460
我没见过别的警察能做到这点
No other cop I know would have been able to do that.

757
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,600
只有你
No other cop,

758
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:47,370
有这样的勇气
would've had the strength.

759
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:26,840
罗素跟我说了有关街区里的事情
Russell said this thing to me.

760
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,840
我们所做的事情...
About the streets, what we do...

761
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:33,050
以及如何去打一场不可能胜利的战争
How we're fighting a war that we can never win.

762
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:37,020
你觉得他说的对吗
You think he's right?

763
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:39,520
那这一切又是为了什么?
So what's the point of all this, then?

764
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:44,390
不是街上的战争 是内心的战争
The war's not out there, it's in here.

765
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:48,460
你想不想继续战斗下去取决于你自己
Up to you how long you want to fight.

766
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:52,570
今天你干的不错
Good job today.

767
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,770
嘿
Hey.

768
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,710
你们怎么来了 来这干吗?
What's this, what are you guys doing?

769
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:03,180
来请我的朋友泰瑞喝一杯 你不来吗
Buying my friend Terri a drink, thought you might want to join us?

770
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:06,350
你还好吧?
You okay?

771
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:08,150
好吧 我要去...
Alright, I'm going to get a...

772
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,820
是的 很好
Yeah.

773
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:14,490
嘿 老大
Hey, Coach.

774
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:17,490
我想我可能用得上那段废话了
I think I can use that pep talk now.

775
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:20,560
你今天这样看起来还不错
You seemed to be doing fine on your own today.

776
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:24,630
不过我还是想跟你说一句 你不欠他什么
But, if I was, I'd tell you, you don't owe him anything, Daniel.

777
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:26,270
懂吗
You know that, right?

778
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,850
把我带成今天这么一个警察的人吗
Guy made me the cop I am today.

779
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:32,210
不 你是凭你自己变成这么一个警察的
No. You made the cop that you are today.

780
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,980
当然还有我们帮了点忙
With a little help from us.

781
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:38,630
怎么了
What?

782
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:39,650
谢谢
Thanks, man.

783
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,650
没事
No problem.

784
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,050
- 能来杯酒啤酒吗 - 当然
- Hey can I get a beer? - Sure.

785
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:50,860
那么
So.

786
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:54,030
现在说还是等会说
Do you want to talk about it now or later?

787
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:56,930
等会吧
Later. Okay?

788
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,300
我在这等你
I'm not going anywhere.
