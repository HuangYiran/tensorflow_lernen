{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}drive around in circles
for hours on end?

104
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:18,234
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. It is not "in" you.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nature. Mother Nature.

107
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,399
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe you've heard of her?

108
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:26,705
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We all have our limitations, Theo.

109
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:31,874
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the sooner you accept the dull,
miserable reality of your existence,

110
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:34,246
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the happier you'll be.

111
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:38,419
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow. Aren't you
just a little ray of sunshine?

00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:43,528
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Heads up! Shell crusher, two o' clock!

113
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,393
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, people, you know the drill.

114
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:53,061
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tuck and roll!

00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:58,468
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can't tuck. I can't tuck!

116
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:04,546
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Theo, tuck and roll!

117
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,309
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've been over this.
I don't tuck and roll.

118
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,955
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have a shell for a reason.
Use it.

119
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:10,452
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You use it.

00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:40,843
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Adrenalode, not legal in
Utah and South Dakota.

133
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,988
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do not exceed more than two cans

00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:57,092
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm here with five-time Indy champ,
the legendary Guy Gagné!

139

00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:00,236
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell us, Guy, do you have any advice
for the future racers out there

141
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:01,707
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}who might be watching at home right now?

00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,364
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my gosh. That's me, that's me.

00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,978
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, there comes a time
in every race

144
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:10,673
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when a driver is forced to make
that one, key, split-second decision.

145
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fall behind, or push ahead.

146
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:14,278
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Push ahead!

00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:19,823
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To take a chance and risk it all,
or play it safe and suffer defeat.

148
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:21,153
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Risk it all, Guy!

149
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:23,887
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But what really separates
the racers from the champions...

150
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:24,987
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes!

151
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:29,862
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...that one thing that separates
the ordinary from the extra ordinary...

152
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:31,231
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is it?

153
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:34,332
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That one thing is...

154

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:45,416
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! No! No! No! No!

157
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come back to me, TV!

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-'Morning, Bob.
-'Morning, Sally.

00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:17,640

00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,218
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, this is good.

163
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:24,447
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, this is good.

00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,956
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I daresay we've had
a breakthrough, here.

165
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:30,721
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With that TV gone,
you can finally get out of that garage

166
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:34,355
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and put all that racing nonsense
behind you.

167
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:35,694
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And do what?

168
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:37,427
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Start living your life.

169
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:38,798
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have a life?

170
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:42,263
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Big Red?

00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:48,478
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't tuck. I can't tuck!

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes!
.Finally!

00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,949
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, let's chow down!

00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:58,621
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hit the brakes, people.

176

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's Gardener Day.

177
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,159
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're quitting? Just like that?

00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a bad thing.

180

00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:41,933
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just step away from the grass
and get back to work.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gentlemen, start your engines.

00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:59,179
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And once again, it's Turbo out front.

190
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:05,647
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No dream is too big.

00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:26,835
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And it looks like the winner is...

00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:03,943
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You could've gotten yourself killed!

197

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Theo, what were you thinking?

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wish...

00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:26,722
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was close.

203
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:47,203
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no! Come on! Faster!

206
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:38,656
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no!

207
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,366
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happened?

208
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:24,142
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, hey, hey!
Get out of here!

209
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:26,209
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not dead! Not dead!

210
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:39,722
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It reeks in here.

211
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:43,485
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's like wearing a hat
made out of feet.

212
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,297
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Home.

213
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:06,818
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right.

214
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:08,547
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm okay.

215
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:16,352
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's peculiar.

216
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,329
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, what's happening to me?

217
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:30,235
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? That's me!

218
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,673
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on! Stop it!

219
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:35,373
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Quiet, quiet!

220
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:38,881
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

221
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:47,617
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Welcome, everyone,
to this monthly safety meeting.

222
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:51,961
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, there goes Jerry.

223
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:54,726
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going to
hand things over to Chet, now,

224
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,097
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}who has some important
new policies to go over.

225
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:01,763
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you very much, Carl.
Good afternoon, everyone.

226
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:06,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm happy to "poli-see"
you all here today.

227
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:13,776
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. I would like to begin
with some very exciting news.

228
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:15,386
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The latest figures are in.

229
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:18,751
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Accidental smushes
were down 15 percent.

230
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:20,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well done, team.

231
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:36,099
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yo, yo! You're listening to 98.6
where hip-hop... beats.

232
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:05,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Finally.

233
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:12,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Huh?

234
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:16,544
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What in the...

235
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:21,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Help!

236
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,112
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop! stop, stop!

237
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:26,614
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom!

238
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,148
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah!

239
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:33,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no!

240
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:37,227
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And so, in preparation for
Crow Awareness Week,

241
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:39,228
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd just like to say...

242
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:41,726
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tuck and roll!

243
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:45,562
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I'm not kidding! Tuck and roll!

244
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:48,262
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look out!

245
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,176
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Granted, yes,

246
00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:02,981
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I admit that there's been
a wee bit of damage to inventory, here,

247
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,589
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but if you'd just let me explain...

248
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:05,848
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're fired!

249
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:09,289
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa, okay, Carl,
if you just give him one more chance,

250
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:11,691
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I promise that this will never, ever...

251
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:14,662
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't understand.
You're fired.

252
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:19,737
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"You," plural.
Youse. Y'all. Both of you!

253
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:30,643
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chet. I'm so sorry.

254
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,411
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have to believe me,
I didn't mean for this to...

255
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:35,849
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All my life.

256
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:41,221
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All my life,
I've defended you, covered for you,

257
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:46,388
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}stood up for you, apologized for you,
and this is what I get in return.

258
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:49,591
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dragged down with you
on your sinking ship.

259
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:53,363
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A nice, comfy deck chair
on the 5.5'. Thea!

260
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,165
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aye-aye, Captain!

261
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,264
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm really sorry.

262
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:58,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is wrong with you?

263
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:00,439
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know.
All I know is, the other night,

264
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:02,842
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm standing above the 101,
and all of a sudden...

265
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:04,914
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was a rhetorical question!

266
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:07,142
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chet!

267
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Help! The world is moving!

268
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:27,629
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Coming through!

269
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,709
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, I'm gonna wake up any minute now.

270
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,109
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wake up! Wake up!

271
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:49,283
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chet?

272
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:09,413
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Easy now, fellas.
You really don't wanna do this.

273
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,115
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chet!

274
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:45,879
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Am I dead? Is this heaven?

275
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:48,213
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I pictured it cleaner.

276
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:49,683
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, get up.

277
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:53,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Theo. The crows got you, too.

278
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:57,222
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? No, Chet, it wasn't the crows.
It was...

279
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,355
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at this place.

280
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:03,331
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Broken glass, rusty nails.
-Breathe.

281
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,766
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Discarded salt packets!
-A few, yeah.

282
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:08,133
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's like a minefield out here.

283
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,269
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no.
I've got tetanus. I've got tetanus.

284
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:15,004
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My jaw is locking up.

285
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:19,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chet, will you calm down?
There is no reason to panic.

286
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:23,317
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everything's gonna be just fine.

287
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:28,959
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, well, well.
Buenas noches, little amigos.

288
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:31,723
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This must be my lucky day.

289
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hula.It's Tito.

290
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:41,065
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, tell everyone I'm bringing it.

291
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:17,104
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is this place?

292
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:24,539
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, well, well.

293
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:28,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Somebody better call the cops,
because I'm about to make a killing.

294
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:29,745
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Killing?

295
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,288
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What'd he drag in this time?

296
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:36,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whiplash is going to eat them up.

297
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:38,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's gonna be a slaughter.

298
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,596
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mm-hmm, dead meat.

299
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:43,467
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're gonna die. We're gonna die.

300
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:51,871
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, come on. Now, hurry up.

301
00:26:57,716 --> 00:27:01,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A little far from home aren't you,
garden snail?

302
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:05,118
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, I think we got a crier here.

303
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,258
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's do this!

304
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:09,655
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got this one! Oh, I got this one!

305
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:10,786
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Yeah, yeah!

306
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:11,919
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on! This is me!

307
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:13,792
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Time to go, Theo.

308
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:15,657

310
00:27:23,508 --> 00:27:24,532
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go!

311
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:38,078
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look. He dead.

312
00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:40,555
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Taco Man found dead snail.

313
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:48,322
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

314
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:17,458
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Run!

316
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:26,433
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did you say your name was again?

317
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:29,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My name is Turbo.

318
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:31,469
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wish I could rename myself.

319
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:32,635
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where did you find him?

320
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:33,701
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How did he do that?

321
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:34,768
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where did you come from?

322
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:36,644
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, how'd you do that?

323
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:38,214
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Theo. A word, please.

324
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,476
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, that was...

325
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:41,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Amazing, right?

326
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you think that's something,
check this out.

327
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:44,946
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Turn it off!

328
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:47,321
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry. High beams. Sorry.

329
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:49,051
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a new one.

330
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:52,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's okay, it's okay, Theo.
Just hang in there.

331
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:54,831
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As soon as we get home,
we're gonna get you fixed.

332
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:57,127
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? I don't need to be fixed.

333
00:28:57,302 --> 00:28:58,326
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's nothing wrong with me, Chet.

334
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:02,064
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing wrong with you? Well, you're...

335
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,571
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're a freak of nature.

336
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know, I know! isn't it great?

337
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:06,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Theo!

338
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:08,646
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what? I prefer "Turbo."

339
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:12,709
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know
what crazy lab you escaped from

340
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:16,514
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but you're amazing, Little Amigo.
Amazing!

341

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tito!

342

343
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:24,062
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you see that sign? What does it say?

344
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:25,452
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Angelo...

345
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,931
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It says, "Dos Bros Tacos."

346
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Dos "Bros, Tito.
Not "Uno"Bro.

347
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:33,596
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're supposed to be out there,
selling tacos,

348
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,035
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}not racing snails.

349
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:37,675
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know, but this little guy
is something special.

350
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:39,037
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm telling you, Angelo,

351
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:42,077
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the customers are gonna be lining up
around the block.

352
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:43,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can see it already.

353
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:48,919
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Come for the snail racing,
stay for the chimichangas."

354
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:54,889
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get your head out of the clouds, Tito.
it's enough with your crazy schemes.

355
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:57,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! You're a taco genius, Angelo.

356
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:02,226
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And it is my mission in life
to share your gift with the world.

357
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:05,029
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great.
Then first thing in the morning,

358
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:09,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}get in that truck
and go sell some tacos.

359
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:12,334
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tito.

360
00:30:19,684 --> 00:30:22,176
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You sure you had enough to eat?
Are you tired?

361
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:25,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here, I made up your bed.

362
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:29,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, it might get
a little chilly tonight.

363
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:31,128
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, I warmed up your blanket.

364
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:36,297
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There you go. All comfy and cozy.

365
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:41,262
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sweet dreams, Little Amigo.
I'll see you in the morning.

366
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:45,502
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did he really just kiss you goodnight?

367
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,611
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He did. Jealous?

368
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:54,078
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Question.
What gives with the super-speed?

369
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:55,617
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey. hey, you a robot?

370
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:56,948
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you radioactive, homie?

371
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:58,213
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is it contagious?

372
00:30:58,323 --> 00:31:00,451
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give the kid some space.

373
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:05,029
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm Whiplash. And this here is my crew.

374
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,756
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm Skidmark!

375
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,032
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah. yeah!

376
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:14,661
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I'm Burn. Sizzle, sizzle, uh-uh.

377
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:17,809
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The name is Smoove Move.
I set the tone around here, you dig?

378
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:19,375
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now check this. Right about now,

379
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:23,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm moving so fast, the whole world's
going in slow motion, baby.

380
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:28,018
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here one second, gone the next.

381
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:30,211
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They call me the White Shadow!

382
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:34,188
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because I'm so fast,
all you see is my shadow.

383
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:36,118
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't get it.

384
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:38,956
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm fast, like a shadow!

385
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:42,556
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, but shadows,
they're not inherently fast.

386
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:45,466
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}White Shadow...

387
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:46,661
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can still see you.

388
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:50,504
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, garden snail, you clearly
got the skills to pay the bills.

389
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:53,243
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If snails had to pay bills, that is.

390
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:54,901
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You would be able to pay them.

391
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,547
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, bills.

392
00:31:56,714 --> 00:31:58,113
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Paid in full, son.

393
00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:01,913
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, I'm here to invite you
to join our crew.

394
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,616
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Join your crew?

395
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:07,552
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did I say something humorous?

396
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:10,592
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.
it's just that you guys are, you know,

397
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:13,129
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}kind of slow-ish.

398
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:15,099
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really? To our faces?

399
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,098
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Theo, what are you doing?

400
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:21,865
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear
what I clearly just heard.

401
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,372
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Heard what? I didn't hear anything.

402
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:26,237
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing out of order, did you, Theo?

403
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:27,435
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I meant what I said.

404
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:29,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then you better put your money
where your mouth is.

405
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:31,246
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Snails don't have money.

406
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:34,249
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Otherwise, we'd be able to
pay the bills. Remember?

407
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:36,547
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your trash talk
is needlessly complicated.

408
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:41,249
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is it? Or is it that your unpaid bills
are overdue?

409
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:45,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Enough talk. it's time for action.

410
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:50,098
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's simple. First one to the top
of that shooting star

411
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:52,662
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}wins.

412
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:56,034
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You guys? Way up there, huh? Awesome.

413
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:58,107
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me get my calendar
so I can time you.

414
00:32:58,609 --> 00:32:59,974
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got jokes, rookie?

415
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:02,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Laugh it up, garden snail.

416
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:05,039
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}On your mark...

417
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:06,945
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get yourself set...

418
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:10,315
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Prepare to be White Shadowed!

419
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,015
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa!

420
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:16,884
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah!

421
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:20,553
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah! Bam!

422
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:22,957
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Coming through!

423
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:24,729
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Those guys are crazy!

424
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:26,631
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Those guys are awesome.

425
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,967
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey. player! The party up here!

426
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:38,706
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do I get up there?

427
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:55,828
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Later!

428
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:11,876
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Coming through!

429
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:13,875
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah!

430
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:18,914
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's "slow-ish" now, garden snail?

431
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:27,957
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Today, everything changes!

432
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:30,897
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tito, what are you doing?

433
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,969
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Planning a "taco-volution"!

434
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:36,801
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a little concept that I came up with.
When you combine the words...

435
00:34:36,974 --> 00:34:39,705
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Taco" and "revolution." I get it.

436
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:42,471
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But how is that supposed
to help us sell tacos?

437
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:46,982
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Patience, bro.
Taco-volutions don't happen in a day.

438
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,751
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And next up an our tour
is the L.A. River.

439
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,557
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Famous for its appearance...

440
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,903
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get! Get out!

441
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:17,772
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, Paz.
Can you throw that up here?

442
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:20,447
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Coming to getcha!
I'm coming to getcha!

443
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:21,608
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bye.

444
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:23,545
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey!

445
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:26,316
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Valley Hobby, this is Bobby,
how can I help you?

446
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:30,694
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, you got the wrong number.
Yeah, okay.

447
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:34,288
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what I'm talking about!

448
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:37,867
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want Jackson Five on your feet?
One Jackson per toe.

449
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:41,835
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sure, knock yourself out.

450
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can't get no better.

451
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:30,879
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. So, what's your plan?

452
00:36:31,055 --> 00:36:34,184
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stay herein this rundown strip mall?

453
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:36,727
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With a bunch of lunatic snails,

454
00:36:36,894 --> 00:36:41,559
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and a nut so taco man
who is using you to sell Mexican food?

455
00:36:41,732 --> 00:36:46,226
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because if that's your plan,
then whoopty-skippy-do, sign me up!

456
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:50,841
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My ears are burning.
I hope you're not talking about me.

457
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:54,374
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You two seem to have
a special connection, Little Amigo,

458
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:58,448
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and Snail Who Seems To Be
Friends With Little Amigo.

459
00:36:58,616 --> 00:36:59,708
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is this your mother?

460
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:02,112
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your sister?

461
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,954
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Say no more. it's your girlfriend.

462
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:12,062
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's a cutie.

463
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:20,194
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Women.

464
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,131
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have to admit,

465
00:37:23,307 --> 00:37:26,709
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was kind of hoping the taco-volution
would've started by now.

466
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,084
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It doesn't make sense.

467
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,721
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With my brains and your speed,

468
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:39,879
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we should be destined for greatness,
right?

469
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,916
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We need to think big,
Little Amigo.

470
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:47,122
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm talking commercials,
talk shows, county fairs.

471
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:51,291
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Flea markets.
No, farmers' markets. No, supermarkets.

472
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:53,401
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll cover all the markets.

473
00:37:54,805 --> 00:37:57,797
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Quinceañers,
confirmations, graduations.

474
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:00,643
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Indy 500.

475
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:04,372
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got it.
We can have our very own telenovela!

476
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:06,107
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? No.

477
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,901
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is it, Chet.
I knew we ended up here for a reason.

478
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:26,935
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will you just slow down for a second?

479
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:31,171
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Slow down? Are you kidding?
I'm never going slow again!

480
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:32,969
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Theo, stop.

481
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:36,478
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you trying to say?

482
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:39,014
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wanna enter him in the Indy 500.

483
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:41,811
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Indy 500?
What are you talking about?

484
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,249
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is he talking about?

485
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:45,981
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, look,
I know it may sound a little crazy...

486
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,683
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no, Tito,
that doesn't sound crazy.

487
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:52,487
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dos Bros Tacos and Sushi.
That was crazy.

488
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:54,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? People love sushi.

489
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:59,266
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dos Bros Tacos and Monkey Petting Zoo.
That was crazy.

490
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:01,804
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The babies were cute.
The adults were just so mean.

491
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:05,499
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Taco Man and his sidekick, the Churro.

492
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,872
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was off-the-hook crazy!

493
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:09,472
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Crazy awesome.

494
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:14,551
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But this, Tito?
This is in a category all by itself.

495
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:15,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Angelo, please.

496
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:18,044
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Chet. Just hear me out.

497
00:39:18,222 --> 00:39:22,022
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Theo, a snail cannot race
in a competition meant for cars.

498
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,661
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There are rules.

499
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:25,626
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Actually,
I've been doing a lot of research,

500
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:28,857
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and there's nothing in the rules
that says a snail can't enter the race.

501
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,661
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's nothing that says this sponge
can't enter the race either,

502
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:34,168
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but that doesn't mean
it's ever gonna happen.

503
00:39:34,338 --> 00:39:36,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Millions of people watch that race.

504
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:38,335
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This could put us on the map, bro.

505
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:41,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Trying to work, here.
-Come on, Angelo.

506
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:43,881
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All we have to do
is raise the $20,000 registration fee.

507
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:44,972
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

508
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:47,017
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I figured, once we sell the truck...
-Sell the...

509
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:49,482
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you even
listening to yourself, Tito?

510
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:54,819
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want to invest
our entire life savings in a snail!

511
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:58,428
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm telling you, this snail
crawled into our lives for a reason.

512
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:02,162
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think he could be
our little shooting star.

513
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,495
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you hear that, Chet?
This guy believes in me.

514
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:06,659
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That guy is as crazy as you are.

515
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:08,396
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They'll never let you into that race.

516
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:11,064
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And even if they did,
you wouldn't survive one lap.

517
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,607
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah, but...
-Angelo, listen...

518
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:13,767
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Tito!
-Theo!

519
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:16,536
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not every dream is meant to come true.

520
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:19,547
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, what he said.

521
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:25,049
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A snail in the Indy 500.

522
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:28,384
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What will you think of next?

523
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:40,463
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry, Little Amigo.
We'll get that entrance fee somehow.

524
00:40:47,144 --> 00:40:51,377
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, I know some people may say
$20,000 sounds like a lot of money.

525
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:52,641
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is a lot of money.

526
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:56,048
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I know some people
may say I'm crazy.

527
00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:00,589
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I say, when a snail crawls
into your life at 200 miles an hour,

528
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:03,386
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then you'd have to be crazy
not to grab onto that shell,

529
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:05,461
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and take a ride of a lifetime.

530
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:08,888
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now,
in case you're still not convinced...

531
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:12,092
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Boom! Check out my well-designed
endorsement poster.

532
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:22,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's your point, Tito?

533
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:26,908
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My point is, we got a chance
to change our lives for the better.

534
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:31,146
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To make Starlight Plaza
the great place we all know it could be.

535
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,346
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, come on.

536
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:36,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's ready to sponsor
the next Indy 500 champion?

537
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:44,135
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, Tito, but I've got work to do.

538
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:48,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, you don't. None of you do.

539
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,807
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't get it. That poster was awesome.

540
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:57,044
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, good try, you did your best.
Time to go home, Theo.

541
00:41:57,948 --> 00:42:00,315
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're going to Indianapolis, Chet.

542
00:42:00,484 --> 00:42:03,385
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you worry
your chubby little face about that.

543
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:05,547
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, team.

544
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:09,958
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Snail up!

545
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:14,989
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And next up an our tour
is the L.A. River.

546
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:17,395
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Famous for its appearance
in such movies as...

547
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:19,834
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've just been White Shadowed!

548
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:24,197
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Next stop is the Starlight Plaza.

549
00:42:28,512 --> 00:42:29,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes!

550
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:34,207
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Burn. Let's get this party started.

551
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:35,716
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know it.

552
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:40,047
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Snailed it.

553
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:41,888
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Skidmark.
You bringing the beverages?

554
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:45,651
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got a beverage for you.
And a beverage for you.

555
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:56,639
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Light her up, Turbo.
Do your thing, baby.

556
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,207
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa.

557
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:06,014
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Angelo! We got customers.

558
00:43:06,183 --> 00:43:07,309
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa!

559
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:15,685
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. you ready?

560
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:18,053
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go!

561
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:29,063
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. You're good to go.

562
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:31,503
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, everybody. Back on the bus.

563
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:33,602
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mama, you look good!

564
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:36,747
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bye. Come again.
I do weddings, bar mitzvahs.

565
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:38,382
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.
Come back soon.

566
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:40,677
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tomorrow, later on today.
I'll be here.

567
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:42,508
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good luck with that snail of yours.

568
00:43:42,686 --> 00:43:44,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you, my friend.

569
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,778
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I gotta hand it to you, Tito.

570
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:48,687
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For once,
one of your crazy schemes worked.

571
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:49,849
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know!

572
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:52,294
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, hey, if we did better
because of that billboard,

573
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,932
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}just imagine what the Indy 500 could do.

574
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:57,261
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, don't go crazy on me.

575
00:43:57,434 --> 00:44:00,893
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We had a good day.
We sold a few extra tacos.

576
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:03,267
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's good enough.

577
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:23,151
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You better not mess this up, Tito.

578
00:44:25,562 --> 00:44:26,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no.

579
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:29,892
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yes.
We're going to Indianapolis, Chet!

580
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:34,504
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"I" to the "N" to the "Dizzy"
to the "Wizzah." You dig?

581
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,071
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, sir.

582
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:38,999
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One breakfast burrito, please.

583
00:44:44,748 --> 00:44:48,446
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's it.
I'm sorry, honey. Today is the day.

584
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:56,092
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tito!

585
00:44:59,963 --> 00:45:00,953
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you ready, big man?

586
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:03,691
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}On three. One, two...

587
00:45:04,935 --> 00:45:07,563
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Indy. baby!

588
00:45:28,525 --> 00:45:30,721
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got it!
"pasty"!

589
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:32,259
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you kidding me?

590
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:40,101
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Turbo"!

591
00:45:41,672 --> 00:45:45,404
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, as the kids say,
"Time to plump your ride."

592
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:47,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Heck, no!

593
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,442
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's do this.

594
00:45:51,615 --> 00:45:53,879
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, that's more like it.

595
00:46:05,395 --> 00:46:07,796
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No twitching. Voila'!

596
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:12,201
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Suited and booted, gooted and looted,
dipped and whipped!

597
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:14,565
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've got a contender, baby!

598
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,809
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at him go!

599
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:40,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fresh air, baby.

600
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:43,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We ain't in Van Nuys no more.

601
00:46:54,678 --> 00:46:55,736
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi, Chet.

602
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:57,781
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're gonna be my boyfriend!

603
00:46:58,315 --> 00:46:59,612
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna call you "boo."

604
00:46:59,783 --> 00:47:02,309
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Boo"? What does that even mean?

605
00:47:05,756 --> 00:47:08,521
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sure beats the view
from the garden, huh?

606
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:13,159
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't believe you're doing this.

607
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:15,822
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"We." We are doing this.

608
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:18,491
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You. I'm just a hostage.

609
00:47:19,536 --> 00:47:25,532
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Theo, what happens if you wake up
tomorrow, and your powers are gone?

610
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:29,308
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What then?

611
00:47:31,982 --> 00:47:34,508
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then I better make the most of today.

612
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:14,517
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is even bigger than Hobby-Con.

613
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:26,695
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow. Now, that's a car.

614
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:29,498
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa. Shiny.

615
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gagné.

616
00:49:21,024 --> 00:49:23,083
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And Guy Gagné wins the pole,

617
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:27,322
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with a four-lap average
of 230 miles per hour.

618
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,725
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's Gagné's best time yet.

619
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:31,966
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Turbo has never gone that fast.

620
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:33,432
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, yet.

621
00:49:33,603 --> 00:49:37,164
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, you got a plan, Taco Man?

622
00:49:37,341 --> 00:49:39,309
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course I do.

623
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:43,807
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please tell me those phony glasses
are not your plan.

624
00:49:44,548 --> 00:49:47,483
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. That would be ridiculous.

625
00:49:47,784 --> 00:49:50,014
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, phony glasses, do your thing.

626
00:49:54,091 --> 00:49:56,924
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This great.
I'm gonna go have heart attack.

627
00:50:04,801 --> 00:50:07,168
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oué pasa, my friend?

628
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:11,001
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have a driver that
I'd like to enter into the race.

629
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:13,108
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What team does your driver race for?

630
00:50:13,276 --> 00:50:15,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dos Bros Tacos and Company.

631
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,714
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Has he passed the rookie test?

632
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:24,452
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, come here.
Let's cut to the chase, okay?

633
00:50:24,621 --> 00:50:27,318
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have glasses, I have glasses.

634
00:50:27,491 --> 00:50:29,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do we gotta do
to get this done, bro?

635
00:50:29,726 --> 00:50:32,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, let go. Come on, man, let go!

636
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:36,296
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is no way to treat a guy with glasses.
I have astigmatism and stuff.

637
00:50:36,466 --> 00:50:37,661
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, yeah.

638
00:50:42,973 --> 00:50:46,876
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guy, how do you do it, shattering
your own records year after year?

639
00:50:47,344 --> 00:50:50,644
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,
when a cheetah chases after a gazelle,

640
00:50:50,814 --> 00:50:54,182
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}does he ever stop to think,
"Maybe I've caught enough gazelles.

641
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:57,252
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Maybe I should just settle down,
try the vegan thing."

642
00:50:57,421 --> 00:51:00,686
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! He keeps running
as long as his legs will carry him.

643
00:51:00,857 --> 00:51:04,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am like the cheetah. I never give up.

644
00:51:04,528 --> 00:51:06,428
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Next question.

645
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:11,931
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, give me the keys.
I'll drive the first shift home.

646
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:13,865
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa!
What gives?

647
00:51:19,443 --> 00:51:20,672
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no!

648
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,848
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I help you, monsieur?

649
00:51:27,117 --> 00:51:28,209
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One second, please.

650
00:51:28,385 --> 00:51:30,581
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing?
Are you trying to get me arrested?

651
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:36,348
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh.

652
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:39,726
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry! So sorry.
We'll have this under control...

653
00:51:39,896 --> 00:51:41,557
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ladies and gentlemen!

654
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:46,362
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I give you the next Indy 500 champion!

655
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:51,742
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that a snail?

656
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:55,401
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your driver is a snail?

657
00:52:02,419 --> 00:52:04,251
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What kind of welcome is that?

658
00:52:04,421 --> 00:52:07,584
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd say an appropriate welcome,
given the situation.

659
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:09,225
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. Game over, nut job.

660
00:52:09,392 --> 00:52:10,484
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go.

661
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,528
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have a nice flight, Chet.

662
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:14,289
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hit it!
-White Shadow!

663
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:16,963
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Banzai!

664
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:18,825
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get off!

665
00:52:18,902 --> 00:52:20,131
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pedal to the metal, Turbo.

666
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:22,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go!

667
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:26,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa!

668
00:52:40,557 --> 00:52:41,615
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah!

669
00:52:42,225 --> 00:52:44,717
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa! That snail is fast!

670
00:53:08,418 --> 00:53:10,113
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did I miss? What did I miss?

671
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:18,761
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}226! That's fast enough to qualify!

672
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,632
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what I'm talking about!

673
00:53:28,939 --> 00:53:32,204
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa! That snail is fast!

674
00:53:32,309 --> 00:53:35,244
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Man, wait until people see this!

675
00:53:38,949 --> 00:53:43,409
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa! That snail is fast!
What? Are you seeing this?

676
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:47,523
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hello?
-Have you heard?

677
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:49,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, I've heard.

678
00:53:49,259 --> 00:53:50,852
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That snail is fast.

679
00:53:51,027 --> 00:53:53,689
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Forget about it.
This will blow over by noon.

680
00:53:53,863 --> 00:53:56,264
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa! That snail is fast!

681
00:53:57,867 --> 00:53:59,062
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hello?
-Have you seen it?

682
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:01,102
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, I've seen it!

683
00:54:04,708 --> 00:54:07,075
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa! That snail is fast!

684
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:08,336
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

685
00:54:09,112 --> 00:54:11,103
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Snail is fast!

686
00:54:11,281 --> 00:54:14,148
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see the snail moving fast
You slow, you gonna get passed

687
00:54:14,317 --> 00:54:15,978
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see him gaining position for first

688
00:54:16,152 --> 00:54:17,142
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He won't be last

689
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:18,788
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's ready to make a dash

690
00:54:18,955 --> 00:54:20,548
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Snail quicker than a lightning ﬂash

691
00:54:20,724 --> 00:54:23,489
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His engine's roaring, he's ﬂooring
He won't run out of gas

692
00:54:24,628 --> 00:54:26,255
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa! That snail is fast!

693
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:32,629
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa! Are you seeing this?

694
00:54:32,802 --> 00:54:33,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa!

695
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:36,235
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You cannot have a snail in the Indy 500.

696
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:38,272
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a miracle of nature!

697
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:41,433
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will the snail be crushed
by the giant race cars?

698
00:54:42,245 --> 00:54:45,738
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That snail is fast, fast, fast
Fast, fast, fast, fast

699
00:54:49,686 --> 00:54:52,519
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa. That snail is fast.

700
00:54:55,025 --> 00:54:58,962
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've just received word that the CEO
of Indy Car is about to make a statement.

701
00:55:07,103 --> 00:55:09,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And so,
after careful consideration and...

702
00:55:10,173 --> 00:55:13,143
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That snail is fast
That snail is fast

703
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:14,971
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry. My bad.

704
00:55:17,113 --> 00:55:18,581
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've decided...

705
00:55:18,748 --> 00:55:20,011
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please, say yes. Please, say yes.

706
00:55:20,183 --> 00:55:21,617
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please, say no. Please, say no.

707
00:55:21,785 --> 00:55:23,651
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}White Shadow.

708
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:29,457
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've decided that I simply cannot permit
a snail to enter...

709
00:55:29,626 --> 00:55:34,291
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please, sir, give my snail a shot,
and I swear, you won't regret it.

710
00:55:34,931 --> 00:55:39,493
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Lopez, while I appreciate
your enthusiasm, my decision is...

711
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:41,034
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let him race!

712
00:55:41,204 --> 00:55:42,535
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let him race!

713
00:55:42,706 --> 00:55:43,969
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let him race!

714
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:47,201
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let him race! Let him race!
Let him race!

715
00:55:49,379 --> 00:55:51,939
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, now. Order.

716
00:55:52,115 --> 00:55:53,514
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sir, if I may.

717
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:55,879
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You might want to get a two-shot here.

718
00:55:56,052 --> 00:56:01,684
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I, like this passionate gentleman here,
came from humble beginnings.

719
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:04,691
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In the words of my dear father,

720
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:10,322
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"No dream is too big,
and no dreamer, too small."

721
00:56:10,967 --> 00:56:12,833
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that is why I, for one,

722
00:56:13,002 --> 00:56:17,337
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}believe that if the Indy 500
isn't going to put a limit on speed,

723
00:56:17,507 --> 00:56:21,102
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then it shouldn't put a limit on spirit!

724
00:56:22,278 --> 00:56:24,212
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give the people what they want.

725
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:25,974
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let him race!

726
00:56:26,149 --> 00:56:30,711
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let him race! Let him race!
Let him race!

727
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:32,184
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just me.

728
00:56:32,622 --> 00:56:34,021
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whole frame, my face.

729
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:38,723
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right!

730
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:42,729
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"All right," what?

731
00:56:43,366 --> 00:56:47,234
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your snail can compete
in the Indianapolis 500.

732
00:56:49,372 --> 00:56:50,464
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah!

733
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:54,005
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Has the world lost its mind?

734
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:04,878
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To Turbo!

735
00:57:04,988 --> 00:57:07,047
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Starlight Plaza! Hey!

736
00:57:07,223 --> 00:57:08,554
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He ain't slow no more.

737
00:57:08,725 --> 00:57:09,749
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's for sure.

738
00:57:09,826 --> 00:57:10,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shut the door.

739
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:12,691
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get on the floor.

740
00:57:12,862 --> 00:57:14,694
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Barbeque sauce!

741
00:57:16,032 --> 00:57:17,761
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And we're back with more
from Indianapolis.

742
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:19,663
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Check it out. We're on TV.

743
00:57:19,836 --> 00:57:23,033
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Lopez, haw do you feel about
getting to compete in the Indy 500.7

744
00:57:23,206 --> 00:57:25,265
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just so happy.

745
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:29,208
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And we'd all be happy to see you
come an down to the Starlight Plaza.

746
00:57:29,379 --> 00:57:32,405
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just north of the 707
in Van Nays, California.

747
00:57:32,582 --> 00:57:36,348
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kim Ly Nail Salon.
Where we put the "nail" in "snail."

748
00:57:37,353 --> 00:57:40,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Taco Man cried
in front of millions of people.

749
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:04,604
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here you go, Paz. Nice and warm.

750
00:58:04,781 --> 00:58:05,805
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Goodnight, Tito.

751
00:58:05,915 --> 00:58:07,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You comfy enough, Bobby?
-No.

752
00:58:07,784 --> 00:58:09,274
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, let me know if you need anything.

753
00:58:09,452 --> 00:58:11,352
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey! No touching!

754
00:58:14,057 --> 00:58:15,957
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Smooth, smooth, smooth.

755
00:58:16,893 --> 00:58:21,296
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sleep tight, Little Amigo.
We got a big day tomorrow.

756
00:58:22,765 --> 00:58:24,255
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yep.

757
00:58:25,034 --> 00:58:27,196
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Big day, indeed.

758
00:58:27,804 --> 00:58:30,398
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm detecting
a refreshing note of disapproval.

759
00:58:30,573 --> 00:58:33,599
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm worried. And you should be, too.

760
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:35,002
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll be fine.

761
00:58:35,078 --> 00:58:37,809
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are delusional, you know that?

762
00:58:38,414 --> 00:58:41,076
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's Big Red all over again.

763
00:58:41,751 --> 00:58:43,947
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Only this time,
instead of one lawn mower,

764
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:48,557
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it'll be 32 giant, fire-breathing cars!

765
00:58:49,592 --> 00:58:51,458
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I won't be able to save you.

766
00:58:51,628 --> 00:58:54,962
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You won't have to, because this time,
I have speed.

767
00:58:55,131 --> 00:58:58,226
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not a car. You're a snail.

768
00:58:58,835 --> 00:59:02,965
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got a shot here, Chet.
I can do this. You'll see.

769
00:59:03,139 --> 00:59:04,504
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I won't.

770
00:59:04,941 --> 00:59:08,844
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I will not stand by
and watch the only brother I've got

771
00:59:09,012 --> 00:59:13,313
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}risk his life
chasing some impossible dream.

772
00:59:13,917 --> 00:59:15,646
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, Theo.

773
00:59:19,289 --> 00:59:21,781
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All of these people, they believe in me.

774
00:59:22,492 --> 00:59:25,553
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guy Gagné believes in me.

775
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:28,197
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why won't you?

776
00:59:28,364 --> 00:59:32,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And by the way, my name is Turbo.

777
01:00:00,029 --> 01:00:02,361
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. Tout suite, let's go.

778
01:00:12,508 --> 01:00:13,669
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa.

779
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:17,436
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}2.2-liter turbo V6.

780
01:00:17,847 --> 01:00:20,578
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}24-valve quad-overhead cam.

781
01:00:21,184 --> 01:00:24,279
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fastest open-wheel,
single-seat machine on the planet.

782
01:00:25,254 --> 01:00:27,188
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think I'm in love.

783
01:00:29,692 --> 01:00:30,682
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No way.

784
01:00:39,569 --> 01:00:42,368
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not trying
to steal my trophy from me, are you?

785
01:00:45,541 --> 01:00:49,569
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because if you want one for yourself,
you may have a long wait.

786
01:00:49,746 --> 01:00:50,804
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Espresso?

787
01:00:51,881 --> 01:00:55,977
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, you are my little competition, eh?

788
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:58,553
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The underdog versus the champion.

789
01:00:58,721 --> 01:01:01,747
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The world loves the underdogs, you know.

790
01:01:01,924 --> 01:01:04,791
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The dreamers out there, they need them.

791
01:01:04,961 --> 01:01:09,626
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Need to believe that one day, maybe
they could achieve the impossible, too.

792
01:01:12,435 --> 01:01:16,963
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, the sad truth is,
underdogs seldom win.

793
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:19,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And dreamers?

794
01:01:20,076 --> 01:01:23,102
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's just say, eventually,
they have to wake up.

795
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:31,283
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've never talked to a snail before.
So small, so amusing.

796
01:01:31,454 --> 01:01:33,786
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No wonder they want to see you race, eh?

797
01:01:33,956 --> 01:01:36,482
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Vroom! Vroom!

798
01:01:36,659 --> 01:01:38,491
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at him go.

799
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:40,459
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you, plucky snail.

800
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:45,466
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because of you,
the whole world will be watching this race.

801
01:01:45,635 --> 01:01:50,835
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And when the checkered flag drops,
they'll be watching me win.

802
01:01:55,478 --> 01:01:57,708
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Crawl home, garden snail,

803
01:02:00,783 --> 01:02:02,774
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}while you still can.

804
01:02:06,155 --> 01:02:08,021
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good afternoon, race fans,

805
01:02:08,191 --> 01:02:12,458
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and welcome to this year's running
of the Indianapolis 500.

806
01:02:12,628 --> 01:02:17,065
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Televised in aver 200 countries
and aired in 3.7 different languages,

807
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:18,894
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}this is no longer just a race,

808
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:22,197
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}this is the day you'll be telling
your grandchildren about.

809
01:02:24,841 --> 01:02:29,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where were you the day they let

811
01:02:41,324 --> 01:02:43,656
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, team meeting. Bring it in.

812
01:02:43,893 --> 01:02:48,091
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is it, Little Amigo.
This is our moment. Our time.

813
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:50,824
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Today is the day we make our mark.

814
01:02:53,236 --> 01:02:55,933

816
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:09,676
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, little snail. Are you lost?

817
01:03:09,852 --> 01:03:10,842
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

818
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:13,184
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you a boy, or a girl?

819
01:03:13,256 --> 01:03:16,624
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why is this confusing? I'm not a girl!

820
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:20,892
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And there they are, folks.

a.k.a. "The Brazilian Butcher. "

823
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:31,062
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He actually was a butcher
before he got into race car driving.

824
01:03:34,377 --> 01:03:37,039
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gagné! Gagné! Gagné!

830
01:04:02,538 --> 01:04:05,269
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, food trucks
are actually very popular these days.

831
01:04:05,441 --> 01:04:08,433
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I tell you what,
I do lave a good torta.

834
01:04:22,558 --> 01:04:25,823
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is amazing what you can do
an your printer at home.

835
01:04:26,062 --> 01:04:29,999
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tito, you better know what you're doing.

836
01:04:30,166 --> 01:04:33,625
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here you go, little snail.
Now you've got the best seat in the house.

837
01:04:37,607 --> 01:04:40,975
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no. Nope.
This isn't happening.

838
01:04:41,143 --> 01:04:42,633
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I gotta get out of here.

839
01:04:43,112 --> 01:04:44,978
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stay here. I'll be right back.

840
01:04:45,147 --> 01:04:48,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Help! Let me out. Let me out!

841
01:04:49,986 --> 01:04:51,317
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Breathe.

842
01:04:51,954 --> 01:04:53,945
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good afternoon and welcome

843
01:04:54,123 --> 01:04:58,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to what has became the most
anticipated and unprecedented

844
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:01,694
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}running of the Indianapolis 500.

845
01:05:01,864 --> 01:05:04,128

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}start your engines!

848
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:25,183
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's like an earthquake!

849
01:05:25,354 --> 01:05:27,152
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love it. Is it weird that I love it?

850
01:05:27,323 --> 01:05:29,223
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everyone, off the track, please.

851
01:05:29,392 --> 01:05:31,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See you in the winner's circle,
garden snail.

852
01:05:31,527 --> 01:05:33,188
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Easy to the peasy, baby.

853
01:05:33,396 --> 01:05:36,195
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everything's gonna be fine, okay?
We can do this, right?

854
01:05:37,733 --> 01:05:39,701
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wish I was tiny,
so I can give you a hug.

855
01:05:39,869 --> 01:05:40,859
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get off the track!

856
01:05:41,037 --> 01:05:44,598
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, okay, I'm going!
Good luck out there, Turbo!

857
01:06:05,194 --> 01:06:06,958
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did anybody bring earplugs?

858
01:06:07,129 --> 01:06:08,153
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

859
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:10,455
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't watch this.

860
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:13,364
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The pace car is off
and the parade laps are underway.

861
01:06:13,536 --> 01:06:19,737
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Only moments until the green ﬂag drops,
and history is made here at Indianapolis.

862
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:49,305
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's do this.

863
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:51,338
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the race is an!

865
01:07:16,132 --> 01:07:17,827
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Turbo, struggling out there.

866
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,026
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Looks like the party is over
for the motoring mollusk.

867
01:07:26,275 --> 01:07:27,674
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's getting killed out there.

868
01:07:27,843 --> 01:07:30,141
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What have we done?

869
01:07:34,850 --> 01:07:36,875
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa. That snail is history.

870
01:07:37,853 --> 01:07:39,446
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think I'm gonna be sick.

871
01:07:57,339 --> 01:08:00,206
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, garden snail.
Get your head in the game!

872
01:08:21,197 --> 01:08:22,926
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go, go, go!

873
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:28,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, go, go. so!

874
01:08:32,041 --> 01:08:34,237
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on!
We're supposed to be a team, here!

875
01:08:34,310 --> 01:08:35,368
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're trying.

876
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:38,539
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a snail.
There's not that much to do.

877
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:42,513
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's it. This pit crew
is officially under new management.

878
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:47,055
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, this is how it's done. Air jack.

879
01:08:47,223 --> 01:08:48,782
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack-tivate.

880
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:50,255

882
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:53,019
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wax on, wax off.

883
01:08:53,195 --> 01:08:54,492
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Fuel!
-Down the hatch.

884
01:08:54,563 --> 01:08:55,655

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Foot massage.

886
01:08:56,866 --> 01:08:58,197
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know it.

887
01:08:58,567 --> 01:09:00,057
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Relaxing vibes.

888

889
01:09:02,571 --> 01:09:04,972
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, de-lax those vibes!

890
01:09:05,207 --> 01:09:06,299
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you crazy?

891
01:09:06,542 --> 01:09:08,806
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I'm crazy!
What made you think I was sane?

892
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:10,241
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know how to...

893
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:11,977
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Are you a car?
-No.

894
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:13,673
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you a car?

895
01:09:13,749 --> 01:09:14,841
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

896
01:09:14,917 --> 01:09:17,249
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then stop driving like one!

897
01:09:18,454 --> 01:09:20,752
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now get out there. Snail up, baby!

898
01:09:20,923 --> 01:09:22,891
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go, T-boogie, go!

899
01:09:29,064 --> 01:09:30,828
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gagné with a commanding lead now.

Turbo just went under a car!

906
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:11,336
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you see that?

907
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:22,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Despite a rocky start,
it looks like Turbo is gaining some ground.

908
01:10:22,284 --> 01:10:24,446
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah! Now we're talking!

01:10:29,358 --> 01:10:32,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where is he? Where is he?

910
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:49,541
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He passed another one!

911
01:10:49,712 --> 01:10:50,907
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah!

912
01:10:51,714 --> 01:10:54,547
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's my brother, right there.
That's the back of his head!

913
01:11:08,197 --> 01:11:10,359
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go, go, go! Left turn! Left turn!

914
01:11:10,532 --> 01:11:12,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah! Left turn!

915
01:11:26,548 --> 01:11:30,041
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Turbo maneuvers past Shelby Stone
and into second place!

916
01:11:30,219 --> 01:11:32,187
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He is hot on Gagné's heels!

917
01:11:32,354 --> 01:11:34,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The snail's not going away, Guy.

918
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:36,916
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, I know, I know!

919
01:11:46,535 --> 01:11:49,027
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These racers better watch it
coming in to turn four.

920
01:11:49,204 --> 01:11:52,196
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This late in the race,
that outside edge is full of marbles.

921
01:11:52,374 --> 01:11:54,775
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you don't want to play
with these marbles, kids.

922
01:11:54,943 --> 01:11:58,641
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That rubber peeling off the tires
can be a minefield for these drivers.

923
01:12:00,549 --> 01:12:01,948
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here we go.

924
01:12:25,841 --> 01:12:26,865
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Turbo!

925
01:12:27,776 --> 01:12:28,971
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no.

926
01:12:33,982 --> 01:12:35,472
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, man.

927
01:12:35,784 --> 01:12:38,617
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are we gonna do?
If he takes another hit like that last one...

928
01:12:38,787 --> 01:12:41,688
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You gotta pull him, Tito.

929
01:12:43,792 --> 01:12:47,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, Little Amigo. it's over.

930
01:12:56,905 --> 01:12:57,963
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey.

931
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:02,074
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got this far. it's good enough.

932
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:06,807
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, it's not.

933
01:13:09,151 --> 01:13:13,281
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With the green ﬂag about to be waved,
it looks like a mere formality at this point.

934
01:13:13,455 --> 01:13:16,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gagné, just five laps a way from victory.

935
01:13:16,892 --> 01:13:20,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait a minute!
Turbo is still in this thing!

936
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:33,466
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

937
01:13:34,443 --> 01:13:36,275
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa! What happened there?

938
01:13:39,815 --> 01:13:41,249
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, come on!

939
01:13:48,157 --> 01:13:49,181
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

940
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:50,282
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Theo!

941
01:13:55,497 --> 01:13:57,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

942
01:13:59,568 --> 01:14:02,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not this time. Come on!

943
01:14:09,578 --> 01:14:11,012
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Turbo. Come on, Turbo.

944
01:14:14,349 --> 01:14:17,444
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on,
just hold in there a little longer.

945
01:14:26,228 --> 01:14:27,252
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

946
01:14:36,672 --> 01:14:37,901
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

947
01:14:40,175 --> 01:14:41,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Farewell, little snail.

948
01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:58,353
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Unbelievable! Turbo takes the lead.

949
01:14:59,595 --> 01:15:01,222
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Snail-style, baby!

950
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:03,391
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bad idea. Bad idea.

951
01:15:05,033 --> 01:15:09,368
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the white flag is in the air
as we enter the 200th and final lap.

952
01:15:10,005 --> 01:15:12,736
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Turbo weaving between lapped cars
like a snail possessed.

953
01:15:12,908 --> 01:15:16,538
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He is determined to hold onto his lead.

954
01:15:27,689 --> 01:15:28,747
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

955
01:15:30,425 --> 01:15:32,917
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I will not lose to a snail!

956
01:15:34,429 --> 01:15:36,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gagné is in the marbles!

957
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:39,565
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guy, what are you doing?

958
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:02,281
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Theo!

959
01:16:07,663 --> 01:16:08,755
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Turbo!

960
01:16:10,165 --> 01:16:14,432
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The track is hacked up
all the way down the front straight.

961
01:16:14,603 --> 01:16:17,664
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's complete gridlock down there.

962
01:16:19,808 --> 01:16:22,004
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't see him. I can't see him.

963
01:16:22,177 --> 01:16:23,804
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guy, are you okay?

964
01:16:28,450 --> 01:16:30,009
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where am I?

965
01:16:37,793 --> 01:16:38,851
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There he is.

966
01:16:38,927 --> 01:16:39,917
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Theo.

967
01:16:39,995 --> 01:16:41,656
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's finish this.

968
01:17:00,182 --> 01:17:01,581
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no.

969
01:17:02,484 --> 01:17:03,815
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Turbo.

970
01:17:17,933 --> 01:17:22,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no.
Theo, what are you doing? Don't give up.

971
01:17:34,783 --> 01:17:37,013
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey! Where are you going?

972
01:17:37,185 --> 01:17:38,243
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no!

973
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,254
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get back here! No, wait!

974
01:17:42,858 --> 01:17:45,691
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! Little snail!

975
01:17:45,861 --> 01:17:47,124
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Theo!

976
01:17:47,696 --> 01:17:49,061
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that Chet?

977
01:17:54,136 --> 01:17:58,972
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear
what I clearly just heard.

978
01:18:03,412 --> 01:18:04,436
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Salt!

979
01:18:10,018 --> 01:18:12,419
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Crows? Are you kidding me?

980
01:18:13,488 --> 01:18:15,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Long time no see, Chet!

981
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:20,829
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey! Don't test me, crow.

982
01:18:22,564 --> 01:18:23,588
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}White Shadow!

983
01:18:26,134 --> 01:18:28,398
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nice moves back there, boo.

984
01:18:34,342 --> 01:18:36,367
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is this really necessary?

985
01:18:36,545 --> 01:18:39,014
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, man. But it's fun.

986
01:18:43,652 --> 01:18:44,676
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Theo!

987
01:18:46,054 --> 01:18:47,146
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Theo!

988
01:18:56,164 --> 01:18:57,188
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chet?

989
01:18:57,265 --> 01:18:58,664
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Finish this!

990
01:19:00,102 --> 01:19:01,228
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't.

991
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:03,599
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yes, you can.

992
01:19:03,772 --> 01:19:05,331
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're right, you know.

993
01:19:05,507 --> 01:19:09,375
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is in you. it's always been in you.

994
01:19:10,879 --> 01:19:14,372
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, I did not just face
every fear known to snail-kind

995
01:19:14,549 --> 01:19:18,076
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to come down here
and watch you hide in your shell.

996
01:19:18,253 --> 01:19:21,416
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sitting on a crow,
for crying out loud!

997
01:19:22,524 --> 01:19:24,549
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't even think about it.

998
01:19:26,528 --> 01:19:29,623
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And my little brother never gives up.

999
01:19:30,065 --> 01:19:32,898
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's the best thing about you.

1000
01:19:33,635 --> 01:19:37,094
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, you get out there
and you win this...

1001
01:19:38,073 --> 01:19:39,302
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Turbo.

1002
01:19:58,126 --> 01:19:59,457
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's still going.

1003
01:20:09,137 --> 01:20:11,105
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Son of a gun.

1004
01:20:25,187 --> 01:20:26,586
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, come on!

1005
01:20:44,606 --> 01:20:47,701
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Unbelievable! The race is back on!

1006
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:50,442
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

1007
01:20:51,813 --> 01:20:53,042
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Little Amigo!

1008
01:20:56,551 --> 01:20:59,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, snail!
He's gradually gaining on you!

1009
01:21:24,579 --> 01:21:26,013
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on! Come on!

1010
01:21:38,059 --> 01:21:40,551
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Turbo! Tuck and roll!

1011
01:22:04,552 --> 01:22:07,419
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And Turbo wins it by a shell!

1012
01:22:07,589 --> 01:22:08,954
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what I'm talking about!

1013
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:13,527
