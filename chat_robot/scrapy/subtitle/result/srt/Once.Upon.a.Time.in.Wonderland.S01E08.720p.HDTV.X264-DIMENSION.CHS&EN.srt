《仙境奇缘》前情提要
Previously in Wonderland...

15
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,460
容我向你们介绍  你们的皇后
I give you your queen!

16
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,030
我的所有之物  都是我自己争取来的
Everything I have, I had to take.

17
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:09,850
那么你的所失之物呢
What about everything you've lost?

18
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:11,430
安娜斯塔西娅
Anastasia!

19
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:13,720
你
You?

20
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,850
别再小看我了  贾法尔
Stop underestimating me, Jafar.

21
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,590
瓶子在我的手上
I have the bottle.

22
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,020
找到他  精灵逃跑了
Find him! The genie escaped.

23
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,510
我来找你了
I'm coming for you.

24
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:22,990
我们本是朋友
We were friends.

25
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,850
他怎么能那样背叛我呢
How could he just betray me like that?

26
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,660
女王陛下  我已经履行了我的义务
Your majesty, I-I've fulfilled my obligation--

27
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,030
-我...  -承诺就是用来违背的
- I, uh... - Promises were made to be broken.

28
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,700
我许的愿望好像是流星
I believe I was promised falling stars,

29
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,440
但只有星星
and yet... just stars.

30
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,760
耐心点  就快了
Be patient. It's almost time.

31
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,350
太不可思议了
That's incredible.

32
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,290
据说
You know, they say,

33
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,490
在流星下接吻
one kiss under the falling stars,

34
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:06,520
会给你带来好运
and it brings you good fortune.

35
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:08,810
如果你想吻我
If you want to kiss me,

36
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,550
没必要编个故事出来啊
you don't have to make up a story.

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,420
这是真的
It wasn't a story.

38
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:45,670
这是什么
What's this?

39
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,320
是个小玩意儿  没什么
Ah, it's a trinket. It's nothing.

40
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,540
这挺漂亮的啊
It's a very nice nothing.

41
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,350
是别的姑娘送你的吗
Was it from another girl?

42
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,070
算是吧
In a way.

43
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,400
是我妈妈送我的
It's--my mother gave it to me.

44
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,820
你妈妈
Your mother?

45
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,750
我还不知道精灵也有妈妈呢
I didn't know genies had mothers.

46
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:06,140
她也是精灵吗
Was she a genie as well?

47
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,210
不  她是人类
No, she was quite human.

48
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,180
就和我出生时一样
As was I when I was born.

49
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,180
你是说
You mean...

50
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,800
你并非生下来就是精灵
you haven't always been a genie?

51
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,250
你怎么不告诉我
Why didn't you tell me?

52
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,130
因为我现在是精灵
Oh, because I'm a genie now,

53
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,970
恐怕我以后会一直当精灵了
and I fear I shall be a genie for the rest of my days.

54
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,500
我当人类的日子已经很遥远了
My life as a human was a long time ago.

55
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,790
你妈妈呢  她还...
And your mother? Is she still--

56
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:34,810
我不知道
I don't know.

57
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,650
这个罗盘
This compass...

58
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,410
拥有强大的魔法
it has great magic.

59
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,970
一直向我指引着她的方向
And it always pointed me towards her.

60
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,970
我在瓶子里关着的那些年里
It was the only thing I kept with me

61
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,160
我就带着这个罗盘
in the bottle for all those years I was a prisoner.

62
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,050
它能给我慰藉
It provided me comfort.

63
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,410
我知道她在外面
I knew she was out there.

64
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,660
几年前  它...
And then some years ago, it...

65
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,750
不再指示方向了
just stopped pointing.

66
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,130
对不起
I'm sorry.

67
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:18,010
站起来
Stand up.

68
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,270
离那姑娘远点
And step away from the girl.

69
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,280
我们花了很长时间
It took us a long time, boys,

70
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,990
但终于找到一个精灵了
but we finally found ourselves a genie.

71
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,630
看来愿望真的会实现
Looks like wishes do come true.

72
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,620
你想要什么都行  但求求你放了她
I will give you whatever you desire, but please let her be.

73
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,140
我要她干什么
What would I want with her?

74
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:38,620
一旦我的愿望实现  
Once I get my wishes,

75
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,150
就能得到一百个像她那样的姑娘
I could have a hundred like her!

76
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,440
现在
Now...

77
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,700
你的瓶子在哪  精灵
where is your bottle, genie?

78
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,730
离这里很远  但我可以带你过去
It's far from here, but I can take you to it.

79
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,540
你最好说的是实话
Better be telling the truth now.

80
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,750
我可是不好惹的
I am not to be trifled with!

81
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,120
幸运的是
Fortunately...

82
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:56,960
她也不好惹
neither is she.

83
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,740
看来星星真的给我们带来了好运
I guess the stars did bring us luck.

84
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,930
他们都没划伤我
They barely even scratched me.

85
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,240
爱丽丝
Alice...

86
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:42,980
爱丽丝  不要
Alice, no!

87
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,690
杰克  你吓我一跳  去哪儿了
Knave. You gave me a fright. Where were you?

88
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:19,940
抱歉  大自然在召唤我
Sorry, nature was calling.

89
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,870
真的吗  它说了什么
Really? What did it say?

90
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,040
相信我  你不会想听到的
Nothing you want to hear, trust me.

91
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,050
那些守卫是在找我们吗
So those guards out there-- they're looking for us?

92
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,830
不  他们在找一个逃跑的人
No. They're looking for someone who's escaped.

93
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,650
他们在找塞勒斯
They're looking for Cyrus.

94
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,910
那就好
Oh, well, that's good then.

95
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,140
那怎么算好消息
How is that good news?

96
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,480
因为他们还在找他
'Cause if they're still looking for him,

97
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,130
就说明他们还没找到他
it means they haven't found him yet.

98
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,800
但这只不过是时间问题
But it's only a matter of time,

99
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,570
所以我建议我们也开始寻找
so I suggest we start looking, too.

100
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,060
其实我们没那必要
Actually, we don't have to.

101
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:47,930
为什么
Why is that?

102
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,390
因为我知道他要去哪
Because I know where he's going.

103
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,180
那会是哪里呢
Where might that be?

104
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:53,470
他知道的唯一安全的地方
The only place he knows where he'll be safe.

105
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,930
在仙境里吗
In Wonderland?

106
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,250
贾法尔和红心王后还在找他呢
With Jafar and the Red Queen after him?

107
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,200
我觉得这种地方不存在
I doubt such a place exists.

108
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:00,410
有的
There is.

109
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,730
他只是得在他们找到他之前  赶去那里
He just needs to get there before they get him.

110
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:18,960
这是什么
What's this?

111
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,140
拜托
Come on!

112
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,240
拜托
Come on...

113
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,910
拜托  帮帮忙
Come on, a little help.

114
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,740
总有办法脱身的
There's got to be a way out of this.

115
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:32,930
拜托
Come on!

116
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,160
精灵
The genie.

117
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,010
谢谢你  葡萄藤
Thank you, grapevine.

118
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,330
我相信王后会很高兴的
I believe the queen will be quite pleased.

119
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,700
如您要求  大人
As you requested, sire.

120
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,890
你取走它时没人发现你吧
You were able to procure it with no incident?

121
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:03,950
是的
Yes.

122
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,880
女王完全不知情
The queen has no idea.

123
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,190
你...你会保护我不受她伤害吗
Uh, you--you'll protect me from her?

124
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,680
不久之后她就不再重要了
Soon she will no longer matter.

125
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,120
感谢你的牺牲
Thank you for your sacrifice.

126
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,310
-女王陛下  -干嘛
- Your majesty. - Hmm...

127
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,510
我从葡萄藤那听到了点消息
I've heard something through the grapevine.

128
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,270
说吧
Yes?

129
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:33,000
那个精灵在森林里被抓住了
Th-the genie has been captured in the forest.

130
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,150
他现在是你的了
He's yours now.

131
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,850
干得漂亮
Spectacular!

132
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,680
我们去把他带回来吧
Let's go retrieve him, shall we?

133
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,250
你好像没在分享我的喜悦啊
Well, I'm sensing you're not sharing my enthusiasm.

134
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,670
-你怎么了  -是我哥哥的事
- What is it? - It's my brother.

135
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:46,410
亲爱的  我对你们的手足相残不感兴趣
Darling, your sibling rivalry does not interest me.

136
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:48,700
我担心他做了件坏事
I fear he may have done a bad thing.

137
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,740
考虑到你们俩的智商
Considering both of your mental limitations,

138
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,720
我觉得应该没什么需要我担心的事
I'm not sure it's something I need to worry about.

139
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,620
我看见他给了贾法尔一个东西
I saw him give something to Jafar.

140
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,050
什么
What?

141
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:01,250
一个包裹  偷偷给他的
A bag. Handed it to him in secret.

142
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:02,570
包裹里面有什么
What was in it?

143
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,570
我不知道
I don't know.

144
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,460
但是我马上就来找您了
But I came to you right away.

145
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,670
我不知道里面有什么  我很抱歉
I don't know what it is, and I'm sorry.

146
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:10,550
不用道歉
No need for apologies.

147
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,890
趁我还没想杀掉报信人之前快走
Now leave before I decide to kill the messenger.

148
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,330
所以我们要去哪
So where are we headed?

149
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,790
你所谓安全的地方到底在哪
Where exactly is this safe place of yours?

150
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:53,960
在边境
The outlands.

151
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,970
所以我们要一路走到边境去吗
We're gonna walk all the way to the bloody outlands?

152
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,160
你就不能找个近点的地方吗  比如...
You couldn't have picked someplace closer, like...

153
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:00,720
其它任何地方
Anywhere else?

154
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,140
我和塞勒斯还在一起的时候
Back when Cyrus and I were together,

155
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:06,030
我们说好  如果有天我们走散了
we made a deal that if we ever got separated

156
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:09,000
或者发生了什么事  我们会在那里重聚
or if anything ever happened, we'd always meet back there.

157
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:10,850
你有在那留点吃的吗
Any chance you've left any food there?

158
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:11,380
我可以吃一点...
I could use a bit of--

159
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,470
在去那之前  我得先去个地方稍作停留
I just need to make a stop before we arrive.

160
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,750
那是当然了  我们去哪
Oh, of course we bloody do. Where now?

161
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:17,120
白兔的家
The white rabbit's house.

162
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:18,860
别这样
Oh, come on.

163
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,860
我知道你很记恨它背叛了我们
I know you're ticked off about how he betrayed us,

164
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,520
但现在真是找它算账的好时机吗
but is this really the time to settle a score?

165
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,720
我不是想报仇  杰克  我需要帮助
I don't want revenge, Knave. I want help.

166
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,590
让它帮忙吗  它可是个叛徒啊
From him? He's a bloody traitor.

167
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:33,080
它也是我们唯一逃出仙境的办法
And he's our only way out of Wonderland.

168
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,380
你还不懂吗
Don't you see?

169
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,380
只要贾法尔和红皇后还活着
With Jafar and the red queen alive,

170
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,850
我们在这永远都不安全
we'll never be safe here.

171
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:41,540
你  我和塞勒斯今天必须离开
You, me, and Cyrus, we need to leave today.

172
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,580
而只有兔子能带我们逃走
And the rabbit's the only one that can take us away.

173
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,480
在它做出这些事之后  我们不能相信它
We can't trust him, not after what he's done.

174
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:50,960
它和我以前是朋友  很好的朋友
He and I were friends once. Good friends.

175
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,320
这真的不合情理
It just doesn't make sense.

176
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,250
也许它只是得到了更好的条件
Maybe he just got a better offer.

177
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,670
有时候人们会背叛你
Sometimes people turn on you,

178
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,720
而你永远也不明白为什么
and you'll never understand why.

179
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:03,490
不对  它这么绝情地背叛了我们
No. For him to betray us that bad,

180
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,060
肯定有它的理由
there has to be a reason.

181
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,580
开门  求你了兔子  快开门
Open up! Please, rabbit, open the door!

182
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,030
来了  来了  小声点
All right, all right. Keep it down.

183
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,750
你想要吵醒所有...
Do you want to wake the whole famil--

184
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:26,390
爱丽丝  怎么了
Alice! What happened?

185
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,680
我们受到了攻击  我们需要帮助
We were attacked. We need help.

186
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,350
只有她能提供的帮助
The kind of help only she can provide.

187
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,150
好了
All right now.

188
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,480
你们俩  别挡我的路  快走
Ugh! You two, get out of my way! Shoo!

189
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,680
让一下  去站在我的药前面
Excuse me. Standing in front of my willow root.

190
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,570
她会好起来吧
Is she going to be all right?

191
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:45,300
药糊会让她好起来
This poultice will help her along.

192
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,280
你的唠叨却没什么用
Your fretting, not so much.

193
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,380
我不能什么也不做
Well, I can't just do nothing.

194
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,670
小声点
Shh!

195
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,220
孩子们还在睡觉呢
The children.

196
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,640
对不起
I'm sorry.

197
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:57,410
原谅我  我就这么闯进你的家
Forgive me. I've barged into your home, and--

198
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:58,730
你做得对
And a good thing you did,

199
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,670
要不然她活不过今晚
or she wouldn't survive the night.

200
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,920
但现在最好帮助她的方法
But the best way to help her now

201
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,310
就是让我做我的事
is to let me do my work.

202
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,130
你是来收工的吗
You've come to finish the job?

203
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,710
不全是
Not exactly.

204
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,250
我们去兜兜风怎么样
Shall we go for a ride?

205
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,660
那取决于我们要去哪了
Well, that depends where we're going.

206
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,490
你应该待的地方  亲爱的
Where you belong, darling.

207
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,630
回你的瓶子里去
Back to your bottle.

208
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,420
终于到手了
At last.

209
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,130
不
No!

210
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,350
地方不错啊
Nice spot.

211
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:06,820
一只兔子都住得比你好的时候
There's something wrong in the world

212
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,870
这世界肯定是出了问题
when a rabbit has a nicer flat than you do.

213
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,270
这地方看起来不一样了
It looks different here.

214
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:14,930
这些草都没人打理
The grass is overgrown.

215
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,200
萝卜也发霉了
The carrots are all moldy.

216
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,050
也许它已经不住这里了
Maybe he abandoned the place.

217
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,910
或者它只是希望别人这么以为
Or maybe that's just what he wants people to think he did.

218
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,450
兔子  是我  爱丽丝
Rabbit, it's me. It's Alice.

219
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:42,390
兔子
Rabbit!

220
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,760
我们还能在其他什么地方找到它吗
Any other idea where we might find him?

221
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,420
可以
Yes.

222
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:49,230
在这里面能
In here.

223
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:56,140
兔子
Rabbit?

224
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:58,370
你在哪  我知道你在里面
Where are you? I know you're in here.

225
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:00,620
我在这里  爱丽丝
Over here, Alice.

226
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,760
我任你处置
Do what you want with me.

227
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,020
其他人已经处置过我了
Everyone else has.

228
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,920
你到底怎么了
What happened to you?

229
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,120
我
I...

230
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:19,530
我背叛了你  爱丽丝  背叛了你和塞勒斯
I betrayed you, Alice. You and Cyrus.

231
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:20,430
还有我
And me.

232
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,540
是的  还有你  杰克
Yes, even you, Knave.

233
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,780
兔子
Rabbit...

234
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,410
我们已经知道了
we already know.

235
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,700
而且知道已久了
We have for quite some time.

236
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,090
那  那你为什么还来这里
Then... then why are you here?

237
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:37,760
因为我需要你最后一次的帮助
Because I need your help. One last time.

238
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,100
爱丽丝  我
Oh, Alice. I...

239
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,180
塞勒斯获得自由
Cyrus is free.

240
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,990
我们就要重聚了
And we're going to be reunited.

241
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:47,200
在我们重聚时  我要你在我身边
And when we are, I need you to be there.

242
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:51,280
这样我们就回家  永远离开这里
So we can go home, and leave this behind for good.

243
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:56,110
对不起  但是我做不到
I'm sorry, but... I... I can't.

244
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:58,790
你能做到  而且肯定会
You can. And you bloody well will.

245
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,580
在你做了这么多事之后  你欠她太多
After everything you've done, you owe her that much.

246
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,330
我欠她的更多
I owe her more,

247
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,980
但是在是否该做和是否能做之间
but there's a difference between what I should do

248
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:08,110
还是有区别的
and what I'm able to do.

249
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:11,730
王后抓了我的家人
The queen... she has my family--

250
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,080
我的妻子和孩子
my wife, my children.

251
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:19,480
我所做的一切  只是为了保住他们的性命
Everything I've done, I've done to keep them alive.

252
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:22,250
很抱歉让你因此而受伤害
I-I'm sorry you've had to suffer because of it,

253
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,570
但你比谁都更清楚
but-- but you know better than anyone

254
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,740
当你爱的人身陷危险中
when someone you love is in danger,

255
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,530
你会不惜一切地去救他们
you'll do anything to save them.

256
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,630
我很理解
I do understand.

257
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:39,570
我也是
Me, too.

258
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,800
显然我也理解
I also apparently understand.

259
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:44,230
没人会知道你帮过我们的  兔子
No one has to know that you helped us, Rabbit.

260
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,330
红心王后会知道
The red queen would know!

261
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,940
就算你找到另一条离开仙境的路
And even if you found another way out of Wonderland,

262
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,230
她还是会怪我
she'd blame me!

263
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:53,640
我的任务就是留在你身边  向她通风报信
It was my job to stay with you, to be her ears,

264
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,490
告诉她你一切的行动
to tell her everything you were doing.

265
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:59,940
那如果我们把他们救出来呢
What if... we rescued them?

266
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:01,860
你的家人
Your family.

267
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,650
我们就能一起离开了
We can all leave together.

268
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,440
那你得先找到他们
Well, you'd have to find them first.

269
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,900
我已经找过每一个我认为王后
I've already searched every place I can think of

270
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,490
有可能关押他们的地方了
where the queen would hide them,

271
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,030
最后都没能找到
and failed miserably.

272
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:14,520
好吧
All right.

273
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,320
也许我能帮上忙
Maybe I can help.

274
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:21,220
我也许不知道王后贮藏重要物品的地方
I might not know where the queen stashed something important,

275
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,180
但我确实知道安娜斯塔西娅的贮藏地
but I do know where Anastasia might.

276
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:26,900
安娜斯塔西娅是谁
Well, who's Anastasia?

277
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,820
这是什么地方
What is this place?

278
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,010
我们来这干什么
What are we doing here?

279
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,260
是的  没错  精灵
Yes, that's right, genie.

280
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:29,600
你要做一个非常重大的决定
You have a very big decision to make.

281
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,370
塞勒斯
Cyrus.

282
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,600
她不会有事的
She's going to be fine.

283
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:58,920
谢谢的
Thank you.

284
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:00,310
暂时的
For now.

285
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:02,760
暂时是什么意思
What does that mean?

286
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,710
意思说我们来帮忙
It means it's a damn good thing

287
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,080
是件非常好的事
that we were here to help.

288
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:08,360
但如果我们回不了家呢
But what if we hadn't been home?

289
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:09,990
下一次要怎么做
What about next time?

290
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,380
下一次我就会更加小心
Next time I'll be more careful.

291
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,240
那再下一次呢
And the time after that?

292
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,090
这对爱丽丝来说算是什么生活啊
What kind of life is this for Alice?

293
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:18,290
永远被追捕  睡在树底下
Always hunted, sleeping under trees.

294
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:20,430
这是我们一起选择的生活
It's a life we chose. Together.

295
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,230
你的选择不代表那就适合你
Just because you chose it doesn't make it right

296
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,590
或者适合她
for you or her.

297
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:27,760
爱丽丝还是个小女孩时  我就认识她了
I've known Alice since she was a little girl.

298
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,600
她一直想要个家
She always wanted a place to call home.

299
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,570
现在我们俩组成了一个家
I'm her home now. As she is mine.

300
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,810
你总是要用比喻说话吗
Yeah, uh... must you always speak in metaphor?

301
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:38,900
这是事实  我们也许没有温暖的壁炉
It's the truth. You know, we may not have a warm hearth

302
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:42,710
或一瓦遮头  但我们的命运联系在一起
or a roof to sleep under, but our life together,

303
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,380
这超越了我们的想象
it's better than we could have imagined.

304
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,720
正如我所说  这只是暂时的
As I said, for now.

305
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:50,060
但我们俩都知道  这不可能永远继续下去
but we both know this can't go on forever.

306
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:54,680
我在瓶子里待了很长时间
You know, I spent years alone in that bottle.

307
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,500
而你现在告诉我应该再次形影单只吗
Now you're telling me I should be alone once more?

308
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,980
如果我的家人陷入危险
If my family were in danger,

309
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:03,790
我会不惜一切地去保护他们
I would do whatever it took to protect them.

310
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:07,550
也许唯一真正能保护爱丽丝的方法
Perhaps the only way to truly protect Alice

311
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,620
就是让她走
is to let her go.

312
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,280
女王陛下
Your majesty!

313
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:36,780
人都去哪了
Where is everyone?

314
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,740
贾法尔亲启

315
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,230
我想她看穿我们的意图了
I think she's on to us.

316
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:11,050
贾法尔在你的棋盘那边  女王陛下
Jafar's on your side of the board, your majesty.

317
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,510
看来你的招数用尽了
It looks like you're running out of moves.

318
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,440
他可能摧毁了几个棋子
He may have destroyed a few pieces,

319
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,410
但是在象棋中只有一个王后
but in the game of chess there's only one queen,

320
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,350
就算其他的棋子加在一起  都不如王后重要
and she's more important than them all put together.

321
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:23,060
也许吧  但貌似现在下棋的不是贾法尔
Perhaps, but it doesn't look like Jafar's playing games.

322
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:24,950
也不是我
Neither am I.

323
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,780
告诉我  爱丽丝在哪里
Now tell me, where is Alice?

324
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,210
我为什么要告诉你
Why would I ever tell you that?

325
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:31,730
因为她就要被人找到了
Because she's going to be found.

326
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:33,880
问题是  是要被他找到
The only question is, whether it's by him...

327
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,090
还是我们
or us.

328
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,370
决定权在于你
The choice is yours.

329
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:03,700
我们打烊了了  派对结束了
We're closed. Party's over.

330
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:04,800
我不是为此而来的
I'm not here for that.

331
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:07,340
我来是要寻求你的帮助
I'm here for your help.

332
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:10,720
我做过很多事
Hmm. I've been called many things.

333
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:13,230
乐于助人不是其中之一
Helpful isn't one of them.

334
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,900
我听说你能让人消失
I've heard you can make people disappear.

335
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,000
只要他本人不想再被人找到
people who never want to be found again.

336
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:21,280
也许可以  但是这件事的代价
Perhaps. But the cost of such a thing

337
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,290
可不算小
is significant.

338
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,480
我只有一件珍贵之物
I own but one thing of any value,

339
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:28,500
如果你帮我  它就属于你了
but you help me, and it shall be yours.

340
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,820
这叫做失物指南
It's called a Lost and Found.

341
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:37,010
它会指向你丢失在人生中
It'll point you to anything you've lost in your life

342
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:38,190
又希望找回的东西
and you wish to find again.

343
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:43,240
你一定是想消失想疯了
Ohh... oh, you must really want to disappear

344
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,080
才会用这东西来换
to give up this.

345
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,480
这是唯一能保证一个人安全的方法
It's the only way I can keep someone safe.

346
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,240
一个我深爱的人
Someone I care about very much.

347
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:55,110
我也许可以帮助你
I may be able to help you.

348
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:10,150
-你和红心王后曾经住在这里吗  -不
- Uh, you and the red queen used to live here?! - No.

349
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,470
红心王后不会出现在这种地方
The queen wouldn't be caught dead in a place like this.

350
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,790
住在这里的是安娜斯塔西娅和我
But a girl named Anastasia and I...

351
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,970
我们曾在这度过一段快乐的时光
We had a few laughs here.

352
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,700
为什么你能认定
What makes you think this is where

353
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,240
她会把兔子的家人藏在这里
she'd be holding rabbit's family?

354
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:26,800
安娜和我会时不时得到一些宝贵的东西
Every now and then, Anna and I would acquire something of value

355
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,990
并且要想藏好那些东西
that we wanted to keep hidden.

356
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,110
我们的小木车是个绝佳的储藏地
Our wagon turned out to be a lovely hiding place.

357
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,170
瞧  这从外面看上去又破又烂
See, if it looks this shabby on the outside,

358
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:36,850
根本没有人会向里面看一眼
no one ever bothers checking the inside.

359
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,540
等着
Wait here.

360
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:03,980
你总是先走一步  不是吗
Always a step ahead, aren't you?

361
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:17,690
告诉过你了  这没用的
I'm telling you, it's no use.

362
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:20,700
爱丽丝  如果王后...
Alice, what if the queen...

363
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,030
如果我的家人已经...
what if my family is...

364
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:25,610
爸爸
Daddy!

365
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:27,790
亲爱的
Darling!

366
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,820
珀西
Percy?

367
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:30,960
-我的孩子们  -珀西
- My babies! - Percy!

368
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,750
亲爱的
Ohh, dears!

369
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,820
我的小兔子
Ohh! My bunnies!

370
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,830
我的小兔子
My little bunnies!

371
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:40,000
我还以为我们再也见不到你了呢
I thought we'd never see you again.

372
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:43,380
爱丽丝  谢谢你为了让我们重新团聚
Alice... thank you for whatever you did

373
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,790
所做的事
to bring us back together.

374
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,110
不用客气
You're welcome.

375
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:49,510
好了  现在
Oh... okay, now...

376
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:53,140
记得我告诉过你们要信守承诺吗
Remember what I told you about always keeping your promises?

377
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:56,650
现在你们的父亲要开始履行自己的承诺了
Well, your father has to keep one of his now.

378
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:00,230
带他们到你母亲家去  我今晚去找你们
Take them to your mother's. I'll meet you there tonight.

379
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,310
小心些  亲爱的
Be careful, dear.

380
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,900
我难道不是一直很小心吗
Well, aren't I always?

381
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,640
你真想让我回答这个问题吗
Do you really want me to answer that?

382
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:08,510
好了  好了  我会小心的
Fine, fine. I'll be careful.

383
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,670
好了  孩子们  走了
All right, you two, come on, let's go!

384
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:13,000
好了  去哪
Okay. Where to?

385
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:16,740
去塞勒斯所在的地方  边境
Where Cyrus is going-- the outlands.

386
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,960
你凭什么可以认定她会去边境
Why are you so sure she'll be in the outlands?

387
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,920
因为她可以认定我会去那儿
Because she's sure that I'll be there.

388
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:33,000
你们俩还真是相当信任对方啊  不是吗
Ooh! You two have quite a lot of faith in each other, don't you?

389
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,140
如果连爱情都不能相信
Well, if you can't believe in love,

390
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,250
还能够信任什么呢
what can you believe in?

391
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:39,380
我信任什么与你无关
What I believe in is of no concern to you.

392
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:44,060
你心里有秘密  对吗
You have a secret, don't you?

393
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:47,850
别装作了解我
Don't pretend to know me.

394
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,450
我不需要了解你  当精灵当了这么久
I don't have to. Being a genie for so long,

395
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:51,990
我已经学会解读人心了
I've learned how to read people,

396
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,320
在人们开口之前我就能猜到他们想要什么
to know what they'll wish for even before they ask.

397
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,250
我想要你闭嘴
I wish for you to shut up.

398
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:05,340
你把愿望深深埋在心底  对吗
Your wishes are buried deep, aren't they?

399
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:06,610
别着急  精灵
Don't fret, genie.

400
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,760
你不用再担心这些了
You won't have to worry much longer.

401
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:10,620
你很快就会知道了
You're about to find out.

402
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,680
现在  告诉我我们还要赶多久的路
Now tell me how much farther until we're there.

403
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:16,900
快了  很快了
Soon. Very soon.

404
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:25,050
找到红心王后
Find the red queen...

405
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:27,930
然后杀了她
and kill her.

406
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:45,810
我听说过关于这座山顶的事
So I've heard stories of this mountaintop

407
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,430
在这里你可以真的站在云端
where you can actually stand on top of the clouds.

408
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:51,020
听上去不错
Yeah, sounds nice.

409
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,900
我想我们应该试试
I think we should try it.

410
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:54,580
就在我的伤好点之后
When I'm better.

411
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,630
塞勒斯
Cyrus?

412
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:01,630
怎么了
What's wrong?

413
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,010
爱丽丝  你还在恢复之中
Alice, you're still healing.

414
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,790
而事实是  无论我们走到哪里
And the fact is, wherever we go,

415
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:10,520
无论我们经历了怎样的冒险
whatever adventure we pursue,

416
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,500
跟我在一起  你是永远不会安全的
you'll never be safe with me.

417
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,620
塞勒斯  你已经把可能的危险告诉过我了
Cyrus, you've told me all these dangers,

418
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,870
我还是选择了你
and I still choose you.

419
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:18,990
但是  瞧瞧都发生了些什么
But look what happened.

420
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:22,560
也许我们陷阱了自己的幻想之中
Maybe we were lost in a fantasy.

421
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:27,160
我以为我可以保护你  但事实明显不是这样
I thought I could protect you, but clearly I can't.

422
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:29,970
塞勒斯
Cyrus--

423
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:32,000
我愿意不惜一切代价来保护你
I would do anything to protect you.

424
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:34,290
自己忍受痛苦也在所不惜
Even if I suffered for it.

425
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:37,020
你是想逃离我吗
Are you trying to run away from me?

426
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,190
如果这是唯一保证你安全的方法  我会的
I will if that's the only way I can keep you safe.

427
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,400
你有没有想过
Did you ever think

428
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:45,440
也许我才是保护你安全的人
that maybe I'm the one keeping you safe?

429
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:50,510
你的确很能战斗
You are pretty handy in a fight.

430
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,850
我不害怕这种生活  塞勒斯
I'm not afraid of this life, Cyrus.

431
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,680
唯一能伤害我的事
The only thing that could hurt me

432
00:28:57,490 --> 00:28:59,040
是与你的分离
is being apart from you.

433
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,880
我想到了你会这样说
I thought you might say that.

434
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,280
所以我为你准备了些东西  为我们俩
Which is why I've got something for you. For us.

435
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,160
什么东西
What is it?

436
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:11,960
看这里
Look right there,

437
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,630
那块大石头的旁边
Next to that big rock.

438
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:16,810
我什么也没看到
I don't see anything.

439
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:18,640
正是如此
Exactly.

440
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:22,220
跟我来
Follow me.

441
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:40,910
这是什么
What is this?

442
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,270
这是我们能消失的地方
Somewhere where we can disappear.

443
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,740
外面看不到这里
It's invisible from the outside,

444
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:48,930
而里面相当舒适
but on the inside, it's quite cozy.

445
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:50,960
这不是个理想的解决方式
It's not a perfect solution,

446
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,340
但起码是个开始
but it's a start.

447
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:54,470
这样我们就能随心所欲地冒险
Now we can go on any adventure we desire,

448
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:57,250
我们有这里  一个可以回来的地方
and we'll always have this, a place we can return to.

449
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:58,770
一个家
A home.

450
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:00,760
是啊
Yeah.

451
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,510
太好了
It's perfect.

452
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,680
你怎么得到这个地方的
How did you get such a place?

453
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,760
如果你可以用魔法把它创造出来
If your magic could create it,

454
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,300
为什么等到现在
why wait until now?

455
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,920
这不是我的魔法
It wasn't my magic.

456
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,400
塞勒斯  为了这个你放弃了什么
Cyrus, what did you give up for this?

457
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,440
我放弃的远没有我得到的多
What I gave up--it's nothing compared to what I gained.

458
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:28,280
有人说  牺牲是
You know, they say that sacrifice

459
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,360
衡量真爱的标准
is the measure of true love,

460
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:33,900
我会为你做任何牺牲
and I would sacrifice anything for you.

461
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:36,680
我也会
And I for you.

462
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,250
你觉得塞勒斯可能会来这见你
Is this where Cyrus is supposed to meet you?

463
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:49,980
是的
Yes.

464
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:51,750
塞勒斯
Cyrus?!

465
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,770
我不想扫了你的兴  爱丽丝
I don't want to burst your bubble, Alice,

466
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:55,830
但你所谓安全的地方可不那么安全
but your safe place isn't all that safe.

467
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,670
从几英里外就能看见你
You can be seen from miles.

468
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,680
也许  也许他藏起来了
Uh, maybe-- maybe he's hiding.

469
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,920
也许他在里面
Maybe he's just inside.

470
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:04,570
里面  什么里面
Inside? Inside what?

471
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,560
该死的
Bloody hell.

472
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:14,350
你来吗
You coming?

473
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:16,430
我最好待在外面
Uh, better I stay out here--

474
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:18,970
望望风  省得有人来找我们
Keep watch in case anyone comes looking for us.

475
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,590
别轻举妄动
Don't try anything funny.

476
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,950
我不想做兔子汤  你别逼我
I don't want to make rabbit stew, but I will.

477
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:25,620
我知道  当然不会  我们都不想这样
I know. Of course not. We wouldn't want that.

478
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,510
一直以来  我们都餐风露宿的
All this time, we've been using rocks for pillows,

479
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:36,980
我们本来可以睡这儿的
we could have been sleeping here.

480
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:38,830
我们一直都在四处奔波
We were on the move.

481
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:42,200
我是说  有个歇脚的地方
Wouldn't have been a bad place to rest me weary feet,

482
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,120
总是好的
is all I'm saying.

483
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:45,230
那是浴缸吗
Is that a bathtub?

484
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:51,120
没道理啊  他应该在这儿的
This doesn't make sense. He should be here.

485
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,680
-还有别的他可能去的地方吗  -没有了
- Anywhere else he might have gone? - No.

486
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:56,840
也许他留了纸条
Maybe he's left a note.

487
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,420
你以为我在找什么
What do you think I'm looking for?

488
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,400
这儿什么都没有
There's nothing here!

489
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,090
我知道你在想什么
I know what you're thinking.

490
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:07,940
我没想什么
I'm not thinking anything.

491
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,770
你在想他已经被抓住了
You're thinking he's been captured.

492
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:10,720
我可没说
Never said that.

493
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:13,250
你在想他在试图逃跑时被杀了
You think he died trying to escape.

494
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,870
还是你在想他从一开始就没能逃掉
Or do you think he didn't really escape in the first place?

495
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:17,350
我觉得他不在这儿  爱丽丝
I think he's not here, Alice,

496
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:19,660
也就是说我们快没时间了
which means we're running out of time.

497
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,220
也没有选择
And options.

498
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:23,780
兔子在外面
Now the rabbit's outside.

499
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:24,580
如果我们要离开仙境
If we're gonna leave Wonderland--

500
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,710
没有塞勒斯我们不会离开
We're not leaving without Cyrus.

501
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,130
我们不走
We're not.

502
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,520
塞勒斯
Cyrus?

503
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:40,890
爱丽丝  抱歉
Alice, I'm sorry.

504
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,420
-塞勒斯  -爱丽丝
- Cyrus! - Alice?

505
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:44,810
塞勒斯
Cyrus!

506
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:46,170
爱丽丝
Alice!

507
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,660
我以为我再也见不到你了
I thought I'd never see you again.

508
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:58,510
哪怕在梦里  我也不敢想象我们重逢的这一刻
Even in my dreams, I was afraid to imagine this moment

509
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:00,120
害怕它永远不会成真
and feared that it would never come true.

510
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:03,380
但你在这儿  你在这儿
But it's here. You're here.

511
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,600
我在这儿  都结束了
I'm here. It's over.

512
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,890
我可不敢说结束了
Well, I wouldn't quite say over.

513
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:16,740
你好啊  爱丽丝
Hello, Alice.

514
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,740
她在这儿干什么
What the bloody hell is she doing here?

515
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,280
她是来帮我们的
She's here to help us.

516
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,710
她要帮我们
She's going to help us?

517
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,440
你在开玩笑吧
You've got to be joking.

518
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,580
可没时间开玩笑  亲爱的
No time for joking, darling.

519
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,010
你看到那场逼近的暴风雨了吗
You see that storm coming?

520
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:52,820
那是贾法尔  他来找我们了  我们所有人
That is Jafar, and he's coming for us. For all of us.

521
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,560
她说的是真的  爱丽丝
She's telling the truth, Alice.

522
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,310
他为什么要抓你  你是他的搭档
Why would he be after you? You're his partner.

523
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:58,560
我曾经是他的搭档  没错
Was his partner. Yes, it's true,

524
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,450
我们曾经合作过  但我和他可不一样
we used to work together, but I am not like him.

525
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:05,110
当他开始不按规则出牌
When it became clear that he was no longer playing by the rules of the game-

526
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:05,950
别相信她
Don't believe a word.

527
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:08,620
她很会说谎
She knows how to lie, this one.

528
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:12,600
等我们离开仙境以后
We can argue all we like

529
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,430
想怎么吵就怎么吵  但现在
when we get out of wonderland, but for now,

530
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:15,720
快挖  兔子
dig, bunny!

531
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,010
我不会跟她一起走
I'm not going anywhere with her.

532
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,050
我们别无选择
We may not have a choice.

533
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,060
如果威尔是对的呢
What if Will's right?

534
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,630
如果一切都是精心策划的阴谋
What if this is an elaborate ruse?

535
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,550
爱丽丝  你还想让我干什么
Alice, what more do you want me to do?

536
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:25,980
我都把精灵给你带回来了
I brought you your bloody genie!

537
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,370
也是你把他从我身边夺走的
You took him from me, too!

538
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:30,240
爱丽丝  你得相信我
Alice, you need to trust me.

539
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,170
我永远不会相信你
I will never trust you!

540
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:32,810
爱丽丝
Alice.

541
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,640
告诉我理由
Tell me why.

542
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,660
为什么你做了这一切
Why you did all of this--

543
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,720
为什么你和一个疯子结盟
Why you made an alliance with a madman,

544
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:50,540
我会走
and I'll go.

545
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:53,510
但我需要一个理由
But I need a reason.

546
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,790
给我个理由
I need something.

547
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:01,610
我认为他能给我我想要的
I thought he could get me what I want.

548
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,820
-什么东西  -你已经拥有了一切
- And what was that? - You've got everything.

549
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:05,850
你还想要什么
What more could you need?

550
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:08,140
你  威尔
You... Will.

551
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:12,900
我想要你
I wanted you.

552
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,470
我想要你回来
I want you back.

553
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,800
又是谎话
More lies.

554
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,580
不  我现在说的都是实话  我说的是实话
No. I'm telling the truth now. I'm telling the truth.

555
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,680
你曾拥有过我  全心全意的我
You had me. All of me--

556
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,860
我的心  我的灵魂  我的一生
My heart, my soul... my life--

557
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,090
而你把我像垃圾一样丢在一边
And you tossed me aside like a piece of rubbish,

558
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:31,110
就为了那一顶红色王冠
all for a little red crown.

559
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:33,990
我犯了错  我现在意识到了
I made a mistake. I see that now.

560
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:35,340
难道你看不出我为什么这么做吗
Don't you see that's why I've done all this?

561
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,080
这样贾法尔就能改变这里的魔法法则
So Jafar can change the laws of magic

562
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:40,150
我们就能纠正错误  改变过去  威尔
so we can undo the mistake, change the past. Will!

563
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,270
威尔  等等
Will, wait.

564
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:45,640
我会放弃我的王冠  放弃一切
I would give up my crown. I would give up anything--

565
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:50,040
只为了回到你还爱着我的时候
everything just to go back to a time when you loved me.

566
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,660
求你了  威尔
Please, Will.

567
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,330
我想让你回心转意
I want you back.

568
00:35:58,850 --> 00:35:59,940
永远不可能了
You'll never have me.

569
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,880
你在这儿
There you are...

570
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:20,400
亲爱的
Darling.

571
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,890
一会见
See you soon.

572
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:35,310
听着  你不用接受我的道歉
Listen, you don't have to accept my apologies,

573
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:37,050
但是你得接受我的警告
but you do have to accept my warning.

574
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:39,970
精灵在这里  瓶子在这里
The genie's here. The bottle's here.

575
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,730
愿望宝石在这里  你觉得贾法尔
The wish is here. What do you think Jafar's

576
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:43,020
来了之后会做什么呢
gonna do when he arrives, eh?

577
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,630
我们会走的  你来回应他
We'll go, and you'll have to answer to him.

578
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:46,420
不  因为你忘了一件事
No, 'cause you're forgetting something.

579
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,540
瓶子在我手里
I have the bottle.

580
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,880
我很乐意替你掌管
Which I'll gladly relieve you of.

581
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,940
爱丽丝  没时间斗了
Alice, there is no time to fight.

582
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:53,030
再斗就只有死路一条  我们得离开
There's only time to die. We need to leave.

583
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:57,650
我们得离开  拜托  我说的都是实话
We have to leave! Now please! I'm telling the truth!

584
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,360
我永远都不会相信你
I will never trust you.

585
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,690
我也不会
Neither will I.

586
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:02,990
我信
I do.

587
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,880
我知道你许了秘密的愿望
I knew you had a secret wish.

588
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,490
她说的是实话  爱丽丝
She's telling the truth, Alice.

589
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,530
所以拜托  我们带着瓶子快离开这里吧
So, please, let's take the bottle and get out of here!

590
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:25,890
兔子  挖洞吧
Rabbit, dig your hole!

591
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,860
-去哪  -只要不是这里
- Where to? - Anywhere but here.

592
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:33,600
小心
Look out!

593
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,710
我扶你  我扶你
I got you. I got you.

594
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:48,280
怎么了  他
What happened? Is he--

595
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:49,710
爱丽丝
Alice!

596
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:53,220
怎么回事  发生了什么
What is it? What's happening?

597
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:56,980
她许下的第一个愿望
The first wish she made.

598
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:58,940
她是保护威尔不受贾法尔的伤害
She was protecting Will from Jafar.

599
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:01,010
如果红桃杰克死了  我也会死
If the knave dies, then I die, too.

600
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,710
你没有八天了
You don't have eight days.

601
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:07,880
威尔
Will.

602
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:12,310
爱丽丝
Alice.

603
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:14,620
爱丽丝
Alice?

604
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:17,150
你得听我说
I need you to listen to me, okay?

605
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,680
最后一个愿望  我们得用它来救你
That last wish--you need to use it to save yourself.

606
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,690
不  我不能让你回到瓶子里
No. I'm not gonna put you back in the bottle.

607
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,980
我不能再让你困在其中
I'm not gonna make you a prisoner again.

608
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,650
如果你能活着  我很乐意永远
I would gladly spend an eternity in that bottle

609
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:31,820
困在瓶子里
if you could live.

610
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:39,000
我爱你
I love you.

611
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,170
爱丽丝  不要
Alice, don't go.

612
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,100
爱丽丝  不许你这么对我
Alice, don't you do this to me.

613
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,050
我才刚找到你  我不能再失去你了
I've only just found you. I'm not gonna lose you again.

614
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:49,680
塞勒斯  我能救她
Cyrus! I can save her!

615
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:54,010
-怎么救  -因为那就是我的愿望
- How? -'cause that's my bloody wish!

616
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,290
他说什么呢
What's he talking about?

617
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:57,450
我不知道  是什么  威尔
I don't know. What, Will?

618
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:58,810
爱丽丝保证
Alice promised...

619
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,580
如果我帮她找到你
if I helped find you...

620
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,310
我就能得到一颗愿望宝石
I'd get a wish.

621
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:10,800
对我来说够了
That's good enough for me.

622
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:12,900
许愿要谨慎
Be very careful what you wish for, Will.

623
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:22,550
我希望
I wish...

624
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,150
结束爱丽丝的痛苦
to end Alice's suffering.

625
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:33,940
爱丽丝
Alice?

626
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:36,200
爱丽丝
Alice.

627
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:38,790
塞勒斯
Cyrus.

628
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:43,590
塞勒斯
Cyrus.

629
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:44,890
你还活着
You're alive.

630
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:46,970
但是为什么呢
But how?

631
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,800
红桃杰克  他使用了他的愿望
The knave-- he used his wish.

632
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:52,890
但那就是第三个愿望了
But that was the third wish.

633
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,150
你为什么没有在瓶子里
Why aren't you in your bottle?

634
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:00,390
我的束缚  不见了
My binds--they're gone.

635
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:04,910
消失了
They're gone.

636
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:08,500
爱丽丝  我自由了
Alice, I'm free.

637
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,150
我不明白
I don't understand.

638
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:13,950
红桃杰克
The knave--

639
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:17,020
他许愿要结束你的痛苦
He wished to end your suffering.

640
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,270
你有部分痛苦
Part of your pain

641
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:20,860
是不能够和自己所爱的人在一起
Was not being able to be with the one you loved.

642
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:22,710
威尔  你真是个天才
Will, you're a genius.

643
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,060
他在哪
Where is he?

644
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:26,770
消失了
He's gone.

645
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,510
他本来在这里  现在消失了
He was here, and now he's gone.

646
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:33,570
什么意思
What do you mean?

647
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:39,310
红桃杰克怎么了
What happened to the Knave?

648
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:44,010
-不  -什
- Oh, no. - Wh--

649
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:45,170
什么  他在哪
Wh-what?! Where is he?!

650
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:46,750
瓶子在哪
Where's the bottle?

651
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:09,100
该死
Ah, bloody hell.
